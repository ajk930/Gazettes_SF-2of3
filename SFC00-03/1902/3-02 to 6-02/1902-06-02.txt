In other restaurants similar
scenes were enacted. At the
Princes restaurant the orchestra
played all the patriotic tunes > it
knew and the diners sang "God
Save the King." It was,' .indeed;
Popping of Corks.
The Carlton.Club presented a
brilliant scene to-night. It
seemed as if all the West End
had gone there to dinner, for the
dining-room and restaurant were
packed the entire evening, while
the palm room was filled to over
flowing, and even the entrance
room in the Pall was pressed into
service for part of the overflow^
The general feeling was one of
great rejoicing. That numerous
toasts were drunk during the
evening goes without saying. The
orchestra, by general request,
played patriotic airs, ending with
".^ule, . Britannia," and'^Goci

arose and sang the $ hymns
through several* times.
With the approach of evening
the streets became more .and
more congested. Every bus had
a top load of shouting people,
who were cheered vociferously
by those on foot. Thousands
and thousands of little flags were
waved by the surging crowds,
while from hotels and office
buildings large flags were flung
to the wind. When darkness fell

When -I left the house it was

surpass even the wild enthusiasm

Almost every other person was
waving a small Union Jack at the
end of a cane or umbrella. Where
all of these flags came from is a

PARIS. June 2.â The news of -peace in
South Africa reached Paris too late for
publication in the afternoon papers, and
did not become generally known yesterday
evening and hence caused no excitement.
This morning's papers, however, give due
prominence to dispatches. announcing the

was received in London. 'The comments

war in South Africa. Official notice of
the signing of the terms of surrender
came to Mr. Raikes, the British charge
here, in a cablegram from . the foreign
office. It was very brief, and was in ac
cord with the statements contained In the
press dispatches. It probably will be com
municated formally to the United States
Government to-morrow. Nothing official
has reached the state department from
Kmbassador Choate at Ixmdon or any
other source. President Roosevelt was
furnished a copy of the press dispatch
giving the news of the signing of the'
articles of surrender.
The prevails in official . cir
cles that the terms of surrender named
by the BritiBh In their negotiations with
the Boers have been very liberal in char
acter, perhaps from the double desire to
bring the war to a close and to have this
happy event formally proclaimed before
the coronation of King Edward.
From a commercial point of view the
cessation of hostilities will result ben
eficially to American exports to South
Africa, the reports issued from time to
time by the foreign commerce bureau of
the Btate department showing that they
have suffered considerably since the be
ginning of the war.
Correspondents in South China report
the defeat of the Kwangsi rebels near
banning and the capture of Sung Yung
Seng, the leader. The Winchow corres
pondent of the Honkong Telegraph, de
scribing the battle in the hills near Nan

From an eye witness, I learn that the
affair seems to have been a very bloody
encounter. The. troops at first were un
able to rout the rebels but with the help
of two Maxims and a couple of â¢ twelve
pounders they forced them to scatter.
It was while leading his men and encour
aging them against, the Imperial troops
that the leader was wounded by a frag
ment of a shell and captured. He was
sent to Canton for punishment and ex
ecution.
Peking correspondents say the semi
foreign uniformed soldiers of Yuan Shlh
Kal who guarded the imperial cortege
en route to the eastern tombs created a
reign of terror on "the way, the villagers
mistaking. them for foreign troops. The
country people fled as soon as the pen

the organization of a police force has
been commenced at Wuchang, and an

The; Boxers first murdered a French

When the- general public celebrated the

Â«"7ual]y joyous, although not quite so
demonstrative. Many references were
made to the coincidence of the declara

"Good old Kitchener" and "We're bloom

shouted by the crowds. A large number
of those who had relatives at the front
participated in the street scenes and lent
a serious and often pathetic touch to
what would otherwise have been an
amusing scene.
Outside of Buckingham Palace, where
King Edward kept himself in seclusion, a
crowd of fairly good proportions gathered
and here, as elsewhere, the national an
them was sung lustily. Two sentries and
many policeman guarded the historic
message outside the War Office. It could
scarcely be read by the flickering gas
light. After reading this notice the people
passed on in eager crowds into the more
eastern districts of London, where there

Lord Mayor of London, Sir Joseph C

cheers the Lord Mayor made a short
speech, in which he expressed his hope
that London would show its appreciation
oi the good news by behaving itself de
cently and in an orderly manner. . '
"Let us." said he in conclusion, "now
pray for a long and happy peace."
At this statement the assemblage yelled
lustily, and at the instance of the Lord
Mayor gave hearty cheers for King Ed
v.ard. followed by others for the men'
who had died in South Africa since the
war commenced.
The Times, is equally certain that the
interests of the loyal colonists, whether
of Dutch or British blood, have not been
overlooked in the settlement.
The Times pays a tribute to the saga
cious and conciliatory diplomacy of Lord
Salisbury and Lord Lansdowne. the For
eJpn Secretary,- which has built up an
amicable understanding. It declares, with
the Lnited States and which has done so
much to sober' the reflections of less
friendly states. Â¦ Â¦ .
The Daily Telegraph says: "It is well
for Ensland that this crisis arose to be
encountered when it did. Later it. would
have been too late. The danger we have
met and mastered was a mortal danger
and England alone, of all the powers of
Europe, possesses wealth; energy, com

The dispatches received â¢ here from
South Africa describe the rejoicings in all
the principal towns there which followed
the announcement of peace yesterday,
and say that to-day CMonday) has been
proclaimed a general holiday. Â¦ '.
In an editorial on the news from South
Africa the Timeg points out that there
can be no treaty, but merely, as Lord
Kitchener" names it, a document contain
ing "terms of surrender." The Times is
confident that the terms offered to Gen
eral Botha a year ago have been virtu
ally maintained.
The Daily News says.: 'it will do most
to give us dignity and nobility In the hour
of victory if we pay homage to the im
mense and heroic courage oi our foes.
Let us think of them not as enemies, but
as the bravest fighters who ever met us
in the field."
PRAISES VALOR OF BOERS.
The Daily Chronicle says: "We have
gained peace with honor. If our staten
men are henceforth wise in making use
of their opportunities we shall find that
we have also gained peace with good
will." -
The Standard exhorts the nation to ac
cept its victory Jn a calm ana dignified
manner and not to indulge in unbecoming
or offensive demonstrations of jubila
tion.
Cabling from Pretoria, the correspond
ent of the Dally Mail, after announcing
the signing of the terms of surrender, says
the British authorities absolutely rejected
the suggestion of the Boer delegates that
the terms of surrender should be ratified
by Mr. Kruger, and declared that the
Boers in Europe had no hand in the set
tlement.
"The terms will show," continues the
correspondent, "that the British Govern
ment carried its contentions on every vital
point, while the minor concessions, par
ticularly those in regard to the generous
financial treatment, will greatly appeal to
the Boers in general. The value of Lord
Kitchener's personality as a factor in the
conclusion of peace can never be over
estitmated. There is no doubt that peace
will be popular among the Boers."
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
Liberal leader in the House of Commons,
said in an interview, on the announcement
of peace:
"The whole country will .rejoice over
peace. I know nothing of the terms or
conditions, but I hope they are such as
will be full of promise for the future."

CASTRIES, St. Lucia, June 1.â In
company with Professor T. A. Jag
ger of Harvard University, T. M.
McDonald and George C. Curtlss,
, I have made an ascent of St. Vin
cent's volcano, Soufriereâ the first ascent
since the terrible eruption which de
stroyed about 2000 lives. We have just re
turned here from. an interesting expedi
tion, which enabled us to obtain a survey
of the conditions on the Soufriere. In our
climbing we had the assistance of six
natives, who facilitated our work by their
knowledge of the volcano.
The^ old crater of Soufriere was the cen
ter of the ; disturbance. We found another
crater, which was a half-mile deep. There
was a small boiling lake at the bottom of
this crater. We found no evidence cf
molten lava having been erupted,. but the
Soufriere emitted vast quantities of ashes
and cinders. â¢
The volcano is still active and is" a dan
gerous spot for explorers. Report reached
us upon our return here that another
eruption ,took place at an early hour this
morning. There was a decided earthquake
disturbance. The summit of the Soufriere
was illumined by a fiery, vaporous mass.
EDMUND O. HOVEY,
Assistant Curator of the American Mu
seum of .Natural History.
News has reached here of another erup
tion of Mont Pelee, Martinique, on May
27. Owing to the great quantity of ashes
which fell on the British island of Do
minica that day, it is presumed that the
eruption which threw them out was of
great severity. Mont Pelee is still emit
ting vast columns of smoke and flashes of
lightning from It have been seen forty
and fifty miles from St. Pierre.
Owing to the continuous rain there have
been heavy floods in the windward dis

the storehouse,' a large brick . building,
was washed into the sea by a stream of
mud. The wharf at Rabacca and the car

Early Friday morning General Torres
sent a messenger to Hermosillo, who
brought news that the regulars and vol
unteers, who had joined them, recaptured
the Camou mill late Thursday afternoor.
The Mexican troops pursued a band of 300
retreating Yaquis toward El Tanque.
About half-way to that place the Mexi

and a fight ensued. The Yaquis were de

retreated In the darkness, carrying off
their wounded and leaving twenty dead.
Many rifles and a large suppJy of ammu

news that a large band of Yaquis ha<i
attacked the Camou mill, nine miles from,
Hermoslllo, and captured It. The milL
was defended by twenty-five Mexicans'
under command of Joaquln Rodriguez,
but they were unable to withstand the.

EACH COLLIERY FENCED IN.
Every colliery in the coal belt has either
a board or barbed wire fence around it.
At some of ?'â¢e mines "camps" cars are
lying on the siding for the accommodation
of. non-union men, most of whom will live
in' the colliery during the suspension.
It was very quiet around strike head
quarters to-day. President Mitchell spent
the day in going over correspondence. His
only visitors were Charles H. Schad,
Sheriff of Lacka wanna County, in which
Scranton Is located, and | a friend of the
Sheriff. There was some speculation re
garding the object of such visit. Sheriff
Schad to-day posted a notice at each col
liery in Lackawanna County warning all
persons not employed at the mines to
keep away from those properties and not
to violate the law Jn any way.
At the meeting of the firemen and engi
neers employed in the collieries of the
Susquehanna Coal Company, the Alden
Coal Company and the two collieries of
the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
Company, held at Nanticoke tÂ«>-day, it
was decided by a vote of about two to
one not to strike.
A joint meeting of the brotherhoods of
railway engineers, firemen, trainmen,
switchmen, conductors and telegraphers
employed by the Central Railroad of New
Jersey was held at Ashley to-night. A
resolution was adopted pledging the co
operation of all railroaders, if such a
move were necessary in order for the
miners to win their strike.
SPECIAL GUARDS ON DUTY.

Public Sentiment Opposes Their Em-
HAZLETON, Pa., June 1.â The several
hundred special officers brought here last
night for guard duty at the collieries in
the Hazleton district were distributed to
day. They will be housed and boarded at
the breakers. Public sentiment here is
against the special officers. â¢ Some of
the mine workers' leaders believe the
officers are non-union firemen and pismp
runners.
The plan of the coal companies to ex
change engineers, firemen and pump-run
ners who expressed a willingness to work,
but not in their own district, has been
frustrated by the mine-workers by the
issuance of orders to the engineers, fire
men and pump-runners who remain
away from their posts, to report at head
quarters to-morrow. In this way the
unicn will keep track of all hands. The
leaders assert to-night that all of the fire
men and pump-runners will strike. They
are not sure of tka engineers, but believe
that only a small portion of the latter
will continue to work.
The coal companies' agents say they
are prepared to fill the places of all strik
ers .and that the calling out of the en
gineers, firemen and pump-runners will
not cause them any hardship.
In some quarters the belief prevails
that if the companies succeed in keeping
their fires and pumps going, an effort will
be made within two weeks to resume the
mining of coal at some collieries with
non-union men. Â¦
District President Duffy spent to-day
in Panther Creek Valley, where It was
reported there was danger of the defec
tion of some of the firemen and pump
runners.
The scene that occurred here last night
upon the arrival of a deputation of special
officers was repeated at 7 o'clock to-night,
when about twenty officers in charge of a
coal company agent boarded a trolley car
at the Hazleton House for Freeland. The
streets were crowded, and when the of

rushed at them hissing and yelling. It
WIL.KESBARRE, Pa., June Lâ The eve
of what is looked upon as a most com
plete week in the progress of tne anthra
cite coal miners' strike finds the entire
region in apprehensive mood.
At 7 o'clock in the morning the order
of the United Mine Workers of America,
calling out all the stationary engineers,
firemen and pumpmen, unless the com
panies grant them an eight-hour work
day at present wages, will go into effect,
end no one can. forecast the outcome of
the new move. Victory for either side
will be of immense advantage and both
parties to the contest are striving w T ith
al! the power at their command to win.
If the union succeed in shutting down the
pumps the mine properties will suffer
damage that may reach into millions of
dollars, and if the employers should be
cble to keep the water out of their work
ings without the aid of organized labor it
means that the power of tne union in the
anthracite region has reached Its limit
eiid that all help In the effort to force the
mine owners to grant the demands of the
Teat army of 14/,<kxi men must come rrom
tome outside source. The mine workers
eay they will preserve the property of the
companies if tne engineers, pumpmen and
liremen are given what they asked for,
but the companies say they will permit
no outsiders to fix the hours and wages
of their men. Neither side to-night shows
the slightest disposition to yield.
FEARS OF DISTURBANCES.
President Mitchell said to-night that
this was the tirst time in the history of
his organization that the union was com
pelled to call out this class of employes
and thus endanger the safety of the
Biines. In all other Instances, he said,
the demands were granted. ...
There is a fear throughout the coal belt
that the coming week will witness more
or less disturbances. To-morrow is looked
upon by well informed persons as a crit
ical day, but it Is not expected that any
very serious trouble will occur. It is a
fact that the labor leaders have counseled
the strikers to remain quiet and commit
no violation of the laws. It is claimed
by the union that nearly all of the pump
men and firemen will quit work and that
about three-quarters of the engineers also
will refuse to continue work. This claim
was privately admitted to-day by a com
pany official familiar with the situation.
While the plans of the union have not
been made public, it, is known that a
thorough system has been mapped out
with a view of getting out those men who
will refuse to quit to-morrow. A house
to-house canvass will be started, which
r.o doubt will have much effect.' The
methods that have been adopted in re
rard to* the non-union men who will take
the strikers' places are not known. .
Practically all the non-union men to be
employed are now in the region. The
companies say that the number of those
who have volunteered to fill strikers'
places has been large and that no diffi
culty has been encountered in selecting
good men. An army of approximately
COO0 armed coal and iron policemen, sworn
in under a law of the State of Pennsylva
nia, Is In the field to-night, ready to pro

LOS ANGELES.
The afternoon game was a little better
as far as the error column of the locals
is concerned, but quite as bad for general
listlessness on the part of some of the
fielders. Siagle was the worst offender.
He allowed three easy hits to get past
him In rightfield, one of which rolled un
der the fence and counted as a homo run.
Rube Waddell- pitched great ball, ..but
ecemed to lose heart after the fourth in
ning. Glendon allowed only three hits,
one of them being: Waddell's two-bagger.
Score afternoon game:
. LOS ANGELES, June 1.â San Francisco
took both games to-day by putting up a
fast quality of baseball, N while most of
the Los Angeles team played like . a lot
of amateurs. Especially Isithls true of
the morning game. All sorts of errors
Â¦were made, unt.l the column footed seven.

OAKLAND.
The Senators never seemed to have a
chance, with Ewinp's erratic left-hander.
He had them at his mercy at all stages
of the play. Dowling pitched a gilt-edge
article of ball, but every hit made off his
delivery counted like money on pay day.
The score:
Josh Rellly, cheery Bill Devereaux,
Julie Streib, Cristall and Dunleavy were
the heroes of the game. All were given
a liberal hand for the -wonderful plays
they" made. Reilly picked up two appa
rently impossible stops at third and
robbed Devereaux and McCreedle of two
as clean base hits as ever left a bat.
Devereaux's play was just like Reilly's,
and Truck Eagan was the victim. Streib,
by a great one-hand stop, robbed Hogan
of a nice single and doubled up Graham
at second. Dunleavy made a great run
ning catch in left field. Cristall retired
the Senators without allowing a man to
gret as far as second base.
AH four of Oakland's runs were the re
eult of timely batting, and all -were well
earned and subbornly contested. Great
work with the willow was shown by Mc-
Creedie. Dunleavy, Francks and Streib.
Most of the tallies were registered when
two had been sent to the bench. Dun-
Ifavy's three-cushion wallop to far left
field was the choicest of the collection,
and it scored Streib from first. â¢' .
The weather was a treat in both games.
The play in the struggle at Eighth street
was in keeping with the beautiful June
day. The game went like a racing auto
mobile through -a. mud bank at the bot
tom of a hill, and was full of surprises
and snappy work from the cry of "Play
ball" until Hulen retired by the Mohler-
Streib route, '
FOR the fourth time In the last
month the members of the cham
pion' Oakland ball team have
turned their backs on old Recre
-ation Park with a cigar lead in the
pennant race. Yesterday was even a
nicre memorable occasion than the rest,
for the fast nine which flies the colors of
Cal Ewing established a' few, records that
stand unequaled on a California diamond
in recent years and are liable to stand
ior ail time In this league.
OaKland has played Sacramento thir
teen games, and of that number has won
eleven straigr.t, tied the famous nineteen
inning contest and lost but one. its pres
ent standing is .733, wnicn leads i^os An
geles by .loo points. It will take marvel
ous playing on the part of the other teams
to oust me champions from their great
lead.
lefeterday afternoon's game will Â«o
down in baseball history as a wonder.
Cristall, the Cleveland soutnpaw, pitched
Ior the cnamps and retired, the Senators
without either a run or a hit, establish
ing a record which cannot be beaten and
in all probability will not be equaled. Not
an errur was made by any of tne eighteen
p.ayers engaged in the struggle. Some
of the most brilliant fielding ever seen
on a ball field was done by both sides.
Both games resulted in Oakland's favor
morning'6 to 2 and afternoon 4 to 0.
The main attraction on the card was
the resurrection of the time-honored Rube
Levyâ old Rubeâ who was a familiar sight
on the historical Hal~ht-street grounds
when most of the present players were
wheeled to the games in baby carriages.
Rube was reincarnated by kindly Mike
Fisher and gamboled around the left field
green. It remains for trie fans to say
whether the veteran will continue in base
ball or retire to the woods.

The following matches were played on
the park courts: George Bates beat
Charles Dunlap. 6-3, and tied Harry
Routh, 6-4, 3-6; H. A. Turner beat R.
Turner, 6-4. I
Grant Smith won the tennis champion- j
ship of San Francisco yesterday on the
California Club courts. The new.cham
pion played a clever game that proved
much too strong for his opponents. In the
final match Smith had for his opponent
William B. Collier, who, from the form
ho displayed on Friday, was thought to
have a good chance of winning the tour
nament. After beating \ K. N. "Whitney
Collier looKed like a sure winner, but he
was outplayed' at every point of the game
by Smitn. Tne latter s serving was par
ticularly strong ana his volleying accurate
and swift. In this match Smim won tne
lirst two 'sets with the loss of but two
games. In the third and last set he again
ran the score up to 5-1 in his favor and
linally won out 6-3. The complete score
W As was expected, the matches yesterday
were much better than those on friuay.
By far the best match of the tournament
was that between Percy Murdock the
Alameda champion, and fcJmith % Murdock
was rattier slow to start and bmith tooK
the first set 6-1. In the second set and
the beginning of the third Smith tried to
win from the back; court. MurdocK soon
ran the score up to set all and 3-1 in his
favor, at whlph point Smith changed hi.s
tactics and essayed a net game. The lat
ter was strong at the net and won five ou.
of the next six games. The complete
score in favor of Smith was 6-1, 3-b. b-4.
Murdpck played an accurate driving
game, but his opponent beat him out on
steadiness. â ,
The other match of the semi-finals was
also an interesting one. In it Sherwood
Adams was opposed to W. B. Collier. The
former made a much better showing in
this match than was expected. In the rirst
set the score stood 5-4 and 40-30 in favor
of Adams. At this point Adams- was a
trifle overanxious and netted an easy
ball. The match finally .went to Collier,
the score being 9-7, 6-4. â¢ "
A large crowd was on hand to witness
the final match, which was expected to
prove a good one. Smith made a runaway
affair of itâ too one-sided to be Interest
ing. Collier tried every style of play dur
ing the match, but his opponent had him
beaten from all parts of the court. The
San Francisco championship was inaugu
rated last â¢ year, when it was " won by
George Whitney.
The class singles tournament com
menced on Golden Gate Park courts last
Sunday was finished yesterday. In the
first class Charles Dunlap defeated Harry
â¢ Routh in straight sets. This was unex
pected, considering the showing made by
each in the California Club tournament.
The score was 6-3, 6-3, 7-5. â¢ In the second
class M. C. Campbell won easily. Camp
bell was formerly in the first class and
will probably olay there in the future.
In the semi-finals he beat Clarence Cole
man, 6-4, 6-3 and in the finals he disposed
of Ed Finnigan in easy fashion. The score
was 6-2, 6-1. This is the first time Dun
lap and Campbell have won the cups.
The following -practice matches were
played on the California Club courts: J.

sues and Causes a Decrease
EFFECT OF BORAX
ON HUMAN t SYSTEM
Interferes With the Renewal of Tis-
in Weight.
BERLIN, June 1.â Experts attached to
the Imperial Health Office have published
a bulk-in pamphlet giving the results of
their protracted experiments to determine
the effect of bprax upon the human sys
tem. The tests were made upon four men
and were carried on for two years. Ac
cording to the pamphlet, the tests have
proved that borax in the human system
retards the assimilation of albumen and
fats and interferes in the renewal of tis
sues. A single dose, of borax remains in
a man's body for eight days. The con
tinued use of borax even in small quanti
ties causes an excessive loss of liquids
and a decrease in weight, without in
creasing the subject's thirsty or hunger.
In some cases these phenomena assume
a threatening aspect.
AUSTRIA AND HUNGARY'
FACE SERIOUS CRISIS
Much Depends Upon the Tact of Ein-

premier. Dr. von Koerber, in which' the
speaker Intimated "that, much as Austria
desired to maintain its friendship with
Hungary, there were certain lengths of
concession to which it was impossible for
Austria to eo, it tvas not intended to be
aggressive toward Hungary. Neverthe
less there is no doubt that a serious crisis
exists, and that everything depends upon
the tact of Emperor Francis Joseph,
whose Intervention has become Inevitable.
It is expected that His Majesty will sup
port Dr. von Koerber's position.

FIVE PRISONERS ESCAPE i
FROM JAIL AT LEADVILLS
Who Kijled Two Deputies at
Kokomo.
Among Them Is a Daring Criminal
LEADVILLE. Colo., June 1.â A daring
jail-break took place here to-day about J
p. m. Five prisoners from the County
Jail are now at large. The jailer was in
the front office when a trusty notified
him that some of the prisoners were miss
ing, and an investigation showed that
"Pug" Ryan, Ben Gray. Herman Guest,
Max Bowen and Jim Sullivan had escaped
by an underground passage. They had
sawed off the lock of A trapdoor leading
to a sewer, broke the sewer wall and then
crawled to the outside of the jail through
a small hole In the foundation wall. Ryan
is a desperate criminal and had been
brought here from Breckenridge for salu
keeping. He was the leader of a gang of
desperadoes that terrorized the mountain
towns several years ago, and during a
battle with deputies at Kokomo In the
summer of 1898 he killed two of them,
Sumner Whitney and Ernest Leonard.
Ryan succeeded in making his escape but
was captured In Seattle.
ACCTJSES HIS COMRADE
'OF DECLARING HIM DEAD
Mining Engineer on His "Way to Pas-
adena to Prove His Terres
trial Activity.
PASADENA, June 1.â Relatives of J. A.
Adams, the mining engineer, who was re
ported killed on the Mojave Desert, have
heard that he is alive and en route here
to prove that J. P. Fay, who assumed his
identity, spoke falsely. Adams and Fay
were prospectors together. One day Ad
ams wandered away and Fay thought him
lost. He took Adam's -credentials and
represented himself as Adams, a licensed
mining engineer, presented himself to
Alderman Ashworth of Colorado Springs
and asked for employment. Ashworth,
suspecting wrongdoing, broke the story
down, and Fay confessed. Relatives of
Adams heard of this and investigation
has elicited that Adams was not killed,
but "was lost and rescued, spending some
time in a hospital. He is a grandson of
John Brown of Harpers Ferry fame.
Letter Found on the Deceased Show3
That the Act Was Pre
meditated.
MEMBER* OF A SUICIDE
CLUB POISONS HIMSELF
CHICAGO, June 1.â A letter found In
the, possession of L. Wachman, a trav
eling salesman, who committed suicide
in a North Clark street saloon early to
-day, leads to the belief that he was a
member of a "New York suicide club.
From passages in the letter It is thought
that another member of the club com
mitted suicide last week in New York
City. Wachman fell dead while being
served with a glass of beer.
Physicians who examined the "body de
clared it was a case of poisoning. â¢"
A bottle of poison bearing the name of
a small town in California was found in
Wachman's pocket. The letter ' which
leads to the theory that the suicldt; was
premeditated affair was from T. Wolf,
N: ew York, dated - May 25th. The missive
was written in German and was poorly
spelled. such parts of it, however,
as could be understood It was gathered
that Wolf'and Wachman were members
of an organization, the members of which
pledged themselves to end their lives.

WASHINGTON, June 1.â Under the
terms of the unanimous agreement
reached last Wednesday the Senate will
\t;te at 4 o'clock Tuesday on the bill pro
viding: a form of civil government for the
Philippine Islands, and the entire inter
vening time of the. Senate's sessions will
be devoted to fifteen-minute speeches on
the bill. The Senate will meet at 11 o'clock
on Monday and on Tuesday for the pur
pose of giving additional time for the dis
cussion. A large number of short
speeches will be made, but no order for
their delivery has been agreed on.
The general understanding is now that
on Wednesday, after, the disposal of tho
Philippine bill, the Nicaragua canal bill
will be called up and made the regular
order of business. An effort will be made
to substitute for the ' Nicaragua bill the
bill introduced by Senator Spoonerj leav
ing to the discretion of the President the
selection of an isthmian canal route, and
its champions are claiming a majority of
the Senate will support them. The friends
of the Nicaragua route, and also the ad
vocates of a policy that would leave the
President discretion as to the route, now
say there is no necessity or prospect for
prolonged debate. A number of speeches,
however, have already been announced.
Senator Hanna will speak at length for
the Spooner bill, as will Senator KiU
redge. Among those who hav-2 indicated
their purpose of addressing the Senate in
the Interest of the Nicaragua route are
Senators Harris, Mitchell, Foster of Lou
isiana, Turner and Morgan.
The present understanding is that the
Cuban reciprocity bill will not be dis
cussed during the week. That measure is
still in committee, but probably will be
reported on Tuesday or Wednesday, its
terms having- been practically agreed on
by the Republican members of the com
mittee, and Senator Platt of Connecticut,
chairman of the committee, having indi
cated his purpose to lay the bill before
the full membership at an early day. /
The- bill agreed on provides for-' a
straight reduction for live years of 20 pei"
cent of the duty on Cuban goods coming
into the United States, without imposing
conditions as to immigration and labor,
or, indeed, any other conditions.
It is the present intention to have the
Republican Senators caucus on the bill
when reported, with the hope of making
it a party measure and thus avoiding tho
division in the party ranks which was
experienced over the question in the
House of Representatives.
The naval and District of Columbia ap
propriation bills probably will be reported
during the week, but their Immediate con
sideration will depend largely on tho
readiness of Senators to continue the dis
cussion of the canal question.
During the coming week the House
probably will act on three important bills
which the Rules Committee decided some
time ago to bring before that body at the
earliest opportunity. These are the anti
anarchy, the Pacific cable bill and the
Senate irrigation bill. No time limit is to
be set on the anti-anarchy bill, considera
tion of which will be entered on to-mor
row, but it is not believed that it will oc
cupy more than two days.
A day is to be -given to" the bill for the
Government cable to the Philippines and
three days to the irrigation bill. In case
the general deficiency, the last of the bis
appropriation bills, is ready before the
end of the week, the programme abov-3
outlined may be Interrupted, as appro
priation bills and conference reports are
to have the right of way.
. WASHINGTON, June 1.â The following
correspondence "between General Brugere
of the French mission to participate iii
the Rochambeau statue exercises and
President Roosevelt was made public to
day: , Â¦ . Â¦
BOSTON, May 31, 1002â His Excellency
Theodore. Roosevelt, President or .the United
States: Before my departure for 'France,
whither important duties call me, I desire to
address to you, Mr. President, and also to the
Government and people of ' the United States,
the thanks of the French mission for the kind
ly and warm welcome which it has received in
your beautiful country. We take back with
ui after too short stay In this hospitable land,
an inetraceable souvenir. We have here found
brighter than ever the remembrance of the
brotherhood in |rms which united Washing
ton's soldiers to those of Kochambeau, and it
la particularly pleasant to me to think that
our visit may have contributed- to draws, still
closer the bonds of traditional. friendship, whicn
for more thanja century have existed' between
the" United States and Franca.". Â¦
Permit me, Mr. President, to thank you per
sonally for the hearty sympathy. ' which you
have been pleaaed to manifest tome, and to in
torm you tnat we all entertain the best wished
for .your prosperity and 'for that of the great
American nation, the friend Of France.
- GENERAL, BnUGBKE. .
WHITE HOUSE. WASHINGTON June 1.
1002. â General Brugere, Boston: Ac,cept my
most hearty thanks ior your courteous mes
sage. It has given our people genuine pleas
ure not merely, to receive tnc Embassy from
our great sister republic ";on such an occasion
as tiiis. but especially to. recerye "an Embassy
composed of such men as those whom Presi
dent Loubet has sent hither. "Your visit has
done good in more ways than one, , and on be
half of the American people I , again . desire to
express .to you how sincere has been our wel
come and to wish' all happinexs in the present
and in the future to you and to the nation you
represent. THEODOUE ROOSEVELT Â¦
BOSTON, June 1,â Trie" sentiments of
gratitude leltv by the members of the-mis
sion delegated uy. the President of France
to attena -the unveiling at Washington of
the statue of the Count de Kochambeau
fcund xinal expression this afternoon on
the battleship Gaulois, which conveyed
the mission to this country and late this
afternoon left for Lisbon, whence it will
go to France..
A dinner was served on the battleship
Gaulois, attended by the. special repre
sentatives of President Roosevelt, repre
sentatives of the State of Massachusetts
and the city of Boston, the members of
the French Embassy at Washington and
the members- of the Rochambeau mission.
The afterdeck of the Gaulois, where the
dinner was served, was transformed into
a bower of beauty under a canopy.
Around were arranged the flags of the
French and the American republics.
When the Gaulois steamed out of the
harbor, aceompanied by. the battleship
Kearsarge and the cruiser Olympia, she
fired the national salute of twenty-one
guns, which was returned by the Olym
pia.

LONDON, June 1.â The most interesting
question to-day in connection with the
Stock Exchange is whetlier or 'not the
steady upward tide of the past week .will
spend itself in the fu.ee of the official an
nouncement of peace. The general impres
sion is that this tide- will not stop, al
though prices generally, considering the
trade outlookj^are Quite high. There is,
apparently, still enough reserve force in
the market to produce at least a moderate
sentimental spurt coincident with the
oliicial announcement, of peace. Indeed,
the more optimistic observers look ior
ward to a prolonged boom and only a few
conservatives profess to believe tnat the
advance has already been discounted. Ono
thing is certain, that the professional ele
ment is in a state of high tension and
praying that for a while ac least the pub-
Jic will come in and buy patriotically and
recklessly.
Conditions are not altogether favorable
for lively trading. Money was decidedly
scarce at the recent settlement. and a big
speculative account is already*', open for
tne rise. It is also fully expected that at
a meeting of the discount houses, to bo
held June 3, it will be decided to put up
the rates. Still, the tone of the market
has been remarkably cheerful, consols
closing last week at the highest point of
the year, and the American outlook is
rapidly clearing on better money, the crop
outlook and .hopeful reports of the set
tlement of the strike.- London rails, both
provincial and home, fared very well last
week. High investment stocks had a good
week and speculative buying has forced,
up the cheaper securities. The chief fear
for the Stock Exchange is that it may be
swamped by an excessive load of . new
loans and new companies which are now
eagerly awaiting flotation. â¢ .-rC
The chief feature of the American sec
tion of the market has been .the strength
of Canadian Pacific, rumor having it that
the Canadian Government arfd certain
American magnates are bidding against
each other for control of the Canadian
Pacific lines.
.Foreign bonds generally were strong on
the signing of the arbitration agreement
between Chile and Argentina.
Mines still have an upward tendency,
but constitute one of the most cautious
sections of the market. s.
Much quiet realizing is proceeding
among a class which has had its money
locked up for a long time past.
BERLIN, June 1.â The Boerse has had
the best week it has known for months
and values rose in all departments. Berlin
caught London's optimism regarding
peace in South Africa, The activity in
Kaffirs in London is strongly reflected
here.
I The shares of the Hamburg-American
i. and the North German Lloyd lines were
i the strongest on the market and 'were
bought even by outsiders. The public
takes an optimistic view of the agreement
between these lines and the Morgan syn
dicate as it affects the German lines, but
shipping experts do not regard with favor
the earning prospects of the navigation
syndicate. Much attention has been at
tracted here to the statement and figures
of an important personage in the steam
ship business to the effect that the Mor
gan syndicate will be unable to earn divi
dends because it is heavily overcapital
ized. ;,v ;
Emperor William has sent a telegram
to Herr Ballin, general manager of the
Hamburg-American line, congratulating
him on the excellent terms of the agree
ment reached with the Morgan syndicate.
WASHINGTON. June 1.â The ancient
palace of Charlemagne in Germany is be
ing renovated with Georgia pine. Cali
fornia plums and pears are preferred in
th<? empire to the formerly famous fruits
from near-by Italy. Servia and Bosnia,
â¢tfid American machinery is being used
to improve the water works of Aix la
Chappelle. These are some of the facts
made in an extract from Commercial Re
lations for 1901. made public by Frederic
Emory, Chief of the Bureau of Foreign
Commerce, to-day.
An alarming condition brought out in
the publication Is the fact that the Ger
mans are copying American-made articles
eo closely that the imitations bid fair to
make serious inroads on the sale of the
genuine goods. Says the extract:
In epite of the trad* depression prevailing; in
Germany Imports of American goods *re ad
vancing, according to the reports of tnoCon
eular ctficers in that country, especially m cer
tatn lines. Our chairs and desks, says Con
tul n. A. A man of Breslau. are kept in stock
fcy the dealers in that city. Other officers
inenticn the same articles, but Consul Ozum
of HtuttRart notes that the competition of Ger
man articles copied after American patterns is
making inroad? into what otherwise would be
a splendid market for our goods. Consul Har
ris of Mannheim says that while eighteen
months ago our office furniture had the field
almost wholly to itself, to-day roll top desks.
file cases, bookkeei>ers' desks, typewriters'
desks and ether office furniture of American
design, but of German make, are entering the
market.
The same, he tays, is true of bath tubs and
other stationary appliances. Nevertheless our
goods are making their way.
There has been a decided Increase in the
quantity of American articles appearains in
the shops of Alx la Chapelle during the past
j-t.ars. says Consul Brundaee.
Consul General C. L,. Cole says that there is
an apency for an American steam automobile
company in Dresden.
A well known American harvesting machine
company recently has established a geniyal
tfTPncy in Mannheim and the prospects for trade
ai<Â» pood.
Most varieties of American canned fruits.
Fays Consul J. White of Hanover, are preferred
to the native products. â¢
According!- to Consul Baehr at Magde
burg. California plums last year supplant
ed the Bosnian and Servian product,
â¢which formerly had held the market "^Tie
California plum was of better quality and
cheaper. Dried California pears, well
packed in cases, were imported in- great
quantities and sold at comparatively low
prices. The demand for our pears is con
stantly increasing, to the detriment of
the trade in Italian fruit. American ap
ples were also imported in large quanti
ties.
Values Rise in All the De
partments on the Berlin
Boerse.
There Is Little Likelihood of
There Being a Long

"'I have not been in favor of permanent dominion
over' the Philippines.' said Spooner, 'but I do not
mean by that that I have been in favor of the United
States running away like a coward and abandoning
a, people who have come under our protection, or
surrendering them to tyranny, anarchy and â¢ chaos.'
He said he had neve;- been able to contemplate with
equanimity the admission of the ' Philippines /as
a 1 : State or States. Nothing was dearer to him, -ex-
One of the salient features of the debate is the
revelation that neither in the bill itself nor in the
speeches of its supporters is there given any definite
statement of the intention of the United States Gov
ernment with respect to the Philippines. An illus
tration of the vagueness of the statements on that
point is to be found in the speech of Senator Spooner
on Saturday. Spooner is one of the foremost law
yers and logicians of Congress. No man in that body
is better fitted to make a .definite statement of his
own views, nor has any single man more authority
to .speak for his party. Yet from the telegraphic
summary that has been given of his speech the
reader can gather almost any idea except an idea of
what Spooner's policy is, or what lie would like the
Government's policy to be.
In the report of that point of the. Senator's speech
the dispatches say: -
The bill is supposed to represent a party policy,
and to some extent it does so, for it is an adminis
tration- measure. Nevertheless, one of the ablest
arguments and most, earnest utterances against it
was made by Senator Hoar, a life long Republican,
and one of the foremost exemplars of the party;
while about as vigorous and efficient a speech as has
been made in favor of- it was that of Senator Mor
gan; a life long Democrat, and the most eminent and
strenuous representative of Southern Democracy
now in Congress. With Tillman of South Carolina
and Hoar of Massachusetts, on one side, and Mc-
Laurin of South Carolina and Lodge of Massachu
setts on the other, how can it be a partisan ques
tion? Yet it is so considered, and we shall doubtless
hear a good deal 6f it from the stump during the
coming Congressional elections.
DEBATE may be said to have literally raged
around and about the Philippine bill in the
Senate for a long time. Very little of it,
however, has ever touched the bill. With the excep
tion of the speech of Senator Lodge in favor of it,
and that of Senator Bacon in opposition/ hardly a
single clear cut discussion of the details, or even the
principles underlying the measure, has been uttered
on either side. So far away from the bill itself has
the debate ranged that a man might read nearly all
that "has been said on each side without getting a
definite idea of .what the measure purposes to. do.
THE PHILIPPINE BILL.
Since an officer of the Russian army has been
found guilty of exposing the nature of the Russian
frontier fortresses to the German Government, it is
said the Russians have decided to make the fortresses
more formidable than ever, so of course Germany
will have to imitate the example, and that is the
way the money goes in Europe. ;
The above features, summarized, indicate consid
erable irregularity in business. The general firmness
and gradual advance in quotations which have been
the rule for several years have been succeeded by
hesitations here and there, with, occasional lulls,
which, though heretofore succeeded by renewed ac
tivity, are recurring with increasing frequency. The
banks are watching this change in conditions with
observant eyes, and are admonishing people to go
slowly. Indeed, it has been a source of surprise to
the great financiers of the country that the wave of
prosperity has - continued as long as it has with
hardly any break. We have enjoyed probably the
longest period of trade activity and buoyancy that
the country has ever witnessed, and more or less re
cession and inactivity may be expected at any time.
Some -of the longest financial heads in New York
predicted a halt two years ago* and though it oc
curred it was of brief duration and was followed by
renewed activity in the course of several weeks. We
are now entering upon the summer season, and it is
too much to expect lively times all the year round.
Perhaps several months of decreased activity would
be the best thing that could happen to general busi
ness, especially at this' time when money is plentiful
all over the country. A lull in trade means a decrease
in production and stocks of goods and adjusts condi
tions for lively times again later on. .
Against these quieter lines, however, the regular
commercial reports call attention to smaller failures,
an increase of 9 per cent in the railway earnings
over last year at this time and a fine demand every
where for lumber, hardware and almost all material
employed in the construction of buildings. The ex
ceptionally cool weather all over the country, how
ever, has curtailed the retai) and jobbing trade and
checked considerable reorder business. The crops
of the country are looking very well as a rule, and
collections are reported good in almost all sections.
Speculation in Wall street continues quiet, which is
by no means a bad sign. Prices for meats and pro
visions continue high, owing partly tq scarcity of
live stock and partly to the operations of the beef
trust; but both lines are much' quieter, with decreased
speculation in .provisions. The recent wool sales in
London were well attended and the bidding was
brisk at firm prices.
TRADE again, showed some hesitation last
week, particularly in the neighborhood of
Chicago, where the teamsters' strike assumed
grave proportions, involving many branches of busi
ness, particularly those connected directly or indi
rectly with the packing plants, such as the fresh meat
and ice trades. The coal strike, too, showed renewed
signs of spreading along the Atlantic seaboard, and
between these two great labor disturbances the week
closed with a not very promising outlook for the
near future. Other unfavorable indications were
poorer reports from the New England footwear fac
tories, many of which are now running on half time
only, with prices on the down grade and smaller
orders coming in from the South, which is unusual
at this time of the year.. Domestic hides are also
quieter, and the general feeling is that these goods
have about reached the top as far as quotations are
concerned. Leather is still held up to the recent ad
vance, but the market is not active. The textiles are
also reported inactive, with smaller business in cloth
ing and cotton goods, the exports of the latter having
fallen off considerably of late. The cotton crop is
looking very well, and the indications are for a large
yield. Iron and steel continue active, but the best
business is now in the cruder forms of the product,
the finer finished lines being in diminished demand.
But the production is still enormous, the monthly
output of pigiron exceeding 1,500,000 tons, breaking
all previous records, but in spite of this stocks are
still low, showing enormous consumption.
BUSINESS IS IRREGULAR.
'Qur contemporary says of the wine fake "there is
no law by which such enemies of the public stomach
can be reached." Perhaps President Roosevelt's
suggested remedy for trusts^ "publicity," might be
effective in dealing with such frauds. If the manu
facturer had to put his name on his 'packages ex
posure would reach the righi man and a whole in
dustry would not be subjected to suspicion by reason
of the unscrupulous action of a single dealer. . '
The issue is 1 the more important to the State .be
cause we are having so. much of that-kind of thing
to contend against. Cheap' fruits are put up in the
East with California labels, cottonseed oil is marked
California olive, oil, and some time ago the Philadel
phia Record noted that plums gathered in the North
west were dried and sold in that city under the style
of California prunes. , ' ,"
The menace to the California wine industry, con
tained in this scheme must be apparent to all. It is
not so very long ago since the sale of California wine
in Mexico was seriously hurt by the disebvery there
of certain casks of wine purporting to be pure Cali
fornia wine, but found to be heavily charged, with
salicylic acid. From that experience it is easy to
draw the conclusion that if a few unprincipled deal
ers should make use of the "wine extract" blend and
the stuff be shipped abroad under a California label
and the fraud be discovered and published the whole
legitimate wine industry of the State would suffer.
The letter is too long to be quoted in full, but the
meaning and intent of the offer made to merchants
can be understood from this passage: "One gallon
wine extract yields you 100 gallons blending wine,
alcohol free. . You have to take a barrel of 100 gal
lons capacity, put in one gallon wine extract and
fill the barrel with water, shake the barrel well,
in a few minutes you vvill^havera efearand bright
wine which will never turn cloudy. You can be sure
that your wine that you take to blend jvith our blend
ing wine never gets cloudy, and you can bring up
this wine to a grade of 6 per cent alcohol and it will
be a steady, good quality of wine that never turns
cloudy or sour. We charge you $10 per gallon, so in
this way the blending wine will cost you only 10
cents per gallon."*
THE Pacific Wine and Spirit Review gives no
tice of the presence in the city of what it
calls "an unprincipled wine faker with his
schemes for producing a substitute for .wine with
which to humbug the people and poison their stom
achs." As evidence of the justice of the charge our
contemporary publishes a circular letter sent to a
reputable wine house, and the showing is Convincing.
A WINE FAKER'S SCHEME.
. A striking illustration of the small amount of cash
needed to settle the balances of large affairs was re
cently afforded at the clearing-house in New York.
The Chatham National Bank of New York had
clearances one day amounting to $1,323,694, and yet j
when the balance was struck there was 'found due to
the bank just ten.cents.

j The British cruiser Terrible holds the
best record for expeditious coaling, hav
ing stowed 2500 tons in in nine and one
half hours, or at the rate of 263 tons an
hour. The Prince Gfeorge comes next with
208 tons, and the Majestic is a good third
with 203 tons. The two latter ships have,
however, a bunker capacity of only 1830
tons, and the work of trimming or filling
up the additional compartments in the

Naval Constructor Hobson will undoubt
edly be retired. It is alleged that he has
political aspirations and desires to repre*
sent one of the Alabama districts in
Congress. There are two points of inter
est in this Hobson case, one being the
fact that he was advanced ten numbers
for his gallant exploit in sinking the
Merrimac at Santiago on June 3, 1898. It
was clearly a duty outside the functions
of a, naval constructor, and rather those
of a line officer, and Mr. Hobson was
confident that he would be transferred to
the line. So much opposition developed,
however, to this transfer that it was
deemed expedient to retain him ln ; the
naval construction corps, and Hobson
was advanced over ten officers in that
branch, all, of whom were his seniors. He
now receives $3700 a year and has the
rank of captain, while but for the Merri
mac incident his pay would be $3200 and
his rank that of lieutenant. He has had
easy shore billets since his return from
Coventry, or China; yet he is dissatisfied,
and impaired eyesight is the official real
son given for ; his~retlrenient at a pay of
$2775. The "second point is this: that ac
cording, to section 1457, Revised Statutes,
"officers retired from active service * * *
shall be subject to the rules and, articles
for the government of the navy and to
trial by general court-martial." In the
event of Mr. Hobson's ' election to Con
gress he would be somewhat hampered
by these navy regulations, and the fear
of a court-martial would have a restrain
ing effect. He would certainly not be
able to quote poetry disparaging to a
chief of bureau 'of the Navy Department
nor to criticize or expose the faulty meth
ods of the department. Thus handicapped
his usefulness would be greatly impaired,
and naval legislation and debates would
still be carried on by persons who know
little or nothing about the subject.

inch guns at a sea target while the
ship -was running at half-speed seven hits
were scored.- The targets consisted of
rafts about 'forty-five feet in length, with
masts at each end and canvas stretched
between them. The length of the, range
was one mile, and owing to the choppy
sea the targets jumped about to such an
extent as to require exceptional skill by
the gunners to hit the targets. Other ves
sels made also a good showing, but none
came up to the Kearsarge's.

A series of progressive trials of the ar
mored cruiser Good Hope, of 14,100 tons
and 30,000 horsepower, have been highly
satisfactory and reflect great credit on the
Fairfield Company, Glasgow, builders of
the. hull and engines. The ship made a
number of rues over the measured mile
course at varying speed and on practically
the same draught of twenty-six and a
half feet, or six inches in excess of the
calculated mean draught, which increased
the displacement to nearly 14,500 tons. The
data of these runs is tabulated as follows:
The. Exmouth, a battleship of 14,000 ton?,
built -and engined by Laird Bros., Birken
head, was delivered to the Admiralty on.
May 13 and is ready for her official trials.
The keel of the Exmouth was laid August
10, 1899, and her delivery is therefore con
siderably within the contract time of
three years. Compared with contract
building in the United States, our ship
yards make no such records, as the
Maine, due one year ago," la only 89 per
cent completed, the Missouri 63 per cent
and the Ohio 57 per cent. They were t-j
be delivered in thirty-two months, dating
from October, 1S98, and yet they, have pro
gressed only 11, 9 and 14 per cent, in the
order named, since January of the present
year.
Philip Watts, the new director of naval
construction In the British navy, is said
to be at work on the designs of an
armored cruiser of 10,800 tons, 22,000 horse â¢
power and twenty-four knots speed. The
new vessel will be one knot faster than
those now under construction, and will
be speedier by a half-knot than the Ger
man liners Deutschland and Kronprinz
Wilhelmâ that is to say. in a short run
under the most favorable conditions, for
in a race across the Atlantic no naval
vessel has yet been designed or built that
can equal the performance of the express
streamers. The coal supply of the war
ship would be exhausted in less than two
days, leaving the ship unable to return to
her point of starting, 1 whereas the mer
chant steamers have coal enough left
after a 23-knot [ gait over 2800 to 3000 miles
to return at a moderate, speed to their
home port.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The French battleship Suffren, built at
Brest, is completed and represents, like all
other battleships In the French navy, one
individual type. The ship is of 12,728 tons,
410 feet in length, 70 feet beam and 27 feet
6 inches draught. She has triple-screw
engines of 16,200 horsepower, is fitted with
Niclausse boilers and is intended to steam
eighteen knots. The water line of Krupp
steel extends all around the vessel and is
oÂ» twelve-Inch maximum thickness, tap
ering to eight inches at the ends. Below
the belt Is a threeÂ»Inch armored deck, and
above the belt is another armored deck,
the space between the two decks being
used for coal. The central battery Is pro
tected by vertical armor 5.1 inches thick,
and the main turrets are 12.6 inches in
thickness- The armament is composed of
four 12-inch, ten 6.4-lnch, eight 4-inch,
twenty three-pounders, two one-pounders
and four torpedo tubes, two of which ara
above water. The coal carried on normal
draught is 820 tons; the capacity is 1150
tons coal and liquid fuel giving a calcu
lated endurance of 1000 to 1500 miles at
maximum speed and 5100 to 7000 miles at
ten knots. The estimated cost is $3,692,12:.
The Suffren does not compare favorably
with battleships of England, Germany or
the United States built during the same
period.

The Italian naval budget for 1302-03
calls for Â¦ $22,280,000 in round numbers.
The personnel consists of 1S55 officers and
25,000 enlisted men. Of the. officers 960
are of the line, 374 engineers and 219
medical; and of the enlisted force 1S,37'J
are .for sea. service and 6627 for various
duties ashore. By July 1, this year, the
Italian navy will number 50 battleships
and cruisers, 11 destroyers, 143 torpedo
boats, 3S auxiliary cruisers, 29 harbor
service vessels and 1 submarine boat. The
value of ships under construction is
placed at $8,392,000; of completed ships,
including ammunition, $107,000,000, and
other fleet material $1,151,000, making a
grand total of $116,543,000 estimated value
of the entire fleet. â¢
Scotch boiler.
The boiler* trials of the British cruisers
Hyacinth and Minerva are to be still fur
ther continued in order to determine the
relative values of the Belleville water
tube and the ordinary cylindrical Scotch
boilers in the respective ships. Thet two
vessels are to have another race to Gib
raftar and return and also a number of
competitive runs at varying speeds and
conditions over the measure mile course.
The boiler committee has been experiment
ing with these ships for more than a year
and its inability to come to any conclusion
after so many exhaustive trials seems to
indicate a final condemnation of the
three knots was calculated. Some Inter
esting facts are* to be noted from these
trials, namely the low horsepower re
quired for low speed and the enormous
power needed to develop the maximum
speed. A curve made from the trial data
proves that there is an error in the horse
power for 18.10 knots, which should be
11,250 instead of 12,108, and taking all the
other results as correct, the curve shows
that while it requires about 1780 horse
power for ten knots, the power must be
increased to about 15,000 to raise the speed
to twenty knots, and that In order to in
crease the speed half a knot above
twenty-three it would need 43,000 horse
power, or nearly one-half additional to
the 30,000, which a twenty-three-knot
speed requires. The Good Hope is fitted
with forty-three Belleville boilers, which
appear to have : done well.,
That statement seems to clear up every doubtful
point in the proceedings that led to the war. Rhodes
desired to force the war because he was as much
afraid of the foreigners who were going into the
Rand as he was pi the Boers. He desired that South
Africa should be British and he deliberately brought
on a war to accomplish his desire. He is dead, but
his plans have succeeded. It now remains for the
future to tell how permanent that success will be.
It is by no means improbable that united South
Africa may yet choose to be independent, and in the
end Rhodes' policy may lead up to the very thing
he tried to prevent.
Continuing the theme Rhodes went on to say that
whether this enterprising and dominant population
of mining men and others who would pour into the
Rand to develop its mines felt a grudge against
Great Britain or not they would at least be careful
to retain their independence. Upon that point they
would make common cause with the Boers, and they
might even in an emergency, seek the protection or
an alliance with Germany. He then added: "The
Afrikander world would gradually recognize their
leadership. So that in the end instead of a British
federal dominion you would get' a United States of
South Africa, with its capital on the Rand, and very
likely it would be ruled by a party that would be
entirely opposed to the English connection. In fact,
you would lose South Africa, and lose it by the
efforts of the English-speaking minority in the
Transvaal, who are at present. anti-British as well as
anti-Kruger."
One of the most luminous of these revelations of
the nature of Rhodes' ambitions is contributed by
his friend Sidney Low, who reports that Rhodes in
speaking to- him of the controversy with the Boers
said: "I knew that in five years there would be 250,
000 white' settlers on the Rand. In ten years there
might be half a million or more. Now that large
European population, with its enormous wealth and
industry, would inevitably become the political cen
ter of ail South Africa. If we left tilings alone the
outlanders were certain, sooner or later, to turn
out Kruger and his lot, to get possession of the
Transvaal administration and to make the republic
a modern, financial, progressive state which would
draw all South Africa after.it. But they would have
done it entirely by their own efforts. They would
owe no gratitude to England, and, indeed, they
might feel a grudge against the home" Government
for having left them in the lurch so long."
There has been much dispute as to the origin of
the war in South Africa, but that dispute may now
be ended. The death of Cecil Rhodes has resulted
in bringing to light many things revealing the plans
and . tactics of that master imperialist which would
never have been published had- he lived. Among
them are certain documents or well authenticated
statements so clearly proving that Rhodes deliber
ately precipitated the conflict that in the very hour
of his defeat old Oom Paul may be said to be vin
dicated out of the mouth of his foe.
GREAT BRITAIN had made' ready for an ex
ultant roar of joy and victory upon the offi
cial announcement, of peace. It has now
been received from Lord . Kitchener. ; The war
has closed. So far as the British are concerned
all is over but the shouting, and*it is the intention
to have the shouting attended by every form of dem
onstration that can be used to attest an imperial
triumph. There will be arches and bonfires. There
will be honors and rewards scattered by royal* hands,
and the victorious soldiers and their general return
ing from the war will be welcomed with, an enthu
siasm that will not fall short of that which stirred
old Rome when a Consul marched, in triumph up
Capitoline Hill. ;
WHAT IT WAS FOR.
What are we to make of" that? After all the re
ports from official and non-official sources concern
ing the islands, one learned Senator' 'declares the
Filipinps are a people in the. legal meaning of 'the
term and that they had an army, while another Sena
tor just as learned and representing the same polit
ical party, asserts they are only superficially a people
and their army was but "a collection of miscella
neous persons." . â¢'
When the question comes before the people this
falF there may be many who will understand it, but
they will have to understand it through their own
illumination, for the Senators have cast â¢ no light
upon either the law, the principles or the facts of
the case. * . ;
"He referred to the Filipino; army as a collection
of miscellaneous persons, who now. constituted bands
of'bandits and cutthroats." Â¦ â¢ . \
/"Hoar inquired if the inhabitants of the Philip
pines were not a people where there were millions
of men acting together, who raised an army, selected
a general, turned Spain out of all: territory except
only the city of' Manila, and who had' agreed upon a
constitution republican in form. \ Â¦ '..,-. , " , â¢
"They would be 'a people,' replied Spooner, 'if
that were true.' ' ; . , - .
"'It-is true,' said Hoar.
. " 'I deny it,' insisted Spooner. 'I deny that there
is more than superficial truth 'in it.'.
Here then is a Senator who is not in favor of hold
ing the Philippines permanently, but who is opposed
to running, away. He is not willing .to admit the
islands to statehood or the people to citizenship,
but he is' opposed to governing them by imperial
methods. That statement is just about as' tlear as
any;-' that has been made on the subject, except that
of who advocated permanent occupa
tion of the' country and permanent subjection of the
people. . * . *'
Even upon the broadest and most conspicuous
facts of the case the Senators disagree. The dis^.
patches report this .colloquy between Hoar "'and
Spooner:. Â¦ '. ::. ., - . ; . : , \ Â¦Â¦ ' '
cept his' home ties, than that this Government should
be confined to this continent. No question of im
perialism, he said, had been raised in this problem
except for party purposes." ," ' .

Dr. Barrows' Condition Is Critical.

to-night his condition is again said to be

Eight-Hour Watches for Police.
The eight-hour system in the Police De

morning at 7 o'clock, when the first watch

With a judicious use of the pruning
knife and a little more action instilled
in the second act "The Red Knlgiit,"
George H. Broadhurst's latest effort, will
0o. Despite the fact that Mr. Broadhurst
has had long experience as a writer of
successful comedies, he has partly failed
in his new play. Jt lacKs dramatic tire
and the speeches are too long and the
least bit complicated.
' The first, two acts of the production
lead one to believe that the playwrignt
has perused the pages of Anthony Hope's
"Prisoner of Zenda." William Shake
speare's "Romeo and Juliet" and Richard
Harding Davis latest serial story "Ran
son's Folly." The play has a "Kupert of
Hentzau" flavor to it. The second act is
impossible. The leading people ride onto
the stage in a coupe and are halted by
the "The Red Knight," after whom the
play takes its name. If Mr. Broadhurst
nau omitted comedy at this stage and
instilled more strenuous lines the act
would be interesting. As it is, it is stupid
and commonplace. It was suggested *y
one critic that if the horses attached to
the carriage were made to run away, the
act would be more realistic.
The next two acts are better. The lines
give the- members of the cast a splendid
opportunity to display their talents. At.
the close of the last act Mr. Neill and his
charming wife recite an epilogue that is
f gem in its way. The audience last
evening applauded it heartily.
While Mr. Xeill did some very good
work as Robert, Crown Prince of Moran
lea, the laurels go to Miss Edythe Chap
man. The latter has a congenial part as.
the Queen of Rhodoland and makes the
most of it. The rest of the cast will do
much better when they throw off their
nervousness and become more familiar
with their lines.
Mr. Broadhurst has a good play, but his
comedy efforts at times are farcical. The
production has been handsomely mounted
and notwithstanding its defects will prob
ably do a big business during the week..
This week's bill at the Orpheum is ex
ceptionally good. "Pete" Dailey and hta
clever company more than duplicatea
their hit of the opening week. "A Dress
Rehearsal," a rather clever little skit,
which is Dailey's pet vaudeville stunt,
gives himself and the rest of his com
pany, consisting of John Kearney, Ed
Garvie, Mai Lowrie and Mollie Thomp
son; plenty of opportunity to display their
v.onderful versatility. Stuart Barnes, the
popular monologist and singer, furnished
the big audience with no end of amuse
ment. The two Little Pucks pnt several
new songs into their turn this week,
which prove very catchy. Murphy and
Slater, colored singers and dancers, made
quite a hit. Lotta Gladstone, who is per
haps the peer of all women monologists
rendered her clever impersonations in her
usual fascinating style. Walter Le Roy i
and Florence Clayton appeared in a side
splitting Irish comedy, entitled "Hogan
of the Hansom." Le Roy is perhaps one
of the best Irish comedians who ever ap
peared here and his partner. Miss Clay
ton, is also exceptionally clever. Irene
Franklin, the girl with the sweet voice,
was good as usual.
At the Tivoli Opera House this even
ing the famous success, "The Toy Mak
er" will be revived with all the favorites
of the comic opera company in the cast.
On Wednesday night, "The White High
binders"' from Oakland will attend the
performance, dressed In full regalia.
Kathryn Kidder appears to-night at the
Columbia in Alexander Dumas' comedy
drama. "Francillon," adapted for the
stage by L. Du Pont Syle.
The offering at the Alcazar for this
week is Crane's well-known comedy suc
cess, "His Wife's Father." Florence
Roberts opens her season next week at
this house.
Maude Fealy will be seen to-night at
the Grand Opera House in the play en
titled "My Lady Dainty." This will be
the first time this play has been given
at popular prices.
The Central Theater will present "The
Sidewalks of New York" as its attraction
to-night and the thrilling melodrama will
be superbly mounted.
This evening marks the beginning of
the ninth week of the fun making pro
duction of "Fiddle Dee Dee" at Fischer's
Theater and the demand for seats is as
large as ever.
The new programme at the Chutes is
most attractive. A fine vaudeville show,
moving pictures and Colonel Edward
Beaupre, the tallest man on earth, are
presented.

Gertrude Lipp, residing at 8 Cohen
place, near .the corner of Ellis and Leav
enworth streets, made a determined ef
fort to commit suicide at her home early
last night. A member of the woman's
family telephoned to the Central Emer
gency Hospital and asked that a doctor
be sent at once. Steward Bertaud was
sent on the case, but when he arrived at
the house he was told that his services
were not needed. On investigation he
learned that Mrs. Lipp had tried to take
her life by inhaling illuminating gas. The
family endeavored to attribute the af
fair to carelessness, but the fact that the
tips had been removed from the gas jets
an* the gas turned on in full force shows
that the affair was premeditated.
From neighbors It was learned that Mrs.
Lipp, who is a divorced woman, had been
receiving the attentions of a young man
for some time and of late she has had
irequent quarrels with him, and becom
ing despondent tried to end her life.
While the family would not admit that
Mrs. Lipp had had a quarrel with the
young man, they were loud in their
threats that if a certain young man again
called at the house to see Mrs. Lipp he
Â¦\\ould receive dire punishment.
Dr. Nusbaum, who was afterward
called to attend the case, gave hope that
Mrs. Llpp would recover. Mrs. Lipp is
about 25 years of age and is quite pre
possessing. .; . '

ON next Wednesday evening *at the
Alhambra Theater an entertain
ment will be given in aid of the
fund for liquidating the debt oÂ£
the new church of the Holy Re
deemer. â¢ *
The performance promises to be one of
the best ever given in this city, the pro
gramme being replete with good acts.
The first part will be in the hands of the
members of the Olympic Club. Exhibi
tions of refined athletics will be given,
including fencing, acrobatic feats, club
swinging and wrestling. #
The second part will be a great vaude
ville show. Harry Wood Brown, the ten
or, who has just returned to this city
after filing a successful engagement in
New York, will sing some selections that
are the latest hits -in Gotham. Lillian J.
Wilson and the famous Elks' quartet will
also sing. Miss Nelly Waters will give
her musical sleighbell act and Charles
Reynolds, the clever sleight-of-hand man
and shadow artist, is also down on the
programme. The performance will close
with that laughable comedy, "A Lovely
Party," that was recently produced at
the Orpheum and was such' a great suc
cess. Ida Lee Davis and Alfred I. Mc-
Klnnon will appear In this sketch and
those who hav6 seen the rehearsals say
that they are very clever in the act.
Tickets are only 50 cents. Reserved
seats* can be procured at the Alhambra
Theater on Wednesday afternoon, at the
box office, or by calling at the parochial
residence, 116 Diamond street, any time
before the performance.
The pastor of Holy Redeemer Church,
the Rev. Father McQualde, has hosts of
friends and it is expected that the theater
will be crowded by those who wish to see
the debt of his new edifice wiped out.
Mrs. W. H. Hoburg Is chairman of the
reception committee for the entertain
ment.

DRUGS v
In "Herpicide," the New Scientific
and Successful Dandruff Treatment.
Have you dandruff? Then you have a
contagious parasite disease, unpleasant,
unhealthy and one that will eventually
lesd to baldness. To cure it you must
destroy the parasite that eats at the root
of the hair. The only preparation for
destroying these germs is Newbro's Her-
picide. Charles Klein of Laramie, Wyo.,
saya: "Herpicide allayed the Itching,
cured the dandruff and stopped my hair
falling out; and it is bringing a new crop
of hair." Herpicide is free from grease
or 'dangerous drugs, and makes hair
gloss}' and soft as silk. One bottle will
convince you of its merits.

The American ship Shenandoah. the finest
wooden four-master afloat, is preparing for her
/ departure for Â»w York on the 11th inst. Cap
tain 'E. A. Watts is now signing his crew or
twentyeight men, and he hopes to have hiÂ«
full complement of hands at the end of the
Â¦week. The Shcnandoah's cargo is being rapidly
stowed and tt consists of everything from a
package of pins to coils of cables formerly
used by the Market street railway system,
which will be used In strengthening the foun
dations of New York skyscrapers. Captain and
MxÂ«. Watts received many visitors yesterday
and showed them the beauties of their vessel.
The wind blew a gale yesterday, the result
being a very rough bar. which delayed vessels
oom-iderably. The British ship Thlstleback.
forty-five days *Â»-ut from Santa Rosalia was
sighted late in the afternoon, several miles out.
but her entrance into the harbor was delayed
by reason of the ro-jghness: Her master con
cluded to wait offshore for orders before ven
turing in. and she is not likely to enter the
stream before this morning.
Bar Proves to Be Bough.
The Tweedsdale sailed from Haiphong last
November in ballast and in passing Java Head
asked to be reported. The voyage across the
Pacific was a series of calms and light winds,
which accounted for her long passage. The
middle of April found her in the South seai
and short of provisions. In the hope of replen
ishing her stores they had stopped at Pitcairn
island, bat were only able ta get sweet pota
toes, and It being Sunday were obliged to dig
them .themselves. Since leaving Pitcairn Isl
and they had grown very tired of sweet pota
toes. With at least fifty days ahead of them
before reaching Taeoma and being in the dol
drums, the passage to the nearest port. Hono
lulu, promising to be as long, the outlook was
gloomy for poor Jack on the morning of May
Â» -when the Australia was sighted. Verily Fri
day was a lucky day for them and never
again will they fear the day. but will ever re
member "the little cherub that fits up aloft
and looks out for poor Jack" as their guidin?
angel, i
The boat's crew lookied dejected and
apathetic, but the Â£iÂ£ht of fresh beef and po
tatoes being low-red into their boat evoked
smile* that were good to look upon. In a half
hour they were away again, carrying a gen
erous load of flour, biscuits, sugar and pota
toeii and & couple of hundred pounds of frozen
beef, amounting to about two tons of good
American foodstuffs for ye ancient British
mariners with "lean and hungry looks," and
r.ot an albatross in sight.
In a few minutes the boat was alongside and
tlie mate crawled up the Jacob's latter and
made the modest request for food, and upon
being assured that the larder was in robust
condition, presented a letter from Captain
Jones of the Tweesdale asking for provisions.
FUBKTSHED WITH FOOD.
After a short struggle with the lee quarter
boat the sailors were pulling for the long-
Jiopfd for relief ship, which luckily was pre
pared to fit out a fleet witb the staples of the
earth if neces?ary.
This put a different face on the situation.
Britons were hungry and had to be fed. so the
order "hard a starboard" being given, around
swung U<e Australia, and as .-he ranged along
side the Tweededale. which had in the mean
while hauled up th? cross jaclc -and backed the
train yard, the question was asked: "Are you
in need of provisions?" On receiving an an
eww in the affirmative the order, was given,
"Send your' boat alongside."
At daybreak Â«. full-rigged ship was sighted
off thÂ° port bow. flying signals of distress,
xvhi.-h vcssf-1 proved to be th? Tweedsdale of
Glasgow. 150 days out from Haiphong. Gulf of
Tonqufn. China, and hound to Taeoma. On
i">aring the ship, which was under full sail,
with a light breeze blowing, the three-flag sig

terpreted by th~ pew International tlgnal book,

but as the Australia did not know Just what
kind Â«if ro-operation was neeiiod. the old book.

ari entire family was turned out of house
and home in Fruitvale to-night. Otis
Brown, aged 6, grandson of J. "W. Brown,
who lives on Cherry avenue, tried to form
a train at his grandfather's home. He set
a number of ordinary chairs up' for
coaches and a rocking*) chair for a locomo
tive, and then set his train in motion by
rocking the head chair. This rocking up
set an oil heater and this set nre to the
..house..; : ' Â¦". .â¢." - Â¦, /
' .The family escaped with much trouble,
but the house with all of its contents was
destroyed, the place being beyond- the city
limits of Oakland and no fire apparatus
being available. Mr. Brown had $150 in
gold in the house at. the time of the fire
and this was found later by Deputy Sher
iff Fred Jordan, melted into a nugget of
gold. - â¢ . -
The insurance was $700. but the loss will
be greatly in excess of that.

FRESNO, June 1.â At a meeting of tne

held in this city last night twenty pai.l
"call men" were added to the local fire
department. The step had been under

one, the only paid men being the en

forty applicants for the positions. The
selections were made so as to divide tho
department equally between members of

DEATH OF A WITNESS
AGAINST MRS. BOTKIN
Cfchn B. Pennington, the Father of
Her Alleged Victim, Dies in
Delaware.
DOVER, Del., June 1.â Former Attorney
General John B. Pennington, aged 77
years, the oldest lawyer in Delaware, died
to-night in his rooms in the Capitol Hotel.
Aside from his prominence in the law and
statecraft Pennington for nearly a year
was . conspicuous in the public eye over
the entire country because of his connec
tion with the famous murder case of Mrs.
Botkln, convicted and sentenced to life
Imprisonment in California for the mur
der of his two daughters, Mrs. John P.'
Dunning and Mrs. Joshua D. Deane, the
two prominent Dover young women who
were killed by a box of poisoned candy.
The tragedy so shocked the father an-J
mother that Mrs. Pennington died shortly
afterward. . Â¦ . â¢ ?
Pennington retired from the practice of
law and gradually wasted away until
death came to-night. His testimony was
believed to be vital in the chain of cir
cumstantial evidence against Mrs. Bot
kin, and in her attorneys' recent efforts to
secure a new trial for the prisoner Pen
nington believed they were only frittering
away the time until death should strike
him down that they might then Becure
the . Californian's release. The authori
ties, however, claim that the case against
Mrs. Botkln is still fatal.
Pennington after practicing civil en
gineering was admitted, to the bar in 1864.
and was subsequently Legislator, Attor
ney General and Congressman. Â¦

SACRAMENTO. June l.-War has been
declared by the newspapers of Sacramen

This fair was almost exclusively in the
hands of young people, and the children's
booth was the largest in the hall. Here
dozens of little ones labored for the bene
fit of the church, and very successful
work they did. This booth was under the
gtneral care of Miss Rose A. Gallagher.
A considerable sum has been netted by
this event, but the exact amount will not
be computed until the end of the week.
The attendance has been very good, but
to-morrow night is expected to eclipse
all other evenings because of the an
nouncements to be made and the grand
wind-up of the affair.
It is already known that Clara Boland
has won the gold ring offered for the
mest successful worker connected witn
the children's booth, but the other little
prize-winners are as yet undetermined.

"The most severe test I know of was
tvhen my husband was down with gas*
trie typhoid fever. His stomach would
retain nothing: we tried milk and vari-
ous other drinks. Everything we put
Into his stomach would come up in less
tl an three minutes. After the third day
of this kind of work I concluded to give
him some Postum Coffee. He drank It
and relished it and retained It. and for
four weeks he lived on Postum and:nota-
Jng elf-e to speak oL You can depend
t>i:-on it that Postum gained some good
friends, for Husband ; would have died if
it had, not been for the nourishment nf-
ferded by Postum Coffee." Name given
by Pcstum Co., Battle Creek, lllch.
"I used to have stomach trouble and
every time I drank a cup of ordinary
coffee suffered the greatest distress. My
troubles left when I left off coffee and
began using Postum.
Speaking of Postum Food Coffee, a
lady in Toledo, O., says: "For over five
yea re now 1 have used Postum Coffee en-
tirely In place of the ordinary coffee or
tea.
It makes rather solid friends of people
Â¦when they discover a liquid food that
xvil! save life in extreme cases of need.
Then Postum Saved Him.

- The man who gets to "the club"' ,. so
often does not know whether to shake
hands with himself or feel hurt. Since
hercan ride to his home in the suburbs
now at any hour of the morning, he is
enabled to save the dollar paid for a
room, when he heretofore "accidentally"
missed his last car, but the inconvenient
part of it is that he has to drop that old
excuse that he missed, the last car. Those
living in the Potrero and Presidio dis
tricts can still run the old bluff , however,
as the night service does not as yet in
clude the lines covering those portions of
the city. Satisfaction is heard, particu
larly from the workingman, who labors
till early morning and is saved the incon
venience of walking several miles to get
to bed. "Owl" cars are now run on the
Mission and Kearny, the Eddy and the
Ellis and -O'Farrell streef lines. After 1

Following the , sixteen white forms of
the children . came seventy-eight laymen
with lighted candles In hand, followed
closely by twenty acolytes, also bearing
candles. Then slowly marched thirteen
priests in vested chasuble, and incense
bearers followed, immediately preceding
Father Frieden, who under a beautiful
and elaborate canopy reverently bore the
blessed sacrament. In the rear of the sa
cred procession c^ime about fifty of tho
officers of the Ladles' Sodality, each rev
erently carrying a lighted candle.
The procession was ended, the benedic
tion, was delivered by the celebrant and
the. vast congregation slowly dispersed,
many picking up as sacred- souvenirs the
roses that had covered the passage of the
processionists.- , . â¢ "
Immediately after vespers-, the proces
sion was formed. and the blessed sacra
ment was carried triumphantly, along the
aisles and around the church to tho
grand strains of the "Pange Lingua" by
the immense combined choir of the church
and the i Ladles' SodalUy. Heading the
procession were a nurrroer 4 of little girls
dressed in Â¦white,- arid- from dainty baskets
they showered the path of the procession
ists with. roses. Then, as the light-blazed
altar was left by the clergy, the. great
organ and the voices-swelled forth thrill
ing music. .
At St. Ignatius Church yesterday morn-
Ing the solemnity of Corpus Chrlstl was
celebrated with high mass, at which thÂ«
Rev. Father Allen was celebrant, the Rev.
Joseph -Hickey deacon and Patrick Ryan
sub-deacon.' The sermon was preached by
the Rev. Father John Sardi. St. Ignatius
was largely attended. There was not a
vacant seat in the great edifice through
out the ceremony.- â¢
The evening service was most imposing
and consisted of vespers with solemn
"Magnificat" by -the choir. The Very Rev.
John P. Frieden was ; celebrant, the Rev.
Father George Butler was deacon and
Henry R. Fleurens, S...J., was sub-deacon.
"I do not ask my people who come to
hear me preach to vote for this man or
that, but I do demand that they- should
have lofty ideas and righteous thoughts."
Dr. Harper spoke of the- danger of for
eign immigration, but said if they could
be touched with the same principles that
were In our forefathers' hearts they, too,
could be made good patriots, concluding
with the statement: "The church has a
wonderful duty to performâ It is the
Christianizing of such a people, for right
eousness exalteth a nation.".
"President Roosevelt at Arlington last
Friday said, 'There is no such thing as
liberty and freedom where there is not
strength and wisdom.' Â¦ K'^^
The speaker quoted the skeptic, Hume,
who said, 'A people without religion were
a little better than brutes." .
Macaulay once said that "Whoever does
anything to depreciate Christianity is
guilty of high treason against humanity."
Dr. Harper said: "I will go farther than
that. I will say that no man can be a
good patriot if he depreciates the Chris
tianity of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
"The man. who huzzas the loudest is not
necessarily the greatest patriot- The
truest patriot is the man who withstands
popular clamor, who withstands Senates
and opposes even the King. Men wno
have been burned at the stake as heretics
and executed as traitors .have often been
the truest patriots. The true patriot rises
above partisan strife, because he foresees
the destiny of the -people. The. highest
patriotism seeks to make its Government
the noblest; anything below that ceases to
be true patriotism.
"The religious beliefs of the people are
what Governments are built on, neither
the army nor the' navy. nor the President
make these great United States, but the
hearts and beliefs of the people go to
make the American Government. The
state is the reflex of the church. The al
tar shapes the throne."
Dr. Harper said he belonged to a de
nomination whose constitutions did not
believe that the church should dictate to
the laity, but that the church should aid
by giving the people loftier ideas. Con
tinuing, he said: Â¦Â¦ --- â¢ - r - . .
"Rousseau was right when he said,
'Never was a state founded that did not
have religion foT its basis,' and since the
time of tne Roman Empire under Rome
lus, down to Charlemagne, no Govern
ment functions had ever been executed
without some appeal to the deities.
"Plutarch knew, when he wrote 'there
never was a kingdom built of atheists.'
and LÂ»ord Ersklne, the great jurist, knew
when he said, .'The world cannot be kept
together without morals.' and morality
cannot be maintained without religion."
The Rev." Dr. Harper preached a strong
sermon last night at the Centenary Meth
odist Episcopal Church, Bush street, be
tween Gough and Octavia. He spoke on
patriotism and the necessity of its having
religious surroundings. In part he said:

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOBERS
. MEET IN NUMBERS
Conway Is known to have cashed quite
a. number of bail orders on drunk charges
In saloons in the vicinity of the Hall of
Justice. SoÂ»ne of these were indorsed in
the name of the person in whose favor
they were drawn, and some were not.- If
It is found that the indorsement on the
orders were forged it will present a new
and decidedly serious addition to the
charges. â¢
"I propose." said Captain Martin, "to
begin at the initial point of this case. ai;d
for that reason I have detailed Detectives
Wren and Dinan to try to locate the per
sons whose bail is alleged to have been
forfeited and afterward drawn from the
treasury by Conway and the case entered
on the docket as dismissed. If we can
find these people and ascertain that thev
did not get their bail money we shall
make a strong case against the suspected
clerk."
Conway appeared unconcerned regard
ing the latest disclosures of his manner
of conducting the office he holds, and
early this morning said he had nothing
to fear. He said he stood by his records
and defied any one to find anything ir
regular about them. When told that dis
crepancies had been discovered between
his books and the memorandum kept by
Judge Mogan he said he was not account
able for Mogan's memorandum. His en
tries, he said, were the records of the
court, and were not to be attacked by
private memoranda. Late last night a
report gained currency that Conway had
disappeared. He heard of it in some way
and came down to the Hall of Justice to
set at rest the rumors of his flight.
Captain of Detectives Martin proposes
to do whatever is in his power to ascer
tain if the charges of bail "kiting" on the
part of Convray are well founded.
CONWAY UNCONCERNED.
I have requested Bond Clerk Greeley to make
me out a list of all cases vhich have been
appealed from the Police Courts, so that I
may investigate and find out if the bail money
in these cases has been tampered with.
If there has been any further crooked work
In connection with bail money in Judge Mo
pan's court, we will find out to-day. I do not
ihir.k that any very large amount has gone
astray
When the bail money is exonerated the man
who put it up must, before he can regain it,
6ecure an order from the clerk of court. This
order must be sigrned by the Judge I cannot
pee how it is possible for there to be any
fraud in connection with bail money, unless the
Judge is negligent in signing orders. In the
Treasurer's office we personally seldom know
the men who present the orders for the return
of the bail money and we must pay this money
to any one to whom the Judge gives an order
properly signed.
Â¦When bail is paid into the treasury it is
charged to the account of the man who puts
it up. If the man fails to appear in court at
the proper time and his bail money is de
clared forfeited, the clerk of the court in
which the man's case was heard makes out an
order for the money payable to the County
Clerk. This money does not leave the treas
ury. The County Clerk simply sends in the
order for the money and it is transferred to
Ida account.
Deputy Treasurer Charles 3. Perkins
when seen last night in regard to the
latest developments in the Conway bail
scandal gave the following account of the
process that must be observed before bail
money can be withdrawn from the treas
ury:
WITHDRAWAL OF MONEY.
The Judge considered that enough had
been shown to warrant an investigation,
and he laid the matter before Captain
Martin, giving him a list of the cases re
ferred to. The captain detailed Detectives
Dinan and Wren on the case, with instruc
tions to make an investigation and report.
If the bail money in these cases has
been withdrawn from the treasury after
being declared forfeited, then the person
withdrawing it has been guilty of falsify
ing the public records and obtaining
money by false pretenses.
Edward Swift was arrested May 13 for
being drunk and on May 16 the Judge de
clared the bail of $5 forfeited, but the
court record shows no entry at all on that
date for Swift's case.
Jack Riordan and Thomas Dowell were
arrested May 15 for being drunk and each
deposited $5 cash bail for his release. They
failed to appear in court and on May 17
the Judge declared the bail in each case
forfeited. The court record has each case
marked "dismissed."
L. T. Walkman n was arrested May 13
for disturbing the peace and carrying a
concealed weapon, rie deposited $15 cash
bail for his release. He failed to make
his appearance in court and on May 16 the
Judge declared his bail forfeited and so
marked it in his docket. The court record
has the two cases marked "dismissed."
ASBEST OF WALKMAKN.
Yesterday afternoon in a few minutes
several discrepancies were discovered be
tween the Judge's dockets and the court
records, which are in the custody of Ser
geant Charles McDonald.
If a man arrested for a minor offense,
such as drunkenness or disturbing the
peace, puts up bail for his release and
docs not appear in court the Judge de
clares his bail forfeited loud enough so
that the clerk and all in court can hear
him. The Judge records in his docket
â¢'bail forfeited," and the court- record
Â«hould bear the same disposition. If,
however, the court record should state
that the case was "dismissed." then the
ball could be withdrawn from the City
Treasurer.
A new feature in the system of "kiting"
bail money was discovered yesterday by
a cursory examination of Judge Mogan's
dockets, which are kept by the Judge him
self as a record of the disposition of all
cases each day in his court, and the
court records kept by Frederick B. Con
way, clerk of the court. The dockets and
the court records should correspond, but
in several instances where bail money
was deposited there is a discrepancy.
Cossmann went to 389 Geary street last
Friday and engaged a room, telling the
landlady that he was a "captain" at the
Palace Hotel. He offered her a check in
payment of his room rent and she took it
to her grocer, who refused to accept it.
Then, in his desperation, Cossmann broke
into King's' room and stole the clothes
and shoes, pawning them so that he could
get money to try his luck at poker, but
the cards never turned his way.
When searched at the City Prison a
large number of checks drawn on differ
ent banks and private firms, which he had
written out himself in different names,
were found in Cossmann's pockets.
Cossmann Had been a waiter at the Pal
ace Hotel tor two years up to last March,
when he retired, after saving about $500.
He desired to increase his wealth, and
with that object in view began piaying
polier at the Cafe Royal. His luck was
intermittent, but his losses greatly ex
ceeded his winnings till he found himself
penniless. He pawned everything he was
possessed of excepting the clothes he wore
and lost the money at poker. At these
times he gave his address as 073 Howard
street.
Jatob Cossmann, a waiter, 21 years of
age, was arrested yesterday afternoon by
Detectives Ryan and O'Dea and booked at
the City Prison on a charge of burglary.
Cossmann was very penitent and wept
copiously while the officers were search
ing and booking him. The charge against
him is for breaking into the room of T.
R. King, 389 Geary street, Saturday morn
ing ana stealing a suit of clothes valued
at $50 and a pair of shoes. He pawned
the suit at the Kxcelsior Loan Oinee on
