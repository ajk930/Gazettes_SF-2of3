ST. KITTS, B.W. I.. May 15.â By _ those who have arrived here
'." from Martinique' it; is said that the dumb animals were wiser than
man. Mont Pelee long gave warning of the storm of fire which it
was storing up to hurl upon the island. Residents of St. Pierre saw and
heard the warnings and they refused to heed them. They remained, and
the'danger which had long confronted them. brought death to 30,000.

KITTS, B. W. L, May 15 âFrom an officer of the steamer So-

still in eruption. Lava flows in broad streams down the sides of
the volcano. The entire island of Martinique continues in a. state .of
panic. In St. Pierre the desolation is appalling. Bodies are being burned
in a great pyre, upon which kerosene is steadily sprayed. In spite of this
it will be weeks before the place can be cleared of the debris.

morning with an account of the St.
Pierre ' disaster, telegraphed to him by a
frtend from Fort de France, Martinique,
under date of yesterday, by way of the
island of Malta. The account, which does
not differ very, materially from that al
ready told, is as follows:
"It is a melancholy and almost humili
ating thing that the site of St. Pierre has
to be guarded by the military, for nu
merous pirates from the neighboring Isl
ands were preparing to come and lay
bands on anything "of value."

AND THE FARMING LANDS IN CENTRAL SECTIONS

THE fertile fields and bountiful orchards of the central part of the State will not suiter the loss
of a vestige of their reputation for fecundity this year. Reports gathered from all the farming
and fruii-grozving localities indicate that the promise of a rich harvest is greater, if anything, than
it has been in previous seasons. Here, as in other portions of California, the demand for an unusual
amount of labor is certain to be made. Already there have been futile requests for assistance in
some sections where the fruit requires the earliest possible attention.

of { peaches/ and the . same may > be said
of prunes. .Last year the prune crop was
short on account of the fruit falling from

FIND IT NECESSARY
TO THIN OUT FRUIT
Fruits of all kinds give promise of a
large yield. Fruit is not grown very ex
tensively here, and a good portion of the
crop Is used locally. The beet crop will
be very large on account of plenty of ir
rigation. It will be about twice that of
last year.
The potatoes that have already been
planted are doing nicely, but most of the
?l op V'iS 01 /? 1 P lante<J - About four times
the yield of last year is expected; on ac
count of the larger acreage and more
favorable conditions.
SOLEDAD, May 15.â The crop prospects
In the vicinity of Soledad are not very
, ; favorable compared with last season.
About one-half crop of barley, is expected
which will be about 4000 tons. Wheat will
be an average, or about 2000 tons. The
wheat crop has held out against the dry
spell better than the barley, as most of
the -wheat ..was . aown in the. uplands and
the foothills and the barley in adobe land,
which drya out sooner. With one-half
inch, of -rain in the next week or ten days
crops would improve to about two-thirds
of an average yield.
Continued cool weather has prevented a
very rapid growth of hops, but thevout
look !s good for a full crop. The -hop
yards have been cultivated, poled and
twined and the vines are now being
trained. There is increased activity In
the development of Mendocino's lumber
Interests. New mills are being â¢ put in.
ooth on the coast and in the woods near
Willlts. Lumber is now coming Â» down
over the Willits extension of theiCali
fcrnia Northwestern Railway. Arrange
ments are being made for a big season
run in the tan bark industry.
UKIAH, May 15.â As a while/conditions
ln Mendocino County are much more
favorable than they were at this time
last year. While the loss of lambs on the
ranges was greater than last year, owing
to continued rains in lambing time, the
same rains insured better pasturage. Fre
quent spring rains have kept the. feed
green and growing fruit of , all -.kinds
promises well, while at an even, date last
year practically all fruit except apples
had been killed by frost. Grain and hav
crops arc good and there will be an aver
age yield. In some of the northern val
leys; planting was somewhat retarded by
rain. ,
II OLLISTER, May 15.â The scarcity of.
|â¢J | rains in the. first part of the season'
had a disastrous effect on the early
sown grain, but the spring rains have
been of great benefit to the late : graln,'.
and the prospect at ; the present time in
very favorable for an average yield in the
valleys, while in the! higher altitudes and
in the southern, end.' of the county, not
more than 'a half-crop will be harvested.;
Green feed is abundant and. stock of all
kinds is. in splendid condition. : Hay cut
ting has commenced, and though the yield
will fall considerably short, of 'last year,
it will be of excellent quality.' : â¢-
In the San Juan Valley preparations are
being made for a large, beet crop, ; thq
acreage for . that purpose .exceeding ,any

by the rain was done to strawberries. The

NEVADA CITY, May 15.â Unless there
be unusually heavy frosts within the
next few weeks, Nevada County's
yield of fruits and cereals this season will
be far in excess of that of last year. The
present storm, during which nearly an
inch of rain has fallen already, was glad

the nick of time and insures good crops.
The outlook for ell kinds of fruit is also
encouraging, notwithstanding that in
some sections more or less damage was
done by early frosts. In and 'about Ne

Jj tion of ..Â¦:37 of an inch of rain last

to 5.33 ..inches, as against 4.94 inches
at this date last season. The prospect
for cereal crops is much better than last
year, and the rain of last night gives as
surance that all but the late-sown grain
will give an average yield. With the ex
ception of prunes the fruit -crop will be
excellent. There wero no severe frosts,
but the trees are not sufficiently laden
to require thinning. The prune yield will
be less than last year. The- late rains
have: greatly strengthened the feed on

MODESTO, May 15.-The prospects for
a heavy yield of grain in Stanislaus
'County are excellent. The rainfall of
yesterday amounted to .75 of an Inch in
sonie: parts, while the whole county re
ceived a thorough soaking. In an inter
view Garrison Turner, president of the
Grange Company* of Modesto, said;
. "Yesterday s rainfall will do great good
to the wheat fields of the county. - The
yield throughout will be increased 10 per
cent. The rain has made the prospect ex
cellent for a good average crop in the
whole county. The late grain has re
ceived the most good. The early grain
has . not been harmed, but,' on- the con
trary, the rain has helped it greatly.
Taken all in all, the generous precipita
tion that, has just visited us was a splen

dollars to the grain growers of Stanislaus
County."
MARYSVILLE. May 16.â The rainfall
of Tuesday, amounting to .54 of an
Inch, was very beneficial to growing
fruit and grain. The precipitation for the
season is 20.43 inches, against 23.78 inches
for the same date last season. All Indi
cations at this time point to the largest
yield of grain that this section of North
ern California has produced for many
years. Wheat is looking splendid and
barley Is fast heading out and taking on
the golden color. Haying has commenced
in some districts and yield and quality
are reported as first class. Orchardists
are very busy thinning peaches and pears
and the crop will far exceed the one of
1901. while the fruit will b# of larger size.
The absence of late frost Insures the
largest almond crop yet produced in this
section. Strawberries and cherries are
coming in freely now and large shipments
are made daily. Managers of the Marys

ing large crews of men, making ready for
the opening run, which will be on apri
cots. This fruit is reported much larger
and in excess of last year's crop. Grow
ers of Thompson seedless grapes will have
full crop this season. In fact, every kind
of fruit and cereal produced In this sec
tion shows a bountiful yield and excellent
quality. Farmers, orchardists and trades
men in the vicinity of MarysviHe are busy

taken as a whole the yield was never so
tremendous. The weather conditions this
year have been perfect. While late rains
may have Injured a hundred boxes of
cherries, they added twice that quantity
in larger fruit. The crop is three weeks
later than last year's. In 1901, 837 cars
of green fruit were shipped East, and
something over 200 carloads of dried fruit.
A -conservative estimate for this year
gives 1200 carloads of green and nearly
400carloads of dried fruit.
Prominent growers say that, as com
pared with last year, the present out
look for, the various yields is as follows:
Apricots, four times as great; plums. 100
per cent more; grapes and peaches, 60
per cent more: French prunes, five times

and the showers of to-day brought the
total precipitation past fifty-one inches.
The Anderson and Happy Valley orchard
ists I have but one concern. It is â¢ that in
their eagerness to waste nothing they may
not thin their prune, pear and peach. crops
sufficiently and have their trees broken
down by an overweight of fruit.
The prospects are for a most excellent
season of Bartlett pears. Those grown
in Shasta County are pronounced the
finest In the State. The canners find more
sugar in them. than in any other. Pears
will be so abundant that considerable
quantities may be dried.. Good prices are
expected. The prune growers, who. have
disposed of every pound of the old. crop,
e ?Pect to market 2500 tons, the. heaviest
yield . In a decade. Frost is no longer
feared. Peach trees thrive as- .well. The
wheat, barley and oat crops of Churn
Creek Bottom, Happy Valley, Burney Val

The meadow hay districts in the hills are
luxuriant. The ranges were never better.
This will be a record crop year in Shasta.
Grain of all kinds will turn out far bet
ter than an average crop. Barley will
prove Â¦ especially heavy, and this year
there is a much larger acreage than for
several years past.
In view of the abundant crops to be
gathered, the farmers and fruit men have
organized to advertise for outside laborers
to come here to work during the fruit and
grain harvest. It is estimated that from
2000 to 3000 more laborers than those now
here will be needed. >
peaches, and the most conservative esti
mates are that this acreage will produce
6G00 1 tcns of fruit. The estimates are that
the many hundreds of acres of Crawford
peach trees will produce an average of
six and a half tons to tbe acre. Fifteen
thousand acres of prune trees in this vi
cinity will produce 3750 tons of dried fruit,
which is better than a half crop. Almond
trees are loaded with nuts and will yield
an enormous crop. Many entire crops
have already been sold at 10% cents. The
yield of Bartlett pears and cherries will
be abundant. Apricots will yield about a
half crop. Summarized, the total truit
output will be much better than last
year.
The James Feeley Canning Company is
preparing for the largest pack this year
in its* history. An accurate idea of the
magnitude of Tehama County's fruit in
terests may be gained from the statement
that the present prospects indicate that
fitjit men and orchardists will receive
$2,000,000 more for their fruit this year
than they did last year. A heavy crop
of grain of all kinds is selling at a high
figure and tire county is in a highly pros
perous condition.
Tehama County took the first premiujn
at the World's Fair at Chicago for its
magnificent apples and this year's crop
will be a splendid one. Tehama is the
second county In the State in the pro
duction of peaches and this year's crop
will excel that of several years past.
Last year there was hardly any fruit ex

any time since they -tiave been grown In
this section. About 18,000 acres axe under
cultivation. The campaign at the Oxnard
factory will be quite extended. The grain
crop will be light, owing: to the dry

to vegetables, there are very large crops
of cabbages, potatoes and other varieties,

been an exceptional demand for cabbage
from outside points, and shipments of
these have been very large. Potatoes are
commanding a good; figure and there will
be no scarcity of the crop.
"As to fruits, it may be said that the.
only trouble now feared is an overproduc

permit the fruits to mature properly. It
is thought that the California Fruit Dis

be larger than last year to i the extent
that the trees are older and more of them
are coining into bearing.
NAPA, .May 15.â Encouraging reports
have been received from orchardists
and farmers during the past ten days
as to the prospects of the fruit and grain
crops for the season of 1902. Everything
lcoks favorable and without doubt there
will be a heavier yield this year than last
year. Nearly thirty-five Inches of rain
has fallen during the past winter, and
vegetation has thrived in all sections ad
jacent to Napa. The country hereabouts
i:ever looked better. If good weather con
tinues there will be an average crop of
fruit in all orchards. There will be a
large crop of peaches and pears, all of
excellent quality. Peach trees of^ the
Alexander, Hale's Early and Crawford
varieties are heavily laden. The prune
crop will be about a. one-third yield./ 7 It
will be much lighter than usual. This
cannot be. accounted for, especially when
all conditions seemingly, have been most
favorable. The cherry crop will be some
what light. Royal Annes are very scarce
but there will be a good yield of Black
Republicans, Tartarians and other varie
ties. Apples, apricots and plums will
yield pretty well.
NAPA VALLEY'S YIELD
ABOVE THE AVERAGE
TREES ARE BURDENED
IN SOUTHERN FIELDS
The fruit outlook is very satisfactory.
Everythingis two full weeks behind last
season. Cherries will be about the same,
as last yearâ a medium crop. Apricots
are 80 to 90 per cent of last year but near
ly an average crop, j A full yield of
peaches Js assured and the prune crop
is large, nearly 40 per cent- better than
last year. Only one-half a crop of early
almonds Is expected but a full crop of
the ' late varieties. . Grain and hay are
looking well and with fair weather a
heavy crop of hay will be cut this and
next week. Early vegetables are gone.
They were plentiful and brought a good
price. Farmers . and - orchardists are jubi
lant over tha prospects. - â¢"" Â¦â¢-.Â¦
NILES, May 15.â Half an Inch of recent
rain has been of immense value to
vegetables and fruit and has done lit'
tie or no damage to grain. The total fall
is nearly. five inches. less < than last year,
but it came at an opportune time.
RAIN FALLS IN TIME
TO HELP A HARVEST
Cold rains following the warm weather
early in the season caused a partial fail
ure in apricots, but the yield promises
fairly. Peaches promise an average crop.
Apples, pears and small fruits show bet
ter prospects than usual. So far the wal
nut prospect Is good, with a big addition
al acreage coming into bearing. Grain
and hay will be plentiful, but without
more rain the alfalfa yield will be lighter
than usual.
SANTA ANA, May 15.â The present
prospects for the Orange County
grain crop are not better than last
year. San Joaquin ranch barley will av
erage half a crop. Wheat will yield only
a quarter of a crop. Four thousand acres
of lima beans promise well. Ten thou
sand acres farther south have a good
crop of barley. In the northern part of
the county the grain-prospects are good.
At Newport, Balsa, Westminster and
Garden Grove, wheat and barley are very
light. A big- acreage in beets at Los
Alamitos, Buena Park, Garden Grove and
Balsa is looking well and thinning is
veil under way. Celery plants are well
grown in seed beds and preparations are
being made to plant 2000 acres In celery
this season.
GRAIN IN THE SOUTH
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL
PASO ROBLES, May 15.â The crops In
this vicinity are in "excellent condi
tion and are not suffering for moist
ure. The late sown grain Is not looking
as well as that sown on^summer fallow
land. The prospects at present are that
there will be an abundant harvest of fruit
and- cereals.
NeaMy all the grain sown this season
is wheat, there being very little barley
raised in this section. A conservative es
t'.mate of the wheat reserved at the flour
n.ill and warehouses in this place last
season places the amount at 512.000 cent
als. The crops this season promise a
greater yield to the acreage sown, but
there is a third less 'acreage in than there
was last season. A rough estimate places
the probable wheat yield at 400,000 centals.
The estimated yield per acre is from
twenty to twenty-seven centals.
The grain fields will contribute their
share ofi prosperity. There will be an
enormous yield. Haying began three
,weeks ago. The late rain has spoiled
some of it, but there will be plenty. This
will be a record breaking season for Sul
sun. The fruit packing and shipping
firms are preparing for heavier traffic
than ever before and orders for dried
fruits arc already, registered to the amount
of thousands of boxes. It Is probable a
large percentage of the crop will be dried
but .this depends largely upon conditions
elsewhere. The organization of the Cali
fornia Fruit Distributors is expected to
have a beneficial effect upon the Eastern
markets.
SUISUN, May 13.â Crop prospects of every
kind never looked better in the vicinity
of Suisun than they do at present.
The heavy rain of Tuesday did no harm to
speak of. A few early cherries were
spoiled. With the exception of almonds,
the orchards will yield full crops of all
varieties. Some varieties of almonds are
light and others are normal. While in some
orchards there will be good crops of all
varieties. Cherries are a heavy crop and
carload shipments will begin this week.
They are at least two weeks later than
normally. Shipping plums are a big crop
and in places trees are breaking under
their loads. Prunes, pears, apricots and
peaches are normal. The problem, of se
curing sufficient help for harvesting the
fruit crop is vexjng some of the orchard
ists.
SEASON FOR SUISUN
IS RECORD-BREAKER
SANTA MARIA, May 15.â Santa Maria
Valley includes the northern part of
Santa Barbara County. The natural
feed _ is about equal to that of last year
and cattle and dairy interests are some
what better. The grain crops are In splen
did condition. The early hay cutting was
very near last year's supply. Separately
considered, oats are Â¦ equal or perhaps
slightly in excess of last year's showing.
Wheat is about equal, and barley prob
ably a quarter less. The total yield Is a
little less, but much depends, however,
on the ripening weather for the balance
cf the month. zÂ£ , ,
LANDS GIVE PROMISE
OF ENORMOUS YIELD
SANTA MARIA VALLEY
SHOWS GOOD CROPS
Grainâ On account of lack of rainfall,
the prospects for both wheat and barley
are anything but encouraging, and the
yield will not be more than 20 to 25 per
cent of last year's crop.
Fruitâ The outlook for all varieties of
fruit is very good in this section, and
the output will be 50 per cent better
than last year's.
Honeyâ The outlook for honey is any
thing but promising, and from present
prospects the yield will be from 40 to
50 per cent below last year's. Bee men
from the back country/Teport that if they
can make enough honey to carry their
bees through the winter it .is all they
expect.
Sugar beets â On account of the in
creased acreage of this production the
yield will be a great deal larger tnan last
year, and the prospects are good, taking
into consideration the small amount of
rainfall.
HUENEME, May 15.â Beansâ On ac
count of increased acreage planted to
sugar beets, the bean average will be
reduced about 20 per cent, and, taking
into consideration the lack of moisture,
there cannot be expected a yield of more
than two-thirds of last year's crop.
HUENEME'S ORCHARD
-AND FIELD EPITOME
VALLEJO,, May. 15.â There have been
few seasons in the past twenty years
when crop prospects were so promis
ing at this time-of the year as they are
at present. "Encouraged by early rains,
the ranchers planted a great number of
acres to grain. 'Â¦'. Midwinter rains were
heavy, spring showers have been- timely,
and as there has been an absence of dam
aging north winds the prospect for a
heavy yield is highly encouraging. Tracts
devoted to hay are being harvested with*
good results.
In the large fruit producing sections of
Sulsun and Vaca valleys conditions that
have been favorable to other crops are
producing a heavy yield of fruit, which in
some localities is almost beyond expecta
tions. In Vaca Valley the orchardists,
fearing a scarcity of help to gather their
crops, have already taken steps to pro
cure labor, and offer good wages. In East
ern Solaho considerable attention is .be
ing paid to the cutting of flax, and- the
results, which have been watched with
much interest, are decidedly encouraging.
At Vacaville and Suisun a heavy crop of
cherries Is being handled. The fruit Is be
ing sent East by the carload. . ' /

The apple Â¦ yield is double that .of- last
year, because of young orchards coming
Into bearing. Prospects are good for po
tatoes and onions, the acreage of which is
double that of last year. The acreage of
beans is about the-same as last year's,
and the prospects are fair. There is one
half .acreage of red mustard," with the
probability of a one-half 'average yield,
antl a double acreage of yellow mustard
as compared with last year, with better
than a one-half yield. The barley crop is
light and the acreage small. Several
thousand acres of red oats was planted,
and there will be a heavy crop.
LOMPOC, May 15.â Apples, pears, and
apricots are setting well, with > suf-
KINGS C1TT, May 15.â The prospects
for a grain crop in the vicinity of
Kings 'City are discouraging. In some
favored localities quite a heavy yield of
both wheat and barley is expected, espe
cially where the ground was seeded early,
but in many districts all kinds of grain
have been backward. Not so large a
yield is expected this season as was pro
duced last year, but there will be a better
quality of wheat and barley. ThÂ« Spreck
els Sugar Company has about 2000 acres
of barley under Irrigation an& In good
condition, promising a heavy yield; also
has about 400 acres of alfalfa under Irri
gation, which is in first-class condition.
Sugar beets are making a good growth
and an average yield is expected.
The fruit crop promises to be far ahead
oi that of last year, as young fruit is well
set on the trees, and unless unexpected
heavy frosts destroy them the yield will
be heavy, considering the small acreage
planted to fruit.
FINE FRUIT OUTLOOK

LOMPOC TREES BEAR
WEALTH OF BLOSSOMS
The. apple outlook is very encouraging
and the crop will exceed that of last year,
which was 2500 carloads, barring unfore
seen obstacles. Beet planting is pro
gressing nicely, with conditions favorable
for a good crop. About 5000 acres will be
planted. Considerable land will be seeded
to corn in this- vicinity. Black oats will
yield well. The Â¦ ground Is in excellent
shape to receive seed, as rains have fallen
at favorable periods throughout the win
ter and spring. The farmers of this vicin
ity are actively . engaged in putting In
their late crops, and every one looks for
ward to a record-breaking crop year in
this valley. There have been no late dam
aging frosts this spring, and the presence
of. damp weather and foggy mornings
have favored growing crops by keeping
the moisture in the soil.
WATSONVILLE, May 15.â The crop
prospects in the Pajaro Valley have
not been more favorable for years
than they are at present. The Indications
are that all crops will do as well as last
year, and some will be much heavier. The
and early cherry crops will be the
largest In years. The berry crop is tn
splendid condition, and it is estimated
that 60,000 chests will be grown in Pajaro
.Valley this season.
I ANCASTER, May 15.â Never in the
I history of Antelope Valley has there
been such bright prospects for decidu
ous fruits as now. Almonds are perfect
in yield and quality. The apple and apri
cot crops are the finest ever known here
and the trees are loaded. An abundance
of feed and seed is about all that is ex
pected from the wheat crop. The acreage
is about the same as last year. There is
.an increased acreage and yield of. alfalfa
around Lancaster, as well as a large num
ber of new artesian wells. Several machines
are kept busy boring artesian wells for
irrigation purposes in the vicinity. The
main crops this year for exportation will
be deciduous fruits, almonds and alfalfa.

valley grain lands will be summer fallow,
which will be beneficial in the long run,
and the total yield as compared with last
year will be about 70 per cent. The hor
ticultural reports tell ! a different story,
the fruit prospects being excellent.* All
kinds of fruits, including prunes, earlv
and late, are promising a heavy yield.
:Even the generally unreliable Moorpark
apricot is bearing heavily. Grapes will
produce over the best former yield.
Bee men look for a good honey crop, as
the early bloom on the desert supplied
the hives with the nÂ«r?essary nectar.
The sugar beet crop is the largest ever
planted in Southern California, and the
start of the factories is but ninety days
removed. Thinning out of beets is now in
progress.
The outlook for the bean crop, as far as
acreage is concerned, is not favorable.
The first apricots from the Yuma coun
try were marketed here yesterday at a
price of $3 25 for ten-pound boxes. The
yield is very large.
From Indio the watermelon crop is re
ported as 100 per cent heavier than last
year, and shipments of melons and can
teloupes will commence in about two
weeks. The crop of loquats was never
larger and the fruit is of immense size.

The outlook for wheat and barley is

EF^r^A VORED by bounteous crops, the California orchardist and agriculturist faces the danger
J[ that the supply of labor may be inadequate to insure a timely harvest. Throughout the fruit
area the demand for pickers and packers will be greater this year than ever before. Even now the
dearth of toilers is causing alarm, where a thinning of crowded blossoms on heavily bearing trees
is essential. With a cry for more laborers going out from every fruit and grain* district of interior
California, the "drniy of the unemployed" in the cities of the coast will be but a memory ere the

MAY ABANDON ISLAND.
The horrors of the islands of Martinique
and St. Vincent are beginning to take thÂ«
place in the London newspapers usually
occupied by discussions as to the probable
outcome of. Boer peace conferences at y c<
reenlnging. Transvaal. Practically all thÂ»
dispatches describing the scenes at the
time of or after the eruptions come from
New York and many ot tne papers con
tent themselves with publishing the most
striking phrases of these reports.
Thus* the Westminster Gazette saya:

volcano there.
REALIZE THE HORROR.
The Associated Press is authorized to
announce â¢ officially on behalf of both the
Foreign Office and the Colonial Office that
President Roosevelt's offer has created
the deepest gratitude here. All the of
ficials declare that no occurrence of re
cent years has so brought home to them
the deep and material friendship ex!3tins
between the two Governments.
Lord Monkbretton, Mr. Chamberlain's
secretary, said to a representative of the
Associated Press:
"We are Indeed grateful to America.
Our only difficulty is to insure an equit
able distribution of the relief sent from
all sources. Until we hear from the Gov
ernor of St. Vincent we believed it would
have been better to defer organizing a
system - of distribution, though anything
sent to him .will doubtless be well applied.
Experience from- previous -disasters
teaches us that unprincipled persons take
advantage of charity and that a man who
has only had his pig stye burned down
will demand a new house, we have heard
nothing to-day and find it difficult to com
municate with St. Vincent." â
Chamberlain has contributed Â£o0 to tne
Mansion House West Indian relief fund.
DEEP GBATITUDE.
Colonial Secretary Chamberlain wrote
to the Foreign Office to-night desiring
Lord Lansdowne very gracefully to

Mr. Roosevelt that Chamberlain cabled

LONDON, May 15.â Two messages ex
pressing sympathy regarding the loss of
life at St. Vincent have been ; received at
the Foreign Office here from the United
States Government. One was private and
the other official. The former was verb
ally presented by Mr. Choate, the United
States Embassador, whom Lord Lans
downe the Foreign Secretary, thanked
for the message.
w W WASHINGTON, May 15.-
I H / By direction of the Presi
ta /M j dent. Secretary Hay â¢ on
VaX lm/ Ma y I 2 sent the following
Mr If cablegram to Embasaa
dor Choate at London:
The prices of food are advancing. The
destruction of the livestock of the island
has also caused a rise In the price of
meat. A British warship has arrived here
from Trinidad, bringing provisions for the
relief of the sufferers.
There are decomposed bodies in many
houses, and in order to guard against dis
ease it will probably be necessary for the
authorities to bum these dwellings. Ow
ing to the many difficulties in the way of
those who have the matter in hand many
bodleB have not yet been interred. As
wide areas of ground which formerly
produced foodstuffs have been devastated
there is to-day an abnormal demand for
breadstuffs and a consequent scarcity of
food supplies.
Owing to the destruction of several
estates, the sugar and arrow root indus
tries of St. Vincent are seriously injured.
Destitution prevails among the laboring
classes, who are without homes, without
clothes and hungry. Nearly 2000 deaths on
this island have been reported. Bodies
have been discovered in life-like attitudes,
presenting grewsome spectacles.
INDUSTRIES INJURED.
Owing to the, great heat It is still im
possible to approach La Soufriere volcano
from the leeward side.
Interesting discoveries have been made
regarding physical changes on St. Vincent
resulting from the eruptions. Several fis
sures have been observed on La Soufriere.
The estate of Walibou has disappeared
and has been replaced by an inlet of the
sea. . . ".,'..
Richmond, an estate adjoining which
was formerly flat, and upon which there
were a number of laborers' cottages, has
been completely burned and out of the
estate there now arises a large ledge of
ground. It is believed that Rabacci cra
ter, in the Windward district of the isl
and, has also erupted.
From a distance La Soufriere. although
less violent, still wears a cap of dark
clouds which is illumined now and then
by flashes of red light. Volcanic dust fell
here again yesterday, but fortunately
there has been several heavy rain showers
which have washed away the dust from
the grass and restored the verdure of the
nelos. The condition of the atmosphere is
also apparently improving. ; .
Two eruptions of less magnitude than
the first occurred Saturday, May 10, and
from then until to-day nre and smoke
have been ascending at intervals from the
craters.
PHYSICAL CHANGES.
Friday morning:. May 9, large stones and
volcanic dust fell in the neighborhood of
(Georgetown for two hours, terrifying the
people there. A cloud of hot vapor then
passed over that part.
The damage done to St. Vincent by the
volcanic eruptions is now known to be
much greater than was at flrst estimated.
The present uneasiness of the inhabitants
of the Island is increased by the continu
ous activity of the volcanoes. .â¢ .

views In the matter, the decision was
reached to have the warrants sworn out
in Montreal and served on Messrs. Gay

the question of holding them for extradi
tion before, the Montreal authorities.
The expectation here is that when ar
raigned by . the Montreal authorities
Messrs. Gaynor and Greene will endeavor
to secure their release by habeas corpus
proceedings. Any efforts in that line will
be vigorously resisted by Erwin, who has
employed a well-known firm of attorneys
of Montreal to assist him in whatever
proceedings are had. The confident belief
of the officials here is that this Govern
ment will be able to secure the extradi
tion of the two men, in which case they
will be taken to Savannah for trial.
When asked whom he represented in
the transaction Stenger smilingly -, an

PHILADELPHIA RECORD
SOLD AT PUBLIC AUCTION
The House to-day was plunged Into a
new debate on Philippine affairs. Thus
far the subject of alleged atrocities In the
islands has engaged the attention of the
Senate alone and only occasionally echoes
have been heard In the House. But to
day the reports of cruelty and outrage
were rehearsed" In the Houae with ve
hemence and bitterness. The naval bill
was the order of the day, but it received
only scant attention after the allegations
of Philippine outrages were presented. A
speech by Vandiver of Missouri, reciting
instances of alleged outrages, brought on
the discussion. Personalities and. recrim
inations were freely passed about. Van
diver was supported in his criticisms by
Wheeler of Kentucky, while vehement de
fenses of tjie American soldiers were made
by Hepburn of Iowa, Grow of Pennsylva
nia, Hill of Connecticut, W. A. Smith of
Michigan and Lessler of New York.
General debate on the naval bill closed
at 4 o>clock, and when the House ad
journed the measure was being read for
amendment.
The bill providing for the erection of a
union railway station in Washington and
the fortifications appropriation bill were
passed.
WASHINGTON, May 15.â An extended
speech by McLaurin of Mississippi in op
position to the pending Philippine govern
ment bill was a feature of to-day's ses
sion of the Senate. The Mississippi-Sen
ator- vigorously assailed the : administra
tion's policy In the Philippines. He dep
recated the outrages perpetrated In the
islands, whether they were .committed by
the Filipinos or by the Americans. They
were, In his judgment, the natural growth
of the Government's policy, for which, he
maintained, the Republican party' ' was
responsible. He urged the abandonment
of the policy in the Interest of humanity
and Justice. He declared that the minority
was not discussing the pending measure
to obtain political capital, as all the polit
ical material which the Democrats de
sired had been made for them by the Re
publicans in this Congress.

SAYS GREAT WAVE OF DEADLY GAS
The officials here satisfied themselves
after a thorough investigation that
Messrs. Gaynor and Greene felt reason
ably secure from extradition while In
Quebec. because of local conditions exist
ing there. They feared that if the men
were arrested in Quebec resort would be
had immediately to habeas corpiw. pro
ceedings and they would be released' >'or
this reason and In accord with Erwin's

WASHINGTON, May 15.-The arrest of
Messrs. Gaynor and Greene was the re
sult of a carefully prepared and well
matured, plan devised by the government
officials, acting under instructions of the
Department of Justice of the United
States. Its inception dates back to . the
time when Gaynor and Greene left ' the
United States and took up their residence
in Quebec. The officials here then began
consideration of the question of the best
means to have them extradited and
brought back to Savannah, Ga., for trial.
The extradition treaty between Great
Britain and the United States was care
fully studied, and the conclusion reached
that there existed good grounds for the
extradition of the men. To Marion Er
win, who has figured prominently in the
conduct of the cases at Savannah, was
assigned the duty of proceeding to Can
ada and assisting the government in the
attempt to secure the return of the twe
men to the United States.
PLANNED AT WASHINGTON.
Marion Erwin, District Attorney for the
Southern District of Georgia, swore out
the warrants before Judge Desnoy call
ing for the arrest of Gaynor and Greene.
The extradition of wealthy Americans
In Quebec has in the past been attended
with a great deal 4)1 difficulty, and so
Erwin laid his information In the Mon
treal courts.
SOREL, Quebec, May 15.â Instructions
nave been received here to close the
grates of the Richelieu Canal so that the
tug Spray cannot pass through en route tÂ»
the United States.
While the petitions were being prepared
a special train was ordered over the Can
adian Pacific and atÂ«3:50 the chase began.
On the train are Messrs. Cannon and
Chaveau, attorneys in this city, who are
bearers of the petition; High Constable
Gale and eight detectives.
MONTREAL. May 15.â A special to the
Gazette from Three Rivers says:
The tug Spray with Chief Carpenter, his
aids and Colonel Gaynor and Captain
Oreene. prisoners, passed Three Rivers at
7:15 o'clock this evening under full head
of steam. Two Quebec policemen and two
detectives who sought with the ferryboat
Glacial to intercept the Spray failed ut
terly.
The petitions were sworn to â¢ by Mrs.
Gaynor, who alleges that her husband and
Greene were taken away against their
consent and without giving them time to
see their counsel or take legal measures
to prevent their arrest.
Upon the return of Mrs. Gaynor to the
city the lawyers in the case had a short
consultation with her and immediately
two petitions for habeas corpus, ordering
the return of Gaynor and Greene to this
city, were prepared and two orders wert
signed to that effect by Judge Andrews
in the Superior Court. In the meantime
four members of the provincial police left
by the 1:15 Canadian Pacific Railroad
train for Three Rivers, with orders to se
cure a tug there and try to Intercept the
Spray. The latter town Js ninety miles
from Quebec and Just half way between
here and Montreal.
Half an hour after the departure of the
Spray a tug was engaged by Mrs. Gaynor.
She went on board with Detective Walsh.
The pursuit of the Spray was given up
at Cape Rouge, eight miles from the city.
The Spray was then almost out of sight
down the river.
PTJESTJE THE TUQ.
While the arrest of Greene was being
accomplished Burke and the other de
tectives went to the Chateau Frontenac
Colonel Gaynor was standing at the
clerk's desk as they entered. Three de
tectives walked up to Gaynor, one taking
held of his right arm and the other his
ieft, while Burke produced a legal paper.
Colonel Gaynor asked permission to get
his overcoat, but he was not permitted to
do so, and the four hurried out to the cab
end started for the wharf at a rapid pace.
These proceedings occupied about
twenty minutes. The hotel notified Colonel
Gaynor's counsel of what had occurred.
The Attorney General's department and
Judge Chauveau were then notified, and
they In turn asked the police to investi
e&te the matter.
Greer.e was heard to say, "Wait a min
ute until I see a friend," but this was de
r.ied him, and the three detectives and
Greene entered the cab and were driven
to the wharf.
At 10:30 o'clock a well dressed man en
gaged a cabman by the hour and instruct
ed him to wait near the postofQce. Soon
afterward Burke, with another cab, ar
rived. Burke and two other men who
came up walked toward the Chateau
Frontenac, which is near by. In the
meantime Greene, who had entered the
postofflce. as was his dally custom, came
cut of the main door. Two strangers who
had been in waiting in a store near by
crossed the street, and one of them, plac
ing his hand on Greene's shoulder, pulled
a document from his pocket and asked
him to enter the first cab. ' â¢
This morning Donald McMaster, a prom
inent lawyer cf Montreal, who is engaged
by the prosecution, arrived here by boat
from Montreal. On the same boat with
him were six detectives, Including Chief
Carpenter of Montreal. They were met
at the wharf on their arrival by Detective
liurke.
The arrests were made on warrants Is
sued in Montreal, Chief "Wilkle's men as
sisting In the arrest. The men were hur
ried on board a swift little tug, which had
been kept in waiting at the wharf. Ten
minutes after Greene and Gaynor were
safely on board the boat steamed out Into
the river and started toward Montreal.
The officers moved so quickly that neither
of the prisoners was given an opportu
nity to consult counsel. When notified of
hei husband's arrest Mrs. Gaynor at once
consulted Tachereau, her husband's at
torney. A tug was chartered and an at
tempt was made to overtake the boat on
which Gaj-nor and Greene were being
carried away.
After a short chase those on the pur
suing tug, seeing that It would be Impos
sible to overtake the detectives* boat, the
Spray, one of the swiftest boats on the
St. Lawrence, the pursuit was abandoned.
On returning to the city it was decided
to charter a special train and attempt to
head off the Spray at some point between
this city and Montreal.
When the two Americans first arrived in
Quebec they were followed by two men,
also from the United States, who regis
tered at the Chateau Frontenac. Their
movements led the hotel employes to be
lieve that they were detectives sent here
to watch Greene and Gaynor. It now de
velops that one of these men Is Detective
Burke of Florida.
GREENE IS ARRESTED.
QUEBEC, May 15.â John F. Gaynor and
W. D. Greene, who forfeited their ball at
Savannah, Ga., early In March and fled to
Canada, were placed under arrest by of
ficers connected with the United States
secret service and Chief Carter of the
Montreal detective force to-day.

CHICAGO, May .15.â Esther Dowie,

having suffered for hours without medical
attendance, while "Elijah II" prayed for
her. :
Miss Dowie was 23 years of age and a
student at the University of. Chicago.
Yesterday morning her hair caught fire
from a gas jet and her head and face
were horribly burned. Nurses placed
salve on the patient's wounds, as tho
Dowie doctrine allows of the use of medi
cine externally. Meanwhile .the "divine

his arrival the attendants were. excluded

all day. He refused to cease even to
take the nourishment which his followers
pressed upon him. The patient wa3 un
conscious most of the time, but even {his
did not move the father to breakfrom niÂ»
doctrine and send for medical aid. The
patient died at 9 o'clock In great agory,
having returned to consciousness a short
time before. News of the death did not
come out until to-day, when the Coroner
was notified. xl^ v-'* "â¢â¢ J v^-
At the inquest "Dr." Dowie frequently
broke down under his grief. He declared
that his daughter's night robe had been
burned from her body, and that vasellue
had been rubbed on her by Deacon
Speicher's orders.- Speicher has a license,
to practice medicine. He declared ' that
during the afternoon the patient's condi
tion had becorne very serious and that
Dr. Campbell, a medical practitioner, had"
been sent for to consult with Dr. Speich-'

there was little hope. Dowie declared
that -when Esther regained consciousness
she asked him to pray J for her.- At no
time, he said, had she asked for medical
attendance. The jury then returned a
verdict that death was due to burns acci

While visiting Washington Lord" Kelvin appeared
before the House committee and gave a strong in
dorsement to the bill, saying he has frequently urged
the British Government to adopt the system. As
a rule all men of science have favored the measure,
but the manufacturers of, the country oppose it on the
ground that a very heavy loss would be. incurred in
making, the, change from one standard of measure
ment to another. Military and naval officers also de
clare that to make the change compulsory, - would
It is quite probable that an attempt to bring about
the general use of the metric system ia this country
by a drastic measure of compulsion. would be unpop
ular and would rouse a discontent that would go far
to defeat the desired object,- but still it is not easy
to see how the improvement can be brought about
by any other means. The way to adopt the system
is to adopt it, and that can be effected only by gov
ernmental action, for it is only through the Govern
ment that there .can be brought -about that wide
spread, simultaneous acceptance of the change- which
is essential to its success. ' It required a - legislative'
act to reform the calendar, to. establish a decimal sys
tem of currency. and. to make other improvements of
a similar kind. .The objection to the 'so-called "force
bill" on this subject is therefore invalid. /If the met
ric system be good enough to be adopted at all it
should be adopted. by law. '
AFRESH effort has been made by the advo
cates of the adoption by, this country of the
metric system of measurements to carry their
plan through Congress at .this session, and the result
is they have obtained from the House Committee on
Coinage, Weights and Measures a favorable report
upon the Shafroth bill. As the bill imposes the metric
system upon, every' department of the United States
Government and niakes it the. legal standard of the
country after July 1,-1904, in all unofficial work and
trade, it has become known among the opponents of
the system as the "metric force bill," and a good deal
of opposition has been arrayed against it.

BOET FORETOLD
V DESTRUCTION
OF ST. PIERRE
The situation is not without admonition to the Re
publican party. Being practically without opposi
tion it will need wisdom and self-control to keep it
out of the excesses which are natural to a 1 party under
such circumstances. Without such self-denial its
misfortune will come, probably not from the existing
Â¦ discordant and weak Democracy, but from some new
movement, conjured out of many fragments, as was
the Republican party in. 1856
It may be that Croker knew that the end had come
and made a virtue of necessity by stepping down in
favor of Nixon, careless of what might follow, or it
may be that he really sought to cleanse the robes of
Tammany and make it a respectable organization.
Whatever may have been his motive, the suspicion
that Nixon would cleanse the party and compel both
political and personal respectability has caused his
downfall and will probably put Tammany perma
nently in a minority in New York. It has had de
fenders heretofore who affected to see in it merely a
finely drilled and ably led political body, with no
more indirection in its methods or dirt on its hands
than \.as to be expected of a political body in a great
city. These defenders have treated its offenses as
incidents only, impinging upon a general uprightness
of purpose. The resignation of Nixon has reversed
all this. Tammany appears now with indirection and
shady politics as its purpose, and the few tatters of
virtue it displays as mere incidents, while the whole
body of its purpose :s wrong, a partnership with vice
and a means of controlling the lowest social elements,-,
not for their uplifting, but to recruit their- ranks.
Heretofore men of good character have not beenj
altogether ashamed to train >^ith Tammany, though |
none such has been suspected of dictating its meth
ods or sharing in its spoils coming from crime and
vice. Hereafter it may be doubted whether any such
men will be found in its ranks.
Â¦ Nixon's resignation is a distinct political sensation.
Taken in connection with Mr. Bryan's weekly as
sault upon every man in the party who seems likely to
become prominent as a nominee in 1904, it increases,
the difficulties of the reorganizes and defers still
further the time hoped for when the party would be
restored to popular confidence. That hope was
largely founded upon Nixon's supposed ability to
jjurge Tammany of the evil reputation left by, Tweed,
Kelly and Croker. That done, with a renewal of the
old alliance between Tammany and the South, there
seemed to be some hope of putting the Democracy,
in line for success. But the plan has failed. Bryan
quarreled with Nixon, has abused Hill, Lamont and
Watterson, and the situation looks a good deal like
a f|ud over probating the estate of a deceased bank
rupt.
In Tweed's time Mr. Oakey Hall, a man of re
spectable character, was Tammany's Mayor, but with
the express understanding that his respectability was
to be personal and not official. To this he consented,
and his character served as an ambush behind which
Tweed ruled and robbed the city with a generosity of
dishonesty that was almost royal. So it has been with
every Tammany Mayor who lias served under Tweed,
Kelly and Croker down to Van Wyck. But it was
suspected that Shepard would be officially respec
table, and the rank and file, the gangs that live on
the festering vices of the great city, the touts and
heelers, were languid in their support and Low won.
THE sudden resignation of the leadership of
Tammany by Mr. Nixon adds to the complica
tions that distract the national Democracy.
When Croker selected Mr. Shepard as his candidate
for Mayor against Mr. Low it became evident that
the role of respectability then assumed was not
fitted to the Tammany organization. That wonderful
body has maintained itself for a long time by control
ling elements that are not recognized as respectable in
politics. A nominee, to succeed, had to be under
stood and recognized as willing to stand as a figure
head, while the chief of Tammany was the actual
power in the government of the city.
HEADLESS TAMMA.NY.
That the United States needs some stimulus,
toward the establishment of a higher technical train-;
ing to fit young men'; to improve our industrial.meth
ods is probably true; although we are doing a great
deal in that way. Some of our technical institutes
are attracting students from Europe itself. â¢ ,' Still we
are behind Germany, and it behooves us to. catchup.
We must not rely too much -upon native energy arid
natural resources.' Having . the; richest possibilities
ir: the world, we must -fit ourselves to make the best
By way of applying his report to the American
people the Consul says: "Have we sufficient scien
tific education of the best grade, and are our educa
tional institutions in close enough touch with the
manufacturers to supply their needs?. If not we are
hampered in competition with our great commercial
rival, which" enjoys i this complete co-operation."
Reviewing the course of ".instruction in the em
pire the Consul says the young German is called
upon to decide early in life whether he will take' a
classical or scientific course. If he chooses the lat
ter he is trained for the Polytechnicum, or institute
of technology, ,\vhich is from the universi
ties. The faculties of th^se institutions keep in touch
with the manufacturers,' and when capable young
men graduate they easily find situations.
, By the application of science to industry the Ger
mans have not only-'imprpved old industries .but;de
vised new ones. The invention of a process of manu
facturing 1 artificial indigo started, an industry which
now gives employment to 6000 men arid a staff of 148
skilled chemists.' The German scientists have also
discovered 'a method of obtaining ground slag from
steel processes which is - used , as ' a fertilizer, and
Great Britain, although 1 she "'produces as much steel
as Germany, has become . a good customer for the
article.
The Consul points cut in the first place that tech
nical education had its beginning in Germany long bo
fore the Franco-Prussian war and that its good results
wej2 soon observable. 'â¢'â¢' Sixty years ago Liebig had
fifty" students working in his factory, aind to-day there
are in German factories -;' '4500 thoroughly trained
chemists, with more, than 5600 assistants whose
brains are continually at .work -upon problems of im
proving proces'ses'-'of industry arid lessening the cost
of production. : . ; . : ; â¢ * : -: ; 7:
The development of the siigar Tnduatry is cited a3
an example of the profits derived from applying
science to industry. " In '1840 the Germans were able
to extract from their beets only 5^ per cent of raw
sugar. In i860 they .were able to extract 8 per cent
Last year the percentage of sugar obtained was raised
to 13 per' cent. The. advance was entirely due,, to
scientific . research, and the increase of . wealth ob
tained from . it is to be attributed to education and
not to state aid. Another illustration^ of the same
truth is found, in the growth of the industry engaged
in the production: of dry colors, chemicals and dyes.
In. 1874 the total output of such products in" Ger
imahy'was-but $6,6o6,oop, while.in A898,Inotarithstand
ing a large decrease in the price of the articles, the
output, was valued at $30,000,000.
>'.>â> \ONSULAR REPORTS for May contains an
I Â¦Â¦â¢(' article -by ; Ozifhan of. Stuttgart on
'.'-The Practical Application of , Scientific
Education in Germany/' which goes far to explain
the enormous successes; achieved by the Germans in
industry and commerce. These successes have been
in recent years one of the marvels of our, time. Some
authorities have attributed them to the stimulus given
to German enterprise by the establishment of the
empire and the huge indemnity exacted ft*ai France.
Others have sought to find their origin in the aid
and subsidies granted to various' industries n by the
Government. Each of those factions doubtless
counts for much in the problem, but Consul Oz
man's report affords good reason for believing that
scientific training applied to business, has done more
for Germany than Government aid and the - French
indemnity combined. ' , ' "

- At the close of Governor ,Odell's speech

hearty handshake, and a pleasant word.
.Thank : you for the button. I will always
wear it and remember under what pleasant cir
cumstances it came to my â¢ hand.' ' ;
â¢I understand that the New York 8ociety was
formed at the time of the Spanish war, - and
one of Its purposes was to welcome back the
soldiers from the Philippines. I can readily
understand this. New York has -from the ear
liest history of this country shown itself ready
to help; !n. every, way possible the national
Government. When I look at you all here, gath
ered around me, I can certainly understand
why you left your native State.. I can't blame
youâ I have experienced many of the delights of
California â and yet I know In your hearts that
many times your memories go back | to your
boyhood days in the Empire State. "
INTRODUCED TO GTJEST.
" I have on my. tour visited the South, as well
as the West, and am proud of the sentiment
expressed and the good feeling shown to. New
York. This is quite a novelty, after the ex
perience we have had dealing with Congress,
which has been anything but pleasant. ,Â¦
It is with great gratification that I learn I
have been elected a member of your order.
I can readily understand . that the forming of
the society was actuated through love ' for the
old spot' of your birth. I am not surprised to
hear, that you natives of^ New York lead a
strenuous lifeâ they are always noted for active
interests in business affairs. It. is with great
pleasure that I am here in this empire of the
West," and I feel assured that the New York
ers will do their share to build up and help
to improve this great country. V. Â¦ *
"We are here, Governor, to welcome the exec
utive head of our native State, and we most
cordially greet you. j We also .wish to Inform
you that you are elected a member of the New
Yorkers. : . . -
Governor Odell replied in accepting the
button: ' - ': : â¢Â¦.
ELECTED < A MEMBER.
Governor Odell: '.The gentlemen you see be
fore you are hero to represent the organization
of the New Yorkers.- That there are not more
present illustrates the fact we all lead a strenu
ous life," out here- and many are "denied the
pleasure; of meeting you here to-day owing to
business demands.'., &
Upon the arrival, of the distinguished
guest "General W. H. L. Barnes in a brief
speech notified * him that" he had been
elected; ah honorary., member of the' New
Yorkers, arid on. behalf of the organiza
tion presented him' with a handsome blue
and; gold, button of the order.* General
Barnes said: â¢ '
The reception began at 3 o'clock, and at
that * time about twenty members of . the
New York : Society were present, waiting
to be presented to Governor Odell. Col
onel H; P.' Bush and "Colonel: C. Mason
Kinne were, delegated as a committee to
escort the guest into the' room. - . ' : .'
A pleasant i little reunion occurred . yes
terday afternoon, at the Palace Hotel,
when'Go'vernor. Odell ; of New -York* was
tendered an": informal reception "by the
members of- the New York Society of Cali
fornia. This association is formed by res
idents of California who claim the Em
pire State as their birthplace.
Of course the exchange made on Puget Sound will
increase with local population and production, and
they will contribute to local profit .and to the growth
of Seattle. But San Francisco, in the lush-abun
dance of production . in California, from resources
that are only scratched superficially, feels no fear of
her own future and" no jealousy pf the future of
Seattle. 'Â¦_Â£' :
It is that sort of theoretical greatness which has
been used by the boom cities. Fort Scott, Kans., tried
to alarm the world by publishing a map showing
that town to be in the center of the earth. But im
mediately the town of Hutchinson issued a map
proving that it was the center of the planet. â¢ Then
many other towns made the discovery that the hori
zon is a perfect circle around any given^ point of the
globe and that every place is the center of the earth.
Then everybody breathed easier, and as the town of
Hutchinson had extensive and profitable salt .wells
it immediately proceeded to outrun and outgrow
Fort Scott, and the latter has only a few miles; of
lot stakes to show for the advantages of its central
position.
Trade depends^ upon something besides geography
and imaginary, commercial circles. The trade cen-,
ters of Europe have shifted many times and may shift*
again. Wisby, in the far and frozen northj once con
trolled the trade of that hemisphere, and so did Ven
ice, . and after her Genoa, in the soft and clement
south. Then it passed the pillars of Hercules to the
Low Countries, and finally crossed the channel to the
British Isles.
" The immediate presence of production ' ; arid con
sumption is. a factor in centering trade. The fric
tion of exchange deposits the profit of commerce.
The enormous _ and varied production of California
is the stable quality in the commerce of San Fran
cisco. Trade that merely passes "through a place
from a distant point of production to a distant point
of exchange deposits no profit in transit. .The ad
vantage claimed for Seattle, and proved by a great
circle that has no more substantial existence and in
fluence than the witch circles that used to terrify the
superstitious, is an advantage shared equally by
Bitter Creek, Medicine Bow, Puyallup, Walla Walla
and every station on the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern through which trains pass carrying freight
to a far away point of exchange. . > -Vj
After ali it is not worthy the commercial dignity
of that enterprising Â»city. If a circle artist should
draw his pencil through the Atlantic Ocean the
same sort of a line would locate all the trade of the
Atlantic seaboard with Europe at Portland, Me.,
leaving New York a small speck made by a small fly
in an idle moment.
It is a most depressing circle and is quite 'enough
to cause a fall in real estate in this city. It is intro
duced with the statement that "the bulge of the earth
favors Puget Sound," and gives Seattle the bulge on
San Francisco. 'Looking at the f6rmidable and ad
monitory chart, one wonders at the self-denial of
our. enterprising neighbor. While inventing trade
circles and stringing them around the planet like
seams on' a baseball this portentous line might as
well have been thrown over San Francisco with the
statement that it compel^ us to go to Seattle to do
our shopping.
The last demonstration of this kind is rather in
teresting. The Post-Intelligencer graces its pages
with a map of the globe, embracing the hemisphere
from about Winnemucca to Borneo. Across this is
drawn Hogarth's line of beauty, a curve that starts i
at the Anaconda copptr mine, crosses the Siskiyou
Mountains, plunges into . the Pacific hajf Â¦ way be T ;
twecn Seattle and San Francisco, and goes whizzing
across the ocean to New Guinea. This is called "The i
Great Circle dividing the" globe into trade hemi
spheres." All the trade north of it belongs to, Seattle.-
That city has filed a caveat on it. The trade south 1
of it is given to San i Francisco, and consists of the
commerce of the Society. Islands, Hawaii, a small
piece of New Guinea and a few miles of the coast of
Australia. "
But Seattle pays this city the^complimerit of con
stantly attacking its primacy in commerce, showing
its mislocatioru lack of facilities and its forlorn situ
ation generally.
SAN FRANCISCO has not indicated any fear or
jealousy of Seattle and her growing trade. The
frequent statement of its percentage' of increase
has caused no disquiet here, because starting at zero
any trade must be stated at once in hundreds of per
cent increase. . .' "Tv

Objections' made on the score of cost are valid and
merit consideration even from the scientists who
are most eager to put into effect the metric measure

I 718 Market Street * |The proposition to change from, an open
ballot to a secret ballot for the election
of grand officers was defeated.
' During the afternoon the election for
high officers was held. Max Boehm, who
for twelve consecutive years held the of
ilce of high chief ranger, * concluded
that having served the order well during
that time and done much to bring it to
its present state of prominence he was
entitled to a rest, so he declined to allow
his name to be presented for nomination.
The ballots taken resulted in "the choice
of the â¢ following named: J. B. Sanford
of Mendocino, high chief ranger; O. M.
Goldaracena of San Francisco, high sub
chief ranger; G. W. Lunt of San Francis
co, high treasurer, sixth year; J. J. Rob
erts of Oakland, high court secretary; W.
Deputy A. U. Field, one of the official
organizers, occuped the attention of the
delegates for some time with a detailed
account of his work.
it was decided to continue the Forest
ers' Advocate as the official organ of the
order. Â¦ \
The report of the committee on tha
state of "the order was presented and
adopted. This shows a gain in two years
of more than 2000 members and the addi
tion of forty-eight new courts.

not: the name of Walter Gaines on his

The precedent for but one term as
grand president of the Native Daughters
of the Golden West was established by
Mrs. Tina L. Kane, the first grand presi
dent of tha order. At the close of her
term that office was tendered to her again,
but she refused the proffered honor, while
appreciating the devotion and loyalty that
prompted it. It remains to be seen if
the rule will be broken this year.
One matter that has been agitating: the
general membership for several weeks
past has been the report that the friends
of the Incumbent president. Mrs. Baker,
who is the leader of one faction of the
order, propose to run her for a second
term for the office of grand president In
order to defeat the ambition of Grand Vice
President Miss Keith, who is the leader
of the other faction. Ever since the or
der has been organized no 'one who has
served in the capacity of grand president
has ever submitted her name for a second
term. Â»
The next session of the Grand Parlor ot
the Native Daughters of the Golden "West
will be held in this city in the early part
of June. On account of strong factional
feelings the session promises to be one of
the most Interesting that has ever been
held by the order.

It was reported; last, night that Presi
dent , McCarthy was losing ground rap
idly'by reason, of his : failure to win the
contractors, to his cause.. He had asserted
that the contractors would infallibly cast
their lot with the Building. Trades Coun
cil, and 'their failure to io so fell into
McCarthy's camp with the effect of a
bombshell. It is known that , many men
of McCarthy's own. union 1 are disgusted
with the troubles, which have resulted
only in loss of time and money to them,
and they are on the eve of revolt, against
their chief.? In any event the situation is
greatly | strained and impor^nt develop
ments are expected. ;-.â¢;.
At a largely attended meeting of the
Building Trades Council at B'nal B'rith
Hall last night ' the Â¦ action ' of the master
builders in deciding, to remain, neutral
was discussed. The resolutions adopted
by the contractors were not relished by
the council. The statements of the Dis
trict Council of the Brotherhood that
they had the sympathy and support* of
the plumbers, lathers and others of the
building trades were characterized as
false. The discussion of the existing trou
bles was marked by bitterness.
Several affidavits sworn to before nota
ries were filed with the District Council
of the Brotherhood announcing that " the
brotherhood men interested in the fight
number 1433. The unions are No.. 483 with
614 men, No. 36 with 501, No. 304 with 118,
No. 616 with 50 and No. 1082 with 150. It
is claimed that the carpenters affiliated
with the Building Trades Council cannot
show one-half this enumerated. strength.
At a meeting of the. District Council of
the Brotherhood last night reports. were
received that the authority of the agents
of the Building Trades Council, was being
generally ignored by union men on all the
buildings. In one or two instances tho
agents were ordered to ] leave the , build
ings, and when they refused they were
forcibly ejected. The union carpenters de
clare they will no longer submit to the
domination of McCarthy, and as the days
pass the ranks of the unions favoring the
brotherhood are being swelled.
The action taken by the Builders' As
sociation to remain neutral in the fight
now being waged by the Building Trades
Council against the Brotherhood of Car
penters and Joiners has greatly encour
aged the members of the latter organiza
tion, and they are now certain they will
win their fight.

If time i3 given to inspect the delegate
tickets and ascertain if the nominees
thereon are genuine stalwart anti-boss
Republicans, Gage will get no aid and
comfort from the Son Francisco delega
tion to the Republican State convention.
Nothing, of course, was said of the
time consumed and the money expended
by the railroad managers in the vain
effort to elect D. M. Burns to the United
States Senate, and no reference was made
to the raw programme by which Wella
was nominated for Mayor. Harriman
listened attentively to the tale. He asked
about the three jabberwocks, . Buckley,
Crimmins and Kelly, who were slain by
the beamish boy of the law department and
then took the narrative under advise
ment. "
It Is the impression that the political
bosses attached to the Southern Pjtolfia
will hear from President Harriman beiopfe
the present gubernatorial campaign is>
many weeks older. . The President took
note of the situation here and doubtless
perceived that the company might -place
Itself in a very unfortunate position if
Its prestige and power were further used
to bolster up the failing fortunes of an un
popular candidate for . Governor. The
Bhadow of impending disaster hangs over
the boss camp. The chief strength of
the Gage machine is the Southern Pacific
Company's supposed backing. When the
president makes the declaration clear and
positive that the company has no candi
date for Governor, Gage will not be con
sidered a factor in the fight.
The Directors of the Republican Pri
mary League "will meet this evening to
resume work on the plans of Assembly
district organization. There is a strong
sentiment â¢ in the directory favorable to'
the nomination of delegates to the State
convention at least three days before Au
gust 12, the date of the primary election.
The league has no candidate for Governor,
but the. Republican voters composing the
league are opposed to Gage because he
has surrendered the administration of
State affairs to the bosses. The voters
willâ want to" know before "the" day of
election whether any Gage sympathizers
are on the ticket
While In San Francisco E. H. Harri
man, president of the Southern Pacific,
made several inquiries touching the
railroad company's interest in political
affairs. It is definitely known that he ex
pressed a desire that the company should
not take an active part in politics. All
scrts of stories were told to him to ac
count for the railroad's past activity In
the political field and to justify the pres
ent attitude of the law department of
the corporation. The "agreed story" told
by those, who are anxious to protect
Herrin represented that the people want
ed the company to take an active part in
public affairs. It was said that wicked
bosses such as Buckley, Crlmmins and
Kelly had dominated both parties and
plundered the people before the railroad
company stepped in to protect the com
monwealth "from the rapacity of ring
politicians. Harriman was told that the
organization of the railroad's political
bureau, under the enlightened super
vjsion of Herrin, put the ringsters of both
parties out of business and thus protect
ed the taxpayers.
In order to strengthen the boss machine
in Humboldt County Governor Gage has
allowed. J. C.\ Bull to name the successor
of Walter Parker, expert of the State
Board of Examiners. Bull has recom
mended for the position Accountant Em
erson of Eureka. Bull has a hard battle
on his hands and needs help in his fight
to bring down a Gage delegation from
that county. Emerson's appointment to
succeed Parker will probably ! be an
nounced to-day. The salary attaching to
the position is $2000 per. annurn, and the
allowance for traveling expenses" is lib
eral. . . ' . Â¦ :

The steamship Ventura, which Balls on May
22 for Honolulu and Australia, will carry 'as
part of her cargo about 1200 tons of flour and
more than 500 tons of grain. As the shipments
of flour to the Orient have fallen off. eo have
they increased to the Antipodes, where a suc
cession of rainless summers has reduced the
producing power of Australian and New Zea
land soil to far below their food requirements.
The steamship Georpe W. Elder, which arrived
yesterday from Portland with a large shipment
of flour, discharged 20,000 sacks at the Oceanic
Dock for shipment on the Ventura.

that haa been reported of the widespread suf

Antofagasta and San Francisco will give some

THE American bark Yosemlte, out
142 days from Newcastle, Austra
lia, for Guaymas and laden with
coal that experts deem as com
bustible as live wires after being
more than 100 days on chipboard, and
Quoted at 60 per cent on the reinsured
list, has arrived safely at her destination.
Speculators that played her to arrive
have won handsomely. Underwriters are
out a heavy premium and are beginning
tc place little reliance on the spontaneous
combustion specialists, whose theories are
a sain kicked to death by a fact. Every
thing seemed against the \osemltes ar
rival: She was nearly three months over
due; ehe is an old ship; she was laden
Â¦with New South Wales coal. In the race
of these facts 60 per cent seemed a low
rate, and had the Yosemlte's voyage been
prolonged a few days the rate would
have taken a very material jump. The
Yosemlte arrived, however, and now the
attention of the reinsurance speculators
is directed toward the German ship H. F.
Glade, the rate on which was advanced
>esterday to 80 per cent. The Glade is
now out 208 days from this port for Eng
land, and speculation on her chance of ar
rival is very heavy, both here and in
London.

Important . Decision p Is Rendered in
Mayor Schmitz, who is desirous of main
taining harmony among city officials sug
gested that Webster and his deputies
meet with the Board of Education in an
endeavor to settle the disputed point, and
this will be done next week.
Superintendent Webster stated that the
Directors had expressed the opinion that
the Superintendent should assume the re
sponsibility of designating .inefficient
teacehers in order that the Board of Edu
cation could dismiss them from the de
partment. â¢ Â¦ â¢Â¦ ,*;- ..-.. ;
Webster took issue with- the board, and
producing the charter, and State law
pointed out to the Mayor that In neither
instrument â¢ was there any specific provis
ion requiring him or his deputies to inquire
into the efficiency of teachers. , Webster
contended that this duty lay with the
principals of the various schools.
Superintendent of Schools Webster, with'
his deputies, L. A. Jordan, W. Kingsbury,
Dr. Howard and D. J. â¢ Sullivan,.; held - a
conference yesterday with Mayor Schmitz

He hurried to the bedside of the sufferer
and found him writhing in terrible pain.

Both men were convicted yesterday. by

of the crime of conspiracy to make coun

Harrison street last February and on the
13th of that month two policemen search
ed their valises and found twenty-five
counterfeit $5 pieces all completed, except
the gilding. For this reason, and because
of a ruling of Judge de Haven in 'the
Fritch case last year, that ungilded white
metal $5 pieces could not deceive any one
and therefore could not be considered as
counterfeits in the penal sense, the indict
ment was found for conspiracy. McDon
ough asserted that the coins and tools
were the property of Gray and Gray de
nied their ownership. On his trial for
shooting and killing a man in Colorado a
few years ago, McDonough proved self
defense and the jury acquitted him with
out leaving their seats. He is very bit

yesterday or select a successor to Nixon.
It was predicted that a thorough politi

ure.
I have not. been dictating to Nixon. On the
contrary, I have been taking no active inter

everybody to support Nixon. It was a benevo

had no cause to resign. I am sorry and hope
he will reconsider his determination. It will

WASHINGTON, May 15.â As the Presi
dent, after considering the report of Col
onel Crowder, has decided that he cannot
interfere with the cattle shipments at
Port Chalmette, La., and as the executive
is the only branch of the Government
clothed by the constitution to pass upon
the application of the laws of neutrality,
as expressly affirmed by the Louisiana
courts recently, it is not believed here
that the Louisiana State authorities will
seek to make an issue with the Federal
courts by undertaking to do what the
President himself has not seen fit to do.
It is presumed that in due course the
executive's decision will be communicated
to the Governor of Louisiana, who first
brought the Port Chalmette operations to
the attention of the National Government.
The source from which the Dally Mail

Lord Pauncefote obtained his highest
official and personal popularity under the
McKinley administration. He was re
garded as a firm friend of this Govern
ment in the war with Spain and the recent
attempt to show he had written a note to
be presented by the corps of embassadors
to McKinley, showing their hostility to
the believed purpose of the United States
to go to war with Spain, has never found
credence among those who knew him.
Lord Pauncefote. who is dean of the
diplomatic corps, is known by sight to
everybody in Washington. His white
hair and mustache, sturdy frame, ruddy
English complexion and genial manners
and appearance all combined to make him
the most picturesque character in Wash
ington. .
Pauncefote never held a diplomatic post
until he came to Washington in' 1889 as
the successor to Lord Sackville-West, who
was recalled on complaint of Secretary
Bayard because he advised former Britisn
subjects In California to vote for Cleve

> President Nicholls of the first district
was the first great champion of the strike
advocates. Mitchell; who was the last to
speak, was listened to with the greatest
attention. It is also said that a telegram
was read from the American Federation
of .Labor against a pefmartent suspension.
But the delegates' would not listen, and
amid suppressed excitement the vote was
taken. .For a time it looked as though
the peace advocates would win, but when
delegation after delegation from the lower
district, the last to be called, answered
"Yes", it was seen that the men who fa
vored a fight had .won. The result was re
ceived by the convention with applause,
which, however, was not very enthusias
ti.* or prolonged. The men appreciated
the seriousness of their, decision, which
no doubt dampened their ardor.
The miners insist that fiearly all the
engineers, firemen and pump runners be
long to their organization and say that
they can get all to quit if they wish to.
In the event this is brought about it
would do incalculable damage to the
mines through flooding, unless the com
panies can fill the men's places.
President Mitchell was apparently in
good humor to-night. He was pressed
for an opinion on the situation, but he
refused. Wilkesbarre probably will be
the strike headquarters.
President Mitchell's advice to the miners
was for peace,' and he gave it to them in
the plainest and most forceful of Ian-,
guage. He was ably assisted by Presi
dent Fahey and Secretary Hartley of the
lower district and Secretary Dempsey of
the upper territory: "
Â¦ â¢ While the : leaders are cautious and not
forecasting their -actions,, it is not un
likely that the miners' fight will be car
ried into the bituminous coal regions and
into other- fields of industry. Mine work
ers ' for eight months have been looking
forward to the strike that is now upon
them. For the strike they have saved
their money and are considered to be in
better shape to-day for a fight than they
were â¢ in the great strike of 1900. That
struggle ended in the mine owners giving
the men a 10 per cent advance after a six
months' suspension. The operatora-^are
on record as being unalterably opposed to
granting -the men any concessions and
they have informed the "mine workers'
leaders of that fact. The workers fear
that, the (present fight may mean the de
struction of their . organization, because
they believe that the â¢ operators are
bent more on wrecking their organization
than they are in opposing the demands
for higher wages and shorter work days. |j
HAZLETON,;Pa.,May 15.â The anthra
cite mine workers, in convention late this
afternoon,, decided to continue the .strike
of 145,000 men '.'against the mine owners
and to fight it out to the bitter end. The
matter, of calling out the engineers, fire
men and pump runners. will be decided by
the I delegates 'to-morrow; The vote to
continue the suspension "vsas as follows:
Total vote cast, 811; ; for, strike, 461&;
against strike, 349% ; majority v f or strike,
111%. Â¦' )
President Mitchell, however, in com
pliance with the rules of the United Mine
Workers, announced to the public that the
action of the convention was unanimous.
The office of inspector was abolished
this term by request o* President
Wheeler, the position not being considered
of importance enough to maintain a high

By accident Miss Robie met her down

had gone, never, to return to him.
Chrisler had been paying attention !Â¦ to

Special Dispatch to The. Call.
Among the belongings of McCoy found
during the police raid was a bludgeon a
foot long, with a leather sack filled with
hard putty at one end. Chief of Police
Hodgkins believes Baldwin is not a dis
charged marine, but is one of the prison
ers who escaped from the Presidio sev
eral months ago by tunneling under a
stockade fence. The Chief says the credit
for these arrests belongs to Night Cap
tain Petersen, Sergeant of Police Green
and Detective George Kyte.
Both of the footpads have signed state
ments, which the police have filed for
use during: their examinations. In the
course of his confession, McCoy said:
"It's no use, if you hadn't arrested the
whole gang we could have proved alibis.
I don't care if I get fifty years."
.About the time of the Belden hold-up,
Mrs. A. Martin, a stranger, who was
visiting in Oakland, was stopped on Har
rison street by two men, who choked and
6ea.rcb.ed her for valuables. This robbery
Â¦was also reported to the police, who se
cured from McCoy and Baldwin their ad
missions of guilt in this affair as well.
The other robbery was that of Dan F.
Belden, a prominent society man of this
city, who was stood up by McCoy and
Baldwin on the night of May 3 on Jack
son street, near Fourteenth, and robbed
of a gold watch, pin and money. Belden,
who was perfectly self-possessed during
the hold-up, remembered his assailants'
appearance and he had little difficulty In
recognizing them to-day at the City
Prison,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway, May 15.
James McCoy and Walter' Baldwin have
confessed to the police that they are
guilty of three robberies and one at
tempted hold-up which have occurred in
this city -within a couple of weeks. Be
fore Chief of PoUce Hodgkins. Captain of
Police Petersen and Detective Kyte, the
men, who have been in custody for several
days, admitted their part in the crimes.
The pair will be formally charged at once^
Two of the robberies have already been
made public â that of Newton Blodgett

DOAN'S KIDNEY POLS.
MSANFRANCISCO \
Every Claim -Is Backed by Local
Testimony.
If the reader wants stronger proof than
the following statement and experience
of a citizen here at home, what can it be?
Charles E. Schwartz, paper hanger,
decorator, painter and whltener, residenc*
1731 Eddy street, shop 310 O'Farrell street,
says: "For at least twenty years I have
been subject to kidney complaint but for
the last twelve the attacks were much
more pronounced and of much longer du-
ration. "When a man has been laid up
several times so that he could not leave
the house, when he used everything on
the market which came. to his notice from
reading newspapers or which he was ad-
vised to use by hi3 friend3, when he has
invested in the most expensive electric
belt procurable, when he has worn flannel
bandages over the kidneys for months,
when some of the attacks were so severe
that he fell on the street and had to be
.taken home, when the pain was iso great
that it actually caused nervous chills,
when the secretions from the kidneys
were dark brown. scÂ«Ided and robbed him
of many a night's sleep from their fre-
quency, when that man has become so
weak thatthe least exertion wearies him â¢
and causes his back to ache more severe-
ly, he naturally becomes enthusiastic
about the means he employs to get relief.
I used Doan's Kidney Pills, getting:. them
at the No -Percentage and the Owl .'druse
stores. If the first box had not given
undoubted improvement I never would
have spent the price of a second, because
I had lost faith in medicine to a certain
extent. ' You are at liberty to tell resi-
dents of San Francisco that I am more
than pleased to recommend Doan's Kid-
ney Pills and that I will repeat in a per-
sona) interview what - I have stated
above." . Â» - Â¦Â¦ .

Captain Spillane called upon Â¦ Sergeant
Gleeson yesterday afternoon and said that
Donovan's license should be taken from
him. , Several years ago Donovan shot and
killed a man over a dispute about some
la/id. -He was tried, convicted v and sen
tenced to be. hanged; but an appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court and' he was
granted a new trial and acquitted. At
that time ex-Judge Wallace, was on the
Supreme bench and when Donovan, was
brought before the Police Commissioners
about a year ago he pointed to Wallace
and said: "That man saved my life." -*,
Sunday afternoon a drunken man was
in â¢ Donovan s saloon ..and a crowd of boys
living' in the neighborhood .gathered- in
front of the saloon and began "joshing"
the drunken man. One of the boys threw
a rock into the saloon, which angered
Donovan, and seizing a* revolver, he came
'to the" door and fired five shots at the
boys. One of the bullets- whistled past
Gallagher's ear.
About a year ago Donovan fired Into a
crowd of boys and at that time he was
brought before j the Police ; Commissioners
and if it had not been for Commissioner.
Wallace would have lost his license. The
of the boys' thought* it was time
that Donovan's ready use of the revolver
should be stopped before a tragedy oc
curred and young Gallagher was selected
to make the complaint against him.: .

HAYTIANS HOPE
TO AVERT WAR
Other members contend that the result
cf these trial races conclusively proves
the soundness of the arguments advanced
by the minority when the subject of the
defense of the cup was being discussed at
the annual meeting. Their contention was
and is that trial races open to ail should
be sailed, and that the winner of these
should be fitted out at the expense of the
club. It was during the discussion of
this question that statements were made
which were afterward admitted to be
false, and which, until retracted, caused
so much unpleasantness in the club.
Some members think that perhaps the
speed of the Presto might be increased
sufficiently to defeat the Harpoon at an
expense of a few hundred dollars more,
and suggest that the board of strategy,
which has the defense " of the cup in
charge, consult some of the experts re
garding the necessary changes. Joe Tracy,
one of the club's most successful racing
men, who made such a record for himself
in the Decoration day regatta in 1884, when
he was first to reach the mooring at Tlb
uron, might be consulted and give
valuable assistance. J. W. Pew has
had considerable experience in tuning
up ' boats. As a result of his ex
periments the Truant is third in her
class. Hawks, Brickell, Jennings and
Bowes are the owners of various yachts.
With the aid of these gentlemen there
can be little doubt that at an expense of
less than $1000 the Presto's speed could be
materially increased.
Now that the Harpoon has proved her
right to the honor of defending the cup
and earned the privilege of being fitted
out a^the club's expense, these questions
are asked by club members: "What bene
fit has the club derived from the money
spent on the Presto?" and _" Who is to
stand the loss?"
The principal topic of conversation
amon Corinthian Club yachtsmen dur
ing the past week was the unex
pected defeat of the Presto -bv the
Harpoon. So great was? the con
fidence in the Presto of the com
mittee appointed to select a defender of
the Challenge cup that more than $500
of the club's money was expended on
alterations to her without first determin
ing whether or -not she was the fastest
boat eligible to sail against the challenger.
On the other hand the owners of the Har
poon have thus far paid for the altera
tions on their boat themselves.
In the .first race on an. ebb tide the
I Harpoon showed that \ inÂ» running and
reaching she easily excelled the Presto,
and in the second trial on a flood tide
that she is much faster in windward
work.

SAN FRANCISCO.
Glendon's pitching was the only Inci
dent in yesterday's little argument at Re
creation Park: which looked good, and
it certainly . was â¢' good. He allowed
only two scattering g safe bumps and
they were as far apart as saloons in Kan
sas. He walked but one man and had
the commuters .up in the clouds all the
time. To, cap the climax he scored the
only runs of the game with a pretty half
trip awipe. to right. Score, 2 to 0.
The smiling Schmidt did the brainy
stunt for Swing and was the goods in
every turn but the second, when he issued
his only free passes and allowed two hits,
Just enough to give ' Uncle Henry the
game. After the second, they all went
out ' in ' one, j two, three order and there
was never any danger of an approach to
the plate by either team.
The game lacked vim" and life. It was
the same monotonous old thing that was
passed out Inning after Inning and the
finish could be seen from about the mid
dle of the combat. The Only lively bit
of playing happened in the fifth when
Brick Devereaux hit past third and stole
second. ' Glendon had an idea he could
catch the clever old red top. napping and
for nearly ten minutes kept slamming the
ball down to Holly. , â¢
Brick was hurt in the shuffle and four
or five times was nearly taken unawares.
He let out a few comical yells which did
more to please the crowd than the rest
of the players combined. \
Shugart opened the second with a stiff
single into right field. Leahy and Holly
took free passes and the bases* were filled
with no one- out. It looked like big doings,
but Schmidt struck Lawler. and Delmas
out. Glendon came to bat and Schmidt
seemed to have him buffaloed. He gave I
the batter two strikes and then threw
an easy ' straight ball over the oyster,
which Glendon soaked into right for two
bags, scoring Shugart and Leahy. If
Schmidt had thrown a curve to Glendon
it is likely that: there would have been
no runs. . , .â¢ .. Â¦
An inexcusable misplay occurred in the
third. â¢ Nordyke lifted a high one In baclc
of short and * Dunleavy, Gorton and
Franks stood rubbering and let the ball
drop. Dunleavy picked it up in order to
throw out Nordyke who was ' tearing
down to second and made a .wide throw.
He could have easily caught the- runner
had the 1 throw been anything like half
good. The score: .-"- Â¦
Judge Troutt granted Nellie Bartholo
mew a divorce from Albert Bartholomew
for desertion, and Judge Hunt allowed
Nellie J. Paige a divorce from William E.
Paige for extreme cruelty.
Judge Graham granted divorces to
Francis A. Andersen from Edith A. An
dersen for desertion, Cora A. Muller from
Horatio Muller for neglect and Louise
Keinertsen from Ludwig Reinertsen for
cruelty.
William S. Bctchelder, who was mar
ried to Isabella M. Batchelder in this city
in January, 189S, has brought a suit for
civorce on the ground of desertion. He
alleges that Mrs. Batchelder left him
three years ago and has ever since re
fused to return to him.
Bessie Viola Bleiman is suing Joseph
Bleirnan for divorce, alleging desertion
and failure to provide. They were mar
ried in December. 1889. Mrs. Bleiman al
leges that her husband abandoned her in
June. 1S30. and that for the last twelve
years she has had to depend upon the
charity of her relatives and friends for
support. *
Martin Frerichs, a Hayes street grocer,
who is being sued for divorce by Emma
Fierichs, filed an answer and cross-com
plaint to his wife's suit yesterday. Ho
ticnies Mrs. Frerichs' allegations, and al
leges that when he left her the separa
tion was the result of a mutual agree
ment. He admits that he owns property
worth $25,000; but says it is mortgaged for
M-I.500. When he left his wife three years
;iÂ£o. alleges Frerichs, he arranged his
vroperty so that she could have a home
fret- of rent and could also collect rentals
from his property amounting to $S0 a
month. He also alleges that he furnished
her with groceries free of charge. Not
withstanding all this, continues Frerichs,
his wife contracted bills amounting to
$1100. to pay which, he alleges, he was
compelled to rVaduce the rentals â¢allowed
his wife to $40 ' a month. He alleges fur
ther that eight years ago he found a lot
of poison in the house he occupied with
his wife. His wife, he alleges. Informed
him that it would not do him any good to
cestroy it, "as there was lots more where
liiat came from, and that he would re
< eive a dose of it some day."
Louis Darr is suing Frances Sophia
Parr for divorce for infidelity. He names
Morton Spencer as co-respondent.
According to a complaint for divorce
filed by Augusta Hansen against George
Hansen yesterday, she has been treated
In a cruel and Inhuman manner for the
last eight years by Hansen. She allege^,
that he cursed and abused" her on Innu
merable occasions and frequently choked
her and beat her until she was one mass
of bruises. She alleges further that he
once ejected her from their home with
great violence and prevented her from re
turning for several hours. She charges
clso that Hansen is addicted to the ex
tensive use of stimulants. The Han6ens
were married at Portland, Or., in 1880,
:tnd have two children, the custody of
whom Mrs. Hansen asks.
lenger, In her race against
the Corinthian defender of j the Per
petual Challenge cup, has long been
a devotee of aquatic sports. He Is
a life-member of the Boating, Associa
tion of the University of California, and
has sailed a great deal on the bay. It 1*

SOFTNESS OF SHAXSKIN
la Bivaled by Human Hair Where
Dandruff Is Eradicated.
Sealskin is admired the -world over for
Its softness and glossiness; and yet the
human hair is equally as soft and glossy
Â¦when healthy; and the radical cause of all
hair trouble is dandruff, -which is caused
by a pestiferous parasite that saps the.
vitality of the hair at its root. Newbro's
Kerplcide is the only preparation that is
fatal to the dandruff germ. Without dan-
druff no falling hair, but a luxuriant
growth of glossy, soft hair is certain.
Scouring the scalp won't cure dandruff.
Kill the dandruff germ. Thousands of
Â¦women owe their beautiful suits of , hair
to Newbro's Herpidde.

CHICAGO, May 15.â Wheat ruled easier
after a slight initial bulge that was occasioned
by firm cables. Some early buying was done
by a few commission houses and for the first
hour a firm tone was manifested. . July opened
%@%c to %@%c higher at 75%@75%c, but
trade was licht and unimportant and a few
big longs offered stuft on , the hard spots.
Weather reports showed rains where most
reeded and clear weather Northwest, -where
farmers have been waiting: for the spring seed-
Ing. Harvesting was reported in Texas. Sta
tistical Journals Issued bearish reports, which
discredited the value of, the recent Government
estimates. The outsiders were out of the mar
ket and reports from St. Louis showed declines
there that indicated free movement. There was
some pressure from the Southwest and the
Northwest. July sagged off to 75%c. Corn
strength that had bean helping wheat seemed
to be . ebbing away, and it was only a fair
export business that saved the close -from
marked weakness.-' Late the seaboard reported
21 loads taken and July closed easy, }4c lower,
at 75>/i@75*S,c. ; . v
Corn was poorly supported " and j suffered ac
cordingly. The market ' -dragged dull and
heavy. July closed weak, %c lower,- at 62%c.
. The early firmness in 'oats was soon dissipated
through an absence of support and some fair
offerings.' July closed %@%c lower at 38%c.
Provisions were heavy and weaker the
i greater part of the session. - Liquidation : was
â¢ induced by weakness of the hog market,.. The
close was weak. July pork 17 %c: down; lard

Benton. Polk, Lane and Linn counties prunes
owing to imperfect pollenization, are dropping
bafily and fears are entertained that the yields
will be very light. Cherries also .have suf
fered from cold rains and frosts, but they have

Hops have made a vigorous growth during
the week and the training of the vines is in
active progress. Late gardens are being planted
and the fanners in the valley are busy prepar
ing their land for corn and potatoes.
Grass of all kinds has made a. splendid
growth, and pastures everywhere are excellent
Cattle are petting fat. and the flow of milk in
the dairy districts is heavy. Stock is being
moved tÂ» the summer ranges, and sheep shear
ing te in active progress. The Increase In
lambs has been larger than usual and the wool
clip is up to the average In both quantity and
quality. â¢ â¢ 1 -
In general both fall and spring grain are do-
Ing splendidly. Some complaints are made of
weedy fields in Umatilla County, and worms
Â¦re beginning to do slight damage In Gill lam
and Sherman counties. In the Willamette Val
ley the warm weather has been beneficial to
somewhat sickly and yellow grain, but that
â¢ceded on low land is still somewhat sickly
end yellow on account of insufficient sunshine
and drying weather. Seeding in this valley will
be practically completed this week. In South
ern Oregon rye has begun to head, and early
planted corn has come up nicely. Summer fal
lowing is about finished In the Columbia River

Mail advices from London state that there is
a -continued demand for salmon from the coun
try, and the market continues steady. Por red
Alaska prices are firm, owing to the fact that
purplies of that variety are light in both the
Now York and San Francisco market. The
Xederland has arrived with 54.919 cases from
Fan Francisco, and the Glengarry with 19,329

the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville
jointly by the Southern Railway and Louis
ville and Nashville. The strength of the Chi
cago and Alton and Kansas City Southern
stocks was obviously based on a speculative
assumption that those roads might be availa
ble for a similar North and South junction.
In spite of the strengthening of competing
lint.? by the deal. Illinois Central was strong.
Loui&ville and Nashville was heavy, possibly
on realizing, and the early demand for South
ern Railway soon died out. The Chicago. In
dianapolis and Louisville stocks themselves
were decidedly feverish, relapsing violently and
advancing. A drop in Chicago and Eastern Il
linois, which has be-n discussed as a possible
outlet for Louisville and Nashville, reflected
disappointment. The upward movement in the
junior Vanderbilt stocks had Its Inception by a
speculative theory of relation to Chicago, In
dianapolis and Louisville. Amalgamated Cop

trade. General Electric Jumped 6 points with

T. P. "Woodward favored the raising of
the 51 limit, and figured that 7% per cent
Â¦would give the Board of Education a
yearly amount of $300,000 which could be
expended In building schools at points In
the city where they were most needed.
This view was also taken by the other
members of the Board of Education and
the sub-committee, which realized, that
the Interest on a bond Issue would
amount to very nearly the sum It was at
present asking for, and that it could not
be taken up until November, and that a
yearly appropriation of 5300,000 by the
raising of the 51 limit would permit them
to build new schoolhouses in those parts
of the city that most need them.
This appeal of the committee was taken
under advisement by the Finance Com
mittee.
Henry TJ. Brandensteln, chairman of
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, said the board, was confront
ed by a very Berious Issue, and Informed
the Board of Education that the charter
permitted the Board of Supervisors, in
case of great necessity, to raise the $1
limit, or a bond Issue could be put
through, and he asked the board whether
It would urge the Finance Committee to
raise the II limit.
A. Roncovleri, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Faulk
ner and James Denman all spoke at some
length, showing how much the classes
Â¦were clogged at the present time, and
showed that it was really necessary that
they should have between thirty and for
ty new teachers and the same number of
classes, and that six new buildings were
required-
Mr. O'Connor, chairman of the sub
committee, handed in a report covering
his personal Investigations. He felt sure
that the board could not run the depart
ment on the present amount allowed by
the Auditor, and that a further sum of
$300,000 should be added to the present ap
propriation of $1,200,000 for Immediate
needs. The total enrollment for the pres
ent year had been 50,136. which with a
maximum allowance of 532 50 per pupil
would give over $1,600,000.
Nearly all the schools are filled to over
flowing, they are all In need of repair
and in many of them the plumbing Is In
'wretched condition and the ventilation of
the poorest.
A. O. Mann of the sub-committee ex
plained to the ( Finance Committee the
present condition of many of the school
buildings and how totally inadequate and
insufficient the allowance made by the
Auditor in the budget would be.
The Board of Education and a sub
committee representing the teachers ap
peared before the Finance Committee of
the Board of Supervisors last night: and
advanced a very strong argument for a
yearly additional appropriation for the
betterment of the schoolhouses, additions
to the buildings and the construction of
new schoolhouses.

be intelligent and of good-*ioral charact^'

About two months ago burglars entered

Each claimed the other should make good

On the visit to Mrs. Darling Monday night
Levings wrote his name on a Press Club en
velope and left it with her with Instructions to
call him up at. police headquarters when she
had. the money ready. I have the envelope, and
It is . in Levings' handwriting. That incident
occurred at the Monday night visit, whlcn
Levings Ignores in his version of the affair
accounting for but two visits to the place.
Levings did not go to see Mrs. Darling under
Instructions from Chief Wittman. I That is ab
surd and it disgusts me to see such statements
in print Levings has got into a hole and he
Is trying to make it look as 41 the Chief was
standing in with him in the attempt to shake
the woman down. Of all absurd things that
is the most ridiculous. Leaving the Chiefs
Integrity out of . the question. It Is utterly non
sensical to think, he would do. this thing and
put himself in the power of a patrolman for
the sake of his share of the $150.
I do not know whether any more serious ac
tion wlll.be taken against Levings. It looks
serious enough now, for while the case might
not be complete enough for conviction on a
criminal charge, there seems to be enough evi
dence to make a decision easy for the Police
Commissioners. . ' â¢
LEVINGS LEAVES ADDRESS
Captain Seymour denounces -in strong
terms the attempt on the part of Levings
and others to make it appear, that the
patrolman was acting under* the instruc
tions of Chief of Police Wittman when he
visited Mrs. Darling and talked with her
about "squaring" Crothers' case for a
consideration of $150. Seymour said yes
terday:
If Levings said, as the woman claims he did,
that I sent him to see her he lies." I knew
nothing whatever ' of the case at that time.
Levings had made the arrest in the course of
his duty as a patrolman, on morning duty at
the City Hall station, i It fell to him as ar
resting officer to secure evidence, and the ' aid
of the detective service was not asked. No
report came to this office and I had absolutely
nothing to do with the case. / .
The first knowledge I had of the affair was
a week ago * Wednesday night, when Chief
Wittman told me of Levings having called him
out of the meeting of the Police Commissioners
to tell him of the "job" these people were put
ting up on him. ' ,
'â¢This, fellow Levings has been getting him
eelf into a bad hole, I'm afraid," the Chief
said ' to me, and then he told me Levings'
story. Â¦-.-.. Â¦ .
â¢ "Why did he go up there to see the woman?"
I asked. Â¦.....-'. ,
"That is what I asked him," the Chief said.
"It looks, to me as if he went for no- other
reason but to try to 'shake her down."
Levings told the Chief that Tuesday night he
had gone to Mrs. Darling's rooms, that night,
mind you, to search for evidence. He had al
ready, according to his own. later statements,
been there Sunday afternoon and again Mon
day night, claiming to be acting under my
instructions, knowing as he did that I had
no knowledge whatever of the case.
SEYMOUR INDIGNANT.
â¢ As I remember it, Levings told me something
about the young man being of a good family,
and having a mother who would be broken
hearted, and there was a suggestion In his con
versation Â¦ that if the charge were made petty
larceny Â¦ the , boy would probably be willing to
plead Â¦ guilty. I dismissed the matter from my
mind, however, with the statement that it was
plainly a case of obtaining money by false pre
tenses and that such ought to be the charge.
I do not' know, of course, what Levings' mo
tive was for telling me about the mother and
family, and; suggesting a Â¦ light charge.
"When Levings had told me of the case in
detail, I said that In my opinion the man
should Â¦ be 'â¢ charged with obtaining goods by
f al6e pretenses. - That closed the incident as
far as I was concerned. I did not tell .Lev
ings to wait, for my: opinion and did not ex
pect him to come back. As a matter of fact he
did not return. , Â¦, -. '
Another of Patrolman L. , L. Levings
many explanations in 1 the course of Â¦ his
handling of .the Crothers case has risen
up, to be a witness against him. District
Attorney Byington. says that the police
man did not' wait for an opinion from him.
and that Levings' assertion to Chief Witt
man to'that effect is false. . ... \
Levinga had told the Chief on Friday,
May 2, of Crothers' arrest and said the
accused had not been charged. He said
he wa3 afraid a conviction of grand lar
ceny covii not be secured, as in a similar
case the nrosecution had failed. Chief
Wittman told him to ask the advice of
District Attorney Byington. , Â¦- ,
Sunday morning, May 4, the Chief found
Crothers' name still on the detinue book
and asked Levings why the boy had not
been i charged. Levings said Byington
was too busy to give him an opinion, but
had promised to do so as early as possi
ble. Byington denounces this aa false
and says that Levings received his opin
ion at their only Interview. The District
Attorney said yesterday: .

A gentleman said to me the other day, "You spend a great
deal of money advertising, don't you, Gibson? I've seen youc':
ads a great many times."
That man was wrong â I don't spend so very much, but . I '
make every dollar count My advertising is original and I buy, it
right. I think it out myself, people notice it, read it, and because
I'm always doing something new they think I spend a lot of
money. That's the way I buy everything. My stock isn't the biggest
in San Francisco, but it's bought right. It's originalâ it's dif-
ferent. When you wear my styles they're noticed just like my ads.
I'm not so big, but I've lot of novelties bigger concerns can't get.
