President Roosevelt now has com-
plete power in the matter of an
American canal across the isthmus from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. With only
eight dissenting votes the House to
day accepted the conference agree
ment on the Senate bill. But it is
worthy of note th*at this action was only
taken after Representative Hepburn, by
Â¦whose name the House bill wag known,
stated his firm belief on the floor of the
House that the President would fail in
his negotiations with the Panama oom
paiiy and find the legal and diplomatic
difficulties too great 'to be set aside and
that the canal would finally be built by
the Nicaragua route. Hepburn also said
that be would not have signed the con

conclusion that it was the Senate bill or
no canal legislation whatever.

said that he had not changed his opin
ion in any degree on the main points
of difference between the Senate and the
House bill. In regard to the route, he
still believed in Nicaragua, and In reg'ard
to the construction, he still believed in
what he called the central idea, that in
the building of such a great work, far
removed from the American borders, all
the power should be placed In the hands
of one person Instead of a commission.
He thought that possible scanaal and
corruption could . be better avoided with
centralized power. In regard to the
route he said he did not think that the
new Panama Company had anything to
sell which the United * States ought * to
buy: He was very emphatic in his be
lief that the President would never find
his way clear to construct the canal by
the Panama route. After a brief, debate
the roll call was ordered on the adop
tion of the. conference report and It was
j accepted by the House by a vote of 252
to 8. Those voting In the negative were.
Ball (Texas), Bell (Colorado), Hay (Vir
ginia), Jones (Virginia), Clatude Kitchen
(North Cardlina), Loud (California), Ne
ville (Nebraska), Woods (California).
Senator Morgan later made a report to
the Senate and It was accepted in less
than a minute of time. The bill now goes
to the President for his signature.

"St. Pierre was the stronghold of the
white party. Elections were to be held on
May 10 and the officials were so busy In
suring their own election that they had no
time for relief measures. The central
committee in Fort de France, which re
ceived the requests of the northern towns
for relief, /divided themselves Into two
classes on the basis of whether they had
returned a majority for the'black or white
ticket. The towns which voted for white
candidates were blacklisted, while the
negro towns received all the flour and
other supplies they could use. If the
white towns were helped at all it was

ment became so intolerable that many of

One of the most important difference?
between the Senate and House '.bills is-
that.relating to coinage. The Senate pro
vided a silver standard somewhat In ex
tension and perfection' of that now in ex
istence. %The House measure provides a
gold standard system, with the gold dol
lar of the 'United- States as the standard
unit of value for the Islands. The main
coin is to be the peso, made in sliver, but
of gold value;, and this is , to be divided
into .subsidiary pieces of. money bearing
devices emblematic of American- sover
eignty.. Provision is al$o made for a sys
tem of paper currency, banks; and for a
complete financial system, the details be-
In?, different from those- Jn the Senate
measure, although following the â¢ same
general: lines.'. In dealing with the grant
of franchises,, the substitute places many
more restrictions on such grants than the
Senate bill. In" this respect restrictions
provided by the House follow the lines of
those provided for Porto Rico. Both bills
provide for acquiring the friar lands and
for the issue of bonds sufficient to pay
for. the Â¦ lands, ; the Senate provision . mak
ing the interest rate 4Va per, cent, the
House 5- per cent. Both measures contain
extended provisions relative r to timber
lands, harbor ' and Internal improvements
and for two delegate commissioners chos
en by . the Filipino people to represent
them in'Washington and to have the privi
lege of the floor of - the House,
The House substitute amplifies "the h\\
of rights" enumerated in the ' Senate
measure and adds to the number of issue
which can be appealed to the Suprem
Court of the United States. The Hous^
measure also defines, with greater detail
thanthe Senate, the rights of citizenshii
of those residing in the Islands, and pro
vides that all residents shall receive the
same protection from the United Statey
in respect to their relation with foreign
Governments as is accorded to citizens ol
the United States. Â¦ ' v - â¢
The Senate .bill contained- no such pro
vision. The Legislature- is to be chosen
after the "existing insurrection in tlit
Philippines shall have ceased and com
plete peace shall have been established
therein and the fact certified to the Presi
dent by the Philippine Commission."
The debate during the day was at times
of a lively character. The Democrats of
fered a multitude of amendments, but all
were voted down, including one offered
by Patterson of Tennessee to prohibit
slavery or involuntary servitude in the
islands. ;* The most Interest attached to
an amendment offered by McCall to the
end that the bill-declare the policy of the
United States to be to develop the capac
ity of the Filipinos for self-government
and pledging the faith of the United
States to grant them self-government. He
supported the amendment in an eloquent
speech, and the Democrats 'Â¦ challenged
their political adversaries to declare their j
future policy. - Grosvenor of Ohio and
Cooper of Wisconsin said it would be un
wise to mortgage the future by making
such a declaration now, and the latter
quoted Governor Taft as saying that such
a promise now would tend to prevent the
pacification of the islands. The amend
ment was lost, 89 to 128. It was a strict
party vote, except for McCall and Little
field of Maine, who voted with the Demo
crats for the . amendment.;
The. 'substitute for the Senate Philippine
civil government bill differs from . the bilr
as it passed the Senate in many minor
particulars, but principally in the follow
ing:-' ' Â¦". Â¦ Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦-â¢Â¦Â¦
The House substitute provides for a
complete system of civil government, with
a legislature to consist of two houses, one
of which shall be a popular assembly
elected by the Filipino people.
WASHINGTON, June 26.-At 8 o'clock
to-night at the end of a nine-hour session
and of a debate lasting night and day for
a week, the House passed the Philippine
civil government bill practically as it
came from the committee. It wajs a party
voteâ 141 to 97, with the exception of Mc-
Call of Massachusetts, who voted with
the Democrats. The minority substitute
for the establishment of a temporary gov

that they would accept us with open â¢ arms.
Even when Aguinaldo was at the height of his
power at Molalos. Admiral Seymour of the
British navy had told Aguinaldo that he should
tie to the Americans as they were. their best
friends. The Filipinos were then our frietida
and were helping us. We had no troops to
Jand. and I knew that the more closely- the
city was invested the easier, it would be to
take it when our own '.troops should Â¦ Â¦arrive.
Still I think we could have -got on as weil
without them. It was their own idea. We
all know that hindsight; Is .better than fore

given arms to Aguinaldo, notwithstand
ing the Governor General had told him
that he would surrender the city at. any

FILIPINOS ARE UNGRATEFTJI/.
When asked in cross-examination if he
had not repeated his original statement
to the Navy Department that the Fili
pinos were more capable ot Independent
government than the Cubans, Admiral
D6wey replied in the affirmative, saying:
The Hongkong Filipinos" had not, he
added, told him of any insurrection in the
Philippines and he -had consented to see
them on the same principle that a man
gives money' to a man to get rjdof him.
Indeed, he himself had given Aguinaldo
the first Information the latter had re
ceived that the Filipinos were assembling
near Manila. . .' â¢ ., ..
Rsturning from his departure from
Hongkong. Admiral Dewey repeated that
he had left for Manila without Aguinaldo,
saying he tfiad left as early as he did
largely because he wanted to get rid of
him and the other "little brown men,"
many of whom- were constantly coming
aboard the flagship.
"I was very busy," he said, "getting
ready for battle and they were -after
me constantly, taking up my time.' . None
of them went with me to Mirs Bay, for
various reasons. One of them failed to do
so, because he did not have his tooth
brush with him." â¢ â¢.
"He was Consul General of the United
States," Patterson of Tennessee* sug
gested, and the witness replied, "Yes, but
he had nothing to do with the attack on
Manila." " â¢ ; '
Admiral Dewey added that he was
pleased to supply the committee with this
history. It had, he said, never' been
printed and he had been reserving it with
the view of writing the story himself. He
had copies of some of the communications
received by him, made because of this
purpose, but none of those from Pratt, as
he regarded him as a busybody, devoting
much time to interfering with the busi
ness, of other people. . Â¦
GREW TIRED OF AGTTINALIX)!
The Spaniards were very fearful of the re
sult of such a course, and, therefore, ther
surrendered to me in advance. That was all
arranged, and there was no need for the loss
of a man In the capture of the city. It was
to be done at a signal, and no gun need have
been fired by us but for the desire -of 'the
Governor General, who said his honor de
manded that a few shots should be fired. So
that I had to flre and kill a few people, but
the Spaniards did not fire because of my warn
ing that It would be disastrous to the city
for them to do so. They had In the city 15,000
troops and forty -seven rifled guns.
WHY . HE FIRED , ON 5 CITY.
When Senator Lodge; askeid the admiral,
"Did you recofenize.the Filipino -republic?"
he replied: ,.. , - ,<.'
1 did not.' I never gave the' 'slightest recog
nition. I had no authority to do so, and,-be
sides, did not consider, it! an organized, gov
ernment. There was a reign of terror, and the
Filipino forces were riding roughshod over the
community, committing many acts of cruelty.
I sent word to Aguinaldo that he. must treat
his prisoners kindly, and. he replied that be
would. . . _ - . â¢. .
"What would -have been the. e'ffect- of
permitting the Filipino force to enter Ma
nila when our troops, entered?", asked
Senator Lodge. . Vi
pinos. The . admiral,' going into details,
said: Â¦ â¢ . ...
That proclamation was the first Intimation
I had received of the aspirations of the Fili
pino people for an Independent government.
Aguinaldo had never told me that the inde
pendence of his people was his aim. . But
when the proclamation came I thought noth
ing of it. Indeed. I attached so little import
ance to it that I did not cable it to Washing
ton, but left its transmission to the mails.*
After this time, on July 15, Aguinaldo
sent, to him from Bacoor tils flrst.procla
mation of the Independence of the Fili-
The admiral said that after. Aguinaldo
got his forces organized he ; occupied
Cavlte, but when he â¢ (Dewey) learned that
American troops were expected to arrive
soon he asked â¢ them to retire. ' They at
first demurred, but ' ultimately consented.
The Governor replied that if I, did not fire
on the city The shore batteries would remain
eilent. The Spanish flag was not taken down
but white flags were raised in token of sur
render and if I had Had with me 6000 troops
with which to occupy the city I could have
taken it and held it. I anchored my ships un
der his guns. 2000 yards away and lay - there
twenty-four ho-urs. During that time the Gov
ernor General sent word to me, several times
that he wanted to surrender to | me â to the
navy, j I could not entertain his proposition of
a formal surrender because of the lack of
troops to take possession of the <jjty,
Admiral Dewey said he had written the
Navy Department that the Filipinos were
more capable of self-government than the
Cubans because he saw that Congress
contemplated, giving independence to Cuba
and he knew that the American people
had little information concerning the Fil-
Jpios. - â¢ .
In explanation of his statement that the
city of Manila had surrendered on the day
of the destruction of the Spanish fleet
Admiral Dewey said that during thenaval
engagement land guns had been fired at
him by the shore batteries and that aa
soon as the Spanish sauadron was de
stroyed he steamed toward the city, send
ing word to the Government that if an
other shot was fired from the shore he
would fire on the city. Continuing, Admir
al Dewey said:-.
SURRENDER OF MANILA.
Admiral Dewey then said the Spanish
Government wanted to surrender the city
to him after the destruction of the fleet
and that he (Dewey) would have accep
ted the formal surrender if he had had
5000 troops to garrison the city. He told
about Agulnaldo's arrival, saying that he
put him ashore and told him to organize
his people. Aguinaldo came back dis
couraged and wanted to go to Japan, but
the admiral told him to continue his ef
forts. The admiral said he paid no at
tention to Agulnaldo's first proclamation
of independence of the Filipinos. Speak
ing of Aguinaldo's military operations,
he said he did wonderfully In whipping
the Spanish.
Admiral Dewey said emphatically that
he never had recognized Aguinaldo's
Government, nor did he salute Agulnal
do's flag, he never called Aguinaldo "gen
eral," but addressed him as Don EmlllÂ».
The admiral said he had not given the
Filipino Government the slightest recog
nition, that he had no authority to do
so and did not consider it an organized
government. He said the Spaniards wero
fearful of the Filipinos entering Manila
and therefore surrendered to him in ad
vance. He said there was no need for
the loss of a man in the capture of the
city. No gun would have been fired, but
for the desire of the Governor, who said
that his honor demanded that a few
-shots be fired, "So I had to fire and kill
a few people," said the admiral, but the.
Spaniards did not fire because be (Dew
ey) had warned them not to do so.
He did not believe the Filipinos could
have taken the city unaided, but the
Spaniards were ' greatly dembrallzed. The
admiral said he never received a letter
from Consul ,Pratt telling him he must
co-operate with Aguinaldo. He added that
Pratt wrote a number of foolish letters
about that time.. 1 ..
I then heard that there were a number of
Filipinos who desired to accompany the fleet
to Manila. All of them were young and earn
est. I did not attach much Importance to them
or to what they said. The day before we left
Hongkong I received a telegram from Consul
General Pratt, located at Singapore, saying
that Aguinaldo was at Singapore and would
Join me at Hongkong. I replied, "All right,
tell him to come, aboard," but I attached so
little importance to the message that I sailed
without Aguinaldo and before he arrived.
Th'.** -were then many promises as to what
t/:e Filipinos would do. but I did not depend
upon them. Consul Williams assured me that
upon our arrival and the firing of the first
gun 30.000 Filipinos would rise. None did
rise, and I frequently poked him on this point.
AGUINAI/DO'S PROCIiAMATION.
The admiral was questioned by Senator
Ledge. He said ho had first heard from
Aguinaldo and his friends about April 1,
1S9S, when it became certain that there
was to be war. Continuing, he said: -

In the chancel were Joseph H. Choate,

In the .nave about a thousand of the
Westminster Abbey ticketholders, main

Shortly before the big western doors
v.ere swung open, sunlight streamed in
and the Duke of Cambridge, leaning-, on
the arm of an equerry, walked to the
chancel.
A* 2 o'clock struck there arose from the
far end of the nave the clear notes of the
opening sentences of the litany, chanted
by four of the cathedral clergy. Their
tones were in such unison that they seem
ed to emanate from one powerful voice.
The choir took up the responses. At
each supplication the procession, with the
cross at its head, advanced a few steps
and then stood still until the response was
completed. Through the kneeling congre-

gatlon the choir advanced to the chancel
steps. A score of the clergy followed, and
behind them were ten Bishops in gorgeous
robes. Then came the Most Rev. Wil

bishop of York; the Most Rev. Frederick
Temple, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and the Lord Mayor, Sir Joseph C. Dims

read the lesson. Isaiah, chapter 38, verse
10. "I said in the cutting off of my days,
I shall go to the gates of the grave; I
am deprived of the residue of my years.
READS THE PRAYER.'
The Right Rev. Arthur F. W. Ingram,
Bishop of London, from the altar steps,
read the prayer: "O Lord, save the
King." His voice rang out to the furthest
recesses of the dome and brought a whole
souled response from the choir and the
congregation. -
The anthem and the singing of the
hymn, "Thine Arm, O Lord, in Days of
Old Was Strong to Heal and Save," and
Psalm SI concluded the Â«ser\ice, where
upon the Bishop of London, surrounded by
the Archbishops and Bishops, from the
altar steps, impressively pronounced the
benediction.
For a few moments complete silence
reigned and all heads were bowed in
prayer, after which the almost blind Arch
bishop of Canterbury was carefully led
down the steps, the procession re-formed
and the congregation .went into the sun
light, gladly discussing the wording of the
latest bulletin from Buckingham Palace.
Simultaneously a similar service was
conducted at St. Margaret's Church,
Westminster. It was largely attended by
Cabinet Ministers, peers and members of
the House of Commons, and was conclud
ed with singing "God Save the King."

with crowds of people who usually con

at the decorations gradually disappear

night bulletin and when that was posted
the royal residence, save for a few strag
glers, became deserted.. .
Inside ..the palace the members of the
royal family spent a quiet evening and
â¢the number of callers was smaller than
any night this week.
With the favorable progress of the
King there Is much discussion as to how
the coronation, will eventually be effected.
While nothing has in any way been def
initely settled,. it appears that King Ed
ward is likely to .celebrate this event
very quietly .and with merely the cere
mony that attends the opening of Parlia
ment. .
This consists of a drive direct to West
minster Abbey, accompanied by a small
escort, and a speedy return to Bucking
ham Palace,' and it is rumored that no
foreign princes or envoys will be espe
cially invited for the occasion. All this,
Oi course, is quite in the air, but it forms
one of the chief topics of London's daily
conversation.
Hundreds of visitors to . London, espe
cially Americans and people from the
country, flocked to Westminster Abbey
to-day and until late at night curious and

to undergo the ordeal of coronation. Had

he did not carry, out the rules which
were indispensable if he were desirous of

idea of visiting Aldershot in wet weather,
of entertainments, dinners and a railway

be entertained by any of his Majesty's
subjects suffering from the same com

"The crisis is generally reached within
the first forty-eight hours and is wholly
detected by means of temperature and
pulse. Heightened temperature and high
pulse indicate the formation of pus and
may necessitate reopening the incision."
".To a., satisfactory note in yesterday's

welcome echo is found in medical cir

the possibility of .a recrudescence of the

done to avert such a mischance."

last' night. "All I know is that I have not

am awaiting orders and if I am ordered

The major said he felt it was time for
patriotic men to withdraw when Â¦. trades
unionism stepped In and attempted to in
terfere with the celebration of the great
national holiday and practically dictate
what shall or shall not be done. - . Â¦-"Â¦Â¦}
The major further stated that the mili
tia will parade by themselves . on the
Fourth and will take no' part , In the,
plans of the local committee,' as a result
of the refusal to pay non-union men in
the regimental bands. The law provides
that the Guard shall parade on' the
Fourth and on Decoration Day,- but it
does not - prescribe when and where tho
parade shall take place., . : . ; ."'

Major W. A. Desborough said that he
had resigned the ' chairmanship : of the
Fourth of July parade committee because
of the way the National Guard. was being
treated. .
J. A. Vaughan, assistant secretary of
; the Fourth of July committee; stated that
matters were very much in the same con
dition as they were yesterday, except that
he had received a report from the Musi
clans' Union of the resolutions passed at
tbeir afternoon session and that he had
sent out a special call for the parade,
finance and music committees to meet at
3 o'clock to-day at the California Hotel,
an hour in advance of the regular meet
ing, to see whether something could not
be done to harmonize matters. - '
Davis was asked if there would be any
objection to the bandsmen of the Guard
being paid for their services out of the
funds appropriated by the city for the
celebration, but he declined to give an
answer, and said that the matter of pay
ing the bandsmen was for the committee
in charge to decide.
Sam Davis, secretary of the union, said
that while the union was breaking one of
its rules In walking in line with non
union men/ he deemed the members too
patriotic to interfere in any way with the
success of the Fourth of July parade.
Mr. Davis further said that the Fourth
was the day that the" union musicians
looked forward to fo reap a little benefit,
and he did not see why, If the militia mu
sicians were so patriotically inclined; they
should not be willing to get out and play
for nothing.
After some discussion the directors
adopted a resolution that there would be
no objection to the enlisted musicians be
ing in line of the parade, provided, how
ever, that the bands paraded ahead of
their regiments.
The board of directors of the Musicians'
Protective Union held a meeting yester
day to consider the question of allowing
members of the organization to parade
oifl the Fourth of July with non-union
bandsmen of the National Guard.

WASHINGTON, June 26.â The record of
the court martial proceedings in the case
of Major L-. W. T. Waller of the marine
corps, who was acquitted of the charge of
illegally killing Filipino prisoners, was re
ceived at the War. Department to-day. It
will be considered by Secretary Root In
connection with the review of the testi
mony and findings of the court martial
in the case of Brigadier General' J. H.
Smith. The charges upon which both the
officers named were tried arose out of the
same transactions in the .conduct of the
Samar campaign. The Waller case was
closed witn the approval of the action of
the court martial which acquitted him,
but the Smith case is still subject to the
action of the President. Judge Advocate
General Davis Is now preparing the casa
for his action. It is generally under
stood that the court found that the
charges against General Smith were not
sustained and acquitted him. Owing to
the prominence ' of the case and the at
tention it has received in Congress in the
debates on the Philippine bill, the action
of the President in the matter is awaited
with more .than ordinary interest. The
impression prevails that he will improve
the opportunity to express his views on
the conduct of military affairs In the Phil
ippines. Â¦ . Â¦

Customs Collector Stratton has request
ed the United States District Attorney to
bring suit against the Japanese Steam
ship Company for $1000 penalty for allow
ing IJr. Yung Wing to escape from tha
Hong Kong Maru last week. .
The doctor had resided in New Haven.
Conn., for forty years and was return-
Ing from a visit to China. He wore the
American style of clothing and Bpoke pure
English without a foreign accent. For
that reason the customs Inspector at the
gangplank did not suspect him of being
a Chinaman and allowed him to pass out
with the white passengers. He came in
the first cabin and was manifested under
his true name. He had taken out na
turalization papers, but these are value
leas.
Collector Holds It Responsible for tha
Landing of Dr. Yung "Wing,
STEAMSHIP COMPANY SUED
FOB A HEAVY PENALTY
As a matter of diplomatic courtesy the
Collector will hold tha Chinese seals un

ton. Â¦
Dear sir: I am Informed that some lots of
stone Imperial Chinese seals and tablets are In
the possession of the customs office at this
port (some of which. I believe, are in the Ap
praiser's department of customs). As these
articles are undoubtedly official property of the
Chinese Government and that they are un n
lawfully in the possession of the persons who
brought them Into port, I beg to herewith put
In' my protest against delivering them up into
the hands of any persona whomsoever until
their absolute rights and status have been
proven. We will on behalf of our Government
put In our protest and application for their re
turn also with the department at "Washington.
D. C. Of course it will take us time to properly
produce our evidence as to the status of thsse
seals and tablets.
Ho Yow, the Imperial Chinese Consul.
General, has protested against surrender
ing to their owners the jade tablets and
seals found in the baggage of United
States military officers returning on Gov
ernment transports from China and tha

REDDING, June 26.â Because his "min
ing partner, D. G. Wheeler, accused him
of paying too much attention to -Mrs
Wheeler, D. F. Smith ' attacked Wheeler
with a club this morning at their claim
on Beegum Creek, in Shasta County,
about ten miles from Harrison Gulch.
Wheeler drew a revolver, fatally 'wound
ing Smith.
This is the story of Wheeler, who drove
to Harrison Gulch and gave himself up to
Constable Lowell Snively immediately
after the shooting. Wheeler had proposed
that if Smith would pay him for work
done on the claim he would leave wife,
mine and all other possessions to Smith.
This was the immediate cause of Smith's
anger. , .-'-. ;
The first two shots struck Smith in the
left shoulder. Smith ran for the cabin,
150 yards away, where there was a shot
gun he hoped to use. The now enraged
husband secured his rifle from a nearby
tree and fired eleven shots at the fleeing
and badly wounded man. One ball struck
Smith below the knee of the left leg, shat
tering the bone. Smith gained the cabin
however, and securing the gun, took a
seat near the door awaiting a further at
tack. -->;r^:
Without harming his wife, who had
been a silent witness of the shooting,
Wheeler hitched his horse to a cart, drove
to Harrison Gulch and surrendered. Dr.
R. H. Pitts left immediately to attend the
wounded man," but found him dead.
Wheeler has always borne a good reputa
tion m this county. He once lived in San
Francisco and in Oroville, working at the
carpenter's trade.
Harvard's oarsmen were â¢) all â¢ literally

was now almost a length ahead, the crim
sons' eight put their stroke up to 34. The
Yale boys held theirs at 30. The boats
zigzagged between the strokes for the
next minute until they were almost even.
Yale weakened a little, but soon she re
gained control of her boat and once more
the shells were practically even. ! The

KILLS PARTNER
IN HIS WRATH
CAPTAIN OF YALE'S "KIGHT."
WHICH WON A BRILLIANT VIC
TORY YESTERDAY.
NEW LONDON. ComC, June 26. â
Rowing within ten seconds of
record time the Yale Varsity
crew this afternoon lowered the
colors of the fastest "eight"
Harvard has yet produced. Yale won by
rour boat lengths in 20:20. Harvard's
time was 20:33.
In the four-oared race the colors of
Harvard were borne to the front. The
Cambridge four won by two and a half
lengths. In the freshmen race Yale's
crew led over the last mile until within
a few feet of the finish, where the Har
vard crew, by a magnificent spurt,
jumped their shell up even with the blue.
The judges decided the race a dead heat.
Twenty-flve thousand spectators saw
the Ells row to victory in the big var
sity race. TVhlle the crowd was great it
was the presence of President Roosevelt
which made the attendance unique In the
history of Yale and Harvard races. The
President saw the finish of all three
races from the deck of the Dolphin,
â¢which wa* anchored Just above the fin
ish line. He declined the Invitation of the
regatta, committee to go aboard Cor
nelius Vanderbilfs launch, the Mirage,
preferring to remain on board the Dol
phin, where he could be with his family.
iiore yachts than ever before Un the
Quarter of a century of Yale-Harvard
races on the broad Thames were- an
chored along the last mile and a half of
the course, forming a solid avenue and
feeing the river from bank to bank with
a. glorious tinge of colors. These above
the blue waters of the Thames made a
beautiful picture against the cloudless
e*y.
f?H K"rTR.ff GBEET r ''HH OABSHE2T.
Filled from end to Â«nd the two big ob
servation trains bearing more than 6000
people were bright with the gowns of
pretty women and the color* of Har
vard and Yala. Mighty cheers resound
ed Timing thÂ« green hills of Montville and
Gales Ferry as thÂ» Harvard eight rowed
over to the start, five minutes before 6
o'clock,
By 6:07 both crews were at the stake
boat. At 6:09 the pistol was fired and the
big shells leaped away. Harvard got the
better of the start and in ten strokes had
the nose of her shell a Quarter of a
length la front of the blues. The crim
e>on had the best water over the first
quarter- rnlle and her men made all out
cf It they possibly could.
Harvard started at 36 strokes to the
minute and Yale at SI At the end of the
first half-mile Harvard had dropped her
stroke to 34, while Yale still held hers at
22. At the half-mile flag the boat* were
dmost even.
Over the next half-mile thÂ« race was
a desperate struggle. The boats rig
sragged for a minuta and a half and then
the blue shell began to creep ahead. Yale
reached the mile flag In 5:04, two seconds
before Harvard. The Elis were two
thirds of a length ahead. Yale had
<iropped her etrcke to 31 per minute and
Harvard let her* down to 32.
On toward the two-mile flag; the power
ful eight* swung with mechanical preci
sion at tremendous speed. Harvard
dropped her stroke back to 32,. and now
the two strokes strung In exact unison.
But all thÂ« while the Yale shell kept
creeping & little bit ahead. At the two
mile flag Yale was leadlng-by four seconds.
Yale's time, was 10:11, Harvard's 10:15.
Vale eased up a bit in her stroke and
dropped it down to SL Harvard, seeing
Yale relax, Jumped hers up to 31 De
epite this spurt Yale picked up another
eecond between the two-mile and the two
end a half mile flags. Yale's tlmÂ© for the
two and a half mile* was 12:12, Harvard's
12:17.
TTATtVABJP COXSWAIN- EEES.
It was now a spurt for the last half
mile of the race. Yale raised her stroke
to S3 and then to 34. Harvard held hers
lit 34 for a minute, but had to drop it to
22. The Harvard coxswain made a bad
ness of his steering: over the last milÂ© of
the race. Long: before the crews reached
the three and a half mile flag- it was ap
parent Jackson eteered his ei^ht almost
squarely into the flagr post, so the oars
banned against It and the boat lost the
benefit of two or three seconds of time.
Harvard was plucky, despite the fact that
ehe was far behind, and gradually her
men struck their pace again and rowed it
out. McGraw was reeling in his seat an-i
Jackson again and again dashed water in
his face. It was only a question of how
nmny lengths Yalo would have at the fin
ish. Suddenly the flajr dropped for Yale
the blues' time was 20:30, just ten sec
onds slower than the record made by the
famous Yale crew of 18SS.
Just as the finish flas fell and Tale's
pen stopped rowing:, Daly, in the Yale
boat, dropped limp over the Bide of the
Â¦phfelL It looked as though he would fall
overboard before Daly, at No. 2, could
tlircw water en him and revive him. He
really rot Into his seat and rowed over
to the launch with the rest of the men.

Another 'strong faction was opposed to making any
declaration at all concerning the Philippines, but
finally the convention agreed to declare: "We are
opposed to the British system of colonization, by
means of which powerful, selfish interests are enabled
to employ the resources of the people to enslave in
ferior races and to enrich themselves. We are in'
favor of true American expansion, such as untier
Democratic control has been achieved in the past,
and by means of which vast territories have been
dedicated forever to equality and freedom. We,
therefore, denounce the various measures adopted
by the Republicans for the government of the Phil
ippines as monopolistic and autocratic and danger
ous to liberty at home as well as liberty abroad."
Up to this time the fashioning of the new planks
has been carried out with trembling hands amid dis
cords and faction fights in almost every State. In
Illinois, for example, a- faction of the convention was
in favor of adopting a platform declaring adherence
"to the fundamental principles of the Democratic
party as laid down in the Declaration of Indepen
dence, the constitution of the United States and our
last national convention." The majority of the
convention refused to accept that declaration and
amended it by substituting "past conventions" in
stead of the last convention!
DEMOCRATIC State platforms adopted this
year are more than usually interesting, inas
much as it has devolved upon the State con
ventions to formulate the policy of the party, upon
new issues. The complete collapse of Bryan's pres
tige and the impossibility of making any further con
test on the silver question render it expedient to
reaffirm the last national platform of the party:
A new platform is therefore necessary, and as the
party leaders in Congress have not formulated one,
nor shaped an issue to submit to the people, the task
of hewing new planks has fallen to the lot of the State'

PERSONAL MENTION.
The New York^stage is to be elevated at last. The
Actors' Church Alliance in that city has organized
Bible classes for chorus girls of the comic operas,
and the stage is to be used Sunday afternoons for
class purposes. One of the promoters of the move
ment gives a curious reason for it. He is quoted as
saying: "Many of the chorus girls come from Bos
ton and they find it hard to make church affiliations
in New York."
For the direction taken by his metaphor Mr.
Bryan is responsible. He concludes that as long as
Mr. Cleveland is seen and heard at Democratic gath-.
erings there can be no harmony. This conclusion is
right in line with Bryanism. Cleveland represents
the only successes of the party since the Civil War.
Bryan represents the worst defeats in its history, and
he prefers defeat and virtue to the stagnant pools of
victory. Republicans approve of Mr. Bryan and his
green scum and malaria ideas.
Mr. Bryan then reaches back into classic history
and brings forward that unpleasant affair in the
family of the late Mr. Virginius of Rome in order
that he may accuse Cleveland of etabbing the Demo
cratic party to prevent its return to virtue. From
all this the public is left to infer that Democracy
strayed from the path of virtue by succeeding at the
polls and getting the power to establish an ague
breeding pond which it passed off on the people as
a national administration. In this view of it the way
to keep that party virtuous is by keeping it out of
power. So, when the sleuth of logic is turned loose
on the tracks of Mr. Bryan's figure of speech the
conclusion captured is that the Republican party is
doing reform work of the highest character by
keeping Democracy in the Magdalen asylum of de
feat.
ministration to do the stunt of a stagnant pool, B but"
to add to this the emission of foul' vapors is trying to
the patience of the Board of Health.
Mr. Cleveland's speech is as keen a piece of de
scriptive sarcasm as appears in American politics. It
hit its mark,' out in Lincoln, and Mr. Bryan claps
his hand on the place where he is hurt and screams
with anger. He introduces some new metaphors into
political discussion by describing Cleveland's admin
istration as "a stagnant pool, from whose waters, foul
vapors rose, poisonous to those who lingered near."
That is neat, if nasty. It is bad enough for an ad-
MR. BRYAN follows Major Watterson in de
nunciation of Mr. Cleveland, his speech, his
two administrations and all his ways and
works. Mr. Bryan has reached that stage of decline
where he is no longer visible to the public unless he
stands on something. This is the stage that follows
after the plan of keeping in sight by jumping up and
down. He has practiced that method until people
looked the other way when he bobbed up, and now
he has to wait until somebody like Mr. Cleveland,
who commands public attention, says something or
does something, -when he jumps on to him and makes
snoots in the public eye. â¢ .
Of course the regulation of the sale of fireworks
is but a small part of the general work of prepara
tion for the day. The Fourth of j July finds the East
parched and dry. A wooden building is hardly bet
ter than so much tinder. Fires are easily started in
such an- atmosphere, and when once started they
spread rapidly! We have no such dangers in this
city. We have neither- the dry air nor the inflam
mable timber. Most of our buildings are con
structed of redwood and burn so slowly that there is
comparatively little danger of any great conflagra
tion. Nevertheless, there. is always some, and it will
be worth our while to guard against it. The Fire
Department and the police of course always take
precautions and do extra duty on that day, but the
whole task of guarding against danger should not
be left to them. With us, as with the East, it. is
time to begin to think of making our preparations
to celebrate the Fourth in such a way that the gen
eral joy will not be marred by any serious accident,
disaster or loss. . ' â¢Â¦-,'_â¢
We have ne'ver suffered the disastrous fires that
have taught the East to watch the coming and the
going of the* Fourth" of ''July with airhoist as much'
anxiety as patriotism, i Nevertheless, we have had
here and there' throughout the State some lessons
that were costly. It is therefore worth our while to
follow the example, of the Eastern cities in that re
gard and look out a little as to what is likely to hap
pen if we are too careless in our manner of celebra
tion.
.-It has been decided by the officials of New York
that the rules relating to the sale of fireworks shall
be enforced this year not only in the city proper but
throughout the whole area of Greater ' New York.
Under the rules no fireworks can be offered for sale
in frame buildings within the fire limits, nor in such
buildings outside the fire limits unless isolated from
other structures, and in no case shall more than one
permit be granted to a block. As the rule cuts off a,
business that has been profitable in Brooklyn and
other boroughs now grouped with the big city a
good deal of opposition to it has been manifest, but
public opinion seems to sustain the action of the
authorities '
AT this season of the year the larger cities of
the East begin to make ready for the. Fourth
of July. Their preparations are not so much
in the way of providing for the celebration as making
provisions and adopting safeguards against the prob
abilities of disaster. Ample experience has taught
the people of that, section -of the Union that the
small boy with firecrackers is Â¦ likely to make the
glorious Independence day an occasion of trouble
that may amount to calamity.
HARMONY RAMPANT.
STANDING ON GUARD. /
The local Board of. Education is at last engaged in,
a surprising endeavor to perform a genuine public
service. The board is rescinding its rules for the ap
pointment of teachers as worse than useless. It is re
modeling its scheme of instruction and displaying
generally a deep seated conviction of the unworth of
its own principles of educational policy. There ap
pears to.be some congratulation" in 'the fact that any
new rules which the board may adopt cannot be
worse than the old.'
The committee then laid over tempora
rily all applications for street railway
privileges.
The committee also reported In favor of
the passage of two ordinances relative to
the maintenance of signs, as ,the present
ordinance has been found-to be imprac
ticable. - .
"We will file a proposition next Mon
day," said Newhall, "in which we will of
fer to sell our property to the. city. This
is in response to- the resolution of the
board soliciting offers from existing street
railroads in connection with -the acquisi
tion of the Geary-street road by the mu
nicipality. We do not wish to withdraw
our application, as it was made In good
faith, and we propose to build the road if
we secure the franchise."
, The committee, after a hurried consul
tation, decided' to recommend that the
United Railroads be granted leave by the
board to withdraw the applications with
out prejudice. Then Goerge A. Newhall,
president of the Presidio and Ferries
Railroad, made his offer to sell the road
to the city.
"These applications were filed by our
predecessor,' the Market-street Railway
Company, without our consent," said To
bln.. "In good faith we felt compelled to
ask the board that they be granted. In
view of the fact that municipal ownership
is the end in view at' the present time we
desire to withdraw all the applications.
Had we been consulted in the first place
the petitions would never have been filed.
We acted later at the request of property
owners who desire the service of the new
lines. We now formally ask permission
to withdraw our applications without pre
judice. Regarding the city's request that
we grant it the use of five blocks on Mar
ket street, consider that proposition at
an end, owing to our withdrawing the pe
titions." ' \ '
': The cause of the withdrawal of the pe
titions by the United Railroads lies in the
fact that the committee has "all along
tacitly imposed a condition that in return
for the franchises asked for the corpora-^
tion should concede to the city the right
to use five blocks on Market street' to
connect with the proposed municipal road
on Geary street. , No satisfactory answer
could be obtained from $he United Rail-r
roads a.nd it was plain that its directors
had not the slightest intention to make
any concession to the city or to comply
with what they termed an onerous con
dition. This was, demonstrated when-Jo
seph S. Tobin, attorney for the big cor
poration, asked leave to withdraw the pe
titions.
. The second surprise was -the offer of
George A. Newhall, president of the Pre
&idio and Ferries Railway Company, to
sell the Union-street road and its
tranches to the city. The last offer will
be v formally made next Monday.
Two surprises were sprung at yester
day's meeting of the. Supervisors' Street
Committee. The first was the formal ap
plication of the United Railroads, as suc
cessor to the Market-street Railway Com'
pany, to withdraw the applications of the
last named corporation for a grant of
franchises for roads covering nearly all
streets not controlled at present by the
monopoly. . . : â¢ '

each carried bouquets of white lilies sent

ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH was
crowded with friends and relatives
of Miss Alma Beatty, the charming
daughter of Chief Justice William
( ; A. Beatty of. . the State Supreme
Court, and Brooke Maynard Wright, a
promising attorney of this city, who were
united in marriage last night. The in
terior of the sacred edifice was beautifully
decorated for. the occasion.
The method he has chosen is that of the juggler.
He has gone as far as possible from his- friend the
Warden, after the two had investigated each other,
and away in San Pedro stands with a fork in his
mouth to catch the turnip, reputation, which he ex
pects the Warden to toss down to him.
All this the Governor has miserably failed to com
prehend. No sooner was "the dirtiness at the prison
disclosed than. he jumped into it up to his neck. Then,
realizing that it had damaged him, he seeks repair.
With the offenses of Warden Aguirre it is totally
different. They are public offenses, which the Gov
ernor of California cannot condone, compound nor
compromise. They are against the people.
Mr. Gage, might wink at the peccadilloes of his
friend Aguirre, as men do wink at those things and
will, world without end. But the Governor of Cali
fornia cannot wink at the act of the Warden' in mak
ing by prison labor and perhaps material not his own
gifts of luxury for a scarlet woman. Nor can one
official overlook in the other the manipulation of
accounts, forging of bills and corruption of public
records beyond recognition for what the law intends
they should be.
The Governor has throughout the affair acted as
if his relation were that of a private individual, with
no element in it beyond his private will, wish and
preference. As an individual he may overlook what
he pleases in his friend. Martin Aguirre may spit in
the face of his friend Henry T. Gage, who may-wipe,,
it off with his coat tail, if he choose, and forgive the
expectorant attention of his friend. The two may
quarrel,' quit "and make up, and it concerns none but
themselves.
The Governorship cf California is not a personal
possession. It is an official trust. The Governor,
as a private individual, could not procure the ap
pointment of Aguirre to the wardensh.ip, no matter
how close and affectionate, their friendship. He did
that as Governor. The relation of private friend
ship ceased when thek entered into official relations
with each other. Thejvwere the holders of public
trusteeships, and their friendship became official en
tirely. Their private friendship was subject to rup
ture by the violation of the conditions upon which
it existed. A breach of friendly faith, trading on
personal credit, abuse of confidence, an act of dis
honor, would dissolve personal friendship. The offi
cial relation of friendship is based solely upon fidel
ity to the public trust, held and administered for the
people. Not the individuals Gage and Aguirre are
concerned at all, but the public officials, the Gov
ernor of California and the Warden of San Quentin
prison.
Just, why he injected himself into this prison scan
dal at all no one can find out. After everything on
which he bases his suit had been published, he . d.e
clared in an authorized interview published in his
Los Angeles official organ that it did not affect him,
that he was not attacked, but that the impact of the
exposure fell upon the Warden, in whom he ex
pressed the greatest confidence. From the point of
view taken in that interview it was plainly the duty
of the Governor to at once request the Prison Di
rectors to make an. investigation of the prison and its
management by Warden Aguirre, to the end that
that officer might be vindicated if deserving of the
confidence the Governor had in him, or condemned
if guilty and outlawed from that confidence.
All fair-minded men see at once that if he heartily*
desired to be shown blameless and abused he would
have sought the most prompt and convenient means
to that end. Had he done so, and, as the law per
mits, brought his criminal suit at a point convenient
to the scene of the alleged offense and accessible
readily to the evidence by which he must be justified
or condemned, the examination would now be far
under way, and the people would be getting the facts,
judicially heard and sifted. ;Vrr
. . . . ,
rnpHE Governor of California is a juggler of no
I mean attainments in some branches of the
'Â¦Â¦*Â¦ business. But there are some things' that can
not be juggled. Among these is his pretense of a
fervid desire to be vindicated in the San Quentin
matter, and his flight to the* v judicial wilderness of
San Pedro in search of it.

SNAILSâ M. H., City. One of thfe best
methods of getting rid of snails that In
fest - a flower - garden is . to - put cabbage
leaves at dusk In the places where they
are most, and in the morning before sun
rise turn the leaves and the snails will be
found clinging to the inside of the leaves.
It is then an easy matter to destroy
them.
That is the best Democracy has done in platform
making thus far. There is a chance for the Democ
racy of California to distinguish itself.
The South Carolina platform is perhaps the best
of all. -At any rate it is the only one that has. been
approved outside the convention that adopted it.
The approval was given by \. the Democratic
convention in Indiana, which also adopted it.
It declares: "The Filipinos cannot be citizens with
out endangering our civilization; they cannot be
subjects without imperiling. our form of government;
and as we are not willing to surrender our civilization
or to convert the republic into an empire, we favor
an immediate declaration of the nation's purpose to
give the Filipinos, first, a stable form of govern
ment; second, independence, and, third, protection
from outside interference." ;
The Oregon Democrats said: ;: "We believe that
the true policy is to prepare the people of those isl
ands (the Philippines) for self-government as speed
ily as possible,, and when so prepared, to grant them
independence, retaining such coaling stations and
ports as may be' necessary to -protect those islands
from foreign interference "and to maintain our trade
relations in the Orient:"
That plarjk makes a showing of a policy, and while
it lacks definiteness it is at least intelligible. , The
Filipinos are to be permitted to establish a govern
mentf'when peace is restored," and they are to be
given independence when their government becomes
"stable." Such propositions may be vague, but they
are preferable to the, Illinois plan of merely de
nouncing every thing, the Republicans have done.
' The Kansas Democrats perpetrated something like
a joke in declaring*: '^"We indorse the poÂ§ition s taken
by- the Democratic of the National Con
gress with respect to the duty of the Government of
the United States toward the Philippine Islands and
their people." The humor of. the declaration lies in
the fact that the .Democrats,. of Congress took no
position on the subject, and their views range all the
way from one extreme to' the other. --
once announce. to'; the^people ;of the Philippines that
when peace is restored they shall be allowed to es
tablish ? government of their own, and that \yhen
such stable government is established they shalFbe
given their independence:"

u S Â£' t l, JO *iÂ®'JW G 26 --A-fine automobile
belonging to Millionaire C. A. Baldwin of
Cupertino was stolen last night and mali
ciously wrecked. The carriage house had
been broken into, the machine taken and
used and then sent racing into a fence at
full speed on the road between Baldwin's
ranch and Santa Clara. The machine was
one of the I finest on the coast and was
imported ffcom France at a cost of several
thousand dollars. Â¦ '
Baldwin lost no time in getting into
communication with the police about the
bay, and he hopes to recover the machine,
unless the thief shall get out of the State
The, loser Bays the, auto is a specially
built mountain climber.
The Oakland police were advised of the
theft of the machine- to-day, being re
quested by Baldwin to watch diligently
for the fugitive "chug chug" and the
burglarious chauffeur, who is cupposed
to be headed for this city.
According to. the 'mobile owner's com
plaint, he was awakened during the night
at his country residence by a suspicious
noise in the automobile house. Going to
his bedroom window, he was almost
paralyzed by the sight of his valuable
machine speeding down the highway it
disappeared northward. The owner pur
sued his investigations, and discovered
that the thief had picked the lock on tho
barn door and was truly an up-to-date
thief, for the 'mobile was gone sure
enough. . :
The man who stole a red hot stove
would turn green with envy if he could
hear the story of the burglar who pur
loined a $1200 automobile from C. A. Bald
win of Cupertino, Santa Clara County

MURASKY BREAKS
DIVORCE RECORD
Severs Bonds of Six
Unhappy Couples in
Sixty Minutes.
Six divorces in sixty minutes is now
the record at the City Hall. It is held
by Judge Murasky, who,, between â¢ the
hours of 11 and 12 yesterday sev
ered the bonds uniting twelve unhappy
husbands and wives, and made them free
to try once, again a voyage on the some
times stormy matrimonial sea. The
grounds on which the divorces were
granted were desertion and neglect, the
charge of desertion being made by the
husbands, and three wives pleaded.ne
glect.
Divorces on the first mentioned ground
were granted to Christian F. Larscn from
Nellie A. Larsen, Frederick R. Collins
from Louise M. Collins and Charles H.
Devoll from Beatrice J. Devoll.
Â¦ The charge of neglect waa the means
of freeing Athena Constantine from Cos
ma Constantine, Ella Pepperdlne from
Silas M. Pepperdine and Juliette Roberts
from Eugene Roberts. â¢ . .
Judge Hebbard granted Harry J. Hutt
a divorce from Emma A. Hutt yesterday.
. Judge Sloss made an order directing W.
F. Hopkins of the Hopkins Investment
Company to pay to Ida W. Hopkins, who
is suing him for divorce, $100 a montn
alimony pending the result of the suit.
The order also provides for the payment
by Hopkins of $100 counsel fees and $25
costs. .
J. M. Wallace, who alleges that she
was deserted by E. C. Wallace last June,
filed a suit for divorce yesterday. They
were married at San Jose in August, 1888.
FOUR OF THE OFFICERS OF THE DRAMATIC ORDER OF THE KHOR-*
ASSAN, KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS, WHO WlfcL TAKE PART IN THE
CEREMONIES NEXT AUGUST.
"Very well," said the court, "vou can
have until July 16 to prepare your fur
ther evidence." * Â¦ â¢ ,
Â¦ "If the court pleases," said Savage "I
can provide further evidence. I would
like- to have leave to amend my com
plaint. These so-called, friends of Mrs
Anthony seem to be anxious to force me
to extremes. It seems to me that the
condition of this couple at present is due
to meddlers." ;
"He comes here upon his release be
fore a year is up, visits her and on the
very day the year is up brings a suit
for divorce. I fall to see how, under the
laws pf this State, you have proved de
sertion. I do not know that Mrs. An
thony's mind is unsound. The mere fact
that she visited me and told me she did
not wish to contest the suit is not proof
that she is insane, and I do not think her
refusal to appear gives you a right to a
decree by ' default. I think there are
many divorces granted I by default that
would not be granted were opportunity
to investigate offered."
VISITS -HIS WIFE.
Attorney Savage rested his case upon
the conclusion of Mrs. -Men-Ufa testi
mony, saying to the court:
"I think we have provided prima facie
evidence of desertion, your Honor."
"I don't think so," responded Judge
Hebbard. "As near as I can make out
this man goes to the steamer to see his
wife start for this country with his chil
dren, their destination being hia sister's
home in this city. He insists upon pay
ing their passage>-He Is afterward ar
rested on a, charge of treason and is only
saved from death through his wife's ef
forts and money.
"Why are they there?"
"Well, it is the best place for them.
My brother and .his wife were always
having trouble at my house and I sent
them there." \
HAD FBEQUENT BOWS.
"Where are the Anthony children
Mrs. Merritt?" asked Attorney Savage
"They are with my mother in Sonoma
County."
Anthony also came to this city after
his release and wnile here frequently
visited his wife and children at Mrs.
Merritt's home, where Mrs. Anthony had
returned after securing the interference
of 1 the United States Government in her
husband's behalf.
The suit for divorce was brought after
he had taken his wife to the hospital.
Mrs. Merritt's testimony was corrobor
ative of that of her brother, in so much
as it referred to the visits of the doctor
to his wife, and the efforts of Mrs. An
thony to save her husband from the
death of a spy. She said Mrs. Anthony
received several letters from Anthony
while he was in the land of the Boers.
"What effect had these Ietter3 on Mrs.
Anthony?" she was asked.
"She was always sick after she got
them," replied Mrs. Merritt.
"Do you know what they contained?"
"No, I do not She very often read a
few sentences-from them to me, and on one
occasion tore a letter up and thew it
into the fire. She always got angry when
reading her letters." â¢
He admitted that Mrs. Anthony spent
her own money in her efforts -to save
him, finally succeeding, and returned to
this city.
USED HEB. OWN MONEY.
Continuing, Anthony told how his wif3
left him in South Africa, admitting that
he partly paid her fare, and how he went
to the steamer to see her off. She came
to this city and took up her residence
v;Ith his sister, remaining there all the
time, except when she went to Washing
ten to save his life, he having been ar
rested on a charge of treason by the Brit
ish and sentenced to be shot.
The strange part of the entire affair is
that Mrs. Anthony visited Judge Hebbard
Wednesday and informed him that she
did not. wish, to contest Anthony's suit
and appeared perfectly willing to allow
Anthony to obtain a decree by default.
This action on the part of Mrs. Anthony
led Judge Hebbard to believe that there
was something queer about the proceed
ii gs and in consequence he refused to
grant the decree on the testimony offered.
Dr. Anthony was the tirst witness ex
amined. He denied using force in taking
his wife to the sanitarium, and in expla
nation said: "I took my wife to thq sani
tarium because she was suffering from
nervous prostration some time before the
occasion mentioned by her friends. She
ts-caped from there and came to the home
of my sister, Mrs. J. T. Mer
ritt, where I and our two chil
dren were residing, and I could do noth
ing else but take her back to the sanita
rium, as she frightened the children. 1
used no force."
SEES JUDGE HEBBAHD.
Pr. Richard S. Anthony of South African
fame failed to prove in Judge Hebbard's
court yesterday that his i wife, Christina
J. Anthony, had deserted him and the di
vorce proceedings brought by him were
pyt over until July 16 to enable his attor
neys to produce other evidence, which
they claim they are able to do.
The case is an interesting one, owing to.
the prominence of the couple and the'sen
sational charges made by several friends
of -Mrs. Anthony, who accuse the doctor
of attempting to get rid of his wife by
confining her in a sanitarium.. Affidavits
to this r effect were made by D. J. 3.
Michau, Mrs. Marie Michau and Dr.
Frederick L.utz. These affiants averred
that the efforts of Anthony to secure a
divorce constituted a deep-laid scheme
avid that his wife's confinement in a pan
itarium was but part of the plot. Mrs.
Anthony, they said, when they saw her at
the local branch of the St. Helena Sani
tarium, whither she had been taken by
Anthony, was v prostrated and very ner
vous as the result of her husband's treat
ment. She told them at that time, they
said, that her husband had used force in
bringing her there, and told her that he
Intended keeping her in confinement for
six months. ,

Weather Report
â¢â¢The weather hae bwn favorable for fruit
c.i a.11 kinds, and the only complaints this week
are from Douglas County, where It is re
ported that peaches are dropping badly. Straw
berry shipments from Hood River have nearly
ended."
"Correspondents generally report -that while
the crops have made rapid advancement and
have not yet been injured by drought, more
rain is needed, and the indications are that
tie showers in the Willamette Valley, which
began Monday (after most of the correspond
ents had mailed their reports), will spread to
the eastern sections of the State by Tuesday,
and be of great benefit to spring grain and
ail late crops.
"Fall v.heat continues filling nicely and the
bulk of the crop is now too far advanced to
be injured by hot winds. Spring-sown grain
is maktr.g excellent progress. The grain n.phis
ie reported as having done some injury to fall
wheat in portions of Linn County, but all
crope Â£O far this year have been unusually
free from insect peets. Oats are heading rather
short in some sections of the Willamette Val
ley. Barley is beginning to ripen â¢ and turn
yellow.
"Thp first crop of alfalfa has been harvested
and the second crop is growing nicely. A
large amount of clover wac cut and safely se
cured during the week. Pastures and range
eras* arÂ» drying up, but the condition of stock
is excellent. Corn, hops, potatoes, onions,
gardens and cngar be*tÂ« continue doincr welL.

NEW YORK, June 26. â To-day's market was
still duller than that of yesterday, and except
for the large dealings In St. Paul and the con
siderable activity in Missouri Pacific and
Amalgamated there was almost nothing worthy
of note. The approach of the month's end,
which Â¦ is also the end of the fiscal year Tor
many corporations, and the extra requirements
upon the money market incident to the period
were undoubtedly an Important factor in re
pressing activity. The Stock Exchange cus
tom is for loans made on Friday to carry over
until Monday, so that to-morrow is looked for
ward to with some solicitude. Â¦ The call money
market was quite active to-day, but was free
from flurry and what was regarded with still
greater sati traction, foreign exchange receded
a fraction. Bankers' loan bills were In the
market thus replenishing the supply, while the
holiday in London and the cessation of the
dribbling liquidation of stocks from that source
lightened the demand for exchange.' The fear
of gold withdrawals was thus removed. Al
though the London market was closed the en
couraging news regarding the condition of the
King of England has some influence In keep
ing the local market firm. The feature of the
day was the demand for St. Paul, resulting in
a rise of nearly 2. The movement was osten
sibly based on the good reports of ' spring
| wheat prospects. The buying was attributed
Â¦ to the Western speculative element, but there
were. Indications of some further diversity In
the sources of buying. ' The fact that a full
supply of preliminary literature was in circu
lation this morning indicated that the move
ment was under professional -guidance. - St.
Paul was the only sustaining force of the mar
ket, although there was a collateral movement
in Union Pacific The contract of the Penn
sylvania Railroad and the Postal Telegraph
Company for the use of the former rights of
way seemrd to have a depressing effect on
some of the stocks In a decline of 1% in
Western Union. There was eome strength in
Amalgamated Copper, without* any news bear
ing on trade conditions to explain the buying
The coalers were almost entirely neglected"
and Reading closed with a small loss. The
coal operators give decided dentals to rumors
of measures of conciliation with the miners
and of arrangements for the early reopening:
cf the mines. The order of the curtailment of
mining in the Western Pennsylvania bitumin
ous region was put in force to-day
The .May statement of earnings of
Erie and New York, Ontario and Western
ehowed. the -. effects of' the strike .In large
decreases in earnings. The. Chesapeake
and Ohio statement for the third week in June
showed the name - force at work- to lessen the
earning power of the Virginia and West Vir
ginia soft 1 , coal carriers. The market closed
dull and heavy, but generally higher than last
night. â¢ - &;'*Â»
The bond market was firm. Total eales, par
value. $2,070,000. United States 3s declined
>i per cent on the last call.

Eggs are weak at a slight decline. Sellers
are offering them freely, and though they make
concessions are unable to sell all their hold

Cheese stands as before,
There is a good demand for store and the
cheaper grades of dairy Butter, both of which
are selling better than the upper grades, as the
bakers are now active buyers, and there are no
other cheap kinds in the market. It is report
ed, however, that some Eastern ladle-packed
will be on the market to-day. The range in
quotations between cheap and fancy Buttsr Is
now remarkably narrow. The market Is weak,
as receipts continue heavy and stocks are lib
eral. Storing is still being resorted to to keep
dewn the surplus.

CHICAGO, June 26. â Wheat had a number of
bearish influences early in liberal . Northwest
ern receipts, new wheat "coming into the, mar-'
ket and ' favorable v weather V for harvesting.
Added â¢ to this was j the absence of trading for
the rest of the r week In the English : markets.

September held up better than July. Both op
tions started %@%c lower, July at 73%@73%c
and getting down to 73c, and September selling
to,71%c. .After the bears had gotten fairly in
the trading led by some selling by elevator In.
terests, the big corn bulls bought over 1,000,000
bushels of the j September option. Then came
word of rain in the Southwest and grasshop
pers in North Dakota and disappointing thresh
ing returns from Ohio and Indiana. July 6old
to 73%c and September to 72%@72%c. July
closed weak, .% c lower at 73\ic and September
firm, %@%c higher at 72%@72>4c. Traders
credit the mixed conditions of the wheat pit to
manipulation. .-..
Corn had an active, heavy trade, with the
greater interest centered in September. There
was liberal buying of this option by the bulls
after an early break and prices advanced sharp
ly. There, was not much in the way of news.

CLIMATE OP SITKA
SHOWS QUEEB CHANGE
SEATTLE, Wash., June 26.â On June 21
the thermometer at Sitka registered 113
deprees. Never, the oldest Russian inhabi
tants say, has such heat been experienced
Jn the supposedly frigid climate of Alas
ka. The weather, of the entire preceding
Â¦week had been unusually warm, but the
maximum vas reached on the 21st. The
old rssidents say the climate at Sltka has
l-een gradually growing warmer for-tha
past twenty-five years. Each . summer
there appears to be less rain and the win
ter seasons are correspondingly milder.
Supreme Court Calendar Changed.
The Supreme Court has decided to con
tinue its calendar until August 11, in
stead of July 23, as previously announced.
The change has been . made in order to
Â£ive Justices and attorneys a better op
portunity to take a summer vacation.
The members of the Gage-Kevane-Agulr
re machine continue to receive the most
discouraging news from the interior. The
latest Intelligence .of a depressing nature
came from Sonoma County to the push
camp. ; Recent efforts to- awaken a little
enthusiasm In that county for Gage's
candidacy utterly failed. There are many
indications that the Republicans of North
ern California, following the example of
San Joaquin Valley Republicans, will send
to the State convention independent citi
zens of high character, who will not take
orders from the machine managers.
In Kern County strenuous exertions
were put forward to establish a Gage
club. After weeks of rallying and round
ing: up, it was found Impossible to get 'a
hundred voters into the camp.
The Republican County Committee of
San Francisco, which -was created by the
convention that nominated Wells for
Mayor and Fisk for District Attorney,
was counted on as an organization which
might be induced to take up the Gage
fight, but the committee practically
throws up the sponge and declares Gage
a beaten candidate. No doubt the ma
chine henchmen will resort to all kinds of
strategy to get a few Gage men on the
various Assembly district tickets, but the
voters will carefully scrutinize all the
names proposed and thus Identify the un
der-cover Gagelings. "The Gage cause is
so weak In San Francisco that his polit
ical advisers have not the courage to put
forward a straight-out Gage delegate
ticket in any district of the city. It is be
coming obvious to the leaders of the ma
chine forces that the people of California
will not tolerate an extension of the Gage-
Kevane-Aguirre administration.

SEDRO "WOOLLEY. Wash., June 26.â
As the time draws near for the San Fran
cisco officer to arrive the man Bennett
grows uneasy. "When a policeman entered
his cell this morning to conduct him to a
restaurant for breakfast Bennett re
marked that he had no appetite and did
not care to go to eat. He complained
that the people stared at him too much
and for that reason he preferred not to be
seen on the street. He has appeared
v/orse and cast down during the day and
refused to talk or answer any questions.
Yesterday his demeanor was very differ-.
ent_ He talked and joked with the jailor
and the reporters and evinced no feel
ing whatever when the warrant charging
him with the murder of Nora Fuller was
read to him. In the loneliness of his cell
Bennett is evidently doing some deep
thinking and frequently remarks that he
â¢wishes he had not made a fool of himself.
He inquires as to the probable time of the
arrival of the San Francisco detective and
eaid to an officer to-day, "Well, if that
'Frisco cop don't know me, my conscience
will be clear any way, for I'll know I did
ray duty."
Whenever Bennett says anything about
the case he reiterates his former remarks
and Is positive In his statements that he
knows ; all' about " the Â¦ murder and that
when he iells his story in court people
high in San Francisco society circles will
be implicated. He claims to possess- a
partly-used meal ticket on the"8an Fran
cisco restaurant outside of which "he met
and became acquainted with Miss Fuller,.
but in spite of all persuasion he refuses
to show it. Yesterday Bennett appeared
very anxious to employ legal talent to re
sist extradition but to-day he said he
Â¦would make no tight but would go back
to the scene of his alleged crirÂ»e. The
opinion Is gaining gropnd here that the
man is either crazy or working for noto
riety. Detective Gibson is expected here
early to-morrow.

BENNETT NOW DECLINES
TO ANSWEB. QUESTIONS
Martin Kelly proceeded to enlighten the
meeting as to- the numerical strength of
the Fourth Congressional District com
mittee, appointed by the State convention
held at Santa Cruz. Chairman Riordan
thought that Kelly's information was not
of much value in guiding- the committee
on the matter of apportionment of dele
gates to the local convention.
The question of apportionment of dele
gates was not decided and the commit
tee having the matter in charge was
given further time to report.
, Resolutions that a petition be filed with
the Registrar calling for an official place
on the ballot for the primary election,
and that each member of the County
Committee be urged to use every effort
to secure registration of Republican
voters, were adopted. â¢Â¦Â¦-..â¢
The meeting adjourned to meet again
on Monday evening next at ~ the same
hall.
The committee suggested the formation
of Republican clubs in each Assembly
district of the city, to be maintained ' as
Independent organizations; that each club
shall nominate and select its own dele
gates to the convention, and that the
aelegrates shall remain unpledged. The
report was adopted.
K. M. Buckley, chairman of the com
mittee on apportionment, was not ready
to report and asked for further time. He
said- that the committee was not. quite
sure as to certain legal points.
Chairman Riordan explained that the
question to be decided by the committee
on apportionment was whether the num
ber of delegates to- the local, convention
be the samÂ£ as fixed for the State con
vention by the Republican State Central
Committee, or whether it be doubled.
John S. Partridge favored one set of
delegates for the local convention and an
other set for the State convention. P.
H. Prendergast and M. B. V. Taylor also
favored doubling the apportionment of
delegates. >
Ralph I* Hathorn, chairman of the
committee to draft a plan of permanent
organization, presented a report based on
the lines suggested in the letter men
tioned. The report deplored the dissen
sions In the Republican party of San
Francisco, and said the lack of harmony
was due to petty jealousies, factional dif
ferences ana personal ambitions, and that
there was no reason why the party should
not work as a unit.
The Republican County Committee met
last evening at Shiels Hall, 32 O'Farrell
street, for the purpose of hearing reports
of the various committees recently ap
pointed by Chairman T. D. Rlordan. For
ty-eight members answered the roll call.
The proceedings were monotonous.
Secretary C. McClellan read a communi
cation, signed by J. C. Campbell as chair
man of a recent meeting of Republicans,
recommending to the County Committee
that clubs be formed in each Assembly
district, that should be- dominated by no
one man or set of men or corporation,
and should be absolutely independent.
The communication also suggested that
the mottoes of these clubs should be "no
bossism," "clean politics" and "home
rule. ' The letter was received and placed
on tile.
Miss Clemmons is a familiar figure on
the streets of this city because of her
acentric dress. She. always wears sev
eral strings of large rosary beads around
her waist.
Detective Coleman says Miss Clemmons
has magnificently furnished rooms in
â¢which are an altar and many valuable im
ages. At the front gate of the house she
has an image of the Sacred Heart and
there are rosary beads hanging on the
post.
Yetterday Miss E. M. Clemmons, sister of
Catherine Clemmons, the former actress,
now the wife of Howard Gould, admitted
that the box was her property. She was
seen early yesterday morning by Detec
tivs Coleman to go up to the box and
after hastily scrutinizing the contents
walk up Sutter street. Coleman Im
mediately stepped up to her and requested
that she go to Captain of Detectives Mar
tin and give an explanation of her col
lection of alms in such a peculiar manner.
Miss Cltnimons was very candid with
Captain Martin. She explained to him
that she was anxious to convert all the
Chinese and Japanese boys possible to the
Catholic faith. She said she conducted a
small mission at 660 Pine street, and
though it was not indorsed by Archbishop
Rlordan she would wait on him to-day
and explain her work. She also consent
ed to take the box down.
The owner of the charity box decorated
â¢with rosary beads, a crucifix and an
American lias, and attached to a tele
graph pole at the corner of Sutter and
Kearny streets, has been found. As soon
as the article concerning it appeared in
The Call. Captain Martin detailed Detec
tive Thomas Coleman to investigate.

Children Tell of Father's
ALAMEDA, June 28.â Because she did
not want to frighten her mamma, little
Mamie Perry, who was injured by being
flung from a train this morning, refused
to ride in the city ambulance to her home.
She sat on the seat of the vehicle with the
driver and when a block from her par
ents' house asked that the ambulance be
stppped so ' that she could walk the re
mainder of the way. Her request was
granted and the suffering child, in com
pany with the driver, walked painfully to
the .front- door of her home. Her head
was wrapped in bandages and her body
ached, but she was happy in the thought
that the "ambulance did not "scare
mamm;v" . â¢
Little Mamie lives with her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Perry, at 2530 Bland
ing avenue; She was sent early this morn-
Ing to deliver a quart of milk in the vicin
ity of the Morton-street station." After
doing so she boarded the train going
toward the mole to ride to the pier with
her father, who was on his way to work.
The child left her milk can in the station
house at Morton street, intending to get
it when the train returned. On the return
trip .the train did not stop at Morton street
and Mamie attempted to alight- while It
was under fast headway. She was hurled
to the street and rendered unconscious.
Her scalp was badly lacerated and she
was eut and bruised in numerous places.
After being - carried into a near-by resi
dence and given . treatment, the child TÂ»
galnÂ«d consciousness, told where the lived
and the ambulance was summoned to takÂ«
her there.

O'Connor, .against whom he nursed a
grudge of twenty years' standing be
cause of an imaginary injury, was put
on trial to-day befbre a jury In Judge
Melvin's court, Â¦ where his sanity will be
determined.
â¢The trial of Devine on a charge of in
sanity is a novel proposition. In the case
of the Rev. Charles G. Adams for the
murder of Dr. J. G. .Je.ssup, the former
minister was first tried for homicide, and,
after acquittal, was tried by a jury on
a charge of insanity and^ declared In
sane. In this case the authorities have
decided to first try Devine by a jury to
determine his sanity.
Deputy District Attorney Samuels and
Attorney M. C. Chapman of defendant's
counsel did not haggle much over the
qualifications, and in less than an hour
after beginning this morning they had
the necessary twelve. These were: M.

nesses. She remembered his unannounced
departure for Ireland in 1884, after hav
ing accused hia wife at their then home
in San Pablo of intimacy with O'Connor.
The wife was Jeft destitute, but she man
aged to get funds and follow him and
bring him back to California: She related
Instances of hysterical conduct, and
expressed her unqualified belief in his
insanity.. ... .â¢ .....-â¢
Devine's eldest daughter. Miss Joseph
ine, who teaches school, tola of the insane
delusions her father entertained regard
ing her mother and O'Connor. She said
there was not the slightest suspicion
against either of them. She heard him
say often that he would die 'for O'Connor
some time, and his imaginary enemy's
name was ever on his tongue.
"He thinks he ought to be hanged, fqr
the killing," she said. "He shows no re
morse for the crime. I think he enjoys
the prospect of hanging. He thinks there
is something wrong because he has not
been hanged already." ' ,.
EXPERTS GIVE TESTIMONY.
Dr. A. M. Gardner of the Napa Insane
Hospital, J. W. Â¦ Robertson of the Liver
more Sanitarium, Dr. O. D. Hamlin and
Dr. J. P. Dunn all offered expert testi
mony, all asserting their belief in De
vine's mental incapacity to realize the
enormity of his crime. Â¦
j Jerry Savage and Michael Sullivan, sec
ttion men. who worked under Devlne,' r and
Neal Devine, his son, testified that they
believed him insane. All heard . him
make threats against O'Connor, and' stat
ed that he seemed to be preoccupied at
all times with thoughts, about- the man
he killed after twenty years' delibera
tion.
During the conduct of the case Devine
sat in a chair, apart from his counsel
and spoke not a word. He was more
indifferent of the proceedings than the
most casual spectator in the. courtroom.
At recess his children Â¦ gathered . around
him. but he Â¦was not concerned about the

The public report of the Grand Jury will

these other cases will come up for consid

there were some of the grand jurors who

As Stedman originally made the affida

that Stedman and possibly others would

SACRAMENTO, June 26.â The Ponies
played all around the Senators in this aft
ernoon's game and won easily by a score
of 7 to 3. Stricklett presented a splendid
sample of twirling 1 , but was "poorly sup
ported. He was hit frequently In the first
two innings and the lead made by the
visitors was too great to overcome. Gra
ham 'had his finger split in the third in
ning and retired in favor of Hogan, -who
caught a splendid game, but was inaccu
rate in 5 throwing â¢ to bases. Casey, â¢ the
new acquisition to the Senators, broke in
the game, despite the fact that he had
just come from a fatiguing railroad jour
ney. He showed himself able to deliver
the goods. He is as fast as Mohler and

The sixth . finished the run-getting and
also furnished some excitement. Streib
hit- past first. McCreedie's hit, aided .by
Householder's error, put Strel)? on third.
Bill Devereaux nearly duplicated Cris
tall's smash, but Jackson made a great
run and picked it off the ground. A
moment later, Dunleavy sent both men
in on a clean single to left territory.
Reilly played phenomenal ball at third.
Mohler's work at second was the same
as usual. Gorton shared the honors with
Jackson by robbing Bill Hanlon of a two
bagger in the seventh by a great burst
ol: speed. The score:
Oakland did all its profitable business
in the fifth and sixth. In the fifth, Dun
leavy and Gorton singled and the versa
tile Cristall lined a three cushion drive to
left which scored them both. It was a
peculiar, hit. Jackson was playing in
close and made a run for the ball which
hit a few inches in front of him. It
continued on its meteoric course and
reached the fence. Cristall, tore., around
the bags "and" nearly* made a' borne run
on it, being thrown out a few feet from
the . plate.
Many an Angel made fruitless passes
at 1 the weather yesterday afternoon at
Recreation Park, or else hit the ball and
made a hopeless sprint for the Ilist sack.
Sometimes after landing there on an er
ror or- a free pass, the luckless runner
Â¦waited* vainly for a delivering base hit
Â¦which came not. For nine innlnga. the
muscular lads who are fighting to' uphold
the honor of the South, made many an
agonizing attempt to ride safely on one
of Crlstall's special brand, but Toman
was the sole Angel who was there.
, Toman, like Rip Van Winkle, is a lucky
man. He took on a pained expression in
the third and then sent the ball scurry-
Ing over third base for the only safe
bump made off the mysterious southpaw's
deceptive shooting. Several Angels were
shamefully robbed of hits, but :hat was
not Cristall's fault; it was his clever
support. The game started in a listlfess
way. In the first two innings the lead
ers made five glaring errors, two going
to Cristall. Prospects looked exceedingly
bright ; for several southerners racing
easily to the plate. â¢ That stonewal infield,
Â¦however, always delivered the goods in
the shape of a few timely double plays,
which safely brought Cristall out of some
of the tightest places any pitcher got Into
this season.

promising x the military- authorities to re

He did not appear at the inquest. The
shooting, which occurred near the camp
of the discharged soldiers, created no end
of excitement. The military authorities
seemed disposed to treat the matter light

entirely satisfied with Harris* explanation
of how the shooting occurred, and he in
tends to. hold a more, searching investi
gation into the facts.. Captain Culp, post
surgeon at the Fort McDowell Hospital,
where Beck was taken after much delay,
admitted on the. witness stand that the
wound which caused Beck's death was
not necessarily fatal. He. expressed tho
opinion that the wounded man might have
lived had. he received â¢ medical attention
more promptly. Lieutenant Guittard and
Sergeant James Sweeney, both, of whom
are connected with the post medical de
partment, testified in the same strain.
The Coroner's- jury brought in a verdict
that Beck came to his death from a gun
shot wound at the hands of Louis Harris.
Harris, who is a- member of Company F
Twenty-fifth. Infantry, . is now under ar
rest at the reservation. He will be court
martialed, but the probabilities arc that
he will be acquitted. â¢-.
The deceased was a native of Denmark
aged -43 years. He was Â¦ unmarried and
lived at 848 Folsom street in this city.
Inquiry at Angel Island yesterday after
noon developed the fact that the military
authorities are quite reluctant to discuss
the details â¢ of what some of the officers
choose to term "a bad piece of business."

"There is no reason why the Board of
Education should not increase some sal
aries," said W T ebster in discussing the
matter. "There will be $1,350,000 clear to
expend for the maintenance of schools
next year, and I believe the teachers
should reap the benefit. There never has
been so much money in the school fund
and I certainly will endeaver to have sal
aries raised wherever it may be possi
ble. I would be in favor of raising the
salaries of all teachers, but this will be
impossible with the funds at hand. How
ever, some salaries should be raised, and
I believe the members of the board are in
accord with the plan." -
Superintendent of Schools Webster is
in favor of the plan, and to that end will
introduce at the next meeting of the
board a resolution increasing the salaries
of teachers of the seventh and eighth
grades and principals of the .primary
schools. The resolution also will provide
for higher wages to be paid to Janitors
of school buildings. Webster thinks that
teachers of the eighth grade should re
ceive not Jess than $90 per month, where
they arc now receiving 5S3, and teachers
of the seventh grade, he thinks, should
receive $85 per month. Webster is also
of the opinion that principals of the pri
marj' schools should be increased 'by at
least $10 per month, an.d that the janitors
should have better wages in some in
stances.
There is a movement on . foot in the
Beard of Education to raise the salaries
of some teachers and principals in the
School ' Department. The matter has
been discussed behind closed doors by
the School Directors, but no conclusion
has been arrived at as yet. i '

Solving the ProblemâA
Little History and What
Is Being Done-How
Pommer-Eilers Music
Company Can Afford to
Sell Fine Pianos Cheap'
Other stores at Sacramento;
Portland and Spokane. > -
653 Market street, San Fran-
cisco, Cal.
POMMER-EILERS
MUSIC COMPANY,
If we can't convince you that
it will pay you, and pay you well,
to do business with Pommer-
Eilers Music Co., it must be be-
cause you prefer to disregard
every law of economy and sound
business senseâ which is almost
unthinkable.
We are here to do businessâ
to sell pianosâ and we can af-
ford to meet any reasonable
proposition half way; . we take
used pianos, used organs in ex-
change,' or we let you rent a
brand new pianoâ your pick of
our establishmentâ for a small
sum per month, and at the end
of a week or a month or a year
you can purchase that piano if
it is entirely satisfactory, and we
allow you as part payment on it
what you have paid us for its
rent, less simple interest.
But the fact that we wish
you to thoroughly understand is
this: We can sell better pianos
for less money than any other
house on the Pacific Coast can
afford to do. We are demon-
strating it every day. We demon-
strated it in April and May, when
we sold more pianos and organs
than any other piano house in
the United States did during the
same time. If we could not sell
pianosâbetter pianosâ for less
money than other houses do, we
could not have attained this re-
markable record. You know
that. It is simply common sense.
LET US HAVE IT UNDERSTOOD
We want to have a word with
the man or woman who is on the
lookout for a first-class piano-
and who does not want to pay
more for it than it is really
worth. We know a few things
about buying and selling pianos.
We have made it our business for
years to find them out. We know
that/the piano business has been
run in an old-fogyish sort of
way â pianos selling foÂ£ twice
and nearly three times what
they were worth? simply because
dealers bought pianos as if they
were white elephants. They
were afraid. Now right from
the start we concluded that the
piano business could be run as
any other modern business is.
That meant up-to-date methods
âa revolution in the business.
Instead of buying a piano here
and one there, we ordered
pianos in carload lots, and we
made this end of the business in
the way of selling facilities cor-
respond to our extensive orders.
We reduced prices so much that
"old school" dealers gasped, and
we adopted such an easy pay-
ment plan that any one in very
moderate circumstances can get
a first-class piano from us and
not be in the least inconven-
ienced financially^:
If you Have a piano â have an
old one that you would like to
exchange for a new one, or any-
thing of that kindâ you wil! be
interested in what we have to
say here. If you may need a
Â¦piano .this will interest you. If
you don't care for music, quit
reading now.

It costs as much to make a $Z50 shoe as a "
$3^50, by the same process*
It costs as much to retail iU
It costs more\to finish it, so that ft will
resembfe some inferior $3*50 shoes!
The dollar difference thus comes out of the...
leather-out of the very life of the shoe* :/ r \
No shoe which sells for less than $3*50
can posses wear enough to justify the cost of
fine finish*
â¢ No $3.50 shoe,-4>ut the REGAL,-can have
a wire-wear "Live Oak sole" and a "King
G&" upper-because no other is sold direct
from ** Tannery to Consumer " with only one
profit from.the Maker to yotu
Stylo Book tolls man.
Good enough
for anybody!
