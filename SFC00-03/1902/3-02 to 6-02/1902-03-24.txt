The Daily News remarks that a settlement. would be pos
sible if the Boers were treated like civilized combatants; "but
men do not surrender unconditionally just after taking one of
the enemy's generals and four of his guns."
BRUSSELS, March 24. â The Petit Bleu, referring to
tne arrival at Pretoria of Messrs. Schalk-Burger, Reitz " and
Commandants Meyer and Kreigh, said it believes . that Mr.
Schalk- Burger's move is in response to fresh British. overtures
for peace, made out of gratitude for the release of General
Methuen, and predicts that these overtures will lead to no re
sult unless Boer independence is conceded.
PRETORIA, March 23.â Acting President Schalk-
Burger, F. W. Reitz. ex-Secretary of State for the
Transvaal, and Commandants Lucas Meyer and
Kreigh. with their secretaries and attendants, arrived
here yesterday at 2:04 p. m. on a special train from Balmoral,
ibout fifty miles cast of here. They came into Balmoral undei
a flag of truce.
Upon arriving here Mr. Schalk-Burger and his party drove
immediately to Lord Kitchener's headquarters, where he had
â¢ an interview with the British general. The Boers afterward pro>
cccded to the railroad station and entrained at '5 o'clock for
Kroonstad, whence they will go out under a safe conduct.
For a week past Mr. Schalk-Burger and his colleagues have
been stationed at Rhenostcr Kop, north of Balmoral, where they
have beer, closely pressed by British columns. Dispatch riders
entered Balmoral Friday night and notified the British of the
approach of the party. It is reported that the Boer position at
Rhenoster Kop had become almost hopeless and that Mr.
Schalk-Burger once narrowly escaped capture.
LONDON, March 24. â The news that the wandering
"Boer Government" had entered the British lines is regarded as
having but one meaning, namely, that another movement is be
ing made toward peace. The fact that the censor passed the
news of this movement is accepted as confirmation of this
opinion.
Nothing is actually known here of the intentions of Messrs.
Schalk-Burger, Reitz, Meyer and Kreigh. It is possible they
have sought permission to traverse the British lines in order to
talk with President Steyn and the Boer General Delarey.
Whatever their object, the news has been welcomed in London
as pointing to the possibility of peace.;
Some correspondence which was seized a short" time"ago~
when Mr. Steyn narrowly escaped capture proved that- he and
Mr. Schalk-Burger were anxious to conclude peace. No extrav
agant hopes, however, are being built on the outcome of the
movement of Schalk-Burger and his companions, chiefly because
it is feared that Delarey, in the flush of his recent success, will
refuse to be a party to any negotiations.
The Daily Chronicle, commenting on the absence of Botha
Trom the delegation, suggests that he is standing aside owing to
the failure of his overtures a year ago/and says that all the con
ventions then offered by Lord Kitchener to â¢ Botha having
been annulled, it is highly probable that peace may still be ar
ranged on similar lines, but that the Boers cannot expect more
lenient terms.

few days ago : Dr. Anderson,, resigned- his
position as president 'of [the, local branch
of the", brotherhood. The result is con
siderable gossip in theosophical circles,
and it ; is predicted that this step will
mark the disruption of the brotherhood in
the near future.
The alleged autocratic disposition shown
by Madame Tingley since she took
charge of ' the brotherhood affairs, her
belllgfrcncy and her evident, lack of
knowledge of ordinary business rules,
which, it is said, have involved the broth
erhood in considerable costly litigation,
are said to be responsible for the dissat
isfaction existing among the, cult. So
pronounced has this dislike for the "mas
ter" become that many branches of the
theosophical .societies which joined the
brotherhood at the time the organization
was formed with Madame Tingley as its
head have withdrawn therefrom. Through
the efforts of Dr. Anderson, however, the
local branch remained loyal to the chlef
tess until it becamo evident to Dr. An
derson that forbearance would no longer
be a virtue under the existing condi

.TROUBLE IS DEEP-SEATED.
Dr. Anderson's explanation of the trou
ble shows that It Is deep-seated and that
the very existence of the brotherhood is
now threatened. He said last night' that
he was preparing a statement for dissem
ination' among the Theosophists of the
United States, calling attention, to the
operations of Madame Tlngley and warn
ing them that, radical action must be
taken if the extstence of the. brotherhood
Is. to be assured. He said:
"I have no desire to discuss this matter
at the present time, but I am perfectly
willing to tell why I resigned the presi
dency of the local branch. The opera
tions of .Madame Tlngley have disgusted
me. She has conducted herself in a rrian

The verdict that young Wilcox was guilty
of the murder of Miss Nellie: Â¦ Cropsey
seems to have met popular approval,
though it was considered probable early
yesterday morning that the. jury would
so report. District Attorney Ward said
yesterday he never looked for. any .verdict
other than murder in the second degree.
Lawyer Aydlett for the defense will enter
an appeal on behalf of the prisoner. He
will seek to set aside the verdict on the
ground that it was not consistent with
the evidence brought out -In. the trial.
There is little prospect of the prisoner's
paying the death penalty on the. date set
by Judge Jones. As the Supreme Court
does not meet till next September It is

during the annaul meeting of the

The administration of the hospital as
conducted by the society was fully in
dorsed, though attempts were made by
the Legallet-Chartrey faction to hint at
wrongdoing. Dr. J. E. Artlgues was re
elected by an overwhelming vote as con
sulting physician, while Drs. E. R.
Berges and F. R. Orella were chosen as
city physicians, the later being re-elected.
The Legallet-Chartrey cohorts were de
feated completely, and the reform admin
istration is" likely to hold office for an in
definite period.
*.ie new directors are J. M. Dupas, J.
Bayle, P. Bellegarde, J. A. Bergerot, P.
Berges, J. Bergez, O. Bozio, J. S. Godeau,
J. B. Lacaze, T. Lacoste, E. Messager,
J. B. Pon, G. Pouchon and E. Thlele.
The result of the annual meeting and
the election of officers was a complete in
dorsement of the administration of Presi
dent J. M. Dupas and his ooard and a
defeat of staggering proportions for the
faction headed by ex-Presidents^ A. Le
gallet and Raoul Chartrey.
I>e*>plte every endeavor made by the
Legallet-Chartrey faction to prevent an
election, the voting was proceeded with.
President Dupas and ten of the directors
who ran for re-election will serve for an
other year, and three new directors on
their ticket also were carried to victory.
Legrallet is a chevalier of the French
Legion of Honor and is very proud of
that facL When Bergerot addressed him
by his title and then objected to Legal
let being placed on a certain committee,
the ire of the red-ribboned Gaul was at
the boiling point.
"Why are you constantly digging at
me," cried Legallet. "I have a mind to
â¢lap your face."
Bergerot was equal to the occasion. In
tones that have thrilled many audiences
the attorney said: "Ah! ah! a man who
threatens to slap my face does not turn
his back to me as you do. You are too
much of a coward to slapvmy face, and
if you did, why, I would spit in your
face." ' .
The two men were sitting close to one
another and friends intervened to prevent
a mixup but word ' went around the
French colony last night that a duel can

bers of the society without fierce
debate taking place . . would be un
usual, and the meeting yesterday
was a "hot one" in every respect.
Nearly one thousand members were pres
ent, and at times dozens of speakers were'
trying Ho make themselves heard at the
eame moment, while' President Dupas
rang ! his handbell to quiet the din of
voices. . -
One faction, headed by ex-Presidents
Legallet and Chartrey, tried to postpone
the election of officers, but met with sig
nal defeat. The opposition ticket put up
against the re-election of President Dupas
and ten of his associates did not mate
rialize. Most of the candidates on the op
position declined to run. and but three of
them were left on the official ballot. Two
days ago the three candidates were with
drawn from the contest, and this left
only fourteen names on the ballot. As
fifteen directors had to be elected the Le
grallet-Chartrey faction claimed that no
election could be held.
There was a lively debate over the sub
ject, and Chartrey was the recipient of
yells and groans when he insisted on
speaking after all debate had been closed.
The members voted to go ahead with the
election.
The question of the nurses' training
school was once again brought up. and
Bosquet, who was superintendent of the
French Hospital under Chartrey's presi
dency, wanted the school abolished and
sisters of a religious order installed in
their places. This also met with defeat
after heated argument. .

- WASHINGTON, A March }Â¦ 23.-If the
House doesn't pass the ship subsidy bill
the rivers and harbors bill, carrying ap
propriations aggregating more than $60,
000,000, will be ; defeated In the Senate.
This is the ultimatum of the promoters
of the ship subsidy bill. 1 .
'Senator Frye is chairman of the Senate
Committee on Commerce, of . which Sen
ator'Hanna is : a v member. Their com
bined . influence, assisted by the efforts
of _ other- Senators who are in
sympathy with the ship subsidy bill,
would be sufficient to Insure the death of
the rivers and harbors bill. Hanna is be
lieved to have been responsible for the
defeat of the rivers and harbors bill in
the* closing hours of the last session of
the Fifty-sixth Congress. It has always
been accepted as a fact that he was the
Instigator of the : filibuster conducted by
Senator Carter of Montana.
Frye- declined to have anything to do
with that bill. He would not preside over
the sessions of the Committee on Com
merce while it was being considered and
refused to take charge of it on the floor
of the Seriate.: . â¢â¢ â¢ - Â¦
An organized fight on the rivers and
harbors â¢ bill in the : Senate â¢ would cause
consternation in both sides of the House,
for the pork barrel has been at low tido
for many years. ., Republicans and Demo
crats have struggled manfully and with
out partisan stress- to create a "whopper"
of a .bill Â¦- that would satisfy everybody
who has anything approaching a navi
gable stream in his district. They have
felt sure the bill .would pass the Senate
this year, practically without friction and
that the rewards so long delayed would
be finally distributed. \
j The measure is now before \the House
and. will undoubtedly pass that body.. It
will not be defeated in the Senate without
a vlgiorous, -long-drawn-out .fight,, for
there are Senators who areas much in
terested in .its provisions as are the Rep
resentatives. It was currently reported
in Washington last winter and believed
by many persons that the Southern Sen
ators relinquished their opposition to the
so-called Platt amendments and permitted
their adoption in order to get the rivers
and harbors bill before the Senate. These
were angry because the bill was finally
Â¦defeated?^ ''Â¦â¢"â¢'>â¢'' ;*<â¢'Â« "'-'Â¦Â¦

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON. March 23.
It developed to-day that railroad
interests are seeking to have
passed a bill which will, not only
permit pooling, under restrictions by the
Interstate Commerce Commission,, but
which would permit a union of interests
bo satisfactory to the operators of great
railroads as to. render unnecessary such
a merger as that brought . about by the
Northern Securities Company. It is stated
that if this bill be passed It .will make no
difference whatever to the Great North
ern, and the Northern Pacific interests,
whether Attorney General Knox's Injunc
tion proceedings begun in Minnesota are
decided adversely to the railroads or not.
The big railroad men of the country
have been trying to have ' the President
use his efforts to have the bill passed by
Congress. To obtain his interposition
many visits were paid .to the 'White
House. His visitors pointed out to . the
President that the present interstate com
merce law had been really outgrown by
the country during i the business and in
dustrial evolution, of the last four years.
They held that the enforcement of the
law. against the railroads would In no
sense benefit the shipper nor the country
at large, but would cause business and
financial uncertainty, and might precipi
tate a panic.
President's Characteristic Rebuke.
It is related that during one of these
interviews the president of a Western and
Southern railroad, the stock of which a
few years ' ago was selling at 25 and Is
now at par and a half, was very insistent
in describing/ the iniquitous features of
the interstate law. The President told
him that he would be very glad to meet
the railroad men of the country, with rep
resentatives of the shippers, and perfect
a law upon which all could agree and
which would safeguard every interest and
do injustice to none. He would use his
influence to pass such a law.
The railroad men rejected the proposi
tion, declaring . that the railroad men
wanted no . law at all, or . a law that
should be a dead letter, claiming that the
railroads under their present conservative
management could be absolutely trusted
to oppress no one. -
The President's reply was characteris
tic, . He is reported to have^told the rail
road president that stÂ»eh men as he were
almost entirely responsible for the spread
of the socialistic sentiment in this coun
try.
That ended -the Interview, but there
hSve been others. These were first held
for the purpose *>t asking the President
to keep his hands off the merger effected
by the . Northern Securities Company.
When these efforts failed financial inter
ests from, one end-, of the -country to the
other started a campaign for the purpose
of showing to the President that his pol
icy, if persisted in, would cut him off ab
solutely, from the support of all the vest
ed business interests. -
Threats From Wall Street.
It has been published that J. Plerpont
Morgan has declared himself hostile to
the nomination of Mr. Roosevelt for the
Presidency. Railroad men, stock brokers,
heavy investors In railroad securities al
most without exception took the attitude
that- if Mr. Roosevelt did not change his
policy he would find himself absolutely
witbout-buslnes's support and without any
campaign fund in 1904 should he-be nom
inated. Undoubtedly some influential men
have fully decided to oppose Mr. Roose
velt for nomination and for election:
. These : threats reach the President In
some form almost every hour of the day.
Manifestly -the immediate object In view
is to influence, the Interstate Commerce
Commission in Its injunction proceedings
against the railroads.' ... ;.
MANILA, March 23.â Brigadier GeSerad
George W. Davis, stationed at- Zam
boanga, Island of Mindanao, reports that
a detachment of the signal corps, consist-
Ing of seventeen men, was attacked by
200 Moros near Paran, Mindanao. One
man of the signal corps was killed. The
Moros captured the transportation, of the*
detachment. Including four pack. mules.
The United States transport Buford has
arrived here. She has on board a detach
ment of the Twenty-seventh Infantry, a
squadron of the Eleventh Cavalry and
flity pack mules. - . . . â¢-.
There have been four â¢ more ' cases of
cholera here and two deaths from the
plague are reported. The health authori
ties believe that their rigid precautions
have averted an epidemic. , As General
Chaffee did not want the men In the
Third Infantry to run the risk. of cholera
as a result of contact with the city, that
regiment has already . been taken aboard
the United States transport Grant, which
will sail for San Francisco . one week
ahead of hef^cheduled time.: Five -cases
of cholera have been reported *. from the
provinces.

At this conference General Wood reit
erated again and again, just as he has
done in the. past, the necessity of grant
ing larger tariff concessions to Cuba. than
are contained in the bill now pending in
the Ways and Means Committee.
Postmaster General -Payne was present
at the conference in order -that he. might
become informed of all details of the situ
ation in Cuba,- ,It' was 'his 'first .meeting
with General Wood, -who gave Mr. Payne
important information In. regard to af
fairs on .the island, both social and po
litical.
An informal conference was held at the
White House to-night between the Presi
dent, Secretary Root, Postmaster General
Payne and General Leonard Wood. Cuban
affairs. were very largely, discussed, and
the meeting was only a continuation of
previous conferences on this question.
The establishment of an independent gov
ernment and the "plans to be adopted
therefor were Â« again talked over, but no
decision was reached.. - .
"^ The President, it is said; is -anxious,
above all things, ' to effect a union : of, in
terests between the Secretary, of War and
the lieutenant general . of ; the, army. - He
does not think that this can ever, be done
with General Miles in this po
sition, and he feels that. the<Â£ace should
be -filled by an army officer of -.ability,'
tact and long experience ;who , will work
in harmony with the; administration.
Who this man will be no one is yet able
to tell, but that there- will be a change in
the ottice in a very short time now seems
almost certain.- â¢â¢â¢ . .

One report of the function, after describing with
due lavishness of rhetoric the magnificent. display of"
jewelry and unprecedented toilets gleaming under
the glow of myriad lights, and so forth, says: "At
the drawing : rooms Queen Victoria stood at , one end
of a long line of royalties, beginning with the Prince*
and : Princess of Wales,' and every lady as; she was
presented hadr to! make a courtesy to each, member of
the royal family placed at very short 'intervals; This
awkward. performance is now abolished. > The mem
bers .of the royal family and other members of - the
court- are ; now '" ranged . in a long line behind the
King's ahd Queen's throne chairs. Several yards in
front of the' thrones the King and Queen stood and
those presented bowed to them alone. . This;saved
much time, as did another innovation. ,: To-night
none save Embassadors .and Ministers : shook hands,
whereas all the debutantes used to-do so. 7 'Another
difference, was that . the"^ King and - Queen- remained
throughout, responding to each person presented Â¦
with'a slight bow, while "the line of royalties and
court personages,- ranged - in the 'distance behind,'
stood practically ; motionless ; throughout' the rather
less .than" two hours that .the presentations occupied."

cans is the part taken by.; the ( royal '^ family^ and .the'

DISPATCHES from London giving accounts
of the first'. "court" held by the new King
and Queen were devoted ' largely '. .to the
changes made by the new sovereigns f rom . the cus
toms that prevailed at such functions under the old
Queen. The function was far more brilliant than
anything of the kind in the later; years of Â¦ Victoria,
but as that was a matter of course, not much has
been said of it. The feature of the new function that
most impressed London was the . abolitton of a good
many of the old ceremonial, observances upon which
Victoria insisted, and .the substitution of forms
which relieve the court of a great deal of the former
awkwardness.
THE BURDEN OF ROYALTY.
This reappearance of Bryan as an active cam
paigner for the Presidential' nomination confuses the
plans of the reorganizes and disturbs their calcuia-
In the course of his talk; Bryan undertook to in
itruct Democratic Senators and Representatives how
they should vote'on every important question before)
Congress. About the only issue on which he was not
ready to give advice or .command was -that. of the':
choice of. .chairman of the . Democratic Congressional
campaign committee. On well nigh every other topic
he was free and firm in speaking. He. even tried to Â¦
cheer his despondent followers and told. them: "The
Democratic outlook is good. We have a prospect of
Carrying the next House, and such a victory this fall
would pave the way to triumph in the Presidential
campaign." . . Â¦*.'/ ~- '.-â¢-
During his visit to Washington Bryan received a
good deal of attention, and in commenting upon the
impression made. the Washington correspondent of
the Atlanta Constitution says: "William Jennings
Bryan undoubtedly regards himself still a'Presiden
tial probability. He made this pretty: clear in talks
he had with Democratic: Senators and Representa
tives here to-day; mere, however, by what he did
not say than by^what he did. He also made it clear
that he believes every Democrat in public life either*
reads the Commoner or should do so. To each man
to whom he talked he made some referericc to his
paper." .. â¢ . ",'
While the committeemen who hang around New
York hotels entertain ! such sentiments, Mr." Bryan
continues to take himself quite seriously as the per
petual candidate of his party,. the man whom destiny
has chosen to be the next Democratic President of
the United States. .; Vi'v'A'
-r jr tILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN has been
\/\/ doing a good deal of politics during his lec
Â¦' V ture tour of the Eastern States, and has
thereby greatly disturbed the 'reorganizes. A num
ber of Democratic National Committeemen who
were recently in New York City are reported to have >
been quite frank in avowing their dislike of the situa
tion. Some of them declared Bryan to be a political
nuisance, a man who has outlived his usefulness and
who, being politically dead, ought to stay buried. : It
was also stated by these committeemen that the Bry
anites no longer control the committee, and â¢ that
there would be no large amount of dissatisfaction if
the Bryanite chairman of- the committee, Senator
Jones of Arkansas, were to lose his seat in the Sen
ate and be retired from national politics along with
Bryan himself. : '
TOO MUCH BRYAN.
Modoc County seems determined, like an incor
rigible criminal, to "bear the scarlet badge of shame in
the community of California counties. It appears im
probable that the 7 murderous lynchers of the county
will ever be made to pay the penalty for their heinous
offense.
The situation in California remains .precisely as
for the past year or two, barring the marked influx
of new people and new funds into San Francisco and
the half-dozen counties around the bay. The amount
of new building going on in Sari Francisco is re
markable, as is the large increase in the number of
itÂ« inhabitants, both temporary and permanent. Vast
sums of gold coin are now being released in this city
in payment for the Market-street railroad system and
in the settlement of immense estates; and ; the con
struction of new edifices, and the city. is; enjoying a
commercial â¢ activity highly * gratifying to its ' citizens.
There is not much going on in Wall street just
now. The leading financiers, even those who are at
the head of the enormous combinations of capital,
admit that if left to itself the stock market would go
down, as prices are too high, but they candidly say
that they will not let it go down â that is, until they
see their way to do so without seriously disturbing;
conditions. As they control the situation they can
do as they please. But the country is so prosperous
and so flush with ready money that even under pres
ent conditions if the stock market should go down
general business would probably not be violently
affected. .
* â^ OMMERCIAL reports from all over the
I country indicated a general expansion in
V_^ trade last week. The bank clearings did not
corroborate this, as they showed a loss of 10.4 per
cent from 1901, hence, while the demand for mer
chandise and produce might have, and probably did,
exhibit pronounced improvement, the aggregated
business, counted in dollars and cents, was smaller.
This would seem to show that the improvement was
rather in jobbing and retail quarters than in the
heavier importing and wholesale lines. Be this as' it
may, there was certainly a quickening in distribu
tive trade, while the export demand for wheat was
better than for some time back The recent rains
throughout the winter wheat belt depressed prices to
a point where the European countries could pur^
chase, and the American markets were thereby placed
once more on an exporting basis, a position which
they had been above for months as far as active ship
ping was concerned. That Europe wants our wheat
was shown by her immediate response to the decline,
and sales for foreign shipment during the close of the
week were very large. The other staples also showed
increasing activity. A brisk demand for nails, hard
ware and lumber indicated large building operations,
and Pittsburg reported an enormous demand for
structural' material, especially for office buildings,
railroad enrs and bridges and viaducts. The general
demand for iron and steel, however, is not as ex
cited as last year, and it is expected that by the 1st
of July this industry will have gotten back to normal
conditions as far as prompt deliveries are concerned.
The boot and shoe manufacturers are busy on old
orders, but new business is rather light. An advance
in the wages of cotton operatives has increased the
cost of production and print cloths are. higher,
though Southern cotton centers are reporting dull
ness in the wholesale trade, with slower collections.
Woolens are quiet, though the raw wools are firm
under moderate stocks at Eastern centers. The re
tail business of the country is reported exception
ally fine, and the car famine is now so far relieved
that but little is now heard of that shortage in cars
which hampered trade so seriously for almost *a year
and materially reduced the commercial statistics of
the country. An encouraging feature of the situation
is the decrease in failures, those for the week num
bering 209, against 224 for the corresponding week
last year. . â¢

designed for> the new- battleships of the
United States navy. The Engineer states
that the information . is through the
"courtesy of Admiral Melville, that the
drawings have not been published in. the
annual .report -of ' the bureau of steam
engineering^ ' nor anywhere else." The
data ls.no doubt valuable to engine de
signers in Great Britain, where the great
est defect in naval vessels has hitherto
been in the motive power, but it is to be
regretted that there is no engineering
publication in this country with sufficient
influence or enterprise to secure such in
formation from our Navy Department.
Without', the sanction of the Secretary of
the Navy Admiral, Melville would not
have been able to extend the courtesy to
the London Engineer of furnishing ex
clusive important information to foreign
navies, i 'Â»-. ; ..
The position of chaplain in the Â¦United
States' navy is evidently a much sought"
after billet, the recent''
complaint by" one of , the' "corps ' tnat" r fh3 r
small pay was insufficient for an officer
to maintain himself with- "self-respect."
There is at present one vacancy, for
which there were over 400 applicants two
weeks ago, and the list still grows, al
though It is understood that the President
has promised the place to the Rev. Bow- ,
ers Reynolds Patrick of Duluth, a Bap
tist clergyman. The corps consists of
twenty-four .chaplains, the lowest pay be
ing 52500 while at sea and 52000 while on
shore duty, which salaries are increased
after . five years to 52800 and 52300, re
spectively. The highest relative rank is
that of captain, and the lowest is that of
lieutenant. When performing shore duty,
where no â¢ official quarters are provided,
allowances are granted for house rent.
The pay for retired chaplains is three
quarters that of the sea pay. There will
be another vacancy next November.

Lord Beresford type in the United States
navy. ' ;â¢
. Lord Beresford delivered an. interesting
speech recently before' the United Ser
vice Institution, in which among other
points . he advocated large battleships in
preference to smaller ones. He said: "We
have to fight all over the world, and
should have to fight very often at the
enemy's bases, therefore we must have, a
flotation that would float the same arma
ment , plus the coal." He criticized the
Admiralty, claiming that it lacked .sys
tem, and the same applied to the War
Office. The defects of. the Belleville boil
ers, he claimed, were ; largely due to the
want of trained stokers. Â¦: He 'commended
the new. idea of inviting the opinion of
subordinates. If he were going to have
a fight he would have. all his officers be
fore him to express to him their opinions,
and then he. would say to them: "Now,
gentlemen, you have been good enough to
give me your Ideas; you go and' obey, my
orders, so that there may be no mistake
about it." But if anybody gave "him an
Ideaâ he â¢ did hot care if he ' was only a
junior lieutenantâ that enabled him to
win the action, his name should.be at .the
masthead of every single ship after; the
action. There- Is need of officers of the
ADMIRAL. HAWKE, one of Great
â¢ Britain's v many : - distinguished
naval commanders, defeated the
Â¦ "French fleet In Quiberon Bay No
vember .20, 1759, gaining an im
portant victory. . On the same day the
populace of London, Impatient over what
was considered Hawke's delay in striking
a decisive blow at the enemy, hanged hl3
effigy in- the' streets.! "When six weeks
later Hawke came home he was received ]
with great enthusiasm,, the King settled a
pension 510,000 a year oh him, the pen*
slon to extend to his-, descendants, Parlla-. ;
ment gave 'him -a vote of -thanks and sev-' :
enteen years later he was made a Baron.
Hawke died in 1785, ' and his " successors
have been regularly paid " .'the., pension,"
Which up to the present* time foots. up to
the aggregate of 51.260,000. .None. of the j
gallant Hawke's descendants , have, dlstln- '
guished themselves either In the army or
navy, but two of them have broken their
necks in fox hunts. The present and sev
,ehth Baron, -Martin Bladen Hawke, born- ;
in .I860, was up to 1894 captain . of the :
Yorkshire Ninth Regiment, Is* now retired,
resting on his laurels, and is referred to
in "Who's Who", as a well-known crick-',

There are quite a number ot royal and
noble sailors 'besides Prince Henry of
Prussia. The ranking officer In the
Italian navy is Tom as so, Duke of Genoa,
who served through the several grades
and 1s now an admiral. The Duke of
Abnizzi, chiefly known as an explorer, la

Grand Duke Alexis, the latter, being the
lord high admiral. King George of Greece
and his son are likewise sailors by pro
fession, and very good ones. Prince Oscar
of Sweden and Princes "Waldemar and
Charles of Denmark, the present Prince
of "Wales, are all admirals In their re
spective navies, and Grand Dnke Con

Greece, is the only admiral In petticoat*.
She holds that rank In the Russian navy
In recognition for her kindness to Russian
sailors and of her remarkable, knowledge
of practical seamanship. -
Eussia has now seven large shipbuilding

The measure being one for the general benefit, its'
adoption should be strongly urged. It will be well,
therefore, for those who are interested in the subject
to write to their Congressmen in support of it.
It is worth noting that the inventor of the post
check plan, who is a successful business man and who
has patented the idea, offers, in case of its adoption,
to turn the patents and all rights under -them over to
the Government free cf any cost or charge whatever.
He considers that should the system be adopted the
consciousness of having accomplished; a reform of
such importance to the general public and business
men will more than compensate him for his time and
trouble. . Â¦ . â¢
The i; advantages which would follow the adoption
of the Gardner system are so apparent as to hardly
require statement. The postal checks would be in
circulation as currency and would be readily obtain
able at any time and from almost any store. They
woukj, in fact, be as common as bank bills and serve
the same purposes until made payable by t the sender
to a particular, person, after which the bill would be
come virtually a check. With such a postal currency
in" circulation there would be a large" increase of ac
tivity in nearly all lines of trade. The adoption of
the system- would be especially beneficial- to rural
communities whose postoffices are riot money order
offices arid who therefore have hardly any safe way
of sending smairamoiihts of money under the present
system. "Â¦.'-. ','."'
. These inconveniences and risks have long been felt
and many efforts have been made to devise a feasible
plan for getting rid- of them. The desired \ object
seems to be attained by a system devised by Mr.
Gardner ;of; Michigan and submitted in a bill now
before Congress. The measure provides for pjint
ing the one, two and- five dollar bills in the future
with blank spaces on the face. These bills of cdurse
pass from hand to hand/before the blanks are filled.
When it is desired to fsend', >one in the mails the
blanks . are filled in Wi.thfehe n^tne of the payee, his
city and State, a 2 : cent; postage stamp is placed in an
other blank space and canceled -with the initials of
the sender in ink, the name of the sender is signed
on the back, and, presto! his money has suddenly
ceased to exist as currency'and has been transformed
into a check on the United States, Government, hav
ing all the # safety . of any bank check, and ready: for
inclosure in his. letter. When the payee receives this
check he treats it just as he would any other check
â indorses it, goes -to the nearest bank or postoffice
and deposits it or has it cashed.. The j paid check
finally reaches the Treasury Department, when it is
replaced by a new one with the spaces unfilled. This
keeps the circulation at par. -No change whatever is
made in the financial policy of the Government, the
only change being in the character of the printing
on the bills of five dollars and under. . -.-"Â¦. .
EVERY- ONE who has had occasion to send
small amounts of money through the mails is
aware of the inconvenience or the risk entailed.
The. only safe way is that:of making use of a postal
money order, but to obtain the order:even in- a city
is a matter of considerable trouble, for one must go
to a postofficeand stand in line waiting his turn,
while to the farmer and others who live remote- from
postoffices the inconvenience is much greater. To
many persons, indeed, a trip to the postoffice to get
a money order means the loss of half a day. On the
other hand, to send money through the mails by any
other means subjects the sender to the risk of
losing it.

A number of lawyers in Chicago have organized an
association for the purpose of "promoting legisla
tive legal 'reforms.": Among" the aims specified Â¦ in
their programme is uplifting; the character of
the bar by, having unworthy members disbarred. A
scheme like that would, be worth trying in San Fran
cisco, even if it did originate in Chicago.
Dunphy gave to forty of his friend3 at
the Palace Hotel on Thursday. Although
some of us were not eligible as guests, we
have been none the less enthusiastic in
discussing it. The genial host arranged
no end of fun for. the dinner byintroduc
lng one of the guests as a German Baron
âLieutenantâ something, who spoke with
an accent and made grotesque speeches.
No one recognized him as Mr. "Wild, for
merly at the Orpheum, tout now residing
at 324 "Oak street.
The "Baron" showed great Ignorance
of Americanisms, and when Mr. Tobin
proposed a "bumper" he had to have the
term fully explained, while the guests
vainly tried to conceal their amusement
at his denseness. When. Judge Kerrigan,
in the happiest of moods, addressed the
lieutenant as "Lute." he hotly resented
the familiarity and there was a sensation
at the table, some of the guests taking
sides with the Judge, while others sought
to reason with the injured dignity of the
"Baron." It was not until the strange
"foreigner" sang two or three American
songs that some one whispered an idea
that Dunphy might be getting off another
one of his Jokes, but the 3ongs, like the
speeches, were in German accent, and
many continued to suppress their amuse
ment while Mr. Dunphy enjoyed hl3 laugh
unrestrained. Â»'*"â¢".Â»*
I wonder how many hearts Mrs. George
P. Wintennute won last Friday at the tea
she gave. This was the first entertaining

four months ago. -Everybody was delight

cordiality of the young hostess. She wore
a Parisian gown of the sheerest of panne

garniture was blue baby ribbon and
dainty white lace medallions.

If any of us are sorry spring is coming
it Is because we cannot, see Mrs. Tom
Magee Jr., with her fluffiest of muffs any
longer. Our grandmothers would have
scorned a lace muff in their crisp. New
England clime, but Mrs. Magee carries
one of thinnest tulle, and an- exquisite
affair It la, made of rows upon rows of
tulle ruchlngs. black and white alternat
ing. As there are fifteen or twenty of
these ruchings, four inches deep, the muff
is quite an immense affair, as muffs go. A _I
have heard that it was so much larger
when It came from New Tork that Mrs.
Magee had . it made smaller before she
could generate. enough American nerve to
carry it. What must it have been before?
A double ruff of tulleâ one black and one
whiteâ also belongs to this creation and is
tied with several wide black satin ribbons,
knotted at the ends.

IF it is an accepted truth that all the
. world loves a lover, there is 'no deny
ing the ; fact 'that all /the women love
â¢ fa bride, and what is 'more interesting
than to I make a character, study of
the' chosen'- one af ter .- the Â¦ happy man de
clares his choice to the world? We take
to ourselves : the flattering ; unction that
we are; much more capable of judging her
than ' the ' groom could possibly be in the
blindness ; of , his love, . and we realize a
satisfaction most prof ound in approving
his selection or jj take a j certain pride in
our own prudence . when ' we - disagree.
From the day Rowena Burns' engagement
was announced to the' immediate present,
covering her pretty wedding yesterday,
we . have heartily indorsed all the good
thing's ,we have heard about Charles Dun
phjv and knew he must I be a splendid
fellow to recognize such a priceless treas
ure and make it his own. We have known
all along that Rowena Burns was one of
the rarest in "the rosebud", garden of
girls.". "Almost any one can , smile under
favorable conditions and look pleasant in
a ' ballroom,- but it requires a sweet, gen
erous nature like the one in point to radi
ate, sunshine and show gentle considera
tion under all circumstances to every one
she meets. .,
Is. it so surprising, .then, that such
scores of presents were '.received from
admiring friends ? . It; would be impossible
to describe such a bewildering array,, for
a large room of the Burns' residence was
entirely filled with wedding gifts. That
immense' chest of silverware from the
Dunphys was a magnificent affair. The
wooden" chest itself was elaborately
carved and fully . four, feet long arid two
deep, containing a number : of large and
exquisitely wrought things, too costly to
be duplicated among: the other presents.
Colonel and- Mrs. - Burns presented their
daughter with a grand collection . of. Jew
els, many of Which are very old. The
necklace worn with t the bridal robe was
especially interesting,' halving once been
the property of- Marie Antoinette. ,.It was
a single row of large diamonds, suspended
' from a fine gold [ chain." The bride also
wore the -groom's giftâ a diamond sun
burst, consisting of ten brown and cherry
diamonds, set in a circle and many white
ones within. The stones were especially
fine and set' with true Tiffany art.
'- The. bride was certainly a picture in her
clinging princess gown of , white panne
satin, with the filmy tulle veil over her
pretty, girlish face. | The gown Itself was
an expensive creation, having a deep
flounce of rose point lace about the trail
ing skirt, while the bodice, too, had a lav
ish fearniture of the lace. The shower
bouquet Of lilies of the valley, tied with
white tulle, was happily chosen. , I am
sure nothing else would have suited herâ
unless, perhaps, white violets.
While we are on the subject of the Dun
phy-Burns nuptials, - 1 must say a word
about the farewell bachelor dinner Mr.
Train-robbing is a very cowardly crime. It re
quires more address than courage. As usually com
mitted the robber compels some member of the train;
crew to do the. dan get ous part of it, under threat of
death. The engineer is made to obey the robber's
orders with a pistol at his head, andcthe fireman is
by the same means compelled Jio place the dynamite
if an express or mail car is to be blown open and to
stand between the robber and the gun of the express
messenger. The commission of the crime has'al
ways the intention to murder as its necessary acconv
j.-animent. and its successful execution would seldom
be possible if intended murder were not used in the
act. Death should be the penalty, an'd when the rope
has choked a few of these miscreants the heroic ele
ment will cease to be attractive. .
When a train robber is imprisoned for his offense
he still remains a hero to such admirers and his con
finement is not reformatory. He is apt to consider
himself a deeply wronged man and to accuse himself
only of being caught. His crime does not disturb
his conscience in- the least. He is enlarged at the
end of his sentence to be looked upon as a much
injured man, and to seek the first opportunity to re
peat his exploits. /"
Proceedings in the Federal courts are not per
mitted to be turned into complimentary receptions
tendered to such criminals. Their legal rights are
protected, but they arc not privileged to* turn judi
cial proceedings into s, farce by the posing and in
terviewing which impress .others, of. weak morals,
that crime is a heroic business worthy of all praise
and of frequent imitation.
In criminal society the train robber figures as an
aristocrat. His position is of that high rank occu
pied by the Bulgarian bandits, who are held in awe
and respect by the communities which know their
crimes and shelter them from punishment. In this
State we have seen train robbers made heroes by a
yellow newspaper, which succeeded in generating a
diseased sentiment that saved the necks of the crim
inals,-who in eluding pursuit committed more than
one murder. The chief of these miscreants was set
upon a pedestal to be admired by the unthinking,
and he published interviews .upon such psychological
subjects as the time of day or night at which a man
engaged in criminal enterprise feels the most or the
least courage. This course was pursued until peo
ple who should have known better condoned his
scarlet crimes on the ground that a railroad deserved
A .Federal statute on the subject has many advan
tages over a local law. Trial of such offenders in/a
Federal court and infliction of the death penalty
upon conviction will be a quite different affair from
arraignment in a State tribunal. / '
The only fault to be found with the committee bill
is its lack of adequate penalty. If train bandits take
life the. bill fixes the death penalty; if they kill no ,
one the punishment is imprisonment of not less than
five nor more than ten years. This is wholly inade
quate. The penalty for â¢ train robbery should be
death. Every such robbery involves interference
with the lunning of the train and every such inter
ference causes the risk of derailment or collision and f
endangers the lives of passengers. There are statutes
that attach the death penalty to the crime of arson
when committed in a building where there are hu-.
man beings. Under such circumstances arson be-^
comes potential murder, and should pay the penalty'
of that crime. Train robbing should have the. same
treatment.
CONGRESSMAN KAHN has made a sugges
tive and valuable report for the Judiciary

bery. Railways are mail routes . and come under
Federal jurisdiction. Mr.: Kahn's report takes some
of the wind out of the sails of our pride by compar

At a meeting of the Trades and Labor
Council to-day the action of the Textile
Council was approved. ' ,.
The increase demanded was to have gone
into effect to-morrow, but , owing to the
delay of the reply the various unions rep
resented in the central body have not had
an opportunity to express their opinion on
the new aspect of the situation, so it has
been decided to postpone final action until
a meeting Wednesday evening next.
Meanv/hile special" meetings of the unions
will be held and a vote will be taken on
the question of strike. An informal vote
was taken to-day and it is said that three
fourths of the , number present favored a
strike, the others reserving, their/ decision
until Wednesday night.
LOWELL, Mass., March 23.â Lowell is
threatened with one of the greatest
strikes in its history as a result of the
communication sent to the Textile Union
by the mill agents in reply to the official
demand of that body for an advance in
wages for the textile operatives of the
city. The communication was read at the
meeting of the Textile Council this after
noon, and was. a positive unconditional
refusal of the demands/ It was not a joint
note, but each agent answered for him
self. The language, however, was identi
cal. It- is believed that the note was
framed at a meeting of mill officials in
Boston last Thursday night.
to Demands of Operatives.
J.0 well Mill-Owners Will Not Accede
F-EFTTSE TO INCREASE WAGES
There is a bare possibility that the fight
over the question of Cuban reciprocity
will be transferred to the floor of the
House during the coming week. The
probabilities, however, are that the reci
procity resolutions Introduced by Payne,
the floor leader of the majority, after tho
action of the Republican caucus last week
will not be called up until the following
week, though upon this point no definite
decision has been; reached as yet by the
leaders. The present programme is to
take up the. army bill after the disposal
of the MosB-Rhea contested election case
on Tuesday. Several days will be con
sumed in general debate on this bill, as
the Democrats are inclined to use It as a
text for speeches in opposition to the pol
icy of the administration in the Philip
pines. It is a foregone conclusion that
Rhea will be unseated when the vote on
his contested election case is taken on
Tuesday. ' Â¦
The Indian appropriation bill probably
will be reported from committee during
the week and will receive early atten
tion.
Senators Penrose, Mitchell and Fair
banks are among those who will make
speeches in support of the , Chinese^. bill.
This measure will provoke no little con
troversy, * ' r
Senator Proctor 'will . call up the oleo
margarine bill after the expiration of the
morning hour to-morrow ; and will make a
statement of the purposes of , the bill. It
is probable that further consideration will
be postponed then for a day. Senator
Proctor expresses the opinion that the
final vote on the bill will not.be long de
layed, and It Is understood that the mem
bers of the Committee on Agriculture
who are opposed ' will not contend for
many days for debate. Senator Proctor
already has presented to them the desira
bility of fixing a day for a vote, and
while many Senators have made no oppo-
Bitlon to > this proposition only Senator
Bailey thus far has objected. /
WASHINGTON, March 23. â The' oleo
margarine bill will receive the greater
share of the attention of the Senate* dur
ing the present week, but if there should
be a time when no - one is prepared { to
speak on it Senator Proctor, who will
have charge of it, will give way to the
Chinese exclusion bill, which is in the
hands of Senator Penrose.
In the event\ of .the -operators refusing
to recognize the committee it is within
the province of the : district presidents to
declare a strike after receiving the sanc
tion of ~ the national executive board.
When asked to-night if the above state
ments were correct President Mitchell
did not deny them, but declined to dis
cuss the subject. The entire matter now
rests with the delegates, and it is possible
the convention may not approve the reso
lutions. >
SHAMOKIN, Pa.,Â» March 23.â From an
official source It was learned to-day; that
an effort will be made ' to-morro-w to ; ad
journ the' joint convention : of districts
Nos. 1, 7 and 9, United Mine Workers of
America, â¢without committing the dele
gates to a strike declaration. \,"
At a meeting which . begun at 11 o'clock
last night and continued until this morn-
Ing the special committee appointed on
Sunday formulated; a resolution which tha
leaders hope will satisfy, both radical and
conservative delegates. The committee,
which consists Of President Mitchell, Dis
trict Presidents Klcol, Fahey and Duffy
and the three district vice presidents, held
another session to-night.
report of the committee will take
the. form of a resolution, the principal
clause of which, it is authoritatively
stated, . will recommend the appointment
of a committee to present to the operators
the demands of the' convention. Incor
porated in , the report are a number of
resolutions, adopted during the week, in
addition, to those made public by Presi
dent Mitchell. All of these resolutions, it
Is stated, contain a strike declaration, ef
fective April I,* but they were made sub
ject to resolution of the special committee
report, which,, so far as could be learned,
does not declare for a strike. All of the
demands made in the scale committee re
port are also embodied -in the resolution,
but the statement is made that. only two
of these, an eight-hour working day and
the weighing of coal wherever practlca*
ble, will be insisted upon if the conven
tion adopts the resolution. Should the
report) prove satisfactory the convention
is expected to select a committee com
posed of others than officers of the union.

manifestation for Captain Steve Castle, who
will this morning be released from quaran
tine alenff with the officers and crew of th*

and was unsble to leave her at the. bar on
account of rough weather. The transport later
returned to port on account of sickness aboard
and Pilot Castle shared the fourteen days de
tention in quarantine prescribed by Dr. Cum
mings for all hands.
Release Comes To-3>ay.
The case of the Castle Rock is by no
means unusual. People responsible for
the safe transfer of perishable goods
from ship's hold to warehouse are get
ting to rely as a matter of course upon.
McAdie's opinion, always freely given for
the asking and usually correct.
"When in doubt ring up the Weather
Bureau, and ring it up anyway, if you
want to be on the safe side," has become
an important maxim for the guidance of
carjro handlers.
" 'No rain to-day.' he told me. 1 have
depended on his Judgment, and how
ever threatening the sky, have worked
the cargo when I would otherwise have
been afraid to risk It." Â¦
"Mr. McAdie has saved the owners . of
that cargo from quite a- loss," said Ship
man yesterday. "Several times when . I
have telephoned â¢ the sun has been shln
lftg brightly and to me rain seemed to
be Impossible. Â¦
Â¦ " "You . will be safe for three hours,*
McAdie told me one bright morning. I
made my plans accordingly, and short
ly before- 1 o'clock, when the raln^ came
down in torrents, there was not a bundle
of cardboard on the dock.. He has also
saved us delay when the weather to me
looked like rain. .
The important part played by -this
branch of the Government service in safe
guarding the handling of perishable car
go : on open wharves is . not generally
known. Inspector Shipman - made it a
point every day while discharging the
Castle Rock to communicate with Fore
caster Alex G. McAdie before allowing
the stevedores to commence work. ' â¢
The British ship Castle Rock, which ar
rived here recently from. JAntwero,;.. has
Just finished discharging a large con
signment of. cardboard at Howard-street
Wharf. Cardboard is ticklish freight to
handle on an open wharf, owing to its
susceptibility to damage ; by. water. There
have been many rainy days since the
Castle Rock began discharging. In spite
of the fact, however, that cardboard was
handled virtually between showers not a
dollar of damage was sustained from rain.
Customs Inspector Shlpman, who super
vised- the discharging for the". Custom
house, declares that only the excellence
of the Weather Bureau service Raved the
cardboard from numerous drenchings.
On Tuesday morning the Algonquin came
back, but neither she nor the tug could
reach the wreck. The Ea's lifeboats had
all been carried away, but they had one
small boat left. Captain Garry ordered
this launched, and it finally put off with
fourteen men, who were' taken on board
the Alono.uin. The cutter then sent a
lifeboat off to the stranded ship and took
off the captain and crew. Thev were
taken t<J Wilmington. N. C, by the cut
ter and from there came to this city on
the Old Dominion ship. All on board
were saved except the captain's dog.
Tiger, and a cat belonging to one of the
men.
The same day the Wilmington, N. Cl,
towboat Alexander came along and tried
to go to the Ea's assistance, but could
not get alongside. Shortly afterward the
revenue cutter Algonquin appeared on the
scene, but she had to stand off because
of the heavy sea that was running.
By Monday the Ea's crew was in a bad
plight. The water tanks were broken and
either flooded with salt water or else run
dry. The stores were water soaked and
the seamen had nothing to eat. When the
cutter and tug reappeared Captain Garry
signaled for help, asking them to send a
boat if they could not 'run alongside, or
at least try to tlevise some means to get
supplies to the wreck. Neither vessel was
able to do anything for the crew's re
lief, as the sea was still breaking heavily
over the sands. The tug stood by the Ea
all night, while the cutter again put out
to sea.
The Ea left Fernandlna on March. 13
for Bilboa, Spain, with a cargo of rosin.
On Saturday morning, March 15, while
feeling the way in a thick fog with twb
lookouts forward and the captain and
both his officers on the bridge, the ship
brought up standing on the sand bank
Captain Uarry gave the signal for full
speeti astern as the snip grounded but
could not start her. No sea was' run
ning at the time, and the wind was light.
At 10 o'clock that night, when it was full
tide the captain tried again to back her
off. but failed. On Sunday a south-south
west gale came up and drove the vessel
farther on the bar. The wind kicked up
a heavy sea. wmch broke over the ship
with terrific force and she began break-

BING WORM AND DANDBTJPF.
They Are Each Caused by a Pestifer-
ous Grerm. :
Ring worm and dandruff are' somewhat
similar in their origin; each is caused by.
a parasite. ; The germ that . causes dan-
druff digs to-the root of the hair and
saps Its vitality, causing falling hair, and,
.finally baldness. ; Without dandruff 'there
would never.be baldness, and' to cure dan-
drufflit.is necessary to kill â¢ the germ.
There has been no Â¦ hair -preparation that
would do - this 'until, the % disco very of
Newbro's :â¢Â¦" Herpicide, which positively
kills^ the dandruff germ, allays itching
instantly, and make*, hair glossy and soft
as silk. At all druggists. Take no substi-
tute. .There is , nothing .''just : as good."/. |

over Maid o' the Glen. The latter won by
ft score of S to 3. She is a month older
than the black dog, and showed it in the
running of the course.
The detailed results of the day's cours
ing, with Judge John Grace's official
scores, follow: *
OREYHOUXDS from the kennel of
Eugene Geary distinguished them
selves in the open stake yester
day at Union Coursing Park.
Four of them were entered and
they defeated every dog they met until
tbe quartet had no more dogrs to conquer.
Under the conditions the stake had to be
run to the end, so they were drawn one
against the other, although /the first four
prizes had already been won. Under these
conditions America beat Ireland and Ruby
Sankey beat Fair Oaks.
In the deciding course America carried
off the honors, defeating Ruby Sankey
by a score of 11 to 3.
For a time It seemed the same state of
affairs would prevail in the special stake.
Of the eight oogs left in the third round
four represented the Curtis Kennel. Con
trary to expectation, the first three were',
defeated, leaving Narcissus the sole rep
resentative of the Santa Clara coursing
man. He proved equal to the task im
posed upon him, defeating Tralee Boy
pointless in tbe semi-nnal and shutting
out Vandal In the deciding course. The
loser in each of these courses is owned by
T. J. Cronln. Narcissus had one minute
less coursing during the day than Van
dal and showed great speed and deter
mination. .. ...- ....

1118 Broadway, March 23.
Thomas Vanderwerker, aged" 11 years,
the son of Mrs. " , Nellie Vanderwerker,
left his home ., for school on Tues
day morning last, and- has not been
seen by. his mother since. He did not ar
rive, at the school and his mother ' and
grandparents have scoured Oakland,'Ala
meda and Berkeley without securing the
least trace of. the mlssinglad. The case
has aroused considerable Interest from
the fact that the boy has been missing for
so long a 'time, and because there is -no
apparent 'reason for his absence if It Is
voluntary. Â¦ :-â¢ Â¦Â¦
The lad has been living with his mother
and her parents, Mr. and . Mrs. Thomas
Lane, at 260,Fifth street. He has been an
attendant at St. Mary's parochial school,
on Seventh and Grove streets, and started
from home .with his books:- on Tuesday
morning. His teachers at the school say
that ' he did : not , cdme to school that day
and they, have not seen him since. No one
has been found who, saw. him' on that
morning > or who has . seen him since,
though the lad is very well known In the
neighborhood in which he lives.
,The mother's anxiety has been Increased
by. the fact that a boy. by the name of
Blake reported 'that some, man offered to
tell the whereabouts of little Tommy for
J5,but when an effort /was made to locate
the man who made the offer he could not
be found. Thte gives an idea that abduc
tion; might be .behind the boy's disappear
ance: but. the .mother says -that this is
hardly possible, for, she is not able to pay
a sum large enough to make abduction an
object. ' .\ . .V. ' â¢ Â¦' . -
Â¦Â¦ -When the boy left home on the mornln"
he disappeared he was dressed In a blue"
double-breasted coat, with trousers to
match; ! blue, cap i and* ' black- -and; white
striped soft shirt. .He is light In complex

This ceremony brines to the heart â¢ of every

We must not think because these "children
were conflrmed to-day that we have lost ai 1
control over them. We must keep a watch
ful eye upon them. There Is not a day In.
their lives when they will not be brought into
contact with the world. . Like the noldler In
battle they are always confronted with danger.
Do not think that because these children are
confirmed that your Â¦ watchfulness over. -them'
may ceas*. Experience shows to the contr.ary.
whtn children'* minds are in a receptive
state it Is our duty and the duty of parents
to make them know and' understand the prin
ciples of our holy religion. This necessity Is
a continuous one. Let them gtÂ» . to Sunday
echool. to their sodalities and their- confra

will keep them within the pale of the church.
TTmÂ»* children's mass on Sunday, with the
Instructive words of the pastor, is almost: a
sacramental rite. To know their religion they
must be tautrht. Religion does not come; from
Inspiration, but from education." \LÂ«sflt become
Â» Â»Â»rt of their daily, lives. Let them-receive
the sacraments of the church frequently. The
greatest channel of grace Is prayer, and with
out prayer you cannot -receive God's grace.' Let

The two pictures â one representing the'Jew.i

Â©AKLAND," March 23.â The an
nouncement^ from Washington
that Congressman Victor H. Met
'â¢ calf is s beingiÂ« considered for the
. ', position^ of of the: In
terior to succeed' Secretary Hitchcock has
caused a great deal of political excite
ment in Oakland. .The Congressman from
Oakland has made such rapid strides in
Washington that his friends in Alameda
County see j In this ]lttle more than they
expected, for In Alameda County Victor
H. Metcalf is regarded as one 'of the
coming men of the State. . He holds his
home county in the hollow of his hand.,
and tl'ls fact is beginning to make itself
feit in" the rest", of the State. . ; i
Victor H. Metcalf Is now - in Washing
ton, where he has been given the greatest
honors.. At the beginning of his second
term he was made a member of the ways
and Means Committee of the House and
has been a member -. of the big and import
tant conference committees over the Cu
ban and -Philippine tariffs. In one term
the- Congressman from Oakland -has'
bounded over the heads of hundreds of
his" colleagues In the lower house of Con
gress, and now comes the word from the
capital of the nation that he is even be
ing considered for a place in the Cabinet
of President Roosevelt. The word has
already come .from Washington that
some of those â¢ who are associated with
Mr. Metcalf in the .work of the House of
Representatives â¢ have . said that they did
not sea why California did not put Mr.
Metcalf In the. Senate. 'â -
And while Congressman Metcalf has.
MISSING FROM
OAKLAND HOME
lne_ indications are that ,Mr.- Metcalfs
\v asmngton colleagues regard him Â¦Â¦ as
Just as available a man for advancement
as do his Oakland friends. .-.Â¦
O-T--T-T- TiiTnT..T..T..t t Â¦Â¦Â» 'Â».Â«'. .". . . . . ... _
It is thought that Mr. Metcalf could
control his own county against any fight
that could be j made against him, and
with , the reputation he enjoys in other
parts of the State through his command
ing position in Congress he would become
a very formidable candidate if he were
to run. :â¢ Â¦â¢'.'Â¦ Â¦ . '
And while MfT Metcalf has been repeat
edly saying that he had no ambitions for
the â¢ Governorship,' he has been covered
with more and more honors at Washing
ton, and the more dignities that are
given him in the far East the greater
grows in his home city and county the
talk of his becoming a candidate for the
chief executive of California.
'Metcalf is not a factional man in Re
publican politics. He has only been in
lire fore front of the political game for a
few years, and in that time he has not
dabbled In politics outside of his own
district. He has had one fight since his
first election, and he carried every voting
precinct in his district except five. He
has always kept himself out of State en
tanglements and has devoted himself to
his own district, in which he is master.
As a result he has made no enemies This
is being urged upon him as a reason why
he shoura try and unite the shattered
party. - - .
As the matter stands now it is distinct
ly a case of the office pursuing the man.
Mr. Metcalf is saying "No" and tryln"
to explain that he can be of more use to
the State at v Washington than at Sacra
mento. T '-. Â¦- , . . ., - ;
been spoken of In Washington for a high
position there has been a great deal of
talk at home about him. There are many
who have urged Mr. Me teal f for Gov
ernor in the hope that in him would be
found a man who could unite â¢ the fac
tions in the Republican party. But to
these Mr. Metcast has always said that
he-was a member, of Congress- from the
State -of California; that -he had a place
that was agreeable to him and which the
people of his district seemed willing to
award- to him, and his ambitions did not
extend ' elsewhere.

next will.;be positively the last of this
tuneful opera.' .ItVhas . made a- pro
nounced '.; hit.- and; large - houses --'greet
every performance. Ferris Hartman is
an excellent Duke of , Santa Cruz, and
Edward Webb as the out-at-heels, tenor
shares comic honors with him. Cunning
ham sings the famous "Serenade" with
much aplomb, and Harold Gordon is an
other musical favorite. Anna Lichter and
Frances Graham are both well heard and
Been. On Monday." April 7, the "Fortune
Teller" will be produced.
"Little Christopher" is ' in it3 second
week at Fischer's Theater and. is draw
ing large houses. The company has
shaken down into a compact,' competent
organization, and is flllin- its place with
considerable fitness. The piece is a
melange of merry nonsense, good songs
and choruses," and is well rendered by the
Fischer people, in particularly Mme.
Pilar Mprln. A number of bright special
ties are introduced during; the evening.-
The Alcazar ' management considers -tlie
large demand for seats for. "On and Off"
a good reason to continue the bill for,-an
other week. The bright farce will there
fore go this, week, and will be, followed
by Martha Morton's, favorite play,
"Brother John.'-' It is, announced that Che
delightful Japanese- playlet; I "Madame
Butterfly," will be staged in the near fu
ture. The new play by Mrs. Lottie Day
Coleman and Charles Francis Bryant Is

elaborate production of "La Tosca," an
other of the Sardou plays. Â¦ MacDowell
will be assisted by Florence Stone, who
will; be seen in the title role,, and the
Grand Opera-house stock . company. "La
Tosca" was given here last year by Sarah
Bsrnhar'dt and made, a profound impres
sion. The piece will be- excellently
mounted.. 'â¢ >.'r Â¦/.."Â¦ -
At the Columbia Theater for two weeks
commencing with this evening the attrac
tion will be Liebler &.Co.'s big â¢ produc-'
tion of "The Christian." This very suc
cessful play by Hall Caine was staged
hero two seasons ago and was received
in magnificent fashion. The company to
appear in the coming presentation of
Caine's great play is one of -superior
strength and is headed, bv Edward Mor
gan, | who will appear as John Storm,-; the
role created by him when the play was
first brought out in New York: . He will
be assisted by the charming young ac
tress, Elsie Leslie.. as_Glory Quayle, and
a company of fifty people. The entire
original New York stage paraphernalia
will be sent here for the presentation.

"The Denver Express," a rip-roaring,
dyed-in-the-wool melodrama, was given
for the first time here last night at the
California Theater to a small house:
"The Denver- Express" outvies "The Ser
vant Girl's Own" in interest, not to speak
of "The Fireside Companion." It has a
genuine is the a'ct of the Melanl that

rons and performers themselves were they
.given an earlier position on the entertain
ing programme. They sing well, and the
viollnsist of the party is quite au fait
whether in his rendition . of the classic
â¢ "Kaust" or the sinuous strains of Spanish
rhythm. Their songs are of Italy and have
all the romance of that musically poetical
country. They are sure to meet with
. genuine favor during their , engagement.
As for Lincoln, he can create any amount
of laughter in the easiest and . most re
fined manner. His humor is infectious.
In a dazzling blaze pretty. Papinta danced
and whirled and winged her. silken robes
under a score of rich flery colorsâ colors

and wondrous for their brilliancy. The
singing and dancing of George Gorman,
in -the character of a droll Irishman, and
Frances Keppler, a winsome little actress,
made an excellent impression and an en
core was . demanded. "The New\ Coach

The train was brought to a standstill
before the engine reached the switch.
There was a mass of wires in almost in
extricable confusion strewn over the
wrecked cars.
The wrecking crew was soon at hand,
together with a force of linemen, which
was busily employed during the day re
palrlntr the damage to pole and wired.
The battered cars were hauled .out off
the way after several hours' work. A
new train was made up and finally ar
rived safely at the pier. The blocking off
communication to the many track signal
points was the most serious result of the
accident.
None of the trainhands were injured.
Division Superintendent Palmer will hold
an investigation. ,
The train had been made up In the
yards as usual, a switch engine was on,
the head end and started to back down
to the pier, the departing time there be
ing 7:30 o'clock. A switch track runs
from the yards into the main line on
First street, connecting a few feet east
of Cedar street, where the yard linÂ©
tracks ' cross for freight trains into tha
yards from the Sixteenth-street connec
tions.
The four passenger coaches crossed the
switch in good order. The next car was
a baggage car. Just as the first truck;
struck the switch it was thrown either
accidentally by a towerman or because
of defect. The train was moving rapidly.
The trucks started off on the ties and
the car body was pulled cleanly off tho
trucks, landing against the signal pole
and upsetting. The other cars piled up in
a tangle on the tracks. .
Throwing of a switch at the corner of
Cedar ana . First streets caused the do
ralling of a Sacramento local 'train that
was being Oacked down to Oakland pter
from the West Oakland railroad yards
at 6:30 o'clock' this morning.
The train of eight carsâ tour passenger
coaches, a mail car and three baggage
carsâ was split in half. One baggage car
was hurled from its trucks and tnrown
against a tali telegraph and telephone*,
pole at the corner of the two streets,
snapping the big timber short off and
breaking hundreds of telephone and rail
road telegraph signal wires in that vicin
ity. , â¢
The cars that remained on the track
were' badly smashed, the wreck blockad
ing all traffic by way of the Fist-street
main line for several hours.

have marked the prices down very low, and
you can, while they last, secure a very great
discount on some specially good instruments.
Some of them have been sent as sample

as such fully warranted, but as the expense
''ot reshipment would be quite a sum. the

COLD, HJVIGOEATING DAY
AT THE PARK AND BEACH
about the same position In which it
grounded a week ago Thursday. The
tide was very low and the work of salv
ing the cargo was being carried on.
At the park early in the afternoon the
sun made a vain endeavor to warm
things and had almost succeeded, when
the wind Increased in coldness and caused
those in search of recreation and sun
ehine to leave the public pleasure grounds
much sooner than they would otherwise
have, done. The drive in the park was
quite large, and those who took advan
tage of the fine ro~ads enjoyed the keen
and invigorating atmosphere.
Dr. Carradine is a forceful and con
vincing minister. 1-io possesses a rare
vitality, his oratory is florid and pungent
and his manner is earnest and magnetic.
He made powerful remarks regarding the
general attitude of the clergy, us regards
the "second work of. grace." He- gave
the definition of human sanctiflcatlon and
the divine Banctitlcation, using. homely
find simple Mmlles for illustration. Thoro
were two rrieanlngfi, of sanctlflcatlon in
the English language, he eald. . One was
"to mako piirn and holy" and tho other
/'to sot apart," and becauso of the- two
meanings of tho word many peoplo were
befogged. Man must sanctify himself, ho
declared, but those men who did not live
right did not want to feel there was a
God, but wanted to Set rid of him. There
were men who doubted the divine crea
tion of the world and would have it go
forth that the universe was made up
from atomsâ which held a convention.
He (the lecturer) would rather believe
that God made the world. There , wero
many thousands In the church' who said
there, was no regeneration; others said
there was no witness of the spirit. : But
they could draw inferences from happen
ings in life. -The trouble with some peo
ple was that they thought that their
praying moved God, but he warned them
that that was not so, for God, 1 he said
was already moved. A man who "pulled
his, hand from the hand of God wan
dered. Therefore he besought that man
to retake the hand of the Lord, who
would lead him to abstain from' all evil '
God would sanctify him.
The halls in , which the services are
generally held are located in the retail
walk of cities, where mostly the stranger
and the idler are found, and the whole is
(sustained by voluntary contributions.

Mrs. N. A. H^bberd, 1008 Leavenworth
street, reported to the police yesterday
morning that a burglar had entered her
residence Saturday night during her, tern-;
porary absence by forcing open the front
window with a "jimmy."
She said that she returned to the house
shortly before 9 o'clock and as she opened
the front door she observed a'youngman
coming toward her from the rear. She
turned and ran out to the sidewalk and
screamed for the police. The burglar was
as scared ; as Mrs. Hebberd and jumped
with a crash through the kitchen window,
which was closed, and over the fence
into the Â« yard,- making his escape into
Pine street. . . > -
A woman' in a" French laundry In the
rear of the Hebberd residence saw the
burglar running . past> her window and
her dog chased him into Pine street. The
broken glass in the kitchen window is
marked with â¢ blood; showing that the
burglar had been cut in making hia leap

Detective Reynolds was detailed on the
case. . and Mrs. Hebberd told him that
when she ran outside and , called for . the
police she noticed a young man on the
opposite side of the street, who ran
away. He was evidently a lookout. She
was able to give a good description of
the two young men. Â¦Â¦ .
