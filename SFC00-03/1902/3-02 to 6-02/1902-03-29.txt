LOS ANGELES. March 28.â John A.
Muir. general manager of the Los An
geles Railway, read" the principal paper
of the; evening at the Sunset Club dinner
to-night, his subject j being "Ttie Railroad
Serviceâ Its Opportunities and ] Rewards."
Since Mr. Muir's retirement from the
Southern Pacific, afteAthirty years' serv
ice with that road, his friends In Los An
geles and elsewhere have hoped, "; but
scarcely' "expected, â¢ that he would â¢ tell
something of the inner life of the railroad
âof the events that led to his resignation.
Not until this evening, however, â¢ did an
opportunity offer. He said:
"The railroad service Is exacting in Its
demands. . It may well be. termed fasci
nating slavery. As a rule, and invariably
so in my \ experience and observation, its
opportunities are hard Work, and fre
quently the rewards are abuse, envy and
Jealousy while living, followed by an
early death and a forgotten grave.
"To mention specifically the opportuni
ties and rewards of railroad service leads
to som6 illustrative examples, which I
think are typical throughout the United
States. , : '.
"The late Jerome A, Flilmore, well
known to many of you f e'rsonally and to

Hence a similar fate,
"A, N. Towne, general manager of the
samo company, whom kind fate permitted
to die in harness after giving the com
pany jiis beet,* came up~from a'n~equally
humble beginning by the sheer force of
meritâ brakeman, station agent, yard and
train master, assistant superintendent,
superintendent, general superintendent,
and finally general manager.. And his re
wardâdeath, at an age when he should
be just in his prime.
THE PASSING OF HAYS.
"Sometimes the reward is neither Just
nor deserved; sometimes it is neither de
sired nor agreeable, although it may. be
eminently just and appropriate. Charles
M.,HayB, some time president of . the
Southern' Pacific Companyâ at least bear
ing that title, although never allowed to
rattle around." metaphorically, -.in' the
shoes of Mn Huntingtonâ received a Just
and .what might be termed a poetic re
ward. . . In the usual American way he
started at the bottom and polished up the
handles of the 'big front' so industrious
ly that promotion came rapid and sure,:
arid he dawned upon; the Pacific Coast
with' the new century, the* most envied
man'ln the railroad world, with the
biggest salary, It .is said, and with the
most magnificent opportunities.
"A chain 'Is. no stronger than its weak
est link, and his cometllke flight through
the .railroad world of the. West was
eclipsed "and. went out' in darkness ere the
first year of his reported five-year con
tract had expired.
Â¦Â¦'.' His downfall was sudden,' his disap
pearance complete, lie came to the coast
prejudiced against the old guard and with
the intention, as. It afterward transpired,
of removing every man (your humble
servant included) who held a responsible
position 5 in the service, no . matter how
faithful or competent he might have been.
Mr. ; Hays, however, ; miscalculated as to
the extent of his power and omnipotence
and had dropped from tho problem, as a
useless -factor, the. Idea of Justice.
/'His plans leaked out, he was hoist by
his own petard and with his -chosen, tool,
the renegade Virginian, Fiizhugh.i'ho was
rclcgatcd'to the glistening snowbanks and
frozen rivers of their Canadian habitatâ
in their coldness so typlcnVof their hearts
âwhile most of the old guard still; bask
and, nourish where tho golden west .bo
gently' slopes to the sunset eea."

BUFFALO, March 28.â The Express to
day publishes a story to the effect that
Karl Dalhnan, one of the three men sen
tenced to life imprisonment in thcr Kings
ton, Ontario, penitentiary for. attempting
to blow up a lock In the Welland canal
on April id, 1900," is no other than Luke
Dillon, the Irish : National leader' and
famous as a close friend of Dr. Cronin,
who 'was murdered in Chicago.
"All these things and many others I of
like kind point to a serious crisis in the
history of this movement, and it behooves
those who believe In, ' coeducation to
study the system with â all seriousness.
The grounds of discussion have ' changed
entirely, in the last generation. -The old
objections have lost their force , and' en
tirely new ones are now. to the front. The
notion that women are incapable of doing
college work so commonly urged a gener
ation ago has completely disappeared.
The objection that young men and women,
cannot be trusted to observe proper rela
tions in their social intercourse has I lost
its force in view of the plain fact that the
moral tone of . coeducational - â¢ institutions
Is.distinctly higher than that of the com
munity at large, and is certainly not.in
ferior to that of schools for one sex alone.'
."But, on the other-hand, one hears
oftener the claim that ,'Â¦ the increasing
number of women tends to feminize the
institutions where they are, in some case.i
to such an extent as to discourage the at
tendance of men. It is urged with in
creasing persistence that .the social dis
tractions and dissipations, with their
widening invasion of the,, serious purpose
that should go with school life, form a'
very serious problem, while others em
phasize the fact that the broad difference
in- the future careers of the two soxe3
should find a :, more adequate : recognition
in, the colloco curricula." â¢'Â¦ â¢ â¢
"A new period of questioning - is upon
us. A sort of vague prejudice, has risen
in the country at large, which- indicates
a new altitude of the public mind toward
the whole problem. .The fcystem is at
tacked on new . grounds and' from new
points of view. We are, moreover, not
leff to: merely theoretical criticism and
vague suggestion â¢ as to. what the public
sentiment is on the subject. This is evi
acr.ce.'i in certain quarters by some 'very
inlert sting external designs. The - ilia
tlnct alteration in the attitude of a num
ber of institutions toward the subject . is
Indicated by their policy.. The rapid
growth of- attendance at the women's col
leges during the past few years is also a
very significant fact. â¢' : :
"There are many slgn3 of a marked re
action in the public mind on the subject
of coeducation. Friends of the move
ment may well view it with some con
cern. The tide seems in certain ways to
have ebbed. A pronouncefl reaction haa
set ln.'T'Jot only has the system ceased to
make new converts, but there are indica
tions that it is losing ground in the very
terrltpry which It. had so completely won.
CHICAGO, March 28.-Dr. Edmund J.
James, president-elect of Northwestern
University, presented his first communica
tion to the board of trustees to-day. On
the subject of coeducation he. said in
part: .>w^
"Yes, I do. 1 think, however, . that it
will'-: take at Ioa3t eighteen Â¦ months- to
make -any show In that â¢ direction. The
blacklegs of the police department think
Colonel Partridge Is a nice old gentle
man, who Is immersed. In the details of
his department 'and doesn't know, what
is going on. They will find out when the
time ccmes. Colonel Partridge is, a firm
old gentleman, who will do- his duty. He's
been iri offlco but three months and has
hardly ,; had time to Â¦ arrange the simple
policing of the city.'* â¢ \
Asked about the expense of getting evi
dence, the District Attorney said the
committee of - fit teen had spent $20,000 in
that way; spending in some instances two
or three hundred, dollars to. get evidence
again3t a single house. The . defendants
would then, he said, be placed on trial
and sent: to the City Prison for a few
days or. fined a small x amount. : The re
sults, were discouraging, he said. It was
suggested to Jerome that. perhaps a soci
ety might be found which would bear the
heavy expense of : getting > evidence. His
reply .was: i.. Â¦ . . . .. : Â¦,Â¦
.'/Do' you know of. any society : that will
put;up $1000:; to. get .evidence? I don't:
1 m not going to spend money out of my
own. peckets when . I know that the
Comptroller will not make good." Â¦
Referring to the alleged loss of $71,000 at
one sitting by a young millionaire In Can
nefd's house, the District Attorney aald
that that amount to a man with twcive
million dollars was not nearly aa bad in
proportion as the losses of poorer people
in poolroomu and policy ehops.
"Do you think the police department
wlll.be regenemted in your term of four
years in oince?" was asked.
"I can close every bis gambling houso
In. town If the'Comptroller will accept my

"\\\. WASHINGTON, March 28.âRetalia
tion against Germany for her exclusion of
American meats was seriously considered
by the President and his Cabinet to-day.
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson believes
that drastic steps must be taken to pro
vent the German Government from con
tinuing Us policy of forbidding tho entry
of American meat*, ostensibly because
they miv unhcalthtul, but really in order
to meet tho. demands of the Agrariun
party. If the United mates lulls to com
pel Germany to revclnd this prohibition
other countries which receive American
incut* may feel that there Is reattonttblu
{rt-ouud for Germany's action and adopt
â¢ne t:am* policy.
Thus the American meat trade Is In
danger of Irreparable Injury, and Secre
tary Wilson believes It is nigh time for
the American Government to protect it.
)n anticipation of the discussion which
will shortly commence between the two
Governments. Secretary Wilson recently
directed the chemist of the Department
of Agriculture to examine German beers,
wlnca and foods imported into this coun
try. The report of ihis official, which the
Secretary read to the Cabinet to-day,
ehowa that German producers use pre
servatives and adulterants as freely, at
least, as is done in the United States.
The Secretary stated that there Is
ample ground for prohibition by this
Government of certain German products,
and he was disposed to recommend the
adoption of a policy of retaliation in case
liermany did not rescind the- prohibition
of -Importation of American meats. .
The President proposes that the, "State
Department shall make strong represen
tations oh the subject to Germany. Sec
retary Hay Is prepared to act as soon as
Secretary Wilson transmits to the State
Department the facts which he has gath
ered, but in the preliminary note he will
probably do no more than make an In
uirect remonstrance. The State Depart
ment believes that It might be wise to
suggest the appointment of a commis
fcJcn, comprising German and American
chemists, to investigate the whole sub
ject of adulterants.

Letter of Resignation.
As to Medical Boards.
"Complaint Is also mado that I should
have given an" increase for each applica
tion. ' Last year there were probably JUO,
000' increase claims rejected. If I had
glvdn the -lowest Increase this would have
meant an additional expenditure annually
of more than $2,000,000. It does not, how
ever, make any difference how n.uch
money the Government spends provided
law and facts Justify the expenditure.
These claims were rejected on their
merits.
"It ls~ claimed also that the Pension Of
fice does not always allow ratings rec
ommended by the medical boards. We
have followed the rule of rating a man
according to his disability rather than ac
cording ta his rating. .. There are 1500 pen
sion boards scattered about the country
who have no experience In the adminis
tration of pension laws, and they make
recommendations, sometimes In the same
case, so radically different that. the Pen
sion Office must consider the facts and
late the pension according to disability,
and not the . recommendation of the
board." â¢ ,
Evans insists that he has not been in
formed of the post to which he will be
transferred. He stated emphatically,
however, that he would not go to Cuba;
that so far as he knew there was no
thought of giving him this mission. It
seems to be the general belief that when
Storer is appointed to an embassy, aa the
President has promised. Evans will be
sent to Spain.
"I have been In the Pension Office five
years," said Evans to-night, "and during
that, time about 1,100.000 pension cases
have been acted upon. The Pension Office
has an excellent ? working force, which as
. stated me materlully In bringing the work

SAN DIEGO. March 28.â The torpedo

notified that she might expect a visit
from the destroyer at any time between
sunset and the rising of the inoon at
about midnight. On board the' battleship
the same watch was kept and the same
precautions taken as in actual war. The
conditions were that the Farragut must
get within 1500 yards of the battleship be
fore the latter got a searchlight on her.
The darkness favored * the torpedo-boat
and she glided along toward the Wiscon

SAN JOSE, March 28.â A daring rob
bery'was committed at the Wolfe drug
store on First street, near San Fernando,
last night by ' Josephr- Clinton, a young
man .who recently came here from Texas.
Clinton, who had been helped on numer
ous occasions by the' clerks of the place,
asked permission .to use the telcpnone,
which was next to the safe in the rear of
the store. While the clerk was in the
front of the place Clinton opened the safe
door, which was. not locked, and took a
box belonging to the Wolfe Drug.Com
pany, containing more than J100.
A 1 few minutes later the money was
missed, and 'â¢ Sheriff Langf ord â¢ was noti
fied. That Â¦ official and his deputies at
once started to look for Clinton. Early
this morning he was found in a saloon,
where he was rapidly spending the stolen
coin; He was partially under the influ
ence of liquor. When arrested he at

quickly overpowered. He had $0Â« in his
possession. .

Riddle and his attorneys and witnesses
at the trial to-day declared their belief
that Paulsen is not dead and that ho
feigned death and afterward made his
escape from the vault and that he is alive
to-day.
An Insurance company which ; carried
$6000 on Paulsen's life became suspicious
and had a local agent investigate the
death and he saw the body in the>vauit.
but stated that the face of Paulsen was
very lifelike. The insurance, however,
was paid and Mrs. Paulsen started for
Germany with what was supposed to be
the body of her husband, and is now liv
ing in some Inland province of that coun
try.
When the disclosures. were made by the
discoveries of Riddle, who was not a
party to the corruption, Roach made a
confession and implicated a number of
other people. Paulsen was forced to a
confession also and promised to make res
titution. He .went to his home' in Helena
for the purpose of securing the money,
ani> a few hours later Â¦word was sent out
that he had died, that ruport being fol
lowed by, the statement that he had com
mitted suicide. The body was at once
placed in a receiving vault by his wife,
who had refused to admit any one to the
house to see the body.
By a scheme of bribery and Kraft it
had been charged that' Paulsen : obtained
from the contractors, J. A. Riddle, C. E.
Roach and Qharles Suiter, more than
$8000, for which he secured contracts . for
them, approved their accounts and made
large and excessive estimates of the work
done In their favor.
BUTTE, Mont., March 2S.â The startling
assertion was made in the District Court
to-day in connection with the trial of a
case growing out of the bribery and scan
dal over the building of the State educa
tional institutions for Montajia that John
C. Paulsen, the State Architect, who was
supposed to have committed suicide in
March, 1S97, is not dead; but is living at
the present time, somewhere In' Germany.

Governor Chatterton this afternoon sent
to A. T. Bueler, Prosecuting Attorney of.
Natrona County, the following telegram: Â¦ -
â¢v "In : the brutal lynching ; of Woodward
the - fair;- name -of Wyoming has been
dragged in the' mire, the order of our
Supreme Court disregarded, the law
grossly violated. The reports . indicate
that no precautionary -.steps were taken

violation. , In the name of the law which
has been' violated and as the acting ex
ecutive of : the State I call upon you, the
county prosecutor, to institute and make
a" thorough investigation of* this crime,
with a view to the punishment of the
guilty parties." .
On the night of December '30, -15)01, they
sawed off the bars of their cells and a
window and got away. '- At the stock
yards east of town Charles Woodward se
cured a pistol which had , been placed
there by a friend. Near; Casper he stole
a horse and rode, to his ranch, reaching
the place . on the evening of January 2,
1902. 'Instead of finding-triends ready, to
assist him- he. founds Sheriff Ricker and
two- deputies 1 at'.' the..- .house, who were
lopking â¢ for.- him. t . He .went-' to < the barnT
intending.. to abandon his horse. and steal
one -of the offlcers'. animals. It was about
7 - o'clock in Â¦ the evening, and was quite
dark. ;He mounted one of the Sheriff's
horses and was ready to ride away when
the Sheriff j came out of the house, and,
approaching the barn, ordered him to sur
render. Woodward instantly shot- th3
Sheriff through the body, and the officer
fell ,to the ground, mortally ' wounded:.
Woodward then,' it. is said, went to the
dying man and. struck him on the -face
with his six-shooter.
Woodward,, with his wife. Bertha and
brother Clarence, was. arrested previously
on the charge of sfealing^, cunning and
provisions from a ranch.' It was alleged
that WoodwaTd's- ranch was the head
quarters of .a' band of ' cattle and horse
thieves. At the preliminary trial Bertha
Woodward was released from custody.
The brothers were held .to the District
Court, but " were unable to furnish bonds.

and the rope began to tighten. Wood

The most dangerous false friend is the
one that under the guise of friendship
day by day insinuates himself into your
good graces and takes advantage of the
association to do you harm; that is
exactly the position of coffee. It enters
your sanctum under the guise of a warm,
close friend and slowly day by day
works away at your destruction.
Why this should be no one can say. but
it 1* a fact nevertheless. Hundreds of
thousands are testifying of the terrible
Btraits that coffee drinking has kd them
into.
% In our clearer moments we know that
health, bounding, perfect health, brings
with it the poise of nerve and clearness
of mind that makes us kings instead of
elaves, and brings a heaven on earth
to us.
Through the very perversity O f man.
kind, showing the elements of a tanglb!e
demon, we persist in taking into mouth
and stomach the false friend even
after wo know it is working to throw us
out of the peaceful heaven of health,
ixnd set up within us that condition of
disease that the nerves show variously in
dyrpeppla, heart trouble, kidney trouble,
etc., etc. .
The patient physician who has for
years been explaining to different people
under his care the powerful effects of
cc-fTee on highly organized persons,
fii ally becomes a bit careless and feels
that he can only point out the facts ami
thai lft patients go their own path. Their
vtry por\-Â«rsity will make of them
Flavcs=. and they follow .the habit with
the blind, dogged fatalism that cannot be
t r.derstood. K3m

Paine's Celery
Compound
.
Trinraphed After the Failure o?
Physicians.
Mrs. Tallman of 191 Redmond St., New
Brunswick, N. J., grateful for the rescue
of her little boy from suffering and death,
writes as follows:
"I have used Paine's Celery Compound
for our little boy. He had been under tho
doctor's care for five months, but did not
seem to get much better. The physician
said the child had spinal trouble. He Is
three years old and was obliged to creep
'on/ his >hands and knees and was too
weak to sit up long at a time. We bought
a bottle of Paine's Celery Compound, and
before it wa3 half gone we saw a bis
change In the boy. He Is now real fat
and strong, and can walk all around the
house, and has red, plump cheeks. Paine'*
Celery Compound cured him."
In the face of such testimony who can
deny Â¦ the fact that. Paine's Celery Com-
pound restores to strength, vigor and new .
life? Hundreds of such letters as Mrs.
Tallman's are on file for the Inspection ot
doubters.
Wh"en your children are weak, run
down, nervous, fretful, despondent, have
loss of appetite, slow circulation of blood,
give them Paine's Celery Compound for
a week or two, and note well the cheering
results in returning health and vigor. W*
strongly urge the immediate use of the
great medicine for- all sickly and weak
boys and girls. Â¦ _^.

of the law will , be rai3cd and the
sportsmen . who enjoy the "calm,
quiet, innocent recreation of angling"
will try to lure from ' his dark
haunts under the tangled wild brush the
monarch of the brook.
For five months the trout in the public
waters of the State, have been jealously
protected and "allowed .tp^ipcreaje Jand
multiply. . From all available "information
the fishing' should be fully, as good as in
former years. -,.-',-
The' California State Fish Commission
has, made a. wide distribution of trout
.throughout the publje waters of the State
during the past year, A thus aiding nature
to replenish the streams which anglers
frequent.
There were two distributions, each of
.50,000 rainbow trout, in the Sacramento
â¢River, north of Delta. Lake Tahoe,
Leaf Lake and two small lakes
near by received 375,000 trout. They were
of the Loch Leven and German brown
trout species, which seem to thrive best in
these waters. They are a* great sporting
fish and are of fine flavor.' Donner Lake
received 75,000; the lakes about Cisco, 25,
000; independence Lake,. 25,000,. and Web
ber Lake, 25,000. '
.In addition to these the streams of Mon
terey,' Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Marin,
Alameda, Napa and Sonoma all shared in
the distribution. . Â¦
The near-by 'streams will be whipped by
the most ardent anglers next Tuesday,
but many will not be able to wet a. line
until next Saturday and Sunday.
Paper Mill Creek will attract the major
proportion of anglers on . Tuesday, as it
nas annually since John Butler, as a
beardless boy, romped about its banks.
This* tiny stream has yielded more trout
and afforded more sport than possibly
any stream of its size in the world. Its
resources seem exhaustles3, and just
whan it is pronounced fished out it takes
on a Â¦ new lease of life and yields trout
enough to satisfy the men who line its
banks. - ,
On opening day, instead of using the
fly, the majority will fish with roe,
'shrimps and angleworms as bait. In May
the liynshlng.will he.- at its best.
i It invariably happens that the men who
go out on the opening day of the. season
are disappointed if they weigh their pleas
ure against" the actual number of fish they
catch. The streams are invariably high
and the waters have hardly cleared after
the winter freshets. The true angler,
however, -is always a philosopher, and a
day on a trout stream with genial com
panions is -sufficient recompense for his
trouble." /.Â¦'; , . -

fish on their preserve in Maria County.
John Siebe will fish on .the Tamalpaia

Fishing should be excellent at Boulder
Creek this Â¦ year. The streams have been
better Â¦ protected than ever before. The
late rains gave the trout a chance to grow
to larger size before high water came
and let the salmon in from the ocean.
They usually destroy a large quantity of
the small fish. The water is still' quite
high.
The fishing at Webber Lake should be
at its best about the middle of June.
Just after the ice breaks up. The fly
fishing on the Truckee should be ' good
on June 1, although it is generally be
lieved to be at Its best a month later.
Among the anglers who have signified
their intention of being present at the'
opening of the season on > Paper Mill
Creek are: T. Rothschild, F. â¢ Stevens,
James Watt, W. A. Cooper. F. Walter

Eos Gatos advices are to the effect that
excellent fishing can be had by the middle
of April in the mountain streams about
that locality. It is advised that fishermen
leave the train at Wright or Laurel and
fish down stream, as Los " Gatos Creek
has a number of feeders In that vicinity;
where trout may be found.
The McCloud River, one of the noblest
streams in the State, can hardly be fished

McCloud Still in the Snow.
The trout from the State Hatchery are
all placed in the river from Gibson to
two miles north of Sims, making that lo
cality especially attractive to anglers.
For some reason, difficult to. understand,
few new anglers make their appearance,

In the vicinity of Geyservllle. ; ' â
Through the courtesy of James Hors
burgh Jr., general assistant passenger
agent of the Southern Pacific Company,
the following information is gleaned re
garding the trout streams reached by the
trains of that company:
At Boca and Truckee the prospects are
pronounced 'good for â fishing * about the
middle ot. April. . The stnAmi* are -high
and muddy and there is car^ttlerable snow
oh the ground. Bait fishing will be good
as soon as the snow disappears.
From Sims comes word that' the
scarcity, of . snow on the mountains in
sures low water, thus favoring. good fish
ing at an early date. Fishing streams
tributary to this place. In addition to the
Sacramento River, are Mears. Hazel.
Flume and Shotgun Creeks. While the
flah from the creeks are smaller than
those in the river, they are more numer
ous and more readily caught. Â¦

of the men are well up In percentage.
McFarland, '05, Is displaying the best
form in the box. but both Parker and
Fritch will give him a close race for tho
position. McGilvray is proving himself
a varsity, catcher and probably would
have beaten out Ball, last year's catcher

has been moved In from center field to
third base and Brown, last year's third
baseman, has been shifted to Copp's po

be a permanent one. Crawford and

and speed. Jf the club does notarrangs
a match for Brttt within the next few
days the officials will abandon the idea
of giving Jimmy a -chance to increase his
reputation during the month of April and
substitute another good match Instead.
The aDpllcatioh of the National? Ath
letic Club for a writ of prohibition re
straining the Board- of- Supervisors from
granting, the Yosemite Athletic Club a
permit to hold a boxing- exhibition next
month was heard before Judge Seawell
yesterday. The Supervisors were repre
sented by Attorney Hugo K. Asher and
Alfred Morgenstern appeared for the !Â¦Â»!*Â¦â¢
tlonal Athletic Club.
The managers of both boxers have had
a talk and a match between them is as
good as made. Everything depends* upon
the condition of Lnvigne's arm. Should
the pair meet, the fight-going public will
probably witness one of the greatest bat
tles between- lightweights that ever took
place in this city.
If Britt Is not matched to fight next
month he will probably accept a flatter
ing theatrical engagement that has been
offered him 'during the month of. April.
There Is considerable talk of a 'fight be
tween Brltt and Kid Lavigne for May.
Lavlgme's arm is rapidly growing strongei
and by that time he will probably be auis
to meet Britt.
Brltt is doing light training every day,
and should the Yosemite Club be sucess
ful in getting a top-notcher at the last
moment Brltt will be In condition to take
him on.
THE managers of Yoseinite Athletic
Club have .thus far been unsuccessful
in securing the services of a suitable
opponent to meet Jimmy Brltt. First
UcGovern was offered the match, but ho
declined. on account of a theatrical en.
Easement. Then "Willie Fitzgerald, the
crack. Eastern man.^was suggested, but
the .weight . question made the match im
possible. "When the managers of the club
began making the wires hot with dis
patches to Dave Sullivan it was thought
they had finally hit upon a good match.
But Sullivan could not be Induced to
come out here and fry conclusions with
the hard-hitting ex-amateur.
BERKELEY,' March' 28.â Work among
the University .of California .track
athletes has been- light 'during tho
past, five days Rowing'; to. the' final
preparations for the general, tryout,
whic^i wilKbe held" Saturday: The men
have been coming out but once a day,
and have gradually lessened the amount,
of practice taken until to-day' they exet
clsed merely enough to keep their muscles
limber for the coming contests.
/Work will, pick up again after to-mor
row's -events. 'Then the nien will settle 7
'down to practice for the one meet they
have. on this coastâ that with Stanford on
April 19. 'After that date the Eastern
track team will be picked.
The men have' been showing up weliTe
cently â¢ and â¢ are In good condit-on. The
two. star athletes, .flaw and Cadogan,
may not be in' the meet to-morrow, al
though both are entered. As their places
on the. team are assured .they may not be
put to the strain of a contest at tnls time,
particularly , as Plaw has been training
unusually hard and Cadogan has a leg
which he. strained 'Some time ago and
which heeds careful attention. Both men
are well up. in their Work, and with the
care they get from Trainer Christie there
is no Â¦ reason why they should not be in
splendid condition 'fpr the intercollegiate
contests." ' â¢ : *';*-'
": The: races : to-morrow : will be run off ac
cording to the. new schedule of order of
events adopted for the intercollegiate field
day, and. /which' will be effective for the
first time this year." The field events will
remain the same. 'According to the new
rule the number of track events shall be
thirteen. Their order, which is as fol
lows, differes from. the old rule:
One-mile' run, '. 100-yard heats; 120- yard hur

carry off these events. Second place will
be closely contested! by Brown and Aba
dleÂ« The latter has. been gaining ln speed
and between .- him . and/ Brown- there will
be but smalt distance, when the tape is

in 10:39 at." the Â¦ freshman-sophomore field
day. of last week. Is a. man of 'remarkable
nerve and is expected -to .distance the

good second. 'In the half-mile. Service will
lead with Edwards a probable second.

take "first in both weights, s Goombs and

McGreal was a gory one. Young was
given the trophy, but a draw would have
been satisfactory.
The contest between Jack Dunn and
Paul Boiler was a .fitting _ finish of the
night's entertainment. Dunn was as wild
as an untamed steer. He rushed Bolier
at the opening of the round and knocked
him to his knees. But for the referee's
interference he would have struck Bolier
while he was down. The latter regained
his > feet and in a terrific mix-up Dunn
stepped ' into a bucket of water. ' In a'
moment the ring: was tilled with . water
and' bottles. Bolier slipped to- the, floor
and stayed there. Dunn lost his head
completely and wanted to fight every one.

Lady Downshlre was for several seasons one of the reigning beauties of Lon
don society. She was a daughter of the Hon. Hugh Hare, younger brother of
the Earl of Lis towel. She married the Marquis of Downshlre in 1893 and has
two sons and one daughter. Lord Downshire is only 31 years of age, having
been born in 1871. He has seen service in South Africa. The family estates
cover about 120,000 acres. The Marquis Is a nephew of Lord Arthur Hill, who .
was controller of Queen Victoria's household for a long period of years. The
London advices intimate that the husband is the aggrieved party and will start
the divorce proceedings.

ADVICES from London state that there Is no longer any. chance of a
happy.. termination of the matrimonial differences between the Marquis
and Marchioness of Downshlre, although every effort has been made to
bring abouC-an amicable arrangement. When the rank and position of
the parties concerned are considered. It may well be imagined that the
affair will create no little sensation In London society, and Indeed throughout
England. 'Â¦: â¢ . : Â¦ - "

went to Ireland with the Earl of. Essex when Queen Elizabeth, sent her favorite

Fairford and Earl of Hillsborough. who was one of the leaders of the British

This harmony of Europe with respect to. us is not
so important by any means as the harmony with re
spect to v China. Hence there has been a great dif
ference in the method of manifesting it. When the
issue arose among the diplomats at Washington as
to which had been our best friend during the Span
ish war, the various Governments contented them
selves with making semi-official statements and dis-^
closures of notes and comments passing among them
on the subject; but in dealing with the Chinese
problem they have been much more solemn, elabor
ate and emphatic. They have formed among, them- â¢
selves treaties having no other object than that of
preserving China. Britain has allied herself with
Japan, Russia. has allied herself with France,' Ger

advisability of maintaining the open deer and an un

is the concord on the subject that the Governments

The blunders committed in the Jameson raid and
the aggressions that led up to the war are now so ap
parent to the world that Rhodes dies a discredited
leader, and will probably receive less than his due
share of commendation. His larger plans were not
essentially false, nor foolish. He contributed liber
erally to the fund raised to help Parnell make the
fight for home rule in Ireland, and stated that he did
so because the success of that fight would "tend to
bring about within the empire a system of local self
government and imperial federation which he be
lieved to be essential to the maintenance of the vast
empire he hoped to see accomplished. Such ideas
give evidence of the broadness of his mind, and at
test the fact that he did not aim at a vulgar domina
tion over unwilling peoples. Had he been possessed of
patience he might have, accomplished some such fed
eration in South Africa, but he knew that the incur
able disease that had been working in him from his
j-outh was wearing Jiim away, and he sought to force
events to a swift conclusion. The result of his mad
ness is a tragedy that appalls civilization.
The dream of a united South Africa as a part of the
British empire, with a railway from the Cape to
Cairo, seems to be hopelessly shattered, but it may'
be attained in the future under different auspices, and
the descendants of both Boer and Briton may yet pay
reverential visits to the lonely tomb' on the distant
mountain where the body of the great dreamer lies'
and do homage to him as the father of the idea of a
great South African federation. {""<; ,;; .j- V ;
erroneous. He certainly had larger schemes for the
advancement of Britain, and worked more resolutely
to carry them out than any other Briton of his gen
eration. On the other hand, .the methods he em
ployed to carry out his plans were distinctly those of
an unscrupulous stock jobber and a reckless buc
caneer. The war in South Africa was precipitated
r.ot because Rhodes desired possession of the Trans
vaal gojd mines, but because the two Boer republics
stood in the way of his continental ambitions; but
the fact remains that the tactics by which he pre
cipitated it were identically those which would have
been resorted to had he no higher aim than that of
lobbing the Transvaal of its treasure.
Judgment upon him will of course differ according
to the degree of sympathy or antagonism which the
critic of his life has for his aim. A considerable
number of his countrymen deemed him the greatest
Englishman of his time. There are others who look
upon him as hardly better than a stock gambler and a
filibuster. Neither of those opinions is wholly
Rhodes was of the type of men who love power
more than anything else in the world. He sought
money solely for the use he could make of it in
politics and statecraft. He appears to have had no
liking for luxury of any kind, ostentatious or artis
tic. His household was simple and his mode of life
almost abstemious. He built up and carried on vast
commercial enterprises, but his imperial plans and
hopes were so much grander that he is never ranked
in the public mind with the great financiers or in
dustrial magnates of the time, but with men like Clive
and Hastings, whose thoughts and energies helped
to build up the mighty fabric of the far-reaching em
pire of Great Britain.
BY the death of Cecil Rhodes a master spirit
departs from the earth. He aimed to be an
empire builder, but it remains to be seen
whether his aim is to be attained. Certainly it has
not been attained by him. He dies leaving his work
incomplete and in such confusion that it rriay never
be completed. Of that he himself was well aware,
and the reports of those who attended his sickbed
tell us that during the long days of his illness he
continually sorrowed over the fact that he left so
much unaccomplished, "So little done, so much to
do," was an expression repeatedly upon his lips. ,
, CECIL RHODES.
While the chief hope of the Democrats is thus
based upon the possibility of Republican blunders,
the main dread is in Bryan. Were the Republicans
to make.forty blunders, and the Democrats to adopt
live issues and sound policies, and then Bryan were
to. whirl, in. and call upon the silver men to bolt, what
would become of the : sound policy men?
As a ru|e the Republican party commits few blun
ders; but it is not to be denied there is danger now.
The fight for reciprocity treaties constitutes, a
menace to the strong position the party has hitherto
occupied on the tariff question. The possibility of
delay in enacting the shipping bill and the Nicaragua
canal" bill' is also something of a cloud on the imme
diate prospects of the party. The . situation, 'there
fore, is by no means secure, and it is certainly worth
while for Republican leaders to take heed of what
they do or leave undone. .
Upon every living issue of the d,ay the Republican
party has the strongest position it is possible for a
political party to take. It stands for^sound money,
Chinese restriction, protection . to American indus
try, the promotion of American commerce, the
prompt construction of an isthmian canal, banking
and currency reform on sound > principles and. the
proper administration of the affairs of our colonial
possessions. So long as the party stands firmly for
these policies its hold upon the masses of the Ameri
can people cannot be ; shaken.' Democracy, then,
has no hope except in' some blunder oh the part of
the Republican leaders. Nothing but folly at Wash
ington can afford any reasonable hope to the Demo
cratic,leaders of carrying the country this fall.
Live issues and sound policies are desired o.f every
party, and it is only once in a generation that a po
litical organization gets so completely knocked out
in a contest before the people that it remains vir
tually stagnant for six years, lying dazed and half
dead, as it were, while the world goes on to new
things. That fate Democracy suffered under Bryan,
but it cannot remain Bryanizcd forever, and conse
quently we may reasonably expect, it to have eyes to
see live issues this year. It is not clear, however, that
the mere restoration to a sense of living things is
going to be sufficient to enable, it ..Jo win. To carry
a. majority of the House of Representatives the
Democrats will need not merely- 'live issues and
sound policies, but policies so much sounder than
those of the Republican party that the people will
consent to elect, a Congress adverse to the admin
istration. .
DEMOCRATIC statesmen .and ".' Democratic
have rret the merry ; by.
bursting into songs; of - victory " to. ''â¢ come.
Very nearly every' politician ofnote in the party hÂ«s
warbled forth something of a' nature to cheer the de
spondent and rouse, them to a sufficient degreed of
hopefulness to put up coin forr -the â¢^Congressional
campaign. Each and all of the voices ;join in the
chorus that calls for, harmony and live issues, â¢ but
there is some little divergence as to what are live
issues and how harmony is to be attained. .
.^The crucial question^ then, that confronts the
Democrats is that pf agreeing upon a platform. They
seem to be quite confident they can win if they can
only agree upon what to fight for. Representative
Pugsley of New. York recently put the issue in this
way:. "I believe the outlook for Democratic success
in the fall elections is decidedly encouraging. The
real question in my- mind,' when I to
weigh the chances of wresting the House from the
Republicans, is simply this: , Will the Democratic
party go \ into the campaign with live issues and pro
pose to deal with the great public 'questions of to-day
in a manner that will appeal "to thVjustice, patriotism
and common sense of the American people? Does
the Democratic party desire to reinstate itself in the
confidence of the people, and is it willing to pledge,
itself to sound policies?"

It is a pitiful spectacle, this suicide of "& nation. It
is startling in these enlightened days to see the bar
barism of a thousand years ago smiting the mouth
that utters the genius of this better age. On one side
a mass of ignorance, worshiping the white Czar;
on the other the inspiration of Rurik, whip and sword
in hand; and, between this upper and nether mill
stone, the best thought and highest aspiration, the
mental illumination and normally the future hope of
the empire, with its brain and bone and marrow
ground to iMp- Brute force" and brute indifference
may long maintain autocracy, but the rest of the
world will wonder at the longevity of a nation that
knocks out its own brains.
\ This time they had made progress. They no longer
put up a negative protest, but an affirmative pro
gramme. They ceased to supplicate; they demanded.
They, asked for freedom of conscience, the right to a
.voice in their own affairs, the privilege of fixing their
own career and their own destiny. They demanded
what the Scandinavians got through Gustavus Vasa,
the Hungarians through the sacrifice of Kossuth, the
English at Rumnymede, and the Americans at York
town. They demanded the habeas corpus, judicial
definition of the rights of person and property and
the education of the people in the support of these
enlarged liberties. They numbered unarmed hun
dreds. The Cossacks were again turned loose upon
them. They were beaten with whips like d*ogs.
Asia again answere/1 Europe with the knout and
sword, with the dungeon and banishment. The best
blood of a country is in its universities and institu- ,..
tions of learning. So it is in Russia, and that em
pire with her. own sword is opening her veins and
arteries and letting the red tide of her best life spill
in the mire of her streets.
The Holy Synod and the Council of the Czar do
not see it, but the students who were beaten and run
through and cowed or killed a year ago represent the
only principle and course of action by which her
dream of primacy can" be realized. This year they
rose again on the anniversary of the martyrdom of
a girl who was crushed by the hard hoof of the em
pire because she aspired to be a human being. '
Why, "under .the circumstances," should. Russia ex
pect to outrun and overrun the Angfo-Saxons in a
race, for the intellectual and commercial primacy of
the world? ; V;^.v
For a year the students have seemed cowed and
non-re'sistant. The Government flattered itself that
it' had driven desire'for the rights of man out of the
universities and*out of the empire. During that year
occurred Tolstoy's excommunication by. the Holy
Synod, and his practical outlawry in czardom. The
structure of autocracy was buttressed and strength
ened at all points, and the empire dreamed of vic
tory in the struggle for the world's commercial pri
macy that is on between the Muscovite and the
Anglo-Saxon. That dream, under the-circumstances,
is a peculiar delusion. Russia has a vast domain and
a vast population. Her dynamic resources are of im
posing dimensions. -But when has such a conquest
as she intends been made by a people to whom is de
nied the right of ownership of their own bodies, and
in whom expression of thoughts that are the founda
tion of manhood is treated as a crime deserving of
death?
: ,That is the Asiatic system. If Asia had permitted
free thought and let her people be free men, there
would to-day be no Europe. All the world would
bc.Asia.'But Asia, from Nebuchadnezzar to Haroun,
denied to man the rights that are the motive power
of all -progress. Therefore she crystallized, and stood
as still as the woman of Sodom who turned into salt.
Man made Europe that he might have scope and
verge for his.conscience and his individuality, and
though his march to full enfranchisement was long
and ids 'miles were marked by sacrifice, he has per
sisted, and his horizon has widened as he ap
proached it.
European Russia is still Asiatic. The spirit of
Rurik spans "the thousand years since he combined
the Tartar tribes and the Mongoloid peoples and
founded the empire. The German states have par
liamentary* government. Austria has a Parliament.
Italy; has a Parliament. Spain and Portugal have
Parliaments. France is a republic and England is
a constitutional \monarchy governed by the people
through a Ministry that_is only a committee of a
Parliament In all Europe dnly Russia and Turkey
are Asiatic still, with no popular feature in their ad
ministration and no recognition of the rights of man.
THE. will of. the?. Czar forbids assembling "of the
Russian people arid sternly represses discussion
of the autocracy. The - constitution- ofr the-
United : States especially protects the peaceable as
sembling and their right of petition. Only an occa
sional Funston rises to denounce: our enjoyment, of
this constitutional guarantee. Last year the
students assembled to discuss the bearing of. the col
lege curriculum upon the life of the people... They
were set upon by Cossack soldiers, beaten with
whips and put to the sword. Imprisonment and ban
ishment followed, and it was thought the aspirations
of that' intelligent class of Russians had- been -finally
suppressed. But when a desire. for. free. thought and
expression and for freedom of conscience has taken
possession-of a people it cannot be beaten out" of
them with the knout nor cut out of them with a
scimeter. x .

The article which Justin McCarthy har
written on the coming novelist recalls
the fact that there 'are fashions In novels
just a3 in everything else. Â£
A few years ago, it will be remembered,
the problem novel 6eld the field. Most
of these were written : hy women!. < Tha
fame of Robert LOuls Stevenson then
brought the adventure story into fashion.
Now. I find a great many books dealing
with the tragedy and comedy of the Lon
don . poor have been Â¦ having enormous
sales. This was the example set by
George Glsslng. which has been very suc
cessfully followed by Arthur Morrison,
Richard "Whiteing and Pett Ridge. At
any Â¦ rate, their -books have been having
surprisingly big ,sales. ' . .' .'.
It is .'perhaps.' curious that white' the
modern English drama is concerned
mostly with the aristocracy, such virile
novelists as Thomas Hardy, Glsslng, Bar
rle and the others already mentioned find
material for their stories in life's very
lowly, undistinguished persons.
An edition of George Eliot's famous
novel, "The Mill on the Floss," prepared

has been very unfortunate. The copy

tlon has been premature, and necessarily
the firm which published George Eliot's
books for her asserted their rights, with
the result that the edition disappears.

rascal. Dr. Sprigge, who is on the staff

Walter Besant, whose autobiography he

the Authors' Society.
Some years ago Mrs. Harcourt Wil
liamson edited , and arranged a "Book of
Beauty," so reviving an old literary fash
ion. The second portrait, on the sarno
lines, is now to be published. The volume

painters. The volume will also have arti
cles on society personalities and topics
concerning the year of the coronation.
Meakln, whose interesting book on the
Moors is just published, was for, some
years editor of the Times of Morocco,
which was founded by his father In 1884.
He made many journeys into the interior
disguised in native dress and using a
Moorish name. In this way he acquired
an exhaustive knowledge of the manner*
and customs of the country.
"I wonder," said a well-known Ameri
can, who/ when in England last sum
mer, visited Stratford-on-Avon, "you
don't have a magazine devoted to
Shakespeare and Shakespeare subjects."
He was but anticipating the event. aÂ»
there is to appear from Stratford-on-Avon
a new quarterly called The Shrine. It
will be" devoted mainly to subjects con
nected with Shakespeare and his birth
place. Elliot Stock will publish it in Lon
don. The first number will be ready on
Shakespeare' s : birthday, next . month.

it,- and has gathered in formation from
many books throughout which it has
been scattered. He has also gone to new
sources. He gives short histories, often
accompanied by portraits of book collec

< The Rev. Edgar Sheppard'a book, on
the history of St. James Palace is Veil
known. He has now finished a very-sim
ilar work upon the old palace of White
hall. Only the banqueting house of tho
palace remains, so its story, may be said
to have come to an end.
Dr. Sheppard says: "It Is- a curious
fact that the story, so far as I am aware,
has never been written In full and con
tinuous detail. It has been my aim to
supply such a narrative, and to glvef ! as
far as possible a complete record' of this
old palace." His materials for this pur
pose have been gathered from wide and
varied sources, including official docu
ments and records to which he has had
access.
Countess .Darnley is one of the authors

Wi W. Jacobs this year is publishing
two book#-"At Sunwich Port," during
the spring, and a volume of short stories
in the autumn.
Mr. Jacobs is a slight and fair man, and
looks considerably, less than his thirty
eight years. As in the case of many otu
ers, it was some time before his talent
was recognized by editors. The first of
the ."Many Cargoes" series of stories was
refused by thirteen editors before "finally
appearing In To-Day. Then, under tha
editorship of Mr. Jerome, who wrote ask
ing for more, Mr. Jacoos started the hu
morous exploitation of the Lower Thames.
One of the stories in "Many Cargoes" was
sent to the late James Payn, then editor of
the Cornhlll, and was refused by him. A
year or -two afterward Mr. Ryan recom
mended the completed ..volume for tho
Academy's prize for the' best books of tha
year. His unique knowledge of the Lower
Thames was acquired by him with a
small coaster which he possesses and
when he was living at Wapping, where
his father had a wharf. Two of his short
stories have been dramatized. Ho has
ideas of writing an original play.
Henry James, who was 111, Is now bet
ter. He has finished proofs of a novel
that will appear soon.
An interesting specimen of bookbinding
was sold at Christie's auction rooms re
cently. The volume is a seventeenth cen
tury manuscript containing a number of
transcripts and pieces in verse and prose,
by and relating to Lady Arabella Stuart.
The binding consists of very fine sheet
vellum, most beautifully â¢ cut with pen
knife in a pattern resembling fine point
lace, and laid over pink satin, varied
with blue. In two corners of e.ach cover
the initials "T. Y." Interlaced, occur.
There are traces on one side of the royal
arms of France and England quartered,
having at one time been illuminated on
a satin formed center. The design of tha
garter and the. crown and the motto
"Semper Eadem" are cut out in vellum.
The other side contains a device of a bird
rising from the ground with the motto,
"Je Fuy la Terre, et Cherch le.Clel."

China is a bigger country than Samoa, but not,
much more capable of. defense against f , the strong
and warlike friends who are now girding; her round
about with armies and navies and. talking loudly of
their agreement that she shall not'.be despoiled. All
the same, it will be well for the statesm-en' of China
tq study the recent history of Samoa with a good
deal of attention to its slightest details. â¢
tribute much to the hopes of, those who are look
ing for the coming of a political millennium. 'Least'
of all did it secure the territorial integrity of Samoa.
On the contrary~it led 'to quarrels, and finally to the
treatment of the islands as if they were spoils of war
instead of the pledges of friendship. So in the end
the Samoans were pronounced to be a conquered peo
ple, their islands were divided* and the joint govern
ment dissolved. / .
To this mutual good will among the nations aridi
common desire to promote the welfare of China thfcre
is but one parallel indecent history, and that is the
notable incident where the mutual good will of the
United States, -Great Britain and Germany for one
another and their common regard for the welfare of
the Samoans led the three nations to organize a joint
government- of those islands: It will be' remembered
thafthe joint government did not last longinor con-
declarations of love for one another and' of. high re- :
solve- to' treat China 'fairly .and keep her undivided.' : '"-'
, The British -and, Japanese, alliance was; the first oh
these formal manifestations 'of good will to be made
public. Russia immediately hastened to announce
that she received the news with gladness, and was
pleased to find the Rallies united in support of the very;
policy that Russia f had most at. heart. Shortly after
ward came the announcement that^-Russia and France
had' formed ; an alliance, not 1 to , oppose .Britain and"

" Dear Mris. Pinkham : â Before I knew of Lydia E. Pinkham**
Vegetable Compound I dreaded the approach of the time for my
menstrual period, as it would mean a couple of days in bed with intense
pain and suffering. I was under. the physicians care for over a year
without any relief, when my attention was called to Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound by "several of our Mormon women who had
been cured through its use. I began its systematic use and improved
gradually in health, and after the use of six bottles my health was com-
pletely, restored, and for over two years I have had neither ache or pain.
You have a truly wonderful remedy for women. Very sincerely yours,
Mrs. Hulda Jakehan, Salt Lake CJity, Utah."
O, my sisters, I do pray you to profit by Mrs. Jakeman's exper-
iences; just as surely as she was cured of the troubles enumer-
ated in her letter, just so surely will Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound cure every woman in the land who suffers from womb
troubles, inflammation of the ovaries, kidney, troubles, nervous
excitability, and nervous prostration ; remember that it is Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound that is curing women, and
don't allow any druggist to sell yon anything else in its place.

A most Important discovery has been
made after a year's patient laboratory
work aimed In a certain direction. It is
Kewbro's Herpicide, a preparation that
cures baldness, prevents falling hair and
epeedlly and permanently eradicates dan-
druff. These evils are caused by a germ
or parasite that burrows Into the scalp,
throwing up dandruff, as It seeks to sap
the life of the hair at the root. There's
no baldness without falling or thin hair,
no thin hair without dandruff, and no
dandruff If the germ is destroyed. New-
bro's Herpicide is the only preparation
that will do the work. Â¦ "Destroy tho
cause, you remove the effect."

â¢ Does anyone suppose that the young wife of President Jakeman, whoso
portrait we are permitted to publish, would allow us this great privilege if
she had not been so over- joyed at her own recovery that she now wants to be
of service to her suffering sisters ? No, indeed ! no money can purchase such
testimony, only a grateful heart full of a desire to help other sufferers could
induce a young woman of such high social position to allow her name to bo
used in connection with any remedy.
How is it possible for us to make it plainer that Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound will t positively help all sick women? All women
are constituted alike, rich and poor, high and low, â all suffer from the same
organio troubles. Surely, no one can wish to remain weak and sickly, dis-
couraged with life and no hope for the future when proof is so unmistakable
that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will cure monthly
sufferingâ all womb and ovarian troubles and all the ills peculiar to women.
If there is anything in your case about which yon would
like special advice, write freely to Mrs. Pinkham. She can surely
help you, for no person in America has such a wide experience in
treating female ills as she has had. Address is Lynn, Mass. ; her
advice is free and always helpful.

BENEFIT. ARRANGED FOR;
- SAN ~ FRANCISCO NURSEXiT
McEnerney said that he expected one
day to see a -law enacted which would
make cremation compulsory. He dis
cussed a' Boston case, in which it was
held that crowded cities had the right. to
prohibit burials, while the same privilege
was denied to sparsely settled communi
ties. The argument* will be resumed
Tuesday afternoon, when the matter will
be nnally submitted for decision.
It la established by abundant 'authority that
burials, may be prohibited In portions of muni
cipalities.* There is renam why this should
be the case. -The advance of urban -population
or the proximity of cemeteries to private real
donces demand their removal. It you can ex
clude cemeteries from one section "of the city
you can exclude them from another. The pro
hibition of burials in cities is a. law older than
the Christian era. It was one- of the laws
promulgated by the Twelve Tables that tha
dead could not be burled- within the walla' of
Rome. This was COO years before Christ. ' It
shows that the- abiding; .places of the living
and the dead should be widely, separated. -.-->
Â¦ The . very, authorities cited by' the learned
counsel on the othei-. side in -support of the
contention that the ordinance is unreasonable
admit the right of -municipalities to abolish
cemeteries. This may be. done not on the sole
ground that N the cemeteries are nuisances, but
on the additional ground that their abolish
ment is a proper . exercise of the police power,
of the legislative body of a municipality.. I
hold that this Dower has been conferred upon
the Hoard of Supervisors of San - Francisco,
and It Â¦ la conceded by the other side: that
municipalities have the right, to exercise -pow
ers conferred upon them by the Legislature.
Attorney McEnerney, who represents
the Board of . Supervisors, resumed his
argument and proceeded to show why in
his opinion the ordinance was valid, and
should be upheld. .He contended that
municipalities : were privileged \to exercise
the same police powers in matters affect
ing them that the Legislature has in
State matters. Resuming he said in part:
Considerable/interest is 'being taken in
the outcome of the litigation inalmuch
as a judgment of the court declaring the
ordinance valid willr close -the cemeteries.'
The case a't bar is the: appeal of George
K. Fletcher, superintendent of the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery, who was fined $100 for :
violating. the provisions of the ordinance.
Kvery effort is > being made by a strong
array of attorneys retained by the ceme
teries to have the judgment reversed and
the ordinance declared invalid. â¢

that since the passage of the old ordi
nance, which had been declared Invalid,
only one twenty-foot fence had been
erected in order to test the ordinance.
The improvement in property was lessen
ing the number of twenty-foot fences al

Lectures on Exclusion.
The Unity Club of San Francisco nave
a lecture last night at Golden Gate Hall.
The subject was "Chinese Exclusion From
the Chinese Standpoint." The lecture was
ably given by Ng Poon Chew. He sought
to Bhow why the Chinese should not be
excluded from the United States, and said
the Chinese question has been misinter
preted, mistaken and misunderstood. Con
tinuing, he said that since the Chinese
Jiave been assailed by most of the powers
of the world and incessantly harassed
they have been seeking other places In
which they might live In peace, and con
sequently come to the United States, the
freest country on the face of the earth.
Tills, along with the gold fever, the build-
Ing of railroads and the agricultural In
dustry, has been the greatest inducement
to Chinese to come to this country. They
are a necessity to the Industrial world, as
they can do work that the white man
cannot. The . country could absorb two
million yellow men to Its advantage.

a large audience took advantage of his
promise to deliver an opinion on tho
Boers. and the war. He said' that he had
not changed his opinion as expressed three
years ago and reminded his hearers that
In- this^ country every one has a right to
his opinion and the expression of his sym
pathies. As a student of history he could
say that the matter would be fought out
between the politician? of England and
the politicians of the Transvaal. He sub
mitted that no large empire was to be
appropriated. by a handful of people, and
he expressed it.asi his -opinion that God
never meant a feudalism of small nations.
He demonstrated the necessity for col
onizing . and the great good England had
done m that direction, giving- opportunr-'
ties to mankind that. the overcrowding
of the older countries, needed, and with
out which there would be untold suffer
ing in the world. He believed that no
gate should be .shut on those who were
willing to enter a country. He lauded the
pluck and heroism of the Boer and hoped
that an amicable settlement- between tho
English : and : the Â¦ Transvaalers would Â¦ soon
be effected, as they were really one stock;
with one religion. In conclusion he prayed
that the war would be ended wtlh honor,
to both sides. â¢ '

Court Continues Argument for a
Week.
Eeveral Affidavits Are Filed, but
To-day was the time set by Judge Og
den for a decision upon tne demurrer in
terposed by G. B. Daniels, Henry P. Dal
ton and the majority directors of the En
quirer Publishing Company to the original
OAKLAND, March 28.â Additional
charges were filed. to-day in. the
suit of D. Edward Collins against
G. B. Daniels, Dr. George (?. Par
Â» dee and Henry P. Dalton growing
out of the troubles of the Oakland En
quirer' . Publishing ;; Company. . : . _These
''charges 'took .the forrn'pf an'ijnended'a'nd".
-supplemental complaint filed by; Collins, in
Â¦which he' incorporates anqthef. series of
allegations in addition to the ones already
made. The most sensational of these
charges is that the Enquirer "Publishing
Company was used to borrow money .for
Henry P.' Dalton's owff use,' through" or-'
ders issued by Dalton as County Assessor
for printing to: be done at some tlxherin
the future, which; orders ."were discpunted
and cashed before the work was^.done.
The assertion Js j also , made that"- Dr.
George C. 1 Pardee paid off the Dariiels-
Enqulrer note. at' r the Central Bank: with
the money he raised at the Oakland'Bahk
of Savings. and that the'stock is now.un
der his control*' Attention is also called
to the statements of Dr. Pardee in his
deposition that he entered Into the nego
tiations for the purchase of the paper for
Daniels, while Hadley and I^each, with
whom he conducted the negotiations, were
given to understand that the paper was
being purchased by Dr. Pardee and Heriry
P. Dalton.
i .The.complalnt then sets forth the reor
ganization of the direct ory ' and the elec
tion of G. B. Daniels as general manager
The borrowing of *55,000 from the Centrai
Bank for the purchase of the 500 shares of
stock is cited, and Mr. Collins alleges that
neither Daniels nor Dfllton had the money
to, pay the interest upon i tho "notes. - He
also niakes the x follawirig revised charge
that, the | interest ': on the Daniels- Pardee-
Dalton note wa3 to be paid by the paper
through Diniels' 5500 salary: : â;â¢,. '
â¢ That said Daniels .had no means ". wherewith
to pay said interest, as this plaintiff Is informed
and believes, and. therefore alleges the Â¦ fact 'tn
be; and- further-, allege:*; that .said -Henry ' 1'.
Dalton, as -thla 'plaintiff is advised: and Â¦Â¦ be

had no means wherewith to pay said interest.",
That on or about December 13, 1S03,- as thin
plaintiff - J ls r.advljHsd :a"hd 'bejieves, and therefore
alleges tho fact to be, a fraudulent scheme and
conspiracy - was : concocted between said â¢ Henry

ious person* that the said Daniels
was a. mere tool and employe and
trustee of natd George C. Pardee and
Henry P. Dalton m the corporation
defendant, and that they believed in
fact that the said George C. Pardee
and Henry P. Dalton were the renl
owners of snid Ktoolc; that no posi

cerning unid matter by tilts-plaintiff
until within the three months lnst

George C. Pardee did testify that he

The. amended complaint -recites many
additional facts 'in regard to the owner
ship of the stock pf the Enquirer, facts
that. have evidently been secured from the
book3 of the corporation and which are
more, in detail and more accurate than
the alleg-ations in the original document.
The,ownershipjs said t* be^liyided as fol-
I0W5: Five hundred shares to G. B. Dan
iels, less one share each for two dummy
Sectors; 180 shares to D. Edward Col

TV&nU f S5 l * rea \ Â° Wner3 Of the stock -
Th? Ln^H mereIy * * trus tee for them,
ihe complaint contains the followinc
statement, based upon Dr. George C. Par
dee s deoosltion:
Real <"rwnersb.ip of Stbclc
complaint of Collins. J. B. Richardson
representing .Collins, applied early in the
day for permission to file an amended
complaint, which was granted. The docu
ment Wjas then placed 'on record and Judge
O&den. was notified of this fact. As. the
new, -complaint superseded the one to
which the -defendants, had demurred the
demurrer fell and -Judge Ogden ordered
It -stricken from the calendar. - Â¦
-This puts the suit -where It originally
was at the. filing of the nrst complaint.
There will probably be more demurrers
and .more attempts to take, depositions
before Superior Judges and a general con
tinuation of the struggle that has got be
yond the cohnnes of Oakland and is inter
esting the entire State.

The situation is being thoroughly can
vassed by the local leaders, and they are
in communication with the Amalgamated
Association of Street Railroad Employes.
Two more employes were discnarged
yesterday, this time by Manager Morrow
from the 1-arkin-street branch of the
Sutter-street line. This served to increase
sull further the dissatisfied gripmen,
motormen and conductors.
Mayor Schmitz conferred with repre
sentatives of the street railway employes
last night and urged moderation. The
men finally decided to accept the Mayor's
views and not precipitate a strike at this
time. They realize that the new owners
of the Market-street system are not re
sponsible for the acts of the old company.
It was therefore decided to wait -until the
new owners are in full control, when the
grievances of the men will be formally
presented. It .is believed, that, there will
l>e no difficulty in reaching a satisfactory
understanding.
This effort also failed. The Attorney
General said that Duane was a financier,
not a railroad man. and that he had no
authority to commit the corporation to
any policy In its relations to employes.
He said that Duane was' personally
anxious that there ehould be no friction.
Ford had no doubt that when the svndi
cate assumed active control the employes
would be iatisiied with the treatment ac
corded them.
Jtichard Cornelius, Andrew Sorenson
and W. J. GoIdkuSil were present -to repre
sent the new union of me employes and
Secretary Ed Rosenberg of the Labor
Council v/as also in attendance. These
four were very much disgruntled at
puane's refusal to be present at least
and hear their grievances stated. Rosen
berg, however, counseled moderation, and
said that hasty action shouid be avoided,
ilayor Schmitz, though discouraged at
the failure of his efforts at mediation,
said he still hoped that the new owners
Â¦would speedily coirsent to mtet the em
ployes' committee. It was nnaliy decided
to make another attempt to secure im
inedia.te consideration of the employes'
complaint that men were being dls-"
charged for joining the union. The Mayor
agreed to consult with Attorney General
l<ord, the new corporation's counsel, and
learn if he could not induce IJuane Â¦ to
meet the committee.
James M. Duane, representing the Bal
timore'."syndicate, 'ailed to attend the
proposed conference with repreiientatives
of the aggrieved street railroad cmp.oyes

Mayor Schmitz that he did not feel justi
fied in interfering at the present time in
a detail of management. He wrote that

to the judgment of the old management.

Â¦;: Mrs.' Jerome .Ellison 'of Wheeling, W. - Va.:,
writes :Â». ."I ; suffered from catarrh nearly: my
.whole life and last winter my two children also
suffered from catarrhal colds and sore throat so
much they were out of school a large portion oi
the winter. 'My brother, who -was cured of ca-
tarrhal deafness by using Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, urged me to try them so much that I did
bo and am I truly thankful . for I what they have
done for 'myself and my . children." - I always
keep a box of. the tablets 'In the house and at
the first appearance of a cold or sore throat wo
nip jit; in. the bud and catarrh -is no longer a
household affliction with us." Â¦Â¦' :â¢ . Â¦.Â¦.;..
â¢â¢Full clzed package3 : of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-'
lets are sold for. fifty, cents at all druggists. -';
; . -Dr. J.' J.-Rel tiger of Covington,' Ky., says: "1
suffered from .catarrh in my head and threat
every fall, with stoppage of the nose and Irrita-
tion- in, the throat affecting my voice. and often
extending: to "the stomach, causing catarrh oi
the stomach. I bought a fifty cent package of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at. my druggist's, car-
ried them. in rriy pocket and used them faithful-
ly, and the way in which they cleared my head
and throat was certainly remarkable. I had no
catarrh last winter and spring and consider my-
self entirely. . free from any. catarrhal trouble."
They contain no cocaine: nor. opiate, and are
given to little children with entire safety and
benefit. ~ . - ;
; Â¦â¢-' j Physicians, I who 'Â¦Â¦ formerly j depended upon is-
halers, - sprays . and local washes -or ointments,
now use. Stuart's Catarrh :. Tablets because, as
one of the" most prominent stated, these -tablets
contain Â¦ in , pleasant, convenient form all the
really efficient catarrh remedies, such as red
gum, blood root and similar antiseptics.' . /
To be sure a large amount of advertising was
necessary In the first Instance, to bring the rem-
edy to the attention of. the public, but everyone
familiar with the subject knows that advertis-
inff alone never made . any article permanently
Successful. | It must have In addition absolute,
undeniable merit; and this the new catarrh cure
certainly possesses in a marked degree. Â¦
year Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, vthe new catarrh
cure, has met with such success that to-day it
can be found in every drug store throughout
the United States and Canada.

weakens the body and de- â¢
grades the mind. It saps
the nervous strength that
is the source of all health,
and perverts the functions
of every organ. Because
of its stubborn nature, it is"
often called incurable. This
is not true. There is one
medicine that never fails to
check the nervous spasms
and give new strength to
the entire system.
"Our baby boy had epileptic spasms
and the physicians were unable to do
anything to help him. "We heard of

NEW YORK. March 2S. â Bradstreet's to
morrow will say:
Trade activities have shifted from first to
second hands this week. Wholesale and Job
bing distribution of dry goods, clothing, hats
and cape, millinery and ehoes has been rather
quieter, as was only natural, in view of the
culmination of the spring demand before
Easter. Retail distribution, favored by spring
v.-cather, has been very active East and West,
with a fair business at the South.
Among the industries new demand for iron
end steel has on the whole been lees active.
production and shipment have gone for
ward at undimlnished epeed. The building
trades have taken a decided spurt in activity.
Lumber is active at all markets at higher prices
than ruled a year ago. The edge has rather
been taken off cotton and cotton goods prices
by the reaction in the raw material and the
talk of further labor unscttlement, but values
at a whole are Eteady.
Aggressive strength ia prices is chiefly mani
fested by hoj product?, which, it is declared,
have been manipulated by packers. A more
reasonatale explanation, however, is that the
high prices tor beef and mutton have largely
diverted consumption tc hog products. Milder
Â¦weather has relieved the strain on the coal
trade somewhat, but strike talk has prevented
weakness in price*. -^
Rather leas activity in iron and steel Is
noted, but no loss of price firmness Is observ
able The peculiar situation of- the foundry
plgiron market is shown by the fact that prices
of that grade arc *l higher per ton than Bes
eemer. Finished iron and steel has been active,
Implement and wagon manufacturers buying
heavily of steel bars, which are nominally $2
per ton higher. Despite the fact that tin plate
nillU are- booked for five months ahead, th
leadirg interest continues to take orders at S4
tier brx. Testimony to the activity in hard
ware is well nigh unanimous. Chicago reports
demand active beyond all precedent. Jobbers
ir. cutlery and hardware at New York report
Inability to secure supplies fast enough. Wool
Ik qultt. Mills are busy on previous orders.
Men's wear clothing is dull. Boots anfl shoes
are dull and new business Is smaller. Leather
is quiet and hides are dull and easy. .
The leading cereals are Irregularly lower
after an apparently futile effort at bulling
,^iefs. Last week'e decline brought in con
'Tderable export business in wheat and some
/ revival was reported even in corn. Steady
buying and talk of a squeeze In corn were re
flected eympathrtlcally in wheat. The talk
of a corner in July was aided by the small
supplies of contract grade*, but the tendency
trÂ» take profits in anticipation of the holidays
Â¦weakened prices, which generally closed lower
than a week ago. Wheat crop advices have on
the whole been very jrood. though Isolated re
ports of carnage In Kansas and Oklahoma have
be*n received. Thes*. 'however, do not agreo
with Bradstreet'* report of liberal rains in the
Bouthwett and the Improved feeling in business
circles generally in that section.
Wheat, including flcrur, exports for the week
aggregate 2.1)04.110 bushels, agalnet 4.326.304
lapt week and 4.494.C33 in this week last year.
Whoat exports July 1. 1901, to date (thirty-nine
viertu) aggregate 104.399,041 bushels, agalnet

With the exception of small seed Burbanks
all descriptions of old Potatoes are firm at the
quoted prices. Oregon Potatoes are cleaning

EAN FRANCISCO. March 2S â 5 p. m.
The following are, the seasonal rainfalls to
data, as compared with those of same date
last season, and rainfall In last twenty-four
hours :
and 31.5 per cent over 1S90.
Demands for an eight-hour day after May 1
by the blast furnace men was the most dis
turbing feature in the iron and steel industry,
and this is not causing much alarm, as an
agreement will probably be reached during the
intervening month. Production is now beyond
all previous records and the movement of coke
is ample, although the early opening of lake
navigation may withdraw some of the trans
porting f admits which cannot well be spared.
IJuylng has been notably active in bars for Im
plement makers, and producers have sold their
entire outputs so far ahead that new business
is not. nouzht. Many plans for immediate
structural work have been abandoned owing to
the insufficient supply of available material.
On the other hand, there are reports of resell-,
ing contracts for rails and other sullies by
consumers who have secured larger deliveries
than will be needed. The appearance of this
spculatlve element would be ominous if quota
tions -were more excefnively inflated. Aside
from the advance In bar iron' at Plttsburg to
518 and foundry Iron at .Chicago to $1S CO,
there are no special â¢ price changes. Southerlt
furnaces having decided to postpone the con
templated advance, . ... Â¦ .
A severe reaction occurred In cotton, due
entirely to the excessive speculative purchases
which made the market topheavy. A slight
recovery in coffee from the bottom price mu6t
be attributed to aggressive option buyinir, as
the statistical position Is not Improved. Brazil
receipts exceedlns last year's high record to
date by over a third. A temporary reduction
in refined sugar was quickly restored, as th?
market for raw' grades became very strong.
Meats again advanced' in the face of easier
grain, a helpful Influence being the largest sin
gle order ever placed for the British army.
Weakness appeared In the cereals early In
the week, when there was a certain unanimity
about encouraging weather reports and in
creased acreaee. Subsequently there' was a
partial .recovery owing to lers cheerful news
from Kansas and Oklahoma, but the net re
sult for the week was a decidedly lower range
of prices. Wheat experts materially decllnM
from the satisfactory record of 4.U57.ti25 bush
els last week to only :t.CSS,lM2 bushels this
I wc-eK, which comparts with 3.iÂ»30,S32 in the
Â¦ tame week last year. There was a decrease
in Western receipts to 2,747,004 bushels,
Hirainst 4,OT>2.50S bushels a year ago, but the
difference in arrivals of corn was less striking.
According: to an analysis of the official returns
. by r. I^Iverpool authority, there will be only
13,000,000 bushels of wheat In this country at
the close of the crc? year, but the statement
is based on exports for the last four months
of half as much as the record-breaking ship
ments of the preceding eight months, which fs
exceedingly improbable. A further alteration
in the flsrures should be made to allow for the
underestimate of the total crop.
Failures for the week numbered 200 in the
United States, against 200 last year, and 22 in
Canada, against 29 last year.

BUSINESS; CHANCESâ Continued^
WE have for .sale rights for the States of Cal-
ifornia, Oregon and Washington for. the. best
lockcd-wlre ience device ever patented. The
owner of the patent is a practical ranch man
, who has _Ou miles. of barbwlre fence in the
Vanhandle. and who Is now going over the
entire fence system of his ranch, putting tn
the 'stays with this locked-fence, device. The
device has taken like wildfire in the Eastern
States. The State of Iowa alone sold for
$10,000. We have samples \ot the device at
our olfice. where It can be seen. The prln-,
cipal advantage of this fence device is that
it makes a fence that is almost Indestruct-
ible; no power can move the stays when put
on. with our patent fastener and .-. patent
wrench. If this device were adopted In Cali-
fornia It certainly would revolutionize fenc-
â¢ Ing. The fence Is cattle-proof, and by put.
1 ting in enough stays you can fence against
" the smallest animals. The device can be used
on ornamental fences or for office wire work.
The wrench and clips and possibly - some
models of t^e fence can be. seen 'at the City
Wire Works, . on Main st., between Seventh
and Eighth. Mr. Blescar, thi proprietor,
will be gl&d to explain its use. MINING IN-

SAN RAF^ ~:L, March 28.^John '- Enos
was arrested to-day at the instigation of
the Marin County Game * Warden for al
lowing deer hounds to pursue deer out of
season. Game Warden Robinson for some
time has been annoyed by men" from other
sections coming to this county and hunt
ing deer out of season. He proposes to
put a stop, to all such operations. There
is a State law prohibiting dogs chasing
deer out of season, and on this charge
several arrests will be made. Mr. Enos
appealed before -Judge Hodden and paid
a flno of $30. ' .
Violates the Game I*aw.
The fish were first dsicovered by boys
who used hand lines, and small hooks for
tho capture of flounders. The youngsters
hooked bass which easily "walked away"
with their light tackle. Twenty basa were
taken yesterday, some of which scaled
fifteen pounds. Those who fished with
hand lines were "cleaned out" time-- and
agraln. Mr. Wicker- and a friend landed
two fish of large size. James Watt and
Colonel Parrlsser â¢. secured two fish and
lost one large one which Mr. Watt failed
to bring to gaff. Two young men who
were "green" at the game lost quite a
number of fish, but managred to bring
to boat five fine* bass. Those who fished
with hand lines from the shore retired
without securing a fish.
The bass, it is said, frequent the lake
for the purpose of depositing their spawn,
but old and experienced anglers contend 1
that the fish, having practically "cleaned
out" the clam necks on the mud flata
outside the lake, are waxing fat on their
new find within the lake. Doubtless when
the fish discover clam necks scarce they
will hunt new beds. ,
On Sunday a large delegation of anglers
from this city will try their luck in bait
fishing for bass. Strong tackle is neces
sary to success.
The best fishing on Sunday, it is be
lieved, will be from 4 p. m. until dark.
The beat fishing is enjoyed when < tha
tide is about half in and also on the slack,
although occasionally fish are taken at
low water. Yesterday twenty boats were
engaged, and as each boat was occupied'
for at least five hours the inference is
plain that the boatmen must have
made a nice penriy out of the fraternity.
This order of things will continue as long
as the bass freauent the lake. . - Â¦
The striped bass are funning In \ Lake
Merritt, near Oakland, and-thÂ«i lake is
crowded daily with boats laden with ama
teur fishermen. , A charge of 50 cents an
hour is made by: the- boatmen, who are
reaping a harvest for the time being..

ation shown t6 both parties after the af
fair came before their notice, and the
really clever and dignified way some of
the Kastern papers have handled it. I feel
that had the editors been handling such
a case involving their own family or per
ents they would not have shown more
consideration than they, have shown Ma
rion Faversham and me. Imprimatur."
Â¦ v "If the divorce ; has "been granted then
I am very â¢ happy, and I feel sure that
Marion Faversham is also happy on ac
count of being able to obtain the divorce
so easily and without any contest, pub
licity or expense.' It was a matter of life
and death to both of us that this divorce
should take place: Â«
"My divorce is no more mysterious than
others that the papers have handled late
ly. It was arranged between Marion Fa
versham and her advisers and myself that
I should give some grounds. I arranged
itâ the poor/ : mystical correspondent's
name shall be told when I come to New
Yorkâ all the details of the terms of the
divorce I practically arranged myself. So
all. these, stupid stories and Insinuations
from certain newspapers are of their own
manufacture. I shall thank the Herald
for a correct version of my part of the
affair. WILLIAM FAVEKSHAM."

"Do you know what the packing cases

sioned by some charitably .disposed people
to find-out if the, young "couple , was Re
serving of assistance and; they would de
fray, any expenses toward, supporting
them., till, a position was obtained for the
husband.' ' ' . 1 " 'â¢.
Lawrence * 1 Smith, 130S Hayes street,
owner of .<the< stolen wheel, was at the
Hall of Justice ready to- swear to a com
plaint against Young, but after Kelly had
a talk with-him'he was willing to take no
action ' against him, if the police advised
him that; war. > . * \, .,
Kelly, accompanied by Young and his
wife and Smith, waited upon Captain Sey
mour.'and Kelly explained the position of
affairs and asked that. Young be given, a
chance to 1 show, his manhood. Smith said
that he had no desire to prosecute Young,
and I as j he ; had not been :, booked for the
offense -the captain allowed him to go
with' a' friendly admonition to keep him
self out of trouble in- the future.
Youngand his": wife were, then taken, by
Kelly to his office and arrangements. were
made to provide them- with :a home, and
every effort will be made to procure a sit
uation '- for the; husband:' so- that 'he can
properly support his wife- till she is out of
her trouble.. She is'only 18 years of age
and- he is 22. â¢ It is expected.that Young's
parents,* who' were bitterly opposed to the
marriage, will now bestow the parental
blessing upon the young, couple. ..:.
Detectives Crockett and Coleman went
with Karns to 35 South Park with the
warrants and Davis and Mrs. Karns were
there. As soon as Karns saw his wife he
burst into tears and told- Davis that he
alone " was to â¢ blame -for the trouble. He
and Davis stepped into a room anu had a
short conversation, after which l Karns
told the officers he did not want the war
rants served, but the couple were taken
to the City Prison and booked. Both Da
vis and the woman declined to make any
statement. â¢Â¦--â¢'.
Karns continued his search and notified
all the branches of the order of trainmen
that Davis was personating him and ask
ed ; that he be . advised if Davis should
make his appearance seeking for employ
ment.", Karns'was notified some days ago
that a man representing himself as Karns
had called at the office of the local branch
here and was living at 35 South Park. - He
at once started for this city -and -arrived
Thursday night. '
H. B. Karns, after searching for his
wife and the man she eloped with ; for
eighteen months, located them at 35 South
Park Thursday night, soon after he had
arrived 'her from Solomon. Kans. He se
cured a warrant' yesterday from Judg9
Cabanlss for the arrest of his wife, Mrs.
Minnie Karns, and Arthur T. Davis.
Karns is a. member of the Brotherhood
of Railway Trainmen* and ." lived , with his
wife at Solomon, Kans. They had been
married about : nine years, when,. in Sep
tember.- 1000, she deserted him. Â¦ A- few
days before this occurred Arthur T. Da
vis, who lived in a town- a few miles from
Solomon, deserted his wife and five young
children, and Karns, owing to the friend
ship that existed between his - wife and
Davis, suspected that -she had gone to
join him.
He made diligent inquiry and located
them at the Needles. Cal, where they
were living "as husband and wife.
Mrs. Karns had â¢ taken away, with
her ,* Karns'.' policy of life insur
ance ' and Â¦ other " papers, among them
his certificate as a member of the
brotherhood, and Davis had been passing
himself oft as Karns, thereby securing
employment. as a. trainman. Karns wired
to have them arrested and it was done,
but Davis showed the certificate belong
ing to Karns and asserted that he was
Karns. defying the authorities to prove
the contrary. Karns hurried to the
Needles,' but to his chagrin discovered
that the couple had been released and had
fled. .,..-,
