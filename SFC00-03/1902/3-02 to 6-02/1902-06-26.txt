LONDON, June* 25.â The story of the
King and the Epsom gypsy is being re

was supposed not to have known his Ma

fall short of his ambition the last mo

SCENE IN SICK ROOM AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
The first sign of this came to-day, when
the Senate Committee on Patents reported
favorably a bill extending for seventeen
years the Bowers patents for hydraulic
dredging. Firms In this country who hold
licenses under Alphonso B. Bowers for the
exclusive use cf his patents have formed
a combination and this will practical
ly Rive them a monopoly of dredging work
on the canal.
It was to be expected that the proposed
expenditure of between $150,000,000 and
$200,000,000 for construction of an isthmian
canal would result in various schemes be
ing presented to Congress for special priv
ileges to contractors.
Â¦ So anxious were the Senate and Houss
conferees to reach an agreement that
would not allow of unnecessary discus
6ion and possible delay that little cffoit
was made by the House conferees-- to
amend the Epooner bill. Hepburn sug
gresleO an amendment limiting to six
taonths the time within which the Pan
ama title must be perfected, but when it
vas found this might involve further dis
cussion in tbe Senate the amendment was
net pressed and the Spooner substitute
was asreed to entire.
ALL SPEED IS DESIRED.
"My own candid, views are that other
complications surrounding- Panama titles,
many legal and diplomatic difficulties in
Ore tray, will be found insurmountable ob
structions by the President and his ad
visers so that it will be necessary for
him to choose .the Nicaragua route after
all. However, the ouestion of the route
Is subordinate to the larger question of
a ranal. but we have the appropriation.
arid after al! these years 1 cannot but look
with pleasure upon such a result."
"It was for this reason that I held out
In the Senate to the last in favor of this
route. But when the Senate ence adopted
the Spooncr substitute, knowing that its
provisions meant the construction of a
csnal. I urged its adoption in conference
and cannot ray that I am dissatisfied
wit IT the result. The President is em
powered .to build a canal. Not only that,
but Jt is mandatory upon him to proceed
at once, if not by one route, by the
ether.
ROUTE IS SECONDARY.
"Personally I would prefer a canal by
the Panama route. My own State of Ala
txutia -n-crÂ«ri-rroTTt~wrorc^t>y Panama -tV*n"
by Nicaragua. Nicaragua means a better
canal for the whole country from almost
every point of view, especially military
and naval.
"I feel certain that this bill means an
American canal without further* delay,"
said Morgan. "Furthermore, I can say
without qualification that I think the bill
passed by the Senate and agreed to in
conference to-day means nothing Ices
than a canal by the Nicaragua route.
With the signing of the conference re
port Senator John T. Morgan completed
the most important labor of more than
A quarter of a century of his public life.

"Well, perityphlUtls Is frequently caused
by a little particle of food such as a grape
pit or porition of a nut shell lodging in the
appendix. Whatever the cause, the con
ditions are enhanced by high nervous
temperament and by excitement.";
these symptoms might pass away, as they
often do under the influence of rest and
care, till the sudden accession of the
symptoms indicated the presence of an
abscess of considerable size."
Another doctor says: "Until the tubes
draining the abscess have been removed!
It Is impossible to feel certain that the-
King will pull through. All Indications of
complications are often masked until the
post mortem examination. There are
many cases on record where the disease
has been discovered only after death from
some extraneous cause. As to the neces
sity of an operation, it is true that in
many cases of appendicitis in the young
the patient may recover without an oper
ation, but the King: Is not young, nor was
his Majesty, I believe, in the best of phys
ical condition. It was imperative. If thÂ»
life of the King was to be saved."
"How was the disease brought on, and
why was it not diagnosed earlier?"

Eighteen days' subsistence on dog meat
was the experience of J. H. Sprague, who
brought in on the steamer Dora on Thurs
day morning 400- pounds of mail by the
Iliamna route. Sprague left Inamna Bay
on March 1 with the mail, and expe
rienced hardships from which few other
men would haV6 survived. When Spragua
left Iliamna he weighed 185 pounds; when
he weighed himself again at Llnd's trad
ing post he tipped the beam at 115 pounds.
For -fourteen days previous to taking
to dog meat Sprague and a man 'named
Mclnnis, the sub-mail contractor, had
lived on stale fish. Heavy storms pre
vented them reaching a point where food
could be obtained. Finally they were
found by'E. C. Hill of the Trans-Alaska
Company and F. Carlson Hill* made a
trip of fifty =mlles and return and pro
cured some beans, bacon and flour for
the starving men.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., June 25.â At a

the appointment of professor of mining

by John Hays Hammond, a graduate of
the Sheffield Scientific School in the class
of 1876.
An American syndicate, has applied for
a concession to build a railway .from
Peking to a point on the Yangtse opposite
Kiukang and has offered a sum of twelve
hundred thousand taels for the- Iwo park
should the concession be Â¦ granted.-- The
Empress Dowager has signified her con
sent, provided that the syndicate is really
prepared to put up the. capital necessary
for building the road. Concessions have
been granted for two other roads that
would serve the same purpose.
Another American Syn'dicatfe is^'sald'to'
be seeking & charter for a line from Amoy
to Hankow and a high official is reported
to be supporting the application.
The cavalry having retired, the artillery soon
male it too hot for the insurgents, who finally
fled in confusion toward the south. The city
of Xankuughsien before its capture by the in
surgents made a very brave and desperatr
stand, its trenches being choked with dead
tnd wounded before the rebels would flee from
the troots.
The insurgents rushed forward bravely but
rashlyto the attack, but were stopped half
way by a stream of bullets, shot and shell
froru the trooDe, who had halted and taken
advantage of every cover at hand. Then there
was a faltering in the insurgent ranks, who.
seeing a cavalry brigade deploying to take
them on the flanks, wavered and broke, mak
ing- for tlielr wailed camps, but the cavalry was
on them before half of them got within 300
yards of shelter and a massacre ensued. Those
who had got into their trenches and camps,
however, rallied, and by their fire drove off the
cavalry and covered the retreat- of their sur
vivlnc comrades.
An official report says that 21,000 impe
rial troops defeated 22,000 rebels near Nan
kunghsien, the fight lasting seven hours.
The report continues: -
From latest accounts obtained from reliable
sources in the -north it is asserted that the
news given cut by the officials at Paoting-fu
that tha victories of Viceroy Yuan'g troops,
and, we may add, the massacres perpetrated
by them in the dictricUs of Chuluhsien, Kuang
teunghsten and Weihsien have "quite pacified
them" is a mere lie t ion, and that In epite of
the many recent defeats ot the rebels their
lanks are beinx constantly reinforced, and a
determined front is in consecuence yet pre
sented against the Government. In view at
this the latter have been compelled to retire
to the vicinity of the cities of Chenting, Bhunto
and JCakunehsien. where many of the regi
ments are beinz reorganized by Viceroy Yuan's
orders. The majority of these troops have
been charted with wholesale plundering and
maltreating the inhabitants el the peaceful
districts through which they had to pass when
en route to the disturbed districts,- and, fur
thermore, when in the rebel territory with
bavins: DiHaued, burned and destroyed no less
than thirty-sevijn rjÂ»ud-walled towns and vil

The Portland -.was last reportedly the
Nome -City, when the latter sighted .her
in the icepack offCape Prince of .Wales,
being rapidly carried toward the Arctic.
The steam -â¢.. schooner Jeanie was seen
about the same time by ; ther steamer Elk
near. Nunivak. Island. _
When the Ohio Bailed the United States
steamship Thetis had been out more than
a week in search of the two^ craft, and
the. steamer Dora was dispatched from
Nome to'assist in the search two days
before the Ohio' left that harbor.
There- is some fear, at Nome that the
Jeanie may be lost. A .report to that
effect, '. coming in a ; rather roundabout
way, was* brought from Nome by _ the
Ohio. The report was brought to Nqme
from Nunivak Â¦ Island by some- Indians
about June. 16. On account of the round
about-way in which it came and the im
possibility of .'obtaining first hand verifi
cation of :it, Â¦ the report is not given the
fullest; credence at Nome. But the fact
that. the .Jeanie is unreported, though
having been out of Seattle since May 1,
lends -color-. to the story. . â ,"-Â¦".
Sofar as the. officers of the Ohio were
able' to reoort* the, Jeanie had not. been,
sighted since she sailed from this- port on
May 1- She : apparently, did "not- stop at
Dutch Harbor on \the way north, but put

.that she encountered the ice^in formida

PHYSICIANS
STILL HOLDING
OUT THE FACTS
A feature among the endless expressions
of anxiety concerning the King received
from all parts of the woÂ»ld Is the ex
tremely sympathetic tone of the Irish Na
tionalist press in expressing its fervent
hope for his Majesty's recovery.
The Times this morning says:
"King Edward saw all his children yes
terday, and slept comfortably during the
day. He was in good spirits, and took a
bright and hopeful view of his case, a
view which is shared by all those around
him. The hope is expressed by those
most competent to express an opinion that
if .the progress hitherto made is maintain
ed the King will be sufficiently well for
the coronation to occur next August.
"The question then would arise whether
the ceremony should . be performed then
or after the holidays, in September or Oc
tober. Judicious people will disregard all
flying rumors and place reliance on the
official reports. We are assured that the
bulletins neither extenuate nor exagger
ate the seriousness of the case."
result of his Majesty's illness. The doc
tors had the case of the late President
McKinley in mind, and in view of the fact
that the crisis has not yet passed, they
were determined to couch the bulletins in
the most guarded language so that the
hope of the public should not be unduly
buoyed up.
Lord Salisbury also was deeply affected.
Being shelved in order to make way for
her son evidently brought the whole trag
edy of her lot vividly before the Queen's
mind for the first time. Her devotion to
the King since his illness has touched
everybody about the palace, for it Is
kr.ov.-n that she realized keenly that his
altitude regarding the arrangements for
the coronation greatly increased the wor
ry which contributed to his breakdown.

Â¦wonderful composure up to that point,

that the Cabinet had decided that a Re

terday's developments. While the
barriers around Westminster Abbey have
been removed the decorations are being
completed for the benefit, to-mofrow and
Sunday, of the crowds. The" demolition
of the stands has begun and progresses
slowly. The hotels and provision dealers
are hit the hardest. Thousands of pounds
of perishable food of the most expensive
varieties are crowding every refrigerator
in London, while orders for many tons
more were telegraphically canceled yes
terday and will remain a source of liti
gation or compromise. The caterers of
the fashionable West End establishments
have already announced that they are
willing to share the losses of their pa
trons who had given large orders for
delivery to-morrow and Friday. Few of
the caterers or hotels availed themselves
of the insurance, the recently offered
Lloyd rate of ten per cent being con
sidered too high. Many proprietors of
reviewing stands were thus protected.
But the important question remains as
to whether the money paid for seats will
necessarily be .refunded. Only; a few
seats of nearly half a million were sold

New York Medical Journal from Its Lon
don correspondent, whom they consider
the highest medical authority in Great
Britain and who is in intimate ; touch
with everything that transpires at the
bedside of the .King:
The King's disease Is perltyphllltls following
cold contracted nine days previously. His
symptoms became rather acute a week agro. but
had subsided, and It was hoped that he would,
go through the coronation ceremony. Owing to
a sudden exacerbation early Tuesday morning
an operation was decided upon at- 10 o'clock
and the operation was performed at noon on
Tuesday by Sir Frederick Treves. the anes
thetic being administered by Dr. Frederick
Hewitt. The abscess was opened around . the
caecum, the pus evacuated and thÂ« cavity
drained. There was no resection of the bowel,
the newspaper reports that tubing was required
to preserve the continuity of the intestine be
ing entirely misleading. The recovery from,
anesthesia was satisfactory; the patient passed
a restless night, succeeded by improvement,
his condition being favorable on "Wednesday at
nocn. MWM|
At the Carlton Hotel, that clearing
house of rumors through which filters the
gossip of Europe, it has Just been reported
that a cable has been sent to Washington
by a Peer close to the King's household to
prepare for the worst. It is impossible to
find any one close to the royal family or
any one whose position at court gives
weight to his opinion, who does not be
lieve the King's condition most serious.
Yet, in spite of all this, the doctors, issue
reassuring bulletins, as if really the royal
patient was progressing satisfactorily.
Mr. Balfour makes a similar statement
in Parliament. No temperature, respira
tion or pulse is given,' only bare details.
All inquirers, especially from the news
papers, are treated as interlopers.
In spite of all secrecy, I learn from two
excellent sources that the operation was
not performed, as reported in the official
bulletins, at noon yesterday, but at half
past 6 o'clock in the morning, and that the
public was not taken into the confidence
of the King's physicians until they felt
the operation was a success. I also learn
that at 3 o'clock this morning the King
had a very serious relapse and that the
physicians in attendance during the
night sent for their colleagues to come to
the palace immediately. Fortunately the
King rallied very quickly. This rumor
traveled fast, as all rumors travel now.
Again the correspondent sought official
information and again it was refused him.
But the inquiry evidently bore fruit, for
within half an hour afterward a bulletin
was Issued supplementary, to the one
which had begn announced as the last for
the night, making an explicit statement
that the King had not only made satisfac
tory progress, but that he had slept for
several hours during the day. that he
complains little of discomfort and is more
cheerful and adding tbat "his Majesty
is doing well." â¢.

Gentlemen:â I had been a sufferer
from kidney trouble for about 8 years
with pain in side, back and head. About
6 or 8 months ago I concluded to try
a bottle of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root.
To my surprise I experienced a decided
relief before I had taken half of the bot-
tle, and one morning passed a gravel
stone as large as a pea, which I still
have in my possession and will be
pleased to show to any one who doubts
the efficacy of this wonderful remedy.
One month ago, finding some of the
old symptoms returning, I purchased a
50c bottle of Swamp-Root at Dr.
Morey's Drug Store, and before I had
taken one- fourth of it I found ' in the
vessel which I had voided during the
night a teaspoonful of small gravel
stones and sand, the passing of which
was immediately followed by relief.

Mercur is the western terminus of the
Bait Lake and Mercur Railroad, situated
fifty-eight miles southwest of Salt Lake
City. In the old days it was a silver
camp. Finally it was abandoned and re
mained in a deserted state until the cya
nide process of extracting gold from low
grade ore was given to the world. Then
ilercur became a lively camp and was flu
ally incorporated in 1890. It is famous as
the home of the noted Mercur and Golden
Gate mines. The town enjoyed the repu
tation of being the most moral and quiet
mining camp on the continent. The cen
sus of 1900 fixed its population at 235L
Governor Wells, Mayor Thompson of
Salt Lake, Oregon Short Line Railway of
ficials and a number of prominent Salt
Lake citizens late this afternoon arranged
for a special train with needed supplies,
which left Salt Lake early this evening
for the stricken town.
Shortly after the fire broke out it was
realized that the entire town was in dan
ger and immediately the greatest confu
eion prevailed. All available vehicles of
every description were pressed into ser
vice and every effort was made to save
household goods and stores; but so rapidly
did the flames spread that the people were
forced to flee for their lives and practic
ally nothing was saved. The streets be
came congested with teams and the ex
citement was increased by the frequent
explosions of giant powder stored in va
rious portions of the town. So far as
known, however, no loss of life resulted.
A conservative estimate places tlie total
loss at between $800,000 and $1,000,000, , and
the Insurance at $350,000.
Among the buildings destroyed are the
McCornick & Co. Bank; the large struc
ture of the Union Mercantile Company,
the Palmer House, the Catholic and Bap
tist churches and the telephone exchange.
The Mormon and Methodist churches
were not damaged and have been convert
ed into places of refuge for the most help
less and destitute of the women and chil
dren-
At 2:30 o'clock this afternoon a courier
rode into Fairfield, a station on the Tin
tic branch of the Oregon Short Line Rail
way, and telephoned that Mercur had
been wiped off the map so far as the busi
ness district is concerned. Not less than
forty or fifty stores have been destroyed,
and there is not a single store left in the
camp. The people are in a destitute con
dition. At least 1000 are without food and
shelter. Governor Wells and Mayor
Thompson of Salt Lake were appealed to
for immediate assistance.
SALT LAKE, Utah, June 25.â Mercur.
The great cyanide gold camp, and the sec

The origin of the fire remains a mystery
beyond the fact that it began with an ex
plosion of some kind about 9 o'clock this
morning in the upper story of the Preble
block, in which the Oquirrh Hotel and a
saloon were located. A short time after
the fire broke out the telephone exchange
was destroyed and all wire communica

i Although the "big four" has abandoned all
j attempts to bring Into use the new form of
charter, the combination has assumed the right
I to dictate in the matter of loading, and another
; fight may be precipitated between local char
i tÂ«rers and foreign owners. Although the Brit
; ish ships Kynance. Corunna and Queen Victoria
; and the German ship Alsterdam were chartered
j some time ago and under the old form, no steps
i have yet been taken toward loading any of
i them. The "Hie Four" insists that the San
1 Francisco Stevedoring Company, on account of
â¢ superior equipment, be engaged to attend to
j the loading. McAllister & Woodslde were se
; lected by the owners to do the stevedoring of
Â¦ the Queen Victoria and Menzies & Co. had
I been enKa^ed to do the work In the cases of
I the other ships. The owners say they will
I stand by their agreement with the smaller
; firms cf stevedores. The "Big Four" says the
> Kan Francisco Stevedoring. Company must do
! the work. Horns have been locked and no
i work will be done pntil the matter is settled.
Would Monopolize Stevedoring.
Xearly $500,000 was wagered in this port
on the.H. F. Glade's chance of arrival.
The fact that she was foul of bottom
when she left this port gave local specu
lators confidence in her safety. The feel
ing in England was otherwise and large
turns of British money were wagered on
the assumption of her loss. Had the
Glade arrived more than $500,000 would
have been divided in San Francisco. As
matters stand the division of the spoils
took place yesterday but In London and
Liverpool. . ,
The Glade has not been reported since
she sailed through the Golden Gate and
her fate may never be known.
THE German ship H. F. Glade,
which left here 249 days ago for
Queenstown with a cargo of
grain, was yesterday posted at
IJoyds as missing. She may still
be on the water: she may have gone ;
down early in the voyage. She is now
officially dead, all the financial specula- i
tlon as to her welfare has come to an
end, bets will be paid and collected and
the H. F. Glade will go down in marine
history as the most be-gambled risk upon
which reinsurance speculators ever turned
loose.
The case of Albert Hornleln of the Cafe
Royal charged with battery upon M. Fass
was dismissed by Judge Fritz yester
day. Fass claimed that after he lost his
meney at poker he asked Hornleln for
the loan of a dollar and Horniein threw
him out of the place. The Judge said
there was nothing to contradict the evi
dence of the defense that the place was
a club and that Horniein as a director
had the power to remove any one who
Â¦was obnoxious.

â¢ He hesitated as , to where he should
throw it but finally decided on first base.
Hanlon was not there and the throw went
wide, sending: Francks to third and Gor- j
ton to second. Schmidt was there at the j
correct moment and delivered a hot I
Oakland 2 to 1 when the Angels, on a
double from Householder's club, a. single
by Hanlon and a bad error by Francks,
tied the result in the ninth.
For the ensuing four innings the play
was the . best of the game. All kinds of
difficult chances were accepted. . Many
players I reached bases only to be lett
there when a hit would bring them in.
The . Oakland half of the thirteenth was
opened by Francks, who singled past
third. Gorton bunted and Jones picked
up the ball.
Los Angeles landed on Schmidt for
three singles in the fifth, netting one run.
Oakland took a hunch and tied the score
In their half of the same round. Three
more hits put another leader over the
rubber in the sixth. It began to look like
The Oakland, champs began to wallop
the sphere hard from the call of time un
til the game broke up. They secured six
hits before" a man crossed the rubber and
on one. occasion had the pillows all oc
cupied and no outs. They scored but a
lorely tally.
Schmidt and Jones opposed each other
on the slab. Both men were in magnifi
cent form. Jones was hit in a lively man
ner throughout the struggle, but by splen
did hea'dwork and fine fielding the Oak
lands were kept away from the plate
when it looked like an avalanche of runs
on several occasions. The honors, how
ever, go to Schmidt. He held down the
Southern swingers to six hits in the full
thirteen innings of scrappy play.
The Oakland desert upheld its reputa
tion as the regular oasis in the baseball
world for furnishing the hungry fans
with games which have a few additional
rounds tacked on. The nineteen-inning
affair, a few weeks ago was a wonder.
Yesterday thirteen fast explosions of
great baseball were rendered to a rag
time air. 'before Oakland took the crown
of glory by a score of 4 to 3.
On the night of the chase the riders
Â¦will be entertained at dinner and a ball.
The players In the tennis tournament will
be entertained at the same time.
Two silver cups are offered, one for the
first man to finish and one for the first
â¢woman. Should a woman lead out all
other competitors she will receive both
trophies.
The distance will be about ten miles
over the foothill country near San Ra
fael. Gaps will be cut in the fences, so
no jumping will be required, although rid
ers may resort to this if they so desire.

Club is in charge of the affair. A. C.
Blumenthal is secretary. He will receive
additional entries until a few days before
the event.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
YlS*^ The crutch is a poor substitute for legs, and affords a -very
I \y inconvenient and tiresome mode of locomotion â there is no more
llM| pathetic sight than a person slowly and painfully moving along the
VflT street supported by these artificial limbs.
Ay -When Rheumatism settles in the bones and muscles of the le^s
jm it is safe to predict that the victim will eventually become helpless
fl \\ and crutch-bound. The corrosive, irritating matter that is deposited â¢
V in the joints and muscles causes the most intense pain, the knees
' and ankles swell, and when the natural oils and fluids that lubricate
these parts are completely destroyed the joints become locked and
the muscles drawn and stiff, and crutches a necessity.
The acid poisons that produce rheumatic pains form in the blood, and are
distributed through the system, and lodged in the arms, shoulders', hands,
back and feet, or other parts of the body â resulting often in total disability!
A permanent cure of Rheumatism can be effected only by a complete cleans-:
ing of the blood, and no other remedy so surely accomplishes this as S. S. S.
It neutralizes the acid effects, purifies and invigorates the stagnant blo'odj
and the gritty particles are washed out or dislodged Â¦ ;â¢ _ _^ â¢ V" -
by the new rich bl odd, and relief comes to the fsÂ«^ CiT^ fc*^
pain-racked sufferer. S. S. S. leaves no morbid;
' irritating matter in the blood to reunite andproduce KÂ«Z)) KJu K^^J
another attack, but expels every atom of it from -^-^ %*-â¢
the system. S. S. S. is a purely vegetable remedy, ami does not impair
the digestion or general health like alkali or potash remedies. ,,

â¢According to the London Lancet the activity of
reformers is not due to moral causes, but to patho
logical conditions. The condition of mind that pro

vigilance or prudenca, nor deliberate or considerate
judgment; it is not even a" natural and rational anx
iety, though it may exhibit itself in the guise of any
one of these. It is mere fussiness." It is now up to
the reformers tp refute that diagnosis or take a pill.
The Supervisors' Committee on Charter
Amendments decided yesterday to recom
mend an amendment to the charter pro
viding for progress payments on public
contracts. The necessity of this amend
ment was advocated several months ago
by Commissioner Manson ot the Board of
Public Works. Under the present law
payment on a contract is not made .until
the work is completed and declared satis
factory. Small contractors are thus
barred in many instances from 'bidding,
which tends to lessen the competition. It
was stated that as contractors had to
wait so long for their money they includ
ed in their bids interest on their outlay,
which raised the price of the contracts.
The proposed amendment will authorize
the Supervisors to incorporate in the or
dinance empowering the Board of Works
to let a contract a clause providing for
partial payments to contractors while the
work is in progress. This will be done
under such regulations as may be deemed
necessary.
The committee also reported in favor
of a charter amendmeht whereby the
Board of Public Works tnay permit prop
erty owners to do their own sewer con
necting on unaccepted streets under offi
cial supervision, Instead of having it done
at their expense by the board, as at
present. Commissioner Casey opposed this
amendment on the ground that all sewer
woPk should be done by experts on a uni
form plan. Casey said that the many
leaks and collapses in sewers was due to
the fact that no general plan had been
followed and the work had been done in
a haphazard way.
The committee also adopted a number
of minor changes in the charter provi
sions relating to street improvements in
order to make, the charter conform more
closely to the general law. .
During the discussion Commissioner
Casey expressed himself as , strongly in
favor of the city establishing its own bitu
men plant for the purpose of doing the
repair work on bituminous streets
Casey says that the proposed innovation
would year by year become a matter of
more importance owing to the increased
amount of bituminous paving Casev
think3 the Board of Works should do ail
its own work "of; that character, because
the charter contemplates that it should

CITY CHARTER ,
IS IN NEED'OF
MORE AMENDING
Our sanitary science has conquered yellow-fever in
Cuba. and has before it a battle and a victory over
the cholera in the Philippines. If, however, the dis
ease should pass through a seaport to appear in! the
interior like the smallpox, and should locate on one
of the great watercourses, the consequences would be
.serious, because of the difficulty of fighting it under
such circumstances.
Cholera, unlike smallpox, is equally terrible in the
torrid and the temperate zones. If it were intro
duced and first appeared at " one of our seaports
energetic means would suppress it, as its last attack
on New York was turned by confining it to the ships
in the bay, the quarantine stations and detention
headquarters, so that not a single case appeared in
the city. But this was accomplished by vigorous
measures, including the complete cremation of all
victims of the disease. If the prejudices of the peo
ple did not prevent, cremation would be found the
most powerful agency in stamping out the disease in
the islands. -m'^'
It is known that we received from the Philippines
the most extensive and widely distributed invasion
of smallpox that the country has ever suffered. This
occurred notwithstanding the universality of vacci
nation and the superiority of modern sanitary science.
Smallpox is not feared in the islands and means for
its control are not used. It is one of those diseases
which tropical people do not fear. But their toler
ance of it became the means of exporting it to this
country, where in many States it has been for two
j'ears a. formidable problem' for local and Federal
sanitary officers.
The high death rate proves the very virulent char
acter of the disease. Among the victims are nearly
a hundred American soldiers. The epidemic is re
ported to be increasing and it has evidently got away
from the medical officers entirely and is beyond their
control. Our frequent communication with Manila
through the transport service makes necessary the
most rigid inspection and quarantine.
CHOLERA appeared in Manila in February
and has spread to the provinces. The medi
cal authorities were at first optimistic about
it and made reassuring reports, which have not been
justified by the subsequent spread of the epidemic.
At the last report there had been 8899 cases and 6676
deaths.
For the purpose of the Census Office the industry
was. divided into three branches, those of malt,
vinous and distilled liquors. The reports from all
branches of the industry show that 1,198,602,104 gal
lons of malt liquors, 103,330,423 gallons of distillates
and 23,425,567 gallons of wine were manufactured
during the census year ending May 31, 1900. This is
a total for all classes of i,325,353',O94 gallons, which
does not include quantities reported from small es
tablishments with a product less than '$500 each;
wine returned from farms and as a subsidiary pro
duct of distilleries; and spirits^ returned from
wineries, principally as a by-product.
In the manufacture of malt liquors New York
leads, the value pf her product of that kind in the
census year being $56,137,854. Pennsylvania was
second and Illinois third. In the production of dis
tilled liquors Illinois leads the Union with an out
put for the year of 32,508,435 gallons. Kentucky
ranked second and Indiana third. In the manufac
ture of vinous liquors California held theXfirst place
with a product valued at $3,937,871. New York was
second and Ohio third. . The manufacture of malt
and distilled liquors is fairly well distributed through
out the country, but the production of wine is largely
centered in the three States named. The combined
capital engaged in the industry in California, New
York and Ohio amounts to $8,437,783 out of a total
capital of $9,838,015 for the Union as a whole. \
The totals for all branches of the industry ' show
2835 establishments with a capital of $457,674,087, and
an- output for the census year valued at $340,615,466.
It is noted that the total valuation includes $96,708
443 as the value of distilled liquors, and that amount
includes an indeterminate amount of internal revenue
tax, which cannot be accurately computed because of
lack of uniformity. in reporting it. The report says:
"If such tax were-included in every instance the value
of the distillates reported would approximate $140
poo.ooaand the total value of all liquors would be in
creased from $340,615,466 to about $384,000,000. Re
turns from breweries uniformly included internal
revenue tax in. values of, products."
CENSUS BULLETIN No. 180, just issued,
gives statistics of the manufacture of alco
holic liquors in iooo, which was the first time
the industry was made the subject of a special in
quiry by the Census Office. The report is not ab
solutely accurate. It is stated the determination to
publish detailed statistics of the industry was reached
too late in the organization of the Census Office
work to permit the preparation of .'special schedules
for the collection of information, "and the general
schedule for manufactures had to be used in obtain
ing data. As a consequence there is lack of uniform
ity and completeness in the returns.

While the Appalachian forest is far away from us
California can watch with satisfaction the, action of
the Government in establishing and maintaining, it.
We also have a forestry problem to solve and will be
thankful for whatever help the National Govern
ment gives in such matters. Out of the experiments
to be made in the mountains of Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and
Alabama lessons will be derived by which we may
profit. The whole Union, in fact, may expect bene-^
fits from the measure, and future results may prove
it one of the most important acts of legislation under
taken by this Congress.
Senator Depew in speaking of the destruction of
the forest said: "It has turned these peaceful waters
into roaring floods, which have plowed deep and
destructive gullies through fertile fields and across
grassy plains. One freshet in the Catawba River last
spring, occasioned wholly by the deforesting of the
mountains, swept away a million and. a half dollars'
worth of farms, buildings and stock. The damage
done by- the freshet of last year alone in the large
territory fed by the streams and rivers which came
from these mountains was estimaied at over $18,000,
000. This destruction cannot be repeated many years
without turning into a desert the fairest portion of
our country."
The maintenance of the great forest means some
thing more than the preservation of the timber; .it
means the preservation also of the rich agricultural
lands that lie along the streams that flow down from
the mountains. The lands affected by those streams
on the Atlantic side of the mountains are 150 miles
wide, while on the Mississippi Valley side they are
much wider. The menace to them in the waste of the
forest lies in the fact that the mountain region has a
heavier rainfall than any other portion of the United
States except the North Pacific Coast. In the win
ter the rain falls in torrents, and where the forests
have been swept away the torrents rush down upon
the lowlands, flooding everything and sometimes ac
tually washing whole farms away.
In his speech on the bill Senator Depew said:
"The Appalachian forest preserve as proposed in the
pending measure is about 150 miles in length and of
varying breadth. It is from 4000 to 6000 feet above
the sea. It runs through - the States of Virginia,
West Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama and Tennessee. The slopes of these moun
tains are very steep, varying from 20 degrees at the
lowest to 40 degrees. The waters which flow from
the perpetual streams, fed by the perpetual springs,
run on the one side to the Atlantic and on the other
to the Gulf of Mexico. . .- .Â» The timber in this
forest is all hardwood, and is the largest body of
hardwood on the ; North' American continent It is
a museum of forest growth, embracing, on account
of its location, the wepods which can be grown in
temperate, semi-tropical and tropical countries.
There are 137 varieties, making this forest one of the
most interesting in the world. The deep soil has
been forming for a thousand years or more, and in
its interlacing of tree roots and humus, of grass and
leaves, there has beer, created an enormous sponge
for the absorption, retention and distribution of the
rainfall."
The forest is to be one of the most extensive in the
world, as it will include upward of 4,000,000 acres of
land. The country, however, is not rich nor well
adapted for agriculture as at present practiced in this
country, and the Government expects to obtain the
desired tract for $10,000,000. While comparatively
valueless for farming purposes the region Is of the
highest value for forestry and also as a point of con
servation of the water supply of a wide area x of
BY a substantial majority the Senate has passed
the bill providing for the establishment of a
vast forest reserve along the crests of the
Appalachian Mountains, in the Southern States. The
â¢ bill has been before Congress for a long time and has
received general approval. It has never been re
garded as a sectional measure, though the benefits
will accrue mainly to the South. One of its most
effective supporters is Senator Depew, whose recent
elaborate speech on the subject had doubtless much
to do in procuring its passage.
THE APPALACHIAN FORESTS.
So far the Directors have vindicated themselves. They do not intend that^for
gery of accounts shall go on> right under theft* noses and while Ihey are investigating
prison affairs. They stamp with disbelief the Governor's report that he found every
thing right and proper when he looked behifid the door, and they declare that "here
after" the criminal practices shall cease as a result of The Call's exposure of their ex
istence heretofore. .,. f . ; ; v . ; ;t .':/:?>Â¦/ N
When the Governor of California made his celebrated private inquiry and
emerged from behind locked doors to announce that he found prison affairs in fine condi
tion and our charges false, he was fortified by the affidavits of three persons in the prison,
the commissary and two others. These were to the effect that books, bills, records and
accounts were proper, and virgin, and the prison management up to missionary standard.
If these affidavits, procured by the Governor, are true, why do the Directors make their
significant "hereafter" order? The manipulated bills bear the countersign of. the com
missary, who makes affidavit that all was pure and proper. If so,. why not go on counter
signing forged, pasted, patched, substituted and sophisticated- bills for audit by the Direc
tors? It will be seen that the evidence procured by the Governor and treated by him as
exculpatory is not credited by the Directors, who evidently don't consider it worth the
paper upon which it was so hastily written that Sunday wh6n the notary was so sud
denly summoned to affix the jurat.
Not only have we the evidence of this unlawful work, but of the" delivery arid ship
ment of the results to various parties who were the beneficiaries, innocent or otherwise, of
these violations of the law.
The manufacture of furniture, articles of luxury, of harness and other things not
permitted by law was begun in San Quentin shortly after Warden- Aguirre took charge,
and was in full blast at the date of cur exposure. Then there- was a scuttle to cover. Ar
ticles already finished were hidden and those in process were abandoned. Why? If their
production were lawful and legitimate, or our exposure untrue, why stop work and hide
that already done?
There were two lines of dishonesty followed at San Quentin. In their pursuit they
were sometimes distinct and sometimes merged, one being necessary to the suc
cessful practice of the other. The board's "hereafter" order will suppress the
pursuit of one, and the board may. well strike practices in the other heretofore followed,
not only with a stern "hereafter" order but with some measure of punishment. â¢ The sec
ond line is the carrying on of illegal manufactures in the prison. Our proof of this is just
as clear and convincing as that of the manipulation of accounts, which is accepted. by the
Directors without further formality than its appearance in our columns.
The vast extent to which the system of false and forged' accounts has been carried
is not yet wholly known to the Directors. The means of completely informing them are
in hand and at' their disposal when they are ready for the evidence. They will then see
what a multitude of doorways to fraud and theft, heretofore swinging wide open, are
closed by their "hereafter" order. -
We. exposed the extensive use of forgery of bills and accounts by convicts; em
ployed for that purpose: All this part of the exposure is now admitted to be, true by
the Prison Directors, who last Saturday passed an order declaring that: "Hereafter
no claims will be allowed" that bear those stigmata of crooked work and are ob
viously blemished by crime. As this action of the Directors is in advance of the formal
investigation to begin onthe 26th, it is the affirmation by the board that our charges
were true, upon the evidence which we have already submitted. - :

The members of the Mercantile Library
Association met last night at 223 Sutter
street in answer to a call tp consider a
resolution requesting the board of trus
tees to rescind its action in offering the
property of the association on Golden
Gate and Van Ness avenues for sale for
$130,000. ' Georeg A. Newhall presided.
L. Dlamant offered .two resolutions, one
to the effect that the property be with
drawn from the market and the second
authorizing the board of trustees to enter
into negotiations with tho Mechanics' In
stitute with a view of consolidating both
Institutions.
After a long and spirited discussion, the
first resolution was lost and the second
was laid on the table. . .
In speaking to the resolutions Diatnant
urged that to sell the property at the
price advertised would .be a great sacri
fice. For tliat reason he strongly opposed
a sale which would only be Justified under
extreme conditions. 'He said that he had
always opposed consolidation, but the con
dition of affairs was such that he saw
no other way out of a difficulty that
threatened the sacrifice of the library.
Edward E.< Perley said that the pres
ent administration deserved great credit
for its. management of the library, and
also for the collection of several thousand
dollars in contributions and removing tha
library to the present accessible quartern.
For the lot on Van Ness avenue 540.000 had
been paid, he said and he had been told,
and now ho asked, what became Of the
other $30,000. as It was claimed that the
lot cost $70,000.
Charles Gutzkow denounced the state
ment relating to the price of the lot made
by Perley an being founded on hearsay.
Chairman Newhall then explained the
state of the library's affairs, which alone
necesitated the desire to sell the property.
The biggest offer for It was $115,000. which
the board, had rejected. The, Hibernla.
Bank, - he *said,' held a mortgage, on the
property and had threatened to foreclose.
Attorney Tobin had said that if they got
$125,000 they would be doing well. New
hall said that he considered that the prop
erty was worth $175,000. or even $200,000
no matter what Tobin might say concern
ing its value. .
On, motion of G. A.. Hubbell It was rd
solved that the board be empowered to

SAN FRANCISCO has completely
indorsed ,the opinion of London and
New York as to the great worm
of Arthur \V. Pinero's play, "The
Gay Lord Quex," at present being
presented by Henry Miller and Margaret
Anglin at the Columbia Theater. The
comedy has a run of four hundred Lon
don performances to its credit, and New
York was quite as enthusiastic over it.
This city has been offered a production
of the. piece on even a finer scale than
either of the others" and the result has
been .all that could be desired. Henry
Miller in .the title role and Margaret
Anglin as the manicurist, Sophy Full
garney.have the burden of the perform
ance on their shoulders and it is only
fair to say that they' have never done
more artistic or effective work in their
successful careers. The great third act
of the piece is not only a revelation in
dramatic construction but its Interest is
so well worked up that one's breath is
fairly taken away before the climax is
reached. The great duel of wits between
tho wily Lord and the brave manicurist
is without doubt the finest scene staged
here in any of the modern dramas. The
two players do not lose a point and the
audience shows its approval at the close
of the act by tendering no less than half
a dozen curtain-calls. The production is
to be on for another week, and the ad
vance sale for the second week is already
heavy.
The last days of the Neill season at
the California Theater are going very
successfully with "Nlobe" as the bill.
The farce Is really uncommonly humor
ous, and is very well done by Mr. Neill
and his associates, its ingenious com
plications being greeted nightly with a
continuous bubble of laughter.
Sunday night will mark the opening of
the Frederick Warde season, . when a
magnificent production of "Francesca da
Rimini" will be given. It promises to be
the best production this famous play has
had in San Francisco, and in many re
spects will excel the Skinner edition that
has been running in the East curing last
season.
"The Two Orphans" are finding many
friends at the Grand Opera-house these
days of the second week of the Morgan-
Fealy engagement. The ever popular ro
mance is acted and mounted -in a* much
more than commonly effective manner.
E. J- Morgan's Chevalier is a handsome
and manly figure, and the blind girl of
Miss Fealy is a touching and charming
picture. The rest of the cast is well
filled by the members of the house com
pany, v Â»A ...
"The Idol's Eye" at the Tivoli has been
most successfully revived. The opera
seems to have within It the germs of a
dramatic eternity, and is apparently as
popular now as at any period cf its long
career. All the Tivoli lights shine to ad-

"Fiddle Dee Dee" and the closing night
will be made a gala ohe as it marks tho
seven hundred and ninety-fifth time that
KoHj, Dill, Bernard and Miss Amber have
played their respective parts.
"Zaza" goes to an undiminished pop
ularity at the Alcazar Theater. The
crowded houses still continue, with the
enthusiasm that has been a feature of
the production since Its opening night.
The demand for seats has necessitated a
fourth wÂ«ek, and next Monday begins the
unusual fourth week of an Alcazar pro
duction. Miss Roberts is improving with
every performance, and the whole piece*"
goes with highly commendable smootH
ness.
Fred Hallen and Molly Fuller in "The
Sleep Walkers," Mr. and Mrs. Waterous,
baritone and soprano, Mabel Slsson and
May Stewart,, presenting "A Mysterious
Pill," and Dave Lewis, German comedi
an, this -week's newcomers, are enter
taining large audiences at the Orpheum.
Eleanor Falk and her chorus of ten girls,
Bedlni and Arthur, the comedy Jugglers,
Loris and Altlna, marvelous sharpshoot
ers, and Swan and Bambard, grotesque
acrobatic comedians, are all clever.
"The Road to Ruin," with its startling
situations and electrical scenic effects, is
packing the Central Theater this week.
Next Monday the Central company wll'
be seen in another Harvey melodrama,
"Sins of the Nieht."
This week's excellent programme at
thÂ«Â» Chutes includes the twin eistejs
Meredith, the two little Pucks. Webber
and Elliott, Kelly and Kent, Nellie Mont
gomery, Murphy and Slater and new
moving pictures. Hardy Downing loops
the loop on his bicycle and Mme. Schell
appears in her den of performing lions

the amateurs will conclude their perform
ance v/ith a new series of living fu

there were no bear sales In consequence. At

Tlie Stock Exchange committee confirms the
decision to close on Saturday. -
American stocks were hardly mentioned, but
they held firm above parities. Undoubtedly
they would have advanced but for the fear of
gold shipments from New York. Reading is

NEW YORK, June 25. â The dealings in
stocks Teal to near the low level of activity of
the year again to-day. The movement of prices
v.-as narrow and Irregular. For the principal
active stocks there was good support and tho
undertone of the market was rather lira, but
there was no disposition to buy in view of the
uncertainties hanslngr over the market. There
was a fairly general upward movement in the
early dealings, which probably came from bear
traders who sold short last evening on the ap
prehension that the King of England's illness
might terminate fatally over night. There was
buying here for London account, Â¦ prompted by
the same technical cause, which served to brinjj
to a halt the advance in sterling exchange.
The local money market ,was also distinctly
firmer in â¢.one and encouraeed bankers to sell
some sterling loan bills. Notwithstanding a
further recession in the prices of sterling at
Paris, there were no engagements of gold for
export. There was nothing in the news from
London as it reached Wall street to account
lor any strength in the stock market, as the
general fear was that the illness of the King
of England would terminate fatally. But tht?
sentimental effect of yesterday's suflden an
nouncement was somewhat disappointing. Nev
ertheless, there Is something to be apprehended
Irom the direct unancial losses involved in the
abortive preparations for the coronation. There
was nothing in the news of the day to account
for a riEe in i>riced oÂ£ stocks. The crop new.-*
was rather neutral. Traders who bought Read
ing professed some confidence that the strike
was to be settled, and they had news of eome
further returns to work by strikers, but there
was nothing like a general demand fpr the
coalers. Colorado Fuel was moved up 314
points on account of the session of the direc
tors to take action on the dividend, but the
gain was entirely wiped out without any news
reaching the public to account either for the
rise or lor the reaction. A late advance in rit.
Paul made the closing steady but very dull.
There was little doing in bonds and the mar
ket was irregular. Total sales (par value),
$2,015,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 â 5 p. m.
"Crop news is generally favorable. - Rain has
fallen in abundant quantities over large sec
tions of the country and the condition of corn j
1* excellent; ivheat is improving and cotton
holds its own wcl!. Thus far the crop situation
Is perfectly satisfactory, and the outlook is
for a good export demand, considering the less
favorable accounts from abroad. Should the
harvests realize present promise the somewhat
expected industrial reaction may be postponed
another year. The effect of short crops has 1
been felt in more ways than one during the
last year; but no~here more distinctly than in j
our export trade, which during the last twelve
months declined over $92,000,000, while our
trade balance was $167,800,000 less than a year
ago. Another season of drift in this direction
might bring very inconvenient consequences to
ibo foreign exchange market. Our bankers
have made large borrowings in Europe, and in
tl.Â« present stale of credit expansion in the
fnlted States Jt would suit u? much better to
ehip larger quantities of breadstuffs and cotton
tlan goid. Fortunately the indications at pres- j
ent are that relief will corne ;n this form. 1
"Tfce principal cloud in the business situation
1b the labor outlook. Costs of manufacturing
have already risen so high and selling is so
often done at a high firrure. threatening to less
en consumption, that intelligent business men
are exercising more caution In the making of
future contracts. Production is rapidly in
creasing owing to new competition, and there
is a general feeling abroad ! that high prices
fcave reached their limit, and that very soon
recessions will be necessary to keep capacity
well employed. This expectation inj-cts an ele
ment of doubt into the situation, -which acts as
a restraint upon general businsss. Perhaps this
is wholesome, for there are no signs of diminu
tion In the volume of business, and indications
are that sosie recessions in values would stim
ulate sales and give opportunity to a lot of
new enterprises held back by the high cost ct
establishing new plants. Needless to aay. with
such conditions confronting them, employers
cenerally do not see the way of increasing
trbges costs; hence the deterrent effect of pres
ent labor difficulties.
â¢â¢An Important element in the situation, en
tirely lost sight of for the moment, is the ces
eation of the Boer war. Its cost to Great
Britain during Its short duration of Ices than
three vears is now estimated at about $1.
20C,O00!oOU. while over 250,000 men were with
drawn from productive employments. No won
der English enterprise seemed to lag behind!
Now that these shackles have been removed and
the Britishers are 6purred by America's aston
ishing success in the industrial world, we may
expect to see a sharp revival of British enter
prise. We may feel this partly In keener com
petition, in which, however, the American is
well enough equipped to hold his own; we will
a'.to feel It in the renewed efforts tor world

come, therefore, from English competition they
Â¦will be vastly more than offset by the new
openings for capital and enterprise which Brit
ish activity trill develop. English savings lost
In wsr for the last three years will now seek
new investments; depression will disappear.
&r.d unless unforeseen disasters occur we may
reasonably expect to share the benefits of such
a recovery. The effect of African development
will be most noticeable in increased sold sup
plies No less an authority than John Hays
Hammond has estimated that within one year
after the resumption of mining operations in
the Wifwatersrand (which contributed 25 per
cÂ«nt of the world's product prior to the war)
the production of gold in that district tvould
rlF.e to nearly $100,000,000 per annum, and with
in three years it may reach $120,000,000. Such
heavy additions to the gold supplies are sure
10 ex"crt an important stimulus, that should not
fce lost sight of in estimates for the future.
They are certain to play an important part in
the " international exchanges before many
months.
"During the rart few days a bett-r invest
ment demand has be*n observed, due in part to
anticipation of the July disbursements. Last
year these reached the heavy total of $12.'..
000,000 and promise to exceed that figure this
year. The money market may be temporarily
disturbed by preparations for payment of these
sums but the outlook is for moderate rates un
til crop demands assert themselves. No de
cJdÂ»dly caey rates however, can be depended
upon until there has been a further contraction
In loans and a building up of reserves. The
outlook continues for a good trading market
with the tendency of prices of desirable rail
road shares generally upward. These are all
well held and with good earnings and various
deals in prospret it is easier to lift them than
to depress them. The industrials are compara

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, June 25.â Wheat showed strength
the first hour. , The opening was a trifle weak
on lower cables and a fairly good 'weather map.
There soon - arrived, however, a: batch -of bullish
reports of bad threshing returns, little ship
ments from Oklahoma, Indiana, Kansas and
Illinois, because of doubt as to , grading and
promises of more, wet â¢ weather." Elevators
bought for a short time and July wheat, which
opened unchanged to %c lower at 74%@74%c,
advanced to 74%c. Yesterday it ., "was known
that the, short interest was pretty, well elimin
ated. 'Such a condition favored a collapse,
owing to the absence of any interest to sup
port the market on dips. This break came to
day, when the elevator interests stopped sup
porting and liberal selling was indulged in.
Longs who had '- â¢'â¢tailed". Â¦ after Â¦ the ' big bulls
scurried to secure paper profits or, to prevent
actual loss. \ Both July and " September options
were sold freely. July dropped to 73%c. Some
support was put under the pit for a time and
a rally to 74c followed, but the close, was
weak..%c lower for July, at"73%c.
. Corn had a good jump at the opening, Induced
by higher cables and cold, wet weather in the
growing corn country. Â¦ Shorts covered and
the country bought liberally. July was pushed
up to the high price of 69c, which was reached
during last week's excitement. Shorts were
punished to some extent and then the market
was allowed to slip back. July closed %c up
at 68 %c. September closed a shade down at
bl%c.
Oats had a good advance early on buying
orders In the hands of all commission houses.
July closed firm, %c up, at 42V-C.
Â¦ It suited the packers again to-day to unload
some of their burden on the outsider. Hogs,
although touching $7 95, were generally
weaker. This caused general liquidation most
of the day. * July pork closed 17V-C lower, lard
10c lower and ribs (September) 15@17%c down.

Wheat in the interior of the State. While the
spot quotation for shipping in this market is
given at $1 12 % by both shippers and sellers,
it is common talk on- the Produce Exchange
that much higher prices are being paid by spec
ulators and other buyers in the- country. . Sev
eral days ago sales for this outside account at
$115 were reported, and yesterday a sale as
high as $1 20, Port Costa, was confirmed. Of
course this figure is away above the parity of
the foreign market, and the only explanation is
that there is keen competition for Wheat, and
as the farmers are generally holding back the
buyers are compelled to pay a stiff advance to
get the groods, and take their chancea about
getting out even later on.
Spot Wheatâ Shipping. $1 12%; milling, $1 15

Â¦A writ of attachment was Issued yes
terday by Superior Judge Murasky

moneys now in his possession belonging
to Black. The attachment is in connec
tion with a suit filed by the Security Trust
Company against Black for the recovery
of $500 alleged to have been paid on a
fraudulent draft.
Cashier Scott swore to another ' com
plaint before the Judge yesterday charg
ing Black with making and passing a fic
titious check for $800 on June 12 on the
Citizens' Bank of Santa Clara. The check
was made payable to Black and signed
"G. A. Groves." The warrant was served
by Detective McMahon upon Black In the
City Prison.
Chief Wittman was notified yesterday
that an officer had left Springfield, Mass.,
with the necessary papers for Black's ex
tradition and everything will be done to
hold Black till the officer arrives. \ Black
is accused of swindling a bank ln<Spring
iield out of $385 by means of a worthless
draft.
J. B. Black, the man with many aliases,
appeared before Judge Conlan yesterday
on two charges of making and passing
fictitious checks. Assistant District At

ness be dismissed and It was so ordered.
Weller then asked that the case in which
Colonel Andrews of the Diamond Palace

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Thomas Nunan, a newspaper reporter,
was closeted with the jurors for. a brief
period this morning, j He was called to
establish the authenticity of several inter
views with Dalton that appeared in hi3
paper. L. G. Jordan, bookkeeper for the
inquirer, was recalled to mi In some gaps
in his previous testimony.
Supervisors Mitchell and Church, who
were on the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors when Dalton's bills
were passed, were called to explain how
It was that the county paid for something
it never got. They are said to have ex
p ? Jne< L that the y took for granted that
all of Dalton's indorsements as to the re
ceipt of goods were correct.
Editor Daniels and Assessor Dalton
were recalled for the third or fourth time
?l, tne ir own request. T. M. Robinson,
Chief Deputy. Assessor,. was the last wit
ness of the day. An adjournment was
then taken until to-morrow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 23.
The Grand Jury has got down to the
bottom facts in its investigation of the
missing book scandal that Is shaking up
politicians and the Courthouse and the
wind-up and indictments are expected to
come to-morrow. The last witness, with
the exception of Frank J. Moffltt, was
called to-day and his testimony is ex
pected to be short .
It was all Abraham Lincoln could do. Inci
dentally he has done all. Taft has done It.
Wood has done It. These three men have ren
dered that seirice. I can do nothing for them.
I can show my appreciation of them In no way
nave the wholly insufficient one of standing up
for them and for their works, and that I will
do.
The President paid a glowing compli
ment to Secretary Root, saying of the
three men that they had done the best
that,.circumstances permitted. Said he in
conclusion:
â¢ Â¦H-l-I-l-l-l-H-H-l-I-I-'H-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-O
the standard of political and social life In
that island; to clean it physically and morally;
to make Justice even and fair in it; to found
a school system that should be akin to our
own; to teach the people after four centuries
of misrule that there were such things ps
governmental righteousness and honesty and
fair play for all men on their merits as men.
He did all that. He Is a man of slender
means. He did it on his pay as an army offi
cer and as governor of the Island. Sixty mii
lionÂ« of dollars passed through his hands, and
he came out having to draw on his slender
capital 1p order that he might come out even
when ht- left the island. Credit to him? Yea,
in. a way. In another, no particular credit,
because he was built so that he could do noth
ing olse.. He came out having done that and
as having devoted himself to the good of the
Cuban people in all their relations as man
could. He has come back here and has been
attacked, forsooth, by people who are not mere
ly unworthy of having their names coupled
with his, but rrho are incapable of understand
ing the motive* that have spurred him on to
bring hener to this republic.
And Taft, Judge Taft, Governor Taft, who
has been the head of the Philippine Commis
sion, and who has gone back there. Taft, the
most brilliant graduate of his year at Yale,
the youngest Yale man upon whom that insti
tution ever ' conferred the degree of LL.D., a
man who having won high positions at the
'bar and then served as solicitor general, with
all his tastes impelling him to a judicial ca
reer, and who was appointed to the United
States bench and was asked to give up . the
position to go to the other side of the world
to take ud an infinitely difficult and infinitely
dangerous problem, and to do his best to move
It He has done his' best. He came back here
the other day. The man has always had the
honorable ambition to get upon the Supreme
Court, and he knew that I had always hoped
he would be put upon the Supreme Court, and
when there was a question of a vacancy aris
ing I said to him. "Governor. I think I ought
to tell you that if a vacancy comes In the Su
preme Court, while It would give you an op
portunity to be put In the position you would
like to have, I think I ought to tell you that
If such a vacancy should occur I do not see
how I could possibly give It to you, for I need
you where you are."
He said to me, "Mr. President, it has always
been my dream to be In the Supreme Court,
but If you should offer me a Justiceship now
and at the same time Congress should take
off entirely my Balary as Governor. I should
go straight back to the Philippines, neverthe
less, for those people need me, and expect me
back, and believe I won't desert them." He
has gone back, gone as a strong friend among
weaker friends, to help them upward along
the stony and difficult path of self-government.
To do his part, and as a great part. In mak
ing the American name a symbol of honor and
good faith in the Philippines: to govern with
Justice and with that firmness, that absence
of â¢ weakness, which Is only another side of
Justice. He has gone back to do all of that
because It Is his duty and he sees It. We
ere to be congratulated, we Americans that
we have a fellow American like Taft.
The Vincent family lived In perfect har
mony at 835% Seventh street until "Gay
Paree" came to town. The husband took
his wife and baby to see it. He struck up
an acquaintance with the muscle dancer
and was soon Infatuated with her painted
charms. He went again and again and
finally Informed his wife of his attach
ment. She protested in vain.
When last Saturday arrived Vincent
drew half a month's pay from the rail
road company and resigned his position.
Then he went home and told his wife
that he was going to Reno with the "Gay
Paree" company. He was a passenger on
the train with his charmer when it pulled
out of the depot Sunday morning.
A "Gay Paree" girl has broken up the
once nappy family of William Vincent,
until three days ago an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company. The show left
town the night the Elks' Carnival closed
and Vincent went with the lady who does
the muscle dance. His wife is distracted
over his conduct and his infant child crys
for a father.

Fain and Markley dissolved partnership
a vear ago, Markley retaining the store
building and business. Recently Fain
sold the land on which the store stands
to another resident of Champoeg arid
Markley was last night given notice to
move the building off the land within six
months. This morning, as Fain came out
of his house at the rear of the store and
passed the store, he was shot.
Neighbors, hearing the report, rushed to
his aid in time to hear the statement of
the dying man. He accused Markley,
who, he said, had opened the back door
of the store, and, exclaiming, "We will
now have a settlement,, and you'll take
your medicine," fired at close range. *
Fain died two hours later. His weapon
was a shotgun and a charge of buckshot
had entered Fain's left Bide, passing
through the abdominal wall.
Markley is wealthy and an old settler.
Fain also was well to do. Both men were
bachelors. Fain has two sisters in Mis
souri and a father In Los Angeles.
SAL.EM, Or., June 25.â Champoeg, an
historic town in this county, was this
morning the scene of a sensational mur
der. John D. Fain, for many years a
business man of Champoeg, was shot in
the front of his house at 5 o'clock. His
former partner, J. F. MarKiey, is held in
the County Jail, charged with the crime.
Should it appear from the evidence that
Yang smuggled any opium Into Hawaiian
territory, the United States Government
will request the Chinese Government to
recall Agent , Yang as an exceedingly un
pleaslng person, in the diplomatic sense.
The case of Yang- Tsang Cheng, con
sular agent for the Chinese Empire at
the port of Honolulu, has been brought
to the attention of the Secretary of the
Treasury, and Customs Collector Strat
ton has been requested by the depart
ment to make an investigation and to
submit to the authorities at Washington
his report." " .---; -. .> : â¢* '-Â¦
It was a law of the Hawaiian kingdom
,in the days of jovial King Kalakaua that
no opium for smoking purposes should be
allowed to be introduced Into the islands.
The law was continued in force when the
islands were annexed to thd United
States and still continues. Hence the
profit in smuggling the drug Into the isl
and Is very large, and because of the in
ducements offered the Treasury Depart
ment has insisted "that the local law
should be enforced rigidly. Several weeks
ago Tang Tsang Cheng, who had
been recently appointed by the- Chinese
Government, arrived at Honolulu to as
sume his duties as consular agent. He
brought with him twenty-two trunks
supposed and represented to contain his
personal baggage. These trunks were al
lowed by the customs officials to be land
ed without being examined for dutiable
or prohibited goods, the exemption being
a matter of courtesy in the case of em
bassadors and other diplomats. Soon af
ter Yang's arrival it was discovered that
large quantities of smoking opium were
being sold at prices considerably below
the ruling fate,- and an investigation
brought to light facts tending to show
that the opium had been smuggled by
Consular Agent Yang.
The Treasury Department notified E.
R. Stackable, collector of the port cf
Honolulu, that consular agents are not
ranked as diplomats and that Yang was
not entitled to the privilege of having his
baggage landed without examination.
Collector Stackable has replied that he
Â¦was very new to his duties when Agent
Yang arrived,*but that he had requested
the United States quarantine officer to
be very careful when fumigating the
trunks, to see that they did not contain
opium.
General Wood some years ago went to Cuba,
lie has served there ever since, haM rendered
service to that co-untry of that kind which
if performed 3000 years ago would have made
him a hero mixed up with the eun god tn
various ways. A man who devoted his. whole
life to tliÂ«>se fonr years and thought of nothing
else: did nothing else save to try to bring up
No man has a right to arrogate to himself
one psrticle of superiority bec&uee he lias had
a college education, but he Is bound. If he is
In truth a. man. to feel that the fact of his
having had a college education imposes upon
him a heavy burden of responsibility; that it
makes it doubly incumbent on him to do well
and nobly in his life, private and public. I
want to speak of three men who during the
last three or four years nave met with that
requirement â of a graduate of Hamilton Col
leg*, Elihu Root; a graduate of Tale, Gover
nor Taft, and of a fellow Harvard man â Gen
eral Wood. Men who did things, who did not
say how should they do them, but did them
themselves; men who have met that greatest
of our nf*Â£e â the need for the service that
cannot be bought, the need for the service that
can only be rendered by the man willing to
forego the material advantages, for It has
got to be riven at the man's own material cost.
When in Knjrland they get a man to do what
Lord Crtrner did in Egypt; when a man re
turns as Lord Kitchener will return from South
Africa, thev give him a peerage and a gteat
sum of money. He receives large and tangible
reward. End our Cromere, our men- of that
stamp, come back to the country, and if they
are fortunate they go back to private life with
the privilege of taking up what they can find
with the strings loose when they surrendered
their old connections, and if they are unfor
tunate they are accused of maladversion in
office â not an accusation that hurts them, but
an accusation that brands with infamy any
man who makes it, and that reflects but ill
on the country in which It is made.
After euloglnzlng Senators Hoar and
Lodge and Secretary Hay, Mr. Roosevelt
said:
Let me speak for all Americans to-day when
I say that we watch with the deepest concern
and sympathy the sick-bed of the English
King and that all Americans In tendering
their hearty sympathy to the people of Great
Britain now remember only the outburst of
general grlel with which England laÂ«t fall
greeted the calamity that befell us in the

The troubles in the Vannatta household
are due to Mi3s Edith Plerson, Mrs. Van
natta's sister, for whom Vannatta dis
played an affection hot in keeping with
his relation of brother-in-law. Mrs. Van
natta objected strenuously to the change
in affections, but to no avail. She even
begged Miss Pierson to go home to her
mother anoVleave her in the enjoyment of
\ annatta's "waning love and affection, but
received little satisfaction. Tbe crisis
was reached when Vannatta, under pre
text of making a business trip to Santa
Cruz, went away for a few days, taking
Miss Pierson with him. Prior to that trip
Mrs. Vannatta was convinced that her
husband thought more of his sister-in
law than he did- of his wife. She learned
of several very suspicious moves on the
part of her husband and her sister from
Mrs. Mary McDevitt and Mrs. E. H.
Laston, who conduct the house where
Vannatta lives. These ladies corroborat
ed Mrs. Vannatta's testimony yesterday.
Vannatta conducted a private detective
agency at 4024 Twenty-third street. He
was formerly superintendent of the San
i rancisco branch of the Pinkerton Detec
tive Agency and resigned his post "by
request." The amours of Vannatta will
cost him a pretty penny besides the los*
of his wife. He must pay her $130 during
the next two months, $50 a month ali
mony thereafter, and must also pay $100
counsel fees and $22 50 costs of suit. Mrs.
Vannatta also gets the household furni
ture. Â¦
Blanche Vannatta, with the assistance
of two lady friends, convinced Judge Mu
rasky yesterday that Charles E. Vannat
ta, her husband, was not a model spouse,
and he accordingly granted her a divorce.
She brought suit on the grounds of cruel
ty and infidelity. Vannatta did not de
fend the^action.

"The study of law, which at first was
a great pleasure, became a burden, and a
first class physician told me that I never
would be able to serve a full term in fa

If I wanted to enjoy life. When upon
the point of doing so I wm talking one
day with one of the firm, who advised
me to make a. change in food and recom-
mended very highly your Grape-Nuts,
saying I could get a package at any gro-
cery and make the test.
"The advice impressed me so strongly
that I at once purchased and Â£egan us-
ing Grape-Nuts. I found that after us-
ing this food I was not troubled with the
lingering pain In my stomach that had
been with me for some time; instead I
was perfectly comfortable, and I had not
eaten the food for more than four or five
days when I began to notice a change.
My head became clear again and I be-
gan to enjoy my studies as well as I did
on the start, and could accomplish more
in one week from that time, on than I
had in a whole month prior to that time.
"My blood, which had naturally become
bad, presently improved; my digestion
also was better. The blotches on my face
began to disappear and I felt better in
every way.

A Miraculous
Feat.
"It seemed that nothing: short
of a miracle could save my little
daughter from an untimely
death," says City Marshall A.
H. Malcolm, of Cherokee.Kan.
" When two years old she was
taken with stomach and bowel
trouble and despite the efforts
of the best physicians we could
procure, she grew gradually
worse and was pronounced in Â»
curable. A friend advised
Mills' Nervine
and after giving it % few days
she began to improve and final-
ly fully recovered. She is now
past five years of age and the
very picture of health."

the r.se of medicine; there is.no home so
sad and dreary, no heart so forsaken and
lonely, no life so hard and blighted that can-

matter what trouble you may have, call and
he wIH help you or charge nothing for his
services; "palmistry taught, mediumistic
persons developed"; learn a profession that

Denver Ed Martin defeated Sandy Fer
guson of Boston in five rounds to-night
at the National Sporting Club. The bout
was hot, exciting and clever. When hard
pressed Ferguson became reckless, ' and
early in the fifth round he was brought
down with a right hook- on the point of
the jaw. . He was floored three times
more and was then so weak as to justify
the referee in stopping the bout and de
ciding in Martin's favor.
At me opening of rotund 11 both were
full of tight and the exchanges were rapid
and vicious, SharKey trying to get "in a
knockout. He was sent down repeatedly,
but he wanted a lot of punching to tinish
.liim. Ruhlin was too tired to do it. Time
aftejr time the latter got in his right on
Sharkey's body and his left on his jaw,
but without attaining the desired end.
Sharkey rolled all over the ring and was
down when the bell sounded and Ruhlin's
seconds claimed the fight. The referee
declined to allow their claim, explaining
that Sharkey 'was only knocked down
eight seconds before the end of the round.
'Sharkey's second, however, threw up the
sponge, and ' Ruhlin was declared the
winner. â¢ 'â¢
In the sixtn round Sharkey looked re
freshed. Kunlin's strengtn maae.it diffi
cult lor SharKey to get ciose to his oppo
nent. He relied upon swinging his iefti
which he got home, shaking rtuhlln up.
The tentn round started last and furi
ous, Sharkey putting a splendid right on
the mark, jtiuhlin made the most of the
round, but- Bharliey was not to be denied
and iought on gamely, while Kuhiin wise
ly kept out of danger.
Adopting forcing tactics, tinarkey held
his own in the nrst tnree -rounds, al
tuougn ftunlih always managed 10 escape
Janariiey's " ligntninjj lert wncnever tnere
was any force in iu in the iourtn' round
bnaritey was cautioned a. second time lor
holuinsj. At the opening or tne nf tn round
riuttlin sent nis rignt and left to Simr
key's jaw ana nee^ ana the latter was
cautionea lor hitting low. Kunlin was
goou on his feet anu maintained a splen
uid deiense, wnile SharKey was the re
ceiver general. . . - .
' LONDON, June 25.-Gus Ruhlin defeat
ed Tom Sharkey in the eleventh round
before the National Sporting Club to
night. The fight was held in connection
with the coronation sporting week events.
Sharkey started a slight favorite at 22
to 20. Both fighters were in the acme of
condition. Sharkey' s seconds were Tommy
Ryan, Bob Shancey and Spike Sullivan,
while Ruhlin was seconded by bis broth
er, Billy Madden and Jem Mace. . ;

George H. Maxwell and R. M. F. Soto
filed a similar notice on the ground that
the defendant was not in default, that the
judgment was a surprise to the attorneys
and that it occurred through the excus
able neglect of said attorneys.
The original suit was brought to recover
on the value of bonds alleged to have
been contracted to the plaintiff for work
done for the defendant.
W. H. Chamberlain, Frank Freeman,
Charles. L.Donohoe and William Cannon,
attorneys for the defendants in the two
cases of the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific
Company vs. the Central Irrigation Dis

cuit Court yesterday that on July
SO at 11 a. m. they would move
for an order setting aside the
default and judgment entered on April
1 against the defendants for $75,000. The
motion will be based on the ground, say
the attorneys, that the judgment and de
fault were entered through inadvertance,
surprise and excusable neglect of the de
fendant and through, the intentional mis
conduct and neglect of R. M. F. Soto. at
torney for the. defendant in said action.
The same attorneys filed a similar notice
in a case between the fame litigants, in
Â¦which the default judgment was for S38.

was ever issued or served in the case and
that neither R. M. F. Soto nor any other

Rogers said that being pressed for money
he had written to Simpson and asked his
permission , before - taking the coin. Re
ceiving no answer, .Rogers said that he
had taken it for granted that everything
was all right. Simpson says he never re
ceived the latter. .
Simpson, when this information was
given him, agreed, he says, to wipe
Rogers' account from the firm's books
and told the cashier to make a new start
in life. He gave his foregiveness freely,
he says, and thought the incident had
passed. He said last night:
"It is inconceivable . to me how this
thing should have. occurred. Pride and an
oversensitive nature could alone have
brought us- all such sorrow. He owed a
little money, but the debta, with the ex
ception of the one owed to the firm, had
nearly all been liquidated.

"Had I but known his predicament and
how seriously he took the matter I would
have furnished him ten times, yes, one

devoted to his wife and was a model man.
I would have assisted him. as I would
have assisted a son."
At noon yesterday Rogers left the firm's
office at 14 Spear street and went to the
lumber yard at the foot of Powell street.*
He asked for the keys to the stable, say
ing that he wished to see a litter of pups
that was owned by the watchman. When
he did not reappear for some time a clerk
was -sent in search of him and he was
found lifeless on some sails in the stable,
a. bullet through his head and his stiff
hand still clutching the instrument of
death. On his person was found the fol
lowing note:

that I wrote the letter. Be good and take care

The Fourth of July committee has not
yet succeeded in removing the obstacles
which stand in the way of a street parade
on the morning of the Fourth. A meeting
of the board of directors of the Musicians'
Union' was' to have been held yesterday
for the purpose of determining whether
or not the union bands would be allowed
to parade with the National Guard bands,
which are non-union. The meeting, how
ever, was postponed until 1 o'clock this
afternoon. Until this meeting is held and
the musicians give their decision, the
Fourth of July committee will be serious
ly handicapped in making arrangements.
The action of -the committee in voting
not to pay the National Guard bands for
their services during the parade has
proved a sore disappointment to the
guardsmen. It is possible that the militia
may refuse to join in the regular parade.
Although the law requires the National
Guard to parade on the Fourth of. July
and en Decoration day, it does not pre
scribe where or under what conditions the
parade shall be held.
Major General John H. Dickinson stated
yesterday that the National Guard could
parade in its armories or in the streets
adjacent to its armories if it so desired.
He said: "It has been the custom for a
number of years for the Fourth of July
committee to pay the National Guard
bands for playing on the Fourth and we
certainly see' no reason why they should
not.be compensated for their services this
year. According to the orders from head
quarters. Brigadier General R. H. War
field is the one who has the right to de
cide where and with whom the National
Guard of this city shall parade."
Grand Marshal Dr. Ira Barker Dalzlel
spent the greater part of yesterday select
ing his aids and trying to instill some
semblance of order Into the chaotic con
dition of affairs. Aside from the parade,
all the features of the celebration are pro
gressing nicely. The people will at least
be given an opportunity to witness a dis
play of fireworks and listen to the orator
deliver a good, old-time Fourth of July
speech.

William F. Rogers, cashier of the Simp
son Lumber Company, committed suicide
yesterday afternoon by shopting himself
through the hea3. The tragedy occurred
at the company's yard, at the foot of
Powell street. Rogers' pride was his
downfall. Ho, owed money and because
he could not see his way clear to liqui
date his debts he brushed worry aside
with a, bullet. To the other employes of
the lumber iirm Rogers gave no Intima
tion of tho humiliation to which he
deemed he had been subjected. For those
who saw him last he had only a. smile.
A letter left by the dead man Is at. va
riance with statements made by his wife's
uncle. This letter carries an intimation
of an upbraiding. The. undo says there
was no unpleasantness and that any nec
essary amount of money was ready to
Insure Rogers' happiness of mind.
Rogers, who was 36 years of age, .was
married a year ago to Miss Bertha Simp
son, a niece of Asa M. Simpson, presi
dent of the Simpson Lumber Company,
and daughter of A. W. Simpson of Stock
ton. Since then he had served in the ca
pacity of cashier for the firm at a salary
of $150 per month. The couple moved to
2226 California street, and Rogers spent
considerable money in fitting up their
home. He ran into debt and soon col
lectors presented him with bills that he
could not pay.
MAKES USE OF $1500.
...J^ 11611 P res sed for money, Rogers took
?j500 from the treasury of the firm and
settled the greater portion of his obliga
tions. When the money was drawn Asa
Simpson was in the State of Washington
and was not aware of the matter. As
soon as he returned he questioned Rogers
and gently chlded him for having appro
priated the firm's money to his own use.
pany and the Cosmos Exploration Com
pany of California to compel the Secre
tary of the' Interior to issue certain
patents to valuable oil lands in Kern
County, California, The decision of Jus
tice Clabaugh was preliminary to a final
decision and affects v primarily demurrers
filed to the answer of Secretary Hitch
cock to the original bill. The decision di
'rectly disposes of the mandamus pro
ceedings, however, and the only- action
that remains to be taken simply involves
signing of the decree.
The General Land Office has refused to
grant patents to the land in question on
the ground that formal and legal steps' to
acquire possession of new land and re
linquish old had not been compiled with.
The petition was made to the District Su
preme Court by the companies interested
to compel â¢ the-; Secretary of; the' Interior
to issue patents, and in an answer filed
shortly thereafter r the Government offi
cials stated that" actions of an executive
official could be controlled by mandamus
proceedings only in two classes of cases
âwhen he refuses to act and when his
action is a simple, direct ministerial duty,
involving the exercise of no judgment or
decision. - - ' ' â¢
In his decision Justice Clabaugh held
that the only question at issue was
whether the decision of the Secretary of
the Interior was purely ministerial in
character or required exercise of a judi
cial discretion. < Â¦ -
The statute that governs these cases is
susceptible to - only two constructions,
the court held, and a well-known appel
late court had divided on that point. The
moment Secretary Hitchcock was called
upon to decide whether or not the titles
to the land were good his action passed
beyond the category of a ministerial act.
The decision upholds . the contention of
the Government that the Land Depart
ment of the office of Secretary of the In
terior is a special tribunal, having judi
cial functions and ' jurisdiction over all
proceedings for acquisition of public
lands.- 'Â¦Â¦--.

ductive interests were therefore at stake.
Tho dispatch bringing the first Informa
tion came from Senator Bard's secretary.
The scrippers have made a long fight
against the mineral land claimants in the
matter of taking up public lands as placer
claims. In the rirst place, mineral claim
ants and scrippers, or lieu land claimants,
alike make haste to secure that part of
tho public domain that seemed to bo like
ly to yield petroleum when*, development
work was performed. The scrippers took
up the lands with forestry reserve scrip.
The mineral locaters availed themselves
of the placer location law on the statute
books. Litigation came In with a rush.
At first it was decided by a Federal
Judge that land could not be held - aa
placer locations unless the mineral char
acter of the land was actually demon
strated. The scrippers were in high glee
then. They made more locations in dis
tricts where oil was being actually pro
duced, but on tracts where the oil had not
been actually found, ' but where it was
supposed to be by all who had studied
geological formations. The first decision
of the Federal court was reversed by the
same Judge after a while. Tho United
States Court of Appeals confirmed the
later decision. Then an appeal was taken
to the ' Supreme Court of the United
States.
The Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of the General Land Office,
the latter being Binger Hermann then,'
had their attention called to what was
going on in California. The disputed
lands were withdrawn from, entry until
an investigation could be held. The sub
sequent proceedings, insomuch as they re
lated to the acts of the Department of
the Interior, were entirely satisfactory to
the oil men, but not to the scrippers. The
latter brought a mandamus suit to com
pel the Secretary of the Interior to issue
patents to lands claimed by them. This
was the phase of litigation that came to
an issue favorable to the. oilmen yester
day through the court of the District of
Columbia.
NEW PEHIL LOOMS UP.
But while the oil land owners who se
cured their property as through placer lo
cations were happy on this one. account,
they were anxious about and counseled all
day long in reference to another move that
the scrippers have been engaged in mak
ing at the national capital In the last few
days. A bill fathered by Congressman
Dick went through tne House of Repre
sentatives on June 17 providing for appeal
from the decisions of the Secretary of the
Interior to the Supreme Court of the
United States in contested land cases.
This has in it the possibility, at nrst not
perceived here, '. of bringing about rever
sals of the decisions of the Secretary of
the Interior in all mineral land cases,
which includes the oil lands, petroleum
being a mineral oil. Jefferson Chandler
and other attorneys identified with the
cause of the scrippers appeared before the
sub-committee of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to urge a favorable report that
the Senate might take concurrent action
with the House of Representatives.
It was here that the work of the oil
men in California has told in some de
gree. They have ascertained the danger
in the measure that was* advocated by
the lawyers for the scrippers and have
taken means to Inform the California Sen
ators concerning the significance of the
Dick bill. Both Senators have appeared
before the sub-committee and have ob
jected to a favorable reports Yesterday
afternoon information was received from
Washington that led the oil men to be
lieve that the bill has no chance to pass
the Senate during the present session of
Congress.
Senator Perkins telegraphed to the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners' Association that
he had assurances from the members of
the Judiciary Committee that the scrip
pers' bill will not be reported to the Sen
ate this session. This was in response
to a telegram sent by Secretary Deane
of the Petroleum Miners* Association.
KEEP WIRES HOT.
A flood of communications has gone to
Washington. -President Newhall of the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce ad
dressed the California Senators in a tele
gram in which he asserted that the
Chamber of Commerce believes that the
bill giving Federal Jurisdiction to review
decisions of the Secretary of the Interior
in scripper contests establishes an unwise
precedent in taking from the department
power which it has heretofore possessed.
Collector of the Port Stratton sent ths
following to Senator Perkins:
The bill Introduced by Congressman Dick,
giving Jurisdiction to the United States Su
preme Court from decisions of the Secretary
of the Interior In oil lands, will disastrously
affect petroleum miners of this State. The oil
men are thoroughly alarmed, and desire either
the defeat or postponement of the measure
until tney can be heard. . I am conversant with
all the facts and would earnestly invite your
co-operation. Will you further kindly tele
graph me the status of the matter and in what
direction efforts may be directed? :
Senator Perkins answered Collector
Stratton that the bill, having already
passed the House, was before the sub-
Judiciary Committee, of which Senator
McComas is chairman, and that McComas
looks at the measure with favor.
The California Miners' Association tele
graphed to Senators Bard and Perkins
that the bill introduced by Dick is mani
festly contrary to the established prac
tice of the Government and la held here
to be solely in the interest of an organ
ized scheme to acquire mineral lands un
der the lieu land law passed for an en
tirely different purpose. Also it was set
forth that nothing more disastrous- could
happen to the interests of mining than
the- passage of the Dick bill, and it was
urged that nothing should be left undone
to defeat the measure.
The California Petroleum Miners' As.
Eociatlon sent the following telegram,
which was signed by President de Young
and Secretary Deane, to Senator Perkins:
Scrippers' bill that has passed the House and
now Is by the Senate referred to the Judiciary
Committee should be defeated. The people here
are much excited and depend on* you. Â¦
There Is evidently a great deal of work
for the oil men to do. They are making
plans to have the entire matter brought
in a. full and satisfactory way to the
Senate committee that Â¦ has the Dick bill
before It.
