PLANS OF PROPOSED BUREAU.
James Horsburgh Jr. presented a series
of resolutions which outlined the plans
of the bureau It is proposed to form. Ha
said that the Chamber of Commerce cf
San Francisco was disposed to co-operate
with the interior counties In the work arii
he puggested that his resolutions be re
ferred to that body for action. The reso
lutions began as follows: â¢
"Whereas, The prosperity of the city of San
Francisco as the metropolis of the Pacific
Coast 'and the prosperity of tributary sections
are Interdependent and the prosperity of the
country Immediately adjacent to San Fran,c'.3co,
comprising the three sections known as the
Sacramento Valley, the San Joaquin Valley and
the central ana coast line counties, is particu
larly of vital importance to San Francisco,

that must come to San Francisco through such
development that wiÂ» urge upon the people
of San Francisco the vigorous co-operation.
financially and otherwise, of Its citizens with
these associations and others that may here
after be formed.
In furtherance of this co-operation the
resolutions call for the organization of
a Directors' Association, to consist of
three members from each of the out.iido
associations referred to and a number
from the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce equal to the total of such outside
representation, these directors to . bo
chosen as. the different bodies elect and
to constitute the active working body.
It is also provided that the chairman of
will be for the best Interests of all con
cerned.
Green admitted the truth of much that
was said by Mills, but he said It should
not be forgotten that the people of San
Francisco and Oakland owned one-thinl
of the realty In the Sacramento Valley
and what they did not own they had
mortgages on. Mills made no denial of
this statement and the incident closed
amid laughter.
In calling the meeting to order Chair
man Newhall said that the gathering had
for its object the perfection of the or
ganization of a bureau composed of the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,
the northern counties of California, and
the railway companies for the purpose of
systematizing the advertising of the re
sources of California.' It was not Intend
ed to . do any ''booming," but .only the
most legitimate. methods of attracting the
attention of the world to our.magriificent
resources would be employed. It was:in

facts regarding 'the -Golden State,' â¢ and
About twenty prominent gentlemen,
from various parts of the. State and from
San Francisco were' in attendance when
George A. Newhall, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, called the meet
ing' to order. The California State Board
of Trade was represented by W. HJ Mills,

PURPOSES OF THE MEETING.
a MEETING of vital importance
A& to San Francisco and the
y^_ra northern and central counties
J* m Ml of was held in the
-A Â¦*&>- Chamber of Commerce rooms
yesterday. The , project dis
cussed by' representatives of
development associations and civic bodies
of the sections named was the formation
of a federation of various commercial
bodies for the purpose of advancing the
business Interests of the State. The ob
jects desired to be attained were outlined
In resolutions adopted at the close of the
session, which will 'be read with interest
by the residents of the interior. .
W. H. Mills addressed the meeting at
some length. He referred to the excel
lent work done for the State by the ex
hibits of the Southern Pacific at ttae'Fan-
American Kxposition and at other places
In recent years. Their success spoke vol
umes for judicious advertising. This sys
tem of making our greatness known' to
the world was very much better than the
boasting, ranting advertising . too often
resorted to by individual advertisers."
Mills .paid some attention to the. oldest in-'
habitant, who for some reason or an
other is always "knocking" somebody or
something. The speaker advocated united
action if the best" results are to be at
tained. , He deprecated the sad lack of
local patriotism shown In certain sections
of the State, and expressed the belief that
the formation of- the proposed bureau
would do much to concentrate action' that
EXHIBITS DO. GREAT GOOD.
J. A. Filcher of the State Board of
Trade advocated advertising In all its
branches. :He said he had always expe
rienced, difficulty In getting the people of
the â¢ interior j to furnish him with copious
data regarding the resources of their sec
tions. ! He.'thought the formation of a bu
reau would accomplish great good for the
State.
At'the close of Green's address Chair
man Ne*whall suggested' that it would be
advisable to arrange for a meeting In the
near future In .which all the counties In
the vicinity of San Francisco would be
represented.- It was decided to carry out
the suggestion at an early date.
W. S. : Green of Coulsa opened the dis
cussion with a report on the work the
..northern counties had In contemplation.
He believed that a permanent exhibit oC
California products at Ogden would be
of imense benefit to the State! and he
recommended that such exhibit be made.
He suggested that similar exhibits shouki
be placed at Sacramento and Los An
geles for the benefit of tourists. These
exhibits should be in charge of widely
known men, whose experience would in
sure complete success. The advertising
of our resources by means of periodicals
and in other literature at these exhibits
was advocated. The suggestion was also
made that every business man of Califor
nia should visit the northern and central
counties of. the State In order, to famil
iarize himself with their magnificent re
sources. â¢ .
home builders, not speculators, would be
sought for by the organization. ..

A matter of complaint of the delegates
â¢was the fhinment of horses, mules and

British forces in South Africa. Secretary
Hay went over this subject very carefully

representations and to do whatever he
Â«^ouid to ameliorate the conditions in

President was the prime authority in such
matters and he recommended that the
Jioers see Roosevelt and ascertain his
views.
The principal object of the delegates
was to induce the United States Govern

present bloody struggle in South Africa.

they wanted and would be

official capacity. Secretary Hay talked
freely to them with this understanding.
It was a sort. of a mole growth over the
right eyelid and when the eye was turned
downward It had the appearance of be
ing a drooping eyelid.' Those who had
business dealings with. Bennett have ad
mitted this detail of the description given
the police, and this more than anything
else leads the . police to believe that they
are hunting down the right man.
The man who gave the information to
the police gives a better description .of
Bennett than any that r has been given
since the body-of. hla girlish victim was
found in the flat- on .Â¦ Sutter street. Hs
says that Bennett^did not have a cast in
his eye.
Detective Archie Hamlll .was detailed
to run down the important , clew and he
succeeded admirably ; wejl. â¢. This line of
investigation developed additional bits of
positive information as to the identity of
the man of mystery. The "-. evidence un
earthed by the police was of such a
startling nature .that Chief Wittman de
tailed Captain Seymour to conduct per
sonally, the search for the man who is
known only to them as John Bennett, but
about whose identity as an individual
much more is known..
The business man and Bennett struck
up a conversation, and as it was quite
near dinner time they repaired to the
Popular Restaurant, where Bennett told
the business man that he was a printer
and advertising man and that he was
getting up a paper for the Liquor Deal
ers' Association. He showed the business
man the form sheets of the paper ani
stated that it would be ready for publica
tion in a short time. After that the busi
ness man ate at the same table with Ben
nett a number of times.

Restaurant, turned and remarked: "They
can't do that; the liquor dealers are in
favor of the slot machines and they'll

An incendiary has been plying his voca
tion in San Rafael for some time, and
only recently, several disastrous fires have
been narrowly averted by timely discov
ery and prompt action. The incendiary
not only attacked dwellings, but business
houses and stores have suffered as well.
To-night, however, for the first time,
there has been loss of life. The citizens
are thoroughly aroused and 2 stringent
measures will be adopted to ferret out
and punish the culprit.
One of the neighbors of Mrs. Walsh
said late to-night that just after the alarm
was turned in he though he heard a
woman calling for help in the direction of
the house.
NEIGHBOR HEARS CRIES.
Mrs. Mary Walsh was one of the most
respected laUies in the community : in
which she lived. She was about 60 years
old. To-night her body is in charge of
the Coroner and an inquest will be held
to-morrow morning.
After a time the flames were subdued
sufficiently to permit the men to gain,
entrance by a. rear door. ; When, they had
effected^an-- en trance a^hor rible> sisrht met
their gaze. Mrs.' Walsh t s\'bbdy,v partially
I dressed, lay near the door. She had been
badly burned, but it is presumed that in
trying to escape, by the rear door she was
overcome by the heat and smoke and fell
exhausted before she could unlock the
door. The prompt action of the firemen
in getting water on the building had
saved the^'body from being charred be
yond recognition.
FIND BODY NEAR A DOOR.
The alarm of fire was turned In at 11:30
o'clock and the department reached the
scene- of the blaze promptly. The -fire
men found that the building, a frame
structure, was beyond saving. Although
the heat was intense several men entered
the house by a window in search of Mrs.
Walsh, who had been reported missing
by the person who first discovered the
blaze. The searchers reached her be<\
rocra, but she was not there. The bed
iiad been occupied, however, and 'at its
side some wearing apparel was found on
a chair. The volume of smoke made it
impossible for the .rescuers i to proceed
farther and^hey had to seek safety for
themselves.

can leaders in the SÂ«nate have yielded
to the strong pressure/behind the bill pro
viding for the repeal of the war revenue
tax, and have concluded to make a favor
able report on the measure without
further delay.' Senator Aldrich, chairman
of the finance committee having the bi:l
in charge, informed a few of his per-
Eonal friends to-day that the committee
Â¦would probably report the bill to the Sen
ate next week.- It was the original inten
tion of party leaders to hold tne war tax
repeal back until the closing hour3 of the
session and allow the proposed reduction
in revenues to be influenced by the
amount of expenditures by the present
Congress. Senator Aldrich, in discussing
the subject to-day, said:
The regular business of the session Is pro
gressing so satisiucionly ihut 1 see uo reason
for delaying early action on the war revenue
bill. The committee ha3 had the subject under
consideration and has practically agreed to re
port the bill back to the Senate substantially
as' It came from the huuse.
There are a number of verbal amendments,
but the salient features of the bill remain the
same. . The committee's decision was largely

is practically no opposition to its repeal except
from those who believe in collecting all the

WASHINGTON, March 5.â Governor
Taft was before the Senate Committee on
Immigration to-day and gave his views
on the subject of Chinese immigration to
the Philippines. He said the general con
viction of the commission was that Chi
nese ought not to be allowed to enter the
islands. He said .there were 50,000 Chi
nese in Manila,, and' his Judgment was
that there were not more than 150,000 in
the whole archipelago.
Governor Taft said the Filipino-Chinese
halfbreeds should not be kept out of the
United States, "because they are Filipinos
pure and simple." '
The best way for Congress to meet this
problem, said Governor Taft, is to estab
lish its policy with respect to the United
States and tnen treat tho Philippine IhI
ands, bo far as the Introduction of Chi
nese into the United States is concerned,
as if it were a foreign country, and then
to give the commission or tho legislative
body In the islands some power and au
thority in Its discretion to admit skilled
labor.
Representative Kahn of California, who
Introduced the Chinese exclusion bill tn
the House, hns received a dispatch from
Canada, saying the special commission 3t
the Dominion has Just submitted its re
port and It takes a position against Chi
nese Immigration airnllur to that taken
by those favorable to rigid exclusion in
the United States. '.Â¦':.
The Canadian Commission recommends
a treaty which will permit strict exclu
sion and in the meantime a $500 per head
tax on Chinese entering Canada. As
many Chinese come to the United States
by way of Canada, Kahn regards the
action' of the Canadian Commission as
having an Important bearing on the ex
clusion situation in the United States.

MARION, Ala., March 5.â ...n organized
mob of negroes is marching toward this
town with the intention of attacking the
County Jail and releasing two negro mur
derers, cne of whom is Luke Sanders, un
der sentence to be hanged to-morrow"."
Citizen soldiery is being organized and
at 9 o'clock iifty men were under arms
rea<ly to meet the inarching negroes.
Pickets have been thrown out on every
load ieading to the town and if a mob
appears a serious conflict, is feared. Early
In the night leading citizens held a con
ference and it was decided not to ask the
Governor for aid, as they believed it to
be the duty of the people to enforce law
and order.
When the reports were first received lit
tle credence was placed in them. Several
hours later couriers reported that real
danger existed and the citizens' posse was
immediately organized.
Luke Sanders and John Sanders, the
prisoners, are charged with the murder of
Road Overseer Melvin seven months
ago. Luke Sanders was sentenced to be
hanged and the Supreme Court refused a
new hearing, but recommended commu
tation x of sentence. . The matter was sent
io the State Pardon Commission and on
their recommendation the Governor re
fused to interfere. When the news of this
action reached Marion the negroes of
Perry County were incensed ami decided
to organize and release both men.
Perry County Is one of the black belt
counties and a large majority of the popu
lation is composed of negroes.
ROCHESTER, N. Y.. March 5.â Prince
Henry of Prussia traveled from Chicago
to Niagara Falls to-day, crossed the Can-'
udian frontier for a brief stay, during
which he was officially welcomed by. the
Dominion, and resumed his journey to*
night, bound for Boston over the New
York Central line.
His longest stop was at Niagara Falls,
which he saw bridged in with ice.' He
viewed the Horseshoe Falls . from Table
Rock, the American Falls from the ledgt
over the whirlpool on the Canadian shore,
rodj2 down the gorge to a point below thb
lower . whirlpool and there inspected the
plant of the Niagara Power Company,
which converts the forces of nature â¢ to
i the purposes of commerce. He was much.
j impressed by the falls .and as he stood
! on Table Rock, looking across at flw
j Horseshoe, he said: "It is magnificent; it
j is grand." . ;->Â¦>':
: He was much Impressed also by the
swirling rapids down in the gorge and
when he left his car at the whirlpool ho
stood for several minutes watching the
j tumbling of the waters.
i The special train had traversed the dis
tance between Milwaukee and Chicago.
: crossed Indiana and was well on its way
! over Ohio before Prince Henry arose. He
I was worn out when he left Milwaukee and
did not respond to demonstrations by the
people of Toledo or Sandusky. He did not
receive notice of the intention of the cit
izens of Toledo to formally receive him
nnd when he did it was too late to get up,
fj Toledo did not see him.
At Cleveland there was a friendly dem
onstration. At Erie there was a great
crowd. Women and children were wedged
in against the train and the effort to
check the (twirling crowd was useless.
Kevcral women futnted. Mm. Harriet
Urldley and Miss Gridley, widow and
daughter of Captain C. V. Gridley of the
, Olympla, wero received In the train by Ad
miral Evans, who presented tlion to the
j 1'rlnce. â¢,,; Â¦
I Crowds at All Stations.
All through the morning, as the train
, ran through a corner of Pennsylvania and
I out Into the State of New York there
, were crowds at the stations anxious to
j see the Prince and tender assurances of
; friendship. At Buffalo Mayor Knight
i welcomed the Prince and the local. Oer
i man ringing sang. It was 2:io
'Â¦Â¦ o'clock when the special arrived at Buf
falo and fifteen minutes later It was
! steaming out to Niagara Falls. At Ni
â¢Â¦ agara Falls station the Prince was met
j by Mayor Butler and a large reception
! committee and formally bidden to the
. city.
.When Mayor Butler concluded Dr. Wll
1 Ham Snyder spoke In behalf of the Ger
| mans of the city. The Prince did not
â¢ make a speech in response, but thanked
j them both for their greeting. The Prince
! was .then driven to the Canadian side,
accompanied by a mounted escort. Mid
i way on the bridge which spans the rapids
i the Prince was met by the man who spoke
' for the Canadian Government and people.
I Major; F. S.- Maude, military secretary for
! Lord MJnto, Governor General of Can
; ada, presented the formal greeting of his
: chief, and R. Harcourt, Minister of Edu
Â¦ cation for Ontario, delivered! the address
passed by the Legislature of Ontario.
: The latter- was worded as follows.
If It may please Your Royal Highness, we.

Ontario, in Parliament assembled,- -bÂ«Â£ leave '

Karl Mueller presented an address In
behalf of the municipality of Berlin, On
tario, and F. Bopp, German Consul at
Montreal; Samuel Nordheimer, German
Consul at Toronto, and W. Hespeler, Ger
man Consul at Winnipeg, were intro
duced. The Prince thanked the Canadians
for their cordiality, and leaving his
American military escort behind was
driven to the Canadian tilde. After his
carriage turned up toward the falls Mayor
Butler, who, with Admiral Evans, was
driving with him, said to him: \
"There at the gallery is the best view
of the American falls, but on account of
snow you cannot get to It" .
"You may not be able to climb across
there, but I am going to," said the
Prince.
Climb in a Snowdrift.
Suiting the action to the 'word the
Prince Jumpoil out of the carriage and
climbed through the snow drift to the
gallery on the ledge over the rapids,
where he showed the way. After viewing
the American falls the Prince was driven
to Table Rock, where he again dismount
ed. The Horeshoo Falls was clear of ice,
nnd he got an â¢ excellent view of them.
There v/as a largo space of clear water
below the falls, but midway to the first
bridge the Ice was still Intact and llrm
The Prince was driven back to the town
of Niagara Falls and there transferred to
a special eloctrlc car for the trip down
the gorge. He left the car at the Whirl
pool Rapids and with hl3 suite walked
down to the bank. In returning to Nia
gara he was taken to the power-house of
the Niagara Power Company and with W.
B. RafiKln, vice president of the plant, as
hla guide, he made a tour, of the place
and asked a number of questions about
the amount of power generated, the
means userTandthe manner and distance
of the transmission. Â¦ '
As the party was leaving the power
house. Admiral Evans felt something tu<r
iring at his coat. He turned to find the
hand of a youthful looking: pickpocket In
one of his pockets. As the admiral shook
him off he coolly Â¦ said: â¢ "Young man
you'll, find my, purse In another pocket"
The admiral did not delay long enough to
turn tho youth over to the police. At fi
o'clock. the Prince was back and aboard
his train. Fifteen minutes later It de
parted for Boston, brief stops at Roches
ter and Syracuse being scheduled.

than go back to the land of their birth,
and said they would commit suicide first.
Sharp was? touched' by their love for

" The resolution was presented ' by Dr.
Buckley und seconded by Dr. Ward. Tho
liittor h;iKI that- there could be but onÂ«
choice between the two sttes and that
was, the Pattrldgo tract,, which was su
perior to the other in point of accessi
bility and appointments already Installed
on the. site. Tho resolution follows:
' That the Pattrlfige tract be the official se
lection of this board ns a site for an Isolation
Hospital for contagious dlscaiics. Â»
The Health Board 'gave the occupants
of the building at 512-514 Post street thirty
days in which' to put the premises In a
sanitary condition.. The board at the last
meeting- condemned the- building as un
safe and a menace to health.
The Board of Health met yesterday and
adopted a resolution declaring in. favor of
the Pattridge tract on the . Bay View
farm as the most , available site for' a
pesthouse. The board recommended to
the Board of Supervisors the purchase of
the site, which has been offered to the
city for $12,500.
. There are several buildings on ithe site,
which. the board believes can bo convert
ed at once Into a hospital' for the accom
modation of smallpox patients. The tract
offered by the Bay View Land Company
is deemed unsuited for hospital purposes
by reuson-of Its Inaccessibility at tho
present time. It will be necessary to
build a road to tho site, which the Board
of Works estimates will coat $3600.
All the contests over the /estate of the
late Adolph Sutro 'have- ,* been compro-.
mised and now all that remains as a bar
to the distribution' of the estate Is . the
question of the '.ownership ' the Sutrd;
library, which is claimed,; by /Mrs. Dr:
Merrltt. In the philanthropist's will was
a clause giving t to Mrs. . Merritt /'his 11-V
brary." Whether ' Sutro 'Â¦ meant his pri
vate library or ithe. one he . purchased
shortly before; his death, anfl which he had
determined . to pfe'sent' to the city,' is a
much mooted question, the settlement of
which has occupied the attention of the
courts for tho,lastvyear.- v ' *
.The cstate"1s now, ready for distribu
tion. A hearing of n petition for partiul
distribution came up in Department 9 of.
tho Superior Court yesterday, but wan
put over until March 0. A motion. to put
thd matter over for four weeks was â¢ op
posed by Attorney J. C. Campbell, who
announced that the various contests over
the Sutro estate had been compromised,
and that therefore tho petition should bo
given a speedy hearing, in order Uiat the
estate could bo nettled and an end put to
the litigation. ,
Tho contests referred to by Campbell are
those commenced by Mrs. Clara Kluge-
Butro and Mrs. Rosa V. Morblo. Some
weeks upo tho first named contestant uc.
cepted $100,000 and dismissed her action.

the hair with a spray of orange blossoms
and drawn through her engagement ring.

and pearl sunburst, the wedding gift of

of foliage and pink roses, with a largo
double heart of pink roses overhead.
Many sprays of almond blossoms wera
also used throughout the rooms. The

PERSONAL MENTION.
Judging from these reports it appears it is quite
feasible for telegraph . companies to provide a system
of communication that would be storm-proof! Even
if it would not be advisable at present to adopt the
system over the jwjiole country, it might be put
into use between the* principal cities of the Union
The system, it appears,. is quite extensive, for the
report goes on to say: "The entire New York divii'
â¢sion is protected by the electro-pneumatic block-sig
nals at present, as is also the main line as far west
as Paoli, and about two-thirds of the distance be
tween Altoona and Pittsburg. The ; Atlantic City
division of the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad is
also equipped and operated by the electric blocks^
The system is being extended over the lines to
Washington, and west on the main line as rapidly as
the comprehensive improvements in progress on
those lines will admit."
The New York Times speaks of it as /'an auto
matic system of block signals," and says it is not
liable to injury from accumulations of snow or ice.
Referring to the operation of the system during the
storm it says: "It is not an exaggeration to say that
the atmospheric conditions which played such havoc
with the overhead wires of the telegraph and tele
phone companies subjected it to a crucial'test. The
engineer of signals of the Pennsylvania Railroad re
ceived reports .yesterday from air portions of the
roads on which the electric system has been installed
that there was not the slightest interruption in the
operation of the signals. Although the usefulness of
over ten miles of telegraph and telephone wire was
destroyed on the New York division alone, not an
inch of the protected wire in the tubes was harmed."
Underground wires within the limits of cities are
feasible and will doubtless come in time. That
would prevent danger of death. It is not practicable,
however, to place wires under ground in the long
stretches between city and city, and consequently
some other method will have to be adopted to main
tain communication securely through the storm sea
son. It appears from reports that an available sys
tem has been already devised for such purpose and
put into operation on the Pennsylvania Railroad. It
stood the test of the late storms and seems to give
satisfaction.
ONE of the results of the recent storms in the
East, followed, as they were, by a general
collapse of telegraph and telephone wires,
has been a demand on the part of the public for the
adoption of some system that will render wires
storm-proof. Within the area of cities the collapse
of the wires meant something more than interrupted
communication;' Several persons were killed by live
wires strewn along the ground, and in commenting
upon the fatalities one writer says the alternative is
plainâ "we must either bury men or bury the wires."

"The West ought to follow out a sys
tem of symmetrical development if It Is
hoped to build up these millions of acres
of neglected country, to induce Immigra
tion, to make cities and towns, to make a
greater and a better nation through more
individual agricultural J freeholders," said
Colonel Irish, in conclusion.
Frank Benton, who has been In the cat-
tle-ralslng business for thirty years In tha
West, and who now has two ranches in
Northern Colorado and, Southern Wyo
ming, delivered an address on "Practical
Illustrations of the Leasing, System and
Its Benetlts."
â¢ The revenue to be derived by the leas
ing of the public flomain, 400,000,000 acra.i
at 2 cents an acre, will give a total of
$8,000,000 to be used for .the construction
of Irrigation enterprises, and what will
follow? The most profitable result will be
the realizing of winter feed for stock, aa
no one will intelligently advocate the idea
of an Increase of grain acreage.
John P. Irish of California made an ad
dress in favor of the enactment of a law
to authorize the leasing of public lands.
It is necessary, he said, that the 600.000.
000 acres of forest land be preserved to
help hold the snows of winter and fur
nish the nec,essary water for the western
pioneers' homes and other uses. There
are 400,000,000 acres of land not fit for any
other use than the great one of devel
oping and growing and fattening the cat
tle, sheep and horses, and which, accord
ing to a recently published statement, by
overcrowding, was being depleted at the
rate of 5,000,000 acres a year. Further than
this, the great scramble for this grazing
country was resulting . In the loss of aOO
lives a year by sanguinary encounters.
DENVER, March 5râ Discussion of the
land-leasing question was opened in tho
American Cattle Growers' Convention this
morning.
There is nothing small nor mean about a measure
of that kind. It is generous as well as patriotic.
Washington might have) asked such things forher
seif alone, but she has been liberal. She asks only
that the nation shall support them and that the first
development of them sha 1 be at the capital as an ob
ject lesson. Just how inuch money would be-re
quired for the programme is .not estimated, but it
will certainly be. large. The surplus would be 1 noth
ing to it. There would. \c a chance to put all the
money now in the treasury, into immediate circula
tion and issue a lot of papfer money in addition.
â¢It is npt likely the Government will undertake the
proposed department, butj the very introduction of
the bill is itself pleasant.: \ It is conducive to good
feeling between the capital 'and the 'provinces. It
shows that we are not forgotten by the haughty as
sociates of.Embassadcrs and naval officers. The
capital may be indifferent to Vmr politics,, our morals
and our art, but it feels a \yarm interest in our phy
sical well being. The. suggestion that we should be
provided ..with public laundries and baths is itself a
proof of affection.. Had the petitioners been callous
and harsh they would have gjne no further than ; to
recommend for us the usual" [Washington, means of
purification â a coat of whitewash.
Such being the prevailing opinion on the subject,
it is gratifying to note! that the denizens of the capi
tal have really an interest in the country and are not
neglectful of the public welfare. Some of them
have induced Senator- Mason of Illinois to introduce
a bill providing for the establishment of a depart
ment of physical culture, for the purpose of promot
ing the health, beauty and happiness of the people in
every State in the Union. The bill provides that the
proposed department shall provide under national
control and at national) expense jjublic parks, play
grounds, gymnasiums, fountains, baths, laundries,
theaters and periodicals! and' enforce shorter work
ing hours and the observance of a Saturday half
holiday. !,!
OUR esteemed fellow citizens of the national
capital are supposed to be so much absorbed
in themselves as to be careless of the coun
try at large. It is, known they have no vote, belong
to no political party and take no interest in elec
tions. Furthermore, as they have neither a farming
industry, a manufacturing industry nor a commercial
industry, they care nothing about trade, tariffs or
free silver. Finally,\as they havft a society ably led
by Embassadors and supported by naval officers,
they are indifferent > to social sets in New York or
San Francisco. Hence the belief that they care noth
ing for the" outer world, but live like the epicurean
gods, indifferent to all around them.
FOR PHYSICAL CULTURE.
One of the, results of the visit of Prince *Henry is'
the instruction of the American people that the title
of the Kaiser is that of "German Emperor" and not
"Emperor of Germany." It may appear to us like a
difference .between tweedledum and tweedledee, but
among the Gerjnans it is- a difference big enough to
fight about if occasion come.
Hugh Hastings, State historian of New York, said
in a recent address before the Sons of the Revolution
at Troy: "The battle of Walloomsac â persistently
spoken of- by the New England w'riters as 'Benning
ton'âis claimed by New England historians as a
New England battle, when New England is no more
entitled to it than Pennsylvania is entitled to the bat
tle of Trenton, for the Trenton battle-field is mucli
nearer to Pennsylvania than the battle-ground of
Walloomsac is to Bennington." It is needless to
say that just now whenever the New Englanders
have to pronounce Mr. Hastings' name they froth
at the mouth.
WEST DEMANDS
THE LEASING OF
PUBLIC LANDS
SACRAMENTO, March 5.â The direct
ors of the Chamber of Commerce,
in line with a. policy of increased
activity which has been undertaken,
decided upon engaging a general man
ager, who shall . have charge â¢ of the
details of organization and promo
tion. H. A. French was chosen to
fill the position and entered upon his new
A similar situation would develop itself if Govern
ment ownership extended to street car lines, water
works, lighting plants Â«or any other public utility.
The officers in charge of a municipality in possession
of a lighting plant, for example, could hardly be ex
pected to authorize competition. Progress, in effect,
halts where Government ownership begins.
This is one of the factors that should be duly re
garded in every serious consideration of the ques-"
tion of Government ownership of any kind of utility
that can be left to private hands. So long as the
Government itself keeps its hands off competition is
always possible, 1 and under the. stimulus of competi
tion or the fear of competition private, parties are
compelled to promptly adopt every improvement of
fered. No such stimulus can affect a Government.
The British example teaches the'lesson dearly. Mar
coni's telegraphy may be applied for transmitting
messages beyond the three-mile limit; of the coast,
but inland it is forbidden. *
The situation is a logical and almost inevitable out
come of Government ownership. The Postmaster
General is aware that his Government has invested
a large amount of money in telegraph lines and is
dependent upon public patronage of the lines to ob
tain a revenue to sustain them. He naturally feels
that it is his official duty to guard the lines against
competition. Progress in telegraphy is therefore
stopped until the Government itself gets ready to
adopt the improved n-ethods.
Marconi is reported to have stated the British
situation with respect to wireless telegraphy in this
way: An act incorporating telegraph lines in Great
Britain was passed by Parliament in 1870 with a
clause providing that no person may maintain tele
graph stations from rny point in Great Britain to
another point within the kingdom, but a station may
be maintained if the end of the line is in another
country- That clause, Marconi went on to say, is
now applied to his cempany. His stations used to
communicate with ships more than three miles from
the coast are of course not within the scope of the
law, for the messages pass beyond the jurisdiction
of the empire. Marconi reports that he once pointed
out to the Postmaster General that if a ship were
stranded in a fog or storm within the three-mile
limit and should telegraph for aid the Marconi sta
tions could not answer without violating the law,
whereupon the Postmaster General informed him
that in such cases there would be no prosecution.
That assurance, however, was of course unsatisfac
tory. The inventor closed his statement by saying:
"Three years ago I asked for a license for a short
inland line, but it was refused. It is very difficult to
get any concessions from them which they need 1 not
give."
BY the action of the British Government in for
bidding Marconi to establish stations for
operating wireless telegraphy within the
kingdom a striking illustration is given of one of
the evils inherent in Government ownership of pub
lic utilities. Great Britain owns and operates
telegraph lines, and as a consequence forbids private
competition. Were the lines in private hands com
petition of course would be available at any time and
would find encouragement from the public and from
the Government. There would thus be a ready wel
come for every improvement in telegraphy and every
increased facility in that kind of communication.
The Government, however, is not subject to compe
tition and holds fast to. the old way.
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP.
Since those statements may be taken as expres
sions of public opinion in South Carolina, there is
reason to hope we are nearing the end of Tillmanism.
It was an uprising of the'people'of South Carolina
that carried him into office,- and it is now time for
another to svvÂ«ep him out of.it forever. - - -:- -.- '.
The Boston' Journal says: "Better late than never
should ,Bbstonians, realize the danger spot they have
in the Common. For years, at : night,* the historic
.heart of the :ity has been a place to which the pru
dent and un; ccompanied person gives a wide_berth.
In the sumner it is infested with corpulent tramps
and in winte .with unspeakable brutes and highway,,
robbers." .:.L :tf. us rejoice that San Francisco is not
Boston. We â¢ have troubles of our own, but none
Tillman, thjy say, is not a Bourbon. -He is the
man who dei ounced Bourbonism from stump to
stump, rouse< the â¢ poor "whites, "of the up "country
against the Charleston. aristocrats," and turned the
first families' out of office and- very nearly out of
politics. These families would be. very glad to! see
both Tillman and M.cLaurin turned out of the Sen
ate. They ha re no use for Â¦ either of the fighters'.
. The Charleston News and Courier, in commenting
upon the statement in-fillman's apology to the Sen
ate that he Viad ho experience. in legislative affairs
before he eirered, that body, and that his four years
of' service a.L Governor of South Carolina had un
fitted him.fp the Senate, says the apology was even
worse than; the' offense; that "there .is nothing in the
office of Governor of South Carolina to encourage
the manner^ of the prize-ring," and adds:, x "It would
be better for the State and for public decency if the
country could be spared the" humiliation of being
'represented by men who cannot control themselves.
No > punishment- that the Senate could inflict upon
the South Carolina Senators would be too severe for
their outijageous- conduct."
The Columbia State is equally severe in its con
demnatioij. It declares an inability to understand
why Tillnian and McLaurin should have become so
suddenly, fierce in the Senate when they had been de- -
nouncing each other. 1 as liars and worse for months
before the present session of Congress began. âIt
says: "We are constrained to declare our regret that
Senators Tillman "and McLaurin did not carry out
their agreement of last summer to resign their seats
and appeal to the people of South Carolina for vindi
cation. And we think we can say for the white
voters of the State, without regard to faction, that
they would be glad to have an opportunity now af
forded them to vote on the fitness of Benjamin R.
Tillman and John L. McLaurin to represent them' in
the Senate of the United States." I
HOME VIEWS OF TILLMAN.
DOWN in South Carolina the "good people"
and tit press are indignant; over the asper-
Isions <ast upon their- State by the press of
the country 'g nerally in discussing the fight between
Tillman an.d' u IcLaurin. ; With 'a special earnestness
they resent tl e imputation that Tillman represents
the Bourbon element of /^ South; .Carolina, or any
other element associated 'with the old families who
ruled the State Â¦from the/days of the Revolution" to
the days of liampton and Butler.

Surely such a showing as that cannot be satisfac
tory to any American. We have become the.fore
most commercial nation on the globe without suf
ficient ocean-going vessels to carry the trade of a
third-rate power. For nearly all our imports and
exports we pay tribute to foreigners. We transfer to
others the wealth that should be used in building
American ships and maintaining American seamen.
It is time to put an end to that folly.
Britain has increased from a little over 40 per cent
of the total in 1S60 to over 50 per cent In 1500. But aa
her tonnage is largely steam, she actually carries about
62 per cent of the world's goods; while ours, being still
largely sail, we carry actually not over 12 per cent of
the world's tonnage, and we probably carry less than
12 per cent of the oversea freight of the world.
Actually we have over 100.000 tons less than forty
years ago, and relatively we have sunk from 40 per
cent of the total to 17 per cent.
To obtain markets we must have the means of
transporting our goocte to any part of the globe
where the best market is to be found. There. was,
a time when we had a large share in the ocean com
merce of the world, but of late we have fallen*.be
hind, and now we have toÂ» pay tribute to foreigners
to carry our goods for us. A recent summary of our
shipping as compared with that of Great Britain
presents the situation in this way:
"World's tonnage, 1860, 13.450,000 tons.
Of this Britain had 5.710.9G8 tons and the United
States had 5,239,175 tons.
We almost equaled Britain. We carried 40 per cent
of the world's tonnage and she a little more.
World's tonnage, 1900, 28,900,000 tons.
Of this we had 5,164,000 tons, while Britain is credited
with 14,600,000 tons. â¢ _/~
In addition to the argument of fair play, however,
there is a special argument in favor of promoting
our ocean-going commerce. The restless energies
of our people have now reached a point where we
produce in almost all lines of industry. an amount
of goods greater than our own people can consume.
We have farm products and manufactured products
of many kinds in sufficient abundance to profusely
supply the home market and leave a surplus over.
Fob- that surplus we must either find â¢ a market
abroad or we, shall, as the saying is, "fry in our own
fat." We shall have periods of overproduction, in
which industry will yield little or no profit, the farm
ers will be iri distress, the mills will shut down,
workingmen will be unemployed and we shall have
hard times in the midst of plenty.
A protective system becomes justifiable only when
it is applied equally to all the industries of a people.
If we protect American industries on land we should
also protect American industries on the seas. The
American sailor ought not to be the only American
workingman who is left exposed to the competition
of foreign labor, nor should the ship-owner be the
only American whose property and capital is demed
a fair degree of protection against the subsidized en
terprises of foreign capitalists. â¢
SENATOR FRYE'S strong presentation of the
merchant marine bill gives encouragement to
the expectation that Congress will at last
enact this measure of justice* to one. of the greatest
interests of our people. Measures providing for an
increase of our ocean-going commercial fleets have
been long under consideration and the public. is
fairly familiar with the arguments on either side."
The Republican party has repeatedly pledged itself
to enact some measure for that purpose and the peo
ple have sustained it. The debate, therefore, ought
to be deemed complete. It has been heard, consid
ered and voted on, and the judgment of the people
has been in favor of the measure.

The newly organized Association of
Chiefs of Police of the Pacific States con
cluded Its session yesterday and ad

At the meeting held yesterday morning
and afternoon in the Police Commission
ers' chamber at the Hall of Justice the
heads of the various police departments
on the coast discussed many Interesting
and Important subjects bearing on polica
matters. They discoursed long and in
tently on the social evil and handled tho
subject without gloves. Chief Wlttman.

In giving tho association their views en
the various methods of controlling the so
cial evil, which they deemed necessary in
all larire cities. '
Then the subject of criminals In all their
various classifications was taken up.
Nearly every member of the association
recited interesting incidents of detecting
criminals and identifying them by the
different methods they have at their com
mand. The Bertilllon system, adopted by
the National Identification Bureau. wa9
discussed at length. Chief AVittman im
parting to the members of the association
considerable Information he collected on
the subject during his trip of Investiga
tion throughout the various large cities of
the East and while attending the mectlnff
of the police authorities from all over tho
United States held at Atlanta some time
ago. Chief M'ittman explained the Ber
tlllion system In detail.
Will Induce Co-operation.
Chief Elton of Los Angeles stated that
the system was extensively used in hl3
department and he said Le had found it
a practical and efficient method of iden
tifying criminals. After the discussion
Chief Sullivan of Sacramento moved that
the members of the association take Im
mediate steps to induce the Board of Su
pervisors or County Trustees of the sec
tions over which they have control to In
stall the Bertilllon system.
The members of the association becama
quite chatty on this Important subject ana
Judging from the drift of the conversation
they will go back to their homes with the
firm intention of taking more Interest in
the exchange of photographs of criminals
and suspects and the work of assisting
their colleagues in the apprehension of
criminals wanted In other sections. This
feature is one of the principal ones con
templated by Chief Wlttman when ho
called the chiefs of the coast cities to
gether.
At the mornlnjr session Chief Wlttman
was elected president of the association.
Chief Elton of Los Angeles was elected
vice president and Chief Hodgklns of
Oakland was elected secretary and treas
urer. *â¢':Â¦'â"

Hearing that'chlef Kldward of San Joso
was about to resign his position as the
head of the Police Department of that
city, the association adopted the following
resolution:
Whereas. Our esteemed colleague, James A.
Kldward. Chief of Police of San Jose, has an
nounced his intention of resigning bis office,
which he has so ably filled for the past eight
years, and to retire to private life; *and
whereas, he has by his uniform courtesy and
prompt attention to police matters and his
firm demeanor in dealing 'with criminals mads
himself a. necessity In police- ' work on this
coast.' Therefore be it
Resolved, by . the Association of Chiefs of
Police of the Pacific Slope In convention as
sembled. That should he persist in his deter
mination* to resign the law-abiding citizens of
this coast in general and the citizens of San
Jose In particular would suffer a loss that will
not be easy Jo replace and the association
would lose one of Its most valued and active*
iremSers. ' V * "- j'; Â¦'-Â¦Â»
The above resolution, which fe quite a
compliment to Chief Kldward's efficiency
as a police official, was introduced by
Chief Sullivan of Sacramento and ur.ai
mously adopted. The convention ad
journed at 5 o'clock to enjoy a banquet,
which opened at 6 o'clock at an uptown
restaurant. The banquet, which was a
very enjoyable affair, was tendered by
Chief of Police Wlttman. Chief Wlttman
has other entertainments in view for hi3
guests, which will be enjoyed by them be
fore they leave for their homes.

any soap will do. But if you care at all about
â¢^ ' the thing which is to be washed, you must
think twice before you act. Any soap will clean linens
and muslins, but Ivory Soap leaves them as white as
snow. Any soap will clean sheets and table cloths, *but
Ivory Soap leaves no coarse, strong odor. Try it once!

EASTERN MARKETS.
Receipts of Beans have Increased very much
since the , high water along the Sacramento
River and are now large, as . will | be seen.
This is due to the desire among country hold
ers to get their stock Into safe and dry places,
hence they are 1 sending it here. "Most of the
receipts are going into store, which is a good
thing,' for, if they were thrown on the market
lower prices would result. The market Is de
void of demand and could not stand the pres
sure of heavy offerings. The feeling Is rather
weak than otherwise. Â¦ -
Alfalfa Seed is still Wafer and very flrm. A
brisk European demand has drawn heavily
upon stocks in Utah and Colorado, hence ship
ments from those States to this market are
much lighter than usual. Again, the high
prices for Alfalfa Hay this sea son. have led
to a brisk demand for seed.

CHICAGO, March 5.â Wheat bulls had fair
encouragement soon after the opening. Cables
were only slightly higher, but Northwestern
receipts were much reduced. Added to | this
was the bullish factor of dry weather reports
from the Southwest. The effect of the early
bullish surroundings was not felt with full
force until nearly an hour after the opening
Trade in general was slack, but the crop con
ditions finally awakened buyers from the coun
try. May wheat here -opened a shade lower to
unchanged at 76Vfe@7GVi'c and gradually ad
vanced to 7(i94c. - Shorts had covered to some
extent, though many speculators paid little
attention to the damage reports. Near the end
of the session May eased oft to Its lower open
ing price and closed barely firm at 76%c.
Dullness was the chief characteristic of the
trade In corn, however. May closed barely
firm, i&JEf'Vic up ot til%@62c.
There was an early demand in oats which
held price:: firm. Later profit-taking caused
a weak market. May sagged and closed easv
W,ic down at 44%@44i/4C.
Provisions suffered from, the Inflirenees of a
heavy run of hogs at the yards and the con
sequent low prices. May pork closed 20c down,

of the -winter crop is now the controlling fac
tor 'in-thaVmarket'and many report^ ' pro and
con. are tbeing received . from . the belt. The
Government weather and crop report giveÂ«
much damage in the South and Southeast from
the elements, and in- one or two States a good
deal of. the crop will be plowed up and other
produce planted. Missouri reports a large.in
crease in the acreage this year, with the fields
generally In good condition. Previous damage
reports from Kansas - and Oklahoma are'con
firmed, yet 18 points in the leading wheat sec
tions of Kansas glve-the damage as slight. The
country elevator stocks in the Northwest are
getting low and stocks at Minneapolis will
probably decrease 350,000 bushels during the
week. The Northwestern elevator people think
their crop overestimated by 25,000,000 bushels.

Condition of Business.
THE SITUATION AS SEEN. BY A NEW
YORK BANKER.
The New Ymk circular of Henry Clews payy:
"The Stock Exehurge situation shows little
change. Stocks appear to be very firmly held
liy the big interests which have persistently
jirotccted the market against all attacks for
months past. Xo doubt they would like to Fee
prices rise to a higher level, and it may be
they v.-ill use their efforts In this direction
Wbea opportunity offers. At the moment, how
ever, circumstances are not t-ntire.ly In their"
favor. The business situation, it is true. U,
excellent in many respects, and the outlook is
for a good spring trade in nearly all parts of
the country, save perhaps in some portions of
XhÂ° Scstnwcst, where thort crops of corn and
cotton, together with vr-cent unfavorable weath
er, ere acting detrimentally upon business. So
far there is no sipn of abatement in the activ
ity of the iron trade, a number of furnaces hav
ir.R soid their full capacity until January.
lrtO.". The dry poods trade is a!so in excellent
condition, cotton goods being in small supply
jmd pocd demand at advancing prices. In the
iadustria! world there are few. If any, signs
of overproduction. Two obstacles to a bull
market exist just now which cannot be over
looked, viz.. the monetary situation and the
indisposition of the public to enter ae buyers.
Bank reserves are unusually low. while loans
are unprecedentedly high; factors not very
conducive to bullish operations, especially as
foreign selling of securities is forcing gold ex
ports, and the periodic stringency incidental
to April settlements is close at hand. The
contemplated Japamesr loan, which has been
expected in some quarters, Â¦will make a con
siderable drain upon our gold supplies, al
tlictiph actual shipment! will not be made at
Inconvenient p^rieds. It is worthy of note that
ratlruad eaxninps are net so uniformly increafc
lng. that are growincr more frequent
_n<l that somewhat unsatisfactory reports are
forthconÂ»nf: regarding winter wheat. In the
face of fucIi facts stock? should bÂ» bought vrlth
discretion. There are indications of active
manipulati'-in which may become more aegreÂ»
fclve v.itli the approach of spring, but until the
monetary Fituation Improves we advise caution
in operation- on the long side."

.Prices for.; Butter remain unchanged, but
supplies are somewhat larger and the market
is not as llrin as it has been. Dealers are
rather' expecting a decline. Still, if another
stormy period -sets in, the market may keep
up for some little time yet.
There is no further change in Cheese.
The weakness in Eggs continues, and the
Exchange reduced its quotations to 12@13c for
ranch -.. and . 12c for gathered. Stocks are as
large as ever, and the dainp weather prevents
the commission merchants from cold storing
to get rid of the surplus. There is still some
shipping' demand from the north, though the
home . production up there Is Increasing and
Â¦will" shortly , obviate the necessity for calling
on this market for supplies. Receipts here

fair to continue so for some time now. Yes

sudden constriction of supplies which was
dreaded yesterday as a result of the unex
pectedly heavy demands converging upon the
New York money market. The calling of sub
scriptions to the San Francisco traction merger
proved a relieving force to some decree in
stead of aggravating the stringency, as had
been feared. This v>s due to the fact tMat
foreigners are subscribers to the syndicate and
their remittances to Xew York in response to
the call "relaxed somewhat the foreign demand
for gold. No further actual engagements of
pold were made to-day and. not all the gold
that was expected was packed for to-morrow's
pteamer. The movement of sold to !?an Fran
cisco has Eonie puzzling features about it and
the applications to Washington authorities for
permission to transfer $50,(100,000 to $00,000,000
to San Francisco arouse surmise as to other
possible demands. Money in London was ap
preciably easier to-day and sterling at Paris
rose a fraction. Both of these movements are
an index of relaxed pressure for sold upon
NVw York. The absence of apprehended
stringency in the money market -was supple
mented by some good returns of gross earn
ings of railroads for the fourth week of Feb
ruary and by confident assurances that there
was no cause for fear of labor troubles In the
anthracite coal fields. The death of Leonard
Lewisohn Induced some selling of Amalgamated
Copper, but the stock found support. Missouri
Pacific was under some pressure, but rallied
with the rest of the market and closed with a
small net gain. Steel stocks maintained their
inertness and moved within a fractional range.
There were wide movements In a number of
less Important stocks. Realizing made some
inroads upon the best prices and the closing
was dull and irregular, but with substantial
net gains remaining.
The bond market was somewhat irregular.
Total sales, par value. 52.920.000.
United States 2s advanced M per cent on

LEY CAMPBELL'S CLASSIC DRAMA, "THE WHITE SLAVE." '
Rev. Dr. E. R. Diile last night delivered
an Interesting lecture on the city of Lon
don before a large audience of British-
Americans at the Academy of Sciences.
The lecture was given under the auspices
of the British-American Association, and
its president. William Grecr Harrison, in
introducing the lecturer, took occasion to
tou^h on the relations existing between
this country and England, which he
prophesied were bound to draw the two
nations closely together on all the great
questions conironting the world.
The lecture of Dr. Dille was illustrated
by a series of stereopticon views of the
notable buildings and streets of London.
The familiar scenes struck a responsive
chord in the breasts of the audience,
which was composed mostly of English
people, and both the pictures and the
wor.is of the speaker were frequently ap
plauded.
In addition to the lecture Master and
Misa Gray rendered a piano duet, Miss
Caroline L.. Crew sang two soprano solos,
Miss Hay Scott gave a contralto solo and
Mrs. Josephine Crew-Aylwln played two
selections on the piano.

The patrons of Vthe â¢ Grand Opera-house
are finding "A Contented Woman" much
to their liking. It is the best thing that
has been done since George Ober s en
gagement at the popular house. Ober
himself has in Uncle Todie a part that

Margaret Terry as Aunt Jim and Lillian
Albertson as Grace Holmeare are much

"At tho White Horse Tavern," at tho
Alcazar Theater, is pleasing tho large
houses that the dainty, little comedy de
bcrvea and is getting. The piece Is ex
cellently cast, notably good work being
done all along the line. George Osbourne
ehlnes conspicuously as the fiery Pupa
Giesticke, but the whole company does
well. It Is worth any one's while to drop
in at the Alcazar this week, and the
likelihood will be that it will not be his
only visit. Praticularly .good Is the set
ting of the little-play.
"The Serenade" is a hit of unusual pro

man makes a great hit with his topical
?>ongs. Cunningham, Anna Llchtcr .and
Frances Graham aro thoroughly compe

Harold -Webb, Cashman' and

When Bartley Campbell first produced
his powerful play, "The White Slave,'.'
Frank Drew was selected for the. charac
ter part of Mr. Stitch, the comical -lawyer.
That was twenty years ago, and the vet
eran actor has been doing Mr. Stitch ever
since. The entire company presenting
"The White Slave" is one of the strong
est that has been seen hero in a long
while. In it thero are members who havc
been playing in the piece for years, even
incluaxng several of the originals.
SIXTY years on the stage and
twenty years in the same char
acter. This is the record of the
veteran comedian, Frank N.
Drew, who comes to the Cali
fornia next Sunday in Hartley Camp
bell's classic drama. "The White Slave."
Drew is a â¢ brother of John Drew
Sr., father of the popular actor of thr.t
name. Long before . the present John
Drew came into the world the two broth
ers and their wives constituted almost a
company by themselves and at that time
were recognized as among â¢ tho foremost
of America's exponents of tho dramatic
art. With them were associated Joseph
Jefferson, John Sleeper Clark, John IS.
Owens and many other shining lights of
tho stage. When Joseph Jeff erson â¢ pro
duced his memorable "Rip Van Winkle"
both Frank Drew and his sistcr-ln-law,
Mrs. John Drew, were In the cast. They

his mother was influenced by Edward

her visit him. IIÂ« said the bitterness be

brought about by his mother deeding the
property to Kdward.
. Mrs. Mart* I. a (Jausrhter of Mrs. Pirrry,

thing chf desired. He got very excited

The witness said Mrs. Pierey's surround
ings wcro very poor and she did not fare
well. Edward would bring prepared food
from a delicatessen store and have it
â¢warmed over. In the five davs Miss
Epeneer acted as nurse, she paid. Edward
had supplied six bottles of whisky for his
mother's use. which the witness was in

with \%atÂ«r. On one occasion Edward had
abused the witness for allowing a little
girl to visit !::s mother.
"Isn't he bringing all these lawsuits

ehooi j-ou?"
Mr-5. Piercy would answer that such was

Governor Taft was questioned further
tc-day concerning slavery in the Philip
pines by members of the House Insular
Committee. The commission had under
taken no legislation as to slavery, he
paid, and the action taken by the military
has bten, first, to release Christian
Biaves. and second, to prevent slave-raid
ing: parlies from capturing slaves. Be
sides this constant moral Influence
was being exerted toward the eradication
of the system. The Governor said polyg

men. S
As to the proposed new coinage law,
Governor Taft .said that If there were
differences on theories of coinage the com
mission did not want this to delay the
other essential features of legislation for
the islands. The coinage measure in
volved the maintenance of the gold stand
ard, which he believed could be done. He
thought the adoption of the American
financial system in the islands would be
diejistrous by bringing about sudden
changes. The Governor favored three
Philippine delegates to Congress, repre
senting the three great tribes or elements
of the Philippines. The committee agreed
to close the extended hearings to-morrow

While receiving the apostolic benedic

After four years of almost continuous
fighting, the -Federal Salt Company,
otherwise the salt trust, has won practi
cal possession and control of the valuable
salt marshes owned by Mrs. Mary Peter
mann of Mount Kden. '
Moves which were made a short time
ago place the salt trust In the position of
control after a seesaw contest which vra*
made by William J. Dlngee and others to
tight the trust control ot the aalt output.
The Mount Eden marshea were the key to
the situation because of the large quan
tity of the gallno product that la handled
there. That Industry I? one of the most
important in Alameda County.
The contest for possession runs back to
lsas, when the salt trust bogan to aecuro
the salt marshes of the country. AKÂ«nt*
bought up by leano the output of nil th*
holdings in Alameda County except Mrs.
I'ctermunn's. They tlnnlly secured her
. signature to a leu*Â« nt $323 u year, a fltturo
that whs subsequently Â«Uu:limÂ«d to be en
tirely too small. Henry 1'etermnnn, u son,
begun u content to hnv* hlÂ» mother do
clurrd incompetent ami succeodcil in hav
ing it i;uiin!i;iu uppointcd and thin leano
wbk revoked.
But tho suit company needed the prop
erty and after negotiations consented to
pay $1500 a year for tho lease. Mrs. Peter
mann was restored to capacity and thla
leano was signed. During the warring be
tween members of tho Petcrmann family
over the salt trust lease IMngeo came
upon the scene.
There was a mortgage of $10,000 on tna
property, held by F. C. Slcbe of San Fran
cisco. Control of that mortgage would be
a valuable Item In the control of the salt
output. Very quietly an assignment of
the mortgage was made by Siebe to A. E.
H. Cramer, cashier of tho Union Savings
Bank, who, it is asserted, acted as trus
tee for, Dlngee, who had begun hla tight
to become a rival to the salt trust.
Back and forth the contest had ru.i
i during the negotiations that had been
opened to force the salt trust to pay a
mora liberal figure for its lease. Mrs.
Petermann was declared incompetent a
second time and again restored to capa
city after the final settlement of the
lease. That was arranged to* date from
September, 1899, and to run five years.
The trust, however, was not satisfied
that the mortgage should be in the hand3
of a possible rival, so negotiations were
begun to secure the collateral. There Is
now under way the search and confirma
tion of title; preliminary to the transfer
to the trust of the mortgage, which, it i3
understood, the combine will take up and
; liquidate.
The mortgage, plus interest, amounts to
nearly $11,000. Some of those who have
been Interested in the property assert It
is worth J19.000. As matters stand now
those concerned look for an early transfer
of the control to the trust.
, The President is understood to have
made his position quite clear, and in no
doing la Baid to have removed several
misapprehensions! which have been afloat
of late. He expressed the most earnest
solicitude that a satisfactory adjustment
be reached by Congress. Furthermore,
the President, It is asserted, indicated no
positive determination in favor of any
particular idea, but rather a desire that
Congress should deal with the subject ac
cording to its best lights. After hearing
from Tawney his associates expressed the
belief that the President would accept the
rebate proposition if Congress sent it to
him. They also were considerably en
couraged to hear from Tawney that the
President was not laying down any em
phatic ultimatum in favor of the plan
presented by Payne.
Postmaster General Payne said to-night
that the conference at the White House
was perfectly harmonious and agreeable.
He said it was brought about by the re
port that the President would to-day send
a message to Congress expressing his
views on the subject. The President, he
said, in order to get a clear Idea of the
situation, wanted to hear both sides of
the case and ascertain the real feeling of
the Republican members of the House.
The President has no intention at this
time, he said, of sending any message to
Congress on the subject.
Active canvassing continued among Re
publican members to-day preliminary to
tha&third caucus on Cuban reciprocity, to
b'oTield to-morrow night. The most posi
tive claims were made by those opposed
to Representative Payne's 20 per cent
reciprocity plan that there waa a clear
majority acrulnst It. Fayno and his tisao
r'.uu-s old not concede this, however, and
expressed thu belief that u concession to
Cuba ultimately would bo arranted. It was
Htild in this connection that Speaker Hen-
Uerfeon is now fuvornblo to tha position
taken by the majority on the WayÂ» and
Metiiur. Committee -niid tljftt thi* would
exert much Influence In siuipinK^fhe out

During the day several members of the
Cabinet were culled on hyiTttwney and
MoitIm, who have p'ropbitltlona differing
from that of 1'ayne. As an outcome of
these culls It waa inserted that three
member* of the Cabinet, namely. 1'ont
muuter Oenerul Payne, Secretary Bhaw
and Secretary' Wllaon, were hopeful of
Hfcclng a Bolutlon of the problem which
would not endanger an American in*
dustry.
Later In the day Representative Taw
ney called at the White House and had
a conference lasting nearly an hour and

ciates who are opposed to the Payne reso

A CAUSE OF HEADACHE
One Very Common Cause, Generally
Overlooked.
Headache Ij a symptom, an indication of de-
rangement or disease In some organ, and thÂ»
cause of the headache Is difficult to locate be-
cauae so many diseases have headache aa a
prominent symptom; derangement of tha
stomach and liver, heart trouble, kidney .dis-
ease, luns trouble, eye utraln or tll-flttlng
> glasses all produce headaches, and If we could
I always locate the organ which Is at fault tho
cure of obstinate headaches would be a much
i simpler matter.
However, for that form of headache called
frontal headache, pain back of the eyes and In
; forehead, the cause Is now known to be catarrh
of the head and throat; when the headache is
located in back of head and neck it is often
caused from catarrh of the stomach or liver.
At any rats catarrh Is the most common
cause of such headaches and tho cure of thÂ«
catarrh causes a prompt disappearance of tha
headaches.
There Is at present no treatment for catarrh
no convenient and effective as Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, a new internal remedy in tablet form,
composed of antiseptics like Â«ucalyptor. mal-
â¢ col and blooil root, which act upon the blood
end cause the elimination of tha catarrhal pol-
Bon from the system through the natural chan-
nels.
Miss Cora Alnsley, a prominent school
teacher In one of our normal schools, speaks of
her experience with catarrhal headaches and
eulogizes Stuart's Catarrh Tablets as a cut*
for them. She says: "I suffered dally from
severe frontal headache and pain In and back
of the eyes, at 'times so Intensely aa to Inca-
pacitate me In my daily dutlea. I had suffered
from catarrh, more or less, for years, but nÂ«ver
thought it was the cause of my headaches, but
finally became convinced that such was th*
case, because the headaches were always worse
whenever I had a cold or tresh attack of ca-
"Stuart's Catarrh were highly ' rec-
ommended tome as a aafo and pleasant catarrh
cure, and after using a few flfty-cent boxM Â¦
which I procured from my druggist, 1 waa sur-
prised and delighted to nnd that both the ca-
tarrh and headaches had gone for good."
. Stuart's Catarrh Tablet9 are sold by drug-
gists at fifty centa per package, under th*
guarantee ot the proprietors that they contain
absolutely no cocaine (found In so many catarrh
cures'), no opium (so common In cheap cough
cures), nor any harmful drug. Chey contain
simply the wholesome antiseptics necessary to
destroy and drive from the system the germs
of catarrhal disease.

February 15 and was fairly well treated
by wind and weather until February, 24,
wh-2n a roaring gale came along from the
west-southwest. This gale continued for
forty hours, the bark scudding before it
under lower topsails. .The decks were
filled with water to the rails throughout
the etorm and some big seas broke com
pletely over the vessel. One. wave, which
came over the port quarter, tore the bin
nacle from the deck and did a lot of other
damage. There was another big gale on
March 1, which lasted eighteen hours, and
was followed by thirty-one hours of al
most dead calm.. The Flint brought a
cargo of sugar.

Discussion on tho Sub
sidy Question Will
SHIPPIIIG BILL
NEARS THE VOTE
The officer of the deck knew nothing
whatever of the agreement made between
Captain Fleet of the Phaeton and the tug
captain, "but the latter kept it deep down
in his pocket and said nothing."
Before the Phaeton sailed an investiga
tion was held and the preponderance of
evidence of. the officers of the British
cruiser was against the. captain of the
little American tug. Brokaw wanted to
be paid for the damages and he let them
do tho talking, still having Captain
Fleet's agreement in his pocket. When
he thought he had been abused and
blamed long enough he surprised the ofll
cers of his Majesty's cruiser by springing
upon them the agreement made with their
captain. Silence reigned supreme.
The end of the story is that Captain
Fleet paid twenty pounds sterling, with a
request that the incident be regarded as
closed and also as an international secret.
The officer of the deck on the Phaeton
seemed to be out oÂ£ sorts while the water
ing of the British ship wa* in progress
and after the accident happened used
some strong language, stigmatizing Can
tain Brokaw as a "d Yankee."
With this guarantee Captain Brokaw
got his tug alongside after much diffi
culty. When compelled to back his boat,
however, a wave swept the tug against
the boom and tilted her foremast forward
so that it had to be cut oft. The weather
had been very rough for several days and
there was a strong southerly swell break
ing over the harbor.
HONOLULU, Feb. 26.â The accident
that occurred to the tug Fearless when
supplying the British cruiser Phaeton
with coal has nearly, resulted in an Inter
national question. The Phaeton arrived
In Honolulu February 17 after a fruitless
search for the missing Condor; On Feb
ruary 21 she was supplied with water by
the Fearless. Before beginning his work
Captain Brokaw of the tug fouiyl con
siderable difficulty in getting hia boat
safely; alongside, owing to projecting
guns and turrets, and the long, boom to
which the warship's boats were made
fast. He then saw Captain Fleet of the
Phaeton and made an arrangement with
him that the Britisher would be respon
sible if any damage occurred.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
After the meeting adjourned the four
School Directors and Superintendent
Webster called upon Mayor Schmitz to
protest against the action of the Board
of Works in refusing to allow its subor
dinates to confer with the Board of Ed
ucation in the matter of school repairs.
Director Woodward explained that the
J><5ard of Works insisted on doing all the
work and buying the materials without
couaulllng the Directors or filing requisi
tions for the same. After> the work was
completed the requisitions and bills were
sent in and were rarely correctly certified.
The Directors asked the Mayor to aid in
adjusting the differences, and his Honor
promised to do so.
Superintendent Webster announced that
he was not ready to report on the charges
of unprofessional conduct and violation
of the rules in inflicting unusual punish
ment on pupil Ragglo against -Principal
M. E. Blanchard. Webster said that new
evidence against the accused teacher had
come before him and he desired further
time to formulate his report. It is now
believed beyond a doubt that BlancharJ
Â¦will have to stand trial before the Board
of Education.
C. F. Weber was 'awarded the contract
to install a gymnasium apparatus on the
children's playground for $S*>3 20.
New Evidence Against Blanchard.
Director Woodward asked if the Board
of Public Works had replied to the reso
lution adopted by the School Board pro
testing against the extravagance In school
repairs made by the first named board.
AVhen Woodward was informed that the
Hoard of Works .had paid no attention io
the resolution he promptly ordered the
bills for school repairs to be held up.
William I.. Brown was appointed as
tlstant teacher of mathematics, mechan
ical drawing and surveying in the Poly
technic High School, subject to the pro
bationary period of two years.
Miss Emily Kalishcr was granted a six
months' leave of absence, provided she
waived her x rlght to return to any particu
lar class, and upon her return that she
be placed on the evening substitute list
under date of her appointment.
A resolution was adopted authorizing
the formation of two classes In the Ouena
Vista School and one in tho Bernal
School. ' .
On the recommendation of the' principal
of.thft Humboldt Evening School W. P.
lilake was appointed a substitute during
thf> leave of F. H. Dam.
Forms Three New' Classes.
The board proposes to order the draw
ing up of plans in the near future for a
modern structure to accommodate the pu
pils who desire to attend the Commercial
School.
The board adopted a resolution granting
the request of Superintendent Webster
that hÂ« be authorized to present sugges
tions for amendments to the schedule of
work in the present course of study and
submit them to the board' on or before
April 8, 1902, to be then taken under ad
visement by the board. Webster says hU
recommendations will be made after con
sulting with the teachers in the depart
ment, and that he will ask for a modifica
tion of the course.
Tho name of the grammar school known
as the Longfellow .School was restored to
Kincon Grammar School.
"Mr. Denraan has personal and politi
cal reasons for opposing Â¦ me. He has
never visited my scnool, so far as I know,
though it is his otllciiil duty to do so,
and therefore he is not in a position to
judge of the character of my work. Both
of the universities have approved my
work and admitted my pupils without ex- t
animation. They are perhaps as compe
tent to judge of my efficiency as Mr. Den
man. I am neither surprised nor cha
grined by Denman's opposition."
The Board of Education met yesterday
and took the preliminary steps toward
placing commercial instruction on an in
dependent basis in the School Depart
ment. A resolution was adopted order-
Ing the segregation of tho commercial de
partment of the Llncqln Grammar School
and directing its establishment in a dis
tinct nnd separate school, to be desig
nated as the "Public Commercial School."
Pending the preparation of new quarters
tl;e school will continue In the Lincoln
School building.
C. H. Murphy, at present the head of
the department, was appointed principal
of the Commercial School at a salary of
J1SC per mouth. The resolution further
directs Superintendent \Vebster and Prin
cipal Murphy to prepare a course of study
for the school, which Is to be submitted
before March 26, 1902. Denman was the
only Director who voted against the reso
lution, giving as his reason that the prop
osition was too weighty to take hasty ac
tion upon. Denman said he did not think
Murphy competent to organize a commer
cial school In a city of 400,000 Inhabitants.
Mr. Murphy in an interview after tho
meeting said: / '

som street. Brown was drinking In the
saloon of M. J. Healy, 301 Sixth, Btreet
and left the place at. 3 o'clock yesterday
morning to go to his room. Shortly after
5 o'clock- H. Partmann, the landlord,
heard the crackling oÂ£ nrc and, opening
the door of Brown's room, saw the mid
dle of the carpet in flames. He ran and
got a bucket of water, but when he re
turned he found that the fire had made
too much headway and he hurried to the
nearest fire engine house, at 311 Sixth
street, and gave the alarm.
After the flames had been extinguished
James Conniff; captain of chemical en
gine company No. 6, found Brown's body
in the ruins. Near it lay a coal-oil lamp;
The supposition Is that Brown accidental
ly upset the lamp.

I have discovered that some circulars in
vogue are made . up of statements purporting
to have been made by the State Mineralogist
of California, -when, as a matter of fact, they
had no such origin. I have discovered com
panies that refuse to let any of their literature
get ' out of their hands unless they are very
sure who will receive it. which I consider to
be a suspicious circumstance. I will see that
any company that is found to be crooked shall
have Its share of free advertising.
I do not see any better way to reach these
companies and possibly other than through
the medium of publicity. That I am willing
to provide when all the facts are ln. Prose
cutions are slow and uncertain. Upon a show-
Ins that the companies are deceiving the pub
lic the Postal Department of the United States
will probably see that their literature is ex
cluded In the future from the malls.
The State Mineralogist has found out
that one company that Is advertising
through pamphlets and also through the
Eastern newspapers to be paying divi
dends at the rate of 24 per cent per an
num is not operating its mine and has not
been working it for at least one year. An
other company that has several mines
which" it advertises is working only one
of its properties. Still another company
is selling stock upon the basis of a min3S
which It does not own, but has only un
der bond. In talking of the matter yes

State Mineralogist Aubury says that his
Investigations concerning mining compa
nies in this State that are advertising to
pay huge dividends are. bearing fruit. He
has received preliminary reports from an
expert who is out in the ffcld. At this
time he declines to give out the names
of the companies under investigation, as
he has not all the facts concerning them,
and he does not wish to work any possi
ble injustice. He says he will give out all
the facts as soon as possible, that are
needed to warn the public against com

MINING FRAUDS
TO BE EXPOSED
"Now. here Is a suggestion I have to
offer which, if carried out, will make Red
ding a second Butte City," added Proc
tor. "Let your people secure the big level
tract of land across the river from Red
ding, near the Reid ferry, where our road
passes, as the site for a great combina
tion copper smelter, whither all the cop
per mines of the county can send their
ore to be smelted. Neither Bully Hill,
Kennet, the Balaklala nor others of the
great mines have enough level ground for
the smelting capacity they need. I be
lieve the owners can all be induced to
agree upon one combination smelter on
this broad . tract. Of course, the fumes
would affect your rosebuds In town, but
it would make Redding a great business
center."
"We cannot do otherwise," said Proc
tor. "If we build down into town we
must cross Sacramento River, where it
is much wider and go back up the stream
again...
Redding citizens were surprised at,Proc
tor's announcement to-day that the road
will not run through Redding. 'It will
cross the river at the northern city Iimit3,
a. mile from the business center.
"From Eureka to Redding the route Is
ICO miles long. The railroad will pass six
miles south of Weaverville, owing to 'the
rough country. A branch will be buiSt
to Weavervilie. Trinity Mountain is 'to
be crossed at Shasta divide. The. road
Cpmes by the Tower House and the town
of Shasta, passing two miles south of
Keswick." â¢
"The great advantage which the road
will possess over all others is that it is
an ideal winter route," said Proctor. "The
very highest elevation which we reach is
5000 feet. There is almost no snow along
the route, and we will not have to build
a single rod of pnowsheds. We will cross
the mountains at Hatchet Creek Pass,
th^ lowest in the Sierra Nevadas. No
more than five feet of enow has been
known in this pass in the hardest winter.
It was discovered by Union Pacific.sur
veyors several years ago. A survey which
they made through Burney and P"aJl
River valleys, crossing the pass. Is adopt
ed in toto.
Proctor estimates that nearly all of tbe
$25,000,000 provided will be required in
building the 800 miles of road. The first
consideration has been to get the most
direct route for an eastern road to' the
coast. From Eureka it will come in as
direct a line Â«as possible and from here
to "VVeiser, on the Idaho and Oregon bor
der, it will run northeast in an . almost
straight line.
REDDING, March 5.â Lord Thurlow
and George H. Proctor this afternoon

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Commissioner Qhnimus said yesterday
that as the rumor came to him. the fund
was raised among a large number of of
ficers, including corporals, sergeants and
lieutenants, as well J as patrolmen, and
promotion was to be assured to '. each.
Ohnimus 'says that he and the Mayor
concluded - that the rumor was entirely
groundless and dropped their inquiry two
weeks ago.
Commissioner Ohnimus denies the state
ment attributed' to him that a. patrolmau
went, to him and, said that a corruption
fund had been raised. He says that what
he did say was that when he heard the
rumor; he went to a patrolman whom he
could trust and that officer told him he
also had heard the rumor. Ohnimus put
him to work on it, but he reported later
that he could find nothing more than
vague rumor. Ohnimus refuses to give
the name of the patrolman. Chief of Po
lice Wlttman and Secretary Moran will
probably,~demand that the name be made
public and that the patrolman be put on
the witness stand in an investigation by
the Mayor, to tell how the 'rumor reached
him. :
. Secretary. Moran and the Commission
ers were busy yesterday afternoon seek
ing an interview with the Mayor, but his
Honor was called away from his office
soon after noon and did not return. AH
of the Commissioners had expected to see
the Mayor at 4 o'clock, Moran having
made a provisional appointment for that
hour through the Mayor's secretary.
' The Civil Service Commission at a
meeting yesterday afternoon voted to
send letters' to Mayor Schmitz and the
Grand Jury asking investigations of the
rumor that has gotten into print that a
corruption fund of JGOOO was raised by
sixty patrolmen to insure their promotion
to corporalships.'. As Mayor Schmitz has
said that if an should be
asked it would be held,- doubtless the of
ficial inquiry will be forthcoming.

It is known that Macarthur's proposal
followed upon the heels of a conference
A\ith Henry T. Scott, president of the
Union Iron Works, in which Scott gave
the labor - leader assurances that he
needed skilled mechanics and that as rap-
Idly as possible his former employes
would be reinstated if the strike was de
clared 4 off.. Whether or not Scott also
gaye, his promise that he would be will-
Ing to let the arbitration committee of
the National Civic Federation decide the
merits of the controversy between the
Union Iron Works and the strikers is one
of the secrets of the conference. But
Business Agent Wisler and other promi
nent members of the union took part Jn
the discussion, which for the most part
was calm, and dispassionate. Supervisor
Wynn was present, but did not take part
in. the discussion. The men gave up with
some reluctance the struggle in which
they have stood shoulder to shoulder for
ten months, but when the result of the
secret ballot was known the majority was
found to be In favor of trusting its inter
ests to .tho half promise of arbitration
that is held out to It.

i Macarthur told the assembled strikers
that upon his return from the East with
his credentials as a member of the arbi
tration committee of the National Civic
Federation and fresh from conferences
with the noted men who make up that
body and with the labor leaders of the
East, he .had discussed with the, local
loaders the plan which had been accepted
6y tlje Iron Trades Council and sent to
them for their approval. ' â,Â«.
1 He felt sure that the local employers
would not ignore the recommendations
of the National Civic Federation and they
had much to hope for from such method
/of consideration of their demands. He
urged upon them that unless they felt
confident that heir present line of action
would result ln victory within a reason
able time, it were the part of wisdom to
accept the- good offices of the men of na
tional reputation who have lately inter
ested themselves in the effort to adjust
labor difficulties.

The meeting of machinists was . a.
lengthy one. Walter Macarthur addressed
the assembled worklngmen, explaining in
great detail the plan under which the men
were advised to declare the strike Qi'f.
He told them that he had the assurance
of Senator Hanna, chairman of the arbi
tration committee of the National Civic
Federation, that the relations of em
ployers and employes in the great ship
building plants of the country where war
ships are builtâ Cramps, Newport News
and the Union Iron Worksâ would be
The unions were in session until long
af tei midnight arranging plans by which
their application for work under old terms
this morning will be orderly and seem
ly and not the scramble of hundreds of
eager Individuals without organization.
They will appear at the various iron
works and factories at, the hour for be
ginning work and each man will apply it
possible to his former foreman, if not to
the foreman in charge of his particular
branch of work and will state that he
is at liberty to resume work.
"Where men are needed the old employes
will be reinstated without question. Many
will not get work at once. In fact, itis
doubtful if even the majority of them
will find work ready at hand, but they
believe and many of the employers agree
with them that in the course of a few
weeks much the larger portion of them
will be employed under the conditions
that existed prior to May 20 of last year.
Shipbuilding ; Plants to Determine
This' action, together with the favor
able action of practically all the other
unions involved in the great iron trades
strike in San Francisco, means the end
ing of the strike and the return to work
as fast as conditions will permit of the
skilled mechanics who for ten months
have walked the streets in idleness. ;
SAN FRANCISCO Lodge of Inter
national Association of Machinists
No. 6S decided last night by secret
ballot to accept the proposition rec
ommended to It by the Iron Trades
Council to declare the strike off and to
permit members to apply to their former
employers for work under the old condi
tions, with the hope held out to them by
Walter Macarthur, the well-known labor
leader and Pacific Coast representative
on the arbitration committee of the Na
tional Civic Federation/that within six
months the Questions at issue between
them and the employers will be submitted
to arbitration.
All of the larger concerns remained
equally stubborn against granting the
terms asked by the strikers, and only a
small percentage of the men obtained em
ployment in the smaller shops which
agreed to the conditions laid down by
the union. Despite this enforced idleness,
there were no cases of defection from the
strikers' ranks, and through* all the long
months there was an entire absence of
disorder, or unlawful interference with the
rights of others on the part of the ma
chinists.
v After the meeting R. I. Wlsler, business
aÂ£ent of the Machinists' Union, said that
the strike had been one of the longest
and most persistent ever carried on in
the United States. He claimed that out
of all the men who went out nine and a
half months ago not more than sixty de
serted and went back to work without
the leave of their union. He said that
about 2700 men remained out. to the last
and that about that number would apply
for work this morning.
On May 20, 1901, every member of the
Iron Trades Council in San Francisco,
consisting of the International Brother
hood of Boilermakers and Iron Ship
Builders, International Brotherhood of
Blacksmiths, International Association of
Machinists, and the coremakers, metal
polishers, buffers, platers and brass
workers, numbering over 4000 men, packed
up their tools and left their various places
of employment in consonance with a de
mand formulated by the national organ
ization for a nine-hour working day.
For nearly ten months the men have
remained on strike, and at all times have
presented an unbroken front to their for
mer employers. They have never modi
fled their demands during this period of
idleness, and have shown- no signs of
surrender. * In this steadfastness the
strike of the ironworkers has been with
out a parallel.

geott would not be indifferent to the rec
ommendations of that body.
Nearly all of the unions affiliated with
the Iron Trades Council voted at meet
ings j^uesday. night to accept the recom
mendation of the council to declare the
strike off. The machinists had taken the
matter under consideration, adjourning till
last night. The decision reached by the
men ol the other | unions had its effect
Â£,Â« ?Â« machinists, Â¦ comprising the mo*5t
influential body in the iron trades, settled
beyond any doubtrthe fate of the strike.
_ Boilermakers arftl Iron Ship Builders'
Union No. 25 was the single organization
to hold out against the strike. Of its
membership but sixty men are at pres-

will fall In line, now. that the question of

Macarthur the Iron Trades Council held
a. meeting and formally recommended to
