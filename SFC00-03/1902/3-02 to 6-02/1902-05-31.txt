Admiral Servan reports that one of the
submarine cables was broken May 3 at
an unknown distance north of Martinique.
This break was followed by the first erup
tion of ashes. The second cable was
broken May 5 at a point. ten miles west
of St. Pierre. In 130 fathoms of water, and
when It was dredged up It was found to
be tangled and twisted. The night of
May 5 there occurred the eruption of mud
.which overwhelmed the Guerla factory.
Wdmlral Servan considers that these facts
indicate the possibility of submarine fls-
Admiral Servan accepted Professor
Hill's present theoretic attitude of thÂ«
subject of the eruption and praised his
judgment in not arriving at a hypothesis
until he had studied the data he has col
lected. Professor Hill told the admiral
that his study of data should be finished
on the spot. He said Mont Pelee might
erupt for a year or more, but that tha
area of devastation would remain un
changed. As all the people had fled from
the Vicinity of the volcano, no great loss
of life would occur. Professor Hill said
Fort de France was perfectly safe.
FORT DE FRANCE SAFE.
The commander of the French cruiser
D'Assas was presented to Admiral Servan
in tho course of the latter's Interview
with Professor. Hill. .The commander of
the D'Assas had just returned fronV'a
tour, of Inspection and reported that at
14 o'clock last night he saw incandescent
matter slowly flowing over the rim of
the crater at the summit. This report
has not yet been confirmed. â¢
Last night Admiral Servan invited Pro
fessor Robert T. Hill, the United States
Government geologist, on the French
cruiser Tage, Admiral Servan's flagship,
and had an Interview with him on hl3 re
cent expedition to Mont Pelee. United
States Consul Aymee acted as interpreter
at the interview, which lasted three hours.
Admiral Servan was deepiy interested in
what Professor Hill had to say, as he has
personal theories concerning the recent
eruptions. The admiral furnished Pro
â¢fessor Hill with many observations mads
b,y the French naval officers under him.
and highly complimented Professor Hill
and the 'National Geographical Society
upon their explorations.

HONOLULU, May 24â Interest in the
price of meat has been aroused /in .the
Territory of Hawaii, owing to the striking
advance recently made on- the mainland.
For many, years it has been customary
for Honolulu to obtain a large part of its
meat | supply from j the Pacific Coast, as
meny; as; 300, carcasses of beef and 1000 of
sheep coming; down In the refrigerating
chambers â¢ of each regular steamer. At
the present time harmy any. meat Is ob
tained from the mainland. ' \
Supplies on , these islands have been
gradually increasing and there is now sut
rtcient stock on the, hoof in sight to feed
the total population' for more than four
months to come.'.* It is hoped that the sup
ply has not ceased, but that Hawaii has
at last I become independent . of the main
land for its- prtneipar staple' food.
. Comparing the .wholesale and retail
prices. of meat this year in Honolulu with
u year ago, there has. been an advance of
a cent: and a half per pound in the whole
sale price for dressed Deef; of half a cent
a . pound, for dressed mutton and of one
cent. -a pound for veal. Retail prices show
an, advance of two cents for sirloin
steaks, of five cents: for porterhouse and
of; two; and a half cents, tor round steak.
Mutton at retail is practically unchanged
and the same may be said of veal, while
perk has advanced two cents a pound at
retail.,,:. - . ,,-â¢....Â¦ â¢ â¢"-.:
'A familiar figure In Rotten row, the old
bark Sebastian Bach, startled the water
front folk this morning by going to Davy
Jones' locker. She had long since been
condemned' and was gradually being torn
to, pieces for old Junk and fire wood. Half
a dozen .'Japanese were aboard the vessel
getting; fire: wood in the morning. Be
tween decks were two white men, Charles
* lsher and John Ross, who began to put
the Twilight's lumber cargo on board the
Alice Kimball, which lay on her starboard
side. -The men narrowly -escaped.

Through a fund contributed by merchants
and business men Honolulu all -the
white people there each t receives $5 a

wishes that something of the kind could
be done for the Hawaiian patients. - Â¦

Acting Governor Cooper . has received
from Washington an inquiry regarding
one: Algernon Shaw, who disappeared
from Honolulu in August,. 1899. His dis
appearance was most mysterious. He
was an artist and was well known here.
His disappearance occurred on the after
noon " of the departure of the transport-
Ohio .for the Philippines, and it was
thought that he had gone on her, but it
has been found Impossible to trace him.
His parents in New Jersey have been
sending, letters of. inquiry- to all- possible
sources here for two years without re
sult, and have now applied to the authori
ses to assist in the search.
BRUSSELS. May 3O.-It Is said here
that the Boer delegates in Europe now
admit that peace in South Africa jhas
been secured and that the settlement be*
tween the Boers and Great Britain will
'be signed in the names of the former
citizens of the two South African
republics who are now in Europe, includ
ing: Kruger*. thus preventing the irrecon
cilables from continuing a guerrilla war
fare on the pretext that they are obey
ing the orders of the Boer delegates in
Europe.
PILrrERMARITZBURG, Natal, May 30.
Addressing a crowd at Greytown to-day,
the Governor-of Natal. Colonel Sir Henry
tid-R-ard McCailum, said the 2W Boer dele
gat* s at Vereeniging appeared to be hav
ing a. good time at the British expense.
They .were being treated, the Governor
oeclarcd. with the best of everything ob
tainable, hence arose the delay in an
nouncing a decision.
LONDON, May 20.â In connection with
the resignation of Dr. J. \V. Smart, Com
missioner of Public Works, from the
Cape Colony Cabinet, which was an
nounced from Cape Town yesterday, an
interesting sidelight of the difficulties
likely 10 confront the British administra
tors of South Africa after the conclusion
of peace is furnished by an article which
will be published in to-morrow's Empire
Review, the editor of which claims to
have exceptional sources of information.
The wilier of the article points out that
Cape Coicny will present a most serious
problem after the close of hostilities. The
province, which is nominally self-govern
ing, is now deprived of a constitution, is
urder military law and is honeycombed
with disloyalty from end to end. The au
thor of the article declares further that
if an attempt is made to restore the con
stitution the Afrlkanderbund will surely
dominate the political situation and that
campaign speeches will fan the existing
race hatred to a worse state than before
or during the war. The only safety for
the whole of South Africa, according to
the Review, lies in smothering the last
spark of sedition and in transforming the
Cap .t l Pw a crown colony and governing it
on tna. basis for several years to come.
Speaking at Leeds to-night Lord Rose
bei-y advised the leaders of the Liberal
pcrty j to postpone the announcement of
the programmes until there was some Im
meoiate prospect of getting them carried
out. Lord Rosebery said the first and
greatest question before the public was
p?ace. which he believed would be an
nounced in a few days. He said he hoped
aiat all might be able 1 to support the
Government's policy of pacification, but
warned his hearers that the Ministry was
not concluding peace with a crushed foe.
to v. horn no further attention need be
paid. The speaker said he hoped the
Oovernment would be wise enough to
adopt a generous policy and convert brave
foes into brave friends. This certainly
could not be done, said Lord Rosebery. on
the lines heretofore sketched by Lord
Salisbury, th" Premier, who said: "A
resolute Government might be required
for generations."
Referring to the present financial policy
of the Government. Lord Rosebery said
he thought the tax, on corn was a prelude
to a sort of zollverein throughout the em
pire. He said he could not summarilv dis
miss any proposal for the closer union of
the British empire, but the advantage
must be <Jemcnstrably great to justify
such a departure as a zollverein would
necessitate, and that this departure would
moan giving up the control of Great
Britain's financial system to the British
colonies. . .
Thf> -Government has not yet received
the decision from the Boer conference at
Vereeniglng, Transvaal, which was ex
pected to-day and which was to enable
Balfortr. the Government leader, to make
his statement concerning peace next Mon
day A dispatch received from Pretoria
says the British columns in South Africa,
especially the cavalry, have been greatly
benefited by their long rest. Lord Kitch
ener will again take the field if there is
any delay in the acceptance of Great
Britain's terms by the Boers. In the
meantime preparations are being made
for the repatriation of the Boers on the
termination of hostilities.

.Such letters as the following must surely convey conviction to the hearts ,
of all women that the great claims that Mrs. Pinkham makes for her medicine .
must be based upon positive evidence. â¢ . ' - ,- % j
Is it reasonable, think you, that we could hire such women as Miss How-
ard to speak well of JLydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound just
, for commercial reasons ? Impossible ! and it is an insult both to her and to
Mrs. Pinkham to suggest such an idea ; therefore, let every, woman read this
letter and believe, for it is as genuine in every particular as the eyes with
which you read these words* * C
Mrs. Pinkham invites all women who are ill to write her for
advice. Address Lynn, Mass., giving full particulars.
MISS Â¦ LAURA HOTV^ARD. r^.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkiiam : ; â I can thank you for perfect health to-day,
and gladly do I acknowledge it. life looked so dark to meayearor
two ago. I had constant pains, my limbs swelled, I had dizzy spells, and
never knew one day how I would feel the next. I^was nervous and had
no appetite, neither could I sleep soundly nigh*ts. Eight hottles of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, used in conjunction with
your Sanative Wash, did more for me than all the medicines and the
skill of the doctors. For eight months I have enjoyed perfect health.
I verily believe that most of the doctors are guessing and experimenting
when they try to cure a woman with an assortment of complications,
such as mine ; but you did not guess when you mixed your Compound ;
you evidently know whatyou are giving suffering women and are sure, of
what it will do. How i. wish all suffering women could only know of your \
remedy; there would, be less suffering and. many thousands more happy
and healthy women in America." â ItAUBA Howard, 113 Kewberry Ave-

O, my sisters, I do pray you to profit by Miss Howard's experi-
ences ; i ust as surely as she was cured of the troubles enumerated
in her letter, just so surely will Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound cure every woman in the land who suffers from womb
troubles, inflammation of the ovaries, kidne y troubles, nervous
excitability, and nervous prostration ; remember that it is Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound that is curing -women, and
don't allow any druggist to sell you anything else in its place.

They have shown themselves not unworthy of
you and they are entitled to the support, of
all men who are proud of what you did.
These younger comrades of yours have fought
under terrible difficulties and have received
terrible provocation from- a very cruel and very
treacherous enemy. Under the ; strain of these
provocations I deeply deplore to cay that some
among them have so far forgotten themselves
re to counsel and commit,' in retaliation, acts of
cruelty. The fact that lor every guilty act
committed by ene o* our Â¦ troops'' a hundred
acts of far greater atrocity -. have , been com
mitted by the hostile natives upon our troops,
or upon the peaceable and law-abiding natives
Â¦who are friendly to us. cannot be. held to ex
cuse any wrongdoer on our side. Determined
ati4 unswerving effort must be made, and is
being made, to find out every instance of bar*
tarity. on the part of our troops, to punish
, those .guilty of it. and to take. If possible,
even stronger measures than have already been
taken to minimize or prevent the occurrence
of all euch Instances In the future.
Is It only in the Army of the Philippines
that Americans sometimes do acts that cause
the reet of Americans regret?., (Cries of "Oh,
no!") From time to time there occur in our
country, to thÂ«? deep and lasting shame â¢ of
our people, lynehlngs carried on under circum
rtanoes of inhuman cruelty and barbadty â a
crueSty Infinitely worse than any that has ever
been committed by our troops Â¦ In the Philip
pines ; worse to the victims, and far man bru
talizing to those guilty of It. The men who
fall to condemn these lynchlngs, and . yet
clamor about what has been done in the
Philippines, are indeed guilty, of neglecting
the beam In their own eye while taunting their
brother about the mot* In his. Understand
me. These lynchlngs afford us no excuse for
failure to stop cruelty In the' Philippine*.
Ever}' effort is being made, and will be mad'
to minimize the chances of cruelty occurring.
But keep In mind that these cruelties In the
Philippines have been wholly exceptional, and
have been. ehame.lM'sljr exaggerated. We deeply
and bitterly regret that any such cruelties
should have been committed, no matter how
rarely, no matter under .what provocation, by
American troops. But tbey afford far less 'jus-'
tiflcation for a general condemnation of our
firmy than these lynchings afford for the con
demnation of the communities- in which ' they
have taken place. In each case It Is well to
Â«-onaemn the deed., and It is well Â¦ also to - re-'

In every community there are people who'
commit acts of well-nigh inconceivable horror

During our four generations of national life
we have had to do many tasks and some of
them of lar-reachlng importance, but the only
really vital task was the one you did â the task
of Eaving the Union. There were other crises
in which to have gone wrong would have
meant disaster, but this was the one crisis In
which to have gone wrong would have meant
not merely disaster but annihilation. For fail
ure at any other point atonement could have
been made: but had you failed in the Iron days
the loss would have been irreparable, the de
feat irretrievable. Upon your success depended
all the future of the people on this continent
and much of the future of mankind as a
Â¦whole.
Tou left us a reunited country. Tou left us
the right of brotherhood with the men In
irray, who with such courage and such devo
tion for what they deemed the right, fought
against you. But you left us much more even
than your achievement, for you left us the
memory of how it was achieved. You, . who
made good by your valor and patriotism, the
frtatesmanshlp of Lincoln and the soldiership
of Grant, have set as the standards for our
efforts in the future both the way you did your
work in war and the way In which when the
war was over you turned again to the work of
peace. In war and in peace alike your ex
ample will stand as the wisest of lessons to
us and our children and our children's cbil-

nations of mankind. Tou did the greatest

It is a good custom for our country to have
certain solemn- holidays in commemoration of
our greatest men and of the greatest crises In
our history. There should be but few such
holidays. To increase their number is to
cheapen , them. Washington and Lincoln â the
m.in who did most to found the Union and the
man who did most to preserve it â stand head
and shoulders above all our other public men.
and have by common consent won the right to

E. B. Hay read Lincoln's Gettysburg aa

as he arose he was again greeted with the
plaudits of the immense audience, which
stretched far outside the limits of the
amphitheater. During his address he was
frequently interrupted by . bursts of ap
plause. The President spoke as follows:

Memorial Day was ob

generally than . ever be
fore- The announcement
that President Roosevelt
would deliver the oration
at Arlington brought' to that historic city
of the dead a vast concourse of people.
The local arrangements. were in charge of
the Department of the Potomac, and in
cluded a parade of all the Grand Army of
the Republic and other patriotic organi
zations, the decoration of monuments and
graves and addresses by men prominent
in the affairs of the Government.
At Arlington a national salute was fired
at 12 o'clock by the Fourth Battery, Unit
ed States Field Artillery. Music was ren- ;
dered by the Marine Band and by the
Memorial Choir. Upon arriving at Arling
ton the procession marched to the tombs
of the unknown. During^the decoration
of tombs by the special committee chosen
from the Grand Army of the Republic
organizations and auxiliary societies, the
iiarine Band played an appropriate selec
tion. " Â¦
The procession then broke up and the
decoration of graves began. A touching
feature was the strewing of flowers over
the graves of the Confederate dead bur
ied in the cemetery. Meantime a va&t
crowd had assembled at the amphitheater,
where the services were conducted. The
familiar strains of "Nearer. My God, to
Thee" by the Marine Band marked the
beginning of the services. President

INSURGENT CBTJELTIES.
It behooves us to keep a vigilant watch to
prevept these abuses and to punish those who
commit them; but Ir because of them we
flinch from finishing the task on which we
nave entered we show ourselves cravens and
weaklings, unworthy of . the sires* from whose
loins we sprang. There were abuses and to
spare in the Civil- War. Your false friends
then. called Grant a "butcher", and. spoke of
you who are listening to me as mercenaries,
as Lincoln's hirelings." Your open foesâ
as in the resolution passed by the Confederate
Congress In October, 1862 â accused you at
great length and with much particularity of
contemptuous ydlsregard of the usages of civil
ized war* ; of, 'subjecting women and children
to banishment, imprisonment and death"; of
murder," of "rapine," of "outrages on wo
f '^Je" cruelty." of "perpetrating
atrocities which would be - disgraceful to sav
ages ; and Abraham Lincoln was singled out
for special attack because of 'his "spirit of
barbarous .ferocity." Verily these, men who
thus foully slandered you have their heirs to-

deeds of wrong jso keenly., that at last they

The rules Â¦ of warfare which have been; pro
mulgated by the War department and accepted
as the basis of conduct by our troops -In the
Held are the rules laid down by Abranam Lin
coln when you, my hearers, were lighting for
the Union. These rules provide, of course, for
the Just severity necessary in.war.'.Tne most
destructive \ of all forms of cruelty would be
to show weakness where sternness is demanded
by iron need. But all cruelty is forbidden,' and
ml harshness beyond what is called -for c by
need. Our enemies In .the Philippines have not
merely violated every rule of -war, but have
made of these violations their only method of
carrying on the war. We would have been
justified by Abraham Lincoln's rules of war in
infinitely greater severity than has been shown.
The fact really is that our warfare in the
Philippines has been carried on with singular
humanity. .For every act of cruelty by- our
men there have been innumerable acts of for
,bearance, magnanimity and generous kindness
These are the qualities -which have" character-'
ixed the war as a whole. The cruelties have
been wholly exceptional ! on our part - â¢
The guilty are to be punished; but In punish
ing them let. those who sit at ease at home,
who walk delicately and live in the soft places
or the earth, remember also to do them, com
mdn justice. Let not v . the effortless . and the
untempted rail overmuch at strong men who
with blood and sweat tace . years of toil and
days and nights of agony, and at need lay
down their lives in remote tropic jungles to
bring the light of civilization into the world's
Â£T k *. places - The warfare that has extended
the boundaries of civilization at the - expense
of barbarism and savagery has been for cen
turies one of the most potent Â¦ factors in the
progress of humanity. Yet from its very nature
It has always and everywhere been liable to
dark abwsÂ«8. .
SEVERITY IN WAIU
these individuals - and upon their acts, and if
we forget the far more numerous citizens of
upright and honest life and blind ourselves ! to
their countless deeds' of .wisdom . and Â¦ justice
and philanthropy, it is easy . enough to con
demn the cotamunity. There is not a. city in
this land which we â¢ could not thus condemn
it we fixed our eyes purely upon its , police
record and refused to look at what it had ac
complished for decency and Justice 'and char
ity. Tet this is exactly the attitude which has
been taken by too many* men with reference to
our army in- the Philippines; and "it is an at
titude both absurd and cruelly unjust.

The tanbark ring was laid in front/ of
the clubhouse, the spacious verandas' of
which furnished a coign of. vantage from
which the interesting competition could be |
viewed.. The ring was in the form of an |
overgrown "8." The two. -circles were
beds of green lawn, which made a pleas-
Ing contrast with the dull red of the tan- i
bark. A tastefully decorated stand on the
opposite side of the ring from the club
house provided an excellent viewpoint
for the people of the countryside. During
the afternoon there was a large attend
ance of spectators, who came in all man
ner of conveyances, from an Irish jaunt
ing car to a puffing automobile.
Competition was keen in man v of the
classes. The most, exciting was'that for
the best high-stepper in the show. Two
old rivals. Walter Hobart's horse Para
gon, driven by his owner, and George A.
Pope's Sweetheart, which have been com
peting against the other since 1893, were
again brought together. E. D. Beyland
and ,W, Mayo Newhall looked the" class
over long and critically. They were un
able to agree as to the disposition of the
blue ribbon and finally called F. S. Moody
to their assistance. Walter; Hobarf car
ried off the blue ribbon triumphantly and
also a silver cup, which went with it.

ever seen at a show here, although ' the

rowed down to a match between Walter

rode his once great horse Royalty, which
shows signs of his advancing i'ears. John
Lswson rode Vanity, a slashing big thor
oughbred, which raced over the'jumps in
the colors of Edward Corrigan some years
since. After being sent over the
small jumps the judges were unable 10
decide between the two horses, and Mr.
Lawson Suggested a high jump. The bar
was put at about five feet. On the third
attempt Loyalty cleared it. Vanity was
not so fortunate, knocking the bar down
Each lady received a blue ribbon. It
required no straining of gallantry on the

Everybody wanted a ticket on Al Sandy,
driven by James O'Kane and a sizzlln?
choice for the 2:20 class fixture. He paced
rings around his company In each heat,
with the trotter Cicero his closest attend
ant at each essay. Dolly Gray took third
money. Mutuels on the winner paid $2 80
in each heat.
CICERO . A CLOSE SECOND.
Some zigzag piloting on the part of J.
Doran lost the first heat of the 2:30 class
event for Dan Alden, the well-played sec
ond choice. After leading from the word
almost, Alden swerved under punishment
the last thirty yards, colliding with Vel
ma, driven by H. W. Miller. Although
Dan Alden won by a head j the Judges
could do nothing but award the r heat to
Velma. Reinsman Miller's bike" went
down after the finish, throwing him out,
and the pacer ran away a half-mile be
fore being caught. Mutuels on this heat
paid 19 35. Elchora Wilkes, the favorite,
after two or three losing breaks finished
third. Velma displayed good staying
qualities by drawing away from the trot
ter Clara L in the second heat and dis
posing easily of Elchora Wilkes in the
next heat in 2:26%. Mutuels paid $3 90.
Only four scored for the word in the
opening 2:40 class number, and Lady Lar
sen. over which Ed Aigeltinger held the
ribbons, -was touted as "the merchan
dise.". Dr.. A. McLaughlin behind the
"wiggler" Bondy C couldn't see It in that
light, going out and winning in straight
heats. Timeâ 2:31%, 2:39%. Mutuels on the
two heats paid, respectively. J9 65 and
$6 05. In the first heat Lady Larson lost
the place to Cuba, but filmed the tables
on Cuicello's trotter in the next-
The matinee racing given under the
auspices of the Golden Gate Park Driving
Association at Emeryville track yesterday
\*as liberally patronized by admirers of
the light harness horse, an unusually
large number of Jadics in hoiiday attire
gracing the occasion With their presence.
The sport was excellent,' with no "chop
ping" of heats being indulged in what
ever. Bondy C first for the 2:40 class race,
and Velma, winner of the 2:30 class event,
furnished the surprises, while later on Al
Bandy and Sable La Grand sent the fa
vorite players home on velvet.
For those who wished to speculate an
auction box and a Paris mutuel machine
dispensing $2 tickets, conducted under tbe
supervision of Harry Corbett, kept opea
house during business hours. As the
pleadings of Auctioneer George Tuthill
proved unavailing and the clicking of. the
French box was heard only at stated in
tervals, much after the belching of Mont
Pelee, it looked as if the public would pre
fer to buck the wily bookie with all his
percentage.
In the judges' stand H. F. Patrick and
E Sachs tendered decisions to the satis
faction of all. "Dick" Ledgett filled well
the position of starter, James Ohesley did
seme accurate clocking In the timer's
stand and Ira Barker oalzlel made an
ideal marshal. i â¢ L_:_
. . SABLE LA GKAND WINS.
Business was a trifle <JulI until the free
for-all - event, last on the card, slipped
around. It went to Sable La Grand in
straight heats, driven by the veteran Dan
Misner, with startling scenic effects by
Charles E. Parks, the "old hoes" of the
driving division, behind his toppy side
wheeler Imp. Sable La Grand ruled fa
vorite and took the first heat -in a head
finish from Mack, driven by M. M. Don
nelly. Mutuels paid $5. Imp had the red
flag Sashed til his face, and resented the
Â¦distance judge's action by trying to run
away ihe reverse way of the track with
Driver Parks. Just when It looked as if
the latter was booked for a most uneven
\ and lumpy ride Marshal Dalziel mounted
his saddle horse and succeeded in pulling
up the fractious pacer. After the usual
cooling-out pause Sable La Grand again
downed Mack in a whipping finish by a
half-length . for the second heat in 2:Z5\%.
Mutuels paid $3 2Â». The result caused a
mild mix-up among the backers of Mack,
who apparently thought that horse could
do better, tut beyond four or five vicious
swings, only one of which connected, no
fatalities were chronicled.

Track in Bedford Stakes
CHICAGO. May 30.â The grand stand at
Hawthorne race track. was destroyed by
fire this evening, half an hour after the
last race of the day had been run. Nearly
every one but the employes had left thÂ©
track. The fire started in the cupola of
the main building and gradually worked
downward, giving ample time for savins
the horses in the paddocK. as well aa af
. fording an opportunity for the escape of
a few stragglers who occupied the stand. 1
One man was killed during the fire and 1
several'men were badly injured, although,
none of them will die. The man who was
killed was a hanger-on at the track and,
v.as fcnown as "Chicken Pete" Ru3h. He.
with some others, was watching the tire
fiom the roof of the, engine i >use, which,
unknown to them, was on.li... The root
suddenly caved in and Rusa was burned
to death. The other men saved them
selves by jumping. Before the fire was
under control the paddock and betting
ring were in ruins. The loss will exceed
$100 000. Seven days of the present meet
ing remain. Arrangements were made to
nlght with the Harlem racetrack offlciaia
whereby the rest of the Hawthorne pro

LONDON, May 30.â The hopes of the
Americans, which were 'raised to such a
hlgn pitch during, the first few prelimin
ary games played by Captain , Foxhall
Kecne's polo., team, are . Jlkely ; to be
dashed to-morrow, as In the opinion of
nearly j all the â¢ polo experts, . both Ameri
can and English,* who have watched the
practice, the English team .Is sure to win
two but of three matches and retain* the
American challenge cup. It is . doubtful,
even, 1* playing at the top 'of their form,
the Americans will.be able* to defeat the
strong combination" which . the 'English
players have brought together*; .'but. in
addition to this fact, there, is not a mem
ber of the American, teams who is play
ing in hie best form, and; the Amer.can
ponies, as - well as the men. . seem to feel
the effects of this climate.'. . ...-. 'Â¦Â¦-Â¦<< Â¦-' <
â¢ When the Americans began splaying
here they showed a dash ana vim which
thoroughly alarmed. the Englishmen and
the fear was freely expressed in the r-olo
pavilions at Hurlirsgham and Ranelagh
that the Americans would -win. The bet
ting at that time also favored the-Ameri
cans, but this is all changed and the
Englishmen are very confident. The bet
ting to-night ranges from 2 to 1 to 5 to 1
on the English team. .'--.. ' -
One great disadvantage which both the
American and the English selection.com
mittee has to contend with : is Â¦ the ; vile
weather, which -left the. Americans shod
of practice and prevented ; , the English
players from being . selected at '. an early

A Preparation. Discovered That Will
Destroy the ' Dandruff Germ.
For. some "time It < has been knoWn that
dandruff Is caused by a germ that digs
tip the scalps Into little white flakes, and
by sapping the vitality .of the. hair at. the
root causes falling hair, and,, of course,
finally baldness. For years there have
been all kinds of hair' stimulants and
Ecalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no permanent cure for dandruff un-
til the discovery of. a preparation called
.Newbro's Herpicide,' which destroys the
Candruff germ. Destroy the' cause, the
effect will cease to exist. Kill the dan-
druff germ and you'll have no dandruff
no Itching scalp;, no falling hair. '

The only real contest was In the 36-foot
class, between E. F. bagar's Edna and the
Short Brothers' Emma, which. kept close
together for nearly the whole race! In
the last beat out- to Presidio Shoal buoy
both skippers miscalculated a; little, and
found- themselves unable ; to â¢ round the
mark without coming about. Emma made
two 1 attempts before she. succeeded in
rounding the buoy, the flood tide setting
her down strongly upon it. This gave Ed
na a commanding lead, and she ran home,
finishing 2 minutes 38 seconds, corrected
time, ahead of her rival.- Â¦.':<-Â¦

and might have won his game had his
t-tipport been good. He showed a world
cf speed, big curves and excellent con
trol, except when pitching . to batsmen

of timely hits. Ewlng*s bunch went

MORNING GAME.
Cricket in England.
LONDON, May 30.â Rain delayed the re
sumption at Birmingham of the first of
five test cricket -matches between Aus
tralia and England, which was begun yes
terday. The Englishmen, in their first inn-
Ings, when* they had scored 376 runs for
nine wickets down to-day, declared the
innings closed. That the Englishmen
were well advised to close their innings
and send in the Australians on a "wet
pitch" was quickly demonstrated. The
wickets of the visitors fell like ninepins.
The unprecedented rapid disposal of the
crack Antipodean cricketers caused a
great sensation. Two wickets fell for ten
runs; four were- down for twenty- two
runs, six for twenty-flve runs and the
Australians were all out in their first Inn
ings for a total of 36 runs. The Australians
in their second Innings had scored eight
runs for no wickets down when play was
stopped, owing to bad weather. ~

Cristall toed the rubber for Ewing, and,
as usual, was wild, but mysterious. The
Senators only connected with five of those
snakeiike offerings of his, and all were
fairly well scattered along the line. Had
it not been for the errors of the infield
the Senators would never have got any
thing that looked like a run. Cristall
hurried up in his delivery and shot the
ball over the plate good and fast.
McCreedie and Dunleavy packed off the
batting medals with three hits apiece.
Nothing of the sensational order occurred
Ti disturb the peace and quiet of the
bleachers, except a wonderful foul catch
by Tommy Sheehan. He made a great
sprint and caught the leather against the
etand near third base. Josh Reilly did a
few stunts just to help Fisher in his hour
. cf need. The score; ,
Dowling served them up for Sacra
mento and pitched fair ball. His support
was never anything like steady, the wnolo
team always going the balloon 'pace when
a. tight place was reached. Sheehan's arm
was too strong and he had a remarkable
faculty lor throwing into the bleachers
instead of Into the first-base man's mitt.
Ewlng's lads scored in the first on a
pass and a double, and again in the third
on thiee rank misplays and a pair of long
tingles by Mohler and McCreedie. The
old-time hit and run gag was renewed in
the fifth, and five pretty singles, includ
ing bunts by McCreedie ana Dunleavy,
started a procession of three commuters
ever the route.
The Senatorial aggregation accumu
lated all its good points in the second out
break. By a combination of errors on
the part of Cristall and Devereaux, Ho
gan's single over third and Dowling's
out between second and first four of the
politicians hot-footed over the finish.
They had all kinds of chances after that,
but never could hit the little white sphere
when the boys on the bags longed r I'or a
chance to sprint to the safe haven.
In both games the "gents from over the
pool" seemed to have a whole lot of com
passion for the unfortunate Senators.
They started out by going the erratic
pace and giving Mike a bunch of runs
lor a handicap. In both games the
chances of the Senators looked bright for
a time, but along about the lifth round a
little batting rsuiy happened to be pulled
oil ana then there was nothing to It.
The double-header system of handing
out the national game was inaugurated
yesterday at Recreation Park, with the
hope that it might bring gladness to the
heart of M. Fisher. Instead it gave two
more of those ashamed-to-take-the
rr.oney games to Ewing, all of which
makes Oakland look like a second Pitts
burg in the race for the cloth on top of
the flaestaff.

SANTA ROSA PRESS-DEMOCEAT
(DEM.): C-4;
That is the situation in the islands, and it has been
so.for a long time. Complaint after complaint has
been made of the evil, and report after report has
rendered the whole matter familiar to Congress.' Still
nothing has been done to provide an efficient and
'satisfactory remcdy.y \ ;,
It is to be borne; in- mind that the Government is
Recently the Manila Volcano said: "What' about
money in this archipelago?, It is nearly as debased
and depraved as the so-called Spanish laws. .,Cari
any intelligent gentleman" in these islands tell how
much in money he is worth? Can he bring from his
trousers pocket a handful of this bastard coin arid
tell its value? If so, can his neighbor' bring from
his trousers pocket the same number of coins of the
same denomination; and tell their, value? And if he
can, will the value of the two exhibits of depraved
currency.be the same in the opinion pf their pos
sessors? It will not. Now, if two individuals can
not agree on the value of the coins in their trousers
pocket, how are the 300,000 inhabitants in Manila
and the millions of inhabitants in this archipelago to
agree on a uniform value in their breeches pockets,
if they have any; or on the money in their posses
sion?" ,
The instability of the value of the currency in use
in the Philippines is a serious handicap on all kinds
of industry and works a grievous hardship to the
poor.. The evil is perceived by every visitor to
Manila. Only a short time ago a lady in that city
wrote to the Boston Transcript a review of condi
tions in the islands and safd: "Until the Govern
ment has an honest, stable currency and keeps faith
with its employes as a private business firm would
do there is very little chance of money-making."
""" a STRIKING illustration of the inability of
/\ Governments to deal promptly with abuses is'
Â¦L *â¢' to be found in the delay of the United States
Government to provide a stable and "reliable mone
tary system for the Philippine Islands. It is a sub
ject deserving the attention^ of persons who are in
clined to favor Government ownership of public
utilities, for it contains a warning of what would al
most surely happen in any\ department of public af
fairs the Government was called upon to regulate.
.The-rumor among those usually well inform
ed is that when Herrin and Burns give the
word ' the Governor will withdraw * trom the
field, leaving it apparently open, and that these
bosses will get behind Pardee of Oakland and
will endeavor to^ secure the nomination for the
latter.' That the bosses have a certain strength
is unquestioned,' for they have full control of
the Republican State machine, created and
managed by. Burns and Gage.. They can, un
doubtedly, transfer this - strength to any can
didate : they : choose to . get behind. " If . Gage
proves unavailable because ot his unpopularity
they^will take no chances! before the. people
.with such an Â¦ uncertain quantity. They will
unite upon a person equally as plastic in their
handn, . but I less susceptible to a suspicion of
being controlled by them. " The rumor that will
not down is to the effect that Burns and Her
rin have already united ' upon Pardee as the
candidate of the bosses . in the event that they
decide < not to run : Gage. . and that the latter
will be eliminated as a factor when Herrin and
Burns instruct him to withdraw, and in tho
latter event, that Pardee will be the nominee
for. Governor. ; . â¢ ' Â¦ .
As a result of the constant hammering away
at Governor Gage during the past y|>ar and of
the fact- that - he. is the most unpopular public
man in California to-day, it is possible and
more than probable that, when the Republican
State convention meets, he will not be a can
didate for renomination. 'Â¦ -.. -..'.â¢

CHICO RECORD* (DEBL):
The San Francisco, Call has stirred up a
large dose of trouble in'San Quentin, and unless
matters are straightened out there will likely
be several libel suits and a number of dead
political ducks on the bay shore. The charges
are eerlous concerning the actions of Warden
Aguirre and Governor Gage, and Include fraud,
forgery, malfeasance, obtaining i goods J under
false pretense and a robbing of the State with
the aid of convict forgers and the misapplica
tion of public authority. Bills are cited as
having been paid by the State through Aguirre
for goods and supplies for the benefit - of the
Governor's family, and The Call says it has

that certainly place a big lot of . officials in a

It has been a long war and a costly one both in

twr> republics, but it lays the foundation for a united
South' Africa that may some day become an. inde
pendent republic and be a far greater antagonist to
the of^imperialism, than the Transvaal and
the Orange Free State standing. by themselves could
ever have been. The men who are now arranging, the
terms on which Boer and Briton are. to. live together
are doing more than closing a war. They are.wind
ing up an old / order of things and making way ' for
new. No one can doubt that; a great future awaits

Out of the conflicting reports the world derives
the information that peace is at hand. There may be
hesitations, delays,- disagreements and Tpostponer
ments, but the fighting is over. It has been an
nounced that King Edward is eager for peace and
has been urging, the Ministry to grant liberal terms
for the . sake of obtaining it before S the coronation.
Whether that be true of the King of not it is cer
tain that public sentiment among the British people
is overwhelmingly in favor of peace. That sentiment
will have more weight with the Ministry than the
wish of the King, and it is not likely there willbe
any . insistence "upon unconditional surrender. - The
Boers will doubtless receive good, terms to compen
sate them to some extent for the surrender of their
independence. '_.'Â¦ -,.-,Â¦:
REPORTS from London concerning the peace
negotiations are .about as confusing as. the
nearly reports at the outbreak of the war con
cerning General Builer's operations. , It will be re
membered that in those days we used to hear that
Buller has crossed the river, Buller has recrossed the
river, Buller has once more crossed the riVer, and
again that Buller has recrossed the river. So it goes
now. One day peace is assured, the next day comes
a report thatthe Boers will ;not*agree to the Brit
ish terms, and then again we hear that peace .'will'-be
established in a few days. - .

making purchases of goods for the use of the
friends of the Warden and Governor Gage, and
the bills thereof were changed, or rather
forged, co that they appeared to be for goods
for the prison and were duly passed by the
Board of State Examiners. * The Call says that
not only one case, but many. ' whereby the
Warden -and Governor's friends robbed the
State, can be proven. The* charges are serious
ones and should be sifted to the bottom. If
there is ' any truth in them Warden 'Aguirre
should be removed at once and Governor Gage
be held responsible as well. The Call is not
likely, to make such serious charges unless it
can prove them, and these charges coming! as
they do, right after the charges of bratanty
and starving of prisoners at Folsora prison, are
not likely to assure the taxpayers that the
State money appropriated for prisons is not
being In considerable quantities put into the
pockets of dishonest officials.
DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS.
The Democratic : and' independent* newspapers 'of the State do not hesitate to" express opinions concerning the
attitude of Republican aspirants. ' Comments are as follow: , Â« >"Â¦-.*'
STOCKTON MAIL (DEM.):
Vi The Call continues to publish alleged proofs
of Its charges or corruption at San ' Quentln.
in which Governor Gage and Warden Agulrre
are implicated. The matter is of sufficient se
riousness to warrant an Investigation, and
manifestly no time should be lost in beginning
it. It is Vehemently declared that the State
has been made to pay for property for private
use and that forgery has b<?en resorted to in
order to make this' possible
In any event the region. comprised in the Central
Coast Counties has in itself enough of promise and
potency to excite not only the enthusiasm but the
energies of its people. The big wave, of migration
may subside for a time and the St. Louis, exposition
may not fulfill the sanguine expectations of its pro
moters, but none the less the enterprising men who
are working for the advancement of that region will
accomplish a large measure of success. They dan
offer inducements to settlers and to investors 'that no
other locality can exceed, and they have only to make
those inducements known to attract a class- of home
seekers who will know, how to profit by the oppor
tunities and make the most of thcmJ- -â¢ â¢ .
The postponement of the St. Louis exposition wilf
give the Central Coast Counties Association a chance
to make a full and striking exhibit of the resources
of their section of the State in conjunction with the
jest of California. From present prospects it seems
safe to conclude that the exposition will be one of
the most attractive as well as the largest ever held."
America never had a larger prestige in Europe than
at this time, and it is reasonable to expect a large
fpreign attendance at the exposition. Furthermore,
no. part of the United States is now attracting S o
much attention from men of large enterprise as the
Pacific Coast. It is reasonable to conclude* there
fore, that California exhibits at St. Louis will be even
more noted than were those at Chicago.
California cannot turn the course of the stream
of emigrants this year, but by following the example
of the Northwest and of Canada she can turn some
of it in this direction next year, and when once a
considerable current of migration is headed this way
thÂ»t class of people who follow the. crowd will join
with it, and the next big wave of migration from the
East will flow into California.
The Central Coast Counties Association comes
into being in time to direct the attention of this
horde of homr-seekcrs to the unrivaled advantages
of the region the association represents. It is not to
be expected, of course, that they can accomplish
much at the start. When large numbers of men
have "begun moving in a particular direction it is not
easy to turn them in another. The Northwest has
been advertised for years. The thoughts of intend
ing migrants have been directed toward it for a long
time.- That region of country is now profiting by
the work which was dene in the past. . The stream is
flowing that way, and the general mass of home
scekcrs is carried along by the stream.
The Call has repeatedly of late directed attention
to the vast migratory movement among the people
of the Eastern and the Mississippi Valley States.
Eastern papers agree that the movement is the lar
gest of the kind in the history of the country, sur 1
passing the great westward flow of population that
built up the Steles ot Kansas and Nebraska. The
movement is directed toward the Northwest It is
flowing into Montana and the Dakotas and over
flowing into the western provinces of Canada. The
number of American farmers who are migrating to
the Dominion is so large that it has set speculative
thinkers to debating whether in the near future
Manitoba may not be more' American than Cana
dian in its population.
movement has been started for the upbuilding of
those sections of California whose resources have not
jet been fully exploited nor '.advertised, nor even
thoroughly explored. The region of country included
in the scope of the work of the association is one of
the most picturesque, fertile and attractive parts of
the globe. It is blessed with a climate of unsur
passed benignity. It has remained undeveloped be
cause until recently it has been more or less cut off
from the great highways of travel, but the com
pletion of the Coast io2d places it upon what will be
the main thoroughfare between San Francisco and
the South,- and accordingly from this time on there
will be nothing to interfere with its rapid develop
ments .
WITH the organization of the Central Coast

San Jose on Thursday, another important
The great lesson to be derived from the city
election held at San Jose is that when all tho
people register and vote the best laid schemes
of the bosses gÂ» down to certain and sure de

American citizens. 'And. even then the bosses
were downed by only 300 votes. The boss

would have won. When all the good men vota

RED BLUFF PEOPLE'S CAUSE:
One of the' shrewdest political , observers In'
San Francisco, says the Eureka Standard, and
one who has been very 'close to Gage, said to
the writer" that unless Gape's friends carried
San Jose they must give up the contest for the
State. He saldr "It is no use to endanger Re
publican success and lose half or more* of . the
Congressional ticket to satisfy any man's am
bition ; and if this, election goes against Mac
kenzie's ticket Gage is out of the question."
These sentiments will be re-e*hoed from one
end of the State to the other. Some independ
ent Republican must be nominated. It will be
no easy task to pick the winner, but the north
ern part of. the â¬tate has claims to the nomina
tion, and it has a good, clean, honest and hon
orable man to present to the convention in the
person of Hon. E.B.Ed3on of .SIskiyou.
The Balzac case is even'more notable than that of
Rostand. It opens a way for. every Chicago man to
become a patron of art-and letters. He has only to
order fine editions of the works^of the masters, or.
lovely pictures with handsome frames; kVep them for
years and when called on to pay, for them refuse on
the ground that they are not fit for the Chicago do
mestic circle. It is a great scheme, and it must be
very comforting to the cultured elements and poets
of Chicago to know that they have courts which will
sustain them every time.
It appears that v the Chicago ; anonymunculus ( who
wrote, "Cyrano de "Bergerac" did not as a' matter of
fact write it exactly the same as Rostand, nor give
it the same name. He wrote a story of a man who
had a big nose and who helped another man to win a
bride.- Upon that basis Chicago holds he is entitled
to air the honors and emoluments of Rostand's play.
Chicago, in fact, excludes everything of poetry, sen
timent, eloquence,, wit and pathos v from considera
tion in matters of liteYature. The skeleton plot is
everything..^ In that respect" Chicago literary judg
ment differs from Chicago judgment on hogs, for in
the hog trade they are not content with the skeleton.
They demand the lard, the bristles and. the hoof.
A dispatch from "France reports that when Sarah
Bernhardt was asked what she thought of the deci
sion that a Chicago pork packer is thegenuine au
thor of "Cyrano" < she replied/that she now 'expects
another court of that city to decide that Mayor. Har
rison wrote "L'Aiglon." The expectation is 'hot un
natural, "and the fact ; that it ; is already felt- by one of
the^ leading lights of Paris shows how far and hbw
swiftly the fame of Chicago courts as masters of
literature has traveled.
Twice within a single week/has Chicago scored a
literary triumph -for her. people through, the processes
of her courts. First she, obtained from a' Judge a
decision that "Cyrano de Bergerac" was written by
a Chicago, man. Next she won a decree that a Chi
cago lady, may, order a fifty-volume set of Balzac's
works,. keep thenr four years,- read them, soil them,
and yet not pay" for them because they are unfit to be
read. . ;.'Â¦'" - > ' r ' : : Â¦ ' 'Â¦' \ Â¦ Â¦ . ' . >
AS a literary center Chicago is making history
rapidly, and in a very.unique way. . . Other
cities establish their prestige in the world of
letters by the aid of authors . who v write books and
win fame. Chicago resorts'to no such crude methods
as that. When she : wishes Â¦ to assert any literary'
claim she makes up a: legal issue, takes it to one of
her own' courts, gets a' decision .in her favor and
exults. " I "'Â¦: 'Â¦Â¦; â¢' .' : . Â¦"' '->~

ONTARIO BECOBD-OBSESVER:
San Jose held a city election on Monday,
and threw oft the shackles of boss rule. The
city has been for years tied up to the gang
that is now pushing Gage's interests there,
and the contest was openly and avowedly one
between the Gace and anti-Gage forces. Upon
the whole ticket. -only one Gasre man was
elected. The rout was as nearly complete as
the most sanguine could have hoped for. This
leaves Gage with a smashed . machine in his
own particular stronghold, no possible chance
<jf a' united delegation In his home county,
with San Francisco and Sacramento against
him. Alameda County divided, 1 and the whole
southern part of ' the State â the voters â bit
terly opposed to him. He ought to be able
to see the handwriting in this state of affairs.
HTJMBOLDT STANDARD: â¢;..,
Humboldt' s duty Is to select a delegation of
her best Republican citizens who are, not dom
inated by any man or machine; men who
know what sood citizenship requires \In every
office, and let them go to the convention un
pledged, save to do tifelr best to nominate
rood, clean, able men for every State of
fice. Then, when they are on the ground, they
can act for the best Interests of this county
and State. This should satisfy even a friend
of Governor Gage. When such a delegation
get into - convention they can support the best
and strongest - man, be he Flint or Edson,
Preston or Schmitz. or even a "dark horse.'
- It may be that besides having a candidate
for Congress this county has a man who
would aerve the State well â¢ in the offlee of
Railroad Commissioner: but tbat is a minor
question. We want upright, honorable, fear
less men' in office: Â¦ men who know but one
master, and that master the sovereign people
of the State. Give the Republican party such
a ticket and the State will roll up a grand
majority for it: give it any other sort and the
party will stand in grave danger of defeat.
The voters. - everywhere, are in about the
same temper they are here in Humboldt. They
must have fair arimartes, tickets nominated by
the people and not by the bosses, and then*
they will rally , at the polls and pile no a
splendid majority for the ticket. Republican
voters of this county should see to It that
such a ticket be placed in the field. But they
will not do it unless they get to work and as
sert their manhood, their right to select dele
gates' and candidates instead of . having the
"push" do It for them..
tlon to him is growing stronger, day by day,
in his own party. This opposition is morally
certain to defeat his aspirations to guberna
torial honors, either in the nominating con
vention or at the polls.
In view of this practical certainty that Mr.
Gage will be defeated If nominated, the folly
of those who are seeking to force his nomin
ation passes all comprehension. Their schem
ing to bring about his nomination is bad poli
tics, because he cannot be elected; bad morals,
because of his unsavory associations; and bad
faith toward the Republican party, because
those who are active in the matter profess to
be friends of the Republican party, whereas
they are ameng its worst enemies.
The administration of Governor Gage has not
been such as to win the -confidence of his own
party, nor that of the people at large. Irre
spective of party. Though pretending and
claiming much, it has been weak in most re
spects. But its great and pervading fault haa
been its shameless alliances with the disrepu
table elements of politics in both parties. In
this humiliating' fact is to be found the most
Important reason for the loss of public confi
dence^ by Governor Gage and hi3 adminis
tration.
If Governor Gage had not chosen to identify
himself with such men as Burns, Herrin, Kelly.
Crimmins, Burke, Lynch, Mackenzie â now the
discredited and defeated ex-boss of San Jose â
and other politicians with unsavory records, he
might .have retained In some degree the con
fidence and respect of hfs party. But almost
from the beginning of his official term it be
came apparent that his administration was to
be dominated by politicians of that class whom
the people distrust and despise. Is it any
wonder, under the circumstances, that the
public distrust and dislike have extended from
the political parasites and ringsters, who own
the Governor and his administration, to tha
Governor himself? Mr. Gaee deliberately
threw away his political future by casting his
lot with men of that stamp. He must abide
the conseauences.
1 It Is not in the least probable that the- ma
chine politicians who are managing the Gage
campaign will heed the handwriting on the
wall to such an extent as to desist from their
efforts to force upon the Republican convention
the nomination of this unpopular candidate.
So supreme is their confidence in the efficacy
of machine methods, that they will assume that
they can successfully override all opposition
and return their candidate to office against thÂ»
wishes of the people. They will learn their
mistake In due time. But the right and proper
place to teach them their mistake is first at the
primaries and next in the State nominating
convention. If their disliked and discredited
candidate be there defeated, the people will ba
relieved of the duty of defeating him at tha
polls In November.

; y-VEFORE the , San Jose election Santa . Clara. Humboldt
#5 and Sacramento counties were regarded as boss strong
â¢Â¦ââ¢. holds. Since: the utter rout of the Gage-Mackenzie push
in the first named county the Republican citizens of Sac
ramento and, Humboldt havebeen encouraged to renew their
efforts in the cause of good government and honest adminis
tration of public "affairs. AH signs" indicate' the defeat of the
Gage machine in the capital city. Colonel J. B. Wright, Bank
Commissioner, is known as a popular man and a good organ
izer,, but his popularity and organizing ability are not equal
to the task of lining up the people of that city for Gage. The
citizens of Sacramento ( have no enthusiasm and very little
respect for the Governor. The feeling, however, 'is not one
sided, as Gage does not appear to care a- tinker's blessing
whether the citizens of that place like or dislike him. He
prefers San Quentin to ; Sacramento Â¦ and is willing that the
world shall know his preference.* â¢
A. J. Johnston hopes to get from the Republicans of. Cali
fornia another nomination to the office of State Printer. He
lives in Sacramento and has strong home' support. The 7 pro
gramme prior to the San Jose election was that Gage delegates
under the cover of ;Johnston should be selected, but the
friends of Johnston, in the light of . recent developments, have
deemed it advisable _ to : ' Inform the public' in a general way
that the fight for . State Printer, as far as their candidate Is
concerned, Is* not connected with the contest for any other
State' office. Johnston may be able to win the ' support, of Sac
ramento for himself, but he cannot programme the delegation
of that county for Gage.
A' few weeks prior to the issue of the call for the Republi
can State Convention the Hurnboldt bosses said that every
thing was adjusted in that county and . that the delegation
Â¦would be" for Gage. It was then supposed by the machine
manipulators that appointed delegates would be recognized
and th.it Bull and Campbell would appoint the representatives.
Intelligence now comes from the. north that the citizens of
Eureka, Arcata and other places of the county intend to take
part in the election of delegates. There Is bound, to be an
animated contest at the primary election. If Humboldt County
throws off the yoke of bessism good citizens in every section
of California will have cause for great rejoicing.- Every com
munity discovers in time that there can be no material pros
perity or industrial development under boss rule. San- Jose,
emancipated, from boss rule, promises to achieve a full meas
ure of prosperity under the new regime. , ; f :
The Influential .newspapers of the State, in commening on
-the political [situation generally, hold to the opinion that Gov
ernor Gage's chances for renomination have vanished. He te
so closely allied with the bosses the people no longer have
confidence in him. The scandals touching his administration
of public affairs multiply. Here is a sample collection of com
ments:

LOS ANGELES TIMES:
As time passes the tact Is made more and
more apparent that Henry T. Gage cannot lie
re-elected. Governor of California. The opposr
That is a formidable indictment. It is not strange
that a people who have^o many grievancesyto com
plain of should demand the right of self-government.
Moreover, it is easy to see why such governmental
restrictions may materially interfere with the devel
opment of the Territories. Arizona, Oklahoma and
New Mexico have already a population large enough
to entitle them to statehood, and if they be admitted
it seems reasonable to assume their j populations
would be speedily doubled.
Mr. Smith sets forth a statement of ' specific
charges of wrong inflicted upon a people by Terri
torial governments with especial application to Ari
zona. He says: "Congress has given us a system
of courts inherently wrong. It has regulated the
number of our Judges, which is grossly inadequate,
and results often in delay and often in denial of jus
tice. It denies us the authority to call an extra ses
sion of the, Legislature unless the will of the Presi
dent be first consulted. It reserves the right to de
stroy any good obligation we may assume and has
actually validated and made binding on us a lot of
illegal railroad bonds which" the Supreme Court ok
the United States had previously declared void." It
prohibits us from expending our money on public
improvements, no matter how urgent our necessi
ties. It has stifled industries by prohibiting us from
selling mining properties in" foreign markets, thus
laying upon us an embargo not borne by the States.
It has exempted '400 'miles of railway from taxation
and^refuses to survey the enormous land grant of
said road so that taxes on the land might be im
posed by the Territory. It has, withheld the land
which belongs to our school fund, refuses us all con
trol over it- until we become a State, and then re
fuses us statehood. It gives us no representation in
either House of -Congress, and yet imposes taxes.
It has even refused to appropriate the salaries pro
vided by law for the hungry officials it has sent us.
It has persistently refused to pass laws by which tim
ber lands could be sold or leased, and has hedged
the limited right to tike timber for any purpose
with odious and impractical rules. And last, but not
least, it has fastened upon us an odious system of
carpet-bag rule." . .
It is a noteworthy fact that the residents of no Ter
ritory like a Territorial government. In every sec
tion of the Great West the people have, begun agi
tating for admission to statehood about as soon as
they are numerous enough to hold a convention^ or
rich enough to support a newspaper. ; That is in it
.self a strong argument for. statehood Why should
Congress impose upon any considerable number of
American people upon American soil a system of
government that is distasteful to them?
Of course the fact that these rapid increases of
population followed the admission of the several
Territories to statehood does not prove that the ad
mission was the cause of the increase. Still the fact
that th^ increase has been invariable after admission
shows that there is at least some stimulus given to
development by local self-government.
Mr. Smith asserts that Territorial government has
interfered with. the development of every section of
the country that has been under such government,
and that the acquirement of statehood has always
been followed by a rapid advance in population, in- .
dustry, wealth and education. He says: "In ten
years after statehood the population of Kentucky in
creased 200 per cent; Tennessee, 105 per cent; Ohio,
408; Louisiana, 100; Indiana, 500; Mississippi and
Alabama, over 400; Illinois, 350; Missouri, in;
Michigan, 221; Florida, 570; Iowa, 345; Wisconsin,
826; California, 370; Minnesota, 2370; and all the
balance taken together increased at the surprising
average ratio of 275 per cent." . %
MARCUS A. SMITH of Arizona \jri a speech
in support of the statehood bill now before
Congress made a review of the . relative
superiority of State over Territorial government,
and brought, together a number of interesting facts
concerning the development of the country. It is
one of the most instructive addresses delivered on
the subject, and while there may be objections in
some quarters to certain of its statements, there will
be no dispute concerning its essential merit as a
contribution toward the discussion of the right of
the people of the Territories to have a complete
State government as soon as they are fitted by their
wealth and numbers to sustain it. .

The exercises at the Presidio closed with

a detachment of United States troops and
the sounding of taps by the army buglers
The programme at the Presidio Cemetery
was as follows:
TROOPS FIRE VOLLEY.
Youth and old age united at the Na
tional Cemetery at the Presidio yester
day to do honor to the memory of those
who in defense of the Stars and Stripes
gave up their lives. Youth was repre
sented by the soldiers v stationed at the
Presidioâ while the members of the George
H. Thomas Post of the Grand Army of
the Republic were the men upon whom
rest the marks of age.
At the cemetery large crowds congre
gated to decorate the graves of those who
fell in defense of. nhe flag. Fathers,
brothers, gisters, mothers and friends of
the soldier dead visited the last resting
place of the boy in blue. When at 12 m
the national salute of 21 guns was fired
there was not a grave in the silent city
not decorated. Following the salute came
the rendering of "Nearer, My God, to
Thee*' by the artillery band. Then John H.
Roberts of George H. Thomas Post, who
acted as chairman of the day, spoke for
several minutes, reminding- the veterans of
the two wars of the sacrednes.-s of the day
and of the necessity of the continuance
of the yearly tribute paid to the men who
gave up their lives to enhance the slory
of the flag. Rev. W. W. Case delivered
the invocation, and the California Quar
tet rendered appropriate music The
orator of the day, Hon. A. J. Buckles,
Superior Judge of Solano County, followed
with an eloquent eulogy In which he
spoke of the loss in numbers of the Grand
Army since the last memorial day cele
bration, and called upon the younger men
to "see to It that the brave spirits who In
defense of the flag had braved the dangers
of a foreign land, and carried the banner
of freedom to victory" were not forgot

taken, i , ,
All the events, forty in number, were
keenly contested. . Most interest was
evinced in the bagpipe competition for a
$200 gold medal. There were only four
contestants, several who had entered not
making their appearance. The judges, who
were in a tent so that they could not see.
the contestants, were John Morrison and
D.. D. McRae of Sacramento and James

pibrochs, marches, reels and strathspeys.
The first prize was awarded to Ed Ross/
the second to "Adam Ross and the third
to W. Ranwick.'
MANY PHIZES FOR CAMPBELL.
MAYOR SCHMITZ SPEAKS.
There w^re loud cries for a speech, and
the Mayor laughingly compiled. He said
he had heard a great deal of the hospital
ity of the Scotch people in their native
land, and although he had not had th<Â»
pleasure, of visiting "the land o' cakes,"
he was , satisfied from his experience on
the picnic ground that the term, "genuine
Highland hospitality" could be ungrudg
ingly bestowed upon the Scotchmen resi
dents in San Francisco. He expressed
himself as. delighted with what he had
seen and concluded by paying a compli
ment to the officers of .the club. His re
marks .were greeted with loud cheers...
A large number of enthusiasts from a
distance -were present. Among them was
a delegation of more than fifty from Sac
ramento, including ex-Chiefs John Morri
son. James McCaw, Tom Scott, H. K.
McLellan and D. D. McRae of the Cale
donian Club of that city; David Hanna of
Germantown, Glenn County, and Robert
McQuarrie of Vallejo.
Among the guests of the club from the
c'ty were Judges Carroll Cook, Hunt, Mo
gan and Cabaniss; former Judge Belcher;
Rev. Fathers Grant and Praught, Gavin
McNab, Jlmmle Britt, Assistant -District
Attorney Greeley and Chief Deputy Cor
oner P. J. McCormick.
A pleading feature of the outing was the
presence of Mayor Schmitz, accompanied
by his wife. They seemed to thoroughly
appreciate the dancing by girls and boys
in. Highland costume and the other
events. They were escorted to the pavilion
by *t-Chiefs D. R. McNeill, Angus Mc-
Leoaand John F. Kennedy, and as they
entelbd the band*- played "Hail to the
Chief." J . Â¦Â¦> .
8000 people were on the grounds,"
and from the general expressions heard
they all thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
The weather was perfect and everything
tended to a most enjoyable outing.

In th* Mexican war, entered Â» into to pre
serve the liberties and Independence of Ameri
can citizens' in Texas.- our flag swept out be
yond the borders of our own land, nor stopped
nor stayed its onward march of conquest until
all the territory from the Rio Grande to the
capital of MptIco acknowledged its supremacy
In 1812. by the valor of our soldiers and
sailors and the splendid statesmanship of our
rulers, the United States won recognition from
s.11 the world as an international power; and
we cet at naught the decrees of Napoleon pro
mulgated at Berlin and Milan, and the Order
of Council issued from the etar chamber of
England, and by a series of brilliant victories
on land and pea won immunity from search
cf American ships and respect for the rights
of sailors under the American flag.
It is a beautiful and noble ceremonial, this
American custom of decorating the graves of
the departed Â«n a holiday appointed by the
supreme authority of the nation. For a time
the minds and the thoughts of the participators
are raised above the sordid desires and crav
injrs of our far too strenuous form of living,
â¢nd we are taught the great lesson of human
equality, for all who lie beneath these grassy
mounds in eternal eleep are equal.
To-day we remember the great revolution,
when three millions of colonists, scattered over
a sparely settled territory extending from
Maine to Florida, along a little fringe of civ
ilization, the edge of an tm broken wilderness,
dared to defy the powerful mother country,
and ring out the tocsin of liberty and equality;
dar*>d to proclaim to a listening world the glad
tidings of the birth of a new nation whose
foundations' were laid In righteousness and
Jostlce.
On this morning, in every part of our land.
flags are fluttering at half mast; children are
gathering into eager groups before the school
house doors under the guardianship of patriotic
teachers; business men have forsaken their
stores banks and factories; the mechanics and
laborers have ceased their labors for a time;
the vouths and maidens, the matrons and the
head's of families, the old ..and the young are
participating in processione wending their ways
toward the silent cities cf the dead. Each and
all bear with them some token of affectionate
regard, seme tribute of love and remembrance,
la the form of nature's richness the wealth
of spring â for to-day is our national Memorial
day.
People cf every creed and every faith,
of every previous nationality and every
clime, of every shade of political opin
ion and belief, may Join together upon the
broad level of American patriotiem, and., side
by side, keep solemn etep to the tiirgea of
mourning a.s they press onward with hearts
filled with loving thoughts, grateful senti
ments and noble and patriotic impulses, bear-
Ing their offerings to decorate and beautify
the last sad resting places of the loved and
lost of days gone by.
John D. Gish, chaplain of the Sons of
Veterans, read the "Speech of Lincoln at
Gettysburg." and Clara Bell Brown read
an appropriate original poem, entitled
"Hc-roes Then and Now." A class of fifty
beys and giris from the James Lick
Grammar School sang in a feeling man
ner "The Nation's Dead"; and the
Knickerbocker Quartet sang "Rest,
Peaceful, Rest" and the "Heroes Who
Sleep." A squad from Company D, First
Irtantry, National Guard of California,
fired a volley over the graves and Bugler
Archie Block sounded taps. Duncan E.
McKinlay delivered the oration of the
clay. He spoke in part as follows:
members cf the Grand Army who were
left to shower honors upon the graves of
their departed comrades, and prayed that
all those present might be left in the laud
of the living to participate in the cere
monies of the next Memorial day. He
thar.ked God that so many of the "heroes
of '61" were still able to give honor to tht
dead, and prayed ferventiy that they and
tneir successors might be granted many
ye&rs of life in which to preserve the
great and glorious Union the men whose
graves they decorated had died to keep
intact.

Then the black shadow of the tragedy of our
history passed over the fair face of the land
and obscured the brightness of our country's
splendor. Eleven Southern States, containing
eight millions of people, nearly one-third of the
population of the entire Union, were swept into
insurrection against the Government and an
tagonism to the country's flag.
Of the heroes of the supreme tragedy of our
country's life, the four years of blood and

Leeds did not disturb the bodies, but
carefully marked the site of the cave and
after prospecting returned to Valdez. An
expedition is being organized, headed by
Captain Story of the Alaska Packers' As
sociation, to make a thorough, exploration
of the cavern and the remains that repose
therein. â¢ ;*?.:
The find was as big a mystery to the
natives as to the white man. Their tribe
has been on the shores of Prince William
Sound for a period so remote that their
traditions do not run back to the time
of its advent there, yet they have had
no knowledge of the cave or of the char
acter of people who are Interred there.
Nor do the present natives use stone im
plements.
TACOMA, May 30.â A remarkable dis
covery has been made on the shores ot
Prince William Sound. While a prospector
named Leeds was out' with a party of
natives looking for mineral \ he came to
the entrance of a large cave, almost" con-*
cealed from view. Leeds entered* the
cavern and was astonished to find there
fourteen wooden canoes, each containing
a mummified corpse. Stone implements
were found beside the bodies and stone
slabs covered" the canoes, everything in
dicating that the bodies, had been placed
there during the stone age.

.LONDON, May 30.â The birthday of
King Edward, - who was born November
V1841, was officially celebrated to-day, tt
having been decided, as announced in the
official gazette April 15, that his Majesty's
natal day was to be celebrated in London
and on the home stations May 30, as be
ing the most suitable. to make a military
display. On the other hand, foreign sta
tions will celebrate it November 9, the
actual anniversary of his birth.
General interest in the celebration was
apparently not seriously diminished by
the expectations of the greater series of
events surrounding the coronation. The
towns throughout ihe kingdom were gay
ly. decorated and the shipping at the vari
ous ports made the gayest displays of
bunting. The day was observed at all
the home. military : and naval headquar
ters with parades and salutes.
The chlet celebration was the ceremony
of "trooping the colors" at the Horse
Guards here and the presentation of col
ors to the new Irish Guards. Stands cov
ered with crimson cloth were erected on
three sides of the parade grounds and
were occupied by thousands of privileged
spectators, including the United States
Ambassador, Joseph H. Choate, and Mrs.
Choate, and the . secretary of the United
States embassy, Henry White. Thou
sands of other persons were grouped
dosely around the lines of sentries. The
troops taking part in the ceremonies were
battalions of the Irish Guards, Grenadier
Guards, Scots Guards and detachments of
the Life Guards..
Tremendous cheering greeted the ap
pearance of the King and his brilliant
Â£f. co^' , whIch Included many notabilities.
His Majesty, who rode between the Prince
of Wales and the Duke of Connaught
wore the uniform of a colonel of the Irish
Guards. Lord Roberts, the commander
in chief of the forces, who led the proces
sion, also wore the uniform of colonel of
the Irish Guards. Queen Alexandra and
other members of the royal family viewed
the scene from the windows of the Horse
Guards. The 'crowds present bared their
heads while his Majesty proceeded to the
saluting point. -
After an inspection of the line of troops
and the presentation of the colors the
ceremonies ended with a review of all
the troops on the ground. ( The King dur
ing the afternoon presented colors to the
King b Company of the Grenadier Guards.
Ihe weather was wet and raw.
King Edward Invested the Duke "of
?KÂ° U f h . an . d tne Duke ot Bedford
with the insignia of the Order of the
Garter at Buckingham Palace this after
noon. The ceremony was more Imposing
than any similar event which > had oc
curred for years, it being the King's In
te l ?} Z n . to revlvc a11 the old-time pomp
which formerly distinguished the ceremo
nies connected with this order. A notable
company of Knights of the Garter, in
cluding the Prince of Wales, the Duke of
Ccnnaught, the Marquis of Salisbury the
".^"i? i, of Londonaerry and ,the Duke
of Norfolk, attended. ,'
There is no truth In the report pub

More than 2500 people journeyed to Glen
Ellen yesterday to participate in the fif
teenth annual parish picnic of Holy Crosa
Church. The outings of the parishioners
have always been highly successful, but
this year's affair eclipsed them all, both in
point of attendance and in the enjoyment
afforded the pleasure seekers. It required
two trains of fourteen cars each to carry
the crowds. Rev. Father McGlnty, paato*
o* the church, was ubiquitous In his at
tentions to the comfort of his flock, and
not a single unpleasant feature marred
the success of the outing. Lunch baskets
were largely in evidence- and dancing and
games contributed to the pleasure of the
day. The following committees n\4 the

| ELLIOTT'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
President Elliott delivered his annual
address. After congratulating the mem
bers on the prosperity of the past year,
he said many had been Impressed with the
necessity of investing funds in something
In addition to ordinary loans. Said he:
We have been offered from time to time
bonds issued by various railway, street rail
way, electric lighting, water, gas, irrigation
and similar companies and the question as to
whether this or that j corporation issuing said
bonds was a quasi public corporation, and
therefore was called upon to pay Its own taxes,
without any reference to the mortgage placet
upon it to secure said bonds has been of in
tense interest to us. In the case of railway
and street railway obligations there can be no
doubt, as the constitution specifically names
these corporations, but in regard to the others
there appears to be considerable doubt, some
1 attorneys being afraid to give an opinion that
' j will ' justify us ln taklnsr a bond unless some
extraneous provision, such' as an additional
coupon, is made for the payment of taxes on '
the bond in case the corporation may be de-
I termlned to be merely a private one, such
j agreement often being more dangerous as a
j remedy than the trouble itself.
Special Dispatch to The, Call.
. PORTLAND, Or., u May . 30.â Sylvester
Pennoyer, - Governor of Oregon from " 1888
to 1894, died suddenly this afternoon at his
home .in ; this 'city; of heart trouble. He
had" been in poorjhealth for. the 1 past year,
though he was able to be on* the street and
spent s a , great of. his time on his
farm r a' few; miles from this city. About
5 \ o'clock^ this afternoon Mrs. 1 ; Pennoyer,
who had been down town, returned home,
and," going to; the library, saw. the "ex-
Governor, lying, on the floor, with a pillow
under his head. She asked tiim if he want
ed} his .''evening, paper, and, .. receiving " no
reply, took hold. of his hand. She tried
to.arouse him, but in; an instant dis
covered'that the ex-Governor, was dead.
" Sylvester Pennoyer was born- in Tomp-Â«
kins County, New York, July 6, 1831, and
was in his seventy-first year. - He gradu
ated from Harvard University in 1S54 and
the next year came to Oregon by way of
the Isthmus of Panama! He taught school
for, some time and about the > year 1862
engaged' in the lumber business, in which
he continued until his death.
-While he ; was somewhat prominent in
the State as 'a- political writer, he never;
figured In actual politics until his nom
ination for Governor in, 1886 by the Demo
crats. The nomination was brought about
chiefly by his bold stand. against Chinese
immigration. He was elected by 4000 ma
jority, although the remainder of the Re
publican ticket received nearly 10,000 ma
jority. He was re-elected in 1890 -.by : an
increased majority. In 1896 he was elected
Mayor. of this city.
, - Pennoyer was brought prominently be
fore the country in 1891,. oh account of his
refusal to meet President Harrison at the
State line when the latter was on a- visit
to the Pacific Coast. He was again much
talked about in 1893, when he told Presi
dent Cleveland to attend to his own busi
ness. The telegraphic correspondence be
tween Secretary of State .Walter Q.'
Greaham .and the Governor, which
brought j forth the latter's curt reply, was
as follows â¢Â¦Â¦
"WASHINGTON'. D.7 C.; May 3. 1893âGov

â¢The Governor's reply was as follows: -

HONEST DOCTOR
Speaks of Coffee Drinking.
About coffee drinking. Dr. Hewet says:
"I have the best of reasons for naming
cofiy-e as among the most dangerous of
slow poisons. My own personal experi-
ence outside of the general experience
gained by my practice has taught the
truth.
"At about sixteen I became a member
of a young people's society whose pledge
barred the use of all intoxicants, tobacco,
tea and coffee, until the age of twenty-one.
I kept my pledge and early temperate
habits were formed. Up to about my
thirtieth year I was an athlete: no one
had better health or spirits.
"A short time after passing thirty I be-
gan the use of coffee at breakfast with
on occasional cup at evening parties.
The fire t symptoms of 111 health I remem-
ber came soon, and alter sore mouth and
etomach trouble. Finally well marked
dyspepsia supervened. My bowcl3 sym-
pathized, of course, also my nervous sys-
tem became impaired. Dizziness attacked
me, and tremulant hands rendered writing
exceedingly difficult. My diet had to be
restricted. Experienced medical advisers
I forbade all Iruits.
"Several attacks of gastritis troubled me
and bowel complaint became Quite fre-
quent. The shadow of melancholia
menaced me and caused me to wonder
why a man of my lineage, strength and.
endurance and temperate habits should
be thus afflicted.
"Eminent specialists named it 'miasm,*
others as noted said -'microbes.' I now
Bay 'coffee arablca.' Why? Because for
the first thirty years I did not drink cof-
fee and enjoyed good health, the second
thirty years coffee drinking became a
habit and illness more - than kept pace
with the indulgence.
"I am now past 60 years of agj. About
eighteen months ago I saw a .shrewdly
written statement of Postum Cereal Cof-
- fee. I gave it careful reading and
thought, and as an experiment substituted
Postum for Java and Mocha.'. For the
first three days of the change I felt keenly
the loss of the stimulant, after that the
liutrlent quality of the drink more than
compensated the dc-nrl vation, and an as\
tonlEhing change came in recurring' hun-
ger three times daily; I could ' scarcely
wait for meals, a sensation I had not ha J
fcr mere than thirty years.
"Now ray" health is excellent. I eat
Iruits cf all kinds and food as my ap-
' petite demRnfis. 1 am regaining my ner-
vous tone and my strength is increasing
dally. Except my change from coffee U>
Postum I have made no change In ray
mode of Iivins.
"Do you wonder that 1 name coffee as
among the most dangerous of slow
poisons?
"I believe there are thousands, suffering

IN spite of a delay of five Â«Jays in
quarantine at Yokohama the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha steamship America
Maru, which arrived yesterday, was
only two days behind her scheduls
time.. She .made up more than seventy
two hours between Tokonama and San
Francisco and her passage from the Jap
anese port to Honolulu was the second
fastest that has ever been made.
A case of cholera in the Asiatic steerage
caused a detention at Woosur.g, and when
the liner reached Yokohama the authori
ties fumigated her and held her for five,
days in quarantine. There was no further
sickness aboard, , however, and after a
thorough examination the authorities at
that port granted the vessel free pratique.
The America Maru brought ninety-live
cabin passengers and 213 in the steerage.
Of the cabin passengers many are going to
England to attend the coronation. of the
British King-. Among the passengers were
many prominent Japanese, chief of whom
was Baron. E. Shibusawa. one of Japan's
wealthiest and most influential citizens.
The dining saloon was elaborately dec
orated in the Baron's honor and his pres
ence <?o board cost the steamship com
pany many extra tons of coal cremated in
the effort to make up for time lost lu
quarantine.
The America Maru's time from Yoko
hama to Honolulu Â¦was exactly nine days,
â¢which is within a few hours of the record
run. made by the China. v_

ST. JOSEPH,
Eastern Livestock Market.
Shibusawa is president of- fortv stock
companies, representing an aggregate cap
ital of $100,000,000, The companies are pay
ing dividends of from 5 to 20 per- cent.
The Baron expects to remain in San
Francisco several days and among other
places he will visit the Union Iron Works.
He intends touring England, France, Ger
many and Belgium before- returning to
Japan. - \ Â¦ "
, Among those traveling in the Baron's
party are Dr. and Mrs. Takamine of New
York. Dr. Takamine has ma,de several
valuable scientific discoveries. His wife
is an American by birth.
Baron Shibusawa was created a Peer in
1900 by the Emperor of Japan in recogni
tion of his services in building up the
commerce of his country and in develop
ing, as much as possible, what is known
among the more progressive men of his
race as the "New Japan." The Baron is
touring the world for pleasure, but hopes
that his observations will be of benefit
to his countrymen on \ his return home.
He is rated as a multi-millionaire and has
held many important offices under the
Emperor. For many years he was presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce at
Tokio. Â¦ -
Among the .'Â¦ arrivals from- the Orient
yesterday was Baron Eilchh Shibusawa,
one of the richest merchants of .Japan;
He is accompanied by 'a, large retinue of
secretaries and servants and. an inter
preter.
The facts of the case were detailed at
a meeting of the Commissioners of Lun
acy, who examined the child and pro
nounced him Insane. The medical gentle
men declared the case one with few paral
lels. One of them said that the child had
doubtless inherited its taint from some
ancestor, and that its development was
accelerated by reason of the deafness of
the child, which rendered salutary educa
tion impossible. The case is regarded as
incurable, but. nevertheless, it will be
watched with interest by physicians.
Sister Mary, who is in charge of the
asylum, called the attention of Dr. Alfred
McLaugbiin to the strange conduct of the
child, and an examination developed the
surprising information that Mannie was
insane. The child was found to be abso
lutely impervious to restraint. He seem
eduto recognize no one, nor indeed, did he
show any consciousness of the presence
of others about him. The lad would walk
about like an automaton with head erect
and eyes staring Into vacancy, and, it
allowed to do so, would walk into
a wall or over a precipice. The only
thing that awakened his Intellect to some
show of life was the sight of flre, an ele
ment which he apparently loved. Another
manifestation observed by Dr. McLaugh-
Hn was the child's, fondness for hurting
children smaller than himself, a mania
that lacked only sufficient strength in its
possessor to make him a murderer.
FIND CHILD IS INSANE.
?Â», \ case ?,* IU V e Ma nniÂ» came under
the observation of James Ryan, a aolici-
t * r 'w a few , dflys a 8 t Â°Â» and with the consent
of his only guardian Mannie was taken
to Mount St. Joseph's Infant Asylum in
South San b ranclsco. The child was
paced in a ward with several others of
his own age, but scarcely was the back of
the attendant turned when Mannte began
his tricks. He caught a baby girl in his
arras and was biting her cheek viciously
when the nurse rescued her. A slight pun
ishment being inflicted, Mannie snapped
at the hand that was chastising him. his
face convulsed with rage. He ran to a
window and sought to jump through it,
regardlesb of the fact that it was twenty
feet from the ground. When placed in
his cot he uttered inarticulate cries and
fought savagely. Within an hour after
being admitted Into the institution Man
nie had succeeded In creating a reign of
terror among the little inmates.
? u e w*Â° uld Blt for hours chewing his
?Â£"?Â£ U f Ul the blood cam *. a "<l. tasting
the life-fluid, the child became voracious
as a beast. He was transformed at these
hmf 5 1J J to ., a beas , t t lacking all the attri
butes-of human kind, and it was found
necessary to strap his arms to his side
il:mi25 r - to "- p <!! e y e Â« llt h J m from lacerating
himself m satisfying his unnatural appe
tite tor blood.
LACKS HUMAN ATTRIBUTES.
Mannie Janson is the child of a seaman
now in foreign seas, who deserted the
youngster on the death of its mother,
about a year ago. He left Mannie in
charge of a woman who lived in a board
ing-house on Mission street, near the wa
ter front. Mannie, although deaf* and
dumb seemed to be endowed with all the
faculties of sane bÂ«ingrs until three
months ago. when he developed a mania
for playing with fire". He loved to watch
the burning of matches, and on several
occcasions set fire to his clothing, and
fairly shrieked in delight while the flames
burned his quivering flesh. He seemed in
sensible to pain, and pleasures eagerly
|Â£ u f* t h for fa y normal children were avold-
The victim of hereditary Insanity, with
a mania destructive in its tendency even
to the point of suicide, is the remarkabie
story of little Mannie Janson, a curly
haired, blue-eyed child of nearly four
years, which was committed. to the asy
lum for thi insane at Napa by Judge Heb
bard Thursday. Coupled with the Insan
ity of the little Xellow.was the double in
firmity of dumbness and deafness, so that
the lad became a mere human machine,
full of vitality like the beasts in the field,
but infinitely more â¢ Irresponsible than
they.

Grain quotations made a decided advance
early in the week, which was not easily ex
plained, except on the basis of light supply in
slrht. This element was not new, receipts
having decreased materially | for many weeks
in comparison with last year's movement
Subsequently the gain was lost ! in option
trading, although corn was firmly held."
Failures for the week numbered 194 in the
United States against 148 last year and 20 in
Canada against 20 last year. - ' â¢" Â¦
No imarovement is reported at - New Eng
land by shoe-maklne centers, where the shops
are still running only about half time. There
is a little more activity In . the . grades that
declined last week, but no indication of re
covery in prices, . and other varieties tend
downward. Salesmen are 'booking a smaller
percentage Â¦ of orders at the south, which is
unusual at this time of the year. Local retail
trade has been more active, but Jobbing-busi
ness continues slow. Recent â¢. advances in
leather are ! maintained, with belting beiny
freely Durchased. Imported hides are. scarce
and strong, but domestic packer hides are
more Quiet. Stocks of textile goods are' not
accumulating-, although the markets are ex
tremely quiet. Domestic jobbing trade is fairly
satisfactory, but exports of cotton ; goods are
email. Print cloths are dull and unchanged,
with the J situation unsettled as to prints for
fall- delivery. Clothing manufacturers are pur
chasing woolen goods In moderation only, and
the larrer deliveries by the leading consumers
increases i the disposition toward stagnation, i
Prospects are bright for a large yield of cot
ton. Dispatches have been received from cor
respondents of Dun's located in all parts of the
cotton belt and the returns are unanimously
encouraging. "Â¦ .
Efforts to ulace contracts for 100,000 tons of
pig Iron deliverable in Â¦ the second quarter of

sumers as to the future of this Industry.
There is no cessation of activity at the .mills
and finished products are forwarded to impor
tunate consumers as rapidly as possible.'. '
Despite the short corn crop last year, the
large yield of wheat and high prices for both
resulted In the greatest value for the two crops
ever recorded, which means that the agricul
turists generally are prosperous and other In
dustries muit share the good fortune Â¦â¢ by in
creased sales of products.. Collection* 'are
prompt as a rule and payments throughout the
Principal clearing-houses are. well maintained.
Notwithstanding diminished speculation, there
was an increase of 1.2 per cent at New Tork
compared with last year's exchanges. Return?
as to the, transportation show that losses In
strain movement are being more -than made up
elsewhere. Rainroad earnings : thus far -re
ported for May show a sain of 6.5 per cent
over last year and 19 per cent over 1900. '
- Ease ' in the money market, favorable crop
prospects and confidence- abroad % arc the en
couraging factors which 'outweigh the disturb
ing elements of labor conflicts and unseason
able weather for retail trade at many points.
Effects of .the j depressing Influences are thus

A Healthy and Sound Body Will
d Enable Us to Battle Against
% the Wrongs and Injuries-
of Our Enemies.
Paine's Celery
Compound
Banishes Disease, Establishes Health
and Gives Us Physical Strength
to Maintain Our Place in
I Life's Conflict.
of U3 find life hard an</full of
i While we cannot well aroid the
rfaSerings that result from wrong- and
injuries, we can keep ourselves from the
pains and ravages of bodily ailments and
diseases and maintain that full measure
of health that will enable ua to meet the ,
wrones that assail us from day to day.
If you are run down, fretful, despond-
ent. Irritable, sleepless, be assured you
are becoming physically Impaired and
weakened. If the relaxed and sluggish
action of the excretory organs has loaded
the blood and body with poison, produc-
> ing headache, rheumatism, neuralgia, kld-
! ney and liver troubles then disease is en-
, circling you In Its chains.
f Prompt use of Paine' 6 Celery Compound
will save the weakened parts of the body
from yielding to disease. The great medi-
cine saves weak and enfeebled nerves
from prostration and removes every feel-
Ing of exhaustion and despondency. It
cures and saves those who are bound by
disease and suffering and gives them a
new lease of life.
Ex-Alderman Fred G. Brenner of Troy,
N. Y., a popular and esteemed citizen
who thanks Paine's Celery Compound for
his present rugged good health, writes
for the benefit of weak, nervous and
dyspeptic sufferers; he says:
"For several years I suffered from ner-
vous troubles; I could not sleep well;
nerves seemed to be weak; I had dyspep-
sia, and was all run down. My appetite
began to fall me and I was discouraged.
A friend of mine recommended me to
Take Paine's Celery Compound. I took
a'.to bottles and began to feel better and
yty the time I had taken four bottles I
was a well man. I have to thank Paine's
Celery Compound for my rugged good
health to-day."

The contest is exciting an * unusual
amount of interest, not only because the
perpetual challenge cup is The blue rib
bon of local yachting, and the boats rep- '
resent those old-time rivals, the San
Francisco and the Corinthian Yacht clubs,
but also because The Challenger was de
signed by the famous Eastern designer.
Crowninshield, of Boston, while Harpoon
was designed and constructed here. When
The Challenger was first put into the wa
ter, yachtsmen were much struck by her
clean, racy appearance. They thought she
would carry off the cup, but It was found
she heeled over top much in a. strong
breeze to do her best work. Her mast has
been cut down and 105 feet of canvas tak
en from her mainsail. It is hoped her
speed in a stiff breeze, such as is almost
certain to prevail to-day, will be increas
ed. While The Challenger is wonderfully
quick in stays, she is .said by some ob
servers not to point so high as she should.
Others think a short choppy will
cause her to pound heavily on account of
her long forward overhang.

The Geary-street cable was cut entirely
in two, and tho service on the road was
suspended for six hours, while the cable
was being spliced.
The gripman of the car claimed that his
clutch failed to let go when he raised the
lever. A G^ary street car was close to
the junction at the time, and this raised
the cable higher than it is ordinarily. The
crew of the Geary-street car claimed that
the gripman of the O'Farrell-street car
tried to cross ahead of them and in doing
so caused the accident. He was not en
titled to the right of way, and in his hur
ry to get across failed to let go of tne
cable.
Owing to the fact that the gripman on
car 29 of O'Farrell-street line forgot to
raise his clutch while crossing Geary on
Jones street three women were thrown
from the car, about 5 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, and one was severely injured.
The clutch of .the grip struck the taut
cable on Geary street with terrific force
and nearly all the passengers riding on
the outside were thrown from the car.
Mrs. Kussbaum, residing at 660 Geary
street, was so severely bruised that she
had to be carried to her home. Last
night it was stated that her injuries
would not prove' serious. Mrs. Wigit of

for F. Ducurulo, left his wagon standing
at the corner of Twenty-fourth and Bran

serve a customer. When he stepped from
the door he observed two men in the act
of mounting the seat, and called to them
to desist. Little heed was given his com
mand and the driver, rushing forward,
seized one of the men by the arm and
started to pull him to the ground. Noting
the resistance of the driver to their plans
of escape, the other robber drew a rt
volver from his pocket and leveling: It at

head if he did not "make himself scarce."

As soon, as the resignation of Captain
Seymour was filed Chief Wittman detailed
Captain John B. Martin to assume the du
ties of the vacant office. Captain Martin
was only raised to his present rank last
Tuesday night and this second elevation,
while totally unexpected, meets with the
enthusiastic approval of the department
and the public. Although mostly engaged
during his police career in line work.
Captain Martin has made a reputation as
a keen and intelligent investigator on spe
cial duty, which guarantees that the
same success will attend him in his new
position which he has met with through
out his eighteen years of police duty.
Owing to the resignation of Captain Sey
mour, a -vacancy exists among the cap
tains and this will be filled at the next
meeting of the Police Commission. Lieu
tenant George Blrdsall of the City Hall
station is the next eligible on the list.
and undoubtedly will receive the'appoint
ment. He probably will be assigned to
the Central station AS he is familiar with
the district. , Â¦
Chief of Police Wittman is the' only
man in the department who was made a
confidant by Captain Seymour of his in
tended resignation, and although the
Chief regretted losing a tried and trusted
subordinate, with whom he had always
maintained the most, pleasant relations,
he agreed with the captain that to refu3e
the offer of the Fair estate would be the
height of foolishness. Chief Wittman
.will tender a banquet to Captain Seymour
to-night at a downtown restaurant, at
which the higher officers of the depart
ment and many prominent citizens will
â¢wish the detective success in his new field
of labors. . . < " ' . .' -â¢
WILL BANQUET SEYMOUR.
â¢ SEYMOUR'S NEW POSITION.
Captain Seymour refused to disclose
what^ his position with the Fair estate
will be, but from other sources it .was
learned that his duties will be managerial
and his salary $7500 a year. In addition
to this his family will receive a pension
in case of his death to compensate for the
loss of the police pension which Captain
Seymour forfeits by reason of his sum
mary ' resignation.
The former chief of detectives was born
in New York in 1853, and is a brass pol
isher by trade. He was, appointed to the
police force in May, 1884, and was made a
corporal in 1891. He acted as a detective
for several years and his work in many
notable cases gave him, fame long before
his promotion to* the position which he
has just quitted, "it was largely due -to
his intelligent and zealous investigations
that the case against Theodore Durrant
was made so conclusive as to prevent- the
possibility of a miscarriage of justice.
Other notable cases in which he played a
prominent part were the murder of Mrs.
Clute, the Becker-Creegan gang of for
gers, who swindled the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank, and the Selby robbery. More
recently he has succeeded in developing
a strong circumstantial case against
Charles B. Hadley, accused of the murder
of Nora Fuller.
I have been considering this step for three
months and my only reason for resigning 'is
that I can better myself. I have 'had an offer
from the Fair estate which I think will be
pleasantcr and more lucrative than my present
position, and for that reason sjlely.I have
been led to sever my connection with the de
partment. I Long association with police meth
ods and policemen lends considerable regret to
an otherwise pleasant prospect. I am sorry
to leave my old comrades, and I am happy
to have the opportunity to express my regard
and appreciation of the men who have worked
with me and under me during, my career as a
police officer. . Â¦',Â¦Â¦*
After half an hour's conference with
Chief of Police Wittman he came into his
office and greeted the newspaper men.
saying: ..
To the Honorable the Board of Police Com
missioners of. the City and County of Ban Fran
ciÂ«co: I hereby tender to you my resignation
as captain of defectives and as a member or tne
Police Department of the city and county of
San Francisco, said resignation to take effect
June 1." In severing my connection with tnÂ«
department I desire -to offer my sincere thanks
to each and â¢ every member of the board for
the uniform kindness and courtesy shown me.
MUCH to the surprise , of the Po
t lice Department and the public
at large, Captain of Detectives
John F. Seymour resigned his
position yesterday morning.
The resignation, couqhed in the following
Â¦words, was handed to Secretary Cadwai
