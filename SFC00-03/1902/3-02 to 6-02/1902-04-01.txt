ST. JOHNS. N. ,F.. March 21.â Sealing
steamers which arrived here to-day bri.ijf
reports of s tempestuous weather and say
they have not seen or heard anything of
the missing Allan line steamer Huronian.
. It was thought by some persons that
this steamer. might have drifted north 'and
become enmeshed among the Ice 'floes arid
that the crew might have been rescued by '.-,
some sealing schooner. The absence of
news from the north makes it certain that
the Huronian is no longer afloat.

TUBA CITY, March 31.â Judge Davis
has filed his decision in the Superior Court
in the hydraulic* mining case of Sutler
County vs. William Johnson etal.,' mak
ing the injunction against the Polar Star
mine on the headwaters of Bear River
permanent.
This case was brought to test the Cam
inettl law' and the court holds that the
law is not absolute arid that ; thepermits
granted to hydraulic. minersby the Debris
Commission appointed under ' that : law aro
no bar to injunction suits when the debris
from the mines is injuring s the rivers
and valley lands, even though the miners
have constructed dams in accordance wJth
the plans and under the supervision of
the commission. The defendants alleged
that the courts had no jurisdiction.
White's appointment as Embassador
will be the capstone of his long diplomatic
; career. He received his first appointment
I in the diplomatic service in 1SS3, when he
was made secretary of the legation at
Vienna. He remained . there only; a few '
months and Â¦ was then transferred' to
London as second secretary of the lega
tion. He was promoted to the grade of
first secretary of legation in 18SC. He re
tired in 1893 and four years later was ap
pointed secretary of the" embassy In Lon
don.
White Is rich,, and it, Is believed will
make a favorable impression In Italy. It
will be the duty of '.White, to place the
United States Embassy upon a proper
footing immediately upon his arrival.
Meyer was rather. unfortunate because, of
reports regarding his peculiar character
istics'and of his efforts to secure the sec
ond secretaryship of the Embassy in
London, which reached the 'Italian Gov
ernment. He was unable to present his
credentials for a year -after his arrival,
and when he did so he was received on
somewhat humiliating terms.

Long haiVr<*reived from Captain Perry,
commanding the battleship Iowa, a reply
to . the department's inquiry regarding
certain alleged indiscreet remarks which
Â¦were reported to have been made by that
officer at a Chilean ifenquet. Captain
Perry declares that^whHe inChile he was
Â¦not' at sny time present at -any dinner,
breakfast, luncheon, supper or any-otbÂ«r
in^nl where any toast- or speech was made ;
by Mm or -others. Nor did he at ary
t:me say anything, cither in public or in
private, that could be construed to mean
that he favored either Argentine or Chile
in the event of war. The report, he says,
undoubtedly grew out of a visit 'of the in
tc-ndente of Concepcion to the Iowa, on
wt*ch occasion that official . was invited
!nto the cabin, where Perry offered him a
pJass of wine and said to him:
"Permit me. sir, to propose your good
health. The best wish I can offer you Is
tfcat peace may prevail In your country."
Captain Perry says that he Is as Inno
cent of making the alleged indiscreet re
marks as he Is of offering to sell the
Icwa. which was currently reported in
Chilean newspapers.
Secretary Long has replied to Captain
Perry, informing him that his explana

mine.
The two "firemen" to-day, who are sup
posed to have caused the explosion, were
Mark Hunter and John Harney. They
shot the blasts about 4:43 o'clock, before
all the miners could get out of the mine.
It Is supposed that one of the fuses was
defective and resulted In what Is known*
as a "blown blast."
TERRIFIC EXPLOSION.
The flame shooting out: from, the blast
ignited the gas. which in turn ignited tha
accumulation of dry coal dust In tho
mine. The explosion that followed was
terrific. The flames shot out of the mouth
of the mine, .and the shock completely
wrecked the shed at the mine entrance.
Three* men were killed while standing out
side the mine, and two were seriously and
one fatally injured.
This mine has been the scene of two se
rious explosions in the past. In 1SS3 four
men were killed and eight seriously in
jured by*a"n explosion of ga3.
December 12, 1S35, an explosion of mine
dust occurred in which twenty-eight lives
were lost. This was caused by a- mine*
carrying an open lamp, contrary to regu
lations. BmH
The force of the explosion In the Nel
son mine to-day was terrible. Bodies* wera
literally mangled and torn to pieces. Thi
company states that there were but sev*
enty-flvc men at work in the mine to-day.
Most of them were out of the mine when
the explosion occurred.

These proposals are less . liberal than

acceptable to this Government.
Senor Concha, the new Colombian Min
ister, accompanied by Herran, first secre
tary of the legation, and William Nelson
Cromwell, general counsel of Colombia,
called on Secretary Hay this afternoon
and presented, the proposals, which are
embodied . in a draft of a treaty. The
treaty provides for the lease of a strip of
territory six miles In width for a period
of one hundred years, with the privilege
of extension. The Isthmian Canal Com
slon recommended that the strip be ten
miles wide.
Secretary Hay will probably suggest
some changes. The proposals will be laid
before Congress in a few days. ;

the Secretary, cf W.ar.olecUned to have the
matter investigated.
Considerable surprise is expressed here
at Schalkburger's delay, in getting, in
touch with Dewet, and it is thought that
something unusual must be behind it.
But even if the Orange Free State and
the Transvaal officials agreed to peace
terms, it would be necessary for both re
publics to call a meeting of the com
manders and submit the proposals to the
burghers before they could be submitted
to Lord Kitchener. In any case uncon
ditional surrender, it, is declared, is out
of the question. .

Schalkburger had to apply to Lord
Kitchener for a safe conduct. '
Well informed people here say General
Schalkburger was evidently influenced by
the Teceiot of the' news of the result of
the Dutch note to- Great Britain on the
subject of peace in South Afrioa and other
dispatches sent him from here. It is

The report adds that ' we are bound to
care for our own people, but after review
ing the American sugar situation says:
It can work no injury to our Industry If we
make this small reduction in Cuhan sugars.
Th<? tnactasent cf this bill will not affect the
1-i'Otection of the sugar producers of the United
Slates. There 'is no reasonable pretense that
the same protection on other Cuban product*
will insure any other American Industry. Cuba,
does net come simply as a mendicant, nor
should ehe be treated as Buch. She offers a
good trade in return. This she is willins to
concede. Under the provisions of the bill we
should be able to double the amount* of cur
export trade with Cuba, which amounts to
S2S.0o0.000 more than that we obtained in the
last fiscal year.
In conclusion the report says:
It is- a happy circumstance that, without any
injury to our own industries, and without the
loss of anything except seven or eight million
dollars of revenue, which we do not need, we
ire s Me to txtend this relief to Cuba and at
the eame time get reciprocal trade relations

Cuba presents, the action of the committee is
in entire' accord with the reciprocity doctrine
or the Republican platform and the declara
tions cf President SIcKinley and President
Roosevelt.' I; Involves no proposed revision of
the tariff or -anything not entirely in harmony
with maintenance of the protective system.
Following the action of the Ways and
Means Committee, the Republican mem
bers who oppose the bill held a conference
in the committee-room of Representative
W. A. Smith of. Michigan. About thirty
members' were present, representing thii
various States interested in beet sugar
production. No formal action -was taken
but the discussion was on the line of con
tmuing the contest on the floor of the
House. It is expected, however, that the
opposition will be from members individ
ually, rather than from a compact â¢ and
organized opposition.
After the meeting it was decided by
those present that about thirty Republi
cans would speak and vote against, the'
bill. The "Ways and Means leaders feel
confident that the bill- will pass, probably
by Republican votes. In any event there
is said to be more than sufficient Demo
cratic support of the bill to offset the Re

voted for the bill. Two Republicansâ

on the reciprocity feature were made, but
by general consent the United States con
tract labor laws were Included with the

THE GBEAT SPRING MEDICINE.
MR. ALFRED BROUN,
A Pron-.i: eat and Popu'ar Citizin, Says t
"Af'er the Us: of Paine' $ Celery Compound
I am Now in the Best of Health."
The greatest of modern physicians, Pro-
fessor Edward E. Pbelps, M. D., LI-D.,
after years of long: practice and close
scientific study, gave to suffering- and dis-
eased men and women his marvelous, life-
giving prescription, with the conviction
and positive knowledge that It had pe-
culiar virtues and ample powers to cure,
after the terrible verdict "incurable" was
uttered by the medical practitioner.
Thousands of the strongest testimonials
from the best known and most retlabla
men and women of our country fully sus-
tain the claims made by Dr. Phelps re-
garding his incomparable Paine'a Celery
Compound.
One of the most convincing proofs fur- :
nished comes recently from a gentleman
i widely, known in the capital city of the
: Dominion of Canada. We refer to Mr. Al-
fred Brown, 91 O'Connor street, Ottawa.
Ont. Mr. Brown's letter fully demon-
strates the fact that the greatest sufferer
may cast off his or her burden of disease
and become well, strong and happy. It
proves, too, that the great medicine main-
tains more firmly than ever before its un-
rivaled place in the estimation of people of
wealth and social standing as well as with
the masses. Mr. Brown says:
"I acknowledge with thankfulness and -.
pleasure the fact that I have been cured
of a very painful illness of eight years*
standing by the use of Palne's Celery
Compound. I had, during the years of my
illness, tried almost all the advertised,
medicines without deriving any good re-
sults. I was also treated by several of
the best doctors of this city, hoping 1 to
find that one of them,- at least, would un-
derstand my case. .
"I was getting worse and was told I was
incurable. I was indeed In a critical con-
dition. I could not go from the house alone, j
as I was liable' to sudden collapse. I tried j
hospital treatment, but no relief or good
results came to me. I could not sleep;
anything that I ate increased my agonies;
I was extremely weak, restless, tired and
despondent; was obliged to walk about
with my hands pressed .firmly into my left
side to ease my pains; my feet and hands
were cold continually; had Inclination toi
vomit, had profuse, cold sweats, quick V
breathing and would be racked with pain \
for hours at a tinv*. N

SANTA ROSA, March 31.â The prelimin
ary examination of Peter L. Schlotter
bach, charged with having â¢ feloniously
attempted to induce Harry H. Churchill
to give false testimony In the Lowry will
case, , came up In Justice John ; Brown's
court this afternoon. Schlotterbach,* ah
attorney and capitalist of this city, was
Indicted by the late Grand Jury. He had
been an attorney In the Lowry will case,
representing the decedent's husband. Dr.
J. W. Lowry.
The first witness was H. H. Churchill,
who testified that Mrs. Lowry " had em
ployed him. to expert a ;?et of books In
whiclf she was interested and that he had
pertbrmed . a . number of other clerical
tasks for Mrs. Lowry before her death,"
live years ago. In April, 189", ( he had writ
ten a will for her. Hobert Crane and Dr.
R. Press Smith, both now dead, signed
the document as - witnesses in his / pres
ence. He then gave the will into Mrs.
Lowry's keeping.
Deputy County Clerk Fred G.. Nagle
testilied that the will had been filed for.
probate and produced what he said was
a true photograph of the document. .It
was shownto Witness Churchill and. was
declared by him to be a true' likeness.
After vigorous objections by the attor
neys, for Schlotterbach; the : . court ad
mitted the photograph- in evidence. ' '
Churchill was recalled to the. stand and
asked If he had ever had any talk with
the defendant about the will. ;. He said
that Schlotterbach,' who \ was ; his 'em
ployer, had asked him to come to his home
one evening* and that he had gone. Schlot
terbach there told the witness that he had
been accused of writing. the alleged willof
Mrs.', Lowry. â¢/ Schlotterbach; made 1 two
propositions to . him : " One .-that he > testify
that he had written the will Â¦ later., than
the dateit bore, and: that he had '.written
It as a "josh" and never intended;; It to
be filed; the second that he had given the
will to one of the heirs and that that was
all he knew about it. .Schlotterbach, said
the witness, told him that there would be
"a little money in it for both of them" and
mentioned something about $1000.Vi,; i
D.'.."W.'-Cozad testified that he had .been
approached by the defendant, who wanted j
him to Induce Churchill; to testify In the
Lowry case. that the alleged: will was not
genuine. '- Cozad said â¢ that ( he, ; in i company
with Marshal Holmes., had listened at. a
window of Schlotterbach's -', house - - and
overheard '- the Â¦ conversation > between , the
defendant and Churchill. ; . His statement
of what : passed '^between 1 : the '-two I men '.in
the house was^ similar, to that of Churchill.

. TUCSON, Ariz., March 31.â A round-up
of wild horses has begun in the Boboqua
varl country, southwest of Tucson, near
the Mexican line. Thesc^iorses have in
creased so rapidly of, late years that cat

.The cowboys are now engaged in roping
the stallions and bringing them into cor
rals, to be broken and shipped out of the
county. In this manner -the cattlemen
hope to stop the Increase of this wild
stock, which has proved so disastrous to
their ranges in past years. The bands
Â¦ of horses have., frequently stampeded,
great bunches of cattle which were being
rounded-up for -shipment. They move in
droves and sweep down from the moun
tains in such great number3 as to frighten
the cattle and threaten the lives- of cow
boys.
-In. some portions of the border country
sheep-raising has been resorted to as a
method of ridding the ranges of this wild
stock, as horses will not stay in the coun

Some. beautiful; stallions. have been las

LAWYER'S HONOR
ON THE SCALES
r. Speaking. of the ,, call of -Senator^ Hatina.
on the President and^the'formcr's request;
for_a pardon for Rathbone," the- Post> will
say: "It is.quite likely, of course, that ;
some consideration will be shown Reeves,
who - turned state's evidence, ''and - action
in his case may be expected soon after
General Wood's return to Cuba. The at
titude of the administration to\yard Rath
bone and Neely will, , however, be lirm.
General Wood has the power of pardon,
if he should choose to exercise it, I but
<his is not regarded as probable. It Is
said to be extremely doubtful whether the
President has the right to set aside the
Judgment of the Cuban court, for Cuba'
is a foreign country, although under, the .
nominal protection of the United Stales.
The same reasoning makes it extremely
Improbable that Congress would enact
to stand.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â The Post
to-morrow will say that Senator Hanna
purposes to introduce a bill which will
provide for the trial of Estes G. Rath
\bone, recently convicted : in ' Havana < in
connection with irregularities in the Cu
ban postal service, by an American court
and under American laws. The Senator,
says the Post, will say he believes . In
Rathbone's honesty, notwithstanding , : his
conviction, and declares that under our
laws evidence not admissible under, the
Cuban procedure will aid Rathbone.-
WASHINGTON. March 31.-Ef
forts are being made by the
friends of Estes. G. Rathbone
to secure a pardon for him
from the sentence of the Ha
vana court. Senator Hanna has request
ed the President to issue a pardon for
Rathbone, but this ths latter has declined
to do. The President, however, has prom
ised to send .for the papers : in the ' case
and have them thoroughly reviewed. It
is stated that unless he. finds something
radically wrong he will allow the verdict
okagway .papers contain long accounts
of the. finding of a great copper mine at
Valdes. The deposit Is said to be one of
the most .wonderful ever known. The ore

miles and is declared to be greater than
that of the Tread well, carrying four times
the gold and silver, values. -
>i. Twenty- five Japanese, who were,practi
cally driven out. of-.Atlin, were brought
down on the Amur. Â¦ They were taken
north as workmen, by R. D. Featherston
haugh.who attempted to read the riot act
to the body -of miners who waited upon
him with a polite request that the Japan
ese be withdrawn. The leader of the
deputation laughed at the Briton's action
and the ' next day the Japanese were
shipped' to 'the outside. , :~ -

Passengers relate 1 a story to the effect
that several months' ago Richard Fraz
ier, Dominion Government Surveyor, de- j
stroyed a' Russian boundary monument.
.The monument was of stone, resting upon
a stone base, and there was a Russian in
scription on it.. It was eighteen miles be
yond the modus. Vivendi line, on'the Can
adian side. In the presence of two Ainer
â¢ican miners, Frazier . ordered his men to
destroy the monument. It was torn down,
broken into small pieces and covered with
sand and gravel. Â»
News was brought of an accident at
Juneau last Friday night on board the
Â¦. steamship City of Topeka. The vessel
was discharging coal, when her machinery
"caught and the coal bucket was swung
away into the air .over the end of the
yardarm. The wire cable snapped and its
loose 'end whipped down into the hold
with terrific force. One man was fatally
injured and died the same night in the
hospital and a second was seriously hurt
and may not live. Two other men stand
ing near by were injured by pieces of coal..
A slight shock of earthquake was re
corded, at- Skagway. on the 24th, but no
damage, was done. Travel down the river
is very heavy and people are "waiting their
turn at White Horse on the one stage a

golians found the route through Brltisn
Columbia and Canada, the entire north
ern lrontier had to be policed with cus

As long as the ruling was that the Mon

I tnree or four to watch the .entire line
between the Pacific Coast and the Colo

to get in. However, when the difficulty
was pointed out to the department and the
Chinese were no longer permitted to
transfer from one steamer to another in
San Francisco harbor "en route to Mexi
co" the scheme was effectually broken
up. -' .
Now comes this concession for a
steamer line to China without the neces

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CLARA, March 31.â Peter Jen
sen went to fill the place of his sick
brother at the mills of the Pacific Manu
facturing Company this morning. Before
his first day's work was ended he lay
mangled and bleeding beneath a pile of
heavy timbers, his skull crushed and life
almost extinct.
Jensen is a Dane, 32 years of age, and
a man of great strength. Being inex
perienced he overloaded a car with lum
ber and In entering the mills it was over
turned. Jensen was on the right side, he
and his fellow workman forcing the car
along by placing their shoulders against
the load. The track slightly curves at the
doorway. Here it was tiiat the accident
occurred. "
It was just before 5 o'clock and in a
few minutes nearly all of the 200 em?
ployes of the big establishment were on
the scene. They lifted tne big timbers
from the prostrate man and carried him
into one of the shipping rooms. There the
injured man lies to-night, surrounded by
a dozen of his fellows, only his -superb
strength and wonderful vitality keeping
him alive. The physicians . declared he
could not live fifteen minutes. The skull
is fractured in two places, one of the ar
teries on the left side of the neck is sev
ered and cerebral hemorrhage is certain.
The physicians now say he may live till
morning.
Jensen is an Odd Fellow and a commit
tee from local lodges will have him- re
moved to a sanitarium in San Jose. He
Is unmarried.

Park Commission Blames Rail

. ~ ing Music. -
Mayor Schmitz sent to the Board cf
Supervisors yesterday his veto of tha
resolution confirming the appointment ot
George 8. McComb to be Justices' clerk.
After the veto was read at the board's
session Braunhart moved its reference to
the Judiciary Committee to determine it
the Mayor has the right to v^to such a
resolution, and the motion prevailed. The
'veto message, which contains the reasons
for the Mayor's disapproval, follows:
Executive Department, Mayor's Office,
SAN FRANCISCO. March 31. 1903. _ ,
The Board of Supervisors^ â Gentlemen: I
return herewith, without my approval, resolu
tion No. 2476. appointing George S. McComO
Justices' clerk of the city and county of Saa
Francisco for the following reasons: â¢
The appointment is Injudicious and illogical.
"When ' I suspended Mr. Williams, the former
clerk, for neglect of duty and absence from
his Office, there were suspended with him, at
the same time, his deputies, among whom
was George McComb. Mr. McComb, while
denying continuous attendance at the race
track, openly and frankly admits absence front
the of Hce. I cannot, by my approval, con
firm-the selection of a delinquent deputy to
succeed a delinquent principal. If there ia
to be a restoration of former conditions, it
will not be through any act of mine.
Moreover, the confirmation ot Mr. McComb
would be but a -warrant of appreciation of the.
none too commendable conduct of the Justices
of the Peace, who, in their allegiance to their
political "organization" have steadfastly de
clined to consider any perron as a possible ap
pointee unless by long service and association
he has proven himself a seasoned member of
the "machine."
As to the right of the Board of Supervisors*
to appoint a Justices' clerk at all, in. the race
of the express provisions of the charter, tbia
is a question of law now being adjudicated by
the courts, and I do not, therefore, consider
it proper to base any objections on the legal
propositions involved. Respectfully submitted,
E. E. SCHMITZ, â¢
Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco.
The Park Commission sent a communi
cation in answer to a resolution regard
ing the discontinuance of music in Golden '
Gate Park. The commission states that
the fault lies with the street car compa
nies, which enjoy valuable franchises for",
the transport of people to the park, for
which they pay the city nothing. Tha
communication continues: . â¢â
In view of the fact that the Park Commis
sioners have expended large sums of the peo
ple's meney to make the park attractive and
that no one receives any money for it- except
the railroads, and also that a music stand has
been given by a public-spirited citizen to af
ford greater facilities for the- presentation ot
music, we think that they should at least pay
for the. entertainment of those who patronize
their roads to and from the park. It seems
to us that a more liberal policy- will be pur
sued by the new corporation actually in con
trol of nearly all the street car lines/ and that
it will furnish the entire sum required for the
music. To bring about this hoped for result
our chairman. has been appointed by this board
to act with his Honor tho Mayor on the
matter.. /;<,-â¢';; i->'^.^ .. Â¦.,..-.,:.Â»
McCOSCB CITES FREDRICK
TO APPEAR HT COTJBT
Mayor's Appointee must Sho-w Causo
Why He Should Not Be Ousted
From Office.
George S. McComb is making a deter
mined effort to secure the position of Jus
tice's â¢ Clerk, to which position he was
appointed -.by the Justices of the Peace
on the 24 th of last month. So far .his
battle has' availed him naught, butf Iat3
yesterday afternoon he" commenced an ac-,.
tlon -by .1 which ."he hopes - to - oust Poweli
Fredrick- from . the much-coveted â¢ Â¦ ofiicc.
He filed a petition for an order directing
Fredrick to appear before the Superior
Court and show cause why he should not
give up the position of Justice's Clerk/
which he has held ever since the Mayor'
ordered the dismissal of E. "W. Williams.
The order petitioned ' for was issued by
Judge Cook, who directed Fredrick to ap
pear before Judge Sloss on April 3 and
show cause why he' still continues in the
office of Justice's Clerk, despite the ap
pointment of McComb to the place.
This Is a special action and is taken by
McComb because Judge Sloss yesterday
refused him an injunction restraining tho
Mayor from taking any action on his
case. The action fs brought under the
provision of section 1015 of -the- Political
Code, which provides that "to- the event
of a dispute between* an incumbent in- an
office and his predecessor, the former can
appeal to the courts for an order which
will bring .the dispute before a court for
final determination. â : '*'Â¦'.Â¦ -p* -â¢; Â¦ -- -. , ..,; .%,#Â¦
McComb claims that heist the incumbent
by. right: of the appointment. made by .the
Justices* of .-the. Peace last : month, â¢Â¦ not
withstandlngr'that the /Mayor has refused
to ' approve bfs ,bofld. Â«>â¢ Â¦": <Â¦ â¢â¢;-.-Â¦ . ' ' ' Â¦Â¦: . Â¦> .Â« â¢. . .
'The -section 'under which the action IS
brought provides that the Superior Court
has the power. to take summary action,
which means that the court can direct the
Sheriff to seize and hold the books an<l
effects of the office until such time as tha
rightful and legal Incumbency is deter
mined. The code also provides for the '
prosecution on a charge of misdemeanor
of the party, who willfully holds tho
office.
McComb opened an office for the trans
action of business yesterday at the City
Hall. The room formerly used by Judge
Sloss as a jury-room > was set apart for
his use. ' '>

Lombard-Street Wharf Unsafe.
. The Harbor Commissioners have discovered
that Lombard-street wharf is unsafe. The-offl
cers of the battleship Oregon found this out just
four years ago. The Commissioners will take
up the matter at .. to-morrow's ": meeting. â¢ The
steamship Meteor docked at the wharf on Sun
day and commenced discharging herl cargo of
lime. When 0000 barrels had been placed on
the wharf if began to settle. Discharging was
suspended _and the Meteor was given another
berth, while stationed : here four 'years' ago
prior to making her famous voyage from Paciflc
to Atlantic, the Oregon's crew was regularly
drilled on Lombard-street wharf. . These drills
toward the end were cut down considerably
owing to the fact that under, the strain of some
of the more vigorous setting-up exercises . the
docked rocked and swayed like a ship at sea.
Drilling on Lombard-street wharf was finally
stopped owing to Its shaky condition. The Com
missioners will discuss to-morrow : the advisa
bility of building a new wharf on the site- of
the present structure.
The university skeleton was the only
one available, and a requlsition^for â¢ the
use of it was made upon the university
management. The class in anatomy was
wiping- to release its subject for a- few
hours, and. after the club had put up $100
cash, to.be forfeited should the- precious
relic stray away, the human frame passed
aw ay.. over. the campus. in- the direction-of
town. -It. was locked up in a room," and
those who placed It there went to bed to
have nightmares. â¢ , .. â¢ ,.
â¢In the morning a Bearch' was made for
the skeleton, but. it- was missing. Some
of the superstitious ascribed its depar
ture to supernatural. agencies, Â¦ but' the
more sagacious laid it at the door of the
falgma Alpha, a rival organization. .And
now there is the deuce- to pay. -The unl-"
versity people want their, skeleton, and
?n ant I* b l dl i'- The T. H. P. o.'s want
their hundred dollars back. The stories
of the hardships endured by some Â« of
those who contributed to the. bail'fund
would give the blush to . the sufferings
experienced by . the Donner Lake party or
the mutineers of the Bounty. Several
debonair, young men, it is said, have
been forced to pawn their military hair
iÂ« ,fi 3 s t( > meet the requirements of the
landlady. General demoralization prevail*

rates or cowboys.
It happened one day last week that
some of the members desired photographs
taken. With ordinary mortals the wish
would have been father to the deed and
tintypes would have been turned out with
out delay." Not so with the T.'H. P. O.
It is an unwritten law of this -sinister
organization that failure of a member to
have his face reproduced -except in com
pany with a: skeleton, or something as j
terrible, is punishable by death at the

MISSION CLTJB DELEGATES
HAVE TALK WITH "MAYOR
Strongly Urge Removal of Colonel
George Mendell From. Board
of Public Works.
The committee recently appointed by the
Federation of Mission Improvement
L'luos, consisting of Gustave Schnee.Max
Popper, A. S. LJUie. W. E. Cole and \V.
B. Dubols, called on Mayor Schmitz yes
terday to urge a change in the personnel
uf the Board of Public Works. The com
mittee was appointed some months ago,
but yesterday was the first opportunity
the members had to meet with the Mayor.
The members of the committee urged
Immediate action in the removal of the
present board, their objections being that
Colonel Mendell, by reason of his ago
ivas unable to properly discharge the du
ties cf the office and that the board was
L'oniucted in a most extravagant man
ner.- The actions of the Board of Health
were also brought up and discussed. Other
matters of interest to the people of the
Mission district were informally dis
cussed.
Mayor Schmitz said he was giving thor
ough consideration to all matters affecting
the city's finances and the conduct of the
various appointive boards, but would not
act hastily. .-,â¢Â¦â¢-. . Â¦ â¢" Â¦Â»;-.
"When I am convinced that something
Is wrong I will act very promptly." he
said. "I have had this matter under con
sideration for some time, but am not pre
pared -*t this time to make known what
my actions in the premises will be."
exchanged in the last few days in re
gard to this matter between Secretary
John L. Brundage of the Kern County
Beard of Trade and Manager Filcher of
the State Board of Trade. Mr. Brundase
wi&hes to have the Bakersfield committee
meet the representatives of all the com
mercial organizations of San Francisco
and wrote to Manager Filcher to see what
arrangements could be made to meet peo
ple who are acting as directors of the
several boards, of the Merchants' Associ
ation, the Chamber of Commerce, the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, the Board of Trade of San Francisco
and the State Board of Trade.
Secretary King of the Merchants' Asso
ciation has agreed to try to have repre
sentatives of the Merchants' Association
meet the Kern County delegate this after
noon or to-morrow. The trustees of the
San Francisco Board of Trade and of the
. State Board of Trade will meet to-day.
In the correspondence Secretary Brundage
has made the statement that the Los
Angeles business men have agreed to have
a Los Angeles day at the carnival. The
argument that the delegation will use is
that this city has an equal Interest in
Bakersfield with Los Angeles, and that
while the competition between Los An
geles and San Francisco for the trade
of the head of the San Joaquin Valley is
so sharp, it is certainly to the advantage
of San Francisco to show that it is con
cerned in the welfare of Bakersfield.
A committee representing the Board of
Trade of Kern County left Bakersfield
for this city yesterday and will arrive
htre this morning for the purpose of en
iistins' the interest of the merchants and
manufacturers of this city in the project
of having a San Francisco day at the
carnival and street fair to take place in
Bfakersfield from May 3 to May 10, In

Compound. Read Her Letter.
''Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I wish to thank you for the benefil
medicine has done me ; I cannot speak too highly in praise o{
it. /After^my child was -born ""I was left in a very bad condition. 1
flowed three .weeks out of the month; I suffered for months, and
finally consulted three physicians. Two of them said I had a tumor,
and the ? third one said I was going into consumption. I was sick
and tired, 'andcould not perform my household duties. Finally a friend
urged'rmf to try IjydiaE. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
Â¦ 1 really',- had iio faith in it, although I had often heard of its wonderful^
cures ;but,the fact- was I: had no faith or interest in anything any
Vrnbre. -I^finally decided to try it ; after the first bottle I felt im-
mensely "better, and after taking the sixth bottle I was entirely
cured, and;felt like a new-woman. I consider it woman's friend, and
would. ne\ r erbe withoutiit in the house. O, what a lot of* misery and
sufferingTcpuld be avoided if all women' only knew of the wonderful
.power of: LydiaE. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound to cure theirills."

challenge, but of course we cannot accept until Can

For more than , a week preceding Easter the
weather of the East/had been unusually stormy and
.severe. Reports from New York City-told of. great
windstorms around that region, during which homes,
barns and churches were 'blown down, cattle killed
and many persons injured by the. falling walls ; of
buildings. From the Mississippi Valley and from the
Southern States reports came of rising rivers, farms
and .towns, swept by swift; rushing. .waters an^rnany,

EASTER, which dawned over California so
brightly and gave us a day to be remembered
for its serene beauty, came to the people on the ;
wrong side of the Rockies with about every form of
storm that is known to the Weather Bureau. The.
old proverb that if March come in like a lion if will
go out like a lamb .was' refuted this year in that sec
tion, of the Union. Coming in like a lion raging for
destruction, the whole month poured down upon the
East torrents of rain that flooded wide regions of
"country irom Maine to Louisiana and lashed the
waters by v/inds that in many cases amounted to ter
rific tempests. Not a* week went by without bringing
a report of some catastrophe caused by Â¦ floods or
winds, and Easter, Suuday became a day of something
like terror by reason -of the fearful disasters that took
place in so many, houses of worship while the services

SEWER ASSESSMENTâ Sub., Vallejo,
Cal.. Unless a city, as such, makes sewer
improvements it cannot have property
sold for delinquent assessment and give
a title through a court to the property.
It is the usual custom for a city to let a
contract, and the value of the work per
formed becomes a Hen on the property,
and if not paid the contractor commences
an action in a court of competent juris
diction, and a deed issued upon judgment
in the case is valid, provided all. the requi
site conditions by the contractor have
been complied with.
Discussing municipal government in New York
Bishop Potter said recently thai. at one city election
he made an inquiry and found that along both sides
of Fifth avenue from Washington Square to Central
Park only thirty-eight residents remained at' home to
vote. The rest had gone off for some kind of amuse
ment. San Francisco' hardly makes a better show
ing of public spirit, and it is time for prominent citi
zens to', start a reform, movement .among themselves.
j RESIDENCEâ Subscriber, Cloverdale,
Cal. A man may have a h6use that is
part in one county and part in the ad
joining county, but he cannot claim a
legal residence in two counties at one
and the same time. If he does not want
.to move the house, .which, as in the case
cited, is standing across the county line, he
would have to make his home on -either
side of the county line and claim resi
dence in the county chosen.'
In vain the Frenchman explained that

from his pen and would have' It framed
for hanging on the wall of the dining
room. As he explained he kept on draw-
Ing,- until the head waiter could stand it
no longer and had him deposited on the
sidewalk. *Â¦. , -
The Frenchman was. sadly offended. In
deed, if the whole troth was told, he wa3
angry, as angry as he had ever been In
his life. He crossed Fifth avenue at the
risk of bein^ run down by the stream of
cabs. When he was safe on the opposite
curb he turned and faced the hotel. H13
rage hardly permitted him to speak, but
at last he succeeded.

the artist, continuing to make llnea.
"I tell you to stop spoiling the table
cloth," repeated the head waiter.
. "You must not mark up the linen." said
the "lord of the dining-room. "It is
against the rules."
He dined alone one evening at the Hol
land House. .and he was well pleased with
his dinner. While lingering over a cordial
he decided to 3how his approval of- the
meal and service by drawing ah elaborate
sketch on the immaculate linen cloth
which covered the table. A waiter dis
covered him and protested "mildly. The
Frenchman waved him to one side and
continued to draw. It was a Paris cafe
scene .which he was iLtims, and he was
interested.* The waiter went to the head
waiter and complained that the artist was
spoiling the table cloth.

be told, though the artist must remain

THE WOODWARD BROTHERSâ
Point Arena, Cal. One of the two Wood
ward brothers who shot and killed Sheriff
Ricker of Casper, Wyo., is named Charles
and his brother is named Harry.
The story is an old one, but it can never be repeat
ed too often so long as good men neglect their po
litical duties. The San Jose example should be a
warning to San Francisco, and to the State at large.
Over and over again, with each succeeding elec
tion, an opportunity is offered to the better elements
of the people to elect competent men to office, but
again and again the registration reports show that
thousands are indifferent to the right of suffrage, and
when the votes are counted after election the results
show that those who neglected to register were not
those who make up the gangs of the bosses.
Th-e example of these negligent citizens of San
Jose comes as a timely warning to the people of
other cities of California. There are a good many
elections of one kind or another to be held this
year, and for every on6 of them registration is neces
sary. The citizen who does not register cannot vote,
and he who cannot .vote counts for nothing at the
polls. He is a political nullity in his community, no
matter how prominent he may be in trade., the pro
fessions or in society. This is a government by vot
ers and not by dignitaries, and from a political stand
point no man counts as a good citizen, or even as a
citizen at all, unless he. registers.
When election day comes the bosses will round
their gangs to the polls without missing a single vote,
iut the leaders who 2re striving for honest govern
ment will find many a good citizen lamenting that he
cannot respond to the appeals made to him, and
mourning that he cannot cast a vote for honesty be
cause he neglected to register. 'Then if the gangs
carry the day and a corrupt government be imposed
upon the city the negligent ones will be heard criti
cizing, croaking, growling and complaining about
boss rule. Having made no effort to save the city
from such domination they will quiet "their, con
sciences by talking loudly of reform and good gov
ernment.
That the corrupt or corruptible elements of the
voting population have registered goes without say
ing. To them an election is a matter of business.
They have bosse's to serve and schemes to support,
and they are duly sent to the registration office so
that none may fail 011 election day. To the. better
elements of the people a city election is also a matter
of business, and of very business at that,
but they do not deem it so. It is apparently to them
a trouble and a vexation. They prefer to have noth
ing to do with it. They do not register.
The reports from which these conclusions are
drawn are not the Reports of critics, nor of reformers.
They come from the registration office. A city elec
tion is soon to take place in San Jose and those who
wish to vote and have a voice in determining who
shall administer the ? flairs of the municipality must
register. The report says: "There are about 5500
voters in the city limits, and although registration
for the city election, which occurs May 19, has been
in progress about two months, only 3500 voters have
registered. This leaves at least 2000 yet to register."
CITIZENS of San Jose have a beautiful city
to be proud of. if they would govern it right
ly, and a golden future immediately before
them, if they would make good use of the opportuni
ties of the present. It is in their power not only to
advance their own interests and the welfare of the
city, but to set a good example of civic patriotism
and energy- that would benefit the entire State. It
appears, however, from reports that a considerable
mumber of them have r.o such patriotism, but are in
different alike to needs of the present and the promise
cf the future. While they may be proud 'of their
city, they ere not- ambitious to make the; city proud
of them, and instead of setting a good example to
citizens of other places they prefer to be pointed to
fcs a warning.

PERSONAL MENTION.
SOME ANSWERS
TO QUERIES BY
CALL READERS
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
The issue applies to all men in the North/ and it
is a melancholy spectacle to. see Northern Democrats
with; faces shining with pleasure x in apparent enjoy
ment of being reduced from equal citizenship and
shorn of their, equality ,'as citizens. It'was hoped that
the Northern "dough -face" had ceased to appear in
ouf politics. / . vv ' v ' _; . ' : . ' /
Â§ The Crumpacker resolution may not pass now.
The issue; may not be joined. But when all the
Northern people have a chance to understand! that
"the Southland" is enjoying representation based on
a negro population that, is forbidden. to yotey and that
the constitution requites that the ballot and the ap
portionment shall go together, then such a resolution
will pass, for the. North has too much, self-respect to
accept the degradation of such inequality.
Go on leaping; no one wants -to stop you, Mr.
Bellamy. Btit you can't deprive nearly half your
population of representation and continue to count
it in the basis of representation, because that is ; for
bidden by the constitution. Â¦ ' â¢
Mr. Bellamy continued: "Right here, in passing,
let me say if we are not disturbed in the peace and
security that now prevail and never through negro
domination again have our treasury squandered and
our taxes made more burdensome than we can bear
and bur- people become, demoralized, that we will leap
rapidly to the front and become the greatest manu
facturing State; in the Union." , < ;.Â¦ Â¦Â¦'. ;-.;',-> Â¦. :
If it is sectionalism for the North to insist upon its
equal rights, so be it. It does not propose to take
from the South a single right that belongs* to it un
der the: constitution. It could not do so if it wished.
But the South proposes to hold on to a right of
which the? constitution specifically deprives .it. and
the unconstitutional enjoyment of which degrades the
equality of the North.
Now all that is very fine, but it does not touch the
issue. The constitution says that the much dreaded
black cloud is the sols condition upon. which negroes
shall be counted in the basis of representation; when
"the sunlight of hope" gets into business it transacts
withythe cloud and the apportionment at the same
time. If only white men are permitted to vote in the
Southland, then only white men can be counted in
the basis of representation. The; North proposes '.no
interference in the domestic concerns of the South,
but it docs propose to take car\ of its own interests,
which depend upon its equality in this Government.
Â¦ The, position of the Southland is the grossest, most
despicable and sinister interference in the domestic
concerns of the North. It is a denial to every North
ern-man of his proper constitutional equality; with
every Southern man. This cannot be obscured by all
the tropes and metaphors '. and hypocritical heroics
that can load the air with sound in that section.. V
Mr. Bellamy of North Carolina, wHile discussing
the river and harbor.billin the House, and, charac
teristically, trying to increase the appropriations
therein for his State, took occasion to discuss the
negro question. It is interesting that .he, like all of
them, admits, unconscious that it â¢_ closes their case
adversely, that their new franchise 'laws, are for the
express purpose of depriving negroes of the ballot.
He is quoted in the Record as saying: "For nearly
a third of a century a "black cloud, the menace of
negro domination, has been hovering over the South.
And just at this period, when we are about to peace
fully "settle the racial question, when peace and con
tentment are , prevailing throughout the Southland,
when our people had begun to study the great eco
nomic questions of this country rather than partisan
politics, when the sunlight of hope had begun to
disperse forever that black cloud and solve the race
question peacefully forever, we are startled and
awakened by another effort to interfere in our do
mestic concerns, stir up sectional strife and bitter
ness, and tear the gaping wound afresh."
IT is both amusing and .amazing to read the ex
pressions of some of the Southern Congressmen
upon the proposition to investigate the basis; of
representation in that section. They treat it as no
body's business whether they have fifty or sixty more
Representatives . and more electoral votes than they
are entitled to under the constitution. If they have been;
so ingenious in eliminating the fc negro vote that it
will stand judicial tests, that is their- business. But
the constitution says that when the negro voter is
denied that right all negroes shall be removed from
the basis of representation, and that is the business of
the whole country. The South again desires to; be
let alone while it treats the negro as unfit for repre
sentation in the Government, but uses "him to in
crease its representation in the Government. That is
the question, and the only question, involved. ,
THE SOUTH- AND THE NEGRO.
THIS IS THE GOI^ BRACELET PRESENTED TO MISS ROOSEVELT BY PRINCE^HENBT AS I A GOT^FROM THE
We have been told that : the organization of' self
governing; municipalities is progressing rapidly; . in
the Philippines, but the Manila Critic reports that
the other day 'Goyernor^Johnson-of the province of
Isabella sent! word to the various' "presidentes":
"You will please have the municipal council pass at
once an ordinance prescribing the attendance on all
days of study at some public' school of all children
between the- ages of seven and fifteen who are not
enrolled within some private school." Whether .it
be wise to force education upon a people who do not
wish it is a. question, butthe power. of a Governor to
command a municipality to enact any ordinance he
desires is certainly not' American.
The latest that has come under our observation- is
an Eastern magazine article on irrigation, written by
Colonel Chitttnden. Searching for a figure to char
acterize the impolicy of opposing irrigation because
of the land it would bring into action! he says: "We
might as well object to the vast fruit production of
Southern California." This carries the impression
that Northern California produces no fruit. . Â«As a
matter of fact, of the-83,729 ten-ton carloads of fruit
and fruit products â¢exported by this State last year
48,450 carloads were from Northern and 35,279 from
Southern California. But of the Southern export
30,298 carloads were citrus fruits, leaving only 4981
carloads of miscellaneous fruits. Orange culture in
Northern California covers. a vast stretch of country
from Porterville to Oroville, but i& in its infancy, so
that Northern California exported only 2088 carloads;
but she sent to market 46,362 carloads of miscella
neous fruits. It is evident, then, that Colonel Chit
tenden'should have said "the fruits of California,"
and refrained from an incorrect division of the State.
Northern California simply has her eggs in more bas
kets than Southern California and that means a va
ried and profit-promising basis for her prosperity.
This State long ago passed into a figure of speech.
One of the Prime Ministers of Great Britain, deliver
ing the address as Lord Rector of Edinburgh Univer
sity, desired to find a materiaPantithesis to illustrate
the value of education, and he said: "In .place of
education, if offered the wealth of California, which
should be chosen?" \^w -. â¢
,Lef us extend the monopoly of Southern California
enterprise until, like a beneficent octopus, it grasps
the whole State. Then real knowledge of California
will be spread abroad. We want to get, the whole
conTmon wealth into literature. Italy enjoys her pres
ent profitable reputation because from ancient days
until now her clement climate, her sunny skies, her
olives, oranges and vines have been in literature. She
was accessible from the damp and foggy climate o,f
the British Isles and from' cold Northern Europe,
and their poets have srng and their artists have paint
ed.the charms of Italy for fifteen hundred years. Now
the harp and the brush are celebrating California,
and it, is well. But,,_tt:rning to the present day and
practical* side of it,~ the yivrong impressions that are
abroad should be corrected.
Everybody gees, or wants to go, to Southern Cali
fornia. The stream of winter travel there has grown
to be a flood, which overruns the capacity of hotels
farter than they can be built, and no, one ever heard
of a visitor that^escaped the enchantment of that sec
tion of the State; Under .such circumstances it is no
wonder that hundreds of thousands of people think
that, having seen Southern California, they have seen
all there is of the State. It is true that having seen
that they have seen more that is enjoyable, charming,
conducive to pleasure and useful to jaded nerves and
wheels run down than can be found* in any other
country in the world, but they have seen only a small
part of it and only a fraction of California.
An exploration of the whole State would .show
them it enjoys a common climate and a community
of productions throughout its whole length. South
ern. California has had a 'monopoly, however, albeit
not of physical. conditions. These are" not due., to
man and he deserves* no credit for their ,-existence.
The monopoly of the south is to the credit of her
people/ They created it and deserve to enjoy its
fruits. It is a monopoly of enterprise, a monopoly
of a common purpose, promoted by a common en
ergy. In this the>\ are deserving of all praise and
our sincerest flattery of their achievements is in the
form of our determination to imitate them. They
know what they want and/ they seek it in company.
When a rope has to be pulled on, they all pull.% One
does not take hold and. cry, "Yo heave ho!" arid all
the rest cut his line or try to beat his hands until
they drop it. All take hold and they raise such a
chorus of "Yo heave Ko!" that it has come to be
heard ground the world. ; .'â¢,-
Sojourhcirs^ in; San Francisco' in the summer,- who
have come by steamer from the north and departed
by the same means for the south, have tales to tell
about the cold July here, the brisk winds, the sealskin
coats and parasols carried by the ladies in midsum
mer; and, by comparison, of the clement weather and
caressing zephyrs of; the 1 south. "Whereupon they
proceed - to conclude that Northern California is
touched, by the. polar isotherm, while the southern
part pi the State enjoys a. northerly curve in the equa
tor." ':'Â¦ Â¦ _"Â¦;.Â¦ '."'.â¢ Â¦ .' - Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦

versity of California nine went to the bat
and won the game for his team. He
circled the bags and the San Francisco
team had to be satisfied- with the small
end of a 7 to 8 score.
Braly' s run was made on an error by
Lawlor, who let the swift, low ball slide
through his hands out in center . field.
Braly himself had made three serious
errors, which had. caused, the San Fran
cisco score to go up, but his home run
redeemed his bad. playing In the early
part of the game. â¢
Kane, who pitched for the visiting team
during the first few innings, was easy- to
find and Whalen took his place with bet
ter success. The game was full of ex
citing plays. It ended with the college
boys in jubilant spirits, for the van
quished team defeated Stanford last week
by a score of 13-3. . r :^V"

way of class, at the same time
furnishing, one of the prettiest finishes of
a fortnight. It resulted in MacGyle, a
practically neglected . 10 ' to 1 shot, ably
ridden by Ransch, getting the verdict
from Rio Shannon by a nose, with Posi
tion, the* heavily played second choice,
finishing at Rio Shannon's saddle skirts.
Fauritleroy, on Rio Shannon, carrying 105
pounds, cut out the pace and had Ransch
not squeezed through a very small space
next the rail with MacGyle, Jimmy Cof
fey's horse would have won. Lee Jack
son astride Janice, the 8 to 5 favorite, got
cut off early in the game, and thereafter
found himself in a pocket from j which he
apparently found it impossible to extri
cate himself. After the . race Charles
Boots, owner of the winner, gave it as his
opinion that Lee Jackson had not han
dled MacGyle to the best of his ability
when the Brutus gelding was beaten in a
.race some days ago by Dr. Bernays.
Green Morris Became very wrathy at the
aspersions cast â¢ on the honesty, of his
young Jockey and laid the matter before
the, stewards. Unless the accusations are
substantiated by facts Owner Morris, .it
Is said, threatens to sue the proprietor
of Elmwood farm for libeling jacKson.
Although the weather looked threaten
ing an unusually large crowd viewed the
sport. There were no startling reversals
of I form, with the favorites making a
"stand-off" by capturing three purses.'
Windward, with Lee Jackson in the
saddle and second choice in the betting,
was the tip for the opening mile and fifty
yard selling run. Jackson waited with
his mount behind Fridolin, the favorite,
and the outsider Captivate until the
stretch was reached. Then he sat down
to ride, and catching Fridolin all out the
final fifty yards, won by- a neck. Capti-.
vate was thir,d.
Jackson followed this first win up by
capturing the two-year-old dash with
Lizzie Rice. The^ filly was backed down
in Â¦ the betting from 8 to 5 to G to 5, ; and
away first was never headed. Larry Daly,
down on the rail with Nigrette, came
very strong at the close, losing by a neck.
Maxette, a new one from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, ran a good third.
Heavily backed to take the third event,
asix-furlong selling affair, Evander.'with
Johnny Hoar up. nearly gave his backers
htart disease by. only beating Killdoe a
nose. After setting a merry clip out in
the lead.-E. M. Brattain ran' third.
W. W. Elliott's fast I mare, Miss Mae
Day, scampered home ahead v of a big
bunch of: sprinters in the five and a half
furlong number. Her odds were gradually
forced down from 8 to 5 to even money,
and she won all the way. Foucon brought
Sir Hampton along from far back, taking
the place from Narra G by a neck.-
Old Wolhurst was the pick of the inside
set to win the last race, at one mile and
fifty yards, and the veteran did the trick.
Jackson moved up with him by. degrees
from sixth position, scoring somewhat
easily at the wire from Marshal Neil, the
favorite. Gawaine ran third. . : â¢. \ . .

Corbett Will Be at Bingside.
JAMESTOWN, N. Y., March 31.â Jamei
J. Corbett will depart from Washington
on the night of April 13 for San Francisco.
Through his theatrical manager it Is
learned that Corbett Will be at the ring
side on the night of the battle of Jeffrie*
and Fitzsimmons and at the conclusion of
the fight will challenge the winner. 'This
action will take place providing that Cor
bett's previous proposition ' to take the
place of Fitzsimmons, if that pugilist de
clines to meet Jeffries, is not accepted.
The Board of Supervisors granted the
Yosemite Athletic Club permission yes
terday to hold a contest in April, and un
less the Superior Court intervenes ring
goers will have an opportunity of seeing
Joe Walcott and George Gardner . box
twenty rounds in Woodward's Pavilion
on the evening of April 25. The 1 National
Athletic Club is making a strenuous ef
fort to put pitfalls in the path of the Yo
semite Club, but Manager Corbett de
clares he will not tolerate Interference.
The men will fight at catchwelghts.
Walcott will enter the ring weighing 143
pounds. There being no ~ stipulated
weight, Gardner has the advantage,
bince coming to this city he has, like
other Eastern boxers, taken on weight.
When Gardner last met Walcott in this
city the colored man was given a decision
after twenty rounds' torrid fighting.
After the battle Gardner claimed he was
not fit. If there rs anything In "doping"
boxing contests Gardner should defeat
Walcott, as he easily defeated "Kid"
Carter, who beat Walcott and Joe Choyn
ski. Walcott, however, sometimes re
verses the order of things and there are
many who think the colored man will
beat Gardner in quick fashion this month.
On Thursday evening next the Ariel
Rowing Club will give a boxing entertain
ment in Woodward's Pavilion for the
benefit of its boathouse. "Billy" Leon
ard, champion feather-weight boxer of
the Olympic Club, is to meet Paul Mar
tin, the youth who made such a splendid
showing at the last tournament given -by
the Olympic Club. Teddy Wolff and
Charles Peterson will also uox four
rounds for a decision. There will be six
other bouts between the best amateurs in
town. a:.,' .â¢Â¦;Â¦
On the evening of April 11 the Acme
Athletic Club of Oakland will give a fine
exhibition. Manager Lavigne has
matched Eddie Hanlon and Frankie Neil
to box ten rounds and Dave Barry and
Harry Foley to go the same distance. Â¦ A
good preliminary bout will open the
night's entertainment.
"Kid" McPadden and "Spider" Welch
will meet in -the gymnasium, of the Reli
ance Athletic Club on the evening of
April S. This will be their, second tiglit.
Both men are in active training.
Billy Ryan Shows Superiority.
PHILADELPHIA. March 31. â Billy
Ryan of Syracuse had a shade the better
of his six-round bout with Tim Callahan
of this city to-night at the Washington
Sporting Club. The fight was a hard and
fast one. and Ryan surprised the specta
tors by his cleverness.
In the putting contest each competitor
putted eight balls from various points on
the circumference of the home: green.
Miss Sara Drum holed out two balls in
single strokes from the edge of the green
and required only seventeen strokes to
put all the eight balls Into the cup.; This
excellent performance gave her .the first
place. Â¦ - . . .
Six members 'of the Ladies* Annex of
the San Francisco Golf Club- entered a
competition In driving- and puttinj yes
terday on the Presidio links. In the driv
ing contest each competitor drove â¢ five

to-day, while I'nion Pacific, which reported a
handsome increase in February net earnings,
fell short of the cne-point advance and reacted
again .before the close. Rock Island's' 4 ; point

i CHICAGO. March, 31. â There " was good
strength in corn at the outset, due to the in
fluence of -the .cold -..weather West and South
west. This was a good excuse, to start cover-
Ing and buying, but the crowd which has bsen
active of late in a- bull deal in July options
Jumped Into the pit and sold 1. 000,000 bushels
of that delivery In -about ten, minutes. Specu
lators were staggered for a time' and all prices
lost in consequence. July lost 1 cent' to- 60%c
and May, - which j opened ,' % @ U c - tol &@%c*
higher at 60Â»Â£@!j0Â»4c, : slipped down 'Â¦ to -50^c.
It was thought that the bull crowd hadlnten-.
tlonally bid up the opening- prices, .preparatory,
to the heavy selling. After this break corn
seemed to be absorbed In a quiet manner,' and
It was supposed ' the â¢'. cereal .was: finding Â¦ its
v,ay back to its early : holders."- There 7 was a
disposition to cover on the "bull 'Seal" taifc;Jand
prices advanced ; -gradually.V- . The close -.was
firm, May - ifc@%c higher at- fiOt^C â¢ . ; .; , i
A natural . reaction . from Saturday's decline
and the effect jof .the corn, strength, --causetl

@71%c. Statistics, exceptthe increase on pass*
are, were bullish: Cold weather.Uhough light
ly spoken of, had: its effect- through corn. : ' ; The
early tone was almost .strong "and. was -aided
materially by commission house: buying.'.,-. AH'
this - show â¢ of Â¦& re\-ivlng .' market went . glim-'
merlngr, however, when corn broke l'cent.' Th-?
market was" very unsettled'.; and > May .reached
a new. low mark for â¢ the' .'Beasonrâ 70>4c.,.'<Late
in the day there was some* talk of crop'dam
age In the -Southwest, but most of the specu
lators were inclined Â¦' to ' treat- the argument
lightly. As corn recovered; scalpers took ad
vantage of the absence of a -selling pressure
in wheat to boost prices again, and May, rally
ing, closed unchanged at 71^@7Hio} " Â» Â¦ - ; -"Â¦Â¦
Oats were dull and almost featureless. The
.market was easy at times., but" much stronger
than the other grains. May closed firm vÂ«c
up, at 42c. ' "
.Provisions were Irregular. There was 'an
early strong feeling In the face of a weakpr
hog market, but it did not last long. Packers
bought freely after a slump and the markrt
closed steady. May pork and lard unchanged
and ribs 2^c higher. \
There will be no session of the board to
morrow â municipal elections.

The suit of the Bank - of California
against the city to recover |12,1$7 76 paid
under protest as taxes on the bank's fran
chise was argued before Judge Sloss yes-,
terday. It will be submitted on briefs.
Attorney John Garber, who appeared for
the plaintiff, raised the point that as there
are a number of private bankers doing
liusiness in this city who are not incor
porated and therefore do not pay any
franchise tax the levying of a tax on the
banks which have a franchise Is an in
justice. He pointed out the fact that the
bank owners pay a private tax and arc
assessed in addition for the privilege of
confluctlns business.

It was "folly night" at Golden . Gate
Hall last evening, because Golden GatÂ«J
Chapter, of the Order of the Eastern Star,
the mother chapter of the order, gave a
"folly party" there. The hall was prettily
decorated with festoons of various colors
and evergreens, and a counter effect was
produced by the display of many gro
tesque figures. Colored calcium lights
were also introduced during the dance*
to put the many maskers Into various
shades. There were more than three hun
dred in' mask and fancy costumes, anil
many of the latter "were very rich and
elegant. . '.:Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦',". 'Â¦Â¦
Â¦ mere were ladles and gentlemen !n
court dresses of the olden time, modern
swell3, policemen, "follies" of both sexes,
great dames and Red Cross nurses, Ru
bens from the country, but none of the
Weary Willie stamp; Chinese men and
women and Geisha girls, the clothespin
girl and many others, who made up a
very pleasing aggregation of costumes
suited to the idea of folly.
The grand march, which was viewed by
several hundred people In the gallery,
was led by Mrs. Mary Fahrenholtz, the
worthy matron of the chapter, attired, in
a rich Roman gown, and A. Robert, the
floor manager, who figured as a student,
with gown and mortar-board.
This party, exceedingly well gotten up
and carried out. was one of the most
pleasant social functions that this pro
gressive chapter has ever arranged for
its members and friends. It was under
the direction of Mrs. Katherine C. John
eon. Mrs. Clara S. Foltt, Mrs. A. S. Hub
bard, Mrs. A. Ferson. Miss Louise Stev

Sheriff Rogers' custody until District At
torney Allen has. decided what shall be
done with them. They are Inclosed In
sealed envelopes, but Devine has an inco
herent recollection of their contents.
This is not the first tragedy the old
pumping station, where the murder oc
curred, has witnessed. Less than two
years agoâ June 27, 1900â John W. White,
the pump tender, committed suicide in the
presence of O'Connor, who succeeded to
the suicide's vacant place. White had'
been there many years, but drink ?mas
tered him. One day in a fit of despond
ency he took strychnine while talking
with the man who lost his life there to
day. Before' relief could be given White
died, j Another life has now gone out at
that place of death.- 'Â¦: .
O'Connor's reputation . among the rail
road men. is good. He .has been section
foreman and roadmaster for many years,
both', on tho Southern Pacific and on the
Atlantic and Pacific roads.- The O'Connor
children -are Mrs. Minnie Fella, Southern
Pacific station agent at Frultvale; Pat
rick. Frank, Margaret, Joseph, Catherine,
Nellie, Charles, Vincent, Aloysius and
.William, the last named aged 9 years. -
Mentally Unbalanced for Years.

and, Devine intimately, having employed
them for years when he was roadmaster

SWaln siaid to-night: . .
Devine. In my opinion, Is' Insane. I knew
him. well twenty-five . years ago, when I was
v/lth the. railroad in Nevada. He has no ground
whatever for his grievance. Mrs. Devine is a
good, honest, upright woman. She struggled
as hard as he did in the., early days of rail
roading to bring up their^family. What pro
duced his hallucination I cannot imagine. >Â¦
- I well remember, when Devine went ' oft to
Ireland . fifteen years ago. He slipped ,away.
after drawing $3000 from the bank, and Was
having a good time. . Mrs.. Devine followed him
aevo.ss the ocean, - brought ' him to his , senses,
and he returned with her. . . Â¦
O'Connor: wasn't the kind of man to . ruin
any one's home. . He was under me for several
years on the old Shell Mound section. Â¦ Devine
iv as a splendidly Â¦ educated man, and he prld
t-d himself on the liberal' training he has given
his children. His wife Is as devoted a woman
to her family as a. wife and mother , could bo.
. For a number of years Devine has been
subject to : periodical spells of dementia.
His family has known of, his mental:dis
turbances, but has tried to keep his condi
tion ; a'i Â¦' secret among themselves. Such is
the information which "was | gleaned from
friends of the Devines. But none of them
had;believed that the trouble would reach
a serious stage, i * ' .' ; ~ " - '

O'Connor's head/the 6ther:one being lo

tragedy in any other way.. -
Such is the story of Thomas Devine In
his role of avenging husband. It is quite
a different explanation which comes from
the family of the murdered O'Connor. Tho
wife is prostrated with sorrow and there
are eleven children at the home, 5S79 Fre

PBESS CLUB TO GIVE
AN "APBIL FOOL" JIKJCS
Although It was rumored that some of
the clerks' salaries were being shortened,
it was not suspected for a single moment
that French was among the sufferers. It
Is known that It was chiefly due to
French's influence that Mahony received
the nomination for County I Clerk. Both
In the convention and after Mahony's
name was placed on the ticket French
worked Incessantly to have him elected,
and it was supposed that he would at
least treat French In a fair manner.
French's friends are very indignant over
the unfair manner in which he has been
treated, and some of them have gone so
far as to declare that they will call the
County Clerk personally to . account.
French subsequently denied that he had
made any such declaration, but admitted
that he -was not satisfied with the way in
which he was being treated.
All Is not.running smoothly In *C6unty
Clerk Mahony's ofnee, and there are ru
mors rife around the City Hall and In po
litical circles that there will be a startling
eruption in the near future. . It has been
confidentially whispered for some time
past among those who are In a position to
know that all of the clerks appointed by
Mahony are not drawing their full salaries
and that a portion of their pay 13' being
held back In order to pay political debts.
No definite charges, however, were made
until yesterday, when Chief Clerk Frank
French asserted in the presence of ex-
Assemblyman William Gullfoyle and J. B.
Bonner that $50 of his salary had been
taken from him. He declared that this
amount was added to the salary drawn
by William Deane, the former County
Clerk and at present a register clerk un
der Mahony. When French made this as
sertion he appeared to be very wroth at
the manner in which he was being treated
by Mahony, and is said to ha,ve threat
ened dire vengeance when he meets his
superior to-day. He declared to Guilfoyle
and Bonner that he was performing the
duties of chief clerk, while William
Deane was receiving the salary. French
declared further that he was not even al
lowed his salary warrant until he con
sented to the deduction in favor of Deane.

this morning I bought two pistols, loaded
them, and in my working clothes. Just as I am
now, - went to Shell Â¦ Mound. I had located
O'Connor at the pumping station . and wa3
ready to put an end to him.. 1 went down
to the beach, and at the water's edge-black
ened my face Â«o he would not recognize me.
Then I went- over to the tank. j: O'Connor- wan
behind a pile Of wood,, stooped over, cutting
with ftn ax. Twice I fired into his head, and
he dropped. I stood . there , ready . to ' put " a
bullet "into my own brains, when the men
came and stopped; me. ;~ Â¦ -.-.'Â¦Â¦-
There he lay, the destroyer of my happiness.
For thirty years he had been In my though tn
and now the time had come for me' to -settle
all (icores. He is dead? I am glad of it. â¢ t.r
â¢ Thirty-five years ago Kate Flynn and' my
Â»elf were married In New - York. â¢' I . was . then
a young man. she a girl of 22 years. .We came
West, and at last I settled on " the Central
Pacific, *orking on the road.. It was at Camp
20. seven miles from Boca,' that, I -met O'Con

â¢â¢Let some good brother see that: I am
cremated and my ashes scattered oft the
ferryboat between San Francisco: and
Oakland," wrote Devine to his lodge.
Devine made the following statement:
Blackened Face as Disguise.
From faraway Edgwood, in. the heart
of Siskiyou, came Devine Sunday on mur
der bent. A tall,' muscular, hardy man
is he, carrying his sixty years firmly.
Clad in his working . garments he left
home, telling his. wife and his daughters
Josie and Kittle he was going to Slsson
to have an aching tooth extracted. In
stead, he borrowed $60 from Harry Pat
terson, an. Edgwood hotel-keeper, and
boarded the southbound train, arriving
bunday. evening at . San Francisco. <; Stop
ping over night at the Cosmopolitan Ho
tel. Devine made preparations for his
crime. 1 He' wrbte several . letters, one to
Patterson, telling him to secure from the
railr.oad paymaster the money he had ad
vanced, and another to Occidental Lodge
No. 6, Ancient Order of United Workmen,
giving instructions about his burial, for
Devine says he intended, to commit sui
cide-as soon as he had killed O'Connor,
but he was too ouickly arrested. -
The shooter* Â» face was all blackened when
he stepped around the corner and shot O'Connor
at the woodshed. He fired one shot Into the
back of his head, and then another as O'Con
nor was falling. I saw the mah Walk away
with his gun in his hand. He. started down
the track toward Shell Mound, and saw ine
behind the fence at the works. He said :
"I've killed the â . I've been
looking for him for twenty years."
Officer Welch, of the racetrack, came up
then and took charge of the man, who handed
over his pistol to the officer. Others came
along and took the man away.
Strange is the narrative of this aveng
ing husband. But it is met with the fiat
tent kind of denials by his daughter, Miss
Mary Devine, a student at the Univer
sity of California, and residing at 2217
Fulton street, Berkeley, who says her
father has for years suffered from at
tacks of- insanity, and that his tales of
infidelity are the vagaries of an unbal
anced mind. Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦ ' .,
From the O Connor family comes the
similar firm and positive expression of
their unbelief In the utterances of the
imprisoned slayer of his 'old-time friend.
George Walsh, an employe of the West
ern Carbonic Acid Gas Works, a witness
to thÂ« shooting, said:
Devine submitted to arrest without re
sistance and was taken to the County
Jail.. : Coolly and quietly lie declared his
satisfaction at the death of his enemy. .'
"I killed him and 1 am glad he is dead,"
declared the murderer. "He has ruined
my happiness, and for thirty years has
been my mortal enemy. He Came be

planning his death for years.''

the recommendation of the Public Utill-
I ties Committee that the Lincoln-school
site be selected whereon to erect the
library building donated by Andrew Car
negie. . *'Â£>Â£v/ â¢ . -â¢
Brandenstein held that the Lincoln
school site was inappropriate for a public
library both from an architectural and
economic point of view. He argued that
the library should be in a more remote
locality. Comte's motion that the City
Attorney render his opinion as to the
right of the board to transfer school
properties for other purposes was adopted.
Braunhart objected to turtner delay, say
ing that the pebple were dissatisfied with
the dilatory action of the board regarding
bonded improvements. Brandenstem held
that the people should be permitted to
vote >on the proposition, as they were the
supreme judges as to whether it was ad
visable to acquire a site for the purpose.
Should the Fifth-street site be selected,
Brandenstein said, the people would be
prevented from expressing their will at
.the polls. . ' Â¦
Action was then postponed on the ordi
nances, transferring from the school de
partment to the Public Library trustees
the Lincoln-school lot on Fifth street, 100
by 275 feet in area, as a site for the library
donated by Andrew Carnegie, and also
the lot on Sixteenth street* between Noe

have unlawfully diverted into those pock
ets..". '.;.Â¦. -, 1 - Â¦
Mr. Dalton will have to do this becausa
Judge Ogden handed down a decision to
day in which he finds that the law does
not authorize him to retain fees for col
lections or charge more than actual cost
for assessment rolls.
Judge Ogden's decision is in line with
the one recently rendered by the Supreme
Court in the case of San Francisco
against Assessor Dodge. There it was
held that the retention of fees was. un
lawful.
Prior to 1897, Judge Ogden finds, when
the county government act was passed,
the Assessor was paid a gross salary for
his work as Assessor and 15 per cent for
the collection of poll taxes, besides fees
for any assessment books that might be
furnished cities.
Section 4334 of the Political Code de
clares that all fees must be turned over
to the county treasury. Section 148 of tho
county government act, that was enacted
in 1SD8, permits the Assessor to charge for
the actual cost of making the assessment
rolls, and he must file a sworn statement
as to the exact cost. Section 160 of the
same act fixes the salary of the Assessor
at $4000, and declares that "no compensa
tion shall be received for the collection of
poll taxes." Section 21S of that act says
salaried officers shall turn into the county
treasury "fees now or hereafter allowed
by law in all cases, except where specific
ally allowed."
"There is no doubt that it was the in
tent of the Legislature to flx the salary
of the Assessor as a full requltement for
his services," - Judge Ogden says. "The
defendant claims that there Is a conflict
between sections 215 and 160, but If thai
is so the later one controls, and so thero
is nothing in that. It simply means tnat
the salaries provided in the act shall be
full compensation for the services of the
Assessor." â¢ T Â¦ --: â¢ .
In conclusion Jufge Ogden finda that tha
county is entitled to a judgment for tha
commissions and fees retained by Dalton,
less the cost of making the rolls â at $2100. .
The fees collected by Dalton were 15 per
cent of $25,136. worth of poll taxes that
were collected In 1900, amounting to
$3769 95; the sums of $1333. $1064 and $912
that were collected from the city of Oak
land for furnishing the assessment rolls
for 1899 and 1900.
As the Supreme Court has held that tho
Assessor connot collect commissions Dal
ton is likely not to attempt a reversal of
Judge Ogden's decision on appeal. Hl3
salary, by stipulation, has been tn abey
ance for several months, as the county
government act prohibits the payment to
an official of his salary until he has
turned over all fees on the 1st of each
month. This Dalton has not done for
several years. ~> .--.-

Two footpads armed with revolvers held
up.' Herbert Cramer, -an insurance clerk,
at, the corner ; ot Pine arrt Battery
streets at 8:45 o'clock last night' and
robbed him of $40. Cramer had just. left
the', office of George -H. Tyson, on San
some street, near California, where he is
employed, and was hurrying to catch the
Oakland boat. As he reached the corner
of Pine and Battery streets two men
suddenly jumped out in front of him, and
shoving a pistol under his nose ordered
him to throw up his hands. The com
mand was Instantly obeyed. One of the
robbers then threw one arm around Cra
mer's neck and pressed the muzzle of a
pistol against his temple while the other
robber rifled the victim's pockets. They,
took Cramer's money but overlooked his
gold watch and chain.
After relieving the young man of his
coin the highwaymen ordered him to
move i on. When Cramer arrived at his
home,, 590 Sycamore street. Oakland, he
telephoned to police headquarters in this
city and reported the robbery, but was
unable to give a good description of the
footpads. Â¦

TROUBLE MAY ATTEND -
THE BUSH FOB HOMES
LOS ANGELES. March 31.â Although
there will be no excitement at the. local
Land Office regarding the San Jacinto Re
serve opening to-morrow at 9 p. m., there
may be trouble at the scene of the rush.
For two weeks seven substitutes have oc
cupied chairs in the Potomac Block, where
the . Land Office is located, under salary,
it is said, from an organization of River
side men. These will early to-morrow
morning give way, when the applicants
will take their places in .the line.
It was supposed that the Riverside men
were safely in .first place for the selec
tion of land, but a general alarm, was
sounded last evening when it was dis
covered that a number of men had gath
ered at Cochella, near Waters, Riverside
County. These propose to "rush" at mid
night to-night and squat upon the choicest
6f the reserve. The Riverside men, who
already have expended - several hundred
dollars to hold the first seven places, have
dispatched men to the San Jacinto Re
serve and will "rush" as well as regis
ter. ' : â¢.

The Right Food Will Drive It Away
FOOD AND NEURALGIA.
Good food cures neuralgia and many
other ciseases If it is the right kind of
food and taken regularly, for the' proper
food will surely rebuild the cellular tis-
eues and build the right kind of cells In-
etcad of " diseased dells. When the re-
building is under way the disease leaves.
That is the fact and the base of the
food cure. There are hundreds of thou-
eands of cases to prove the truth of thla
assertion. . Â¦
A man in Delaware. la.. Mr. Thomas
Craven, says: "My wife has been greatly
effiicted with neuralgia and has never
found any medicine that would cure her.
"I was told that If she could be fed on
Grape Nuts Breakfast Food for a , time
che would probably get well, so we
etarted on Grape-Nuts. Within a very
ehort time Wife became entirely free
from pain and Is now. to all appearances,
entirely cured of her trouble.

' AV ' When Rheumatism settles in the bones and muscles of the legs, ..
. lf\ it is safe to predict that the victim will eventually become helpless

and ankles swell, and when the natural oils and fluids that lubricate
these -parts are completely destroyed the joints become locked and
. the muscles drawn and stiff.and crutches a' necessity.
The acid poisons that produce rheumatic pains form in the blood, and are
distributed through the system, and lodged in the arms, shoulders, hands,
back and feet, or other parts of the body â resulting often in total disability.
A permanent cure of Rheumatism can be effected only by a complete cleans-
ing of the blood; and no other remedy so surely accomplishes this as S. S. S.

I ""SrNESS CHANCES-^ontlpned. ___ J
WE have for sale rights for the States of Cal-
ifornia. Oregon and Washington for the best
locked- wire fence device ever patented. r The
owner of the patent is a practical ranch man
who has 200 miles of barbwlre fence In the
Panhandle, ' and who is now going over the
entire fence system of his ranch, putting In
the stays with this locked-fence device. The
device has taken like wildfire in the Eastern
States. The State of Iowa alone sold fcr
$10,000. We have families of the device at
our office, where it can be seen. The prin-
cipal advantage of this fence device is that
It makes a fence that is almost Indestruct-
ible; no power can move the stays when put
on with our patent fastener and patent
wrench. If this device were adopted In Cali-
fornia it certainly would revolutionize fenc-
ing. The fence is cattle-proof, and by put.
ting in enough stays you can . fence against
the smallest animals. The device can be used
i on ornamental fences or lor office wire work.
The wrench and clips and possibly some
models of the fence can be seen at the City
Wire Work*, on Main st.. between Seventh
and Eighth. Mr. Biescar. the proprietor,
will be glad to explain its use. MINING IN-

The President and Mrs. Roosevelt and
their children, together with a number of
friends, appeared on the portico of the
White House while the crowda were on
the grounds and the - former was kept
busy in acknowledging the many saluta
tions he received from the little ones. The
party remained on the portico until the
gusts of wind and a threatened shower
drove the multitude to shelter.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â The green
sward back of the White House was alive
to-day with crowds of children, who, with
baskets. filled with brightly colored eggs,
entered with zest into the annual Easter
Monday egg-rolling carnival. The sky
was alternately bright and overcast, but
neither contingency seemed to affect the
spirits of the young revelers. â¢ .
The attendance was not confined to
children, for a great many older persona
were present, some to keep a watchful
eye on the young ones and others to see
a pretty sight. The throng was thor
oughly cosmopolitan, all sorts and condi
tions of children mingling freely in the
fun. The grounds were open from 9
o'clock in the morning until sunset. The
Marine Band gave a concert at 4 o'clock
and brought to a close a thoroughly en
joyable day for the younger generation.

The House to-day began consideration
of the sundry civil service appropriation
bill, completing the general debate before
the close of the session. Little of the
speech-making to-day was pertinent to
the bill. Williams of llississippi, Pou of
North Carolina and Spight of Mississippi
spoke on the proposed investigation of
the Southern franchise question.
Bell of Colorado discussed the financial
bills before the House. Payne, chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee, re
ported the Cuban reciprocity bill â¢ and
gave notice that he* would call it up a
week from to-morrcw.
| Simons of North Carolina made an
extended argument in opposition to the
bill, reinforcing points ' heretofore made
against the proposed legislation and add
ing some new arguments. Dillinghara of
Vermont presented a legal â¢ argument In
support the measure and vigorously
arraigned the manufacturers of oleomar
garine for imposing, he said, a fraud upon
the people.
In supporting the pending bill McCum
ber of Worth Dakota expressed. the belief
that the farmers -of the country wero, en
titled to the protection afforded by the
bill.
"WASHINGTON, March 3Lâ During the

"Myname is Kate Mclntyre. a daughter

Joseph Milian left the Brunswick House, .;
at Sixth and Howard streets. -telling, me j
that he was going to meet- Charles .Bu
channan. with whom he had arranged* the
night previous to rob James Mclntyre,
my father, at $61 Bryant street. I was
acquainted with the plan and consented to
it. I believed that Milian intended . to
marry me. ' and all that prevented him j
from doing it was the lack of money. â¢ I
had discussed the proposed j qobbery with
Milian. and told him that my father kept
money in an iron box and that there was:
over $400 there. . , .. . â¢ !
"About an hour and. a half after Millian
left Buchannan came to my room at the
Brunswick House, and shortly afterward
was Joined by Milian. Milian told me'
that they had been to my father's house
and succeeded, in getting. in, but 'did not
get any money. He said' they hadibeen
obliged to strike the old man. several
times, but he was not hurt much. As

channan secured from her the Information
that the old man kept a large sum of
money In his house.and they concluded to
rob him. When the detectives were first
put on the case they learned that a -waiter
named Joseph Milian had been living with
the Mclntyre girl at the Brunswick House
at Sixth and - Howard streets for, some
months past, and they took him into cus
tody on suspicion: Later- they ascertained
that he had a partner named. Buchannan,
who answered â¢ the description Â¦ of ! the
larger of the two assailants, and-.bdth of
these.were in custody when the old man's
daughter broke down and ' told of = their
connection with the crime. Her account
of the facts as she stated it last night is
as follows* ""
The girl readily identified - both men.
AVhen Milian was asked if he knew the
girl. he answered, airily: "Well! I ought to.
I- have been engaged : .to her twice."
Buchanan -said he knew, the girl: by sight
only. Later he admitted knowing her
personally, but denied any knowledge -of
the crime attributed tohim. - : Â¦ -'
woman pleaded first with her con
sort and then 'with both men to tell the
truth, assuring them that U would- be. bet

over again to Milian that -she loved' him
better than life, and that if he- was pun

iner of Jackson and Dupont . streets, Ia3t
evening. The bullet that struck the un
fortunate 'Japanese and sent | him to the
hospital was intended to end the earthly
career of some highbinder, on. whose head
a price had been set. Who did the shoot-
Ing 1 is yet a matter of conjecture, but
Detectives^ McMahon and Gibson, who
were detailed on the case, expect. to land
the Mongolian . gunman . behind the bars
before very long. Two shots were fired,
one o'f the bullets striking Murui In the
right hip. ~ , , '
At the Central Emergency Hospital, to
which the injured Japanese was taken,
he made a statement to the effect that
he was walking down Jackson street when
the -shooting occurred. . He said he heard
one shot, and turning, saw a Chinese
with a gun leveled at another ' Chinaman,
who was standing near him. " A second
shot followed and Murul felt a sharp pain
and fell to the sidewalk. The shooter was
attired | in " American clothes and wore a
sweater. He made his escape through a
building on Dupont street, . between Jack

Another' story is. that the shots were
fired by. another Japanese. Some Chinese
spectators say .that a Japanese dropped a

away and the owner of the property fired
the shots at him. This story is discredited

' Â¦â¢' When . the Archbishops - of America se

will- be; chosen -to assist his Grace Arch
bishop Riordan. '
Will Work in Harmony.
It Is rumored, however, that the ap
pointee must be a comparatively young
man.- Bishop Montgomery is already well
on In years and is in fact almost as old as
his Grace Archbishop .Riordan. It is con
ceded, however," that should Bishop Mont
gomery be appointed from the Holy See
of â¢ Rome there would < be no more pop
ular movement In the Catholic church on
the Pacific Coast. v
The most prominent prelate for the of
fice locally is the Right Rev. Montgom
ery, Bishop of 'the Diocese , of Monterey.
Should the selection have been left to the
local council of iremovable rectors, Bishop
Montgomery surely would have secured
the office. He has made a splendid record
in Southern California during' his many
years of service as a Bishop and he is
certainly'the popular choice. *>.
The coadjutor, who will be Archbishop
Riordan's successor, will be a Bishop and
he will upon the retirement of Archbishop
Riordan succeed him as Archbishop of
San. Francisco. When â¢ <he coadjutor is
appointed he will be selected by the Arch
bishops of this country and his name will
be sent to Rome, for indorsement. Who
this Bishop will be is a subject that is
causing muoh discussion in ecclesiastical
circles. The nominee, in any event; will
be a Bishop of the Catholic church and
not . a cleric who holds no higher rank"
than that of assistant pastor.
Will Send Name to Rome.
That the Archbishop, intends (applying
for a coadjutor to 'assist him Is- a 'fact.
The Call many months ago made the an
nouncement that his Grace was seriouslv
contemplating the. step. Since that time,
however, Archbishop Riordan's health
has steadily improved and he temporarily
let the subject pass from his mind. In the
last month or so the noted prelate has
been unusually " hard worked and at a
meeting of the local pastors of San Fran
cisco he casually brought the matter up.
He stated that he was growing older and
that as Catholicism spread in his diocese
he felt the need of a coadjutor.', - l "
While his Grace is in Washington he will
meet a number of the Archbishops, but it
Is most improbable that the prelates will
at this time make nominations 'for a
coadjutor. "\.-.;'.V~r ' â¢ "

is made, many will conclude that his mis
sion East is for the purpose of consulting
with J the other American Archbishops in
reference to the selection of a.' coadjutor
to assist him in his labors. Such is not
the case, however. He goes to Washing

Is only one of many distressing symp-
toms which point to the presence oÂ£
womanly diseases: If women thoroughly
understood the relation of the local wom-
anly health to the general health; they
would understand that
backache, headache,
nervousness, sideache,
dizziness, faintness and
similar feminine ail-
ments, cannot be cured
until the womanly
health is established!
Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription cures dis-
eases peculiar to wom-
en. It establishes reg-
ularity, dries the drains
which .weaken women,
heals inflammation and
nlceration, and cures
female weakness. In
curing these local dis-
eases, it cures the ail-
ments which they
cause; backache, head-
ache, sideache, dizzi-
ness, faintness, nerv-
ousness, and other ills
peculiarly feminine. .
Â« X wrote you for advice
February <th, 1806," writes
Mrs. Loma Haistead. of
Claremore, Cherokee Nat.,
Ind. Ter. "I was rackinjj with pain from the
back of my head down to my heels. Had hemor-
rhage for weeks at a time, and was unable to sit
tip lor ten minutes at a time. You answered my
letter, advised me to use vour valuable medicines,
viz., I>r. Tierce's FavoriCe Prescription. J Golden
Medical Discovery,' and â¢ Pleasant Pellets.' also
gxve advice about injections, baths and diet. To
my surprise, in four mouths from the time I be-
gan yoar treatment I was a well woman and
have not had the backache since, and npyr I put
ia sixteen hours a day at hard work."
A Great Strain.
_ ICo one disputes the fact that we are
living in a "rapid" age; it Is rush, rush,
rush, from morning until night, and com-
petition is sojfierce that the struggle does
not cease until the machine Is worn out.
.Women, too, even when surrounded by
every comfort, 'become infected by the
common spirit, and what with their- clubs
and many social duties, have no time to
â¢give thought, to their physical well-being,
until they are suddenly brought to a
sharp realization of the j fact . that noth-
ing m their lives-is so Important as at-
tention to^ correct,, or rational living. It
may surprise the readers to learn that
women are more prone to piles than men.
and in most cases, because it is difficult
to impress upon them the- importance of
regular movements of the bowels; Irreguyr"*
larity .means straining at^ stool, ari-y.;
straining means piles, with the^ certainty %;
(under the usual methods of treatment)
that the sufferer will "have them alway3
with her;", by "usual methods" Is meant
the application, of salves and: lotions, or
(as a last resort) a surgical operation. If
there Is a complaint which entails more
distress and suffering upon those afflicted
than plies or hemorrhoids, it Is not
known to the writer; fortunately, how-
ever, these are learning that there is a
remedy that effectually cures all . forms
of piles; It is known as the Pyramid Pile-
Cure, is In suppository form, fs applied
directly to the parts, and does its work
quickly and painlessly; it is. sold by drug-
gists for. fifty cents a package, or will be-
mailed by the makers to any address,
upon receipt of price. Mrs. John H. Cas-
tona, 2912 Arch street. Chicago, says: *"I*
must -write you that I was cured of a -
very aggravating case of itching and
bleeding , piles by the use - of the great
remedy. Pyramid Pile i Cure, even after
several physicians had claimed there was
no cure except -.by an operation- I am
well now, and owe all to this valuable
remedy. I cannot say enough for it."
"Write the Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall.
Mich., for their little book on the cause
and cure of piles.

DIRT CLEARANCE.
Â¦; |#?*tJT is a gopd plan for every bather to know
r^ii^ something of the soap he uses. There is .a
well-founded objection to using a floor-clean-
1^ ing soap upon the human body. Ivory Soap
: is the , bather's soap/* It costs more than common
soaps, but the difference is in the ingredients and
making. Why not treat yourself with a little respect.
Is not the human skin with its marvellous delicacy
entitled to pure soap? Ivory Soapâ *it floats.
