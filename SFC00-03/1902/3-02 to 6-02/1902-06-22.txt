homage begins.
The Earl of Clarendon, " who has been
Lord Chamberlain since 1900, is to conw
very near to greatness ' in the ceremony.
Before the oath is administered the nobles
gathered around the. King- must retire
all except the Lord Chamberlain!. Save
for this dignitary the King will receive
the oath r.lone.
After the anointing the spurs will be pre
sented- to. the sovereign by the Lord
.Chamberlain. At one point in the cere
mony before the .coronation oath the King
gives his crown to the Lord Chamberlain
to hold, which is a tremendous privilege
to reach and very few titles are big
enough to carry this privilege along with
them. The Earl will hold it while his

physicians and apothecaries. It, is hia
duty to inspect the charges of coronations.
The state palaces -of- Windsor Castle.

under his charge. All functions he over

So it is easy to understand, that he is
a very busy man at present and has been
for many weeks. JL is also easy to un-
Primate, and he set his lips in a way that
only England's Archbishop would dare do. j
"I won't have it done. It'il make me a
fright," said the lady.
The lady and the priest continued to
argue. The matter was submitted to ar
bitration. King Edward did. not want to
emer into the affair at all, for he had al
ready had ull kinds of a time with 'hor
en the subject of her wearing a purple
re be.' He had attempted to square that
matter by telling her that she had a com
plexion which would stand for anything,
but she had been married, so many years
that this was a waste- of words.
So he decided to wash his hands of the
oil.- He refused to have anything what
ever to say about it. And it was left to
the tact and ingenuity of that wonderful
Sl-year-old man, Temple, himself, to get
around the difficult, matter.
"We will have the oils prepared in a
celiii form of wax," said he.
Which (shows that he has a-plenty of
wisdom in affairs temporal, for he baa
succee.ded In managing a woman.
. As the ceremony progresses the Arch
bishop's duties grow manifold. He hands
the sword to the sovereign. He delivers
.the scepter with the cross into his right
hand and the rod with the dove into his
left. Then comes the actual Â¦ crowning. .
The Archbishop, standing before, the
altar, takes the crown in his hands, and,
laying it. again on the altar, says a col
lect for a blessing on the sovereign about
to be crowned. The Dean cf Westmin
ster brings the crown from the altar and
the Archbishop takes it from him and
reverently places it upon the King's head.

After the sovereign enters the abbey by
the west door the Archbishop will per

the King remains standi7ig by his seat,
which is known us the chair of recogni

points of the compass as the little pro
cession attending him makes its way tirst
to one side, then to another of the thea
ter. The Archbishop's big English voice
wiil then -be heard addressing the as
sembled congregation:
"Sirs, I here present unto you King Ed
ward, the undoubted King of this realm:
wherefore all you who' are come this day
to do your homage, are you willing to do
the same?" t
After this the people shall cry with one
voice and that a lusty one:
"God save Kinjj Edward!"
After the Litany, ante-communion serv
ice and sermon have taken place the
Archbishop will perform the ceremony of
sr.ointing the King.
Ihe King will by this time have taken
his seat in St. Edward's chair. The-
Archbishop will anoint him with conse
crated oil, making the sign of- the cross
or his head and hands. 'The Queen, by
the way, has been causing a great dis
turbance of late by refusing to have her
face anointed with the consecrated oils.
"I won't," was what she said.
For a Queen to say "1 won't"! And the
dignified Queen ot Great Britain at that!
It might have been expected a couple of
years ago from whimsical little Wilhelm
ina when' she was in her moods of whim
sicality; but it surprised the subjects of

said "won't" and there was nothing to do
except dodge an issue. It was a case of
a woman's "won't," which is all the

The Duke of Newcastle, who is Her/ry

squabbles and v.onder what difference the

it. becomes an affair of state on t/ie other
Â¦ side of the water. j
Of all the overworked people. /the Duke
of Norfolk is the most so. To him, the
coronation means some glory, but far
more wcrk. He is literally manager of all
details and every question, except thosa
ecclesiastical, is referred to him. He is
hereditary Earl Marsha) of .England,
which means that he is by right of hered
ity the .stage manager of the whole show.
He is to act as chief butler of England.
- It is his noble duty to perfect every ar
rangement from that of the line of marcli
â¢ to the coronet of each peeress.
For "JCO years the Dukes of Norfolk
have been the premier peers of England.
For that distinction the present Duke i.-Â»
paying by doing the work of at least
twenty ordinary men. He has been In
structed by Kins Edward to make tho
pageant as splendid as It can be made,
and he is therefore managing the labors
of the entire heralds' college. The col
lege is working to the end of making this
ore of the greatest displays ever seen.
Twenty secretaries are being employed
by the Duke in attending to his corre
spondence on the subject of the corona
tion. He has for weska past been receiv
ing letters by the thousands. They come
from lords and ladies, who ask all sorts
of questions concerning their duties and
v their robes, the two points at present con

â¢Â£ iif' tht? ' ceremony.
'And this for the - aake of a procession, a

Hut for all it's so simple. It's the male

Archbishop Temple, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, is the most important per-
Koijage in the religious part of the cere
mony. He Is very much absorbed in the
flll-imiortant preparations and has been
fr>r a long time. What the Archbishop
frays means a great deal to England, not
only to the people as a whole but to those
in power.
Tht Archbishop is an old man now, ai
riest El years old. He has reached his
h:gh position after long years of service,
and this great ceremony Is something of
a coronation to him as well as to the
King whom he is to crown. He is a pow
erlui. keen Englishman still in spite of
his years. He saw . Victoria's reign
ttiicugh from beginning to end. He is
*.aid to be no hale and hearty yet that he
may live through even the long reign
â¢which all true subjects wish for their
j:ord and beloved King Edward.
He ts having a gTeat deal of trouble
with his King. Edward VII has ideas of
hit own. and they are a good many years
yourger than those of the Archbishop.
For one thins, the King thinks that
Right Rev. Randall Thomas Davidson
Is the dignitary who holds this title. He
hes been clerk of the Closet in Ordinary
to the King since 190L He is a man in his
fit ticsâ a man in the prime of life as his
work reckons it.
The Bishop of Winchester is another
important peison in the ecclesiastical
functions of the ceremony. After the Bi
ble has been presented to the King by the
Archbishop of Canterbury it Is returned
to the altar. After the ceremony i* passes
into the hands of the Bishop of Winches
ter as Prelate of the Order of the Garter
at? his perquisite.
On the twenty-sixth of this month, the
day to which ail England and some of
the fortunate of America ate looking for
ward with short breath, the King and
Queen will proceed in the coach from
Buckingham Pa'.ace to the west door of
Y'cstmiriFttr Abbe;'.
There the ceremonial will commence
and -will be according to ancient prece
dent. The processions will be under the
chaige of the Duke of Norfolk, who is
hereditary Larl Marshal. On the theater
will be two thronesâ the King's being
two steps higher than the Queen's.
The first ceremony is that of Recog
nition. Then the oath, the anointing,
the crowning, and then the sovereign
vili be lifted to his throne by the arch
bishops and bishops. Then follows the
homage.
The Queen s coronation is similar, ex
cept that she will not be crowned In
St. Edward's chair as the King is to
be.
After these things are over the proces
sion will go to St. Edward's chapel, lay
aside lobes ard regalia and return in
the coach to Buckingham Palace.
Ever since the time of William the
Conqueror it has been customary for
the Archbishop of Canterbury to be
chfef ecclesiastic at the coronation*.
This c-p.se will be r.o exception to Ina
old rule. The famous Archbishop Tem
ple will have charge of affairs religious.
It is another time-honored custom for
the Bishop of London to preach the ser
mon at the great ceremony. Ingram is
the new Bishop of London." Another an
cient rule is that the Archbishop of
York shall assist him.
There are some of Great Britain's most
famous men who ure to be conspicuous in
both the .temporal and spiritual part of
liÂ« brief the progress of the ceremony
-will be this:
3Â»^ HE King and Queen are not by any
. means the only Its at the corona-
Ktion.
Perhaps they do not realize this
"fs.cL They are very much ab
sorbed with affairs of their own. ThÂ«
King has been having- all kinds of dis
putes with the Archbishop as to . th
form of the ceremony. The Queen has
b<en at the point of tears a dozen times
because she is being forced to wear pui
rle while- it is a color she abhors, and sh\
has threatened to do as she pleased, and
begged in turn for either red or white.
These two hardly know that there is to
be anybody else at the coronation. But
there are those to ass-st at the ceremony
who are ' quite worth the p^ice of admis
sion a!! by themselves.

DIGNITARIES OF THE CHURCH
AND STATE WISO OFFICIATE
AT THE CROWNINGIn conclusion he adds the "sub-echo" as
now used brings the following curious
facts to our notice:
"If I do not play an unnecessarily high
card it Indicates that I do not want my
partner to lead another trump, and there
fore do not signal him to do so. I as
plainly tell him this fact as I could by
'calling for trumps' when I do not want
him to lead one. Yet this 'calling' when
I don't want a trump led Is termed tho
'sub-echo.' The very reverse system
conveys the same information and Is in
accord with uniformity." .
"The principal object of this .so-termed
'sub-echo' is, however, to inform your
partner that you hold three trumps when
you have shown that you do not hold four
or more, and the method which has been
adopted to indicate this fact is to call
later in hand in order to intimate to your
partner that you do not wish him to lead
trumps. It seems to me that the very
opposite system is more in conformity
with what Is conventional.
"When, then, you hold the only trump
not In your partner's hand, to his lead of
the plain suit you play your lowest card.
If, however, you do not hold the remain
ing trump you give the signal 'change
your suit to trumps,' which would be in
terpreted, Lead your king, as one of the
adversaries holds the other trump.
The average intellect, when too much
harassed with minor details, cannot
grasp and understand the main points of
the game. Of course there are many in
stances where the "sub-echo" is of very
great value, and advanced players find it
to their advantage. Let them practice it
by all means, as every one is entitled to
the benefit of their own superior skill.
My advice to beginners is not to burden
themselves with too many signals, but
leave the "sub-echo" to the more ad
vanced players. In the Whist for June,
1898, General Drayson points out that this
method of the "sub-echo" should be re
versed. Let me quote his own words:
"If partner has taken out two rounds of
trumps, and cannot place the remaining
trump, he will therefore open his strong
plain suit. For example, he leads queen,
and then ace, of his suit. The opportun
ity for the 'sub-echo' now comes in It
has been recommended that in order to
let your partner know that you hold the
last trump, you should play an unnec
essarily high card to your partner's
queen, and a lower card to his ace, and
this is the 'sub-echo.' -Thus in order to
inform your partner that you hold the
remaining trump, and do not want an
other trump led, adopt the conventional
signal of 'calling for trumps' when you
do not want your partner to lead trumps.
Surely this is somewhat complicated and
inconsistent, especially as the same in
formation can be given by the 'change
your suit to trumps' signal.
"Let us take the same case as above;
your partner is in doubt after leading two
round of trumps, from an original lead
of six trumps, whether you hold the
other trump: he therefore opens his
plain suit. If you are a whist player you
know perfectly well why your partner
did not take out the third round of
trumps.
use. Again, too many signals are apt to
distract the mind of the player from more
important matters.

VERY excellent out-of-door portraits
may be made even by the novice
and with the inexpensive apparatus
in use by many, beginners. . Atten
tion should be paid to the following
suggestions, however, which will materi
ally aid in the work. Choose a time when
the sun is obscured by light clouds and its
rays not too intense. A "gray day" is
good, or if the sitting is desired on a
bright, sunny day place the sitter in the
shadow of a tree or building, where the
direct rays will be avoided.' Provide a tri
pod or some solid support for the camera,
never attempting quick exposures for a
subject of this nature. If the sitter is
posed beneath a tree see to it that no
bright spots of sunshine fall upon the face
or clothing,, and carefully avoid light col
ored or brilliantly illuminated objects in
the immediate background. Let the sit
ter's eyes be directed toward some dark
or shadowed object rather, than into
bright sunshine, as the expression of the
eye will then be much more I natural.
Place the camera at, or about, a level
with the sitter's chin, and near enough so
that the sitter is the most prominent ob
ject, of the picture. Remember that this
is, a portrait and not a view for which
you are aiming, and take care that the
background and foliage is far enough
away from the sitter to be partly out of
focus or slightly , blurred when viewed
upon the ground glass or finder. Give full
exposure, and in development pay no at
tention to the background or accessories,
developing only for the face and flguro
and letting the rest take care of itself.
Avoid an overdense negative. i . The figure
may be either sitting or standing, care be
ing taken that. the pose is wholly natural .
and devoid of all artificiality or apparent
posing.

PHOTOGRAPHIC POINTERS FOR AMATEURS
A pious lady of Portsmouth had a hus
band who was a seaman.
He was about to start on a protracted
voyage, and, as his wife was anxious as
to her husband's welfare, she sent the
following notice to the village preacher:
"Mr. Blank, who is going to sea, his
wife desires the prayers of the congrega
tion."
As the old lady was quite illiterate tha
minister read the following to the congre
gation from the slip handed to him:

wife, desires the prayers of the congrega

Bob-cat stands on the edge, that a-way,
as he saveys when, he's plugged he'll fall
for'ard on his face. When a gent gets
the gaff for shore, he falls for'ard. If a

Black Cloud, turnin' a heap sarcastic,
'that she comes.to meet me? Is it for me

next day a Creek boy finds the body of
Sunbright where she rolls herse'f Into the

sees the knife slash on Sunbright' s heel,
he reads the trooth. It gives him a bad
heart; he paints his face red an' black an'
thinks how he'll be revenged. Next day
he sends a runner to Black Cloud with
word that Black Cloud has done stole his

The green parrot stuffed, but with Its
feet missing, is to be found in natural
history museums all over the world. But
no one has ever succeeded in keeping a
specimen alive in captivity.â New York
Sun. ; ;--/-'
The natives say that the birds always
commit suicide in the same way, by peck
ing at their breasts until the jugular vein
is exposed. A final peck severs the artery
8nd the bird quickly bleeds to death. The
quetzal dies, but never surrenders.
No parrot has ever been brought from
its forest home alive. They struggle des
perately when caught, and when they
find they cannot escape they kill them
selves, so it is declared.
The parrot perches on the sticky limb
and is held fast. The natives remove the
bird from the limbs by the .simple ex
pedient of cutting off their feet.
The parrots are too wary to be caught
in a trap. The Indians first watch the
parrot, sometimes, for days at a time,
until they discover their haunt3. Then
they smear the limbs of surrounding trees
with thick glue.
The quetzal lives In the wildest parts
of the mountains and never visits the
neighborhood of the town3 or cities. The
only parrots ever brought out of the for
ests are caught by the native Indians.
The Guatemalans say that this bird,
which so skillfully eludes capture and dies
rather than surrender, is typical of their
own country and its people.
The Guatemalans are very proud of
\heir national bird and have written many
songs and poems about it. The parrot
was selected for the national emblem r>e
cause it was found very hard to catch
and because tradition says that when once
imprisoned it always kills Itself rather
than remain in captivity.
It is found only in the forests of Guate
mala. The green parrot or quetzal, as it
is called, has been made the national em
blem of Guatemala, just as the American
eagle has become the national emblem of
the United States.

The "sub-echo" is the name bestowed
upon the play which indicates the holding
criginally of exactly three trumps after
there has been a refusal to echo posses
eicn of four trumps.
The "sub-echo," therefore, can only be
given in plain suit and when two rounds
of trumps have already been played and
you have not echoed, four trumps.
For example, partner leading trumps,
the first round falling to opponents and
you net holding four trumps, play your
lowest trump; the two, for instance,
would show you were not echoing.
The opponent then opens ace and king
cf his suit. You should play a high card
and then a lower, for instance the three
and then the two, which proclaims the
original possession of three trumps and
the "sub-echo."
It often happens that partner has called
for trumps. You can show three trumps
ljy "sub-echoing" In plain suit. For ex
ample, the opponent leads the queen of
his suit. You holding just three trumps,
say the eight, four and two, on the queen
you play the four, on the ace you play
tae eight and on the king you play the
two. You have now completed the "sub
echo." There has been much discussion
among whist experts on the advisability
cf using the "sub-echo," as it Is apt to
complicate the play and to be a source of
n-Isunderstandins between partners. One
cf the principal objections is that it takes
too Ions to develop, as two suits must be
led and one continued until the third
round before any definite knowledge can
t>3 conveyed, and in most cases the in
formation comes too late to be of any
BY MRS. E. P. SCHELL.
THE student will understand that
when his partner calls for or lead*
trumps he is supposed to echo, if lie

"When I'm pesteiin' about the Osages
on that one o'casion when I'm tryin' to
make a round-up of my health, the old
buck Strike Axe relates to me a tale which
I allers looks on as possessin' elements.
Will 1 tell it to you-all? Shore; an' it's as
simple an' straight as the eights of a
Winchester. It's about a squaw an' three
bucks, an' thar's enough blood in it to

frills Â¦wherewith a professional racontoor
ib so prone to overload his narratives.
"The Black Cloud is a Osage medicine
man an' has repoote about Greyhoss,

He's got a squaw, Sunbright, an' he's
plenty jealous of this yere "little Sun

weds all the sisters of a fam'ly at once
that a-way, the oldest sister goin' to the
front at the nuptials to deal the weddin'
game for the .entire outfit.
"Now this Sunbright ain't over-enam
oured of Black Cloud; he's only a half
blood. Injun for one thing, his father bein'
a buffalo-man (negro) who's j'ined the
Osages, an' Sunbright don't take kindly
to his nose, â¢which is some flatter than the
best rools of Osage beauty demands; an'
likewise thar's kinks in his ha'r. Stiil,
Sunbright sort o' keeps her aversions tj
herse'f, an' if it ain't for what follows,
she most likely would have traveled to
her death-blankets an' been given a seat
on a hill with a house of rocks built
'round her â the same bein' the usual bur
ial play of a Osageâ without Black Cloud
ever saveyin' that so far from interestin' :
Sunbright, he only makes her tired.
"Black Cloud's camp is at Greyhoss, the
eame bein* a Osage village. Over south,
across the Arkansas an' some'ers between
the Pole Cat an' the Cimmaron, thar's a
voung Creek buck called the Lance. He's
straight an' slim an* strong as the weepon
he's named for; an' he like Black Cloud
is a medicine sharp of cel'bratlon an' 'way
up in the papers. The Creeks is never
weary talkin' about the Lance, an' whac
a marvel as a medicine man he is; also,
by way of insaltin' the Osages, they de

over Black Cloud like four tens over ace

"By what Strike Axe Informs meâ an*
he ain't none likely to overplay in his
statementsâ by what Strike Axe tells me,
I says, the Lance must shore have been

into his medicine lodge, an' the next news
you'd get you'd hear the eperits flappin'

"Nacherally, the Black Cloud is some
, heated ag'in the Lance, an' looks on him
with a baleful eye as a rival. Stfll, Black
Cloud has his nerve with him constant,
. an' tharfore one day when the Osages an'
Creeks has been dlspootin' touchln' the
respective powers of him an' the Lance,
an' this yere latter Injun offers to come
over to Greyhoss an' make medicine ag'in
him. Black Cloud never hesitates or hangs
buck like a dog onder a wagon, but calls
the bluft a heap prompt an" tells the
Lance to come a-runnin'.
'Which the day is set 3n' the Lance
shows in the door, as monte sharps would
sov. Black Cloud an' the Lance tharupon
indulges themse'fa an' delights the as
sembled Creeks an' Osages with their
whole box of tricks, an' each side is brag
gin' an' boastin' an" puttin' it up that
their gent is most likely the soonest medi
cine man who ever paints his face black.
U'e about a even break between the two.
"Black Cloud accompanies himse'f to
this contest with a pure white pony which
has eyes as loobiesâ a kind of Albino
ponyâ an' he gives it forth that this
yere milk-colored bronco is his 'big medi
cine 1 or familiar sperit. The Lance ob
serves that this little red-eyed hoss is
mighty impressive to the savages, be they
Creeks or Osages. At last he says to
Blae!Â« Cloud:
" 'To show how my medicine is stronger
than yours, to-morry I'll make your red
eyed big medicine bronco go lame in his
â¢ nigh hind les.'
"Black Cloud grins scornful at this; he
allows that no sport can make his white
pony so lame.
"He's plumb wrong: the next mornin'
the whke pony is limpin 1 an' draggin' his
nigh hind hoof, an" when he's standin'
still he p'ints the toe down like some
thing's fetched loose. Black Cloud is sore,
but he can't find no cactus thorn nor
r.othin' to bring . about the lameness,
an" he don't know what to make of the
racket. Black Cloud's up ag'inst it, an'
the audience begins to flgger that the
Lance's medicine, jest as he claims, is too
strong for Black Cloud.
"What's the trouble with the red-eyed
pony? That's simple enough, son. The
Lance done creeps over in the night an'
ties a hoss ha'r tight about the pony's laig
above the fetlock. Black Cloud ain't up
to no sech move, the sftnie. bcin' a trade
secret of the Lance's} an' bein' the hoss
ha'r is hid In the ha'r on the pony's laig,
no one notes its presence.
"After Black Cloud looks his red-eyed
big medicine pony all over, an' can't
onderstand its lameness, the Lance asks
him will he cure it. Black Cloud, who's
scowlln' like a thunder storm by now, re
torts that he will.. So he gets his pipe an'"
fills it with medicine tobacco an' blows a
mouthful of smoke in the red-eyed pony's
nose. Such remedies don't work: that
pony still limps on three laigs, draggin'
the afflicted member mighty pensive.
"At last the Lance gives Black Cloud a
patronizin' smile an' says that his med
icine'll cure the pony, sound an' well,
while you're crackin' off a gun. He walks
up to the pony an' looks long in its red
eyes; the pony's years an' tail droops, its
h<*ad hangs down, an' it goes mighty neai
to sleep. Then, the Lance rubs his hand
two or three times up an 'down the lame :
laig above the fetlock an' nacherally elim
'nates that hossha'r ligature, an' no one '
the wiser. A moment after, he wakes up 1
the red-eyed pony, an' to the amazement
of the Osages an' the unbounded delight '
of the Creeks, the pony is no longer lame
an' said laig late afflicted is as solid an'
healthy as a sod house. What's bigger :
medicine still, the red-eyed pony begins i
to follow the Lance about like a dog an' !
same as if its enamored of him; an' to
bite an 1 r'ar an' pitch an' jump sideways
if Black Cloud tries to put his paw on
him. Then all the Injuns yells with one
voice :
" 'The Lance has won the Black Cloud's :
big medicine red-eyed pony away from 1
him.'
"The Lance is shore the limit, they says, :
an' Black Cloud discovers that he ain't a i
four-spot by comparison. His rcpoota- 1

If taken directly from the washing-box
or tray and allowed to dry without this
rinsing of the film side there is great
danger of the negative showing small
bubbles and air cells after drying, which
it is then too late to remedy. A tuft of
absorbent cotton will be found a most
convenient adjunct to all washing opera
tions connected with photography
Users of films will find that after devel
opment and fixing they may be washed
with ease and certainty by pinning the
strips to a piece of board and floating the
same/film down. In the bathtub. In this
way they may be left Indefinitely without
attention, and as the chemicals to be
eliminated from the film are heavier than
the water the process is simple and thor

In the washing of negatives after fix

thoroughly rinsed or wiped over under
the tap with a wet and soft wad of ab
sorbent cotton before being put In the
rack to dry-

One of the earmarks by which a suc
cessful amateur Is known is to be found
In the condition of his dark room and the
manner In which his developing and other
solutions are shelved. Nothing is more
important, where chemicals of various
kinds are kept In proximity to one
another, than that each should be prop
erly bottled and labeled in a manner that
Is not only perfectly legible, but also per
manent. One of the best methods for la
beling bottles of this kind is to grind on
the surface of the bottle Itself a patch of
the glass large enough to hold any ordin
ary label that may be required for its
contents. This grinding may be done in a
few moments by rubbing the surface of
the bottle with a piece of emery cloth and
the addition of a little emery powder.
This roughening of the surface gives a
ground glass effect, on which a label may
be written with pencil or Ink, as desired,
after which it may be varnished to pre
vent rubbing off. The careful worker al
ways pours from the bottle on the side
opposite the label, so that the drippings,
which are more or less apt to run down
the side of the bottle, will not obliterate
the label Itself.
The amateur sometimes finds himself
in a position where it is very difficult ta
obtain a sufficient supply of fresh water
to thoroughly carry *out all the washing
necessary for the making of a negative,
and in such cases ho can to . advantage
use sea water for the washing of his
plates after fixing in the hypo, provided
they are again thoroughly rewashed in
fresh water after arriving at a place
where it is obtainable. It will not often
be necessary cr advisable to subject a
large number of plates to this process,
but it may safely be used for such plates*
. as are necessary to test exposures while
traveling, or for other urgent occasions.
Many faulty negatives made during
the summer season are the direct results
of carelessness on the part of the ope
rator in failing to make the dark room
light tight. The desire for ventilation in
the hot, stuffy room leads to all sorts of
experiments for the letting in of air, and
with the air is almost sure to come dan
gerous light, which causes foggy, light
streaked Dlate3 and all sorts of Imper
fections in the negatives, the blame for
which is often Jaid upon the manufac
turer of the plate3. Too much care can
not be taken to keep all light from en
trance and to be sure that the ruby lamp
Is safe in all particulars. An occasional
test should be made of the dark room
conditions by leaving a plate partially
.exposed to the rays of the dark room
lamp for fifteen or twenty minutes and
then developing and fixing in hypo as
usual. If the light is safe the plate will
fix evenly all over, leaving clear glass;
if unsafe, the part that was exposed to
surface of the paper is covered with
minute spots or specks. This is very
often the result of impurities in the
water used in washing, minute particles
of iron being contained in the water of
very many localities. ' Wherever this
trouble is found to exist it may be ob
viated and almost entirely prevented by
filtering the water through a flannel
bag, which may. to advantage, be tied
over the faucet through which the water
Is drawn.

publicity of even the simplest things con
nected with his private life as well 'as
his royal duties he has more than once
by force of circumstances been put to the
severest test to prove his title of "first
gentleman of England," and as many
times he has nobly acquitted himself.
Since his father's death he has been
the acknowledged leader of English so-
cietv. and as patron of the arts he taught
the smart set to support opera until Lon
don has come to be the undisputed center
of musical culture. It is an undoubted
fact, and one by which many Americans
might profit, that King Edward taught
the fashionables by his example to be
in their boxes when the curtain rises,
and that it is bad form to leave before
He once invited to his house a number
of the most distinguished men in a cer
tain profession. They were all, no doubt,
a little nervous at first, but the Prince's
affability soon put each of them at his
ease â so much at his ease,' indeed, that
it is quite possible to understand how
one man among so many misunderstood
his attitude. In the evening the Prince
and his guests adjourned for smoking and
an impromptu entertainment ensued. One
of the nicest and Indeed one of the best
bied of the men took his turn at the piano
and commenced to sing a. song which
was decidedly coarse. .
It is this very dislike of snobbishness
of every sort that has given King Ed
ward his title of "first gentleman of Eng
land." thofigh there were many times,
when, as the Prince of Wales, his position
compelled him to take a course of "action
â¢which has not always been easy ~for
others to appreciate. Here Is "a story
which illustrates why he has always been
known as the "Prince of good fellows."
the performance is over. It was his good
taste and dislike of ostentation that put
an end to the ridiculous old fashioned
custom of the manager receiving royalty
and walking upstairs backward with ;a
pair of lighted candles in his hand. He
also proved his Innate courtesy '^y doing
away with the inconvenience of the cur
tain being kept down until he. arrived,
and he has allowed it to be known that
he strongly objects to the national an
them being played as the signal of his
arrival. Indeed, he gives less trouble
than the majority of his inferiors.
Every eye but that of the singer was
turned on the Prince of Wales. He made
no -effort to disguise his feelings. What
ever he may have thought, he felt that
he was bound to take notice of this In
discretion. He first turned his chair
slightly, but the singer went on singing.
A terrible silence filled the room, but the
singer took it for attention and continued.
The 'Prince coughed and fidgeted a little,
but the singer did not hear or see and
nobody took , the initiative in warning
him. During the next verse the Prince
started talking louder and louder until
the singer's voice was drowned and he
stopped and turned and looked, and when
he realized his position wished the ground
would suddenly open and swallow him.
There was no mistake about it; he had
been snubbed. Cl .
There as far as the Prince -was con
cerned, the matter might have ended, and
if there had been any honor among the
Prince's guests for their_host's sake and
for the sake '. of fheir profession they
would have held their tongues. But they
went out into the highways and byways
and cried their comrade's shame and their
own indignation. Some told of it tragic
ally, some comically, but none of them
told it very carefully, and needless to say
the gossipy papers made the most of it.
This is where Albert Edward proved his
title to be "Prince of good fellows."
When he saw what had happened he
drove straight up to Bond street and pur
chased a box for the next entertainment
at which his indiscreet guest was to ap
pear. He drove back and asked the Prin
cess to excuse herself from any social
engagement which she might have, and
the Prince and Princess of Wales made
themselves particularly prominent in tha
front of that box and effusively applaud-
While as a leader of fashion the King
Ismail powerful, he is good natured to
a degree .with regard to the imitation of
his hats, coats, the cut of his collars
or the pattern of his sleeve links.
When his position and the exigencies
of his life are taken into consideration,
Jl cannot be said that the King is ex
travagant with his clothes; and perhaps
it is the fact that he possesses the largest
wardrobe in the world of uniforms and
stats robes that induces him to restrict
himself in the matter of what may be
called mufti. But what is wise econo
my in a King might be undue extrav
agance in a subject. It must be. remem
bered that, as a matter of course, the
King's wardrobe includes every variety
of attire for ordinary and special use.
so that suits for wear in town or adapted
ed the performer whose Indiscretion they
deemed had been punished enough with
out the interference of his fellows.
His strong objection to snobbery and
cheap notoriety has been abundantly dis
played in Â¦ other ways. It Is commonly
supposed that his admiration and encour
agement supported- the cult of the "pro
fessional beauty." The ladies who were
known to the public by that term were
many of them members of circles in
which King Kdward. as the Prince of
Wales, moved; but it is not generally
known that when, after a time, the
Prince found that the profession of beau
ty was becoming scandalous In its vul
garity and advertisement, he decided to
put a stop to the whole business by re
fusing to accept or to know those who
were making a trade of their good looks.
In the â¢ same way the "bazaar mania"
and the ridiculous means resorted to by
smart society ladies and well-known ac
tresses to extort money from their pa
trons received a severe check from the
Prince of Wales, who. on one occasion.
was kind enough to lend his personal
patronage to a-' great fancy fair got
up at the Albert Hall.
In the course of the afternoon he hon
ored the refreshment stall by his pres
ence, and asked for a cup of tea. The
tea was being sold at a figure sufficient
ly exorbitant to â¢ cover the calls of char
ity, but the fair vender, thinking to cover
herself, with glory, before handing him
the cup, drank from it herself, saying:
"Now the cup of tea will cost 5 guineas."
The Prince gravely paid the money ask
ed, handed back the tea and said: "Will
you please give me a clean cup?"
It is needless to say that the quiet
snub greatly helped to suppress all such
devices as were resorted to by ladies of
a certain section of society.
However, from those whom he likes
well. King Edward is very tolerant ot
familiarity. On one occasion ' Lord
Charles Beresford was compelled to re
fuse one of his invitations to dinner
with a telegram, which ran: "Sorry
cannot come; lie to follow," which
tickled hi3 Royal Highness immensely.
Of course, according to the popular no
lion his Majesty's long career has been
one continual round of pleasure, but the'
fact is. King Edward is and has been
one of the hardest working mortals In.
the whole world. Even his pleasures have
been eo hedged about with ceremony that

PERSONALITY OF
THE MAN
SOON TO BE
CROWNED RULER
OF ENGLAND.
But in the stalking of big game, such as
crocodiles on the Nile and tigers and wild
elephants In India, his Majesty won hla
greatest reputation as a sportsman. Dur
ing one week of hunting in the Jungle he
killed seventeen tigers ta such grand style
and with such superb poise and coolness
that even the natives, accustomed as they
are by generations of careful training to
hunt such dangerous game, were aston
ished.
But it is in all the social accomplish
ments with which the imagination invests
a Prince that King Edward excels. As
master of the dance he is par excellence.
He likes a love story and never misses an
opportunity of making a good marriage
for a plain girl or a younger son. of patch
ing up a quarrel between a pair of lovers,
or of bringing a foolish young husband
and wife together. Truly what further
accomplishments need a man hare to win
the title of "first gentleman of England"?
However.it is the love of shooting that
may be said to be a positive passion with
King Edward. A royal battue, or big
shoot, is an Important event, that occurs
only a few times during each year. Hla
Majesty is considered by good judges the
best shot in the kingdom. His most suc
cessful efforts are overhead shots at rock
eters. The sight when the driven birds
finally rise with a whirr of wings Just
above the guns is most extraordinary and
is only to, be seen on' estates that are as
carefully preserved as those of the King.
And his bags are simply astounding. Since
1SS0 the bags have grown from ten to six
teen thousand, this latter figure being
reached in the bis shoots in I$}f5-8G. The
average result of a single shoot is nowa
days- between 2000 and 2000 head of game,
of which the greater number are pheas
ants. When a clearance of rabbits is nec
essary at Wolverton, a large party of first
rate shots is invited, and 6000 are generally
killed.
for smart and quiet race meetings arÂ«
In abundance.
The King holds complimentary naval
and military appointments in most coun
tries, and each necessitates four uni
forms, comprising full dress, undress,
mess kit and overcoat, and nearly fifty
helmets, swords and uniform belts, be
sides the, full robes of Knights of tlw
Garter, Saint Patrick and the Thistle. Of
orders of chivalry the King possesses
nine that are English and fifty that are
foreign. All of these have their respec
tive collars and decorations. Besides these
his JIajesty has full regalias of various
degrees of ilasonry. It will thus be seen
that the King's wardrobe Is literally Im
mense.
Though verv democratic, and even tol
erant of familiarity, when the Stag
wishes to remain incept nothing: vexes him
more than to be addressed cr treated as
a royal personage. Under the alias of
"Mr. and Mrs. Williams" the King and
Queen have often gone into che poorer
quarters of their realm and the slum3 o*
London and Investigated for themselves
the condition of the poor. On one occa
sion the King had arranged to lunch
quietly at the house of a friend, but hl3
astonishment and vexation were extreme
when on driving up at the hour appointed
he found rod cloth laid down everywhere,
the hall filled with bowing servants and
the drawing-room overflowing with gues:s
who had been bidden in a hurry ""to meet
the Prince of Wales."
In nothing has the King proved hi3 title
to be "first gentleman of England" so
much as in the line of sport. In the
"sport of kings" he has been known for
several decades as the "King of sports,""
though in breeding and running race
horses of the first class his Majesty only
followed In the footsteps of a long Una
of royal patrons of the English turf. In
deed, it is his patronage of the turf and
his unswerving love of fair play that has
raised the Anglo-Saxon to the proud emi
nence of the greatest sportsman In the
world. There is scarcely a pastime or
sport that the King has not some knowl
edge of. for he not only likes to see
everything wherever he goes, but also, as
far as possible, to try his skill at any
fresh game that he meets with.

scene of the tight I happened to be quite
near to Fisher. He said that he "r-had
hidden the gun under a heap of cocoa

where about here, and if It was n>:t in
that heap it was- in the next one.' Sure
enough, young George Reid, kicking at
the next heap, discovered the gun. It
was rusty, of course, but just-in the po
sition where It had been placed.
"Fisher showed me where the gun was
when Lieutenant Landsdale was first
shot. It was on the side of the road,
near the wire fence. The ejector of the
gun had failed to work, an empty case
had remained in the breech, and, a full
â¢ cartridge coming up, had caused a jam.
Lieutenant Landsdale was sitting down
close to the fence," trying to clear the
gun. when he was shot in the leg. Then
he told Fisher to take the body of the
gun and hide it. This F'sher did, with
the result that ho was able to point out
the spot weeks afterward.

TT!..-Â«-.-Â».-T71_l_Â«r--T3-.-%.T.TV-A_-cr :-Tt'A.T-T.H NEE-DEEP in June! That is the
time when ' the beauty of the
world is overwhelming: and when
every one who cares a fig for
Nature best likes to pay his hum
ble respects to her. Everything that
springs from the soil is in its glory and
the dainty flowers that carpet the earth
form the pageant of summer.
Then why stay Jn the city when the
earth is in all her glory? And why visit
some fashionable watering- resort where
each and every day passes much like the
other and where no thought is given to
health, hygiene or nature. Nothing, but
the bustle that characterizes every day In
the city.
It does not necessarily mean a Ions
journey, a small fortune and a month
or, so to rest oneself in. Not at all. and
if such were the case the great majority
d people would be chronic cranks. It
does mean a good two weeks spent in a
hearty rational way and in some quiet
nook out of the clutches of civilization
aiid its ardent followers.
Those retreats are not difficult to find,
for there are any number of them within
a stone's throw from home. Mill ' Valley
is one of the nearest and yet seemingly
one of the farthest from ! the cit y. There
are delightful little canyons and tiny
proves that were made, to all intents an>1
purposes, for campers and loungers. The
climate is milder and the air is laden
with the perfume of the thousand and
one flowers whose only duty is to bloom
tind bloom again.
. Is it not better to take a few treatments
from Mother Earth than It is to pour
down pills and powders and bottles anfl
bottles of nasty medicine? And after all
to be well does not tax the pocketbool?
half as much as sickness does. What. if
1 summering does seem a little - high
priced? It is a splendid investment.

HAUNTS FOR
CAMPERS

10THE old saying. "There is nothing new
under the sun" Is being used every
day, and every day it Is being veri
fied, seemingly.
See -what the latest craze is in
furniture. Ttie old style that *as used
because .necessity demanded it in the â¢
early times Is resurrected now because
some wealthy woman caught a glimpse
of It and wanted something really new
and original.
Way back during ths sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries such furniture was
made and used by the monks and friars
in the missions and monasteries through
out Central and South America, Mexictf
and Southern California.
It takes but a trip to Santa Barbara
and a few minutes spent in their mission
to thoroughly convince one of that.
Every stick there 5s modeled after the
good old style,' and the quaint furnishing
Is refreshing after all the carving, uphol
stery and gingerbread work tliait makes
up so much of our modern household be
longings.
At present the "mission furniture" â¢Â«
very popular, and it is likewise very ex-
I>ensive. The queer lines and the interest
ing construction of the genuine jjieces will
never become tiresome, for 1T1 turniture,
as In all else, simplicity is the chief
beauty.
There is a restfulness Ko the eye that is
connected with this style that Is found in
absolutely no other kind. The lines an
all straight, but they are seldom, if ever,
angular. The massive strength, solid
comfort and great durability should make
it sought after, if there was no other rea
son; but housekeepers see something else,
and that something amounts to a great
deal in their eyes. There is no elaborate
carving or geometrical curves that serve
as dust catchers, and no matter how
careful one is the tiny particles fly about
aimlessly, and finally light right in the
hardest spot to get at.
Strong-grained native ash, stained ,a.
dark green or a light green, as one's
fancy dictates, has been chosen as the
wood best fitted for this simple style. Any
material that is hard and that will stani '
the wear and tear of years is what has-. Â¦
been used, and what would be chosen "
stain if necessity put in her order. â¢â¢ -'"" '
Rushes, flax and leather make cleati,
good and durable seats, and all the work
Is finished In the plainest, frankest way
possible, with every nail and joint show
ing plainly. There Is nothing concealed.
and the prdducts arc merely the outcome*"
of good workmanship and a little thought.
The plaster houses made in the old
mission style of architecture are becom
ing popular again, and right cool an3
comfortable they are, too. And what a
mine they do open to the artistically in
clined. Everything in connection with
them is a picture in itself. The ceilings are
heavily timbered in a duli red or brown;
the walls arc in sanded plaster, frequent-"
ly studded with nails to form a design or
decoration. The floors should -be of con- -
crcte or tiles', \>ut in these modern houses
the flooring is more often of a hard wood,
stained a deep green or left its natural
color, and, says Mr. Fredericks of Fred
ericks & Co., to be correct the funny low
beds should seem bat a few inches from
the- floor, the massive dresser should takÂ«

, The general utility all-around sort of
piece is a combination seat, hall, table
and box. When the back is upright it
forms the back of the seat; when It is
perpendicular it is the top of the table,
and the box is the seat or lower shelf at
any and all times.' Those old monks were
wise, for that one piece of workmanship
proves that they could adapt themselves
to every rtlsn m me cookdooK. but that w
a. mistake. Flannel cakes, at least, axe
much better for the absence of eggs. ;
and their belongings to almost anything 1 .
The chairs are queer looking articles and
all decidedly different. Each am 1 every one

fulness. One looks like a cracker box,
with slats put across in a. criss-cross
fashion for the back. The seat is made
of strips of leather. all tacked on with a
fancy thumb screw. One piece of wood
runs through from one side to the other
and is roughly fastened, in fact it looks
as though it were not very staple and
firm, but- in reality it will stand rough
usage for a lifetime.
The rockers are the quaintest of all the
mission furniture. They are so* squatty
ffind low that a tall person could not be
comfortable in them. The arms are low
and wide; broad enough, in fact, to act
as an impromptu reading table or a" writ
ing desk. The leather back is held in
place by two pieces of leather tied loose
ly. And the rockers! In some of the
chairs one would almost need a spy glas3
to locate them, but withal ; they are as
cczy.and restful as can be, big enough to
stow two people away nicely and still
have a little space to spare.
There are bookcases and combination
what-nots, some with glass and eorne
without, again there are shelves of books
or for anything that they might be needed.
There are .tables, any number of them,
and all different sizes; there are buffeta
and even sideboards, but they are rad
ically changed these daysâ so much so
that" the- pious brothers would never
recognize their work and would be prop
erly scandalized. Perchance they wouldL
hold up their hands in horror to see their*
honored labor turned into wine cabinets,
card tables and even "drinking chairs. /So
iar as they could, see they would. be m
no way connected with the church or any
of its. forms. ;
Something new for gentlemen is known
as a cellarette. .The exterior looks for all
the world like a harmless music cabinet,
but the inside looks like a well stocked
wine cellar. A revolving stand with
niches for bottles, turns here and there as
one pleases, while above is a shelf to be
filled: with all sorts and conditions . of
glasses". Then comes a drawer for cigars
and cigarettes and tucked away, in the
plainest possible way is a glass sliding
shelf which was put there for the 'express
purpose of mixing drinks.
It is one of the neatest articles that
has been turned out for a long lime and it
has filled a long felt need, for fellows

The one article that has been modified
to meet the requirements of a' modern 1
home is the hall clock. Every one agrees
as to that. It is six feet high. and may
be carved just as much as one's pocket
book will permit. Some of them are made
with four oak posts and. right smart they
are, too. They look quite at home in a
large home and they, appear equally et
case in a more humble one.

need, ever be just alike. But in buying
it; remember one thing, that "the monks
fashioned all that they made in the sim
plest w-ay possible and therefore the lines
of the true old "Mission Furniture" must
needs be very simple.
5O simple a dish as custard may well
serve as text for a talk on the
blundering use of eggs by the or
dinary housekeeper. Of course,
every one knows the old rule for a plain
custard: One tablespoonful of sugar and
one egg to a cup of milk, with flavoring
to taste, and seme prefer to put in more
eggs. All. perhaps, think they make a3
good custard as is possible to produce.
But very few realize just what it is that
makes for excellence in this dishâ that it
is the yoiks, not the whites, on which It
diper.ds. Unless added at the last as a
sort of meringue or frosting the whito3
should be left out altogether, for the al
bumen adds nothing to the custard, heneo
the use of the whites is pure extrava
gance. Corr.starch or batter puddings,
however, are improved by the addition of
whipped up whites, which give them a
frothy character.
In ice cream the yolks cf eggs are- the
only part to use. The white3 may be ad
vantageously saved for meringues, caka
and othtr dishes that require their use.
Cake, indeed, depends very much on the
whites for its fineness and lightnessâ angel
rake and white cake, for example. So
does sunshine cake, only enough yolks be
ing used to' produce the desired color.
.Whcn'eggs are expensi-ve angel cake is
a luxury, true. But at IS cents a dozen
eggs are cheap enough for any cake
baker. The whites only being used, the
yelks should be carefully covered and
utilized in some 7 of the many desirable
waysâ for croquettes and egging meats
and fish, for instance. ; Bread or cracker
crumbs. combine much better in a yolk of
e?s mixture than in that made by adding:
-the water or milk to whites of eggs. Frit
ters and codfish balls call for yolks rather
than whites.
Now. about whipping the whites of
egsrs. Do you know that too much whip
ping is as much to be guarded against as
too little? Too stiff whipping will result
in making cake tough. The fault is very
much in the kind of whipper most of ua
possess. Jt is very good for making
mayonnaise dressing, but too rough for
whipping whites 01* eggs in eakeinakJn^
A French whip is much to be preferred.
For the icii:;; on cakes it is not desirable
to whip the whites of epgs. as this oper
ation causes air cells to form, and the
frosting in consequence is rough. In
boiled icing, however, it makes no differ
ence whether the whites are whipped or
not. Perhaps, on .the whole, it is best
that they should be whipped.
Eggs' are not desirable at all in flannel
cakes. Many housekeepers seem to go on
the principle that eggs are indispensable

THE GOOD OLD "MISSION" FVRNITVREsupenor win prosper and increase more
than the children of the inferior. -There
will be a multiplication of the fittest in
stead of a multiplication of the unfit
test."
That passage shows at once the strength
and the. weakness of the author's sys
tem. He will have the people get educa
tion for their children as best they may,
but would deny them the right to com
bine as citizens of a municipality and pro
vide for education by joint effort and tax
ation. He maintains that "If" character
be inherited an individual struggle for ed
ucation would result In an advantage to
the best, but He ignores the virtue of the
"if." j Experience has shown that char
acter' is not inherited. The children of
successful men are not often found work
ing with their father's vigor nor walking
in his paths; while in our American his
tory the republic has round most of its
greatest men among the children of
parents whose lives were marked by no
kind of material success.
The volume, however, is by no means
quaint humor and bits of human nature
study have brought many imitators into
the field. Never comes a good thing but
it must be overdone and cheapened by
the efforts of those, who, lacking origin
ality, must make up for a paucity of new
ideas by following N where they cannot
lead. An example of this is the appear
ance in book form, from the press of R.
V. Fenno & Co., New York, of "The
Fables of the Elite," by Dorothy
Dix. These fables are simply a cheap
imitation of the really good work of
George Ade, illustrated by some fairly
clever drawings from the pen of Swinner-
Literary Notes.
"Lays for Little Chaps" has been se
lected for the title of a volume of poems
by A. J. Waterhouse, to be issued shortly
by the New Amsterdam Book Company.
Mr. Waterhouse Is as well known west of
the Rocky Mountains as Eugene Field
and James Whitcomb RHey are in the
frenzy . of tmpaUence in the sound. As; it

quick gleam of relief. , ' . ,
At the same instant, Armand swerving far
forward, wounded his antagonist . in the right
wrist, and, Foy's fingers relaxing on the htlt,
with a sweeping: twiet sent his sword rattling
a good ten feet away.
Fey was after it to snatch it up, with a
snarl more like a wild beast than a man, when
an officer, at a gallop, leading three soldiers,
broke into the clearing and spurred fairly
between.
"Stop!" he phouted, out of breath. "Stop!
In the Governor's name!" .
Armand tossed his sword to the ground.
"Hell and fury!" foamed Foy. as he sprang
back, slashing at the horse's legs. "Out of
the .way, damn you!" The animal plunged
aside, and Foy came at Armand- like the mad
man he was.
The officer threw himself off the horse too
late, as Henry rushed forward. Armand stood
perfectly still, his hand pressed to his side,
where a stain was spreading crimsonly among
the white ruffles.
"Bear witness," Rolph said with coolness,
turning to the soldiers, "that Captain Foy is
not himself for liquor." * .
The central historical figure of the book
is Patrick Henryâ and Miss Rives has
drawn the character well. Of him she has
said :
"He was the greatest Virginian that
ever lived. He married the daughter of
a tavern-keeper, wore buckskins, failed in
business and could not make a living as a
lawyer. But he knew. His brain looked
even further ahead than Washington's.
Ever since I began to write I have dream
ed of putting himâ homely face, leather
breeches and allâ into a novel. And now
I have done it."
She has done itâ and she has done it
well!
Her historical characters are handled
with all the skill that was evident in
Winston Churchill's work on the char
acters of Lincoln and Grant in "The
Crisis." In fact, speaking of "The Crisis,"
"Hearts Courageous" has much more of
life, spirit and good story in it than is to
be found in Churchill's work.
Miss Rives still paints her stage set
tings with rather a lurid brush; for ex
ample take the following clipped at ran-'
dom:
As they rode the rose-stained east turned
kingfisher color and then amber, and the' sun
splashed the clouds with pools of burnt yellow
and gold till they went in a glory. It grew,
in a burst, to-day, grass-sweet and sullen, sod
den with-thÂ© wet Bmell of sycamore. For a few
moments Anne was drunk with the motion â
the rush through tingling, dew-wet air.
- ' 'Â¦ . â¢ â¢ â¢
Beyond the yellow clay bank the shore glow
ed in a violet-green dazzle of foliage â a flamu
of, amethyst and pink, and over all the sun
hung hazy, like some splendid dream rose,
strewing its petals upon a bay of tinted glass.
The bank behind the wharf was a fringe of
negroes, their vacant-minded happiness shak
ing out laughter as wind shakes blossoms from
a locust tree. The gay-colored turbans bobbed
like variegated poppies on a breezy day.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"I," she answered more lightly, "was think
ing of bow the frost has eet the woods afire.
Saw you ever such copper-rÂ«ds and russet
golds. And those wedges of pink rockâ they
have the look of raspberries crushed in curdled
milk. God is spendthrift of his hues."
*Â¦'-'* *
Somewhere far away a whippoorwill began to
call â a liquid gurgle through the clasping dark.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The sky was a clean, cold steel. Early twi
light blended' the delicious mingled-brown' and
dull orange of the. singed fields with the waxen
â¢ green of the red-pricked holly bushes, and the
frozen glare of ice ponds shone bleakly in tho
stubble. Above the collar of her great coat
Anne's face was rosed with the tang of the
frosty air which turned the breath to ghost
faint smoke curdles. Their steps broke crisply
through the crusted rime, and from the fields
came the tinkling of belled sheep nipping
. withered grass and the whirr of shy partridges
ecuddlng through rustles of weeds dry. as dead
wasps.
â¢ *. â¢
If that is not lurid color thrown on with
a free hand it would be hard to say what
it is. But then if such descriptions strike
one as too vivid, they are very easily
The lieutenant wedged an exclamation amid
the flick and scrape of steel. Foy's face was
beccme a welter of sweat and rage. This was
a ecrt of fighting new to him. He tried every
attack, every feint, double engage, coupe
Now h" became of a sudden winged. He
turned, circled, was here and there with the
rapidity of an insect. The fight turned this
way and that, crushed the bushes, was all
over the ground. There was a maze of prick
ing, whirling arrows of sulphur-colored flani2
in the moonlight. Foy's breath was coming
hoarsely in his throat like' that of a strangled
dog. Armand began to laugh outright as he
thrust and parried, j
Armand had changed his tactics. He still
had the /appearance of looseness and lack . of
close defense, but, strangely enough, Foy's
point, though wielded by the redoubtable
swordsman that he was, had not so much as
? lit a ruffle of his shirt. He was untouched,
immaculate, careless and debonair.
The Frenchman'* blade, beating up a flan
connade, had nicked a crimson gagh on Foy's
shoulder.
â¢ The latter, smarting from the prick, and en
raged beyond measure, came on again \ cursing,
his chin set forward from his neck and a fleck
cf foam . on his lips. -
"End the cub, Foy," cried Rolph with aa
cath, "and let us to town. Tou could have
spitted him forty times!"
"By heaven!" suddenly burst out Henry.
"Bravo'." ;'Â¦ ..Â£>
Armand returned with a 6top-tnrust. parried
a lunge and answered by a riposte. Then, for a
moment, there was nothing but the du-tac-an
tac of ellm eteel, cutting wayward blue- white
flashes where the milky light caught its edge.
So Indeed It seemed. Foy was a brute and
he fought like one, with face distorted and
breath rattling with rage. He came on with
the lunge of a hunter at a. boar, his blade
hate-heavy, and the very fury of his rush sent
the young; Frenchman back to the verge of
the bubhes.
The Jieutenant stood close to Henry, his lips
parted, watching. "They say Foy was taught
of Angelo," he whispered, "and that the pupil
could best his master. Tour friend is in evil
case."
A pain came into Henry's dark eyes and a
paler tinge to his cheeks. He groaned inward
ly as Foy suddenly came at Armand, press
ing him back in a furious chasse-croSsee â first
the right foot forward, then the left.
A maitre d'escrime might have seen in his
action some of the freedom and directness which
later gave Bertram), the greatest fencing
master of Europe, the surname of the ' 'Terri
ble." But to the watchers it seemed to be ut
terly without method â barren of rule â to be
loose, uncontalned. He possessed the appear
ance of a child at careless play with a serpent,
not conscious of Its sinister Intention.
Foy's attack was wonderfully strong. He had
the trick of carrying the head well back and
resting the weight of his body upon the left
leg â a sign of one whose learning had been
without masks. The other's method was as
different from that of his antagonist as night
from day. He fought far forward, engaging
much with the point.
"'En garde!" cried Armand, turning sharp
ly, and the two blades rang together with a
clash.
As an example of her power of narration
here is the duel between Armand and
Captain Foy, the aide of Lord Dunmore.
Armand is seconded by none other than
Patrick Henry:
Foy's voice broke in, sneeringly wrathful.
"Are we come to string beads?"
Later Jarrat is to appear on the scene
and learning of this love affair is to make
all kinds of trouble. Armand is of such
a nature that rather than avoid difficulty
he seeks itâ and he finds it in plenty. Miss
Rives keeps her hero's hands pretty full.
There are misunderstandings all around
and the climax finally comes when Ar
rrand believes himself to have been be
trayed by Anne; this is when Jarrat has
finally played his trump card and the
Marquis is denounced as being an im
postor. To tell whether Anne is really
true to Armand or not would be to hint
at the ending of the story and spoil It for
its readers; sufficient is it to say that Miss
Rives will hold ( your interest until the
last page and that she makes the endng

cording to all etchics of artistic work.

Under the title "Facts and Comments,"
Herbert Spencer presents to the world
a volume of short cs?ays dealing with a
wide variety of questions and reasserting
the principles with which his name has
been so long associated.
Herbert Spencer's Last Book.
The Leopard's Spots.
Its readers will find that "The Leop
ard's Spots" really means "The Ethiop
ian's Skin," for the negro in the South,
and the problem of his destiny hover' like
black shadows over nearly every chapter.
Thomas DIxon Jr., a Southern man, has
written this book from a purely Southtrn
"point of view, evidently intending it as
a justification of the disfranchisement of
i he negro. It is a political argument built
upon a love story â each as impassioned
as the other.
To the hearts of all who love a loverâ
and (that's all the world, they sayâ the
story of the love of Charles Gaston and
Sailie Worth will appeal. Theirs was no
modern, lukewarm affection, with things
tied to it, but the good, old-fashioned kind
cf love, taking no account of obstacles,
but pushing resistlessly on toward the
goal of matrimony, utterly overwhelm
ing a father's ill-advised wrath and op
position.
The story, begins at the . cjose of the
Civil War, at which time Charles Gaston
is but a child. The scene is laid 'mainly
'n North Carolina, and the reader is tak
en through the stormy times of the re
construction period and subsequent pol
itical convulsions down almost to the
present day, the pages of the book crowd
ed with eventful action.
Some years before the conclusion of tho
story the hero, Charles Gaston, who,
though poor, is of good family, falls in
!ove with Sailie Worth, the beautiful and
brilliant daughter of a. rich ex-Confed
erate general, and asks her hand in mar
riage. Sallie's father, at first acquiescent,'
Â¦ Is soon led, through false reports of Gas
ton's character, to interpose strenuous
objections to the marriage. But when
Gaston makes a great speech- before the
State .convention and ort- the strength of
I it - is ."nominated Govern p or,".7jt.he i old
general gives in,' and'; \6nce'- more con
. eenting to the marriage,, the invitations
are issued. Â¦ On', receipt of a letter, in
forming him that Gaston and Sailie had
l.een married some time before in the jail,
where Gaston was lying incarcerated on
a false accusation, the irascible old gen
eral flies into a passion again, and has to
be resubdued by Sallie's diplomacy, and
then, that the invited guests may not be
disappointed, on the day that Charles
Gaston Is inaugurated Governor of North
Carolina he is again married to Sailie
Worth. (Published by Doubleday, Page &

royalists v.ho are inclined to give help

The first sixty pages of the book may

narrative is concerned.but they have their
part in the etory as a whole to give the
atmosphere and condition of the timesâ
those days when the seed of liberty had
just been planted In the breasts of the
colonists who were later to fight for their
freedom and establish these great United

WRITES A HISTORICAL NOVEL.
The most remarkable pictures of fish in
action which have yet appeared are in
cluded in the volume "The Giant Fish of
Florida," by J. Turner-Turner, which J. B.
Llpplncott Company have just published.
This book, by an ardent fisherman and
naturalist, recounts experiences in tack
ling the biggest and gamiest fighters
against which the salt water fisherman
has a chance to*exercise hi3 strength and.
skill, and is full of information as well aa
entertainment. The part which deals
with tarpon fishing is especially sugges
tive. How Mr. Turner secured his re
markable pictures is not the least Inter
esting feature of his book, yet he has re
produced the effect of great fish swim
ming beneath the surface of the seaâ
which it would be Impossible to obtain in
actualityâ with a likeness to life and an
action which are absolutely convincing,
and this without employing a single
mounted specimen.

Those who read "Hearts Courageous"
may be Interested in learning that there
really was such a person as "Charles
Armand"â not, however, "Charles Louis
Armand, Marquis de la Trouerie," but
Charles Trefin Armand, Marquis de la
Rouaire. He was a French soldier, born
in Fougeres, France, in 1751, and died near
Lambelle in 1793. While quite young he
entered the Garde du Corps In Paris, but
fought a duel about an actress and. was
dismissed from the service. In conse
quence of this he left France and came to
the American Colonies, where he volun
teered in the cause of the Revolution and
received from Congress a commission as
colonel under the name of Charles Ar
mand. He fought -in many engagements
and was with Lafayette in New Jersey.
In 1781, becoming dissatisfied with the pro
motions in the army and seeing no chance
of advancement, he returned to France,
procured clothing and accouterments'
from his own means, and crossed the At
lantic again In time to participate in the
victory at Yorktown. In 1783 Congress
conferred on him the rank of brigadier
general. Later he returned to France and
became . ah actor in the French revolu
tion, taking part with the Royalists of
La Vendee. At the time of the death of
Louis XVI he was a fugitive, but engaged
in secret operations for a revolt. The
execution of Louis gave his system such
a shock that he died soon after from a
nervous malady. It is said that he was
urbane and polished in manner, an elo
quent and persuasive speaker, a gallant
leader and a man greatly beloved. So
reads history, but what Miss Rives has
to tell us of him is a deal more enter
taining.
Upon the question of state education he
says: "If supply and demand are allowed
free play in the intellectual sphere as in
the economic sphere, and no hindrance is
put in the way of the naturally superior,
education must have an effect widely dif
ferent from that describedâ must conduce
to sociaL stability as well as to other
benefits. 'For if those of the lower ranks
are left to get culture for their children
aÂ« best they v may, just aa they are left
to get food and clothing for them, it
must, follow that the children of the su
perior will be advantaged; the thrifty
parents, the energetic, and those with the
highest responsibility, will buy education
for their children to a greater extent than
will the improvident and the idle. And
if character is inherited, then the average
result must be that the children of the

hardly fail to attract widespread atten

works that have preceded it from the
same exhaustless mind, this one will seem
slight and of little value, but it Is not
without its importance and significance.
It bears witness to the fact that the ven
erable student is carrying his old age
serenely and fronts an antagonistic world
with undiminished courage. He denounces
state education, Jingo patriotism, party

filled with essays of protest against the
tendency of the world toward govern
ment regulation of life. Many of the es
rays deal with subjects of general inter
est like music, style, weather forecasts
and a wide variety of miscellaneous
topics. A particular interest attaches to
the concluding essay, "Ultimate Ques
tions." Spencer says: "For years past
when watching the unfolding of buds in
the spring there has arisen the thought,
shall I ever again see the buds unfold-
Now that the end is not likely to be long
postponed there results an increasing
tendency to meditate upon ultimate ques
tions." Concerning the issue of life after
death, he says: "The consciousness itseir
âwhat la it while it lasts? and what be
comes of it when it ends? We can only
infer that it is a specialized and individ
ualized form of that infinite and eternal
energy which transcends both our knowl
edge and our imagination, and that at
death its elements lapse into the Infinite
and eternal whence they were derived."
That is the great philosopher's last
word. The little book will be found full
of wise counsel and earnest thoughts. It
merits and will receive a wide attention.
Those who read it will see that the es
"says are slight, but those who are discern
ing will perceive they have come from a
master mind that has lost none of its
wisdom with advancing years. (Published

J. Scott Leary's way of saving a woman
from drowning looks like no trick at all.
It makes you want to get in and do it
yourself, even if you can't swim a stroke.
All he does. is to throw one arm around
her neck, well under the chin, so as not
to choke her. This brings the face above
the water, and what is more Important,
gives the woman no chance to clutch the
swimmer. Try as she may, in her Insane
effort to help herself, she can get no hold.
There she must lie with her head tucked
close against his shoulder, while with one
free arm and two strong legs he drive3
his way through the water, bearing her
along.
"Of course, when you go toward her she
will reach out for you and grab you wher
ever she can- get a hold, probably about
the neck," said Mr. Leary. "And the
trick is to catch her arms before her
hands have tightened like a vise and with
a quick duck get your head under her arm
and turn her about so she can't get a
chance at you.
"It's a tussle sometimes, for you never
can tell what a drowning person is going
to do. They do such queer things, both
men and women, and a man hasn't much
time to think how to act.
"Some think the best way is. to tow a
woman along by the hair. It i3 possible, 1
of course, but in the first place you can't
keep her head out of water, and in the
second place she is likely to turn around
and grab you.
"As for having her put her hand on your
shoulder, that Is only practicable where
a woman is tired, not -if she Is drowning.
If she Is drowning she has not sense
enough to merely put her hand there and.
not try to get a stronger hold. In fact,
the only . ' safe way is the one I have
shown." . . ... .:. .

It is an outgrowth of hypnotism.
A Jesuit priest named KIrchner startled
the scientific world 'by stating he could
hypnotize hens. His method was as fol
lows: The first taJng.he did was to firmly
tie the hen's legs together in order to pre
vent it escaping; he then laid it' on a
table, and after waiting a short time to let
its struggles cease - drew a chalk line
across the table parallel to a,line passing
through the hen's eyes.; The, legs were
then : untied and usually the hen would
remain quite indifferent, lying in a state
of complete passivity for five minutes or
longer, sometimes even as. long- as half
an hour. At the end of the above time the
Influence seemed' to be suddenly arrested,
the hen returning to normal activity with
a sudden jump, as if startled in sleep. The
same symptoms are observed in all ani
mals thus influenced, and it. Is to this
state of passivity that- the ' name "hyp
nosis" has been applied, although it is not
hypnotism In the strict sense of the word.
It has been practically demonstrated that
the chalk line used by Klrctier in hypno
tizing his hens. Is not entirely necessary.
Merely holding a hen firmly in one posi
tion for a short time is sometimes suf-
flcient to bring on the state of hypnosis.
This extraordinary quiescent state can
be brought about in the cat, dog, rabbit,

DROWNING persons ought to be

The rule should hold good until
drowning persons learn how to be
have when they are being saved.
There are plenty of good men willing to
go a-rescuing, but every time one does it
he leaves his chances for getting back
alive in a very small package on the bank.
All because drowning persons go crazy.
Their mania is to be saved, to be saved
at once, -to be saved at any cost-
It takes nerve to face a strangling,
etruggling creature with a maniacal gleam
Jn his eye and that one frantic thought in
his mind.
Man or womanâ it's all one. A drown
ing man is as helpless, as frenzied, as
hard to save as a woman. But there is
a way of doing it. if the drowner will
gi\-e the rescuer half a chance..
Every swimmer has his own way, some
times a good one, sometimes only the
best he knows. Often It is necessary to
resort to rude, evien heroic measures, for
with one who Is past thinking-save that
one desperate thought of being saved
and with every second a thing of value,
there is scant time for formality. To
knock a person on the head is hardly

such as by clapping the hands or snap

be made.
To hypnotize frogs, as for other animals,
they should be held firmly in one posi

gle violently to escape, but finally quiet
down and become motionless, except for a
few occasional movements of their le S 3
and bodies. They are then in a condition
of hypnosis, and will remain so for a
period varying from a few seconds to sev
eral hours. To hypnotize a crayfish or
crab the same, method can be employed,
and when once the hypnotic state has
been induced the subject can be made to
stand on' its head ot in any other ludi
crous position.
Some persons can hypnotize animals
better than others, but it requires patience
and perseverance to find out whether one
has an influence over animals. Sometimes
it has been done when animal3 have been

MAGIC' By all means, little girl, if you are five

The Little Sailor Hat.
The sailor hat which comes in every
summer has so many rivals this year that
cue would think it might grow discour
sed and hide its diminished shape be
hind gome of the broader and newer
etvles. .
But not so. The sailor hat, although
obscured by the tri-corncred shapes and
put out'of .sight by the natty dish and the
wonderful English walking hats, is cer
tainly here again, and one sees it. llkrf
en old friend, with its band of white or
blue ribbon and its square little crown
and rigidly becoming brim.
For several seasons past the milliners
have been trying lo g.ve their, patrons
tin* tig bow. Streamers have been intro
duced every spring and were among the
J-Jaster novelties. But they disapjK-arcd
and were not perpetuated beyond the
Eastertide. The lew who bought them
were glad to rip off the trailing ends and
in a Jew weeks Dame Fashion had gone
back to Jier strcamcrless mode.
liut this spring the streamers and tne
ribbon bow showed that they had come
to stay. They appeared upon the back
of three hats out of live and those that
did not have them offered, at least, a
]>iace for them. Now the mode is so com
n>cn that it attracts no attention beyond
a clance of admiration for its prettiness.
i.r;d almost any hat can be trimmed in
this way. ;
The Trailing Ends.
That is a feature of so many summer
hats, the ribbon bow at the back. And
It is a lecture which does not pall. It is
common yet novel, pretty and becoming,
easily constructed and universally worn.
The bis bow at the back is treated in so
many ways that one imrclly knows whtcn
to sj>ecitv as tne most tajrnionable.
For the moment me nbu<m v.nicn trims
the brim or the crown is ihe one that js
uÂ«ed for the bow at tne bac-ii. It is tied on
tup and the ends and loops tall' low. some
times almost to the nape of the neck, cov
ering the bac-K ot the head and entirely
concealing the coiffure.
If invited to the theater, for theaters
have a way of offering one attraction or
another all the year around, one can put
on a very small turban toque looped at
the back with a satin bow. In the front
the little affair dips and each side is turn
ed high. Around the brim there are big
round straw ornaments through which a
ribbon is laced. At the back this same
ribbon forms a bow on top of the hat with
*nds so arranged that they fall upon the
auir.
If asked to go to a garden party
on? can put "on one's sprigged muslin and
pally forih resplendent in waving plumes
colored satin straw; Neapolitan buckles,
chiffon chonx and Hying ribbons.
THE -woman who said that if she had
a hat she could do without a gown
is repeating her assertion.
With new hats and plenty of
them, one can be very independent.
the long feather which is stiff and -brown
Â«nd is pulled through the crownâ not the
biimâ in such a way Chat the : quill end
sticks out and also the -feather end, with
a prf-at space between.
They" trim the sailors-'-quite a littleâ th<>
imported sailorrâ for those women who
l : l r e trimrr.insr. At the back there can be
a bow with the ends r.r.d the loops hang
ing ever and the same* ribbon can thread
the crown In big. loose" ribbon stitche:v
That is oneway. Â¦"Another is to pile a
rrsp pardon nt one sicle, while around the
hat there is a crush of rose siik. This is
very becoming. And they are facing
these sailors with the tiniest little pink
r<sf-s, button roses, put on to make a
lft tie lining for the brim, like a solid fac
ing.
And then they turn up the sailor hats
plumb in the middle of. the back and
fasten .them with a big. wide silk bow of
the "made" type, with the silk cut on the
bias and with wide, slanting ends. The
front has no trimming if one can except
a rather severe band of silk folded well.
The Dish Hat.
There is a perfect craze this year for
Mhe hat which, for lack of a better name,
Is called a dish hat. It is like a sailor
hat, only a little more so. Its crown is
lower, or a great deal higher, and its brim
is always wider. It Is trimmed in simple
fashicn by draping a quantity of material
around the crown and by stitching a few
quills in the trimming.
It is an easy trimming and one that,
though not novel, is employed again and
again in the summer modes. Â¦
The raindrop satins and the raindrop
aflka are the ones that are used for trim
mi.r.g these hats. Perhaps you would call
them the polka dots. The material must
be wioe and there must be plenty of it,
enough to go around the hat, in big, loose
folds and look us though it were not
skimped in any way. Then the quills are
stuck in, rather straight, and the ma
terial is again brought into play so as to
fully drape the too.
The hat that is called the rough and
ready, and the hat which is styled the
ready to wear, are very similar. The rough
and ready Is the one that will stand all
usage; and, if it be of the right type
it is a hat that will bear rain and sum
mer snows, if snows there be, and will
positively not show the dust and dirt
To be thus immune against the worst
enemies of the season the rough and
ready must excel in durable colors. The
khaki felts are admirable and Very pret
ty, too, and beauty and durability "do not
often travel together. When found hand
in hand, one. should not forget them.
Not quite as smart as khaki is our
Rough Rider brown, but it is every bit as
becoming. Really it is more so, for the
color is warmer, and. upon light people
shis is greatly valued.
It is found in felt and In every coarse
straw, trimmed with Cuban grass straw
and with swamp straw and fancy straw
that is rough and durable.
Durable Straws.
Rrally women in general do not trust
their milliners sufficiently. One has an
abiding faith that one's milliner is try
ing to sell, the hat, and so one loses con
fidence. :
This is not right, nor is it reasonable.
The milliner Is a woman, or a man, who
Intends to sell the hat and who hopes to
in doubt what to wear there is the flower
toque. And at no time is it inappropriata.
One can wear it week day, .or Sunday, and
v/ith white or black.
It has another merit not to be ignored.
It is not expensive. I
ily about this hatâ that it is becoming'to
so many. .Geraniums are lovely, treated
, in- the same way, the flowers on top and
the yellowish green leaves around.
The summer -girl better have a -flower
hat for it is a thing that is useful. When
which they put on, one overlying the
other, like the leaves in Caesar's crown.
All around the head these leaves lie, and
at the back there is a bow of black vel
vet ribbon. " â¢ . ..'.-' â¢'Â¦ -.. â¢ â¢Â»
This is charming, and there Is one odd- -
Between the ready-to-wear hat and the
dress hat there is a great gulf fixed.'
One of them is as severe as the- other
is fanciful.
It would take a puzzle expert to un
ravel the mysteries of the trimming of a
French hat and a milliner to explain the
matter after it had been unraveled.
The clever woman who performs that
modern miracle known ae making her
own hats will find herself with a task
before her this year of uncommon serious
ness. Better by far to buy the hat and
save on some other part of .the ward
robe.
Chiffon, so long In possession of the
millinery field, still holds Its own. Silk
muslin and maline and the Btiffer fab
rics are used in hat trimmings, but how
one does go back to chiffon when one
wants something absolutely pretty.
They are trying the transparent ma
terials upon hats with very fine results.
Materials that are diaphanous are used
rell you another on some day. Therefore
it is a good plan to put one's faith in a
milliners taste and to say, "Select for
me!"
Uady Curzon, whose hats are actual
dreams in becomingness, is a woman who
trusts Iter milliner. She has one in Lon
don to whom sin- has gone for years. To
this woman she says: "I will leave it all
to your .judgment." with the. result that
the prettiest hajja are 'bought for reason
able prices.
Hut we catinot jail be* Lady Curzons and
gve ii mill ner carte blanche to ssl?ct. At
the same time we can trust to the taste
of the woman who is in trade and can be
assisted and guided by her trained judg
ment.
Hars that point ;it the front are coming
in. One notices that many of the new
straw? show this peculiarity. But let the
woman of long, straight features beware.
The hat that comes to a dip in front is
delightful upon a tHted nose, the pug and
tilts turn-up, but it makes a long, _ thin .
nose positively ugly. The classic typu
should choose some ether .style.
They arc taking the straw shapes and
turniiis them up at both side?, like tho
Knglish walking hats, but in s'ich a way
that there is a point in front. Around the
hrim there are !aid folds of silk, and tlto
quills Bland high at one side.
The plainest oÂ£ straws look dressy treat
ed to the sharply pointed front, atul one
can really lit one's self out nicely at 'tin.*
cost of a few cents.
Streamers and Ringlets.
It is a certain thing that we are going
back to streamers and ringlets. Plenty
of one and plenty of the other.-
Grandmother of 1830 wore them and. wo
shall wear them alsoâ just as grand
mother used to do.
The ringlets are the little corkscrew
kind, attached to the coiffure and allowed
to caress the neck. An irreverent girl
likened them to bolognas; they are so
round and so compact.
And so becoming!
Take a homely woman, one who is
sharp in feature or squatty in face, as
the case may be. Let her be ever so
severe, ever so afflicted with wrinkles and
ever so devoid of contour of chin, and
dress her up in ringlets, and you have a
picture at. least.
Take a pretty girl and hang a few
curls to her coiffure so that they fall'for
ward and lie upon her neck, coming just
under her prett" pink ear, and you will
make a picture that is bewitching.
Curls are coming in very fast and by
midsummer the ringlets will be as numer
ous and as fashionable as" the streamer.
And just as bewitching.
Oh, the grace of the softly floating end
and the gentle curl and the drapery, of
the veiling and of the dotted scarf!' It
makes a frame for the face and supplies
the just something which so often seems
to be lacking.
The Dress Hats. ':

stuff there is a. color.
Lace and every sort of thin<stuif. all the
materials .that are employe'.! in" gowns,
are draped over taffeta of every color un

the trimming of the handsome summer
hats. Â¦ - ...-.:. ....
Picture hats are uncommonly picture

A hat ' designed for dressy wear, upon
the riszza, nt the garden party, phaeton
driving, strolling or the like, was in white
straw, round and flat, and very sugges
tive'of grandmother's days. .
The Piazza Hat.
The thinnest of chips are revived for
these shapes and the dip clown at each
side is noticed, just, as in' the old White
garden hats.
The brim, thin, flexible and of a cream
chip, is faced with lace and maybe there
is a little fall of lace to curtain the hair.
The hat is simply trimmed by winding
its low crown with a quantity of iose
colored taffeta, and over this there is
white mull, as thin as can be," and
trimmed- with lace upon the lower edge
and the upper edge, with lace turned so
as to fall over the mull. At the neck the
mull is tied into a little scarf with lace
ends. The whole is sweetly pretty. No
other term will describe this . hat, the
type of the one worn by the' heroines of
the novels of the days of long ago.
Pink and white, rose color and cream,
arbutus and ecru, all these tones are used
in the trimming of. these hats; '.and then
there are the roses to go with th,emâ for
every hat has its rose, just as every gar
cient its flower. â¢ â¢ , ' â¢ ' ' Â¦-' '. > â¢
The woman in the garden hat, all soft
and lacy and draped in pink, is quite a
different creature. from .the woman in the
futing hat.- But to-be in >the summer"
swim she must own both and wear each
at different periods of the day. ,
They are making ingenious hat boxes,
each box fitted out with pegs and spaces
for eight v hats. .Eight -hats! -Dream; of

Mrs. James Brown Potter is doing won
derfully well, from a standpoint of looks,
in her big white hats. The great white
hat trimmed with feathers is expensive,
for one cannot use a great deal of sham
upon it. '. Â¦ . .

The very, very small hat seems to have
disappeared. It got smaller arid' smaller

larger shapes, but you do not know it is

The tiny hat may possibly be recognized

violets and rim of green leaves. This is a
pretty hat for a woman to wear, a lady

want to wear it yourself.
Girls who are handy with the needle and

plaints that Warden Wilkinson had been

ing the mail bag.
Members of . the board said that, .per
sonally, they were satisfied with what
they had seen and heard. They would not
say, however,' whether, they thought' Wil

they believed the prison was conducted
in a highly proper manner. The intima
tion was given out that the subject might
be considered at a future meeting.
Several hours were spent by. the board
in executive session to-nightat the Fol

COST OF THE WAR.
W T-T- yASHINGTON, June ZLâ
H Mi " / Debate "oh the Philippine
H /f| / Government" bill lagged in
]^f Wj/ the House to-day. There
Y . Y i were Seven j speakers â
Reeves ;Â¦- of ' Illinois and
Brorawell of Ohio for tile bill and Maddox
of, Georgia, . Dinsmore of Arkansas' and
Thayer of Massachusetts against It. Mc-
Clellan of, New York, a. son <" of the late
General, George B. McClellan, delivered, a
short but eloquent defense of the army.
Â¦ Reeves was the first; speaker. Laying
down, the proposition that the retention of
the Philippines would not' ultimately be
prejudicial to the welfare, of either the
Filipino or American people, , who should
withdraw, he undertook to show that In
stead of proving harmful ; 'to, either, our
retention of the islands would be benefi
cial to>oth.;He contrasted the condition
of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime
with their conditions now and: with what
it might be; expected to be in : the future
under the civil ' government provided by
the pending ' bill, and then proceeded to
discuss at length the benefits^which would
accrue to the American. people.'
GREAT MARKET . IN" â¢ ORIENT.
In doing so he used, a wealth of sta
tistics to show that our great- market in
the future ; would be in the Orient, and
that our position at the gateway of the
East would be of immeasurable advantage
to us.; In this connection he reviewed the
successful struggle waged j by, President
McKinley with the powers tc*
secure the "open. door", in; Asia, to show
that in'order to get the full benefit of that
great victory we must retain our present
vantage ground in the East.
Maddox of ' Georgia, who followed
Reeves, opposed the bill. The question of
whether we are to permanently retain the
Philippines, he ; said, would be ultimately
decided not by Congress,/but by the Amer
ican 'people.' â¢ Â¦" . â¢-
v "God was with us during the war with
Spain/,' he continued, "and entered into
the peace "negotiations,, but the devil
stepped in and he has been running things
ever since." _.
McClellan of New York In a brief
speech defended the army. There may
have been instances of cruelty In the Phil
ippines, he said, but there should be no
difference among Americans about up
holding our soldiers while they are under
fire.
"The army Is not and never has been
and never will be the asset of one polit
ical party." said he, amid a round of ap
plause.
The last speaker of the day was Thayer
of Massachusetts, who made a strong
anti-imperialistic speech. He said that
the military had encroached upon the
civil authority, but Insisted that the op
position to the present Philippine policy
was making no attack upon the army la
the field.
' At 5 o'clock the House took a rece3S
until 8 o'clock.
At the evening session Palmer (R.) of
Pennsylvania, in support of th* bill, de
nied that "an imperial design lurkcci in the
minds of the American people cr of thoso
responsible for the conduct of affairs in
the Philippines.
Conrby (D.) of Massachusetts insisted
that the heavy loss of life" and the enor
mous expenditure in the Philippines were
direct evidence of the imperialistic toa
dency of the party in power.
. At 10:30 the House adjourned. v' '
Dinsmore of Arkansas made an earnest
speech, appealing to both aides to weigh
well the tremendous issue which was to
be decided In the- pending legislation. De
elded one way it meant, he said, free
government and Independence for the Fil
ipinos; decided the other way It' meant
colonial subjects and a perpetual colonial
policy. He severely criticized General
Wood's course in using Cuban funds lo
influence legislation In the United States.
"The importance of tbfci undertaking
has been apparent to the business inter
ests of Denver and Salt Lake City for
some years. All over leading men have
advocated the building of a road and or
ganized industrial and flnanrt^i bodiesâ*
notably the Denver Board of Tradeâ not
only advocated a closer connection be
tween the two cities, but have from time
to time endeavored to create a sentiment
among the people for it. This important
connection established, not only will thÂ«
region traversed be developed, but It will
lead to a better connection with the entire
Northwest as far north as Idaho, Wash
ington and Orejron."
amount appropriated on account of the
war with Spain and the subsequent op
erations in the Philippines, he said, ex
ceeded J1,000,000,00<Â£ or about half of the
cost of the Civil "War. He declared that
the cost of the army In the Philippines,
including transportation, had been in ex
cess of $100,000,000 annually, and with the
reduced force would not fall much, below
$S5,000,000. If the army In the Philippine*
for the last fiscal year cost only $40,000,000.
as Secretary Root alleged, he wanted | to
know what had become of the remainder
of the $115,000,000 appropriated In the army
appropriation bill for that year.
"This road, running, you may say, north
and northwest from Denver to Salt Lake
City, is not built for the purpose of enter
ing into a competitive field, or for the
purpose of making another road to the Pa
cific Coast. It doe3 this, however, simply
because in connecting these two cities it
forms a link in a railroad chain. "What
we chiefly want Is a first-class, well-built
road between Denver and Salt Lake City.
"I have made the necessary preliminary
arrangements looking forward to the
building of the Northwestern Pacific Rail
way and this railway enterprise has now
advanced to the point where we can go
on and build it. In addition to the $2,500,
000 subscribed in the city of Denver, out
side capital has been secured to build the
line. Rails have been ordered and the
work Is going oil. At the proper time the
public will be made acquainted with the
details of the enterprise. "We purpose to
issue 120,000,000 of bonds and $20,000,000 of
stock. The stock will be preferred and
common.
The new road. It la expected by its pro
moters, will reduce the time between Den
ver and Salt Lake City by ten hours.
Work on it will be begun at once, large
orders having been placed for 80-pound
steel rails.

initial cause of the recent explosion was
at a point in No. 2 mine aforesaid not

extended from the said undefined point
throughout the greater portion , of 'No. 2

quence that the inadequate method of
watering and removing the dust left in
the mine in such a condition as to be dan

whereby the initial cause was augmented
and intensified.
"That we, the said Jury, recommend the
Government to take such steps as 1 to en
force:
"L The Installation of the most ap
proved system of watering for laying dust

PERFECTING THE DETAILS
FOB. THE BIG CONVENTION
It was about this time that he became
financially embarrassed in such a man
ner that immediate help was needed, and
almost at the last moment his uncle, Bur
den, paid up about $6000 of debts for him.
Undaunted by the failure of his theatri
cal venture a few years before, he then
undertook to show th'eater managers that
they had no real conception of the busi
ness. He leased the Coliseum , Theater at
Oakland, but after a run of a few weeks
his company was stranded. Not long after,
when his leading man failed to appear at
a performance, he quickly shaved oft his
luxuriant whiskers and played the part
himself, but so far as is known this was
his only appearance on the stage.
Some time after this MacDowell was
placed in charge of a news bureau in Los
Angeles. There he evolved a scheme of
accepting land in payment for advertise
ments and, then planned to dispose of his
holdings at a profit. The land boom at
Los Angeles was at' its height, but his
scheme failed to work out as he had
planned. Another bubble was broken, and
he came East, where he' has been

WESTERN" ENTEBPBISES.
Within a short time MacDowell bought
the Ingleside, a weekly paper, founded
nine years , before by Frank M. Pixley,
giving his note in payment. For a time
he appeared" to be on the crest of a wave
of prosperity. He fitted up his editorial
rooms elaborately and spent money free
ly to secure bright contributions. Albert
Delpit,* who at that time had an interna
tional reputation, ' contributed a weekly
Paris letter, and "Bill Â¦. Nye" and Philip
H. Welch were regular contributors. But
one of MacDowell's eccentricities was to
limit the amount of advertising to four
columns, although the Ingleside was a
sixteen-page paper. This contributed to
disaster, which overtook , the venture a
year after he assumed control, the loss
being estimated at $30,000.
MacDowell did not take kindly to dry law
books, and almost at qnce undertook his
first theatrical venture. In collaboration
with Lieutenant Field of tha United
States army he produced a play entitled
"Fettered by Fate," which he had writ
ten. The play ran only a week and was
a dismal failure. . â¢ â¢ ; .
MacDowell entered the Harvard law
school in 1874, but had been there only a
short time 'when he became involrad in
financial difficulties. He received a hand
some allowance from his father, but suc
ceeded in running heavily in debt. His
father went to his assistance,' however,
making a trip to Boston to settle up his
son's accounts, paying, it is said, about
$10,000 for him. After that experience, the
young man was placed in the law office
of General W. H. L. Barnes, then asso
ciated with Hall McAllister, in San Fran
cisco. . . ;
SOME EARLY DEBTS.
MacDowell is the son of General Irwin
MacDowell, held responsible in some quar
ters for the defeat at Bull Run in the
Civil War. His father, during the last

seen the cold earth dose over her hus
band's body; that, after it had been bur
ied for a day, the body turned over in the
coffin and ' Its face expressed Intense
agony. The repeated conviction that her
loved helpmate was lost to her forever
was pitiful to read for the officers, who
learned for the first time that the dead
man had living relatives.
"Why don't you write to me? Write
and tell me that it Is not true and that it
is nothing but a cruel dream after all.
Last Sunday night, shortly after mid
night, I had the most horrible dream. I
saw you lying cold in death before me.
Again the next night I had the same
dream and I cried out for fear. Agafn last
night the horrible vision came to me with
all. its hideous details, and I was stricken
with a feeling of terror. Then \I knew
that something had happened and that
you were lost to me." %

Read Island, 130 miles north* of this city,
is being devastated by fire, according to
a report brought to the city to-day by
passengers who arrived from the north
on board the steamer Casslar. A party
of men from Read Island reached Ven
anda yesterday with the information that
while a great deal of the timber on the
island had been destroyed some of the
forests were saved by the logging crews
having slashed avenues through the
brush, and as the air was calm the llames
were controlled to a certain extent," but
not before they had done a great deal of
damage.
Vessels crossing the gulf bring word
that great quantities of smoke are com
ing from the neighborhood of Chemainus,
and it is therefore probable that fires of
large extent are raging over there.

FIRE TAKES NEW COURSE.
"At a late hour this evening the forests
above here are burning fiercely, the
flames being driven into a belt of timber
not hitherto touched. The course of the
fire belt Is almost directly east, this di
rection gradually diverting it from the
!!&<* of railroad. The valley for miles is
brilliantly illuminated by the blazing
trees, but the most combustible material
nearby has been consumed and the fire Is
slowly receding on both sides of the river.
Its northern boundary Is now about two
miles back from the stream.
"If the wind remains in Its present
quarter twenty-four hours longer the fire
will pass the summit of the Cascades. It
Is only thirteen miles from here to Stam

timber all the way and with an upward
slope that favors the progress of the
flames. It is not thought the fire will
reach the tunnel, however, as its present
course will carry it to the divide a few
miles north of that point.
"Down at Kanaskat, twenty-two rnilcs
below here, a tract of seven square miles
is in names. At Covington, eight miles
east of Auburn, there is a fierce fire, cov
ering two square miles and rapidly
spreading."

report reached this city that a drove of
Sandow's hogs had been wallowing in the
ditch of the South Yuba Water Company,
which supplies this city with water. An
investigation by County Health Officer J.

a startling condition of affairs. They
found hogs crawling out of the ditch,
while a drove of about fifty was running

LOSS EXCEEDS A IHLUON.
SEATTLE, June 2Lâ Standing timber cf
commercial value aggregating 550,000,000
feet has been burned in flve districts
aiong the line of the Northern Pacific.
This timber comprised a splendid forest
of fir, clean of limb for a hundred feet
and all readily accessible because it grew.
within a few miles of the sailroad. Two
Cays ago these giants of the "Washington
woods reared themselves In an almost un
broken mass, covering sixty-three square
miles of territory; to-night all that re
mains of them are the smoldering, black
ened trunks, so huge that they still defy
the rapacity of the flames. The value of
the timber destroyed is placed at $1,100,000.
A. dispatch to-night to the Ledger from
Hot Springs says:
Word was received late this afternoon
that the wind had changed and the Hot
Springs Hotel was again in danger.
By working all night the men were
able to keep the fire at Buckley under
control, but several times it was thought
the entire town must go. The loss there
was small. At Kanaskat the large mill
owned by the Kanaskat Shingle Company
was standing at 6 o'clock last night, but
the outbuildings had been, burned. The
less will reach about $3000.
TOWN OF BUCKLEY SAVED.
This terrible forest fire had its origin
e.t the mill of the Mountain Mill Comr
pany, above Enumclaw. The watchman
says the flames burst out from different
portions of the mill so suddenly that
there was little time to give an alarm.
There is a suspicion that the watchman
was asleep when the fire started. The
mill was burned to the ground, together
with 1,000,000 feet of lumber and three
freight cars. The loss was estimated at
J8000.
From the mill the fire soon spread to the
surrounding forest and started in the di
rection of Enumclaw at a rapid pace. The
mill of the White River Lumber Company
was the first structure to go. The flume
vhich carries lumber to the planing mill,
besides supplying water ror the residents
of Enumclaw, was burned, leaving the
inhabitants in a precarious situation. By
concentrated work Enumclaw was saved,
but with the loss of several buildings on
the outskirts of the town.
Several freight and passenger trains on
the Northern Pacific ran through the for
est to-day at great risk. This afternoon
an east bound passenger train ran the
gauntlet of seven miles of flames and
burning cinders. The window panes in
the cars were cracked and -the paint peel

Charles Eagran of army beef fame and

baum if the latter had not been too" quick

before he could aim his revolver and the
bullet was discharged at the celling, do
ing no harm.
Eagan was thrown violently to the floor

was hushed up as far as possible, but,
nevertheless, caused a. sensation among

Special Dispatch tÂ» Ths CalL
The language and action of the boiler-makers
in the employ of the Santa Fe has been such
as. to lead us to believe that whenever anything
occurred in the relations between them and our
local officers which was not to their liking'
they sought to right it through the means of
a strike. This has been twice in evidence in
the past six months, at both Needles and San
Bernardino. It is a regrettable condition, but
one under which no corporation or individual
could successfully conduct business of any
character.
I can only say with regard to -the closing
statement that. I, have absolutely no sympathy
with the allegation that the demands of the
strikers are just." I regard them as extremely
unjust, and hold that the basis of pay now In
effect with the boiler-makers at "Needles is as
much as the company can afford to pay, and all
things considered,- -Isâ quite aa good aa the
wages paid in contiguous territory for the same
class oÂ£ service. Â¦ â¢â¢. â¢ .
The San Bernardino men, according to the
admission of their representatives on the com
mittee, struck without cause and are absolute
ly without a grievance except that they remain
out in sympathy with their fellows at Needles,
who have an alleged grievance. At a point like
Needles, overtime is a considerable factor In
the computation of Â¦ wages. The business of the
company necessarily calls for a great deal of
overtime, and as is the custom of the Santa Fe
system, time and a half, which is fifty-six cents
an hour, Is paid there for overtime.
In reference to the claim of the committee
that the men at Needles simply asked to be
placed on the same basis as the men employed
at Tucson and El Paso, I only can say that
this is not in accordance with the facts. The
men at Needles asked for forty cents an hour
and time and a half for overtime, finally re
questing as a compromise, which the company
refused to accept, forty cents an hour and time
and a quarter for overtime, which is the maxi
mum rate at Tucson and El Paso, and not the
average. The Southern Pacific Company, at
the last named points, has a graduated scale
of wages, the maximum being forty cents an
hour and the minimum thirty-two cents.
General Manager A. G. Wells of the
Santa Fe system gave out the following
statement to-nieht:
The committee appointed to meet General
Manager A. G. Wells has exhausted every
means of reaching an amicable adjustment of
the difficulties between : the company and the
striking employes without success.
The men at Needles simply asked to be placed
on the same basis as 'those similarly engaged
at Tucson and El Paao. This the company re
fused to accede to, although given thirty-three
days to Consider the demands. â¢â¢ The San Ber
nardino employes went out because the rule of
seniority was violated and one of the old em
ployes was ordered to go to a station in Arizo
na. The company agreed to rescind the order
of "transfer and pay the men 40 cents an hour
and time and a quarter for overtime. These,
men refused to return until the demands of the
Needles strikers should be granted.
The committee has waited . five days in Los
Angeles for a decision from the company. To
day we were given- the following official de
cision:
"If all the striking employes -will report for
duty at noon Monday next the company will
take back such of them as it sees fit on terms
heretofore stipulated."
We did not attemDt to discuss the matter
further, but referred the whole subject to John
McNeil, grand president, and we expect him to
take steps that may result in a walkout of
all the boiler-makers on the Santa Fe system.
The question has already been passed upon by
the executive committee of the brotherhood,
and only tho report of our committee Is needed
to bring the whole subject to an issue.
The committee desires to thank General Man
ager A. G.- Wells for his uniformly courteous
treatment, and we believe that had the matter
been left to his discretion he would have met
the strikers' Just demands.
Chairman W. J. Ritchie of the com
mittee," who is foreman of the San Ber
nardino shops, gave the following official
statement of the strikers' position:
LOS ANGELES, June 2Lâ The confer
ence between a committee of striking
boiler-makers of San Bernardino and the
Needles, California, and A., G. Wells,
general manager of the Pacific system of
the Santa Fe, ended to-day in a disagree
ment. The committeemen . left for their
homes to-night, having. referred the ques
tion of a strike of boiler-makers on the
entire system to John McNeil, grand
president of the International Brother

ROYERSFORD, Pa., April 19th,
1902. Dr. Kilmer, & Co., Bing-
hamton, N. Y. -: â¢' '
Gentlemen: â I had been a sufferer
from kidney trouble for about 8 years
with pain in side, back and head. About
6 or. 8 months ago I concluded to try
a bottle of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root.
To my surprise I experienced a decided
relief before I had taken half of the bot-
tle, and one morning passed a gravel
stone as large as a pea, which I still
have in my possession and will be
pleased to show to any one who doubts
the efficacy of this wonderful remedy.
One month ago, finding some of the
old .symptoms returning, I purchased a
50c bottle of Swamp-Root at Dr.
Morey's Drug Store, and before I had
taken one^fourth of it I found in the
vessel which I had voided during the
night a teaspoonful of small gravel
stones and sand, the passing of which
was" immediately followed by relief.

I am well acquainted with Mr. But-

Cherry Tree Worth Having.
SAN JOSE, June 21.â D. C. Vestal, a
pioneer orchardist of this county, has just
received $199 for the fruit from one cherry
tree on his place on the Berryessa Road,
northeast of this city. Tho tree is of the
black Tartarian variety and Is very large
and old. There were 1990 pounds of cher
ries on the tree, which were sold In the
Eastern market for 10 cents a pound. An
acre of such trees would have netted the
owner more than $20,000. This is believed
to have been the largest crop ever taken
from a single tree In the State. From
another tree of the black Bigarreau va
riety in the same orchard 1200 pounds wu
taken.
Many years ago the Northern California
Indians had a rendezvous in San Rafael
each year, when they would feast for
many days on the clams and other shell
fish at that time so abundant on the
bay shore.
Ed Wright, who uncovered the bones,
was digging in the mound and carting
off the shell earth I -> make a tennis court
foundation. He ea.iiumed the bones In the
morning and this afternoon came across
a large flintstone battle axe eight inches
wide and in an excellent state of preser
vation. The entire mound will be torn
up and it is expected that many valuable
relics will be unearthed.
SAN RAFAEL. June 21.â Three skele
tons were unearthed in the heart of San
Rafael to-day. The bones ' were discov
ered while workmen were excavating in
a vacant let at the corner of Irwin street
and Hotel Rafael boulevard. They were
in what has been known for many years
as an Indian mound. The mound, which
is ten feet high and many feet in cir
cumference, is composed of decomposed
clam shells and ashes and the skeletons
were found about four feet from the top.
Two of the" skulls were small, like those
of children, while one was very large and
thick. The latter was intact and a good
specimen.

Hadley had been working in a Los An
geles drygoods store, but was discharged.
He went to another store, and, being re
fused employment, broke a number of
articles, but before the police arrived he
had disappeared. He was walking along
the road near Downey to escape arrest
when the tramps assaulted him.
Hadley's wounds are such that the
physicians hold cut but slight hope of his
recovery. The most serious wound is in
the abdomen. An operation was perform
td to-night, but the result of it will not be
known until to-morrow.
Hadley said he was walking along a road
when he was approached by two men,
supposedly tramps. They demanded
money, but when he told them that he
had no money they said that his clothing
would do and ordered that he disrobe. He
refused and they attacked him. One of
them knocked him down and the other
attacked him with a knife, repeatedly
stÂ«.bbing him. He knew no more until he
iwoke in the hospital.

ACCUSES TRAMPS
OF THE ASSAULT
Senator Hanna announced to-day that
he would follow Senator Platt's lead in
this matter and fight out the question in
any form Senator Platt saw fit.
Senator Platt of Connecticut, one of the
central figures in the attempted Cuban
legislation and one of the four leading
Senators who has not been charged with
insincerity, is very anxious that some
tariff concessions be made for Cuba at
tho earliest possible moment, but he is
not ready to insist that the conference
shall report the Cuban bill to the Senate
and insist on a vote.
PLATT IS ANXIOUS.
Whatever has been done so far in the
matter of negotiations is altogether pre
liminary and only with a view of ratifica
tion in December, when Congress meets
again. The President wants action on
the Cuban tariff bill, and that is what he
is thinking about now because he never
knows when he is beaten.
Senators Frye and Hale of Maine and
Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island, import
ant leaders at all times in the session and
particularly so during the last days, are
all opposed to having the treaty precipi
tated on Congress at this time. -They
think that It. would not only cause a bit-,
ter fight and increase factional difficulties
within the party, but with the present
attitude of the Democrats, who desire
Congress to adjourn without granting
any concessions to Cuba, such a treaty
might fail. .
Senator Foraker, who had a talk with
the President to-day over the Cuban situ
ation, said later at the. capital that there
was no probability of the treaty being
sent in before adjournment.
WHAT ROOSEVELT WANTS.
Senator Lodge said to-day that it was
not at all likely that the treaty would
be sent to the Senate during the closing
hours of the present session. It would
first be necessary to complete negotia
tions by the transmission of the treaty
to the- Cuban Government at Havana, as
there is no disposition on the part of the
Cuban authorities to trust this ; matter
entirely in the hands of Minister Quesada,
who, it is now said, is not in- complete
favor with the leaders of the Cuban Con
gress and would, have failed of confirma
tion had his not been the first appoint
ment made by President Palma. He dis
tinctly stated to callers to-day that there
was not time enough to negotiate the
treaty and sen* it to the Senate before
adjournment. He f irther said that he did
not desire to send in the treaty for rati
fication while the Senate showed such de
cided disinclination to go on record on
any kind of reciprocity with Cuba.
NO TREATY THIS SESSION.
The announcement by the President's
friends that the fight has just begun
means that an effort will -be made to
solidify public sentiment during the cam
paign in order that there may be no
doubt of the ratification of such a treaty;
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N
W.. WASHINGTON, June 21.â Unless
President Roosevelt makes a complete
change in his plan, no reciprocity treaty
with Cuba will be sent to the Senate dur
ing the present session, and there will be
no extra session called after the adjourn
ment, the first, week in July. The Presi
dent is not now negotiating a treaty with
Cuba. Reciprocity by legislation was no
sooner declared to be dead by the leaders
and admitted by. the administration than
reciprocity* by treaty began to be consid
ered. So far as perfected the present
plans for this only contemplate the nego
tiation of a treaty with Cuba during the
long recess and its submission to the Sen
ate for ratification at the beginning of
the short session in December.

JEFFERSON, Iowa, June 2Lâ One of the

early to-day, resulting from an attempt
to arrest Horace Shipman on a peace
warrant.
For a breach of the . peace last night
a warrant was sworn | out for Shipman
and placed In the hands of Marshal John
Swearlngen for service. Dr. C. H. Grim
mell, Shipman;s family physician, went
ahead of the marshal to attempt to have
Shipman surrender peaceably. - Shipman
agreed to do this, but when Swearingen
and Deputy Sheriff Fred .Kendall appeared
at the door he warned them, not to come
In under penalty of death.
, Swearlngen, undaunted, started to pull
his revolver, and Shipman fired a load of
shot, striking the marshal in the lower
part of the face and killing him. instant

retreat, leaving the body of the marshal
upon the porch. ,*^f(S

The boiler-makers were also notified to
day that they will have until Monday
morning to return to work. Those who
refuse will, it is stated, be barred penna
rently from further employment by the
road. It is believed by some that this acÂ»
ticn on the part of the railroad will pre
cipitate a strike among the machinists.
ST. PAUL. Minn., June 21.â The strike
of the Great Northern boiler-makers and
helpers has been turned into a lockout.
An official of the company said to-day the
company had all the men It needed, that
work was going on satisfactorily and that
a. few of the strikers were again at work.
The conferences held between the strikers
find Superintendent Duvrelle are said to
be at an end. The proposition submitted
by the company has been refused.
An official of the road this afternoon
stated that this action on the part of the
road was necessary, as the strike of the
bcller-makers had crippled the other
Â¦work, and it was impossible to keep other
men as long as the strike continued. He
also says that the company is iri good
condition for engines and that few are
awaiting repairs.
OMAHA. Nebr., June 2Lâ R. E. McLean,
general organizer of the American Federa
tion of Labor, arrived in the city to-day
to assist in the settlement of the strike
of the Union Pacific boiler-makers. A
meeting of all the unions will be held to
morrow, when some plan for a settlement
will probably be agreed to.
The Union Pacific Railroad this after
noon posted a notice in its shops notify
ing 250 men of their release from employ
ment for the present on account of the
Etrike of the boiler-makers. The men
were also notified that any who were ag
grieved at the action taken by the road
and refused to report for duty Monday
morning would be discharged and not re
instated under any circumstances.

This seems.to be a good year for calamities. We are getting them , of all sorts and sizes
from Volcanoes .to ] grasshoppers. . Kansas, as usual, has a novelty. Some of the counties in that
State have been invaded by <ants of unusually large size and in immense' numbers* It is said they
(devour whole fields of alfalfa^ attack animals and" even invade the homes of : . the people making
life miserable for everybody. â¢' , . Â¦
. If ;we^id not know itfromthe almanac; the approach of W silly season would be revealed
to us by the fact that the Eastern paners are discussing whether pie or icecream is the greater
benefit to American life, ..#. : . " v ..- â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦ : .-,-~ -,>Â¦â¢
Doubtless that view of the situation is fairly correct. There have been sufficiently authori
tative reports of disagreements between the King and the Prime Minister- to justify a belief that
the King would be glad to make a change. A dissolution of Parliament would, of course, please
every' man in the kingdom who is discontented with -the Salisbury, administration, and that'^rob
ably means a large majority of the voters. The promise of a "new deal" is always attractive to
outsiders. In Grear Britain as in this country there is never, lacking a desire for another election
and. a'chance to try again. Consequently if the King should insist upon ciissoiution the effect
might easily be an- immense increase in his personal prestige and authority.
In times past the beginning of a new reign has been invariably attended by the calling of
a new Parliament, but a law enacted; under the leadership of Gladstone renders it no longer imper
ative that a Parliament dissolve with the death of the sovereign who called it. Still, the & King can
summon a new one if , he choose. That is his prerogative. If Edward were ambitious the oppor
tunity would be tempting; but he is not ambitious. It is safe to ; say h'e will leave Salisbury un
disturbed to look after Parliament, and will not undertake to imitate the 'action of Kaiser Wil
helm in dismissing Bismarck. He will recall thesaying 'of Disraeli: "There is often more wisdom *
displayed in foregoing an advantage than in seizing an opportunity," and he will take no risks by
interfering in politics despite inducements which seem so tempting to trie gentlemen' of the clubs.
ACCORDING. to what is said to be the prevailing opinion in the political clubs in Lon
don King Edward has a glorious opportunity offered in the present condition of British
politics to make himself a real King, and rule as well as reign. The situation is this:
o The people are weary of the Ministry, and the King is with the people. He desires a
dissolution of the present Parliament and. the election of a new one immediately after the corona
1 tion. The people agree with him. Salisbury refuses to dissolve Parliament, but the King can dis
solve it by royal act if he chooses to^exercise the power. It is asserted that should the King dis
miss his Ministry, and call for the election of a new Parliament, the act would beone of great pop
ularity and. largely strengthen his hold upon the people. -. Â¦â¢/.. /

Fortunate Is the man 'who can depend
upon himself at all times.
Andâ for this was'after the playâ I was
permitted a glimpse of an ice cream and
glory affair; a pinky, silken, rose-gar
landed, ermine-lined wrap, and much oth
er gorgeousness that feminine San Fran
cisco is going to lose its heart to before
long.
"And what of the classic black of the
gambling scene?" I asked, missing it.
"Like Bernhardt, we don't wear black/'
smiled Mjss Anglin, caressing a pearl
embroidered white robe.- 'â¢This, â¢ Instead
What else there will be to remind . of
Bernhardt I don't know. And, frankly "
she whispered, "I'm a little fearful of
comparisons.''
"Really, 1 am too much In the Fullgar
ney key to think or talk about her," Miss
Anglin declared. "My Camille is too neb
ulous, too much in the air, not sufficient
ly defined,. to discuss â only as to cloches.
I don't care much for chiffons after all,
but 'I really have some good Camille
gowns."
"Not of your part," I protested. "He
told me. of the new key in which he de
signed to pitch the play. The Camille
stratum of society in Paris Is one of the
highest external refinement, as far as one
may pretend to knowledge of Its condi
tionsâMr.. Miller put It, a society in which
wit,. brains and beauty are the Inevitable
price of admission, and. that in conse
quence possesses these in. lavish degree.
Just^as in old Greece- and Japan to-day.
'Consider . the impossible farce-comedy
Prudence amid such entourage,' Mr. Mil
ler said. 'Beginning with Prudence,
everything possible in the way of refining
the atmosphere of the play is to be done.'
But to Camille."
the play over here after Its 400 nights
In London."
"And next week Is the first performance
by the great American originals?" I
queried.
"That sounds like a variety show," re
proved Miss Anglin. "But yes, this Is Its
first time. I hope it goes well. That Is a
wonderful scene in the third actâ Pinero
is a great third 'acter"â between Lord
Quex and Sophy.
" 'Unlock the door, my lord! Let me out,
my lord! ? â¢ â¢ No, I won't! Why, it's
like selling Muriel. Just to get myself
out of this, I'm simply handing her over
to you! I won't do it! I won't!' "âand
Miss Anglin's face, responsive as a wind
flower, fell into lines of wild fear and an
ger. Then, lapsing into her Trelawny
self, she added, "That is where the Full
garney cockney comes out."
"And what a clever foil she is to Quex,
the polished man about town, who
achieves reform after dedicating the most
of his 48 years to being a horrible ex
ample!" I said.
"Yes, I think those who are dissatisfied
with Mr. Miller's small part in 'Trelaw
ny' will rejoice In his Quex," Miss An
glin said. "And, frankly, 1 think that
Mr. Millerâ I suppose It Is not; good form
to say it, but you needn't report me â will
look and play the part much better than
Mr. Hare."
"You saw the Hare-Vanbrugh edition?"
"Yes; I went, as other people go, for
once to enjoy, not to study."
"And now, Miss Anglin, about the sur
prise of this engagementâ I know all
about it, Mr. Miller told meâ mayn't I
hear something of your Camille?"
"If Mr. Miller has told you all about
It " Miss Anglin laughed.
Not that this was at all the kind of
work for which : Mr. Rosner was origin
ally destined by his forbears. At 13 years
of age, as a wonder child, he was playing
most of the gTeat piano concertos in the
pianist's repertoire. He received his edu
cation in Leipsic, Leaving Buda-Pesth
with the intention of studying: with Mos
cheles, then, with the Leipsic Conserva
tory. But his intention, 'and possibly
other complications, had a fatal effect,
for Moscheles died immediately on: young
Rosner's arrival. But Tausig, one of th*
greatest technicians of that or any time,
was Appointed in Moscheles* place, and
for four years the lad studied with him.
The pianist's seemed then the certain ca
reer open to the little Rosner, and for
some time .he .followed the life. Then
came a perio'd as a soldier with the Aus
trian Hussars, and afterward he drifted
into the leadership of the Vienna Or
pheum, ending -his -European career as
leader of the Orpheum- at Buda-Pesth.
San Francisco now enters upon rhe stage.
There are many wonderful things to be
seen and heard at our Orpheum, but I
doubt me much' if there is anything on
the programmes more remarkable than
the everyday stunt that the Rosner or
chestra puts up. It, is perhaps hardly re
markable as music, but as musical blufl
it is of the magnificent sort, and clever
to a degree. There are grand coups made
retreats covered, chasms bridged all un
der the dear, stupid nose of the audience
without , its . ever having a hint of the
matter. Feats of musical acrobatlsm are
demanded from the little orchestra at
which a more classic band [ would turn
pale and fly. Imagine a Thomas orches
tra under these conditions. A performer
of the never-had-a-lesson-in-hls-llf e class
comes along with a repertoire of three
songs but without any music - =
"Oh, vamp something in the kev O f C "
he cheerfully directs Mr. Rosner And
by ear/ not only the conductor, but the
whole orchestra, proceeds to "vamD in
the^key of C," harmonizing the melody
as they go along. One rehearsal on Sun
aay morning suffices for this extraor
dinary feat. Of course, a Berlioz orches
tration Is hardly the' result of *heir ef
forts, but I have laughed and wondered
THIS Is the obverse side oÂ£ E. M.
Rosner, conductor of the Orpheum,
whose back view is probably more
familiar to the San Francisco pub
lic than anything after Lotta]3
fountain. This coming week Mr. Rosner
celebrates his fifteenth anniversary at
thÂ« Orpheum, that is also coincident
v/ith the opening of the O'Farrell-street
temple of variety.' Fifteen years ago on
the 30th of June the Orpheum opened
under the direction of Gustav Walter,
new passed "over. Fifteen years ago on
the 3f>th of- June Mr. Rosner began his
engagement, then on the other side of
the footlights, as conductor of a band
from Budiy-Pesth. The band played on
for sixteen' weeks, then left for Los An
geles and the south, returning afterward
to play another ten weeks for Mr. Wal
ter. Then came the time to return to
Buda-Pesth to fulfill other engagements,
but the Orpheum manager wisely seized
his opportunity and persuaded Rosner
and some of his men to remain. Since
that time the present leader has* been
connected with the fortunes of the 7 house,
not always good, for the local vaudeville
factory was not always the flourishing
institution it now is, and with Mr. Ros
ner are men who have been associated
with him for fifteen, sixteen and up to
twenty-eight years, for, before his Or
pheum advent the conductor directed the
Orpheum3 of both Vienna and Buda-
Pesth.
ONE OF THE CLEVEREST
ACTRESSES ON THE AMERI
CAN STAGE.
There is, of course, the other side of
the work, the accompaniment of the Ju
lia Heinrichs, Jessie Bartlett Davises and
other entertainment of like high class
that Orpheum enterprise has so com
mendably furnished its patrons.
Here is where Mr. Rosner is In hU
glory. There is much Worthy work also
in the way of purely orchestral numbers.
Mr. Rosner is very happy in his work In
spite of its little drawbacks, and would
probably be too happy altogether if the
amateur contingent would only refrain
from "The. Holy City"â for which Mr.
Rosner shares my limited admirationâ
and "Asleep in the Deep," in whLch most
barytones and bassos seem to wish to get
their voices dead and buried.
There is another sort of crank that is a.
rather sore subject with the Orpheum
conductorâ a singer of the olTensively
modest type that demands ins voice
drowned by the cornet, trombone and
drums, at their fortissimostâ the audience
naturally but unjustly condemning the
conductor for the blatant racket. All of
this outside of the legitimate ana peculiar
difficulties of his work, the task of bang
ing the drum just as the tall and lean
gentleman plants his fist In tho pneu
matic stomach of hia short and fat asso
ciate, and the like.
many times at the clever semi-Wagnerian
harmonies that decorate "Flatfoot Sal."
or the ingenious curlycueing of the flute
around some coon melody, or the serena
sustaining of the trombone end of things
in these improvisations.
Nor is this all. It frequently happens
that a singer will sag in pitch, and at a
look and a word from the conductor
dow.n goes the orchestra a half-tone â or
it may be up a half-toneâ transposing to
the end of the song into the tew key.
Occasionally the vocalist will come on
pointing to a sore throat and a3king a
lowered pitch. Again, on the instant,
the orchestra transposes into the desired
key. The matter of rhythm is also a pe
culiar one with the usual Orpheum vocal
ist. Not once in twenty times will ho
rehearse the song: in the tempo in which
he takes it during the performance, and.
again, his illiteracy will telescope threÂ«
measures into one or spread one over
tivtnty, with the most cheerful reliance
on Mr. Rosner's ability to pull him
through.
"Next week's Is not exactly a 'chiffon*
play for you. is it?" I asked when 1 she
returned, not because I did not remember
that Miss Anglin's role of the fair mani
curist in "The Gay Lord Quex" did not
cemar.d chiffons, but to resume.
"'Valma, I've made ut> my mind. I in
tend to do exactly what you wish in the
future in everything. r m going to give
up squatting down here manicuring gen
tlemen-and shall simply sail about these
rooms, overlooking my girls in the plain

manner. "The plainest of silks "
"Bravo!" I cried. "Very foreign terri

yourself, must count here as elsewhere
more heavily than any theorizing," Miss

"You don't like the venerable garb of
your grandmother."
"Exactly," she laughed. "And I have
the doubtful credit among many peoplo
Â©1 never studying. But of that I know
Tth&t I know." And Miss Anglin looked
as If che could tell much an* she had a
mind.
"No, I have no theories about my work.
Sometimes I hardly know Just what I
shall do when I go on the stage," Miss
Anglin continued. "It comes to me likeâ
O well!â Just as It comes to one to eat
one's breakfast. It Is about as necessary
&nd natural to me to do one thing as the
other. I don't know Quite why, or how."

It was at the Wednesday matinee and she
stood In the wings, making a little moue
of disgust at the three-decker hoop skirt
that Rose Trelawney of the "Wells" must
wear. But a pretty woman is pretty in
anything, and Miss Anglin Is much bet
ter than pretty. Even the squat lines of
a "pork pie" hat added only charm to her
significant face, with its pure oval, deli
cately arched nose, sensitive lips and
clear, laughing eyes. Nor could the mon
umental Iniquity of the eternal feminine's
garb of the early sixties entirely disguise
her characteristic grace of figure.
YOU might as well try to pin down
a butterfly to theorizing about

Miss Margaret Anglin to theorize
about acting. I know lor I have
tried it. Not once but three times this
season I have invited her to hurl artistic
dogmas at my head, but without success,
as she has none to hurl. Miss Anglin, to
whom possibly belongs more surely than
to any other actress on the American
stage â barring Mrs. Fiske â the gift of
genius, acts as a bird sings, because she

CLEVER MUSICIAN WHO HAS DI
RECTED THE ORCHESTRA AT
THE ORPHEUM FOR 15 YEARS.
It is stated that he has acted as a private citizen and as such has a right to the sentimental
preferences of an unofficial person. No one denies the right of private citizens to be sentimental.
But Gage charges that he has been libeled with reference to his official acts. He is related to San
Quentin prison only as Governor of California. He asserts that he desires vindication as Gov
ernor. , Then why not a trial in Sacramento?
The plea of a sentimental preference for San Pedro has all the seeming of sheer hypocrisy.
No man can rightly estimate the motives of another, and The Call does not pretend to under
stand the curious inner workings of a nature like that of Henry T. Gage, but judging from the
facts in the case the flight tc^San Pedro was taken solely that a bluff might be made of an intent
to bring the issue to trial, while making sure of a postponement of the hearing until after the Re
publican State Convention. The defendants will not consent to such a postponement if they can
prevent it. They ask a prompt hearing. They demand a right to submit all the evidence in
the case. They repeat that they will justify and sustainevery statement made in The Call con
cerning the San Quentin frauds. Let Governor Gage meet the issue if. he dare.
He has said that his character has been libeled, his reputation assailed, his honor im
pugned, his official integrity maligned. He has said that he wishes vindication, redress and venge
ance. He has declared an intention to reveal, expose and explode a wicked conspiracy to ruin
him by the publication' of libelous falsehoods. Then why' does he run off to an obscure, out of the
way place, and bring suit where a speedy trial is almost an impossibility?
As Governor of the State his official residence is at Sacramento. Why does he not bring
the suit there? â¢ .
In the hearing before Judge Fritz on Friday Governor Gage was represented by one of the
ablest lawyers in the State. .-He will doubtless have other, able lawyers to assist the first who has
appeared.. His interests and his honor will be carefully looked after. Why, then, does he object to
a speedy trial?
The Prison Directors are going to hold an inquiry of their own. Will they not insist on v
keeping the books and documents in their hands until their inquiry is over? Would. the hearing
at San Pedro have to wait until the Directors' investigation closed? If so, how long would
the wait be? ' - ... Â¦' â¢â¢Â¦
An important part of the evidence in the case are documents and books of San Quentin
prison. Can they be carried promptly to San Pedro? Will there be no objection on the part of
the Governor, the Warden, or the Prison Directors to the removal of the prison records to that
distant point in the State? "
What- are the prospects of a trial 'at San Pedro, where Gage has brought his suit "for
strictly sentimental considerations"?
There are twelve Judges in this county. If Gage be not willing. to trust his case before any
one of them, then there are Judges in ' Sacramento, where the Governor resides and where the
prison reports are^on file; there are Judges in Marin County, where the prison is located, and
where the testimony of documents and of witnesses alike can be readily had. If the Governor ob
ject to all those, then why not bring the suit to trial in Alameda, in Santa Clara, or some other
central locality. ') Â¦
The defendants have no objection to any court in California; They ask only that suit be
tried in a locality where the witnesses and the documentary evidence can be brought forward with
out delay, Â£nd before a tribunal ithat will admit all the evidence in the case. \
If Gage will consent to a trial in San Francisco, Sacramento, Marin, Alameda, Santa Clara,
San Mateo, or any other county where a prompt trial can be had, where all pertinent testimony
will be admitted, he can select the county and he can pick out his Judge. The defendants ask
nothing but a prompt trial and a full hearing. '
Just why Gage should deem it likely, that he will get favors shown him at San Pedro, we
do not know. : A T either does the public know why, he should object to a trial before a court sitting
in a locality where the evidence in the case could be readily 'produced. I
Action brought in that way is not so much a blow as a dodge. The Governor has put him
self in a position where he can fight for delay, and interpose objections to evidence. In fact, by
various tricks "and devices, he can prevent a full trial of thecase until after the adjournment of the
Republican State Convention, before which body he is to go as a candidate for renomination.
By way of explaining why he shirks a trial in a locality where the evidence can be easily
and promptly presented, the Governor, says that he is moved by sentimental considerations. He
began his career in San Pedro. He has dearly beloved friends in San Pedro. . Therefore it is to San
Pedro he goes for redress and vindication.
â¢ Having thus posed himself in the attitude of a hero, about to. .fight three foes at once, the
Governor paused for applause. The applause did not come. The people waited to see the fight
begin. The pose was. too strained to be satisfactory, and as the public began, to ask why he did
not "do something," the Governor at last decided to take action. Flying to a remote part of the
State, far away from the scene of the offenses; theciornicile of the defendants and the homes of the
> witnesses, the Governor brought suit for criminal liber against the proprietor and the manager
of The Call. v v . .: : ., ; ' V
GOVERNOR GAGE, after declaring in an official interview that the exposures made
by The Call. of frauds committed. in the administration of San' Quentin State Prison
did not affect him^. suddenly changed ; his mind arid began to "assert; vehemently that
the exposure was a, part of a conspiracy among the proprietors of The Call, the
Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times to ruin him. He vowed vengeance. ;He announced that
he would sue the proprietor of The Call for "criminal libel, the proprietor , of the -Times for.dam
ages in a civil suit, and would deal with the proprietor of the; Chronicle when that gentleman re
turns from Europe. Â¦ â¢ ;

The question of meeting place for the
next annual conference of the league was
quickly, settled by accepting the invita
tion of .Trinity Church, Los Angeles,'
which promised a hearty welcome and en

'" The committee's recommendation that
the conference accept an Invitation from
the anti-Saloon League to" send a del
egate to its next convention at Washing
ton was adopted, and Dr. M. B. Chapman
cf Los Angeles was elected delegate, with
Rev. W. E. Vaughn as alternate.
Horace N. Caldwell of Lompoc was
unanimously re-elected president of the
State league, there being no other nom
inations. Th ' vote for first vice pres
ident resulted in* the election of Rev
Hampton Matthews of Hanleyville. Miss
Grace Castle of San Francisco was elect
ed second vice president and Noel H

Both are the incumbents. W. F

re-elected secretary-treasurer. Mrs. M
V. Healey of Alameda was re-elected
State junior superintendent.
An amendment to the State constitution
providing that the State secretary-treas
urer should collect duty and from the dis
trict organizations instead of the local
chapters was adopted. Another amend
ment providing that th'e district officers
should collect all reports and forward
them to the State secretary was* favor
ably acted upon. The object .of Â¦ these
changes is to simplify the work of the
State officials. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦
At 10:45 o'clock the party returned to
the church in good time for the morning
sermon, preached by Rev. J. D. Frazer
of Downey. President N. Caldwell sub
mitted his annual report in writing. He
noted the need of a reduction of the State
and district organizations to a more har
monious plan of action. The general
state of the league was reported to be
healthy. The editor of the Pacific Meth
odist Advocate was thanked for his court
esy in extending to the league the free
use of his paper's columns and the fail
ure of the leaguers to take advantage
of it was deplored. President Caldwell
also thanked his brother. State officers for
the united support of his administration.

A Move That American Manufactur

Follow.
The managers of American railways
might, to their own.: great advantage as
well as to that of their patrons, take a
leaf out of the book of the Government
railway control of Prussia. These officials
have ordered that experiments should be
made looking toward the substitution
upon the 30,000. miles of Irailroads which
they operate of non-combustible cars for
;the more or less Inflammable -boxes in
which the public f are now transported
from place to place. The steel trucks are,
of course, already comparatively safe
from destruction by flre, but the construc
tion, of the superstructure of these coaches
has always been of such a nature as to
be something of a menace to the travel
er's safety.
The walls and floors and general trim
of passenger cars have ordinarily been
constructed' of woods that are peculiarly
inflammable, and the use of oils in their
cleansing and decoration has intensified
the danger. The Prussian experiments,
in recognition of these facts, are to be In
the direction of having floors and walls
of materials chemically treated so as to
make them, non-combustible, and of the
construction of seats , stuff ed with fire
proof cocoanut fiber and having asbestos
coverings.
It is an important step and In the right
direction; and in a country like our own,
where there is so much more travel and a
correspondingly greater duty for conserv
ing the security of the traveling public
over more than 180,000 miles of roadbed,
It would seem as if it would be a wise
precedent for the railway authorities to
follow. As a rule, our railways are ex
ceptionally well managed, and the trav
eler ' in the United States gets a vast
amount of comfort and convenience at a
very slight personal risk, but the further
step toward the making of fireproof
coaches would' serve to greatly reduce
that risk to a minimum which >would
amount almost to Its total extinction.â

SomÂ« Instances of Maltreatment of
Words of the. English
Language.
A correspondent points out that our
pronunciation (which is too often "pro
nounciation") has its faults. It Is only
too true, and "Glberaltar" is a rock on
which many split "Heighth" is a com
mon mistake, and a few months ago thou
sands of people were convinced that they
were in "February." Not one man in a
hundred calls an ishmus anything but
an "ismus." And "aerated"! The mal
treatment of that word demands a sep
arate hospital. "Areated" Is the common
injury. But there have been heard such
compound - fractures as "aereated and
"aeriorated." After that "diptheria,
which merely loses an "h," is a mild case.
Foreigners, however, may be excused,
since their mistakes are usually due to a
superfluity of conscience. One may sym
pathize with a Frenchman who puts faith
in any rule as to the pronunciation. Oi.
"ough:" The plural of "potato'* may
have no terrors for him, but set him to
pronounce this sentence, invented by
Punch: "A rough-coated, dough-face.1
plowman strode, coughing and hiccough-
Ing, thoughtfully through the streets pf
Scarborough." The foreigner who could
take that fence would deserve Immediate
nationalization as he alighted.
In -regard to the popular pronunciation
of "Berkshire," "Derby" and "clerk," a
correspondent reminds us that the late
Professor Freeman discussed the question
some twenty years ago In the Nineteenth
Century. Professor Freeman's view was
that it did not matter whether we say
"Barkshire" or "Burkshire," since both
are equally wrong. He supposed that the
original and proper sound of the first syl
lable was the same as that heard In
"berry" or "Berwick," when they are not
pronounced as they are In many provin
cial districts, "burry" and "Burrlck." If
you take a Scotsman unawares he will in
variably revert to the original and proper
"Bairkshire" and "clairk." â London

to send a committee to the mill owners
on Monday, to ask them to submit the
differences which exist between the own
ers and dyers' helpers to arbitration. The
city officials decided to-night to post mil
itia at the mills and keep them there un
til the whole trouble Is over.
PATERSON, N. J., June 2Lâ A meeting
of all the trades ! unions connected with
the silk industry In this place was held
late to-day. It was decided not to go to
work again in the mills until the military
had been withdrawn from the city. No
formal strike was declared, but the mat

The first formal meeting: ot the Isthmian
canal conference will bo at 2 o'clock on
Monday. This was arranged at the' meet
ing of Morgan and Hepfcura. The meet
ing was devoted to a careful study of
the Panama amendment with, a view to
getting a thorough understanding of all
its bearings. It was stated afterward
that no conclusions, beyond thÂ» fact that
a meeting of the conference shoulS b*
held Monday, had been reached..
There is no doubt this Is the position of
two out of three House conferees and it is
thought to be shared by all of them.
This Insures an agreement in conference
without much delay even if the House
does not relieve the conferees of their
responsibilities by adopting a motion to
concur With the Senate, which there is
good reason to believe Burton of Ohio is
ready to make.
Although no formal meeting of tha
House conferees was held, informal ex
changes showed their general attitude
They are first of all for a canal ad whila
favorable to the Nicaragua route, they
will nqt insist upon that route to the
extent of defeating all legislation. As
soon as it becomes evident that the Sen
ate will not yield the Spooner amendment
will be accepted as the best solution pos
sible.

Grcsvenor's motion, after some debate,
Â¦was voted down without division and was
gent back to conference.
Grosvenor of Ohio moved that the
House concur in the Senate amendment
for a memorial bridge across the Potomac,
to cost not to exceed $2,500,000, and appro
priating $100,000 for the preparation of
plans. Twenty minutes* debate was al

his motion, referred to ('the fact that the

Cannon of Illinois called up the confer
ence report on the sundry civil bill. Can

only partial. Of the $6,457,000 added to the
bill by the Senate, $4,053,000 had been
fegieca to by the conferees, leaving items
carrying $1,283,000 still in controversy. The
report was agreed to without division.
Hull and Parker of New Jersey defend
ed the conference report, arguing that the
lucrease was necessary in order to prop
eriy officer the army. The report was
adoptedâ 68 to 59.
Clayton called attention to the fact that
the army, which cost annually $25,000,000

on the military academy appropriation
bill. Hay of Virginia., Clayton of Ala
bama and Mann of Illinois criticized the
tciion of the House conferees in agreeing
to the number of cadets at West Point
proposed by the Senate. Mann said that
recently the number of cadets had been
increa.Â£ed 100. The increased membership
of the House will further increase the
cadets thirty, and now it is proposed to
increase that number still further. He
did not believe we should legislate in the
direction of a gTeat increase of the stand

at Koeniggratz. On the betrothal of his
daughter Herr Duchatschek had v an

bride was formally weighed "in the draw

The lady turning the scales at sixty-two
kilograms, a sack was* at once filled, with
silver crowns to the same weight, with
half a kilogram overâ for the weight of
the bag, as Herr Duchatschek _ playfully
explained. The exact number of crowns

McMaster, for the prosecution, moved
that judgment be rendered on the motions
made by the prosecution to set aside the
writs of habeas corpus. Teschereau,
cdunsel for the prisoners, objected to the
motions. Judge Andrews said that since
receiving the notices last evening he had
given the latter his greatest attention and
as the case was in his hands, he would
now render judgment on the motions to
quash the habeas corpus writs. The judg
ment was a very elaborate one.
â¢ Judge Andrews discharged the motion
for contempt against Detective Carpen
ter. In rendering judgment in this case,
the Judge remarked that the x proceedings
connected with the arrest of the accused
deserved certain censure. Judge Andrews
then stated that he had received a dec
laration from the attorneys of Gaynor and
Green, whereby they withdrew their dec
larations and informed counsel that he
was ready to hear them.
The attorneys for the United States
scored a temporary success to-day when
Judge -Andrews handed down a decision
rejecting petitions for writs of certiorari,
quashing the writs of habeas corpus and
ordering Sheriff Langelier to take Green

extradition proceedings were to be re
sumed.

THEM IS JAIL
! In general terms it may be said that
Alaska, for which the United States paid
Russia $7,200,000 in 1867, has supplied furs,
fish and gold amounting to about $150,000,
000 in value, about equally divided be
tween these three items; that the invest
ments of capital from the United States
in Alaska are probably $25,000,000, with a
large additional sum Invested in transpor
tation to that Territory, and that the an
nual shipments of merchandise to Alaska
now aggregate more than $12,000,000, and
have aggregated since the purchase near
ly or quite $100,000,000. Meantime the pop
ulation has grown from an estimated
30,000 at the date of purchase to 32,052 in
1S90, 63,592 in 1900 and an estimated 75,000
at the present time.
The number of fur seals taken on the
Pribilof Islands from 1870 to 1901 is 2,187,
317, and the value of the seal and other
furs taken since the purchase of Alaska
by the. United States is estimated at about
$30,000,000. The fur seal industry, which
has declined in the last few years, was
succeeded by the fishing industry, Alaska
now supplying about one-half of the sal
mon of the country.' The value of the
salmon pack In Alaska last year is esti
mated at , about $7,000,000, and the total
value of the fish taken in Alaska since
the purchase about $50,000,000, while the
value of gold and silver mined since the
purchase Is also about $50,000,000. V ...
The shipments of merchandise between
the United States and Alaska have been
considered as coastwise commerce and no
reports of the value of merchandise so
transported have been made to the col
lectors; while in many cases the mani
fests are so indefinite In statements of
quantity that it has been. found difficult
to obtain satisfactory ! estimates in detail
of the movements of merchandise into
and out of Alaska. The fluctuation* In
prices of the seal and other furs and the
salmon and other fish, which have been,
until recent years, the chief industries of
Alaska, jjoupled with the fact that in the
official reports only quantities were stat
ed, have In the past rendered detailed
statements of values year by year diffi
cult: The statements which are presented
as to. the industries and' their result from
a financial standpoint are the results of
careful Inquiries from collectors of cus
toms both in Alaska and the United
States by. the various Governors of Alas
ka and their subordinates and by the spe
cial agents of the Government appointed
to report upon the various industries.
The fact that statistical statements of
the commerce and conditions of Alaska
have not been regularly made in the past
renders the attempt to present a picture
of present conditions in Alaska a difficult
one. Necessarily the information is frag
mentary. Aside from the, statistics of
population published by the Census Bu
reau and statements of the number of fur
seals taken by the lessees of the-Pribllof
Islands, the number of cans of salmon
packed, and the number of fish taken as
reported by the special agent i of the
Treasury Department, and statements of
the gold production 'reported by the Mint
Bureau, little' information of a statistical
nature is available. Even these reports
are extremely meager and In most cases
the statements are simply those of quan
tity unaccompanied by estimates of value.
When the Hawaiian Islands and Porto
Rico were also made customs districts of
the United States and the collection -of
statistics of our commerce with those isl
ands was rendered impracticable, a meas
ure providing for the collection of statis
tics of trade between the United States
and all of Its non-contiguous territories
was framed by the Bureau of Statistics,
approved by the Secretary of the Treas
ury, sent to Congress, passed and signed
by the President; and beginning with the
new fiscal year the record of trade be
tween the United States and all of Its
rlon-contiguous territory will be avail
able in form similar to that of commerce
between the United States and foreign
countries. *
This statement is presented at the pres
ent moment both by reason of the grow
ing interest in -Alaska and especially be
cause of the fact, that the Bureau of Sta
tistics is, to publish In future monthly
statements . of the I commerce of Alaska
with ports of the United States. - Hereto
fore no detailed statistics of commerce
with Alaska have been obtainable be
cause, of the fact that no provision of law
existed for the collection of statistics of
commerce Â¦ between customs districts of
the United States; and as Alaska was by
law a customs district such ' statistics
could not be gathered under the law.

COMMAND TO PEERS.
Following is the King's command to the
peers and peeresses to attend the corona
tion:
"Whereas, the 26th day of June next 13
appointed for the Bolemnity of our royal
coronation, these are to will and com
mand you (all excuses set apart) to make
your personal attendance on us at the
time mentioned, furnished and appointed

vices as shall be required and belong to
you; whereof you are not to fall, and so
we bid you most hearty farewell.

pared, under the direction of the superin
tendent of Indian schools, by the pupils
of the different institutions. This work,
which will show the practical education
the Government is giving its wards, is to
be displayed at the headquarters of the
Department ' of Indian Education, West
Hotel, Minneapolis. An Indian girls' man
dolin club, a band and a baseball club will
also be features of this department that
will attract much attention.
From the colonial contingents angry
protests are being registered. It appears
that the War Ofllce arranged that all the
troops specially sent to the coronation
shall,, with the exception of the cavalry,
be utilized to line the route of the proces
sion, instead of actually partaking. in It.
As the major part of the visiting con
tingents consist of infantry, the arrange
ment has created bitter disappointment.
The Governor General of Canada,
Earl Minto, the High Commissioner of
the Canadians/Lord Strathcona, and Lord
Pellat, in command of the Canadians, are
doing their utmost to induce the War
Office to allow the cojonial troops to take
part in the procession as units, regardless
of the arm of the service to which they
may belong.
Alexandra Park, where the' colonial
troops are encamped, is now a perfect
morass, thanks to the heavy rains. The
accommodations for the troops are inade
quate and many of the officers, refusing
to stay in the tents, have taken rooms
near by. Â¦
ANGRY PROTESTS.
CORONATION GAMBLE.
A brisk business was this week done at
Lloyd's in the coronation gamble. The
odds given were 100 to 3 against the event
occurring, or to use the technical expres
sion, the rates on the risk of the King
living until June 26 ruled at 3 per cent
premium. Many thousands of pounds
sterling were underwritten on this basis.
This shows to what extent the public
nervousness has, grown in certaiu. circles.
Careful investigation reveals that there Is
no ground for believing that the King's
health Is any worse than the official re
ports Indicated. His nerves were rather
upset by the unfortunate illness at Aider
shot, and every precaution is being: taken
to prevent a recurrence of such a sudden
indisposition, j .
In the meantime preparations for the
crowning hurry on apace. Such Illumina
tions, festooning and beflagging as will
mark coronation day, Thursday next,
have never before been seen in London.
Some of the most elaborate displays of
the metropolis will be by American firms
doing business here.
"Further complications have been avoid
ed thus far. The King takes dally drives
In a closed carriage, and the present op
inion of his advisers is that it will be
possible for him to undergo the corona
tion ceremonies on Thursday next."
"On Sunday the King remained In bed,
and on Monday he had so far recovered
that he was able to be taken to "Windsor,
reclining upon an improvised couch in a
closed carriage. The medical attendants
felt considerable anxiety on" account of the
twitching of the muscles of the face. This
sympton continued on Tuesday: morning
and was followed after noon by a slight
stroke of paralysis of the left side..
The most circumstantial of the reports
concerning the King's health is the fol
lowing, the authority for which Is named
as being "a personage In attendance on
his Majesty": â¢ : ; "
"For months pastille health of the King
has been far from good, and the strain
Imposed by preparations for the corona
tion culminated a week ago , In a severe
nervous breakdown. This was followed
on Tuesday last by a stroke of paralysis.
On Saturday last the King, against the
advice of Dr. Laking, declared himself to
be able, and attended the military review
at Aldershot. During that afternoon his
Majesty complained of a headache and of
weariness, but he refused' to retire. Later
In the evening a serious collapse, mental
and physical, followed. . ' . .

Crime That Arouses

The trial was held under the most com

wind blowing at the time and the crowd
was so dense that it gave the juggler
little room In which to move around.
After the trick was done Bedini said it
was the hardest he had ever performed,
and he felt quite jubilant over the result.
One of the turnips hit him near the right
eye, and he will carry around a decorated
face for jsome time to come.
It looked good to the crowd arid all eyes
were focused upon it as it rapidly ap
proached the little man who held the two
pronged fork between his teeth. .It seemed
to come straight to its mark and the Jug
gler steadied himself for the daring
catch. A mighty shout went up as
Bedini made a last effort and stabbed
the turnip square In the. center.

When the long fingers of the town clocks
pointed to the hour of noon the lampers

ignored and the various cafes and restau

fully took his bearings, wound his arm
like a windmill and dug some dust out

began to descend like a rocket.

ly two weeks he has been violent, keeping
up a constant screaming and shouting ana
annoying his fellow prisoners with wild
talk about his extraordinary powers. HÂ»
declares that ho is commissioned to de
stroy the Jail first, then Monterey County
and finally the world. It la said the Dis
trict Attorney has asked that the matri
cide be examined by the Insanity Com
mission to determine -whether ho Is sham
ming or not.
ure of the oil supply of Beaumont is ex
pected, and that is the reason that his
corporation has not taken a more lively
interest in that section.
Concerning the progress of the Kern
County oil refineries the Bakersfield Cali
fornian says:
The refineries being built In the Kern River
field are all making satisfactory progress
toward twmpletion, the one farthest advanced
being the Union, which is also the largest. It
Is stated that it -will start its fires next Sun
day mornins. bi^t this information is accom
panied by the statement that the date may be
a few days later. ThÂ« Union has six great
stills and has just finished putting in its third
3500-barrel tank.- It Is situated on the rail
road near the. Standard's storage tanks and a
track runs the length of an immense iron ware
house, enabling all the work to be done under
cover. The King Company is showing much
activity in the preliminary excavations for Ita
refinery and from present Indications will not
allow any time to be wasted before gettin?
Into shape to handle oil. A large force of men
Is engaged at work.
Consolidation of oil Interests Is taking
place in Texas on lines similar to those
laid down In California. Several Texaa
companies have combined to form the
Star Oil Company, which has an author
ized capital of $10,000,000. The amalgamat
ed company has a pipe line eighteen miles
long, leading from its wells to Port Ar- .
thur; four storage tanks of 50,000 barrels
capacity each, two 33.000-barrel tanks,
thirty-two large settling tanks, and Is now
building additional storage tanks, accord
ing to the reports, that will aggregate a
capacity of 650,000 barrels. The movers
in the enterprise are principally men from
Iowa. Â¦
The pipe line of the Standard Oil Com
pany, coming north from Bakersfleld to
tide water on the bay, has reached Ken
r.ell, Kern County, about forty miles
south of Hanford. The construction prog
ress on the line is at the rate of about
one mile per day. Below Hanford nearly
300 men are employed. The force will be
Increased to double its present size. â¢ To
push the work the force is divided into
four gangs. The first puts the pipe to
gether, the next digs the trenches, which
are two feet wide and about three feet
deep on the average; the third wraps the
plpo in a prepared covering to protect it,
and then the fourth fills up. the trenches.
The work is systematized, and this en
ables the company to progress atithe rate
of thirty miles each month on the way to
the bay of San Francisco.
Talk about the proposed McDonald rail
road from the Kern River oil field to the
ccean at Port Harford continues. All
sorts of predictions are made concerning
the price at which oil will be transported
to Port Harford. The Bakersfleld Cali
fornian says that a freight rate of 15
cents per barrel is promised. The- same
paper says that a survey has been partly
completed and that the entire length of
the proposed line is 115 miles. . .
An official of the Standard Oil Company
is reported by the Los Angeles Herald to
have said in New York that an early fail-

Is Being Rapidly
Completed.

The three men in a" buggy who, held vp
Attorney T. E. Pawlicki at Van Ness ave
nue and Post street about 10:30 o'clock
Friday night attempted to hold up M. iJ.
Levy of 2003 California street at Sutter
and Goush streets a few minutes later.
Levy was walking with his wife up Gough
street from Geary and at Post street a
buggy containing three men drove up at a
furious gait and turned up Gough street.
When Levy and his wife reached within
fifteen feet of the" corner of Sutter street
a man holding a revolver in his hand and
with the lower part of his face covered
with a white handkerchief approached. Â¦
Levy, divining ! the man's ".. purpose,
struck him a vicious blow in the stomach
and another on the body. Another man
came up and Levy fought them both till
the man with the mask fell back toward
the corner followed, by the other â¢ man.
When Levy reached the corner he saw
the two men Jump Into a buggy In which
a third man v.as seated and they drove
vest on Sutter street. Levy ran after the
buggry till he saw it pass Laguna street.
He returned and found that his wife had
fainted and had been taken into the Ma
jestic Hotel. Police whistles were blown
all the time, but no officer appeared.
Detectives Reynolds and Riordan, who
were detailed on the case, discovered that
the horse and buggy, which were found
at O'Fsxrell and Gough streets by Police
man Harris, had been stolen from Bush
and Dupont streets about 7 o'clock Friday
night and belonged to H. Schottler & Co

SUMMER FROLIC.
Give the brain and body food during
the summer that does not overtax the
stomach and heat the bods'.
Grape-Nuts is a crisp, dainty and deli-
cious food, selected parts of the grain
treated by heat, moisture anfl time to
slowly and perfectly develop the dias-
tase from the grain and transform the
ctarch into grape sugar in the most per-
fect manner: the small particles of phos-
phate of potash found in certain parts of
the cereals are retained and these ele-
ments vitalize and nourish the body,
brain and nerve centers.
In its predigested form, it furnishes the
pecessary strength and energy in an
easy way for the system to absorb with-
out undue exertion and removes the
general feeling of heaviness usual to hot
weather.
Grape-Nuts and cream, a little fruit
and possiblV an egg or two cooked to
suit the taste, is an ideal breakfast and
â¢will fully sustain the body until the noon
day meal. Delicious desserts for luncheon
end supper can be quickly made and have
'flavor all their own from the peculiar,
mild but satisfying sweet of the grape
Grape-Nuts will save the heat of cook-
ing and the exertion of preparing food;
vMll make you feel internally ten degrees
cooler and fit you for the summer's heat
bo that you may enjoy the full pleasures
mi the season.

Croker's visitor says he has no doubt
that It is the ftJrmer Tammany chief's
serious intention. He describes Croker's
resentment against Sheehan as intense
even violentâ for a man of his self-con
trol. Croker talked a long time lo him
about Sheehan's course In Tammany poli
tics, recurring frequently to Sheehan's
statement that he (Croker) got $1,500,000
out of the Third Avenue Railroad wreck,
through his reputed connection with
Naushton & Co.
When Croker's guest asked the former
chief why his stay here was to be so brief,"
he set his jaw and thumped the table be
fore which he was standing with his fist
and replied: .' '
"I'm going back just long enough to
smash John Sheehan's face."
NEW YORK, June 21.â Richard Croker

PITTSBURG, June 2Lâ The conference

complished nothing-, as usual. Neither
side offered any concessions. However,
there Is a disposition on the part of the
miners to accept a compromise, and If a
settlement is reached It is not believed
that the miners will favor a general
strike, even should one bo ordered by the
national convention next month.
PARKERSBURG, W. Va_, June 21.â
"Mother" Jones and eleven others who
were arrested at 'Clarksburg yesterday,
charged with violating an Injunction of
the United States court, were released to
day on $300 bonds and their hearing was
set for Thursday next "Mother" Jones,
one of the dozen, spent last night In jail
here, refusing to be taken to a hotel as
la, mark of special courtesy, saying she
would stay by "the boys" through thick

In the meantime word was sent to

Iron policemen were sent down and ar
rived there shortly after 7 o'clock. They
were hooted ; but were not attacked.
Everything la now quiet about the col
lieries.
The crowd was attracted to the collieries
by the Importation of new men to take
the places of strikers. Deputy Sheriffs
were hurried to the place from Potts
vllle, and after the riot act had been read
the crowd waa persuaded to disperse.
Shortly after 6 o'clock the mob gathered
again and several workmen were attack
ed as they came out of the place. They
were badly used up. A coal and iron po
liceman who came to their rescue was
stoned and clubbed, but waa not serious
ly hurt.. The superintendent of the col
liery would not allow his men to make any
move or to use their revolvers, and in a
short time the crowd also scattered.
SHENANDOAH, Pa..' June 2Lâ There
was an exciting demonstration In the vi
cinity of the Lehlgh Valley Coal Compa
ny's four collieries at Lost Creek. This
morning about 800 men and boys gather
ed at this place, threw stones and roughly
bandied several non-union men and club
bed a coal and iron policeman. The Sheriff
of Schuylkill County finally dispersed the
crowd.
EXCITING DEMONSTRATION.
Daniel J. Keefe of Detroit, national
president of the Long-shoremen's Union,
arrived here late this afternoon and called
on President Mitchell. Both said it was
a social call. Keefe said the miners'
strike had made work slack among the
7000 longshoremen who handle anthracite
coal. When asked what his organization
would do In case the miners asked for
aid he said: "Nearly all of our men are
working: under agreements, and they
never have broken one. I do not know
what our organization will do if the
miners ask us for aid, but I do no't think
that they would break agreements In
order to help out another organization."
Nothing developed at strike headquar
ters to-day bearing on the question of
Involving the bituminous men in the an
thracite strike.
The" statement will probably" shov the
alleged relationship between the hard
coal carrying- railroads and the large coal
Â¦companies, and will try to show that while
coal has been advanced the rate of wages
paid to the miners has rot kept pace with
the increase. It .will also call attention
to the prosperous condition of the counr
try and will contain a plea that the mine
workers should enjoy a share of It.
PLEA FOB THE WORKERS.
The national president declines to say
anything: regarding this statement, but it
is understood to be a reply to the oper
ators' letters published ten days ago. It
will be a complete review of the miners'
side of the controversy.
President Mitchell held a conference
with District Presidents Nicholls, Duffy
and Casey this morning. District mat
ters were discussed. Among the business
considered' was the public statement
which President Mitchell will issue to
morrow night. 'â¢' â¢â¢':â¢' 'Â¦Â¦Â¦:Â¦ \ .
WILKESBAURB, Pa., June 2Lâ The
anthracite mine workers' strike rounded
out Its sixth week to-day without serious
incident. The strike of 1900, when the
men won a" 10 per cent increase, lasted*
exactly six weeks. In that struggle the
lives of several persons were, sacrificed,
but in this strike the worst that has hap
pened was the shooting two weeks ago of
a boy who is now slowly recovering.

candidates Into the mysteries of Wood
oraft at Woodward's Pavilion last night.
The main body of the big building was
arranged in the form of a camp and
decorated by Neighbors Kahn and Lassan
in the semblance of a miniature forest,
with the station of each officer in a bower
of boughs and ferns. Outside of the lines
of the camp were arranged rows of chairs
which were occupied by the candidates,
while the members of the order occupied
the seats back of rails and those
in the galleries. . Â¦ ;.
The ceremony of initiation was conduct
ed by Mertoa C. Allen as past consul
commander, P. F. Gilroy as commander,
Thomas J. Barry as advisor lieutenant,
D. L. Fitzgerald as banker and J. J. 3>on
ohue as escort, assisted by the ritualistic
team, of Maple Camp of Centervllle, Cap
tain H. W. Lynch commanding.
The several officers. In full regalia, were
escorted to their respective stations by
teams of the camps in uniform..
The music incidental to the ceremony
was led by Golden Gate Camp's orches
tra, Neighbor Hyman leader.
Previous to the initiatory ceremony
there was an exhibition drill by the
drill team of Mission Camp, Captain
Stewart; Â¦ then one by the drill team of
Golden Gate Camp, ' Captain Healey; also
one by the team of North End Camp,
Captain Waugham, â¢which was attired
in the new uniform prescribed for teams
of this character. It consists of a dark
blue military fatigue coat, army cap, pat
ent leather leggings and black belt with
silver buckle. Each, team introduced new
and intricate movements that were loudly
applauded. At the termination of the
drill, each captain was presented with a
box of cisrars for bis men, -
In the initiation, the work was exempli
fied with but one candidate, Steve V.
Costello, who entered the hall in charge
of t he escort, preceded by the three de
gree teams, after which the charges by
the several, officers were delivered in a
most solemn and impressive manner. The

Oppoatt* Union Square.The largest cyanide plant west of Utah
commenced running last week at the Vandalia
mine in El Dorado County, a few miles east
of Shingle Springs. This property is owned by
John Rosenf eld's Sons of San Francisco and
has recently been enlarged to 200-ton capacity.
The mine and plant are under the management
of Messrs. Charles E. Seymour and C. F. Sta
ver. Last December ground was broken Cor
the new plant, which, when completed, will
represent an investment of nearly $150,000.
There Is no well denned ledge on the property,
the ore being found in a vast body, constitut
ing practically a mountain of gold-bearing
Quartz. Power and lights for the plant are
supplied from crude oil engines. The main en
gine is fitted with a compressed air starter
and also with electric switches at six different
points in the mill, by which the machinery may
be almost Instantly stopped.

mine produced a lot of rich ore, but it has not
been worked for many years. The snow in the

RICH STRIKES REPORTED.
' The Grass Valley Union and ' Herald
says:
The large operations of the Mountain
Copper Company at Keswick are thus
summarized, by the State -Mineralogist:
From the Iron Mountain mine the Capper
Mountain Company has extracted, since 1896,
about 825,000 tons of ore. which has been car
ried by a narrow-gauge railway eleven miles
down the canyon of Slick Bock Creek to the
company's smelting plant at Keswick, one mile
west of the Sacramento River. The matte and
blister copper here produced and shipped to the
company's refinery in New Jersey have pro
duced iLbout 120,000,000 pounds of fine copper
to January 1, 1902. Dividends to December 31,
1600, amounted to considerably over 60 per cent
of the capital stock of $6,250,000. With very
large ore reserves, with a recently enlarged
and improved smelting plant of about 1000 tons
dally capacity, with a total force of about 1200
men- and with annual local expenditures of
nryst $2,000,000, the Mountain Copper Com
iit.es.y is a large factor in sustaining local In
dustrial prosperity, and has a considerable fu
ture, period of profitable operation.
It Is impossible to find space to review
â¢ he eritlro volume. In its contents are
detailed accounts of all copper deposits
in the State so far as they have been dis
covered and also many maps and pictures
illustrative of the copper industry In Cali
fornia.
Ehaxta. County's copper belt is composed of a
series of ore deposits arranged in the form
of a crescent, which bends through the low
mountains ana foothills directly north of the
bead of the Sacramento Valley, and which
spans a distance of about twenty-five miles
between the eastern and western horns. The
apex of the Sacramento Valley plain and the
city of Redding are near its western end and
but a little couth of the chord of the arc dc
ccrfbed by the belt. Iron Mountain, at the
end of the western horn, is about ten miles
northwest of Redding in a direct line, and tha
eastern horn, in the Furnaeevine district, Is
about twenty miles north of east from the
came point The length of the belt is ap
proximately thirty miles, and the width from
or.e-hall to four miles. The term "belt" in
used with the broad meaning which it properly
carries, and not as synonymous -with "lode."
The ore deposits do not mark a practically
continuous fissure system in which directly
related vein formations have resulted, but oc
cut as disconnected masses, or groups of vein
formations, forming individual lodes and dis
tricts. These groups of deposits vary In form
of occurrence from massive, flat-lying, lenti
cular beds of sulphides on the west, to ir
regular vein formations in the eastern half of
the belt and they also vary in their minerali
zation; but they are successively ranged, with
considerable regularity, along the curved line
described, forming a belt three or four miles
â¢wide in places. In several ways this series
of deposits presents features of unity and in
dividuality, which enforce its conception as one
definite mineral belt.
The copper belt presents many favorable con
ditions for copper mining and smelting. There
are diEtributed through a long mineral belt
maselve ore deposits whose quantities, as well
as values, are attractive to conservative min
ing capital. These deposits are usually em
bedded in great hills, and can be economically
explored and mined through tunnels. Water
is especially abundant, and desirable sites for
reduction, works are conveniently available.
Opportunities for the generation of electric
power are widely present. The belt is bisect
ed by a main railroad lice, and highways reach
the various districts. Climatic conditions â¢ are
all favorable. The wood and timber supply is
ample.
lEOU MOTTNTATN" OPERATION'S.
SHASTA'S GREAT BELT.
California" Â» copper deposits have a remark
ably wide distribution, being scattered over the
length and breadth of the State and occurring
In practically every one of its fifty-seven coun
ties. Thousands of deposits have been sub
jects of mining locations at different times and
hundreds have yielded at least a few tons of
merchantable ore as a result of superficial pros
pecting. There Is hardly a county in the State
which i>as not at come time made at least
small contributions to the copper supply. Small
deposits, usually small bo far as revealed by
slight development, are scattered at varylrfg
intervals along the borders of the State and
throughout every section of It except in the
detrital deposits of the valleys. The deposits
of economic importance are mainly concen
trated in certain belts and districts which re
quire chief consideration. For convenience the
deposits are grouped in four geographical divi
sions. Shasta County, the Coast Range, the
Sierra Nevada Range and the general arid
region of Southeastern California,
The leading copper district of California Is
in Shasta County and th.is promises to remain
cf overshadowing Importance for a good while.
Here is a series of copper deposits forming a
curved belt nearly thirty miles long. Of sec
ond importance is the copper belt of the â¢west
ern slope of the Sierras., which in territorial
magnitude is not rivaled in the world. Here is
an almost continuous series of copper deposits
etretching north and south about 400 miles.
While the Coast Kange displays copper deposits
throughout its length of 500 miles, its import
ant copper districts are in the northern por
tion, extending for about 150 miles southward
from the Oregon line. Except in Del Norte
County, in the northwestern corner of the
Etate, where several mines were productive of
considerable Quantities of shipping ore nearly
forty years ago, the deposits of this range have
not been developed beyond the most superficial
prospecting in a few instances, but surface In
dications point to the existence of cupriferous
veins cf sufficient size and value to warrant
development and the expectation that this
great mineral region will Include profitable
copper minâ among Its Industries.
Ac Interesting feature of thÂ« copper
volume is a table showing the growth of
the copper industry in the State from the
year 16S7. In that year the output, in
value, was $132,000. It Increased the fol
lowing year but fell as low as $3502 in
1S90. The figures did not pass the million
collar mark until 1S37, when the- total
value was $1,5-TJ,666. The year 1838 brought
the total up to $2,475,168, Tl-e following
year the ag-gregate value Â«f the output
was $3,990,534. In 1900 the figures were
$4,748,242. Describing the Shasta copper
belt in general terms the volume on cop
per lias the following:
HAVB WIDE RANGE.
There are copper deposits outside of the
great copper belt of Shasta County, â¢ in
tSiskiyou, Del Norte, Trinity, Humboldt,
Tehama. Glenn. Colusa, Mendocino. Lake.
Napa, Sonoma, Marin, Alameda, Merced,
San Beuito and San I.uls Ob.spo counties
in the Coast Range; also in ihe Sierra

Placer, El Dorado. Amador. Calavcras,
Alpine, Tuolumne. Mariposa, Madeta,
Kittsuo, Tulare and Kern counties; also
In Mono, Inyo. San Bernardino, Riverside,
San Diego and L.cs Angeles counties.
Concerning the condition of the copper
industry the volume says:
The copper resources of California make
the theme of an extremely Interesting
volume of nearly 300 pages that has just
been issued by State Mineralogist Aubury.
The many deposits of the red metal in
this State make an imposing Ehow'in the
recapitulation. California Is now the
iowth copper producing State in the
Union. Its copper output in 1901 amount
ed to 34.S31.7S2 pounds and was valued at
Â£5,501.782. While Michigan, Montana and
Arizona greatly exceed this output the
fcgures of thÂ© world's production show
California to be one of the most import
ant sources of the world's supply. That
the output of this State will continue to
increase largely there is no doubt.

beads and almost new. There was a pair
of gold-bowed spectacles and $4 in' silver
in the purse. On her fingers were two
rings â one a cameo of a woman's head
and the other a gold wedding ring with
"March 1L 1867, 1 " engraved on the inside. .

The San Francisco team went in against
this moderate total with F. Bennion and
E. H. M. Lannowe, the latter compiling
14 runs. The only other batsman who
scored double figures was W. H. Mc-
Naughton, 14 not out. Rooker and Chand
ler compiled 7 each, and T. W. Tetley,
who went in last, ran up 7 runs quickly.
The score was tied and Tetley looked
good for at least a few more runs when
he ran out to a ball sent down by Coles
from the south end and was stumped by
Punnett, the match ending In a tie.
Coles took five wickets and Bull captured
fcur. The full details follow:
Quex, Arsenal, Hermis, Corrlgan and Pente
cost also ran.
None of the players were accustomed
to a grass pitch, .all their practice hav-"
ing been on concrete covered with mat
ting. The turf was untrue and heavy,
causing the ball to bump or shoot. Mann
Qounty went to the wickets first, with
G. Hellman and C. P. Coles. The latter
made the. highest scpre of the day, 24, in
cluding two fours, and a three. The only
other batsmen who made much of a
stand were J. J. Theobald, who {--cored 14,
and A. F. Chambers, who scored 7 runs.
The side was dismisesd for a total of.-56
runs. Storrs took tour wickets for 27
runs, Casidy two for 6 and Acklom. two
for one run.
A MARIN County cricket eleven,
captained by C. P. Coles, played
a tie game with a San Francisco
team, captained by H. C. Casidy,
yesterday on the recreation,'
ground in Golden Gate Park.
The Angels were about due to land the
cash and glory from the Ponies yester
day at the Eighth-street lot. .Neverthe
less, Morley sent the same old familiar
sentences on the south wire: "Luck still
passing us up, but wait till to-morrow
and we will hand them a few." This was
all the consolation the southern magnate
could get out of his troubles, but he will
have to do things in order to show the
Ponies if they keep up their winning can
ter. The score read 2 to 1.
SAN FRANCISCO.
The fan? turned out in numbers and all
were given a good lime for the two-bit
piece which was passed up to the man at
the box office. The game was fast and
well played throughout, and looked like
an extra-round light till Danny Shay
slapped one out In the direction of the
ilag-pole in the ninth, scoring Tacks Par
rott from first.
Glendon and McPartlin fought against
one another for the entire nine rounds.
Glendon had a trifle tho better of the ar
gument throughout, being more steady
than the big twirlcr from the south. Not
a hit was made for six long spasms,
v.hen t-ach team got together long enough
to locate a safe place on the diamond.
The Pony hit was made by Parrott and
produced a run, while the AnÂ»el drive
came from Roach's bat, but no one
crossed the plate.
The contest was notable for several
things. Danny Shay scored a clean triple
in the ninth, but is only credited with a
single, as the winning run was scored on
it. Bobby McHale dropped his first fly
on the local diamond, the disaster occur
ring in the ninth, when Householder
popped a high one to left field. The most
important feature is that the Ponies by
winning out are in second place for pen
nant honors.
Glendon began the sixth with a bunt
in Beilly's direction. Reilly fell down in
fielding the ball and the runner was safe
on the error. Nordyke then sacrificed
and Holly flew to right, but Glendon
beat the throw to third. Parrott scored
him with a double to left field. It took a
bad bound over Jackson's shoulder.
Reilly drove the sphere to left in the
eighth, and Raymer sacrificed him to sec
ond. Roach placed a long single into the
right garden, and the score was tied. The
Angels had three men on the sacks in
the ninth, but could not manage to hit
Eafely, so all were left at the post.
Parrott opened the pony portion of the
last spell with a hot grounder past thirds
Leahy bunted out to Reilly. Danny Shay
â¢was there with the long drive to the flag
pole, which ended the fighting. The

No sooner did It become plain that the
favorite was really in distress than Otis
also began to cry enough. With a fur
loiife ttill to run, both were straight as a
string and it was plain neither could stay
In front to the wire. Then it was that
Lyne made his move on Wyeth. He set
the colt down and the son of Wadsworth
and Fonso came away past the leaders
with little effort and a hundred yards
from the wire was hailed as the winner.
Lyne kept him going and at the same
time had a little in reserve in case some
of the others should come from behind
w'.th a rush. He was watching for this
and saw Lucien Appleby and Aladdin
coming fast to the finish, but all he had
to do was to keep his horse going to stall
off their furious rush. Woods and Coburn
were driving hard through the last six
teenth of a mile, and they certainly got
the most out of their respective mounts.
It was not in Lucien Appleby and Aladdin
to beat Wyeth, and he passed under the
wire a winner by almost two lengths.
Summary:
First race, one mile â Wainamolnen won,
Federal second, Jiminez third. Time, 1:44 2-5.

Otis, Heno, Prowl, Belle's Commoner, Lord
Hi- ran on with bulldog courage, but
could not shake off Otis, which had
closed up much of the gap the Western
colt opened around the turn. Belle's
Commoner, Wyeth and Aladdin now ap
peared to be running more strongly thau
the two leaders, and those who are quick
to discern when a racehorse is approach
ing the beaten point raised a cry that
neither Heno nor Otis would get any of
the money.
There was no change in the order down
the back stretch, but when a mile had
been completed Bullman seemed to- think
the time had come for him to make his
run with Heno. It was a poor piece of
jockeyship. Heno, when let down, drew
away from Otis and went round the far
turn, increasing his lead until fully three
lengths in advance. Otis hung on gamely
and it was not long before Heno began
to show signs of coming back. As they
rushed round the last turn to the straight
run for home, Heno had still the honor
of holding first place, but the effort was
costing him dearly.
HENO SHOWS HIS GAMENESS
His stride was beginning to shorten per
ceptibly.
The story of the race, is soon told.
There was little delay at the post and
Starter Dwyer got them away to a good
send off. Otis and Heno at once showed
in front, with Wyeth last. Round the
turn from the half mile post to the head
of the stretch the field came thundering
along at a good pace. .Otis and Heno
had drawn clear of all â¢ contenders and
already were fighting for the lead. Past
the stand the same pair were running
head and head, well in front of the field,
on the outside of which were Arsenal
and Corrigan, both a little too far back
to please their backers. Round the club
house Â¦ turn went the flying leaders. By
this time Aladdin had taken third place,
closely attended by Belle's Commoner.
Wyeth had moved up from last place
and had passed Prowl, Pentecost, Lord
Quex, Lucien Appleby, Hermls and Ar
senal. When half the distance of the race
had been completed Heno and Otis still
held a commanding lead, and showed no
sign of tiring. Belle's Commoner and
Wyeth were the nearest attendants, al
though Aladdin was still well up and on
the rail. Coburn apparently preferred to
drop back to fifth place rather than hus
tle his horse, with half the race to be
run.
WYETH IS LAST AWAY.
One of the best features of the race
won by Wyeth was that he got off last
after the fall of the flag and wore the
field down one by one. Striding along
in irresistible style, without any appar
ent effort and at the same time getting
over the ground grandly, he appeared at
all stages of the race to be running well
within himself, although passing one
horse after another and evidently travel
ing the fastest. They never had him
"straight" and his neck was not stretched
until the final sixteenth. Even then he
was far from being out, and he clear
ly won Â¦with a little in reserve.
The real surprises of the race were Lu
cien Appleby and Aladdin, who finished
second and third, respectively. Lucien
Appleby would have been conceded a good
chance had the track been heavy, but
when the -dust was seen flying as the
horses went to the post for the first race
on the card, those who had placed their
faith in him in the future books gave up
their bets for as 'good as lost.
There is no room for argument about
the best horse winning. The race, free
from rough riding .or anything in the na
ture of "a* foul, was cleanly and truly
run. Wyeth was the best of the twelve
3-year-old colts that lined up at the bar
rier to-day before Starter Dwyer. Jockey
Lucien Lyne rode a sensible race on Mr.
Drake's colt. Heno, the heavily played
Eastern colt, went to the post -the' favor
ite at 2iÂ£ to 1, but failed to finish inside
the money.
CHICAGO. June 21.â Coming with a
sweeping stride through the stretch, the
game colt. Wyeth, owned by John A.
Drake, won the American Derby this af
ternoon at Washington Park. The tra
ditions of the race were upheld by the
overthrow of the favorites and by the
Western horses beating the best that

The story qt the . big varsity race is the
record of a hard struggle for all six crews
for four .long miles.' For almost a mile
the long' graceful shells were lapped in
the struggle. Over the second mile Cor
nell began to gather ' her lead. Columbia
hung ; to Wisconsin for second place with
a deadly grip, while Georgetown was al
most nose and nose with the New,York
ers, with" Pennsylvania and Syracuse only
a few feet behind. This was the order of
the boats up to the last half-mile, where
Pennsylvania spurted, and finally 7 Syra
cuse jumped ahead of Georgetown a few
yards from the finish. t
FAST TIME IS MADE.
In i the four-oared Pennsylvania was
second, but in the varsity race the Quak

freshmen race they were fifth. The Uni
versity of Syracuse beat the Quakers for
fourth. place in the freshmen event, and
in the varsity Syracuse fought George
town out in the last few lengths, beating
the boys from Washington by less than
a yard at the finish line. In none of the
races were the records touched, but in all
three events the times were not far, from

5 Cornell finished three, good lengths
ahead of Wisconsin. A length and a half
separated the Wisconsin and Columbia
boats, while the Quakers were nearly two
lengths behind the New Yorkers. Syra
cuse was not more than fifteen feet be
hind- Pennsylvania, and Georgetown was
less than 1 a yard behind Syracuse.
At the three-mile flag the race seemed
to bo .over, for Cornell was. two lengths
ahead. Columbia had dropped back to a
length and a quarter behind the Badgers,
and three crews in the race. . But . the'
Badgers were not yet P whipped. Once
more they spurted . and once more they
cut. down Cornell's lead by a . quarter of
a length before the Ithacans had reached
the three and a half mile flag. There was
more power,' however, left in the Cornell
boat, and the Ithacans simply laughed at
the Badgers and then' let out for the
finish, i': â¢ <Â¦';-â¢ â¢ . â¢
The Badgers were still ready ; to bet
they would win the race, and their hopes
went up again as their crew, rowing at
two points lower per minute, passed the
two-mile flag, with Cornell barely seven
eighths of a length to the good. The same
distance s-eparated the Wisconsin and Co
lumbia boats. Two and a half lengths be
hind Columbia, Georgetown, Syracuse -and
Pennsylvania were still nip and tuck.
Over the next half mile Cornell began
to make up what she had lost. Little by
little the Ithacans pulled away from the
Badgers, ' until they were leading by a
full length. Columbia clung to Wisconsin
without losing a foot, while Georgetown.
Pennsylvania and Syracuse were once
mere almost even. , - / -.
At the end of the first mile Wisconsin
had cut down Cornell's lead by v half. a
length and the Ithacans were barely a
quarter of a length in the lead. Columbia
dropped back half a length more behind
Wisconsin; Georgetown was a quarter of
a lengthbehind Columbia, with Pennsyl
vania ten feet, in .the rear and Syracuse
a half length behind. .-
At the quarter-mile the Ithacans had
their shell ' a good quarter of a boat's
length ahead of the Badgers. At. the
half-mile the six shells had begun to as
sume final relative positions in the racÂ«,
which could now be easily measured. Cor
nell was leading by a three-quarters boat
length over Wisconsin, with Columbia a
quarter of a length behind the Badgers.
Georgetown, Pennsylvania and Syracuse
were pulling in the order named, only a
few feet separating the noses of their
shells. ' / Â¦
CONTEST IS A CLOSE ONE.
,ll> was almost 6 .o'clock when Referee
John Eustls, asked the varsity men if they
were ready and fired his pistol. All six
crews -got away, in good style, but the
Cornell boat soon began to creep ahead.
At the end of the first eighth of a mile
Cornell had a lead of ten feet over Wis
consin, while the other four shells were
zigzagging alongside the Badger's cocks
wain.
sin was leading the New York boat by
only, a .length and a half. Georgetown
held fourth place up to the last half-mile,
when the Quakers pulled away. The
Washington - boys struggled hard, . but

place in the struggle.',

The fair has been remarkable for Its good
order and for the absence of objectionable fea
tures or disreputable practices. It has been a
place where gentlemen could take their wives
and children at all times with perfect freedom
and propriety. The amusements have been
clean and attractive and I feel constrained to
say that you gentlemen have shown to no bet
ter advantage than in the moral tone of your
management. We have had a week of merry
makingâa day off. as it wereâ from the cares
and trials of ordinary business, and we have
enjoyed It all the more because it leaves no
bad taste in the mouth. We have had thou
sands of visitors from all over the State who
have praised the enterprise and public spirit of
Oakland, and expressed surprise at the beauti
ful exhibition made on these grounds.
1 think every citizen of Oakland Joins with
me In expressing gratification at the manner In
which you have carried out your self-imposed
'task. The fair has been a credit to Oakland
and an honor to the Elks. The generous pat
ronage extended to your enterprise testtilea to
the public appreciation of your efforte, and Is
a heartly recognition of the attractions you
have presented. That â you have gained the
financial rewards your undertaking deserves is
as cheering to me aa it is satisfactory to you.
I think all the residents of the city heartily
rejoice that you have succeeded beyond the
measure of your expectations.
A CREDIT TO OAKLAND.

It was to this aspect that Mayor Bar

address at the closing of the fair. And
he said further:
ATTENDANCE WAS LAEGK
More than 80,000 people passed through
the gates to-day, swelling the total num
ber of admissions during the carnival to
more than 130,000, a figure almost double
that which before the fair was opened
it was estimated would attend.
Oakland and the neighboring cities re
sponded in a way that has not only de
lighted the promoters of this street fair,
but has given the city an Impetus calcu
lated to be of inestimable value. That
element of the carnival is one which men
of affairs In Oakland have found an en
thusiastic subject of discourse. That
Oakland can attract from without has
been so splendidly demonstrated that the
city has been invigorated beyond the
fondest hopes of the business men who
lent their assistance in this week of
OAKLAND, June a.â With the re
frain of Bobby Burns* homely
verse, "Auld Lang Syne," ring-
Ing through the immense throng,

Hundreds of Elks were gathered about
the grand court and music pavilion, where
the closing ceremonies were witnessed by
thousands, who Joined in the music so
familiar to every Elk and so appropriate
to the finale of the splendidly successful

But we count ourselves fortunate that
we're not compelled to mark up our regu-
lar prices a good stiff per cent. We would
be compelled to do so if we had not antici-
pated the recent advance In duty rates on
London dyed skin*, and Imported an un-
usually large stock before the new tariff
went Into effect. Most stores would wel-
come thl* excuse for Increasing- their profits.
But profits arÂ« not the whole thing: In
business. Your good will; making new
friends: changing a dull month into a busy
one â each Is more than extra profits to us.

Which comprises twenty- five pieces, and has a
reputation second to none in the West Â¦ is a
leading feature at this city of tents, and' there
is an outpouring of the entire population every
evening "when the band begins to play." This
continues from T:30: to 9, when those inclined
repair to the. pavilion, where they dancfe until
11 o'clock. - ' â¢ .

In various ways. 1 One gentleman, â¢ Judge Bea

organization of the British Empire. How
woefully mistaken they have been! The
outcome of this war had been'the joining
together in bonds that no power on earth
can sever not only of the sympathies of
Englishmen, Scotchmen and . Irishmen,
but of .the empire beyond the sea, Can
ada, Australia, New Zealand, parts of the
empire separated from the mother land
by. thousands of miles of ocean, who had
shown by their enthusiastic support, of
the old land in its time of trouble that
the hearts of all those who dwelt under
the shadow of the dear old flag beat In a
mighty unison that no combination of
Britain's enemies could destroy." During
the evening a collation and refreshments
were served. Â¦ -

NEW YORK, June 21.â To-day's dull and
professional stock market calls for little com
ment. An advance of over a point in United
States Steel was a sustaining force in the
opening dealings. The demonstrative buying
of the brokers usually employed by the syndi
cate helped this movement, j The Southwestern
railroads made some show of strength, St.
Louis-Southwestern preferred rising 1%. ' The
effect of these movements extended far. The
v/hole list turned heavy upon the appearance
of the bank statement and the closing was
easy, with prices slightly below last night for
the most part. The bank statement showed a
gain In cash of less than $1,000,000, while the
estimates had been for nearly $3,000,000. The
deposit liabilities were increased by a loan ex
pansion of nearly $8,000,000. The net result
was an encroachment upon the surplus reserve
of $1,144,100. On the eve of preparation for the
July settlements the showing was considered
disquieting, especially in view of the continued
firmness of foreign exchange.
The market for bonds has been quite active,
but rather spotty and Irregular.
United States 2s advanced %. the 3s and
old 4s registered % and old 4s coupon % per
cent. The r.ew 4s declined % per cent^as com
pared with last week's closing call.
The organized campaign to advance prices
of stocks, which has been in evidence for some
time past, gathered volume and force this
week and carried prices up with a general
sweep onward Wednesday, with, the largest
dealings for one day since the early part of
May. On Thursday there was a movement to
take profits by the bulls and an aggressive at
tack by the bears, which* caused a sharp re
action and a pause. The unexpected Increase In
the stock of the Illinois Central and the grant
ing of rights to stockholders ! to subscribe at
par pave the whole market its fill upon Wednes
day and helped the bulls to take their profits
with the first appearance , of . the general out
side market that has been aroused. The man
ner In which unfavorable news was Ignored on
the rise is shown by the prominent position
taken by the Reading stocks In advance In spite
of the miners' strike and the continued paraly
sis of the anthracite trade. Professions of con
fidence In Buccess of crops and suggestions of
probable increases of dividends on railroad
stocks were the ostensible motives of the buy
ing of the grangers, which were prominent in
the upward movement. I The Gould ctocks as a
group, led by. Missouri Pacific, were also con
spicuously strong because pt an appreciation
of the Improved strategic position of these prop
erties in the railroad world by reason of recent
acquisitions and extensions and the belief that
a financial plan for consolidation of, operation
1Â« being worked out. There were rumors : of a
contest for control of Reading on the part of
the Pennsylvania and Its subsidiary, company,
13 & O. The making perpetual of an injunc
tion against the conversion of $200, 000, 000 of
New York Stock Market.
CHICAGO, June 21.â Clearing weather and
lower Liverpool cables brought a sharp de
cline In wheat at the opening. Paris was a
little higher and there seemed to be some con
flict in opinions as to the real conditions and
tendencies in that market, American fields
were given a respite from rains and the prom
ise was for clear weather. On this news July
opened ragged, %@l%c down at 73%@73%c,
and after some small rallies dipped to 73c. I
Traders who had been consistently bullish for
a week turned . sellers. Commission . houses
liquidated freely and many stop-loss \ orders
were executed > for bulls who came Into the'
market as buyers only yesterday. September
was subjtcted to some sharp selling, but De- I
cember was supported' a little. Very good
seaboard clearances helped in a rally "late, but
the- close was weak. July on the rally sold
to 73%<Â§>73%c, , but closed -%@%o down at
73%@73%C' .. .-.Â¦: . Â¦ Â¦ â¢ .
. Corn ended Its. week's work , In a lagging

ditions and â¢ the wheat slump, however, corn

good decrease on passage. Visible supply on
Monday is expected to ; show moderate de
creases. Market here Â¦was weaker on easier
Liverpool and clearing weather. This brought
about the natural liquidation after the buy
ing of past few days on rains. Very little news
from the wheat fields. The tendency- of ad
vices so far is to show a disappointing result
in tfce threshing, with a slow and probably
moderate movement and a good demand from
interior mills. On anticipation of these con
ditions we think wheat should be bought on
soft spots. .

"Fall wheat Is generally headed and is In
bloom In come early localities. Cool weather
is very favorable for the wheat In bloom, and
it 5s desirable that It should prevail through
out the filling season. The spring wheat is
Â¦well rooted and stooling well. - That on sum

"The week was one of cool nights and mod

The weather, according to all reports, was

All kinds of Berries were in free supply and
choice lots met with steady sale, but there was
a lot of poor stock received that had to be sold
below the quotations. There was strong In
quiry for choice Currants - at steady prices.
Poor stock went to canners and peddlers at the

The six boxes of black Figs that came in

Cantaloupes from Jndio did better, there be

Most of the ripe fruit in the State Is being
shipped East from the orchard districts and
the receipts in this market consist chiefly of
culls- and green stock, which accounts for the
prevailing low prices. Good ripe stock sells
readily when obtainable, but other stock drags.
Receipts of Cherries were plentiful and prices
showed little change, but the demand is grad
ually falling off. The Cherries from the river
are poor and nearly always sell at the lowest
quotations.
Oranges were easier owing to the Increasing
competition of other fruits and prices were
lower for all kinds excepting Navels, which
were In very light supply. There will be two

sentiment. \Vith the Northern Securities pro

of judicial disapproval is thus thrown over
the two most Important financial projects of the
recent era of expansion.
In the money market call . loans have been
easily negotiated, but the outlook for the fu
ture is not felt to be clear. The demand for
time loans has been a feature as it was the
week before. The advancing tendency of ster
ling exchange here and its decline In Paris
has called renewed attention to the large obli
gations of this market to foreign lenders 'and
the coming effect upon our money market of
the maturing of these obligations. The dis
count rate has advanced at Paris and that cen
ter has withdrawn funds from London, which
in turn has sold securities here, creating a de
mand for. exchange to pay for them. The for
eign trade statement for May issued this week
by the Bureau of Statistics > shows the small
est trade, balance in our favor for any May
since 1894. owing principally to the heavy fall
ing oft in the volume of exports of all classes
of agricultural exports. The exhibit Is dis
quieting on account of the expanded condi

Eastern Livestock Market.
The Financier says: The official statement
of the Associated Banks for last week showed
as the most striking- feature an Increase of
$7,944,700 in loans.. This was not altogether un
expected, for the speculation on the Stock Ex
change was active during the week at generally
advancing prices, thus calling for Increased
bank accommodation.? Moreover, there was the
beginning 1 - of the accumulations of money pre
paratory to the July disbursements. The specie
increased $919,000, while the legal tenders fell
off $42,100, making the net increase in cash re
serves, $876,900; the eBtimated gain was $2,5S8.
800. The interbank movement was quite uni
form throughout the week, as also were the
sub-treasury operations, and the difference be
tween the official and the estimated gain in the
previous week was slight, so that it is altogeth
er Improbable that the actual changes in that
week i could have been reflected In the return
last week. Possibly the discrepancy between
the actual and the: estimated gain in cash in
last week's statement was partly due to for
eign, exchange operations, which were Im
portant.. Another explanation is that the trust
companies during the week probably drew con
siderable amounts of Â¦> cash from the banks in
order to strengthen their reserves preparatory
to the making of their semi-annual statements
to the State Banking Department. The de
posits were. $8,084,000, or $737,600 less than the
amount called for by the increase in loans and
the net ' gain In cash ; therefore, the statement
was not entirely harmonious. The required re
serve was increased $2,021,000, deducting there
from in surplus reserve, making this item $12,
158,250, against $6,611,150 at the corresponding
date a year ago.

The army transport Hancock docked yester
day afternoon at Folsom-street ' wharf. * She
would have left her anchorage off Angel Island
early In the morning but for the breaking down
of her 'windlass, which prevented the raising of
the anchor. When the Hancock arrived Friday
evening" the army steamer General McDowell
went alongside with Major Rafferty, the depart
ment sanitary Inspector, on board. No sooner
was the army boat made fast than the sol
dier passengers on the transport commenced
passing cigars to a quartermaster on the j Mc-
Dowell. ' Customs- Inspector Montell discovered
the open door, seized one bundle containing a.
hundred cigars and ordered, the McDowell's
lines cast oil. ...

When the British ship Monkbarns arrived on
Friday she had on board United States Cus
toms Inspector Sprague, who had Joined her off
the Farallones. Sprague has been specially de
tailed to try to catch some of the more enter
prising boatmen â¢ whose zeal for business'- Is
Interfered with by the United States quaran
tine regulations and who have been ( in the
habit of boarding foreign ships outside - the
heads. Sprague has been on the Farallones
two weeks. The Monkbarns was the first ves
sel he board. When about seven miles
out one of Crowley's launches Â¦ came alongside.
Captain McNeeley of the Monkbarns Is not
famous for his cordiality and fortunately for
the boatman he made no effort to board > the
limejulcer, and Sprague' s detective stunt yield
ed no harvest. Surveyor Spear says he wants
to catch a nice, fresh boatman. There is a
law to fit the case and he thinks the effect of
securing even one conviction would do much to
make all boatmen respect the law. Inspectors
will be stationed on the Farallones at Intervals
throughout the summer.
Watching the Boatmen.
A number of sailors deserted the British ship
Monkbarns on Friday, soon after she dropped
anchor. The men give the ship a hard name.
Sailors' stories may usually be taken with a
grain or two of salt, but the words j of the
mate soon after the ship anchored would
seem to bear out the men's complaint that
their desertion was far from being objection
able to the ship's officers. The mate watched
the men go over the Bide, saw the boarding
masters help them take out, their clothes bags
and chests. He smiled and turning to a Call
representative who was on board said: "They
tell me we got here Just In time; that after one
or two ships get their crews no more men will
be wanted, ' and we couldn't have got rid of
those fellows at all."

THE Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company's liner Gaelic
Balled yesterday for the Orient
with 8400 tons of cargro and about
a score of cabin passengers. The
cargo Included 800 tons of flour,
shipments of which to the Orient have
been rare since the tramp Arab loaded up
the Chinese and Japanese markets.
Among the cabin passengers was E. W.
-Tilden, agent for tho the O. and O. and
Pacific Mall Companies at Kobe. He has
been visiting: In the States for several
weeks and was accompanied by his wife
and child. J. V. Knights, proprietor of
the Orlente Hotel at Manila, was also a
passenger. .. : Â¦
Eight ChinesÂ© were deported on the
Gaelic and there were fifty-eight Chinese
passengers. Of the latter one woman ar
rived just before the steamship hauled
away. She had been taken from a life of
slavery by a Chinese whotnarrled her and
who accompanied her home on the Gaplic.
About 300 Chinese women surrounded the
gang plank, in anticipation, it is said, of
a .scene. Nothing happened and the al
mond-eyed bride toddled up ' the gang
plank amid a chorus of sympathetic
grunts.
The Gaelic carried treasure valued at
$175,000. . Â¦ â¢
The passenger list was as follows:

mation to the correspondent.

SPEAK BY THE CARDâ Subscriber,
Alameda, Cal. Originally card was the
name for the mariner's compass. When
the man at" the helm was asked the
course of the vessel he looked at the com
pass, and he thus spoke by tho card.
Hence, to speak by the card meant to
speak with absolute correctnessâ true to
a single point.
GYPSIESâ Subscriber, City. Whence
gypsies originally came is a question that,
after having passed through a long stage
of helplessly absurd speculation, has of
late years been dealt with by competent
investigators, both linguists and histo
rians, but is still only partially solved. So
much, however, seems now almost estab
lished that India the cradle of many na
tions, was the source from which they
sprang. JL.
CUTTING CARDSâ M. R., Oakland, Cal.
In cutting cards in euchre or in any other
games the cutting of three or more is
"a cut," but less than, three is not. It la
not customary to "cut the pack into
three or more portions, placing the sec
ond on the first and so on," but .this
department does not know of any law of
cards that prohibits such a practice. If
a player is offered the pack to "cut" and
he refuses, the pack should be passed to
another player.

MEETING A LADYâ Bashful, San Jose.
Cal. This correspondent writes: "There Is
a young lady I have met several times
away from her home and would like to
meet her oftener than I can at such
places. Is it proper for me to ask if I
may call at her house or should I wait
until I am asked?" If the young lady,
after having met you several times, has
not asked you to call it is evident that she
does not desire your company other than
when she meets you away from, her home.
TUXEDO COATSâ F. A. H., City. Of
late years the Tuxedo coat is superseding
the swallow-tail coat for full-dress func
tions, and the reason for this is that wait
ers have adopted the swallow-tail coat
while engaged in their profession. Gen
erally the Tuxedo may be worn at almost
any function, but there are a few stick
lers who insist that the other should be
worn. It would, however, be improper, so
long as swallow-tails are not tabooed, to
wear a Tuxedo in being presented to high,
dignitaries on the occasion of a social
event.
MILLIONS FOR CALIFORNIAâ F..
City. In the treaty of Guadalupo Hidalgo,

of the claims of United States citizens
against Mexico amounting to $3,250,000.

eral Joseph Reed, a delegate from Penn

rated, or in the case of a composition by

TAMALESâ C. G. M.. City. This cor
respondent, in a letter to this department
in referring to the definition that was re
cently given of Tamalpais, writes: "I
doubt if the Board of Geographical Names
at Washington, D. C, would indorse your
statement that said tribe of Indians were
called either 'Tamales' or, Tomales.* If.
you refer to the Pacific Coast Pilot, by
Prof. Davidson, you will find many refer
ences to Tamal Indians and Tamalpais."
If the correspondent had read the answer
carefully he would have noted that the
word "Tamales" was not used, but that
the word "Tamal" was used, and if he
knew anything about grammar he would
know that Tamales Is the plural of Tamal.
consequently it Is doubtful if the Board
of Geographical Names would not indorse
the name published. The same as to
To males, as that is the plural. It is pos
sible that in the long, long ago, Tomales
Bay wa3 named Tamales Bay, but com
mon usage has converted the name into
Tomales, and it is so published in a num
ber of the geographies. The fact that
"some of the restaurants in this city have
on their bill of fare Tamales Bay clams'*
is not authority that "Tomales" la not tha
name of the bay, - , . â¢

The shrewdest persons who study the
future of this city have the most confi
dence in it. This is shown by the several
moves of the United Railroads of San
Francisco In the line of extension of serv
ice which the growth of traffic will
jnetlfy. It is also made manifest In a
striking way by the enlargement In plans
Cor large buildings before the period of
construction has been actually reached.
Of considerable significance has been
the move of the street railway people to
furnish to Richmond a better car service
than it has ever had, which is all that has
been lacking to give a new impetus to
that very desirable section of the city.
Of value as indicating the trend of af
fairs has been the acquisition of land in
Oakland by the Santa Fe Railroad Com
pany, announcement of which has Just
been made, for depot purposes. % !Tt has
aiways been evident that the Santa Fe
Â¦would enter Oakland. There was never
any reason to doubt that the great trans
portation line presided over by Ripley
Â¦would eventually Intrench Itself on equal
terms with the Southern Pacific Com
pany on the east shore of the bay. All
that adds to the growth of Oakland helps
also San Francisco. Every sign is favor
able for a revival of the realty activity of
a short time ago after the vacation season
has been passed.
There is the customary summer lull In
the local realty market. Capitalists have
gene to the country. . Transactions T>f all
sorts I of business are carried on with a
little less visor than at other times of the
year. There is nothing in the fact that
realty gales have slackened that should or
can Jar the public confidence in the future
of the values of realty in San Francisco.
The city and all the communities about
the bay are having 1 a steady and healthy
growth. Business houses in this city are
extending their trade by the institution
of branch houses and manufactures and
Ehipplng are Increasing-.
Transactions for the Last
Week Give Standard
of Prices.
Conditions Contain Full
Promise for Many
Large Deals. v
