5T. LUCIA, May. 1 1. â The first relief parties have ventured into the
streets of St.. Pierre. It , was not expected that . survivors ' would : be
found, and so there has been no disappointment at < the mournful ! re
ports that have been returned. â¢ <Â¦
All of the earlier stories of the disaster .worked; by - Mont,; Pelee i have
been verified. The destruction of the city is complete. Not a buildirigVre
mains standing. The desolation is beyond description.
Piles of dead in the vicinity of the site of the cathedral tell a' story of
the attempt to find sanctuary, and refuge in the great structure of Â¦ worship'.
Men and women, panic-stricken at the cataclysm, , turned < in the moment of
their despair to the cathedral and were apparently overcome before they
could reach its doors. ' ;
So far the search has 'been hindered by the -fires that are still raging and
the investigators are in gneat! danger. '-* Mont Pelee is 'active,' but the erup
tion is subsiding. In St. Pierre every form^of life 1 . apparently: ; has been de

any legal technicalities being raised by
accounting officers.
AID FOR ST. VINCENT .
No word reached the State Depart
ment to-day regarding the conditions
on Martinique or on the island of St.
Vincent, which is also said to have suf
fered from an earthquake. Cable com
munication with St/ Vincent, as well as
with Martinique, has been interrupted,
according to information . in possession
of the State Department, and this prob
ably accounts for the fact that the Unit
ed States has not heard from Ernest A.
Richards, its consular agent at that
point. Mr. Richards is not a citizen of
the United States, but a British subject.
He was born in St. Vincent and has al
ways resided in the island. He was ap
pointed' consular agent upon the â¢rec
ommendation- of the American Consul
in Barbadoes. â¢ -
The preservation of order in Martin
ique will probably be a matter of some
importance. The French man-of-war
Suchet, which is at Fort de' France, will
undoubtedly land officers and men
should their presence be required. . The
cruiser Cincinnati, which is expected to
sail to-day from Santo Domingo, will
arrive at Fort de France bv Tuesday
night, and Commander McLean will
tender the use of parties from his ship
if the French are unable to prevent law
lessness. The men sent ashore will re
Â»pect the sovereignty of France and will
co-operate in every way possible with
the French guards. There are warships
flying. the British and Danish. flags in
the waters of Martinique and they, too,
will aid in every way, -it is believed, in
preserving order and in giving such re
lief as is possible to the people who are
actually in need. - -p- :
It was suggested to-day that the trans

The city reeks with a horrible odor of burned flesh. /In one instance
an entire family of nine persons were found/ all tightly locked in each other's
arms.
Those who have come back here from the city report that the streets and
all the neighborhood around are now incumbered in all directions by heaps
of bodies. Most of tlie dead bodies thus far seen were naked7 their cloth
ing apparently having been burned from their bodies like so much tinder, while
they themselves were roasted to.death. In the vast majority of instances fires
seem to have been the sole cause of death.
FORT DE FRANCE, Martinique, May 11. â A landing has been suc
cessfully made at St. Pierre and the work of exploring, the ruins ot the devas
tated city has begun. Although it will be several days before the full extent
of the havoc wrought can be ascertained, enough has been learned to indi
cate that the very worst anticipations are more than realized.
The hands of the clock had ; stoped at precisely ten -minutes to 8 o'clock,
showing ithat it was at that moment that the city was and all
the thousands|of people, within, it and in its environs were destroyed..
Clock's Hands Supply an Imported
Along the .water front there are a few walls' standing and the. ruins of the
Custom-house were found. ; The face and hands of the clock on the- hospital
were not destroyed and arid they furnish an important record, in the history, of
this terrible catastrophe. V ;
The entire quarters of the fort and of the Carbet are completely leveled to
the ground, forming nothing but heaps of ruins^ covered thickly over with
ashes, cinders and masses of mud and lava commingled. What horrible reve
lations of the havoc wrought to. human life which these mounds are yet to
reveal can hardly be imagined. Iri;these two quarters of the city not atrace

guard by the soldiers. In the country there is no fopd and it is believed that
thousands are starving. As soon as food can be obtained, relief parties will
be sent out from Fort de France.
Almost the first thing done' was to make preparations for the crema
tion of the dead. Fatigue. parties of soldiers built enormous pyres of wood
and branches of trees, upon which they heaped the bodies by scores^ and
burned them'as rapidly, as possible. To facilitate the combustion and to de
stroy as far as possible the awful odor of burning flesh which came from them,
the impromptu crematories were heavily soaked with coal tar and petroleum.
The total number of dead is now estimated at fully 25,000. The disaster,
itself took place within thirty seconds, and. in that half-minute the vast ma
jority of all these people were killed. *
Steamers are also going back as -rapidly as possible to the scene of the
disaster, carryings with them provisions and clothing. The 450 persons
brought here by the cable ship Pouyer Quertier were from the neighborhood
of the village "of Precheur/ 'They were entirely without shelter when found,
but none of them were burrred or injured.
Every ship in the harbor at the time of. the disaster, with the single ex
ception of the English steamer Roddam, was burned, and all on board were
lost, excepting one captain. feSSfi
v In relating his escape, this captain says that the only way in 7 which he
managed to save his' 1 life was by repeatedly diving. He was an expert swim
mer and was able to remain under water for a considerable length of time. .
He returned again and again to the surface, barely exposing his face fora mo
ment or two to the terrific heat and thus getting enough breath for another
long dive. .â¢ ' "

heavy thunderstorm. Our stevedores were
busy hustling the cargo when suddenly
there was a deafening explosion and the
earth trembled violently. We all looked
toward Pelee and I saw the most appal
ling and terrifying sight of ray Hfe. I
thought the end of the world had come.
A great sheet of flame leaped from the
mountain top, followed toy spurts' of flame
and smoke alternately like the puffing of
a locomotive on a dark night. Then an
other great sheet of flame leaped hun
dreds of feet Into the air, followed by a
great lot of smoke and lava. It continued
to spout forth lava and emoke for appar
ently a minute or two. though I suppose
actually it was only a few seconds.

were soon blazing.
"Then came a great tidal wave,' which,
careened our ship. I thought sure we
had gone clear over, but the Roraima
balanced herself, and then settled back
to rights with a great lurch. Our masts
and funnel were swept away. Only two
lifeboats were left. I was almost killed
by being dashed against a stanchion. It
was several seconds before I could real

i bending over me, and rocks and ashes
were raining down on the deck all about
me. I was then hauled into the steerage.
Many sailors, who had sought safety
there, were uttering agonizing shriek's
with the pain of burns. They were roll

a stevedore finally came to help 'me to
a better place several corpses were piled

said he, "Mont Pelee was throwing out
smoke and ashes and an hour or two
later, after we had hardly anchored, the
volcano belched forth -an enormous
quantity of fire, smoke, steam, mud and
ashes. A loud rumbling preceded a
heavy explosion that fairly made our
ship tremble and rattled down all the
dishes in our saloon and galley. The
water : around us whirled, eddied and
foamed. A great wall of lava swept
down the mountain side, over the town
and into the bay. It struck us broad
side and almost overturned the Rod

shelter in the cabin, forecastle and the

Colonel Barry, when seen, spoke in the
same strain. "Mr. â¢ Findlayson and myself
had been close companions for years,"
said Colonel Barry. "We lived together
and I transacted all of his legal business
for him. He was never married to my
knowledge, and I don't anticipate that
either a widow or an heir will turn up to
lay claim to his wealth."
The funeral will take place Wednesday
morning at 9 o'clock from the residence
of Countess Ingargolia, 905 Eddy street.
These arrangements were made at the re
quest of Findlayson's relatives. The body
will be interred at Cypress Lawn Cem
etery.
"Uncle James was only a friend of
mine," said Countess Ingargolia, when
seen last night at her elegantly furnished
flat on Eddy street. "We all called him
Uncle James, and perhaps that is the trea
son why my position in this matter has
been strangely misunderstood. I do not
intend to be a contestant for nig wealth,

such an impression has gone abroad.

friend. The statement that I demanded
his keys and papers is absolutely untrue.
I -wanted to see his interests protected
from designing persons while he was alive
and now that he is dead I hope to see his
last wishes acknowledged and expressed
in his will carried out to the letter. Mr.
Findlayson's sister knew the friendly in
terest I took in Uncle James and the fact
that she desires the funeral to take place
from my house is convincing enough to
show that my position in the matter was
never for a moment misunderstood by
those who held him dear."
COUNTESS IS GBIEVED.
Colonel Barry was the custodian of
Findlayson s absolute confidence. He
Knew his history well, and in ' business
ueals Findlayson often sought his advice.
-That," explains Colonel Barry, "is the
extent of my interest in this case.'
So it in now "up" to the known rela
tives of Findlayscn unless, of course, a
widow or an heir turns up to press a
claim to some of the wealth of the dead
the will, which will probably be
filed for probate in the next few- days,
Findlayson has provided for his two sis
ters llrs. William Patterson of this city
and Mrs. McKinnon of St. Louis. He
left them each the sum of $20,000. To a
certain Mrs. Mascn, who seems to be
unknown to the friends and relatives of
Â¦Findlayson, he bequeathed the sum of
515 000 A nephew, who lives. in Canada,
is mentioned for $3000. ' Two nieces of
the dead man, who reside in Alameda
County, were cut off without a penny.
The residue of the estate is to be di
vided among ten charitable institutions,
including, it is said, the Children's Hos
pital, the Jewish Orphan Asylum and
the Old People's Home. The bequests to
the charitable institutions cannot, ac
cording to law. exceed one-third of the
value of the estate.
Those who knew the affairs of Findlay
son say that since he made the will, fite
vears ago, his estate has increased enor
mously in value. If this is the case the
relatives mentioned in the document will
receive larger amounts than was original
ly bequeathed them by Findlayson at the
time he made his will. Â¦
SOUGHT BARRY'S ADVICE.
Neither Cocntess Ingargolia nor her
legal adviser, Colonel A. C. Barryv both
of whom were intimate friends of the
late capitalist, James Findlayson, will
be factors in the threatened cocntest over
his vast estate. This much of tlie tangled
squabbte ov*>r the dead man's "wealth
is straightened otft by the positive state
ments of Countess Ingargolia and Colonel
Barry that thev do not intend and never
did intend to participate in any way in
the struggle which has already com
menced in the courts. Countess Ingargo
lia readily admits that the dead man
was not related to her in any way, and
states that she has no interest in the
future disposition of his property. She
explains her interest in his welfare while
BliVC by saying that he had roomed at
her house for the last seven years, and
that he was "just like one of the fam
ily." It was her habit to call him
â¢â¢Uncle," just as it was that of others
who lived with him under the same roof.
Colonel Barry states that he has been
a lifelong friend of the deceased, and
that he once drew up a will for Fmdlay
eon, which the- latter subsequently de
stroyed.
The Temps, in an editorial . this morn
ing, remarks that so many matters of
public interest have occurred this week
railroad accidents, the disaster at Mar

Never before have I seen such carnage

i The latest reports received here showed
that lava continues to pour down the
slopes of the mountain, slowly engulfing
the whole north side of the island, while
fresh -crevasses arÂ« continually opening.
The work, of^relief is progressing here
on the most extensive scale possible, but
in anticipation of disturbances the treas

The .450 survivors who were brough t
here- yesterday from the vicinity of St.

Pouyer Buertier came from the town . of
Le. Precheur, where, surrounded on all
sides by flowing lava, they -were nearly
roasted-, to death and expected moment

.The inhabitants of Fort de France were
panic-stricken the morning of , the disas
ter, when "the sky suddenly blackened un
til it was as dark; as midnight. The sea
shrank back thirty ..yards and hot, rain
began to fall, while, gravel the size of wal
nuts poured down on the town. This last
ed about fifteen minues.
Throughout .Thursday \ the- heat, in the
vicinity of- St. Pierre was so intense and
the stream, of flowing lava was so unre
mitting. that it was impossible to ap
proach the town|d~uring the early part of
the day. As evening approached the
French truiser Suchet, after a heroic bat
tle' with the heat, suffocation and sulphur
fumes, succeeded in' making a dash to
ward, the shore, nearing the land close
enough to ' enable her tq take off thirty
survivors, of Â» the disaster, all of whom
were terribly burned and. mutilated. St.

â' A commission was appointed'- by the
Governor to investigate the outbreak and
it returned , a ; reassuring report on Wed

McGrath further said that a ship of the
Trinidad line, plying between the same
ports as the Grenada, would arrive in
New York a week from Wednesday, and
in "all probability would have plenty of
news of the disaster.
"The people in Grenada seemed to think
a great deal about the noises while we
were there," said McGrath', "and from the
talk I' heard I judge they were frightened.
We put out from. Grenada on the 4th and
passed Martinique about 8 o'clock the
next morning. Our course carried us
about fifty miles from the island, and
as the morning was clear,, we could see
the mountains in the distance. The whole
chain of islands down there are likely to
go off like that at any time. I tell you
it is a bad place, and I wonder anybody
lives there." - â¢

aster on Martinique first reached the
Grenada while off Sandy Hook. He was
not greatly surprised. â¢ .

The result of 16S reballots out of a total
of 174 shows that 128 Ministerialists and
forty anti-Ministerialists have' been elect
ed. The Ministerialists gain nine seats
in the Chamber as a result of the rebal
loting. The Government majority is ma
terially strengthened. The Dreyfus
champion, Joseph Reinach, Republican,
whose reappearance in political life was
one of the features of- the elections, has
been defeated in his district of the de
partment of Basses-Alpes.
The -Deputies elected include Clovis-
Hunues, the Doet Socialist, while Vivani
and Allemans, Socialists, were defeated.

feated. ' ' .
The reports indicate that the reballot
has been favorable to the Government, as
half the Ministerialists, including Legues,
the Minister of? Public Instruction; Bris

reported occurred at Marseilles, where

PARIS, May 11.â The Parisians in those
municipal districts where reballoting was
held to-day for the election of members
to the Chamber of ' 'Deputies crowded
early to the polls. They voted quickly,
and then j proceeded to enjoy * themselves
in their customary Sunday manner. The
voting was- especially heavy, and there
was much animation, especially in the
Twelfth district, where the Nationalists
concentrated their forces in an effort to
defeat the re-election by reballot of M.
Millerand, the Minister â¢ of Commerce.
Millerand, however, secured a small ma
jority! * -.
Throughout the evening the boulevards
and .the streets in the neighborhood of

that trafhc was suspended. .The excite

crowd was good natured and orderly.

SHAMOKIN. Pa., May 11.â The local of
ficials of the mines in the Shamokin dis
trict owned by the Philadelphia and
Reading Coal and Iron Company, the Un
ion Coal Company and the Mineral Rail
road and Mining Company were notified
by their respective companies last night
not to hire men to cut coal during the
suspension of the United Mine "Workers.
Samuel Nedroy, a representative of the
American Federation of Labor, said .to â¢
day that the federation would render all
possible aid to the miners.
Shamokin Mines to Suspend Work.
It was reported to-day that an effort
will be made to start up the Cranberry
breaker, operated by A. Pardee & Co.,
with non-union stripping, so that all the
coal that was not sent to the surface .on
Saturday may be prepared for market.
The stripping men to-day, however, say
that they will under no -conditions take
the places of strikers at the mines.
Meetings of the United Mine â¢ Workers*
locals were_ held In most of the mining
villages in the Hazelton district to-day,
and delegates were elected to the coming,
convention. It is impossible to ascertain
the attitude of the locals on the question,
as the meetings were secret.
. The Lehigh Valley Coal Company an
nounced to-day that it will give employ
ment to all men who report for work to
morrow. â¢ v^t : â¢ '
HAZLETON, Pa., May 11.â Anticipating
the action of their employes, two of the
individual coal companies in this -region,
Coxa Bros. & Co., operating the Beaver
colliery, and Calvin Pardee Sons & Co.,
owners of the Lattmer mines, have noti
fied their employes that they need not
report for work until ordered to do so.
These companies, it is believed, expect
a long struggle.
Meetings of all the locals will be held
to elect delegates to the Hazleton con
vention.' The sentiment among the more
thoughtful and intelligent miners is op
posed to a continuance of; ,the strike.
These men will use as one qt their chief
arguments the significant fact that the
companies' mine officials are not soliciting
their merv4;o vote against the strike, while
at the same relative time in the fast strike
these same officers were working day and
night to discourage the men from strik
ing. The story that the Morganlzed fleets
will be used to. import coal and prevent
a famine does not cause President Mitch
ell any evident concern. He dismisses it
with the remark that the United States
is now exporting coal to all parts of the
world.
. The strike has already made itself se
riously felt in other lines of work. The
railroads have laid off four- fifths, of their
coal train crews, in all about 800 men, and
the Erie shops at Dunsmore, where mine
cars are repaired, will be shut down In
definitely to-morow, throwing .' 300 ' men
out of work. J
SCRANTON, Pa., May 11.â There will be
no coal mined in the Scranton end of the
antharicte region to-morrow. Even though
the strike order was not certain of being
religiously obeyed there would be no min
ing, as the companies have agreed that
no attempt would be made to operate. The
companies will not admit that the agree
ment to refrain from an attempt at op,e
rating is eventually to resolve itself into
a lockout should events at Hazleton make
such a thine possible. .

the disaster surpasses all that imagina

WHAT YOD DO, DO IT WELL.
This Is Important for Health
BQilding in May.
To get rid of rheumatism, neuralgia,
dyspepsia and nervous complaints it is
wisdom to use Paine's Celery Compound,
a medicine that proceeds at once to make
the appetite normal, sleep natural and re-
freshing, the nerves strong, as a founda-
tion for building up health and vigor.
If sick people in May look for a true
nerve strengthener, an honest blood 'puri-
fier, a reliable diuretic, that will restore
strength, renew vitality, regulate the kid-
neys, liver and bowels, they should at
once make use of Paine's Celery Com-
pound and note the speedy and pleasing
results that flow from its use.
"What you do, do it well," is the golden
rule of business life. This rule and far-
reaching command can be profitably ob-
served in many other conditions of life.
In sickness "and suffering It is all-impor-
tant that "what you do" to banish dis-
ease and restore lost health should be
well done. While prudence and common
sense will, in nearly evert instance, di-
rect you aright, the experience of your
friends and neighbors and the thousands
rescued from sickness and suffering will
point directly to Paine's Celery Compound
as the infallible health giver.
People who think they will get rid of
troubles such as rheumatism, neuralgia,
dyspepsia and nervous disorders by medi-
cines which have not yet passed the ex-
perimental stage will be sadly disappoint-
ed and find their sufferings increased.
Should Convince You of Its
Value.

Robert Palmer Sr.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 1Lâ Dr. P. C.
Palmer, one of Kansas City's best known
physicians, has fallen heir to a share in
the estate of a millionaire uncle who died
recently in California. The, name of the
deceased relative is Robert "Palmer. He
passed away at Havilah, north of Los
Angeles.
It was through a peculiar circumstance
that Dr. Palmer learned of his uncle's
death. A brother of the doctor, Albert
Palmer, died in Topeka, Kans., a week
ago. On the body of Albert was found a
letter signed by Robert Palmer Jr., a son
of the California magnate. This letter
was very brief. It announced the death
of Robert Palmer Sr. and said:
"Father has remembered all of the rel
atives in a substantial manner in his
will."
Dr. Palmer will go to California at once
to look after his interests.

"WASHINGTON, May 11.â Senator Raw
lins, senior Democratic member of the
Senate Committee on the Philippines, to
day expressed the opinion that a vote
cculd be reached on the Philippine gov
ernment bill toward the end of the pres
ent week. Other members of the commit
tee think the date of the vote may be
postponed until some time next week, but
none of them place the vote later than
the 24th inst.â two weeks hence. They
say that whenever the debate is exhaust
ed they will agree to vote, but that they
object to naming a day for a vote until
they are quite certain that there Is noth
ing more to say pertinent to the subject.
The consideration of the bill this week
will be interspersed with consideration of
appropriations bills, Monday being set
apart for the fortifications bill and Tues
day for the agricultural bill. Neither of
these measures will consume a great deal
of time, and on each day it is expected
there will be time left for the considera
tion of the Philippine bill. Senator For
aker has given notice of a speech on the.
Philippine subject on Monday, and Sen
ator Stewart will speak Tuesday, both In
support of the pending bill.
Senator Spooner also probably will be
heard on the bill during the week. Among
the opponents of the bill still to be heard
are Senators Clay and Money. It is prob
able that considerable debate will grow
out of the speeches of Senators Foraker
and Spooner. Senator Lodge has given
notice that on Tuesday he will move to
met at 11 o'clock each day to facilitate
cpnsideratlon of the Philippine bill.
To-morrow is District of Columbia day
in the House. Special orders have been
made for the consideration of several WH3
to follow the disposition of District busi
ness. They include the bill to authorize
the issue of passports to residents of our
insular possessions; the Adams bill for
the reorganization of the consular service,
and a day for the consideration of war
claims. The conference report on the om
nibus claims bill will also be considered
this week. Such time as remains will be
devoted to the naval appropriation bill.

afternoon. After coailr.g she was boarded by
other passengers, including five sailors for the
barkentine Joseph L. Eviston, now loading

lumber for Australia and while at that port
five of her crew deserted. The Ruth departed

Crowds Visit the "Wisconsin.
Large crowds visited the United States bat
tleship Wisconsin yesterday afternoon and the
owners of launches and light shipping reaped
gulden rewards in consequence. The magnifi
cent warship was in gala, dress for the recep
tion of visitors and the Jackies exerted them
selves to the utmost to render the visit of the
San Franciscans enjoyable. It Is estimated
that 3000 people visited the battleship during
the afternoon.
BERLIN, May 11.â The Incidents in
Wall street absorbed the entire attention
of the -market here during the past week,
and the German boerses were chiefly un
der the influence, of New York. "While
the domestic boerses had a week of light
transactions values were generally firmer.
The securities of foreign governments
were firmer, but Chinese weakened upon
reports of Increasing disorders in China.
LONDON. May 1Lâ There was little
business on the Stock Exchange during
the last week, yet prices were well main
tained and the trade was cheerful. There
is talk of the certainty of peace in South
Africa and its favorable effect upon
prices. In the meantime, however, prices
were stationary, and there have been no
transactions of importance to report.
Americans were weak and uncertain as
a result of apprehension concerning the
strikes and in spite of a favorable crop
and traffic report. Mines were stagnant.

McCune is a former partner of Marcus
Daly, and is largely interested in mines
ir. Utah and Montana, besides owning
heavily in the Cerro de Pasco copper and
silver mines in Vzvn and having large
interests of other kinds. Green is a
youthful mining stock broker.
A telegram has been received from New
York saying that Miss McCune, despite
her father's threats of disinheritance,
was married' there Friday to Philip Er
nest Green of Salt Lake, and that the
bridal pair were preparing to take a
European trip.
Twice they had been foiled in their at
tempts to wed. Once an elder brother
interfered and took the prospective bride
oft the train. Another time the father
sent his daughter off to Peru, where he
is engaged In developing the famous
Cerro de Pasco mines with J. B. Hag
gin of New York and other capitalists.
It was upon her return from Peru that
Miss Mccune was met by her sweetheart,
and the wedding resulted, i

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The Baroda was bound from Callao to
Portland, and was in ballast when she
struck the sandy shore in a heavy gale.
Since that time, nearly two years ago,
crews of men have been engaged in ef
forts to release her, but to no avail. Tfie
Baroda is a fine ship, and her owners
cpent much money in their endeavor to
save her. The failure of the Astoria
to. release her will doubtless be the last
attempt, so that the vessel will now be
left to her fate.
Telegraphic advices received at the
Merchants' Exchange yesterday givo the
information that an unsuccessful attempt
was made Saturday night by the tug As
toria to pull off the British bark Baroda,
which went ashore nine miles south of
the Cocuille River on August 29, 3901.
Every effort was made to release the
vessel from the bed of sand into which
the bow \ras piunged, but she could not
be budged, and she was finally aban
doned to her fate.

The supporters of Governor Henry T, Gage
for renomination lay great stress on the popu
larity of their candidate and his consequent
strength with the voters â with the "rank and
tile" as they put It. This popularity is
based, according - to the rather few journals
who are supporting the Governor, chiefly upon
the economy of his term, and secondly upon
his "fearlessness." That their confidence, or
alleged c6nfldence, is very seriously misplaced
there isn't much reason to doubt. Economy,
while always praiseworthy in all men, par
ticularly those in public office, has many sides
when applied by an executive - officer. "In
whose Interests was economy exercised?" for
instance might be an awkward one to answer.
Governor Gage's administration has been
economical, it is truer but not to the detriment
of himself or his friends, which is equally true.
And where a man has as much opposition in
his own party as has developed against. Gov
ernor Gage, such matters are pretty sure to
be sifted .thoroughly. "Fearlessness," . while
perhaps an admirable trait in any man, . is
liable to be applied along entirely wrong lines.
For instance. Governor Gage demonstrated his
"fearlessness" by supporting Dan Burns for
Senator, but who can say his attitude was not
a most serious and hopeless blunder? Can the
virtue of economy overcome the effects of such
exhibitions of "fearlessness?"
â¢The Herald has no desire to unduly criticize
Governor Gage. This paper supported him
loyally four years ago, and wpuld be pleased
to do . so again under similar" circumstances.
The conditions now. -however, are altogether
different. Instead of a united party back of
him,. Governor Gage would this time be sup
ported by a split and unenthusiastic one. In
stead ' of ' the independent candidate - of four
years ago, which Â¦ was Â¦ his greatest claim for
popularity, he would be recognized as the can
didate of the railroad and the Burns machine.
Instead of being the -candidate of a party de
termined to oust their opponents from office,
he would ' lead a party disheartened , by the
misfortunes of his-: own administration. -Can
the Gage supporters see any difference in these
conditions?" Can they understand how Penn
sylvania, .with .many times the . Republican
majority given to Gage, has elected a Demo
cratic Governor?- Or how the same thing, was
accomplished in Iowa?. .. .

AUBURN REPUBLICAN:
In times past it has been found necessary to enact
laws to prevent frauds in the sale of butter and sev
eral other articles 'of food, and it may yet be neces
sary to resort to legislation to put a stop to the petty
swindling that is too often .practiced in the selling of
small fruits. California has every year an abundance
of good fruit that goes to waste because there. is no
market for it,' and consequently' there^ can be -no ex
cuse in this State, .at least, for filling baskets with
worthless fruit arid selling it. under a false appear
ance given by a layer or two of fine and attractive
fruit on. top. . \ .
For one reason or another the fruit business does
not conform to the doctrine that prevails generally
among. business .men and which is embodied in the
proverb, "Honesty is the rbest policy." It is difficult
to find fruit stands where the various baskets can be
relied upon to have just as good fruit at the bottom
as at the top. Perhaps it is the fault of the producer,
perhaps that of, the packer, perhaps that of the seller;
but nearly always the fault is there,' and the basket
which makes such an attractive showing on the
stand turns out to be a mockery and a fraud when
the housewife takes it home and empties it to see
what she got for her money. \
Probably it would be too much to expect that man
kind will ever pack fresh fruit exactly on the square.
Everybody likes to make the best appearance possi
ble, not only for himself but for his products and for
his wares; and consequently the outward show is
nearly always better than- the substance within. It
is, however, a matter- of common- experience that
those persons succeed best in 'the long run who do
not carry their efforts to make a good show so far
as to produce an actual deception. In well nigh every
line of business it has been found that the dealer
whose goods come nearest to being just what they
appeai;. to be. has the; firmest hold upon the market,
retains the best custom and reaps the largest profit.
WITH the return of the season when straw
berries and cherries appeal to the appetites
of .the public from the fruit stands, there
returns also the old vexation of spirit caused by the
fact that the fruit in the bottom of the baskets but
seldom sustains the promise of the fruit on top.
PETTY FRUIT SWINDLES.
KING CITY RUSTLER:
"With the "elevated political Ideals" of the
present national administration a better time
could not be chosen than now for the Repub
lican voters to unite for Governor on a true,
clean, vigorous and aggressive man with a
record of many years of honest, unremuner
ative fealty and zealous labor in the party's
cause; one who has the intellect of a Clay the
oratory and magnetism of a Webster and" the
honesty and self-abnegation to serve th* peo
ple of this glorious State as a public servant
who would use hia office for the most good
to the greatest number and "not as a patronage
distribution station with the sole aim of fu
ture self-emolument.
Such a man is the Hon. William R. Davis
of Oakland, Alameda County. The better
element of the Republican party knows
him well. Four years ago the unsubsidlzed
press of the State called loudly on the banner
Republican County to pledge its delegations
lor him, but Pardee and Dalton mazuma com
bined to overthrow the "better element" can
didate at that time and the little push poli
tician won out. Â¦
FRESNO REPUBLICAN:
Personally the Governor haa been making
enemies ever since he has been in office He
is tactless, arrogant, impatient and . inconsid
erate. He has not kept his promises, nor
shown regard for the responsibilities of his
high office He has alienated the friendship
of practically all the free newspapers and most
of the free public men of the State. He has
sought to court favor with the thoughtless by
wholesale vetoes and has then forfeited even
that claim by approving much of the most
vicious legislation foisted on the Legislature
by the very pernicious influences from which
he drew his own political inspiration He has
in fact, done everything In his power to ren
der himself an impossible candidate and now
invites the Republican party to Joint Itself
to the fortunes of that impossible candidate
and go- down -to defeat with him. *
The Republican party will not do it. The
machine may send as many delegates as it
can to the State Convention and deliver all
the votes for Gage, but the people, on the
final test, control even a State convention and
the people are opposed to the Governor Call

terests of the people of this State to renomU

INDEPENDENT AND
DEMOCRATIC VIEWS
Comments of the Independent and Dem
ocratic newspapers are Interesting, espe*
daily th.e remarks relative to Mayor
Schmitz. Here are some specimens:
LOS ANGEUES EXPRESS (IND.):
There may , be. in' Mayor Schmitz the making
of a valuable public servant, and as this ar
ticle ls none too plentiful in this or any other
State the i Express devoutly hopes such /may
prove to be the case. This remains to be demon
strated, however, and what better opportunity
to give the citizens of California object les
sons than from the executive . chair of the

Boston is a little bit ruffled in, her serenity by the
census showing of . a decline in her manufacturing
industries, the value of whose product was 2 per cent
less in 1900 than it was in 1890. Moreover, the num
ber of wage" earners in manufacturing industries in
the city decreased from 78,000 to 72,000 during the
same decade. . .
Even the project of imperial federation received
little of his favor. He did not, indeed, deride it, but
he uttered a; warning -against .making haste to attain
it. "We cannot/ he said, "safely interfere with the
development of our relations to our daughter coun
tries. I look with apprehension on any attempt un
less backed up by a strong mass of public opinion to
anticipate events or foreclose precious results which,
if we are patient, are in store for" the empire." ri-:'.
Such a. statement will hardly be well received by
those sanguine colonial statesmen who have
seen in the imposition of taxes on the im
portation of â¢ grain into the kingdom a chance
for them to arrange a preferential tariff in
favor of colonial grain. 1 - Representatives of ; the
various colonies. are to be in London to attend
the coronation and a conference will then be held un
der the direction of Mr. Chamberlain for the purpose
of devising ways and means to bring the kingdom
and the colonies into closer relations. As the colo
nies have shown more desire for special privileges
in the British markets than for anything else, the
speech of the Prime Minister will dampen the ardor
of the delegates. -
In short, the success of the British arms in South

The Irish demand for home rule is treated by the
Premier even more curtly than the demand of the
Boers for a large measure of self-government. He
spoke of the various Irish demands: as ""insane, sui
cidal projects of imperial disruption." He did not
deign to give extended consideration to any of those
measures, and scoffed at the statesmen who advo
cate them. Â¦ . , "
For those who have hoped that a speedy peace
might be attained in South Africa and arrangements
made for allaying old antagonisms, the speech of the
Prime Minister is distinctly discouraging. He refers
to the uprising of the Boers as a "flagrant outrage
upon his Majesty's dominions." He declares the
Government will not recede one inch from its orig
inal demands, and said the country must not expect
'"the ashes of past conflicts to be extinguished im
mediately." v That is a hard saying, for it signifies
no intention of doing anything to restore peace on" an
enduring basis and sounds like an effort to prepare
the country for- a policy of repression in South Africa
that would mean something like the establishment
there of an absolÂ«te despotism.
It was noted that the tone and the manner of the
Premier were quite different from what they have
been for some years past. As the dispatches put it,
his address was "not pessimistic," as most of his late
speeches have been. Evidently he sees daylight
ahead in South Africa, and feels bold. He even went
so far as to say that had he been able to foresee, be
fore the outbreak of the war what would come of it,
he would still have pursued the same polky. In fact,
he seems to have been quite well satisfied with the
position of his Government. "We have suffered,"
he said, "but we have won."
LORD SALISBURY'S speech before the Prim
rose League holds out little promise to those
who have expected the British Ministry to act
with moderation and wisdom in dealing with the
problems of the empire. From first to last it was a
declaration of antagonism to every liberal sugges
tion. The Boers, the Irish, the aspiring "colonists
and the home reformers were alike_told that the Gov
ernment will concede nothing. Salisbury in fact
once more spoke for the stern and unbending Tories
of the kingdom and gave notice to his opponents
of every kind that he would grant peace upon no
terms other than unconditional surrender.

The recent rains over the great wheat belt have
.materially changed the national crop outlook for all
cereals. While they came too late to completely
restore the crop in ill sections, they have done so
much good that no more talk of short crops is heard
except in the Southwest. Seeding in the Northwest
â¢ has-been set beck by wet weather, but this ad
verse condition is not sufficiently serious to affect
the market.
Conditions in California continue flattering. With
us the business outlook is always largely a question
of crops of grain and fruit. The prospects for both
.are more than good, though the yield will hardly be
as enormous as anticipated a month ago, owing
largely to the cool spring. Hay is of good color,
but the staple will be shorter than expected, and
high water along the Sacramento River and dry
-weather in the southern bean districts have tended
to cut down the potato and bean output, and almost
all fruit sections are sending in reports of a dropping
of the yorng fruit, more or less serious. Pears and
prunes are suffering fiom an unknown blight, severe
in some districts and insignificant in others, and
-while no' scarcity in either is feared, the yield will not
break previous records, as was thought up to a few
days ago. All the other crops, as far as known, are
looking very well. The country merchants are send
ing in good reports, and the banks all over the State
are abundantly supplied with funds. Collections are
fully up to the average and failures are few. Build
ing operations are as brisk as ever, especially in San
Francisco, which is enjoying quite a boom in this
line, and Eastern people are coming to the State : n
large numbers. The outlook for the State could
hardly be more flattering, â¢
ii him 'B MnrfWinmillMinlll MiilMHi - ~ .
COMMERCIAL reports from all over the
country continue cheerful. They indicate
that the volume of distributive trade through
jobbing and retail channels is as large as at any time
curing the past three or four years of business activ
ity, with no signs of diminution. Manufacturing is
especially brisk, the only exception being in the
woolen trade, which is tied up at several centers by
strikes. This has caused a halt in the demand for
raw wool, and though the market is still firm the
buyers are now indifferent, and are no longer fall
ing over each other tc buy, and are no longer con
tracting for fleece while it is still on the sheep's back.
Prices, however, range higher than a year ago, but
the clip promises to be large. In iron and steel the
conditions are opposite those in wool, as buyers -who
have been expecting a lull in the trade, with a cor
responding break in prices, are now competing with
one another to secure tardy supplies, and this is re
ducing stocks of the raw material and pushing the dif
ferent mills to their full capacity to fill orders. Pro
visions are quoted firm at the great Western centers,
and the price of beef is so high along the Atlantic
Coast that the labor organizations are boycotting
the trust by signing pledges not to eat beef for thirty
days, and some of the State Governments are taking
the matter in hand through the courts. The railway
earnings, which are a good barometer of the condi
tion of general trade, continue to show an increase
over last j'ear, the gain in April being 10.6 per cent
over 1901 and 35 per cent over 1900. Prices of com
modities on May 1, according to Dun's index num
ber, were at the highest point of recent years, gain
ing 6.3 per cent over the same date last year, though
6ince May 1 a recession has been noticeable. The
bank clearings last week reached the enormous total
of $2,952,000,000, of which $2,073,000,000 is credited
to New York, the rest of the United Stakes making
an exhibit of $878,000,000. The failures for the week
were 218, against 187 for the same week last year.

of the law. But he has been saved, and the
course . of the law â¢ has been circumvented.
There are mighty few people in Tulare County
who have had any respect for Gage since he
has publicly demonstrated his smallness. And
now Tulare County cannot forgive him for his
gross misuse of . official power.
FRESNO MIRROR:
The Tulare Register says that from the tone
of the Democratic press one might infer that
about hair the Democrats in California wera
waiting for the opportunity to vote for Henry
T. Gage. Such an inference would be incor
rect. What the Democrats are waiting for ls
an opportunity to vote against Gage for Gov
ernor.
LOBI HERALI>:
When Dan Burns Issued his manifesto on his
return from Mexico, declaring with all auto
cratic importance that he had decided that the
Republican party again wanted Gage to be
its gubernatorial nominee, he displayed an as
sumption not astonishing but an arrogance
that is extremely offensive. - It3 first effect
was what Burns contemplated â the disconcert
ing of rival forces and the terrorizing of that
class of practical politicians who are always
on the scramble to get on the side of the win
ner. But the reaction has already set in. and
In earnest. The unorganized opposing forces â
the Republican voters, from whose ranks dele
gations will be formedâ will see Burns' great
bluff and go him several better.-
Dan Burns made a great mistake and the Re
publican State Convention ratified the blunder
when it nominated Estee in 1894. when there
was less, party opposition to him then than
there is and will be to Gage. The Governors
administration has earned too many aggressive
enemies and made too many indifferent friends
in his own party to make him a strong leader.
Left to its good sense and calm judgment
the next Republican convention could find un
erringly a score of distinguished gentlemen, in
any one of whom the great public conscience
would recognize a stronger and more accept
able candidate than Gage.
Can any one deny that Burns* purpose is to
cram Gage down the throat of the party? Al
ready he has inaugurated his game of "pure
politics" in San Francisco and it will not be
long before he attempts to stink thfi rural
parts to death with this same sort of fumiga
tion.
The kind of a man the great mass of Repub
licans want for their leader is one who can
UNIFY the party. Let him be a man who
can secure the nomination without intrigue
and squarely upon his merits and his political
strength. Such a nomination would be an
honor second only to a triumph at the polls.
The people still love to hug the delusion that
this is a government of the people, for the
people - and by the people.
PASADENA NEWS:
According to our humble opinion. Governor
Gage will surely be defeated in November, as
Estee was, if his nomination is forced by the
bosses and corporations. ,The Republican party
has too glorious a history to be dragged into
base uses.
Â«
REDLANDS CITROGBAPH:
The revolt against the boss domination of
Colonel Burns is widespread and deepseated.
In traveling over the State we find It every
where. Men have told us that they had noth
ing particular against Governor Gage, except
that he was controlled by Colonel Burns.
It is this widespread feeling that the wise
political leaders will take into account when
coolly calculating the chances of winning out
in the campaign this fall. Conceding the fact
that the State is 20,000 Republican, the change
of only a few votes in each precinct In the State
against the Republican nominee will change
the 20,000 majority into a 10,000 minority. The
feeling was noticeable in the Estee campaign â
and defeated one of the best men California
ever had. The feeling ls stronger to-day than
ir was then, and the same result will follow
If Governor Gage is renominated. Â¦ -
Victoria was accounted a thrifty sovereign in her
day, but it is said King Edward is more economical
still. He has put labor saving machinery into the
royal palaces, dismissed superfluous officials and ef
fected a saving of something like Â£25,000 a year by
his various economies^ The coronation will, of
course, require him to be liberal in his expenditure,
but after that it is believed he will settle down to
save money. , In fact, it would seem that since he
is too old to have a royal time of it he has decided
to be strictly business.

"Since the case of Fredrick is to be appealed to the
Supreme Court, it is to be hoped that tribunal will
give it a prompt hearing and bring the controversy
to a conclusion as speedily -as possible. An issue
of this kind that affects large public interests should
be entitled to right, of way on the calendar. The Jus
tices of the Supereme Court are to have much work
to do with the charter before it is licked into, shape
and the validity of its provisions definitely settled,
and consequently they, should be ready to take up
the work without delay and carry it forward as fast
as the test cases come to them.
It is probable that for a long time to come the
courts will be engaged in determining just what pow
ers the charter has legally conferred upon the various
officials of the municipal administration. Other
clauses than that reviewed by Judge Sloss in this
case will doubtless be found void when brought to
the. test of law, and the valid powers of the Mayor
be found -to be much less than is now claimed for
him. The community will suffer nothingby clipping
off some of the extravagant pretensions of the may
oralty office, for the elimination of 'them will be
nothing more than a return to that system of a divis
ion of governmental authority to which the Ameri
can people have been accustomed in every kind of
government from that of a municipality to that of
a nation..... _. ._.; . .. ._. ....-_ ..
This decision is . founded in reason as well as in
law. It maintains a doctrine which will receive the
approval of a large majority of the people It was
never the intention of the voters of San Francisco
to establish a Lord Mayor with something like uni
versal power of appointment and removal; and con
sequently it is gratifying that the extreme claims of
the Mayor in that direction are. refuted by the courts.
The decision of Judge Sloss is that the "provisions
of the charteV relating to the appointment of a Jus
tices', clerk are void." He also held that the conten
tion that the approval of the Mayor is necessary to
the election of a Justices' clerk is, unfounded. In
that connection he said: '"Acts which are not legis
lative in their character. need not be passed by or
dinance and shall not be subject to the veto power.
An election or appointment to -office is. not an ex
ercise, of legislative power, and therefore becomes
complete upon the passage of the resolution.^ ap
pointment. It is to be remembered that the veto
power is to be strictly construed and not extended
by application."
It is understood that an appeal is to be taken, to
the Supreme Court and it is of course advi/able that
it should be so. At the , time the charter was under
consideration The Call 'predicted .it would be found
defective in many ways, and the 'prediction has been
already amply fulfilled.; It is evident that there are
many . clauses of the instrument that are of doubtful
validity, and; the -.sooner .they are brought to the. test
of -the highest . court the better.
'â¢ t UDGE SLOSS in his decision in the contest for
' I the office of clerk- in ; the Justices' court has put
W limitation upon the. â¢powers claime'd by the
Mayor. He v has declared the claim of Powel Fred
rick to-be entirely -without .right and rtfs ordered
that possession be given to the contestant McComb.

HUMBOLDT STANDARD:
The Humboldt Citizen Is liable to ask some
questions which the leading Democratic paper
in this State will not readily answer. Here
is one which appears in its first number:
"We would like to know why the Examiner
did not give us a full report of the proceed
ings of the late meeting of the MonticelloClub
at San Francisco. This club, as its name in
dicates, is a Democratic organization and many
prominent Democrats are members and were
ptes'ent at- the meeting, and many fine speeches
were made. The Call and other prominent
Republican papers gave the proceedings a fair
notice, with a brief synopsis of what was said
and done. The Examiner claims to be a Demo
cratic paper, and its patrons and readers are
mostly Democrats. Yet it did not say one
word about the meeting. The Democrats here
say: 'Why. is this?' "
Simply because the Examiner is a Hearst
ling which is Democratic when it chooses to
be, or when the proprietor can dictate. In its
rul'j-or ruin policy it determines not to give
-publicity to anything certain Democrats may
do because it cannot control them. It fought
Stephen M. White with- virulence and men
dacity because White was too great a man to
bow to the decrees of Willie Hearst. It re
'fuses to publish the proceedings of the Mon
ticello Club, because that club contains men
of independence and character who will not
bend the knee to Hearst. Gavin McNab and
other Democrats, whose shoe-lachets the Ex
aminer is not worthy to unloose, despise the
Examiner and will not be driven to do Its
behests, hence the newspaper which claims to
publish all the news prints yellow rot and
leaves the Republican "papers of San Francisco
to report the proceedings of such a notable
gathering of able. and influential Democrats as
the Montlcello Club.- Such is the Democracy
of the Hearstlings. ,\
Â¦ ... . . .
IT is evident from the tone of the Republican press and the comment of leading public men of the State that
Henry T. Gage's chances for renomination for Governor have gone glimmering. The elation in the Democratic
camp has also died out. Early in the campaign Democratic statesmen were led to believe that the Burns-Herrin ma
chine would be strong enough to control the Republican State' convention and place Gage at the head of the ticket
There was an immediate rush of Democratic aspirants for gubernatorial honors because it was generally recognized
that Gage would be an easy mark for the opposition. Subsequent events have convinced the Democratic leaders that
the Republican convention cannot be programmed to nominate the machine candidate. It is now generally under
stood in all the camps that Gage is practically out of the race for renomination. The machine possesses some
transferrable strength, but to whom it will be given is a matter of conjecture in political circles. As the comments of
the leading newspapers of the State are readable The Call presents another collection, as follows:
NILES HERALD:
The Republican press of the State from
north to south is almost unanimous in the
belief that the renomination of Governor Gage
for a second term would be unwise and could
result only in the defeat of the Republican
ticket. The Democratic papers, strange as it
may 'seem, are in favor of his renomination.
It can be surmised that the opposition believes
ho would be the easiest candidate to defeat this
fall.
The Republican party owes it to itself and
the people of the State to throw off every thing
wh.ch could be construed to favor the basses
or their desires. If success is expected at the
polls the people must be allowed to have free
dom in selecting the ticket and only men who
are free from boss influences nominated.
If this ls done Governor Gage will be retired
and with a strong man at the head of the
ticket the Republicans will carry the State by
a majority equal to that of two years ago.
SAN DIEGO TRIBUNE:
There is nothing more evident in State poli
tics at the present time than that the best
element of the Republican party, which stood
so stanchly by Governor Gage is his battle
for election in 1898. has become so disgusted
with the manner in which he has turned over
the administration of State affairs to the gang
that runs the "machine" that his renoraina
tion for the office would result in the defeat
of the party in the coming election. It is
openly asserted that- such a renomination
would. result in party division. Whether or not
the "machine" will, by its cappers, be able
by hypnotic methods to foist him upon the
party in the coming campaign, depends upon
unity of action by those who desire clean poli
tics . sufficiently to administer the rebuke his
administration of public' affairs merits.
No effort is being spared by Gage and his
tools to secure his indorsement for another
term. The danger to the party is that unre
mitting work on the part of the gang for its
own political existence may score a victory
ovei- the decent element among Republicans
solely by reason of .the latter's failure to- see
the fact, that the machine is strong enough
to control the situation unless active and com
bined effort is made to block the game. There
can be no uncertainty in the ground rumble
that has followed the opening of the Gage cam
paignâits meaning is definite. The better
class of papers throughout the State are re
flecting popular opinion in their denunciation
of the regime that has become nauseous.
Governor Gage is determined to saddle him
self and his gang upon the public for another
term. His hope of winning as the exponent of
Republican principles has been abandoned and
he has. nought alliance' with the Democrats
and the straggling elements, depending upon
the "practical politics" of his spoilsmen to
foist him upon the nominating convention and
his unholy entanglements *to carry victory at
the polls. He is so manifestly using the
power of his office to secure his renomination
that he has disgusted even his former most
ardent supporters.
There has been talk of having the county
committees appoint the delegates to the nom
inating convention from those counties where
the primary laws are not in force. The State
Central Committee has put itself on record as
opposing this. Should" the Gage combination
succeed in overriding the recommendation of
the State Central Committee and get control
of the Convention, the voters will administer
a rebuke at the polls that will mean the de
feat of the State ticket.
In addition to the general feeling of repug
nance to the administration methods of Gov
ernor Gage, there is a feeling of resentment
In the southern end of the State because of
the petty spite which actuated him in his veto
of the appropriation made by the Legislature
for the- completion of the San Diego State Nor
mal School. The present unfinished condition
of this institution, which has reached the limit
of its growth until further appropriation shall
be made, is a monument not to the spirit of
"economy" 'upon which Gage's adherents seek
to dwell, but to a spirit of malice.- Such
"economy" does not commend itself to the
friends of public education.
POMONA TIMES:
The Sacramento Leader favors E. B. Edson
of Siskiyou for Governor, and says in this
connection :
"With the present temper of the Republi
cans the renomination of Governor Gage would
be suicidal. â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢Â¦ in the face of known
conditions Republicans must /Concentrate on
a candidate other than Mr. Gage or else be
up against certain defeat.'* Â« 'Â¦Â¦Â¦
With the exception of France our own Govern
ment is the only one that has taken any step toward
the relief of the sufferers. In that fact there is
nothing surprising. We have long led the world in
the works of humanity and of charity. Great Britain
and Russia and China have had occasion to be grate
ful to us for help given to their famine-stricken sub
jects. What we will do in this case, therefore,~is
nothing new on our part. We are not only the rich
est but the most liberal and most humane 'of the
nations, and the banner of the Stars and Stripes has
been hailed with joy by more of the stricken people
than any other flag that ever floated beneath the sky.
The prompt action of France was, of course, due
to the fact that Martinique .is a French island and
thousands of its inhabitants have kinsmen in France.
The French Colonial Office has been authorized by
the Cabinet to expend'all the money required to suc
cor the sufferers, and' a commissioner at once
steamed from Brest for the scene of the calamity.
He carries with him m'oney and supplies and will be
followed, of course, by further supplies at once.
France is as yet the only government; .that
has acted, but the Congress of the United
States would have acted on Saturday had it
not .been that a relief bill passed by; the Sen
ate was delayed in the House of Representatives
by the action of one man, Underwood of Alabama,
who objected to taking it up on that day. There can
be little doubt that it will be passed to-day and that
as speedily as possible aid will be sent to the' stricken
people of the devastated island. In fact, the Presi
dent has not waited for Congress to act, but has al
ready ordered the cruiser Cincinnati to proceed to
the island and investigate the extent of the disaster
The greater portion of the relief will, of course',
come from private contributions. In fact, The Call,
in connection with the New York Herald' and other
allied papers, has already arranged to send relief.
A ship has been chartered for the work and is. now
at sea with orders to touch at San Juan, and Porto
Rico. Contributions to this relief fund will be trans
mitted by cable to San Juan, where the money will
be expended for the needed' supplies and at once
hurried forward ' on the chartered steamer to the
stricken island. ' ....
OVER the desolation of Martinique charity has
at once spread its wings, and swift ships car
rying supplies will soon convey to the sur
vivors of the disaster every help that human hands
can give. We are thus to have another illustration
of how greatly and grandly the sentiment of human
ity has developed in our time, and how prompt men
are becoming to relieve the distress of their fellow
men in every part of the globe. Â¦, . ,_; â¢

BAXER&FIELD CALIFORNIA!*
(DEMOCRATIC):
with Eugene E. Schmitz in the field as a
candidate for the Republican nomination for
Governor, even Gage will have to look to his
laurels. If the Mayor goes into the fight with
the backing of the labor element, which htÂ»
undoubtedly will have, he will prove a danger
ous antagonist.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mayor Schmitz is becoming an astute poli
tician. He has an ambition to be Governor,
and he realizes that he can only accomplish thin
through the Republican party, of which he has
been a life-long member. It is not surpris
ing, therefore, that he should desire to make
his peace with that organization, nor that he
should, address a gathering of Republicans ad
his fellows.
Up to this time the Examiner has modestly
gathered in the credit of electing Schmitz; as
a matter of fact it did nothing of the kind.
In a leading editorial it advised the voters
of San Francisco to cast their ballots for
Tobin and at the same time It averred that
Schmits would be the creature of Abe Ruet
if he were elected. After the vote was count
ed it modestly reprinted extracts from fawn
ing interior papers which gave to the Exam
iner the credit of having achieved a great
political victory in the metropolis. But the
Mayor knows better, and he is apparently not
consulting that paper as to his political course
or as to how the city of San Francisco shall
be governed. He is, when all is said, a pretty
big man, and an independent one, and being
the latter, if he does not soon have the Exam
iner at his heels all signs fall.

Is made a little like a billiard table, only
having exact ping-pong dimensions and
covered with red felt. The crowning fea
ture Is the rim of wood, two Inches high,
which keeps the balls from rolling off so
easily. Of course, they bound off repeat
edly, so the players are sure of sufficient
exercise without any unnecessary scram
bling about the floor after balls.
I will venture to say that Mrs. John F.
Merrill had less arguing to do than any
woman at the convention in Los Angeles
last week. Of course, she represented the
Century and Alden clubs most conscien
tiously, but aggressive methods are not aT
part of her policy, yet she certainly gets
favorable results. One observes that
while Mrs. Merrill Is prominently identi
fied with club work 3he never forgets
that her husband and children come first,
and that the same harmony pervades her
home that attends her work outside. Her
children have inherited their mother's
beauty, and are so charmingly trained
that any one might well be proud of
them. Then, too, Mrs. Merrill belongs to
the clubs that do loving and philan
thropic work. I believe she is a director
in one of the hospitals, an associate mem
ber of the Alden Club and of the Interna
tional Sunshine Society (of which the
Alden Is a branch), and honorary presi
dent of the Little Marguerites, as well aÂ«s
the Chrysanthemum Auxiliary, both of
which support a bed in the Children's
Hospital the year round. Gladys Merrill
la an active member of the Chrysanthe
mums, while Ruth works for the\Margu-Â°
rltes, so you see their mother is includ
ing club life in their bringing up. Surely
men would not rail at club women if they
were all like Mrs. Merrill. â¢ .

Everybody Is glad to have Miss Pearl
Sabin back again. She returned last week
from a prolonged stay in Chicago with
her family. The Sabins were delightfully
situated at the Auditorium Hotel in that
city, where they have many strong
friends. Miss Sabin Is one of" those
charming girls that no end of attention
could spoil. She Is always sweet, sympa
thetic and lovable. It Is needless to say
that no social function yet to be given
would be complete without her.
Is rarely seen/and her figure Is charming.
Mr. and Mrs. Bonnet made a very short
wedding trip owing to business interests,
and they are therefore taking little trips
to near resorts of interest every Saturday
to Monday. This week they were at Hotel
Mateo.

To-night begins the sixth week of the
great success, "Fiddle Dee Dee," at
Fischer's Theater, and preparations are
going on for the record run of a hundred
nights of this very funny burlesque. New
specialties will again be added to-night,
and next week there will be two new
artists added to the excellent cast at this
house. There Is already a big demand for
seats for the second of the Weber &
Feld's plays.
The pJece has made a distinct hit. Annie
Myers in the title role, now her initial
nervousness has worn off, is singing with
all her customary vim and voice. Edward
Webb, who makes a delightful team with
the Tivoli soubrette, is excellent as ths
singing girl's brother, and Ferris Hart
man as Prince Pumpernickel, though not
cast to best advantage, gives an exceed
ing clever sketch of the old man. The
ensembles are excellent, the costuming
smart to a degree and the rest of the cast,
as usual, highly effective.
McCormicfc got them to return with-fcim
to the Morgue and they shook the body,
when a perceptible sound, resembling a
long drawn out groan came from the
corpse. Fennel nlaced his hand over the
dead man's heart and found that it was
not cold, although there was no pulsa
tion. Later a mirror was placed over the
mouth, but there was no sign of respira
tion. The conclusion T/as thereupon
reached that the man was really dead,
but no one could account for the groans.
The body remained for some hours -with
out turning colcl.
Corran was a former soldier, about 35
years Of age, and arrived from Manila,
about two wee"ks ago on the transport
Grant. He registered at the International
Hotel on May 1, and started in to drink
extensively. Late Saturday night he be
came ill and Dr. Elliott yras called in.
He found that the man was suffering from
delirium trements and ordered his re
moval to the Emergency hospital. Shortly
before noon yesterday Steward Egbert re
ported to Dr. Bunnell that Corran ' was
dead and the Morgue officials were noti
fied.
They conveyed the body Of Hugh Cor
ran from the Emergency hospital, and
as they were carrying It from the "re
ceiver" to place it on a slab in the Morgue
Fennel said to Murphy, "What are you
grunting at?" and Murphy retorted. "I'm
not grunting; it's evidently that fellow,"
indicating the corpse. They looked into
each -other's faces, dropped the body and
ran upstairs to notify Chief Deputy Mc-
Cormick. They were as pale as ghosts.
Deputy Coroner Jacob Fennel and Mes
senger James Murphy were scared out
of their wits yesterday afternoon.

Play Is Cleverly Given
Before Big Audience
at California.
- "The Eingln? Girl" begins its ' second
week at the Tivoli to-night, with every
prospect <Jf continued excellent business.
"The Wor'd." a spectacular melodrama,
r/IIl fce the Central Theater's bill this
week. "The World" is one of the kind
of shows upon which thÂ» Central spreads
Itsoir, and will be put on with the/utmost
elaborateness of scenic effects. Many
electrical and mechanical wonders are
promised, and the dmraa provides oppor
tunity for all sorts of p-cenlc splendors.
The plot is of the usual Central sort, with
expkiEiors at sea, insane asylums and the
river r J"hanies fcr local color, and the
Â«tory concerns it?r-lf with a disinherited
ecri. his elQer brother, heir to the f amtl /
tftlMSons, and the fight of the disinherited
to obtain possession cf the millions.
Rural drama gives place to farce com
edy at the Alcazar Theater i this week,
with "Lost 24 Hours" for the bill. The
play is bright and affords many laughter
producing situs.Uor.E, in which the clever,
company shou'd be *een to much advan
tage "The ErJxton Burglary." one of
the funniest of modern farces, and with
a complex of seaj=rÂ»ns' honorable record in
London and the Cast, will follow. It w!ll
bÂ« one of the events of the Alcazar sea
son.
The Grand Opera-house will have
"ReilJy and the 4W," another sterling
comedy by Edward Harrigan, as bill this
week. The Harrigan engagement is prov
ing a most successful one, and any one
desirous of seeing the older comedian and
older comedy at their best should see
Harrigan in one of his own plays. "Reiliy
and the 400" is a title that happily sug
gests the contents of the play, and Mr.
Harrigan has a character therein that is
one cf his most taking creations. The
support rendered by the house company
will be amply effective and the staging
sufficient and handsome.
To-night at the Columbia Theater the
distinguished actor, John Drew, begins a
two weeks' engagement with "The Second
in Command," the latest effort from the
clever pen of Robert Marshall, author of
"A Royal Family." In the play Mr. Drew
has a part that is said to suit him ad
mirably, that of Major Kit Bingham, who
is "second in command," in love, in war,
in all the various successes that make life
worth living. The famous player will be
well supported, his leading lady. Miss Ida
Conquest, being among the most favored
stage liphts with local audiences. The
play will be staged with the usual hand
someness of the Frohman productions.
Mile. Chester's $10,000 statue dog proved
a marvel of canine cleverness. The dog,
which Is snow white in color, appears
with its mistress in a series of novel btat
ues. It is one of the best acts that has
been seen here in years. Lew Sully, the
popular story teller and parody singer,
kept the patrons of the show laughing
the entire fifteen minutes he held the
boards. The Florenz troupe of wonder
ful acrobats did some amazingly clever
tumbling.
Raymond and Caverly, German come
dians, were exceptionally good. Miss
Julia Heinrich, the proud possessor of
one of the most beautiful contralto
voices ever heard in this city, made her
final appearance on the vaudeville stage.
Miss Heinrich leaves for Europe very
shortly. She rendered "A Summer
Night," "Send Me a Lover, St. Valen
tine," and "Oh, That We Two Were May
ing," in a manner that moved the big
audience to merited applause.
The bill presented at the Orpheum this
week is exceptionally good. The hold
over performers appeared in brand-new
skits, sketches aca novelty turns, which
licigtiiened their popularity. Hilda Thomas
ar.d her partner, ixm Hall, rendered a
highly pleasing musical comedietta,
wnich was fairly studded with laughs
and clever work. In this amusing sketch
Miss Thomas' versatility is given a wide
sway.
James F. Kelly and Dorothy Kent ap
peared in their musical farce entitled
"Ginger Snaps." Their work was out of
the ordinary, and they recorded a hit.
Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Kelcy essayed what
was termed a "bright travesty," entitled
"... Trial Performance"; but neither the
lines nor . the situations were amusing
enough to show the ability of the clever
team.
riank Mac Vicars was another among

Mr. Neill had the role of Jefferson
Stockton, the Californian millionaire, who
comes to grief through his adventure into
the English aristocracy, and did some
good work in the part, though it is not
by any means his happiest role. As the
aristocraxic scamp. Prince von Halden
v.-aid, Clifford Dempsey does some ad
mirable work. He lias manner, poise and
a good deal of temperament, and his
scenes with Miss Chapman (Mrs. Stock
ton) and her injured husband had both

A good house greeted the Neill Com
pany last night at the California The
ater in Bronson Howard's comedy "Aris
tocracy," and gave a well-earned meed
of applause to its good acting. The play
Is a trifle antiquated in atmosphere, the
atric and unreal, but it has its moments.
The strong third act redeems it, and, as
it was done last night, was invested with
both truth and power. The casting of
the play throughout was unusually for
tunate, and was conspicuous for two or
three exceptionally good impersonations.
The first excursion of representative business
men of San Francisco to the San Joaquin Val
ley has accomplished much to bring . about a
closer relationship .between the metropolis and
the interior. The party made seven stops en
route and on every side was greeted most cor
dially and royally entertained. Many, in fact
the majority of the excursionists, had never
before visited this wonderful valley, and espe
c\ally under such favorable conditions. Drives
were taken Into the country and the genial
hosts took especial pains to point out the re
sources of their several localities. Grand are
these resources, the opportunities for profit
able Investment being everywhere apparent
When the world at large has been informed of
what the San Joaquin Valley has to offer th*
people necessary to its proper development win
flock to this garden spot by thousands. The
California promotion committee has undertaken
the proper advertising of this State, with the
co-operation of the Interior, which such excur
sions aid so much in bringing about. The
California promotion committee will arrange
other excursions in the near future. to differ- !
ent parts of the State, as it has been practi
cally demonstrated that they are in the right '
direction.
Walter M. Castle of the promotion com
mittee said: .w
In my opinion the benefits ' to be. derived
from the San Francisco business nfen's ex- '
cursion to the San .Toaquin Valley pities can-' ;
not be overestimated. The exchange; of cour
Â¦ tesies between the members of the mercantile I
organizations of San Francisco and the, Boards
of Trade and by business men of the valley,
the exchange of business views and the at
tentive consideration of th* requirements of
our friends and next door merchants eloquently |
pointed out to us through the able arguments I
of their orators, cannot fall to produce unquall- !
fledly good results. Aside from all this the fact t
remains thnt San Francisco has shown by.tho I
action of her representative business men a |
spirit of open-handed and i full-hearted sym- ;
pathy with and for, these upbullders of our
magnificent San Joaquin Valley that cannot i
be suitably expressed in words. '
Among other classes of business men
the same sentiments" were expressed.'
PROMOTION COMMITTEE,
âufus, P. Jennings of the promotion
committee said:
Manager Filcher of the State Board of
Trade said:
The business men's excursion to Bakersfleld
and the upper San Joaquin Valley, under the
auspices of the different commercial organiza
tions of San Francisco, was a success. It
was pleasurable, profitable and educational.
Besides affording the opportunity for an out
ing and relaxation under the most favorable
conditions for men who are usually confined
and burdened with responsibilities it gave
those same men a chance to meet many of
their interior patrons face to face and exchange
friendly greetings, and what la more Impor
tant U gave the business men of the metropolis
of the State a chance to see and learn more
of the State's great resources and possibilities.
Those who went on this excursion and saw
the oil fields of Kern, the orange groves and
prune orchards of Tulare, the rich and varied
resources of Kings, the great raisin vineyards
of Fresno, the wine and orchard and raisin in
dustries of Madera, returned with increased
faith and pride in California, because more
profoundly impressed with its prodigal rich
ness and wonderful possibilities. Their confi
dence in the State of their home could nol
help but be Increased by the scenes of pro
ductiveness that greeted them on every hand.
Confidence inspires enterprise, enterprise be
gets Investment, Investment puts money in cir
culation, leads to the development of latent
resources, gives stimulus to all kinds of busi
ness and makes better timeB for everybody
Such excursions are good things because they
afford the men of business a chance to know
the country on which their business feeds and
I am sure the better San Francisco business
men know California the mo-re confidence they
â¢will have in their city and their , own Invest-
I ments.
EXCURSION A SUCCESS.
Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, said:
Our excursion has been a remarkable suc
cess and will do a great deal toward cement-
Ing ties of friendship between the country and
the city. Everywhere we received ovations.
The people we visited were heartily glad to
see .us. The only regret expressed was that
our stay was too short and we had to prom
ise to come again and stay longer. The visit
to the country was a revelation to many of
cur party who had not visited the San Joa
quin Valley, and had no idea of its immense
and diversified resources. Millions of dollars
could profitably be invested and thousands of
laborers be employed In developing the indus
tries of the country visited. The people of
Bakersfleld, Portervllle, Vlsalia, Tulare, Han
ford and Fresno view with pleasure the move
ment initiated by the business men of San
Francisco to promote the industry and popu
late the country and will co-operate with us
in the movement. They all believe they live
in the best part of the State, but all are willing
to work lor prosperity of a Greater California.
The benefits that arise from having the
San Franciscans personally acquainted
with the people and the several localities
In the interior having been made manifest
by the San Joaquin Valley trip, the idea
was entertained readily that the same at
tention- that has been paid to one section
of the State was due to others. At the
same meeting it was voted to send to the
communities that entertained* the visitors
on their trip through the San Joaquin
Valley the thanks of the visitors. Lead
ing members of the business men's party
were' interviewed concerning the San Joa
quin excursion.
REPRESENTATIVE MEN SPEAK.
President F. J. Symmes of the Mer
chants' Association said:
Tne merchants' excursion to the San Joa
quin Valley is completed and may be pro
nounced a irasrniflcent success. Never before
has such a body gone forth from San Fran-
I clsco on euch a. mission. The object was en
tirely an unselfish one. It has been profound
ly impressed upon us that the State fe greater
than the city and that the' nobler object of
working for others and building up the Inte
rior is sure to bring -a little later prosperity
directly to o'-r own doors. It was a. pleasant
mission to ko forth to the Interior of the
State and say to the citizens of various cities
and towns that we have twenty-ttve hundred
dollars a month which we intend to devote to
makinjr known to the world the advantages
of California, regardless of. sectional interests.
It was net known that we went out to otter
any such advantages to the interior and yet
our receDtlon Â«t every point was most cordial
ami sincere. Good men and fair women greet
ed us with fruit and with flowers and with
kind words till we almost felt that we must be
some Eastern or foreign delegation to a Chris
tian conference or a woman's convention. We
learned another lesson, also, that such a jour
ney of the merchants of our city has another
value beyond the stimulation which we feel
was riven to those with whom we came In
contact. We learned to know and enjoy each
other better and made it easier to do another
good and unselfish deed in future.
Vice President Charles Bundschu of the
Merchants' Association said:
The merchants' excursion through the San
Joaquin Valley, Including the carnival at Ba
kersfleld, is an incident to be long remem
bered by all who availed themselves of the
opportunity afforded. With the various im
prossions of the Immense natural resources
and development of this central district of
California, with its good cheer and good fel
lowship, this first exDeriment of a united ef
fort In the direction of practical promotion
must be pronounced an unqualified success. A
congenial body of wide-awake business men
was finally Induced to join the excursion and
the majority considered It a sort of personal
sacrifice or individual concession. But they
received in return more than they had antici
pated. The kind and heartfelt appreciation
of the people we met wherever a short i stop
could be made: the desire that was expressed
in many ways to assist in the promotion of
common interests forcefully reminded the mer
chants of San Francisco that the metropolis
must take U;e lead In establishing friendly
relations between the city and the country.
We tender to all who befriended us ! on our
trip our sincere recognition for the instruction
i and gratification we experienced and enjoyed.
The San Francisco business men who
toured the San Joaquin Valley last week
decided on the homeward journey that a
similar compliment was due to the Sac
ramento Valley. A meeting was called
in one of the cars while the business men
were speeding through Contra Costa
County, at which President F. J. Symmes
of the Merchants' Association presided.
No date was fixed for the tour through
the Sacramento Valley, nor were any de
tails arranged, the proposition being then
entertained for the first time.
Colonel Pippy perceived that an infor
mal reception at the rooms of the league
wouhi be more agreeable to the Gov
ernor than a formal banquet,^ hence the
receptive function was slated. Colonel
Pippy names Wednesday evening at 8:30
o'clock. Every member of the club will
be permitted to invite two guests. The
night is not to be filled with oratory.
There will be but two speeches. Colonel
Pippy will welcome the Governor to the
league and the latter will respond to the
greeting. Introductions will follow and
conversation ensue. ,-j-
It is understood that Governor Gage,
Mayor Schmitz and several others will
be specially invited to attend the recep
tion and meet the Governor of the Empire
State. Colonel E. F. Preston. , Senator
Thomas Flint, E. B. Edson, Dr. Pardee
and Senator W. M. Cutter, well-known
Republican aspirants for the honor of
serving California in the executive chair,
are all members of the league and entÂ«
tied by right of membership to join in the
greeting. Moreover each one may invite
two of his moat ardent supporters to
attend the function. An informal meet
ing, where one may smoke and talk and
, listen, is Governor Odell's notion of a re
ception, and the club will endeavor to
meet his views.
Governor Odell and party wentto San
Mateo yesterday and remained there for
the night. The Governor will return to
San Francisco this morning.
Governor Odell of New York and Colo
nel George H. Pippy, president of the
Union League, met at the Palace Hotel
yesterday and talked of Innings and out
ings. The Governor announced that he
would leave San Francisco next Thurs
day. He said he would attend E. H. Har
riman's dinner at the Paciilc Union Club
to-night, and indicated that his time Tues
day or Wednesday evening was^at the
call of the Union League Club.

The rest cf the programme was con
tributed by Miss Lillie Levey and Laura
Spiro. At the close of the entertainment
dancing was enjoyed until a late hour.
Miss Celia Celler, a very popular ama
teur, scored a big hit with her songs and
sketches. She gave evidence of being
possessed of talent, and with proper de
velopment she will be able to enter the
professional ranks as a vaudeville artist.
Her parents are opposed to such a course,
but friends are trying to overcome their
objections. The young lady may soon
make her debut.
The entertainment opened with an over

GARDEN CITY WHEELMEN WIN HUNDRED-MILE RELAY RACE FOR THIRD SUCCESSIVE YEAR
Bluer ocks galore were shattered at
the Ingleside bluerock traps yesterday
in the regular monthly Inanimate target
shoot of the Golden Gate Gun Club.
In the shoot-off of last month's tie be
tween Otto Feudner and C. A. Halght
for the Olympic Gun Club cup Feudner
succeeded in winning by a, score of 43
out of a possible 50. Of his first twenty
flve birds he lost five, and out of hia
second twenty-five he allowed but threa
to remain unbroken. Haight did not
shoot ud to his usual good form. In his
first twenty-five birds he got but eight
een, and in his last twenty-five ha
missed twelve.
Probably the most Interesting event
of the aay was the race for an
other of the Olympic Gun Club's
cups, open only to former mem
bers of the club. The contestants
were handicapped according to their mer
its, and each shot at fifty birds. Neu
stadter and Derby stood at the sixteen
yard mark, Is'auman at the twenty-yard
mark and Haight at the eighteen-yard,
mark. All made 44, and were therefore
tied for the trophy. In the shoot-off
Neustadter won with a score of 23.
In the handicap event Golcher, Nau
man and M. O. Feudner won silver bars.
In the club shoot, which was a twenty
five bird race, the contestants were han
dicapped. The handicaps and the scores
made were as follows:
Twenty-yard handicaps â Fred Feudner 18,
Sweeney 10. Otto Feudner 22, Nauman I*.
Elichteen-yard handicaps â Murdock 19, Slada
20 Edgar Forster 20. Wands 17, Otto Feudner
20, Haight 22, Robinson 19.
Sixteen-yard handicaps â Neustadter 19.
Golcher 2i; Wattles 10. Derby M, McConnell 20.
Fourteen-yard handicapâ GerstlÂ« 17.

yards 34; O. Feudner. 20 yards, 43; Tano, 18
yards. 30; Derby. 1Â« yards. 44.
In the following thirty-bird handicap race all
the entries shot at their first fifteen birds from
the sixteen-yard mark, and for the second fif
teen they were handicapped according to the
first scores.
Scores made for the sixteen-yard -mark were :
Golcher 14. Xauman 13, F. Feudner 13. Neu
stadter 13. Wands 13, O. Feudner 12. Tano 12.

18 yards, 15; Fred Feudner. 18 yards. 13; Nen
stadter, 18 yards, 10; Wanda. 13 yards, 10;
The fast sloop Harpoon will defend the
Ptrpetual Challenge cup in the race
against' the San Francisco Yacht Club'3
Challenger. Yesterday's trial of speed
between Harpoon and Presto settled that.
Harpoon beating Frank Stone's sloop by
7:01 minutes, corrected time, over the
Corinthian course, estimated at fourteen
miles. The two boats were sent across
the line to an excellent start at 12:30 p.
m., and at the Presidio sboal buoy Har
poon had gained five and a half minutes,
rounding it -at 1:10:45, while Presto did
not round it till 1:16:15. Both boats made
short tacks out to the buoy, but Frank
Stone lost at least two or three minutes,
as he did not succeed in rounding the
mark till his third attempt. He had reck
oned on the wind hauling somewhat after
the Fulton Iron Works were passed, but
as this did not happen he lost ground.
Blossom Rock buoy was rounded by Har
poon at 1:26 and by Presto at 1:32, show
ing-Harpoon to hav^ gained six minutes
actual time since the start. The leeward
stakeboat at Southampton shoal was
rounded by Harpoon at 1:43:30 and by
Presto at 1:51, Harpoon being seven and a
half minutes in the lead. As Presto's
time allowance was only 6 minutes 50 sec
onds, the race, barring accidents, was al
ready won by Harpoon. The winner
rounded Presidio shoal buoy for the sec
ond time at 2:54, and Presto rounded It at
3:06. Harpoon finished at 3:09:13, and Pres
to crossed the finishing line off Meiggs
wharf at 3:23:04. Harpoon thus beat Pres
tol3 minutes 51 seconds, actual time, or 7
minutes 1 second corrected time. -
Presto was sailed by Frank . Stone, the
members of his crew being Douglas Ers
kine, J. H. Hopps, George Harrold, L.
McLean and F. E. Schober. Harpoon was
sailed by Fred Russ Cook, â¢ the members
of the crew being -W. H. Toepke, J. H.
Sharpe, Frank Simmen, Fred Myers and
H. T. Frost. There was a fair breeze,
which llghtned somewhat toward the end
of the race, a smooth sea and a full tide.
Harpoon's steering gear met with a mis
hap during the race, but it was soon put
right and caused little loss of time. Har
poon carried a new staysail and main
sail, the latter presented by the Corin
thian Yacht Club. .
The race was watched by a large part
of the Corinthian fleet. The Challenger
was also out in the channel and had a
brush with several of the Corinthian
fleet, it being reported that she was
passed by the sloops Emma, Aeolus and
others.

The race yesterday was conceded to be
between the Garden City Wheelmen and
the Bay City Wheelmen. George Wyman.
representing the latter club on the first
ten-mile reiay, had a tempestuous jour
ney. He ran into a rut soon after the
start, falling and injuring his bicycle. He
hurriedly put it in order, but near the end
of the relay the chain slipped off and he
was again thrown. He lost a minute and
a half at this vital stage of the race.
Carl Limberg of the Garden City Wheel
men landed in San Jose two minutes
ahead of Frank Pearne of the Bay Cities.
The San Jose men gained steadily up to
the eighth relay, where they were five
minutes ahead. J. Hobson of the Bay

SACRAMENTO, May 11.â The game be
tween the Senators and Ponies to-day was
a hard-fought contest, the score standing
1 to 1 up to the beginning of the thir
teenth inning, when over-anxiousness on
the part of the Sacramentos to win the
game resulted in a bunch of errors that
allowed three of the Ponies to cross the
plate and the game was over. Thomas
pitched thirteen innings of superb ball, al
lowing but seven scattered hits, and it was
through no fault of his that the game
went abroad. Meredith stayed in the
game for seven innings and then retired
in favor of Whalen. Score:

Cycler Cramer's Remarkable Mile.
The game at Recreation Park was a
wonder. It was the greatest game in the
history of the present league and 8000 peo
ple who revel in the sound of the merry
base hit adorned the stands and bleachers
and lined up against the fences to pass out
a few bundles of shouts for, the favorites.
Everything that goes to make baseball
worth seeing was scattered among those
nine fierce innings. Double plays, home
runs, fast fielding, glaring "errors and ex
citing base running, were exploded ! at
short intervals, and all combined had the
immense crowd verging on the hysteria
stage. ...
Buck Francks, whom everybody knows
and everybody likes, was the main guy of
the performance. He walloped the ball
over the fence on two occasions, and' did
the swellest- kind of -work at short.
Though he made two- homers, Francks Is
credited with but one in the score.-, The
last was . made at the end of the game
when Dunlevy was on' : first.' When
Dun. scored the' game was over; and
Francks' four-cushion swipe counted for
naught. However, the fans will remem
ber, that he did the turn. and will not for
get him the next time he. toed the scratch.
The Angels made their two in the initial
round. Toman benefited by Cristall's gen
erosity and walked to first. Raymer
forced him at second and Householder
drove one to Mohler, who threw badly to
Francks and . both runners were safe.
Reilly drove a stiff, single, out to center
field and Walters let it pass him. Great
excitement prevaled when Raymer - and'
Householder ambled home, but Reilly was
caught at the plate in the mixup.
Oakland did its first run-getting stunt in
the third in a. peculiar maze of mixups
'and mishaps and unaided by a single safe
hit. Francks got a Â¦ chance on Toman's
error. Gorton bunted and reached first on
Jones' misplay. Cristall -hit to Jones;. who
threw to catch Francks at. third.' There
was a general bustle in trying to catch
the wily 'Buck, who finally escaped and
reached the plate in safety. Gorton, how
ever, was out, for both he and Francks
touched the third sack at the same time,
and somebody had to suffer, so it I was up
to Gorton to bear. .the loss. :
Â¦Both pitchers did magnificent work.- No
Both contests went to Ewijig fairly and
squarely. Not a bit too fairly in the
afternoon, for he was bunkoed out of
one run by a close decision at the plate.
Jack O'Connell is human, just like every
umpire, and those who saw the play for
gave him when Oakland won out because
they were the better horses. The score in
the morning was 7 to 4 and in the after
noon 3 to 2.
Cal Ewing and nothing but cha
grin and remorse to one Morley. The ban
ner of mighty Oakland waved on high and
also on the low down, while the would-be
champs from the sunny south looked like
a lot of foolish youths who tried to rush
a bargain counter.
THE 'beautiful summer weather
which invaded both the Oakland
grounds and Recreation Park
yesterday brought happiness to J.
The annual tournament for the cham
pionship of Northern California will be
played at Sacramento, commencing to
morrow. The final matches will be played
on Friday. The entry list is already the

singles, men's doubles and women's
doubles. All the towns of the northern

mento, Woodland and Penryn.

The park courts are more popular than
ever, and many players were unable to
get a court to play on yesterday. At
present there are ten courts, but twice
that number would hardly accommodate
the players who assemble on Sundays.
Following are some of the matches
played: , .

4 â 3; Joe Daily beat Kenyon, 0 â 1, 6 â 3.
In doubles the matches resulted as fol
lows:
Some fast matches were played on the
California Club courts yesterday. Most of
the cracks were absent, but the lower
class men were out in force. H. W.
Crowell and W. B. Collier, the veteran
team, had their hands full when they
took on Orville Pratt and Sherwood Ad
ams. The latter hardly class with their
opponents as a doubles team, but Collier
and Crowell had to play their best to win
from the youngsters. The losers played a
dashing game at the net, but their op
ponents were too steady for them, and
finally *von out after two close sets. The
score was 7â5, 6 â 4. Drummond MacGavin
was in fine form and won three straight
sets from his father. The latter has
played only a few times in the last year
and could do nothing with the swift
ground strokes of his son. The score was
6â0, 6â L 4â1. MacGavin Sr. plays a
graceful game, but is unable to cover the
court like the younger men. Crowell is
showing more improvement at present
than any of the other cracks and is now
well up In the first class. He beat Collier
rather easily yesterday, the score being
6â1, 7â5, 3 â 4. Up to a month ago Crowell
rarely won from Collier, but lately he has
been taking him into camp without much
difficulty.

The special stake resulted in great
coursing. The talent figured wisely in this
event and called all but four of the
courses.
P. J. Horgan's young greyhound Musket
took first honors in the open stake at Un
ion Park yesterday. Musket is by Magnet-
Manila and is nineteen months old. When
it is considered that this is Musket's first
time out its performance will be recorded
as . a sensational one. The young dog
went through the stake like a campaigner
and made an almost incredible showing
against its more experienced and seasoned
opponents. Form players found it an ex
pensive indulgence to place their money
against the newcomer's chances. In its
five, courses Musket was quoted four
times on the short end and once at even
'money.
White Hat. a 1 to 5 choice, was Mus
ket's first victim. Then followed Lear
King at 3 to 5. Full Moon at even, Fenii
at 1 to 3 and Haphazard at 3 to 5.
Musket led every hound it met, and
closed its clever performance by winning
the final without allowing Its opponent to
score.
The Rev. Mr. Leavitt said in the course
of his sermon: "To-day many of the
United Commercial Travelers are present
and I may not have a chance of speaking
to them again, therefore I would wish to
remind them of the influence they wield
especially on those with whom they come
in contact in the country, the towns and
the hamlets. They set the style which .s
followed by the young men of the places
they visit, therefore they are in influence.
I would say this to you gentlemen: On
your travels you have a chance to make
the country better, for you are looked ap
to by the country people. Your stories
and your methods, good or bad, are lis
tened to and are watched and copied from
one end of the country to the other and
therefore, it is essential that your acts be
upright on your journeys throughout the
land.
The Grand Council of California of the
United Commercial Travelers of America,
in response to an invitation of the Rev.
Bradford Leavitt, attended the First Uni
tarian Church. Franklin and Geary
streets, yesterday morning.

LOS ANGELES. "
OAKLAND.
Both Cristall and Jones pitched in grand
form, not a hit being made off the former
till the sixth. Cristall kept all his safe
ties scattered and never did he allow more
than one in a single round. Mohler played
his usual brilliant game around second
and Hannivan showed up fast in left field.
Reilly also accepted some hard chances at
third and was the only one among the
Angels to make more than one hit. His
first safe crack brought in the only tallies
for Morley. The score:
more scoring was done until the seventh,
when Francks made himself a. great man
by lifting a sky-scraper over center field
fence. This tied the score. In the last
agony when two were out and the fans
looked wise and said it was good for about
'steen innings, Dunlevy drove . a pretty
single into right and Francks ended his
day's brilliant work by shooting it over
the left center field fence for the home
run he was buffaloed out of.
The close decision happened in the sixth,
with two gone to the benches. Walters
had singled over second and Streib had
taken four bad ones, when old Peter lined
out a beauty to center field. Walters
made a fine slide at the plate and was ap
parently, safe before Anderson â¢ received
Householder's throw, which was a sort of
a gold brick. OlConnell did not see Wal
ters touch the plate and Anderson put the
ball on him after he was In, so the umpire
called the runner out. .. :

Owing to a break In the cable, the cars

St.- Domlnic'8 Church was crowded last
evening, when the Rev. Father J. L.
O'Neil delivered another of his lectures in
connection with "The Retreat for Men,"
conducted under the auspices of the Holy
Name Society, established in St. Dom
inic's Church.
The Rev. Father Pius Murphy and
"many other of the clergy were present.
The object of the retreat has been to
offer extraordinary opportunities for hear
ing the word of God, for worthily receiv
ing the sacraments and for advancing
the Apostolate of the Holy Name/of
Jesus. . â¢ 'â¢"".'â¢'
For eight evenings Father O'Neil has
addressed Â¦''. congregations, which have
been larsr* and devout. - * , '
Last evening the special exercises and
series of lectures were brought to a close.
They commenced with a solemn reception
to the Holy Name Society, followed by
the discourse, "Be thou faithful unto
death." '
The Rev. Father O'Neil Said that â¢ it
was essential to lay a foundation of
strength in re^glon, not such a, one that
was temporary, but one that must be
lasting. He besought his hearers to fol
low righteous lives and in every sense
clean and circumspect lives. Men, he
said, should avoid all vain amusements,
idle conversations and useless reading
and apply themselves earnestly to the
great affair of. 'their eternal salvation.
Only God knew how near we were to
eternity, and those who have at any time
led others to sin, said the lecturer, should
repair the past by leading others to God.
The series of addresses has been attend
ed with marked success and the dis
courses have been delivered before many
hundreds of men and youths. , -'.-Â¦
The resolution was adopted by a unani
mous, vote, and a committee will take
charge of the matter.. .^- Â¦-.-;;Â« :'-
'The stars and ' stripes monument In the
church known as Holy Trinity of the Mlnorles,
London, ' England, bears the Washington arms
â the eagle and the stars and stripes â and the
tlve-pointed stars and red stripes are presumed
to have suggested the design lor the American
flag and. since this monument marks the
burial . place of Elizabeth Washington, s of the
family-from which George Washington 'directly
descended,- ' its maintenance is of deep Interest
to "tho Sons of ( the American Revolution, and
it should be most carefully safeguarded. Rev.
James F. Marr, rector of the parish, has writ
ten that an annual expenditure of $250 Is neces
sary for the maintenance of the monument and
the accommodation of American visitors to the
church. ' and has also announced that the co
operation of the Sons will be gladly, accepted.
Therefore, be , It : -. .-../.
Resolved, That the president be and hereby Is
requested to appoint a committee of three on
the stars and stripes monument, with full
power to .act.; who?e duty It shall be to in
quire into the conditions of church and monu
ment and who shall, If the inquiry proves sat
isfactory, arrange for subscriptions from the
.State societies- to the aggregate amount of
$250, with Â¦ the understanding that the money,
â¢will be forwarded to Rev. Â¦ J. F. Â¦ Marr, or the
church authorities, for use in the maintenance
of ; the monument and the accommodation of
American visitors to the church.
Some time ago William M. Bunker, past
president of the California Society, while
In London, visited a church known as
Holy Trinity of the Mlnorles. > He was
shown a marble slab, about 3x6 feet In
dimension, erected to the memory of
Elizabeth, niece of Lawrence Washing
ton, the latter an ancestor of George
Washington, and surmounting this slab
he saw a shield on which are the Wash
ington arms, the eagle and the stars and
stripes, the origin of the American flag.
It bears the five-pointed stars and the
broad stripes which gave the. idea for the
flag of the United States. He concluded
that what he designated as the "stard
and stripes monument" ought to be pre
served by the American people, and par
ticularly by the Sons of the American
Revolution, so at the session. of the con
gress named he Introduced a resolution
in the following words, after having
made a patriotic, address:.. .
Colonel A. S. Hubbard of the San Fran
cisco Society of the Sons of the American
Revolution received a detailed account
of the session of the congress of the dif
ferent societies held at Washington. D.
C, on the last day of April. From this
it appears that California has again come
patriotically to the front. It was in Cali
fornia that the first society of sons of
heroes of the Revolutionary War waa
started ;. it was California that first start
ed the association outside the'llmlts of the
State, and now It lsCalifornia that is first
in a movement to preserve an historical
monument in a foreign land.

ers, which owes allegiance to. the Build
ing Trades Council, prepared an answer
last night to. the statement issued Satur
day night by the new District Council of
Carpenters and Joiners pertaining to the
dispute that exists between the two or
ganizations.
It is asserted In the answer that the al
legations made In the statement of the
new District Council 'to the effect that P.
!H. McCarthy had ihe constitution of the
Building Trades Council changed in order
to disrupt the brotherhood of the State
are false. It Is also asserted that the con
stitution of the Building Trades Council
was misquoted in the new council's state-
Mr. Butler and Mr. Thurman In their
answer declare that Union No. 1082 and
also the new Council of Carpenters and
Joiners exist in direct violation of the
general constitution. It is emphatically
denied in the answer that P. H. McCar
thy is responsible for the existing trouble
or that he Is using his position to ad
vance his political Interests.

of the Blessed Virgin Mary assembled in
their chapel yesterday morning, and went
from there In a body to receive holy
communion at St. Ignatius Church.
This society, which was established in
1861, has now grown so large (the Gen

750 and the Ladies' about 1200) that it i3
the intention to very soon remove from
the present quarters. The . sodalities pro
pose to amalgamate and erect a build

the funds being raised by subscription
from the members of the combined so
cieties.

GENTLEMEN'S SODALITY
TAKES HOLY COMMUNION
WASHINGTON, May 11.â Because it
may seem to condemn the friars the Pope
is opposing the proposal of the .United
States that he authorize the sale of
churchy lands in the Philippines. This is
the real obstacle in the way of the pur
chase by this Government of property
owned by the clerical orders.
When Governor Taft vislt3 the Vatican
he will suggest the appointment of a
mixed American and church commission
to appraise the lands, the price they agree
upon to be paid by this Government. Up
to this time the church has shown a de
cided unwillingness to part with Its prop
erty. An investigation made by Arch
bishop Chapelle showed him, it 13 stated.,
that but a small percentage of the friars
were guilty of excesses and that they
were for the most part upright, honorable
men. He opposed any action that would
tend to give the impression of condemning
the friars, and his views have been
adopted by the Pope. Nevertheless, It la
necessary in the interest of good order,
the authorities here say. that the friars
should not return to the Philippines. Gov
ernor Taft's mission to ,the Vatican is a
most delicate one. and the President and
Secretary Root will be highly gratified If
it meets with success. -
POPE IS NOT WILLING
TO SELL CHUKCHI LANDS
The fire probably originated because of
a defective electric .wire, but the exact
cause will never be known. The powdered
dust arising from the wood-worKing ma
chines coated the interior of the old build
ing and exploded with the first contact
of flames. The entire building was blaz
ing before the alarm, could be given. A
train of cars partly loaded with boxes,
standing In front of the building and the
otflce, situated a hundred feet distant,
were almost instantly on fire, together
with scores of towering lumber piles.
It was the closely >plled lumber 'and the
compact bundles of box material which
caused the fire to last so many hours. A
number of larger piles of lumber have
blazed fiercely all day and are lighting the
town to-night. There was not a. breath
of wind, and although many houses were
scorched on Main street and several
caught fire, no losses occurred except to
the lumber company. More than a million
feet of lumber was saved, although many
of the piles destroyed were but a few feet
distant. The flames rose vertically to a
height of 200 feet and were seen at Clarks
Station, Nev., ninety miles distant. A
dozen times the town seemed doomed, but
there was an abundance of water and the
men fought as only those can who fight
for their homes. .
The loss is certainly $200,000. It is be
lieved the insurance was $20,000, but the
policies are in the San Francisco office of
the company. To-morrow morning the
company will commence rebuilding. Con
tracts had been made in advance for mil
lions of feet of boxes and millwork and
it is believed the new factory will be run
ning next month.
TRUCKEE, May 11.â Six acres in the
central portion of Truckee were a raging
mass of flames for seven or eight hours
this morning. The extensive box factory
and planing mill of the Truckee Lumber
Company, around which the town was
orisinally built, was totally destroyed and
with it went the office with everything
it contained and a number of warehouses
and dryhouses filled with boxes,, seasoned
lumber, glass, windows, doors and build
ing material. One million feet of lumber
piled on both sides of the river waa also
destroyed. ' .
Rodden had been asked by a friend,
who was suddenly ordered out on an
overland train as fireman, to get his
jumper and overalls and bring them,
down to the train. The fireman friend
did not have time to go home and get
his garments, and Rodden agreed
to do this for him and to meet
the overland train at the land end of the
mole, so that the fireman might have
them on his trip. This Rodden did, meet
lng'the overland train a few minutes be
fore 7 o'clock. The overland slowed
down so that Rodden could hand the
bundle of clothes to the fireman. Rod
den passed up the garments, said good
by, got his thanks and,<etepped back on
another track aa the heavy overland
train began to pick up its speed. As he
stepped backward he stepped directly in
front of the Alameda local and was
ground to death under Its wheels.
Rodden was 40 years of age, and leaves
a wife and four children living at 1687
Eighth street. Engineer Smith of the
Alameda local says that Rodden stepped
back from the overland train almo3t di
rectly in front of his engine, apparently
not thinking that the Alameda track was
bo close to where he was stepping, and
as the train was very near him It was
impossible to stop.
James Rodden, an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company at the West
Oakland yards, was struck and instant
ly killed by the Alameda local train at
7 o'clock this evening while trying to do
a small favor for a fellow employe of the
company.

Explosion of Sevros'
. Machine Kills Two
Aeronauts.
Serious Accident Occurs Dur
ing Experiments in
. i Paris.
PARIS, May. 12.â The airship belonging
to Senor Auguste Sevros, the Brazilian
aeronaut, made an ascension this morn
ing. The airship exploded and Sevros and
one of his assistants who was on board
were killed.
Senor Sevros' airship, called La Paix,'
had made two ascensions at the Vaugar
arsa Aero station since May 4. Upon both
occasions La Paix was held by a rope at
the height of forty metres. In this posi
tion the airship maneuvered for a short
time successfully. . ; -. * .. â¢, â¢"â¢â¢ .
La Paix was not unlike Santos Dumonfs
airships In appearance, but it differed
from them in many details. The. gas
capacity of La Paix was nearly four times
greater than that' of Santos Dumonf a
balloons. It had three . main propellers
and two smaller ones, used for steering
and in ascending and descending.
The two petroleum motors of La Paix
were of twenty-four and sixteen, horse
power, respectively. After the , ascension
of May 4 Senor Sevros said he would not
make another trial -until there was per
fectly fair weather, and that he would
then attempt to, extend his flight. Upon
this occasion Seoor. Seyros and; two as
sistants went up in the airship. - , . -
Auguste Sevros has occupied himself
with the problem of air-flying - for more
than twenty years. In 1881 he carried' out
some interesting steerage kite ' experi-.
ments in Brazil. . In 1884 he, constructed a
large steerable balloon, but the results
with this were not satisfactory. Sevros
was at one time deputy -'and president o*
the budget committee In the Parliament
at Rio de Janeiro. He ; was born abdut'
forty years ago. , â¢ â¢Â¦ Â¦.

JOYOUS CUBANS
WELCOME PALMA
President - Elect of the
Republic Arrives
in Havana.
Citizens Honor the
' Executive.
Thousands of Enthusiastic
(HAVANA, May 11.â At 7:30 o'clock this
morning a large Cuban flag was hoisted
over Morro Castle here, a signal that the
steamer Julia, with President-elect Palma
and his party on board, had been sighted.
Cheers went up from the thousands who
had awaited the Julia's arrival since day
break â cheers for the new President and
for the flag which was hoisted over the
famous fortress for the first time.
It was a moment of exultation for the
Cubans, and the fact that the Stars and
Stripes floated from its customary flag
staff beside the Cuban flag over the castle
did not lessen their enthusiasm.
A great fleet of vessels that had gone
out to escort the Julia in returned two
hours later. As the Julia entered the har
bor bands stationed along the water front
played the Cuban national hymn, steam
ers saluted continually, there were cheers
from the crowded wharves and church
bells were rung. The procession entered
between rows of decorated tugs and
barges. The several warships In the har
bor also were decorated. Near by the
Stars and Stripes floated over the wreck
of the Maine, and under this flag
streamed a black â¢ and white pennant,
placed there by the Cuban commission in
charge of the festivities.
At the wharf the President-elect was
welcomed by Vice President Esteve and
Senora Durce, each delivering a brief ad
dress. A feature here was twenty- three
youngr Cuban women dressed in costumes
representing the American republics.
Later the President-elect was escorted
by members of the Rural Guard to the
palace, where he was received by Gov
ernor General Wood. From here the
President-elect proceeded to the Munici
pal Council building, where speeches were
made by the Mayor of Havana and Senor
Zayas. The latter welcomed Senor Palma
in behalf of the people of all classes and
all political beliefs.
Replying, Senor Palma said that his re
ception was a gratifying experience, and
judging from, what he had seen since his
arrival in Cuba the people were unani
mous in support of the incoming govern
ment. This, he said, boded well for tho
republic. General Wood accompanied
Senor Palma to the residence of General
Maximo Gomez, where he will reside un
til his inauguration, May 20.
A breakfast was given by the Municipal
Council in honor of the President-elect,
and in the evening a dinner was tendered
him, General Wood and General Gomez
and other prominent Cubans being pres
ent at the latter function. Mrs. Estrada
Palma will be welcomed officially when
ehe arrives from New Tork to-morrow.

London Times Gives the
Detaiis of the Peace
Negotiations.
Fears the Election in Buray
Will Greatly Influence
tho Boers.
LONDON. May 12.â The Times this
morning relates the course of the peace
negotiations as follows:
"On the receipt of the Dutch correspond
ence intimating; that Great Britain was
ready to listen to proposals from the
Boers in the field, acting President of the
Transvaal Schalkburger came to the
British lines and asked permission to con
sult with Steyn, former President of the
Orange Free State. This led to the Boer
delegates going to Pretoria. Their first
proposal to Lord Kitchener and Lord Mil
ner, the British High Commlsisoner In
South Africa, was that the republics
should merely concede all the demands
made by Great Britain regarding the fran
chise, etc., before the war.
"The British Government, in reply, re
ferred them to the Middleburg conference
as the maximum of possible concessions,
and refused permission to the Boers to
consult their friends in Europe. Eventu
ally, while refusing an armistice. Lord
Kitchener undertook not to molest the
burghers while they were actually hold
ing meetings with the commandoes to
authorize the leaders to negotiate on the
basis of the surrender of Independence,
but they were told it was useless to re
turn to Pretoria without being armed
with full powers to negotiate.
"Schalkburger assented to this, but
Bteyn's a<Â»quiescence seemed doubtful.
"Mail advices received from Pretoria,"
continues the Times, "declare that Lords
Kitchener and Milner promised generous
compensation for burned farms, raised no
difficulty with regard to the question of
amnesty for rebels, and did not present
insuperable difficulties."
The Times in an editorial on this mat
ter is not hopeful that peace -will be the
outcome of such negotiations and fears
that the result of the election of a mem
ber of Parliament for Buray, Lancashire,
will Influence the Boers to further resist
ance.
Arrested for Burglary.
John Stafford, 19 years of age, was ar
rested last night at his residence, 228 First

Cavanaugh on a charge of burglary. He
â¢was Identified by Mrs. Upstein as one of
the burglars whom she saw break into
her husband's eecond-hand store at 538
Mission street yesterday afternoon. The
officers who made the arrest found a bag
of burglar's tools in Stafford's house.

A Benefit
if it teaches you that
Better health
Greater strength
Keener brain
come from
Grape=Nuts
Try the change arid "cut out" 'meat for breakfast.
Our word for it you will feel "Fit as a Lord" in a week's time
by breakfasting on Grape-Nuts and cream, a little fruit and per-
haps one or two soft eggs.
If you ever try this experiment you will always bless the day
of high beef that waked you up.
There's a reason why Grape-Nuts furnishes power to the body
and brain. The food contains selected parts of the field grains
that furnish phosphate of potash in a natural state that can be
assimilated by the human body ; this joins with the afbumen of
food and forms the soft filling of the brain and nerve centers.
Feed skillfully and you can "do things."
The greatest brain workers in America eat Grape-Nuts.
Ask one or two, they'll tell you.
You meat eaters who are ailing in any sort^of way might take
a valuable hint from the following statement of Chief Chemist
Wiley, of the Agricultural Department, in the Daily Press, from
which we give the following extracts: â
. *
"There is no doubt of the fact that meat-eating is not essential to hitman life
and that men can be well nourished without resorting to a flesh diet.
"I think the statement may be accepted without question that, as a rule, we eat
too much, not only of meat, but of all forms of food. The question of limiting the diet
is based primarily not ori/thc principle of economy,' but on the requirements of hygiene.
"At the early breakfasts which Americans are wont, to indulge ini that is, a-
hearty meal before going to their daily work, the omission off meat is tobe earnestly
odvi*>cd.
*' It is well known that men who are nourished very extensively oh certain cereals
arc capable of the hardest and most enduring labor. Meats are quickly digested, fur-
nish an abundance of energy soon after consumption, but are not retained in .the
digestive organism long enough to sustain permanent muscular exertion."
You will feel the Energy of Grape-Nuts longer than any msal
of meat.
Remember Grape-Nuts food costs about one cent" per meal for
each person and all grocers sell it.^ .

to be some redhot metal in the bottom,
and when water struck it there was a
terrific explosion. A piece struck Ranney
on the f orehad and knocked him sense

OF TERRIBLE AGONY
TACOMA, May 11.â There are three
traveling men who will not again venture
to cross Puget Sound in a rowboat soon.
While making the trip from Lopez to
Friday Harbor ,in a rowboat early last
week they ran straight into a school of
blackflsh which was followed by three
large whales. Had it not been for the
fact that the whales were more than
busy devouring the black fish, of which
they were in rapid pursuit, the trip would
probably have resulted disastrously for
the rowboat voyagers. When they reached
Friday Harbor they were nearly exhaust
ed, and declared it was doubtful several
times whether they would ever reach
land. Almost before they knew it they
had rowed into the midst of the black
fish and whales, the latter being so close
that the water around" their boat was
greatly agitated. The fumes from the
spouting whales was nauseating. Several
sportlly inclined men of Friday Harbor
took a. steam launch after the arrival of
the traveling men and viewed the mon
sters at a safe distance. The traveling
men who thus uarrowly escaped were D.
M. Peeples of Seattle, H. C. McAllister
of Chicago and R. F. Clark of New York.

THREE WHALES PTJBSUE
'Â¦'/Â¦ SCHOOL OF BLACKFISH
5 The news of the drowning of the two
girls was immediately brought to town,
and an effort is being made to, recover the
bodies. A guard has been placed at the
dams further down the river, where it Is
thought the bodies will float with the cur
-Tent.
The water where the craft went over is
flowing in a mass ten feet wide and as
many feet deep. The, great volume of
water swamped the boat almost instantly.
-The women were never seen after the
boat passed . over the dam. Young Von
derhyde managed to reach a rock in the
center of the river, where he clung for
over an hour until help was procured and
he was rescued by the aid of a rope. The
other boy managed to reach shore ex
hausted and bruised.
The two young women, in company with
their brother George and William JCattle
man, were fishing from a boat and ven
tured too near one of the mill dams. The
river has been out of its banks for the
past week, and this great volume ot
water drew the boat toward the dam. The
young men fought for their lives and
those of the girls, but were finally ex
hausted. The boat with its terrified pas
sengers-was drawn over the dam.
.CARSON, Nev., May 11.â Early this
afternoon the two daughters v of George
Vonderhyde, Misses Ada and Lola, were
drowned in the Carson River at a point
three miles below this city.

The well known druggist has been en
joying a tour of the\world with a party
of friends. They left' New York on May
15, 1901, In Emerson's yacht Margaret and
visited Europe and then proceeded to the
Orient. The yacht was sent home from
Singapore and the tourists came to this
country on a regular liner. .The party
will visit the Yosemite and Yellowstone
parks and proceed East in a private car.
The tourists are I. E. Emerson and
valet, Miss Margaret Emerson and maid,
Mrs. E. P. Jenkins, Miss M. L. Jenkins,
Dr. Smith McKim of Baltimore and Mr.
and Mrs. Gerard Stuyvesant , of New
York. â¢
"That stuff you gave me," said the cus
tomer, "is the greatest thing I ever came
across. You would make a fortune If
you put It on the market."
Emerson replied that he would like to
do so, but that it would take considerable
ca'pital. The result of the conference was
that the druggist formed a business com
bination with the wealthy man whose
headache he had cured. '.'Bromo-seltzer"
was put on the market and -well adver
tised, and the sales quickly reached enor
mous proportions and Emerson accumu
lated a fortune. .\ >
In about half an hour the customer re
turned and asked for another dose of tht
headache cure. He was accommodated
by Emerson and sent ori his way rejoic
ing. The next morning the wealthy man
again visited Emerson and advised him
to put the headache cure. on the market.
Emerson at that time kept a drug store
and was asked by his wealthy patron to
mix him a cure for | a headache. The
druggist did as requested and his cus
tomer left the store.
The fortune that Emerson has made
out of "bromo-seltzer" had Its foundation
some few years ago In a headache that -a
wealthy merchant of Baltimore was suf
fering from one spring morning. * â¢ \
