his office of Commissioner of Public
Works and receives compensation there
for. He has not been obliged to forfeit
his army pay in order to serve the city,
hence it is argued that General Shafter
would* not . be compelled to forfeit,' his
Government allowance if he were called
to the service of the State as Governor
of the commonwealth. However, the rulÂ©
established by General Stoneman 1 s resig
nation cannot -be overlooked, because ha

ernor.
There is an â¢ impression that Shafter
would fee. elected by a phenomenal ma
jority. His long and honorable service In
his country's cause has won for him the
bitter hostility of the. yellow press. In
that respect he would possess a special
element of strength, for' people of both
parties are quick to take advantage ot
every legitimate opening to rebuke th*

Chile ordered these new vessels to be
built after Argentina, whose navy . Is
stronger than Chile's, had decided to
purchase two powerful battle-ships from
the Italian Government. Many Chileans
believe that Argentina's desire for naval
fcupremacy in disregard of her ability to
pay heavy debts is traceable, . in a large
measure, to tempting t commissions of
fered to her statesmen by agents of nh'ip
builders. Chile Is thus forced to Increase
her naval strength, and her inhabitants
are living under , the- strain .of Â¦ constant
menace from three neighboring republics."
The foreign relations outlook, however,
was represented as good in the meeting
of the Cabinet Council yesterday.

Though Major Walle*'- made his charges
under oath, the War Department believes
they are exaggerated and is disposed to
regard General Smith's denial as suffi
cient answer. General Chaffee will con
sider Major Waller's statement in con
nection with any further proceedings,
but as he approved General Smith's plan
of campaign any action he may take
will probably not be important. It was
said at the department this afternoon
that as soon as the natives had been con
quered General Smith had Issued an or
der dated February 22 last, announcing
that "Active opposition to our occupa
tion of the island has crumbled away.
There are undoubtedly a considerable
number of rebels left in the mountains,
but their power of resistance Is shattered.
We nave In the past compelled them to
respect us by force of arms, and we must
in future compel them to respect our gen
erosity of heart for a vanquished foe
end our purity of purpose in waging war
upon their misguided leaders and their
followers."
PARMY AND MARINES.
The effect of the statement of Major
Waller has been to intensify the feeling
between the army and the marines. One
enny officer said to-day that even If
Smith had given the order Major Waller
alleges, an army officer would never have
observed it. The marines assert that Wal
ler was justified in executing the order
given him, and point to the fact that
obedience is the cardinal virtue of a sol
dier. From their point of view. Major
Waller's charges are substantiated by
the letter of the Civil Governor of Taya
bas, which Secretary Root transmitted
yesterday to the Senate Philippines Com
mittee, and which will be submitted lo
the committee at a meeting to-morrow.

pacified. The plan was similar to that
observed in Indian campaigns in our own
country. General Smith became indig
nant at Major Waller because the latter
insisted on taking prisoners and then con
stituting himself a court to try them and
order their execution. The country should

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
TT., WASHINGTON. April 9.â When Ma
jor Waller of the United States Marine
Corps made his sensational charge that
Brigadier General Jacob Smith, command
ing the troops in Samar, had ordered the
extermination of natives, he threw a
bombshell which has exploded in the War
Department. At army headquarters Lieu
tenant General Miles feels that there has
been quick substantiation of his state
ment that the war in the Philippines has
been conducted with "marked severity,"
and he believes the country will now ap
preciate that there was no ground for the
criticism made by the President and Sec
retary Root that he had assumed tbe
truth of charges reflecting upon the credit
of the army in advance of the investiga
tion which has been ordered without giv
ing General Chaffee, upon whose particu

immediately after the publication of the

Republican leaders in Congress said to
day that no amount of Investigation coul-J
remedy abuses of this character. In his
annual report to Congress Secretary Root
said: -
It was said to-day by prominent lead
ers that no action of this kind is prob-.
able, but that possibly the result will
be Congressional authority to the War
Department to change the transport serv
ice, as suggested by Secretary Root in
his annual report.
It is said that Secretary Root has known
for some time of the abuses that have
been going on in the Pacific, and has been
anxious to remedy them. Some of these
it is impossible to correct, as for in
stance when it has become necessary for
quick action in obtaining and fitting out
transports it has been impossible to get
this done at reasonable rates.

WASHINGTON, April <>.â Throughout
to-day's'sesslon of the Senate the Chinese
exclusion bill was under consideration".
Galllnger of New Hampshire and Dilllng
ham of Vermont opposed the bill, and
Turner of Washington supported it. Gal
linger urged that the pending bill was urn
necessary, unjust and un-American, and
was clearly" ln contravention of our treaty
obligations with China.
' Turner, 'in reply to Gallinger, contend
ed that the pending bill is no more severe
than former laws for the restriction or
Chinese immigration. He asserted that
,the,blll is practically a re-enactment or
existing law, except that u is more lib
eral in the admission cf Chinese mer
chants. He also asserted that the most
'stringent provisions of the bill had been
drawn by Treasury officials, and were
made necessary by the craft and guile
of the Chinese In evading treaty obliga
tions. He also declared that every pro
vision of the bill is in conformity with
the treaty with China, and said that well
meaning Chinese could take 'no excep
tion to its provisions. He defended the
provision prohibiting the employment 01
Chinese crews on vessels going to sea, â¢
and said ihat criticism of it is inconsis
tent witlrthe recent' action of the Senate
in voting the ship subsidy bill for the
purpose of enabling American ship-own
ers to pay extra wages' to. American sail
ors. -
Dillingham of Vermont addressed the
Senate 1 in opposition to the Chinese bill. '
He said he was heartily in favor of a law
which would exclude Chinese laborers In
accordance with the treaty of 1834. He
would vote, he said, for a substitute for]
the proposed bill, which In effect would
continue in force or re-enact the present
Geary law. That law -had served an ex
cellent" purpose, and was without serious
objectionable features. He thought that,
with two or three minor amendments, the
present law would satisfy any reasonable
advocate of Chinese exclusion. He be
lieved that the real question presented to
Congress was how best to protect Ameri
can labor, American citizenship and
American progress and -prosperity. All
were anxious that such protection should
be afforded. The dangers of the admis
sion of Chinese, he thought, had been ex
aggerated, and were not so serious as had
been pictured. All had agreed that the
operation of the existing law was satis
factory.
After a brief executive session the Sen
ate, at 5:05 p. m., adjourned.

CHARLESTON, S. C, April 9.â Greeted
and and honored by manifestations of the
respect and esteem of enthusiastic thou
sands, President Roosevelt was the guest
of the South Carolina Interstate and
West Indian Exposition to-day. The
weather was ideal.
The events of the day began with a
grand procession through the streets of
Charleston, and afterward there were
speeches in the auditorium, the presenta
tion of a sword by the President to Ma
jor Micah Jenkins, a luncheon at the
Woman's Building and inspection of
the grounds and buildings. The en
thusiasm of the people was unbounded,
and there was standing room only on the
sidewalks and porches and doorways anil
in the wide piazzas of the houses along
vhe line of march.
The parade started from the St. John
Hotel, the " President's auarters, at J 10
o'clock, and was composed of marines,
seamen, cadets, artillerymen and militia
men of four States, under command of
Colonel Charles Morris. U. S. A-. of the
garrison nt Sullivans Island. The route
v.as along Queen, Meeting, Calhoun,
Rutledge and Grove streets to the exposi
tion grounds, and time after time the
President stood la hfs carriage and. ac
knowledged with a smile and a bow the
enthusiastic applause of the people. . A
tally-ho containing members of Charles
ton's Harvard alumni, decked with col
lege colors, greeted the President with the
college yell. x
Ariving at the exposition grounds" the
President reviewed the troops from a
stand near the auditorium, Mrs. Roosevelt
stood at the President's left, and near by
were Mayor Smythe, Governor Mc-
Sweeney, Governor. Aycock and others.
The Pre'sident was particularly pleased
with the appearance and march of the
"jackies" and made several â¢ compli
mentary remarks as various State troops
passed before him.
Thousands Give greeting.
When. .the President entered the audi
torium, he bowed and smiled . his a"c
knowledgments to the cheering which
gre-eted r.im from 10,000 throais.
Flags and bunting were draped within
the building and a dais erected for Mr.
Roosevelt was covered with a large liag.
The audience heard the speaker with at
tentive appreciation and . cheered to the
echo many of the sentiments expressed,
but the President was the center of at
traction at* all times. President 1 Roose-'
velt's incisive, clear-cut words never fell
en more attentive ears. Mayor Smythe
introduced Mr. Roosevelt, who spoke as
follows:
It is to me a peculiar privilege to speak here
In your beautiful city. My mother's people
were from Georgia; but before they came to
Georgia, before the revolution, in. the days

claim your fitate as mine by inheritance no
\stm than by the stronger and nobler right
which makes each foot of American soil- in a

that her political relations with us. should dif

This exposition is rendered poesible because
,of the period of industrial prosperity through
which we are passing. While material wet 1
being is never all-sufficient to the life of a na
tion, yet it is the merest truism to say that
its absence mean* ruin. We need to build a
higher life upon it as foundation; but we can
build little Indeed unless this foundation of
prosperity Js deep and broad. > The^weli-bein*
which we are now enjoying can be secured only
through general business prosperity and such
prosperity is conditioned upon the. energy and
hard wÂ«rk. the sanity and the mutual â¢ reBtxvt
of all classes of capitalists. . large and small
of wageworkers of every degree. .. -
Ae is inevitable in a time of business pros-'
perity, some men succeed more than others
and it is unfortunately also inevitable thai !
when this Is the case some unwise people are
sure to try to appeal to the envy and jealousy
of those who eucceed least. It Is a rood thinÂ£
when, these appeals are made to v remember
that while It Is difficult to Increase prosperiS"
by law it is easy enough to^ruin it, and that
there.is email satisfaction to the less pros

FAINE'S CELEBY - COMPOTTND.
What! Does the firim Specter
Follow Yon Into the
Joyous Springtime?
PAINE'S CELERY
cdivipbUND
Defeats the Work of Death
by Removing Your Ter-
rible Burden of Disease.
. Are you "still in suffering, misery and
despondency? Does the grim specter
Death follow you closely as the Joyous
springtime brings- happiness- and blessings
to. others around you? Are you still cling-
ing, .tenaciously, to false theories of phy-
sicians or friends who persist in assuring
you that time, care and the use of your
present medicine will give you new
health? -. \ .
Be assured your present condition i3 a
perilous one. The continuance of the
medicine you are . now - using is a folly;
you are simply trilling with life and
wasting precious time, j
You should .remember that while na-
ture clothes the. fields with fresh grass
and flowers, and while the trees with a
strong life are showing bursting buds and
new-foliage, that human beingsâ old and
youngâ drop off. in .thousands in spring-
time. *
Now is the time for prompt, decided and
practical . action If life is - to be saved.
Prejudice and the' erroneous theories of
even medical men should be cast aside
when the hand of death is upon you. It
matters not what your social position beâ
the medicine that saves the humblest
manor woman is surely the one adapted
for the needs of the rich .and those ra
high social positions.
Paine's Celery Compound has a record
of life saving: that no other medicine can
ever equal. It has rescued rich and poor
from the grasp of death when physicians
and their most carefully prepared pre-
scriptions failed in the work. If the suf-
fering men and women of to-day could
but seo the happy- faces and hear the kind
words spoken by the tens of thousands
who have been made well and strong by
PalneVs Celery Compound, it would soon
dispel their existing doubts and fears.
PaJne's Celery Compound Is the only
medicine that reaches the root of dis-
ease; it is the only agency that can re-
move your terrible load of disease. Un-
solicited testimonials of cures pour in
every day. Young and old constantly bear
witness that rheumatism, neuralgia, kid-
ney disease, liver complaint, dyspepsia and
blood diseases are banished permanently
when Paine's Celery Compound Is faith-
fully used for a time. Begin its use to-
day/poor sufferer; delays are dangerous.

WILLIAMS, Ariz., April 9.â The story
told by Mrs. Bert "Ward, formerly Estelio
Baker, the girl chum of Nora Fuller, has
created quite a furor among the residents
of this city. The young woman, whoao
statements prove conclusively ,that Ncra
Fuller had been an Intimate friend of the
man who strangled her In the vacant
house on Sutter street, is still ill. City
Marshal James Kennedy, who first dis
covered the young woman's whereabonts,
did not attempt to get an official state
ment from her to-day owing to the non
arrival of Sheriff Johnson, from Flagstaff.
The City Marshal notified Sheriff Johnson
by telegraph to-day that Mrs. "Ward was
well enough to make a statement, and in
reply received a telegram stating that the
Sheriff would leave Flagstaff for this
point to-morrow.
The authorities here are convinced that
Mrs. Ward's â¢ information will shed con
siderable light upon the blind trail on
"which the San Francisco police have been
working since the body of Nora Fuller
was found In the house on Sutter street.
She is very positive in her statements.

ran through its streets; Â¦ killing, burning
and looting, they found a foreign official
there who was traveling from Canton. He
was dragged from his chair and barbar
ously hacked to pieces In the street. The
murder was reported to Governor Ting
She-ng by fugitives and he telegraphed
the news to Peking, whereupon the fol
lowing imperial edict was Issued:
"We have received telegrams from-Gov
ernor Ting Sheng Tao that In the Kwang

jointly plundering the people and he is
endeavoring to suppress them; and we
have also received. telegrams that at Ta

Health will come with all its blessings to those who know the way, and it is mainly a ques-
tion of right-living:, with all the term implies, but the efforts which strengthen the system,
the games which refresh and the foods which nourish are important, each in a way, while it is
also advantageous to have knowledge of the best methods of promoting freedom from unsani-
tary conditions. To assist nature, when nature needs assistance, it is all important that the
medicinal agents used should be of the best quality and of known value, and the one remedy,
"whieh-ftcts most beneficially and pleasantly, as a laxative, isâ Syrup of Figsâ manufactured by
the California Fig Syrup Co.
With a proper understanding of the fact that many physical ills "are of a transient char
acter and yield promptly to the gentle action of Syrup of Figs, gladness and comfort come to
the heart, and if one would remove the torpor and strain and congestion attendant upon a con- â¢
stipated condition of the system, take Syrup of Figs and enjoy freedom from the aches and
pains, the colds and headaches and the depression due to inactivity of the bowels.' In case of
any organic trouble it is well to consult a competent physician, but when a laxative is required
remember that the most permanently gratifying results will follow personal cooperation with
the beneficial effects of Syrup of Figs. It is for sale by all reliable druggists. Price fifty
cents per bottle. %r-
The excellence of Syrup of Figs comes from the beneficial effects of the plants used in the
combination and also from the method of manufacture which ensures that perfect purity and
uniformity of product essential in a perfect family laxative. All the members of the family
from the youngest to the most advanced in years may use it whenever a laxative is needed and
share alike in its beneficial effects. We do not claim that Syrup of Figs is the only remedy of
- known value, but it possesses this great advantage over all other laxatives that it acts gently
and pleasantly without disturbing natural functions, in anyway, as it.is free from every ob-
jectionable quality or substance. To get its beneficial effects it is always necessary to buy the
genuine and the full name of the Co.â California Fig Sy.rup Co.â is printed on the front of every

knows what he is doing. He will ' fight
Jeffries In England, but nowhere else.
In advancing the proposition, Fitzslm
roor.s stipulates only that his opponents
must be white. He say's; he will .meet
any five men in the world, one each night
for live- nights, end then wind up on the
sixth night with a battle with Jeffries

SAN FRANCISCO.
The first round passed with both teams
sparring for an opening. In the second
the Senators landed fine, and- then * let
Harris' . crowd have one to make ", the
score lot)k good. Things were quiet until
the third, when Rebeamen saw four bad
pnes pass : him; Bermingham followed
puit; ! Kebsamen' arrived at third on Fra-
force of Bermingham At second, and
when Kane forgot his teaching* and got
"wild, Rebsamen completed his trip.
. The game Rooked fairly well until the
sixth, the locals having . scored a- point
in the fourth. Then Fisher gathered his
forces and made some foVcer'ul and ap
propriate remarks, after Â¦ which things
changed. There was grim determina
tion on the face of every man. They
went after Harry Kane in a way that
made Harris look weak. Wagner started
it. He hit one to Bone, who began to
juggle, and Wagner landed an first. Then
Charley Graham came 'along with a bunt
and Hickey singled to right field. Tom
my Sheehan was there with a hit, which
fecored Wagner and put Hickey on the
third sack. Kane got frightened and
threw wide. This let Hickey off base
duty. Unglaub soaked one in McHale's
direction and Sheehan arrived on the
throw. Kane was again generous with
his free passes and Bone wSb bad again,
so "Truck" Eagan was allowed register.
In the meantime, the ghosts made a
couple of runs. Kane grew tired of is
suing complimentaries, and" took one
himself. He did not wait long, for Mc-
Hale sent the ball to deep center and
the lengthy one gambolled home. Mc-
Hale remained at third. In the. eighth,
Nordyke swung for two stations and
came Cn with the last run when Holly
hit passed third.
: Both Kane and Hickey were wild and
unsteady in the box. There is room for
a vast amount of improvement in their
work. Both were hit in a lively manner
whenever they located the plate, which
was seldom. A peculiar feature of the
contest was the number of men left on
bases. Sacramento had twelve and San
Francisco nineteen. The score:
Harris said his men enjoyed sea. voy
ages, and there would be nothing to it.
Fisher said his pets could all swim, and
if the boat was swamped* they would do
some fish stunts and win anyhow. A few
fans also went to see the trouble and
they were Joined by a -'few more on the
other side. When the grounds were
reached, about eight hundred cranks ana
some summer gins were present.
| Uncle's bunch thought they were still
on the briny, and whenever a ball came
near them they- went after it with an
underhand stroke. After Jack O'Connell
had worked hard for two hours he told
the boys to go home.. Scorer . McFarlin
then did a little mathematics- and in
formed Mike Fisher he was the goods.
Score, 7 ; to 3.

Mercury and Potash may dry up the sores and eruptions, but at the same

upon the tender tissues, membranes and nerves, finally breaking out in
most disgusting sores and even destroying the flesh and bones.

They have a palliative but not curative effect upon this treacherous snakel

teeth and corrode the membranes of the stomach and bowels, causing inflam-

seen by Chris Martin and Antolne Boesch,
who were working there. They asked
Martin and Boesch the way to the street,

out, and this aroused his suspicions. He
listened, and heard the noise of a drill
being worked. The noise stopped almost
immediately, and he then heard some
one running . from the office. Desmond
tried the door, but found it locked. He
blew his whistle, and Officers McGowan
and Hightower responded. One of them
telephoned to police headquarters, and
Detectives T. B. .Gibson and Riordan hur
ried to the scene.* They made an investi
gation, and discovered that entrance had
been effected to the office thrqugh a side
window by forcing the wfre screen. .The
safe â¢ had its " combination . knob knocked
off, and two holes had been partly drilled
through the door. In the office and in a

Webster's resolution that the Burnett
Grammar School be designated as the
liay View Grammar School was taken
under advisement.
The Golden Gate Valley Improvement
Club petitioned that an eight-room
schoclhouse be built in the district to
relieve the congested attendance in the
schools.
The Castro-street and Glen Park Im
provement Club notified the board that it
will eend a committee to request that a
schoolhouse be built in the Castro-street
Addition.
That Blanchard is and was guilty of unpro
fessional conduct for failing to keep a record
of all cases of corporal punishment adminis
tered in the Hancock School; also for assum
ing, without due investigation, that a note pur- .
poi-ting to have been written by Mrs. Raggio*,
was forged by her boy.
That Blanchard is guilty of immoral and !
unprofessiona.1 conduct fcr having sought to j
shield and justify himself for violating cer- I
tain rujes by shifting the blame for Raggio's
punishment on Miss Perry, and that since pub
licity has been given to the punishment of ;
Raggio Blanchard has called meetings of the |
teachers of the . Hancock Grammar School at i
which he has appealed to the teachers to help
him out of his difficulty.
The board took the report under advise
ment.
The board fixed the summer vacation
from June 6. 1902, to July 21. 1902. !
l>eaves of absence were granted to Miss
Esther Simms, Miss Rose V. Claiborne,
Miss L. A- Fenton and Miss Alice Mar
tin. â¢ i
Besides the infliction of undue punishment
on Raggio I find that Blanchard ordered Miss
Perry, an assistant teacher, to write on the
blackboard of her classroom that certain boys
whose names were given would be whipped in
the earns manner as Hapgio if they were agaiu
out of order. These acts of Blanchard are In
violation oÂ£ the rule ot order and discipline.
That on September, 1801, Blanchard caused
Miss Perry to enter in the public school regis
ter certain false statements In reference to Uie
punishment of R&ggio. That the register is a
public record and eaid entry is in violation of
the school laws of the State of California and
was an act of unprofessional conduct on the
part of Blanchard.
Superintendent of Schools Webster sub
mitted to the Board of Education yester
day his findings in- the investigation of
charges filed against Principal M. E.
Slanchard of the Hancock Grammar
School; Webster says in his report that
after examining thirty-seven witnesses
he finds that there has been corroborative
evidence that Blanchard inflicted exces
sive i>uniÂ£hment on pupil John Raggio
and compelled Miss Emma Perry, a teach
er in the Hancock School, to enter false
xecorda in the register. Webster there
fore deems Blaactiard guilty of unpro
fessional conduct. The report says:

Some of the municipal officials appear
to think that the law of 1897 is still .in
force', 'and have < , proceeded accordingly,
when there have really been effected rad
ical changes by the legislation of 1890.
There is a great diversity in the forms
of the sample ballots that have been sent
to this city. In some instances printers
in j San Francisco, after receiving- copy,
have notified those . who gave the { orders
â¢that- their directions did not conform to
the 'legal requirements in the premises.
Some have taken the hint. Others have
replied that they wished the orders car
ried Out exactly." aa they had been given.
;In such instances:the printers had -nQ"al
ternative, and did as they had been direct
ed to do. "Among the specific provisions
"devised by the legislators in 18W are ' the
following: â¢Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ Â¦ *. ;
Law Relating to Ballots. ..â¢ -
The list of candidates of the several parties
shall . be printed in parallel columns. The
number of columns shall exceed by one the
number of the separate tickets of candidates
to be -voted for at the polling place for which
the ballot is provided, except as otherwise pro
vided in thl3 section. - -
This ' discovery has been made i by the
collection ' by San -Francisco blank-form
publishers of sample ballots as they havo
been 'prepared for use at the elections to
be -held in the interior.. The largest col
lection of this sort has been made by. A.
Carlisle & Co. .Upon request Carlisle yes
terday, permitted a reporter for The Call
to look these samples over. When the law
was made in 1899 the legislators took .the
greatest pains to cover all the minutiae
of the . arrangement of ballots in. this
State for : the future. In addition to that
precaution : there is published in the offi
cial: Statutes and Amendments to the
Codes "of Calif ornia* a sample ballot, upon
'which the . various styles of type, -the
spacing required: by law and all the vari
ous particulars ' are supplied illustratively
as an object lesson. Notwithstanding
this; municipal officials ordering tne pririt
ing of ballots for use In the interior have
gone -wrong in a large number of '.n
stances and have now only- just time in
Â¦which to rlg-ht their errors.

Further ; reports from Constantinople are to the -
effect that serious disturbances resulting in '', irrhed
conflicts have taken place at widely separated points!
of European Turkey, and fears are"), felt that some-'
thing like a, general outbreak between Mohammedans'
and Christians is imminent. .It seems, therefore,. 1 that
the Greek Government was none too soon in calling;
attention to the agitations, and that the c Turkish
Governmen*t has been a little too slow'in ; preparing'
to. suppress them.
An eventual outbreak of sufficient violence to over
throw the existing order of things in European Tur
key is one of the few things on which the forecasters;
of the future of Europe are agreed. In fact,';it has
been nothing but a clear ; consciousness of the Immi
nent danger of such an outbreak that has prevented
it from occurring long ago, for had it not been,fore
seen and carefully guarded against by every resource |
known' to, diplomacy^ there would have -been - 'no '-j
DNCE more the Turkish, war cloud âwhich
hangs' permanently over Europe has begun
to emit flashes of fire and : . give signs of an ,
outbreak of activity in . the volcano below. Not
long ago the Greek Government called the attention
of the great powers and of Turkey to the dangerous
agitation going on in Macedonia and Bulgaria.! A
little later came the announcement that the Turkish
Government had arranged to mobilize 50,000 men
for service during the summer. , The two events
taken together gave warning that something serious
was going on among' the restless populations , of,
Macedonia and Bulgaria,' and now comes the news
\hatthe expected has -happened. . ;
Dispatches " from Vienna report ;. that Turkish
! troops have been sent. to four localities on the East
ern Roumanian frontier to^ guard it against an attaqk,
from Bulgaria; that the Turkish reserves neartlie,
capital had been ordered to hold themselves intreadi-!
ness to respond at once to an order to move, arid*,
that there has been already considerable fighting
along the frontier between the Turkish troops and.
small bands of Bulgarian adventurer's./ .. ; ;, Â¦

PERSONAL MENTION.
A FINE and well balanced ; renuir
tlon' of Gilbert & Sullivan's opera,
"Patience,"- was given last" night
at Native Sons' Hall by St. Pat
rick's Choral Society. Miss Etta
Welsh, the prima donnai and the.mem
bera at the chorus perfectly presented the
score, and the performance was- given
with a vim, dash and attention to detail
that showed earnest, painstaking work
on the part of all. ,
The opera was handsomely staged and
the ' participants were elaborately cos
tumed. Miss Welsh, with her clear bell
like soprano . voice, at once charmed the
audience, and . at each number, either in
solo, duo / or trio, ? she was accorded a
rousing reception. The chorus of milk
maids, the". esthetic-loving young women,
were particularly ' picturesque and sang-*
and acted like -. veterans. ' â¢ The"- soldiers*
chorus of twenty male voices was par
ticularly, effective and in -the finales of
each act came out very strongly.
A : ll the principals were excellent in their
several roles. â¢ Miss Sullivan, '^a3 '.'Lady
June; Miss Byrnes, 'as | Angela; Miss
Hausmann, as Ella, " v and Miss Anthony,
as Saphir, . deserve special commendation.
The entire cast was as follows:.; '

representatives of rural constituencies touch the canal
very gingerly, if they favor it at all. The opposi
tion may prove so serious that it must be met or sur
rendered to, and the friends of the canal need to be
stir themselves.
Those arguments are not published, and therefore
cannot be 'reviewed now, but the protest itself is such
in addition to the maze of complexities which in
volves many public questions that it will be the de
spair of those who have 'not studied the increasing
complexity of our whole industrial and productive
system. The friends of the canal in Congress have
not expressed themselves upon the attitude of the
farmers, but seem to be pausing, in doubt of what
action to take. If the argument of the farmers indi
cate a set and serious opposition, it will make many
President Roosevelt declared the protest so unex
pected and the arguments so different from any that
had been brought to his observation that he asked
for time to examine them.
Mr. J. C. Hanley, president and general manager
of the Allied National Agricultural Societies of
America, has called on the President to. file a strong
protest against an isthmian canal. Therein the farm
ers submit energetic arguments to prove the canal
detrimental to their interests and ruinous to their,
fndustry. This revelation that Mr. C. P. Hunting
ton was speaking for the farmers as well as for the
railroads is one of the most interesting features that
has appeared in any^ national matter in this genera
tion.
But now a blast comes from a class supposed to be
the natural enemies of the railroads, and there is evi
dence of the utmost surprise^ at Washington, and the
way of the measure through Congress seems less
easy than before. /* Â¦ .
The whole country could see a reason for railroad
opposition, and it was taken into account as some
thing that must be reckoned with by the friends of
the canal.
THE unexpected has happened all over the canal
issue. Heretofore it has been customary to at
tribute all opposition to the railroads. This
k as undoubtedly correct. The late C. P. Hunting
ten, who had the greatest courage of any American
financier and the most ample frankness of expression,
never scrupled to declare his opposition to the canal,
and every strong and debatable reason for Opposition
from a business standpoint originated with him.
His vast influence over the issue was .confessed by the
proponents of the canal, who renewed their energies
in the last session of Congress with the exclamation,
"Now that Huntington is dead."

EXIT THE- BARNSTORMER.
Western railroads are objecting now to, tlje conten
tion of the Federal- Government that cannon, horses
and ammunitioin shall be. carried as personal baggage
of soldiers. The /railroads certainly should be ready
to admit that in times of; emergency these articles
are not excess baggage to Uncle Sam's fighting men.
The development of a broad Americanism noted
by the President is deserving of. the emphasis laid
upon it, but the greatest change in Charleston . has
been not the enlarged sense of nationalism as op
posed to State pride and secession, but the change
from old aristocratic pretensions founded upon,
slavery to a full' recognition of the value of industry
and the worth" of workingmen. The present repre
sentatives of South Carolina in Congress say and
do many foolish things, but they do not scoff at
workingmen as "base born mechanics" and "mild
sills of society," as 'did their predecessors before the
war. Charleston has acquired the American social
ideal as well as the national ideal. The honors of
her exposition are. not to go to orators, constitu
tional lawyers, statesmen or generals, but to the men
who in the fields or in the machine shops are win
ning for her a more honorable place in the /Union
than she has ever held since the days when her great
Revolutionary statesmen gave place to the advocates
of slavery and the, agitators for disunion. '.',
Â¦ r At the. present time the whole South is-moving
swiftly forward in the industrial march. There is still'
a long and difficult journey to be made before South
ern industry is on a level with that of the North.
There is urgent need for ) better and fuller common
school education, for legislation restricting the em
ployment of child labor in factories, and for a pub
lic sentiment more earnest in maintaining law' and
protecting the weakest from violence; but despite
such defects in her social and industrial system, there
is a good deal in it worthy of the highest commenda
tion when contrasted with the evils of the past.
Certainly the path in which Charleston is now leading
the South is far better than that in which she led of
old- The hospitable greeting which all her people
have extended to the President meets a cordial re
sponse from the whole Union, and the response is
the more earnest because the occasion of the visit
and the welcome is one that shows a growing re
spect for labor as well as for the Union.
In his -.reply to the welcome that greeted him_on
his arrival in tlie city the President alluded gracefully
to the enlarged patriotism which in our time, has
eliminated the last trace of sectionalism from" the
hearts of the great mass of the American people. ' "I
feel at home in your city," he said, "and I think
that any American who is worth his salt has the
right to feel at home in -every part of the United
States. Around this table I see many men who took
part in the great war. The. war in which the younger
among us here took part was a very little one, be
cause it did not have to be any bigger. But it had
one thoroughly good effect; it put the cap on tlie
structure that has been building while we were almost
unconscious of it, and: it taught us how thoroughly
one we were. When we got through that war it did
not make a bit of difference to us whether it was an
admiral who came from Vermont or a . lieutenant
who came from Alahama, .if the man had done his
duty in such shape as to make us each feel an even
more generous thrill of pride in our common nation-,
ality. The debt that we owed him had little to do
with the section from which he came."
ROOSEVELT'S trip to Charleston serves to re
call to the people of the North and the West
that a grand exposition is open; in that city.
It is a new demonstration, of the bigness of this coun
try that such an enterprise should be in full %peraâ
lion in one section while in 'other sections it is hardly
given a passing thought. If for no other reason? than
that it i-ecalls to public 'attention the. marvelous in
dustrial awakening in the South as exhibited at the
exposition, the visit of the President is in the high
est degree gratifying. ..*u.w=T
-The Charleston exposition is not so. large nor so
comprehensive as .that at Buffalo, which immediately
preceded it, but it is the best that has yet been; held
in the extreme South. It represents high water mark
for that section in such enterprises, and there is some
thing of significance in the fact that, it should -have
been undertaken in the city whose traditions are no
table for anything rather than'for industrial or com-,
mercial enterprise. The greatest display at the expo
sition is,, in fact, the display of the new sentiment of
Charleston itself, and without the visit of the Presi
dent* that display would not have received anything,
like the consideration it deserves from the- rest of the
country!
The scheme of the committee seems to .be .the:
simple, one of exciting- violence wherever it can and
then making use of the consequent severity of the
Turkish Government in dealing with the insurgents
to rouse Christian sympathy against" the "unspeak
able Turk." Their one. object is,. to compel; a feor
ganization of .the whole of European Turkey, and.
the creation of, a "kingdom which wilHbe ' a sort of
independent standing ground for* the Slavonic races.
It is that very fact that make's the powers of Europe :
watch them so closely and so suspiciously. "There l",\$
probably no power that would lift ;Â¦ a hand to help .
the Turk; if it; were not that .'all of them , are" half
afraid of the menace of the spirit of "Panslayism.".
Hence the Greeks, were prompt to give the Sultan
notice of what the conspirators: have been doing. ,
Turkey, in factj may not be much loved; but no one
fears her, while, the Â¦ rising^demand of the" Slavs -for Â¦
nationality sounds in the ears of all Europe like a
tocsin of universal war. , â¢ . ,,-,
i .Despite' all ; that, diplomacy has been able to do,
I however; it has 'Â¦ not been possible .to : give, stable
' equilibrium to the decaying empire. The volcano of!
popular discontent among * the rebellious and half- .

Cargo by the Kosirios Liner.
THE American ship Iroquois has
been lost. The fate i of captain
and crew was not referred to in
the brief dispatch received here
yesterday from Macassar and the
belief ; in shipping circles is that they
were saved. The dispatch simply states
that ship and cargo arc a total loss.
The Iroquois on March 20 went ashore
in Sapis Straits, between the islands
of Sumbowa and Flores in the
Java Sea. She was floated, but found to
be leaking. .Before repairs could be: ef
fected a heavy storm tore her frorn her
anchorage and drove her to sea. That
was the last heard of her until the ar-.
rival yesterday of the dispatch . from
Macassar.
The Iroquois was well known in this
port. Her skipper. Captain Thompson,
and his wife, who always accompanies
him to sea, are natives of San Francisco.
Mrs. Thompson was a Miss Schurz. They
Â¦were married in 1SDS. Captain Thompson
and his brother. Thornton Thompson of
the Sclby Smelting Works, married sis
ters. -..-..- ' A
The Iroquois was built at Bath. Me., in
1S&L by Arthur Sewall. ' Her net regis
tered tonnage was 1997. She was 237:1
feet long, 43:6 feet wide and 27:9 feet deep.
Vessel and cargo were worth about ?250,-
C00, which is covered by insurance.
- The British ship Levernbank, Which arrived
oft port Monday night, was ordered to Portland,
where she will load wheat for Europe at 20s
3d.. Â¦ ' -, s .,-.Â¦Â¦'Â¦, .-
The French bark Saint Rogatien is chartered
for wheat to Europe at l!2s Cd, prior to arrival.
The schooner A. B. Johnson will load lumber
at Grays Harbor for Honolulu and the barks
Mohican and Olympic general cargo here for the
same port^ j

time, labor, and materials. He must deduct from the
apparent cost the saving in the longer life of the cake,
in the longer life of the, washed fabric, in the labor
required, in the time consumed, in the strength ex- |
pended, in the results obtained. When all is finished,

solicited- P. A. , McDONALD. : 813 Folsom Â»t.NEW YORK. April 9. â There was a notable
speculative movement in thÂ» stock market to
day, which was universally attributed to the
operations of an important v combination of
wealthy Western men, who were Important fac
tor* In the constituent companies going to
make ep the United States Steel Corporation
before it waÂ« organized. In the ordinary ac
ceptance of the term there was no news to ex
plain the movement of stocks or the enormous
buying which caused it. but the fact was pat
ent that the buyer* were possessed of practi
cally unlimited resources to transact business
en each a ecale and also that the faith In them
was Â«o strong that they were getting their
money's worth. While there was no .actual
news . accompanying the movement there waa
an abundance of rumors, which centered mgjstly
about Louisville and Nashville, which was
again the leader of the market in point of ac
lty and sustained etrengtb. The rumors
reached the etage of an alleged formation of a
community of Interest project for the whole
Southern field, which would supposedly take in
the Southern Hallway, Illinois Central and pos
elbly minor competing systems. Ther- were
minor explanations growing out of the â¢ an
nounced policy on the part of the Louisville and
Nashville to extend into uew territory which
involved the absorption of connecting lines en
tering Chicago. None of these rumors coull
obtain any official countenance. There ; wai
eome credence for a sugethtion that the mar
keting of the new ctock just announced had In
volved the creation of a large snort interest in
the market, for: the- relief of wnlch new ntoclc
will not be available cs a delivery until the
formalities cf listing on the Stock Exchance
tie ve been complied with. This explanation
would net apply to the notable broadening of
New York Stock Market.

â¢ A circular for Australia says: "Since the
steamship Ventura leit the following vessels
delivered cargoes of coal here from Newcastle.
New South Wales, viz. : .. Balclutha, 2432 tons;
Reine Blanche, 2632 tons; Windsor Park, 2777
tons; Crocodile, 3S20. tons; total, 11,661 tons.
There are twelve cargoes of colonial due here
wlthnl the next sixty days, in all about 32,000
tons. The total . tonnage already engaged for
coal :wlir foot up about .ttS.Oou tons (twenty
nine ships); some of these will not reach their
loading port (Newcastle) before July and Aug
ust. Coal freights are still quoted; exceptionally
lew,' with no perceptible evidence of any early
improvement. Importers are offering the lead
ing brands ot Newcastle at very enticing fig
ures, still business is not brisk, as our coast
producers have to meet the market, and have
marked down their rates so as to find sale for
their ' output. Fuel oil still -retains Its sur
ptemacy at prices which cannot leave much
margin to the well owners unless they are very
large producers and their property is suitably
situated to export, besides its character estab
lishes- its value. As the summer season is
near at hand the demand for domestic coals Is
becoming lighter, and the chances of introduc
ing colonial household grades will be slimmer.
Our transports are the best customers at pres
ent for Australian \ fuel, I as their engineers
seem to prefer it to any other that is offering,
and it is very doubtful if the department will
ever convert their steamers Into oil burners."

San Francisco Meat Market.
"General business continues in good condi
tion. High wages are promoting active con-
Eumption in all lines of manufactured goods;
and, as distributors throughout the country
appear to be carrying email stocks, the pros
pect Is for a good spring trade. At the same
time the rapidly increased cost of living is be
ginning to check consumption and may soon ex
press itself in more cautious buying in the
wholesale markets. The Iron and steel indus
tries continue in their state of phenomenal ac
tivity; though new competition is making Itself
felt, and, while many of the mills bold orders
that will keep them busy for months still
prices at first hands are not so steady as a
month or two ago. The textile trades seem
well employed; orders in sight are plentiful,
hence the willingness of both cotton and woolen
manufacturers to grant their employes advance
in wages. Any curtailment, however. In the
demand for staple cotton goods with cotton at
its present high level would seriously inconveni
ence cotton manufacturers; and the woolen
mills are not enjoying the eame degree of pros
perity that they did a year ago. Very soon the
crop outlook will be a factor; and the indica
tions are that high prices will encourage a
larger acreage for corn and cotton If not for
wheat also. Bountiful harvests would certain
ly insure us another year of prosperity. The
apprehension of gold shipments still hangs
over the stock market. But there Is no fear of
the money situation being disturbed thereby, as
any gold shipments will be doubly offset by the
return of funds from interior points to this
center from this time forth until we get back
all the money sent from here for crop-moving
purposes last fall, and this will remain here
until the next crop movement, which will be
about the middle of next August. Meanwhile
money will gradually grow easier and rates
lower, and the stock market cannot fall to be
stimulated by plethoric money, as it will fur
nish facilities to operators to carry stocks on
easy terms throughout the summer months. I
look for more activity in the stock market and
a higher range of prices generally in the Im
mediate future."

the speculative movement to-day into other
quarters of the market. Louisville and Nash
ville itself, while occasionally reactionary,
forged up to the top level, 5 points over last
night in the final dealings and closed within a
shade of that. The Southern Railway stocks
â¢were also lifted forcibly to the top level at the
last. The rest of the market showed the effect
of, realizing and some Important stocks closed
with net losses, notably New York Central,
Manhattan, Chicago and Northwestern common
and preferred and Rock Island. Some of the
minor railroads which have recently advanced
were also sufferers. While a large number of
Important stocks were included in the advance
the movement was by no means universal and
many prominent stocks were I neglected ! and
sluggish. United States Steel stocks still con
spicuously so. There was also the usual as
sortment of violent movements in high-priced
industrials, which are closely held by concen
trated interests. The electrical stocks and
New York Airbrake made wild advances and
almost equally sensational relapses. The rise
of 6% in New York and New Haven was unex
plained. American Snuff's 7-point gain was
practically all made on one sale.

fected by realizing and the market generally
was irregular. Total sales, par value, $5,535,

Babbitt says but little work can be
done now in the Dewey mine, as the
mill is idle because of "inability to get
fuel. Miners are opening- up the rich ore
and letting it stand, throwing the lower
grade over the dump. "We have trouble
keeping the miners employed," he said,
"because we can run "but a few feet in
any direction through the medium grade
ore without encountering the rich stuff
and we have to leave it standing."
"Practically everything there assays
Â¦well." said Babbitt. "By mistake some
blackish mudlike stuff got in with a -lot
of samples being assayed at the Dewey
mill. The assayer put it through and ft
essayed over 57 a ton. I picked up some
stuff one day that was like putty. Warm
ing in my hand, it began to run off like
quicksilver. For fun, I had it assayed,
and it ran considerably over $100 a tÂ«n."

"As soon as he can.be found, Morehead
will be arrested," said Attorney Marcuse.
Mrs. Ennis has placed her affairs in
the hands of Attorney George: Samuels.
The creditors have called a meeting to
decide what shall: be done with the res
taurant, which has been doing a â¢ good
business. Morehead wÂ«is for Â¦ five years
head steward at the Palace Bakery, and
only recently retired as president of -the
Cocks' and Walters' Union of this city.
The widow explained to-day that she
had trusted Morehead because of his
long, experience .in the restaurant busi
ness. It was her capital that was to be
used in refitting' the place, which Â¦ was
formerly the - Philadelphia Restaurant,
one of ' Oakland's old-time eating-houses.
But the returns show that Morehead
used his credit to the extent of $1300 or
Sl4i.ii. and, tit is charged, did not- put all
of the widow's (gold into the business. ..
It was upon her bill of sale that More
bead negotiated the chattel mortgage.'
The widow first learned that matters
were not right last week, when More
head was in San Francisco, claiming ho
was ill. Bills that Mrs. Ennis supposed
had been paid' wer* /"presented. -When
Morehead returned he was asked for ex
planations. He promised to rectify mat
ters, and secured from - Mrs. Ennis - a bill
of sale of her half interest in the restaur
ant. She was to receive $900 at once of
the^ money she had invested. Monday
came, but Morehead had vanished.
Left behind is '.Mrs. Â¦Millie Ennis,' relict
of William C. Ennis, a fireman j who lost
his life last August While fighting flames
in a North Oakland cottage. All Ennia
had for his wife and' children was : *a $2000

United ; Workmen. Of that: money 11900
was intrusted to Morehead by the. widow
to invest in the restaurant business. Â¦ . â¢.

commence "active campaigning and the
work, of gathering . into line all : the Re
publicans who are . opposed : to boss rule
and machine politics. It was decided to
inaugurate this work with a grand house

To-days session of the Landsthing was
very exciting. The opposition moved to
reject the treaty outright, but the mo
tion was lost by 28 to 35. The majority
report is understood to be couched in ex
treme terms, for the purpose of exact
ing some concessions on the. part of the
Folkething. The United States Minister
to Denmark, Swenson,. ignores the .com
munications which Captain Christmas
has addressed to him, denying the alleged
bribery of Congressmen.
The Landsthing will vote on the report
in open session next week, when the
question will be returned to the Folke
thing (or lower house), which has al
ready ratified' the treaty without , provid
ing for a plebiscite. A conference com
mittee will then be appointed, and it is
thought possible that this will eventually
result in the adoption of the report sub

A mere accident exposed the substitu
tion that was afterward practiced. Dep
uty United States Marshal George H.
Burnham was In the photograph gallery
in charge of a Chinese girl who was hav
ing her portrait taken. He saw the real
Mah Foo in Duffy's custody sitting for
his photograph. A short time thereafter
Burnham returned to the Marshal's of
fice and saw an old, decrepid Chinaman
sitting in the prisoners' room. He was
informed that this old manâ the John Doe
of â¢ the Btory â was Mah Foo, and he was
shown the photograph of John Doe af
fixed to the writ of - habeas corpus. Both
Burnham and Blackburn swore on the
stand yesterday that the prisoner was
not the Mah Foo who arrived on the
Coptic, who was placed in chaTge of
Duffy and who sat for his picture in the
photograph gallery. -
No evidence was introduced for the de
fense. John Doe was ordered to> appear
on Saturday morning for sentence.
; The story, as told by the witnesses, was
to the following effect; On the steam
ship Coptic, which arrived July 26, 1901,
came a coolie named Mah Foo in transit
to the City of . Mexico. . Customs Col
lector Stratton suspected that Mah Foo
intended to subsequently cross the bor
der Into the United States, and he â¢ ac
cordingly denied Mah Foo's petition to
be allowed to pass through this country.
A writ "of habeas corpus was issued Jan
uary 30 of -this year, and, in pursuance
of the. writ. Mason S. Blackburn, Gov
ernment watchman at the Chinese de
tention shed on the Mail dock, turned
over the genuine â¢ Mah Foo- to Express

gallery for his portrait, and thence to

be in readiness to rejoin the colors, and
gendarmes, of all the divisions are held
in instant readiness to march wherever re
quired.
In the Chamber of Deputies to-day M.
Furnemont, Socialist, save notice .of his
intention to interpellate the Government
on what he termed a "gross breach of in
ternational hospitality" in expelling the
Spanish deputies.
The smashing of windows, revolver fir
ing and other disorders continued
throughout the evening. A crowd of riot
ers marching toward the suburb of
Schaerbeek drove three policemen into it
cafe. The rioters looted this cafe and
wounded all three of the policemen by
revolver shots. Reinforcements of gen
darmes have been sent to Schaerbeek.
A thousand Socialists to-night attended
a meeting at the Maison du Peuple and
afterward marched to Sentin street,
where they stonedi the house of a Cath
olic deputy. The police. charged the riot
ers with drawn swords. Several of the
latter were severely injured and twenty
were arrested.
The Socialists had collected at the rail
road station to bid farewell to the mem
bers of a delegation of cjpanisn republican
deputies wno had attended the riocialist
gatherings here, and wno had partici
pated in last nignt's demonstration. Tne
police this morning informed the Span
iards that they must leave UrusseiS forth
with, and the delegates were escorted to
the station by a large gathering of So
cialists bearing red Hags. Tne King hap
pened to arrive at tne same time and
nad difficulty in getting his automobile
out of the crowd, but he finally found
an opening and passed his pursuers.
BRUSSELS, April 9.â King Leopold was
mobbed by Socialists this afternoon on
his arrival here from Biarritz. The meet
ing- between the Socialists and the King
was quite accidental, but it was none the
less unpleasant for his Majesty, whose
automobile was surrounded by excited So
cialists, who shouted, "Long live, the
republic," -"Long live universal suffrage,"
and waved red nags in the -King's face.

FOOD DOES IT.
Restores Health More Surely Than
Any Medicine.
It is a short road to trouble when the
food does not supply the right material
to rebuild the brain. You cannot use the
brain without breaking down small parti-
cles every day, and you cannot rebuild
unless the food furnishes the right kind
of building material, and that is albumen
and phosphate Of potash. "Not such as
you get from the druggist, but such its
nature stores In certain kinds of food.
Grape-Nuts contains these particles and
â¢well-defined results can be obtained from
using the toothsome, delicious food.
A brain worker whose name can 1)9
given by the Postum Co.. Battle Creek,
Mich., writes: "Last fall I got In a des-
perate condition through excessive men-
tal work and lack of proper food. I was
finally compelled to abandon all business
and sefk absolute quiet and rest In the
country.
"I had been under the care of a good
physician for several months, but it
eÂ«:med my food did not rebuild the brain
tissue properly. I was on the verge of
despair when I left for the country.
"Down at the ferry I purchased an
evening Journal and my attention was at-
tracted to the headlines of a Grape-Nuts
advertisement, which read, 'Food Cure
Nature'e Way.' I read it carefully and
decided to give Grape-Nuts a trial, so
next morning I went In on the, new food
end in two weeks' time Rained ttn
pounds and felt like a new man all over.
"I candidly believe if I .had known the
remarkable sustaining power of the food
prior to my illness I would hot have
needed a physician nor would ' I have
been eick at all." BBBBTHE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 1902,

TION OF "THE CARDINAL,"/AND LEADING LADY IN THE JAP
ANESE TRAGEDY THAT HAS BEEN. REVIVED' WITH SUCCESS.
ALLEGES CARELESSNESS. â Eliza Nealon
is suing: Dr. Martin Krotoszyner for $15,500
damages for Injuries sustained, she alleges,
through the careless treatment of an Injury to
one of her fingers.
Mrs. Edwards was 22 years of age, and
had one child, aged 4. She left her hus
band, a teamster, a year ago.
Mrs. Edwards was at dinner with
frineds Tuesday night. She got home at
11 o'clock and yesterday morning was
found to be very ill, and at 10 o'clock she
died. At first it was supposed that the
beating had caused her death and Mrs.
Epinger was at once taken In custody
by the police. The autopsy, however,
showed death to have ensued from acute
congestion of the lungs, liver and kid
neys, due to alcoholism. Bruises were
found on the back of the head, but they
did not indicate blows of sufficient force
to cause death.
The two women, Angell and William
Bush, a plumber, spent Sunday afternoon
drinking together. Mrs. Edwards showed
too 'much attention to Angell to please
Mrs. Epinger. About 8 o'clock Angell left
the room for a moment ana Mrs. Ed
wards followed him out. Mrs. Epinger
hurried after them and in a jealous rage
seized a cane and beat the younger and
comelier woman over the head and
shoulders.
Mrs. Margaret Edwards, a young
woman who lived in a lodging-house at
Â£29 Howard street, died ysterday- morn
ing under suspicious circumstances, and
Mrs. Jane Epinger, who lives at' the same
house, was arrested and will probably be
held .until after the inquest. Mrs. Ep
inger gave Mrs. Edwards a severe beat
ing with a cane Sunday evening as a re
sult of a quarrel over Harry Angell, a
photographer's solicitor, who also has
lived at fc29 Howard street.

Knight had not concluded his argument
at noon. He resumed in the afternoon,
and the proceedings were enlivened, by an
exchange of repartee between jiimself
and McNab. , Meyer | Jacobs and'W. G.
Zeigler addressed themselves to the legal
propositions involved in the several 'mo
tions. . ; ' . .
Garret McEnerney opened the argu
ment for' the deposed board. After ad
vising- Judge Sloss to be careful, in his
Judgment and not. to let the law of force
â¢prevail, , he presented his case In a state
ment, quoting the authorities he Intended
to cite. -His statement was as follows:
' Firstâ Proceedings by injunction may . be
properly used to protect the possession of of
ncea de facto against interference of claimants
whose title is. disputed until the latter shall
establish their . title by the judicial proceeding
provided by law, which is quo warranto. â¢
Second â The plaintiffs were In possession of
the offices of- members of the Board of Health
at the time of the commencement of this action.
The office dees not consist of books, paper, fur
niture and rooms. If an. incumbent holds over
after his term has expired the new appointee
does not. become the Incumbent of the office
by I taking possession, either through force or
by strategy, of the books, papers, records and
rooms used. by the officers. The new appointee
has but one remedy, and that la the action of
quo warranto.
The argument = will - be - resumed this
morning at 10 o'clock.
George -A. Knight said he appeared at
the Instance of the Governor, the State
Board of Health and Mayor Schmitz "in
an endeavor to assist in wiping . out the
foul blot. put upon. the. fair name of San
Francisco by the Board of Health, which
Mayor Schmitz had removed for cause."
.Upon the phrase "for cause" he built his
argument; reading from the letter of
Mayor .', Schmitz to the deposed members
the scathing denunciation of their action
that" he gave as -the cause of their re
moval. ' . Â¦ . >â¢ ' . -
, Attorney .Ruef began the - argument,
speaking for nearly two hours. He con
tended that the right of .the' Mayor to
remove: an appointive officer was clearly
set forth 5 In the charter, â¢ which Â¦ he said
bore 'the -.same relation to the people of
San Francisco as - did the constitution cf
the State to the people of California. He
reviewed the history of the /appointment'
of the new Board of Health and claimed
that as the Mayor's action was both'
executive and ministerial a court had no
.right to review his actions in a case of
this; kind.' . . .
j â¢ Mayor Schmitz's appointees were repre
sented by A. Ruef, George A. Knight,
Meyer Jacobs and- W. G. Zeigler. rhe
deposed "bubonic" Board of Health was
represented =.: by Garret :McEnerney and
Gavin McNab.".. Quite a number of former
Labor - party candidates and politicians
were In Â» the courtroom : during the day.
