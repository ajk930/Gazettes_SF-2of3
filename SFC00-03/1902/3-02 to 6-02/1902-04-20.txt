If \ surmises that in ' nearly every

*f ;" be found a sewins machine, with
which the British soldier amuses himself
in his loneliness. "Above ' all things.
Tommy's heart loves a sewing machine."
Althongh he must know that he can never
succeed in getting it .home to England,
yet if he finds one on a. farm he wiH tow
it along with him. overburdened as he
already is. upon the march. Wherein the
exact fascination lies is a 'mystery, but
grizzled reservist and, callow. recruit' alike
cannot resist this . housewife's help." '

THE servers served, the waiters wait
ed upon â if ycu really Vam to know
what it^ is to be swell, go around to
the Walters'. Club and get a glimpse
of high life.
For the waiter is the man-about-town
that knows what's what. You can't fool
him on the real thing. He is usel to it, "
he sees it every day. He knows the airs
ar.d manners of the exclusive. He has
come in contact with them for so long
that he. couldn't help imitating them if'
he tried. Above all, he knows what good
. service is. and he intends to have it, in
his own club.
The Pacific Coast WalV-rs' Association
is the whole of it. It holds forth up on
Stockton street, number 413, in the old
house which Mrs. Peck built and Chris
Buckley bought and the Manhattan Ciub
or.ee hold its headquarters. The house still
holds its nose high in the air and' an
nounces itself as of the aristocracy of
architecture. The big rooms, with their
stretches of plate glass windows are the
same as ever: the bays -and alcoves that
hang out picturesquely above | the tbwri
are the same, and many of i the relics of.
former splendor remain.
There is 'the onyx mantel, for instance,
and the wor.derful carve-i peacock that
stands upon the nev/eli post. It is the
Earne peacock that the Mikado of Japan
presented to Chris Buckley once upon a
time. The gorgeous stained glass windows
remain with all the embjems enshrined In
them that the owner of the house had -
made according to his > liking and â¢ his
lodge. Some of the great silk-upholstered
chairs are there, and the velvet.carpete.
Oh. the waiters of San Francisco are -no
i cheap men. . . i
Kor. several years now this association
has been established, and since 1300 it has
made its headquarters j in the big, house
on Stockton street- When the house was
ojjened in 1300 a grand ball was given as a'
house-warming, and since then there have
been receptions and "ladies' days galore.
The association, was established on a
business basis, but the 'social side Of the.
thing has never been neglected. The wait
ers are only those from -swell restaurants;
c-!ubs and hotels, and they are a mighty
exacting lot when it comes to service..
For they employ their own servants.
Â«They have portere anfl bartenders who
have to . mind their p*& and <i's. They
know what it means to be waited upon
correctly, and. they insist that they shall'
have -the best' service in town. Â¦
So their porters toe the mark and their
bartenders mix drinks witti the precision
and laborious art with which Burne-Jones
mixes colors when waiters are the men
to be pleased.
The waiters do not live at their club, for
they cat where they work, and a good
many of them have homes. But except
for this the club lacks nothing of the com
pleteness of any other in town.
The association is a sort of employment
bureau from which men are sent out at
,e mon>ent*B notice to any private house

THE .SUNDAY CALL.
"Waiters' Club knows the real thing when
It comes to refreshments.
And the luxuries that the club enjoys
have to be paid for. . But that's another
story. -The waiter's salary varies from
$35 paid at the restaurants to $50 paid at
some of the clubs.i And the. secretary
said that some waiters ."make as much
as $10 a month on the side." And then he
requested that "the perquisites of the
poor, down-trodden waiter" should not be
further discussed, and so here the curtain
is drawn upon these perquisites. It ts
said that they are a touchy subject.
At any' rate, the San Francisco waiter
can afford to be in the swim.

Easy Lessons
in Whist.
As soon as they discovered what a gold
mine of opportunity American vaudeville
really Is they decided on a masterstroke
of true American enterprise. They cast
off all managerial restraint and :. deserted
Von Tiller. Managerial man was super
fluous anyway. They would have no more
of him. Hereafter they would conduct the
ballet themselves on the socialistic plan.
Â£Â« they appointed the oldest to act as
epokeswor.an and Interview theatrical
managers lor engagements. â¢ The result
was submit-. Â£. to a vote of the whole
ballet, and tie majority rulrs. It was a
daring thing to do, but the plan has
worked marvelously well for a year now.
After all the training of the Pony bal
let is a wondrous process. It is not al!
airy fairy poses and silk fleshings. If
you think It is. Just. try the little five
minute pose shown on the bottom of this
page. All that you have to do is to stand
perfectly still on one foot, raise the other
leg to a horizontal position and hold it
there with the foot pointed straight out
before you while you point a saucily
warning finger at your arched toes. This
win test your nerves. Simple, Isn't If
Bjefore you practice this very long you
will Jearn that the art of pointing a Dret
tlly arched foot is a study of years in
itself It is rarely brought to perfection
even in the Pony ballet for It requires
much assistance and long and caref uj
They are a clever lot these eight pretty
little English girls of the Pony ballet. The
name Itself sounds perfectly devilish. In
It are visions of tights and spangles, of
billows ajid billows of crinkly lace and
shimmering tarietan. of slender throats
and gleaming shoulders, of late suppers
and diamonds, rich gowns and. costly
equipages, of gay young suitors and
doddering old roues, and all the myste
rious allurements of the greenroom. Sad
ly disappointing though It may seem,
however, this popular tradition is as
much a myth to the eight pretty little
English girls of the Pony ballet as to any
one else.
Nevertheless the name fits them like a

years old nor more than five feet in

pounds, and yet they are all marvels of
strength, endurance, grace and agility.
It is because they are so very petite and
dainty and diminutive that they were
first called the Pony ballet. The name is
aptly expressive. They are as high-spir
ited and unmanageable as young colts,
and they like the name bo well that they
have had it copyrighted. And now, woe
unto the many imitators who have been
appropriating, not only their specialties,
but even the name itself.
Originally there were sixteen little Eng
lish girls in the Pony ballet, but for their
second engagement in America Lederer

BALANCING nimbly. on one snapely

time, while twisting the other in a
frou frou of snow-white lingerie,
the eight pretty little English girls
who make up the Pony ballet at the Or
pheuai this week are showing the fascin
ating result of the unique training they
have received from London's most famous
ballet master, Professor Von Tiller.
training. And now, wnlsper: Here Is the
success of the pretty little Ponies. They
train each other!,
One of them takes the foot of the .
dancer in both hands. Holding it by the
ankle with one hand, she bends the toes
down and back Into a perfect arch with
the other,' and then keeping it securely
in that position she twists the whole' leg â¢
from front to back witii . that peculiar
corkscrew motion that makes the ballet
dancer so fascinating in all her poses. '
When you have learned* that your ne'xt
lesson .will be high kicking. Doubtless
you may already be proficient In the art,
but It is not sufficient that you can kick
the chandeliers. It must be done without'
the least- sign of effort, as if the whole
body was made of rubber instead of flesh
and bone. The true test of the finished'
ballet dancer is .shown in this seeming
disjoint fid ness of#every limb. The Ponies
acquire Â¦ their skill" after methods pecu
liarly-their own.*.. â .
One of them seats herself upon the floor.
The other standing behind her as a body
brace stoops over her shoulder and taking
hold of her foot draws the leg straight
up in the air until the elrl on the floor is
closed up like a jack knife. Sounds easy,
doesn't it. Just try It and see.'. Wben

North and south take ten tricks.
Trick 1 North makes an unusual
but a sound second hand finesse. He can
readily count but one card against him
and that possibly in his' partner's hand.
South can read the distribution of spades
and holds an exceptional strong suit of
trumps and' fair protection in two other
suits. He seems to be justified in call-
Ing. It is patent to North that his part
ner has commenced a signal, and if East
should be calling there would still be a
low card unaccounted ; for. â¢ ""
At trick 2 East must go up with
king or lose a trick.^ ;
Trick â¢ 4 North has "â¢ trump 10 or none
remaining;, in the latter case South can
not do better than throw the lead to
East; making North; last player.
Trick â¢ 5 North must have spades
come up" through West, and may need his
queen of -club for re-entry. ,
West's discard cannot be read with the â¢
same precision as if he bad not already
declared strength In spades, still on prin
ciple, ought to indicate greater strength
in clubs than in diamonds, and so point to
the latter as South's probable suit.
Trick 9, North can safely discard a
club for his partner is marked with the
deuce of spades and another trump.
â¢ At trick 1, if North does not finesse but
plays. queen. South is In no â¢ way en->
lightened as to the distribution of spades
and is not justified in calling, and there
fore there will be a loss of twe> tricks in
the scors.

was about It. ";Â¦Â¦â¢"Â¦/Â¦Â¦"Â¦'..'Â¦ â¢ -.- ." ""â¢Â¦"'Â¦': Â¦Â¦
Something besides legislation! had 'to. be
done. . It should not be a question of "stop

eat.".
Then it was that science stepped In and
had something to say.' , The naturalists
found the "something Â¦ else" ' that would
save the day. . r
That something . was . ARTIFICIAL
PROPAGATION. . '
It was a simple matter of observation
to find that of all the millions of esss
from - spawning fish each , year, only 5: per
cent I of the . fertilized eggs ever hatched :
the rest became legitimate prey to all the
, other denizens of the water big enough to
gobble an egg. .All of this was': quite fine
for the eaters, but rather discouraging for
the embryo fish and for the hungry peo
ples of the earth waiting for a good Fri
day dinner. ,',. . - ; ,;Â¦';Â¦.Â¦Â¦ --..-.,,
The naturalists experimented with the
result that finally over 90 per cent of the
eggs handled by them could . . be easily
brought to the hatching point and a cor
respondingly large number of small fish
developed - r to a size ' and hardihood \ EufB

supply of the streams could f never be ex
hausted:; but ; civilisation Â«with its saw
mills to poison the .waters with their dust.
Its hydraulic mines to kill' with" their re
fuse and men to trap and slay with their
clever hands soon placed the fish : family
on the high road to destruction.
Then the people gradually awoke to the
fact that one of the State's most .valuable
food supplies was going "and the wheels
of the. law : began revolve.. Most; of -us

The ruthless hand of money-loving man,
actuated by his trained mind and assisted
by cunning devices of nets, traps and
giant powder, was in a fair jeay to crush
out all edible life of 'our streams and'
waters. Even the laws established. by our
wise heads, srho saw farther than the sun

It' was not enough to legislate against
nets and traps and powder and all whole-'

It was not enough to make a closed sea
son when no fish should be taken and of
fenders should be severely punished by
fine and imprisonment.
The matter finally resolved Itself "into
one of two things. Â¦,
Either stop - fishing altogether orâ do
something else! . - -
Just what that, '.'something" should be

fishing meant the loss of 'one of the
world's greatest free food supplies for
such a â¢ time as would I be necessary for
. the diminished numbers of fish to in

production.
Then It was quite plain also that even
after giving the fish an unmolested period
for propagation, this increased supply
would be caught out the moment the ban
was taken off. and then we should be in
as bad a fix as before. * , â¢ -

Â¦A salmon spawns about 5000 eggÂ»-quite

only 250 ever, hatch: the rest, as' they roll
around in their nest at the bottom of the
river, fall I an . easy food for everything
under water that has a mouth big enough
- to take them in. Those 230 have pass
through all. the dangers of orphanage, and
their chances of growing to two inches in
length are slim.- After they have'attain
ed that growth their prospects of ma
' turity become brighter. "-
At the best the salmon has but four
years to live.. "When four years old they.
", leave the salt water and go to fresh to
spawn. In the fresh i. water their stom
Â¦achs shrivel upâ why, no one knowsâ and
after they have brought their family into
. the world they soon die, practically from
starvation. With such odds against them
'the specks would. stand a poor chance for
escape, from extermination with such a
demand'on them as a food supply as there
now is unless nature were assisted by
artificial means. . Â¦:
The FJsh Commission supplies the arti
ficial â¢ means .that- proves the saving
clause.
Of the 5000 eggs taken from . a single
fish over 90 per. cent . Is returned to the
water in the shape of good, sturdy fish
two inches longâ well able to care for
/themselves. Up to that time their living
'has been provided for them and they get
back to their native element much fatter
and more rugged than their poor little
cousins^ who all this time have had to
rustle â and rustle hard.
Fortunately the habits i of the salmon
are such that it is an easy matter for
; science to co-operate with nature. â¢
When the spawning time comesâ in the
fall of the year and early springâ the flsh
rush pellmell from Â¦ the sea for j the^ head
â¢ waters of the rivers;- to find a, suitable
Â¦> place in the warm and shallow waters for
their nests. Â¦Â¦' Knowing this. fact, the com
-, - mission builds a rack, a sort' of fence, at
a suitable place across the stream. This
; resembles a picket fence with slats V&
- inches apart and braced to slant up
_ stream. '.The fish meeting this obstacle
:Â¦ remain there, heading stream and
making, a Â¦ vain attempt to get through.
'-Then a seine : is drawn from below the
rackviip to it and the fish- are captured In
.Â¦ large Those that are "rlpa"
are stripped at once and. the unripe onea

To facilitate the taking of the flsh the
. rack is 'provided with, traps. The trap is
simply a. -square Inclosure with vertically
placed slats, witK an -entrance similar to
.that of an ordinary pound net. The flsh

The salmon spawning stations for Cali
fornia have , been established at Baird. on
the'McCloud River, in Shasta County:
at Battle Creek, In Tehama County, and
at Mill Creek, in the same county, about
thirty miles from Battle Creek. The sta
tion at Baird was the first one established
here-in 1870, by Dr. Livingstone Stone.
The Government now attends to the
gathering of these eggs, and then they
are '^hipped to the hatcheries in charge
of the California State Fish Commission
ers.
A' box of salmon eggs ready for ship
ment is shown on this page. It is neces
sary to pack and handle them with the
greatest care, for while an egg can be
dropped from a height of fifteen or twenty
feet and still survive, yet the chances are
that 1 the* flsb will be a weakling or de
formed.
The great, bulk of the salmon eggs la
sent to the State hatchery at SIssan. the
largest hatchery in California, and undsr
the able superintendence of W. H. Sheb
ley.
Mr. Shebley has been actively engaged
In raising flsh" for over twenty years and
has been at the Sisson hatchery for the
last "eight years. To the uninitiated t:
seems little short of a marvel to watch
him at work on, the eggs during their deli
cate days of evolution. By years of ex
perience the' sense of touch and sight
must become so delicately trained that all
these thousands of egg3 ean be Â¦ daily in
spected to see if all progresses well and
if anything is found to be the matter
with them tp know exactly what it is
and how to remedy. It.
When the salmon eggs come in, then is
the. busy time" at Sisson. The main bulld-
ins consists of one immense room 120x3S
feet, and in it are placed the' hatching
troughs.' These troughs are built of two~
Inch lumber for sides and bottom and are
sixteen feet long, sixteen inches wide and
six inches deep. -For ! convenience they
are made in pairs and arranged so that
the water from .one pair can flow into
the other. These two make what i3 called
a "section.'* and In the building at Sis
Â¦ jSp'ii there are twenty-one sectionsâgiv
ing a total of , eighty-four troughs. When
busy days come to the hatchery there are ,
aÂ« many as 10,000,000 fish in the building
In varying stages of development, from
the . newly fertilized eggs to "the sturdy
little swimmer .of. two months old and
rcjxdy for the ponds outsideâ quite a baby
f&rm. . ' . .
In each trough are. placed six portable
hatching baskets that have the appear
â¢ arcs y. of wire - boxe? twenty- two inches
long, fifteen inches wide. and five and a
half inches deep. These' have a capacity
of about 25.000 salmon eggs or 30,000 trout
eggs each.
"As soon as the egg3 are brought in they

they are ready for distribution and to do

Go to the Sisson hatchery and in busy

of the building and frys ready for the

are egrgs and alevins in every stage of
evolution. The work at this time is very
severe. All the ergs and fish must be
carefully watched and tested lest some

ease among the eggs is threefold: First,
from microbes that may. have been car

mucus from the body of the parent fish
during the stripping process; second, mi
crobes and bacteria possibly in the water
used by the hatchery, and third, mal
formations or death from accidents, such
as handling the fish during a delicate
period of propagation.
Aside from this worry there is the con

and washed at the Cottonwood River staÂ«
tion the eggs .are placed in"one v of thÂ«
" ls.rge': shipping cans and sent to the Sis
son hatchery, where they are hatched and
finally, distributed as husky little trout
Â¦ vherever called for. Even the eggs in
this state must be conscientiously .cared
_ for while making the sixty-mile train run
necessary to land them at Siason. Every
few. minutes the, cans must.be aerated us
in the rules mentioned in shipping ftah.
The Sisson hatchery is the largest in the
'Â¦State and nine ponds have been estab
lished there with the object of ultimately
having a fine trout brood faim At pres
ent the home brood stock amounts co
about 70CO fish of different varieties. Many
of the trout are now. large enough to strip
and are doing their best to help stock the
wtters of California.."
These flsh are fed on a mixture of mush
and " pulverized beef livers, the mush be
ing made, of boiled shorts and flour. Twice
a day they receive their rations, and in
the pond where the large ones are kept
-it is a sight worth seeing to watch tha
3 great fellows tearing through the clear
water to get their shareâ and the other
fellow's,' too. if they can. They are all aa
fat as stall-fed cattle and look in tha
pink. of condition; from actual results it
has been demonstrated that .the young
fish from the, eggs of the home brood
stcck " are superior tb those propagated
from the captured fish, and therefore the
farm 'will be : regularly enlarged so. that
eventually; it "may.be possible '.to' supply
the demand for small fish -entirely from
a choice . stock of special*breeders., TherÂ«s
Is a marked difference between the eggs
of these fish and the captured spawn. Those
from the wild fish are red, while the eggs
. from the Sisson farm show almost clear
white. The reason for this is explained
. by the presence of a small shellfish en
joyed by the trout of the rivers that Is
not on the menu card of the Sisson aris
tocrats. Â¦
* ": This brood farm affords a splendid op
portunity for the close study and habits
.. of the different breeds. During th&spawn
"inc season the .males are all ' cross and
pugnacious and will fight for hours. tear T
ing off fins and pieces of flesh. Jhe flns

The fish hatcheries are doing a great
work for Californiaâ much greater than la
generally realized. They are stocking the
waters of the State with free food for all
' where there soon would be : nothing but
barrenness were nature ; not- assisted.

"Give size of stream or lake," and so on
for a list of twenty questions necessary
to give the Commissioners an exact un
derstanding of the merits and possibilities
of the application. Thousands upon thou
sands of fish are distributed each year to
such applicants," as it all helps to get our
public streams and waters well - stocked
Â¦with one of the most delicate . and nour- '
iihing .food* known to man.
One man Is sent with every shipment;',
and it is his' duty to keep the .fish alive
and healthy. His flsh are swimming
about in great cans that 'will hold from
&000 to SQOO young salmon or from 8000 to
10.000 trout. Here are hisofficial.instruc
tions, which will give an idea of how
much time the shipper has for recreation
or sleep on a trip:
"Keep the temperature of the water
in the cans between 40 and 50 degrees.
Take the temperature every thirty min
utes. Place the ice in the cans carefully.
Do not drop it in. In moderately warm
v.eather six to eight pounds of ice to the
can will hold the temperature for an
hour. . Aerate the water in the cans by
feeding and cleanliness. " Every day tha
troughs are cleaned and the egg baskets
brushed free of slime and refuse by care
fully manipulated feathers. Twice a year
everything is disinfected* and painted..
"There is everything to be, learned by
experience, and consequently the most ac
curate accounts are kept of ; temperature,
thÂ«> condition of flsh and eggs and the' ".
number lost. All these can , be, referred
to at^ny future date to ascertain causes;
of failure .or success.
-After the fish are hatched and, have be
come large enough frys to" stand an ever. Â¦
chance for life with their cousins of the
outer world there comes the delicate mat- ;
ter of transportation. In some cases it Â¦
requires a journey of three, days by rail
before they will reach their destination,
and during that time the frys must be
handled with the greatest care.' ,'
GREATEST FREE FOOD SUPPLY
All th* little kickers. Just evoluting from
â¬^g.=. are provided with a yolk-sacâ
plainly visible to the eyeâ which is a full
dinner pail presented to them by their
mothers. This keeps them alive until they
are mere hardy and better able to care
for themselves. So long as It lasts they
are called "alevins." For days and days
the elevins do nothing but herd together
at the bottom of the trough, live off their
yolk-sac keep their little noses pointed up
current and wonder what it is all about.
By and by, at the end of from twenty to
forty days, according to the temperature,
they find their supply of provisions about
gone, their strength increased and their
inherited tendencies beginning to show
themselves.
Seven days later a small circle Is seen
around the spot, whether the, egg be im
pregnated or not, and the , two are so
much alike at this stage that tlje naked
eye cannot distinguish which are fecun
dated. When nine day3 old. the circle of
the impregnated egg has enlarged, a
slight brownish or bluish gray tinge per
vading the interior; while the unimpreg
nated remains the same. Or. course, the
expert of to-day is able to. tell, by sclen- Â¦
tine tests, the matter of fertility from the
twelfth hour, but the above is the egg
as it appears to the uninitiated.
The unimpregnated eggs never change
after the ninth day and are as easily
distinguished from the fecundated ova as
a few white beads would be if scattered
among those of transparent glass..
On the eleventh day the first forma
tion of the fish can be seenâ that is. if the
temperature up to this point has averaged
4S degrees. We now observe a brown line,
extending from the circumference toward
the center of the circle, which now cov
ers one-third of the egg.
When twelve days old the circle covers
one-half of the egg; on the thirteenth
day it has passed three-quarters around
the egg and on the fourteenth day it has
pone entirely around and the young trout
is formed. By the twenty-fifth day the
eyes, heart, arteries, red blood, circula
tion of blood and motion will be observed.
At this period the embryo tish are hardy
enough to be shipped to any part of the
United States, or even farther, if proper
care is taken with them en route. At this
stage they are said to be "eyed," a term
quite evident to itself from the fact that
the two eyes of the fish are prominently
visible. t 1 -"
Continuing the process of hatching, the
trout, at this temperature of 4S, degrees,
begin to come out of their shells at about
the fiftieth day.
The Sisson ms Â¦â¢hinery uses the -wire bas
kets, previous described, a California
Invention that at displaced the old style
trays for hatching the_efcgs.
When these eggs begin to hatch is that
period most interesting to the casual ob
server. At the hatchery during this
month can be seen thousands upon thou
sands of our future rainbow trout, kick
ing off their shells and struggling Into
the' tadpole stage'. The opening in the
wire mesh, upon which rest the eggs, are
rectangular and hold the round eggs; but
when the long tadpole-formed future trout
kicks himself free from his shell he eas
ily slips through the mesh and into the
bottom of the trougrh.
In a few hours after the spawn is taken
there is a small light brown spot the size
of a pin to be seen on the top of the egg,
whether it is impregnated or not. No
matter how ycu' turn -the. egg, this Epot
will always rise to the top. This is the
jrerrn where impregnation takes place.
into all tJie details cf hatching the eggs
would fill volumes, so we must content
ourselves with but a brief- decription:
The time required fcr hatching depends .
mainly upon the temperature. .Taking,
for example, the rainbow, trout eggs, it
has been found that as. a general rule
they will hatch in .water at 50 degrees in
frora forty-two' to forty-live days, Â¦ each
degree colder taking five days longer and
each desrree warmer live days less; the
difftrence increases as the temperature
falls and decreases as it rises. The same
rules apply, approximately, to salmon as
well. .

My talkative friend after a half hour

was purely experimental. I wanted him

"Which I concedes as much!" he re

got-siii will Increase after - Mr. Willard's
big repertoire performance next week at
the Columbia, for it will try his voice to
the utmost.' , ; - Â¦
WHATEVER their jealousies, ac
tor folk are quick to reCagnlzc
and quicker to imitate the art
of a rival. Any new "trick of
voice or gait cr gesture that
makes for success is sure to be copied Jn- X
stantly, whether it be of the old or the
new school of acting. And apropos of this
little proclivity of the actor folk there i*>
much discussion just now of E. S. Wil
lsud's voice. He is admHtfd to be a con
summate master of elocution. The shad
ins; of his tonr-s is as perfect as the gra
dations of a finely tuned instrument, and
â¢the gesture that accompanies each 8pe?ch
Is calculated to heighten the effect- Tlii.j'
is particularly true of his acting iv. "The
Cardinal." As a KUpremc test of his talent
it is eaid that he could act the whole play
in the dark and reveal every shade of
emotion so perfectly with his voice alone
that not a single scene would lose any of
!ts intense dramatic force.
And the influence of. his art on those
who waieh him act, and particiTlariy those
who play with him. Is best shown in the
acting of his leading lady, JIlss lilltu
O'Malley, the Irish actress. She has
caught all his tones, even to the musical

prised by this greenroom gossip. For In
stance, there^ls pretty" Lillian Elliott of
the. Alcazar company.
"My ambition," she says, "is '-not so
much to be great as it is to be happy. To
be both, of course, would be a consumma
tion devoutly to be wished; but I would
rather be happy without the greatness
than great without .the "happiness. I

. Â»-
And in contrast to the popular r notf on of
the' long and. difficult read that mxiit be
traversed to fame, the actor folk are fond
of dwelling on the element ' of luck.
Greenroom gossip has much to say. of
how kind Fate has been to Edythe Chap
man, the c!ever leading lady of the Xeill
company, which is just opening its season
at the California Theater. A few years
ago she was a super with Warde and
James in Cleveland, Ohio. Her earnest
ness impressed Sir. "Warde on the very
first night. ' Before the week was over
the leading lady became ill. There was
no understudy, and the stage manager
was distraught. Miss Chapman asked for
the part. She was laughed at. The audac
ity of a super -with only a week's expe
rience was beyond belief. Mr. Warde.
however, gave her a rehearsal. Mis3
Chapman was leading lady next day. The
play was "Frencesca di Remini."
â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢
Of course, apropos of ambition, gossip
naturally leads to talk of stage fright.
Agnes Ranken of the Central Theater
says: "My first case of stage fright
wasn't on the stage at all. but in the Con
vent of Notre Dame in this city. It was
the commencement day exercises. Dressed
as a gypsy maid, which was In Itself

hearsed every line and gesture of >my

the platform littered with flowera and

heard the applause that followed the an
nouncement of my name I was stricken
with terror. I rushed to my room and
locked myself In. I've got over It since
then, however.
"Fiddle Dee Dee" is a great success at
Fischer's Theater, but there -has been
much gossip over Maude Amber's much
heralded rivalry of Lillian Russell's fame
and beauty. Miss Amber Is a soprano of
statuesque proportions and totally unlike
Lillian Russell, for all. that is said of her
svperior beauty. She sang in the same
company, however, and is virtually a
child of the stage, for she has been sing

made to Lillian Russell she has a difficult

GREEN-ROOM GOSSIP OF THE ACTOR FOLKbeginning of the nineteenth century, "I
would never stop exercising: with my arms
until I had filled out." .'
Massage, with the system of rubbing in
the oils and ointments, was unknown in
those days, but the old beauty culturist
knew that in exercise lay muscle, and he
sought to build up the bust by muscular
exercise and ln.no other way.
We, of. better.' day and generation, com
bine the two â exercise and massage. And
we also combine medication and diet in
one harmonious whole, which, taken al
together, will give a good bust.
1 As the Goddess of Liberty.
Take the pose which is called by the
physical culturists "the Goddess of Lib
erty pose." A Â¦weight is taken in the
hand and the arm Is stretched to the lim
it above the head, precisely as Miss Lib
erty holds the torch down New York har-.
bor.
The weight is lowered*and lifted again
until the arm feels fatigued. Then the
subject rests. Something has been done
toward bust development.
Another exercise is that of stretching
the arm out at the Eide, a very fatiguing
motion. A weight is held' in- the hand.
A certain opera singer who was narrow
in the chest rubbed each nigrht a handful
of cocoa oil Into her flesh. The massage.
the oil and the exercise did the work.
Usually the exercise of singing will
round out the chest and vocallsm is one of
the surest ways to gret a full bust. Sing
ers are nearly always fat In the bust, and
this Is attributed to vocal exercises. â¢
But all cannot sing; and for those who
cannot sing it ia not a pleasant practice.
There must be other methods adopted, for
the bust must be shaped.
The flat bust is the one feature that Is
never pretty. It Is contrary to the set
laws of nature and It is something that
invariably fails of grace.
On the other hand the round full bust Is
Practice Singing.
THE plaint that comes from one
reader Â«tfll be echoed by many,
How to accuire a good bust is
eomeihlng which has puzzled all
women since the days of Venus, of
whom the legends tell us that she
was so beautifully rounded that none
could look upon her without loving her.
It Is singular how much a good form
has to do with love. You may be very
fend of a dear one who is 111-shapen, but
with how much pride and glow do you
look upon the one who is nicely formed. â
The flat-chested, narrow-breasted wo
man may have all the virtues of the deca
| logue, yet somehow you cannot admire
her as though she were properly shaped.
It is a wonder that the flat-busted wo
man does not obtain shape. ; She may
even do something with artifice, but this
Is, as a rule, so very apparent that It
deceives no one.
Just try turning up the corners of the
mouth, regardless of your mood, and
see how it makes you feel. Then draw
the corners of your mouth down, and
you will declare that there is something
In it, and is it not worth an effort to
change frowns and sullenness and de
spondency for smiles and contentment
and a happy heart?
"Regardless of the mood that may
possess me, when I get up in the morn
ing, I first 'devitalize' my face; that Is,
cast out the unlovelv expression in pos

it to work wonders in most unpromising
cases."

"How do I manage it," you ask, to keep
the corners of fny mouth turned up?"
TO DEVELOP
THE BUST.
"My supreme desire â to quote eome one,
perhaps it's Homerâ we'll say it's Homer
â is not to be learned, rich, famous or

"For example," she cries, springing
erect from the low, luxurious divan on

a little what it is to be sad. Observe now

and bends her head until she presents a
picture of gentle dejection.

Melancholy and beauty cannot exist to
gether Is Isabella's theory. "I never once
permit myself to fall into a fit of thfc
blues."
She considers it positively rude to her
family, as well as unkind, to appear at
the breakfast table in what may be called
facial dishabille. Most every one considers
her morning toilet complete when she has
done with tub and dumbbells, dressed her
hair and put on her clothes, yet no woman
should ever venture beyond the threshold
of her bedroom until she has coaxed a
smooth and smiling reflection in her mir
ror.
"I would as soon think of leaving
my room in the morning before putting
on my dress." she says, "as before put
ting on my face."

The greatest benefactor of the century
is that periodical which not long ago
opened a smiling contest through its col
umns and offered prizes for smiles.
Every one who could make the first
semblance of a smile hastened to the
photographer's to smile for the contest.
Men and women who had forgotten how
to smile stood before their mirrors and
practiced. Men who met each other on
the street paused long, enough to say.
"Let us smile," and disappeared behind
glass doors. Each contestant smiled \ for
the pure joy of smiling. Giggles and
laughs counted as smiles, and a large
number of smirks and grins, masquerad-

are positively beneficial." For one thing,
by the muscular exercise involved the
blood pressure to the brain is much re
duced; this would seem to make in
favor of what is known as "a good cry."
But let this good, cry be only occasional,
once a year say, or once in two years.
Feminine tears have rather gone out
of fashion, or fallen into disfavor. A
century ago It was different.
Heroinesâ then wept for hours and for
whole days; or even, on and off, for a
week, and all about trifles. They all cried
so. beautifully," tooâ slow crystal, tears
from reddened eyelids. It was charming
â in a novel. To have emotions may be
the fashion, and amusing enough, but
they ruin one's good looks. "No emotions,
no wrinkles," Is an old beauty recipe.
Smiles would seem to be preferable for
everyday life, for when the spirits arÂ»
serene and buoyant the body is not only
healthiest but most beautiful.
It is a sad fact that attractive color
ing. and a 'satiny, texture of skin mean
â¢ infinitely more to .the ordinary run of
women than do '. the- stories" their faces
are weaving from "moods and
; and j habits. '

somewhat "fade. Let us bear in mind the

you first get up in the morning, the last

prescription of the doctor who makes a
specialty of nervous disorders. To his
half a hundred or more melanchaly pa
tients this is the prescription;
"Keep the corners of your mouth turned
up and you can't feel blue." The direc
tions for taking are: "Smileâ keep on
smilingâ don't stop smiling." (The doc
tor treats his patients to medicine when
necessary, but when the case is one of
pure melancholy, without bodily ill. he
simply recommends the smile cure. He
has the patient remain in his office and
smile, If it is not the genuine article it
must, at least, be an upward curvature
of the corners of the mouth, and the
better feelings follow inevitably. It
takes considerable patience to induce
some of the patients to apply the cure,
and, of course, the greater number of
patients are women, for when a man is
blue . he is bound to be blue, in spite of
everything, but a woman- is more easily
persuaded to try to find a cure.

not be so apparent if the summer ward

It is really possible to make a very nice
seashore selection and it is well worth
one's while to give the matter study be

Traveling dresses are to be almost or
nate for the_orthodox ideas of good form
The severity of the tailored gown Is lack-
Ing,'' but In its, place has come a gown so
pretty that one doea not regret tho
change. Beautiful" black silk, with bro
caded figures, looking very much like rich
brocaded silk,, but being in reality a cloth,
with a silky texture, is made up Into a
traveling gown of approved type. .
Thougrh, speaking of corsets, it may be
Bald that the bathing corset is a good
thing. It is maVJe of plain white canvas
with a few bones In it and a good stout
lace at the back, which may or may not
be. tied tightly. It holds up the figure,
supports the back, and. If one Is accus
tomed to a corset, it is better on than off.
The dire backache and the lassitude
vnlch follow sea bathing can frequently
be traced to the fact that the bather takes
off her support and then takes the most
violent exercise of her life, battling with
the waves of the deep sea. There come
â¢ bathing corsets this year in many shades
of pink and blue, yellow and florid goods.
The bathing dress of the season can be
made of flannelâ if you like flannel. It Is
always fashionable. This material now
conies with a. (smooth surface, a sort of
mercerized finish and is the best of a.,
bathing etufls, if you can wear such a
heavy garment. :
Your Bathing Suit.
Flannel, you must remember, absorbs
the water and becomes like lead after a
few minutes In the waves. It Is good for
the practical swimmer who stays under
the water. But for the girl who disports
In the waves awhile, then comes ashore
and races on the sand, it is not ro goou,
for It is too heavy. For those who have
rheumatism or kindred ailments or who
are reducing, it is the stuff ideal and for
the long-distance swimmer.
There is a cashmere which comes this
year for bathing suits. It is light yet
f nrm, and has been shrunk. It is very soft
' and will answer p.lso for a sand suit.
A eand suit is one in which the wearer
lies on the shore, digs In the beach and
does everything but tjo into the water.
Wash&ble silk Is the ideal sand suit ma
terial, and can be exquisitely made up.
Last year the pretty maiden of "Floro
dora" had sand suits of wash silk, in blue
and in red, in black and in white. And
In these they went to Manhattan Beach
and defied the Johnnies to mash them.
The suits were made up with knickers a
little longer than the skirt, which was
very short, indeed. .
The bathing dress has knickerbockers
under it, but it is not considered just the
Â¦proper thing to have them show. There
be these who like to show the trousers,
but, as a rule, you will fino" that this is
not liked at the seashore, nor is it correct
when cycling. There is something too
suggestive about the trouser to please all.
The new bathing suits in serge show
beautiful effects. Many of them are
trimmed with a very light weight serge of
quite a different color, to make a sharp
contrast.
A suit now being made for Newportâ
for the season begins early this year
shows the regulation shade of navy blue
~-Â«erge, trimmed with a wide band of coffee
serge.
This band is four inches wide if an

The sunbonnet girl of summer will soon
be here/ but of all the varieties of . sun
bonnet girls none is prettier or more at
tractive than the one who wears her
stiffly starched bonnet to the seashore
and takes it to the beach with her when
she troes bathing. .
To make a sunbonnet Is not difficult,
xake enough cotton material, which may
be plain or printed, to go over the head.
It must not quite meet under the chin.
Cut this piece j in oblong shape, with
square corners, and line it and stitch It,
trimming it as you please with tucks or
ruffles.
ihe two young women to wjiom It is
given the credit of having started the
sunbonnets as a summer girl ornament
and article of. wearing apparel are Doro
thy Whitney and Giadys Vanderbllt.
The sunbonnet is quite an ideal thing
for the bathing girl. True, she cannot go
into the water with it on, but she can
wear it; over her oilskin cap; arid when
she gets ready for her plunge she can
take off the bonnet and lay It on the
sands. Once out of the water she can
put it on again. It affords a protection
from the sun and Is immensely becoming
to a pretty face. '
The sunbonnet girl will be seen at the
seashore. She will wear a little bonnet of
lawn, beautifully white or gently pink,
and the front or brim will be of stlffene'd
muslin, corded and stitched to make it
keep its shape. Into the back or baggy
crown her hair will be bundled.
Two Sunbonnets.
The open worked stockings, black, are
to be worn In bathing and the slip-stltch
and open stripes. All sorts of stockings,
thin enough to display the flesh color,
will be ,worn and the vogue for. them
will be even greater than it was last
season.
Where stockings. only are worn without
shoes a little innocent deception is prac
ticed. Soles, the heavy insole variety, are
passed Inside the stocking to form a sup
port and protection for the- feet. Into
these my lady puts her dainty foot and
the effect is very delicate and pretty. She
is standing in her daintily neat silk stock
ings upon the pebbly beach, but she does
not suffer from the pebbles, though no
one can understand her intrepidity as she
runs over the sands stocking- footed.
The bottom of the sandal Is a heavy felt
sole, a little larger than the foot, so as to
protect each toe. .Then white satin rib
bon or heavy white braid is banded
around the foot and ankle until the san
dal is made fast to the foot. There is a
distinct knack In sandal making which
must be practiced before one can become
an expert.
The white sandal will be popular. This
is a classic covering for the feet and is
worn over the black silk stocking.
Mrs. Varf Rensselaer Cruger is expected
at Newport this summer. This literary
bather defies the breakers in black silk,
trimmed with white.
A bathing suit, also intended for New
port, is for a widow in her weeds. It is
in rough serge, to look like a deep mourn
ing color. Then around the bottom of the
skirt comes a wonderful trimming of
white serge, light weight. A strip of serge
six inches wide is passed around the skirt
and knotted at frequent intervals yto

is a jelt of serge, which hangs down at
one side like a Highlander's sash.

Tet whole taffeta dresses are being

ored taffeta, in a dark shade, was made
up in very fashionable design, with a
basque with a little frill . around the
waist, and with a skirt with three ruf
fles around the foot, one above the other,
each a little narrower than the one below

The waist may be finished with a stiff
elastic, which Is, after all. the best way
to finish a blouse' waist. A strong hook
holds it in the front. If a different finish

The Russian fancy for wearing a blouse
as a coat is a growing one. The mus tn
or silk shirt waist is worn by the summer
girl. But over it there is slipped a silk
blouse, which buttons down the front
and ties at the low square neck with a
big satin ribbon bow.
The new blouse sleeve Is very baggy
between the elbow and the wrist, wnÂ»le
at the wrist it is brought in and fitted tnr
a very tight, small, narrow cuff. The
contrast between the bagginess of ths
lower arm and the tight cuff is very pro
nounced and pretty.
The blouse is cut rounding in the necK

is xnt square^ and finishtd with a sailor
coflar. It is a very becoming thing, and

possible, the object being to secure length

which is necessary, if one would be well

New Ideas.
New Ideas are as plentiful as spring
flowers. A very new thing is the hou^e
belt. This consists of a wide girdle of
blucic satin. It is fastened with a brilliant
buckle, which is hooked at one aide.
Upon the other side there Is another
buckle to match. The idea is that wich
a blouse waist, all basajy in front, th-;
buckle is .hidden and the proper place for
it. therefore. Is upon the side.

up with taffeta for dancing; all are Ion;;
and all on the order known as fluffy.
Scrne are lace trimmed, others chiffon
flounced.
One description will suffice. A gown of
turquoise blue French broadcloth was
maae with the closest of skirts and a
waist that showed a very pretty blouse
effect.
The chemisette was in geranium colored
silk and there were cuiis. turn over in
shape, of geranium. Around the foot
there was a- I flare flounce in the tur
quoise blue cloth, headed with a stitcueil
band of geranium, -while geranium lined
the flounce. Â¦
A hat of burnt straw was trimmed with
geranium flowers and blue bows. At' the
belt was worn a cnou of blue and tan
and turquoise, but the belt proper con
sisted of a wide band of blacK satin.

.*Country living will be the fad and the
summer gowns will be built for house
parties and outdoor amusements of all
kinds and for small dances.
For summer wear there is a combina
tion that la struggling for recognition. It
has the indorsement of our French cous
ins, but! is not yet folly liked here. H
is that of mixing geranium red and ligla
turquoise blue in such a manner and so
freely that whole costumes are in theje
two colors.
It is time to get ready the traveling
suit, for the outing days are here. Things
have come to such a pass now that one
can take a vacation at any time an=l
find one's self in fashionable company;
and there are summer resort3 in winter

criticism from the old-time view, for it
is very long. A so-called Newport trav
eling gown ia in black brocaded cloth,
witb sweeping train and very plain. It
id cut perfectly plain, and a shirt
waist is to be worn with it. For a coat,
there is a blouse of black satin cloth,
very full and loose and with a de^p
pallor collar.
Another style of traveling dress is cut
on the pedestrian order, with Bkirt of
ankle leneth, and blouse waist. It is
trimmed with stitched bands of black
cloth, the suit Itself being castor gray.
With the gray and black there must be
a touch of scarlet, which is provided in
the brilliant velvet pompon which trims
the tailored hat.
The mountain suit is worn for travel
ing, and, if it be ctf gray, can be used as
a general utility, gown by the woman
who does not want to be burdened with
too many suits of this kind. Its skirt
is too snug for cycling, but for traveling
purposes and out-of-door expeditions of
all kinds one suit can be made to 3o
duty.
A general utility suit of this variety Is
in nickel gray cloth, trimmed with blue.
There is a fold of black silk along each
edge of the blue band to set off the blue
and. to hold It from the gray. This really
makes a very nice trimming, and can be
recommended aa one which comes from
Paris. Black 'braid bordered with a fold
of light blue looks very well upon gray.
"White braid, silky and lustrous, can be
edged with poppy-colored red and used
to trim brown and some shades of dark
blue. There is a color scheme in all the
traveling gowns, and one must not ba
blind to it.
Rsadv-to-Wear Hats.
There are a great many ready-to-wear
straw hats that are exactly .adapted to
the seashore. Made of satin straw, op^n
Another excellent beach hat has a top
covered with very dark green rose leaves.
The brim is edged with tiny roses and
there is a bunch of them directly at the
back of the hat where it is turned up.
Leaves of the rose are set hack of the
roses, and there is a wilderness of them.
So inexpensive is the small silk bolero
that you can have one of ptaln. white taf
leta, tucked or stitched, and one of black,
lined with white. The navy blue satin
one is not 'an expensive article and the
tan colored liberty s.lk bolero is so use
ful to wear with the shirt waist for
traveling and street occasions that you
will find you can hardly do without It.
The high-priced shops are carrying the
black boleros and making the other colors
as ordered. Mis9 Daisy Leitef has coats,
! all fitted and of a bright color.
The seashore hat is a thing not to be
omitted in seashore considerations. It
must be trimmed, not with perishable
material, but with silk. Velvet and flow
ers that will not wilt. Fruits and vegeta
' blcs are worn upon the seashore hat.
And bunches. of grapes are very pretty,
upon hats of purple and green.
A hat that was made in London for a
New York woman shows a top entirely
of geranium leaves, in many shades of
green, varying from very light to very
dark, and taking in deep brown, russet
and pinkish green leaves. The geranium
leaf is a very pretty one and adapts itself
nicely to covering the top of the hat.
Around the brim there is a border of
geranium flowers, bright, lovely red, all
made of velvet 'and calculated to with
stand any weather. This, is a flower hat,
but not of the flamboyant kind. It is
adapted for wearing with a summer, shirt
waist and will go well with any shade of
cotton goods.
Little Summer. Coats.
The short jacket will soon be on the
scene. Fcr a little time it is the long
cioak; then will come . the -abbreviated
article. It will resemble in general style
the bolero of last year, but will differ in
some, small peculiarities.
One of the distinctive features of the
new bolero Is Its color, iou can recall
that last year It was ' black and tucked
ahd worn open In front and very short,
like a cut-off Eton, vf
This "year it is- to be in white and in
blue, in urown "and green, any color ex

not one, but several, to wear with the dif

the foot, and worn with a very up to the

goes with it, to be slipped on or off.

THE SPRING OUTING GIRLIn his own native garments the little Jap
Jappie is picturesque and pleasing, . but
who that have seen him in American
clothes i two or three sizes too large or
too small, and,, his pretty almond-eyed
women, in crinkled shirt waist, badly
hanging skirt and unbecoming hat of in
harmonious colors, can help deploring the
change? When the recc-ip'ts of the garden
began to, feel the effect of the objection
to Americanized Japanese the Park Com

process. 1

house and served tea and wafers in the
tiny structure' over the 'fish pond ever
since the, Midwinter Fair, when they were
brought direct from Japan for just that
purpose. In striped, kimonos, with the
It Is computed that the men directly
concerned in the Northern SecuritieV^
Company, which, with its $400,000,000 capi
tal, is the second largest corporation ever
formed, represent more than 110,000 mile*
of railway and more than $5,000,000,0001
kobi strapped on oemurely behind, they
ornament the grounds as much a^ the
plants, the flowers, the stunted trees, the
goldfish, the miniature bridge, or any
of the other accessories peculiarly Orien
tal that were brought to embellish thi3
bit of the Flowery Kingdom on American
soil. Indeed, of all the rest they aloue
seem real.
The other six are men who have found
their native garb incompatible .with the
American prosperity they are enjoying;
but three weeks ago the Park Commis
sioners made a formal order that they
must return to their Japanese dress whila
serving, on Sundays, at least, or seetffc
employment elsewhere. The commands '
did not please the little Jap Jappie in the
least. Besides, being expensive, he point
ed 01A that the kimono of his ancestors
is a very inconvenient garment, because
the sleeves are so long that they axÂ©
constantly in his way. But there was no
appeal from the commission's ruling, and
so the first step in the orientalizing of the
garden was finally taken.
The next will be to increase the size of
the grounds by an acre or two, making
the garden about three acres in all, and
beautify it with new buildings, larger -fl3h
ponds and new and rarer plants. When
the change is made the garden will ex
tend almost to the foot of the slops
leading up to Stow Lake on the south*
and west and to the north driveway on
the north. ' :': "y.
In a natural basin that lies behind tho
present site a chain of tiny lakes will be
found, with water flowing from Stow
Lake through the length of the garden
and thence across the south driveway
and back to the pumping station whence
it comes.
On an artificial knoll to the south of
the lakes" a Japanese temple, dedicated
to the great Buddha, a contribution of the
tea merchants of the city, will be built.
It will be completely surrounded and al
most half hidden in Japanese foliage, and
from it a Japanese stairway will lead
down to the lakes.
On another h!gh knoll, to the north of
the lakes a new and larger teahouse wi!JV â
be built. It will be thoroughly Japanese/ *
in every detail. This new structure will
have a setting of Japanese dwarf trees,
cherry groves and flowering plum ef
fects, while on each side of the steps
leading down to the lakes will be beds
of iris. Near the new teahouse an arbor
of westaria will also be constructed.
The -new addition? are intended solely
to extend the present garden, which will
remain undisturbed except for some Im
provements in, the present teahouse.
When these changes have been made and
all the attendants are attired in bright
new vari-colored kimonos the oriental
izing of the Japanese Tea Garden will bo
complete. Just at present there is no
prettier scene in the whole park than the
sight of the dainty little sixteen-year-old
Japanese maid and her wee sister seated
on the bridge over the lake and throwing
food to the storks tha]t stand sedately
on one leg In the water, enjoying a feast
of plenty, in the midst of true Oriental
calm and tranquillity.
TRANGE as it may seem, in the
>Oy Park Comriissioners' new plans to
V J thoroughly orientalize the Japa-
nese Tea Garden, the little Jap
Jappie himself has proved to be
the greatest obstacle. He does not
want to be orientalized. He insists that it
costs too much. Having renounced the
dr<?ss and customs of his own native land
fr>r bright American dollars, he protests
with true Oriental tenacity of purpose,
albeit with unvarying suavity, against
what he regards as a piece of Yankee
extravagance.
American clothing Is cheap. For seven
dollars the little Jap Jappie 'can get a full
suit of fashionable cut. in the very latest
patternsâ whereas the kimonos of his an
cestor? â even cheap ones â cost nearly fifty
dollars apiece. The difference in price rep
resents the lesson he has learned in finan
cial economy 6ince coming to Uncle Sam's
realms, and this lesson was the basis of
hit objection to being orientalized again
according to the Park Commissioners'
new ruling.
The Japanese Tea Garden was one of the
most popular features of the Midwinter
Fair. It was like a bit of fairyland trans
ported by some traditional genii direct
from the Flowery Kingdom, and from trie
very first settled itself down in the park
with that air of mysticism, of tranquillity
and permanence so characteristic of the
Orient through all the ages.
Everj thlrg, from the stunted cedar trees
over one hundred years old. still growing
in flower pots, to the huge Chinese carp
that crowd the goldfish in the tiny water
holes dignified as a chain of lakes had tne
perverted proportions so dearly beloved
of the little brown man from over Â»he
fea. Indeed in everything, from the pa
goda-like entrance to the little circular
bridge that looks like a half-submerged
cartwheel minus the spokes, with an arch
bo low that the long-lepged storks cannot
walk under it without stooping, the tea
garden was an exact reproduction of the
Mikadcland In miniature.
It all seemed as unreal as the painted
Christmas trees in a box cf childrens 1 toys,
but when the stately glory of the Midwin
ter Fair was toppled into debris and
carted away. ' the Japanese Tea Garden
remained undisturbed as a matter of
course. Just as the playthings of a patted
child are allowed to litter the floor of
the nursery without let or hindrance.
Then the garden was leased to. a local
Importer of Oriental curios and works of
art. and the little Jap Jappie began the
Americanization of himself, and the en
tprprise he represented, in thorough earn
est. Where before had been stolid little
men with complexions of bronze ana close
cropped hair and sandaled feet, wearing
richly embroidered robes with 'long flow
ing sleeves, while, with calm impurtabil
ity. they served delicious tea and crisp
wafers that pleases the palate without
satisfying the appetite of the curious cus
tomers, dapper little gentlemen appeared
dressed a la mode in neat-fitting American
clfthei, with starched shirts and collars
and cuffs and neckwear of the latest ap
proved pattern to match.
With the romance of the garden strong
upon one. the newly acquired brisk busi
ness-like attitude of these once dreamy
looking attendants came as a shock of
surprise. They Jarred upon the harmony
of the whole like a blatant discord in a
sweetly phrased symphony. it needed
only the jangling ring of the bell in the
polished metal cash register of modern

. .'"Early on the morningjof December 24 I
sent^ Lieutenant ' Lang, with eighteen men,
yond, . making : what 'we call ' In California
a sort of hogback. This ridge and .the
slopes that we descended toward it N wÂ«re
covered with tall grass.. This is called
cougan . grass by. the natives, and Is'.so.
thick: that you can't see into it as far as
two feet from you. Stretches of this dense
grass .- are - called -by the Filipinos Vcou
ganalles.' On this, slope the trail nar
rowed to about a foot in width, making
it impossible for the men. to move other â¢
than in single file. *
Â¦"The/firstman on the trail.in our little
advance guard was our faithful old Fill - "-.
pin6;scout, who knew the \ country, ' every
inch of it, well. He was on' the lookout
at eVery tree for a .bamboo â¢ spear trap.
These people have an unpleasant way of
bending ."over a tree branch and fastening
it 'Â¦ down with a sharp-pointed bamboo
spear in such a hidden .way that whea
the unwary soldier steps on it it will fly
up and pierce him through. The old fel
low was facing this danger in lieu of bur
selves, and we were following him very
cautiously, with magazines loaded' and.
fingers on the . triggers. In the jungles, of
the ._ Philippines surprises 'and Goo-goos
are sometimes thicker than reaves. Sud
denly the scout gave a quick, deep grunt
and 'fell forward on his face. A bolo had
gone through , him, and when we reached
him . his intestines were protruding. He
was carried a little to one side, and
strange to say, he lived. Â¦ He had not
fallen before the corporal yelled ; 'Goo
goos!' In less than a second the cougan
grass .'was literally alive with their
brandished bolos and the. air danced with
waves of red sashes and caps." On their
cotton . shirts were cabalistic figures,
which marked them as members of the
fanatical religious society, which has its ,
seat in Samar, known as the Dios-Dios.
"Then they came for us.^We couH see -
nothing :else in front and on either side
but : a "sea of knives, for they had no
rifles..
"In fact, we could see nothing but a sea
of fury, and the tall grass was a chaos
of slashing, shooting. and stabbing.
"Our men who turned to fire on one side
were stabbed in the back. It seems to me
there was not a word spoken on either
side. Death and the desire for life were
the only forces in that silent buttle.
There, rwras "no ..time : 't6-* aim, so weused
the "magazines. When they empty
we clubbed the^ muskets â¢ and slashed for :
the . red- -cap .. of a Goo-goo or* his bare
head. As" soon as the firing began my
eleven men;, who were a short distance !n
the rear,- started -to; our assistance. They
' had to fight' their way through the fiends
In .the thick, \ tall' grass, into which the
blood "was settling, and only three of them
; reached" us unhurt. With- just the group
of us I . do not know . how we repulsed
the 'bolomen,. cutting and hacking at us
1 and jumping like; cats to" get away, as is
their habit! Â¦ '"-.".Â¦'
"When the skirmish started I was armed
only "with" my pistol, and that wasn't
drawn. A mad bolomah , started for me
and I had nothing tojneet him with. My
knowledge , of boxing icame in play, and
just ; as he reached j me I side-stepped
him, -so to speak. He. sank- to his .knees
.on. the trail -and "I drew my revolver and
shot him in the chest, as' I thought, kill
ing him. , Â¦ . -
â¢ '-'At the same second three of them came
at* v me on the; other side, with knives
raised. "â¢ One of. them dropped on . his
knees and made' a dive af my chest. I
parried' and -poured hot_ shot into them
with the pistol and two of them" fell.
The Mother one .ran .away, pursued by a
friendly scout, a native.':
"I; was fighting mad, but I remember
that . I ' saw . the ; f ace of ; the man whom
1 thought ; I', had j killed Â« peer Â¦ up at me . as
I turned. He was. not dead and his bolo
flashed as Â¦ h,e sunk Â¦ back and crawled or
dragged himself away through* the grass.
He had stabbed me twice in the back,
but I , did not feel it in the fierce blood
thirsty s ; tension .of the fight. I did hot
know then that - 1 had been touched, but
one thrust- went in' deep. In the lower part
of my back and the other struck me un
der I the ; shoulder blade.
"I fought on unconsciously, and when
my revolver-was, empty ..I. saw one of my
own men, now so pitifully few, lying at
my; feet..:' He was conscious, .but "he had ;
been v stabbed near [ the "heart, and death
was not far distant.. I reached for his gun
and belt and took them. Then, with th^
help of the* few men left, some' friendly
natives ; and our bearers, who had simply
sunk into the grass from fright when the
fight began, .we fought like demons, and
saw. the remaining bolomen turn and run.

tall -grass whence they'; came. In the

THE HOTTEST ONE MINUTE FIGHT ON RECORD IN THE PHILIPPINES
'.'I had gone through : that same grass
hundreds of times before, and I never
went through but I thought if few or
many of us were ever "caught In that spot
â¢we were gone. But that fight of a minute
scattered that thought forever. None of
us that lived through that fight will ever
forget It." '
"Samar has a fine climate on the coast,
but it is the worst section of the Philip
pines for military operations. The towns
are all on the coast, with the exception
of a few that are up the rivers. The peo-'
pie of Samar and Gandar are Yisayans,
and of a lower order than those of Luzon.
They are much more ignorant and super
stitious, and consequently much more
dangerous as a foe. The Dios-Dios society
is, led usually by some renegade priest or
hermit In whom ~ the natives have confi
dence. These leaders work up the natives
to the belief that they can impart to them
through selling them certain books or
prayers the quality of being invisible and
Impervious to the attack of their foes In
battle/ Imbued with this superstition, the
Visayans fight an J die like Turks or other
Oriental fanatics. It was a gang of that
sort that we struck on the morning of
December 24, 1901. It made me think of
life on the plains and the' sudden at
tack of hidden savages.
"But, all the same, our Krag magazine
guns, six shots to a man, did pretty good
work in as fierce a fight as ever took
place on the island of Samar. The men
in Lieutenant Wallace's camp had a hard
fight last October, when eighty-nine na
tives were killed, with eleven Americans
killed and nine wounded. But the odds in
our "fight were fearfully against us.
"The following were wounded and re
covered, or nearly so: Corporal Russell,
Private Bradley, Private McPherson and
Private Bonnycastle, who was a ftill
blood Indian and who was only saved
from instant, dealh through the stab of a
bolo by' the . of his cartridge
belt. Private ;Oark had just joined the
company, after twenty-one years*, service
in other regiments. He was killed in his
first fight with us. My wound, or one of
them that disabled me, turned out to be
pretty . seriousâ a sttaight-in jab of about
one and a half inches. , Dr. Calhoun at
first thought it did, not amount to much,
and I thought so, too.
"Some of those who were wounded died
later. Private died while waiting for
the arrival of Lieutenant Lang. â¢ Private
Clark died on the way to the boats, and
Private Bedford passed away in the hos
pital at Tanagnan, two hours after reach
ing there.- The death. of Private Claxton
occurred on Christmas day.
"Then we had time to find out about
our destruction among the .140 of the
enemy: We fifteen had killed thirty
seven "of them certainly, besides numbers
of them found afterward out in the' hills,
where they had fallen from loss of blood.
Our friendly natives found fifteen bodies
on the. slope of the ridge while making
stretchers. But our small force had suf
fered proportionately, and the wonder 13
that any of us survived. Four of our gal
lant American boys were killed in that
fight, which I am almost sure was over
in the space of a moment. " They were
Sergeant Swlsher, Corporal Gaughn. Pri
vate Weippert, and a fourth whose name
I cannot recall, but it belonged to a brave
soldier.
."The arrival of Lang and his men was
more than welcome, for we could not by
our own make a move to get out
cf the tall grass. They at once went to
work and Â¦ cut down saplings and made
stretchers on which to carry the wound
ed men. down to the boats. â¢ I was among
the number,' for my wounds had made me
ill ami famt. It was an awful trail, and
we all had to be tied to the stretchers.
The dead were carried on j the natives'
backs,/ and it made the most grewsome
sight I ever saw. Blood flowed all over,
the trail. We got back in our boats to
Tanagnan, where Dr. Calhoun, the post
surgeon, dressed all wounds.
bound up the badly wounded men as well
as we could with our first aid packages.
"Lieutenant Lang answered iny signals, -
so I knew he would soon be with us. As
he did not find us immediately I sent
friendly natives armed with bolos 'taken
f 10m our dead enemies to bring him to
me. It was an hour and a half, . ancl It
.seemed a very long time, before he reached
us. !-' In the meantime I was speculating
on the cause of the ambusn. The trail
on which we were attacked vra<J the only
one leading out of Dap-Dap. Having
seer, the smoke of Lang's fires, as we had
expected, they had supposed he would
come up that way and had hidden In the
grass, prepared to massacre his band.

It-is -said that Richard Harding Davis*
hero, "Captain Macklin," now published
serially in Scribner's,^ was suggested to
him by a man who handed him a business
card on which was inscribed, "Prompter
of Revolutions." Mr. Davis considers him
one of. the most interesting characters he
ever met. The Captain Macklin . of the
story Is a young West Pointer, and in the
May number he reaches the army of rev
olutionists who are the beginning of his
marvelous' adventures.
The New Centaur for April comes in a
handsome lithographed cover, and* Is a
much larger issue than last month. This
is accounted for by a long article on the
Chicago automobile show, which was held
the first week in March. The magazine
opens with live full- page illustrations In
color of well-known . autoists, prominent
among whom may be mentioned J. Ogden
Armour of Chicago, in his automobile,
and Albert C. Bostwick. These pictures
have, special interest as showing different
types of machines in use by prominent
autoists. v . " ;
! There is . grim humor about the treat
ment to which- the Russian police nave
just subjected the. popular'â the too popu
larânovelist, Maxime Gorky. Gorky was
traveling to Moscow, where the admiring
students of the university had arranged
a reception at the railway station, when
the police quietly uncoupled the carriage
at an intermediate station and sent it off.
with the novelist inside, "in the direction
of the Caucasus," while the Moscow train
was filled with police, who on its arrival
at its destination promptly dispersed the
assembled students. That Is the way they
do" things in Russia, and there is some
thing to be said for it. . ,'
Mr. Carnegie's new book, "The Empire
of 'Business,'* contains the results of his
long . business . career, which is certainly
more successful' and extraordinary than*
that of any other man In America. The
author ' has covered fully the important
points in business conduct and manage
ment, beginning with a young man's flrat
start, discussing the A, B, C of money,
capital and . labor, thrift, the ' winning of
a fortune and its spending, trusts, the.
Anglo-American trade relations, business
as a profession, the costs of living, rail
roads, steel-making, special education, the
tariff and many other subjects in a most

"A Textbook of Insanity" is the title of
a work by Charles Mercier, lecturer on
insanity at the Westminster Hospital
Medical School and at the London Medi
cal School % for Women, which the Malznil
lan Company Is publishing. this week. It'
is an attempt to. put into a nandy form,'
for. students - the main' lines of the study
of insanity, free from descriptions "of il
lustrative cases which ; bulk so large in
most textbooks. . Part I co-htains "The In
stitutes of Insanity," Part II "The Forms
and of Insanity," Part III "The
Legal Relations of Insanity." The author
has written his book on the principle that
it is disorder of conduct that gives to in
sanity its whole 'significance. Disorder of
mind without disorder of conduct, ' if Jt
.were possible, would be unimportant; If itÂ«
were important', it would be unrecosnlz- â¢
able; and thus' the, first essential to a
knowledge 'of "insanity is an enumeration
of the- main features of conduct, and of
the ways in which conduct may be dlsor-'
dered. Â¦ , " . . .

Conduced, by
Ti HIS year Joslah Flynt gives us a
' novel which is none the less In
teresting and instructive in its way
than his work of: last yearâ "The
World of Graft." . -:The World of
Graft" was the result of his investigations
of police methods In large cities and of
the life of the -criminal element. Mr.
Flynt has been "tramping" and making
a special study of sociology ever since
his youihâ you have only to read his
books to appreciate what a close student
he has been. The better to further his
purposes he has lived the life himself and
is frank In saying: VI have probably
seen all that I can of Hoboland withoat
everlastingly identifying myself with It.
and that I have no desire to do. I have
not been on a regular trip since 189S. At
the same time there comes sometimes in
the summer the feeling that I would like
again to dangle my legs out of the door
of a *side-door Pullman' and see the land
scape pass by."
His book this year,* "The Little Broth
er," is distinctly devoted tot tramp life,
and -with its blend of truth and romance
It will be found good reading. The story
Is not a pleasant one, yet it has the
peculiar fascination of revealing a phase
of life that is an absolute mystery to the
majority of us; the life of that abandoned
mortal, the vagrant of the road, who is
60 familiar as a type to us of the West
and yet whose ways of living and code
of ethics remain in such absolute dark
ness to any but the initiated.
"The Little Brother" is by no means
lacking in merit as a clever bit of fiction.
The ending of the story, that may appear
cruel to some, is softened by the bright
thread of a love affair which develops
from an apparently impossible solution
into an assured position of happy con
summation.
The main interest throughout centers
in the wanderings of "The Little Broth
er." a lad who has Inherited the "Wan
derlust" and who leaves his school and
home to travel over the country in search
of the Great Salt Lake, about which he
has heard eo much. It is the height of
his ambition to reach this magic body of
water where it is impossible to sink, and
where he can swim to his heart's delight
all day.
In Trampdom it is often customary for
the hobo to travel in company with some
boy that he has succeeded in decoying
from home; some lad who is a natural
â¢ lunaway and one with the brightness that
r.drr.its cf training in' begging or pilfering.
A boy so decoyed becomes that tramp's
Â¦Prushun," an3 he is supposed to rustle
under the tramp's direction for food and
mosey enough for both of them.
Betray. "The Little Brother." on his
first day out falls in with an enterprising
loafer of this class and Is Immediately an-
:is a "Prushun."
"All that Trampdom know of the man*
was that his road 'name wasÂ» 'West Yir
j.iniii Eiackie.* that fie was an agreeable
companion at hangouts, and one of the
most successful 'snarers' and trainers of
tramp boys that hobo life has produced-."
Their travels and experiences afford the
main feature of the book, but underlying
it all and coming as a strong second in
the interest is a romance cleverly hold
ing the reader to the highest pitch of an
ticipation, and keeping its mystery well
hidden until the last pages.
One of the best parts., and quite char-,
acteristic of the whole, is that portion of .
the bock where Blackie Is engaged in the
delicate task of "snaring" his "Prushun"
by telling him "ghost stories." He fills
little Benny's ears with such marvelous
tales of all that they shall see and do
that it Is no wonder, the boy cannot re
sist such an alluring prospect and is" won
to cast his lot with that of the tramp.
The following dialogue may possibly
cast some light on the question of kid
naped or runaway boys and give a clew
to the reason for their taking the first Â¦
step In the life of a hobo:
Benny was Introduced to the conventional
but always tantalizing "ghost stories" of his
first Joeker.
"But think of the lake and the Indiana,
Kid," Elackle remonstrated In reply to Benny's
remark about his sister. "Think what a fly
Ida you'll bÂ« when you get back. You'll te
the boss of the town."
â¢"Will I?" Benny asked, half incredulously
and half proudly, bis eyee brightening at the~
allurtag prospect.
"Sure. You'll know so much that the other
klis'll just have to stand around and listen
when you chew the rag."
"And do you thlnk't I'll be able to throw
Jimmy Bverson when we wrestle?" the bey
asked, as If this accomplishment -were the am
bition of his life.
"Well, I should eay! Jimmy Ryerson won't
holfl a candle to you," Blackie went on. "And
you'll know how to jump trains, too. You'll
like that, won't yon?" . â¢ .
"Betcher life. I ain't very rood at It now,
an", the boys laurn at me when- 1 etumble. Do
you think that I'll- get eo that I can put my
foot on the axle-box an' climb up the side
cf a cattle-ear, the way the men- at the tank
do?"
"Why, Kid. after â¢> while you'll get eo slick
that you can ri4e on the trucks and cook your
coffee In a. tomato can on a hot box. Think
of that!"
"Goodness! That'll make the boys open
their eyes, mm't It? Say, I tell you what I'll
do." *nd Benny fairly clapped his hands wilh
flee. "When. I get eo't I can do that, I'll
tell tH the boys to be at the station- some
day, an' I'll so up to the junction, catch the
fiyin' mail, an' go by Tonarga on the trucks,
drinkln' out o' the can. My, how the hoys' 11

subject, determined to make sure of ail the
ways in which he was going to be perfects
before making up his mind, which Blackio.
however, bad already made up for him, al
though-the boy did not and could. not know it.
'â¢Cert. And you'll learn how to shoot, too."
Blafklo replied, reassuringly. "Why. I've
been on trains out West when you could sit
in a boxcar and pick off Indians with your
rifle as easy as birds op the telegraph wire."
'â¢Say, but that ; 'u'd be' fun. The Indians
can't shoot at you. can. they?" â¢
"Oh. they try to, but the train's going so
f^st that they only hit you once In a while,
and you get so toug-h that the bullets don't
hurt anyhow. "I used to have a pal out in
the Indians' country that was just full of bul
lets, but they only made him weigh a little
more, that's all."
"'My, but wouldn't the- boys at home look at
me if I came back that way!" Benny ex
claimed. The grown-ups 'u'd be surprised,
too, wouldn't they?"
"I should smile! Why, Kid. you'll be so
changed after' you've traveled with me a year
that^Tonarga, grown-ups, and all, won't know
you." This btatement contained no "ghost
story," only Benny failed to see its entire sig

"How are we going to live while we're
ridin'? I've only got ten. cents."
This was the first practical question the boy
had put, and Blackie deemed it wise to sound
him in regard to his manner of living on his
previous short excursions. A Joeker always

'"How did you live when you took the other
mcving-about trips?" he asked.
"I wag so busy seeln' things." Benny re
piled, " 'i I mostly forgot about. eatin". Once
when I was off for nearly two days- I just
drank water an 1 ate berries. I had a whop
pin' big appetite when I got home, though.
Mother Dcane said she'd never seen a boy eat
eo much, but she ai.n't seen much anyhow.
This time I. guess I'll have to have somethin'
more'n berries an' water, I'm goin* so far.
I've heard the men at the tank tell how, whÂ£n
thc-y have big appetites an' are travelin'. they
go and ask somebody for nourishment â that's
what -they call it â an' I. guess I'll have to do
soirelhing like that. One man told me "once't

Koin' to ask for more things this time, wouldn't
you?" . .
'"Sure: that's the way to do it." Blackie de
clared, not a little pleased to learn that Benny
understood the. necessity of begging on "mov
ing-about" trips. If not its true significance.
"You and I'll get along together fine. Now,
you lie down and take a snooze, and in the
morning we'll ..start out again."
"Do you think I ought to say my prayers?
I do at home, but there ain't any bed to kneel

a while setting -out into the world, but
always with the invisible presence at his
side.
- So I found him one day, sitting
looking out over the green fields
opposite bis windows, calmly and
with no hint . in"" his face of grief
or fearsome expectation. I tried, but
could not put myself in his place. I could
only wonder what was in his mind. In his
German way. he told me. He coughed ir.
a. fitful way, and when he grew interested
in his story, then the pain at his heart
grew fiercest. There were sad pauses
which I could not fill. His n>st words
took him back to the day that made him
Bat about three inches from his heart
Is the sta.bbir.g thing that some day. some
early day. will meet the messen
jrer of death with a surse and
â¢ bound, and in the twinkling of an eye
Henry Brcsius will, have gone from the
mystery of life into the greater one nt
death. Meanwhile he is going around
among his loved ones as usual, once in
So ""things past redress are now with
him past care"; but only in the material
Vjsir.ess affairs _of the world. With him
the kindly German love of home and fam
ily is ever uppermost. To be with them
and be always their father and helper to
"he end of a long life would be his wish.
ad plainly the last chapters of his life
Each rage that he turns is numbered.
lb<r? are only a few leaves left, and he
will die in the reading, quicker than the
'urning of a leaf.
And this man who is daily under the
searching eye of death knows it- Heaven,
who "from all creatures hides the book of
'""te." has opened it to let Henry Brcsius
Death stands guard over this. man. and
when he bids his messenger come there
will be no tJme for parley. It may be
that the emissary of the dreadful presence
will come as a thief in the night, or his
cold hand may touch the heart of his vic
tim in the full glare of the noonday sun.
There will be no time for pleadings, no
Mrr.o for regrets, no time far farewells.
For him the mandate of death has gone
forth, but the mercy has been denied him
of knowing the day on which he must
face his executioner. Each day he must
Mve as though it were his last. .
DID you ever try to put yourself In
the place of a man sentenced to
death? Did you ever try to think
how he wou'd feel? Henry C. Bro
slus of San Jose can tell you.
"I haf scratched with dese hands for
eight childrenâ dere are seven of dem llf
lng nowâ I haf a little poy eight years
oldâ and I haf two daughters, one of dem
-married to Frank Russ In San Francisco.

I went away with his sad word* ring
ing in my ears. But through them there
sounded no rebellious spirit, but one of
calm resignation that but made th& caso
more sad. The physicians calmly call this
thing an aneurism of the aorta. To Henry
Broslus it Is a decree of fate, and a cruel,
relentless, pursuing pain, because of which
"the very breath which forms his worda
accelerates his death." 1 Nearly a year has
elapsed since his accident, and the tumor
of blood caused by a wound to the wall of
the big artery has grow almost to the
size of a cup, has grown layer upon layer,
and is pressing forward, eating Its way
through bone and flesh or whatever is
before it. until at last the pulsating blooit
of the artery will force its way through
the J wall of the aorta itselfâ a gush of
warm blood and the life of Henry Broslus
will have flown. Now it ts only a quick
stabbing pain, caused by the pumping
pressure of the blood forcing the tumor
against the nerve filaments surrounding it.
The end will be painless, Dut it may be
horrible. _Perhaps by constant erosion the
anerusim will have eaten through the ribs
and flesh with the blood pulsations back
of it; a slight overexertion, and the end
comes with a jet of blood pouring straight
from the man's breast. Or the current of
blood may be turned instead by the forces
of the pumping into the stomach, practic
ally drowning the sufferer in ' his I own
blood. But quick death will blot oat for
, him" the manner of his taking off. Only
those left will realize it ' >.->

The next thing of importance to be real

There are two organizations which em
phasize the great importance of child
life. The National Congress 'of Mothers,
which recently convened .at Washington.
The Outlook, speaking of the congress,
eays that it "seems to confirm the pre
vailing impression that there exists a
large number of women who believe that
'no work in the world pays so much as
mother work.' Interest In the work of
the congress is probably deeper and more
general than in that of any pther special
woman's organization, for its subject is
one which in the J very nature of things
will undoubtedly always be pre-eminent
to the minds of true womanhood."
The other association which is serving
In such an effective way the vital Inter
ests of the home and child life is the
National League for the Protection of
the Family. Its twenty-second annual
report shows a decided . increase " of in
terest in the various problems affecting
the family.
Parents are the divinely appointed
guardians of their children, and what
ever the benefits which accrue, to them
from organizations, their personal duties
can no more be given over to- another or
to an organization than can a star its
shining to another or a flower its beauty,
and fragrance to another.
One of the first things for parents to
get thoroughly into their minds and
"hearts is the great truth that "children
are a heritage of the Lord."
To an Oriental a numerous progeny was
the first of blessings, giving value and
stability to all others.
The gift of children was considered a
mark of Divine favor and blessing; the
.wiuuiolding them was evidence of Divine
disi)lea>mre.
Children were considered emphatically
God'e gifts. With many to-day children.
Instead of being' welcomed with joy, af
fection and thanksgiving, are regarded as
an incumbrance and a burden.
God' has designed that one of the se-.
crets of a happy home is in childhood: A
child Is one of heaven's choicest . gifts,
and in that home where a child is" unwel
come there can be no true, happy home.
God's ideal home Is one where the merry,
voice of childhood Is heard. Childless
homes, however, adorned with worldly
affluence are most unenviable.
In much of society, so" called In these
times, the advent of a child is looked
upon as a curse, while a pug or' poodle
dog is worshiped and 'Â¦ adored. . Kennels
are becoming more 'numerous -'than
cradles, and dog raising Is quite a lucra
tive business. |H'Â«Ml

IT was De Quincey who dreamed that
he saw a great chariot rushing down
the vast aisles of a cathedral, past
tut storied tombs of kings and war
riors, on which were the sculptured
fri-ms of the mighty dead, yet upon the
pa\trr.ent, in the -very track of the char
iot wap a little child stooping cewn and
plÂ«.yinr with a flower, heedless .of the
apvioaching death. So terrible, and immi
Â»;;nt was the tragedy that, at tjie/noment
wltn the horses' feet were about to crush
the life out of the little one, the figure of
a t-nr/ipcter that was lying on- a tomb
sorted up from his stony sleep and blew
a blÂ»< of warnjng. while afl angel hand
strotthed forth to snatch the little one
frojn its awful death!
Alas! that the great thought of this
dream has not been but recently felt and
apyiieWated^ ; It is not an over-wrought
pkturc of the value of child life. The re
cent discoveries of classical sculptures
revcrl the sad fact that the ancients flad
no appreciation of the value and beauty
of childhood. It is claimed that the ar
tists -whose work has furnished models for
all time have not left single specimen
of that beauty which modern eyes most
a.ltnirr. the beauty of childhood. -
Grecian and Roman- literature offer us
nothing on the great 'value of child life.
VV;th the Komans. It is said, infancy was
only a journey toward- manhood, the ;
sooner it was over the better. /
The expression, "Only a child!" is of
heathen origin. Before Christianity en-:
tered upon its mission of mercy and
beneficence child life was not appreciated
as it deserved. The condition of childhood
was frightful In the extreme. Family life
was destroyed through frequency of
vorce and Increase of licentiousness. Chil
dren were neglected and cruelly treated.
They were held in contempt and in utter
disregard of natural feeling of the; heart.
Their natural rights were but little rec
ognized. Dr. R. S. Storrs said that "care
for the child, when required at all, was so
onlybecause of the citizenship which was
about Ul be his."
Christianity has changed this sad state
of things considerably. Christ was the
great admirer and friend of little children.
He took them to his bosom and laid his
hands upon them in blessing. He declared
by his sovereign power they were of the
kingdom of heaven, and he identified him
self with them by the remarkable words:
"Whosoever shall receive one such little
child in my name receiveth me." It i?
said that the sympathy with childhood,
which gives Its coloring to modern liter
ature and art, is to be traced back to the
utterances which have Influenced more
than the literature and art of modern
Europe. ."Except ye become as little chil
dren ye cannot enter the kingdom pf
heaven," was a new saying to the world,
: and the great aspect under which all
weakness and dependence appeared in the
light of that teaching was evidently be
wildering to its hearers. " _
It has taken centuries for the Christian
world to grasp the full meaning of
Christ's utterances, and it is only recently
that it nas been realized as a fact of ordi
nary life. .
There is no more Important question
before the church and state to-day than
that of the care of childhood. The most
bopeftal signs of the times is the great
interest mothers are taking in solving
this question, which is coming to be rec
ognized as the question. A pastor was
absorbed in studying the question of so
cialism, when his wife came in with de
spair on her face and wanted advice
about the servants. "Oh. my dear," he
replied, "I cannot give my time to little
matters like domestic service. I am try
ing to solve the social problem of the
universe." "Well," replied the wife,
Jesus said of little children that those
who receive them in his name receive
hin.. It. should be looked upon as a sacred
hour in a home when God, places. a; little
babe in the arms of loving parents. " Such
a boon comes directly from God's hands'
and brings fragments of heaven' trailing
after it to the home it enters. It comes
with great possibility of blessing and hap
piness to the home.- '. * .-

need ; of parents guarding more carefully

The street' school is not calcuattd to
aid in building up the, interests, of tne
home. ;The Standard says: "The old cus
tom of -ringing the'.curfew.'has been re
established in the; villages and. towns of
Canada,' in accordance with an act passed
at the last session of Parliament.- This.
ne"w act, though not as strict as the old
one, requires that all children under 17
shall be off '- the street at 9 o'clock, the
hour of the >. ringing s of the curfew." -The
Exchange Ogives ' a Jtimely and earnest
warningion the: nighf-running of children.
"Young vmen" 'and -boys, after, the day's
work is done and supper, over, think they
must have their relaxation and fun. There
is no objection to this if it is sought for in
a" rational way.: In towns the boys and
ybtlng men assemble on the street corners
or in. places where; games are played or
where beer Â¦ or ' liquor is sold. ; The . ques
tion is submitted whether these are ra
tional or proper w&ys to seek : recreation
and fun. In the country they go to the
store or the tavern or , ; to the postofflce,
or to the small village where these are lo
cated, in which case the occupatlcms and
the 'relaxation, and , funVare much like
.those sought and found In the towns. The
question Is here again submitted whether
to the home. As much as they may love
the home sentiment, yet they do next to
nothing toward embodying that sentiment
in a bright, cheering home. Their ambi
tion is to make friends among strangeri
and not at home. They take it for grant
ed that .'the friendship of the friends at
home needs not to be fostered and culti
vated. Father, mother, brothers and sis
ters all seem to be beyond the pale ot
friendship. Brothers and . sistera should
be as courteous at home as they are
abroad. Only kind words, words of Pra^e
and encouragement should bespoken. The
cold world on. the -outside wllLdo enougt
scolding, fault-finding and. beating. Thers
should be real love and respect^ f or one
another in the home. It seems to be easier
to give the smile to the stranger and the
frown to the dear one in the home. Many
brothers and sisters have lived to regret
their thoughtlessness and indifference i to
one: another. Many children have had
plenty of time to repent as they reap the
bitter harvest of ingratitude to f ather
and mother. There is great and )"gent
need Ql children, endeavoring to under
stand, each other, and of taking- each
other at their best and not at their "wprs 4
valuation. It may seem foolishness u
give- the good-by kiss as we go out frorr
our homes and separate for the day. iÂ«.
may seem - unnecessary to' take time to.
tell our dear ones we love them, tut there
will come a time when our loved ones can
no longer hear us nor see - us; then, as
one expresses it, "Our , foolishness will
seem more wise than our, best wisdom.
The small courtesies, which are often
omitted because they are small, will some
day look larger to us^ than i the wealth
which we have coveted" or. the fame for
which we have struggled In the home
we should take time to be pleasant and
to get well acauainted.
For the sake of those who love us.
For the sake of God above us. .
Each and all should do their best

While it may be possible to overlook
slights and unkind things among the
children of a home, they seem almost un
pardonable when inflicted upon father or
mother, especially in their age-
Think of such an advertisement as. this.
"Wantedâ A good home for an/ aged
mother.. Will be paid: well for trouble.
: This -flashes before us a picture. A
sweet young mother bending over a smil
ing babe in the cradle, fair and beautiful
and devoted. Cares how. grow heavy, a3
the years go by. The older her boy grows
the; more grow the cares of her life and
thl* heavifr her burdens: . But .as only
' a devoted mother can do, she. holds tight
ly and tenderly her son's Â¦ hand, guides
him safely through many -dangers-, picko
out smoother places for his feet when the
way grows rugged, shields him and pro
tects him and guides him through child
hood's slippery paths, soothing his, heart
in sorrows and lovingly and nobly, stand
ing by him in the sterner trials of man
/hood. However much she suffers, she
neA-er leaves nor forsakes her boy. There
comes a change in the young man s life;
he marries a fair, young woman and,
makes a home for himself, but he makes
no provision in it for his mother. He says
mother, is old now and peculiar in her
ways and somewhat of a burden, and be
â¢ sides, in these modern times especially,
it isn't very pleasant to have old folk3
like she around when company la pres
ent. So he thinks it easier to pay some
one for caring for her er to put her in
an old, people's ' home.^ The older sho
grows the more care she will require and
the greater burden she will become. Then,
you know, it isn't the, best thing for grow
ing children to have -old folks around
them as It will make them old in their
ways. But stop an*. think, my boy! Re
member i you - once - were weak and help
less and needed a strong and tender hand
to feed you and steady your steps. Motn
er might have -turned ytm over to a
nurse's care with instructions that you
must be kept out of her sight as you
were so much trouble to her. .But what
true-hearted mother could ever do such a
Â¦thing? She, knowing that no. voice and
touch could soothe and quiet the sobs and
unres"t of her boy like hers, kept you
close tir- her bosom and -nursed; you
'. through- : sickness -. and -â¢ trouble to health
anO quietness.
But row behold your own Inhumanity,
yea, your bestiality. How can you re
fuse mother, now weak and helpless an.i
- in'Â»need of ; your love. and care, the beit
devotion possible? Can you for a moment
refuse to be. a. staff to steady the feet of
her who has been the dearest and noblest
friend of your life, when she needs your
support the most? Have you degenerated
into such an ungrateful wretch that you
would hire with gold some one to hold
the cup steady in her palsied hand?
How unnatural for children â, to be
ashamed "of their parents, to. refuse to
aid them and to wantonly- impose addi
"tlcnal burdens upon them. -There are la
mentable Instances of - such ' filial ingrati
tude. - There are daughters whose â¢ educa
tion at boarding school was made pos
sible by the strictest economy practiced
in the house by the mother, and who in
after life have heaped insult and burden
upon" the plain, , old-fashioned woman
whom they, call mother. Oh, the gra
cious indulgence of kind mothers and the
- ungratefulness of unkind daughters. How
much more noble and beautiful the spirit
of John Randolph of Roanoke. He was
very much attached to his Â¦ mother and
her death left 'a melancholy and striking
impression upon him ever afterward. He
said: : "I am all but friendlessâ only one
human being ever knew me. She only
knew me â my'mother." He always spoke
of her in terms of deepest affection and
' frequently visited her grave, where ho
would, shed tears of sorrow. .It was the
last wish of his heart to be buried by her
side. -Henry Clay expressed profound af
fection and veneration for his mother,
whom he considered a model of maternal
. character : and female excellence. .It ia
' said after . his mother's Â¦ death he never
met his constituents in Woodf ord County
without some allusion to her 'which deeply
> affected both him and his audience. Near
ly, his. last words were, "Mother, mother,
mother." Benjamin . Franklin referred to
his mother in the tenderest tone of filial
affection and manifested his respect and
Â¦ affection Â¦ for ' her among other ways in
frequent presents. Thomas Gray, author
, of V "Elegy. v. in a Country 'dhurchyard,'*
-' Â¦ tenderly, loved his mother white she lived.
, and v cherished .- her" memory with sacred
sorrow.'- It is" said he. never mentioned his
'-"mother's- name without a sigh. He placed
the following , inscription over . her re
mains: "The careful, tender mother of
â¢ many children, one. of whom alone had'
the misfortune to survive her." Â¦ One has
said: "Wherever the name and genius of
Gray are known there shall also his moth
er's virtues be told for a memorial ot
her." ESBHW'iHPMHPQnns
â¢ It is said a very tender love always ex
isted between ; Robert Browning and his
mother. In his early, manhood It was his
rule, as long as he continued under the

late that he was obliged to admit himself

1 j grams with ; forecasts 'to. a- number of Â¦ dls-
tributing points in all parts of the State.
.Then other messages, with a note of
warning, came, and soon the forecaster
had sent out telegraphic orders to the ob
servers at Eureka and Point Reyes to run
up a flag of warning, for a southeast
storm is on its way and perilously near.
The same orders were also sent to the
display men (men hired at $10 per month
to put up signals) at Point Lobos. Fort
Bragg and Cape Mendocino. and to the
chief wharfinger. . A few seconds later the
sinister red flags were fluttering above
the familiar .wind vane on the Mills build
ing. The streets were darkening and the
people were being driven along under a
windswept rain. The local forecast official
realized from former experiences that he
would have his hands full for the rest of
that day. And so it proved, with a venge
ance. It was not much comfort, now that
the storm had fairly arrived, that from
his morning's data, by comparison with
preceding reports, he might be able to
trace the path of the storm from the time
of its appearance and approximately 'de
termine and forecast its subsequent
course.' Meanwhile he had furnished a
tracing to the printing-room, and there
later, by means of the chalk plate pro
cess. it v was being rapidly stereotyped, and
before long the map was on the press,
with a'l its warnings.
g Before 12 o'clock noon signals were fly
ing along the California coast as far
south as Port Harford, giving warning to
mariners to be on the lookout for a fierce
southeaster. Many. a valuable cargo was
.probably saved through these â¢ warnings.
As- yet in the city there had - not been
much wind. . A light rain had begun at 10
a. m., with a wind" of eight miles per
hour from the southeast. But within the
r.ext few. hours there were great changes.
The rain gauge on the roof. was doing a
big business and fighting Its enemy, the
wind." Messages began to come again,
and the forecaster had big doings to re
cord on his second map for the day. for
a map is matfe each morning and even
ing. Before 5 p. m. the wind had reached
a velocity of thirty-six . miles per hour
from the southeast, and on* the top of the
Mills building the weather detectives felt
powerless. Later came the message that
the wind was blowing at the unheard of
l ate of 108 miles an hour from the south
west at Point Reyes. For nearly three
hours at that- point, the wind : exceeded a
velocity of 100 miles an hour. That near
ly laid out the forecaster, for he had no
. record like it. The wind had provided
him with a new record for the coast.
Even in, the great storm at Galveston,
Texas, two years ago, the wind only
reached a velocity of 100 miles for the
space of two minutes. Â¦ On. the night of
March \ its was . not .safe to be in the
shadow of tall buildings, and the Weather
Bureau offices were . full of anxious In
quirers and many messages were coming
inâ all having for their burden queries as
ot how high the. wind would finally go.
The map showed forecasts of small but
violent disturbances between Point Reyes
and Cape MendocinoJ -
. What followed Is a matter of history
for within an hour and a half from that
time San Francisco , -was cut off from
communication from the 'rest of the
world: The next morning was Sunday,
and for- the .first time .; in a number of
years the Weather Bureau station in San
Francisco* received "not- a single report
from - the outside. AH wires were down
and the i central -station- at ,- Washington
had . no Â» direct news ; of all this Western
storm and disturbance, as. the map issued
from there of .'March 2 shows. Then the
forecaster -began -to study the maps and
reports ; that come in to him.' Through
them Â¦ he followed the storm : across â¢ Ne-
vada, Utah and the Rockies, going about
as fast as the average express train, but
not keeping to a direct east and west
track. By Monday morning, March 3. ha
was tracking it southward into Texas,
and for nearly forty-eight hours more It
moved slowly across that Stateârecurv
ing a little south of Abilene. On Tuesday
it crossed Mississippi north ot Vicks
burg. The maps have since shown the
shadowing weather" detective that by
J\ ednesday morning, March 5, his stcrm
had hurried on to the eastern side of the
Alleghenles and was making for the
North. Carolina coast. The next day,

where they had to silently

powerful and nnsvrupulous
corporation. When mnr-
Binri of didcontent srone

The most despicable spy sys
tem was and is still in vogue
on the street cars of San
Francisco.
â¢â¢Seeing that men all
"round ns organised for the
protection and improvement
of their condition, the street
car men. too. have joined
into a union of their calling.
Manager Vining. calls this
act *dl*]oynlty* to the com
pany, and whenever his epics
detected a onion man he was
immediately discharged, no
matter how long nsd faithful
his services had been.
"For the last three months
the street car men of this
city have tried to avert a
strike and a.t the same time'
save their union. They have
failed to avert a strike. The
Baltimore syndicate, throngh
f ts duly anthorlied represen
tatives, made fair promises
to Major Sehntitr.. If these
promises had been kept no
strike would have been nec
essary. Bnt these capitalists
evidently believe that they
are powerful enough to be
above the laws of morality,
that on*- day they can prom
ise and the next day violate
snch promises. The incon
venience of the pnblic and the
suffering: of the street ear
men are evidently of no mo

Â¦ re now the owners of near

of San Francisco.
â¢We believe that the peo

some., statement. to_ the public as to the
strike situation, nothing: was forthcoming.

down to the "ferry in long lines.: makiny

"The lines of battle are drawn. On the
side of the employers stand grim oppres

are the desire for justice* for living wages
and shorter- hours and withal the sym
pathy of the public, as . expressed last

' . SAN FRANCISCO, April 19, 1902. .
Mr.- Richard Cornelius, President or Di
vision 205, Amalgamated, Association Street .
'Railway Employes â Sir: It is of general
report that a strike of the employes of the .
Market-street Railway system will .occur
in the near future, which ls liable to inter
. rupt the transmission of the malls on the
several street-car Â¦ lines In this city on
*Â»whlrt mail service has been regularly au
Â¦ thorized. . v .
As yellow and green cars came down
Powell street in~rapid succession the
strikers appealed to the crew of each in
turn, and with few exceptions the' men
left their posts. For the most part they
came with their cars into the crowd that
began to fill the street, with looks of as
tonishment on their, faces. Some hesi
tated about leaving their cars, while oth
ers promptly stepped down the moment
the brakes were set. â¢".:
A crowd gathered rapidly and filled the
street, extending up Powell as the line of
stalled ;cars grew/until "from Market to
Geary , sidewalks arid street were 'filled
.with the. curious and an army of strike
sympathizers. Men who refused at first
to\leave their posts or who hesitated too
long to please the crowd were jeered and
taunted with cries of "Scab," and few of
them "stood out long against the pressure.
â¢: By -a; Quarter past 7 o'clock the line of
yellow and green cars reached almost 'to
Geary street, and the' company | began
stopping its cars as they reached the car
house, realizing' at last that there was no
Hope of "keeping the line open.
Cornelius arid" his men then turned their
attention to thejMafket-street cars, after
hes.ftatlng for a time between those lines
.and the Geary-street cars. ' '.'
A Valencia-street car. No. 39, was the
first to be stalled on Market street. : ? It
was outward bound, and its gripman de
serted it opposite Powell "street' at a
quarter past 7 o'clock. After that- the line
extended' rapidly down Market as far as
Grant avenue, and on the other track as
far cut as McAllister street. Crowds con
gregated with surprising rapidity and the
â¢scenes on Powell street were repeated on
a. magnified scale. . > Â¦ .'Â¦ .- â¢. y
The strikers extended their' "operations
rapidly to. the San Mateo, the Sacramento
street, the Harrison-street and" finally to
the- Third and Mission â¢ street lir.es. tying
up the last two named after half-past
10 o'clock. Prior to the hour, set for tht
first blow/little waÂ« done in way of prep
aration by the union's committee. The
strike circular was pteiced In the hands of
the carmen and developments were await
ed. _ , . .. .
LINE KAPIDLY EXTENDS.
The" -strike Â¦" was inaugurated fat 6:30
o'clock. Richard Cornelius, president of
Division No. 205, Amalgamated Associa
tion of -Street Railway Employes of
America, and a^ dozen members of the
union, all; wearing badges;, left the head
jjuarteis at the Turk-street Temple at 6;ij
o'clock. Most of the delegation went di
rect to Powell and Market streets and
wait ed for . a particular car to arrive, the
gripman of â¢which could be depended upon
to' leave' _hiÂ« qar. Â¦: That gripman was A.
H.< Johnson; of 'car K6. 477 of the Jackson
street-llri^.. ; When that car reached the
end of .'the run>.at 6.30 o'clock, Johnson
was gi\;en, the -word and he at once set
his brake and . down off the car,
amid the cheers of the committee and the
crowd of , that had already
begun to collect;-. The conductor hesitated
for-, avmoment and ;then gayey.in. to the
solicitations of. : the ? strike' committee and
also left. the car.. V- y.\ '. * ;, ; ;
has been asked to look to the protection
of the property, of the street railway com
panies,; and there' is' every evidence that
the railroads intend to make a fight of it.

Socialists Lose Fight.
BRUSSELS. April 19.-A Socialist meet
ing was held at the Malsun du Peuple this
evening, but the attendance was small.
The impression that the universal suf

made by M. Van Dervelde, the Socialist
leader in Belgium, at to-night's meeting,
which indicates that the labor party coun
cil to be held to-morrow would recommenj

Special Disz>&tch to The CalL
CALL' BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, April 19.â An ad
vance in the price of roast beef sand
wiches in the Senate restaurant has
given rise to indignant and vigorous op
position to the beef trust In the Senate.
Senators who have been in the habit of
making their midday luncheon on a sand
wich with a glass of milk have been used
to paying 10 cents for the sandwich.
To-day, the bill of fare In the Senate
cafe shows the price of the same quality
of beef sandwiches has been marked up
to 15 cents. Among the" principal patrons
of the beef sandwich diet are Senators
Depew of New iYork, Hanna of Ohio,
Kean of New Jersey, McMillan of Michi
gan. Clark of Montana and other Sena
tors who are Included In the millionaire
class.
The iniquities of the beef trust being
thus brought home to the Senators, there
is a disposition to fight against the trust
to the bitter end. Senator Depew has
declared his Independence of the beef
trust by boycotting the Senate cafe for
the present and going home to ' his
luncheon. Other Senators in sympathy
with him who find it inconvenient to jump
on a streetcar and go home at midday
have "cut out" the beef sandwich from
their menu and taken to pie at 10 cents,
a cus> of custard at 15 cents and other
articles on the bill of fare not under the
influence of the beef trust. '

Brown, the 10-year-old son of Mrs. C. E.

W , WASHINGTON, April 19.â Lieutenant
Colonel E.H. Crowder, who has investi
gated the charges that the British are
violating the neutrality laws of the. United
States will arrive in Washington to-mor
row, and,- through Mr. Sanger, Acting
Secretary of War, submit his report to the
President. If a violation of the laws has
occurred the President will take tame
date action. This will Include Instructions
to the District Attorney; at New Orleans
to enforce the laws, and a representation
to the British Government calling atten
tion to the acts of jits agents and request
ing their withdrawal.
Because of the effect the. closing of the
camp at Chalmette, La., would have upon
the war in South Africa the British Gov
ernment and Boer, representatives are
awaiting with the utmost concern the re
port to Lieutenant Colonel Crowder.
Friends â¢ of the Boers say that two Im
portant results would follow the ejection
of the British agents from this country,
first, - strengthening , the > hands . of , the
Boers in the peace negotiations now In
progress and second, the stoppage of tne
shipment of animals to South Africa, the
most Important munition of war that the
British, could obtain. L .: - . - ._'.'â¢
The British, on the other hand, say that
if the United States refuses . to sell ani
mals, then they will buy them from Euro
pean countries, which they could have
patronized had they been so disposed, or
in case ; of failure to obtain .horses and
mules from this source they will go to
South -America. ,- j~ . â¢/ _. Â¦ > . :
Air the European representatives In
Washington -have made inquiries of Sec
retary Hay In relation -to the attitude of
the United States in connection with the
alleged British camp at Chalmette, and
they propose to immediately acquaint
their governments with the result or
Lieutenant Colonel Crowder' s investiga
tion. One of these diplomats said to-day
that not a single, Government of Europe
is ' friendly to Great Britain, and tnat-it
the United States declines, to seir animals
to the- British ; the nations ; of the Eu

There Is a difference between threat and
performance, and Senators who- were
talking of putting the House bill through
Ihe Senate discovered that they were
members of a hopeless minority. As a
matter of fact, the Senate is on the verge
of abandoning the administration quite
as completely as the House did yesterday.
Very high tension was manifest .among
the members. of the House to-day as a
result of the action of .theÂ»-House .last
night In overriding. the Ways and Means
Committee on the Cuban reciprocity bill.
Chairman Payne stated that the abolition
of the differential and countervailing du
ties effected an even greater reduction
and loss than he had af< first estimated.
His earlier figures showed the counter
vailing duty to be between 26 cents and
27 cents per hundred pounds. But this
referred to "raw sugar and the . counter
vailing duty on the /refined article -was
even more. This, with the differential,
makes , a total reduction on refined sugar
of 508 per hundred pounds.
Long of the Ways and Means Commit
tee also made estimates, which in his
judgment bore out: the foregoing figures
that the amendment \would- take ; off In
differential and countervailing duties a
total of 503 on refined sugar coming from
Germany and â¢ other countries giving

In Hopeless Minority.
: CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,: N.
W., WASHINGTON, April 19.â Defeat
over Cuba more overwhelming than that
which was met in. the House confronts
the administration in the Senate. The
struggle In the House was a mere skir
mish compared, with the -battle Impend
ing In , the upper branch . > of :: Congress.'
Only "Roosevelt luck" can avert the dis
aster. There is an apparent majority, of
twelve in the Senate against concession
to Cuba. When the administration Sen
ators heard to-day that the . Senate Com
mittee on Relations with Cuba will,prob
ably refuse to report any reciprocity bill
tHfey were Incredulous. This incredulity
was shared by several or me most prom
inent Senators. Among them were true
and tried friends of the administration
like Platt of Connecticut, chairman of
the Cuban committee, Hanna, Lodge and
Beveridge. It lasted until Â¦ the Senators
gathered for to-day's session. Â¦ Then a new
light dawned. Friends of the'administra
tion and of Cuba learned that while they
had been resting in fancied security. ; the
beet sugar men had .- been working, and
that the clear majority of -which they
could justly, boast two weeks ago v had
completely disappeared. "
In the flrst 'place they ascertained that
the Democratic Senators,' practically to a
man, would stand as solidly together as
the House Democrats had stood for v the
bill as it passed the House, abolition of
the differential. and all. ,
The situation of the administration at
tlils time is one of embarrassment. : It
would be difficult to adequately describe
the rage of the big men in the party when
they realized last night' what -the .House
had "done. Some ef them were in favor

The serio-comic part of the guard was

cleverly to fulfill all the requirements,
and K. Rees and C. ,W. Thomas Jr. were
distinctly valuable as messengers. ..'
Where the performance lacked J In the
technicalglibness of the actor it made up
in intelligence, and the stage would gain
by the addition of almost every member
of the- "Antigone" cast. " The chorus
should not be forgotten, either. It was
splendidly drilled, and in Its handsome
and graceful garb was a highly pictur
esque portion of the play.
The name part of the tragedy .was as-^
sumed by Miss EÂ» Cooksey, who, to a^
charming dignity of manner, adds an ten*
usually musical voice. Her conception of
the part was thoroughly harmonious, and
was carried out with grace, ease and
marked repose. The other women of the
cast,- Ismene and Eurydice, ".were acted
with sympathy and discretion by Miss E.
Crandall and Mrs. J. P. Hall respectively.
The strongest individual effort of the
production was, however, the- Creon of
Professor Murray, a strong and convinc
ing assumption. Professor Murray was
markedly successful in painting the cli
max of Creon's sorrows, but throughout
his work was of bright order. Tlresias.
the sage, was most intelligently handled
by Professor S. S. Seward, who made a
very effective figure as the old soothsayer.
His prophecy was a striking effort. Pro
fessor Fairclough, whltebearded and purple
garbed, had the Important post of Cory
phaeus, and led his ivy-crowned chorus
through its mystic- and musical evolutions
with distinguished success. R. V. Reppy
made a handsome Haemon, nor 'lacked
anything on the â¢. dramatic side as
the golden-locked and ill-fated son of
the tyrant Theban. .-.'.Â¦ â¢-â¢'.â¢ -
Characters "Well Taken.
A very living and expressive tongue it,
however, seemed to be on the lips of the
actors to-day. Whether or not the word
accents, quantities, emphases, were strict
ly according to the gospel of Sophocles. I
am not competent to say, yet was the
.Greek n6bly musical, rolling out in
sonorous cadence that might well have
echoed through the Parthenon, or mingled
with the falling waters of the Pieriaa
spring.
" A splendid adjunct -to the tragedy was
the musical setting of Mendelssohn.
Broad and amply outlined, of Doric sim
plicity In its curve and color and with' all
the Mendelssohnlan â¢ suavity, the music
added largely to the illusion. Some of the
chorus -work was admirable, notably the
"Invocation to Bacchus," that was given
with excellent appreciation. The orches
tral I accompaniments, under Scott
Brooks' direction, were also very effec
tive. . -
And now the play. The ages have not
yet robbed the ancient tragedy of Its sol
emn glory, Its strong dramatic ! in
terest, its epic charm. Much of Its thought
is alien to us now, its religion, its emo
tion. Yet the sacrifice of Antigone is felt
to be not less noble for its piteous use
lessness, the sin of Creon not less blas
phemous for that we no longer deem, the
bodies of the dead of that sanctity with
which the Greek regarded them. Partly
owing to the good acting to-day this was
peculiarly felt.- The atmosphere of the
play was admirably convincing. It was
kept In key from, the entrance of Anti

Admirable Chorus Work.
: STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 19.â
As en some golden Greek morning of tho
long ago, a large audience gathered to-day
to hear the stately measures of the Sopho
cles tragedy,; "Antigone," as given j by
members of the, faculty and students of
the Greek department. So far this is the
crowning achievement of Stanford, and it
would be Indeed â¢Â¦ difficult ; to speak too
b,ighly â¢ of the performance. Those who
have seen : the other rare American pro
ductions of Greek plays, "Oedipus Tyran
nus" at Harvard, ".Electra" at Smith
College and "The Antigone" at Vas
sar, .' Toronto .' and Swarthmore col
leges,. In no uncertain terms express the
opinion that, the Stanford performance
was measurably superior to them j all.
This Is the more remarkable as, wlthi the
exception of the services of Leo Cooper
as stage manager, the . whole conduct "of
the tragedy has been in the hands of ama
teurs, even to the very handsome and ef
fective costuming, that was in charge
of Mrs. H. R. Fairclough and Mrs. A. T.
Murray. The - leader, | chorus
and actors are aH Stanford men and wo

' Gentlemenâ In justice to you, I feel it is my dtity to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the sample
bottle of Swamp-Root you so kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past" five years with kidney and blad-
der trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me for the time being, but the old com-
plaint would in a short time. return again. I sent for a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, and I found it did me a world
of good. Since then I have taken eight small bottles bought at my drug store, and I consider myself perfectly cured.
It seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping.' I do. not have the smarting and-irritation. nor do I
have to get up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did three or. four times a night, but now sleep the sleep of
peace. My back is, all right again, and in every way I am a new man. Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-
Root., They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise of ft.. It is a boon to mankind. We recommend it to all who
- are suffering fromkidney and bladder diseases.
My. brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as. myself, thank you for the blessing yotl â¢
have brought to the human race in the compounding of. Swamp-Root JAMES COOK.

with fatal results are sure to follow." Kidney trouble irritates the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and Irritable.
Makes you pass water often during the day and obliges you to get up many times during thÂ«* night. Unhealthy kidney*
, cause rheumatism, gravel, catarrh of -the bladder, pain or dull ache in the back. Joints and muscles: makes your head achÂ«
and back ache, causes indigestion, stomach and liver trouble; you get a sallow,, yellow complexion, makes you feel as though
you, had heart trouble; you may have plenty of ambition, but no strength; get weak and waste away.
Swamp-Root Is pleasant to take and Is used In the leading hospitals, recommended by physicians, in their prlvats
: practice, and is taken by doctors themselves, because they recognize In It the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound. - _.',;*"
If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root Is what you need you can purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar
size bottles at the drug stores everywhere. Don't make any mistake, but remember the name, Swamp-Rootâ Dr. Kilmer's

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 19.â J. P. Morgan,
who is. now abroad, has practically'con
summated the plan to combine all . the
leading trans-Atlantic steamship lines.
London dispatches" announcing the com
bination were confirmed yesterday at the
Morgan banking house. The companies
to be consolidated will, It is understood,
include the American, Red Star, White
Star, .Dominion, Atlantic Transport and
Leyland lines. Probable additions to this
list are the Cunard, Wilson and Holland-
American companies, and it is "understood
that a "working agre'ement" will be
reached with other leading trans-Atlantic
companies, including the North German
Lloyd, . , Â¦ Hamburg-American; General
Trans-Atlantio and Allan and Anchor
lh;es. Â¦â¢Â¦'Â¦Â¦. .
Morgan has given the matter much of
his time since his arrival on the other
side. In this country the more important
details have been in the hands of Clement
A. Griscftm of the American line, while
Charles' Steele, Morgan's partner in this
city, has had charge of the legal prelim
inaries. .
It is yet too early .to give the exact
scope of the scheme, but as now outlined
there will be an American holding com
pany, Into which all the steamship com
panies which propose to enter the com
bine will put their stockholdingsâ "pool
their issues" in exactly the same way
that the various concerns embraced
in the United States Steel Corporation
threw in their stockholdings, receiving in
return stock of the main or parent com
pany. Just what the capitalization of the
conr.pany will be is not yet ascertained,
but the amount is likely to be well in ex
cess of $150,000,000. This phase of the
project will depend entirely upon the
number of steamship companies taken
into the combine.
Will Retain Subsidies.
One of the most interesting features of
the plan deals with the subsidy question.
The White Star and Cunard lines receive
a liberal subsidy from the British Gov
ernment. These subsidies would.be with
held or abrogated if the ships of these
lines changed their flag from British to
American. Because of this the ships of
the White Star, Cunard "and the English
subsidized companies will doubtless con
tinue nominally under British control.'
George W. Perkins of J. P. Morgan &
Co. is authority for the statement that
American interests will dominate the pro
posed amalgamation, and declares that
the result will prove not only a great tri
umph for Morgan, but will make the
United States the real rulers of the mer
chant marine of 'the world.;
Perkins also says that the plans will be
of the greatest benefit to importers and
exporters as well as - the great railroad
interests of this country. Â¦ Its . effect will
be felt by shippers from Maine to Cali
fornia, Perkins says, and will also result
in . a better understanding: between the
commercial interests of. this country and
Germany. Â¦ i â¢ â¢ Â¦
"It is true," added Perkins, "that Mor
gan will act aa syndicate manager in this
combination. Just as he brought together
and welded the various Interests in the
United States Steel Corporation. Finan
cial details have been completed to ti.e
fextent that all the cash necessary for the
deal has been subscribed. It is too soon
to speak. about the directorate, but let it
be borne in mind that the' control of the
company will be held here."
BERLIN, April 19.â At a general meet-
Ing of\the North German Lloyd Steam
ship Company it was decided to increase
the company s capital by 10,000,000 marks
($2,375,000). It was announced that the
company, in combination with "the
Krupps, had acaulred extensive coal
fields, which would immediately be de
veloped. -
Confinned at Philadelphia.
PHrLADELPHIA, April 19.â The an
nouncement that the International Com
pany had entered the steamship combina
tion of which J. P. Morgan- is the head
was officially confirmed to-day at the of-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 20^ 1902.

"The evidence is unsatisfactory as a
basis for definite conclusions upon the fol
lowing questions: Whether the defend
ants pool their citrus fruit traffic or divide
the earnings therefrom; whether, blanket
rates of $1 25 per 100 pounds upon oranges
and other citrus fruits from Southern
California to points on and east of the
Missouri River, the minimum carload
weight 26.000 pounds, and the charges im
posed for refrigerating traffic in transit,
are unjust or unreasonable under the pro
visions of the statute. These questions
are retained by the commission for fur
ther hearing and Investigation." . -
"The complainants ask the defendants
to be required to furnish their own equip
ment directly and not by lease. This is
urged as a remedy for alleged abuses
growing out of leasing cars from one ship
per engaged In competition with the com
plainants. "While it must be conceded
that such an arrangement affords oppor
tunities for unfair advantage, and, to say
the least, is naturally distasteful to other
shippers, still there is no authority In law
tor the commission to make any order to
the effect suggested.
"Such we do not believe to be the mean-
Ing of the law. We find nothing in the
statute authorizing routes or tariffs of
any kind available to shippers only at the
option and in the discretion of the car
riers and upon such varying conditions
and considerations as they may from day
to day or from hour .to hour see proper
to be governed by, regardless of the
wishes or Interests of the shipper We
conclude that the practice of the defend
ant carriers in denying to shippers the
use of their transportation facilities by
established routes is unreasonable, un
just, wrongfully prejudicial and unlaw
ful.
It is claimed by the respondents that
control of the routing by initial carriers
is necessary and effective In this case to
prevent the payment of unlawful rebates
by their connections in through lines or
routes. On the other hand It Is insisted
by the complainants with equal vigor and
apparent reason that It does give effect
to an unlawful division of the business
of earners. If, as a matter of right, ini
tial carriers or parties to joint continuous
routes, which with other carriers they
nave formed, may control routing and
deny a shipper any choice or control In
the selection as between different routes
thus formed, then the route or tariff may
be available to one shipper, but not to
another, and open one minute to a ship
per, but closed the next, this to be deter
mined by carriers' agents according as
they may desire to distribute the ship
per's business among one another from
time to time or for any reason what
ever.
"It is contended, however, by the defend
ants that joint through routes and rates
are made by agreement between connect
ing carriers, and those routes and rates
are to be regarded as open to the public
only upon such conditions as may be
specified under. the agreement, and it is
pointed out that upon the traffic under
consideration a through rate is guaran
teed only upon the condition that routing
be absolutely and unqualifiedly in control
of the initial carrier, joint through routes
and rates are ordinarily subject to the
agreement between participating carriers,
Â«. w 5 en they have been established and
until finally abrogated or changed they
are required by statute to be kept open
to public use.
"One important question presented " in
this case is whether initial carriers can
lawfully reserve to themselves the rout
ing of shipments and deny the shipper a
choice of established routes? Carriers are
required to follow the instructions and di
rections given by shippers whenever
practicable.
In making his conclusion and decision
Commissioner Clements for the commis
sion says:
As they were originally brought before
the commission the cases comprised those
of the Consolidated Forwarding Company
against the railroad companies named,
and the Southern California Fruit .Ex
change against the railroads, with the
Continental Fruit Express Company and
Armour & Co. as intervenors.

of California fruit shippers against the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads.
Those questions in the case involving the
pooling of citrus fruit traffic by the rail
roads, transportation rate, carload weight
and refrigeration charges are left to be
decided in a future opinion by the com
mission. .

The Howes met some bad weather during the
voyage and on February 12, in latitude 31
south, 174.45 west, in a heavy- southeaster,
she had her fore skysail mast carried away.
Very sorry, captain. Regulations you know
must be observed. Now get a tug and go
away back to quarantine, anchor there and
I'll board you in a little while and take your
temperature, and if everything looks all right
I may Kive you pratique."
The Howes towed* back.
Why, doctor. Just look at that lovely breeze.
Don t eet things my way like that very often
and hated to miss the chance to reach a good
anchorage without taking a tug," replied Cap
tain Clapp.
The American ship Jabez Howes arrived
yesterday, eeventy-nine day B from Sydney. She
sailed In on a spanking breeze, which, was so
tempting to Captain Clapp that he disregarded
the Federal health regulation which calls for
a haJt in the quarantine grounds and Balled
up the bay to a comfortable anchorage. He
bad only been anchored a few minutes, how
ever, when the General Sternberg came panting
alongside and a sternfaced member of the
Marine Hospital service jumped aboard.
"Why didn't you stop in the quarantine
ground?" he demanded.
Jabez Howes Went Away Back.

LONDON FEARS
MEAT FAMINE
Hotel: Proprietors Find
Themselves in a
Quandary.
World's Metropolis Filling
Up With Coronation
Vi&itorj. -
LONDON, April 19.â The annual Ameri
can invasion of Great Britain has already
set -'in. .. Almost within a night familiar
figures have sprung uy in the London
streets.: Americans seem to be on every
side, and no persons are more welcome,
for the storekeepers and hotel proprietors
have had a wearisome winter ] and are
counting on the -trade ot the coronation
visitors. .:..:.
The hotel proprietors of this city fear
they have a serious problem before them
In their efforts to satisfy the demand for
meat. ' The local butchers already have
sounded the alarm and are .putting up
prices; but the prices, however exorbitant,
they declare, cannot prevent a meat fam
ine if new sources of supply are not pro
vided. -
"It- is a very serious situation," de
clared the manager of a syndicate con
trolling half a dozen of the largest hotels
in London. "Our refrigerator-rooms are
already stocked up with all the beef we
can s'ecure."" _<
Lomlon itself is already donning its new
dreisfor the coronation. Electricians and
gasfltters are festooning buildings for il
lumination, the hotels are radiant in new
paint and the Strand and other thorough
fares have been repaired.
The Blue-coat boys broke up for the last
timÂ« at the historic old school on Newgate
street Friday last. The boys were mus
tered on the quadrangle and listened to
a farewell address delivered by the head
master and then started for their holi
days. "When they reassemble it will be
in the new buildings at Horham.
~ The "Blue-Â«oat School" or modern
building of Christ's Hospital was erected
in 1825/ The foundation of Christ s Hos
pital was one of the last acts of Klr.g
Edward VI, who died ten days later, July
6, 1553. The sale of the building was or
dered in December, 1889. The new school
provides boarding schools at Horham,
Sussex, for 700 boys and 500 girls, and for
the education of 2370 children, a third of
whom are to be fed and educated free.

SYDNEY,' N. S. W., April 19.â John See,

quet Richard John Seddon, the New Zea
land , Premier: Edmund Barton. Prime

Rathbone Appears in Couri
HAVANA, April 19.â Estes G. Rathbone
was brought before the Supreme Court
this afternoon on a writ of habeas corpus.
His counsel said the *Audiencia Court had
accepted the bond offered by a . fidelity
company for Rathbone' s appearance, but
had imposed the unusual condition thai
tn,e bond be made a public deed, drawn
before a notary, causing unnecessary delay
and expense. Senor Nuno, a' notary, â¢Â¦ tes
tified that it would require a week to get
the deed through and arrange the amount
of the. State tax upon it. The court re
mained in session until 10:30 to-night, ad
journing- at that time until - to-morrow. ,
Settlers Thronging /. the Northwest.
ST. PAUL, April 19.â Carefully prepared
estimates show that 44,000 settlers have
gone Into the State of Washington aldne
this spring. Accurate figures as to the
settlement in Northern Minnesota, North
Dakota and Montana are not yet avail
able but it is thought that the statisics
will show at least 20 per cent more immi
gration than the figures for Washington.
On th's basis the settlement of the States
from Minnesota west to the Pacific this
spring has already reached a total of
97.000 people. | This Is 8t000 more than the
estimates of the movement â¢ during the
spring of 1901. -

Funston was the principal speaker at the
banquet of the Colorado Society,' Sons ot

science." Â¦ He, Â¦ however,', expressed . great

When;- asked as to the building of war

RUMOR SENDS
THEM TO JAIL
According to Pinkerton, Hanks was one
of the most desperate robbers his agency
ha6 had to do with and he' expressed satis
faction that an end had at last been put
to his career.
members of the gang are now in jail, but
Longabaugh and Parker are still at large.
Hanks, shortly after the last- robbery,
was pursued by officers in' Nashville,
Tenn. He jumped into an ice wagon an-i
drove off at a furiousÂ»rate of speed. But
the ice wagon was too slow for him. Â¦ He
threw the horses down, blocking the road,
forced a negro out' of a buggy, drove into
the country, secured a fresh horse and
escaped. Shots were exchanged on both
sides.

IANISTE- WHO HAS SCORED
A BIG HIT IN SAN FRAN
CISCO.
Perspiring Passenger â May I read that
magazine of yours a little while?
The Other Perspiring Passengerâ I am
going to read It myself in a moment.
Perspiring Passengerâ Ye3, sir. May I
look at your paper, then?
The Other Perspiring Passengerâ Don't
you see I'm reading it myself? â Chicago

force the colored entertainer must com
ply with the requirements. Â«
"Uncle Tom," I suggested, and It turned
out that Walker's great ambition was to
play the famous darky's part.
"Our new piece for next year, *In Da
homey.' it may be called, la a little moro
ambitious. In fact it was a genuina
comic opera, written by our colored com
poser. Will Marion Cook, the lyrics by
Paul Dunbar and the book by us, but we
have turned it Into a musical comedy.
But the subject dealsâ in comedy fashion
â with a very vital question to our race,
the practical disfranchisement of the
Southern negro. Some day, perhaps,
going quietly on In our own little groove,
we may do . something of which people
may say, 'that is good,' without tacking
on that poor little tallâ 'for a negro.' "
"Do you play the South?" I asked. -..
"Not yet," the manager. Interposed.
"The 'Jim Crow* cars, and other Incon
venient features, are still In evidenca
there.".-,. ,.:n\^'^ i ~.r. . .
"We play Louisville, Kentucky.â¢ and?

LETTER FROM
Fanny Bloomfield Zeisler.
The Aeolian Company: â¢
Kohler & Chase, Representatives:
Ever since the Pianola arrived I have
wanted to express to you the great pleas
ure it has given. me and my family, but I
really did not have a leisure moment.
Many pianos that in the past ' were
merely mute pieces of furniture have now
been endowed with a voice.
I consider the Pianola a remarkable
achievement, one calculated to exert a
powerful educational Influence. By means
of this wonderful Invention those who
love good music, but have not had the
advantage of musical training, can repro
duce the most difficult compositions with
much the same sensation as though they
were themselves manipulating . the key
board.
The Pianola may and ought to do away
with that army of incompetent -and un
glfted players, who might be better occu
pied otherwise.
The technical perfection of the Pianola
performances are. of course, the envy of
even the most brilliant virtuoso. The op
portunities offered for taking pedal. : in
creasing- and decreasing the tempo, - and
producing dynamic effects, such as Â¦ ac
centing, crescendo and diminuendo, seem
almost incredible in a mechanical instru
ment. *tM~* r Â¥i%ffiK8i0WBSfluÂ«*Â£K
Altogether, I feel that the world Js un
der a great debt of gratitude to the in
ventor of the . Pianola. Most sincerely
yours. . - â¢ â¢
FANNIE . BLOOMFIELD ZEISLER.
Kohler & Chase, the sole agents, have
kindly invited all interested in the Pian
ola to call to-morrow (Monday); at their

â¢OATS -AJSTO AiDVEiRTISIISrG.
MASSACHUSETTS and her "General Court" are having a very . lively and talkative
spring time together. The General Court suggests the topics and Massachusetts does
the rest. Much has been said in every part of the State from Boston to the other
place on the question of appropriating money for the erection of an equestrian statue
to General Butler, but that issue is not to the nation at large, as.no one outside of
the State will be taxed either to pay for the statue, or with responsibility for it.
Two at least of the General Court topics, however, are of interest .to /the whole civilized
world. One of these is a proposition to require a citizen; to take out a license if he- desires to keep
a cat, and the other is a proposition to establish a censorship of advertising. It. would seem that
either of those, propositions would be enough to fill a session of the Legislature so full that no
one could put a lid on it, but the sessions of the General Court are always sufficiently capacious tp
hold all that may be dumped into them. In fact there is no instance on record of a single one of
them ever having been full when it was closed by the time limit So all Massachusetts is just now
discussing cats and advertising. y --
The advocates of the cat bill assert that at present there ! is Â¦ a great deal of cruelty practiced
on cats by the people of the grand old commonwealth. One cultured dame appeared before 1 a
committee of the Solons and with warmth exclaimed: "I've got tired of running to 68 Carver
street to get them to take care of homeless cats. Poor people ought not to be .allowed to keep
cats. Nobody ought to be allowed to keep a cat unless able to take care of it." That is the Â¦argu
ment for thelicerise bill.' The opposition can do no. more than clamor for freedom and assert the
right of every man to life, liberty and a cat.
.The discussion over advertising arises from a bill purporting to be :< an act to' prevent mis
representation in the sale- of merchandise." It sets forth that "any person, firm, corporation or as
sociatiqri, or any employe thereof, who in a newspaper, circular or other publication published ; in
this State, knowingly makes or disseminates any statement or assertion of fact concerning" the
quantity, the quality,. the value, the, method of production or manufacture, or the reason for the
price of his or their merchandise," with/much more to the same effect, which "is intended to give
the appearance of an ; offer advantageous to the purchaser,'and whichis untrue or calculated- to mis
â¢lead, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor/': and a /definite penalty, is provided. ;
To many persons such a proposition to restrict advertising will sound more like Kansas
than Massachusetts, but it must be remembered that Massachusetts 'started Kansas, and has lots
of the same stuff at home. Â¦ .
In the interests of the wotldwe would, like to see both these measures adopted. The attempt
to enforce thenr would add to the gayety of nations, and .the end wouldj.be instructive and prof-,
itable. With licensed cats and censored ads Boston, might become so proud of herself that she
would get off tHe earth and seek, a home elsewhere, and that would be a relief. So here's to {trie
General Court of Massachusetts, may it never adjourn. V
and coolly reposeful Is some of her
Beethoven playing, while lacking no throb
of the poetic impulse. Again it is almost
bizarre, filled to overflowing, with strange,
exotic essences, alien hues, that the grand
old man of Bonn never dreamed of. Her
Chopin readings are masterly, dazzling,
as far removed from the syrupy sweet
ness to which one is too often treated as
from the hard, matter-of-factness that
marks other too common handlings of the
wonderful Pole. Her Bach and Scarlatti
are limpidly pure, and she seems to have
particular sympathy for Schubert. But
whatever Mme. Zeisler plays she is gor
geously worth hearing, and pity 'tis, 'tis
true, that so few here have heard her.
But better luck next time. â¢ :

I AM like the Virginian gentleman that
"Williams and Walker tell ofâ behind
the scenes. Iâ but let the clever team
tell the story. It.- was after the final
'curtain the other > night that I went
"behind" at the California to find myself
in the midst of half a hundred more or
less gifted colored comedians, from which
soon singled themselves out the suave
length and gigantic proportions of Walker
and Williams. I had laughed myself limp
over their darky fun, and wondered If
things went as smoothly behind scenes as
they do before. They didn't, but of that
more anon. ,__.â. ' â
"Ye3." Walker, said, every brilliant
tooth in his bronze head' gleaming, "that
"was in London." It was after dinner, and
two Virginian gentlemenâ who had dined
âcame up to us and said: 'You fellows
are niggers, aint you now? But damme
if you look it!'- I don't know how he
knew we .were American negroes anyway.
London is full of Africans, Indians and
such like." Â¦Â¦Â¦-J
" 'Twas funny how they ended up, said.
"Williams, with his fat, happy laugh. "We
got talking and one of them finally
said, * 'Well, If all niggers were like
you nowâ but we. haven't got 'em over
there.' I told him I could give him the
addresses of a bunch more at home like
us," Williams concluded, "bu,t he wouldn't
wait.". .-
I am not a student of the resources of
the colored . race, though a few more
Booker "Washingtons, Paul Lawrence
Dunbars, Dvoraks who draw inspiration
from the coon melodies, Brander
Matthews, who declare that their dialect
will be the . fountain head of the new
Idiom, Williams and "Walkers, will compel
an idler attention than mine to their
riches. Still, I do not think with "Wil
liams that there are so very many more
at home like him and his partner.
Ten years ago these' two were "ballahoo
ing," 'angllce "spieling," in front of the
Midway Plalsance that still blots. Market
street here. They are now at the head
of. their own company, a quite unique or
ganization, commanding a salary that
pretty Mary Mannering would not dis
dain, and with a whole stack of ideas and
ideals ahead. To ! begin with, a success
was made by the two in vaudeville.
"First it was -Walker and Williams,"
recounted Walker. "I was the comedy
end and "Williams did the 'straight*
turn. But we tossed up one fine day
about it and he got the funny business,
and I have been playing straight man
ever since. Then,-so that there would be
no feeling. I changed" the bills to "Wil
liams and Walker."
"How did you happen to come Into this
kind of. thing, 'Sons of Ham'?" I. asked.
"Well, 'spects it growed," Walker
laughed. Â¦ "There Is even.no book to the
play. Bert and I wrote It â he writes mu
sic to my songs, you knowâ except , the
lyrics, and it is of no use to any one else,
being written -only for a colored com
pany." \ .
"That Is where I think your work has
been so "wise." I said, and by the gleam
in the Walker and "Williams eye I knew
I had touched the team's simple heart.- i
"That Is what we have tried to do., Not
to imitate the white folk, but. to put our
selves, our fun and faults and virtues, on
the stage," "Williams said, as eagerly as
a lordly and \ professional drawl would
permit. '.'Not that that suits our colored
friends always." Â¦;'.:,"! -
"They . want 'Virginius* "âthis from
Walkerâ "and : , sixteen-storied words, and
this''â and. the: most comical imitation of
John Drew, filled Tout the bobtailcd sen
tence, jfl
. "I.- want .to 'do 'Richard III.' " chuckled
Williams.. "That battle sceneâ I'd have
two. men on a' side, marching, round and
round the wings, like 'my army' does in
Warde's 5 'Julius Caesar.* ZipJ"
'"Seriously, , ; is - the 'Sons' of Ham' the
height of your ambition?"

CLEARLY San "Francisco is con
cert-weary, or why the desert
waste of seats that greeted
Mme. Zeisler at her recitals
this wees? Certainly it was not
the artist that was at fault, nor her fame,
that is even unto the land's end. Neither
cai. the price or place be blamed, the
same hall that was crammed for the Nor
dica recitals only a short while ago at
prices a third higher. A pessimist person
I know suggests that it is the lack of the
theatrical, sensational interest that has
kept the crowd away. Mme. Zelsler has
not been a boy wonder, nor does she wear
a coppery halo, nor travel magnificently
in private cars, nor play the heroine in
poetic liaisons, nor indulge in any other
of the little pleasantries of genius that
come in so usefully- for advertisement. As
the pessimist person says. Mme. Zeisler is
as little amenable to freak advertising as
is Godowsky. who also drew small houses
here. Still, Godowsky came here imme
diately after his sudden leap to fame, and
Zeisler's art is a known and adored quan
tity since her former visit, six years ago.
Perhaps it is only the summer madness
that has bitten into the blood, calling
forth the people to cool, green lanes,
odorous woods and dewy mornings, where
the lark sings high. Or the soothing
diapasons of the sea may be lulling
ears that would otherwise have listened
to the Zeisler songs. One thing only is
certain, that the people at large have
been anywhere else than at the Metropoli
tan Temple this week.
I cannot resist a little characteristic
story in this connection. On "Wednesday
afternoon Will Greenbaum of the local
management met me at the door of the
Temple with as long a face as nature
will permit him to assume over the small
house that had turned up to greet the
great pianist. I saw him after the con
cert beaming brillianUy, and, wondering
if some one had bought up the hall for
Thursday night, I stopped to hear, nor
In my then mood was surprised when all
the local impresario said was: "Isn't she
a wonder! Such a trill! Isn't that Za
rembskl a little gem!" etc., etc.
The magic of Mme. Zeisler's fingers is
responsible for much more in the miracle
working line than the bewitchment of a
very reasonably disappointed manager.
Be It remembered, by the way, that Mr.
Bouvier and Mr. Greenbaum have fur
nished us with the finest musical fruitage
of the seasonâ Nordica, Mrs. Katharine
Fisk, the Heinrichs and now Zeisler, not
to speak of the Chicago Symphony Or
chestra, for which something in the
ehape of gratitude should be forthcoming.
It is all they are likely to get.
But to return to our Zeisler. To me
she is one of the most fascinating cf
pianists. Godowsky, the sane, the splen
did, is still the supreme master of pian
ifctic enchantment. . But Zeisler sways
with half-hypnotic, wholly individual
charm. Unlike the Godowsky genius,
whose regnant personality shines from
some dim, remote background of his art,
every note imperious of t~e Zeieler mint
Is stamped heavily with the features of
the player. It is to Zeisler one listens
rather than to Bach, Beethoven or
Chopin. â¢ â¢
But what a Zelsler: Stung by some im
mortal madness, driven by the seven dev
ils of temperament, she draws her listener
Into most strange and passionate ways.
One must feel with her. follow her,
though Beethoven some time look
askance and Bach hold up a dissenting
finger. Yet, Is her art high on the intel
lectual plane. Not to many virtuosi is
given the broad and lucid grasp that dis
tinguishes this "dark sybil." as some one
has called her. Largely outlined and with
en almost mathematical perfection ot
musical phraseology in tone color, dyna
mic value and rhythmic appreciation,
lime. Zeisler's readings are a marvel of
pianistic accomplishment. Every techni
cal resource is at her command. Â¦ There
remain no terrors of speed, force or en
durance in her path. When Zelsler puts
down her brown finger she knows to the
infinite atom the weight of the Bound that
shall follow, not less 5n the thunderous
haste of the "ErI King"â so weirdly pict
uredâthan in the leisurely peaVI-spinnlng
of the Scarlatti "Pastorale." And more.
Her tone is as varl-colored as Godowsky's
own, though its use is less consummately
subtle. It is incomparably brilliant in the
bravura passages and Informed with
lovely tenderness in the cantablles. rip
pling exquisitely ' in the scales and jew
eled trills. Then there is that marvelous
staccatoâ but where the use of enumerat
ing when it is only necessary to say that
al lis perfection? <
â¢ â¢ ?
Enslaved as oiw Is 'by Mme. Zeisler's
genius, however, 1t is not always unques
tioning slavery. In npite of the acute in
telligence and strongly characterized na
ture of her Interpretations, it seems some
times as if the art of the | pianist were
too obvious/ as If the technician stood in
Yront of the lineaments of the master he
is attempting to portray. .Her palette is
sometimes overloaded with personal color,
her conceptions overcharged \ with* the
egoistic note, betrayed thereto by an
abounding temperament that slips some
times from. the firm leash of the artist's
commanding intellect. ' It is not by any
tacans commonly" so. Eminently logical
A FRENCH professor of sociology has been delivering a very interesting course of lec
tures in Columbia University/: New York. In one ci these he entered upon an analysis
of the physical decadence of. France,, as shown Jn the decline of the marriage and birth
rate, arid the decrease iri the number of- families..
. This analysis exhibits several causes, the principal ore being the chase for society, for ease
and luxury, for the things which not only lie. outside the duties and the profound satisfactions of
home, but which antagonize these and' make them seem .undesirable. , Young women become
averse to a marriage that does not at once, pledgea continuance in their indulgence in social
functions, and their pursuit of pleasures- foreign to homekeeping. Young men find themselves in
eligible parties, because the fine old element of romance being canceled out of the matrimonial
problem,- they must offer in its place purely .material considerations which they cannot attain.
The result is a population either at a: standstill or retrograding, and material things decking the
altar of life as a sham and tawdry substitute>fpr its fine romance and substantial happiness. ;The
experience of. France is admonitory. , " '. ' 'V ' :
But there are disquieting indications' 'that the example is without sufficient admonitory
force to warn the nations away irom the example of French practices.
', \ In an address to school children recently delivered in this city by an officer of the munici
pality the subject was "Application," most properly chosen but most improperly 'applied. The
sermon nullified the lesson of the text. The speaker said: .
,'Â¦Â¦ "These young men may be. the Pierpont Morgans of the future and these young ladies
may be the wives of millionaires." " ".,;....-â¢.
If these are the ends sought by application/then better for the republic that the young
men abandon application in the beginning, and that young women abjure it early.
Such advice and such a goal held up before the fancy of the young by any one to whom
they look with respect are harmful to a degree which we are sure has not impressed the adviser. It
puts not independence but millions as the one thing worth seeking by young men; and it abol
ishes romance,' the plain but lasting pleasures of home, the acquiring of the arts which make
home the brightest spot on earth, and it puts away the satisfactions of the heart, and makes girls
live onlyjio marry millionaires, or those whose wealth is put as a substitute . for all that makes a
man. Such teaching is so extremely erroneous that it cannot be too strongly deprecated. It puts
the sham and show of life, its iridescent shadows, its hollow forms, its exterior gauds and pig
ments, its passing show and pomp, its necessarily impermanent pretenses, as the end and aim
of existence! ,. ' :
It is at war with philosophy and happiness, and puts the torch of a false ambition to the
roof of the race and burns in its consuming fires every element of human contentment. - --Â¦â¢ ,
Tennyson made no mistake when he wrote:
Â¦ Kind hearts are more than coronets,
And simple faith than Norman blood.
A gentle maiden in her flower
' . Is worth a' hundred coats of arms.
The young men. who listened- to this sadly mistaken counsel should apply themselves to
win honest independence by their own ' exertions, and let the millions take care of themselves.
They should feel -that independence means the acquisition of a home ruled by the queen of their
hearts, whose presence isan incentive to cleanness of life, honesty and honor, and to the highest
office of man- â the offering of a good example to his children and their proper nurture and
admonition.
These are the wholesome objects, of proper ambition, and when they fill the measure of
youthful aspiration the nation partakes of their sanity and is the aggregate', of the sentiments
which inspire them. .
Every young woman . should look into -her -heart and read 'there the desire to be the wife of
her lover, trussing. that he deserves that jewel^whicji ojitshines] the .'-Kohinoor, and will be the
world's stainless star' when' tliat 'glittering stone, marred by tlie"bl6od of men and smirched by .'the
palm of avarice; has dissolved into, the invisible gas. wlierice'it; came, or is forgotten as wholly as
the name .of the. nabob, who first gloried inits possession. )
If right romance, the sweet hunger of the heart, be not satisfied in the walls of a palace,
their mural splendors, the pride, of their tenancy, the pomp and parade' they echo, are as sounding
brass and tinkling cymbal. Shelter them in a ' cottage and make it a honie whose duties they
touch with their ineffable grace, and that cottage becomes a palace. Its 1 walls are illuminated with
the glories that mere wealth can neither give nor take away. The vine upon its lintel is crowned
with the verdure of the tree of life, and every pleasure is heightened and every pain endured
with patience, because those who- dwell therein see each other to the end with the raised vision of
their .first .youth, and their, hearts abide in its romance. . .
No greater error can curse mankind than, the assumption that happiness proceeds, from
wealth alone. The two are as distinct as the color of a flower and its aroina. They may exist
together,- and they do, but neither is the cause of the other.

SACRAMENTO. April 19.-Chief of Po
lice Sullivan of the local police force has
obtained requisition papers for the return
of Wade, alias Johnson, alias Cook, who
is held by the Salt- Lake authorities as
the . suspected murderer of Hugh Duffy,
who. was shot In this city on February 17.
Detective Fisher will leave on the first
train to get his man.
Dalbert . says that Wade repeatedly
threatened him. with death if he 'ever
"peached/' and that he was in mortal ter
ror until the man was safely behind the
bars.'
"I know absolutely nothing about the
murder except what I have read In the
newspapers," he declared to-night. "I
never told Dalbert anything about It. I
was with him for a while, and when we
were in Ogden he overheard me talking to
a couple of friends and speaking about
the murder, which I had read about in the
newspapers. He was sore on me because
he owed me some money and wouldn't
pay it. It is true that I have been in
California many times and that I did time
there for larceny, but I wasn't there
when the murder was committed. I was
in Manitoba then. I can prove an alibi
all right." Â¦ .
Sheriff Naylor "scooped" the police and
took the prisoner from under their noses
in order, to lay claim to the $500 reward.
Wade was serving a term for larceny in
the City Jail. . In some way the officers in
charge became confused as to his Identity,
and supposed, that he had been released.
Sheriff Naylor, however, receiving word
from California that the man was wanted,
learned that he was still a city prisoner.
Without letting the police know this in
formation, he secured a pardon to-day
from Mayor Thompson, went to the City
Jail and demanded the prisoner's release.
The police honored the pardon, and as
soon as Wade was outside the City Jail
Sheriff Naylor arrested him on the charge
of murder and took him over to the
County Jail, where he now ia. The reward
is now being claimed by the Sheriff, by
the policeman who arrested Wade for
petty larceny, and by Carl Dalbert, the
man who gave the first information lead
ing to the arrest. .
Dalbert says that he traveled with
Wade on freight cars through Montana,
Idaho and Utah, and that while in Ogden
Wade became intoxicated and confiden
tial, telling tnat he was wanted for mur
der In California. Wade protests his in
nocence. - . - . .
SALT LAKE, Utah, April 19.â Frank
Wade, alias Johnson, alias Cook, la under
arrest in Salt Lake for the murder of
Hugh Duffy in Sacramento last February.
He is being held awaiting the arrival of
an officer from California with requisition
papers. - â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ The transfer of the case will not em
barrass or hinder the action of the State.
It is Immaterial' in which court the case
ia tried, but the motion to remand will at
once bring up the question of jurisdiction,
and when that is settled we can proceed
with the trial of the case on its merits.
In any event it will reach the Supreme
Court without unnecessary delay."
The State expects President Hill of the
Northern Securities Company to re
new in the Federal court his motion to
vacate the service of summons on the
Northern Securities Company and him
self as president of the company on the
same ground that the motion was made
in the Ramsey County District Court
that the Northern Securities Company is
not doing business as a corporation- in
Minnesota and has appointed no agent in
this State to receive service. The service
of Hill as president of the Northern Se
cutrities Company will be objected to on
the ground that. he is not a resident of
this State In that capacity, but only as
an individual. â¢ Should the service be va
cated the State will . probably try to
secure service by publication. : .
ST. PAUL, April 19.â The Attorney Gen
eral of Minnesota, W. B. Douglas, will

NEW YORK, April 19.â Archibald Mc-
Leod, former president of the Philadel
phia arid Reading Railroad, who has been
ill at his home in this city since Febru
ary 6, died late this afternoon.;
The death of McLeod was unexpected,
though his illness. was of a most serious
nature. He never fully recovered from
an operation for appendicitis performed
early last March. ; ,
Archibald "A. McLeod started in the
railroad business over thirty years ago in
the employ of the Austin Corbin Com
pany. He worked his way up until he
became president of the Philadelphia and
Reading Railroad. About ten years ago
McLeod attempted to bring about a com
bination of all the coal roads, including
the Erie, Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western and others, but for want of cap
ital he failed and was forced to abandon
the scheme. He was for a time interest
ed in the Whitney-Ryan combination,
then a controlling influence in railroad
affairs.
McLeod was also interested in the
American Air Power Brake Company and
the- American Railway Company, operating:
trolley lines in various parts of the coun
try, and at one time was president of the
Boston and Maine Railroad. He retired
from active business several years ago,
still holding, however, a large amount of
stock in the American Railway Company.

NEW YORK, April 19.â Mme. Lillian
Nordica's experience in a railway colli
sion while on her tour of the Southern
cities has, she alleges, been the cause of
financial loss to her, in an attempt to re
coup which she has brought an action in
the Supreme Court, through her counsel,
A. H. Hummel, against the Southern
Railway Company to recover $50,000 dam
ages. Bhe sailed for Europe last week for
rest and recreation, - but will return to
prosecute her action.
â¢ It is the custom of the prima. donna in
touring the country to travel Jn her pri
vate car, "The Brunhilde." She and other
members of the opera company were go
ing from Atlanta, Ga., to Nashville,
Tenn.,Â«in January last, when a collision
occurred with another train near Rome,
Ga. Luckily none of the party was killed,
but the car Brunhilde was damaged con
siderably, and Mme. Nordica declares
she was thrown violently out of her bed
and against a partition. She was picked
up in an almost unconscious condition,
and she avers in her complaint that she
received serious Injuries, which she be
lieves will be of a permanent character.
Because of her injuries, she alleges, she
was compelled to cancel many of her en
gagements and forfeit contracts to sing
in various cities.
She charges that the accident was the
result of carelessness, negligence and
recklessness on the part of officers and
agents of the railroad company, and that
she is entitled to recover $50,000 damages.
Mme. Nordica avers she has sustained an
actual loss of about $18,C00, including the
damage done to her private car, and that
she is entitled to compensation for the
pain and suffering she endured as a re
sult of the collision.

"YOU MEAT EAJERS."
Tho Baltimore Man Says Things. . '
You meat eaters who are ailing in any
sort of way might take a valuable hint
from the following:
A gentleman In Baltimore writes: "For
a long time I steadily ran down because
of an Intense pain in my side, and also in
the pit of my stomach. I was miser-
able and everything I ate caused distress.
I fell away from 185 pounds to 150. Lost
my ambition for work, was drowsy all of
the time, felt tired Jn the morning as I
did upon going: to bed at night. â¢
"I was a steady meat eater three* times
a day for several years. Somebody told
me that If I would change my diet and
take Grape-Nuts BreaVfast Food at two
meals In the day I would Improve. I
made the experiment and In less than
two weeks began to Improve very rapidly.
My appetite came back, and I slept better
than I had for months.
"1 used Grape-Xuts both at breakfast
end iunch and ate a little meat for dinner,
but not much. I discovered that a few
teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts would fur-
nish more nourishment than quantities of
xnfat-
"Jiy lmpro\ r einent has continued until
now I weigh 195 pounds, which is again
of about 43 pounds in live months, and I
feel In â¢magnificent condition. Please do
not publish â¢Â¦ my name if. you .use this
tetter, but I will 'gladly tell any person of
the benefits received if self addressed,

especially since it has developed that the
assassin was held nine days without be

With this object in view, we recommend to
all organized workers. In national. State, cen
tral or local unions, that at their public cele
brations on" May 1, July 4 and September 1
(Labor day), 1902, they concentrate their at
tention to a decision of the abolition of Injunc
tions in labor disputes and the passage of reso
lutions demanding at the hands of Congress
and the Legislatures of their respective States
the enactment of laws conforming to that
purpose. It is urged, too, that at the conven
tions of the national unions, the State Federa
tions, as well as at stated meetings of the
central labor unions and local trade and fed
eral labor unions, this subject matter be fully
discussed, emphatic action taken thereon and
,the result of that action promptly communi
cated to the United States Senators and mem
bers of Congress from your respective States
and to the members of the Legislatures of your
respective districts. > Â¦ , â¢ _,
U'he American workmen are law-abiding,
faithful and loyal citizens ; they . have no de
sire for immunity from the law governing other
citizens, but they most emphatically resent,
and protest against the action of courts con
victing them and sentencing them to prison tor
acts which they have the legal right to per
form; and condemned, too, without proper op
portunity and defense and trial by a Jury of
their peers.
This impending and growing danger, there
fore, impels; us to appeal, to the workers and
to all people of our country, so that the true
feeling of all may be expressed and registered,
so that the public opinion of the people of our
own common country may more definitely im
press Itself upon the . minds of our national
Congress and StatÂ£ Legislatures. . Â¦
. Â¦ Thus far j we have been unable to persuade
the Congress of the United States to enact
laws that shall protect the rights and liberty
of people - engaged in industrial - disputes, and
many of the courts have interpreted this fail
ure on the part of Congress aa a warrant and
authority to extend the use, or more properly
speaking, the abuse of i the writ of injunction
bo that the scope of -each writ still further
Invades cur constitutionally -guaranteed rights.
There are few contests In which the tollers
are Â¦ engaged Â¦ for Improvement or for the pre
vention ' oÂ£ . deterioration " In their - condition,
unless injunctions are issued by the pourts of

legal and moral rights of the workers to per
form perfectly legal and legitimate acts to
carry on effort to a successful termina
tion. ' Injunctions of a flagrant, unjustifiable
and outrageous character are continuously Is
sued, and honest,naw-abidins and faithful citi
zen workmen are thrust Into prison for periods

Cannon stated that ' if the Senate dealt
with the bill as Weeks -suggested 'the
House would In due time and in Its own
way deal with the amended bill. Can
non's remarks put the House in good
humor and brought the discussion back

charge of the bill, explained that it car
ried an appropriation of . $6,362,455, being
$801,556 less than the current law.
Grosvenor of Ohio took occasion to talk
on the action of the House yesterday on
the Cuban reciprocity bill. He said that
the differential on refined sugar had been
placed in the Dingley bill against the pro
test of the sugar trust and at the request
of the beet sugar producers. He said the
beet sugar men had overreached them
selves. In order to accomplish the humil
iation of . certain members of the House
they had not only struck off the differen
tial on sugar, but also the countervailing
duty on bounty-produced sugar. Refer
ring to what might occur in the Senate,
he said the action of the House by the
vote of the Democrats and the controlling
factor In the House (the beet sugar Re
publicans) had made.it impossible for the
Senate to remove the differential amend
ment. Any Senator who voted to strike
out the Morris amendment would be ac
cused of favoring the sugar trust

purpose of the last bill was to -authorize

lations by which there would be no prop
agation of undesirable birds, such as Eng
lish sparrows, but that the propagation
would be confined to desirable game birds.
A bill providing for two additional As
sociate Justices in Oklahoma treated
a rather lively discussion on r the proviso

HIGHEST GRADE
PIANOS.
Choice S650 Styles Now $438.
Ordinary $250 Kinds, Also
Brand New and Warranted,
SI37 â Elegant S350 Pianos
$218, etc.â Easy Payments.
Look Into This.
The great introductory piano sale of.
Pommer-Ellers Music Company Is now in
lull swing.
It is safe to say that more pianos have
been sold In San Frajiclsco and vicinity
during the past ten days than have been
sold in any three -weeks heretofore.
Everybody is now buying a fine piano-
millionaire, merchant and mechanicâ and
there are several customers who have
purchased two pianos of us during this
sale. . .
The most costly upright and &rana
pianos ever seen In the "West are now dis-
played at Pommer-Eilers' retail sales-
rooms, aÂ»d many are being snapped up
each day by eager buyers, who know a
bargain when they see it.
Pianos that were heretofore Â«old for
J650 and $700 by other dealers who previ-
ously held the agency can now be ob-
tained at Pommer-Eilers Music Company
for $457. $1S6 and $438. There are no finer
or better pianos in San Francisco than
these. Nor is it necessary to pay all cash
down. No additional charge, except sim-
ple interest, is made when easy monthly
payments are desired.
T1S WELL TO REMEMBER.
Remember, too, that during this sale
we will sell you a better and in every way
mere serviceable piano for 5127 than can
be secured elsewhere for even $200-brand
new and fully warranted pianos. And
for $186, on payment of *6 down and 56 a
month, we will sell you a more superior
and in ever>' way more desirable piano
than any old-time dealers in their slow
n-ay can afford to let you have for $325.
This is not mere idle talk, but a fact
that Is being proven to dozens of callers
at our retail salesrooms each day.
DISGRUNTLED DEALERS.
Of course it is only natural for dealers
v. ho cannot openly compete with Pom-
mer-Eilers Music Company to cast slurs
at our instruments and to endeavor to
belittle their value. We cannot expect
them to speak a good word for our goods
when they have pianos of their own to
E ell. for which on account of circum-
stances they must ask bigger retail
prices although their pianos are not in-
trinsically worth any more than ours.
One little concern, not having sufficient
knowledge of modern merchandising facil-
ities nor sufficient capital to buy Instru-
ments at wholesale at anywhere near
right prices, even goes so far in its re-
cent advertisement as to refer to "moss-
back ( webfoot) dealers, who would prop-
erlv 'soak' a customer. ' Digmnea lan-
cuaee iÂ«=n't it? It is undoubtedly meant
5? a reference to us and to convey the
impression that we would overcharge our
customers. '. ' ' ! - '
A WORD TO THE "WISE."
Of course our success here is apt to
turn the heads of little, idle dealers green
with envy- But he should remember that
his so-called best piano, for which he is
asking the public to pay him something
like $.t50. Is sold by our "webfoot" con-
cern for $386. It costs not to exceed $o
freight to bring one of these pianos from
the north to San Francisco.
A word to the "wise," therefore, Is suf-
ficient.
A FEW MORE PRICES.
The piano that we offer now for $327 has
never heretofore been sold for. less than
$500 and even to-day, when every other
piano selling concern Is apparently mak-
ing numerous concessions in order to
compete with Pommer-Eilers Music Com-
panv. you will find that such 1 quality and
Btvle cannot be obtained elsewhere for
less than $500. This indicates that Pom-
mer-Eilers Music Company can save you
enough money in the purchase of a piano
to fairly educate the entire family In
Do not fail to sÂ«e these very latest style,

The members of the general committee
are confronted with figures from all sec
tions which make them begin to realize
that they were too conservative when
they made the statement that at least
50,000 people would accompany the repre
sentatives to the convention city. They
believe at this time that the number will
be nearer 75,000. The supreme representa
tive of the State of New Jersey states
that he will come out with 150 Knights and
a large number of their relatives and
friends. The Grand Lodge of Maine has
officially taken charge of the matter of
sending Knights to this city, and is now
making arrangements to that end. The
assurance is that there will be a larg$>
representation from that section of the
country, vr' .'Â¦Â¦'Â¦-..Â¦ ' Â¦Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦â¢Â¦ = Â¦â¢' . . > -
The Imperial Council of the D. O. K. K.,
which is to the order of Knights what the
Shriners are to the Masonic fraternity,
will meet here at the same .time as the
other bodies. The local branch of the de
gree will open headquarters at the Palace
Hotel and entertain the imperial repre
sentatives in imperial style, and will have
an imperial night for the purpose of tak
ing a number of pilgrims into the pres
ence of the great moguls.
The temples of the Rathbone Sisters,
the ladies' auxiliary of the Knights, of
this city and across the bay will tender
a reception to the members of the Su
preme Temple of that branch of the or
der, and they will do something along the
line of entertaining the ladies of visiting
Knights who are not members of the Su
preme Temple.
The Supervisors still have under consid
eration the request for the use of Union
Square upon which to place the county
exhibits that will be sent here to adver
tise the State. For such exhibits Fresno
has subscribed $1500, Solano $1000 and Tu
lare $350. The latter sum has been doubled
by contributions of the Pythian lodges of
the county.
The people of Oakland want the Uni
form Rank, which it is expected will be
10,000 strong,' to cross the bay and parade
there one . day during -the stay of the
Knights in this city.
The third regiment of the Uniform
Rank of the domain of California will
come to this city from the lower part of
the State several hundred strong and
bring its 1 military band.
'It has been discovered; that in the past
when a large number of strangers have
come to this city they have been allowed
to simply roam about and . gather such
information as was possible for them to
obtain by inquiry. It has been suggested
that the local lodges select a numoer of
members who shall each be assigned a
group of fifty to take around to points of
interest and explain as they go along, so
that they may have a complete knowledge
of the city when they leave..
Yesterday the committee was consider
ing'plans for illuminating Market street
that have been submitted by several elec
tricians, but as yet none has been adopt
ed. Many novel ideas have been pre
sented.
The work of planning for the reception
and entertainment of the Knights of
Pythias, the Uniform Rank of the order,
the Rathbone Sisters and the D. O. K. K.
is still going on, and many suggestions
are being considered by the general com
mittee.

rBOK EEV. FATHER AUGUSTINE
JteCLOKY.
It gives me much pleasure to recommend to
the public Mr. George Mayerle of 1071 Market
ctreet, San Francisco, strictly as a skillful and
expert optician. My sight began to fail in 1877,
twenty-five years ago. and since that time I
have been wearing glasses. I consulted a prom-
inent optician in Chicago, Dr. Holmes. At dif-
ferent times since that I have had lenses fitted
on in St. Louis. Cleveland. Ohio,' and also tried
the Fifth-avenue opticians in Pittsburgh who
claim to be among the best In their line in the
country. I do not hesitate to say that I have
n:et with better and more satisfactory results
with MR. GEORGE MAYERLE than with any
of the above named, who have much higher
pretensions. Respectfully,

Importance that the paper attached to the

disguise himself with a false mustache so

she exhibited a feeling of animosity
against him- and endeavored in many
ways to cast -discredit upon him. .For

'*â¢:'; WOMAN! TELLS "STOSYT--
LJke all women of - her class, she is a
rredley of contradictions. About 28 years
of age, and of the world worldly, she pro
fesses tor- look upon' her late companion
merely as a "good thing,", who treated
her with kindness and whose going caused
her no heart pangs. But behind her smil
ing exterior no one may know what furi
ous flames, of jealousy and rage for her
desertion have prompted her to the dis
closures which she claims to have made
reluctantly. Â« ,'
-'According to Captain Seymour, it was
with the 'utmost reluctance j that' the
Dixon woman was induced to reveal the
damaging facts contained in- her state
ment and on which rests the principal
: basis for suspecting Hadley of the crime.
She says that she did Â¦ everything she
could .to shield Â¦ him, but in the same
breath claims that she does not and never
did care for him. ' :,
a. "I do; not' accuse Hadley of. murdering
Nora Fuller," said Captain Seymour. "It
is Â¦Â¦ not my. custom to say in' advance
whether | or not I believe a man . guilty,
but I * do think that the facts we have
developed tend strongly to connect Had
ley with this crime and justify us in using
our utmost efforts to effect his capture."
v T TALKED WITH RELUCTANCE.
Theodore Kytka, the handwriting expert
of the police department, has made a re
port to Captain Seymour stating that the
sigqatures of Hawkins in Umbsen's rent
ing book, the handwriting of the ."ad
vertisement" handed into the Chronicle
office by Bennett, the chlrography of the
Examiner advertisement and the speci
mens of. Hadiey's handwriting obtained
by the police are the product of one hand.
So fat. as the police are concerned the
alleged connection of Hadley with the
Fuller murder rests upon the above facts.
Captain i Seymour will not say that he
believes him guilty of the heinous crime,
but he believes that the incriminating
circumstances are stronger against : this
latest suspect than against any other
whose name had been mentioned in .the
case.- : -. ;. , y ' . , Â¦ -'Â¦- .-

money from the bank since his departure
and his whereabouts remain a mystery.
He is~said by the Dixon woman to
have occasionally worn a false mustache
about the .house, and when this addition
was made to photographs of him. which
leprosent him as being clean shaven, some
of the men who met and talked with
Bennett positively identified Hadiey's pic
ture as a likeness of Bennett or Hawkins.
Others found a strong resemblance and
only Â¦ Krone was positive that Bennett
and Hadley were nbt the same men.
Again the. Dixon woman states that af
ter Hadley had disappeared she found
among his effects some underclothing and
in overshirt, which were stained with
blood. These' she claims to have burned,
but gives no satisfactory explanation for
such action.
...Tucked away In a closet In the Sutter
street house were found two handker
chiefs, both bloodstained and one partially
burned, and in the clothing left by Had
ley were, two handkerchiefs of exactly
the same material as one of those rescued
from the drain pipe of the closet. The
handkerchiefs are of an ordinary kind
,that many men might carry.'
, Hadley disappeared from San Francisco
on January 16. the day on which the fact
was first made . public . that .Nora Â¦ Fuller
was missing from her; home and possibly
had been murdered. . : , -.- ;
He quitted the city without making the

HADLEY DISAPPEARS.
To .what she claims . was ; a. chanco re
mark of hers made to a detective on I a
streetcar about ten days ago is due the
fact that the police . have singled but
Hadley as the- probable slayer ..of /Nora
Fuller. When HadJey first disappeared
Detective Cody worked on the case and
met the Dlxon . woman, who represented
that she was Hadiey's wife. Heisaw.her
on a streetcar ten days ago and asked
her if she had heard -anything of the
missing: man. -She answered in the nega
tive, adding that. she became frightened
over the Fuller case and dropped the,en
tire matter. ... ... :
Cody did not . press the inquiry, but re
ported the conversation to Captain Sey
mour, who â¢ at once realized its -possible
significance and began a personal investi
gation along the lines suggested by - the
woman's conversation.- As a result the
police are prepared to say that .suspicion
points strongly to Hadley ,as : . the* man
who decoyed Nora Fuller to the Sutter
street house and left her dead' body there
on or about . January 11, 'and give as
grounds for such suspicion the following
facts: Â¦Â¦;.'â¢:Â¦.,Â¦Â¦-â¢' .. ' â¢

to find trace of him. What her motives

On January 16 last Hadley walked out
of the Examiner office at 5:30 o'clock *n
the afternoon and disappeared as: mys
teriously as though the earth had swal
lowed him up. For a few days a desul
tory effort was made to ascertain his
whereabouts and the reasons for his sud
den withdrawal from the ordirfary/chan
nels of lus life, and then the. matter was
allowed to rest. Days grew into weeks
and \ieeks to months, and still no tidings
came from Hadley. At the time It was
whispered that he was in financial ar
rears with the concern which ; had : em

intimation that there was no _ desire -to

sioners are a matter of Importance.
The action of the Board of Railroad
Commissioners: in reducing the rate for
moving oil by rail from, the Kern River
district to this city a few cents per bar
rel Is not likely to permanently affect tho
situation to any marked extent, though
there 13 a present benefit.. especially to
those who are concerned in outstanding
contracts for oil fuel. This is the opinion
ot oil men In San Francisco. When, the
Standard Oil Company has completed iuÂ»
pipe line to Point Richmond the cost of
moving fuel oil by that agency will be
approximately something like 8 cents per
barrel, or possiDly a little Ies3. The rail
rates agreed upon under the compromise
ettecteu aurins the week by the com
plainant and tne railroad companies be
tore tne Kailroad commissioners are sev
eral times tne prospective pipe line cost
of transportation.
The Standard Oil Company has begun
to establish. Its pipe line system to tide
water on San Francisco Bay for It3 own
use. The company has already a vast
amount of fuel oil in storage and is con
structing vast tankage for tne storage
of still greater quantities from Kern
County.
In a very few months the Standard
Company's pipe line will be completed
and ready lor operation. The competi
tion In tnls city now 13 strong between
the various parties who are supplying
fuel oil under contracts to manufacturers
and other employers of large power In a.
mechanical way. The Associated Oil
Company and the outside companies that
are building up a market here to the best
of their ability are equally concerned in
being able to meet the Standard Oil Com
pany on even terms If possible, and the
difference between pine line transporta
tion and the cost of moving by rail Is cer
tain to be a problem. In which thousands
of stockholders In oil companies are con
cerned.

LOS- ANGELES. April 19.â It took Sac
rainenlo's ball players ten innings to
win to-day's gameâ a. game that should
have gone to the home team but for hard
luck; To Thomas, the new pitcher for
the Sacramentos, and Briseno. a diminu- J
tive local shortstop, who took Unglaub's
place, is due the credit of winning the
game. Thomas pitched steady, intelli
gent ball,, and Briseno's phenomenal
catch of a Hue fiy cut off two runs.
Waddell made a strike out record, but
â¢was hit when hits were needed. In the
fourth fnumg the big southpaw struck
out three men in succession. - Two- bad

Oakland aga'n made the Ponies look like
four nickels in a slot machine yesterday
afternoon. They landed* on little Chim
mie der While: in the last debate of the
day and hatted la two runs, which enti
tled them to the money anH .praise.
Francks >dld the important stunt with a
drive to the center garden, scoring Mc-
Creetlie, who was at' second.
McHale did fine work in left field, and
Shugart frequently provoked loud cheers
frcni the -spectators by the clever way he
chased flics around third. Little Mohler
was as clever as ever at. second-. Buck
Frar.cks robbed Whalen of a clean hit by
his "last work at short. The Ponies did
not make a-single miscue, but lost on ac
count of not slugging hard enough. The
score: \ . . â Â¦ , Â¦

In the meanwhile, the . abbey Is rigor
ously closed to the public. This fact
seems to have whetted the appetite of
sightseers, who are resorting to all kinds

refused admission they flock to the United

of the officials. The latter' s applications
to the Board of Works in behalf of the

Roadmaster R. W. Baxter obtained
about forty laborers In Santa Clara and
Santa Cruz counties yesterday and
brought them to Alameda this morning.
After the men were dined at a local res
taurant at the expense of the railroad
company they learned of the strike con
ditions prevailing at the mole and almost
to a man declined to go to work. .
Roadmaster Baxter is not discouraged
at the situation, however. In speaking
of the existing status of the trouble and
the future prospect Mr. Baxter said: "
"We have not yet secured all the help
we need. Thirty-five men are now at
work in the places of the strikers. By-
Monday we expect to have seventy-five
men working. We harbor no hard feel
ings against the men who quit us. If
they apply for their jobs at the old rate
of pay we will take them back."
ALAMEDA, April 19.â Some work was
done along the narrow gauge mole to
day by a gang of thirty-live graders
working in place of the strikers who
walked out four days ago. The men were
guarded by a squad of special railroad
police. Most of the new laborers were
secured from San Francisco employment
offices. They were not molested by the
strikers, and the pickets of .the latter
freely discussed matters with the men at
work.

AERIAL COURSE
The demurrers overruled had reference
to the charge that the Assessor failed to
account for certain fees ' that came into
his possession, that he refused or neglect
ed to turn these .fees over to the Titas
urer as required by law and that ho has
since appropriated them to. his own per
sonal use., Â¦Â¦"Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦.Â¦'. Â¦ â¢ . Â¦-'Â¦Â¦Â¦
The' disposition of the demurrers was
followed by a demand from the court
that Dalton plead to ' the charges Â¦ against
him. He pleaded not guilty and demand
ed a Jury trial. The Jury trial was , de
nied by the Judges and an exception was
laken by Dalton's attorneys. '
The Judges decided to set' the trial'for
next Monday morning at 10 o'clock, when
they will sit again as to-day. Upon being
asked what , his answer would be -Mr.
Fitzgerald said Â¦ that it would be an ad
mission of nearly allthe acts complained
of in the complaint, but that it would
contain a denial of any intent to defraud.
Just before â¢ the . case acyainst him was
taken up this morning Dalton' paid into
the /County Treasury . $4087 in , fees that
Judge Ogden*held in a recent decision, he
is not' entitled to. . These fees were col
lected from the city of Oakland for the
assessment rolls that were â¢ furnished it
by Dalton. ' Attorney Fitzgerald stated
this afternoon that the money waa paid
in because no ' appeal will be taken from
the decision regarding :them. ' The only
pppeal will be from the decision In the
polltax case. *. .
e-H^H~H"H--I"I'I;l"^I"I"l"!"r-I"I"!^ O
Points i Raised in Demurrers.
- The - court did not decide this feature
of the case at once, but left it open until
later in the day.' Attorney Carl Abbott
then devoted himself to an exposition of
the demurrer that had been filed in behalf
of Mr. Dalton. . He attacked the com
plaint because it recited more than one
cause of action, and contained no ade
quate showing that the poll tax fees col
lectedby Dalton were not legally his.
In reply Attorney de Golia said that the
complaint might have as many causes of
action as necessary, as there is only one
penalty, anyway, and in a crimnal pro
ceeding it is different than it. is in a civil
one. It was only necessary to show that
Dalton was guilty of official neglect.
a The court adjourned temporarily to
consider Mr. Abbott's contention regard
ing the poll tax fees. After 1 deliberation
Judges Melvin and Hall decided that they
agreed with the decisions of Judges Og
den and . Ellsworth Â¦: that the fees belong
to the county.
Following a desultory argument that
occupied all of the latter half of the
afternoon the Judges again adjourned to
consider the demurrers presented by the
defense. Upon their return Judge' Melvin
announced that it. had' been decided to
sustain one and overrule all the- other de
murrers, some tenUn f* â¢ : -->:â
Â¦The demurrer sustained was ' In; regard
to ' the approving of : claims for books by.
the Assessor in favor of the -..Enquirer
Publishing: Company. " It is. charged Â¦ in
the complaint that Dalton approved the
claims, knowing that the books were not
as represented and that : they were
charged $2 more for than permitted in the
schedule. â¢ V â¢ .
Abbott Attacks Complaint.
"This is not a case where a man ts de
prived of his liberty or his fortune,'': he
said. "He simply loses his office, and if
he Is guilty of malfeasance it . ought not
to require a Jury to decide whether he is
guilty or not." Â¦ ; ;v?
Replying to Mr. Fitzgerald Attorney de
Golia, for the accusor,' submitted 1 a de
cision in, a 'case similar'' to theMone^at
hand,: in which the Supreme : Court held
that the, lower court had' not) erred in'de
nying the defendant a' jury.";' Inl that case
the defendant appealed . on .} the I ground
that the* proceeding; against- him' should
have been of a criminal' nature. Mr. de
Golia said that section 772 was. found to
be based on the constitution, which gives'
the Legislature power to designate how
recreant officials shall be removed. The
Legislature in its wisdom had seen fit in
this class of offenses to insist upon a
suiffmary removal without the interpo
sition of a Jury. V Â¦
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton must
stand trial j for the | malfeasance lin - office
charged Â¦ against I him .by former /County,
Clerk James E. "Crane. ";Â¦ That much ,waa
decided' to-day, by. four Judges /of the
Superior Court sitting ; in bankâ Judges
Melvln, Ellsworth, Hall; and Ogden., They
overruled Daltoh's demurrer I to the* com
plaint in' all but one instance,' and then
ordered him to appear, before them 'next
Monday, when | under 'the . lawi he " will
be compelled, to stand; trial:. before the
court without. a jury- Â¦ . / ;:' â¢;
"the day began with ' the presentation of
authorities .by' "Attorney Fitzgerald of
Daltoh's counsel to 'sustain; his contention
that section 772 of the .. Penal' Code, upon'
which ; Crane's accusation; rests,' is uncon
stitutional in that it denies .the defend
ant t^ie right of a" trial' by Jury. ;This,' he
claimed, was in conflict'- with, the pro r
visions of the State and the United States
constitutions. '. Â¦Â¦ :'-:',C 4 ";Â¦'..'. !

The supreme grand master workman
and several of the grand officers were in
San Jose on the 17th. on the 18th they
â¢were at Sacramento, where they were re
ceived br the local lodges in the Assem
bly chamber. Secretary of State C. F.
Curry was master of ceremonies. On the
21st he will be received by the lodges of
Los Anjreles and while there will be en
tertained at a banquet.
The supreme master workman is a logi
cal speaker, but not one of the kind who
has the power to enthuse. He is one of
those individuals who can sit down with
another and discuss a proposition in a
convincing- manner, but he lacks oratori
cal force. To the membership of the lodges
here he was somewhat of a disappoint
ment, for during neither of the speeches
he delivered at the meeting in Alta Lodge
end the one at the reception tendered
him in the Metropolitan Temple did he
advance eny new ideas in connection with
the good for the order. '
A year ago the deputy grand master
made a radical change in the selection of
the district deputies for the lodges In San
Francisco. He Increased the number and
decreased the number of lodges, so that
they could make more visits to the lodges
assigned to them, and it also was ar
ranged that no deputy should be a deputy
of the lodge in which he held his mem
bership, for the reason that if a question
came up before him for decision he. per
force, would be an interested party and
bis decision would not have the force of
that of an impartial party. It was also
arranged that the deputies would be given
lodges so as not to interfere with the
nights of the meeting of the lodge they
belonged to. This was looked upon in the
light of a step' In the line of progression,
and it was hoped that this year there
might be some Improvement in the mat
ter of further increasing the number of
deputies so that none weuld have more
than two lodges to attend to, but the new
administration wtprd out the progressive
line and went back to the old methods,
reducing the number of deputies to eight,
giving all but two four lodges each and
making each the deputy of the lodge in
which he is a member. Experience has
shown that no deputy can afford to at
tend to four lodge meetings a week dur
ing twelve months in succession, and the
result is that the lodges are not as care
fully watched, instructed and enthused as
the ought to be.
famous topical songs, and he
was received with so much demonstration
in the matter of applause and cheers that
after he retired the supreme master ad
vanced to the footlights and said: "I have
one thought to expressâ that is, that
when you have a brother as a grand offi
cer who is so much in the hearts of. the
brothers as is your grand receiver, then
there is no fear that there will be a lack
of enthusiasm in workmanship." It was
a pretty compliment to a member of the
order, than whom no one is more appre
ciated by the general membership.

PERSONAL MENTION.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. April 19.-Walter
Vrooman. founder of Ruskin College in
England and head of the great co-opera
tive enterprises which have their center
at Trenton. Mo., announced to-day that
he will build a model village near Kansas
City. The land has already been pur
chased, but he will not make public the
location until next week." .
The village will be a town with, a dozen
factories running within a few months.
It Â¦will have churches, schoolhouses,
dwellings, stores and places of amuse
ment, and all will be built at Vrooman a
will be built and conducted
along the lines suggested in a book re
centlv written by Professor John Dewey
of tb^TrnivcrsTly-of Chicago/* said Vroo
man. ~~lt will be more for the welfare of
children than grown people. There will
be playgrounds of all kinds, and one of
the principal buildings will be a house
where children can live under the care ot
vounjf women nurses and teacherE.
Vrooman said that he will open twenty
five co-operative stores in Kansas City
within a few weeks.
"I have already decided upon the loca
tion of twenty of the stores," he said.
"They will be opened at once. The fac
rories in the model village will produce
articles that will tte sold In the stores.
Vrooman Is making arrangements for
what he calls "co-operative revival
week," which begins May 12. He has
leased the Century Theater for thejveek
and free performances will be given by
the Walter Jefferson Dramatic Company.
Walter Jefferson is a' nephew of Joseph
Jefferson. A large tent will be erected
near the theater and "overflow meetings
will be held there. The Vrooman stores,
opened In Northern Missouri some time
ago are all thriving. Those In Trenton
ere the largest, as that place is one of the
strongholds of the "reformers.
Vrooman now has offices in the Century
building in this city, where he makes his
headquarters. The offices are elegantly
furnished and several clerks are kept
busy by Mr. Vrooman. who seems to nave
unlimited means for carrying out his nu
merous enterprises. With his model vil
lage built and his Kansas City stores in
operation Vrooman will be at the head of
the greatest co-operation system in the
world. â¢ I ' *â¢ .. ." â¢
â¬j*clÂ«J Dispatch to The Call.
A strong protest will again be made to
the Board of Education as soon as the
.Merchants'- Association takes action Sec
retary King declined to Btate what his
recommendations would be.
"The residents of the district want a
schoolhouse erected where it will be most
convenient to a majority of the residents,"
said C. Stader yesterday. "The Edna
street site is too far away and almost in
accessible In winter. The, Board of Edu
cation seems tied up to the Edna-street
lot, but a school might as well be erected
on the property surrounding the House of
Correction. The land would at least have
the advantage of not costing the city
anything-, and would be more acceptable
to the -residents of the neighborhood, as
good roads now lead to it.
On behalf of the objectors to the Flood
avenue and Edna street site it is stated
that while 318 children are in the district
east of the two proposed sites only 100
are in the district to the west. Some of
the children attend the school in the dis
trict, others go to the Fairmount School,
but a majority go into schools further in
the city. As a solution to the proposition
it is new proposed to erect an eight-room
school building on one of the inside loca
tions and a four-room building on the
outer site. It is said this plan would
solve the difficulty and relieve the con
gestion In the Fairmount School. '-. .
One of the selected locations is at the
corner of â¢ Fulton^ and Joost avenues,,ex
tending to Liberty street, giving a pront
age on three streets. The lot Is irregu
lary shaped, but is about 200 by 175 feet
in size. The price asked is $7000. A cor
ner space of two lots can be had for an
additional price of $1500. Another site is
in the immediate vicinity of ' the old
power house of the San . Francisco . and
San Mateo Railway Company on Sunny
side avenue. Â¦ Residents of the district
claim that either of the latter two sites
would be acceptable, the price in; each
instance being approximately the same.
Some time ago the Castro Street and
Glen Park Improvement Club appointed
a committee to wait upon the Board of
Education, asking that body to give con
sideration to other sites more centrally
located. "While these . sites are more
costly and approximately the same in
area, the members of the club claim, that
either of them, is more accessible to the
children of the district than the one se
lected by the Board of Education.
Some time ago. a site at the corner of
Flood avenue and Edna street, consisting
of fourteen lots, was put on â¢ the market
at a price that would amount to $3200.
Subsequently this. was offered to the c!ty
for- $5200. an increase of $2000 over the
price: demanded from private purchasers.
The property is situated on. the hill to
the north of the House of Correction and
at the extreme end of the district. It is
the site favored by the Board of Educa
tion.
Residents of the Sunnyslde district arc
very much concerned over the location,
of a new schoolhouse in that section of
the city embraced between Brewster
street on the east and the House of Cor
rection on the west. At the request of a
number of the ' residents ' In " the district
Secretary L. M. King of the Merchants'
Association visited the various sites un
der consideration yesterday afternoon and
will make a report to the directors of the
association at a meeting to be held dur
ing: the week.

The Financier says: The etatemehtVof "the
New York Associated Banks for last week
showed the unexpectedly moderate gain of only
$660,100 in cash, of which $336,000 consisted
of specie and $523,500 legal tenders. The of
ficial report differs so materially from the
estimated movement of cash during the weeTi,
this estimate. Indicating a gain to the banks of
$2,034,000, that it leads to the belief that the
statement was made on decidedly rising aver
ages, and that the banks were really In a
much better condition as regards cash reserves
at the end of the we*k than appeared by the
official statement^ The receipts of gold from
San Francisco were large after the middle of
the week and an average of at least $500,000
on the total of about $1,000,000 received ought.
It would seem, have been recorded, whereas
the gain In specie was only 1336.000. It appears
likely, from the exhibit by the bank returns,
that the money required for the Louisville and
Nashville deal was obtained from Chicago and
other Western points through drafts" upon
those deposits of the interior banks which were
standing to their credit with their New York
correspondents. Jyjans of this deposited
money <would, of, course, not be reflected In the
loan item of the New York banks. The state
ment Shows a decrease of 54,087,200 In de
posits, whereas the loss .of loans, lesss the
gains In cash, called for a decrease of $5,030,
300 In deposits; consequently the statement Is
out of harmony. The reserve required, $1,146.
8CO, plus the gain In caÂ»hT"makes an increase
of S2,uO6,ftOO in surplus reserve, dairying this
Item to $6,578,650. At the corresponding date
last year the surplus was $14,922,100. It Is
noteworthy that the Improvement in. the sur
plus, as was the case in the previous week, re
sulted not from the gain in cash, which was
small, but from the reduction In loans and
consequently in deposit?, indicating praise
worthy conservatism on the part of bank of
ficers, influenced by the peculiar situation In
cident to the prevailing speculative conditions.
The contraction of loans by the banks seemed
to be quite general. Eleven of the larger In
stitutions showed a net decrease in this item
of *5.100,Â«l00. Two of this number reduced
loans S3.S00,000 and one increased them $1,000,
000. The bank clearings for the week were un
usually heavy, amounting to $1,750,118,750,
and they were largely due to the enormous
trading in stocks.

SAN FRANCISCO. April 19-^ p. m
(120th Meridianâ Pacific Time.)
Weather Report.
"During the past wetk cold showers, hail,
enow and sleet have greatly delayed plowing
and seeding. In the earliest -localities of the
Eastern section, spring wheat is about three
fourths sown; ncne is germinated yet. Spring
barley is coming up in Columbia County. Over
the Western section very little spring seeding
and planting have been done."
"Some j>each. apricot, plum and cherry trees
have come into bloom, but most fruit trees arc
late in blossoming, which is considered for
tunate, as there have been hard frosts, which
vould have greatly injured the bloom.
"March, although wet in the Western section,
Tvas dry over the great agricultural region of
the Eastern section, which Is unfavorable for
cropn. The first two weeks of April, as well
as the last two of March, have been cold for
vhe season, and the spring is therefore late
and vegetation of sli kinds backward.
1 "Although the past winter was generally
Imild. with an abundance of rainfall, fall wheat
has not. except in the most favorable instances,
ccme through the winter in so good condition
as in former average seasons. There are two
reasons for it; first, only the early-sown fall
â¢wheat came up evenly and grew rapidly, the
October wheat having been sown when it was
too dry to germinate and grow rapidly; second,
& severe northwest storm on the i'4th of Janu
ary blew many fields completely bare of ,snow,
especially on the high lands, so that the Wheat
was ba<31y frozen oat (luring the sevej-e cold
spell that followed. Over large areas half of
the fail wheat had to be resown.

ern preferred and Minneapolis and St. Louis
made unexplained advances. The Important
developments this week In the stock market
have caused great animation and a feverish
tone. The actual accomplishments have given
rise to the usual flood of surmises of other
projects in formation or far advanced toward
fruition and the group of Western millionaires
whose operations started the present move
ment have maintained an aggressive leader
ship of the market. The result has been a
progressive growth in .speculative feeling *nd
a broadening in the field of activity. The ex
ample of the successful lifting of prices by the
leaders has encouraged friends of many other
stocks to take them In hand and work up a
ready market for them, . which has. afforded a
growing opportunity for the operations of pro
fessional operators. Judged by the expressed
opinions of commission-houses the growth of
interest on the part of the general public has
been moderate. The present market seems
to be one of millionaires, who deal in lines
of hundreds of thousands of shares. The party
which leads the market is undoubtedly made
up of millionaires who deal in concert or In
pool. There seems to be ample ground fcr
the supposition that the passing of control
of Louisville and Nashville, wlllch was the
feature of the week, was an Incident rather
than the object ! of these speculative opera
tions. The passing of control of a great rail
road system in the open market aealnst* the
desire of a centralized interest which has dom
inated the property Is calculated to create a
degree of disturbance and uncertainty that
would serve to unset the market and check
the upward progress of prices elsewhere. For
one thing there is the mass of contracts ' for
delivery which have been ventured In the at
tractive upward rush of prices, for which stock
has been borrowed until certificates can be se
cured for a definitive closing of the contract.
If there is any doubt of the ability of sellers
to make delivery the existing control in the
property will naturally refuse to admit the
contestant's claim to control and will buy In
the market to defeat that claim. In the North
ern Pacific contest lait year It was this pro
cess that swept the" market bare of stock and
precipitated a corner. On Monday of this
week the Â«ame flaw of affairs was imminently
threatened in Louisville and Nashville. It is
clear that the contestant was Induced to re
linquish his claim to control and consent to
its lodgment with J. P. Morgan & Co. Jyet
what the inducement for this action was Is a
puzzle to the speculative public and has given
rise to much surmise and feverish speculation,
based on this or that assumption of what the
quid pro quo may be. The unprecedented deal
ings in Southern Railway on Tuesday, break
ing all Stock Exchange records for a day's
dealings in a single stock, were based on the
supposition of a merger or an agreement for
an exchange of interests in the two roads
with the new interest in Louisville and Nash
ville. Another supposition, was that the re
linquiihment of the newty acquired control of
Louisville and Nashville (was prompted by the
danger threatened of tn'upsfit in the general
market in which the same Interest was largely
committed. The renewal of the larce specu
lative operations was attributed, in this con
nection, to the replenishment of speculative
resources whtch resulted from the settlement
of the Louisville and Xaehvllle matter. That
the controlling Influence in the Southern Rail
way field has been /centralized as a result of
the episode goes without saying and It is ac
cepted as a demonstration of the sweeping
tendency of the times. General conditions have
been almost totally Ignored during the week.
The conservation of the steadiness of the
money market has been an important factor
In fostering the strength of the stock market.
The Interior has sent money to New York this
week and the sub-treasury drain on the mar
ket has been suspended owing to theJ pending
payments. The money rate has remained suf
ficiently high to invite further lending here
by foreign houses in spite of the demand upon
the markets incident to the iMue of the new
British loan. The large overÂ«ib*criptlon of
that loan 1* evidence of the abundance of cap
ital seeking investment. The lone dreaded re
duction In the Amalgamated dividend passed
almost unnoticed in the general animation of
the market.

CHICAGO, April lO.r-Wheat was ruled , by
the weather. ' The people -who sold' late yes

riedly at' the opening^ when' dryness "was re
ported again and caused a^ sharp advance.'. The
email Northwestern and primary receipts also
caused some alarm toshorts and induced good
buying at times;. Traders were j firm in the
belief that the whole feature of- wheat' prices
hinges on the" moisture that' may ;or may not
come to the relief | of the winter crop . in the
next ten days. For. some days the dry weather
has been discussed and as days go by without
the needed rain the situation 1 grows more criti
cal and complex. : Southwestern news ' is : gen
erally bullish, i Â¦ Not only . Is the winter j crop
full of dangerous possibilities, but the story ia
now pretty generally circulated that there will
be a very serious shrinkage \ in the area.,-, of
spring wheat in the three Northwestern States.
Cash wheat is growing scarce here and In the
Interior and this consideration Â¦ caused holders
to stand firm ' to-day. . No shipping ' business
was done here to-day and the export demand
at the seaboard was called poor. These worked
against the early upturn, but .-exceptionally

â¢'The local crowd on reported rains: in. the
Southwest % went - home i short of . wheat last
night, and as a result there was active cover
ing in initial dealings this morning, which re
sulted in a higher opening. The weather map
showed no rains of consequence over the â¢ win
ter wheat belt, and while the barometer indi
cates . a possible j) change in . the weather Â¦ by
Monday . there is nothing Â¦ to . indicate that . the
much-needed ; rain will . be forthcoming. There
was heavy selling throughout the session by a
leading local â¢ operator. Buying was . scattered
and of a local character, the large offerings
having been almost .wholly absorbed by local
scalpers. â¢ - The market is a weather one and
in : the absence of - general rains over Sunday
we shall not be surprised to see higher prices
Monday morning.^ Should rain come prices will
no doubt yield, but unless it is general we- be
lieve that on any . break wheat should be
bought." Â¦*.,.-' ! . , ::Â¦' ..".Â¦Â¦ â¢ -- *-"

scattered i and Â¦' insignificant, " the ' heaviest ( fall

whole I West - was clear and , cool, with . a clear

with, more 'buyers than ..sellers, though ;ths

MAGNITUDE OF THE PLANS.
The Mining Record for April says: "The
great scope and importance - of the Tacoma
Company require careful study to be even par-
tially appreciated. The magnitude of the plans,
fast materializing, is bewildering to the or-
dinary individual,- being comprehensible only
by those who have seen similar great metal-
lurgical Industries carried to successful issue.
"Since the formation of the company the
securing, through lease and purchase, by them
of valuable and extensive coal, copper and
iron properties has been of almost weekly oc- -
currence. Their last two 'purchases of iron
properties In British Columbia are valued by
the company at $1,000,000 each, although not
costing them any such figure. At the present
moment it may be safely asserted that the Ta-
coma Company owns the largest iron deposits
and most extensive coal fields on- the Coast j
in addition to valuable producing copper prop-
erties. By conservative estimate their mineral
holdings are worth fully $5,000,000.
"The plans of the company contemplate the
erection at Tacoma of coke ovens, blast fur-
naces, rolling mills, a tlnplate factory and
other -allied Industrial plants. With such ob-
jects in view this great steel and coke com-
; pany has secured a very advantageous site of
1200 acres, on deep water, near Tacoma. and
on the Northern Pacific Railroad. They will
first erect 100 coke ovens and construct an
Initial blast furnace having a daily capacity of
300 tons, to be followed later by the blowing
in of. additional .furnaces and multiplication of
coke ovens, .erection of. rolling mills, tin plata
factory, etc*. Ground will be broken on the
site within the next thirty days."
WHAT THE DISPATCHES SAY.
The.'' San Francisco Chronicle of April 15 :
"Though the presence of iron on Texada and
some adjacent islands has long been known, no
one dreamed of the size s.nd number of veins
which cross them. Several months ago Henry
Hewitt, a millionaire lumber man of Tacoma,
began investigating 'the subject His re-
searches astonished him. Throwing aside other
business cares, he has employed tugs and ex-
pert Iron men to explore the region named.
Ore bodies covering nearly thirty islands have
already been secured by purchase and option.
For three weeks Hewitt has not been heard
from, being out on a tug - secured quietly at
Vancouver." Mr. Hewitt Is the active presi-
dent of- the Tacoma Company. ,
Dispatch in the San Francisco Call of April
14: "The most important mineral discovery of
years has been ! made during the past sixty,
days. Great bodies of hematite, magnetic and
specular iron ore have been uncovered on nu-
merous islands of British Columbia and South-
eastern Alaska. The most Important deposits
have been secured at low figures by purchasing
outright or by options by men who have under-
taken the establishment of an Immense iron
and steel plant At the head of the syndicate
Is Henry Hewitt, the largest Individual owner
of timber lands in this State. For three weeks
he. with cruisers and experts,- has been out on
a British tug making further explorations and
securing options."

"REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS;
Just a nice little' shock of earthquake
about ' 8 110 o'clock yesterday morning
awoke late slumberers, rattled breakfast
dishes and scared timid housekeepers.
Buildings swayed and rocked, and in some
of. the higher office -buildings clerks and
stenographers rushed into hallways and
wondered what was up. Although the
shock was not severe, it was sufficiently
so to cause many people to think that a
big explosion had occurred. The earth
quake was not felt very far from the
city, the Western Addition seeming 1 to be
the center of the disturbance. The seis
mometer at the Lick Observatory on
Mount ..Hamilton failed to give 'any rec
ord. The record at "the University Ob
servatory at Berkeley Indicated that tbe
direction of the shock was- from north
west to southeast. - The displacement of
the earth's crust- during the principal vi
brations amounted to .17 of a millimeter.
Dishes and Causes Much Confu
sion for Few Seconds* .
Earthquake Disturbs the Breakfast
EAULY MORNING SHOCK
SOABES THE TIMOROUS
It is urged that a sufficient number of
policemen be appointed .to patrol the
whole inhabited portion of San Francisco.
The Board of "Supervisors is requested, to
make suitable provision for this purpose
In the approaching tax levy.
It is stated that San Francisco has less
police protection, proportionately, than
most other large 'cities in the country.
The special needs of this city. In view of
the character of certain classes of tran
sient visitors, particularly soldiers, sailors
and indigents, are set forth. It is claimed
that members of the association have as
certained that not only are many large
portions of the city inadequately pa
trolled, but that certain residence dis
tricts are wholly without police protec
tion. . ' . ' .
At the regular meeting of the board ot
directors of the~ Merchants'. Association,
heM yesterday,- -resolutions favoring an
increase in the municipal police force
were unanimously adopted and sent to
