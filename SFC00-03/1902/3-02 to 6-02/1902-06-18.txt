. The news of Tubbs" untimely death was
a. 5-liock not only to the members of his
family, but to a host of his friends in
Oakland. He had spent most of his life
in this city, having been born here 34
years ago at the Tubbs home in East
Oakland, where the family settled nearly
half a century ago. He was educated In
the Oakland public schools and here grew
to manhood. His future had In large
measure been cut out for him, because of
his father's connection with the TubbsÂ«
Cordage Company, an extensive manufac
turing institution of San Francisco and
one of Its pioneer industries. It was
founded by the late Hiram Tubbs, the
young man's father, and A. L. Tubbs, an
uncle. A cousin of the decedent. Alfred
Tubbs, is now the president of the con

an active member of Oakland Lodge No.

Elks.
As a leader of the Reliance Athletic
Club, Tubbs gave it more than liberal
financial support and In no small measure
was responsible for its revival and the
position it now occupies. The Reliance
Gun Club, one of the auxiliaries of tha
parent institution, was largely patronized
by the deceased.

Mrs. Tubbs was a widow when she

"All I can say at this time,", said Mr.
Lovell, "is that there is no question about
Mr. Tubbs' marriage. I know that this is
a "fact, but further than that I cannot

The reason for the secrecy is not made

confidence. It is said that he had desired
his intimates not to disclose the fact be
cause, of family concerns. . Whatever the
cause, it Is a certainty that most careful
injunction was placed upon those who

French cruiser Euchet and the German

bombardment. The firing had proceeded
only a short time when the commanders
of both the foreign vessels sent word to
the commanders of the Venezuelan pun
beats thai fuither bombardment could
take place only at thfir own peril, and
by* this threat the firing was immediately
silenced. This information would serve
to expia:n why the bombardment of that
port, which began with such gusto, came
to naught.

ABE STILL REPUBLICANS.
Senator Elkins, chief of the "boxer"
contingent, said:
There is a strong sentiment in both
branches of Congress in favor of the an
nexation of the island. Senator Platt of
New' York said to-day that he was posi
tive that a hill to annex Cuba would pass

and believes that sentiment in favor of

he. "We have not been making war on
the administration as charged, but we
have been doing what we believe our
duty to the Republican party. We
honestly believe that the legislation pro
posed for /concessions to Cuba will be
hurtful to American interests ana" of lit
tle or no practical benefit to Cuban sugar
.growers."
ANNEXATION SENTIMENT.
Whether concessions to Cuba can be ac
complished through a commercial treaty
is uncertain. Representatives of the beet
sugar industry said to-day that a reci
procity treaty would be as objectionable
as the reciprocity bill, if it provided for
20 per cent reduction in the tariff. They
oppose a change in the existing tariff,
but would favor a commercial treaty that
would provide for a 20 per cent drawback,
rebate or bounty, to be paid by the
United States to Cuba and distributed
by. the Cuban'Government to cane grow
ers and sugar producers of the- island.
President Roosevelt, President Palma,
Secretary Root and General Wopd agree
that a rebate is impracticable and re
fuse to consider the proposition.
The result is very plainly a distinct re
buft for the administration. No explana
tion that the Cuban bill was merely a
measure' supported by Roosevelt because
President McKlnley would have advo
cated it can change the fact. .
Should this resolution be adopted, that
will end the matter. There will be no
party split and no public discussion on
the floor of the Senate.

ident should handle the question of com

ly and negotiate a treaty to be considered
at the next session of the Senate.
Senator Allison, as chairman of the
Committee on Order of Business, has
ca!leÂ«l a conference of the Republican
Senators for to-morrow night. This will
result in the abandonment of the Spooner
substitute and of Cuban legislation gen
erally. The conference will be held behind

ments for the â¢ obsequies of the Cuban
reciprocity bill were virtually perfected
to-day. In accordance with the pro
gramme outlined this morning in The
Call, which told of the death of the bill,
the Republican members of the Commit
tee on Cuba met to-da^ and adopted the
Spooner substitute. This provides for a
20 per cent reduction in tho duty on im
ports from Cuba into' the United States,
in return for an equivalent reduction by
"Cuba oft goods imported from the United
States. The reduced duty is to remain in
force not longer than five years, and the
President is required to assure -himself
that the reduction, so far as sugar and
tobacco are concerned, is to benefit thn
producers in Cuba and not purchasers in
the United States.

This morning it was officially an

ter. He passed a good night and his pro
gress toward complete recovery was un
interrupted. The measures
ordered by his physicians are said to bÂ»
due to the necessity of husbanding hla
strength in view of the fatigues of the

he intended to open with all the state

LONDON, June 17.â A sensational story
is current in London to-night of the dis
covery of a plot to assassinate Kins Ed
ward. This story has created much dis
cussion in newspaper and other circles,
but it is lacking in anything like official
confirmation.
According to the current report. King
Edward's sudden illness at Aldershot was
not due to cold, but was merelv an ex
cuse â¢ for withdrawing his Majesty from
public functions, owing to the discovery
by Scotland Yard of a plot against hl3 life.
The principals in thi3 plot have not yet
been arjrested. It is cited in confirmation
of this story that King Edward's recov
ery when he was ensconced at Windsor
Castle was as complete and speedy as hla
attack had been sudden.
On the other hand, it must be pointed out
that if his Majesty's illness was merely
diplomatic, the officials carefully took a
great deal of trouble in keepinc up the
fiction. Sir Francis Laking, physician in
ordinary to the King, was summoned by
telegraph to Aldershot; his prescriptions
were hurriedly filled, and everything about
the King's apartments indicated the gen
uine nature of the King's illness. Fur
thermore^ -King Edward's journey from
Aldershot to Windsor in his motor car and
his subsequent drive to-day in Windsor
Park do not seem to. Indicate any fear of
a further attack upon his person.

CHICAGO, June 17.â An advance of
over three cents in -the price of July
corn enlivened speculative trade in gfain
to-day. Opening at 64^ cents, the price
was rushed up to ,66% cents within the
first hour of trading, and much excite
ment accompanied tne advance.
Shorts were responsible for the sharp
rise in the price of the golden cereal. Un
easy over the stubborn manner in which
the New York bull crowd trading through
Harris Gates and other big houses has
protected its July holdings,' traders who
had corn : sold, for nex.t month's Â¦ delivery
engaged in further -covering in the course
of which they were forced to bid prices
up sharply on themselves. Not until the
price had advanced more than one cent
was there much- corn -for sale, and then
offerings were not sufficient to meet the
requirement of the shorts. Harris Gates
sold out a little long corn from time to
time, but not enough to affect the pricp
much. The shorts continued, to cover
late in the day, and July sold to 6714
cents, closing at that price.
Much Excitement Accompanies an

miuiiimiiiillllliiiillllliiiiiiiilM^^^ALWAYS IN" THE RIGHT.
Before the sun had sunk to rest on that
eventful 17th day of June, 1775, those thir
teen colonies had .found the Inspiration of a
new nation, and conceived the hope and had
established the nucleus of a glorious na
tional existence.
From the day of Bunker Hill we have never
swerved from national right and national right
dealing. Whatever territory we have acquired;
whatever history we have made; whatever ideas
and principles we have established, have been
along these lines. And God â¢ grant that none
other shall ever actuate our statesmen, our
Government or our people.
Fellow Americans, the sword of Bunker Hill
flashed a message to the nations of the earth,
a mesEage of liberty, and of national manhood;
that message has not been dimmed by. the ad
vancing years, nor has it lost any of its bright
ness or luster from its reflection; repeated
from ocean 'to ocean and from State to State.
It unites the descendants of Pilgrim Fathers
on Massachusetts rock bound shores with the
descendants of California's pioneers and with
the pioneers themselves, in this land of sun-'
shine, fruit and flowers, and on this anniver
sary day it proves the Inspiration and the oc
casion of thousands of these ' patriotic Ameri
can reunions held In every State. ':
Gentlemen of the Associated Societies, I
thank you indeed for the honor and privilege
of being with you to-day. I can be no better
American, but I shall certainly take with me
hence the most pleasant memories and the true
significance of a great and united American
ism. (Applause.)
WINNERS OF RACES.
After another patriotic selection by the
band, Miss Juliet Greninger sang' "The
Star Spangled Banner." This was fol
lowed by a cornet solo by H. Dibbin and
a tenor solo by Daniel Lawrence. Chair
man Badger read a telegram from a Bos
ton society and then called upon the audi
ence to render "America" and every voice
Joined in singing the ode. The exercises
closed with a benediction by Father
Lacey. .
After luncheon there was dancing' until
5 o'clock. The races proved very inter
esting. The winners in the various events
were: -
Children under 8 â Carroll Colley first, Carl
Weener second.
Upon arrival at the picnic grove the
literary exercises were inaugurated. The
programme opened with a grand medley
of patriotic airs by the Second Regiment
Band. This was followed by a prayer de
livered by Rev. T. J. Lacey. William G.
Badger, president of the day, delivered
some appropriate opening remarks. He
dwelt at length on the occasion that
brought them together and expressed the
hope that all would enjoy themselves. At

wnen the noise had ceased the city's chief
executive spoke in part as follows:
In this lovely place, where every attraction
of nature calls upon those who love her to
enjoy her gracious smiles and her delightful
welcome and to forget, for a time our city
habits and all urban restrictions a lengthy
address would. I fear, seem incongruous; yet
the spirit of the day. whose anniversary we
now celebrate and which is still so strong and
so fresh in the American heart that wherever
Americans congregate, whether in the crowded
city or in the open country; whether amid the
busy cares of life or in our moments of freest
case there is ever room for pauseâ time to
consider and to recall with wonder and with
admiration the birth of our American inde
pendence, and the growth and progress of our
American principles and our American institu
tions.
One hundred and twenty-seven years ago to
day that sun which now In splendor, shines
upon forty-six sovereign States of a united and
forever indissoluble country, rose as it were

To rescue the man and woman was
more difficult. Craig could not lift them
and Smith finally jumped into the court
and braving the intense heat lifted first
the woman and then the man to Craig,
who pulled them through the window.
Smith was rescued a moment later by
the firemen.
Craig and Smith knew of this court and
going to an adjoining building tried to
reach the imprisoned family from win
dows ten feet from the ground. Finally
Craig threw himself backward out of the
window and catching his feet in the cas
ing hung head downward while the ter
rorized mother passed her children to
him.
In the rear of the place is a small court,
six by eight feet, and on the same level
as ' the floor. Into this brick inclosed
place, the family retreated. Soon the
flames began shooting from the windows
behind them and they had to hug the
cement floor.
LOS ANGELES, June 17.â The heroism

Morris Dench at 335 North Main street.
Dench, his wife and two children, aged 2
and 5 years, were sleeping In the rear of
the store. They were awakened by the
heat, but there was no way out of the
building except through the store, which
was a mass of flames.

TWO BRAVE MEN SAVE
LIVES OF FOUR PERSONS
An investigation to-day developed that
more than a score of persons who par
took of the social- refreshments suffered
an attack and still others who had eaten
but lightly were strangely distressed af
ter retiring. Those who partook of only
the sherbet was not affected. The ice
cream caused the trouble. The physicians
believe that the vanila with which the
icecream was flavored caused the sick
ness. It was purchased on the day of th.3
pceial by the preparation committee. All
of the guests affected have now fully re
covered.
REDDING. June 17.â The Bunker Hill
social given by the Ladies' Aid Society of
the Methodist church at the W. M. Cum
mings home on Pine street last night was
largely . attended and the guests partooK
of icecream and pineapple sherbet be
neath lantern-Illuminated trees on the
lawn. They dispersed at 11 o'clock.
Soon after midnight the telephone bells
In doctors' houses set up a chime. The
medicine men were wanted in many parts
of town by persons who had been guests
at the social. The doctors found their
patients suffering from the effects of
poisoning.
J. R. Howell of East street and his
wife and little daughter were seriously af
fected. Dr. C. H. Wheeler found difficulty
In bringing relief to Mrs. HoweU and the
little one. Mr. Howell suffered less acute
ly. Charles Stever of South Market
street was attacked by violent cramps.
As his wife was attending him she was
suddenly stricken with the same aliment.
Then Miss Lola Stever ran to her par
ents' relief, but she, too, was soon very
ill. Lawrence Stever defied his own pain
and summoned help.
Special IMspatch to The CalL
The convicts have the advantage of be
ing perfectly familiar with the country,
Merrill having been reared here. The
country is admirably adapted to their pur
poses, being thickly covered with brush.
The officers, however, regard as excellent
their chance of capturing the desperadoes
during the next twelve hours.
At 8 o'clock this morning Deputy War
den Carson arrived from Walla Walla
with bloodhounds. Carson, with the dogs,
left here at 9 o'clock with Sheriff Marsh,
Sheriff Cook of Clackamas County, Detec
tives Kerrigan, Day, Snow and several
others, from Portland, and forty or fifty
armed men. including Captain Sparks and
twenty volunteer? from Company G, Na
tional Guard of Washington.
BLOODHOUNDS ON THAIL.
They had gone but a short distance
â¢when three rifle shots eame from the
brush near the roadside, and the guards
drove for their lives. Five bullets were
gent after them. The first struck a horse
end passed under Blesecker's right arm,
cutting a clean hole through the side of
his coat; another wounded a horse in the
head, a third grazed a horse's side, and a
fourth cut through the harness. The men
reached town soon after 2 o'clock and re
ported to Sheriff Marsh.
A battle occurred about 2 o'clock this
morning between Bert Biesecker and Lon
Davis, two members of Sheriff Marsh's
posse, and Tracy and Merrill, in which
eleven rifle shots were exchanged. Bie
zsecker had a narrow escape, his clothing
'being pierced by a bullet. At 11 o'clock
last night Biesecker and Davis Baw two
men go down to Salmon Creek and get a
drink at a point about six miles north of
Vancouver. The watchers were not cer
tain of the identity of the pair and halted
until the latter again approached the
road. The guards then advanced and
when about thirty yards distant Biesecker
sent a rifle shot in the direction of the
supposed convicts. The fire was prompt
ly returned and six shots were exchanged,
rone of which took effect, so far as
known.
Both parties then took to cover. After
â¢waiting in their hiding place for more
than an hour, the guards moved up a
quarter of a mile, where their horses were
tied. They again lay in wait another half
hour, in t'he hope of seeing the fugitives,
but nothing occurred ana they got into
their burgJ' and started toward town.
The posse came up scarcely an hour
afterward and at once started in hot pur
6ult Several miles beyond Pioneer Church
the track of the fugitives was lost, but
Is Delieved they passed the main road
leading off the Pioneer road to La Center
and continued north along a trail through
the woods, which follows the Lewis River
toward Lewisville.
EABLY MORNING BATTLE.
VANCOUVER, Yfash.. June 17.â Tracy
and Merrill, the murderous convicts, who
have been chased for eight days, are still
at large to-night, but a posse in charge of
Sheriff Marsh of Clark County Is close
en their heels near La Center, a village
twenty miles from Vancouver. The fugi
tives were seen several times during the
Â«iay and at 7:30 o'clock a telephone mes
sage from Sheriff Marsh at La Center an
nounced that they had passed Pioneer
Church, six miles southeast of La Center
and fourteen miles from here, late in the
afternoon. They were on horseback, hav
ing stolen two horses from 'the farm of
John Rathburn after ' holding up Rath
burn's father-in-law, William Kauzler.
After securing the horses the outlaws
rode rapidly to Pioneer Church, two
miles west, and then turned north in the
direction of La Center and Lewisville, on
Lewis River.
The blaze started in the varnishing or
finishing room on the fourth floor and
spread with unusual quickness to the
other floors, which were packed with the
most inflammable sort of material in the
shape of furniture, rattan, baby carriages
and go-carts. For two hours the firemen
fought the flames from places of danger,
finally subduing them, but not until the
building had been rendered a mere shell
of four walls.
The Heywood Brothers & Wakefleld
Company is a wholesaler of furniture,
with factories in San Francisco. Chicago
and Gardner and Wakefleld, Mass. As
sistant Manager Skellenger said that fif
teen carloads of furniture had just been
placed in the building as part of the stock.
The building was 100 by 1*0 feet in dimen
sions, four stories high, and was owned by
O. T. Johnson of this city.
LOS ANGELES, June 17.â One of the
fiercest blazes the local fire department
has had to deal with in a long time occur
red between 7 and 8 o'clock to-night. The
four-story brick building at the southeast
corner of Seventh and Main streets, used
as a furniture warehouse and occupied by
the Heywood Brothers & Wakefleld Com
pany, was entirely destroyed, together
with its contents. The loss on the stock
is given at about $125,000, and on the build
ing at $35,000. Both were fully insured.
A second theory has to do with the do
mestic troubles of Mrs. Moore. Shs is a
married woman with two young children,
but some time ago her husband deserted
her. He was regarded as a shiftless fel
low. Several days ago Moore was re
ported to have been seen In this county. It
is the opinion of a few that there la some
connection between hia reappearance and
Sunday night's affair. Mrs. Moore could
not identify her assailant in. the darkness
and was too excited to give a description
of him.
Several theories are given as to the
cause o* the assault. For the past few
weeks Nevada women have been ter
rorized by an unknown man, who at
tacks them on dark streets. It is believed
this man was the assailant of Mrs. Moore.
NEVADA, June 17.â Mrs. EUhu Moore, a
young woman of this city, was brutally
attacked by an unknown man late Sun
day night. Mrs. Moore was on her way
home from town and was passing a de
serted spot on the road when suddenly a
man appeared ahead of her. Before she
could call for help or attempt to escape
the fellow had seized her and waa at
tempting: to hurl her to the ground. Mrs.
Moore Is possessed of strength and fear
steeled her muscles. The struggle was
desperate. Finally, with an almost super
human effort, she broke from his grasp,
but not until her clothing was torn from
her body. Mrs. Moore ran up the road and
managed to elude her brutal pursuer until
she reached home. She was In an ex
hausted condition, but managed to tell her
story sufficiently to make clear the cause
of her pitiable plight.
As soon as possible the young woman's
father, Levi Nicholson, who is employed
in the Champion mine, was Informed and
a posse started in search of the assailant.
Its efforts were not successful and tha
culprit is still at large.

met last night and decided to hold the an
nual summer flower show In the grand
nave of the Ferry building from August
14 to 16. After the closing night of the
show there will be a grand promenade
concert in the ferry building. Music will
be furnished by a superb band of sixteen
pieces. The committee in charge is striv
ing to make the coming show a success,
and judging from the amount of interest
taken in the venture it should eclipse any
thing of its kind ever before held under
the auspices of the society. The society
has accepted the invitation extended by
John Rock, an extensive florist of Niles,
to visit his place on July 6. A grand re
union and outing will take place and new
achievements in the culture of flowers
will be discussed.

Al Neill and Young Gibbs have not
signed articles to fight before the Twen
tieth Century Club this month. The club
officials have not posted their forfeit and
the boxers are afraid the fight cannot be
held under the law. There will be an
other conference to-day. -
Ed Neaves is also bringing out a num
ber of greyhounds formerly owned by
Russell, Allen & Wilson. They are all
carefully selected and are expected to
prove high-class performers.
Jimmie Britt has been matched to fight
Perry Queenan in Portland early next
month. Queenan has defeated Dal Haw
kins and others recently.
William McCaffrey, the trainer, is com
ing West with Ralph Orthwein's kennel
of greyhounds from St. Louis. Sisquoc
and others are in the string. They will
remain until late in the year.
A meeting of the San Francisco Scot
tish Bowling Club will be held Friday

Sports Jottings.
Joe Carroll secured the decision over
Joe Hall after four rounds. Hall's game
ness was his only qualification.
Jerry Kenny and Perry Walker fur
nished the comedy element of the even
ing. Walker could not fight and ran
around the ring to avoid the attacks of
Kenny. Referee McDevitt stopped the
comedy in the third.
Lew Powell stopped Charles Augustus
in three rounds. The latter was down
eight seconds and his seconds threw up
the sponge to save him from punishment.
Pete Manning defeated Jimmy Little
after four desperate rounds. They ex
changed blow for blow throughout and
it seemed the fight would end any mo
ment. Manning was game and won in
the last few moments of the contest. '
Joe Reilly beat Ed Parker after one of
the greatest fights ever seen at one of
the minor clubs. Reilly proved a verit
able fighting machine and never gave
Parker a moment's rest. The fourth round
was all fighting, with Reilly doing the
most effective work. This -won him. the
decision. Â¦
The winner did the cleanest hitting in
the first, third and fourth rounds. He
set a whirlwind pace in the first and was
all over. Attell. The latter evened mat
ters up in the second round. Driscoll then
forced the fighting until the end, with At
tell always ready to mix matters.
Barney Driscoll was given the decision
over Monte Attell in a four-round boxing
bout last night in Mechanics' Pavilion
Annex. The judges -called it a draw. As
this is not permitted under the rules,
Referee McDevitt properly cast the de
ciding vote in favor of Driscoll.

stake Ard Patrick, the Derby winner,
was a hot favorite at 2 to 1 on. The
horses finished as follows: The Duke of
Westminster's Cup Bearer (M. Cannon)
won; J. Gubbins' Ard Patrick (Martin),
second; Arthur James' Perseus (Maher),
third. Seven horses started. An objec
ti6n was lodged against Cup Bearer on
the ground of bumping and boring. The
stewards sustained the objection and Ard
Patrick, who was three-fourths of a
length behind, was awarded the race. The
Duke of Devonshire's Cheers, ridden by
Spencer, was placed third.

Baldness follows falling hair, falling
hair follows dandruff and dandruff Is the
result of a eerrn digging Its way Into the
scalp to the root of the hair, where lt
saps the vitality of the hair. To destroy-
that germ is to prevent as well as cure
dandruff, falling hair and, lastly, bald-
ness. There Is only one preparation known
to do that, Newbro's Herplclde. an en-
tirely new, scientlflo discovery. Wherever
it has been tried it has proven wonder-
fully successful. It can't be otherwise,
because it utterly destroys the dandruff

the city's printing, Charles Marshall,,
representative of the H. S. Crocker Com
pany, one of the bidders for the contract,
and W. W. Copeland, representing tbe
Typographical Union, got into a discus

The Pacific Coast Electric Transmission
Association opened its sixth annual con
vention yesterday in the maple room oÂ£
the Palace Hotel. Dr. Charles Van Nor
den of the Central California Electric
Company and president of the association,
after bidding the delegates welcome, de
livered his annual address, in which he
alluded to his prediction ' made . at
the convention held at Highgate
Falls, Vt.. that in a few years
from. that time the cataract of the neigh
borhood would in no short period furnish
light and power to nearby villages, none
nearer than nine miles. He then dis
cussed several problems which he con
sidered of vast importance.
r>r. Van Norden said In part:
The risk from labor troubles is not the least
of the factors In our equation. Linemen' and
station keepers have us at their mercy even
more so than motormen and conductors have
a city railroad. Already the linemen have
struck for the eight hour day and three dol
lar wage.-- Success may breed and encourage
larger demands. Allied to the growing menace
of organized labor is the seething of the com
munistic tendencies of the times. - Foremost
among the schemes urged 'is that of municipal
ownership of . public utilities. This we . need
not fear, since municipalities need our cheap
power. For us a far more dangerous agitation
is that which ..now proposes State appropria
tion of all water rights. Â¦ The scheme advocated
makes -the appropriation little less than sheer
confiscation. Indeed the movement is simply
an organization for public robbery on a large
scale. The agitation Is being vigorously pushed
in the name of progress, and the masses are
easily blinded as to their duties toward vested
rights and are often mislead Into extrava
gances. *
During the afternoon session the follow
ing papers were read:
''The Economy of Electric Power In ' Quarts
Mining," by C. O. Toole; 'The Application of
Electric Power In the Comstock Lode," by Leoo
M. Hall, and read -by George P. Low, and
"Electric Pumping From a 130O foot Level."
by Dcnald H. Fry.
In the evening the delegates listened to
studious. and eminently scientific papers
and also enjoyed stereoptlcon views pre
sented by Professor Alexander McAdle.
The professor announced that two weeks
ago last Sunday this city did itself proud
inasmuch as it beat all known records in
the velocity of the wind. On that day
the wind blew, at a rate not less than 125
miles an hour at Point Lobos, which was
a much higher velocity than attained at
Galvcston at. the time of the memorable
disaster. "So as a windy city," said Pro
fessor. McAdie, "San Francisco passes
Chicago or Boston.'.' Hia paper was en
titled "Cloud Versus Coal."
A. J. Bowie. Jr. read a paper entitled
"Wells in Large Ranges." "The Hy
draulic End of Power Transmissions"
was the title of a paper by John S. East

Gustav Saulr, who claims he belongs to
the Seventh Infantry, was arrested yes
terday by Detective Reynolds and Police
man Collins and locked up in "the tanks"
pending an investigation. He visited a
money broker on Kearny street, near Sac
ramento, and asked to have a draft for
$90, drawn on the First National Bank
of Portland, cashed. The broker was sus
picious of the draft and notified the
police.
An examination showed that the draft
had originally been for $10 and had been
clumsily raised to $30. Across the draft
the words. "Not over ninety dollare,"
were stamped, but It could be seen that
the original stamp was "Not over ten
dollars."
When searched at the City Prison an
other draft, raised from $10 to $90. one
from. $10 to $50 and a genuine draft for
$25, all dated April 5 last, were found in
his possession.
ATTEMPTS TO PASS
BAISED BANK DMPT
M. de I*. Hadley, business manager
of the Enquirer, was recalled to make
clear the bookkeeping methods in vogue
in the Enquirer office. A. J. Read of the)
job department of .the Enq.uirer and T-
M. Robinson, Assessor Dalton's chief dep
uty, were the new witnesses. They gava
testimony of an expert nature and only
entertained the Inquisitors a few minutes.
Neither Dalton nor Daniel3 ,were called. ,
George A. Oakes, the Haywards editor,
was the first one to receive a beckoning
from the jurymen. He told about a hur
ry-up move by which he got $800 from a
Haywards bank five or six weeks ago.
He needed the money, and is supposed, ta
have got a certain county official to help
him get it. Later in the day J. 1* Far
num of the Haywards Bank was called
to tell what he knew about the same
transaction. He was only held a few
minutes.
During the session of the Grand Jury
to-day three witnesses concerned in thÂ«Â»
investigation of the county's missing
books were recalled to clear up some; of
the mystifications surrounding that grand
disappearing transaction.

It is a peculiar fact that for the past
six years many more Chinese have been
landed, at- this port than Japanese, not
withstanding that there is an exclusion
law against Chinese and . none against
Japanese. . ;
There is no law prohibiting the contract
ing of laborers within the United States,
and : Hawaii -being a part of the United
States, is considered as a coastwise do
mestic port; therefore there is nothing to
hinder the entire Japanese population of
the islands from coming to this country
under labor contracts. . .
Captain Schell explained, further that
there is a popular misconception regard
ing Japanese immigrants. The truth is
that the Japanese immigrant stands on
the same footing as Irish, French, Ger
man or English immigrants, and there is
no exclusion law against them.
These people will be allowed' to enter. More
than that, their right to enter cannot be ques
tioned. We have no right to examine or In
terfere with them at all, no more than we have
to examine white persons coming from Missouri
or Oregon under contract to labor In California.
Hawaii Is a part of the United States, and we
do not board steamers coming from Honolulu or
Seattle.- We might as well interfere with Sac
ramento Valley farmers contracting with labor
ers in San Francisco.
Deputy Immigrant Commissioner Schell,
in speaking of the matter yesterday, said:
All of these coolies are coming under con
tract in violation of the Immigration laws
which strictly forbid the admission of contract
laborers. If these people are allowed to en
ter It will be. through some subterfuge devised
and adopted for the evasion of the immigration
laws.
Much amusement was created in the
United States Immigration Bureau over
an editorial in the morning issue of a
daily paper calling attention to the fact
that Japanese laborers under contract to
work in California were arriving and pre
paring to arrive at this port from Ha
waiian Territory. The editorial spates:

"The message which we received from
Santa Barbara this morning shows that a
new quarter Is affected by the grasshop
pers. It looks as if they would soon be all
over the farming districts of the State.
We hear that at Exeter, in Tulare Cour.
tv, they have the pest under control, but
in Placer, El Dorado and Sacramento
counties the measures taken for the sup
pression of the insects are entirely inade
quate and they are on the increase."
BERKELEY, June 17.â Professor E. W.
Hilgard, dean of the College of Agricul
ture at the University of California, re
ceived an appeal for aid from Santa Bar
bara to-day against the grasshopper pest.
This is the first indication that the army
of hoppers has moved away from, the
foothill region of the Interior, .and is taken
by Professor Hilgard as significant of the
fact that the plague which has heretofore
been confined to one or two districts will
probably become general throughout the
agricultural districts of the State.
Professor Hilgard takes a serious view
of the spread of the pest. He said:

congestion of population in the cities may be
relieved and easy access to farms be accom

of uniting for the more equitable distribution
of the* products of factory and field, all for
the upbuilding of the State.
St-cond â A- constitutional amendment abro

While it caused some delay, the report
as read by the chairman ot the commit
tee, D. T. Fowler, was eventually adop
ted as a whole and was as follows:
In fact there would not have been any
unpleasantness if J. G. Smith of Alameda
County had not tried to wedge in a sub
stitute for the first section of the report
of the Committee on Platform and Reso
lutions.
The evening session showed less inclina
tion to wrangle and more to get through
with the business before it.
WRANGLING DIMINISHES.
A motion to strike from the roll the
name of any person- who was pledged to
the Socialist. Democratic or Republican
parties was carried by a vote of 29 to 9.
The report. of the committee on creden
tials was adopted and the chair was em
powered to fill the vacancies on the com
mittee on platform and resolutions. An
amendment was carried that the commit
tee should consist of seven members . in
stead of twelve, which were chosen as
follows: George "W. Monteith, F. B.
Brown, W. H. Gllstrefp, W. G. Murphy,
D. T. Fowler, W. H. Buckley and J. K.

A motion was made and carried that a
new committee on credentials, composed
of W. J. Gilstrap, M. P. Squire and J. L.
Riddell, be appointed.
It was then seen clearly that the social
ists were attempting to block proceedings
and swallow the convention, and after
three hours of heated debate, with innu
merable ' interruptions, a motion was at
last carried to accept the report of the
committee on credentials and then dis
charge the committee.
SOCIALISTS INTERRUPT.
So far everything had moved smoothly,
but trouble came. The committee on plat
form and resolutions elected by the com
mittee on credentials could not come to
any agreement and stood 6 to 6.
The State Convention of the Allied Peo
ple's party was called to order yesterday
at 10:50 a. m. in Memorial Hall, Odd Fel
lows' building, by George W. Monteith,
chairman of the State Executive Com
mittee.
Mr. Monteith welcomed the delegates
and on behalf of the committee presented
the name, of Dr. C. H. Castle as tempo
rary . chairman. Dr. Castle was elected,
and G. W. Smith was elected temporary
secretary.
A committee on credentials was then
chosen, which in its turn elected a com
mittee on platform and resolutions, com
posed of twelve members.
During the morning the committee on
permanent organization was chosen, as
follows: C. J. Gardner, Nathan E. Flint,
M. P. Squire, John Hines and Charles E.
Lloyd. The morning session adjourned at
12 o'clock and the committee on platform
and resolutions went into session.
The afternoon, session opened with the
adoption of the report of the committee
on permanent organization. This com
mittee recommended that the name of the

The temporary officers were made perma
nent and J." K. Phillips was elected treas
urer by acclamation and F. J. Gregory
sergeant at arms.
The directors of the Xorth Shore Rail
road, formerly the JCorth Pacific Coast
Railway, made the announcement yester
day that 5750,000 wcrth of the 5 per cent
forty-year gold bonds had been sold. The
bonds were sold through the Mercantile
Trust Company of this city at par. ;
The directors now intend to commence
vork on the improvements they an
nounced they had in view. A new and
commodious ferry-boat â¢will be built and
placed in commission. The tracks to iJill
Valley and San Rafael, from SausalHo.
will be made standard gauge and 70-pound
rails used. These two roads will be
changed into electric systems, the rolling
stock having been already ordered.
The rotd from San Anselmo to Caza
dcro will also be overhauled and balanced
â¢with gravel, and heavier rails laid. The
officials of the company feel assured that
the improvements they are about to make
will do much to increase the population of
Marin County.
"I have wired to Sacramento asking tor
more definite information as to the situa
tion In Placer and EH Dorado counties,
â¢where It is said grasshoppers have become
a pest. Until I am informed as to the ex
act situation, I cannot say what steps will
be taken in regard to the request to use
the authority vested in me to order the
burning of pasture lands in thosd coun
ties. I shall probably be advised to-mor
row, when whatever action' is necessary
will be taken."
LOS ANGELES, June 17.â Governor
Gage said to-night in regard to a tele
gram sent to him by Chairman Dillman of
the Sacramento Board of Supervisors, con
veying the opinion of Attorney General
Ford on the subject of burning pasture
lands in El Dorado and Placer counties:
Referring to the Becond branch of your in
quiry, I beg to say that the State Board ot
Horticulture, beinc a creature of the statute, is
clothed with no sovereign powers, but is limited
to the powers specifically conferred upon it by
statute or those necessarily implied from the
statutory powers thus specifically jcranted.
I find no statutory authority which would
warrant your board in taking any of the sug
gested steps to arrest the threatened calamity
?tÂ» which ytfu refer, such as the burning ot
p&Eture lands and the like, nor do I rind the
statute of this State conferring: uoon any
officer, Mjeciflcally, the cower* herein dis
cussed. It follows, therefore, that this power
of the State can alone be exercised by its
Chief Executive, in whom, under the provis
ions of our State constitution, is vested the
supreme executive power of the State.
Of course the facts must warrant the exer
cise of this unusual and extraordinary power
of the State. According to the authorities, the
necessity therefor must be "^extreme, impera
tive and overwhelming." Whether the facts
to which you refer would warrant the exercise
of the power above iioted is a question upon
which I can. of course, express no opinion. This
question being one of fact must be determined
by those who represent the State in the exer
cise o* the above-described uower. If the
threatened calamity to which you refer is im
minent, grave and farreaching in its results;
it it affect a considerable section ot the State,
involving several counties therein; if the burn
ing over of certain pasture lands will prevent
the threatened calamity; and if by no other
means the threatened calamity can be averted,
then in my judgment, a condition has arisen
which would warrant the State in making use
or' the inherent and sovereign power abors
noted.
In reply to your first inquiry I beg to say
that the State of California in its sovereign
capacity is clothed with inherent power to pro
tect and preserve its own existence and to do
al! things needful to prevent or avert ji threat
ened calamity involving widespread destruction
of persons or property. This power is based in
part upon the old and well-known principle
that private right is and always must be sub
servient to the public good. In exercising the
power thus inherently belonging to the sov
ereign, the State of California may, where It
becomes necessary, take,- use or destroy the
private property of individuals' to prevent the
impending calamity, as, tor instance, to stop
the spreading of fire, to stay the ravages of
a pestilence, to arrest tjie advance of a hostile
army or to prevent any other great public
calamity. This power of the State to. act in
cases of great public necessity does not require
statutory authority, but comes directly from
the natural law, from the right of self-preser
vation.
Attorney General Ford, In reply to the
questions of J. J. Keegan, secretary of
the State Board of Horticulture, as to the
power of the State to protect orchards
from destruction by grasshoppers and
the authority which might be exercised
by the State Board of Horticulture in
connection with this matter, rendered tn-?
following opinion yesterday: Â¦

KEMP'S SUPPOSITORIES.
Avoid operations!
The very suggestion
Is terrifying. Only
a woman who suf-
fers with the disor-
ders peculiar to her
sex and Is advised
to undergo such a
dreadful ordeal can
understand, the fear
associated with it.
In order to effect
a cure the -cause
must first be re-
moved. When in-
flammation, conges-
tion, etc., exist, naturally the organs are In an
enlarged, swollen condition, and the increased
weight drags them down. Common-sense
should teach any one that all the instruments
In the world cannot heal or reduce soreness and
weakness, but only aggravate the trouble.
When Inflammation has assumed a chronic
form the organs can never relax to a normal
condition until the cause Is removed. There-
fore, nothing but a mild remedy Is required to
heal the sensitive parts. Kemp's Suppositories
never fall In all euch cases. They repair ths
wasted tissues and strengthen the organs gen-
erally, and until this Is effected no woman
can hope to be well. Kemp's Suppositories
contain no opiates to stupefy or benumb the
delicate parts, but by removing disordered con-
ditions naturally build up the entire system.
They are a sure . cure for leucorrhea and all
female complaints.
Kemp's Suppositories are put up only by the

other objects and purposes may be involved in
educational efforts among us, one of Its con
stant and prominent aims should be the culti

American citizenship. When we recall the fact
that the beneficence of our scheme of govern

units of our citizenship, it is at once apparent
that an important and common duty rests upon
every agency that undertakes tha instruction

HANDSOME TODNG WOMAN
WHO MARRIED 'A CITIZEN
OF SCOTLAND.
Bribing voters by the loan of oxen is a new form
of corrujition, and has the merit of being economical.
It will be seen that even when on victory bent the
Vermont politician retains a thrifty mind. -
Charges r and counter charges of bribery at the
primaries fill the Vermont air. Among the affi
davits published on the subject is one that runs thus:
"I, S. Deno,. 73 years of age, a legal voter in the town
of Shoreham, county of Addison, State of Vermont,
duly 'Jo depose* an^Ssay pn oath that I was offered the
use of a pair of oxen for two months by M. Mack,
one of J. G. McCyllough's managers, to cast my ballot
at the Republican caucus held at Shoreham, jVt., on
May 31, 1902, for the McCullough candidates to the
State convention to be held at Montpelier, Vt., on
June IV, 1902." â¢ ; . â¢ .
Whatever may be the cause of the trouble there is
no denying the existence of the trouble itself. At the
primaries the neutral candidate is said to have ob
tained the election of 312 delegates to the State con
vention, the prohibitionists 169 and the local option
man 222. There are twenty-five other votes, not
pledged, and the convention, which assembles on
Thursday, is expected to be red-hot and full of
ginger.
There are- various theories. concerning the cause of
the outbreak. Three rich men are candidates for the
Republican nomination for Governor, and some say
their money has done the talking that has caused all
the excitement. One faction stands for prohibition,
another for high license and local option, while the
third is neutral; so some folks say whisky is at the
bottom of the row. Finally, one candidate represents
the Central Vermont -Railway, another the Rutland
Railway, while the third represents no railway; and
accordingly the inference is drawn that the ruction is
nothing more nor less than a large and general rail
way collision.
FOR many a year past politics in Vermont has
been safe, quiet and one-sided. So much of a
foregone conclusion has each successive election
been that flippant people in other States have spoken
of a r Republican nomination in Vermont as a sure
thing, a pudding, a snap and a cinch. This year the
unexpected has happened.' The long dormant volca
noes of political, strife have broken out in a Pelee
eruption. There is more politics to the acre in Ver
mont this year ; than in New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, or even, Indiana. So great has been the up
roar that all JJew England has become excited, and
even in Washington political experts are neglecting
the affairs of the nation to talk of Vermont.
Beginning the new era in their history with such
a spirit, the Boers are almost certain to achieve in
the end the high purpose at which they aimed. Men
who can meet dangers so bravely and bear disaster
with such fortitude may be .overcome by resistless
numbers, but they can never be completely" con^
quered. Meeting their former foes without malice
the Boers will face the new conditions .of their
country and prove themselves the dominant element
of its population/so that in the end the federation of
South Africa will be essentially a -Boer republic
animated by the'Boer spirit.
Were Dewet the only eminent leader of the burgh
ers who lias spoken in that way the utterance might
be supposed to be the expression of feelings peculiar
to himself. However, he is not the only one. All
other notable representative men of Boers have said
substantially, the same thing. For example, General
Botha and Acting President Schalkburger of the
Transvaal in an address to their people after the sur
render said: ."Now, that there is peace, and although
it is not a peace such as we longed for, yet let us
abide where God has led us. We can, with a clear
conscience, declare that for two and a half years pur
people have carried on the struggle in a mariner al
most unknown to history. Let us now grasp each
other's hands, for another great struggle lies before
us _ a struggle for the spiritual and racial prosperity
and welfare of our people. Casting aside all feelings
of bitterness, let us learn to forget and to forgive, so
that the deep wounds caused by this war may be
healed "
Speaking- to the Boers in the prison camp at Win
burg General Dewet, after acivising them to be loyal
to the Britith Government, said: "Perhaps it is hard
for you to hear this from- my mouth, but God has
decided thus. I fought until there was no more hope
cf upholding our cause, and, however it may be, the
lime has now come to lay down our arms. As a
Christian, God now demands that we be faithful to
our new Government. Let us submit to his deci
sion.",, . .
There- is no inconsistency between the vigorous
prosecution of what threatened to become a war of
extermination and the frank acceptance of peace. In
each case the spirit is the same â that of an intense
religious fervor, a firm fixed belief that the destiny
of mortals is decreed by the 4 will of God; that when
a man has done his best, heroically, but failed, it
then becomes his duty to submit with fortitude to the
ways of Providence.
:WeVe this spirit of loyalty accompanied by a feel
ing of hatred for the victor and a desire for revenge
the association would seem natural. In fact, when
the war was raging it was believed that a people so
stern as the Boers would never be reconciled to
British rule even were it established over their coun
try by irresistible force. No such feeling, however,
has been manifest since the terms of I peace were
agreed upon. On the contrary, there has been a
remarkable display of good will on both sides.
Kitchener's speeches to the Boers have been suffi
ciently noble and generous in sentiment to be termed
magnanimous, while those of the Boer leaders have
shown in ihe acceptance of defeat a spirit as lofty as
that which prompted them in their hours of bright
est hope.
GENERAL DEWET visited the prison camp
at Winburg last Friday and was received by
the Boers with an extraordinary manifesta
tion of loyalty and affection. The men cheered him
and the women and children were moved to tears
in their efforts to express their love for their hero.
Kitchener, the victor of the war, will never receive
such a welcome as was accorded by the conquered
burghers to their defeated hero. It was another
manifestation of the indomitable courage of the
Boer people. In defeat as in victory they remain true
to their leaders and their cause.

industry so uncertain as to injure them and hinder
tween this country and the islands.
Among the many valid objections to that annexa
' tion was the condition there that makes Asiatic coolie
fcbor absolutely necessary to the profit of the planta
tions and the prosperity of the islands. This objec
tion was frequently and" forcibly made by The Call,
End its correctness has been cbnfessed by the an
nexation party on the islands, who plead for a dif
ferential policy as to coolie labor that will exclude
it from the continent but permit it in the archipelago.
Cuba has a large laboring population of tropical ne
groes and has less need for Asiatic coolies. Long
before the annexation of Hawaii we controlled more
than 90 per cent of her trade, so that no commercial
perturbation could possibly follow the political ab
sorption of that country. , "
As the President is retrospective others may in
dulge in that method of argument When the Ding
ley tariff passed the sugar rate was framed to protect
American cane and beet sugar. Dingley, Dalzell and
Payne so declared, and put that feature before the
farmers of the country as the highest merit of the
measure affecting the interests of agriculture. Ding.
ley is dead, but Payne and Dalzell are living and still
in their' seats in the House. What they said to cheer
the farmers on for the Dingley tariff has been
quoted to them during the debate on Cuban free
trade, and they sat silent.
Suppose now, to be retrospective again, that when
we responded to the cry of Cuba in 1898 she had
asked that we not only give ler freedom at our ex
pense but that we also give lfcr free trade, does any
one believe that we would have responded to the
mercenary request? Her appeal was sentimental en
tirely, and in those days, when we sympathized with
her aspiration for freedom to the extent of violating
the neutrality .laws and our treaties with Spain to aid
4 her -in rebellion long before our formal declaration
of war, no sordid motive mingled with her appeal for
help. If such motive had been suggested, would our
response have met with .such general approval? Let
the President answer that question.
Retrospection 'confirms the declaration that not a
shot would have been fired in behalf of Cuba'had the
commercial motive been whispered. This being true,
the attack upon protection is an afterthought en
tirety. It has influenced our Cuban policy since the
liberation only, and not before. In our view it
threatens the whole policy of protection. If it be true
that we need the thirty millions of Cuban trade, it is
I still truer that we need the many hundred millions of
trade of the British Isles, and if we adopt free trade
to get the small trade of Cuba, what answer can the
President make if free trade is said to be necessary
to hold our commerce with Great Britain?
If protection is a policy of expediency and not of
principle it is far better to abolish it entirely, because
when treated as expediency it makes investment and
ignorance of the trade relations long established be-
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has entered into
the cause of Cuban free trade with his usual
zeal, earnestness and frankness. Congress and
the country have the felicity of knowing just where
he stands. In his special message on that subject he
indulges in one faulty retrospection, to which atten
tion may be called. He draws an analogy between
Cuban free trade and the opposition thereto and the
objections that were made to the annexation of
Hawaii. In that connection he says: "Some of our
citizens oppose the lowering of the tariff on Cuban
products just as three years ago they opposed the
admission of the Hawaiian Islands lest free trade
with them might ruin certain of our interests here.
In the actual event their fears proved baseless as re
gards Hawaii, and their apprehensions as to the
carnage to any industry of our own because of the
proposed measure of reciprocity with Cuba seem to
be equally baseless.*'
While it is true that such an objection to the an
nexation of Hawaii may have been made in some
quarters, it weighed so little in the general mass of
opposition that but few can recall it. As a matter of
fact Hawaii, for more than twenty years, had free
trade with this country in all her staple products and
free exchange with sll our staples necessary to the
life of her people. So, if such objection as * the
President recalls were made, it originated in entire
CUBA AND HAWAII.
It will be noted that the Prison Directors have set a day for beginning an investi
gation of the same matters that are involved in the Governor's suit for betterment of
his reputation. They will need the same witnesses; the same books, accounts and records
and may need them at the same time that they are under subpena at San Pedro. Does
the Governor desire to prevent investigation by the Prison Directors? It is quite cer
tain that a judicial inquiry, going' on at San Pedro and an administrative investigation
going on at the same time at San Quentin will not serve the ends of justice, nor tend to
develop the facts. It may be that responsibility for a proper trial and an. unembarrassed
inquiry will be thrown upon the defendants, and, if so," they will not hesitate to assume
it, for they have no wish to lie down upon the taxpayers, as the Governor has done, nor
to delay nor hinder the consideration of the mass of evidence in the case. , '
A man who is in the pangs of longing for vindication, who is hectic with a
febrile desire to appear whiter than snow before the State Convention occurs, should
have sought more convenient means and a handier locality in which to give his reputauon
a bath. We believe there is a Justice of the Peace at Indio, in the Colorado Desert, below
the level of the sea. Why did not the Governor go to Indio? What does he fear in San
Francisco, Sacramento or even in Los Angeles? If he is all right, and can disprove all
pleas of justification made by the defendants, his disproof is just as good in sight of San
Quentin and the scene of the charges as out of sight, in far away San. Pedro. If he desire
speedy justice why go so far for a forum that justice will get footsore plodding to the trial?
â¢ The Governor is evidently determined to restore the gaudy glow of his good
name, regardless of the cost to the people. Just why he chose San Pedro is not dis
closed. That quiet marine town has not heretofore established a reputation as a libel
trial resort. It had a somewhat stormy birth as a seaport, and was favored by Congress
because of its obvious advantages as the port of Los Angeles, and - there seems to
be nothing in its past, present or future to recommend it aÂ» a sanitarium for damaged
reputations, or a receiving hospital for good names that have been sprained in other
parts of the State. In fact its sole adaptability to the Governor's uses seem to be its ex
treme distance from the scene of the accident which he, complains has befallen
his character. /
It is nearly five hundred miles from San Quentin to San Pedro. In a proceeding
for criminal libel the people have to pay the expenses of the actual plaintiff, who in this
case is the Governor of California. An officer has to come with the warrant, handcuffs' and
mileage, to drag the trembling prisoners far from home and friends', and is entitled to col
lect, for himself and them, railroad fare and .seventy-five cents a meal, eh route. The
books and accounts of the prison, records in the Controller's office, if they have got
back from' the Governor's private inquiry, and the witnesses, including officers of the
prison and prisoners in, their charge, all must be taken to San Pedro and returned in
good repair, at the public expense.

A grand v night parade will probably be
the feature v of the coming Fourth of July
celebration. Market, Kearny and Mont
gomery streets will be lighted as they
were during the recent, visit of the
Shriners, and many of the principal build
ings that were illuminated on that occa
sion will add to the attraction of the pa
geant by their electric adornments.
At a meeting of the committee held
yesterday afternoon at the California
Hotel the matter of holding a parade was
discussed, and met- with general fa
vor. ,. The only obstacle in the way,
however, is the word of Colonel J. B.
Rawles that the troops from the Presidio
cannot parade at night. >A* large number
of merchants have expressed a determi
antionto place handsome floats in the
line of march, and with the National
Guard and civic organizations the absence
of the soldiers may not' be greatly noted.
Fireworks will be exploded along the line
of march, and the entire affair promises
to be one of the most brilliant of its kind
ever held in the city. - Â¦ ,. .
Owing to the additional cost of lighting
Market, Kearny and Montgomery streets
on the night of the Fourth of July it was
decided to solicit subscriptions to the
amount of $000, so that the allotment for
fireworks will not have to be curtailed;
An effort will be made to have a man-of
war artistically illuminated in the harbor.
A petition will be presented to the Gov
ernor of the State asking him to declare
Saturday, July 5, a legal holiday, and the
various religious denominations will . be
requested to embody patriotic exercises in
their programmes on Sunday. July 6. The
proposed regatta. on the afternoon of the
Fourth was abandoned. Exercises will
be held at Metropolitan Temple. Attor

BALLOT FOR SENATOR |
Â£Y UNIONISTS
Making Preparations to
Celebrate the Fourth
of July. ,
Total .$12,000,000
Dodge says that these reductions will
only be offset by newly discovered per
sonal property. Increases in value/ of
downtown realty and by new buildings.
He says that it would take a force of ten
clerks to determine at this time the total
amount of assessed valuation.
She Will Have the Man
agement of Vast
Estate.
Mrs. Sarah Sloss, widow of Louis Sloss,
the California pioneer, who died at San
Rafael on the 4th inst., will inherit her
late husband's vast estate. In his will,
which will be filed within a few days, the
deceased directs that all his possessions
shall go to his devoted wife. He makes
this disposition of his property, he states
in the document, because he feels con
fident that before she is called to her last
rest she will make a just and equitable di
vision of the property among their five
children, Leon, Louis Jr., Superior Judge
M. C. a.nd Joseph Sloss and Mrs. E. R.
Lilienthal. V ,
Sloss also leaves a number of bequests
to charitable organizations. The Pacific
Hebrew Orphan Asylum will receive $10,

The local aerie has been making exten
sive preparations for its trip to Napa to
attend the grand celebration to be given
by the Eagles of that place on July 4. It
has chartered a steamboat to convey its
members to the festivities and they in
tend to drop in on their country brothers
in bright uniforms and regalia.
It is to help pay the expenses of the trip
that the minstrel entertainment has been
arranged.
Assessor Dodge Informs Mayor
Schmitz of Large Reduction in
Various Properties.
In rgply to a request of Mayor
Schmitz as to what the assessment roll
would amount to this year Assessor
Dodge stated yesterday, that he had rea
s6n to believe that it will exceed the fig
ures of last year, when it was $405,000,000.
In that event the appropriations for
street and sewer improvements made by
the Supervisors contingent on an assessed
roll of $420,000,000 will "go a-glimmering."
Dodge informs the Mayor that the fol
lowing reductions will be made under last
year's roll:
By distribution of blgr estates... $3,000,000
By reduced value of bank stock con
sequent on Investment in govern
ment bonds 3,000,000

Dies From His Wound.
v Emmet de Suza, who was shot by hia
stepfather, Joseph Guadalupe, at 1329
Fourteenth avenue, Sunday, died at the
City and County Hospital early yesterday
morning- and his body was removed to
the Morgue. Guadalupe is still detained
in the City Prison, but no charge will be
placed against him pending the result of
the Coroner's inquest.
Sues Rival for Damages.
Louis Epstein, who keeps a second-hand
store on Mission street, filed a suit yester
day to recover $5000 damages from Henry
Sparber, a business rival. He charges
Sparber with assaulting him last Satur
day. He further alleges that during the
scuffle that ensued 3155 in coin was lost
from his pocket.
Another significant change, indicating
the blowing of the wind, is the engage
ment of Professor H. Morse Stephens of
Cornell University as professor of the de
partment of modern history- He has been
put- over the head of Professor Thomas
Bacon, and has also been given charge of
the university extension work. Bacon
has been at Berkeley for some years
Instructor Archie Pierce of the depart
ment of mathematics is also said to be
s.&ted for removal. He was given a
year's leave of absence in 1901, and it -Is
said he will not return. -
President Wheeler is now in the south
ern part of the State, but he will return
to attend the meeting of the regents in
July. There are many of the instructors
who would like to have a look at the list
of the faculty that President Wheeler
will prepare for submission to the regents
Gossip also says that Professor Albin
O. Putzker *>f the German department is
slated for removal. PuUker was reduced
last year from the head of the department
and was given charge of the instruction
of German literature. His salary was
also reduced. Professor Schilling was
brought from Yale College to replace
Putzger.
Professor L. Du Pont Syle. associate
professor of English, is also likely to be
dispensed with. Syle is now in Europe
and will return next month. He was
raised from the rank of an assistant pro
fessor to that of associate professor twa
years ago, despite the opposition of Pro
fessor Gayley, the head of the depart
ment. Rumor now says that Gayley has
won the ear of the "powers that be'-' and
that Syle will be ousted.
Rumor has it that Professor Christy,
the head of the mining department, will
be replaced by an Eastern man. Profes
sor Fred Slate of the department Of
physics is said to be another name on the
"decapitation list."
Captain Emil Kellner, for many years
superintendent of the university grounds,
has been replaced by Walter Bolton, 23
years of age. Kellner has been reduced
to the rank of .head gardener of the de
partment of agriculture, while his suc
cessor is said to have come to Berkeley
"direct from a ranch in Arizona."
A similar state of things exists in the
case of John A. Reid, an instructor in
the department of geology. He will not
apply lor reappointment at the next me'et
ing of the regents.
Lorin Hunt, an instructor of the depart
ment of civil engineering, and Walter
Chandler, who held a similar post, have
asked President Wheeler not to present
their names to the regents for reappoint
ment. Both gentlemen have secured other
positions, and rumor says that they were
"informed officially" that they stood no
chance of re-election.
Instructor Shinn, inspector of agricul
tural stations, resigned last month. He
stated, however, that his resignation was
forced, and considerable feeling was en
gendered. , - .. , .
For some time past rumors have filled
the 'air that President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler proposes to replace many of the
instructors with Eastern men and that
his views are fully indorsed by the re
gents.
There are some people* living in the uni
versity town who say' that President
Wheeler controls the regents, and that
when a well known attorney was recently
appointed to the board he asked a fellow
member for some information as to pro
cedure and he was told, "Wait until Pres
ident Wheeler nods and then vote 'yes'."
A number of changes in the faculty* at
Berkeley University made recently give
color tos the rumors of wholesale decapita
tion of instructors.
The July meeting of the Board of Re
gents of the State University is awaited
with a feeling of consternation by many
of .the professors and instructors of the
Berkeley seat of learning.
"I gave no orders whatever for the land
ing of the doctor, and never give orders
for the landing of Chinamen," added St.
John. "I simply execute the orders of the
Collector. Customs Inspector Banks was
at the gang plank, and he declares that he
allowed no Chinese persons to pass. Dr.
Yung Wing might easily be mistaken for
a South American, as there was nothing
about him to suggest that he was a Chi
naman and I suppose he walked oft the
steamer without being challenged. The
steamship company is responsible for the
safe keeping of Chinese immigrants on
board and I have nothing to do with
them. Dr. Wing went to the Occidental
Hotel on the same day and was inter
viewed by hotel reporters for the daily
papers and they puolished articles about
him. If the Chinese Bureau wanted him
they could have got him at the hotel. He
left on Sunday morning on his way to Log
Angeles, en route to his home. All the
papers had a. notice of his arrival and I
am astonished that the bureau didn't get
him at the hotel. Just to show you the
way they do business they charged me
with letting the woman Ah Kee escape,
when she was on the steamer all the time
and never left it."
The special agents are investigating the
matter.
The Gaelic arrived last Friday and
among her cabin passengers was Dr.
Wing, a graduate of Yale, a naturalized
American citizen and a resident of New
Haven, Connecticut. On Saturday St.
John was on board the steamer and met
the doctor, whom he found to ' be a ven
erable gentleman of 74 years of age,
dressed in American clothing, wearing a
gray mustache curled up at the ends and
speaking the purest English. The doctor
showed the official his naturalization par
pers and St. John said: "I guess you're
all right on those papers." Then he
turned away to attend to his official du
ties.
There is war between . Deputy Customs
Surveyor' St. John and the Chinese Bu
reau. The bureau charged him with ine
responsibility for the escape of Dr.* Yung
Wing from the Gaelic last Friday and of
Ah Kee. the female nurse in the family
of E. WJ Tilden, agent of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company at Kobe, Japan. St.
John proved that the woman never left
the vessel and that she is still there, and
the charge was narrowed down to the es
cape of the Chinese doctor. â¢ v

CHICAGO, June 17.â Corn went on the ram
page to-day, and, headed by 'the bull crowd
that has cornered July options,' led the un
fortunate ' shorts a- rapid and exciting chase.
Early in the day the word went around that
the screws were, to .be put on the shorts long
before the settling day. -The pit was in a con
stant' boil from start to finish. It was a
day for. covering and practically everything
else was lost eight of. Thete is little doubt
that the principals back of the corner in July,
which is credited to the Gates and Wall street
crowd, are trying to move out all contract
stuff. The 'country probably could furnish
plenty of stuff with which, to supply the shorts,
but the wet weather has worked against grad
ing. Of to-day's receipts only ten out of 378
cars graded No. 2. Primary receipts were in
creased to 477.000 bushels and private elevators
were making good increases in stock. But all
told there was cause for fear among the shorts,
for, it is thought by old speculators that the
long expected squeeze Is at hand, otherwise
the bulls would not allow the price to run,
away * as it - did to-day. 1 Contract stocks to
day were ' a little over two million bushels.
The bull crowd is credited with .having
15,000,000 bushels of July. Predictions are for
75c corn as a result of . this situation, and
fluctuations to-day warranted such predictions.
July opened unchanged to ] /&c up at 64 v %@O4'5&c,
after having sold yesterday as low -as 63c. A
sharp ten minutes' buying sent the price to
t50%c. The bulls supplied enough long stuff
on profit-taking to let the price slip back to
65%c, but then the shorts became panic
stricken, the market turned erratic and July
shot to 07%c, where it closed very strong,
:j^c higher than yesterday'e close. The Gates
crowd was on both sides of the market, but
sold more than It bought. Deferred futures were
traded in lightly, but influenced somewhat by
the advance in July. Cash- business was not
as good as recently, and country offerings were
small. Cash stuff was selling 5@8c under July
orlces.
Wheat ruled steady. It was strongest early
on higher Paris cables and showers Southwest.
Traders said the wet weather was interfering
with harvesting and for this reason would sÂ«ll
little. The absence of any Â¦ heavy trading
worked against prices and although July corn
strength helped wheat somewhat, fluctuations
were very narow. July opened unchanged to
>/sC up at 72@72>6c and sold to 72? g c.
Light selling caused a dip to 71%@72c an.l
luly closed steady, a shade lower, at 72@72V&c.
Oats were dull and steady, fluctuating within
a range of only ?Â»c. July closed a shade lower,
at 39%c.
Provision trade was almost nil. July pork
closed 7%c down, lard 5c "down and ribs 2%c
lower. Â¦

WHEAT â The markets all over the world
continue featureless and Inactive. Futures at
Paris were higher. The status of the world"s
stocks, as gi\en by Bradstreet's, was as fol
lows : East of the Rockies, a decrease of
2,961,000 bushels: Europe and' afloat, a de
crease of 1.500,000; total decrease, 4,461.000
bushels. A cable from France reported the
weather wet and the season backward.
There was not much life at Chicago, except
a crowing nervousness among the ehorts over
no rains in the Southwest.
This market was quiet and not materially
changed. Features opened higher, but fell
back. Shipping descriptions were unchanged.

OATS â The demoralization of the past three
or four days was succeeded yesterday by rather
more steadiness, and while. there was no more
disposition to buy, there was less to slaughter
the coods. Quotations stood about the same,
though new red was held with more firmness,
holders being of the opinion that choice ought
to bring at least $1 25. Common lots, how
ever, were obtainable down to $1 15. Some
inquiry for export was reported, and It was
probably this prospective business that stead
led the market. Quotations for old continued
nominal.

CORN â There was a sudden flurry at Chi
cago yesterday. A dispatch from Fort Worth.
Texas, said that the drought over Northern and
Central Texas was becoming alarming, the
crops burning up on account of hot winds, and
that unless there were rains in a few day8
the corn crop would be a total failure. This
sudden and unexpected dry weather scare sent
the shorts skurrying for cover, and advanced
the market from 64%c to 6f9gc.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter continues , weak, and sellers are giv
ing concessions to effect sales. Stocks are too
large for the light local demand to absorb.
Cheese remains as previously quoted. Sup
plies are not excessive, but the market baa
about all it can carry. - - ,
Eggs are undeniably weak, and dealers are
offerings them on all sides at concessions from
previous prices. Good ranch Eggs can now
bo bought for ISc, and 20c is the top asked
by anybody. Supplies are very large and ac
cumulating. Store Eggs are especially weak,,
and are' not in favor with buyers at the mo
ment, as the hot weather in the Interior is
beginning to affect their quality. Receipts are
increasing again, as will be seen. -
Receipts were 58,600 pounds, 18S cubes and

The J Feather and Crops.
The .weekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
director of the climate and. crop service ol the
Weather Bureau, is as Follows :
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Warm weather has prevailed in the central
and northern ecctions. but in Southern Cal
ifornia the -weather has been unusually cool,
Â¦with heavy foss. and thunderstorms accom
panied by rain and hail occurred at the be
ginning of the week.
Grasshoppers in large numbers are reported
la portions of the San Joaquin and Sacramento'
Talleyt, where considerable damage has been
done to crops. Farmers are burning pasture
lands and spraying orchards and vines in an
â¢ffort to destroy the pest. In some places it
la claimed that grain is tco far advanced to be
â¢eriously injured by the grasshoppers. Grain
harvest is progressing nicely in the great val
leys. Barley is yielding very well, and the
au&llty * 6 excellent. Very little wheat has been
harvested, but the crop is maturing rapidly.
The hay crop !e nearly all gathered, and the
yield and quality are reported above average.
Kops in Sonoma County are very thrifty, and
the yield will probably be the largest ever
gathered. Sugar beets, beans, corn q.nd vege
tables are making good growth. Pasturage is
abundant except in the south. Irrigating water
Is becoming scare in Southern California.
Deciduous fruits have matured rapidly dur
ing the week, and all varieties will soon be In
market. With the exception of prune? and
pears, excellent crops are espeetetl in nearly
a:! sections, and prunes will yieid an average
crop in seme places. Grapes are in esxellent
condition and a heavy yield is predicted. Some
vineyards have been damaged by grasshoppers.
Valr.uts and citrus fruite are dDins welL
SACRAMENTO VALLEYâ Weather condi
tions have been nearly normal during the week,
and crops have advanced steadily. Grain is
lEaturing lapidly: harvest :s progressing in
Â¦ome sections, and the yield is reported heavy.
Gra&ehcjjpers have caused but little damage
thus far. s~i it \% stated that most of the
rrain i* too far advanced to be seriously' in
jured. Farmers are htrhting the pett by burn
iv.p pasture lands and spraying trees and vines.
The Lay crop is unuFually heavy and the qual
ity <?xÂ«-i!tr.U Deciduous fruits continue in good
condition, and are ripening rapidly. Vineyards
are thrifty, and sive Indications of a large
crop. It is r*T>orted that several acres of
Brar*vines in Sacramento County have been
ruined by grasshoppers. Citrus fruits are doing
Â¦welL
COAST AND RAT SECTIONS.â Continued
Tvarm weather during the week has been favor
aMo for all crops. Grain and fruit have de
veloped rapidly, and hops, beets, corn and
wtsctalfles have made good growth. Early eoirn
sxain is ready for harvest in some of the
nnrthern districts, and prospects are good for a
iMatf crop. The hay crop is above average in
y'old ar.3 quality in tie central and northern
flistrictF, and fair in the south. It is â¬sti
rr.ated that the yield of hops in Sonoma Coun
ty will be tbe heaviest ever harvested- There
Â«rp no reports of thÂ« grasshopper pest in the
coast and bay countiet Deciduous fruits are
in excellent condition, and more than average
crops cf most varieties are expected. Cher
ries and otipr small fruits, are being gathered
ae rapicly as poeJtil*. and the canneries are
tn full cperaticn. Farmers, orchardiets and
earners in Alameda County are unable to se
cure sufficient labor to properly handle th;
heavy crops. CHrus fruits are thrifty.

NEW TORK. June 15.â Yesterday'* volume
of activity in stocks was about maintained
to-day and the degree of diversity of the trade
Â¦was very similar. The movement of prices -was
rather irregular. In spite of. the striking sains
by somÂ» of the stocks which led the market In
point of activity. A movement to take profits
in St. raul added to the irregular appearanoe
of the market, as the grain carrying railroads
generally sb<nred some conspicuous points of
strength. The upward movement in the Read
ings was also pronounced and the dealings in
that stock were on a very large scale, even
after ailo-wing for iu enumeration as half
shares. The forces back of these movements
were concentrated and their operations were
net conspicuous outside of a few stocks. It
was not clear that the large buying move
ments in all cases were from identical sources
but It was evident that the operations were in
concert. The brokers who were buying Rradtns
were sellers of St. Paul, while the large ab
sorption of Missouri Pacific seemed to come
from ether sources, said to be a pool which has
operated in this stock for many months. Union
Pacify maintained Its recent stable tendency
and the .Atohisons were not so active as yes
terday. Soveral minor stocks among the
grangers wero active and strong, notably the
St. Joseph and Grand Island stocks, under the
combined Influence of the approach of the div
idend period and rumors of abrorption by Union
Pacific. Thpre was great irregularity among
the industrials, but the most important stocks
in that drpartment were heavy. There was ac
tive liquidation in Sugar, owing to unfavora
ble opinion of the chances of Cuban reciprocity
in the Senate. United Etatos Steel ntock3 wero
depressed by yesterday' * injunction measure
againi-t the stock conversion. General Electri
was *aslly forced down fl points on light sell
ing. Thrre was some demand on the other hand
for Presped Steel Car. American Car. Snuff,
Bicycle preferred and New York Dock, the last
named rising 6% points. There was no new?
to explain the movement* among tho loaders
beyond the progress of a speculative cam
pa, gn. The excitement In the corn market seem
ingly did not affect the corn carrying roads,
as H *Â£Â£? not as8 Â°c'ated with bad crop re
ports. The falling of ehowcrs In the cotton belt
was learned with satisfaction and the etrength
or wheat In foreign markets, which was re
flected here, was a favorable influence on the
price of securities. There was .no news of the
coal strike to account for the strength of the
Readings, although assertions were heard In
Wall street that the collapse of the strike
was probably at hand. There was no uneasi
ness apparent over the money market not
withstanding U:c approach of the time for
preparation of the semi-annual settlement and
the known requirements for several syndicate
operations. Including the payment of $8,OOoI<KW

drawing a revolver, took a shot at Ru
dolph, but missing him, struck him a vio
lent blow with the weapon, knocking him
down the stairs.

WHII.E OWNER IS AT FAIR
SEATTLE, June 17.â The servant girl
problem has at last been solved by some
of the citizens ot Ballard, a suburban
town, who have formed a co-operative
club, numbering eight families. Officers
have been elected and a commodious
building engaged, which will serve as
kitchen and dining-rooms. Competent
help will be hired, and, although all will
bear the expenses of the undertaking,
each family will have its own table in tho
dining-room and enjoy as much as possi
ble the privacy and comforts of a home.
Although this departure in the merger
business is only an experiment it bids fair
to become a success. One of the rules of
the club will be that no "knocker" will bo
tolerated. All complaints must bo made
to the president. It is expected that tho
scheme will be In running order by an
other week. '

AT ROTTINDEAN FOLK
LONDON, June 17.â The action of Rud
yard Kipling on June 2 in dispersing a
mob which threatened the house at Rot
tindean, Sussex, of his aunt, Lady
Burne-Jbnes, a pro-Boer and widow of
the late Sir Edward Burne-Jones, the
painter, because of her having dis
played a black banner inscribed, "You
have killed, you have conquered," has
caused a local sensation 'that shows no
signs of abating.- Â¦ x _ wl
When Kipling, who also lives at Rottln
dean, went to the rescue of his aunt and
in so doing shouldered his way through
the crowd, he delivered a thoroughly Kip
lingesque oration of the kind the people
of Rottlndean were not accustomed to
hear from one who had established the
local rifle brigade and had stirred up local
imperialism to the boiling Doint. To show
hi? further disapproval of the attack on
his aunt's house Kipling has now shut
up the drill hall which he had given to
the publlo. This Â¦ action has created in
tense feeling. Kipling. refuses to express
an opinion regarding the black banner,
but he emphatically announces his dis
approval of Rottindean's manner of ex
pressing its disapproval of it.

in the afternoon the couple returned for
the parental blessing. They expect to
have a repetition of the ceremony to-mor

The exhibits of the Elks themselves
show great ingenuity and humor. The
Elks police court, which was started last
night for the first time and will be con
tinued through the week, is full of fun.
Burlesque policemen are sent out through
the ground to arrest any Elks and certain
of the well-known men about town. These
arrested ones are taken before an Elks
police judge and fined for anything or
nothing, generally the latter. Last night
"Jedge" G. Wash. Reed sat, while to
night J. Rastus McElroy presided and
dealt out injustice to all. The Elkville po-
depend almost exclusively upon volunteer
assistance for their officials and were not
prepared to handle such crowds as have
patronized the /carnival. Chief of Police
Hodgkins has 'been on the grounds every
evening, while the actual handling of the
patrolmen has been in the control of
Night Police Captain Walter J. Petersen.
Clay Hawbaker says he is going to clear
enough money from the big Elks and
soda water to buy the "Elks' family" for
the new lodgreroom.
The Elks' Country Store has afforded as
much amusement as any feature on the
grounds. Some of the articles that are se
cured through the blind prize ticket sys
tem of purchase are extremely startling.

The San Francisco Turn Verein is mak
ing great preparations for participating
in the gymnastic and field contests com
ing off at the district tournament to be
held at San Jose, commencing Saturday,
June 21, and ending June 24. There will
be delegations from all the vereins on the
coart from Portland to San Diego, and
the contest for the first honors will be
exciting and interesting. The classes of
the local verein have been in active train
ingr under Professor H. Goetz for more
than two months.
The contests include apparatus work,
field sports, recitations, singing and
sharpshootlng. Two trains have been
chartered by the verein to carry its mem
bers and friends to the scene of the con
tests. One will leave Saturday evening
at 6:30 o'clock and the other on Sunday
ir.ornir.g at 8:30 o'clock. A rousing recep
tion awaits the participants at San Jose.
The affair is in charge of the following
committee: F. Otter, H. Roehr and H.
Hemtning of San Jose; J. Simmen, H.
Goetz, William Plagemann, C. Trost, F.
Zecher and William Bamgarten of San
Francisco: A- Curlin of Oakland, and J.

The crowds are uniformly good-natured.

GOOD-NATURED CROWDS.
Not a small number have been drawn
from San Francisco, while the neighbor
ing towns have contributed liberally to
ward the numbers who have Invaded Oak
land. This is regarded with favor by peo
ple who are interested in the material ad
vancement of Oakland, for it indicates an
awakening on the part of thJs city and an
ability to attract from the outside.
OAKLAND, June 17.â This was a
quiet, though none the less suc
cessful day at the Elks' Car
nival. There was no set pro
gramme except the music that
is furnished every afternoon and evening,,
and those who attended had time to wan
der about and visit the concessions, some
thing that the abnormal crowds of Satur
day and Monday made almost impossible.
The success of the carnival is assured and
has gone beyond even the wildest expec
tations of the Oakland Elks. The radical
members of the Elks thought that 50.000
people might visit the fair during the
seven days, while the conservative mem
bers thought that the number might be
as low as 25,000. The paid admissions on
Saturday numbered 16,000, while yesterday
they reached the enormous number of
21,874. Thus in two days the extreme
number of estimated admissigns for the
entire season has been almost reached.
It is now believed that the total number
of paid admissions during the week will
exceed 100,000.

Secretary M. J. White of the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children was granted letters of guardian
ship over Alice, Gertrude and William
Murray and Mabel Simmons yesterday.
The mother of the children was sent to
the County Jail for three months recently
for neglecting her little ones. They have
been at the Children's Hospital since her
arrest.

Hullen Up for Forg-ery.
Douglas S. Cone of Red Bluff was in
Ean Francisco yesterday. He announced
definitely that he was not a candidate for
nomination to the office of Railroad Com
missioner.
Bank Commissioner Bernard Murphy,
the leading light of the Monticello Club,
appears to be gaining favor in the Demo
cratic camp. In their own councils the
Democrats contend that Murphy could
easily defeat Gage. Dick Beamer is
spoken of as a chief among vote-getting
statesman of the Democratic party. When
the question of winning out against Pres
ton, Schmitz. Pardee, Flint or Edson is
presented, the Democrats make no pre
dictions of success. It is not at all like
ly that the Republican State Convention
will go to the leaders of the Democratic
party for advice in the make-up of the
ticket. The Republican voters desire the
nomination of a man whose leadership
will unite their own party and strengthen
their imn tiekctf-i. â¢"
The story that ex-Governor Budd is
Elated for Democratic leadership in the
gubernatorial campaign cannot be 6up
pressed by the repeated assertions of
Budd that under no circumstances will he
accept the nomination.
THE DEMOCRATIC CAMP.
The various candidates for legislative
honors are wisely beeping out of the
gubernatorial contest Before the San
Jose convention there was an inclination
on the part of push-sympathizing aspir
ants to get next to the Gage machine,
but since the crushing defeat of the boss
forces at a. point where Gage had put
forth his utmost endeavor to win, the
legislative aspirants have been steering
away from his Gageship. . The desire for
Gage's nomination comes mainly from the
Democratic camp. The Governor is now
actively bidding for the support of Demo
crats and points to the fact that he has
retained in office and reaupointed many
representatives of the Democratic party.
In the Twenty-second Senatorial Dis
trict, comprising the Thirty-ninth and
Fortieth Assembly districts, San Fran
cisco, there is promise of a hot fight for
the Republican nomination. The contest
ants in the Held are Hamilton Bauer, Big
Bettman, Daniel Ryan, E. B. Read. Ed
Beeler and Jacob Samuels.
Republican candidates for the Legisla
ture are coming to the front. In Sonoma
County Victor Piezza. of Santa. Rosa is
spoken of for the Assembly to represent
the Fourteenth District. In the Thir
teenth or Petaluma district there is talk
of giving the Republican nomination to F.
A. Cromwell. Sonoma County elects a
State Senator this year to succeed J. C.
Pirns. The Republicans expect to win
Judge R. F. Crawford of Santa Rosa is
mentioned as among the leading aspir
ants.
LEGISLATIVE ASPIRANTS.
The name of Gage was not mentioned in
the Republican Convention, of Tulare
County, held at Visalia. Resolutions were
adopted indorsing Thomas Flint for Gov
ernor and S. C. Smith for Congress.
Two weeks ago the machine politicians
were figuring that Gage would have 150
delegates in the State convention and
with such transferable strength would bo
able to dictate nominations. Reports
from the interior indicate that 150 is an
overestimate of the machine following.
One hundred will be nearer the mark and
Gage will fall below that number if he
fails to win out in Los Angeles. The
original purpose of the push to make an
open fight tor Gage delegates in San
Francisco has been abandoned. No doubt
efforts will be made to secretly run in a
lew delegates favorable to his renomina
tion. but the voters will be on their guard
to checkmate this game.

"I could tell a lot more, but epace will

efit of others." Mrs. A. T. Brown. Cen-
tral Station, W. Va.
"You may be sure I will recommend it
r<nd will guarantee a cure where the per-
pon will boil it long enough and drink
enough of it. I would do without a meal
for the sake of one cup of Postum.
"People say. 'You are looking so well;
what kind of medicine are you taking?'
1 tell them I have quit all kinds of medi-
cine and also coffee and am only using
Postum Coffee.
"Well, I have been using it since the
15th of July now, quite two months. I
have gained about 25 pounds. I gained
six pounds in 13 weeks, and can eat any-
thing I want and all that I want. My
ptomach never hurts me. I have gained
fctrength until now I can do ray own work
sr.d go to church every Sunday.
"The first making tasted so flat that it
mafle me half sick, but I determined to
gi%-e it a fair trial, so I read the directions
carefully and found that it must be boiled
et least fifteen minutes. Well, I boiled
it 25 minutes, then added some good
cream, and I tell you It was delicious. I
like it better than the ordinary coffee,
end, of course, stick to it.
"One day father told me he had been
reading how Postum Food Coffee helped
eo many people who were sick from cof-
fee drinking and he urged me to leave
off coffee and try Postum. I said, 'Oh,
father, I cannot try it and do not believe
it would do me any good,' but he per-
Fusded me to try a package.
"I finally gave up all hope of getting
veil. My stomach was in such condition
that everything but stale bread would
throw me into spasms. I nearly starved
n:yself, but never suspected that coffee
Â¦was the cause of all the trouble, nor did
I have any idea what the cause was.
A Virginia lady had en interesting ex-
periment with coffee poison. She says:
'For about five years I was troubled with
indigestion, weak stomach and palpita-
tion of the heart so bad that at times I
would fall and have to be carried into the
house. Finally I began to have spasms
and suffered untold misery. I tried all
kinds of patent medicines and different
doctors, only to get temporary relief.
There is no doubt that coffee secretly
end quietly causes an immense amount
cf misery to the human race, but in the
n-ajority cf cases the person does not
suspect the cause of the trouble.

FUNERAL REFORM BOYCOTT. '
The undertakers of Pah Francisco are un-
friendly to cremation because the expense 13
very much less than that of interment. They
know that if cremation sets thr? pace in fu-
neral reform reduced prices must be met, or
graveyards closed. They over five
hundred hacks, the drivers of which belong
to the Hackmen's Union. Local No. .224. That
union Uhrouoh misrepresentation j made . to
them) has resolved not to drive for us at our
funerals or rent hacks to attend them.
We think the friends of cremation wilt, if
necessary, dispense with, a string of, hack*
and the services of the undertakers rather
than see incineration obstructed by a cause-
less, heartless boycott of the dead.
We own two first-class carriages and at-
tractive hearses and horses, which we will
furnish upon application. For further . in-
formation-, call at .No.. 42ft Golden Gate ave.

Elizabeth Bonifas, was denied and within
a. short time the estate was partially dis
tributed to Mrs. Muir and Mrs. Curtis.
An appeal from- the verdict was taken,

received 5100,000 to withdraw "from the
contest.
Davis' will was offered for probate in
1?&6. Its admission was opposed by Jos

great deal of attention, was tried in De

was tried rendered a verdict declaring
the will valid.

Fifth Cavalry and later connected with

peared before Judge Fritz yesterday on a
charge of assault to murder for firing two
shots Saturday j nignt at Fred Hawes,
night clerk in the Winchester House.
Hawes was at nrst disinclined to swear to
a complaint, but finally 'consented.
It was not denied that Cameron fired the
shots, but it was urged for the defense
that ho was liquor-crazed. The shots
were fired into the elevator shaft and it
was claimed that they were fired simply
with the intention of frightening Hawes.
Cameron is dying from tuberculosis and
was on his way from Manila to a sani

prolonging his life when arrested. He
showed numerous letters testifying
to his good character while serving in the

The Grand Jury filed a secret indict

court. The specific charge found against
Conway Is that of felony embezzlement,
and consists in the alleged misappropria

' Bail was fixed by Judge Murasky in the
sum of $5000, and a bench warrant was
ordered issued for the arrest of Conway,
who has disappeared.

Martin Stevens claimed that as Mrs.
Baker is not personally interested In the
fcuit she has no need of a representative.
George D. Collins, who is the attorney
for Minerva' Parlor, strove to adjust mat
ters by acknowledging Stevens, but his
interference only served to arouse the ire
of Nougues. Nougues promptly accused
Collins of being in the case only for the
purpose of collecting a fee. Collins re
torted that Nougues was not in it at all
and requested him to retire and ensconce
himself in the tall grass.
The case was postponed Until Friday in
order to give Stevens time to familiarize
himself with the question in dispute.
This is the second time that the matter
has been postponed. It was postponed
Monday because the representative of the
Grand Parlor did not put in an appear
ance.
The dispute which for many months
past has been brewing between the Grand
Parlor of Native Daughters and Minerva
Parlor over the granting of a charter to
Genevieve Parlor has even embroiled the
lawyers representing the factions. When
the matter came up for argument yester
day Attorney Charles Nougues and Attor
ney Martin Stevens had a spirited dispute
over who was to have the honor of rep
resenting the Grand Parlor. Nougues'
ciaim to the distinction is based on the
fact that Peter F. Dunne, with whose of
fice he is connected, is the attorney of
Mrs. Genevieve Baker, and that as Mr.
Dunne is at present out of the city tho
duty of looking after the past grand
president's interests in the case devolves
upon him.

According to the complaint filed by
Mrs. Weisman. Mrs. MorriU and the

of ruining her reputation. She alleges
that they have circulated rumors that she
"would settle the case out of court" and
that she "would compromise with Mrs.
Morrill." all of which, alleges Mrs. Weis
man, is a base fabrication.
The Morrills, Mrs. Weisman and the
Winks are very bitter toward each
other, judging from the complaints filed
by Mrs. Weisman and Mrs. Morrill. Ac
cording to Mrs. Morrill. Mrs. Weisman
won Dr. Morrill's affections and induced
him to leave his home and travel about
the State with her, ending their travels
by a trip to Honolulu, where, alleges Mrs.
Morrill. they remained for three months.

CF. RICHARDS, a pioneer. drug
merchant of this city, died last
Sunday afternoon at his resi-
O dence, SOI ' Pennsylvania ave
nue. Death was due to apo
plexy, and was entirely unexpected.,Rich
ards had but recently returned from a.
trip to Yosemite Valley, and up to the
time of his death was apparently in the
best of health. Besides being well known
in the business world, he was also known
in literary circles, as in years past he had
frequently contributed short stories and
poems to the Golden Era and^Alta Cali
fornia, pioneer publications of nhis State.
Richards was born in Redbank, N. J.,
in 1842, and came to California in 1S62. He
was probably best known to the people
of this city in connection with the drug
business, which he conducted for thirty
years at the corner of Clay and Sansome
streets. Recently he removed to 406 Clay
street.
He leaves a wife and four children. The
funeral will be held to-day.
The officials of the Western National
Bank have assured the police that they
will aid in every way if it is determined
to prosecute Block for what he did In this
city. It is possible, however, that Block
may be surrendered to Eastern authori
ties, where his operations assumed great
er magnitude than they did in San Fran
â¢cisco.
The police believe that there will be no
difficulty in proving that Stone and Block
are the same person, although the prison
er claims that the drafts were given him
by another man and that he believed them
to be genuine.
In some respects the prisoner is rather
remarkable. He is well dressed and has
handsome jewelry, and when searched at
the City Prison had $1700 in currency on
his person. He maintains an absolute
silence, regarding himself and hi3 previous
movements, and no amount of questioning
can draw from him any admissions. â¢ Tlje
detectives have not been able to locate
his stopping place in this city, but when
they do they expect to get conclusive evi
dence against him.
A telegram from the National Hotel
keepers' Association at New York, re
ceived yesterday by Captain Martin, ,ask
ed that John O. Stone be held for numer
ous fraudulent transactions, and stating
that Cashier Clark of the Palace would
know the particulars. Clark was unable
to throw any light on the case when ques
tioned last night.
Investigation of the records taken in
connection with papers found on the pris
oner convince the police that Block is
one of a gang which has been victimizing
hotel keepers and banks through the
Southern and Middle Western States for a
year past. They are said to have cleared
up $75 000 by their operations.
On the prisoner's person were found a
number of drafts for large sums on banks
in Indianapolis, Cleveland, New York and
other cities, payable to R. M. Jones, G. A.
Graves, John O. Stone and other names.
These names in! many instances corre
spond with those on bogus drafts drawn
in the name of the Earl Fruit and Pro
duce Company of California, on the Amer
ican Bank and Trust Company of San
Francisco and the First National Bank of
San Jose. These drafts have been scat
tered broadcast throughout the United
States, and fully $100,000 has been realized.
The swindle has been going on foe many
months past, and the police of nearly all
the large cities in the United States have
been endeavoring unsuccessfully to locate
the criminals. On the back of one of the
drafts found on the prisoner was written
the name of the Earl Fruit and Produce
Company. . â¢â¢ ;
According to the police, Block came to
San Francisco about two weeks ago and
at once commenced laying his plans lor
a, large banK swindle, jtie selected tne
western iNational Bank as a victim and
a tew days ago opened an account there
by depositing $17i>. .Later he deposited a
draft for $1000 pn the Springrield National
Bank of bpringfleld, Mass., payable to J.
O. fatone, and two cnecKs aggregating |9uO
on the Bank of Santa Clara at San Jose.
Against this account he drew a check
last Saturday for $35, which was paid, -and
on Monday he presented a check for $20U0.
which, nearly exhausted his credit, but
which the bank officials refused to cash.
In the meantime they had telegraphed to
the Sprinttgeld, Mass., bank and ascer
tained that the $1000 draft was forged, and
Monday afternoon the two checKs came
back from San Jose protested. The police
were, immediately notified and the detec
tives promptly located Block and took
him into custody.
Shortly- after he was arrested a telegram
was received from the city marshal of
Springfield. Mass., asking for the arrest
of J. O. Stone, and giving a description
that exactly suited Block. From this it
is supposed that the Springfield bank has
already been victimized by him, and that
he is known there. â¢
As was published exclusively in The
Call,- the arrest of J. Block by Detectives
George McMahon and Ross Whittaker
Monday night has developed into an im
portant capture. Block was taken in cus
tody at the request of Cashier Scott of the
Western National Bank of this city, and
his identity 'and , the reason for his de
tention were carefully suppressed by the
police until last night, when Captain- of
Detectives Martin gave publicity to the
facts in the case.
The point of respondents is correct and la
supported by authority. Under out theory of
government, there is no property right in an
of flee; offices are considered to subserve the
public interests and are not for the benefit
of the occupant thereof, and when the term
is not fixed by law, there is no reason why the
power to appoint should not also possess the
power to remove at its pleasure and such as
shown, has been the practice.
Dr. Sponogle was appointed superin
tendent of Agnews Insane Asylum on
April 25. 1S97. On August 23, 1833, he was
dismissed without a hearing and Dr. J.
H. Crane put in his place. Sponogle made
a petition to the Superior Court of Santa
Clara county for a writ of certiorari
compelling the managers of the asylum
to reinstate him. The petition was denied
and an appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court. The contention of the appellant
was that he could not legally have been
removed except for cause and after
charges had been preferred and he had
been given an- opportunity to make re
ply and, secondly, that his term of office
having once been appointed, was for four
years. The managers claimed on the
other hand that the law which denies the
right of removal except for cause was
unconstitutional and, in regard to the
length of the term of office, that the
lunacy law of 1897 superseded all pre
vious enactments on the subject. The
Supreme Court sustains the position of
the managers as follows:
I concur in the Judgment. The Injunction
order In Crowley vs. Freud prohibits the Civil
Service Commission from holding examinations
or the employes of the Recorder â such as copy
ists and stenographers â as well as his deputies.
The Recorder is therefore driven to the neces
sity of employing such assistants without civil
service examinations or not at all: and unless
such employes can be paid, the business of the
office would be practically suspended. I do not,
however, think that the employes referred to
are deputies within the meaning of the law;
nor is it necessary to so hold in order to
affirm the Judgment. â¢
The dispute as to the status of copy
ists was raised by Treasurer Brooks in
refusing to pay W. H. Garnett for one
month's labors in the Recorder's office.
The position of several other employes in
the same office depended on the settle
ment of the dispute. The Supreme Court
affirms without reservation the Judgment
of the lower court and quotes a large
part of the former decision as the ground
work for its own opinion.
In the case of Crowley vs. Freud, the
Supreme Court declared that the deputies
of the Recorder could not be appointed
by the Civil Service Commission. In the
piesent case the contention of the com
mission was that copyists are not depu
ties. It is held by the court that depu
ties need not "be considered in any nar
row sense, but are in reality any and all
subordinates in any county office. The
opinion is written by Justice McFarland,
with whom Chief Justice Beatty and Jus
tices Garoutte and Temple directly con
cur. Jjustice Van Dyke writes the follow
ing concurring opinion:
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that the Recorder and not the Civil Ser
vice Commission has the right to apooint
copyists in the office of the former and
that the Treasurer must cash the salary
â¢warrants of such employes. The Board
of Manager a of the Agnews State Hos
pital for the Insane were also upheld in
ousting Dr. F. M. Sponogle from the su
perintendency of that .institution in 18tt9.

Something for Mothers to Think About
EVERY CHILD born into the world with an inherited
or early developed tendency to distressing, disfiguring
humours of the skin, scalp, and blood, becomes an object
of the most tender solicitude, not only because of' its suf-
fering but because of the dreadful fear that the disfigura-
tion is to be lifelong and mar its future happiness and
prosperity. Hence it becomes the duty of mothers of
such afflicted children to acquaint themselves with the
best, the purest, and most effective treatment available,
viz., THE CUTICURA TREATMENT.
