STRONG EVIDENCE IMiP-W'B&WWiSSItSSWR OF POLICE
CONNECTING SUSPECT WITH NORA FULLER'S DISAPPEARANCE
ELEANOR HAUDE FULLER, "WHO WAS LURED TO DEATH WHILE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT.
When Seifert was searched by tho constables a marked clip
ping of a San Francisco newspaper relating to tho Stanford House
on Sutter street, and tho suspicion that Seifert had stopped there
under the name of Pearce, was found in his pocket. .
Detective Callundan of tho Morso Afienoy and Dotootivo Hamill
cf tho local detootlvo foroo arrived In Woodland two hours after
Seifert had left with tho constables hot on his trail. They had
been shadowing him In his mad flight, but ho had maintained a
good lead on them.
Tho Woodland constables were notified that tho mud-boipnt
tcrcd traveler was tho man Self art, who was wanted by tho San
Froncleco polloo, and they at onoo started on his trail. Ho boat
them to EepartoÂ» oonooallno himself there In a vaoant house,
whoro ho wasfound after a long soaroh. /
* SEIFERT CONCEALS HIMSELF.
Seifert reached Davisville by train early yesterday morning
and at once took a team and drove to Woodland. There ho "en
gaged another tenm and started west. An attorney who at ono
time had him for a client recognized him, although he had removed
his mustache and in other ways sought to esoapd Identification,
Seifert was formerly a druggist nt-Woodland and ho did not tarry
there apparently fearing that ho might bo rcoogniiod nny mo
ment. . /
Whatever may have been tho man's relations to Nora Fuller
and the girls with whom she associated, he has been the, one ob
ject toward which the combined efforts of the public and private
detectives of Snn Francisco have been directed for two weeks
past. Chief of Police Wittman gained 'knowledge of the many
suspicious circumstances in which Seifert Was involved and his
sudden disappearance from his usual haunts, and at once started
detectives upon his trail. Fearing that tho presence in small
towns of so many of his deteotives would put the fugitive from his
guard, tho Chief of Police enlisted the services of Harry Morse's
Detective Agency, and the Morse detectives havo -followed per
sistently the trail of Seifert as he passed around the bay, always
keeping his identity hidden and careful to avoid attracting atten
tion. A dozen times during tho chase the detectives were close
upon his heels, only to find in eachcaso that the quarry had cs-

On January 1 of this year C.
A. Seifert registered at the Win
chester House, on Third street;
He occupied the room until the
3m of the month. The room
he occupied was No. 419, and
when he stopped rooming at the
hotel he did not notify the man-
Pnt that he was going to do
d left a trunk and all his
personal property in the room.
The night clerk of the hotel,
Seifert has a wife who is said
to be Jiving at Monterey. To
some friends recently she is al
leged to have confided her inten
tion of applying for a divorce.
Seifert often wore a silk hat
and a frock coat, and was fond
of the society of young girls. He
is said to have passed a number
of small checks drawn on the
Western National Bank that were
returned as valueless. So far as
known no complaints have been
filed against him on this score.
When Seifert was arranging
fof his perfumery counter he
became acquainted with Emma
Scaright, an acquaintance of
Nora Fuller, aiul engaged her
services tu sell perfumery for
him. She reported for duty sev
eral days, but Seifert never
appeared nt 710 Market street
after he made his first arrange
ments. It is thought he became
acquainted with Xora Fuller
through Emma Searight; and
may have knowledge of ctthcr
men who knew her. Whether
anything was found among his
effects to connect him with the
case the police refuse to disclose.
In fact they will not admit thai
his arrest has anything to do
with the Fuller case.
Hi* 'first venture was to con
tract with Charles Conklin, tlu
ticket-broker, for a portion of the
floor hpacc of the premises at 710
Market street, representing tlint
he intended installing a perfumery
counter. He did not pay any
rent, but had some effects moved
in, including a desk and some
medical book's, Then he sublet a
portion of the place to T. R. Les
ter, receiving $60 on the rcpre
hcntation that he had paid three
months' rent in advance, When
Lester ascertained that Seifert
had no claim on the preniiseg he
eccured a warrant for the Inner'*
arrest. Seifert refunded $$$ of
the money nnd promised to pay
the balance. *u the charge wn*
not pressed; although the warren)
waÂ§ left in the hand* 61 the poÂ»
lfce, Upon thb old 'complaint
Dcteetlvo Haiiijli and Captflln
Calluiidflri arrested Seifert yn>
temay.
Seifert is a man about 38 years
of age, 5 feet 8 inches in height,
blond, and formerly wore a mus
tache. He is a licensed phaniia*
cist, and once owned a drugstore
in Woodland. Nearly all the
time he has been in San Fron>
cisco he has been employed as a
solicitor. \ih last occupation,
was soliciting advertisements and
floor space patronage for the Ju
venile Fairyland Carnival, at the
Mechanics' 1'avilion. When he
first came to San Franciico he
was accompanied by his wife, and

The coppers struggled manfully' with
their examination papers and sighed with
relief when they completed their strenu
ous work. "If I had. known It was so
hard I'd never have g-onÂ© to the front,'
said one member of the force. "When I
received my papers," said another, "I
clean forgot all I knew. Imagine a fellow
trying to enawer: 'How often and in .
what manner do. you clean your re
\olver and cartridges? Give reasons for
Keeping: your weapon and cartridges
clean.' My first idea was to answer: '"To
ke<?p your back pocket clean."
One patrolman was disappointed. He
had primed himself with answers to the
following Questions, but they were not
asked:
Why should the spirit of mortal be
proud?
When was the first fantan gamo dis
covered in Chinatown?
Did Schley or Sampson command at
If a man offered you a 550 tip, would

. When is a hen?
When were goats first discovered on
Telegraph Hill?
The examination papers were three In
number and contained Questions in police
procedure, arithmetic and making out of
reports. They were distributed by Edwin
F. Moran, chief examiner. The candidates
for promotion were seated an long tables
in the assembly hall of the Girls', High
School. Mr. Moran told the men what
tbey had to do. and gave the signal to
commence at 1:20 p. m. Before an hour
had passed nngera were covered with ink,
beads of perspiration stood out on fore
heads, and many wished they were pa
trolling their beats. If a man desired to
leave the room he was taken In tow by
a clerk of the Civil Service Commission.
The officers had to write a report on
killing a horse that fell down and broke
its legs. One of the officers said he sub
mitted the following:
If 4 men can do a piece of work In 5
days, how long will it take 6 policemen to
do the same work in 3 days?
This question proved difficult to answer.
The candidates . lost -weight trting to
'-think of the correct answer. Louis Sayres
and "Slats" Sullivan counted their fingers
until they were blue In tÂ£e face; Dan
Sylvester did a monologue that contained
harsh words; Officers Magee and - Beach
wished they had. the Marconi system per
fected; Phil Fryer regretted that like
Caesar he was ambitious; Officer Knight
reduced his weight -worrying over an
answer; Policeman Chappelle imagined
that policemen, should not be compelled to
â¢work, and one officer grew dizzy over the
question and gave up the struggle. On
his examination paper was found writ
ten in a shaky hand: "If I have to be so
well educated to be a policeman, I will go
back to the minea."
The Civil Service Commissioners will
devoto the next two weeks to an examina
tion cf the papers, and will then render
their decision. . ;.Â¦ ;

Then .he resumed hia seat, amid gasps

spectators. Burrows hastened to the desks
of the official stenographers and directed
that Tillman's words be written but at
once. At the conclusion of. the roll call,
Â¦but before the announcement of the vote,
Kean of- New Jersey, who had voted for
the resolution, addressed the president
pro tem,; saying: , ..
."/Having heard the Senator from South
Carolina (Tlllman) again insult the Sen
ate,:! change my .vote from, aye to no.".
The resolution Â¦ was adoptedâ 54 to 13â the
detailed vote being as follows:
"Among gentlemen," said he, slowly,
and hls v words were heard distinctly in
the uttermost parts of the chamber, "an
apology for an offense committed under
the; heat of blood/is usually, considered
sufficient." T ii)jT 7ii 1 ~t_7iT |r ''i 1HM Mm
When Tlllman's name was called : he
rose deliberately. Every eye in the cham
ber, was fixed upon him. His. face was
stern and. set -and he. was very pale. Evi
dently he was laboring under great emo
tion. 1 \
"Among Gentlemen," He Says.
"Being related by kinship to one of the
Senators involved, â¢ I ask to be excused
from voting." The request was granted.
I McLcLurln of South Carolina, one of the
offending Senators, said In response to his
name, which had been restored to the
roll: "I refrain from voting for obvious
reasons."
-t- Bacon called attention to hwat he con
sidered an important omission in the nar
rative, by the majority of the occurrences
of last Saturday. There was no official
record of . the proceedings in the secret
(executive) session, he said, but some Of
the salient facts ought to be brought out.
He said that the senior Senator from
South Carolina (Tillman) had expressed
his desire, through the Senator from Ken
tucky (Blackburn), to make public ac
knowledgment of his error and to apolo
gize' to the Senate. The junior Senator
f rota South Carolina (McLaurln) had ex
pressed the same desire through him (Ba
con). He deemed it important that the
facts should be made a part pf the record.
Galllnger said that under the ' Senate
rules it was not competent to move a sub
stitute minority for a majority report,
otherwise he would move to substitute the
minority report for that of the majority,
as he believed the minority report recom
mended the precise kind of punishment
that ought to be inflicted on the Senators
involved. [ The minority report, he thought,
properly differentiated between the de
grees of offense committed by the Sena
tors. In the circumstances ho felt con
strained to vote for, the resolution. When
the name of McLaurln 'of, Mississippi was
reached in the roll call he said:
Both Men Penitent.
I concur in oil the foregoing views except
as to the pnlshment of the Junior Senator from
South Carolina. It Is my opinion that the
punishment he has already suffered - Is ade
quate to his offense. .1 make no recommenda
tion as the Â¦ punishment < to be Imposed on the
senior Senator from South Qirollna.
The .objection that no punishment should de
prive a sovereign State of its votes In the
Senate falls when we consider the rights - of
all the States, and, above, all, the duty of the
Senate to punish adequately 'a grave offense.
Pritchard's addition to the above state
ment is in the following language:
constitution,, conferring upon each house
of Congress power to punish its members
for disorderly? behavior. The report con
cludes by recommending that Senator
McLaurin be suspended from his func
tions as a Senator, for five days, and that
Senator Tillman . be suspended for twen
ty-five days.-. They odd: .

c Gravity of the Crime.
The penalty of a- censure by the Senate in
the nature of things must. vary in actual se
verity In proportion to the. public sense of the
gravity of the offense, of which the offender
should be adjudged guilty. Therefore, notwith
standing the fact that in the opinion of the
majority of the committee there is a defense of
the gravity of the offense under consideration,
your committee Is of opinion that public good
and the dignity of the Senate will alike be best
promoted and protected, so far as this particu
lar- case 1b concerned, by imposing upon . each
Senator by formal vote the censure of the Sen
ate for' the, offense by; him 'committed, and
therefore recommend that adoption of the.res
olution. Â¦ . .'Â¦'Â¦Â¦
At the conclusion of the reading of the
majority report . Bailey offered the fol
lowing statement as representing the
views of himself and four, other Senators,
as follows: , â¢
We dissent from eojnuch of the report of the
committee as ? asserts the power of the Senate
to suspend a Senator and thus deprive a State
of Its vote, and so much as ' describes the of
fenses of the Senators as of different gravity;

Such a charge, under any circumstances,
should be resented by any man worthy to be a
Senator; but, made ae it was, In this Instance,
its offenslveness was greatly Intensified nnt.1 the
result must have been foreseen by Mr. Tlllman
if he took any thought, as he should, of the
consequences of his statements. This feature
of his offense, coupled with the fact that he
also commenced the encounter by quitting his
Beat some distance away/ from Mr. McLaurln,
and. rushing violently upon him, struck him
in the face, makes the case one of such ex
ceptional misbehavior that a majority of the
committee are of opinion that this offense was
of much greater gravity than that of Mr. Mc-
Laurin. '-naS*** .
Tlie Offense of Tillman.
In the case of Mr. Tlllman the record shows
that thÂ« altercation was commenced by the
charge made against Mr. McLaurln. Such a
charge Is Inexcusable except' In connection
with a resolution to Investigate. Mr. Tlllman
not only made the charge without any avowal
of a, purpose to. investigate, but also disclaim
ing knowledge of evidence to establish the
offense and this he said after the charge had
been specifically and unqualifiedly denied by
Mr. McLaurln.. . '
After the reading of the, resolution by
the clerk Burrows presented the report of
the majority of the committee, saying in
that connection it was understood, that
those members of the committee who did
not agree with the majority should have
opportunity to present their views. Mc-
Comas of Maryland said he would sub
mit the views: of the minority. The re
port of the majority. was then read. The
report presented the history of the alter
cation in the Senate and quoted the lan
guage then used by the Senators. All
agreed to this statement. The report then
continued as follows:
That the conduct of the two Senators was an
Infringement on the privileges of the Senate,
a violation of its rules and derogatory to i its
high character, tending to bring the body itself
Into public contempt, cannot be questioned . or
denied. ' Indeed- the Senate by unanimous vote
has already placed ;on records" condemnation
of the Senators, by declaring*; both guilty of
contempt. The majority of the committee are
of opinion that the legal effect of- adjudging
these Senators In contempt of the Senate was
to suspend their functions' as Senators, and
that such a punishment for dlsojOerly behavior
was clearly within the power of .the Senate,
"but the conclusion they have reached makes it
unnecessary to discuss this question:
The offenses committed by the. two Senators
were not. In the opinion of a majority of the
committee, of equal gravity. The charge made
by Mr. Tlllman had been before In the Senate
specifically denied in carllamentary language
by Mr. McLaurin. The offense charged against
Mr. McLaurln was among the most reprehen
sible a Senator could commit. .He could not
Ignore it or fall to refute it and hope to be
longer respected as either a man or a Senator.
Mr. McLaurin did not commence the encounter,
but only stood In his place at his desk, where
he. was speaking, and resisted the attack that
was made upon him. In other words, his of
fense was confined to the use of unparliament
ary language, for which ho had unusual provo-^
cation. Nevertheless, his offense was a viola
tion of the rules of the Senate of so verlous a
character that in the opinion of the committee
It should be condemned.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â Senators Mo-
LAurln and Tlllman .were; to-day severely.

clones the incident, so far as McLaurln or

The Scammell was leaking slightly when
she left Manila, but the storms strained
her hull early in the voyage, and the
windmill was unable to pump out the
water as. fast as it came in. The hand
pumps, were rigged and kept
going until the vessel anchored. She has
been outside -for -several --days, and yes
terday was . the first vessel to cross the
â¢ bar. " r
The Nova Scotjan. ship Fred E.' Scam
mell reached -port yesterday, eighty-three
days out from. Manila, leaving almost
from port to port a trail of oil and arriv
-Ing with a crew well high worn out with
constant working of the j pumps. The
Scammell at tier anchorage in the bay is
leaking at the rate of four or fl\'e inches
an hour and , the - pumps Â¦ have- â¢ to be
manned every sixty minutes. How much
pumping was required when her hull was
strained by the pressure, of* her canvas
cau be Imagined from the worn-out ap
pearance of the crew. Storms beset the
Scammell from the outset of her voyage.
In more moderate doses- the storms' would
have been fair winds, but, although blow
ing in the direction | toward which ! the'
bark was bound, she was unable to take
advantage of them. She was hove to for
many days at a time. Captain Campling
â¢says he -has never before experienced such
continuously terrific weather. During the
entire 'trip oil bags were kept 'over the
bark's sides, and in a little oily sea of
her own she rode safely through the sur
rounding turmoil.
Oils Her Way From Manila.
Before the outward bound fleet had
cleared the bar the white sails of the in
ward bound craft began to climb over
the horizon. The Inward procession con
tinued until sundown, and .will keep up
for several days if the weather continues
In favorable. mood.
Twenty-six vessels sailed yesterday
from this port, and more than half the
number were grain laden merchantmen
that were roady for sea some time ago.
The others included storm bound coasters,
the lightship bound for her station, on
' thfi' bar. and the IT. S. 8. McCullocb in
search of the disabled bark Northwest. â¢
large fleets were able to exchange
places. The barbound grain carriers,
which have been crowding the bay anchor
ages for the past week, were towed out
to sea and started on their travels to the
Old World. A number of the Inward bound
craft that have been hovering for many
days outside the Golden Gate, passed over
the etill heaving bar and occupied the
places vacated by the outward bound.
When the sun went down Thursday th*
harbor was crowded with ships of many
rations, all deeply laden with the grain
of California's last harvest. They had
been waiting day after day for the bar
breakers to subside. The fieet had grown
from one ship to a score. More had com
pleted their cargoes and the anchorages
were getting uncomfortably crowded.
The change came suddenly. Shortly
after midnight John Hyslop, the Merj
chants' Exchange lookout at Point Lo
bos, reported a truce in the war of waves
on the banks of the bar. By 2:30 a. m.
there were no breakers in sight, and the
Oceanic Steamship Company's big liner
Sonoma pulled up her anchor and crossed
out Into the Pacific. Every towboat in
the harbor was soon busy. There was a
period of noisy whistling and hoarse
shouting, and in the course of an hour
or. so the barbound fleet was heading In
processional order for the open sea. Be
fore the sun had time' to clear away the
early morning moisture more than twenty
. vessels had passed through the Golden
Â¦ Gate.

FAKIRâ 8., City. ' Fake has come to
mean in the United States a story without
foundation and those who write or cir
culate such are called fakirs or fakers.
Borne have attained an unenviable repu
tation in press circles by their Indulgence
in this practice. Fake In England Is to
cheat and swindle; to fake away 1* an
encouragement, riven by. thieves to com
panions. The word fake is a word that
has been used for more than half a cen
tury In the theatrical profession to ex
press the idea of a makeshift. Thus to
fake a dress is to get up a costume that
is not correct, but which can be mado to
serve its purpose on a pinch. Costumes
of this kind are called fakements. To
fake a play is to play it Imperfectly, that
is. without proper knowlcdgo of tho lines*
men given to this sort of thing are known
as fakirs in tho profession. The word
fakir is npplted in India to a religious
mendicant.

DROPSYâ D. J. C, City. The % symptoms
of general dropsy are: First, a swelling
around the ankle and leg, which is more
visible at night after standing and walk
ing, and is less perceptible in the morn
ing in consequence of the horizontal posi
tion in the night. To the touch of another
person dropsical feet and legs feel a little
colder than natural,* and when hard
pressed with the finger a pit will be
sunk In the flesh which remains some
time before it fills up again. As the dis
ease advances, the skin of the leg be
comes smooth and shining, and some
times even cracks open to let out the
watery fluid that has accumulated, under
the skin. If the disease is treated at the
Inception it may succumb. Its seriousness
depends upon conditions and what caused
it.

PERSONAL MENTION.
He treats the subject as lightly as if he were dis
cussing a minor change in his order for dinner. Sup
pose that his protean policy were in operation, and at
this moment we should change to a statutory silver
standard, foreign exchange, which is now about 4
per cent premium, would rise to about $2.64. But he
doc* not at all comprehend what that would mean.
He has no conception of the strain and , stress it
Â«vou!d bring to business. He would go into the mar
ketplace with silver dollars in his pocket and pay
more than twice as much for the necessaries of life
and declare that values had risen. But values would
be where they were before, measured in the' natural
standard, gold. Mr. Bryan would merely have im-v
posed an artificial medium, depreciated and fluctuat
ing, and the *.cllm of property would be exacting
each day enough of that base medium to measure in
Hold the value of what they sold. The people com
prehend this and have .<aid so in two national elec
tions, but it remains a mystery, to, Mr. Bryan, who
':*Â¦ joined to his idols, and the people have decided to
let- him alouc ,
It is not surprising, therefore, that Mr. Bryan per
sists in harking back to the battle of the standards,
and insists that it shall be renewed. In a late issue
of his newspaper he says:
"Under our form of government no unchangeable 1
system can be established. If the people try the gold .
standard and do not like'it, they can change it; if
they try the double standard and do not like: it, they
can change it; if they try one ratio and do not like it,
they can try another." . â¢ . \
It is not strange that he does not grow.* Men
grow by the study of natural law, by profound con
templation of adjustment to its decrees. But when
a man ties his faith to artifice there is no progress
possible to him.
IT. has been supposed that the battle of the stan
dard! is over, and that no politician or pa r ty
leader would endeavor to renew it. The gold
ttandard lias been established by law. In that re
fcpfct the fetaUtte ha* merely affirmed an existing
financial and commercial fact. Gold is the actual
uandard by natural selection, end would eo remain
in ipito of all that Mr, Drynn might do if he were
President nnd hnd ft Congress to support him.
Jackson et&ted the law of natural selection of a stan
dard when be said, ''Gold iÂ§ the universal and only
lioflcrt itandard of value," Other and dishonest
Mandards nifty be artificially imposed upon the people
by mistaken legislation, but their imposition causes
(-nutation, lots and distress among the people. It
wakes necessary a daily readjustment of prices and
causes startling fluctuations in exchange, makes the
operations of business uncertain and sadly Unsettles
all human affairs that depend upon property and its
stability. As we have rcc^jitly shown, Mexico is just
now getting her eyes open to the fact that gold is the
universal standard, and her local silver standard has
to be measured in it in all external transactions.
Within four months her 6ilver standard depreciated
over 50 per cent, and then within thirty days recov
ered neariy half of thai loss and then fell down again.
Mr. Bryan has never had any knowledge of the
effect upon business of a depreciated and fluctuating"
artificial standard, oppo.scd to the natural standard.
He docs rot appreciate the meaning of a natural
standard. It is natural, because al! men seek to meas
ure the vj.lue of their possessions in a medium that
has the minimum instead of the maximum of fluctu
ation. They seek some form of property that derives
its value, and the stability thereof, from the source of
all value, which is human desire, and they make this
convertible into all other forms of property and all
other forms convertible into it. This is a natural stan
dard of value, which becomes the medium of exchange
by measuring all media of exchange by it. Of all this
Mr. Bryan has no conception. It was well charged
against him by the gold Democrats in 1896 and again
in 1900 that he is not a Democrat, because he believes
that value is not created by human desire, a natural
process, but by legislation, an artificial process. The
gold Democrats defined statesmanship to be the
alignment of legislation with the irrepealable laws of
nature, and they believed that Bryan would not rec
ognize a law of nature if he met it in the highway,
placarded back and front like a sandwich man.
BIMETALLIC BRYAN.
Evidently there is here a proof that there is a
m,arked difference of opinion as to what constitutes
a good novel. The rule providing that no novel be
purchased within a year after its publication would
save librarians the task of deciding, between these
differences of judgment.* It would delay the purchase
of many a good book and not prevent , later on
the purchase of many a bad one; but still it would
save expense, and that is always something even to
librarians.
Inthis connection it is worth noting that many
books that have had years of popularity in this coun
try and in England have found but little demand; in
Germany when translated into German. Figures re
cently published by cne of the leading publishers in
Stuttgart show that a translation of BarrieV "Win
dow in Thrums" in two years reached a sale of 202
copies. Blackmore's "Lorna Doone" in seven years
has sold 825 copies. Miss Corelli's "Romance j-of
Two Worlds" in the same time has sold 688 copies.
Crawford's "A Cigarette-maker's Romance" in eight
years has sold 513 copies. Miss Wilkins' "Short
Stories" have sold 417 copies in eight years; Miss
Howard's "Guenn" 967 in twelve years, and Haw
thorne's "Scarlet Letter" 507. in four years.
These considerations of course apply almost wholly
to libraries maintained by* taxation or by liberal en
dowments. Subscription libraries must perforce pro
vide the books required by the subscribers. The only
way for them to avoid the purchase of a mass of
worthless novels would be to educate their sub
scribers up to the point of preferring what is best
jather than what is latest. It happens, however, that
a good many people unite with subscription libraries
solely for the purpose of obtaining the new books
without having to go to the expense of purchasing
them for themselves. To such persons the adoption
of the proposed rule would render a library compara-
Along with the moral idea of promoting a taste
for good literature goes the desire on the part of the
librarians to save money. The purchase of novels
that live- but a year is money thrown away. In order
to supply the demand for a book that is having a
run librarians in a large city have to purchase many
copies, and within six months the demand for the
work may cease altogether. On the other hand,
money expended for books of lasting interest is in
the nature of an investment. It adds to the perma
nent value of the library and serves the constant de
mand of readers. . , . .
Mr. Putnam of the Congressional library in h
btrong advocate of the proposed, rule, and ha has
Intely been supported by. Mr. Carnegie, who, while
not n 1 librarian, tons no doubt a large knowledge of
what soft of books ougtot to be supplied to the pub
lic by free libraries. These gentlemen maintain that
one of the functions of a public library in to form
popular tnste and to direct it toward good literature.
At the preient time novel* are publiiiicd in shoals,
They lisue from the presi by the hundred!*. The
greater part of them 'are ..worthless, and many are
worse than worthless. The reading' of such stuff de
grades the intellect until it becomes incapable of any
longer distinguishing good literature from trash,
In fact, many persons easily drift into such a mental
condition that they prefer the trash, A public library,
say the reformers, should stand as a guard against
that evil. It should refuse to purchase and circulate
dozens of copies of some book for which the public
has developed a passing craze, and should circulate
no novel that has not stood the test of at least one
year of time.
EASTERN librarians are just now discussing
1 with much earnestness the e^)cdicncy of
adopting a rule excluding new novels from
their shelves until a year after publication. The ar
gument for the rule h that a large number of new
novels have no value whatever; that the demand for
them does not outlive the year of their publication,
and that by excluding them for that period libraries
would be saved the expense of buying many of them
and relieved from the risk of becoming the purvey-
The radicals of the party, however, were not will
ing to accept Roseberji even upon the basis suggested'
by the moderates. In reply to the argument that
Rosebery would be potent in bringing forward Eng
lish reforms even if he did not go to the full extent
oMiome rule for Ireland, one of the opponents of the
resolution said that if the Liberal party abandoned
the home rule programme they would not elect a
single member of the Commons irbm Leeds at the
next election. Another said that if the Liberals are'
to wait until they have an English majority they
would never have reform at all. He went on to add:
"In only two Parliaments since 1832 has there been a
Liberal majority from England. _ There would neve
have: been any reform in England itself but for the
Welsh, the Scotch and the Irish."
It appears from this expression of Liberal opinion
that the masses of the party are by no means enthu
siastic over the Rosebery leadership. , They will ac
cept him much as the Bryanite Democracy might ac
cept the lead of a gold Democrat, for the sake of
temporary success, but they remain true to their con
victions, and, moreover, they doubtless hold the be
lief that once in office Rosebery himself would be
forced to accept an Irish programme for the sake of
getting Irish votes for the reforms he desires in Eng
land. Some. of them even go so far as'to hold that
a change may come over the mind of the leader even
before he gets office, or, as one of the speakers at
the Leeds meeting said: "Lord Rosebery will have
plenty of time before the next general election to
blossom into a full-blown radical."
The "J.eedi Liberal Thousand" recently held ; a
crowded meeting ami indorsed a resolution for
warded by the executive committee to Rouebery ap
proving lib programme. The indorsement, how
ever, wnÂ«. by no menni emphatic, and was preceded
by 11 long nnd ipirited debate. The ftupporters of the
rt'iohtfloii admitted there would not be much enthti
ijaim for the "i'Jean slate" polity, but they argued
that it wduld'tiot imply any surrender", of principle.
One speaker is reported by the Westminster Gazette
at saying: "As to the 'clean state/ he thought Lord'
Rosebery infant they should not hustle each other in
their projects, tint be willing to take their turn," The
chairman of the meeting in summing up the Issue
fdid: "When Lord Rosebery told them that they
ought 'to wipe the slate clean f he meant only that
they should wipe off the programnics upon it, but he
did not mean to say they should wipe away their
political convictions."
A resolution based upon such a construction of his
Lordship's words can hardly be deemed a complete
indorsement. In facf, the vote seems to have ex
pressed no more than a willingness to accept aid
from whatever source it came. The chairman said:
"We want Lord Rosebery back because he is a man
of genius, an orator, a leader of men. We want him
back because there is work for him to do â to end
the miserable war â to take up domestic questions."
WHETHER British Liberalism shall com
bine with the Irish party or cut loose from
it and resolve not to take office until it has
a majority of English and Scottish members of the
Commons behind it is a question that is now agitat
ing not only the leaders but the rank and file of the
Liberal party. Lord Rosebery has counseled separa
tion. In his recent addresses' he has advised the Lib
erals to "clean the slate" of Gladstone's Irish pro
gramme and to go forward to new issues. It is now
for the Liberals to decide whether to accept Rose-,
bery's leadership or t eject it and hold fast to the old
home rule platform,

The close of the oration is an utterance of clean philosophy: 'There is no one
but must feel his devotion to his country renewed and kindled when he remembers how,
McKinlcy loved, revered and served it, showed in his lilc how a citizen should live, and
in his last hour taught us how a gentleman could die."
It is evident that this address may well go into school readers to transmit lessons
of patriotism to the future. .', _Z__

did life which have come down from the past. They read in their weekly newspapers. the
story of the world's progress, in which they were eager to take part, and of. the sins and
wrongs of civilization with which they burned to do battle. It was a serious and
thoughtful time. The boys of that day felt dimly but deeply that days of sharp struggle
and high achievement were before them. They looked at life with the wondering yet
resolute eyes of a young esquire in his vigil of arms; They felt a time was doming when
to them should be addiessed the stern admonition of the Apostle: 'Quit you ltice men;

for b new trial.
The case of Edward Duncan, the re
maining defendant charged with Rice's
murder, was called, but Attorney Hutton
ack-'d for a continuance till Monday, as
he desired to file affidavits for a change of
venue. He considered the defendant
would not get a fair and impartial trial In
this city and county. The Judge con
tinued the case till Monday to enable
Hutton to file the affidavits.
The Judge, before discharging the Jury,
referred to their strong recommendation to
the mercy of the court ond said as it was
the last time he would have an opportun
ity to address them in regard to the case
it might bo proper to inform them that if
the court sustained the verdict they had
rendered it would be incumbent upon the
court to take into account in determining
the punishment the record of a prior con
viction against the defendant for robbery.
On the arraignment of the defendant this
prior conviction was formally confessed
by him. Under our system of laws a. Jury
was not permitted to know of a prior
conviction unless a defendant put it in
issue by a denial thereof. The court
deemed it appropriate to make the ex
planation to them in view of the fact that
as a Jury they had exhibited an Interest
in *.he question of the punishment of the
defendant and the court deemed it due to
them to make the explanation to them in
response to their suggestion.
The Jurors who tried the case were:
Abraham Blumenthal, Albert Meyer,
Joshua B. Pitch, James II. Doolittle, John
Nuenberg. Abraham L. PeyBer, Gustave

Dr. Somera' paper was an exhaustive
one. He has given the subject of crema
tion a close study and he favors It be
cause it is sanitary. He said the people
of the present day object to cremation
because it waa not the custom of their
forefathers. He argued that the tradi
tional mode of burial watt unsanitary and
therefore the people of this enlightened
ace should net an example for posterity.
The speaker Maid that burial was sup
posed to mean the last resting place of
th'j body. He says this was not the case
as the bodies had often been moved in
order that the living might use the ceme
tery as a place of abode. He pointed to
the fart that the tilte now* UHed aa tho
Ctty Hall was once a burial place, but
tho growth of the city made it necessary
to move thn bodies to the outskirts

to move the bodies Into another count*.

evening at Cooper Medical College on
"Cremation and Burial" the physician
said when he died he wanted hla earthly

A dispatch waa received yesterday by
United States District Attorney Wood-:
worth from the United States Attorney
General at Washington, In connection
with certain railroad cases that had been
pending in the United States Circuit
Court for many years. The history of
the cases as given by Dr. Wood worth is
as follows:
About eleven yearn ago two aulta la equity
were brought In the United State* Circuit
Court In this city by the United .States District
Attorney to cancel certain letters, contracts
and deeds mad* between the original railroad*
to which certain land grants were made and
by them to the Southern Pacific Company.
Under the administration of United States Dis
trict Attorney Henry a. Foote. AÂ»Â»liitant United
titatea District Attorney Knight recommended
the dismissal of the autts on the sround that
the Circuit Court had "no Jurisdiction and that
the suits should have been brought In Ken
tucky, the purported birthplace of the South
ern Pacific Comixiny. Thla recommendation,
which waa made to tha law department at
Washington. I>. C., wan overruled by Justice
Haiiun. who at the tlrrm waa acting for Chle(
Justice Field, and decided that th* Circuit
Court for the Northern Dtatrtct ot California
had Jurisdiction. Subsequently the Huprctr.i
Court of the United Htates decided in thÂ»
Oonaalea rase advÂ«riit>ly to the position of thÂ«
Government.
Continuing. Mr. Woodworth said:

attempt to preserve the identity of tho
California Club will not, be maintained.
', If thu club should go out of existence the
association will huvo only six members

Tli I'] annual mooting of tha California
Crlckot Association will be held at
tho , Occidental Hotel on Monday
ovening next.' Tho association has
'.. , â¢" * lost' its second vice .president, who
was one of the best-known cricketers in
the State. This Is Hubert U. lloguo, who
was for several seasons captain of the
Alameda Cricket Club and . one of the
I best supporters , of , cricket ' on the FucMc
Coast. When the Hunter Harrison chamÂ«
plonship cup wus ' won by the ' Alameda
Cricket Club for the, third time and so
becumu the absolute property of tho club,
it was presented to it. U. Iloguc. who
.took it with him to Australia on itm
occasion of his visit there a year or two
ago. It is not likely the' vacancy, left
by his departure will be nilcd by Ihe elec
tion . of ' another vice president; as tho as
sociation still has its' regular number of
fouf. ' . .
Leonard Chenery has been placed in
charge of the San Francisco team, but
has experienced considerable diniculty In
conducting negotiations with the Oak
landers. Vice Captain P. E. Bowles' busi
ness keeps him in Oakland, and Captuin
Orestes Pierce, who usually makes all ar
rangements for matche* on tiehalf of the
Oakland team, although he has an office
In this city, Is as elusive an a sunbeam.
The Ban Francisco men deslro to have a
team of ten players, who will probably
be chosen from thÂ« following: T. <;. Me-
Conkey, O. 11. Cookwy, C. J. Decker.
Lli'ini mint J. S. Oyster. W. E. Lester, J.
Ii. M<<-. ('uptalti IÂ». J. Rumbuuith, J.'-'in

The 8an - Francisco captain suggested
that no man be considered a class U man
who has piiiyi ii on a duns A team within
two years. If this principle bu adopted
the Oakland caiituln would be consider
ably restricted In his rholre. on the lant
three places on the Oakland team have
Â»>eÂ«n allod by Bovpral men at various
tlmeÂ«. It in likely the condition of eligi

not represented his club as a class A mun
for <>;â¢'â¢ year, or during the present season.
As tic* Oakland team, has oeen picked to

be impossible, to play to-day.
Thn heavy fain of the lust few days has
prevented the competition for the Coun
rll's cup for ladles of the Ban' Francisco
(Jolf Club being finished. The scml-flnal
round should have been played on Friday,
February 21, nnd tho final round on'Mon
day, February 24, but there was rfo play
on either of these two days. The semi
final n>unÂ«l. however, has only one match,
the third contestant having drawn a bye,
no it can be .played on any morning when
the two fair competitors agrÂ£e. when It
is finished the final round can be decided
in the same way. As next week is entire
ly open on the schedule of the ladles' an
nex the contest should be concluded be
fore the end of that period. On Monday,
held. The event in question is the
first of a series of homc-and-home games
between teams representing class D of the
San Francisco and the Oakland golf
c!ubs. Tho Oaklanders having won the
match last year, the opening match

TWO incomplete tennis tournament*
will be finished to-day, and to-mor
row at the California Club's courts.
Th* class singles tournament com
menced last Saturday on the courts of
th* Coquellcot Tennis Club In Oakland"
win also be completed to-day If possible.
In the California Club tournament play
was, completed down to tha semi-finals,
the four remaining 1 in are: W. B. Collier
and Fred Brown of the first class, Sidney
Salisbury of th* second and Herbert
Schmidt of th* third class. Collier will
allow Salisbury odds of " flfte . en ' ank wn "?
the odds conceded by Brown to Schmidt
will be "half thirty/ Collier and Brown
will probably com* together in the final.
These two men have met twice In the last
few months and each 1Â» credited with a
victory. Brown almost made It two
straight, but after hÂ»vlnÂ« the match
within a point several times nnally lost.
Schmidt and Salisbury both played bet
ter than usual on Saturday and unlesn
they eo to pieces will cut quite a figure in
their matches. Many pick Schmidt to win
th* tournament, as he has shown steady
Improvement of late.
Tho Oakland tournament, owing to the
exceedingly largo entry list, Is not so near
completion as is the event on this side of
the bay. In the championship class Reu
ben Hunt and George IJuker. two cracks
from the University of California, will
play in the final. Hunt iÂ» expected to win.
out if Baker ha* improved much in the
pant year ho will make his opponent work
hard to do so.
In the first class the four men left to
contend for class honors are: C II. Oor
rill. William T. Frost, W. Cooper and W.
A. Haloy. Frost is a strong favorite in
this class. â¢ .
In thn second class K. M. Otis and Rrud
ford Webster will play In tha final. In
tha third chins the two men to reach the
final were 8. Hawlcy and C. Delancey.
Some Bood matches will result from tho
Interclaas play-off.
The Polytechnic High School's doubles
try-out will bo completed this mornlnst on
the California Club courts. Tho Oeary
brothers will play Horace Mann and Sum
Llllcnthal in the Heml-tlnata. The winncrct
will play Marsh and Murtin In tho final.
The Oeary brothers earned quite a reputa
tion in Seattle and are strong favorite*
for first honors. Horace Mann won tha
singles try-out and will represent hla
school. Hla defeat of "Bill" Geary was a

WHEN the University of California athletic team starts eastward in April to measure the strength and. the speed of its members >vith the crack' sprinters and field athletes of the East the hopes of its admirers will center*
chiefly about Anthony Cadogan nnd Alfred Plaw. These two wearers of the blue and gold are expected to hold their own -in any \ company. ' There is reason for. the confidence of their admirers, as each man has
proved his .mettle in the sharpest competition. Cadogan is a sure lo-sccond man in the i bo-yard 1 dash. He has covered the"distance in even time on three occasions and * on different cinder paths. He accomplished
jhc feat first at the University of California-Stanford field day, held on Berkeley oval; last April. .On May. 6 he repeated the performance at 'the, University of Oregon-California meet held at Eugene, Oregon. Four
days later. he accomplished the feat at Seattle when.the California team met tlie 'representatives of the University of Washington. At Yale,' oii May 5, 1900, he defeated Richards in 10 1-5 seconds. On June 2, at Chicago, he won the
"hundred" in 10 1-5 and the 220-yard dash in 22 2^5. Cadogan has filled out. considerably' during tlie' winter, and, gives promise ,of!better^ work during the coming season. He has a clever team mate in Brown, who has shown
well in the sprints, Plaw, the youthful Hercules, has steadily improved under the tuition of Tom CarrolK n ninstir-liaml at weight throwing, until 'there 1 is no telling whntimnrk he will ultimately set. In practice recently he sent
the 16-pound hammer a distance of 187 feet 4 inches. The American record is 171 feet 9 'inchesjielcl by John l ? lanagan. There are other goodmen on the team, including R.R. Service, the speedy "milcr"; II. C. Check, the
hurdler; Ed Hussey, the jumper and sprinter, who captains the team, and W. A. .Powell, a good a11-aroiin ( d r majv, but particularly stfong^overthe hurdles.

fay Wood*, thÂ« favorite finished eecond
in front of Loyal B, beaten nvÂ« lengths.
Vt>r the fourth con*ecutlva day Phil
Archibald turned up a> ftarter, and thÂ«
big gelding captured the seven-furlonfc
run in a hard drive from Legal Maxim.
He closed a Â« to 6 favorite, ahd, after cut*
ling out the pace, won by a neck. Es
lado received etcady eupport at 3, but
was carried wide In tho stretch by the
winner, finishing third.
Foul Play, which scored on Thursday
et odds of 20 to 1, repeated her perform
ance in the third event, only on this nccaÂ»
elon she ruled a 7 to 5 favorite. Prior
epaln rode the mare and she led from
*tart to finish. El Rey. with O'Connor In
the saddle, proved a. dangerous contender
through the stretch, losing by a length
only. Ural took the show.
J. Ransch on Flamero. the 9 to 10 ra
vorite lor the Blx and a half furlong sell

the going, with a consequence that he
was beaten with ease' by Qulz^II. Lee
Jackson rode the winner and made a run
away race of It. Hard ridden by Hoar,
Merops landed In third position.
Bragg, with Ransch and 95 pound* In
the. saddle, clearly outgamed Dunblane
through the stretch In the second seven
furlong run. The latter horse was In
stalled favorite, and, piloted by O'Connor,
looked very much like "the merchandise."
Ransrh thaved all the corners good and
close with Bragg, and when it came to a
long drive the three-year-old possessed
the most Btamlna, deposing of O'Connor'*
mount by two lengths, Botany, the Â«ec

In lino with Its decision annulling. tho

clnred Invalid certain provisions In 1 the

A. Pratt, offlclal reporter of I, the Ru
pcrlor Court of Ventura County,' brought
suit to compel A. W. Drowne.v. County
Auditor, to audit his silary warmntHfor
tho months from Janunry, 1900^ to-, ftfttrch.
1901, lnÂ«;luÂ»lve, under Â«.' section of tno.ttct
which llxwi tho snlarlcs -of 'County rtlMcvrs^
The soctlon, provides that In ; -counties of
the third class tho omclal reporter shall
receive a sulary of 1100 per month.
Tho Auditor claimed thnt tho provision
was unconstitutional In that the. subject
was not oppressed In . tho title, and sec
ondly that such legislation was special
and local. ,,. .
The codes were dcclnrcd Invalid be
cause the subjects of the various laws
wero'not expressed In their titles and tho
ttamo course of reasoning Is applied to the
CH5O at bur. In considering the second
elulm, the court admits tho power of the
Legislature to classify counties for thn
purpose of regulating tho compensations
of olTlcers. An ofndul reporter Is held,
however, not to be an ofllccr primarily.
Tho law In specifying the clnss of- tho
county Is hold to make tho provision local
and special.
Tho court therefore sustains the Auditor
In his refusal to audit Pratt's warrants.
Pratt loses tho amount of his claim,
which Is for flGOft.

Ffre Chief Sullivan was" called to the
stand at the opening of the morning ses
sion and testlited that the Spring.Val
ley Water Company had persistently, < re
fused to Install new hydrants pending tho
determination of Its suit. The number of
lire hydrants In uso Is 3771. and 500 more
are needed to Insure adequate/lire protec
tion. The cost of hydrants Is $80 and, tho
expense Is met by the city.' Â¦ '
1 J. ;\V. McCarthy, secretury of ' the ' Fire
Commission, said that tho company .was
tequestpd to put In 49S hydrants last year,
but none were supplied;. .All letters of
the witness to the water company relative
to the installation of hydrants were Ig
nored. - .'-â¢â¢, â¢ ,
. Engineer Schussler, on taking the stand,
paid tho company refused to put In hy
drants unless Â¦â¢' adequate' compensation
wero ' allowed. Then, speaking. of water
mains, Schusaler said - that tlvo - and a
quarter, miles of additional mains were 1
laid' for the ratepayers, but not for the
tire service. ' ', . â¢
. "What wlll.be needed for an adequate
fire protection this year?" Inquired Braun
hart. Â¦ â¢ â¢Â¦â¢Â¦... ' â¢:Â¦ â¢ Â¦â¢Â¦.-Â¦
"I don't. know," was the-reply.'
"If you were allowed 5-per cent Inter
est on $500,000 for new mains would that
be satisfactory?" . ' ,.Â¦
"No, sir. We have to care for the needs
of cltle3 in outside counties,, -\nd we need
the interest on all our properties as well
as on the. extension or our -distributing
system." ' . Â¦ . ...
"We â¢ want more . hydrants," persisted
Braunhart. /;'.â¢â¢- ..
."Give us a fair rate, remarked Attor
ney Kellogg.' "and we will cover 'you up
with hydrants." â¢ ,
Schussler remarked that the city had
never done Its duty to .' the - water com
pany, â¢ that corporation being one of the
heaviest taxpayers. The company spent
$2,000,000 In enlarging its mains and proper
interest for that outlay was, not allowed.
.Later iSchus3ler announced that' he had
Refused to Set Hydrants.
The Â¦ Board of Supervisors ] failed ! to
agree on the ordinance fixing water rates
at their meeting last night,', and
it is .certain that the report of the water
committee, which* was presented at mid
night, will be passed to print' by ;the
board next Monday, there 'is a minority
of six who will oppose it with vehemence.
When the" board convened Chairman
Connor of the water 'committee' was
asked if he had a report to offer. He re
plied in the negative and added that
Comte would file a report. This' the lat
ter did, the document . bearing Boxton's
name besides his own. Connor, declined to
concur In the report.
, According to the^ majority report the
value of the water 'company's property is
placed at $25,70U,7UO, and allowing rtve per
cent interest . on tnis sum the- income
would reach $l,ja>!),53ti 14. .The sum- of
Mtrt.OvO was allowed for ' ex
penses and $210,755 tor taxes,' making a
total revenue or *l,9tf7.201 14.
The report recommended'that.the.cur
rent domestic rates be maintained with
out change, and that $12v,00U, be'pald tor
tire hydrants at the rate . of ' $2 50 â¢ per
hydrant. This virtually increases the
revenue of the water- company," --as' the
sum allowed for hydrants", last/ year was
180,000. . Â¦ Â¦;â¢:â¢ ~ .. : â¢
tjrandcnsteln moved that.the:consider
ation of tne report be deferred'Untlt Mon
aay next. As it was evident the; minority
wanted lime in which to make- its- case,
the matter went over without action. until
the date mentioned.. ; - .-- â¢ 'â¢
, While in caucus the minority, consist
ing of Messrs. Braunhart, Curtis, Wynn,
Loughery and Booth, insisted upon a 5
per cent reduction of domestic rates, to
consumers and a further reduction of the
rate of (2 CO a month for hydrants to $2
a month. These matters coming to a
vote were lost, there belng'a majority. of
eleven in faVor-of the reportas present
ed by Comte. These are Alpers, . Bent,
Brandenstein, Comte, 1/Ancona, .Eggers,

It . waa dealing honestly with the peo
ple and municipal authorities, and was
therefore entitled to fair treatment at
the hands of the board. In fixing a Ju.u
valuation upon the . company's property
care should be taken to lnqulro what
corresponding property 'cfswhert" Is value i
at. All of the property of Spring Valley
had been acquired . from individual own
ers, but the fact that these propcrttra
were unified did not imply that the values
â¢of the individual holdings were lessened
on that account. On the contrary they
increased materially. For the reasons
given In his testimony Schussler ask. U
that no reduction of rate* be made.
Attorney Kellogg asked that the sched
ule of 1900 be allowed, with tho exception
that the hydrant rate be fixed at J5. Even
with .this the dividends of the company
will bo Insufficient. Capital has the right
to demand more than -a per cent Interest
on its Investments. Were this Increase
allowed it would mean little to the people
but much, to the company. It wouid in
crease the people's bills 36 cents a year,
and give the company an opportunity of
bettering Its service fully 50 per cent.' The
people of San Francisco were satisfied
with the water service, and no one ever
complained of excessive charges. To re
duce the revenue of the company la sim
ply to impair the efficiency of the ser

why do it? All the company wanted was

"We have not," replied' Attorney Kel
logg. ."I .would earnestly request the
board to â¢ rescind that part of its resolu
tion, as the contract has absolutely noth
ing to do with this inquiry."
The matter was not "pressed and the In
quiry was resumed. Schussler presented
three- analyses of water furnished by Pro
fessor Hilgard. These showed that the
water was good. Tests of the Alameda
Creek' water, made by Professor Mauser,
tended to show that it contained no dis
ease germs.
Braunhart said there was no question
In his mind that the water supplied to
this' community was as pure as can be
furnished.
Schussler went on to say that the Im
pression* prevails in the East that the
people cf San Francisco are being slowly
poisoned by water supplied by the Spring
Valley Water Company. In order that
the people might learn the truth he filed
the analyses alluded, to. Then, on being
asked to make a final statement to the
board, he said hlÂ« company owned an ex
cellent system, which was operated on
practical lines. . .
City Engineer Grunsky .was called and
explained at length his appraisement of
the Spring Valley Company's properties.
He informed the board that he was un
able to appraise the properties of the Sub
urban Water Company.
Russell IX Dunn of the Vl3ltaclon Water
Company testified that his company was
furnishing 150,000 gallons daily and that
its , mains measured fifteen miles. The
capacity of tne plant is 300,000 gallons
daily and its receipts last year exceeded
$WKW. .
i Braunhart inquired if the Spring Valley
Company had complied With the request
of the board and furnished the contract
between that corporation and the Subur
ban Water Company relative to the trans
fer- of- properties a few days since.
Secretary Ames presented figures show
ing the revenues of the company for the
current fiscal year, which would aggre
gate $1,853.8*0. Of that sum $13,046 repre
sented rents. The surplus on July 1,

and as a result he was prepared to make
the offer that during the next fiscal year
he would put in from 100 to 2*) hydrants.
This offer was made, however, without
prejudice to the company's suit.
"What about the needs of tho Univer
sity Mound district?" asked Conner.
â¢ "I wifl investigate the matter and see
what can be done," replied Schussler.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FAIL TO AGREE ON WATER RATES
no one. this can be accomplished and the
company earnestly requested that that
course be followed.
The committee reported progress and
retired to consider the evidence. On Its
return the board reassembled, and the re
port recommending the rates as stated
was presented. The board then ad

FINAL VICTORY
In response to an inquiry madeby the
Government as to the fate of an escort
of convoy of empty wagons, which, ac
cording to a dispatch from Lord Kitch
ener, tr.arie public February 2Â«5. was at
tacked and captured by ttto BoeTs south
west of Kleerksdorp, Transvaal Colony,
February 24, Lord Kitchener has cabled
thÂ«Â» following mescagc:
"A report has just been received that
sixteen officers and 451 men were taken
prifeoners. Of these one officer and 105
men have been released. Colonel Ander
son of the Imperial Yeomanry, who com
manded, is still a prisoner. Major Ender
by, who commanded the infantry, was
wounded. Hence th#> delay in obtaining
definite Information."
A dispatch received to-night from Har
rismith shows that General Dewet and
Btcyn were within the net described by
ix.Td Kitchener in his dispatch from Har
rismith concerning the killing or captur
ing of 600 Boers during the last two days,
but escaped before the line was completed.
To-night's dispatch from Harrismlth
also says that Colonel Rawllns scored the
biggest success of the drive. He succeed
ed in completely surrounding a laager of
400 Boers and gave them one hour in
Â¦which to decide whether they would sur
render or flght._^ The Boere. nnding es
cape Impossible, surrendered at discre
tion- and not a shot was fired.
The censorship in South Africa has
been excessively strict for some time pa&t
end dispatches have consequently suffer
ed eerlous. delay. In some cases they
have been held up for one or two days
huh at Cape Town and Pretoria.
CENSORSHIP IS STRICT.
Lord Kitchener says nothing in his re
ew nse about the two guns that the Boers
captured with the convoy, and Brodrick,
the Secretary of State for War. an
nounced in the House of Commons to-day
that the Government had no further in
formation beyond that communicated in
Lord Kitchener's dispatcti.
War Secretary Brodrick, replying to a
question In the House of Commons to
day, said no details, with the exception
of "the list of casualties, had been received
of the recent capture of a British convoy
of empty wagons near Kleerksdorp. ICo
men i had been reported killed, but there
were about 100 wounded.
RECENT BRITISH REVERSE.
"The fighting was at close quarters and
the Boers, as usual, drove a large herd
of cattle in front of them. Manic Botha,
the Boer leader, was killed and thlrty-flve

Over 100 horses were killed and GOjO head

This news was so welcome to the Brit

Common* by War Secretary Brodrlck,
from a dispatch of Lord Kitchener, a*
"lolluwc:
KITCHENER'S REPORT,
LONDON. Feb. :8.â Following the pre
cedent of Lord Roberts, who announced
General Cronje's surrender at Paardeburg
on the anniversary of the battle of Ma
.u.i..-. 11111 (February Â£7. 1SS1), Lord Kitch
ener apparently selected tho'aamo anni
vmary to achieve a big success, by a.
Â« omblntd movement, lavttng two days,

PITTSBURG. Feb." . 28.â Pittsburg and
vicinity is to-nlrht threatened with a dis
astrous, flood. The great ice gorge in the
Allegheny, passed, out to-day without do
ing any serious damage, but the great
volume of water behind it,' which is being
augmented every moment by swollen
creeks . and mountain streams, ( makes | !t
apparent that much damage must result
before the waters 'Â¦ subside. At 10:30
o'clock to-night Government Forecaster
Rldgoway issued ,a bulletin, stating that
tho rivers had reached the danger point
andiwere rising fast.' He sent; out warn
ings to all river men.'raliroad'.companles
and all interested to' prepare for. at least
twentyiflve fÂ«iet by morning.- Rnd predict,
od a. maximum of thirty feet.. All resi
dents, of downtown districts have moved
to second floor*. Tho Lincoln and Boycr
hotelo and the Y. M. C. A. to-day vacated
the stround floor* of being
flooded, to-morrow. .. - '. ';Â¦' â¢"'
The rain storms of last: night have
caused serious interruptions to this route.
South of Washington is to-day practically
cut off and the interior of Pennsylvania
is in a similar condition. In Ohio the ram
storms have also hampered telegraph' ser
vice seriously. Torrential rains. ; reported
to be of almost cloudburst severity, have
occurred in the South Atlantic States. Mis
sissippi and Alabama and that region is
to-day practically without communica
tion. Severe thunderstorms have accom
panied the rainfall. .In many sections
rivers arc out of their .banks and caused
not only derangement of -wires, but much
interruption of railway traffic: .
The' storm gave a generous share of Us
attention to New York: City. During this
afternoon for a short time. the rain fell
in torrents and the wind blew at the rate
of sixty-eight miles an' hour. "The storm
made the waters on the bay. very rousrh,
and interfered greatly with shipping. The
cruiser San Francisco* weighed anchor at
â¢noon under* sealed orders, for sea, but
when. she reached a point off Swinburne
Island her captain changod her course
and returned to the anchorage grounds
off ' Tompkinsvllle, â¢ on account of the
storm. The Cincinnati and Olympia were
prepared to get-under way should their
anchors fail to hold fast. *, ,
From New. Jersey points reports of flood
and damage are coming in. , Trains are de
layed or held up. altogether, on the L.e
high and Pennsylvania railroads. Bridges
are^.beins washed- away and farms are
under water. The Delaware River is out
of its banks at Flemlngton, and at River
side the rails of the South' Branch Rail
road are eighteen inches under watef. The
Black Diamond express on â¢ the Lehlgh
Valley road went as far as' Mauch Chunk
and from there was obliged to return to
New York. â¢ Â¦ '.- . â¢ "

No trulna have passed through on the
Seaboard north for Atlanta In twenty
i four hours. Washouts are reported on
i all railroads coming Into Atlanta to-night
L except two. The railroads are handling
f their passenger tramu only with the
greatest dltllculty. No train on the Sea
; board Air Line has reached this city
; since Thursday morning until 6:30 tlm
! afternoon. All trains on this road are
turned -back at -Athens, Ga., . using the
Southern's tracks into Atlanta. Tho first
train over the Southern from Washington
since 10 o'clock last nieht pulled into the
Atlanta depot at 6 o'clock to-night. , â¢
A negro woman was killed, another
fatally injured and several negro men
badly hurt- by a cyclone -which passed
over Dawson, Ga., late last night. Hen
ley's roller mills, the Barnett mills and
Klnnard'a sawmill were washed away,
near Jackson, Ga., by the flood. The rail
road tracks near Jackson are reported
live feet under water. Â»â¢-'â¢â¢â¢ â¢'â¢ >; : â¢. /
NEW YORK, Feb.Â«28.â While' the, tele
graph companies are still' struggling to
repair the damages resulting from the
sleet and gales of last week, ; they are
now facing an additional derangement of
their systems because of heavy rain
storms in the Middle West and the riouth.
It is said that the Interruption of tele
graphic communication, has never before
been so general or so long continued.
In the vicinity of Philadelphia,- where
the storm of last Friday was most severe,
the companies are still endeavoring to re
store their wires, but the damage was so
exteusive that the work is not yet com
pleted and practically business for Balti
more, -Washington and the South Is still
being routed by way of Pittsburg and the
West. â¢

There are two conflicting forces in the Egg
market at present. One consists of those deal
ers who are content to follow the market down,
letting it fall of Its own weignt: the other con
sists of a number of large houses who want to
make a yuick job of the decline, and by forcing
the market down get it as soon as possible to
a point where they can put the goods Into cold
storage and thus clear, the decks and Improve
the rltuatlon. They argue that the market has
got to drop to that point In two or three days
at furthest, and the sooner the job Is done the
better it will lie for the market. These dealers
yesterday offered to sell any quantity from 100
cases down at 14@15c. The other dealers wero
asking 15(fj 17c . for i ranch, though sales above
3 tic were few, and close buyers were not dis
posed to "pay even 16c except for small lots.
Unless another stormy- period sets In the de
cline ia likely to continue for several days- yet.-
The Kxchange made another reduction, quot
ing 14c for gathered and 14Â®15c for ranch.
Everybody Is complaining about the sudden
large increase in the supply of Eggs, which
has demoralized ' the market. There are large
pilea in the Â¦ commission houses, and they are
steadily growing.' Quotations wired to the
north are turneU down, replies such -as "2c too
high," "lc too high, "^ . etc.," being
The local demand ia utterly inadequate to ab
sorb the current .receipts, hence stock3 are ac
cumulating and prices are declining.
Butter continues scarce and firm, most deal
ers being cleaned up. With settled weather
stocks will undoubtedly increase, hence deal
ers, aa already mentioned, are indisposed to
'advance quotations. There is nothing new in

fair coal for stove us>es: Steam grades axe
moving off freely, considering thf quantity of
fuel oil being consumed by three-fourths of all
the factories in the city and around the bay.
The gas companies are dropping bituminous
coals entirely out of their methods for light
producing, using anthracite only, with oil a4
an adjunct.. They find the latter the most im
proved and economical method. Freights from
Australia and England on coal still remain
low. which proves that freights all' over the

to ask him to go with them to take the

Mains', partner, "W. Scott Gifford. was
arrested yesterday morning at Pacific
Grove, Monterey County, by Deputy Unit
ed States Marshal Gambles, Gifford was
employed at Pacific Grove as a telegraph
operator by the Southern Pacific Com
pany and everybody in the village knew
nim by that name, but the authorities did
not learn of his whereabouts until Friday
of last week, when the city editor of a
morning newspaper informed them of the
fact. As Gifford's name might have been
used by ilalns without his knowledge,
the United States Marshal requested Gif-'
ford's employer to obtain from him the
name of some friend in San Francisco to
whom, he could be sent in case of acci
dent. Gifford named Charles R. Mains,
3132 Twenty-fifth street, and said that his
mother was living with Mr. and Mrs.
Mains.
Gifford was accompanied by his mother
to the United States Marshal's office yes
terday. There ho wept and blubbered un
til his eyes were red and sore. He said
that he had been' acquainted - with Malna
about seven yearsâ six years in "Michigan
and one year in this city. Gifford arrived
here last May. He said that Mains spoke
to him of the four bllllon-dollar syndicate
and Induced him to accept the position
of actuary without salary. He did not
think that four billions of capitalization
was an extravagant sum. he said, be
cause he knew that nearly all corpora
tions have larger capital on paper than
In the safe. He said further that while
he was eating In a restaurant In this city
last AuKuat Mains came In and intro
duced him to Dr. Charles E. Bennett of
Wausseon, Ohio, and had a ten minutes'
talk with Bennett on thÂ« subiect of Mains'
oil.' stocks, bonds, railroad and realty
syndicate.- Last January Gifford signed
his name as actuary to the contract be
tween Bennett and the Imaginary syndi
cate, whereby Bennett, in consideration of
,the sum of KOOO to bo paid by him, was
to be made president of the syndicate nt
a 'salary of $5000 for the first year. J1000
being in cash and $-1000 in stock.
"But' through all these transactions Gif
ford did not know that the corporations
mentioned were purely imaginary, and be
lieved that Mains was engaged In a legiti
mate enterprise, he said.
As Gifford seemed to be something of a
fool with an aged mother depending upon
him for support. United States District
Attorney Woodworth and Assistant Unit
ed States Attorney Banning .decided to
use Gifford as a Government witness and
to release him upon hl3 own recognizance
Mains then argued a motion to quash
the Indictment, and the. motion was taken
under advisement. Asslsant United States
Attorney E. J. Banning will tile- authori
ties on behalf of the Government.
Charles R.' Mains, lato of >Iichigah and.
promoter of a syndicate of Imaginary
firms .with an aggregate capital of. four
billion dollars, spent two hours In the
United States District Court yesterday
morning in a futile effort to convince
Judge de Haven that he was entitled to a
writ of habeas corpus, . because of his
allegation that the Grand Jury had no
evidence on which to found the indictment
against him other than certain letteVs
written by him and the testimony of a
Postofflce Inspector who spoke only front
hearsay. Mains, when not engaged in
fishing for gulls with a four million bait,
is a lawyer, but he was not well versed
on the law of. habeas corpus, for Judge
de Haven denied the application.

ary of the Syndicate,

on Thursday, but he â¢was*, far fronTbelng

A ' conference was . held- , ; yesterday . by
Rev. Drs. F. D. Bovard, J. N. Beard. F. 1 K.
Baker and H. F.' Briggs, In the 'office of
Attorney Monroe. , The four clergymen
hadibeendeeply moved by the publication
in The Call of the story of -how. Rev. , Mr.'
Simonds had sold- his .property .'and-i was
alleged to be ill-treated by Mrs. Helene
Hartwigrsen, the ! woman who bought. 1 the
property; and who had been. paid. by the
aged minister. to take care of him.
This, morning a petition will. be filed in
the Superior Court by. Attorney; H. E.
-Monroe, acting for Rev. Dr. H. F. Briggs,
asking that the latter gentleman be ap
pointed guardian for Rev. Mr. Simonds.
Jose, and Mrs. Gillette of Los Gatos'are

arid Mrs. S.. L. McCarthy of Los Angeles

Thft old gentleman had an ido^' th.it he was
possessed of mining stock that was worth mil
lions, but we Â¦ investigated and found It was
worthless. He had a house full of furniture
and â¢ I Fhould ? Judge i that the lot. with the
house and contents, -was fully worth (5000 or
$0000. I am grateful to The Call for Inves
tigating this. matter, though it i<Â» a -reat shook
to me to Bee this publicity. I have- tele
graphed to MrÂ». Fielding to come here; for
she Is- better acquainted with Â¦ Mr. Slmonds'
affairs than I am. I**
I usually saw. Mr.- Slmonds tvo fin a thjve
times a month, -whenever I had a chance to call
at his house. About b\x months ago I taw
nun for the last time. .- In the last half year
whenever r called at'tho house I was told that
uncle was "either our: for a walk or in bed
asleep. I always ' Inquired how he , was. , and
Mrs. Hartwigsen assured me that -he was well
and happy. If at any time she was unable tn
attend to him all she had to do was to tele
phone me. .." ,
Knew Address of Niece.
She knew my address and telephone number
Sho was not an invalid up to the time I taw
my uncle last. I never had the slightest eua-
J>!cion that he was not being well treated or
that there was anything wrong aa to his finan
cial affairs. . â¢
The Rev. F. K. Baker -was also seen
last evening and made a similar state
ment, i Â¦

relatives havÂ«Â» thought for many years that he
was mentally incompetent. When his w!ft wÂ«
alive sho looked after his business afTa rs and
his personal comfort. After she died In ilSM
ho had a woman in the house who atterJAl
S m ," J ' r *OÂ»ently visited htm after h wife

and said the was Mrs. Hartwigsen. She
wanted 'me to use my influence with Mr Sl
monds and helpTicr to buy his property' As
she was a stranger to me I refused to do so
L was u s " r PrH$ed shortly afterward to learn
tnat-she had- bought the home and was living
in the house. Sho told my sister. Mrs Fluld-
Ing. that oho had given our undo $2000 and
had agreed to look after, him for the rest of hU
