The excursion to Mount Tamalpais was
attended by more than 300 Shriners and
their ladies. The party had a fair, view
of the bay, but the fog that rose and

the more distant points from view. The
novelty of the trip was enjoyed by -all,
however, and despite the drawback of
the fog It was heartily enjoyed. The ex
cursion to Berkeley was not so success
ful. Owing to some misunderstanding as
to dates only thirty-five pilgrims went
to the university town at the scheduled
time. The result was a bitter disappoint
ment to the officials of Berkeley, who had
provided many equipages for the accom
modation of the expected visitors. The
vehicles were not required, nor were the
cervices of the school children, who were
to etrew the pathway of the pilgrims

a. galling experience for the Berkeley
people, but as there Is no one against
whom the responsibility can . be lodged

The grounds of the decision are that
the plaintiff could not resign an office to
Â¦which he had not then been appointed or

Mrs. Nierhoff was away from home at
the time of the shooting, and her daugh

young lady's side of the story has not
yet been heard. Dr. Todd, who Is attend

there was no chance for the wounded
man's recovery.

Glover claims that the rancher advanced
upon him with a club and that he fired
to save himself. In his ante-mortem
statement, Nierhoff declares that he did
not have a club; that the shooting was
coldblooded, and that Glover visited the
ranch with the Intention of taking his
life.
Glover was courting the daughter of thfe
rancner. The old gentleman objected and
warned the visitor not to visit his place.
Glover went to the ranch this afternoon,
carrying a rifle of large caliber. The ac
counts given by the two principals of
what occurred in the tragedy that follow

hoft received the bullet as he emerged
from his barn, the ball entering his right
side and coming out at the back.

tragedy occurred at the latter's ranch,
near Auburn. Nierhoff is not expected to
survive the night. Glover occupies a cell

Speaking of the showers of ashes that
are reported in the explosions at Kilauea
last Sunday, Professor Lyons says that
was quite unusual. He says that Kilauea
has welled up with lava.
The moon is new at this time, and Prc
fessor Lyons would not be surprised to
hear that by July 4 or thereabouts there
was considerable activity in the Hawaiian
volcanoes. The . first eruption of Mount
Pelee took place about the time the new
moon was showing, and again an erup
tion took place when the moon was at the
full.
EXPECTS GBEAT ACTIVITY.
Professor Curtis J. Lyons of Honolulu
predicts volcanic disturbances on. the Isl
ands. In an interview he points to the
coincidence that at the present time the
atmospheric conditions are practically in
keeping with volcanic disturbances, and
that the same causes which produce the
sultry weather on the islands produce
such eruptions. The moon and sun are
just now overhead.
Along the eastern coast of Hawaii and
seventy-five miles from Kilauea earth
quakes were experienced on May 31. and
again during the latter part of the week.
Buildings were shaken by the shocks but
no serious damage was done.
The Aorangi brought news of a volcanic
eruption farther south. From Fiji news
was received of an earthquake and vol
canic disturbance at Mount Lautoka on
April 30. The vibrations ; were felt for
several seconds, traveling from north to
south. No serious damage resulted. . .
SERIES OF EARTHQUAKES. *
At Kilauea just prior to the departure
of the^ steamer for Honolulu the liauna
Loa\r purser received a further message
from MaWer Waldron announcing that
the ivolcanbo was still, spouting forth

that an earlyi outbreak on a large scale
was expected. A : ' \ .- Â¦

night of-May 23-21.' Several visitors ar

saw them quite plainly. - ' .

lit was at 9 o'clock in the morning that
the 'first eruption was noticed, and
Kilauea then sent up clouds of red ashes,
sulphur and smoke. The second explosion
followed at noon and was similar to the
first. Neither caused any. damage, but
the. natives living in the vicinity of the
volcano were greatly excited and a more
serious outbreak .was t'eared". Purser
Simerson of the Mauna Loa reported that
smoke and steam were still arising in
grta't volumes, and it was the belief in
Honolulu that the volcano would soon be
throwing up larger clouds of volcanic
matter..

Mauna. L <qa, which had arrived at ixono

One movement in particular Is being
figured on. This is a concentration of
the forces of the retail grocers in one or
ganization to meet the question of the
proposed raising of the liquor license. The
Retail Grocers' Association has now
nearly 500 members, but as there are 1400
grocers in the city, this leaves in the
neighborhood of 900 retail dealers who
have not allied themselves with their fel
lows. It is expected to have a member
chip of at least 1000 before election time,
and a mass meeting of retail grocers la to
be held on Wednesday, June 25, when
steps will be taken to have each grocer in
the association take up the work of se
cuiing the co-operation of his neighbors.

notified the executors; that she would
waive all claims against the Fargo es
tate upon the receipt of $9000.
Fargo in his will bequeathed $80,000 to
Edward Fargo, a son of Miss Dutrit.
Fargo died two years ago, leaving an
estate Valued at $380,000 to his nieces and
grandnieces. His most intimate friends
had never heard that he had been mar
ried, and consequently they were great
ly surprised when former Judge A. A.
Sanderson came forward and announced
himself as the legal representative of
Jennie Dutrit of Paris and prepared to
commence an action to secure a widow's
share of the estate. Miss Dutrit claimed
that she had been married to Dutrit in
1872 at Gretna Qreen, Scotland.
A. A. Sanderson, attorney for Miss Jen
nie Dutrit of Paris, will present a peti
tion next Friday asking for leave to com
promise the claim against the estate of
the late Calvin F. Fargo, whose widow
she claims to be. Mis* Dutrit has con
sented to withdraw her claim against the
estate of the late liquor dealer upon the
payment to her of $9000.
WILL WITHDRAW
WIDOW'S CLAIM
The pursuers had not retreated far when
a shot was sent at them from the direc
tion of the barricade. The plan of the fu
gitives was now apparent. They wished
to tempt their pursuers to a disastrous at
tack. The position of the criminals was
such as to give them command of the lane
in the hollow and each member of the
posse could have been picked off without
a show of resistance. - "~
FIRE AT THE POSSE.
: A halt : was called, but David Sullivan
and a number of others In the posse
wished to* continue. The pursuit had so
excited them that "they became careless.
Durbin commanded that all return, say
ing that It was useless to proceed and
sacrifice good lives for j those of the
"scrubs" in hiding. After a protest the
posse consented. . - Â¦
A carefully planned ambuscade was
prepared by Tracy and Merrill this after
noon, which the pursuing posse narrowly
escaped. Six shots were exchanged be
tween the outlaws and the officers. There
were no casualties. Â¦'-.-â¢Â¦
Merrill and Tracy were discovered in a
wheat field at 3 o'clock by Benjamin Fish
er, a Salem youth, -who : was with the
militiamen from Woodbum. The tugitives
saw the guards at the same time and
concealed themselves. Fisher would have
fired, but was prevented by the militia.
"Word was sent to Sheriff Durbin, who
was with Guard Carson and the blood
hounds in another direction. The dogs
were quickly placed in the field, where a
search began for the scent. The animals
ran back and forth along the fence until,
passing out tha other side, they struck a
warm trail and followed it rapidly. The
trail led the pursuers into a shady lane
which suddenly dipped into a gully.
Before descending Carson glanced on
the other side, through the tree branches,
and saw a natural barricade of stones
across the path. Fearing an ambuscade,
he talked with Durbin, who entertained
a similar premonition. *=i>.->B.o:--:- -

without ready
We will loan you the money for a regular banking
: - rate of intereit â six per cent And you can pay txs
back little by little in unfelt amounts Then you can
go to one of the first-class furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
â¢ big and fresh. and where satisfaction is certain, and
when you have made your selection you can pay 'your
bill in full with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
and being compelled to select your goods from smaller
and inferior stocks?
The installment stores charge you ten per cent
above their cash prices when you. ask for long credit
All you pay us is six per cent.
For example: If your purchases amount to $10000
we will charge you $106.00â which is a six per cent
advance; then you pay us $20.00 cash and the balance
in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month
If your purchases amount to $75-Oo we will charge you
$79.50; you make us a cash payment on this of $1500
and pay the balance at the easy rate of $6.45 p er

TORNADO PASSES OVER-TWO STATES
The orator of the day was General Hor
ace Porter, Embassador to France. He
reviewed the interesting history of the
academy, and spoke eloquently of the
great names associated with it. In con
cluding he counseled the graduates to
maintain a steadfast devotion to the
country.
Secretary of "War Root delivered a
short address. - *
At the banquet in thÂ© evening the toast
master was Judge Advocate General G.
B. Davis. The toasts were: "Our Guesta,"
responded to by the Italian Embassador,
Signor Des Planches; "American Uni
versities and Colleges," by Dr. William
R. Harper, president of the University of
Chicago: "Congress and Its Relations to
the Military Academy," David B. Hen
derson, Speaker of the House of Repre
sentatives; "The Army," General Miles;
"The Navy," Captain French E. Chad
wick; "The Staff and the Army Schools,"
Adjutant General Corbln; "The Volun
teers," Majd^ General Daniel E. Sickles;
"The National Guard," Major General
Dick of Ohio National Guard.
Gentlemen, I do not intend to preach to you
on thÂ« performance of your duties here, but
It is your special business to learn them. I do
not ask you to remember the difference in the
military profession from what it has been in
the past, and to remember continually that
soldiership does not consist of excellence on
the parade-ground, but efficiency in actual
service on the field, and that the usefulness,
and really great usefulness, of the parade
grounds and barracks work comes in its being
used, not as an end. but as one of the ele
ments to the end. I do not ask you to re
member what you can't forget, thÂ© lesson of
loyalty, of courage, of steadfast adherence to
the highest standards of honor which all men
draw in when they breathe the atmosphere of
this great Institution.
served in time of peace a couple of years In an
Eastern garrison he practically had next to
nothing outside the parade ground and bar
racks to do. or if he had been in an ordinary
National Guard regiment, that one of two
things was true â if he had understood that he
had only learned 5 per cent of war he was
that 5 per cent better than any one else, and
that was a big advancement, and if he had
thought that he .had learned the other 05 per
cent, he was worse than any one else.
Now, gentlemen, that Is not surprising. That
Is what we have a right to expect from this
military university founded by the nation. But
I am glad that the expectation has been made
good, and of all the Institutions in this coun
try none is more absolutely American, none
more. In the proper sense of the -word, abso
lutely democratic than this. Here we care
nothing for the boy's birthplace, for^the boy's
Colonel Mills, I claim to be a historian, and
I soeak simply as a reciter of facts when I
say -what I have said, and more than that â
not merely has West Point contributed a
greater number of the men who stand highest
on the nation's honor roll, but I think beyond
Question that taken as a whole the average
graduate of West Point during this hundred
years has given a greater amount of service to
the country during his life than has the aver
age graduate of any other- institution in this
broad land.
Colonel Mills, the graduates of West Point
and you men and women who are drawn to
them by ties of citizenship or by the simple
fact that you are Americans, and therefore of
necessity drawn to them: I am glad to have
the chance of saying a word to you to-day.
There is little need for me to say how well
your performance has compared with prophetic
promise made on your behalf by the greatest
of Americans â Washington. This institution
has comDleted its first hundred years of life.
During that century no other educational in
stitution in the land has contributed as many
names as West Point has contributed to the
honor roll of the nation's citizens.
PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
immediately after luncheon the hun
dreds of visitors sought Memorial Hall,
a new stona structure, where the exer
cises were held. The President, escorted
by the cadets and leading a notable party
of officers, came across ttie parade ground
and soon after his entrance the speaking
began. Colonel Mills made an address of
welcome, and then introduced President
Roosevelt, who said, In part:
While the reception which followed the

itors.
President Roosevelt's party included

ter-in-law. The President was met at
the station by Superintendent Mills and
his staff and the staff of the academy.
When the President reached the crest a
salute of twenty-one guns was fired. The
cadets were drawn up in line on the pa
rade ground.' The President was driven
to the home of Colonel Mills, and then
he walked across the street to the pa
rade grounds and reviewed the cadets.
Grouped about the President were Post
master General Payne, Secretary Root,
General Horace Porter. Secretary Cor

the award of the medal to Titus for
gallant and daring conduct at the battle

DAMAGE IH IOWA
DES MOINES. Iowa, June 11.â Very
meager details of the storm, that passed
over Central Iowa have been received. It
is known that the storm struck the town
of Jordan, a few miles east of Boone.
It is reported that no lives were lost, but
that some of the buildings of the place
were destroyed. Oskaloosa reports con
siderable damage from the wind.
Grinnell reports that the town of
Laurel, Marshall County, was destroyed
by a tornado last night. Laurel is in Jef
ferson Township, Marshall "County, and
has a population not to exceed 100
people.
CORWITH, Iowa, June 11.â A tornado
struck an empty excursion train on the
Iowa Central a few miles east of here last
night and blew three cars from the track
while the train was running thirty miles
an hour. The engine and two last coaches
remained on the track. No one was hurt.
Thirteen locomotives owned by the Illi
nois Central, two owned by the Iowa
Central, four owned by the Toledo, Pe
orla and Western, and five owned by the
Big Four, were wrecked.
.The storm struck Morton, a small vil
lage fifteen miles below here, and Ed
ward Beeman was killed by a falling
timber.
A farmer named Ellison was killed
while attempting to save his horses.
The Peorla and Peking roundhouse was
blown down shortly after 10 o'clock- Sam
uel Spence, an Iowa Central engineer,
was caught by the falling walls and se
riously injured. â¢
George Reardon, an employe of the elec
tric company, was instantly killed to-day
by a live. wire while repairing the storm
damage-at Glen Oak Park.
PEORIA, 111., June 1Lâ The double
storm that struck Peorla at 10 o'clock last
night and again at 2 o'clock this morning
was the worst that has been experienced
since 1843. Rain fell In torrents and the
damage caused by the high winds is ines
timable at this time. Probably the worst
damage in proportion to the size of the
tftwn was at Kingston, a small mining
town twenty miles below Peoria, There
three persons were killed outright and ten
were injured, three fatally.
The dead: .Mrs. Thomas Murray, infant
child of Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Robert Mc-
Elwee.
VICTIMS OP STORM.

proud to be an American and a fellow-citizen
of such people.
Your business here at West Point has been
to teach men to do well In war, but it is a
noteworthy .fact that you have also taught
them to do well in peace. The highest political
positions in the land have been held, not ex
ceptionally, but again and again, by West
Pointers. Colonel Mills. I make the answer
that any man who Is asked the question must
make when I say that, while we would have
the right to expect that West Point would do
well, we could . not have expected that she
would have done so very well as she has done.
And now in closing. I want to say one word
to those* who are graduates and the younger
graduates as well. I was greatly struck the
other day by an article of one of your in
structors here, himself a graduate of West
Point. In. which, he dwelt upon the- changed
condition of warfare and of the absolute need
that a man who was to be a good officer should
I want, you to weigh what I say, for if you
take only half of it you will invert what I
say. I found in my regiment that the best
man was the man who had been in . the reg
ular army . In actual service out In Western
campaigning on the plains, that if he had been
a good "man In the regular army, out on the
plains, he was the- best man that I could get
hold of; and, on the other hand, If bo had
â¢meet these changed conditions. I* think It Is,
going to be a great deal harder to be a first-,
class officer in the future than it has been in
the past. - I think that In addition to tho cour
age and steadfastness that: have.- always .been,
the prime requisites in a soldier, you have eot
to" show . a , far greater power of individuality
than has been- necessary before, if you are go
ing to get up to the highest level of officer-like
performance of duty.
As has been well said, the developments of
war. in' the last few years have shown that the
unit will not be 'tha regiment or the company,
but the unit will be the individual man. If
he does not know how to shoot, how to 'shift
for himself, how both to obey . orders- and to ac
cept responsibility whii an emergency comes,
he. won't- have any orders to obey. If , he is
not able. to do all of that you had better have
him out of ' the army. In a battle hereafter
each man is going to be to a considerable ex
tent alone. - It will be ' so that the youngest
officers 4 will" have to take much of the respon
sibility that in former wars fell , on their
seniors, and many of the enlisted men" will have
to do most of their work without the super
vision of any officer. The man will have to
act largely, alone, and If he shows a tendency
to huddle up to some one else his usefulness Is
pretty - near at an end. If he is nervous, so
that he. want3 to feel the touch of elbows, ht
had better be out of the battle: and you offi
cers, if you are going: to do well, have got to
learn how to perform the duty which is so
essential.- The task is a hard one and you
want to face that task. You want to realize
that, more than ever before, the honor or the
ehame of the country depends upon the high
1 average of character and capacity of the offi
cers : and enlisted men. and that high average
of character and capacity in the enlisted man
can to a large degree only be obtained through
you. the officers: and that you have got to de
vote your time in bringing up to the standard
the fighting efficiency of the men under you,
not merely . In doing your duty so that you
cannot be called to account -for failure to per
form it, but doing it in a way that will make
each man under you able to perform his.
The people in Hermoslllo think the Ya
qui uprising was crushed by the recent
Mexican victories, but Americans in So
nera believe the slaughter will only causa
the rebellion to spread among now peace
able Indians, and that It will break out
with Increased fury.
The Yaqui force3 are led by a former
Mexican rancher, whom they rescued,
from .the Jail at .Ur.es. He was a man of
much prominence, but was arrested for
smuggling and sentenced to thirty years'
imprisonment. A party of Yaqui spies
entered Ures, outwitted the Jailer and
rescued the imprisoned rancher, who goes
by the name of Martinez. He bad always
been kind to Yaqui laborers when a pro
prietor. They had great confidence in
him. and it is reported that he has been
directing their movements and has taken
a place similar to that occupied by Chief
Maldonado, who was at the head of the
Yaquis during the raid which ended six
years ago. Maldonado was afterward
killed, and for a long time the Yaquis
have been without a leader.
Colonel Christy says that rurales and
regulars have orders to kill all male Ya
quis found out of employment. This was
Illustrated yesterday, when a friendly
Yaqui miner went to Prietas for supplies
and was killed by the rurales on the out
skirts of the town.
DEATH TO ALL- YAQUIS.
Colonel Christy said that, as a rule,
the yaquis do not molest Americans, al
though four Americans were killed by
the Indians a few days ago nine miles
north of Minas Prietas. Colonel Christy
and his party, guided by an American
who spoke the Yaqui language, rode on
mules- overland from his mines on thÂ»
Yaqui River to Hermosillo, a distance of
ninety miles. They met many Yaquia,
but were not molested when they ex
plained their errand.
The report of the merciless massacre
has caused great Indignation in Southern
Arizona, many of the Americans being in
sympathy with the Yaquis. There are
many people in Hermosillo who do not
approve of the tactics of Torres and Her
nandez. The majority of the population,
however, was anxious to avenge the des
perate battle at Aguajito, where so many
Mexican privates and two gallant officers
lost their lives. General Torres was at
Minas Prietas when the slaughter in
Ulvala Canyon took place.
General Hernandez excused the slaugh
ter by saying that it was impossible to
separate the women and children; that ho
had orders to kill all Yaqui men and that
the women and children had to be sacri
ficed.
EXCUSE OP HEBNANDEZ.
The women and children who escaped
numbered two hundred and eighty-four,
according to the official report of General
Torres. A dispatch from Hermoslllo says
that they arrived there to-day, . escorted
by a heavy guard.
At daylight they opened fire on men,
women and children alike, killing indis
criminately. The troops kept firing as
long as there was a Yaqui alive. When
they finally ceased firing, eighty-seven
Yaqui men had fallen and one hundred
and thirty women and children, many of
the- latter infants, were lying dead in tha
narrow canyon.
under the command of General Augustine
Garcia Hernandez hemmed in the Yaquis
in Ulvala Canyon, in the Mazatan Moun
tains. About one hundred Y^jui men were
guarding the women and children, while
the main body of the army was near
Santa Rosa. The troops under Hernandez
were guided to the scene of the subse
quent slaughter on Sunday night by loyal
Yaqui scouts and completely surrounded
'the Indians.

Thousands of wise and prudent parents
nave made their children happy, healthy
and vigorous by giving them nature's
medicine, Palne's Celery Compound. In
many severe and complicated cases
Paine's Celery Compound has restored
health, when the little ones were given up
by physicians.
In the home and at school the children
have their times of ill-health and suffer-

tion. All such symptoms and ailments
mean that the seeds of disease will have
a fast and firm hold, unless proper meas-
ures are taken to restore a perfect condi-
tion of health.
The children. God bless them, are the

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
You may have a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root and a book that tells more
about it, both sent absolutely free, by
mail. Address Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bing-
hamton. N. Y. .When writing mention
that you read this generous offer in tho
San Francisco Sunday Call. Don't make
any mistake, but remember the name.
Swamp-Root, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,
and the address, Binghamton, N.' T., on
every bottle.
There is comfort in tho knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, pains in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold
water and scalding pain in passing it, or
bad effects following use of liquor, wine
or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day and to get up many times
during the night. Tho mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its
Â¦wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists In nf ty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.
WHAT TO DO.
Fill a bottle or common glass with your
water and let It stand twenty-four hours;
a sediment' or settling indicates an un-
healthy .condition of the kidneys - r if - it
stains the linen it is evidence of kidney
trouble; too frequent desire to pa3s it. or
pain in the back is also convincing proof
that the kidneys and bladder are out oÂ£
order.
HOW TO FIND OUT.
.Â« Favorite Prescription" has the testi-
mony of thousands of women to its com-
plete cure of womanly diseases. Do not
accept an unknown and unproved sub-
stitute in its place. ' :
Pr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets are the
best laxative for family use.
"I had been ailing 1 some time, troubled with
female weakness," writes Mrs. Wra. H. Johnson.
of Avoadalc, Chester Co., Pa. "Every month I
would have to lie on my back. I tried many
different medicines and nothing gave me relief
until I began Dr. Pierce's medicines, using two
bottles of ' Favorite Prescription ' and two of
'Golden Medical Discovery.' These medicines
have cured me. When I began vour treatment
I was not able to do Terv mucn. but now I do
the work for my family of nine, and feel better
to-day than I have for a year. I thank you.
doctor, from the bottom of my heart, for well
do I know that you are the one who cured me."
Sick women are invited to consult Dr.
Pierce by letter./^. All correspondence
strictly private and sacredly confidential.
Address Dr. R. V. Pierce, Buffalo, N. Y.
Family cares and duties do not weigh
down the well woman, and the children
are never in her way. But when the
womanly health fails, and there is a con-
stant struggle Â¦ with weakness and pain,
household duties are a burden almost
past bearing, and children are a cease-
less annoyance and worry.
Weak women are made strong and
sick women are made well by the use of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. It
establishes regularity, dries disagreeable
drains, heals inflammation ana ulcera-
tion and cures female weakness.

Where was General Methuen when the war went

There have been times when West Point. has been
subject to criticism, but hi the main the critics have
Hardly ever before has the value of professional
training been more strikingly proven than in that
long contest At the outbreak of the struggle it is
probable the sympathies of the mass of the people
both North and South were . with the * volunteers
rather than with the. West Pointers. Nor were -the
sympathies wholly misplaced. From the ranks of
the volunteers came forth a brilliant galaxy of com
manders, men whom the coflntry honored and re
members still. Nevertheless it soon became evident
that the conduct of the war must be left to the
trained men, and to-day West Point can attest her
worth to the nation by citing the names of Grant,
Sherman. Sheridan, Thomas, McClellan and Burn
side on the side of the North, and Lee, Jackson,
Johnston and Stuart on the side of the South.
Judged by its history and the record made by its
graduates West- Point is the foremost military school
in the world. The long Civil -War in this country
gave an opportunity for its graduates to show the
worth of their training, arid the test was a severe
one. Among no people in the world are volunteer
armies more efficient than among Americans, and
nowhere else are there among the ranks of volunteers
so many men capable of exercising high commands.
Therefore when the war broke out and the graduates
of West Point undertook the command of armies on
both sides of the struggle, they were brought, into
sharp rivalry with a host of volunteer officers, able,
active, patriotic, daring and resourceful. Yet in both
armies the West Pointers proved themselves su
perior to" the most efficient of the untrained generals
who shared with them the responsibilities of the war.
EASTERN news reports are giving but little at
tention to the West Point centennial, which is
being observed this week, and yet the institu
tion has rilled so large a place in American history
that the occasion merits something more than a pass
ing notice. In the graduating class of 1802 there were
but two men, and for a time the classes were small, as
by the original act creating it the entire corps was
limited to twenty officers and men. The war of 1812,
however, roused the American people to a recogni
tion of the needs of military education and defense,
and since that time West Point has been amply sup-,
ported. â¢

We wish the two counties realization of all their ex
pectations and hope they may find gold or coal in
making their bore.
The example of those two counties may well be
followed elsewhere in this mountainous State, where
producers and their market are separated by ranges
that may easily be penetrated by tunnels. While this
tunnel is being constructed it raight be well for Oak
land to consider it as a future facility for introducing
a needed water supply, and build it of dimensions
with that view, that it may carry water pipes as well
as wagons.
When railroads began easing their grades and
changing curves for tangents it was not dreamed that
the users of wagon roads would so quickly imitate
them. Nor is it probable that they would have done
so but for the spirit of enterprise that has so grandly
taken hold upon Northern California.
The project has been under discussion for many
years and much time was spent bringjng the two
counties into co-ordination in the matter. Then
difficulties were presented in getting the right of
way. Of these the last has just been compromised,
and the tunnel, which will cost many thousand dol
lars, will soon be under construction and will be
rapidly pushed. Oakland is to be congratulated upon
thts means of access to'an extensive and rich region,
as the producers therein are to be for this means of
getting to a good market.
INCIDENT to the spirit of progress that is now
abroad in Northern California is the alliance of
Contra Costa and Alameda counties in a project'
for tunneling the Coast Range for a wagon road,
which will permit the whole Mount Diablo region
access to Oakland by easy grade, so that produce
may come to market by wagon. Heretofore it has
been necessary to carry on this traffic under the diffi
culties presented by steep grades and dangerous
curves, on which many accidents have happened and
where the hauling of a full load- has been impossible.
We think it is the first instance on this continent in
which a tunnel is made for the convenience of a
wagon haul.

Mr. Wright's conclusion is that strikes on the
whole have been beneficial, but that workingmen in
future will have less recourse to them. He says:
"With increased intelligence they will look back
upon the strike, period as one of development, and
when they shall have accommodated themselves, to
the new conditions and when employers shall have
recognized the intelligence of their employes, these
matters will be handled in such a way as to prevent
in the future a repetition of . incidents like .those
which are chronicled in the statistical history of the
strikes of the last twenty years."
The estimate is made that 50.77 per cent of the
strikes for the twenty years succeeded; 13.04 per cent
were partially successful, and 36.19 per cent failed
Of the strikes directed by labor organizations 52.86
per cent were successful, 13.60 per cent were partly
successful, and 33.54 failed. Of the employes thrown
out of employment by strikes 71.60 per cent were
engaged in six industries, building, coal and coke,
metals and metallic goods, clothing, tobacco and
transportation, and 59 per cent of the strikes took
place in these occupations. New York had the lar
gest number of strikes,. with Pennsylvania next.
The year 1894 is given as the period of "high water
mark of labor controversies," though of course there
have been notable strikes since then. Passing to the
statistics of the subject Mr. Wright presents tables
showing that during the twenty years the losses to
employers and employes through strikes amount to
about $468,968,581, more than 6,000,000 persons hav
ing been thrown out of employment for an average
of 23.8" days. -
As the nineteenth century advanced strikes became
more and more v frequent, but according to Mr.
Wright "there were no notable strikes until 1877,
"those which . occurred prior thereto not being very
important as to the persons engaged or losses or
.otherwise, although some of them were severe in the
conditions accompanying them. J .^ V. 'Â¦Â¦*â¢
It was after that year that, the great labor war-be
gan in earnest and the struggles between employer
and employe became notable. Since that time there
have been strikes having a wide and far reaching in
fluence, affecting the general trade conditions of
whole communities. It is noted that the first of
what may be called historic strikes took place in 1877
on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The Pennsyl
vania road was subject 'to an extraordinary strike in
the same* year. Mr. Wright says: "Without doubt
the most expensive and far Teaching of historic
strikes was the strike of June and July, 1894, at Chi
cago, but the most thrilling and dramatic incident or
event in the labor movement of the country must be
considered the Homestead affair of July 4, 1892."
As early as 1740 an effort was made by a strike of
the journeymen bakers in New York to obtain an
increase of wages. The instigators of the movement
were tried and convicted of conspiracy on. account, of
their agreement- not to bake bread until their wages
were raised. In. 1796 and 1798 the journeymen shoe
makers of Philadelphia struck for better wages, and
the strikes were successful. Those . were the only
strikes in the country prior to the nineteenth cen
tury, for, as" Mr. Wright says: "Industrial condi
tions were not particularly conducive to such con
troversies. Relations between masters and men were
individual, so that concerted action among the men
was seldom practicable."

The opinion is written by Justice Me-.
Farland, with whom Justices Henshaw,
Garoutteand Harrison and Chief Justice
Beatty concur. Justice Van Dyke, with
whom Justice Temple concurs, dissents
on the ground that the law discriminates
in favor of sportsmen, and hence It is
class legislation.
The court holds that all game is really
the property of the State, that sports
men kill animals only by sufferance and
that the Legislature in granting favors Â¦
can make what qualifications may seem
proper. It is stated that the prohibition
in reference to the sale of game "does
not destroy, a property right, because no
such right exists."
The new game laws were declared con
stitutional by the Supreme Court yester
day. The fight between . the . Fish ..Com- ,
missioners and the commission merchants
is at an end. and it is now firmly estab
lished that any one who ventures to sell
game in violation of the existing regula
tions is guilty of a misdemeanor.
The law which was .made the subject
of dispute reads as follows: "Every per
son who buys, sells, offers or exposes for
sale, barter or trade any quail â¢ â¢ â¢ is
guilty of a misdemeanor." The provision,
with certain qualifications as to seasons,
is made to apply to several other species
of game. The observance of the law\
meant that the commission merchants
must be subjected to considerable loss,
and, in fact, that every one who could
not hunt or who did not have some friend
who was a sportsman and of a generous
turn of mind, must go without those
kinds of game named in the section. It
was thought by many lawyers that the
provision was unconstitutional, and tho
commission merchants decided to settle
the question.,
S. Kenneke, a clerk in one of the large
markets, was accordingly prevailed upon
to sell a quail. The Fish Commissioners
were at once notified, and the offender;
was arrested. He entered a plea of guilty
In the Police Court, and was fined $2a.
The case was appealed and petition made
to the' Supreme Court for a writ of.
habeas corpus on the ground that the
law was unconstitutional in that It was
not uniform In operation and discriminat
ed in favor of a certain class/ It was
also claimed that when a man had killed
a quail it\became his property, and that
he could dispose of it through sale or oth
erwise as might suit his taste.
With interest at the same moment 125 per cent
higher in, Denver than in New York, 'how can the
currency question be kept out of politics?
But can he insure the future against such an issue
in politics when interest is 4.41 in New York and
from 7.98 to 10 in the South and West? He may say
that it depends on supply and demand, but the figures
show that there was a surplus of money and defi
ciency of demand in New York, with low interest,
and a surplus of demand and deficiency of money in
the West and South, with high interest.
It is hardly possible to bring these reasons into
comparison with those given for the bill, since Mr.
Pugsley argues from the viewpoint of the banker or
lender, while the friends of the bill argue from that
of the borrower. Mr. Pugsley expresses the wish of
all sensible men when he, says: "I believe the inter-i
ests and the honor of the country clearly demand
that there never again shall be a political contest in
which the currency, or standard of value, shall be the
issue. It concerns too vitally the great interests of
the people to be made the_ football of politics, for no
question will so quickly unsettle and paralyze the vast
business industries of the country as one that con
cerns the stability of our currency." â¢ .'
Mr. Pugsley admits the need of protecting the
country against a currency famine. He describes the
Fowler plan in these terms and we reproduce it, as it
probably represents the views of the opposing. bank
ers: "The. plan of the majority members of the
Banking and Currency Committee is to formulate an
asset currency in preftrence to the thoroughly tested
system cf circulation now based on Government
bonds, a circulation that is received without question
in any part of the United States. They also provide
for a branch bank system, 'thus forming a great
money trust, which will reach throughout the whole
country and undoubtedly put out of existence, if the
measure become a law, a large proportion of the
smaller banks, both State and national, in the United
States. The large banks of the great cities will be
authorized and will be able, through their large capi
tal, to establish branches in any part of the United
â¢States and foreign countries, and it will be in their
p&wer to plant a branch in any city or town, which
will mean that an office will be hired, some fixtures
arranged and a manager put in charge. No capi
tal is provided to follow the branch. institution, and
it will be virtually free from all taxation, except at
the parent bank. This will of necessity enable ihe
branch bank system to drive out of existence State
and national banks in the small towns and cities,
which are now heavily taxed in the communities
where they are located, and in the course of a few
years there will probably be only a very small num
ber of banks, and they will be able to control the
banking capital and deposits of the whole country.
This control may then be used as a great political
power for the furtherance of the ends of these insti
tutions in securing such legislation as may be neces
' sary for fastening this octopus on the American peo
ple. As to equalizing t^he rate of interest, which it is
claimed the branch bank system will accomplish, any
one with a modicum ot common sense knpws that the
rate of interest will depend upon location, quality of
collateral and, above all, on the oft-repeated but cer
tain principle of supply and demand." .
The reasons against the bill are put forward by
Congressman Pugsley of New York. He is a sound
money Democrat and an experienced banker, and his
opinions are deserving of respect. He compliments
Mr. Fowler for his knowledge of the subject and the
industry with which he has worked out the bill, but
declares that it is a too radical departure in our bank
ing and currency system. -
WE. have already given the reasons for the
Fowler bill, which is favored by the House
Committee on Banking and Currency and
is quite generally opposed by the bankers of the
country. The bill is intended to" supply an emergency
currency by an issue based on assets other than
United States bonds, and by establishing branch
banks to more nearly equalize interest and discount
throughout the country, thus relieving points remote
from financial centers of the consequences of a cur
rency famine.

When asked what was meant by the
phrase "leaders of thought" in hi3 bill
to the Cuban Government, Thurber said
he had a list of 8000 people in the United
States who "represent something" to
whom this literature was sent.
In reply to a question by Teller as to
whether he had consulted Mr. Havemeyer
of the sugar trust in the preparation of
the literature, Thurber said:
"After making my argument before the
Ways and Means Committee I told Mr.
Havemeyer that I had been asked if I
was representing him and asked him for
a subscription. He gave me a check to
ward meeting our expenses."

large number of circulars in the interest
of a reduction of the duty on Cuban
sugar, and he submitted specimens of
some of them. Being asked by Teller
who paid the expense incident to the
circulation of this literature, the witness
replied that the Cuban committee had
paid the larger part of it and that mem
bers of the association had paid part of
it. He said he had been in the employ

who were favoring reciprocity. He was
not, he said, under salary from the Ex
port Association, but he admitted he had
received a percentage of lees for member

He said he had received a contribution
of $2500 from Mr. Havemeyer of the sugar

for a substantial subscription.

ceived the amount and said it was ons of
three payments he had received from the
same source. The receipt was dated
April 2, 1902, and states that it was for
"advocating a reduction in the duties
on Cuban products with a reciprocal re
duction on United States products going
into Cuba."

A SPLENDID POSITION
PICNIC AT SHELL MOUND
ATTRACTS BIG CBOWD
ry jj ARRISBURG. Pa.. June 11. â
I i â â i 1 Jud B e Samuel W. Pennypacker
1 I - of Philadelphia was nominated
J| It* for Governor over Attorney Gen
eral John P. Elkin of Indiana by
to-day's Republican State convention by
a vote of 206 to 152. Senator Quay was
unanimously chosen chairman of the Re
publican State Committee by a suspen
sion of the rules requiring the chairman
to be chosen by the nominees and the pre
siding officers of the convention, and he
will conduct the campaign for the State
ticket. During the proceedings Senator
been rendered by him and that all had
been oaid. Â¦ â¢ . '
Thurber,,' at the outset of his testimony,
in response to questions by Senator Platt.
said that he had not tried to avoid ap
pearing before the committee, stating that
he had been absent frpm'his home most
of the time since the receipt of "his first
summons to appear. I
. Professor H. W. Wiley, chief \ of the
chemistry division of the Agricultural De
partment, followed Thurber on the stand.
His testimony was devoted to an exposi
tion of the European kartel bounty on
sugar, which he contended had been the
cause of the entire reduction in the price
of sugar which had taken place through
out the world in the last two years. Quot
ing the .price of beet sugar at Hamburg
for June, 1900, he showed that it had
fallen since 52 per cent. He said the
depression in sugar is world-wide and ad
vocated the meeting of this European
duty with a similar duty by the United
States. On f this point he said, among
other thlnus: "
"Since England is the greatest consumer
of bounty-fed sugar among the nations of
the earth and the United States the sec
ond, it is evident that if these two coun
tries should join in countervailing not
only official but kartel bounties instant
prosperity would at once come to â¢ the
sugar growers of the whole world."
The testimony given by Thurber, show-
Ing that between $8000 and $9000 had been
paid out of the Cuban treasury under the
direction of Governor General Wood for
the promotion of the effort to secure re
ciprocity between the United States and
Cuba, caused a sensation in the Senate
to-day. The news of Thurber's statement
reached the Senate | chamber about the
time that body had convened, and when
Senator Aldrich expresses confidence In
being able to secure fully forty-five Re
publican votes in favor of any bill that
may be reported . by the Cuban Commit
tee. This is .a majority of the Senate,
and the friends of reduction express
themselves as hopeful of passing a bill
satisfactory to them. They say the tes
timony of Thurber does not affect: the
merits of the question in the least, and
they contend that, admitting that thÂ«
course of the Cuban Government was
censurable, it cannot and should not pre
vent the Government of the United States
doing what it has promised to do an-i
what it is right to do. They do not, how
ever, admit that the course was improper.
The : beet sugar Senators undeniably are
more hopeful than they have been here
tofore. Some of them profess to believe
that . the revelation will have the effect
of at least causing a halt in, the proceed
ings in the interest of reciprocity.
The committee will say that both plans
were rejected, and that the members of
the Cuban Committee i would not change
their position that there must be a
straight reduction of 20 per cent without
any conditions except that the President
might have power to" revoke the conces
sion in case he found that the Cuban
planters were not getting Jhe benefit of it.
The full conference will be in the nature
of a caucus, and some of the beet sugar
men say they .will enter it only, with the
understanding that they shall not be
bound by any conclusion that may be
reached. The advocates of a tariff re
duction say that no action by a Republi
can Senatorial caucus is binding, but they
add that defections have occurred only
in rare instances.
MAY CHECK BEDXTCTION-.
Senator Teller, whose examination had
developed the facts, made his appearance
on the floor he was immediately surround
ed by Senators from both sides of the
chamber, who professed great anxiety to
know all that had occurred. Copies of
the one voucher produced were . eagerly
sought, and the demand was not satisfied
until forty or fifty copies had been type
written and circulated in the Senate
chamber. Much interest 'was also mani
fested on the part of the members of the
House and some of the beet sugar advo
cates of that body pointed out that Thur
ber had not in his testimony before thu
AVays and Means Committee indicated
any connection with the Cuban Govern
ment in his effort to create sentiment in
this country favorable to concessions to
Cuba; Opinions as to the ultimate effect
of the testimony are as varied as the
predilections and prejudices of the Sen
ate, but the immediate results are seen in
the decision reached during the afternoon
to have two caucuses in the early future.
The first of these will be held by the beet
sugar Republican Senators to-morrow and
the second by all the Republican Senators
Friday or Saturday.
Senator Burrows is responsible for the
statement that the beet sugar men will
meet, and Senator Aldrich for the an
nouncement that there will be a general
conference 'before the close of the week.
The purpose of the meeting of the beat
sugar men is to consider the situation as
affected by to-day's developments and
also to receive a report from the commit
tee," consisting of Senators Elkins, Bur
rows and Jones of Nevada, appointed to
confer with the Republican members of
the Cuban Committee. This committee
will state that .the Cuban Committee has
declined to consider all propositions look-
Ing to a compromise which have been
made, and it probably will ask to be
discharged. The propositions that have
been made are two â the first for a re
bate and the second for a commercial
treaty with Cuba.
PORTLAND, Me., June 11.â Governor
John G. Hill was to-day renominated by
acclamation for a second term by the
Republican State convention. Secretary
of the-Treasury Shaw was presented and
made an address, in which he discussed
the tariff reform and the alleged cruel
ties in the Philippines as a possible issue
in the coming campaign.
HILL IS BENOMINATED.
Elkin declined to withdraw. Quay then
made a public declaration against his
candidacy, and when Pennypacker was
suggested for the nomination the Senator
tacitly indorsed him. Elkin was backed
by Governor Stone and other members
of 'the. State administration. Quay as
sumed direction of Pennypacker's cam
paign, and from the start predicted that
Elkin would not be nominated. :
Pennypacker's nomination is a personal
victory for Senator Quay. Elkin was for
merly one of Quay's chief lieutenants,
and when he became a candidate it was
thought he was the Senator's choice.
After delegates friendly to Elkin had been
elected in several counties Quay advised
against the Attorney General's candidacy
in the interest of party harmony.

"We can account for Plaw's defeat only
by considering he has reached the limit of
his powers. He met a better man than
himself In Dewitt of Princeton. In prac
tice before the Princeton meet Plaw
threw the hammer more than 170 feet. He
became rattled In competition." ,
, "The score at Yale should have been
closer. Hussey would have won the
broad jump had he not sprained his leg
at the first jump. Redewell lost the mile
run through a wrong decision.
"We beat Princeton in single competi
tion because ours is a better balanced
team. Princeton secured a higher place
at Mott Haven as. she has several star
men who are sure winners In their events.
"We were outclassed at Yale and at tho
Mctt Haven games. We should never
have met Chicago, as by that time we
were worn-out. I feel the team made the
best showing possible considering the
transcontinental trip and the climatic
conditions under which we trained and
competed.

Hake a Sad Start in. the Southern
Series.
LOS AXGELES, June 1Lâ The Senators
presented rather a patched front to the
Seraphs to-day, and were 'defeated with
ease. Pete Dowling made an unim
pressive start In the pitcher's box. He
retired at the beginning of the third in
ning in favor of Mike Steffani, who was
batted hard in the seventh and eighth in
nings.
Good fielding by the locals kept the
score down. The Senators' first run was
made in the fourth on Lawler's base hit,
Hanlon's error, a stolen base and Ung
laub's two-base hit. Their ' other run
was made in the 6ixth, when Unglaub
put the ball over the, fence for a home
run. Jones pitched good ball and fielded
his position in style. Score:

â¢ A welcome of most extraordinary pro
portion has been given to Henry Miller,
Margaret Anglin and their excellent com

Their engagement Is the event of many

the ancient Daly splendors, and is -preg

Miss Roberts is very well supported, and
the â¢ stage management . is uncommonly
good, the first scene, "behind the scenes"
of a variety show, in particular, being
cleverly handled. White Whittlesey is the
unheroic hero with some enjoyment, and
George Osbourne does some good work as
Cascart, Zaza's "singing partner." Geor
gie Woadthorpe is a decldely competent
aunt to the fascinating Zaza. It looks
as if the play had come to stay for at
least two weeks.
this week. With every visit Miss
Roberts shows progress, and vzaza"
seems to offer her a peculiarly grateful
opportunity. Mrs. Carter's flaming
lccked termagant is riot forgotten, .but
Miss Roberts gives to the full as inter
esting a conception of the character. It
is played throughout in lighter key than
Mrs. Carter conceived to be proper to the
role, but the* interpretation is justified by
the successful result. The mingled good
nature and bad temper of the creature
is suggested with more naturalness, her
atmosphere of the street implied with
greater suppleness and also with less,
coarseness. Miss Roberts has, further,
very cleverly suggested the unreasoning,
childlike elements of the character and
throughout Is markedly spontaneous. Mrs.
Carter rather has it in the heavier scenes,
though the Alcazar favorite is by no
means lacking on the emotional side.
Then, too, Miss Roberts has a sound ap
preciation of the humor of the role, and
has wisely dressed the part J very hand
somely. Any one interested in the Zaza
kind of person and her waysâ the house
was full of them last night â cannot do
better than see the .week's bill at the Al
cazar.

this week, with MaudÂ© Fealy in the third
week of her engagement in the title role.
Miss Fealy is strengthening the favor
able impression created by her first efforts
with every new. appearance and makes a
charming figure out of the somewhat un
promising material ] afforded . by Miss
Hobbs. The clever young woman is well
supported by the house company, in par
ticular by Herschel Mayall as Wolff

the California Theater this week. The
clever company that Mr. Neill has suc
ceeded in 'gathering round him is seen to

its manifest advantage, and Mr. Nelll,

the resources now at his command Mr.
Miller could not undertake. Twenty-s'x
players, almost all of the foremost in
their several lines of work, are numbered
in the company. The cast now giving
"Trelawny of the Wells" could not be
bettered, and a most enjoyable. evening's
entertainment may be had by any one
who attends. The play deals, largely with
the life of actors in the early sixties, and
Its highly amusing comedy is delightfully
accentuated by the quaint setting and
costumes. "Trelawny" will run another
week and should by no means be missed.

master of the empire and the master of
millionaires threshed out their respective
ideas.
In the beginning the international ban
quet proceeded somewhat formally, but
the vivacious humor of the King and
Queen soon put the guests at their ease.
Throughout the dinner music was ren
dered by an excellent band. Finally Queen
Alexandra gave the sign and the ladies
rose and retired, to the drawins:-room.
The table was elaborately decorated
with American Beauty roses. Mr. Choate
and his wife sat opposite each other at
the center, of the table, at .which forty
covers had been laid. Queen Alexandra,
who was dressed becomingly in- an even
ing gown of black and white,, touched
here and there with costly jewels, and
who wore a diamond tiara, sat at Mr.
Choate's right-hand. On his left sat
Princess Victoria, while next to the Prin
cess sat Lord Lansdowne. On the oppo
site side of the table sat Mrs. - Choate.
with King Edward on her right and the
Duke of Norfolk on her left.
Greetings had scarcely been exchanged
before dinner was announced and the
party became somewhat mixed up. Mr.
Choate found himself leading the Queen
Into the dining-room, ahead of the King,
who had Mrs. Choate on his arm. Pre
vious to the beginning of dinner special
servants of their Majesties, covered with
medals, had arrived at Mrs. Choate's
residence and "taken up their places be
hind the chairs at which the King and
Queen were to sit.
When King Edward, Queen Alexandra
and Princess "Victoria with their suites
drove up to Choate's house, the Embas
sador, Mrs. Choate, Miss Choate, Henry
White. Miss White, and Mr. and Mrs.
Carter met.them at the door. The Ameri
can diplomats wore plain evening dress
and black knee breeches. The King and
his suite wore a dress exactly similar to
that of the Americans, except that his
Majesty wore across his shirt front the
blue ribbon of the Order of the Garter.
RECEPTION" TO ROYALTY.
The police had to clear the Charlton
House Terrace of the many spectators
who had congregated there,' anxious to
witness as much as possible of the re
markable tribute paid by their Majesties
to the United States.

8:45 to-night to attend the dinner given
by Mr. and Mrs. Choate. Their Majesties

people of the city
The following resolution, introduced by
J. H. Harvey, was adopted with great en
thusiasm: Ftmnim ihihf

tion. .
A resolution presented by J. G. Boyne,
urging all citizens to register at once, was

Resolved. That a copy of the aforesaid reso
lution be spread in full upon our minutes and

URGE CITIZENS TO REGISTER.
Several" of the district meetings were en
livened by spirited speeches. : Resolutions
were adopted congratulating the good
government forces of San Jose on their
recent ..triumph over the bosses. In the
Forty-f ourth District several resolutions
were adopted,* among them the following,
introduced by I. 'Ellas:
The promoters and active workers of the
league are highly, gratified over this early
demonstration of strength and are confi
dent that delegates to the State Conven
tion proposed by the league clubs will be
elected on August 12.
The eighteen district clubs of. the Re
publican Primary League â one In each As
sembly districtâ met last night for organi
zation. The enrollment of new members
was large and much enthusiasm was dis
played. At league headquarters, 18 Geary
street, the estimate is given that 3000
names were added to the roll of member
ship last night, making the total enroll
ment 14,000.
A meeting of the Fourth of July Com
mittee -was held last night in the Mayor's*
room at the City Hall.
Bruce Cornwall presided, and there were
also prseent the Rev. Terence Caraher,
the Rev. Dr. J. A. B. Wilson, George R.

Desborough, E. L. Wagner, Charle3
Sommerlad, M. W. Coffee, Rev. Dr. M.S.
Levy, .Walter Goff, George B. McClellan,
Walter Gallagher and Dr. Charles Bos
ton.
There was a strong feeling expressed
that there should be some entertainment
provided different to what has been usual
on the Fourth, and after a long discus
sion it was resolved on the motion of Max
Popper that a> committee composed of
Messrs. Desborough, Olsen and Kelly
should wait upon the commodores of the
vaiious yacht clubs with the object of
inaugurating a Fourth of July regatta.
The remarkable and unprecedented il
lumination of the city for the Shriners"
procession on Tuesday night appealed to
George R. Wells as being appropriate for
repetition on the evening of the Fourth.
Mr. Wells also proposed that the parado
take place at night in lieu of the usual
day procession. The matter was. left to
committees to investigate and report.
A committee was requested to wait on
the musicians' union at the suggestion of
a member with a view toward obtaining
voluntary services of members for an
hour's music on thp night of July 3.
As the national holiday will occur on
Friday, it was agreed that a committee
shall wait on the Board of Trade and
ether business interests to suggest that
the following day, Saturday, shall also be
observed as a holiday in the city.
Captain George Ftlmer was appointe.1
grand marshal, and the meeting ad-
Jcurned till next Tuesday afternoon at I
o'clock, when it will meet at the Califor

A family figured carefully on the cost
of food, taking into consideration the
strength and health that Grape-Nuts
furnished. The report is interesting. .
"We first took up Grape-Nuts because
it agreed with me so well. I was suffer-
ing from dyspepsia that medicine did
not relieve. I frequently laughed at the
Idea when some of my friends tcHd of
the use of Grape-Nuts; however, ,one
day "Wife bought a package and we
found it good and it agreed with me.
We were accustomed to using white
bread snd oats, wheat or barley mushes
boiled from two to foup hours. We con-
sidered Grape-Nuts too expensive, but I
noticed that when I had a breakfast of
Grape-Nuts I felt fine, and other days
â¢when white bread and other cereals were
used I felt weak and bloated.
One day about six months ago I said
to Wife, 'I am satisfied that Grape- Nuts
is the thing that makes me feel better
In between the blue spells.* Then we sat
down and figured a while on the co6t of
living and came to the conalusion that
ve could live better and happier on fif-
teen cents* worth of Grape-Nuts than
on twenty-five cents* worth of white
bread or 'cooked -at-home' cereals. You
see four teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts fur-
nish more strength to work on than large
quantities of other food, so we starred
on Grape-Nuts in earnest, using It every
morning, and a wonderful change has
come over me. .
I am gaining in weight every day. Nev-
er have any of the old bloated feelings.
Feel etrong and well and can endure
more hard work than I could on the old
diet, and this result Is all without any
doctor or drugs at all, but directly from
using Grape-Nuts." Name given by Pos-

SAX JOSE. June 1Lâ The Southern Pa
cific Company Is to build a railroad to
Saratoga from either Mountain View . or
Sunnyvale. Some weeks ago the people of
Saratoga and Cupertino and the west side
of the valley appointed a committee to see
the railroad officials and urge construc
tion of a line that would give them con
nection with the outside world. The
proposition was favorably received, and
it is said the road will be constructed
â¢within a year.
The Saratoga, road will leave the main
road at either Mountain View or Sunny
vale, probably the former. It will skirt
the foothills, tapping one of the richest
sections of the valley. In that end of the
valley there is a population of at least
E009 that would be benefited by the road,
and there are large wine, fruit and agri
cultural interests to euppfy freight.
From Saratoga the railroad will be ex
tended to Los Gatos or Campbell, form
ing a loop through the foothills. The dis
tance from Sunnyvale to Saratoga Is
about thirteen miles, and if the road Is
built from Mountain View It will be three
or four miles longer.
A committee of citizens has procured
rights of \ray for almost the entire dis
tance.

NEW YORK. June 11.â There was a further
expansion In dealings on the Stock Exchange
to-day, which was generally attributed to the
resumption of activity by the newly returned
leaders of the Western group. This activity
centered In St. Paul." There was besides an
active market In Missouri Pacific, which had
no apparent connection with St. Paul's move
ment, so far as the Identity of the brokers em
ployed would reveal It. These two stocks ran
a pretty close- race for the leadership of the
market in point of activity, with Missouri Pa
cific getting rather the best ox" it. both in the
volume of dealings and in the extent of the
gain. Just at the close the rtock moved up
more than 2 points over last night. St. Paul's
extreme rise was 1% and w.is not fully held.
Between them thn two stocks made up about
a quarter of the aggregate dealings of the day.
There were considerable gains in ether stocks,
but these seemed to be more or less In sympp
thy, and there was at the same time some sell
ing to take advantage of this sympathetic
strength. There was no evidence that any con
stckrable outside following was attracted to
the- movement. The advance was made in the
face of a feeling of disappointment over the
monthly crop bulletin Issued last night by the
Agricultural Department. The bulletin showed
none of the hoped-for improvements In the con
dition of winter wheat, upon which, the sto:k
market has been acting, and the effect of the
high average condition of spring wheat was
more than offset by the large decrease in acre
age, causing a large falling off in the indi
cated spring wheat crop from that of laet year.
With continued lack of rain In some portions
of the cotton belt the Influence of the crop
news could not be called beneficial upon stock
values. The dominant importance of the corn
crop this year was thus emphasized, and it Is
considered likely that this Importance will gain
force from this time forward. The argument
â¢was lueard that an increase in the dividend on
St. Paul is likely for the analogy of the In
crease in Chicago and Northwestern dividend.
The strength of Missouri Pacific caused a re
newal of old rumors that the long-expected
plan for the consolidation of the Gould railroad
Interests Into one corporation was being per
fected. No warrant for either, of these reports
could be secured In any quarter. The coalers
were neglected, but were firm, owing to the
current assertion that the striking miners
were likely to yield the contest soon. Noth
ing more was heard of plans for a compro
mise of the contest. Call money was easy and
In abundant supply, notwithstanding' some in
creased demand for stock market purposes, but
rates for time loans are firmly held. Rather
than make concessions to place, money on time,
bankers prefer to keep their funds In call
loans where they are easily accessible for any
future increase In the rates for time loans.
The stock market closed dull and Irregular.
Bonds were strong and higher. Total sales,
fl,900,000. United States bonds were all un
changed on the last call.

? Â¦
* CHICAGO, June 11. â Other speculative mar
kets had to drop back and give wheat place
to-day. A good array of bullish Influences was
at work. Â¦ Cables were higher and there was
strength in the renewal of wet weather In the
Central and Northwestern States, but most im
portant was the Government crop report. This
document placed the June condition of wheat
at 70.1, as compared with May's 76.4, when
an even 80 had been expected, and the spring
whea.t area was reduced^ by 2,511,000 acres
from last year. Northwestern receipts were
email, and although there seemed to be no
effect on that score early. Minneapolis even
tually led the bulge with sharp advances.
There was an increased volume of outside busi
ness, largely on the buying side. France was
bidding for stuff and the cable strength from
Liverpool was largely due to the bullish French
situation. July wheat opened %@V4c to %@%c
up at 71%@71%c, and quickly â¢ mounted to
72%c. Liquidation for profits was in order and
prices tumbled back to 71%c, but closed strong
and firm, %@%c higher; at 71%c. Much of
the buying was of the best character. â¢ . ..
Corn showed good early strength when all
markets were on the upturn. Support was
necessary, * howeveri â¢ when wheat broke.
Weather conditions favored better prices, as
did the smaller receipts. July closed firm, %c
i Oate were firm. July closed %c up, at 39%c.
Part of .the looked- for reaction, after the
persistent manipulation of provisions by pack
ers, came to-day. After yesterday's remark
able advance of 37%c for July ribs the Inside
crowd led by the packers, unloaded on the
fhorts' and a break of 37%c followed. Com
mission houses advise their clients that the
etuff is topheavy, but at the same time they
Bay the packers can put the price anywhere
that suits their Interests. July pork closed
2%c lower, lard a shade down and ribs 37%c
lower.

with higher Liverpool and Paris futures.
Chicago was dull, featureless and unsettled,
rising from 71%o to 72%c and falling back to
71%c. Local shorts covered July, owing largely
to the strength in Minneapolis, where the shorts
are 'in a dangerous position., Brokers who usu
ally buy for the Southwestern trade were sell
ers of September. I . â¢
The Government crop report appears in the
first column. It gives the condition of winter
wheat at 76.1 and of spring wheat at 95.4.
. This market was steady, with a slight im
provement in futures.

W heat and Other Grains,
of the receipts came to hand in poor condi
tion, owing to the warm weather In the coun
try. . Choice offerings sold readily at full fig
ures and a few chests of Longworths and Ma
lindas commanded a small premium over the
quotations. There was " but little demand for
Loganberries, some being, sold as low as $4
per chest. Currants were unchanged.
Choice offerings of black Cherries in cartons
from San Jose continued to find ready sale at
75c pe.r carton. Other varieties were easier,
although prices showed little variation.
Apricots are steadily declining under ' In
creasing receipts. Green Apples. Pears and
Peaches sell slowly at the quotations. Apri
cots In baskets from 'the river were offering
at CSigOOc per basket. |
Figs Â¦ and Melons from Yuma : stood about
the same. Ten bxs of choice black Figs were
received from Palm Springs and were offering
at $2 50 per box, but came in too late to be
sold.
There was no auction sale of Oranges yes
terday and the receipts In the open market
were very light. Fancy Oranges were In lim
ited supply and the top quotations were read
ily obtained. The market Is almost bare of
Lemons and Grape Fruit. Owing to the scar
city or Lemons the demand for Limes .was bet
ter and prices advanced. m
The Government fruit crop report, giving a
less favorable outlook â¢ in , a number of States,
appears In ' the first ' column.

A circular for ' Australia says : "Coal ar
rivals since the steamer Sonoma left are as
follows: Alice McDonald. 840 tons; West
gatl, 2345 tons; Albyn, 3221 tons; Sea King,
2195 tons; total. 9101 tons. There are twelve
coal carriers ; that are fully due here In the
next thirty days. The chartered list of coal
vessels foots up thirty-four in number, with a
carrying capacity of about 02,000 tons. For
tunately for the- Importers of these cargoes
fully 90 per cent of the coal had already been
disposed of, as it would be very difficult to
make re-sales to-day at the same prices at
which they have â¢ been â¢ contracted for. It is
singular that the loading list continues so
large, in view of the fact that it Is with dif
ficulty that a cargo can be sold, on .arrival
here, at . its Importation cost. In the bids re
cently made for coal supplies for the Govern
ment transports Australian grades were marked
down to very low ; figures. The contract haa
not yet been awarded. Fuel Oil continues to
make inroads among steam* consumers, which
makes the outlook for the future peculiarly
discouraging. Reports Are being generally dis
seminated that a . number of . our ocean-going
steamers are about being- remodeled, sq as to
discontinue the .further use of coal.- Some
of our wholesale dealers are meditating reduc
ing the sizes of - thetr. plants here' locally, as
the real estate being utilized by them has
become _very valuable within the past few
years." .

000 acres .or upward in this product that re
ports an Increase. There is a reduction of 745,
0iÂ»0 acres in Minnesota, end of 905.000 acres
In North Dakota, due largely to unfavorable
weather conditions during sowing time in Red
River Valley; a reduction of 400.00M acres In
South Dakota, resulting in the main from an
increasing tendency toward a greater diver
sification of crops and a reduction of 340.003
acres in Nebraska, consequent upon that grad
ual yielding of spring wheat to winter wheat,
which is going on in almost every section of
the State. The average condition of 6pring

92 nt same date last year. 87.5 on June 1. 1900.

ward in spring wheat. South Dakota reports
a condition of 100. North Dakota 06, and Min
nesota and Iowa 95>. In Washington and Ore
gon, which together have over 1,100.000 acres
in spring wheat, the condition averages are 97
and 93 respectively. The average condition of
winter wheat on June 1 was 76.1. as compared
with 76.4 on May 1, 1002; 87.8 on June 1, 1901;
K2.7 on June 1. 1000, and 80.3. the mean for
June average for the last ten years. Dur
ing the month cf May there was a gain of
'US points in Michigan. Illinois and Kansas, of
1 point in Indiana. 2 point* in Nebraska and
7 in Oklahoma. On the other hand, there was
a loss of 2 points in California and 3 in Penn
sylvania, with no measurable changes la Ohio.
Acreage reported as under barley exceeds
acreage harvested last year by 8.5 per cent.
In States having 100,000 acres or upward de
voted to this crop, there is an increase of area
amounting to 1 per cent in Kansas, S in South
Dakota. Washington and California, 8 per cent
in Minnesota and !Â¦."> per cent in North Dakota.
The ten-year averages are exceeded by 2 points
in Washington. 4 in Minnesota and Iowa, 5 in
California. C In North Dakota and South Da
kota and 10 in Wisconsin, while New York and

WOHLENBERG â In Baden, June 10, 1902,
Max ChristODher Henry .Wohlenberg, a na-
3 tlve of San Francisco, aged 28 years 11
months and 25 days.Chief Wittman took occasion to define
his position regarding all nickel-in-the
slot machines when the cases of two sa
loon-keepers were being heard, charged
with having machines .that paid money.
The Chief declared that all nickel-ln-the
slot machines â¢ which paid money, drinks
or cigars were Illegal under the Penal
Code, and expressed his willingness to
suppress them. The commission listened
to his remarks in silence and gave no
sign as to whether they indorsed his re
marks.
"It is a serious matter," said the Com
missioner. "This man is charged with a
grave offense, and I should want to be
positive as to his guilt before, I .would
take from him his livelihood. It would
be very wrong to stigmatize him with
conviction should he be the victim of mis
apprehension." "
The charge of extorting money made
against Officer . Cleveland Peters . was
promptly dismissed. The complainant In
the case and the only witness against
Peters "jumped" his ball In a case pend
ing against him and left the city.
Six new policemen were appointed by
tho Commissioners and will be sworn in
by Chief Wittman this morning. They
are Michael Whelton, John S. Barrett,
Paul D. Elmer, Charles J. Ward, Andrew
J. Goran and Daniel J. Kohane. They will
not fill vacancies, but will be paid from
a surplus that exists in the police funds.
In discussing the gallant conduct of Po
liceman . Keys in stopping a runaway
team and saving two women from serious i
injury two weeks ago, the lack of some
means to properly recognize meritorious
acts by officers was commented on by the
members of the commission. Commis
sioner Howell was finally appointed a
committee of one to devise some By stem'
of commemorating acts of exceptional
bravery by policemen by the bestowal of
medals or otherwise, as may seem best.
In voting to " acquit Levings of the
charges Commissioner Howell stated that
ho could not quite convince himself as to
the guilt of the defendant, and not wish
ing to do him an injustice would vote to
retain him on the force. Â»; ; " '
Levings was accused of soliciting &
bribe in the case of Carothers, alias Me
Â¦Williams, charged with grand larceny.
; The conversation regarding the bribe was
alleged to have occurred at the home of
Mrs. Elizabeth Darling, 913 Eddy street.
Two witnesses, Including an attorney, tes
tified in corroboratlon of Mrs. Darling's
statement that they had heard Levings'
request for $150 with which to "square"
the case.* The transaction was interrupt
ed, they claimed, by their appearance on
the scene.. Considerable difficulty was ex
perienced by the Commissioners in secur
ing the testimony of Mrs. Darling, and
although the action was brought some
time ago the testimony of the defense
could not be introduced until last Monday
afternoon. ,
The charge of soliciting a bribe brought
against Police Officer Leroy Levings was
dismissed by the Board of Police Commis
sioners last night. Two of the Commis
sioners, Mahoney; and Hutton, voted , to
dismiss Levings from the force, while
Commissioners Newhall and Howell voted
to exonerate him of the charge. Â«
Six Policemen Are Appointed

The offender led the policeman a long
chase because, as he explained, he did

Assistant City. Attorney LanÂ© has filed
an opinion with the Supervisors, setting
forth that the municipality, under the
law, may operate a railroad for five con

the ferry . up : Market . street to Sutter
was not â¢ conveyed, leaving two corpora
tions still on that part of Market street,
does not in his: opinion prevent the city
from using the ; street concerned for any
distance whatever. He holds . that the
use of the street, by the municipality
Itself -is not making a "grant to one
other . corporation," or making a grant
to any one, .and that the city Is war
ranted in claiming the right to proceed
for five blocks continuously upon all 'and
each of the streets concerned In thÂ©
Sutter-street and. Geary-street franchises.

It is assumed that transfer arrangements of
mutual benefit can be made with corporations
operating other street railway systems. The
city system should be established as sup
plemental to the roads operated under fran
chises and should not be laid out with a view
toward reducing their earnings. "With such
transfer privileges to some line reaching the
Third and Townsend street railway station in
view the originally suggested Second street line
is to be considered unnecessary at this time.
The cost for the railroad from the park to
the ferry would be $850,000: cost from the
park along Geary t,o Market street $700,000;
cost from Fulton on Tenth avenue to Point
Lobos avenue, thence to Geary, Grant avenue
Bush, Kearny and Pine streets to Market
street. $780,000. - -ra3Â«BMCi
TRANSFER ARRANGEMENTS.
The route of the proposed road Is to be
either of the following: Commencing at Ful
ton street on Tenth avenue, thence along Tenth
avenue to Point Lobos avenue, thence along
Geary street to Market street and thence along
Market street to the ferry depot; or com
mencing at Fulton street on Tenth avenue,
thence along Tenth avenue 'to Point Lobos ave
nue, thence along Point Lobos avenue to Geary
street, thence along Geary street to Grant ave
nue, thence along Grant avenue to Bush street.
thence along Bush street to Kearny,
thenca along Kearny street to Pine,
thence along Pine street to * Market and
thence along Market street to the ferry depot.
If the Municipal Street Railway system bo
restricted to a line from the ferries to the Park,
the location of a power house at the northern
water front of the city would not be Justified.
The economic location will then be about mid
way between the road terminals, or about in
the position of the present Geary street power
house. This location has, therefore, been as
sumed as a basis for the cost estimate under
this resolution (Project 1). The building there
to be erected will serve not only as a power
house but also as a car house.
The committee's recommendation has been
favorably acted upon by the Board of Super
visors and has ' resulted in the adoption of
resolution N%>. 2501 which requests the Board
of Public Works, through the City Engineer,
to prepare "plans and estimates of the cost of
the original construction or reconstruction and
completion of the Geary Street Railroad as a.
municipal electrical road with underground
power, flat rails and the most improved elec
trical apparatus and equipment known to
science."
ADOPTS RESOLUTION.
The studies for these extensions had already
been made when the whole matter of the con
version of the Geary street road into an under
ground electric system was again taken up by
the Public Utilities Committee of the present
Board kit Supervisors, and the conclusion was
reached by that committee that the road con
struction should be confined to a line from, the
ferries at the foot of Market street to the
Park.
City Engineer Grunsky filed his report
yesterday with the Publio Utilities Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors with
regard to supplemental estimates of cost
of an extension of the Geary-street road
from Tenth avenue to the ocean. It is
suggested that the extension should be
either along and just within the northerly
line of Golden Gate Park or along C
street. The grading along C street would
cost only about one-third . as much 'as
that along D street.
With regard to an extension into Sunset
district the chief engineer says:
It was found feasible to cross Golden Gate
Park practically on the line of Nineteenth ave
nue. In carrying out this project it would be
necessary to cross the main park drive, the
boat house road and the south drive on bridges,
leaving the roads and paths of the park, ex
cept the roadway entrance at Nineteenth ave
nue unobstructed by the street car tracks. The
track location would be just west of Stow
Lake. This branch of the system should, for
a time at least, terminate at Ocean avenue.
CITY ENGINEER
FILES REPORT
There Is , some talk that the action of
the grand president in instituting Gene
vieve Parlor will again be j, brought Into
court, and that papers for that purpose
are being drawn up. I
With the money thus , raised a - pair of
diamond earrings was purchased ' for the
grand president at a cost, it Is said, ; of
$250; then the sum of $100 was paid for
rooms at the Berkshire in which to main
tain, headquarters for the â¢ grand presi
dent, something never before done, and
in addition a large number of gold pins
were secured at a cost of $2 each to pre
sent to each delegate and grand officer
with which to pin on badges, and then to
be retained by those who received them
as a souvenir of the parlor session. '
This, it is said, was a~ part of a- scheme
to win over the delegates from the inte
rior to a plan to defeat Miss Keith for
the office of president, which; according
to' a long established custom, she ' would
fill by promotion, and to defeat - Miss
Laura J. Frakes, the grand secretary,
who is a candidate for re-election, because
she is a friend of the grand vice presi
dent. Â¦%Â«** .... . . â¢.
JEWELRY . IS BOUGHT.
The matter of entertaining the grand
officers and delegates I has also been a
matter of considerable talk In- the order,
the entertainment committee in various
ways sought to raise a certain amount of
money with which 'to entertain. There
were days at the Chutes,; a bazaar,-thea
ter party and entertainment,' and then
there was an appeal to the local-; parlors
of the Native Sons, many of which con
tributed from . $10 to $25 Â¦ toward â¢â¢â¢, the en
tertainment fund, and an attempt: was
made to force an assessment of 60 cents
per capita on each parlor of the Native
Daughters; but that was resisted on the
ground that there was no .authority to
levy such an assessment. Â¦ Some of the
parlors were even told that if it was not
paid the members would be suspended
from benefits. -.Â¦Â¦Â« â¢
This aroused . the curiosity of many of
the interior â¢ delegates, <who' axe not ac
quainted with the facts and wanted ; to
know them. ; :- â¢
The members continued to vote and
there were cast more black cubes than
were required under the constitutional
provision. The grand president and a
number of her friends then quietly had
the prospective members of the new par
lor notified to meet in Barton's Hall on
Clay street where the parlor was secret
ly Instituted, while a Sheriff's officer was
looking, for the grand; president to serve
an injunction on her. The matter came
up in court, but the real - issue was â¢ not
touched upon, on the ground that a civil
court could not interfere until the parties
in interest had exhausted all the . rights
which the order granted and it was de
clared that the matter 1 would have to be
decided in the Grand Parlor before any
other steps could be -taken. The matter
rested until Monday last, when a 'local
parlor issued a circular, which was dis
tributed to the delegates..- It was a state
ment of the case of the Organization of
Genevieve Parlor. Â¦ ;
SECRETLY INSTITUTED.
the organization of "Genevieve Parlor."
The members asked for a stay before
taking a vote, which was granted, and
when it was presented a second time the
parlor commenced to vote upon it, but
before one-half of the members had voted
the petition was taken from the desk and
carried out of the room.
THE many friends of R. Van
Brunt, the well known clubman,
mining expert and former man
ager of Lily Langtry's California
stock farm, will be pained to
learn that he is suffering from ; strange
hallucinations. It is thÂ© intention of his
old associates to place him in a private
sanitarium.
For the past six weeks Van Brunt has
shown signs of mental failing. He first
Imagined that he won an enormous for
tune on the Brooklyn handicap, when the
mare Relna came first under the. wire at
odds of 50 to 1. He now presents a pa
thetic figure in the corridors of the Pal
ace Hotel, pacing up and down the ro
tunda with a quick nervous step and
downcast eyes. Although Van Brunt has
an extensive wardrobe, he has not re
sorted to it for several weeks. He seldom
shaves, and he wears a straw hat that
has seen service for many years. Per
suaded by friends, he recently took a trip
to the country, but returned yesterday in
a worse condition. He visited the Palace
and informed his friends that in the fu
ture they must address him as Lord Rut
ledge. He explained that he had for
warded through his bankers in England
Â£15,000 to Queen Alexandra to defray- her
expenses at the coronation of King Ed
ward. For this generous act, he said, he
had bSen created a Lord by King Edward
and invited to act as master of ceremonies
at Westminster Abbey. Van Brunt also
imparted the startling information that
he had won Â£30,000,000 when Ard Patrick
won the English Derby. . < â¢ . .
An effort was made to persuade Van
Brunt to go to a private sanitarium for
a rest, but he declared that he was per
fectly well. It is expected that Dan
Murphy of San Jose will take charge of
Van Brunt and see that he receives
proper care and treatment at some sani
tarium.
\an Brunt comes from one of the old
The trouble arose from the fact that
when a certain number of members with
drew from La Vespero Parlor and sought
to organize another parlor in South San
Francisco there was opposition in a
marked degree from La Vespero Parlor
and Mrs. Gett, then Grand President, was
unable to organize a parlor with the se
ceding membership. Then Mrs. Baker,
the present Grand President, undertook
to organize it and started with a petition
from parlor to parlor to obtain consent,
for to organize a new parlor the consent
of a certain number of parlors must be
obtained, and further the constitution
provides that If a stated number of black
cubes are cast against the petition the
parlor cannot be Instituted. The petition
was first presented to a number of par
lors as coming from "Genevieve Baker
Parlor," and when it was presented to La
Vespero Parlor that body refused to act
upon It at that meeting. The last ..parlor
to which it was presented was Minerva
Parlor, â¢which was known to be opposed
to giving consent, but when it was pre
sented the word "Baker" was scratched
out and it was presented as a petition for
CIRCULATE PETITION.
The ground for the opposition to the
delegates named was that Genevieve Par
lor was not legally organized under the
constitution of the order. An effort was
made, in the first place, to refer the mat
ter to a committee on arbitration, and had
that been adopted objection would have
been made to the grand president naming
the arbitrators, because she is an inter
ested party; then an effort was made to
refer it to a committee of the whole,
when the entire matter could be brought
up and fully discussed, but that was com
bated by known and unknown parliament
ary law, and the motion was ruled out of
order; then a motion was made that, as
the order is an incorporated body, attor
neys be permitted to enter the hall and
discuss the matter from a legal stand
point; but that motion was also lost. A
dozen different methods. were suggested,
but In each Instance the party that evi
dently did not want to have the matter
gone into succeded in voting down every
proposition looking toward that end. At
last the matter was referred to the com
mittee on state of the order, and In spite
of all objections presented the two dele
gates were seated. The debate lasted
from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until a
quarter to 6, and the discussion waxed
warm.
DELEGATES ABE SEATED.
Mrs. Baker's faction had Frank H.
Dunne ready to answer a telephone mes
sage, and Miss Keith's adherents had
George D. Collins in waiting nearly all
day in the office of the superintendent of
the building. . .
The announcement was made some time
ago that the present session of the Grand
Parlor of the Native Daughters of the
Golden "West was to be the most exciting
that the order has ever known. The
events of the last two days are bearing
out that statement. On the opening day
the first manifestation of an inharmo
nious session made Itself apparent. When
the committee on credentials was present
ed there camÂ© the first wave of discord. It
Â¦was an objection to receiving the report
as presented, the objection coming from a
representative of Minerva Parlor, who
was opposed to seats being given in the
Grand body to Blanche Peguellion and
Agnes Troy, delegates from Genevieve
Parlor. There are two factions In the
Grand body, one known as the party that
supports the present grand president,
Mrs. Baker, and the other that supports
Miss Keith, the grand vice president. It
was expected that there would be some
thing of a tangle that would require the
assistance of men learned in the law to
unravel, and each side had an attor
ney within call.
.Tne nomination for officers, which ac
cording to a law oassed at the previous
cession of the Grand Parlor should have
been made at the first Jay's session, was
postponed until to-day.
In the latter part of the afternoon the
reports of the deputy grand presidents
were read, after which there was an ad
journment until this morning. The dele
gates were treated to oyster loaves fur
nished by the committee on entertaln
rn^nt.
In the evening the delegates and a num
ber of the grand officers went in a party
to the Alcazar.
The reports of the grand secretary and
of the grand treasurer were also read, and
these, with that of the gand president,
â¢were referred to the committee on state
of the order.
At the afternoon session the report of
the grand president was read. It was a
iengthy document. That official reports
the order in a satisfactory condition; that
five new parlors, namely, Monte Robles at
Ban Mateo, Mauna Loa at Port Jones, Las
Torrosas at San Francisco, Genevieve at
San Francisco, Alta Alles at Loyalton
and Imogene at Sierraville, had been in
stituted during the year; that Wlnona
Parlor at Arcata, Liberty at Vallejo and
Golden Bar at Sierraville had been reor
ganized, and that Alaxneda Parlor had
surrendered its charter; that Bonita, San
Jose, Princess, Los Pimlentos and Los
Angeles parlors had each made such a
gain in membership during the year as to
entitle each to an additional delegate to
the Grand Parlor. It was recommended
that there be more public Installations,
more open meetings and district meetings
in localities where there are two or more
parlors, once In three months, and that
the wild poppy be adopted as the emblem
of the order. - . -
Miss Russell and Miss Burke were ap
pointed as assistants to the great secre
taries. Emma Greuber Foley was ap
pointed grand marshal In place of Har
riet Lee, and Tlllie Brobacka was ap
pointed grand organist.
During the noon recess the delegates
were entertained by Alta, Oro Flno, Las
Lomas and Calaveras parlors.

How We Do It.
So we confided with a big German maker. He was quick
to catch the Yankee spirit. Said that if we would let him
use his odd time he would turn us out a special glove.
He was glad of a chance to keep his plant going. He
was careful about the skins, how they. were tanned and

He too was after a bigger trade. Both of us pulling
together have developed a wonderful bargain.

; in my store. The 'phone is free and
you're welcome. If your shirt sleeves
are too long, come in and I'll fix 'em.
If you want to see the directory,
come and welcome. These favors
cost nothing and make me friends.
I want.to be accommodatingâ so
by asking a favor you 1avor me,
i Will I see you to-day? Perhaps I
I can sell you some neckwear, a shirt
j or two and some collars.
