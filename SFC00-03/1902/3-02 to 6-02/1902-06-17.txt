CALL- BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON,* June 16.â Following
an announcement from the. White House
to-day that President Roosevelt had made
his last effort for Cuban reciprocity when
he sent / his special message to Congress,
the so-called ".administration Senators"
late to-night gave up the fight and con
fessed defeat on this, the greatest meas
ure of the session.
On|y the, obsequies remain. A bill will
be preparedfor fcurial by the Republican
members of the Committee on Relations*
with Cuba to-morrow. The wake will be
held at the Republican conference in the
marble room of the Senate on Wednesday.
The only remaining effort to be made will
be to shjf t the blame on Senators who
have openly opposed the bill, and to hold
them -up to the public as the real offend
ers. It is no secret, however, that the real
cause of this unhappy plight in which the
Republican party, finds itself lies deeper
than the open opposition of the "Boxers."
BEATEN BY COMBINE.
'In a long conversation to-night one of
th'e President's close friends in Congress
stated that the finishing blow, had been
dealt to this bill by three members of the
Cabinet; by the Republican National
Committee, through almost all its mem
bers; by a secret opposition of pretended
friends of the President in the Senate; by
the disclosures by F. B. Thurber; by the
early hostility of Speaker Henderson and
Representatives Payne, Dalzell and Gros
venor. ; - ; - '..
This was a combination that no" Presi
dent, however great and persistent, could
beat, and It. was only after a thorough
realization by the President and his real
friends that defeatand disaster were ad
mitted: r The - admission . came from the
c White' ilteu.se â¢ in a v seml-o2HciaL'irmSunce-J :
I'irierit" this -afternoon in these words:'
' ."'-'it is now pretty clearly understood. that
the President' has done all he is going to
do as to ; reciprocity.' legislation. He is
through" with conferences and does not In
tend to follow, his recent special message
jwith further action" of any kind. He does
not feel that the defeat of reciprocity
would be a defeat of his own proposition,
and therefore he has no particular pride
or ambition^ . .
MAY NEGOTIATE TREATY.
President., Palma. of Cuba has Indicated
to". President' Roosevelt his conviction that
the 'rebate' proposition relative v to CufJan
sugar would be not only very objection
able-in itself, but would be extremely ex
pensive and almost impossible to carry
out In the distribution.
It is not stated how this proposition
wa3 communicated /to President Roose
velt, but it is assumed that- Secretary
Hay was the medium, having been ac
quatnte I by Senor Quesada, the Cuban
Minister, with President Palma's position
on this ' subject.
'.When it becomes apparent that there is
no possibility of an agreement between
tho Senate and the House upon the pend
ing reciprocity proposition, the President
probably will endeavor to simplify the
problem- by dropping the- House out of
the calculations and negotiating directly
with President Palma. It is true such a
treaty, would require the approval of two
thirds of the Senate, but it Is believed
that under the changed conditions this
Â¦would not be, impossible of' attainment.
PAYMENTS TO GOMEZ.
i Secretary i Root has assumed full re
sponsibility for the payment of money to
General Gomez by General Wood during
the : American, occupation of Cuba, and If
Congress asks j for j an explanation of tho
matter : he stands prepared to furnish
what. he r regards as the most convincing
proofs that 'the payments were dictated
by; the wisest statesmanship.
. At the War Department a high official
stated the position of the department iu
tlie matter as follows:
The conditions In Cuba two years ago wera
precarious..' }Jot a' Cuban believed that the
United' States Government ever "would with
draw: from Cuba, and the half- famished vet
erans.' of the Cuban army were In a dangerous
mood r and â¢clamorins for their pay. General
Gomez was the bead and front of their army
and had served the revolutionary cause as its
principal leader without having received a
cent of pay.. General Wood thought, and Sec
retary Hoot thought afterward, that General
Gomez was â¢ entitled : to compensation; to a
home which was supplied him and In which he
entertained his comrades, and to an Income,
which , last .might be j^et down as~a small
offset to the money due Gomez from the Cuban
republic. . That', the Cubans themselves 're
garded the .matter in the same- light was
shown . by the ,' passage ' by the present Cuban
Congress, , amons the very first of Its acts, of
a bill' providing. a. liberal pension for General
Gomez. It . is believed ' that but for this as
sumption .of the- costs of Â¦ Gomez's living' ex
penses, the conditions- in Cuba must have par
alleled those In the Philippines, and the United
States -Government, after. -fighting SDaln to

SUISUN, June 16.â Grasshoppers are
devastating the orchards In the neighbor

land has been burned over to destroy the

having the" grass burned from their land
and a special meeting of the Board of Su

action. Great loss will result unless
strenuous measures are adopted to de

William Morris, a member of the citi
zens' posse from here, was brought to the
hospital with his thigh shattered by a
rifle ball fired by a member of the party
from Portland.- Morris and a companion
were watching a bridge across . Salmon
Creek when they were mistaken for the
convicts by another person a quarter of
a mile away. Two shots were fired and
Morris fell wounded. He was sitting in
a crouching position and the ball struck
him in the front part of the thigh, crush
ing the bone. It is believed to-night that
the limb will have to be amputated. Mor
ris has a wife- and several small children.
The country surrounding Peedy's cabin
and the roads in the vicinity were thor
oughly patrolled by officers, and Sheriff
Marsh is convinced that the convicts re
mained in hiding in a strip of timber sur-.
rounding the cabin to-day. : -^

be resumed in earnest to-morrow.-* . In the
meantime it would not be surprising to
many persons if the convicts .should at
tempt to reach the house of Merrill's rela

officers upon the house in which a half
brother and stepfather of the outlaw live.-

Peedy says the convicts talked inces
santly while in his cabin, telling him they
were Tracy and Merrill. A pair of shoes,
from which the soles were almost worn
away, a pair of overalls with several
inches of one leg gone, a coat stolen from
Dr. "White at. Gervals and two old hats
were found in Peedy's cabin by Sheriff
Marsh and the detectives.
Shortly before 8 o'clock, while I waa still in
bed. I heard a loud Taj> on my door. I got up
and opened the door end was confronted by
two men carrying rifles. They ordered me to
stand aside, which I did. They entered and
then shoved me down on the bed and tied my
bands and feet. They "built a flre In my, stove
and fried some baccn and ate breakfast, after
which they cooked all the bacon In the house,
about five or six pounds, and put it. with what
bread I had. into a sack. Each of the men
put on a suit of my clothing, a hat and a pair
of shoes, leaving their cast-off garments in my
cabin.
Before leaving they asked me If I had any
money and proceeded to search my pockets,
finding ?5. They then put a gag In my mouth
and went away, locking the door behind them,
saying they would send some one to release me
in a short time. 1 managed to free myself after
hard work.
LOSES AI/Ii HIS BACON.
Peedy, in relating his experience with
Tracy and Merrill, said: Â« .
After going a short distance from Pee
dy's cabin, Tracy and Merrill stopped and
changed their clothing for that they had
stolen. The'discarded garments, including
their prison shoes, were found by mem
bers of the posse later in the day. Among
the garments found' were several taken
from Dr. White, who was held up by the
convicts in Marion County. Thl3 makes
it certain that the posse is after the right
men
Tracy and Merrill appeared at the cabin
of a rancher named Peedy, about four
miles back of Vancouver, at 6:S0 o'clock
this morning 1 , bound- and -gagged him, and
stole his clothing and some loose gar
ments which were. In the cabin. Then they
went. away, leaving Peedy lying on the
floor. He was found by passers-by an
hour later and told his story.

his assailant 34.
Reyburn and Kutzman were wood chop
pers on the ranch of John O'Hara, in
Bennett Valley, about nine miles from
this city. They had been friends for some
time, but yesterday after both had been
drinking, a petty quarrel precipitated
trouble. According to Reyburn's -story,
Kutzman was. very intoxicated and was
the aggressor. Reyburn's statement . is
substantiated^ by that of John McKnight,
a wood chopper, who witnessed the affray.
Kutzman is alleged to have advanced on
Reyburn with a heavy picket, and at
tempted to strike him. The blow was
warded off. by the left hand of Reyburn
and the fracture of the wrist ' resulted. -
The next blow struck Reyburn on the left
Bide of the face. This felled Reyburn and
Kutzman dropped his club and began to
choke his victim. Reyburn managed to,
draw a knife from his pocket and with
this weapon gave his assailant Â¦ what is
believed to be his death wound; In ad
dition to the three wounds in the lung,
six wounds were inflicted on the left side
of Kutzman.

Owing to the fact that the Yaqui ris
ing has created such a disturbance and
many of the rurales have joined the
forces in the field, life is becoming unsafe
in Sonora. Many outlaws who have been
kept down by the forces of Colonel Kos
terlltsky have again taken to the highway
and frequent instances have been , recorded
within the past three weeks where Amer
icans have been murdered. For this rea
son, Americans who have ranch and min
ing Interests in Sonora are in hopes that
Torres will be able to put down the Ya
quis in short order.
When they were overtaken by the posse
a running fight ensued. The pursuing
party numbered five when it caught up
with the murderers, all of the rest having
dropped out. One murderer fell dead soon
after the firing commenced and the other
was riddled with bullets a quarter of a
mile farther on. One of. the posse re
ceived a slight wound. The dead men
were buried on the Â¦ spot.
BOTH MURDERERS. SLAIN.
The murderers were greatly fatigued,
having kept to the saddle the greater
part of the time since leaving the Ward
ranch. They had stopped at several
ranches, and, at the point of their rifles,
compelled the proprietors to give them
fresh horses. Although exhausted, they
resolved to sell their lives dearly. '
The " alarm ' was ' given by one of the
servants- and a posse composed of all of
the Americans on the ranch and the bal
ance of the Mexicans soon assembled.
There were ten in the party. After mak
ing Mrs. Ward comfortable they hastily
took the trail- of the murderers, following
about two hours behind them. ! The as
sassins had taken the steepest trails into
the mountains, but the pursuing party
was persistent, following them day and
night until yesterday afternoon, when
it came upon them at a point . about
fifteen miles east of Cuchuta, a little
station forty miles south of , Douglas,
Ariz., on the Nacozari Railroad. .
POSSE -TAKES THE TRAIL.
They procured rifles and returned about
an hour later. Ward again refused to set
tle on their terms and they opened flre.
â¢killing him instantly and mortally wound
ing his wife, who died the next day. After
committing the murder , they mounted
their horses. and. fled. , ' ':.
Ward had large landed interests on one
of the upper branches of the Yaqui River,
about thirty^ miles east of Cos. He em
ployed many Mexican and Yaqui laborers,
but the latter had all left to join the In
dian uprising. Ward had made, a contract
with the two Mexicans to do some work
on the ranch. The men became dissatis
fied with the contract, threw it up and
demanded their money for what they had
already done. Ward refused to pay them
until the work was completed, and the
Mexicans left, swearing vengeance.
TUCSON, Ariz., June 16.â R. M. Ward,
one of the most prominent American

were murdered last Friday. Two Mexi
cans who committed the crime were run
to earth and shot after a three days'
chase. Â¦ <

This indicates that Kilauea is not p.loruj
the seat of volcanic activity, but that the
fummit crater is flaming up as well. Cap
tain Mother of the steamer Noeau, who
brought the positive news here from Ha
waii of the outbreak at the volcano, saw
the reflection of volcano fires on Wednes
oay night, June 4, as his vessel lay at
anchor at Waipio. He supposed at that
time that tht- reflection was from. the tire
at Kilauea. but subsequent advices show
that it came from Mokuaweoweo.
Every indication points to a greater
violence In the volcanic disturbance, and
the past history of Kilauea gives reason
for the belief that the lava geysers will
>rive a continuous performance of indefi
nite . duration. The atmospheric condi
tions of the windward side of Hawaii are
nctiwably affected by some strange and
unusual interference, and even here in
Honolulu the air is dry, oppressive, calm,
and the stillness of pine woods reigns.
Neither mountain breeze nor sea breeze
seems capable of stirring the stagnant air.
Letters received from Waimea and the
Humuulu sheep ranch on Hawaii tell of
an outbreak of Mokuaweoweo, the sum
mit crater of Mauna Loa. On Saturday,
May 31, smoke and ashes were first seen
coming from Mokuaweoweo.' On Monday.
June 2. the smoke Â¦was still coming from
the crater and on the following days.
Tuesday and Wednesday, lire was also
breaking forth.
Word has been received from F. Wal
dron, the manager of the Volcano House,
that the volcano was a grand sight. He
says "lourists who rushed up from Hilo
Â¦were delighted." From the looks of things
St seems that we are to have an active
volcano for eome time to come. The later
displays at night are much better than
tbose of the first outbreak."
Within two days the lava had risen 600
feet in Halemaurnau, which is the active
pit situated at tiie bottom of Kilauea.
The sides of this crater were crumbling
into the pit. filling it up in places. Boil
ing Java had burst through over the floor
of the gTeat crater and the greatest ac
tivity continued as long as the steamer
was in communication with the residents
of Hawaii. . â¢
HONOLULU, June 10.â Further confir
mation "of the eruption at Kilauea^was
brought to this city, J^ine 7, by the steam
er Kiiiau. which arrived from Hilo. also
by the steamer Helcne. Both reports tell
of startling activity accompanied by a
iiow of lava.

."A few years ago I .yrcnt through a sur-
gical operation. After being in bed for
four months I was able to be up, but was
exceedingly weak and worn, nervous an<l
unable to sleep or eat. My physician pre-
scribed Paine's Celery Compound, and I
at once began to feel stronger. After
using a few bottles my health and
strength were completely restored, and I
ahi glad to give this testimonial in Its
favor."
The success of Paine's Celery Compound
in banishing the Ills and diseases that
fellow people Into" the summer time has
not been confined to any particular class
of society. Men esteemed In business and
professional life, mechanics, farmers,
women leaders in society, and the wives
and mothers of humble homes have all by
voice and pen contributed strong testi-
mony In favor of the medicine that re-
stored them to health and strength.
When Paine's Celery Compound Is used-
there is no more neuralgia, rheumatism,
dyspepsia, stomach derangements, liver or
kidney troubles. The. blood once foul and
stagnant Is made fresh and pure and
courses with a regularity that brings
vigor and happiness. The use of one bot-
tle is often sufficient to establish a health
robust enough to combat the dangers and
perils that are common In hot weather.
Mrs. A. T. Lermond. Chicago, 111.. Cor-

sought the lives of p'retty Cassie Clawson,
whose love for him had waned, and of the
young man who had proved a successful

to kill any one who crossed his path, and
it was declared by witnesses that he did

that, unknown to Yeakey, Cassie Claw

PRESIDENT ADMITS HIS DEFEAT.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., June 16.â The
sixth week of the anthracite coal miners'
strike began to-day without a ripple to
disturb the calmness of the situation.
The rain fell nearly all day, which helped
to keep the more than 150,000 men and
boys indoors. Several reports of assaults
on workingmen and coal and iron police
men were received from different sections
of the region. No one was seriously in
jured:
It was expected that to-day would wit
ness the refusal of a large number of fire
bosses and other mine bosses to go to
work, but the best information obtain
able shows that the number of men who
quit was not large. . However, President
Mitchell and other leaders assert that
nearly all of the men that were at. work
on Saturday refused to go into the col
leries to-day. ..'...-
Casper Clark of Toledo, president of the
International Team Drivers' Association,
came in for some attention by labor lead
ers to-day. He submitted to an interview,
in which he said his organization would
do what it could to help , the striking
miners.
There was a revival to-day of the story
that the Central Pennsylvania soft coal
miners would be called out very soon, but
President Patrick Gilay of the Central
Pennsylvania district reiterated what he
had said yesterday, that the Central
Pennsylvania men would not be called
out exceot as an extreme measure. He
thought "a curtailment of soft coal pro
duction in his district would be a more
likely action.

said, have already suggested to him that
the number of days' work be cut down,

BURNING BARK ABANDONED AT SEA
WINDSOR, England, June 16.â King
Edward arrived here at 6 p. m. from
Aldershot.
King Edward and Queen Alexandra
started for Windsor at 4:15 this afternoon
In a motor car. The King showed little
trace of his recent illness.
"King Edward caught a chill in the
stomach. He is much better, however,
although he will have to be careful. His
Majesty is also troubled with slight
pain."
Sir Francis Liking, physician in ordin
ary to the King, who has been in con
stant attendance upon his Majesty since
he became indisposed at Aldershot, is
pleased to get King Edward to Windsor
Castle, where he can receive better-atten
tion than at Aldershot.
King Edward lately has undergone
a regular course of massage for rheu
matism, which has troubled him as a re
sult of the bad weather. After arriving
at Windsor last evening his Majesty was
able to walk about the castle and receive
the guests whom he had Invited to a din
ner party. Those present at the dinner
included the Prince and Princess of
Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke
of Connaught, the Duke and Duchess of
Devonshire, the Duke and Duchess of
Portland, the Marquis and Marchioness
of Londonderry and other notable per
sons. â¢ ':-^y
No bulletin of the King's health has
been issued. His Majesty's physicians
are merely advising him to keep quiet
and to husband his strength as much as
possible. :
At Lloyd's yesterday there was a big
rise on the premiums on the King's life
and upon his chances of his being
crowned June 26.
ALDERSHOT, England, June 18.â The
Indisposition of King Edward and the in
cessant downpour of rain combined to
effectually spoil the. grand review of
troops here to-day. The King did not
leave the royal pavilion and was repre
sented by the Prince of Wales, who rode
to the saluting point, accompanied by the
Duke of Connaught and a brilliant staff,
comprising several Indian Princes, the
military attaches, Lord Roberts, the com
mander in chief, and the headquarters
staff. Queen Alexandra drove to the pa
rade ground in a closed carriage with the
Princess of Wale3 and the Princess Vic
toria. In other carriages at the saluting
point were the Duchess of Connaught and
many of the notabilities who ire visiting
England. More than 32,000 rain-soaked
troops marched past the heir to the
throne.
The Prince of Wales, conversing with
the Mayor of Windsor upon his arrival
here yesterday evening, said:

FAVOR TAFT'S PROPOSALS
After these formal exchanges the Presi
dent shook the Minister's hand warmly
and expressed to him with unmistakable
earnestness the deep gratification he felt
at being able to greet as the first Minis
ter from the new-born republic of Cuba
the man he had known as a personal
friend in previous years. The Minister re
sponded in the same unconventional man
ner.
Secretary Hay also had cause for grati
fication. He recalled the fact that to-day
mr.rked the culmination of his own efforts
for thirty years. Hay was first secretary
of legation at Madrid when General Dan
iel Sickles was United States Minister
there, and Hay had to do then with tho
proposition to purchase for 5100,000,000 the
island of Cuba. He did not abate his in
terest in the subject or relax his efforts
when opportunity served to bring about
the result achieved to-day, when Cuba's
first Minister was recognized by the Pres
ident of the great republic of the north.
Mr. Minister: It Is with great pleasure that
I receive from your hands the letter of his Ex
cellency, tho President of Cuba, accrediting
you as Envoy. Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary from Cuba to the United States,
and acknowledge the President's cordial greet,
ing. You may assure him that I shall emit
no opportunity to draw closer the special ties
of friendship and association which already
unite the people of the United States to the
republic of Cuba.
I cordially welcome you. Mr. Minister, to
this capital, and am confident that your resi
dence here will materially contribute to the
good relations which both Governments are
arxious to maintain.
. Mr. ' President: I have the high honor of
handing you the letter which accredits me near
your Government aa Envoy â¢ Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary of the republic of
Cuba. -It gives me pleasure to transmit to
your Excellency the most cordial greetings of
the President. Tomas Estrada. Palma, and his
fervent wishes for the continued welfare anÂ«l
prosperity of the United States. Faithfully In
terpreting the sentiments of the Cuban people,
it Is his desire that the relations between the
two countries, strengthened by new ties of
mutual commercial Interests, shall be every
day closer and friendlier, aa they should be In
any case, by reason of the noble and disinter
ested conduct of the American people.
My constant alrn. Mr. President, will be* to
do all that Js possible, in order that the har
mony and fraternity between the greatest na
tion of America and the youngest shall be as
lasting as will be eternal the cult for the
memory of those who shed their blood that
Cuba might be. as She is to-day, a free and
Independent nation.

decided change in sentiment it is not like
ly that the present aspect of the platform
will be changed. Other planks will be in

government in the Philippines, criticizing
the attitude of the party leaders on the

of the Federal courts in matters relating
to the revenue laws of Illinois, declaring
against government by injunction and fa-
The chances are, however, that Â¦ the
Kansas City platform, and with it the sil
ver issue, will be passed over in silence.
The advocates of their recognition ad
vance as their chief reason for insisting
upon a plank to that effect that the
avowed policy of the party in the last na
tional convention should not be thrown
aside. On the other hand, the opponents
of roa ffirmation insist that there is a pos
sibility of a party split if the plank is in
serted, and that the chance of this is too
great a price to pay for sentiment regard
ing issues that do not enter directly Into
the coming State campaign.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., June 16.â Whether
or not the Kansas City platform is to be
reaffirmed, and who will be the chairman
of the next State convention, are the
causes of possible friction in the Demo

the men turn a stream of water down the

of the fire were seen during the 2Sth, but
at 2 a. m. of May 29 the entire crew was
aroused by hearing a terrific puff followed
an instant later by a brilliant glare of
light. The pent up gases had finally
found an outlet through hatch No. 4 and
the ventilators. The hatch was sent fly
ing high above the jigger mast, while the
ventilators were sent so high that no fur
ther trace of theni was found. Then the
flames began to shoot into the heavens.
The fire leaped high into the rigging, go

from the after-hatch. The tongues of
flames leaped also from the ventilator
openings. For some minutes the flames
seemed to poise in midair and then the
fire subsided somewhat.

Ej>cclsJ Dispatch to The Call.
Many persons from the northern coun
ties . make the rough trip by .. wagon or
pack horse to Mount Lassen during the
summer to study the strange conditions
and Bights which it presents and there
has been, a belief for years ' among* those'
who know the peak that the internal fires
were not by any means extinct and might
cause a fresh eruption at any. time.
"They thnk that old Lassen Is about to
have fts head blown off ," replied the lum-,
berman, "and those .who don't have to
hang around there are doing just what
I'm doingâ they are going somewhere else
for their' health." " . :
"What do the people who are in the im
mediate vicinity think about it?" Hunter
asked.
But more ominous than the hissing
Bteam are the low rumblings which are
heard. They are described as sounding
like distant peals of thunder.
Fred E. Hunter has brought the latest
news from Lassen. On his journey to
Redding from Fall River Mills he was In
tercepted at Pawnee by a lumberman
hastening from the scene. This lumber
man was with a party of timber cruisers
who were working upon the mountain.
He declared -that the springs, many of
which, were cold formerly, are all throw
ing out boiling water now in a way to
make a close approach unsafe. ,"
REDDING, June 16.â Away to ths
southeast, more than fifty miles from
Redding, rug-ged Mount Lassen is giving
yet stronger evidence that the geologists
were correct when they declared that if
there were a one-time active volcano In
California which was not dead, but mere
ly slumbering, Lassen was that one.' From
a keen interest in the reports within', a
fortnight that new boiling springs had
begun to cloud the mountain sides with
steam, the more timid people of Redding
have passed to an actual fear at the lat
est news brought to-day by a 1 courier, to
the effect that the steam vents were
growing larger and that .away' down in
the crater the fire has set to rumbling.
At some spots even where there are . no
springs the ground is so hot as to make
walking upon it painful. . , . â¢ â¢

Ollndo Blanchini, who was stabbed by
Matteo Ftancheschimr in a restaurant
early yesterday morning, is doing well,
although his Injuries are very sqvere. It
was in a drunken" quarrel that Blanchnl
received. two. knife wounds in the region
of the heart. ; '
The wounded man claims that he was
shot without provocation by Lahore after
tu> (Lu Grange) had invited him to take
z. drink. He denies that he ever threat
ened Lahore with bodily harm.
Justin . La Grange, a laborer, who was
shot by Edward Lahore during a quarrel
in a saloon at 1341 Fifth avenue, South
San Francisco, is resting easily and the
iiidi cation's are that he will recover. The
two were employed at the fertilizing
works of Bayle, Lacoste & Co., and thero
has been a grudge between them for some
time past.- . Lahore says that La Grange
frequently Â¦ threatened to do him ! bodily
harm and- that when they met in the sa
loon Sunday evening both were, under the
influence of liquor. Lahore, says he has
no recollection of what followed, but be
lieves he was 'assaulted and that in the
melee he drew his pistol and fired at La
Grange. ' Lahore bears a* cut on his head
and nose and in other ways shows that he
was in a personal encounter with some
one at the time of the shooting.
The police say that Guadalupe has been
employed in Patrick's tannery. South San
Francisco, for the las.t eighteen years and
nas always borne a good character. ' ,
Guadalupe was taken, back to the City
Prison and will not be booked till De Suza
dies or is. pronounced out of danger. He
denies that he . knew that the revolver
was loaded, and says he snapped the trig
ger with 'the intention of scaring De
Suza. They had been "fooling" outside
the house, and it was after De Suza ad
dressed him as stated that he snapped the
trigger.' De Suza, who is a vaquero, has
teen put of employment for some time. -
Â¦"Â¦â¢ Believing I am about to die and having no
hope of recovery I make this as my dying
statement. This old man (pointing to Joseph
Guadalupe'*. my stepfather, was fooling around
the gun that was on the bureau. He took the
gun off the bureau, when I said to him: '"Shoot,
you are a coward; you are afraid to shoot. If
you did I would knock your block off." He
polntfd the gun at me, and bang, it went off.
He did not know it was loaded and he said:
â¢'My Cod, -I have shot my boy." We had no
trouble or quarrel of any kind up to the
shooting. It, was -an accident. arrest
him is all I ask. JAMES K. DE SUZA.
A series, of .tragedies kept thÂ» police
busy yesterday morning. Two of the vic
tims will recover, j but one is reported to
be fatally wounded. The latter is James
de Suza, who was shot at 1329 Fourteenth
avenue South by his stepfather, Joseph
Guadalupe. ':.Â£ j
The police ..were notified early in the
morning that Suza might die at any mo
ment at the County Hospital and Captain
Martin, sent Detectives Crockett and Fltz-
Eerald with Assistant Warrant Clerk
Flood to that Institution to take his ante
mortem statement.
When they reached the hospital with
Guadalupe, who was handcuffed, De Suza
said excitedly: "Take those oft my
father. I'don't want him arrested. Take
them off.V I say," and to calm him the
handcuffs were removed. Thereupon De
Suza made the following statement:

The amended motion was accepted by
Murdock and put to a vote by Chairman
Ohnimus, and the three Commissioners
voted in the affirmative.
McCalvy quickly left the room and went
to his desk In the Tax Collector's office.
Mre. Hydenfeldt stated after the trial
that but for her husband's absence in
Cape Nome criminal proceed! nj?s would
have been taken against McCalvy.
"I move to amend that," said Commis
sioner McCarthy, "by adding a request to
the Mayor that McCalvy be dismissed
from his. position."
McCalvy flatly refused to answer, and
when he was ordered to be sworn and
testify he again refused.
"I move that the name of George A.
McCalvy be stricken from the eligible list
of this commission," said Commissioner
Murdock.
"We have a note before -us," said Mur
dock, "which was given by Thor Hyden
feldt to Chief Examiner Moran. This
note purports to be in your handwriting,
McCalvy. The note Eays that the $100 for
which it Is security Is to be paid ' out of
your salary by this commission. Did you
or did you not sign and indorse this
note?"
The Commissioners finally became tired
of McCalvy's objections and sprung a
surprise on him. On motion of Commis
sioner Murdock all the evldencts was
stricken out and the matter disposed of
quickly.
McCalvy was impudent in his demeanor
to the commission and tried to prevent the
evidence of Chief Examiner Moran being
Introduced. Moran testified that McCalvy
had admitted to him that he had bor
rowed the money from Hydenfeldt and
had given the note as security.
The accused deputy evaded the issue by
a mass of flimsy legal technicalities. He
objected to the introduction of a deposi
tion made by Thor Hydenfeldt and to the
evidence of Mrs. Hydenfeldt. x -
Mrs. Hydenfeldt was badgered by Mc-
Calvy In cross-examination, and when lie
tried to introduce family affairs he was
sharply reprimanded by the Commission
ers. /
As the Civil Service Commission has no
control of salaries of the city and county
employes, the security given by McCalvy
to Hydenfeldt was worthless.
McCalvy conducted his own defense,
and his manner before the commission
did not benefit him. He objected to the
trial on the ground that Thor Hydenfeldt
was not present, being In Cape, Nome.
Mrs. Hydenfeldt testified that McCalvy
had borrowed $100 from herself and her
husband, giving as security a promissory
note. This note was indorsed by McCalvy
and authorized the holder to present the
same to the Civil Service Commission and
collect the amount from his salary.
George A. McCalvy, deputy tax collect
or, was tried by the -Civil Service Com
missioners yesterday jon a charge of ob
taining 5100 by false pretenses from Thor
Hydenfeldt, and the result of the pro
ceedings was that McCalvy's name was
stricken from the eligible list of civil ser
vice employes. Mayor Schmltr will also
be requested to dismiss McCalvy from his
official position. \
The Mayor's recommendation that the
board lease for a period of twenty years
a suitable room in the City Hall to the
five Grand Army posts of this city for
their accommodation at a nominal rental
ires referred to the Building Committee.
D'Ancona contended that the school
housea to be built should be designated
in the- ordinance, as he was opposed to
ffo&iff outside the dollar limit to build
schoolhousea In the outlying districts,
which he* did not consider an extreme
emergency. He held that the Board of
Education should 6pecify Its Intentions
with regard to the schoolhouses to be
built. The Committee on Education was
then delegated to confer with the Board
of Education on the subject, ascertain its
Intentions and report to the board next
Monday, when flnal action will be taken.
The Committee on Artificial Lights was
authorized to prepare contracts with the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
xo light the streets -for 329 nights during
the next fiscal year, which will make
three dark nights each month and give
the city the benefit of the rate of .0S7
cents per lamp per night, as agreed by
the company. The' gain to the city will be
Rbcut $tS00. as against the rates paid last
year. The game company must allow a
<liscount upon their bills for lighting
public bullcings equal to the reduced rate
paid by the most favored consumer, and
in this way & saving of $6S00 will be ef
iected. The committee recommends the
acceptance of the bids of both the San
SJYancisco Gas Company and Pacific Gas

THE United States army transport
Meade sailed yesterday for Ma
nila with eighty-four, enlisted
men, about fifty cabin passengers
and a heavy cargo of supplies for
the troops in the Philippines. She left the
dock about 2 o'clock and anchored in tlÂ«
stream for several hours , before sailing.
The delay was caused by the replacing of
the steam pipe that exploded on Saturday
with such disastrous results.
The enlisted men included eleven mem
bers of the signal corps, forty-five re
cruits and casuals and twenty-eight hos
pital corps men. The cabin passengers
included several school teachers and a
large number . of Government i employes.
Miss J.- Williams, a passenger, was booked
on the official passenger list as "fiancee
of a school teacher." Fred Hill.''Inspec
tor, of Philippine Constabulary, was a
passenger.
Among the military passengers were
Captain J. S. Powell, judge first instance;
Captain C. R. Trowbridge of the secret
rervlce, and Second Lieutenant Nelson
Johnson.. Captain Powell was accom
panied by, his wife and seven children.
Lieutenant Johnson is. the subaltern whe
ma<Je himself famous a few evenings ago
by giving a zem zem specialty at tha
Orpheum.

MUSIC CO.,
A man skilled in music
and musical, instru-
ments, who knows the
foibles of the business,
says that unqualifiedly
the Pommer-Eilers Music
Co. is serving the public
with more fairness than
is any other store in the
land.
We shou'd be glad to
have you come in and
see our stock of pianos
any time.
If you do not care to
pay all cash we will ex-
tend the most liberal
terms, as little down as
you please and as much
as you want to pay each
month. It is. really, un-
der present conditions,
cheaper for you to own
a piano than it is to rent
one.
There are some pianos
made to cheat with and
used to chsat with. We
will not cut the quality
to throw a bone to a
price. If you want a
good, honest, straight,
reliable pian?, made as
well as a piano can be
made, made to last and
go down through the
years a pleasure in the
home, we stand ready
to figure with you. If
you want a piano that
will give satisfaction
first, last and a!! the
time we stand ready to
figure with you. If you
want a piano that will
be an ornament to and
a joy in your home we
stand ready to figure
with you. By this we
mean to say that under
no circumstances or
conditions will we allow
ourselves to be under-
sold in price if you are
looking for an instru-
ment of quality. *t : .

NATIVE DAUGHTERS WILL
HAVE TO APPEAR IN COURT
\
Genevieve Parlor Matter Is to Be In-
vestigated in AH Its
Details.
There was a special session of the Grand
Parlor of the Native Daughters of the
Golden West yesterday for the purpose of
taking some action to avoid being pun
ished for contempt for not obeying the
alternate writ of mandamus issued bv
Judge Seawell. Five hours was spent In
trying to adjust the matter, and the only
question that was discussed was whether
the adjournment oh Sunday morning
would be deemed contempt, and the new
grand president would not assume the re
sponsibility of adjourning the Grand Par
lor to- June, 1903, but said the responsibil
ity would rest with the Grand Parlor. The
grand body did assume that responsibility
and adjourned until next June.
Yesterday, there was no response in
Judge Seawell's court when . the . man
damus proceedings were called, so the
matter was postponed until to-day, and It
is likely that the legality or illegality of
the institution of Genevieve Parlor will be
fully, gone into.

â¢â^v UR Eastern exchanges are noting with well-
I , 1 justified satisfaction the rapidity with which
Nâ S telephones are coming into use in the more
thickly settled rural districts of that section. An
illustration of the kind of news items that are now
becoming frequent is to be found in the report from
Pennsylvania that farmers living near Joanna "have
built a private telephone line between Conestoga and
Morgantown. In the evening after they have fin
ished their day's labor they attend to social.* inter
course and business among themselves over the line."
It is in New England that country telephones have
come into most extended use. The Southern New
England Telephone Company is reported to have
made special efforts to attract rural patrons, and by
giving low rates has succeeded in getting large
numbers' of farmers to put themselves in telephone
communication with, the neighboring villages' and
towns.
The advantages of the system are of course enor
mous. The farmer even more than the citizen needs
the telephone. Now that the movement toward sup
plying that kind of communication to rural districts
has been successfully launch' ed there are many sec
tions of California where it would be well to extend
it. In New England the system is said to cost the
farmer $18 a year, and for that sum he can communi
cate with any neighboring town . free .of further
charge. For more distant localities the price is
graded from five cents up to twenty-five cents. With
the telephone in his house the farmer is no longer,
isolated, nor is he required to make a journey every
time hÂ£, desires some business conversation. The
telephone, in fact, will be a great improvement in
the conditions of rural life and will go far to make,
people more content to-live on the farm.

SHOULD the people of California desire to
study an object lesson in the science of. forestry
before entering upon an extensive system of
forest preservation at home, they can find one in
Saxony. In that kingdom the care of forests has
been exercised for so long a time that an efficient
system has been worked out. Tried and tested by
time and found effective in practical operation, the
work is no longer experimental. It ha*s been raised
to the level of a science and is now carried on with
results so profitable as to render it worth the study
of any people who have a forestry problem to solve.
In the current number of Consular Reports, Ernest
L. Harris, United States consular agent at Eiben
stock, gives a brief review of the results of Saxon
forestry for the past year and the showing is a notable
one. The kingdom contains twelve forest districts
which are subdivided into one hundred minor dis
tricts. In the aggregate these forests are valued at
$79Â»538,399. The annual expense of maintenance is
about $1,005,364. The income derived from them
last year was $3,246,976, and the net profit was $2, :
241,611. There was, y of course, a variation in the
profits derived from the different forests. Thus 1 the
forest of the district of Moritzburg yielded a pro'fit
of but 1.2 per cent, while that of Eibenstock yielded
3.13 per cent The average yield was 2.71 per cent.
It is to be borne in mind that the indirect benefits
derived from the forests are much more valuable than
the direct profits derived frpm the sale of timber,
fuel, etc. The report says: "The forests of Saxony
serve not only the purpose of giving the state a sub
stantial annual revenue, but they add a thousandfold
to the scenery of the country, thus attracting many
tourists into these parts every summer. The most
important feature of the forests, however, is the fact
that they keep forever alive the fountains of water
which spring from the highlands of Erzgebirge and
Saxon Switzerland. The forests furnish the material
and the water the motive power to hundreds of pulp,
paper and saw mills which in turn give employment
to thousands of men, women and children.
Surely it is'worth while for Californians to profit
byt_that lesson California's forests are -wasted
and her mountain slopes left desolate. â¢Â¦

MR. F. B. THURBER of New York has been
the most active ally of the Cuban junta in its
effort to force free trade upon this country.
A firm of high-priced attorneys have been employed
to write briefs and arguments, and with these and
appeals to humanity the country has been flooded.
Pathetic pictures of starving Cubans have been used
to arouse sympathy, and the junta has not scrupled
to attack Americans who oppose free trade and to
characterize them as worse than the Spaniards from
whbm the island was freed by the blood and money
of Americans. As the readers of The Call have had
occasion to know, this free trade campaign has been
prosecuted with wonderful energy and as wonderful
disregard of all American interests. The War De
partment has been distinctly offensive in the matter.
The Secretary of War has assumed the position of
dictator of the economic policy of the Government,
and has led several generals of the army in an assault
upon Congress and upon the protective policy of the
Republican party. General Wood, the army surgeon
whom seniority of rank, perhaps, made Governor
General of Cuba, has been especially active in the
matter. He has left his post of duty several times to
instruct Congress, and has done this with an over
bearing air of authority that was distinctly offensive.
Enough facts have come to light to show that indus
trial conditions in Cuba were not as he represented
them. The difference between the facts and his
statements is so great as to raise the suspicion that he
took no pains to know the facts, or no pains to
state them if known. Against this forcible array of
juntas, allies, attorneys, the War Department and
generals in uniform stood the farmers of the beet
sugar States in determined defense of their sole in
terest in protection. The profit on beets was the first
fruit of protection that had found its way to their
pockets. They hired no attorneys, they sought no
alien allies, they had no generals in uniform on their
side, but they put up a fight so stubborn that the War
Department retired, whipped, from the first skir
mish. But the fight has been renewed in the Senate.
The generals are, again in evidence and the same
series of misrepresentations is in use.
But a bomb has fallen in the midst of the company
of promoters of free trade. When Mr. Thurber was
before the Senate committee preparing to go into
tears in behalf of the suffering Cubans he was con
fronted with evidence that he had been paid a large
amount of money by somebody to promote the free
trade movement This he admitted, and then was
immediately faced with evidence that the money had
been taken out of the public revenues of Cuba and
paid to him by General Wood in his capacity as Gov
ernor of the island. Seeing no way out Thjirber ad
mitted this also. Now here is a transaction that has
no parallel in the history of the Government Wood
held his office and his authority through the War
Department. This country was in temporary mili
tary occupation of Cuba. The military Governor
controlled the public revenues, and he took from
them tens of thousands of dollars to be used by
Thurber "in controlling legislation here in favor of a,
few large sugar planters and against American inter
ests. It is a most extraordinary proceeding. It
marks the height to which either the desperation pr
the effrontery of the War Department has risen in
its attempt to substitute all other departments and
assume their functions. It was a misuse of Cuban
funds, for which there can be no punishment, and
was, apparently, an attempt by the War Department
to either mislead public opinion or corrupt legisla
tion.
The country has had a surfeit of this business, and
those in authority who. are urging more of it would
better stop where they are.

WASHINGTON, June 16.â After a dis
cussion extending over parts of several
days the Senate to-day passed what is
popularly known , as -the London.' dock
charges. bill. The" opposition to the meas
ure.collapsed and. it was passed: without
division. >'Â¦Â¦â¢
Consideration then was continued of the
isthmian canal project, Cullom of Illinois
and Kittridge of South Dakota delivering
speeches in advocacy of the Panama
route. Y< The former based '- his .argument
principally on the report of the Isthmian
Caral Commission recommending that
route, asserting that he was satisfied that
a good . to Â¦ the property could be ob
tained.'. Kittridge f not onl strongly, fa
vored the Panama route, which, in his
judgment, was much the better, but also
attacked the j Nicaragua plan as lacking
in.definiteness. He pointed out that Costa
Rica was constitutionally unable to grant
the necessary | concession ! to the United
States, and said if the Nicaragua . route
were selected it would be a long time be
fore work could be begun, if it ever could
becin. ' i . ', ;Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦-.â¢Â¦
Just before adjournment a spirited dis
cussion was precipitated over a motion
by Proctor of Vermont to agree to a con
ference with the House on the army ap
propriation bill. Several weeks ago the
Senate was affronted by a message from
the House refusing, to submit to confer
ence certain Seriate amendments to the
bill. The opposition to Proctor's motion
was so vigorous that finally he was forced
to withdraw it for the present.
The House to-day transacted some mis
cellaneous business under suspension of
the rules.. It included the adoption of a
resolution appropriating $25,000 for . the
preparation of plans for a memorial \n
this city, to Abraham Lincoln, $100,000 to
ward the erection of a monument to the
prison ship martyrs who died off Brook
lyn as a result of the cruelties to which
they were subjected by the British during
the Revolutionary War and $10,000 for the
erection of a monument at Fredericks
burg, Va.,; to the memory .of General
Hugh Mercer, who was killed during the
the Revolutionary War, and $10,000 for the
ed to-day was to carry out an authoriza
tion made for this purpose in 1777 by the
Continental Congress. . ."Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦
Two bills were passed . to amend the
general pension laws â one to provide for
the restoration to the pension rolls of the
widows of soldiers who subsequently
married and were again widowed, and
one to increase the pension of those who
have lost a limb or were totally disabled
while In the military or naval service.
The latter bill also carries an important
provision to increase the pension of a sol
dier under the dependent act of 1890 from
$12 to $30 per month when such a pen
sioner requires frequent or periodical at
tendance. Â¦
! The resolution calling on the Secretary
of War for his reasons for the dismissal
of Rebecca J. Taylor, a clerk in the War
Department, was laid on the table, 109 to

What motive prompted this recourse to a distant out of the way place in bring
ing^ suit which involves his official \ v integrity and his personal honoris beyond.. the
comprehension of ordinary men. In this as in so many other. things the ways of Henry
T. Gage are peculiar.
Trial at Wilmington Township will of course be inconvenient and costly. Wit
nesses residing in San Francisco, Sacramento, Alameda and Marin County will have to
make the long journey, and when they arrive at Wilmington Township they will find no
hotel accommodation. Official documents and records on file in Sacramento or at San
Quentin will have to be taken there. The witnesses who live at Los Angeles near the
point of trial are few, and consist, wholly of persons who are beneficiaries of the frauds.
The inconvenience of the place evidently is counted' by Gage as an ; advantage to
himself. Doubtless he thinks that the farther he gets away from the scene of the
wrongs, the records of the State prison, and the residence of the merchants who are to
be witnesses against the prison administration, the better it will be for him. As for the
cost of the trial in that out of the way place, Gage thinks nothing. It is to be a criminal
case and accordingly the costs of the prosecution are to be paid not by Gage, the prose
cutor, but by the county of Los Angeles.
The Call knows of no reason why the State officials and the witnesses in the case
should be subjected to the inconvenience of attending a trial in a" distant place where
there are no accommodations. A fair and a full trial could have been had in this county,
in Sacramento, in Alameda, in Marin or in Santa Clara. Gage could have had his choice
of any Superior Judge he might prefer to try the issue. The Call would have interposed
no objection to any of them.
In declaring first that The Call had not charged him witlv any knowledge - of
wrongdoing, Gage showed signs of a desire to shirk the issue. Then when he held Â£
secret investigation of his own, instead of calling upon the Prison, Directors W make one
openly and fairly, he exhibited a fear that something might be clisclosed ttrct~w6uld hurt
him. Now by making a criminal prosecution in an obscure township he ''seems to be
seeking a means of prolonging the case and getting a trial postponed perhaps in
definitely. Â¦ >\. . -_ ; _. , : _..-,/ > ; . '
Whatever be the meaning of the*Wilmington Township move, it matters little. ,If
the courts decide that Wilmington Township is the place for the hearing, The Call will
be ready to meet the issue. The Call stands by its record. It will; prove the truth of
all of its charges and statements. It meets the prosecution with a demand for a speedy
trial and a full investigation'.
G. OVERNOR GAGE r has procured from a- Justice of the Peace of Wilmington
Township/ Los Angeles County, warrants for thearrest of the proprietor and
the manager of The Call upon a charge of publishing/a criminal libel against
himself. In answer to the charge The Call will assert the truth of every state
ment it has published concerning the frauds at San Quentin and will demand a' prompt
trial of the case. â¢ i .
Were the ; office of. Governor of California filled by any other person than Henry
T. Gage,\the proceedings taken in this case- would be surprising. When. f lhe charges of
The Call concerning the violations of law in the administration of San Quentin prison
were published, together with some important parts of the evidence that sustains them,
Governor Gage gave out an interview on the subject to the Los Angeles Recordi In
the course of that interview he is quoted as saying: "You will notice that nowhere in
these articles is it stated that I bad any knowledge of wrongdoing, or participated
knowingly in anything wrong/' That statement, published in the Record on May 26,
was republished in The Call May 27 for the purpose of giving the Governor's side' of
the story. He has now revoked that statement and alleges not only that The- Call 'has
charged him with knowingly participating in wrongdoing, but in his complaint of crim
inal libel distorts and misrepresents the statements of The Call for the purpose of making
them appear "willful and malicious." ..
Whether the Governor's mind was changed by its own meditation on the subject,
or whether the change was brought about by the prompting of others, matters little. It
suffices that after making an attempt at a secret investigation, conducted by himself, and
finding that The Call exposed the folly of that course, he has decided to appeal to
the courts. .

The attention of the Board of Public
Works was called to the nuisance caused
by clouds of dust arising from the grad
ing operations in the Potrero district and
being blown over. Kentucky street, from
Eighteenth to Twenty-third, to the an
noyance of residents and business men
occupying that thoroughfare. The Board
cf Works was requested to take immedi
ate steps to abate the nuisance.
The Board of Works was authorized, to
expend $2000 in completing the construc
tion of the Army-street sewer.
The ordinance requiring the use of
grooved girder rails on street roads was
rerel'erred to thÂ« Street Committee.
Supervisor Brandenstein held that the
owners of the property should help the
city out by trying to sell the land involved
in the judgment. He said that the land
was of no use to the city for park pur
poses, although he recognized the legality
of the tinal judgments obtained by che
owners. Brandenstein, however, was the
only Supervisor voting against the reso
lution.
The claims amounting to $25,000 upon
linal judgments filed by Henrietta Marke
witz, Joseph Goldstein and others arising
out of the suits commenced for the con
demnation of certain property for the
proposed St. Mary's Square were ordered
paid by the Board of Supervisors yester
day. An ordinance authorizing the'pay
ment of the judgments out of the fund
of $125,000 set aside for St. Mary's Square
was passed to print. Attorney Naphtaly
explained the legal aspect of the claims,
showing the Judgments are irrevoca
ble. Action was taken, notwithstanding
that the Auditor and Treasurer have been
enjoined from drawing on the fund pend
ing the final decision of its status by the
Supreme Court.
Attorney Charles Heggerty made a plea
that notwithstanding the opinion of the
City Attorney that resolutions of awards
of contracts for supplies need not be pub
lished in the official, paper, that they be
printed in conformity with the usual cus
tom of the board. The board decided to
advertise the ; awards this year, the
amount Involved being some $1700. The
City Attorney's opinion was referred to
the Committee on Judiciary and Print
ing to inquire into its legal effect, with
particular, reference to the charter re
quirements that the advertising must be
done.
Grattan Phillips urged the payment of
the claims of Phillips, Smyth & Van Or
dren for postal cards, stamps and print
ing, amounting to $1400, which had been
held up by the Finance Committee. Su
pervisor Brandenstein explained that
Phillips' firm had imposed upon the city
to the extent of $2000 in printing tran
scripts on appeal, and the City Attorney
has been asked for an opinion 'as to
whether any redress- could be had against
the firm or -Its bondsmen. Supervisor Wil
son said that the Finance Committee had
acted under the charter provision that no
claim shall be paid to any firm or person
who is indebted to the city. The claims,
however, were ordered paid by a vote' of
l;t ayes to 2 noes. *
The. San Francisco Retail' Merchants'

The Board of Supervisors adopted a res
olution yesterday granting the Atchison,
Topeka and, Santa Fe Railway Company
permission to construct a steel draw-,
bridge across Channel 'street at the foot
of Third street within three years' time.
The resolution is in conformity with 1 the
offer, of the company to build the bridge"
at its own expense, the estimated cost
being some $70,000. The company at one
time offered to stand one-half the ex
pense, the city to bear the other* half,
but in v4ew of the immense privileges
granted to the corporation by the city it
decided to relieve the board from any re
sponsibility in the premises. S
A resolution was finally passed provid
ing that incidental to the proposed change
of grade in the Nuevo Potrero district

way Company be required to construct a

In deciding the case, Judge Kerrigan
held that the contract is a direct viola
tion of the Sherman act, which provides
that contracts â¢ or agreements tending to
interrupt or : interfere with the progress
of. trade are invalid. .
In December,' 1901, the salt company
purchased from Getz Bros. 1516 ton3
of salt en route from Liverpool and con
signed to the grocers, also Duying the op
tion held by Getz Bros, in 2500 tons of
saline chemical. For the' cargo I and- the
option the trust offered two checks of
$5000 each, Getz Bros, agreeing that they
would not purchase salt from any firm on
this coast but the Federal Salt Company.
When the checks were presented for pay
ment they were dishonored and Getz
Bros, brought ; suit to enforce their pay
ment.
Judge Kerrigan decided yesterday that
Getz Bros., the grocers, were not entitled
to $10,000 for which they sued the Federal
Salt Company. The decision is an im
portant'one in that it affects contracts
of a peculiar nature made between trusts
and wholesale dealers.

These are" the statements that Mr.
Briggs has submitted to the State Board
of Trade. He was instructed by the
board to prepare a communication to be
forwarded to the. Southern Pacific Com
pany's traffic people. . The counties that
support the State Board of Trude are in
large grain-growing regions, and they
have a live interest in anything that con
cerns the cost of getting grain to market.
Arthur R. Briggs has a hard question
to ask the Southern Pacific Company in
behalf of the grain growers of the State.
According to a statement he has made to
the State Board of Trade the big: trans
portation company is discriminating
against the grain growers as compared
with its treatment of the fruit men of
California. Grain bags when empty and
on their way to the ranchers to be .filled
with grain for shipment, so he sets
forth, bring a rate for freight to the
transportation lines of $7 20 per ton. On
the same bags the rate, so finds Mr.
Briggs. is only $2 65 when they are filled
with grain. Why there is this difference
grain raisers of the State have been en
deavoring to find out without success.
There is no complaint that the rate on
the filled grain bags is too lowâ only that
the charge for moving empty sacks is
too high. In the case of empty cars go
ing to be filled with deciduous fruits from
the orchards of California there is no
charge for the haul to the orchards.
When the large charge of |7 20 per ton
is put on empty grain sacks the discrim
ination against the grain â¢ producers be
comes apparent.

XEW YORK. June lC.-j-The character of to
day's stock. market remained the same aj that
of last week. There were operations for a rise
in a few prominent stocks, but they -were -.not
aggressively pursued, and lefc no important net
results. St. Paul. Missouri Pacific, Union Pa
cific.- Canadian . Pacific and the Atchlgons were
most largely dealt in. It "will be seen that
none of these saved as much as a point of net
gains on the day, although Canadian Pacific
rose at one "time to 1% over Saturday and St.
Paul l?i- A number of the minor Granger
stocks were lifted at different times and the
Chicago and Northwestern stocks both made
3-point advances. Late in the day. . after the
indifference of the general market to this lead
ership was demonstrated, there was an ad
vance in .the Readings. This proved equally
inefficacious end the market closed dull and
easy, considerably below the .best. The move
ment in the Western stocks, while obviously
professional, seemed based on the assumption
of a. favorable outcome of the corn crop and
upon the argument of probable dividend in
creases. Nobody assumed that Â¦ the Missouri
Pacific dividend this week will. be changed from
the 2% semi-annual rate, and the heavy out
lays being. made by Union Pacific are against
the presumption of a. present increase. But the
example' of the Chicago and Northwestern in
crease is an influential one and affects espe
cially St Paul. The buying or this group of
stocks at the opening was sufficient to carry
up the price in face of rather heavy London
selling, induced by anxiety over the illness of
the King of England. The leaders of the cam
paign for the advance profess to feel assured
that the July first settlements will be effected
without any stringency of money. Last - year
the money market became active about this
time and at the close of the month call money
ran up to 25 per cent, and prices in the stock
market collapsed. During July of last year the
difference In the money market continued and
their effect on the stock market was aggravated
by the damage to the. corn ci-op and the steel
strike. Between June 22 and July 27 there
was a contraction of over $46,000,000 in the
lean account of the banks and it was not un
til the last of July that the banks began to
expand their loans again, after large receipts
of cash from the Interior and from eub-Treas
ury disbursements. The foreign trade state-.
ment for May. Just Issued, shows a decrease
In exports of upward of $22,000,000. showing
that the exports of manufactures fell some
what below thoee of May last year In addition
to the heavy decrease in agricultural products.
For eleven months in the fiscal year the trade
balance in favor of this country is, thus.re
duced nearly $168,000,000 below that for the
corresponding period of. last year. The indus
trial department .of the stock list was gener
allv heavy. United States Steel stocks were

the feeling is somewhat firmer on Persians and
higher prices are quoted on Fards. Sicily shell

eral situation shows few important features.
I-iarge sizes In Santa Clara prunes are steady,
â¢with C%c to 6%C quoted on 40-50s in 25-lb
boxes. A ferr lots axe being picked up through
the market at around thSe figures for new
fruit. Sizes 50s to SOs are also in some re-,
quest, and with the situation as to stocks fce
comlns strong-er. the feeling Is" generally firmer
on the more desirable, eiz.es and offerings. The
demand for local and interior jobbing account
seems to be restricted to small lots covering
purchasers' immediate wants. New crop Is at
tracting little attention at the moment, the
prices now out being regarded as somewhat
rpeculative In character. Santa Claras offer
from 2%c to 2;ic f. o. b. in bags, four-6lze ba
eis, with a price of 2%c named on Visalia fruit.
In currants there Is a dull, dragging ' market,
Â¦with quotations nominal at 5%c for" fine
Amalias uncleaned. â¢ '

SUMMARY OF THE . MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL
July that indicated that ,they thought it best
to suffer losses now rather than later. An at
tempt to cover a big line as the price advanced
scared all the little fellows .out. . July, which
opened as ; low as ' W3 : cents,, kept steadily â¢Â¦% ad
vancing. At C4'cents therenvaa liberal profit
taking, -but: thtf^close was strong, July 1 cent
up'at 64%c, the high point of the day.
â¢ Wheat was I relieved from ! dull Â¦ monotony by
the action in corn:: -Early liquidation " on the
clearing weather j weakened | the pit â¢ some,-*, but
Â¦trade was : slow, and the market haggled idly
for' some time. Cables were better, indicating
cold weather in France. ' Stocks were generally
bullish. When corn began showing its strength
wheat developed its short-lived activity. There
was almost- no : buying' business and this, pre
vented-an otherwise probable sharp rally. As
it was. there was ( little Â¦ inclination to sell
short, . and July, after opening %@Vic to %c
lower at 71%c. to 71%c, and dipping to 71%c,
rallied to a firm close, ;%@Vic up at 72c.
: Oats were dull and featureless. July closed
weak, %c lower at 39%@39%c.

though prices in pork fluctuated, widely. - July

Miss Nierhoff to Testify

AUBURN, June 16.â The real motive for
tho killing of Fred Nlerhoff by William
Glover is the one topic of interest in this
community, and the Coroner's inquest to
morrow morning promises to bring out
much that-ls now mere speculation. Ever
since Miss Nierhoff's confession, in which
she stated that the Glover boya bad de
liberately planned the . killing of her
father, the public- has anxiously awaited
further developments. While in the pres
ence of her affianced husband, William
Glover, the young lady insisted that the
killing was in self-defense, but later she
wavered, and as a result of the admis
'sions she made Oscar Glover, a. brother of
the murderer, was put "behind the bars.
Both of the Glovers refuse to discuss the
tragedy. - '

The detail for the court for the rest of
the week will be:
known Elk could be recognized, but in
most of the cases the disguise was
impenetrable.
A. P. Smilie of Alameda headed the
marching comics: He was dressed as his
Satanic Majesty in gorgeous red and
mounted upon a horse, black as the night,.
that danced to an 'accompaniment of fire
works. Then came a platoon of mock po
lice that did a drill that rivaled the figures
that Captain Petersen of the Oakland po
lice force puts his squad through on state
occasions.
The Elks' Carnival float, driven by Di
rector General Max Schlueter, was a very
handsome affair.
There was every possible character in
the line, from tramps and negroes to Little
Eva, Topsy, acrobats, and the man who
had to walk home from bathing, in a bar
rel.
Every kind of vehicle that could be
made to move was utilized, from a six
mule dray to rapid moving automobiles,
two-wheeled donkey carts, jinrickshaws,
wheelbarrows and a patrol wagon.
The imitation bridal party, with Deputy
County Clerk Ray Baker as footman and
six pages carrying the bride's veil over
the back of the hack vied with the laun
dry float in raising a laugh along the
route. The lion tamer sitting in a cage
with one very scared cat concluded the
spectacle.
It was in the grounds that the Imitation
police had the most to do. There the
"Elkville Court and County Jail" were in
full session. The police patrolled the
grounds, and woe betide any Elk who was
found even drawing his breath. He was
Immediately taken before George W. Reed
as "Jedge and fined all he had in his
pockets.
The detail of police for this occasion
consisted of the following:
OAKLAND, ~une 16.â Kins: Car
nival reigned to-night in Oakland
and the Elks took charge of
everything from, early afternoon
to early morning. It was Carni
val night, and the members of
Oakland Lodge racked their brains for
Ideas with which to entertain the people
of Oakland and visitors.* The result of
f- these Ideas was the street parade and
subsequent events in the fair grounds.
Nothing like to-night's parade has been
attempted before on this side of the bay.
llarcbing demonstrations heretofore have
been of the serious order, but to-night
there was not a serious feature in the en
tire parade, from the imitation platoon of
police at the beginning to the end. There ;
was no particular form to the procession,
but, literally, it was a "howling suc
cess."
As in the case of the other parades the
Streets of Oakland were black with peo
ple, and at the time that the parade was
making its way through the town there
were as many people within the fair
grounds as without.
The parade seemed to have walked out
fef the pages of the comic papers, for
every character that is known to the char
ccturist's pencil had its imitation in real
life in the marching crowd. With these
merry copies were as many equally merry
originals. Underneath the costumes, wigs,
paint and powder occasionally some well
NEVADA, June 16.â Austin Otis Holbrook,
the ten-year-old son of Frank Holbrook, was
drowned In the Red Hill reservoir, one mile
from this city, yesterday afternoon.
Another booth that is continually
crowded with purchasers Is the little log
cabin, where the Fabiola ladies sell the
most delicious French doughnuts. The in
terior of the cabin is lined with white
and large wreaths of ivy relieve the mo
notony of the walls. Mrs. Charles Leon
ard Smith was in charge to-day and was
assisted by Mrs. M. E. Dow, Mrs. O. C.
KJrk, Mrs. Legault, Mrs. Willard Bar
ton and Mrs. John Yule. Mrs. R. W. Gor
rill and Mrs. Oscar Gowing will be in
charge to-morrow.
The Squirrel Inn is another very popu
lar resort. This booth is being conducted
under the patronage of the New Century
Club and has bejen fitted up in the dainti
est manner possible. The colors of the
club are delft blue and white and are used
in the decorations with delightful effect.
To-day six little girls from the West Oak
land Cooking School made the hot biscuits
and salad and the famous Squirrel Inn
coffee in fullview of the patrons. They
wore quaint little white caps and aprons.
The little waitresses to-day were Elsie
Pump, Ethel Rupert, Belle Cuddy, Es
peran'za Ortez and Sadie Yates. Mrs. Ed
win Taggart presided as hostess and was
assisted by Mrs. -D. T. Fowler, Mrs. C. O.
Huber. Mrs. Cora | Merritt, Mrs. Long.
Miss J. P. Wheaton, Mrs. F. A. Ring and
Miss Lucille Huber.
The ghostly saleswomen in the Emery
ville Free Kindergarten booth have been
very successful in selling mysterious
packages to carnival visitors. The booth
was in charge of Mrs. H. H. Miller, Mrs.
J. A. Johnson and Miss E. A. Johnson to
day.
The Native Daughters' floral booth is
very attractive, the golden poppy forming
the basis of the decoration. Mrs. Max
Schlueter is in charge and Is assisted by
Mrs. H. M. Sanborn, Mrs. J. E. Baker,
Mrs. Lincoln Frick, Mrs..T. C. Landregan.
Mrs. "J. F. Bruning, Mrs. Lulu Bruning,
Miss del Sisternia, Miss Mary Moore, the
Misses Winnie and Dora Andrews, Mrs.
V. A. Derrick nnd Miss Annie Meyer,
The colonial kitchen continues to be one
of the popular attractions at the fair,
and the gray-robed waitresses are becom
ing as adept in their new profession as
any French restaurant garcon. Few are
able to resist the allurements of the
pretty, homelike booth; with its great
open fireplace and 'tasteful decorations.
Mrs. Charles J. Heeseman was hostess
to-day, her assistants being Mrs. W. W.
Crane, Mrs. J. Cal Ewing, Mrs. D. D.
Crowley, Mrs. A. P. Leach, Mrs C. F.
Hall, Mrs. Umphrey, Mrs. Samuel Platt,
Miss Lou Curdts and Miss Lou Denison.

"Gradually, to my surprise, toward the
close of the second week the sort of men-

long time broke away and I grasped the
thought presented with a clearness I had
not known for a long time.
"I came back to my school with better
health and memory than I have known
for 20 years, and now, while at work, I
repeat I have better nerve and brain

"Email appetite and poor digestion kept
tie weak. I had been compelled to rest
at the noon hour and shut myself away
from all company morning and night In
this way only could I work up to about

from California led me to share a dish
of Grzpe-Nuts with her. During the win-
ter I ate occasionally of the food, always

"Last July it was necessary for me to

ANOTHER MINNEAPOLIS
DETECTIVE IN TROITBLE
He Is Accused of Committing Perjury
at the Trial of A Brother
Officer.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., June 16.â The
trial of Christopher Ncrbeck of the de
tective force, for bribery, was Interrupted
to-day by a .sensational occurrence;
George E. Harvey, another detective, had
testified with reference to the swindling
of one, Peter Burg, out of a check by
confidence men. Asked if he received any
money from Burg, he said he had not.
The State then put Burg on the stand, and
Burg swore that he had paid Harvey $70
for recovering his check. This testimony
was corroborated by another witness.
Judge Harris immediately ordered Harvey
committed for perjury and recommended
that the bribery affair be investigated by
the Grand Jury.

friendly to cremation because the expense Is
very much less than that, of -Interment. They
know that if cremation sets the pace in fu-
neral ' reform reduced prices must â¢ be met, or
graveyards closed. They control .Â¦ over . five
hundred hacks, the drivers of, which belong
to the Hackmen's Union, Local No. 224. That
union, (through i misrepresentation made to
them) has resolved not to drive for us at our
funerals or rent hacks. to attend them. v '
We think the friends of cremation will, if
necessary, dispense with a string of hack*
and the services of the united Undertakers
rather than see incineration obstructed by a
causeless, heartless boycott of the dead.'

â¢ Some months ago in an Interview Flor

The settings are of the handsomest ever
seen In the city, and great credit is due
thereupon. to the management. The first

tures are the garden and ballroom scenes.

whom the local playgoer is so gratefully
familiar. You can lead a Horse to the
water but 'you can't make him drink.
Something: or some one haa coaxed Ed
ward Morgan to the classic drama's brink,
"but has left him unpersuaded of' its at
tractions. But for the aforesaid momen
tary flashes there is not an ounceof con
viction in the whole conception.
. A worse actor would easily have made a
better Romeo, with all . the' bend and
weight of Morgan's personality and tem
perament pulling in the opposite direc
tion. Anything more curiously out of kfey
would be . difficult to Imagine, anything
more perfunctory, impossible. Sparka
flew for a moment during the killing- of
Tybalt, but before , that, at Mercutlo's
taklng-off, the Romeo restraint reached an
Indifference, that - was truly wonder
ful. Once, in the. ballroom scene also,
Mr. Morgan appeared to rouse to a sense
.of - .the. â¢ romance -.of the situation,
and one. rose to the bait, only to drop
into disappointment afterward.
Froni the unwillingness of, the actor's
elegant leanness to Â«flt itself into cloak
and tjghts, to the refusal of his tense,
taciturn modernity to lend itself to the
leisurely and graceful extravagance of
the part, Mr. Morgan's Romeo may be
said to be almost a pattern misfit. -His
diction is as distinctly unclassic as his
voice is beautiful â and that is saying not
littleâ and. altogether, it is up to the actor
to answer the famous query (slightly
edited): "Morgan, wherefore art thou
Romeo?"
Miss Fealy's Juliet was perhaps a con
siderable excuse for the Morgan Romeo.
By no stretch of Imagination was it pos
sible to conceive of last night's Juliet be
ing even in stage lo<*e with the unlucky
Montagu. The conception lacked from
every side, in sympathy, In spontaneity,
in i truthfulness. It was unillumined by
even a glimpse of the Juliet spirit and
technically stagy and insincere. .
The best work of the evening was done
by Herschel Mayall as Mercutio, and Gil
bert Gardner, who gave a thoroughly
happy sketch of Peter. Margaret Terry
undertook with fair success the nurse's
role, and the rest of the cast filled in
without distinction.

QUESTION OF VERACITY.
Dr. Frank E. Platt, former lecturer at
the college In question, testified that he
lectured there for one year, and that at
the end of the year students who had
never attended his lectures came up for

The members of the faculty of the San
Francisco Dental College contend that the
State â¢ board, nearly all the me/nbers of
which are graduates of the University of
California, is acting with prejudice; that
their college 'wa3 recommended to the
national association by last year's board,
but owing to the. refusal of the deans of
the other dental colleges to report upon
the college to the association the indorse-,
ment by the national association was de
layed. "'" : ' * â¢
The members of the faculty of the San
Francisco College were subpenaed to ap
pear before the board yesterday and show
why their graduates should be allowed. to
take the examination. The board gave its
reason for holding the investigation that
it was not satisfied with the college
books showing the records of attendance
and standing. In behalf of the college
Drs. A. E. Blake, A. E. Sykes, H. A.
Tennyson and_C. Deichmiller and H. M.
Owens, professor of jurisprudence and at
torney for the. college, testified that the
college was run in a reputable manner. It
was found that out of the forty-six grad
uates only ten had a record of 80 per cent
and fifteen a record of 75 per cent attend
ance, when every graduate should- have
attained 75 per cent. H. M. Owens ad
mitted that the books and records were
not kept as they should be, but said that
was the way with all new colleges.
The board adopted a resolution ex
punging from the minutes the resolution
of the former State Board indorsing the
San Francisco Dental College. \
As this will be the first case to come
to court under the new law, which went
into effect September 1, 1901, it will be
watched; with keen interest by all the
dentists of the State. :
FACULTY IS SUBPENAED.
H. M. Owens, attorney for the college,
stated that the action of the board would
be reviewed and that one of the graduates
would immediately bring suit to test the
law's constitutionality. :
No person shall be eligible for examination
by the' State Board of Dental Examiners who
shall not furnish satisfactory evidence of hav
ing graduated from a reputable dental college
of the United .States of America, which must
have been indorsed by the Board of Dental Ex
aminers of California, and be a member of the
National Association of Dental College Facul
ties, y.
1 The > board will refuse to examine , the
applicants of this college this morning on
the ground that they do not come under
the provisions of the first class of section
12 oÂ£ the State law which reads:
Resolved.- That we do not Indorse the same.

Escaping Soldiers From

Capture.
Steal Gun Prom Guard and
Disappear Among Sau
salito Hills.
For a time yesterday afternoon and last
night Sausalito experienced all the excite
ment of being placed under martial law.
Soldiers of the United States army sta
tioned at Fort Baker paraded through
the little town with loaded guns and belts
ladened with ammunition, presenting -a
very belligerent appearance. A â¢- guard
was stationed at the entrance to the ferry
clip and every man who boarded the boat
was closely scrutinized. The cause of all
These warlike arrangements was the es
cape' of two prisoners from the Fort Ba
ker reservation, where they had been
serif under a guard to work on the road.
In effecting their escape the two prison
ers, whose* names are Edward Cault and
John E. Clauch, overpowered the sentry
Â¦who was detailed to guard them. With
twenty-two other prisoners from Alcatraz,
>Jault and Clauch were. at work grading
the road between the reservation and Sau
talito. They were being guarded by a
Equad of men under Lieutenant Bern
liard of the Coast Artillery. Shortly after
1 o'clock, Clauch and Cault were taken by
Sentry S. A: A\etherly down to a spring
near the boundary of the reservation : to
obtain some water. When the two-pris
oners got out of sight of Lieutenant Bern
hard and his squad, they turned on Weth
crly, overpowered him, took his gun and
Jive cartridges and started on a run
toward Sausalito. .
Wetherly said that when the prisoners
got out of the guards' sight one of them
remarked that "now is a good time to
make a run," whereupon both turned and
made as if to attack him. He claims that
he leveled his gun at one of the men- and
pulled the trigger, but that the rifle
missed fire. In the struggle that the two
prisoners had with the sentry to obtain
possession of the gun one of them kicked
iim on the knee, badly laming him.
Wetherly limped back to the fort and
cave the alarm. In an instant all was
excitement. Captain Ludlow, who is in
command, ordered put both â¢ the Sixty
lirst and the Sixthy-eighth United States

Miss Bess F. Healy, 521 Wabash street.
St. Paul, Minn., a promlnent,society girl,
writes: .
"I took Peruna fast summer, when
I was all run down, and had a head-
ache and backache and no ambition
tor anything. I now feel as well as
I ever did in all my life, and all
thanks is due to your excellent Pe-
runa."
The symptoms of summer catarrh arÂ»
quite unJifce. In different cases, but the
mest common ones are general lassitude,
played-out, tired-out, used-up, run-down
feelings, combined with more or less
heavy, stupid, listless, mental condition. -
Relisb # for food and the ability to digest
food seenis to be lost.
Skin eruptions, sallow complexion, bil-
iousness, coated tongue, fitful, irregular
pieep, help to complete the picture which
is so common at this season. "*^~-
Life is a burden, business a dread,'
pleasure a mockery, friends a bore and
social privileges a tedious round of disa-
greeable tasks.
Peruna so exactly meets all these condi-
tions that the demand is so great for this
remedy at this season of the year that it
is nearly impossible to supply it.
It never fails to bring an immediate re-
lief, and a thorough course of it leads
with certainty to a permanent cure.
Miss Anna Johnson. 60 Clergy street,
Kingston, Ont., writes:
"I have suffered for several years with
scrofulous blood, and it would many times \
break out in unsightly pimples on my '
face. I also had severe Indigestion. I took
Peruna and soon found that it cured tha
indigestion and gave me a fine appetite.
I was also pleased that it drove the humor
out of my blood. My skin is now smooth
and clear and my health is excellent."â
Miss Anna Johnson.
May V. Adams, vice president of thÂ«
Louisiana Literary Union, writes from
1119 Terpsichore street. New Orleans, La.,
as follows: "Any person with sedentary
habits is apt to become habitually consti-
pated. I have found this to be the case
by sad experience, and am thankful to
say that Peruna cleansed my system, pu-
rified the blood and drove out stomach
disorders and all aches out of the body.
I take a few doses every few weeks and
find that it keeps mo in perfect health. I
believe it to be an ideal woman's medi-
cine."
If you do not receive prompt and satis-
factory results from "the use of Peruna
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable aÂ«-\_
