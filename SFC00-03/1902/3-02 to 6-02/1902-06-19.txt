CALL BUREAU, 1406 G
STREET, N." W.,'WASHING
TON, June IS.â Considerable
comment was ocefsioned in
naval circles here to-day by
the caustic lone of Rear Ad
miral Crowninshield' n disapproval of the
recommendation for a court-martial- made
by the court appointed by Captain Crai?
to Inquire into the arrest of the four offi
cers of the Chicago at Venice. It is pre
dicted that changes will soon be made in
the assignments of Captain Dayton, .or
Captain Wynne. Lieutenant Doddridge
and Surgeon Ledbetter, who were arrest
ed. It is predicted by naval officers here
that friction will arise between those offi
cers accused and Captain Dayton, who
was president of the court. It is consid
ered somewhat unusual thst Captain Day
ton should be made the head of a court tu
conduct an Inquiry regarding his own otfl
j cere. Captain Dayton, it appear?, had,
I before the court was ordered, expressed
an opinion on the case in his telegram ex
plaining the situation. In that message
he said that one of the officers was drunk:
The^ Chicago left Gibraltar yesterday for
they declined to do. Rear Admiral A. S.
Crowninshield, commanding the European
squadron, in reviewing, the findings of the
court, severely censures Captain James II.
Dayton, commander, of the Chicago, for
not personally attending to the defense of
the officers and comments on the "revolt
ing Indignities" suffered by the officers
while confined at Venice. Under the cir
cumstances Admiral Crowninshield holds
"a court-martial would be a farce."
Captain Dayton's court of Inquiry mi
nutely traces the movements of the offi
cers of the Chicago oÂ» the day of their
arrest, and says Lieutenant John S. Dod
dridge and Surgeon Robert E. Ledbetter
were' "affected by liquor to a noticeable
extent, but were not intoxicated in the
ordinary moaning of the term, and there
Is no evidence that the other parties were
affected by drinking." . .
The disturbance arose when Captain
Wynne, commanding the marine guard of
the Chicago, seeing Doddridge and Led
better sitting outside of the Florlan
Cafe, gave a hall, unusual In this place
resembling "yl, yi.'yi." "* '

NEW LIGHT ON AFFAIR.
LONDON; 'June IS.â TheVext of the find-
Ings of the court of\ inquiry in the case of
the United States naval officers impris
oned at Venice in the latter part of April
throws a new and important light on the
affair. It now appears that the* United-
States Consul at Venice, iHenry A. John
son, and the lawyer provided, by -him for
the defense, urged the officers to plead
that they were violently drunk. This Â¦

50,000 comply with' the " legislation of the

The basis for the apportionment of dele-^

making 799 votes from these five districts,:
which united to call : the convention.
As stated at- headquarters, -^conditions
are not satisfactory to the Inlners in
Missouri,.- Kansas, Arkansas and Indian
Territory and it Is believed the delegates
from these sections will vote for a' strike.
PROSPECT OF . GENERAL STRIKE

fNDIANAPOLIS. June 18.â An of
ficial call, for a national convention
of the. United Mine Workers, of
America was Issued this afternoon
from' the national headquarters In

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED MINE Â¦ WORKERS OF AMERICA, "WHO
HAS CALLED! A SPECIAL NATIONAL CONVENTION TO BEHELD
AT INDIANAPOLIS TO CONSIDER THE COAL STRIKE. '
gan. where the union has been having
trouble, the delegates will also be In
structed for a national suspension. Cen
tral Pennsylvania will contribute a cer
tain number, of delegates who will want
a general. strike, as will also Kentucky.
It , remains for Western Pennsylvania,
Ohio. Illinois and Indiana to offset this,
as it is officially understood the miners
in these districts are not very enthu
siastic, "for ; a general stoppage of coal
production.
MITCHELL HAS A PLAN.
There; is a strong belief here that
President Mitchell has some plan to sub
mit-to the delegates, and this belief is
strengthened by- the fact that he delayed
the call so long. He had a conference
.with 'President Patrick Gllday of the
Central Pennsylvania bituminous district
oh Sunday, and has been in frequent
communication with soft coal leaders in
the W^st.
.The great, barrier to be overcome in the
campaign for a national suspension is the
yearly .wage scale agreement that many
oÂ£ ,the soft coal miners have with the
companies. These agreements arc looked
upon as contracts, and .a large percent
age of * miners ' in .the West ara rather
averse to" breaking them. The principal
bone of contention. in the anthracite re
gion .is for. a ( yearly wage agreement.
Those who - are opposed to a general
strike use the argument . that i f the soft
coal miners break these contracts and ~o
on strike, to. help â¢ the anthracite men
they -would be losing in the West what
the hard coal 'miners, are fighting for In
the East.. Some of the national leaders
who .have , discussed - the . subject at strike
headquarters; say that if the life of the
organization was in, danger the conven
tion-would not hesitate to callfor a na
tional strike.'- " .

The mob then swept on down Belmont

Galleano at their head, were in the lead.
A half mllo march brought the mob to
the Cedar Cliff mill, where they stayed
until all- the operatives were out.
GALLEANO AT HEAD.
President Grossgebauer telephoned for
the police. Stones rained into the office
and flew about his head. Twenty younc

Then McQueen leaped into control of the
meeting. He calledTior a vote on the
question of calling for a general strike of
all branches of the silk trade. All voted In
favor, and a committee was appointed to
consider means for bringing the silk work

The court refers to the disadvantage at
which the officers were placed at the trial,
owing '.to 1 their-' Ignorance "of the Italian
language and laws, and says:
AT A DISADVANTAGE.
The officers pleaded self-defense against
civilians; that ,no police wero' knowingly
resisted and that their intention was not
to release Lieutenant Doddridge. but to
protect . him from violence inflicted by
outsiders.

Captain Wynne. Surgeon Ledbetter, Na

TUCSON. Ariz.. June IS.â A roving band
of twenty Yaquis engaged fifteen soldiers
of the Mexican reserves last night at Vj
o'clock and a desperate fight resulted, in
which three Indians were killed and five
were wounded. The battle occurred only
a mile and a half from Herrnosillo, and
on account of its proximity the news
alarmed the people of that city. The re
serves were patrolling the neighborhood
of Hermosillo when they were attacked
by the Yaquis, who on account of their
superior numbers hoped to defeat the
Mexicans. The latter, however, fought
desperately and succeeded in routing the
Indians, who fled, leaving their dead and
wounded. Only two of the Mexicans were
seriously -wounded and not one of their
number was killed.
The backbone of the Yaqul rising has
been broken, and General Torres Is aim

WASHINGTON, June lS.-The War De
partment has transmitted to- the Interior
Department information that trouble is
threatened among the Apache Indians on
the San Carlos reservation in Arizona on
account of the proposed shutting off of
beef and other rations after July 1 next.
The action of the War Department is
based on reports received from General
Funston, commanding the Department of
the Colorado, who predicts that in case
, the rations are discontinued the Indians '
will take beef and other supplies wher
ever they can get them in that section,
regardless of consequences. Governor
Murphy of Arizona Is In the city and has
, received advices along the same lines.
' The Secretary of the Interior to-day tel
egraphed Agent Carson of the San Carlos
Agency to make a full report on tne mat
ter and directed that the issue of rations
to the Indians be not stopped on the 3uth
inst., as planned, but be continued until
further directions are given by. the In- ,
terior Department. . . â¢
Secretary Hitchco.ck said to-day that it
was not proposed to discontinue rations to
all of the Indians, But that those capable
of working should be given work as far
as possible and issues to them, discon- j
tinued. It was estimated that employ
ment could be given to between 300 and
350 of the Indians. The remainder would
continue to draw rations. " - I
General Funston's report is based on a
, report from Colonel Lebo of the Four
teenth Cavalry, commanding at Fort
Grant, Arizona. General Funston says
the Apaches are not self-supporting and
will not be for many years, If ever, and
that the discontinuance of Issues to them
will be followed by serious trouble.
The Indians on the San Carlos reserva
tion, which Is in Eastern Arizona, are the
Tontos, San Carlos and Coyotero Apaches,
about 2200 In all.

Gernault attracted attention at the
London Tuberculosis Congress last year
by challenging Professor Koch's an
nouncement that it was impossible for
human beings to become inoculated from
virus of cattle. He went to Berlin and
offered to make practical test of his the
ory, but the offer was not accepted. Since
then the doctor has been making a series
of practical, tests. He says hÂ© . is con
vinced Koch is mistaken and accuses him
or deceiving the public.
In order to prove his contention, Ger
rmult went to the slaughter house of La'
Villette and inoculated himself with
consumptive matter from a cow which
had been ordered destroyed.' The opera
tion was performed in the presence of
three doctors. On the previous night Ger
nault blistered his forearm below the el
bow and, after exposing the wound, from
which blood was flowing freely, applied to
to it the poultice composed of the pounded
glands of the cow. He left this in con
tact with his flesh for two hours and his
arm was not washed or dressed after
ward. What remains of the glands will
be injected into guinea pigs. Â¦ \
The doctor does not expect results for
two or three weeks. The disease may
then manifest itself In the form of a
local affection and thence spread to the
lungs. Out of :ten known cases of slaugh
ter house men who were accidentally con
taminated, three have died and the health
of the others was shattered. If disease
declares itself, Gernault will be treated
by Dr. Theodore Smith of Boston, Mass.,
who has been exposed to the dangers of
contagion from bovine tuberculosis. Ger

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
This afternoon the anarchists, who
seemed to be in command, were openly
threatening that a policeman's life would
pay for each wounded rioter.
Harry Harris, a reporter on the Morn
â¢ing Call," was injured at this point. He
was armed with a '. revolver and had a
camera with which he attempted to take
pictures, standing on a stoop a short dis
tance away. He was in the act of train
ing the camera and was warned to desist.
A moment later a rain of stones fell about
him and he was knocked down. As He fell
men ru3hed on him and he -was kicked and
beaten. He drew his revolver and tried
to use it, but it was kicked from his hand.
A man grabbed it and fired at Harris, the
bullet entering his chest. He has a slight
chance of recovery. By this time the mill
was emptied of the operatives, and this
ended the rioting for the day.
During the day from time to time
wounded men had been carried to the
hospitals. Besides those whose names
can be given it is certain that many more
were hurt.
. The shooting seemed to scatter the riot
ers, but It was not long before an immense
mob had formed again, this time about
the Gaede mill, on North Straight street,
where there was a crowd of 2000. Half of
them were rioters and the rest onlookers.
The mill was bombarded and before the
mob stopped there ! was not a whole win
dow in the building. ,
It was about this time that Mayor
Hinchcliffe called "on the firemen for aid.
Men were detailed from each company and
armed, and during the afternoon rendered
efficient service.
MAYOR CALLS FIREMEN.
The mob drew back and the policeman
regained his post in the doorway. Severai
shots were nred at him, but none took
effect. He replied, firing directly into the
crowd, until his weapon was emptied,
when live more uniformed men and one in
plain clothes came on a run through Ful
ton street. The mob kept on firing, and
the policemen charged, firing, when the
strikers broke and ran. j Spectators say
that fully 100 shots were fired. Salvino
was left behind and was taken to the hos
pital. One hundred and fifty" hats "were
picked up in the street afterward, which
were lost" in the wild scramble to get
away. . ..
â¢ The Hall mill, which shelters four silk
working firms, was the next point of at
tack. A single policeman guarded the
main entrance. He was ordered to stand
aside, and on refusing he was attacked.
He drew his revolver and began to fire.
Lora Salvino, an Italian, 24 years of age,
Â¦who lives and works in Hackensack, re
ceived the first bullet, which penetrated
both lungs.
Flushed with success, the mob pushed
across the Main-street bridge to the New
Jersey Silk Company's establishment,
where the employes were driven out. At
Levy's mill, River and Bridge streets, the
manager met the mob at the door and
assured the leaders that the employes
were preparing to leave.
When the mill was emptied the strikers
moved on, passing through River street
to the Laurel and Empire mills, where
only two patrolmen were on duty, and
were powerless against the mob. The
managers of the three mills had deter
mined to empty their mills and two of
tnem had done so, but the Augusta mill
was full, although shut down. The mob
found- this out and burst in. They found
themselves face to face with the women
of the mill, led by Mrs. Parker, deter
mined to stand their giound. The women
were thrust aside and driven out of tho
n<Ul.
loaced with policemen charged through
the mob on Cliff street: Stones rained
tiuwn on the wagon and none of the po
hcemen escaped. Patrolman Irving Post
saw a man hurl a rock and fired, the bul
let striking 1 the rioter in the neck. Before
the officer could get to the man he was
huuled into the mob and hurried away.
With revolvers drawn the officers quick
ly deployed and the mob fell back.
A block away Galleano again appeared
and led the mob through Temple street
to Pelgram & Myers' mill, where the em
ployes were compelled to coroe out.
POLICE ARE POWERLESS.
Other witnesses were called, but they
could not throw any light* on the tragedy
that has shocked the entire community.
In reply to queries from the Coroner
and District Attorney she said that she
became engaged to Will Glover on the
13th of January, but a short time ago
she told him that she was becoming tired
of the way he was acting and that she
did not want anything more to do with
him.
Asked why she told a different story
the night after the murder, she said that
Oscar Glover was still at large and she
was afraid he would kill her. -. It was
brought out that she had received a reg
istered letter from Will Glover the next
day after the killing, but Miss Nierhoff
said that it had no bearing on the case. v
Continuing her story, she said that Os
car went away after the shooting and re
turned with a livery rig. He called Will
Glover out of the house, where he had
remained since the tragedy, and, picking
up a club near the white oak tree where
the shooting occurred, said they would
make out that this was the club used
by Nierhoff. Will took al! of his pictures
from the house, with the intention, it is
supposed, of keeping them from the news
papers. Frank Whitall, a neighbor,
called after the Glovera left and he and
the witness drove into town to notify her
mother of the tragedy.
FEARS OSCAR GLOVER.
Mr. Nlerhoff interrupted the witness to
ask her to repeat what Will Glover said
at the time. The young lady replied:
"He said: 'I wteh your mother was here
and I -would kill the whole family.' "
Miss Nierhoff said that she did not go
out of doors during the affray, but wit
nessed it from behind the glass door of
the parlor. Will Glover came into the
parlor after the shooting, and said:
"Well, I have killed your father."
At this she fainted. Shortly after re
gaining consciousness she looked out of
the door and saw the Glovers driving
away.
"I grabbed the gun." she said, "and
would have shot WiU Glover if I had the
strength. I did go to the door, and, point
ing the gun at them, ordered them to
bring father Into the house. They did so
and father sent me for a jug of water.
They laid him on blankets on the floor
and Will Glover placed a pillow under
hia head. The brothers then went to one
side and had a consultation. Oscar came
to me and said: 'When this comes into
court you can 'testify that it was an ac- v
cident or I will kill you.' I- declared that
I would not do it." Â«
FAINTS AFTER THAGEBY.
the gun. I cried out, 'Don't kill me!' I
did not say anything after breakfast.
Father went out into the field, where he
was engaged in hauling hay to the barn.
A. T. Dozier, a neighbor, visited the
house shortly after the breakfast hour,
and he and Miss Nlerhoff conversed for
about five minutes. Glover went into her
father's room and stood by the open win
dow with his gun, thus preventing, her
from warning Dozier. Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦
"I called father to dinner at the. noon
hour," she continued, "and Glover kept
guard on my movements as before.
About 4 o'clock father came to the barn
with a load of hay, and had been there
but a short time when Oscar Glover
caone up and began a discussion, presum
ably about a horse-collar, Father went
into the barn and came out with the col
lar in his hand. About this time Will
Glover, who had not showed himself thus
far, set down the shotgun and rushed
into Nierhoff's room and got father's rifle
and came outside. As soon as Oscar saw
him he called out, 'Will, don't shoot.'
Father advanced toward Will, dropping
the horse-collar as he advanced, and also
saying, 'Don't shoot, Will.' At the same
time he endeavored to grasp the gun.
Will freed himself from father and fired.
Oscar meanwhile standing by, a silent
witness."

PATERSQN MILLS ARE WRECKED,
Bartlett (Dem.) of Georgia offered an
amendment to the deficiency bill to re
imburse the Cuban revenues for the sal
ary allowed by Secretary Root to Â¦ Gov
ernor General Wood out of the island's
revenues. In the course of some remarks
early in the session, Cannon declared that
if he could have his way Congress would
adjourn sine die before July 4.
Loud of California, under the latitude
allowed in general debate, submitted some
remarks upon the question of salaries- for
postal employes. He said he believed that
the Government should pay liberal sal
ariesâas high as private corporations, but
no higher. Employment in the Govern
ment service, he maintained, had ad
vantages over private employment. A
Government employe had liberal leaves of
absence. His employment was continuous
whether times were good or bad. While
there was, he said, a steady agitation. for
the increase of the pay of postal clerks,
railway mail clerks and letter-carriers,
the particular agitation was for the- in
crease of the pay of the latter class from
an average of J91S to $1200 a year. He
declared that, all the circumstances con
sidered, the pay of the letter-carriers was
the highest for the service performed of
that in any branch of the Government
service. He undertook to show, compara
tively speaking, that if the letter-carriers
should receive $1200, the railway mail
cleriis, whose salaries averaged $1020,
should get J1600.
The general deficiency appropriation bill,
the last of the supply bills, was passed.
A night session was held, at which the
House considered bills reported from the
Committee on Indian Affairs.
Shallenberger (Dem.) of ..ebraska also
made a political speech, condemning the
administration for removing Miss Taylor^
a clerk in the War Department, who
criticized its Philippine policy, and for jus
tifying General Wood's expenditures for
the promotion of reciprocity legislation.
Cannon, charman of the Appropriations
Committee, In a brief reply to both
speeches, said he was ready to go to the
country on the record of the Republican
party. He caused much merriment on his
side of the House by describing the Re
publican party as puhing the wagon, while
the Democrats stood off and found fault.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â The near ap
proach of the end of the present session
of Congress was signalized by a general
political speech by Richardson of Tennes
see, the leader of the minority. Taking
advantage of the latitude allowed during
general debate on the deficiency appro
priation bill, he delivered a set speech of
an hour and a half. He arraigned the
Republican party for its failure to keep its
platform promises, dwelling especially on
the question of trusts and the necessity
for tariff reduction.
In advocating the adoption of the Ni
caragua route Pettus declared that the
American people wanted and would have
an Isthmian canal, to be built, owned
and controlled by the United States. He
said there were many men in the United
States "who control vast sums of money,
of which neither Croesus nor Solomon
ever dreamed , who are opposed to any
canal, because it would decrease their in
comes."
Hanna then began his closing argument
in support of the adoption of the Panama
route. The members of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, he said, had been ap
pointed because of their ability, integrity
and engineering skill, and he presented
answers to questions he had propounded
to them. He maintained that both the
Panama and Nicaragua routes were per
fectly feasible and practical, but said the
preponderance of evidence in hand was
in favor of Panama.
Teller of Colorado maintained that
practically there was no authority for
the building of a canal by either the Nica
ragua or the Panama route. If the Nica
ragua route should be determined on the
United States would have to negotiate
with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and if
the Panama route should be adopted our
task with Colombia would be easier.
Ee Cid not think that the American peo
ple had selected any particular route.
They were in favor of the best canal.
He believed the advantages of the Pan
ama route were more considerable than
the Isthmian Canal Commission â¢ had re
ported.
At the conclusion of Carmack's re
marks the isthmian canal question was
laid before the Senate. At some length
Senator Spooler discussed the legal
status of the Panama Canal Company's
property. He engaged in a spirited col-
Joquy with Mitchell of Oregon over' some
phases of the tubject. the latter finally
declaring- "it would be ten years before
a gcod title to the Panama property can
b<? obtained."
A resolution offered several days ago by
Carmack, directing the Civil Service Com
mittee to inquire into the discharge from
the War Department of Miss Rebecca J.
Taylor (for the publication of articles in
newspapers criticising the President),
was called up and Carmack addresed the
Senate in support of the resolution. He
maintained that the requirements of the
civil service law had been flagrantly vio
lated in this case, inasmuch as, he said.
Miss Taylor had had no charges preferred
c^ainst her, nor had she been afforded
opportunity to make answer to any
charges. He maintained that a letter in
quiring whether Miss Taylor was the au
thor of a certain newspaper article and
her admission that she had written the
article did not constitute a charge against
her within the meaning of the civil ser
vice law. He intimated that she was dis
charged "because she took the wrong side
of the Philippine question from the ad
ministration point of view."
The Senate to-day devoted practically
its entire session to consideration of the
canal question. Extended speeches were
delivered by Spooner of Wisconsin and
Hanna of Ohio in advocacy of the adop
tion of the Panama route and Pettus of
Alabama advocated the selection of the
Nicaragua route. Teller of Colorado
briefly announced his support of the Pan
ama project and Jones of Arkansas indi
cated his leaning toward the same route.
Little that is new to the discussion was
developed by any of the speakers.
WASHINGTON*. June IS.â Interest In the
isthmian canal question increases as the
time for a final vote in the Senate ap
proaches. To-morrow at 2 o'clock the
voting on the amendments to the pending
Nicaragua canal bill will begin and a final
disposition of the matter is expected to
be reached soon afterward.

Charges Against a Heferee.
"The sum total of the matter is that
two officers had a dispute with a waiter,
ran among chairs and tables, all the
chairs and tables being deserted at the
time.; that one of tnem upset tables and
chairs and that another called out in
loud tones on the deserted square. -While
some or all , of .the actions may be con
sidered indiscreet or lacking in dignity,
none of them merit a court martial and
none can' be. characterized as bringing
scandal or disgrace' on the naval service,
hence the court of inquiry clears the offi
cers of resisting public authority or un
warrantably attacking the citizens, which
are the principal points on- which the Ital
ian court found the parties guilty. The
court is" relieved of the embarrassment
of bringing the parties to trial, in which
no offense exists, simply to Â¦ keep a ' pos
sible, though entirely unauthorized, prom
ise that a court martial should follow
the court of inquiry. The parties will
be admonished to so conduct themselves
in the future as to avoid,' if possible, a
repetition of the occurrence leading to
this court of inquiry."
"Without this customary assistance all
parties were suffering: revolting Indigni
ties during the period of- their confine
ment and even in court, such as are un
known in the case of the lowest crimin
ology in our own country, and although
these matters are apart from the ques
tion of tho culpability of the persons ar
rested, they are the cause of much of the
notoriety attendant on the case.
"That the matter did come to trial, re
sulting in notovlety detrimental to the
reputation of those involved and to ..the
good name of the service was due at least
in part to omission to observe that cus
tom of the service whereby the command
ing officer of a United States naval ves
sel, in case of. the arrest on shore of one
of his command, himself either makes
immediate and direct representations
for his relief, or appears in court to aid

"After a minute examination it appears
that there was not sufficient evidence ad
duced before the court of inquiry to
establish the allegations against Surgeon
Ledbetter, Lieutenant Doddridge and Cap

shows that the two first named were not
noticeably affected by liquor. The mat
ter acpears to have been forced to trial
on account of representations of civilians
who, were in no way under the authority
of any branch of the Italian Government,

WOODMEN FIND BEDWOOD
GARBED FOR A HOLIDAY
The mineral lands within the five-mile
limit of Pocatello have been "staked" out
and a .large number of conflicts are rc-
T^rted. It developed to-day that the In
dian police yesterday gathered in a num
ber of "sooners," whom they found within
the limit, and held them prisoners till to
day, thus preventing them from gaining
any semblance of title.
: In the line to-day were two women
over 70 years of age, awaiting their turn.
They have spent half their lives on t\ic
reservation. They will not be reached un
til to-morrow, and if it develops that the
lr.nds have been taken by "sooners" seri
ous trouble may follow.
Public sentiment Is .with' these old set
tlers and bloodshed is threatened should
they fail . to regain the land they have
occupied. - , .
There. is much feeling against a num
ber of "sooners," who, it is openly
charged at the land office and on the
streets, were not (A or near the land on
vhich they filed when the reservation
was thrown open at noon yesterday. Sev
eral of these applicants are known, to
have been in Blackfoot yesterday at noon
and their applications will be contested.
'A large number of settlers who have by
sufferance of the Government resided
upon reservation lands from fifteen to
thirty years and who have made valuable
improvements on the Â¦ choice land they
have occupied have had their holdings
filed onâ in some cases by "sooners." The
bill opening the Â»Fort Hall reservation
gave no protection to these old settlers,
be was;done in the ease of the bill open
ing the Kiowa reservation, which was
passed simultaneously with the Fort Hall
bill.
BLACKFOOT, Idaho, June 18.â There
was a steady and persistent flow of ap
plications for claims to Fort 'Hall Indian
reservation land at the Blackfoot Land
Office to-day, and, although there were
many disappointed applicants and much
murmuring, no serious trouble occurred.
Many contests are being filed and blood
shed is expected when some of these are

and for a long time prior thereto, the said de
fendants, contriving -and maliciously intend

SAN FRANCISCO. May 25 (exclusive dis
patch). â The Call makes a sensational exposure
of what it claims is the rendering of false ac
counts by Warden Aguirre or San Quentin
prison in order to conceal the purchase ot vari
ous articles of luxury for household use,
amounting to $112 13. The San Francisco Call
links Governor Gage with this fraud, as it de
clares that the Governor was a frequent guest
at Aguirre's house and enjoyed the luxuries
bought with the State money.
After setting forth at length the alleged
interest and purpose of the article and its
alleged effect on the plaintiff's good name
and reputation, the complaint closes as
follows:
The complaint filed in the County
Clerk's office is a long document, quite
similar to the one filed recently in San
tedro, charging the proprietor and man
ager of the San Francisco Call with
criminal libel. It cites that "on or about
the 2Gth day of May, 1902, said defendants
did maliciously and falsely print and pub
lish and cause to be printed and pub
lished in a regular issue of their said
newspaper, to wit, the L03 Angeles Times,
dated May 26, 1W)2, the following false,
scandalous and malicious libel and def
amation in printing ot and concerning
said plaintiff, to wit."
Reference is then specifically made to
an article published In the San Francisco
Cail and telegraphed to the Los Angeles
Times, which, omitting the legal verbiage,
is quoted as follows:

The administration Senators to-night,
however, see little or no probability of
the Cuban bill passing:. It is freely pre
dicted that at the adjourned conference
Friday night the v/hole matter will be
dropped. The beet sugar men are moro
jubilant than ever.
A vague hope of possible success for
reciprocity was Inspired to-day by the
action of the Republican steering com
mittee in deciding in favor of reporting:
the bill to the Senate and placing it on
the calendar. The effect of this would be
to insure discussion on the floor of tha
Senate and bring the measure to a vote.
It is the very thing that prominent mem
bers of the party who have not been in
terfering in the Cuba matter one way or
the other seek to avoid.
There wa3 no friction, no ! sensational
statements, only a general defiance of the
President and the party. At the close
Senators Aldrich and Elkina, leaders of
the two factions, walked calmly away
arm in arm and engaged in conversation
about the prospects of adjournment and
the beautiful moon.
There was only a perfunctory appeal
for the administration and harmony. Senr
ator Allison, chairman of the caucus.
*poke a few words by way of introduc
tion; Senator Platt of Connecticut pro
duced the Cuban bill, and Senator
Alarich called attention to it as an admin
istration measure. The only result of the
meeting was to point out more plainly
that Cuban reciprocity . by legislation la
dead, with no hope of resurrection.

FOR PATRICK A. McHTJGH
LOS ANGELES, June 18.â According to
a story printed here, a solution has been
found for the mystery .surrounding the
life of the late Charles Hill, who died
several weeks ago in the Good Samaritan
Hospital, friendless and alone, leaving a
fortune of 1142,200 in a safe deposit box.
George Hayes, private secretary to Gen
eral A. L. New, has come forward with
the information that Hill was a seafar
ing man and former! y lived in Mystic,
Conn., where Hayes knew him and his
brother.' Mason C. Hill. The latter owned
and operated a shipyard at Mystic and
was alive at last accounts. The brother
has a family, consisting- of two sons and
a married daughter." -
The old man who died here is identified
with the Mystic sea captain by the fact
that Hayes met him on the street in Los
Angeles a few days before his death and
talked with him of their old home in the
Connecticut town. Hayes says that he
kept track of Hill until 1883, when he was
believed to have gone to San Antonio,
Tex. For the greater part of the time
previous to that year Hill was In the em
ploy of the C H. Maliory Company,
which operated a line of vessels between
New York and Galveston, Tex. Hayes is
certain that his acquaintance, Charles Hill
of Mystic. Conn., whom he met on the
streets of Los Angeles, is the same
Charles Hill who died In the hospital. He
has placed the facts In the hands of the
Public Administrator, who will communi
cate with the relatives in Connecticut.

FRESNO. June 18.â The first session
of the State convention of the Ep
worth League of the Methodist
Church South will, be held in
this city to-morrow morning,
and will continue four days. Already
the city contains many delegates, 150 be
ing gathered here from various parts of
the State. Many more are expected to ar
rive before the end of the week; together
with scores of visitors from points near by.
To-night a reception to the Leaguers
was given in St. Paul's Church and every
thing possible was done to show them the
""warm hospitality that Fresnoans are
capable of according. A special feature
of the evening was the -singing of the
Epworth chorus, consisting of seventy
voices, which was organized here some
months ago, and which has for several
weeks been practicing in preparation 'for
last night's entertainment. The best
musical and literary talent of the citV
assisted in the programme. * â¢ â¢ -
The session of the Fresno District Ep
worth League was Held yesterday. There
was an attendance of about forty del
egates. Robert Poole of Visalia, president
of the district league, presided.
"We are Hood River men," one of the
five said, "and we are going after that
$3000 offered for Tracy and Merrill."
The names of the party were given as
S. F. Louts, Harry Hampshire, James
Hughes, James Moberly ancf Alexander
Gillespie. They are farmer boys, who are
used to hunting bear In the woods about
the base of Mount Hood, and the dogs
they have along have good records as
bear trailers. The party left for La Cen
ter to take up the trail of the fugitives.
It is reported by Detective Kerrigan of
Portland, who returned here to-niglu,
that Sheriff Huntington of Cowlltz Coun
ty, between which and Clark County the
upper fork of Lewis River is the dividing
line, has taken up the search on the
north side of the river and has posted
men to guard all crossings, while Sheriff
Marsh still maintains armed watchers on
the Clark County side of the river.
PORTLAND, Or.. June 18.â A crowd of
five convict hunters stepped off the Ore
gon Navigation train this morning when
it arrived at the station.
VANCOUVER, Wash., June 18.â Tn"e
search for Harry Tracy and David Mer
rill, the escaped convicts from the Ore
gon penitentiary, has been abandoned for
t'ie present by the posse which has made
this city its headquarters for the past
three days, and the majority of the offi
cers, detectives and militiamen returneu
to Vanconver this evening, weary from
their long vigil and chagrined over their
failure to bring d<Avn their human game.
The fugitives have not been seen since
yesterday evening, when they passed
Nicholson's farm, near Pioneer, on horse
back. The general opinion among the pur
euers is that the outlaws are still in the
woods south of Lewis River. A close
v.atch has been kept at all crossings of
the river, and the officers do not believe
that the desperadoes crossed the stream
last night or to-day.
Proof that the convicts are in the tim
ber along Lewis River came to-day in a
report by a man named Lindsley, who has
a logging camp in that vicinity. He in
formed the officers that the convicts ap
peared at his place in the woods late last
evening and demanded supper, which was
given to them. After supper they went
away, but in which direction the inform
ant could not tell.
A mining man who returned to Arizona
to-day from the country where Dunham
Is supposed to be In hiding brings the
Information that it is pretty well known
through that section that a California
detective is on his way to Sonora to
capture Dunham. It Is the prevailing
opinion there that Dunham will never be
taken alive. They say that if Dunham
i6 stationed where he Is claimed to be,
he is surrounded by some of the . most
notorious desperadoes in Mexico and
that Edson is . more likely to get
a bullet in his head than to capture the
murderer. However, Edson has many
friends among the Mexicans in Sonora
and he expresses such great confidence
in the success of his errand that many
Tucsonians believe that he has positive
arsurance from his Sonora friends that
Dunham Is as good as captured already â
in other words, that he has "something
up his sleeve" and is aided by powerful
influences in Mexico.
While in Tucson Edson used every pos
eible means to conceal his presence from
newspaper men and others who might
betray his errand. He did not register
a.t his hotel and when he wanted to go
to the office of his local attorney for
consultation he took a closed carriage.
Edson said to an intimate friend that he
had not yet procured the necessary ex
tradition papers through the Governor
of California, but that he had made pro
vision to get them from Sacramento and
Washington, D. C, Just as soon as he
advised the officials by wire that he had
captured his man.
TUCSON, Ariz., June 18.â Juan Edson,
the former peace officer of San Jose,
Cal., claims to have James C. Dunham
as good as captured. He stopped in Tuc
son to-day on his way to Sonora, whtre
he believes he has located the sextuple
murderer of the McGlincy family. Edson
made a positive statement here to confi
dential friends that he expected to be
back in Arizona with his - man in ten
days, or two weeks at the latest.
Edson was In Sonora last fall, working
on the Stassforth divorce case, and at
that time asked certain friends to look
out for Dunham. The latter say they
have found their man at a place in the
Sierra Madre mountains three hundred
miles by wagon road and trail from the
nearest station on the Sonora railroad.
Edson left this afternoon for Torres,
where 'he will be joined by a trustworthy"
Mexican sruide. He is familiar with many
parts of Sonora, but feared to rely upon
his own resources while the Yaquls were
ir.aking so much trouble in that country.
Edson delayed his trip on account of the
Yaqui raid" but is reassured by repcrrts
that the Yaquis have been pacified in
tnany Quarters.

FEARS HIS BOY

would not have undertaken the feat but
for the wager made by Morrisey. His
ambition is to catch a turnip dropped

Bedini performed the feat in Chicago

who crowded before the Masonic Temple.
He stood in front of the building in his

dropped he caught it on the fork. Two
men stood behind him to prevent him
from falling. It may not be generally
known but it'is a' fact that the velocity
of the turnip equals nearly 200 pounds
weight when it . reaches de sidewalk.
Bedini is confident that he can do th9
trick. He only asks the privilege of three
tries. He claims the wind at the corner
of Third and Market streets is so great
that it may veer the turnip out of its
course. . Â¦ . â¢ â¢
Manager John Morrisey of the Orpheum
has wagered half a dozen cases of wine
with Ned Greenway, the well known so
ciety leader, that Bedini will perform the
difficult feat. Mayor Schmltz has granted

The deceased ,was only 17 years of age.
She was married in Oregon when i but 15
and. came. alone to this city last fall and
became a denizen of the tenderloin. Her
foster-mother, who resides In Aledford,
Gr.-j' notified the authorities here, and De
tective Coleman : was detailed to find
Adah: On learning . that she was mar
ried Coleman abandoned the search, as
nothing could be done by the police au
thorities. The unfortunate woman drank
heavily, and her suicide evidently was a
maudlin "freak.

Adah. Castillo, who was also known as
Gwin Gqrdon, committed suicide Tuesday
night by asphyxiating herself with illu
minating gas -in .her -room at 34 Eddy
street. She was discovered dead in bed
yesterday morning with the gas fully
turned on. The. door was locked and the
key was on the inside, so that an en
trance had to be effected through a win
dow. On the dresser was a note, written

Chief Wittman, on being served with
the injunction . papers, consulted' District
Attorney Byington, who said he would
look into the matter and advise him to
day.
During the day Mark Shaughnessy, who
represents Young Gibbs, one of the box
ers, declared all negotiations for a fight
off. He insisted upon the club officials
posting a forfeit of $500 in gold coin to be
forfeited to the boxers if they fail to
promote the contest. The forfeit not be
ing forthcoming the match was not made.
This leaves the club without any stand
ing in court. It is expected other men
will be substituted for Neill and Gibbs. I
The restraining order, which was issued
by Judge Murasky; yesterday is returnable
before Judge Sloss Friday, June 20.
The order was issued on the petition of
James Neill,' Edward Wilson and. J. D.
Gibbs. The petitioners contend that the
ordinance under which the Board; of Su
pervisors-grant permits for boxing con
tests is unconstitutional, and seek to
bring the matter before the courts by in
junction proceedings. Wilson, Neill and
Gibbs claim they have a right to promote
boxing contests as individuals and se
cured thtf order under that guise. The
ordinance, they, claim, /does' not give the
Supervisors power to refuse any ''individ
ual" a permit, as it provides only for or
ganized clubs. -â¢- â¢-..;. .

CHICAGO, June 18.â J. B. Respess*
Uelle's Commoner, an outsider in the bet
ting in the American Derby, which will
be run here Saturday, won the Derby
trial special to-day at Harlem. The colt
ran a marvelous race, covering the mile
and an eighth in 1:53 2-5. Ho won in a
gallop by three lengths. John A. Drake's
Av'yeth, in a desperate drive, beat out
Lucien Appleby a nose. Prowl, which
was fourth, was beaten â¢ ten lengths.
Cruzados, second choice in the American
Derby, quit after he had- gone a mile. The
race nearly caused the .death' of Jockey
Winkfield. The colored boy: had the
mount on S. C. Hildreth/s McChesney,
which, coupled with Lucien Appleby, was
held favorite at 1 to 2. At the half-mile
j;ole McChesney fell, throwing Winkfield
against the rail. Winkfield's right leg
Â¦was injured badly and his collarbone
broken.
Mcrley played Lawler in right field, and
he, performed some wonderful stunts. He
robbed Shay of a triple in the fifth with
a one-hand catch, and had five chances
in the field. Jackson, the ex-New Yorker
whom Morley has signed, will arrive to
day. Kane will again do box duty this
afternoon and Waddell will try to fool
the Ponies. The score:

Rube WaddelUhit the ball over the
Garden wall in the third, scoring^ Toman
from second. This is the first time the
trick has been turned on the Oakland
dismond this season, so Rube won several
prizes in the way of shoes, _clothes and
many other articles donated by charitable
shopkeepers, who like to see the ball
tossers dress like members of the swag
ger set.
Kane was just a trifle wilder than usual,
and the locals were fortunate in winning
v^hen playing behind him. He gave nine
free trips to first, but the Angel3 never
seemed able to hit him hard. He walked
McPartlin in the tenth, when all stations
had a man aboard, and forced Roach
from third. Luck was with the Ponies,
however, and they batted well behind the
erratic twirler, landing on McPartlin for
fifteen safe drives.
Shay played third for the Ponies and
acted like a"' man indulging in . a beauty
sleep. In the third, after two had scored
and two more were occupying places on
the pillows, he fumbled , a drive from
Keilly's stick and then threw the ball to
third when no one was there to receive
it. Consequently two more runs were
sccred, and chances looked bad for the
locals.
All kinds of .baseball were handed to
the fans during the fracas. There were a
few clever plays and a great many more
dummy acts. .The unanimous opinion of
those on the spot â¢ was that the gallant
Charley Reilly should take all the blame
for losing to Harris. With two out and
two on the bags in the eighth Kane sent a
slow one to third. Reilly fielded the ball,
but Instead of throwing the runner out
at first, he attempted to catch Shugart,
who was tearing- toward third. He failed.
Then the Ponies began to take many rides
on' McPartlin's slow offerings and tied up
the score.
The Angel contingent of ball tossers ar
rived from; the south at -the break of day
yesterday and all sprinted in the direction
of Cal Ewing's playground to break some
ball records. They were doing the act^for
s. few innings, and the betting odds were
something like 29 to VA that the Ponies
would finish second. It all ended other
than Morley had calculated, as the Ponies
finally awoke from their dreams and
landed the race in the tenth heat. Score,
7 to 6. . â¢ .
DENVER, Colo., June 18.â The Denver
Fire and Police Board to-day issued in

With the opening of the fall semester
of that year Dave Coolidge, Stanford
'32, well known for his contributions of
animal stories to the Youth's Companion
and other periodicals, leased the "camp"
from Mrs. Stanford, laid out walks and
flower beds about the cottages and fur
nished all the rooms. The plan of the
"camp" was not co-operative, but Cool
idge was able to manage it successfully
and rent rooms to students for $2 50 per
month, or $3 for two men in a room. In
1SS7 three co-operative eating clubs were
formed in the "camp" by students from
Encina Hall, the big boys' dormitory.
These were named the "Maison Riche."
the "Maison Dore" and the "Sobel Eta
Pi," the last a mock fraternity, which
derived its name from a tradition that
" # Giff" Sobei, 1900, once ate a real pie. It
was considered a great honor as well as
a great economy to be a member of one
of these clubs.
rAMOTJS OLD BUILDINGS
AT STANFORD DOOMED
Cluster of Cottages Known as ths
"O-mp" to Give Way to Modern
Structures.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. June 18.â
The Stanford "camp," which has come
to be regarded by university men as al
most a part of their alma mater, has at
last, like the State- farm, become a thing
of the past. Its destruction has just been
completed and the giound will soon be
cleared and the foundations laid for the
new engineering buildings, which are to
take its place. The "camp" was first
built, when the cornerstone of the uni
versity was laid, in 18S7. It formed a
rough quadrangle of hastily constructed
â¢whitewashed cottages, and served merely
to accommodate the workmen who were
busy laying- out the university buildings.
In 1S91. when the university was opened,
a number of students found accommoda
tions with the workmen, and they all
lived together in true bohemian style,
eacn man cooking his meals in his own
room. When the inner quadrangle was
finally completed, in 18&4, the "camp," as
the rough buildings gradually came to be
called, was left Â«itirely to the students,
though it did ndt come under student
manasement until 1S&7.
"Well, if you insist, you can have it.
I only carry it for self-protection. The
mesmerist carries a gun, and if I meet
him I'll shoot him the same as I would
a dog."
Then McAllister went on to tell more
of his troubles and how he had gone to
A!banv on a steamer in order to get rest
and had been followed by people in a con
spiracy to injure him. His friends have
been notified of his detention.
"Do you carry a revolver?" asked the
canltary officer, and requested that Mc-
Allister give it to him when he replied In
the affirmative.
"But he was unable to put -me under
the spell," cried McAllister, "and the pub
lic knows 1 am innocent."
Then McAllister told how he had been
chlded and ridiculed by his companions,
â¢who enjoyed his misfortune. They sent
a mesmerist to him, and he was perse
cuted so much that he left Newark and
Â¦went to New York to work in a carriage
factory. A mesmerist dogged his move
ments."
"They told me she was dead," he ex
plained, "but I learned better, for I went
to her wedding -and saw her enter and
leave the churcn."
Sanitary Officer Frank, whose business
it is to examine demented persons,
learned all about McAllister's troubles.
All his bad luck, McAllister declared, be
gan with disappointment in love. He was
engaged to be married, but his sweet
titart went back on him.
The doorkeepers declined to let him in.
He told them he lived at 45 Crawford
street, Newark, N. J., and was 45 years
old. He probably would have . related
more, but they sent him to the police. He
was locked up pending an examination of
his mental condition. !

GEORGE WASHINGTON'S QUEUE.
It Hid a Luxuriant Suit of Straight
and Very Dark Hair.
The father of his country concealed a
luxuriant suit of hair beneath his queue
wig. Many now wish the old fashion
were in vogue to conceal thinned hair or
baldness.. Yet no one need have thin- hair
nor be. bald, if he cure the dandruff that
causes both. Dandruff cannot be cured by
scouring the scalp, because it Is a germ
disease and the germ has to be killed.
Newbro's Herpicide kills the dandrutf
germâ no other hair â¢ preparation will.
"Destroy the cause, you remove the t-r-
fect." There's no cure for dandruff but
to kill the germ. â¢ ' .

Wfc will loan you. the money for a regular banking
rate of interestâ six per cent. "And you. can pay us
back little by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the first-class' furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big and fresh and where satisfaction is certain, and
when you have made your selection you can pay your
bill in full with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
and being compelled to select your goods from smaller
and inferior stocks?
The installment stores charge you ten per cent
above their cash prices when you ask for long credit
All you pay us is six per cent. .
For example:. If your purchases amount to $10000
we will charge you S106.00â which is- a six per cent
advance: then y 6" u. pay us $26.00 cash and the balance
in monthly payments .amounting to $8.60 each month
If your purchases amount to $75-03 we will charge you
$79-50; you make us a .cash payment on this of $1500
and pay the balance at the easy rate of. $6.45 per j
â¢ Â» You save four per cent. Yon have the Â¦ arcat privi-
lege of buying in a first-class store, and yet. you get
all the advantages of the easy payment plan as offered
bythe installment houses! Â«â¢-
No amount of money is too small, for us to loan
Worth looking into, don't you, think?

All of those enterprises which facilitate commerce,
develop the country and profit its people have to be
instituted by foreign capital and the energy of aliens.
When their investments become valuable it is Â¦ the
habit of the revolutionary chief who is in power to
seize them. The owners then appeal in vain for jus

Â¦If the current revolution in Venezuela promised an
improvement in government it would be worthy of
approval. But there is no probability that it has any
higher motive than envy of the results of Castro's
greed, for he has imitated Blanco as far as his genius
and opportunity could do so. He has gone to great
lengths in the spoliation of aliens, and his excesses in
that direction may open the way to teach his country
a lesson in good government.
We are in the habit of going to the Old World, to
the history of Verres and other Roman rulers, for
stories of rapacity. A study of conditions in some of
the Latin- American states will reveal more pic
turesque spoliation, by revolutionary governments,
than Roman history can furnish. The record of Dr.
Guzman Blanco, who seized the government of
Venezuela and ruled the country like. a magnificent
bandit for a long period, is rich in incidents that
show the persistence of the Roman habit in these
remote congeners of the Latins. Blanco's greatest
rival appears to be General Simon Sam, a Latin
negro, who has been driven from the Presidency of
Hayti with an accumulation of eight millions, won
by thrift and official economy of honesty in eight
years 1
THE stubborn character and persistence of the
revolution in Venezuela seem to imply the
downfall of Castro and his Government. Like
a majority of the Latin- American Governments, that
of Venezuela gets its executive changes by revolu
tion and not by the orderly process of law. That
system hinders the civic and material development of
the country. When a revolution is in progress the
property of all citizens is in danger of seizure, and
for that reason capital is not used by the natives in
commercial development. No matter how rich the
country may be the people remain poor because
whatever wealth their labor wins is liable to seizure
and confiscation.'-

splendid production of "Romeo and

tained. The whole sixteen scenes are
given with prolouges, quite in the Shakes

among these is the first scene, a street,
where the setting conduces to complete

also of the handsomest, and the whole

W T hat remains to be seen is whether the party in
backing away from Mr. Bryan can back into con
fidence of the country.
But, let who may be discussed, Mr. Bryan is pay
ing the penalty of mistaking notoriety for fame.
Fame is enduring. Notoriety is as effervescent as
sodawater, and, when the bubbles are gone, as flat.
It is doubtful whether he could influence even a
fusion convention in Nebraska, where he used to be
a prophet, seer and . revelator of the first class. ".''â¢".
The party would be glad to find a gentleman of the
old school, who roaches his hair like James Buchanan
or wears a sideboard collar like Stephen A. Doug
las, but they are scarce in the market Of all the re
cent leaders who were put in cold storage by Mr.
Bryan Senator Gorman is considered the most avail
able, though in the Middle States and the South
there is detected a strong undertow for Don M.
Dickinson of Michigan, who seems to have a certain
influence all over the country that may compel other
candidates to reckon with him.
Here and there the party has found itself able to
sit up and notice things since' it quit playing with*
silver. I; has recovered Maryland and given her the
doubtful blessing of trading Gorman for Welling
ton. Mr. Thomas Taggart has carried Indianapolis
for Mayor as a gold Democrat, and Mr. Wells, an
other gold-plated Democrat, has been elected Mayor
of St Louis against Mr. Bryan's tearfu? protest.
Now the Buckeye balk of a year ago is pointedly fol
lowed by Indiana. ... Under the lead of Mr. Taggart,
John R. Wilson and John P. Frenzel the Hoosier
Democracy has marched out of the Bryan camp and
rtfuses to i.dmit that it ever heard of him. He is
driven from the field as a candidate, and it is not cer
tain that he can retain enough power to influence the
nomination of any one in 1904. He is at work with
currycomb and brush grooming Tom Johnson, but
that gentleman's ambition has prostrated him at. the
wrong time.
The party is not likely to nominate another politi
cal freak, after its two trying experiences with'
Bryan. Even if it want to go to the sideshows for
a candidate # there are others more picturesque than
the Cleveland curiosity. Webster Davis was alive at
last accounts, and so was Cyclone Davis of Texas,
and, passing out of the Davis patch, General Weaver
was never Ajax enough to defy the lightning of any
kind of a nomination, and has been hit twice, once in
1880 by the Greenback and again in 1892 by the
Populist nomination. If a real freak is needed his
experience is valuable. But it is not likely that a
freak will be wanted.
That revolt was really the beginning of that with
drawal from Bryan that has been going on ever
since. He has railed at it and has made pilgrimages
to stop it, but it goes on just the same. His last
lcctitre tour in the South was a failure. In towns
where six years ago the people trampled on each
ether to see him and strained their ears to hear him
he could not half fill the hall, ordered the money re
turned and refused to speak.
ABOUT a year ago the Ohio Democracy met,
transacted business, made a platform, nomi
nated a ticket and adjourned without in
dorsing Bryan or his platforms. The forgotten
leader let fly at that convention and came near ad
vising that its ticket be bolted. Bolting is not
necessar}', however, to beat any kind of a Demo
cratic ticket in Ohio, and the*Â£arty had for its cam
paign labor the sole reward of sloughing Mr. Bryan
snd his issues, and it felt in better health, even after
defeat, than it had enjoyed since 1896.

This advice" has been followed in Connecticut,
where such a union has elected the Mayor of every,
large- city and expects to capture the State govern
ment at the fall election. The present extensive
strikes only demonstrate . the universality of organi
zation and the power of its leaders, and the students
of government and the observers' of events will watch
the results with the keenest interest.
A year ago the Palladium, New Haven, Conn.,
said: "There are enough wage-workers in the
United States and in every State to sway Congress
and Legislatures if they will cast aside every other
consideration, unite as one body and vote only for
men whom they can trust and for measures that will
be helpful to them. There are enough workingmen
if they will unite, to elect' Presidents, Governors,
Judges and majorities in every Congressional elec
tion."
That is a strong statement of conditions with
which the Civic Federation has to contend in com
posing these labor troubles, and it also reveals with
much clearness the alien source of many of the ideas
which are influential with great -numbers in this
country who are eligible to citizenship, and, as a rule,
hasten to acquire it by naturalization. '
The Detroit Free Press, commenting on it some
time ago, said: "Suppose such a scheme were pro
posed in this country! It would be denounced as
monstrous and fought to defeat. The cry of personal
liberty would be raised in behalf of those who wanted
to work. Hatred of such governmental tyranny
would sweep the land. Any attempt of official au
thority to say when men might do legitimate work
and earn an honest living and when they must suffer
the evils of enforced idleness would be crushed as
would be an attempt to establish an absolute mon
archy! Yet this very, thing is being done by an
authority that is without an element of governmental
power. It is by an organization that does not have
the power of an ordinary corporation. Yet its ar
bitrary dictum is that when it concludes to stop work
in the field of labor no one else must take up the
abandoned tasks, no matter how reputable as citi
zens those outside the organization may be, no mat
ter how much they may need wages' for themselves
and families. They are hunted and attacked as out
laws. They are not safe even under protection of
armed- troops and the police. They have violated no
law, human or divine, yet, .to the eternal shame of
this land of universal freedom and equality, they are
hounded and persecuted by those who make their own
laws and defy those of the country. If Government
legislated that such things should be the nation would
be in revolt. Why stand it from a subordinate and ut
terly unauthorized source? There is no intelligence
nor common sense which holds the right' to strike
superior to the right not to strike."
The Minister of Commerce in the French Cabinet
that recently resigned brought to the front a policy
with which this country is being made familiar by
passing events. He was a radical socialist, and pro
posed that when one labor organization struck for
any cause^all labor should cease, a general strike
being made compulsory by law, and any man who
dared to work being subject to arrest and punish
ment. Such a policy has never yet been considered
within the legitimate powers of government of any
form or kind, and no doubt if it had been adopted in
France it would have caused a profound disturbance.
It is well that everybody see things as they are and
that in looking at a question so serious there be no
illusions. If immigration fill the vacancies for labor
which annually occur the increase, in our native
population will be left without the 'opportunity of
gainful employment. There are already many ( dis
quieting indications that this is taking place and that
immigrant labor, by the' power of organization, is
able to outlaw labor that is native born. The Civic
Federation finds its task in settling, strikes to be diffi
cult, because it has to meet and reason with an ele
ment that has not assimilated American ideas of per
sonal liberty.
This immigration is a daily increment to our labor
ing population, and, under the conditions that
unionism has created in all sections of the country, it
will soon reach such formidable proportions as to
tax the resources of the country for support, or it
must be absorbed into the unions, or it must be per
mitted to labor. as non-union. As its'drift isiagainst
the Atlantic seaboard the most of it lodges there,
and there at present is the scene of the greatest vio
lence and the most numerous strikes.
THE year" has so far been characterized by an
unusual number of labor strikes, and these. by
much violence. It is a portentous. condition of
affairs ' when the labor already in the country, is at
war, manifested by the idleness of tens of thousands
of strikers, by the violence with which their demands
are urged, by their refusal to permit non-union men
to work at all, and, concurrently with all this, the
largest foreign immigration that has been known in
our history. * Â¦Â¦Â¦'; .

Now, after all the efforts of The Call to bring the
whole of this matter to light, this Henry T. Gage,
whose ways are dark, proceeds to get out a warrant
for a dark lantern arrest. If ever there were a dis
play of a smaller mind and a meaner temper than that
we have never heard of it; nor, indeed, has any one
else unless it be some scientist who has made a
study of the life history of a microbe.
It will be remembered, moreover, that at first Gage
declared he was not affected by the charges, stating
in an official interview that The Call had not charged
him with knowingly participating in the frauds;
nevertheless he, too^refrained from taking steps for
a public investigation. He made a secret inquiry,
however, and would probably have kept it secjet if
The Call had not exposed it.
For that opportunity they have been asking from
the start The Call urged the State Board of Prison
Directors to make an investigation, and it will be re
membered that after the first exposure The Call
stopped the publication of further evidence of fraud
so that the inquiry might not be prejudiced. It was
not until the Directors postponed investigation that
The Call resumed the publication of the evidence
showing violations of the law and the commission of
various kinds of fraud by the prison management.
It matters little to the proprietor and the manager
of The Call when the arrest is made. The warrants
may be served upon them at any time. They have no
other desire than to get a hearing in court at once.
They will ask nothing except an opportunity to sub
mit all the evidence bearing upon the case.
What was there working in the petty brain and
spiteful heart of Henry T. Gage when he pbtained
that warrant for a midnight arrest?
Why was it that the constable to whom it was first
given for service declined the duty and passed the
warrant over .to the Sheriff's office?
If it were not the intention of Gage to have the
arrest made at night why did he go to the trouble to'
have the warrant so indorsed?
What was the object of that? Did Gage believe
he could get a constable or some other officer to
come to San Francisco unheralded, make a spec
tacular midnight arrest, handcuff the proprietor and
the manager of The Call and carry them through the
State as desperate criminals to answer before the
court at San Pedro?
An illustration of the nature of the man is afforded
by the fact that in obtaining the warrants for the ar
rest of the proprietor and the manager of The Call
he induced the Justice of the Peace by whom it was
issued to direct that it might be served at any time,
day or night. Under our law a warrant for arrest
for a misdemeanor can be served only in the daytime
unless the court directs otherwise and so indorses the
warrant. In seeking that direction and indorsement
in this case Gage put it in the power of the officer of
the court to come to San Francisco and arrest. the
defendants at midnight, dragging them from their
beds if he chose to do so.
His- motive in bringing action -for criminal libel
against the proprietor and the manager of The Call at
Wilmington Township â at a distance remote from
the scene of the offenses and the homes of the wit
nesses, far away from the prison and the ; State capi
tal, where much of the documentary evidence in the
case is on file â could have been none other than a
mean one. It could have been designed for no other
purpose than that of annoying the defendants and
making the trial vexatious. Nothing of any value
is to be gained by Gage in compelling the attendance
of the "defendants and their witnesses at that distant
point, and the only possible satisfaction he can de
rive from the trick is that of gratifying a petty malice
and a mean spirit.
WHEN Henry T. Gage in the office of Gov
ernor of California first disclosed the pet
tiness of his mind by spiteful treatment of
Republican members of the Legislature who refused
to vote- for Dan Burns for the United States Senate
it was said of him': "He is not broad gauge, nor
even narrow gauge. . He is just a slot in a cable
track." Since those early days of his administration
he has continued his slot career, and now in dealing
with the exposure of the frauds at San Quentin he is
showing himself more spiteful and more petty than
ever.

Fahey, who died in this city January 3,
1901, to obtain $15,000 and also property
situated on the northeast corner of Pa
cific and Taylor streets, all of which ho
claims belongs to him under a contract
entered into between himself and Mrd.
Fahey. .
There were- two contracts made. Tha
first was drawn up in 1884 in Dublin, Ire
land, where Travers lived with his father,
a wealthy land owner. In the same year
Travera met Mrs. Fahey, who was travel
ing with her daughter Teresa in the old
country. 'Mrs. lahey took a fancy to
Travers, as did her daughter, and an,
agreement . was reached, under which,
Travera was to receive $15,000 and thÂ©
property mentioned, providing he married
Teresa and went to San Francisco to live.
Travers married the daughter and came
to San Francisco, much against the will
of his father, so he says. On arriving
bere he demanded that Mrs. Fahey fulfill
her part in the contract, whereupon Mrs.
Fahey stated that it would be Impossible)
for her to do so, as she had a number oÂ£
large demands to pay on her property,
but proposed that they enter into a new
contract, making the debt payable upon
her death. Travers, wishing to be agree
able, consented to the second contract,
and all went smoothly until June, 1S9Â«,
when, during the absence of Travera, his
wife brought a suit for divorce on the
ground of desertion, but at her own re
quest the case was dismissed. Later, In
May, 1900, while in Chicago, Travera
brought suit for divorce on the ground of
desertion and succeeded in getting a de
cree. The only child, a boy of 13 years,
was given into the care of the little fel
low's mother upon the consent of Travers.
Although Travers has written many
times to his former wife, asking permis
sion to visit his son, his letteÂ»s have been
unanswered, he says.
Travers will later ask the court to ar
renge that he be allowed to see his son.
Mrs. Fahey died on July 3, 1901, having
made no arrangements for the payment
of her alleged debt. No part of it has
been _pald. Shortly after the death of
Mrs. Fahey Mrs. Travers married Joseph
F. Maloney of Oakland. They are living
there at present. â¢-'-

Who Makes a Slighting ]}
Remark.
George Biscar was arrested last even
ing by Policeman Max "Fenner for taking
a shot at* J. Kauruzar on Jessie street.
According to the complaining witness'
story he was returning home from work
when he met Biscar and made an un

mediately drew ' a revolver and fired a
shot at- him. Kauruzar grappled with
his, assailant and wrested the revolver
from him, the weapon becoming emptied
of cartridges In the struggle. .Biscar ran
away and was pursued by Kauruzar witn
the empty revolver.
The two men raced up First street to
Montgomery street, thence to Bush street,
where the crowd disarmed Kauruzar, un
der the impression that. he was following
Biscar with the intention of killing him.
Policeman Fenner took both men to the
Hall of Justice, where the tale wag final
ly unraveled. Biscar denied shooting at
Kauruzar, but there were several wit
nesses who bore out Kauruzar's state
ment. . , â¢. â¢
The trouble between the two men is
said to have arisen over attentions paid"
by Biscar to Kauruzar's mother.
Robert Crowley, a Well-Known
Salesman, Is Badly Injured
Near San Mateo. ,
Robert Crowley, who for twenty years
has been a salesman in the employ of
Murphy, Grant & Co., met with a se
rious accident yesterday morning, and as
a result suffered the amputation of his
left leg below the knee. Crowley and a
friend were taking a bicycle ride in the
vicinity of San Mateo. While endeavor
ing either to pass or to get out of the
way of a heavy wagon Crowley was
knocked from his wheel and fell beneath
the wheels of the wagon. One of the
wheels passed over his left leg below the
knee, shattering the limb in a frightful
manner. The injured man was taken to
St. Mary's Hospital in this city. He was
placed under the influence of anesthetics,
and after the injury had been carefully
examined it was decided that in order to
eave his life the limb would have to be
amputated directly below the knee. The
operation was successfully performed by
Dr. Bailey.

Moore may make restitution to the tune
of $S, or he may decide to reckon the
amount as on parole.
Walter S. Moore began his work for
the State as a common field deputy. For
meritorious services in- looking after the
political health of the "business adminis
tration" he was complimented on the
field by the Hon. Daniel Kevane in per
son and promoted on the spot to the
grade of sanitary inspector. Thirteen
vouchers were filed by Moore. Voucher
No. 619 covers expenses of sanitary in
spection at Dunsmuir and vicinity.
Voucher No. 31S7 contains an item of
$11 So for railroad fare from Dunsmuir to
San Francisco.
Another surprising fact is revealed by a
study of the official disbursements for
health promotion. Walter Moore did not
get but $S more than his share. Citizens
of Los Angeles who are familiar with
Moore's methods and know something of
the enterprise he displays in reaching the
public treasury will at first be inclined
to dispute this assertion, but The Call is
prepared to produce the proof, in the
shape of a transcript of the vouchers op
file in the Controller's office. His account
seems at first giance to be larger than
Fehneman' s, as it contains more items
than are embraced in his comrade's reck
oning, but the aggregate of the cums
drawn is only $1008. This is $S more than
his share on an equal division of the en
tire appropriation to one hundred of the
Los Angeles push.
WALTER MOORE'S ACCOUNT.
In deference to the many inquiries from
the south. The Call has obtained from the
official records the amounts paid from the
health appropriation to a brace of the
most gitted push belonging to the Los
Angeles transplantâ Ben Fehneman and
Walter Moore. The vouching for Fehne
man began in May. 1901, with voucher
No. 15,477. on which he obtained $246 66 of
the taxpayers' money from the State
treasury. On voucher 16,376, in June, 1901,
he drew $154 S4 from the public crib; on
voucher 221 in July lie pulled out $200. For
six consecutive months thereafter on
vouchers numbered respectively 1310; 2241,
23S3, 4333. 4952 and 6336 he drew $100 per
month. On voucher 6529, January, 1902, he
got S50. At the outset or the graft he
served the business administration as
"San Francisco secretary" and "acting
secretary." Later on he figured on the
payroll as "purchasing agent." To the
Los Angeles push rank counts but little.
Hence it is not material to indicate the
amount drawn as' "secretary" and the
amount collected as "purchasing agent."
It all came out of Gage's health appro
priation of $100,000.
The event which is bound to create a
sensation in the camp of the southern
push is that Fehneman has received
$1251 50, whereas according to fair divi
sion with the other ninety-nine of the
push gang he should have obtained but
$1000.
The chief mogul of the business ad
ministration does not announce that he
will disburse the amount claimed from
General Otis in the same style that he
expended the sum obtained from the State
treasury, but it is obvious to every one
that his campaign is in sore need of help.
FEHNEMAN WELL CARED TOR.
Gage wants an appropriation of $100,000
from General Otis of the Los Angeles
Times. Before this sum is paid the citi
zens of the south may want to know all
the particulars concerning the disburse
ment of $100,000 appropriated by the last
Legislature for use by the Governor in
the betterment of the State's health. It
is roughly estimated that the Gage push
in T-iOs Angeles numbers one hundred and
therefore if the sum of $100,000 should be
equally divided among the Governor's
active political supporters in the south,
each of the push would receive $1000.

PUSH ADORNS
A PAYROLL
J. K. Phillips placed in ; nomination
Francis Drake of Los Angeles for Lieu
tenant Governor. B.' A. Meyer second-
DRAKE IS NOMINATED.
The first and most important nomina
tion was that ffof Governor. Nathan E.
Flint of San Francisco, in a characteristic
speech, placed in nomination George W.
Monteith of San Francisco. T. H. Horlan
of Colusa seconded the nomination.
J. L. Riddel of Santa Rosa placed in
nomination W. P. Squire of San Jose.
John Hines of Santa Clara, in seconding
the nomination of Squire, said he was
doing something that gave him more
pleasure than anything he had done for
several years. ' "In seconding this nomi
nation, fellow delegates," said he, "I
bring you the assurance of a great vic
tory. If we nominate this grand Union
soldier we shall make no mistake."
J. K. Phillips next spoke of the great
work that G.W. Monteith had done for
the organization.
The nominations were then closed and
balloting . began. On the first ballot
Squire i was nominated. Monteith arose
before the vote was announced and moved
that the nomination be made unanimous.
It was i so : ordered.
Squire in a brief speech thanked the
delegates for the honor, conferred on him.
"If.it be God's will," he said, "that I be
elected Governor of this great State, I in
tend to earn a record for honesty, jus
tice and morality. I believe in the saying,
Vox Populi, Vox Dei."
BALLOTING FOB GOVERNOR.
When the convention met in the after
noon the work of nominating the State
ticket went along quickly and smoothly.
The speeches were short and to the point
and most of the nominations were made
by acclamation.
Charles E. Lloyd of Alameda County
next spoke in I favor of deferring the
nominations, and suggested an adjourn
ment until the Fourth of July, when he
felt sure they could have two or three
hundred delegates present if the conven
tion was held in San Francisco, Oakland
or San Jose.
It looked at this point as if those op
posed to the immediate nomination of the
ticket would win, but Johnson of Sonoma
moved that the motion be laid on the
table. The second motion was seconded
by W. P. Squire of San Jose and it was
carried..
Before the close of the morning session
the name of Dr. G. C. Adams, pastor of
the First Congregational. Church, was
added to the roll of delegates.
LLOYD DESIRES TO "WAIT.
J. L. | Riddel of Santa Clara believed in
going slow, while Thomas Johnson of So
noma said he felt that if they postponed
the nominations they would never be able
to get such a number of delegates to
gether again. . .
George W. Monteith opposed the motion
and said that the delegates had got the
whole situation in their hands now and
if they hesitated they were lost.
John Aubrey Jones was in favor of tem
porarily deferring fhe nominations. T.
H. Horlan of Colusa thought the adjourn
ment of the meeting would be a "great
mistake. He opposed it and said he hoped
the gentlemen of the ! convention would
vote against Hines' motion. They had
been called from long distances, he said,
for the very purpose of making nomina
tions, and he demanded that they go
ahead and name a ticket.
John Hines of San Jose claimed the
floor and said that he considered the con
vention had arrived at the most impor
tant part of its work, and he felt that it
was unprepared to nominate candidates.
He urged great caution and deliberation
and moved that an adjournment be taken,
subject to the call of the State Central
Committee. â¢
HINES COUNSELS CAUTION.
J. George Smith, who during the session
Tuesday tried to force a substitute for
the first section of the report of the com
mittee on platform and resolution, at
tempted to address the meeting. He was
asked whether he was an affiliated so
cialist, and was told that if he was his
name would be stricken from the roll of
delegates. Smith replied that he desired
his name stricken from the roll, and he
was quickly accommodated.
Nominations for Governor were then de
clared in order.
Thomas Johnson of Sonoma offered a
resolution providing for a tree State mar
ket for. the farmers, /Which was carried
without much debate. .

ALLEGES CHECK
WAS WORTHLESS
Colonel Andrews Will
Swear to Complaint
Against Block.
Prisoner Makes Application
lor a Writ of Habeas
Corpus.
J. Block, who is believed by the police
to be the head of a gang that has been
victimizing hotel-keepers and banks
throughout the Southern and Middle
Western States and who attempted to
ewindle the Western National Eank of
this city by means of forged drafts, is
anxious to regain his liberty. Yesterday
Attorney Archie Campbell secured a writ
of habeas corpus for Block's release,
which writ was made returnable this
morning before Judge Lawlor. It will be
of no avuil, however, as Colonel A. An
drews of the Diamond Palace is ready to
swear to a warant for Block's arrest on
a charge of making and passing a ficti
tious check. On June 11 Block visited
Colonel Andrews' store and purchased a
pair of diamond sleeve buttons for $29,
giving him a check for the amount on
the Citizens' Bank of Santa Clara. Thy
check was written out by Block in
Colonel Andrews' presence and signed G.
A. Groves. It was sent to tne bank for
collection and returned dishonored.
Colonel Andrews was at the Hall of
Justice yesterday afternoon to swear, to
the complaint, but no Judge could be
found, and he promised the District At
torney that he would be at the Hall at
10 o'clock, sharp, this morning, so that
the complaint could be sworn to and
Block booked on the charge before the
argument on the writ could be heard by
Judge Lawlor.
The fact that he passed the fictitious
check on Colonel Andrews leads the po
lice to believe that Block's story to
the effect that the drafts he lodged with
the Western National Bank were given
him by another man and that he believed
them to be genuine is not true. They
also believe that he is the John O. Stone
who is wanted for numerous frauds
against hotel-keepers referred to in the
telegram to Captain of Detectives Mar
tin from the National Hotel-keepers' As-
Fcciation of New York. Groves is one of
the names on some of the drafts on
banks in Indianapolis. Cleveland, New
York and other cities found in zhe pris
oner's possession when searched at the
City Prison.
SUFFERS HANY WOUNDS

Want Conventions Held Here.
The Chamber of Commerce yesterday
Bent its well wishes to the American Li
brary Association Convention in Magno
lia, Mass.. and to the National Plumbers'
Association Convention at Atlantic City,
K. J., requesting in both cases that Sa"n
Francisco be selected as the place In
Tvbicn to hold their next annual gather

Private Suir Said to Be Insane.
George Suir, a private In the Seventh
Infantry, who was arrested Tuesday for
trying to pass a raised draft of the First
National Bank of Portland on a money
broker on Kearny street, was taken to
the Presidio yesterday. The police were
notified that Suir had been acting
strangely of late and it was believed that
his mind was unbalanced. He will be
dealt with by the military authorities.

The Â¦will of Dr. George W. Woods, med
ical director, U. S. N., who died on the
Sth inst., was filed for probate yesterday.
He leaves his entire estate, with the ex
ception of a few mementos, to his daugh
ter, Florence Baldwin Woods. The estate
exceeds $23,000 in value, and consists of
life insurance policies, land in Hope Val
ley and Excelsior Homestead and stock
in several corporations. The will is holo
graphic, bearing date of August 24, 1301.
The document was executed on board the

Inspector Williams and his son will
leave immediately for the East. During
their stay in the city they are guests of
the local Police Department. Chief Witt
man has detailed Detective Ed Gibson to
shew them over ihe city.
Inspector Williams is deemed one of
the best police officers in the country.
As captain of police he was in charge of
the tenderloin district and made a good
yecord. The word â¢tenderloin" was
coined by Williams. He had been Â¦ in
charge of an outside district, and was
transferred to that portion of New York
Â¦where the gilded youth is usually found.
3n an interview with a newspaper man
Captain Williams said: "I have been
thriving on rumpsteaks for the last few
years, and now will have some tender
loin." The scribe tbe following morning
announced that "Captain Williams had
been transferred to the tenderloin." The
Â¦word "tenderloin" has ever since been
applied to that part of a city where the
last set holds forth.
The officer was greeted by his father,
Inspector Williams of the New York Po
lice Department. The latter came from
iCew York to take charge of his invalid
boy, and was gratilied to find him able
to move. He came out here expecting to
lind his son in the hospital.

The freighter Leelanaw arrived yesterday,
15 days 1 hour from Panama, with 1670 tons of
New York cargo and eight steerage passengers.
This \ r oyage is the last the Leelanaw will make
under her charter to the Panama Railroad Com
pany. After discharging her cargo, which she
will do at Lombard-street wharf, it is expected
that Ehe will be sent back to the Eastern coast.
Freighter Leelanaw Arrives.
The champions of the new form of charter
party have given up their fight, and fcr this
year at any- rate the old form will continue
in vogue. The opposition of the ship-owners
proved too strong for the proposed change and
further attempts to make it go will be. aban

The Acapulco did not take a very large cargo.
In addition to thirty-nine Chinese she carried
passengers as follows:
The Pacific Mall Company's Acapulco sailed
yesterday for Panama and way ports with the
first New York freight the steamship company
has handled since its split with the Panama
Railroad Conjpany. The Acapulco inaugurates
the i joint service that was decided upon when
the corporations signed their recent peace
treaty. Shippers and consignees are pleased at
the resumption of the oVd state of affairs. The
Panama Railroad Company did not make a
success of its ocean transportation. The Argyll
and Leelanaw were not suitable on account of
their great depth of hold for the kind of cargo
they were called upon to handle, and the freight
suffered. For days after the Argyll or Lee
lanaw had discharged at Howard-street wharf
No. 3 the bulkhead outride of that dock was
covered with pools of ell that had oozed out or
the roughly handled barrels, and quite a stretch
of the wharf was impassable for pedestrians.
The people whose business takes them to that
part of the water front rejoice with shippers
and consignees at the peace that allows the
Mail Company to onqe more handle the ,f reight
business of the Panama Railroad.

The Mexican married Johnson's mother.
Johnson often wondered whence came his
father's income, but never gained definite
knowledge of the truth until the old man
was taken sick for the last time. Then
Johnson was called to the bedside and
told of the hidden plunder. He was also
given the map made by the old pirate,
with detailed directions as to the loca
tion of the gold. The map proved to be a
crude affair and the directions meager.
Neither Johnson nor Silverhorn will say
whether they have found the treasure,
but they now admit that they visited
Chriss Island to search for it.
As the story goes Johnson's stepfather
was given a map some time ago by an
old Mexican who was on his deathbed.
This Mexican claimed that his father in
the early days belonged to a band ,of
pirates who plied their nefarious vocation
along the California coast, with bountiful
results; that they used Chriss Island as a
place of rendezvous, as well as for the
hiding of their plunder. The old pirate,
when he was confined to his bed from a
bullet wound received while on a bucca
neering voyage, told his son where large
quantities of gold pieces had been buried
on the island. The son found the gold
and from time to time took as much as
he desired.
For the past two months J. E. Johnson
and Gus Silverhorn of Tomales have been
making frequent trips to Chriss Island,
which is not far from the mainland.
Some residents more curious than others
followed the two men on one occasion and
ultimately learned their secret.
SAN RAFAEL. June 18.â Tomales is ex
cited over the report that pirate treasure
is buried on Chrlss Island, near that place.
Two men have been excavating and trying
to find the cached strongbox of an early
California pirate crew for the past several
weeks, and rumor has it that they have
definite information as to Its approximate
location.

H. J. Thomas, a'delegate from the union

were reticent on the subject, and both
refuse to discuss the matter. It is
known, â¢ however, that the demands of
the men lor. an increase of wages and
reduction of hours are insigniiicant and
do not figure materially in the causes for
the strike.

Charles H. . Lovell, who will prooably
have charge of the estate of Tubbs, said
to-night: "Mr. Tubbs' will is to be ti.ln.1
in Alameda County. Oakland having been
the placo of his legal residerc?. I am
not t.L liberty to say anythhig about the
c ! c cument. Mrs. Tubba will not be able
to r.ttend he* husband's fu'ioral to-mor
row because of her injuries. I received
that vord frrn rer."
What fortune is left by Tubbs is not
definitely known. It is believed to be in
the neighborhood of a quarter of a mil
lion dollars.- The bulk of the estate went
to him as his share of the late Hiram
Tubbs' fortune. His father provided
liberally for his children, besides leaving
a large estate to his wife. The young
man had been successful in business af
fairs and had made excellent investments
during the past five years.
Felton Taylor and Charles H. Lovell
who were the . witnesses to Tubbs* mar
riage by Superior- Judge Wells at Mar
tinez, have concluded not to say a word
about the affair. Taylor, like Lovell, was
one of Tubbs 1 intimate friends, and was
selected for that reason as one of the
party which made the matrimonial trip
to the Contra Costa County seat.
Young Tubbs was devoted to his mother
and she returned the affection twofold. It
was in a large measure due to a fear that
she would object to the marriage that
Tubbs compelled those who knew of his
marriage to keep It a secret. His wife
knows the situation thoroughly and her
attitude concerning the funeral is much
appreciated by the members of her hus
band's family.
FRIENDS ARE RETICENT.
I advised her not to go to the funeral simply
because the strain would be very severe upon
her under the present state of her health. But
if she decides to attend the doors of the Tubbs
home will be open to her.
The family makes no objection to the at
tendance of Mrs. Tubbs. . I much doubt that
fhe will be there, because she is in no condi
tion to leave her room. In a conversation yes
terday with Mrs. Tubbs. after the fact of /her
marriage had been disclosed, she displayed a
delicacy of feeling which very greatly im
pressed us. She said to me: "I do not know
whether I shall be able to attend the funeral,
but if I should, perhaps my presence there
would make it very much harder for his moth
er, and maybe I ought to stay away, even at
the additional suffering it may entail upon me."
Herman Tubbs' will is in the possession
of his attorney and i intimate friend,
Charles H. Lovell, who drew the docu
ment. Lovell says the testament will be
read after the funeral and until that time
he will give no information concerning
its provisions, except to say that his client
and friend made ample provision for Mrs.
Tubbs. It is understood that Tubbs has
confirmed In, his. will a gift of the Sausa
lito villa he erected and presented to his
wife some time before his death. Further,
Mrs.- Tubbs is provided with ample income
to "keep up the establishment at Sausalito,
where she . and her husband had made
their home. . , . Â¦ . :
MAY NOT ATTEND FUNERAL..
Whether the widow will be in attend
ance at her husband's funeral fronv ttfe
Tubbs -home in East - Oakland to-morrow
afternoon is a matter resting solely with
herself.. Since -the accident in which
young Tubbs lost his life Mrs. Tubbs has
been confined to her bed under a surgeon's
care, with a trained nurse with her con
stantly. Her physical condition may pre
vent her from attending the services.
There Is no objection, now that the fam
ily has been assured of the marriage, to
the presence of Mrs. , Tubbs at the fun
eral. Upon that subject E. M. Hall Jr.,
who has charge of the funeral arrange
ments, said: :
The above statement. - made to-day by
E. M. Hall Jr., a brother-in-law of the
late Oakland capitalist, whose death re
vealed the secret of his marriage last
January at Martinez to Mrs. Alice Jef
freys, formerly Miss Meader of Oakland.
The declaration is sustained by other
members of the. Tubbs family. It ef
fectively disposes of idle rumor and gos
sip, aroused by. the. discovery that\.Her
man Tubbs leaves a wife to mourn hi3
sudden death at Sausalito on Monday
"There .will be no obstacle placed in the
way of the disposition of Herman Tubbs'
estate according to the provisions of his
will, so far as_the members of his family
are concerned^On .the. contrary, ! as soon
as the document is read, we shall be ready
to lend our "assistance to the widow in
arranging her affairs."

SACRAMENTO, June lS.-^-It Is probable
that the head officials of the United
States Land Offlce at Washington will
cause an investigation to be made of the
charges brought by the Bee on Monday
of this week, and repeated with particu
lars last night and to-night, against the
manner In which applications have been
made for several thousand acres of valu
able Government land in this State. 'The
paper has asked the department at
Washington not to proceed with the per
fection of the applications until the
fraudulent manner in which they were
obtained has become the subject of thor
ough investigation.
Owen McCabe, one of the claimants re
ferred to, admitted this afternoon that
he had been paid $4 by an employment
agent named Summerfield for his ser
vices. Charle3 Hill declares he was en
gaged by H. M. Van Annan of Oakland
to engage a number of claimanta at 13
each and that he. and Summerfield sent
up sixteen of them last week; that they
eftcacted from, them a fee of $1 each in
one of the rooms of the Governmtnt land

paid for his trouble by Van Arman.

RAILROAD MEN
AGREE TO STRIKE
Mrs. -McLure was the divorced wife of
L. E. Overhouse at the time of her mar
riage to McLure, which occurred about six
years ago. There are no children. Mrs.
McLure is a member of a prominent
Western Tolo family.
Confirmation was not lacking that the
two had planned to go together. The East
is now said to be their destination.
McLure has been engaged . recently in
harvesting on a neighboring farm. Last
evening he returned home to find his wife
missing. An investigation followed, and
soon it became known that Duncan had
left Capay on the afternoon train; that
Mrs. McLure had bought a ticket. for San
Francisco for the same train.
Â¦ I McLure did not pay the entire purchase
price at the time' of the sale; but a few
days ago pafd the balance, and Duncan is
known to have had several thousand dol
lars in his possession at the time of his
disappearance from his accustomed
haunts.
Duncan's home had been in Western
Yolo, where his father had accumulated
considerable property, and thither he
went after leaving his wife. On October
23, 1901, a little more than a week after
his r marriage, he sold his patrimony, a
farm, to B. E. McLure and took up his
residence with the purchaser and his
wife. : â¢-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦- . â¢ - -.-.,
On October 14, 1901, Miss Vernie Knight,
a student in the Woodland Business Col
lege, accompanied Walter G. Duncan to
Sacramento and on that day the two were
married. This was Duncan's second mat
rimonial venture. Mrs. Sarah Knight,
mother of the bride, was said to have
disapproved of her daughter's marriage at
so early an age, and the affair was usu
ally spoken of as an elopement.
The young couple returned to Cachc
ville,: the home of the bride's mother,
after a short honeymoon spent in San
Francisco. Duncan departed on the nexz
train, the leport ' goes, and the couple
have since lived apart.
WOODLAND, June 18.â A woman who,
up to yesterday, had been living In appar
ent content with her husband, and a man
who deserted his young wife almost at
the altar, are named as principals in a
scandal at Capay. Walter G. Duncan is
the man Involved; Mrs. B. E. McLure the
woman.

After the entertainment the flqpr was
cleared as quickly as possible and at 11:30
o'clock dancing was begun. The ball
lasted until the early hours this morning.
For the second part of the programme
there were specialties from the Orpheum
circuit and a new change was rung in on
the Florodora racket. - ;

evoked much applause with his solo, "Be

The worthy president, Charles G.
Nagle, made the first hit of the evening
when he asked the ladies to take their
hats off. A little later he failed to score
when he tried to get "the boys" to stand
up and sing a jingle about the proposed
Eagles' Fourth of July excursion to
Napa, for few stood up and fewer sang.
But he made good later by a speech about
the aerie, .the ball and the excursion.
The hall was decorated with bunting
and the stars and stripes. Two huge
eagles in graceful poise rested at either
side of the stage, handsome emblems of
the order.
There was some standing room left over
at the minstrel entertainment and ball

last night, but no seats were unoccupied,

After the address the audience crowded

Mayor Sehmitz said that he did not be

"Bring the employer and the employe

Mayor Sehmitz spoke briefly and sim

J wish to FtatÂ«- that tlie teaching of modern

hipli s- lir-ols, is not pl\en t_* attention that
the j in ports n<:e demands. The study of these
language for B period of two years in the
high BL'twula is not adequate.
It "is my judgment that the larger grammar
Khoota should not nnly be provided with a
rice prinr-ipal but that one of the teachers
be desigrnatp-i as a yard assistant to
take cliai-fte of tlie girls' yard rvith extra com
pensation. In fa^t it would be well in all
Â¦cbooU having pight or more classes to desig
nate such an assistant. This would result in
ut:tferm and improved yard discipline. At the
large grammar hchools it is impossible for a
principal to have charge of a yard at inter-
E-.isMons and lipfore school and to attend to
the many demands? that are made upon his
liircc and attention by pupils and visitors.
Tho Superintendent says provision
should be made for an additional class at
the MÂ«-nroe School for the coming year,
ai)<5 continues:
That a new building be provided for the

That the Laguna Honda School be provided
with at least two additional class-rooms, to be

Education. I am informed, to provide the cit
izens of the Sunset District (Laguna Honda
School) with an eight or twelve class-room
liuilding ia the event the Supervisors make
the special levy for building school houses.
2 1 is to be earnestly hoped that the gentlemen
at the board will be able to consummate this
improvement.
That when the board can afford to do so, a
new building be provided for the accommoda

Superintendent Webster filed his mopth
ly report on school Inspection during the
last month, in which he states that he
does not find insinuated incompetency in
the department justified. Webster makes
tne following recommendations:
fourth. That as far as practicable there be
but on? grade assigned to a teacher and that
its instruction in two divisions be optional.
A teacher's time is so fully occupied in con
ducting recitations in two divisions that in
dividual instruction and assistance is rendered
well nigh impossible; thus one of the most
important factors in the advancement of slow
er pupi!s is eliminated. Again, children can
not concentrate their thoughts upon their
studies while others are reciting. The etudy
period should be one in which general quiet
prevails, during which time the teacher can
render individual assistance.
Fifth, That promotion be annual.
Sixth. That report cards be issued monthly
to delinquents; otherwise, quarterly.
Superintendent Webster submitted to
life Board of Education yesterday a list
of amendments to the limitations in the
schedule of work set forth in the present
course cf study Icr the elementary public
schools. The modifications are in accord
ance with the urgent petition of teachers
ms.Ce In ihe grade meetings held during
the last term. Webster recommends that
work in spelling be diminished and made
definite and that the lists of words select
eo be printed, grade for grade, for the use
of rupUs- Webster also suggests that the
course of study be rewritten and makes
the following" recommendations, which
ucre taken under advisement by the
board:
First That in accordance with law pro
viding "that if subjects of study not epcclned
by statute to tjs taught are required by a
Uumi of Education, they must be studied in
i'eu ci statutory btudies, nature study and
ubj-fciologv be omitted for manual training,
and tar the s=rune reason that work in draw
ing be decreased or correlated with manual
training Owing to the time consumed in go
i-_ to and returning from the manual train
ir* laboratories ana to their .limited accom
modations, in some cases as much as three
hours per week is being expended on the sulÂ»
jecf it is recommended that arrangements
be made so that all boys of a class may be
cent to a laboratory at the same hour and
further that when the boys are at manual
training lessons the Â£irls may be receiving
instruction in cooking.
JSecoud That the course of study In drawing
be din.iniElied in its exactions by the Super
visor of that subject.
Third. That the subject of sewing be dis
continued.
ONE GEADE TO A TEACHER.
A new build! nz of twelve classes to take
the place of the present small school and tc
accommodate the overflow classes, to be lo
cated on the present site of the Monroe School.
The estimated cost of building Is $35,000.
Total cost of buildings, $319,000.
A new school to take the place of the
present Sheridan School at Ocean View
is also greatly needed. A playground for
the Xorth Beach district Is also required.
Superintendent Webster indorsed the
recommendations of the Directors, with
the suggestion that the Washington
School be the first to be built and the
Spring Valley School the next. Webster
thought the McKinley School might be
dispensed with, but the Directors dis
agreed with him. v
Supervisor Alpers objected to building
a schoolhouse on the site selected by the
Beard of Education in the Sunnyside dis
trict. Alpers claimed that the site is not
centrally located and is unsanitary be
cause there is no sewer in the locality.
He objected to the board paying $5300 for
the lot when the price first asked was
only $3500.
The committee finally agreed to report
in favor of the recommendations made by
the Board of Education.-
A new modern brick building of sixteen
classes^ to be erected on the present site of
the Washington Grammar School, to be called
the Washington Grammar School. Additional
land win be needed for children's playground.
The estimated cost of building and land Is
195.000.
President Dcnman then submitted a list
of eight new schoolhouses decided on by
his board as the most urgently needed.
They are as follows:
A new school of twelve rooms to be called
the Noe Valley School, to be erected on a lot
belonging to the city and county at the corner
of Twenty-fourth and Douglass streets. The
estimated cost of building, with grading, etc.,
is K4U,CCu. <
A new school of twelve classes to be called
the McKinley School, to relieve the overflow
class.es of the Hearst, Everett, Douglass and
Crocker schools. The estimated cost of the lot
is $20,000 and cost of building $35,000. .
A new school of eight classes in Sunnyside
district. The estimated cost of lot is $6000
aftd of the buildinjr .$24,000. â¢
A new school of eight classes in Richmond
District, to be erected on a school lot which is
the proi.erty of this city and county. The
estimated cost of building is $24,000. -
Four new rooms are most urgently needed
to relieve Dresent overcrowding at the Sher
man School. The building is to be raised and
four rooms built on the ground floor, to cost
!j>10,COO.
A new building of twelve classes, to "be lo
cated on the present site of the Lacuna Honda
School. The estimated cost of building is $30,
000.
Supervisor D'Ancona informed the Di
rectors that the. Board of Supervisors de
sired to know just how the money raised
by a special levy is to be spent. He re
quested that a general statement of the
schoolhouses proposed to be built be fur
nished.
The Supervisors' Committee on Educa
tion held a conference yesterday with the
School Directors relative to having the
schoolhouses designed to be built under

NEW YORK. June 18.â Leaders of the bull
campaign in etocks made a more Impressive
demonstration to-day than at any time since
the campaign began. The market broadened
and there was an Increase of activity, the vol
ume cf dealings rising over that for any other
clay 6ince tome time before the first of the
present month. The strength In the market
Â¦we* pretty Rpnorally disseminated through the
railroad list, but the industrial department,
as a whole, was a conspicuous exception to the
etrer.gth prevalent elsewhere. There was lit
tle newt to account for the rielng- tendency.
The bulk cf the operations wai attributed to
the Western speculative party, which was
credited yesterday with having secured a cor
ner on the July option in corn. The distress
of the ehorts In the corn market this morning
eccmed to give added effect to the demonstra
tion in the Etock market, but the sharp reac
tion later In corn did not alter materially # the
tone of the stock market. The news of the
day was rather adverse to the rise In stocks.
Tot instance, the calling of a national con
vention of coal miners In Indianapolis must

b. euEpencicn of work, among soft coal miners.
On what principle this news should induce an
active demand for Reading and also for the
eoft coal carriers Is not very clear. In fact.
realists* made it-?e!f effective in Reading and
wi;>cd out al! its gain. The report of too much

HOTEL ABSIVAL&
CHICAGO, June 18. â Corn executed a high
and lofty tumbling feat to-day. Nerve-racking
excitement over the corner In July options ruled
the day. From the opening of the pit the Wall
street clique shuffled prices in such an aston
ishing manner that the gyrations exhibited
made yesterday's erratic ups and downs
look like ' an ordinary "smoking room
day." Every natural condition Inherent to the
pits' was ignored. It was a. battle for millions
with crafty men on each side. To-day it suited
the big manipulator to a!16w | price's to jump
skyward for a time, and then it as oddly suited
them to push them down with remarkable
rapidity. The range of July corn â an'd that
was all that was of importance on 'Change to
day â consisted of an upturn of 1% cents at the
opening, a slump of 3%c from the top price and
a slight recovery from the bottom figures. Other
pits naturally felt the influence of such pranks,
but most speculators In other commodities did
not allqw their Judgment to be marred, and in
the end July corn closed 2 cents down, July
wheat %c higher and July oats %c lower. Pro
visions closed 5c to 7%c higher. . ' -
At the start corn shorts, fearful of a repeti
tion of yesterday's rocket-like advance, bid
wildly for corn to cover their accounts. ' The
big bulls came openly Into the pit and bid
against them. In a trice July, which closed
yesterday at 67%c, made simultaneous sales at
68c and 69c. This was too good a price for
longs to withstand. Men who had loaded up
with stuff around 62 cents or under let the
crowd have in plentiful lots. The Gates clique
tried to hide Its hand, but the crowd soon
learned that it was unloading large quantities
for profits. The little shorts were content to
get out of the market with losses, even on a
declining market. It seemed to be the Inten
tion ol the big bulls then to squeeze- out the
small bulls , who had . "tailed" after. In order
to do this, stuff was thrown on the market in
big lots. Several million bushels were unloaded
on the shorts at fancy prices and a considerable
amount of longr stuff that was sold near the
opening was taken by influential parties on
the slump. Pursuing such tactics, it took, the
bull contingent a comparatively short time to
push prices down 3%c from the top price, until
July sold at 65%e. Fluctuations of ordinary
magnitude were considered ridiculously small
to-day. All traders. were nervous and excited.
The pit had practically all the Interest on the.
board. At the close July was still congested,'
but comparatively weak. .2 cents under yester
day, at Â¦'65%c September waa strong early
until the July bulge, but sold off on general
liquidation. The story was going tho rounds
that September is to be given a whirl similar
to that now experienced by the nearer delivery.
At the close experienced traders did not know
what to think of the conditions. There has
been talk of 75-cent corn, but against this Is
arrayed the possibility of large contract grad
ing by private elevators. In three days 500,000
buchcls of .contract stuff has been .made.
'Weather reports were not good, and bad | news
of the crops was, coming. Receipts to-day were
219 cars, 21 of contract grade.
Wheat had a fairly active day, with a liberal
trade, but the feeling was nervous and tense in,
sympathy with the congested condition of the
corn pit. The advance In corn at the opening
had- something of a reflection , of the : advance
In wheat, and later the slump was accompanied
also by a following weakness In wheat. In the
end, however, natural conditions prevailed to
some extent. The impression gained ground
that weather conditions abroad have been. very
wet ; and cool and crops .as a result have suf -

Receipts of new Potatoes yesterday were the
largest- thus far this season and the market
continued, easy owing to -the abundance of
poor stock which was offering freely. As usual
a few lots of fancy stock commanded a pre

per lb. Garnet Chiles were a shade easier in
sympathy with the other varieties. Old pota
toes were unchanged and dull. . - ". *
Onions stood about the same, with supplies
more than sufficient. ...
Receipts of Tomatoes from Los Angeles an'l
Vacaville were large and the market was weak
at previously quoted prices. Those from Mis

Peas from across the bay offering at easy
.prices,-, and some of the Asparagus came, to

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
I Butter is lower, j There. Is too much on the
market for this time of the'year when so many
people are out of town, and dealers 1 are oiter-j
Ing it at' concessions right, and left. Receipts
continue liberal. Thd decline In creameries has
brought' them very close to dairies and the dif
ference between them is now very slight, as
will be seen.
; There is no change in Cheese. '
; Like Butter, the Egg market Is overstocked,
"and the demand, has fallen away to a fraction
of what it was some weeks ago, ; owing" to the
absence of so many consumers from the city.
The floors ' are : becoming crowded with the
goods, and dealers say that they will probably
have to resume storing In a day or so. They
aro offering fine ranch at 18%@19c,
finding buyers, and 20c now represents the top
price for. the .best Eggs in the market. There
are no j Eastern offering now, â¢ recent . arrivals

that in Central Illinois, which was lifted 7
points, with constantly increasing urgency as

The depression of Industrials to-day was in

GIL.ROY, June 18.â Peter Donnelly, who
represented the Gilroy district for two
terms in the Board of Supervisors, died
this morning. He was 67 years of age
and a native of Ireland. Mr. Donnelly
came to California in the early '50' s. Fqr
many years he was a milk dealer in San
Francisco and accumulated considerable
wealth. Removing to - this county, he
purchased 3000 . acres of land and en
gaged tn stockraisingand dairying. In 1884
he was elected Supervisor on the Demo
cratic ticket, and four years later was re
elected. A widow and a sister, Mrs. J.
Fosgate of Santa Clara, survive him.
Peter Donnelly.
Finally she told him that If he did not
cease paying court to Miss Silva she
would lock him out of her house. It waa
because he remained true to his sweet
heart that his arrest and the subsequent
tragedy occurred.
From the. facts brought to light since
the suicide, it appears that Borgensen,
who was just 19 years of age, had often
declared his intention of marrying Miss
Silva. His mother tried on various occa
sions to break off the match.
SAN RAFAEL, June 13.â The funeral of
Carl Borgensen, the young man who com
mitted suicide in the Mill Valley jail be
cause his mother had caused his arrest,
took place in this city to-day, the Coroner
having charge of the obsequies. Mrs.
Martha Borgensen, mother of the dead
youth, was present, as was also hl3
sweetheart. Miss Silva. The former's
lack of distress during the funeral cere
mony and the latter's intense grief di
vided the attention of the others who at
tended the funeral.
Mrs. Borgensen shed not a tear during
the services.

In conclusion the witness said that th.o
insurrection in Tayabas and Batangaa
provinces had been broken up as a result
of the methods adopted by General J.
Franklin Bell in conducting the campaign
there. " â¢ Â« â¢ - â¢-
He declared that he could have called,
100 riflemen and 400 bolomen in Tayaba3
province, and this without counting upon,
the men he could have raised in the other
provinces; that the people in the towns of
Tayabas obeyed the orders issued by the
American authorities as well as his own.
He sent supplies to the insurgents, he
said, and then after the lapse of a
few days would notify the Americans
that such supplies had gone out. This.
Malvar ordered the townspeople to do, in
order that they might not be suspected
by the Americans of disloyalty.
Major Cornelius Gardener called tl>Â©
former Insurgent General Malvajr, who
surrendered m Batangas province last
April, to testify to-day before the board
which is investigating . the charged
brought by Major Gardener concerning
conditions in Tayabua province, Luzon.
General Malyar said Tayabas had been,
one of the best disciplined insurgent
sirongholds under his control, and that
each municipality. in the-province has re
ceived him. ... : -. " ' .'Â¦
Colonel Baldwin says that the Sultana
of Biicolor and Masain will have to be
taken prisoners before permanent peace
in Mindanao is possible.
"We ask you to retire to Malabang;
we do not want you in the Lake Lanao
district unless you will join our religion
and adopt our customs. In case you do
not so desire all the -dattos will makt*
war on you, because here there is bat
one religion, that of Stamboul."
MANILA, June 18.â Colonel Frank D.
Baldwin of the Twenty-seventh infantry,
who is stationed on the island of Min
danao, sent a letter to the Sultan of
Bacolor in which he sets forth the in
tentions of the American authorities. Col
onel Baldwin said, among other thlÂ»gs,
that the Americans did not intend to- in
terfere with the religion, p lurality of
wives or property of the Moros. The fol
lowing, reply has been received from the
Sultan by Colonel Baldwin:
VIEW COSTLY PLANTS.
At the conclusion of the testing the
visitors were received at the Oakland
Gas, Light and Heat Company's plant by
Superintendent G. .C. Holberton. More â¢
than an hour was passed in inspecting the t
steam plant, arc alternating* machinery
and direct current. The next place of in
terest visited was the Piedmont power
house and the Oakland Transit Com
pany's plant. Superintendent Brown re
ceived the electricians and escorted them
over the house and some time was passed
in inspecting the machinery and electric
appliances. â¢' . -I
The aggregate value of the plants in
spected by the electricians amounts to
almost half a million of dollars.
Mr. Farrar said during the inspection
that San Francisco and Oakland were far
ahead of his State, Michigan, in the mat
ter of electric plants. He not only ex
pressed his great surprise at the admir
able order of everything he saw in Oak
land's electric power-houses, but was
astonished to find the most modern plant
in each of >the establishments visited.

harder test, for it was not disturbed un
til 1O0.0OO volts hissed and cracked like
volleys from musketry and succeeded in
making a puncture. The third insulator
tested stood the terrific strain of 127,000
volts without being punctured.
The fourth test was made to show, a
breaking down of the atmosphere between
two needle points separated twelve and a
half inches. The air broke down and the
arc jumped across the space at 120,000
volts. 'â¢Â¦.'.- Â¦-. â¢ . ' :
These demonstrations were watched
with the keenest' attention, the elec

many words of warning.
GREAT ELECTRICAL TESTS.

high tension line insulators. /Three in
sulators were set up on the testing rack
with the object of demonstrating the
methods adopted by the company of test

127,000. Â¦
The first place of interest visited by the
electricians was ,. the sub-station of the
Standard Electric Company^ Oakland,
where II. C. Friday, the superintendent
of the station, was in waiting to receive
the guests.

. . FUNERAL REFORM BOYCOTT.
The undertakers of San Francisco are un-
friendly .to cremation because the expense is
very much less than that of "interment.- They
know that if cremation, sets . the pace In. fu-
neral reform reduced prices must be- met, or
graveyards closed. They control over five
hundred hacks, the drivers of which belong
to the Hackmen's Union, Local No. 224. That
union (through misrepresentation made to
them)' has resolved not to drive for us at our
funerals or rent hacks to attend them.- '
We think the friends of cremation will. If
necessary, dispense with a string of hacks
and the services of the undertakers rather
than see Incineration obstructed by a cause-
less, heartless boycott of the dead.
We own two first-class carriages and- at-
tractive hearses ; and horses, which we will
furnish upon application. For further In-
formation, call at No. 429 Golden Gate ave.

I agree with Mr. Binney. that the freight rate
on California fruits, especially citrus fruits. Is
too high. I have said Â¦ so repeatedly to Air.
Rlpley and to the Southern Pacific and other
railroad .officials. I believe that a rate of $1
per hundred pounds instead ot $1 25 would ba
fair and reasonable under present conditions.
As to the lemon Industry, a great deal would
liave to be said in detail in order to pive any
sufficient and conclusive data on the subject.
This. 1 think, however, all will agree upon,
that' from December to June there is practlc-'
ally no profit In lemon growing in Ciillfornit.
From December to May, when the fruit can be
held In curing houses, there Is good profit to
the growers, provided, ot course, that the fruit
has good keeping Â¦qualities. There Is no ques
tion that the California lemons" are superior to
the Sicilies and will displace them In the mar
kets whenever they are put against them. This
is no matter of theory or State pride, but a
simple matter of fact that the trade â¢ all over
the United States will testify to. I do not con
sider that intemperate statements such as Mr.
Binney has made are apt to benefit thÂ« cause,
but rather the contrary.
Two commercial bodies in California are
concerning themselves about the Califor
nia lemon. These are the State Board of
Trade and the Southern California Fruit
Exchange. Not long ago F. A- Binney
of Helix, this State, made some state
ments In Chicago about freight rates on
lemons from this State to the East, and
incidentally remarked that the lemon
growers, by reason of such rates, were
not in the way to make money. The-
State Board of Trade took up the matter
ai once and instructed Manager Filcher
to.vwrlte to Manager Naftzger of the
Southern California Fruit Exchange and
find' out the facts, for. while the people
cf the- State are endeavoring to get de
sirable parties to locate in California,
talk calculated to persuade the Eastern
man that California is not a place to
make profit in the lemon line or in any
other productive- industry might do harm
unless the truth in the premises could be
shown.' .
Manager Naftzger of the Southern Cali
fornia Fruit Exchange has replied to the
communication of inquiry from the State
Board of Trade. He writes that he would
not accept Mr. Binney as an authority on
lemons in California, and incidentally
classes some of his remarks under^the
â¢general explosive - title ot â¢â¢volcanic."
Then ho discusses the lemon and Us fu
ture. In part he writes as follows:

which were dispatched without delay, and
the picnickers landed at Fernbrook Park
about 11 o'clock. An elaborate pro
gramme had been arranged, but the first
order of business was luncheon. Here" the
members of the feminine sex showed their
great skill. Dainty viands were spread
under the oak . trees and everybody
feasted.
After luncheon the military band, that
had been specially engaged for the occa
sion, started a waltz, which- brought all
those who cared to dance to the pavilion.
Athletic games were also in order. D.
Sheerin, with his coat off and a good
blackthorn stick in his hand, acted as
starter. There were all kinds of races,
the altar boys, the girls and boys of the
church and even the fat ladies running
for prizes.
About 3 o'clock the committee in charge
of the picnic hung up the lucky numbers
that had won gate prizes. Tommy
Kearns. the well-known actor, who Is ou$
here for his summer vacation, won a sack
of flour and D. R. McNeil of launch fame
won two tickets to a local theater.
There were many who helped ttx make
the picnic a success. The Very Rev. Pius
Murphy and many other fathers of the
Dominican Order went around and saw
that erery one had a good time. Dan
Leary took a day off from the City Hall
and assumed charge of the Irish jig plat
form. When others could not be found
to take a step he would lead off with "The
Rocky Road to Dublin" himself.
. The committees were as follows:

To Regulate Lodging-Houses.
The Health Board met yesterday . and
on the recommendation of Chief Sanitary
Inspector Hassler decided to draft an or
dinance for presentation to the Board of
Supervisors regulating cheap lodging
houses and, requiring? them to be kept
above ground and.in a sanitary condition.
The board decided to ask the Supervisors
to appropriate 51500 for a new sterilizer
in the City and County Hospital. Jacqb
Wiesner was appointed ambulance driver
and T. J. Fulton watchman at the City

After the transaction of routine business
the board adjourned to meet next Wednes
day. .
The condition of the State's property
near the North Pacific Coast Railroad's
frontage on Sansome street was discussed
by Manager Renner of the Draymen's
(Association. He said the street was in
need of repair and that the Board of Pub
lic "Works would pave the street if the
Harbor Commissioners laid a sidewalk on
Â¦their property. Renner said the improve
.ment w r as an absolute necessity and that
the draymen of the city were clamoring
for It.. The Commissioners referred the
matter to the engineer for an estimate of
the cost, the intention being that the Im
provement would be ordered.
A â¢ member of th'e Fourth of July com
mittee, appointed by, the Mayor, ap
peared before the board and asked that
the electric lamps placed upon the ferry
tower be retained there until after the
national celebration and that they be
Illuminated at the expense of the State* on
the. evenings of July 3, 4 and^5.- It was
announced that there would be a general
illumination of the- city on the dates
named and that it was desired to have the
ferry building present an attractive ap
pearance. The board- granted the request
and orders were given for the illumina
tion of the building on the evenings
stated.
At a former meeting of the board Nor
ton admitted that he had made the
changes without authority, but said they
were in -the of the State. He
was ordered to show/wherein the State
was " benefited, but at yesterday's meet
ing he said that Contractor Wakefleld
being absent in the north, he was unable
to file the desired report. The matter then
went - over pending the arrival of "Wake

Engineer Lott D. Norton failed to pre
sent his report upon the cost of the
changes . made in. the specifications for
harbor "/work, as ordered by him, at the
meeting of the Harbor Commission yes
terday. Following the expose by The
Call of the illegal changes in the specifica
tions, the board directed that a searching
inquiry be held and that Norton file an
estimate of the cost of such changes, to

by them. ' Â¦ .

OTHER ITEMS VETOED.
The following other Items were vetoed
Dy the Mayo?:
The Mayor also vetoed the item of J2L
06O appropriated out of the surplus or
increased assessment roll for one addi
tional police captain, four additional lieu
tenants ar.d ten additional patrolmen.
In vetoing this item, the Mayor stated
that he considered the additions to the de
partment as allowed In the regular ap
propriation fully sufficient for the next
fiscal year.
The amount set aside for the lighting of
the streets and public buildings was de
creased from $275,000 to $260,000, which was
the amount originally recommended by
the finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors. The Mayor stated that the
Charter prohibits the city from entering
into a contract to pay a higher price for
g-as or electricity than the minimum
price charged to any other consumer. In
conclusion,, in regard to money for Il
lumination, he said that the expenses for
the present year would aggregate about
$256,000 and tbat he believed that $260 000
would be sufficient to provide an efficient
service.

SLASHES WOBES' BOARD ROIX.
Of the $31,000 taken from the Health De
partment. $20a60 had been set aside by the
Supervisors lor the payment of salaries
in the central office. The Mayor cut $600
from the $3500 allowed for the Health Of-
Jicer's salary, and he recommended that
â¢that official be required to devote all his
xime to his office usui that he abstain
from private practice during office hours.
Of the 533.600 provided for emergency and
insane hospitals, $4020 was knocked out,
and $S50i> of the item of $67,000 allowed for
the expenses of the City and County Hos
pital was also cut out.
The Board of Public "Works suffered al
most as heavily as did the Health Depart
ment, as S:2tÂ«. joÂ»). was stricken from its al
lotment. .Most of this sum is cut from
the amount provided for salaries. Many
clerks of the board who were figuring on
2 raise and many others who are not
clerks, but who expecJ ed to serve the city
in that capacity, will be grievouslv disap
pointed. Xha Mayor vetoed $1SW of the
S.)S.-J?5 set aside to be uped in cleaning and
maintaining The City Hall and the Hall of
Justice. Thl* amount is approximately
the salaries of two janitors, as the Mayor
believes that thirty-two janitors can do
the work of the thirty-four provided for
Of the appropriation of $17,700 for the
salaries of the employes of the Bureau of
Streets, the Mayor knocked off 55700, the
salaries of four clerks.
The Board of Supervisors allowed the
Board of Public "VVorks $60,006 for the Bu
reau of Engineering, exclusive of thÂ«
35000 allowed for the examination of pub
lic utilities. The Mayor vetoed J10.000 of
this amount, and for so doing gives the
loilowiue reason:
This bureau employed during the current fis
cal year tome thirty-eight men. It asked for
the next fiscal year for fifty-eight. I am sat
isfied en looking over the list of employes and
their ealarSep that no public Interest will suf
fer in any appreciable degree by a "lump" re
duction of the amount indicated. The busi
ness of this bureau can. I am sure, be so ar
rsnt-ed xvith regard both to economy and to
practical utility that all its legitimate expenses,
outside of the examination into public utilities
can be embraced in the sum of $50.C00.
The important appropriations for the School
Department, the Fire Department. thÂ« Depart
ment of Electricity, the I\>Hee Department, the
Ahnshouse and the Free Public Library also
remain intact.
In conclusion I resT>ecifully call the attention
of your Tionorabte fcosrd to the fact that no
appropriation for permanent improvements or
for municipal betterments has been by this
message In anywise inlerffered with, my object
having bern so jar as possible^ in the light of
my information, to ccrtail unnecessary posi
tions and salaries. Â¦
In conclusion the Mayor called the at
tention of the board to the class of Items
which had been vetoed by him, as follows:
The money saved by the Mayor's veto
from being eruten up by salaries can now
be used for public improvements, unless
the Board of Supervisors overrides the
veto. . . ' . . Â¦ A
Probably tie heaviest sufferer by reason
of the Mayor's veto is the Health Depart
ment, which Joses $31,000.
Mayor Schmitz flJed with the clerk of
the Eoard of Supervisors last night a list
of the items in the tax budget for the en
suing 'year which he has seen fit to veto
either j>artially or wholly. The llayor has
decreased the budget submitted to him
by thei Board of Supervisors to the extent
of J134ST00. In each instance the Mayor
has staisd "why he has vetoed the partic
ular item and his explanations make inter
esting: reading for the taxpayers. As a
sort of preface he states that it has long
been .apparent to him that too much
xncney is expended in salaries and far
too little in permanent municipal improve
ments. It Tva-s one of the chief complaints
against the budget as prepared by the Su
pervisors that scarcely any money at all
Â¦was set aside for public Improvement,
while .an immense sum was devoted to the
payment of 'salaries.
