Legislation will be proposed to you for the amendment of the law relat

disposal proves to be adequate It will be laid before you for the purpose of
regulating the voluntary sale by landlords to occupying tenants in Ireland;
for amending and consolidating the factory and workshops acts; for the bet
ter administration of the law respecting lunatics; for amending thÂ» public
health acts in regard to the water supply; for the prevention of drunkenness
in licensed houses and public places, and for amending the law of literary

Gentlemen of the House of Commons: The estimates for the year will be

naval and military requirements of the country, and especially the outlay con

King." the people uncovered, the state
coach rolled out of the archwav in the
center of the palace .and was greeted witn
a roar of cheering. The yeomen gentle
men of the guard,' with halberds, followed.
The Horse Guards took up positions In
frnr.t of and behind the state coach. Th-Â«
heroejt of the crowd were the members
of Strnthcona's Horso, who .are Just back
from South Africa and who came in sev

cheered them rr peatedly.
From Buckinsham Palace to' the House
of Lords the procession proceeded with
out a hitch at a walking pace. All along
the route hats and handkerchiefs were
waved and the greatest enthusiasm was
displayed. The approaches to the houses
cf Parliament were black with people,
who were kept in their places by Irish

leads to the House of Lords, were about
MO persons, chiefly women, who had been

thÂ«m were many peers and Commoners
who were unable to get places within Xha
chamber.
After some delay the robing-room doora

formed up, moved slowly ahead through
the dingy gallery. Xo funeral could have
been Quieter. The aristocratic spectators
were perfectly still. Slowly the heralds
marched -toward the upper chamber.

The Duke of Devonshire, president of the
Council. Immediately preceded him, car

with equal dignity, clasped the sword of
state. The King was half down to the
pallery before the women remembered to
courtesy, and then black skirts rustled
ceaselessly and noble heads were bowed.
Smiling genially, the King bowed right
and left. He never looked better. H!Â«
huge, ermine cape gave an enormous
breadth to his shoulders and set tÂ»*t the
healthy color of his face.

Mrs. Nation was not so tired but that
she could see all that was going on. and
she commanded some men to stop smok
ing, as she* emerged from the courtroom.
Mrs. Nation has not lost a bit of her pop
ularity since her visit to Chicago. She is
followed wherever she goes by the same
large crowds. People seem to have much
more respect for her than they had before
and she has no difficulty. whatever in go
ing about the streets. She says she ex
pects to be released as a result of her
trial next Monday.
Mrs. Nation, appeared to be utterly un
concerned throughout the trial. She leaned
over the table occasionally and talked in"
a cheery fashion with her accusers and
they answered in the utmost good nature.
She appeared to be relieved when the trial
was over, as she was very tired as a re
sult of her Chicago trip. This did not
prevent the people in the courtroom from
greeting her, however, and she held an
Impromptu reception for several minutes
after the adjournment of the case.
The line" of Mrs. Nation's defense Is that
she, as a* private citizen, had a right to
abate a nuisance after the officers had
failed to do so.
After a conference between the attor
neys it was agreed that Kelly should ad

Mrs. Nation should plead guilty to smash-

"Yeu will have to keep still."- said tha
court. "This trial will be conducted llko
any other, case and quiet must be main
tained. The Marshal will keep order. I
overrule the motion. Do you plead guilty
or not guilty?" .. >*
"Not guilty," said Mrs. Nation's attor
ney. v -v- 7-
Mike Kelly, one of the proprietors of
the Senate, was the first witness calletL
Kelly was made to say that he had been
arrested several times on the charge of
selling liquor. He claimed, however, that
the cash register smashed by Mrs. Nation
was kept to receive the receipts of the
poolroom and sales of soda water and
cigars.
At 2:15 Mrs. Nation entered the court
room and made her way through tha
crowd to her place at tho table by her
lawyer. The crowd applauded,- Mrs. Na
tion smiled and bowed, but said not a
word. .The crowd continued to applaud
and Judge McCabe demanded order and
called upon the Marshal to preserve quet.
Attorney Dumenit argued a motioa to

was not. properly drawn. Mr*. Nation""
could keep quiet no longer and rose to her
feet.
"Tour Honor." commenced Mrs. Na

"Quiet," ordered Judge McCabe.

continued Mrs. Nation.
Rev. F. "W. Emerson volunteered the In

posted announcing; the enforcement of

the disturbances. -Mounted , troop's pa
trolled the cfty: and occupied every
strategic point, and- a demonstration
toward the palace on actfount of the wed

disturbance of any kind occurred to-day.
Immense crowds surrounded the palace
during the ceremony, but not a word of
disrespect was overheard." After the
ceremony the Mayor Issued an appeal to"
the populace, asking for calmness.
General " Weyler has issued a proclama

the present. .Madrid is quiet to-night:";
, Shortly after. 10 Â©â¢clock this morning the
guests began to arrive at the palace,
mounting the grand staircase and travers
ing the long corridors, lined" on each side
by 'halbiders, in red coats,, white trousers
and black leggings, to the entrance of 'the
chapel, where the Palace Guards, by
thoroughly perfected plans, escorted each
person, to a proper seat. Every'arrange
ment w*as accurately made. â¢ There was
no crowding or Jostling. The diplomatic
tribune was first filled. Among the early
comers, were Bellamy Storer. United
States Minister, and Mrs. Storer.
When the, chapel finally filled a scene
of wondrous coloring, due to the bril
liancy of the dresses of the court, ladles
r.nd the elegant uniforms of officers and
diplomats, was displayed. Just as .the
cathedral clock chimed 11 the strains' of
tho "Broscle March" pealed from the
organ while the bridegroom's party en
tered and took seats . before .the altar,
between the tribunes on each side. Prince
Oharles wore the simple uniform of a
captain of artillery, but displayed also
the Order of the Golden Fleece. The
Duke of Callbra wore a similar uniform
covered with Spanish and Italian deco
rations. Prince Gennaro was in the uni
form of a cadet and the Count of Caserta
in ordinarV evening dress.
/The Countess; wore a cream-colored
court gown and her three daughters'
dresses were relieved with head and neck
wear, of white lace.
. After a moment's waiting the more Im
posing cortege of the bride arrived. It
was preceded by all the court officials,
who advanced amid an imposing sound
cf , trumpets. ' King Alfonso, .dressed i;i
. the simple uniform of.a, cadet, with a
email sword at his side; -led the way. He
walked erect- and 'firmly, his healthy ap
pearance'giving, denial to the rumors re
cently circulated that he was' ailing.
Having knelt/at the altar, he turned to
salute, the diplomats. . Then he "knelt
again and bowed in the direction of his'
grandmother, who watched the ceremony
from a private tribune in the- Queen's
chapel. Then came the Queen" Regent and
the other of the royal family.
In the front row before the altar stood
the. Count of Caserta, Prince Charles, the
Princess of the Asiurias and Â¦ the Queen
Regent; In the t second the Countess of
Caserta, the. King and Archduke Eugene:
In ' the third the Duke and ' Duchess j of
Calabria and the Infantas, and ',in the
fourth Prince Gennaro and his sisters.
The Queen â¢ Regent, in a robe of ; light
cream. , wore the crown. The Princess of
the Asturias was in white. The ceremony
lasted half an hour. Mass followed. The
Cardinal blessed : the rings and coins and
placed the coins in the bride's palms and
then the hands of the bridegroom' above

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 14.â So far. as argument
was concerned Smith of Kern fought the
Senate to a standstill this afternoon. He
made the Governor's bill appropriating
$100,000 for the protection of the health
of the Â¦ State look like -4he much-abused
GO cents,, and only the thing was. fixed
to go through It would have been a sorry
tfay -for the Governor's pet measure. The
bill came up on second reading, .and In
defiance of an agreement made in com
mittee that Its consideration should be
delayed some days It was taken up.
Rowell and Luchslnger objected, urging
the committee agreement as a reason for
postponement, but they finally wilted,
withdrawing their objections. Then Tay
lor rose and offered an amendment cut
ting the $100,000 down to $20,000. Taylor
argued t>hat $100,000 appropriated at
this time would be an admission
that there was plague in Califor
nia, and he believed with . the $28,
000 already at the disposal of .the Gov
ernor $20,000 would be ample. Belshaw
argued that at any time the State Board
of Examiners could create a deficiency
and raise as much money as. would be
necessary. Then Smith of Kern spoke in
favor of the amendment, but ended by

asking time to consider the bill. He said
bis vote for the bill would mean that he
believed plague did exist in the. State, and
he was not yet willing to declare that to
be his belief. , .
He moved that the consideration of the
bill go over until Wednesday next. Cut-'
ter moved the previous question, fearing
that some of the weaker knees counted
upon would bend under .the strain. The
previous question was lost, however, the
time for Assembly bills, under which or
der the measure was being discussed,
was continued indefinitely and the debate
went on. . Wolfe, Lukens and Selvage all
opposed the postponement, and then
Smith was allowed to close the discus
sion.. He closed It very much as a shell
bursts at the end of its, flight.
In speaking to the postponement Smith
tore the theory of the bill to shreds.' He
pictured the supporters of the bill deny
ing the "existence of plague In. the State,
yet asking % 100,000 to preveni it from
spreading to protect the State from some
thing that did not exift. He. demanded
what would.be the result if he asked
for $100,000 to protect the town. of Bakers
rteld from cholera. "I would be asked if
there was cholera in Bakersfleld," he con
tinued, "and I would say 'Not on .your
life.' Bakersfleld is too healthy a place
for cholera.
"Then I would be asked if cholera was
likely to come there, and again I would
Bay, 'Not on your life.' And If I stijl
demanded $100,000 for the protection of
Bakersfleld from cholera what kind of an
ass^ would I be? And that is just the
position in which some of the Senators
are, whipping this bill through with a
party lash that has shown Itself in this
benate this afternoon. If reports show
that there is plague In this State I. will
vote for this appropriation, . but I will
nor be whipped -with it to-day." ;
The roll was then called and the motion
to postpone was lost. There was more
discussion on the merits of the amend
ment. Smith of Kern leading in the
theory that with $20,000 appropriated and

PLAN FOR JUNKETING
TRIP TO SAN PEDRO
Bill Which Was Defeated Two Years
Ago Again Makes Its
Appearance. -
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 14.â This session of the
Legislature has already become notorious
for uselgss and expensive junketing trips,
but it has remained for "Colonel" Martin
Brady's Committee on Commerce and
Navigation to cause the introduction of' a
bill, which was defeated two years ago as
a piece of undesirable legislation, for the
sole purpose of getting a junket out of.lt.
The bill Is the old measure creating a
Board of State Harbor Commissioners for
San Pedro. It was introduced yesterday
by Broughton. and th-is morning a resolu
tion was put in by the committee and
adopted authorizing the committee of nine
members and its secretary to visit San
Pedro.
The trip will cost the State some $1200.
The people of San Pedro and vicinity do
not want the bill passed, and no faction
even of its population has Interested it
self in the bill's Introduction. The initia
tive was taken by the committee that
wanted another fat junketing trip.
Broughton says he has no Interest in
the bill, and that so far a3 he knows
there is no one In Southern California
who wants it passed. He says frankly that
it was- given to him to introduce by a
member of the Assembly. He laughingly
refuses to say who that member is. but
will not deny that he was a member of
the Committee on Commerce and Naviga
tion. _.
Two weeks ago Assemblyman Savage
of Ssji Pedro was In conversation with
"Colonel" Brady and several others, in
cluding ex-Assemblyman "Jack" Crowly
of San Francisco; who is now clerk to
the minority. Brady was talking In char
acteristic vein of junkets he was plan
ning â one to Paris on the Paris Commis
sion investigation and one to Honolulu en
the Welch leper settlement resolution.
Savage jokingly said be would resurrect
the fcan Pedro harbor bill and Introduce
it so that Brady's committee might take
a trip to San Pedro.
ThÂ£ joke was not lost on Brady and his
friends. A few days later Crowly was
fesyching industriously through the rec
ords of the session of 1S39 for the old San
Pedro bill. There was some difficulty in
finding it and consequent delay, but at
]a*t it was unearthed, a typewritten copy
made of it and the copy passed up to the
iiccornmodating : Broughton for introduc
tion.
Two years ago Knowland was chairman
of the Committee on Commerce and Navi
gation, and the bill, then Introduced In
good faith, made a junket necessary. He
took a Fub-committee of five on the trip,
and the mileage bill exceeded JoiO. The
committee broupht in an adverse report
and the bill was killed. .
Assemblyman Savage is very much ex
ercised- over the results of his Joking con
versation. He is strongly opposed to the
bill, and fearing that the committee will
seek to Justify its trip by returning a re
port in favor of the passage of the bill
he will make the trip to Ban Pedro with
the committee at his own expense. He
has already telegraphed jto leading citi
zens of San. Pedro to be ready with con
vincing arguments against the bill. The
committee will leave to-morrow.
ARCHITECTS THE NEXT

provides for the appointment by the Gov
ernor of a Board of Architecture .to be

divided into a northern and a southern
district, the division line being the north
erly linos of San Luis Obispo, Kern and

tificates to practice architecture.
MINOR VICTORY FOB Sj 3>iC
â¢ THE TEACTION COMPANY
Caldwell's Amendment to Franchise
Bill Adopted by the Senate
'V Committee.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 14.â The Los Angeles Trac
tion Company scored one on the Southern
Pacific before the Senate Cbrnmittee on
Municipal Corporations when Caldwell's
amendment .to the franchise ' bill was
adopted by the committee,- but It was
a small vfctory. . The . bill had two fea
tures which It was hoped would be
chan'ged. One allowed competitive bid
ding after the sealed bids were opened
ana another which made the advertise
ment .of a franchise compulsory. One
amendment submitted knocked out the
bidding after the opening of sealed bids,
but the amendment was -killed..
The other amendment sought to allow
the granting of a franchise upon petition
of the owners of two-thirds of the prop
erty fronting on the proposed franchise
without advertising for competition, but
this, too, was killed. Caldwell's amend
ment was made after the amendment
striking out the -open bidding had
been lost. He added a clause that re-'
quired the putting up of a check the size
of the new bid whenever a bid should be
made in open competition, the amount of
the check being made forfeltable to the
city In case of attempts to evade the bid.
This was adopted.
Then Taylor submitted an amendment
so changing the. bill as to make it require
readvertlsing upon the release or exten
sion of any franchise, and this was adopt
ed. Taylor had a long string of amend
ments, but none of them except the one
mentioned prevailed. He Intends to sub
mit a minority report when the bill Is sent
back. The committee recommendation
will be that it do pass as amended. In all
the votes except two the committee stood:
For the amendmentsâ Taylor, Caldwell
and Smith of Los Angeles; against themâ
Ashe, Shortridge, Devlin and Tyrrell pf
San Francisco. On the amendment- re
quiring the presentation of checks on open
bidding Ashe went over to the other side.
On Taylor's successful amendment Ashe
also voted with the minority, but Cald
well went to the majority.

' CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 14.â Senator Tyrrell of San
Francisco Introduced, a bill to-day, the
purpose of which is to limit the opera
tion of civil service regulations.
Section 1 of the bill is as, follows:
"Whenever any person v/ithiri this State
phall hold any office or position of public

appointment have offered to take such
oath, it shall be unlawful to remove
such person from such office or position
of public trust because such person has
not complied with some or any provision
of any law, charter or regulation pre
scribing an -additional test or qualifica
tion for such office or position of public
trust, and any person who is removed or
threatened. with removal from any office
or position of public trust under any pre
tense or device whatever, if the real rea
son be because of non-compliance -with
provisions requiring such additional test
or qualification, shall be entitled to re
strain such unlawful removal or to en
force restoration by process of injunction
both prohibitory, and mandatory." T â¢
The second section of the bill provides
that any person in authority may- be re
strained from removing such official from
office by prohibitory and mandatory in
junction.
If it becomes a law- It will nullify the
civil service provisions of the charter of
San Francisco.

fuel to generate light.
A company operating under the pro
visions of Butler's bill could not collect
more than five cents a month for a 31
candle lamp. Only two cents a month
could be collected for a 14-candle lamp.
Section 2 of the bill makes It unlawfurfor
any company to place a meter or other
appliance for the purpose of fixing tho
rates to be charged for furnishing electric
lights.
Assemblyman' Butler claims that he
framed the bill himself. If he were in.
possession of some knowledge of the sub
ject when he framed the measure he ought
to be able to tell the committee how much
it costs per kilowatt hour to produce light.
Let him estimate oil for fuel at 90 cents
a barrel and make his calculations pn that
basis.
Of course. Butler's San Francisco con
stituents want cheap light. Martin Kelly
languishes for the lowest rate of illumi

the situation could easily become more

Lord Salisbury Replies.
Lord Salisbury roÂ£e leisurely and added :
his congratulations to. the mover and sec- ;

fer to the manner in which the country's
loss had been received throughout the

and abundantly bcrne out. If so.' it would
be ihe greatest triumph for the people of

Lord Salisbury thought there was nothing
unusual in the length of the campaign.
He rtf erred Lord Kimberley to the In
dian mutiny and the American war, be
tween which and the South. African cam
paign there was a great resemblance. In
Bosnia it took two years and the whole
power of Austria to conquer the peas
ants. Where great enthusiasm and per
sistency existed in a country like So.uth
Africa months must elapse before-tran
quillity could be restored. Therefore he
did not believe there was any real ground
for the discontent or apprehensions .ex
pressed by Lord Kimberley. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦
The House of Commons, after ' a brief

brought in from the King thanking the

CHICAGO, Feb. 14.â Flames were set
simultaneously on four floors of the
Palmer House this afternoon and forty
five minutes later were discovered on two
floors in the Great Northern Hotel. Two
men supposed to "be hotel thieves were
seen- to tun from the Palmer House.
During the excitement $500 worth of Jew
elry was stolen from one of the rooms of
the Great Northern.
About the same time a blaze was dis
covered in ., the Sherman House. The
four fires convince" the police that an
organized gang of Incendiaries Is operat

been secured of the two men who were
seen running from the Palmer House and
a number of detectives are at work on the
case. The four fires, with time of dis
covery and attending incidents, were:

for the men suspected of having started
the fires.- These officers, as well as the
hotel managers, have the theory that -the

grudge and was able to do so through his
intimate knowledge of opportunities.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.â The events in
connection with the sale of the old New
York Custom-house to the National City
Bank occupied the center of the stage
during the debate on the sundry civil ap
propriation bill in the House to-day. Much
excitement attended the debate. McRae
of Arkansas raised tho Issue with a mo
tion to strike out the appropriation for
rent of the Custom-house, and with this
motion as a basis Jones of Virginia
launched a fierce attack upon the manner
and circumstances of the sale and the
vast profits which he claimed the bank
made out of the transaction. Secretary
Gage, was sharply criticized and severe
references were made to the letters writ
ten by Hepburn to Secretary Gage apro
pos of the political claims of the bank.
Hopkins of Illinois turned the tables
on the Democrats by springing upon them
a. series of letters written by prominent
Democrats, including Senator Jones of
Arkansas, to the Secretary of the Treas
ury under the Cleveland administration,
asking the deposit of Government funds
in banks with Democratic proclivities His
center shot was a letter written bv Rcd
resentative Richardson of Tennessee in
behalf of a Tennessee bank.
McRae's amendment was lost on a strict
party vote and another amendment, of
fered by Richardson, to provide that the
rent should not be paid until the title

The Senate met at 8 o'clock to-night and
at 6:35. on finishing reading of the Dis
trict of Columbia code bill, adjourned.
Caffery of Louisiana and Money of Mis
sissippi took the Massachusetts Senator
sharply to task for his observations relat
ing to the river and harbor bill. Money
Fug-gested to Lodge that if a wholesale
and genuine economy was really- desired
by the majority they could cut off $100,000,
0)0 a year in the army and navy by stop
ping the war in the Philippines.
Teller's amendment finally was with
drawn and an amendment offered by Hale,
ptrlking out the v.-ords "to map the soils
of the United States." and Inserting the
following: "For investigations of the
Foils in the United States and for indicat
ing upon marts or plats by coloring or oth
Â«rwtse the results of such investigations."
Dolliver, at the conclusion of the read
ins of the bill for committee amendments,
offered an amendment providing for Gov
ernment inspection and certification of
dairy products intended to be exported,
which, after some discussion, went over
until to-morrow.
"We are pushing along," said Lodge, "to
the billion dollar mark in our appropria
tions and we have to draw the line.
"W'e have reached the point now where the
people are becoming alarmed."
Lodge of Massachusetts said any person
Â¦who would evamine attentively appropria
tions being made by Congress would real
ize readily the dangers in which the Gov
ernment was running. It was an open
secret, be t-aid. that tne river and harbor
bill was in danger of failure, because It
Â¦was loaded down with appropriations of
neither immediate nor Imperative import
ance. International expositions with Gov
ernmental aid had been an organized in
dustry, as had the Eelllng to the Govern
ment of battlefields.
Hale urged that there was no demand
from the hard-headed farmers of the
country for this scheme. "When we get
to the end of this Congress." continued
he. "and figure i;p the appropriations they
will be found to be larger, yea, very much
larger than have ever, been made before
by an American Congress."
Chandler joined Hale In the warning
against extravagant appropriations. Ba
con of Georgia and Hansborough and ilc-
Cumber of North Dakota supported tho
amendment.
"'Is there to be no stop to the schemes
for depleting the treasury? This will cost
JlÂ«0,uw.Ou0. it will never step until every
county is mapped."
Proctor. In charge of the bill, eaid that
the amendment called for only $91,iKM.
Pettus of Alabama directed the Senate'*
attention to two word pictures, one of a
proposition to spend $225.uO0 ( 00u for the
t>enetlt of ship owners and chip builders
of the country and the other of a project
to spend less than JlOi'.W for the benefit
of more than half of the population of
the United States.
Consideration of the agricultural appro
priation bill was then resumed, the pend
ing, question being the amendment of
Teller striking out the provision for the
mapping of uie agricultural soils of the
Vnited States. Hale joined in the fight
against the provision.
A resolution was offered by Stewart
and agreed to, calling upon the Attorney
General iox all accounts of the Second
Ju<ycial District of Alaska and tho action
of the department thereon; and a list of
the 'officers of the Second Judicial Dis
trict of Alaska and their compensation.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.-The Senate
devoted practically the entire day to the
agricultural appropriation bill. The meas
ure was not completed. Hale of Maine
and Lodge of Massachusetts sounded
rotes of warning against the enormous ap
propriations being made by thÂ© present
Congress. Hale declared the people of
the country soon would become alarmed
and then those who were responsible for
the immediate expenditures would seek
the rocks and mountains to hide from the
wrath of the people. Lodge eaid that the
appropriations were setting near the bil
lion-dollar mark and that it was time to
craw the line.
Says That the Appropriations Are
Fast Approaching the Billion
Dollar Mark and the Pub
lic Is Alarmed.
Urges Congress to Beware of

HALE SOUNDS
STRONG WARNING
Custom officials were to-day furnished
with Secretary Gage's order placing a
countervailing duty on Russian sugar.
Regular duty on refined sugar is $1 95 per
hundred pounds. With the addition of
the countervailing duty, which order goes
into effect to-day, the duty on Russian
sugar will be $2 64 per hundred pounds,
and will practically prohibit its Importa
tion.
Those well Informed regarding the feel
ing of Russia in regard to the Imposition
of the countervailing duty on Russian su
gar pay that the Government will prob
ably not sanction a judicial determination.
M. de Witte declared in most positive
terms that no bounty or grant was paid
on sugar, and it Is believed he will be
greatly chagrined over the failure of this
Government to accept the statement at its
full value.
This statement was made to-day by
Count Cassini. Russian Embasaador, when
he was questioned relative to the action
of the Treasury Department in imposing
a countervailing duty on Russian sugar.
Count Cassini is certain of the justice of
his Government's position that no bounty
or grant, within the meaning of the Ding
ley law. is paid to sugar producers. He
pointed out to-day the gTeat increase in
trade between the Unites States and Rus
sia in recent years, and he proposes to
continue his efforts to foster it.

THE approaching: Bllver Ju
bilee of Santa Clara Col
lege suggested to Father
Kenna that an effort should
be made to complete the
adornment of the chapel of the In
stitution by filling the chapel win
dows with appropriate designs In
stained glass. The first to respond
was a lady whose iiberallty toward
the church Is well known, but who
declines to have her name men
tioned In connection with her gifts.
She donated a window about, fif
teen feet In height and three and
a half feet In breadth. It consists
of a base and canopy In the Ital
ian style, besides the center piece.
The subject is the apparition of
Our Lady of Lourdes to the peas
ant girl In the grotto. The fig
ure of the Virgin Is beautifully de
signed and the expression of coun
tenance wonderfully sympathetic.
The colors of the robes and acces
sories are literally as described -by
the girl to whom the vision was
vouchsafed. The kneeling figure
of the peasant, clothed In homely
g-arb, is both lifelike and graceful.
The coloring Is in the highest.de
gree harmonious. The execution is
fully equal to European methods.
Father Kenna has given consid
erable attention to the quality of
the work of local artists and de
cided that the window was in ev
ery respect the equal of any pro
duced in Munich or elsewhere on
the Continent. The cost of the
window is about $1000.

MANY MILLIONS
FOR CARNEGIE
This Is the only way known to us by which
the American people can show practically
their admiration for the grallant struggle of
the South African burghers and for the great
principles for which the burghers fight.
A, number of prominent, residents of the
Kastern States have already signed the protest.
As soon as a sufficient number of signature!!
to It has been obtained we Intend to Insert
the protest as an advertlBement In the leading
lflitlsh newspapers and to leave It standing
Â»s lonir as our funds permit, with a statement
beneath giving tha. number who have signed
It and. such names from among them as are
likely to be known In, England. .
W'b purpose to administer that shock, so fas
as possible, by crystallizing the pro-Boer sym
rsthy of the majority of Americans and by
taking steps to bringr the rer-ultâ In the iorm
of a brief protestâ to the notice of the British
people This, in our opinion, will do mdre than
anything else coulii do at this time to ehakw
the blind confidence of many Englishmen In
tho righteousness of their cause.
The British people have been deceived In re
gard to public sentiment here. â¢ They have been
led to believe that they, have the moral sup
port of America In their dealings with the
Boero, and Mr. Chamberlain's claim that some
scrt of an alliance had been entered into by
him with this countryâ a claim immediately
rejected by the administration hereâ was made
la order to foster this erroneous belief. The
majority of the English newspapers are so
bitterly â¢ anti-Boer that they do not publish
nÂ«ws that might open the eyes of their readers
on this subject; they know that "the man In
the street." upon whose support Mr. Chamber
lain depends. feel9 that In Europe hÂ» stands
among euemles. and Is, therefore, not only
anxlous to conciliate and to preserve the good
opinion of the Americans, but would be
sbocked to learn that the action of his Gov
ernment had already alienated, and threatens
to alienate still further, much of the friendly
feeling- for Great Britain which at one time
'existed in this country.
With this end in view, It becomes of the ut
most importance to evoke such an expression of
popular feeling In tha United States that thÂ«
people of Great Britain, Ireland and the Brit
ish Colonies will be made to realise at last
that the large majority of Americans look with
extreme disfavor upon tha continued slaughter
and threatened extermination of the citizens of
the South African Republic and Orange Free
State.
Realizing that direct interference In tha
South African strugr&le is not within the
province of the American Government,
this committee is of the opinion that the
people of this country can do what the
Government cannot do. It desires In any
case to remove the impression which pre
vails in England that Americans view
with indifference the , threatened . exter
mination of the citizens of the two South
African republics:, and the means to tht3
end, which the committee of the league
has adopted are certainly novel. The fol
lowing statement has been issued by tha
committee:. \ , >\> *:- :
TVo are convinced that a very larars number
of people In this country, if they only knew
how, would gladly help the Boers in their
struggle for freedom. Heretofore the question
with most of us has been: What con wÂ« do to
help them?
It has been susyesttd to us recently, and we
heartily approve tha suggestion, that we can
best help the Boers by Influencing llrltish pub
lic opinion in favor of Justice and peace in
South Africa. It is evident that so vast arÂ»
the resources of the British empire In compari
son with those of the South African Republics
that unless tlie history of our own war of in
dependence soon repeats Itself in this case, to
the point at which the majority of the British
people concluded that there was neither gain
nor glory In its continuance, the republics
might, in the course of time, become tempo
rarily exhausted. The sooner, then, that the
British people can be brought Â¦ to- the point
which they reached i In their war with us, the
better it will be for them, for South, Africa and
for the whole world.

This success has been secured entirely
upon its merits as a dlgrestive pure and
simple, because there can be no Btomach
trouble If the fcod is promptly digested
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entirely
on the food oaten, digesting it completely
ko that it can be assimilated Into blood'
nerve and tissue. They cure dyspepsia
water brash, sour stomach, gas and bloat-
ing after meals, because they furnish the
digestive power which weak stomachs
lack, and unless that lack is supplied it is
useless to attempt to cure by the use of
"tonics." "pills" and cathartics, which
have absolutely no digestive power.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
at all drugstores, and the regular use of
one or two of them after meals will dem-
onstrate their merit better than any other
argument.
This Is the secret. If there Is any se-
cret, of the remarkable success of Stu-
art'* Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy prac-
tically unknown a few years ago and now
the most widely known of any treatment
for Btomach weakness.
Stuart'* Tablet? <3o not act upon the
boweis like after-dinner pUle and cheaD
cathartlcfi, which simply irritate and in-
f.ame the intestines without having anv
effect whatever in digesting food or cur-
ing indlgf-Ftion.
If the ptomach can be rested and as
Fisted in the work of digestion u will verv
poon recover its normal vigor, as no or-
gan is eo much abused and overworked
as the stomach.
The remedy Is In the form of pleasant
tasting tablets or lozenges, containing
v* RPtable and fruit essences, pure aseptic
pf-jysin (Government test>. golden seal and
diafit.-i?Â«Â». Th* tablets are sold by drug-
gists under the name of Stuart's Dyspep-
Â«a Tablets. Mar.y interesting experi-
ments to t^st the digestive power of Stu-
art's Tablets Fhow that one grain of the
active principle contained in them is suf-
ficient to thoroughly digest 3000 grains of
raw meat, eggs and other wholesome
food.
The remedy is not heralded as a wonder-
ful discovery, nor yet a eecret patent

anything except dyspepsia, indigestion
snd etomach troubles, â¢with which nine out
of t*mi suffer.

TOMMY BURNS' superb riding, the
disqualifying. of Silurian, a 15 to 1
winner In the mile handicap for
three-year-olds and â¢ up; and
'Greenock's victory, over Gonfalon
Â¦were the features of the racing yesterday
at Tanforan Park. A fair-sized crowd
jostled In the ring and enjoyed what wa$
generally pronounced a day's good sport.
When Silurian, with 'J'_ "Walsh up, beat
out such good company as Advance
Guard and Telamon, a shout of dis
gruntled disappointment roso from the
players of first and second choices. The
few Silurian ticket-hplders made a rush
to cash in. But something happened at
the turn into the stretch that put Silurian
back a few million years as far as the
cashing of the Si tickets was con.
cerned. "Walah committed what was a
palpable though unintentional foul. His
horse swerved against Telamon, cutting
ofC both Telamon and Advance Guard.
Walsh. O'Connor and r > Henry were called
into the stand after the race and all
agreed, Walsh declaring that he could not
prevent the misdeed. It lay with the
judges then to do as they willed with
Silurian, so they placed the colt last.
O'Connor on Advance Guard made a wait
ing race, fighting It out neck and neck
at the finish with Telamon. Tha order
under the wire was Silurian, Advance
Guard and Telamon, all three being
driven and hard pressed. Pupil came In
for the show when the disqualification
was announced. . â¢
Of all Tommy Burns' clever work yes
terday, that in the last race was the most
brilliant, and the race itself was tha most
exciting of the day. The route was one
and a quarter miles for four-year-olds
and was conceded to lie between Oreenock
and Gonfalon. At the stretch Gonfalon,
with Henry up. was In the lead by a
lei:Â£th. Then began a struggle of speed
and courage a,nd strength. Whipping and
lashing, Henry worked Gonfalon hard,
but Greenock closed in every second. It
was hard telling just how the finish would,
be, for the. distance grew shorter and
shorter. Almost within reach of the wire
Greenock passed in ahead of Gpnfalon,
winning by. a neck. . v
The second race was a triangular Â¦ af
fair, Goal Runner, Lady Meddlesome and
Vohicer being scratched. Tommy Burns
on Handicapper ran away from Donator
and Mocorlto in the stretch. ' Donator
got the place.
Montanic led a procession in a field of
eight In the third 'race, a seven-furlong
event. His light was too far In advance
for the others to follow by its flashy di
rection and they trailed out like Chinese
Prejudice got the place. The Pride, a 7
to 10 favorite, the show.
The fifth race lay between Esplrando
and Edinborough, the first and second
choices. Espirando took the front rank
at the stretch and was first under the
wire.

ception accorded him at Oakland
track yesterday. His magnificent work,
never surpassed in this part of the coun
try, was a revelation, and when he
dropped the bunting to a perfect start In
the opening event he received a tremen
dous ovation, the applause continuing for
some minutes. Exacting but just with the
riders, he informed them before the rac
ing began that if they complied with his
requests and lined up at the barrier there
would be no necessity for fines. During
the afternoon" in the different events the
riders lined thÂ«Jr mounts up and without
perceptible delay six beautiful start* were
accomplished.
Last night at the resorts frequented by
horsemen Holtman's sensational starting
was the all-absorbing topic of conversa
tion.
The attendance at the track across the
bay :s daily increasing, and betting in the
ring continues to improve. Nine books
laid prices yesterday in the ring, besides
two field books, an Increase of one over
the last cut in. The track was heavy and
slow, long shots dividing the card with
first choices. Phil Archibald, 9 to 1; Su
nello. a 12 to 1 shot, and Clarando at 15
to 1 furnished the surprises.
A mile selling run, for v /itch Ostler Joe
with John' Bullman up. ciosed favorite,
opened proceedings. Bujlman in his anx
iety to get away earned a $23 fine, after
which he settled down. Finally catching
the favorite and Joe Rlpley straight, the
barrier was released and for forty yards
,the eight starters ran almost head and
head before Almoner went to the front.
The latter led until well Into the stretch,
when he was passed by both Ostler Joe
and Ripley. Bullman outrode little Bro
dien and the favorite won by a length.
In a previous race Compass had demon
strated that a heavy track was not to
his liking. Nevertheless the filly was made
favorite for the second event, finishing an
indifferent third. - Homage looked a win
ner into the stretch, but tired and was
led out by Phil Archibald, excellently rid
den by Frawley.
Felix Carr started Corrlgan again in the
four furlong dash for two-year-olds, and
the black colt lost his company. A 4 to 5
chance, he waa never headed, downing
Tyranus by five open lengths. Botany
ran Into phow. x
"Lena was backed to win the mile and

as if the result had already been an

Sunello. ridden by Materne, slipped away

lengths before the favorite. llansch

Even money looked a long price against

not come off. It la reported that the ques
tion of the $500 forfeit was under consider
ation this afternoon and that this was
the principal cause of the adjournment
until to-morrow afternoon without deflnita
The cases against Jeffries and Ruhlln,
charged with training for a prize-fight,
were to have been heard this afternoon.
Prosecuting Attorney Hoffmeyer says ho
will drop them if the defendants abide by
the injunction .without appeal.
Lack of definite Information from the
promoters to-night Is believed to be due
to some controversy over the forfeit and
not to any question regarding the injunc
tion. The promoters announced that they
would abide by the decree of the court
absolutely.
Mayor Flelschmann. who granted a per
mit for the contest, was in communication
with the Governor during the afternoon
and afterward he stated to the presa that
hÂ© would offer the whole police force of
Cincinnati to the Sheriff as the officer of
the court If there was any attempt what
ever to disregard ' the injunction. "Tha
action of the court." he said, "practleal'.y
revoke* my license for a boxlngr contea:.
Tha law will be obeyed and there will bÂ«
no need for troops here."
To-night there is much disappointment
among a large number of citizens, notably
among them the turners and the German
sfnjring societies, which took great inter
est in the old Saengerfest organization
and Us unfortunate financial experience.
The decree of the court permanently re
strains the managers of the contestants
and the Saengerfest Athletic Association
and all connected with the proj>osed event
from participating at Saengerfest Hall on
any date.
Attorneys for the defendants srave no
tice of appeal and took exceptions to the
law and facts in the finding of the court.
If the case is carried to the court of last
resort it is expected that counsel on both
sides will agree upon a mere entry In the-
Circuit Court ana proceed thence to the
Supreme Court next Tuesday. Since tha
issue has been raised on an allesred dis
tinction between prize-flg-hts and'berxinff
contests, interested parties on both sides
seem now to want a decision In the court
of last resort in Ohio for a precedent in
the future, even if the present event Is in
definitely postponed or declared off. aa
seems most probable.
In reviewing the testimony. Judge HoN
lister praised that of Manager Brady, in
which he testified that the contestants
would do their best to win and that any
other kind of a meeting between Jeffries
and Ruhlin would be a faks on the pub
lic. He severely reviewed the testimony
of Manager Madden, who held that there
had oeen no prize-fights since the day oC
Sullivan and that . the proposed contest
here was to be onÂ© on points rather than
on merit.
The court cited cases at great length. In
deciding the following points:
Firstâ That the propoied contest vu to bÂ»
a priz*-flÂ«ht in fact, and as such is prohibited
under the Ohio statutes, and that the conten
tions of the defendant! that they proposed to
give a boxing contest had not been maintained.
Second â That the proposed fight would con
stitute a public nuisance such as court* of
equity are bound to restrain.
Thirdâ That as a court of equity he had thÂ»
power to Â«njoln the fluht. although there was
legal remedy after Its occurrence.
Fourthâ That in view of all the circum

f^? INCINNATT, Feb. 14.-There will
fl be no contest between Jeffries and
UL_j> Ruhlln or any one else In Saenger-
fest Hall In this city to-morrow
and no other date has been fixed
for the event Neither will there be any
mobilization of troops outside of the hall
or anywhere else to-morrow night or any
other time in thjs city to keep Jeffries and
Ruhlin from meetihjr there. A perma
nent Injunction issued by Judge Holllster
to-day against the proposed championship
contest to-morrow night or at any other
time has caused the indefinite postpone
ment of the arrangements of the State
and county officials as well as the pro
moters of the contest.
Those who have been opposing the fight
are very Jublfant and the promoters are
correspondingly depressed over the devel
opments of to-day. Some of the vlsltlns;
sporting editors left to-night while other.-*
enjoyed a social session with the fight
managers. Jeffries and Ruhlin still main
tain their quarters, but they are not doln*
much training: and both expect to leave
for their respective theatrical engage
ments next Saturday night.
When the joint confeience of fight man
agers and Saengerfest Hall directors ad
journed to-night it was announced that
another meeting would be held to-morrow
to determine whether the case would be
appealed and whether the contest would
be postponed to any set date.
There was very little sale of tickets to
day, although the Sacngerfest people an
nounced that all money received for tick
ets would be refunded if the fight doe*
BRUISING BOUTS ARE
FOUGHT BY AMATEURS
Past Fights Were the Rule at the
San Francisco Athletic Club
Last Night, f *,Â£
There -was fighting with a vengeance
at the San Francisco Athletic Club last
evening. Seven bouts were presented and
but two went the limit. Knock-outs and
gore were plentiful and the hardened ring
goers went away in a satisfied frame of
mind.
Jack Cordell and Ed Finnerty opened
hostilities. They boxed four rounds in a
tamo fashion and Cordell was declared the
winner. Joe Brodshaw piled into Jack
Hopkins and settled his visions of glory
before half the round had progressed.
Hopkins rubbed his nose on the canvas
and did not open hla eyes until the shout
ing was over. When he did awaken to a
realization of his defeat the first sight
that met his gaze was his father vainly
expostulating with Referee Greggains
that his young hopeful had been fouled.
Hopkins looked as if he dreaded the
further beating he would get for losing
the bout.
Hughie Frlel landed on Charles Stevens"
proboscis and that young man sat down
on the canvas and declined to continue.
The bout was lively whle It lasted, but
Friel was the hardest hitter and won out
in one round. 'Â»Â»'â¢
Charles Ryan and Jack Murray put up
the best fight of the night. They slammed
each otfjer In a manner that would bring
Joy. to the most' blase ring-goer. Ryan
was ' stronger and landed oftener. but
Murray was determined and possessed
grit in large quantities. The decision of
the judges, who declared the bout a draw,
met with favor. Billy McDonald tried
some of Terry McGovern's tactics on
Eddie Devlin and before the last round
was reached Devlin looked as If he had
passed through a threshing machine.
McDonald was so eager to win that he
fought like a wild bull. Greggalns stopped
the bout before the close of the fourth
round. Mike Curtain gained a decision
over Ed Nealon. a modest youth, who was
built on the eiraffa plan. .
Billy Snallham, the â¢ little whirlwind
amateur bantam champion of the coast,
made short work of Billy Mifrphy. He
knocked Murphy down and out before
the close of the first round.

PAINTER NUTT FALLS INTO PILE OF MORTAR
AND THE LIME DESTROYS ONE OF HIS EYES
"The application for a renewal of the
mortgage incurred by Mr. Sutro was made
to the court some months 'ago, .but at no
time were Mrs. Kluge or her attorneys
consulted in regard to. the matter. The
first intimation I had that I had consulted
with Van R. Paterson. her" attorney,
was -when I read of it. I can understand
that Mrs. Klug^ was not averse to affix
ing her signature to the mortgage. While
such a prorcec-dlng might give her a cer
tain standing in the community, it could
have no weicht in tht; case now before
th,e court. 1 emphatically repeat that Mrs.
Kluge has not received the slightest recog
nition by cither the heirs or myself and
hfr signature to the mortgage was ob
j tained by the bank on its own account
I and without our knowledge. The mort
gage covers an old loan, and even if Mrs.
Klugo would ultimately be acknowledged
as ore of the' heirs by the court she would
only be entitled to hpr share of the residue
after the loan had been paid out of the
proceeds of the sale of the property."
"To * eupDose that the participation of
Mrs. Kluge In this mortgage or any mort
gage on the Sutro estate is a recognition
of her claims by the Sutro heirs is, of
course, absurd." said Reuben Lloyd in
discussing the matter yesterday. "It was
the HIbernia Bank, the mortgagee, alone
that desired the signature or Mrs. Kluge;
and that for reasons known to every one
famiHar with the attitude of banks to
ward contestants. The bank, in the abun
dance of its caution, simply desirefl to be
protected in the event of there being any
recognition by the courts of Mrs. Kluge's
claim.
\ Re-uben H. Lloyd, attorney for the heirs
! of the Sutro estate, denies that either he
or his clients have in any way recognized
I the claims of Mrs. Clara Kluge. who has
i contested the Adolnh Sutro will on the
' part of her two children, whom ehe al
' leges to be the offspring of the dead mll
! lionaire. The conclusion that Mrs. Mer
! ritt. executrix of the estate, together with
j the other heirs, had been Indirectly forced
i by the Hibernia Bank to acknowledge the
'claim' of Mrs. Kluge was arrived at be
| cause her name had been affixed to a
j mortgage ! on property belonging to the
I estate. The mortgage was recor'ded yes

Professor Mead comes from an old
American famiiy and. although but 43
years of age, has won laurels in his chosen
profession. He is a native of Patriot,
Ind., and graduated from the scientific
and agricultural departments of Pardue
University and from the civil engineering
department of Iowa University. He has
held many important public positions. He
is not unused to a professorship, as he has
held chairs In a number of Eastern col
leges. Since 1SJ9 he has been the Irriga
tion expert of the United States Govern
ment. . Â»
An -important part has been played by
Professor Mead in advancing the inter
ests Of irrigation. During eleven years of
service as Territorial and then as State
Engineer of Wyoming he rescued that
State from the confusion into which It
had been thrown- by its poor system of
irrigation law and established a new sys
tem which serves as a- model to other
States.
Professor Mead Is at present at Chey
enne. During his recent trip East Pres
ident Wheeler made the necessary ar
rangements for securing the services of
Professor Mead, and while his action
lacks as yet the formal approval of the
regents, tacit consent has been given by
a majority of them to make his appoint
ment public. Regents Wallace, Foster
and Houghton, the only ones present, said
that no objection could be made against
this course.
While remaining at the head of this Im
portant work. Professor Mead will make
his residence at Berkeley, become* a pro
fessor of the university and will devote
a portion of each semester to lecturing
there. He will lay the foundations of an
irrigation department which it Is planned
to develop into one of the most important
activities of the university.
Although no quorum was present yester
day at the meeting' of the Regents of the
University of California at the Hopkins
Institute. President Wheeler was author
ized to announce that a. . new ami most
Important department, to be known as the
department of irrigation, would be or

FEAR TO LOSE
MANILA TRADE
Need of Dirtct Steamship
Line Discussed by Busi
ness Bodies.
The Ship Owners' Association of the
Pacific Coast was requested to send a
delegation, but did not do so.
President W'atkins in calling the meet
ing to order stated that it was for. the
purpose of securing a direct' steamship
connection between this port and Manila.
Goods were being damaged in trans
shipment from Hongkong to Manila and j
â¢considerable pilfering- existed; all of
which resulted In a serious loss to San
Francisco merchants. â¢
President Watklns then told how a let
ter had been sent to the Pacific Mail ;
Steamship Company early last December,
calling the attention of the company to
the matter, but that the only reply re-,
celved was that Mr. Schwerin of the com
pany waa in New York and on his return
he would give the subject his attention.
Although Mr. Schwerin had returned at
theÂ«nd of December, no statement had
been received from him.
A." C. Rulofson said he had recently
seen and spoken to Mr. Schwerin and that
gentleman had informed him that the
Pacific Mail Company would not attend
the meeting, not having received an In
vitation to do'so. Regarding pilfering of
Roods sent to Manila. Mr. Schwerin. had
informed Mr. Rulofson that the steamship
company was not responsible for it and
that the poods must have been tampered
with on the docks at, Manila. Mr. Rulof
son cited an instance where 2000 cases of
beer had been shipped from San Fran
cisco to Manila, via Hongkong, and on
being repacked at Manila, It was found
that 10 per cent of the beer was missing.
The speaker had the assurance of Mr.
Schwerin that if the merchants of San
Francisco had the requisite amount of
Manila trade the steamship company
would put on direct steamers, but not
otherwise.
Â¦ T. J. Parsons of the Del Monte Mills
said that if Tacoma, Seattle and New
Ycrk could support a direct line of ships
to Manila, certainly San Frajicisco could
do so.
"We are suffering heavily," said Mr.
Parsons, " because we have no direct line
and if we had one it wou.d promptly put
an end to the pilfering on the docks at
Manila and during, the reshimpent at
Hongkong. The trouble Is that San Fran
cisco has not- taken as much Interest In
the matter as Other citieis have. Los An
geles has established a direct coast line
and Seattle has the Skaguay trade, us
ing twelve steamers. All the goods
shipped to Skaguay come from San Fran
cisco."
Sanford Bennett read a number of let
ters he had received from the Oregon antf
Oriental Steamship Company of Portland,"
Oregon, offering to put on two steamers
from San Francisco to Manila If sufficient
freight was guaranteed. The company
quoted a direct rate of 19 per ton,, as com
pared to $10 per ton now charged from
San Francisco to Hongkong, which, added
to J3 50 per ton for reshlpment from Hong
kong to Manila, made the through rate
J13 50.
â¢A general discussion of how to accept
the offer made was then participated in
by W. R. Wheeler, Horace Davis, Isaac
Upham, Hugo Rothschild and H.'D. Love
land. The last named uentleman 1 said
that the City, of Peking had recently left
this port for the Orient crowded with
Eastern freight and not a pound of San
Francisco freight had gone on the vessel.
This he said, was a constant occurrence.
"There is a necessitv for the line," said
Mr. Loveland, "and we will have no trou
ble in getting it. An olTer has been made:
don't let us sit down and see other cities
secure the trade which belongs to us."
C. Haswell of the Johnson-Locke Mer
cantile Company paid that three steam
ship companies which <us firm represented
were willing to put on vessels direct from
San Francisco to Manila, provided enough
freight was guaranteed. The ships were
American built and were under the Amer
ican flag and it would be better to secure
American ships for the trade than foreign,
ones, which, if Jhe Philippine Islands
wore made part of the Union, could not
carry freight between American ports.
On motion of Mr. Parsons, a resolution
was carried that President Watkins ap
point a committee, to consist of five large
exporters, to find out the amount of
freight which can he secured from San
Francisco for Manila and that the com
mittee confer with the various steamship
companies in the matter of securing direct
shipment between the two ports.
"Congressman S. D. Woods was then
Introduced to the meotlng by President
Watkins and received a hearty reception.
Congressman "W'oqds stated that he was
present to speak on .i matter in which
Congress needed an object lessonâ the
needs of California. The appropriations
asked for from Coneress for river and
harbor improvements in California had
been turned down and the Representa
tives and Senators from California had
thought that the Committee on River3
and Harbors should be Invited to visit the
State and see for itself the needs for the
appropriations asked for. An amendment
was now before the So-.jate on the appro-
Eriation bill and the California delegation
ad thought It Important enough for the
speaker to- come back to California and
secure invitations for the Committee on
Rivers and Harbors to visit the State.
Congressman Woods noped that the meet-
Ing would take some acticfn in the mat
ter and, If the committee was invited,
that the California delegation In Wash
ington should be asked to present the in
vitation to thn members of the River and
Harbor Committee.*
A resolution that tha invitation be ex
tended by the various commercial bodies
represented at the meeting was - then
passed and an adjournment was taken:

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
â¢ T , hc r e a " reasons f or fearing that husband-beating
is a too frequent practice; in that part of .the country,
and that few husbands are safe when their wives are
infuriated. There is a tradition that even John' L.
Sullivan, in the height of his career, once complained
in a Boston court that his wife was in the habit of
beating hiria unmercifully whenever he went home too
drunk to put up a fight and defend himself. Th<
Delaware bill may therefore be in the' interest of
wholesome household reform, but r 'all the same the
ht ?^?and who sends his wife to the whipping post'will
have a just claim upon the' sympathy of ; the world as
soon as the dame gcts'honie again. -''* V
To the people of California such' a bill will appear
nothing more than a legislative josh; but they are
treating it. seriously in the East. The New York
Times notes: "There is a subtle touch of grim humor
in. the phraseology of the bill, which makes it optional
with the wronged, husband whether he or the Sheriff
shall administer the disciplinary castigation to the
virago under, correction. Thereis reason to fear that
the Sheriff, having no personal interest in the matter,
would discharge his duty in a more er less perfunctory
manner; whereas the husband of the 'person being
the wife of any man,' who has rendered himself amen
able to the penalty of the husband-beating misde
meanor/ would certainly apply the scourge with no
sparing hand, if, moved to apply h at all."
According to the reports that come to us the bill
provides that "if any person, being the wife of any
man, shall, by physical violence, abuse", maltreat or
beat her husband, she shall be deemed guilty, of a mis
demeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be pun
ished by being whipped at the whipping post with not
less than five and not more than, thirty lashes by the
Sheriff, or by her husband, at his election."
WHILE Mrs. Carrie Nation, exulting in the
security of her womanhood, is sweeping the
:^East w-ith a besom and raising something like
a riot in every town in the State, the legislators of
DeJaware have under consideration a bill which, if
enacted, will startle herworse than the sight of a gin
mill* in open working order next door to her own
house. The Delaware measure is nothing more nor
less than a proposition â¢ to equalize punishments in
that State and to treat vicious wives in the same" way
that vicious husbands are treated. % 'Â¦*
? A DELAWARE REFORM.
Angry citizens and saloon sympathizers of Kansas
threaten to tar and feather Mrs. Carrie Nation if she
continues to make her depredations. Perhaps the
lady might Â¦suggest that in keeping: with the traditions
of her sex she is accustomed to a somewhat less pain
ful use of. feathers. . . . ' .
BRYflN FOR 1904.
ALREADY the lines are being drawn for
Bryan's third nomination in 1904. His sup
porters in the House and Senate have their
orders, and the issue nhelters will soon be blazing.
Recently there were signs of revolt against Bryan
in the South, but they have, subsided.
This brief reappearance of the spirit of indepen
dence followed Mr. Cleveland's article in the Saturday
Evening Post. But Bryan's forces met it with such a
savage outburst of abuse that its expression grew
weaker and finally ceased. The last reference to it was
in the Dallas (Texas) News, which said:_ "Mr. Cleve
land is being roundly abused by papers which con
sider that no one has any right to talk on political
matters except Mr. Bryan and his disciples."
That expresses the situation " exactly. Bryan and
tiis disciples have the organization and the floor and
ir.tcnd'to hold it and force his nomination again, as
they have already forced it twice.
In his book. "The First Battle," Bryan tells how he
secured control of the party organization. As early
as 1805. he says, he had conferences with Senators
Stewart and Jones srith the view of organizing a non
partisnn free silver movement to coerce the Repub
lican and Democratic parties into declaring for free
silver at 16 to 1, and to arrange a joint bolt from both
parties in the event that both refused.. He says that
this plan proving impracticable he and those who
w ere with him in its formation and abandonment pro
ceeded to form a bimetallic league in ' thirty-five
State and Territories to '"capture" the Chicago con
vention and "to. secure the temporary organization
and control it at every step."
At the* time this was determined upon and carried
out the whole movement was secret. Its plans were
laid covertly, and many who co-operated with it were .
r.ot aware that they were being used as the tools of a
i-ccrct junta, a majority of whose members had never
bien Democrat?. On that junta the Democratic
States of Xe.v Jersey, New York and Connecticut had
no representatives, nor was the party in those States
iwcre cf the plot to capture its national convention..
It was a reorganizing movement gathered from
forces entirely outside the party. It was not a reform
movement from within.
Commenting upon it recently Mr. Perry Belmont
contrasts it with Bryan's recent declaration that:
"Reorganization is an internal remedy, and cannot be
applied externally." Those who are within the party
lines have a right to a voice in the making of the
platform, and aft entitled to make such change in the
organization or machinery of the party as they please,
but honesty and good faith require that any desired
change shall be openly proposed and fairly presented."
Thea why did r.ot'honesty and good faith require
the same courÂ«e on the part of Bryan and his junta
of conspirators in 1806? What Democrat, what Re
publican, in the country expected the lawless declara
tions of the Chicago platform, or that the convention
would make a new departure that condemned the
whole history of the party from its beginning?
In the light of Bryan's acts then and his professions
row it is plain that his views of what is fair and
honest, change with bis interests and change of po
sition. In 1895-96 he was on the outside and broke, in
disguised, masked and from ambush without previous
declaration of );is purpose or open proposition of his
intentions. Now he is inside and objects to being
hit unless he is served with formal notice of the blow
and the piece at which it is aimed.
It is for old-style Democrats to consider the situa
tion and say howlney like it ,
If Mr. Bryan were under contract to maintain a
situation that i< agreeable to Republicans he could
'not suit them better. Even their shortcomings will
not be believed when- he points them out, because he
has yelled "Wolf* so often when there was no wolf
that no attention is paid to him.
OUR CURRENT TOPICS CLUB.
ON Saturday The Call will begin the publication
of the series of papers announced under the
title, The Current Topics Club. The papers
are to take the place heretofore occupied in The Call
by the Home Circle Studies. They are designed tj
be equally as instructive and beneficial as the Home
Studies, and interesting to a larger circle of readers.
As the title of the series implies, they will deal with
matters of current, interest and will therefore be of
value to all who wish to keep posted on the events of
the time.
The series, with which the club begins deals with
"What the â¢Government Does for the People," and
on each successive Saturday there will be an article
treating of some important phase of that subject. The
Monday papers will treat of. "The Opportunity and
the Man"; those of Tuesday will describe "Colonial
Governments of .To-day â Their Strength and-Weak
ness"; on Wednesdays there will 'be a course of ar
ticles on "The Women's Club movementâ 'What It 1 3
Doing"; the papers of Thursday will treat of "The
Art of Living a Hundred Years,", and on Fridays
there will be a series of descriptive articles on "Ameri-
can Life a Century Ago."
Â¦â¢ The spring term of the club, which begins on Sat
urday, will continue for four months. While eacli
paper will be complete in itself, it will nevertheless
be more valuable and more interesting when taken in
connection with others of the series to which it be
longs, and consequently it is advisable for all persons
to start the course with the first number. AH'there
fore who intend to take the courses of reading pro
vided by the Current Topics Club should be sure lo
begin with that which appears on Saturday. __ ..
: WÂ« remind our readers once more that each of the
various series is under the editorship "of- an authority
of high rank in the different lines of work taken up",
and each separate paper is to be prepared by a person
well qualified to treat of the subject. The course as
a whole will constitute a valuable addition to family
reading and will prove of great assistance in under
standing some of the most important factors involved
in the problems of the 6dy.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
- - A i UHCO. *
â¢ L.. F. Graham, a member of the executive committee of the Cured Fruit
Association of California, makes statements concerning the situation, of the
prune growers of the State which are certain to attract wide attention.' He
says that the prune production of the State irfthe year just closed was about
twice the maximum demand of the United States in former yeai-3. As a con
sequence there is still on hand in the State a bulk of prunes amounting; ap
proximately, to 100,000,000 pounds, worth something like J2.500.000. A. grave
problem now before the Cured Fruit Association is how to market these
prunes. . " '
Manifestly, says Mr. Graham, there are but two ways to proceed in Cali
fornia in the future in reference to prunes. The first, which no doubt in
expedient, 13 to reduce the production. The other way, which Is the one that
commends Itself to the judgment of the executive committee of the Cured
Fruit Association, is to Increase the demand sufficiently to make a market
for all the prunes that California produces.
The market has absorbed the maximum of â¢ previous years already. It
will not" take the remainder of the crop now In California unless means ace
adopted to bring that about. Having indicated the seriousness of the situa
tion, Mr. Graham remarks that the executive committee is helpless, man
acled, unable to effect any great measure of relief under existing conditions.
He explains that money Is needed to gain the confidence of the Eastern
jobbers and their salesmen and the retailers and the ability of the market to
take more prunes. But, unfortunately, the executive committee cannot
spend a penny for advertising or In promoting the marketing of the crop. It
faces the fact that there Is a huge .bulk of prunes on hand, In which there Is
a large amount 6f money tied up, and. still remains helpless unless the mem
bers of the association find a way to p rovide the funds necessary for the
proper wprk in the East. It is manifestly unwise, so Mr. Graham thinks, to
cut the price and load up the Eastern market at low rates to the detriment
of the price for the next crop.. The Eastern dealer, naturally, is inclined
to take advantage of the necessity of California, producers to beat down the
price to a. point where the grower would meet with loss.
Having made this statement, Mr. Graham says that there is a way for the
association to provide the funds that are needed so badly. In fact, a meeting
of the Cured Fruit Association has been called and will take place in Saji
Jose on Thursday, February 21, the purpose of which is to consider an amend
ment of the. by-laws. An amendment has been drawn by an attorney and
this Is -now under discussion among the members of the association. This
does not enlarge the powers of the executive committee to borrow, but en
ables the committee to use money for the pressing and immediate needs of
the association to the amount necessary from, a fund which the committee
was originally authorized to raise by borrowing for the purpose of erecting
warehouses. The authorization to borrow extended to $200,000. The amend
ment does not Imply that the executive committee proposes to use $200,000 in
advertising and promotion, but only what is indispensable for the purpose in
view. Â¦ â¢ " ' ; ;.. ;"',".:Â¦ Â¦ y i Â¦Â¦ Â¦'- ~ Â¦'*Â¦
Mr. Graham says that he makes these explanations because there would
seem to be some misunderstanding in some quarters. To the meeting of the
21st lnst., therefore, the prune growers and their committee are looking for
ward with' much interest, as the property values at stake, both present and
prospective, are very large. Â¦ '"? â¢-

To have gone into the facts that are known tcrMr. Biggy and others would have
demonstrated why the charter made the Mayor an autocrat. It wouldhave revealed revo
lution of city government by conspiracy, to put*- in the Mayor's hands the power to
milk Chinatown into the Examiner's bucket. And it: would have shown that Phelan quit
trying to keep the compact only from compulsion and not from choice.
After detailing the extremes to which the Mayor went to keep his compact, Mr.
Biggy said: "When he threatened me beyond the limit of endurance I said to him:
'Mayor Phelan, if you insist upon the election of Esola as Chief of PoliceTthe people of
San Francisco will do everything to you except spit upon you in the streets, and if I
agree to do as you demand of me they will spit upon me. Every reputable interest iii the
city is opposed to this plot. It is a diabolical scheme, to milk the town.' "
That is what the committee'did not want to know about. That is the subject they let
the Mayor uncover and the Examiner cover up again. â¢â¢-...-"
So this witness, who knew the facts and in whose honor and truthfulness the whole
State places implicit confidence, was refused permission to traverse the Mayor's testimony,
and the committee flinched at its most important duty and fled from the scene of its
cowardly display of incompetence and subserviency.
After he left the stand Mr. Biggy said: "I wanted to prove to this committee that
Mayor Phelan .attempted to sell the Police Department of this city to the managing ed
itor of the Examiner, and when he swore he did not he committed perjury. I wanted to
prove that the chief executive of -San Francisco and the Examiner entered into a corrupt
bargain to use the police power of- -the city as an engine for private profit, and that in
this whole disgraceful, shameful affair Mayor Phelan has. been a liar o*ff the stand and a
perjurer on it." â¢ ' . . .."
It will be seen that the plan was copied from Tammany methods. It became im
portant to know what compact the Mayor had with the Examiner and to what lengths he
went to keep it. There is one man who knows, and he is an honorable man. That man is
ex-Commissioner" and ex-Chief Biggy. He was a witness, but before his testimony was
taken this committee went into secret session with the Examiner representative and
agreed to prevent his testimony over the ground that Mayor Phelan had been permitted to
cover!
It will be seen that it was competent for the committee to traverse these statements
by the testimony of other witnesses. The Mayor's admissions demonstrated that the
great danger to police fidelity is not bribery in Chinatown, which may corrupt a few offi
cers of one squad, but the organization of the whole force as a blackmail machine to wink
at wickedness that pays, and backed by a subservient judiciary that will drive non-paying
vice out of town to increase the profits of the other kind.
Now there the whole subject was, opened by the 'committee. The Mayor said, under
oatli, that the "understanding" caused the Examiner to demand control of the Police and
Fire departments and also of the, judiciary of the cityf The first two it expected to
secure through the one-man power given to the Mayor in the charter; the last by his in
fluence in the party, conventions! And he would have consented" had. it not been for the
pressure brought to bear by the other papers! .
This issue is the most serious to which legislative attention can be directed. It far
transcends, any inquiry into the existence of vice in Chinatown. That fact is as 'well
known as the existence of Chinatown. Gambling, lottery, slavery, ar^allthere, mingled
indistinguishably in the malign pus of Asiatic life, planted' as ah exotic in a Western com
munity. An expression of surprise that they exist is an affectation. That they will pay
in heavy blackmail to officials for the privilege and profits of existence is equally well
known. In that these Asiatic vices are not alone. . â¢ ',--Â¦ ' Â¦
But the issue is, Who wanted to control the police force in order to be the tax-gath
erer on Chinese vice? ;
The committee considered this inquiry to be within its jurisdiction. When Mayor
Phelan was on the stand it permitted him to go into it at length. Pity it is that the frank'
ness of his statement was not equal to its length. â¢â¢ .-;â¢ ';
He admitted that the Examiner expected a substantial reward for its support of him
*by abusing everybody opposed to him. He admitted that he gave that paper a mortgage
upon himself when he entered politics, and that foreclosure was not attempted until the
ne\v charter was adopted. He admitted that he was expected to turn the Police Depart
ment over to the Examiner, and that he would have done so but for the opposition of the
other newspapers. But he denied that there was a "compact" to that effect, but admitted
that there was an "understanding-."
' Germane to the subject over which the committee had jurisdiction was the whole
subject of the political and newspaper influences which under the new charter may control
the police establishment of the city. Leading through that goes the proper inquiry as to
what use may be made of the force to bring profit to papers or power to politicians. The
issue raised is the whole question of a police force," independent and burdened by no obli
gation except its duty to the people, and with every man "in its ranks sure of his tenure as
long as that duty is discharged; or of. a force used as trading stock in politics, with its
control, given over to a newspaper manager to j^e used by him for offense and defense and
for his own profit wrung out' of the loss it may threaten others.
IHE legislative investigation of the police relations to the Chinese in this city came
to a close just at the edge of reliable revelations which would prove that the real
yellow peril of the city is the danger of a partnership between political ambition
and yellow journalism. .. â¢ /
Â¦ The investigations so far carried on by this Legislature have done it small credit,
but this promises to reflect upon it, through 'its. committee, positive- discredit. . *

The Great Postal Fraud.
Business men who seek better postal
facilities through a cheaper letter rate,
quicker deliveries, parcels malls, pneu
matic tube, service, an . enlarged distrib
uting plant or any of the betterments In
which our system is so conspicuously
lacking, ought to understand that they
will not get them by mere petitions to
CongTess. . They can get them only by
fighting the publishers*, ring, which throt
tles Congress. The crippling of the serv
ice In all departments, which causes It to
limp further and further behind in . the
international race, is due simply to the
second class mall fraud. Congress dares
not add to the existing deficiency annual
ly created by the carrying of book, peri
odical and advertising circular freight as
"mail." Consequently It abandons penny
letter postage, the parcels mail and tha
pneumatic tube system. So also it la
doubtful if it will extend the rural free
delivery system. Thus It keeps our serv
ice far behind that of Great Britain and
Germany at the behest of a number of
business concerns which, have combined
to make the Government bear tho freight
and express charges which other business
concerns bear for themselves. If the
merchants and manufacturers who want
new postofflce' buildings and an increased,
celerity in the handling of the mail la thÂ«
old ones will take the second class mail
frauds by the throat and shake the Gov
ernment's misappropriated revenues out
of their garments they will get what they
want in one session of Congress. The
Postmaster General's and Postofflce Com
mittee reports have demonstrated this
over and over again. But by mere peti
tion they will get nothing 1 , for there Is
not enough to go round. And they will

| H. B. Patterson Finds His Helpmeet
Too Humble to Enjoy His In

Suit has been instituted by Lettle Pat
terson against H. R. Patterson, the well
known shipping agent, for maintenance.
In her complaint she alleges that she'waa
married to Patterson at Berkeley â¢ on
Christmas eve, 1837. and that lftlDecem
ber last he deserted her in the hope that
she would bring suit for a divorce. His
indifference toward her. it is alleged, did

and then he began to find fault with tho
humble origin of his wife. The suit is to
recover alimony to tho amount of $150 a
month for the support of herselX and
child, a girl two years of age.

wife's claims. It was alleged' that ho

The investigation into the values of the
Spring Valley Water Works last night by
the Board of Supervisors developed the
important fact that, in spite. of the reduc
tion made in the water rates in successive
years, tho revenue of the company has
not sensibly diminished, talcing into con
sideration the increase in- the number of
consumers. Chief Engineer Schussler was
on the stand during the entire session in
an endeavor to justify his' high estimate
of the actual value of the plant which
he has placed at $40,231,750. Schussler was
closely questioned by Supervisor Reed,
who acted as chief inquisitor in an en
deavor to have him reduce his estimates,
but Schussler would not be shaken anfl
clung tenaciously to his figures, which he
said had been based on reports of ex
perts.
Reed read excerpts from the statements
filed by the company regarding'thelr reve
nue. He contended that the supposed re
duction effected 'in last year's rate which
the company -had placed at $150,000 less*
than the previous year did not exist, but
that in reality there was an increase of
about $400. Reed then read the revenues
for the last ten years, which showed that
in spite of the reduction made year by
year the mean revenue remains practic
ally the same. In 1890-91 the revenue was
$1,573,93010: 1891-2. $1,657.755 57: 1892-3, $1.
fe73.f.2O28: 2S33-4 $1,670.793 08; '1894-5, $1,6S3,
602 JO; 1895-6. ?l,750,874 85; 1896-7, $1,805,
285 59; 1S97-8.$1.',O1,8O3 19; 1SS8-9. $1,875,082 37;
1S99-1.W0, $1,950,286 88; 1900-01. $1,875,49U 56.
Reed held that Schussler had no
right to "include ln.his estimate the cost
of water rights yet to be acquired, and
no right to include in his estimate the cost
of waret rights yet to be acquired, and
that BUch' items would reduce Schussler's
estimate by $4,tt)0,000. The item of $25)3,
000 to furnish riparian owners with water
from Niles Creek Schussler explained by
saying that the figures represented what
the company would get for the water if
it were sold to consumers. Reed held that
the company hÂ«id no right to charge for
something which was owned by other par
ties. . .
Reed drew attentldn to the discrepancy
in Schussler's estimate and that of Sec
retary Ames, -who had figured. it at $26.
245,095 66. When Schussler reiterated his
statement that the actual cost of the
plant was greater than the par value of
the stocks ami bonds Reed pointed tri
umphantly to the fact that the latter are
worth $26,750,000, or $400,000 more than
Ames' estimate. Schussler said there was
no discrepancy, as" he had arrived Â«.t his
conclusions by different methods. Ames
came to his rescue by saying that He
might have skipped some things. Re
ferring to the item of .';950 acres of reser
voir sites at $1500 an acre, Schussler said
that the high valuation was due to the
land being specially adapted- for reservoir
sites and the property had increased ln
value singe 18S?. when tt was first bought.

NOW A BENEDICT
The first emigrant train that left Chi
cago last Tuesday, filled with prospective
settlers for California, should arrive in
San Francisco this afternoon. Word was
received yesterday in the railroad build
ing from the different Eastern' railroads
stating the number of cars . filled with
emigrants they bad turned over at Ogden.
This will be the first excursion of its
kind ever Undertaken by the Southern
Pacific and it is a direct sign of President
Hays" progressiveneps. This emigrant
travel has not yet been thoroughly adver
tised in the East, yet the first excursion
Is a great success.
The Denver and* Rio Grande official*
wired the Southern Pacific Company yes
terday that they had twelve cars filled,
with emigrants traveling to San Fran
cisco. With the big showing that' the Rio
Grande makes on the first day it is ex
pected that this emigrant travel to the
coast will be enormous before the end of
Tâ¢e Southern Pacific Company will this
month circulate throughout the Eastern
States an enormous quantity of literature
in reference to the products of California.
The books will be sent out in different
series and each volume will contain a de
scription of a different county ln Califor
nia, The books are beautifully printed
and are profusely illustrated with half
tone pictures. . Â¦ â¢ '
President Hays, though still in New
York, is in constant communication with
the officers of the Southern Pacific. Tele
g'ams are received nearly every hour in
the day. Hays is not expected back for
over two weeks.-' H. E, Huntington is
also ln New York. He is expected to re
turn to the coast in about a month.
General Passenger Traffic Manager E.
O. McCormick. accompanied by his secre
tary, George Gardiner, left last evening
for Chicago. " McCortnick goes East as
the representative of the Southern .Pacific
at the meeting of the Transcontinental
Passenger Traffic Managers. The session
will open Tuesday. On that day the Ep
worth League business will be discussed
and on the following day arrangements
will be made for the transportation of dis
; charged soldiers.

EMIGRANTS NEAR
CALIFORNIA LINE
If the various BoarSs of Trade of Cali
fornia would manifest the same energy
in exploiting the resources of California
with the world at large as shown by
some of the Eastern railways there would
toon be a marked increase ln immigration
and tourist travel to the coast would be
largely augmented. Mr. George H. Dan
iels, general passenger agent of the New
York Central and Hudson River Railroad
Company, has shown an interest in Cali
fornia by advertising our resources in
Eastern magazines and papers and other
wise wherever the advertising folders of
the company are sent. . These are to be
found in every leading hotel and every
railway station in the United States and
Canada and at many of the- leading rail
way stations in Great Britain and the
Continent.
Because of the generous praise accorded
California and her institutions and the
wide distribution this class of publicity
cannot fail to be of inestimable value.
Excerpts from the 40-page illustrated
catalogue issued by the N. Y. C and li
lt. R. R. Co. make interesting reading and
show what an enterprising advertising
department connected with an Eastern
railway is doing for California.
Of the State at large the booklet says:
"A laxid of fruits ajid liowers." Califor
nia aftords every variety of scenery and
climate; abounds la mountains, lakes, riv
crs and forests. Every American should
know something aU>ut it. The air is pure
Â«m*}d bracing, and the sun shines most all
the lime. No January ice. February
snows, or bleak March winds. "A delight
from beginning to end."
For an Eastern pt-rton there Is nothing
quite so enjoyable as a winter on the Pa
cific Coast, that country being delightful
during the winter months from Southern
California to Seattle. "And the wllder
â¢ cess shall blossom as the rose."
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
Is a remarkable iHustration of the above
prophecy, and persons who have not eeen
it for a few years will be astonished at
its wonderful growth.
THE ROSES OF SANTA BARBARA.
Nowhere in the world are the. roses more
beautiful or more plentiful than at Santa
Barbcra in the winter. The winter aspect
fhowe roses ln place of snow, and the
wealth of roses and other flowers tells the
t-tory of the winter climate.
THE OLD MISSION AT SAJsTA. BAR
BARA.
To every lover of romance, to every ad
mirer of the Quaint architecture -of the
old California missions, to every person
interested ln the early- history of the
United States, a visit to this mission is
well worth the time and the cost of a trip
from New York or Boston.
THE DRIVE UP MOUNT HAMILTON
Is one of the most delightful mountain
drives in America. A famous astronomer
has said that from the top of Mount Ham
ilton, California, more of the earth's sur
face can be seen than from any other spot
in the world. You climb the mountain on
Â¦m. perfect grade and pa- c s beautiful gar
dens on the way.
THIS LICK OBSEEVATOnr.'
Most celebrated of all the American ob
servatories is the "Lick" on Mount Ham
ilton, California, which Is at once tho
tomb of and a monument to the public-
Fpiritednc-ss cf one of tlie most famous
pioneers of California. It can be. reached
in a little more than four days from New
York or Boston by the through trains of
the New York Central lines.
SEA BATHING ALL WINTER.
In Southern California one can bathe in
the Pacific Ocean every day, and yet the
air is bracing. Just the place for those
who don't feel well and want something
to brace them up.
THE EIGHTEEN-MILE DRIVE. .
Whoever has not taken this wonderful
<Srive frcm the Del Monte at Monterey,
CbL. has missed an experience that should
be enjoyed by every American and by
every foreigner who visits America. There
is nothing quite like it anywhere on the
earth.
MOUNT TAMALPAIS. CALIFORNIA.
The trip up Mount Tamalpais from San
Francisco can be made in ten hours, and
Is one of the most Interesting- short trips
on the Pacific Coast. From the top of
this great mountain San Rafael, San
Francipco and the bay lie at your feet.
A similar line of advertising has also
been scattered broadcast bv A. J. Smith
general pasFrnfcer agent of the Lake
Shore and Michigan Southern Railway,
tnd O. \\\ Ruggles of the Michigan South
ern.
The New York Central Railway system.
comprising over eleven thousand miles of
.mad east cf St. Louis and Chicago, Is onÂ©
iff the mon completely equipped railway
organizations In the world. Its trains are
the fastest, its representatives always
courteous and accommodating and its
management broad enough to see the
value of giving wide publicity to distant
localities, evr-n thouRh by po doing rival

CHICAGO, Feb. 14.â At any stage of the
speculative play In wheat it was extremely
difficult to discern the Impulses governing the
market. It was a nervous, hesitating. Irregu
lar. affair, generally dull, but ' full of unac
countable whims. The profundity of even the
experts was taxed to the limit, and their "ad-
Vice on tho . rroper manner of playing the
market" was oraculous and vague. The mar
ket yesterday advanced In the face of bearish
news; tc-day lt declined on advices "which en
the- surface looked emphatically- bullish
May opened a shade higher to a shade* lower
at 76c to TaTtc. and under the influences of
advances at Liverpool . and on the Continent
advanced early on a small trade to 76^Â£c. On
the- advance trade became very dull and a
little foreign selling added to. local liquidation
sent May off to 75*i4c. The corn strength later
frightened some wheat shorts. .xvhos<Â» covering
caused a rally to 76',ic. Longs, owing to the
nervous uncertain appearance of the market,
thought it advisable to secure profit. ' ' May
conrequently turned heavy and closed at "the
bottom, Kg under yesterday at 75%@75%c. Â¦
Corn was very full but dull up to noon. But
after that it 'became suddenly active and-ag-
Crefslvely stronz. . '
â¢ Oats were fairly active and flrmi May closed
He higher at 25HC. -
Provisions ruled firm, though rather dull and
narrow. . The demand, mostly for pork, was
started by the- strength of the hog market, and
the pace was maintained later with the assist
ance of tbe corn strength. May*pork closed 20<*
higher, lard 2%e higher and ribs 7V4C higher.
The leading futures* ranged as follows:

â¢â¢Jobbing interest in prunes continues very
good, but buyers are unwilling to pay the
prirep demanded.. A. feature yesterday was an
inquiry from a well-known wholesale and re
tail dealer for five " e*rs at extremely low
figure*. There was an unconfirmed report that
a sale of a car of 50-60s in Â£o-Tb boxes had been
msiie at 4^.

Following Is the latest mail report from New
Tork: "The cr.'.y new business In loose raisins
lÂ«Â«rr.ed of yesterday was the reported sale of
a car of 2-crown goods at IVsC this practically
cleaning up all goods offering at that quota

the fact was very evident that the urgent
pressure of speculative liquidation was re
laxed. The bears who sold yesterday covered
.their contracts In consequence. This prob
ably accounted In great part for the show of
firmness in the market. The bears have re
ceived too many severe lessons in the last few
months not to have become rather timid,
especially in the face of the possibilities con
stantly hinted at of further important finan
cial developments. In yesterday's decline
much was made of the fact that stocks gen
erally included In the interests of the promi
nent financier who has borne the most Import
ant part In the recent consolidations was uni
formly weak and this was alleged to be due
to the coming departure of this financier on
his annual vacation trip to Europe. - As
though In reply to these considerations the
Flocks thus Involved were "all supported to
day. Including Federal Steel, the Bries. the
Readings. Northern Pacific and National Tube.
The sharp recovery in the steel stocks served
ae an admonition to those 'who have counted
upon a break in the group. The announce
ment of the terms of the steel merger is be
lieved to be imminent, but the whole specu
lative world Is profoundly puzzled as to what
the terms win- be and the exact period when
they will be published. Wilh this develop
ment hanging over the market there was hesi
tation and more or less apathy in the trad
ing. There was no sign of resumption of the
heavy buying by banking interests which has
so often been in, evidence previous to the re
cent consolidations. General Eleetric was
conspicuous for an extreme advance of 16
points over last night, with a reaction of 3^.
The iocal tractions. Sugar and Tobacco were
conspicuously strong at times and North
American was forced up two points. Atchison
was lifted above 67. None of these gains were
fully held and the tone of the market was
rather heavy at the close and ; the volume of
dealings very materially curtailed.' Sterling
exchange was lower In spite of the continued
active demand for money in London.
There was less doing In railroad bonds and

unchanged at Â£71 5s for spot and" Â£71 16s 6d

less in a nominal condition, there being no
business to base quotations on, and the nomi
nal basis was $17 for Lake- Superior and
W 62!4 for casting and electrolytic at the
close. Lead was dull and unchanged at $4 3. Mi
end at London the market was weak and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, . Feb. 14.â Deputy
Constable Bunce to-day /brought Dr.
Frederick A. Remley from Santa Maria
to this city to be examined for his sanity.
He was discovered some days ago at hi3
hei milage, near Point Sal, under his bed
nude and in a deplorable state. For
about four years Remley has been living
near the old Point Sal chute landing en
tirely by himself, his nearest neighbor
being a Swiss dairyman. He chose the
place so that he could lead a purely vege
tarian life and treat himself for stomach
trouble. Of his past life little Is known
beyond the fact that he was graduated
from a German university and was highly
educated. At various times he has been
engaged to lecture and had the reputation
of being- a most able speaker, particularly
on German subjects.
He has a mania for making butter and
will eat nothing but milk. When not do
ing that he is praying and imagines him
self to be God. â¢ At Los Ollvos, where the
party stopped last night, he broke the
bedstead. to pieces and had to be tied
down. His relatives reside at Mason City,

MAY FIGHT IN DENVER.
General Assembly Repeals the Re-
cently Passed Law.
DENVER. Feb. '14.â The lower House of
the General Assembly to-day struck out
the enacting clause of the Senate bill to
repeal the Cannon prizefight bill passed
two years ago. As a result Manager
Floto of the Colorado Athletic Associa
tion will to-morrow submit an offer to
Jeffries and Ruhlln to come here and pull
off the big fight, which the decision of the
Ohio courts to-day caused to be â¢. post
poned indefinitely in Cincinnati, and which
probably could not be held In Ohio at all.
The failure of the act to repeal the prize
fight measure leaves the Colorado stature
in a chaotlq condition and it is not thought
that there would be any great obstacles
placed In the way of a plan to hold the
fight in Denver. The Cannon law repealed
the old statute which made prizefighting
a' felony and there is now no law against
prizefighting in this State, inasmuch a
a decision of the Arapahoe District Court
holding the Cannon law unconstitutional
has been appealed and is still pending.
The Police Commissioners of Denver are
openly, favorable to fighting, and it is said
the Governor would not interpose any
serious objection. Manager Floto Is con
sulting with the authorities to-night be
fore making a formal offer.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
OAKLAND, Feb. 14. â Charles
Twombly is one of the army of
the great unwashed. According
to his own confession Twombly
hasn't used soap for four weeks.
Twombly says, however, that it is not his
fault that he has gone uncleansed all this
time. He would have bathed If his land
lady would have let him.
It was Twombly's understanding: with
Margaret Brown, the cruel landlady be
fore mentioned, when he engaged the bay
window room of her house, 619 Nineteenth
street, that he was to have a bath once
a week. The water was to be hot and
there was to be a large bar of washing
soap on hand. Besides the bath It was
agreed that Twombly should have the
liberty of the laundry, use the home-made
washboard whenever he wanted It, and be
made more secure with two whole panes
of glass put in place of two broken ones.
, But according to Twombly. the land
lady did not stick to her agreement. For
some reaspn unknown to him she turned
the bathroom water off after he had been
a lodger for just a short time. Then she
gradually curtailed his privileges until the
run of the bouse was his no more and he
was denied the washboard for keeps. Four
weeks of this.
This recital is Twombly's in a cross
complaint and answer filed by him to-day
in the suit brought against him by the
landlady for the return of her room. He
characterized her as having acted "un
lawfully, willfully and maliciously, and
with the purpose and aim of causing de
fendant herein harm, detriment and dam
ape." For damages Twomblv wants $25
for the water he didn't get, $5 for being
denied the society of the washboard and
$50 for sickness caused by unrepaired win
dows.
SLIGHTED WOMAJff PLANS
A TERRIBLE REVENGE
Causes a Physician's Stove to Be
Filled With Explosive Because
of a Quarrel.
DAYTON, O.. Feb. 14.â It is alleged
-three young women claim the affection of
Dr. W. It. Scott. Ha had a misunder
standing with one of the women and it is
said, to be revenged, she caused the doc
tor's office to be robbed of $300 worth of
instruments and caused the furnltunj
operating chairs to be ruined. The doc
tor's stove was filled with a powerful ex
plosive, so that when he returned from
visiting his patients and undertook to light
his gas fire he would be blown to atoms.
parents or guardians. The number oC
children in the home now is 115.
The rule is that children are not to be
retained at the home after they attain
the age of 14 years. It may be necessary
to retain them for a short time after thsy
reach that age, however, in order to settla
, them in a congenial place, but generally
.that Is done before the time limit has been
reached. Up to the age of 14 years tha
children are supported by the State, sums
I being paid to the home as follows out of
the State treasury: Full orphans, $50 for
each six months; half-orphans, $37 for
each six months; foundlings, $73 for each,
six months until the children are eight
een months of age, when they aro rated
and paid for as full orphans.
The last year the management pur
chased a lot 66x190 feet at 1666 Ninth street
and on it erected at a cost of $3000 a ba
bies' home cf eight rooms, in which
twenty-five Infants are sheltered. Very
little money is received from the parents
and guardians of the inmates, so that tho
expense of the Institution Is borne la thÂ»
main by the State, though a number of
donations, generally small, are received
during the year.
The most liberal allowance of this kind
is $125 per month from the Mary A. Crock
er trust. The home has fifteen attaches,
all of whom are paid practical salaries.
The coming year will witness the making
of a number of changes in tho main build
ing which Â¦will increase tha capacity and
comfort of that institution.
The total of receipts jtor the eighteen
months in question reached (22X9 37 and
the expenditures during that timer reached
$18.2S5 68. not including tha $3000 for tha
babies' home.
This home Is one of the most deserving
of the eleemosynary institutions of this
city, a fact which Is all the more to its
credit because it is practically under the
exclusive management of ladies who are
also engrossed with the cares of home
life.
At the last general meeting the reports
of the officers were read, and showed that
the home was In a most satisfactory con
dition. Improvements have been made,
all expenses have been met and there was
an outline decided upon of other improve
ments which will bo carried out during
the present fiscal year. This is a show
ing which is gratifying to the friends of
the institution and to those who have the
Interest of dependent little ones at heart.
The reports In question covered a period
of eighteen months, for the reason that

OAKLAND. Feb. 14.â The officers
of the West Oakland Home for
Orphans, Half Orphans and Des
titute Children have been elected
for the ensuing year as follows:
The report of the recording secretary.
Mrs. J. A. Campbell, bristled with inter
esting information. From it are taken
facts of general interest. The number of
children on* the roll at the end of the pre
ceding fiscal year was IIS. Since then dur
ing a period of eighteen months there
were enrolled . seventy-one ' additional,
making a total of 1S9. During the time
specified four 'little ones passed away;
seven were provided with homes, and
eight were adopted by people who
mourned the fact that they had no chil
dren of Ijheir own. Children are sent out
on trial with a view toward adoption in
the event of their showing contentment
with their surroundings and arousing a
parental love in those to whom they are
temporarily intrusted. This probationary
period extends through three months. If
at the end of that time the orphan boy
or girl Is not satisfied with his or her
would-be foster parents, or the latter are
dissatisfied with the boy or girl, the pa
rentless Jlttle one is returned to the home
to await a more auspicious opportunity.
During the last eighteen months fifty
four children have been reclaimed by their
held the date of the annual meeting to
follow -was changed from the last Mon
day in June to the first Monday In Feb
ruary. This change was made so as to
avoid the dissatisfaction of holding an
important meeting in the summer, when
so many of the members and even officers
were away from home seeking recreation
in the mountains and on the seashore.
The change has worked in a most satis
factory manner, because the attendance
at the last meeting in point of numbers
was all that could have been desired.

RJSVVS OF OVERDUE FLEET.
One Vessel Posted as Missing, An
other Heard. From.
The schooner Fred E. Sanders arrived.
at Seattle from San Pedro last night and
reported having spoken the German bark
Otto Gildermeister on Januarly 30 in lati
tude 33 27 north, longitude 127 west.' The
Gildermeister 'was partially dismasted and
was apparently heading for San Fran
cisco. The vessel is now out ninety-two
da^ys from Yokohama for Portland, and 90
per cent has been offered for several days
to reinsure her, chances. When she was
seen by the Sanders she was making slow
headway. â¢ ' * "
The speaking of the Otto Gildermeister
may give a fillip to the rest of the long
overdues. The Cape Wrath is now out
105 days from Callao for Portland, and the
Andrada 95 days from Santa Rosalia- for
Portland, and S<0 per cent has in. vain been'
offered by the underwriters' on their'
chances. The British ship Yarana, from
Santa Rosalia for Iquique, has been post
ed.as missing at Lloyds' and the Andra
murcheji, 73 days out from the Fraser
River for Liverpool, has been practically
given up for lost. . â¢
The schooner Webfoot, which arrived
yesterday from Grays Harbor, reports
sighting a derelict, bottom up, twenty
five miles off Tillamook Light. The bot
tom was painted red and the hull white
This is probably the remains of the
schooner Joseph and Henry, which was
wrecked during .the recent gales. The
hull drifted* inshore and was recognized
and then drifted out to sea again The
description given' by the captain of the
Wcbfoot tallies with the Joseph and

The attorneys representing Bacigalupi
feel equally confident that the deed
given their client by the Italian Consul
will hold in law. When informed that
Judge Troutt said that $25,000 had been of
fered for the land, Attorney Lamberson
of Visalia lauphed and replied: "I am not
surprised at that. There are people who
would now offer $100,000 for the property
but that doesn't Injure our titla in any
way. The Italian Consul holds the power
of attorney from the heirs and when he
sold to us that settled the transaction."
"If the appraisers are appointed at that
time." said Ruef, "I will ask that the
Bacigalupl hearing be postponed until
after they report. If the; Baeigalupi pe
tition for final distribution of the estate
to him is heard first, the. heirs will be
shut out from what little chance they
have of securing their rights." . . -
Judge Troutt stated at recess time that
the first intimation he had that the land
was so valuable was when he was asked
on Monday last to set aside the order of
confirmation of sale to Bohls. "I have
since been informed." said he. "that there
are people who are now willing to pay
$25,000 for the property." . * .
"We intend standing on our rights,"
said. Attorney Gunzendorfer, who
represents Bohls. <c We were the highest
bidders and the land was sold to us. We
have turned over the amount of the pur
chase price to Mr. Drinkhouse and we ex
pect the deed. The fact that Judge Troutt
has set aside the order confirming the sale
does not disturb us in the least We
know of no law granting him such power.
If it is necessary we will appeal from that
ruling to the Supreme Court. We feel
entirely safe In our position and It would
not bother us if the land was reappraised
and valued at a million dollars. We
bought it in good faith, have complied
with the law and intend getting posses
sion."
Judpe Troutt declined to. entertain the
motion at that time, but instructed Ruef
to notify all* interested counsel to be in
court at 10 o'clock this morning; when' he
would listen to arguments. . ' r
Attorney Ruef again pleaded for the ap
pointment of the appraisers and said:
"Appoint a set of appraisers who under
stand oil landâ take the State Mineralo
gist, for Instanceâ and they will be able to
make a- report by Tuesday. I .will pay
their expenses."
I do not care to act until the attorneys
of all the interested parties are present,"
replied Judge Troutt. "There is some
thing amiss. I understand that the prop
erty is very valuable."
"Appoint the appraisers to-day," urged
Ruef, "and I will pay their expenses. 1
want to get at the bottom of this matter.
I am anxious to see that the heirs pet
their rights and that the land brings the
highest possible price."
"I am in doubt," replied the Judge, "as
to whether this court has any power to
act In that matter. If the Italian Consul
has, as attorney for the heirs, sold the
property to Bacigalupl, I do not think wo
can go back of the'record unless fraud is
shown or it is proved that the heirs acted
under a misapprehension. If the Consul
or the heirs should come forward and ask
to have the sale set aside matters would
be simplified. It now looks as if the heirs
have virtually thrown themselves out of
court."
"I am anxious to have this matter dis
posed of as speedily as possible," said
Ruef, "and so Is- Mr. Drinkhouse. We
want to protect' the Interests of the heirs.
We are satisfied that if bids are again
invited we will receive a much higher bid
than that .of Bohls, to whom we sold
the land, but who has not yet received a
deed, as your Honor has set aside the
order of confirmation of sale."
Small Hope That They Will Ever Recover
the Amount of Which They Practically
Have Been Cheated.
Ruef afked that the appraisers be at
once- appointed and that his client be au
thorized to expend a reasonable amount
of the funds of the estate in apaln adver
tising the property for sale. He further
affced that bids be received In open court
next Tuesday and arted upon before the
hearing cf the petition of Theodore Baci
pralupt. who claims the property by virtue
of a deed piven him for JW) by the Italian
Consul, who holds the power of attorney
for the heirs living in Italy.
If Mid land ir petroleum-bearing your peti
tioner declares there is reasonable ground for
believing that It may be of much greater
value than the amount of any of the bids
yet presented or FURp^sted.
Your petitioner is not advised that men is
the fact and lias npt received any informa
tion from any of the bidders or persons claim
ing to he Intending bidders that sucii is the
fact, the mof L favorable- fUKSeetion In that
behalf .heretofore made to him being that
there was a possibility that euch might turn
out to be the fact.
Your petitioner Is inclined to belle\-e. al
though ho has. not been able to verify the
t*.n, that petroleum l:as Just been discovered
In paying quantity In the vicinity of Bald lands
Â«.nd thai there Is great likelihood that said
land Is oll-bearlng land.
From fuclt investigation your petitioner and
his attorney are Inclined to believe that the
sÂ«Jd interest, now evinced, is due to the ln
crean^d likrirhood of said land b*lny oil-bear
ing .territory. Your petitioner In hlÂ« petition
for E*Je of e&ld property filed herein oa No
vember IT, 1900, hazarded the suggestion that
paid land "is chieCy valuable for the possibil
ity that It may contain petroleum," %lthouÂ«h
be had nothing but surmise on which to base

Attorney A. Ruef . representing ex-Pub
lic Administrator Drinkhouse, who sold
the valuable oil land of the estate sit
uated In Kern County to Henry Bohls for
52000. appeared before Judge Troutt yes
terday a#d asked that all further proceed
ings be stayed until after three expert ap
praisers, familiar with oil lands, .view
the land and reappraise the property. In
support of the motion he recited the story
of how Drinkheuse came to advertise the
property for sale and then tiled a peti
tion signed by Drinkhouse. setting forth
how his suspicions had been aroused by
the sudden and marked interest taken in
the property after It had been sold by
persons who had not bid for it or com
municated their intention to do so. An
Investigation was made -by Drinkhouse
with the result told in the following con
cluding paragraphs of the petition:
The heirs of Giovanni Cuoco have been
swindled out of several hundred thousand
dollars' worth of property and there Is
but flight chance of them ever secur
ing re-dress. The estate, which is
now estimated to be worth close on to
5Ctw.C>C>0, has been bartered away for a. trifle.
The people who should have guarded the
Interests of the heirs were either hypno
tized or criminally negligent. They did
not make the slightest effort to prevent
the carrying out of the gigantic robbery
until It was too "late to act. It Is true
that the alleged steal was perpetrated un
der the guise of the law. but the fact still
remains that the relatives of Cuoco have
been robbed of their heritage. The opin
ion of attorneys v.ho read the story of the
robbery in The Call yesterday is that the
heirs are shut off from ail possibility of
ever securing what they are lawfully en-*
titled to. Judge Troutt, before whom the
probate proceedings are pending, will
commence an Investigation Into the mat
ter this morning and has cited all of the
interested parties to appear before Ulm.
He is commencing the Investigation with
but email hope of being able to right the
wrong done.

made a succesful dash for liberty.
The robbery/ considering the value of
the stolen property- and the daring and
successful manner in which it was exe
cuted, has caused considerable excitement
in railroad circles. .-Where the suspects
boarded rhe train and how they succeed
ed In gaining entrance into the sleeper is
a mystery. Their knowledge of the apart
ments of the car supports the belief that
the negr,o had been a porter.
F. H- Osgood, his wife, their attorney,
W. A. Peters, . and a party of ' friends
were on their way to. Southern California
on a pleasure trip. They give the fol
lowing account of the robbery and subse
quent search:
Mrs. ORKood was sleeping in a berth direct
ly under her husband's. She woke in the
early morning and immediately "reached for
her Jewels, which ehe always placed for the
night while .traveling In a small has tied about
her neck with a piece of tape. When she
found the Jewels .were not In. the accustomed
place, she searched tho berth, thinking that
they might have become detached during the
night. During- her search she looked out into
the car. and saw two men 'walking down the
aisle. Their presence, even at that early hour,
did not arouse her suspicions.
After having completely searched her berth
without result, Ehe aroused her. husband, who
went for the conductor. A thorough search of
the- car wa"s made. They discovered a white
youth 'hiding In a closet In the men's dressing;
room. Ho was searched, , but nothing that
could connect him in any way with the crime
was found on his person. ". .
Mrs. Osgood had arisen in the meantime and
went to the. ladles', dressing; '.room. In the
dressing apartment she found that a door to
the closet In which a portion of her clothing
was hanging was secured from the inside. Rhe
started to go for a porter, but no sooner had
she turned around than a negro darted from
tho closet and ran out of -the car, making his
escape. Before the conductor and Osgood had
been notified of the presence of the negro, the
train had stopped at a small station. In all
probability the negro took advantage of the
stop to escape. . -
He undoubtedly is the thief. He is de-

SACRAMENTO. Feb. 14.â Lawrence V.
Hill, who was taken into custody on sus
picion of complicity in the theft, told De
tective Ahem of the railroad .company
that he got on the train at Lincoln and
wanted to reach Santa Ana, where he has
an uncle. He said ho had got on the train
by mistake. . .
Soon after she appeared at Capt&In Sey
mour's office the man who had attended the
woman on the ferry and at the 'bus made his
appearance at police headquarters. How he
learned of the woman's detention I don't know,
unless he went Immediately to the Russ House
after he had registered at the Palace and was
Informed of the woman's having been taken
away by. Detective Egnn. . "
I was afterward Informed when Esran told
the woman he wished to speak to her that she
objected on the ground that she wanted to go
to the toilet. Bgan â¢ then became suspicious
and Informed her that she would have to ac
company him to see Captain Seymour. Egan
took her to the captain's office and the cap
tain thought the circumstances warranted him
In ordering the woman to be searched. The
woman again expressed a desire to be allowed
to bo to the toilet. She was turned over to
the matron and searched, whether before oc
after going to the toilet I don't know.- After
the search it was announced that no Jewelry
answering to the description of that missing
had been found on her person. The woman
was dlschareed from custody because there
was no evidence against her.
Ellis and myself went to the Russ Hcfuse
and ascertained that the woman. had not reg
istered, but had been taken away by De
'tecllve Egan. who Jiad- by means of 'a etreet
car arrived there before her.
Ellis and myself went to the Palace Hotel
and eot a' full description of the stolen Jewels
from Mr. Osgood. Â¦ The man who had attended
the suspected woman was registered at .the
Palace.
I asked Mr. Ostrood if he suspected any
other person than the negro and the white lad
in the train of having â¢committed the robbery,
and he cald he suspected a woman who occu
pied the lower berth of section 7 opposite that
of section 6. the lower berth of which was
occupied by Osgrood and his wife. The woman
under suspicion was about 25 * years of age
and was attractively dressed.
On ' leaving the train at the Oakland mole
the suspected woman was joined by a man
from Port . Townsend who had occupied the
u'nper berth of section 7. He left her on the
upper deck of the ferry and went below. On
the San- Francisco side he rejoined the woman
and placed her on the Rubs House 'bus. At
the ferry depot I met Detectives Egan and
Ellis of San Francisco and told them of the
robbery and the woman suspected. Kgan sal>i
he would, follow the woman and find out what
room ehe was assigned to. .
The missing Jewels include: One opal
set in twenty-five or thirty diamonds, sim

with Cingalese netting.

All that was secured from the store by
Green's confederate was a box of tele
phone checks. These were -taken as Ver
cevich marched out from behind the bar
at the point of Green-'s pistol. The rattle
of the brass checks makes Vercevich In
cline to the belief that the second robber
thought he had struck the. till.
Young Svenltch, the student, who was
early on the -scene, now says that before
going into, the store he saw one man pass
a number of cartridges to another and
now thinks that the man that -received
them was Green. He paid but little at
tention to the matter at that time and
can give no clear description of the men
that he passed.
Green has been charged by v ercevlch,

The -Police Department; has come to the
conclusion that Green iÂ» one of the same
gang that last October held up a man in
front of his residence on Turk street, be

Green, the wounded robber, lies on a.cct
In the Receiving Hospital. He Is con
stantly watched by the police officer*,
and, as a result of his painful wound. Is
surly and morose. Of his antecedents he
will not speak. He has all the manners
of a hardened criminal, though apparent
ly young in years. r; " M
It has been ascertained that before com
mitting the deed Green purchased a new
outfit of clothing from Edward Harris, 628
Kearny street. Harris, and one. of Ws
salesmen Identified the property at the
office of the Chief of Police.
Detectives Reynolds, Thomas, Gibson
and Bally, who have been working, on the
case In an endeavor to ascertain the
man's identity,, are awaiting information
from the military authorities. Several of
ficers charged specially with the duty of
looking for deserters and escaped prison
ers have -seen the man and will endeavor
to ascertain for the benefit of the police
whether or not he was a member of the
army. The only connection so far estab
lished is that he wore a. blue shirt similar
to those worn by soldiers. Â¦
Harry Harrington, who, was driving the
mail wagon that wag held up at the cor
ner of "Washington and Front streets ear
lier in the evening, was- taken to see Green
at the Receiving Hospital. He â¢ thought
he resembled the man who held him up,
but would not positively identify him.
George C. Farrell, a grocer, who was
also held up by three men.-is positive that
the prisoner Green is one of the same
gang. His description furnished the po
lfce before seeing the man Is similar to
that of the man In custody.

where the demijohn stood also shows
that there was â¢ a battle. Across the
street diagonally the windows and the
glassware in the grocery store and the
lamppost show where some of the bul
lets landed.
After describing in detail his struggle
with his assailant, Vercevich said:
"First It was one of us up and then
the other. We rolled around, fighting for
possession of the pistol. When I got
ft away the fellow started to- run, I
fired the four shot left In the pistol at
him. He ran. diagonally across the street.
One ball Â¦ struck the lamppost and two
others went through the windows of the
grocery store in the same corner. It was
the last shot that caugrht the fellow. I
think. I do not know whether he yelled
or not When he was struck. I kept my
eye upon him until he ran up the alley
and hid. Then Officer Sawyer came along
and found him." â¢ ' Â¦ Â¦

Vercevich has three times been the vic-
ton street 'to Portsmouth Square, oppo
site the Hall of Justice, and resting on one
of the benches.
Yesterday afternoon he was seated as
usual on the bench, w"hen" Matthew Dal
ton, a husky young fellow, took a ieat
beside him. Dalton entered Into conver
sation with the old man and bewailed the
fact that. -although young and strong, he
could not find work.
"That's all nonsense," said Harold.
"When I was about your age I left Ire
land for this counjry and when I arrived
I had only sixpence in my pocket. I look
ed, for work and got It, and if you were
anxious to work you could do the same
thing and save money, aa-I have done."
Dalton sneered at the ola man, and said
he .did not believe he had saved any
money. "I'll bet you four bits," he said
"that you can't show a $20 gold .piece >:
This angered Harold and he said he would
accept the bet. A man who was passing
was called and the two 50-cent pieces wera
placed in his hand. Dalton at once grab
bed the money and started to run, but

Before Dalton could use his flsta Harold
pulled his revolver out of his pocket and
brought the butt end down with stun

blow made Dalton quit, and with the as
sistance of the stakeholder Harold too'c
Dalton to the City Prison and booked hhn
on a charge of petty larceny.
