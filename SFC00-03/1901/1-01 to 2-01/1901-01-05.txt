(^^^ wife of Conrad Ruff and step-

who were burned to death here
on the mornlnÂ«r of December 22,
has been charged with murder and arson.
The complainant is Carl Ruff, a brother

'.' Oh 'the morning of December 22 tho
home of. Conrad Ruff, who -conducted a
dairy near the corner if Alviso road ami
Hamllne street,' on the northern outskirts
of the city, was totally destroyed by fire.
Four childrenâ Carl, Kate, Barbara and
Conrad Jr., aged from 6 to 14 years â were
burned to death. Two others, Mary and
Louis, were dragged from the burning
structure through a window by William
Valdez, a hired man. Mrs. Ruff, the sec
ond wife of Ruff and stepmother of Vcs
children, was rescued with her three
weeks-old babe in her arms. Conrad Ruff,
the father, in frantic effort* to get to his
children, was badly burned about the
hands. y^'i'^/VK
This morning Carl Ruft, a brother of her
husband, appeared' in Justice Rosenthal's
court and i swore to warrants charging
Mrs. Ruff with murder and arson. He al
leged that she maliciously and felonious
ly set fire to the [house which caused the
death of Carl Ruff, one of the children.
According to the story, o* the brother
ln-Iaw the woman's actions since the fire
have been very susplc'.ous. ' He says that
Mrs. Ruff never showed any, love for tho
children and barely tolerated them. He
declares that Mrs. : Ruft, shortly before
;thÂ© fire, packed her; clothing and jewelry
Into r trunjts and had them stored in a
tankhouse some distance from the housa
burned. She moved all ,the children into
one room and 'the four that were burned
to death occupied one bed. , In this posi
tion their charred bodies were found. Th a
other two slept' on a couch on the floor.
Â¦When the hired man and Ruff, who were
milking the cows, saw smoke issuing from
the house and rushed to the building, it is
alleged, the back door was locked and
they could not get In. This door had been
open a few, minutes before. . Another sus
picious ] fact, Carl Ruff declares, is that
the woman .was ' warmly dressed K beneath
her nightdress and ; her . own baby, which
was rescued, was well clad and was lying
on a pillow" outside ' the ' window. . \ , .

THE steamer Iaqua, which left this city yesterday afternoon for San Diego with a cargo of general merchandise, was;wrecked last night on Duxbury Reef, just outside the Golden Gate, and all on board, with the single exception
of Chief Engineer Burrill, who was washed ashore on an overturned boat after being in the water two hours, are believed to have perished. Details are meager, but it is known'that there were between thirty and forty person*
on board the ill-fated vessel at the time of the accident.
The Iaqua sailed from Eureka several days ago for San Pedro and put in he^e yesterday to land some passengers. As soon as that duty had been attended to, Captain Basch put to sea again. How the disaster- occurrea
is of course not known at this writing, but there was a heavy swell on outside the heads last night and it is probable that the unfortunate vessel, drifting too near the reef in the haze that overspread the water, was thrown upon
the rocks bv the swell. She is a total loss.
Chief Engineer Burrill reached the # shore and telephoned to William G. Mugan, representative of Dolbeer & Carson, agents for the vessel in this city, saying the steamer was in distress and asking for assistance. The Red Stack
people were notified and started at once for the scene of the disaster. .
These facts were communicated by Air. Dolbeer early this morning, but he could give no further particulars. Dolbeer owned one 7/ eighth of the vessel and the other seven-eighths were owned by the Humboldt Shingle Man
ufacturing Association, by whom she was loaded. Mr. Dolbeer said the steamer was. on her way to this port, but in this he is N evidently mistaken, as the records of the Merchants' Exchange show that she cleared for San Pedro at 4:30
o'clock yesterday afternoon. \ . â¢â¢ \ ' â¢ ' â¢
How the engineer got ashore neither Mr. Dolbeer nor any one else seems to know. Burrill probably was too excited to give details. At 2 o'clock this morning it was reported from Point Reyes that the vessel had gone to
pieces, and as no more boats came ashore the presumption is that the thirty or forty people known to have been on board 'Â¦ were drowned. It is of course possible that the other boats may have landed their passengers at some point
where it was not possible to communicate with the city quickly, -and it is also possible that .'the rescuing tugs may have arriveci on the scene in time to pick them up.
Chief Engineer Burrill Is Washed io Land on an Overturned Boat and Telephones for Assistance,
but the Doomed Vessel Goes Down With Crew and Passengers Before Help Arrives.

NEW AMENDMENT
General Provision to Be

Bill.
WASHINGTON. Jan. - 4.â Senator Hoar
to-day offered an amendment to the army
bill In the shape of a general provision.
as follows:
"Provided, that no further military
force shall be used In the Phillpplnn
Islands except such as may be necessary
to keep order In places there now actually
under the peaceable control of the Unitel
States and to protect persons or property
to whom. In the judgment of the Presi
dent, protection may be due from the
United States until the President 3hall
have first proclaimed amnesty for all po
litical offenses committed against tne
United States in the Philippines, and. if
in his power, shall have agreed upon an
armistice with persons now in hostility
to the United States and shall have in
vited such number, not less than ten, a:s
he shall think desirable, of the leaders or
representatlves of the persons now hostile
to the United States there to come to zi\e
United States and state their wishes ar.il
the condition, character and wishes of the
people of the Philippine Islands to the
executive and Congress, and shall have
offered to secure to them safe conduct
to come, abide and return and shall have
provided at the public charge for the ex
penses of their transportation both ways
nnd their stay in this country for a rea
sonable and sufficient time for such pur
poses."
that the matter will be amicably ar
ranged, and are working energetically to
this end. Great pressure has been brought
to near on the President and Secretary
of State to Induce the administration tt>
interfere in the interest of one or other
of the companies.
Senator Depew made representations to
the State Department in behalf of the
"Warner syndicate, which claims a share
in the concession held by the New York
and Bermudez Company. Senator For
aker of Ohio accompanied Mr. Warner
yesterday to the State Department and
the White House, but it Is understood he
merely Introduced Mr. Warner to tht

no part In the controversy. The Presi

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.-Apprehen
slon is felt in official circles that the con-
troversy which has arisen over the as
phalt lake concessions in Venezuela may
require forcible intervention by the United
States. According to the highest author
ity, the President has no Intention of In
terfering between the rival American
claimants to concessions, but he docs not
intend to permit the Venezuelan Govern
ment to cancel a concession given In good
faith to American citizens and forcibly
dispossess the concessionaries of their
property until a Judicial decision has been
rendered in support, of this action.
Under instructions given to him. Minis
ter Loomis Is urging the Caracas Govern
ment not to attempt to dispossess the
New Tork and Bermudez Company until
the Supreme Court of. Venezuela has
passed upon the pending lawsuits, which
involve the question In dispute, but un
official Information received In Washing
ton indicates that if the Venezuelan Gov
ernment insists that It has the right tn
dispossess, the 'New York and Bermudez
people, most of whom are Americans and
are armed, will resist dispossession.
In case of an armed conflict, the United
States will have to act. and In anticipa
tion of this contingency three warships
were ordered to La Guayra. " >.
The authorities are hopeful, however.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE,. Jan. 4.â Oriental advices re
ceived here to-day give details of a con
flict that occurred at Hongkong on the
night of December 1 between British blue
jackets and marines and a body of French
sailors. During the day the latter amused
themselves by marching In a body
through the streets of the town, headed
by one man bearing the tricolor and an
other playing an accordeon. At first they
conducted themselves quietly enough, but
later on they grew rather noisy. March
ins in a body to an establishment in Ship
street, where a number of British sailors
were collected, the Frenchmen attempted
to clear the whole place, but found the
task beyond their weight, and were them
selves driven out.
Determined on having revenge, they
gathered reinforcements and returned to
the scene of the encounter. During their
absence, however, the Englishmen had
had their numbers swelled by the arrival
of a crowd of bluejackets and marines,
who had learned of what was going on
and had hurried to the scene. Speaking
of what followed, the Shanghai Daily
Press says: .
"The reception accorded the Frenchmen
may be better imagined than -described,
as the phrase goes. Suffice It to say that
the sprinting exhibition they gave up
Queens Road Central was a revelation In
what men can do when they are put to
it."

to Peking, but to takÂ© up; residence In a
more secluded portion of the ChinasÂ© em
pire, according to mail advices received
here. The Universal Gazette, In a recent

confirmed.
The i Empress believes that it will not
be advisable for her to accompany the
Emperor in case hÂ« decides to return to
Peking, realizing that her presence at the
capital would be welcome neither to the
ruler nor the representatives of the pow

TRIBUTE TO BRAVE AMERICANS
Lord Lansdowne Praises tho Acts of
Game well and Squires.
"WASHINGTON. Jan. 4.â The British
Ambassador has communicated to the Sec
retary of State a dispatch recently received
by him from the Marquis of Lansdowne
commending the gallant conduct of cer
tain Americans who distinguished them
selves last summer during the attacks on
the legation quarter In Peking. The text
of the dispatch follows: â¢Â¦ -
"My Lord:- "With reference to my- pre
ceding dispatch of this day's date, I have
to lnffrm you that Sir C. Macdonald has
brought to my notice the conduct of cer
tain Americans who particularly distin
guished themselves during the attacks on
the legation quarter and who gave valu
able â¢ assistance, both to . him personally
and to the defense in general.
"Sir Claude mentions the names of the
Rev. P. r>. Â¦ Gamewell of the American
Methodist mission and Herbert Squiers,
secretary of the United States legation.
He states that the Rev. F..D. Gamewell
carried out tha entire defenses of the
British legation, and that these defenses
have excited the admiration of the officers
of various Â¦ nationalities who have since
inspected them. , ,
"As a tribute to their excellence he
mentions that notwithstanding a constant
rain of rifle fire during the five weeks of
the siege not a single woman or child in
the legation suffered. He adds that a deep
debt of gratitude is owed ' to ; him by â¢ all
the besieged. Â¦ . '
"Herbert Squiers acted in the capacity
of Sir Claude's chief of staff after the
death of. Captain Strouta of the Royal
Marines. Sir Claude, says that histearlier
services In the United States army were
of great use in'thf Oofense, and that he
cannot speak too highly of his zeal and
ability.
"The barricades on the Tartar wall were
devised and carried out by him, and under
Sir Claude's â¢ directions Â¦ he : drew the plan
for the -entry of the .troops, which was
conveyed to General Gaselee by, a messen

MARIETTA. Ohio, Jan. 4.â At Hack

Morris was returning home from the

threw her to the ground. She screamed
and fought hard, finally getting to her
feet. Woinstock drew a razor from his
pocket and cut her across the neck, sever
ing the neck muscles and laying bare the
jjug-ular vein. Miss Morris grasped the
razor and her hands were cut in her mad

wrist badly cut, as well as her entire

disfigured. Her dress was torn from her

MARQUIS OF AVA
A HEAVY LOSER
LONDON, Jan. 5.â The Marquis of Duf
ferin and Ava spent a long time yester
day at the offices of the Ixmdon and
Globe Finance Corporation, limited. It is
rumored that he is a heavy personal loser
by the difficulties, but that Whltaker
Wright quite recently loaned Â£30,000 to
the company and is its largest creditor.
All kinds of rumors are current as to
deals to enable the company to pay a
dividend, but the Times In its financial
article says:
"We are able to deny that either the
Yerkes Group or thÂ© London and South
western Railway Company has purchased
the Baker-street line, although we are
not able to say whether a sale has actu
ally occurred.
Both the Times and the Dally Telegraph
advise the London and Globe sharehold
ers to insist upon a compulsory winding
up of the company's affairs.
The sensational fluctuations in Ameri
cans on the Stock Exchange yesterday
are believed to be partly due to the vary
ing rumors about the London and Globe
crisis, but chiefly to the influence of Wall
street dealings. Fears of a further rise in
the Bank of England rate had also some
thing to do with the decline, but there
was a better feeling after the closing, due
to the phenomenal rise in Chicago, Mil
waukee and St. Paul, which went as high
as ten points above the lowest quotation
of the day.
The Financial Times considers the
American shake-out to be the outcome of
the 5 per cent bank rate and esks what
would happen if anything . untoward oc
curred in New York. It declares that
"American trusts and bankers are heav
ily committed for a rise which already
reaches, a dangerous point, at which the
London market ought .to apply common
sense."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â The State De
partment Is making a strong effort to se
cure an. understanding among the pow
ers to serve as a basis for the adjustment
of the question of indemnity 'to be paid
by the Chinese Government. It appears
from Mr. Conger's reports that it is hope
less to expect the foreign Ministers at
Peking to reach an agreement on this im
portant point, and if the problem Is to be
solved at all it must be removed from the
Peking council and dealt with by direct
diplomatic exchange, as was successfully
attempted in the case of the preceding se
rious differences between the Ministers.
Therefore the State Department is in
correspondence with other- foreign- offices
respecting this subject, though the nego-/,
tiatlons have not proceeded . to a point
where it can be said that a successful ter
mination is in sight. The principal differ
ence in the way is believed to be the enor
mous Indemnities demanded by some of
tho powers. The efforts of â¢ the Chinese
Government to secure better terms, so far
as they tend to protract the negotiations
are also expected to have the result of
adding considerably to the sum total
which must be paid in the end. This is
because the expenses of maintaining the
foreign military establishments in China
probably will be assessed against the Chi
nese Government, and the cost of keeping
foreign troops in Peking at this season of
the year, and In a country where every
necessity of life has to be transported
from a distance, will make the bill very
heavy. It is believed that the bill of Ger
many will be by far the largest, and it is
a significant fact that the German Gov
ernment has allowed its officers on service
in China five-fold their regular: salaries,
a rate of pay hitherto unknown in mili
tary history. - The Chinese, however, are
expected to pay for this.
The attitude of Russia in Manchuria has
given rise to considerable apprehension
here. As Indicated in recent news dis
patches, a series of regulations has been
promulgated by the Russian Government
for the administration of affairs In China,
â¢which would seem to the officials here to
â¢warrant an apprehension that a per
manent occupation of that territory.' with
Its population of 20,000,000, is contemplated.
It is believed that. some .representations
either have been or will" be; made on this)
subject to the powers. - When the Russian
Government announced, its intention- to
withdraw Its troops from Peking it also
solemnly declared that "as soon as lasting
order shall have been established, in Man
churia and I indispensable measures taken
for the protection of every construction
which, according, to formal -< agreement,
China assured,' Russia will not fail to

Kruger to visit America. While In Paris
they will see the leaders of the arbitra

"The time has come for President Kru

clare his intention to visit President Me-
Klnley in order to plead with him the
cause of the independence of the South
African republics. Mr. Kruger is looked
at askance in Germany and Austria be
cause he is the President of a republic,
but he thinks this will not be regarded as
a disqualification for his reception by the
President of the greatest republic In the
world.
"He does not believe the American Gov
ernment is indifferent to the war the
Boers are waging against the British
monarchv. If ho goes to America he will
go as a President to visit a President. He
will probably arrive in Now York in the
middle of February. The state of his
health is not regarded as likely to 'deter
him from crossing the Atlantic. He had
believed the voyage would take a fort

"His movements somewhat depend uron

tt OS ANGELES, Jan. 4â "How
1 1 will I run the Southern Pacific
I l>r Railroad â as a railroad or a
political machine P As a busi
ness proposition, most assuredly. Tho
road will cater to ths people first, last
and all the time, and no discrimina
tion will ba shown; but I shall never,
forget that- my first duty is to the
stockholders of the railroad. A rail
road can 'subserve 'ths interests of the
people and at the same time be a
money-making proposition. These
two things I shall- endeavor to do as
long as I continue as president of the
Southern Pacific." r v ;
Thoso were the words of- Charles M.
Hays..' the' newly' elected president of Uio
Southern ' Pacific Railroad system, xvhr,
passed' through I*os Angeles this morning.
He is on his way to San Francisco to
take up the rpins of office.
A broad-shouldered man of medium
height, about 50 years cf age, with clear,
gray eyes, square, firm jaw covered-by
a heavy brown beardâ such a man in ap
pearance, is Mr. Havs. He has a low
pitched, clear voice and an' easy manner
in conversation, but underlying it all la
the forceful, determined air of a man who
is born to command. He. is' a self-made
man, one who has forced himself up to
the eminence he now occupies by work
hard work and plenty of it. This doed
not appear in his conduct towar.l
strangersâ quite the reverse. He Is ready
and willing to listen patiently and attent
ively to the words uf any person with
whom he is in conversation. In answering
questions he arrives at the subject at pnee
and his replies are in few words and to
the point.
Mr. Hays was guarded in his replies to
questions without being evasive. He wa.i
giving up time to an interview which
could have been spent in other ways to
excellent advantage, vet he never gave
any sign that he wished the conversation
brought to a close. Vice President Stubbs
and General Manager Kruttschnitt weru
standing a few feet away in the gardens
of the Arcade depot. They manifested
their impatience in several ways anl
finally Mr. Stubbs interposed the remark
that the time for departure was drawing
near, but Mr. Hays quietly replied that
he wanted to know and be near the people
of California and as his first introduction
was through the newspapers he was glad
to give his time to the newspaper men. :
"Los Angeles merchants think they
have been discriminated against In the
matter of freight rates to certain points,"
he continued. "What will I do with the
case? Well, really, that is a . difficult
question to answer, but you may say to
the people of this city that it is my in
tention to treat all the Interests of the
city with fairness.
"The interests of the people and
the interests of the railroad are iden
tical at all times. "If the people ara
prosperous," the railroad will be pros
perous. This statement applies not
only to Los Angeles but to the State
of California at large. It is some
what difficult to please all of the peo
ple all the time, but my policy is to
do this as nearly as possible."
"Will we "build a branch line to San
Diego? I can answer that best by ask
ing another question. Is there anything
In. San Diego which warrants building an
other railroad to that point?" '
Before answering a question In regard
to the Galveston terminals, Mr. Hays
warily asked if that port was considered
competitive with San Pedro. - On being
assured to the contrary, he smiled and
replied that the work was being pushed
with all possible dispatch.
"One can never be too cautious In mak
ing- statements where sectional jealousies
exist." continued Mr. Hays., "There were
five lake ports on the railway with which
I have just severed my connection and
every one of the five felt that it was en
titled to special privileges. My way out
of the matter was to supply enough busi
ness for them all."
In regard to rumored changes, In of
ficials, Mr. Hays rather dodged the issue.
He refused to confirm the report from
Galveston, which stated that no changes

Chicago Hygienic Expert Pro-
pounds a New and Start-
ling Theory.
(Special to the New Tork World.)
Chicago, Dec 2.â Dr. Albert H. Hoy.
after years of patient research, says ex-
ercise is positively unhealthful for men
past thirty-five years- of age. Dr. Hoy
has published a book on ''Eating and
Drinking" which Is praised by the pro-
fession. Helsa specialist In hygiene.
"I say that exercise for the business
man ', or men past middle age is detri-
mental. I exclude the young man and
the laborer. Every action, whether of the
brain or of the muscles, destroys cells,
uses up tissue and creates waste matter
to be taken up by the blood and to be
eliminated from the system.
"Now. unless such waste Is eliminated
It becomes so much poison In the system.
The great eliminating machine of the
human body is the kidneys. Unless the
kidneys do their work the system is sat-
urated with poison. -
Senator. Davis a Case in Point.
"For Instance, there is the sad case of
Senator Davis. His toe was poisoned by
his stocking and refused to heal. Kidney
complaint developed, or rather the kid-
neys for a long time had not done their
full work, and the system was so poisoned
that the toe became gangrened.
"The kidneys work easily during youth
â up, say. to 85 years of age. But after
60 they become slightly atrophied: they
shrink a little. This is not disease, but
a simple effect of age. Consequently, as
a man advances In years he should ask
his kidneys. to perform a little less work.
Instead of a little more.
"But, suppose a. man of business not
only, uses his brain during business hours,
but also puts a strain on his muscles
afterward. There is waste then to be
carried riff, mental wastÂ« < and physical
waste, the , broken-down brain .cells and
those of, the muscles likewise.- Thus the
kidneys are forced to do. double duty, to
eliminate poisons resulting from two sorts
of action. .
~ "A business man should get aU the ex-
ercise he needs from the requirements of
his business. A long walk only further
calls upon his reserve. Violent golf or
tennis only puts a greater strain upon h!s
system. If he says ha needs fresh air.
oxygen, he can get It In his office. If the
latter be properly ventilated. He doesn't
need to exercise to breathe fresh air.
Rockefeller Cited.
"John D. Rockefeller drives a fast â¢
horse. That gives him air, but It doesn't \
give him exercise. Joseph Chamberla n -'
takes no exercise except what he get*
from stepping from his office to his car-
riage. He Is never sick. Senator William
M. Eyarts Is i a very old man. He never
exercised. That is his boast
"But business men say. 'But I need ex-
â¢ er f ls 2^ X do not feel w Â« n unless I have
It. That means generally that they eat
too much. Tou can poison your system
by eating too much, putting into yourself
raw* _ than* the kidneys can eliminate.
Now Chamberlain, who takes no exercise.
I have no doubt is a light eater."
What We Have Always Said.
TVe are pleased to note that scientists of
"Potation are coming to share the views
held by the proprietors of "Warner's SafÂ»
Cure for the past twenty years, vise: That
the kidneys ara the great eliminating or-
gans of the system. Nature made them
so and man never has nor can Improve
on nature. If the poisons of the system
are driven out as nature Intended, health
Is assured, but If these great organs are
overworked, sick, and breaking down al-

were Inundated. The house was occupied
by a Mexican couple, who got out of It
Just in time to save themselves from being
killed cr seriously Injured by the flying
debris.
It was about 7 o'clock, when the wind
wa3 blowing fiercest, that the tank came
down with a crash. It. was a rickety
affair and had been bwaying ominously
all day. The tank had been filled to over
flowing by the recent rains. The noise of
the falling timbers startled the entire
neighborhood. When the people rushed
out of their houses to see what was tha
matter they found. that the Dunleavy cot
tage had been demolished. It was flat
tened on the ground. One or two up
rights of the windmill left standing bore
evidence to what hatl happened.
Some fears were expressed among the
spectators ' that the occupants of tlic
dwelling had been caught In the wreck

among the spectators of the wreck' and
were given shelter for the night. All their
effects were destroyed.

Cajj^HE aftermath of the storm does
1 not reveal any great amount of
I damage along the water front. The
H underpinning of the wharves has
suffered considerably and" the bay I
is covered with floating f>Iles. A few ves

wa3 busy all of yesterday getting the

River steamers were decayed, the steam
fishing fleet had to take refuge In Drakes
Bay. coasters were all behind time, out
ward bound vessels are waiting for the |
gale to subside in orCer to get to sea and
work along the front is at a standstill.
Should it clear up during the night there
will be a rush to discharge and load, and
longshoremen will be In demand.
The arrivals yesterday were very few
and far between. The Point Arena got in
from Point Arena. Last Wednesday she .
ran into very heavy weather. When the
steamer began to labor the captain ran
into Drakes Bay. There she lay for twen
ty-four hours, and while there the fishing
fleet came scurrying in to keep her com
pany. When the Point Arena steamed
away for San Franc'seo yesterday morn-
Ing she left quite a fleet behind her.
River Steam*rs in Plenty of Trouble.
The steamer Gold started for Petaluma
last Thursday afternoon. When the gale
came up she was in a perilous position for
a few minutes, but the captain managed
to get her about and succeeded In- reach
ing a place of refuge under Point Pedro.
The J. D. Peters and the Captain Weber
both left Stockton while the gale was rag
ing. The Peters went back to her berth
but the Weber 'kept on. She was blown
on a mudbank and hung there for ten
hours. Finally she was got off and made
San Francisco at 1:20 p. m. yesterday. The
Peters remained at Stockton all night,
and when the gale was over started for
San Francisco; arriving here at 3:30 p. m.
The Sacramento steamer Apache left
here at 1 p. m. Thursday, but when well
on her way the gale became so heavy that
she had to put about and seek shelter un
der the lee of The Brothers.
The.Vallejo steamer Monticello was also
caught in the pale. Crossing. from Lom
bard-street wharf to Angel Island she got
the full force of the blast and lay over
until her decks were awash. Passing The
Brothers she caught it again, but her cap
tain stuck to It and she finally reached
Vallejo, not on time, but still in the ring.
STEAMER AMERICAN
COMES INTO PORT
The Hawaiian-American Steamship
Company's new steamship American ar
rived from New York yesterday. She Is
a duplicate of the CaHfornlan, built by the
Union Iron Works, and seems to be as
equally good a vessel as the onenowundcr
charter to the Government. The Amer
ican left New Xork sixty-six days ago
and called at St. Lucas for coal. Her
next stop was at Coronel and from there
she came on to San Francisco without
stop. "We had a splendid trip all the
way around until we struck the
Farallone?," said Captain Macdonald yes
terday. "Then I thought I was off Cape
Hatteras again. It blew a hurricane and
carried away a few ventilators and
smashed in a few skylights, but the dam
age does not amount to a row of pins."
The American will go from here to
Puget Sound, where she will load for
Honolulu. From Honolulu she will go to
Hilo and load sugar for New York and
will then come back to San Francisco.
NEWS FROM AMONG
WHARVES AND DOCKS
Captain Metcalfe, Lloyds* surveyor,
writing from Santa Rosalia. Is of the
opinion that the German ship Edmund
that went ashore there last month will
be got off. She is broadside on the
beach and drawing twelve feet aft and
nine feet forward. The Spreckels' tug
Luckenbach Is hard at work pumping her
out, while stevedores are at work remov
ing the ballast. Judging from the new*
received, the Edmund should now be off
the beach. and any day a telegram may be
expected stating that she Is on her way
to San : Francisco In tow of the Lucken
bach.
A. Peterson, an insane man, Jumped off
the Jackson-street wharf yesterday. He
was rescued by some of the dock handa
and hurried to the Harbor Hospital,
where Dr. Putnam soon had him out of

the Iron Mountain copper mines, but that
his home Is in heaven. '.

THE heavy storm which Ban Fran
cisco experienced in the past
forty-eight hours caused the loss
of one life in addition to the dam
age to property already reported.
Carl Claus Dorgeloh, a 16-year-old lad,
â¢was Instantly killed by a live electric
wire early yesterday morning while de
livering copies of The Call to subscribers
on the corner of Ashtrary and Frederick
streets. The body of the unfortunate lad
was discovered lying on the tracks of the
San Francisco and San Mateo electric
railroad. C. Schade, a driver for Wester
feld'e bakery, had his attention called to
the body by* the balking of his horse. He
saw something lying on the tracks and
was horrified to nnd the body of Dorge
loh. Schade at once notified Officer
Stephen Eunner of Golden Gate Park,
Â¦who made an examination of the spot
where the body was found. The officer
discovered a broken electric light wire
hanging over the track. The wire had
been torn from its fastenings by the high
wind and had dropped after the first car
of the Ellis-street line had passed under
It. Dr. Rumwell was called to examine
the body and found that the boy had
been dead for some time. A blue bruise
on the back of the left hand near the
base of the third finger showed where the
bolt of electricity had entered and a sim
ilar bruise on the heel marked the point
cf exit.
The peculiarly sad feature of the case
Js the fact that the boy was the sole sup
port of his widowed mother. He attended
public school In the daytime and went to
work as early as 3 o'clock in the morning
to deliver papers for the carrier owning
the route in that part of the city. Carl
was a lad of many good traits ana was
very popular among his associates.
Boreas Gave Way to Jupiter Pluvius.
The sway of Boreas was interrupted
yesterday in the city and Jupiter Pluvius
reigned rapreme, but according to the
weather prophet the ctonn king: will prob
ably visit San Francisco again to-day.
The heavy blow which did so much
damage oa Thursday was succeeded yes
terday by copious showers and but little
wind. The 6torm king did not retire be
cause he thought that San Francisco had
experienced sufficient of his work, but he
Â¦was fcrced out to sea by an area of high
pressure which came down from British
Columbia.
It is a wise thing to heed the warnings
oJ the weather prophet, and all who go
abroad to-day j-hould provide themselves
with umbrellas, rubber overshoes and
mackintoshes, for these articles will be
needed.
The city showed evidences yesterday of
the force cf the storm which Bwept down,
oa Thursday. No matter in what direction
one went electric light and telephone
wires could be found In a damaged condi
tion. The best testimony as to the de-
Eirability of doing away with the un-
Eightly and dangerous advertising fences
was seen In the wreckage of the eyesores.
All over the city sidewalks were blocked
with thÂ« ruined fences, and where the
wreckage had been cleared away the
printed bills and paste formerly on the
fences made it dangerous for pedestrians
to walk. The companies owning the dam
aged electric light and telephone wires
did but Jittle to restore the service. The
broken wires were in many instances sim
ply tied around the poles bearing them,
with the probability of another high wind
carrying the loose wires away, thus en
dangering the lives of passers by.
In the city's breathing spots and In
Golden Gate Park and the panhandle the
fury of the storm was shown by broken
trees, fihrubs and flowers.
In the residence and business portion of
the city employment was given to many
men. repairing broken wlndowB, chimneys
8nd roofs.
A beautiful eight was to be seen out
on the ocean front. The storm had back
ed out to sra and tho wind forced the wat
er in huge waves right up to the drive
way, and tat little was to be seen of the
Seal Kocks from the Cliff House. With
mighty force th*Â» waves dashed on the
beach, sending volumes of white spray
hundreds of feet into the air. Many per
sons braved the unpleasant weather yes
terday to see the fury of nature
Weather Prophet McAdip was the hap
piest man In the city yesterday for all
of his predictions made on New Year's
day as to the storm had come true.
In speaking of the storm and? the exist
ing conditions la*t Â»v<>n!ng, Mr. McAdic
said:
"At Z p. m. the reports ?ho*- that tho
Ftorm covers the entire Pacific slope. It
Is now raining at Los Angeles and" the
conditions for rain are favorable south of

around the grounds, most of which were
thickly covered with ivy, offered a fair
mark for the wind and fully seventy-five
feet were blown flat. Fully fifty large
trees were uprooted aiid in many other
cases large branches were broken away
from the trunks.
Despite the stormy weather the steamer
Resolute was enabled to make one trip
from the transport dock to the Presidio
wharf with 132 of the bodies brought
from Manila on the Grant. Handling the
remains was not an easy matter owing
to the Immense weight of the zinc-lined
caskets and the contents, the choppy con
dition of the bay and the heavy rain, but
they were all placed under cover before
nightfall. It is expected the transfer of
the bodies will be completed to-day.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Walter C.
Chidester has been assigned to temporary

transportation to the Philippines.

Looking In the direction .of the sound he
saw his i wife had just started Â¦ to ford
Rancheria Creek, the bridge being washed

the heavy rain. ShS had discovered when
too late that she had made a' terrible
mistake. The stage started to float

Calling for help, Milde made a dash for
the edge of the stream, less than 100 yards
away. A bystander, picking up a coil of
rope joined him. Mllde made a splendid
throw of the rope and '-his wife caught
one end and fastened it around her body.
Then she threw herself bodily into the
torrent and was hauled' ashore., though
nearly drowned. The stage was carried

HAS A NARROW ESCAPE
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 4.â With de
structive fury the storm king tra
versed this cit>; and county last
night, causing damage that will
amount to thojsands of dollars.
The storm reached its height at 8 o'clock.
Fallen trees, wrecked broken w*n
dows, leveled fences ar.d splintered sheds
and outbuildings greeted the eye to-day
as reminders of the breezy visitation.
The storm vented '.ha full force of its
fury upon the Tamuloais Tavern, situ
ated at the top of Mount Tamalpais. Ov*r
the brush-covered rMgts and across il3
bleak summit the wind and rain swept
with terrific force. The roof of the tavern
was torn from the building and scattered
over the mountain side. 1 ne sound of its
fall was heard above tho din of the storm
and caused terror amjng the inmates of
the hotel, all of whom, fortunately, es
caped unhurt. Much of the furniture has
been removed to the pavilion, whore it
will remain until the hotel is repaired.
A large brick, chimney on the Wilkins
building in thi<rcity was blown down. It

city, on the Hotalirg lanch, a large barn
in course of construction' was blown down.
Dozens of railings, t-ls-is, porches ami
roofs were wrecked in San Rafael, while
the storm raged. The iocal telephone and
telegraph service \vaj put out of commis
sion and it will be several days before
it is repaired. The large outbuildings or
the Greenbrae brickvards were blown
down, as were those ot the gas company
in this city.
This morning a narrow gauge train wa*
stopped by a gum tree across the track.
It was soon removed. - Â¦-, -
At Larkspur the fuil force of the storm
was felt. It swept .up the canyons and
fences, roofs and oorches went by tlu
board. Three houses'. were demolished.
The dwelling of A. J. Marriott was Â«j
uueed to debris, as were the Heydenfeldt
and Helling houses. By good fortune the
houses were unoccupied at the time.
At Sausalito the storm demolished the
narrow gauge earsr.fds, imprisoning
many cars in the debris. - A wharf was
damaged and several hmall boats were
lost. Last night the steamers had much
difficulty in landing, but beyond fright
and seasickness among some of the pas
sengers little damagi! was done. . >
In Mill Valley the Woodward House
lost its roof and windows and fences'
throughout. the valley suffered.
At Tiburon several small boats were
lost. At Point San Pedro the Chinese
shrimp fishing villages were almost swept
away. The frightened Mongols left their
flimsy shelters and sought refuge in the
gulches back of their camps. Many of
their nets, wharves and Junks were Io3t.
A half dozen of their huts were picked up
by the storm and scattered over the
ridjjes.
Up the channel of a slough this side of
Black Point two market hunters battled
all night for their lives. Their small ail:
pounded Itself to pieces in the shallow
water and the two men tried to wade to'
the shore. They mired in the soft ooze
repeatedly and several times almost gave
up hope, but by hard work they reached
solid ground, at midnight and made their
way to a farmhouse.
Bolinas has not been heard from. Fallen
trees blocked the road and have destroyed
the telephone line. In Lagunitas Canyon
a woodchopper's cabin was crushed by a
falling pine tree and the . man had a
miraculous escape from death. . The trunk
of the tree fell across the lower end of
the small hut, crushing the little struc
ture to the ground. Its occupant was
sleeping on his bunk at the other end of
the cabin and escaped with a few bruises.

reports of trees blown down, bridges
washed away and U-iephone and electric
light wires demolished. The b!g apron
bridge crossing Russian River here was
carried away last i;:'Â£ht.
Telegraphic reports from various points in Central and Northern California testify to the fury
of the storm of Thursday night and yesterday. In Marin County and througli the Sonoma Valley exten
sive damage was done. A number of dwellings were razed by the wind and in all directions leveled fences
and trses and the wreckage of chimneys, signsand roofs are left as mnindjrs of the prankish zephyrs.
Guests of Tamalpais Tavern, at the peak of the mountain across the bay, wers given a severe fright. The
famous hostelry was unroofed and its inmates feared for a time that the entire structure would be car
ried away. At Tiburon and Sausaiito considerable damage was done to wharves and a number of small
boats were lost. Throughout the interior of the State there was much destruction of property. Yreka re
ports the loss of the entire plant of the Sheba Hining Company, in which San Franciscans ars heavily in

The only regular scheduled event on
any of the local links for this afternoon
Is a ladies' putting contest on the Oakland
course. If the weather Js at all favorable
it is likely that some matches In the
round robin tournament will be played on
the Presidio course, which, owing to the
light, sandy character of Its soil, may be
played on, even after heavy rains. The
round robin matches which have so far
been played resulted as follows: H. B.
Goodwin has scored 2 against Worthing
ton Ames, H. C. Golcher 1 against S. L.
Abbot Jr., Lansing O. Kellogg 1 against
R. II. Gaylord. and R. H. Gaylord 1
against Captain D. J. Rumbaugh.
The annual contest on New Year's day
for the Liverpool gold medal, which is
emblematic of the medal play champion
ship of the San Francisco Golf Club,
brought out^ a dozen players, of whom S.
L. Abbot Jr. made the Dest score â 93 for
the eighteen holes. This was six strokes
better than the score with which the 6anie
player won the gold medal on New Year's
day, 1839, there being no contest for it in
19J0. In 1S39 the contest for the Liver
pool silver medal was a separate one and
was wone by E. J. McCutchen after tying
with A. B. Williamson. This year the
same scores were counted for both events,
the gross in the gold medal contest and
the net In the silver medal competition.
Warren Gregory won the silver medal,
his score being 99 less 10â S3. The silver
medal should be competed for each month
but no contest for it has taken place for a
long time.
The annual meeting of the members of
the San Francisco Golf Club takes place
this afternoon In the clubhouse, when of
ficers will be elected to serve during the
coming year. It Is probable that the
same board will be re-elected. . â¢
The ladles of the San Francisco Golf
Club are manifesting great interest in the
game, though challenge class matches do
not occur with much frequency. Mrs.
R. G. Brown, however, is regularly chal
lenged by Miss Maud Mullins and retains
her place against all assaults. Captain
Alice C. Hoffman has not been out at. the
links for some time and consequently or
ganized contests among the ladies have
been discontinued. There is a prospect,
however, of a highly Interesting match
between teams of eight ladies of the San
Francisco Golf Club and a like number
pf the Oakland Golf Club. As the Oak
land ladies were the losers at the contests
that took place on February 24 and March
11 of last year, the challenge will come
from them and will be issued as soon as

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Jan. 4.â "William
A. Brady, manager of the Cincinnati
fight carnival and incidentally manager
of Jim Jeffries, arrived in Cincinnati this
afternoon. Brady and Attorney Wltte
went over the law In the case thoroughly.
Brady remarked: "It is infinitely strong
er than the Horton law In New York
State was. There 1b only one man on.
earth who has the power to stop the fight
and that is Mayor Fieischman. That gen
tleman has promised the Saengerfest So
ciety that he would Issue a permit as
soon as they came to apply for it. That
permit once issued Is revocable only by
the Mayor. I am confident Mayor Fleisch
man will keep hia promise."
As a matter of fact, the law under
which Jeffries and Ruhlin are to fight Is
strong enough to bring the men together
with battle-axes. The section stipulates
that the Sheriff of any county or the
Mayor of any incorporated city may issue
a permit for a contest between man and
man. nor is there anyvlimitatlon as to the
number of rounds. Under the Supreme
Court finding it has been determined that
simply because of the fact that men bat
tle for a purse it does not constitute a
prizefight. The seating capacity of the
hall will be increased from 15,000. Its pres
ent capacity, to 24.000.
. Brady has decided to put on a stronar
attraction as ; a prelude to tho heavy
weight contest. He wants either Jack
Root or Terry McGovern against Fitz
simmons" opponent.
The- ministerial opposition is . still bit
ter, but gradually spending its force. A
bomb, however, has been exploded by the
stand taken in Ohio by Senator Foraker
The Senator, It Is understood, argues that
a fight. in Cincinnati will militate against
his chances of success in the campaign.
â¢ , l3 ._ known hs waited upon Mayor
Fleischman and implored him to revoke
the promise of a permit
It is. also known that Mayor Fldsoh
man curtly replied as follows:
"Senator, If nothing hurts you any more
in your campaign than this fight you can
consider yourself reseated; but I'll be
frank with you. Is will* admit that no
agency political or otherwise will Induce
me to break my word with the business
people of Cincinnati."^
Brady to-night volunteered the services
of Jeffries in a boxing exhibition against
the champion's sparring partner here for
the benefit of Harry Weldon. the stricken
sporting editor of tho Enquirer. It is
thought Ruhlin will be equally magnani
mous. It Is proposed to bring the testi

The puelli&tic protoplasm has arrived
and within a short ppace of time San
Francisco will be teeming with fighters of
high and low degree. They are all com
ing West, it is said, to find a stamping
ground Fafe within the purview of the
law and an atmosphere agreeable to the
j'ropagatlon of fat purses.
The century's first fistic affair will be
the double bill to be presented by the
National Sporting Club. Jack Root and
George Byers and Otto Cribb and "Dutch"
Thurston will be the performers. Root
arrived in this city on Thursday and By
Â«-rs was due last night. Root Is well liked
in San Francisco, his performances, with
a single exception, giving his admirers
'Â¦very reason to believe in his ability and
Â¦sincerity. Byers has made a reputation
for himself as a middle-weight. Out West
he is an unknown quantity, but this will
draw him a following, for the glamour of
a Californian birth does not attach to
his antagonist. Byers has a reputation
for a fair amount of cleverness and
Mrength, and is thought to be evenly
matched with Jack Root.
. Root, as is natural, denies all complicity
in the Ryan-Root fake mat poor Chicago
had foisted upon its ting patrons last
July. He says he fought his best and
knew nothing of Ryan's intentions as to
the mild method of fistic procedure.
When Ryan was here last he gave one
of his most characteristic explanations
about the fight, which was that Root was
a good, strong man, and that he declined
â¢ to take any violent chances with him,
preferring to tarn a decision" by clever
work that would result In a victory due
to outpointing. Root is now offered a
chance to redeem himself In the public
eye. What the ring patrons crave Is an
honest fight, and honest fighters will al
ways insure matches for themselves by
honest behavior. As San Francisco is to
be the rnecca of pugilists during the win
ter, a wise mixer of lists should look to
hi* reputation as well as to his purse.
Otto Cribb has won the public favor by
three rounds of fighting with Frank Mc-
ConnelL His antagonist. "Dutch" Thurs
ton. is an emanation of the San Francisco
AthleticXriub. Greggains puffs his cheat
out every time the nsjne of his protege
is mentioned, and It depends upon Cribb
whether this pectoral inflation will grow
or be everlastingly punctured. Thurston
Is equipped with more than great physi
cal strength. . Up to date he has been
without a match testing his fistic skill.
He will meet in Cribb a man that is a
fighter, and here is tho chance to win his
firet epurs.

STAKE OF YEAR
Introduction Event ( W111
Bpina Fleetest Hounds
Together.
The first of the big new year's stakes at
Union Coursing Park will be the Intro
duction, set for Sunday, January 6. Be
sides this stake the regular open event
will be for 112 dogs, many of which are of
fine quality.
The Introduction staks will bring to
gether an exceptionally fine lot of dogs â
champions every one of them, and the
best the local kennels can offer. Curtis &
Sons will be represented by Anchor, Fly-
Ing Fox, Beacon and Narcissus. E. Geary
will have Palo Alto bearing his colors, J.
H. Ro3Siter Rural Artist and Risky At
tempt. R. L. Taylor has named Mose, and
Heenan & Welcn have entered the win
ner of the John Grace stake, Sacramento
Boy. Thla stake contains enough fine
greyhound blood for any coursing 1 .
Owing to the necessary guarding Bea
con will meet Mose In the first course for
the stake favorite. Beacon has the back
ing of the talent for stake honors Palo
Alto running second.
Mose has been running: very strong of
late, and this will give Beacon work from
the very start. Palo Alto meets Narcis
sus In the first round, and hers too the
work will be of no easy stamp for either
Curtis* or Geary's dog.
Just what performance Sacramento Boy
will give is a question troubling the minds
of the talent. Sacramento Boy la particu
larly strong on good strong bares, his
staying powers coming: to his rescue. Of
late the hares have been weak.
Lady Clare is In excellent form at pres
ent, running In exceptional style.
This entire stake will be run off on Sun
day. To-day the first round of the 113-dog
stake and a portion of the second round
will be run off.
"William Growtage. the owner of Mem
ory, the best of Eastern dogs, will send
the dog to San Francisco.
Judge Grace did a piece of detective
work last week that evoked the praise of
the police department. He located a stolen
dog In two hours after the police had been
engaged for a week in trying to find the
hound.

SHOOTERS CRY
BECAUSE RAIN
SCATTERS GAME
Conditions Were Favorable
Until the Last Storm
. ? Arrived-
Beware the duck-shooter to-day. He is
ns choleric as a warm-tempered man in
a dentist's chair. And it is all due to -the
provoking eccentricities of the weather.
For four days of the week he was rubbing
his hands in great anticipatory glee. Then
the fifth day there broke a storm and
with the rain went the washing out of all
his hopes for a big. Saturday and Sunday
shoot.
High winds, overcast skies and frozen
ponds in the north made an acme of
shooting conditions for the nimrod who
blazes his shooting iron over the Sulsun
and bay mashes. Reports from the duck
districts wore fairly alive with tho best
varieties of trie bird. Now. there isn't a
duck-shooter that feels confident of
bringing in any kind of a string, even if
ho show's his enthusiasm by forcing hla
luck.
Until the rain set in on Thursday can
vasback, sprig and widgeon were flying
over the marshes In great numbers. All
the lakes and ponds in Oregon and North
ern California have frozen over and the
high winds, attended by a sinking of tho
mercury, drove the birds south flock after
flock. Had this condition' of affairs con
tinued a few days longer the shooting to
day and to-morrow would probably have
been one of tho best of the season. Should
the weather clear to-day the usual weekly
devotees will ' be out, but their expecta
tions are limited to a few stray ones.
The canvasback has been the bird of
the past two weeks, but the latest reports
show that they are not flying over the
marshes in such vast numbers at the
present time. Sprig and widgeon ' are
coming in for a share of the duck-shoot
er's compliments.
On the Field and Tule Club last Sunday
H. B. Hosmer, L. Titus, J. Wirtner, Fred
Schrine, Burt Remmel, Ai Cummings and
F. B. Bell killed 150 birds. Titus was high
bag and H. B. Hosmer a close" second. On
New Year's day Dr. Derby, Ed Briggs
and Kart Williams were out on the ponds,
but they killed only seventeen birds.
Tho Pringlo Club members had a good
shoot of "cans" Â¦ last 'Â¦ Sunday, but the
ponds were too crowded with shooters for
general convenience.
Johnny Coleman; Frank Ireland, Phil
Daly Jr. and Fred Bushnell planned a
shoot at Byron for -last* Sunday, but a
business hitch kept some of the members
at home. . : .
Milton Garatt will sail up the Sacra

Montana during the coming summer
season. Ed Laurence, who was secretary
of the racing associations at Butte and
Anaconda during the season of 1S9S, has
l>een zealously at work, and the newly
organized Montana Jockey Club is the
fruit of his labor. At a meeting recently
hold at Butte the following officials were
elected: President, H. I. Wilson; vice
president, J. T. Finlen; treasurer, Siias
F. King; secretary, Lou Frank; general
rcanujrer, Ed D. Laurence.
These officers were elected temporarily,
and another meeting will be held early in
April. Final details will be arranged in a
few days and the lists of stakes will be
announced to the public.
Money is plentiful in Montana and the
reason of 1S9S was the most successful ;n
the history cf the sport in that State.
J'urses. and liberal ones, too, were given
fnr all kinds of horses, rrom the â¢â¢Oregon
r-hnrt liner," or quarter horse, to the stake
iiuimal of the Scottish Chieftain type.
Hotting was carried on through the auc
tion and paris mutuel systems, as Mr.
Daly was antagonistic to the more mod
' rn style of booking. Now. perhaps,
l>ookie, with his chalk and chamois, may
have a chance at the game.
Dearer is also to hold a big meeting in
Jrne. Ed Gaylord, the widely known anj
popular Colorado turfman, has secured a
iive years* lease on Overland Park, and
1 reparations are being made for a grand
eeaeon of sport, both running and har
ifss. There will be a renewal of the Colo

A ripnrt published in a New York pa-
IT is now dffinitHy settled that the
death of Marcus Daly, the copper
millionaire, will not affect the pro
jected race meeting to be held In
per, that was given considerable credence,
to the effect that Lester Relff had been
commissioned by Richard Croker to buy
several rood race horses in Calif. >r n i â¢-
turns out to be a bit of dreamland. Lester
Relff says Mr. Croker never mentioned
the subject to him. and he does not see
how it got kito print. What a superb
showing some of QAir native horses would
make on the other side. To be sure. Burns
& Waterhouse possess some fairly good
material, but the others . Just Imagine
Pompino, Socialist or Torsida 8ta.ni:ig in
the Cambridgeshire.
A Kreat many people look upon Ed Cor
rigan as the only Poo Bah of racing, ar.'l
infallible when it comes to judging a piece
of horseflesh. Not so, however, according
to F. de B. Lopez. Last spring:, it ap
pears, Mr. Lopez wanted Corrigan to takt-
Articulate and train him on shares. The
dethroned Alcalde of Ingleside, the beau
tiful course within sound of the breaker.*,
did take the brown fellow, but after a
' few days' trial advised that he be a<1.1e>l
to the gelding list, and that possibly latr r
on the two-year-old might win a "dng"
race. Articulate was then turned over to
I*. Lloyd, an ex-Jockey, and now bids
fair to become a sensational three-year
old. \
It is to be regretted that Tommy Burns
will not accept any mounts at Oakland.
Tommy, It seems, has not forgotten tho
ruling made against him last season,
when he was restricted to riding for tno
Schorr stable only, during the balance of
the year 1S00. He now labors under the '
impression that the officials of the tr.-.ck
over the bay "have it in for htm." and on
the slightest pretext would again give him
a long term of suspension. SuchÂ»3 proba
bly furthest Â» from the thoughts of the
Oakland judges, and Tommy could expect
Just as fair treatment as that accorded
any other rider who behaves himself.
There is a great hue and cry amone: many
Eastern owner*, and riders that they are
afraid to come to California because of
unjust rulings dealt out. Some owners
have been coming out this way for years
and get in no trouble, and the space is
undoubtedly more valuable than the com
pany of those who do sa much objecting.

Canadian First Over the
Line at the Close of
the Fifth Day.
BOSTON, Jan. 4.â Archie. McEachern,
the clever rider from Toronto, Can., led
at the finish of the fifth day's riding at
Park Square Garden. The finish was
neither Avarm nor exciting, two of the
best sprinters, McLean and Walthour,
having fallen a quarter of ; a mile from
the end. The only sensational incident of
the day occurred just before the last
hour, when Oscar Babcock stole a lap on
the leaders. The only, serious fall of the
day was that of Stlnson at 10:30 to-night
and his mishap compelled him to have four
stitches taken in a hip wound. The pac<?
throughout was an improvement over
yesterday.
With the opening of the afternoon rid
ing there were expectations of distance
gaining sprints by some of the leaders,
but while the speed was uniformly fast
from the start to the supper hour, the po
sitions remained relatively the same. The
phypicial condition of the nine men was
surprisingly pood.
The evening racing began the forty-
Fixth hr>ur.' McEachern set the pace at
7:06. A little later Bibcock was per
mitted to lead for nearly all the first
hour, at the end of which McEachern
went to the front. The score was 857
miles 5 laps for the leaders. Without
any warning at 10:55 Babcock cut loose
and before either the crowd or riders
knew what had happened he was some
distance ahead of the bunch and at "the
end of three laps was within ten feet of
the rear guard. None of the men made
serious efforts to catch the runaway.
The scores at the fiftieth hour, the day's
finish, were: McEachern (leading), Kaser
Stinson, Downey. Fischer, McLean and
Walthour all 928.5, Babcock 928.1, Muller
918.3.
In the last mile McLean and Walthour
fell, but neither was seriously hurt.

NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â All indications are
that Nevada will soon. figure prominently
in a pugilistic way. Reports from Carson
City, where the Legislature is now in ses
sion, show that the law legalizing prize
fights will not be repealed, and that
"Dan" Stuart, who is now in that city,
is already making arrangements for a big'
pugilistic carnival for, next spring. One
of the attractions Stuart has in mind is u
battle for the heavy-weight championship
of the world -between the winner of -the
Jeftries-Ruhlin flght and Bob Fitzsim
mons.
If Stuart succeeds in arranging the con
test it will be decided in the ring at Car
ton City, in which Fitzsimmons gained the
championship by defeating James J. Cor
bett. Lanky Bob has been quoted as say-
Ing that he will never fight again.
Stuart, however, is confident. that he can
induce Fltzsimmons to change his mind.
There are also many persons who believe
that Fitzsimmons' future pugilistic course
will depend very largely on the result -of
the issue between Jeffries and Ruhlin.
They declare that If Jeffries demonstrates
his superiority over the "Akron giant"
Fitzsimmons' retirement Is likely to - be

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â Representative
a..attuck of Ohio to-day introduced in an
amended form his resolution proposing a
Congressional Inquiry into the alleged
abridgement of the right of suffrage. The
resolution recites the right of representa
tion is denied in many of the States to
male citizens over 21 years old. In direct
violation of the fourteenth amendment to
the constitution and is an invatsion of the
rights and dignity of the House of Repre
sentatives.
The resolution further declares that
Massachusetts, Maine. Connecticut. Dela
ware. California, Louisiana, Mississippi.
North Carolina. South Carolina. Wyo
ming, Oregon and other States deny the
right to vote to certain male citizens of
full age, and that "such denial In certain
of the said States extends to more than
one-half of these, who, prior to the last
apportionment of representation, were en
titled to vote In such States."
The resolution calls for an Investigation
by a select committee of five chosen from
the Census Committee and a report within
twenty days with a bill "apportioning
membership In the House of Representa
tives based on the provisions of the four
teenth amendment to the constitution."

William Moore Claims Big
Gamblers Are Protected .
in Seattle.
Special Disnatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Jan. 4.â The trial of William
Moore, which was commenced in the Po
lice Court here yesterday, promises to de
velop sensational facts connecting the
city administration â or at any rate sev
eral prominent city officials â Â¦with the big
gambling syndicate which practically con
trols the games of chance operated in this
city. Moore was arrested by Police Cap-,
tain "Willard and charged with operating
a blackjack game in. the rear of a down
town saloon. Able counsel was engaged
for the defense and the flght already
shows startling developments. Among the
witnesses subpenaed to testify for the de
fense are Mayor Humes, Chief of Po
lice Meredith, Police Captain Wlllard and
other members of the force and every
member of the City Council. In addition,
the proprietors of four ' of the largest
gambling halls in the city are cited to
appear.
As described in recent dispatches to The
Call, gambling In every form is per
mitted in the larger resorts. Not only are
straight games operated, but every known
device for the neecing of the unwary is
tolerated.
Moore claims that his arrest was at the
instigation of leading gamblers, who re
sent any encroachment upon the field of
operations they have been permitted by
the city authorities to establish. The
hearing has made slow progress, as every
effort of the defense is concentrated to
develop the fact that. a combination of
big gamblers exists and is in league with
certain of the city officers. This course
of evidence was stubbornly fought by. the
City Attorney, most of whose objections
were supported by Police Judge Cann.
himself a city appointee and just now
seeking reappolntment from Mayor
Humes. . â¢ . vit
Police Captain Willarif? was called to
the stand, and while not permitted to give
much testimony, he was subjected to a
personal excoriation by Moore's Â¦ attor
ney, who demanded that Wlllard, jit the
arrest of Moore were in the interest of
morality, should forthwith arrest every
member of the gambling fraternity in the
city. It was' made evident that the city
officers will resist every effort to show
that they are protecting the big gamblers,
but Moore Is now after revenge, and while
he expects to be found guilty in the Po
lice Court, he will take the case to the
higher tribunals and give the city' ad
ministration and gambling combine an
airing.'

DAN STUART. PROMOTER OF PRIZEFIGHTS, â¢ WHO IS CREDITED
WITH BEING THE PRIME MOVER IN THE SCHEME TO ESTABLISH
- A STATE LOTTERY IN NEVADA.
Bâ â ETTTEEN eplashes of bllndln?
mud and an almost incessant
downpour of rain, the favorite
players at Oakland yesterday
were almost swamped. Four first
choices were mired and there was scarce
ly a chance to tell whether through bad
rides or not- If a horse got away from
the poet poorly and happened to have a
timid rider on his back, the wager was
lost then and there. The longest priced
Â¦winner of the afternoon was The Buf-.
Joon, which won the fourth event at odds
of 25 to 1, well ridden by Phelan.
The shortest priced one to reach the
Â¦wire first was Fred Foster'6 crack mud
lark Lennep. The Candlemas mare had
Bill Garrett and Gonfalon to beat and
tvent to the post T to 10. Gonfalon was
sever in it. but Bill made his usual game
bid for the long end of the coin. He did
â¢well, but there was no holding Lennep
when O'Connor shook her up a furlong
from the stand and she won by a length.
Harry Thatcher was passed about as a
certain winner of the first event, until it
really eeensed too good a thing. One or
two books were caught out of line and
laid ZT to 1 against Caesar's Young's geld
ing, though the market price was â¬. Every
thing turned out all rijrht. however.
Mounce beat the barrier with Thatcher,
ar.u In a drive at the finish led Buchanan
en Foul Play, the favorite, out half n
length. Orpheus, a 30 to 1 shot, ran third.
After some decidedly nervcus fluctuations
Alicia closed favorite over Key del Ban
didos for the first mile and seventy yard
telling run. O'Connor had the leg up on
the mare, and in front for the last six
furlongs downed Spike over a length.
Bandldoe made a poor showing, failing
to get any part of it.
Farther down on the card was another
event at the same distance with a field
of eight starting. Cyril at first had the
call, but Â¦was. in no demand and went
back to 7 to 2. T?:^n there was a play
cn Mary Kinsella. making the mare equal
favorite with Cyril. At the start Phelan
skimmed away in the lead ajid never
headed, eplashed in over a length in ad
vance cf Sam Howard.
For son-.e reason or other everybody
eeemÂ»d determined to beat Gibraltar, cne
of five starters for the fifth number over
elx furlor.g-s. Sam Hildreth/s big horse
openefi at 2, went to 4 and then went out
end made, a show cf his company. Mo
corito took the place from Prestidigita
tor, while Pompino, backed to favoritism,
ran fourth.
Once more the Schorr stable furnishe-J
f.t. even money choice, with the custom
ary result. Greenock came out in the
f.r.Rl eeven furlong run. and getting away

The public, especlaJly the. ring-going
part of it. Is most anxious to- know Just
what Dan Stuart Intends to do In the pro
motion of big fights. Well, they will
keep â¢ guessing as far as Stuart is con
cerned. In nonchalant fashion he prom
ises thÂ« best of everything. This Is much
unlike him. In 1897, when Stuart arranged
for the Fitzslmrr.ons-Corbett fight, he first
sent out a representative. The fight talk
of big Dan Stuart seems much like a veil
to cover some other gamÂ© he has up hl3
sleeve.
During the brief time he was visible at
the Palace Stuart was approached and
asked If it were true that he had been in
Nevada in the Interest of the scheme for
a lottery to be legalized by State legisla
tive franchise.
This he denied, going back immediately
to the fight talk and all the great men ha
would bring out some time in May or
June. Enough nstic giants were enume
rated to nil a dozen rings with matches for
half a year. There was nobody of notÂ©
quite out of it.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Jan- 4.â Jeffries

The local authorities are being sounded
as to whether there Is a law in the Stata"

thought that a permit for just one cham

has never been any great trouble in pull

then for political reasons.

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
f-^iEPRESENTATIVE GLYNN of New York
I- â S has revived an old and much discussed issue by
a bill providing for changing the date of in
auguration from March 4 to some day in April or
May. It will be remembered Senator Hoar introduced
a similar bill in 1898 and it was favorably recom
mended by the Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections, but never got any further. Nearly every
one in Washington approves the proposition, for
early March is always an inclement season in that
locality, and serious inconveniences attend inaugura
tion ceremonies on' account of the weather.
While no one can have any strong objection to the
plan, it is not likely to be carried so long as it stands
alone. A considerable force is necessary in a country
so conservative as ours to amend the constitution,
and a mere proposal'to change the date of inaugura
tion is too slight to arouse the interest required to
effect it. The weather in Washington is not a matter
that appeals to the country at large. It may be dis
agreeable to be inaugurated in March, but no one has
ever been known to decline the Presidency on that
account. Consequently so long as the change is
suggested in a bill by itself it will hardly be able to
command the required votes in Congress and in the
State Legislatures to make it successful.
There would be a. better chance- if it were united
with other reforms of a similar character. One of
these is the date of thc meeting of Congress. At the
present time the terms of Congress and of the Presi
dent do not harmonize very well. Cleveland has
pointed out that fact in his recent statement "that of
the four sessions of Congress held during a Presi
dential term two are so brief as to scarcely permit the
passage of necessary appropriation bills, while of the
others one occurs when the President is usually
strange in his new office and burdened with importu
nities and labors inseparable from a change of admin
istration, and the remaining one encounters during
its continuance the interruptions, timidity and .de
moralization of a Presidential and Congressional can
vass. These conditions suggest the scant opportunity
allowed for the initiation and adoption of new and im
portant remedial legislation during a single Presiden
tial term." ,'
Cleveland advises an extension of the Presidential
term to get rid of the difficulty, but it is doubtful if at
the present time the people would consent to, such a
constitutional change. There would, hpwever, be
but little objection to a plan which would fix the
date of inauguration early in May and have Congress
meet at the same time, so that all preliminary work
could be disposed of before the summer* holiday?.
There would then be two long winter terms for
each Congress in which to transact business. Such a
plan would at any rate offer the people something
more than a mere weather problem, and therefore
would be more likely to arouse the interest necessary
to its passage.
THE INAUGURATION DATE.
IN an address to the recent meeting of the Waters
and Forests Society Mr. William H. Mills called
attention to the waste of timber in the cutting of
young trees for Christmas trees. " In the cities of this
State a great many thousands of fine, straight and
beautiful sugar pines and redwoods are destroyed
every year for that purpose. The final value of each
tree, when ripe for the ax and at its full maturity,
would be, at present prices, about $30. At the fu
ture price that it would bear at maturity its value
would probably be double that. So the present gener
ation, to gratify a sentimental custom, is robbing a
future generation of S6c in every tree that it destroys
for this purpose, to contribute to the pleasures of an
hour.
Mr. J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska, the founder of
Arbor day in this country, and one of the most intel
ligent dendrologists in the world, says that: "For
Christmas trees this year Maine shipped out four
hundred carloads of young evergreens. Each car con
tained two hundred bundles and each bundle six beau
tiful trees, which fifty years hence would become use
ful lumber for human homes and their embellishment.
Four hundred times two hundred bundles of six trees
each in a half century would make lumber enough to
build hundreds of commodious cottages. The four
hundred carloads of Christmas trees from Maine ag
gregate four hundred and eighty thousand trees. This
i^rt of extravagant idolatry of a custom which does
l:ttle good and much harm ought to be abolished."
It is evident that the summer fires are not the only
destructive agency that is eating up our forests.
The children of the present, in a holiday pleasur*,
r.re taking shelter away from the children of the fu
ture.
At the rate of ten full-grown trees per acre, ths
timber crop was destroyed on 48.000 acres in Maine
for the supply of one year. With no increase in the
rate of destruction, that means the stripping of two
million four hundred thousand acres of their forest in
the next fifty years for thc same purpose. This cus
tom comes to uÂ« from Northern Europe, and is prob
ably the survival and destructive transformation of
finit old custom of the Druids. They, however.
treated the forests a? their temples and did not kill a
tree to serve as a sacrifice on the altar of their adora
tion of a sylvan deity. . .
Down to us, through the ages, comes a gentle voice,
crying, Consider the lilies, how they grow, and He
r.oteth the fall of a sparrow. In this State, when we
destroy the forests we are killing the lily and hushing
the. song of the bird. We axe so disturbing the
equilibrium of nature &s to replace the garden with the
desert. We are robbing the future of its heritage and
sre going contrary to every sentiment for which
Christmas stands. It it not then rather desecration
than consecration of that day to butcher trees and
bring them into the circle of its associations?
Â¦ We believe it is Hans Christian Andersen who has
Â¦written the fable of the Christmas tree. It ought to he
in thf school readers and have a place in the literature
of forestry. The fabulist was familiar with the forests
of the north. \V e do not know that the motive of hii
fable was their rescue from this Christmas day slaugh
ter, but one who has read it will hardly be able to cat
i Christmas tree or use one without a sense of guilt
snd a feeling of shame.
COSTLY CHRISTMAS TREES
BRITISH comments upon the prospects of the
new century were not so buoyant and cheerful
as those expressed .in this country. It would
hardly be accurate to call them pessimistic, but cer-
I tainly they evinced none of the hearty optimism that
j prevails here. From 6uch reports of them as come
i to us they appear to have been in the main serious
j and thoughtful discussions of the conditions of thc
I empire, dealing more with the evils of the time than
! with probable benefits to come.
In nearly all of these discussions much attention
was given to the trade and commerce of Great Brit
ain and to the keen competition of the United States.
It is known that American manufacturers are fuf
i nishing goods not only for India, Africa and other
British colonies, but for the people of Great Britain
i itself, and the question that perplexes the leaders of
: that country is that of the effect such competition will
have in depressing British industry and weakening
the empire.
It will be remembered that several authorities on
the Continent have attributed our success in invading
i the European market with manufactured goods to
j the economic advantages we possess in the way of
cheap and abundant coal, and raw materials of all
kinds. These authorities have suggested the organi-
I zation of a concert of Europe to establish a general
I tariff for the purpose of shutting out American
products. The British press has not taken that view
of the subject. It attributes our success mainly to thÂ»
'â¢ possession of superior machinery and more energetic
l men, and argues that we are surpassing all rivals in
the industrial field by the simple plan of doing more
efficient work.
A writer for the London Times says: "The choice
given to youth is the chief secret of the amazing en
terprise exhibited by the American steel trada
during the last dozen years," and by way of proving
I the assertion adds* that in this country "at the head
j of great affairs are young men., Youth gets there a
position which is supposed here to belong to long
experience. Men of thirty control concerns which.
here would seem to be the prerogative of men of
fifty."
Youthful energy, however, is not sufficient in itself
to account for our superiority, and in commenting
upon the statements made by its correspondent tht
Times adds, editorially: "In an analysis of ths
causes at work advene to England something should
be' said of the great Intelligence and real put into ai
fairs by the American man of business. He takes his
pleasure in what he is doing and is not afraid to ad
mit that he is in pork or in grain if the fact be so.
He is curious as to all that affects his business, and
he is open to new ideas in a way which is unusual with
u$. 'What has succeeded in the past will not succeed
in the future' is a working maxim with the best men
of business, who are ready to throw their experience
as well as their antiquated machinery on the scrap
heap."
Another factor-in the problem is set forth by thi
London Spectator in the assertion that not only are
mr captains of industry more efficient than those in
Great Britain, but that the rank and file of the work
ers are better. It is asserted that under the influence
of trades unions in the United Kingdom the British
workingmen do not exert themselves "to render an
honest equivalent for their wages." The Spectator
adds: "We believe if a deputation of British trad-s
unionists of the best type were to visit America and
conduct a thorough investigation of trade conditions
there they would return convinced that their duty to
their countrymen in .future "would be best discharged
by encouraging the universal practice of the best and
hardest work compatible with health during recog
nized working hours."
It is to be noted-both papers close with the declara
tion that there are signs, of better things to come.
The Tirr.es says. the younger business men of the
country are taking more interest in their work and
are breaking away from the conservatism of the past;
while the Spectator believes the . workingmen" will
learn the folly of doing as little instead of as much
work as possible, and that hereafter they will be more

UNDER THE CAPTION, "HASTENING THE INEVITABLE," THE ST.
LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRAT PICTURES THE PRESENT PLIGHT OF
THE DEMOCRACY ON A SEA OF TROUBLES.
PUBLIC MONEY AND THE BflNKS.
ECRETARY GAGE in a recent address to the
bankers of Ntw York suggested that the Gov
ernment impose an interest charge on deposits
of public money in national banks. He is
quoted as saying that in looking over the records of
the Treasury Department he had found that the sur
plus over and above a fair working balance averaged
$56,000,000 during the past thirty-two years. Had the
money been placed with the banks at 2 per cent the
Government would be $32,000,000 better off than it is.
The suggestion brings up an issue which ought to
have been settled long ago. Periodically there is an
outbreak of denunciation of the practice of depositing
money with "pet banks." Charges of offenses of that
kind have been made ?.gainst every administration for
at least twenty years. In no instance has a serious
scandalbeen fastened on any Secretary of the Treas
ury, and yet each of them one after another in select
ing banks to receive the Government deposits has un
questionably chosen banks whose officials were
friendly to the administration. Out of these recurring
charges there has repeatedly arisen a demand that
Congress devise some means of putting an end to the
practice, and yet up to this time nothing has been
done.
The statement of Secretary Gage as to the amount
of money available for such deposits shows how vast
is the ffevor the Government has it in its power to
bestow, and so long as that power continues there
will be always more or less talk about "pet banks,"
and more or less suspicion that the deposits arc
granted in return for political favors. A surplus
which has averaged $50,000,000 for so long a period is
certainly one that "should be dealt with upon some
plan fixed by law, and should not be ltft to' the dis
posal of the Secretary of the Treasury, no matter
how honest he may be:
It is to the credit of our statesmen that despite thc
large sums they have in this way to deposit with such
tanks as they choose not one of them has ever been
so much as suspected of making a personal profit
out of it The utmost that has ever been charged
even in political campaigns is that they have made
the deposits in return for contributions to campaign
funds, and those charges have never had the least
verification. The evil of the situation, then, is not due
to any wrongdoing on the part of any official, but to
the system itself. It should not be left to the option of
any man to determine where so large a sum is to be
deposited, or when it is to be withdrawn.
It is for the financiers of the Government to decide
what plan should be adopted to remedy the evil. The
suggestion that interest be" charged is a good ont,
for that would be at least an improvement upon thc
present system. To lend $50,000,000 at 2 per cent in
terest would not be so great a favor as to make a de
posit of that amount without interest at all, but even
that would not wholly satisfy the demands of the pub
lic. What is desired is a system of handling surplus
money in the treasury in such a*way that there will be
no more talk about pet banks, and it is strange Con
gress has so long delayed in enacting one.

Union of the New York Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union, Mrs. Anna Hat
field sounded a note of warning against
the kiss. She ventured the opinion that
a kissing Is about tho worst thing that
can happen to a young girl, provided the
kisser is a young mart The doctor has
been Investigating and finds that the
amount of hugging and kissing the daugh
ters of our best families submit to la a
menace to our national morality. One
young man has tola the good doctor that
he rarely leaves a young lady without
kissing her good night, and when he has
been about to omit the" ceremony some of
them have Insisted upon it. A young
man who /will kiss and tell will lie about
it, and the good doctor should vit placs
implicit confidence In the stories auch
young men tell her: nevertheless, the
older we grow the more we axe inclined
to believe there Is entirely too much oscu
lation among the young folks. Years
ago It was different.â Minneapolis Times.
Is Kissing Intoxicating?
Professor I>oeb of the University of

As for being "without fear," It Is one
thing to be judiciously brave and quita
another to play the part of a bull In a
china shop. "A newspaper that will lead
public opinion" i.Â« a noble thing, provided
it leads opinion nobly. It may be no. less
a leader and yet may debauch public opin
ion. We suppose there is no paper of any
importance that do^s not lead opinion In
some extent. Xelther is there any that
does not to some extent consult and re
flect public opinion. The newspaper
should not be a senile follower. Xelther,
in these days of wide reading and Infer
mation, is It priggishly to pose as an In

THE Republican party of this State will render
to itself and the State a conspicuous service by
enucleating Nucleus Kelly.; In politics he is a
contractor. His contract with candidates is never a
nudum pactum. He never forgets the consideration.
A Republican House does not want to begin busi
ness by selecting a broker.
The coolness with which Kelly assumes that the
country member* arc so little equipped for their duty
and so little qualified for the office they hold that in
| the discharge of its very first function, the organiza
â¢ tion of the House, they wait for his cue, is an insult
to their intelligence as Republicans and men.
They know their duty; they are picked men, se
lected by the communities they represent because their
neighbors saw in them fitness and adaptation to the
honorable office they fill, and they will not inscribe
their record with incompetency by acknowledging
I their dependence upon a "nucleus" churned into form
by Martin Kelly.
The Call believes them qualified and capable and
would insult them by assuming to the contrary. We
have no candidate for the Speakership, nor for any
other office in this State nor under the sun. We have
no desire except to maintain the decency and dignity
of the Republican party and increase thereby its power
as an instrument for the public good.
Does any one pretend that Nucleus Kelly repre
sents its decency o.- its dignity, its worth, or its power
for the public welfare?
If he is to own the Speaker and the House, we shall
insist that in the next campaign he shall go upon the
stump in behalf of his property interest in the party.
We shall insist that the constituents of the country
r'embers shall 6ee this maker of combinations
|and nuclei, that they may note his impressive pres
i ence. his dignified bearing, his culture, and the pro
i fundity of his knowledge of public issues and party
principles!
J To send out trained students of affairs to represent
Republicanism to the people, to discuss principles,
â¢ avow the high purpose of the party and so secure a
vast majority for its ticket, and then turn over all of
its power to this low-browed boss, is to play a confi
j dence game on the public We desire to rescue the
j party from such a situation. If it is not done, then we
I insist that this squat and warty political toad, the
idol of a debased push in this city, shall be exhibited
to the State as the real leader of the party, representa-

American republic, where there exists per
fect equality of political privilege and per
fect freedom of speech, and where, with
every man eligible for the highest office,
every man is to some extent a politician
or at least a critic, there must naturally
be an abundance of political satire.
America from the very first has been ex
ceedingly prolific in this variety of humor.
Office-holders and lawmakers have been
regarded as legitimate prey, and nave
ever been unmercifully lampooned and
satirized. Even the President must en
dure a continuous fire of . criticism and
eatlre and caricature.
American political satire In Its modern
form originated with Seba Smith, who in
January, 1S30, began a series of letters to
the Portland Courier under the pseudo
nym of .Major Jack Downing. A bitter
struggle was in progress In the Maine
Legislature, the forces were equally divid
ed and each claimed to have elected its
Governor. Smith, who was 'â¢ then editor
of the Courier, conceived the truly Tankeo
Idea of reviewing the situation at frequent
intervals from the standpoint of a shrewd
but unsophisticated country boy, who has
come to town fresh from the backwoods
with a load of axhandles, cheese, "apple
sass" and "footings," and who stumbles
quite Innocently into the heated Legisla
ture. His homely lette*^ to his Uncle
Joshua, a rural politician of great zeal.
and to his Cousin Ephralm, and the let
ters in return from all nls relatives, are
full of real fun, of shrewd common sense
and skillful characterization. The letters,
though of a local nature, were soon wide
ly read and widely copied.
At this point the series was taken up by
a young New York author, Charles Augus
tus Davis, and carried far beyond the or
iginal Intention of Smith. Davis enriched
the character of Jack Downing and added
new elements of fun.
The young politician. Downing, became
at once a national figure. He Is nomin
ated for Governor of Main*, but. notwith
standing that he polls the entire vote of
Downingville, Is overwhelmingly defeat
ed. His candidacy, however, has mads
him known, and he now aspires to na
tional honors. Hearing that several of
Jackson's Cabinet have resigned, he starts
post haste for Washington.
"I think," he writes his uncle, "It's the
duty of all true republlkans that have thÂ«
good of the country at heart to taka hold
and help the President along In these try
ing difficulties. For my part, I am per
fectly willing to take one of the offices,
and I hope some other good men will come
right forward and take the others. What
a shame 'twas that them are Secretaries
should all clear out and leave the poor
old general to do all the work alone. Why,
uncle, they had no more patriotism than
your old hoss."
But on his arrival the President declared
"that they had got him into such a hobble
about them are offices that he couldn't
give me onÂ© of 'em if hÂ© was to die." But
he secured for him a captaincy in thÂ©
army and sent him to fight the British in
the Aroostook war. After a glorious and
bloodless campaign he returns to Wash
ington, becomes confidential adviser to
the President, helps mightily with his
counsel during the nullification difficulty
and the struggle with the national banks,
and later plunges with vigor Into the
Mexican war, which he lights up marvel
ously with his luminous correspondence
from the front. During the rest of his
career until Just before the opening of
the civil war he is ever at thÂ© storm can
ter of national politics.
These letters, published complete in 1859
under the title "My Thirty Years Out of
the Senate," ara running over with home
ly wisdom, with shrewd observation, with
comlo incident and Illustration. No satires
were ever more popular. Political parti
sans forgot their hostility and Joined to
gether in good-humored laughter over the
shrewd speculations and grotesque adven
tures of Major Jack Downing. Nothing
grows stale more quickly than satire, yet
these homely letters, with their broad
; studies of human nature and their care
; ful characterizations, are still fresn and
readable. Uncle Joshua, for illustration,
in an argument with the major estimates
' that in -1851 there were twenty political
parties north of Mason and Dixon's line.
" '"Weil, now,' says Uncle Joshua, 'how do
you euDpose we are going to work to make a
President, with all these parties in the field,
flghtln'' cross-handed and every which wayT
" 'I'm sure I can't see,' says I. 'unless we
can get up a party that will surround the whole
of 'em. as the Irish corporal surrounded the
half a dozen prisoners.'
" 'What do you think of Mr. Oalhoun's plan.'
said Uncle Joshua, 'that's laid down in his
works. Just published?'
-" "What" * that?' says I. "I don't think Tv*
heard of it.'
" 'Well, says he, *he recommends to choose
two Presidents, one for the North and one for
the South â each side of Mason and Dixon's
line; and no law of Consreos to become a law
till it is signed by both Presidents. How think
you it will work?*
" 'Well, I guess,' Bays I. If the country de
pended upon laws to lire on it would starve to
death vs sure as the ass between two bundles
of hay.'
"At that Cousin Nabby ipok* nn. and says
she: 'Mora like the country would be like a
bundle of hay between two asses, and would
get eat up pretty quirk.'
"Uncle Joshua, says he, looking veiy sober.
'Come, come, Nabby, you hush up; what do
you know about polities?* Thereupon he be
gins to expound with vigor Calhoun'a proposi
tion. - â¢ '
"Uncle Joshua laid his pip* down, and I see
that he was In arnest. and Aunt Kezlah laid
i her nit tin" down, for ah* seÂ« he waa in arnest,
too."
The followers of Seba Smith have been
well nigh countless. The most prominent
have doubtless been Robert H. Newell,
who was prominent during the Civil War
period under the pseudonym "Orpheus C.
Kerr." and David Ross Locke, who was
widely known during thÂ© war and the
reconstruction era under thÂ© pseudonym
"Petroleum V. Nasby." The latest prom
inent member of this group Is our own
Mr. Dooley.
Â» "Naaby" was flouTrtlees thÂ© greatest
newspaper satirist that America has yet
produced, yet he deserves not the same
consideration as Seba Smith/ since in
reality he took up the pen that Smith laid
down. There is more of the merely comlo.
more of horseplay and straining after
effect in "Nasby" than in "Jack Down
ing." "Nasby" is represented as being an
Illiterate Kentucky backwoodsman who
poses as a reformer and as an "office
seeker." His ' spelling Is grotesque, his
morals are exceedingly questionable, he
stands for all that is sordid and low In
American politics. In his shameful po
litical Ideals, which hÂ© exposed with un
blushing: candor; In his selfishness and
sensuality and unscrupulous schemes he
brought to light the more latent evils of
American politics, and his influence was
considerable. He was a reformer on the
principle laid down by Pope, that "vie*),
to be Dated, needs but to be seen." Lin
coln and many of his counselors delighted
in Nasby, and all classes of readers in
the North read him with great glee.
There is not the human touch, thÂ©
shrewd characterization, thÂ© careful study
of personality in "Nasby" that there is in
"Jack Downing." There is more clown
lahness and more rant. TakÂ». for Instance,
his letter written durlnjr thÂ© agitation In
Congree* of nefrro suffrage:
"Th* die Is cast! The gnilloteen he* fallen]
I am . r.o longer postmaster at Confedrlt X
Roads, wlch Is In the State uv Kentucky. Tho

idrnt to "lottry managers and extraetln* the
sweets therefrom: a nlejrer will beâ but I
couldn't dwell upon the dlsgustln* them* no
longer."
There is a deeper satire in Nasby than
in Jack Downing. "In him." says Rich
ardson,"w se* vicious and low political
"motives stripped of their pretense*, and
therefore we recognize a figure that points
a moral as well as raises a l.iueh. Nasny.
in a very different field, resemble* Low^n
in piercing to the heart of sham and mak
ing that heart reveal Its own baseness."
Thus naturally we come to Lowell, the
rreatest of American satirists, and one of
the few undisputed American humorists
of the first rank.
LoweU> prreat contribution to th* lit
erature of political satire waÂ« the "Blir
low Papers." the first neries of which w*Â»
directed against the Mexican war and the
second series of which was aimed at slav
ery and thÂ© Issues brought forth by thÂ©
civil war. The paper*, which are written
in verÂ«Â«Â». are represented as being the po
etic product of a crude country lad of the

Thumps, bumps, creak*, scratching*, rap*â till.
"Zounds t"
Cried Knott. "this goe* beyond all bounds.
I do not deal In tongue* and Bounds."
So full was Lowell of wit and fun that
It bubbled out even In his most serious
pieces of literary criticism. Who would
expect to laugh qver a scholarly review
of the poetry and the influence of the po*t
Gower? Yet note how the genial critic
handles his verse:
Oower baa positively raised tedtousnes* to tha
precision of a science, he has made dullness an
heirloom for the studenta of our literary his
tory. As you allp to and fro on the frozen
levels of his verse. wh!ch give no foothold to

Tou learn to dread, almost to respect, th*
powers of this indefatigable man. H* is ths
undertaker of thm fair medieval legend. â¢ â¢ â¢
Our literature had to lie by and recruit for
more than four centuries before It could glvÂ»
us an equal vacuity In Tupper.
Who but Lowell can make the dry ami
learned field of literary criticism a prov
ince of the humorous and the witty?
Lowell is predominatingly a satirist and
a wit. Much of his laughable work is
from the head rather than the heart, but
he was nevertheless a true humorist. Ha
waa full of sympathy and human kind
ness; ha knew l&tlmattly human nature
and human life, and despite his frequent
sarcasm he wu never bitter nor pessimis
tic save in the presence of positive evil.
Genuine love of humanity breathes Â» from
even the fiercest of hi3 "Blglow Papers."
and In many of the* poef s minor lyrics
it rises to true pathos. Had Lowell writ
ten nothing but "The Courtin' " he would
still rank as a great humorist. There can
be no mort fitting close for a study of hU
peculiar typÂ« of humor, with its trutn
to nature. Its perfect natoraJness, Its ten
<lerneÂ«9, its wit, its beauty, than a few
stanzas from this perfect lyric:

heightened by the learned comments of
the erudite Parson Wilbur and the broad

This Is good fan, as Is much of tha
poem that follows. Such stanzas as this
are a simple mixture of the merely cooaio
with shrewd Yankee wisdom:
Jest eo horn* and ask oar Ka&ay
'Whether I'd be seen a cooeÂ«

The etarnal bane was loose!
She wants me fer home consumptlfltv
Let alone tha hay's to mowâ
Kf you're arter folks o* gumption.
You're a darned long row to to*.
But mingled with tho fun are bnrsts of
true humor. One does not have to read
far to realize that the author of these
rollicking verses was deeply stirred; that
his heart was full for his suffering fellow
men; that he was putting a message that
was to make mankind better and wiser
and more gentle Into a homely dress that
it mignt reach a wider area of humanity.
It is Lowell himself who speaks In stan
zas like these;
E* fer war, Z Â«â¢Â«?! It nrar&srâ
There, you hev it plain and fiat!
I don't want to go no furder

1 These papers, with their wonderful
wealth of humor In all of its phases, are
the hlg-hwater marks of American polit
ical satire. "No speech, no plea." says
George William Curtis, "no appeal waa
comparable in popular and permanent ef
fort with this pitiless twnpest of fire and
hall, in tha form of wit. argument, satire,
knowledge, insight, learning, common
sense and patriotism. It wa* humor of
tho purest strain, but humor In deadly
earnest In its course, as In that of a
cyclone. It swept all before itâ the press.
the church, criticism, scholarshipâ and It
bore resistlesÂ»ly down upon tha Mexican
war, the pleas for slavear, the> congres
sional debates."
As a wit and a punster Lowell has had
no American equal save Holmes. His
"Fable for Critics" Is a mixture of rolliclc-
Jn*r fun. of puns and laughable rhymes
and sound criticism. In his poem, *'The
Unhappy Lot of Mr. Knott/ T hÂ» shows
himself the equal of Hood as a wit and a
punster. Pun* in every form, half-con
cealed, boldly prominenC unheard-of com
binations, often seemingly unpremeditated
and spontaneous, confront thÂ© reader In
every stanza, Mr. Knott would build a
house In the "two-door style," and thus
ha soliloquizes:
A pocket-roll of rocks 'twoald take
To build a house of freestone,
But then it Is not bard to make
What nowadays is the stone;
The canning painter in a trie*
Tour houses outside pe trifles.
And people think it very gneiss
Without inquiring deeper;
My money never shall be thrown
Away on such a deal of stone,
When stone of deal are cheaper.
He was not wholly satisfied, after his
house was completed, to find that
Tempests, with petrifio ahock
So to speak, made it really rock.

to the necessity for further legislation
amending the act to regulate commerce,
the reasons for urging these amendments
having been carefully explained in pre
vious reports. Knowledge of present con
ditions and tendencies, It says, increases
rather than lessens thÂ» necessity for
legislative action . on the lines already
Indicated and In such other directions aa
will furnish an adequate and workable
statute for the regulation of commerce
among the several state*.
"It is evident," the report says, "that
railroad managers generally have made
no. attempt to conform their practices to
the spirit of the law. p They may keep
within its letter and succeed In avoiding
Its penalties, but they claim that they are
virtually compelled to counteract its aim
and evade Its observance. Thus it hap
pens that some of the most Important and
useful - incidents of . railway service are
maintained by methods wnich axÂ© believed
to be inharmonious with, if not In actual
violation of, the Federal statute. This Is
more than the question of pooling con
tracts between rival carriersâ It is the
question - of such agreements as . relate
to classification, terminal charges and the
likeâ concerning -'which uniformity, cer
tainty . and stability are of . manifest
benefit and convenience to the public.
"Under thÂ« conditions Â¦ now existing . It
is inevitable that frequent discriminations
should occur and endless acts of injustice
be committed. : Theoretically It Â¦ is pos
sible for each road to observe Its pub
lished schedule* in every particular, but
this in many cases must be done. If don*
at all, only at the loss of needed traffic,
unless all rival roads with, equal strict
ness and honesty conform in like manner
to their published .rates. The idea of
public regulation implies .certain stand
ards of correct conduct to which all carÂ»
riers should conform. ' It also implies
some measure of supervision and control
over those subject to Its requirements; -to
the end that those standards may be ob
served- and practices made to conform
thereto.' Thiis, without doubt. Is Incon
sistent to some degree at least with ac
tual and' constant competition as ' that
term is commonly. understood. . .
"The policy now pursued cannot and
will not prevent an outcome of vicious dis
crimination. And what .13 , most unfor
tunate of all, Â« those discriminations favor
the few and place ; the many at a disad
vantage,- They aid the strong, who hava
no need of assistance, and heap the weak
with burdens which,- by comparisons, are
always unjust and often destructive.
RECEIVES BOX
OF DYNAMITE
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â For five hours
to-day the Senate discussed the army re
organization bill. The debate took a wide
range at times, but was confined prin
cipally to the necessity for the Increase in
the regular army proppsed in the pend
ing measure. The Philippine question was
threshed over at great length, but few
really r.ew points were advanced.
Some slight progress was made toward
the completion of the pending measure.
Jones of Arkansas offered a resolution
directing the Committee on Military Af
fairs to inquire upon what alleged facts
the charges against Major Heistand of
the United States army by Erastus L.
Hawkes are based, and report to the Sen
ate. He said the charges made by Hawkes
against Major Heistand were matters of
common knowledge to newspaper readers.
An army officer had been removed because
of some "alleged bad conduct. The charges
indicated that the army officer who re
mained in the service was as guilty as
he who was removed. If so, he ought to
be removed, too. The resolution was re
ferred to the Committee on Military Af
fairs.
The resolution offered "by Pettlgyew call
ing for information with reference to the
Philippines was referred to the Commit
tee on the Philippines, after a speech by
Pettigrew, who said the President main
tained there was no war in the Philip
pines. The military committee declared
that war existed there and that at least
tiO.OOO men would be required to suppress
the rebellion.
"As the President and the military com
mittee disagree," eaid Pettigrew, "it
stems to me we ought to have the facts
before we create an army of 100,000 men."
He hoped the resolution would not be
sent to "that graveyard, the Philippine
Committee," but it was so referred.
Another of Pettigrew's resolutions, call
ing upon the President for information
as to ihe necessity for an increase in the
strength of the army, was referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs.
The army bill was then taken up, and
Carter asked unanimous consent that the
unobjected committee amendments in the
bill be considered and passed upon.
Pettigrew objected, declaring that as his
efforts to obtain information irom the reg
ular channels had been thwarted, he pro
posed to have time to obtain it In some
other way.
Wellington of Maryland demanded to
knew the intention of the administration
with reference to the Philippine Islands.
If it was to force an annexation of the
Philippines, then a large army would be
necessary. He declared the country had
been assured at the beginning of the Phil
ippine trouble that it could be put down in
hve or six weeks, yet the situation was
worse than ever.
"Those people cannot be put down,"
declared Wellington. "Is it the purpose
of the administration to deprive them of
self-government? If so, 1 am opposed
to any such infamy."
Carter said the pith of Wellington's
question was that the administration, to
ratisfy him, must declare its present and
future policy with respect to the Philip
pints. "The Senator can consult the rec
ord of Congress for an answer to his
question," said Carter. The President has
no authority to decide what shall be done
with the Philippines. The moment the
treaty of peace was ratified, that moment
it became the supreme law of the land. If
the President had refused to maintain the
sovereignty of the United States there, he
would have laid himself liable to impeach
ment."
"Has he not already given up sover
eignty over a portion of Alaska?" Inquired
Wellington.
Carter replied that what the President
had done as to the Alaskan boundary
had been accomplished through a modus
Vivendi, a purely temporary arrangement.
"It is nevertheless a fact," declared
Wellington, "that territory over which we
had undisputed sovereignty has been
abandoned. The British ttag has been
raised over it. That is the fact."
Carterâ That is the alleged fact only.
Wellington, continuing, said the Alas
kan boundary was distinctly marked by
stones and the territory acquired by tho
United States from Russia was clearly
the territory of the United States. He
said that if the President should be Im
peached if he relinquished territory In the
Philippines, he should likewise be im
peached for relinquishing sovereignty In
Alaska.
"Dou you approve of the relinquishment
of territory in Alaska?" inquired Carter.
"I do not," replied Mr. Wellington.
Carterâ Then do you approve of a re
linquifhment of the Philippines?
Wellingtonâ That is quite a different
matter.
Carter declared it was the Intention of
the United States to maintain the laws in

Lively Debate in House on
Enfranchisement of
Negroes.
SUFFRAGE BILL
IS RECOMMITTED
WASHrNGTON, Jan. 4.â ThÂ« House to
day had another, spirited struggle over
the Olmstead resolution to Investigate tba
abridgment of the suffrage In certain
Southern States with a view to reappor
tlcnment upon the actual basis of suf
frage. It was finally referred to the cen
sus committee, where the opposition de
sired it to go originally. Some of the
Republican leaders were not In sympathy
with the resolution. Olmstead tried to
get Hopkins to agree that the committee
would consider the resolution' within a
week, but the chairman of the census
committee declined to make any pledge
to that effect. The debate upon the reso
lution was marked by exceeding frank
ness. Some of the Southern members
avowed that the attempt to enfranchise
the negro had been a lamentable failure,
and the action of certain States in legally
eliminating the blacks as factors at the
polls, they said, was in the Interest of civ
ilian tion and progress. After the resolu
tion had been disposed of the rcapportlon
ment bill was taken up. An attempt to
agree upon a time for the final vote on
the bill .failed, although the general
opinion is that the debate will conclude
early next week.
Dalzell of Pennsylvania called the
House to order to-day In the absence of
Speaker Henderson, who was detained at
his home by a severe cold which he con
tracted while in New York, during the
holidays. Immediately after the ap
proval of the journal half a dozen mem
bers were on their feet .demanding recog
nition. Among them was Olmstead, who
yesterday created a stir by offering the
resolution to instruct the commltte on
census to investigate the alleged abridg
ment of the right to vote in several South
ern States. But the Speaker pro tern, first
recognized Lacey of Iowa, who presented
a privileged resolution asking the Presi
dent to return a minor bill in which there
was a clerical error. It waa adopted.
Burton of Ohio presented the river and
harbor bill. In order to clear the way for
Olmstead, Graff of Illlonis, chairman of
the Committee on Claims, after stating
that it was apparent that no claims could
be considered to-day (this being ths day
set apart under the rules for their con
sideration), asked unanimous consent to
pass the regular order for to-day until
next week.
Swanson of Virginia objected. . The
Speaker pro tem. was then about to recog
nize Olmstead' when Underwood of Ala
bama headed him off with the point of no
quorum. The House was counted and
there were only 142 members in the hall.
Under tho operation of the automatic rule
the Speaker was about to direct a call of
the House when Underwood interposed
with a motion to adjourn, and the fili
bustering was on. The vote was taken
by ayes and noes. The motion to adjourn
was defeatedâ 65 to 103. Th* Speaker pro
tem. held that the pending question was
the vote on the question of consideration
raised against the Olmstead resolution
yesterday. During the previous rollcall
the leaders on both sides had conferred
and an agreement had been reached that
the resolution should be recommitted.
Richardson, the minority leader, formally
proposed that this course be followed.
Olmstead replied that he would consider
the preposition after the House had voted
to consider the resolution.
"I may say," said he, "that it had been
my intention to follow Â» the course sug
gested by the gentleman from Tennes
see."
"Why not do so now and save time?"
asked Richardson.
But Olmstead insisted upon a vote on
the question of consideration and the roll
was called.
The House voted, 103 to 91, to consider
the resolution, whereupon Richardson
moved to recommit the resolution to the
Census Committee. Upon Richardson's
motion Olmstead demanded the previous
question and notwithstanding some dila
tory tactics by the Democrats, with as
sistance from several Republicans, the
previous question was ordered, 92 to 88.
â¢Underwood of Alabama made a warm
speech in opposition to the resolution. He
hoped, he said, that such a resolution
would not appear in the House. The real
purpose of the fourteenth amendment had
been to enfranchise the negro. It had
failed. The fifteenth amendment had been
successful for a time, but in the end it
had proved a lamentable failure. Both
amendments had been mistakes not only
to the Democratic but to the Republican
party. The time had come, now after the
bitterness of the war was over, when tho
people of the South in fairness and Jus
tice to themselves and the negro race
were trying not to oppress the negro race,
but only to protect themselves and their
property against maladministration. He
admonished his friends from the North
that they did not live among the negroes
and did not understand the problem.
"We of the South," said he, addressing
the House, "are trying to serve it faith
fully to both races, and I appeal to you
if you are in favor of upbuilding the
negro race, if you are in favor of pro
tecting the investments which the North
has sent there, to send this resolution
to a committee and let it die there."
Williams of Mississippi said that of re
cent years some of the people of thÂ«
South had listened to the siren voice of
the North that sectionalism was dead.
"There is no man who loves American
civilization," said he, "who is not glad in
his heart that by constitutional and legal
methodsâ analogous to those adopted in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and other
States â the South has solved this trouble
some and almost unsolvable problem."
Olmstead, the author of the resolution
said he did not want the resolution to
die and would move Its reference to the
Census â¢ Committee, if thÂ© chairman of
that committee would agree to call the
committee together to consider It within
onÂ© week. 1
Chairman Hopkins said ! he was not In
the mood to make a bargain to-day, but
assured Olmstead that his committee
would do lta duty.
Olmstead then made the motion to refer
and it was carried without division.
Hopkins Immediately called up the re
apportionment bill and opened the debate
In a careful explanation of his bill. HÂ«
stated that the majority of the Census
Committee favored keeping the member
ship Â¦ down to the present .' number, 357.
from considerations of economy and in
telligent legislation.
Bhafroth of Colorado wanted Hopkins
to explain how It was that Colorado
would gain one Representative under the
system adopted If the total number waa
356 or 358, but would not if it was 357
Â¦ Hopkins replied that the fact was called
years ago the "Alabama paradox." No
system, he Bald, would deal out exact
Justice to every State. The membership
waÂ« arbitrarily fixed. at 357. which made
the . basis of representation - 208,868. Di
viding the population of the States by this
divisor, 335 members were assigned. The
other 22 were assigned to those havinc
the largest majqr fractions.
The States which were opposing . th!s
bill, he eald, ; were those which lost Rep
resentatives under its operations. He
claimed . that the bill of the . minority
showed ; favoritism, to Nebraska and
Maine, each of which would lose one Rep
resentative under the basis of the figures
prepared by. the director of the census,
or a House of 856 members. Those two
members. , he eald. were - deliberately
filched by the Burleigh bill from New
York and Pennsylvania. , He declared that
a ' more unfair bill i was never presented
to the Â¦ House : than \ that fathered by the
gentleman from; Maine . (Burleigh).
The Burleigh bill, he paid, gave Maine
a Representative . for each 173,617 inhabi
tants. If this ratio were taken in New
York, Pennsylvania and Illinois, New
York would have five, Pennsylvania three
and : Illinois â¢ three ' more Representatives
than the bill allows them.
Shafroth of Colorado followed, citing
the case, of Colorado, which would get an
acltional members if the House was to
consist -of . 256 to 358. but would â¢ lose the
additional member at 857," to show that the
system upon Â¦'- which the bill was predi
cated was run Just.' Â¦v.-.-'

Debate on Army Bill Calls Forth Bitter
Denunciation of Philippine
THE SAI FRANCISCO GALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 5, 1901. â¢
7
the Philippines, to restore order and tc
protect property. Beyond that principle
Congress would determine what the ulti
mate disposition of the islands would be.
Teller of Colorado sharply criticized the
pending measure as an entering wedge for
a large standing army. "You will want
not 100,000 men," he declared, "but you
will want 200,000, and you will want them
for a hundred years. This measure Is not
intended merely to meet an emergency,
but to fix upon the country a great stand
ing army."
Teller said It would be easily possible to
pass a bill in forty-eight hours that would
provide for an army of 100,000 men or 200,
000 men for service In the Philippines, pro
vided it was made to apply to purely
emergency service and for a dcllnite lim
ited time. He attacked the Philippine
Commission now In Manila for legislating
for those in whom they had no Interest.
"The Czar of Rusfela," said he, "Is an
absolute Czar. He has a council of sixty
men who sit with him, but these men are
Russians,. They have the sympathy and
ambitions of Russians. But these Ameri
cans in the Philippines are strangers to
the' country and to the people. Under the
law they have a right to be there, but
under God's law, which Is higher, they
have no place there at all. Their actions
are the worst form of imperialism."
Caffery inquired whether in the circum
stances Teller would vote to maintain
i the authority of the United States in the
Philippines.
"As Mr. Lincoln announced in regard to
the Mexican War," replied the Colorado
Senator, "a war that he did not believe
in, he would vote for such a force as the
Government needed. So I have no doubt
that as long as our flag floats in the Phil
ippine archipelago I will (reluctant as 1
may be) vote to maintain the army and
the Hag there. If that is illotdcal. it is
illogical because there is no better way
out of it."
Proctor Eald he thought the Colorado
Senator was under a misapprehension as
to what the army bill proposes to do. A*
he regarded the matter, the maximum
force authorized by the bill was to be
used only In the present emergency, and
there would be a return to the minimum
of 4">.0O0, which was the peace footing of
the bill.
No one could tell when the troops might
bo needed in Alaska, Hawaii or Porto
Rico. Likewise there was a possibility
<Â»f the need of a larger American force
Jn Cuba at the request of the Cubans
themselves. And as for the Philippines,
no one could doubt that for a considera
ble time, ( ven if all demands should be
granted, a large force of our troops must
be kept In those islands.
/ Hoar suggested a general amendment
to the bill looking to the conciliation of
the Filipinos and expressed the opinion
that in time of peace we should have
one soldier to 1000 of our population. He
did not therefore, he said, oppose the bill
on the score of Increase, but he did oppose
it because of the avowed policy of mili
tary control of the islanda. "It Is idle,"
he said, "to tell us that these people are
not fit for self-government." He quoted
the President and naval officers to show
that the Filipinos are an intelligent peo
ple, and added: "The way to prepare
them for liberty is to set them free."
Hoar said that if the facts could be
known, there would be no two opinions
as to what we Bhould do in the
Philippines, for he believed that if tho
pcojilo were generally convinced that the
Filipinos were as capable of self-govern
ment as they are they would make no
effort to continue to subjugate those peo
ple in the interest of trade.
Hoar said that it would be most de
sirable to have appointed a commission
representing all phases of political life,
men of the highest character and stand
ing, to ascertain tho facts as to the Phil
ippines aDd make them known to Con
gress and to the people. He hoped such
a commission would be appointed before
the close of the present sess'on. We
should give the- Filipinos a hearing. He
said:
"Let them state their case. They can
come and go in peace and honor. If we
pay to the Filipinos that we will not con
eider their case until they go down on
their knees, lay their hands upon their
hips and their lips in the dust, "this war
will go on if there is a spark of spirit
and principle in their breasts until every
Filipino of one sex Is exterminated and
vntll the women among them take up the
fight and are exterminated also."
Stewart of Nevada supported the pend
ing bill. The rebellion, he declared,
should be crushed as an Indian uprising
in the West would be, and liberty and !tÂ«
blessings would be extended to the people
of the Philippines.
Caffery of Louisiana argued against the
pending bill, denouncing the creation of a
larere permanent standing army.
The Senate then devoted an hour or
more in perfecting the army bill by tho
addition of part of the committee amend
ments, to which no objection was raised.
Among the amendments- passed over for
future consideration was that relating to
the establishment of a veterinary corp*.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.-Congressman
Wadsworth of New York made a brief
statement to-day before the Senate Com
mittee on Agriculture concerning reflec
tions upon the minority report adopted on
the oleomargarine bill in the House. At
the hearing yesterday H. C. Adams, Dairy
Commissioner for the State of "Wisconsin,
and Secretary Knight , of the National
Dairy Union, stated that they were not
correctly represented in that report. Mr
Adams denied that he said that the pur
pose of the pending bill is to stop tho
manufacture and sale of Â¦ oleomargarine
entirely, but Mr. Wadsworth contended In
his statement to-day that this was his
language. He said the remark had been
taken down by a member of the commit
tee when made because of Its bluntness
He also said the letter which Mr. Knight
had pronounced a forgery was still in ex
istence and would be produced if neces
sary.
Mr. Adams reiterated his denial. Baying
he had only said that the purpose of tho
bill was to stop the manufacture and sale
of oleomargarine "colored in imitation of
butter." -
Hon. : John Hamilton, Secretary of 'Ag
rlculture of Pennsylvania, advocated the
passage of the bill, contending that the
fact that the chemical analysis of . oleo
margarine showing it to contain. the same
Ingredients - of butter 'does not render It
equally palatable and healthful. 1 He es
timated that 50 per cent of. the oleomar
garine manufactured if sold as butter and
said the farmers of Pennsylvania alone
derive an income of about $18,000,000 a year
from the butter sold by them. . - : â¢> Â¦Â¦
. Dairy Commissioner Blackburn of Ohio
said he had found it was almost impos
sible to prosecute Infractions of the oleo
margarine law In the large cities of Ohio

because of their solicitation of Jurymen'

In conformity with the decision of thÂ«
Street Committee that the blocks named
be repaved with an asphalt or bituminous
rock pavement, with a binder course and
a six-inch concrete foundation. The
board originally recommended a basalt
and cobble foundation and has been at

Street Committee, which favored the su
perior pavement. The estimated cost of
the work is $6653. The recommendation
â¢will be ratified by the Supervisors at next

City Engineer Grun9ky has estimated
the cost of reducing the sidewalk widths
on Clement street trom 19 to 15 feet and
on Division street, between Seventeenth

about 13000. If assessed to the property
owners the greatest charge would be

yf*^ R. J. H. WHITE, assistant to the
surgeon general of the United
II States, who was sent to this
, I, yJ coast to investigate the acts of
Dr. Kinyoun. head of the Fed
eral quarantine station at this port, called
on Secretary Scott of the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday and graciously con
sented to confer with the board of trus :
tees of that organization on Tuesday next.
As was stated in The Call yesterday.
Secretary Scott called at the hotel where
Dr. White was domiciled and, finding the
latter absent, left his card. This courtesy
on the part of the secretary had its effect.
Early yesterday morning Dr. White vis
ited "the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce and Introduced himself to Mr.
Scott- The visiting physician not only
expressed a desire to meet the trustees
but asked that a day might be set. so
that he might have the pleasure of their
acquaintance. Tuesday afternoon was en
tirely agreeable to Mr. White. As that
day is the annual election of the Cham
ber of Commerce,- there will no doubt be
a large number of members In attend
ance when Dr. White is formally pre
sented by the secretary.
There is no doubt that Dr. White was
directed to come to this city by reason
of the resolutions adopted by the Cham
ber of Commerce and forwarded to the
Secretary of the Treasury and other au
thorities at Washington. The resolutions
were in part as follows:
Whereas, Particular attention has been called
Resolution.
Senate Committee Acts Fa
vorably on the Lodge
WASHINGTON*, Jan. 4.â Favorable ac
tion was taken to-day by the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations on the resolu
tion previously introduced by Senator
Lodge declaring for the enactment of
laws prohibiting the sale of opium and in
toxicating liquors to the aboriginal and
uncivilized peoples of all countries and
the resolution was passed by the Senate.
The committee had before it petitions
signed by numerous individuals and asso
ciations from twenty-five States, which
were presented by the Reform Bureau.
That bureau has received the following
letter from ex-President Harrison on the
subject: *
January 1. lWl-Rev. W. F. Crafts. Wash
ingtonâMy Dear Sir: I have received your
letter of the- 2Sth and In reply I beg to say
that I have made It a rule not to sign petitions
of appeal to members of Congress for legisla
tion. I have expressed myself upon the sub
ject" In a public address In the paragraph to
which your letter refers. It does seem to me
as If the Christian nations of the world ought
to be able to make their contact with the
weaker peoples of the earth beneficent and not
destructive, and I give to your efforts to se
cure helpful legislation my warmest Fympathy.
vtry truly, BENJAMIN HARRISON.
It was claimed that one of the petitions
presented represented 10,000,000 people. It
wa<! not in support of the Lodge resolution
specifically, nor the United States alone,
but asks that the governments that have
twice united In the treaties of 1890 and 1R93
In protecting the natives of Africa against
intoxicants to Hake further action sepa
rately and together so as to protect all
uncivilized races, as recommended by the
President. The petition is to be with
drawn and carried by a deputation to all
the prominent governments of the world
after Congress adjourns.
to the case of the Occidental and . Oriental
steamship Coptic, which arrived here Septem
ber SO, 1900. at about 7:S0 p. in., from Yoko
hama and Honolulu, when the passengers were
most indignant at the manner in which the
physical examination of their bodies was con
ducted. According to the evidence of many of
â¢he passenKers, among whom were merchants,
professional men and others of the highest
standing and reputation, the examinations were
made without proper regard to decency, pri
vacy, modesty or cleanliness, some of the pas
sengers declaring: that they would under no con
sideration come to or through this 'port, pre
ferring to land at Canadian ports, where more
courtesy and consideration were shown.
Whereas, We have been Informed that trans
portation companies In Canada have published
and distributed the complaints of the needless
hardships and trials suffered by passengers ar
riving here, in order to divert this travel from
the United States to their country Â»â¢ and.
Whereas. Occurrences of this nature are a
serious detriment to the business of this port
and. are a menace to our trade and commerce;
therefore the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco have Â¦ â¢
Resolved. That we hereby most respectfully
and earnestly urge upon the Honorable the Sec
retary of the Treasury that the officer In charge
of the quarantine station at this port be In
structed to perform the duties of his office with
Buch tact and Judgment as will enable travelers
to enter this port without being exposed to in
sult, needless delay, hardship and anxiety.
Dr. White has assured the Chamber of
Commerce that he has no animus in the
premises, and has also expressed his de
sire to meet the members In a spirit of
friendliness. Acting President Newhall
says the chamber is ready to supply Dr.
White with all the facts bearing on the
charges made by the organization.

WILL NOT RESIGN
Story That Wheeler Is to
Succeed Him Ridiculed
at Harvard.
BOSTON, Jan. 4.-In regard to a state
ment from San Francisco that President
Eliot of Harvard University was to re
eIrti and that President Benjamin -Ide
Wheeler of the University of California
was to succeed him, Charles Francis Ad
ams, treasurer of Harvard University
said to-night to" The Call representative
"There is absolutely nothing In it. The
rumor Is entirely without foundation."
The officials and instructors at Harvard
received a surprise to-day when they saw
the story from San Francisco. Nothing
has yet reached Harvard about the mat
ter, and everj' one seems to be completely
in the dark as to how It originated.
Corresponding Secretary Cobb said he
thought the story absurd, and the same
comment was made by Recorder Cram
and Publication Agent Williams. It was
th^ght that possibly President Eliot's
temporary absence from the university
might have something to do with it. An
attempt was made to see Dr. Walcott but
he was so engrossed in official business
at the State House that he could not be
interviewed. Several prominent Harvard
alumni of that city agreed to-day in say-
Ing that they did not believe there waa a
word of truth in the report that Dr. Eliot
would resign.'

EL. PASO, Tex.. Jan. 4.â When Presi
dent McKinley reaches El Paso in May,
on his way to California, he* will In all
probability be given the opportunity of
shaking hands with the chief executive
of the Mexican republic across the boun
dary line that divides the United States
from Mexico. A telegram received here
to-day from Congressman Slayden of
Texas gave the assurance that Mr. Mc-
Klnley would pass through El Paso on
his westward trip, and the citizens at
once interested themselves In preparing a
suitable reception for him. It was decided
among other things that It would be ap
propriate to in\-ite President Diaa of Mex
ico to visit the northern border of his
dominions at the time to meet and greet
the President of the United States In the
center of the international bridge that
spans the Hlo Grande, marking the boun

In case the Invitation is accepted, the

Mexican officials here are confident that
President Diaz will accept the invitation.

CHARGES CIVIL
SERVICE BOARD
WITH JOBBERY
Reduced.
Seyden Arers His Average
Was Fraudulently
Another instance of how the civil serv
ice system works under the present Phe
lan administration Is furnished by the
case of John F. Derham, who passed the
examination for, food inspector and yet
has been assigned to the position of clerk
to Health Officer O'Brien. It is but an
other example of how easy It is to Juggle
with positions and hoodwink the commis
sion, which is charged with Introducing
the merit system into the city govern
ment.
Derham, who happens to be a brother
in-law of Health Officer O'Brien, did not
take the civil service examination for
clerk, which was held September 15, 1900.
This failure, however, does not prevent
him from holding the position to the ex
clusion of two ellgibles, Daniel Sullivan
and \V. B. Ewing.
Derham was appointed cl<ark last June,
when J. W. Kelly resigned the place to
take a European trip. Kelly Is a cousin
of Mayor Phelan, and left the Impression
that he would not return to this city for
some time to come. It waa explained in
the health office that Kelly's absence was
only temporary and Derham would give
up the place on his return. Kelly, how
ever, would now be barred from the posi
tion, as he did not take the civil service
examination.
When the Health Board filed Its month
ly statement with the Civil Service Com
mission on Its salary roll Derham was
classed as "clerk to Health Oflicer" from
June until December. 1900. In the latter
month the designation of Derham's posi
tion was changed to "food Inspector." A
peculiar fact In this connection is that
Derham, as clerk, received $100 per month,
but now that he ranks as food inspector
he is entitled to only $75 per month, a de
crease of $25.
The Civil Service Commission holds that
the assigning of Derham to the position
of clerk when he is" classified as a "food
Inspector" is Illegal and an investigation
will result. The proceeding Is regarded
as an injustice to the ellglbles who passed
the examination for health office clerks.
It is also somewhat singular that the eli
glbles.for the position did not Me a com
plaint with the commission regarding the
irregularity. The reason why they did
not is that they feared to Incur the wrath
of the Health Board, which* might pre
clude them from future appointment.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
appointed James T. Donahue, W. J.
White, John C. Newlands and J. B. Gart
lands from the civil service clerks'
eligible V list. Two 3 more clerks will
be appointed to-day from the fol
lowing names certified: H. C. Far
quharson, Isaac L. Bevans, Israel
Schwartz and George M. Bowne.' Three
of the old staff of clerks lose their posi
tionsâF. B. Duffleld. "W. H. Griffin and
M. E. Cummings. The last named will be
retained as a deputy in the office.
Tax Collector Scott yesterday appointed
eleven deputies from the civil service eli
gible list as follows: Benjamin I. Salo
mon, Richard J. Curtln, Oscar L. Tuttle,
William I. Reardon, George A. McCalvy,
George Varcoe, Edwin B. Trlpp, Edwin
R. Zlon. Frank Rlttigstein, John A. Lena
han and Frank R. Smith.
The appointments are subject to the fil
ing and acceptance of a satisfactory
bond. Scott has submitted the first sev
enteen names on the eligible deputy list
to a surety company, for investigation as
to their reliability. Scott says he will
exact a bond of $6000 from all but four
deputies, whose responsibility, he says,
warrants a much higher bond.
Inspector to a Clerkship.
Health Board Assigns Eligible Food
Fraud, favoritism and gross prejudice
have been charged to Civil Service Com
missioners Freud, McCarthy and Quinn
In an action filed yesterday by John F.
Seyden on behalf of himself and the ma
jority of those deputies in the office of
the Tax Collector who lost their positions
through the enforcement of the civil ser
vice provisions of the charter.
Seyden, through his attorneys, Camp
bell, Metson & Campbell, seeks to enjoin
Tax Collector Scott from appointing to
official positions those clerks certified
by tho Civil Service Commission as being
eligible for appointment. He also asks
that the court direct the commission to
place him upon the register as eligible
for appointment and prays that thÂ« civil
service examination papers be examined
and that all competitors be given rank
according to "the true result" of the ex
amination. He further demands Judg
ment directing the commission to divide
the deputies to servo under the Tax Col
lector into two classesâ deputy tax and
deputy license clerksâ that each class
may be given a fair and practical examin
ation relating to the duties which will
fall upon them.
Seyden alleges that he has been de
frauded out of his right to appointment
under civil service rules. The Civil Ser

BOOZ'S MOTHER
ON THE STAND
Boy.
Tells Tearfully of the
Sufferings of Her
on the Throat and
Lungs. â¢
* Physicians Gitre Expert Testimony as
to the Effect of Tobasco Sauce
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 4.â The Booz
Congressional Committee, which was re
cently appointed by Speaker Henderson
Icr the purpose of making Inquiry Into
the cause of the death of Oscar Booz at
"West Point and to Investigate hazing in
general at the Military Academy, began
to take testimony tc-day. Three sessions
Trere held, covering a period of time from
* o'clock m the morning until midnight.
The committee went to Bristol, the home
cf the Booz family, this morning and
heard the testimony of four members of
that family. In the afternoon four phy
elciar.s who attended Oscar Booz were
heard and to-n!ght in Philadelphia two
more physicians and two other witnesses
testified.
The Congressional Committee will again
EO to Bristol to-morrow morning to hear
other witnesses and later !n the week
Trill sit In this city. Ex-Mayor Breth of
Altoona, Pa., whose pen, it is alleged, died
from an aliment indirectly due to hazing
fit Wept Point, and former cadet Burn
ham of Kentucky, a classmate of Booz
vlll appear before tne committee to-mor
row.
TV. H. Booz. father of the deceased
cadet, was the fijst witness. He was
sfked to tell the story of his boy's life !
vhlle at the Military Academy, as far as j
he knew. Mr. Booz then went over the
fame story he told before the War De- (
partment inquiry several weck6 ago.
He said Oscar did not complain of
"oagling," but spoke more of the fight
end the tobasco sauce incident. Oscar
told him he had Mack and blue mark?
on his body as a result of his encounter
with an upper class man. Oscar reluct
antly told his father tnat the hot sauce
had been poured Jown his throat three
times and that force was used.
"Mr. Booz." asked Congressman Wan
ger. "was your son absolutely truthful?"
"Ves. Fir; absolutely," was the reply.
"Oscar said he was getting along very
well until he received a heart blow which
knocked him out."
Oscar, the father eaid, never had any
throat or pulmonary troubles previous to
ccing to west Point. Oscar's eyes did
not trouble him before he went to the
ecademy.
"Do you believe that your son died as
a result of hazing at West Point?" Mr.
Booz *\r.s asked.
"I firmly do." he replied.
Mrs. Booz, mother of Oscar, said her
pon was in rugged health when he went
to The academy, but when he left he was
broken in health and never was in good
physical condition afterward. Mrs. Booz
Â¦wept as she detailed the sufferings of her
fon. She called the West Point cadets
bullies. She said Oscar eent a letter home
?Â¦ach week. In the fourth letter Oscar bo
pan to complain of 111 treatment. He rc
figmed, she said, because of his ill treat
ment, but in hi? resignation paper he gave
the weak condition of his eyes as thÂ»
reason for his quitting the academy.
Dr. William H. Martin of Bristol, who
examined Oscar Bocz's physical condition
preparatory to the young man going to
West Point, testified that he found him a
lair specimen of manhood. He noticed,
however, that his lung expansion was
t'.iphtly deficient.
"Do you think tuberculosis could have
teen caused by tobasco sauce being forced
down a person's throat T'
"I believe it can only be produced by
the Inhalation of germs."
""Would bums produced by the swallow
ing of the sauce leave a good ground
for the lodgment of tuberculosis germs?"
*Mt would." was the reply.
Dr. Joseph Abbott of Bristol testified
that Oscar Booz had, primarily, tubercu
lofjp, with a secondary extension into the
throat. He was cf the opinion that to
baseo raure could rot affect the lungs.
Dr. William P. Weaver, the family
physician, differed in opinion from ths
previous witnesses as to where the boy's
effectlon started. He was of the belief
that it started In the throat. He also
*>el!eve<i that the abuse, humiliation and
J>ar he was subjected to were sufficient
to lower the vitality of the boy.
Dr. J. Cohen, a throat specialist of this
city, was the first witness called at the
r.ipht spfsion held here. He testi
fied to Booz coming to him on August 4,
Wl. with a well developed case of tuber
culosis. He did not think the swallowing
nt tobasco sauce should produce tubercu
losis, hut it mljrM injure the throat.
S'{rrour!<l S. Albert, an ex-cadet, who
Â¦was a classmate of Booz. was tuen called.
Uooz. Albert said, was "cut" by many of
the cadets hecauw of Ms alleged eowartf
irr> !n his f jrht with Cadet Keller.
There wÂ«Â»re three fights Jn Albert's class,
.ft'bert 5a!d he was "vrryjnucb unsucces*
fnli Jn hi? contest n;id was Jibed ?ome
irhat because the uoprr class men said
Tie A16 not flprht lonsr f-nousrh. His
r.Â»nt. lie snld. was lieutenant -Peyton,
Â¦ vhrm *ie thoueht was iicw in the Phlllp
n'.re Islands. The other two lights' were
between Booz and Keller and Cadets Al
Â¦vnrr] and Meyer. Alvord. like Booz and
MmÂ«p'f. beirp also whipped.
Albert FUbsoquently stated that he waÂ«
1n two fights. His second contest was
â¢with a cadet named Doyle of his own
rlnsp. whem Albert called out for insult-
Ire him. He did not remember for what
nJTense he himself had been called out.
He taM each class had a fighting commit
tee, which wag appointed by th* class.
Albert said he was trore severely hazed
than other eadeta of nis class.
He was asked why and answered. "Prin
cipally because of my religion." Albert,
â¢who is a Hebrew, said he resigned from
trÂ«Â» academy partly because life there wa3
unbearable and partly because he disliked
military life. Albert further said if a
fr-urth class man incurred the displeasure
of sn upper class man the sentinels, who
were mostly cadets of the upper classei,
would enter false demerits against the
Â¦victim sjai In many cases the unfortunate
ca<3et would thus be forced out of tbÂ«
academy. Cadets, he bald, had the right
to appeal from the demerits. Albert flrm
lv heiirved that h* was ostracised at West
Point because of hlÂ« being 1 a Jew. He
testlSefl that he naxi been called a
"<3aTKr.ed Jew" by Cadets Meyer and
Jordan of the third class. Albert at first
. refused to Rive the names of these boys

SLAVE DEALERS'
NEW SUBTERFUGE
Prominent German Citizen to Guide the Destinies
of Popular Organization.
Deputy Immigration Commissioner H. H.
Schell made an important discovery yes
terday with reference to the attempt
made a few days ago to bribe him to al
low the landing of a comely Japanese
maiden named Naka Yamaguchi. When
she arrived here on January 1 on the City
of Peking she presented to the immigra
tion officials a passport purporting: to
have been issued at Yokohama and dated
July 17. This Is the date on which the
Peking left Yokohama on a former trip.
In explanation of the reason for the
passport having been dated so far back
Naka said that after -she received the
passport she was taken sick and was
obliged to defer her visit to this country
until a later, data. Captain Schell, being
suspicious of the explanation, made
search of the records of the office and
found on the manifest of the City of Pe
king for the trip leaving Yokohama on
July 17, 1900, the name of "Naka Yama
guchi, aged 21. student." The manifest
showed that the real Naka sailed from
Yokohama on July 17 and arrived here on
August 4, so that the conclusion was Ir
resistible that Naka sent her passport
back to Japan, where it was given to the
second Naka, who had assumed the name
for the purpose of having it flt the pass
port.
She has been ordered deported. Captain
Schell said yesterday that this was the
first Instance In his experience In which
a passjtort was used more than once.

American Generals Aotive

Distrlots.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4.â "This Is about the
fortieth time Aguinaldo has been killed,"
laughed Slxto Lopez, the Filipino envoy,
when he was shown the report to-day that
the Insurgent leader was dead, which had
come through President Wheeler of the
University of California and was based
upon the statements of Filipino students
in his charge.
"I think it would bÂ« very foolish to at
tach any importance to the prattle of
these students," continued Mr. Lopez. "I
know the Buencamlno family in Manila
and I am certain thev are not in a posi
tion to be Intrusted with great secrets by
the Filipinos. Before the Americans came
Buencamlno was very loyal to the Span
ish. Then he became a Filipino leader
for a short time and now he is an Ameri
can. Aguinaldo was alive when I received
my last advices.
"But the death of Agulnaldo would
really not make so very much difference
In carrying on the campaign. There aro
other reneraJs in the field who are just
as capable as Aguinaldo and if he were
killed the war would so right on just the
same."
Mr. Lopez thought the war likely to
continue indefinitely unless some terms
of settlement would be agreed upon. He
described the organization of the Filtp
plnos as very strong and their determina
tion to win independence as unchange
able.
Received by Wheeler.

BT7HTON REPORTS ON
RIVER AND HARBOR BILL/
Provides for Many* New Projects and
Appropriations.
Repeals Former Conditional
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.-Chalrman Bur
ton of the River and Harbor Committee
to-day filed the report; or the bill. The
number of projects provided for. la 408,
of whlch'232 are rivers and 146 harbors.
The need of careful scrutiny of items, the
report says. Is shown by the fact that
they were selected from Improvements on
which estimates had been made by United
States army engineers amounting to $300,
000.000. Section seven of the bill repeals
former conditional appropriations on the
following projects and requires the money
to be paid over to the treasury: Yellow
stone River, Montana and North Dakota,
and the boat railway In the Columbia
River.
Although the. total of the bill is large,
reaching $59,935,415, the report states that
appropriations were made only when jus
tified by the requirements of navigation
and to prevent injury to unfinished work.

The controversy between Attorneys Cof

record of the- proceedings in eonrt at the
time District Attorney Bylngton wanted
to repudiate any stipulation, as he had not
been consulted in the matter.
The record thowed that Collins admitted
the stipulation and insisted upon its being
carried out In its entirety, or that the test
cases then on appeal should be put back
on the Police Court calendars and hi.Â«
clients placed In statu quo. Coffey after
reading the record asked Collins if. In all
professional Integrity and honor, he could
deny that he was not cognizant of the
FtlpuJation.
Collins admitted that the record was
correct, but the only stipulation was that
all technicalities would be waived n^d
also a trial by Jury. There was nothing 1 .
he contended, to 6how that the defend
ents were to plead guilty to the remaining
cases in the Police Courts, and be there

Rlncon Hill has a mystery,, the. solving
of ."which may give work for. the; polled.
It Is a Bmall dark woman who travels': up
and down the streets with a small satchel
popularly supposed to contain hundreds
of counterfeit dollar pieces, which the
woman Is seeking to pass off upon.the un
suspecting tradesmen In the neighbor
hood. No one seems to know her. except
by sight, and no one. has so far taken any
of her bad money, but at least one is will
ing to swear she saw some of It, and was
nearly lured Into accepting one of.the
pieces. ,Â» Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦>
The mysterious character is best knowo
in the vicinity of First and Folsom
streets. She has been seen there .quite
recently, but not for- the last few days.
Mrs. Demartlni. who keeps the fruit stare
near the corner of First and Folsom
streets, was the last to see the dark
woman with, the satchel full of money.
She came into the store to make some
purchases and offered, a very bad .dollar
to pay for what she got. She was told
the dollar was bogus, . but she only
laughed, and opening her satchel showed
that she had plenty more of the same
kind. She did not offer to put up a better
dollar, but left the place. Since then she
has not been seen nor heard from. Â¦,-
It. is currently believed that she lives
somewhere on the hill, but just where no
one knows. Her name Is as much of a
mystery as . her people and occupation,
and but for the fact that she carries the
satchel believed to contain a store of
counterfeits . she would pass unnoticed.
There has been some talk of notifying the
police, but as no one seems to have been
victimized it Is not likely that such a
course will be taken. ; . .

Patrick Lude. a saloon-keeper at

arrested yesterday by Customs Surveyor
Spear on charges of smuggling.
The Surveyor learned that Lude a few
days ago had received nine bottles of
Imported Scotch whisky and 600 imported
cigars that had been smuggled. The
cigars had been given to Lucle . by the
master of the British ship Fanny Kerr
from Newcastle when she was lying at
Port Costa. The Scotch whisky was
given to Lucle by Captain Jefferson.
J-.ucie, after his arrest, made a state
ment to the United States Attorney to the
effect that Captain Jefferson was an inti
mate friend of his and that the whisky
had been presented In exchange for a
demijohn of eggnog and a wild goose.' He
put the-nlne bottles on the shelf back of
the bar for sale.
Both prisoners gave bonds ana were re

CAPTUilE OF rNTSTJUGENTS.
THINKS DAUGHTER
HAS BEEN STOLEN
INTERESTING addresses were *.
made last evening by Rabbi Voor
sanger and Rabbi Xieto before
their respective congregations,
Dr. Voordanger dwelling on the
remarkable achievements of the
past century and the possibilities
of the prf ?ent one, whl|e Dr. Xieto
took for his subject the question of
modern thoiiKht and the duty of par
ents In teaching religion to their chil
dren. ' . V Y
Dr. Voorsangrer In opening his ad
dress said that the world had learned
in the past few days of the claim of
Nikola Tesla that he had discovered
a means of communication with the
planet Mar?. Continuing, he said: "The
pkrptlcal may cast ridicule upon the
o!alm of the scientist, but science
teaches that nothing is impossible.
Many of the inventions and discover
ies of the past century vere ridiculed
when first brought to public notice.
The proverb that there is nothing new
under the sun is Incorrect. Things ab
solutely new are being discovered con
stantly. In 1866, when T.emple Emanu-
El was dedicated, The Call
in reporting the proceedings dwelt on
the use of gas in the synagogue. The
use of gas In a building to-day would'
net call for any comment. The In
ventions and discoveries of such men
as Arkwrlght, Stephenson, Lister, â¢
Morse, White, Edison, etc., were
"ridiculed when first brought
before the public, yet they
were accepted and were of
the greatest benefit to mankind. The
past century has done more than all.
of the previous centuries, and none
can tell the possibilities of the present
one. Whatever the neyr century brings
forth, the greatest element for the,
benefit of mankind will be the moral
element."
Rabbi Nieto spoke on the growth of
modern thought and Its bearing on re
ligion. He said: "It would not be well
for children to grow up and be allowed
to thJnk for themselves. Religion can
not be understood by a mere visit to
the house of worship once, a week or
on other occasions by Fpecial, Invita
tion of the Almighty. Religion must
not be taught on Friday nights and
Saturday mornings only, but all the
time. It must be taught In the syna
gogue an dalso In the home. Our par
ents took their children to the syna
gogue and also in the home.- Our par
ln great good. If the parent remain
at home when he should go to the syn
agogue, so will the children. The In
difference must be set aside and rich or
poor, Intelligent or ignorant, high or
low must so train their children In re
ligion that when the rising generation
arrives at manhood and womanhood
their conduct and actions shall be such
as' will not make the parent "ashamed
of their offspring."

and at menstrual periods I suffered terribly. At_times my back would ache
very hard. I could not lift anything or do any heavy work ; was not able to
stand on my feet long at a time. My husband spent hundreds of dollars for
doctors but they did me no good. My husband's sister wrote what the Vege-
table Compound had done for her, and wanted me to try it, but I did not then
think it would do me any pood. After a time, I concluded to try it. and I can
truly say it does all that is claimed for it. Ten bottles of the Vegetable Com-
and seven packages, of Sanative Wash have made a now woman of me, I have
had no wonjb trouble since taking the fifth bottle. I weigh more than I have
in years ; can do all my own housework, sleep well, have a prood appetite, and
now feel that life is worth living. I owe all to Lydia E. Â¦pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound. I feel that it has saved my life and would not be with-
out it for anything. I am always "glad to recommend it to all my sex, for I
know if they will follow Mrs. Pinkham's directions, they -will be cured."
Gratefully yours, Mrs. Asme Thompson, South Hot Springs, Ark.

NEW TORK, Jan. 4.â Bradstreet' s Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Anticipations . of
a bull market at the end of the year and
the beginning of the 'new century were . fully
verified by the strength and activity displayed
on last Saturday and Monday, many prom
inent stocks making new high record prices on
thoso days. When the market reopened on
Wednesday the upward movement continued
with public buying on a' large scale, support
and manipulation being displayed in various
parts of the list. Before the end Of the day
there was, however, a slackening of the mar
ket's progress and the realizing sales became
rather more prominent than the buying, and
prices consequently eased oft some and later
reactionary I tendencies asserted themsel\Ss.
This was due almost entirely to the advance
of the Bank of England rate from 4 to 5 per
cent, made necessary by the reduction of the
Institution's reserve to 27^4 per cent of its lia
bilities, tho lowest figures of the kind In a
generation. On last Saturday the London mar
ket suffered from the collapse of a large min
ing promotion company, the London and Globe,
which precipitated a dozen or so of failures In
the mining stock section of the London Stock
Exchange. This had an unsettling effect on
the whole London market and was niomentar
lly felt on this side. It did not' however, pre
vent London from responding to tJie continued
improvement on this side and on Monday
Americans were the only strong feature there,
while the foreigners were buyers in New York.
Meantime, . however, bad news about the sit
uation in South Africa depressed consols, and
the unfavorable position of the Bank of Eng
land in the London money market was be
coming more of a factor. Consequently, -when 1
the Bank of England rate was advanced, giv
ing evidence that the position at London was
considered sufficiently serious to warrant a
radical step, liquidation of stocks on a heavy
scale set in at the Britjsh capital. Heavy sell-
Ing of our stocks for'forelgn account at once
resulted, the pressure from . this | source being
sufficient to unsettle the entire market.. The
favorable New York bank statement ! of last
Saturday, the general belief that further ad
vances in prices were imminent and the freely
circulated reports of various deals and devel
opments have In the meantime resulted in
a considerable Jncreasa of speculative commit
ments. The, market, in fact, gave evidence, of
an accumulation of weak specnlatlve holdings,
and though fresh buying and support appear
ed at the concession on Thursday, i the profes
sional Â¦ element - In - Wall street ; quickly devel
oped a readiness to -work on the short Bide
Stocks were accordingly pressed for sale by the
bears and though Â¦ , the ' foreign selling â¢ had
slackened, the pressure from this source caused
considerable liquidation and dislodged many
insufficiently protected long holders of stocks
In Fomo cases, notably Jn American Sugar, the
break sassumed a sevete form, which had a
tendency to still further unsettle 'the market
NEW YORK, Jan.: 4.âCOTTONâ In the first
call prices declined 1Â©5 points In response to
disappointing Liverpool cables and in keeping
with foreign selling orders. : The low price
brought out speculative buying and local cov
ering and, in a short time quotations were ud
6@8 points, and for the rest of the session the
general tendency of variations, though slug
gish, was upward. A. flurry, of proflt-taklng

NEW YORK. Jan. 4.â To-day was one of the
most exciting days in the history of the New
York Stock Exchange. The matter of record
ing the transactions on the exchange is in
exact at the best and particularly In such a
market e.s to-day transactions are likely to
be lost from the record. But there cannot be
any doubt that the aggregate sales for to-day
excted anything ever done before on the ex
change. The recorded transactions fooled up
l.S3V,a'.O chares, compared with the previous
record cf l.â¬22,S'I& shares on November 12, 1SO0.
There have been wider price movements than
any of those made to-day in individual stocks,
or In groups of stocks, but it is doubtful
whether there has ever been so violent a fluc
tuation in the average price for all stocks
traded in as from the low price to the high
price to-day. The confusion during the early
hours of the market, while the ultimate course
of prices was still In controversy, was beyond
a.11 description and the excitement during the
late hours of the day, when the demand was
at its height and prices were moving most rap-
Idly upward, warrants the use of the term
frenzy. Blocks of znany thousands of shares
of stocks were banaied about from hand to
hand among the brokers with no more appar
ent consideration beyond the. excitement of the
came than boys fhow In playing marbles. Con
sidering the extreme variations In prices and
the highly concentrated character of some of
the dealings, it is not exaggerating to say
that vast fortunes were made or lost on the
floor of the exchange during the day. The oc
casions are very rare when sentiment on thJb
exchange has been so abruptly changed from a
mood of depression to one of excessive exhilara
tion as shown to-day, though events have oc
curred to precipitate sudden panics In the
rcidÂ£t of tpeculative excess. It would be use
less te attempt to analyze closely the causes
underlying euch a market. There was a re
crudescence In full force of the bullish senti
ment Â¦which has stirred up the stock market
for two months part, and the effect was the
more acute by reason of the rebound from
yesterday's depression. The day opened with
the bears In a confident mood and they at
tacked the market wltb enthusiasm. The de
cidedly gloomy state of mind in London stock
circles was of great aid to them and they
were able to force declines running from 1 to
1 points at the very outset. Yesterday's sharp
reaction broupht in profit-taking and stop-loan
orders from many outside sources, but the evi
dences of support were sufficient even in the
opening dr-allngs to serve as a warning to the
bears, and they began to cover very early.
The rebound In Sugar on the etory of a settle
ment of the trade war was In its effect a back
pet for the bears. The powerful level which
moved the whole market was St. Paul. The
Mory current for some time that the road
Is to be leased to the Northern Paclflc and
Great Northern on the guarantee of a dividend,
Â¦with xrrellminary distribution of the company's
priiat surplus, received renewed credence, al
though there was no additional confirmation.
The variations wrought in this tale in thÂ»
current rumors were almost infinite and will
probably never be straightened out _ until an
official authorized statement Is given out. It.
Is sufficient to state now that the price moved
upward as a r<*ult U% points from the low
level of sales of over 24?.000 rhares. Notwith
standing feverish vlbrationo the price closed
within M cf the top. Parallel with thin rise
was an upward movement in Northern Pacific
of s points and In Great Northern preferred
of 7 points. Without attempting to specify
other Individual movements, it is sufficient to
*ey that the rains In ail the stocks most ac
ttrely traded in ranged from 2 to over 6
points, and in New Jersey Central the rise
reached nearly S points. The market closed
btsH Intense excitement and furious activity.
Â¦with many stocks at the top price* and rising
buoyantly.
Recoveries In the bond market were not so
peneral as in stocks and the weakness of many
railroad hnrifls perrlrted. Total sales, par

NEW YORK. Jan. 4.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
In spite of the interruptions. of the holidays
and of the usually heavy annual settlements
In all lines of. business, the new year opens
with indications of further progress. There
Is no lack of 'contracts offered at steady prices
in the country's leading industry and in some
departments of cotton . goods there Is a bet
ter movement, though . speculation has de
pressed the price of the raw material. Other
wise a decline in wheat Is the only noteworthy
move instanced. It Is. explained by a reduc
tion in the flour output at Minneapolis, somo
mills shutting down, while the foreign demand
at Atlantic seaboard cities Is not brisk. The
ordinary measures of business make gratify
ing exhibits. No alteration has yet been made
in quotations of steel products and this In
dustry Is on such a firm foundation that most
large concerns have maintained wages at the
old scale, instead of making the reductions
anticipated. Iron ore prices are also unchanged
and no action Is now expected until March,
although - a Â¦ lower rate was looked for â¢ early
ta January.
Coke is firmly held at ConnellsvlHe and there
are fewer idle ove-ns, while the much discussed
fall In prices seems confined to inferior quali
ties at outside furnaces. Pig iron sells freely
for delivery up to April and there is no indica
tion of weakness. All finished products are
eagerly sought, many large contracts having
been placed for structural material and others
are under consideration. An American com
pany Is the lowest bidder for the large bridge
at Sydney harbor, Australia. The purchase
of seven hundred acres near Plttsburg by a
leading steel company Indicates great enlarge
ment of Its plant. Aside from one reduction
of wages at blast furnaces in the Mahontng
and Shenango valleys, the week's news is most
encouraging in this, the greatest of American
industries.
The market for textiles has been featureless,
as the holidays and stock-taking reduced busi
ness to limited dimensions. Wool has again
declined, making the average of 100 quotations
19.2C cents, according to Coates Bros.' circu
lar. Sales at three chief Eastern markets
amounted to only 3.121.000 pounds for the week.
and there Is much uneasiness over the state
ments .of largest stocks at the end of the
year, . while recent failures have not tended
to Improve the tone. Cotton goods have not
the same difficulties to contend with, but an
abnormally high price for raw material acts
as & check on this industry. Local jobbing
and retail trade is brisk In : boots and shoes
and many manufacturers are behind with or
ders. Yet uneven distribution of business has
left some shops ready to make concessions.
Shipments from Boston for the week were
82,443 cases, against 91,665 a year ago. Sole
leather Is purchased freely, but less activity
in upper tends to weaken prices. Exports of
sole from this 'city were heavier In December
than in any previous month last year, but
the total for 1900 fell 3C6.936 sides below 1?99.
For the first time In many weeks there was
some recovery In hides In Chicago.

has proved>'a slight' stimulenf- to the retail
trade . In winter goods, but stocks In retailers'
hands are reported large. Cereals and provislona
have advanced this week,. while stocks have de
clined, but the upward movement has been one
of those familiar of late, a short selling with
small fluctuations, limited by a feverish desire
to bag profits. Railroad earnings hold up well
for the Beason and the great dividend pay
ments on record were reflected in the largest
day's bank clearings ever reported at New
York. Failures show the usual largo crop of
email disasters, â¢ a feature Â¦ of the turn of the
year, but the - results for ; 1900 as a whole are
not all discouraging. December bank clearings
hold the record, although, the total of 1900 as a
whole is 8.6 per cent behind 1899.
Ootton is rather quiet and unchanged on the
week, while . cotton goods are without much
movement, . except as to slightly weaker quota
tions for gray cloths at Boston. Fall River
mills have paid 7& per cent for 1900 and an
average of 6.50 per cent for eleven years past.
Spring, trade In prints and- glnffhams has be
gun In fair volume at Boston. Wool is dull and
rather : easy. Outside of , the United States,
however, the. situation U a strong one, aa In
dicated by the firm Melbourne and London
quotations. Manufacturers will- only i buy
against orders, and except In plain dress wool
ens nothing special is doing.
All branches of the leather and kindred trades
are in apparently cheerful mood.
Lumber Is rather quiet, but it is to be noted
that pine stocks are slightly smaller than last
year. . War is reported broken out in rub
ber firoods and quotations have certainly been
cut. Sugar. prices are also lower, while coffee
(roasted) has been advanced, which is charged
to "readjustments."
The feature of the week in iron and steel has
been the large sale of steel rails reported, and
from Chicago particularly, reporting 25,000 tons
sold in one lot. This spirit of activity contrasts
strongly with the quiet reported In nearly all
finished lines and also in raw pig. â¢
Structural material makers have been getting
good orders and brldgemakers are looking for a
heavy business. This month may witness the
eettlement of the vexed ore situation and also
some readjustments of wages to lower costs.
Bessemer iron producers have reduced wages 15
per cent. Export trade Is still quiet, and It ia
notable that for the first time In years exports
of . manufactured goods In November were
smaller than the year before.
' What locked for a while like a real bull
movement In wheat developed at the close of
last week. Realizing by^Jthe bulls lost most of
the advance, but there Is a feeling in the trade
that a strong operator could materially affect
prices In the present condition of the market.
Corn arrivals are still of notably poor grade
and quotations are higher In sympathy with
Â¦wheat and on large export movement.
. Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
Â¦week aggregate 3.914.301 bushels, against 3.66S,
155 last week, 2.609.C82 In the corresponding
week of 1900. 6.860,268 in 1899, 3,481,576 in 1S98 and
3.108.6S8 In 1S97.
From July 1 to date this season wheat exports
were 0S.0C5.E78, against 106,503,875 last season.
and 128.388,971 In 1898-99.
- Business failures for the week number 268 In
the United States, against 213 last week, 229 in
1900. 237 in 1899. 333 In 1898 and 488 in 1897.
The Â¦ opening ' was -. higher â¢ on an advance In
prices at the yards and on heavy shipments.

FIERCE STRUGGLE
WITH A MADMAN
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Jan. 4.
After destroying $5000 worth of property
and nearly killing himself and the officer
who frustrated his attempt at suicide.
I..ouis Peterson of Pleasanton is safely
confined In the insane ward of thÂ© Re
ceiving Hospital.
Last night some of Peterson's neigh
bors discovered that his house and barn
were on fire, and gathered to help him
save his property. Peterson lived alone
on the Schweer ranch, near town, and the
flames had gained good headway before
the neighbors reached the spot. They
found Peterson gloating over the destruc
tion of the buildings, and when they
asked him what he was doing he burnt
into maniacal laughter and attempted to
rush into the blazing house. He was
overpowered and taken to . town and
lodged in a room at the Pleasanton Hotel
for safe keeping. Shortly afterward the
proprietor of the house saw smoke issuing:
from the room where the insane, man was
confined, and called Marshal. Ed Head to
â¢help. him. Together "they entered the
room. The lunatic was lying 6n the mat
trees, which he had' taken from the bed
and set, on fire. As soon as he heard the
men opening the door he leaped up. and
as Head entered struck the marshal a
knockout blow on the forehead. As the
officer went down the furious prisoner
caught up a chair and brought it down
upon his head. laying the scalp open and
nearly fracturing the skull. Before he
could strike again a half-dozen men were
upon him. A frightful struggle ensued In
the blinding smoke, but finally the mad
man was secured and bound and. the fire
extinguished. He was then locked up In
the- town Jail awaiting his removal -to
Oakland, â¢
Head will recover. Besides the bruises
en his head ho has an ugly wound on the
right hand, where the maniac .fastened
hin teeth during the encounter.

of California on a subject which had been
with him a life study. He continued his
address, Faying:
I have spoken of this as an auspicious occa
sion. Perhaps very few here understand the
significance of this meeting. This work goes
by the deep purpose Implanted In the hearts
of a few people.
I do not know of anything more Important
for the State of California than the formation
of a Ptate Board of Charities and Corrections.
Now, what Is a State Conference of Charities?
It Is an educational Institution. The simpler
your machinery the better. The simplicity
of such an organization Is essential to Its
suocess.
A platform has very little practical utility.
Much valuable time is wasted arguing on
platforms. Come together and talk these
things over freely; discuss them with one an
other. If you are to succeed in your particu
lar line of work you must broaden your vision.
I said this should be an educational institu
tion, and it Is astonishing how much you can
learn. I don't know what would become of us
In this world If there were not some poor
helpless brings to take care of.
You will make a mistake If you get legisla
tion too soon. It Is a mistake to get legisla
tion before your public are educated up to the
necessary pitch. Tour work Is to educate the
pr.ople and then you will get legislation. We
are building for generations that are to come.
You can't grow a social Institution In five
years. This work Is one in which we can af
ford to go slow enough to give It a normal
growth.
It Is not discouraging when you find plans

I am here as a learner, not as a teacher.
Here we are to do this work as best we can.
This work has rot to be done: those who are
down have to be lifted un. And now we want
to know what Is the best method to accomplish
this great work. This is our first experiment In
this State, and under It we hope to do great
Rood. We get together and warm our hearts by
the mutual enthusiasm we create.
There Is one thing tn particular that I want
to â - done by this conference. I want to seÂ«
it do all It can townâ * a Ptate board of chari
ties. It Is no new "experiment.- It has been
tried In many States. Its functions are ad
visory *nd its power that of investigation. It
has the power to iro into any State charity and
report to the Legislature the result of Its ln
veÂ»tliratlon. The remarkable thine about them
is that no State that has once had one has
ever been able to do without it. I- think that
will be the ease If we establish one here.

and paid a well-worded tribute to the
speaker of the evening, Dr. Hastings S.

Conference of Charities and Corrections.
an able speaker and competent authority
on philanthropic work. Mr. Davis spoke
in part as follows:
LEADIN'G SPIRITS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONFERENCE OF
CHARITIES AND CORRECTION. WHICH INAUGURATED A FOUR
DAYS' SESSION AT THE OAKLAND CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.
"The city to which I welcome you Is not
so unfortunate as to need any ministra
tion of the kind which you are assembled
here to-r.Sght to discuss. We have here
no need for the soup kitchen, no potato
patch, from the parasite we are free. The
work of the Associated Charities has been
so well done that the. parasite has sought
other pastures. This city acknowledges
its debt to the originator of the Idea. WÂ«
make no boast, we welcome you unselfish
ly to this our conference. Tou will besret
in this our city a new enthusiasm for do

The election of the following officers of
the conference was then ratified: Horace

MAN FROM MEXICO
HIS OWN ATTORNEY
Welcomed to the City.
PHILANTHROPISTS of both sexes
and many creeds, but each and all
actuated by one primal motive,
that of extending a helping hand
to the inmates of institutions of
restraint or reform, met last night in the
chapel of the Congregational church of
Oakland and Inaugurated the four days'
session of the State Conference of Char
ities and Corrections, the first gathering
of such a nature to be held in the extreme
Western States. In the fact that tho
conference is being held the speakers who
addressed the meeting found much of
pratulation and promise.
The motive underlying the address of
every speaker lay in the necessity each
felt of securing legislation to establish
a State Board of Charities with advisory
and perhaps reformatory powers, and the
applause with which their views were
met showed that tho sentiments of each
speaker found an echo In the hearts of
the hearers. An ,ict has been drawn
up in the rough and will be presented to
the conference for its Indorsement.
At the hour set for the meeting to as
semble a representative gathering of the
State's charity workers was called to or
der in the assembly hall of the chapel by
Chairman B. H. Peodleton, who. after
prayer had been offered by Dr. Brown,
the pastor, introduced Mayor Snow of
Oakland, who delivered a cordial address
nf welcome tn the delegates, speaking In
part as follows:

Mantel Makes Some Counter
Charges, but Pails of
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Jan. 4.
Adam Mantel, the matrimonially mixed
man from Mexico, has made a start to
defend the accusation of desertion which
his pretty young wife, formerly Ml-;s
Eva Cuthbert, has laid against him. Man
tel appeared in the Superior Court to-d^y
with an answer and counter charges. He
made ready to act as his own attorney
In the divorce proceedings, but his lack
of sufficient money to meet the necessary
court charges blocked the hearing. Man
tel was compelled to ask for further time
In which to arrange the financial mat
ters.
Mantel has a special grievance against
Miss Carrie Maxwell of Fruitvale, whom
he specifies as having caused his wife
to leave him in Mexico. On the other
hand, Mrs. Mantel has narrated a story
of remarkable misconduct and ill treat
ment. She fortifies her complaint with a
stack of letters from the man she wedded
and from whom she was parted an. hour
after the ceremony.
But for the willingness of Attorney A.
V Mendenhall, Mr?. Mantel's counsel, to
havÂ« the Issue forced upon the husband,
Mantel would have lost all chance of
meeting the charge, in court, because
the legal time for appearance has elapsed.
"In view of the publicity Mantel has
eiven to his accusations, Mrs. Mantel is
depirouB of making the contest in the
courts." explained Attorney Mendenhall.
"We have heretofore not taken advan
tage of the technical right to a default.
Mrs Mantel was abused and 111 treated
so grossly that she desires to vindicate
herself." " ? 'l^
A board of control In this State would, I

that have been discarded by the people of the
more progressive States still in force In the
West. I hope you will send a good, strong del
epatlon to the National Conference at Wash
ington Â¦ and that they will keep their eyes
upon what In best In public institutions.
State . boards of charities differ in different
States. In Minnesota the State Board of
Charities had no executive function beyond
that of inspection. In Illinois the State board
has no function but an advisory one.' There
has been much debate as to which method Is
best. State boards of control are always sal
aried.
What Is a State Board of Charities for? It
Is for the inspection of the charities of the
State. They study the condition of the In
stitutions In order that they may give advice.
The State Board of Charities becomes a bal
ence wheel to regulate the management of the
institution. It is hard to continue abuses
when there is publicity. A State Board cf
Charities must be free from the baleful ele
ment of partisan politics.
Now I wouldn't: recommend that you oome
out and eommrnca war upon politicians. But
I would recommend that you lend all your ef
forts toward bringing about such reform aa
hhs taken nlace in Indiana.
If there Is one man in this audience who hna
made up his mind that there shall be a Stata
Conference of Charities he'll get it. If the
Governor can understand what this thing is
he will eurely further your efforts. There is
one thing people don't seem to understand and
that is how much can be done without legis
lation.
The average ltfe of an Insane person after
entering an institution used to be twelve years.
It is longer now, since the advent of the Board
of Charities.
To run a State Board of Charities It is ab
solutely necessary to keep away from partisan
politics. To do this the best method Is to
give no salaries with the positions. Now the
question arises shall you hare an advisory
board or a State board of control? If I were
established In this State -I should advocate the
forrr.a.tlon of an advisory board. I believe you
will find an advisory board your best plan.
I bolieve that now you are In the Inception of
a great movement. Now Is the time for you
to j>ut yourself abreast of the great thought
of the time. If you compare your peniten
tiaries with those of the other great State* I
think you will find that there is room for lm
provementr

tees composed of people with a Bnnp&thetlc In
terest In the work which they are to do. Each
Institution phould be left In care of a board
local to Itself. Such a board should contain
men who have the humanitarian Interests of
the Institution at heart.
California's criminals and insane persons are
maintained at a much lower per capita and per
diem rate than is Incurred In any other State.
I favor the establishment of a State board of
charities. It would prevent the evil effects of
the political clean sweeps which have, in numer
ous Instances played havoc with the workings
of many of our best managed State institu
tions.

The Varney case In Its present status
affords Attorney Wheeler the- sweets of
revenge for the excoriation he endured
from counsel for the trustees .In the
former trial. In to-day's hearing 'he un
mercifully grilled the guardians of the
Varney estate.
During the examination of Henry P.
Varney. brother of Thomas H. B. Varney'
the matter of the transfer of tha Kennedy
mining stock, so disastrous to the estatÂ©
and finally to the trustees, was taken ud
Item by item. "
"What about these bigr Hems for attor
neys' fees?" asked Wheeler. "Here Is a
payment for $600, for instance. What was
that for?"
Varney identified a voucher describing
the account. It appearing that the fee waa
paid for settling the second annual ac
count of the mining stock transfer
"Well, your Honor, we object to that
Hem. Your Honor has decided that that
was a fraudulent account, and it would
seem hardly the thing to charge the fee
to the estate."
The objection was sustained.
Again. Attorney Goodfellow was made
a partner. with the trustees in a payment
of compliments from his old opponent
"Here Is another Item of $500 for attor
ney's fees. What 19 that for?" asked
Wheeler.
The voucher showed that Goodfellow
had received the sum In question In pay
ment for his legal services In defending
the Ayers suit against the trustees.
Â¦ "That would better come out." remarked
the attorney for the hdrs. drily. "Mr
Goodfellow received $300 for the defense of
the misdced3 of. the trustees, and the
trustees turn around and charge It to the
very heirs who suffered by those mis
deeds. We object to the Item."
The $500 was not allowed.

STILL LOVES MAN
ONCE HER HUSBAND
of Berkeley and now staying in San Fran-
Cisco, came to Oakland to-day and de
posited 120 ball for his appearance In Jus
tice Qulnn's court next week to answer
to several charges of battery ami disturb
ing the peace preferred by his late wife.
The Hulls squabbled for years before
they were legally separated In Arizona
a short time ago and they are still at It.
The moment their marriage- was annulled
both headed for Berkeley as fast as they
could to take possession of the property
at 2127 Ashby avenue. Both arrived at
the same time and took possession. They
lived In the same house without having
anything to do with each other until
Mrs. Hull yesterday got a deputy con-
Stable and had her former husband
ejected. She then secured warrants for
his arrest upon several misdemeanor
charges. Hull left his wife In possession
of the Berkeley property and went to San
Francisco, where he is staying at the
Palace Hotel.
Hull is said to be worth half a million
dollars and to be interested In the copper
mines of Montana with W. A. Clark.
When Hull came to Oakland to-day and
deposited his ball he refused to make any
statement, but his ex-wife was more com
municative. Mrs. Hull told the following
story of their difficulties and why she had
her husband arrested upon misdemeanor
charges:
"Mr. Hull and I were married tn
Phoenix. Ariz., three years ago. We went
East and lived in Boston for some time.
Then we went to New York, where my
husband deserted me. He left me and
my child in a boarding-house and was
gone for seven months before I heard
from him. As I was without money. I
returned to Boston, where I had friends.
At the last extremity I applied to some
stock brokers in Boston who were doing
business for Mr. Hull and got money
from them. I was 111 at the time, and
when I recovered I went to them for
more money so that I could go to my
home. They told m* Mr. Hun had tele
graphed them that he would arrive the
next day. I waited for him and when he
came he told me I was a vile, drunken
woman and that he would have nothing
more to do with me. He also declared
that he had a divorce, but I knew this
was false, because I had not been served
with papers. We were inf his lawyers'
office when he told me that he would,
have nothing more to do with me. I
dropped my head on his shoulder and
wept I couldn't help it. He said he.
didn't want any scene there and pushed
me out into the hail.
"Later he went to Providence, R. I.,
and in November of last year commenced
divorce proceedings there. He hired two
men to testify that they had seen me
drunk. It was necessary for him to swear
that he had been a resident of Providence
for a year before he could commence di
vorce proceedings. It was proven that
he hadn't and the Judge wanted me to
swear to a warrant for his arrest for per
jury- I refused until my husband was
safely out of the way. I refused because
I loved my husband and I love him still.
I love him just the same as when we were
married.
"Mr. Hull returned to Arizona and I
followed, first swearing to the perjury
warrant. We met and I told him not to
go East because he would be arrested. He
went, however, and was arrested in Prov
idence, then In Boston and again in Al
bany. I Baved him by not appearing
against him.
"When he returned from the East we
came to California and he purchased thi.^
house in Berkeley, having the deed made
out in both- our names. He also deposited
$5000 tn the Oakland Savings bank on our
Joint account, arranging for me to draw
$100 a month.
"Three months ago h* went to Arizona
and commenced proceedings to have our
marriage annulled. Twenty-five years
ago, when I was a very green girl, but
17 years old. I married a man named Low
ell. Ha deserted me after three year?.
and later I got a letter from a friend.
Jules Howard, who said that Lowell had
died In Albuquerque. Mr. Hull hired a
man to pose as Lowell. This man claimed
that he was my legal husband, but he was
nothing but an old bum. Mr. Lowell was
five feet eight inches high and had gray
eyes; this man was stx feet tall and had
blue eyes. On his testimony and the free
use of Mr. Hull's money our marriage
was annulled.
"I started Immediately for Berkeley and
arrived here New Year's day. the same
day Mr. Hull did. I found thÂ» house oc
cupied by Mrs. M. J. Hewett. whom. Mr.
Hull had brought from Boston. We all
occupied the house and Mr. Hull lived
with her for three days under the same
roof with his wife and child. If I had
been a desperate woman I'd have killed
her.
"Wednesday, when I was in Oakland
on business, they packed their things and
left. I think they were frightened out.
"Back of all this trouble Js Mr. Hull's
mother and his family. They are trying
to get rid of me bodily so that they can
keep his property from mÂ«. There are no
grounds upon which he could get a di
vorce. I have been a faithful wife and
mother. Mr. Hull has told many vile
things about me. He said that I beat my
child, but only once In Boston I slapped
its legs and then ray husband struck me
and I fell unconscious.
"I have been married three times. After
Mr. Lowell died I was married to a San
Francisco 'man. He was worthless, and
Mr. Hull, who wanted me then, paid for
my divorce. I cannot give my second
husband's name because many of my old
Ban Francisco friends would know who
I was. Under the name of Hull they don't
know me, and I don't want them to know
of all this trouble."
Mrs. Hull is not positive what her fu
ture steps will be. She will, however, ap
' peal .the annulment case to the higher
Arizona courts In an endeavor to prove
that she Is Hull's legal wife. She will
also try to get a division of property.
She says that she does not know Huira
exact wealth, but that he owns the town
site of Jerome. Ariz., and many valuable
! copper mines.
: Since yesterday the Hull residence at
I 2127 Ashby avenue has been watched by
Jack Haggerty. who says that he Is em
ployed by Hull to see that nothing Is
taken away from the house.
This morning A. R. Peterson was ap
pointed by Judge Ellsworth to watch
after the Interests "of Henry Bias, who
holds a chattel mortsrage on the Hull
property.

Rolling Stock in New Zealand.
This Government has recently placed
Â¦with one of our well-known firms an order
for sixty odd passenger coaches at a cost
of about $500,000, to be built under the su
pervision of a railway official who is now
en routÂ© to the United States. The plac
ing of this order has caused much ad
Â¦verse criticism among the labor parties,
but the Government does not appear to be
greatly perturbed. The order calls for
specially designed and constructed
coaches to suit the narrow gauge railways
throughout the colony, and they will be
of the latest and most modern pattern, In
cluding every up to date Improvement
known to American carbullders. It is ex
pected that these coaches will be shipped
from New York City in March, 1901.
Mr. "Ward, the Minister for Railways,
while in the United States last year, thor
oughly studied our railways, coaches, lo
comotives and general : management, and
has. In consequence thereof, inaugurated
many reforms in his department.â Frank
Dllllngham, Consul at Auckland.

with power to deliver the goods, cannot
redeem the promises already out, to say

Perhaps every Republican Assembly
man wants the chairmanship of a good
committee. It Is natural to Infer that a
member should prefer an important to a
subordinate place. It is obvious that sev
eral Assemblymen are anxious to get on
the winning side In order to secure the
committee recognition desired, but there
are many able and intelligent Assembly
men who regard it their highest duty to
get on the right side. Recognition is
bound to come to public men who adhere
to principles of right and decency.
When the Assemblymen elected to serve
the State get together in Republican cau
cus at Sacramento they will consider the
moritB of the candidates for Speaker and
indorse the man that seems to possess
the ability, experience and integrity re
quired to discharge the responsible duties
of the position.
New members of the Legislature may

Reaction in Favor of Anderson Sets In, While Efforts to

Kelly announces that he is familiar with
Pendleton's record and commends it.
The charge is laid against Alden An
derson that he voted against Colonel
Burns for United States Senator. It la
the truth that he voted for General W.
H. L. Barnes at the regular session and
for Thomas R. Bard at the extra session.
The Examiner and the Phelan evening
paper openly assert that the politicians
who were in sympathy with Colonel
Burns during the Senatorial contest have
combined to defeat Anderson.
The scene of activity in the contest for
the speakership will ee transferred to

I the indorsement of Pendleton's
II candidacy for Speaker by Boss
XL Martin Kelly's bunch of San Fran
cisco Assemblymen has percepti
bly subsided. A reaction in Anderson's
favor was noted yesterday by calm ob-'
servers of the contest. Boss Kelly plan
ned secretly for the conference Indorse
ment, hoping to create a sudden storm of
enthusiasm that would swing the arriv
ing Assemblymen from the country Into
line for Pendleton.
When reports of the slump were taken
to Boss Kelly last evening, he decided
that a livinp example of leadership should
be exhibited at once, hence he sallied
down to the Grand Hotel and joined a
few of his faithful followers at the bar.
His presence, however, did not inspire the
enthusiasm that his previous exhibition
aroused.
Ref.ublican members of the Legislature
are beginning to perceive that it -would
be bad for the Republican party and bad
for the State of California to accept a
programme of organization from Martin
JCeUjr. When Assemblymen Schillig and
Gans arrived last night they were impor
tuned to Join the Pendleton forces, but
they wisely refrained from committing
themselves.

worked together in such societies as the Red

the Women's National "War Relief Association

Young Men's Christian Association. It has
bÂ«en a. great pleasure to us. I assure you, to

Eminent Surgeon Speaks on
the Beauty of the City's ?
Pleasure Place.
DR. LANE TALKS
OF PARK WONDERS
Dr. L. C. Lane, the eminent surgeon,
opened' the "nineteenth annual course of
Lane lectures at Cooper Medical College
last evening with an exhaustive address
on Golden Gate Park. The flora and
fauna of the park were treated from the
standpoint of the scientist, but the tribute
he paid to those whose efforts have done
most for the Improvement of the park
proved that, aside from matters of scien
tific Interest, the park was to him, as to
all, a source of Individual pride â the pride
of a citizen in meritorious public achieve
ments, .i ..
That, so much had. been done In a few
years was a source of wonderment to him,
he said, and even more so was the great
advance of recent months in the construc
tion of new driveways and lakes and
structures that will, ever stand as evi
dence of. the love of some citizen for his
home city and Its great pleasure place.
James Lick, he said, saw before he passed
from this life that ample provision was
made for the raising of the magnificent
monument Inclosing the statue 'of Fran
cis.. Scott Key, writer, of, "The Star
Spangled Banner"; Senator Sharon, In
the last hours of life, provided for a play
ground for the city's children: under the
direction of former Mayor Alvord the
great work of the park was commenced;
Charles Crocker aided in the re-estab
lishment of the conservatory; Mr. de
Young has established the great museum,
and to the love of Claus Spreckels for his
city and the park the erection of Its
crowning "architectural wonder" Is due.
"Claus Spreckels. whom I will ! name
am^ng the proven friends of the park and
the city," said Dr. Lane, "has contributed
more than any other man to the industry
and advancement of the Pacific Coast.
It was he who went across the ocean and
established the vast sugar industry that
has given employment to thousands of our
citizens, and hia vast refineries are *the
result of his enterprise. It was he who
has made the' sugar beet Industry one of.
the greatest of the coast, and in the same
line has advanced other industries and
commerce. The last act of this remark
able man has .broken the shackles of
monopoly that held fast the people of San
Francisco, who will now enjoy the com
fort and warmth of light at reasonable
rates. To every great and modest under
taking his purse was open. An archi
tectural wonder In the parkâ the great
music standâ Is but one evidence of his
love for San Francisco and her Institu
tions, and it will ever stand an Imperish
able monument of his love for Golden
Gate Park."
From his tribute to the worth of those
men whose energies have made the park
what It Is to-day. Dr. Lane rapidly con
cluded his discourse on trie plant life In
the park. He followed his expression of
gratitude for the preservation of the
great forests of this State to his expres
sion of contempt for those men who de
stroy animal life In the pursuit of their
enjoyment of plant life. He referred to
those men who enjoy the fragrance and
beauty of the flowers and fields of the
park and In doing so drive Jaded horses
to death or add to their sufferings with
the lash.
"It Is a fact to be regretted, but every
day one is forced to see horses In the
park suffering In silence as they bear the
whip," said the lecturer. "Mohammed,
when he established his religion, did not
forget the horse. 'Be good to your
horses, 1 he said, and I add to Mohammed's
mandate: Don't cut off their tails."
Dr. Lane pointed out the fact that
Golden Gate Park contains 1070 acres,
"which are more than are contained In
all the parks of a number of the biggest
cities. Water has been developed," he
said, "lakes and cascades add their
beauty to the general scene and out of a
wilderness of sand a paradise of green
has grown for the comfort, for the pleas
ure, for the enjoyment of all."
In London, he concluded, men have
been dragged from lives of drunkenness
by having their interest In plants and
nature's beauties revealed to them
through the efforts of a society for that
purpose. There, he said, the curing of
the drunkard had been effected through
centering his mind on the better .things
of life. There his plants were raised In
little pots or boxes, for soil was scarce.
If such good as thus reported had come
from those plants and flowers all citizens
of San Francisco should glory in the
magnificence of nature's favors to them,
which, aided by the art of man, had
given them one of the world's most beau
tiful pleasure places..;-^ .:
WATER INQUIRY
NEARING THE END
gineer Schussler.
Supervisors Are on a Still
but Vain Hunt for En-
Important Testimony Given in Refer
ence to tlie Valuable Calaveras
Property of the Spring
Valley Company.
The Board of Supervisors Is nearlng the
end of its Inquiry into the affairs of the
Spring Valley Water Company prepara
tory to fixing rates for water for the next
fiscal year. The Investigation was re
eumed last night and developed two points
of Interest. Hermann Schussler. chief" en
gineer of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, and the witness whose testimony
Is of vital moment, was not present, and
there is nothing to indicate when he will
be, as he is reported ill. The other point
was the admission under oath that the
Spring Valley Water Company made Its
investment in the enormously valuable
Alameda and Calaveras property not for
Â¦existing n^eds of San Francisco but for
future uses.
Pelham W. Ames took the witness" stand
as soon as the beard convened. As secre
tary of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, he supplied the board with a se
ries of facts and figures which ' for tne
purposes of the inquiry was neither ex
ceptionally interesting nor important. Mr.
Ames gave the cost of tiie Belmont, Ala
mt-da and other properties of the com
pany. These facts have been given time
after time and naturally added no new
fact to the inquiry. In giving the cost
expenditures made in development and
Improvement were also included.
Ames was submitted to a close exami
nation, during which it was discovered
that he could not give the cost of the
local distributing system, the Searsvilie
and Pescadero plants. Information re
garding these particulars is considered es
sential, and Mr. Ames jiroir.ised to supply
It in tv.o weeks. He also submitted a
tabulated statement of the receipts, dis
bursements, operating expenses and ex
penditures of the Spring Valley Water
Company for every year since 1SSL lie
yond this Mr. Ames had no informatior.
to give and was excused.
Then there was a search for Hermann
Schussler, the chief engineer of the Spring
Valley Water Company. But Mr. Schuss
ler was not there. Assistant Engineer M.
M. O'Shaughnessy informed the board
that his chief was ill and by the orders
of his physician could not leave his homo
at r.ight. He would be pleased, however,
to meet the members of the board at his
office during daytime.
Mr. O'Shaughnessy was asked Jl bis
chief could not come to the board rooms
during the day. and he replied yes if the
board would give some assurance in ref
erence to the temperature. The assistant
tr.grineer could not be piven the u-ssur
aiice. The board is therefore in a uuan
cary. Mr. Schussler can't go to it and it '
wll not go to him. While he was away I
in Europe. Supervisor Reed suggested, thÂ«i
board had postponed its inquiry in order
t.hat he could give his testimony when he
returned. Now that he has returned he
c;nnot appear before the bonrd. Super
v'sor Connor was appointed a committee
to -wait upon him and see when ne can be
r-'^ent.
tiQSjP*. wltness of th e evening was M.
M. O >haughnessy. who was called to tes
tify la reference to th<? AlameJa an>i Cri
av. ras property of the Spring Valley
Water Ccmpany. After a great deal of
wrangling and argument, he testified that
th9 property was purchased to provide tor
Invert, uses of the city. The ooara then
