JOSEPH LEVY, AN AGED JUNK DEALER MAKES
A STATEMENT TO POLICE IN WHICH HE ADMITS
BUYING FIFTY THOUSAND SACKS FROM WALDEN
AGED JUNK DEALER WHO PURCHASED THE SACKS STOLEN FROM SAN .QUENTIN AND TWO CHECKS HE PAID TO EX-CLERK WALDEN.
TWO INSTRUCTORS WHO FIGURE IN STANFORD'S TROUBLES
Stanford University, Jannssy 17, IOO1.
It vronlii appear from many of the statements heard and seen
of late that, the position of thin university with reference to the
conduct, privileges and opinions of member* of, Hi faculty Is
totally different from that of any other Institution In this conn-.,
try. I recognize the fact that every one connected with, or Inter
ested In the Institution in entitled to know nhnt principles gov
ern Its management. Permit me to clear away, the fog that seems "*;
to have gathered round the subject and to so 'state the uni-,
verslty's position that I trust there can be no possible misun
derstanding it.
The question at Issue In the case of Professor Howard Is
simply this: ARE THE PROFESSORS IX THIS INSTITUTION AT
LIBERTY TO ARRAIG.V THE UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT IN THE
PRESENCE OF THEIR CLASSES?
If such a liberty Is looked upon as academic freedom, then '
I beg to say that such freedom (If that is the word) Is not and
â¢will not be tolerated In this Institution ' so long as It Is under
Its present management.
There Is nothing new about this positions it is no new pol
icy; but it has been annumed from the outset that every one rec
ognlzed the Impossibility of university existence under any other
conditions. ,
There are here, as there are elsewhere, proper . channels
through which all disagreements can be adjusted without over-"
stepping the bounds of official courtesy and . propriety. When
affairs which concern the faculty or the students, either directly'
or indirectly, either Individually or collectively,' require' or seem
to require modification of any kind, It is the duty and the pleas- '
are of the president to hear and consider every complaint and
every suggestion, and every one acquainted 'with him known
that no man is more accessible than President Jordan.

in the same matches for years. Walden
was not a personal friends of his. he saUl,

Mr. Joseph Levy. San Francisco. Cal.
Dear Sirâ Acknowledging the receipt of your
favor of yesterday with check fcr 11373 in pay
ment for 25,000 bags shipped to you on Mon
day last, I herewith return receipted bill for
same. As you request, I will defer shipment
of the other 23M until week after next, and
will notify you in time when the shipment
goes forward. Shall probably be In town bo
fore that, howe\-er. and will drop In to see
you. Tours truly. C. J. WALDEN.
Walden's "bluff" appeared to make th*
prospective purchaser all the more eager.
Levy received the second shipment at the.
same price, as is shown by letters which
he produced. One of the letters follows:
Oct. 10. 1900.
Mr. Joseph Levy. San Francisco, Cal.
. Dear Sirâ The boat, according to present ar
rangement, will come over here to-morrow
(Thursday) about noon, when I will ship the
bags. They win arrive some time during thÂ«
afternoon. I shall ask the captain to notify
you when he gets to'the wharf. Tours truly.
C. J. WALDEN'.
Honey Soils in for Walden.
Money was rolling .nto Walden's pock
ets. He also became so considerate to his
customer Levy that he did not wish him
to mail any more checks. In the'followins
letter Walden relieved Levy r{ that
trouble by stating that he would call per
sonally for the money:
Oct. lL WOO.
Mr. Joseph Levy, San Francisco. Cal.
Dear Sirâ As per my letter of yesterday tha
boat came to-day and took the other 2331
bags for you. Inclosed pleasa find bill for
same. I shall be too busy her* to go to town
this week, but will try and go over either
Tuesday or Wednesday, when I will call anj
get the check. You need not sent it before.
Tours truly. C. J. WALDEK.
On November 1 Walden came to the con
clusion that there was such a thine as
riding a good horse to death and accord
ingly mailed the following letter:
Nov. l. 1300.
Mr. Joseph Levy, San Francisco. Cat.
Dear Sirâ Received yours of Oct. JO. but
doubt If I can arrange with the parties
interested to let you havÂ«Â» any more bass at
present. They appear to want to hold on to
them themselves. However, I will see what
can be done and let you know. Will be over
some time next week after election and seo
- you. â¢ Tours truly. C. J. WALDETN.
Walden wasted but little time cashing
the first check he received. From thj
stamp on the reverse side of the check
on the Donohoe-Kelly Bank it is shown
that Walden cashed It on October IS. th>
day after it was made. The che k. wa<*
indorsed by the firm of Kuhls &
Schwarke. wholesale liquor merchants on
Sutter street.
Lux had bought for farmers. Unfortu
nately the farmers' crops had failed and
consecuently Miller & Lux had no use
for the packs and were anxious to dispose
of them. Levy says he asked Waldnn
how much tne sacks were worth and he
was told that he could get them at the
market value of $5 C5 a hundred. Levy
stated that there was no profit In pur
chasing them at the market value.
Negotiations for Sacks.
Levy told Walden that the only, way
they could do business was on the basis
of $5 50 a hundred sacks. Walden left the
store and stated .that he would do the
best he could. A few days later Levy re
ceived the following letter: \
Mr. Jos. Levy, San Francisco, Cal.
Dear Sir â Tours of yesterday came to hand
this morning, and as the Str. Caroline is mak
ing a special trip this afternoon. I ship you
what twine we have on ' hand â 1 bales. Bill
for same please find Inclosed. In' regard to
the S0M bags we spoke of I had no chance to
go to town since I eaw you last to see the
parties, but they had promised to. let me
know this week. I expect . to hear from them
any time. If not, will take a run over Tues
day or Wednesday and , try ; to ,' get i them for
you. Yours truly,' ' '" .' ' C. J. ' WALDEN. '
': On. Seotember 18 of last -year .Walden
followed up his scheme with the 'following
letter, which is self-explanatory, and
cl"sed tne bargain for the first shipment
of 25.000 sacks: :
Sept. 18, ! 1900.
Mr. Jos. Levy, San Francisco Â¦ Cal. ' -
Dear Sirâ Have managed 'to ploÂ»e bargain
for the 50M bags, â¢ and will Â»nl , them, at. the
first opportunity, but as the lv~t runs -very
Irregularly now, 'can't' tell Just ' when.' -She
may be over to-morrow (Wednesday) and If i
she comes will send you half of them (25M).
I -shall- have to go to town on Thursday and
will call at your - place between 1 and 2 p. m.
Judging from our latest advices, bags are
going upâ I understand quotations now are h%,
for spot and 6V4 for next June. Yours truly, .
C. J. WALDEN..
A letter dated September 24, 1900, was
next furnished by Levy In explanation of
his reason for paying Walden instead of
Miller & Lux by a certified check for the
first shipment. This letter reads: .'
Sept. 24. 1900.
Mr. Jos. Levy, San Francisco, Cal.
Dear Sirâ The boat will make a trip to
night, when I will ship you 23M bags, bill for
which please find Inclosed. They will be at
the wharf ready for you the first thing in the

then send you the other 23M. Yours, truly,

. The next letter Levy . received acknowl
edged' the receipt of $1375. In this letter
During Warden Aguirre's term In office
I>evy further claims that he never bought
a sack from the prison direct, but that
he bought 50,000 bags from Walden under
the following: circumstances, which he
frulrtrtantiates by letters received from
Walden written on the prison stationery:
â¢v'alden, so Levy claims, came to him in
September of last year and told him mat,
sHbeugh he was working as clerk at the
jute mill, he was also represnting the firm
of Miller & Lux. Walden was anxious to
pell a Quantity of sacks In stor6 at San
Cuentln Prison, which, he said. Miller &
Levy, in his statement to Prison Direc
tor Fitrgerald in the presence of Captain
Seymour, said he had known Walden for
peveral years. He knew the clerk of the
jute mill in a business way at San Quen
tin, he continued. On one occasion Levy
said he asked Walden if there was any
thir.j else be could buy around the prison
besides Junk and old clothes and Waldei
Ftated that he had some waste twine and
other stuff from the Jute mill. This all
happened during Warden Hale'a admin
istration. Levy had several business
transactions with those connected with
the prison and everything was most sat

ing for what he bought by check drawn
in favor of Warden Hale.
Levy's Deals With Walden.
THE expose In yesterday's Call
of the peculations of C. J.
Walden, ex-clerk of the San
Quentin jute mill, has result
ed In the discovery of the
channels through which the
embezzler disposed of the
thou5tnds of sacks stolen by him and
shipped to this city from the prison mill.
Joseph Levy, an aged Junk dealer at' â¬2
Clay street, though innocently It so far
appears, received the stolen 50.000 sacks
on their arrival at the Jackson-street
Mh^rf several months ago. Levy's con
r.^sionâor. more mildly, his statement -
Is now in the hands of the police, and
:i<-tinsr on the Information thus g-ained
they will make greater efforts to locate
'h* embezzler.
Early yesterday morning Levy tele
phoned from his place of business to the
Harbor Police Station that he would like
'.<> make a statement to the police. Ser
jeant Ellis responded to the request and
T,evy at once made known his knowledge
of the means employed bv Walrten to dis
pose of the missing sacks-. He stated that
he bought the sacks, showed returned
checks given to Walden in payment, and
prated that he wanted to put himself right
with the police.
At 2 o'clock there was a meeting in Cap
tain Seymour's office in the Hall of Jus
lice between Levy, who Is very aged, his
Boa and Prison Director R. II. Fitzger
ald. Levy offered a plausible explanation
of his connection with the affair and ap
parently wished to air all his business
transactions with Walden. He falle-J.
however, to thoroughly Impress his Inno
cence en Prison Director Fitzgerald, who
stated after the Interview that he would
held Levy responsible for having received
stolen property, and that he would make
him pay Into the State Treasury the full
value of the sacks.

Resolved, by the Assembly of the State of
California, the Senate concurring. That the
Congress of the United States be respectfully
and earnestly requested to Immediately pass
that certain bill known -as "the California
mineral lands bill," and being the same bill
drafted by the Hon. Binger Hermann, Commis
sioner of the General Land Office, and in
dorsed by the Hon. K. A. Hitchcock, Secretary
of the Interior, looking to the classification
and segregation of the mineral lands within
the railroad land grants of the State of Cali
fornia: that the Immediate passage of said bill
is to the utmost degree important; that with
out the relief sought through the bill In ques
tion mineral titles will remain 'unsettled, min
eral rights incapable of satisfactory adjust
ment and the mineral resources within such
grants undeveloped; capital will not seek In
vestment under existing conditions and the
consequent loss to the industrial resources in
this State Is almost incalculable; in short, the
necessity for the desired relief is immediate,
urgent and Imperative.

be directed to . immediately telegraph -these

Mr. Treat followed on the legal aspect
of the bill. He said to his mind the bill
was constitutional, and that it did not
prohibit counties arid cities from making
such local regulations on the subject as
they saw fit. He described pool-selling as
a menace to the moral health of a commu
nity, no matter how or where It was con
ducted, and particularly to the integrity
of employes to whom the temptation to
bet was aggravated by the convenience
of the opportunits*. From an economical
standpoint, he said, the man who accepts

MENTO, Jan. 17.â The Belshaw pool-sell
ing bill was thrashed out before the Sen

Morals this afternoon by a delegation
from Sausalito which came to back up
the measure. There were Archie J. Treat.
Jchn T. Harmes, Francis Avery and Louis
Beedy.' 'All but Beedy were allowed to
address the committee. Their arguments
were cood ones against the selling of
pools on or off tracks, but they were
taken as backing Belshaw's measure.
Belshaw explained his bill, adding some
words on the demoralizing effects* of the
buying and selling of pools, and gave good
reasons why the business should be stop
ped altogether.
dent, but a man who sells pool* gives
nothing but an element of moraJ dangrer
to all his surroundings.
Mr. Hannes spoke of the effect of the
pool-selling business on real estate. In six
years, he said, it had seen values in Saus
allto go down more than 50 per cent, and
there was no compensating advantage.
He declared the poolseilers were a nuia
ance from every standpoint. ,*
Mr. Avery added his teatim-my to what
had been said and then Belsr.&w spok*
again Jn favor of the bill. Knowing noth
ing about the bill, from the arsuments
used in its favor one would have thought
it wiped pool selling from the- facÂ« of the
earth Instead of providing the entering
â¢wedge for Its reappearance upon a suf
fering community.
Bekhaw stated that ho did not believe
the bill would allow the Inrleside track
to be reopened regardless of the wishes
of the people of San Francisco, but in or
der that the measure should not serve as
a prop to any weakening Board of Super
visors he was willing to add a section
reading "Provided that nothing in this
act shall be construed as ~prr>hibitin?
counties, cities and cotmties. cities an.l
towns from prohibiting pool selling with
in their limits should tf.ey see fit." Th.Â»
consideration of the bill by the committee
went no farther than the hearing of m
advocates. It will he caken up again Mon
day, when It is understood more argu
ments will be heard uron It.
It is known in Sacramento to-night that
the committee will report adversely to the
passage of the bill.

money* appropriated. Kaoh commissioner whs
required to file a bond Jn the amount of 110 nno
with the Secretary of State. Each commis

commissioner. The act made $25,000 available
on the paoeaee of thÂ» a*?t and 1103.000 avail

payment of the moneys from section 672 of

that Governor Gage appointed Hons. Ben C

Clieer after cheer followed the adoption
5f this resolution. It was announced that
Dr. Jordan would return to the university
of a discipline necessary to university ef
fpcti\-4?!ie*i> wÂ«Â« ever it stake.
Important as is the statement of acting
President Eranner tt is not more signi
ficant than the action taken by the stu
dent body to-day. The students met an1
with hut a single dissenting voice in per- I
haps U*j men and woir.tn adopted resolu
tions Indorsing the course which Presi
dent Jordan has pursued and expressing
confidence In his wisdom to conduct its
affairs. Early ir. the day a crowd of
angry students threw one of their num
ber, who dared to use insulting words 1n
reference to President Jordan, into a lake
And at night when President Jordan ar
rived at Palo Alto from the south he was
welcomed home by hundreds of cheering
shoutin? students, who escorted him In
triumph to his home.
In this situation, therefore, there H
everything to encourage the friends of
Stanford University.
Students and Faculty in Accord.
Students, faculty and president are lr.
hearty accord. There is nothing to indi
cate that there will be any more resigna
tions snd two of the vacancies have al
ready been filled. While there are som<>
discontented spirits among t/.e- students
they are so few that they play no part of
importance. The experience wUch one of
th<--m suffered to-dav was not such as to
rnciiurage its repetition with anotuer sub
ject. . \ -
Students gathered in thp quadrangle to
flay earlier than usual. Uncertainty, ap
prehension and serious doubt were In the
air. Groups of young men and women
discussed the situation, circulated rumors,
mnvassed what they believed to he the
condition of affairs end planned for their
rr.f-r-ting of the afternoon. Suddenly there
was a commotion In one of the groups.
One of the students, C. D. Montgomery,
had made a romark reflecting upon the
ability and integrity of President Jordan.
Montgomery Is Ducked.
Montgomery has rnly been at Stanford
finre September, when he arrived with
advanced standing from Kansas. As
poon as ho made his startling remark one
"f the Ftudrnts called him aside, osten
s-il'ly to argue with him. Montgomery
was drawn aside out of the quadrangle
and toward a rising ground where there
i? a pmall lake. At the same time about
forty students started for the lake by a
different route. Th^y were there as soon
as jlontgomery and his leader. Seizing
the man from Kansas they bundled him
out on to a lighter and with shouts and
cheers threw him into the lake. In all
haste they then retired and Montgomery,
trenched to the skin, made his way to
his home In Palo Alto.
This incident was a forerunner of what
was to happen at the afternoon mass
rrÂ»ctinjÂ» of the students In Assembly HalL
All the- pians for revolutionary proceed
ings vanished into thin air. The leaders
emong the upper classmen were in con
f'Jltation with the university authorities,
who practically dictated what should be
done while Insisting that they should
neither interfere with the meeting of the
students nor seek to color the expression
of their opinion. The plan to memorialize
Mrs. Stanford and beg her to reinstate
Professor Howard was abandoned and at
1:30 o clock the students met.
Confidence in the President.
Assembly Hall was crowdec." to the
iÂ°Â° ra "â¢- A^ Ia v rack of the senior
rlass presided At the very opening of
the session J. T. Burcham. a graduate in
law of the university, introduced a series
of resolutions denouncing- the trick of
wme unknown students who had placard
?r] the Stanford group in the quadransrle
The resolutions wre greeted with cheers
snd were unanimously adopted In a scene
af enthusiasm Â¦which has had few paral
lels even at Stanford.
Charles Schwartzkopf of the senior class
then aroso for the important business of
the afternoon. He called attention to the
.'act that students as well as the faculty
:>f Stanford were facing a most serious
end critical emergency. He paid a sincere
tribute to Professor Howard and to those
who had followed him into exile, but he
tagged his fellow students to see the wis
5om of supporting a higher and greater
?ower than Professor Howard. .For that
reason he introduced the following reso
lution, xrhich was adopted with but a sin
fle dissenting vote:
Prison Director Wilkins of San Rafael
and Warden Aguirre arrived In the city
early yesterday morning to take steps to
locate Walden'fi confederate. Wilkins
claims that the two made public are not
all of Walden's offenses. He claims the
abrfr :ding jute mill clerk must have been
systematically robbing the prison. He
has Instructed Warden Aguirre to retain
the book experts and instruct them to go
through Walden's accounts from the time
he entered the prison until the day he
mysteriously disappeared.
The story of Walden's embezzlements
created as great a sensation in San Ra
fael as It did In this city. Walden had a
large circle of friends in San Rafael. He
was also a prominent member of the
Marin Rifle Club and the members of the
organization were amazed when the news
was published that Walden had again
strayed from the path of honesty
In this city there was a certain extent of
sympathy expressed for Joseph Levy and
he was given full credit for coming for
ward and making his statement to the
police. But, on the other hand, it will be
difficult for -him to explain how it was
that he failed to suspect Walden when he
offered for sale immense quantities of lute
bags at a figure far below their market
value. . Â¦ .. .
Eot All of Walden's Offenses.
IMrector Fitzgerald's Views.
'I have heard all that Levy has to say."
said Fitzgerald. "He has some very
plausible statements tc make. I cannot
help saying, though, that I consider him a
very poor business man to have placed so
much confidence In Walden. Levy had
formerly been In the habit of doing all his
business direct with the prison and I can
not understand why he should have sud
denly switched off to trade with Walden.
"I shall make It my business to see that
the prison does not lose a cent by this
transaction. I understand that Mr. Levy
Is far from a poor man and wÂ© shall im
mediately take steps to recover the pric<Â»
of the sacks. I myself feel certain that
Walden committed only the .wo embez
zlements which have been made publi".
His books show no other discrepancies.
Where the man is gone I don't know."
Levy last night said that he was entire
ly innocent and that he has come out and
tried to prove that he was an Innocent
party to the affair. He claims he thought
Walden was acting in good faith and he
believed he was reaJly buying sacks
w^"^ sold by the Prison officials to
Miller & Lux. When told there would be
action taken against him by the Prison
Directors to recover the value of the
sacks, it did not appear to - worry Levy
very much, as he volunteered the state
ment that "they could go on and sue."
Prison Director Fitzgerald is very bitter
against Walden. When seen yesterday
he referred to the absconder as "an iiÂ«
grate of the worst kind." The most point
ed statement Fitzgerald makes is that h?
will make I^evy pay the full value of the
sacks whether or not ne was cognizant oi
the fact that he was buying stolen prop
erty.
and had only been in the Sutter-street
establishment once previous to the time
he reauested Kuhls to indorse the check.
On October IS Walden called at "the stor-?
and, displaying the check, stated that he
was afraid that he would be unable to
cash It unless he was identified. Kuhls,
on being asked by Walden to accompany
him to the bank, consented. He has never
seen Walden since. . The seend check
Levy indorsed himself.

nationality of the Duke. Here is a dif
ficulty, for the Duke wishes to become a
Netherlander, but at the same time to re
tain his own nationality. This is con
trary to Dutch law, and should the
Duke persist all arrangements for the
marriape may fall through. The Duke Is

vember 20. that he wished him to stay and
that he would not insist upon his resigna
tion unless Mrs. Stanford demanded it, he
answered:
"I merely meant to convey to Dr. How
ard my willingness to forgive him for
his infraction of the most common rules
of discipline. This was conditioned of
couree upon some sort of apology from
him. Since no such apology came I had
| but one course left open to me."
It will thus be seen that President Jor-
I dan accepts the entire responsibility for
Dr. Howard's dismissal, and that Mrs.
Stanford had absolutely nothing to do
with the matter.
President Jordan was highly gratified
by the hearty reception given him by the
students and feels that their decided
stand on the matter will do much to quiet
the situation.
Professor Duniway's Stand.
The students In the history seminary
this afternoon appointed a committee to
draft resolutions expressing their regret
at the resignation of Dr. Howard and
their keen appreciation of his worth both
ss a man and as a teacher. Professor
Clyde A. Duniway, who is the acting head
of the history department and the only
man there in it since Professor Spencer's
resignation, made public his statement ex
plaining his position fully. It is as fol
lows:
To the students of Stanford University: The
pn*Â«?nt extraordinary condition In the history
department seems to require some public state
ment. However unwilling a professor should
be to dlscups personal academic relations in
the newspapers. It may be useful to depart
from the rule of silence In such an emergency.
Several considerations deserve categorical no
tice.
FlrM-The rights of academic freedom are
fundamental in a university. No self-respect
ing man will consent* to have this freedom,
limited as the price of continuance In his uni
versity position. Despite recent events it is
Btill possible for a professor to' continue his
connection with Stanford University and retain
his freedom unabridged. CordlaJ assurance Is
given that the authorities will follow an en
lightened polio'. On all proper occasions, and
in every proper manner, the faculty of this
university, from the president to the humblest
member, muet and ', will voice their opinions.
Second â The men who have recently resigned
from this faculty are worthy of. all honor for
devotion to convictions of â¢duty. But the dif
ficult and complicated problems at issue pre-'
pent questions for every Individual to solve
for himself. There are many right solutions,
perhaps as many as there are individuals to
determine them. The men who remain at their
posts and continue their labors for the uni
versity may be able to serve the great cause
of learning and freedom Just as truly as those
who have chosen to make the strongest public
protest of which they are capable.
Thirdâ Continuance in official relations with
the university does not necessarily imply in
dorsement of measures of the administration.
Many of the faculty. Juet how many is un
known, believe that the dismissal of Dr. Ross
was an act of Injustice to him and of serious
detriment to the best interests of the univer
sity. Many believe, too, that thÂ« forced resig
nation of Dr. Howard was another grievous
error. Yet those of u* who hold and express
tree* opinions, and who still are willing to
do our work, do not feel stultified on that
account. We are using our legitimate freedom.
Fourth â There cannot be two opinions as to
the great loss suffered by the university
through the resignation of Dr. Howard. His
scholarship is most thorough. His executive
capacity has been a positive force, not only
In departmental matters, but also in university
affairs at large. His devotion to the interests
of his etudents has. been most unselfish. His
enthusiasm and moral power have been a tower
of strength. His downright honesty, his warm
ger.erwlty, bis high sense of honor are wholly
admirable. His colleagues revere him an an
Inspiring leader. . Ills Kudenta are his dis
ciples and loving friends. His work and his
Ideals will live In " Stanford University long
after his departure. All will yet be well with
this university and with the department he
served so devotedly If those of us who remain
can be true to his purposes.' - â¢
Finallyâ The work of the history department
Is not to be abandoned. â¢ Its students. Its per
eeverlr.g members of Â¦ Its faculty, new instruc
tors who may come to nerve here, all should
Accepts Responsibility.
When asked how he harmonized his ulti
mate dismissal of Dr. Howard with his
statement made to Dr. Howard on No-
"When seen later at his residence Dr.
Jordan was not willing to enter into an
extended discussion. He was worn by his
trip up from Los Angeles and wished to
have time to review the situation in its
latest phases before committing himself
fully. However, he was willing to an
swer the two questions which are of the
most interest to the public. Dr. Jordan
was first asked:
"Why did you wait so long after Dr.
Howard's outburst before requesting his
resignation?"
"I did not want to make any mistake,"
he replied. "Furthermore. I wished to
give Dr. Howard all the time I could, con
sistently, hoping that he would put him
self in such relation with the university
authorities as would make it possible for
me to retain him."
"Were you influenced by Mrs. Stanford
in forcing Dr. Howard to resign?"
"No." answered Dr. Jordan. "Mrs.
Stanford knew nothing of Dr. Howard's
dismissal until I cabled It to her."
Dr. Jordan Explains.
at night, and by common consent the stu
dents decided to meet him at the train
and welcome him home. The meeting
then adjourned.
Late in the afternoon Acting President
Dr. Branner declared that there would be
practically no interruption in the courses
taught by the professors who have re
signed. Professors Warren and Lapsley
of Harvard have accepted the positions
offered them in the department of his
tory and will be at Stanford within a
week.
President David Starr Jordan was met
at the station In Palo Alto on his return
by a crowd of 500 students, who had wait
ed two hours without supper that they
might express their gratification at his
return. His reception lacked nothing in
enthusiasm. Roman candles cast a lurli*
glare over the crowd as the overland
train, nearly five hours late, pulled into
the station.
As President Jordan emerged from the
car he was greeted with hearty cheers and
assured by half a thousand voices that
he was "all right." He was hurried
through the crowd and driven to his home
so quickly that the plan of the students to
unhitch the horses and draw his carriage
with their own hands was averted.

years, together with the plan they have
adopted for putting accumulated wealth
into great co-operative syndicates or
trusts for the purpose of carrying on this
great commercial warfare, are perhaps
the most formidable.
"On the other hand, the Germans, with
their calculating and conquering spirit
and the energy with which they seize and
use the best and most economical meth
ods, are but less redoubtable than the
Americans.
"The Americans, scarcely satisfied with
gigantic individual fortunes, use these by
combination to make of capital a power
which, wielded by one or two minds, is
almost irresistible, and if this power is
concentrated ngainst Great Britain in
trade warfare it will be a danger we can
not afford to disregard. A trust of many
millions might compete with any trade In
England, underselling all her products at
a considerable loss. This is a possible out
come of the immediate future.
"A curious feature, if I may say so with
out impertinence, seems to be that in
combination with the faculty for the ac
quisition of money there is a complete
contempt for money except as a means of
making more and for power. These mil
lionaires of whom we hear so much are
often men of simple lives, whose simple
rule is to make enough accumulations in
order to acquire more power.
"England. In order to withstand inter
national competition, must thoroughly
educate her youth, and I would suggest
sending batches of young men abroad to
learn the best our rivals know."
Lord Rosebery prefaced his declarations
regarding commercial warfare with the
following observations:
"The enormous and constantly increas
ing armament of Europe may be the
means of preserving peace. In the first
place, this may be so because war is an
operation of such incalculable Importance,

LONDON, Jan. 18.â Lord Roberts, who
was entertained privately at dinner last
evening by the United Service Club, the
guests including the Prince of Wales, the
Duke of York, the Duke of Cambridge
and some three hundred officers, has is
sued from the War Office a stirring ap
peal to the country for a prompt re
sponse to the call for 5000 yeomanry,
whose past services he highly commenis
to the gratitude of the nation.
The authorities continue to hold a hope
ful view regarding the South African sit
uation, but they seem to recognize that
vigorous measures are necessary.
The proclamation of -martial law
throughout almost the whole of Cape Col
ony, Lord Kitchener's strong measures
against the population of the republics,
the placing on reduced rations the
wives of men in the field and similar,
measures go to show that there is heavy
work. , *
British offensive operations have ceased
tor the present. It is supposed that Lord
Kitchener Is collecting his strength for a
final effort to crush or to capture the f
commandos by a repetition -of the tactics'
which caused the surrender of General
Cronje and General Prinzloo.
It is alleged that the Boers who are
concentrating at Carolina'and Ermole are
preparing to descend into Natal.
The casualty list issued yesterday shows
that the Boers have released 297 British
who were captured at Helvetia and Bel
fast. The facts regarding the captures
at Belfast have not been allowed to
transpire.
It is asserted that more heavy naval

of Cape Town, Simonstown, Wynberg,

also tteen proclaimed in Tombuland, Grl
qulland East and In East and West Pon
doland. It has been proclaimed unlawful
for any person in the Cape peninsula, ex
cept officials and regular or order troops,
to possess arms and ammunition or either.
A Pretoria special says: Boer families
and their stock are being systematically
brought into convenient centers from all
over the country. They are kept in camps
and fed. Those who surrender voluntarily
are supplied with full rations, and those
whose husbands are still in the field are
provided for on a reduced scale, but raiBed
when the husbands surrender to' a full
allowance.
BOERS LOSE HEAVILY.
Make Two Unsuccessful Attacks on
, Col ville's Column.
STANDERTON, .Wednesday. Jan. 16.â
Colvtlle's mobile column, marching from
New-Denmark to Vladlaagte, was attack
ed by 1000 Boers, divided into two forces.
One force made a determined attempt on
the bf.ggage and the other on the cav
alry constituting the rear guard. The cav
alry were compelled to retire until pro
tected by four companies of rifles, hidden
behind a ridge, who were waiting with
bayonets. 'The Boers then made a speedy
retreat, leaving several dead and wounded
from the Â»heavy British fire/
Eventually both attacks were repulsed,
the Beers losing heavily. The British were
not able to pursue the Boers owing to the
necessity of protecting their baggage.
Their casualties were one killed and fif
teen wounded.
gurrs will be landed at the Cape. Infor
mation as to the doings of the invaders
is hard to obtain, but it is clear that they
are getting very* little help from the
Dutch. Twice they attempted to capture
Barkley East, but both times they were
repulsed. For three days they occupied
Sutherland, but they cleared out on the
approach- of a British column. I Small
scattered parties are reported operating
in various parts of the Ceres district. Ap
parently the. invaders abandoned the idea
of attacking Clanwllliam on finding the
town well defended. A commando of IOiXJ
has been active in the Richmond district,
but there the Boers have secured only
100 Dutch recruits.
The stop-the-war committee to-day is
sued a statement saying:
"Orders which a British officer reports
he received reveal the adoption by Lord
Roberts and Lord-Â»Kitchener of a policy
having for its aim the extermination of- a
heroic nationality by starving its women
and children and the deliberate massacre
of unarmed prisoners."
ThÂ© latter clause alludes to General
Kitchener's alleged secret orders to Gen
eral Dewet's pursuers to" take no pris
oners. - - .-Â¦.:--. / ; ,
Copies of letters from; an unnairieU Brit
ish army officer containing these and other
charges will be sent by the committee to
Lord Salisbury. Lord. Roberts and others.
A Standerton special says; Boer women
brought In. by-the_milltary - report that
William Steyn. who was appointed a dele
gate of the Boers here to ask the fighting
Boers to surrender under Lord Kitchener's
proclamation, was made a prisoner and
sent to Pletrewiff, accused of high trea
son. The Boers are still active around
Standerton.
A special from Cape Town says: Mar

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â This was an
exceedingly dull day in the House. The
entire day was spent upon the bill to re
vise and codify- the postal laws, which is
to be the continuing order, not, however,
to interfere with, appropriation bills or
conference reports, until disposed of. It
is a bill of 221 pag-es and is simply a re
vision of the existing laws. Some disposi
tion was manifested to inject into the
measure some amendments to the present
law in the interest of certain classes of
mail employes, but such attempts were
successfully resisted. Ninety-three pages
of the bill were completed to-day.
The House, without preliminary busi
ness, went into committee of the whole,
Lawrence of Massachusetts in the chair.
Loud of California, in charge of the bill,
made a brief explanation of the provisions
of the measure and explained In answer tb
many inquiries thuit the bill made no mod
ification of existing statutes regarding
railway mail,' salaries of railway mall
clerks or any of the mooted questions re
garding the postal service.
The bill was then read for amendment
under the five-minute rule. Hepburn of
Iowa moved to strike out the provisions
requiring: that the four Assistant Post
masters General should be confirmed by
the Senate. Hepburn paid the confirma
tion of those officials bylhe Senate simply
crippled the appointing power of the PreB
ident and placed it in the- power of the
Senators to "hold up"- the executive in
the matter of appointments. The amend
ment was lost.
W. A. Smith offered an amendment to
classify letter carriers as first, second,
third and- fourth class and pay them' at
the rate of $1200. $1000. $800 and $600 per an
num respectively. He made an impas
slonedxppeech In support of the amend
ment, which he said would do only scant
Justice to one of the most deserving class
of Government employes. Mahon, Repub
lican, of Pennsylva ila, replied with an
equally earnest appe-al against Increasing;
the salaries of Government employes. He
declared that for the same class of work
the letter carriers were the best paid men
in the nation. Loud urged that the pre
sentation â¢ of such an amendment to the
pending bill was Inopportune, but said he
was willing to allow the proposition to go
to a vote without debate. The vote re
sulted: Ayes 19. noes 33.
Smith made the point of no quorum. -
The committee then rose and at 5:45 the
House adjourned.

and Fuch substantial progress was made
That It is likely an adjournment will be

original programme. The following me
morial to the Senate of the United States
was adopted:
To the Honorable the Senate of the United
States: Your orator, the National Livestock
Association, respectfully represents unto your
Jionorable body that It is an association com
lÂ«sed of one hundred and twenty-six livestock
and kindred organizations, all directly inter
ested in the production, marketing and dispo
sition of livestock, and whose holdings thereof
represent an investment of over JGOO.OOO.OOO.
Tour orator. In annual ppsslon arsembled at
t=a.lt Lake City, Utah, Quires to enter its em
1'hatlc i>rot<*st against the enactment of what
la commonly known as the Grout bill ili. B.
"17). and in behaJf of its protest desires to
j-eeord a few of the many reasons in support'
<jf its contention.
This measure is a species of clans legislation
of the roost lniqultuu.* and dangeroui kind.
<aJculated to build up one industry at the ex
jHjnse of another equally as important. It
i-'-Â« Ks to impone an urjust, - uncalled for and
unwarranted burden upon one of the principal
Industries of the country for the purpose of
prohibiting: itÂ» manufacture, thereby destroying
competition, as the manufacturers cannot as
sume the additional uuidens sought to be Im
posed by this rm-asure and > sell their product
!n comj>etltlon with butter.
The passage of this law would destroy the
demand, except for export, of that product of
the beef animal, oleo oil, of which 24,000.000
pounds was used during the year 1839 In the
manufacture of oleomargarine, and would also
â¢erlously injure the hog industry by a similar
destruction of the demand, except for ex
port, of neutral lard. 31.QuG.0uG pounds of which
â¢was used In the year 1*!"9 in the manufacture
Â«>f this food product, and by thus eliminating
the demand for these legitimate articles of
commerce force dealers to seek other channels
for their disposition at greatly reduced prices,
thereby entailing a loss to the producers of
IIâ Hitlt of the I_'nit?'J States of millions of
rf. 'liars annually.
The measure seeks to throttle competition,
*nd if enacted will render useless the im
mense establishments Â« rected at great expense
fÂ«tr the manufacture of oleomargarine, deprive
thousands of employes of opportunity to gain
*Â¦. livelihood and deny the people and especially
the workingnien and their dependencies of a
wholet-ome article of diet. In oleomargarine
â¢ vÂ«*ry large proportion of the consumers of
this country, especially the working classes,
r>p.ve a wholesome, nutritious and satisfactory
article of diet, which, before its advent, they
were r.bliped. owing tc the hiplt price of but
tei* and their limited means, to go without.
Tour orator contends that it is manifestly
unjust, unreasonable and unfair to deny manu
tmturers of the product of thf. beef animal
and the heg the same privileges in regard to
the use of coloring matter thai are accorded
thr manufacturers of the proiurt of the dairy,
;. ; 1 that the rights and privileges of the pro
ducer* of cattle and hogs should be as well
rÂ»4-pÂ«-cted 'as those of otlrtrs, and as they are
Â»1'Â» beneficiaries in the manufacture of this
wholesome article of food they should not be
burdened with unnecessary and oppressive spe
Â«!Â«1 taxe* or needless restrictions in <h; manu
facture of this product, other than Is abso
lutely necestary for the support of the Gov
ernment and the. proper srevt-j nmental regula
tirpn surrounding the handling of the same.
Your orator respectfully contends that these
products should recei.-e at the hands of Oon
Â«rrets no greater exactions than those imposed
upon competing food products, and that the
n anufacture and sale of oleomargarine is al
ready surrounded by numerous safeguards,
which Congress to Its wisdom has seen fit to
(irovide. rtipulatin* severe punishment for sell
n? t)ie same v:-A r misrepresentation as to
its composition. aT~d that this product has by
i experience rroven to be jwt what a large
majority of the people of this country want,
and that none but the dairy and allied inter
ests are asking for or peeking any further
I- eolation In this matter and their indorse
ment of the proposed legislation Ik purely- and
simply selfish.
In <-onciuflon your (Orator, In behalf of the

silemnly protest* against the enactment of the
Orout bill or of any other legislation calcu

The discussion -of the Grout bill, which
was before the convention when adjourn
ment was taken yesterday, was then
taken up.
At the afternoon session a number of
resolutions from the executive committee
were read and acted upon.
The question of sheep-grazing on forest
reserve." was brought up In a resolution,
which *-xprÂ»Â»f"sed the sense of the conven
tion that the forest reserves should be
thrown open lor the prrazinp of sheep,
rattle and horte?. under careful restric
tion and safeguards as would prevent any
injury to forests.
The matter of uniform Inspection was
brought up through a subcommittee of
the executive committee, which reported
that It was found that the Patrick bill,
looking to the establishment of uniform
inspection, was the most commendable
for the purpose indicated . The report
wrf inrorped by the convention.
The question of land' leasing was
brought up In majority and minority re
ports which made no special recommenda
tion, and on motion of Cowan of Texas
both reports were laid on the table, the
effect being to eliminate the matter from
the proceedings of the convention.
Colonel John P. Irish of California and
ex-Een^tor Carey of Wyoming delivered
addrespep on <he question of land leasing
and the livestock Industry. :
It was; proposed to raise a fund of JJO.OOO
to fight the Grout bill. SubFcrlptions were
opened and $8G09 subscribed. Plodpes were
made sufficient to make the amourh pood.

IN OPPOSITION
TO GROUT BILL
THE latest scheme for bringing
hordes of cheap laborers from
Asia to the American conti
nent surpasses In Its reach all
enterprises of a 'similar char
acter hitherto planned. 'Â¦ In
brief, the promoters of the
scheme have obtained from
the Government of Mexico a vast eonees
fIod of fishing privileges and lands adja
cent to the fishing grounds. They propose
to bring a million Chinese to Mexico and
*"Ftablls,h fisheries, canneries and ware
houses all along the Mexican coast.
Yesterday information reached The Call
to the effect that special efforts were be
ing: made to Induce rich Chinese merchants
lo invest their money in the stock of -the
Pacific Charter Company. Alluring cir
cular* were distributed to leading mer
rhants. Inquiry disclosed the fact that
njjents claiming to represent M. F.'Tar
pey, the well-known Democratic states
man and ardent advocate of exclusion doc
trine, were soliciting rich merchants 'in
<"hinatown to subscribe to the capital
nock of the new company.
When it was considered that an exclu
sion act to exclude Chinese in Mexico
from coming into California could not be
enforced without the assistance of an
army of watchers or patrolmen. The Call
<lcrmed the story worthy of diligent inves
tigation. It was ascertained as an inci
dent Of the inquiry that a new steamship
c-onrpany was recently organized. Articles
of Incorporation were filed- in the County
Clerk's office December 15, 1900^ The term
The purposes of the company are: First
âThe building, ownership, and
operation of oceanic steamships and for
the conducting of lines thereof, between
ports of various countries of the world.
Secondâ For the building, ownership,
chartering and operation of coastwise
steamships and for I the conducting of'
lines thereof along the coasts . or in the
waters of various countries of the world.
Articles four and five provide for the
transportation of passengers and freight
and for the buying, selling, dealing in and
trading in all kinds ot merchandise. The
remaining articles dtal with the general
business of the companyt including the
.making of contracts, negotiating loans,
purchase of Inventions, etc. /
The designs of the new company, not
being fully disclosed in the official articles
of incorporation, Tha Call obtained a copy
I of the circular printed in Chinese char-
I acters and procured a translation thereof.

shares of the par value of $25 each. The
amount of stock actually subscribed is
$125, each of the Incorporators holding one

Mexico Is fully set forth In a style cal
culated to excite the admiration of the
dullest Chinese coolie. The-climate of
Mexico is extolled. The fishing grounds
are declared to be the finest In the world,
and a hint is conveyed that Mr. Tarpey
knows all the good fishing places.
'Mention is made "of the significant fact
that the promoter of the Pacific Charter
Company jand , President Diaz are close
friends, and as a result of that friendship
the Chinese will be welcomed to Mexico.
Following is a- free translation of the
circular:
"The Pacific Charter Company proposes
on behalf 'of the Mexican Government to
encourage Chinese as well as Europeans
to come to Mexico and. have special priv
ileges. At present there is but very little
commerce between Mexico . and Asia and
a new "steamship company is needed to
take hold of the' trade and .build it up.
The Pacific Charter Company of. Mexico
has made a contract to open a new steam
ship line between Mexico and China and
all goods from Mexico to China will be
shipped on this line.

Special IMspatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., s WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.âConsider
ation is being given by the President and
Secretary Hay to instructions to be
cabled to Minister Conger for his guid
ance in the negotiations for a permanent
settlement of the Chinese question. As
Â¦practically determined upon, the pro
gramme to be followed in the negotia
tions contemplates the immediate car
rying out by the Chinese Government
of the demands which require no further
discussion; the determination of extent of
and method of punishment of responsible
authors of Chinese outrages; the amount
and method of payment of indemnity;
and finally the revision of the treaties
with China. Discussion relative to the
punishment will relate to the ability of
China to impose harsher punishments
than she will probably propose, and the
designation of a committee of allies to be
present when the punishment is inflicted.
This Government is still In favor of the
foreign Ministers agreeing upon the
amount of indemnity' China shall pay,
after which the foreign, Ministers will
distribute it among the allies, failing
which distribution is to be made by The
Hague Commission.
It has not yet been determined whether
the treaties shall be revised by each
nation separately or by the nations joint
ly, aa this matter will have to be settled
by direct negotiation between the powers.

ferred with Governor Sayers, Attorney

While the bill necessitates "contiguous
and compact" Congressional districts, it
will still be* possible for Legislatures to
redistriet the States as they see fit
within their limitations. Districts may
be geographically of irregular formation,
yet contiguous and compact. The amend
ment was intended primarily to prevent
outrageous gerrymandering in certain
Southern States where very long; circuit
ous and narrow districts were. carved out
for the purpose of including within the'r
limits as much as possible of the negro
vote. The bill was passed by the Senate
unanimously and without debate. -
WASHINGTON, Jan. lf.-The reappor
tlonment bill as passed by Congress con
tains a provision In the. form of an
amendment offered by the committee and
adopted in the House which will prevent
the worst form of gerrymandering of
Congressional districts," but not necessar
ilydo away altogether with that prac
tice. The amendment adopted to regu
late the formation of Congressional dis
tricts requires that "the^r shall be" of
compact and contiguous territory and as
nearly as practicable of equal number, of
inhabitants." -The purpose of the
amendment was to prevent the formation
of so-called "shoestring" districts and
other extreme forms of gerrymandering.
The ' amendment was objected to by
many Republicans and Democrats alike
on the grounds that- Congress had no
power to legislate on the subject. It was
contended, that the power of Congress
was I limited to the I apportioning ! of Rep
resentatives among the: several Status
and ; could not control the division oÂ£
States into districts. That power rested
with the States alone. " The amendment
was nevertheless adopted by a vote of 12'J
to 110.

DEMONSTRATION IN HONOR OF SEATING
MATTHEW STANLEY QUAY OF PENNSYLVANIA
accused the late Oscar Booz of feigning
to read his Bible when he had a novel
hidden inside the cover. After a long ex
amination by the committee, Prentice said
he believed he was mistaken, and Booz
might have been reading a lesson leaf or
a supplement to the Bible.
The other and more important witness
was Cadet Douglas MacArthur, of whom
the probers after facts about hazing had
heard a great deal since they came
here. MacArthur stoutly denied that he
had ever fainted or become unconscious
from violent exercising and insisted that
he had not been treated any more harshly
than his tentmate and several otfier class
mates. MacArthur's examination will be
resumed when the committee meets again
at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.
When the committee resumed its session
Cadet James Prentice of New York was
called to the witness stand. Congressman
Wanger handed him a copy of the record
of the Military Court of Inquiry and asked
him to read the report of the testimony
which he gave at the military investiga
tion. After he had read it over. Prentice
was sworn and said that, with the excep
tion of a few typographical errors, the re
port was correct.
Prentice is the cadet who is responsible
for the report that former Cadet Booz had
secreted a novel inside of an open Bible
and was readins it. while, to all appear
ances, he was perusing the other book.
General ' Dick questioned the witness
closely In reference to this assertion. The
witness said that the book was a paper
covered French novel, but later on the
general made him admit that he could
not swear positively that it was. He also
had to acknowledge that it mighV have
possibly been a lesson leaf or a supple
ment to the Bible.
"To whom did you tell this?" *
"Mr. Burnett."
"He is the president of the cadet branch
of the Young Men's Christian Assocla
"Yes, sir."
"When did you tell him?"
"While the cadet football team was in
Philadelphia, on the first day of last De
cember."
"So you kept this incident to yourself
for over two year6 until you heard that
Mr. Booz was dead or dying?"
"Yes, sir."
"What brought up the recollection of
the episode?"
"We were all reading about Booz's
charges in the Philadelphia newspapers."
"What charges?"
"He had stated that he was killed by
the hazing he received In this academy."
rep4.ed the witness, who evidently did not
see the "bull" he made.
The witness told of being hazed by Ca
det Foy during his first year at the acad
emy. He was sick during the day prior
iÂ« being hazed, and after he had done
twelve eagles he became faint and told
Foy that he had been 111. Foy let up on
him and scolded him for not telling of his
illness before.
"This," said Prentice, "made me very
careful ever since If I was hazing a man.
I never Interfered with a delicate looking
cadet. Booz was not a strong looking
man. and I always had a friendly feeling
for him and tried to advise him for the
better." â¢;
While making this statement Prentice
was visibly affected and his voice broke.
He seemed to be on the verge of breaking
down when In answer to General Dick he
said: "If I had known anything about It
beforehand I should never have allowed
Booz to be called out. I considered that
he was not physically fit to take part in a
fight."
Under Judge Smith's questioning the
witness became confused in describing the
difference between the spoken lie and the
Â¦acted lie in reference to "deadbeating" to
avoid hazing and "deadbeatlng" through
alleged devotional reading or exercise. The
witness was forced to admit that the book
he saw in Booz's Bible might have been
a religious publication. /
Before dismissing the witness General
Dick said: "Now, turning back to your
own experience as a fourth class man.
don't you think that a kindly hand and
an encouraging word from an upper class
man to a fourth class man would have
been a more beneficial one upon the plebe
than the rude, rough hazing to which he
is subjected?"
"Yes, sir; I believe It would," said the
cadet.
Congressman Wanger congratulated the
witness for the considerate manner in
which he had treated Booz in not report-
Ing him at times when he had an oppor
tunity.
Cadet Douglas MacArthur followed
Prentice on the stand.
Driggs, addressing him, said:
"Mr. MacArthur, we have had a mass
of testimony given here regarding the fact
of your having been hazed so violently
that you had convulsions. The commit
tee is desirous of having you tell in your
own way the manner ln which you were
hazed, the forms of hazing, the names of
the men who hazed you and the conse
quences."
MacArthur replied: "I had been about
a month in the summer camp of 1893 as a
'plebo' when the hazing, an account of
Â¦which I have read in the papers, occurred.
Like most reports of the kind, it was a
small affair, greatly exaggerated after
ward. My treatment was no more severe
than that given to others, and was in no
way calculated to place me in a severe
physical condition. I had no convulsions:
that report is entirely erroneous. I had
what you might call aggravated cramps
and lout control of my muscles. I most
emphatically deny that I was seized with
convulsions. I was not delirious nor out
of my mind. â¢
."The hazing took place in A Company
street. It was not my own tent: there
were other men there â Farnum. Haskill
and Cunningham, my tentmates. There
was a soiree and several of my classmates
were hazed on that occasion. The soiree
lasted about an hour. I got about 250
eagles, hung on the stretcher for two
minutes at a time and did some dips. It
was a very warm night and I had been
feeling 'undÂ«r the weather' all day and
was rather weak. Jt. was dark when the
soiree began and I - perspired profusely,
but by 'taps' I was**all right again."
"Did you consider the treatment you re
ceived cruel at the time." asked Driggs,
who read the definition of the word from
a dictionary. Â¦ Â«
'you still regard it &a orutlT*

T>ick decided to postpone any further
tearing of testimony until to-morrow.
Four witnesses wore examined to-day.
The first was Cadet Prentice, who had
"Xow, tell us the names of the men who
were hazing you."
"Cadets Dockery and Barry."
Driggs tried to get MacArthur to admit
that he was seriously upset by the violent
exercises he was required to go through,
but the witness would not. He main
tained that he had cramps in the muscles
and had lost control of them. He denied
that cotton had been stunted In his mouth.
MacArthur was very positive ln his de
nials and the committeemen looked to be
very much surprised at the stand he was
taking.
SENATORS DE1TOT7NCE HAZING.
West Point Methods.
Vigorous Words by Statesmen on
WASHINGTON. Jan.^ 17.-Durlng the
day's session in the Senate the army re
organization bill was discussed at length
by Money (D.) of Mississippi, McComas
(R.) of Maryland and Bate (D) of Ten
nessee. The Mississippi Senator devoted
some attention to the practice of hazing
at West Point, which he bitterly de
nounced.
At 12:45 Foraker moved that the Sen
ate proceed to the consideration of exec
utive business.
Pettigrew protested that the motion
ought not to be pressed, as it was In vio
lation of a tacit understanding that the
army bill should remain under considera
tion until the vote'shall have been taken,
and Foraker withdrew his motion, Jones
of Arkansas appealing to him to do so.
Consideration of the army bill was then
resumed. Money of Mississippi speaking
ln opposition to the measure. He attack
ed that portion of the bill which confers
upon the President the discretionary pow
er to increase the strength of the army
as an abdication of authority' by Congress
that was unwarranted and inexcusable.
He admitted that the people did vote at
the November election ln favor of the
Republican policies. Including perhaps
that for a large army.
"But," said he, "is there to be no such
faith ln human nature as will suppose
that the people will not after a while have
a lucid interval?"
He argued that the people after realiz
ing the power placed ln the executive by
the pending bill and realizing that they
were to be saddled with a permanent
standing army of 100,000 men would re
verse the present conditions of things.
Money adverted vigorously to the prac
tice of hazing at the West Point Military
Academy, declaring it must be stopped or
the Institution must be abolished. He
said nobody could induce him to believe
that the way to make a good soldier was>
to "set a great big bully" upon a small
man to beat him. He did not refer, he
said, to horse play or practical jokes, but
to mob violence and cowardly brutality.
"I cannot understand," said Money,
"the motives of a lot of young men, all of
them schoiars of charity, who are paid
for taking their education, who get to
gether and mob another young man,
whose only crime la that he arrived at
West Point two or three years later than
they."
He declared that the man who hazed
others at the military academy would be
a tyrant and a despot with the men of his
command after he received his coramls
sion. He did nor believe "that the cadets
realized th^ contempt in which th<Â»ir ac
tions was held by the American pe'sple.
The practices there, he declared, must -be
abated.
"I think the Senator will be satisiied,"
interjected Proctor, one of the members
of the Military Affairs Committee, "when
he sees the West Point bill which will be
reported in a day or two."
Money, continuing, said: "And I do not
want to stop at the boys. Any officer or
instructor at West Point who counte
nances or winks at this practice of haz
ing ought to be dishonorably discharged
from the service."
McComas of Maryland, while giving the
pending army bill his approbation, be
lieved It ought to be amended ln some re
spects. He argued in favor of eliminating
the age limit as applied to the appoint
ment of officers in the regular army from
the volunteer service, urging that the
President be given discretion to appoint
any competent officer, irrespective of age
He. too, denounced hazing at West Point
Bate of Tennessee opposed the pending
bill not only because it conferred upon the
President authority which he thought
ought to be exercised only by Congress
but also because it created a permanent
standing &V.ny of 100,000 men. He urged
that it the regular army was increased
to IOO.vOO men it would never be reduced
in strength, as all powerful influences, so
cial and political, would work to prevent
the reduction. The building up of this
army and the authority conferred upon
the President by this bill, he said, were
the" longest strides ever taken in this
country toward "Imperialism."
Penrose addressed the Senate briefly in
support of an amendment he offered,
striking out of the bill all limitations of
age as applied to appointments of officers
in the resular army.
Without proceeding further with the
army bill the Senate at 4:65 p. m. went
into executive session and at 5:05 p. rn.
adjourned.
An Amendment to Enforce the Rules
WILL EXPEL HAZEES.
at West Point.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.-The Senate
Committee on Military Affairs to-day
adopted the following amendments to the
regular appropriation bill for the West
Point Military Academy: .
"Under, the direction of the Secretary of
War the superintendent of the United
States Military Academy shall make and
enforce such rules and regulations as
shall prevent the practice of hazing:, and
any cadet found guilty of participating in
such practice shall be expelled from the
academy and shall not be reappolnted to
the corps of cadets therein, nor to the
army of the United States."

Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, S. "vV..
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â Venezuela has
been given to understand that the United
States wllll exert its wbole power if neces
sary to provide protection to American in
terests within its territory. Representation
to this effect has been made by Minister
Loomis in accordance with Instructions
sent to him as a result of disquieting news
received yesterday indicating that an at
tempt would be made to dispossess the
New York and Bermudez companies of the
asphalt property without due process of
law.
It is believed in naval circles that the
gunboat Scorpion has left La Guayra and
is on her way to Guanoco, a port on the
San Juan branch of the Orinoco River,
about fifteen miles from the asphalt lakes,
which are in dispute. Lieutenant
Commander Nathan Sargent, command
ing, will, if necessary, land marines, but
he will avoid bloodshed if possible.' Upon
a call for reinforcements the Hartford will
be directed to return to Venezuelan Wa
ters. The Lancaster Is available, and the
battleships Kearsa&e and Massachusetts
are at Pensacola.
Venezuela is not menaced by the United
States only, however. Great Britain Is In
terested in the seizure' of two steamers
of the Orinoco Shipping and Trading
Company, which have British masters.
In addition the country is in a state of fer
ment brought about by the activity of the
followers of former President Andrade.
whom Castro, the present President, over
threw.
Minister' Loomls cabled the State De
partment to-day that dissatisfaction with
the Government also prevails among Its
soldiers. Mutiny occurred among troops
stationed in the barracks at Caracas, but
was suppressed on Monday. The magni
tude of the outbreak Is not known, but It
is apparent that the soldiers are not
wholly in sympathy with General Castro.
As his power depends upon the force un
der him, Venezuelans opposed to the Gov
ernment will probably take advantage of
the attitude of the United States and
Great Britain to bring about a revolution
With this revolution the United States is
not concen-3d, except in any effect it may
have upon American interests.
At this moment the anxiety of the au
thorities Is due to the hostile attitude
adopted by General Castro with respect to
the wishes of the American Government.
Minister Loomls-- has told him distinctly
that the United States is not taking- sides
with either the New York and Bermudez
Company or the Warner-Quainlan-Sull!
van Syndicate. The New York and Ber
mudez Company has a concession from
which It can be deprived only by due
process of law. General Castro has been
Informed that before dispossession can
occur there must be action by courts, and
action the United State<s will insist upon
If dispossession does occur before such
reparation. : â¢

Since some of the yellow journals continue to
scream out that Senator Hanna* has "threatened" ?Â«â¢
have the President callan extra session if the ship
ping bill be not passed, it is worth while to call at
tention to the fact that in a recent interview he stated
the story "is a lie." The language is hardly Senatorial,
but it suits the- case.
There is little wonder that we are popular with our
r.ewly reconciled English cousins. The London stock
market was threatened the other day with all sorts of
disaster and it was saved by the prompt assistance of
American gold.
It is announced that the proposed combination of
publishing houses in the East is not to bY a trust,
but only an alliance for the improvement of the trade
and the benefit of authors and readers. In that there
is^comfort.
It is strange that after providing so liberally for
harbor improvements Congress should hesitate aboilt
the shipping bill. Are we improving our harbors
solely for the benefit of, foreign ship-owners?
Congress attached to the apportionment bill a clause
providing that Congressional districts "shall be of
compact and contiguous territory, and as nearly as
practicable of equal number of inhabitants," but as
the arrangement of districts is a matter for State
legislators to deal with, the clause can hardly be
deemed anything more than an ornamental flourish.
Negotiations for the purchase of the Danish West
Indian islands seem to have reached an acute stage.
When last heard from our Government had asked
what Denmark would take for them, and the Danes
had replied by asking what we would give. At that
point the diplomatists recognized that the crisis had
come and paused for leflection.
The investigation of hazing at West Point has
brought out the fact that since the beginning of the
academic term, September I, there have been among
the cadets seven fights to a, finish with bare fists. In
comparison with that the prize-ring is a hollow
mockery.
The Senate has been so often charged with de
laying public business that attention should be called
to the promptness with which it passed the appor
tionment bill; but it is possible the Senators let it
pass solely because they deemed it none of their
business.
WATTERSON'S DITHYRAMB.
HENRY WATTERSON is not wiser than other
counselers of Democracy, and consequently has
no advice to give which in its substance is
worthy of note; but he has a breezy, picturesque,
dithyrambic style that lends a charm to all his earnest
utterances and renders men of all parties more or
less interested in what he says. Consequently it i3
worth noting that he has taken occasion of the recent
celebration of "Jackson's day" to pour forth the soul
of him in a song of passionate prose designed to rouse
Democracy and give it good cheer.
Mr. Watterson begins by analyzing the characteris
tics that distinguish Republicans from Democrats.
The Republican, he says, is a man who is convinced
the country is all right, and that he should get a share
of the good things that are going; while the Demo
crat, "with the weight of his country and his con
science upon him, lies awake at night and dream?,
or else grinds his teeth and swears."
Continuing his analysis the gifted Kentuckian goes
on: "Herein the Republican has much the better of
it. The Republican assumes that two and two are
four and goes on with his mathematics. The Demo
crat stops to discuss rhe problem, generally discover
ing, until it is too late, that two and two are five.
The Republican looks not in the bottom of his glass.
The Democrat will have sugar or he won't drink at
all. Be sure that Father Tom, he of the memorable
encounter with the Pope, who lost his whisky punch
while waiting for the water to boil so he might get
it hot, was a Democrat. If he had been a Republican
he' would have taken it cold and got away before
waking upl"
Having thus pointed out what to a Kentuckian
must seem the extreme of folly, the tendency to re
fuse whisky if it have no sugar in it, Watterson pro
ceeds to exhort Democrats to reform. He professe3
to be sanguine that Democracy's opportunity will
soon come and that along with it will come the needed
leader to profit by it Dropping at that point the

There Is great discontent among the

THE AGGRESSIVE SHEPHERD.
THE reports from the Livestock Convention at
Salt Lake City seem to show that the sheep
men are in the saddle and the cattle men are on
the run.
It is a curious illustration of the timidity of fixed
investments. Nearly every cattle man in the West,
whether a large or small herdsman, is a land-owner.
He has ranch lands and headquarters buildings and is
a taxpayer.
The dock-masters, on the other hand, are, rarely
land-owners. They have the daring and independence
of nomads. They drive their flocks at will where they
please, frequently in one year making from 500 t>
1000 miles, feeding and fattening their sheep as they
go, and leaving the range behind them bare and
dusty. Recently a flock-master in Wyoming, who
l:ad just sold out his flock of 140,000 sheep, boasted
that he had made a great fortune in sheep and yet had
never owned nor paid taxes on more than fifteen
acres of land! His pasture cost him nothing, for he
grazed on the public domain and paid the Govern
ment nothing for the feed that had made his great
fortune.
These aggressive shepherds have discovered that
they can drive the cattle off the range, for sheep will
feed where cattle have been, but cattle will not feed
where sheep have been. So when a sheep man
opposes leasing the range and talks highly about the
reed of a free range open to all he means a range
from which he has the power to exclude cattle,
monopolizing it for himself. These brave and enter
prising nomads go further than this, for they propose
at Salt Lake to demand a higher tariff and compel a
Federal inspection of manufactured goods, tagging
every bolt of fabric to show of what it is made. They
demand also that all forest reserves be thrown oper:
tc fheep. We really hope that they will not dcmand<nn
inspecting officer to overhaul us all on the street and
strip us to sec if we have woolen underclothing, with
the power to imprison us for failure to wear wool from
sheep that never cost a dollar for their feed.
While these virile nomads are asking for what they
v.-ant. and petting it. the timid cattle men are in dis
agreement among themselves, and while they quarrel
and higgle the sheep men are crowding them off the
range.
With free feed and a high wool tariff, and disappear
ance of range cattle, the profits of sheep-growing rise,
and so does the price of clothing and the price of
meat: The consumers of both are the people who
own the public domain. Perhaps they may soon de
mand that the shepherds pay them something for the
use and destruction of. their property.

Comment of thÂ© State Press on TVlen
and Matters at Sacramento.
IMPORTS OF RAW MATERIAL.
REPORTS from Washington announce that dur
ing the year 1900 there wa$ imported into this
country more raw material for use in manufac
turing than ever before in our history. The total value
of foreign products imported in a crude condition
during the year amounted to more than $275,000,000.
When to that sum is added the value of imported ar
ticles, "wholly or partially manufactured for use as
materials in manufacturing," the aggregate of manu
facturers' materials imported amounts to more than
$.160,000,000.
It is to be noted that the statement is based upon
eir.ven months' detailed figures already received by
the Treasury Bureau of Statistics, to which is added
an estimate for the twelfth month, December, based
upon the figures of the preceding month. This state
ment puts the importation of raw material in the
twelve months ending with December, 1900, at
$276,628,000, against $267,493,959 in 1899, $162,172,736
in 1896, and $160,523,454 in 1894.
A comparison of jRoq and 1900 with preceding:
years shows an increase of over 35 per cent in the
importation # of manufacturers' materials in these two
years as compared with the entire period from 1800
to 1898, and an increase of nearly 70 per cent as com
pared with the years 1894 and 1806. Even the remark
able fall in prices of manufacturers' materials which
has characterized the closing half of the year 1900 has
not prevented the total value of these materials im
ported in 1900 from exceeding that of 1809, though in
two articles, indiarubber and silk, the figures for 1900
show a reduction as compared with 1809.
The following table shows the value of the prin
cipal articles imported for use in manufacturing:
Chemicals $55,155,000
Hides and skins 50,652,000
Silks 32,757,000
Indiarubber 28,143,000
Fibers 25,528,000
Wool 19,030.000
Tin 18,680,000
Wood 15,622,000
Leaf tobacco 14,875.000
Cotton / 7,267,000
Furs and fur skins 6,148.000
Lead 3,793,000
The statistics show to what vast proportions our
manufacturing interests have grown. We have* be
come manufacturers of the raw material of other lands
as well as of our own. Yet we do not by any means
work up into "form for consumption all the raw ma
terial of our own production. This is one of the
paradoxes of industry. We ship our own raw products
abroad to be manufactured, and we import raw ma
terial to.be manufactured ourselves. It is that practice
that promotes commerce and goes far toward sus
taining the merchant fleets of the world.
r* ONGRESSMAN BROSIUS of Pennsylvania
( opposed the proposed increase in the number
of Representatives under the new apportion
ment bill on the ground that the House is already too
large for debate. He is reported in the Record as
saying: "Without some restriction upon the tendency
to increase, the House will continue to grow until
confusion worse confounded will bring the nation to
shame and invite the lingual curse of Babel to put an
end to the stupendous folly of attempting to legislate
in a mass-meeting."
He went on to say: "Few members of the House
can be heard with distinctness in all parts of the
chamber without an exertion of the vocal organs
which destroys every quality of the voice which
makes speaking or bearing agreeable and corrupts
every excellence in oratory. Much of what passes for
debate is only an exchange of vociferations across the
chamber."
As .the House passed the bill by an overwhelming
majority it is clear the arguments of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania had no influence upon their minds.
Possibly the arguments were not heard. The debate,
however, shows that there is something worse in the
House than vociferation. Bad as the shouting may
be, it is not quite so bad as the wit that is intended
to enliven the discussions. Here, for example, are
some of the exchanges of attack and repartee be
t-ween Mr. Littlefield of Maine and Mr. Hopkins of
Illinois:
Mr. Hopkins â One moment, pleasa. i' iV.'s
Mr. Littlefleld â This Is not a police court.
Mr. Hopkins â Well, then the gentleman is not at
home.
Mr. Llttlefleldâ You would be at home on the frontier
before a trial Justice in the purlieus of civilization con
ducting your method of discussion. .v.X
That much was merely preliminary. It served to
interest the House in the debate and brought about a
silence in the chamher, so that, all could hear what
followed. A little later this sally occurred:
. Mr. Hopkins â You say I made an assault on the
State of Maine. I deny It.
Mr. Llttlefleldâ I say that your speech from start to
finish was saturated with a pettifogging attack on the
State of Maine.
Mr. Hopkins â Well, now, I deny It. I am not as
familiar with pettifogging as the gentleman.
Mr. Littlefleldâ I trust the gentleman will continue to
stultify himself in the future.
Mr. Hopkinsâ Talk to me about stultifying myself!
I deny having done anything of the kind.
Mr. Littlefieldâ I will demonstrate that you did.
Mr. Hopkinsâ Oh, yes, you will do wonderful things.
Mr. Uttlefleldâ Is not the gentleman getting a little
touchy in that direction? '
Mr. Hopkinsâ I am not.
Mr. Littlefieldâ The gentleman can stand up or sit
down, just as he likes.
Mr. Hopkinsâ That is Just what I am going to do.
Mr. Llttlefleldâ That is just exactly what you are go
ing to do. ".' ' c.; 3
In that round it will be noted that while the spar
ring was clever on both sides no really effective blow
was landed. A little later, however, the knock
out was delivered in this manner:
Mr. HopkinsâIf there is any man who knows better
than another what can be done In that way (pettifog
ging) it is the gentleman from Maine.
Mr. Littlefieldâ The gentleman from Maine never yet
defended a criminal, but he has prosecuted several in
his time and he is after one now. '
It is to be borne in mind that Hopkins and Little
field are among the ablest and brightest leaders of the
House. Hopkins has been in the House a long time
and is one of its. most distinguished debaters, white
Littlefield, though a new man, is a native Maine bril
liant who managed to make himself dazzling in his
first session. Such * being the style of wit and
repartee that passes between Congressmen of their
rank, it is clear the House loses nothing when it
loses the ability to hear what is said. It is therefore
gratifying that Mr. Brosius' objections to an increase
in the number of the kepresentatives passed unheeded.
Less talk and more business is what the country
wishes of its Congressmen.

The "Interimistic" Baton.
The Kaiser has placed the venerablo
King Albert of Saxony on the same foot
ing -with Field Marshal Count "Waldersee
by presenting him with a so-called "in
terimistic" Field Marshal's baton. The
difference between this baton and the reg
ular baton Is that the latter is used only
on state occasions and parades, while the
"interimistic" baton Is carried also at the
maneuvers, ordinary reviews of the troops
and similar occasions. It is an inven
tion of the- Kaiser, whose fondness for
show knows no bounds, and was first
specially created for Count Waldersee In
order that the International troops In
China might always be forcibly reminded
of the German general's rank. Of course.
the Emperor has also granted such a, stick
to himself, which he carried ostentatious
ly at the last German army maneuvers In
Pomerania. â Plttsburg Dispatch.
whisky simile, for of course the colonel could not
dally long with merely metaphorical whisky, he in
vokes historic memories and urges Democrats to get
ready to greet the emergency and the man. In 'a
cheering voice he cries: "Old Hickory knew what to
do with the cotton bags, let us know what to do with
such defenses as we have; and so, above the roar of
the huzzas of the Republicans, may we hear the distant
drumbeats â mayhap -the gunsâ -of the old Jacksonian
hunting shirts, marching to give successful battle to
the redcoats of Prerogative and Power to vindicate
the divinity of Populr.r Sovereignty."
Having thus prepared the way for his climax he
sweeps up to it with the rush of a wild goose alon^
a gale of wind. There is something of exultation in
his honk, and he hurls defiance at all the babblers
who* are advising the party how to reorganize and
reform. To his party he shouts: "Never mind the
impudent twaddle of played-out politicians about 'rc
oiganization.' Never mind the self-admiring com
plaisance of would-be leaders and sham reformers.
These are the merest froth,- the veriest fustian, mean
ing little and counting for nothing. The leaders who
are to regenerate Democracy have yet to come upon
the scene, and before they are arrived the old, obso
lete setâ to whom we owe our undoingâ will have
passed away. For. the present it is enough to say
dose ranks and forward march! Down with Mounte
bankisml Down with Pharisaism 1 And, with a hip
hooray from the boys in the trenches, up with the
standards of Jeffeson and Lincoln, Old Hickory's
battle-flag flying at the fore!"
There may notbe much of historic justification in
that easy conjunction of Jefferson, Jackson and Lin
coln, but the fact that Bryan's name was not added
to the list is an evidence, the orator did not lose hi3
head nor his sense of the eternal fitness of things. His
screed, therefore, may be accepted as an interesting
contribution to the Democratic literature of- the day.
It is an evidence that there remains yet among us at
least one eloquent exponent of the old Democracy
that never made the mistake of stopping to consider
whether there was sugar in the glass.
THE report of the Director of the Mint shows
that the money of the world has increased ioc
per cent in twenty-seven years, far outrunning
the increase in the world's population.
The world's total stock of money in 1873 was
$4,600,000,000, while in 1900 it was $11,600,000,000. The
great increase has been in gold, amounting to $3,600,
000,000. There is now less uncovered paper currency
than in 1873, implying a sounder financial condition,
because the coin reserve is able to float the paper
easier than then.
These monetary statistics are a complete refutation
of the whole silver aigument. It was persistently
urged by the free silver advocates that "the crime of
1873" consisted in destroying halt the money of the
world in order to increase the value and the purchas
ing power of the remaining half. It was argued that
this was for the purpose of gathering all the property
of the world into the hands of the "money trust."
Yet steadily from 1873 to 1001 the money stock of
the world has increased. Instead of losing 50 per cent
it has gained 100 per cent in twenty-seven years. Nor
is it true that at any time in that period the volume
of money, or its quality, has declined. The quality
of the whole volume of money is determined by the
amount of uncovered paper mixed with it. That
means paper not redeemable in coin. There is now a
less percentage of such paper to the whole volume
than in 1873. So the financial condition of the world
has continually improved while the free silver advo
cates have been' insisting that it was growing worse.
More than that. The years of most rapid improve
ment have been those in which Mr. Bryan has been
striving to put this country on a silver basis. The
accelerated rate of improvement began seven years
ago, or three years before he introduced his cross of
gold and crowp of thorns' into politics. The im
provement began, it will be observed, in 1893, or with
the repeal of the silver purchasing clause of the Sher
man act.
If the present rate of increase go on, far more rap
idly than" that of the population, the world will be
more likely to have too much than too little money.

the owner would pay a big premium could

Jersey Island is under water. The recent
rains have swollen the river and the em
bankments could not ptand the pressure.
Jersey Landing is threatened and In con

to build new levees.
Three other dredger3 for the Sacramen
to and San Joaquin are now nearlrsr com

The bark Mauna Ala, barkentlno Olym

eighteen days from Honolulu and there Id
considerable wagering on the front as to
which vessel will be here first. On thÂ«
15th Inst. a steamer came m and reported
that a four-masted schooner resembling
the Rosamond was outside. The butchers
and greengrocers at once rushed fresh
supplies out to the vessel. She turned out
to fie the Lottie Bennett, however, and
now much of the stuff is going to waste
in Peterson's boathouse. The poneral
trend of the betting goes to show that tho
Olympic will win. There would be a gen

na Ala show up In the lead.

Jt steatoer Eva arrived at Astoria on
the 16th inst. and reported passing:
a derelict on January 13. At that time thj
Eva was off Grays Harbor and bore down
on the abandoned vessel. The latter'.*
name could not be made out, but Captain
Pederson said she was painted white and
about 150 tons burden. Her masts had
gone by the board and the decks wer-?
awash. A heavy storm was raging anil
the Eva had to stand "on and off" for
four days before attempting to cross the
Columbia River bar.
On the 15th Inst. the steamer Fulton
arrived at Grays Harbor ajid reported
the schooner Swan ashore on the north
entrance of the harbor. Everything aoov<j
deck was gone and the vessel was water
logged. According to the report of tho
captain of the Flilton thÂ« Swan was on
her way from Santa Barbara to PugrK

a record of any such vessel. There is a
little seven-ton sloop called the Swan,
but she could not be the vessel in ques

The wires are down between here and
Grays Harbor and Coauille River and in
consequence many of the local owners of
coasters are on the. anxious seat to know
what vessel It Is that has been lost 'with

A dispatch to The Call from Santa Bar

associations, the African lands upon the
Mediterranean turn their back upon tha
great division of which they are geograph
ically a part. Egypt, Tunis, Algiers, under
whatever name have always been closely
identified with Europe. So axe they now.
The European rivers are arteries of
communication and commerce. They pro
vide the earliest and the most constant
roads for the traveler and the tradesman.
The African rivers, on the other hand, ara
seldom navigable near their mouth.s.
Though thousands of miles in length ani
of prodigious volume they can rarely be
ascended by a vessel from tho ocean. Tha
suddenness of their descent as, pourlns
down the plateau, they rush to the ocean,
gives rise to innumerable rapids and cat
aracts and falls. Sandbars often, obstruct
approach to their mouths. Moreover far
ther Inland they are sometimea clogged
and rendered well nigh impassable by tha
luxuriant vegetation of the tropics. Lofty
peaks rise here and there ugon the pla
teau, but seldom as parts of one continu
ous chain. Except :hn Atlas Mountains
there are few ranges to constitute tha
boundaries of well defined and compre
hensive watersheds, so tew of the rivers
pursue their course In one fixed direction.
Only after swinging around In enormoui
circles and after having Sowed north,
east, south and west, dc the Congo ana
the Niger find their way to the shor*.
Also Innumerable rivers In tha Interior
never approach the coast, but bury them
selves in immense lakes formed in tha
depressions of the greai plateau.
The fact that It was mainly situated In
the torrid zone was a further and perhaps
the most effective obstacle to tha develop
ment of Africa. Hypothetical achieve
ments have been a^crlbtd to people wh.>

There is not time to tell of the intrepli
men and womenâ for some of the most
dauntless explorers were women â who
since the birth of persons now alive have
more than doubled mankind's knowledge
of Africa. Less than fifty years ago
every map of the unknown continent re
sembled a gigantic figure 8, the northern
loop comprising a larger circle than the
southern. Each loop consisted of a fringe
of land, averaging hardly more than a
hundred miles in width, bounded on its
outer edge by the ocean and shading off
indefinitely toward the interior. The junc
tion of the loops was an ill-defined ban-1
reaching from the Atlantic to the Indian
Ocean. The various territories or states
along this band were vaguely Indicated,
but the space inside each loop was hardly
more than an enormous blank dotted at
Intermediate points with a few uncertain
The revelation of Africa during the last
half-century was the work of David Liv
ingstone more than of any other man. al
most more than of all other men. From
1849 to 1S73, with exhaustless energy and
courage, he traveled in every direction
through its trackless Interior. He was the
first European to cross the continent. He
now elenps in Westminster Abbey. No
man better deserves a final resting place
in that mausqleum of statesmen and ben
efactors of humanity.
Yet notwithstanding all that Living
stone and his predecessors and followers
have accomplished: notwithstanding that
burning human passion impels to discov
ery and exploration; notwithstanding the
gonius of missionary ardor and commer
cial enterprise which no obstacle can dis
courage. Africa is still the dark conti
nent. However large our knowledge of It
to-dav may seem In comparison with the
little "men knew of it in the past, the sum
total of present information is small and
much of It uncertain compared with what
we know of the other great divisions of
the globe.
Bartolomeu Diaz discovered the Cape of
Good Hope in 14S6. Columbus landed at
Watlings Island In 1491 Hence by a strik
ing coincidence Africa was rounded and
the eastern verpe of America laid bare at
almost the same time. Yet In the four
centuries since tho relative development
of the two continents presents a remark
able contrast. Already in Us civilization
America has rivaled Europe. In some of
their achievements Its inhabitants of
European origin have surpassed the an
cient countries from which their ancestors
came. On the other hand, Africa In point
of fact has 'remained stationary. The
colonial settlements planted at rare Inter
vals along the shore and the parceling out
of its territory among the western states
have made scant impression on the great
mass of the continent. Till a very recent
date its chief activity has been the pro
duction of slaves and its chief industry
the elave trade. The raw materials which
now filter to the coast for exportation are
the same as when Carthage, before the

THE SAX, FRAXGISCO CALL, FRIDAY. JANUARY 18, 1901;
All Hands Supposed to Have Been Lost, and .as There Is
Some Doubt About Vessel s Identity Much Anxiety
Exists in Shipping Circles. â¢
SCHOONER IS REPORTED WRECKED
ON THE HEADS AT GRAYS HARBOR
(Introductory Paper.)
For generations Africa ha3 been called
the dark continent. This at the flcat
glance seems a strange name to apply
to that one of the six divisions of tha
world which is mainly situated In thÂ»
torrid zone and which Is more enveloped
In continuous and blazing sunshine than
any other. Xo part of Xorth America
or Europe or continental Asia extends fir
enough southward to reach the equator.
South America is of the continents the
one in physical character least dissimi
lar to Africa, yet more than one-third
of South American territory Is situated
in the temperate zone. So also are twe
thlrds of the island continent Australia.
But all Africa, except its blunt southern
extremity, the northern part of its great
Sahara and the countries Immediately
adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, is In
cluded between the tropics of Cancer and
Capricorn; There the rays of sunlight are ;
most direct, the days longest and tha
nights shortest. As far as geographic sit
uation is concerned, the shining continent
or the luminous continent would appear
a more appropriate name. ' \
The term "dark" was applied to Africa
In consequence of the supposed mental
and moral Inferiority of Its inhabitants.
Also it was a portion of the world with
which Europeans were little acquainted,
and the adjective indicated not so much
its condition as the opaque ignorance of
foreigners concerning it.
Even after the daring expeditions un
dertaken by the Portuguese, Prince Hen
ry the Navigator, it was, except a nar
row belt along the shore, shrouded in a
thick veil of obscurity. If not unknowa
ble, it continued at least unknown. The
rest of the globe was becoming familiar,
but Africa remained tha region of mys
tery and perhaps of marvels. In the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ad
venturous explorers sought the fountains
of the Nile just aa In the fifteenth cen
tury they had risked their lives in quest
of the kingdom of Prester John. The
learned world, credulous of the fabulou?,
was Inclined to distrust any simple and
unvarnished tale of travels. A man was
credited according as the glowing account
of his wanderinps and experiences taxed
imagination. The Scotchman James
Bruce was the foremost African explorer
of his time. For twelve years he lived
in Africa and pushed farther up the Nile
than any European had ever been. But
the plain, unadorned account of what he
had seen and done was received with al
most universal disbelief. Another travel
er, as daring and perhaps better known,
was Mungo Park. He followed the river
Niger through a large part of Its course
and was finally killed by the natives near
Timbuctoo.- The Nile and the Niger were
on the lips of all geographers. Tet the
The character of the coastline no lesa
than Its meager proportions Is another
disadvantage. Throughout Its center and
south the continent is cne vast plateau,
surprisingly destitute of mountain ranges.
In general the land rises abruptly from
the vicinity of the sea or even from ltÂ»
very borders. Lowlands of any consider
able extent lying between the ocean and
this Interior plateau are seldom seen. So
the shore, as beheld from the water. Is no
less repellent and Inhospitable In appear
ance than It Is In fact. An exception may
be noted in that extended northern trart
which stretches along tha Mediterranean
Sea westward toward Morocco. But south
of that tract Interposes the terrible Great
Sahara to cut It off from the life and des
tiny of Interior Africa. In fact, in th*ir
present relations, as In all their historical
This is the very opposite of what we
observe on the map of Europe. There the
contour is Jagged, broken and most irreg
ular. Bays and gulfs mingle in confusion
with peninsulas, and all the waters are
dotted with hundreds of Islands of various
size. All other things being equal, the
greater the amount of coast line in pro
portion to the Included area the greater
that area's accessibility and probability
of development. Europe possesses one
mile of coast to ever}' 1ST square miles of
territory. Africa possesses but one mile
of coast to every 737 square miles of ter
ritory. Thus nature has been In this re
gard four times more generous to Europe
than to Africa.
Some of these obstacles will be rendered
evident by a glance at the map. First to
be noted is the regular and monotonous
contour of the coast line. Sharp, deep
bays and prolonged gulfs nowhere pro
ject into the land. Peninsulas nowhere
thrust themselves into the sea. Conse
quently there la corresponding absence of
natural harbors and ports of entry. ' The
Islands near the coast are exceedingly
few and small. Only toward the north
west are there groups like the Canaries,
the Madeiras and the Cape Verdes, and
they are distant from one another and
from the shore. The one large African
island â Madagascarâ Is separated from the
mainland by a channel broader than the
Red Sea. no less than 290 miles In width.
birth of Christ, was the emporltrm of thÂ»
Southern Mediterranean.
For tbe Isolation of Africa, from thÂ» rest
of the world, for Its practical inaccessi
bility and for tbe stagnant condition of
African Ufa the physical formation and
the geographic situation of the continent
are responsible. The3Â© factors have pre
sented Invincible obstacles to Its progress
and development in the past. Centuries
hence, when other rejrtons become over
crowded with population and 'when man
better understands how to grapple with
and subdue the forces of nature, these ob
stacles will be reduced to a minimum.
They will be diminished, if not overcome.
But at present, and for a period In the
future so long as to baffle calculation,
they constitute almost insuperable bar
riers to advance-

THERE was no complaint at the
doings or actions of the favorites
at Oakland track yesterday. The
track was c*uppy, notwithstanding
which five of the six first choices
finished In front. No particular Jockey
shone to any advantage, although "Monk"
Coburn did conclude the exercises by cap
turing the last two races on the card. It
is perhaps useless to add that the attend
ance was large and that Mr. Caldwell was
in fairly good form with the flag. The
veteran starter has not been seen at his
best during the present meeting. If he
would pay a little more attention to the
favorites while at the post there would
be less comment. Of course first choice's
are not entitled to a "shade"; just an even
break, that's all.
It most assuredly looked, at the weights,
as If Free Lance should carry the most
support of the seven starters In the open
ing seven furlong run, and Harry Stover's
horse closed a 3 to 2 favorite. The big
fellow had Mounce up, and after leading
the latt half won easily from Grand
Sachem, the second choice. Mike Rice ran
third. -
Although Gold Lace was highly touted
to win the five and a half furlong scram
ble following, the smart money went in
on The Light. The Montana bred filly.
i owned by Hughes & Elliott, was backed
from 7 to 5 down to 7 to 10, and won, rid
den out by Dominlck. Fighting it out for
the place, Ting-a-Llng. a 40 to.l chance,
got the decision over âobyleix L, a 200 to
1 shot, by a nose. Gold Lace swerved per
ceptibly the last sixteenth, finishing in
fourth place.
Burns & AVaterhouse took the two-year
old dash with the speedy Dorene. The
Torso nlly was backed to 1 to 2 favoritism,
andtgetting away in advance of her field
was. never headed. Driving hard,
Larghetta snatched the place from Lou
welsea by a neck.
Close on this came the victory of Oppo
nent, first choice for the mile and a six
teenth selling affair. O'Connor had the
leg up on the consistent little chestnut
horse, and lt took .desperate urging to
overtake and down Sir Holla a length. The
winner always had first call in the bet
ting, finally going Into the starter's hands
a 7 to 10 favorite. Wax made a bluff of
lt for a quarter, then retired to his cor
ner. He has bad legs and carried no
stable money.
While Rollick was the selected and pre
ferred one for the fifth recital, lt was
plainly apparent that Maggie Davis was
not to be despised. Coburnwas carded to
ride the""mare.' and he haÂ« her in front
almost from the jump. Rollick and Bab
had it nip and tuck for the place, but
Maggie reached the stand first by five
lengths. J. Miller on Bab did not get
away from the post well, neither did he
use the best judgment, all of which mili
tated against the filly's chances.
"Doc" street's fast mare, Sweet Cap
oral, carried the sharp support In the
closing six furlong spin. Backed to 13 to
5 favoritism, she led from start to finish.
Domlnick on Nullah disposed of Handl
capper for the place.

Braunhart â They would not pay any at
tention to it. With due respect to the
board. I rpcak authoritatively as to that.
The members are too busy to pay any at
tention to a request of that kind. They
Â¦would simply glance at it and throw it
into the waste basket. The best plan
would be to send a communication to tho
Er p aker of the House and th#Â» President
of the Senate, if you are going to take
any action at all. The mere mailing of
your, resolution will only be time lost
Tcblnâ We want to do the right thing.
Reedâ Why would not this be the way
out of It. Inasmuch as we have prohib
ited poolselllng of all kinds, we don't care
to cake aay recommendations in the mat-
Tobin â I would like to see bill shut
up the poolrooms in Sausalito. We might
sond a recommendation to the Legislature
cv. the subject.
Tobinâ I would be glad to see It become
a law if lt would prevent the selling of
pools on boxing contests, cycling events
or other athletic events, inside or outside
a building.
Staffordâ I guess the easiest way out o?
it !s to put lt on fila.
Tobinâ I don't like to report It. Let the
beard place lt on file.
Staffordâ We might report in favor of
its indefinite postponement.
Braunhartâ This is an exact copy of a
bill Introduced by Atherton at the last
session to prevent poolselllng In Sausalito.
It passed the Assembly, but was defeated
In the Senate.
Tobinâ We ought not only to report
against this bill, but to report a bill cut
ting down the racing season. They ought
to cut down their racing season to ninety
days.
Reedâ Why, this bill restrict* no one
else, bo far as I can see, but us.
Reedâ If you think that this act would
authorize the selling of pools in this city,
I would recommend that lt be placed on
file.
Staffordâ Yes, that's my opinion. They
will adopt all these subterfuges to get
around it. r . -
Tobinâ I don't think this bill cuts any
difference In the world with the Ingleside
track.
Staffordâ I would prefer that the bill be
not passed. They will hold these boxing
contests In the center of town and they
will sell all kinds of pools.
After disposing of a number of minor
matters Secretary Russell read a type
written draft of the Kelshaw bill. Super
visor Reed then handed Supervisor Staf
ford a printed copy of the act and stated
that he was in Sacramento last Monday
and Senator Belshaw asked him to pre
sent it to him. At the request of Chair
man Tobin Stafford read it aloud. At
the conclusion of the reading the follow
ing discussion took ylace:
Reedâ Senator Belshaw asked me to say
this to you, Mr. Stafford: That this bill
eimply prohibited the Felling of pools out-
Side of racetracks and did not limit the
racing season.
Staffordâ If the ordinance prohibited
them from selling pools outside a race
trajck, would it prohibit them from sell-
Ing pools Inside of Ingleside track?
Tcblnâ It would seem to me that this is
polng to open the door for all these
things. The very moment you have pool
telling In this city on boxing matches you
destroy the effect of the ordinance. It is
the same in San Jose, Los Angeles, Sacra
mento and Sausalito. Los Angeles is a
hot bed for poolselllng, Just as Sausalito
Is, and I sympathize with the people of
Bausallto, who want to get rid of it. The
only objection I see to the bill Is that lt
would allow poolselllng on boxing exhi
bitions In the building. I think we had
better pass it by and make no recom
mendation at all.
The committee feared to take favorable
action, believing if they did they would
Â¦weaken the ordinance passed by them
some months ago, which stopped pool sell
ing within the city and county of San
Francisco. Upon mot'oa made by Super
visor Reed it was recommended that ac
tion on the bill be indefinitely postpone!
upon the ground that this city had pro
hibited pool selling and the law advocated
by Senator Belshaw could not affect San
Francisco, but would affect counties over
which the -^Supervisors of San Francisco
had no jurisdiction.
The merits of the measure were dis
cussed at length by the committee, which
is composed of Supervisors Tobin. Reed
end Stafford, and Suoervisor Braunhart
end Mayor Phelan, who were present,
added their opinions.
At a meeting of the Police Committee of
the Board of Eupervi&ors held yesterday
afternoon it was unanimously decided not
to indorse the bill introduced in the Sen
ate by Bel*haw of Centra Costa and
Marin which has for its object the re
stricting of pool selling to the places
where contests are held.
Tobinâ Let us recommend such an act if
you think it will do any good.
Braunhartâ 1 don't think you can pass
such a bill.
Staffordâ We are simply called upon to
recommend the passage of the Belshaw
act and not to ask about the curtailing of
the racing season.
Tobinâ I think the racing in this vicin
ity should be cut in half. What shall we
doâ refer this matter to the City Attor
ney?
Reedâ There is a motion to postpone lt.
I don't think that our action will have
any effect upon the Legislature.
Tobinâ We can get an opinion from the
City Attorney by Saturday.
Reedâ We might as well get rid of it.
buppose his opinion eays that it does not
affect our legislation at all?
Tobin Then I would vote in favor
of it.
Stafford â I would vote against it.
Tobinâ I would like to see the poolrooms
shut up in Sausalito.
Staffordâ I would like to see them shut
up in San Francisco. Kever mind Saula
lito. We have our owiÂ« troubles.
Reedâ It does not affect us. I move that
we recommend that action be indefinitely
postponed upon the ground that San
Francisco has prohibited all poolselllng,
and the law could not affect this city,
but would affect counties over which we
have no jurisdiction.
Tobinâ It Is so ordered. '
Braunhart â It is an open secret that
Senator Leavitt and one or two others are
openly combined against the passage of
this bill. This bill will not alone be op
posed by the poolsellers, but the people
of the Oakland racetrack.
Staffordâ This law affects San Francisco
more than any other city in the State.
We have boxing contests, bicycle races
and all kinds .of contests of skill.
Tobinâ But it does not apply. This does
not interfere with our ordinance. It simp
ly says that it will be illegal to make
wagf-rs In certain places.
Staffordâ You mav be able to sell pools
at a boxing contest.
Tobinâ This general ordinance would not
interfere with our ordinance. To my mind
they don't clash at all.
Staffordâ I think we ought to dispose of
it without any recommendation .at all.
Reedâ Do you mean to let It go before
the board?
Tobinâ I think it is a rood bill and it
will not hurt us at all. It will close up
the poolrooms at Los Angeles, Sacra
mento, Sausallto and other bucket-shops.
It is a good bill eo long as it does not
hurt us.
Braunhartâ The Oakland people are
fighting it, I am told, because if it were
passed it would reopen Ingleside. Tho
proper thing to do ia to close poolrooms
in cities.
Mayor Phelanâ Are there any poolrooms
open?
Braunhartâ Yes; they are conducted
clandestinely.
Staffordâ There are no poolrooms here.
You make handbooks. They don't give
you a ticket.
Mayor Phelanâ In New Tork they pro
hibit pool selling on the track and off the
track, don't they7
Braunhartâ The Horton law prohibits
pool selling on the track.
Tobin â They have thousands of people
at the race track as we have them here.
They give you a ticket and you cash
your ticket. This was done immediately
after the passage of the Horton law.
They will pay for the privilege of selling
poools as If lt were an open book. The
law does not restrict them at all.
Staffordâ It seems to me that we would
take the safe side by simply refusing In
dorsement.
Braunhartâ The people of Sausalito are
greatly interested in tnis: and Belshaw Is
a very earnest gentleman. The- bill is
uncertain, though.
Braunhartâ They ought to limit racing.
That is the only way to Bolve the prob
lem.
Tobin â How can people go to Sacra
mento and have a law passed In the face
of tho control Burns has up there?
Mayor Phelanâ The Legislature some
times will do a good act. if asked to.
Braunhartâ I think the Senate Is a very
good body.
Tobinâ It certainly would, be a good
thing if they limited racing in this town
to thirty days.
Braunhartâ The railroad Is greatly in
terested In the racing game. The people
who frequent the track across the bay
rido to and from the ferry and crowd the
boats dally. You won't find any man who
Is considered a railroad member vote for
anv bill restricting racing.
Tobin â If there I? any doubt I will vote
for the bill if it will shut up poolrooms,
but I am opposed to lt if there is any in
tpntion to open Ingleslde and allow pool
selling on Market street and all over town.
Braunhart â Would we permit open pool
rooms In this town?
Tobinâ That Is Just the question. They
are afraid that if they open Inglcsfde the
Legislature mlsrht pass a law allowing
thirty days' racing In any county. It
would give Tanforan and Injrleslde thirty
days each and Oakland would only get
thirty days. I sympathize with the peo
ple of Sawsallto; who are trying to close
the poolrooms there. I move that the
recommendation be Indefinitely postponed,
upon the jrround that we have no assur
ance that this bill will not be used to open
poolrooms in San Francisco.
Braunhartâ Are you not. In. favor of a
limitation of the racing season?
Tobin â To shut up poolrooms at Sau
salito and all over the State where con
tests of skill are going on. It does not
take away the vitality of our ordinance,
which prevents the selling- of pools inside
or outside a racetrack or inclosure.
ter. and I move that it be indefinitely
postponed.
Tobinâ The Merchants' Association has
indorsed it.
Braunhartâ They had a representative
in Sacramento last session. Mr. Dickin
son had it at the bottom of the file and
1 placed It on the emergency lile, and he
opposed his own bill. I understand the
chief opponents -of this bill are the peo
ple interested In the Oakland track. It is
a case of "dog eat dog."
Mayor Phelanâ Or of horse eat horse.
What is the history of the bill?
They Decide Not to Indorse the Measure Upon the Ground
That It Might Defeat a Municipal Ordinance.

HOTEL DEL CORONADO, Jan. 17.â
The Pacific Coast field trials came to a
successful conclusion to-day and the last
stake was finished in time to allow the
owners and spectators to reach the hotel
at 5 o'clock p. m. The all age Btake was
decided this morning after three braces
of doss had been run. The winners In the
first and second were the same as in the'
derby, excepting that their positions were
reversed. Peach Blossom taking the first
and Lady the second position. Many ex
perts are of the opinion that after the
race put up by these puppies Jhis morn
ing, added to the excellent work done
in the derby, they are two as high class
puppies as can be found east or west.
Judge Johnson gives lt as his opinion that
their work has not been beaten In any
derby during the last year. The running
was as follows:
Lady-Peach Blossomâ The first point In
the heat was secured by Lady, but her
work was not equal to that of yesterday,
while Blossom's was considerably better.
She was more decisive In her point, work
and moved In better style than Lady
throughout the race. Blossom got the
next point and followed It with another.
Lady pinned the next single and was fol
lowed almost immediately by Blossom
with another point in full view of the
spectators. Lady honored this point and
the picture drew applause from the crowd.
Just as they were called up Blossom made
another point and â¢ Lady a back, but this
was probably not recognized by the
judges.
Cuba of Kenwood-Verona Cashâ This
heat was devoid of much Interest and the
only good piece of work was a bevy point
by Cash in the open field. Cuba seemed
off color and showed no form whatever.
Cuba Zeep-Merry Heartâ This was the
last heat and resulted in two points lor
Merry Heart and one for Zeep after he
had done an excellent piece of roading.
The judges' decision was W. \V. Van
Arsdale's Peach Blossom first. J. E. Ter
ry's Lady second; Stockdale Kennels'
Cuba Zeep and Albert Betz's Merry Heart
divided third. .
Members' stakeâ This stake is one in
which any member of the club may enter
his own- dog, but*he Is required to handle
him during the running. The decision of
the judges seemed extremely unpopular,
as it was the opinion of those present
that a serious error was made in not
placing Tod Sloan's VI nrat Instead of
giving it to Maggie F. VI was down three
times and ran without an error. She was
steady to wing and shot and showed ex
quisite nose. Maggie F In all her heats
was uncertain and unsteady; she broke in
on flush and shot and on several points no
birds were found. The running of -Merry
Heart was handled by Albert Betz. VI
was handled by Tod Sloan. Merry Heart
secured the first point after a short run,
then Vi pointed directly in front of the
teams and was steady to flush. A few
feet away Bhe drew to another point and
this time Sloan killed the bird, which Vi
retrieved nicely. *
Val's Mark, handled by Henry Keller;
Maggie F, handled by P. D. Linville-
Val's Mark soon showed that he was not
under control and at one time disappeared
and his owner was compelled to mount a
horse in order to find him, which he did
after a few minutes. Maggie made one
point where a bird was founc 1 , but two or
three where none could be raised.
Senator'.s Trinket, handled by J. "W.
Flynn; Petronella, handled by W. S.
Tevis â Neither dog was accustomed to his
handler and no points were made during
the heat. This ended the first series.
Second seriesâ Vl-Maggle Fâ In this
heat one point was recorded for each dog,
but outside of this there was nothing
done, as birds were scarce.
Petronella-Merry Heartâ The only point
made in this heat was made by Merry
Heart, while Petronella showed no dispo
sition to point even (.hough birds were
plentiful. In spite of the fact that three
dogs in this stake had points and backs
to their credit and â¢ that Petronella had
none she was again ordered down with
Vi. Sloan's dog did a nice piece of work
in this heat, pointing a running bird,
roading it for some distance and then
pointing stanchly and remaining steady
Â¦when the bird was 'flushed.
The judges' decision was: P. D. Lin
ville's Maggie F first, Tod Sloan's Vi sec
ond. Albert Betz's Merrv Heart third.
Champion stake â This stake was run
with only two dogsâ Stockdale Kennels'
Cuba of .Kenwood and W. W. Van Ars
dale's Peach Mark. Neither dog seemed
in first-class condition and this was es
pecially true of Peach Mark; which, after
the first few minutes, ran listlessly until
the end. This stake is run., in two-hour
heats and tells heavily on 'any dog not
in perfect condition. No rest is allowed
except for the actual time necessary to
water the dogs. During the first hour's
running Cuba showed little form, but
from that time on began to improve and
seemed to grow better until the end- of
the race. His style and speed were bet
ter and his points more snappy. Peach
Mark secured tho ereater number of
points, but her lack of speed was against
her. Her slowness was a matter of sur
prise to the spectators, as in all of her
previous trials she nad shown fine form,
and lt was plain to all that she was not
herself in to-day's race.
The Judges' decision was: First. Stock
dale Kennels' Cuba of Kenwood.
This finished the eighteenth annual
trials of the club. It was decided at last
night's executive meeting to hold the next
trials at Coronado providing that Man
ager E. S. Babcock cuts down all tha
heavy brush that has Interfered with the
running of this year and otherwise places
the grounds In perfect condition. This
he has agreed to do. An abundance of
birds has been found and the many con
veniences regarding hotel accommoda
tions, livery and the proximity of thÂ©
grounds have greatly pleased the mem
bers.

to overflowing there still remained fully
500 men, women and children in the lobby.
The doors leading to the tanks were
closed against them and they could not
gel out of the building, as several thou
sand people were clamoring at the street
doors to gain entrance. a. telephone
message was sent to the City Hall
for additional police assistance. A squad
of policemen arrived a quarter of an hour
later and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that they succeeded in clearing
a passageway bo that the front doors
could be opened to permit of the people

PLETED THEIR TRAINING FOR THE FIGHT WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE THIS EVENING AT

8Piper Case Transferred.
A -telegraphic story , to the effect that
the controversy over the $65,000 estate of
the late Leroy Piper would be transferred
from Santa Clara/ County to this city was
verified yesterday by the tiling of a pe{i
tlon for letters of administration upon de
cedent's estate by Charles A. Sheets. The
matter has been assigned lo Judge Troutt
for hearing.
Present appearances point to a hard
fought .battle being waged among the
heirs of the late J. P. Harrington, a min
ing man, who die'd recently at the Russ
House.
The deceased left an estate valued at
$15,000. At the time of his death it waa
supposed that he. had not left a. will, but
later it was found that one was deposited
with the Union Trust Company, and this
document hassince'beennled."
In this wHl Harrington bequeathed to
Mollie Harrington, his daughter, living in
Michigan, the sum of $10. He left the bal
ance of his estate, which is mostly repre
sented by cash, to his sisters and their
nephews and nieces, who also reside in
Michigan.
Mollie Harrington, the daughter, thinks
that a great injustice has been done her.
She has written a long letter to Attorney
M. C. Hassett, in which she states that
she will arrive in this city in a few days
and contest the will of her deceased
father.
Miss Harrington cannot explain the es
trangement that existed between herself
and . her parent, but she says that for
many years he acted very indifferently
toward her and in no way contributed to
her support.
Harrington's acknowledgment In his will
of his daughter was a surprise to his
many friends, few of whom were aware
that he had ever been married.

SEATTLE. Jan. 17.â Four rich Klondik- '
ers are missing under circumstances most :
mysterious In each case. . Detective? hired
for' special- investigations, the , well or
ganized mounted police of the Northwest
Territory, and the Seattle police force as
well, have joined hands in a determined

significant, however, that two -of the'.lost
have been traced to Seattle and. there Is :
an impression In Daws^n that the third
one may have reached here. :, . \
J. S. l^ancaster, merchant, was last seen
at the Butler Hotel in Seattle, August 23.

,for him to drop out of sight. Murray <

ond avenue in Seattle about July 4, 190ft.
lie had about $3000 in gold and bills: Dr.
Joseph Bettlnger, druggist, 'was last' seen
December 17 near Lake Ler Barge, Alaska.
Mixed with the murder theory in this caiÂ»e
is a rumor of a love affair with a sister
in a Uawson hospital, the trail leading ap
parently to Seattle.
aiilo Kelly, a' well-known resident of
Juneau, was last heard of October 8, 11)00.
at . White. Horse, Alaska. He had a
large -sum of money in his possession.
' Several theories have been advanced to
account for the sudden disappearance of
tbese four men. The first is that there
exists along the Upper Yukon a desperate
gang. of robbers and murderers, who keep
track of men with money through
"steerers." Some think that there la
alao a Seattle end, explained by the fact
that rich Klondikers who have passed
safely up the river apparently never get
beyond Seattle. Â¦; â¢ Â£*
The efforts to get trace of Lancaster
include an offer of 1500 reward. Circulars
containing an accurate description of the
man have been sent broadcast through
out the country. There seems to be a set
tled conviction that he was murdered. If
such 13 the case the mystery centers In
Seattle. He was 50 years old, 6 feet 3
inches tall, and in addition to black hair,
mixed with gray, wore a full black beard.
He was a member of the Maccabees, the
Ancient Order of United Workmen and
the Roman Catholic church.
Dr. Bettlnger left Dawson November 6.
His wife started up the river after him a
short time later. She has never seen him
since he left Dawson. Sam Fretwell says
he saw the doctor near Lake Le Barge
December 17. The mounted police have
not traced him farther than Ogllvie.
forty-eight miles from Dawson.
A dispatch from Dawson says that there
is a rumor there to the effect that the doc
tor became interested in one of the sisters
In, a Dawson hospital. â¢ She was trans
ferred, the rumor has it. whereupon she
went to Seattle and entered a hotel as a
chambermaid. Nothing has beÂ»n dis
covered in Seattle to confirm or deny the
rumor.
Murray McDonald left Dawson in June to
visit his mother in Nova Scotia. He had a
large amount of gold and bills, which he
was fond of displaying. At first it was
thought he had been put out of the way at
White Horse, but since then he has been
reported as having been in Seattle about
July 4. Â¦ ' - Â¦:
Kelly left White Horse for Dawson Oc
tober 8. intending to bid at the sale of
crown mining claims. He has never been
heard of since. He had a large sum of
money. w â¢" ", ;
Since these strange disappearances the
mounted police have decided to put on
patrols. One will start from each end and
make about thirty miles a day. It Is
thought that in this way better survelN
lance will be had over the tough char
acters who infest the trail.

SEATTLK Jan. 17.â The remains of
Henry C. Hendrickson, who died at Bol
lard May 31. 1300, of kidney trouble, were
burled in Mount Pleasant Cemetery yes
terday after private services. The delay
in the burial was due to indecision as
to whether the Interment should take
place In Seattle or Michigan and a furth
er' delay connected with the collection of
insurance money.
The case is remarkable, from the fact
that tha. body was In an absolutely per
fect state of preservation. The only
change In appearance from that imme
diately following death was a slightly
darker'- tint of the flesh, which hardened
like atone. Another peculiar feature was
that the body lost weight, but did not fall

TANFOBAN LEFT OUT
OF NEW JOCKEY CLUB
Move Made by ths Organizers in the
Interest of Harmony in Pacific
Coast Turf Affairs. .' 'v
CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â Representatives^ of
the race tracks which met here yester
day to form a new Western Jockey Club
held another session to-day, but post
poned the details of permanent organiza
tion until a special meeting In Chicago
about February I. The territory to be
covered by the new jockey club will ex
tend from Pittsburg to Denver, leaving
out Tanforan Park in California. This is
done not for any special reason, but be
cause the turfmen think It would weaken
the body to hAve a member so far re
moved from the central body. Tanforan
is willing to be left out, and suggests that
the coast clubs adopt the rules of tha
jockey club and co-operate with the new
organization, receiving protection In re
turn. This move will promote harmony
on the Pacific Coast, whereas if Tanforan
had been admitted to an exclusive organ
ization, Oakland, which was not even a
member of the Turf Congress, would In
all probability have resented the move.
CAREER OF PIONEER
CONTRACTOR CLOSES
Ex-Assemblyman Patrick Plover
Passes Away After an Illness
of Ten Days.
Ex-Assemblyman Patrick Plover, a pio
neer contractor and builder, who Was
identified with the construction of many
Â«'f the first schoolhouses built in this city,
died early Tuesday morning after an illâ
Tif-ss of ten days at the family residence,
725 Gough street. His death had been ex
pected for, several days.
Patrick Plover came to this State
in 1852 from Albany, N. Y. In
stead of following his friends to
the mines he settled In this city and en
gaged in the trade of contracting and
building. As at that time there was a
great demand for this kind of work he
fared about as well as those in the mines.
In 18S3 he was elected to the State Legls
| lature on the. Democratic ticket. His
course while in that body was character-
I Ized by strict integrity. He endeav
ored to introduce pure politics into the
! administration of the affairs of the State.
I After the expiration of his term of office
he engaged with great success in the real
estate business and succeeded in amass
ing a fortune estimated at half a million
dollars. His estate, which consists prlnci-
J pally of realty situated in the Mission,
was left to his wile and three chil
dren. The funeral will be private and will

day.

As a result of the controversy at the
Waldeck Sanatorium a number of the
physicians heretofore connected with that
institution yesterday filed articles of in
corporation of the Clara Barton Hospital
with the County Clerk. So far each of
the seven directors selected for the first
year has subscribed $1000, but all are
pledged to contribute up to $50,000, at which
figure the capital stock has been placed.
As much more money as may be neces
sary to erect and equip a thoroughly first
class establishment will, it is claimed, be
forthcoming.
Some time ago there was a lively meet
ing of the board of trustees over the posi
tion of an employe at the Waldeck. As
a result, several of the directors ex
pressed a willingness to resign. Then
other doctors got their heads together
with the dissenters ajid evolved a new
plan, and while they speak as they pass
by, they do not like to talk a great deal.
But as some of the most prominent mem
bers of the directorate of the Waldeck
are in the new Incorporation, a lively
scramble for cases is likely to follow.
The directors of the new hospital as
sociation are Drs. J. Henry Barbat,
George H. Evans, E. G. Frlsbie, Charles
A Dozier, Elmer E. Kelly, H. B. Kugeler
and F. B. Carpenter. Of these Drs.
Barbat and Carpenter were former mem
bers of the corporation conducting the
Waldeck. and Dr. Kelly is at present a
member.
According to statements made by one
of the interested physicians, the manage
ment of the Waldeck has been entirely
subject to the will of the president. Some
of the ' members thought, that if they
brought their patients there for treatment
they should not be subject to this dicta
tion and other alleged violations of pro
fessional ethics. They had various griev
ances against the management and so
decided that the best way out of their
difficulties was to start a hospital of their
A lot has been selected, plans have been
drawn and work will be commenced as
soon as the new directors can legally
complete the arrangements.

knocked down by a horse while on his
way to his home yesterday afternoon and
tocfived injuries which, according to the
elatement of the attending physician, are

Mr. Folsom resides at the Bella Vista
Hotel Â»t Fine and Taylor streets. It is
his custom w.hen returning from his office
to ride to gutter and Taylor streets on the
cars and then walk to his home.
As Mr. Folsom was cro^sine Bush street
je?terday afternoon a horse ridden by a
boy came galloping along. Mr. Folsom
fcpfirated for a moment and then started
for the Fidewaik. The crossing at the par
ticular Fpot is in a bad condition, due to
the tearing up of the rails of the old
Rush-street car line, and Mr. Folsom. who
is 75 jears of ape. was Impeded in his ef
fort to get out of danger. Before he could
lrach the corner the hor.Â«e ran with fuil
force into the old gentleman and threw
liim heavily to the pavement.
Passen by whu witnessed the accident
picked the prostrate man up and placing
him in a chair carried him to his hotel.
Mr. Fdaom was unable to *pi-ak and
fonn lnp^cd into uncuisciousiics*. A phy-

"In addition to this I was a complete

WHAT SHALLJVE EAT
To Keep Healthy and Strong?
A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow in matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats Is undoubtedly the best, in.
spite of the claims made by vegetarians
and food cranks generally.
As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat furnishes the most nutriment In a
highly concentrated form and Is digested
and assimilated more quickly than vege-
tables or grains.
Dr. Julius Remusson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run down
in health and of low vitality should eat
Flenty of meat. . If tha digestion Is too
eeble at first it may be easily strength-
ened by the regular use of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal. Two of
these excellent tablets taken after dinner
Â¦will digest several thousand grains of
meat, eggs or other animal food In thrc-_Â«
or four hours, while the malt diastase
also contained in Stuart's Tablets causÂ«os
the perfect digestion of starchy foods, lik<s
potatoes, bread, etc., and no matter how
: weak the stomach may be. no trouble will
' be experienced if a regular practice is
made of using Stuart's Dys epsia Tablets,
because they supply the pepsin and dias-
tase so necessary to perfect digestion, an 1
any form of Indigestion and stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach will
be overcome by their daily use.
That large class of people who come un-
der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
eat plenty of meat and insure its com-
plete digestion by the systematic use of
a safe, harmless digestive medicine lik*
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, composed of
i the natural disestive principles, oeptonea
and diastase, which actually perform th-Â»
work of digestion and give the abused
stomach a chance to rest and to furnish
the body and brain with the jiecessary
nutriment. Cheap cathartic medicines
1 masquerading under tae name of dyspep-
i sia cures are useless for relief or cure of
Indigestion because they R&v* absolutely
! no effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia in all its forms is simply a
failure of the stomach to digest food an?l
the sensible way to solve the riddle and
I cure the Indigestion is to make daily us^
! at mea! time of a safe preparation which
j Is endorsed by the medical precession ami
! known to contain active digestive prin-
! clples. and all this can truly be said of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Â¦ All druggists throuchout thÂ© United
! States, Canada and Great Britain sell
them at the uniform price of fifty cen'.j
for full treatment.

Nezu York Stock Market.
N*EW TORK, Jan. 17.â The state of mind of
thÂ« speculators to-day was one of extreme
nen-ousnefs. The cloud of distrust was some
what aifsersed during the course of the flay
and prices were laboriously Sifted to a level
above last night, but uneasiness recurred In
th* late dealings and the market closed with
urgent selling in force and with violent anJ
disorderly breaks In a number of Important
etocks. The excessive confusion of the price
movement during the early part of the day
â¢-erved to put speculators long of stock in a
nate of bewilderment. There was bold and
powerful manipulation used to support prices
and dissuade holders from selling. The ex
treme dullness into which the market fell after
the early selling movement had been checkeC
was proof of the success achieved by this
maneuver, but when it began to appear that
the marking up of prices had been simply for
the purpose of affording a market to realize on,
the pressure to sell became urgent again, lead
lnc to the final break In prices. The price
movement was 60 Irregular and mixed at all
times as to defy ar.y close analysis. The open
ing woa.kr.ee s wan most marked In the steel
group, and the conditions among the great
Â¦ted corporations continued Â¦ to excite grave
uneasiness during the session. The conviction
Is takjnc form in rpeculative circles that a
war betv.een the tsteel companies Is dangcrously
Immlnent. which if It comes, will demoralise
earnir.rÂ« In the trade. The tacit admission by
lrjiide authorities of a coming bond issue by
Federal Steel in accepted as foreshadowing a
coining strurg>. That etock had a further
decline of Zh% and Federal Eteel preferred of
2 ro'nts, or. account of this fear and declines

1 to 2 points. Meantime m&nlpulalive support
was effective In other, part* of the list and
Fuga-r. People's Gas, St. Paul, Manhattan and
a number of the Pacifies and Southwesterns
wrre lifted from 1 to 2 points. The support
xi-as accorded to the steel stocks and the prin
cipal members of the irroup. Including Federal
Steel. Tin Plate, Etecl and Wire and Esielt
lng. were lifted eharply above last night. Mean
time there was realizing In the railroad list
tnd prices reneral!y fell away with occasional
which w^re held up as a supjHirt
to the market. In the final slump the wholÂ«
lift fell ecain wflh very few exceptions below
last right. There were such violent breaks ts
4 !n Baltimore and Ohio, 4% In Manhattan
3% in Hrooklyn Trasnlt and Ore*t Northern
IiP"Jerrpa. 3U in Sugar and 2^j In Ht. Paul and
New Tork Central. Many cf the railroad
ftocks were at the lowest when the market
<-loc*d. The statement of President Hill of
th^ Great Northern that be had never owned
a share of Bt. Paul ctock In his life had a
preatly unsettling Influence on speculators who
have worked In the conviction that St. Paul
had passed to the control of the Oreat North
ern and Northern Pafiflc. The declaration of a
2 per cent dividend en New York. Chicago and
Bt. Ix)u'.s second preferred, where all the way
from I : * to 5 per cent had been confidently
predicted caused a readjustment of Ideas as
to a large number of analogous caees. The
denial of the rumor that Metropolitan Street
Us II way had leafed Manhattan Elevated upset
another line of speculative calculations. The
jnon^y rnjpply continues superabundant, but the
crowing belief that a notable outward move
ment of cold has begun served as an additional
drag en the market.
The bond market was rather quiet and lr
rerular. Total sales, par value. t2.92S.000.

CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â Liverpool did not fully
reflect the decline Jof l%c here yesterday, and
this was the cause of a moment's firmness in
wheat at the opening, which was He higher for
May at 75%c to 75%c. The same old stoneâlib
eral receipts and slack outside supportâ was
still fastened about the market's neck and the
first half hour saw a drop to 74H@"4^c under
fairly liberal selling. The selling pressure was
weakened long enough for a recovery to 74%c,
but trade was dull, and this attempt at recov
ery was soon abandoned and a relapse to 74V40
74Vio followed. Eruring the last fifteen minutes
May rallied sharply to 75c, at which the mar
ket closed, H'iJHc lower. This rally was, due
mostly to moderate covering by shorts on a
market that had been sold to a standstill. Their
buying was based partially on the report of ex
ports that 106 loads had been taken for foreign
shipment and partly on a desire to take profits,
as it was believed the foreign sales had been
made at good prices and that much of the
grain was of Inferior quality. Seaboard clear
ances in wheat and flour were equal to'53S,000
bushels.
Corn was stronger during part of the session,
although prices did bend a little early "In sym
pathy with the wheat weakness. The high
price of hogs, coupled with buying- by pro
vision Interests, the light country movement
and the continued poor grading of receipts were
the ruling factors. There was little or no ele
vator setting and a good cash demand, although
business was as usual hampered by lack of
cars. May closed %c higher at 38&@38%c. Oats
also exhibited individual strength, showing no
attention to the wheat weakness. The excel
lent cash demand, small movement and a re
port that big interests were long 15,000,000
bushels were the supporting Influences. The
corn strength was also a help. May closed
HQHc higher at 25Uo. " Â¦ '
Provisions were dull and neglected, but
steady on a moderate run of bogs, firm prices
at the yards and a good cash demand. May
pork closed 16c higher; May lard unchanged
and May ribs 2%c up. â¢ "
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Chicago reported considerable selling dur
ing the past three days. In consequence of
which all the local holders have let go to a

The Rebate on Prunes.
Mail advices frcra New York say: "The
trade was larpely oceupiel vesterdar with ef
forts to get atralghtened out on the prune
situation. There eee:r.s to have been a serious
mlEunderstandir.g here as well as on the coast
rt-garfiing the matter of rebates to Jobbers 00
goods r.ow tn etock. Many local houses re
ceived dispatches from California to the effect
that rebates would be granted to original buy
ers equivalent to the reduction In price, but
this apparently is not to be the case. All
yesterday's advices were to the effect that the
rebates were to be allowed on purchases yet
to be made, in c&t-e of a further reduction
from the prices Jutt Â»-ytublished. The question
1 f an allowance of a ca>Ji discount cf
IVi i>er cent also appeared In doubt.
"On the spot the reduction seetr.s to have
net changed the situation as yet. There is
t radically no demand fcr prune*, and the re
duction is not large enough to indues specu
lation. Raisins continue flnr.er. with a contin
uance of demand In a email way. Expori
business In all dried fruits is improving:,
though the ixlume of poods going out is net
larce"

CLOSING.
Americans were extremely Idle and closed
deDressed after a temporary flutter on early
buying from New York. Union Pacifies being
especially affected. The street was like a
Quaker meeting. The market regards the St.
Paul deal as off, expects a postponement of
the Erie dividend and would not relish it if it
were paid. The bank lost Â£50,000 gold to South
Africa.
The markets here were stagnant to-day.
Further failures of houses connected with the
Westrallan collapse were averted, but there
was considerable liquidation Instead.

NEW 'YORK. Jan. 17.â Speculation , In the
local metal market was again dormant. Trad-
Ing was of a small hand-to-mouth character,
with ' the general . trend of prices downward.
Tin,- In response to weak cables from London,
where prices went .oft, about Â£1 to Â£119 5s,
reacted about 35 points to-day and closed weak
at $26 15, against $26 50, the closing figure of
yesterday. Some small sales were made at
the decline. Copper though again scoring a
loss of 12s 6d in London to Â£71. ruled ex
tremely dull in the local market, with a some
what easier undertone. Closing prices were
$17 for Lake Superior and $16 62V4 for casting
ond electrolytic. Concessions were freely of
fered on the latter metal. Lead was dull: at
$4 37V4. the nominal price, while at London
prices went off 3s 9d to Â£16 13s. Spelter ruled
very dull all day at yesterday's decline, with
trading very slow at $4 10@4 15. Iron mar
kets, both domestic and foreign, were rather
quiet and largely nominal.

LIVERMORE BREWER EITHER THROUGH ACCIDENT OR BECAUSE
OF AN ATTACK OF VERTIGO PLUNGES TO A HORRIBLE DEATH
IN AN IMMENSE VAT OF BOILING MALT. \. . '
The accident was peculiarly distressing
from the fact that Mrs. Jordan and a
daughter, Miss Ada Jordan, about IS years
of age, were in the residence above the
brewery when the horrible death of the
husband and father occurred. The mother
and girl were busy with their household
duties and had not the slightest suspicion
of the tragic occurrence until friends had
been summoned to break the news. The
family Is prostrated.

how he fell. It Is possible he lost his
footing on the steps or was overcome by
the hot steam arising from the boiling
malt. " He had been cleaning some barrels
in the loft before the accident occurred."
OAKLAND. Jan. 17.-Wendell Jor
dan, prominent brewer of Liver
more, -was literally cooked to
death this morning In a vat of
boiling malt at his brewery. Jor
dan was standing at the top of a,stairway
working when he either slipped or was
seized with vertigo and plunged head first
Into the open vat, which was filled with
Bteaming malt In the first process of
brewing. Carl Grunitz. a workman, heard
a scream and ran to the vat opening, only
to soe his employer's body writhing in the
superheated mass of half-liquefled malt.
Grunitz yelled for assistance, and Thomas
Knox and John Thompson, who were
working outside the brewery, responded.
The body could not te reached by the
men. so they opened the faucets and ran
off the malt as quickly as possible. Then
the scalded form was dragged out. There
was one gasp from the unfortunate brew
er, and then -leath.
The accident > occurred about 10:30
o'clock. Jordan had been working, as
usual, preparing a new brew of beer. The
vat had been filled with malt and the fur
nace started several hours before. The
receptacle ts a tank about five feet deep
and from ten to twelve feet square, open
at the top. Here the malt is first treated.
Against the vat ran a flight of steps to
enable the brewer to watch the mass from
the top of the tank, as well as to reach
another part of the brewery. Grunitz
had been busy below tending the furnace,
but stepped out to get a drink of water.
"I saw Mr. Jordan standing on the steps
as I went out," said Grunitz. "As I came
back I heard a frightful scream, and I
rushed up to the vat, realizing that some*
awful accident had occurred. The malt
was boiling and steaming, and I could not
reach the body. Then I ran out to the
street, shouting for assistance. Tom
Knox and Johnson were working on a
sidewalk near by and they ran over.

The tried and sure foundations of our
liberty and national happlne&s have been
discredited. Reverence for our national
traditions has been relaxed and satisfac
tion with our country's mission has been
undermined. The restraints and limita
tions of our constitution have become
galling and irksome under the tempta
tions of natural greed and aggrandize
ment. Our love of peace, honor and Jus
tice has been weakened.
"War. even with the world's advanced
civilization, may still be sometimes nec
essary and justifiable: but whether neces
sary and justifiable or not, the demoral
ization that follows in Its train can never
be evaded. It teaches bloody Instructions
which in a country whose citizens do the
fighting cannot fall to leave their impress.
for a time at least, upon public and pri
vate life. In time of peace.
â¢â¢Thirty years after the close of the war
for the preservation of the Union a treaty
of arbitration was formulated between
the United States and Great Britain
which, if completed, would have gone far
toward removing every pretext of war be
tween the two countries. Thus these two
great English speaking nations then as
sumed leadership In the path of peace and
in advocacy of the abolition of war, with
the hope and expectation that the exam
ple would be followed by other nations
and that a more general adoption of arbi
tration as a means of settling interna
tional disputes would result in a great
advance toward the abandonment of war
throughout the world. This treaty failed
of confirmation in the Senate of the
United States. Less than five years have
passed and these English speaking cham
pions of peace and arbitration are still
operating on parallel linesâ one In the
Philippines and the other In South Af
ricaâbut no longer for peace and arbitra
tion Both are killing natives in an effort
to possess their lands. This indicates a
sad relapse, and in our case it is a most
serious one. If England succeeds In her
attempt in South Africa she will but ado
another to her list of similar acquisitions:
a brave people will be subjugated, and
because of our engagement of a similar
adventure in another quarter they will
miss the expressions of American sympa
thy which we are accustomed to extend
to those who struggle t for national life
and Independence. On the other hand,
with success in our subjugation effort a
new untried and exceedingly perilous slt
i uation will be forced upon us. We can
; conquer the Philippines, and alter con
quering them can probably govern them.
i It is in the strain upon our institutions.
! the demoralization of our people, the eva
! slon of our constitutional limitations and
r r the perversion of our national mission
I that our danger lies. As a distinguished
: Bishop has said: 'The question is not what
j we shall do with the Philippines, but what
the Philippines will do to us.*
! "Our country will never be the same
1 again. For weal or woe we have already
I irrevocably passed beyond the old lines.
'â¢ "The republic will in some sort be saved.
1 Shall It be only In name and semblance.
i with fair external appearance but with
! the germs of decay fastened upon its
I vitals, or shall it. though changed, still
1 survive in such vigor and strength as to
I remain the hope and pride of free Amer
icans?
â¢â¢The problem Is a momentous one. Its
! solution depends upon the extent to which
| the old patriotism and good sense of our
countrymen can be re?cued from lmper.d
! ing danger'. Thus these are sober days
! for thoughtful citizens â days for preach
; ingâ days for sermonizing. If we are to
| be saved from disasttr it must be through
! the cultivation and enforcement of that
; sort of conservatism that should find a
â¢ congenial home In the Holland Society.
| In the midst of reckless tumult and in
t the confusad rage of national greed and
! bloodiness this conservatism should de
| fiantly stand forth and demand a near
er Vandyke read a message which will
be sent to Queen "Wilhelmina of Holland
i as an address from the society on tha
j occasion of her approaching marriage.
At the conclusion of its reading a health
to the Queen was drunk standing.

CLEVELAND WOULD
BE CONSERVATIVE
Murray Hall, proprietor of an Intelli
gence office at 115 Sixth avenue, has been
a well known character in Sixth avenue
below Twenty-third street for more than
thirty years. Hall has furnished bail
bonds in Jefferson Market Police Court
during the last twenty years which
amount to (89,000. Two wives had borne
the name of Hall, and to-day an adopted
daughter. Minnie, a pretty young woman
a.bout 23 years old, is almost the sole
mourner. So well had Hall's secret been
kept that the tenants In 145 Slxtn avenue
had â¢ no suspicion, and it was not until
d*-ath came to Hall at half past U o'clock
Monday night that the true state of
afliairs became known. The physician
was perplexed about the filling out of the
death certirtcatfc. whether it should be
male or female, and sought the counsel of
Coroner Hart, a personal friend.
Hall was a well known tijrure in lower
Sixth avenue. She was much below th(=
mertiutn height. Her face was beardless,
filmota weazened, and there was no be
trayal of her true sex in her voice. Hall
was always considered a "hale feilow
well met." She neither smokc'l n<^r
chewed, but was well known in saloons.
although it was not freouent that Hall
would associate with companions in front
of the bar. Hall preferred a little Kick
room, and since the death of Mrs. Hall
two years apo the drinkinjr companions of
the so-called husband were for the most
part women with whom Hall became
acquainted in the office.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.â It has required
death to reveal the fact that a person
who was a mt' in her of Senator Bernard
F". Martin's Iroquola Club and a voter
in the city for more than thirty years, a
successful person of business in Lower
Sixth avenue and the respected husband
of two women, was a woman. Her daily
associates for more than twenty-five
years were astounded last night when
they learned the facts, and refused to
believe them.

"Owlngr to the appearance of trusts in

demn such trusts and their- methods,

prevent the formation of trusts, or will

RESOLUTIONS ADO-TTED
/ DENOTTNC-NG TRUSTS
The natives have effected a complete
organization of their force by amalgamat
ing their two leading organizations with
the. Independent Home Rule party, which
elected Robert W. "Wilcox to Congress at
the last election.. Delegates from the other
Islands held a convention on the
Sth and 9th lnst. By a unanimous reso
lution the Aloha Aina and the Kalalalna
-societies were merged Into the Home Rule
party. . This union means that all of the
discordant forces among the natives have
been satisfactorily settled and they have
already begun to gefready to hold the
political power which they secured at the
November election;. D. Kalauokalanl,
who was elected Territorial Senator, wa3
chosen president of the Home Rule party
for two years. Various committees were
selected.
The matter has not as yet been brought
to the attention of the authorities, but
there is a strong suspicion of even foul
play connected with the death of Naone.
The natives possess receipts for Â¦ making
strong vegetable poisons, which were, In
days gone by, administered by the ka
hunas to the people whom they wished
dead. A death certificate giving the cause
of demise as congestion of the brain was
signed by the white physician, but the
correctness of this diagnosis has been
questioned. 'Naone died either from the
effects of poison administered nurre'pti
tiously by the kahuna or else the fear
that he was being prayed to death by the
native witch doctor drove the man to his
death.
HONOL.UX.T7. yian. 10.â In the recent
death of Daniel JL. Naone, a prominent
Hawaiian, many natives believe thev
recognize evidence of the power of the old
witch doctors to . bring death upon their
enemies. Naone was one of the most ad
vanced of the llawalians and after the
overthrow of the monarchy accepted the
political faith of the whites. For this act
he gained the resentment of many of his
race. About the middle of December
he was told by a "kahuna." which is the
native name for a witch doctor, that there
was a red devil sitting on his right shoul
der and he would die. In spite of the fact
that he had embraced the Christian reli
gion. Naone became terror-stricken and
on December 21 took to his bed. claiming
that his right side was paralyzed. This
was the Identical side on which the ka
huna had declared the red devil was Bit
ting. A physician was called and he dis
covered that the patient was not suffering
from paralysis, for on the second day
Naone was able to move about in bed and
talked of going back to his work. He
had improved on the thlÂ»l day. The fol
lowing day, which was December 24, a
kahuna was allowed to visit the patient
during the absence of the white physician.
A second visit was paid on Christmas day
by the native witch doctor. What he said
to Naone is not known, but lt must have
been to repeat the threat of death, for
Naone seemed to lose all hope and when
the doctor returned It was to .find Naone
past all hope of recovery.
Sis Shoulder and His
Doom Was Sealed.
Takes to His Bed Upon Being Told
a Bed Devil Was Seated Upon
Mysterious Demise of Daniel
Naone, a Native Ha
waiian.
WITCH DOCTOR
CAUSES DEATH
Then ex-Judge Francis Scott led in the
summing up for the defense. He was
followed by Michael 'Dunn. Their ad
dresses were very similar. They declared
that no case had been made out against
"Walter McAlister. William Death and
Andrew Campbell. They ridiculed the ex
pert testimony and branded the hackman,
Sculthorpe. as' a man of the lowest type
and of the basest motives. They main
tained that. the story told by him was
not supported by evidence and that It was
a lie. Mr. Scot: made a. point that If Scul
thorpe's story were to be believed at all,
he should be a v prisoner accused of par
ticipation In the crime. Mr. Scott was
arguing that the State had failed to prove
its first count, that of assault, when
Judge Dixon Interrupted him. saying:
"Before you proceed I want the Jury to
understand that if chloral were given, i r
if a person were struck or choked In order
to accomplish the assault, the poison or
violence Is a part of the assault. The
Jury must not be misled on that point."
Counsel for the defense asserted that
chloral had not been administered to the
girl. The defense maintained that it had
not been proven that any of the defend
ants had purchased chloral or that the
bottle, -alleged to have been found near
the dead girl, belonged to any of the pris
oners. They declared that none of th-;
medical testimony offered had shown that
the girl had been assaulted. It is be
lievea that the case will go to the Jury
to-morrow afternoon. ' " .
Mr. Shaw, in summing up, claimed that
the State had proven its case and that
Ha every contention had been sustained.
He denounced the accused, who, he said,
had taken the girl out to do her to death
like a dog-.. He demanded that the jury
render such a verdict as the Â¦ law and
the evidence demandedâ one of guilty In
the highest , degree. .**
PATEESON, N. J., Jan. 17.â For the en
tire session to-day opposing counsel In
the Jennie, Bosschleter murder trial ap
pealed to the jury. Assistant Prosecut
ing Attorney Ralph Shaw began the sum
ming up for the State. It was expected
that Mr. Emley would do this, but ne
merely offered in evidence the undergar
ment said to have been. a 'part of Jenn's
Bosschleter's wardrobe.
Prosecuting Attorney Demands That
the Jury Bender a Verdict of
, Guilty in the Highest /.V.

Judge Dalngerfield's counsel, . but the
court withheld a ruling on them until this
morning. If the objections Â¦ should " be
sustained, and it, is generally believed
they.- will -be. Judge Dalngerfleld's total
galnlX^r the day will be . twenty-six votes
and will increase his lead to sixty. â¢
That there will be abundant work for
the Supervisors' Committee on Charter
Amendments and the expert to be ap
pointed by the board to outline necessary
amendments to the new organic law of
the city was again demonstrated yester
day. Auditor Wells discovered a glaring
Inconsistency in the charter which will
cause trouble when the Supervisors come
to make up the tax budget for the next
fiscal year. As a result- the elusive "sur
plus" fund, from which It was attempted
to make appropriations at ' least four
times, will disappear in thin air.
The Auditor will direct the attention of
the Board of Supervisors to the Incon
sistency in a few days. He will refer
them to the section on finance and taxa
tion, which says:
"The surplus fund shall be used for the
purposes and In the order following:
. "1. In payment of any final Judgment
against the city and county.
"2. In .liquidation and extinguishment
under such regulations as the Supervis
ors may adopt of any outstanding funded
debt of the city and county.
"3. To be carried over and apportioned
among the funds and used in the ensu
ing fiscal year as part of the income and
revenue thereof."
There is no outstanding funded debt, so
according to the terms of the charter the
surplus must be carried over and appor
tioned among the funds used in the next
fiscal year after the final Judgments have
been paid. Here is where the difficulty
comes in. Another section provides that
the tax levy and budget must be fixed
and adopted before the last Monday in
June, , Â¦which falls this year on June 24.
Now Auditor Wells declares that it will
be absolutely Impossible to ascertain the
amount oi the surplus fund on June 24.
as claims against tne municipality for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, will be pre
sented to him as late as September. Only
then will the actual amount of the sur
plus fund, which must be taken Into ac
count In the new budget, be known. Only
the revenue from other sources, such as
license taxes, rents, etc., can be esti
mated. No estimate can be made on the
surplus by June 24, as> bills will come In
for three months thereafter. Serious
complications will undoubtedly result. It
may be contended that any claims filed
against the surplus fund subsequent to
June 24 are illegal, as the charter provides
that the surplus shall be apportioned in
the next budget. Again the fact that the
specific amount of the surplut will not be
known on June 24 will result In' that fund
remaining Idle in the city treasury, as It
will be Impossible to apportion it.
Will Caust Serious Compli
cations in the Next
Tax Levy.

Before the Superior
Court.
James Sweeney, a longshoreman, was

of salt and In a few minutes a truck was
driven to the warehouse and Sweeney was
with it. After the truck was about half
loaded the suspicions of the manager were
aroused and he telephoned to Plummer &
Co., who said they had not ordered any
salt. A policeman was called in and
Sweeney was arrested.
John Mullen, a lusty beggar, was sent to
the County Jail for three months by
Judge Cabanlss yesterday on a charge of

BOLD ROOM THIEF
CATTGHT BY POLICE
Thomas Williams Arrested for Steal
ing From a Number of Lodging 1
Houses. \ â¢
A daring room thief, who gave his name
as Thomas Williams, was captured last
night by Detectives Harper and Arm
strong and; Police Officer Pat .Sullivan
and locked up in the City Prison.
During the last week a number of rooms
In Â¦ various lodging houses have been
broken, into by -Williams and considerable
booty, consisting* principally of clothing,
taken. Most of the stolen property has
been recovered from pawnshops, where It
was disposed: of by the prisoner. He will
be formally charged- to-day.
. "With marked impresslveness and amid
profound tokens of grief the funeral ser
vices over the body of the late Dr. R.
Beverly Cole, Coroner of the city and
county of San Francisco, were held yes
terday afternoon at the Masonic Temple.
The services were according to the ritual
of California Commandery No. 1 of the
Knights Templar, of which the deceased
was a member. The large lodgeroom of
the Masonic Temple was far too small to
accommodate .those who wished to take
part in the funeral rites.
Exalted Commander F. Titus of the
California Commandery of Knights Tem
plar'was one of the mourners, being a
life-long friend of Dr. Cole, and General
issimo Carroll Cook acted as exalted com
mander. Seventy-eight Sir Knights were
present in full regalia and occupied seats
in the body of the lodgeroom. The black
covered and sliver decorated casket re
posed on a bier in the center of the cham
ber and was buried beneath floral tributes
sent by city officials, medical societies and
relatives. The Masonic regalia of the de
ceased was on top of the casket.
Beautiful and solemn was the ritual
conducted by the Knights Templar. Sir
Carroll Cook delivered the opening ad
dress and was followed by Prelate W. E.
Church, the knights making the responses.
The Masonic quartet then sang the hymn
".With Tearful Eyes I Look Around," and
Commander Carroll Cook then called upon
Past Commander General "W. H. L. Barnes
to deliver the funeral oration.
General Barnes never spoke more elo
quently. He dwelt upon the fact that it
was in the very chamber all were Â¦ gath
ered in that he, the speaker, had Initiated
Dr. Cole as a brother Templar. All doubt
which existed In the mind of Dr. Cole as
to the immortality of the soul was swept
aside when he was initiated, and to his
death he remained true to the obligations
of the order. An eloquent tribute was
paid by General Barnes to the good quali
ties of the dead man, and his professional
distinction was also dwelt upon. Whatever
faults the deceased might have had were
outweighed by his many virtues. A sweet,
loving and charitable heart had endeared
him to all, and his memory will always
be cherished. The voice of the speaker
broke as he finished his oration by say-
Ing: "Dear friend, brave Sir Knight, may
God who has loved you take you home to
his eternal bosom now And forever more,
amen." The quartet then sang "Sleep,
Brother, Sleep," and the Knights Templar
marched from the chamber while the
quartet rendered "Good-night, Good-night,
It Is Morning Now." Â¦
The procession was then formed to the
street. Ahead marched the Templars,
pallbearers and city officials; then came
the flower-strewn casket, followed by the
sorrowing relatives, '-ne lront of the Ma
sonic Temple was densely crowded with
spectators, who stood silently as the
casket was placed In the hearse, a mili
tary band meanwhile playing the hymn
"Nearer My God to Thee."
Thousands of . citizens witnessed the
procession as it marched to the depot at
Third and Townsend streets, where spe
cial cars were In waiting to convey the
funeral party to Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
At the cemetery the ritual of the Knights
Templar was observed, and as Musician
Bennett sounded "taps tha casket with
its wealth of flowers was gently lowered
through the floor of the chapel to the cre
matory beneath, where the body of Dr.
Cole was incinerated.
The pallbearers were: Dr. J. E. Young:
er and Adolph Meyer, representing Cali
fornia Commandery: Colonel Murphy and
Henry Highton of Occidental Lodge; Drs.
Kerr, Â¦Williamson, McLean, Lewltt, Von
Hoffman, Leland andMcCone; Major Box
ton, representing the Board of Supervis
ors and Mayor Phelan.
The widow of Dr. Cole was unable to
be present at the funeral on account of
old age and grief. The attaches of the
Coroner's office were represented by Dep
uty Coroner McConnick. They Bent a
large floral tribute.
