In works of charity Mr. Armour's monu
ment will be found In the Armour Insti
tute, to which but a short -time ago he
gave $750,000 in one remembrance. Asked
once what he considered his best paying
Investment he replied, "The Armour In
stitute." The institute to-day represents
an Investment on the part of Mr. Armour
and his brother Joseph of $2,750,000. and a
yearly expense for maintenance of $100,000.
The property interests "for which Mr.
Armour stood are estimated at $150,000,000.
His personal share of this property Is
variously estimated at from . $25,000,000 to
$50,000,000. .
The commercial sense, which always
predominated In his life, Indicated its
presence as soon as he saw the gold fields
of California. He made money from the
start, and at the end of six years he re
turned home with a fortune. Becoming
dissatisfied with the quiet life of his na
tive town he came "West again and, to
gether with a brother-in-law, established
a large wholesale grocery house In Mil
waukee. This venture was also success
ful, and In a year's time he purchased the
largest grain elevator In Malwaukee. This
led to more elevators and railroad stock.
In 1866 he came to Chicago to take charge
of the Chicago branch of a New York
packing establishment. The result was
that the Chicago house ceased to be a
branch and the West. gained the largest
packing and provision plant In the world.
CHICAGO. Jan. 6.â Philip IX Armour
was born on a farm at Stockbrldge,
Oneida County, New York, May 6. 18?2.
The California gold fever struck "Western
New York in 1343, and young Armour was
the first in Stockbridge to determine to
visit the Pacific Coast. He obtained the
permission of his parents, and at the age
of 17 started with three or four compan
ions "from the same neighborhood. Tho

party walked nearly the entire distance

The news of Mr. Armour's death spread
rapidly through the city, and to-night
there were many callers at the Prairie
avenue mansion. Mrs. Armour retired to
her apartments and during the evening
saw only the members of her family.
WAS A CALIFOBNIA ABGONATJT.
"We were not altogether unprepared for
my father's death." said J. Ogden Ar
mour. "AH the members of the family
had been here since the relapse of this
morning In anticipation of the most se
rious turn of events."
"He looked upon such holdings." said
Dr. Billings, /'as. Investments rather than
from the speculative view point."
who had been almost constantly In at
tendance upon the sick man, stated to
night that he had heard Mr. Armour make
no mention ot his interest in or profits
arising from the gigantic Milwaukee-
Great Northern deal, by which he was re
puted to have made from $3,000,000 to $5,
000.000 last week.
"In his great wheat deals he has always
had ready cash. In times of panic he has
shown vast resources In spot cash. In
1S93 when a run was made upon the banks
of Chicago and the credit of the city and
the fate of the exposition was hanging In
the balance, Philip D. Armour bought a
half million dollars of gold, in Europe and
offered help to the big institutions of the
city from his cash resources In Chicago.
With a business of $100,000,000 a year In
the packing department alone, a grain
business of half that amount, and practi
cally the owner of a great railway sys
tem, the estimates of his wealth at the
utmost figure appear modest Â¦ instead of
exaggerated."
Dr. Frank Billings, who,was at Mr.-'Ar
mours bedside when tho end came and
"Mr. Armour's wealth is a subject that
may never be accurately known. It is
estimated to be not less than $30,000,000
and by some is said to exceed $50,000,000.
The combined wealth of the Chicago Ar
mours Is fixed at $60,000,000, In one sense
the total is the wealth of Philip D. Ar
mour, but Just how much has been carried
in his own name and how much In the
name of his sons is unknown. He has not
been a borrower. He has always been
able to pay cash for. his purchases, and he
has never asked a customer to discount a
bill.
Mr. Armour was a heavy owner in the
Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad
Company and in the reorganized Balti
more cud Ohio. He was interested large
ly in the Illinois Trust and Savings Com
pany, Metropolitan National and North
ern Trust banks of Chicago, and In the
Armour Bank of Kansas City. He was a
director of the Northwestern Life Insur
ance Company, and was a heavy stock
holder in the company which controls ttie
street railways of Kansas City.
Referring to Mr. Armour's fortune, the
Chicago Chronicle to-morrow will say:
While Mr. Armour's name was more
generally associated In the public mind
with the great packing and provision
establishments In which he was Interested
and which do an annual Dusiness exceed
ing one hundred million dollars, employ
twenty thousand persons and have repre
sentatives in every city of importance in
the world, he was actively Interested In
many other big enterprises. As the owner
of an Important system of grain elevators
and as a heavy Investor In the grain pro
ducts of the Middle and Western States.
Mr. Armour was an important factor in
the grain markets of the world.
"I have lc*3t the best friend I had on
earth and can say nothing further to
night," was the way Rev. Frank W. Gun
ealus expressed himself on the death of
Mr. Armour. The dead millionaire and
Mr. Gunsalus, president of the Armour
Institute., have been very firm friends.
During Mr. Armour's sickness he has
been a dally visitor, and he was at the
bedside when Mr. Armour died.
Estimates of Mr. Aimour's own estate
run from $10,000,000 to $25,003,000. This, of
course, docs r.ot include the $15,000,000 or
$20,030,000 owned by *.he young members
of the family. For years every enter

the last three years.

the properties. Some vears previously the

under the title of the Armour Elevating
Company. The death of Simeon B. Ai
mour at Kansas City in March. 1599, caus
ed no particular chance In the Armour
Interests there, as they were operated as
a stock company.
So carefully had the plans for the fu^
ture been made that the death of Mr. Ar
mour will have little effect on the out

with which he had beÂ°n so closely identi

properties will be hetd intact until thr
grandchildren come into their own.

Tfce death of his son, Philip d. Armour
Jr., In Southern California on January 29,

to his father, and was taken suddenly
with pneumonia. His death followed with
scarcely a day's warning. The son had
Inherited the business ability of the Ar
mours, and was closely following the
footsteps of his father when stricken.
His beautiful home, completed but a year
or two before, at Michigan and Thlrty
pÂ»venth streets, told of his love of art.
'Jr. Armour waÂ» not able to accompany
the funeral party to Chicago. When he
<5id return he went direct to Oconomowoc
and remained there until the chilly
weather in the fall drove the summer cot
tp.rers to this city.
When he returned to Chicago that fall
he was looking well, and his friends
hrped his recovery was complete. He
went to Danforth Lodge, the * summer
home of his son, Philip D. Armour Jr.,
ct Occr.omoxroc Lake, Wla., and remained
there until nearly winter.- Then he Jour
neyed to Pasadena, in Southern Califor
nia, for the cold months. At the time he
â¢was at Ocononiowoc he made weekly
trips to his office in the Home Insurance
fcuilding, and was receiving constant re
ports of the general drift of his busi
ness affairs. . *
His treadmill of work and his firm grip
on affairs were maintained until the
Faring of 1833. Then the machine began
to show signs of breaking. Mr. Armour
was reported to be a sick man. and these
reports were confirmed when he sailed for
Germany to take baths at Eadnauheim.
He spent most of the cummer at tha
hatfcs. and was sufficiently restored to
health to take a trip to Switzerland,
where he remained a month In thÂ»
mountains.
Mr. Armour had lost strength stadlly
from Â£ay to day since the commencement
cf the winter. The pneumonia was check
ed, but strength was not regained. ThÂ«
tlrzn grip he had so lor.g maintained upon
the business cf Armour & Co., Tvhethir
at the office or thousandsof miles away,
p:Â«*a<3i!y relaxed. Reports no longer in
terested him. as they were wont to do
during the first months of his declining
hf-alth. The sudden death of his son
ar<J namesake, nearly a year ago, hung
heavily on him during the closing months
of his life. In fact he never recovered
from the shock he exc-exlenced from that
event. It stopped his progress toward re
covery In his winter hcrac at Pasadena,
and Its sorrow remained fresh until the
end.
For several days deaih had been feared
as the outcome by the close associates of
the great captain of industry- They
realized that the decline from day to day
did not cease, and ihat there could be
but ore end. When death came his grand
children, who had so Ucse a place in his
hÂ«*art. were at the family residence, as
was J. Ogden Armour. tfie surviving son.
Mr. Armour's death came after two
r, ars of Illness, during which time he vis
its German baths, passed the cold months
in Southern California, and devoted him
self largely In an attempt to restore his
health, which, however, had been broken
never to be regained. For several weeks
he had been living at the old family home
on Prairie avenue, the usual trip to
Southern California not having been
taken this winter. He came down to. the
oJUce of the Hone Insurance building but
sejdom, and as the cold increased he d.M
not cone at all. It was understood In tha
.office that he had had an incipient attack
of pneumonia., but it was given out no
later than a week ago that he was on
the road to recovery. It was noted, how
ever, that the constant attendance of the
family physician at the bedside of the
fSek man did cot corroborate the favora
ble reports at the downfown office.
Soon sfter luncheon, and just before the
physician forbade his talking more, Mr.
Armour In feeble tones said that he would
like to hear the Lord's Prayer read. One
r t the trained nurses who had been at
tending him drew a chair to ~ae bedside
;:r.d slowly read Irom the Bible the prayer
for which the dying man had asked. It
was read sentence by sentence, and each
was repeated by Mr. Armour. When the
"anen" had been repeated by him he
sank back on the pillow and closed his
eye* restfully.. It was the last word the
great financier spoke, except feeble fare
vrils to his family a little later.
The rnhlionalre retained consciousness
until within an hour cf his death. During
the day he realized that death was
near. To those around him he had said:
"I know I am very sick, and am ready
for death when St comes."

home. 2115 Pra'rie avenue, at 5:43 o'clock

heart, known as myocarditis, was the Im
mediate cause of death. He had been
plowly recovering from pneumonia that
for three weeks had been threatening his
life. At 9 o'clock this rnorr.in? his heart
pave way under the strain of bis recent
illness, his pulse running up to 103. That
was the beginning cf the end.

BALTIMORE, Jan. 6.â Cardinal Gib
bons to-day delivered a sermon at high
mass in the cathedral in which he re
viewed briefly the events of the century
just closed, with sp%clal reference to the
wars which have been waged during that
period as a preface to an urgent plea for
universal peace. He Incidentally touched
upon the subject of the proposed Increase
of the standing army in this country,
pointing out the evil results arising from
the maintenance of large bodies of armed
men In Europe and expressed the hope
that similar conditions may never obtain
In this country-
Cardinal Gibbons be^an by saying that
the mission of Christ was one of peace.
He continued:
"Before the advent of Christ war was
the rule, peace the exception, throughout
the world. But although wars are less
frequent and less Inhuman in the.Chris
tian dispensation than in pagan times, it
must be confessed that we are as yet far
removed from the millennium of universal
peace.
"At this moment, after an enormous ex
penditure of men and money, England is
endeavoring to bring to a successful close
her war with the South African republics.
It Is stated that thia campaign will cost
England six hundred million dollars.
"And how does our own country, stand
on ; the- .. subjeet-kof , war? AUKtnRh^ the
cornerstone of the constitution is peaca
with all nations and entangling alliances
with none, we have had on our hands
four wars in the century Just brought to
a close. In 1812' v.*e were engaged in the
war with Great Britain, which was justi
fiable on our part because it was a' war
of defence. In 1846 the Mexican war oc
curred. Our terrible civil war began In
1861, lasting four years, and we have re
cently closed the war with Spain, which
resulted In the loss to her and in the ac
quisition by us of all her foreign pos
sessions.
"When we read of a great military cam
paign our imagination revels in the con
templation of the heroic achievements of
famous generals. "We listen with rapture
to the clash of arms, the shouts of the
victors and the sound of martial music.
We seem to catch the spirit of enthusi
asm by which the combatants were ani
mated. â¢
"But we take no note of the shrieks and
aconles of the soldiers weltering In their
b.ood on the battlefields. We have no
thought of the sick and wounded lying in
hospitals and prisons.' We are unmindful
of sorrowing wives and mothers at home
weeping and sighing for the loved ones
far away.
"It Is a subject of great concern to the
friends of the gospel of peace that Chris
tian Europe presents to-day the spectacle
of n. hugo military camp.
"May God so guide our legislators and
statesmen that thoy may never be be
trayed into Imitating European Govern
ments by the establishment of formida
ble standing armies. God forbid that we
ourselves, flushed with recent victories,
should ever become Intoxicated with the
wine of lmperallsm or militarism, but may
we always follow the traditions of th^t
fathers of the republic. â¢ ..
"Hitherto we have presented to the
world a beautiful-spectacle. Europeans
accustomed at home to meet a sollder or
gendarms.at every street corner, on ar
riving in this country have been filled with
surprise and admiration that a nation cf
so vast i an extent and with such an Im
mense population contains an army of on
ly 25,000 men. They have been forcibly im
pressed with the fact that they can travel
from' Maine to California without meeting
a single soldier. They see that every cit
izen of the United States Is a soldier with
out uniform, engaged In the active pur
suits of life and ready at a moment's no
tice to defend his country. They would
feel that we are a strong nation because

began flocking to his rooms. Several of
them came willing to sign the call, but no
one wished to commit himself until ha
knew Just how the situation lay. There
was not much to be done until the arrival
of the 9:45 train from the city, for both
sides had men coming and the fight was
In such shape that every man was needed.
The Pendleton men were confident and
the Anderson men were equally so. They
knew there were not Republicans enough
in the Pendleton faction to organize the
House, and If they stayed out the organ
ization would be tied up, caucus .or no
caucus.
It was at this time that a persistent ru
mor of the possible candidacy of Dunlap
started. Dunlap bad withdrawn several
days ago. He had pledged to him mem
bers enough to make hÂ» candidacy worth
considering, but when he withdrew they
deserted him. 8everal were approached
on the subject, but the Pendleton men had
gathered In a great many and they re
fused to consider their promises to Dunlap
as binding. The report of his candidacy
continued during the day, and be himself
would neither deny nor affirm It It was
hoped that- If Anderson lost on the first
day. Dunlap might re-enter the race 'and
win on the second, but the main fight
seemed to have overshadowed all o'hen '
and he developed no strength during the
day.
After the 9:<5 train arrived with what
was supposed to be the last of the'legis
lators on board it was found that Pendle
ton still lacked some of his men. He
openly claimed Rutherford, but Ruther
ford was not forthcoming. It was
thought, too. that Knight was one of the
defecting ones, but Knight got lost soraâ
where, and after he was given up he came
into the Golden Eagle, sought Pendleton's
rooms and signed the call. He was the
last of the bunch. B3B

first, last and all the time. His signature
of the rollcall was the first sign of weak
ness in the Pendleton camp that the cau
cus call developed. They hoped, no Ander-
Bon men would be necessary, but they
signed.
Mellck of Los Angeles -was the flr^t man
of the Anderson camp to sign the call. He
said two days ago that he would go Into
short and had to call upon some of the
Anderson men to help them out.
Since last evening Pendleton had been
claiming that he had men enough to force
a caucus If he wished and that he could
even organize the House If hÂ© were driven
to It. but it was not until to-day that it
was boldly stated by his men that he
counted on the assistance of some Demo
crats to do so. At 2 o'clock one of Pen
dleton's men went over to the Capital Ho
tel and called upon Anderson, but Ander
son was not yet willing to commit him
self. From that time on the Pendleton
faction took this as a refusal to sign and
the caucus call went around openly. It
was in Pendleton's rooms In the Golden
Eagle, and all through this afternoon his
men came and went and obediently

he started it around his own circle. It
was the object of the Pendleton men to
get lorty-one names to the call from their
own ranks, but results show that they fell

the call, which he had made out, and he
asked Anderson to sign It, giving as a rea
son that Anderson -was the senior mem
ber of the House and also was the first on
the roll call. He said he was determined
to caucus in the morning. Anderson ob
jected to the hotir, and finally said he
would confer with his friends, decide upon
his course and eive an answer at 2 o'clock.

All day those who had arrived early

steadily that members of the two houses
and of the two rival camps agreed that
past Legislatures had failed in their duty
in not making an appropriation to roof
the street between the hostelnes where
the politicians congregate. ...
For the most part the discussion was
rarried on in Fmall groups and related
largely to the Speakership. The contest
for <-hief clerk received more than Â¦ Its
fhare of attention, so much eo that the
managers of the more important fight be

OMAHA, 'Jan. 6.â A letter has been
turned over to Chief Donahue of the
pmaha police department In which an of
t^r is made to deliver certain information
to him regarding the abductors of Eddie
Cudahy upon the Chief's compliance with
certain conditions. The Chief and Mr.
Cudahy evidently considered the letter
authentic and of enough Importance to
justify a reply, because the following ad
vertisement appeared In the columns of a
local paper this morning:
"Your request, asked for In letter mailed
at Lincoln on January 4. to be answered
before January 7. will be granted.
"E. a. CUDAHY,
"J. A. DONAHUE."
Both Mr. Cudahy and Chief Donahue
declined to-night to say what the contents
of the Lincoln letter were or â¢ to refer to
the conditions prescribed therein. It Is
ptated that the letter is from a man who
knows every member of the gang which
kidnaped Eddie Cudahy on December 6.
Further, It is stated positively that the
revelations to be made by the writer of
the letter will irivolvo a well-known man
in this city, who has been suspected but
against whom no positive evidence could
be obtained. The acceptance of the offer
of the unknown writer leads to the belief
that he has placed a price on his knowl
edgo of the crime and has taken this
means, to protect himself from discovery,
as he gave no address In his letter, advis
ing that an advertisement be inserted If
his proposition v/ere considered favorably.

CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 6.â The
, United States training ship
Buffalo, which arrived at La
Guayra yesterday, left to-day for
Manila.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.-It is paid by
the State Department officials that no
orders have been sent to Minister Loomls
at Caracas. Venezuela, contemplatinx the
use of United States marines in the ex
isting difficulties over the rival asphalt
company concessions. The department
is makinjj a careful inquiry into the con
troversy and If the results warrant such
action representations on the subject will
be made to tho Venezuelan Government
with a view to securing an immediate
settlement of the matter.
It) the meantime, Vern-suela Is. expected
to refrain from attempting to dispossess
the'New York and Bermudez Company of
its pitch lako concession. The. Caracas
officials will be given to understand that
the United States will not permit the
ousting of the. New York and Bermudez
company rrom disputed property untu xne
Venezuelan Supreme Court shall have an
nounced Its decision on pending suits." It
was reported that Commander Hutchlns
of tho Buffalo has been ordered to co
operate with Minister Loomls In backing
up demands of this Government and
obtaining justice for the American com
pany, but the sailing of the Buffalo for
Manila shows that such extreme action
is not contemplated.
This trouble, which it was feared might
lead to a. breach of friendly relations oe
t\veen the United States and Venezuela,
is the outgrowth of an attempt to dis
possess the New Tork and Bermudez
Company of a concession embracing val
uable pitch lakes, control of which a rival
corporation is attempting- to obtain. Suits
are now pending before the Supreme
Court of Venezuela to settle the claims of
tho two corporations, and the State De
partment at WashinRton simply asks that
the New York and Bermudez Company be
undisturbed until these cases shall have
been decided.

Mr/Anderson's ability and Impartiality as
a presiding officer were not called in ques
tion. Hs knowledge of parliamentary law
was never brought into question during
the contest. He made no pledges or
promises and conducted his campaign la
a manner creditable to himself and his
supporters. He Is still animated, by a
patriotic desire to gerve the best Interests
of the State, hoping in that service to
fctrengthon the Republican party. His
stanch supporters', who ask no other re

vote for him in the face of the fact that

FOUR CONTESTS
FOR SEATS IN

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA

Assembly will caucus to-morrow morning
at 11 o'clock. They will agree on the man
for the complimentary vote, probably
Cowan of Santa Rosa, decide to be quiet
and get what they can, and adjourn. Bert
Schleslnger Is the only one mentioned
for the chairmanship' of the caucus.
The three cornered contest for the chief
clerkship alone remains to promise a gust
of excitement In the organization of the
lower house.
Rev. J. B. Wilson of Pomona and Rev.
F. W. Fischer of Sacramento are seeking
the position of chaplain of the Assembly.
Four contests for seats will come before
the Assembly. From tho Twenty-eighth
District E. F. Lacey is contesting Frank
lin's seat. Thomas J. Horan is contesting
Collins* seat from the Twenty-ninth dis
trict. Joseph X. Strand is contesting
Butler's seat from the Thirty-third. Lon
Henry's seat from tho Forty-second Dis
trict is being contested by "W. D. Wasson.
The Assembly will face one condition
that Is full of embarrassment. The
amended Belshaw act, under which the
Assembly will oiVanlze, omits, so It has
been discovered, to provide for the ap
pointment of clerks of committees. In
consequence it will be necessary to rush
through an amendment correcting the
oversight or to make such appointment
by a three-fifths affirmative vote in each
case.
The contest for the chief clerkship of
the Assembly Is still an open one. with
strength that must bo taken Into con
sideration back of each of the three can
didates. The geographical argument may
be used against Clio Lloyd of Santa Bar
bara now that Pendleton has won the
Speakershlp, but it 1*> generally believed
that he and "Jim" Oliver of Berkeley are
neck and neck In the race. Lloyd was
approached to-day with a proposition of
a union of his and Wanzer's forces, but
refused to consider It. He was not In a
position to turn the chief deputyship over
to Wanzer and his reply was that he was
willing to let it remain an open fight and
to abide by the decision of the caucus.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA

Lieutenant Governor Jacob H. Neff. Its
officers will be: Thomas Flint Jr. of San

don of San Jose, secretary, and Lou Mar
tin of San Francisco, 6ergeant at arms.
There will be no contests In any of these
offices. Lieutenant Governor Neff has not
come into town yet, and so but little Is
known of the committees.
The finance committee Is generally con
ceded to Smith of Bakersfleld. He was
to have been made its chairman' at the
last session, but he was sidetracked in
favor of Dickinson. Possible candidates
for the Judiciary Include Davis, Taylor,
Wolfe and Simpson. Davis is most often
mentioned for the place, but length of
service puts the others ahead of him. If
Davis should not get It, it Is certain he
will be given the committee on mines and
mining.
Luchslnger Is looking for the Public
Buildings Committee. Rowell will get
something better than, the Hospitals Com
mittee, which he had last session, and
Lardner is spoken of for the Mines and
Mining Committee in case Davis gets the
Judiciary. :
The Republican Senators will caucus to
morrow morning. Smith will probably be
chairman. The: question ;â¢ of patronage
will be the principal business and It may
result lnÂ«a disappointment to many, it
has been proposed to make the patronage
the same as last year, which made an al
lowance to each Republican of nearly $11
There are more Republicans to divide
this year, however, and so the allowance
will be cut. down to about $9 75. This, to
those who have been speculating on-$14
or flB, may be sufficient to bring out
strength enough to raise the limit.
Miss Luchslnger will be postmistress of

LONDON. Jan. 6.â The British bark
Beechbank. Captain Buchanan, from San.
Francisco August 7 for Queenstown. was
spoken on January S In latitude 36 north,
longitude 38 west, and Is reported as hav
ing lost foretopmast and main topgallant

SEIKTA-TORS.
; Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢WASHINGTON,- Jan.
pf the reappolntment bill .will be resumed
to-morrow. In the House, v Indications
point to a final voteupon the.measure on
Tuesday, but the" fight over the basis of
apportionment is a bitter one and the de
bate may be prolonged. The outcome is
not clear. Hopkins i3 still confident that
his bill. will carry, but in order to pull
it through he is now ready to concede an
increase of three- members to. cover the
;major -fractions of the States of Florida.
Colorado and North Dakota. If his bill
passes it probably will be with this modi
lioatio'n. ' . ''..;Â¦ -. â¢ "â¢
The opposition is "very aggressive, but
on the surface seems to lack the strength
necessary to carry the Burleigh bill.
There are forces at work, however, by
which the opposition- hope?, through *ttre.
agencies of Senator Quay, Senator Platt
of New York and Senator, I-odge of- Mas
sachusetts to ' swing the delegations of
New York, Pennsylvania and Massachu
setts into line, and if successful' the Hop*
kins bill may suffer defeat. Â¦ -
Crumpacker of Indiana proposes to move
to recommit the bill with instructions to
reduce the representation of the Southern
States, but tnere is no idea that such a
proposition will prevail. -â¢-
After the disposal of the reapportion
ment bill the river and harbor bill will
be taken up. It is expected to consume
two clays. The remainder of the week
will be devoted to appropriation bills. The
District of Columbia bill probably will be
next of the supply bills to be considered.
ARMY BELL SUHE* TO PASS.
Measure Hay'Be Disposed Of During
th'3 Present Week.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â The Senate will
continue to give pracftcally uninterrupted
attention to the army reorganization bill
until that measure shall be disposed of.
That the bill will pass no one doubts, and
the general .opinion is that it will get
through some time during the present
week. Senator Hawlcy, chairman of the
Committee on Military. Affairs, expresses
the opinion that the measure will be in
conference by Wednesday, but other Sen
ators postpone the date somewhat. There
are several committee amendments yet to
be considered, including those relating to
the army canteen and veterinary corps.
It was supposed at one time that the can
teen provision would cause prolonged de
bate, but the best opinion now is that
comparatively little time will be spent on
it. A number of amendments suggested
by individual Senators will be considered
at greater length, and some speeches on
the bill; as a whole, are yet to be made.
The provision of the bill authorizing the
enlistment of Filipinos in the army of the
United States is among the features which
are almost certain to come in for sharp
attack.
With the army bill out of the way the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill will be taken up anil after it
other appropriation hills if any are In
shape to be considered.
The ship subsidy bill will be restored
to the calendar as the regular order of
business when thn army bill is passed, and
it will be pressed . when no appropriation
bills are waiting consideration.
Next Saturday will be larpely devoted to
euloRles upon Vie late Senator .Davis of
Minnesota. . * â¢

Itself, for the rain is still falling, though

parts of the valley show that the late
wetting xias been a thorough one. .Not
for many years has the rainfall for the
early part of the season been so heavy
and so satisfactory. Every shower has
come at the right time and the ground
has received the thorough soaking which
it fo badlv needed. The orchardists and
farmers are in high spirits over the out
look. No irrigation will probably be
needed . this year. While all the streams
are running high, there is no present dan

to begin their plowing earlier than usual.
Merchants anticipate much good from the

Drs. Gardner and Stice gave evidence to
the effect that Lambert was Insane. Some
of the evidence taken was behind closed

would be passed as a sane person, but
the physicians who testified at the trial
say he is not, and they would not dis
charge him as cured.
Alexander McAdie, the forecast official
has a hunch on the storm king's doings
and is correspondingly happy. .Guessing
weather as a rule is a severe strain on
gasoline stove or a can of gasoline. These
charges of arson and murder he thinks
are the result of a family row. The stop

THE Bevere rains of yesterday to
tally flooded Townsend street,
between Seventh and Eighth.
Mrs. Fabian, who owns a shanty
near the tracks of the Southern
Pacific, narrowly escaped drowning, and
was only rescued by Police Officer Harry
O'Day, who had to enlist the services of
several citizens. The aged woman was
eventually conveyed to terra tlrma by a
railroad engine.
The water began to rise about 8 o'clock
in the morning through the sewer pipes
in that locality being too small to drain
such a volume of It. Inch by inch the
flooded district began to Increase in size.
The most exposed spot was the cottage
of Mrs. Fabian. At one time there was
a depth of four feet in her modest domi
cile. The old lady decided that she would
not leave her home until the water had
reached the limit. She made a temporary
landing stage out of her kitchen table.
'Jjtie parlor chairs were also pressed Into
service. . *
About this time Police Officer O'Day de
cided that if the old woman did not come
out of her house that she would soon be
the recipient of floral wreaths made in
designs of broken wheels and gates ajar.
Donning gum boots O'Day waded out to
the house and seizing her bodily carried
her to a railroad engine upon which she
was taken to dry land. The old woman
was frantic that she should be compelled
to leave her house. She became so hysteri
cal that sheÂ» was taken to the" Receiving
Hospital, where she was put to bed and
her clothes dried. She pleaded to be al
lowed to go back home,- but her request
Â¦was. refused, as the police were afraid
that she might wade back to the house
and possibly be arowned.
Mrs. Fabian is a widow and has lived
In the cottage more than thirty years.
Recently the Southern Pacific Company
has disputed her right to the property.
She has a strong sense of protecting her
own rights, and it appears that nobouy
has yet ventured to invade her house and
attempt to eject her. She is the sister
ln-law of George H. Foulks, a lawyer con
nected with the Southern Pacific law de
partment. The aged woman has support
ed herself and only child, a. little girl, by
gathering mushrooms.
During the flood Chief Outside Deputy

prophecy, but McAdie has things down
to where he can put on his overshoes
and every one gets out their umbrellas
and rubbers even though the sun be shin
ing, with the assurance of having use for
them before night. The storm which has
made things so uncomfortable for the
urban citizen and s?o good for the farmer
for the last few days has proved like
modeling wax In Mr. McAdle's prophetic
hands, and there was Joy in the weather
bureau last night when the reports of the
storm that came back, just as the Mills
building prophet said it would, were be
ing received.
The storm started at 5 o'clock yesterday
morning and continued in a steady down
pour until about that hour in the even
ing, with the result that 1.75 inches of
cloud Juice brought the season's rainfall
up to 10.84, which Is thought very credit
able, the record for last season being 13.66.
The rain was at times one of the heaviest
ever known in this city. From 12 m. until
ten minutes after that hour .16 of an inch
fell, making every gutter a miniature tor
rent. In many of the low-lying districts
of the city the water drained from "the
hillside until, in the Mission particularly,
the inhabitants thought of the deluge.
All over the country toward the south
rain was still falling last night, but with
altogether beneficent effects. Hardly
enough has fallen yet in -the Sacramento
Valley to cause much of a rise in the
rivers. At Marysville last night the river
was carrying fourteen flet of water, but
the danger line is nineteen feet, so the
dwellers along its banks need feel no
anxiety. In the Sierra it Is snowing, which
should prove good news to the mining
men. The snowfall la heaviest from the
center of the State to the southern portion
thereof. , Nevada, too. is getting its share
of the general downfall.
The storm which did all this was the
same that played an engagement here in
the middle of the week. Jt was, as Mc-
Adie predicted, forced out to sea by high
pressure, but yesterday it managed to get
ashore again, and now It is going east,
they say at the Weather Bureau. It
wanted to go east before, but high pres
sure over the Rockies prevented it getting
across, and it had perforce to stay on the
coast. Now the high pressure shows signs
of weakening and the storm is hastening
to press 'on Its advantage and get through.
It is not likely, therefore, that there will
be much need for umbrellas, as a parting
sprinkle last night was probably the
storm's farewell. McAdie says, however,
that It may be only au revolr, bo it be
hooves one to watch out for squalls.
To San Luis Obispo fall yesterday's
pluvian. laurels; 4.54 of rain in twenty
four hours fell In that locality, and floods
are general. Whether with any loss of
life or serious damage is not known. In â¢
Red Bluff the lightest rainfall was re
corded, it being .26 of an inch. Sacra
mento and Fresno had .78 of an inch and
.48 of an inch respectively.
A peculiarity of yesterday's storm is
that there was "little or no wind with it.
Late last evening reports .were not yet In
from Washington and Oregon, as they
have^to come by way of Chicago. This
interferes with reliable prophecy, as the
center of theTBtorm lies in those States,
and it Is Impossible to predict accurately
without knowing every phase of the
storm's career. Deputy Prophet Wilson
said last night, however, that the storm
was eastward bound and unless it collides
with some high pressure before It Is well
away, San Francisco has seen the last of
It* ' * '-' - . Â¦
had "slight pains in his bones." This was
regarded as a favorable sign by the phy
sician In charge of the men at the private
Institution where they are now treated.
He said that when the remedy began to
exercise Its Influence upon the system the
patient complained of the pains of which
Beerman spoke. This condition, he said,
had been noted by Dr. Robin and by other
well-known physicians who had made a
study of the treatment.
Beerman said later in the afternoon that
the pain had disappeared and that he
never felt better In his life. He was rest
ing well last right. During the day he
pad been in good spirits and -had eaten
three good meals. Physicians who had
charge of Beerman for three months be
fore the present treatment was begun said
the man s appetite had been very poor. â¢

Local trade presented no new features last week.
Wheat went up and Â«1own with Chicago.* There was
largely increased activity in oil stocks on the Oil Ex
change, with a marked tendency toward higher price3.
Local securities of all descriptions were quiet and
featureless. Farm and industrial staples showed little
charge, and the week passed with no commercial oc
n:rrences worthy of especial mention. The copious
rain came at the right time and did a great deal of
jrood. We are deficient in rainfall thus far this sea
son, but there is still plenty of time to catch up to
the normal. As it is, with occasional rains from now
en. we have received enough to preserve us from a
IKisitive dry year. Farmers, however, report that the
ground is quite dry several feet below the surface,
which is not a desirable condition for fruit trees.
Wall street generally maintained a good tone in the
fare of disturbing events in London, where the great
mining collapse, renewed bad news from South
Africa and the advancing of the discount rate of the
Bark of England from 4 per cent to 5 discomposed
matters generally. The advance in the bank rate was
<!ue to the reduction of the bank's reserve to 27^ per
rent of its liabilities, the lowest point touched in a
generation. Toward the close of the week heavy
â¢Â¦ealizing for London account proved a disquieting
factor, and the last two or three days were distin
guished by irregularity, some lines of stock being
weak and heavy and others firm. Trading on Friday
was the heaviest ever known, amounting to 1,837,000
shares, and there was considerable excitement in the
Northwestern railroads, led by St. Paul.
There was no particular change in the staples. There
was a rise in wheat, accompanied by heavy buying,
but it was soon found that the flurry' was entirely
speculative, and this discovery led to distrust and a
subsequent reaction .'oward lower prices, though the
market did not fall back as low as the starting point.
Wool continued dull, though outside of the United
States the situation is teported stronger. Cotton was
quiet and not materially changed. There was a rise
in cured meats on the Chicago Board of Trade. A
war broke out in ruDber goods and quotations were
cut. The feature of :he iron trade was the increased
movement in steel rails, several large sales, among
lhem 25.000 tons to Chicago, being reported. The
boot and shoe trade was reported in fair condition,
though uneven distribution of orders among the dif
ferent factories was remarked.
r\ CCORDING to the weekly bank clearings busi
/ \ ness was decidedly more active throughout the
* country last week. The gain over the corre
sponding week in 1900 was 29.5 per cent, and, with
the exception of Baltimore, the fourteen largest cities
showed an increase, that at New York being 42.1 per
cent. This latter gain, however, was largely caused
by active speculation in Wall street and the payment
of January dividends, so it hardly shows that amount
of increase in legitimate merchandising. The gain at
Pittsburgh which is genuine, as it represents the con
dition of the iron and steel trades, was 36.9 per cent.
The more commercial cities gained, while the decrease
was generally confined to those cities whose trade is
limited and of a local character. The failures were
266, against 22Q for the corresponding week in 1000.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
All of that is an old story. It is with difficulty that
men absorbed in private business can be induced to
give any considerable portion of their thoughts, time
and energy to public affairs. They desire good-gov
ernment, but they also desire (to" attend to. their own
business. The consequence is ithat municipal politics,
In an address on Saturday night on "The Causes of
Municipal Degeneration" he said: "The prevailing
corrpution in New York exists largely because of your
indifference and mine. The solution of the problem
lies in individual activity and vigilance. I am sorry
for one thing, my friends, and that is that in spite of
the approval with which my remarks in St. Paul's
Chapel seem to have been met at the time, they really,
fell absolutely dead. What have any of you done
along the .line of personal vigilance, in spite of your
evident desire to bring, about changed conditions?
You will never get results until you get up the proper
spirit of sacrifice and vigilance."
BISHOP POTTER of New York, who has taken
upon himself some of the work of municipal re
form in that city, has found, like his predecessors
in the task, that the political evils of a community are
due not so much to the viciousness of a few as to. the
comparative indifference of the people generally. That
truth has been known for a long time, but the Bishop
appears to have been ignorant of it, and he is now
discussing it as if it were an original discovery.

Brooklyn, exclusive of speed premium
and trial expenses, was $4,056,440 D4, and as
the vessel ', was contracted f or : in Febru

for about $3,500,000.. It is quite apparent

WORLD'S NAVAL NEWS
We need not consider at this time what course to
pursue should such a programme be adopted in
Europe. It suffices to know. that ours is the best
market in the world suid that we could easily make
the programme unprofitable to its framers. The one
point in the subject of interest to us is the proof it
afTords of our industrial and commercial supremacy.
We have become the dominant nation of the globe.
Our influence is felt in every market. Europe recog
nizes, our power, and by eagerly discussing how best
to avoid our competition virtually admits that it can
not be met with success in a fair field.
The cbmmercial federation of one or more nations
against others would Jesuit in retaliation, and in the
end the federation would go to pieces. Moreover the
interests of the various European countries are at
present so conflicting that any harmonious pro
gramme of commercial action is hardly possible. The
only thing likely to be accomplished in furtherance of
the scheme is the creation of a commercial sentiment
adverse to the United States and the arrangement of
leciprocity treaties that would place us at a disadvan
tage in the markets of the contracting parties.
WHEN an Austrian statesman some years ago
recommended I he formation of a commercial
union of the principal European countries for
the purpose of guarding their industries against
American competition the proposition was treated as
a question for discussion only. It was not supposed
it would be presented as an issue of practical politics
within the life of this generation. Since then, how
ever, the idea has been strongly supported in several
influential quarters, and it is quite possible something
of the kind may be attempted, though not in the way
originally proposed.

Besides being a distinct triumph of orig
inality Mrs. Jewett's entertainment scored
in favor of Informality. There were no
introductions. Everybody who met under
the hospitable Jewett roof was supposed
to be willing and anxious to know the
others, and so the hostess dispensed with
the uaual "allow me to present," and all
were bidden to shake hands and be socia

.To my mind the smartest thing Mrs.
Jewett did was the dishing up of the lit
erature of to-dayâ the light, frothy, soap
bubbling kind. The character of the end
of the old century reading matter was
told with the aid of dummy-books bound
in sensational colors, and the keynote was
struck with the gauzy bit of tulle fes
tooned around the gay mantle that did
duty for a bookshelf. An egg-beater deft
ly thrust In tho midst of the flimsy rose
colored drapery completed the picture.
Before Mrs. Jewett we all should bo-w

It thus appears the commonwealth of Australia as
organized on New Year's day will, remain without
much in the way of territorial expansion for many
years to come. Moreover, it will not be absolute in
that part of the globe. It will have a rival small in
size but vigorous and ambitious to try conclusions
with it in the far distant years as to which will be the
greater power of the two.
Having this local patriotism and desire for self
government, accompanied by an ambition for colo
nial expansion among the lesser islands of the South
Seas, and for the development of socialistic experi
ments in governmental work, it is not likely
the New Zealanders will ever consent to be
come an adjunct to Australia, From Auck
land to Sydney is a distance of more than
1200 miles, and, though modern steamships have done
much to overcome distance, they have not succeeded
in annihilating so large a distance as that. Conse
quently the New Zealanders may with reason b<*
opposed to intrusting their affairs to a Government so
remote from them and separated by such a vast ex
panse of ocean.
The aspirations of the New Zealanders, however,
have been more potent than their lands or their re
sources in determining them to stay out of the Austra
lian federation. They proudly call their country the
"Latest Britain," and aspire to develop a form of
civilization better than that in any other part of the
world. In no other country* has so much been done
in the way of promoting the general welfare by mean^
of governmental assistance. The Government not
only builds and operates railroads, but it insures prop
erty, lends money, promotes the establishment of
Â¦farms and -factories, and provides pensions for the
aged and the infirm.
These ample lands justify .the New Zealandeis in
believing they can erect a government of their own
capable of attaining high rank among the nations.
They have, moreover, many resources. The climate
is better than that of Australia; they have no great
waste of arid land like the-whole of the central region
of*Australia, and, finally, they have fairly profitable
gold districts and rich stores of coal and iron.
Such an ambition on the part of New 'Zealand is
not unnatural. It is tiue the New Zealand group of
islands is small in comparison with Australia, which
is so large as to be sometimes classed as a continent;
but nevertheless it contains an area of about 100,000
square miles, being larger than : that . of England,
Wales and Scotland, and not far short of being as
large as those countries with Ireland added to them.
Moreover, New Zealand claims dominion over the
Chatham Islands and ihe Auckland Islands, and hopes
to add to them several other groups in her part of
the ocean, so that in connection with her home popu
lation and territory she can have considerable colo
nial extension. â¢
THE AMBITIONS OF NEW ZEALflND.
n USTRALIA began on New Year's day .her
/ \ career as a" fedeial republic with much of grati
fication and something of.di$appointment. The
gratification was due to the achievement at last of a
United Australia, bound to the British empire by ties
so slight as to leave her virtually an independent state.
The disappointment was due to the fact that New
Zealand holds aloof from the federation and evinces
a determination to establish herself in the Southern
Ocean as a rival power. â¢

Chamot, the heroine and good angel of tho
legations during the recent awful times Id
Peking. She got back to San Francisco
just In time for the New Year celebra
tion, and is being- feted by the many
friends who knew and loved her when she
was Lizzie McCarthy. I went up to see
her, and had the good fortune to catch
her and her brave and charming' husband
In the midst of their unpacking. When
you see the contents of those twentyrone
trunks and are allowed to gaze upon tho
many gorgeous tokens with .which the
members of the besieged legations tried
to express their appreciation of the
Chamots you will fully understand what
noble work Mr. and Mrs. Chamot must
have done. \
There are tokens from all the great
diplomats and' from foreign officers who
came to their rescue, and heapB of treas
ures confiscated .by the Europeans when
they overran the heathen temples.
In 'the first place there Is $420,00- repre
senting the monetary rewards of all the
nations whose Ministers the Chamots so
nobly served. There are bags of uncut
rubies and pearls, jeweled hairpins, fans
whose sticks are of carved ivory and set
with precious stones, magnificent em
broidered stuffs, gorgeous vases and bowls
of rarest cloisonne and a hundred and one
other things that only linger In my mem
ory as dazzling and gorgeous.
Li Hung Chang expressed his approval
of the Chamots by making the husband
a mandarin. ' Now, It Is the custom for
every mandarin to be the proud owner of
a yellow satin <irapery, that Is to be used
after he has passed away in draping the
walis of the room in which his body lies
In state. With his gift of knighthood went
the yellow sÂ»atin hanging, and to describe
It I need the flowery phrases of his most
flowery tongue. Other magnificent things
that I remember are a screen of gigantic
proportions and fashioned of carved ivory
and mother-of-pearl, a . priest's robe of
emerald green catin Â¦embroidered In gold
and with large bunches of American
Beauty roses wrought by hand in a fash
ion that makes It almost worthy of na
ture, and a goM head-dress set with mag
nificent gems that had belonged to the
Empress. t
Most prized of all the treasures is an en
ameled medallion of the Pope, sent with
a letter from his Holiness. In which he
Invites the Chamots to come and 'see him.

Then Mr. Mayne passed away, and here
is the clause, in his last will and testa

simple proriiiso he made to his old friend.

Hoffman. This la the story as they

Charles Â» Mayne and Judge Ogden Hoff

cupying the same table. One evening
their talk, so the story runs, drifted to
the comparative degree of happlnesa they

SOCIETY:
ABOUT A MILLIONAIRE AND A BELLE
An opportunity such as this comes rarely to any
legislative body. It is therefore one of which the
fullest use should be made. The responsibility rests
particularly upon the Republican members, for they
control the Legislature and have been entrusted by
the people with the work of the session. From that
responsibility there can be no shirking, and every
Republican should face it with honesty and fidelity.
If that be done California will cease to be a doubtful
State from a political point of view and will take her
rightful place among the States that are surely
Republican. Â»
With such opportunities before them 1 the members
of this Legislature can easily make a record which
will be honorable to themselves and to the State. Th^y
will have none but themselves to blame if they fail
to do so. They meet in what may be called," for Cali
fornia at least, an era of good feeling. The results
of the last elections have been so decisive as to put
an end to the old issues of party controversy, and no
new ones have as yet arisen. The important meas
ures before the ! people now are of a non-partisan
character. The only persons discontented with the
prevailing harmony -ind likely to try to excite dissen
sions are the old bosses and their diminished follow
ing. All other citizens are virtually agreed at this
time concerning the essential elements of every great
issue with which the Legislature is expected to deal,
and the members of the Senate and the Assembly have
only to follow popular guidance in order to achieve
results that will be not only a credit to themselves
but a lasting benefit to the State.
Taking all things into consideration then the peo
ple have a just ground for expecting good work along
?.ll lines of legislative duty, and it is highly gratifying
that it should be so. There are many important is
sues seriously affecting great interests of the State
which should be dealt with this winter. In addition
V< the necessary work of redistricting the State, which
should be done in a fair and impartial manner, and the
passage of the appropriation bills requisite for the
maintenance of the Slate government and its insti
tutions on an economical but not a parsimonious
basis, legislation should be provided to increase the
revenues of the university, to protect the forests and
conserve the flood waters of the State, to establish a
traveling library system, to promote highway im
provement, and finally to furnish a primary law which"
will stand the test of the courts and protect every citi
zen in his rights at primary elections.
There is but one cloud visible upon the prospect at
this time â that caused by the efforts of the old bosses
to gain such control or influence as will enable them
to dictate the arrangement of the Congressional, Sen
atorial and Assembly districts of the State for the next
decade, and possibly to get in a cinch bill or two for
remunerative purposes. That danger, however, has
been foreseen from the start, and there is reason to
believe it has been effectually guarded against. At
any rate it is the sole danger now in sight; and, more
over, is less dangerous than it has been at any session
of the Legislature for many a year past.
OF the Legislature this winter the people of Cali
fornia have a right to expect much. Every
circumstance of the session is propitious to
good work. There is no Senatorial contest to create
factions and to take up the time of the members.
Neither is there any partisan issue at stake which
divides the people and which might give rise to pro
longed discussions and wrangles in either house.
Finally the railroad, which for so many years has been
a disturbing factor in State politics and the author of
so much evil at Sacramento, is now under new man
agement and seemingly is out of politics. Thus the
session is left free for the performance of genuine
legislative work in the interests of the people and for
the public welfare.
A LEGISLATIVE OPPORTUNITY.
- Fortunately there are many signs* of a coming
change in that temper of the American people.- The
movements now going on all over the country for
better municipal administration are evidences that the
people have learned the lessons taught by bad gove-n
ment and are trying to profit by them. In too many
cases a mistake is made in trying to provide a remedy
by law instead of by patriotic attention to public duty.
Experience will soon prove fhe futility of such plans,
and in the end we, shall have that resolute public
opinion and incessant popular vigilance which are
needed to incite strong officials and compel weak
ones to perform their duties with honesty and zeal.
Our system of government does not provide effec
tive administration in any branch of public service,
but it does most effectively provide for the education
of the people. It teaches lessons with a clearness that
cannot be mistaken, and makes "those lessons so
costly that eYeif the richest citizens are forced to
give heed to them. .Every intelligent man in an
American city knows the cause of the evijs in his com
munity, and he knows also the price he will haye to
pay to get rid of them. He approves of such speeches
as Bishop Potter has been making, but' he ; does not
tct upon them. It seems ! the average good
citizen has come to the conclusion 'that for the pres
ent at least good government requires too much good
work that could be better employed in private busi
ness, and he acts accordingly. .
and Indeed a large part of State and Federal politics,*
passes into the hands of professional politicians. Those
who adopt , public business as a trade do so in the
main for the purpose of making a living by it, and, as
i: happens, most of them are unscrupulous as to tho
means by which the money is ma.dei' ; â¢

In a quaint speech in good keeping with
his assumed character Mr. Golden said
that he and his company were snowbound
for four days on their way here from Ore
gon; that they had only arrived just be
fore the curtain rang up, and that In con
sequence cf the fatigue of the journey
the leading lady, Mrs. Golden, was un
able to appear and for the present was at
the Valdeck Hospital. Mr. Golden ac
cordingly asked that the audience should"
reserve judgment of the piny until fur- |
their hearing, "though, for his part, he '
thought it a purty good show just as it
stood'." with which sentiment the audi
ence showed its pympathy and agreement
in the usual fashion.
"Old Jc-d Prouty" Is quite the usual sort
of play of the "Old Homestead" kind. The
incidents differ, but the spirit accords.
The kindly, shrewd old country innkeeper,
Jed Prouty. which Mr. Golden plays wHh
an admirable, quaint humor and finish, is
a familiar character, but the ren
dering is clever enough to carry a much
more threadbare conception. The long
lost child is there, the mortgage, the
countryman in town and the rest of it,
but with the familiar materials Mr.
Golden has woven a wholesome, humor
ous and bright little pastoral, which every
one will enjoy.
Robert Craig shows veritable genius as
the town crier. Zach WIlcox. As good
work as Is done in the play Is here done.
Melville Stanley Collins? as Beacon Hill,

Joseph Preston Kills Him
self fecause His Wife
Upbraids Him.
It was learned last night that Preston
had boen paid h!s salary by the telephone
company on Saturday afternoon, and
when his body was searched by the dep
uty coroners no money was found in the
pockets. The body was removed to the
Monrue and an autopsy and Inquest will
be held to-day.
Dr. \V. D. Clark of 2554 California Ftreet
wrj notified and took charge of affairs.
He Is an o!1 ?ri*n<J of Mrs. Preston, and
the 'lector end hi* wife cared for the two
children of the dead man. Mr and Mrs.
TVatson. who live at 2C27 California street,
took Mrs. Preston to their home, where
th^ unfortunate woman was hysterical
for many hours, being unable to give any
information as to her husband's death.
According to the Rtatements made by Mrs
Pret=ion to Or. Clark before she became
hvptericaJ. her husbrna deliberately eaid
that he would end his life. On New
Year's eve Mrs. Preston and her children
took refuge In Dr. Clark's house to es
cape the fury of her hu6band, who In a
rage threatened to kill niÂ» wife
with a razor.
Qulrkly realizing that something terrible
had happened, Mrs. Preston broke open
the door and was overpowered by the
rijph of fra.* ir.to the hallway. She eaw
hf-r husband lying on the floor, and with
a. ecream thÂ« te Trifled woman ran Into the
Ftrr<t calling: for help. Dr. Shumate was
rjuirkly summoned and on arriving at th<Â»
house he found that Preston waa dead.-
The doctor at or.ee called Police Officer
GUI, who ran *o the houee and entered the
room where Preston was cold In death.
The officer turned off the gas. although
r>r. Bhumate claimed that he did this
f. hen he first went lntÂ« the room to view
the bodv.
On reaching tTrn" Preston was upbraid
ed by his w'fÂ«. arid he threatened to kill
himself. He left h!s wife and children '.n
the upppr part of the house and went Into
the front parlor, on the lower floor. His
Â¦wife was not roncernod at not peeing her
husband, thinking that he was asleep.
Abont 2 p. m. Mr?. Preston noticed the
o<3nr of gras, an-J started to find the causÂ«.
Hhe traced the pas odor to the front par
kir and found Â»b<> door locked.
Preston was S5 years old and waÂ« a
married man. having two children, a girl
* )reÂ«n old and a boy of 5 years.
For some time past Preston had been
drinking heavily, and his conduct was the
of frequent quarrels with his wife.
Yesterday morning Preston returned to
Ms home at 7 o'clock, being under the
Influence of liquor. He rode out on car 20
of the California Ftreet line and had some
vordfl with Conductor Larabi*Â». as the Iat
ter ir>fils=ted that J'reston should ride ln-
Kide the <*ar.
Jipeph Preston, a bookkeeper for the
telephone company, committed suicide
J"Â«eterday morning at his residence, 5329
California street, by turning on the gas
and inhaling the deadly carbon monoxide
vapor.
PITIFUL DEATH
OF CHILD-WIFE
IN THIS CITY
Mysterious Circumstances in
thi Death of Mrs. &. .
W. Spooner.
Dr. Kuhlman Kef uses to Sign Certi
ficate and Husband Says He
Does Not Care What Be
comes of Body.
In the meanwhile those who knew the
child-wife in life are trying to save her
frail body from the potter's field or the
dissecting table.
An autopsy on the body of Mrs. Spoon
er, performed hv Dr. Leland last night.'
disclosed that death was due to acute
double lobar pneumon.a and acute peri
carditis. The Inquest - will be held to
day. * /Â¦ - ' '
Dr. Kuhlman. . who figures as the last
attending physician of the child-wife, by
his res-pOnses to queries Indicated his In
tention of doing or saying something that
would cast discredit on the management
of the City and County Hospital, or else
again encountering the process of con
tempt of the Coroner, for which once be
foro he suffered Imprisonment. Â¦
"Her father gave his consent to the
marriage." he answered to repeated
queries. 'I lived In the house with him
and married the girl with his consent. I
was past 40 when I married her, and she
was, T guess, past 13. I ain't got to say
no more and I ain't going to the Morgue
to Â«ee her."
While Spooner admits to being past 40
years of age. he is sold to be about 55
years old. He Is a tall, rawboned man.
fullv six feet in height, with heavy,
sunken jaws and eyes and prominent
chpek bones. His demeanor be^noke an
entire indifference to his child-wife's fate.
Tn a dingy room In the roar of Mrs. TTo
gan's lodging hoiis*Â» the elderly husband
of thf unfortunate child-wife sat prepar
ing hlsÂ« evening meal.
"To h with her." was his response to
a question as to what he proposed to do.
"I ain't Roing to talk about her. She left
me and stole my $205. I didn't have no
use for her, anyhow. She left and I let
her go."
Spooner to all questions about hi* ante
cedents pave equivocal and surly an
swers. He said he worked at anything
that came along: his last place nf em
nloymont beinc the Pacific Tank Works,
lie "did any old thin? there." he said.
Mrs. Jansen called during the day at the
several places where Mrs. Spooner or
Corey Bailey raided and anxiously In
quired what disposition had been made of
her f'ffcels and what arrangements would
be made for. her funeral.
"Under the provisions of the law." said
Dr. Kuhlman, "I must decline to speak of
the case. The law protects me and I
don't propose to say anything. I may not
testify at the Coroner's Inquest. I don't
have 'to if I don't want to. I don't want
to say anything about the way the woman
was treated at the City and County Hos
pital. She was neglected and 111 treated,
and somebody will have to suffer. ' t
won't tPlI who because I don't have to."
"We i took the woman In out of pure
charit>," said Jansen yesterday after
noon. "My . wife was attracted to her
while rvisiting a friend. In the same ward
and we brought her over here. My wife
watched by her bedside night and day
until ishe died and closed her eves in
death. We would bury her If we could,
but I thought to appeal to the papers for
assistanca."
Then Dr. Kuhlman refused to sign ner
certificate of death, notified the health
ofiico and the Coroner and on investiga
tion was commenced. The Board of
Health postrd a diphtheria notice on the
door, fumipalfd the house, and the body
of the child- wife was taken to the Morgue.
Finally she was taken ill with rheuma
tism and found a shelter about a month
or two ago at 1119Â»Â£ Howard street. But
the seeda of disease were in her young
bones, and helpless and suffering in her
infirmity she was sent at. the suggestion
of Dr. Rosenthal to the City and County
Hospital. Her case was diagnosed as
rheumatism and pneumonia and she was
placed in. one of the wards.
Directly across the street from the en
trance to the city's hospital reside T. C.
Jansen. an employe of the Market-street
Hallway Company, and his wife. The lat
ter visited a friend in the hospital who
was in the same ward with the sick glrl
wlfe. Although in poor circumstances,
the Jansens say that they were moved by
the young woman's pitiful tale and caused
her removal to their home some days be
fore she died. They summoned their fam
ily physician, Dr. Charles G. Kuhlman,
and he treated her at the Jansens' ex
pense until she died.
Away back in the hills of Vermont on
June 3, lt>97, George W. Spooner, who con
fesses to being at least 44 years of age,
was lr.arrleo m Higngata, Franklin Coun
ty, Vt., to Corey L. Bailey, then scarcely
la years of age, by Rev. H. W.Worthern,
the wife of the latter being the only wit
ness to the ceremony. The girl bride got
a flower-embossed certificate of marriage,
setting forth these facts.
A journey was then undertaken to the
Paclttc Coast, the bride of 13 in her short
skirts and the awkward husband, old
enough to be her father at least, attract
ing unusual attention along the long
route. At various points attempts were
made to stop and separate the ill assorted
couple, but armed with that Vermont
minister's certificate they were enabled
to finally land in San Francisco. â¢
Shortly after â¢ arrival they secured a
room in the rear of the upper floor of a.
lodging house at 841A Howard street, kept
by Mrs. Hogan, and there they slept and
ate and suffered. The difference In age
between the two, the unsatisfactory and
unsanitary conditions* under which they
lived, soon made the child-wife sick. She
applied to Mrs. Hogan for advice and
comfort and was taken to the medical col
lego at 814 Howard street; Where -as a
clinical patient she came under the min
istrations of Dr. C. H. Rosenthal. The
latter took great interest in her welfare
and secured her a position In a family,
where she would be free from the annoy
ances caused by her husband's conduct.
From one place to another she went,
ever annoyed by Spooner, and finally she
was forced to leave him. He accused her
of stealing from him some $200 which the
woman claimed as her own.
The body of a child-wife lays on a slab
at the Morgue. Her span at life was less
than eighteen years, yet she became a
bride over three years and a half ago.
Her aged husband sits sullen and' Indif
ferent In his room in a Howard-street
lodging house, willing that her frail body
should be given over to a medical college
or burled In the potter's field. .The attend
ing physician, who for reasons of his own
declines to certify to the cause of the
child-wife's death, adds more mystery to
the circumstances surrounding the pass-
Ing of Mrs. George \V. Bpooner, formerly
Corey L. Bailey.

heavily and soon the steering gear was

Resumed.
6CRANTON. Pa., Jan. 6. â The 800 em
ployes of the Mount Pleasant colliery of
the Elk Hill Coal and Iron Company are
again on a strike, the third time in a year.
They decided to strike Saturday night
because the superintendent refused to
give a driver boy the rato of wages the
boy claimed he was entitled to. The com
pany anticipated the strike by posting a
notice that the colliery from this date
would be shut down.
The men are threatening to call out the
7000 employes of the twelve collieries of
the Elk Hill Company if the lockout Is
persisted' In at the Mount Pleasant mine.
There Is some danger of the renewal of
the street car strike. The bar men re

by the company and sent back an alterna

Crack English Jockey, Sammy Loates,
Beaches New York En Boute to
San Francisco.
NEW YORK. Jan. 6.â Samuel Loates.
whose record on the English turf last year
was second only to Lester Relff, the
American Jockey, arrived In New York to
day. He will start for the West in a week
or ten days and San Francisco 1 Is his
destination. In California he will attend
the races at Oakland and Tanf oran and
visit some of the noted, breeding estab
lishments on the Pacific Coast. Return-
Ing he will visit Southern California, New
Orleans and Florida, and will sail for
home about March 1.
-â¢ "If Sloan assented to Mr. Gardner's
proposition to lay him Â£5000 to nothing,
the Jockey Club probably considered that
a violation of the rules, although he didn't
get the money. It looks to me as if he was
let off easily with a view of Klvinsr a
chance to ride in other countries. He will
be foolish if he seeks a license In England
next year,. for the Jockey Club never tells
what It has against anybody and never
retracts, and he will surely be turned
down.*" -:.. â¢Â¦.-Â¦Â¦ -vS7.
JEFF STABTS TRAINING.
To-Day Begins His First Work for

NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â James J. Jeffries
left for Asbury Park, N. J., to-night, and
to-morrow he will take his first exercises
for his championship battle with Gus
Ruhlin, which takes place in Cincinnati
on February 15.
The champion arrived from Philadelphia
early to-day, where he closed his theatil
cal season on Saturday night. He met h's
old manager and trainer, Billy Delaney,
and both proceeded to Asbury Park.
* Jeffries was looking In the best of shape
and said he was In fine. condition. He
said: "I will go into training to-morrow
to do my first work for the big fight. I
feel fine now, and. barring accidents, 1
expect to be in fine shape when I meet
Ruhlin. As regards the result of this bat
tle, there is no doubt in my mind but that
I will still be the champion after Febru
ary 15." i

animate targets with a general average of
255 points. J. S. Fanning, the California
crack shooter, has the greatest number of
one-day first average wins; also the great
est number of general first average wins.
Yet he is In second position for the year
by figuring second, third and fourth aver
age wins in the point of ratio.
Fanning made a^new world's record on

In two days, but was continuous.
SAN DIEGO WINS
FAST BALL GAME
Taylor's Pitching Was a
Puzzle That Was Hard*
to Solve.
I>og^' Deviereaux Was

Bowman of the Winning Team Bats
Out a Homo Bun When "Bed
Bowman. Drennan and Arrellanea of the
Oakland team are with the San Diego
The leaden of the league are the Levya
of Los Angeles, but cranks here believe
that the team Is topheavy with too much
catching and pitching talent to stay well.
With Dungan, Chance Lohxnan, Peters
and Carter as catchers and Iburgr, Fitz
patrlck and Mosklman as pitchers It Is
thought the team has fully too much of
that class.
Charley Doyl# of the Sacramento team
has anlvefl in San Diego to play the reat
of the winter as change pitcher. He in
carrying a Plttsburg contract around with
him and has not yet decided whether to
put his name on it or not. With' Doyie
San Diego has four good men in the box
âTaylor, Donlin. Doyle and Devereaux.
The last named has been doing good work
in the box, but is needed at short.
Jimmie Whalen. who was compelled to
quit work for Stockton In the middle of
last season on account of his health, has
asked for and been granted his release
from the San Bernardino team because
he Is threatened with a return of the
trouble. He has been winning games for
San Bernardino and will be missed in the
box.
In Taylor the Oaklands will get a man
who with a good backstop can win his
game almost alone. A week ago at San
Bernardino, with Buch men In the Â¦oppos
ing team as Krug and Brockhoff of San
Francisco, Hutchlnson, Francks and Man
gerlna of Oakland. Kelly of Sacramento
and Whalen and McCarthy of Stockton,
he was faced by only twenty-eight men
and twenty-seven of them went out. Xot
a man was walked, eix were struck out
and the rest ait 10 the Infield or up In
the air. Taylor nim&elf had seven fielding
chances in the fame and accepted them
all.
Mike Donlin. who has been playing -with
St. Louts for a year and a half, is also
likely to stay on the coast. He Is now
playing first for San Diego and taking a
chance now and then In the box or at
short. He was the star twirler of the
California League two years ago after
Jay Hughes had gone East, and that Is
what carried him back there, but he has
been playing in the field or at first for
St. Louis. He can undoubtedly commin.l
good money In the East, but is said to be
considering an. offer to stay out West
with Sacramento.
The Southern California Winter Base
ball Litague is attracting consider
ably more attention than It did
a month agxÂ», when the first games
were played, and it now seems that the
southern league will in a way help the
Northern California League for next sum
mer. "Dumby" Taylor, the crack pitcher
of the New York Giants, who came to San
Diego for the winter with no thought of a
longer etay, has been captured by Cal
12wipg to play with the Oaklands next
cummer. Taylor waa change pitcher for
tue New York team, but he was up with
the rest in the number of games
won in comparison with the number
pitched. He came to California
to keep in training for next year,
and though the Southern California
League does not pay anything like tha
salaries of Eastern leagues, nor of the
Northern California League, Taylor has
found the, trip a money-maker and par
ticularly a money-saver, for with two af
ternoons In the ball game he is able to
put in five days a week at his trade, that
of printer, and comes out at the end of
each seven days a long distance to the
good.
Taylor likes California. He does not
claim that it is improving either bis hear
ing or his voice, but he likes the climate,
and since Manager Ewing has given him
a chance to stay with it he is going to
stay. It is said that the Oakland man's
offer was 5290 a month, which with a
month longer season and less games a
week. Is likely to bring the total up to
anything that the National League will
offer.

SHOOTERS KNIGHTED AND CROWNED
ON THE RANGES AT SAN RAFAEL
ThÂ« Twentieth Century Club has begun
the fistic business with a rash, that is,
the preliminary part of it-matchmaking
and purse fixing and all that. From New
Orleans and New York dispatches come In
hot succession that top-notch heavy
weights are matched and that Terry Mc-
Govern, greatest smallest ' man of them
all, is pledged to fight here In San Fran
cisco and under the auspices of the Twen
tieth Century Club. ;
The matching of Sbarkey and - McCoy,
which was published In Sunday's Call, la
a fact, the Twentieth Century Club man
agement declares. John Gleason, on* of
the members of this prize-fight organiza
tion, received Information on Friday last
from Jim Kennedy, official matchmaker
of the club, that he would match Bharkey
with either McCoy or iiaher within a few
days. The club, although It has not
beard officially from Kennedy, is con
vinced that Sharkey and McCoy have
been brought together for a fight In this
city on February 28, the date set for the
introduction of the new club's fight ven
tures before a San Francisco public Both
fighters are expected to leave the East
for training quarters within a few weeks.
The McGovern matter is in rather an
uncertain state. No man in his own class
has yet been found for lightning Terry,
but the Twentieth Century Club claims
to have a pledge for a fight In this city
in April or May of the present year.
.. Charlie "White will come from New Tork
as one of the official referees of the club.
Jack Welch has also been engaged In this
capacity.

tween the two top-notchers.
When the pair left the slips tha crowd
had worked its way to the rail to get a
full view of the dogs in their work. The
utmost quiet prevailed and even to the
employes of the park the course
held the complete attention of
all. A cheer went up when
Curtis' do? took the turn near the stand.
The crowd overlooked the fact, however,
that Geary's dog had been handicapped
by a bad start and again that Beacon waa
favored by the hare. Palo Alto soon
convinced them that he was In the game
to stay, and, despite his many perform
ances in which he would lay off. It waa
not in him to hesitate on this occasion.
With a determined effort he got In pos
session and outworked Beacon In the
cleverest fashion, going to his task with
a dash and vigor that waa surprising-.
Never once would he be denied and It
seemed that he had reserved his quick
and cunning to display it against Beacon
In this particular course. Palo Alto ended
one of the most Interesting exhibitions
seen at the park by scoring the kill near
the slips.

TURF CONGRESS
WILL DISAPPEAR
In Its Place Will Rise a
New and Powerful
Organization.
E*sults of the Porthcomlng Mat
ing to Be Held in Chicago
Will Startle th* Bac
\ Ing "World.
From recenst Eastern advices received
It la prophesied that the forthcoming
meeting to be held by the American Turf
Congress at the "Wellington Hotel. Chi
cago, on %Y>dneeday. January 16. is to be
an exceedingly warm one. The forecaster
â¢ xrho transmits the Intelligence likewise
cays it will result in a complete dissolu
â¢ tion of the congress. This is startling
news to the turf world, for the American
Turf Congress was considered well nigh
Impervious to the assaults of time and its
enemies.
According to the very latest advices the
American Turf Congress will become a
thing of the past, but in its 6tead will rise
a netv organization, more powerful in its
eway and more dictatorial in its policy.
The new association, whose name Is yet a
matter of conjecture, Â¦will be represented
&t the commencement by probably seven
different Jockey clubs, among the cities
represented being Memphis, Louisville,
Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.
The letter states that Lansing Misner. one
of the stewards of the San Francisco
Jockey Club, is now in Chicago and will
represent Tar.foran Park at the coming
meeting. Indeed, it Is said that the San
Mateo club has been adjudged guilty of
flirting with the Chicago racing associa
tions In their efforts to smother the
emaller Southern racing centers.
Reviewing the ruffled turf horizon, the
rew organization, it is caid. will be most
exacting in its demands. Every club or
racing association becoming a member
Trtll receive a license, and dates will be
Bet for all tracks In the West and south
of the Mason and Dixon line. Dates will
fce allotted to tracks not members of the
new cor.grees, and unless these dates are
lived up to the tracks in question will be
outlawed. This is a very arbitrary stand,
but weak as the present Turf Congress
is la regard to rules and regulations, the
sew one is to be as solid and unwieldlng
as the rock of Gibraltar.
This, of course, will place the Califor
nia Jockey Club and the San Francisco
Jockey Club in a very peculiar position.
They must either accept the dates as
signed or become outlawed. The opinion
generally p're vails that if there are to be
two great racing associations there should
be three. The climatic conditions of Cali
fornia are entirely different from the
Bouth end Middle West, the people and
the customs are different, and there Is no
valid reason why this State should bÂ« dic
tated to by a body of turfmen unfamiliar
â¢with our ways and more than 2000 miles
nway." â¢,
A*t the meeting to bo held at Chicago on
January 16 the Question will arise as to
what disposition is to be made of the $40,
000 or 550,000 In the American Turf Con
gress fund. In all likelihood It will be
distributed among the different associa
tions now members of the congress.

LONDON. Jan. 7.â This morning's news i
from Cape. Town is again unsatisfactory.
Martial law has been proclaimed at
Malmesbury, and would have -been pro
claimed in other districts but that tho
Cabinet meeting called Saturday was un
able to agree as to its advisability.
The vagueness of tho Information con
cerning ; the movementB and position of

the colonists, and Cape Town calls loudly
for strong reinforcements from England,
on the ground that the greater part of.
Lord Kitchener's available force is em

munication and the Rand mines, the lat

miles. 1 â¢>.-;;
It is asserted by one Cape Town corre
spondent that unless the forces in Capo
Colony are Increased a most, undesirable
state of affairs may result, as the suc

slight, might be a signal for a putch ris
ing As it Is, many British residents have
had to leave the Dutch villages near Cape
Town, their lives being unbearable. .
According to a native report a hundred
men either Boers -or local farmers, have
just passed through the Clan William dis
trict In* the direction of Malmesburg.
The Cape Town^coirespondent of , the
Daily Mail, who calls for - 40,000 fresa
troops, says: "Prominent Afrikander
loyalists 'declare that the rebellious col

ency to ke^p children as long as the app'ropria
tion Is kept up. , There are very grave diffi
culties'Involved and the whole trend of the
situation seems to favor getting children Into
family homes early. Here in California you
must seriously consider the trend of opinion
and thought upon this subject.
In this connection I was much interested In
the work of Father Crowley of the Youths*
Directory of San Â¦ Francisco, which handles
only Catholic children. His house accommo
dates 150 children. Last year he handled 683.
Ot these 200 went back to their parents and
more than 400 were sent out to homes, mostly
to farm 'homes In this State. He had $20,000

OAKLAND. Jan. 7.â "Child-Saving and
the Care of Dependent Children" was the
general theme of discussion at the special
sessions this afternoon and evening of the
California State Conference of Charities
and Correction. The sudden and unex
pected call East of Dr. Hastings H- Hart
made necessary his last appearances to
day before the conference. The eminent
philanthropist devoted the afternoon to an
address upon general phases of the sub
ject and during the evening session went
into much detail, illustrating his talk with
a wide selection of ptereoptlcon views of
institutions and of the various forms of
work in the department of child studv.
Dr. Hart declared the system of the
State subsidy of private .institutions for
child care was not in line with the best
thought and urged a careful investigation
of the subject.
Dr. Mary Roberts Smith of Stanford
University presided at the afternoon ses
sion. In introducine Dr. Hart Dr. Smith
referred to the vast Importance of child
paving work and the need of an Intelligent
direction concerning methods.
Dr. Hart spoke of the absence of legis
lation ln his own State of Illinois until
two years ago upon the care of dependent
and abandoned children. He condemned
the professional boarding houses for chil-

The first section continues In force all

Section two commits the administration
of the Chinese exclusion laws to the Bu

Section three provides for an appeal to

Government, as well as on the part of
Chinese persons. â¢
The first six sections are devoted to tho
trial of Chinese persons accused of belntr
unlawfully in this country, while the sub
sequent sections provide for the procedu-o
ln the matter of Chinese exclusion.
Section 7 gives the Commissioner of Im
migration jurisdiction - to Â¦ determine \ the
right of a Chinese person 'Â¦ to i land, and if
that right is based. on citizenship the al

rot have State aid. Father Crowley does not
fellow In the line of most Roman Catholic In
stitutions ln the matter of service. He hires
all of his help and pays good salaries. Most
of. them depend upon the freely given assist
ance of brothers or of platers of the religious
orders, who receive little more than their
beard and clothing. His argument against a
public grant is that people would not be bo
much Interested in the institution If. it were
Fjbsldlzed and he could not get private as
sistance so readily. With a large number of
people the question arises whether It Is .wlsÂ»
to put our hands In the public treasury. This
demands serious Investigation. Our Institu
tion ln Chicago receives $5000 a year and ws
will undoubtedly give that up.
Tho care of the dependent, abandoned and
neglected child Is one vulnerable point of at
tack upon the Influences that foster pauperism,
vice and crime. It is a sacred work and there
Is a special responsibility upon you, because
your methods of public grants to private In

The theater-goer of the nineteenth cen
tury would find it an easy thing to under
stand the popularity of the comedy called
"Gl" Ingannati," over whose situations
and incidents the theater-goer of old Ven
ice heartily laughed in 1537. The story
that makes the play of "Twelfth Night,
or What You Will," enjoyed widespread
fame in its day. Both Bandello and Cln
thlo selected parts of It for the amuse
ment of their Italian readers, and when
their novels attracted the attention of
foreign readers the stories became great
favoriteo with the English novelists and
playwrights. It was not many years
soon after 1580â before the English story
tellers, such as Barnabe Riche and
Emanuel Forde, were rehearsing the same
incidents for the delectation of their Eng
lish readers. It Is not surprising, then, that
this very popular and entertaining Italian
tale should have become one of Shakes
peare's most pleasing comedies. The pro
tean forms, however, through which this
tale passed, from one story-teller to an
other, baffled the attempts of the re
searcher to discover the play's true origin.
If you compare this play with "The
Comedy of Errors" and "The Two Gentle
men of Verona" you will find a great sim
ilarity In the situations and Incidents, at
times, too, in the characters. Here, for
example, yoM will note the confusion of
identity in the role of Viola and Sebastian
the story of the shipwreck, the disguise of
Viola as a page and her'offlce as messen
ger from her own lover to her own rival,
and numerous other slight shades of re
semblance. Yet there is fascination, a
satisfying Joy to be found in the stage
production of "Twelfth Night," that can
be found again In very few of Shakes
peare's comedies. "As You Like It" seems
to be its rival in the theatrical business of
our day. Wherein lies the fascination?
Up to this period in the history of Shakes
pearean development, if we were able to
trace the methods used by the dramatist,
his choice of scenes, situations, intrigues,
episodes, his knowledge of the effective,
be it in language, action or any other
property known as stage business, we
might gain some Idea of the advancement
of the artist along the lines of his dramat
ic art. It is In the variety, the movement
and the brilliancy of the wit, the force and
clearness of characterization, the har
monious union of the many dramatic ele
ments, named and unnamed, that the de
velopment of the dramatist a work must,
be studied.
By concentratlnar oar attention on some
special part of the play we can gain a
better knowledge of the wonderful work
manship of its author. Let Malvolio be
the special part. The old theater-goers
of 1640 found their greatest pleasure in
Malvolio, and it was he that drew the
crowded houses to "cockpit, galleries and
boxes." The episode of Malvolio, along
with Sir Toby and Sir Andrew, seems to
be original with Shakespeare. The char
acter of Malvolio Is only Italian in name.
It is again one of those examples of
Shakespeare's master feat of welding to
gether the romantic tales of Italy and the
contemporary llfÂ© of bis own English peo
ple.
Criticism has debated and stormed
about the character of Malvolio. Some
thing of a controversy has raged about
him. Lamb writes that up to this time
the traditions of the stage made the char
acter of Malvolio decidedly ludicrous. On
the other hand, there Is a kind of criti
cism that seeks to bring tears to the
reader's eyes when he contemplates the
melancholic dumps and the heartless
treatment with which the lovesick hero
Is overwhelmed. The Daly presentation
of "Twelfth Night" a few years since sat
isfactorily combined the two sides of
"Malvollo's character, allowing the spec
tators to respect the man In his humors
and simultaneously to enjoy the antics
played upon him by Sir Toby and Maria.
But this is the error of the world. To the
world a man may be either a fool or a
knave, while to his creator he Is a harm
less creature with a few foibles. A cre
ative genius, like a Shakespeare or a
Chaucer, never made a character so black
or so blank that there was not room for
a shade of neutral tint, not to speak of
patches of purple. Those creative geni
uses had sympathy with their fellows and
never forgot to employ it in their cre
ations.
The stage has reason to dislike Puritan
ism; hence the ludicrous turn given to the
character of Malvolio. The stage haa
made a fool of him. Malvolio has the
unique position of being the only speci
men of a Puritan satirized by Shake
speare. Here is an opportunity for us de
scendants of Puritan England to see how
sympathetically the artist sketched our
ancestor. Whatever ,may be the purpose
of his wit and humor, however offensive
may have been the Puritanic attitude
toward Shakespeare's own profession, af
fecting perhaps his person and pocket
book, yet the writer did not use his power
to destroy the victim with ridicule, to
heap upon him all the palpable vices and
weaknesses of his class. The playwright
continues to be poetA keeping gayety of
heart himself while treating the specta
tors with the harmlessness of pure fun.
Malvolio is not painted as a repulsive
hypocrite. It would be well to compare
him in this respect with Scott's portrayal
of Puritanism in the figure of Tomkins.
Scott wrecks his creature on the rock of
hypocrisy, making of him a villain, while
Shakespeare makes vanity, self love, the
cause of Malvolio's downfall. Do not
imagine for a, moment then, that Shake
speare is scourging Puritanism under the
mask of Malvolio. His satiric mood is
that of the artist, more subtle, not that
of the hating opponent, full of vengeance.
It is not as Shakespeare's mouthpiece
that Sir Andrew says he desires to "beat
Malvolio like a dog" for being a Puritan.
Malvollo's character, to view it from
another standpoint, is a somewhat tradi
tional one on the English stage. Vanity,
self-love, pomposity, have been human
weaknesses for many eons. Our hero of
first English comedy had a large share of
these foibles â Ralph Roister I>olster â a>id
these foibles caused him to miscalculate)
his power over the hearts of womankind
and slip from the pinnacle of his self
sufficiency. Lyly's Sir Topha3. in "Endym
ion,"has many of the symptoms of Mal
volloâin their first stage, however. Lovo
has "milked his thoughts," and though he
does not don yellow stockings and cros3
garters, yet he lays aside the implements
of warfare and struggles with the cut of
his beard. Sir Tophas is not troubled
about the cakes and the ale. Thus there
Is a whole line of potential Malvollos of
the earlier English sttge, as we all know,
on every national stage. It la as if Shakes
peare^ again completed the embryonic
character sketches of his predecessors,
what Is distinctly true In Malvolio can
only be understood by a historical study
of much that has been achieved by the
dramatists of earlier times. It Is the ln
fusion of new life and meaning Into tho
old forms that makes Shakespeare's mas-
U;rcra t- o. F. McCLCMPHA.
University of Minnesota,
Shakespeare s comedies are strangely
lacking In burlesque and farcical ele
ments, such as abound In the light drama
of the present times. The comedy slnco
Shakespeare's day has evolved itself into
several distinct types, but In none of these
should we expect to find much pathos or
sublime poetry now. Shakespeare, had
the knack of keeping the general tenden
cy and meaning of a play comedlal whlla
making it mainly In details noble and up
lifting. Of all the dramas thus con
structed "Twelfth Night" may be held
easily the chief.
, â¢ Shakespeare seems to have tired of lay-
Ing his scenes In Italy, though he has no
where else greater need of an Italian
heroine and hero. Only in Italy was to
be found such refinement, such culture
as could furnish a Viola. Moreover, If the
play is to have a Viola there must be an
Orslno, whp is In reality but another
Romeo. Tha principal features of the pio*
are' borrowed from the Italian drama of
â¢â¢G1*. Ingannati" ("The Cheated"). Leila
the heroine of that play, is carried off
from Rome upon Its capture by the con
stable of Bourbon In 1527 to Modena,
which chances to be the city In which
Flamineo, the -hero. lives. Leila has been
beloved by Flamineo In former years, but
for some time the lovers have been sep
arated, and she Is now forgotten. Â¦ Leila
finds out. on reaching Modena. that th>Â»
hero. . to .whom she haa remained
faithful, is ; paying court to Isabella, a
rich lady or.' that city. Leila disguises
herself as a page, enters the service of
Flamineo. and la soon sent by him " to
woo Isabella in his stead. Isabella falls
In love with his messenger, but rejects
him. Later Ferttlo, Leiia's brother, from
whom she has been parted since the sack-
Ing of their town, reaches Modena and is
several time* mistaken for his sister. In
adopting this plot Shakespeare puts the
sea bstween .his heroine and hero, and
uses a shipwreck as a means of separat
ing the heroine and hÂ«r brother. Viola
Rives the name of her city as Messallne,
which sounds like tha echo of Messina.
nnd Illyrla, Orsino's duchy, la surely
within the zone of Italian 1 speech and
manners. Of other characters in tha
play. Sir Andrew and Matvollo. and per
haps Olivia, seem English.
It is clear that Viola la in love with the
Duke beforehand, and comes to Illyrla
with set purpofc* (cf. I.. 11.. 41-44. 62-65) to
win him back. As has just been said, the
Duke seems another Romeo, otherwise It
would be out of keeping^ that he should
be wooed. He is in love 'with love, with
his own Ideals, as Romeo was. Rome*
worshiped afar off, with no least desire to
approach, or woo, in presence, till Juliet la <
found. Then he leaps the orchard wall
and can scarcely be parted from his love.
Orslno has not yet found his Juliet, so
wooes by proxy. < 'â¢ â¢
Many of those who have read "Romeo
and Juliet" think Romeo a degenerate and
weakling, a milksop, moonshine lover.
Just the contrary is true. After he has
discerned his ideal in Juliet he is as man
ly as Mereutlo, and in due time beats Ty
balt, who is almost a professional duelist
and swordsman, at his own game. In-'
deed. Romeo needs but a few seconds to
dispatch him. Of course, nowhere but In
Italy could we find a man so chivalrous
and upright, so- pure and strong and ten
der. Orslno's is such a nature, or it would
have been manifestly unfit that Viola*
should come into his power. That he Is
not unmanly, with all his- sentiment, la
indicated to us In the proposal of Curio
that he go out to hunt. To an English
audience in Shakespeare's age, or any
age. the knowledge that a man is In the
habit of riding to hounds or of hunting
deer argues the very opposite of effem
inacy.
There are two strains of comedy run
ning through the play. The first Is re
fined and kindly and centers largely In
Olivia's rejecting the Duke, apparently be
cause of his un virile advances, while fall-
Ing In love with hia page, who Is a wom
an, and In later transferring her affec
tions to Sebastian, who Is no taller and
hardly more manly than his sister. There
is humor, too. of an exquisite sort In
Viola's dealings with both Olivia and the
Duke. Of course, Shakespeare has cre
ated Olivia merely to serve certain artistic
purposes with his heroine, and she suffers
In consequence as a character not a little.
Orslno also is constructed to suit the ex
igencies of bringing out the nature of
Viola. The author seems to have been at
tracted to the plot he borrows mainly by
the part of the heroine. Plays in which
the heroine masquerades In man's cloth-
Ing were not uncommon In Elizabethan
times. Shakespeare so disguises his hero
ines in "Two Gentlemen of Verona," "The
Merchant of Venice," "As Tou Like It"
and "Cymbellne," But In none of the sit
uations thus produced Is the Interest so
little in the Incident and so much in the
character and experiences of the dia
gulsed person as In the present case.
The second vein of comedy Is less soft
ened and refined. There must evidently
be action of a more rollicking sort to keep
the negotiations between the Duke and
Olivia from seeming too trivial and Inane.
Somebody Is needed also to stand between
Olivia and ourselves, and Maria supplies
that lack superbly. Sir Andrew la -wanted
to complete the comedy of the duel with
Viola and Sebastian. Sir Toby Is a chief
figure, having seen surely much service In
the wars abroad. He. too, seems an Eng
lish character, a sort of Captain John
Smith, whose contact with folk who till
vineyards In the south has been his bane.
He Is used principally to effect a physical
disposition of Malvolio. Without Malvo
llo's sanctimony and presumption the
main business of the play would seem too
bald. The drinking and maudlin talk and
singing, the Jests of the clown and the
countrified graces of Sir Andrew's danc
ing make the background on which the
love passages of the people of quality fail
to look absurd. The author's tact is seen
In the care he takes to Introduce the
coarse comedy between Sir Toby, Sir An
drew and Maria in scene S before Viola is
discovered in service with the Duke. His
tact Is exhibited, of course, in no less de
gree- In bringing on the other characters
of that sort in scene 5. Just before Olivia
unveils herself to her rival.
Viola wins us effectually at the outset
by her faithful wooing of ner rival In be
half of the man who haa her heart. There
is endless opportunity to be false and yet
;eem even to her own conscience true.
She Is curious, of course, to see her rival's
beauty, and this sho manages In a fairly
Impersonal way to bring about. "When
she discovers that Olivia has charms per
haps superior to her own she betrays no
disposition to take issue with a fact, as
her sex has so often done. Bhe shows no
spite, no envy, and we may be sure feels
none. She has no least thought of Indi
rection. She appears to be governed by a
faith, not unlike Imogen's, that the Issue
will content her.
Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness

It is too hard a, knot for me to untie.
Here we have mind, vision, character,
and. withal, nalveness in plenty. Viola
is even sorry for her rival's plight. She
does not rail against her nature or her
lot. She Is Interested like a philosopher
or a sociologist in the history that she
is helping to make.
After showlns how things gf> with Olivia
the author lets us see a chapter out of the
new life in Orslno's palace. We have di
vined how the hours are speeding. There
is no home more elegant In all the south,
yet we know that Viola has made herself
more indispensable than all its statues
and manuscripts and furnlshments. The
Duke has found the subtlo Influences of
her sex enveloping him. though he does
not euess whence the fajÂ»ctnation comes.
The strange comfort of Viola's presence
iriakes him seek her company and conver
sation. He wishes to have soft strains of
music played while he speaks to her.
How dost thora like this tune?
Violaâ It gives a very echo to the seat
Where Love la throned.
Dukeâ Thou dost speak masterly.

Violaâ A little, by your favor.

Strange confidences will grow up be
tween these twain, we may be sure, as the
days wear on. But Shakespeare is not in
tending to work out a study of what Vio
la's charms may win. Events at Olivia's
home shape an outcome speedily. Orslno
is. at length forced to resort to Olivia In
person that he may understand why she
regards his messenger more than himself.
He finds Olivia already a wife, and then
the other mysteries clear themselves.

KEAL ESTATE TRANSACTION'S.
The market considers this a certainty,
owing to the rapid recovery since January
1. Tha private rate, of discount fell rap
idly to 3% per. cent, but rose again to 4
per cent in consequence of the rise in the
Bank of England's rate. Call money,
however, was abundant at 4 per cent. The
market believes the Reichsbank will
maintain the present official rate until the
Bank of England reduces its rate. Other
wise the Reichsbank would make a re
duction sooner. Foreign exchange rose In
consequence of the rise In the Bank of
England rate. The Bourse followed the
new year'B boom In railways unwillingly,
Berlin believing the thing to be overdone.
Among trans- Atlantic securities Canadian
Pacifies took the lead.
BERLIN, Jan. 6.â The fears of the Lon
don and New York money markets have
left Berlin comparatively untouched. The
new year opened with a remarkable
plethora of money. Although Brussels
and Paris have discontinued discounting
here the mortgage banks have resumed
tendering, their position having been im
mensely strengthened by the meeting a
week ago of the Prussian Hypothekenak
tien Bank and the Deutsche Qrundschuld
Bank. The public Is now regaining con
fidence In these Institutions, and the re
turn of their obligations has almost
ceased. On the other hand, the demand
for mortgage bank obligations is begin
ning afresh. ,
The effect of the advance In the Banlc
of England's rate was unusually slight.
Hitherto the Reichsbank had always an
swered to the Bank of England advance.
In the present case, however,' notwith
standing the unprecedented pressure ' of
December 81, the Reichsbank rate of dis
count will be maintained.
Scarcely Noticed.
Advance of Bank of England Kate
LONDON, Jan. Â«.â L*at week the Stock
Exchange bad to stand the severest strain
known for a long time. If It cams through
safely it was mainly due to the .strength
and breadth of the American market. The
failures and panicky feeling- resulting'
from the collapse of the London and
Globe Finance Corporation (Limited) was
added to by an unexpected increase in the
Bank of England rate, and even now,
when the crisis seems to be safely passed,
those who are disposed to look upon the
gloomy* elde . of things fear that there la
â¢worse in store for the coming settlement,
when some big differences must be met.
In spite of the large realizations which
had taken place, especially In the Ameri
can market, a favorable turn came Fri
day, when New York bought up all it
could get at the lowest prices. \ This not
only set Tankees booming, but put the
other markets In better spirits, causing a
decided recovery all around, consols fin
ishing only one-half point lower, and
home rails, after losing one-half to one
point during the week, closing above the
worst figures. This upward movement In
Americans continued without check until
the close of the Stock Exchange yester
day.
The rise In the Bank of England rate,
which was chiefly a precautionary meas
ure, has not materially" affected the,
money market, as the supply of money
Is good owing to the release of Govern
ment dividends.

fThe Chief was escorted to the chair by
Trustee Rainsbury and met with an ova
tion. He said: "This has been the first
time that a police officer has laid his
hands on me, and if in no other way In
the future I will be perfectly satisfied.
Some of. my friends on the newspapers
say that I am trying to run the police
department and the Police Courts, but I
am satisfied to allow the Police Judges to
run their own courts. I have now. been
Chief for about eleven months, and when
I took charge there was more or less ap
prehension in the department as to prob
able changes. That feeling has now dis
appeared, and there is rest and content
among the members, because I have tried
them out and they have,- 1 think, tried me
out. I take It that electing me to this
honored position is an expression of ap
proval of the course I have. pursued, and
that fact makes me appreciate the honor
doubly. I shall assume the duties not In
a perfunctory manner, but will devote all
the time at my disposal to make the as
sociation successful ," and I appeal to the
other officers to assist me to that end. I
again thank you heartily for the honor
done me, and you will not regret it." '
The other officers also delivered brief
addresses and then an excellent . pro
gramme was presented, the retiring vice
president announcing the events and Ser
geant Conboy acting as master of ceremo
nies. The programme Included the follow
ing: Musical selections, Eugene Gorman

The association was - organized ', in 1878,
It was a happy Idea that inspired the
retiring officers of the Widows' and Or
phans' Aid Association of the police de
partment to make the installation of the
new officers of more than usual interest,
and the result was seen yesterday after
noon in Judge Mogan's courtroom, at the
Hall of Justice, which was crowded with
members and their friends, including sev
eral ladies, who faced the storm rather
than miss the treat that they expected^
and they were not disappointed.

Second TJnitarlan Church welcomes
Its New Pastor.
Rev. Edward F. Dinsmore was In
stalled last evening as pastor of the
Second Unitarian Church, Twentieth
and Capp streets, in the presence of a
large congregation. The sacred edi
fice was crowded to the doors and the
occasion of the installation was
marked with extreme solemnity. A
carefully prepared musical programme
was rendered by a large choir and the
Interior of the church was decorated
with evergreens.
.After the opening voluntary on the
organ and the singing of a hymn by
the choir. Rev. Charles H. Cook read
the scriptural selections. The Rev.
George Wv; Stone delivered a short
sermon on "The Modern Pulpit" and
the Rev. A. J. Wells offered up the
prayer of installation.
The Rev. F. L.. Hosmer delivered the
charge to the new pastor and a dis
course on the hand of fellowship was
made by the Rev. George R. Dodson.
The Rev. Bradford Leavitt extended
a welcome to the new pastor, sneaking
for the various ministers of the Uni
tarian churches In this city and across
the bay. On behalf of the lay mem
bers Henry N. Clement, president of
the board, extended a welcome
to the pastor. The ceremonies closed
with the benediction b" the newly
installed minister, after which con
gratulations were extended by the
members of the congregation.
first of the series of Sun-
I day evening addresses to be de-
I livered at the First "Unitarian
JJL Church, Geary and Franklin
streets, was presented last
night, the speaker being Presi
dent V. "W. Dohrmann of the Mer
chants* Association. The course of
lectures will be on the general sub
ject of "The Future of Our State and
City," the subject assigned to Mr.
Dohrmann being "Good Government."
Rev. Bradford Leavitt, minister of
the church, at the close of the reg
ular service, briefly Introduced Mr.
Dohrmann, who was listened to with
marked attention by the congregation.
Mr. Dohrmann in opening his ad
dress s=aid that if some of the beau
tiful sentiments pronounced by the
minister during the service had always
been lived up to by mankind it would
not be necessary for any one to come
forward and speak on the subject of
good government.
"I do not speak to you as a scholar
or a philosopher." said Mr. Dohrmann.
"but as a plain business man and citi
zen. I am brought every day into
contact with vital affairs and will try
to tell you of the little happenings of
city government, which, however,
mean so much. I will not speak to
you on the past government of our
country or our State; that task is re
served for others. I will speak to you
on our city government as I have
found It by actual contact. Seven
Next Sunday evening Professor Da
vid Starr Jordan will deliver an ad
dress on* "Education"; on Sunday
evening. January 20. Irving M. Scott
will speak on "Commerce and Trade."
and on Sunday evening, January 27,
the speakers will be Robert Fletcher
"These are but a few instances of
the benefits of the new system, and if
applied In aH directions will mean that
in a short time we will have a surplus
of money for much needed improve
ments. The moral effect will be a
marked one. No longer will honest
men stand aloof from municipal af
fairs.-for they will not be afraid to en
ter the arena. The man of bad char
acter will not be held up as an example
of municipal success, and the rising
generation will respect their teachers
when they realize that the educators
do not owe their positions to a perni
cious system of political reward. As
each citizen makes his home pure and
clean, so he should try to make the
citizens" homes the same. Good citi
zenship means good government. TVe
will not falter in the work, and with
'the assistance of our neighbors we
trust to make San Francisco the most
beautiful, prosperous and joyful city
on the Pacific Coast."
Mr. Dohrmann then traced the birth
of the new charter and explained its
cardinal points, the chief of which
were the right of the city to rule it
self, civil service 'reform, the merit
system and economical government.
He explained the working of the char
ter, how it provided for legislation,
taxation and revenue, took â¢ care of
public works, streets, sewers, lighting,
water supply and transportation and
the adornment of the city. The charter
provided for police and fire protection,
better school facilities, sanitation and
health regulations and the support of
the aged, disabled and poor.
Mr. Dohrmann then explained the
benefits that had accrued to the city
the year in which the charter had
been in force. The men in office were
responsible, the system of administra
tion was economical and the subordi
nates were efficient. No ring existed
in the city government, and the spoils
system was a thing of the past. No
dishonest contracts were made, a ma
terial saving was found in the gas and
water rates and the" people had confi
dence in the municipal government.
The Recorder, who had at first op
posed the merit -system, but now fa
vored it, had in one year effected a
saving of more than $5000 in his office
and i had made it self-sustaining. In
closing, Mr. Dohrmann said:
years ago the -Merchants* Association
tried to remove some of the evils of
our city government. A general Im
pression existed at that time that all
. city governments were bad. One
writer declared that municipal govern
â¢ ment was the greatest failure of the
age. To speak of the conditions as
we found them In our city is to speak
of the condition of all cities of our
size. " I am glad to say,~ however,
that when we Investigated we did not
find everything bad. " "We found a few
good qualities, a few honest men and
some good laws, but all these were In
the minority. -We found an accumula
tion of laws, but as soon as anything
new was wanted, a new law was
passed, In order that some scheme
might be put through. The law,
spirit and system were bad and the ad
ministration was in the hands, of the
spoilsmen. "We found all these con
ditions and we decided that the city
needed new laws and new people in
official life, to give the people the law
as provided by the .constitution- and
honest men to administer it."
Congregation of the First Unitarian Church Listens to the Open
ing Address of a Series Which Is to Be Delivered During
Month on Subject of "The: Future of Our State and" City."
