gazing at the awful spectacle.
So far the course of love had run
emothly' for. Nora, . As an ; assurance of
the reality of his coming wealth Chad
wiek presented to his^ prospective father
and mother in raw\a document which" bore
a gilt seal and several official looking
.stamps, That document read as follows;
SHows Old Folks the Document,
Was ever a young and Innocent coun
try girl given a better opportunity to be
dazzled? Furniture galore was ordered.
A fine settlement should Nora have
$30,000 at the least. Charles "W. Ashford,
an attorney of this city, was instructed to
draw up In triplicate, engrossing the
same instead of typewriting them, a-pre
nuptlal settlement, giving Nora $20,000 In
her own rich t. Ashford was also In
structed to find a location In Oakland
upon which to erect a mansion. At -the
same time, to provide for the present
emergencies, pending the payment of the
coming $155,000, the amount of the legacy
from the deceased aunt, Ashford drew by
instruction papers to effect the transfer
of the lucrative practice of a certain
thriving country physician to Chadwick.
Then followed a certain momentous visit
to San Francisco, when Chadwick took
Nora* as she Is called, and her mother to
the White House, there to select the^girl's
trousseau. None but the costliest fabrics
would do. Nora, the pretty^ country; girl,
must be garbed like a' queen to suit the
esthetic taste of -.this princely purchaser.
A bill of goods amounting to more than
$700 was ordered. On Nora's engagement
finger already Â¦ glittered a $250 diamond
ring, the gift of Chadwick. Already he
had ordered for her a diamond tiara to
cost $1500 and diamond earrings to cost
$400.
Chadwick was not slow to see his ad
vantage. Like Claude Melnotte, he prom
ised jewels,, costly apparel, a handsome
home, luxury. In due time the parents
sent out notices of the engagement of
their daughter to Chadwick.
Less than 8ix weeks ago Ernest Moore
Chadwick appeared for the first time at
Crockett. He was seemingly without
money or friends.' He accepted a position
as waiter In a hotel, so the .story goes.
Hardly a week had passed before he saw
pretty Xora Schneider. From that mo
ment, seemingly, dated his purpose to woo
and win her. He Is educated and Is a phy
sician, and fraternal society . membership
gave him the chance to rise and resume
the position of a professional man. .In a
fortnight he was assisting lnt the practice
of a Port Costa physician. Directly there
after he posed as a. capitalist, as the.pos
sessor of money in hand and the heir to
the large estate of an aunt in England.
Then he felt qualified to pay his addresses
to. pretty Nora, and as many another girl
has done, Ehe listened to his ardent words
and looked upon him as a desirable suitor.
PRETTY Noralne Pearl Schneider
was hurriedly married last Sat
urday night at Crockett to Ernest
Moore Chadwick. This simple
announcement marks the culmin
ation of a village romance in which sup
posititious fortunes, tiaras of diamonds,
costly gowns, bank drafts, the love of a
little country maiden, the scheming of an
adventurer and dreams such as Claude
Melnotte might have inspired mlnglf.

explained that the conference committee
had agreed upon the eleven points of dif

the exception of two. Both of these
amendments v.ere offered by Butler of

GOSHEN. Ind., . Feb. 26.â Passenger
train No, 9 on the Wabash, w-hich left
Buffalo last night, scheduled to^arrive in
Chicago this morning, was wrecked two
miles west of Millersburg "at 9:35 o'clock
this morning. The accident was' caused
by a broken rail.- The engine piussed over
the break- in safety, but the six. cars fol
lowing left the .rails, and one - of â¢' them
the , rear Pullman, rolled over on*- it's side'
and slid down a twenty-five foot embank
ment. Of the forty or more persons in
the train not one escaped injury, twelve
being severely hurt, some of whom will
probably die.
The railroad officials were very promot
in securing surgical aid and in a short
time special trains bearing surgeons were
hurrying to the scene of the wreck from
every available point in Northern Indiana.
Lake Shore Road officials also made ud
a relief train and .carried doctors to the
relief of the injured.
The little hotels at Mlllersburp and Ben '
ton, several miles from the scene of the,
wreck, were turned into hospitals. No
deaths are thus far reported, but some of
the Injured are. in a critical condition.

BERT SIMPSON. 17 years old.
FRANK DWYER, single.
With the exception of Thomas Simpson
and his son and Frank Dwyer, all the vic
tims are Austrlans. In addition there are
five Italians and seven Finlanders, whose
names are not yet learned, making a total
of thirty-six lives lost. It is given out by
Superintendent Thomas Sneddon and con
firmed by others familiar with the condi
tions that the lives of all the men were
certainly extinct within tnree minutes of
the lire gaining the ascendency.
The tire is believed to be extinguished.
At any rate, it is fully under control, and
Superintendent Sneddon announces that
he will open the mine to-morrow for the
recovery of the bodies. Preparations are
now under way for the reception of tho
bodies, the blacksmith shop having been
prepared as a temporary morgue.
While the horror is of less proportions
than the disaster at the Scotleld mines
anfl the still later one in British Colum
bia, it is still sufficient to impress itself.
The large proportion of men of families
among the victims adds to the general
distress, and all night long women and
children hung around the slopes filling
the air with their lamentations for their
lost husbands and fathers. By daylight
mopt of them were removed by thc gentle
hands of ministering friends."
An additional tragedy followed the main
one to-day. Thomas Simpson, who with
his young son Is among the victims, cams
to Diamondville from Alabama but six
weeks ago. bringing thc wife and mother,
in the hope the change of climate would
benefit her. The shock of last nights
tragedy wa* too great for Mrs. Simpson's
dÂ«licatÂ« health and to-day she died;- thus
every member -of this family is a victim
to the disaster. There are many other
sad and distressing incidents to be witr
nissed, but none more pathetic.
The origin of the fire has not been defi
nitely determined, but it Is thought it was
the result of carelessness by some one in
the drivers' cabin, back of the sixth level.
At this point the drivers congregate while
waiting for their loads, and it ia thought
a lighted wiFk was. left to smolder
among the rubbish.
The fire was discovered by Driver James I
Hudson and he states that had the miners !
who have lost their lives been English!
speaking the death list would hate been
much lower, for he gave the alarm
thoroughly and was severely burned him- j
self in his efforta to communicate the
danger to the unfortunates. He was him
self rescued with great difficulty and is
now under the doctor's care. The failure
of Simpson and njs son and Dwytr to re
spond to his summons is accounted for
by their too far distance to hear Hudson's
voice. Shortly after the breaking out of
the fire Superintendent Sneddon. arrived
Examination proved to him the impossi
bility of a single soul being alive in the
flames and heavy gases generated.
Several heroic attempts at rescue were
made, but all without avail, and when thÂ©
hopelessness of saving any lives became
apparent. Superintendent Sneddon gave
orders to close the .level. This was done
at once, with the result that the fire was
brought fully under control, every open
ing being hermetleally-sealed.
o 1 * 1^ Prompt action of Superintendent
Sneddon in closing the mine and thus con
fining the fire and ultimately extinguish
ing it has prevented a vast property loss
and will make It possible for the companv
to resume operations without much loss o'f
time, in fact Mr. Sneddon has advised the
Oregon Short Line officials that the shut
down resulting from thc fire will be but
temporary and that he will resume work
before the close of this week. The experi
ence of the company In its fire in the
Fame mine two years ago. when the mine
wr.s closed for many months and a vast
property loss entailed, is not to be repeat
ed. Ever since the last fire was brought
under control the management has been
preparing for a repetition. False bulk
heads were put in on every level, with the
necessary material at hand. By this
means any portion of the mine could be
quickly and effectually converted into an
air-tight and fire-tight compartment.
These conditions prevailed last night and
when the hopelessness of recovering anv
il ves became apparent Mr. Sneddon
promptly sealed the portion on fire

"WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â Soon after the
Senate convened to-dav a bill to supple

tion of public lands was passed. It pro-
Lvides for the division of lands in-Okla

of county seats, for the erection of court

porary county officials.
The resolution of Morpan, coming over
from yesterday, declaring the Nicaragua
canal bill, the unfinished business of Uio
Senate, was called up. After Morgan had
made a brief statement regarding the
Safe Insurance.
In these days when there Is with many
companies no attempt to sell life insur
ance as such, but speculative insurance in
its stead, it is gratifying to those who be
lieve in life Insurance to see such a
healthy showing as is made by the Con
necticut" Mutual Life Insurance Company
Its assets of $66,000,000 have increased by
nearly $11,000,000 since 18S5, its surplus has
grown from $4,500,000 to over $7,000,000, and
the total amount of insurance in force
among its 68,361-pollcy holders has reached
over $161,500,000. During the same fifteen
years dividends amounting to s $17,200 000
nave been paid to policy holders. Always
a conservative company, the Connecticut
Mutual Life is stronger to-day than -ever
before, and 'shows abundant evidences of
sound growth and fruitfulness. It Is not
the size of the company, but what it doea
for us policy holders that most concerns
them. None. has. brought better results
to ltBorcembers than the staid, solid, old

Bill for a New Arrangement
of Lands Is Passed in
. the Senate.
Ppecl.il Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET.
N. W,, WASHINGTON', Feb. 26.â To the
sincere regret, not only of his own friends
but of those of Rear Admiral Schley,
Rear Admiral, /Scmpcon has, by
his unfortunate criticism of the enlisted
men of the navy, prevented the enact
ment of . legislation to reward the flag
officers of the Santiago fleet. 'Â¦''.-
The intense feeling excited by the pub
lication of his' indorsement of the appli
cation of Gunner Charles Morgan for
recommendation for .promotion to the
grade of ensign was manifested in the
Senate to-day when Senator Allen of
vigorously assailed, the rear ad
miral.
"If Sampson wrote 'that letter." Allen
exclaimed, vhe Ts'a conceited ass."
Although Rear Admiral Schley's friends
were as anxious as those of Rear Admiral
Sampson that there should be no com
ment on the Morgan letter; they: were un
able to induce Senator Allen to refrain
from discussing it. The feeling which ex
ists against Rear Admiral" Sampson was
demonstrated both by the approval given
by the Senators to the. remarks of the
Nebraskan and the applause he receiX'ed
from the galleries." Encouraged by the
sympathy of his auditors Senator; Allen,
not content with calling Rear Admiral
Sampson a "conceited ass," denounced
him as "an arrant coward." ,
The incident occurfed when considera
tion of the army appropriation bill was
resumed. Morgan yielded the floor tem
porarily to Allen. After saying he was
satisfied the Philippine amendment and
the Cuban amendment to the pending bill
were unconstitutional, and objecting to
the conferring of such extraordinary
power upon the President, Allen read the
letter purporting to have been sent by
Chief Gunner Charles Morgan of the
navy to Rear Admiral V\\ T. Sampson,
requesting him to forward to the Navy
Department his application for promotion
to the rank of ensign, under a provision
of the pending naval appropriation bill.
He also read thc Indorsement of Admiral
Sampson upon the application of Gunner
Morgan, in th,o. course, of which the ad
miral is represented as saying, in brief,
that while he recognized Gunner Mor
gan's technical and professional ability,
ho was opposed to appointing warrant
officers to the grade of ensign because
they had not enjoyed the social advan
tages which Admiral Sampson held a
commissioned officer of the navy should
have enjoyed so that he might represent
properly his country, in foreign coun
tries particularly.
The indorsement of Admiral Sampson
expressed the admiral's hop>" that the
Secretary of the Navy would not ttnd it
necessary to recommend the promotion
of warrant officers of the navy to the
rank of commissioned officers. He said
the Indorsements proved beyond a
shadow of doubt tliat there wa.Â« "a snob
bish.aristocracy in the navy that IS detri
mental to the country and a disgrace to
the country, represented by this officer
and other like officers."
"If Admiral Sampson is the author of
those indorsements," declared Allen with
vehemence, "he is a conceited ass, and he
ought to be marked down as such. We
are not bringing up in this country a race
of snobs. It I am correctly Informed
there was a time when Sampson was no
better than Charles Morgan, the gunner.
"He came from no better stock. I nra
glad to repeat that we are not raising In
the United States a ' class of bejeweled
aristocrats. " If this rank and arrant cow
ard-is-to be believed, the time may- never
come in this country when, a poor boy
may attain to such a position as his abil
ities warrant him holding."
As Morgan rose to resume his speech,
Mr. Alien remarked: . â¢ .
"I want to say to Sampson and to his
friends that I am responsible for what I
say.''
Senator Chandler .appealed- to Morgaji
to yield briefly to him that he might re
ply to Allen, but as several Senators,
among them Teller, Pettlgrew and Stew
art, announced their desire to reply to
Chandler, Morgan declined to accede to
Chandler's appeal. - -
Continuing his address, Morgan reached
the Cuban amendment, which he declared
was a "legislative ultimatum." Morgan
Insisted that Cuba never could and never
would accept the terms imposed by thÂ«
Government, and this Government had no
right to demand that she should accept
them, since she "cannot accept them and
preserve at the same time her dignity a3
a sowrelgn and Independent nation."
In the House the old controversy be
tween Armirals Sampson and Schley was
made the subject of comment by Berry of
Kentucky, who said it still was the evi
dent purpose of the Navy Department to
confer the highest honor upon the man
who was "farthest away" at the battle of
Santiago. He had read Admiral Sampson'3
alleged recent letter to Secretary Long
as to the inadvisablllty of giving warrant
officers in the navy commissions on ac
count cf their lack of social refinement.
Berry said that Admiral Sampson, who
had written the letter, was of extremely
humble origin himself and whatever re
finement he had was due to his service in
thft American navy. He contrasted Ad
miral Sampwn's attitude toward the men
of the navy 'with Admiral Schley's action
during the stress of battle In sending
word to those below that "all went well,'"
and when the battle was over in saying
that the victory belonged to the "men
behind the. guns." i
Sulzer of New .York indorsed everything
Berry had said. The incident ended
there.

WASHINGTON', Ftb. 26.â During one of
the debates in the House to-day. Lentz of
Ohio started, another tumult. He declared
that under the general leave to print
granted some days ago he "had prepared
a si><?pch for the Record yesterday which
had .not appeared and upon inquiry to-day
he , had been informed that it had beer,
Â¦withheld by the direction of the' Speaker
of the House and that !t was now In the
hands of Mr. Grosvenor. He demanded to
know by what authority it had been with
held from the Record. ,
Th?? Speaker stated that his attention
had -been called to what was said to be l
great aba r-e of the privileges! of thc House
-y^der.tHi* general leave to print, and lio
had arJced that the speech of the gentle
man be -withheld until he had an oppor
tunity to look 1: over. But the pressure oi
"pubH*- burlrteÂ«? had been <<uch that he had
riot had time to do this, and within 'twenty
mfnvtes he had directed that it should go
Into ' the KecGrd. Subsequently, if it ap
peared that the speech contained anything
offeQsfve cr wrong it could be corrected
bv the House.
Ijesiiz asserted that no living man could
have known a word of what his speech
contained until 9:50 o'clock last night and
that therefore whoever told the chatr
what it was said to contain had falsified.
The Speaker replied that the matter had
been: brought to his attention by a repre
sentative of the Government printing
office. Mr. Richard?on, the minority lead
er, read the following:
Resolved. That the Speaker of the Houte has
no rig-ht to withhold from the Record the
speech of any member made under general
leave to print.
Representative Cannon raised a point of
order against the resolution, but the
Speaker held that it was in order. The
Speaker added that he had no intention
of keeping Lentz" speech out of the Rec
ord,! but had asked to have it held until
he could look Into the representations
which had been made to him. The House
voted IIS to 130 not to consider the resolu
tion. As soon as the result was an
nounced Richardson offered as a matter
of privilege affecting the integrity of the
House the following resolution:
Whereas. The speech of Mr. Lentz of Ohio
en' tne fneral deficiency bill, made In the
Howe V. ednefJay last.. February 20, has been
W!th*i*!d frrrn publication In the Congressional
H^r-srd. after the same wan delivered to the
Public Printer for publication by Mr. Lentz;
and
Wbrreas. Paid speech has been turned over
to the Speaker of the House, who, it is al
l'*Fe4. has delivered the same to a member
of the House for some purpose to the House
unknown..
ResolvM. That Fuch action Is hereby con
deir.ned by the House, and It is hereby ordered
ths.t said er>*eeh he <iÂ«>iivere<J forthwith to the
Public Printer for publication in the Record.
A scene of the wildest confusion fol
lowed. Party feeling by this time was
at fever prtch. A dozen members were
on their feet clamoring for recognition.
Payne, the Republican leader, sought to
make a point of order that the consid
eration of the conference report before
the House could not be interrupted by
such an Interruption, to which Richard
son cried out that the matter was one of
the 'highest privileges affecting: the in
tegrity of the House. The Speaker- ruled
that thÂ« conference report .having been
voted down was not before the House, and
that the resolution was in order. â¢
Afrairi Lace>* <R.) of Iowa raised the
question of consideration. â¢ Members on
each side were shouting at .each other
across the political aisle. The Speaker
pounded vainly for order. Grosvenor (R.)
of Ohio and Wheeler (D.) of Kentucky
were engaged in a wordy duel, but- what
they eaid could not be heard In the din
and confusion. At last, when order was
restored, the Speaker ruled that the ques
tion of consideration could be raised
against any proposition, and the vote was
taken. Each side voted solidly and the
House refused to consider the resolution,
115 to 127. As soon as the result was an
nounced.- Payne, the Republican leader,
moved an adjournment.
"I make a point that the motion is dila
tory." shouted Richardson.
"The chair overrules the point." said
the Speaker blandly, as he put the ques
tion. By a strict party vote. 115 to 101,
the motion was carried, and at 6:</o o'clock
the HcusÂ« adjourned.

down the river Is more serious- to-nlght
than ever. " Two fresh breaks In the- levee
below Freeport occurred this morning,
and they have gradually widened until
one of them is now forty feet across and
the other sixty."
The breaks are 200 or 300 feet apart, and
should the space of levee still standing
between the two succumb, as it is feared
It must, an immense volume of water will
descend from the river upon thousands of
acres of valuable land Included In the
river district.
The river at Freeport to-night showed a
decrease of. one ami a half Inches, a cir
cumstance which -offers , hope, since the
water had been on a level with the crest
of the levee, and' the slightest" increase
would have swept it over tbÂ« banks. Here
and. there the. patrolmen vwho line both
sides of the river discovered gopher holes
through which the water .; had- found its
way, thus . undermining the earthen bar
riers ;: but through the strictest vigilance
these holes were attended to before: harm
resulted. The -same care is ..being * exer- i
cised to-night, and will continue until the
period of danger, has passed." â The water
is pouring through the 1 Freeport breaks '
seven feet deep,' and it is- feared that the
I continued washing will melt the levee
j away. . " Â¦
r The Supervisors at a special meeting to
! night decided to put. a piledTiver at. work
to-morrow . at the scene of ; the reported
breaks. It is believed that by driving
piles In the river In front and on the 6ide3
of Hhe: breaks and then ' depositing brush
and sandbags -â¢ behind . these .. -works the
flood may be 5 checked at other points of
the river. ' .

noes.
Anderson offered an amendment to make
it necessary that the petition for county
division be signed .by three-fifths of the
resident landowners of the entire county.
The original bill permits division if the
petition be signed by electors residing
within the limits of the proposed count y
to the number of one-fifth of the electors
of the entire county. Broughton made a
ten-minute speech against -. the amend
ment, arguing that its effect would be to
kill the efficacy of the bill and make
county division impossible.
Knowland spoke for the amendmert.
He said the original bill was a dangerou-?
measure. The entire county should have
a voice in the matter of division. The-blll
as it stood would be used as a whip by
sections of a county to force patronage,
threatening division unless their wishes,
however unjust, were granted.
The amendment was lost by a vpte of
27 ayes to 35 noes. The bill was then put
on Us final passage and lost.

members of the, local lodge of Rebekahs
had a peculiar experience last night. They
were to have instituted a new lodge of
Rebekahs at Boulder Creek early In the
evening, but the lodge was not called to
order until 1:20 o'clock this morning and
did not close until 6 o'clock. The Re
bekahs had expected to return" on a spe
cial train to Santa Cruz shortly after
midnight, but they did not . arrive In
Boulder Creek until alter that hour.
The Rebekahs left this city shortly after
5 o'clock. When their train was a mile
beyond Felton it was stopped by a wash
cut fifty feet long and forty feet in depth.
The grade had given way just ten min
utes before the arrival of the train and
was not discovered until the train, was
almost upon it. Had it occurred during
the night it is probable that a heavy loss
of life would have resulted. The wash
out was caused by water backing up
against a small culvert, eventually caus
ing the fill to give way. ,;'=.
The train backed to Felton, took aboard
timber, section men and the Southern
Pacitlc bridge carpenters and carried
them to the scene of the washout, where
for six hours they worked until a culvert
was completed and the grade filled in.
The train passed over safely, reaching
Boulder fifteen minutes after midnight.
.It had been planned to have a banquet
after the institution of the lodge, but this
programme was changed and the banquet
came first. The lodge opened at 1:30
o'clock and the new branch was installed
with seventy-one charter members. The
work was conducted by Mrs. Cornelia
Reid, special district deputy grand ma
tron, assisted by Mrs. Kate Wessendorf,
as grand marshal, and Mrs. A. "WV Ken
dall assistant deputy grand master.
The officers of the new lodge are: Xoble
grand, Mrs. Emma Dool; vice grand, Mrs.
Miller; recording secretary, Mrs. Fannie
Rodgers; financial secretary, Mrs. Josie
Trout: treasurer. Miss Lucy Ball; trus
teesâMrs. Cummings and Mrs. H. Hollen

'.'No action has been taken as yet by the
Board of Work3 on the communication
sent by the Civil Service Commission,"
said Commissioner Manson. "It is clear,
however, that it, desires to usurp a prerog
ative which/ we believe, belongs solely to
us. namely, that-of judging of the relative
efficiency of the men whom we employ.
There appears to be two conflicting pro
vtfions in the charter and the City Xttoi
ney will be called on to. determine/which
one Is supreme. One section makes an ap
pclntment depend on the scholastic stand
in g_oftheclyil s e rv iceellg ibUstheother
For reasons- herein presented and by virtue
of the authority granted in the charter thlÂ»
commission disapproves the . action *bf your
honorable board in ordering -the aforesaid sus
pension of appointees from the eligible or regis
tration lists, except in the "Inverse order of
their appointment. A copy ot this communi
cation has .been forwarded to his Honor, the
Mayor.
It Is apparent that the relative positions of
these mechanics and laborers upon the eligible
and resiBtration lists of this commission have
not been observed by your honorable board.
Appointees of lower standing have been re
tained, while those of higher standing upon
these lists have been suspended. Neither your
communication nor the report of the Chief of
the Bureau of Streets furnishes any charges
upon which these particular suspensions have
been ordered. No charge of Inefficiency or In
competency Is made In your communication,
nor has any- such charge been made at any
time against any of the parties thus suspend
ed. .We must therefore assume that they are
equally competent with those who have been
retained.
In the cape of the pavers we find that No-.
7, S and 14 have been . suspended, although Xos.
9, 10, 12, 13 and IT have been retained. In the
case of the rammers we find that No*. 1, 4 and
11 have. been suspended, although Xos. 2, ,5, 6,
7. 8, 10. 12, 13, 14 and 15 have been retained. In
'the case of the laborers we find that Noa. 15,
26. 28. 37, 40. 43. 45, 60, 61. 55, 57. 58 and 62 hav
been suÂ«pended. although Nos. 27, 36. 38. 42. 44,
46, 48, 4fÂ», 66, 60, 61 and 63 have been retained.
A clash between the Board of Public
Works and the Board of -Civil Service
Commissioners is imminent, owing to the
latter body lnsjstins that employes taken
from the eligible list be suspended only
according to the inverse order of their
appointment.
The Civil Service Board delivered its ul
timatum yesterday when it notified the
Board of Public Works that some ram
mers, pavers and laborers had been sus
pended without regard to their relative '
standing on tho eligible and registration:
lists. The communication states that the '
commission disapproves of .the action of I
the board and practically orders it to re- |
instate the men who were dismissed and
who stand higher up on the list than those
who were retained. Here is where the
commission will strike a snag and it is
on this rock that both boards will split.
While no official action has yet been taken
by the Board of Public Works, Commis
sioner Manson' stated yesterday that Is
sue would be taken with the Civil Service
Commission and the disputed "points
would be submitted to the City Attorney
for % settlement before the ultimatum
would be accented. Manson expressed
the opinion that the Board^of Works was
the best judge of the efficiency of .its em
ployes. While the charter in one place
recognizes the scholastic standing of civil
service ellgibles to be the mark of prefer
ence in appointments, Manson held that
another section places the powsev of prop
erly administering/ the affairs of tne
Board of Works in its own hands. In its
communication the Civil Service Board
says:
gives the Board of Works the power of
doing things necessary for a proper ad
ministration of Its affairs. The heads of
our 1 departments are certainly better
qualified than any one else to determine
the efficiency of those under their charge,
as they draw conclusions from rmctical
observations, while the Civil Service
Board bases results on theory alone."

HAVANA, Feb. 26. -General Gomez vis
ited Governor General Wood this morning
and assured him that the stories of un
rest and" dissatisfaction at the continuance
of the. .United States .Intervention were
false, and that he had been misrepresent
ed in statements .to the effect that he fa
vored" an immediate- withdrawal" of the
United States troops and giving Cuba ab
solute independence. If they withdraw
now he feared "bloodshed. Beyond doubt
within sixty, days the Cubans would be
fighting among themselves. .' General Go
mez added: â¢
"If the Americans were to withdraw, to
day I would go with them.."
General Gomez- said .he recognized the
fact that the United States was responsi
ble for the establishment of a stable gov
ernment in Cuba. and could not withdraw
until, such aid was brought, about. The
work of handing over the- reins of gov
ernment to the new republic was .an un
dertaking Involving much time and labor
and a large amount. 6f study and, expe
rience on.' the part of Cubans in the work
of self-government. The general also said
the. element in control of the municipali
ties was not working in the interest of
the isjand. , The officials were* inexpe
rienced and* could not be given a- free
hand. It would mean the destruction and
ruination of the island. *â¢

*BMiilkmÂ» Dr. Wong Woo, the eminent
Chinese- physician, was called, and with one
dose of his tea stopped the flow of blood, there-
by saving my life, as I had been given up by
my white physician, ae well as by all my
friends. Was unconscious four weeks, but by Dr.
Â¦Wong Woo's wonderful skill he saved my life
from this most fatal of all feverx.- Although I
was confined to- my bed three months, -was
able to Â¦ resume my vocation Â»ln six months
from the time I went to bed, and now I
weigh 202 pounds, more than I had ever at-
tained previously. I would cheerfully recom-

{3-j-|-^HE British shio Matterhorn lost
II onÂ© of her crÂ«w yesterday. Sha
. I arrived hero from Liverpool snver-
W al weeks agro and 'was one cf the
last sailing" vessels broueht into
port by Pilot Fred Jordan. It was a beau
tiful, clear evening and just about sun
set the tug took hold of her and brought
the big- ship to anchorage off Meiggs
wharf.
j If the crew, of the Matierhorn had fine
weather at the end of the voyage it was
surely to compensate them for the hard
time they had In the English Chan
nel. After getting av.-ay from Liverpool
it blew a gale .for four days and then
fine weather set in. Tnere was a lot of
spare rope on deck and Cantain Warrcu
ordered It put in the forepcak. When tho
hatch was taken off some of the sailors
dropped into the hold. There they found
a boy more dead than alive. He ha-i
stowed away the night before the ship
went to sea and for four days and live
nights had nothing- to eat and not a drop
of water to drink.. He was passed on dec*
and cnrrlsd aft to the cabin, where Cao
tain Warren did everything possible.
With careful nursing the boy gradually
recovered and was coon rblo to f;o for
ward and give a helping hand. He told
Captain Warren that- his name was
Michael Maher and that ho was 19 years
old. His father Is a sailor on an ocea^i
steamer and refused to allow the bov to
go to sea. Michael took the law into his
own hands and stowed away on the Mat
terhorn.
As young Maher did not want to go
back to England Captain Warren got him
a Job on the bark Apdrew Welch as cabin
boy at $20 a month and Michael was in
5talled in his new o.uarters yesterday.
The Andrew Welch Is .one of the suear
fleet, so younp Maher vill have a chance
to see Honolulu. . -
TRANSPORT AZTEC ARRIVES.
Is Thirty-One Days From Nagasaki,
Owing to Head Winds.
ThÂ© United States chartered army
transport Aztec arrived from Nag-asakl
yesterday just -when everybody was won
dering 1 what had become of her. She Is
flying light and the engineers had a ter
rible time of it. For fifteen days It blew
a hÂ«=avy gale from tha east and in order
to keep the wheel from, racing- an en
cineer had to stand night and day with
his hand on the throttle. The Aztec was
thirty-one days making the trip.
The Aztec brought up only one passen
per. Major Palmer G. Wood of the Forty
tlrst Infantry.
It is a very pad homecoming for Major
Wood, as he brings home the remains of
his son. Second Lieutenant Palmer G.
Wood Jr. of the Twelfth Infantry, who
died, in th<? Philippines from enteric fever.
This is the second son Ma.ior Wood has
lost since the war began. His other boy
died in Cuba and his father went to Santi
ago and broug-ht the body home. The re
mains of Lieutenant Wood will be taken
East and laid beside his brother.
The chances are that the Aztec will be
sent back to Manila with supplies, as she
and the Pak Llnpr are the only two vessels
in port fit for service. The transport
Warren may be temporarily fixed up and
sent out on March 16, as there are now
nearly S0O troops at the Presidio ready to
be sent to the Philippines.

Sii__i_i__n_i Â¦ Â¦ 1 cIf Lord Roberts is to get a new title when the King
is crowned he would better select one that will. fit. :His
present title of Viscount St. Pierre and Earl of Kan
dahar and Pretoria is so dumsy. his best friend
wouldn't recognize him if he were seen staggering
under it.
The Legislature of New Mexico wants to make the
playing of football a misdemeanor. This appears to
be an effort designed ioÂ°make light=of a grave offense.
The'nianner in which football is- generally played sug
gests to the ordinary observer that it is a crime.
The Omaha kidnaper who has been caught has had
at least one satisfaction. * He had an advantage which
his victim did not possessâ he; had every o reason to
believe that no effort was being lost to secure him and
put him out of harm's way.
A demand has been made in the English House of
Commons that members of that "â¢ august assembly
must be permitted to speak in the language which is
most familiar to them. This certainly ought to be en
couraging to those orators that have been taking un
'due liberties with the King's English.
In his address before the Massachusetts Legislature
on Lincoln's birthday Senator Hoar said the man who
seeks to enter the Senate by means of corruption and
bribery should be shunned as if he had leprosy; and
now the loungers of the Senate gallery ought to havi
a good deal of fun .watching the Senator dodge his
Kansas has just given the world another illustration
of her ability to confuse everything that comes within
the sphere of her influence. When Victoria died the
Legislature of the State thought it becoming the dig
nity of Kansas to send a message of condolence to
King Edward, but the message evidently misled the
royal secretary, for in response he sent back the fol
lowing: "The private secretary is commanded to
convey the thanks of the King for the expressions of
loyalty and sympathy contained in "the message which
you forwarded to his Majesty on January 31, 1901."
Now, as the Kansas men never expressed any loyalty
to Edward and do not feel any, they have refused to
spread tire reply upon the records, and there is talk
of sending Mrs. Carrie Nation over to London to
remonstrate with the secretary.
Very different is the view of the question taken by
the Germans. It is asserted in Berlin that the duty
imposed upon American goods was designed mainly
as a warning to Germany. It is argued that the
American trade is a matter of comparatively little
importance to Russra, and that the Russian Finance 1
"Minister impojed maximum duties upon American
imports solely for the purpose of impressing upon
Germany that if Russian exports to that country arÂ»
interfered with the Russian Government will not hesi
tate to retaliate. - Â°
That view of the question has naturally caused a
go^d deal ol anxiety in Germany, as the people of the
empire as/ radically divided on the issue. The Agra
rians, or landowners and farmers, of Germany desire
fio'ection against the competition of Russia in farm
jrocucts, while on the other hand the manufacturers
would willingly grant almost free trade with Russia
in all iorts of farm products for the sake ,of getting
concessions in favor of German manufactured exports
to Russia.
In discussing the question Dr. Barth, one of the
leadng statesmen of Germany, is reported to have
said: "The recent Russo- American tariff war is of a
temporary nature, since Russia is systematically work
ing to "establish the closest rejations with the* United
The recent decree of the Russian Government im
posing a maximum duty upon American goods im
ported into Russia naturally constitutes the central
point around which the economic discussion revolves.
The decree does not impress Europe as it impressed
us. To the American the action taken by the Rus
sians appeared like the beginning of a European tariff
war against the United States. Some authorities who
Tike to prophesy did rot hesitate to declare that the
action would soon be followed by similar action on
the part of other European powers, and that the.
much-discussed plan of a general European tariff waf
against the competition of this country would soon be
carried out.
DESPITE royal deaths and weddings, the war in
South Africa and the complications in China,
the people of the leading nations of Europe are
directing attention mainly to industrial problems and
tariff questions. Economic issues, in fact, are the
most important of the time, and the nations are busily
engaged in determining how "each can best succeed in

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Â¦ Xow, -in the case of both deaf and blind, the earlier
they enter upon, systematic training the better. As a
frule it is aÂ° mistake, to keep either class long in .the
public .schools, and it will be a still graver mistake
to attempt to .give thenii in the public schools, the
special training* required- by their condition. If that
te Â¦ the object of the. bill it is without merit and
should, not. pass. Peisons who have never been in
contact with\hc blind and mute do not comprehend
tow slowly* and.' with what difficulty .they learn.
Therefore it' is .that the greatest caution is needful in
icrde'r that -their,, full training may not require them
io unlearn; 1 any" "part of : its earlier- stages.' The
process of ti:uÂ«arriing Js most difficult and to the stu
tfent most discouraging. These defectives keenly ap
preciate their condition and its limitations, and, mort
than the. whole,- they* -equi re constant and cheerful en
couraÂ£ement..\Vhen they have been mrstaught, which
it. the sure' results of attempting to teach them at all
Inj^h* public schools, and have to unlearn what has
bees acqu-rcd by, .so. much hard labor, they become
'discouraged, and their development is apt to be per
; ttanently irr.pcired. Ti the public would only* appre
.'ctate the obvious truth that what is learned with dif- '
Â°f:culty is ..still more : difficult -to unlearn, and would
Â¦ Â£pply that to the training of these defective children
Â¦they" would see how necessary'.it is ihat statutes affect
iri^ their welfare, to be beneficial, should originate
Â¦with these devoted experts who choose " for their
career the education of those who cannot be t trained
Â» in the public schools, else there would be no necessity
' for bsthntioris for the deaf and dumb and blind. That
â¢these exist 5 r.t all i.s'in itself evidence that the work
they do is a high and distinct "specialty.
Â¦ Turning X.3 the other side of it, the public schools
0 have row morc'wo-k than they do well for the
Â¦ non-defective classes. The ordinary teacher has
<*:e:thcr time nor training to teach the mute or the
b'ir.d. and the creation 6i special classes and employ
ment of 'special' teachers is not to be thought of, for
the juvenile blind and mute are not numerous, an i
when they occur only one or two will be found in
the same district, ani the employment of a special
teacher fcr them is a waste of money, energy and op

from/any .-.share of the public school funds and does
!riot propose, that it shall be under the management of

cajed. It is. hard. to tee just why the change is pro
jJQsed or. what good can come of it. The Berkeley

THE BLIND AND DEAT
It is not easy to imprison a mob made up of "best
citizens" and put it in jail until it give bonds to keep
the peace. 'In regard to that sort of violence there is
needed a new education of the people on the subject
of obedience to law. There is no land in the world
where violations of law by masses of the people is
less justifiable than in this country, for in no other
land have the people such ample powers in the way of
enforcing laws and controlling public officials. Con
sequently in all our- condemnation of Mrs. 1 Carrie
Nation let us not forget that she is a product of
American life and has had lots of examples to encour
age her in her violence.
The country will, however, lose the full significance
of the lesson of the Kansas outbreak if it confines
attentionjo Mrs. Nation and pronounces condemna
tion upon her alone. She has not been the only
supporter of lawless violence in this country, nor has
she been the worst. The' smashing of saloons is as
nothing compared with the gross outrages that have
been committed in the name of lynch law. That dread
evil has now become so common that it threatens
to develop into a habit, and, unfortunately, it is far
more difficult to deal with than Mrs. Xatign.
That calm statement of the responsibility of the
voters of Kansas for the violation of the law they
have enacted by the officials they elected may noc
have much effect upon the minds of excited zealots,
but it can hardly fail 10 impress the understanding of
the great mass of the Kansas people. The law is in
their hands, and so also are the officers of the law.
Those who desire to uphold prohibition in the Stat.2
have recourse to the courts and also to the 1 ballot.
It is therefore their own fault if the laws be violated,
and they cannot atone for that fault by what Justice
Brewer has called a "spasmodic virtue'' and described
as being "next door 10 intentional vice."
The hatchet Is the weapon of barbarism; the ballot
is the one weapon of civilization. In Kansas, since 1SS7,
Mrs. Nation, with* all the women in the 286 cities of
the State, has had the right to vote for Mayor, for the
members of the Common Council and for every other
officer of the municipality. Women, equally with men,
have the responsibility. Therefore, the duty of Mrs.
Nation and all the women-of Kansas Is to register and
vote for only such men or women who will publicly
pledge themselves to do their duty and to carefully re
tire to private life every officer who has failed to show
his hand.
â¢ Among the people who have been foremost ana
most emphatic in condemning the violent methods of
Uie Kansas crusader are many of the eminent leaders
of the temperance movement. Thus the venerable
Susan B. Anthony, whose zeal in the cause of woman
hood and the home, as well as in that of prohibition,
cannot be questioned, is reported to have said in a
recent interview:
Nothing of any permanent value has been gained
for the temperance cause in" Kansas her outbreak.
As Justice Brewer stated in a recent lecture at Yal=,
"I T<now that prohibition has ceased to be enforced
in the large cities of the State, but spasmodic virtue
is next door to intentional vice. After the spasm has
passed the community will be more indifferent than
ever, and within ten years it will be worse than it
was at first."
yy4 RS. CARRIE NATION, having been released
/ \ from jail, has decided to drop saloon-smash
* - ing for a time and edit a newspaper. It i9 re
ported she is to .receive $150 salary to conduct the
paper for a week. Perhaps the work will do the paper
good, perhaps it will do her good. One thing is cer
tain, it will do Kansas good, for while Mrs. Nation
is wrestling with the mysteries of the press and try
ing to write articles that will suit all classes of her
followers the excited people of Kansas will have time
to cool off and consider calmly the situation that con
fronts them.

IIâ GROWTH OF BUSINESS OP
PORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN.
In the solution of those problems which
rlso from the movement of American
.women toward economic independence the
leisure woman Â¦ r>t America must bear a |
yeoman's part. Sho it is who must study j
tho ever-shifting industrial situation, and, Â»
by Intelligent direction through press and j
people, strive to regulate conditions, adapt
public sentiment and remove the preju- j
dices of the worker, thus preventing con- I
srestlon in Industry, business or profession
by enabling women who need work to
pass easily from overcrowded fields of
labor to. others where their efforts are in
demand. â¢ j
The leisure woman of America mu3t do ;
thes.e things, and she must do them be-|
cause she is a leisure woman. Our bo- i
clal structure is to-day ao complex, our
processes are bo Involved, that the clos
est study of cause and effect is necessary
to the initiation of -any effort for social
control. The wisdom of the serpent and
tho patience of Job must waif upon the
formation and development of plans for
social betterment and progress.
Xow, all these things take time and
ptenty of it, and leisure women are the |
only people in America to-day who have (
any time at their disposal-. Men have
none and the higher up in the scale the
man is the less time he has. The 4,000,(XW
women who earn their livelihood in Amer
ica have no tlmet; they are as busy as the'
men. It Is clear that all the time there
Is lies in the possession of the women who
are supported by the labor of men, or are
in possession of sufficient means to render
labor on' their part unnecessary.
This absolute ''corner" on leisure prob
ably will not always exist; a time is com
ing when half the people will not have all
the leisure and the other half none. A
more ideal state cf society doubtless will
bring some work to everybody and not so
much work to anybody. In the meantime,
however, the burden of any social inves
tigation or endeavor in America must rest
with the leisure women. Half a million
of these 'leisure women are united in the
General Federation of Women's Clubs for
constructive social" work, and we shall ex
pect results from this concerted effort and
action.
Far from Its fcelng a fart-that the prob
lem of the worker is- alien- to the women's
clubs, I venture to say that the women's
clubs of America are rapidly becoming
the rallying ground for knowledge of and
interest in all phases of questions which
concern the woman who works. This is
true not alone because every club con
tains such able representatives of the I
professional, business an.d industrial ac- I
tlvltios of women, and thus affords a j
meeting ground for the leisure woman
and the wage-earning woman; it is true
even more because of the presence in the
clubs of a preponderating number of non
professional or leisure women who are to
play the most ' Important part in influ-, j
encing the future of the American, wage
earning woman. Even now the leisure 1
women of the- clubs are surveying the
field of the working woman arid noting
the opportunities nnd obstacles which
meet her there. Such social eff<*t will in
crease till at every step the leisure woman
blazes out the way' for the busy 'woman, j
The one class must do this for the other
class, because there is every reason why
the woman who works cannot do it for
herself.
Limitations of Women Who Work.
In the first place, she has not the time.
A woman who doe?, during six days in
the week, productive labor hns but little
leisure- in which to survey the field and
doduce conclusions from the phenomena
of which she is a part.
In the second place, the very fact that
she is herself a part of the subject matter
to be studied prevents the wage-earner
from having the best viewpoint from
which to regard the subject. From her
position in the thick of the fray trre wage
earnine; woman cannot discern the gen
eral movement of events nor form any
widely applicable deductions as to'steps In
the campaign. Yet the wisest and wariest
movements must be devised, for woman
as a wage-earner stands in the profes
sional, busincris and industrial world not
only without the recognition of the polit
ical* economist,- but without full popular
consent to her very existence there.
Scarcely a day passes without earnest ar
gument from some public quarter to con
vince, woman that it will not do for her to
become a w^ge-earner. Considering that
4.030,000 womc-p have wormed themselves
into lucrative employment in the United!
States, it seems hardly worth while to de
, bate the question as to whether they shall
or shall not work. Practically women
have settled the matter by working, but
theoretically the American public has not
made up a verdict. To be sure of this one
has only to note how many persons in de
manding opportunity for work for women
base the demand upon the fact that "so
many women, have Â»o work. 1 ' In the pop
ular mind necessity is the ground upon
which 'the right of women to work for
wages has been conceded. The ethical
right of every woman as an individual to
Â¦ some productive labor is yet an open
question with us in this country.
At this time we must leap this chasm of
the degree of right to remunerative. work
Â¦conceded to women and deal with the
facts as they actually existâ namely, that
women in great numbers are at workâ and
inquire into the opportunities and obsta
cles which they are encountering, particu
larly in the field ot business and in indus
trial pursuits. We Â¦'hall note as well, the
share which leisure women may have in'
I shaping their opportunities and removing
! the obstacles. Every section of our great
i and heterogeneous nation presents such
widely varying phases of this problem
that the ' value of any observations
thereon must depend entirely upon the de
gree of the observer's local familiarity
with the subject. I shall, therefore, con
fine myself in this paper to comments
upon conditions in the section which I
know best, and in speaking of the degree
of opportunity for women in business and
Industrial affairs shall treat of conditions
asÂ« they exist in.'the eastern group of the
Southern States. In any case this sub
ject as applied to the South would require
distinct treatment since the work of wo
men in this section presents phenomena
differing widely from, those of any other
part of tho country.
Business Opportunities in the South.
I It is easy to understand the reason of
j these peculiar conditions when we take
j into consideration the rapidity with which
i the wage-earning spirit has grown among
the women of the South, and rc'member
that in an incredibly short time from al
most no working 'women at all this sec
tion now finds itself possessed of them in
numbers equaling those of any other sec
tion. Even the field of stenographyâ that
most overcrowded of vocations â has been
open to women but a few short years in
the South. Â«Xo exact dates can be given
for a growth, but roughly speaking twelve
years would covfer the period during which
the nresence of women In offices -in any
capacity was- at all usual. I number
among my personal acquaintances a wo
man still of dancing age. who was for
years the only woman stenographer in
Atlanta, the least typically. Southern of
all Southern cities.-
Before office work came of course teach
ing, "which dees not "fall under the scopo
of this article, but which I mention here
because It was the entering wedge of
work for women, and for so many vears
after the Civil War constituted the* sole
resort of tbe needy gentlewoman. " So
many persons of irreproachable lineage
but worse than doubtful pedagogical at
tainments fell into this one open door for
fhose who "must Â°do something" that
school teaching was for many years a
Veritable slaughter of the innocents. It
still -ranks: as such an eminently respect
able means of; .earning , money, that it
draws many recruits from the elite, and
this renders it a tremendously over
crowded profession.
This constitutes my second reason for
alluding to ft here In connection with sten- (
ography, since these two vocations repre- 1
sent the grreatest state of congestion. Both j
are badly overcrowded with J-oung Â»o- j
men who should be doing some of the In- j
dustrial work which is Roin.er bogginp 1
while they struggle for poorer-paymp
places in schools or offices because such
work is more conventionally recognized
as the correct thing: for women.
Opportunities That Are Scorned.
Pitiful Industrial incongruities spring
from this state of affairs. Young women
in actual need will seek in vain a teach
er's place or pupils in music or art. or
struggle for a cheap position as stenog
rapher, while hundreds of women about
them are searching in vain, .for an intel
ligent person who can make a shirt waist
or cook or cator wlih skill. The objertloii
to domestic service, which exists every
where, rinds reintorctment in the wouiii
in the fact that the negro fills this field
absolutely. With IU.uCO.uOO persons of an
inferior race nearly all engaged In man
ual labor, it is easy to see how the door
of domestic service is shut uponfeven the
poorest whites. There " arÂ». however,
many branches of industrial labor which
do not fall under Uie head' of domestic
service in the sense vt requiring the em
ploye to enter the home of the employed.
Sewing supplies the most notable ex
ample of this kind cf and
next comes expert cookery which fur
nishes viands from outside the home. The
women's clubs of the South are making
great efforts through industrial training
schools for whites to popularize these In
dustries and attract to them some of the
young women who are overcrowding the
office and the schoolroom. In a far
reaching way this end will be effectuaUy
furthered by the movement for a more
and more general manual training feature
in popular education, for the acceptance
of which in the South women's clubs are '
largely responsible. . i
In Manufacturing Industries.
Passing from the industries which con
cern the home and which are as yet al
most totally undeveloped in the South, wa
come to the "tremendous field of manu
facturing industries. In the lower grades
of such work in the South women abound,
but they have not yet made the slightest
advance in position. This unopened field
Is perhaps the most important one for
whK-h the Southern woman waits. The |
textile industries alone of this section bid j
fair to challenge the wonder of the world.
Some Idea of the uc-velopment along this
line can be gathered from the fact that
during the last -fourteen years the con
sumption of cotton by Southern mills has
increased 297 per cent, against 20 per cent !
of- lnciea.se during the same period by ]
Eastern mills. During 1 the last year thir- I
ty-seven great cotton .mills were erected!
in the State of Georgia alone, and the
other Gulf States can show a somewhat
similar record. It Is easy to see what im
mense opportunities are opening: for those
who seek- work In the South, and since
negroes rarely work in factories this field
Is reserved almost exclusively for the
whites, as domestic service is for the
other race. ;
Let us see what share women are secur
, ing of this .fast-developing industry. In
: the lower grades of mill work they pre- |
Vonderate. being so greatly in demand at !
spindle and loom that 75 i>er cent of all j
the operatives In the mills of Georgia are >
women and children. .But this work Is j
always at the bottom. The good-paying
I ositior.s, such as forewomen in manu- j
lactuiing establishments, which North. ;
I-ast 'and West pive employment to ;
vomen of dignity and Intelligence, are â¢
unknown in the South. Since there i3
r.o prospect of their rising to share in i
the worK of superintendence the best |
class of women, from the point of view â¢
of industry and intelligence, do not go j
into the manufactories, or they leave
them as soon ns possible.
This fact -contributes to the congestion I
In ollice and schoolroom and swells the I
needy crowd of- applicants outside thetr
doors. Many women who are not parr
ticularly fitted for either the office or the
t-choolroom would be most successful
forewomen in manufacturing establish
ments.
Training Denied to "Women. .
That this great avenue of usefulness is
closed to Southern women Is partly due
tc precedent ffnd partly to the fact that
while textile training is given to the
young men of the various Southern States
who desire it all such opportunity Is de
nied to the young women.
I will again cite Georgia as the proud
possessor of. a school of technology of
almost uneijualed equipment ana effi
ciency, with a textile department which
matriculated more students last year than
f-ny other in th'e world. But its doors
are closed against the female citizens of
tht- State. Every step in the manufacture
of textiles is taught here,- from dyeing
' and designing to actual weaving, and if
women were permitted to share these
advantages there can be no doubt that
they would find greatly increased oppor
tunities for the exercise of skill and in
dustry. . . j,.
This discrimination against women will,
more effectually each year, forbid their
competition with men. for the better
grades of Industrial activity, since formal
training in the industries will become in
creasinRly demanded, and the boys of the
South will have all of it and the. girls will
have none. It is hardly necessary to say
that the club women <.f the South are agi
tating this question and will hammer at
these doors until they open. Bill^to this
tffect have been twice lost in Georgia's
Assembly, but there will be -other A^em"
blies, and the club women, who may be
counted on to be, always on, the alert,
will never rest until 'women are given
â¢ qual ppportunltles with men to share in
the higher grades of, industrial employ-,
ment. â¢ :;?â¢'-Â¦
Women Must Join Unions, r..
For those women, already fHling the fac-,
tories in such numbers there is much to
be done. The 75 per cent of women and.
children already in mills need the efforts
of the leisure women and are receiving
them. The first struggle must be. of
course, the effort to eliminate the children
from the problem. The Southern States,
which until recent years have teen purely
agricultural, have on their statute books
no labor legislation. An eleven-hour day
is about the limit, and, as for children,
they may work at any age, at the will of
idle parents.
To prevent this has been the object of
a fierce fight, now three years old. in the
various States, between the* mill owners
on the one hand and the tabor unions and
the women on the other. So far no leg
islation has been secured, but so much
popular sentiment has been aroused that
the mill owners are about to perfect an
agrtement among themselves conceding
a certain age limit and requiring a cer
tain amount of schooling for each child.
This is another, fight which will not bÂ©
dropped. o _ 3 ' ,
As for the factory woman and the la
boring woman everywhere there, is but
one sure reniedy for all the ills of her
condition, whether these ills he In the
Â¦ wa*:es for which she works or the circum
stances under which she works. That
remedy Is organization. It has proved
the effectual salvation of the laboring
man and It will do as much for the labor
ing woman. . Â° Â°
it is the function of the leisure woman
to press this truth hom? upon the woman
who worksoand help and . encourage her
to the formation and maintenance of
1 unions. Then she will not have to cut the
throats of. men by underbidding them, nor
live onÂ« Half wages because she la, a

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
Against the expressed will of the people Mr. To
bin pleaded the cause of "the gentlemen of wealth
and standing who have invested a large amount of
money in the racetrack."'
The matter is up to the Mayor. But he has already
declared in favor of "thirty days' pocket-picking," and
the extra six days of that industry, granted in the
thirty-six day ordinance, will probably not revolt him.
The issue was made, the people voted the pool
room down. If the Tobin ordinance to permit track
gambling had been submitted to them it would have
gone down with the pool-room;
Yet the Board of Supervisors not only invite it, but
hold the door open to it, notwithstanding that by
every possible form of expression, from the ballot-box
to the petition, the people have expressed themselves
against it. There was no evidence before the Super
visors that any considerable minority wants track
gambling. When the people rejected general pool
selling, off the track, in racing events, by what logic
can that decision be warped into an indorsement of
gambling on the track on the same events?
Legal protection of track gambling, and what the
Mayor admits to be pocket-picking, is something that
right-minded public officers would not need to.. refer
to the people at all, but would deny it at once. It is
one of the things condemned by the conscience, a
malurn in se. a wrong in itself, which governments
are instituted to forbid and not to invite.
It is well to emphasize now the attitude of these
public officers, for in due time they will be again cry
ing in the political wilderness that the charter is
about to perish for need of their friendly care and will
be extolling the sacredness of the popular will.
Yet those officers are the very same politicians who
were bowing to the ground in deference to the popu
lar voice. . Now what popular voice have they heard
in favor of track gambling? When and how was it
uttered? The issue was voted on by the people, and
their voice was overwhelmingly against renewal of
that form of vice. Has the Mayor .the veto power
over the popular vote? Can the Board of Super
visors reverse the judgment of the ballots? Are the
people the court below or the court above the Mayor
and his Supervisors? Which can reverse the other?
If the Mayor and Supervisors can reverse the ballots
of the people in such a matter as track gambling
they can in any other matter, and therefore can per
petuate themselves in power by ignoring the election
of their successors.
The present emergency in this city is an illustration
of the insincerity of those in authority. Decent peo
ple have hardly dared to sleep nights lest diversion
of their watchfulness from the Phelan government
may result in the re-establishment of track gambling
by the Mayor and Supervisors. .
The charter has proved no safeguard against the
evils it was advertised to cure, and its fate is another
added' to the long list of proofs that politicians who
do protest too much are to be distrusted, and that
good government depends not so much upon its form
but upon the character and unselfishness of its admin
istrators.
= "In the hands of its friends" the charter has come
to look as disreputable as a cast-off poultice in the
garbage box of a hospital.- Government under it has
been made costlier and less efficient than it was under
the consolidation act v.'hen administered by able and
public-spirited men.
Every pretended safeguard of the charter has been
breached by them, overleaped or undermined for the
purpose of playing personal politics or rewarding the
"push."
It is time to inquire whether their respect for the
public will was a sham to get favor and votes, or
whether their advocacy of direct legislation was fanat
ically honest. The evidence is decidedly in favor of
their hypocrisy. Populism and socialism had a few
votes to be caught 0:1 the initiative line, with referen
dum bait, and these politicians merely fished with that
tackle. Their idea of government seems to be that it
consists in trying to fool pirt of the people all the
time, trusting to the numbers of the indifferent to get
through successfully:
The party to which they belong made its last na
tional campaign on a platform that cried aloud for the
initiative and referendum, and would not be com
forted without those provisions for direct* legislation
and the immediate -impression of the people's will
upon the law and its enforcement.
/Vyi AYORPHELAN and the^men who are in
/ \ control of the present government of this city
* * were very influential in making the new char
ter. All of the peculiar features of that document are
due to their influence and advocacy.

The Supervisors then met as a commit
tee of the whole to discuss the water rate
question. A voluminous report from
Chief Engineer C E. Grunaky was on
motion of Supervisor P.eed ordered print
ed, so that tne members might have an
opportunity to read it at leisure. Grun
sky values the plant and properties of the

them at $15,000,000. The values of the

value - at $24,667,800 he admits that the
franchises and water rights owned by th*
Spring Valley Company have values that
would brine the : amount; nearer -to that
fixed by Engineer. Schussler. v
Further consideration of the lighting
question was then continued until to-mor
row afternoon, â¢ when it is probable that
the rate will be fixed. Some of the Super
visors are said to be in favor of making
a. cut to $1 35 a thousand cubic feet.
E. C. Jones, chief engineer of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company, was
equallv positive that' his company had no
interest in either the Central Light and
Power Company or the Equitable Gas
Company, i He explained that while his
company produced gas at a cost of forty
eight cents a thousand feet in the holder,
it cost more to distribute it, as the pipes
covered the whole city, while the other
companies are confined to small districts.
"These small companies have the cream
of the business," said Jones. "All that
we ask is a fair deal. Any rate lower
than ?1 40 a thousand cubic feet will be
unjust. We are now engaged in an un
healthy competition that is a serious
menace to our business." .
"Don't you know as a fact," asked the
Mayor, "that the San Francisco Gas Com
pany owns the controlling interest in the
Jfiquitable?"
"I know ns a fact that it does not," an
swered Naphtaly.
"I cannot," replied Naphtaly, "I know
nothing of the business affairs of that
company."
"You make a prortt of 30 cents a thou
sand cubic feet." remarked the Mayor.
"Can you explain to the Supervisors how
it is that the San Francisco Gas Company
claims that it cannot sell gas at less than
$1 40 a thousand cubic feet?"
"It costs us about 50 cents a thousand
feet in the holder and between 65 and 7U
cents in the burner."- . \ Â¦ .
"It is not,"' answered Pauson.
S. I*. Xaphtaly,' manager of the Equit
able Gas Company, was called. He tes
tified that the stock of the company Is
now S2lllng at from $3 to $4 a share, but
does not pay dividends, . as the earnings
and profits are being used to extend tne
plant. Xaphtaly satd that the company
cleared $32,WJ last year on aa Investment
of $304,000.
"At what price do you sell gas?" asked
the Mayor.
"One dollar a thousand cubic feet," was
the reply.
"What does it cost your company to
manufacture gas?"
"Is it not a fact," noxt asked the
Mayor, "that the 60,000 shares distributed
to the Central Light and Power Company
stockholders reaiiy belonged to the San
Francisco Gas aha Electric Light Com
pany?"
"They were not sold." replied the wit
ness. "They, were distributed among the
shareholders of the Central Light and
Pcwer Company as a dividend."
"When were they sold?"
"How many shares of the Equitable Gas
Light Company stock dGes the Central
Light and Power Company own?" asked
tne- Mayor.
'The company owned 60,000 shares at
one time," answered Pauson.
Jacob "W. Pauscn, secretary of the Cen
tral Light and Power Company, In answer
to questions asked by the Mayor, testi
fied that the company he represented is
selling light and power to the San Fran
clsco Gas and Electric Company. He
could not state how much power and light
the San Francisco Company bought, but
he estimated that the bills amounted to
between $4000 and J5000 a month.
The Board of Supervisors met in special
session yesterday afternoon and resumed
the Investigation being made preparatory
to fixing gas, electric light and water
rates for the coming year. When the
lighting matter was taken up Mayor Phe
lan called Supervisor. Hotallng to the

Captain Herbert, TVinslow of the United

defiantly refused to allow customs inspec

goodly quantity, has been indirectly re
proved by the Secretary of the Treasury
and must-submit to the Ignominy.
The auletus to the gallant naval ofneer
was given in a telegram received by Cus
toms Collector Straiton â¢ yesterday. It
reads as follovra:

Collector Stratton al once notified Cus
toms Surveyor BDear cf the order of the
Secretary and - furnished him vrith tho
necessary papers to enforce the authority
of the Collector, notwithstanding the pro
tests of the captain of the Solace. At 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon Deputy Sur
veyor St. John started for Mare Island
with eight = customs searchers to invade
the Solace and unearth whatever smug
gled goods there may be concealed upon
her. The search will be instituted this
morning and that it will be thorough go-?-*
without saying. Thero have been inter
cepted already on the way from the trans

containing dutiable goods. One small
package alone contained dutiable Jewelry
of the. value of $200.
Captain Winslow on Sunday declared
that he, could take his Bible, oath that
there were no dutiabie goods on board.
He has since then sworn off swearing.
There may be more Tabulation In store
for Captain ' Winslow.. The customs peopl.Â»
say that the discovery of the smuggled

Â¦ Presently, the Inequity cf keeping a man'*
contribution to the reserve on a policy which
had laoeed and ceased to' be a liability, and
the current cost of which while It waa in force
he had folly paid, began to be none clearly
*een and mere generally understood. "Non-
forfeiture" " became one of the etronrest com-
petitive attractions. Companies vied with each
ITon-Forfeiture.
In'.rlew of the lack ocf experience and the
rrr.ail amount cf business, aad following again
Ergllsh precedent, Cl\ider.<!s were made only
Â¦it.'' the". end c of five-year periods, or wera not
Â¦begun on' any policy until It had run. flve
jrars. T*e profits froia forfeitures, the -high
ravis of Snterest andÂ° the tarings from the low
cxper.ee rate,_ all contributed, in the carefully
managed companies, to make the dividends
unexpectedly Janfe. It wu not many years
before ar-irial dividends became the general
practice. â¢
Tifty-flve years ego there was no local busl-
r.ees experience to be. puided by. -The com-
rades organized etxrut th'at time took as a

creased our surplus from $4,557,977 91 to J7.131.-

rcason of our few lapses and the persistence of
our policy-holders, our business has attained an
average age far greater than that of the de-
ferred dividend companies, with their enor-
mous lapses.- our mortality has been Tar Insld's
that predicted by oiir tables and which ,we were
prepared to meet. , Â¦
That !s. not the kind of "dry rot" that de-
stroys its victim or impairs its .vitality, i , It
seems more a process of sound growth and
fruitrulness than that of decay. It is not the
size of the comrany, but what it -dees, for its
policy-holders that most concerns them. We
have not been racers for size; we have strlvei.

absolute stability and for the accomplishment
of the highest results to our policy-holders.

creasing the cost of our policies either to the

The Tide Turned.
As a device for invsstment the scheme has
failed; as a device for cheapening the Insur-
ance of even those wbo live to test the hope
deferred it has failed. For the simple annual
dividends of the Connecticut Mutual, with no
speculation ; in them, 'tire exceeding the . out-
come of the estimates; and no man's surplus
and.no family's paid-up insurance has been
taken to do it with. Let an example serve:
Fifteen years ago one of- the deferred dividend
companies issued a $10,000 fifteen-year endow-
ment policy, at- age VÂ». at a premium of JC7S Â»O,
on an estirrtate that the dividend would- be
$49S0. In its settlement. Just made, the divi-
dend, was only $2010. Was It worth while, for
this 40 per cent of &n estimate, to run the
risk for fifteen years cf losing all? The same
year The Connecticut Mutual issued a policy of
the same kind, amount, at same age, at a
premium of $6S9 00. annual dividends, which
the insured > preferred to leave with the com-
pany to accumulate until his policy should
mature. His dividend. Just paid, is $3163 SO;
and neither It nor his policy has been at the
risk of forfeiture. * Â¦- "
Failure of the "Investment."
And all this was not without "effect. It
hindered our business. From 1874 to 1SS5 our
amount at risk declined from $1S5,36Â«,633 to
flSl.301.SS8 before the tide turned. "Dry rot"
was alleged to have set in, and the extinction
of the company to be in sight. > Meantime we
went on educating a clientage to the I Idea of
Insurance for Its own sake and at | Its lowest
cost, recast our ; premiums . and : reserves for
new business on a 3 . per cent* interest basis
in â¢ 1882. and H were laughed ; at for itâ though
all ): are >. now - following ; that Â¦ leadâ bided v our
time, and â¢ waited : for the . results of j long de-
ferred dividends to appear; and they have ap-
peared as already, narrated, in a steadily: dim-
inishing stream.
Effect on Our Business.
Even ." the extraordinary persistency with
which our policy-holders have continued on
has been, ignorantly perhaps, alleged as" a
danger because older men die faster than
younger; as if the calculations of all com-
panies rnuat net and did not amply, provide
for the' whole mortality of its membership
and not merely for the younger or middle-
aged part of it. ' ... y
It is In the great multitude of lapses and
surrenders that' the companies offering "In-
vestments" ' hops for a. profit; it is by the
staying solidity of our membership that we
can get those best results which we seek.
However . agents of I other companies might
strive against each other they have Joined to
atuck The Connecticut Mutual. Insinuation,
depreciation, slander, can do In a moment
and by a word that which much time and
many v.-orda may fall to undo. The abundant
defamatory literature > of other companies has
been supplemented by the highly paid services
of certain Insurance Journals.
The position so steadfastly held by us and
the t ffoi ts we have made from year to year to
net forth the simple truth and expose the true
character and evil cttsct of the demoraliza-
tion whose growth Â¦ v-e have here sketched,
have, ac a matter of course, brought upon
us criticism and misrepresentation without
stint. Success In setting business by esti-
mates, which have-not been half fulfilled, has
been cited, as the complete Justification of that
method. In the heat ot" speculative competition
we have been labeled with every epithet sig-
nifying want of enterprise, ultra conservatism
and lack of the modern spirit.
Adverse Criticism.
The Difficulties of Our Course.
It must not be supposed that the maintenance
of our position In all these matters has been
free from 'difficulty. The high commissions of
those companies have tempted away many of
our former agents and made It the more diffi-
cult to get others. Our agents with fair com-
missions, with no margin In them for rebating,
have, worked up business only to see it taken
irom them by men whoso commissions and al-
lowances are such that they can rebate from
60 to 100 per cent of the premium, and yet have
enough left to compensate their work. But,
happily, we have been able to get and to hold
as agents the men who take their work so seri-
ously that they will not tempt their client to
speculate In his family's protection, or, for
higher pay, place him where his policy will
cost him more than it ought.
We have refused to compete In this way. In
order to maintain the low standard of cost to
the great body of pollcy-hoHers we already
havÂ» we have kept expenses down to the old
standard, and added only such business as
could be l;sd on the came terms.
One of the moat striking Incidents of the last
thirty years has bÂ«en that general and exten-
sive reduction of expenses in all commercial,
manufacturing, transportation and other enter-
prises, by which only have these enterprises
been ab'e to prosper in face of an unprecedent-
ed competition. Present profits are largely, and
often entirely, savings ,by reductions from
former expenses. Lowtr cost Is the strongest
factor In general business competition. So It
should be in life insurance, of all things. But
so It is not. The expense account of the com-
panies pushing the deferred dividend invest-
ment schemes is from twice to three times the
former. standard of the most prudently managed
companies. But, the dividend thereby affected
being so long put off, the fact passes long un-
noticed. When at last settling day comes, the
striking failure of the dividend to realize the
estimate Is explained on other grounds than
high commissions and expenses.
Insurance.
Holding such views, cur course has not been
optional. Our duty has been not to offer some-
thing else than fue life insurance on its own
right lines becauEe it could easily be made
popular, but to try to make the true thing
popular by telling the whole truth about I!,
by administering it in its true spirit, working
out Its own proper results in our own company
and letting these stand in Judgment against
the results of the expensive "investment" spec-
ulations. We have appealed oniy to those who
desire life Insurance only for the protection it
gives and not for the speculation that can be
made of It. Therefore have we refused to fol-
low any of th; methods of the speculators. Such
changes in policy plans and conditions as ex-
perience has shown to be. desirable have been
freely made. Every condition not found to be
necessary to the proper' protection of honest
men and the soundness of the company has
been eliminated. But we have not built with
onÂ« hand and with the other prepared the way
to tear down." The Connecticut Mutual remains
a lite insurance company.
Expenses Cut in All Business but Life
Reason of Our Own Course.
The annual dlvlfl?nd Is a steady and powerful
incentive to prudence and economy. The de-
ferred dividend gives a wide and long opptrtu-
nlty for the extravagance and consequent high
cost which it was originally Invented to con-
ceal, and which have been further enhance.! .fry
the rivalry made possible by taking some of the
deferred dividend material to use in more vig-
orous pushins for business.
Annual dividends put the management cf a
company to a constant test. Deferred dividends
put eff that test to the end of a long period of
years. By. annual dividends a man knows all
the time just what his insurance is costing
him. With deferred dividends he cannot know
what its cost is until the end of the period. If
he llvo? and holds on; but if he dies before that
time it will have cost him too much by UiÂ»
amount of surplus forfeited, and if he lapses
it will have cost him too much by the amount
of surplus forfeited and also by the amount
of reserve forfeited to stlil further Increase the
surplus.
What Deferred Dividends Conceal.
The only proper reason for deferring divi-
dends Is either that there is nothing to divide
or that there Is something in the condition uf
the company or its business which renders a
division hlshly Inexpedient.
The cost of the protection to the man paying
for It is the difference between the premium
charged on the face of his policy and the sur-
plus returned to him. In this adjustment he
pays his actual share of the mortality and ex-
penses, and is credited with his share of an/
surplus Interest earnings. The savings from
mortality, expense* and Interest are determined
each year. Each year the company knows Just
what his risk has cost them to carry; therefore
each year the man -should pay that cost and no
more. In other words, as the cost of each pol-
icy is annually determined the surplus. If there
is any safely divisible, should be annually ro-
turned, so that only the actual annual cost is
annually paid.
Annual Dividends, and Why.
These things are axiomatic, and certain defin-
ite and indisputable propositions grow out of
them. Our policies should be framed In every
detail to give the protection intended 4o? those
for whom it is Intended. They should not set
up a scheme of speculation in the forfeiture oÂ£
that protection by those dependent 'on It, nor of
his payments by the man who has paid for it.,
The Inducement to a policy should be the pro-
tection it offers; the motive in taking it should
be the faithful performance of his "unavoidable
duty by him who has made others dependent on
his life. ' Business should be gotten by educat-
ing men to this standard of duty and of Its
performance, and not by changing the busine^
into something else and something which ap-
peals to selfish Interest first and leaves duty to
take its slender chance in a flve to twenty year
lottery.. .
It ha3 held to the cardinal facts: Life insur-
ance is for the protection of those dependent
on a man's life; their dependence makes it his
unavoidable duty. Those dependents we assume
to protect by our contract, at his personal cost;
our duty to them Is to make that protection as
large, as- secure and ns certainly available to
therr as poss'ible; our duty to him is to make its
cast to him aa small as possible.
During all the long struggle out of which this
situation has developed, and amid the many
fichemes devised to attract public attention and
favor to something else than life insurance, the
attitude and position of The Connecticut Mu-
tual has never been doubtful. â¢ ? r . : Â¦
offer him every facility to sacrifice to his
personal j convenience as large a part of. his
family's protection as he can borrow; and, to
crown all; 1 the fight between the- companies
which do all these things is made mainly by
"rebates" -of premium*, carried to such a
degree that devices are now ' being adopted
which may, enable a company to dispense with
any legal reserve liability;, for the first year,
leaving almost the entire first year's premium
available for expenses; a device which can be
extended to any number of subsequent pre-
miums when the exigencies of competition,
which have caused its use to the extent of one
premium, shall have so grown by what they
haveflfed upen as to require an absorption of
more."

In 1S7J they somewhat moderated their esti-
mate and put It at $S31 70; tout they paid only
$37> 70 at the end of the twenty years in 1S33.
They continued to make thls*same estimate
until 1S7S, when they again reduced it to $523 70;
they used the eame estimate, $Â«3 70 in 18S1.
and are paying In 1S01 oaly $257 70. The differ-
ence* between estimates and actual dividends
in the ten and fifteen rear postponements are
etill more striking.
As we have seen, r the calculations in 1871, in
the example taken, "promised a dividend in 1S91
of $1135 24. But the 1S91 result was only $433 79.
The -details of their failure are extremely in-
teresting.
Estimates and Results Compared.
But the- wisdom of estimates has not bÂ»en al-
together JustiJW of her children. The rivalry
of the speculating companies in their etrug-Ie
for pre-eminence has led them to an unheard-
of expense. They have written an enormous
amount cf business; thousands of millions of
insurance have been lapsed as expected; hun-
dreds of millions of reserves and accrued sur-
plus have been forfeited as was hoped, nut
so much has been absorbed by hi^h commis-
sions to agents, by rebates and the many ex-
penses incident to an abnormal rivalry, that
the expected results have not appeared;, to this
the\ decline in Interest has contributed some-
thing, but comparatively little.
Estimates Fail and Why.
-Agents no longer presented life insurance for
the protection of families, but estimates of "in-
venmentÂ«" for the policy-holder himself. The
larger the estimate thÂ« more eagerly It was
taken. Success made the companies promoting
the .scheme very aggressive. Instead of a
struggle for existence It beoame a race for size.
Iloets of agfnts wÂ«-e employed to do the easy
work of selling a rr>ecu:atlon based on seem-
ingly rcientifle figures. The scheme took ho
widely that for a time it threatened to com-
pletely supp'ent and drive out true life insur-
ance administered to Its own proper ends. So
easily was it worked that gradually, one after
another, most of the companies followed more
cr ten completely jn the wake of the originat-
ors of the â¢Chan*, until "Investment" insur-
ance, depending for the "investment" on the
forfeitures to be made during the period of
-^..tponement" of dividends, is the dominant
feature with most companies. Their contracts
ar* no longer termed "policies." but are
"bands/' "gold bonds." "contracts of eale "
"debeature*.": etc At bottom they are all cne
thing. The dividend Is postponed on the in-
ducement that by the forfeitures of the unlucky
many, in the meantime the returns to thÂ» lucliy
few may be correspondingly larce. '
The forecast was correct. People could not Et
once turn back upon all their convictions and
tense of Justice. But the glittering estimates
won their way, ar.d men put their own pay-
ments and the rrotÂ«Â»ctlon of their families at
the hazard of the game for ten to twenty years,
with the distinct agreement, still in use, that
no accounting Fha'.l bÂ«- made; each Irs to accept
as his true share.' ard without question, what-
ever in then allotted to him.
Its Popularity.
It was a bold scheme. The public has 1jst
been thorouchly educated to believe that surh
forfeitures were a gross injustice ani hardship
to the ro!':Cj--hf>Mer, whese payments were thus
confiscated, and to h!s family, which ne^ie.J
the protection of the paid-up insurance which
his forfeitures would otherwise have purchased.
ThÂ« Injustice was palpable and perfectly un-
necessary in any healthy company. The hau'.-
ehlp was often notorious and severe, and none
had been noisier prophets of "equity" than
these very companies which now invited men
to take their two chances out of three of kp-
ing all for the one chance In three of getting
Â»o treat a slice of the fruits of the inequity
v.-hirh they had loudly condemned as Immoral
and cruel. The scheme was offered In the be-
lief that with very many the Immorality ni:d
cruelty would be lost sight cf if a sufficiently
brilliant speculation in their profits was pre-
eeated.'
The Attraction.
So it was proposed that persons insuring
ehould agree that fcr, say twenty years, they
shculd have no <liv1<ler.ds; that whoever lapsed
his policy during this period should forfeit to
the company all his contributions to reserve
and all the Furplus which had accrued from, his
premiums, and that In ca.Â«e of those who ill-Â»d
only the face of the policy should he paid, and
whatever surplus had accrued should he for-
feited to the comrany: that these forfeited re-
serves and surpluses should be put in a fund
apart until the er.d cf the twenty years .and
then divided among those then alive and still
ii/rured.
They calculated that with 1000 persons, aged
IT. insured for $1000 each, on an annual prem-
ium of ?*S 17, the forfeited reserves and j sur-
pluses of the 544 lapsing policy holders and the
forfeited surpluses of the 1C3 who died would,
at the end of twenty years, amount, with in-
terest, to $4^),7Tj 77. to be divided among the S53
â¢uppored to lie then alive and still insured,' giv-
ing each cr.e S1135 34â just about double what
each had paid for premiums during the twenty
years, not counting Interest. And they sot
emlnept actuaries to indorse the estimate.
For a typical example: Taking 1C00 persons.
Injuring at age 37. they calculated that in
twenty year? 544 would at one time or another
larse ar.d US would die. leaving only 3o3 still

Scheme Based on Forfeitures.
Motive for New Schemes. â¢
Conspicuous among the competitors of that
tira4 were certain companies which were trying
to'tRsht their wpy to the front by such high
commissions and other considerations to.
trents as should draw them, away from the
more conservative companies, and so build up
agfney forces that should dominate the field.
Put the'.r high expenses made such low divi-
dends where those equaling the better com-
panies had been premised that no agency force
could hold their policy-holders, and their busi-
ness betran to decline with alarming rapidity.
The high expenses could net be gotten rid
of without o;f*s!nff th* agent*. There was for
them no ot\Â»r attraction. Therefore, the only
ffcape from thÂ» fate of so many others lay In
some schrrr.e to get the dividend question out
of .the way for at least a long time; such a
scheme was soon found.
The r r *vi'' i; J s decade had seen the formation
ef a multitude of new companies which copied
the plans of the rider ones and. promised to
repeat thpir success. But. In order to attract
acent* and get busln* fs. they found or fÂ»lt
themselves cfmi^Hed to pay puch commissions
to nrcats. nnd to Incur such other expenses,
as to absorb, not only all their surplus, but so
much of thÂ»tr reserves as to pÂ»nd the moat cf
th<Â»m Into bankruptcy. In the. late '80's the
cry had been that no properly organized life
insurance company could fall. The early "id's
showed that conduct was quite aa vital as
organization; end that' the expense account
could bleed to death the most correctly organ-
ized concerns, and they died by the d'bien.
New Departures.
"As an alternative to annual premium pay-
ments .d-jrir.g life, rates were made for the
rj.yir.tnt of all premiums in a limited period
of ream, as. ten. fifteen, etc., while the policy
covered the whole term of life.
Ufe endowment policies were Introduced, to
cover a certain term of years as an insurance.
*nd payable at their face value at the
end of the term If the Insured survived it.
Where the policy term was long enough to
cover tht period of life when one has others
dependent oh him. and the policy-holder was
so young at the outset as to make the endow-
ment part of his premium comparatively Email.
and so Ions as the companies kept their ex-
l>enws down, this kind of policies served a
fairly good purpose, although the endowment
feature costs much mere in a life' insurance
company than in a savings bank, because of
the much higher rate of general expense.
Along theee ceneral 1!d<-s. which, within
Judicious limits, were mostly lines of distinct
improvement, the development went on with-
out any striking divergence from certain ln-
dlMmtabl* universally accepted principles gov-
erning sound and equitable practice, until
about 1S70.
Changes in Plans and Premiums.
ctber In doing "equity" to a lapsing policy-
holder. â¢ Â¦;:Â¦â¢'Â¦ -f
Out cf all this the situation as respects the
life Insurance business â that which is offered
the public in its name and the -methods by
which business is promoted, by a great ma-
jority of the companiesâ has developed Into
this: There is practically no attempt to sell
life Insurance as euch and at annual cost; It
Is not offered unless men Insist upon having
it, and the agent gets but a very small com-
mission for selling It:, the companies push and
pay the high commissions for. some eort of
"Investment" bond or contract; the essential
feature of the Investment Is the forfeitures
which can be worked into it. This takes time;
eo dividends are deferred for five, ten or
twenty yearsâ the longer deferred the" higher
the commission â In order to secure as many
forfeitures as possible. All contract safe-
guards against even wholesale frauds are
practically abolished, and the protection of
honest policy-holders is left to what the
various courts may regard as expedient for
public morality. The companies are, : by the
annual cash value, putting their corporate | in-
tegrity and the validity of therr '. Insurance
contracts completely at the. mercy of those
who, for personal convenience or_ in a; panic,
may wish to withdraw, taking with , them the
good lives which give a safe average mortality
and the funds which alone make the Insurance
contracts secure. By "loans on policies,"
which are rarely paid by the borrower, â¢ they
Present Status of Competition.
For Instance: A man Insured at 25 for $10,000.
v.-lth an annual premium of about $215. would
pay for forty years before he could borrow
$5030. His policy would then be virtually cut
in two, but he would still pay his $215 and
5 per cent interest in advanceâ $233 .moreâ In
order to get his reserve back Into his own
pocket; and when, as is often the case, tiring
of this, he gives up altogether thero Is little
or nothing left to give his family paid up
insur5r.ee. which, but for the loan, would
probably have asriounted to $7000 or $8000.
Another and kindred liberality is "loans" on
policies, by which the policy-holder has the
privilege to borrow his contribution to the re-
serve, pledging his policy aa collateral, paying
or noupaylng his debt as he pleases, and he
rereiy pleaecs to pay. This was adopted to
meet the stock argument of the assessment
companies â that a man should pay each year
only the mortality cost for that year and keep
the reserve In his own pocket.
This again Is a seeming liberality to the
policy-holder, but not to the family out of
whose policy the loan must finally be paid.
No one who has seen the hardships and the
disappointments to families caused by such
settlements can covet the task of having to
make them; no man who stops to realize what
it means to hl3 family can willingly leave such
a ehadow on hU memory. Life insurance is
a sacrifice of one's self for the imperative
and unavoidable duty he owes his family.
Loans and cash values are the sacrifice of his
family for himself.
The liberality to the policy-holder himself
is less than it is made to seem. Under the
usual forms of policies the reserve increasps
so slowly .that no coneiderable sum could be
borrowed until after many years.
Loans on Policies.
The whole theory of life Insurance and all
its calculations are bared on the duration of
its insurance contracts to natural maturity.
Onl> so can it fulfill its special purpose, secure
that average exj>erlence which gives security
to its undertakings, protect Itself against
those fluctuations of mortality and In general
financial conditions which might otherwise be
destructive of a company's existence; and only
no can the business be handled In a manner to
give the lowest cost. The annual cash value
makes It possible to wreck cr cripple a com-
rany In a year. Its policy-holders may all
withdraw, or so many of Its healthiest lives
may withdraw, taking Its quickest and best
assets, leaving only impaired lives to cause an
abnormal death loss to be met with reduced in-
come ani poorer assets, as to leave it unable
to continue business with advantage or even
B&fetjV - That Is no true liberality to those
whom life insurance undertakes to protect, for
whom it was created and for whom It should
be administered. Life insurance companies
cannot serve as savings banks without danger
of destruction or of serious Impairment in effi-
ciency for their own special purpose. However
willing they may be to take up their policies
for cash when the conditions make it conveni-
ent and tare to do so, an agreement to do it
at any time and under any tonditlcns adds a
deepest element of danger to the 1 future.
Another liberality ir the "annual cash value."
by which cne may, any year, demand back
from thÂ» cempany his contribution to the r<-
Eerve", thus at v.ill changing the transaction
from insurance to a savings bank deposit.
Annual Cash Values.
Another liberality Is permission to destroy
onÂ»'s self in any manner and make the rest
pay for it. No company would, in theee days

cidc wluch was, undor any fair presumption,
the legitimate outcome of disease. But the
cowardly suicide of a fane manâ and there ate
many of themâ ia a distinct frau.l against men
Â¦who have the courase to live, and the honor to
fight the battle of life fairly, and stay by their
lamllies.
Liberality as to Self-Destruction.
There is, however, such a thing as "public
morals" and a "public policy" In regard
thereto; and the courts are In the habit of
regarding fraud and contracts permitting
fraud as offenses against public morals, and
forbidden by public policy, and of dealing wlih
cases of fraud accordingly; and it Is not prob-
able that. In the end. fraud in life Insurance
will be found to be less fraudulent, more laud-
able, or more conducive to commercial and
public . morality that fraud In any othex mat-
ter. If the courts permit it in life insurance,
they must permit it in all transactions. They
can permit it in any care only if there it no dif-
ference between right and wrong, and if the
truth and \ lie are of equal moral and com-
mercial value, and of equal safety for the
public. Permission to any fraud is an invi-
tation to all fraud.
Will Courts Permit FraudP
The first "liberality" proposed was that If
a man could conceal his deception for a year
or two. or thre*?, his policy should be "incon-
testable." no matter how gross the fraud.
Rivalry has caused such liberality that now
some companies call their policies incontestable
from the very outset; if the deception once
passes muster its later discovery will be dis-
regarded.
Incontestability.
Â¦Another means of stimulating busings has
been the rivalry in "liberality." It beftan in
dropping imoreor less of the defenses against
fraud. Fraud may be committed In two ways:
The applicant may deceive the. company by-
false statements as to his .family or personal
hif-tory. habits of life, present .condition, etc.
so that It Issues Us contract when . it would
not have dene so had It known the truth, or
Issues It at a different rate from what It would
have charged had the' real risk been disclosed;
or, he may willfully destroy hi? own 'life. caus-
ing less when there should have been none. All
these things, If successful, cost; and the cost
Is borne by the policy-holders who do not de-
ceive and do not willfully destroy themselves.
It Is therefore the duty of a company's man-
agprs to protect honest policy-holders against
such frauds and losses. When one is asked to
make a contract based on the statements of
the other party to it. he has a right to know
the truth of them and to be absolved from his
promise If they prove to be false. That is the
simplest equity and morality. That is the rule
in even* other kind of contract.
Competition by Liberality.
Agents have been attracted and stimulated
by commissions and allowances from two to
five times what they were thirty 'years ago,
and have, in their turn, used these to stimu-
late the public by giving away in "rebates" *a
new blood whatever was necessary to secure it,
until. In many of the companies, a new insurer
can getâ ir he stands out fcr Itâ a rebate of
from Â£0 to 300 per cent of his premium, drop his
policy at the end of the year," go to another
rival and repeat the procers each year, eo lcng
as he Is willing to take the risk of being abje
to rass a new examination.
This makes business easy to get but hard to
kfep, as the lapses of such. companies show.
Commissions and Rebates.
Much criticism of the forfeiture Investment
schemes, as a gross injustice alike to policy-
holder and beneficiary has led the companies
to adopt forms of contract as remote as pes-
elble from life Insurance, policies in form, and
called by every sort of name suggesting "In-
vestment" instead of insurance.

'.In-. In .London was 10s better, with spot cloc
in?, at - Â£121 17s Cd and futures at Â£116 10s,
owing <o light Â§peculative manipulation, the
local market for tin went off 25 points and
ruled quite weak throughout the session, partly
due to an absence of speculative Interest and
partly to the heavy arrivals at this port of
late. Th<> close -was easy at J25 SOJi'26 80. Lead
in I^ondon rrached the lowest level for many
.years., when .It touched Â£13 > 17s fid. at which

ever, lead was dull and unchanged at $4 374,
with sales of small lots reported at that price.

Amerlcan Hoop benefited by the operation,
while' Steel 'and Wire was a sufferer. But lt
was evident that the insiders who have had
time for mature calculation had done their
Â¦buying, while the outsiders were not inclined to
Jump at conclusions In so vast a problem. As
all 'of the stocks get from par to 125 per cent
of the new securities in the exchange, with ad
ditional' benefits in some cases, it is clear that
on a â¢ basis of equal value for the properties
concerned in tha consolidation, the highest
priced Is National. Tube, which said last night
at- 106. while the lowest is American Hoop,
which nold last night at S34- Of the common
stocks, the highest is Tinplate, which sold last
night at C?. and the lowest is American Hoop,
which soM at "5.
i StI Paul was the most notable example of
strength, rising at one time 54 points over last
night. The Southern Railway stocks, Missouri
Peclflc and the Pacific and Western Railroad
stocks generally gave evidence of firmness.
Testerday's strength In the tobacco Mocks con
tlnacd. American Tobacco rising 3. Of the steel
stocks, fiteel and Wire was most under pres
sure, dropping at the last 44 below last night,
after being vigorously Rupported about 41 Tin
plate got back to last Thursday's closing level
but rallied a point, showing a net loss of 4.
National Tube Is 34 lower and the preferred 3
lower than last r.ight. Federal Steel lost 2U-
American Hood and the National Steel stocks
are the only ones that do not fhow losses.
Rullroad bonds tended lower in sympathy
with stocks. Total sales, par value, J2.610.00O.

i ly announced were found Jn several cases to
I closely conform to the conjectural features
which have been current for eeveral days past.
WJth.- the exception of an upward dash In one
if- two of the steel stocks Just at the opening,
thsrÂ« was no strength manifest in the group
during ! the day. It was a few minutes after

CLOSING.
On the markets here to-day business was
slack, the settlement being in progress and
money momentarily tight. Americans were de
preFfed on unloading by dealers who had
bought freely, expecting a rise after the New
York holidays. The close was at the worst.
A sharp spurt was given in the street. St.
Paul leading on reports of an increase of the
dividend. ThÂ« advance did not last long, how
ever. Money rates were unaltered. The bank
continues doing the bulk of business, both in
loans and discounts.

were named on the ticket. Although there
were but seven candidates to, be voted for,
many voters "plumped." Under the eight
hour law of voting, time was taken ea.sily,i
From 1 to 9 p. m. Judges Henry, Root,
James M. Kelly and David- Kerr watched
the ballot box. Robert Colqhoun repre
sented the institute and took good care
that nobody voted who had not paid up
hi? duos to date. The clerks of election
were J. C. Saulmann and . Frank T.
Doolan.
The candidates for trustees were:
William A. Beatty, attorney-at-law,
Bffe Deposit building: Alpheus Bull, me
chanical draughtsman, 315 Howard street;
G. L. Center, real estate, 2S2S Sixteenth

Otto von Geldern, civil engineer, 819 Mar
ket street; Luther 'Wagoner, civil and
mining engineer. S49 Chestnut street: Hor
ace Wilson, secretary J. D. Maxwell Com
pany, 421 California street.
As to the eligibility of Beatty and
Spauldlng a question was raised. It was
said that they had not been members long
enough. to entitle them to run for offlcÂ«Â».
The right of equal suffrage was exempli,
lied by the number of women who voted.
No tally of sex was kept, but it seems
that the electoral privilege was not exer
cised by the. ladles as fully as it might
have been, because they were chary of
their rights. , . - *
The following: was the vote cast for
each candidate: Beatty 327, Bull 404, Cen

Neal 282, Spaulding 337, Von Geldern 295,
Wagoner 323. Wllpon 276.
A total of &27 votes was cast and the
early returns indicated the election .of
Beatty, Bull, Day, SpauUling,"Von Geld

The members of St. John's Episcopal
Church have been startled by the discov
ery of an attempt to burn their edifice,
which stands at the Bouthwest corner of
Grove and Eighth streets. The startling
attempt at incendiarism was uncovered
this morning.
Sexton Sherwood found the charred re
mains of a mass of burnt paper covering
the steps -leading into the rector's study
at the rear of the church. The blackened
supports to- the railing of the stairway
showed where the biaze had' started and
by some fortunate circumstance had been
extinguished "before it .got' under headway
far enough* to sweep through the large
frame structure." Â¦
Â¦Although '.the damage from the fire was
nominal, -the surrounding circumstances
have -caused a profound sensation among
the members of the congregation. â¢ Every
offort- is being made to prevent publicity,
us the- church- ofiicers believe*, according
to the -statements of Sherwood, that they
can put their hands upon the ..responslMe
person; ' . , â¢â¢ Â¦/- :'Â¦:Â¦.

ducted-during I>nt. " It was shortly after
daybreak: and he did not at first observe
the - remains- of -the paper.' As light
dawned .the -sexton -noticed' the unusual
debris arid while he was stirring among
the burned bit? of paper he. noticed the

No More Bodies Cast Up.
No more bodies were recovered vester
day from the wreck of the Rio. Shortly
before sunset two ladles at the Cliff House
saw. a body on the Seai Rocks. Word was
telephoned to Catitaln Hodgson and the
lifeboat was quickly launched. By the time
the life-savers reached the Seal Rocks
the sun had gone dov/n and the body had
been carried out to s?a by the tide. Look
out Hyslop of the Merchants' Excnange
states that through his powerful marine
glass he could see that the body was that
of a woman with long black hair. A life 7
belt . was tied around tnÂ» waist . of the
corpse. It is expected Ihat fishermen will
be able to recover the body to-day.
~A pathetic incident of the wreck was
disclosed yesterday by the postal authori
ties, who had discovered a letter in a sack
of newspaper mall. It had evidently been
written on board the steamer and was ad
dressed to Master R. Wildman. The letter
was as follows:

afternoon at 4 o'clock. Yours lovingly.
Â¦ KATIE.
The letter was an evidence of the popu
larity of the little son of the late Consul
Wildman with the lady passengers of the
Rio.
The following dispatch was received last
nl^htr
SANTA ROSA. Feb. 26.-Grave fears are en
tertained here that Miss Maud Culver, daugh
ter . of J. W. Culver of this city, was amon*
those lost on the ill-fated steamshlD Rio de Ja
neiro. For several months past the young lady
lias been visiting- In Honolulu and Intended re
turning either on the Rio or the Coptic. The
latter has arrived, but brougjit no -word. Her
friends and relatives are naturally greatly ex-
Jrelsed. Â¦- . . ..... -, .
-Miss Culvers name coes not appear in
the passenger list of the Rio de Janeiro
and Dr. O'Neill did not,, remember any
such name when he made out a list of the
passengers last Friday. ; It Is possible
that the young lady- purchased a purser's
ticket when the Rio sailed from Honolulu.
TO CELEBRATE THEIR ANNIVERS ARTâ
Invitations have been issued for the twenty
eeeond anniversary ball and celebration of the
Austrian' Military, and Benevolent Association,
which, will be held next Saturday evening at
California Hall. 620 Bush street. In the early

"When T heard those whistles." said
Sanford, "I went up on the ramparts, as
I knew that there was something wrong.
I could not see anything, but I could hear
cries and voices out of the fog. 1 thought
they might come from fishermen. We
discussed the matter at 6 o'clock when the
men had breakfast."
Private Bridgens spoke for a group of
his comrades, who stood around him.
".Now that you ask us we will tell you,"
he saidt "but we did not want to be
drawn into the matter, and that is why
we have kept quiet. Why, dozens of
men were awakened by the terri
ble racket out there. Even the
men at the rapid-fire battery, down on
Bakers Beach, have told us the sam<*
thing. We all heard a, long whistle just
before things quieted down." That long
whistle was sounded for almost a min
ute. Some of us thought, it was ,the
transport Indiana coming in. - W T e.*are
not sailors and do not know the meaning
of Â¦ sea signals." â¢ .'..':
Private Ott spoke for a number of. his
comrades and, told) how all of them were
awakened from slumber by the' sound of
the RIo's whistle, which ended one
long, wailing scream.
Captain Hodgson of the Fort Point life
paving station was also seen yesterday
afternoon, and he seemed to feel acutely
the comment which has been -raised by
the failure of the life-boat's crew 8 to
know of the disaster to the Rio until
hours after the occurence.
Captain Hodgson's Statement.
"I have told my men many times," said
Captain Hodgson, "that they did not
earn a- cent down here in the station
house. -Up at the lookout was the place
where they earned their salary and where
their honor was a,t stake. Ellingson' has
been in the service., for six years., and I
have always found him reliable. His
watch clock shows he stamped it by the
key every half hour c he was on duty.
We were all in. bed down here.: and if: we
had received an alarm we could have
been at the wreck in 'about: ten minutes.
We could have saved perhaps sixty or
seventy lives. We have no patrol on
Bakers Beach, but the Golden Gate sta
tion maintains a patrol of two men on
the ocean front. I don't think that the
Golden Gate station could have heard the
whistles of the Rio after she passed
Point- Lobos. We did. not â¢ hear any
whistles down here. I wish we'had."
When Captain Hodgson -was : told yes
terday Â¦ that scores of soldiers at Fort
Point barracks had testified that they
were awakened by the Rio's whistles he
exclaimed: "Good God! Is that so?" *
When asked if he thought that Look
out Ellingson had heard the whistles the
captain said : "From what he â¢ tells \ me
he- heard some whistles, as there were
many ships at anchor outside. I must
confess that after what the soldiers have
stated Ellingson did not use proper Judg
ment." rj . - -. '
Elllngson could not be seen yesterday, as
he was absent from the station on leave.
Marking: the Wreck..
The wreck of the Rio"de Janeiro was
definitely located yesterday morning by
a party of Pacific Mail officials and div
ers on the tug Millen Griffith; Pilot Jor
dan ; accompanied "the searching^ party,
and, after the tug had cruised up and
down off Fort Point,, the wreck .was posi
tively placed. .The vessel lies withing 200
yardsiof the red buoy off Fort Point. The
depth of water over the rock Is eighteen
fathoms. The Pacific Mail Company, an
nounced .yesterday that no efforts will be
spared to search the wreck and recover
any bodies within 5 it., â¢ Divers will make
an attempt to-day to- reach the Vessel."
â¢ s Charles E. ' Wardi brother of â Captain
Ward of the Rio'de .Janeiro, arrived In
this" city yesterday from Denver, 1 Colo.

neiro met destruction and many lives went
out the value of the Lfe-saving department
was rendered useless by the error of judg
ment of Lookout -Mark ,. Elllngs.on. who
was on duty at the^ Fort Point station.
The story published in The Call yester
day that the life-saving crews should have
heard the distress whistles of the Rio de
Janeiro caused/ considerable comment in
the city in all circles. !," f .- .
Major Blakeiyey, superintendent of the
Life-saving District â of the. v Pacific
Cflait; . claims that not a : 'particle
of "b-lame could be attached to a single
man of the life-saving department and
that there is not an i;ta of evidence to
show that the Rio de Janeiro gave any
signals which might have led the lift
savers to think that there was a tragedy
in the deep being acted behind the dense
fog .of last Friday morning.
. < The dials; of the "watchman's tim<j
clocks" were produced by Major Blakeney
as evidence' tnat the lookouts at Fort
Point Â¦ and Golden Oate stations were
awake at the time of the disaster:
Â¦;.... ' Lookout's Grievous Error.
,The very â¢ evidence produced by Mr.
Blakeney in defense of the lookouts helps
to. prove that the lookout at Fort Point
was guilty ot" gross error and careless in
his duties.
The superintendent refused to accep*.
any testimony presented to him that tlu
Rio-de Janeiro sounded whistles of dis
tress which should have caused the look
ottt"to give an alarm and call out the life
boats. Â»Â¦ 'Â¦ '..
' He stated that he would not believe tne
surviving officers of the wrecked ship even'
Â¦if. -they . testified to this fact before the
official- Investigators. ,, â¢
â¢/'The Rio never. sounded any distress
whistles;" said Mr. Blakeney, "and there
Â¦Is "nbt a particle of responsible evidence to
Bhdw that i-he gave any whistles outside
of ; the ordinary fog signals. If I want to
i set" any evidence aÂ£ to whether the Rio
gave any distress whistles I would go out
.to 'the Presidio- and hear what the sol
diers .have to" say. I -refuse to be inter
"viewed on this matter. The Government
will hold an investigation to see if any of
the men of the life-saving department an?
to be blamed. I don't know who will con
duct : the investigation. I don't think I
will' do so, for I have not acted in thi
capacity of investigator , for Â£ome time on
account of my age. Some one will be de
taiLed by the authorities at Washington
to' make an inquiry."
Soldiers^ Testify.
The suggestion made. by Mr. Blakeney
that the soldiers at the Presidio should
be seen as to whether they heard distress
whistles from the Rio de Janeiro was
acted upon, with the astounding result
that scores of men in Fort Winfleld Scott
barracks at Fort Puint stated yesterday
that- the sound of the distress signals had
awakened them Friday morning.
A visit to the various rooms in the bar
racks disclosed the same information from
the soldiersâ that all had been awakened
by the noise of -the Rio de Janeiro's whis
tles.
- Yet Mark Elllngson, the lookout of. tha
Fort Point Life-saving Station, who -was
on duty on the bluff above the barracks,
claims that he heard nothing out of the
ordinary that fatal morning and did not
know of the disaster lor hours afterward,
when a boatload of survivors came ashore
and then the lookout gave the warning
for the launching of the lifeboats.
; To the .'testimony of the soldiers .who
were roused from their slumbers by the
Rio de Janeiro's distress signals must be
added the positive evidence of Private
Taylor of the coast artillery, who was on
sentry "duty on the bluffs above the look
out station at the time the .Rio de Ja
neiro struck the rocks. The sentry stated
that after a long, strange whistle from the
.Rjq deÂ°'Janeiro. .which ended in a gurgle.
he shcutferi twice toward the lookout- sta-~
tionf. "What is the, trouble Â«ut there?"
and his cries were

For the third ; time within as many
years t the large hay barn owned by
Charles S. Healy and situated directly
opposite St. Luke's Hospital, on Valencia
street, was burned last night. The barn Is
situated dangerously near the hospital,
and for a time great fear was entertained
that the conflagration would spread to
that .institution.- â¢;
The fire department responded quickly,
however, and, as there was no wind to
carry- the blaze across the street, the
hospital escaped with a scorching.- When
a barn on the same premises was con
sumed a year ago. the heatc from the
blaze cracked windows In the hospital,
and. the patients' in some of the wards
had to be removed. . ~ ' - .
The destroyed barn was a large wooden
structure completely filled with hay. Its
value, which Is placed at $2500. is covered
by insurance. Frank Johnson of Truck

DENVER. Feb. 26.â Mrs. Walter R. Din
more wasborn Miss Morgan in Independ
ence, iMo. Her family was well-to-do!
About fifteen years ago she married Nat
Vincent, clerk of the Criminal Court of
Jackson County, Mo. A few years later
Vincent secured a divorce. N. H. Cone,
manager of the mining Interests of D. H.
MoffRt and Eben Smith In Cripple Creek,
met her in Independence and married her.
The Cones had a residence in Denver at
1138 Downing avenue, although Mr. Cone's
business kept him from home much of the
time. A year and a half ago. Mr. Cone
died of pneumonia, leaving his widow- a
fortune of about $200,000.
Dinmore Is pretty badly "cut up" over
the sad experience of his honeymoon. He
lays? the. blame of the estrangement to
certain letters and telegrams his wife re
ceived during their stay at the ranch, and
declares that Jule Gamage, the brother
in-law of his former marriage, has influ
enced his new wife against him.
"Mclvor was my best man," said Din
more, "and he introduced Van Praag to
me. I presented them both to Mrs. Din
more, and we dined and lunched together.
On the- morning of the wedding, when I
went to Mrs. Cone's rooms to shov her
the published announcement of oui ap
proaching wedding I found both Mclvor
and Van Praag calling upon her. Van
Praag paid the lady marked attention at
the wedding breakfast and also during
our honeymoon. Although I -have been
unable to see Mrs. Dinmore at the hos
pital I know that both Van Praag and
Mclvor have been admitted."
A peculiar feature of the honeymoon,
according to Dinmore, is the fact that
Mclvor and Van Praag accompanied him
self and wife on their trip. They
remained on the ranch over-night, break
fasted with the bridal pair the next
morning and left-, in the afternoon to re
turn to this city. On the following Sun
day they went down again to see Dinmore
and his bride.
"We went d9w.11 to Linda Â«Vlsta. Mr. McÂ»
Ivor's ranch, ." to spend the honeymoon.
Immediately upon our arrival Mrs. Din
more's attitude toward me changed.' She
was distant and formal. We remained at
Linda- Vista for one week. On the last
Sunday of our stay- there Mclvor and
Van Praag were there. "We were all out
riding. Mrs. Dinmore was on horseback.
Her horpe took fright upon the approach
of a train and ran away.- Mrs. Dinmore
was thrown, and the result was a nervous
shock and a Â¦wrenched back. "We returned
to town on Monday. A doctor was called
in to. attend to Mrs. Dinmore, and on
Wednesday, acting upon his advice, she
went to the McNutt Hospital." *
0 "I can't explain it," he said last evenfng.
"Previous to our marriage I told Mrs.
Dinmore that I was a divorced man and
also explained, to her my stand-,
ing. Â° 1 made no^attempt to hide anything
from her and she declared she was per*
fectly contented with me, my pastJlfe and
my financial position. On the morning, of
our wading one of the newspapers pub
lished an announcement, of our_ c approach
ig 5 marriage) and .went into the details of
my past life. tO Â°I O showed the article to
the lady who was about to become my
wife and;told her.Lf she regretted dhe step
she was about 1 to take It was stlll^ time o to
drawÂ° 0 'back. Â° i But no; she said she was
perfectly contented and 4 happy and we
were "married. -Â° O ,.Â°. Â° = =Â¦ Â¦ Â° Â°
Dinmore was married to the lady who
now bears his name on February 12 in the
Palace Hotel. His bride was a widow, Mrs.
N. H, Cone. relict , of , a. Denver
mining man. Dinmore himself had had a
previous matrimonial experience that had
been rounded out In the divorce court
some years previous.
The wedding was celebrated at noon. .A
bridal breakfast followed and then f he
newly wedded couple left: for the Linda
Vista ranch, Mission San Jose. C. C. Mc
lvor was best man at the wedding and
Joseph Van Praag, a friend, of Mclvor's.
accompanied the bridal pair. On Monday,
last Mr. and Mrs. Dinmore returned to
town^and'took up their residence at the
Palace Hotel. S On Wednesday^ Mrs. Dln
more !decided that absolute rest and Quiet
were for the -shattered Â° condi
tion of her t nerves and thereupon took a
room at the McNutt Hospital, where she
still remains. .â â 5 ' " " ,
'fcSince Mrs. Dinmore has been an- inmate
of the hospital; her husband has sought,

Mrs. Walter Dinmore, a bride of two
