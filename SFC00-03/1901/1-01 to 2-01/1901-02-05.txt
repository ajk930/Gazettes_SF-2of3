After several speeches for and against
the Government the Chamber adjourned
until to-morrow.
This- Is the situation with which the
Chamber was confronted to-day, and It Is
disgruntled with both the Government
and the committee. The closing of the
Chamber of- Commerce at Of ao?.,.- which
led to the recent troublesome strike, fur
nishes a peg on which the Government
was attacked in an interpellation brought
forward to-day. There was a large gath
ering of Deputies' and spectators, as the
fall of the Ministry was anticipated.

While she was praying a drunken man
was brought !n by an officer. Mrs. Nation
immediately went to him acd Informed
him that she was his friend at all times,
even though the policemen were not. Sha
then delivered an address to the members
of the police force present, which was full
of the most scathing abuse that she was
capable of giving. She said that they
would permit the Joints to run In open
violation of law all the while, and would
then arrest the men who were made drunk
by all the liquor sold there. Mrs. Nation
taunted the police, calling 1 them, cowards
afraid to arrest anybody but women and
drunken men. They angrily flushed under
her accusations.
On leaving the police station, Mrs. Na
tion encountered George Klour, one of tha
most notorious jolntists of the city. She
asked him if he was a jointist. lie replied
that ho was not.
"Well, then, you ought to be helping
us close the Joints," said Mrs. Nation.
"Oh. I. am going to leave town to-night."
said Klour, and the crowd shouted with
delight. Many of them were not sympa
thizers with Mrs. Nation, but they enjoyed
the famous jolntlst's confusion.
Followed by the crowd, Mrs. Nation
then -went to the Federal building, whejra
she Inquired for her mall. She then
mounted the steps of the building: and
made an address to the crowd. She said
she would smash all the Joints of the city,
and she would stay here long enough to
accomplish this purpose if It took months.
She vaa not afrah). she said, as she bad
no reason In the world to be. There were
many women In the city who would help
her. she said, and they would do so at tha
proper time. Mrs. Nation did not Intend
to begin the Joint raids until to-morrow.
While she and the other women were In
a store buying the hatchets which wera
to be used In the raid there came In a
woman who said her son had spent all hl.i
money In Murphy's place the night before.
"Well, let's go and smash it tight now."
said Mrs. Nation, and the other women
agreed.

Some Interesting developments are>
looked for to-morrew. Mra. Nation de
clares she. will enter tbe joints and smash
them, Â¦white the jolntists are equally cer
tain she will not. The Jointists have ne
groes hired to watch their places of busi
ness, and they have orders to shoot down
any person, man or woman, who attempts
to enter the Joint bent on mischief.
The better element, of the people of the
city am much worried at the turn affairs
have taken. They think that now Is the
time, if ever, that "Topeka's Joints" will
be closed, but they, stand aghast at the
Addressed the Police.
TOPEKA. Feb. 4.â Mrs. Xatlca gather* X
a half dozen of her helpers late this aftet -
noon and attempted to enter the Cllppi"
restaurant joint on East Sixth strcf'.
awned by F. W. Murphy, for the purpo: 1Â»
of wrecking It. Mrs. Xatlon has been hoi '+
so long that she has become familiar* ' 'Â»
the watchers at the joints, and she d' i
not succeed In getting near the Joint |i
question before she was recognized, ai^
Immediately a dozen strong men were it
the door of the Joint to prevent h' P
entrance.
Tho little band of women strugglfi
valiantly against the superior strength of
the ruffians who were trying to keep
them out of the saloon- In the melee two
of the women were thrown down and
their hatchets taken from, them. Sirs.
Nation's face was slightly cut by her
hatchet. By this time the police managed
to arrive and took the women In charge.
As the women were being taken to> the
police station they were followed by a.
thousand or more jeering, hooting men.
most of whom were tnÂ© negro watchers
employed to keep the women out of the
joints and to do them violence If they
persisted in entering.
There were a number of Mrs. Nation's
sympathizers in the crowd and they rave
her the protection that the police seemed
unable to give. One joint man, who was
a little over-zealous, insisted that Mrs.
Nation be killed and punctuated his re
marks with a great deal of picturesque
language. Mrs. "Nation, turned to rebuke
him, when he tried to hit her. A man
near by gave the would-be assaulter a
blow In the face. He Immediately turned
again to the attack and then the fljcht be
Â¦ caxne rather general. Several of the fist
fights were in progress all the way to tha
station and it seemed; as though some
body would be seriously hurt before ths
game proceeded much farther.
At the police station Mrs. Nation was
formally charged with disturbing ths
peace, and her name was entered on tho
docket. The Police Judge was at the sta
tion and Mrs. Nation refused to go to his
room to see him regarding her offense, but
insisted that he come to her, which ho
did. Mrs. Nation was Informed that she
would report for trial at the Police Court
to-morrow morning and was then released
on her own recognizance. She said she.
would be glad to do so and then proceeded
to hold an Impromptu prayer meeting In
the police station. She prayed that ths
work that she had begun in Topeka might
be abundantly prosperous.

W.. WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.â It developed
to-day that by the treaty recently ratified
by the Senate the United States, in
addition to perfecting its claims to the
islands of Xagayan and â¢. SIbutu, has
definitely established its right to sover
eignty over tbe Bachl or Bashee and other
islands to the north , of the â¢ Philippine
archipelago proper. . . :
A report is current to-day that the steps
taken by this' Government to complete
its title to Bashee and other' Islands to
the north of Luzon were due to.represen
tations made' by Japan. After the acqui
sition of Formosa from . China, . Japan
found . the % question 'of Jurisdiction Â¦ a
troublesome one because, of -the Spanish
claim to islands near Formosa, and after
negotiation/ the boundary- line between
the Japanese and. Spanish possessions was
fixed at 21 degrees 30'mlnutes, Just south
of the island. of Formosa and # to the north
of Bashee : Island. The treaty of ! Paris

the naval attache. of the Peace Commls
'sion, upon examination of more detailed
charts of the Philippines, discovered that
Bachl and several other islands lay out
side of the northern boundary, and It is
apparent that Japan made the same dis
covery.
To correct this error. Secretary Hay In
the treaty for the purchase of tho islands
of Cagayari and SIbutu for $100,000 Induced
the Spanish' Government to agree to thla
as a text of the> article: "Spain relin
quishes to the United States all claim and
title which .she- may have had at the
conclusion of the treaty of peace of Paris
to. any and all Islands belonging to the
Philippine archipelago lying outside the
lines described in Article III of that
treaty," and particularly to the islands of
Cagayan. Sulu and SIbutu and their de
pendencies, and agrees that such Islands
shall be comprehended in the cession of
the archipelago as fully, as If they had
been expressly Included .within these
lines." â¢ ...*'. ?Â¦
The belief prevails; netÂ© that Japan de
sired the United Stated jto acquire defini
tive title to the islands north of the twen
tieth degree of latitude, rather than per
mit Spain ;to claim them for the purpose
of selling them to Germany or some other

The route of the last funeral procession
was through the Norman gateway, across
the quadrangle, through the George IV
archway, down Long Walk, through the
lodge gates and then from Long Walk to
the mausoleum.
The route from the George IV archway
to the gates of the mausoleum was lined
with troops under the command of Col
onel Miles of the First Life Guards.
There, between the broad avenue Â¦ of
stately trees, the crowds were the thick
est, forming dense black banks.
At the lodgre gates the strain of tho
band died away and the pipere commenced
their lament.
The rear of the procession was brought
up by the suites of the Kings and Princes,
their varicolored overcoats forming a
striking patch of color. Down the long

dirge, this quiet throng slowly made its

Syndicate Knows His Ability and He
Is to Have Full
Scope.
Charles M. Hays will continue as pres
ident of the Southern Pacific Railroad,
and it Is definitely stated that the Vander
bilt syndicate will 'make no changes in
the personnel cf the road. The new own
ers of the Southern Pacific are conserva
tive financiers to the core and President
Hays Is looked upon as a man of sterling i
worth. His rrputaUor. is world-wide in I
tranFcr-ntinentaJ transportation circles. ]
When he took the helm of the Grand '
Trunk the road was looked upon as a t
derelict, yet with great executive ability !
he not only put the road on a paying \
basis, but to-day it is looked upon as one
of the be=t railroad investments In the
country. The Vanderbilt syndicate is cog
r.izar.t of President Hays* splendid ability
and he will be given full authority to act
in any way he may think fit for the bene-
Xit of the roarl.
Reports were circulated that President
Hays was on his way East to consult
with the syndicate and receive instruc
tion?. bt:t these rumors have proved erro
neous. President Hays, accompanied by
General Manager Kruttschr.iit and other
members of the executive staff of the
Southern Pacific, arc- en a tour of inspec
tion over the Western division. The party
reached Ogden at noon yesterday and will
today go on to Salt Lake City. It is ex
pected that Hays vull go to New York in
the n"ar future, but he will not po until
tie has made a thorough Inspection of the
whole Southern Pacific svstoin and can
give a good report of the condition of the
road .ind its various connections

Faciue board of directors, who resides In
New York. It is said will also retain his
position. It is claimed he has a marvel

The report th2t Horace G. Burt presi
dent of the T'r.ion Pacific, would take
complete control of both rands as chief
executive off.cer of ihe syndicate is not

NewTork financiers indorse the remarks
of Russell Saeo. -nrho sal<i "it would be
bad policy to consolidate the two roads "
PBESIDZN7 HAYS "WILL
RETAIN SIS PLACE
It was stated to-day that this matter
find not yet been determined and that in
fact the future plan for the financing or
handling of the Southern Pacific system
had not been considered by the syndicate.
Tl.(- latter, however, have stated that the
{>!an involved not the formation of a col
ateral trust or Imposing any other burden
upon the Union Pacific. In consequence
the announcement of the plan is awaited
â¢with much interest.
Trading in Atchison was on an encr
rr.ouÂ« scale. I'nion Pacific and Southern
Pacific were also both very ax-live. Sug
gestion was made in Wall Ftreet to-day
thiit further study of the Southern PaciJlc
situation might develop a pian whereby
the I'nion Pacific would be able to assume
absolute and permanent control of the
<;entral Pacific without assuming the bur
dÂ«.n of the entire Southern Pacific sys
tem. As has already been stated in The
Call, upon the authority of men Interested
in the transaction, the chief aim of the
alarrimaji syndicate was to obtain control
of the Central Pacific and assure the per
manency of the rmtura.1 connection of the
Union Pacific. To obtain this they had.
however, to purchase the control of the
entire system.

The Rev. Father Thomas P. McLough
lln of New York City lectured last night
before a large audience in Metropolitan
Hall on the subject, "The Songs of the
Sunny South." It was what might be
termed a "musical lecture" and those
who braved the rainstorm to hear the
popular speaker were rewarded by a most
entertaining address. William Craig
acted as chairman and announced that
Father McLoughlln would sing by special
request "The Palms" before commencing
the lecture. After the rendition of the
solo. Father McLouKhlin said that he did
not intend giving what might be Called a
lecture. ' - -'.\
"It will be a simple talk," said he. "on
the power of music. There is no power in
the world that has greater influence over
the hearts and minds of men thanlnuslc.
All men are moved by It; some In the
heart, some in the intellect and some in
the feet. It doesn't matter what words
are attached to a song. It Is the air that
makes the impression on people."
After reading from a number of songs
that are inspiring. Father McLoughlin
continued: "When you go home to-nipht
think over these sonps and I am sure that
you will find that It is not the words but
the music that has made them dear to
you. Music is the most wonderful factor
In the formation of character In a child.
Train a child to love pood music and you
train It to good morals. An air. a song,
that becomes dear to us In childhood is
never forgotten. It may be fifty or it
may be sixty years afterward when we
hear the old refrain, the old song we loved
as children. It at once brings us hack to
our childhood and will have more influ
ence over us than all the sermons ever
preached. The recollections brought back
to us by an old melody o'ftentimes brings
more contrition to our hearts than the
most powerful "sermon. The most of us
do not understand Verdi or Wapner. but
we understand and love the old folk son^s
that we listened to at mother's knee and
they are ever dear to our hearts."

the piet to-day the discussion of the
canal bill was opened. The Minister of
Public "Works, Herr Thlelen. while Intro
ducing the measure, said the object was
to bring about a rapprochement between
the east and the west; promote the sale
of 'their products, both at home and
abroad, and then Increase thÂ© defensive
power of the country.
"If tho canal Is built," said the Minis
ter, "the country will enjoy both land ana
water communications such as no other
state around us possesses." .
During the first reading of the bill it
was interesting to note that in spite of the
strong speeches favoring the canal, deliv
ered by Dr. Mlquel. the Minister of
Finance, and Herr Thiolen, who showed
the unreasonableness of the counter argu
ments, speakers representing the major
ity parties (namely both of the Conserva
tive groups, the Center and thÂ© Mational-
Liberals) pronounced themselves strongly
against the canal in the present shape of
the bill, even after Dr. Miquel had plainly
hinted that In case of another rejection
of the measure thÂ© Diet would bÂ© dis
solved.
Count von Llmbursr-Stirum, the Con
servative leader. Ironically said that If It
were true that the projected Midland ca
nal would greatly facilitate thÂ© transpor
tation of troops, provisions, etc.. In case
of war. then the empire ought to largely
contribute toward Its construction. In h!*
opinion. Count von LJmburg-Stlru.ni said,
the bill should be opposed, as a large ma
jority of the population of the monarchy
would bÂ« severely Injured by the proposed
Bhlne-Elbe canal. Moreover, hÂ© declared
that he could see serious economic objec
tions to the canal scheme. Inasmuch as
undue preference would be given by it
to Rotterdam. The military advantages
of the Rhine-Elbe canal would not be suf
ficient, he continued, to Justify its con
struction. â¢
Herr von Eynern asserted that the very
existence of industry depended upon the
construction of the canals. Speaking for
the National-Liberals, he declared that
his political friends would support tha
proposed agricultural bills and he said he
hoped that after an increase in the duties
had been granted the agriculturists would
be in a position to supply the Increasing
German demands for food.

resolution, offered by Senator Lardner,
wasadopted in the Senate to-day: . .
â¢In these days when-.th*; press can by daily
abuse, and crimination prevent the re-election
of Judges whose decisions .have been honestly
rendered, when . aggregated capital or aggre
gated labor (an secure tie defeat of a Judge
who has neither. usurped nor shrunk from his
duty, but has simply taken the course marked
out by law. it is small wonder that an elected'
Judiciary is not always independent, without
fear and without reproach. To our endless glory
and good fortune Marshall was independent of
official favor or popular prejudice or Jour
nalistic lampooning. We believe, however,
that none of these would have -affected his de
cisions even had . Jefferson had' the. power, of
removing him or had the voters had the op
portunity of defeating him at the polls.
We believe that during the century Just open
ing, with the fever of concentration burning
in the veins . of both capital and labor, ' the
former desiring to accumulate dollars and the
latter desiring, to ".share them, with the labor
trust controlling the votes and the industrial
trusts controlling the dollars, the-. need -of an
Independent Judiciary will become more and
more a prersing necessity. On both sides there
is rlzht. On each side there is often wrong.
Each i should have ' equal Justice. But this
even-handed Justice must come from anr inde
pendent Judiciary, and .this independence- can
be secured only by life: or a long tenure of
office and by ample compensation..
It has been said by an orator in. speaking of
Marshall that, the test . of. greatness is grear
ability coupled with great opportunity greatly
employed. This country* will always produce
men of great ability and it will always furnish,
great opportunities. These to be greatly em
ployed Upon the bench muse be coupled .with
treat independence. . â¢ Â¦ .

a mass-meeting was held at Cordray's
Theater. Judge C B. Bellinger of the
United States Court presiding. Hon. Hor
ace G. Platt of Ban Francisco was the
orator of the occasion. In'the course of
his oration he said: . \ ., \ % -
The esoecial characteristic of Marshall to
â¢which I desire to call attention, apart from
.his great wisdom, was his great courage.
Many Judges are .learned and able. Most
Judges are honest. Not s6 many have the
courage of their convictions. Many are in
timidated by the necessity of ' courting popu
lar frfvor when â¢ they Beek re-election. Some
seek popular approval and mistake the repu

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â Blinded and suf
fering mental torture even more severe
than his physical agony. Rev. John A.
Keller of Holy Trinity Mission in Arling
ton, N. J., protests his Innocence of the
crime charged against Tiim by the man
who attempted his life.
Cool and collected, showing no trace
of the frenzy under which he labored
Sunday morning, Thomas G. Barker re
fused to see one of his friends who called
at the Arlington Jail to see him to-day.
He expressed sorrow only because he had
faik-d in his effort to take the life of
Mr. Keller, once his intimate friend, the
man whom he believes violated his home
by means of brutal force.
Mrs. Barker bears up well tinder the
weight of anxiety that oppresses her.
Only once did she give way to hysteria,
that occasion being when she parted with
her husband, whom she had visited in his
cell. At her home she -was visited by few,
the women of Arlington not having de
termined where their sympathy should be
bestowed.
Rev. Keller's injuries, though of a seri
ous nature, are not necessarily fatal.
Friends of Mr. Barkerâ and he has many
âcontinue to believe him in the right.
Members of his church and his personal
friends outside refuee to believe aught
acainst Rev. Mr. Keller. Friends of the
latter assert that the Grand Jury will be
asked to indict Barker. .
Three stories are told, all of which have
a bearing upon this remarkable case. One
is that which is Riven to his friends by
Mr. Barker. It is a repetition of a con
fession which his wife Is said to have
made to him last Saturday night, which
drove him into the frenzy that resulted in
his attempt upori the life of Rev. Keller.
That he believes this story to be true in
every essential no one who knows Mr.
Barker will doubt. When he took the law
into his own hands, undoubtedly he be
lieved that he was performing a duty
which he owed to society. Now that the
frenzy has loft him he Is still confident
that he has done nothing more than was
rfpht.
Another story, told by members of Trin
ity Mission, which accounts for the man
ner in which. Mr. and Mrs. Barker with
drew from the church organization, re
lates to a hysterical woman subject to
fits of great mental excitement, during
which she is not to be held accountable
for her action?. Keller waived examin
ation before a magistrate to-day.

monies In the hall of the House of Rep
resentatives at- the Capitol. â¢ Â¦
The programme arranged by the Joint
committee of Congress and "William Wirt
Howe of New Orleans, president of the_

and dignified, as became the life of the
great jurist. The President and his Cabi
net, the members of fhe Supreme Court,
the members of the Senate and House,
the diplomatic corps and mbmbers of the
District Bar Association attended as !n
vited . guests. Many other distinguished
persons were in the galleries, which were
reserved for those holding cards of ad
mission. Although the " various official
bodk-s entered the hall together, they
were not announced as on a formal occa
sion. President McKinley and the mem
bers of the Cabinet were the last to ar-'
rive. The entire assemblage arose and
remained standing until they had saated
themselves.
Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania
called the assemblage to order. He stated
briefly the action of Congress in providing
for the ceremonies and the selection of
Chief Justice Fuller as presiding officer.

was escorted to the chair by Representa
tives Grosvr nor of Ohio and Richardson of
Tennessee. The Rev. Dr. William Streeth
f-r Jones of Trenton. N. J.. a prcatÂ»grand

blessing.
The Chief Justice, in introducing Hon.
Wayn<Â» MacVeagh, who was to deliver the
oration, paid an eloquent tribute to the
preat work of Marshall, v.-hirh evoked
hearty applause from the assemblage. His
address was devoted almost entirely to the
consideration of his predecessor's career
as an expounder of the Federal constitu
tion, v â¢- y
At the conclusion of Chief Justice. Ful
ler's remarks Mr. MacVeagh delivered his
oration. It was a thoughtful, scholarly
production and .was several tirres Inter
rupted by applause.

the Idea of celebrating the assumption of

chinery was silent to-day, "while bench

of the laity paid homage to the memory
of John Marshall. The chief interest of
the celebration here was in the oration of
the day, by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge
of Massachusetts, at the' Auditorjum.

The Board of Health has ; received a
plaintive kick from the leper settlement
at Molokai. A number of the lepers ap
pointed a committee to address the board

the board on the subject. The letter says
that many of the lepers have become
weak on account of tho lack of pol, and
that many will soon be laid In their graves
if the want is not supplied. The native
Hawaiian needs poi for food. "Jiice,
bread and crackers are all very well lri
their way." says the letter from the lep
ers, "but we cannot llvo without poi." If
the board cannot feed them with poi, the
lepers ask to be released from their land
of pain and sorrow, in order that they
may return to their families and be looked
after.

to despair. Winds changed and the ves

near shore nor attract attention by sig

end of that time she went ashore on the
reef at Waianae. Captain. Green and the
crow got ashore and were assisted by the
plantation at Waianae. Later they were
brought to Honolulu by the Oahu Rail

may be saved, as the beach is sandy

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 4.â The "members' lobby" Is
now a feature of the Assembly Chamber:
but the iron railing between It and the
seats of the members has proved ade
quate as a barrier to keep out the wives
of Assemblymen.
The issue was Joined this morning, when
several Assemblymen were tapped on the
shoulder by the sergeant at arms and in
formed that the new rule was l'n force and
that no. persons, not even their brides,
were to be allowed Inside the new railing.
Knight of San Francisco promptly intro
duced a resolution that the new rule be
not construed to prevent the presence in
side the railing of the wives of members.
The resolution aid not meet unanimous
approval. Ralston said the Â«rule was
adopted with a. purpose and if the As
sembly began by making exceptions the
barrier would soon be broken down en
tirely. Melick illustrated his objection in
a manner that "brought down" the house.
He said:
"How are you going to regulate 6uch
an exception as this? My wife is not here.
Suppose I brins a woman into the As
sembly Chamber with me â how are you
going to know whether it. is my wife or
some other man's wife?"
Carter inquired whether it would be In
good taste for bachelors to vote on the
resolution.
Judge I-alrd came to the defense of the
women with true Southern chivalry.
"The women who come to the Assem

said, "make much Ipss noise than the men.
They create no confusion, and if they are
not tiresome to their husbands the rest of
us ought not to object. 1 '
The resolution was adopted. Knight
grew bolder and offered a resolution ad

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 4.â Represented by
Senator Devlin. Sacramento mada
a desperate fight to retain her
third Assemblyman thia after
noon. Devlin appeared beforÂ© tha
Senate Committee on Apportionment,
which proposes to take from Sacramento
one of her three Assemblymen and turn
the coveted legislator over to Mono. Al
pine and Inyo counties. Though small in
population, It was shown that these three
counties are very much of a world by
themselves, and by the physical charac
teristics of the State they are cut off
from the other counties to which they are
joined for the purposes of forming dis
tricts, both Senatorial and Assembly.
Devlin argued that If Sacramento, with
a population of 45/00, had but two As
semblymen, each would represent 22,500
persons, or far above the allotment for
Assembly districts. Thia was answered
by the comment that should three be al
lowed each would represent 15,000, or much
below the allotment. Devlin then called
attention to the fact that, even were this
bo, the commitee was attempting to allow
a separate Assemblyman to three coun
ties the aggregate population of which
was no more than 10.000. This was met
with the argument that the Injunction ot
the constitution was that the State should
be apportioned in the manner that woulcV
best represent all the people, and that the
plan of theycommittee, which was the one
which cut Sacramento's representation by
one-third, had been submitted only after a
careful consideration of the needs of thÂ«
whole State.
In vain Devlin argued that Sacramento
was entitled to the extra Assemblyman
by the terms of the constitution, which,
says the people of a county shall be rep
resented equally, for ho was met with an
other and broader provision, which re
quires that the people of thÂ« State shall
be equally represented. It was shown that
because of their small population Inyo,
Mono and Alpine could never obtain recog
nition In conventions, and as they all have
an Identity of interest It was decided to
give them one Assemblyman to them
selves.
The committee finally stopped Devlin's
argument with the proposition that in
stead of tearing to pieces the plan which
the committee had drawn he should sub
mit a better one, with Sacramento holding
on to her three Assemblymen. This Dev
lin said he would try to do so. and so he
was Riven until next "Wednesday to work
out the salvation of his county.
Lardner was to the front with a claim
to have Placer recopr.Ized as a complete
Assembly district, joining El Dorado with
Amador to form another, but no action
was taken upon it. Should this be done
Davis' voice will be raised In protest, for
he wants none of El Dorado In his Sen
atorial district, and the coupling of El
Dorado with Amador would compel him
to take it.

two years ago, when the county was re

whiled away an hour or so discussing the
formation of a textbook commission.
President Wheeler was opposM to the
idea, for he said the State Board should
not allow a matter so Important as the
selection and compilation of textbooks to
leave its own hands. The measure sus
gested by the subcommittee which met
yesterday, providing one Commissioner to

direction of the board, was discussed, but
the board was unwilling to go even that
far into the realm of legislation, prefer
ring to content itself with suggesting to
both houses what legislation It deems
needful and then leaving the matter in the
hands of the two committees on educa

Mrs. Nation later entered the drugstore

members of tho Legislature came in she
conducted them behind the counter and
asked them to drink. They refused in
each case, however, not because they did
not want the liquor, as they had gone
to the 'store to get some, but for reasons
best known to .themselves they preferred
not to net it from Mrs. Nation. Mrs. Na

knew all the different kinds of liquor as

liquors in the drugstore and pronounced
many of them excellent. Before leaving
however, she earned the druggist to dis

Curtin's idea is to provide an Inspector
of mines,, whose duty.it shall be to look
up complaints regarding the safety of any
mine, and to suggest changes, and,addi
tions to the safety devices and appliances.
There is no penalty attached to a disre
gard of the inspector's suggestions, but
in caso of an accident where": he has
warned the company, his evidence would
augment the â¢ damages recovered,, and
where an -accident occurred when he had
passed a mine as being safe, his evidence
would bear out the mine-owner in his
claim that the accident was unavoidable.
Futile Argument in Its
" '.'v ' Support.
Senator Curtin. Delivers an Able but
antlne measures, which ' tho
friends of the Chief Executive have bee a
trying to get through the Assembly <m
rush orders â Is now very much In doubt.
Tho bills originally received the support
of many country members on the supposi
tion that they were framed to protect
California's commercial interests^and the
resolutions adopted by the various com
mercial bodies of San Francisco, protest
ing against the passage of the bills, have
already changed the attitude of a num
ber of Assemblymen and Insured tlie
strenuous opposition of many Senators. .
Tho subject came up in the Assembly
this morning on a motion by Feliz to re
consider the motion by which was passed
Assembly bill No. 600, tho one placing an
appropriation of $100,000 at tha disposal ot
the State Board of Health, to be expend
ed under the direction of the Governor.
â . bare quorum was present, and after a
lon^ contest In parliamentary tactics, in
which roll calls, calls of the absentees,
calls of the house and points of order of
no quorum, played prominent parts, the
motion to reconsider was laid on the tab'e
on motion of Johnson. The vote stood,
Ayes 24, noes 13. Knight explained his
vote against tho motion to lay on the
table by calling attention to the resolu
tions adopted in San Francisco. His po
sition was that In view of such action the
passage of the bill should be reconsidered.
Mellck explained his vote against the
motion to lay on the table on the same
ground that Knieht gave.
The other bills, Nos. B58 and 559, are a
special order for to-morrow morning im
mediately after the reading of the Jour
nal, and at that time the contest will be
fought out, so far as the Assembly is con
cerned.
George E. Plummer, representing the
Shipowners' Association of the Pacific
Coast, was tho first of the representatives
of tho commercial bodies of San Francisco
to arrlvoi to work against these measures.
He was busy this morning explaining to
Assemblymen the reasons for the opposi
tion of San Francisco business men. Ho
asked that delay be granted until other
representatives should be able to reach
Sacramento, and his efforts helped to pre
vent the Immediate defeat of Fellz's mo
tion to reconfeider the passage of Assem
blv bill No. 560.
The flght against Assembly bills 55S and
559 will bo bitter. Assemblymen who vot
ed for the appropriation bill on Saturday
and who had changed to the opposition
to-day as a. result of .the new Information
they had received, but were unable to ob
tain a reconsideration and were compelled
to see the bill pass out of the Assembly's
hands with their votes recorded Â«f or it, will
make every effort to-morrow to defeat its
companion measures.
The Health Committee of the Senate to
day took up the consideration of that por
tion of the Governor's biennial message
relating to the plague, which had been
referred to It, and decided to report it
back to the Senate without recommenda
tion. This was done on motion of Rowell,
who made the motion "in view of the fact
that the Federal and State quarantine
officials and the Federal and State offl
cials were working upon the problem
treated of in the measure."
Assembly bill 560, which carries the ap
propriation of $100,000 for the Governor to'
use in suppressing contagious diseases,
having passed the Assembly, came before
the committee, but it will not be consid
ered until to-morrow. Neither will the
other measures on the same subject in
troduced in the Senate by Cutter.

STANDS BY

The board of directors of the Merchants'
Association has published an official ap
peal to the members ot that organization
to stand by the municipal Civil service.
They state that It is the foundation of
good government, and that they have an
abiding faith in the service- and the Com
missioners. The appeal is as follows:
To the Members of the Merchants' Associa
tion and the Public: It is not stranse that
the introduction of civil service in place of
the spoils system should meet with opposition.
It will always bo opposed by those who want
positions and fall to obtain them and by the
natural opponents of the administration which
supports the system.
This association, seeking no office and hav
ing no enmity toward any administration.
must stand by the civil service principle and
by those who endeavor to carry It out. It
la the principle by which the merchant con
ducts, his business; the principle of common
cense; the principle of good government. With
out It. we cannot hope to make San Francisco
a credit or a satisfaction to her citizens. With
it, we may, in time, remove the greatest ob
stacle to her success. The directors of the
Merchants' Association have made it' the first
principle in their efforts to aid in municipal
affairs. To assist In its establishment > they
consented that our secretary should serve as
i.no of the commissioners. We know his -worth
and his absolute reliability. One of our di
icctcrs resigned to accept another appointment
on the Board of Civil Service Commissioners.
They must not now be doubted unless proof
can be given of their malfeasance.
Civil service has had a fight to sustain Itself
in national affairs, and wherever.- else at
tempted, and we must expect the same experi
ence-here. It has much- to: gain from experi
ence and much to learn from such errors as
must necessarily, occur. But good cltlsens
should not weaken In its support and the mem
bers of the Merchants'. Association must not
bo misled by unsupported newspaper attacks.
Our president and a committee of this board
have endeavored to ascertain If there Is any
Just ground for the various criticisms recently
made, and we are gratified 'to report that care
ful Inquiry has - developed no - proof - of the
slightest tendency toward unfairness . or of any
lack of absolute uprlRhtness and integrity on
the part of. the commission. % ,
Charges unsupported and unproven, â¢ from
Â¦whatever source, should obtain no hold in the
minds of our- gcod ' citizens.- Every political
and | unfair attempt to break down the system
should be stoutly resisted. We ask that a
reasonable charity be > granted for such slight
errors as may occur, that I the integrity : of the
commission Â¦ be recognized and supported ' and
that this foundation principle . of good gov
ernment bo; permitted a firm* establishment
In' all our municipal affairs. -

JUDGE MURASKY DECIDES
IN FAVOR OF GRAHAM
Attorneys for Contestant Costello
Will Take an Appeal to the
Supreme Court.
Judge Murasky yesterday granted the
motion of the attorneys for exrJudge
Daingerfield. who contested the election
of Judge â¢ Graham, for permission to
amend their .pleadings so that Stephen \'.
Costello will not be able under the pro
ceedings to contest Graham's peat. Tho
contest was abandoned by 'ex-Judge Dain
gerfle,ld when the recount showed that he
had no chance of overcoming Graham's
plurality. The attorneys for Costello then
asked that he be declared entitled to the
seat now occupied by Judge Graham on
the face of tho returns of the Election
Commission.
During the recount between Daingerfield
and Graham over 3500 improperly marked
ballots were thrown out, and the official
returns of the Election Commissioners
give Costello a larger vote thftn Graham
has to his credit after the rejection of
these worthless ballots. On that ground
Costello, through his attorneys, laid
claim to the coveted place. Judge Muras
ky decided yesterday that Costello had no
place In the contest, and to-day formal
judgment will be entered In favor of Gra
ham; The attorneys for Costello will take
an appeal to the. Supreme Court from
Judge Murasky's decision. I In the mean
time Judge Graham will continue to oc
cupy his place on the bench of the Supe
rior Court.
CINCINNATI. Feb. 4.â Notwithstanding
the action of Governor Nash there has
been no suspension of preparations here
to-day for, the Jeff rles-Ruhiln contest.
The work has been proceeding at the big
hall as heretofore. The sale of tickets
goes on the same as last week. The pro
grammes were carried out as usual at the
training quarters of Jeffries, Ruhlin. Mar
tin and Childs. The" Saengerfest Athletic
Club and their attcrn*ys, after repeated
conferences. Insisted that they would pro
ceed to carry out their programme unless
a permanent injunction was issued by the
courts. Arguments will be hearQ on the
petition for an Injunction to-morrow and
they may continue for two days and then
Judge Hollister may reserve his decision
for a day or two, so that the indications
to-night arethat there will be no suspen
sion of preliminary work for some days.
Directors of the Saengerfest Athletic
Association repeatedly stated to-day that
the fight would not be declared cfT until
they had' exhausted all. efforts In the
courts, even to the court of fast resort.
The promoters of the event Insist that
they will give a sparring exhibition and
come within the provisions of the Ohio
statutes for boxing contests. They Insist
that Governor Nash Is mistaken in as
suming that the event is to be a prize
fight and on this issue they expect the
courts to decide In favor of the Saenger
fest Athletic Club. I
Attorney General Sheets will arrive at 7
o'clock to-morrow morning and partici
pate with other attorneys In the argu
ments for a permanent Injunction. There
is a large array of legal taleni on both
sides.
Prosecuting Attorney Hoffheimer, In re
plying to th* letter of Governor Nash to
daV. denied that there was collusion in the
cases before Squire Roebling. in which
Jeffries and Ruhlin w^re arraigned on the
charge of training for a prize-fighr. These
cases were continued until next Monday.
Hoffheinw wrote to the Governor that if
he found^olluslon in these cases he would
have the principals arrested again and
arraigned fcefore a Judge of the Common
Pleas Court. '..
The different ministerial associations of
the city to-day adopted resolutions con
gratulating Governor Nash on his action.
At the same time the German singing so
cieties that are interested In' the Saenger
fest guarantee fund have taken action to |
the contrary-
The managers of the fight to-day came
In conflict with the Western Union and
the Postal Telegraph companies. The
telegraph companies refuse to pay the
amount demanded for the privilege of
having their offices inside the hall and
hoth agreed that they would have their
offices on the outside rather than pay the
amount demanded.
Jeffries and Trainer Delaney had a
long conversation with a Los Angeles cor
respondent to-day relative to holding the |
contest In California if the Governor of i
Ohio succeeds in stopping It here. The big ,
fellow would like to show Los Angeles
people his true work, and it is not Im
possible that Southern California may be
treated to the battle for the heavy-weight
championship of the world.
"I would bo willing to *o for a much
smaller purse In my own town, and will
try to persuade my manager to arrange
the fight there if Governor Nash succeeds i
in stopping It ' here. Los Angeles has '
never had a chance to see me much. 1
have Improved and It would please me Im
mensely to go there." said the champion.
DeVariey. who is no stranger to l*ns An
geles, concurred in Jeffries* remarks. One
thing is certain, if the fight cannot come
off here the only available States are Cali
fornia and Nevada, and the latter la
frowned upon by the managers.
When asked about California as a bat
tlefield the Akron giant professed his will
ingness to go anywhere, at any price. In
order to mÂ«et Jeffries. Ills heart Is set
on winning the laurels and the money
consideration is secondary with him
Manning was non-committal. He has not
loet hope that the legal battle will settle
the question In favor of the Saengerfest
board, but refused to say what would
happen if the fight is called off here.
It was stated late to-night that the at
torneys for the Saengerfest Athletic Asso
ciation will refer to the court the statutes
that were passed by the Legislature after
the Bourner riots here in 1884, when the
power of authority that is usually invest
ed in Sheriffs was conferred upon the
Mayors In the cities of the first grade of
the first clasa of Ohio, which applies to
Cincinnati only. In â¢ this event, it Is
claimed, the county officers will be power
less.'
Governor Nash has communicated with
county officials only and not with the
Mayor or any municipal officers. Jeffries
and everybody at his training quarters
came to the city this evening and dined
with Manager Cooke and the promoters
of the contest and ppent the evening In
conference over the situation. Represen
tatives, from the Ruhlin training quarters
were also in the city and they will be at
the courthouse as witnesses and specta
tors. '.â¢Â¦,v.;: i v;^k; Â¦Â¦> ;yt':

SIMMS AND BOYLE GIVE
VERY POOR EXHIBITION

the Fight Ends in ths First
Hound.
PITTSBHRG. Feb. 4.â Notwithstanding
the vigorous protest of the United Presby
terian Ministers" Asoclation and the
threat of Mayor Diohl that he wnuld taka

tween Art.Slmms of Akron and Frank
Boyle of Pittsburgh took place to-night in
the Ayenue Theater before a crowded
house.
So far as fighting was concerned, the
bout was a miserable failure. Before the
first round had gone thirty seconds Simma

punches In the face. Boyle got to his feet
on the count of four, but Simms soon ha<1
him on the run. and after one or two

NEW YORK. Feb. 4.â Washington Del
gado, a tall, sinewy athlete of the Young
Men's Christian Association, . defeated
Arthur Duffy, the champion sprinter of
two continents*, at the gaines of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club at Madison
equare Garden to-night. The race In
which the- Georgetown sprinter met his
Waterloo was a sixty-yard dash across
the board floor of the Garden. It was a
Special race. On the starting line on
Duffy's side were six other runners
known to possess great speed on a board
floor." Arthur Kent of the Pastime Ath
letic Club was picked out by the athletic
sharps to finish second to Duffy; but Del
gado upset all calculations". When thei
pistol cracked Duffy and Kent were off
like a team. Delgado was about a foot
behind. They raced In this position, leav
ing the others further behind at every
jump, until they had covered thirty yards.
Then the long logs and space devouring
stride of Delgado began to be felt and at
fifty yards he had passed both his rivals
and was still gaining. When he broke
the tape a yard separated him from Duf
fy, who was a foot in front of Kent.
Alex Grant represented the University
of Pennsylvania and after a" desperate
struggle with a, field of oixteen won the
halt-mile race from scratch.
There was an intercollegiate team relay
race in which. twelve" collegians took part.
Cornell, Columbia and the College or the
City of New York each Bent four of their

DOES NOT KNOW WHAT
CAUSED" COLT'S DEATH
James R. Keene Not Yet Advised
Concerning' Particulars of the
Loss of Tommy Atkins.
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.-James R. Keene.
owner of Tommy Atkins, the famous two
year-old colt which died in England on
Saturday, Is still unadvised as to the
cause of the horse's death.
To a reporter Mr, Keene said: "I do
not know exactly when Tommy Atkins
died or from what disease, for I have not
been advised from the other side as to
the particulars of the colt's death."..
Mr. Keene took the loss of the colt, from
whose performances in England he ex
pected so much, very philosophically. It
could be seen, however, that he felt the
loss of the horse more than he cared to
show.
Tommy Atkins was one of the best two
year-olds on the American turf last sea
son, and second only to Commando, in the
ntfiblo of James R. and F. P.- Keene. He
was shipped to England recently 'with
Chacornice, winner of the futurity of 1893,
and other horses. He caught cold on the
trip over, according to advices from Eng
land, died after being landed.
Tommy Atkins was . purchased as a
yearling for $4500. The colt gave such
grand promise that his many engagements
in this country were canceled and he was
elected by the Messrs. Keene to race In
England this year Instead. He was eli
gible for most of the classic. turf events
In England and France this ! season,-- In
cluding the Gold Cup,, the Ca.mbrldge
â¢ahire, the Czarewltch and the Grand Prix.
As a two-year-old Tommy Atkins ran
nine races and only once was out of the
money. "> ' . .
There wa* considerable hard feeling en
gendered over the running of . the Flat
bu&h stakes, which was Tommy Atkins*

Fire in those quarters for a change of

II. O'Neil. traveling passenger agent of
the company, arrive! from Portland to
K nk into th<j matter. It is rumored that
he TÂ«'ill make a strenuous protest against
the email percentage that his company
if- allowed. If the protest is of no avail,
Vie will start a vigorous war against the
Southern Pacific.
The method of attack will be to attempt
to Induce the soldiers by a low rate to
Â¦travel to Portland, Or., on the O. R. and
â¢N. steamers and thence East over th-!
Oregon Short Line.
On Sunday tliere wer*> 200 discharged
pr-ldi^rs landed from :hÂ«> Warren and these
m^n are now at the Presidio. The O. It.
antf N. offloia!* have r-ngaged a. number
of Folicitors. who will -start an active t-an
\aFs to try and secure this travel unless
t-Omc- immediate steps are taken.
. -Officials on both tlie. Santa Fe and the
Scuthern Pacific- railroads laugh at the
Idea of a rate wgr. They claim that the
Southern Parific is In a posiUon to freeze

A SCANT looking card and the driv
ing downpour of rain kept quite
a number of the regulars ev*n
away from Tanforan Park yester
day. It is needless to remark the
track was sloppy and that In consequence
there were a number of dumps. XJreenock,
at short odds, and Walkenshaw* were the
only favorites to win, tnough nearly all
of the successful horses were accorded
support, unless It was Periwig, which
beat out Can't Dance in the hurdle event.
The imported Esher filly Darlene, owned
by Dr. Rowell, to"ok the opening mile run
tor three-year-olds, eased almost to a
walk. Klorista went to the post favorite
over Darlene, but had enough when half
the route had been traveled. In a hard
drive, Thracia, ridden by O'Connor,
downed Kinstelle a nose for the place.
Tom Ryan's clipper rigged sprinter Goal
Runner was touted as tne genuine article
for the six and a half furlong scramble
following, closing favorite over a crowd
of fast ones. It is said Goal Runner likes
to be ridden from behind and Buchanan
certainly gave him ample opportunity to
demonstrate that fact. Cut off right after
the start, he took the gelding back, and
though doling up a deal of ground, was
just two positions shy at the wire. Tor
sina, with Mounc<? up and 6 to 1 in the
ring, won all the way, beating High Hoc
three lengths. Goal Runner bore out a'l
through the stretch. Loving Cup started,
but showed no speed.
Not long ago Periwig was unloaded on
an unsophisticated native by his former
owner because his wind was "touched"
and he wouldn't run over a quarter. The
pold brick was 15 to 1 In the betting on
the mile and three-quarter hurdle eve.it,
and practically neglected. Fencing bet
ter than a Telegraph Hill billy-goat, he
beat the 4 to 5 favorite. Can't Dance, over
twenty panels. JleFtor drifted into the
show.
Greenock had nothing to beat .for the
mile and a half purse, and. a 1 to 2 choice,
romped in first. La Borgia outstayed Rio
Chlco, taking second place Just as hand
ily. I'arda came in for steady backing,
but made no showing" whatever.
On his close third to Handicapper and
Montallade one day last week The Singer
looked cherry ripe to win the second h'x
and a half furlong: pp!h. Tommy Burns
had the mount and, although he did his
bÂ«\Â«t, was collared the last few yards and
led out a head by El Mido. Dominick
piloted the winner, which was 6 to 1 in
the ring. Xovia finished a fair third.
Right in his element, Andy Blakelev's
mudhorse Walkenshaw made short work
of his field in the mile and a sixteenth
selling run, last on the menu. Assuming
the front position so-m after the start.
Bullman got the black fellow In twj
lengths before Presiome, a 12 to 1 sho:.
Mounce, on Rey del Bandldos, took the
slmw.

Track Notes.
J. Owens, the steeplechase rider, left
for the East on Sunday.
Walter Jennings released Owen Mounce
yesterday from the contract which gave
him first call on the lad's services until
May 1. Dissatisfaction on the part of the
Jockey and his guardian because Tommy
Burns was engaged to ride Canmore on
Saturday last precipitated the action.
Ed Gaylord, the Denver turfman and
lessee of Overland Park, left for home last
week, well satisfied with his trip to the
roast. The owners of aii the bisr Califor
nia harness horse stables promised Mr.
Gaylord they would participate in the
great June meeting to be held at the
Colorado metropolis. As the entrance fee
to all running- purges has been abolish*.!
there will be no dearth of. thoroughbred
material.
Martin Nathanson, secretary of Harlem

The Tanforan association has offered to
pive another purse of $1000 If the ownern
of Canmore. Rolling Boer, Articulate and
Brutal will start their three-year-olds
again next -Saturday. Walter Jenningn has
signified hi? willingness to start Canmore
and Mr. I^opez, it -If paid, will send Ar
ticulate out again, but there l.Â« scarcely
a posolbilitv of the race being arranged.
Brutal, it I* claimed. Is no mud horse,
and th^re Is every likelihood of the truck
being heavy. Then again Rolling Boer
whs injured in the bumping match at the
post last Saturday, which will keep him

made some sacrifices; all. or nearly all,
have had clashes, it being impossible this
jrar to give unobstructed dates to many
associations, that will pet them hereafter

der took place at Rampart City, several
hundred miles below Dawson on the Yu
kon, during trie early part of December,

The prominence of the people concerned

some friends. President Colton. who is
now a resident of .Kansas City. Mo., and
who made the trip especially for the ban
quet, left to-night for Los Angeles. Two
other members reside there, and another

SAN JOSE, Feb. 4.â The students of the
University of the Pacific, the leading
Methodist College on the Pacific Coast,
are aroused over the faculty debarring
John Bovard. one of the most popular stu
dents In the school, from holding any of
fices In the gift of the student body. "This
evening they held a meeting and ap
pointed a committee to see the faculty
and ask It to reconsider. Unless this bo
done a strike of students may result.
Bovanl. who was elected editor of the
college paper, the "Workaday World, is
the son of Dr. Bovard of San Francisco,
editor of the California Christian Advo
cate and a former trustee of the univer
sity. A week ago he and Henry McKul

the school journal and the captaincy of
the track team, to which he had just been
elected. Bovard then left school nnd went
to his home. The students declare this
action of the faculty unjust and they will
keep on electing him to honors wltnin

BIG MORTGAGE FILED BY

at Centralia.
SEATTLE. Feb. 4.â A fight took place
at Centralia, Wash., yesterday, between
members of the Good Government League
and the saloon men. After the first clash
of arms, reinforcements arrived for each
party and it looked as if a general rough
*nd-'tumble fight would end the engage
ment. An armistice was finally agreed
upon and the opposing forces withdrew.
The row was the outcome of reform
agitation. For some time the saloon cle
ment and the people who would likÂ«; to
see the town free from the evil of Sunday
liquor traffic have been at sword polntp.
Yesterday the smoldering fire was fnned
to a blaze by the action of the reform
ers. As they designated it. they were
out Investigating. To assist them In their
labors they took with them a long step
ladder. Arriving at one saloon where
they suspected something wrong was go
ing on. they pjanted the ladder against
the front of the building with the inten
tion of getting a peep throuph the tran
som.
The r.olse on the outside awakened those
on the inside to the fact that danger
was near. A scout was sent out from a
back door to find out what was going on.
He reported. This made the bartender
mad, and he sallied forth with, blood in
his eye and his fists doubled up.
Just as the first investigator was about
to climb the ladder he felt' something
moving. Down went ladder, reformer
and all. The bartender was surrounded,
but he started in to fight the whole crowd.
This was unexpected and caused conster
nation in the ranks.
In the meantime saloon men and re
formers came rushing to the scene. The
two forces were- ready to clash, but wis
dom prevailed and the fight was declared
a draw. . _ â¢

It has been ascertained by a reporter > that the follo-wlne people of na-

Congressman Howard, of Alabama, says: "I have taken Peruna for the

Congressman White, of North Carolina, says: "I find Peruna to be an
excellent remedy for the grip. I have used it in my family and they all Join
me In recommending It."
JIIss Frances M. Anderson, of "Washington, D.C., daughter of Judge An-
derson, of Virginia, says: "I was taken very 111. with the grip. I took Peruna
. and was able to leave my bed In a week."
Mrs. Ilarrictte A. S. Marsh. President of the "Woman's Benevolent Asso-
ciation, of Chicago, writes: "I suffered with grip seven weeks. Nothing

never be without It again." â
' At the appearance of the first symptoms of grip people should stay In-

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
' Editor Cali: In your editorial, entitled
"Bishop Potter's View," printed in The
Call of January 29, you make a grave and
startling statement It is that "the treaty
clause permitting Christian missionaries
to operate outside the treaty ports and to
enter and own compounds in the Interior
(of China) was forged," and' you further
assert that this forgery in the treaty of
1S60 was perpetrated by "a Christian mis
sionary-"
Now with the main coniention of that
editorial the writer hereof has little fault
to find. Your criticism of looting soldiers,
whether German, French or American, is
entirely right, and is no doubt timely.
But the assertions and assumptions run
ning through that editorial to the effect
that the present awful conditions in China
are in any large sense chargeable to the
acts of Christian missionaries are unwar
ranted by any facts that have come un
der tho writer's notice. If the editorial
means to assert that so-called Christian
nations are to blame for the patriotic up
rising in China, which unhappily and un
wisely culminated in the "Boxer" out
rages, the future historian will no doubt
fully indorse your view. But if it is in
tended to assert tnat Christian missiona
ries as a. class are to blame evidence Is
entirely wanting that will confirm your
position.
It' may be freely granted that the suc
cess of Christian missions In that ancient
land has astonished and finally alarmed
the followers of Confucius, and that more
or less of persecution always arises when
Christianity first begins powerfully to in-
fiuence the public mind In any pa^an
country. And it is perfectly clear to any
careful student of the facts that it was
the young Emperor's conversion to West
ern ideas and his perhaps ill-timed move
to introduce- Western educational idea's
and methods. Into the Imperial schools
that caused the reactionary usurpations
of the Empress Dowager. And of course
inasmuch as the Christian missionaries
are largely, if not mainly, to be credited,
with thejntroduction of modern scientific
education in the empire of China. It is en
tirely natural that they should in the
Boxer thought be chargeable with all this
movement that. In their deluded minds,
portends such dire results to their father
land. Hence the effort to exterminate the
missionaries and â¢ their converts, along
with all other "foreign devils." The
Cbri3tian missionaries, I suppose, would
in this sensÂ© he entirely -willing to be
charged with being the cause of the pres
ent troubles in China. It is the usual re
sult of the first triumphs of the Gospel of
Christ In any land hitherto under the
sway of other religious ideas. But this 13
far from indorsing "forgery, vengeance*
and slaughter," whether in China in tho
year 1901, or In any other land and age.
The case -Is so important, and your as
sertion is so serious, Mr. Editor, that I
trust you will in your next Issue either
withdraw the accusation that "a Chri3
tlon missionary" committed forgery in
connection with the treaty of 1SG0, or else
give your readers the name of this "Chris
tian" forger,- together with all. the facts
and authorities in the case.
Trusting to your sense of fair play, I
am" respectfully- yours,

PERSONAL MENTION.
IT is announced as certain that the President of the
United States will deliver a commencement ad
dress at Berkeley in May. This will make it the
red letter commencement in the history of the insti
tution.
Seen in all its significance there can be no more in
spiring incident than the presence of the President
His lot in life was cast in common with that of a vast
majority of his countrymen. Born into that happiest
of all conditions, the need of personal exertion to
achieve his career, throughout his youth he helped
maintain the frontier home of his parents, minded duti
fully all the obligations of son and brother, wrought
patiently with his hands and was a helper in all the
humble enterprises and simple ways that were needful
in that good Western life of a half century ago.
Emerging from toilful youth, strengthened anil
equipped with self-denial and independence, he pre
pared for the profession of law, and went forward from
that to honorable public preferment, carrying with
him always the stout heart, ingrained integrity and
personal independence that were the endowment of
his early experiences. As member of Congress, Gov
ernor of his State and President, he has offered to
his young countrymen a worthy example to be fol
lowed with honor.
As he stands before the twenty- five hundred stu
dents at Berkeley every young man may see in him
and his history the impressive possibilities which are
open to them all. Every mother will see what she
most devoutly wishes her son to become, not in the
elevated station only, but in the character which has
earned that station by deserving it.
In this honorable matter, so rich in benefits to the
student body and through it to the State, California
has certain duties which cannot be neglected with
credit. When President McKinley stands on thit
campus he should not be the guest of a pinched and
starving university. Faculty and students should no:
feel like a charity school, tattered and groveling for
a pittance of cash or cringingly grateful for notice in.
its forlorn and disinherited condition. â¢ The univer
sity should'that day rear high its crest as the chief
pride of the State, jeweled with the public confidence.
haying in its treasury the power, that commands the
best teaching. talent .to be had, and able to assert its
claim that none excel it in an equipment to do the
best work in training the best minds that can come to
its halls.
In default, of. the right to be in that attitude there
will be sonic' shame in showing our commercial great
ness, the variety of our resources, the accumulated re
sults of our great wealfli'and the alluring promise of
our future. : The sun that shines on mountains and
plains, bathing . orchard and vineyard in its kindly
warmth, will be clouded to the dear eye of a states
man who knows the power of knowledge and theiduty
of the State to create arid; conserve; that power!
.;, The Legislature is .very properly concerting 1 official
SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY.
AN evidence that along with the materialism of
the age there has been a steadfast development
of "genuine humanity, is. to be found in the
rapidity with which sanitariums for consumptives are
being established since first the alafm over the spread
of the disease led to the closing of many health resorts
against them. It is now quite clear that consumptives
will not find the healthier regions of the world bar~ed
against them. Ample sanitariums will soon take the
places of the hotels, and in all probability the new
order of things will be better than that of the old.
It appears that the first sanitarium of the kind wa3
established in Austria and achieved a notable success.
Germany, noting the good accomplished- by the Aus
trian experiments, established similar sanitariums
within . her borders. Massachusetts followed the
European example and New York was quick to profit
by the lesson. A little later a sanitarium was estab
lished near Philadelphia, and now the Legislature of
Minnesota has under consideration a bill setting apart
a tract of land for a sanitarium and appropriating
$150,000 for the buildings and $50,000 annually for
operating expenses.*
The Minnesota measure is being strongly advocated
by the Chamber of Commerce and otlfer influential
organizations. It has been stated by the advocates
of the bill that in Minnesota more than twice as many
people die from consumption than from any other
disease. It is believed furthermore that with proper
care the disease is by' no means incurable, and that
therefore the proposed sanitarium will be one of th?
most beneficial institutions of the State.
It is in the highest degree gratifying to note the
progress of a great movement of this kind for the
good of afflicted humanity. It is a proof that in the
eager pursuit of wealth our people have not. become
indifferent to the best impulses of the heartland in
many of our commonwealths at any rate are willing to
share the expense of helping back to health those
upon whom disease has fallen.
SANITARIUMS FOR CONSUMPTIVES.
Last but not least, let us keep our
worthy universities out of politics and
confine their examinations to their own
students, which is legitimate, and causes
no dissatisfaction.
A. VAX DER NAIL-LEX JR.,
Licensed State Surveyor. Deputy TJ. S.
M. S. and Ex. TJ. S. Deputy Gov. Surv.
San Francisco, February 2, 130L
County Surveyors of their respectivo
counties for twenty years and' over, to
submit to an examination before a board
of university professors? Would the pro
fessors be qualified to tell such surveyors
whether they shall continue their profes
sion or not? It would seem to me like a
grand farce if such should ever coma to
an issue,- because we know that any of
the above surveyors knows more about
the surveying In their respective counties
than all the official professors of the State
put together.
A bill similar to the one seeking- recog
nition has been Ignored, and voted down
by three preceding Legislatures. The act
relating to the licensing of land 'survey
ors, approved March 31. 1S91. and now in
force, is perfectly satisfactory to the
great majority of surveyors in California
and no State in the Union can show sud
a competent corps of surveyors as we
have here in California. : â¢
This new bill would also create an ex
pense to the State for salaries, whereas
now there is none.
EDITOR CALL: Knowing that you ai^
at all times ready to devote space in your
valuable columns for the benefit of jus
tice, I have taken the liberty of sending
you the following letter for publication:
Assemblyman Schillig has (by request)
introduced Assembly bill No. 462, which.
If it became a law, would disqualify every
licensed surveyor In the State, no matter
how many years he had been practicing
his prof easion, . and would compel him to
submit to a re-examination before a board
of examiners appointed by the Governor
and composed only of professors of civil
engineering of our State university. We
have been personally acquainted with
some of these professors and know them
to be thoroughly well-learned gentlemen
and mathematicians of great merit, but

Such is the relation of the railroad to politics. The
people know it and the attention of President Hays
is directed to it. It is useless to bind the hands of the
subordinate officials so long as Herrin is left free.
If President Hays be in earnest in his resolve to take
the railroad out of politics he should at once notify
Mr. Herrin to attend strictly to the law business of
the company or leave the office.'
It is not worth while to go over the whole of the
long and shameful record of Herrin's political deals
since he became head of th; Southern Pacific law
department. Suffice it to say that ever 'since he has
been in that office he has been better known to the
people of California as a political boss and wire
puller than as a lawyer. In fact, railroad politics ap
pears to have been his business and law his pretense,
and in many instances his affiliation with the worst
elements of politics has been so open as to consti
tute a public scandal
The Southern Pacific Company will never be out of
California politics so long as Herrin, or any other
person who may be appointed to the headship of the
law department, retains the power to use the patron
age and the influence of the road in political affairs.
Herrin has been, in fact, the head center of the cor
rupting forces of the Southern Pacific Company.
The congratulations, however, must not be carried
too far. This is one of the matters in which nothing
czn be accounted done so long as anything remains
undone. It will profit the State and the railroad little
to deprive subordinate officials of authority to grant
passes on account of politics, or to restrain them
from carrying out political deals, so long as the law
department of the company continues to have and
to make use of those privileges.
L| POX good authority it has been given out that
J President Hays oi the Southern Pacific has'
taken preliminary steps toward withdrawing
the company from California politics. It is stated he
has notified officials of the road in various sections cf
the State that hereafter they will not be authorized to
grant passes to any ore on account of politics, and,
furthermore, it is asserted he has announced that
whatever political deals may have been . arranged
msst be declared off.
The authority upon which the reports are given is
sufficiently good to assure the public of their accur
acy. The information has come to The Call from a
thoroughly reliable source. So far, then, President
Ha%*s has done well, and the people of California may
congratulate one another that at last something his
been done toward relieving the State from an evil of
great corrupting power, and the railroad from a prac
tice which has aroused against it the indignation cf
the pccple Â£nd seriously interfered with its legitimate
business as a transportation company.

SURVEYORS AND THE LAW.
The Call Invites letters from the people on matters of current Interest, holding
Itself, however, in no wise responsible for views expressed therein. Communications
Intended for this column should not exceed four hundred words.
So satisfactory does the law appear to the East that
it is said bills providing for a similar system ofpri
' rrÂ»ary elections have been introduced in the Leglshi-
I tures of no less than fourteen States. Of course the
measure would not in its entirety be practicable or
expedient in California, but none the less a law thac
has proven itself so excellent after a practical test in
a large city should' not be ignored by the legislators
of any State who are seeking to devise a satisfactory
?system of conducting primary elections.
Of the working of the law at the first test it is
stated the election was a quiet one, and the votes* were
rapidly polled. At the close of the day it was found
that 32,000 citizens had registered and voted, or io
per cent more than the entire vote cav by Minneapo
lis in the last State election. It is added that within
twenty-four hours the newspapers had collected and
published the returns, and the public knew who had
been nominated without a single convention" having
been held.
Minnesota has a personal registration law. Under the
Day act tho voters of Minneapolis are afforded an op
portunity of taking; part In an official primary on the
first of tho three days of registration and'on the first
day only. The polls are open from 6 o'clock in the
morning until 9 o'clock in the evening-, and the primary
is conducted by the ordinary registration officers. When
the citizen has qualified himself for registry he has' an
option of taking part in the primary. If he so desires
he is given two slips of paper, one containing the
aspirants for Republican nomination and the ether for
Democntfic nomination. He marks the candidates of
his choice, folds the papers into one packet and returns
J.hem to the officers, who deposit them in the ballot
*>ox. At the close of the polls the packets are opened
and the ballots that are marked are counted, provided
that, where a voter has marked two ballots, that only
Is counted that has the greater number of marks. A
person who desires to get his name on a primary ticket
must secure a petition signed by names of voters to
the number of at least 5 per cent of the number of
votes cast In his party for the same position for which
he desires Â»to run at the last election, which petition is
presented to the County Auditor, together with a fee of
$10 to defray partly the expense of the ballots. The law
defines what a political party is, compels such parties
to nominate by the general primary instead of political
primaries, and makes provision for independent nom
inations by nomination papers. -
I From the reports that come to us it appears the law
worked so well in every respect that it will be worth
while for the California Legislature to give attention
to it in devising a primary. law for this State. The
plan and operation of the law are thus described by
the Philadelphia Public. Ledger in recommending the
adoption of something. like it in Pennsylvania:
/CONSIDERABLE attention is being given in
\^ th e East to a primary law whose working was
tested at the last election in Minneapolis and, ?t
is said, gave well nigh universal satisfaction. The law
was devised by' Assemblyman: Day of the Minnesota
Legislature. When -the bill, was under consideration
the Legislature refused to'' adopt it for the State at
large, andlimited its application to counties having
a . populartfSn - of over 200,000, which was tantamount
to confining it to Minneapolis.

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
Power and pomp, glory and ambition, pass and are
not, but character endures among the world's forces,
after empires, kingdoms, principalities and powers are
forgotten.
That ancient custom was derived from human na
ture, and we have just seen the whole world repeat,
in the case of this princely woman the solemn judg
ment that passed upon the -Egyptian rulers, from
Menes to Psammetichus. She survives herself in her
character. She was Queen over tens of millions, and
she was Empress over hundreds of millions, but she
paid to v.ll the world a higher duty than she owed to
the nations she ruled. From her exalted station could
have gone out immoral influences so sinister and se
ductive as to have made the world of her time another
Sodom. But hers was a white throne, and as a moral
woman of vestal character her influence had no
bounds. It was stronger than her armies and navies,
reached farther than her empire and made her the
sharer of the joys of every home where virtue anci
right living brought happiness. It was because she
shared Tightness of life and g,ood motives with good
women in every station of life, and not because she
sat upon a throne and did no more, that for one day
from sunrise to sunset the whole world ceased its
pleasures and its gain-getting and laid a chaplet on her
coffin.
Among that ancient people this custom was the
means of making a good character to be prized above
riches and honors and power. The king could lord
it while he lived, for he was king. But, dead, he was
a man only and had nothing to leave to posterity but
his character.
alike was subjected. Monarchs were spared during
their lives lest the state should suffer by accusing
them, or pointing out their sins and faults, their vices
and their follies. But when a king died he was no
more a kingâ he was a man, like other men, and had
no exemption from the judgment which raised his
memory to everlasting honor or condemned it to ever
lasting execration.
To this process the memory of king and peasant
This widespread ascription and this community of
solemn and respectful feeling did not originate in any
awe of royalty, or of distinguished descent, or in po
litical reasons. People with the most deeply seated
republican principles, and others at the other extreme
of the long catalogue of governmental forms, the de
vout supporters of autocracy, mingled in memorial
1 ceremonies and made theirs the grief of her own fam
ily and her own people. Never before in the history
cf man was such a scene. Never before did respect
for the great dead of one country pass oceans and
seas and national boundaries and the limits set upon
the dwelling-place of races and follow the sun around
the world. The Egyptians were severely just to their
dead. It was the ambition of the dying to leave a
good name, but that consolation was never given to
the undeserving. If the public voice condemned the
deeds of any person done in life, then the established
law reached beyond the grave and gave a sting to
death. When an Egyptian died the judges of the dead
embarked in a boat for the farther side of a lake on
whose shores they sat in judgment. Before them ap
peared the accuser, and if he proved that the dead had
led a bad life honorable sepulture was denied.
What occurred here was manifested at the same
hour all over the world. In the British Isles and in
thp crown colonies* of the dead woman's vast empire
there was no more fervor and profound feeling than
were shown in tUe United States and throughout the
world.
e TRIBUTE TO CHARACTER.
THE world-wide respect shown to the memory of
Victoria is the emphasis" of the first month of the
new century. In this city there was a demon
stration that 'was novel and creditable, when thou
sands of quiet people, of all divisions of the social or
der, joined in the memorial service offered in her
honor. Perhaps not one among them all had ever
seen her, and not many of them had ever seen the
land where she was born. But all paid a most sincere
and heartfelt tribute to her, and all were the better for
that impressive and public expression, which had in it
no element of personal display nor vainglory.
The acceptance by President ' McKinley is the, act
of a statesman. His great position may be utilized for
the good of his countrymen in no better way than in
the encouragement of teaming and letters.
The coming of the President and his appearance'at
commencement does not in any way increase the
university needs nor create a new duty. But it- serves
to usefully emphasize the duty of the State.
It was a stroke of genius on the part of President
Wheeler to secure the presence of the President of
the United States; now let the Legislature move for

come to the. State.

tom. He explained that the smaller mer
chants, bo â¢ long- accustomed to meeting
their accounts at stated intervals, made
preparations for the coming of the col
lectors. Mr. . Parsons also pointed out
that not 3 per cent of the smaller trades
men have banking facilities for the dis
charge of their. obligations.

The regular annual meeting of the
Board of Trade was held yesterday after
1 noon. After the reporuof President A. A.
Watkins felicitating the members on the
prosperous mercantile conditions during
the last fiscal year and giving an encour
aging forecast for the next trade year haÂ«l
been read Sanford Bennett introduced a
resolution providing f'jr the abolition of
collection days. His motion precipitated
a general debate and at times much feel-
Ing- -was displayed by the older merchants
in their defense of this time-honored Cali
fornia business custom of setting aside
two days In each month for the collection
of , bills. Mr. Bennett in advocating hi:Â«
measure contended â¢ that tne system of
sending numerous collectors scurrying
over the city, on the 13th and 2Sth of eacb
month was a relic and a tradition of '4.<
â¢and tended to confuse the office work o*
large houses. He also declared that the
system threw needless temptation in the
way of young and Inexperienced men and
was a superfluous expense to the trade.
C. R. Haydon' followed In a similar ar
gument, but. he was willing to leave mat
ters as they stood provided collectors b.Â»
used onljrin special cases where payments
were slow. He maintained that as all
Eastern accounts were settled by the uaÂ«
of checks and drafts the same plan could
be speedily established in the transaction
of local business and introduced an
.amendment to the Bennett resolution pro-

ham; treasurer, Sanford "Bennett: secre
tary, H. Ii. Smith; counsel. Joseph Kirk.
In a general review of trade conditions
the president declared , that prospects for
increased business the comine year wera
most encouraging'. He pointed out that
the great disadvantage business men have
experienced In past rears in securing
cheap and sufficient fuel has handicapped
them. The production of Â«J,G0O.00O barrels
of native oil last year, the equivalent of
2,000,000 tons of coal, and a steadily In
creasing output Is speedily remedying iha
trouble. He then reviewed the various
recommendations made by the board to
the California, delegation in Congress fa
voring or opposing legislation affecting
the State.
Walklns paid a handsome tribute to th*
efficiency of the directors and employes of
the board and thanked them for their
faithful co-operation and assistance. Dur
ing the year twelve regular and six spe

DECISIONS RENDERED
BY COURT OF. APPEALS
The Inquest held by Coroner Leland yes
terday morning into the cause of death
of , Betty L. Anderson, who died at 106
Eddy street from blood poisoning follow
ing a criminal operation, did not elicit any
facts other than those already published.
The woman, even on her deathbed, per
sistently refused to give the name of the
person guilty of malpractice. She de
clared the operation was performed by a
woman who was' neither a doctor nor a
nurse, but a friend of hers.-
The jury returned a verdict that death
ensued from a criminal operation per
formed by some person unknown.
Â¦ The brother of the dead woman, a
miner near Denver, Colo., telegraphed
yesterday to a local firm of undertakers
to take charge of the remains. Two let
ters from William Baker of Scottsville,
Cal.. addressed to the dead woman, ar
rived by mail yesterday morning, and
were opened by Coroner Leland. The
writer acknowledged himself to be the
author of the woman's trouble, and Indi
rectly the cause of her death.

BROTHERS MEET OFF THE HORN
Two Captains Exchange Greetings for
First Time in. Nine Years.
The American ship Pactolus, which ar
rived yesterday, Is a new addition to the
American mercantile " marine. " While
rounding the Horn she was partially dis
masted and at times the crew feared for
the vessel.
Captain Watt' has a brother whom he
has not seen for nine- years. The younger
Captain Watt Is master of the American
ship John McDonald, now on her way to
San Francisco from an Eastern port.
When off the Horn the John McDonald
and Pactolus were In company, Â»aml
strange to eay It was a dead calm. In all
the generations the story of two ships
"gamming" off the Horn has never been
written, but that is what the Pactolus
and John McDonald did last November.
A boat was lowered from the Pactolus
and Captain Watt paid a visit to b's
brother. They remained in company for
several days and then the Pactolus got
a "slant" of wind and drew away from
the wooden ship as though she were an
chored. Now Captain Watt Is waiting the
arrival of the John McDonald, when he
will give his brother the ha! ha!
Now in Commission.
The battleship Wisconsin is now a part
of Uncle Sam's navy. She was accepted
from Henry T. Scott by the commander.
Captain G. H. Relter, at noon yesterday
and to the sounding of "colors'* the stars
and stripes were unfurled. The Wisconsin
will probably be ready for sea in two
weeks, when she will make a cruise to
Mexico for target practice.
Besides the captain the Wisconsin carries
the following officers: Lieutenant com
mander, John B. Milton; lieutenant com
mander, II. T. Mayo; chief engineer,
Lieutenant George W. McElroy: lieuten
ants â Wiley. Williams, Senn, Vogelsang
and Blakeley, and Captain Davis and
Lieutenant Cutte of the marines. About
300 pallors and marines are aboard the
warship and the chances are that they
will have her ready for the practice cruise
next week.
Two Captains Exonerated.
Captains Bolles and Bulger. United
States Local Inspectors of Steam Ves
sels, handed down a decision yesterday
exonerating from blame Captain Liljequist
of the schooner Fearless and Captain J. J.
Shea of the Pomona for the collision be
tween the two vessels near Bollnas Point,
January 13.
"Water Front Notes.
The German steamship Eva ia once
more In hard luck. Some months ago,
Â¦while on her way from Yokohama to
Portland, she was posted as "overdue,"
but finally made the Columbia River. She
was loaded at Astoria and sailed for Eng
land. Yesterday she came In with her
pumps going 1 and about thre# inches of
water in the hold. The norther caught
her and the continuous pounding of the
ceas caused the seams to open. Insurance
men say the vessel will have to discharge
and repair before she can proceed.
The Fieamer San Jose is at anchor off
the. Mail dock. Yesterday the schooner
Ivy drifted down on her, but the damage
to "each vessel can be covered by $50.

1. Simplify each side of the equations.
2. Transpose all the terms Involving the
unknown quantities to the left-hand side

3. Simplify the equations by combining
similar terms. Â« -
4. Multiply the equations by such num

5. By adding or subtracting the two
equations obtain an equation which in
volves only one of the unknown quanti

6. Sole the equation so obtained. The
result cives the value of one of the un

can be done by reducing 14s 6d to pence

In a shilling, therefore 14s 6d=174d; 174-=-240
=.725. There are 240 pence in a pound.
Then Â£3 143 6d=Â£3.725. But this result can
be reached much more easily by the fol

Write one-half the shillings for the first
figure of the decimal; multiply the pence
by 4 for the next two figures; If the last
product Is between 12 and 36 add one, if
between 36 and 48 add two. If the shillings
are uneven add five to the second decimal
figure.
Suppose, for illustration, that the rate of

of Â£5 9s 6d. By the rule already explained
we find that this amount in decimal form

as good as cash when they reach London,
but they are cashed at a discount from

LISTS.
In many manufacturing and wholesale
establishments the making of price lists
involves a large amount of arithmetical
calculations. Suppose, for instance, that
an article costs $2 40 to manufacture, that
the manufacturer desires to make 10 per*
cent profit, and that he must allow the
buyer a discount of 29-10%. Here the list
price must be such that after a dlsctront
of 2&-10% Is deducted the price will be $2 40
plus 50%, or $3 60. A list price of $5 will
leave a net price of $3 80. The model ex
ercise given below shows how to find this
list or catalogue price:
Model Exercise.
Cost, J2 40; gain. 50%; discount, 20-19%.
$2 40=cost.
?3 60=net selling price. '
100 less 2O-10%=72. _ â¢ .. '
$3=Iist or catalogue price.
Xote â A net price of seventy-two cents
requires a list price of $1. then a net price
of one cent would require a llsf price of
$14-72. and a net price of S3 GO would re
quire a list price of J3 60X100-J-72.

It is often a very simple matter to re

large numbers. Note the following ex

427 427
S732 3732
1072 22512
225ST2
22SST2
There Is an actual savins: of one line in
both multiplication and addition. Instead
of multiplying 526 by 2 and then by 4 we
multiply by 42. The factors of 42 are 6 and
7. We have already multiplied 536 by 7 to
find the first line 3752. If wo now multiply
this line by 6 we shall pet 22512. tha
product of 536 by 42. 37i2X6=22512- If the
multiplier were 742 the method would be
the came. We would first multiply by 7
and then that product by 6, carrying tha
latter product two places to the right. Ap
ply this rule to the following exercises:
1. 876X427 6. 633X217 1L 876X633
2. 395X742 7. 27SX2T3 12. 93SX728

5. 932X32S 10. S7SX213 15. S42X723
In multiplying by a number such as 81279
the work can be shown in three lines In
stead of five. First multiply by 9. then
that product by 3 (to get 27). then that
product by 3 (to get 81).

II Eclipse iMf j. Co., Manufac'rs, Elrsin, N.T.NEW YORK. Feh. 4.â The stock market was
under the influence of the news of purchase of
control of the Southern Pacific by a syndicate
in the interests of Union Pacific. Notwith-
Ftan-iing the plain correbcration by the tape
on Friday of the rumors of the "deal." the
rpeculators were not without doubts, and the
official adraif-t-iens after the market had closed
en Friday fou!id the street In a state of un
ttreparc-iinebf, for while rumors of deals have
been thick for many weeks past, this particu
lar oi,e had not been formulated, even in the
'.magination of the tipster*. The natural con-
Mquence was a large and excited demand for
Hocks at the cpening to-day. As a result of
the accumulation of buying orders In commle
*ion offices since last Friday, there were wlden
ings in various stocks unaer the excited bid
cing of comi^tiry? bakers. They bought 12,500
f hares of 'Union Pacific upon the fall of the
market at simultaneous prices of SSTi to SS'.i,
Â»itf! *7\ on Friday nipht. The opening price
in {southern Pacific was the highest that stock
reached, felling Â»t both 47^ and 47 on the
transfer of EOM shares^ The demand came
' froni. London, and the opening price here was
.<*er.siflerabiy below the parity of that estab
lieh"d in London ttjs morning. Opinion in
Â¦Vail etrcet does not lean to the conclusion
that the rale of the :ro8d is for the benefit
of the *tTK-k Which. remains in the market, as
. 11 Â¦cor.Ftltutr* a minority stock of a road pre
' BumtfWy to be operated for the best Interests i
of tnfe Cuion Pacific. The professional specula
tors .tQ^k an active part in the market with
the advantage offered, of the large outside .de
;mand for -Mocks attracted by the Southern
Marine deal. In their manipulation to advance
-prices, one ojÂ«eraior inute a demonstrative bid
for W.OCO shares of Union pacific at 30. It was
quickly supplif-d jn a Ftngle blo<k, and as a
con?Â«?<juence L'nion l'acific ruled below thet for
the rest cf the day. The completion of the
Southern Pacific transaction caused additional
credence to rumorn of other similar transac
tions. It is highly probable also that the
likelihood of further transactions Is increased
by the fruition of this plan. The large de
mand for Atchtson and for Rock Island was
attracted !>y this possibility. The movement in
these, stocks Â«>Â«, on the ivhoje, the most con
spicuous cf the day. The advance in Atchl
son reached 3*Â» and in R.nck Island 2r4 on very
larEe dealings. The movement Jn Uiuisvllie
. mpparently Â«Â«s based on the fÂ»ct that It has
had no considerable rise rin.-e Us dividend has
been increased. The rise in the railroad list,
Â¦whfrh was very general in sympathy with
these movements, invited heavy realizing, and
the bull speculators turned their attention to
other quaj-ters of the list to sustain the mar
ket. The most conspicuous rise of this opera
tion was shown in the local tractions, Brook
lyn Transit and Manhattan rising Z% each and
Metropolitan 2Vj. There was a period of ac
â¢ tivity and strength In the steel stocks which
lifted them from 1 to 3Â»Â». Rumors that threat
ened conflict in the Fte^l trade had been avert
ed by egreement helped the movement. The
Â»-hol* rr.arkr t was inclined to run off In the late
dealings on realizing and the closing waÂ«
rather eaajr. Although the speculation for the
rise was very confident, counter consideration*
m-ere not entirely lo-t Â«siÂ«fht of. The fact that
a considerable rt*e In Ftocks predicated on ex
tentive consolidations had already occurred,
the possibility of popular disapproval leading to
hostile legislation.- the price paid for the roads
cbsorbed and the r^ot-sibllity of damage to the
roafis -not included leading to rivalries and
reprisals were ail discussed, 'although they re
ceived small credence. The Inroad* upon the
money market shown by last week's enormous
loan expansion as a result of the heavy flnan
oisj operations, frfves rcme weight to expecta
tion of future developments in the money
market. Sterling rxchange Continued to ad
vance, notwithstanding an easier money mar
ket In London and the porsibilitjr of guld ex
ports this week ia etill considered.
The bond market was strong and slightly
Tnore active than on Friday. Total sales uar

CHICAGO. Feb. 4.-Wheat for the greater
part of the FesEirÂ»n was dull. May opened
s iÂ®iÂ£c lo-ner at 75H^75^jc, under th^ Influence
of lewer cableB, heavy Northwest receipts ac
lurnulated since Friday and a bearish set of
world's statistics. A recovery to 75Hc took
l-lcce durincr the forenoon on buying by a
l-rominent ojioratcr and some purchases . by
scalpers. The market v.-as sustained at Uhls
recovery by a visible decrease of 1.C24.OOO bush
els and talk of export sales for a time, but
outside support was lacking and exportei3 re
ported only two loads taken and . May later
draped to 75@73Hc and closed heavy, *;c
lower, at 75V<c.
Corn- was quiet but remarkably firm in view
of the wheat weakness. The crowd was Ken
crally bullish on the small contract Mocks
ana. good cash demand for No. S. May closed
a shade higher at MU@39Hc
Tl-ere was enly a urr.all local trade in oats,
liut the market held firm, more from lack of
f filing: pressure than from, any demand. The
r-rmnfss with which gome alleged long lines
nrfc held still Influenced the market. May
iloF.ed a shade up at 2rÂ»UG25%c.
Provisions were dull but firm on a light run
of hops. May pork closed Tfac higher., lard

COMEDY IN THE AMBTTLANCE
A Doctor's Story of a Man and a
.Woman Each With a Broken Leg.
"When' I was an ambulance surgeon."
said me young family physician," "I used
to start like a fire horse at the sound of
the call. I was .lust as much interested
In the work at the end of two years as
I was the i.ay I bej?an. It was the ex
citement of the life that made me so fond
of It I had all sorts of experiences at
all sort: of hours. There was an element
of danger In It, too. but that only added
Â°"One night I had a call from the West
Side In the neighborhood pf Chelsea
Square.' It was for a drunken man who
tell down and broke his leg. On the way
back "to the hospital .with him I picked
up a drunKen woman to whom a- similar
accident .iad. happened. There was noth
ing to do but put = her In the ambulance
along with the man.
"After that the ride across town was
Â«xcltlng enough for a cowboy. At first
the patients' sympathized with each other.
Then they be^an to cry In chorus. , At
Broadway they, fell to kisslngeach other.
At Third nvenue they were fighting like
a pair, of Kilkenny cats, and I had my
hahds fullln keeping them apart. The
woman -had scratched . the man's face
dreadfully, and ho had nearly closed hÂ«r
eye with a punch, When we ptruck the
asphalt In Twenty-sixth stre<Â»t they were
Â¦Fl- Ing 'We Have All Been. There Before.
Many a .Time,' and .such -singing! The
uproar attracted a 'crowd.- who evidently

OAKLAND, Feb. 4.â Guarded by
dark and swarthy members of a
mourning tribe of wanderers, the
body of Walter Boswell, prince of
the Palmer gypsies, rests In a
rich and elegant casket that wouid grace
a nabob's bier. In the strangely con
trasted group of flimsy tents, their can
vas sides barely shedding the dripping
rain, a picture of wildness is presented to
the eyes of those who pass the nomads'
camp at Spring and Adeline streets. In
spite of every evidence of poverty nnd
lowly habitation, the funeral of the dead
tribesman will be conducted with all -of
the ceremonial of tho highest ritualism
of the Church of England. They gypsy
followers of the departed leader will fol
low the remarkable customs of their or
ganization, and will give'. a burial which
represents the very best of undertakers'
art. combined with the solemn services
for the dead.
Â¦ The funeral will be held to-morrow
afternoon at 10 o'clock, and the officiating
clergyman will be the Rev. Martin N.
Ray, rector of St. John's Episcopal
Church of this city. For years the
Palmer tribe have made their head
quarters in Oakland, no matter where
they roamed. Out In Mountain View
Cemetery there Is a large plat bought
many years ago by the Palmers. Here
were laid at rest the king. Hameline. and
his queen, and the dead prince's grand
parents, with others of the tribe who have
long since passed away. Here also will
be buried the body that now awaits the
last rites.
'Strange customs mark the gypsy life
of these wanderers upon the face of the
earth. The half a dozen tents where the
BoswellR make their home are tightly
closed against all comers to-day. In the

Oriental standards of her swarthy lover

Nalbandain was a member of a troupe
of Turkish dancers that showed In Oak

In their sorrow.
The history of the Palmer tribe of
gypsies Is shrouded in deep mystery.
More than three score years ago Hame
llne Palmer, the dead king, came from
England, a descendant of those roving
wanderers that for hundreds of years had
strolled over the country without any
home but the spot upon which they
pitched their camp. Eventually the fore
runners of the present gypsy tribe broke
up into various bands, scattering through
out the United States. They married and
Intermarried. The offspring was numer
ous, hut strange, to relate the ties of
blood were, strong enough to withstand
all of the inducements* of society and do
mesticity among which many of the chil
dren had been born. There is not of
record among those nomads the case of a
single descendant of the old Palmers who
has forsaken the tribal relation, or aban
doned the tents of the family during a
period covered bv an ordinary life.
The gypsy prides himself upon his sta
tion. Walter Boswell. the dead prince.
was no exception, tie was born th'rty
five years ago while the parents vere
making a temporary camp at Stock. on.
He was reared In the camp and grew to
manhood. Blood told, even If It was
gypsy blood, and Boswell was as true to
the customs of his people as were any of
his ancestors. The young man had talent
as a musician, and by that oursult he con
tributed to the support of the camp of
which he was a member. When the spirit
moved the gypsy clar.s moved and from
town to town they have traveled these

many years, eking out an apparently pre
carious existence by their horse trading,
fortune telling and bartering.
The Palmer gypsies are reputed to have
wealth. Certain It Is they have always
been able to make- a lavish display at the
funerals of their dead. When King Ham
eline died suddenly in San Francisco seven
years ago he was accorded a burial that
would have done credit to a Lakeside mil
lionaire. He made a fortune in horse
trading and was accounted a clever spec
ulator. At the race course he was a strik
ing .figure and the story runs that he
turned over several hundred thousand dol
lars In his day. .
Fifteen years ago the first Queen of the
Palmers died in Minnesota â shot to death
by a renegade gypsy of another trine. Her
remains were brought to Oakland and In
terred in the cemetery plat at Mountain
View. Her body was encased in a mag
nificent bronze casket of ttnest manufac
ture.
The casket containing the remains of
Prince Walter Is almost as elegant in ap
pointment.
The fatal lllnesa of the Prince began
about three months ago at lone. Recog
nizing that he was in a serious condition,
the camp was broken there and the gyp
sies returned to Oakland After miinv
months of wandering. A superstitious re
gard for" custom and habit much as any
thing: else prompted the move. But the
disease wa* so deeply r<?oted that Boswell
slowly sank, dying within twelve hour*
after the trouble reached an acute stage.

the gypsies as can be assembled will be

throughout the State, but they are for
the most part, remote. At the sÂ»rvlcÂ»Â»
there will be a Rtrict adherence to the rit
ualistic order of the church. The gypsy of
English descent maintains a strong re
gard for the religion of his forefather?,
and he appeals to the consolation of the
church when death takes one of the tribe.

until her semi-barbarous spouse and hN
troupe had left the place. Then they gave
her passage money to reach her mother" t

Proceedings were Immediately begun for
a divorce, which was granted to-day bv
Judge Ellsworth on default of the de
fendant.
Excessive cruelty was the charge In thrÂ»
complaint and the plaintiff asked to be re
lieved of her Turkish surname. It was
so ordered.
The ordinance granting the Bay and
Coast Railway Company the right \o en
ter the city at Twenty-fourth and Illinois
streets under certain conditions, was
passed to print by the Board of Super
visors yesterday. The conditions are that
the company, in return for the franchise,
shall expend J25.CO0 in construction work
before next June; that it shall' pave the
streets over which the privilege is grant
ed from curb to curb; that other road?
must be allowed the use of the franchise;
whatever other conditions the charter
specilically imposes must be strictly ad
hered to; the road mst be completed with
in two years, and the franchise must not
be transferred to another company.
The City Attorney was directed to give
his opinion as to the legality of the ordi
nance and whether the board haÂ» the
authority to grant the franchise.
Curtis explained that the ordinance
came from the Street Committee without
recommendation, as the responsibility ol"
the promoters was involved in some doubt.
Kontana said that the requirement of
only $25,005 for construction work was *oo
small and should be increased to $250 000
for a road which would run to Santa
Cruz.
Attorney Baggett. representing the com
pany, argued that the $25,008 guarantee
was sufficient, as it would be a substali
tial beginning of the construction of the
toad.
"We are acting In the utmost good
faith." said Mr. Haggett. "and the money
to build the road is ready, though only
$11,000 has so far been â¢ subscribed. We
have not yet acquired all the right of wcy
in other counties. The first important
step is to raise the money and then we
should get the right to enter the city or
our road will be of no value. After that
we will get material and bonuses from
other counties. I cannot divulge the
names of the promoters of the road, as I
do not know them myself."
The Mayor explained that Eastern
brokers were pager to acquire the legal
privileges before promoting the project.
His Honor argued that the road would bo
a good thing for San Francisco, as It
would Invite competition.
Braunhart Introduced a resolution,
which was referred to the Judiciary Com
mittee and provides for the transfer from
the School Department to the. trustees of
the Free Public JJbrary the easterly sev
enty feet of tho lot at the northwest cor
ner of Clara and Tourth streets*, and to
the Police Department the westerly eighty
feet of the lot. Hrrunhurt stated that
Mayor Phelan has expressed his intentlr-ti
to pay for the erection of a branch library
on the lot. The westerly portion will ulti
mately be used as a site for the Southern
Police Station.
An ordinance granting permission to the
street railway company contracting io
convey street sweepings to Golden Gate
Park, to construct tracks from the bunk
ers at Bryant and Eleventh streets to cer
tain designated locations, was passed to
print.
The board adopted a resolution memo
rializing the United States Senate and
House of Representatives on behalf .if
California to pass without delay the bill

aid for the exposition to be held in
Charleston. S. C, from December, 1901, to

The City Attorney was asked to inform
the board as to the richt of the Board of
Works to award private contracts for
street work; also as Jo the power of tho
Supervisors to Rrant a lot on O'Farrfll

SON OF THE WHEAT KING TAKES
UNTO HIMSELF A FAIR BRIDE
Kisses Young Grandson and Then
Disappears â Daughter rinds
Body Suspended From
Bafters in Barn.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. 1118 Boardway, February 4.
After kissing his little grandson . fare
well, aged II. H. Lawrence, father of
former Justice E. L. Lawrence, went to
a shed at the rear of his residence, 562.
East Fourteenth street, this afternoon
and hanged himself.
The old gentleman was missed by His
wife, and a daughter, Mrs. Harriet E.
Drummond, went in search of her father.
Shfi found the body dangling from, a
rafter in the barn. Rushing- back to the
house she summoned another sister, Mrs.
Mabel A. Post, and the women cut the
body down with a pair of shears.
Dr. \V. J. Wilcox. whose office is across
the street, hurried to the house in re
sponse to a call, but the aped man was
dead before relief could be giver him.
The body was discovered at 4 o'clock.
Half an hour before the old man had
been conversing with his wife and daugh
ters easily and naturally. There was not
the slightest indication that he contem
plated suicide. Just before he started out
of the house he called his young granO
son, Warren Lawrence, to his side ami
affectionately kissed the little* fellow,
making some inaudible expressions. This
action did not create an Impression upon
the observers. They knew of the grand
father's strong attachment for the hoy
and. his frequent manifestations of love
were too common for this one to excite
more than a passing notice.
After he had been out of the house for
some time Mrs. Lawrence's attention was
called to his prolonged absence.
"See what has become of papa," she
said to Mrs. Jlrummond.
The daughter could riot find him in the
house and then went out to the shed oniy
to make the horrifying discovery of the
suicide. Mr. Lawrence had placed a lad
der against the side of the barn, cllmbod
to the rafter, and after fastening a rope
to the beams, noosed It around his neck
and jumped off.
The distracted family oannof account
for the tragic deed, except on the grounU
that it resulted from the old man's .de
mented condition.
Mr. Lawrence was 75 years of age. For
a year or more ho had given Indications
of an unbalanced mind. Dr. Sill, tho fam
ily physician, was authority for the opin
ion that his patient, whom ho had treated
for a year, was insane.
The Coroner took charge of the case.
Tho deceased was a native of N>w York.
He had lived in this city for many years.
Before his retirement because of failing
health. Mr. Lawrence had been in the
real estate business. ' .

Importance of the Food Cure.
To discover a food that will cure a ner-
vous wreck Is Jnderd a Godsend. Mrs.
Ptr-lla rmal, 1227 West Thirty-first street,
Los Amrrlcs, fal., had a very rrmarkable
experience. She say.Â«: "About twelve
years ago I war, run over by a carriage
and my pplne injured. My left arm was
partially paralyzed, walking was difficult
find I had continual pains and aches In
my whole bodv. ; - : -.
"To induce a movcmr-nt of the bowels.
I Invariably had to resort to mechanical

the non-digestion of the starch of the
food. My hrart was no weak that at
timfs no pulse could â¢ be felt, and It
farmed at times as if I must die. I fainted
very often, fsomctlmes lying in a half
fainting condition fir hour*, unable to
move or ppeak. though conscious.
"Shortly after Xm2f Providence directed j
rr.e to buy a box of Grape-Nuts food.
wh>h i have since eaten twice a day.
"The improvement In health has been

while before my eyes and brain felt too
weak to do rtther. I can walk a long

for some time and I have no further need
of it." j

Bills to ratify Lie agreement with the
Crow Indiana of Montana and to proving
for the redemption of Hawaiian. coin at
par were defeated. About an hour was
spent on the postofflce appropriation bill
in the discussion of an amendment to re
duce the railway mail payments, but no
action was taken. . : â¢'-
Cannon opposed the Crow Indian bill.
The lands which the Government was to
purchase from the Crows, he said, wero
not worth $100,000, much less Â¦ $1,100,00),
which It was proposed to pay. "I am op
posed," said Cannon, "to buying -.any
more Â¦ gold bricks after twenty minutes'
debate on a side under suspension of the
rules," . â¢
Maddox of Georgia and Grow of Penn
sylvania also opposed the bill, which was
defeated 34 to 48.
During the discussion on the Hawaiian
money bill, Wilcox, the Hawaiian dele
gate, was asked to explain the relative
value of native and American silver in
Hawaii. He said that both circulated at
par, but that gold commanded a, premium.
Wilcox's English was broken. He was
offered time to give, his views In extenso,
but declined to do so. The bill was de
feated 70 to 55. two-thirds not having vot
ed ih the affirmative.
The Indian appropriation bill was sent
to conference. Sherman of New York,
Curtis of Kansas and Little of Arkansas
were appointed conferees. The House
then resumed consideration of the post
offlce appropriation bill. H. C. Smith of
Michigan continued his speech In favor
of his amendment to reduce railway mall
payment.
Without action on the amendment the
House at 5:25 adjourned. '
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.-The House to
day passed the Senate bill to adjudicate
the . claims oi United . States citizens
against Spain, which- tho Government of
the United States assumed by the treaty
of Paris, after having amended the bill
so , as to; refer the . claims to the Court of
Claims instead of to a corrtmission. A
strong effort was made to vote down the
amendment and pass the original bill,
which created a commission to pass upon
the claims, but the advocates of this
course were defeated by a majority of 35.

Shortly after 2 o'clock Bacon took the
floor and spoke on the right of the execu
tive departments to refuse information
usked for by the Senate.
At 3 o'clock the ship subsidy bill was
laid before the Senate, but was temporar
ily put aside in order to permit Bacon to
continue his speech on the executive pre
rogative. - At 6:05 the Senate went into
executive session and soon thereafter ad
journed.
The Senate resumed its sitting at 1
o'clock,, and Rawlins presented the cer
tificate of election of Thomas Kearns as
Senator' from Utah to fill a vacancy.
Kearns was escorted to the president's
desk by Rawlins and the oath of office
was administered by President Frye.
Kearns was assigned a seat- on the Demo
cratic side of the chamber, where a num
ber of other Republicans are located. His
desk was ornamented with a wreath of
American Beauty roses.
"I object," said Jones of Arkansas.
"I've Just counted the Senate, and I wjll
Bay to the Senator that it would be rather
unfortunate for him if a vote were taken
at this time."
After some discussion as to whether leg
islative business could be transacted un
der the terms of the agreement by which
the Senate met, the Senate decided that it
could not. and a motion was carried that
the Senate proceed immediately to the
hall of the House.
Just before proceeding td the House,
President Pro Tem. Frye, who is the man
ager of tho subsidy bill in the Senate, re
marked Jocularly: ,
"Senators, I should like to take a vote
on the- shipping bill now." (Laughter.)
The joint resolution providing for the
appointment of three Senators arid three
Representatives to make arrangements
for the inauguration of the President and
the Vice President was taken up. On
motion of Spooner It was amended by
striking out Vice President and- then
passed.
A resolution of the California Legisla
ture inviting the members of the Senate
to witness the launching of the battle
ship Ohio at San Francisco in the spring
was read.- â¢; .
Spooner gave notice that he would re
ply to Bacon at some opportune time,"
when it would not interfere with the ship
ping bill or other pressing measures,
Allison then called up the District of
Columbia appropriation bill, the shipping
bill being laid aside Informally to permit
progress .on the appropriation bill. At 6
o'clock the District bill was laid aside.
Bacon thought it important that the dig
nity, and authority and power of the Sen
ate should be maintained.
"1 do,' most, emphatically," replied Ba
con. ;"It constitutes such a challenge as
requires an answer from the Senate. This
Is veryj much enlarged in gravity by' the
fact that newspaper publications Indicate
it- as not only the action of the President,
but the action of the Cabinet, and we are
now confronted with the fact that there
is a general and organized purpose of the
Cabinet, as avowed, to deny to the Senate
the. right of information to be found on
the files of the department unless the
chief of the department may, as a matter
of grace, send in his permsision to permit
the Senate to have such information."
Spooner aBked .Bacon ' iL he considered
the .President's . communication a chal
lenge. . â¢' Â¦ : â¢ -Â¦ Â¦ - . -
Bacon of .Georgia addressed the Senate
upon his resolution declaring.lt to be the
sense.'Of the -Senate that that-body had
the right to demand information and doc
uments on file in" the executive depart
ments. He had made the resolution Im
personal,, he said, but h'. predicated much
of what he said upon the recent refusal of
the Secretary of War, through the Presi
dent, to supply to the Senate the report
made by\Audltor Lawshe concerning the
Cuban postal accounts. Bacon said the
refusal in the Lawshe case was a direct
challenge of the Senate's right to call for
or secure official documents.
Pettigrew declared the . whole trouble
arose because the President and Secretary
desired to promote- Sampson.- who. he said,
was not In the battle, over Schley, who
did the, fighting. -.The administration, he
said, seemed to promote men who did not
fight during the Spanish .war. Â¦ Â¦
Teller criticized the publication - of the
letter, and said the Secretary knew how
to communicate with. the Senate if he de
siredttp do so. . ' .
Morgan said he did not know the letter
got into print.* 'Â¦Â¦-.â¢ .
At the instance of Chandler the Senate
passed a resolution calling upon the Sec
retary of, the Navy for a list of members
of Admiral Sampson's fleet whose names
were sent to the ' Senate for promotion
during-:' the-- Fifty-fifth Congress. This
closed the incident.*
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.-The Sampaon-
Schley controversy was precipitated in the
Senate " by | Chand ler, who read ; and criti
cized the recent letter- of Secretary Lena
to Senator Morgan .explaining 'Why the
officers and men -of the. Santiago fleet had
received no reward i for their good work.
Hale explained what had been done for
the naval \ officers, and . referred . to \ the!
names sent: in "during the last Congress.
He said that owing to the Sampson-Schley
controversy they, could not be acted upon

WASHINGTON, Feb.^.-Secretary Root
"has made answer to thÂ» Senate resolution
calling â¢ for a statement as to why the
Filipino leader, Mablnl, has been deported
to Guam:
"A. Mabini, the Derson referred to."
says the Secretary, "is a prisoner of war,
captured by the military forces of , the
United States on the 10th day of Decem
ber, 1S99. While such prisoner he was
found to be maintaining correspondence
with insurgents engaged in armed resis
tance to the authority of the United
States and his placo of confinement has,
during- the past month of January,, been
changed from Manila -to Â¦ the island of
Guam." ' â¢ .
The Secretary supplied copies of the tel
egrams exchanged between the Â¦ depart
ment and the officers a.t Manila and other
pertinent papers. These telegrams are
particularly interesting. One from Mac-
Arthur, dated December 31, -ISM.' reports
the capture by scouts on December 11 of
Mabini, whom MacAnhur describes as
"A. Mablnl, ablest oÂ£ insurgents, founder
of late government." ,
Next follows this complete dispatch
from MacArthur not heretofore published:
"December 25. 1900â Manilaâ Adjutant
General, Washington: Expectations,
based on result of election, have not been
realized. Progress of pacification appar
ent to me but still very slow.. Condition
very inflexible and likely to become
chronic. 1 have therefore Initiated a more
rigid policy by issue of proclamation en
joining precise observance of laws of war,
with special reference to sending'supplles
and information to the enemy In the Held
from towns occupied bv our troops and
also warning leaders that intimidation of
natives by kidnaping or assassination
must sooner or later lead to their trial tor
felonious crimes unles3 they^became fugi
tive criminals beyond the jurisdiction o?
the United States, which later course
would mean lifelong expatriation. Procla
mation well received, but country expect
ant and awaiting practical application
thereof. Am ; considering expediency of
closing ports of both Camannes, Albey,
Samar and Leyte. Would like to empha
size new policy by deporting to Guam at
early date a few prominent leaders now
in my hands. Request authority accord
ingly. Pro-American natives. Manila,
v.'ith Chief Justice at the head, have or
ganized party, which apparently has some
elements of cohesion and usefulness.
Field movements outlined in my message
of October 20 probably will be somewhat
interrupted by early return of volunteers.
It is difficult to convince people, especial
ly natives, that any of the volunteers will
be replaced. Early information of pur
pose of department in regard to army leg
islation and the prospect of the passage of
an array bill would greatly strengthen 'my
administration here. MacARTHUR."
In the telegram to AlacArthur, dated
December 25 last. General Corbin author
izes him to deport insurgent leaders to
Guam, to be delivered to the naval of
ficer in command. An incidental state
ment in this respect or some importance
is that Secretary' Root does not approve
of closing ports in Camarines, Albey,
Samar and Leyte. ,
In a communication of the same date
to the Secretary of the Navy, Secretary
Root recites General MacArthur's appli
cation for permission to deport the in
surgents, and asks Secretary Long to in
struct the naval commandant at Guam
to receive the prisoners. He says:
"Substantially the same plan as recom
mended by General MacAsthur has been
discussed by. United States and. our con
clusions approved by the President."
The necessary orders were given and
the Rosecrans sailed on January 16 for
Guam with thirty-two deported , insur
gents.
On the 25th of last month MacArthur
was called upon for a reply to the Senate
resolution and this came in the shape of
the following telegram; â¢- Â¦ Â¦'â¢> â¢
"MANILA, Jan. 26, l&Ol.-Adjutant Gen
eral, Washington:' Mabini deported, a
most active agitator, persistently and de
fiantly refusing amnesty and maintaining
correspondence with the insurgents in the
field while living in Manila under protec
tion of the United States; also for of
fensive statement in regard to recent pro
clamation enforcing- laws of war. His de
portation absolutely essential.
"MACARTHUR."
The Secretary concludes his communi
cation with a copy, of the regulation of
the army of date January 16, 1832, includ
ing articles 79, 80 and 90, defining as
prisoners of war. and among them "any
civil- officer whose services are of im
portance to the enemy,"- and declaring
them "subject to such confinement or re
straint as may be deemed necessary,"

RAILWAY TRAVEL.SCENE FROM "TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES," ACT 2, AT THE CALIFORNIA THEATER. TESS (MRS. MINNIE
MADDERN FISKE). ANGEL CLARE (MR. GILMORE)-NOW I AM GOIKG TO WRITE MT NEW NAME "MRS
ANGEL CLAHE."
Of Â¦ Nell. G Wynnes young and Nell Gwynnes
Old, Â¦ Â¦â¢ = Â¦ ' Â¦
Of Nell Gwynnes hot and Nell Gwynnes cold,
Of Nell Gwynnes tender,. Nell G Wynnes tough,
We thank the Lord we've had enough! ;
That is,, since .the pretty. Planquette
opera of the name has been revived at the
Tivoli, for we have had here no less than
three Nell Gwynnes within . as many
months.
A very well cast and well sung perform
ance of this charming little opera .was
given last night at the popular opera
house, and in spito- of the rain attracted
a fairly sizable audience.
The Tivoli forces are well suited all
around in the opera. Hartman has an
excellent part: as the consequential big
wig, the beadle, and his make-up, Cyrano
nose and the pompous rest of it, is an In
spiration. It does not occur to one to
wish here, as sometimes, that the come
dian had appeared in three volumes in
stead of one, and that two of him could
be put on the shelf while we enjoyed the
otherâ there's just enough of his inimi
table self Jn the play.
Weasel, tho village pawnbroker and
miser, affords a good opportunity to that
very clever comedian. Edward Webb, and
he does excellent work In, tho role.' Arthur
Boyce's light, fine voice is well heard in
the part of Kalcon: and Tom Greene in
the dignified Buckingham's part, and
human could resist s-uch. an appeal as
that, coming from such a source? Yet
we are asked to believe that a good man,
an educated man, a man of fine and com
passionate nature,, did resist such an ap
peal and left the poor girl who made it
to : starveâ for that! Is what it came to.
No, no, Mr. Hardy; revise yourself, range
yourself as our French friends would -say,
and give us no more prigs for heroes.
The third act Is a collection of squalid
horrorsâ the mother selling her daughter,
the gin-soaked Marian lying to her friend,
the *ile Alec bargaining for his mistress
as he would a sack. of potatoes. This is
as ba-d and as unfit for representation as
anything in "Zaza." What are American
parents about in allowing their girls to
see such things?â for there were many
young girls at the theater last night, who
ought to have been at home, tucked up
in their little beds or saying their prayers
at mamma's knee. \
The first scene of the fourth act shows
Tess living as Alec's mistress, the return
of Clare and the murder of Alec by Tess.
The second scene (Stonehenge by moon
light) is too brief to be effective.
Mrs. Fiske is of the School of the Re
presslonistsâa style of acting that does
not commend itself to -my incle
ment. Yet one .must say that In
the art of Repressionism Mr3. Fiske
is an adept; she gets out of it
every effect of which it is capable. Her
voice, last night, was much better modu
lated than when I heard her Iri "Becky
Sharp," and the confusing celerity of her
delivery has been happily moderated. The
manner in which she spoke the confession
in' act II was one of the most beautiful
and artistic things I have ever heard.
. Mr. Hudson, Miss Barker and Miss Lin
coln distinguished themselves in impor
tant, roles. Mr. GUmore strove manfully
with the part of Angel Clare, but was
hopelessly overweighted by the arrant
prlgglshness of that impossible character.
"Tess" is worth seeing, but Mrs. Fiske
can do so much better! Is It hopeless to
think that we may yet see her in a mas
terpieceâsomething originalâ a real play
written by a real playwright In tho full
possession of his powers and not by little
boys trying their 'prentlc* hands at
dramatizing novels?

"TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES" AT THE CALIFORNIA THEATER
ance at the Alcazar last night and. If 1>e
has not all femininity at his feet in a few
daysâwell the matinee girl will be'severe
ly to blame. A more spirituelle creation
than that presented. by Llla Convere aÂ«
Vashti Dethic has not been seen In any
production of Jones' play. Polly Stock
well won round after round of applause
for her work in the second act. where she
describes the famous "dream, scene," and
Juliet Crosby showed that she la as much
at home In a role calling for dramatic
force as she is in, light comedy. The pro
duction held the large audience speu
bound. It is worth a visit to the Alcazar
to witness the thrilling scene In the sec
ond act, where Miss Convere totters to
the top of a steep flight of steps and
sways backward, until a shudder passes
mrough the audience.
Belasco & Thall's Central.
The latest London melodrama. "A
Daughter of the Million." in four thrill
ing acts, by Clarence Burnette. was pro
duced last evening to a delighted audi
ence at the Central. It Is quite chaste
and pleasing. The stage does not swim
in goro as in the ordinary, melodrama â
in fact, only four or five revolver shots
are fired in the whole piece. A detective
is shot, but recovers In the receiving hos
pital, and a clergyman and a boy are
stabbed. Effle Darling, the gypsy, and
Howard Hall as Adam Dare, the curate,
have the leading roles. The fun is fur
nished by James M. Ward and Frank Op
perman as Timothy Long and Toby Short
and Gertrude Clare as Mary Ann Tlp
pette. Little Norman Phillips, as "the
Shrimp." does a remarkably clever bit of
melodramatic acting and is the envy and
admiration of the boys in the gallery.
Orpheum.
Kathryn Osterman is a he'adllner at the
Orpjieum this' week, vainly trying to veil
her splendid comedy talent and infectious
laugh with an awful absurdity called "The
Widow." Miss Osterman has been here
before and it is to be hoped before she
goes she will fall back on her old suc
cesses, if there is no other way. to give
an anxious public a sample of what she
can do.
Two other new comers at the Orpheum
who scored a hit are J. K. Murray and
Clara Lane. This talented pair present
Lecocq's "Heart and Hand" in abbrevi
ated form, giving a delightful half hour
of high class musical comedy. The Em
pire City Quartet completes the list of
new comers.
The wonderful Nelsons, the Learner sis
ters, Lizzie and Vinle Daly, Warren and
Blanchard, Foy and Clark, and not for
getting the American blograph. help make
up an Orpheum programme that safely
may be labeled "the best ever."
Alhambra,
The dramatized version of Marie Corel
li's novel. "The Sorrows of Satan." at
tracted a. fair-sized audience to the Al
hambra Theater last night, notwithstand
ing the rain. His Satanic Majesty Is pre
sented In an. unusual light, which has
the effect of producing a feeling of sur
prise, followed by incredulity.

The bill at the Olympia this week Is a

successes.

This sensational statement was made by
the Rev. Frank K. Baker and the Rev. J.
N. Beard at the weekly meeting of the
Methodist Episcopal Ministers' Union.
Both the reverend gentlemen had attend
ed the mass-meeting at the Mayor's earn
est solicitation and were disgusted at the
result. Their indignation was expressed
yesterday in no uncertain terms, and the
pastors present- showed their sympathy
and feeling in the matter by their attitude
and opinions. Â¦
Dr. Board said that he did not consider
that tho meeting was a representative
one. He told of the presence of poli
ticians, toadie3 of the administration,
racetrack touts and sporting men. who
voted against the better element as rep
resented by. the clergymen and succeeded
in carrying the resolutions which were
forwarded to the Legislature recommend
ing a limited season of thirty days' rac
ing in this' State.-
Dr. Baker also told his brethren that,
notwithstanding the fact that Mayor
Phelan had a year ago expressed an opin
ion that gambling was Immoral, the ele
ment in force at the meeting was willing
and did indorse the Supervisors' action
in" passing the resolution that might re
sult in thirty days' racing in this county.
During the heated discussion of the sub
ject Miss Lake, who is in charge of the
Methodist Episcopal mission in China
town, appealed to the ministers to co
operate with her in preventing Chinese
slave erirl traffic in the Celestial quarter.
Ag a result of->ier appeal resolutions were
drawn and will he presented to the legis
lative investigating committee asking its
members to look into the condition of the
slave grirls of San Francisco.
The Rev. Mr. Ilayrett read a paper be
fore the Baptist ministers yesterday on
"The Progress Made in Doctrine. Law and
Prophecy." The Rev. Dr. Dobbins deliv
ered a scriptural talk before tho Presby
terian ministers. His subject was "What
soever He Will Have You Do. Do It." The
Rev. F. S. Parch, a returned Chinese
missionary, told of his experiences in the
Orient. The Rev. F. V. Jones deliverer
an Interesting address before, the Congre
gational Ministers 1 Union. The Rev. C. Z.
Anthony read a paper before the Metho
dist Episcopal Ministers' Union on "The
Conversion of Children." -
The ministers of San Francisco informed
their brethren yesterday that the meet
ing called by Mayor Phelan last week, and
at which the ministers of San Francisco
were invited to express their views on the
racing and gambling evils In San Fran
cisco, was nothing more than a snare and
a trap in which the clergymen were
caught.

1 According to Casserly, he had to visit a
number of "outside schools" and he
thinks that as he did not care tq walk or
ride in a street car the public that pays,
his salary ought also to pay his hack bill.-
Superintendent Webster thinks otherwise
and has decided that the bill is not a
proper one to submit to Auditor Wells.
"Eight dollars for hack hire," exclaimed
the Superintendent. "I will not stand for.
it. â¢ What do you think of babies going to
school and standing .up all day, while
School Directors ride around in carriages,
and then ask the city's depleted treasury
to pay the bills? That Is bosh. If the city
cannot g-et half-fare rates for school chil
dren, why should the Directors ride in
carriages?""
Mr. Casserly. who never entered a pub
lic school until he was appointed a School
Director, one day became possessed of
an idea with the result that he forthwith
proceeded to accumulate a hack bill
amounting to JS. This bill came under the
official cognizance cf Superintendent
Webster and was promptly "hung up. '
And , now Casserly is wroth and ori the
verge of refusing to tax his brain by cul
tivating any more ideas for the "benefit"
of the public.
"Jack" Casserly, by the grace of Mayor
Phelan- a member qt the Board of Kdu
tlon. may ride to the hounds at Blingum

serious objection being raised, but he can
not ride in cabs at the public expense
while making his rounds, if Superintend
ent Webster can prevent it.

day afternoon by Detective Reynolds.
James Jr. Is a youth of 18 years and re
cently. Trtth a few boon companions, pro
ceeded to paint the town a bright vermil
ion hue.
A salary of $60 per month as a clerk In
his father's employ did not suffice for
James Jr.'s extravagant tastes and a few
days ago -he decided to make a splurge.
James Jr. has a beautiful and young sis
ter en whom her father has lavished many
costly jewels. James Jr. set his brain to
Â¦work; that is he fct it to work between
drinks. His sister did not wear her jewels
but on very rare â¢occasions and James Jr.
decided that he could put the baubles to
better use than reclining in a jewel case-
So during the past forty-eight hours
James Jr. appropriated to himself the
aforesaid baubles, which in cold cash are
valued at $5000. With diamonds, pearls,
turquoises and other gems. in bis*-posses
sion James Jr. felt like a king of the
TransvaaL "Whoop! Ja! open another
bottle, bartender!"' And all of the friends
, of James Jr. voted him a good fellow.
"Say. Eilly." saiÂ£ JarnesJr.. "go and
Ecrak this diamond and watch for me.*'
Forthwith Billy proceeded to Interview
â¢ the g-entleman who displays the three
glided spheres as his sign of trade.
While James Jr. was disporting in a
Powell street cafe, his fun was disturbed
â¢ by Detective -Reynolds, who. in-a fatherly
manner, took him by the arm and escorted
him to a waiting hack.
â¢ James Jr was too intoxicated to under
stand what was going on. but when he
reached .the" home of his brother-in-law
. he was searched and relieved of -nearly all
the missing jewels belonging to his sister.
â¢Last night, the detecti\-es were, scouring
the tenderloin In a search for the missing
diamond pin- and jeweled watch v.ldc.'i
, James Jr. had parted with.
At an early hour this morning James Jr.
â¢was locked in a bedroom, minus his'
clothes.- but with a liberal supply of fresh
water and ice. -
When James Jr. .corner to his senses he
Â¦will be .interviewed by his; irate father,
â¢who has a choice collection of horsewhips
and rattan canfs. Â¦
In the meantim**. the name of James
Dunn Jr. has b*en erased from the list

ity as an entertaining, instructive and elo

FATHER YORKE'S LECTURE
TO AID ST. JOHN'S PARISH
IT MUST be confessed that Mr. Stod
dard has turned out a better con
structed p'ay from Hardy's novel
than ilr. Mitchell did from Thack
eray. "Tpfs"' ftaugp tog-ether better
than did "Becky Sharp"; the story is
more coherent, intelligible and impres
sive.
The first act starts the action rapidly;
Judge Conlan had three Chinese visitors
and . two white visitors on his calendar
and 'the cases were . continued till Thurs
day. .Â¦â¢.-.-Â¦. - Â¦*Â¦:â¢; â¢ - Â¦'Â¦ â¢ ' ' -Â¦Â¦-Â¦ Â¦Â¦ "â¢;.
In Judge Fritz's court two Chinese keep
ers and a Chinese; visitor : pleaded not
guilty, waived a Jury and their cases were
continued till to-morrow. .
Judge Mogran haji threo , keepers, four
Chinese visitors and seven white visitors
before him. All the cases were, at the
request of the defendants, continued till
to-morrow. Ben Floros, one of the white
visitors, was released, on his own'recog
nizance. He is employed on the steamship
Mexico and lives at 442 Green street. He
was married Friday and went toÂ»aChi
nese -lottery Saturday to : win money to
buy furniture with and was arrgsted. He
hair been In the City Prison, since, being
unable to cet bail. Ben Remarez and
Robert "Degomes had also been in prison
since Saturday arid the Judge fixed their
bail at 510 each.
In Judge Cabaniss' court two Chinese
keepers were fined $109 each, this being
an advance of $40 upon his previous fines
for the same offense, and two Chinese
visitors were fined $30 each, this also be
ing an increase in the usual tariff. In
the cases of Henry Cohean, Joseph Man
ning and George Roberts, charged with
visiting, each pleaded not guilty and a
continuance was granted till to-morrow.
George Ogle, a visitor, failed to appear,
and the Judge declared his bail of $10 for
feited and ordered a bench warrant Issued
for his arrest. The Judge sent a written
order to Warrant Clerk Peery that in fu
ture the bail for keepers must not be less
than $100 and for visitor*not Ies3 than $40,
Unless this ordor .is countermanded by
the other three Judges it will stand.

Alcazar.
The visitor at the Alcazar Theater last
evening, who witnessed the performance
of Henry Arthur Jones' problem play "f
"Judah," must have had one thought
uppermost in his or her mind. The
thought must have been. What mistake
has the Alcazar management made Jn
charging popular prices for the produc
tion of "Juclah?" Given the same produc
tion at SI 50, the whole city would be flock
ing to the doors of the theater.
For 232 weeks the Alcazar has given a
variety of plays, but none that could
compare with the performance last nignt.
Kor artistic treatment and perfection of
detail, the Alcazar production Of "JudaiV
ranks far above that given at the Bald
win, by E. S. "Willard, the famous English
actor.

Nell Gwynne is undertaken by Annie
Meyers, who is not quite at her happiest
as the frolicsome actress: Maude Wil
liams is the usurer's pretty niefce. Jessa
mine, and takes good care of the part.
Julie Cotte is the Clare. Georgie Cooper,
of "Geisha" fame, is back again at the
Tivoli.and sings and acts the part of Mar-
Jorie with a quaint and comic air. Some
of the choruses "go" with much-vim, and
the orchestra, though not always
rhythmically "there," was well balanced
in regard to weight. "The Wizard of the
Xile" will follow.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; TUESDAY, FEBRUARY o, 1901.
The second act shows Tess and Angel
married and leads up to the painful scene
where Angel ruthlessly casts off his wife
and rushes away to Brazil. In the book
this is the weak, the incredible element
in the Hardy psychology; in the play it
is even weaker and more incredible than
in the book. "Ever since I have known
you," says poor Tess, "I have gone on
loving you. How can you help going on
loving me?" What thing calling itself
it omits al! the Alec-Stoke incident of
Tess* life and takes us to the point where
she agrees to marry Clare. Tess' mother
is ingeniously made the means by which
the fatal letter carrying Tess' confession
ip prevented from reaching Clare, and the
love of the three milkmaids for the hero
furnishes a pleasant comedy sceneâ about
tha only one in the play.
