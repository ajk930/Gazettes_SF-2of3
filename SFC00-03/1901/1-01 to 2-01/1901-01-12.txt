THE IMPERIAL OWNER OF A MAILED FIST THAT IS NOW BEING

SEATTLE, Jan. 11.â Oriental mall ad
vices dealing with the Chinese Imperial
court show that there is a decided conflict:
of opinion between the Empress Dowager
and the young Emperor, who recently haa
commenced to assert* his rights. The 8u
Pao says that the' Emperor is determined
to return to Peking, but that the Empress
Dowager is just as fixed in her determina
tion not to " do so. and j that : she declares
that' she will depart- from' this scene of
earthly activities rather than again cross
the borders of Tungkwan.

EMPRESS AND EMPEROR DIFFER
"no."
In view of this extraordinary stand on
the part of America, France, Japan and
Russia, the powers which follow an In
telligent policy toward China, were
brought into line, by the old "bugaboo" of
the fear of breaking the concert.
Mr. Conger informed Washington that
he had signed the note, and was asked by
what authority. *
Conger then referred. to his Instructions,
which, he said, had reach him in- a man
gled form, but which he had not asked to
have repeated.
Secretary Hay cabled that no such in
structions were in the cipher and that he
had not given this' authority, to sign,
but, on the ; contrary! j had expressly, or
dered Mr. "Conger under no circumstances
to sign the note as long as It retained
the ultimatum form, further ordering him,
if not too late, to make good the blunder.
There was time, as the note was not
handed to the Chinese envoys until, four
days later, but during this time Mr. Con
ger made no effort to obey these instruc
tions.
It would be showing consideration for
Mr. Conger to displace him by a fresh
man, not simply, a State Department offi
cial, but a broad-gauged statesman . who
would approach the task with the con
viction that the history of the world, and
civilization depends upon the outcome.
PEKING, Jan. 10.â "While the dip
lomats are awaiting the decision
of the Emperor as to whether he
' prefers tÂ« face war with the pow
ers or rebellion on the part of the
Viceroys, the extraordinary circumstances
under which Minister Conger signed the
demands so out of harmony with the pol
icy of President McKinley have become
known. The Germans inserted in the,col
lective note the word "irrevocable,"
changing Its purport from a mere prelim
inary basis for negotiations to an ultima
tum. Japan, Russia and France were
averse to signing it, and In view of Secre
tary Hay's note to the powers nobody
thought the American Minister would
sign, and that word, of such far-reaching
consequences, would undoubtedly havo
been eliminated, as was the German
threat to invade Shansi Province, had the
American representative obeyed his In
structions. Mr. Conger, however.' threw a
bombshell Into the council of Ministers by
announcing' that he had been Instructed
to sign the. ultimatum In the "Irrevoca
ble" form, which permitted ; the Chinese
to make rid "representations and allowed
them to reply by only a simple "yes" or

the Berlin dispatch stating that the For

Washington authorities give out the
text of the German answer to the recent
American proposition, the State. Depart
ment" adheres to â¢ its first determination
that none of these answers shall be made
public,' nor Is there any desire to create
Invidious distinction by stating which
powers looked favorably, which unfavor
ably and -which held back their answers.
Now 1 that this proposition Is withdrawn
the entire subject is looked upon as a
closed incident The department has heard
nothing from Mr. Conger as (o the re
ported signing of the treaty by the peace
envoys.
. BERLIN, Jan. 1Lâ There seems no long
er, to be any doubt here that Germany de
clined the United States' proposal to sub
mit . the articles in the China agreement
relating to Indemnities and commercial
treaties to a conference to be held at
Washington or elsewhere, but It Is be
lieved that . Germany agrees to the new
American proposals for accelerating the
negotiations at Peking. The German For
eign Office, answering a direct question,
admitted that the German answer haa
been sent to. the United States, but de
clined to state the terms, leaving them
for the Washington authorities to publish.
It was Intimated, however, that the an
swer was not favorable. The exchange of
views * between the ' various Interested
Cabinets has been completed and the mat
ter is now regarded as ' ended. The For

United States lays great weight upon the
proposition or will press the same.

LONDON, Jan. 12.â According to a dis

Captain Chou. who participated In the
Chuchou massacres, has been sentenced
to death.
SHANGHAI. Jan. 1Lâ The Mercury says
LI Hung Chang Is breaking down and his
death is imminent.
"I think that so far as Li Hung Chans
himself Is concerned he Is perfectly sin
cere in his position as mediator, but my
observation leads me to Judge that any
agreement the Chinese make now will be
kept by them no longer, than it suits their
convenience. The Empress Dowager will
by spring have a tremendous force of men
armed with modern rifles at her com
mand, and neither she nor Prince Tuan
has the slightest chance of falling Into
the hands of the allied forces. Next sum
mer will see the great struggle between
the well organized Boxers under the Em
press and Prince Tnan and the allied
forces in their attempt to seat the youns
Emperor firmly on the throne."
LI HUNG BREAKING DOWN.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Jan. 11.â Captain
P. C Lockhart. correspondent of the Lon
don Times In China, who accompanied
General Gaselee's relief force, left for
New York en route to London to-day.
Speaking of the situation In China he
said:
PREDICTS A GREAT CONFLICT.
Killed for a Few Dollars.
Body Is Found by
Visitor.
The officers who are investigating the
murder have small hope of locating the
murderer as he left nothing behind him
which could be used as a clew, and haa
had twelve hours In which to make his
escape. The murder for robbery theory
is the only one that the officers can ac
cept, as Brodersen was a peaceable old
man and had no enemies. Brodersen was
a native of Denmark and aged about 63
years. His only relative Is a niece livtus
In Oakland whose name is not known.
The kitchen door was found w-ide open,
and there was no evidence of a struggle.
From the nature of the wound in the dead
man's neck death must have followed Im
mediately. The murderer used a gun
loaded with birdshot. The shot scattered
over a surface covering six Inches, and
there were no powder marks, which would
have been the case had the assassin been
closer to his victim. A muzzle-loading
shotgun was found in Brodersen's house,
but It showed no Indications of having
been recently used.
At a distance, partially covered with
sand, was a 10-cent piece. Grasped in
the right hand of the corpse, which re
clined upon' its back, was a tin candle
stick with a half-burned candle In It.
The murder was evidently committed the
night before. The clothing was saturated
with water, showing that It had been out
during the rainfall which occurred all of
Thursday night. Brodersen was prob
ably returning from his barn when he was
shot down. His horse and wagon were
In their accustomed places in the barn,
a distance of perhaps 200 feet from the
house, so that the murder was commit
ted as he was about to go to the house.
Manuel Martin went to Brodersen's
ranch this morning to buy some eggs.
First knocking at the front door and re
ceiving no response he went around to the
rear. As soon as he got around the aide
of the house he came upon Brodersen's
body, lying stiff and wet, abo 'it thirty f set
distant from the kitchen <ioor. Martin
made a hurried examination of his horri
fying discovery and found a gaping gun
shot wound in the neck. The outer gar
ments of the body consisted of a heavy
woolen shirt and trousers. The four pock
ets of the trousers were turned inside out.
Brodersen drank alone, and all those
who saw him say that he was perfectly
sober.
The last seen of Brodersen alive was
yesterday afternoon, about 5 o'clock. At
that hour he was on his way home from
one cf his daily peddling trips amons the
farmers along the Alvarado road. Ha
had stopped for a few minutes at what la
called the Halfway House, where he bor
rowed J5 from the landlady. After nego
tiating the loan Brodersen spent some of
the money over the bar for two or three
drinks. Then he resumed his homeward
Journey In the rig familiar to the people
of the district who patronized him. The
fact that he borrowed the money indicates
that all Brodersen had on his person at
the time he was killed was what be had
left after buying the drinks.
OAKLAND. Jan. 11.â The body of "Jess"
Brodersen, an old rancher living near Al

WORK OF ROBBER BANDS.
Reign of Terror and Bloodshed in
Many Sections of China.
SEATTLE, Jan. 11.â A correspondent of
the Shanghai Mercury writes from New
chang that the province Is in the hands
of robber bands. On the railway line near
Shlnmintun, a Russian patrol of twenty
men was attacked and only two escaped
with their lives.
The Russians seem to be utterly Inca
pable of dealing with the robbers, who
elude every effort made to capture them.
In some Instances pitched battles have oc
curred, In which the robbers have won.
Even in the Russian settlement robbers
Have made their appearance and night
shots are frequently heard.
A military corps consisting of Chinese
has been formed by the Russians with the
object of dealing with the robbers. A rob
ber chief and his followers have been en
listed, reducing the case to the proposi
tion of setting a thief to catch a thief.
At Heungshan two thieves went into the
house of Lao Shongsam, during his ab
sence and murdered eight persons, as fol
lows: Wife, three sons, the oldest of
whom was six years; two daughters and
two servant girls.
Robber bands are terrorizing Canton, in
side and outside the city. On one occa
sion they made a daring attempt to rob a
shop in the Fifth Ward. Meeting with
resistance, they killed two shopkeepers.
At a village outside the city the rob
bers killed one man, wounded two badly
and set fire to a house.
Word has been received at Canton from
Yingtak, on the North River, that a mem
ber of the Wesleyan Mission had been
beaten to death while resisting robbers.

SANTO DOMINGO,' Jan. 11.â The Dom
inican Government has Issued a decree
against the collection of duties by the
San Domingo Improvement Company of
New York. There is intense excitement,
and tha anti-American feeling is strong.
The action Is due to the protest of the
Belgian bondholders. The duties will now
be collected' for treasury needs. A com

been appointed to supervise the financial

Congress is considering a demand of

power to meet the situation. Refugees
from Calvinia and Clanwilllam are flock-

that many poor whites are certain to Join
the Boers as are also many bitter Bund
men in the neighborhood of Clanwilllam
and Malmesburg, who openly declare that
they intend to Join the invaders.
According to latest reliable reports an
other party of 500 Boers has reached the
Doom River, seventy miles south of Cal

Hertzog's main body, 700 strong, with
two guns, has crossed the Roggeveld
Mountains and is now probably in the
neighborhood of Elandsdrift, forty miles
east of Clanwilllam. Hertzog's Intention,
apparently. Is to move toward Ceres and
Worchester. Only a few passes are pass
able for the guns and the whole country
Is difficult to traverse. The passes are
narrow and easily defended.

LONDON, Jan. 12, 4:50 a. m.â It Is un

securely all the railroad lines In South
Africa, having recovered possession of
the Delagoa Bay line which had been cut
January 7.
According to the Pretoria correspondent
of the Daily Mall Lord Kitchener is now
organizing a force of 30,000 irregular horse,
which will occupy some weeks. When
this force is ready he will resume offen

Meanwhile the invasion of Cape Colony
looks more threatening. The news that
Commandant Hertzog has two guns Is
rather startling, as It was formerly as
serted that the invaders had no guns.
The defenses of Cape Town, Including
two 4.2 naval guns, are now completed
and the recruiting of volunteers is active
throughout the colony.
According to dispatches to the Daily

MARSEILLES. Jan. 11.â The passengers
of the Russie arrived here by mall at 7:30
this evening. A great crowd was in wait
ing at the station to greet them. They
were loudly cheered as they left the train,
and inar.y touching scenes ensued when
the sufferers met their relatives. Lieuten
ant Gautberoit tells the following story
of the Russle's experiences:
"The steamer ran ashore at 11 o'clock
Monday morning. Only the watch was on
deck at the time. The passengers rushed
up undressed when the^y felt the shock.
and a panic ensued. The captain and of
ficers finally succeeded In calming the
people and the boats were prepared for
launching. It was found, however, that
the tea was too rough. As night came on
the KusEle began to sink. The afterhold
and the engine-room were Inundated, and
the vessel, which rolled badly, heeled to
the starboard. The passengers took refuge
in the first cabin and the smoking-room.
"Tuesday morning a \iolent wave burst
in the door of the saloon. The passengers,
who were again stricken with panic,
rushed on deck. We assured them and
then barricaded the doorway with mat
tresses. All day we were obliged help
lessly to watch attempts to reach us with
rockets and lifeboats from the shore and
by tugs.
A few minutes later the Carro boat left
the Russle's side heavily laden. As she
approached the shore the occupants were
f<-cn to be women and one baby. The en
t^uriasm was delirious. The spectators
P'.-jr.ged Into the sea. Some of them
dragged the lifeboat ashore and others
lifted the women out of the boat and car
ried them In their arms through the waves
to dry land. One woman was clasped in
the arms of her son. who had been wait
lr.g on shore since Monday. She owooned
and had to be transported on a stretcher,
hastily constructed from wreckage, and
covered with blankets, to the lighthouse.
The other women collapsed from fatigue,
cold and hunger. Their haggard faces
and trembling limbs told of the awful ex
periences they had gone through.
The heroism finally was rewarded, as,
with daybreak, the weather perceptlblv
moderated. The sÂ«a became calmer and
the wind, having shifted from east to
north, the Carro fishermen at about 6:39
a. ia. again put out to tea. The specta
tors watched with fast-beating hearts as
the beat disappeared amid the waves.
More than once it was thought she was
engulfed, but the small craft always rose
In eight again en the crest of the waves,
approaching nearer to the Russie.
Then a rope was thrown, -which the fish
ermen caught, and the lifeboat soon after
ward was alongside. Then, above the
hcwling wind, rose cries of joy from
those on board the Russie, which were re
echoed by the crowd ashore. Another
boat, manned by four men. was then
launched and succeeded In reaching tho

Becondâ There . was not only extravagance
but . downright dishonesty In many details of
the commission's work. What can be thought,
for Instance, of the raising of the salary of
Secretary Gasklll from $250 to $600 a month?
This may not be exactly stealing, but it has a
look very much like it. Perhaps it would be
better to call It exapproprlatlon ; or to em
ploy a euphemism Invented by Wilkle Collins,
"moral agriculture." Certainly- tho I^eglela-
Firstâ From the very Initial the commission
was used for the advancement of a cabal in
that body, who spent money recklessly and
without regard to the object for which the
commission was organized. Mr. Varney Gas
kill, the secretary of the commission, and a
man absolutely unfitted for his position through
lack of experience and downright incapacity,
was allowed to run matters at his own sweet
will, despite all tha efforts of Commissioner
Truman to curb him within proper limits, Com
missioner Foote standing In with him and
Commissioner Runyon not caring to Interfere.
From the detail of the shipment of exhibits to
their storing and final dispositionâ from Al
pha to Omegaâ the affairs of the commission
were blundered. . The Graphic is in possession
of Information too direct and reliable to ad
mit of any doubt on this point.
sion, but it soon became known that the
early start after business meant that the
committee had its eye on no one but
**oote, Runyon and Gaskill.
The matter of an investigation haa
grown out of charges that appeared in
the Western Graphic of Los Angeles,
dated January 5, Truman's paper, in
which an Inquiry is demanded and the
following allegations are made:
ture, if its members had had the slightest idea
that their money was to be made ducks and
drakes of In this manner, would not have
passed tho bill which entrusted so large a
sum to the distribution of the California com
mlBston. They would have drawn their purse
strings tight. But, admitting, for* the sake of
argument, that this was only extravagance
and low-down jobbery, the Western Graphic
has positive Information that fully 120,000 was
thrown away in unnecessary expenses, which
could be called nothing but dishonest outlays.
This Is a large sum, but we are assured that
It Is a minimum summary of tha real facts
Thirdâ The- Graphic is Informed and believes
that the atmosphere which surrounded the
headquarters of the California commission was
of a disgracefully Immoral kind. Orgies of a
peculiar and discreditable sort took place there.
The visitor waa liable to be shocked by tor
rents of raucous oaths and obscenities, and, at
least In one case, they might have witnessed
a physical assault of one commissioner upon
another.
A number of copies of thÂ© paper con
taining these charges were sent to the
Assembly in the care of Mellck and he
distributed them. Just when or how the
committee will approach the subject has
not -been decided, but it 'Will not carry

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 11.â From the attitude of
the Assembly Committee on Commissions
and Public Expenditures, it Iooks as if an
interesting tale of the doings of the Paris
Exposition Commlsslcn were to supply
one of the interesting stories of the ses
sion. The committee haa about deter
mined to investigate the expenditure of
the $130,000 set aside for the expenses of
the commission. It has been charged that
the energies of the commissioners were
directed more to the matter of spending
the appropriation than oi having: it do the
most good, and the Assembly committee
will take up the matter -If It can do so.
Whether or not It can Is still a matter
of doubt, for there axe seven members of
tha committee and lour of these are of
the Pendleton party. Presumably the
latter favor the Governor's appointees,
and the Paris Commission was appointed
by him. Melick and Bliss are willing to
go ahead with the inquiry, but neither of
them Is willing to take up the investiga
tion * with nothing but a whitewash Jn

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 11.â Both houses of
the Legislature adjourned at
noon to-day for a recess until
Monday morning. They would
have made it Monday afternoon,
but the constitution forbids a re
cess of more than three days, so it had
to be Monday morning or nothing. As
soon as the houses adjourned Senators
and Aesemblymen started for the trains,
and now the hotel lobbies are as deserted
as a weekday picnic, as all the leaders
have taken themselves to their homes.
The one topic of interest here this even
ing is the^resignatlon of Alden Anderson
of Solano from membership in and the
chairmanship of the Committee on Com
missions and Public Expenditures. This
morning he handed to Pendleton this writ
ing:
"I hereby resign as chairman and mem
ber of the Committee on Commissions and
Public Expenditures."
There had been talk of suoh an action,
but still it was unexpected. Before the
fact was generally known, however. An
derson had left the capital, and every one
was speculating to no purpose on the
meaning and intent of his action.
Just who will get the chairmanship of
the committee in Anderson's place is a
matter for further speculation. There are
now on the committee Hasson. Brady,'
Treadwell, Melick, Bliss and Irving. Has
pon is already chairman of the Commit
tee on Public Health and Quarantine,
Brady has Commerce and Navigation,
Treadwell has Revision and Reform of
Laws and Irving is a Democrat. This
leaves Melick and Bliss in lino for the
place, with the preference for Melick if it
were not for the possibility of the Paris
Commission investigation. That may im
pel the appointment of an outsider to the
committee and to tbe chair.
The Legislature "has been unusually
quick at organizing this session. Every
thing is ready for a start Monday, and
from then on sessions of the Assembly
and the Senate and meetings. of commit
tees will keep the Legislature busv. There
are a few bits of patronage still coming
bits made up of a remaining dollar from
one man's allowance or a half-dollar from
another's. Older members are Industrious
ly gathering these in, and before long
even the crumbs will bo gone.
This evening's train brought Adolph B.
Spreckels ;*id General A. W. Barrett, who
come to attend the meeting of the State
Board of Agriculture to-morrow morning.
The mfetlng is important from the fact
that a secretary to fill the vacancy caused
by the resignation of Peter J. Shields may
he elected. The members of the board
profess ignorance as to candidates
for the place, nor will they say that the
election Is certain to be held. The
board will discuss the bill introduced in
the Senate by Devlin anri in the Assem
bly by Johnson appropriating $100,000 for
improving the State Pair buildings and
grounds, and for selling some of the more
valuable property and purchasing other
property, less valuable, adjoining. This is
the only bill the society is interested in.

against the election of Senator Lardner,

An act providing for municipal street
improvements was introduced by 'Walker
of Santa Clara. It is intended to be used
instead of the Vrooman act by email
towns, its use being optional. A distlnc
i tive feature of it is that providing for

basis. Much preliminary work is elimi
nated. The bill was drafted by the Judi
ciary committee of the California League
of Municipalities and was approved In the

The appropriation bills introduced to
day aggregate more than a half million
dollars; in proposed direct expenditure.

Johnson fathers two bills involving, the
largest expenditures. One measure intro
duced by him, Assembly bill No. 144, calls
for JlOO.uOO, and another. No. 14S, for $150;
(1K). The lirst bill provides for the pur
chase from the board of directors of the
California State Agricultural Society of the
blocks in Sacramento bounded on the
north by B street, on the east by Twenty
second street, on the south by H street
and on the west by Twentieth street; and
also the west half of the blocks lying
immediately east of this tract. The pur
pose of the bill is to acquire title for the
State of the agricultural fair grounds.
Johnson's other measure contemplates
the joint investigation with the Federal
Government of the water resources of the
State and tho question of forest preser
vation. The bill provides for the appoint
ment by the Governor of a Board of
Water Commissioners of three members,
which shall have power .to appoint a sec
retary and to direct such topographical
purveys as the Federal departments shall
recommend, the State's expenditures for
these purposes not to exceed the expend
itures of the Federal Government.
State highways are important among
tlie appropriation bills. Greer of Sacra

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO. Jan. 11.â The Senate
added to its file by a score or
more of bills this morning and
then adjourned until Monday.
The most important bill intro
duced was by* Simpson, who sub
mitted a measure pjÂ«ulatlng the sa!e
of franchises and defining "gross
receipts." In thi3 Mil Simpson pro
vides that street railways, steam rail
ways, telegraph and telephone companies,
gas and water companies and all public
utilities shall pay to the State 2 per cent
of their gross receipts, after an interval
of live years from the commencement oÂ».
their operation, and in case of a renewat,
from the date of renewal. When a fran
chise is to be part of a road or line of
pipes or wires, the gross receipts are to
be taken as that part of tlie gros3 re
ceipts of the whole which is proportional
to the relation of tho s>ize of the new fran
chise to the whole svutem.
The most important leature of the bill,
however, is a provision allowing any re
sponsible bidder, after the sealed bi-Jn
have been 'opened, to raise the highest
bid not less than 10 per cent. Any ona
else may raise this second bid not lesd
than 10 per cent, and .such raises will be
allowed until there are no further raises.
Then the franchise snail go to the highest
bidder.
Leavltt submitted a bill repealing' th->
act which compels thÂ» admission to anv
place of public amusement of any one
who will pay the price of a ticket;. Thi*
bill is to enable race track associations tu
bar touts, discredited jockeys and book
makers and others equally objectionable.
There is a good deal. of latitude in the bill,
but it will be amende! in committee so as
to make certain the provisions regarding
the persons restricted. JLeavitt also in
troduced a bill making it a felony to pohÂ»
on animals, which includes the "doping"
of dogs and horses at coursing parks ami
race courses.
Luchsinger introduced a constitutional
amendment providing that a majority of
the votes cast for a charter may carry
the measure, and that three-fifths of tho
votes cast on the amendment may amend
a charter. As it is now, it requires in one
case a majority and In the other three
fifths of the votes cast at the election.
Senator Flint of San Benito, whose dis
trict was the beneficiary of Claus Spreck
els' loan to the State three years ago,
introduced a bill to repay to Mr. Spreckels
that portion of the $25,000 he advanced
which had been expended In succoring the
drought-stricken districts. This claim
amounts to $11,675 S2. The money was ad
vanced at the request of Governor BudO,
then executive, and the unexpended bal
ance of the $25,000 was returned to Mr.
Spreckels. During the last Legislature
a bill providing for tho repayment of the
expended balance was introduced. It
passed both houses of the Legislature
without a dissenting voice and without
amendment, but the Governor pocketed it
and killed it. This session it appears not
from Claus Spreckels, for he refused to
have further dealing 'n the matter when
the bill did not become a law. but from
the f/iends of the StaÂ»e University, air.
Spreckels has turned the claim over to
the university and if the bill goe3 througn
it will get the money. The same bill was
introduced in the Assembly by John of
San Luis Obispo.
Smith of Los Angeles was tho first to
come to the aid of the newspaper men.

Senator Luchsinger presented a resolu

SAN JOSE. Jan. 11.â That Eobprt 9to!K
who yesterday killed his daughter and
himself, contemplated murdering his en
tire family is evidenced by statements he
made to friends around the city. In the
last couple of weeks he has declared sev
eral times he would kill himself and his
family. Several weeks ago he attempted
to kill Mrs. Stolle because she refused to
give him some money. At that time he
fired a shot at her in the house, but
missed. Before he could use his revolver
again the woman rushed from the build
ing and remained away from home for
several days.
Mrs. Stolle, who waa prostrated by thÂ©
news of the tragedy yesterday, said to-day
in an interview that she haa been In con
stant fear lor the lives of herself and,
daughter for several weeks.
ot"f, nre .? t3 a^'nst our lives." said Mrs.
btolle. were of almost dally occurrence
* or some time my huaband had beeii
making frequent demands upon me for
money. He would ask for sums of }3) and
more, and insisted on having them under
penalty of shooting me and killing my
daughter. 1 granted these requests out
?l Â«fÂ£ J m aorry 1 did not ve bim
the $125 he demanded, for it might havd
saved my daughter's life. When my
daughter made to me and my friends the
confession of her father's guilt and he
learned that I had such knowledge he
threatened to kill us all and set the bouw
on tire.
Stolle tried to inveigle his wife back to
her home on Tuesday afternoon. It i3
believed he then had the tragedy planned
and meant to get her back to kill her. Ho
telephoned to Mrs. Stolle several times
and asked her to return to him. She re
fused to see him unless he gave up his
weapon to friends. He then proposed that
she come home and he would call in
friends and in her presence give them hia
revolver. Mrs. Stolle accused him of try-
Ing to deceive her and he became enraged
and told her over the phone that if Â«hÂ©
did not come home he would call at Mrs
Garvey's house and kill her.
Mrs. Stolle believes that her husband
held the Â£lr! a prisoner in the house all
Tuesday and Wednesday.
"During Tuesday afternoon and even-
Ing, said Mrs. Stolie to-day, "some of
my friends and I tried to telephone to
Bertha to beg her to escape if she possi
bly could from her father. Her father
was there, and when he knew we were
talking to her he suddenly cut off the
telephone communication. I have no doubt
that he then had all the doors locked and
that she was a prisoner awaiting his sen
tence of dÂ«ith, and escape for her was
Impossible."
The bodies of Stolle and his daughter
are still at the morgue, and will be buried
to-morrow afternoon. They have been
put Into plain but pood caskets and Ue
Fide by side. A wreath of smiiax and
lilies of the valley waa placed on the
breast of the dead girl.
The girl's life was insured for COO. This
policy was issued some months ago and
was payable to her mother.

TO STANFOBD STUDENTS
Says College Men Are, Subject to
Greater Temptations Than
Any Other Class.
STANFORD TTNIVERSITT, Jan. 11.â
John R. Mott. secretary of the World's
Student Christian Federation, addressed
the men of Stanford University to-night
in the Assembly Hall on "The Battle
Ground of Student Life." Dr. Jordan pre
sided and .introduced Mr. Mott. He said
that he had known Mr. Mott as a Cornell
man and had hopes of knowing bJm as a
Stanford man.
Mr. Mott said that college men were
subject to greater temptations than any
other class. The habits formed by a man
while in college made or marred his after
life.
It is a well-known fact that Mr. Mott
was offered a professorship at Stanford.
He also has been offered professorships at
other universities and has been sought
for even the presidency'in one of the large
Eastern universities, but he has declined
all these offers for the sake of his larger
work. Without doubt he wields a greater
Influence upon college students than any
man In the world to-day.
Certain changes and increases in the
Signal Corps furnished a text for the ob
structionists and they proceeded to make
the most of the opportunity. All efforts
and propositions looking to an agreement
to take a final vote on the bill this week
have failed and the army bill will prob
ably occupy the time of the Senate durlnt,
the greater part of next week. /
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â One of the
surprises of the day in the Senate was the
adoption of an amendment proposed by
Senator Daniel of Virginia, f-hich permits
the designation of officers of the volun
teer service with the rank of captain for
appointment to the regular army.
Under a previous deal between the Re
publican leaders in the Senate and certain
Democratic Senators, who were inclined to
oppose the bill on general principles, 'A
was agreed that officers of the volunteer
army might enter the regular army at the
rank of first and second lieutenants. That
concession was very gratifying to a num
ber of Democratic Senators and it was be
lieved that it was satisfactory all around.
Senator Daniel's amendment makes It
possible for officers of tne volunteer ser
vice to be admitted to the regular army
with the rank of captain. There waa Â»
somewhat feeble opposition to the Daniel's
amendment and it was adopted by the very
close vote of 24 to 22. Those who are ex
perts in detecting legislative Jugglery as
sert that the Daniel amendment was per
mitted to go Into the bill without serious
contention with an understanding among
the Republican leaders that It shall be
knocked out in conference.

Big Sales of Coffee.
At the annual meeting of the New York
Coffee Exchange President Taylor report
ed that the past year has shown a very
marked Improvement in the business
transacted upon the exchange. The total
recorded sales amounted to 7,442,250 bags,
or over 3,000,000 bags more than in the pre
vious year. This is the largest business
recorded since 1831. It is further reported
that a movement that meets with general
favor is the decision of the tooard of man
agers to abolish the present system of
separate sets of Rio and Santos standards
and to establish In their place single ex
change standards from numbers 1 to 9,
upon which all coffee deliverable upon the
exchange shall be graded. The first tea
call of the exchange will be held on Janu-
Foreign Trade of New York.
Altogether the story of the love match
Is lively in detail. The young people have
known each o.vfcex since childhood. Ser
geant Hooker is the son of Mrs. Bessie
Stewart Hooker and grandson of Senator
Stewart of Nevada. In 1S97, when the
Klondike gold fever started the marine
went to the Klondike, where he remained
for about a year. Disposing of his outfit
and claim to advantage he came back to
civilization just at the outbreak of the
SpaniEh-Axnerlcan war, and it wasn't long
before he succeeded, with his grandfath
er's influence, in getting an appointmept
in the Marine Corps.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1Lâ "The cards an
nouncing the engagement between Miss
Mary Condit Smith and myself are being
printed." said Richard Stewart Hooker, In
an interview. "We are to be married In
February," he continued. "I believe the
President and Secretary Long are to be
present. I would prefer a quieter wed
ding, I think, as I'm rather bashful. It
was my love of army and navy life that
led me to enlist in the marines."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â To-day a vig
orous attack was made upon that portion
of the army reqrganizatlon bill which
confers upon the 'President discretionary
power to Increase the strength of the
army to the maximum limit fixed by the
bill. Bacon began the attack and Platt
of Connecticut, replying maintained that
discretionary power ought to be conferred
upon the President, and expressed aston
ishment that anybody should entertain a
fear that the power ever would be abutted.
Bacon declared he would rather see his
party condemned to universal and never
ending banishment from political power
man to see such authority placed in the
hands of the President. An amendment
opening the way to the appointment
of volunteer officers to grades as high as
captain in the regular army was adopted.
Carter of Montana called up the bill
apportioning the Representatives of the
United States among the several States.
Without debate, it was passed precisely
as It came from tne House. It now goes
to the President for his signature.
Only seventeen Senators appeared on the
floor at the opening of to-day's session.
The prevailing epidemic of the grip and
the Inclement weather accounted for the
absence of many.
Carter, chairman of the Committee on
Census, reported favorably the bill passed
by the House making an apportionment
of Representatives in the House among
the States of the Union. The Senate com
mittee had made no amendments to the
bill as passed by uie House. In view of
the importance of the measure, Carter
asked for immediate consideration of it.
Hawley, fearing tnat its consideration
might interfere with the army reorgan
ization bill, was inclined to object, but
was prevailed upon to withhold his ob
jection. . .
At the conclusion of the reading of the
measure, Pettus of Alabama objected to
Its further consideration, and it went
over.
The resolution offered by Teller of Colo
rado providing for the printing of the Fil
ipino appeal, presented yesterday, was by
consent laid over until next Monday.
Consideration then was resumed of the
army reorganization bill. Hawley, chair
man of the Committee on Military Affairs,
withdrew the committee amendment to
section 31 of the new bill, providing for
the retirement of officers, on the active
list of the army.
Senator Teller also withdrew his amend
ment to that section. Hoar of Massachu
setts formally offered the amendment of
which he had heretofore given notice, pro
viding that no further military force shall
be used in the Philippines, except such as
may be necessary to keep order In places
in the peaceable occupation of the United
States, etc.
Carter moved that the amendment be
laid on the table. The motion prevailed,
32 to 19.
Pettlgrew's amendment providing that
one-third of the appointments to commis
sioned rank In the regular army should
be made from officers of the volunteer
armyâ the amendment which was under
discussion when the Senate adjourned last
eveningâ was defeated, 33 to 16. /
Bacon moved to strike out the provision
that the President in his discretion may
increase the number of corporals In any
troop of cavalry to eight and the number
of privates to seventy-six.
In- response to a question by Berry of
Arkansas Platt said he feared the pending
bill did not confer upon the President the
authority to increase the army from
68,000 to 100,000 at any time. That power,
he thought, ought to bo conferred upon
the President.
Hoar thought an army of 100.000 at pres
ent would not make the executive more
formidable than he was made by an army
of 25,000 when that limit was fixed. He
did not regard an army of 100,000 as a
menace, as that number, in his judgment,
was far within the limit ot domestlo
safety to liberty. The bill. In addition,
authorized the . President to reduce the
number of, the army still lower," but on
account of the use to be mado of the army
he. would have to vote against the bill.
The army bill was then laid aside and the
reapportlonment bill passed without ob
jection.
The Senate then at 4:55 p. m. went Into
executive session and soon adjourned.

CALL BUREAU. 1V.*S G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON*. Jan. 11.â The mem
bers of the California Congressional dele
gation to-day received telegrams from all
of the sugar* companies doing business in
California, asking them to make an ef
fort to have Secretary of the Treasury
Gape countermand r.is ruling of last
April. suspending thÂ« collection of coun
tervailing duties upon Russian sugar Im
ported Into this country. The California
eugar companies represented that the
Busper-slon cf countervailing duties has
hurt their business, a. great deal of Rus
clan Eucar comes into the United States,
r-early all cf It, however, comics: through
Germany.
Upon the receipt of the telegrams. Rep
resentatives Bargain, Needham, Waters,
Metcalf and Woods held a meeting and
decided to draw up a memorial to the
Secretary of the Treasury, to be Bigned
by all the members ol the California deie
eaticn. The memorial is ajj follows:
â¢â¢Hon. Lrvman J. Gage, Secretary of the
Treasuryâ Dear Sir: At tne earned re
quest of all the beet-sugar producers of
t.ie State cf California, we respectfully
urge that the ruling marie on April 20.
1Â»j, suspending the countervailing duties
on Russian eugar, be withdrawn, as the
Eame operates greatly to t;ie detriment of
sugar industries in said State. The com
panies affected by said rulii:g are the fol
lowing: The Spreckels Sugar Company,
the American Beet cugar Company, the
Alameda Sugar Company. *he L'nion Su
gar Company, the California and Hawai
ian Sugar Reftnlngr Company, and the Los
Alamos Sugar Company."
This memorial, a^ter having been signed
by <everv member of the delegation, was
presented to the SecrÂ«-tary of the Treas
ury this afternoon by Kepresentativea
Barnaul, Needham, Aleicalf. Waters and
Woods.
These gemiemcri presented the Califor
nia side cf the case to the Secretary, aud
he explained to them haw he came to is
sue his order. The Secretary said that if
any cour.;ry paid bounty upon goods ex
ported to the United fctates, he had a
right ur.dcr the law to discriminate
eg-air.st these goods. If no bounty Is paid
there can be no discrimination.
The Russian Government claims that it
pays no bounty, directly or indirectly, up
or. sugars. It is a fact, however, that the
IU:.-=siar. Government absolutely controls
The manufacture and sale of sugar in
Russia. It lixes the maximum price at
which sugar shall be cold in that country
a.nd provides that a reserve supply shall
ilnyi be kept on nand. In the event,
however, of overproduction, and if it be
comes necessary to Â«port the sugar to
other countries, the Government then
fixes an export duty to be paid upon such
exportation of sugar.
The result of all this is that the Govern
ment can say how mucn or how little su
par shall be sold, the price at which it
Fha'il be sold and everything appertaining
to the business.
So. while no dfrect bounty may be paid
by the Government, tbe sugar combina
tion collects what amounts to a bounty
by reason of the Government's setting
the price. The poir.t for the Secretary to
decide !s whether this constitutes a boun
ty. The matter has beÂ«?n discussed by the
Cabinet, and the propctition has also been
submitted to the Attorney-General for his
opinion. Mr. Gaire told the members of
the delegation that a conclusion would
rrobahly be reached In three or four days.
The decision of the Secretary of th*
Treasury. wh*>n mace, will be final, from
which no appeal can be made, and f^r
that reason he is givirg it careful con
eideratlon.

"We deny," he went on, "that Congress
has any right to impose any such tax up
on the trade between the States and Ter
ritories. Congress may regulate com
merce and may govern the territory, but
under the guise of governing that terri
tory may not govern the States of New
York or Pennsylvania.'- When It places a
tax upon the goods taken to Porto Rico
it is governing the State. The limitation
That the tax levied is a local tax was
denied, but it was denominated a tax for
local purposes.
Mr. Carlisle read the portions of the
Porto Rican act establishing the rates of
duty and disposition of the moneys col*
lected as a basis foP his complete argu
ment, and said the court would see that
on all goods from the United States to
Porto Rico there should be levied 15 per
cent of duties on foreign goods, with the
internal revenue of Porto Rico added, and
that goods from Porto Rico to the United
States enter upon the payment of 15 per
cent of customs, with Internal revenue
only added when the, goods are of Porto
Rican manufacture; while goods from
other countries paying the Porto Rico In
ternal revenue may come Into this coun
try without any internal revenue tax.
"We Insist," he added, "that this is not
the import duty. We object to the form
under which the Government seized our
goods and held them on their arrival at
Porto Rico until we paid them tribute in
the form of a tax."
An import Is something, he said, coming
from a foreign countrv. Porto Rico can
not be a foreign country, for Its courts
'send appeals to this body. This is, there
fore, not an import tax. but an export tax
upon goods sent out of these States, and
there are two specifications against sucn
export duties. . Opinions of the court wero
read to show that the tribunal had held
that no duty might be paid from one
State to another, as to a foreign country.
Argument was made that the tax was an
export tax and as such in direct violation
of the constitution of the United States
This tax, Mr. Carlisle said, which under
this law is Just as general as a tariff law,
is said to be a local tax. It is collected
everywhere, In every State and Territory
How can It be called local? Is the fact
that the proceeds of this tax are to be
used' for certain purposes of that conse
quence that the tax is laid first and ap
propriated afterward proof that this
is a local tax? More than half the gen
eral duties are, he said, collected at New
York, yet It Is not a local tax. but a tax
the proceeds of which may be used every
where.
Mr. Carlisle undertook to show that
both direct and indirect taxes had been
laid upon States and Territories alike, and
duties had been laid upon Imports into
Territories as well as States. Under the
contention of the Government that Terri
tories were not part of the United States
it might be taken that goods could go
free from Porto Rico to Alaska; but this
was not the case, for the same duties are
charged on goods from a Territory going
to Porto Rico as from a State.
On the point that the Territories were
not a part of the United States, Mr. Car
lisle read a history of the framing of the
constitution, showing that first it was the
Intention that "all acts and treaties"
should be the supreme law of the land.
This was before the word "constitution"
had been introduced, and he took it to
mean that it was the intention to have
the constitution apply to all parts of the
country, whether in the States or simply
in territory belonging to them.
Mr. Carlisle nryued that the constitution
must be interpreted as a whole and must
enable the Government to accomplish all
the purposes for which it- was framed.
It must be considered as an entirety, to
which all the agents of the Government
must look for power. International law,
he said, could not govern any agent of
this Government, but the court could look
to It for defining what the constitution
means. There would be two constitu
tions, he said, in the interpretation of the
counsel on the other side, one -for the
States and defining the powers and caring
for the rights of citizens, and the other
for the Territories. Riving no rights. Upon
the constitution there has been construct
ed a comprehensive system of laws gov
erning all the States and Territories, and
from the first Congress has made uniform
laws for tram's between States and Ter
ritories, as well as extradition, bank
ruptcy and naturalization laws. On the
latter point he paid that in the interpreta
tion of the Government there were sitting
courts outside the United States in a Ter
ritory granting citizenship in the United
States to a resident upon five years' in
habitation of a Territory outside the
United States.
Justice "White asked if the President
might acquire territory without the
consent of the treaty-making power, but
Mr. Carlisle said he was arguing that
peace obtained after the signing of the
protocol, that there was then no war,
and that the President could only create
a de facto government and have it gov
erned. While the constitution imposed
the duty upon Congress of regulating
commerce, yet since the signing of the
peace protocol the President, he said, has
exercised the powers of assessing duties
and carrying out all the duties of Con
gress. Mr. Carlisle said, the real ques
tion was not whether the constitution ex
tended to the inhabitants of Porto Rico,
but whether it extends over the Con
gress, the President and the Cabinet. The
contention is that the constitution pro
tects every person in the land in his per
sonal and property rights of the citizen.
When a Government takes from one man
more than it should, It is not taxation, but
it is taking his property without due pro
cess of law and giving him no compen
sation for It- .
Mr. Carlisle lirst took up the conditions
which led to the taking of the island and
read from proclamations of Generals Miles
and Wilson to show that the occupation
was meant to be permanent. The cession
of the island by Spain, he said, was com
plete and had been acknowledged by all
nations.
Hon. John G. Carlisle, chief attorney for
the plaintiffs, followed . Mr. Griggs. He
began by. saying that he would not discuss
questions ot policy, as they belonged to
another forum. The questions were to be
settled only on the constitution. He said
he had been as yet unable to form an
opinion as to the exact contention of the
Government. First, however, he believed
the contention was that the island of
Port6 Rico did not become a part of the
United States either on the signing of the
protocol or the ratification of the treaty of
Paris; that there was a condition existing
which placed the islands under the gen
eral protection and jurisdiction of the
United States, subject to certain limita
tions: that during a period between the
acquisition of the Territory and the pas
sage of laws by Congress the island might
be governed by the President, subject to
the laws of war, and that the island did
not become a part of the United States
until admitted by Congress, and until such
time as Congress may legislate for the
islands. From this it is argued, he said,
that, the islands not being a part of the
United States, Congress has a right to say
what taxes may be levied and collected. â
The Attorney General concluded by in
sisting that no private right would be con
served, but that the rights of the Govern
ment would be hampered, by the success
of the contention of the plaintiffs.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â Attorney Gen
eral Grlg-gs resumed his argument before
the United States Supreme Court to-day,
continuing his statement of the position
of the Government as to. the rule of uni
formity In tariff and internal revenue
taxes. He insisted that the application
of the internal revenue laws to Porto Rico
would be unwise and in many places un
profitable. A rule of uniformity In Inter
nal revenue taxes, he said, could be estab
lished when to be applied to contiguous
SStates, as the States were governed by
similar laws and similar conditions. But
when it came to applying these taxes to
widely separated territories inhabited by
polyglot races, a wide discretion was nec
essary and to endeavor to apply a system
of Internal taxes would be rather apply
ing a straitjaefcet than a constitution.
So, he said, the correct rule required ua
to consider the uniformity of the States,
but diversity was the necessary rule as to
Territories because of diversity as to
geography and racial characteristics ob
servable in the Territories.-

Why a Cold Kills
At this season of the year coughs and
colds are prevalent because of a lowered
vitality. The cold does not yield and too
often pneumonia aupervenes. "Eventhen," i
says a high authority on this disease, " pneu*
monia does not ordinarily prove fatal except
in tne case of very old or very young people.
The danger arises when it is complicated by
. heart or Kfdney disease." This is the secret
â¢ of the ravages of pneumonia. If the body ba
strong and the blood pure an ordinary cold is
immediately thrown off, but when the bodily
vigor is weakened by excessive worh, worry T
or grief and the blood is vitiated by acid /,
(which the kidneys ought to and will remove
when healthy, 'the'dread pneumonia too often *
claims its victim. If the blood be kept pure

At the annual meeting of the California

were elected for the coming year: S. S.

August R, F. Branded, Eugene Flanders
and N. L. Mead, members of the regatta
committee.
At the Eame meeting the California
Yacht Club decided to withdraw from the
Pacific Inter-dub Yacht Association, as
the club takes little ?art in public regat
ta*, and is unwilling to pay the assess
ments for the annual races. Early in 1900
the club seriously considered the question
of leaving the association, but was per
suaded to stay in it on the understanding
that it would not be called on for mora
than {10. When It was found necessarv
to levy an assessment -of $30. the club de
cided to withdraw. As the Kncinal Yacht
Club will probably do, the same, the days
of the association appear to be numbered.

Track Notes.
THE continued success of the rainy
season Is no doubt working won
ders with the bean and pumpkin
crops in the upcountry districts,
but it is creating consternation
among the form players at Oakland track.
After his decisive victory over The Fret
ter and Lennep only the day before Billy
Cahlll's colt Rolling Boer, with 8S pounds
up, looked "In," and 'was plunged on to
win the mile run yesterday, this time
with Ordnung and Lennep to down. Not
much was thought of Fred Foster's mare,
but - Ordnung commanded considerable
backing at odds of 2% and 3 to 1. Un
fortunately for Rolling Boer he was shut
off right after the start and had to take
the mud for nearly half a mile. Then
"Jack" Martin got the colt in front and
all looked pleasant. In the stretch Martin
became scared and starting to make his
run too soon was nabbed and beaten out
a length by Buchanan on Ordnung In the
very fast time of 1M2U.
This is but one tale of woe due to the
muddy condition of the track, for four
other choices were defeated. The climatic
conditions did not dampen the ardor of
racegoers one whit, for the attendance
was again large.
Highly touted as the real thing in the
mud, Maggie Davis, carrying 105 pounds,
closed an even-money chance for the first
event, a sprint over the Futurity course.
Fortunately for the books Buchanan
brought the mare in second, thÂ© purse
going to Isallne, a 4 to 1 chance, ridden
by Mounce. Old Monrovia nosed Ting-a-
Llng out for the show.
Through his ability to beat the barrier
Henry Shields had the mount on J. V.
Kirby* In the two-year-old spin at three
furlongs. Shields did all that was asked
of him, for outbreaking the bunch two
lengths his mount won down at the wire
by a nose from the favorite, Sol Uchten
steln. ThÂ« start waa a poor, one, Mike
Murphy and Dr. ScharfC being left at the
post. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
On "Wednesday Flatterer, with J. Daly
up, ran unplaced In a six furlong sprint,
won by Rollick. Yesterday this nama
brown colt had Mounce in the saddle, and
heavily played at 3 to 2. had things his
own way In the selling event for three
year-olds at six furlong*. Aa It so hap
pens quite often of late, O'Connor on Ada
N, the 8 to 5 second choice, put up a
sloppy ride, and her stable folks might
better have clung, to F. Kelley. QulÂ» II
ran in improved form, taking third place.
Horses, like climate, seem to change
from one week to another. Not so very
long ago Owensboro found It difficult to
navigate through some sloppy going, yet
In the fifth number ran like a confirmed
mudlark. His odds were once as good as
6%' to 1. ' â¢ Domlnlck had the Hildreth
horse In front alter a Quarter had been
covered: winning under restraint. Gal
anthus found It easy work taking second
place from Donator. "
With Morlnel the favorite. Lou Rey
went out In the closing mile and a fur
long run, and was never headed. Getting
away none too well from the- post, O'Con
nor came fast at the end with Opponent,
losing out by a neck only. The first choice
ran an Indifferent third.

HOUSE PASSES MANY
PRIVATE PENSION BILLS
Most Important Is That Relating to
General Bice, a Civil War
Veteran.
VTASH1XGTOX. Jan. 11.â Not since the
Fifty-first Congress nas the House passed
as many private pension bills at a single
sitting as it did to-dav. In all 170 special
pension bills were P3ssed to-day. The
most important one was to increase the
pension of General A. V. Rice from JJ5
to J100. General RicÂ» was wounded sev
eral times during the civil war and lost
a leg at Vicksburg. He was formerly a
member of Congress from Ohio and was
the author of the arrearages of pensions
act. The Senate had j-assed a bill to in
crease his pension to $60 and the House
raised the amount to 5100.

Committee on Public Lands to-dav favor
ably reported a bill to perfect title in cer
tain Chippewa scrip land locatfd Inside
the city of Salt Lake. This scrip land was
located and patented years ago and subse
quently laid out In town lots, sold and
built upon. The Supreme Court held that
the scrip had been improperly located and
was void. As many innocent purchasers

While nothing definite regarding the

CINCINNATI. Jan. 11.'â The directors of
the Saengerfest Athletic Association of
Cincinnati . express the, fullest determina
tion to-night that the Jeffries-Ruhlln fight
will be pulled off here February 15, but
the preponderance of public sentiment Is
to the contrary. â¢
The ministers held an enthusiastic meet
ing to-day and the women's clubs , and
other organizations opposing the flgnts
were unusually active, but the contest is
now between Mayor Fleischmann and the
Saengcrfest Athletic Association. After
repeated conferences with their attorneys
these two elements finally met. To-night
the directors gave out the following:
"The members of the Saengerfest
Athletic Association Company to-day re
quested of Mayor Fleischmann the imme
diate issuance of a permit. The Mayor
declined to Issue the permit now, but re
affirmed his promise and assured the
committee that he would issue the permit
two days before the date of the proposed
contest. The directors yet hold that the
contest can and will take place in Cin
cinnati on February 15."
Since Mayor Fleischmann , has been le
gally advised that the fight for the cham
pionship of the ' world does not come
within the Ohio statutes for sparring ex
hibitions under the auspices of a bona
ride athletic club. It Is understood that it
is the only kind of permit that he would
give two days in advance, and would como
ur.der the Ohio law: letting, the directors
take the chances in proceeding under that
permit.
In addition to the conferences to-day
between counsel there was an informal
meeting of the members of the bar and an
opinion was sent to Mayor Fleischmann,
signed by twelve leading attorneys, in
cluding Judge Judson Harmon, who was
Attorney General under the Cleveland
administration, and other ex-Judges, not
ably John \V. Warrington. This opinion
holds that for the past twelve years the
laws of Ohio have been severe against
prizefighting, the only exception being for
f--parrin.tr exhibitions under the auspices of
a bona fide athletic club. The attorneys
hold that a contest for the championship
of the\ world would not be held by any
court to be a sparring exhibition, and it
further points out that the Saengerfest
Athletic Club was incorporated after the
articles of agreement were signed by Jeff
ries and Ruhlin.
Notwithstanding all the objections
which confront them, the directors of the
Saengerfest Athletic Club to-nlpht insist
that they will have the tight and work iÂ»
still progressing at Saengcrfest Hall.
The remodeling will be completed next
week. The directors have made no over
tures to Manager Brady for relief and E.
G. Cook, who is representing Brady here,
is proceeding with his arrangements.
The directors and their friends insist to
night that there is an understanding
about the permit not being issued until a
day or two before P'ebruary 15, so as to
avoid interference or other obstructions.
In the contract of the Saensrerfest Club
*vlth the contestants, which includes $5000
forfeit, the club Is not held responsible if
the fight is prevented by the Governor or
Mayor, and there is much gossip about
these conditions having their influence at
this time.
NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â Gus Ruhlin con
cluded his training in the East to-day and
will leave to-morrow for Cincinnati,
where he will bejrln final preparations for
his fight with Jeffries, which Is scheduled
for February 15.
The attorneys of the Evangelical Asso
ciation of this city have a warrant for
the arrest of Gus Ruhlin. who has an en
gagement to appear at the Irwln matinee
here next Saturday and at the perform
ances during the week while he in train
ing here. The Ohio statute makes it a
felony to be in training in this State for a
prizefight, and under this section the op
ponents of the fight propose to begin with
the prosecution of Ruhlin, even to the ex
tent of taking his case before the Grand
Jury, which is now In session.

DENVER, Jan. ll.-Rufe Turner of

of Chicago in the fourth round of what
was to have been a i<m-round go before
the Colorado Athletic Association hero

style and frequently clinched. He waT-Â»
tumbled over In the first round Jt>y a sharp
right uppercut into which he ducked after
missing a left jab to the bodr.
Turner did not try to land except when
Otto would rush at him until the third
round, when he assumed the aggresslva.
SielofT immediately resorted to cHnchir.s
and in the fourth Turner returned to hl-s
former plan of waiting ior a chance. Af
ter a sharp mix-ur> Otto started to duck
away and Rufe landed a right half swing
with full force on Otro's law.
The latter's head seemed to strike tho
floor before any other portion of his body
and the noise of the contact was plains
heard throughout the house.
He was counted out and was unable to
leave the ring for five minutes after tho
end of the light. Turner was almost a-j

Inspired by Borne member who had an In
adequate Idea of the legislative amenities,
though doubtless tt was Inadvertent on
IT is suggested that the German Kaiser is influencing
the allies in China against the American policy ot
justice in dealing with that empire.
His original policy Â£01 setting up shambles in China,
and imitating Alaric, Attila, Genghiz Khan and Tam
erlane, having been defeated by the United States, he
is now believed to desire reprisals against us and is
i' sing for that purpose the quite general condition of
European jealousy of our trade supremacy.
As far as the American people are concerned, they
want their Government to stand, as it has from thi
beginning, for justice and right in China.
They recognize the ill effects of. the bloody policy of
Von Waldersee, who, under the pretense of hunting for
Boxers, has sent out punitive expeditions, which are
nothing less than slaughtering raids, in which men.
v.omen and children, innocent and guilty alike, are
crushed under the iron heel of his troopers.
If the Kaiser can influence Europe to enact inhuman
tragedies in China, let the responsibility be upon those
nations which gorge themselves with blood. The
United States may be powerless to prevent it, but our
hands will be kept clean.
The latest phase of the diplomatic tangle furnishes
room for believing that the United States may be
supported by Russia, and that if we withdraw from
the concert both will be out. Such action might, be
beneficial, as the rest of Europe would think twice
before plunging headlong against the protest of this
country and Russia.
The reasonable world is getting tired of the con
troversy and desires that it be settled. Responsibility
for the delay is constantly put upon China, but in
great part belongs to the other Governments, which
*re so watchful and suspicious of each other that they
delay decisions and make acute changes in their view
01 policy.
Meantime Chinese trade is suspended and commer
cial interests everywhere axe being sacrificed to Euro
pean politics.
One unaccountable feature in the present stage is
the hostile attitude of Austria toward the United
States. It was supposed that the incident of mutual
vithdrawal of diplomatic intercourse between the two
Governments which occurred some years ago had
passed, leaving no asperity of feeling. There have
been some minor troubles which do not justify the
her.t that seems to be shown at Vienna. This country
has received as immigrants a great many subjects of
Austria. One class of these, from old Bohemia, has
been out of favor at Vienna for a long time. But in
this country they Americanized and have furnished in
Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas and Nebraska many citizens
of prominence. Among them is Mr. Edward Rose
water of the Omaha Bee and Mr. Jonas of Wiscon
sin. President Cleveland sent Jonas as Consul to
Prague, his native city, and the Austrian Government
refused his exequatur and there was some rasping cor
respondence about it, ending in Jonas being accepted.
These incidents, however, do not furnish adequate
provocation for the reported Yankee-phobia which
seems to possess the Austrian court, and that feeling
must be referred to Berlin influence.

the advantage of being instructive as well as enter
taining. They go far toward demonstrating that ap
propriation bills for internal improvements are in the
nature of a national grab game, and that Congress
men who are most concerned in it are not so much
national statesmen as the mere representatives of con
stituencies.
In the debate on last Thursday, for example, Cush
man of Washington displayed before the House a
large chart containing figures of a size that
could be read easily by members in the re
motest part of the hall. On the chart were
displayed the names of the States having rep
resentatives on the River and Harbor Com
mittee, together with the amounts of appropriations
proposed for each. The figures showed that for those
States the bill carries direct appropriations of
$14,238,260, and authorized expenditures of $24,457,889.
For the remaining States the bill carries appropria
tions direct and authorized to the amount of $38,349.
000. Thus the members of the committee assigned
to their States about as much as they conceded to
all the rest of the Union, and there are ten States and
Territories that receive no appropriations whatever.
As for Washington, Mr. Cushman complained "it
has been overlooked like a white chip on a faro table."
He went on to say he .represents a city that has a
tonnage of 6,000,000, and it had been put off "with the
measly sum of $30,000." Then he shouted, "If you
think my vote can be bought at that price you are
off your base." Warming to his home theme he
added: "Imperial Caesar divided Gaul into three
parts, but he was an ancient and a provincial; had
he lived to the dawn of the twentieth century he would
have divided 'gall' into parts enough to give one to
each member of the River and Harbor Committee."
Perhaps the best contribution to the debate was
that of Hepburn of Iowa. That statesman attacked
the committee for granting such large appropriations
to the big cities of the Atlantic coast, and said the ap
propriations were made merely because "some freak
ship-builder saw fit to build an abnormal ship." He
declared: "Because a Scotch ship-building firm was
building a 6hip to draw thirty-four feet the last river
and harbor bill decided to increase the channel in New
York harbor to forty feet; now this bill proposed to
deepen the channel at the Boston harbor. Next yea*-
Philadelphia would demand deeper water; then Bal
timore, Charleston and New Orleans." In conclusion,
lie argued that ship-builders could be compelled to
conform the draught of their ships to the depth of the
water in the harbors they were to enter and not com
pel Governments to adapt the harbors to the draught
of the ships.
The idea that ships should be made to fit harbors
instead of making the harbors to fit the ships, is onfe
of those inland views of maritime problems that can
be best pictured in a comic paper. It has, however,
some basis of reason, for there must eventually be
some adaptation of the ship to the natural configura
tion of the world. We cannot remake the earth to suit
the ship-building trade.
Finally it was disclosed in the debate that one of
the members of the committee, Bishop of Michigan,
has in his district six counties fronting on the lake,
and he had put into the bill a harbor appropriation for
every one of them; while a member from Florida
on the committee had managed to obtain an appro
priation for a harbor that is not to be found on the
latest maps.
Such are the things a Representative has to meet
ir seeking to promote internal improvements in his
State. It it any wonder that men of long experiencl
are needed in Congress?. Is it strange that member
ship on the River and Harbor Committee is regarded
as a "pudding" in which none but old members are
entitled to share?
STATE PRESS COMMENTS
ANENT THE LEGISLATURE
THE METRIC SYSTEM.
WITH this Congress an earnest effort is to be
made to bring about the establishment in this
country of the metric system of weights and
measures. It is indeed time that something were
done in that direction. The Russian Government has
decided to establish it throughout the Czar's do
minions, and when it goes into effect there ourselves
and the British will be the only civilized people on*
earth who do not use it.
That there is a commercial advantage to be gained
by adopting it has long since been pointed out not
only by our Consuls but by British authorities who
have made a study of foreign markets. The machinery
made and used throughout Continental Europe is
gauged and constructed according to the metric sys
tem. The workmen Â«re familiar with the measure
ments of that system, while they do not know the
measures of America and Great Britain, and con
sequently if other things are all equal the articles that
conform to the metric system are preferred in the
market.
Some time ago it was reported from Germany that
the Iron and Steel Manufacturers' Union of- that
country had adopted a uniform system of metric di
mensions for all articles of universal consumption,
and it was announced at the time that the reason for
the step was that competition between great manu
facturing nations has now become so keen that every
point of advantage is a matter of importance, and
experience has shown that in dealing with people
who use the metric system there is a big advantage in
usinjj the same measurements. â¢
The market in which the metric system is used is
very large. It is estimated that two-thirds of the peo
ple living in civilized countries use that system, and
the number is increasing, for it is to be noted the
metric system is growing in favor in all parts of the
world. When it has been established in Russia there
will be another vast market using such measurements
It is clear, therefore, that if exporters of America and
Great Britain wish to compete on even terms with
their rivals they will have to follow the example of
the majority.
Of course it is not expected that the system could
be put into operation at once. The bill now in the
hands of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights
and Measures provides only for the use of the met
ric system in all transactions by and with the Gov
ernment after a fixed date. The operation of such
a law would compel the people to acquaint themselves
with the system and would thus; prepare the way for
the adoption of such measurements in private busi
ness.
It is probable the change in our weights and meas
ures could be effected with much less difficulty thin
appears at first thought. The terms, "Metres, grams,
kilos," etc., appear strange to us,,but we are a people
who easily adopt new words, and the . calculations
would be no trouble to us at all, for these are based
upon the decimal system with which our coinage has
made us thoroughly familiar. The greatest trouble
would be in getting our scales and measuring instru
ments changed and in applying ; the metric system to
our subdivisions of land, but even in those respects
the reform could doubtless be worked out without
entailing any great amount of confusion.
It is to be noted that the British are working for
the new system even more eagerly than ourselves.
Not long ago the Associated Chambers of Commerce
of Great Britain adopted resolutions declaring that
whereas the present system of British weights and
measures is "in the opinion of her Majesty's Cpnsuls
responsible for great injury to British trade, this as
sociation urges her Majesty's Government to intro
duce into and carry through Parliament as speedily
as possible a bill providing that the use of the metric
system of weights and measures shall be compulsory
within two years of the passage of the bill, and sug
gests that meanwhile the system should be adopted
ir. all specifications for Government : contracts."-
Since Russia has already acted and Great Britain is
preparing to act, it is surely time for the United States
to give the subject serious consideration. We rauat
keep up with the procession.
THE horoscope of the twentieth
century has been cast for the Bos
ton POst by a noted astrologer,
known in astrological literature
as "Hermes." .
Mercury stands In the tenth house of the
Zodiac, and Mars" In the seventh house,
both in angles. Mercury rules the desti
nies of the United States, and its dom
inant position over Mars shows that the
United States will rule the whole of North
and South America, but not without fight
ing with Germany and England, for Mars,
the ruler of those countries, stands in the
house of open enemies. Uranus, the ruler
of Russia, however, stands In the,power
ful ruling tenth house, and near to Mer
cury, showing a possible coalition between
Russia and the United States.
Uranus and Saturn, rulers of the rising
sign, portend universal changes In politi
cal and intellectual circles, and point to a
growth of \sociallsm.
The spread of education, commerce,
aerial and submarine navigation, increase
of mechanical Invention, are all Indicated
by Mercury strongly placed In the tenth
house elevated above all other planets.
Celibacy will increase, as is indicated
by. the conjunction of Venus with tha
moon In Mars' second house of Scorpio.
"Wars and rumors of wars and business
disasters are shown; the first by the po
sition of the sun in the house of con
gresses near to Saturn, and the second by
the position of a retrograde Neptune In
the house of speculation. Speculation In
general will be very active In the opening
years of the new century.
The outlook on the whole Is optimistic
and rose-colored, Sagktarlua rules the
eleventh house, the- house of hopes, am
bitions and of congresses, parliaments,
etc. Jupiter, Its ruler, applying to a con-
Junction of the sun, and the moon In con
junction with Venus In the ninth, are both
grand testimonies of an optimistic world
outlook for the twentieth century.
Governments will yield popular meas
ures to the people; religious creeds will
near a better point of common under
standing, and bigotry will decline.

THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
BY way of New Year greetings the Merchants'
Association Review presents to the people in
the January number an earnest plea for united
action in all movements tending to the advancement
of the city. It very justly says: "Mere location in the
highway of commerce will not of itself create 1
metropolis. Climate end soil will not determine the
result. Many of the worst failures in cities are the
world's ideal spot*; some of the most success
ful communities are almost barren of natural re
sources. That city carries off the palm whose citizens
seize the opportunity." '%'-}'
The Merchants' Association can with good grace
make this plea for unity and for action, since it has
itself practiced what it preaches and set the example
it desires others to follow. The Review states that
there are at present 2500 legitimate business houses in
San Francisco, and over half > of the number, have al
ready enrolled as members of the association. That
in itself is a record to be proud of. It is questionable
whether any other large city in the Union has an insti
tution devoted to the service of the public which has
been able to draw to its' membership so large a pro
portion of the business population..
The success which has attended the association is
due to what it has done for the public more than to
what it has done for its members. It is because it has
proven itself useful to the whole community that the
business men of the city have in such large numbers
united themselves with it, and that fact is creditable
alike to the organization as a whole and to the indi
viduals who compose it.
The success attained in the past gives promise of
greater successes to come. More than half the busi
ness houses of the city are now allied with the asso
ciation. Why should not all be allied with it?
The conditions of the commercial world at this time
render it important that San Francisco exert the full
force of all her enterprising men at this juncture.
The rapidity with which Pacinc Ocean trade is de
veloping and shaping its course makes this a critical
period in the history of the city. . As has been said by
the Review: "As certain as the earth's revolution, one
of the world's greatest cities will exist on the Pacific
Coast. Whether it will be on Puget Sound, or in
Oregon, or in Central or Southern California, will
depend upon the comparative capacity of the people
of Seattle, or Portland, Los Angeles or San Francisco
to win the prize."
Here, then, are a great issue and a golden oppor
tunity. We cannot meet the one with assurance of
victory nor fully profit by the other unless there be
unity of action among our citizens. The men who
have upheld the Merchants' Association in the past
should support it now with increased ardor, and those
who have hitherto held. aloof should now unite with
it and make up for former apathy by zeal in the
future.

marked by the heaviest influx of immi
grants since 1S92. The Hebrew immigra
tion is one-eighth of the total, and the
greater percentage of this class were Rus

dinavian immigration has fallen off re
markably. Under the system that now

EZJOREIGN ship-owning interests are working
1 hard to postpone, paralyze or in any way defeat
*â¢ the bill to secure an American merchant marine.
Their stake is the largest held by any interest that
can be affected by Congressional legislation. Last
year we paid in freight to these foreign ship-owners
$160,000,000. That vast sum went abroad from this
country to pay the profits of foreign owners and ship
builders and the wages of foreign workmen. If by
some compulsion this country had been, laid under
tribute to Europe and compelled to pay that amount
in one year our people would be up in arms and ready
for war to end the drain forced under duress.
The interest on that sum at 5 per cent is $8,000,000
a year. The shipping bill proposes to assist American
ships by the payment of $9,000,000, or only $1,000,000
more than the interest on the money we pay to Europe
for transporting our merchandise to its market.
In fact, then, it is proposed to help shipping to the
extent of only one million a year, since keeping the
year's sum at home which we now pay to Europe adds
its increment to the national wealth..'
Great interests centered in New York and influenced
by the foreign shipping combine are on record to the
effect that "American cargoes under the American
flag" is a mere sentiment. It is a pretty good Ameri
can sentiment that will keep $160,000,000 a year at
home as profit to American ship-owners and wages to
American ship-builders instead of sending it abroad.
We are perfectly aware that no prejudice will be left
unappealed to by this foreign influence to defeat the
bill. Already Senator Hanna is being roundly abused
for advocating it, and even Republicans are whispered
into frantic declarations that he will ruin the party
by it.
If the party can be knlled by legislation that stop*
a foreign drain of $160,000,000 a year by spending
only $1,000,000 in excess of its interest, let its epitaph
be, "Blessed are' the dead that die in the Lord," for
no party ever laid down its life in a better cause.
We would like objectors to tell us why we need
a navy if we are to have no merchant marine? Do
not Americans see that the foreign argument against
merchant ships, if it prevail, supplies a home argu
ment against a navy, so that we are simply being used
aÂ« tools by foreign Governments which fear our naval
supremacy and wish to avert it?
Last year American ships were paid only $15,000,000
for American freights, and it may well be asked why
we need a navy costing $200,000,000 to convoy and
stand ready to defend such a trifling American inter
est as that $15,000,000 represents.
This subject was thrashed over in the campaign
and every possible appeal was made to prejudice
against it. Can any one say that these appeals were
rcflected'in the vote?
The people want American money paid for freight
ing our goods in our own ships, because they want to
restore our merchant marine by the work of American
ship-builders.
It is time that the foreign influences at work against
our people should be uncovered and made to fight in
the open.

"M Quad" has also had his fun â¢with
the American German in the "Carl Thin
der" series, and with the various absurdi
ties of wild Western Journalism in . thÂ©
"Arizona Kicker." There are few comic
fields that he has not at some time en
tered. His has teen the almost Impossible
task described so vividly by Lamb of fur
nishing weekly and almost dally columns
of facetious matter to the evanescent
pages of the press. Few have better stood
the test, yet after all surh matprlal is not
literature, nor is it humor. The field cov
ered by "M Quad" and hla school Is that
of broad farce. They supply the place
which the court Jester held in ancient
days and which the circus clown filled in
more modern days.
. Of much the same character as thÂ©
writings of Lewis are those of scores of
literary comedians who during the period
since the war have risen from obscurity to
a place of wld<Â» recognition, many of them
to drop as quickly Into obscurity. Robert
J. Burdette. the funny man of tha Bur
lington Hawkeye. combines broad farca
with a view of Mriousness and true poetio
feeling. Matt Jturbnnk. with his epigram

lately was to be found in every comic
.lournal nnd. latest of all. John Kendrick
Bangs, the architect of the unlauÂ©
"Houseboat on the Styx." are but thÂ©
opening names of a well nigh endless list
of funny fellows whose work has amused
the present generation. It is useless to
treat each in detail. The work of one Is
the work of all. The multiplicity of cre
ators only serves to give the old materials
and the old Jokes new colorings and new
S *It is useless. Indeed, to try to look for
perfect originality in these latter days or
newspaper humor. New Jokes are almost
impossible. Wit. to be sure, is ephemeral,
but it is ephemeral only as to Its .form
and position. A true Joke Is Immortal,
but It travels down the centuries In con
stantly varying costume; to be presenta
ble It must follow the latest fashions.
Wendell Phillips has declared that all
Jokes can be traced to not over twenty
five parent witticisms, some of them as
old as history Itself. For Instance, in a
book published in the sixth century and
attributed to Hlerocles there are twenty
one Jokes which In modern dress arÂ« still
floating through our comic weeklies. ThÂ©
wit of our facetious Journals moves
through a very narrow rank of subjects.
It consists largelv of illustrated puns and
variations on a' few laughable topics UkÂ»
the tramp, the mother-tn-law. thÂ© wild
West desperado, the negro and the rural
inhabitant. Such work is not humor In ita
truest sense, and the creators of It can
expect to be remembered no longer .than
are the flying leaves for which thev write.

No other nation has produced so large a
mass of comic writings as has America
during the last four or five decades. Be
ginning with the mid years of the cen
tury, there arose a school of literary
comedians to which recruits havÂ© been
constantly added, and. as a result, news
papers and magazines and book stalls
have been flooded with burlesques and
witticisms. A mere list .of the literary
comedians who during the pÂ«rtod arose
at all above obscurity would more than
fill the column.
, The first conspicuous flgiaro among
American newspaper comedians was
George H. Derby, who, beginning; In the
early '50s, wrote under the pseudonym
"John Phoenix" many ludicrous sketches
which, were widely copied both at home
and abroad. The fun In "Phoenlxlana."
published in 1855, and in- "ThÂ© Squlbob
Papers" consists ., very often in an as
sumption of perfect innocence on the part
of the author and In a very plausible ex
planation of what on its face is absurd.
,For instance, Phoenix wishes to attend a
meeting of the "Ladies' Relief Society."
which Is to be exclusively for women, and
he, accordingly "from motives of delicacy
and a desire to avoid the appearance of
Intrusion," conceals himself on the floor
of one of the pews whejre he "lay perdue*
like an Innocent (green) snake among the
flowers listening to the merry laughter
and Innocent gurglings of delight"
. Another element of his humor lies in his
unexpected comparisons and Â¦ his naive
drollery. He speaks of an angry mule
that is passionately attached to a dray.
"The wind blew," he declares, "like well
watered roses." The library of a dis
tinguished San Francisco lawyer consists
of one volume of "Hoyle's Games." He of
fers the following as an antidote for fleas:
"On feeling the bite of a flea thrust the
part bitten Immediately into boiling
water. The heat of the watetr destroys
the insect and Instantly removes the pain
of the bite."
Phoenix was the first conspicuous writer
to use exaggeration deliberately and free
ly as a provocative of laughter. Irving
had used it frequently, but in "Phoenix
ana" it amounts to a mannerism and one
which of late years has come to be re
garded as peculiarly American. A cer
tain dentist, declares Phoenix, had con
structed a tooth-extracting machine of
tremendous power.
One day an old lady, feeble and flaccid,
came in to have a tooth drawn, and think
ing It would come out very easy. Tush
maker concluded. Just by the way of va
riety, to try the machine. He did so. and
at the first turn drew the old lady's
skeleton completely and entirely out of
her body, leaving her a mass of quivering
Jelly in her chair. Tushmaker took her
home In a pillow case. She lived seven
years after that and. they called her the
"lndlarubber woman." The dentist there
upon made a fortune selling small models
of the machine for boning turkeys.
This sounds like Mark Twain and Bill
Nye. .
Phoenix also introduced the method of
specific exaggeration so much used by
later wits. Several men trip over a rope
and fall upon the deck "and then fol
lowed what. If published, would make two
closely printed royal octavo pawes of pro
fanity." So grpat. he declares, was the
call for the Phoenix Herald that "we
have now 782 Indians employed night and
day In mixing adobe for the type molds,
and as no Fultable metal Is to be'forjna
in San Diego to cast the stereotypes, we
have engaged 224.000 ball cartridges from
the mission for the sake of the lead."
To Phoenix nothing was sacred, not
even religion and the Bible, and in solemn
mlsstatement and seemingly unconscious
misrepresentation he had nothlne to learn
from his later brothers. Indeed. Ameri
can newspaper comedy has not added
much to what it Inherited from John
Phoenix.
EKirlnr the late fifties and ear]y sixties
thp most popular series of newspaper
romedlps was the "Widow Bedott Pa
pers." written by Mrs. F. M. Whitrher.
Much of their substance Is really nothing
but broad farce, vet in parts they are Irre
sistibly funny. The garrulous old dam*Â» la
In reality a descendant of Mrs. Caudle.
Tier manifold experiences and tribulations
have had a great charm- for American
readers, and oven now the book Is in con
stant demand.
Another humorous creation nearly con
temporaneous with "Tho Widow Bedott"
wns P B. Shlllaber's "Mrs. Partlngton."
the American Mrs. Malaprop. The first
book of - the series was published In 1834.
and for more than a quarter of a renturv
"Mrs. Partlnston" was a household word.
Th*> dear old lady has opinions on every
topic und<?-r the pun. but it Is her fate
never to pet the precise word for which
she Is striving, nor to say the Idea as it
lies In her really shrewd and observant
mind. She discusses diseases In this man
ner:
Diseases Is very various. The doctor tells me
that poor old Mrs. Haz* has got two buckles
on her lungs! It Is dreadful to think of. I de
clare. Th*Â» dlnenses Is so various! One way
we hear of people's dying of hermitage of the
limps, another way of the brown creatures;
here they tell us of the elementary canal be
ing out of order, and there about tonsors of the
throat; here wÂ» hear of neurology In the head,
there of an embargo; one side of us we hear
of men being killed by getting a pound of
tough beef In the sarcofagu*. and there an
other kills himself by discovering his jocular
vein. ,
I am not so young aa I was once, she phil
osophizes, and I don't believe I *hal! evsr be,
if I live to the age of Famaon. which, heaven
knows, as well aÂ» I do. I don't want to. for
I wduldn't be a centurlan or an octagon, and
survive any factories, and become Idiomatic.
by any means.
Â¦"Isaac." said the dame; "taka the big tub
and drownd them kittens." There was de
termination In her eye and authority In her
tone and she clapped hÂ»r hands as he hastened
to obey her. "Ptop. Isaac, a minute." she
cried, "and I'll take the chin off the water;
It would be cruel to put 'em Into It stone cold."
Sbe took the steaming kettle from the stoVe
and emptied It Into the tub and left the rest
to Ike. iiV-iil
The popularity of Mrs. Partingrton was
almost eaual to that of the "Caudle Lec
tures" in England. There have been
many imitations, some of them of con
siderable originality â notably the 'Moslah
Allen's Wife" series by Marietta Holley.
"Peck's Bad Boy." which for a time gave
ax national circulation to Peck's Sun of
Milwaukee, was but a variation of the do-
Inss of Ike Partington. -Â» *
Doubtless the greatest of the distinc
tively newspaper comedians of America
has been Henry W. Shaw, who wrote un
der the pseudonym of "Josh Billings."
Shaw was a genuine philosopherâ a liter
ary descendant from Franklin. His writ
ings are composed of homely common
sense, shrewd observation, outrageous
Bpelllng and comic and unexpected trains
of thought and illustration. Unlike the
majority of his brother comedians. Shaw,
with all of his buffoonery, has a basis of
real merit which will raise a part of his
work to the level of those creations which
the world will not willingly let die. Some
of his maxims are as good as Franklin's,
and his definitions are Irresistible. Â¦ ;

As an example of Josh BMlnsrs at his
best one should read the "Essay on the
Muel" or "The Muskeeter":
Muskeeters are a game bug. but they won't
bite at a hook. Thar-? iz mlllyuns ov them

Of Shawâ almost alone of bts trtbÂ«â can
It be said that at times he Is a true hu
morist. He certainly based his writlnea
upon a large observation of human life,
and he was true to what he saw. It is
the first requisite of humor that It be ab

Carlyle, Its remaining requirement Is that

The wheat-laden ships Alclnous. Pericles
and Corunna came down from Port Costa
yesterday, while the Helensburgh and
Bermuda will come down this morning.
This means a fleet of nearlv a dozen ves
sels In the bay all ready for sea. Many
of them are having difficulty In securing
crews and the chances are It will be next
week before the last of them gets away.
THE sloop yacht Fawn caused con
siderable excitement along the
front yesterday. For a f ev, hours
It was feared that all the yachts
men had been drowned, but a
dose Investigation showed that all hands
were safe and the only damage was to the
yacht's Jlbbodm.
The Fawn left here - last "Wednesday
with a party of hunters, headed by C.
"Wyman, aboard. Thfy had some good
sport on the Alameda marshes and a "big
bag" was secured along the San Mateo
shore. On the way home the Fawn was
run down by n bcow schooner and her
bowsprit was carried away and her stand-
Ing rigging badly damaged. Captain Wy
man and his guests decided to go ashore
and seek assistance, and left the little
craft temporarily to Its fate. One of Tom
my Crowley - s launches was finally se
cured, but when the party returned to the
spot where the yacht had been abandoned
no trace of It could be found. The hunt
was kept t:p for five hours, and finally the
yacht was located tied up alongside a
schooner at Fremont-street wharf. As the
Fawn was a c'erellct the captain of the
schooner demands salvage, and there Is
likely to be a lawsuit over the matter.
When first picked up the Fawn showed
evidence of a hsuty departure on the part
of the creWi and that fact gave rise to
the rumor that all hands were lost
DIES IN A HOSPITAL.
Harold Hoffman Falls Three Stories
and Fractures His Skull.
A very rathetlc case was treated at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital yesterday.
Harold Hoffman, a lad still in his teens,
fell three stories down, an elevator shaft
and fractured his skull.
Young HoffnuÂ«n. whose home Is at 2013
Bush street, has been working for the C.
F. Marwedel Company. 58 First street, for
some time past. Yesterday he and Clay
McKenzie went to the third story of tho
building to have lunch. Harold looked
down through the half-open door of the
elevator shaft, end losing his balance fell
to the bottom of the well. The boy was
removed to the Harbor Hospital and later
to the Lane Hospital, where he died at 10
o'clock last night.
Algroa Arrives From Manila.
The steamer Algoa. chartered by the
United States as an army transport, ar
rived from via Nagasaki yester
day. She Is a big carrier, and rumor
has It that Uncle Sam has purchased
her for a cargo boat. The Algoa Is under
the British flag, but Is owned by the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company. She can
carry 10.000 tons of freight.
The Californian. owned by the Amerl
can-Hawf.llan line. Is one day behind the
Algoa. She should reach here to-night.
Rumor has It that she also will be added
to the transport fleet. The Californian is
even a bigger carrier than the Algoa.
Changes in Transport Captains.
Captain Schiller has been relieved from
the command of the transport Grant. In
fact, when the vessel came In Chief Of
ficer Brugnlere was In command and has
virtually been master ever since. It Is un
derstood that he will take command to
day and will be captain In name as well
as de facto.
There was - friction all throuph the
Grant's voyage between Captain Schiller
and Quartermaster Captain Baker. The
former was to llame for most of the trou
ble, or at least so the Government officials
have decided, and In consequence the res
ignation of Captain Schiller has been ac
cepted.
Captain Grant's resignation leaves a va
cancy on the 'Sherman, and It Is probable
that one of the mates scheduled for pro
motion will take her to Manila, and there
Captain Crosky of the hospital ship Relief
will take command. The man who takes
the Sherman to Manila will take com
mand of the Relief.
May Flint Libeled Again.
The Black Diamond Coal Company filed

fallen over the entire country north of the

ed to have fallen in the northern part of
the Sacramento Valley. Thore has been
no rainfall in Southern California. San

CRAWFORDSVIIXE, Ind.. Jan. 11.-
The rails of the Chicago and Southeastern
Railroad, which crosses the farm of Wes
ley Grantham, near this city, were torn
up and removed from 'the farm last
Wednesday night by Sheriff Canine, act
ing on a writ of ejectment secured by
Grantham In 1S34. All traffic, Including
the Government mail service, was effectu
ally blockaded.
Injunction proceedings were Immediate
ly filed against Grantham, but to-day.
in the 'Circuit Court, Judge West refused
to grant a temporary restraining order,
declaring that Grantham had already
been kept out of his property for seven
years, and that the constitution guaran
teed him certain rights with which the
court did not propose to interfere. The
road's attorney asked that an order be
made giving the road possession until the
land could be condemned, but the court
refused to do this, saying that the com
pany had had seven yeara to do this In
and had failed.
The court issued an order, however, for
bidding any further destruction of the
road's property.
Grantham's land Is gruarded by armed
men.
Last night two of the road's bridges
were blown up, one of them sixty feet
long and fifteen feet high. Many loads
of rails were carted off to a schoolhouse,
three miles from tho right of way.
Two hack loads of armed men went
down from Ladoga last night to the
Grantham farm. The road will be block
ed now for several days at least, and
Grantham's attorney declares possession
will not be relinquished untllthe road
pays $3000. \

OMAHA, Nebr.. Jan. U.â The residence
of Edward Cudahy was found to be on
fire to-night The flames were 'quickly
extinguished. The lire chief. Is not yet
satisfied as to whether the flre was of
incendiary origin or caused by spontan
eous combustion.
The incident has renewed the excite
ment over the famous Cudahy kidnaping
case as the elder Cudahy has been re
peatedly warned by letters from bandits
sincere offered the reward that his home
wouldybe burned If the reward was not
withdrawn. Mr. Cudahy gives it as his
personal opinion that the fire could not
have ,becn of incendiary origin. The fire
originated In the basement in a pile of
paper. In spite of this statement the im
pression is general in the city this even-
Ing that it is the work of kidnapers or
their Agents, In pursuance of their threats
to burn the Cudahy mansion unless the
reward for their apprehension was with
drawn. The flames were undoubtedly of
mysterious origin as a servant passed the
place a moment before the flames broke
out and detected no smoke, such as would
have been the caso in the event it had
been caused by spontaneous combustion.

Ah Tung, a Chinese about 40 years of
age, was arrested by Officer Mahoney yes
terday afternoon at 33 Spofford alley and"
taken to the Receiving Hospital. His
queer actions caused the doctors to doubt
his sanity and he was confined in the
insane ward. Shortly after midnight Ma
tron Bussenius heard a sound resembling
the falling of a chair coming from the
cell in which the Chinaman was confined".
Hastily summoning Steward Kahn, she
opened the cell door and found the Celes
tial hanging 1 from the grating forming the
roof of his cell. He was cut down and
after vigorous treatment restored to con
sciousness.
The Chinaman had taken a scarf from
about his waist ana, making a loop with
the aid of a large piece or jade stone with
a hole through the center, stood on the
chair and fastened the loose end of the
scarf to the grating. Jamming the stone
tight against his neck, he kicked the chair
from under him. He had been hanging
but a few momenta when he was cut
down. He is now occupying the cell, but
a 6traitjacket prevents any further at
tempts on his life.

THE annual meeting of the active
and contributing members of tho
Associated Charities was held yes
terday afternoon in the maple
hall of the Palace Hotel. Despite
the inclemency of the weather, there was
a large attendance of ladies and gentle
men who are interested in charity work.
The reports of the officers showed that
the society is in a prosperous condition
' and that much good was accomplished
during the past year. The report of the
registrar was particularly encouraging, as
it was shown that there was a noticeable
decrease in personal applications for aid.
This decrease is due to the improved! in
dustrial conditions.
During the year 1900 there were Â£61 new
and 439 recurrent cases reported and all
of them received the attention of the of
ficers of the society. Although the or
ganization has not been acting.in conjunc
tion with the Red Cross Society since Sep
tember last, the cases of 293 soldiers were
dealt with during the first three-quarters
of last year. The majority of the sol
dier applications were military offenders,
who had lost their pay for misdemeanors.
Work was secured for them through thd
efforts of the Associated Charities and the
Red Cross and they soon ceased to be de
pendent upon charity. There are forty
five churcho3 and societies now- acting in
co-operation with the organization' and
thanks were returned to them for the aid
extended. Among the new associations
to join hands with the Associated Chari
ties in the good work are the Chamber of

Church. Thanks were returned to the
heads of the several departments of the
municipal government and physicians
who gave their services to the poor and
needy.
Mrs. Thomas Cole, representing the
visiting nurse committee, reported that
every call had been cheerfully and will
ingly answered by the nurses, many of
whom gave more time to patients than
they could really spare In justice to them
selves. Many 'cases of sickness were
found to be due to poor sanitary condi
tions and when these cases were called to
the attention of the Board of Health the
defective plumbing was at once ordered
repaired. On the recommendation of Mrs.
Cole thanks were extended to the Univer
sity Dispensary for furnishing the society
with all drugs and medicines at cost.
The reuort of S. WÂ» Levy, treasurer of
the society, showed that there is a balance
of $1014 26 on hand, as against $303 31 on
January 1, 1901. The receipts from all
sources for the year nmounted to $3723 23
and disbursements $3217 30. The principal
source of revenue was from the Mary A.
Crocker trust fund and from lira. Phebe
A. Hearst. â¢ .

At the conclusion of the business meet-
Ing the Rev. Dr. William Rader aBOressed
the members on "The Relation , of the
Churches to Associated Charity Work."
He said that while the church was In duty
bound to care for the poor and needy of
its members, there was a great deal of
money needlessly wasted because of lack
of a uniform and systematic method of
carrying on the philanthropic work.
"The pastor of a church." he said, "is
often Imposed upon by those who with a
glib tongue tell a Eton* of suffering that
appeals to his heart and his pocket. To
personally Investigate every case is im
possible and the really needy are often
times compelled to suffer for the wrong
doings of the unworthy."
The speaker then advocated the appoint
ment of friendly visiting committees in
districts to be establjshed throughout the
city. The members' of these committees
would soon learn of the cause of po\ r ertv
In each family and the work of removing
the cause could be commenced in an intel
ligent way. To remove poverty from our
midst.- can, in his opinion, 'only be accom
plished by destroying the cause.
"Tho principal causes of distress," said
Dr. Rader, "are the saloons, slum centers
and shylock money-lenders. Co-evil with
saloons and slums are the money-lendera.
who advance money to the honest and
temporarily needy at extortionate rates of
interest."
1 In conclusion Dr. Rader recommended
the establishment of a bank where the
1 poor but honest, v/ho are in straitened
circumstances, may borrow money, the
X same as the rich, at a 1us>t and legal rato
is of. Interest, instead of 5per cent per
: month, as at present. *
U..I he "Â£ ev ,- P: w - Clampett spoke at con
siderable length concerning the workings
of charity organizations in Baltimore and
Dr. Dorothea Moore told of the good
practical results to be obtained from
friendly vlRltinjr among the poor, as sue
gested by Dr. Rader.
FAVORS LIMITING HEIGHT
OF FENCES TO TEN FEET
Supervisors' Committee Recommends
That the Ordinance Go Into
Effect Immediately.
The Supervisors' Hospital and Health)
Committee recommended yesterday that
the ordinance limiting the height of fences
to ten feet, which is to go into effect on
July 1, 1901, be amended so that it be op
erative immediately. This action is in tho
nature of a compromise on the ordinance
introduced by Supervisor Booth intended
to limit the height of fences to ten feet.
Booth urged the adoption of his measure
on the ground that fences higher than
eight feet are a menace to life and limb
especially in windy weather.

There was a tie-up on the Mission-street
electric line last evening, and in conse
quence many residents of tho Mission dis
trict found cold suppers awaiting them
when thoy reached their homes. The tie
up was the result of an attempt made by
a motorman to knock a wagon heavily
loaded with lumber off the track. Tbat
the driver escaped injury was due to the
fact that he Jumped to the ground before
the car collided with his team. The col
lision occurred a few feet distant from
the crossing of Fourteenth Btreet,- and
witnesses pay that * was due to the care
lessness of the motorman. who was run
ning his car at too high a rate of speed.
The driver of the wagon was swinging
his team from the south to tho north side
of Mission street when an eastbound car
came thundering along the track. There
was no time for the driver to clear the
track, and he did the best thing possible
under the circumstances. He sprang from
his seat, and the next Instant the car
struck the hind part of the wagon with
sufficient force to break the axle and
turn the team upside down on the north
track.
The conductor of the car, notebook In
hand, ran to the driver and demanded of
him his namo and address. .
"You'll find out suon enough who I
Â«im." replied the man, as he coolly pro
ceeded to unhitch the horses from his
wrecked wagon.
"Where are you going now?" asked the
carman. ,
"Home." was the reply.
"Hut what about the blockade on our
line? What are we going to do with this
wagon and lumber?"
"Don't know," answered the teamster,
as he FtarUni off with his horses. "You
fellows dumped the load there," he added,
softly, "and you can do Just what you
please with it."
The teamster proceeded on his home
ward way. and the westbound cars com
menced riling up one behind the other.
There was a blockade so far as that part
of the line was concerned until the wagon
and pile of lumber were hauled out of the
way. There was a consultation between
the railroad men. One of them suggested
that it might be a good thing to leave
the wreck etand where it was until they
could hear from headquarters. While
considerable time would be lost and the
passengers inconvenienced, that would be
offset in the railroad eyes, he said, by
furnishing the company a chance to pre
sent a counter claim for damages against
the teamster for Interrupting traffic on
the line.
After a score of cars were standing one
behind the other, the railroad hands con
cluded to go to work and remove the
wreck. It took them quite a time to toss
the lumber aside and then drag the wagon
from the track. The passengers who
were delayed took some little satisfaction
out of jeering and laughing at the con
ductors and motormen as they labored as
lumber handlers. -

GREAT FUTURE
FOR THIS CITY
WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF CHARITY
RECEIVE REPORTS FROM OFFICERS OF
THE GOOD ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR
The idea of holding a floral congress in
conjunction with its annual spring floral
exhibition was the cnler topjc of discus
sion at the annual meeting of the State
Floral Society yesterday. The members
present, were enthusiastic and the idea
immediately took rtfet. Committees are
to be appointed and the work of arrang
ing for the .congress will be taken, up at
once. ~. , .
The congress will be the second ever
held in this country and the third ever
convened In the world. The floral con
gress held during the World's Fair at
Chicago In 1533 arousad the interest of
horticulturists throughout the civilized
world. Tha one held some months ago at
the Paris Exposition was not successful.
Judging by the reports received from the
French capital. It Is ihe intention of the
State society to make the third floral con
gress surpass in interest and usefulness
previous affairs of its kind.
In conjunction with the congress, the
society will hold its regular spring ex
hibition. The blooms of California will
be shown In all their glory and fragrance.
Invitations will be extended to- all horti
cultural societies west of the Rockies to
send delegates and it is confidently as
serted that many prominent horticultur
ists will attend.
Professor Emory E. Smith of Stanford,
who presided at the meeting yesterday,
talked ai length on the project. He said
the society would receive co-operation in
its undertaking and he prophesied suc
cess. He suggested tl-at a general com
mittee should be appointed to have charge
of the arrangements and that this com
mittee should be composed of representa
tive people interested in the various
phases of horticulture.
Acting on his suggestion, the chairman
whs empowered to aopolnt such a com
mittee. A number of pamphlets on fight-
Ing the frost were received from Director
McAdle of the Weather Bureau and dis
tributed among the members. Reports
were heard from different officers. Treas
urer J. Henderson's report showed that
the late flower show netted $63 72. He said
this was gratifying as it was usual for the
society to draw on its funds to meet the
expenses of a show. He said 5363 90 had
been expended during the past twelve
months and a balance of $196 21 was in
the treasury.
Mrs. H. J3. Trlcou and Mrs. L. Gunnison,
secretary and accountant, respectively,
presented reports. Tho secretary stated
that sixty new members had been re
ceived during: the year. The organization
lost one by death, eight resigned and five
were dropped for non-payment of dues,
leaving 139 members, ninety-five of whom
are residents of this city.
An expression of sympathy was ex
tended to Professor E. J. TVIekson, a
former president of the organization, who
was recently bereaved by the loss of his
mother. Mrs. LÂ» O. Ilodgkins was re
quested to express the sorrow of the
members. ââ¢
The following 1 nominations werÂ« made
of officers, who will be elected at the next
meeting:

CHICAGO, Jan. 11.â There was a larger trade
In wheat than for days past, but It was of a
mysterious sort and confined largely to two
firms.
Otherwise the market was a, dull one. Ar
mour bought 1.500,000 bushels and a commis
sion firm sold about that much. Some thought
the buying was In the way of evening up
Armour's trades in order to settle the estate
of the late P. D. Armour. It was also re
ported that the operations had to do with
Judge Tulley's adverse warehouse decision an
nounced yesterday, although in what way was
not made plain. Outside Interests were not
In the market to any extent. Demand Invari
ably met with liberal response from longs
Lower cables, heavy receipts, Increased Ar
gentine shipments and favorable news from
that country were depressing factors. May,
having opened a shade to %@%c lower at 77V4
077%o, sold during the forenoon between 77U
Â©77&C and 77%c, later dropped to 76%c and
clcsed steady %<3%c lower at 77%c. The recov
ery from the bottom in the last few minutes
was on profit-taking by shorts.
Corn was quiet with the trade small In vol
ume and; without feature. The market was
Inclined to sympathize with wheat and to
weaken on the receipts, 6C0 cars, but the fear
of bad weather shutting oft the movement
tended to steady prices. May closed VÂ»c lower
Oats were quiet and Bteady. Country offer-
Ings were light and there was a good demand
from shippers. Receipts were 358 cars. May
cloaed 'Ac lower.
Provisions were dull, opening lower In sym
pathy with lower hog prices, steadying on mod
erate bull support. May pork closed 6c higher
May ribs a shade improved and May lard a

STOCK MARKET.
Bonds have also been very strong and the
scarcity of offerlnirs of prime Issues is still a
feature. The etreet Itself seems less Inclined
to fear an Immediate culmination of the
"boom" than It was a few weeks aeo and the
activity on a scale which under or
dinary conditions mlzht have been sup
posed to mark the turning point In the
speculation created little actual misgivings on
the part of speculators. Pools in certain stocks
seem to have realized, but other securities have
been taken in hand and advanced In their
place, and the success with which it has been re
peated creates a feeling that the press can go
on for some time to come, though stocks which
have been unduly advanced recede to more mod
erate quotations and the market is a large suf
ferer from temporary general reactions. The
supcort given by large Interests to these spÂ«
eialttes has not, apparently, been withdrawn,
and new combinations among the railroads are
expected to be announced even if actual facts
In seme instances do not agree with specula
tive anticipations.
Trade upon a larger scale than Wall street
has ever seen marked the end of last week
and the beginning of the present one. The facts
that on last Saturday in the two hours of
business n.t the New York Stock Exchange
1.777.000 shares chanced hands, and that on
Monday, January 7, the high water mark for
a full day was reached with recorded dealings
of over 2.000,000 shares. Illustrates the size of the
present market. This was due to the effect on
speculation of the deal by which the Jersey
Central road has l>een acquired for the Reading
Company, supplemented by the general belief
thai a foundation existed for the rumors con
cerning the acquisition of the St. Paul Com
pany and perhaps of other western systems by
certain corporations. Enormous realizing sales
were met by buying on an equally remarkable
scale, and the public Interest appeared to be
Increasing its participation In the speculative
movement. Later in the week, while the vol
ume of transactions continued laree, the tone
became quieter and there was a subsidence of
the excitement, accompanied by more or less
reactionary tendencies. This was partly occa
rasloned by the fact that the growing ease of
money here and the tendency of funds to re
turn to New York from the interior Is in de
cided contrast to the continued pressure upon
the London money market, which creates an
urgent demand for our assistance there, re
flected in the further rapid rise of foreign ex
chanee rates at New York this week and the
prospect that some gold will have to be shipped
to the ether 6ide. While the bank statement
of last Saturday was satisfactory, and It is
felt that some specie can be loaned to London
without any risk of producing pressure in our
money market, the outlook Internationally Is
one which would tend to foster conservatism
Even more effective, however, were develop
ments which seemed to indicate that the street
was oversaneiilne about plans of the finan
ciers who were supposed to be preparing
fresh combinations concerning St. Paul ana
other railroads, and the announcement of pros
pective competition by the Carnegie Company
with the National Tube Company, the last
news belnK particularly depressing In Its ef
fects on the industrials. It must, however, be
admitted that at concessions there was appar
ently a good buying demand for stocks and
that the Investment market shows no exhaus
tion of the buying power. In fact, notwith
standing, large purchases apparently for Invest
ment have been seen in stocks which like Mis
souri Pacific have advanced on the strength of
Intimations that their restoration to the posi
tion . of dividend payers Is at hand.

NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â The furious buying of
Delaware and Hudson and Ontario and West
era In the last hour of the market saved the
day on the Etock Exchange from something
like positive dullness. After the recent high
level of speculative excitement, traders were
unable to diÂ£tir-g"u!sh the tone of the market
froru dullness, so etrong was the contrast, and
j-Â«t there were notable advances In the price of
important Etocks tr.i a ccale of trading that
uouid have attracted marked attention previous
to last November. Tae recent attempts to
awaken a general speculation In the Southwest
em con-.rner.surate with that which has oc
curred in ether groops were apparently aban
doned to-day. The general decline In the buy-
Inx derr.&sd led to large selling to take profits,

the market was under considerable pressure
from this selling. A growing Ekecticism re

ALEXANDER G. McADIE.
Forecast Official.
Failures for the week were 324 in the United
States, again 274 last year, and 37 In Canada,
against 25 last year.
Wool has ceased to decline and sales at the 1
three chief Eastern markets increased slightly
to 3.3CS.70O, against 3,121.000 in the week preced
ing. Manufacturers purchase with great cau
tion and domestic fleeces suffer by increased
competition of cheap wool from Australia and
China. Makers of boots and shoes insist on full
prices and as a result shipments from Boston
have declined 5450 cases for the week While the
[hide market at Chicago is unchanged the tone
Is Irrejrular.
Investment o<" Wall-street capital was ru
mored as supporting cotton and wheat, but
the eiTect was not permanent. Cotton ad
vanced temi>orarily, only to react when Liver
pool cables failed to respond. Wheat was agi
tated by reports of a corner in the May option
and for a time exhibited strength. A sharp
reaction followed, holders parting readily with
their contracts. Desnlte the advance of about
10 per cent over the price a year ago Atlantic
exports show an Increase of 3,255.053 bushels,
flour Included, against 2.315.9SS in 1900.
Construction of bridges and buildings, to
gether with contemplated track elevation,
crowds the capacity of all concerns making
structural shapes of iron and steel. Orders
for locomotives, cars, rail and all forms of
railway equipments- are also abundant, and
there Is no tlgn of reaction in the industry.
Plate and sheet mills have large business and
merchant steel Is in brisk demand. Competi
tion Is keen, however, and Increased operations
fail to affect prices. New schedules are prom
ised In the near future and lower freight rates
are anticipated. Stocks decreased slightly in
December, but there is fear of accumulation
and quotations at Plttsburg and Philadelphia
have declined during the past week.
Only In the textiles is special hesitation
Bhown. Staple products are firm, iron and
steel prices are h<?ld without trouble, boots and
shoes and wool are steady and all with fair
demands, so that manfacturers are busy. In
textiles, however, the improvement which
seemed to be promised with the new year is
still delayed and In cotton goods stocks are
growing In some quarters, though still not op
pressively heavy anywhere. Throughout the
country distribution of merchandise continues
on a good scale and collections are unusually
prominent.
NEW YORK, Jan. 11.â R. G. Dun & Co.'Â»

New York Money Market.
American shares were torpid. They opened
well under parity and there was a definite dis
position to sell here, but there was a sharp
rally after New York opened. New York
sent over buying orders In Union Pacific and
Norfolk and Westerns. After this department
gagged, rallied again and was quite strong.
Th* street In London regards the boom In
Americans as over and the latest news from
Hill is taken as evidence that the Morgan
people are out.
Money wan a little tight and the bank Is
etill borrowing to stiffen rates.

Is lessened thereby. English and Colonial

consumption of coal must be seriously dimin
ishing, aa the yards are all overladen, and
arrivals are fully equal I to all immediate re
quirements, hence stock* on hand are not les
sened. Jobbers are complaining about the vol
ume of business In all lines. Even In household
grades, which at this season should be exceed
ingly active, the sales are light. This may l>Â«
partially attributed to the increased introduc
tion of gas stoves, which always happens when
domestic fuel la high. Coal quotations for
steora purposes are low enough, lower than
laÂ« year, and contracts are now being mads
at shaded prices for future delivery. This is
mainly caused by the Influx of fuel oil. which

again lower to 65s Id, and Mlddlesboro 4Ss.

Bradstreefs on Trade.
Â¦wool sales is noted at Eastern markets, . but
weather conditions have not been favorable at
the East to business as a whole, except as
stimulating the retail trade In shoes and rub
ber roods. A special feature is the generally
good tenor of reports as to collections from all
Western and Southern points, from which it is
Inferred that trade relations to retailers must
hava been quite good. Summed up briefly the
situation 1b one of widespread confidence in
the general business outlook.
Cereals have given a further exhibition of

receipts and advices' that Argentine receipts
will not exceed 35,000.000 bushels, or about half

tion and stocks are reported smaller than a
month ago. There are only two Idle furnaces
now in the Chicago district.
Cotton has weakened on discouraged bull
liquidation due to largsr receipts, while cotton
goods have been quiet on the advices of a
backward spring trade in the East. Wool has
been in rather better demand than of late,
due to better buying by manufacturers. A
better business has been booked in overcoating
on next fall account ct lower prices, but the
regular heavyweight seaeon has not yet opened.
Plain dressgoods are being ordered quite freely,
but the fancies are neglected. Jobbing busi
ness In shoes Is quieter, but Is quite good, at
retail. Travelers are now going out with fall
styles of chocs, which will sell slightly lower
than last year.

"WOODLAND, Jan. 11.â As a result of a
disagreement between the City Trustees
and City Attorney Anderson, city finances
are involved In a hopeless tangle. Last
year both the County and City Assessors
listed a lot of wheat receipts in the pos
session of the Bank of Woodland on the
assumption that they are solvent credits.
The bank disputed the validity of the as
sessment. The District Attorney advised
the County Assessor that it was best to
assess the receipts and allow the courts
to pass on the validity of the assessment.
The bank paid the county and State tax
under protest. The City Attorney advised
the city board that the assessment was
illegal and the City Treasurer accepted
the bank's taxes on real estate, allowing
the tax on personal property to become
delinquent. As a result the city will bo
plaintiff in any proceedings that may be
taken In the courts. .'. Matters were still
further complicated to-day when the
Trustees served a demand upon the City
Treasurer requiring ; him to enforce the
collection of the tax. If he refuse to do

STILL MISSING
IS THE ANDRADA
Belief Is Bee: ming General
That the Ship Has
Gone Down.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Jan. 11.â The British ship
Andrada has now been missing about a
month and hope for the vessel has been
abandoned by many persons interested in
shipping. The Andrada is a ship of 2390
tons and reached the Columbia Just be
fore the gales which recently swept the
coast. Pilot Cordlner of this port was
taken aboard, but he never made port.
A great storm came up and the Andrada
disappeared.
The disappearance of this fine ship is
Identically the same as that of the Brit
ish bark Cadzow Forest, which appeared
off the Columbia in the fall of 1S95. Pilot
Grassman was taken aboard. The gales
which arose swept the Dark to the north,
and she was never again seen. A life
buoy found on the coast of Vancouver
Island told< the mute story of the gallant
vessel's hopeless struggle with the ele
ments.
There seems little doubt that the An
drada has met a similar fate. The reve
nue cutter Perry has gone out to search
for the missing ship. The belief is gen
eral that the Andrada has turned turtle,
and as she was a steel ship In all proba
bility she sank with all on board.

to her mother, simply says:
"You will never see me strain. Maybe
some day I will coine home. By the time
you find this note I will be miles and miles
away. Your unhappy daughter,
"MAY."
Mrs. Norton is unable to advance any
reason why her daughter should run
away. She says the girl had everything
bTiq wished for, and as far as she knew
had no reason to be unhappy.
This afternoon the police received in
formation that Marie Hailstone, an 18
year-old girl. Is missing from her home.
An Investigation resulted In bringing to
light the fact that May Norton and Miss
Hailstone were very friendly, and fur
ther inquiries made by detectives show
that Miss Hailstone several days ago told
a number of her friends that it was her
Intention to leave Seattle soon, and that
they would never hear from her again.
She added that a girl friend, who was
very dear to her, would leave with her.
The police are certain that if the Hail

reign in Ireland.

mor as to the health of Lady Curzon,

A large expanse of green lawn stretches
in front of Mr. Bennett's fine home on
Buena Vista avenue. He Is a fancier of
fine breeds of chickens. He likes to have
the stock roam around the grounds, be

that the greenness of the grass has be

An Oregon boot, with a centrifugal
split second movement, fitted to the limbs
of a fowl, designed to automatically throw
the wearer out of the beaten track every
time it attempts to scratch. The machine
looks like a pneumatic overshoe. It Is

fowl by means of leather straps, being
prevented from sliding up or down by an
extra twist around the spur. Every time
the chicken stoops down, which nature
requires It to do before it commences to
work, it Inadvertently sticks the protrud
ing edge of Mr. Bennett's Invention into
the blue grass. The chick is then up
against it. The more it scratches the fas
ter it pushes Itself off the lawn. Under

to-night, a resolution was adopted asking
the Legislature to make an appropriation
to build a highway from Bakersfleld *o

taken up at both ends of the line. The

for It and Assemblyman Merrttt was
asked to support it. State Highway Com

here to look over the field, once going
over the proposed route with a committee
from the chamber. He reported favor

LEAVES HISCURSE
IN A TESTAMENT
A TEAMED A.. Jan. 11.â A flre that for a while threatened
to burn up everything In sight, including several mil
lion pallors of petroleum and refined oil, broke out this
afternoon at the Pacific Coast Oil Works at the ex
treme western end of the city. As it was, a building
that had just been completed was almost totally destroyed, en
;..-.â¢Â¦ l- a loss on the oil works company of alwut $5000.
The fire was caused by the overheating of a large quantity
cf oil that was going through the process of refinement in one
of the big stills at the works. The ga^es generated by the
heat from the oil did not escape quickly enough through the
venta made for tht-ir discharge, with the result that the man
hole cover at the tcp of the etill was forced off by the extraor
dinary pressure against It.
A moment later the flames from the white heat flre beneath
The' fire In the storage building was not got under control
until the structure had been nearly burned to the ground. It
contained only a lot of asphalt and some empty tanks.
the still communicated with the escaping gas and the flames
shot high In the air In an Immense column of fire that touched
the top of a 150-foot chimney which stands within a few feet
of the long row of stills in that department of the \rorks. The
southeast wind blew the flames over until they, licked the Bides
of the new corrugated iron storage building. 200 feet distant.
This structure was soon afire. While awaiting the arrival of
the local Fire Department the employes of the works did what
they could to save the other tanks and buildings from being
destroyed. The oil in the blazing still was drawn off from be
neath and conducted to another tank. As soon as the still was
emptied of the oil the fire went out.

"In such extreme cases," said the wit
ness. "I should say cruelty describes It
best, because it causes pain."
"Now. which of these describes the form
of hazing- practiced by West Point upper
classmen when a man Is pushed to the
limit of his endurance?"
Cadet Edward H. Dearmond of Missouri
said he had given fifteen drops of tropi
cal pepper sauce to Cadets Pegram and
Koselle, but to.no others. He also hazed
Williams, who' was afterward dismissed,
and a cadet named Davy. Congressman
Driggs asked the young Missourlan to
listen to his reading three words and
their meaning from the dictionary. The
words were: "Barbarous," "brutal" and
"cruel."
"He was the worst case here. He had
convulsions, and it took quite a while to
bring him around. I saw him In bed
whimpering hysterically."
"What about MacArthur?"
The witness said he had been dismissed
from the academy about a year, but had
gone to Washington and secured his re
instatement. His dismissal was connected
with hazing offenses of which the authori
ties had become cognizant.
Cadet O. N. Taylor of Maryland testi
fied that he had been eagled 4W times for
no offense at all, made to change from
a stretcher and made to do other things.
He came near fainting. Witness refused
to tell at first who hazed him, but the
committee decided he must answer and
he did. saying Cadet Evans, since ex
pelled, and Cadet A, J. Barry of the pres
ent first class were the hazers.
"Who hazed MacArthur?"
"There were two men, of whom Cadet
Dockery was one."
Taylor told of the hazing of Carpenter,
one of his classmates, when Cadet Myer
of the present first class Interrupted the
hazers and made them desist. Carpenter
was put to bed suffering from muscular
convulsions. He was also hysterical and
delirious.
Some of the Congressmen wanted to
know why the cadets did not settle "af
fairs of honor" with the army six-shooter,
but the witness said he thought In that
case the fourth class men would be at a
worse disadvantage than in a bare
knuckle contest-
Cadet Spauldlng said Mr. Huelzler of the
class of 1902, an unpopular man, had been
dismissed on account of demerits. Wit
ness admitted that officers were inclined
to ignore delinquencies except in cases of
unpopular nwn.
Cadet "Jphn K. Herr of New Jersey said
he hazed whenever he got a chance. Cadet
Grant was among his victims.
The testimony then reverted to the
Booz-Keller fight, bringing out nothing
new.
WEST POINT, N. Y., Jan. 11.â The Con
gressional committee which has been in
vestigating the hazing of West Point
cadets resumed its labors to-day. Cadet
George R. Spauldtng of Michigan, who
acted- as timekeeper at the Keller-Booz
fight, was the first witness called, and,
after being sworn, was examined by Con
gressman Wanger. He said he was an
ex-offlcio member of the "scrapping com
mittee," being vice president of his class.
"Is that a standing committee?"'
"Yes, sir, but there is not as much use
for it now as there was some time ago."

ers Considered Dan-

ATLANTA, Ga_, Jan. ll.-Dr. Herbert
H. McAuley of Chicago, who recently re
turned to the United States from South
Africa, where he was engaged In the Red
Crcs3 service, has written the Associated
Press from Marietta, Ga,. regarding his
claim of $100,000 Indemnity against the
Portuguese Government for alleged false
Imprisonment. The doctor says the re
port that the Secretary of State at Wash
ington cabled him at Paris not to talk
about the matter Is untrue.
"I did go to "Washington," writes Dr.
McAuiey, "before I agreed not to talk
about my case and was cordially received
by the State Department. I received in
structions how to .proceed in the matter,
and am now having the proper affidavits
made out and In a few days my demand
for $100,000 indemnity will be made."
The Atlanta Journal this afternoon
printed an amplified statement from Dr.
McAuley regarding the affair. Phe doc
tor says In part:
"On reaching Lourenzo Marques, where
I expected to take ship for Europe on my
way home. I was arrested by an officer
and marched to jail. I demanded to know
for what reason I was detained, out no
satisfaction was given me. The same
evening I sent word to Mr. Hpllls, the
American Consul, to come to. the prison
to see me and then to forthwith demand
my release, as I had violated neither the
laws of Portugal nor the obligation which
I had taken.
"The Consul refused to come or In any
way to Interfere or intercede In my be
half. , . ' . *
"After having remained in prison for
two days I was informed that I would
be released providing I would remain. In
the company of an officer until the time
for the next transport to sail for Eu
rope. This conditional offer I declined
to accept, and was ordered to jail at the
police barracks, a prison for political of
fenders. From there I was ordered into
the presence of the Governor of Lourenzo
Marques, who again ordered my release
conditionally as stated. This I again de
clined and was returned to prison.
"After having demanded all that an
American citizen couK. demand under the
circumstances, I again appealed to the
Governor to allow me one of three things
as an American cltizon: First, to be re
leased unconditionally; second, to be
given a fair trial; third, to be allowed to
cable our Minister at Lisbon, all of which
was denied, and the guard was ordered
to carry me aboard the transport.
"I then asked to be allowed to appeal
to the British Consul. This was also de
nied, but while on my way to the vessel
my friend and I determined to appeal to
the British Consul, and, despite tho pro
tests of the guard, we went to the Con
sul, who at first refused to interfere, say-
Ing that it would be discourteous to the
American Consul. After showing him a
letter which General Roberts had given
me and which convinced him of my ser
vices to the sick and dying of- his coun
try, he made a request of the Governor
General, and his request was granted. 1
â¢was returned to the prison again, until
the first vessel for Europe sailed, when
I was furnished a first-class ticket and
a sum of money, this money having been
sent to me by the Boer commander, Gen
eral Botha.
"When ordered from the prison to the
ship on which I sailed I was not per
mitted to get any of my personal effects
or property."
Dr. McAuley expects to go to Wash
ington in a few days.
Portuguese Officials Refused to Give
Him a Trial or Allow Him
tire Freedom of the
City.

"The Future of Relf'gion" was the sub
ject of an address by Rabbi Nleto at the"
synagogue at Post and Taylor streets last
evening. He eloquently dwelt on the man
ner in which religion Is practiced at the
present time and compared It with the re
ligion as practiced in Biblical times. He
stated that the world -was in need of a
true religion in every sense of the word;
not one as represented by building costly
houses of worship or the attendance In
these buildings on stated occasions. True
religion and the religion of the future
must be practical and not theoretical. We
must have something with which to train
our religious feelings and find some active
work to do and do it.
The claim for a new religion which must
be practical was not. however, a new idea.
It dated back to the time of Israel. The
true religion can be found in the Bible,
for it held out no hopes which cannot be
realized by man. To be honest and Just,
pure and moral, that your days may be
prolonged in the land, is the idea of the
future religion, and these precepts are to
be found in the sacred writings. Skepti
cism had so crept in that we must come
back to a reasonable acceptance of tho
ancient doctrines.
The writers of the Bible would not to
day recognize their work, so much have
the writings been twisted. While people
are willing to pay a large sum to hear

they are not willing to pay for an ex

venerated by countless millions, was less

modern poets. Sermons were but the ex

County Clerk Deane yesterday Issued a
statement of the number of marriage cer
tificates issued and divorce cases com
menced in the city and county of San
Francisco during the period from January
2 to December 21, 1900. The number of
marriage certificates Issued was 3533.

legal separation were 1043.
John E. Bennett and their client, Wong
Chung, made another legal assault on
Federal Quarantine Officer J. J. Klnyoun
yesterday by filing an amended complaint
In the action against the Quarantine Of
ficer and the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany In the United States Circuit Court,
reciting that the steamship company and
Dr. Kinyoun have refused to deliver to
Wong Chung a cargo of Chinese food
stuffs " and other things shipped from
Hongkong on November 17, although the
vessel had been granted free pratique,
/'with exceptions that all dried fish, oys
ters, dried meats and vegetables from
Hongkong are not to be taken off the
vessel unless on special certificates, and
all Chinese and Japanese foodstuff, such
as yams, water chestnuts. Illy bulbs,
sugar cane, green ginger, bamboo shoots
and taro, to be landed only after a cer
tificate." I
The allegation Is made that the food
stuffs are wholesome and free from infec
tion or contagion, and that the bichloride
of mercury and other chemicals used in
fumigating are absolutely destructive of
food products. Hence Chung asks for a
mandatory writ commanding the defend
ants to release the goods, and enjoining
Dr. Kinyoun from fumigating or other
wise interfering with the same. The com
plaint asks also for J3000 damages.
*. , I* said yesterday that he had
held the goods on the Coptic because he
!\f d T r T e 9 el^ ed a letter from John w - K err,
the United States service officer at Hong
kong informing him that the foodstuffs
had been smuggled on board the Coptic
ft Hongkong, and that Dr. Kerr was
thereby prevented from inspecting the
same. He (Dr. Kerr) had therefore re
fused to grant free pratique to the Cop- :
tic, and it was upon this letter,
as well as instructions from the 'United
States Surgeon General at Washington,
that Dr. Kinyoun refused to allow the
goods to be delivered. Assistant United
States Attorney Banning will file answer
on behalf of the defendants, and the mat
ter will be argued before United States
Circuit Judge Morrow at 11 o'clock next
Monday morning. Â«

ASKS FOR MANDATE
AGAINST KINYOUN
When the contest was instituted It was
intimated that the partisans of one of
the contesants had been guilty of gross
fraud, but as the lecount proceeded and
no revelation of dishonesty became ap
parent it began to be thought that these
suspicions were groundless. But yester
day's recount served to revive them. In
the Fourteenth Precinct of the Forty
fourth district twenty-two of Judge
Dalngerfield's votes were thrown out',
leaving him but twenty-six. According
to this count forty-iight votes must have
been cast for him during the election.
The election judges credited him with
only receiving thirtv-eight. On the other
hand the recount showed that Graham
had only received sixty votes In that pre
cinct, yet he was accredited with having
received sixty-four.
The only vestige of hope now for Gra
ham and his supporters is that when the
recount enters the districts which Dain
gerfleld carried the ratio of ballots thrown
out because of mistakes and distinguish- ,
ing marks will be against Daingerfleld.
This is indeed a forlorn hope, as those
districts are the homes of the mer'y.<Â»nts
and of men whose position in life render
them not liable to make mistakes in bal
loting.
At the close of yesterday's recount in tho
Superior Judgeship contest the total gain
of Judge DalngerfleM over hla opponent.
Thomas F. Graham, was nineteen votes.
The friends of Dalngeirteld are now san
guine of victory_^and are rejoicing and
receiving congraTulatlons. while the sup
porters of Graham are dejected and dis
couraged. It appears to be the consensus
of opinion at present, not only among the
friends and partisans of Daingerfleld. but
among <he disinterested spectators who
have followed the course of the canvass
from day to day. that when the final re
sult la ascertained he will, be shown to
have been elected beyond the shadow of
a doubt. Up to the present time, with not
one-half of the citv yet counted, he ha3
gained a total of 233 votes.

Exciting Scene at th3 Examination
ACCUSES FRIEDMAN
OF UNFAIR DEALING
The trick of sticking an ax into the head
of another player has been seen many
times on the stage, but It always gets a
big laugh. The ax which Hartman uses
is made of wood and has two sharp nails
fitted in the edge of the weapon. The
actor w.ho receives the blow wears a
wooden block under his wig,' into which
the nails enter, leaving the weapon to all
purposes burled in the skull.
On Wednesday night the wooden block
which Kavanagh wore under his wig
slipped to the back of his head, Just be
fore Hartman was to do the "ax trick."
"Ha, ha," said Hartman as Buttons,
"here comes that ugly sister of 'Cinders.'
Just watch me swat her one on the head."
Creeping up , to Kavanagh, Hartman
p'Tf"^ HERE was an unrehearsed scene
I at the Tivoli on Wednesday night.
I which resulted in Actor Fred
JJL Kavanagh receiving- severe scalp
wounds inflicted with an ax wield
ed by Ferris Hartman. the comedian of
the company.
Kavanagh plays the part of one of th-s
sisters. of Cinderella and Hartman dis
ports In the revelry of the role of "But
tons," an attendant to the maid who wore
the glass slipper.
When Hartman wrote the play of "Cin
derella" for the Tlvoli, he arranged a
scene in which Buttons strikes Cinder
ella's sister on the head with an ax and
leaves the weapon sticking In the skull
of the actor who plays the part.
In the ten recent cases known as the
"handbook cases." In which the arrests
were made by Policeman Levings, eight
have been settled by the defendants plead
ing guilty and In the remaining: two the
defendants will . also plead guilty to-day
One of the defendants who pleaded guilty
in Judge Fritz's court yesterday was A.
Victor, who had demanded a trial by Jury,
and 175 talesman had been examined, but
only three Jurors were secured.
Chief Sullivan has gained a complete
victory over the poolsellers and this morn
ing all of the cases on the police court
calendars embraced in the much-talked-of
stipulation will be wiped out, Zick Abrams
having come to the conclusion that It is
not worth the candle to fight the Police
Department alone, even with Attorney
George D. Collins backing: him.
There were twenty-six cases on the cal
endars Wednesday 'and twenty-one of
them were then disposed of by the defend
ants pleading â¢ guilty/ Zick Abrams had
five cases against himself and clerks and
in each case he demanded a Jury trial and
the cases were continued to be set. Yes
terday morningr Abrams told Attorney
Coffey, the special prosecutor, that he
would plead guilty in all of the five cases
and they were put back * on yesterday's
calendars. Two were disposed of and the
other three will be settled to-day, when
the defendants can appear In court.
"The other poolsellers have pleaded
guilty," said Abrams, "and If they think
I am fool enough to buck singly against
the Police Department they are very
much mistaken. I consider it the wiser
course to follow suit."

Lot, Agrees to Stay by

POOL SELLERS GIVE
UP THE FIGHT
Hartman realized that a serious accident
had happened, as Kavanagh lay uncon
scious on the stage. Fearing to alarm the
audience, Hartman, with presence of mind,
picked Kavanagh up and carried him to
the wings, the audience laughing as tho
comedian said. "Well, she's done for this
time."
"Doc" Leahy, the manager of the house,
took a hand in reviving Kavangh until a
real medico arrived. Some stitches were
put in Kavanagh's scalp, and though it
was feared yesterday that blood polsonlntr
might ensue from the wound, Kavanagh
was able to play last night, but the "ax
trick was cut out of the play.
brought the ax down on the little fellow's
head and Kavanagh rolled to the -floor.
"Well, wouldn't that bump you," Bald
Hartman, as the audience roared with
laughtc at the discomfiture of Kava
nagh in the role of "Cinders' " sister.
But the laughter vanished quickly from
Hartman's face as he saw a stream of
blood running down Kavanagh's head and
chest.

RICHARDS WOULD
BE NOME MARSHAL
In a counter affidavit Moraghan quotes
the ante-nuptial agreement referred to
and sets forth his explanation of the way
In which It was destroyed. Continuing
he denies that he is trying to dispose of
his interest in his mother's estate to de
feat his wife's claim, but claims that he
is in receipt of only $60 a month, of which
$50 a month Is paid him for his services
as an employe of the Moraghan Oyster
Company and $10 a month comes to him
from his mother's estate.
His claim is supported by Henry B.
Clement and his brother, Charles A. Mor
aghan, who filed affidavits setting forth
the same facts. Young Moraghan, who Is
but 23 years of age, places special em
phasis on his assertion that all the
troubles between himself and. wife are due
to the interference and rapacity of his
parent8-ln-law and in conclusion he prays
that her prayer for a decree of divorce
and alimony pendente lite be denied.
After hearing the various affidavits read
Judge Seawell took the motion for ali
mony under advisement and will file his
opinion within a week.
In an affidavit filed yesterday on her
motion for alimony. Mrs. Moraghan says:
"The plaintiff admits that at various
times, and mostly when drunk, the de
fendant professed the utmost regard for
her, but since her marriage and as evi
dence of his warm affection for her he has
given her. in all, one dress of the value of
$14, and three several amounts of $3 each,
a total of $3, which, with the value
of the dress, makes $23 In all since she
was married." >
Young Moraghan enters a general denial
to all cf his wife's allegations, though he
admits "that when his wife Insisted on as
sociating with her mother} whom he con
siders an Improper person, he used strong
language." On November 25, 1900. their
baby daughter, Eugenia, was born, he
continues, and his wife added to his dis
comfort by threatening to get rid of the
child. This forced him to remove the
babe from their home "and support her
elsewhere at great expense," he says,
which made him extremely angry at his
wife. After making the charges stated
above he alleges that his wife was taken
from his home against hl3 will and
against hers by her father, "who is
largely responsible for their trouble."
After taking her away, he continues, she
was permitted to associate with her
mother, who lives at the Repeller Hotel,
greatly to his discomfort, and finally se
cured apartments at 632 Haight street,
where she lives, but which place Is closed
against him. He has frequently expressed
his regard for his wife, he alleges, and
still bears affection for her, but is pro
vented from conducting himself as he
would like, owing to the action of her
patents.
'"Owing to the drunken and degraded
habits of the defendant," she concludes,
"it is impossible to live at peace with him
and if she should presume to live with
him* It would be at the risk of her life."
In addition to a decree of divorce, Mrs.
Moraghan demands judgment for perma
nent alimony and an order restraining
her husband from incumbering his estate,
which, she alleges. Is valued at $20,000.
On one occasion, she contends, at their
heme, 132& Waller street, he seized her
by the throat and was only restrained
from injuring her by the immediate inter
ference of her father.
All of the facts of the unusual case de
veloped yesterday during the hearing of a
motion in Judge Seawell's court for an
order to compel young Moraghan to pay
his wife alimony pending the disposition
of Mrs. Morasrhan's action for divorce.
Mrs. Moraghan's complaint was first pro
duced and read for the Instruction of the
court. In this complaint Mrs. Moraghan
alleges that her husband "most continu
ously came home drunk, Insulted her,
called her vile names and indulged in
epithets unfit for repetition."
i He charges that she cast her baDy
daughter trom her br.-aet when her eyea
nrst opened to the light, rihe charges that
as she lay stricken with her pamyne stole
her babe away. He ;isserts that before
he married the young woman, he, for hid
own protection, secured lrom her a writ
ten waiver of ah Ciitlxu upon ins share In
the estate of his deceased mother, Julia
A. Moraghan. She, in answer, asserts
that he coerced her into signing the docu
ment. He charges that ner lather, ac
companied by a detective, by threats and
Intimidation, frightened him into surren
dering his wife's \vai\er of property right
in his estate. She avers that by dures?
he forced her to sign che document, but
later, when he saw nor suffering, he re
lented and righted the wrong he had done
her by destroying the document in her
presence with nls <Â«wn hands. He charges
ihat Ins present predrc&xsent is due to a
conspiracy between James Fay and the
woman Fay divorced ten years ago, to de
fraud him of his inteiebt in his mother's
estate, through the instrumentality of
their dausht.tr. who is now his wife. She
enters emphatic denial to this allegation
and points to his freyuent expressions of
regard for her. He lays the blame for
their separation upon her divorced pa
rents, but in answer t=lie claims that the
only objection they nave to him is re
sultant from his "drunken, boisterous
and dissipated habits." He makes the
final charge that her mother, separated
from her father, is not a lit ant' proper
person for his wife to associate v | h, but
Mrs. Moraghan retaliates with the'claim
thai her husband's h;ibit of indulging in
expressions unfit for Â» Jblication makes
him a being too unholy for her associa
tion and too dangerous to live with.
Their first meeting -cok place a little
more than a year ago, and their marriage
was solemnized October 10. 1500. Soon
thereafter a baby girl came into their
lives, not to give them comfort but to till
still fuller their cup of bitterness. After
eight weeks of married life they were
joined, not in happiness, but as plaintiff
and defendant in the divorce court. Each
has a story replete with dramatic incident
to tell and me criminations of one are
answered by the recriminations of tho
other.
It is a strange story that Is revealed by
the records of the divorce court in the
case of Moraghan vs. Moraghanâ a story
of terribly dramatic episodes in the brief
honeymoon of James 1$. and Mary Gwen
dolen Moraghan. He Is the son of the
founder of the Moraghan Oyster Com
pany, born to wealth and affluence; she
is the daughter of Policeman Fay, who is
