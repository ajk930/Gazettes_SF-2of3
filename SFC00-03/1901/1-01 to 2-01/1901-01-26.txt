MEMORIAL SEBVIOE
r Â¦: -Â£U ' FOR QUEEN VICTORIA
MULKEY. a' prepossessing
womanrfatany shot herself
.^fTy.\ yesterday afternoon in the Royal
,^""^ House v 126 Ellis street, and later
*- : "-- '' passed away irf the McNutt Hos
pital. The 'shooting is said, to have been
an accident, tut .everything points to the '
fact that the girl committed suicide.
â¢ Miss Mulkey came here with her mother
last Monday and they registered at the ,
Royal House under the name of Mr3. Mill- ;
sap and daughter. .They are residents of
Tacoma. Wash., and. came to this city to
attend to some business- connected with
Nome mining claims. E. E. Rosllng. an
attorney of Tacoma. a friend and counsel
for the women, arrived in this city a day
previous to the coming of the mother and
daughter and. he engaged rooms for them
at the .Royal House.
Mr. Rosllng said that he had called on'
the' A mother, and daughter shortly before
noon yesterday and made a report that
was' not -satisfactory. -The daughter^was
hysterical, and neither the mother nor
the attorney could pacify her. Rosllng
finally' left and returned in the afternoon.
Miss Mulkey was still laboring under
mental excitement and they again tried
to .calm her. " The young woman was too
wrought, up, however, and wildly begged,
them to leave her In peace. Her mother
and Mr. Rosllng-then left the room and
had. hardly gone one hundred feet when j
they heard; ft) pistol report. Both hurried
back to th& apartment, and they found
the young woman lying on the floor In a
pool of blood and a pistol by her side.
' Dr. A. D.. McLean, whose offices were
close by, was hurriedly "sent for and he
did all he could xo stanch the flow of
blood. . He found that ths bullet had en
tered the right breast and passed through
her body. The girl was sent In an ambu
lance to the McNutt Hospital, but died
shortly" after her arrival there.
Mrs. â¢ Mulkey was terribly shocked by
her daughter's rash deed. She can only
account for the tragedy by saying that her
daughter was In a ; hysterical mood and
shot' "herself accidentally. She said her
daughter was a lovable Â£irl and ambitious.
She had been to Nome and had secured a
number of mining claims, which she hoped
would make her independently rich and
she would be able to pursue a course of
study at college. Mrs. Mulkey said that
the pistol used by her daughter had re
posed under her pillow the night before.
They' had been in the habit of carrying
the revolver for protection. On Thursday
night, she said, her daughter had, taken
the weapon from its place of hiding and '
cleaned It.' During the cleaning process
her daughter had handled the pistol with
out fear and with such a disregard for
her safety, that she (the mother) had
tegged her to desist or she would leave
the room. She knew her daughter was
hysterical and that'. she. had received un- \
welcome news about .the business she had
come to this 'city to transact, but she did
not think if was sufficient to cause her, to
take her life!
Mr. Rosllng stated that he was in this
city, on a' pleasure trip with his wlfei and
that while' here was attending to litigation
over the. claims owned /" by the young
woman! :He Intended leaving for Tacoma
last Â¦Â¦ evening, I but : has changed his plans
and will. remain. here until after the In
quest. He said that his clients had come
and * registered -under - the name ; of Mill
sap, which " was .Mrs. : Mulkey's maiden
name,-; to prevent; certain people knowing
of their presence in this city.'- He declined
to state what the, nature of the litigation
was and advised Mrs. Mulkey, not to dis
cuss the matter." '-'' '
., The body was taken to the Morgue. The
Mrs. Mulkey is a sister of former Sena
tor Dolph of Oregon. Eleven years ago.
through Senator Dolph's Influence. Mr.
Mulkey was appointed an inspector of
customs and stationed here. He assisted
in running several bands of smugglers to
earth, but in 1S34 was arrested and
charged with being implicated with the
so-called Lotan gang of Portland and
Astoria in customs frauds. He was con
victed and sentenced to prison. Power
ful influence was brought to. bear in hi*
behalf, with the result that he was par
doned by President McKlnley about three
years ago. He then went to Boundary
Creek, a mining di3trict in British Colum
bia, and later to Dawson. where he has
made some money at mining. He cam*
out this summer, returning just before
navigation closed. Mrs. Mulkey received
letters from him only a few days bÂ«fore
leaving for San Francisco.

of the best known lawyers In Tacoma.
having formerly been a member and presi
dent of the School Board. Tacoma friends
of the Mulkeys did not know that they
were interested in any litigation calling
them to San Francisco.
Susie Mulkey was 20 years old. She
graduated from the Tacoma High School
in June. 1898, and for a ttmÂ» thereafter
was High School librarian. Later she
fitted herself to be a stenographer and in
June last went to Cape Nome to accept a
position as stenographer there. She re
ceived a good salary and saved a Iargs
part of, it. with which she hoped later
to continue her education In California, or
in the East.
TACOMA. Jan. 23.â Not enough can bÂ«
learned hereto clear up the mystery sur
rounding the suicide of Susan Mulkey la
San Francisco to-day. The friends of the
dead girl and her mother here do not
know why they went to California. Two
weeks ago a little girl living in the same
hcuse at 514 North G street became sick
and it was feared she had scarlatina.
When the question of quarantining the
house was raised Mrs. Mulkey made an
urgent request that the quarantine be not
established until she and her daughter got
away. She said they had urgent business
in Portland and must leave immediately.
They departed for Portland about ten
days ago. Their friends here were greatly
surprised to learn to-night that they reg
istered at San Francisco under another
name. They think the object was to pre
vent any knowledge of their business in
San Francisco from reaching here.

Several days ago she told OfScer Hubbard
that the man decamped on Saturday last,
taking with him several hundred dollars
belonging to her. leaving her almost pen
niless. She Intimated that she was con

Edna Gray is said by the police to have
been 28 years old a native of San
Francisco. Her real name was Lena Ful

man named Mareno, who recently com
mitted suicide. The police say that the
woman's relatives have believed her to
be dead for several years.
father of the young woman Is well known
In Washington an'd Oregon. He was Im
mediately notified of his daughter's un
timely death.
A pitiful scene was witnessed when, Mr.
Kelly, the dead girl's uncle, was called
from the' Lick House to the place where
his niece had killed herself.' He cried bit
terly and had to. be led from, the room.
When he became calmer he said he knew
of no reason j why j his niece j should j have

Mrs. Ryan saia. that Miss O'Brien was
despondent and was crying on the street.
They returned j to the house - and Miss
O'Brien went, to her bedroom, while: Mr.
and Mrs. Ryan retired to rest. A few
minutes after they retired Mn and -Mrs.
Ryan heard a muffled sound. Mrs. Ryan
thought that the bed of Miss O'Brien had
given way and asked her husband to see
if the young lady wanted any help. He
knocked at her bedroom door and, receiv
ing* no -response, opened the door,, but
found the room empty. Walking to the
rear of the flat he opened the dining-room
door Â¦ adjoining . the kitchen and /was
shocked to see the body of Miss O'Brien
stretched on the ; floor . in death., Mr.
Ryan's revolver lay by her side and a ter
rible wou/id over the heart told the man
ner of her death. â¢
Miss O'Brim was the favorite .niece of
D. Kelly, a mining man of Sonora, who is
at present stopping at the Lick House.
He defrayed all her 'expenses and since
his arrival in San' Francisco has* been
most assiduous In caring for the. young
woman. Last Â¦ evening he called at the
house where she was staying and took her
to fllnner at a downtown destaurant. She
seemed In bright spirits during the meal
and bade her uncle an affectionate good
night when he took her home.' He did
not see her again until he her
body cold in d.eath in ,the room where she
ended her life.
That the young woman premeditated self
destruction is shown by. the statements of
Mr. and Mrs. Ryan, with whom she lived.
Mr. Ryan, who is an employe of the San
Francisco .Gas Company, said last night
that he was the owner of the revolver
with which Miss, O'Brien shot herself. He
kept It in ' a bureau drawer in his bed
room and had not used It for. many
months. Last evening after Miss O'Brien
returned home she went for a short walk

Edward VII. who will be amply pro
vided for by the country, and tne.Duka
of York, who comes into the Duchy of
Cornwall and will. be the Prince of Wales,
will probably not be sharers In the laid
Queen's private fortune.
Estimates made b'v the best Informed
persons in the financial field fix the valuo
of Queen Victoria's private estate at
something between $50,000,000 and $60,000,000.
Parliament., uppn ,her. accession, granted
her' $1,250 ,000. a,' year.. That sum, It was
estimated, would- maintain the royal es
tablishment and leave the sovereign $300.
000 f cr pocket money or personal expenses.
Since the death of Albert, the Prince
Consort, It Is asserted her Majesty ha 1 *
saved $250,000 a year of. that sum. Th'.s
money, together with Its Increment, has
been Invested under '.he best advice that
London, the financial center of the wond,
could supply: 'Added to It and accumu
lating each year. Is: the rum of $2,300,030,
the private fortune of Ihe Prince Consorl.
which was bequeathed to the Queen. She
was also the -legatee of 'many admiring
subjects, one of them deeding $2,500,000.
It Is believed that one of the last acts
cf .Queen Victoria was to signify a wish
that the testimonial sent by the children
of Canada should be handed over to the
Royal Patriotic Commissioners | for tho
benefit of the widows and orphans of sol
diers,killed; In. South Africa. This desir-i
was communicated to | the j commissioner*
in a letter 'from the Colonial Office dated
the day of -her death. The testimonial of
the children of Canada conslcted of ths
sum of Â£3399. .which Mr. Chamberlain for
warded to the Royal Fatriotlc Commis
sioners the day Queen Victoria died.

It is known that }he Queen made a will
early In her reign, which was repeatedly -
altered" and_ added to as children and
grandchildren were borr* end as her es
tates rapidly in value. This
proceeded until 1596, when her Majesty
decided to have an entirely new documen'
drawn, and with f?r eat personal care this
was accomplished."
Those in a position to make any sorr
of a guess as to the provisions of the
Queen's will declare that Princess Beat

berg, will be . the principal beneficiary -
She. Is the Governor cf the Isle of Wight
and will probably* Inherit Osborne House
and the whole, estate surrounding it. Then
the Duke' of Connaught and his sons, who
have been great favorites with Victoria,
will, receive a large portion of he for

the owner of Balmoral and the Scottish
property.
Grandchildren who are expected to.re

children of .Victoria's youngest son. the

houses. It was as follows:
"Edward, Rexâ The Kine is fully as
sured that the House of Commons will
share the deep sorrow which has befallen
his Majesty and the nation by the lament
able death of his mother, the late Queen.
Her devotion to the welfare of her coun
try and her people and her wise ' and
beneficent rule during the sixty-four years
of her glorious' reign will ever be held In
affectionate memory by her loyal and de
voted subjects throughout the dominions
of the British empire."
In both houses the' galleries were filled
i with a notable gathering of peeresses and
j diplomats. Mr. Choate. United States Em- ;
bassador; .Mr. White, secretary of the"
.United States omliassy, and x-T. Chester.
the^second secretary, and-thelr wives were :
in the galleries of the House -of .Lords.. \
Lord Salisbury moved the reply to the
King's mespage'in a speech full of emo-'
tion. He said that In performing the sad
dest duty that had ever fallen -to him he.
was only echoing accents of sorrow deeper,
than he had ever known of' this nation,'
which had been called forth by the singu
lar loss which, under the dispensation of
Providence, they had suffered, and their,
admiration of the glorious .reign and
splendid character* of the sovereign they
had lost. Being a constitutional monarch,
with restricted powers, she had reigned
not by sheer force of character, but by.
the lovablcness of her disposition and by
her hold on the hearts of her subjects.
The example which she set of governing
by love and esteem would never be forgot
ten, nor how much she assisted In the
elevation of her people by the simple con
templation of her brilliant qualities as a
wife, mother and woman. Her wonderful
ability of observing with absolute strict-:,
ness the. limits of her powers as a consti
tutional sovereign and at the same time
maintaining steady and persistent influ
ence over the actions of her Ministers In
spired the greatest admiration. She al
ways maintained a rigorous supervision
over public affairs, giving her Ministers
the benefit of her advice and warning
them of danger*. No Minister could d!s- i
regard her views or press her to disregard
them without feeling he had Incurred a
great danger. She brought the country
peacefully through a great change-from
old to new England. She possessed ex- '
traordinary knowledge of what people
think.
In the House of Commons A. J. Balfour,
First Lord of the Treasury and Govern
ment leader, In moving the address In re
ply to the message, said the House in all
Its history had never met under sadder
circumstances or with a clearer duty to
express the universal \ sorrow extending
f-om end to end of the empire. The sor
row was felt not only as a national, but
an Irreparable personal loss. It was hard
yet to realize the magnitude of the blow
which had fallen on the country- In the
whole history of the British monarchy
there had never been a case in which the
national grief had been so deeply Eeated.
In moving a double response of condol
ence and congratulation Mr. Balfour said
they had unfailing confidence that the
great Interests committed to the new sov
ereign were safe in his keeping.

bold servants, anfi in the presence of the j
King, the Err.peror and the Duke, re- 1
moved the body from the bed to the coffin.
In death it was lovelier than in the

ravages of disease was visible. The serv^
ants having retired. Queen Alexandra, the
Princess and the children were recalled,
and with lingering steps and stifled sobs
they passed f lowly before the white robed
nr.d peaceful figure. At the foot, never
moving, stood the King, and when the
mourning crowd had passed- there re
mained only the son and the grandson of
th* dead.
Err.peror William wept even more bit
terly than the* royal ladle*. â¢ Finally he
also retired and the King was left alone.

ants, who were 'holding the coffin lid. ask

For a few ' seconds '. the King stood
Â¦epÂ«Â»echless. -etricken with emotion at the
last farewell.. Then he said .quickly:
'â¢Close It finally. It must not be opened
eg-ain."
Thus the remains of England's greatest
rul<Â°r were forever closed from human
view. Reverently , the coffin was borne
into the dining-room. Officers and men
fr^m ' the royal yachts took their stand
around the coffin, over which the King,
Queen and Kaiser gently laid the robes
of a Knight of the Garter, placing at the
head a diamond crown. Beneath lay the
royal ensign, while hanging above was the
union Jack.
At the altar was the rector of Whip
p!rgham, who read a portion of the fu
neral service In the presence of the royal
fain!!}*. Emperor William covered his
fare with his hands and the grief of Prin
cess Beatrice was pitiful. After the bene
diction each placed a 'wreath upon the
coffin and then all retired.
According to a rumor circulating at Os
borne. King Edward desires himself to be
styled "his Imperial Majesty." in order
to emphasize the face that he Is Emperor
as well as King.

Marshal Bennett returned from Eufaula
this morning after a visit with five depu
ties to the home of Chief Snake. "When' he
first entered Snake's house there were but
three people there. In less than twenty
minutes' time forty .light horsemen, In
dians of Snake's" band, gathered. They
were all heavily' armed, but offered no
bodily harm to the officers. The Indians
had been picketed round about, evidently,
to protect their chief or to give warning
of an attack. Snake was not to be found
and Bennett left word for. him to come to
MUskogee or Eufaula for a conference.
A Muskogee. I. T.. special says: The
Creek uprising continues dangerous,
troops having as yet failed to arrive.
United States Marshal Bennett has cap
tured the 17-year-old son of Chief Snake,
and has notified the latter that the boy
would be held as a hostage until the In
dians surrendered. The Indians have so
far refused to surrender, and* to-day are
holding two councils, near Brlstow and
Rush Hill. A dispatch from Bristow this
morning states that the threatened attack
on that town had not yet begun, but that
the citizens were continuing to arm them
selves and prepare for an emergency.
Marshal Bennett expresses fear of blood
shed If the troops ordered from Fort Reno
do not arrive soon. They were expected
this morning.
At 1 o'clock the Governor held a con
sultation over the, telephone with Colonel
Hoffman and Sheriff THghman at Chand
ler, and 'they stated that many 1 depreda
tions were being committed over the line
in the Creek reservation, both by the In
dians and by outlaws, but that up to that
time nobody had crossed the line and
there was no positive evidence of any in
tention to cross or to commit any overt
acts on this side of the line. The Governor
advised that a close watch be kept along
the line and advice sent him of any overt
act against citizens or property in Okla
homa, but that until there was some at
tempt to cross the line or commit some
such act he should not feel that he would
bo justified In ordering the National
Guard to the scene.

. TACOMA, Jan. 25.â Unattended by the
little consolation that might have been of
fered to a man about to be hurled into
eternity at the end of the rope, Martin
Stickel marched upon the scaffold and
met his doom at 9:55 o'clock this morning
at Kahuna. The hanging was successful
in that the murderer was 'killed almost
Instantly, but the drop was too far, and
the result was that the flesh of^ his neck
was horribly torn. The hanging was wit
nessed by 200 persons. Among them were
a number' of physicians.
When the trap was sprung the body
shot down through the opening and when
'it stopped with a jerk, blood spurted from
the neck. ' Even the physicians present
were appalled and hesitated when it came
time to step forward to note the pulse
of the swinging man. Stickel did not
struggle in /the least. His neck was
broken.
True to his promise made a few weeks
ago to Sheriff Klrby, Stickel marched to
the gallows like a brave man. He walked
steadily to the scaffold, supported by the
Sheriff's deputies. Â¦ He sat unmoved and
with arms folded while Sheriff Hunting
ton read the death warrant. As the mur
derer was escorted to the platform a mur
mur .of surprise ran through the crowd.
Tnere was no minister, nor priest, nor
other person accompanying him to offer
religious consolation in j his hour of ex
tremity. This was the more surprising
since the man's confession had been ob
tained after he professed to have been
converted while in jail in Tacoma through
the work of members of the Salvation
Army. On the scaffold Stickel weakened
a little and his face became livid. In a
shaking voice and somewhat Incoherently
he said: . ;
"Gentlemenâ I wish you all good-by. I
will meet you on the other shore. God
bless all of you." Â¦ V
A brief pause followed while the final
adjustments were being made about the
scaffold: then ;Stlckal continued: "God
help me." As he weakly uttered these
words the black cap was quickly adjust
ed and all was ready,
a much stronger and steadier voice
and in the form of a wild, pitiful appeal,
Stickel eatd: "Jesus, take me now." At
that ' instant the trap - was sprung. The
drop was fully seven and one half feet.
The murderer's body was turned over to
the mother.
Martin Stickel Â¦ confessed that he ; mur
dered -three persons. His victims were
William B. Shanklin, who lived on a farm
near Kelso, and Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius
Knapp, an*agm couple, living near. Castle
Rock. \ V
' Shanklin was shot while eating supper
some. time in November, 1899; and nls body
was cremated in: the house, which was
burned, to; the ground by. the. murderer.

SEATTLE. Jan. 25. â On. tho shore of
Lake "Washington, four miles from the.
heart of Seattle, lies the body of a well
dressed man with a large knife sticking
in his throat. Who the man is and where
he came from is yet a mystery to tho
police. Acting Chief of Police Meredith
did not conceal his belief that the strang
er had been, foully dealt with. Owing to
a peculiar combination of circumstances,
neither the Coroner's office nor the police
were able to get to work on the case until

the body they" became lost in the woods
and darkness came on before they com
pleted their mission. Two boys who first
discovered the body and were sent out
with the searching party, became per
plexed as to the direction in the dark
ness and finally gave up the task.
The story told by the boys to the police
is generally credited among the/detec

morning sensational details will come to
light. The boys said they were out in

The boys fled from the spot as soon as
they could recover from their fright.

had been dead for some time, as there
was a bleached appearance about the
face, indicating exposure to the elements.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.â Chief of Police
Sullivan this morning received from Cap
tain Seymour of San Francisco a circular
letter describing a lot of Jewelry recently
stolen from a store there. Detectives
Fisher and Fitzgerald of this city were
handed the circular. They learned that a
well-dressed young man had visited an up
town Jewelry store and exhibited a ring
set with several pure white diamonds.
This afternoon the detectives found in a
downtown variety theater a man answer
ing tho description of the ring wearer. He
was taken to the police station,- where his
clothes panned out a half-dozen fine dia
mond rings aggregating In value $600.
The young man gave his name as James
Mitchell, alias Charles Wilson, alias Ma
sury. He admitted to the detectives that
he had stolen the jewels from a room In a
hotel' in San Francisco, and that other
jewelry which was among the plunder
was disposed of in that city. The
prisoner said that Masury was his true
name and that ho hailed from Boston. He
will be taken to San Francisco to-morrow.
Mr3. Julia Lincoln, who gives her resi
dence an the Leepalmer House, on Mason
street, reported to Captain Seymour that
she had been robbed of a box containing
jewelry amounting to more than $1000.
According to her story some one entered
her apartments while she was in the bath
room, and finding where her Jewels were
kept got out of the house before the alarm
could be given. ' V
Soon after tho loss Mrs. Lincoln learned
of the hasty departure of William Mon
tieth, a young man living in the house,
and suspicion was directed to him. It was
found that Montleth had gone to Sacra
mento, and Mrs. Lincoln accordingly
swore out a warrant for his arrest. Cap
tain Seymour took the precaution to have
the man detained in the capital city,

tary tangle as could be imarined is now
tying up the Joint rules of th<* Legislature
and making it likely that joint relation*
will not be established at all this ses-
Pion. It is over joint rule 23, which refers
to free conference committees.
" The original rule adopted by the joint
Committee on Rules was that when a free
conference committee failed to agrei
upon a bill from one house that had been
amended in the other that would end the
matter and kill the bill; but the Assembly
refused to adopt this rule, preferring that
free conference committees could be ap
pointed without number should they fall
to asree.
The Senate refused to recede from its
position and so did the Assembly, and a
conference committee was appointed.
The conference committee compromised
and submitted a rule providing- that, Â«f
the free conference committee could no:
agree, "final free conference" committo
be appointed, in which a disagreement
would be final. The Senate adopted this
rule, but the Assembly remained rirm, and
now the rule has zone to itself, so to
speak, for a free conference committee,
consisting of 'Senators Leavitt. Cutter
and Greenwell and Assemblymen Brown
of San Mateo. Melick and James, has
been appointed to consider It.
The free conference committee met this
afternoon and. as was expected, there was
a deadlock. The committeemen from the
Senate refused to give an inch and the
Assemblymen stood just as firmly. The
Senators declare now that it is thÂ« As
sembly's move and thev are satisfied Â¦with
the present condition of affairs.
The trouble with the situation is that
both houses may get obstinate and may
amend the bills from the other side. In
the absence of conference -and free con
ference committees this will be a danger
ous proceeding and will result in the pre
mature death of a great many measures.

the Assc-robly is still a matter of
the future and a -fiasco to-day in
the attempt of the San Francisco delega
tion to outwit the country members who
â¢were standing with them makes still less
the probability of the scheme being car
ried out.
Brown of San Francisco, chairman of
the Committee on Attaches, offered a res
olution this morning providing for the ap
pointment of Jacob Steppacher as 'â¢ap
portionment clerk" to the San Francisco
delegation. Brown was not able to ex
plain the resolution, but Guilfoyle made
tui attempt to^do so that was not at all
satisfactory. When the voting began
many Republicans considered themselves
free to vote in the negative, as the cau
cus agreement was that Steppacher was
to be simply "apportior.meni clerk" and
not an attache oi the San Francisco dele
gation. Johnson and others took occasion
lo rebuke the greed of the budding states
rmn from San Francisco and the resolu
tion .was lost.
Guilfoyle tried to withdraw it. but the
Speaker announced it lost, and Johnson

ADVERTISEMENTS.
HAVE YOU ANY OF THESE
Symptoms of a Very Common
Trouble P
There is no disease so common In tho
United States as catarrh because tt ap-
pears in so many forms and attacks so
many different organs.
It is a common mistake to suppose that
catarrh is confined to the nose and throat.
Any inflammation of the mucous mem-
brane wherever located accompanied by
abnormal secretions is catarrh. Catarrh
of stomach or bladder, or . intestines is
nearly as common as nasal catarrh and
much more serious, although it is trua
that stomach catarrh and catarrh of oth-
er internal organs is the result of neg-
lected nasal catarrh.
A new remedy has recently appeared
which so far as tested seems to be re-
markably effective in promptly curing ca-
tarrh, wherever located. The preparation
is sold by druggists generally under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and in addi-
, tlon to being very palatable and conveni-
ent, possesses . extraordinary merit, in
many cases giving immediate relief from
the coughing, hawking and constant
clearing of the throat and head, those
symptoms with which everyone is famil-
iar who has ever suffered from, colds in
the head and throat.
Catarrh is simply a continuation or
these symptoms until the trouble becomes
chronic and grows gradually worse from
year to year.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
of Hydrastln. Eucalyptol. Gualacol and
similar antiseptics and catarrh specifics.
from which it will be seen, that no secret
is made of the ingredients and also that
no mineral poisons axe used, as Is the
case with many well-known catarrh med-
icines. ?' V f
For catarrh of the nose, throat, bron- 1 .
chlal tubes, for catarrh of stomach, in-
testines or bladder no preparation 13 so
safe and gives such rapid and permanent
results as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
All druggists sell them at oOc for full
sized package. You can use them witn
assurance that you will not contract thÂ»
cocaine or morphine habit as the results
from this catarrh cur* are apparent from,
the first day's use. ,

DENVER, Jan. 2o.-The rich strike in
the tunnel of the Oil Creek Mining Com
pany under Pikes Peak has caused a rush
of prospectors to that region already. The
strike is close to the populous town of
Colorado Springs, within easy range of
the comforts of civilization, and pros
pectors will encounter few of the disad
vantages such as beset the gold seekers
In the more desolate parts of the Rockies.
A large number of miners have gone to
lhÂ« scene already, although the announce
ment of the strike was made only yester
day morning. Investigation to-day shows
that the ore uncovered by the Oil Creek
Company runs J-JOO to the ton instead of
JSO, as was given out. Not a share of the
stock is for sale. All of it is owned by ten
or twelve Cincinnati capitalists. Tho
miners of the company were kept In Ignor
ance of the richness of the find until the
company's agent had secured 275 acres of
adjacent claims for $30,000.
Incoming prospectors are pitching their
tents in the vicinity of the tunnel and
many claims were staked off yesterday.
It Is expected within a short time If any
other strikes are made that a new camp
will be formed. It is strange that this
should be the first extremely rich strike
on Pikes Peak.

TfÂ«^OME, Jan. 26.â A special dispatch
II )l to the Patria announces that
lo^ Verdi, the composer, is dead.
Gluseppl Verdi, the composer,
sprang from very humble parentage, his
father being a peasant ln^the little hamlet
of Roncale, near Busseto, Dutchy of Par
ma. Italy, where Verdi was born, October
9, 1814. Â¦ He early showed a passionate love
for music and his first musical education
was obtained from the organist of the vil-.
lage church at . Roncole, a position to
which Verdi himself succeeded when only
ten years Old. He attracted the attention
of an enthusiastic amateur musician, who
sent him to Milan, where, from 1S33 to 1836,
he studied under . Lavigna, head of the
Scala Theater. .
Verdi's first opera was "Obertp, Conte dl
San Bonifacio," produced In Milan, No
vember 17, 1839. Since then he has com
posed about twenty-six operas, the best
known of. which are: Â¦ . â¢ . â -
"II Trovatore',"" "Ca Travlata. TUgo
letto," "Un Ballo in Maschera,' "'Aida,'
."Otello" and "Falstaff" (1803).
One large work for the church should
also be mentionedâ the "Grand Requiem
Mass." A large number of hl3 works have
been received with enthusiasm in all civil
ized lands. An additional proof of his tal
ent is the fact that the quality of his work
did not fall off during the long period of
his professional activity, but kept pace
with the great changes which have
affected the dramatic stage since his
youth. J Â¦ '_'" \ jf

Duchess of Manchester left for the north
In their private car at noon. v \Vlth them
went their guest, Lord Lambert. . In the
car there Is an Improvised gymnasium
annex, and here The Call correspondent
found the Duke this morning.
"I haven't punched the bag for a week
and I'm getting stiff," said Manchester.
"You know, I was the champion pugilist
at school. I knocked out twenty-eight
out of thirty-eight mÂ«n. Not bad, eh?
Now then. John."
The DuKe's valet had by this time fas
tened a punching bag to the rear end of
the car and the broad-shouldered young
representative of the House of Montague
flew at the bag with a vim. After a while
he stopped to rest.
"My name is William Angus Drogo," he
said. "My wife calls me Willie, but I
don't quite fancy that. You might call
me Bill."
Then the bag punching was resumed un
til a young woman's pretty, smiling face
showed at the car door. ' When she saw
the reporter's camera she vanished.
The Duke and Duchess and Lord Lam
bert afterward proceeded to the front of
the depot. While debating whether or
not they would have time to take a street
car ride, tha warning bell rang and they
hurried back to their special car. Many
curious sightseers were at the station to
see the ducal party off and the last
glimpse of the departing train showed the
travelers on the rear platform, wav
ing handkerchiefs in farewell.
There is reason to believe that Papa
Zimmerman. In Cincinnati, has pulled the
pursestrlngs. The party intended going
to Monterey and enjoy the pleasures of
the Del Monte golf links. Del Monte has
been cut out and the private car of the
president of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and
Dayton Railway is routed through to the
East via San Francisco.
Before his departure the Duke gave out
a signed statement. In part as follows:
"We planned at first to remain In thÂ©
vicinity of Los Angeles for a fortnight.
Lord Lambert and I are enthusiastic golf
ers and we hoped to try conclusions with
some of the enthusiasts of your splendid
links. Since our western tour began,
however, our plans have been changed,
for personal reasons, and now we are
hurrying back East, by way of San Fran

"My object In smashing saloons," con
tinued Mrs. Nation, "is to stiffen the
backbone of the women against the rum

Mrs. Nation talked for an hour, reciting
the story of her experiences during the

continue the business of breaking Joints

The shooters of ducks have been the ob

Another event that is interesting the ex

which will be played Wednesday after
noon. The management of this tourna
ment is In the hands of Miss Hunter and
R. N. Whitney, and as all the crack play
ers have expressed their Intention of en
tering It-will undoubtedly be an interest-
Ing affair. Partners will be drawn by lot,
and thus everybody will have equal
chancesifor the prizes. Among the lady
experts who will play are the Misses Hall:
Hunter. Dcnson. Bowman, McCartney and
Haslett.
Tennis players of the. University of Cal
ifornia and Stanford are practicing con
stantly 1 . The former,- Including Hunt, D.
McGavin and Selby. are seen frequently
at the California courts and are all in fine
form. The Stanford men â Weihe. Adams,
Roth and Misnerâ do most of their playing
on the college courts and are fast round
ing into form. Welhe and Adams are ! a
very strong double team, and Misner, an
Eastern crack, gives promise of becoming
a first-class player before the" season Is
over. With Sam Hardy out of the game
it looks to be a toss-up as to who will win
the Intercollegiate tennis this year. -â¢â¢
The pleasant weather, of the past week
brought out most of the cracks, and as a
result many close matches were played.

Should G. F. Whitney and the Hardys

SAN DIEGO. Jan. 25.â Two resignations
have to some extent disturbed the placid
ity of baseball circles In San DleKo. Mon
day's game was characterized by entirely
too much kicking to please the audience
and the management. The kicking was
directed principally at the umpire and
came from both teams, Donlln of San
Dieso belnp the leader among: the San
Dlepos and Kelley among the 8an Beraar
dlnos. It was entirely too roujrh for Um
pire Sylvester, and on the day following
the jrame he Informed Manager Carey of
the San Diegos that his money was not
(rood enouph to make him stand tRe abusn
he received at the hands, or rather at the
mouths, of the players.
Donlin has been the captain of the San
Dle?o team, but as he was severely criti
cized for his kicking, both by the people
who patronize the same and by the news
papers,* he told the management that some
onÂ» else should be allowed to captain the
team, since the people did hot seem to Ilka
his style.
Both resignations have been accepted.
Bill DeveTeaux. the captain of last year's
Sacramento team, was appointed by Man
ager Carey as cat)tain.|rind Charles Van
Horn, who played with the locals hefors
the team was professionalized, will act aa
umpire.
As most of the kicking has been on balJa
and strikes. Manager Carev has asked the
leapue management for the privilege of
having an umpire at the plate to decide
on balls and strikes. Ex-Assemblyman
Lewis Works, who is one of the big ball
cranks of this crank center, has volun
teered to officiate a.i the extra umpire
without expense to the management.

Next Friday and Saturday, February 1
and 2,- on the links of the Los Angeles
Country Club, contests -for the women's
championship '-of ... Southern California
will be played. Mrs. Jean W. Bowers of
Garvanxa at present holds the champion
ship, but judging from recent play on the
Los Angeles Country dub's links Mrs. E.
D. Silent and Mrs. Fred Griffith may press
her hard. On New Year's day Mrs. E. D.
Silent tied Mrs. J. W. Bowers with a
gross score of 102 for eighteen holes and
Airs. Fred Griffith made a score of 103.
' Though Willie Smith and David Bell
failed to make so- low a record over the
Los Angeles Country Club's course as was
hoped for, they played splendid golf.
Their drives, brassie. iron and approach
shots were almost perfect, but the vary
ing surface of the oiled sand putting
grounds puzzled them and made them lose
confidence. Smith savs that the game of
the Los Angeles golfers is far beyonil
what he had expected to find in Califor
nia and that many of the players compare
favorably with Eastern golfer^ and could
hold their own in any amateur company
in the United States with the exception
of Travis. Douelas. Harriman and Wat
son. David Bell commented on .the ten
dency of gome of the southern golfers to
run up with iron clubs, which is not rood
eolf. and not to pick the ball up cleanlv..
He thinks 'that the running-up approach
should be punished. .;-
Despite the rain last Sunday several
matches were olayed on the Presidio links.
J. W. 'Byrne beating H. C. Oolchar 7 up

JUMPERS TAKING THE FIRST OBSTACLE
AT TANFORAN, AND A FEW SIDE LIGHTS
Thf re ie no doubt In the world that
Terry McGovern was the altar on which
all local prizefight promoters were pre
pared to sacrifice themselves. But It now
Feems as if the Twentieth Century Ath
letic Club has won the race, s*-curing the
fistic wonder of the last of the old and the
beginning; of the new century.
In a letter from Jim Kennedy, the offi
cial matchmaker, to Jack Gleason, the
president of the Twentieth Century Ath
letic Club, the former writes that he has
secured the signature of McGovern*s man
eger for a fight between the champion
feather-weight and some other pugilist
not yet nominated, the fight to take place
on April SO before the Twentieth Century
Club. These facts were corroborated later
In the week by a letter sent to Ned Ho
man by Harris. McGovern's manger. Ho
man was out for McGovern with an $8000
purse offer and he burned the wires for
many days in his unsuccessful attempts
to secure the fighter of all fighters. In
this letter to Homan Harris admits the
contract with Kennedy, acting in the
name of the Twentieth Century Club.
What the terras of the agreement signed
by Harris and Kennedy are is not defi
nitely known. Without question they
favor McGovern. for no streee, financial
or pugilistic, is upon him at present. When
it comes to the matchmaking the choice
will be left to McGovern whom he will or
whom he will not meet.
Ned Homan had but one match in mind,
thct with Frank Erne. He thought that
McGovern should allow Erne to fight at
133 pounds, and if a match could be fixed
at those weights and between those men
he would deposit $SO00 purse money with
any reliable party suggested. Homan re
ceived many telegraphic nromises from
Hcrris. but none of any positive nature.
It muÂ« be that Jim Kennedy's offer was
easier and more to the liking of Harris
and McGovern.
There is pome real desire on the part of
Harris to fight McGovern in this city late
in April or early in May. Terry's theatri
cal venture has been a profitable one, but
in order to keep the edge of business ever
6harp Terry must be ever before the pub
lic as a prizefighter. Prizefight managers
with a money-maker like McGovern are
always looking for something of an easy
order, the good-thing variety. It Is in
cumbent upon the Twentieth Century
Club to match McGovern with a good,
strong man. one who will give him some
kind of a ruh and the public a clean,
strong exhibition.
The February date is held by the Twen
tieth Century Club, which has at last
fixed its card. George McFadden and Dai
Hawkins â¢wilj be one of the tights. They
have agreed to fight at 133 pounds. Haw
kins has been pitting the loser's purse
quite frequently in his late career, so Mc-
Fadden will step into the ring a pro
nounced favorite. MeFadden is In the
T.p.rt at present, but will leave for San
Francisco !n a very short time.
Crlbb and Thurston are furnishing mat
ter for pugilistic gossip even at this late
day. They hold the local firmament and
are much sought after by every club in
the field. These two men will undoubtedly
fight again. Whether it will be this month
or next Is the question. The Twentieth
Century Club would like the match, but
the National Ck!b will probably get them
Jeffries and Sharkey and Ruhlln and
Mfther, Tom O'Rourke and his string and
ail the smaller fry are turning eyes to

If I were consulted in the matter I would suggest that all bookxnaking be prohibited and the
gamblers forced to the extremity of making handbooks. This would remove the temptation to those who
do not know the game and confine gambling to those who do. The statement that I have been in consul
tation with Supervisors looking to the adoption of an ordinance which will permit a limited local sea
son, of racetrack gambling is not a fact. I have not been consulted in the affair, and know nothing of
what will be done or is in contemplation for Monday. The Board of Supervisors, however is an aggres
sive body. â Mayor James D. Phelan in an interview yesterday with The Call. ' : *
I cannot answer, therefore, what I will do if the legislature adopts no law and the Supervisors
of San Francisco do enact an ordinance permitting limited racing, except to say that I am in favor of it in
this city. I will not say that I will not sign such an ordinance and I will not say that I will do so. I am
simply in favor of a limited season of horse-racing in San Francisco.
'While I admit that the legislature should adopt some restrictive measure I also admit that
if it does not no ordinance adopted by the Supervisors of San Francisco, fixing a limited season here
will be effective. Unless we give the gamblers as many days' racing as their competitors in" another
county wÂ» will not accomplish the purpose I have in view.
I am convinced that this matter should receive the attention and thoughtful consideration of the
State legislature, which should limit racing in every county to thirty days, but the State legislature, as
at present organized, is not such a body as to encourage me to hope that it will do anything in the prem
ises. If Euch a restrictive law were adopted we in San Francisco could have thirty days of racing, Oak
land could have the same privilege; and also San Mateo. This would give these gamblers an equal num
ber of days in each city and an equal opportunity to pick the pockets of the same public, for the public
is the same in the three counties.
I em in favor of a limited season of horse-racing, say of thirty days, in San Francisco. I do
not believe that we should give gamblers of Oakland an opportunity f cr an exclusive privilege to pick
pockets simply because we have a moral crusade on in this city. I belie ve that we ought to permit this
racing season of thirty days in San Francisco simply as a dissipation for our people. I would therefore
approve a city ordinance providing for a limited racing season.
"I Am in Favor of a Limited Season of Horse-Racing."
Public gambling is a great evil, leading: to poverty, disgrace, defalcation and death, which the
records of the city abundantly prove, and its practice should be discountenanced and suppressed.
Excerpt from the msssage of Mayor James D. Phelan.' Delivered to the Board of Supervisors on January 8, 1900.
"Public Gambling Is a Great Evil and Should Be Suppressed'*
MAYOR PHELAN'S PECULIAR DECLARATION.
fiÂ»p|-<aHE people of this city must again
I face the menactt of an evil which
1 1 it was hoped that local leglsla-
II tlon, supported by a united presa,
pulpit and public opinion, had
crushed out of Baa Francisco. A con
spiracy more dangerous, more powerfully
orrs-nlzed than any of its predecessors is
on foot to reopen thÂ« racetrack at Incle
slSe and bring back to this city the gam
blers, touts, bookmakers and their dis
graceful rout, which wrought such incal
culable harm before.
So thoroughly has this dangerous move
ment been planned that it already pos
i^skps the Indorsement of Mayor James D.
Phelan. who declared in an interview yes
terday that he favors the reopening of
Ir.gleside racetrack for a yearly season of
thirty days, with a revival of the r-m
gllng which before brought poverty, mis
ery*, dishonor and death to so many of
the homes of Saa Francisco. It is not
likely that any other public act of Mayor
Phelan will create such astonishment aa
this announcement of his that he Is will
ing to* sign an ordinance reopening thft
racecourse.
In the agitation which reached a climax
In the closing of Inrieslde . and the de
etruction of the evil which it represented
Mayor Phelan played & most prominent
part. The pressure of public opinion, of
the prees. of the pulpit, of men of affairs
In every walk of life, of merchants, law
yers, artisans, was uaon him and when
the ordinance killing the gambling. of In
&tles!de was adopted by the Supervisors
The issue is a serious one to all who
have at heart the welfare of the city.
It Is almost Idle, to tell the story of the
crime and shame which Ingleside brought
to San Francisco., The story Is too well
known In the records of our courts and
Jails, in our Morgue, In disgraced officials,
in dishonored men of â¢ position,'. In young
men ruined at the very threshold of their
career. This story, I bo , often told. , with
chapters that j have j been . added , by some
new offense possesses a personal, dreadful
Such a remarkable chance In the posi
tion of the chief executive of the city
should be evidence conclusive of the as
se'rtlon that the people of San Francisco
must flght unitedly *Jid at once to pre
vent a recurrence of the shame and disas
ter which was before upon the city. Un
less the clergymen of this city wish to
hear again the storv of sorrow amor.p
their flock, to see homes wrecked, young
men and women dishonored, thieves made
of honorable men anil the penitentiaries
being filled they must make their protest
at once, for it is planned that .on Mon
day morning by vote of the Board of Su
pervisors Ingleside racetrack shall be re
opened. . -~'H:
Action Must Be Taken at Once.
Mayor Phelan, without leaving his seat
in the Supervisorial chamber, signed the
ordinance, bo conspicuously did he wish
to express his unqualified Indorsement of
the measure which nad become a law.
And now he says that he wants to sea
Ingleside racetrack reopened.
In order, therefore, that they may, place
in an entering 'wedge for their, return, to
the city the gamblers have decided to ask
the Supervisors . for thirty days In each
year in which they, will be licensed " by
law to rob the people. ; If they, cannot
have three months, then ; one month â¢ will
b* of vast profit;, to them. . ; . And v Mayor
Pbelan makes the remarkable announce-
In this latest attempt of the gamblers
to regain the enormously, wealthy field
In which in this city, they operated and
preyed upon^the youth of San Francisco,
an. Insidious .scheme has been. Involved.
Tne bookmakers and Eastern; crooks
know that public opinion is so violently
antagonistic to . them here that it would
be the height of folly to attempt to return
with unlimited. racing. The people of Ban
Francisco have paid too much in dishonor
and death to permit the unlimited game
again.
Unless the merchants of this city wish
to see a return of the dangers and temp
tations and varied pitfalls of the race
course return to trap new clerks, other
employes and other confidential servants
they must at once make their protest to
the Board of Supervisors, for it is planned
that on Monday an 'effort will be made In
that body to reopen the Ingleside race
track. Unless the arrangements are
changed before Monday Supervisor Tobln
will introduce- the resolution . providing
for the reopening of the track.
Mayor Phelan's Extraordinary Plea.
meaning to every one who has at stake
anything In this city.
It was stated yesterday that Mayor
Fhelan had been . consulted by. members
of the Board of Supervisors, in reference
to the proposed ordinance,; but the .Mayor
dented this, admitting, however, ; that he
Is ; in I favor of such > an '. ordinance. = ; He
says , that ; he i has heard nothing/ of ,the
projected law,' but"; feels '.confident of the
aggressiveness" of , the Supervisors, In view
of. the - prospective ) failure of. any.- legisla
tion at Sacramento.
"Public gambling ; is a great evil, lead
ing to poverty, disgrace,", defalcation and
death, which t. the :;. records Hot ; this city
abundantly, prove, and its practice should
be" discountenanced ' and suppressed.", : '
Now Indorses.
More than that,, Mayor Phelan gives an
extraordinary reason for saying that he
would like to see Ingleside racetrack re
opened for thirty, days every 'year. It is
not because he wishes to encourage horse
racing, because he says that he knows
nothing i about it; and is . not Interested.
He says . that simply because, a moral
crusade is on In San Francisco we should
not' legislate so as to give one set of ras
cals In Oakland an advantage , over an
other set in San Francisco, and, therefore;
we should permit the set in San Fran
cisco operate as well. This extraordinary
explanation it*~is hardly to be expected
will be satisfactory to the merchants,
ministers and f public-spirited citizens of
this city. Nor Is It particularly.in.har
mony with Mayor Phelan's own words In
hls-message to; the "Board of Supervisors
delivered'on January 8, 1900. Those words
were as follows: , : .

DOUBTLESS to many Americans the pompous
parade with' which the accession of Edward;
VII to the throne of Great Britain was pro
claimed at various points in the city of London seemed
but a medieval folly, a mere display of "fuss and
feathers." There was, however, much more in it than
that. Back of the show was a substance that em
bodied the liberties of the British people and marked
the difference between a constitutional King and a
Kaiser or a Czar.
The hereditary Earl Marshal of the empire, accom
panied by four kings at arms, four heralds and eight
pursuivants, all gorgeously arrayed, and attended by
an imposing escort of the Horse Guards, marched
from the palace to Temple Bar, where of old stood
the gateway of the city. There they found stretched
across the street a silken rope. That rope meant
freedom. It was a symbol of the line beyond which
neither the King nor the King's troops could go
without the consent of the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen
and the citizens of London. It was a virtual mani
festation that Edward rules not by divine right but
by the consent of his people. Not until the London
authorities had given their approval could the stately
procession of soldiers and heralds and kings at arms,
with the Marshal at their head, enter the ancient city
of London and proclaim the accession of the King.
â¢ When so much of meaning and so much of what ij
most glorious in British history is embodied in an
old form it is well worth while to perpetuate the
form. When Edward takes his coronation oath he
will not speak of himself as a "war lord" nor talk
of "me and my army." He will speak of the British
constitution and the laws enacted by the British peo
ple. The pomp and parade that revive the flummery
of the middle ages will also revive the memory of the
great struggles of those ages by which the Commons
of Great Britain established their rights as a free peo
ple. It is not strange the British should preserve
customs that are so full of memories of the past, sig
nificance for the present and promise for the future
Liberty is so valuable a possession that even its pa
geantry is worth preserving.

THE FINANCIAL BILLS.
THE executive committee of the Indianapolis
Monetary Conference has continued its work:
for the security of the gold standard and the
maintenance of the parity of all our currency. It will
be seen that to carry the vast load of silver dollars
and prevent a slump that would make them the ac
tual basis of our credit the exchangeability of the two
metals at the will of the holder must be provided for.
This step is taken in a bill now before the Coinage
Committee of the House, and its passage at this ses
sion is so desirable that business men all over the (
country should be heard from by their Representatives
and Senators in its behalf. This legislation completes
the basic principle of the gold standard and is be
lieved to secure that standard from successful assault
by any other method than its direct repeal.
The present Congress passed the gold standard law
and should pass this completion and finality of thru
statute, and the business community should urge it to
do so.
Â¦ The next Congress has many new men in it who
have not taken part in the discussion of this part of
the needed financial legislation. If it is passed to
them they must begin at the beginning of the subject.
For this reason the bill should be passed by a Con
gress that has already debated it and knows the need
of it. . '
The committee will have work enough for the next
Congress on another branch of the subject.* With the
gold standard efficiently established we may safely
begin reforms in our banking system, which should
be made a more useful instrument for the convenience
of the people. That subject may well occupy the at
tention of the next Congress.
fl TRIUMPH OF INSOLENCE.
THE Committee on Finance of the Federal Sen
ate has reported the House bill amendatory of
the war revenue act of JS98 with a provision
which relieves the express companies of the country
from further concern about their unstamped receipts
?.nd bills of lading. If the amendatory measure i*
passed â which is extremely probableâ the burden of
j-ayir.g the expenses of the late war and supporting
the Government's Philippine policy will be taken
fiom the backs of these corporations and placed
i-pon the backs of the people.
This action by Congress may be designated as a
complete triumph of the meanest, the most un
patriotic and the most despicable of all the corpora -
tions which infest this unhappy land.
The war revenue act, of 1898 was passed during a
period of excitement which called for the manifesta
tion of all the finer attributes of national prid^ an<l
spirit. Every business interest affected by .that meas
ure responded promptly to the demand made upon it
for money with which to carry on the Spanish war â
except the corporations dngaged in the business oi
exprcssage. These organizations not only refused to
pay their taxes in the face of repeated rulings by the
officials of the Xation.il Government and repeated de
cisions by the courts of the different States, but they
expended large sums of money in employing lawyer,
tc carry their contumaciousness to the United States
Supreme Court.
That tribunal finally decided, not that the stamp tax
hr.d not been properly levied upon them, but that they
might by increasing their rates shift it upon their cus
tomers. This decision pointed out a way by which the
entire burden Â«of sustaining the Government in its
hour of trial could be transferred, and no time was
lost by the express companies in availing themselves
of it.
But the fact still remains that before this decision
was rendered they extorted the money from their cus
tomers with which to pay for the stamps required to
he placed upon their receipts and bills of lading. The
result of it all is that they have demonstrated to the
nation the insolent proposition that resistance in the
payment of war taxes by corporations, if persisted in,
may be made successful.
We doubt whether the annals of the country fur
nish a more irritating instance of corporation defiance
than is supplied by these express corporations in con
nection with these war taxes. Congress has done it
self no credit by withdrawing from the contest in thii
manner. It should have relevied the tax and en
forced its payment out of the income of the con
tumacious corporations. The fact that the nation's
legislators have meekly responded to the insolence nf
the express companies by acceding to their demands
is one of the most extraordinary cases of humility
on record. These corporations have spat upon Con
preps, spurned the nation's Government, and, like;
Fc.sÂ«, Tweed, are now asking, "What are you going to
do about it?" "-â¢? '
The spectacle is not one which is calculated to in
spire patriotic sentiments among the people. If jus
tice were done, these corporations would be driven out
of business and compelled to leave the country to
which they are a disgrace.
Mining at Cape Nome promises to be somewhat

for mutual protection. This matter will
have to be handled with considerable
diplomacy, or it will result in placing
these members in a hopeless and neglected
minority.â Grass Valley Union.
The Legislature Is still largely occupied
with matters of patronage. The advantage
of that is that while so engaged it cannot
be passing useless or vicious legislation.â
San Jose Herald.
If the bill introduced in the Legislature
the other day making slander # a misde
meanor should happen to pass, ladles'

Marysvllle Appeal.
An extra*, session of the Legislature Is
talked of. What have we done that this
affliction should be visited upon us.âTe
hachapi Tomahawk.
The problem of patronage is a serious
one to the members of the Legislature. If
the taxpayers thoroughly understood the
pressure brought to bear upon them by
persistent friends who are looking for a
maximum salary for a minimum service
they would npt be subjected to such mer
ciless criticism.â Woodland Democrat.
The recesses of the Legislature are quite
frequent and llheral in lensth. Sunday is
the pivotal time. The closed season is gen
erally from Friday noon to Monday, but
the open season ia not characterized by a
copious output of finished laws. In fact,
it 1b remarked by lawmakers themselves
that the session Is unusually innocuous.
The witty an.l late George D. Prentice
once, said that .tbere._wexe. two periods
when Congress didn't do much that was
worth while. One was before the holiday
recess and the other after. May this br
said of California's Legislature?â Alameda
Argus.
The manner In which the Legislature
has been employing Its time is summed
up by Webber of Napa, who said Friday
that "they had been in session for two
weeks and had accomplished practically
nothing more than the appointment of
many House officials, whose worth was
demonstrated by the fact that a commit
tee was required to find them." â San Ber
nardino Times-Index.
Just a trifle over two hundred bills were
introduced In the Assembly on the first
occasion. There were bills amending
everything. Men who don't know a code
from a ham were well in front introducing
amendments of which they neither knew
the value nor cared.â Jacksonville Repub
lican.
the Senate have it up their sleeves to
knife everything In sight which does not
comport with their mode of legislating for
the dear people. â Oakdale Leader.

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
ORIENTAL FIGHTS.
THE CALL has disclosed a condition of affairs in joint overland and Oriental
freight charges that arouses the keenest apprehension of all men who cherish the in
terests of San Francisco.
It is bad enough to see a steamer clear for Oriental ports loaded full of Eastern
merchandise while 'San Francisco* freight is left on the dock, and our merchants are com
pelled to wire customers in Japan and China that they are unable to fill orders, because
they cannot ship the goods. But time might remedy that condition. Shipping facilities
might be chartered, and though some orders might be lost, the trade could be recovered
by securing certainty of transportation.
But, unfortunately, the trouble is not of that avoidable character. It is not only a
question of transportation facilities, but of freight charges, and the latter branch of it, is
capable, alone, of destroying San Francisco's Oriental trade.
The process of making this city a way station on the road to the East has begun
by the institution of a through rate, including car haul and ship haul, from mid-con
tinental and Atlantic points. The land and water transportation being treated as one
haul, and that haul affected by the competition of the Suez Canal, San Francisco is side>
tracked.
A glance at the schedule discloses the destructive situation. The rate on canned
goods from all Eastern- points to San Francisco is $i per ioo pounds; but the rate on the
same goods from all Eastern points to the Orient is, by the same schedule, only 90
cents! As the water rate on canned goods from San Francisco is 40 cents, our joint rate
to the Orient is $1 40, as against 90 cents enjoyed by New York and other Eastern points.
Of course that advantage of 50 cents per 100 against San Francisco shuts us out of the
market.
The rate on alcohol from Eastern points to San Francisco is 85 cents. From the
same points to the Orient it is 80 cents. Liquors to San Francisco from New York and
the East pay $1 15, and from the. same points through San Francisco to the Orient
they pay only 80 cents. â¢
The same disadvantage to San Francisco runs through the entire schedule, apply
ing to agricultural implements, machinery, manufactures of metal, fabrics and the whole
list of merchandise that finds a market in the Orient. New York, Chicago, St. Louis and
all Eastern points reach the Orient cheaper than San Francisco can. We are deprived
of the natural advantage of our geographical position, and the ocean that\washes our
coast is of no benefit to us. The Oriental market is closed to our jobbers and manufac
turers, and we are left to stew in our own juice.
The situation is serious; it is startling, and a remedy must be sought immediately.
One reflection that it induces is, that this is one result of the ownership of transcon
tinental lines in New York. With the ending of our California railroad dynasty, and
the death of the last builder of the system that first connected us with the East, Califor
nia control of a transcontinental road ceased, and now every road that leads eastward
from this coast is under Eastern control, and that means the dominance of Chicago, St.
Louis and New York. This through rate to the Orient from those points is the first fruit
of the passing of the old order. It is a bitter fruit. It dissipates into thin air the great
dreams of the commercial supremacy of this city and of other coast points. The trade we
expected to control will pass over us like the wind, and leave no increment.
Our merchants should move speedily for a remedy. It may be found in the Inter
state Commerce Commission. ' That body- derives its existence from the fourth clause of
article I, section 8, of the Federal constitution, which reads: "Congress shall have power
to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and arffong the several States, and with the
Indian tribes."
When the act creating the commission was before Congress it was contended by
Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware that that clause did not give Congress the power
to regulate freight rates on interstate commerce. The advocates of the law held other
wise and declared that such was the regulation intended by the constitution. Thereupon
Senator Bayard contended that in that case Congress derived from the same source the
power to regulate freight rates on foreign commerce, carried on by sea.
The Supreme Court,affirmed the constitutionality of the interstate commerce act,
and it seems to us at the same time affirmed public jurisdiction over ocean freight rates
on all commerce that enters and clears in an American port.
If this be true, the Oriental rate from New York and Eastern points is obnoxious
to the fourth clause of the interstate commerce law, which prohibits a' less gross charge to
a farther than a nearer point from the origin of the haul.
Pacific Coast points should immediately make a case before the Interstate Com
merce Commission, and if need carry it up to the Supreme Court on the issue of jurisdic
tion over ocean freigiits.

THE schooner Mary Buhne came
back to port yesterday In distress.
She left here for Eureka last Tues
day and as soon as she got out
side ran into a northwester. When
off Fish Rock the foresail was blown out
of the bolt ropes. Then an old-fashioned
nor'wester came down on the schooner.
The jib was blown to ribbons and when
the flying jib began to go Captain Danne
vig sent Joe Weaver, John Weller and H.
Anderson out to secure it. With the fly-
Ing jib gone there would Rave been noth
ing left to keep the vessel's head to the
sea and she would probably have
broached to and capsized.
As it was matters were bad enough and
the Mary Buhne had to turn tail and run
for San Francisco. While the schooner
was pitching: into the head sea and the
men were hard at work on the flying Jib
a giant sea came alont? and swept the
three sailors from the foot rope. Ander
son succeeded In holding on to a gasket,
while Weaver caught a chainplate. John
Weller. however, was washed away and
was not seen again. Anderson was not
badly injured, but Weaver had his ribs
broken and was one mass of contusions
from head to foot. He was attended by
Dr. Frank Robinson as soon as tho
schooner came to an anchorage and will
recover.
The Mary Buhne will be overhauled and
make another start far Humboldt.

Â¦ Captain C. Percy Smith, -formerly man
ager'of the Palace Hote!, arrived here on
the steamer China yesterday after several
years' - absence in the Orient. Captain
Smith figured quite prominently in tha
recent Boxer uprising: in fact, he has
been heralded as one of the heroes of the
defense of the legations at Peking.
Years ago the captain was an officer In
the English army. When the trouble in
China began he was at Mongolia, where
he was recommlssloned and was placed in
charge of a detachment of British Raval
Marines. It was Captain Smith who took
command of the troops at the Peking wall
when Captain Myers of the American ds
tachment fell. Smith says he never met
a pluckier lot of fellows than were the
United States marines, who had th*
toughest place in the fighting line, but
who held their position for fourteen days
like Trojans.
Captain Smith was kicked by a horse
while, in China and he has suffered consid
erably from blood poisoning ever sinco.
After spending a 'week or two here ha
will go to his home in Kngland.

At- first thought it might seem that
Hawthorne was no humorist As ono
reads the somber pages of "The Scarlet
Letter." with their level gloom, their in
tensity, their minute study of a great sin;
or as one opens here and there among
the short Btorles. with their cold allegory,
their welrdness and mysticism, one might
say surely there is no humor in this great,
melancholy, almost morbid genius. Such
a conclusion, however, comes only from a
superficial reading of Hawthorne. Humor,
veiled and sly. Is found everywhere In his
pages. Even in ."The Scarlet Letter,"
the most unrelieved of all his pictures of
sin and its results, there Is humor, even
comedy." Says Anthony Trollope:
"Through all this intensity of suffering*,
through this blackness of narrative, there
is ever running a vein of drollery. Aa
Hawthorne himself says. *a lively sense
of the humorous again stole in among the
solemn â¢ phantoms- of her (Hester's)
Holmes is beyond doubt the greatest of
American wits; Lowell Is his only rival.
Others have equaled and even surpassed
him In parts of the fieldâ Saxe, for * In
stance, surpassed him as a master of
comic rhyme and of telling puns: but none
covered 30 wide an area of brilliancy as
he. As a humorist he is equaled only, by
Lowell, and surpassed, perhaps, only by
Irving. Combining all or hla powersâ wit,
humor, satire, comedyâ he doubtless has
no - master In American literature.
His influence Is stamped not only upon
the literature:, but also upon the char
acter of the age.' In the words of John
W-. Chadwlck: "It does not appear. that
any one else did so much as Dr. Holmes
to change the social temper of New Eng
land; to make it less harsh and joyless,
and to make easier for his fellow country
men the .transition from old things -to
new." '.- x*-~
I never laughed at my landlady after she had
told me her story, but I often criedâ not those
pattering tears that run off the eaves upon our
neighbors' yards, the stllUcldlum of self-con
scious sentiment, but those which steal noise
lessly through their conduits until they reach
the cisterns lying round about the heart; those
tears that we weep Inwardly with unchanging
featuresâ such did I shed for her often when
the Imps of the boarding-house Inferno tugged
at her soul with their redhot pinchers.
Holmes' humor is usually at its best in
his poems. In his early work ltÂ«was often
broad and sometimes farcical, such
poems as "Evening, by a Tailor." "The
Dorchester Giant," "The Comet." "The
September Gale," "The Ballad of the Oy
sterman" and "The Height of the Ridicu
lous" are full of unrestrained fun, of bur
lesque and of parody. His fun is at its
best in such well-known humorous clas
sics as "The Deacon's Masterpiece." "How
the Old Horse Won the Bet" and "The
Broomstick Train."
Of pathos Holmes had a true mastery.
He is never mawkish and oversentlmental.
like Dickens; he is never morbid and in
trospective. He combined healthful pa
thos with his wit in such a way as to
produce humor of the truest type. The
exquisite tenderness and yet the droll
touches of "The Last Leaf" have rarely
been surpassed, even by Hood. The "Auto
crat" series Is full of humor in its truest
formâ of human life. Its foibles and fol
lies handled with sympathy and intuition.
How admirably are the ludicrous charac
teristics of the little deformed man. "the
sculpin," tempered and swallowed up In a
gradual outpouring of tenderness and true
pathos. Says Stedman: "The poet of 'The
Last Leaf was among the flrs$ to teach
his countrymen that pathos Is an equal of
true humor, that sorrow is lightened by
jest and jest redeemed from coarseness
by emotion, under most conditions of this,
our evanescent human life."

Do you mean to say the pun question Is not
clearly settled in your minds? Let me lay
down the law upon the subject. Life and lan
guage are alike sacred. Homicide and verblcide
âthat is, violent treatment of a word, with
fatal results to Its legitimate meaning, which is
Its life â are alike forbidden. Manslaughter,
which is the meaning of the one, is the same
as man's laughter, which is the end of the
other.
His epigrams are brilliant and full of
practical wisdom:
He speaks of "the Mar.iulay flowers of litera
ture." He suggested that .the new magazine
founded In 1857 be called the Atlantic, because
it's a notion. He maintained that evening dren
was the close of the day. Inquired once . what
was the cosine of Noah's ark. and believed
that an onion was like a piano, because it
amell odious.
Holmes' mind was as ready and as elec
tric as Sydney Smith's. He could never
be surprised or worsted In retort. Even
his puns are flashes of genius:
His "Autocrat" papers are an encyclo
pedia of epigram, puns, proverbs, wisdom
and brilliant observations on every topic
under the sun. They are more than thisâ
they are full of pathos, of sentiment, of
rare characterization, of poetry and of
pictures as sharp in outline and as firm in
execution as Flemish paintings. It would
be easy to nil a book with the wit and
wisdom of Holmes, another with his puns
and repartee, another with comic touches
and broad fun and still another with
pathos and true humor. Indeed, take
these elements from his books, and how
much would remain?
Holmes stands pre-eminent as the
greatest of American wits; he is the Syd
ney Smith of our literature. As Lowell
declared in 1848, he
"is famous among you for wit â
A Ley den Jar always full charged, from which

"When we turn to that somewhat small
group of authors who produced what may
fairly be called the American classics we
find on the whole a surprisingly small
amount of wit and even of humor. The
great creative' period was the result of a
mental ard moral revolution, and an in
tense earnestness, almost a solemnity,
that marks a great part of its literary
product. Bryant is cold, classical and per
fect; Emerson is, first of all, a thinker
and a reformer; Longfellow Is lull of
sympathy and humanity, but he is never
really humorous; Whlttier, with his burn-
Ing message and his loving studies of New
England life. Is a humorist only as every
great, sympathetic, original observer ot
human life is such; Thoreau often chuck

that plays about the subject like the
lambent flumes of Incandescent coal."
His humor often takes the form of a
playful irony:
On this particular forenoon, so excessive was
the warmth of Judge Pyncheon's kindly as
pect, that (such at least was the rumor about
town) an extra passage of the water carts
was founil essential in order to lay the dust

One point in which he had vastly the advan
tage over his four-footed brethren was his
ability tr> recollect the good dinners which It
had made no small portion of the happiness of
his life to eat. His gourmand ism was a highly
agreeable trait, and to hear him talk of roa.it
meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an
oyster. As he possessed no higher tribute, and
neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual
endowment by devoting all his Â«nertft3 and
ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit
of his maw. it always pleased and satisfied
me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry and
butcher's meat, and the most eligible methods
of preparing them for the table. â¢ â¢ â¢ There
were flavors on his palate that had linger*!

were still 'apparently as fresh as that of the
mutton chop which he had Just devoured for
breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips

tenderloin of beef, a hindquarter of veal, a

the events that brightened or darkened his
Individual career, had gone over him with as
little permanent â¢ effect as the passing breese.
The chief tragic event of the old man's life,
so far as I could Judge, was his mishap with
a certain jcoose, which lived and died sÂ»ma
twenty or forty years ago; a goose of most
promising* figure, but which at table proved
so inveterately tough that the carving knife
trould make no impression on Us carcass, and
it could only be divided with an ax and hand
saw.
Mrs. Stowe, like her brother. Henry
Ward Beecher. had a rich vein or humor.
It crops out here and there In "Uncle
Tom's Cabin." Topsy is genuinely hu
morous, and so is Mis' Ophelia, with her
New England ideals and her contempt for
Southern "shiftle33ness." But It is in her
later work, ber minute and loving studies
of the New England life that she knew
so well, that she is at her best. "Old
town Folks" and "The Minister's "Woo
ing" are most delightful reading. Sam
Lawson is one of the few American hu
morous creations that are worthy of a
place beside Ichabod Crane and Hoaea
Biglow. He is drawn from the life with
accuracy and sympathy: he seems like
one whom we have seen and known:
He was a soft-hearted old body, and the wrlg
gUngs and contortions of our prey used to dis
turb his repose so that it was a regular part of
his work to kill the fish by the breaking of
their necks when he took them from the hook.
"My. lordy massy, boys," he would say, "I
can't bear to see no kind o' critter in torment.
These 'ere pouts ain't to blame for beln' fish,
and ye ought to put 'em out of their misery.
Fish hes their rights as well as any of
us." â¢ â¢ â¢
I shall never forget the wrath and dismay
which he roused in my Aunt Lots' mind by the
leisurely way in which, after having taken our
own venerable kitchen clock to pieces, and
strewn the fragments all over the kitchen, he
would roost over It in endless incubation, tell
ing stories, entering into long-winded theologi
cal discussions, smoking pipes and giving his
terles of all the other clocks in Oldtown. with
occasional memories of those in Medmore, the
North Parish and Podank. as placidly Indiffer

"Why, ye see. Miss Lois." he would say,
"clocks can't be druv: that's Jest what they
can't. Some things can be druv. and then again
some things can't, and clocks is that kind.
* * * Don' t you be a grain uneasy. Miss Lois.
Why. I'll have your clock all right in the end.
but I can't be druv. Wall. I guess I'll take
another spell on't to-morrow or Friday."
Many of the lesser writers of the pe
riod were true humorists. J. T. Trow
brldge, in his novels like "Coupon Bonds"
and in a few genuine lyrics like "The Vag
abonds," has created humor of real value;
and Edward Everett Hale, especially in
his earlier short stories like ''My Dou
ble, and How He Undid Me." has pro
duced a priceless store of rollicking, con
tagious fun, always kindly and always
optimistic.
Of the younger group of classic writers
Howells with his merry farces and Aid
rich with his brilliant and witty short
stories may be regarded as the leading
humorists. Such merry parlor comedies
as Howells* "Mouse Trap," "The Albany-
Depot" and "The Elevator" are among
the best things of their kind to be founa
anywhere. They fairly sparkle with wit
and word play, and their revelations of
the weak sides of human nature, together
with their comic situations and ludicrous
Incidents, make them Irresistibly amus
ing. It Is impossible to do Justice to them
by short quotations.
The most humorous work of Aldrtch is
undoubtedly his "Marjorle Daw," a crea
ticn that has taken a secure place among
the few really great American short stor
ies. Exquisite finish and perfect art char
acterize every creation from the hand of
this master workman. His humor con
sists In brilliant dialogue. In unexpected
effects led up to with rare skill, and in
droll characterizations and irresistible sit
uations. Wit and brilliant epigram are
everywhere in his prose writings: even
bis works of travel are humorous crea
tions.
These are but the representative humor
ist? of the great creative period. A whole
scries of papers would be required to
touch upon all who created really humor
ous work during the middle years of the
century. We can deal only with the mas
ters, with those truly original spirits who
added rev? elements to our national hu
mor or who found new combinations for
old forms and thus Influenced widely their
times and their descendants.

George T. Callahan, a saloon-keeper at
2249 Powell street, has been cited to ap
pear before Superior Judge Dunne next
Monday morning to show cause why he
should not be punished for contempt of
court. He was arrested last night and
subsequently released on $100 bail. If the
charge made against him is found to be
true when the contempt proceedings are
heard it is not improbable that he will be
called upon to face a charge of felony. He
is accused of attempting to tamper with
the Jury In the case of I*>uis Parentl, a
tailor living at 408 Francisco street, who
received goods stolen by W. D. Thomp
son, a teamster, from ths railroad depot.
J. F. Nichols and James H. Anderson*
Jurors In thÂ© Parentl case, reported to As
sistant District Attorney Greany yester
day that Callahan approacned them and
asked them not to believe the witnesses
for the prosecution, alleging that there
was a conspiracy to ruin Parentl. It was
on this Information that Greany asked
for the arrest of Callahan for contempt
of court.
Thompson, who some time agt> pleaded
rullty to thÂ© theft of the- goods from thÂ©
depot, was the principal witness against
Parentl. The Jurors In Parentl's casÂ© werÂ©
out but a few minutes before they agreed
upon a verdict finding him 'guilty as

The Prison Directors were to hold a reg

when they expected to hear the report of
Expert MacLaren on the amount of Wal

the Senators and the Assemblymen to San

not been learned.
Six members of the State Senate and
five members of the Assembly arrived In
the city last night on their way to San
Quentin to investigate the "jute mill"
scandal. Senator Belshaw, chairman of
the Senate committee, hinted to his five
colleagues before they left Sacramento
that this was -no pleasure jaunt and that
he would expect them all to take the 7:30
boat this morning for San Quentin.
Belshaw deplores the fact that he and
the other members of the committee will
be handicapped in their investigation by
lack of time, but he claims that he will
havu as thorough an investigation as pos
sible. The programme laid out Is for the
Senators to leave early this â¢morning for

ARE EARLY BIRDS
Business of an exceedingly Important
nature was transacted at the semi-annual
meeting of the Teachers' Mutual Aid.So
ciety, held In Sherman-Clay Hall yester
day afternoon. The proceedings were en
livened by frequent spirited discussions
and lively exchanges of opinion.
The first matter of importance which
came before the meeting was final action
on an amendment Introduced by Caroline
L. Hunt providing for an increase In the
amount of sick benefits payable to a mem
ber in case of sickness. The by-laws pro
vided that after $300 at the rate of $10 per
week had been paid during a period of
sickness benefits should cease. The
amendment was to the effect that after
that time a member should receive $5 until
the end of her sickness. The amendment
was finally adopted, but not without a
valiant fight on the part of Its supporters.
If the foregoing amendment occasioned
a lively discussion, it was nothing In com
parison with what followed when Mrs.
Mary Prag proposed to create a fund for
the care of the incurable members of the
society by setting aside 10 cents from the
monthly dues of each member.
At this proposal a whole volume of
schoolroom eloquence burst forth. All
present â¢ commended the spirit of the
amendment, but disagreed as to the mode
of . accomplishing - its - purpose, i â¢ Some ar
gued that such a drain on the finances of
the society would send it into . immediate
bankruptcy, and that the dues should be
raised in order to furnish . the necessary
funds. Others claimed that such a course
was out of the province of an aid society
and suggested the formation of an auxil
iary branch for the. specific y purpose of
caring for incurables. The .â¢ discussion
continued for fully an hour, during which
many eloquent '.; words were spoken ' In
favor of the amendment and It was event
ually adopted.
But ' now conies . an unforeseen*- obstacle.
The by-laws provide that j an amendment
shall be proposed at least thirty days be
fore It can .be: adopted." 'This provision
was not complied with, and therefore' the
opponents assert that the amendment was
not legally, adopted.; Grave complications
may* arise from this oversight, as- two In
curables have already been placed on the
list for benefits. The amendment.,pro
vides ; - that no â¢ Incurable member â¢ shall'
draw more than $5 at one time/ â¢
The society Is now In an excellent con
dition. It has $500 In. its treasury, and the
names of 373 teachers on ita membership
role. ".sSSgsagisS - -

John H. O'Connor, the bellboy. /who. was
the only qye-witness of the tragedy, was
the first witness called, by District- Attor
ney Bylngton. and despite Attorney
Foote's efforts to break down parts or
Fcote contented himself with trying to
tangle the prosecution's witnesses on
minor details, but without much success.
It did not directly appear what line the
defense will adopt, although It seems
probable that Trewhella's alleged attack
on Mrs. Glaze will be the base of it.
The first business yesterday morning
was the explanation of -Police Corporal
George W. Russell's elaborate plan of the
scene of the murder and his explana
tion of the same. He also exhibited a
plan of the hotel office, marked exhibits a
and B for illustrating testimony. Photo
graphs of the stairs leading from the
kitchen and of the alleyway outside were
also offered In evidence.
As each accusing finger was successive
ly leveled at him and each witness told
his etory the confident air Glaze had worn
when he entered the courtroom in the
morning disappeared, and although he sat
the self-confessed slayer of his partner,
yet he followed every bit of testimony at
tentively, as it endeavoring to discover
what loophole his attorney, W. W. Foote,
was going to attempt to squeeze him
through to freedom. His wife sat by his
side throughout the day. None of Trew
hella's relatives were present. .
pointed to Robert Glaze as the
wlelder of the pistol which sent swift
death to William Trewhella, Glaze's busi
ness partner in the Windsor Hotel, on the
afternoon of January 14.
A BELLBOY, a policeman, a Chi
nese cook, two German tailors
and a gun store clerk in Police
Judge Conlan's court yesterday
The porter at the Windsor. Harry B.
Habens, testified to running to Trew
hella's aid when he heard the shots. He
said Trewhella lay with his back to the
baker, shop. - .-.
Edward C. McCormlck, the druggist,
who was called In, told'of the wounds he
Alfred Japgl, a tailor for Heed & Son,
whose windows overlook the alley, and
Fred Menz,' another tailor, told of seeing
Glaze come into the alleyway and unload
his pistol. They heard five shots fired.
John J. Wrens also heard the five shots
and saw Glaze unload the pistol.
Foote's first question was if O'Connor
knew a man named Merchant, who sup
plied meat to the hotel. In reply to the
attorney's interrogation as to whether it
was a fact that he had told Merchant he
knew nothing of th'e shootiner. O'Connor
said he had not done "so. O'Connor was
very positive that only two shots were
fired.
The bellboy told of answering a call to
ret a cocktail ahfl lemonade for some
guests. He went first to the bar, then to
the kitchen, to get limes from Trewhella.
Trewhella went to the storeroom to get
the limes. He had reached the landing
and was going into the old kitchen, or
bakery., v/hen the first shot was fired.
O'Connor saw Trewhella stagger, then
heard another shot, and the wounded man
fell to the ground. O'Connor then stood
on the top step. Glaze then came out of
the kitchen door, a revolver in his hand,
and said, "If any one asks you who snot
him, tell them he shot himself." He then
walked away and O'Connor ran to Trew
hella'a side to help him to his feet. O'Con
nor said Glaze was facing Trewhella when
he fired the shot. Of this he was certain.
his testimony he proved an effectual
weapon for the prosecution. O'Connor
made it evident that he was not going to
rfestify to anything he did not understand,
nor be "bulldozed," as he expressed it. He
and Foote had many a passage of argu

driver of which ex-idently knew them, as
he aided them in eluding their pursuers.
Cuyala, with the assistance of Officer P.

nicely printed pamphlet. It showed the
necessity of reservoirs; the gradual
growth of supply and decrease of price of

economy was followed in the construction
of the original plant of the Spring Valley

to Schussler is worth J5.400.000.
The confidence Intrusted to the Inquisi

question being asked him what he thought
the plant of the Spring Valley was worth.
He could not be pinned down to figures
at that time, but said that if the city
bought the works for $30,000,000 It would
be getting a bargain. He promised that
if given time he would prepare a report

The affairs of the Bell family were again
aired yesterday in Justice of the Peace
Long's court, when the suit brought by
Joseph Alexandra against Mrs. Theresa
Bell was on trial. Alexandre sued to re
cover the sum of $252 25 for board, cloth-
Ing and sundry articles noted In a bill of
particulars and furnished Roblna. Muriel
and Eustace, minor children of Mrs. Bell.
In his complaint Alexandra alleged that
the three children had abandoned their
mother with Just cause, as they were com
pelled to leave her home because she neg
lected to provide necessary articles for
their Welfare and comfort.
Mrs. Bell In her own behalf denied that
she neglected to provide for the children.
She testified that their half-sister, Marie
T. Bell, had Induced them to rebel against
their mother's authority In the- hope that
Marie would be appointed their guardian
and thus have the custody of large sums
of Â¦ money from the â¢ estate of the late
Thomas Bell. In fact, Marie only with
drew her application to be guardian after
Judge Coffey declined to allow her $20,000
out of the estate.
Mrs. Alexandre testified that when the
children came to her their wardrobe was
very limited. Their wardrobe consisted
of many fancy clothes, but none that were,
useful. In rebuttal Mrs. Bell testified
that she had sold her books and mort
gaged her property to buy necessaries for
the children. Judge Long decided in her
favor on the ground that there was no
showing made that the children had left
her with Just cause.
MBS. BELL WINS CASE
HT JUSTICE'S COTJRT
Bitter realization of the effect of the
acts of the rail carriers was manifested
on every side yesterday. No definite ac
tion was taken. There is .little doubt that
the Interests' of San Francisco 'and of the
coast will be represented at the next meet
ing of the Transcontinental Association
at Milwaukee. There are several organ
izations which have in the past. interested
themselves in the subject of freight rates,
including the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and
Manufacturers' Association, the Pacific
Coast Metal and Hardware Association
and the Associated Wholesale Grocers.
Some one or all of these bodies may be
heard in protest against the rates that
will surely deprive San Francisco and
other Pacific Coast points of any chance
to export to any extent to the Oriental
countries. None of them, has acted as yet.
The question Is one of such great impor
tance that no hasty move is likely to be
made.
Owing to the great disgust and exas
peration of the commercial community at
the â¢ action of the transcontinental lines
some new organization may result. The
talk In favor. of such an organization was
stronger yesterday than on the day pre
ceding.
W. R. Wheeler said that under the ex
isting conditions San Francisco's antici
pation of being a large factor in the- Ori
ental trade wus evidently fallacious. He
deplored the facts. He was not of thÂ©
opinion that' the transcontinental lines
would be easily persuaded to change their
policy. As he understood the matter,
their action was based on the claim that
they made the rates to compete with the
Suez canal. He supposed that they made
the rates as high as they thought they
could to Oriental points and still retain
the business, for it was natural to believe
that they got all the money they thought
they could out of the business. The Ori
ental rates were made without reference
to the rates to San Francisco from the
East. To make a market for California
manufactured articles in the Orient H
would be necessary, first, to get a large
enough home market. The unit of cost
diminished Inversely to the volume of
manufacture and that is what gives the
East an overwhelming advantage. Ths
Eastern manufacturer Is near the center
of population.
Jacob Levi Jr. said that the Oriental
rates would. If kept in force, cut off San
Francisco from exporting to China and
Japan on its own account. Certain com
mission houses that represent Eastern
lines of goods might not be much affect
ed, only it would be impossible for San
Francisco to bring Eastern goods here
and then send them to the Orient in com
petition with the through rates from New
York, Chicago, St. Louis, etc. From the
conditions nere existing, the relative
scarcity of manufacturing' enterprises in
San Francisco and also because of the
fact that the great bulk of goods in which
San Francisco merchandises must be
brought here, it is clear that a deadly
blow has been aimed at San Francisco's
dream of becoming a distributing center
for the trade of the Orient. .
"It is all wrong," said William Cluff,
president of the Associated Wholesale
Grocers, "and something: ought to be done
if any measure can be devised to bring
relief. I confess that I do not. see the
way out yet.. Consequently I cannot dis
cuss the situation as fully as I might
otherwise be able to do. All the trans
continental roads - and their steamship
connections to ; the Orient are in the ar
rangement. I have heard of talk of
some eort of an organization to pave" the
way for doing something, but do not
know anything about what plan might be
adepted. San Francisco will meet bitter
disappointment in failing to secure the
Oriental trade, which seemed to be Bafely
ours until the rates mentioned In The
Call this morning were put into effect.
Our side of the caso ought to be fully
presented."
The commercial community of San
Francisco pondered angrily yesterday
over the facts exclusively published In
The Call concerning the rates on freights
from New York. Chicago. St. Louis and
other Eastern and Middle "West points to
the Orient. The merchants saw clearly
that giving the East lower rates to the
Orient than San Francisco has. when the
sea carriage from this port Is added to
the overland rate, must effectually de
stroy any export trade that belongs to
San Francisco under natural conditions,
if the rates are maintained.

The Most Important Period in a
Woman's Existence. â Mrs. John-
son Tells How She Was Helped
Over the Trying Time.
Oyving- to modern methods of living, not one woman in a thousand ap-
proaches this perfectly natural change Without experiencing a train of very
annoying, and sometimes painful symptoms.
Thoso dreadfnl hot flashes, sending the blood surging to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, sometimes with chills,
as if the heart were going to stop for good, are only a- few of the symptoms of
a dangerous nervous trouble. Tho nerves are crying out for assistance. Tho
cry should bo heeded in time. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was
prepared to meet the needs of woman's system at this tryinjr period of her life.
The three following letters are guaranteed to be genuine and true, and
still further prove what a great medicine Lydia E. Pinkharn'3 Vegetable
Compound is for women.
Mar. 12, 1397.
" Dear Mrs. Petkham : â I have been sick for a long time. I was taken
sick with flooding. All my trouble seemed to be in the womb. I ache all the
time at the lower part of the womb. The doctor says the womb is covered
with ulcers. I suffer with a pain on the left side of my hack over the kidney.
I am fifty years old and passing through the change of "life. Please advise mo
what to do to get relief. Would like to hear from you as eoon as possible. w â

" I have been taking your remedies, and think they have helped me a great
deal. I had been in bed for ten weeks when I began taking your Vegetable
Compound, but after using it for a short time I was able to be up around the
house. The aching in the lower part of womb ha3 left me. The most that
troubles me now is tho flowing. That is not so bad, but still there is a little
every day. I am not discouraged yet, and shall continue with your medicine,
. for I believe it will cure me." â Mbs. Chablotte JoiC73o^r, Monclova,Ohio.
April 13, 1S00.
" I send you this letter to publish for the benefit of others. I was sick for
about nine years so that I could not-do my work. For three months I could
not sit up long enough to have my bed made. I had five different doctors, and
all said th#re was no help for me. My trouble was change of life. I suffered
with nlceration or the womb, pain in sides, kidney and stomach trouble, back-
ache, headache, and dizziness. I am. well and strong, and feel like a new
person. My recovery is a perfect surprise to everybody that knew me. I owe
all to Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I would not do without
your medicine for anything. There is no need of women suffering so much if
they would take your remedies, for they are a sure cure."â Mbs. Charlotte
Johxso*, Monclova, Ohio.
, ; When one stops to think about the good Mrs. Johnson derived from Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine, it seems almost beyond belief ; yet it is all
true as stated in her three letters published above at her own request.
As a matter of positive fact Mrs. Pinkham has on file thousands of
letters from women who have been safely carried through that danger period
"Change of Life." Mrs. Johnson's cure is not an unusual one for Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine to accomplish. >Â»

DEPEW SPEAKS
ON SUBSIDY BILL
JEREMIAH CURTIN. author and
linguist, was a passenger on the-
China, which arrived In port yester
day. Mr. Curtin is the English
translator of "Quo Vadis" and
other works by the famous Polish author,
and he has himself written several books,
one of the best known of which is "Cre
ative Myths of Primitive America."
Mr. Curtin has > spent the past ten
months in foreign travel, Siberia being his
longest stopping point. His visit to Siberia
was prompted by a desire to study the
habits and beliefs of an odd people that
Inhabit the Amur Valley and western part
of Lake Baikal. They are known as the
Buriats and number about 200,000. They
are a division of the Mongol race and have
preserved the original religion of the Mon
gols to a remarkable extent.
"That is why I have made a study of
these queer people." said Mr. . Curtin, in
relating his travels at the Occidental last
evening. "I spent three months among
them, during which time I collected a
number of sacred stories containing ac
counts, of their religion. I was an eye
witness of the weird horse sacrifice,
which is one of the peculiar features of
their religious beliefs.
"Seven brood mares are procured on a
certain day once every year, and having
been led solemnly into a large arena or
open field sixteen men are selected to at
tend each horse," continued Mr. Curtin.
"First, ropes are tied to all four legs of
"Any statement of the conditions pre
vailing in the islands during the last six
months which ignores the effect of the
American election as a controlling element
in the situation is necessarily inadequate.
Since the result was announced there has
been a great decrease in insurgent activ
ity. The tntenseet Interest was felt by the
insurgents before the election in the issue
and the intensest disappointment since,
which win certainly effect the collapse of
the insurrection in the near future. From
now on conditions in \hese islands will
grow steadily better." Â¦ .
In Southern Luzon the conditions have
Improved in the ; provinces of Cavite,
Batangas and Lnguna during the last
month. The province of Tayabas is
peaceful. In the Camarines and Albey
the conditions are not so satisfactory, but
they are growing better. In the Vlsay
ar.c and Mindanao the conditions are much
the same a* reported August except
that in Leyte much improvement has
been made. The report adds:
"From all the information we can get,
it seems clear that a great majority of the
people long for peace and are entirely
willing to accept the establishment of a
fovernment under the supremacy of the
'nited States. They are, however, re
strained by fear from taking any action
to assist in the suppression of the insur
rection. Any one suspected of giving in
formation to the Americans concerning
the insurgents is Immediately marked for
assassination. The ramifications of the
conspiracy are so wide that it has effected
the terrorism of an entire people. " It is
a Matta Â«n a very large scale."
The report itself is. a very voluminous
production, divided into many heads, ex
hibiting the progress made by the com
mission in carrying out its plans for the
Americanization of the Islands. A par
ticularly Interesting section of the report,
introducing the whole of the Philippine
questions, deals with military and politi
cal conditions, the effect of the American
elections and legislative procedure and
acts. The commission says that examina
tions of many witnesses a* to the form of
government best adapted to these islands
and satisfactory to the people show ,1'that
the masses of the people are ignorant,
credulous and childlike and that under
any government the electoral franchise
must be much limited, because the large
majority will not, for a long time, be cap
able of intelligently exercising it.
Since -writing: you about 3000 insurgents in
IIocob None have surrendered and about 10,000
persons who were not well affected toward us
in Panay have taken the oath of allegiance.
I have already received two papers from na
tive priests, eighteen In number, and I am
told that there will be a rreat many other
papers signed by more native priests tendering
their allegiance to the United States and prom
ising- fidelity without mental reserve. Th*
native priests are those who have held out
longest in favcr of the insurgents and against
the Americans, and I deem this action as of
great Importance. The army is hitting small
but hard knocks against the insurgents every
where. Since the election there has been a
trreat falling:" off in Â¦ the activity of, the in
surgents in aggressiveness.
A personal letter received by me from
Judge Taft. dated December 14, 1900, Bays:
Secretary Root's letter of transmlttal.
dated January 24, addressed to the Presi
dent, says:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â The President
to-day transmitted toÂ» the Senate a report
of the Secretary of War, inclosing the re
port of the Taft Philippine Commission.
In his message of transmlttal the Presi
dent says the report includes not only the
report of the commission, but its acts of
legislation and other important informa
tion relating to the wants of the Philip
pines. Concluding, the President says:
"I earnestly recommend legislation un
der which the government of the Islands
may have authority to assist in their
peaceful industrial development In the di
rections indicated by the Secretary of
War."

MARKED PROGRESS
IN PHILIPPINES
The conference report was adopted. 183
to 100. Two Democrats. Clayton of New
York and Livingston of Georgia, voted for
the report.
consideration of the naval appropriation
bill was resumed.
Rlxey of Virginia moved to recommit
the bill, with instructions to strike out the
provisions for the Increase of the navy
(two battleships and two cruisers). It was
defeated. 42 to 132.
The bill v.as then passed.
The House then took up private pension
bills. Mattrrs ran along smoothly until
n bill was reported to remove the charge
of dosTtion against a soldier.
Talbert of South Carolina declared that
it was an outrage that men who deserted
their flajf should have their records
cleared. While all bills for the removal
of the charge ol desertion contained a
provision that no pay or emolument
i-hould accrue en account of its passage,
he paid the provision was practically a
dead letter. He served notice that if he
could prevent it no other bill to remove
the charge of .desertion should pass bo
long es hÂ« was a member of the House.
Seventy-e^ven pension bills were passed.
At 5:05 p. m. the House adjourned.
"No." replied Richardson. "I would not
vrte for the bill." (Democratic applause Â»
Hay of Virginia resented indignantly
Richardson's ttatemer.t that the report
would pive the President the power to In
crease the army from SS.OIO to 100,000 men
and took the minority leader severely to
task for refusing to Join in a fight for a
temporary army when the bill was origin
ally before the House.
"The report empowers the President to
l nc^?r^ tho \\ anain * army from 58.000
to JOO.ofw men." replied Richardson. "If
that provision were out also "
"That Is not a categorical response "
observed Cannon. '
"If that provision were out of the bill."
interpiwd Cannon of Illinois, "would the
ppntleman vote for it?"
"Not here." replied Hull, "but it has
been outrageously delayed in the Congress
of thÂ« i;nitÂ«i States. Thirty-five thou
sand volunteers are ready to be shipped j
home, and they must be replaced by July !
1 by soldiers of the regular establishment
Â¦unless we are willing to do a great in
justice to tht-m by holding them there."
Proceeding. Hull explained in detail the
corcessions of the two housrs on the vari
ous items. In the course of his statement
he had a sharp exchange with Ttichard
fon. He made a strong appeal to both
sides of the House in favor of the pro
visions to retire General Shafter as a
major general end Generals Lee and Wil
son as brigadier generals, which the
House had stricken out.
He paid a high tribute to Generals Lee
find \V1!srn nnd passed a slowing eulogv
upon General Shafter, whose Santiago
campaign, he declared, would pare into
history as one of the greatest planned and
fought 5n any age.
Hull was closely questioned about vari
ous featurep of the conference report â¢ In
reply to Adams cf Pennsylvania he said
The House conferees had made very little
effort to retain the House provision for a
veterinary corps. Adams insisted that the
Honce conferees should have stood bv the
H"U!Â»*> jirovlsion.
Hull declined to yield the floor to Ad
ams, but yielded six minutes to Rlchard
*nn of Tennessee, who desired to obtain
T^e floor in hrs own right. Richardson
paid that several questions upon which'
The House ha1 solemnly declared itself
hafl been yielded by the House conferees.
To vote for the report would now mean
to vote to increase the list of officers upon
th*- retired li-=t. to which he was unalter
ably opposed.
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 25â The House to-
Cay adopted the conference report upon
thf army reorganization bill. The con
test ov*>r it was brief, Hull, chairman of
The Military Affairs Committee, prevent
ing long debate. The debate was chiefly
r.otable for a short exchange between
Richardson, the minority leader, and Hay
<D.) of Virginia, a member of the confer
ence committee, Â¦who reproached the
Democratic loader for not making a fight
for a temporary army when the bill was
rrlginally befort he House. The naval
appropriation biU was finally pased to-day
and also seventy-seven private pension
bins.
Chairman Hull of the Committee on
Military Affairs, submitted to the House
the report or the army reorganization bill.
Richardson of Tennessee, the minority
leader, requested that the report be al
lowed to lie over until to-morrow. It had
not been printed, he said, and members
should have an opportunity to examine It.
Hull would not agree to this. He Bald
the confprf-nce had been full and fair in
the presence of the minority representa
tives, and while they did not agree to the
principles of an increase of the standing
army, they had agreed to the result. The
army bill, he paid, should have been a law
three weeks ago. It had been held up.
"It ha* not been held up here," observed
Richardson.
Owing to Hull's Manipula
tion the Contest Is
Brief.

Bradstreefs on Trade.
Much Irregularity has been 'seen In the
course of the: market this Week and Â¦ specula
tion was uncertain and variable In its tend
encies. On last Saturday and Monday the
chief influence was the expected death of
Queen Victoria, which - induced heavy nelllng
In the London market and caused foreign hold
ers to part with a considerable amount of
American securities. This, the
t'.rsettled feeling of last week.- about Indus
trials and the liquidation In the railroad share
list, led to ; further concessions in prices and
to a decided reduction in the volume of out
side participation In the market. On Tues
(5.?y, however, there was ' a decided- rally In
prices, due partly to the feeling that the death
of the Queen had been . fully, . perhaps ejecea
ofvely. discounted at London. Tha covering
of shorts was on an extensive scale, though
tho steel stocks were .again, subjected to a
certain amount of pressure. On the ensuing
day strength continued In the early transac
tions, followed, .however, by renewed Belling
and finally- by a rally which lasted until the
end of the first hour's trading on Thursday.
Dullness, however, supervened and the market
hung heavily until the af tef noon. Â¦ .when : bear
ish Interests became more < active and suc
ceeded In forcing down prices throughout the
active list. The opening .on Friday, was: weak,
In sympathy with lower prices In London, but
support was once more shown In various parts
.if the list and short- covering in j various | di
rections also set Â¦ in,- Â¦ resulting In a moderate
demand -at the close.

WHEATâ Liverpool was firmer, with more
inquiry, principally owing to the bullish news
irom the Argentine, but Paris was weak. New
York advanced. United 'States Consul Swalm
rt ports that the Argentine surplus will not -be
over half of last year's. The crop in the River
Platte provinces is bad. both in the Argentine
and Uruguay. On the Argentine side .there Is
lot over 13'4 bushels to the 2.47 acres, while
11 Is doubtful whether "Crusuay will nave

NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â Prices traversed a
considerable range to-day from the lowest to
the top level, covering one point for a large
nurr.ber of nock? and ranging from 2 to about
Z'tt for (pome cf the most prominent and most
act-ve in the list. The number of stocks
which at any time got a point away from
last night'i- level in either direction was small,
however. The early decline In prices was as
sisted by London's disposition to **U American
stocks, which had established gains ranging
up to nearly a ooint in some of the American
storks twfore the opening. The New York
market cj>enp<l depressed in sympathy and
weaknefs was rather acute in some cases
notably in Â£t. Paul and Brooklyn Transit.
These rtecks later in the day led the advance
to tJ-.eir extreme range xu wide. St. Paul
rising aS from the loÂ»eÂ« and closing at the
top. while Rrooklyn Transit advanced an ex
treme 2%. This morning's decline, Â«comlng on
top of that of yerterday, invited some buying
to supi>ort prices, and the market hardened
promptly after the opening dip. The move
ment was exceedingly desultory and there
wcr* frequent reactions during the day. When
ever cr-t-oulatlve support was withdrawn, in
fact. r>rieÂ«*s were inclined to slip back. The
most notable movement of the Â«Iay was that
of the South west ems, which followed a show
of firmness for several days past In Kansds
end Texas jirfferrPd. There was also heavy
*bf.orrtion of the bonds of the St. Louis South
western ComiKinj* and the Missouri, Kansas
and Texas Comjiar.y this morning before the
rise In the stocks was Inaugurated. The ad
vance in the group reached FA In Missouri,
Kansas and Texas preferred. 2\^ In the com
mon ami about 2 points each in the St. Louis
Southwestern FtockÂ«. Wabash preferred, Texas
and Pacific and Missouri Pacific. There was
no news to explain the rise beyond the favor- !
alile showing of parninfts for several members
<A the group, which were published during the j
day anl which made them available for ma
r.lpulcticn by a speculative trade. There were
renewed rumors also of the lately talked of
consolidation of Southwestern roads. The eteej-.
Â«=tocks were Inclined to strength all day and '
show good net pains. Sugar showed decided
Improvement. Northern Pacific ro,"* a hartf
from the early depression and there were a
number of les* prominent railroads which
phowf-d good recoveries. The gains were not
well maintained and the closlnz was below
the best except in a few Â«ockÂ» < notably St
Paul and the Scuthwcsterns. Brooklyn Tran
eit was feverish all day and broke Rharply
after a considerable advance when the list
nf efflews elected by the stockholders was pub
lishc-1. a* it falleU to show the presence of the
Metropolitan Street Railway Interests in the
new directory which have been much promised
in fff.ll street cosslp. The most notable feat
rre of the day's market was the decided de
cline !n activity from the recent high level
and the necessity for persistent manipulation
*.o eecure a movement of prices. This Is the
natural result of the large elimination of snec
â¢jlative accounts from the market. The mar
ket has drifted flurini the week more and more
into professional hands. The preliminary fie
ure* of the week's movement of cash insures
annthpr pain to be shown In to-morrow's bank
statement, which probably will reach over
W.OOO.OOO on account of the direct express move
ment from the Interior and in spite of- the
gold export of J4.ono.oon. which almost entirely
wiped out the pains by the banks on Hub-
Treasury rperatlons.
The larre demand for St. Louis Southwestern
BÂ«conds was the inception of an active buying
movement of bonds of all the Gould South
westerns at notable advances In price. The

Failures for the week were 306 In the United
States, against 231 last year, and 46 in Can
ada, against 3S last year.
Staple products have moved within narrow
limits, little attention being given to wldely
varylng estimates . from Argentine or reportB
of damage In the Northwest through insuffi
cient enpw. Despite the advance in prices over
those prevailing a year, ago exports of wheat.
Including flour, from Atlantic ports for the
veek were 2,568.818 bushels, against 1,644,149
last year. . .
It is difficult to find encouraging features In
tht wool filtuatlffli. Sales for the week at the
chief Eastern cities were 1,000,000 pounds
s:naller than In the preceding week, and In
four weeks the aggregate is only 13,275,700
rounds, against 21.C04.700 last year. Not only
la there an utter absence of speculative opera
tions, but purchases by manufacturers are re
stricted to requirements for orders on hand.
Domestic quotations have not hardened in sym
pathy with, the better prices obtained at Lon
don, while a few sales are reported at mod
erate concessions. Hopes for the future, are
l:ased on indifference of dealers and growers
to sell at current prices, but present heavy
stocks will be augmented In a few months
by the. new clip. Â¦ â¢

NEW YORK. Jan. 25.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Â¦'Rarely has there been more business in staple
and In manufactured goods at practically un
changed prices than during the period since
November 1. This week seems to have marked
the climax of the enormous dealings at fig
ures- which have become familiar. The heavy
trade in pigiron at better prices, the larger
distribution of dry goods at a firmer range of
quotatlons*and the rush to secure prompt de
livery of boots and shoes Â¦ all indicate, that
business may have escaped one of those weary
readjustments of prices \ which have proved
often so trying In recent years. Jobbing trade
in the Interior is good and collections continue
excellent. After a week of quiet conditions,
partly due to uncertainty regarding competi
tion among leading' Interests, the iron and steel
industry has taken another long stride for
ward. The feature was enormous buying ot
pte at an advance to $13 25 at Pittsburg. This
midden activity In the raw material removed
fear that stocks might be accumulating- at
furnaces and gave some Idea of the heavy con
tracts for finished products taken by the mills.
In some directions there Is less foreign In
quiry, although an unusually heavy shipment
of billets went to Glasgow and exports of rails
have not ceased. Freight rates to the sea
coast are still considered excessive by manu
fncturers and there Is more inclination to push
domestic business on this account. Arbitra
tion Is expected to prevent suspension of work
at the furnaces, where a strike was threatened
on February 1.
' Further Improvement Is seen In footwear and
manufacturers are receiving ample orders.
Shipments from Â¦ Boston thus far amount - to
335,432 cases, against 3S0.963 in 1900. Leather
I.as been Irregular in demand, although prices
are steady. Hides at Chicago fluctuated widely,
with more grades sold at concessions than ad
vanced.
Silzrr a shade firmer. Exchange as before.
Wheat and Barley a fraction higher. .
Oats firm, Corn steady and Rye easy.
iMrgc arrivals of Volunteer Hay. Bran firm.
Beans still firm, but not very active.
Onions declined again. Potatoes and Vegetables steady. J
Poultry in over supply and weak. Game firm.
Gathered Eggs and store fytttcr lozver. Cheese unchanged.
Seven cars of Oranges auctioned. Five cars of Bananas arrived.
Price of Pacific brand of Raisins not yet fixed.
Provisions firm enough, but not over active.
Wool, Hops and Hides as previously quoted.
Meat market still firm at the old quotations.
Local stocks and bonds active.
Oil stocks continue brisk and firm.

vertiser's London financial cablegram gays:
The stock market here, to-day was inactive
and v heavy, in sympathy with many forced sales
of West Australian shares, an aftermath of the
recent Whltaker- Wright collapse. American
stocks seemed to have lost all animation. In
the early trading they were dull and lower with
a dragging tendency. * Later they hardened on
good buying of Denver and Rio Grande. No
reason, was given for the sudden interest in
these shares. " / â¢

BERKELEY, Jan. 23.â The athletic
agreement drawn up a year ago between
the University of California and Stanford
University will be discussed and probably
amended at a meeting of the Joint inter
collegiate committee to-morrow afternoon
In the Palace Hotel, San Francisco. At
this meeting Stanford will be represented
by David Brown, Fred Berry and A F
Cantwell. The Berkeley representatives
will be Everett Brown, Reno Hutchinson
and Ralnh Fisher.
The question of the place of holding the
annual varsity football game will form
one of the principal topics of discussion
According to the present agreement the
next game- will bo played at Berkeley, al
ternating each succeeding year with Palo
Alto. Although neither side is prepared
to offer an amendment both are desirous
of thorough discussion on this point. The
California men believe that for the present
at least the managements would suffer
great financial loss should the big game
be playeTl any other place than San Fran
cisco. Stanford will also ask that the sec
tion of the agreement which reads "after
1900 the annual university football games
shall be held on the second Saturday in
November" be ODened for discussion
There is still considerable doubt in both
universities about the practicability of
changing the date of the game from
Thanksgiving day.
Stanford will offer several amendments
She will ask that the mile walk be taken
from the list of track contests; that no
student of the Affiliated Colleges of the
State University be allowed to become a
member of the Berkeley team to comDete
against Stanford: that no student shall
represent his college In athletic events
more than four years; that no graduate
student be allowed to compete in any in

PRICE PRESENTS PETITION
FOB HIS REINSTATEMENT
Judge Hebbard . Hears Testimony
Bearing on His Disratement as
Lieutenant of Police.
Sergeant of Police William Price, ac
companied by his counsel, appeared before
Judge Hebbard yesterday to prosecute his
petition for a writ of mandate to compel
the Board of Police Commissioners to re
store him to his old rank of lieutenant of
police.
Former Secretary C. P. Wright and B.
L. Cadwalader, present secretary of the
board, testified as to the proceedings
taken at the time of Price's disratement
and by the board on his petition lor re
instatement.
Counsel for the defense in the action
urged that Price was not entitled to re
instatement for the reason that he was
never legally appointed a police lieuten
ant. It being contended that the act of the
old commission In passing a resolution
creating the office of lieutenant of police
was beyond Its legal powers and hence
the resolution is void.
"The world has made the Jew to-day
the most potent factor of civilization. By

has made the Jews more potent than If

"Why are Jews successful to-day? Is It

The world has done us many services,

Bessie McDonough is small of, stature
and not extraordinarily attractive In ap

her to believe that he was a single man.
After their marriage he began to abuse
her and would beat her. she says, on the
slightest provocation. She bore his ill
usage till two lights ago, when he gave
her an unmercilul beating and kicked her
after throwing her to the floor; She de
cided to leave him, and went to her sis
ters, telling ihim of her troubles. Her
eldest sister started an investigation, and
when she discovered yesterday morning
that .Lambert was a bigamist she notified
the police and his arrest followed.
Lambert takes his arrest coolly and does
not seem at all worried about the out
come. He throws aspersions upon his
first wife's character, and Is equally sar
castic In speaking: of the reputation of the
girl he led into a false marriage. He did
not deny beating her with his fists, but
denied kicking her. He says he does not
know where his first wife is, nor does he
care.

name.

OAKLAND, Jan 25. â Mayor, "Walter
G. Manuel; City Attorney, W. A.
Dow; City Engineer, M. K. Mil
ler; Treasurer. Felton Taylor;
Auditor. A. H. Breed.
These five nominations were made
by the Municipal League conven
tion this evening. It took less than ten
minutes to agree on the nominations after
the convention got to work, but it took
more than three hours to get to work, and
the convention did not get down to mak
ing nominations until after part of the
Fifth Ward delegation and scattering
delegates from one or two other wards
had walked out of the hall and refused
to participate.
The split came when the convention
went into executive session, as Is usual In
conventions of the Municipal League, arid
started to caucus upon candidates. A
proposition was made that the convention
nominate the five general officers to-night
and leave the ward officers to the future.
This brought out opposition from almost
the entire Fifth Ward delegation and
from a few members of other delegations,
but it was evident that the bulk ofv the
convention was willing to nominate at
once and had Us mind made up as to
candidates. John E. Farnum and H. A.
Powell were the chief advocates of Imme
diate procedure, while D. Edward Collins
and B. H. Chamberlain wanted the con
vention Co merely organize and then ad
journ.
When the convention returned to publtc
gaze once more the larger portion of the
Fifth Ward delegation, including D. Ed
ward Collins, A. T. Stewart, F. F. Bar-
"The established precwient of the Mu
nicipal League conventions has been to
organize and then adjourn, and In every
case to have candidates appear before the
convention In executive session for dis
cussion. The Fifth Ward has not held a
meeting and has not been together either
to consider ward or general nominations.
We have not had the opportunity to con
sult with candidates and we object to this
hurried and unusual method of procedure
rather than to individual candidates. We
came to the convention to-night expect
ing to consult, with the different candi
dates and then adjourn until next week
or at least until to-morrow night in order
to have an opportunity to form some opin
ion upon nominees. The Municipal League
should maintain its integrity and be dom
inated neither by the committee of twen
ty-eight nor the conviittee of twenty-one.
To offer fifteen minutes Is worse than to
have refused to recognize our claims at
all." â¢
bour. H. M. A. Miller, P. R. Thayer.
George T. Hawley, George W. McNear Jr.,
D. C. Borland and some others, and R. H.
Chamberlain of the. Seventh Ward, did
not accompany the main body.
The convention was at a loss what to
do for a while. Motions were made that
the entire convention once more go Into
executive session, and another that the
public be excluded from the room, which
motloa the marshal started to execute.
Then John E. Farnum Jumped to his feet
and moved that If the Fifth Ward.dele
gates wanted to consider candidates or do
anything else they be given fifteen min
utes In which to do It. C. S. Cushlng
made an effort to pour oil upon the
troubled waters, but with Indifferent suc
cess and those who had objected most
strenuously to the procedure left the con
vention hall.
Those who walked out made a statement
to-night as follows:
The Republican Convention will nomi
nate Anson Barstow for Mayor. James A.
Johnson for City Attorney: Fred C. Tur
ner. City Engineer, and George Gross.
Auditor.
The Republican Convention will meet to
morrow and an effort will be made to have
Gllpin placed on thai ticket, even though
GUptn denounced the committee of twen
ty-eight and cast hla lot with, the others
who did not brine his name before the
convention.
This is the first fleht of the kind that
has ever taken place in the league, which
has been noted for Its harmony. The de
feat of Gllpin for Treasurer contributed
In some measure to it.
The convention was called to order by
President Cary Howard of the league.
who was chosen chairman of the conven
tion. After the rollcall of the delegates
the secretary read the league platform.
which was unanimously adopted by the
convention. The platform declares for
economy and progress, demands that pub
lic improvements be carded out, points
out the record of the league on the water
front fight, declares for municipal owner
ship of the water supply ajsd advocates
a firm control over corporations. The
Republican City Central Committee Is de
nounced as given over to the agents of
"certain corporate powers."
After provision had been made for rill
ing vacancies In the ward delegations the
convention went into executive session
and then came the nght that ended in the
walk-out.
The work of the convention proceeded
after the withdrawal of the bolters. Sec
retary L. G. Burpee and John Fearn of
the Fifth Ward delegation each made
statements to-night that only seven mem
bers of the Fifth Ward delegation walked
out and that eight remained, and that
thus a majority of the delegation voted
with the convention.

that thpy saw no reason to alter the pre

show deeds proving their desire to comply
with the demands of the joint note before
any concessions would be granted.

dealing with the subject of the volun
teer? p.vA allowine them continuous ser
vice during the t'me they were out.
The bill introduced will not be the only
National Guard measure, nor the most
Important one. There is now one under
process of incubation which has for Kb
object the- abolition of the office and staff
of ma'or eeneral. centering the maior
srenerar? authority in the Governor and
leavlre- the adiutant peneral the execu
tive head of the puard. This measure
undoubtedly will receive the support of
the adiutant jreneral's office.
The affairs of the signal corps arc
given much attention in the bill, and
provision is made to put the corps on
a footing very much like that of the
regular army corps. There are a!s=o.ppv
eral provisions Insuring the rights and
exemptions for long service to those who
perved in the Spanish war. The raalor
per.eral Is allowed JlTOO a year, double Us
present headquarters allowance, and sani
tary corps are allowed $50 a month. where
at present they pet practically nothing.
Among the new officers are a com
mander, to be a member of the Gov
ernor's staff; a commander to take rank
next below the captain commanding; a
paymaster with the rank of lieutenant
commander: a passed assistant and Â»n
assistant paymaster with the rank of
ensign, and a surgeon, with the rank o*
lieutenant commander. The officers
dropped are a navigator and an ordnance
oSioer. whose duties are assigned to a
lieutenant, to be elected to the staff o*
the captain commanding. This is a net
gain of four officers, and all of them of
hish rar.k.

After Engineer Moore had been excused
Secretary Edward McGary of the water
company was called by the company's
attorneys to complete some unfinished
data regarding running expenses.
The witness began with July. 1900. Judge
Hayne at once objected and wanted to
know why they didn't take some of the
months before the trial began. A reason
appeared when the figures were given
Whereas, the expense of pumping at Al
varado prior to July. 1900. averaged in the
neighborhood of $1500. the figures of the
succeeding months' were:- Julv, $2273 *o*
August. J2fi27 01: September. J3SSS 22- Octo
ber. ?4T53 49; November, J26S5 99; Decem
ber, ?2328 53.
Judge Hayne protested against the use
of these data In. estimating the company's
running expenses. He pointed out that
nothing would be easier than to force up
the expenses since the beginning of the
SUlta - r- . 1 . - i Â¦ Â¦
"But you know that yrhen it comes to
carry out a plan there are always unfore
seen expenses?" hazarded the attorney.
"I have allowed 20 per cent of the gross
sum of my estimates as a contingent fund
to provide for all extra expenses," replied
the witness. "It is my Judgment that
that Is ample."
Asked whether his figures would not be
Inadequate to cover the expense of actual
construction work, the -ivitness said that
ajf an engineer he should feel lustiried in
advising a client on th<> strength of hla
estimates. ;
"I cannot undertake to Judge." he ex
plained, "what compensation a water
company would in equity be entitled to for
the loss of its business. But the value
of the plant itself depends on the cost of
duplication and on that alone."
"Yes," answered Engineer Moore, "it 1?.
The patrons may not be paying what it is
worth, but its worth Is tnere just the
same. The city of Santa Rosa charges
nothing for water, but the plant is worth
what it would cost to replace It. Of
course, the demand for the water is pre
supposed."
"But do you place no value on the good
will of a company, the chance of Its busi
ness increasing, and should not a com
pany be recompensed for its early losses?"
The witness thought this had nothing
to do with the subject on which he had
been called to testify, namely, the value
of the Contra Costa Company's water sys
tem. .
The court allowed the questions to go In,
although not strictly relevant, on the
ground that they would test the theory of
valuation upon which the witness had
based his calculations. The questions all
aimed at the admission of outside factors
as parts ol the basis of valuation for
water plants. Demand, rates and avail
ability of supply were all considered, but
the witness resisted every attempt to
move him from his original mode of com
putation. The water company's experts
based their calculations in a large meas
ure upon a supposed exclusive control of
the sources of supply by the Contra
Costa Company. This factor has so far
been absolutely ignored by the experts
called by the city to fix the value of the
company's plant.
"Supposing," said McCutchen, "sup
posing that a plant is yielding no income
at all. Now you don't mean to say that
It Is still worth what it would cost to re
produce it?" \
When the water rate case was called
this morning Attorney McCutchen began
on a new list of catch questions, which he
had devised for the undoing of Engineer
C. E. Moore, the city's expert, who. at
yesterday's hearing, placed a valuation of
less than three millions on' the Contra
Costa Compcny's system.

Martin C. Hassett. ettorney for the
Public Administrator. anJ William Cos
tello have been technically charged with
conspiracy In a suit filed yesterday by
Marj' F. Barron. af administratrix cf the
estate cf the late George E. Barron. In
the action the plair.^iSf charjres that Has.
tett and Costello unlawfully withheld pos
session of two policies on the life of the
deceasedâ one for S10.000. the other for
$4000 â collected the suae and converted
the money in th^ir own use.
In the complaint it is admitted that
pome time prior to Uarron'p death Cos
tello advanced him 53700. taking as se
curity for the loan Â«iji insurance policy on
his life fir 519.000. Later, it is alleged.
Barren intrusted Hat-sett with the poMcv
for $4000. Subsequently. In July of 1S37
shortly before Barren's death, it is
claimed he paid Costello the $3700 bor
rowed, together with accrued interest but
failed to secure the return of. the life in
surance policy given as security. After
Barren's death both policies were pre
sented by Costello for collection and were
honored, the sum of $13,893 23 being paid
thereon, the balance being withheld in
liquidation of unpaid premiums.
Mary F. Barren, who Is a daughter of
the deceased, now cJalrns that out of the
J4000 policy Hassett got J1KÂ»3 29 and Cos
tello $2000. and out of the division of the
fum collected on the $10,000 policy Has
*ett secured J3000. Costello J65O) and c
Third party, who is not named, the bal
anceâ$1500. The collection on the policies
and the division of the funds Mr?. Bar

and hence she prays that judgment for
double the sum of $13.K>3 2?. under the pen
alty statutes, be awarded her against the
defendants.

Wreckage Identified.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 25.â According to
British Columbia salmon shippers, there
seems to be no doubt that the salmon ship
believed to be lost was the British ship
Ardnamurchan. When the salmon cases
were washed ashore at Astoria a few
days ago the marks found on them were
compared by the shippers and the mani
fests of the different vessels traced, with
the result that It has beeti found that the
marks tally with those of salmon shipped
on the Ardnamurchan more than any
other vessel of the fleet, and the Vancou
ver Packing Company announces that its
salmon was on no other ship ot the five
that sailed. Â¦Â¦"-.

GIL.ROY, Jan. 25.â The "Watsonvllle Oil
Company, which has been boring for oil
below Sargents station for several minths,
recently changing the location on sugges

that there is 129 feet of oil in the pipes.

VANCOUVER, B.-C, Jan. 25.â Thomas
Klrkland Houlston, a professional swim
er of Sydney, X. S. "\V., was nearly torn
in halves by a shark the day before the
steamship Aorangi left for Vancouver.
He was out early in the morning, the
weather being very hot, and was leading
in a hastily arranged race with a number
of other young men. He swam a half
mile to a point and landed safely and im
mediately afterward started to return.
The greater part of the journey was ac
complished when Houlston suddenly gave
a shriek of pain. His companions were a
few yards .to one side and did not see ex
actly what occurred. People on shore,
however, heard his cry and saw him im
mediately sink. They procured a- boat
and recovered the body of the unfortun
ate man. They found the cause of his
cry was that his abdomen had been en
tirely torn away by a shark. So deep had
the fangs of the shark pierced that the
man's back and pelvic bones were visible.
Another swimmer lost a leg near the same
place a few days before.

SAN JOSE, Jan. 25.â The bogus Inter
view with Judge Bond, the president of
the Cured Fruit Association, published In
the New York Journal, of Commerce to
day and sent out by the Associated Press
and reproduced in the local papers, has
greatly annoyed the fruit growers of the
valley, and the headquarters was crowd
ed to-day by orchardlsts" asking for an
explanation. Early in the day a denial
of the interview was received from Judge
Bond and this was : shown to the grow
ers. He said he had not made the state
ments published in the Journal of Com
merce, nor had he had an Interview with
any of the papers. The statements were
ridiculous on their face, but, coming Just
at this time, when there is some dissatis
faction in the association, the article
caused a good deal of talk.
In the bogus Interview Judge Bond is
quoted as acknoivledgdlng that the first
campaign of the association had been a
failure, but that he was not discouraged
as to the ultimate result. The next sea
son's campaign was outlined as follows:
A low price to be named at the beginning
of the season, such price to be raised from
time to time as the demand justified; the
forcing of, the outside growers into the
association by reducing, if necessary, the
selling price below the cost of production.
This Judge Bond was quoted as saying he
believed could be Â¦ accomplished easily.
Other plans were the establishing of dis
tributing agents in the large cities and
the creating of a demand by advertising.
This all proved to be false, and the
officials .In charge of the headquarters
here say no such change will be made.
Judge Bond, who Is now in New Yorok,
will sail for Europe next Wednesday- to
investigate the foreign market and learn
how the foreign demand can be Increased.

FAKE INTERVIEW
CAUSES TROUBLE
"The Chamber of Commerce of Nome
and wealthy citizens have been raising
funds for the indigent sick and persons
have been conducting this charity in con
nection with the hospital. But wrecked
fortune hunters are too numerous and the
load too heavy for us. The nation's in
come from Alaska is $300,000 a year more
than the expenses for the Territory and
we ask only $15,000 to aid our charity."
"Eight out of every ten persons In
Nome," said Dr. Rininger, "are without
money enough to pay the most ordinary
expenses of living. Two-thirds of these
financially dilapidated, stranded persons
are sick. They, fall on the streets by the
score and having no frlend3 or home they
are usually taken Into the nearest doctor's
office. The physicians cannot keep them
there always and so the question arises
what to do with them. Many of them
have been taken to the hospital and thene
again the question arises what to do with
them, for It costs $4 or Jo a day to keep
them In the hospital.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.-Senator Ma
son Introduced a bill to-day to appropriate
$15,000 for the care of destitute sick people
in the hospital at Nome, Alaska. The
bill was referred to the Committee on
Territories, and to that body Dr. Rininger.

, * BATTLE roval occurred yester
>\ day morning between twenty em
i ZA\ ployes of the ban i rancisco Tele
j Sv phone Company and the stage
| warriors of the Tivoli Opera
house.
The field of conflict was in front of the
stage door of the Tivoli on Glasgrov.' street,
(which runs from Ellis to Eddy street.
i "Doc" I>eahy, manager of the Tivoli, Wi3
j returning from a morning cancer in the
j park, and on approaching the stabler
j which adjoin the stage door entrance of
the Tivoli he was surprised to find a
force of men engaged in digging a deep
hole ln the sidewalK directly in front ot
! the Btaee door of the theater.
Â¦ When Leahy asked the men what right
Â¦ they had to dig the hole he was told in
' forceful but inelegant language to hie
l himself to a warmer clime.
! "Doc" Leahy jumped from his honÂ»(Â»
{ and dashed into the theater sounding the
"call to arms."
A rehearsal was In progress at the tlmo
and, like trained soldiers, the forces of
the Tivoli responded to the "alarum." '
Ferris Hartman was putting a number
of girls through the Intiicacies of a fenc
ing duel and. armed cap-a-pie, the come
dian, with sword and dagger, led hia Am
azons to the fray. Property Master How
ard Morrison came forth with a muzzle
loading gun Â¦which did duty ln the Mexi
can War. Electrician Woolf armed him
self with a soldering iron, the stage hand.i
grabbed "braces," Treasurer Krause se
cured his six-shooter and his assistant.
Burt Mullen, donned his Gymnasium' suit
and boxing gloves.
"Doc" deployed his thesplan army and,
making a wide flank movement, surround
ed the enemy on all sides. ' Â¦ . â¢
The telephone men had excavated the
ground to a depth of eight feet and wern
lifting a 70-foot pole to place upright in
the hole.
"Surrender or we chaxze," cried "Doc"
Leahy as he mounted his horse. "Thl3
way for your ticketsâ I mean line upâ no,
I mean close up ranks." said- Treasurer
Krause, as the telephone men raised the
massive pole Into the air.
A crowd of spectators blocked tha
street and watched the combat and bet-*
were made that the Tivoli forces^would
capture the trenches aiid swarm over tha
kopje of excavated earth.
Some of the Tivoli orchestra at this
point played a stirring war march and
the Tlrolian warriors I swept forward.
Down came the huge telephone pole, nar
rowly missing the heads of the combat
ants; the thesplan army dashed over the
kopje; the trench was carried at the point
of Ferris Hartman's sword and the ama
zons lined up and cheered "Loc" Leahy,
while the telephone men fled in utter rour.
A courier was dispatched to Mrs. Ernest
ine Kreling, telling of the great victory
won on the borders of her realm.
"Doc" Leahy, in reporting the matter to
the police, stated that the sidewalk in
front of the stage door Is but four feet
wide and the pole which the telephone
men desired to . set up was sixteen inches
square and that ingress to the stage doo
would have been impossible .r.the po'i*Â»
had been erected. Leahy was acting in
the letter of the law. as he had learned be
fore the battle that the telephone com
pany had not secured a permit 'from th-?
Board of Public Works to erect the pole.
Later ln the day ' Assistant Manager
Olass of the telephone company called at
i u'e Tivoli and apologized for what hart
been done by his forces and a treaty of
peace was signed. The telephone pole will
not be erected in - front of the Tivoli's
stage door. Jt is lying, in the road as a
trophy -of victory. -

An Important reduction in freight rates
on barley will be made by the Southern
Pacific commencing _February_l. __A_rate
has been fixed of 50"cents per'MXTpoiinds
on barley in sacks in cars loaded to their
carrying capacity from California ter
minals and from" Port Costa to - the
Missouri River, Mississippi River anl
Chicago common points. This, however,
applies only to and from points named
and not from or to intermediate points.
The rate will expire March 31.
The rate at present is 70 cents per 100
pounds to the Missouri River; 75 cents to
the Mississippi River and 80 cents to Chi
cago. The. reduction is made ln order to
afford shippers an outlet for a large over
production, which has been accumulating
here for several seasons on account of the
Fcarcity of shipping accommodations. The
warehouses at Port Costa and other coast
points are badly congested and something
must be done to make room for next sea

the parlors of the church at midday.
In the afternoon Bishop Nichols opened
the proceedings with prayer and then

men ln church affairs. He paid a hlsh
tiibute to the late Queen Victoria, and
said that one of the brightest gems ln
her crown was the missionary achieve
ments during her reign.
The Bishop commended the inspired
work of the members of the auxiliary,
and urged them to continue on the same
lines. The details of work done by wo
men were used by God to mark the prog
ress of the church, he said. In closing
his address. Bishop Nichols eald that the
general convention of the church to be
held in this city next October will help
the church to teach people the power of
Christ. â¢
Miss Hawley delivered an address on

purpose was to wipe out ignorance. She
reviewed the work done In the classes
during the last year and hoped that all
would continue in spreading the gospel at
home and abroad. _^
Mrs. Bryan of Stockton spoke on "The
Junior Auxiliary." She suggested many
ways of making the classes attractive,
so that young girls might be brought into
membership. .
â¢Miss -Wade of Berkeley spoke on â¢'The
United Offering." She reviewed the suc-
of the offering since it was started
ln 1S83 to help maintain two missionaries
in the field. Every three years the offer
ing was made, and it has Increased until
in 1S98 the sum of $S5,000 was collected.
The offering this fall would be divided
amonK the Bishops for use by them in any
field they desired. _ Â¦
Rev. Mr. Â¦Gallway of Menlo Park gave

Continuing, he said there was room for

The people of the State of California, rep

fellows: "
Captain H. Payson and E. 8. Plllsbury
representing the Santa Fe Railroad and
ex-Governor James H. Budd, attorney for
the Harbor Commissioners, were present
at yesterday's meeting. Attorney PUls
bury addressed the board and stated that
the railroad company was willing to act
up to every clause ln the covenant. .He
laid special stress on the clause that binds
the road to expend not less than $50,000 an
nually for six years in the erection of a
seawall, a total â¢ expenditure of $300,000.
Mr. Pillsbury furttier expressed the opin
ion that the leasing of the property would
be advantageous to all concerned. He
concluded his remarks with the statement
that the bills that the Commissioners
were about to have submitted to them,
and which if they met with their ap
proval would be *sent to Sacramento for
the Legislature to act on. were heartily
indorsed by all the responsible commercial
bodies In this city.
Ex-Governor Budd then read the bills,
which are six in number. At the conclu
sion of the reading the bills were unani
mously adopted by the Commissioners.
The most important bill reads as follows:

The lease to the railroad was originally
signed in November, 1900, and the work
done yesterday was practically a ratifica
tion by. the board of Its action at that
time. . .

The cases were ta'jen up at 9 o'clock '
restetday morning. The first was that of i
Lee Nin. A Chinaman purporting to be a J
relative and to have lived with N'in in i
China pavo hfs testimony, and It was de- j
veloped that they spoke dialects of differ
ent districts, a proof that perjury had
been committed. The two other cases

cided that the applicants were not native
born Americans and ordered their depor

The originals of the foregoing- Â¦were sent |

noon to Judge de Haven's chambers, but j
the Judge had just left for home. He will i
be handed the documents to-day and may j
call upon Ageni A very to explain why he j
deceived the court by stating that the i
three Chinese petitioners were detained I
while their baggagTe was being searched.
Customs Surveyor Spear said yesterday
tliat the baggage of all Chinamen as well I
as other persons arriving here is searched I
immediately.
It is a significant coincidence with the
fact of the non-arrival of the Chinese in
court until the afternoon session that the
Hongkong Slant, the vessel on which the
Chinese would have been placed for de
portation, sailed at 2 o'clock on the after
noon cf Thursday. Had their cases been Â¦

What the

has to say of the new
Steinway
Upright
Pianos
The recognition of the Steinway dis-
coveries was instantaneous. To-day
the annual output of Steinway graftd
piar.os Is more than double that of all
the other manufacturers ln America
combined; while the Steinway upright.
j m whose construction the manufacture
i of both Europe and America Is based,
I has been carefully developed side by
j side with that of the Brand. The high-
i est priced upright made, it presents a
quality of tone absolutely unique, and
f=!nce the application of the grand plate
I by Mr. Zeipler has been rightly deslg-
I naled as the "prand piano in upright
form" because of its power, elasticity
and breadth of tone. While the pro-
cesses of StelnvÂ»-ay construction rest
on the firm foundation of scientific
I law, the constant improvement in de-
I tall never s-tops. and is the care of Mr.
Henry . Zeipler. grandson of Henry
Stefnway, the elder, who. true to the
principle laid down by Ruskin. is him-
self the possessor of powers that can
only Ixr developed through successive
perorations. . Hi? Improvements In the
construction of the upright piano, and
'lately ln all the Fizes of the grrand
piano. Ftamp him as the foremost of
his profession of to-day. â The New
