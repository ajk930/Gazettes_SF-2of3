I WILL lift the Public Administrator's
office out of the turntoil into which
It has been drawn throug* long: as-
sociation with the two probate de
partments of this court. The people/ of
San Francisco, after this has been accom- ,
pllshed, will know that there, are two
Judges upon this bench who have escaped .'
the mesh of scandal which has Â¦surrounded
this important office, the duties of which '
are to see to tbe safe and 'honest /distrl- '
buticn of the holdings Of the dead.to their'
lawful heirs." " , .
This remarkable statement was. made :
by Presiding Superior Judge . Frank H.
Dunne yesterday in Justification of his
action In refusing to further cases
in which the Public Administrator's of- â¢
flee was Involved to Probate Judges
James V. Coffey and James M. Troutt.
The application of the Public Adminis
trator for letters upon the estate of the
late Captain William Ward, commander
of the lost steamer Rio de JaneirOr was
assigned by Presiding Judge Dunne to
Judge Sloss' department for adjudication
and his petition for right to settle the
estate of the late John Harris was placed
for decision In the hands of Judge Mu
rasky, sitting in Department 2 of the Su
perior Court. . c ' " .
Says Public Cries for. a Change.
"Continuing, Judge rhinne said: "Myjac
tlon is in response to the public cry for a
change. I am tired . of constant com
plaints. -Like Presiding Judges before me,
I have been wearied by the frequent pro
tests of members of the bar and citizens
whose rights are or have been involved in
the probate departments of this court. I
have decided to make a change. â¢ I have
selected two Judges, whom I know to be
above reproach,' to handle the business of
the Public Administrator's office and If
they fall I will bear the responsibility, but
I do not look forward to any such result:

Judge Troutt, like Judge Coffeyj said
he- had.no. answer; to make; It would,

the ' departments . to which the pre

spared the' .unfortunate episodes that- had
arisen in other, department'sâ his included..
He pointed to the ; Piper case as an Illus
tration of unfortunate conditions that
may^bÂ© visited upon a' court at any time.
During his -absence from the city. Bald
Judge : Troutt, a will In favor of the natu
ral son of the deceased- was discovered.
Before he. returned to the city", the heirs
had compromised with - that natural : son
'and' a- threatened', controversy had been
;avoided.V,In ithis the ' court had ; hot been

drawn up by. Judge". Coffey, was then cas
ually^ referred to' by him as at least a
grain of support to his stand and- a small
measure of comfort! to. him in the defense
he.is now making.; But in conclusion
Judge Coffey said he would rather remain
silent;, to;. answer would be Â°to violate
his views upon the right of "one to answer

that the attorney who expends his ener^.

hardly consider them analogous. The

ARE CRUSHED
HAVANA, Feb. 27.â Clauses adopted by
the Cuban convention relating to rela
tions between the proposed Island repub
lic and the United " States will not be
satisfactory to the Washington Govern
ment.
. The scheme of relation was publicly ap
proved afternoon by the convention.
The preamble, which Is lengthy, sets
forth the receiving of letters from Gen
eral Wood outlining the wishes of the
Washington executive regarding, future
relations. It asserts the* -the convention
understood the desire of the executive
to be to bring about these specified rela
tions withÂ°.;the object of preserving- the
independence, of Cuba, and that the sug
gestion as to the naval stations was
made on those lines.
'"But this In itself." the preamble goes
on to say,, "would militate against the
Independence- which c both parties desire
to. preserve."
V Regarding the other conditions for pre
serving peace, such as raising loans, the
preamble points out that these are fully
covered; by the constitution, which docu
ment, in the opinion, of' the- convention,
amply protects independence, Including
liberal laws as to the rights of foreigners
and -individual rights. / -v -?
- Regarding the sanitary question, the
preamble declares that the future gov
ernment should make arrangements with
the LTnited States to protect that country
as well as Cuba.'
.' The convention clearly implies that its
action would not bind the future govern
ment, for the last part of the preamble
reads:
"The convention considers that -rela
tions might exist if the first government
MnCe.r the republic thinks it advieable.^s^
Appended are the resolutions adopted

"It is by no means enough that an offi
cer of the navy should be a capable mari
ner," John Paul Jone-Â» declared. "He
must be that, of course, but also a great
deal- more!' He should be as well a gen
tleman of liberal education, refined man
ners, punctilious courtesy and the nicest
sense of personal honor. He should not
only be able to express himself clearly ami
with force in his own language both with
tongue and pen. Tbut he should also b*
versed in French and Spanish. He must
meet and mix with his Inferiors of rank
In society ashore and on such occasions
; he must have the tact to be easy and gra

are present."

his recommendation, trait they Insist tirit

statements made /by John Paul Jones and

are almost identical with the views of

-CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Feb. 27.â There will
be no legislation In behalf of either Rear
Admiral Sampson or Rear Admiral Schlejr
at this session of Congress. The Senate
gave evidence of Us unwillingness to con
firm the nomination of these officers when
It declined to act upon them last night.'
but agreed tb the confirmation of all
other officers nominated by the President
for advancement. The refusal of the Sen
ate to confirm Sampson's and Schley's
nominations is . directly' traceable to the

We came In at half speed. The fog lifted
once and"* then, came down on us
The witness then stated that he was
not nervous on account of the ship com
ing into port In a fog. because he felt he
was under experienced men. , He stated
that he had never entered the bay under
similar circumstances. The witness ex
plained the working of the telegraph sig
nal to the engine room from the bridge
and told how he had been in charge of the
Instrument oh Friday morning last. Con
tinuing, Coghlan said:
A.â The, pilot gave the order to the
first offlceir to take the anchor up.
The captain, had not reappeared. Cap
tain Ward came on thÂ« bridge after
the anchor was up and the engines
had started. The captain took no
part in issuing orders. The pilot
seemed to be in command.
â¢Oâ Did the captain- interfere with the pilot?
â¢A.â I could see no Interference with : the
pilot by the captainl The pilot gave the orders
that morning. In my experience the pilot al
ways Issues the orders. Â¦ â¢ .,-Â¦.,
been at sea. since 1S89. I was In the navy
and also In the merchant marine. I have been
with the Pacific Mall Company for ,, fou^ ye '\ r J ! :
I was on watch below when the pilot Maraea
us last. Thursday evening. On Friday 1 1 came
on deck at 4 a. m. to relieve Third Officer
Holland. I called Captain Ward and also Pilot
Jordan. The- captain came on the bridge Â»Â»
minutes later. He looked around aw saw that
it was clear. We could see the Cliff House
lights plainly. Pilot Jordan had left word to 6*
called If the weather cleared. He came on
deck a few minutes before the captain, "hen
Jordan came on the bridge h* ordered the
anchor to be heaved. He gave the order to the
first officer,' who was forward. A few minutes
later Jordan ordered them, to stop heaving the
anchor and he went below. I presume he went
to see the captain. By this time the weath*r
had set In thick again. The pilot came bacR
In a few minutes alone.
Q.â What took place then?
The witness then described how ha was
trying to set the. wife of Consul Wildman
and her little boy. into a boat when the
Rio plunged down into the'bay. â¢.;
Q.â How long was it from the time the ship
struck until she sank? *
A. â About twenty minutes. . - . â... -. .
Q. â Could you not pet the passengers | in ' the
-boats In that time? v , .-. ,..-....
A.â We could . have done 'so. .but the passen
gers did not seem to realize the danger. There
was no panic The Chinese sailors were per
fectly orderly. I do not think a white crew
could have done any better 'than the Chinese
did. i It is not true that I said on Friday. that
neither the captain 'nor myself realized our
Q.â Did the captain order you to com* In?
A.â TeÂ», he did.
Q.â What did he say?
A.â He said, "Let her go ahead." He or
dered the anchor up the eecond time. He
stld, "It will clear up soon." i
Q.â Did you advise him as to the danger?
A.â He could see for himself how thick it
vuf. All I could do was to act as adviser. I
tcld him tt was not safÂ«. I could not go con
trary to Ms order*. ; I never saw such a heavy
current. â¢ >i - ', -" â¢ *
, q.â Do you consider yourself responsible for
the 'laws' of the ship? â¢ ' â¢
A.â No, I do not. I -did then what I have
dene" a hundred times before outside of the
eccentric current. *
Pilot Jordan then explained that there
was no law forbidding; . a ship, being
brought Into port in a fog, and that it
was a matter of Judgment.
At this point a. Juror questioned the wit
ness as to who gave the various orders for
the anchor to be Hoisted, and Coroner Le
land said: _ _ ...,;.,, '
It seems there was a conflict'- of authority.
You say you first ordered the chain "hauled In.
Then you â¢ say Â« yon ; ordered it stopped. Then
you tell 'us the captain- ordered the anchor
hoisted. ',
Pilot Jordanâ The captain ordered the anchor
up and .the thtp to go ahead . when .the fog
(f.me down:' .' Â£*,*-*â¢
The witness then explained the manner
of paying a pilot and told how all the
earnings of the pilots went into one fund
and was divided. . A ship like the Rio paid
$12U for pilotage.'' In reply to questions
the witness further said: -
If we had been going faster we would have
cvercome the tide. There is no ! way of es
timating * current when you cannot see It.'
I did not know of the strong current until we
struck. Information is only given to pilots
ah to high and low water."' After the ship
rtruck I told the captain I feared she would
drift off the rocks. I told him to blow the
danger signal. He blew a long, long blast.' -
Q.â Would that long, long blast be recognlxod
or the. coast as a danger signal? . *
A.â Certainly it would. - . '
Q.â %Vas 1t different from- the others?
, A. â Yes, .we had been blowing ordinary fog
signal*.' They 'lasted as -long as you- could
count* six", or,' seven. All* hands â¢ went >to their
ptatlons -.when' the . danger signal. blew. â¢. It
lapted-a long time. -We started to clear thÂ«
boats. Â¦: t Bverythlng was" orderly. Every man
went, to his station..- I. roused, the passengers
and told them to hurry up. I went around the
deck/ while the whistle was blowing. I, helped
to' lower a boat.
Q. â How ' do you - explain that a - boat got
away with Chinese and no women or children?
A.â The ship went down as we were trying
to get them in. - . ;
A. â Because ho was late.
' Q.â What argument did he use to force you
to come in .against your better Judgment? ,-.
A.â He did not u*e. any arguments. I saw
hÂ« was anxious to get in. ,
Pilot Jordan' then explained that ship
owners pay the pilot for services rendered.
and that a pilot was not paid extra to
bring a Â»hip Into port quickly. He said
that there was no reason for a pilot to i
proceed against his better Judgment ex
cept an anxiety to pjease his employers.
Pilot Jordan clung to .his testimony that
all he desired to do In bringing a vessel In
quickly was to please the owners of the
ship. .
Q.â 'Why was the captain anxious?
. Q.r-If you think it is not. altogether
safe to bring a vessel into port in a
log why did you jeopardize the lives
and property of the Bib? . ., â¢
..-A. â Well, the captain -was anxious
to come in. V ' â¢ . â¢ . / .
-j râ -. ; â r â . .â¢ . ,
It Is misleading.. It "cannot be heard at any
diftance. . â¢
Q. (By a Juror)â Were your whistles going
as you came In? â¢ ' -
A.â Ye*, every half-minute. .
Q.â *>' r hat Is your experience as a pilot?
A.-^I have served In this harbor for eleven
years. â¢ In 1873 I commanded a coastwise ves
*el and remained commander for several year*.
I commanded thk "Wellington for two years
and have l?ad other ships. â¢ I alwaj'* brnught
Bay own vessels Into port. I passed the pilot's
examination. . .
â¢Â¦g^ Do you consider It safe to come Into
prrt In a fog? Do pilots think It safe to do
thlfc if guided by the whistle*? Do .you think
it *afe? .-'.. ' â¢
â¢A.-^Yes. I think so. 'Â¦ . t
Q.â Do you think. so absolutely?
.'A.â Well,- not. altogether eafe. Â¦ â¢ ' /: .
When Pilot Jordan came .ashore last
Friday he stated in positive, terms, -while
being interviewed at the Mail Dock, that
the ship had strucic on Mile Rock.. The
Mall Company or'y located the wreck on
Tuesday morning after the life-savers, un
der Camain Hodgnon, located the wreck
on Sunday. ConMnulnp, Pilot Jordan 8ald:
Â¦ Tht only way I can account for the accident
was the *wlrl of'the tide from Lime Point to
Fort Point and the fog which prevented us
seeing th* current on, the water.. .
Q.â Ton blame the "current, then? "
â¢ A.â Entirely. ' . Â¦ '> . ' - '
Q.â Do you blame an>thing else?
JLr- Yea," the imperfect whistle at Fort Point
Go on.
I knew I was past Mile Rock by the range
cf the whUtles. I tried to get an echo from
my whistle from Point rMablo. but I got- none.'
I then headed N. tt. E. for Lime Point In
crdtr to cut off the heavy tide. Captain Ward
and myself concluded that we were going
about four knotÂ»-o\-er the ground, after allow
ing for the current. ' We were utlll Â«tecrtng
by the whlftles. The wind was S. E. and I
couia hear Llr;e Point whlstlÂ« distinctly.. Part
of the crew wa* on deck. Seme of the men
Â¦were ChlnÂ»*e anfl some were white. Captain
Ward was op the bridge with me and the first
and recond officer* were also there. 1 asked
First Officer Johnron to llÂ«tcn on the etar
bcard Â«lde lor tlÂ»e Fort Point bell. 1 felt per
fectly confident of my position at the time, it
confident aa if I was walking up the etrcei.
I went to Johnson every fÂ«-w minutes .to ask
him If he had heard the bell, and he told me
no each time: Then we rtni'Vk .1 knew it
tvas en -Fort Point because I h-. -.rd . the ' bell
then' and n* the light.- : â¢Â¦-' ' . â¢
Coroner Lelandâ If you knew at that time

CictinR ctatementa have been made as -to the
actual place where Â¦ the ship grounded. Did

on Mile Rock?
X t-aJd no>uch thing.' I knew exactly. where
we struck, tr.d when I went out yesterday in
the tug I located the wreck In fire minute*.
. Q.â Tell tie irnat harpened then.. .
X âWo came on at half Fpeed. I started on
a northeast course and had L,lme Point straight
ahead and was running by the whistle on a
Â»orth?ast bearing. .-.
Q.âDo you usually take your bearings by the
6ound of whistle*? '.- . . _-.
. A.â Yes. when I know where I am.
A.â I told him that we yould not
go in. I said I would wait till day
iight.
Q.â What reply did Captain 'Ward
make to you then?
. A.â He said that it always cleared
at daylight and that we should go in.

again. I saw no lighU until jarÂ© Â¦truck the
rock.' ,1 heard the fcg whistles going on. shore.
Ko "ouijdlngavwere taken as we' went In. I
saw the white light on Fort Point: about 'two
minutes ixlcit we Â«truck- When we struck
tlie car tain g-ve two long blasts en the whis
tla to t.binulrn ship. This signal called every
man to his pout. J They all responded promptly.
I went to the life . rafts to untlo.them. but
found that some one had already donÂ« thlÂ«.
I saw threÂ« boats on the starboard .side being
lowered. 'The other , boats forward could not
be lowered. .The bows of, the ship were down
in the water, and a man could not reach the*
boats. Â¦ Four minutes after striking - the Â¦ ship
was settling- rapidly. I* helped , to get two
boats> oft*. Â¦ They were lowered in good order.
The crew acted in good style-. - They obeyed
orders and kept at thalr posts. The ship. went
down in ten minutes after striking. I bad my
boat ever in less than five mlnutM.. .'After.
Captalr Ward gave. the danger signal he tied
thai whistle Â¦ Â£ord . down. I tied Â¦ the cord of
the 'other whistle ', down, and both kept -blow-
Ing until > the steam , was exhausted. Any one
on shore would know that It was a dt*i??r
signal. -We were close in to Fort -Point light,
and the whistles must have been heard at the
Presidio. No soundings were taken ' as we
came- - In. though all the apparatus was - near
the chains. - 1 think the ship would have been
delayed by taking 'soundings. When !â¢ got

a captain If his ship is delayed. There Is no

Q.â Why do you employ Chinese? ; Â¦Â¦ ; Â¦ Â¦*
Â¦Â¦ . A.â Because without them we. would have to
e> out of business. Other - companies employ
them and we could not pay high Wages /and
compete with these, companies. sWe Â¦ pay a

tailor gets S40 a month and board. â¢â¢

the benefit of his wife's health. The
first news he had of his relatives came
five years ago. when a circus man ln
fomed him of the wealth of his. brothers

No. 36, making the office of State Printer
appointive instead i oÂ£ elective, caused . a
stir to-day by disappearing. It has passed
the Senate and had been referred to the
Committee on Public Printing in the As
sembly. On Thursday evening last a del
egation from, the Federated Trades and
from the State Printing Office came before
the Assembly committee to support tb.3
biJl and last evening Kelley of Aiameda
believed he had reported the bill back fa
vorably, but Instead It had been laid oa
Johnson's desk with a number of ether
bills, and It was found tucked away hi
one of the plgeon-bol<*s there.
In the meantime Loivltt introduced a
similar bill in the Senate under suspen
sion of the constitutlonr.l provision, as the
time for. introducing bills had passed.
Then, in the afternoon, bv unanimous
vote, the Â¦constitution was suspended
again and. the bill was read the second an.l
third time and was Â» Â»nt over to the As
sembly. About thaf.iine the original bill
was found and was sor.t in with a favor
able report, so Leavltt will withdraw his
later measure. R was .thought until the
bill was found that it had been stolen.

club, is now the possessor of the hand
some silver cup offered by H. ' V. Rams

battle royal. James took the first game
and Cartwright evened maters by winning
the second. Cartwright took the lead
and scored 16 points to James': 7.' Then
James pulled . himself together, overcame
tho big lead and won out. The. score was
James' 21â 18â 21 to Cartwright's 19â21â19.
:, The eof t ball tournament then opened,
and Powers (40) defeated Clough (40) by
a score of 40â8. Bogan (45) then defeated
Hoffman (45>- In- a masterly fashion. He
rolled up a score of 40 to Hoffman's 11.
\ Powers and Bogan will now play for
ilrst place in their class. 'They are sched
uled to meet to-morrow evening. To gain
first place in the tournament .the contest
ants must win two of three games.

be from the grounds, -any player guilty
of using: improper language to another
player, captain, manager or spectator.

A batsman may not henceforth take his

will count as a ball against the pitcher.
Article 54 of the constitution- was
amended to read that the- board of direc

would not begin the season. â¢ ; â¢ . '-' -.
President Young to-day announced that
the league had granted -all the players'
demands. The players . have agreed to
sign league contracts under pain of sus
pension. The suspension, however, is only
operative until the players' organization
can meet as a body and act on the mat
ter. As a matter of fact, the agreement
signed by President Zimmer amounts to
nothing more thanan expression of good
will toward the National League as
against Ben Johnson's ; organization.
Whether the players ratify Zlmmer's
agreement or not the concessions made by
the league will hold good.
Rule No. 3, defining the position of thÂ«
catcher's lines, was altered so ihat the

There is trouble brewing in the ranks
of the San Francisco Turn Verein. Cer
tain members of that exclusive organiza
tion are In a turbulent mood and a good
natured teacher of gymnastics is in dan
ger of decapitation. The old adage that
"a woman is at the bottom of it" is more
than true in this instance. In fact, tea
prepossessing maids are accountable for
an outburst of indignation among th3
male members of the organization.
On Thursday evening last the members
of the San Francisco Turn Verein gave a
masquerade ball in their hall at 323 Turk
Street. It was an annual event and the
members and their friends attended in
large numbers. Prizes were awarded to
those who wore the mest handsome cos
tumes and best sustained the character^
represented by them. A prize of $29 was
also presented by the committee to the
group of members that cave the best ex
hibition on the stage. Ten young women
secured this coveted prize and the cha
grin of their maJe competitors was great.
It seems that It is the custom for the
male athletes of the verein to carry off
this prize. The monev has" usually been
expended for foaming beakers or in buy-
Ing a repast for the victors. Certain mem
bers have for many years successfully
competed and expected to win as usual
last Thusday night. They were foiled,
however. The fair 'members of the organ
ization put their pretty heads together
and at a special meeting vowed they
would outdo the men. Profound secrecy
was demanded and, strange to relate, the
ladles maintained that secrecy. At an
other special meeting it was decided that
the fair conspirators should go to the
ball a* "Pierrots" and Professor Hans
Goetz was appealed to to teach them a
little dance that would bei in harmony
with their pink and black satin costumes.
Within a week the Misses Minnie and
Clara Trost, Julie and Alice Kalmuk,
Hattle Korn, Dora Linbaugh, Laura Sieff.
Etta and Edie Plegemann, Annie Berg
man, Jos in Simmen and Therese Freder
icks were able to pirouette with the grace
of coryphees.
That the men were not Idle Is evidenced
by the preparations they made. Messrs.
Louis Rapp, Alfred Furth. Fred Miller.
George Mass and Ernest Fleischer, felt
certain they would carry off the prize.
They expended $40 In buying costumes.
They are all powerfully built men and
each believes himself to be patterned after
the mold of the Apollo Belvedere. They
therefore presented a tableau in which
they appeared as Grecian gladiators.
Their heaving muscles stood out In beauti
ful relief and were accentuated by the re
fulgent rays of a calcium handled by an
expert. But they did not win. When the
ten young ladles tripped on Â¦ the stage
they were greeted with thunderous'ap
plause and when they finished their grace
ful dance they were given an ovation and
also the prize.

The attaches of -the City and. County
Hospital were notified lato yesterday
afternoon that a man had been thrown
from the San Jose train which passes the
hospital about . 6:30. An ambulance was
sent out and the unfortunate man, who
was found to bo severely Injured, was
brought to the hospital.
Everything possible was done for him,
butc despite the efforts of the physicians
he succumbed to his injuries, dying about
midnights When tha hospital ambulance
arrived at the corner of Twentieth â¢ and

dent, the driver was told, by a woman
who refused to give her name that "she
saw the man fall from the train as the
carÂ«;were rounding a curve, and that she
thought Bbe recognized : him as Fred
Behn, a hotel keener of Mayfleld.
The woman said she did not care to
have her name mentioned In connection
with the affair and also refused to give
her address. -

FALLING FROM THAIN
Vain, with Winnie/ O'Connor at the
wheel, came into port in fair-weather
Bailing, leaving the first choice, Torslda,
and The Singer to get the show and place
money. The Singer was carried out to the
front by Henry and led even when the
paddock was reached, but then O'Connor
whipped up and left The Singer and Tor
sida rolling In the wake. This was over
the mile route.
The sixth race wont to Rolling Boer, a
strong favorite, Henry on. top. Some who
thought the distance too short for the
Boer fancied the second choice. Raveling,
who got the place. At the start Rio de
Altar took the lead, with Raveling close
behind. At the stretch the Boer, began
to steam, up and won handily.
. "Winnie O'Connor rode in all six races,
piloting three winners. Straight Shot, I*e
pal Maxim and Vain: two for plate. St.
Cuthbert and Raveling, and one for show,
Tuthill. s,-
T'.is race, the third on the card, was
four-cornered. Janice and Autumn being
the other entries. Autumn, on account of
recent- performances, was considered the
outsider, hut showed *up In this engage
ment as. a etanch warrior of the track.
Henry had the mount and at the start he
took Autumn out to the front. The
humping for the first eighth mile was ex
ecrable, all but Autumn figuring. Ad
vance Guard drew up in the rear and until
the last turn held no better position. Then
Burns began driving and the race was a
hot one down the stretch, all three jock
eys driving hard when they passed under
the wire. Autumn got the place and Tut
hHl the show.
Winnie O'Connor took up the winning
streak yesterday where he left off on
Tuesday. In the. llrst race he piloted
Straight Shot. 7 to 1. for first money over
six and a half furlongs, for three-year
old' maidens. Introductory 20 - to - 1 when
the betting opened, and 10 to 1 at the
close, was ridden by Woods and all hut
captured the purse. Introductor led all
the way to the paddock and then a hot
race- began between Straight Shot, Intro
ductor and The Gaffir. Straight Shot rang
the bell, Introductor taking second place
and The Gaffir getting the show. Aphro
dis, the favorite, was lost In Greek.
Legal Maxim, O'Connor up, was a pro
hibitive favorite in four furlongs race and
rightly so. . When Winnie let loose there
was nothing to the race but Anna B, now
under the changed name of Snowberry,
at 109 to 1, andMuslque, at 15 to 1, got the
place and show. ;
J saline, with Henry up, won, the fourth
race, selling, six furlongs, in easy style.
Theory was th*Â» favorite and at the start
Bums b<?gan to j?o out in front. Henry
tacked on and at the turn into the 3tretch
passed and walked away from the fa
vorite.
by Advance Guard. Carruthers &
Shields' great four-year-old tore off a full
second of the 1:45^4 time that stood as the
Tanforan figure. Tommy Burns sieered
the winner, which opened a favorite bin
closed second choice, Tuthill, O'Connor
up, getting the play in the ring.
THE feature of the racing at Tan
foran yesterday was the destruc
tion of the track record over the
one mile and seventy yards route
If Johnny Bullman, the jockey, can ob
tain the consent of Senator McCarren of
New York, his present employer, he will
pilot Garry Hermann In both the Mem
phis and Kentucky Derbies. The crack
rider is daily awaiting an answer from
the .New York turfman..

E. Landsberg, the well-known horse
man, will take a handy string of horses
over the Montana and Colorado circuits
the coming summer. The Elk and several
other bread winners will be members of
the string.
Track lJotes.
Alleviate, also from the Schulte stable,
took the closing six furlong spin. The
mare went to the post an even money
chance and, leading throughout, came In
winner, -five lengths in advance of Mod
wena.; Alaria, k 10 to 1 shot, ran third.
Beaten a head for the two-year-old
dash, Joe Tague's entry, Maydine, in the
mile selling run, met with more success.
The'mare went to 7 to 1, and then won all
the way. One length back Expedient, the
favorite, came from far back, leading out
Montallade for the place. ' : .
After looking at his several races the
smart ones have pronounced St. Simonian
a "dog."- The big fellow closed a favorite
for the mile and a sixteenth run, and,
showing no speed, ran third. The going
exactly suited Lena, which had J. Ransch
In the saddle, and the old mare disposed
of Joe Ripley in a common canter.
With, the talent divided as to whether
Miss Rowena or Doublet would win the
five and a half furlong run, second on the
card, Tame Irishman went out and did the
act. The queerly named Celtic horse had
a world of speed and, outfootlng Doublet,
earned the decision by a length. Mounce,
astride Miss Rowena, rode a poor race,
finishing a close third.
Even If jockeys are at a premium the
judges at Oakland track, as well as at
Tanforan, ehodld inform these exalted
stable boys that they are not the whole
thing. They may illuminate the most fre
quented paths of the tenderloin, but
should be taught that they do not dom
inate the powers that bo. in racing. After
taking: advantage of the start, Henry
Shieius on Rosewar, in the two-year-old
event, carried out the favorite, Flora Po
mona, and won by a neck. Shields' horse
manship was plainly open to criticism â
and at the leist he should have been
fined.
Mounce, who seems to have fallen Into a
lazy groove, made a poor showing with
Satin Coat.
Â¦ Racing began with a sprint over the
Futurity.- course, , which was captured
easily by. Parsifal, a 4% to 1 chance, rid
den by t Domlnlck. Diderot, the 7 to 10
choice, was weakly handled by Ruiz, fin
ishing second, six lengths before Marcy.
â¢ ;. . Mies Rowena, Flora Pomona, St.
Slmonian and Expedient all went to the
post well backed and failed utterly to up
hold the confidence reposed In them. -;No
fault could be found with the attendance,
which' was quite' up to the average, "and
the betting was lively. *}.; o : .. "

WASHINGTON. Feb. ?7. 1501.
MTASHINGTOX. Feb. 27.â Veteran sol
diers of the Spanish and Civil wars have
officially declined to participate in the in
augural parade on March 4. The decision
affects organizations In the Grand Army
of the Republic, the Union Veterans'
Union and the Spanish War Veterans.
The dissatisfaction of the veterans with
the place assigned them in the parade is
responsible for to-day's action. It was
their wish to act as the' personal escort
to the President. Grand Marshal Greene,
on the contrary, assigned them to a posi
tion in the line ahead of the civic organi
zations and following the National Guard.
General Daniel Sickles to-day notified
General Greene that the veterans had de
clined to. participate in the parade, and
he tendered his resignation as marshal of
the veteran division. Â°
Decline Positively to. Take
Part jn the Inaugural
Procession.

The most notable speech of the day was
delivered by Bacon of Georgia. He had
been thoroughly aroused by reports that
the Democratic members had been in
duced bv questionable means to withdraw
their opposition- to -the proposed legisla
tion, and he passionately branded as a
libel upon honorable men and Senators
any and all such statements. Personally,
he declared, he would defeat the amen-.l
ment if he could, although he realized the
majority woulS have to accept the respon
sibility for. them. His arraignment of the
amendment for "coercing" Congress Into
onactii:g such provisions In the closing
hours of the session was sensationallv
fierce, and he declared that the only pos
sible object of such action was that the
"plunderers and vultures" might have an
opportunity to prey upon the prostrate
land of the Filipinos. Senator Turner of

nounclng the proposed legislation.
Early In the evening the voting began
on. the minor amendments to the meas
ure. All of them were offered by Demo
cratic Senators and all of them were voted
down by heavy majorities.
Not since the enactment of the resoiu-"
tions declaring a' stato of war* .to exist be
tween the^ United- States 'and â¢ Spain -has
there been such an avalanche of passion
ate oratory as ,the\ Senate' listened to to
day. Throughout tjie cession the army ap
propriation bill was under discussion tha
controverted questions being the Spooner
Philippine amendment and- the Platt
Cuban amendment." Curiously enough the
debate was confined. entirely 'to the Demo
cratic side of- the chamber, with one ex
ception. Both amendments were de
nounced as -vicious and pernicious- legis

last formal action from this end was an
advice to Ernbassador Choate reminding
him that but little time remained for the
ratification- of the treaty, which would
die en the 4th of March. He was not spe

a-cvarices for an extension of tha time al-
Icwed for tte ratification of the treaty.
ar.d It is not known that anything has
been done In this direction by either side.
The Impression is deepening to the
pcint of conviction among officials hera
that no action will be taken upon the
treaty, or rather upon the Senate amend
ments by the British Government before
Congress adjourns. But it would not sur
prise them if at a later date some over
t-res came, perhaps in the shape of the

means, uslr.g the old treaty as a basis,

- To from backache, is' a: luxury
that many women hardly ever realize.
"It seeins.as if my back would break,"
is an expression often heard. .' Â¦ ; /
Of course there are many, other causes
for backache besides pelvic catarrh, but
this :ig by far. the mos,t frequent cause.
Thebackache becomes, to such women a
sort'of physiological barometer, by whicJi
they can tell the approach of a storm, or
the recurrence of a menstrual period.- "
The large muscles of the back have be-
come so weakened by the exhaustive
drain, that instead of sustaining the deli-
cate mechanism of the woman's anatomy
they remain loose and flabby, serving only
as the seat of myalgia or neuralgia, or
else muscular . rheumatism. Ache and
pain seems to be â¢ the only use such
muscles are eood for.

II.â Food in Its Relations to Health and Longevity. ;..;â¢.-Â¦ 'â¢ â¢
, The relation 'which food bears to", the,
health of . the individual .has been recog
nized as the. most important by physicians
and hygienists from the remotest times.
The disorders ; and .diseases sfrising from
impure food or pure food improperly ad
ministered do much to swell fhe sum of
human ailments and distress.
We "are all aware of the Intimate rela
tions which food bears to growth and de
velopment. These relations are well.un
derstood by the growers of farm animals.
The science pf feeding, the animals of the
farm has been so Improved within the last
fifty years as to be almost exact. Different^
types of animals aPe developed for Q dlff er Â¦Â»
ent purposes, almost solely by variations
of food.' ;"-;Â¦â¢ ;/; Â¦- "â¢. .. * ;/ :
Of all .the valuable animals the feeding
of man alone seems to have been neglect
ed.; 1 It Is evident, in order to secure suc
cess In "any profession of life, that : not
only should the child inherit from his
parents natural abilities and aptitudes for
his profession; but also should, from the
time of infancy/be subjected to a regimen
of food, exercise and culture suited: to the
profession which he is to follow, j
The history ot nations has shown that
those which hare been best fed have been,
upon the whole, the strongest, bravest
and most speedily developed. To appre
ciate this it is only necessary to compare
those nations that have been well fed lor
centuries with those that have, always
had inferior or deficient nutrition. Among
the older well-fed nations England stands
rrt-emlnent. There is much, doubtless, in
olood and heradity. Â¦ People are at birth
what their ancestors have made them, bait
food, acting through thousands and thou
sands of years, made their ancestors what'
they were. So the English people, inhab
iting a group of small ialands. insufficient
in extent to produce food even for its own
dwellers, are better fed than any of the
other peoples of the world. The desire for
food, as much as for conquest, has sent
out English shlDs to all nations and to all
quarters of the world to gather in corn as
well ad coin.
Chief Factor in Prolonging life. l /
- The study of foods in their relation to
national and individual development is in
timately associated with the study of
longevity. It requires no argument' to
show that the kind of food, which is best
suited to the full development of all the
powers of the individual,, and thus to all
the powers of the nation, is also the kind
.which tfan prolong life. At the commence
ment of the twentieth century It is em
inently, proper that the scientific relations
of food to longevity should be briefly set
fortlu -. " <=,;,;**.Â« â¢ f â¢
\o\ am of. the opinion that every person
will admit that among the factors which
tend to prolong human life food is^the
most lmportant.tlt j is* a well-known prin
ciple In epidemics and in contagious dis
eases that they spread most rapidly and
do their most deadly work among thoBe
portions of the community which are
poorly nourished. When an epidemic or
a contagious disease attacks a community
.which is well nourished it discovers in
dividuals in whose systems the germ*, of
disease do not readily find a lodgment,
and if a lodgment be- found the battle
which tttese 0 disease germs w'age with the
vital forces usually ends in the victory of
the latter. 0 Therefore, first, of all, good
nutrltlon-is requisite to secure a nation as
; free "as possible, from the dangers of epi
demic and contagious 'disease. ' ' .
> Tho role of food In the development of
the individual and tJy? nation is, therefore,
of incontestable value. In fact, it- is the
chief point of that, environment "whlen
tends to the highest evolution of the Indi
vidual and national character. Therefore,
the purity of c food becomes of -the most
vital importance.- That = the /individual
6hbuld have his health placed in Jeopardy
by eating impure food" is unpardonable
when it Is possible to avoid It. j For this
reason%the manufacture of and traffic In
adulterated foods are an-offense against
public'morality ae well as a danger'to tho
public health. Â» s ;=i --" Â°^ â.-? Â» - Â°'-''2<
3 "Harmless Food Preservative. '
:' It is possible that there may bfe some
fprms of adulterated foods which are not
injurious to health,, 0 but they are, never
theless, fraudulent, and thus injure the
reputation for honesty and J straightfor
wardness which Is- so valuable both to
the individual and the community.
Â° The best way, perhaps; to .illustrate the
danger of food . adulteration is to cite
some of the common examples. The most
Objectionable and the most commonly
practiced form of adulteration is the in-"
-discriminate use of preservatives. Many,
of our common foods are of a perishable
nature and require either to be used im
mediately after preparation or else to be
preserved in sdme way which will pre
vent notable .decay.' There are' perfectly
harmless methods of "preventing the de
cay of foods, because, all decay Is due to
a species, of fermentation, 0 or, in other
words; the action of certain minute or
ganisms which produce\changes in the
structure of foods.- These changes belong
tOjthat claBS'of metamorphoses which we
designate by the general term of fer
mentation: The" exclusion of these organ
isms from an "article of food or their de
struction when present will preserve the
substance from decay. Â» :% %
Â£ By fat the best method of destroying
, these organisms Is by, the application of
heat, a practice whlch'Is illustrated on an
immense scale, c commercially. In the pro
duction of canned foods, consisting of
fruits, vegetables and meats. The. prin
ciple upon which the destruction of these
organisms Is based Is a simple one and
consists in exposing the 'material after It
is placed in th^ receptacle or can,', to the
action of heat at a temperature sufficient
to destroy the vitality ,of the organisms
/which are present and also the spores
which they may; have . produced. When
this temperature is reached the package
is hermetically, sealed by solder or other
wise, which prevents the Ingress of living
germs from the air. The oM notion that
the preservation of food was due to the
exclusion of air was Â¦ an erroneous one,
since sterilized air has no tendency to pro
duce decay. " , Â¦ j
Unfortunately for the health of our peo
ple, this process Is -somewhat expensive
and with some kinds of food products is
dittitfult of application, as the tempera
ture required changes to a certain extent
the texture And appearance of the pred
ucts and renders them less agreeable .to
'ttje. eyo.and more' difficult of sale.*. ; "
Action of Chemical â¢ Preser vatives. ' r
o The food preserver" in this case has had
recour.se to -the, art of chemistry.- and has
demanded of.it substances which, prevent
decay, and at the same time preserve tjie
appearance and character of the food un
changed. For jthls end a large number of
preservatives nas o bcen prepared and used.
THe principle of the action of chemical
preservatives is practically the same a.Â«
.that of heatâ they either destroy thevl
tality of the organisms present or'so-par
siyze it as to render the action of o theor
ganisms ineffective." Unfortunately, how.
ever,- for the digestive system, 'these pre
servatives have practicably the same -ef
fect upon the digestive processes that they
have upon the processes which
decay external to. the stqmach. s 'In othei
words; th'e" process ot digestion is really
a process of fermentation, "and the-pres
ence of these preservatives In food arrests
or retards the digestive processes. :Â¦ Som<
"of the most commonly used" preservative!
have . the- most ractive influence in the -re
tardation ? of digestive , activity. Among
these raay be â¢" mentioned salicylic- add
owhich Â¦ on, account of Â¦ its , cheapness ) am
activity Â»may be called the universal >pre
Bervative;;saccharln,' aVpoal-tar product
very* sweet; .which Is often used as a con
diment as . well as a preservative, anc
Â¦formaldehyde, .which' on : account of. It!
easy solubility, in -water .: is the Ideal pre
servative; for liquid^ in. which water is
the - chief -constituent, 'such; as-- milk
Among -other, preservatives which: art
commonly employed are boric, acid,, oi
borax; benzole acid,Â°or -benzoate of soda
sulphurous acid, or. sulpnltes, and- fluor
ides of ammonium and 'sodium. , The abovl
does not by; any means exhaust the list o
preserving agejits,. but shows their typica
character., .-. â¢': . - - . " - â¢ ' <>
There are certain Qondimental preserva
tives which when used In moderation do
not seem to exercise any injurious retard-
Ing effectAipon aigestlon. and among these
may be mentioned the two which are
most generally knownâ sugar and salt.
These bodies exercise a preservative ef
fect chiefly because they tend to extract
water fromÂ°the bodies to which they are
added, and thus reduce the moisture to
a point which prevents the action of the
fermentative process. There can be no
objection urged to the use of such condl
mental substances, and especially or
sugar, which is Itself a food of the high
est value.
Dangers of TocKL Adulteration.
While it is true that the healthy Â«tom
ach may receive small quantities of al
most anyÂ°preserving substance with ap
parent impunity, it is also true that the
weak or deranged digestive organs may
be most seriously affected by even the
smallest quamtity of preserving substance.
The use of preservatives in foods, there
fore, should be so regulated by law as to
prevent the sale of any food product con
taining a preservative which Is not plain
ly labeled in respect of both the charac
ter and amount of the agent employed.
The general dissemination of facts in re
gard to preservatives will thus enable the
Intending purchaser to avoid those arti
cles of food 'which contain preserving
substances which are found injurious to
his particular case. I would even go so
far as to say that certain preserving sub
stances should be prohibited altogether,
inasmuch as theiib sale, evenÂ»when prop
erly labeled, might result in their use by
persons ignorant of, their nature, who
would thus Buffer pTerious Injury In their
health, o
There are other forms= of adulteration
which are less reprehensible, perhaps, oln
regard to their 1 Injury tp health and yet
cannot' be regarded as wholly innocuous.
Among" these may be mentioned tho use
of oleomargarine in the garb of butter
and, glucose In ihe garb of honey. It can
not be said of either of those bodies, when
properly made, that they are not whole
some, and yet they may, prove injurious
when eaten under 'the- supposition that,
they are other substances. At any rate
the fraudulent nature 'of 'such 1 adultera
tion is so flagrant as to merit universal
condemnation. . - ' . " .j_ .-. /
Use of Coloring Matters. 0 \ !i
Less objectionable, from a hygienic
point of view, but none the. less repre
hensible, is the i adulteration of condi
ments with inert substances, for' instance,
the mixture of peppers and spices ' with
fillers produced by grinding some organic
matter to the consistency . of the condi
ment and coloring it to Imitate. the con
dlmental color. â¢ â¢ 'â¢â¢-â¢?Â¦'. . = , Â°
The use of coloring matters In foods
must also be considered as an adultera-,
tlon, and the use of t poisonous coloring
matters should be absolutely prohibited.
Among th<! coloring matters ..which are
usually employed is a large number of
coal tar dyes. In fact, It is hard to find
a sample of pure butter on the market to
day, especially during the winter time.
Almost every sample is colored with a
coal tar dye, and usually to a degree far
in excess of the natural tint of the genu
ine article. The plea which is often'urged
by dairymen that butter is colored in or
der to secure a uniform tint is wholly Il
logical, inasmuch as the samples of but
ter in our market remind one very much
of Joseph's coat on account of their mul
titudinous colors. The natural tint of but
ter made from well-fed cows is sufficient
ly ' attractive for all practical purposes,
and It Is as unfortunate that the habit ot
butter-coloring has gained such a vogue.
Butter color itself, when taken in consid
erable quantities, deranges digestion, and
it is' very probable that there are many
stomachs which would not be able to bear
even the small quantities which ordinary
colored butter contains.. ..^ v _
Well-Nourish.ed Bodies Resist Dis
Â¦â¢ -V;rf Â¦"';â¢ â¢ - : ; " : .v;;e.ase. C: v- .
'From the foregoing It Is seen that the
question: of ' food affects the health and
longevity directly and indirectly. The di
rect-, influences â¢ ..has- Â¦ been sufficiently
pointed out.' Indirectly, malnutrition ren
ders the 'human organism liable to all
forms of disease. As is well known, a
great many uiseases are due to specific
germs or poisons -which enter the system
either through the skin, the lungs or the
Intestinal organs. Cholera, smallpox and
typhoid fever are type* of such diseases.
It is now known that malaria is a disease
which arises from the bite of a mosquito,
and it" is believed that" yellow fever, is
propagated in the same way.
Since It is impossible wholly_to prevent
the entrance of the germs of disease into
the system, it is important to have all the
vital organs in such a state of health and
functional activity as to I enable them to
resist the action of infection. A dozen per
sons, for instance, may be exposed to the
same infection and to the same degree^ Of
these we may suppose one Is suffering
from malnutrition, or has his digestive
organs weakened by impure food or by
food: poorly prepared. He alone of^' the
twelve will fall a victim to ther 3 disease,
while the others have vital organs strong
enough to resist it. : Therefore It Is evi
dent that, other things being equal, the
best method- of protecting a community
against fhe spread of a disease is to
have it well fed by the purest food, pre
pared in the most appropriate way.
Another way in which food affects
health and lcTngevity is the relation which
it bears to the particular functions which
man Is called upon to perform. Nature
has indicated in many ways the proper
food for man in certain conditions. The
inhabitants of the tropics require quite a
different kind of nourishment from the
Eskimo. Where muscular exertion Is the
chief "functional activity, as in hard la
borr experience has shown that a food
which Is largely of a carbohydrate na
ture, such as starch, sugar and their al
lied food, fat to a certain degree. Is most
useful. The people in the Orient, who live
mainly on rice, with a little fish or beans
are. capable of more physical exertion and
have more endurance under hard labor
than people who live largely on lean flesh.
How to Gain a Vigorous Old Age!
- The scientific study of foods wlirdevelop
systems of feeding. man for specific pur
poses so as to secure the greatest amount
of energy In the mos^' economical form,
and thus the health and the life of the
individual will- be protected ',
Ifllfe.be worth living at all Its pro
longation. In vigor and achievement Is the
most , worthy purpose, to which we can
devote our efforts. If old age brings only
burdens and suffering, enfeebled vitality
and loss" of mental : power. It would be an
economic crime to seek to secure and pro
long IC'.But true longevity means the en
tire Â°man,Â° with all hJ3 powers intact, for
the most precious years of -*ls usefulneca.
To seek out the great laws of longevity
ana, to persuade ourselves and our friends
to obey them are the great objects which
we should all Jiave In view. S To accom
plish this end we must expect to see seri
ously proposed .crude and Impossible plans
and Â¦ .wholly Irrelative and Inadequate
means. /The sober student of longevity

He will keep his mind free oX bias and cull
what Js good from all c quarter6. He will
eat and drink, wUh Â¦ moderationâ perhaps
even smoke a -good cigar. He will learn
something 0 useful from the Christian Sci

teetotaler, but he himself will be tem
perÂ«teÂ°ln all things. " in sickness Jie will
tucn to the physician and the pharmacist,
and In sorrow to vthe pastor â¢ fot help.
When throughout the civllize'd world the
study of- longevity shall have secured a
firm foothold, undoubtedly we shall see
laid the foundations of that science of life
which slowly but surely In the perhaps
remote future will- secure to the^world'the
â¢'services of men and women old, .measured

A REMEDY FOR THE; "WRONG.
r-xESPITE the fact that the people of San Fran-
I ) cisco ' voted- down a proposition to license
*â^ poolrooms in this city, a majority 6f the Board
of Supervisors seem incKned to sanction a renewal of
the evil at Ingleside racetrack. The vote of the board
en Monday is ominous of that result. It is true that
a vote in favor of passing a resolution to print does
not necessarily entail a vote in favor of the measure
when it comes up for final passage. It is reasonable
tc presume that some of. the men who voted with the
majority on Monday may refuse in the end to ignore
the will of the people as expressed at the last elec
tion, and consequently who have tr>ade the opOT
and honest, fight for. morality have- no cause- for
abandoning "their , efforts. Until the threatened
wrong has been fully perpetrated the protests against
it should continue to be vigorous and emphatic.
Even should the board pass the ordinance over the
vote of the people, the victory of the gamblers will
not be complete. There remains a potent resource in
the hands of the supporters of morality. They can
by petition take an appeal from the Supervisors'to the
people at the . ensuing election. The charter pro
vides for such an appeal, and if at the coming elec
tion the people once more vote down the scheme of
the gamblers the prohibition will be established in
the ordinances of the city beyond the power of Su
pervisors to repeal.
TO that end, therefore, the attention of the public
must now be directed. If the Supervisors legalizs
pool-selling and bookmaking at Ingleside prepara
tions must at once be made for .taking the appeal.
The whole issue is in the hands of the people. They
can crush the wrong despite all thatjhe gamblers and
their allies on the board can-do. â¢
In this connection it is to be noted that when Ingle
side racetrack was in the hands of men of moderate
means the Mayor was eager to suppress gambling at
the track, and the Supervisors supported him, so that
the present ordinance was enacted. Since then a few
rich men have bought the track at a reduced price.
Permission to resume gambling at the track will
vastly increase its value, and the rich owners desire
that permission. That which was denied to poor men
they think they can obtain for themselves. In fact,
they appear to have made their speculation in Ingle
side track upon the assumption that this is a rich
man's government; and' that they can have all they
csk {or. o Â° â¢â¢ Â°o C . Â° 0 . Â°.>-.Â° 0'
Â¦" It niust'be conceded that upon the face of thefacts
they, do not appear to. have made a mistake so far Â¦ ?^
the pres'eftt "city government is concerned.

The New British Dynasty.
The correspondent "who wrote to The
Mall and Empire two weeks ago that
with the death of the Queen the Guelpn
dynasty has comÂ© to an end 4a supported
by several of the English .papers. In tho
Birmingham Gazette Is the statement thut
a dynasty ends when the head of the

The Russian Government acts quickly.
The receipt by ft of the news that Russian
beet sugar Imported Into this country
must pay an additional duty of nearly
three-quarters of a cent a pound to offset
an alleged bounty has led to swift re
prisals. After March 1 the Russian duties
on American machinery and steel and
Iron goods will be Increased about 50 per
cent. Such an Increase will put an end to
the profitable and expanding business in
these goods which some American manu
facturers have been building up In Russia.
They feared retaliation in the event of
the imposition of a countervailing' duty on
Russian beet sugar, and what they dread
ed has come to pass. An appeal lies from
the ruling of the Treasury Department to
the Supreme Court. Should an appeal be
taken that court may decide, in me course
of human events, that the department la
In error. In the event of such a decision
the Russian Government will no doubt
lower the duties it has Just raised. In the
meantime there will be no shipments df
American Iron and steel goods to Russia.
A controversy over a small cargo of beet
sugar is going to kill, for a time at least.
a promising trade, Chicago manufac
turers of farm machinery will be losers
by the suppression of that trade. If the
Supreme Court should reverse the ruling
Of the Treasury Department Russia will
be satisfied, but Germany. France or Aus
tria-Hungary Â¦will contend that its bÂ«*Â«*t
sugar should not pay higher taxes than
that of Russia, and that It will be Justified
In adopting retaliatory measures. This
beet sugar question may cause much
trouble and close several fore) en marKet3
to a number of American products before
It is finally disposed of. -^-Chicago Tribune.
The Destruction of the. Maine.
Americans in Havana celebrated the
third anniversary of the destruction of
the Maine on Friday, and it Is prtbable
that the day will long attract public no
tice in the chief, city of Cuba. Mean
while a Chicago company is Retting ready
to raise the wreck of the warship which
was the Immediate cause of a great
change in the positron and destinies of the
United States. Before the physical evi
dences of the momentous event In the
harbor of Havana on the night of Feb
ruary 15, 1S93, shall be removed all possi
ble means ought to be employed to settle
forever, not merely for Americans, but for
all the world, including Spain, the nature
of .the explosion which destroyed tho
Maine. When the wreck U taken away,
intact or in fragments, the last chance
will pass for learning anything more re
garding the ! explosion which sunk a fine*
ship and destroyed nearly all of her crew.
It is a mistake to suppose that the find
ings of the American naval court were
decisive as to the cause of the wreck of
the Maine outside of the United States.
The Â¦ great !"â¢ majority of : those European
authorities who shape history for their
countries and color the views of coming
generations doubtless still adhere, as they
did from the first, to -the Spanish view
that the Maine was blown up- from with
in. They do not believe that a Spanish
mine wrecked the vessel or that a Span
ish torpedo struck the ship. That is why
It is well that every possible opportunity
for throwlnK more light on the question
should be Improved. It is not a matter of
immediate practical importance whether
the official and popular view of the disas
ter which was taken in this country was
correct, but it will be a subject ot keen
interest to future generations anxious to
do justice to Spain and more eager to feel
sure of the soundness of the position
maintained by their own country. Let us
get all the additional evidence possible
to obtain regarding the wreck of the
Maine. No point should be missed. . No
bit of proof can properly be neglected.â

In 1900; another fall to 1 $6 39 ; took place.y The' year
1901 will probably show another advance.
Recapitulating, the per'' capita of "Federal expenses

It is not fair to our own times, however, to base
expenditures upon a per capita comparison. The rise
of expenses has gone with extension of our national
area. The objects of governmental care, even limit
ing Government to its police powers alone, have mul
tiplied with. the additions to our territory that have
taken place since 1791. In that year the United States
covered an area of only 827,844 square miles.' â¢
In 1803 we Louisiana, 1,171,931 square
miles: In iSijfwe added Florida, 59,268 square miles.
In 1845 we admitted Texas, with 376,133 square miles.
In 18^8 we acquired from Mexico 545,783, and again
in 1853 45,535 square miles,'andfrom Russia in -1867.
577,390 square miles, so that -now we have j$i area
of 3,603,884 square miles, exclusive of Hawaii, Porto
Rico and the Philippines. â¢ - : '
Our area having increased more than fourfold since
iSoi, and its settlement by bur; people requiring gov
ernment over it all, we may felicitate ourselves that in
1900 we were paying less than four times as much' per
capita as government cost a hundred years before,
when there was so much less to govern. ;. \ -

For tliÂ« Chlre.^of Catarrh.
A physician now mired frpm praeUce.
but who fctlll keeps ahreaat of th*Â» tlmea
in speaking cf the bdvajire ma<ie In med-
icine In the last ten- years 'nays: â¢"One of
the most obstinate . raid baffling' diseapes
is the very -common trouble, catarrh â¢â¢
"NasaJ catarrh Is only- onÂ« of Its many
forms; catarrh cf the throat, catarrh of
tho Btomach, bowels, liver and bladder
are very common, but thÂ» sufferer usually
thinks It Is something .else than catarrh
and la treated. for the wrong 1 disease. ' * '
"The best and most successful treatment
for any form of catarrh is now 'admltteil
to bo by Internal remedies through the
stomach, and the safest and probably the ,
most efficient is In the tablet form, sold
ty druggists aa Stuart's' Catarrh Tablets.
"I have seen many remarkable cures of
catarrh resulting from -regular dally use
of the>Â«e tablets, which seem to act on
the Wood and liver, driving the catarrhat
poison out of the .system through tho nat-
ure 1 channels.
"I once had occasion %o analyze these
tablets and found. them to contain no co-
caine nor opiates, but simply a combina-
tion of harmless antisepf*:s like Eucalyp-
tal; Guaiacol. blood root, etc. . .
."'At any rate. I have known of severe ca-
tarrhal headaches which were -cured by
Smart's Catarrh Tablets, and catarrhal
'.rtfafness, hay fever." asthma and catarrh
of the throat and Btcmadh speedily show
great benefit after a' few days' use of
the remedy, and when it Is remembered
how much more convenient 'a tablet Is
than inhalers, douches, salves and pow-
ders it is not surprising that this new
preparation should so rapidly, supplant all
other remedies for catarrh/*

LATES UPON ITS NEAR FUTURE.
CHICAGO, Feb. 27.â February Is down on the
wheat speculator's calendar as a bear month,
and possibly a desire to support this allega
tion moved the bear contingent to accept easy
cables and rofee-c_'.ored Kansas crop tidings
es sufficiently Important factors to justify let
ting out short lines. May opened at '76%@76%c,
a ehade under yesterday. Wheat came out on
a constantly increasing scale until May reached
73%@7J%c', where the market steadied and re
acted to 76c. on reports of a strong cash mar
ket at Minneapolis and- the engagement of four
loads of wheat for Lisbon. This advance failed
of support and the market dropped- back to
75V4c. Heavy seaboard clearances, and liberal
export pales caused moderate covering under
which the market reacted to 76Vtc and closed
steady at that figure. . %c under yesterday.
Corn opened easier under the Influence of the
better grading of the cereal received to-day.
The bears . asserted themselves and caused a
decline, Â¦ ft::! the close was steady under cov
ering from the wheat strength. May left off
>Â£c lowur at 40-*)ic. Â¦
' Oats were fairly active and followed corn
May closed- WÂ®Uc- lower at 25',4c.

to the speculative world, as it was hoped that
when the doubts and uncertainties attending
the period of negotiations were cleared up and
the great consolidation of control fully as
fured prices of the securities would reflect the
heped-for advantages to the owners cf the
properties. There was large trading again In i
the stocks -of the group to-day, but It was In i
larpre lÂ«irt. on arbitrage operations from one j
stock to another. The discrepancy in the |
prices of the stocks and their privileges of con
version into the stock of the United States J
Steel Corporation forms the basts of these i
operations. Th^y conrlat In the purchase of i
such m?mbeis of the ijroup as are proportion- j

these purchases of stock* which are high. The '
natural tendency of these operations Is to !
bring the price* of the various stocks to a '
basis consistent with their relative claims for
thÂ» new stock. For the purpose of accom
modating these arbitrage operators there were
also dealings en the curb In contracts to 'de
liver when issued th* new United States Steel-

REBELLION AGAINST
THE SULTAN OP WADI
The Retail Merchants* Association
made two moves yesterday, both intended
to enable the members of the association
tn keep their stores nj>en evenings with
out interference or annoyance by tho
members of the Retail Clerks' Union. A
Milt was filed by John T. Gibson of 3204
Market etreÂ«"t apainst J. A. Johnston,
John Doe FieM. I>eo Kaufman, B. II. i
Bryan. E. A. Poe, Lewia Walienstein, T. j
I. Dillon. Louis Livingston and othsrs, to
secure an order restraining the clerks
from interfering in any way with the
plaintiff's business. Judge Dunne made
Â«n order givxne the defendants until Fri
day, March 8. to answer, and assigning
the case to Department L P. F. DunnÂ©
appears for the. plaintiff.
An appeal to the public was also issued
in which it was t^et forth that, after early
closing for forty-live days, the email re
tail dealers found that the movement was
detrimental to their business and that the
inevitable result of it if persisted in would
l>e to drive a large number of small
houses into failure and to deprive busi
ness men of email capital and resources
of the richt to earn a legitimate and hon
est livelihood. The intention of the asso
ciation is declared as follows:
â¢Efforts at adjustment have been made
without avail, and the dealers are now
resolved, if the law of the land, as plain
ly written, can be enforced, to keep open
their ptorcs until S o'clock every evening,
with the exception of Saturday evenings,
and the evenings before holidays, and
the evenir.g-s during the month of Decem
ber."
It Is also set forth that many persons
are unable to leave their work before 6
p. m. who cannot trade in articles of util
ity until after that hour. The movement,
the association through its executive com
mittee also Rajra, will drive the trade into
the hands of the large and consolidated
â¢â¢staMisbments. The appeal is made "to
ihe p^neral American public Â¦which loves
fair play and believes In liberty regulated
I'v law," for patronage and protection.
The Retail Clerks' Association has en
prafjecl counsel to defend members in case
any attempt is made to restrain them
from protecting their interests or giving
publicity to the early closl.ig movement
by having parades and wearing badges.
SUIT TO RESTRAIN
CLERKS' UNION FILED
Steamship Company Gains Victory
Over Collector and Exclusion â¢
Act as Interpreted.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
has achieved a temuoiary victory over
Port Collector Stratton and the Chinese
exclusion act as heretofore interpreted
and executed at this port. The Treasury
Department has ruled that after a Chi
nese immigrant Is denied a landing: he
reed not be taken back to China, but may
be larded in Mexico or Canada.
Under date of December 17. 1500, the f 3l -
lowing letter was sent from the Treasury
Department to Customs Collector Strat
ton:
The bureau acknowledges the receipt of your
lptt^r of the 12th instant In regard to your re
fusal of the application of Mr. F. V. Bell, at
torney for Yee Hock, to permit his client's des-.
tination to be changed from San Francisco to
Guaymas. Mexico.
Perhaps some misapprehension has arisen
over the Inadvertent inclusion, on pafre 46 of
the laws and treaty regulations relating to the
exclusion of Chinese, of the phrase "must be
returned to the country whence they came," as
Euch requirement under the law refers only to
those who have been found Illegally In the
ITnlted Ptates. Maurice O'Connell. solicitor of
the treasury, F^ys, under date of September 21:
"I think that the language applies only to these
cates in which Chinese persons make in the first
instance preparations for Journeying to some
other country than the United States, and ap
proach the shores of the United States with the
I eole purpose and Intention of parsing through in
I the course of theirÂ«Jonrney to euch other coun
try. It would be obviously a Â»?reat hardship to
! deny to bona fide travelers the privilege of tran
elt through the United States under such cir
cumstances. But the caFe of the Chinese la
borer who departs from China upon a Journey
I to the United State* only, and not to some other
I country. Involves no such element of hardship.
He has made no preparation for a Journey
i through the United States, and cannot complain
that he is taken by surprise when the Govern
ment refuses to allow him to be placed across
the Mexican or Canadian frontier, where he
j can exercise his ingenuity In evading the ln-
I Fpectars and securing an overland entry Into
I this country. In the case before us Chinese la
! borers are seeking' the privilege of transit
j through our country In a journey from a port
of the United States to the Mexican border,
which cannot be held to be a Journey to or from
| other countries. I have therefore to advise vou
that. In my opinion, a regulation directing that
permits be refused under the circumstances
above described may be lawfully made.
The foregoing letter was displeasing to
the representatives of thft Pacific Mall
Steamship Company and that corporation
had Mr. Chambers, Its DOlitlcal represen
tative at Washington, visit Immigration
Commissioner Powderlv and ask him to
give his reasons for dei;ytng*the privilege.
The result was the receipt of a letter
yesterday by Collector Stratton which de
clares: "You have no power to prevent.
Fteamship companies from taking Chinese
passengers who have been rejected by
you to any foreign port after such rejec
tion. It is believed, however, that this
condition tends to defeat th*Â» purpose of
the Chinese exclusion iaw and at the re
quest of the bureau, therefore, the Secre
tary has recommended the passage of a
resolution by Congress which follows
closely the provisions oÂ£ the immigrant
laws requiring the return of rejected Chi
nese to China or other country of whlcn
they are citizens or subjects."
Until the necessary ii eislation by Con
press Is enacted rejectta Chinese Immi
grants will be dumped upon Mexican or
Canadian territory to make their way Into
the ITnlted States over the border at their
pleasure.

Mrs. Waiter, pinmorey the bride of two
short weeks; is journeying to [Denver as
fast as an overland express can carry her,
and her husband is -straightening out his
business affairs; which- were somewhat
disturbed by: his attention to matters mat
rimonial/ '..- -' ' .'â¢ Â¦'. "Â¦Â¦'Â¦ â¢"''â¢ â¢
For several days Mrsl . â¢ Dlnmore, al
though coritined to.'thfi McNutt hospital,
had been making preparations for her
flight from this city;! -The tickets were
bought and the baggage was ordered
taken from the Palace. Hotel and placed
on tbÂ« train that left the city at 10 a, m.
Tuesday. But there was a. hitch in the
programme. The Palace Hotel manage- I
ment .said ihat Mrs. Dlnmore could have
her baBgase, but first the wedding break- j
fast l<iil of J1S7 60 must be paid. It is eaid
that Mrs. l>inmore paid the bill for the
feant and that the baggage was duly
checked to Denver. Dinmore says that
Charles C Mclvor called for his wife at
the McXutt hospital in a closed carriage |
half an hour before the train left, and
that Mclvor was also fortunate enough to
be the last in this city to wish Mrs. Vln
cent-Cone-Dlnmore uieÂ« Morgan) a bon
voj>ige. Joseph Van Praag, who 1b a
friend of Mclvor, and was on the train, is
supposed to be going to Denver with Mrs.
Dinmore to assist her in the closing up
of her business.
Charles Mclvor was around town yes
terday, and when asked about the affair
smiled and diplomatically kept his peace.
Last evening he was very busy dispatch
ing telegrams, and it is conjectured that
he is in communication with his. friend,
Van Praag.
"I don't know whether my wife Is in this
citv or is on her way to Denver," said
Dinmore last night. "I had a friend go
Tuesday evening to the McNutt hospital
to see my wife. He was told that my wife
was in the hospital, but that she had no
word she wished to send to me. Others
tell me that she left early Tuesday morn
ing in a hack with Mclvor to catch the
10 o"clock train for Denver. Well, there
you are. I don't know which to believe.
She may be in the city or she may be on
her way to Denver. I know one thing,
and that Is that I know of no reason why
*he should have acted the way she did.
I am going to let the whole affair pass out
of my mind and settle down to business
again.
"Mr. Mclvor also acted very peculiarly.
When the estrangement arose between me
and my wife he appeared to take a great
interest in the affair. I asked him to find
] out the reason for my wife's strange ac
! tlons. and he replied that he was as
! much at sea as I was. I have not met Mr.
I Mclvor yet. and think it very funny that
he has discontinued calling on me."
It appears that during Mrs. Dinmore's
short sojourn at the McNutt hospital she
made herself the confidant of the nurses.
She told them that she was through with
1 Dinmore and that she was going back to
[ Denver. It Is generally conceded that
! Mrs. Dinmore will institute divorce pro
! ceedings on her arrival In Denver, and
friends of both parties will learn with
much interest the grounds on which she
will make her plea for separation. j

"I wish to say," said the speaker, "that
the statement that the founder of our
university ever demanded the removal of
any ono Is absolutely false. Her opinion
that Professor Ross was not a fit person
to hold the position of an instructor was
shared by fully four-tifths of the faculty.
"Stanford University believes In leaving
and leaves its professors complete freedom
in matters of opinion, instruction and ac
tion. But believing as we do that all
freedom has Its proper limitations we
think that every one must exercise such
telf-restralnt as will prevent his infring
ing upon the rights of others. In thl.*
direction we propqse to protect the name
of the university and the rights of the
students entrusted to us, and we Intend
to see to It that the university will noc,
through the zeal of some of its professors,
be made the noisy tailpiece of any po
litical party.
"We think this but fair In the long run
to every one concerned, but. In any case,
it is the one course that ordinary sell
respect leaves open to us. And yet, In
our endeavor to carry out such a policy,
wt> of the Stanford University, after
seven or eight years of- fretted patience,
have lately been belabored the, length and
breadth of the land. Investigated by self
appointed committees, arraigned by pul
pit orators, as cringing sycophants;
sympathetic college professors 3000 miles
away have hastened to point at us aa
something vile, to be shunned by most
people and suspected by all; and be
cause we have not seen fit to open up the
matter in detail to the public gaze all the
stinkpots known to the arts of the dema
gogue have been turned loose upon us."
Continuing, the speaker said that those
responsible for the future of Stanford
University recognized the duty which lay
plain and straight ahead of them, and
that they proposed to follow It in spite
of bugaboos.

General Manager "White arrived from

pcended the slopes, and will remain on the
pround until operations are resumed. He
pives* it as his opinion that there will still
tÂ»e sorne fire to fight on the sixth level

immediately after the recovery of these
bodies the workers encountered much dif
ficulty on account of gas, which for a
time stopped progress. All day efforts
have been made to shut off the gas.
I^iite this afternoon six more bodies
Â¦were found, and they were brought up to
night.
At 4 o'clock this mornlnc word came to
the wurtmem that four bodies had been en
countcrcd the seventh level, and a few
minutes la"<T they were brought up. The
r.;en h.Â«d all f:illen face downward and
ell wi:h their heads in the wrong direc
tion, as one of the relief party expressed
It. Ins-tead of retreating from the advanc
x;:g smoke they had tried to ru&h through
the deadly gas. with the most deplorable
result. Of the eight hodies recovered
ir.ere was but one that showed any ap
jearar.ee of having suffered in the final
tgony. The exception was a man Â«hu
fctid literally buried himself in the earth
of the level in his ina-i effort to obtain re
liet from the deadly gas. After being re
moved to the surface the bodies were
stripped and washed and laid on the
piatform of the morgue for the purpose of
identification, being covered with sheets.
Xhere was no difficulty in identification.
&s the skin was not discolored nor were
the features distorted in any manner. It
Is believed that seven of the men died by
the deadly gas without knowing it. The
names of the men were: ICdou.ix<l Roni. I*.
rtoni. I^trenio Franzoi. Joe Kranzol, Ba
tista Bassolta, Florienl Arnr.zier.l. J. T.
Simpson and Everett Blmpson. The last
two were father and sun, the boy but
17 years old. The wife and mother of
these was yesterday reported as having
died from srief. Following the disaster
the had been subject to violent fits of
hysteria in which a state of coma would
ensue. One of these lasted po long that
her death was actually- believed to have
occurred. More than once to-day she
viewed the remains <jf her husband and
pon. only to be led away each time,
thrlekir.g with acute mental agony. At 1
o'clock to-day a bapgape car was moved
alongside the morgue. It had come from
Palt Lake, and contained a cargo of cof
fins. Into these the bodies were placed.

Dear Siri
I have been an advertiser in the dif-
ferent papers several years, but in my
experience The Call has given by far the
best returns of any city paper. Recently
I wished to sell a thousand gallons of
wine and selected The Call as the paper.
The whole quantity was disposed of as the
result of a three-time advertisement, and
this quick sale waB made entirely from
advertising in : your paper.; I shall con-
tinue, tp give you the bulk of my adver-
tising.:/ /;;, Very truly yours, t ,. ,.

represents issue of stock and abandoned
property, leaving $18,470,300 08 as a basis
for -fixing rates. By a third method of

Reid PFaces Valuation of
Spring Valley at Twenty '
Minions.
Supervisor Reed yesterday submitted* to*
the Board of Supervisors a proposed ordi
nance fixing water rates, for Its consider
ation at the, meeting this afternoon. The
ordinance fixes the rates upon a valuation
of J20.000.0C0 on the Spring Valley plant
and allowa $196,000 for taxes and J425.000
for operating expenses. Reed recommends
a cut of 5 per cent in householders' rates
and a 35 per cent cut in shipping rates;
that the board fix a uniform meter rate
of 17 cents per 100 cubic feet, and that the
charge for hydrant service and other pub
lic charges be. done away with, as they
are not based upon the amount of water
used.
Reed also filed a statement of what he
regards as the law and the facts in rela
tion to the fixing of water rates. After
quoting from the constitution 1 and court
decisions to show that the Spring Valley
"Water Company Is In the possession of
property which has been devoted by the
constitution to the use of the people, Reed
draws the following conclusions:
The whole obligation of the people toward
the water company Is to fix reasonable rates
and allow Just compensation.
The courts will step In and nullify the rates
fixed by the legislative body only when the
act of the Supervisors . if enforced would re
sult in the taking of the property without Just
compensation.
The depreciation in the property of the
water- company Is not to be provided against
in the rates fixed by the board.
The orielnal cost is. the basic element Jn
arriving at the actual Value of the plant. .
Only the property of the water company at
the time It Is being used for the public should
enter into the computation upon which actual

Referring to yours of ISth, matter rests with

On the ISth inst. United States District

I am In receipt of your letter of Â¦ February

Calumet. Mich., whereon is attached copy of
press dispatch from San Francisco with refer
ence to the selllnc at auction of five Chinese
Klrls in Chinatown, San Francisco, in the
month of January.
I .understand the facts to 'be as follows:
During the month of January two buildings
Were sold in San Francisco at auction. That
they were at the time houres of ill-fame, and
I that the Chinese girls referred to were inmates
of the houses. â¢ -
I understand that these Klrls were included
as chattels, passim; with the house. Accord
inn to Oriental custom, mysterious, inscrutable,,
without the pale of the law, these things are
done. .
The authorities do their best, yet, inseparable
from their institutions, these degrading Influ
ences are brought here with the Chinese.
There Is no doubt of the trade and traffic In
immoral slavery. They are not sold. In the
market place under the sanction which en
couraged the trade as of old. .yet behind lies,
deceitB and degrading practices, Chinese slav

SCHOOL BOARD
MAKES CHARGE
OF DUPLICITY
Constable Theodore Molles of Crockett
was In the- city yesterday. He says that
Cooper got two diamond rings from Jo
seph Broder.of Crockett. 1 It Is on Bro
der's complaint that the warrant has been
issued for Cooper's \ arrest for procuring
money by false pretenses. - Mrs. Groom
of the Star Hotel at Crockett was directed
by Cooper to prepare a wedding supper
for twenty guests at $5 per plate for last
Monday night. She ordered champagne to
the amount of $150., Constable MoUes
warned her not to get the dinner until
she saw the money for it and she was
wise enough to take his advice.' Molles
says .that Cooper and Nora Schneider left
Port Costa at 9:15 Sunday morning on the
train for Sacramento. " The seal on Coo
per's bogus papers was made at 228 Mont
gomery-street. . 7
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 27.â While at San
Quentln Oooper was 'regarded as one of
the most dangerous men In the Institu
tion* The latter portion of his imprison-,
ment was spent In an Incorrigible cell. In
.the spring of 189S "Cooper, together with
eight or nine other prisoners, concocted a
scheme to escape. : Cooper at that time
was employed in the kitchen of the night
guard. According â¢ to the plans of the
pchemers. Cooper was to poison the coffee
of the guards, and then he and his associ
ates were to effect their escape. Captain
Edgar discovered the plot in time, and the
men were placed In the dungeon. Cooper
was the first one to break down..- He told
the whole story, throwing the blame on
the : others. It afterward developed that
he was the ringleader. From-that time on
he occupied an incorrigible cell. -
Cooper's record is long, although he Is
still young. Young women who fell vic
tims to him vere Bertha E. Young of
Brisbane, Helen Scott of Sydndy. N. S.
Â¦\V., and Ida M. Campaignc of Shel
bourne..'Ontario. He has done -time at
hard labor in the Antipodes, and has been
before courts In various places repeatedly
on criminal charges. .- Â¦
Mrs. Schneider, on learning that Cooper
has a wife living, was somewhat com
forted, for that would render the cere
mony that hurriedly took place at Crock
ett last Saturday night null and void. At
the same time it furnishes ground for a
bigamy charge upon which Cooper can be
prosecuted. Â¦
Every Police Department east of this
city has been supplied by Captain Sey
mour with Â¦Â¦ descriptions- of Cooper and
Nora Schneider. Mrs. Schneider is cer
tain that Cooper had little money, the
total not to exceed $55, last Saturday, but
he may have raised money on the $2"iO dia
mond engagement ring that was bought
with a check in this city. As Captain E.
M. Colville of Crockett indorsed that check
he is a loser to that amount. As late as
yesterday a chock of the same size,
drawn by Cooper, was presented at the
Donohoe-Kelly Bank for payment. Pre
viously the checks presented amounted to
$5000. Dr. Rlley of Port Costa Is reported
to have accepted a check for $2000.
A singular feature of the transaction
connected with and leading up to the
Crockett wedding is that Cooper did not
receive any of the' goods for which he
passed out checks, with the exception of
the diamond ring procured from A. An
drews, and the diamond â¢ dealer took
pains to delay the delivery of- the ring
until he found out that the check was
good. It is reported that one Crockett
man took Cooper's note for $400 In money.
All of this goes to show that Cooper may
have the means Â¦ to get- some distance
away. â¢ Â¦'. â¢
Mrs. Schneider, mother of Nora, vlsite-1
police headquarters yesterday and added
some statements to those she had previ
ously made concerning the actions of
Cooper, alias Chadwick. She said that
Cooper, after he. presented the evidence,
manufactured for the occasion, . of â¢ the
large inheritance he was to receive from
the estate of an alleged aunt in England,
actually went through. the motions or hav
ing a corporation formed in this city lor
the purpose of managing the estate. She
was much surprised when Captain.Sey
mour told her that Cooper had prevlously
served four girls as ne had her daughter
one In England, two in Australia and one
in Canada. He was also on the point oi
eloping with another from the Hotel
Langham in this city the night Seymour
arrested him on the charge that resulted
in sending him to 3an Quentln, from
which he emerged only about a month
ago.' ... . .
The seal on the bogus notification of the
English estate of Eliza Adelaide Chad
wlck was exactly like one that Cooper
used in. a similar exoloit several years
ago, which is In Captain Seymour's poa-.
session. On the former occasion Cooper
claimed to be heir to the estate of Sir
Harry W. Cooper and he borrowed $2000
at that time from Mrs. McDonald, his
wife's mother, to go to England to receive
that estate. Â¦
Mrs. Schneider claimed to have discov
ered that the seal on the document used
to deceive her daughter into dreams o.
wealth and luxury was manufactured on
Montgomery street in this citv.
Everything that. Cooper exhibited in
Crockett as evidence of his standing was
fraudulent, Including his diploma as n
physician. The name of Chadwlck was
not new to him. In 18%. In Sydney. N. S.
"W.. he was held on two charges of pro
curing money by false pretenses under tlie
name of Charles Ernest 1 Chadwlck. He
has merelv readopted t>n old name.
"When he came out of San Quentln."
said Captain Seymour, yesterday, "he told
me that he was golnc to Crockett to do
something. I told him then that he would
do somebody. He called on me first on
the day he left San Quentln. Later on he
called on me twice. He said that he had
a job at Crockett and was connected with
Dr. Rlley. There is no doubt that Cooper
and' Chadwlck are one and the same
man."
Nora Schneider of Crockett was seen
Sunday afternoon by Theoaore Kytka, the
handwriting expert, on a train going to
Sacramento. She was accompanied by
Harry Westwood Cooper, alias Ernost
Moore Chadwlck. Kvtka ki.ew j Cooper
very ..well, by: sight. Yesterday, he- notified
the police of this city and a reauest wa3
Immediately sent out fay Captain Seymour
to all the police at all "Eastern points to
arrest Cooper on sight. A warrant for
Cooper's arrest on a charge of obtaining;
money by false pretenses had been sworn
out at Port Costa. KvtHa did not know
that there was any reason for saying any
thing about Cooper until the exolo'ts at
Crockett of Cooper, alias Chadwlck, were
published lp this paper yesterday.

the power to repair school buildings, to
appoint Janitors, to establish new schools,
the ultimate power of approving or reject
ing school buildings, and numerous other
functions." said Denman. â¢
"The bill certainly does not give the
Superintendent such pow ers . but the
State law docs." replied Webster. It
does that the Superintendent
shall organize new classes when they are
deemed a necessity and the board refuses
to do so."
Kingsbury Denies Accusation. '
"If any of my subordinates would make
such an offer." said Webster, "I .would
dismiss him forthwith. Why, I recall that
the same charge was made before the
Senate Judiciary Committee by Director
Denman's son. and Kingsbury then and
there branded the statement as absolute
ly false. Klngsbury returned from Sacra
mento late yesterday afternoon and em
phatically asserted that he had never
made any kind of a proposition to Di
rector Mark regarding the school bills.
He Kavs that he had a conference with
Mark at the latter's request and. the sub
ject of future contingencies that would
arise should the bills bo passed and the.
advisability : of withdrawing them was
discussed Informally. Kingsbury says
that neither he nor Mark committed hlm
pelf, and he expressed much surprise at
the board's accusation."
The board also adopted another reso
lution protesting against the passage of
thÂ« bill now before the Legislature and
designed to fix the salaries of Deputy
Superintendents at $3000 per year.
The board assigned Miss J. McDonald.
No. 1 on the substitute list, to the Sher
man Primary School as a regular teacher.
Mis* M. Liner, No. 1 on the unasslgned
list, was transferred to' the substitute list.
Leaves of absence were granted to
Miss J. E. Clark and Miss Ksther Lev
lngston.
In his regular monthly report' to the
board. Superintendent Webster again
calls attention, to the crowded condition
of the Bernal School and recommends
that an additional teacher - be assigned
thereto. Deputy Howard also, reports
that the Hearst School has a. crowded
class in that of Miss. Van den Bertr. where
there are -fifty-nine â¢ pupils enrolled and
only fifty-eight seats with desks.
George Crocker, president of the Pacific
Improvement Company, arrived in the
city last evening from New York In his
special car. He was accompanied by his
wife and her two daughters, the Misses
Rutherford. . â¢ â¢ ,
What the outcome of Mr. Crocker s
visit to the coast will be 1Â» at present
somewhat doubtful. He said this was
the annual visit he paid California to run
over the. affairs of the Pacific Improve
ment Company. He was asked if it was
true that the company he is the presi
dent of was about to sell to the Southern
Pacific all its realty holdings in San
Francisco. He said he did not yet know
whether that deal would be consummated,
but that if a good figure was offered for
the properties they would be sold.
Mr Crocker denied the report that the
Harriman syndicate had offered to buy
the Crocker stock in the Pacific Improve
ment Company, and emphatically, re
marked that this stock was not on the
market. He claimed that, though the
Harriman syndicate is in control of a
large amount of the Southern Pacific
Railroad stocks, yet it is not In control
of the board. ... , ,
"The Harriman syndicate has. said
Crocker, "only two-fifths of the stock.
To gain possession of the board at tne
next annual meeting it will have to use
similar tactics to those employed by thp
late C P. Huntingdon and secure proxies
representing many shares. These are
easily obtained, however, and the syndi
cate'will secure control of the pad.

Company May Dispose

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS,

What suffering 1 frequently resnlts
from a mother's ignorance ; cr more
f reqtiently from a mothers neglect to
properly instruct her daughter 1
Tradition says "Tvoman must suf-
fer," and yo-juj women are bo taught.
There is -a little t rut u and a great deal
cf ei^g-g-eration in this. If a young
woman suffers severely she needs
treatment, and her mother should see
that she gets it.
Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a phj-sician for examina-
tion; but no mother need hesitate to
Â¦write freely about her daughter or
herself to Mrs. Pinkham and secure
the most efficient advice without
charge. Mrs. Pihkham's address is
Lynn, Mats. Â» â¢? j~ *
Mrs. August Pfalsgraf, of South
Byron, Wis., mother of the young lady
Whose portrait ttc here publish, â¢wrote
Mrs. Pinkhcm in January, 1699, saying
her daughter had suffered for two
vears with irregular menstruation â
had headache all the time, and pain in
her side, feet 6well. and was generally
miserable. Mrs. Pinkham promptly
replied with advice, and under date of
March. 189i>, the mother writes a^ain
