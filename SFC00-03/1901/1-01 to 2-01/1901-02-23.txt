DEATH ACHIEVES A DREAD
TRIUMPH AT THE GOLDEN GATE

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY,. FEBRUARY 23; 1901V
THE Pacific Mail
steamship City of Rio
de Janeiro went down
vesterda\ r morninsr at
the Golden Gate and
one hundred and
twenty-two human lives and a
king's ransom in treasure were
deatlrs harvest of horror for the
day. Within the harbor which
should have meanP security after
a voyage of storm and distress,
human beings struggled, and
fought for their lives, not against
the elements, for the sea was an
calm as a -sea ( of â¢ glass and ; the
winds were stilled, but against the
death damage that the rocks" had
done. Â¦
Wrapped in a shroud of /fog,
within hearing and it seemed al
most within a stone's throw of the
city, these human creatures met
death in its most .awe inspiring,
dread form/The accident in every
phase was without parallel in ma
rine disasters on this coast. Other
ships had sunk' at sea .in the midst
of frightful storms. ' .Others : had
foundered because "of their dWi
incapacity, to struggle against the
elements, but* the f City of Rio de

Last Night at Sea.
â¢ The night was clear and pleas

mander of the vessel; accepted a
pilot, Captain Frederick Jordan,
who Hs' reputed "to be one of the
most [expert and careful pilots on
the 'coast/ And ; now between that
reputation" and' the conduct of the
dead captain of the City of Rio de
Janeiro must rest the responsi
bility for the doom of one hun
dred and twenty-two human Jives
and the loss of more than $1,800,
ooo in property. This responsi
bility belongs to one of them or
to the other, or perhaps to both.
Captain Jordan boarded the ship
and Â¦ at 7 o'clock, the fog having
settled down like a great black
pall, it was decided to anchor out
side for the night.

Officials of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company declare that
the responsibility must rest whol
ly upon the unfortunate captain
who went down with his ship. It
is claimed that a pilot is employed
solely for the purpose of acting
in an advisory capacity and that
he does not take command of the
ship. He is to act solely in sug-'
gestion and to warn the com
mander of the incoming vessel if
anything unusual has happened in
the harbor since he left. If this
be the habit of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company it is. in viola
tion of a universal custcm at this
port.
Crashed on the Rocks.
With pilot and captain on the
bridge the City of Rio de Ja
neiro passed through the Heads.
She was in the harbor of San
Francisco. Her long journey
was ended. Within an hour she
should have been in sight of the
town, past all danger. The fog
which enveloped her and which
shut out the western heights o!
the city and which made it impos
sible for the men upon the bridge
to see the crew at wdrk below,
was thicker than ever, it seemed,
but 'the commander hoped that it
would soon rise. Then came the
Then slowly again the great
shroud of fog fell upon the sea
and the bay. Denser it seemed
than before, but the two captains
on the bridge decided to go
ahead. Upon whom shall rest the
awful responsibility for the great
loss of a ship and its cargo and the
greater -Joss of one hundred and
twenty-two* lives, a court of in
quiry must determine. There is
in the service of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company a standing
order to even* captain employed
by that corporation not to leave a
harbor nor to enter one in the
fog. Captain Ward disobeyed
that order. There is also a uni
versal principle that when a pilot
steps on board a vessel he is. ab
solutely master of the ship and
can be swayed in no possible way
by any order or suggestion of the
master of the ship. Captain
Frederick Jordan violated .'that
principle.^
Responsibility.
?cncers and crew settled them
selves in patience. Warning
liprits were fixed upon the vessel
and now and again her siren
sounded its hoarse signals. At 4
o'clock yesterday morning the
fog cleared, and again the Cliff
House, a beacon and a welcome
after the long^ journey, could be
seen. There was movement upon
the ship even at that hour. Many
of the pa?senjrcrs were astir, for
they were impatient and eager for
another <^limp?e of land and the
prospect of home. For thou
sands of miles in the ocean they
had been haunted by death and
within two hours in the blackness
and in the silence of the sea they
were to meet him 1 guarding tn e
Golden G2te. As the fog lifted
Captain Ward and Pilot Jordan
went upon the bridge and the or
ders of preparation to move into
the bay were given. The anchor
was weighed and the ship moved
slowly ahead, everybody on
board feeling the thrill of antici
pation.
Confusion reigned absolutely
supreme, for it seemed that all
would be lost. Captain Ward
The ship had struck on the
rocks. Not an officer on board
could mistake that..so,und. \ Cap
tain Ward issued his orders to de
termine what the. damage Was. It
was reported to him that ten feet
of water was already in the for
ward hold and twenty feet! amid
ships. What followed on the
doomed ship can only be told by
the survivors and it is a story of
utmost horror. Jutting out froni
Fort Point is a shoal which' ex
tends in a northeasterly direction. |
Upon the very outer rocks of this
projection the City of. Rio de Ja
neiro had crashed and a great,
gaping hole had been ripped in
her hull. It seerued that almost \
instantly the vessel began to set- \
tie. Captain Ward hastened
from his post and personally su
perintended the work of alarming,
the passengers and hastening
them to the decks: Men, women |
and children rushed" screaming,
shouting, crying up to the decks
and could see nothing around the
sinking ship but the black, dense -
fog. The Chinese crew and pas
sengers went mad with fear. They
fought and scrambled to get out
upon the decks.

The Rio de Janeiro was built by John
Roach & Son of Chester. Pa., in 1S78. She
was 3543 -tons gross and 2275 tons net bur
den. She was 343 feet long. 38 feet 6 inches
beam and 23 Â¦ feet ; 9 inches deep. For
the first few years of li?r life the Rio was
a success, but commencing with the year
1850 there seemed to be a "hoodoo" on her.
On August 5, 1SU0. she "was in collision witn
the British steamer Bombay and was se

repairs before she could return to San
Francisco. . :

out with- the tide near the lightship. A
lifeboat that had all the appearance of
never .having been 'aunched was seen -iff
the Southampton shoal and near to it was
half of one of. the ship's deck houses. The
chances are that by this time there is not
much of the Rio de Janeiro left.
"The first boat over the side was Xo. 11.
Jn charge of Third Mate C. J. Holland.
She wits crowded with passengers ar.d
fcod a number cf women and children
aboard. Just as they were preparing to
push away from th*Â» *Ifie the mizzerf mast
fell and smashed the boat in two. Some
of the rasscngers managed to swim lu
" 'Have you sounded the other bilges?"
asked Captain Ward, and I answered, 'No.
sir." With ten feet' of water in the fore
hold I didn't think It worth while monkey
ing with the other bilges. Captain Ward
thought differently, however, and his
order was a curt 'Go and sound them.' I
mounded amidshlp ar.a found twenty feet
of water in the hold and wont back to
report. I met Captain Ward coming down
from the bridge and when I told him what
was the state of affairs he said. 'Go |o
your boat. I will warn the passengers."
The laÂ«t I Raw of Captain Ward was
when he was going down the social haU
steps to cabins on the main deck. J
think he went down with the ishlp.
"We lay at anchor all night." said he.
"and I turned in early because I knew I
would have to get up when the vessel
was ready to get under way. It is part
of my duty to help Â»ret the anchor In. It
was 4 a. m. yesterday when I was called
8nd told to get out on the forecastle head
as the anchor was going to be hove up.
When the anchor vas pot up we were
under way and we had not got the thing
catted before she struck. There was one
heavy bump and then another. I re
marked to my mats 'We're on the rocks.'
With that I ran and sounded the forward
bilge. That also is part of. my work. I
found there was ten feet of water In the
hold and I at once ran to the bridge and

to record within its limits so horrifying
an item of death as that which must be
made in reference to the doom of the City",
of Rio de Janeiro. When the vessel went
down at the Golden Gate yesterday morn
ing she carried 122 human beings to death.
There were 201 persons on board and only
seventy-nine of -them were saved. It
speaks.well for the heroism of the ship's
oincersthat out of thirty on board nine
teen perished at their posts. Of the.twen
ty-nine cabin "passengers nineteen were
lost, and of the seven second class pas

PRESENTIMENT OF
v , LOSS OF THE RIO
Victims of the .Wreck.
Much interest. Is expressed- In this bay
horror to determine what its financial
loss has 'been. Various estimates have
been made, some of them by the officials
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
and others >by merchants quite as well
qualified as ;they to speak. . The safest
and most accurate estimate of the loss
Is $1,8CO,OCO. A conservative estimate
places the -value of the City of Rio de
Janeiro -at -a sum between $550,000 and
$700,000â probably the latter. There; Is no
insurance -upon the^ vessel, a statement
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
officials to the contrary notwithstanding.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company has
simply an: insurance fund of its own.
â¢The cargo- was one of the most valuable
which has been consigned to this port In
many months, and was v worth' more than
1500.000. 'The wrecked vessel carried the
new. ; crop of- Chinese . rice and was also
heavily laden with valuable silks. .' There
was also on, board $600,000 in treasure. Of
ficers of the Pacific. Mail, in opposition to
these assertions, declare that the -vessel
carried only a cargo of $200,000 and no
treasure nnd that the ship was worth be
tween $800,000 and $900,000. It has not been
the. habit., however, for officers of the Pa
cific | Mail Steamship Company i to give a
correct r estimate of. any- of the many
losses â¢ which the * company has suffered
through marine disasters.

i NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â Consul General
Wlldman's brother, Edwin Wlldman. who
is now In this city., and who was formerly
Vice Consul under .Rounsevelle Wlldman
In Hongkong, is still cherishing the belior"
that the Consul General and his family
may nave taken to a lifeboat, which
has been blown out. of the harbor, an 1
that they may yet be heard from.
- Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Wildman. who aro
now at the Everett House, communicated
to-day with San Francisco, after news of
the disaster reached this city, and spent
a terribly anxious evening In vain hope-'
that seme definite news of the missing
family might arrive. Mr. Wlldman was
in 'a very despondent mood to-night.
"I received only & short while ago a
latter from him sayin? he and his family
were going to sail on January 22." he said.
"It is a remarkable thing that this steam
ship was my brother's pet. and he always
made it a point to sail on her when cross
ing the Pacific. When I was last in Hong
kong he wanted ins/W sail on her. tooâ
he was so fond of ner. I sailed, however,
last November on the Coptic. The Rio
de Janeiro was the oldest and smallest
1 vessel on the line and I preferred to sail
' on a large and modern ship. 'My brother
! would take trouble to miss a steamer in
order to go on that ship.
"Captain William Ward, commander of
the shin was reputed to be the most pop
ular officer in the employ of the line.
The fact that he was in charge Induced
a good many to sail on that particular
vessel My brother was a great friend
of Captain Ward. â¢
"On this trip he took his entire family,
consisting of his wife, who was Miss Ueti
tia Aldrich. a niece of Lnlted States Sen
ator William M. Stewart of Nevada: his
two children. 'Rounsevelle Wlldman Jr.. 9
year-, old. and Dorothy. 2 years old. They
also had with them the children s nurse,
whom they took out from San Francisco
several years ago. My brother has
worked very hard and he and his family
have been under strain since these trou
blous times in China began.
"He- was much in need* of a leave of
"absence and thought that the health of
the children would be benefited by a
chance I understand he was to have re
turned to Hongkong In about three
months. I expected to get a telegram
from him upon the arrival of the vessel
telling me whether he would come on to
New York "or whether I should go to
Washington, which was his real destina
tion to meet him."
Mr. Wlldman said that his brother had
left Vice , Consul William Aldrich. his
brother-in-law. In charge of affairs when
he saj'ed for this! country. I asked him
whether, he entertained any strong hope
of his brother's oscsrpe.
"There Is a chance, that the family may
be 'laved.' There are very heavy north
winds prevalent on the Calif ornia , coast.
It^ is Quite possible that they may have
taken'. to a lifeboat which was blown sev
eral -miles , down the beach." My > brother
was a fine swimmer, but; that would not
avail much with ; h!3 wife and two chil
dren to rescue."

They had been married less than two
years, both coming from Baltimore. Their
devotion each to the other was so marked
that the young widow is completely pros

I Engineer MacCoun had been connected
with the Pacific Mail for two years. This
was hi3 second trip on the Rio de Janeiro.
The remaining months of his service wer*>

PILOT FP.EDERICK JORDAN
was In consultation with Vice
President Schwerin of the Pa
cific Mail Company for more
than two hcurs yesterday at
the Mali dock. After the pilot
was brought safely to land by
some fishermen who had picked him up
his Immediate wants were attended to at
the Merchants" Exchange office on Melggs
wharf, and he then proceeded to his homt
to assure his family of his safety. After
spending a few minutes at his home. Jor
dan went to the Mail dock, where VicÂ©
President Schwerin was waiting for hlm.
In speaking of his experiences Pilot Jor
dan said:
"I went out on Monday In one of th*
pilot boats snd went on board the Rio d*
Janeiro on Thursday evening at 5 o'clock.
It was very tossy outside the Heads and
Captain "Ward decided to lay to for tho
night. This morning at 4:30 the foÂ»
cleared. ar?d I went on the bridge and
ordered the anchor up. Captain Ward,
the first and second officers and two quar
termasters were on the bridge with me.
While we were heaving up the anchor
and just as we got under way I could see
clearly the Cliff House and North HeaJ
lights.
"As we got under way I saw the fogr
coming down again. I could see both
points of the Heads as the fog came down
and Cantaln Ward told me to go^ahead.
I could hear the fog whistles at Point BoÂ»
nlta and Lime Point- There was a strong
ebb tide running against us and the Rio
was making half speed.
"The fog was pretty thick and we could
not see the land. Then all of a sudden
came the crash as the ship struck on the
rocks. I realized that the strong ebb tide
had swunz us on to Mile Rock, but I did
not think for a minute that the vessel
would go down. In about five minutes
after we struck the lights went out. which
showed that the water was in the englno
rooms.
"Captain Ward and the officers and
crew behaved with splendid courage and
discipline was maintained. As soon an wo
struck the captain gave the alarm of n>e
and the crew responded promptly and
went to their assigned quarters, rap
tain Ward went from post to post to scÂ«
that the boats and life rafts were lowered.
He ordered some of the crew to get the
passengers from their staterooms. I saw
a boat break from Its davits and the pas
engers in it were thrown into the water.
There was confusion aa we had no lights.
"I was about to get down the rope lad
der to the doctor's beat when a maa
rushed up to me with a woman and a lit
tle boy. He asl^ed me for God's sake to
save his wife and child. I took hold of
the boy and told him to hang on to my
neck and I caught the woman and* was
helping her down the ladder when the
ship slipped off the rock sideways ar.d
went down head first. I must have been
carried fifty feet down by the suction,
and I never saw the woman or bc7
again." *
From the description given of tLo
woman and child by the pilot, it la evi
dent that they were Mrs. Wlldman and
her child. Continuing. Pilot Jordan said:
"When I came to the surface I was
dazed and did not know fcr a minute what
had happened. I started to swim and
caught hold of a big piece of wood which
floated toward me. I threw my arms over
it and drifted around until I saw part of
a deck-house with a Chinaman on top of
it. I got as near as I could and the China
man helped me on to the place where hs
was. We drifted around for an hour or
more until some fishermen came alongside
and picked us up."
When asked to what h* attributed tha
disaster. Pilot.Jordan said:
"I can enly attribute It to the strong
tide which was running and which drifted
us on to the rocks. The heavy fog which
came down on us as we were under way
prevented us from seeing where wo
were." .
"I want to say that Captain Ward never
went below, as has been stated in an
evening paper! He was en deck from the
time the ship struck until she went
down."

THE OUTLOOK
For a woman's happiness in the married
state, depends less/as a rule, upon the
man she is to marry than npon her own
health. The woman who enters upon
marriage, suffering from womanlv wealc-
Css, is " heaping up trouble against the
y of trouble."
Weak woman are made strong and
sick women are made. well by the use of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. It is
the one reliable regulator. It dries en-
feebling drains, heals inflammation and
nlceratxon and cures female weakness.
It nourishes the nerves and invigorates
the entire womanly organism. It makes
the baby's advent practically painless,
and gives strength to nursing mothers.

Chinamen and the quartermaster, of the

and then I knew I was safe. '.In a-few
minutes I. saw my comrade, Holtz, float
by on a capsized beat. We floated near
to this boat that Holtz was clinging to,
got him on the raft and then turned the
boat upright. We got in this boat and
pulled away from the wreck. We passed

According to papers Tound on the body

it. is that of Angelo Gusslno. manager of

Mr. Long thinks that not more than ten

upon being taken from the water Mr
Long was not able to give an intelligible

as I have only a vague sensibility .of
what happened afterward. Nearly choked
to deatU by the salt water, I finally
reached the top and was forty feet clear
of the spot where the ship sunk. Of
course the life preserver kept me afloat
and I waited patiently until relief should
come, whence! knew not.
"Orders shouted from the bridge
through this babel of tongues were not
obeyed, it is true, with that alacrity that
inspires one with hope, but," nevertheless,
the Chinese, â¢ .when they did understand
orders, obeyed them with promptness and
courage. And it must be remembered
that we had but little room -In which to
work. The prow of the Rio was under
water hack as far.aa the first cabin, and
on the space behind, \ which stood at two
angles, we ; worked:. When the ordcr.ito
lower away the boats was given the; men
responded promptly. I- managed to get
three women into, my boat and a few ;
other persons. On the other side they
were lowering away the 'boats, and as I
sawino one on deck I lowered myself, to
the ,boafc\ Then I thought' that possibly
some of the ; passengers had/not been
a wakened;, and" I -clambered .back' to the
deck." The. vessel, was then listed far over,

"Her great hull evidently, ripped open
on some Jagged pinacle, but she shook
herself loose for an Instant. , struck the
second time and her prow dipped into the
sea, while she listed toward the shore. It
has been said^-that there* was Immediate
confusion aboard the vessel. This is not
correct. Everything worked like clock
work, but necessarily fast. Great diffi
culty' was occasioned by the fact that the
crew of the vessel w*as composed of Chi
nese, and they could .understand but
little English and we could understand no
Chinese. ' , - . ; .
"We lay off the Heads all night, wait
ing for the fog to" lift, and it was at a
very early hour 'when the -order was given
to heave the anchor. We moved in slowly,
and though I looked , carefully I was of
the opinion thai we r were on the fright
course. So far as I could see, there was
no' deviation from the correct course un
til we had passed Mile Rocv and were
midway between it and Fort Point. There
we caught the swirl of the "ebb tide and
the Rio de Janeiro slightly deviated from
her course. In an Instant she struck on
what rock or reef I know not.
"Again the inevitable has happened
and the Rio de Janeiro has been lost,"
said 'Mr. Coghlan. , "I will feel the effects
of this 'experience/ if I can call it such,
for many days to come, for .my ankle
was badly wounded through , striking
floating wreckage when I Jumped from
the lost ship Just as she went down. I
cannot call to-day's happenings an 'ex
perience,' for it happened too quick for

II ; W' '. Â¦ of the Pacific Mall-Steam
||tfr ship Company, spent the
flfl q best part of yesterday at
' ' : -^\ Â¦ the Mail dock superintend
ing the work of taking care
of the survivors of the ill-fated, steam
ship Rio de. Janeiro. The first Intimation
Mr. Schwerin had of the accident was
when one of the employes of the, line
telephoned the news of the disaster, to his
residence. ;'
Mr. Schwerin made his headquarters In
the office of the superintendent of the
dock, and in, accordance with a marine
custom the various survivors of the Rfo
who were In the employ of the Pacific
Mall Company reported<to the- vice presi
dent. The fortunate officers of the ; Rio
who had interviews with Mr. Schwerin
told a plain story of the disaster, but the
most important statement made to the
official was that of Pilot 'Jordan.
Mr. Schwerin In talking of the loss of
the Rjo de Janeiro stated that he thought
the blame was due to Captain Ward in
bringing his vessel in during. a fog. : .
"Time and time â¢ again," said Sir.
Schwerin, "we have* warned our captains
nover to leave or enter port during- a fog.
Not only have > we- given our/ 1 captain
verbal instructions, but. letters have.been
written to them to* the same end. From
what I can learn I think that, It would
have been wiser for Captain ; Ward ..to;
have waited outside tin til the fog cleared Â¦
off. He was the only* man who had au
thority to bring the vessel In.- It Is er
roneous to think that when a pilot boards
a, vessel the captain has.no more "re
sponsibility. A pilot is simply a gulde'for v
a captain.
"The statements made to; me by Pilot
Jordan indicate that there. was a fog
hanging around, the Heads, and I think
i that undue haste was shown by the cap
tain In bringing his vessel in. I cannot
understand why there should, have \ been
so" much haste shown, considering the
vessel lay outside all night. Captain Ward
was a careful officer and I. learn that
when he reached Honolulu with the Rio
he waited outside the bar for eleven hours
rather than Â¦ take any chances in the
rough weather.
'.'Of course he is not hew to speak. J
wish that he-was, for he was one of our
best officers. He was brought up in our
service and we all feel deeply,, over .his
loss and of those of his comrades/.'
"I cannot state exactly the value of
the Rio de Janeiro, but It Is between $800,
000 and $900,000.- We have between $400,000
and $500,000' Insurance -on? the vessel, part
of which Is carried by . Insurance com
panies and part of which we carry, our
selves. I cannot state now in what com
panies we .insured the . ship. The value
of her cargo was probably between $150,000
and $200,000. I do not think she had any
amount, of, specie on board."

Schwerin stated "that .'he did' not think

Russell Harper, a newspaper corre

two hours after the wreck by Italian fish

Presidio reservation. Although badly in
jured and suffering: from Ion? exposure
in the water, Harper still retained con
sciousness. He talKed cheerfully with his
rescuers and said that he had about glve-i
up all hope, when they found him. The
lishermen sent word to the Presidio Hos
pital that they had rescued an injured
man and that medical aid was immediate

and W. C. Henrichs of the hospital corps
called out the ambulance and flf teen min

giving him all surgical aid possible undei

his request to the Lane Hospital. Harper
had his relatives, who live at the corner
of Washington and Buchanan street-,

be the result. Harper is suffering from

took this message of the night as- an
omen of ill will to her and her family.
The next day in all eagerness she watched
the western horizon for the coming of
the ship. As night came on and she did
not see it she became more anxious. The
next day she went again and with her lit
tle children watched for the vessel that
did not come.
There were ships on the sea. but none
of them was the ship which bore her hus
band. On the third day again she
watched, and when .darkness came and
she could no longer, see out upon the
waters she went to her home with dread
fastened upon her. and yesterday morn
ing she learned that in the blackness that
preceds the dawn the City of Rio de
Janeiro had gone down at the Golden
Gate, and that her husband was among
the dead. t-.--.v Â¦
Purser Rooney was one of the best
known shipping men on the coast. He
was employed In the capacity of purser
for about thirty years; first for the
Oceanic Company and then for the Pa
cific Mall Steamship Company. It had
been his grave misfortune to have been
on board three wrecked ships, the last
of which became his coffin. He was
purser of the San Pablo when she
was lost. For many years he had served
on the San Juan, but at the solicitation
of his wife he urged thnt he be trans
ferred to the City of Rio de Janeiro, and
yesterday morning he was returning
from his first voyage on that vessel.

FREIGHT CLERK J. G. EN
GLEHARDT of the Rio de Ja
neiro made the following state
ment yesterday at the Califor
nia Hotel: Â¦
*'V was working in my cabin
when the ship struck the rock.
I gained the deck Just as the ship was re
ceding after the fearful blow. I thought
that it was all off, and rushing down be
low I secured all the ship's papers. I
handed these papers to Purser Rooney for
his guardianship.
"When I returned on deck Captain Ward
was superintending' the lowering of the
boats. There was no panic until the final
plunge of the ship. The last I saw of
Consul Wildman was when I handed the
papers to Purser Rooney. Wildman was
in the purser's cabin.
"The report that Captain Ward locked
himself in his cabin must be untrue. The
last I saw of Captain Ward he was stand
ing on the bridge and was tying the rope
of the whistle to the rail. This was
done to keep the whistle blowing all the
time. I am sure that the ship sank so
quickly that Captain Ward did not have
time to reach his cabin.
"I saw two men lowering a boat on tho
stern of the steamship. I helped, and
turning around saw two women standing
on the deck. I grabbed them and we lit
erally threw them in the boat. Some
others got into the boat, but I was. excited
and wanted to get away. I just jumped
into the boat in time, when the ship be
gan to sink. We had to row like mad to
get away from the spot as soon as pos
sible, as I knew that otherwise the suction
would draw us down. ' .'"
"After we had got away, from the spot
the ship went down, and as soon as the
water had quieted we *-rethrned to
the spot where the ship had sunk. We
found two men on a life raft and hauled
them into our boat. We came close upon
another boat that was crowded with both
men and women. I don't know what hap
pened, but There was an explosion and the
boat upset and all were thrown into the
water. The screams of these people were
terrible. We rowed to the spot where this
boat upset, but there was not a trace of
them anywhere, and I am confident that
they were all drowned. We also saw peo
ple on rafts. " We shouted words of en
couragement to them. Finding that they
were getting exhausted and that we might
possibly drift out to sea we decided to
pull for the shore, where we landed This
wreck was the most awful experience I
ever want to go through. I think f shall
always hear the shouts of those drowning
people in my ears."
THRILLING STORY
OF RESCUE TOLD
BY A PASSENGER
William Brandon Jr. Describes Scene
Aboard the Steamer and in
the Water After
. She Sank.
William Brandon Jr., a member of the
London Stock Exchange and a cabin pas
senger of the Rio. tells a thrilling storr
of his miraculous escape from death. Ho
is at present at the Occidental Hotel,
where ho is confined to his bed from, ex
haustion and nervous shock.
"On Thursday night we cast anchor
outside the heads." said Â«Mr. Brandon
yesterday. "Captain Ward told us that
he would not venture inside that even
ing, owing to the dense fog. He said that
there wag no use in going inside Gbldun
Gate, as the hour was late and the
cabin passengers would be unable to land
that night. He said that should the fog
lift, however, he would move into. the bay
and lay off the quarantine station reads
for the quarantine ornqprs in the morn
ing.
â¢;I retired for the night and ?lept sound
ly until I was aroused by the shock of
the ship striking the rock. I ran up on
deck in my pajamas to nnd out what the
trouble was.. I was told by someboQy
that there had been an accident, but that
it was nothing serious. A Mr. Carpenter,
who was also a passenger, told me that
he thought that the ship was in bigger
danger than was generally supposed, and
advised jne to return to . my cabin and
dress. . I rushed back to my stateroom,
dressed, . took my money ana watch ami
put- them in my pocket, threw an over
coax over my arm and went back on deck.
I walked aft of the ship and noticed Mr*.
Wildman, the nurse and the two little
Wildman children standing near the stern.
.They were soon joined by Consul Wild
man, and from his actions he evidently
was looking for some means to save his
family. He was looking over the side of
the ship endeavoring to attract the at
tention of some sailors. who were out In
a boat. I went to the side of the sH"d
and saw that the boat was half full of
water and was commanded by Dr. O'Ne'.l.
the ship's surgeon. Dr. O'Nell - was in
structing the men in the, boat to ball out
the water. He also shouted to those on
board the ship to throw down some buck
ets for the sailors to bail with. The scene
at this time was beginning to get dra
matic. Several ladies .appeared on the
deck and began screaming for their hus
bands., The ship, I also noticed then; was
beginning to list badly to starboard. I
moved forward a little in the direction
of the bow *md passed two ladies. Mr<.
Wakefleld and Miss Wakefleld. To the
best of my belief they had life preserver?
on." ..â¢.â¢..
. "Consul Wildman was all this time with
his wife and seemed perfectly cool. Cap
tain Ward made his appearance about this
time and shouted to* Dr. O'Neil to bring
his â¢ boat in close to the ship. O'Nell
shouted back that he could not do so as
the boat was full of water. Captain Ward
then took Mrs. Wildman.: the nurse and
the children to a boat Â¦ that . was lying
alongside amldshi?. 1 . round a ;, life pre
server ly ine on the deck and put it on,
thinking that it was about time to â¢ be
looking out for myself. About the time
I. had adjusted the life preserver the ship
gave a sudden lurch forward, and: then I
found myself going down, down to the
bottom of, the sea. â¢ 1 1 can ; remember that
I, found; myself struggling Under the wat
er and also ' an . instinct : to ' save my Â¦ head.
I don't know why this feeling came over
JK. CARPENTER of 1229 Web
ster street was returning frorv.
Sumatra on the Rio de Janeiro.
He was picked up by the s=Â«?e
q ond officer's boat after being
in the water over an hour.
"If you ever were struck by
a ball from a six-shooter," he said, "you
know how it felt when she struck. I
knew !t was all off and lost no time !n
getting on dork. The breakfast call had
founded and I was crossed. When I got
out of rny berth tho weather was clear
ss a bell: th^n th<Â» fog dropped like a
curtain and one could hardly see ten feet
from the ship's side.
"Tho ?rcne on deck was terrible. I met
the captain, who v.as calmly giving hi?
ortfer* to his; well-disciplined men. and
asked him what I c-culd do. "Get the wo
men to the b^atF/ he paid, and I went be
low. The ladies were huddled together In
a hunch and were perfectly unmanage
able. One of them was bent on going for
her cloak. A? she rtarted for her cabin
I commandrd her very roughly to follow
we. I had to start!.? her to bring her to
her sonses. I think <-he was saved.
"The h>oat which the third officer and
I wrre in was struck by the wreckage
ar.d sunk. I fair the mast coming at us
and dived to escape the wire rigging.
When I came up I .cot hold of an oar and
later on a plank. The water was filled
with drowning, screaming women and
men. It was frightful. Of course in the
excitement of the moment it was impos-
Fib'o to dr> much toward saving- them.
"They say the captain wcr.t down with
his fhip. I hope he did. He was the
finest navigator I e\-cr sailed with and
the horror â of this thing would have
broken him down. The discipline on the
fliip af:er she struck was magnificent.
Every man went to his post and every
one did his duty.
"It was enly about ten minutes after
the fog dropped when we went on the
reeks. The cr.glngs were slowed down
rnd we were feeling our way. Still she
Ftrutrk very hard. We lay off the Heads
all night. At dinner last night Captain
Ward asked us whether we xvould be
willlr.g to wait for twelve hours so close
home ar.d we all agreed to abide by his
judgment. He said it was so foggy that
he didn't like to take the chances.
"Captain Ward r.as universally Hke-1
nnd admired. At all the clubs in the
Orient he had a standing invitation. A*
a navigator I never knew his superior. I
have seen him take his ship out of Naga
saki harbor on a thick n!ght when in
places there wasn't a ship's length to
turn in. I had made arrangements with
lum to take me ou; again on the 10th of
May, when I was foing out to the mines
with new machinery.
"I saw Mrs. Wi'.dman and her child just
before the ship -went down. They were
town below and the maid wanted me to
po to their cabin for the baby's shoes.
No cne seemed to realize how short a
time there was in which to act."

nEPBURX of Iowa is one of the members of the
House who has attained the rank of a national
statesman and from whom the country has a i
right to expect dispassionate and sagacious counsel oa j
every issae that comes before Congress, It is there- i
Â¦ fore to be regretted that he has permitted his dislike Â¦
m ftEzirjg at West Point to hurry him into extrava
gances of speech which show more of excitement than i
of reason, and discreiit rather than support the cause
The prevailing sentiment of the country is against
hazrrig. The people have read with iadigaatioa the j
evidence given by the cadets themselves of the treat
: ment inSicted by the upper class men upon the new ;
j comers to the academy. There is therefore a strong
['popular support for the measures now proposed by Â¦
Â¦ Congress for putting an end to hazing, not only at i
Â¦ West Point, bet at the naval academy at Annapolis. '
1 and Mr. Hepburn has the pablic sympathy on his side ;
I in urging the adoption of the measures. He cannot i
; hope, however, to have any widespread approval of
\ the speech he made oa the subject when the bill was
i nzidtT consideration on Thursday.
In his zealous desire to make a strong impression :
j upon the House Mr. Hepburn, after' describing the ;
' hazing at West Point and at Annapolis as "the cow- :
j :ng and browbeating of the j'ounger class," consist
i ing largely of " "brutal prize-fights," went oa to
! tay: "Why is the Navy Department 8oco men short
1 of its complement? Why have there* b'eeh "4600 dr
i sertions from the -army? It is because the men are
s American citizens compelled to serve under nea
schooled in tyranny snd oppression. * * * i Men
1 inured to the custom cf hazing are unfit to coinrnani,
I the troops or the sailors of the United States, "aad our
I boys will not serve under men reared in the unwhole
some, pernicious and damnable atmosphere of -ty-"
! ranny." __. .
XoÂ» all of that is just so much ranting. Hazisg
! is bad, but the American officer, neither in the navy
i cor in the army, is a schooled tyrant. Doubtless thete
I are overbearing men ia the service, and h -is also
j probable that such men give rise to a good deal of
j irritation among the men in the ranks, buijVuch of-'
! fenses are the result of a naturally bad disposition and
j cannot be rightly attributed to the training received'
at the academies. _ . .
Haziag and fist-fighting have been practiced "among.
] the youths of the Anglo-Saxon race from Im
\ niemorial time. They are survivals of barbarism and
fought to be suppressed, but there is* nothing -to be
] gained by exaggerating their evil effects. The officers
I of ' the American army and navy are not as *a nils
I given _ to. the practice of any kind of tyranny in .the
J command of their men. It is to tie doubled if there,
j has ever been in the history of the world an array
J where better relations exist between the men aad the
I officers than our own. In; fact, during the Civil War
Â¦ it was frequently noted that the officers selected from
civil life were more swaggering in. command and
more despotic ia authority than those trained at West"
Point. "
â¢ We ali wish hazing abolished, not only at the na-
I tional academies but at all the 'universities' and ' col-
HEPBURN SLOPS OVER.
WEYLER IN THE SADDLE.
I I ROM all reports concerning affairs in Spain it
I appears that General Wjryler has completely
lived down the discredit of his fiasco in Cuba
and has become the most powerful man in the king
dom. , It was to him the Government intrusted the
duty ol keeping order in Madrid at the recent wed
ding of the Princess of the Asturias to Prince Charles
of Bourbon, and that fact in itself -proves the hold he
has upon the crowa and upon the Ministry. In fact,
he seems to have become "a power behind the th-one
almost greater than the throne itself."
So swift a revival of prestige oa the part of a dis
credited leader is one of the notable events of current
history- When Spain found herself involved in war
with tbe United States the" Ministry sought to shift the
blame upon the commander who had mismanaged af
fairs in Cuba. He was pointed out as the man chiefly
responsible for acts that brought upon Spain a con
flict that stripped her of her coloaies in the West
Indies and in the Philippines, and left her almost with
out any vestige of her once great colonial empire. It
is therefore evident that with all his faults Weyler
is not, lacking ia courage, 'nor in a certain skill in
profiting by opportunity. At any rate he has man
aged to master the situation and to adopt a policy
which has brought him power aad leadership. '
The Spanish people are broadly di\-ided ipto three
partiesâ the upholders of the present constitutional
moaarcby, the supporters of the old Carlist party that
farors reaction toward absolutism, and, finally, the
element that desires ihe establishment of a republic.
The disturbances ia Madrid aad elsewhere were <duc
to the feet that. Prince. Charles is a member of a Car
list family. /The young King of Spain is in weak
healtlj.;* .Should he die the throne will pass "to the
Princess who has beea given ia marriage to Charles,
and thus ihe Carl ists would have the sovereignty of
the kingdom. Against such a possibility the people
sought to guard by protesting against the marriage.
The Ministry seems to have been too weak to grapple
with the situation, and Weyler came forward as the
friead of the court and carried the marriage through.
One of the curious phases of the situation is that
Weyler has been credited all along with having anti
rnonarchial sympathies, and it is said he has had a
large Liberal support on that account. Evidently hU
character is judged in Spain from a point of view
quite different from that taken in the United Sutes.
He is about the last Spanish geaeral whom we i
ever have looked upon as a Liberal leader, and it is
difficult for us to understand his action in the recent
crisis upon aay other theory .than that of a man of
despotic -tendencies delighting in an* opportunity to
overawe his . countrymen by military force and to
crush them into sileace at their first rnurmur against
the throne. .
As a result of his new rise to power there is a good
deal of speculation among persons interested in Span
ish affairs concerning what part Weyler would' play
should the King die, It seems to be Conceded ths
people would j not wilHngly submit to the .-'accession
of the wife of Prince Charles to the throne, and that
a revolution would break cut. In that case \yey!er
would be a man of importance .indeed, . aad might
even cut a great figure in iaternaijonal politics.
Tljis session of the Legislature is so quiet it might
almost be called a "speak easy."
An investigating committee of the State Assembly
has reported that the children of the Preston School
are rot happy. Is it possible that they are parading
their sympathy for the notoriously unhappy and con
stantly warring officers of the establishment?'

BRITISH AND BOERS
rATIGUED by the long duration ,'of a war which
they expected to end within six months, British
statesmen have tegtm to! seek something ia the
way cl recreation by tr mis g away from the war itself
and speculating upon waat measures to adopt to make
fare of the trails oi Tictory .after the* victory has been
gained. They hare now become aware of the fact that
to orerrun the Transvaal was one thing, but to coa
<jtser the Boers is quite another. They are dealing not
with a nation, but wilh a people, and they are won
dering how they may manage to keep that people in
subjection after the guerrilla bands have been
broken up.
la tic contemplation of that question they are faced
by the fact thai in Somh Africa the whole European
popclsiion is about 9C0.000, and that, fully 450.OCO of
them are Boers, whib hardly more than 400,000 are
Briton. It is noted, moreover, that the. Boers control
almost the who3e oi the rural parts of the country,
even- in Cape Colony, and are better nghters and
more "skilled in arsis than the British who live in
cities. Finally, the statistics for some years past sho.r
the Boers stand the climate better than the British
~an"d their natural increase is greater.
Such being the comparative strength of the rival
race? in the disputed country, a complete pacÂ£ncat:on
is going to be a very difBcalt problem to solve. Evi
dently- the Boer? will remain implacably hostile. A
permanent garrison strong enough to hold the vast
region in subjection would entail a heavy cost t:pon
the empire, and, furthermore, could never cSixiirely
do its work. Several plans for meeting and overcom
ing the diScnlty have been suggested, bet only ore
has attained rnrch attention. It was recently stated
with considerable elaboration by the London Satur
day Review, aad consists of a proposition to increase
the number of British in So^th Africa by state-aided
immigration until the loj-al population far exceeds
that of :he Boers.
In advocating the plan the Review estimate; the
tt&t will cost Great Britain upward of $500,000,000.
aad argues tie empire caa better sfford to expend
a similar Â£crn in promoting emigration to South Af
rica than to run the risks, of another war. By the t%
pendifore of so large a sain ia improving the country
and inducing settlers to go out and make their homes
there it is of course quite likely there would be in a
comparatively short lime a British population in ex
cess of the Boers, and in that way there would be es
tablished a loyal force sufficiently strong to counter
act the hostile element. In other words, ii is a pro
posal to establish ia ihe Transvaal a garrison of set
tlers instead of a garrison of troops.
The scheme implies state-aided emigration on a
scale aercr before known to history. It would far
exceed all the Russians hare done to promote the
settlement of Siberia. It has, however, the defect thzt
South Africa is not a country attractive to fanners;
and it is doubtful if it will ever be fit for ranch more
than a grazing country. There is another objection
In the tact that Canada aad Australia are eager to ob
tain irrsrai grants from Great Britain, and they would
not be pleased to see the mother country exert ht-r
i fell strength to tara iauni grants, away from their
; shores to Africa. Finally, it is dotibtfal if the British
[?taxpayer ctmW be brooght to favor the plan. To a
flarge majority of the people of the United Kingdom
the Traasvaal is aot worth the raoaey already ex
pended, and accordingly they arc not likely to vote
$500,000,000 more to retain it

ihe Miner and Farmer Must Pro
ceed in Order to Get It.
By Binger Hermann.
COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL. LAND OFFICE.
The General Land OSic* is only one of |
many bureaus uader cne great "depart- f
meai. It ranks In ieaiority*. la the j
Interior Department- To it li cca^ded the
rurvey and disposition. ;as weli as the
care and supervision, of the vacant pub-
He domain. Ia the discharge of these du
ties there are employed in office and field
curing the year approximately Z/A per
sons, ana these are f ouad from the ex
treme north usdtr the arctic jsun to the
warm currents of the south, from the
pnlf to the lakes and from the Mississippi
and the Missouri to \im PaciSe Ocean; and
soon it is expected that legislation will
extend Its administration to our cation s f
island posstJ^ioas la tne distant sea*
There is expended tax the suppon and
management of this- entire land system |
about SS.<M<m a year. For thejasi fiscal
rear there was received in casa through >
the General Land GiZce IUr>,7S*, this be
ing aa increase over the pr-evjous year Oi
njgx.iZi. The disposals of public teafla
during that vear amounted to 13,4i5Â»S?T
acres, an incrt-ase cf 4^71,474 acres over]
the previous year.
Extent cf ihs Public Domain-
It is frequently asked what yet remains
to the cation ol its unsold public domain-
It Is surprising to learn that its area if
approximately 1,<hIJ$'IAX2 acres, and of ;
tnis 154.74i.7K acrcj are reserved for va
rious purposes, such as for Indian and
military reservations^ national paries and
forest reserves, aad â¢ there still remains ]
undisposed of and subject to appropria- <
lion tinder the various land laws Sl7.135.bSCl
acres. This does not include any pertion j
of our recent cesEioas.
The landed area cf the United States i
after the treaty with Great Britain a?- .
prtg-att-d aft.TW/ina acres, elnce which
tine -we have acquired 1 *<Â¦.'.*- ,~*.O acres.
making a grand total of 2,tSlJSJ,SW acres,
or 2M&&& square miles, as the tern- Â¦
torlal area of the United States. This In
cludes Sb,K5,S.'Â»i acres within the Ha
waiian. Philippine and Porxo Rican isl
ands and other small cessions. Under the
operations cf the homestead law of Mai
la*. US. there â¢ have b*ea eater h3 by
actual settlers ia the iaterver^at: thirty
tight years HS.Â£&3,51S acres. This acreace i
would embrace an area ecual to that of J
uintty-thre* Sutes the Eire â¬f I>e]awarfc
or fbia 1 and a half States -such as Ohio.
I>eseTt or Arid Lands.
Having thus briefly outlined the public
domain and its raanajremÂ»st,-it Is a or
der to present the general character and i
the nature of the soiL This leads to a |
comparative clasEiacaiion cf the- public }
lands, iriiich has never. &s a irhole, be*n
oSdally dettrnsiaed, bat which must be
approximately ascertained by reference to
geologic surreys throughout large sec
tions cf cur country â¢ and â¢ from Iana-cpc3
surveys, as well as from explorations
and. preliminary 'examinations Â£s to
other portions of the public dciuain. De
ducting the Alaskan area from the figures
above mentioned, representing the un- ]
app"cpilated public OoniÂ£ln. and not In- j
ciuding the recent island acquisitions, we j
have iÂ£Z,lWM"J acres w!th which to cea 1 .
of this area there is found to exist 232.
17S.tt/j acres cf desert or arid lands, which
to become suitable for farming purposes
must "be reclaimed by irrigation. Ti-Ss
enormous body of laid is practically of
no value except as to portions comalni-g
a meager growth of glasses. To b* stiil
morÂ»Â» jrecise, it has been determined that
CSVO.OCO acres are absolutely -barren ana
irreclaimable. "VTCia.t io do with tie
body of the so-called desert lands is aow
the problem, and at no tiin* Has the
CueBtion confronied Corgress and the na
tion as it does to-day.
Numerous projects are proposed where- Â¦
by irrigation is to t*-. a means of recla
mation. By some a cession to the States
t* advocated, ard irrigation by State aid ;
and under State control, or by transfer \
from the State to corporations, trhic 1 !
shall own the land and make recJania- Â¦
tioa. A greater number seem to prefer'
that ownership and control shall remain in :
the general government, and the lands
being reclaimed shall then be disposed of
under existing laws or under further pro
visions to be enacted by Congress. There
are many who would be content for the
cation to impound tne waste water ia
reservoirs cr artificial lakes, and from
such supply furnish water to the owners
of arid lands contiguous to the supply, ;
and to this end measures are now pending
before Congress. Interesting data have
been obtalni-d. from whica it is now ascer
tained that aa available water supply caa
be sÂ«Â»cured whereby 7i, <*Â».*>Â» acres can be :
irrigated and inad-e most valuable for
agricultural purposes. California caa be
beceSted io the extent of 11JMSM acres;
Montana, 11,0'W.OM acres: Wyoming. ?.OCK),
000 acres; Colorado. *,W)JL<V) acres; Idaho.
~,CM.QM acres; Utah and New Mexico. 4.- :
BfigJMff acres each; Oregon and Washing
ton, 3.9M.W9 acres each, and Arizona and
Kevaca, tJBMJXB each. This would creaM
1 773.0Â» fertile farms of forty acres
each. Should this nuch-wished-for sue- :
ce Â«Â« i>& attained -there would ctQl remain
*Cia75.'W acres for future age and for in
ventive geaius to contend with if It shall
ever be possible to make any advance
over present conditions.
! Forest and Miaeral X*ands.
Another portion of the vacant public do
main consists of woodland and forest, and
this, it 13 estimated, may constitute about
16 per cent of the whole. Already there
' bavÂ» b*en 46.77I,12& acres embraced in
i tnirty-eight forest reserves, bat these are
i not included ia the vacant public land
now being considered. . There are, hew
ever, applications now pendingâ but which
have not yet been considered â for further
i reservation waien will absorb *4^3J*3
acres more for forest reserves, thus mak
ing It possible forever to preserve -to -the
nation for permanent use the timber
p'-owth and also to conserve the water
i supply. The character of the soil of such
reserves is chiefly clay and gravel, suit
able for tree propagation, but not for ag
riculture.
The Boil of ariother portion of the va
cant public lands is mineral, but this Is
Impossible to estimate in acres. It con
tains gold.- silver, copper, iron. lead, pja
tlnum, cinnabar, marble, limestone, gyp
sum borax alum, phosphate, asbestos; pe
i troleum and many other substances which
I are recognized -_as â¢ minerals, while coal
I beds outcrop . in mary places, even in
I Alaska as far north as Point Barrow.
Coal land, however, is not disposed of un
der mininc laws, though regarded as min
eral. The soil of tie' agricultural lands
varies ia tjuality.
Methods of Obtaining' Lands.
A last consideration is as to the meth
ods adopted by the Government in order
to dispose of the vacant unappropriated
public domain.
First 'may be considered such land as
can be secured at cash sale or by selec
tion and scrip location, without the re
quirement cf settlement- All public lands
in Missouri are disposable ander private
cash entry, though they are also subject
to the homestead law.
* Second may be considered isolated tracts
I which have been subject to homestead en
try for three years after the surrounding
lands have been disposed of. and which
can be- purchased upon affidavit showing
that the lands contain* neither minÂ«ral,
stone nor Umber, and are agricultural la
character. Such purchase -can be made
after a. published notice, "and upon the
public offer of , saie. Â¦Â¦ = In -.case of competi
tion the highest . bidder wjctsres the -land.
not exceeding Ift acre* b^ng sold to any
one bidder. ;/ - vr â¢
Thirdâ Tb^re are the > abandoned mili
tary reservation lands." which .can also be
purchased for cash upon public sale when
offer is made, at not lees than the ep
pralsed value nor less than Jl 25 an acre.
These lands are also disposed ' of under
the settlement laws.
Fourthâ Timber and : etone lands can be
boaght for ?2 50 nn acre la quantities not
exceeding 1W acre)?, which rau^t be In one
j compact body and unflt for cultrvatlon.

Mintral Lands.
The laws ia relation to miaeral lands
and minine rights are as different as
those relative to other classes of lands.
Mineral lands are free aad open to ex
ploration and purchase. They may be
divided Into two classesâ viz.. lode and
placer. Lode claims may equal 1SÂ» feet
in. length along the vein or lode, and may
be 300 feet In wi3th on each eide of the
middle of the vein at the surface â¢ Areas
less than this may be prescribed by the
local customs or rules of miners but not
less than S feet on each side of the mid
dle si the vein at the surface is allowable
The price is tl an acre. Miners In each min
ing- district are permitted to- make rules
not contrary to the United States laws or
to those of any State or Territorv. as to
locations, recordinp and amount of work
to be -done ia order to hold pos*e?<Â»lon
â¢ 1 L i f,^ so r^ u1 "^ that not less than
$100 shall be expended each year In labor
upon the claim until the patent issues
Placer claims are such as include all de
posits except those of quartz or ctber
rock in place, and no individual claim
sha exceed twenty acres, while 193 acres
shall be the maximum for an association
of persons. The price Is f2 .=Â» an acre -To
entitle one to a patent there must be
shown to be U0O expended uron the claim.
The mining laws of the United . States,

THE WRECK OF THE RIO.
CONFRONTED by the terrible calamity pi the
loss of the Rio dt Janeiro the people of San
Francisco will be :Â©o mztch moved by sympathy
an i by horror to attempt to proncmrcc condemnation
rpos - any one who may be supposed to be responsible
for the wreck. It will be the duty of the proper oS
cials ia drt time and by the well ordered processes of
careh:! investigatioo io determine whether any one is
to be blamed or whether the calamity may be rightly
classed among those iccidents which ocair despite the
best efforts of human virilance and care.
Once naore the gladness of a great holsdzy la this city
has been saddened by a fearful catastrophe carrying
with it sach a loss oi life as to ciord -srith gloom ths
whole cornmenity. The circsmstsnees ender which.
the disaster occurred make it the more appalling. The
sood ship had/made ia safety her long voyage across
the ocean! She had reached the port of her destina
tion and was within the harbor. Her passengers had
gor>- to rest in the glad assonance that they were at
the Golden Gate, and that when they arose in the
moixirg they weald see 'around them the still Tcaters
of the bay, and hospitable San Francisco ready-to
Â¦welcome them, ; "> ' :.t
Sea ar.d sky s;tmed propitious to their brightest
dreams. There were no storms along the coast.." The
x'inds were tpntt^ and everything betokened y the dawn
ing of a 'btantifrl day, snch' as can be found at this
season in no part of tic. north em hen::sphere_excep_t
in Califcmia. But a heavy mist settled dewh oxer the
wettrs, and the good ship lost her way, went -strong in
the gloom, and disaster came ' '_ ._. . -
Ia the sorrow of this calamity, there is some conso
lation in the promise that science Trill soon enable men
to &z2sd agzinst such disasters ia the fstore,"_&ad to
grids a steamer with safety through rach a charmel as
the Golden Gate even in the thickest mists.
Among the many experiments with the Marconi
system cf wire'ess te^e^raphy no~e have been more
irterestisg or more premising than those directed to
the end of devising a means by which automatic s:g
r.als can be sent ort across the waier trorn every
rocky shore that ships frequent. The plan ha; been
to establish alcr.g tacb coasts a transmitter that send?
ots electric rays throrgh the darkness of night and
the mist? of day. Ships prbyided and eqtiipped -with
instrcments for receiving the impressions of the trans
mitted rays woald thâ s be warned at once oÂ£ their ap
proach vrj&nn a certain limit cf the rocks, and thus
be saved from -rrreck. .-
The mrriaaisra oi Ftscb instrnmmts will of course
have to be o? very delicate construction, btit bmnaa
ingenuity has r:aster*<l problems as diScclt as any in
volved in constructing then. It is therefore reason
able to hope that atnerg the many driBftd ccn now
working oat the ersergies zni complexities of wireless
telezraphisg one will soon cis-cover a means whereby
thzt much desired result tnsy be attained. Â¦
St:ch is the hope science holds out for the mtaxÂ£
Tor the present all that oar captains and pilots and
ethers in ch&rg- cf ships ess do is to prcnt by the
dree.d lesson thtt hzs bttn targht by the fate of the
R:o. Hr.^a life is subject to accident oa, land or
sea, and frecrrntly disaster conaes so swiftly and ia a
Â¦a ay so enrspected that ro one can be held directly
to b!sc:e; bt:t a^ivays it is to be noted that when in
qtsry is made it is foaad that hed there been fail care
the disaster could have been avoided. The moral of
every srsch catastrophe is to impress more and raor:
cj>ca marikjad the imperative need of .unceasing vigi
lance The dscgers that confront humanity are rare!y
ever greater than fctirnasity has the capacity to avoid
cr to overcome.

"I can only attribute It to the strong tide which was running and which drifted us en' the rocks. The heavy fog
prevented us from seeing where we were. The fog was thick and we could not see the land."
VICE PRESIDENT SCIIWKRIX â
"I think it would have been wiser for Captain Ward to have waited outside until the fog cleared off. I think undue
haste was shown by the captam in bringing his vessel In. A pilot is simply a guide." /
CAPTAIN* HECHT â V
"The officers, crew and passengers all showed splendid discipline; everybody tried their best to assist each other.
Life preservers were thrown around in great profusion. Those who were saved were singularly lucky. I cannot express
an opinion on whom to place the blame for the loss of life."
SECOND OFFICER COGHLAN" â
"The inevitable has happened and the Rio de Janeiro has been lost. So. far as I could see there was no deviation
from the correct course. It was followed until the swirl of the ebb tide drove us on the reef."

It cannot be established with certainty
that Harry V. Austin took passage on the
Rio de Janeiro at Nagasaki, although such
is believed to be the fact. He left the
transport Sumner" there some weeks ago
and wrote to George A. Hanks. 540 Fol
som street, that he was to go out on the
Rio de Janeiro from Nagasaki as quarter
master. Previously he had been in the
transport service and for two years served
as quartermaster on the Sumner, Logan,
Grant and Missouri. Before entering the
transport service he had acted as quarter
master on the San Bias and other Pacific
Mall steamers. Hanks thinks there Is no
doubt that Austin went aboard the Rio
de Janeiro at Nagasaki, though he might
have done so in a subordinate capacity.
A report at the Morgue places. him among
the missing, but this may be erroneous.
Austin was 21 yeara of age and when in
San Francisco made his home with '.the
Hanks family on Folsom. street. His par

The Sea Queen. Captain Ike. Smith, re
turned at dusk after a thorough patrol of
the south beach as far as Pojnt Pedro.
No bodies were seen' during the trip, but
the shore was covered witn â¢wreckage.
Darkness put an end to the search, in
which hundreds were engaged, and the
boats came slowly in. They will be out
again at daylight, but chances are few
that many more bodies will be recovered.
The action of the water will tend to dis
figure the features also and make identi
fication difficult. .
Both the body and the wreckage had
been recovered from a floating section of
the cabin, containing six staterooms. At
dark six small boats were vainly trying to
tow this portion of the cabin ashore, the
tide being against them. One of these
boats also had the body nf another China
man, and it was thought probable that
other bodies might be found in the state
rooms, but Â¦whether the section could be
saved or not was doubtful. .
Thousands of people thronged the wharf
and every incoming boat was a signal for
a rush, against Â¦which the power of the
police and custom-house officials was un
availing, and some valuable property
must have found its way past the cordon
during the afternoon.
At about 4 o'clock a boat under the
command of Mike Sarraille, 614 Francisco
street, brought in the body of an elderly
woman, which was unidentified but which
was thought to be the stewardess of the
vessel. The body w*s fully dressed. This
Â¦was the last body taken in at Meipgs
wharf, making a total of nine for the
day.
With this body there was towed ashore
a miscellaneous lot of floatage, which
contained considerable clothing, carpets
and cabin furnishings. There was also'an
index to a "Letters sent" book, the cover
of which was destroyed but which con
tained memoranda of letters sent to the
American Biscuit Company, the Wer
thelmer Tobacco Company and other local
firms. The name Ed Mackwirth was
written at the bottoms of the pages, fol
lowed by the stamp "Removed to 819 Pine
street. San Francisco."
Boatmen â¢were continually bringing In
wreckage of every description. Most of
this had been torn away from the vessel
by water pressure, although some wood
work was so badly splintered that the
seamen who were about were sure that
there had been an explosion. Consider
able straw braid and a bale of silk were
also recovered.
About 1:30 o'clock' Antonio Silva brought
I in the body of a man about 45 years of
age and with a full red beard. The body
was partly dressed. A few moments
later Joseph Safflni of 211S Mason street
towed the body of a woman to the wharf.
ThÂ« body was clad only in a skirt, a
night dress and a rich fur cape, Â¦which
had evidently been thrown hastily over
her shoulders. Diamond earrings and
finger-rings of great value were on the
body. The clothing was of the finest
quality. The honesty of the. rescuer, is
worthy of commendation- - Both of these
bodies wore life-preservers properly ad-
Justed, and the inference is that they
were dragged down with the ship and
floated free some time later.

At the Occidental Hotel, where Captain
Ward generally had his headquarters
when in San Francisco, it Â¦was stated last
night that Captain Ward was never

WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.-Senator Mor
gan of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions has made a minority report upon
the resolution declaring that the ratifica
tion of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty is not
a condition precedent to the construction
of the Nicaragua canal, and that tho
United States should . proceed with the
work regardless of the existence of' the
Clayton-Bulwer agreement The commit
tee made an adverse report upon the re
port a few days ago and Senator Morgan
controverts the wisdom or that action.
Senator Morgan Intimates that the ad
verse report was made to conform to the
views of the President. On this point he
says:
The resolutions have my hearty approval and
I cannot admit that thePresident has any right
to direct Congress as to the time when It U
expedient to express approval o* his solemn act
of making these agreements with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica. ;"v\Â» , :
Â¦ This claim was made. In the committee and
his views us "to the expediency of action were
stated as grounds of objection to the resolution.
From this view of the duty of the Senate 1
wholly dissent.
In another connection he says on the
same point:
We are bound to asree with Costa Rica and
Nicaragua as to the terms on which canal
privileges will be extended to the United States
if. this subject is to be settled by agreement.
We have so agreed and the question is whether,
in ! a Fpasm of apprehension or under a subor
dination to the criticisms that British opinion
may Inflict upon- us, we will permit that Gov
ernment to compel the President to abandon
these agreements. They are honorable. Just
lawful and inconceivably valuable, and once
abandoned we cannot expect a peaceful resump
tion of them.
Morgan also takes the position that the
President has already outlined the posi
tion of the United States toward the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty by negotiating the pro
tocols with Costa Rica and Nicaragua
He concludes:
It is <julte clear that the President Is making
these agreements In the name of the United
States, defiantly disregarding any claim of right
that Great Britain could assert to the effect
that her, consent was necessary, to', such action
on hU part ae President. And. equally, he as
serted the right of Congress to disregard any
'claims Of Great Britain to prevent the acquisi
tion of such rights from Costa Rica and Nica
ragua andto appropriate money for that dis
tinct purpose. Beyond question he has bound
himself as President and as a plenipotentiary to
thoss agreements and If they violate the rights
of Great Britain or Bive her Just offense, Con
gress la alBO rjound to either undo the wronjc
and atone for it and repudiate and - impeach
what the President has done, : or/ sustain his
action. Â¦ , Â¦Â¦'_'.:' . .Â¦

MURDER RESULT OF
A WELL-LAID PLOT
MORGAN OFFERS
MINORITY REPORT
CHICAGO. Feb. 22.â Further investiga
tion of the death of Salvatore de Giovan
ni, who was found murdered on Grand
avenue last evening, has convinced the
police that the murder was the result of
a carefully arranged plot, carried out un
der the orders of a secret Italian society.
The theory of the police is that Giovan
ni was murdered to prevent his appear
ance in a murder trial In New York. Let
ters found Â»n the murdered man's pockets
show that he had been summoned East
for this purpose. The Mafia society Is
mentioned in the case, but as yet the po
lice have no evidence directly Implicating
that society with the murder. Jose Mo
rico, one of the men arrested last nlghj:,
who was found to have a severe bullet
wound Hi the mouth, Is believed to have
done the killing. Carlo Battisto, who
came to Chicago from New York last Fri
day and spent much of his time in the
company of Giovanni, Is also under ar
rest. A clew to the reason for the mur
der was found among the letters in De
Giovanni's pocket. One of these letters,
written by a man in St. Louis, spoke of a
murder committed on Mulberry street.
New York, to which Giovanni was a wit
ness.
It also developed during the day that
Giovanni was .i member of several socle
ties and had many enemies. â¢ Â¦ â¢
In connection with the murder, the sa
loon of Frank Morici, at 57 Grand avenue,
was raided by the police' to-day and the
proprietor and ten . Inmates were placed
under arrest.

ness and exhaustion. Whin she awoke It
was 3 o'clock in the morning and Fox
had not come in yet. Much worried, she
set out in search of him. All too soon she
came- upon him, lying face down in the
snow. ' Being unable to carry his body
back to camp, she brought blankets and
canvas and tenderly covered him over.
There he still lies, embalmed by nature.
: Mrs. Fox's suffering had now Just com
menced. Alone, far from any human set
tlement, without any provisions except
corn, her matches all gone, a great bar
rier of snow between her and her store of
supplies, her only chance of relief was a
vague hope that her father would come
from Sitka about the 1st of February,
should the weather permit.
Thus, twelve long, weary winter days
and nights she passed without light or fire
or warm food of any kind, her only com
panions a faithful dog and the vision of
that form lying cold and forsaken out in
the dreary waste of snow.
On the thirteenth day she could endure
the agony no longer, so she started for
the beach. How she reached there she
will never know. All she remembers Is
an ever present thought that she must
push on and that when she fell exhausted
time after time she would return to con
sciousness to find her dog licking and
fondling her. and dumbly urging her to
rise and try again. Her joy and relief
can be better imagined than told, when
the first sight to meet her eyes at the
beach was a canoe, and she later found
that her father had. but just arrived.

LINCOLN. Nebr.. Feb. 22.â August
Koerwitz. a farmer, kicked at a vicious
dog which ran at Mm as he was crossing
the 'street Â¦ to-day. He missed the dog.
both feet went up into the air and he
landed on the back of his neck, breaking
It. Death was instantaneous. The walk
was slippery and the force behind the kick
ceused him to turn half over.
His ambition was to be a lawyer, but
there were few opportunities at home, so
he had come West to try his fortunes in a
new and growing country- Soon he was
elected Justice of the Peace. The office
offered him plenty of opportunities for the
study of his chosen profession and he
worked toward the desired end with untir
ing zeal. He was admitted to practice
before the Supreme Court shortly after
the close of his term of office. . For more
than thirty years he had continued In the
practice of law.'
Mr. Cooney was particularly well known

MRS. CHARLES W. FAIRBANKS. WIFE OF THE INDIANA SENATOR,
WHO HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT GENERAL OF THE NA
TIONAL SOCIETY. DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â Tho insistent rumors of
the sack that for days have been going
the rounds of tho Cnpitol and the hotel
lebbies havÂ« been growing more definite
lately nnd behind them all can be found
tho bills intended to' suppress the nickel-
In-thc-jlot machines.
As soon as tho bills were introduced it
was common talk that money would be
used to" defeat them, and now that the
first of them is up to the third reading in
the Assembly, the coming of Colonel Ma
zuma is heralded abroad.
The bills against which the antagonism
is ' directed are Assembly bills 504. by
Johnson, and 569 and 674, by Franklin.
All of these are to prohibit the posses
sion and the playing of nlckel-in-the-slot
machines, along with a dozen other forms
of gambling already, prohibited by law.
; Johnson's bill makes It a misdemeanor
to have or to play a slot machine, among
other things,, and fixes the penalty at a
fine of not more than $500 and imprison
ment for not more than six months.
The Franklin bills make of the same of
fense a felony, punishable by two years'
Imprisonment.
Johnson's bill is up for third reading.
It is No. 58 on the third reading file and
bears the recommendation of the Judic
iary Committeee, to which it was re
ferred, that it "do pass."
Bill 569 is on second reading, fifty-two
numbers down' on the second reading file,
with two recommendations from the Ju
diciary Committee, one of the majority
that it "do pass" and one from the min
ority that it "do not pass."
The third bill. 674, is still in'the hands of
the Judiciary Committee.
It has been reported more than once
that a fund was being raised to fight these
bills, but it is only lately that anything
definite has been said about the amount
of the fund. Now it is variously esti
mated from $1800 to $3500. but so far not
a dollar of It seems to have reached the
hungry. There was talk of one proposi
tion, cf $200 for each man who would volfl
and fight iagainat die bills, but the offer
was refused with acorn. Then It was an
nounced, that $2500 had- been sent up to
beat the bill, that $40u had slipped through
tÂ£e fingers of him Â¦ who handled It, but
tuat the remaining, J2100 was at the dis
posal of the Willing ones. This also went
for what it'was worth, but when a few
of the more inquiring started to invest'
gate they declared that $3300 instead of
$2500 had been sent to the Capitol and
that some one was trying to make too
much of a commission out of the transac
tion. ; -
That extra $800 nvist have raised a lone
howl, for it has been echoing through the
Capitol ever since. Many have heard It
and would sympathlzo.with the defrauded
could any one be found to admit being
one of the number; but however unsatis
factory-the arrangement was it had the
effect of tying up negotiations, at least
for a time. ,
The plan, as understood here, . was to
concentrate all effort upon the Senate
when the bills reached that body. Their
course so far through the Assembly has
been no more nor IobÂ« rapid than that of
any one of 200 other hills not important
enough to be rushed through under spe
cial order. There Is a Senate bill of a
somewhat similar " character, introduced
by Tyrrell of Nevaaa, but. that has been
sleeping in the Corporations Committee
for weeks past and it Is doubtful if it will
come up on the file in time to reach'any
where near passage by the close of the
session.
There has been a good deal of talking
among the members of the Legislature,
particularly * amon? the Senators,' and
there have been threats to bar from the
floor of the Senate at least one man un
less he behave himself In a manner less
liable to cause suspicion.
Caldwell's Proposed Constitutional
SENATE'S BRIEF SESSION.
Amendment Discussed.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, v SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â It was with the best
intentions in the worid that the Senate
started to work to-day. A, file of constitu
tional amendments had been made a spe
cial order, and there was talk of flnishlna:
the Assembly file and holding a - caucus
during the afternoon- and an apportion
ment session to-night, but at 12 o'clock
all the energy and enthusiasm flickered
out and the Senate adjourned until Mon
day morning. , Â¦ Â¦
The net result of the morning's session
was a row over Caldwell'a constitutional
amendment providing Â¦; courts of 'appeal.
There was no objection to the principle
of the amendment, but when Caldwell ut
tempted to amend it by changing the two
regular sessions required to be held In
Fresno ; each year bv the court for the
Southern district to two special sessions,
a. storm burst. The difference between
the two lies in the fact that to hold rcc
ular sessions the court must come at a
stated time, with all Its attaches, and
must go through Its calendar: to hold -a
special session It need only take a run up
from Los Angeles when It pleases* hear
what cases it pleases, and then return.
Smith of- Kern opposed rCaldwell's
amendment. 'He said he did not' like th>y
measure Itself, but with # the proposed
amended added, It was an infringement of
the rights of the San Joaquin Valley, and
he would not hear of it. Rowell also op
posed the amendment, and. after further
consideration of the measure, It went over
to nexe Monday.. Â¦

sioners of San Francisco was recommend
ed for passage by the Senate Judiciary
Committee late, this afternoon. This is
not the bill framed specifically for th<*
ratification of the extension of the lease
offThlna Basin to the Santa Fe.' but
phould that measure fall of passage, and
the one under, consideration by the .com
mittee to-day become a ! law, the China
Basin lease would be validated.

Kidnaping.
: OMAHA. Feb. 22.â Pat Crowe has been
heard from under circumstances which in
dicate that he is soon to make a public
appearance, i E. A: Cudahy Is in receipt
of a letter; bearing .Crowe's signature.
The handwriting has been tested by com
parison and it is the opinion of the
Plnkertons, Chief Donahue and others
that the signature is genuine. The let
ter* Is' dated South Omaha, February 15.
but the envelop* indicates that It was
mailed in Omaha. ',Â¦
Owing to the fact that the letter is now
In the Pinkerton office, Chicago, and that
no copy was retained here, Cudahy is un
able to repeat It verbatim. -Cudahy and
Chief .Donahue have made" its'c6ntents
known; i however. Crowe explains in the
letter that he has heard that the Omaha
police - are looking for him and believe
him to be one of the" kidnapers of Edward
Cudahy Jr. He maintains that he is in
nocent and says that he has no knowledge
of the affair, with the exception of what
he has read In the newspapers. He says
that, he will drop into Omaha some day
and, prove himself innocent and that he
would' have done so long ago had he not
been afraid that he might suffer the fate
of the negro who was lynched at Leaven
worth. . -.'..-'Â¦.
! Crowe says that the Omaha people must
have cooled off considerably by this time
and expresses the opinion that he will
soon be able to come here with safety. He
makes an appeal to. the Chief of Police
and Cudahy for protection, and says that
he will expect them to stand between him
and violence. In conclusion he says that
he is much hurt to think that Cudahy sus
pects him of being guilty of the kidnaping
and expresses his appreciation of the
kindness Cudahy has shown him in â¢ the
past. 'Â«
"When I received this letter," Cudahy
explained, "I was determined not to taka
too much for" granted, so I sent It to Chi
cago, as I knew Pinkerton had samples
of Crowe's writing and would be able to
identify It without difficulty. A few day3
later I heard from Pinkerton. He said
he had compared the writing with samples
of Crowe's ' chirogrraphy and that .they
were the same beyond question. I would
not be surprised now if Crowe : should
show, himself almost any time. I think
the letter was written in, good faith. I
don't believe the letter was written in
either omaha or. South Omaha. It bore
the date line 'South Omaha, N6br..Feb
ruary-15,' but the postmark on the en
velope showed that it had been mailed in
Omaha. It was Â¦â¢ probably written some
distance from here and sent in a separate
envelope to some friend In Omaha or
South Omaha, who remailed it. This was
done tor-, the obvious purpose, of -keeping
his present whereabouts a secret. He
evidently wants to come voluntarily with
out giving the detectives the honor, of
having captured him." â¢ . . Â¦
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 22.-Ex-Judge
M. Cooney of San Pranctsco passe 1
away in this city to-day, without
having regained .consciousness
, since. he was; found overcome by
gas in his room' at a local hotel Tuesday
morning. The Coroner held an inquest,
and the .verdict reached was that deceased
had come;to his death by accidental as
phyxiatiort. :
Judge Cooney came to Sacramento two
weeks ago to look after legislation affect
ing the. San Francisco Normal School, of
which he was one of the trustees.- On

at 1:30 o'clock. At 10 o'clock Tuesday
morning the hotel attaches detected gas
escaping from the half-open transom of
his room. The apartment was entered and
Judge Cooney was found in an uncon
scious condition. Several physicians anil
a trained nursfe ,worked energetically to
restore him to consciousness, but without
success. His wife, son and daughter w6re
with him when he died. The only word
he uttered was what sounded like a call
for the nurse, shortly before he passed
away. ' -
Dr. G. W. Dudley, who had known Judg-j
Cooney for. many years, testified at the
inquest to-night that Judge Cooney "had
everything to live for," and that In nis
opinion death was accidental. Dr. S. E.
Simmons deposed that for the past two
days there was a eradual failure in the
strength of the patient, with the appear
ance of destructive signs of paralysiV
from an apoplectic stroke, which the doc
tor believed was the immediate cause of
death.
The body was sent to San Francisco thi3
afternoon.
Michael Cooney came to San Francisco
with -his wife from Kalamazoo. Mich., In

Rnd had been married but a short time.

.IN THE AIR.
The Germs of La Grippe Are Con-
veyed Through the Atmosphere.
Xo one can escape the La Grippe germ.
! because when an epidemic of the disease
is prevailing the air is laden with It.
The reason every one does not have tho
disease at the same time Is because the
persons who are enjoying perfect health
are able to successfully resist and throw
off the infection/while those who for any
reason are not in the best of health fall
ready victims.
The first symptoms are those of acute
catarrh, resembling a hard cold, and if
prompt treatment is applied at this time
it can easily be broken up. One of tha
best remedies at this stage Is Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets, sold" by druggists every-
where, and if taken freely, say one tablet
every hour or two for two or three days
the danger of pneumonia and serious com-
plications will be averted.
The Rev. L.. E. Palmer. Baptist clergy-
man of Ceresco. Mich., makes a statement
of interest to all catarrh and grip suffer-
ers. He says: "Stuarfs Catarrh Tablets
have certainly been a blessing to me I
have used them freely this fall and winter
and have found them a safeguard against
La Grippe and catarrhal troubles, Â¦Â¦ from
which I had suffered for years. I feel that
I can freely and conscientiously recom-
mend them."
Persons who suffer from catarrh of tha
head and throat are very susceptible to
La Grippe and such will find a pleasant
convenient and safe remedy In this new
catarrh cure.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
entirely of harmless antiseptics and may
be used aa freely as necessary, as they
contain no cocaine, opiate or poisonous
drug of any kind.

Consulate here to-day in h.onor of Wash
ington's birthday, but the usual erabas
sadorlal reception and the American So
ciety banquet were abandoned owing to
the Queen's death.
POLIT1CAL "don'ts" formed the
basis of the address of President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California at the
celebration of Washington's
Birthday at Metropolitan Hall last night,
under th* direction of the board of man
agement of the Young Men's Institute.
The gathering was a large one, every seat
being occupied. President Wheeler made
a. striking 1 Impression upon his audience,
and close attention was paid to his re
marks.
Robert Tobin. chairman of the board of
management, introduced Supreme Presi
dent Frar.k J. ICierce as the chairman of
the evening. The latter spoke briefly,
eaying that the celebration of Washing
ton'* Birthday had been chosen as the
most fitting occasion for a proper display
of patriotism on the part of the members
of that organization, and that It was due
to & suggestion of Father Yorke that the
kindled fires of patriotism burned each
year with more ardor in the breasts of
those enrolled in it.
Kierce eald he hoped that the success
attending th<? opening celebration of the
twentieth. cer.tury was but a prelude to
continued years cf good work in the
cause of "God and Country."
A number of interesting musical selec
tions were interspersed through the even
ing's programme, jsi^nor Martinez ren
dered a piano solo. Miss Kittie McShane,
accompanied by Miss May Stein, sang
"When the Snow Begins to Fall".: Oscar
S. Frank rendered a barytone solo, and
"Walter Beach was heird on the cornet.
President Wheeler was greeted with con
siderable applause when introduced by
its institutions, its meshes, it* quarrels and
ltÂ» prejudices. They Bought this country as
a land of refuse to eÂ»capÂ« from the autocratic
power of kins* and petty despots. They felt
they were creating something new, and how
**H they did it It It my purpose to tell these
young men.
ThÂ« lessons taught In these- tiroes of change*
when steam and electricity draw together the
ends, of the world, when Industrial activity
is conquering everything", when corporations
are absorbing other corporations, and labor
unions are absorbing the laborer, and parties
absorbing- the voter, rolling with juggernaut
moves â what in God's name has become of the
Individual? *>
The duty of citizenship U one of the most
es-cred enjoyed by man. It 1* necessary to go
into politics, but, it is not necessary to go into
a political office. Any young man who could
make a success of a political office could do
bÂ«tter in any business career. If you are fet
tered down to your bread and butter in a po
litical office, you will coon be the loser. Gov
ernment offices don't pay as well as busi
ness. Don't take, up politics as a means of
livelihood.
If In politics, don't put things Into writing.
Ee honest. Tie to men who keep their words.
If you make a political promise don't fail to
ktep the same. Borne of our politicians are
not as bad as they are painted, nor are our
heroes as great as they are delineated.
Don't bother with little things, but drive
after the main Issue. Many politicians have'
their careers .wrecked by meddling with little
things. Don't bother with personalities. Be
ware of the man who always speaks ill of his
itllowrnan. Righteousness will take care of
lteelf. Study the Issues and leave the men
alone. Don't Jump at conclusions because your
joWtlcal adversary thinks differently from you.
Study the matter and floor him by incontro
vertible argument
Don't beat about the bush. Use direct mo-

Of all the diseases known with which the female organism is afflicted, kidney
disease iathe most fatal. In fact, unless early and correct treatment is ap-
plied, the weary patient seldom survives. '.' ",, \
Being fully aware of this, Mrs. Pinkham, early, in her .career, gave ex-
Vustive study to the subject, and in producing her great remedy for woman's
fls â Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compoundâ was careful to see that it
contained the correct combination of. herbs which was sure to control that
fatal disease, woman's kidney troubles. The Vegetable Compound acts in har-
mony with the laws that govern the entire female system, and while there
are many so called remedies for kidney troubles, Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound is the only one especially prepared for women.
The following letters will show how marvellously successful it Is :

bled with a white discharge, and I also

for years as I do at present. Before
taking your medicine a more miser-
able person you never saw. I could
not eat or sleep, and did not care to

ent hunters have been banding for far

of the month was that In which George
H." T. JacksOn, Andrew Jackson,- Jim
Brownell,' C. Frank Ireland Â» and ? John B.
Coleman participated.' S .'' * .,. :"â¢'- : ;
As far as Wasco, Kern County^ these
five devotees of the iron barrel, traveled
for their final big Bhoot of the.' seas6n.
After a week of duck arid geese shooting,
they returned to the city last . Sunday.
with sacks of /sprig, mallard, widgeon,
canvasback' and teal. , Their hunting was
done over the irrigated lands.
Â¦ But It Is. not the fact that these keen
sportsmen brought back a long string
that - makes the shoot ; an extraordinary
one. Something happened the fifth day
out "which made"a" hero "of Brownell and
a romancist of Johnny Coleman. As
Coleman tells the tale it runs something
like this: : . . . . . . . .
"On our fifth day out," while moving
camp, A. J. Bone, on whose land we had
formerly camped, and myself : left the
teams and broke off away from the road
to find water and suitable grounds for a
nlght'srest. When "about "a" quarter of a
mile from the party we were attacked by
a mountain lion. As wÂ« had left our fire
arms in the wagon our position was, in
deed, a precarious one. It was then that
Brownell proved himself the hero: He too
was straying away from the wagon, and
our frenzied - shouts ' reached â¢ his ears.
Luckily the cries for. help were heeded.
Brownell came to the rescue, and the big
mountain lion soon â¢ lay breathing Its
last." .,-"'
That is the stcry Coleman has been re
tailing around town, and Brownell was
posted as the hero of the tale. But by
some accident photographs of the party
in various poses were discovered. Brow
nell killed a fierce beast of the. "marshy
desert" sure enough, but the fierce beast
was no other than a big wildcat. The
pictures show this, also the relative size
of Brownell and that ferocious "mountain
lion." -

The handicap singles tournament was j
played yesterday at the California Club

up to date, the tennis produced was very
high class.

there are but three left to-play for tlie
two handsome silver steins.' The three
players who reached the semi-finals and
finals am At Rosenberg, Charles Kuehn
and Grant Smith. Kuehn will play the

Gardner fifteen and won easily, 6â2, 6â2.
In tho first round N. Hodgkinson al
lowed S. Salisbury odds of half thirty and
| won easily, 6â1, 6â4. Rosenberg and
Ciowell played even up and although the
latter put up a godd game he was beaten
by his cleverer opponent,. G â 4. 3â 6, 6â 2.
Duval Moore gave Chet Smith a handicap
of half fifteen and after a close struggle
won, 6â 2, i 5â 7, 6â4. Grant Smith gave
Fay Beal thirty and after Beal had Smith
almost beaten he finally lost, 5â 7, 6â 3,
Câ 4. Ray Cornell gave A. Watson half
fifteen. and won in-straight sets, 7â 6, 6â3.
Kuehn played Lucius Allen on even terms

10â8. Moore, after winning the first set.
.had his opponent 5â1 on the second set,
but Smith won Â¦Â¦ the next six games and
set. In the last set Moore played a very
sensational game. Paul Jones had a
handicap of half fifteen on Cornell, and
won,. 7 â 5, 6 â 3. In this Jones' smashing
was perfect. Kuehn and Sperry played
on 1 even terms and the former won, 6y4r
7r-5. "â¢ v : : ' â¢ \ : ; Â¦:Â¦'â¢Â¦.â¢' :
JBut one match was played in the semi

was. too large. for an inexperienced player
like Jones to carry, as the: score show?.

TENNIS MEN
IN SINGLES
TOURNAMENT
A great deal of interest has been taken
in this fight, as the contestants are gocd
men in their, class. Hawkins has been
fighting for many years and has earned a
reputation. In his fistic <Â«\reer he has
met and defeated such men as Eddie Con
nolly. Martin Flaherty ,-Jack Carrig and
Kid McPartland, and has made splendid
showings against Frank Erne, Spike Sul
livan and other clever boxers. Hawkina
has. not had a ring battle in many months
and the prolonged rest has done him good.
He is training faithfully and should enter
the ring in condition to make a fast fight.
His opponent is not losing any time.
McFadden Is '.â¢working hard at Croll's
Gardens ' and is - said to be .in splendid
shape. The Eastern buxer is a powerfully
buiit fellow and. will undoubtedly make
things warm for tho local man.
"Kid" McFadden has a big contract on
his. hands.' He has sismcl to box two of

will exchange uppercuts and Jabs

Century Club. Their bout wilS be twenty
rounds in duration and will be fought in
the Mechanics' Pavilion.- Both men will
weigh in at the lightweight limit and will
fight for a large slice of the gate receipts
and' a decision.
Alec Greggrains is in receipt of a letter
from Young Peter Jackson, in which th*
fighter says he would like to meet Thur

man against the strong though not small
black. â¢ â¢
Otto Cribb and Dutch Thurston are very
much wanted young men these days, bus
Hartlng, Cribb's manager, will not match
his man against Thurston unless a hi,?
purse Is offered. Besides. Cribb has a
March fight on his shoulders.
the cleverest bantams now fightlnsr lrÂ»
this city, and to win it will be necessary
for him. to knock both, opponents out. Mc-
Fadden may find he has bitten off to
great a mouthful to chew. Tomftiy Gil
ieather is a clever lad. He has beaten a
number of good boxers before the local
clubs. Gilfeather is a pupil of "Bob" Me-
Arthur and he has proved an apt one.
He possesses a stiff punch and can taka
a grueling. Georgie Curran will be Me-
Fadden's other opponent. That he wH
prove a worthy one is evidenced by his
record of victories. Curran is a stroug
and willing boxer. He possesses a knock
out punch in either hand and has the abil
ity to land it.
McFadden and his- rivals have gone Into
training and ring-goecs are looking for

The McGovern talk has not yet sub

For a cross country raco the weather
conditions were perfect. The day was
comfortably warm, but a light fog tem
pered the sun's rays. It was a novel af-,
fair, particularly regarding the conditions
under which the rac^e was run. Each or
ganization had five representatives, and
the gross time made over the route was
the basis on which the time was calcu
lated and the trophy awarded. The Indi

STANFORD won the cross coun
try run, held yesterday morning
under the auspices of the Olym
pic Club In Golden Gate' Park,
but to Oakland "High School and Its
speedy runner," La Vallieu, went the prize
for the bent individual time. He covered
the distance, approximately four miles, in
the excellent time of 23 min. 1 sec. Con
sidering the fact that the course was up
hill and. down dale, his performance was
remarkable.
The race was run In "bunches." This
is a new designation for competing ath
letes. At 11:10 a. m. Zschokke of Stan
ford, Wesdahl of Oakland High School
and Garcia of the Olympic Club started
out. At three-minute intervals they were
followed by the other bunches, so there
was constantly a procession of athletes
clad In running clothes, cavorting around
the park.
The start wes made from the Baker
street entrance -and the finish was at a
point near Central avenue. Hardly had
college, school or club.
Stanford's gross time was 1 hour 57
min. 57 1-5 sec. Oakland Hlah School 1

hours 3 min. 24 sec. Stanford beat Its next
competitor by 1 min. 40 1-5 sec. and tho
Olympic Club by nearly three minutes.
La. Vallieu's run won for him a gold,
medal. His time of 23 min. 1 sec. Is con
sidered remarkable. He was In the fourth
bunch to start, but camo in so close to
those in the third bunch that the Judges
were greatly surprised. The time made

Warn and balmy, thÂ© weather was per
fect for racing purposes, the only mar
ring feature being the slow and suppy
track. This deceptive going played havoc
with the form of the ia.vorites. the two

losses of the last few cays, i
A better day's racing has not been
witnessed in many moons. The George
Washington handicap, taken in a furiua
drive by Sea Lion, was a fitting: headliner
to a grand olio of sport. There were six
starters in this event, the principal play
being confined to the i#-pounder Scotch
Plaid, from the Burns & Waterhou^-e
etab'.a. The griding had Dominick in
ftead of llar.sch on his back, and from
2^; the price fell to 7 to 5. and even lower.
Uarda went back in the betting from 1 to
5 jir.d The Frttter from, is to 5 to 3. It was
fipured that the heavy footing would mil
::at<- against the chances of the Burns
handicap winner, and it did. Sea Lion, a
reveler in any port of damp going, witli
E. Matthews and nlnotv-ilve pounds up,
also passed apparently neglected.

SEA LION TAKES THE GEORGE WASHINGTON HANDICAP
IN A FIERCE DRIVE FROM SCOTCH PLAID AT OAKLAND
Sam Hildreth's Telamon Wins the Washington's Birthday Handicap at Tanforan.
Dolore at 100 to I Lands First Under the Wire in Opening Race of the Day.
By Louis Honig.
A RACING holiday crowd kept the
turnstiles a moving at Tanforan
yesterday as it purged through
the gates into the stands, bet
, ting ring and paddock. Some 5000
people saw the six races, the Washing
ton's birthday offering at the San Mateo
track, and then Crushed and jostled into
train after train that came cityward.
All the color of a big 1 racing day flaunted
from the roofs, the clubhouse and the
grand stand that was packed with wo
men. The one event on the card which
went with the Â¦ day. the Washington's
Birthday Handicap, was easily the rac
ing 1 feature on the programme and was
awaited with a keen'anxlety by those who
did not hold tickets either convertible into
money or waste paper, according to the
rulings of the. captious racing god. Much
of Burllng-ame rolled into Tanforan and
crowned the clubhouse roof throughout
the clay.
There were two genuine surprises in the
racing, the first when Dolore, considered
a doe In the manger, beat the field in
the initial event and brought $100 for
every dollar, wagered on her. That was
a startling surprise to many, but the.
books liked it. , Even Jeff Wells, who
owns Dolore. refused to bet on his horse.'
The second unexpected huof performance:
came in the'big race'v.-hen Telamon. cut
through the cuppy mud and beat a field'
of the very best in easy fashion. {
This Telamon. with Henry in the saddle, 1
picked up the. Washington's Birthdayi
Handicap â which means Just $2233- net
value â for Sam Hildreth, who seems not
to be ab!.e to get away from big purses.
The race was won with much to spare,
Articulate alone giving Telamon any fear
of not reaching the first place under the.
wire. Articulate cut out -the pace and ran
a good strong race until the paddock was
reached. At this point Telamon, Articu
late ar.d Canmore were well up together,
but Articulate could not hold on and Tela
mon finished two full lengths in> front.
Canmore and Articulate fought it put for
truÂ» place, the latter winning. Thorpe on
Brutal. Charlie's first ri<3e this year, came
in on the wake of the money getters. Tod,
Sloan tried the overland - route, but his
train had too much territory to cover and
all Tod could do on Joe-Frey. the favorite,;
was a bad fifth. Telamon sold at 10 to L ,
A buzz went ur> from the grand stand
and the asphalt when Dolore, the- 100 to lj
shot, won the first race over six furlongs.
Goalrunner.-a prohibitive favorite, with'
Turner up; showed nowhere in the money.,
Doloro took 'the lead in the stretch ; and;
kept It unhraded. â¢ Bennett, who" had tlie'
mount, took things. easy and the" daylight
showed in a wide gap, between- Dolore and

brcupht out the good- jockeys -and- sorns
good horse talent. Prestdme,; v with. Sloan
up, was cuoted the favorite/ but failed
to land 'anything' cutside of , show, money.

O'Connor up. O'Connor got away at the
start nnd drew out Edinborough on the
bock stretch. Qn the turn Edinborough
led for a time, but Nansen passed in eas
ily. Henry on Edinborough and O'Con

MANAGER S. F. CALL, City.
DEAR SIR : Please renew the contract for our advertisement
under Male Help Wanted in- The Call . We realize that advertising
is to our business the same as bread and meat is to the human
system. We have been advertising in The Call- now for two years
and find that it brings us as good results as any paper in San
Francisco. We . have received students from outside towns who
said they saw our ad. in The Call while we were at the same time
running an advertisement in their town paper. We find the re-'
suits from your paper come not only from this city, but from
other towns in the State; also from other States.
We have received many answers from the Philippine Islands
referring to the advertisement in The Call. "
We are more than satisfied with the results from our ad. in
the want column of your valuable paper. Yours truly,

NEW YORK, Feb. 22.-R. O. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Business in the East . and particularly along
the North Atlantic coast, . has been catching
up with the rest of the country a little this
week,' so that in the few lines where complaint
has been heard locally of late the tone Is btt
ter. This comes I from the working off of re
tall stocks which owners feared would have
to be carried over -to next season. In build
ers' hardware the buying has been Â¦ notably
better and â¢â¢ the distribution in the grocery
jobbing trade has been given a considerable
stimulus. Even the laggard dry goods market
has shown a good measure of improvement,
though in cotton goods there is still much to
be desired, for. the larger buying has not
brought any Improvement in general tone and
in some directions the market is slower than
a week ago. ' From the interior advices are
' almost uniformly favorable, with a very heavy
movement of general merchandise and farm
Implements over the northwestern railways. Â¦
Activity grows more pronounced in wool.
' sales at the three, chief Eastern : markets ag
gregating 8,528.500 pounds, for the last week,
against 6,972,600 in the previous week and 2,-
WA.4W a month ago. ' Although transactions
arc heavier than at any time in over a year
the situation is far from satisfactory, as each
week brings a lower level of prices.- There is
little evidence of a better demand for goods
and while some holders of wool are sacrificing
stocks In ' order to make room for . the Â¦ new
clip, the actual supply Is Â¦ not materially de
creasing. I Purchases i are larger because of
the feeling that prices must be near the bot
tom. Unless manufacturers receive larger or
ders and reduce excessive stoaks before sup
plies are augmented by another clip,' it is dif
ficult to see why prices r should -advance, even
if they are at the level of two years ago '
.The; other: large textile Industry, is In- not
much ' better, condition. Instead of being able
to advance prices of cotton goods In propor
tion, to the high quotations recentty made for
raw cotton, the mills are meeting with light
demand and even at 'the reduction to 3 cents
for print" cloths, Â¦ there Â¦ is . no activity. - Many
mills have Â¦ already ; restricted operations and
more will - stop spindles â¢ on 'March 1. When
the raw material -was advanced to the highest
price in ten: years it could, not defy, the law
of supply/demand and prices, which ultimate
ly restored an equilibrium." Â¦:.-â¢.--
On Tuesday ; a decline of $13 75 a bale from
the top point i had occurred, making it possi
ble to manufacture . at a profit.
Footwear ts firmly held at unchanged prices

Failures for the week were 253 In the United

against 33 last year.
No diminution appears In the movement of
Iron and steel products. Mills are rushed with
orders and new contracts are taken at full
prices. Piglron Is freely bought and prices
tend upward; Billets and other partially man
ufactured forms are firmer, and finished goods
would command high prices if Immediate de
livery could be secured, v Lumber and mate
rials are in good demand.'.
i Grain markets - are devoid ' of wide fluctua
tions, although many reports are circulated re
garding the condition of winter wheat, but It
is too early to secure .definite information.
News from* India and Australia' indicates a
larger crop than last year's.
with 'good buying- of spring line* In the Boa

some orders have been countermanded.

reinstating William Price to the rank of
lieutenant in the Police Department,
fojmed a most interesting topic of con
versation among the members of the force
and the Police Commissioners yesterday.
It was the universal opinion that justice
had been done a most deserving and ef
ficient officer. No action will be taken by
the board till the regular meeting Tues
day night Price can be reinstated with
out increasing the number of lieutenants,
as the vacancy caused by the promotion
of Lieutenant Esola to property clerk has
never been filled. It is believed that no
appeal from Judge Hebbard's decision -will
be taken to the Supreme Court.
The ruling of Judge Hebbard applies
with equal force to four members of the
department who have been disrated from
seigeants to patrolmen. They are Bern
ard Harter, Michael Murphy, now on the
retired list; James Kelly and Harry Hook.
Each of these men was disrated several
years ago without trial of having any
charges preferred against them. They
each demanded the right of knowing what
offense they had committed so that they
they could face their accusers, but that
right was denied them. Hook In his in
dignation tendered his resignation, but
after three or four years he was re
instated at patrolman, the rank to which
he had been reduced. It is probable that
Harter, Kelly and Hook, whoarestlll on the
active list, will apply for reinstatement as
sergeants, which would entitle them to
the difference in pay from the time they
were reduced. Murphy will also prob
ably apply to be righted so that he can
draw the increased pension.
Another point that has been raised by
the decision is whether the old board had
the right to summarily dismiss nearly
two dozen patrolmen, three sergeants, two
detectives and Clerk Hall, owing to the
Chinatown scandal about six years ago. The
men were dismissed from the force with
out a trial and without being informed
what charges had been brought against
them or by whom. Several of these men
have been anxious to be reinstated and
now it Is likely that they will make ap
plication for that purpose.

BESOLUTIONS OF SORROW
D. L. Fuller, the real' estate man from
Brockton, Mass., who was victimized by
three bur.ko men in a room at 271 O'Far
rell street about a u-eek ago. has been
playing detective on his own account
eince. in the hope that he would not only
succeed in arrestinj the men but recover
the money he lost.
Yesterday morning Fuller was walking
aJong Kearry street, and at Bush street
):e espied the man who steered him to the
room and pretended to be his friend. Ful
ler accosted him, and after hearing his
voice he was convinced he was on the
rieht track. He demanded the return of
his money, but the steercr pretended not
to know what he was talking about Just
then a mm approached the steerer, and
In an a^gry voice told him to "Come
aJonsr."
Fuller looked In every direction for a
policeman, but none was In Eight. The
two bunko men ran up Bush street to
Clara lane, which runs between Bush aÂ«d
Sutter streets, and Fuller started in pur
euit. "When they reached the lane the
fteerer wheeled round, and drawing a re
volver threatened to shoot If Fuller per
sisted in following him. Fuller was un
dismayed by the threat and the steerer
thovea the revolver hack Into his pocket
and continued his flight.
When the two bunKo men reached Sut
ter street a car was going west and they
both jumped on it. Fuller was unable to
catch The car. but he ran after it as fast
as he could. At Stockton street the
bunko men jumped off and ran Into a
house or. the east side of tho 6treet. near
the corner. Fuller went to the house.
but was denied admittance, and he had
to give up the pursuit.
Fuller went to police headquarters and
asked if he could without a warrant ar
rest the bunko men, and was told to do
so and turn them over to the first officer
he met. He seemed relieved at the in
formation and intimated that he would
not miÂ«s his chance again.

LATE SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
OCEAN STEAMERS,
When William Henry, Earl Poulett,
died in London on January 22, 1899, the
succession to his title and estates 'came
into dispute. The old Earl was thrice
married, and the organ-grinding claimant
to his estate declares himself to be his
eldest son by Miss Elizabeth Virginal
Newman, daughter of a Landport pilot,
whom the Earl married in 1849. The Earls
second marriage was without issue. In
1879 he contracted a marriage, his third,
with Rosa de Melville, daughter of Al
fred Hugh de Melville, and the son of
this union now enjoys the estates and
property which the claimant will attempt
to possess by process of law.
The alleged Karl Poulett has long lived
among the London poor, supporting him
self by organ-grinding. He has given
some study to. the matter of the housing
of the London masses, with whose life
and hardships he is personally familiar.
The old Earl never concealed his hatred
for his organ-grinding son, whom he
characterized as an imposter. . He was to
opposed to his eventually enjoying his es
tates- that he attempted so to involve
and mortgage them during his life that
even if his son were successful in his ef
forts to be recognized as his father's law
ful heir there would be little If any prop
erty for him to enjoy. While the Earl'.-j
son by his third wife enjoys the estates
and uses the title, his claim thereto has
never been confirmed by the courts.' Â¦ Â¦
LONDON, Feb. 22.â Proceedings have
been started in behalf of Viscount Hinton.
who at one time played an organ in Lon
don streets, to eject the youthful Earl
Poulett from Hinton House, pending the
trial of the question of his right to tho
Earldom- An injunction will be askei
to restrain the present occupant* of the
family estates from using the title of
Earl Poulett.

Â¦ "To-day ls the birthday of George Wash
lr.gtor., the 'Father of his Country.'. ;â¢ I
do not know what it means to the chil
dren of to-day or the descendants of the
'ragged continentals,' but to those who
assemble in this house of .worship It
should mean much. God bless our coun

our Messianic principles."
Kabli . Jacob Nieto in a lecture last
night #iscoursed on the proper interpre
tation of the word "Chosen" as applied to
tho -Jewish people. *
"One hundred and twenty years ago tho
so-called ragged, uncouth, uncivilized
colonists, under the leadership of this
'Cinclnnatus of the West,' whose mem
ory ls celebrated to-day, fought and con
quered the armies "of England, for" they"
fought for an ideal â the ideal of freedom.'
Right and truth were on tiie side of the
continentals and under tha banners of
right and truth they won.
"It is not always that the race goes to
the swift nor the battle to the strong. It
is astounding what a mere handful of
men can do when prompted by an ideal.
The few hundred sharpshooters now do
ing battle in the. Transvaal are capable
of performing wonderful deeds of valor,
for they are prompted by their love for
home. ... 'Â¦: ~ ;'â¢>
"It is true," said the Rabbi, "that
strength can overpower weakness, and It
is also true that the fit will survive. Read
the history of nations and you will find
that many times have the strong wiped
out the weak; read the history of nations
and you will also find that many times
have handfuls of men been able j to with
stand the assaults of armies and that
great nations have been unable to con
quer email ones.
Rabbi Voorsauger delivered an address
before his congregation last night In
which he referred to Washington as the
"great Cinclnnatus of the West." Dur
ing his remarks he mentioned th& strug
gle now In progress between the people of
the Transvaal and the English empire,
comparing the efforts of the Boers to re
tain their freedom to the early struggles
of the American continentals.

They all fired and fired, making fairly

several other Jolly marksmen.
A JOURNEY was made to Shell
Mound Park yesterday by a few

Wieland was willing and took the post
of honor, shooting first. As No. 1 bullet
was discharged a red flag was displayed
by faithful Jungblut behind the re-
It was arranged to let Wieland shoot
first and every shot was to be marked a
bullseye, whether It struck the fence or
burled Itself in the walls. Slebe refused
find Jungblut was " forced Into service.
Wieland was asked by the crowd if he
was willing to enter into a wager. Each
man was to fire three shots, the man who
scored the most in these three shots was
to pay for a dinner for the crowd. All
were to try their level best. â¢

SEATTLE, Feb. 22.â No livelier, tough
er or more scientifically arranged ring
battle has ever been brought oft In the
Northwest than the one between Senior
Guy Robinson and Junior Paul Harper of
the University oÂ£ Washington, which oc
curred at the old grist mill, Ravenna, at
9 o'clock this morning. The fight lasted
nearly four rounds, and It was a whirl
wind from start to finish, ending In , a
clean knockout. The loser, Robertson,
was carried from the field.
The encounter was brought about In
order to satisfy Robertson for the Indig
nity . he suffered at the hands of the
Juniors of the State University when they
handcuffed him on "Wednesday In an ef
fort to prevent the senior banquet, which
was finally held after the sweets stolen by
the juniors were found in Howard Cos
grove's trunk, and the young ladies Im
prisoned by the lower class men had es
caped from a third-story window by
means of a sheet rope. ,
Robertson- made the affair a personal
issue with Paul Harper, a junior, who he
believed struck him during the struggle
while he was down. Arrangements for
the fight were made last night, and before
dawn this morning the principals and
their respectivo seconds and representa
tives, -timekeepers and all were abroad.
A ring Â¦, was staked at the old grist mill.
Marquis of Queensberry rules were agreed
upon. . Â¦ â¢" 'Â¦
From'* the first to the fourth round it
was a hurricane fight. Robertson almost
knocked Harper out in the first round. He
had him groggy but lacked the science
necessary to deliver the knockout blow.
Harper won because he knew more about
the game, and delivered his blow straight
to the mark. Both men were badly used
up, but Robertson much the worse of the
two. '
