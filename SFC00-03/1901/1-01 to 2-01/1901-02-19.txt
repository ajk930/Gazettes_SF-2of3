took the examination and failed, asked for
another chance and we called a. special

he must have got his job last "year

had a very poor knowledge of the subject.
He could not answer -the questions, that
is all, and it was impossible to give him
a certificate on hi3 showing at the ex

and that Is all there is to bis charges.
"This whole matter is a piece of spltÂ«

that as far as I was concerned there
was no appeal from the Commissioners'

at the end of that tlma wtfuld go before

I had changed my mind. 1 told him I

Mulligan Is Agitated.
"As to my record, it will speak for it

were child's play compared to those I an

"One of the questions required the
drawing of a and plan and one
of the men I speak of had a plan and
diagram Identical in every respect with
the one prepared by the Board of Exam

the answers were peddled around in tho

am perfectly willing to have my answers

' "The Civil Service Commissioners se

be in the. right, would not be likely to

many quotations from the Bible. Mrs.
Nation sat behind her attorney and spent
roost of her time writing upon a small
tablet. The argument was commenced by
the defense and Attorney Dumenil cited
aiauv authorities.

MBS. NATION'S MANIFESTO.
Mrs. Nation's bond was fixed at 12000.
She refused to give it and was taken to
jail.
Other witnesses followed in a like man
ner, and she kept up a hot fusillade of
questions, such as, "What do you keep
In your place?" "Isn't It a fact that you
keep all kinds of hell-broth?" Mrs. Na
tion could not understand the sustaining
of the many objections, and said she did
not think the Judge was fair with her.
Mrs. Nation was tried on a peace war
rant and ; action . taken- to place her under
bond by County "Attorney Galen Nichols
before Judge Hazen in the District Court
at J:23 o'clock this afternoon. ' The trial
-was the result of her crusade Sunday
morning, the warrant being sworn out' by
the Moeser Ice and Cold Storage Plant,
where she was arrested by the Sheriff.
"Will Moeser, one of the partners, was the
fim witness. After he had answered, all
questions put by the County Attorney.'
Mrs. Xation. who acted as her own coun-
Fel. opened fire with all manner of ques
tions. Objections were offered, most of
which were sustained.
| Mrs. Nation took her seat and Ross
' closed the lower sash and opened the top
sash. Mr?. Nation rushed back and threw
up the lower sash again.
"Take your seat," commanded the
Judge. "The Marshal will take care of .
the windows."
"He didn't do It," snapped Mrs. Nation.'
"You sit down and. 'tend to your bus
ineFs and I'll 'tend to mine," retorted the ;
Marshal, as he closed the window.
Mrs. Nation was surprised. She was
in the habit of having her own way, and
this was rather a shock to her. Se
looked at Ross as if too surprised to say
j a word.
I Attorney Dumenil referred to the New
j Jersey Equity Reports, which stated that
| a man had the right to abate a common
nuisance without proceeding through the
courts, but afterward, if the court found
that he had made a mistake and that the
place was not a common nuisance, he
colld he recovered against.
Assistant County Attorney Jamison, a
colored lawyer, made the argument for
the prosecution. He said the charge of
destroying property brought against Mrs.
Nation docs not come under the head of
malicious mlschirf. v He argued that tha
law of destroying property was the. one
under which Mrs.-" Nation was arrested.
He held that If Mrs. - Nation . was not
guilty, then every one had a right to do
as she did. . Â» .- Â¦ -

called before the Grand Jury to reply to
the charges to be brought by James H.
Kelly. %
Charges Fraud and Daceit.
Kelly's statements were secured last
night and he declares most positively that
in the examination held last November
for plumbing inspectors the grossest fraud
anddecelt were practiced by one member
of the board of examiners. Kelly avers
that Fred Snook, one of the master
plumbers secured by the Civil Service
Commissioners to formulate questions and
answers for the examination, "peddled
the list of questions around for days be
fore the examination was held." Kelly
also claimed that Snook had given the
list to Patrick Mulligan, who agreed to
let him see the questions, and that Snook
also; secured a specimen of his (Kelly's)
writing In order that Snook might recog
nize, Kelly's examination papers.
While Kelly does not have proof that
the list of prepared answers was also
"peddled around." a peculiar fact is dis
closed in comparing the list of prepared
answers and some of the examination
papers written by the candidates who
took the test. In one^instance the an
swers of the candidate are almost identi
cal to those prepared by the board of ex
aminers, even to the drawing of a plan
of plumbing, which competent plumbers
say- Is absolutely useless.
Kelly, with thirty years' experience as a
master plumber and also as a workman,
was "turned down" by the examiners,
while some men. whose answers In many
cases even a layman can discern as incor
rect/ received full credits from the exam
ining board.
Attorney George Collins has been re
tained by Kelly to appear with him before
the Grand Jury ; and charge deceit and
fraud against the* Civil | Service Commis
sion and the. board of examiners selected
to conduct the test of ability of the city's
Inspectors of plumbing.
The board of examiners consisted of
Charles Weatherby, Richard Rice and
FYed W. Snook. .
Kelly rna'de the- following statement last
evening: ,

Health for the past thirteen months, and

last November I took the examination,
and was the most surprised man In tho

examination.

' WASHIXGTOX, Feb. IS.â Nearly the
whole of to-day's session of the Senate
was devoted to consideration of the post
offlce appropriation bill.- So far as com
mittee amendments to the measure are
concerned the bill practically was com
pleted, although the amendment appropri
ating $500,000 for an extension of the pneu

The entire Question was passed over un

vision was practically tho same, as that
proposed in the last session of Congress
except that It provided for the contlnun
tl#n of contracts for i noumatic tube ser
vice which by limitation expire on June

provision and he asked therefore that one
of the advocates of the provision take
charge of It. : .â¢
Allison made a point of order against
the provision that It was general legisla
tion on an appropriation bill. The chair
(Beverldge) held the point well taken.

and various House provisions recast until
the total appropriations have been re

Nicaragua canal amendment was vote<l
down to-day. TJie bill will be reported
to the Senate to-morrow.
The Senate caused the reduction In tho
total of the bill by horizontal cuts on all
Important items, these reductions amount
ing to one-fourth in all appropriations of
over $5000 In immediate cash appropria
tions, one-third in Â£.11 appropriations in
excess of $300,000 for continuing contracts.
These reductions were made In all sums
above those amounts, whether they were
as the bill passed the House or aa it had

(i âBecause of the advantage
\^^7 which will be reaped by German
and British exporters there Is a
disposition In commercial circles ' to be
lieve that foreign Interests will oppose the
removal of the countervailing duty on
Russian sugar. The future action by the
Treasury Department depends, of course,
upon the decision which will be made by
the Board of General Appraisers. To
bring about a prompt settlement, it ls un
derstood here that the machinery export
ers, whose business will be seriously'af
fected by the application of the maximum
tariff o{ Russia, propose to join hands
with the importers of Russian sugar. A
gentleman who ls acquainted with trade
conditions' throughout Russia .explained
this afternoon the effect of the action of
the Russian Government.
"I greatly fear," he said, "that the re
sult will be disastrous to American, trade
in machinery, tools and steel and cast
iron manufactures. German and British
exporters are naturally delighted at the
increase of rates on American imports.
Russia, and Russian subjects have pre

and besides they have the advantage of
cheapness. Now Russia will, in view of
the prohibitive price that must be placed
upon American imports, be content to
purchase inferior articles because It suits
the pocketbook.
"The Ru?sjan Government spends be
tv. een $75,000,000 and $110,000,000 annually on
railroad material, and the United State3
has sold a great deal of that Imported.
I am afraid the Russian Government will
feel, irritated at the application of the
countervailing duty on its sugar and will
not feel disposed to place any further con
tracts in this country. Private interests
also construct railroads in Russia, and
thes<owlll naturally buy material which
is cheaper, even though its quality Is In
ferior to that of American manufacture.
"It is not a question of what the manu
facturers desire or think ought to be. It
"Russia purchases a considerable quan
.tity of machinery from the United States,
and American tools have created a mar
ket which has steadily grown. The Brit
ish and Germans will endeavor to improve
the. opportunity they now have and will
try to monopolize the market, so that if
minimum rates are restored upon Ameri
can imports American merchants will
find their market gone. This is especially
likely to happen in Siberia, which 13 nat
urally a market of the United States, as
this country is so much nearer to that
section of Russia than is Germany."
In speaking to-day of hla recent order
Imposing a countervailing duty on Rus
sian sugars. Secretary Gage said:
WASHINGTON. Feb. ISâ The
United States Government is
facing a serious crisis In
China, owing to the an
nouncement of the purpose of
FieM Marshal Count von Waldersee to
etart another offensive campaign. Gen
eral Chaffce has been Invited to join in
The expedition, which is to be mobilized
on a larger scale than anything attempted
In China since the original march to Pe
kirp. The general eo informed the War
Department to-day, and the officials of
the State Department have been advised
of the situation.
This German movement is viewed with
absolute dismay here, for it Is feared that
it requires an immediate decision by the
United States Government of its whole
line of policy toward the Chinese ques
tion. General Chaff ee will be told that
he is not t<> participate in this campaign.
He .has been keeping the American forces
In Peking ever slnre the city was pacified,
gtmply as a legation guard, and the Ger
man Government is fully aware that the
Ui ited States Government purposely de
prived the American contingent in China
Ot Its offensive military character and
withdrew it from the control of General
von Waldersc-e in order to hasten peace
negotiations and prevent, so far as it
could, the continuance of military move
ments against the Chinese, which were at
oree unnecessary and baneful in their ef
fcx-t upon the peace movement. So, our
Government, not having changed Its pol
icy, cannot do otherwise than cause Gen
eral ChaiTee to refrain from any partici
pation in hostile military movements, so
long as the present peaceful conditions
continue. But another very serious point
under consideration is not whether Chaf
i>e shall join the German movement, but
whether it is not the duty of our Govern
ment to exercise all proper efforts to dls
puarte the German Government from un
dertaking this campaign.
The Chinese Government is unfortu
nately delaying the peace negotiations in
an exasperating way and is not respond
ing in proper spirit to the effort of the
United States Government. Word has
just come from Minister Conger which
confirms the press advices relative to the
Chinese declination to accede to the de
mands of the Ministers in the matter of
capital punishment of the leaders impli
cated in the Boxer movement.
Cong-er's message touching the subject
of punishment gave It to be understood
that the Chinese Government has agreed
to exile Princes Tuan and Lan without
capital sentences, to . recommend suicide
to Prince ChwanK. death for Yu Hsien
amd Chao Chi Chao. imprisonment and
degradation from office for Chi Use and
Hsu Chens Yu. It is said that an edict
already has been issued to execute these
sentences.
A visit from the Japanese Minister id
the State Department served to give
coW to the story that our Government Is
casting about to ascertain how far the
other powers party to the Chinese ques
tion will indorse this proposed cam
paign. It was impossible to secure exact
Information on the subject. The whole
*ub.teet, it was paid. U to come before the
Cabinet meeting to-morrow, when the
course to fee pursued by the I'nited States
Government will be determined.
It is uneqvi vocally decided by compe
tent authorities that the American forces
under no circumstances will participate
with the Germans in the proposed expe-
one for Tientsin and the other two for
Shan-Hai-Kwan.
"Count von Waldersee has prepared his
plans for the new expedition." says the
Poking correspondent of the Morning
Post, wiring yesterday, "and it will start
next Saturday. All the powers, except
Russia and the United States have agreed
to allow their forces to join."

Statement That Plans Are Not
LONDON, Feb. 18.â In the House' of
Commons to-day the refusal of Lord Cran
borne, the Under Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, to answer questions con
cerning which notice had not previously
been given, gave John Dillon, Irish Na
tionalist, the chance to move an adjourn
ment of the House In order to debate tho
subject. Dillon declared that the Under
Secretary of the Foreign Office had been
muzzled. . Â¦
Mr. Balfour. in defending the course of
Lord Cranborne, said the practice of crosj
examining the Foreign Secretary was
dangerous and would preclude the carry
ing on of delicate negotiations and might
endanger the interests of the nations and
possibly the peace of Europe.
The House then divided as follows: For
adjournment, 204; against, 249.
Lord Cranborne, when the debate on the
address in reply to the King's speech from
the throne was resumed, said commercial
interest was Great Britain's principal in
terest in China. Thero had been great
delay in the settlement of affairs in China,
but such delay must be expected in deal
ing with the Chinese. As to the question
ot Indemnity, Lord Cranborne said the
British Minister at Peking. Sir Ernest
Satow, had been Instructed to gather to
gether the claims that were to be made.
Referring to the railroad dispute. Lord
Cranborne said Russia had assured the
Government that the occupation of the
Peking-Shanhalkwan railroad was onlv
temporary and that the railroad and ma
terials would be restored at the end of tlie
occupation.
Lord Cranborne added: "I am bound to
say that in all our dealing with the Rus
sian Government in this matter we have
been received in the most friendly way.
We have no complaint whatever to make
against the Government of the Czar."'
Continuing, Lord Cranborno said Rus
sia had assured the Government that any
agreement between Russia and China re
specting the occupation of Manchuria was
in the nature of a modus Vivendi, to pre
vent disturbances along the frontiers and
railroad. It was purely temporary, and
although a guarantee was expected by
Russia that these disturbances would not
break out again, " that guarantee would
not take the form of territorial acquisi
tion, or a virtual protectorate.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt asked: "IÂ«
it true that an expedition into the interior
of China has been ordered bv Count von
Waldersee? and if so, how does the order
affect our troops? At the end of such an
operation we might find ourselves in an
other guerrilla war among a population
far greater than the. Boers." .
Lord Cranborne replied that so far as
the Government was aware no power was
contemplating an expedition into the Inte
rior of China. If It was so. the British
commanders would require fresh instruc
tions. . . â¢ -
dition. and although it cannot be learned
thit General ChaXfee has yet received in
structions to that effect, he undoubtedly
will have them very shortly.
The United States Government stands
steadfastly by the principles laid down in
Secretary Hay's letter of July 3 last.
MINISTERS RENEW DEMANDS.
Jlsanwhile Preparations Proceed for
a Foreign Expedition.
PEKING. Feb. 1*.-The foreign envoys
have held a conference regarding the
Chinese reply concerning the punishment
of the guilty persons named' by the pow
ers. The reply was considered unsatls-'
factory and the envoys decided to insist
upon a compliance with their original de
mands.
This decision and the objections urged
by tho envoys to the latter imperial edict
were unanimous and the dean of the dip
lomatic corps will inform the Chinese
plenipotentiaries that. the former require
ment? must be strictly complied with.
Meanwhile great preparations are being
made by the various commanders prepar
atory to the big expedition. Apparently
the only commanders who have enough of
anything for a long campaign are the
American, British and Japanese. The oth
ers are deficient, especially the Germans,
although Count von Waldersee believes
that in a few days he will have all the
supplies really necessary. He takes the
position that it will be better to Becure
the greater part of the provisions from
the country itself, but most of the gener
als think it unwise to take so great a risk
The British will rely almost entirely
upon pack trains. Any other method of
transportation through the mountain
parses would probably be impossible, as,
according to Information received here,
the Chinese have prepared for just this
contingency and have blocked every pos
sible pass with big bowlders, in order to
render the passage of artillery next to
impossible.
Many people In Peking say that Count
von Waldersee is "working a bluff" in
co-operation with the foreign envoys, hop
ing to compel the Chinese plenipoten
tiaries to comply with the demands of the
powers. The military authorities say this
may be the case, but China would never
believe the foreigners again if they failed
to send an expedition alter Dr. Mumm
yon Schwarzensteln personally notified Li
Hung Chang that it would be done in case
the Chinese court did not accede to the
demands cf the powers.
Prince Ching and Li Hung Chang arÂ«
greatly worried.

WASHINGTON^ FebnsAThe" bill to au
thorize the; hoMJng.-of.~the international
exhibition . oÂ£_the cent.enplal anniversary
of the Louisiana purchase at St. Louis in
1S03. and appropriating $5,000,000 therefor,
passed the House to-day under 'suspen
sion of the rules, by a vote of 191 to 41.
The opposition was hopelessly! In the mi
nority and the struggle over the bill was
brief. The question of closing the expo
sition on Sunday was not mentionted dur
ing, the. debate. The bill to define the
ward ''conspiracy" in the Sherman anti
trust law to avoid the possibility of its be r
ing held applicable to labor organizations
was defeated by almost a two-thirds vote.
The sundry civl bill was under considera
tion-late in the day, and Cannon took oc
casion to make a detailed statement of
the of the present. Con
gress. He was led i to this, he said, by
many criticisms of the reckless extrava
gance of this Congress. T-he situation, ho
eaid, was quite bad enough without ex
aggerating'it./,\ , it _
Immediately after the reading of the
Journal Tawney of Minneapolis, chairman
of the .'special committee on the Louisiana
purchase' exposition, moved the passage
under suspension of the rules of the bill
appropriating $5,000,000 for the exposition.
â¢A second was demanded and ordered,
â¢which action alldwed twenty minutes' de
.bate on a side. Before the debate began
Lattimer of South Carolina asked unani
mous consent to offer the Charleston (S.
C.) exposition bill as an amendment, but
Hopkins of Illinois objected.
' Tawney dilated upon the great and over
shadowing importance of the event which
this. proposed exposition was to celebrate,
calling attention to 'the fact that of all
expositions held in this country Congress
had authorized but two^-the Centennial
celebration at Philadelphia and the Ex
position at Chicago â to commemorate the
fotir hundredth anniversary of the discov
ery , of .America. 'Congress, he said, had
only provided for Its own exhibit at other
expositions. The magnitude of the event
to be celebrated at St. Louis made' it
proper that Congress should authorize it.
Maddox of Georgia opposed the bill, but
said he did not imagine his opposition
would avail.
I "It ought not to," cried Tawney, "in
view of the contract we made at the last
session."
"I want to talk about other contracts
just as binding," replied Maddox, who
proceeded to recall the manner in which
Canno'ri. chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, was fighting honest claims.
"Moreover." he said, "there are to be
no public buildings authorized by this
Congress on account of the growth of ex
penditures. The $5,000,000 which Congress
would give to a private enterprise by this
bill." he said, "would build fifty necessary
public buildings." He was anxious, he
said, to see where the "watch dog of the
treasury." Cannon, stood on this bill.
Sims of Tennessee, who followed Mad
dox, taunted Cannon with fighting honest
claims of a few hundred dollars and then
remaining quiescent when such a bill aa
the pending one was before the House
He declared' that Cannon, if he would ex
ert his influence, could defeat this meas
ure. Sims declared that no exposition bill
was justifiable, and he appealed to his
Democratic colleagues not to vote for tho
pending, meaaure. Â»
Cannon said he hadf consistently 'and
persistently opposed, siich legislation. Ho
agreed that exposition matters had run
wild.. But this bill was now upon a toot
ing where it could not be disregarded; Ho
had opposed the paragraph in the sundrv
civil bill at the last session. , It had been
placed upon the bill by Senator Cockrell
a Democrat, in the Senate. He had op
posed it with voice and vote, but it had
become a law. St. Louis had complied
with Its part oZ the contract and the
Government was obligated to comply also.
He should, therefore, vote for the pending
The bill was then placed upon its pass
age, .a roll call being demanded, from all
sides.
The bill was passed. 191 to 41-more than
â¢the requisite two-thirds.
L-ittlefleld of Maine then moved to pass
under suspension of tho rules the bill to
denne the meaning of the word "conspir
acy and to regulate the use of restrain
ing orders as proposed to be amended by
the. committee. .. Llttlefleld said the 'bill*
was designed to exempt labor unions from
the operation of the conspiracy clause of
the Sherman anti-trust act, but confined
the exemptions within certain limitations
by the operations of the amendments
which the Judiciary Committee recom
mended, as follows:
"Provided, that the provisions of this
act shall not apply to threats to injure
the person or the property, business or
occupation of any person, firm, associa
tion or corporation through intimidation
or coercion: nor' to any acts causing or
intending to cause an illegal Interference
by overt acts with the rights of others,
and. to omit from the bill the following
words, 'nor shall such agreement, combi
nation or contract be considered as in re
straint of trade or commerce.' "
Berry of Arkansas argued that the
amendments proposed by the committee
would, destroy the purpose of the bill, the
object for which the labor ! organiza
tions were striving. They would, he said,
place it in the power of. the courts to de
cide that any act of the labor organiza
tions was an "overt act."
Fleming of Georgia, aaid that within ten
minutes Samuel Oompers, president of the
Federation of Labor, had stated that he
would prefer that the. bill should be, de
feated rather than pass with the amend
ments. The bill was defeated. 56 to 145.
The House then resumed consideration
of the sundry civil appropriation bill. The
pending question was a point of order
raised against an amendment offered by
Cowherd 'of Missouri to appropriate $30
000 for food and supplies for the natives
of;- Alaska. Hopkins, who was in the
chair, sustained the point of order.
Cannon, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, made a general statement re
garding the status of the/ appropriations
for this session. He was led to make it,
he said, by remarks made \n the Senate.
He said the situation was quite bad
enough without exaggerating- it. Cannon
presented a detailed table showing the to
tal appropriation bills up to date* This
showed, a grand total of $634,118,595, omit
ting the $53,000,000 sinking fund. This
grand total is $26,255,209 below the esti
mates; which aggregated $720,374,804 exclu

DEFENDS RUSSIA'S ACTION.
Embassador Cassini Speaks of the
Maximum Bates Imposed.
WASHINGTON. Feb. lS.-Count Cas
pinl. the Russian Embassador. made the
following etatement concerning the pres
ent Russian tariff situation:
"Russia does not want nor has she any
intention of engaging in a tariff war wlfh
the United States. The application of
maximum rates to American cast-tron and
steel manufactures, machinery and toola
was not dictated by any desire to embark
upon a policy of vengeance because of ths
decision of the Secretary of the Treasut y
to collect the countervailing duty on Rus
sian sugar. As I have said, Russia's feel
ings for tho United States are, as they
have always been, of the most cordial
character.
"I am sure that my Government and tho
Russian people regret deeply that it wai
necessary to Impose the maximum rates
American goods are highly appreciated
In Russia, not only because of their
cheapness, but because of their superior
quality, and besides they come from a
land In which wÂ© have a most friendly
interest. Yet It was impossible for my
Government to do other than it has done.
Our commercial interests- demanded pro
tection.
"Russia has always strongly desired to
Increase her commerce with the United
States and It has given us pleasure to
witness its growth. Consequently, we re
gret the more deeply that anything should
have occurred to hamper Its development.
So I am confident that the action take**
In applying maximum rates to certain
American imports has no reference what
ever to Russia's historical attitude of
friendship for the United States and 't
will continue to be our policy to malntala
thÂ« cordial relations which exist."

LONDON. Feb. 1?.â There is consider

States and Russia. The advocntes of a

to find In them some support of their con
tentions that retaliatory duties ought to
be imposed on countries taxlner British

"Some Americans, including Secretary
Gafce. appear to think the United States

but they have been, sharply reminded- by
Russia that two can play at the tramp, of
hostile tariffs. A3 .the import ot Russian

NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â Great surprise
was expressed In financial circles to-day
at the value placed upon the estate .of
the late OolllsT. Huntington by the ex
ecutors,' a3 Indicated by the payment of
the Inheritance tax. The announcement
that a- tax of $700,000 had been anticipated
was accepted as fixing the value of the
estate at $70,000,000. The Increase of
nearly $10,000,000, ' resulting from the
recent rise in the market price of South
ern I'aciflc securities, was accepted as
equally true. . -
While the tax paid Is credited upon the
books of tho. Controller as $700,000, the
check which was* - given by "Isaac T.
Gates for the executors amounted to
$663,000, there having been an allowance
of five per cent because of the payment
of the tax within six .months after the
death of | the testator. Controller Coler
to-day acknowledged the receipt of the
check.
Simon Strassberger and Delcour S.
Potter will act as attorneys Â¦ for the
appraisers. Miller. Peckharn & King will
represent vthe executors. A final agree
ment as to the appraisement may not
be reached for many months.
It Is expected that a schedule may be
sent to the State Controller In about two
weeks, and with It will go a suggestion
from the surrogate as to who shall act as
appraiser. There are five collateral In
heritance tax appraisers in New Tork.
any one of whom may be chosen. They
are Â¦ Robert Mazet. William Halpin.

GREAT SURPRISE
TO CAPITALISTS
day of Premier Dunsmulr, chief owner of
the mines, he haa, been almost continu
ously at the mouth of the shaft or In the
company's office, personally Inspecting
the measures of relief being put into
force and occasionally making a sugges
tion to the foreman of the relief gang.
These will be the last bodies Â¦ recovered,
but many Of those In the upper levels will
be -taken out to-morrow and "Wednesday,

men when running In two shifts.. >'

working and It Is estimated that there Is
forty-eight hours K work ahead for them.
- Elnce the arrival at Cumberland yester
To-night the force of men is being In
creased and by to-morrow It is expected
that sufficient headway will have been
made to recover the first body. The min
ers in the nearest workings to No. 5, in
No. 6 were Munroe and Alclnnes, and it
is expected that the bodies of these men
will be the lirst of- the- sixty-four to bo
recovered. Seven or eight, including
Overman ' D. Walker and Robert Steele,
will not be recovered until ; the forty feet
of water in the bottom of No. 6 ia pumped
out. Walker had just. gone down in the
cage when the explosion' occurred, and
Steele had just signaled for the cage to
be drawn. up. The engineer ; at the. hoist
says he heard the bell ring once, the sig
nal to hoist a cage with coal, and : then
within a few seconds the -, explosion > oc
curred. Steele would have: been right at
the cage.. The other five or six in : the
lowel level were Chinese. Â¦ - Some i believe
that the signal given may have been the

believed to have been about to "come up

The Call correspondent accompanied the
working party down No. 5 to-night and
went with it to the face where the fire
damp Is encountered. More than a thou
sand yards was traveled until the single
passage was reached, where, to make a
midwall giving a vent to tnc level, the
boards are being nailed up to extend the
brattices. Wooden mallets ate. used as
an extra precaution, in the fear that a
metai hammer might cause a spark, the
contact of which with gas would cause
another explosion. The work Is Blow, for
many stoppages have to be made to pre
vent leakages of the air current.
CUMBERLAND. B. C. Feb. IS.â The
work of the volunteers in No.' 5 mine has
been carried on bo successfully that now
the miners are in about 400 yards and
within seventy yards of where they ex
pect to find the first body out of the sixty
four who perished in the mine disaster
of last Friday. The work is' necessarily
slow, for It Is a constant light to force
the firedamp and gas back and carry the
air along by extending the brattices with
which they are making a midwall. Along
one side of this partition the air Is forced,
and, after being driven against the face
of the firedamp, it returns toward the
miners and back to the shaft.

It will go to the Governor to-morrow and

might be made against it, but when the
opposition began to talk they joined in

speech, in which he said that should Gov
ernor Gage come before the people at the
next election he would need no other plat
form to stand on than the fact that he
had caused the passage of the bill under
consideration. The vote was 25 to 9, as
follows:

Smith of Kern tried to have another

was lost. Smith said he would vote for
the bill because he believed there was
contagious disease in the State. He had
consulted his constituents and ascertained
that they would approve such a vote.
â¢Ashe opposed the measure, saying, as
he did so, that to pa?s the bill was to dig
the political grave of the Governor and
the. Republican party,Â«a. declaration which

Those who opposed the measure were
Rowell. Sims. Ashe, Belshaw and Taylor.
Belshaw tried to amend by striking out a
few words that, to him, seemed- to give
the State power to establish a separate
quarantine service. Ills amendment was

GAGE'S HUNDRED-THOUSAND-DOLLAR
HEALTH BILL PASSES THE SENATE
Chairman Broughton of the Corpora
tions Committee was absent from the As
sembly chamber, being confined to his
room by an attack of the mumps. Alden
Anderson was not present at the commit
tee meeting when the telephone bill was
considered, and Schleslnirer enters the
same plea. No member of the Corpora
tions Committee was present this morn
ing who cculd explain the meaning of the
amendments.
"Colonel" Brady insists that he had no
hand In the framing of the amendments:
that they were reported by the Committee
on Corporations without his knowledge,
and that he was dumfoundVd this morn
ing when they were read. It is certainly
true that he was speechless, and that th--Â»
Assemblymen who usually make hi6
speeches for him were suspiciously reluct
ant to have a say in the matter.
2 per cent of the gross receipts was strick
en out by the amendment, and a clause
inserted providing for the payment to the
State annually of a lifmp sum of $5000, "ui
lieu of all State, countv and municipal
franchise or license taxes. ' Section 5,
providing for the forfeiture -of certificates
of authority to do business in case of fail
ure to file affidavits setting forth that
the amount paid into the State treasurv
is 2 per cent of the gross receipts, was
also to be stficlcen out.
These amendments were promptly de
feated, the Assembly being in no temper
to further the career of cinch legislation
by the insertion of amendments that
would leave the bill mainly meaningless
and for the rest vicious. The bill goes to
third reading In its original form.
The second amendment to which objec
tion was made was still more obviously
drawn in the Interests of the telephone
companies. The provision relating to the
The original bill provided that a tele
phone company doing business other than
Interstate must procure a certicate of au
thority from the Secretary of State; must
maintain its principal office within the
State, and keep proper books of account
open to the inspection, of the Controller
or Secretary of State, and must pay to
the State lor the privileges it enjoys a
sum equal to 2 per cent of its gross re
ceipts.
The first objectionable amendment was
one' striking out the portion of section 2
by which the keeping of books to be In
spected by the Controller or Secretary of
State is made mandatory. It was passed
without Brady rising to the emergency
by any attempt to save an essential fea
ture of his bill. I>ater a motion by Melick
to reconsider the amendment was de
feated.

a willingness and regularity that augurs

come amendments to the new bills just
previously adopted. Then the Code Com
mission would be continued for two years
more to classify these amendments and
to revise the codes once more after their
introduction. By the next session of the
Legislature the new codes could be in full
force and if any amendments would then
be necessary a very few bills would be
sufficient to make ?hem.
The other plan is to force the consider
ation of the code bills to the exclusion of
other important legislation and then to
remain a few days over time on such
matters as the gentral appropriation bid
and reapportionment. Few outside tho
lawyers of the -Legislature would stay
overtime on the code bills without a pe'r
â¢iicm. but there are few who would not
stay to see their counties put into good
Republican districts by a favorable bill
on apportionment, or their State institu
tions properly supplied with funds. A
quorum might not na:ig over for code re
vision, but it would for apportionment o v
the general appropriation bill and so tho
plan is to leave for the last the two bills
more likely to hold the members.
There are now three revised codes be
fore the Legislatureâ the Code of Civil
Procedure, the Civil Code and the Penal
Code, the latter of trhich went in to-day.
The first plan, or a modification of it.
probably will be adopted as soon as the

OAKLAND RACETRACK - Monday,
Feb. 18, 1901.â Weather rainy. Track
A STEADY downpour of rain, a
heavy, sloppt track and a favorite
debauch were what .& fair
crowd got for entrance money .at
Tanforan yesterday. For the first
time in some clays the' Jockeys came out
In dun-colored breeches and the way the
mud caked every part of their bodies put
a premium on shower baths.
One favorite after another was under
mined and left to straggle in through the
mud.. All sorts of good prices were post
ed on the boards and the lucky pickersâ
who were fewâ harvested what the wet
brought.
The fourth race, a three-cornered spe
cial between Kenilworth, Articulate am?
Rolling Boer, over five furlongs, was the
attraction on the card. Burns piloted
Kenilworth, O'Connor 'Articulate* and
Henry was astride the Boer: As it hap
pened, Kenilworth took the money and
for a time silenced all the blatant talk
about Â»Vrticulatc's great mud-going pro
pensities. The best price on Â¦ Lopez's
horse was 6 to 5, Kenilworth Belling at 8
to 5 and the Boer at 4 to 1. Burns got
away I at the start and held his lead
throughout the race. Into the stretch the
three fie*tfooted horses splashed. In the
same order as they appeared on the slates
â Kepllworth, Articulate and the Boer.
Then the race really began, Burns driving
hard and O'Connor working: his horse for
all he was worth, but Kenilworth's lead
was too great to be overcome. I Articulate
cut down the separating distance foot by
foot and probably would "have won out,
had It been a seven-eighths race. Kenil
worth passed .under the wire a length
ahead 6f 'Articulate.
Matt Hogan, with See up, made tho
High Hoe and Nellie Forest look like sell
ing platers'. In the first race of the day
over six furlongs. Matt Hogan was by
no means a favorite, yet he grappled the
first money.
Then came Phoenician, 10 to 1, who cap
.tured the purse, and Pupil and Theory,
second and third, both far from the odds
on favorite in the betting. * Again tho
bookies showed th<vbroad grin.
Cunard. 2 to 1, with O'Connor in the sad
dle, beat out Sol Lichtenstein and Sister
Jeanie in the four furlong Nursery
stakes. The Sister and Sol had a close
race for the place, but Sol won that po
sition.
.Royal Prize, 12 to 1, beat the field In
the seven furlong3 for 4-year-olds and up
The Singer was favorite," but was not in
voice, coming nowhere within the money
Oscar Tolle captured the one-mile sell
ing race for 3-year-olds, . the last on the
card. Haralamb got the place.
Twelve . regular books and two "held
fcooks cut in yesterday, at Tanforan, but
the betting was not as heavy as durine
the past week.-" .

pleasant few hours In the saddle, finish

warded'her backers by finishing *abso-*

Thirteen platers started in the opening
scramble and all kinds of tips were float
intr about. >Abput, the time it, looked as if
old Mainstay might deliver the merchan
dise, Stuart came along on Spike, backed
down at post time to 13 to 5 favoritism,
winning very handily. There was a
Heallii-^play-dn NewKgatherer, which ap
peared-before the footlights for the first
time this season, but he was apparently
attacked with stage fright, finishing bade
in the mud. .
The two-year-olds gave Starter Holt
man considerable trouble at the post; Es
tado, a well played one with Nash. Turner
up, repeatedly refusing to break. When
sent away, Howell rode a nicely judged
race on Dr. Scharff, the 2 to 1, favorite,
reaching the wire three lengths ahead of
Pepper riauce. If F. Kelly, on Maraschino,
had not drawn his whip that colt would
have been second. .With his head turned
loose the' youngster bore out, losing: the
place by ,a' nose only. Fred Atterbury.
showed a world of speed in false break
aways, running his .race at the post.
.With but two pounds . difference in
weights *'K1 Mido looked to hold Sunello
safe, and the big horse did dispose of Mat
Storn's colt with little difficulty. An even
money favorite, â¢ he led from the start.
Sunello trailed in his wake the entire
route, downing Rio Shannon In a drive for
thet place. .
v Fred Foster's mare Lennep was fairly
in her element In the .sloppy .footing, and
the six. furlong sprint fifth to be decided
was just a gallop for her. Mounce held
tho crack "muddcr" under restraint to
the stretch, where he let go the wraps and
she rah over Sad Sam and Frank Bell.
Sam grew very weary, losing the place by
four open lengths. Nash Turner was un
able to do anything with Gibraltar, the
big fellow i finishing lengths behind h's
company.
Hagerdon, from the stable of Don Cam
eron, was touted as the real thing for tho
after-piece, at one of the shorter sprint
ing distances, and Alice Dougherty
showed him a clean pair of heels from tho
kick-off. Eight to five was about the best
obtainable .about Hagerdon at post time
and ho fell short three lengths at the wire.
The Buffoon, a 10 to 1 shot, ran into the
show.

Supervisors of San Mateo Will Not
Extend Tanforan Season â Action
on Ingleside Reopening Deferred
visor Dwyer asked Mr. Tobin if It would
not be better to wait until the belated
members of the board arrived, but tha
suggestion was not accepted.
THE Supervisors have israln deferred
action on the bill to reopen Ingte*
side racetrack. When, the m iaer
came before the Board yesterday
Supervisor Joseph P. Tobin, chair
man of the Police Coznxolttee, which re
ported favorably on the bill, renupsted
tho matter be continued" one week, as
he desired a full board discussion and
vote.
While this act!on was disappointing to
tho^e who were opposed to the bill, they
hafl to abide by the action of the Super
visors. Prince Poniatowski and C&artej
L. Fair attended the meeting, and wera
reinforced by a petition alleged to hava
been signed by tne business men of Sari
t rar.ciscu favoring the reopening of th*
track. When they saw their pet schema
blocked fur a time they showed their
chagrin. Hoth men had been confident
that they would leave the chambers with
.victory Â»n their Rrasp, bu: this unfore
seen setback created consternation in the
ranks of their followers.
Nearly a score of the foremost preach
ers of the city attended the session to
show by their presence that they were
not in sympathy with any ordinance that
would permit licensed gambling in this
city and county. Some of the preachers
were ready to make a last appeal to
the board not to forsake their obligations
to the better element by opening the
nefarious racetrack. They had no oppor
tunity, as the matter was postponed.
They intend, however, to return on Mon
day next and protest if necessary against
the passage of a bill of that character.
Among the clergymen present were Rev.
F. A. Doane, Rev. Dr. Kovard. Itev H
H. Bell. Rev. J. N. Beard. Rev. >' Kl
Baker, Rev. "William M. Woodward. Rev.
E. A. Woods and Rev. Phillip Coomhe.
When reports of committees were
called for the clerk read tha bill favor'.nsr
the reopening of the track. Every one
became interested and awaited develop
ments. Supervisor Tobln leisurely aros*
and moved that action on the bill be de
ferred until tho following week, as a
number of members were absent. Super-

Stafford (=cratch>. The game between
Hoffman (45> and Abadie C40) was the best
of the evening-. Hoffman outplayed tho
clever sprinter and had him moving all
around the court. Score, 43 to 3.

one game are dropped from, the tourna
ment.
Powers and Green opened the tourna
ment, the former winning by a score of
51 to 37. Tho game was full of fine plays.
Green showed himself to be well up in
thÂ« game, but needed practice. The lively
ball kept both men moving and when thÂ«Â»
contest ended they were completely fag
ged out. Powers' left hand serve was too
much for (Jrrpn and he succumbed.

The project of an extended season of
racing in this county la now a thing; of
the. past.
REDWOOD CITY, Feb. 18â Racing
in San Mateo County will not be
extended and the vicious gam
bling element Is not to have full
sway in this pretty suburb of
San Francisco.
By the unanimous action of the BoarJ
of Supervisors to-day a rebuke was arl
miniatered Prince Poniatowski, Senator
Byrnes, Charles L. Fair and others wfto
sought to have tho racing limit in this
county extended.
When the Supervisors recently limited
the racing season to thirty-five fla >' 3 thilr
owners ot Tanforan racetrack and their
friends circulated a petition for signaturo.-<
aaking the Supervisors to repeal the ordi
nance. The track owners claimed rro
fluently that they had secured more man
2000 signatures to the petition.
The Supervisors met to-day in regular
session and when the petition was pre
sented, it was found to contain only ow
names. Before the board met Prince
Poniatowski and his allies indulged ra
considerable '"log rolling" and all kmua
of arguments were brought to bear in tlie
hope of inducing the Supervisors to rÂ»~
consider their action in limiting the racing
season. , ,
The owners of Tanforan racetrack ana
their friends met with a signal defeat,
however. â¢ â¢ Â¦
When the petition was presented to the
Supervisors th? chairman asked what dis
position should be made of it. Supervisor
Elkrenlfotter. who had voted against tno
ordinance to Itmltf the racinpr season,
moved thaf'the Detftion-be received and
placed on ftfe. : .
The entire Board, of Supervisors voted
in the affirmative, and under the rules of
the board thl3 action definitely disposes of
the petition. â¢
Under the present ordinance limiting the
racing season Tanforan racetrack has but
twenty-four more, days, including to-day,
in which racinsr can be carried on until
February 5, 19Â»2.
It was expected that an ordinance would
be presented to-day to repeal the one now
in effect, but no one of the three Super
visors who voted for the original ordin
ance could be Induced to stultify himself
by reversing his previous attitude on the
question..

MISS JACKSON'S HEARERS
CHLAHMED BY HER PLAYING
She Has Beautifully Toned Violin
and Handles It With Ex
quisite Freedom.
A delightful afternoon was spent yester-
day by those fortunate enough to hear
the brilliant young girl violinist. Miss
Leonora Jackson, at the California The
ater. Miss Jackson more than fulfills all
the expectations aroused by the favorable,
reports of her genius, which have reached
here from time to time.
Miss Jackson has a beautifully toned
violin., and handles the instrument with
exquisite freedom. Her tone is broad and
fine, her technique masterly and her ren
derings marked by an astonishing ma
turity of conception, though she has very
evidently not yet reached the limit of her
possibilities In this or any other direction.
She has the beautiful bow arm of all the
Joachim students, and It as free from
mannerisms as the master himself. The
young violinist was received with marked

ty. The offer, which is in elaborately print
ed book form,' was submitted by Russell

half of the lot at Fourth and Clara streets
to the trustees of the Free Public Library
for library purposes and the westerly half
to the Police Department for a police sta
tion was finally passed." . .
Stafford opposed 'the establishment of
another police station at the corner of
Fourth and Clara streets. He held that
there were enough police stations in ex
istence at present without going to addi
tional expenditures for the purpose. Reed,
held. that the ordinance was merely an
attempt to fix the next tax budget before
; the .proper time. ,Dwyer made a plea for
the ordinance, as It was merely a transfer
of property and would result in the estab
lishment of.a library .south of Market

Is pitched In the same key, and It is the
leit-motif of Bernhart, her ruling impulse.
| that for which her name stands and the
domain In which Ehe Is undoubtedly the
greatest of all living actresses.
"La Tosca" is not a pretty play. It Is
melodramatic jn a degree to satisfy the
humblest frequenter of Morosco's in Its 10
cent day?, but offers superb opportunity
to the Interpreter of the name role. La
Tosca is a prlma donna attached to the
Italian court, petted, spoiled and wor
shiped and In 'ove with an artist. Count
Mario, who through affording shelter to
a "republican. ' Angelottl, has laid him
self open to the charge of treason.
Scarpia. chief of police of the Roman
Government, is also in love with L*
Tosca, and contrives to arouse her Jea:
nusy of Mario with intent to discover
both the hiding place of the artist and
of Angelottl. He succeeds In his purpose
and too late La Tosc-a discovers his per
fidy. A splendid scene occurs where the
discovered lovers are trying to conceal
the whereabouts of Angelotti. who has
hidden himself In an old well, and Scarpia,
while causing Mario to be tortured in an
outside room, compels La Tosca to wit
ness his ageny. tempting her to confess
the refugee's hiding jlace with a promise
of her lover's safety. Then occurs a mar

love for her lover and faith to the un
fortunate republican, but her love con

from his tortures only to see his frlenJ
brought in dead from the hiding place
where he had kille 1 himself rather than
he taken alive. This netâ the thirdâ closes
with Mario reproaching La Tosca with
his friond's death.
The fourth scene, the strongest of the
play, is laid in the private room of S**ar

for her lover's life. Scarpia promises to
grant her request on one condition â that

It was a graceful and a generous act
on the part of Mr. Wheelan last night,

for himself and gave so large a portion
to Ferris Hartman. To the audience that
would not be denied the speech It so
loudly called for. Mr. Wheelan expresso-1
his thanks for the genuinely Callfornlan
welcome was accorded him mfter an
absence so short, and then said that to
Mr. Hartman was due all the praise for
the excellent manner in which "The

the stage. Then the audience, applauded
louder and more persistently than ever
until Ferris came out and embraced h's

set and there was neither hitch nor mls.<
key to mar the excellent performance.
There was not a vacant seat in the house

Everybody was living easy In the offlca

to the munificence of William Riley, one
of the blue-coated mercuries... Riley- vlÂ«-
Ited the races at Tanforan yesterday and
mands their homage. And this Is ac
corded him. His rendition of "The Ro
mance," from "Les Huguenots." and the
aria from "Aida" are not less pleasing,
but "The Palms" Is, for the Inspiration It
offers, foremost. The Dumonds, "French
street musicians." are offered the full
support of the audience. Dorothy Stude
baker (Mrs. Scott McKeown) pleased her
audience, which was generous In Its ap
plause. The Kelcey Sisters, among the
new faces presented, are the originators
of a bright sketch. George Austin Moore,
the character vocalist: Al and' Mamie An
derson, colored vaudeville performers, and
Johnnie Johns, monologise, complete an
excellent bill.
Alcazar.
"What Happened to - Jones" drew a
large audience to the A'.cazar Theater
last night notwithstanding the rain, anil
the^ clever and amusing farce went with a
snap. The major part of the audience wes
convulsed with laughter almost from,start
to finish. All the parts were most cVedir
ably filled. Joseph Kilgour as Jonc3
proved that he ranks high as a comedian.
His portrayal of the character will com
pare favorably with that of Harry Cor
pon Clarke, who has made it a specialty.
George Webster was inimitable as Pro
fessor Goodly. He nlaved the part with
consistency and did not miss .a point.
Howard Scott as the Bishop and Kdwln T.
Emery "as Richard were excellent. -Miss
J,!la Convere was bright and charming as
Cissy, and Miss Ida Banning In her old
part of Alvina was as amuslne as ever.
Miss Ada Lewis made a decided hit as
Helma. the Swedish servant. The other
characters were ably sustained.

The bill prescribing general rules and
standard specifications for street and side
walk work and limiting the use of various
kinds of pavements was finally passed by
the Board of Supervisors yesterday. Reed
objected to the passage of the bill, as it
excluded wooden pavements' from the
schedule. He argued that such pavements
would minimize the slipping' of horses
thereon.
"We should not exclude a recognized
pavement which has stood the test in Eu
rope and Eastern cities," said Reed.' "We
have been subjected to a bituminous rock
ring for years and the exclusion of wood
en pavements will strengthen that ring."
Commissioner Manson stated that the
Board" of Works did not feel justified in
recommending wooden pavements, but
would do so after a more thoroueh In
vestigation had been made. Wooden pave
ments, he said, were successful only In
places where there was constant rainfall
and consequent moisture.
The ordinance prohibiting the manufac
ture and sale of any baneful or deleteri
ous food adulterant was finally passed. .
The ordinance authorizing the repavlng
of Pine street, from Sansome to Battery
with asphalt, at a cost of $2575, was finally
passed. i
The ordinance submitted by the Mer
chants' Association and designed to per
mit of the construction of advertising
signs of various classes, including elec
tric and. other signs, was deferred, one
week. Reed said that the City Attorney
had advised the board that it had no pow
er to grant permits for permanent en
croachments under the charter provisions.
He moved the bill's reference to the City
Attorney, but the motion was lost.
The City Engineer was directed to ar
range a conference with the Harbor Com
mission In order to flx a permanent monu
ment as an official base to which refer
ence may be given for the establishment
of grades In this city and county.
The ordinance regulating the use of pub
lic streets for the purpose of placing
therein pipes and other conduits in sup
plying water, gas and electricity for light
ing purposes was passed to print.
The stationery clerk was authorized to
provide the Justices of the Peace. District
Attorney and Superior Judges with cer
tain law books. .
The bill requiring indemnity bonds from
owners of advertising fences was deferred
one week. Brandensteln explained that
the bill was illegal and he would present
a substitute In its stead.
The amended . ordinance granting the
Bay and Coast Railway Company a fran
chise to enter the* city at Twenty-fourth
and Illinois streets, with, certain condi
tions imposed thereon, was rereferred to
the Street Committee to give President
Kimball of the Federation of Mission Im

An ordinance making it a misdemeanor
to defraud a hack driver was referred to
the Judiciary Committee. The ordinance

BOAED OF .WORKS IS
Â¦X' REDUCING EXPENSES
In Order to Keep Within A.ppropria-
tion Number of Laborers Tem
porarily Suspended. , -
In order to keep within Its appropriation
and continue to supply places for high
salaried employes the Board of Public
Works yesterday decided that it could dis
pense with a large number of laborers
and effect a saving of nearly 13000 a
month. - t
Consequently ten laborers, three pavers,
three rammers, two bricklayers and two
helpers, four underground workers, five
teams and four carts were laid off. The
men were informed that it was necessary
to save at least $100 per day, and were as
sured that their suspension was only tem
porary. The laid off men, however, think
differently.
Proper certification was made to the
Civil Service Commission as to the reason
for the lay-on*.
"The downtown streets have never been
in better condition than they are to-day,"
said Commissioner Magulre. "We have to
keep within the appropriation, and that i.s
all there Is to it. The men are only laid
off temporarily, and may be employed
again during the fiscal year."

pany to a board of control, whose presi
dent represented Indian affairs in the
House of Commons. The charter was re
newed from time to time and each re
newal was marked by further develop
ments of territorial authority. The out
come of a succession of wars involved the
direct annexation or the indirect sub
ordination of native states under the form
of protectorates, iln 185S, after the ter
rible mutiny, the. policy embodied in
Pitt's "India bill" was carried out to its
conclusion. The board of control was
(superseded bv the Secretary of State and
the' Council for India, and all the politi
cal rights of the company were trans
ferred to the crown. Finally, in Ian, at
Delhiâ the old Imperial cityâ the Queen of
Great Britain and Ireland was proclaimed
"Empress of India"â "Kaisar-i-Hind.
Thus all India became the inalienable
heritage of the British monarchy.
How India Is Governed.
The Secretary of State for India is the
representative of her Majesty's Govern
ment. He has absolute control of all for
eign policy affecting India. He also con
trols the expenditure of the Indian reve
nues and in all matters he can impose his
orders upon the Indian Government. All
the higher government appointments-re
quire his approval.
He is assisted by a council, consisting of
ten members, nine of whom must have
served in India for the ten years im
mediately preceding their appointment.
Thev hold office for ten years and must
not "be members of either house of the
British Parliament. Subject to the con
trol of the Secretary of State, the su
preme executive authority in India is the
Governor General in Council âin which
name all acts of the Government of India
run. He is appointed directly by the sov
ereign and holds office for five years. The
Governor General, or "Viceroy" as he Is
commonly called, has the power of veto
in all matters, whether executive or legis
lative. He unites in his person the at
tributes of a constitutional monarch and
the powers of a Prime Minister. The
Governor General Is assisted by the
Executive Council of five members, with
the addition of the commander in chief
of the forces in India. The Governors of
provinces are ex offlcio; members of the
council whenever it meets within their
several administrations. All these high
officials.must.be of British nationality.
The council is really 'a sort of cabinet of
the Viceroy. The matters principally
dealt with are: (1) Affairs connected with
foreign policy; (2) direct, administration;
(3) authorization of business to be trans
acted by the legislative, council.
The legislative council consists of ten to
twenty members â official and non-official.-
British and natives are alike eligible. Its
functions are generally the making of
laws and regulations, . the supreme direc
tion of revenue and expenditures and leg
islation In general. Its acts are published
in -the -Gazette, of -India.;- Â» Â¦ .
The "Central Bureau, so called, Is the
secretariat of the i supreme Government
of India. - The . seven . secretaries are re
spectively: House/ Foreign. Revenue and
Agriculture, Trade ; and Commerce,* Mili
tary Affairs; Public Works and the Legist
latlve Council. -From it issue orders to
regulate v' administration *.and to it are
made reports from the provinces. V
Government of the Provinces.
British ; India is divided "into ' thirteen
provinces or;! administrations: Madras
and > Bombay,' whose â¢ Governors - are ap
pointed ? by the J Secretary of State;
gal, northwest, with Oudh; . the Punjab
and Burma, which have Lieutenant I Gov
ernors appointed by the '-'Governor-Gene
ral , in Council" ; Assam, Coorg, Beluchi
stan. Berar,:Ajmere, Merwara. the Central
province ; ; and s the "Andaman , Islands ' are
under Chief Commissioners appointed by
the' "Governor, General in Council." :
All these ; f nnctionarles . have provincial
councils 7 '" constituted Mike .the â¢ supreme
council. . 1 They.: enjoy, a considerable
amount of administrative . and financial
without distinction of any kind. All
Deputy Magistrates and Assistant Col
lectors are natives.
The unit of administration throughout
British India is the district, at the head
of which is an executive officer who is
styled collector magistrate or deputy
commissioner. Upon the ability and en
ergy of this official depends ultimately
the efficiency of British rule In India. His
functions are twofold: (1) To collect rev
enue; (2) to act as Judge in civil and
criminal suits, both of first instance and
appeal. The collector magistrate is a
sort ofhome secretary in miniature. His
aim is to set forth the benefits of paternal
and conciliatory government. Under his
immediate orders are education, dispen
saries, police, jails, sanitation, local tax
ation, etc. Every phase of the complex
racial and religious life of the native
comes before him and disputes of everjÂ»
kind are submitted to his decision. He
is, in short (or long), lawyer, accountant,
surveyor, engineer, agriculturist, political
economist and compiler of state papers.
The work, moreover, of his subordinates,
whether British or native, depends upon
the stimulus of his personal emaxple.
Belations of British and Natives*.
There are in India (50 native states â
trreat and small. They are governed by
their own- princes and chiefs with the ad
vice and help of British residents, repre
senting the supreme Government of India.
Some of these rulers administer the In
ternal affairs of their respective states
with almost complete independence. Their
authority, however,- is limited by their
Individual treaties and engagements. The
suzerain power does not allow them to go
to war with one another nor to form al
liances with foreign powers, and It Inter
venes in cases of bad government or op
pression, exercising a general control in
the direction of peace and contentment.
These feudatory rulers possess revenues
and armies. The gross Income of the
princes of India' is Â£15.000,000 ($75,000,000),
the sum of their tribute is Â£600,000 ($3,000!
er annum, and they maintain In all
80,000 native troops in addition to those
they furnish for the Imperial service.
The relations between British and na
tives are perfectly amicable, so long as
there is. no Interference with the native
religious observances or with the native
women. All are equal before the law. A
native can earn exactly the same wage
as a British workman. Under British
rule iife^ and property are alike safe.
Taxes and dues are the same for all. But
Inasmuch as . Europeans have a far
greater capacity for work than the na
tives and are able to do more work in a
snorter time, a consciousness of superior
ity sometimes produces arrogance, which
is a fruitful source of racial disputes.
Justice is administered by the \ high
courts of the various provinces, and is
based upon:' (1) The enactments* of the
legislative councils; (2) the statutes of the
mVu h xÂ£ a !i Uamen V a PPHcable to India;
(31 the HInduand â¢ Mohammedan laws of
inneritance and domestic economy: (4)
the jlaws -of caste and race. There is an
Indian penal, code.

THE RISING TIDE.
ONE of the good results of unlimited debate in
the Senate is that the hours occupied by some
members in making speeches to which no one
listens afford other members an opportunity to thor
oughly digest the mass of legislation before them and
to discover what the total amounts to. An illustra
tion of the benefits thus derived is to be seen in the
present attitude of the Senate toward the various ap
propriation bills. Measures that passed the House
without much attention being paid to them have
been held up in the Senate long enough for the eco
nomists of that body to determine what would be the
I result of adopting them.
The Washington Post recently reported a discus-
I sion in the Senate brought about by an inquiry of
i Senator Morgan concerning the total amounts of the
! appropriations of the session up to that time. The re
! port says:
j At first, replying Indefinitely that the amount would
I be from S30.000.000 to $10,000,000 more than last year. Ben
i ator Allison was pressed for a more specific answer.
I "The general appropriations will, I think," he said,
i "reach i75Q.000.000 this year."
"I should say." interrupted Mr. Hale, "that they will
be nearer $800,000,000 than $700,000,000.' â¢
Senator Allison agreed that when appropriations of
every character were considered the total would reach
from $769,000,000 to $780,000,000. "I think they will be fully
as high as that," commented Mr. Hale.
"I have no doubt they will be $760,000,000," repeated
Mr. Allison.
"We have not found any place where we could cut
off anything," said llr. Hale. "The tide, immensely
swollen heretofore, Is more swollen and turbid."
"And Btill rising," added Senator Spooner.
"And etlil rising," echoed Mr. Hale.
"And rapidly rising." suggested Mr. Allison.
I "And rapidly rising," repeated Mr. Hale. "And," he
! added, "the country knows nothing about it. We wero
I shocked at the idea of the billion-dollar Congress, and
I before we know it* we will have a billion-dollar session."
A short time before that colloquy took place.Senator
Gallinger had introduced a resolution calling for the
appointment of a joint committee of both houses for
the purpose of making careful inquiry and investiga-,
tion inta special pension legislation. In closing his
three minute speech on the resolution Senator Gal
linger said:. "What I want to emphasize is that in
my judgment the. 3000 and more bills that will come
to the Committee on Pensions of the Senate in the
present Congress will be doubled in the next Con
gress and probably trebled in the Congress that will
succeed the next unless something is done to check
the evil. There is a movement on foot all over the
country to flood Congress with requests for pension
legislation, and the soldiers are being led to believe
that it is not only a proper thing to do, but that it is
the easy way for. them to get their pensions all-owed
and increased, ; .â¢;
Congress has, in fact, been voting money in the
dark. Representatives of all parties and of all States
have been equally blamable in the matter. For
I great measures such as the promotion of irrigation in
tlie arid States and the upbuilding of the American
merchant marine it has been found impossible to get
money; but for small matters, like the improvement
of Buncombe Creek, cr the granting of ill-conside-ed
pensions, appropriations have been prompt. Thus
while there has been no very large appropriation car
ried in any. one bill the aggregate; runs up close on
to the billion dollar mark for a single session.
The United States, is a vast country and its people
are rich. The affairs of such a nation cannot be car
ried on successfully by any, . cheese-paring policy.
There must be large expenditures for large measures.
The people would not object to a billion dollar ses
jsion if the money were wisely expended, but to -have
CHINflMEN IN LONDON.
WHILE Count von Waldersee at the head of the
armies of allied Christendom is invading China
with drums and gfcns and all the pomp and
circumstance of glorious war the Chinese are quietly
invading Europe in the humble guise of workingmen
and without any parade at all. Already they have ap
peared in London -in sufficient numbers to create a
good deal of discussion in the press. Quite a colony
of them have been brought to that city to wck in
laundries, and fears are being expressed as to the out
come.
The London Chronicle in reviewing the problem
recently said: "A Chinese native can live so cheaply,
by reason of the quality and quantity* of food he re
quires, that he can afford to undersell the white
worker, and without doubt he will do it. That is,
after all, but human nature the world over. Since hÂ»
is an excellent laundrynian, punctual, and never loses
articles intrusted to him, it is. obvious that the Celes
tial will thrive. Every fresh batch of coolies which
the English promoters of- the Chinese laundry import
will, on the expiration of contract, pass on into the
market in the same manner, a process which logically
must end in one way, unless, of course, there is some
external - intervention."
It is only in late years that the Chinese working
classes have found their way to Europe, but, having
found it, a great many of them may be expected to
seek to profit by it. It has already been noted that
thousands of Chinese have engaged as laborers on the
Siberian railroad. It is inevitable that when that road
is completed many of them will find it a means of
entering European Russia, aod thence to West
ern Europe will be an easy step for the workers. Thus
Europe will be exposed to the Chinese invasion on
both sides, and the yellow immigrants will pour in
through the free ports of Great by way cf
the sea and through Russia by way of the Siberian
railway.
It is worth noting in this connection that the China
men of London have already taught the courts of that
city the Chinese disrespect for an oath. Thus the
Westminster Gazette recently said: "The Chinese!
witness who was called at Marlborough-street
Police Court yesterday took the oath by breaking a
saucer, which seems to be the usual method - for
Celestials in courts in this country.- Yesterday's wit
ness was presumably more particular than a China
man who once appeared 5 to give evidence at Bow
street. He was politely consulted as to the method
in which he would prefer to be sworn. 'Oh/ said he,
with a fine eclecticism, 'kill 'im cock, break 'im plate,
smell. 'im book, all samey!' " . ,
The Von Waldersee invasion with its cannons and
its military glories will make more noise than the
silent advance of the Chinese invasion, but in the end
the victory "may be with' the silent marchers. The
spoliation of China has been utterly unjust from any
and every point of view, and if the spoliation be car
ried too far it may rcsultin a famine in China that
will force the people of that. country to spread abroad
over Asia and Europe, and then the. white nations
will have reason to regret that they ever disturbed the
repose of the old kingdom.
The talk of an extra session of Congress has hurried
up the talk about the choice of a Speaker for the next
House of Representatives, but while several candi
dates for the position have been named there seems no
reason why Henderson should not begin preparing,
for an encore.

MATRONS FOR JAILS.
BILLS have been introduced into the Legislature
by Senator Taylor and by Assemblyman Mc-
Wade providing for the appointment of a
matron in city and town jails where no such official
now exists. These measures are in the interests of
morality, decency and humanity, and merit the sup
port of the Legislature and the approval of the.Gov
ernor.
In one respect the bills differ. That of Senator
Taylor leaves the appointment of a matron optional
with the local authorities. It declares: "In all cases
where the appointment of matrons for city and town
jails and prisons is not now provided for by the law
the legislative board cr body of any city or town in
this State is hereby given jurisdiction and power to
appoint, * * * to fix her bond and compensation
and to specify the duties of such matron, whose du
ties shall relate especially to all necessary searching
of female prisoners and to their health, welfare and
reformation, the tenure of such matron to be at the
pleasure of such legislative board or body."
Assembly bill No. 723, introduced by Mr. Mc-
Wade, makes the appointment of a matron compul
sory by declaring: "In all cases where the office of
ir.atron of the jail or prison in and for any city and
town in this State is not now provided for by law the
office of matron of the jail or prison in and for such
city or town is hereby created." Section 2 of the bill
provides: "The legislative board or body of each
city or town referred to in section I of this act is
hereby authorized, empowered and directed to appoint
tnd provide for the compensation of a matron of the
jail or prison in and for the city and town of whuch
si:ch board or body is the governing board or body,
and to specify the conditions and fix the amount of
the matron's official bond to be approved by such
board or body."
Of the two bills that which leaves the appointment
optional with the local authorities is to be preferred.
In the first place it is always well to preserve local
stlf-government as far as possible, and in the second
place there are doubtless some towns in the State
where female prisoners are almost unknown and
where a matron is not a necessary official.
That question aside, both bills are excellent A
woman under arrest as a suspect or condemned to
imprisonment is entitled to the ministrations of an
official of her own sex. Mr. McWade's bill provides
that the matron "shall have free access at all rea
sonable times to the immediate presence of all fe
ir.ale prisoners, including the right of personal visi
tation and conversation with them, and in all cases
cf searching the person of female prisoners the
matron exclusively shall make such search; and the
matron shall, by example, advice, and admonition,
employ her best abilities to secure and promote the
health, welfare and reformation of all such prisone-s."
Every self-respecting man and woman will recog
nize the importance of such an official in our jails
sr.d prisons. It is, in fact, something of a disgrace
that in any important jail of the State no such offi
cial exists. It is to b; hoped, therefore, the measure
will be promptly enacted.

CATTLE-GROWERS' CONVENTION.
rROM the convention of the Cattle-growers' As
sociation, which is to meet at Denver March 5.
much in the way of good not for the cattlemen
only but for the whole people of the country is to be
expected. The association was organized at Salt Lake
City last January because recent developments in the
cattle industry prove the imperative need of it. From
that industry the people draw one of their most im
portant food supplies, and it concerns the welfare of
all to conserve it and promote it. ,
In an address delivered at the meeting when the
association was organized Colonel John P. Irish said:
"I anticipate that as a result of this organization we
will not read in statistics in the future of a decline in
the number of head of cattle in' this country; we will
in the future see a rise in the cattle statistics; we .will
see an increase in the herd, and we will see above all
an advance in the breeding of cattle. We will have
not only more cattle, but we will have better cattle;
we will have better beef, and we will have more and
better people to eat the beef." .""- .
As an illustration of how necessary it is that some
effective system of promoting and protecting the .in
dustry be adopted Mr. J. S. Van Doran of New Mex
ico said: "I am from a section, of country where
twenty years ago a distance of 50 miles by 100 miles
sustained 50,000 head of cattle. To-day you can
not in that area count 800. It has been devastated by
improper handling of our grasses; the sheep have
been allowed to go over it and eat it to the roots. If
you remember the statistics in 1890, only a decade ago,
we had 589 head of cattle "to every 1000 inhabitants.
The recent census gives but 375 head of cattle to
every 1000 inhabitants. With our increased territories
and with the increased demand for foreign export
upon us what will be the result? It will be but a few
years â yes, even within the life of men of my age and
your age â that the poor man, the laborer and the
artisan will not be able to have beef on his table. It
will be a luxury."
It is to be noted, furthermore, that the organizers
aim to make the association a thoroughly representa
tive one. At the time of the organization Mr. A. C
Cleveland of Nevada said: "We want all the cattle
men; we don't want this a close combinationâ we
want all the cattlemen interested in the industry at
the convention."
In accord with that sentiment the call for the con
vention states: "The present idea is for individual
membership to form the basis of this association,
which will give a small cattle-grower as much voice
on the floor of the convention hall as a large owner,
but that will be finally settled at the first convention.
The only qualification for membership is to be a
cattle grower and owner." The call goes on to add:
"This association is to protect and advance the inter
ests of all cattle-growers, large or small, equally, and
we want all on the membership roll. It is especially
desired that a large attendance be had at the coming
convention at Denver, and any cattle-grower who
can possibly come is urged to do so."
The cattle industries of California are large and
should have ample representation at the meeting. It
is to be hoped therefore that many of the leading men
engaged in the business will attend the convention
and actively aid in making the association as useful as
the promoters have designed it to be..
THE KflNSfiS LYNCHER.
AS .Mrs. Nation is raising up quite an army of
imitators, not only in Kansas but in other
States with a less gory pedigree, it is worth
while to look into her method and the assumption by
her of the right to do as she pleases in the case of per
sons whom she tries and convicts of disobedience to
the law.
Because the law of Kansas, based on the State con
stitution* forbids the ?ale of liquor for Other than me
chanical, sacramental or medicinal use, and because
liquor is sold in saloons for other uses, Mrs. Nation
claims the right to destroy such liquor and the prop
erty Wherein it is sold. This she does without process
of law, due or otherwise, and in doing it imperils the
public peace and brings in jeopardy the lives and
property of those who have no relation to the
disturbance.
Her course has no recognition in law and is as
harmful to public order as the saloon evil which she
pretends to suppress. Her denunciation of the courts
for not enforcing the anti-liquor law is without merit.
She has it in her power to put the courts t'o the test
by filing with proper officers information and com
plaints against the saloons. When prosecutions are
thereby lawfully originated the courts have jurisdic
tion and can close every saloon so proceeded against.
But that is the quiet and orderly way of the law. To
follow it introduces nothing spectacular, and brings
no notoriety. The law works quietly, and its greatest
achievements make less noise than one mob. Mrs.
Nation's method is exactly the same as that of a
mob. A mob is unlawful, but it justifies itself by say
ing that the wretch it lynches has violated the law.
That is Mrs. Nation's plea. She has no other. But
suppose a Kansas murderer is at large and she meets
and kills him. Is she guiltless?
Has she a commission to replace the courts and
juries of the country, and to indict, try, convict and
punish all whom she conceives to be guilty of law
breaking? Her conduct in the presence of the courts
of law before which she has been taken is that of de
fiant contempt for their dignity and their rights. Her
example is far more demoralizing than that of fifty
lawless saloons, for it tends to inculcate that spirit of
mob violence of which there is already too much in
the-country-
Her pretense that there is no other way to enforce
the anti-liquor law is obviously false. Why she chose
it is exposed by her notoriety and money-seeking tour
through Iowa to Chicago. When the money failed to
appear and her paid lectures were delivered to empty
seats she at once abandoned her tour and returned
to Kansas to lay up more notoriety in the hope to
coin it into money.
Were she even the fanatic she pretends to be, or
the devoted philanthropist and reformer she wants to
be thought, the number at her lectures and the re
ceipts would in no wise affect her, but she would go
en, content even if- only two or three were gathered
together to listen and learn the way of truth and right.
She is not of that stuff, however, but has specula
tion in her eyes and seeks notoriety for gain. It is to
be hoped that her misconduct before the court will get
her a'term in jail for contempt that will make her see
the need of respecting the law herself, as well as talk
ing so much about its violation by others.

CONSUIi O0ODN0W SPEAKS
ON ORIENTAL COMMERCE
He Advises the Merchants How to
Pack Perishable Goods for
Shipment.
John Goodnow. United States Consul
General at Shanghai, addressed a meeting
of citizens at the Chamber of Commerce
yesterday on "Our Oriental Trade and the
Present Situation In China." He spokÂ»
ip part as follows:
"There is no town or city in the United
States so interested in the trade of tho
Orient as San Francisco. It means every
thing to this city and to this* coast. How
to secure this trade and how to retain It
are questions which we must consider. I
think that it would be a good plan to es
tablish at Shanghai or some other point
of equal prominence In the Orient an ex
hibit of American merchandise, not as a
matter of immediate profit, but for the
advertisement which it would afford.
"There is one thing which the people of
this city must attend to. They must have
their perishable goods properly packed.
They have to go through several changes
of climate and are in great danger of be
ing spoiled. California produce, such as
butter and fruit, Is extremely scarce in
the Orient, and commands An exception
ally high price. Great quantities of goods
from this State are lost through defective
packing."

acquaintance and on some pretext took
him to the room. An old man was there
and they began to bet on the turn of a
card. Fuller was asked to bet $S0, and he.
put a $50 Confederate' bill between two $o
greenbacks and won. Before he could
take the money a man came in and seized
all the money and cards, claiming he was
an officer. Fuller was hustled out of the
room.
B'NAI B'RITH GRAND LODGE
DISCUSSES ENDOWMENT
Number of Changes in Laws Pro-
posed and Referred to ths Leg
islation Committee.
At the second session of tho Grand
Lodge of the Independent Order of B'nai
B'rlth yesterday the following proposi
tions were referred to the committee on
legislation:
To abolish the board of relief; to change
the day of opening the Grand Lodge from
Funday to Monday; to repeal the law requir
ing deposit of the funds In bank; to amend
tho law so as to permit past presidents, who
are not representatives to the Grand Lodge,
to hold the office of trustee; to amend the
law so that the ritualistic work at funerals
shall be superintended by a district deputy,
either In person or by some one specially ap
pointed for the purpose.
An amendment to the laws, which was
adopted, gives past grand presidents right
to vote.
A proposition to pay a claim to tho
named beneficiary of a member who at
the time of his death was not In good
standing was voted down.
Dr. Abrahams, member of the board of
the National .Home for Consumptives, ac
cepted an invitation to address the Grand
Lodge to-night.
In the evening the endowment feature
was again taken up, and it was decided to
continue the same on new lines.
Now that the Eastern people, many, of
whom are supposed to be homeseekers,
are coming into the State in large num
bers, the singular fact is discovered that
out of fifty-six counties less than one
score have made a move to place any lit
erature in this city describing their ad
vantages to the inquirers. This was as
certained by a visit to the State Board
of Trade rooms in the ferry building. Â»*t
that place one would naturally expect to
get all the necessary information about
the State, and that is the main consid
eration that called the institution Into ex
istence and gave it a location where it
Â¦would be in easy touch with all newcom
ers to California. Many counties that
sent in their publications some months or
years ago have since failed to renew the
supply, and the result is that they are un
represented at the timo when knowledge
about them will be eagerly sought by
thousands.
When Secretary Filcher of the State
Board of Trade was asked yesterday
where the responsibility for this condition
of affairs rested he promptly said that it
was on the counties that had failed to
keep themselves at- the front. He had per
sonally been to several counties recently,
asking them to get out literature of the
descriptive and statistical sort for use in
San Francisco, and also at the Pan-Amer

"One county, San Luis Obispo, respond-,
ed with promptness," said Mr. Filcher,
"and has within the past few days sent to
the board certain publications that may
be of advantage to it. Of course, the State
Board cannot show literature to visitors
if the counties do not forward it for dis
tribution. Often when requests have come
from the East by mail for information
concerning some particular section the
board has been unable to furnish it. The
only remedy that I know of is for the
counties to issue pamphlets at the earliest
possible moment.
"The board has no desire to discrim
inate, and does not. but when there is a
demand for information the board hands
out whatever it has. The counties repre
sented thus have the advantage in adver
tising their resources over other sections."
These are the only counties that are
ready to hand literature to thÂ© visiting
homeseekers in this city: Sacramento,
Fresno, Tulare, San Joaquin, Stanislaus,
Shasta. Napa, Humboldt, Santa Clara,
Modoc. San Luis Obispo, Tehama, Santa
Barbara. Inyo. Orange. Riverside. Los An
geles. Tuolumne and San Francisco. There
are localities in three other counties that
are represented by descriptive matter at
the State Board of Trade, these being
Capay Valley in Yolo, Haywards in Ala
meda and "Wvandotte and Thermallto in
Butte County. The showing will be sur
prising to the State at large.
Pacific Mail Company's ;Boat Has About 'Twenty-Four
Hours' Start, but Only Succeeds in Reaching Hawaiian
Capital Two Hours Ahead of the Oceanic Flier
THE Oceanic Company's mail
steamship Mariposa arrived from
â¢ Honolulu yesterday after a splen
did run of five days twenty hours
and twenty minutes. Never be
fore in her history has the Mariposa been
making such good time as she is now. On
the run to -Honolulu she beat the"China,
the crack boat of the Pacific Mail fleet,
by nearly a day. The China sailed twen
ty-four hours ahead of the Mariposa, but
the former vessel had only just tied up at
her wharf at Honolulu when the Mari
posa came along. It blew a gale the
whole way to Honolulu and it took the
China nearly seven days to make the run,
while the Mariposa went down in five
days, twenty-two hours and forty-two
minutes. On her way home she beat even
that time by two hours and twenty-two
minutes.
Among those who came up in the cabin
of the Mariposa were:
Miss Harriet Lewers, Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Lewers, Mrs. J. H. Craig and two children,
J H Payne, W. E. Ransome, Miss M. B.

Disposed Of at Auction to Eschen &
Minor for a Song. â¢
WRECfK OF PYRENEES.
The wreck of tho British ship Pyrenees
as it now lies in the harbor of Manga
Reva, in the Paumotu Group, was yester
day sold in the Merchants' Exchange to
Eschen & Minor for $235. The captain
thought it would at least bring $2500, but
it was only by the greatest perseverance
that the auctioneer got the small sum he
did. The Pyrenees left Tacoma' on Octo
ber 14 last with 3750 tons of wheat and
barley. On November 16 a fire broke out
In the cargo and an attempt was made to
beach the vessel on Pitcalrn Island. This
failed and she was then headed for Pa
peete. Tho fire got worse and worse, and
she was finally beached at Manga Reva.
From last accounts the flre was out ana
the masts still standing. If the vessel is
flooded, however, the wheat and barley
will swell and probably burst her decks
open. .. . .
About twenty-five years ago the ship
Ada Iredale went ashore near where the
wreck of the Pyrenees now lies, j She was
loaded with a cargo of coal and caught
flre. It was only when the last scrap of
coal had been consumed that the flre went
out. The hulk then drifted ashore and the
late A. Crawford secured it. He sent to
San Francisco for spars and rigged the
vessel up at Tahiti and sailed her here.
She was thoroughly refitted, and as the
bark Annie Johnson is now one of the
best known vessels on the coast.
Scare on ths Pike County.
The schooner Pike County was on fire
yesterday and as the flames were very
close to a leaking gasoline tank everybody
on board deserted the vessel, while the
crowd on the wharf sought safety in
flight. The fire tugs Governor Irwln and
Governor Markham were summoned and
with the aid of a chemical engine the
blaze was smothered. The vessel was only
slightly damaged.
Water Front Notes.
Reinsurance rates took a jump yester
day and three of the overdues are practi
cally uninsurable. The Andrada, out
ninety-nine days from Santa Rosalia: the
Bertha, from "Wei-Hal-Wel, and the Cape
Wrath, from Callao. all for Portland, are
now quoted at 90 per cent, while the
Ardnamurchen, seventy-eight days out
from the Frazen River, for Liverpool, is
quoted at 65 per cent, and the Henry
Hnckfleld, 1S9 days out from Philadelphia,
for Nagasaki, at 15 per cent.
The steamship Humboldt is out of her
winter quarters and is once more ready
for service. She leaves next Thursday,
frcm Mission-street wharf, for Eureka,
and from there she will go to Seattle.
From Seattle she will go on* the Skaguay
run during tho season.

Solari "Wants His Money.
Carlo Solari, whose money is -now In the
hands of the heirs of another who once
lived and bore the same name, has sued
tiie Hibernia Bank to recover $2200. the
sum paid the heirs of the other Solari un
der order of court. Solari simply sets up
his right to the money In question. The
opinion of the court will hence be expect
antly awaited.
The petition that was presented by the
Fruit Growers' Association to the South
ern Pacific. Union Pacific and Santa Fe
roada has started a great deal of discus
sion among railroad men. Although noth
ing definite has been done by the railroad
companies in reference to the fruit grow
ers' request that the time to Chicago be
cut to six days and the time to New Yorlt
to eight days, prominent freight officials
claim that it is almost an impossibility.
The freight officials argue that the best
that could be done in shipping 1 green fruit
Is as follows: Sixty hours from Sacra
mento to Ogden, sixty hours from Ogden
to Council Bluffs ana twenty-four hours
from Council Bluffs to Chicago, making
in all 144 hours or six days. They claim,
that .when the fruit" cars arrive in Chi
cago there is a delay of twelve hours, in
which time they have to switch the cars
and till them with fresh ice. It then tak?3
two days to New York. This would make
It eight and one-half days to Xew York.
The fruit grrowers want the trip done In
eight days, but from present Indications
It looks an if it -will be impossible to com
ply with their request unless the time be
tween Sacramento and Ogden Is short
ened.
Six I>ays the Best Schedule They
Could Offer Between Here and
Chicago With Refrigera
tor Cars.
Railroad Officials Affirm
Past Time on Fruit
Impossible.

J^ 7i/t I.TflF. M V. N TS.XEW TOEK. Feb. IS.â To-<lny -was one of
active epeculative liquidation tn the stock mar
ket. The bears took a very active part In the
day's rroceedings, both by short selling and
by manipulation for the decline, offering prices
down freely and boldly. There was not much
evidence of determined support except by the
rympathrtlc Influence cf the persistent strength
cf a few individual clocks. Besides the ex
traordinary movement in the eteel stocks there
was decided atrexurth shown by the new To
ledo, St. Louis and Western stocks, Str
Louls and E&n Francisco . second preferred,
Illinois Central, Amalgmated Copper and Con
solidated GÂ»Â». There was evidence of con
tinued activity on the part of a bull pool In
Liverpool and other grangers showed some
sympathy at one time. There was some sup
port at Intervals, also rympathy with Dela
ware and Hudson, which was extremely erratic
ull day. It sold down 2 points and then got
Â£14 ovÂ«- Saturday. There was a downward
plunge In tbe period of general wt-akness of S
points and the final rally left the net loss
only IV In the steel stocks lt was clear
enough that speculators were attempting to
ad1u5t prices to the supposed terms of ex
change of the existing securities Into the stock
of the new combination. The tape made lt
pretty clear that in the present condition of
the Â»4an of comblnatlen the preferred stocks
ere Intended to benefit In the exchange far
more th&n the common stocks. The first claÂ»s
Â«aÂ« extraordinarily buoyant and the common

4%i by Fed/ral StÂ«^l. 4 by Steel and Wire ami
2ii by nepu"blic Kteel. These advances were
.unÂ»;M by tbÂ« reaction In the market. Na
tional Tube led the decline In the . common
etooks cf the tteel companies, breaking 7 full
points, and closing at the lowest. The losses
cf the other* were partly recovered, but at one
time Colorado Fuel was down 4>4.' National

T'late 2V In the general list the reaction ran
ell the Â»Â«)â¢ from 1 to J'.S points. The wider
ln<ses were among those, storks, which have
been mwt manipulated for an advance, notably
the Southwestern*, including Missouri Pacific
and Kansas and Texas preferred and some of
the lately developed obscure stocks, mich â¢ a*
n\-p.r.svi;ie and Terre Haute and the new North
American stock. It was clear the dubious our

cause of the liquidation and not any serious

Wheat yielded the palm to Corn' without -r a
protest and followed the larger market .with
great docility. Tim pit most of the sescion was
half deserted. May opened unchanged to H@^Â«c
higher at 75Vi@75Â«4c, . Influenced chiefly by the
opening Corn strength, although steady cables
and moderate Northwest receipts were contrlb
utary factors. New commission houBe buying,
coupled with covering by nervous shorts, caused
an early advance to â¢ 75T4c. The Corn break
caused a reaction to 75c, and the close was
easy; May, %Â®%c lower at 75@75',4c.
CHICAGO, Feb. lS.-Corn held undisputed

May opened Uc higher at 41Â»i@4196c There
was nothing particularly striking either in the
crop situation or the statistical- reports, but
ehorts were clamorous In ISelr -demands. Sev

figures, and after touching 4l>iÂ«j 41',i<! the mar
ket was suddenly bid up to 41%c. Scarcely any
Corn changed hands on -this bulge. It seemed
as If everybody was a would-be purchaser.
Suddenly the market began to crumble. Where
a few minutes before scarcely any, Corn was to
be had millions of bushels were for sale. One
speculator was credited with getting rid of
S.CCO.OOO bushels, and others were not far be

of stop-loss orders en the decline, which the
beam were able to effect. With the wiping
out o' margins, stocks were thrown on the
market to protect brokers and commission
house? which were carrying them for the cus
tomers. The call loan rate went to 2Â«Â£ per
cent during the day. but dropped back to 2
per cent, partly due to the receipt of a $300.0iX>
credit by one of the banks for Australian
gold arrived at San Francisco. There Is no ex
pectation, however, that closer conditions in
the money market will be escaped In the near
future. Bankers continue to express confidence
that there will be no actual stringency, but
such large requirements for credits to the
heavy financial transactions In oroRress still
remain to be met that sentiment over the

NEW YORK. Feb. 1?.â Friends of cotton had
a trying time on 'Change to-day, while bears
scored successes the equal of which have not
been noted .in many weeks. The feature of
to-day's operations was the liquidation of Inrire
holdings by disheartened longs and the selling
of near- months by the reneral market. The
market opened stendy. with neer months 7
points higher to unchanged and far months un
changed to one point lower. The stability waa
ot brief duration, as soon after the call great
blocks of March cotton came out hurriedly,
which started active liquidation of May and
July.
New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â Business in tin In the
local metal market *was again fairly active' In
a speculative way with the feeling quite firm
at an advance of about 10 points. The strength
was lnj^art due to favorable Information from
London and the large shipments from this
country. Further advance, however, was ar
rested by expectations of heavy arrivals of tin
within the next week. The close here was firm
at 527*527 Cu, while at London final prices were
Â£123 10s for spot. The rest of the general list
displayed little If any .Important developments,
with trading chiefly of a hand-to-mouth order.
Copper remains in a small nominal condition,
closing at $17 for Lake Superior and $16 22 for
casting and electrolytic. Lead, though not
quotably lower, hori an easy undertone as the
result of the depression at London, where prices
closed at Â£14 17s 6d and the increase in present
stocks 'here. The close was dull at $t 37'i.
Spelter ruled quiet at $3 97Hrt?4 Co. while do
mestic iron markets exhibited a weak under
tone, but prices, however, remain practically
unchanged at $3 SOiJTlO 50 for plglron warrants.

in New York Central, St. Paul and Southern
Pacific.
Though business on the Stock Exchange here
was meager to-day, the tendency of the gen

cheerful. This was due in part to the hope
that we have Dewet cornered, partly because

KILLS THE BULLY WHO
HOLDS HIM OVER STOVE
Slayer of Harry Rowand at De Nbro
Surrenders and Pleads
Self-Defense.
GREENWOOD, B. C. Feb. IS.â James
F. McGill de Riverre is In jail charged
with the murder of Harry Rowand, who
was killed at Dc Noro last night. De
Riverre is a .French Canadian, who
formerly was a civil engineer in, the ser
vice of the Crows Nest Pass Railway.
He has lately been made the victim of
several practical Jokesat the De Noro
mining camp. De Riverre killed Rowand
with a four-inch caseknife, and while De
Riverre admits that it was his hand that
gave the fatal blow, he declares It was in
self-defense. Circumstantial evidence In
a measure confirms this view, for Rowand
had been drinking, and not finding much
excitement in joking the little Frenchman
attempted to hold him over a red-hot
stove. It was then that the knife was
used. De J Riverre subsequently surren
dered to the provincial police. The de
ceased was formerly a railway paymaster
in the East. _ ._

he would do everything he could to bring It

and that Is the last time I have talked with
Mr. IMngee from that time to this.
Mr. Dingee seems to be In trouble Just now,

to be in trouble until he reforms enough to
permit him to tell all the truth and only the
truth. At the present time he Is industriously

CLASS GRADUATED AT
WEST POINT ACADEMY
Unusually Large Number of Men As
signed to the Engineering
Corps.
WEST POINT. Feb. 13.â The exercises
connected with the graduation of the first
class cadets of the military academy took
place in Cullom memorial building to-day
in the presence of the entire battalion and
many of their friends. The address to the
class of seventy-three members was de
livered by General John R. Brooke, com
manding the Department of the East, who
also delivered the diplomas. Secretary of
War Root had been expected to perform
this offlce, but he was unable to be pres
ent. The early graduation of the class
this year was necessitated by the reor
ganization of the army. The men gradu
ated to-day will be given a furlough un
til March 10. after which many of them
will be assigned to duty in the Philippines.
Albert B. Mueller of Illinois, a member of
the class, will not be permitted to gradu
ate until June. He was court-mariialed.
and is under sentence for a breach of dis
cipline.
The first ten members of the cla*3 will
be assigned to the engineers' branch of
the service. They are:
Johnson. Oregon: Sherrill, North Caro
lina- Poole, "Wisconsin; Peck. Wisconsin:
Lee. North Carolina; Spauldlng. Michi
gan; Dent. Pennsylvania; Caples. Mis
souri: Jewett. New York, and' Williams.
Missouri. '>*'_â¢
This Is an unusual assignment, five be
ing the usual number allotted.
The six following will have their choice
between ordnance, artillery, cavalry or
! infant ry. Then thirty-two may go into
i either the artillery, cavalry or Infantry.
. The remainine have a choice only be-
I tween the cavalry and Infantry.
Owing to the death here on Saturday of
Colonel Peter S. Mitchie of the Academic
Board, the usual festivities attending the
graduation exercises were dispensed with.
Cuts Down Government Normal Ma-
FTEST DIVISION OF
NEW PARLIAMENT
â¢jority of One Hundred and
Thirty to Forty-Five.
LONDON. Feb. 18.â The First IMvtslon
of the first Parliament of King 1 Edward
"VII, which took place yesterday, resulted
In cutting down to 43 the Government's
normal majority of 13T>. The. interest
caused by this unexpected, event was
heightened by Winston Churchill's first
speech at Westminster, and Mr. Cham
berlain's heated defense of his own policy.
The extraordinary slimness of the ma
jority of this strongest British Govern
ment of modern times was the result of
Lord Cranborne's refusal to answer ques
tions relating 1 to the Government's for
eign policy without previous notice from
the questioners. John EHUon aelsed the
opportunity, and In spite of an unusually
large attendance, almost placed the Con
servative party in "queer street."
In tlie course of an interview Mr. Dillon
explained: "What it all means is that the
Government will be obliged to revoke the
arbitrary ruling made by- Mr. Balfour
that under secretaries of state are not
obliged to answer questions addressed to
"Trie question !Â» more Important than
It appears to be on the> surface, for. if
Mr. Balfour's ruling should bÂ« followed,
it would prevent the Irish members from
questioning tho Irish Secretary, and
eventually deprive us of all right of free
speech." -

to-day to Joseph S. Silverberg. who rep
resents a number of Eastern creditors.
For forty years the store has been lo
cated at So.nta Clara and Market streets.
Recently Silverberg obtained judgments
nmountlng to more than $43,000. Under
Sheriff Varcoe sold the store to-day for
$3?.o00.
The financial embarrassment of the firm
was brought about through the divorce
troubles of H. M. N. Spring, owner of a
half-interest in the store, and his wife,
Mrs. Emilie T. Spring. Mrs. Spring ob
tained a divorce and $200 a month ali
mony, and Spring fled East to escape pay
ing the alimon;-. For the past two years
litigation over Spring's interest in the
store has been before the courts, and it
finally wrecked the business. A few
weeks ago Mrs. Spring purchased her
husband's interest in the store for $3800,
which sum was due for alimony, and she
probably will contest the sale made to
day.

OAKLAND, Feb. 18.â The politicians
have been furnished with fuel
from both sides in the battle that
has opened between William J.
Dingee, vice president of the Con
tra Costa Water Company, and G. B. Dan
iels, manager of the Oakland Enquirer,
who, acordlng to the water magnate,
asked Dingee to liquidate a $55,000 debt in
return for the assumption of friendly re
lations with the water company on the
part of ,the Enquirer.
Dlngee comes forward to-day with a
lengthy statement, in which he specifical
ly makes the charge as aforesaid. He an
nounces that the alleged negotiations
were started nearly a year ago, when Dr.
George C. Pardee came to his office to se
cure the water company's Influence to
ward the selection of a president of the
City Council to succeed H. D. Rowe. Din
gee declares that, he was sent to Daniels
by Pardee In connection with the En
quirer's attitude toward the water com
pany. Then Dlngee proceeds to give his
version of a meeting which took place be
tween himself and Daniels at the Enquirer
office. Here the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's affairs were discussed, and here,
say* Dingee, the. $55,000 proposition was
made.
Dingee further relates that he made a
counter offer of his company's printing
and a bonus of $150 a month.
Daniels, in a signed statement to-day,
! based upon the published story of Din
gee's charges makes the unequivocil re
ply that Dlngee"s SD5.000 recital Is a "de
; liberate and willful Me." Manager Dan
! iels gives at some length his version of
the meeting between himself and Dingee.
Daniels asserts that the advances were
made by Dlngee. who asked If he (Dan
iels) ha'd any objection to a call. When
he wtnt to the Enquirer office Dingee
made the flat proposition of printing, etc..
declares the manager of the paper, and it
was spurned.
The statement made by Dlngee Is as fol
lows:
Ready for Reporters.
I read the article in this morning's Call, and
as I expect the reporters will be around to
day, 1 have dictated this' statement for each.
I did remark in crossing the ferry on Satur
day that Daniels of the Enquirer was dishon
estly Inspired Jn attacking the Contra Costa
Water Company and myself personally. It was
In the presence of two or three gentlemen,
and 1 thought it would end there, and regret
that it did not, as I shrink from newspaper
prominence. However, a representative of The
San Francisco Call visited me at my home on
Sunday evening and wanted to know the de
rails of my relations with Daniels. I asked
The Call man not to print anything until
Wednesday, by which time I would have a
statement. He agreed to do it. but I find a
reference to it in to-day's. Call. Substantially
these are the facts:
It was in March or April of last year that
Dr. George C. Pardee called on me personally,
and In the presence of Mr. Watklnson asked
me to exercise the water company's Influence
in the matter of electing a chairman of the
City Council to succeed Mr. Rowe, whose term
was about to expire. The doctor came to the
Contra Coeta Water Company's office, where
I was. He stated to me what he wanted, and
I told him that I could not see how my In
terests would be benefited in the selection of
Mr. Taylor, whom the doctor favored, or Mr.
Baretow. whom the doctor opposed. . Both men
were equally antagonistic to my property in
terests and both had made an effort to con
fiscate the Contra Costa Water Company's
property, and have admitted In writing that
they had not connulted an engineer or an ex
pert in the matter of determining the value of
the property. I told the doctor that I did
not see that I had any Influence in the Coun
cil but he insisted that if I wanted to I
could get him a vote over from Barstow to
Taylor. He said hell would pop and that it
would be to my interest to stand by him in
1 that fight, and I construed his remarks Into
: a threat. I said:
Advised to See Daniels.
"Doctor, most pecple believe- that you own
the Enquirer with Mr. Dalton. Why do you
pursue the company so relentlessly and permit
the paper to make statements which you know
to be false?" He smiled, but sRld. "Tou had
better see Daniels. He is running the paper."
"Well," I replied, "you fix an appointment and
1 will meet him any time you say." "Â£ee
him to-morrow," said the doctor, "and I will
amiTigf? for a pl*Â»apant reception for you."
Some days later I met Mr. Daniels, but not
until Mr. Pardee again asked me why I had
not seen Mr. Daniels, as Dr. Pardee had ar
ranged. We talked quite awhile before
we cot down to business. Mr. Daniels
paid he was running the Enquirer to make
mon*y; th-it by silence on Its part I
could make money, but if he turned the paper
locse none could make a cent; a great deal
of white paper. Ink and editorial ability would
be thrown away, while Contra Costa Water
dlviden4s would be smaller than what they
were. As near as I can recal It, these were
his exact words.
I said: "I appreciate what you say and
would like to make term* with you. *AH I
want is an opportunity to do business in the
town in peace. What is your proposition, Mr
Daniels?" He stated at first that he. had
none to make, but would listen to any that
I had to make to him. I told him to let me
know exactly what he wanted, and that I
would then let him know what I was able to
do. He then became very confidential and
drew very close to me. Although there was
no ore else In the room he spoke in. an ab
solute whisper.
'1 owe," he said, "$5o.0M. at th<> Central
Bank. Dr. Pardee and Mr. Dalton have Joined
with me in the debt. The bank Is not crowd
ing us for the money, for it Is amply secured.
Nevertheless I would like this obligation out
cf the way, as you . know interest eats a
follow up."
These last are his exact words. I then said:
"Mr. Daniels, you want the water company
t.-> put up $53,000. do you?" He said: "Yes;
but it need not be at once, but could scatter
o^-er a couple of years." I was completely
dumfounded at the siie of his. demand.
I then said to Mr. Daniels: "I will tell you
what I will do. I will give you all the "job
printing of the water company's office, I w m
continue -to patronize you In my real estate
business, as I have In the past, and I will
pay you out of my own pocket $150 a month."
He looked me in the face for fully a minute
Â«nd then said. "I guess you don't realize the
Influence of the Enquirer." . I said that I did.
bat that I could not afford; nor could the
company, to pay him any such sum as he
demanded. - ...
. - Began a Bitter Attack.
H> said: "Well, you think it over and we
will have a talk 'at- Â«ome future date."
At this we separated. Since then the En
quirer has been more bitter and vicious than
ever toward the Contra ' Costa .Water Com
pany. Every day that our trial has been on
In the courthouse and it had present a re
porter, and every day that reporter's account
of what has occurred there, has been mis
representing In the extreme. The paper has
caricatured me and has misrepresented the
Contra Costa Water Company at every op
portunity.
Mr." Dalton. the â¢ Assessor, raised the com
pany's taxes, a large portion of which goes
to the State, which In former years he-per
mitted'to remain at a fairly . moderate figure.
As "nls assessment is accepted by the city, we
have had to contribute its amount to the local
government. . . â¢
A preposterous statement was made a month
ago or bo relative to ' a certain Mr. Long.
The water company was accused by the Â¦ En-"
ouirer of paying this man, through an agent,
the fabulous sum of $5000 for - his vote tn t ho
city committee. This is too ridiculous to need
contradiction. I do not know what the effect
of this, statement will be on. the campaign
that is now on. nor do I care. I have simply
determined that my friends , shall know the
real motive behind- the Enquirer's.- personal
attack upon the company and, myself.
Daniels' Flat Denial.
Following is G. B. Daniels statement:;'
My attention has been called to an article in
a San Francisco newspaper in which Mr. W.
J. Dinree is reported to have Bald that tne
reason for the "spirit and vehemence of thÂ»
Enquirer's courye In assailing him was inspired
by his refusal to pay the paper's bank oMIsa
tion, amounting to J55.00O."
That statement is a deliberate and .vlllful lie,
as no request to ray fcS.OGO or any other sun
was ever made by me to Mr. Dingee.
Mr. Dlngee for purposes of hie own is put
ting forth the statement to injure the En
quirer and to affect the present political cam-
Fialgn. In this attempt he misrepresented the
acts of the Interview which was held in the
Enquirer office and which was sought by him
and not by me. I never gave any intimation
to any one that I desired to pee Mr. Dl'ijje-;.
but he telephoned to me and asked me if he
could see me at the Enquirer office. Upon be
ing answered that I had nu objection to see
ing him at that time he came to the Enquirer
oftice and. after saying that he wished to have
the friendship and co-operation of the Er,
qulrer. he proceeded to make a proposition, lie
said that if tho Enquirer would be friendly to
the Contra Costa Water Company he would
give It all the printing of the company, which,
he said, amounted to quite a sum, and also |1">>
per month.
I answered Mr. Dlngee by telling him that
while neither myself nor any person conniKfil
with the Enquirer had anything against him
personally, the editorial and news columift; of
the iiaper wer* not for sale.
He' answered: "Well, yon had better think
it over. We want ti !>e Iriendly." This eioseil
the conversation. Not a word was eaid by him
or me about Â£>S.0CO. and neither was such a
matter discussed at any other time when I
saw Mr. Dlngee. At the time Mr. Dingee came
to the Enquirer office and made the proposition
mentioned I understood clearly that he wvtnt*.il
to buy the influence of the piper, but I de
clined to countenance the proposition.
Slne>Â» the time of the Interview above Â»e
ferred to Mr. D!nfr<*Â« has twice, when wt hap
rÂ«r.etl to meet, asked me if I was yet "ready to
do business." One of these occasions wa* In
!j*n Trancisco and one in Oakland. I a'.wayi
Â»*Â¦.!? .vered Mr. Dlngee that the influence of the
Kr.ouirer was no; for sale.
I wish to add that the Enquirer is not seek
ing to have any one ral;e any bank or othei In
debtedness, and that the officers of the con.
pany will take care of Its finances and can and
will meet all its obligations when due.
G. B. DANIELS.
Manager Oakland Enquirer Publishing Corn
pan y.
Dr. George C Pardee to-night gave out
the following strange statement:
Pardee Says Nay.
I see that Mr. W. J. Dingee. vice president
of the Contra. Costa Water Company, has pub
lished ii> the water company orean. the Oak
land Tribune, a statement in which he mlxfs
falsehood and truth as only a man of' Mr.
Dlngee's versatility, under the tutelage of his
friend, counselor and guide, Mr. Frank J.
Moffltt. can mix them; It is true, as Mr. Dln
ceÂ» says, that I saw him last March. To be
exact, .It was on Saturday, the 17th of. March,
at about 10 a. m.. at his San Francisco office
in the Mills building, and my business "with
him was In regard to a piec* of property on
San Pablo avenue, in Oakland, which I had
bought through him and on which a client of his
held and still holds a mortgage. My business
â¢with him was completed. I arose to go, but
Dlngee detained me and began to talk to me
about his water business. He and I had al
ways been friendly, and he assured me then,
as he had many times before, that he was
under great personal obligations to me for
favors that I had donÂ» him before he betrayed
the city of Oakland and became the vice presi
dent of the Centra Costa Water Companv. In
the course of the conversation he asked "me if
I owwd the KnQulrer. and I told him I did
not. 1 do not remember to have told him. as
he says I did. that "Hâ 11 would pop," but I
rather think he will think it has popped be
fore he gets through with his attempts tf> help
the Contra Costa Water Company rob the peo
ple of Oakland.
After a good deal of beating about th* bush
Dlneee finally wanted to know whether I
could help him get the Enquirer to stop at
tacking the water company. I ; told him that
I could not; that the Enquirer, so far as I
knew, could not be influenced to bÂ»tray the
people in the interest of any one. even Mr.
Dingee and the Contra Costa Water Company.
Then Dlngee asked me to manage an interview
between him and Mr. Daniels, the manager of
the Enquirer. I refused to do so. saying that
he could call Daniels up by telephone ami
make his offn appointments. And when Mr.
Dlngee says that I advised him to see Dan
iel* he does not tell the truth. Nor is his
statement true that I told him to "seÂ« him
to-morrow and I will arrange a pleasant re
; ceptlon for you." I saw Mr. Dlngee on a Sat
urdny. â¢ Is It likely that I would adviÂ«e him
to see Daniels "to-morrow"â Sundayâ the day
on which the Enquirer offleÂ» Is closed?
Dingee "Was Insistent."
When I got up nÂ«?aln to go Dlngee again
detained m* and began to talk about the' elec
tion for president of the Oakland City Coun
cil that was to take place In a few days. Ho
told rne that the water company was in favor
of the selection of Mr. BarPtow as president
of the Council, and asked me if I had any
interest in the matter. I told him I had not
much Interest In It. but that It reemed to me
that It was high time for- the Contra. Costa
"Water Company to keep Its nose out of Oak
land city politics and to -stop trying to control
the City Council. To this Dingee replied that
the water company had too much at stake to
nult and that the company would, of couras.
continue to try ami control the Council, as that
body had to fix water rate*.
Finally I saWto him that, in my opinion,
it would be best for him if he used his influ
ence with the company to have the company
let the City Council alone. To this Dingee
replied that his company had one or two votes
in the Council that it could control, but that
Mr. Watklnson, the president of the com
rany. did the company's politics. Aftor con
siderable more talk Dlngee a<>ked me to see
â¢\Vatkinson that afternoon at 6 o'clock; that
he (Dlngee), would be at the company's office,
but that he would not like to have Watkin
rdn know that he (Dingee) had been talking
to me as plainly as he had. I then- left Din
gee's otflce and went to my ' own.
That afternoon, on njy way home, I stepped
In to the Contra I Cof<ta Water Company's
office. I Dingee and Watkinson were both there.
Dlngee began the conversation by telling Wat
kinson that he had been talking with -me about
the presidency of the Council, and that I had
bf*n urging him <Dingee) to get the water
company to keep out of politics, and that he
(Dlngee) w^uld like to get me to do what I,
could to have the Enquirer "be good" to ths
water company. .,
I told them that I old not think the En
quirer could be induced to "be good" to the
water company, but that if,, the company
v/ould keep out of politics and let the Council
clone it would probably, stand a much better
chance of better treatment at the Enquirer's
hands. Both i Dlngee and Watkinson. loudly
protested that the company had no choice in
the matter of the presidency of the Council
and that the company was not interested in
politics. Remembering what Dlngee had al
ready told me, and knowing better anyhow. I
told them I knew they could control , at least
cne Councilman.' and named him.- After a
good deal of talk Mr. Watklnson said that he
would Bee this Councilman and see what he
1 bad to say. but that he did not think he could
do anything, with., him. Â¦ ,.
Asked to, See Mr.; Watkinson.
The following Monday morning, April 19
19W). at -10 o'clock. -I wsnt again to : Dlngee's
office in- the Mills building- concerning my
business about the mortgage. Â¦'.. There â¢ was not
much Â«aJd about politics at this . Interview,
except that Dlngee eald that he had not seen
Mr. Watklnson, but asked me to go-and see
him. - Â¦ â¢ Â¦Â» -,-.â¢',.,
. At about 9 o'clock on the morning of Thurs
day, March' 22, in accordance with. Dlngee'*
request, I went to see Mr. Watktnson in the
water company 1 !! office. Mr. I Watklnson then
told me that he had seen the Councilman but
thar he could do -nothing with him. :Â¦'. Mr.
Watklnson then : deplored the fact j that the
water company was accused of being: in poll
tics - and that .'all the company wanted was
to be let alone. . Remembering what, Dlneee
had told me I-toId Mr. WatkJnson that I had
no doubt but that the water company was ' In
terested in the election of Mr. â¢ Barstow' as
president of thp Council, , but â¢ that the , water
company would, of course, contlnua to do as
it pleased. â¢â¢ -." v Â¦ . â¢ . . , - '

In surrebuttal and County Attorney Fred
H. Boardman at once b*san his address
to the jury. He declared that it was ju-5t
as certain that Hamilton killed Day as M
was certain that Day was dead. â¢ The
State had shown the motive for the crime
and the confession by the accused of h's
guilt, and yet with the ablest counsel, in
ti.e State, ; he now came into court and
asked for acquittal, when in savage jeal
ousy he had stabbed Day to death. This
was monstrous, but no more monstrous
than that this jury shoujd be asked -o
stab society on Hamilton's account. Mr.
Penney, ot the defense, had gone out of
his way to traduce the character of the
victim and to hold the defendant up as a
gzntleman or education. But the court
room was a place for justice not for sym
pathy.
Mr. Boardman adverted to the fact that
Hamilton himself, on the stand, did not
deny the crime. He did not deny the con
fession to Rooney. He had come back to
the dead bcdy sobered by what had hap
pened, not to offer a silent prayer with
Bennett, but to lay beside the body the
bloody knife with which he had done tue
deed. "When Hamilton went out and re Â¦
turned with that open knife clutched In
his overcoat pocket, he intended murder
deliberate, premeditated murder. The
motive was Jealousy.'
Frank M. Nye, in h's address for tic
defense, declared that with the exception
of the ready-made confession of the police
officer, no testimony has been adduced
that would not have been relevant in an
action against any of the others. The
confession would have been the same with
the name changed, no matter who was on
trial. Where did this bloody knife come
from? There is not a scintilla of evidence
to trace the ownership to Hamilton. That
knife belonged to some one in the Weet
Hotelâ we have brought forward evidence
to show that It belonged to Day. Hamil
ton had no motive for Injuring Day. but
Day did have one for injuring Hamilton.
Judge Brooks gave his charge to the
Jury immediately. It was a clear exposi
tion of the law and the evidence and was
listened to attentively by the Jury, which
was then sent out for deliberation.-
At midnight the Jury was still out ani
Judge Brooks left for his home. The ver
dict. If reached to-night, will not V>e
known until court meets to-morrow morn-
Ing at 9. ;

STRENGTH TESTS.
A Record After Using Different
Foods.
J. Henry Myers of Otsego. Mich., a
traveling representative of a certain medi-
cal missionary association, made some
Ftrerjgth xeetsf with different foods, with
the following result: He says: "In JS37
I became officially connected with an in-
fituUon manufacturing a large line of
h^alfTi for>Â«>.
"My o>?ire was to add strength. I was
In good health, and faithfully lived, al-
m^5t entirely, for nearly two yeari", on
thr-lr foods, and believed In them thor-
oughly. In January, *9S. my strength
test showed r.TOO pound?; in January, '99,
by the Fair." machine, my strength test
xras only 450A pound?, a heavy falling off.
notwithstanding I had not been rick, but
had faithfully and religiously used the
frjoHs I fo fully relieved in and had been
hired to lecture for and advocate.
"For a month after that test I was un-
certain what to do. I felt weak, and
â¢what I wanted was strength; so in Feb-
ruary of that year I quit all other health
foods and began using Grape-Nuts alone.
My weight now has Increased from 130
to'lC pounds; my strength has Increased
from <560 pounds to 6340 and I am now
JCO pounds stronger, by actual test, than
tb.f) average man. My eyesight Is clearer,
rry mind more active and stronger, and I
can endure more labor, physical and
ir.^r.'al, than ever before.
"I <io not know any person interested
In the Ponum Cereal Co.. Ltd., and this
Mtfr iÂ« not written with any motive, ex-
cept tr, bring honest facts to the attention
of person* deslrng to live well and live
raiiorally. I have the charts filled out by
the physicians at the Institution making
tne health foods that failed In my case,
and these facts cannot be disputed by any
one. I wiJl make oath that they are ab-
solutely correct."
â¢ Mr. Myers 1 letter gives the name In full
.cf the concern making the so-called
health foods, which failed In his case, but
this name is not given to the public It
is not the purpose of the manufacturers
cf Grape-Nuts to build their business by
*5e^reciatSr!g the efforts of any competitor.
.This experience is printed as an illustra-
tion Kit the indisputable fact that Grape-
Nuts food is a true, honest and remark-
able rcbuilder of the human body.

Denounces Yoshiwara* System.
. HONOLULU, Feb. 12.â The second
Grand Jury ever convened in Ho
nolulu Is now in session. In his
charge to the jury Judge Humphreys
strongly and eloquently denounced the
Yoshiwara system that has been in vogue
in Honolulu ever since the great fire of a
year ago burned out the inhabitants of
the tenderloin of thofe days. The Judge
declared that .â¢ the -Ypshiwara. In which
there are now about 150 women, was a
disgrace to the community and he called
upon the. Grand Jurv to look into . the
matter. ' By inference he accused the
High Sheriff of conniving at violations of
the law, and he declared that some per
sons high in locaJ nffairs were receiving
revenue from the Yoshiwara, which is at
all times under the strict surveillance of
the Boardof Health and the police. Tha
charge also contained an elaborate argu
ment for municipal . Incorporation, which
has been the subject of much controversy.
Severe Storm in the Hawaiis.
HONOLULU, Feb. 12.â The heaviest
storm that has been experienced here
since 18S9 has almost completely tied
up shipping in- Honolulu harbor and
all : over ; the -islands for about a
week past. It began on Monday, the 4th.
when a southerly gale rose, with every
sign of.one of the south sea storms known
here as konas. For the. next few. days it
was not possible for any vessel to leave
the harbor of HoYiolulu, and at other isl
and points vessels hugged lea shores and
waited for better weather. In spite of the
severity of the blow, which was accom
panied by. very heavy rains and a bril
liant electric storm, very little damage is
reported from any point so far. Reports
from Hawaii and Maul have not yet been
received, owing to the delays, of vessels.
The island steamer Mauna Loa has now
been held in Honolulu for a w*k, waiting
for better weather before she would.leave.
REDWOOD CITY, Feb. IS.â J. L. Fra

of the Southern Pacific Railroad/appeared
before the Board of Supervisors this
morning and a^ked that action on the pe

county be continued for two weeks. His
request was granted.
The petition asks for the repeal of an or
dinance which limits the Bpeed of all
trains over road crossings to ten miles an
hour unless gates are constructed and op
erated at such crossings. The ordinance
probably will Â¦ be amended to compel the
construction of gates at the most danger
ous crossings and the placing of bells at
others.

ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 18.â In the of
ficial report of the fire which broke out
February 5 in the magazine of the Cas
pian and Black Sea Company at Baku and
which spread to other depots, it Is admit
ted that 121 fatalities resulted from the
conflagratiol. and that in addition a num
ber of persons are expected to die from
the results of their burns. The search for
bodies is still being carried on.
West Indies Still for Sale.
COPENHAGEN. Feb. IS.â The state
ments published "{n London to the effect
that the sale ol' the Danish West Indies
to the United States has been abandoned
is not well founded. On the contrary the
negotiations are advancing, with pros
pects of- an agreement. The delay was
caused by further consultations with the
Rigsdag. . v '

PITTSBURG. Feb. J8.-M. Hecko of this
city was shot while defending himaelf
from being robbed by three negro high
waymen at McKoÂ«?s Rocks, near here,
shortly after midnisftt and he died this
morning. Two negroes were arrested and
are being held on suspicion.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. lS.-i-On Satur
day the Minister of the Interior. M.
Slpiaguine. ordered the suppression for
thiee months of the Novostl Dnja. a Mos
cow newspaper, which had violated the
prohibition against the publication of uni
versity bulletins. A secret circular has
been issued reminding all the newspapers
that the prohibition is now effective.
Information has been received here
that 220 students have taeen arrested in
Moscow, presumably the whole assembly
which obstructed the lectures emong the
students.
Eighteen students were arrested here,
but were subsenuently released. Pending
a. decision in their cases, however, they
were forbidden to re-enter* the university.
Sixteen additional arrests were subse
quently made. ri f!
The Forestry Institute, near by, held a
meeting and declared the instltue closed
until the sentences against the students
should be revoked and military law re
pealed.
The Institute of Railway Engineers, by
a vote of 230 against 100, declared for ob
struction. The Military and Medical
Academy students met, with the permls-
. 0I J,? f General Kouropatkin, the Minister
or War. the latter merely warning them
that he could not prevent the operation of
military law if obstructionary tactics
were adopted. Of the 800 who were pres*
ent at the meeting only 159 favored ob
struction. J^esolutlona. were adopted ex
pressing great discontent with the sen
tences imposed at Kieff and with military
law generally, but it was admitted, that
obstruction cannot lead to any desirable
result. Furthermore, the meeting de
clared its conviction that the- students at
other institutions would reach equally
sensible conclusions if they were granted
similar liberties.

The Dowieites claim in defense of their
action that two months ago the. woman
was given up by the doctors and that
what they did was a last resource.
Though no ofljeial action has yet been
taken, the probability is that the case w.'ll
be taken up by the medical council.
During the last three weeks of her ill
ness no medicine was given to Mrs.
Fleishman. Her removal to the head
quarters of ' the Dowieites i caused her
much suffering in the weakened condition
she was then in and she steadily grew
worse. .
On Saturday Mrs. Fleishman died and
her body was removed to the undertaker's
in the ordinary course of events. On Sun
day, two young sons of ' Fleishman, who
had also been staying: at the Simmons
residence with their- - mother, failed to
come home and it was found, that they
were being held until the money, amount
ing to about $100, had been paid. Fleish
man quickly paid this sum and" the boys
were returned home.

Hebrew resident of this city, died, after
suffering for some time \ with cancer.
Three weeks before her demise she was
removed, to the residence-, of Elder Slm
mons, who is in charge of the Dowle com
munity here. ' It was. agreed between
Fleishman and the Dowieites that he
snould pay $15 a week for- her room and
$70 for a fortnight's prayers in her behaif.
Fleishman did this at .the earnest entreaty
of his sick wife, as she believed in faith

CLEVER FARCE
was forhldden. Even the lily bulbs and
the "sugarcane, could â¢ not be sold on the
streets, and the pigtail people were dis
consolate. This year they were accorded
every privilege and great preparation3
were. made. But the rain spoiled all the
first-day plans, and except for the array
of lanterns and the closed stores no evi
dences of a celebration were apparent.
The first day of the Chinese New Year
Li spent bv the Mongolians In visiting one
another. Women as well as men partici
pate. While a Chinese may appear on the
street at any other season greasy and
ragged, . he always reserves one suit of
good clothes for this occasion, ajid the
throng of Celestials takes on an appear
ance of brightness and prosperity. Women
and children are particularly attractive.
Arrayed in the most costly silks of the
most fantastic colors, they pass to and
fro on the thoroughfares, furnishlne a
scene Orientally spectacular. . Yesterday
there was nothing of this sort, and many
white people who visited Chinatown were
badly disappointed..
The spirit of the celebration was not
broken, however, in the homes and joss
houses. The sound of drums and tom
toms- greeted the ear and feasts- were In
progress during the day. The festivities
will continue during the week, but thÂ«
business houses will reopen Â¦ after three
days.
NEARLY one thousand players gathered round the
card tables In the Maple and Marble halls of the
Palace Hotel last evening to take part In the great
progressive whist and euchre tournament given by the
whist section of the California Club. The affair was a
tremendous success. The ladies handled the immense crowd
easily, and there was not a solitary hitch in all the evening's
entertainment.
The whist players outnumbered the devotees of euchre, but
the euchreltes made up in merriment during* the progress of
their game for the numbers they lacked. [ In the whist room
all was silence and concentration, and the ladles of the whist
fection called especial attention to this fact, citing it as proof
positive In establishing the scientific status of the game.
At 6:S0 o'clock the players were seated, and at .10:30 the
cards .were gathered up and the scorers began to add up the
players' points. While th5$ Important work was going on
there was music and some dancing. Not many of the play
ers, however, felt Inclined for the fascinating waltz, but hung
around admiring the handsome prizes and waiting for the
awards to be announced. As the names of the prize-winners
Â¦were called off from the stage there was applause and haarty
greetings- for those who played so nobly and so well.
George -E. Bates distributed the prizes and managed the
tames. He was assisted in his arduous" duties by Henry
Payot, John Hanify, Philip Blankenship and J. H. Harbour.
The ladies on the reception committee were:

ALL on account of the great whist and euchre games
played out at the Palace Hotel last evening, there is
a rift in the usually harmonious atmosphere of the
California Club. It is nothing very serious and cer
tainly not beyond the possibility of being patched up.
Still it has caused no end of controversy and entertaining: gos
"slp among the club members.. Â¦ ,
The trouble began to brew just three weeks ago, when the
ladles-, of > the whist section decided to give a great whist and
euchre tournament for the benefit of ; the- club. Immediately
upon the announcement being made a : large number of. -club
members discovered that they were personally, opposed to card
playing and that It, was not proper to lend the name of the'
California Club in support of a card'game.'cven a benefit one.
A board meeting, : however, finally settled the matter, so It
was thought, and the. .whist section set out with right good will
to raise $1000.
There is an unwritten law in the California Club which de
crees that when the board decides in a matter, all members,
no matter what their personal opinion, must accept the de
cision. Therefore, like all good club members, the ladies
of the dissenting vote .took their grievance, home and spoke no
more of ft within the sacred club precinct. â¢â¢ .'
Then all went smoothly -and quietly until a â¢week ago, when
the club women discovered another thing, that the ladles of thÂ©
whist-, section . were soliciting prizes for the great game: And
oh what a terrible howl went up! Soliciting donations of any
kind was decided to be in direct violation of. the constitution
of the California Club, and Mrs. E.. P. Schell.' chairman of the
tournament committee, was summoned before the board to
explain matters. ; But there 'was little explanation to^make,
other than that the lady and her assistants were doing splen
did work and that.they, were confident -the game was going to
te a great success. As for the soliciting of donations. It was
too late to speak, still-less *tg i act, for the donations were all
In. And so the matter Was, perforce, dropped.
Mrs. Schell when asked to -discuss the rift her section had
caused in the club circle declared it was all bosh and non
sense and that everybody was satisfied.
. "Of course," said Mrs. Schell, "some.of tho club members
were opposed to a card game. Some women" do not' approve
of cards. But when the board decided it was right that we
should have , it. "that put an end to the matter. As for the
soliciting. of donations, we consider it perfectly right and
proper. The California* Club Â¦ has done , much for the public
and it is only fair in return that the public assist the Cali
fornia Club."
All the whist section was present at the great game last
evening. However,- many club members were absent, but then
the night was damp and dlsagTeable and that might account
for much. â¢
The grand Mardl Gras carnival of joy
will take place at the Mark Hopkins In
stitute to-night, and from present indica
tions this annual event will be a more
brilliant success this year than on 'any
previous occasion. Tickets have been sold
in . large numbers and the attendance Is
expected to tax the capacity of the build
ing.
Guests are expected to arrive after 8
o'clock and the grand march will- start
promptly at 9. Arrangements were made
yesterday, in consideration for those-vis
itors that attend from Oakland, to enabl..
them to catch a late boat, home. without
missing the feast that is expected to con
tribute no small share of the evening's
enjoyment. With this end in view orders
were given that those who so desire can
have their supper served at 11 o'clock.
This will give the people ample time who
live across the bay to partake of refresh
ments before leaving for their homes. Â¦
Everybody will unmask at midnight and
all will then adjourn to the supper tables.
Handsome menu cards. have been printed
in gay colors and-it. is. expected, that they
will be much in demand for souvenirs. .
The electric Illumination - scheme was
tested last evening and found: to work
â¢without a hitch. When the lights were
turned on they i presented a beautiful ap
pearance, showing every conceivable color
and shedding a soft and mellow light on
the scene. .. . Â¦ *
There will be no restriction In regard to
the'hour of closing the festivities, .and 'it
is expected that it will be nearly, .daylight
before the gay throng has departed for
home. , " -â¢ ,'Â¦ 'â¢ f
Director Fletcher of the Mardl Gras car
nival last evening that every detail
had been accomplished to make the affair
a great success; that a large number ot
tickets had been sold, and that only one
box was still, undisposed of. He expects
to sell this one before " the ' orchestra
strikes up the grand march this evening;

WHILE the Christian farmers
were "offering, up prayers of
thanksgiving as the clouds
dropped their watery store
yesterday there were 20.000
heathen lips muttering .imprecations on
the God of Storm. The population, of
Chinatown, decked in gorgeous raiments
and new slippers, had prepared to cele
brate the new year that had Just dawned.
All the. luster of the first day of festivi
ties was washed off and the elements gave
the Celestials naught but disappointment
and gloom. It was visitors' day, but few
could venture - on the streets. Those
who did found .their dainty garments as
sailed by the rain and their way impeded
by pools of mud and water.
Last year it was the polled that brought
sorrow" instead of joy. to the hearts of the
Mongolians at atime set apart for glad
ness. Because the highbinders had been
naughty and killed a man or two restric
tions calculated to make them remorse
ful and repentant were placed upon them.
The use of fireworks, always necessary
for the success of any undertaking,* be

PRINCE CARNIVAL
AT CITY'S GATE
Shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ing a 3 special rolled Into Oakland mole
carrying the three men who were Injured
in the wreck of the eastbound overland
train near Mill City, Nev., farly Sunday
morning. George Abbey, the engineer of
the -ill-fated .train, and James C' Cavin,
a. mail clerk, were brought to this city,
but Charles A.Schuyler, the. other in
jured mail clerk, was taken to his home,
1562 Market street, Â¦ Oakland. Abbey's
home Is in Wads worth, Nev. His wife and
daughter came down with him. .
'In the afternoon about 4 o'clock tho
bodies of Mr. and-*Mrs. Adolph Bissinger
reached San Francisco in charge of James
Schartzschleld of Reno, who has been
employed by Bissinger as a buyer for sev
eral years, and who left for the scene of
the accident the moment -he heard that
his employer was among the victims.
..A few hours before the accident, Bls
singer wrote two letters. It is presumed
by .his Â¦ relatives that they were to his
children. The arrival through the mails of
"tho messages from the dead," as the
missives are now called, is being anxious
ly awaited. The letters were'- posted
somewhere along the road.
Miss Elsie Bissinger, the 16-year-old
daughter of Mr. Bissinger, who was on
the train at the time of the accident, ar
rived-yesterday morning on the- train
bearing the wounded. She received only
slight bruises, but is suffering from the
terrible shock that she sustained. She
no doubt owes her life to the fact that,
when she was retiring on the night before
the accident she reiused to' sleep with
her head to the engine. Calling the por
ter of the car she ordered him to reverse
the pillows and bedding in the drawing
room and she slept witn her feet toward
the locomotive. When the crash came
she was stunned for a period and pinioned
in her bed by. broken timber. Sne tried
to release herself. The lights were out
and the gas was escaping, rendering the
air stifling. â¢ â¢
'Iwo men passed the car and the suffer
ing'girl appealed to them for assistance,
but they were bent on saving themselves
and heeded not her cries. These two
men did not see where they were going
and fell into the water below.
- Miss Bissinger at last, with a supreme
effort, released herself and crawled along
the aisle of the damaged car into the next
compartment. Blankets . were thrown
around her and she was made as com
fortable as possible. Although almost
broken down with grief at the loss of her
parents, Miss Bissinger refused to remain
quiet, and, with the assistance of others
in the train, tore up the sheets of the
Pullman sleeper and assisted the wound
ed by binding up their Injuries. Those
who were on the train say the girl dis
played great heroism.
The bodies of Adolph Bissinger and his
wife were removed to their late residence,
1918 Jackson street. The double funeral
will take place to-morrow morning, the
interment to be in San Mateo.
The remains of Clinton R. Coulter also
arrived on the afternoon Â¦ jtrain. They
were taken to his late residence, 133J
Pago street- His young wife is pros
trated from the terrible bereavement. No
arrangement have yet been made in ref
erence to Coulter's funeral.
/ J. C; Cavin, the injured mall clerk,
was convoyed to his home. 1030 Valencia
street.' Cavin has several severe, cuts
about his head and his body is badly
bruised. -His head being bandaged, he
can talk tmly with great difficulty, and
yesterday afternoon he had not fully re
covered from the shock, so was unable
to give a detailed account â¢ of the acci
dent. How severely he is hurt is not yet
known, but late last night the Injured
man was resting easily. This Is Cavin's
second Â¦ railroad I accident on an east
bound overland in Nevade. ' About ten
years ago he was in an accident near
the same spot, and then fortunately es
caped "with two broken ribs.
George Abbey, the engineer of the
train, was taken to the Railroad Hos
pital. He received several burns from
escaping steam and had his right foot
crushed. As is usual with the railroad
company in all such cases, the moment
that Abbey was insldo the hospital walls
he was placed in a private room, and
word was' ' given "out by the hospital
attaches that he was too sick to see any
of the members of the press and had
expressed a desire not to be disturbed.
Master of Transportation Richardson
stated yesterday afternoon that, a tem
porary track was being laid around the
spot where the accident had occurred,
ami that all overlands would be able to
pass over It by" midnigh't.
MISS BISSrNGEH'S EXPERIENCE.
One of the I Wreck Victims Tells of
Her Escape From Death.
OAKLAND, Feb. 18.-Miss Elsie Bis
singer, Â¦ when she stepped off the train
that brought her from Nevada, was sup
ported on' either side by Mr. and Mrs.
Greenebaum of the Hotel Richelieu, who
had gone up the road to meet the be
reaved young woman. * Having lost, all
her personal effects and- clothing, Â¦ Miss
Bissinger was compelled to appear in
apparel loaned her by friends. She was
taken to her appartment3 in the Hotel
Richelieu.
"It seemed that but a few minutes be
fore the "crash camo - 1 \ was enjoying 1 a
conversation ..with my relatives and fel
low passengers." said Miss . *Bissinser.
"but, of course. It was hours after I
retired when the. accident occurred.
Â¦ "I was" awakened suddenly by a vio
lent >concussion. It was pitch dark: I
could not see a thing. I knew that some
thing dreadful had occurred. There wa3
something ominous about the surround
ings. ; The first thing â¢ I thought of was
my. father and mother. - They < had oc
cupied the 'Â¦Â¦ berth just beneath me; Not
a sound came from them, and then a
horrible sensation came over- me. I
knew they must be dead. "
"Aftefthls feeling: had passed away in
a measure I thought of saving myself.
Butwhen I tiled to" draw my limbs up I
found I could not do so. ' They were pin
ioned under a portion of the debris. ; I, lay
there for some moments, : with : increasing
terror. Then, strangely enough, I was
suddenly released. I- think it, must have
beenthe se.ttlins.of the car into its final
resting .place that toÂ»k the pressure off
my limbs. â¢
VAfter.findlnR myself free I started to
crawl, out of the. car. It was some mo
ments before I- could '.; find 'an -opening.
Finally, one presented itself In 'a place
where. the roof of, the car had been torn
off. I succeeded, in gettinpr , through it
without much 'difficulty. : The people In
thÂ© other." cars t hen â¢ took care of , me and
I was made as comfortable as possible. â¢;.
"I am sure I would have met | the same
fate-as my father and mother but for one
thing. Â¦ When : I retired ; 1 -s rested \ with my
head in the opposite direction from that in
Â¦which the- frain was moving. ; It .seems
that .it Is "customary: to -sleeps with the
heart In'the same direction as the train is
going. . ' My relatives : slept ' that way. po
that .when the concussion', came ' Â¦ their
heads were .dashed' against the berth
stanchions. Â¦y^M^aw>^B3toi*WjaMiWjBwM|
"The scene after the accident v/ag awful
Thft cars were piled. upon one another and 1
everywhere r t hero were â¢ !arÂ«re Â¦- masses i of
debris.' "I -eoulcl not bear, to :lnok upon the
bodies i of the dead," of which 'I thought
there mierht have been a greatmany more
