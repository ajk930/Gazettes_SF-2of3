not. known until to-day that Croker had
so far humbled himself as to seek, terms
from the Vicar of the Pro-Cathedral. The

whereof he speaks. An emissary was sent
from the Democratic Club to Rev. Mr.
Paddock, who was assured that Croker
admired his force of character and was
willing, to 'assist- him: in his work; among
the East Side poor.' That they might
have an opportunity to discuss, tho matter
privately, Croker invited h!s "youn:?

FAVORABLE DECISION
EXPECTED IN PORTO RICO
AHD PHILIPPINE CASES
CAL.L. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.
Friends of the administration think
they see an incident of a favorable
decision from the Supreme Court
In the Porto Rico and Philippine
cases in this quotation from the
decision of the court rendered to
day in the Neely case:
"Apart from view that it is
not competent for the judiciary to
make any declaration upon, the
question of the length of time dur
ing which Cuba may be rightfully
occupied and' -controlled by, the
United States in order to effect its
pacification, it being Ithe function
of the political branch of the Gov
ernment to determine when such
occupation and control shall erase,
and therefore the claim that the
troops of the United States recog
nized the existence i'of an estab
lished government known as j the
republic of Cuba.Jbut^s now using
lls*mnitary -oif*^xÂ«?cutive' pfewÂ«-T^tu
displace or overthrow- it, is^ with
out merit."
It is reasoned that if the Su
preme Court considers the leng^
of time of occupation of Cuba may
be continued in order to effect its
pacification, a political question
with which the court has nothing
to do, the question of the length of
time the military occupation of the
Philippines can continue will also
be considered a political one, and
that It can continue Indefinitely as
far as the Supreme Court Is con
cerned.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.-The United
States Supreme Court to-day announced
Its'declsion in the case of C. W. F. Neely,
charged with embezzlement of the public
funds of Cuba while acting as financial
agent of the department of posts of that
Island, holding that Neely is subject to
extradition. ' ,
Justice Harlan handed down the court's
decision, which .was unanimous, and im
mediately after the decision was rendered
an order, was issued requiring that the
mandate In tho case be Issued. at once.
Entering then upon his reasoning in the
case, Justice Harlan said that there was
no dispute that on the 6th of June. 1900,
when the act under which this proceed
ing is brought became a law. Cuba was
"under the control of the United States"
and "occupied by this Government."
"The court,", he said, "will take judicial'
notice that such were at the date named
and are now the relations between this
country and Cuba. So that the applica
bility of .the above act to the present case
âand this is the first question to be ex
aminedâ depends upon the inquiry wheth
er, within Its meanine. Cuba Is .to be
deemed a foreign country. or territory. >
"We do not think this question 1 at all
difficult of solution if regard be had to
the avowed objects Intended to be accom
plished by the -war with Spain ' and by
the military occupation of that island.?
Announcing the ' court's ' conclusion on
the status of Cuba, Justice Harlan said:
"The facts above detailed make it clear
that Cuba is foreign territory within the
meaning of the act of June 6. 1900. ' It can
not be regarded in any constitutional, le
gal or international; sense apart of the
territory of the United States. While by
the act of April 25/ 1898, war was declared
between this V country ' and Spain, the
President was directed and empowered to
use our entire land and. naval forces, ; as
well as the militia of the several ' States,
to such extent as, was, necessary to carry
the act into effect, that authorization was
not ; . for ' the - purpose â¢ of making : Cuba an
integral part of the United [ States; Â¦ but
the purpose; only of compelling the reiin
quishment"; by s Spain of its and
the withdrawal of its 'forces , from- Cuba
and Cuban '.waters. The ; legislative, and
executive branches of the Government, oy
the Joint resolution of April 20, 1898, ex
pressly^disclaimed any purpose to exer- :
cise sovereignty, jurisdiction or .control
over ' Cuba, '. 'except . for ; the pacification
thereof,' and. asserts the 'determination of

Dr. Howard has no plans for the immediate future, except
that he will finish a book upon which he has beon engaged for

work will be entitled "A History of Matrimoniannstitutions,

President David S. Jordan. Stanford University, Cal.â Dear Sir: Your
letter accepting my resignation is received. Of course I am well aware
that the rights of the large number of students now registered In my
classes are involved in fixing the time of my resignation. Therefore,
since I am being dismissed from a life position on. the 'alleged ground
at discourtesy to the authorities of the university. It neemad to me
but fair that you should take the responsibility of saying whether I
should remain to thÂ« end of the year. You decline to take, that re
sponsibility, and so leave me but one safe and dignified course.
I should have been willing to remain to the. close of the year for
the sake of my students, could I have felt sure that by "harmonious
co-operation" you mean a faithful and free performance of academic
duty according to the spirit of the original Implied contract under
which I have thus far labored. I have not changed J my attitude
toward the university or toward my professorial duties. I am. only
protesting against revolutionary proceedings. The vital point of the
whole present incident is a question of free speech. Therefore ; 1^ am
not willing to pledfre myself . in advance to abide by the uncertain

GEORGE E. HOWARD.
Professor George Elliott Howard is one of the most gifted'
historians in America. He graduated from the University of
Nebraska in 1S76, took his A. M. in 1879 and his Ph.D. in 1S94.
He was a student in history and jurisprudence at the universi
ties of Munich and Paris from 1876. to. 1878. From 1879 to 1891 he
was professor of history in the University of Nebraska. He
also acted as secretary of the Nebraska State Historical Soci
ety from 1SS5 to 1891.
When Stanford University -opened Dr. Howard was the
first man chosen for a position on the faculty of the new in
stitution by President Jordan. Among his students Dr. How
ard Is looked to as an Inspiring leader In intellectual pursuits.
President Jordan, speaking of his work to a Stanford graduate,
said: "We have many good teachers at Stanford, but Dr. How- \
ard comes the nearest to being- a really great teacher. He is
in many respects an ideal teacher."
Professor Howard has been at Stanford ever since the doors
of the university were thrown open. During this time he has
given his best thought and work to the Institution, with the
result that his department ha3 made Stanford famous. So
far has his judgment been trusted that ho was allowed to draw
the plans for the new building which is being erected for the
use of the departments of history, English and economics. He
it was who had planned the academy of history, economics and
sociology for graduate work which would occupy the Stanford
residence in San Francisco.

Nothing was said of the matter to Professor Howard by
President Jordan till the opening of the present semester, when
the following correspondence, which fully explains the position
if both parties, took place:
LELAKD STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY.
Office- of the. President.
"I do not bow down to Saint Market Street. I
do not doff my hat to the Six Companies. Neither am I
afraid of the Eoly Standard Oil." , â¢
He said that Professor Ross was a martyr to a principle
which cannot be sacrificed and that his forced retirement would
work immeasurable evil to the university. He declared that in
the retirement of Professor Ross a serious blow had been
etruck at the frectlom of speech and the consequences must be
as far-reaching as they were deplorable. In conclusion he ut
tered these notabl? words, which are supposed to have been
the most objectionable to the university authorities:
At the time the address was given It created a profound
sensation and was the subject of much comment outside of
college circles as well as within. The impassioned outburst
Â¦was before Dr. Howard's class In "French Revolution." Stu
dents that heard him will long remember how intensely sin
cere their impassioned professor was that morning. He opened
his address by declaring that he could not confine himself to
Voltaire and the Intellectual bondage of the past century when
the present vime presented an incident of bigotry and intoler
ence equally as flagrant.
The causes leading up to Dr. Howards enforced res
ignation are wholly an outgrowth of the dismissal of Dr. E. A.
Ross from the department of sociology last November. Dr.
Howard was one of the most outspoken of several of the Stan
ford faculty who regarded Mrs. Stanford's interference as a
blow at freedom of speech and academic liberty. On Novem
ber 15. the day after Dr. Ross' resignation had been accepted.
Dr. Howard delivered the address which aroused President
Jordan to call for either his apology or resignation. Professor
Howard was a close personal friend of Dr. Ross and^ shared
something of the same independence and intellectual freedom
which characterized the distinguished economist.

powers relative to the dispatch recently
forwarded through our diplomatic repre
sentatives abroad urgently requesting
that negotiations be expedited as fast as
possible. All ; the powers concur in this
view and express an earnest ( desire to
reach a final settlement. It is rather a
singular and unaccountable fact, however,
that some of the foreign powers have re
.ferred; to delays caused by the United
States, whereas the efforts of this Gov
ernment, throughout have been to hurry
matters along." It was for this reason that
the, recent proposition - was made to re
move the two points of Indemnity and
treaties to Washington or some other cap
ital, although some of the powers seem to
have the erroneous impression that this
delayed proceedings. The State Depart
ment adheres *.o the purpose not to make
known the powers who favored or opposed
the recent proposition. But In view of re
ports to the effect that Great Britain was
most .strenuous In opposition It can be
stated that the Brllsh Government was
one. of those, which received the sugges
tion most favorably.

which Â¦ has been fought out once' be
fore in - .the Legislature and â¢ which
will : bring another fioht this session.
The report will ,coine before' the
Legislature in. the form of: bills' em
bodying the recommendations., made' by
the commission. ; Among them is one that
chaiflfcs the law relating to contempt
committed outside of the presence of the
court so as to allow an appeal from a
Judgment In contempt. Under the present
law there is ho appeal, but the judgment
in contempt may be reviewed by the high
er court upon a writ of certiorari, which,
however, runs only as to the jurisdiction
of the lower court. The difference be
tween the writ and the appeal Is that the
writ is a quick remedy, the appeal a slow
one, and that in the case of an appeal
the party enjoined may put up a bond
and continue the work he is supposed to
have stopped.
This matter, of appeal in contempt pro
ceedings was brought up in a report of
a Code Commission four years ago, the
source of It being a faction of the hy
draulic miners. The hydraulickers under
the. law were v enjoined from hydraulic
mining excepr under certain conditions,
on the ground that their work was dam
aging the farms and rivers below them.
It was pointed out at the time that if
they were allowed to appeal from Judg
ments in contempt and the then existing
conditions they could tie up a Judgment
..for two or three years before the higher
court, and in the meantime continue to
work their mines in defiance of the in
junction and the fubsequent contempt
proceedings. .
When the proposition to change appeals
first came up before the Legislature there
was a storm of protest from the valley
men, who saw in It an. attempt to work
the hydraulic mines despite the legal pro
hibition. , There was not then nor has
there been since any" Indorsement of such
a proposition from the Miners' Associa
tion, for it is the rule of that organiza
tion not to countenance any but legal
mining-. The proposition was killed and
it has lain dormant, until now It appears
again in one of the three voluminous bills
which are based on the report of the Code
Commission. â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦
The opponents of the , clause declare
that, without going Into the matter, an
amendment to the code providing appeals
in contempt cases Is new legislation, and
is in no .way within the province of the
Code Commission. It is claimed that the
Code Â¦ Commission can go no further than
a revision of the codes, and that it can
not add anything new to them. The pro
vision is. deemed a bad one, and several
Senators have announced their determina
tion, to vote. against all three bills on the
venture that 4 if the appeal In contempt
has been brought In- there must be much
that is objectionable. . .

The Speaker passed - by the Alameda
County delegation in Â¦ his selections,
though every .one supposed that the
county In which the university Is situated
would be accorded representation on the
committee. McWade and Kelley of Ala
meda were both Pendleton men, and Me-
WadÂ© is an alumnus of the University or
California. That neither ot them was ap
pointed is attributed to the fact that they
win support the bills which, presumably,
the Governor opposes. Anderson, who has
charge of the University of California,
bills in the Assembly, and Wright, who
introduced tho Stanford bills, were also
passed by in making up the committee.

tion of teachers. It Is Intended by tna
bill to be Introduced to abolish primary
certificates and .have instead elementary
certi Hcatfes. It was agreed upon between
the State Teachers' Association and the
State Educational Commission that thÂ»
provisions providing the change* should be
so harmonized as to make them effective
In San Francisco without endangering the
validity of certificates there or interfer
ing to any great extent with existing con
ditions. It was promised that this woula
be done, yet when the bill was ready for
presentation to-day there were no such
words as "San Francisco" In it. Further
proceedings were stopped at once by a
vigorous "kick," and the bill haa been
hung up until the amendments suggested
can De incorporated. It Is claimed that if
the State law be changed and no provision
made to harmonize the San Francisco
laws the laws will be In the nature of
special legislation and the validity of all
certificates of that county would thereby
be endangered. ; Â¦
The provisions which It Is intended shall
be harmonized to allow their benefit to
reach San Francisco will make certifi
cates Interchangeable throughout the
State, and will provide for the preserva
tion of those primary certificates that ara
already in existence.
A 1 second point of importance will be in
cluded In the bill to allay the uncertainty
now attaching to the validity of life di
plomas. It will provide that after six
yeani of service a teacher may be granted
a permanent certificate, which, so far a3
the county Issuing It is concerned, will be
a life diploma.
There will be a. meeting of the teachers
committee in San Francisco on Wednes

It will be observed from an examination of

rxrvision over the act* of said commission,
ted the State Controller has informed me that
r.o vouchers fcave as yet l>een returned to said
officer. HENRY T. GAGE,
Governor of the titaie of California,
The Governor's attitude on the question
has been the subject of much speculation,
as It was recognized by all that if he de
sired no investigation or a perfunctory
one with â¬ whitewash at the end, his wish
would be gratified, as his partisans are in
a majority on the committee. But, as was
predicted In The Call, the restriction by
the Legislature of the Governor's power
over the commission prompted hfm to
"pass the buck" to the legislative branch
by practically forcing it into an investiga
tion of the commission's failure to fulfill
its prescribed duty In the ' matter t>t
vouchers.
This failure to present vouchers and the
inadequacy of the commission's report,
accompanying the message, when It Is re
membered that the commission has pre
sented nothing else to show for its hand
ling of a fund of $130,000, make rigid in
vestigation certain, fipeaker Pendleton
promptly referred fhe message to the

ment at noon consulted with members of
the committee regarding an early meeting.
State Controller E. P. Colgan declares
he ha*- no power over the fund appro
priated for the California Commission to
the Paris Exposition, and that in handling
the money he followed the precedent set
by the ruling In the case of the Chicago
World's Fair appropriation. The Control
ler took the ground that the appropriation
for the Chicago Fair Commission was il
legal and he refused to draw a warrant
for it. but the Supreme Court, on appeal
decided in favor of the Commissioners.
"I have followed this ruling," said
Mr. Colg-an this evening. "ThÂ« Su
preme Court ordered it and I drew
the warrant at once, as the money
was to bÂ« spent outside of the State,
Â¦wraiting until the commission had
made up its accounts to receive the
vouchers. I did the same in the case
of the Hamburg appropriation and
again in the case of this Paris Com

returning an exhibit of the products of fhe
Htate or California at the Paris Exposition In
l**i. Also /or preparing and printing literature
fnr distribution at said exposition and provid
ing a commission and expense of commission
and attaches. (Approved March 20, 1S99.)
Carrying out of the provisions of said act It
was >our pK-asure to nam* as such Commission
ers E. W. Runyon of Red Bluff. W: W. Foote of
Oakland and Major Ben C. Truman of Los An-
Reles. Immediately upon receipt of their com
misFlons thes<e gentlemen proceeded to organize
l>y the election of E. W. Runyon as president,
and elected Varney W. GasklU as their secre
tary. |
The exhibits of this State were collected with
the utmost care; were duly forwarded and
handsomely installed In five "different depart
ments and pavilions at the Paris Exposition,
namely: Horticulture. . agriculture, mining,
forestry and fishery: these being the five groups Â¦
in which the California commission principally
exerted all their energies.
This Ftate was allotted six Jurors, one for
fach of these departments, and the different
irroups were divided into 1O.> different classes,
of which California had a *i>lend!ri representa
tion In twenty-four of them. This Ftate had
mi -elegant display, consisting of a full line of
all varieties of dried, canned, conserved, freah
end citrus fruits, raletns, nuts, wines, olive
oils, cereals, wool, woods, leather, perfumery,
mapsi education, social economy and varied In
dustries.
The following summary of awards speaks for
itself: Out of a total of 577 exhibitors from this
State. &6K received awards at the. hands of the
international Jury. Thus it will be seen that
of all our exhibitors 98 per cent recelvei
awards, while only 60 per cent of the world's
exhibitors received any mention. Including
these awards the State of California secured a
crand prize for Its collective exhibits in each
of the five departments stove mentioned, and
five additional gold medals on separate exhib
its in these and other departments. California
exhibits were distributed in the different de
partments and grouped with similar exhibits
of the world. Attractive signs were placed con
rplcuously over California exhibits directing the
visitors to our State display, which had been
artistically arranged, and the name of Cali
fornia soon became a household word.
Another feature of the Commissioners' work
and which brought great prominence to the
fctate was the â¢ headquarters bureau . of in
formation, collective exhibits and offices, main
tained at R Place de l'Opera. the very center
of the most populous quarter of Paris, which
rirew thousands of visitors of nil nationalities
peeking information of the resources of our
ftate. It can be stated this was the only State
in the Union that maintained such headquarters
outside of the exposition.
An efficient corps of assistants familiar with
the resources of our great State and conversant
with tho French. German, Spanish and Italian
languages were always on hand at these head
quarters to furnish any Information required,
also to assist Callforniana in and about Paris;
also to furnish them with data as to where our
exhibits at the exposition could be found and
give them all information while In Paris.
There wu also maintained a commercial bu
reau, whose function It was to distribute
throughout Europe albums and maps printed
in French, English and German. Illustrative of
< the resources of this State. It is pleasing to
note in this connection that over 300 answers
were received from Boards of Trade and Cham
bers of Commerce acknowledging receipt of
these maps and albums, and thanking the com
mission for their courtesy in the matter and
also assuring the commission that the map*
would be prominently displayed on their walls.
The commission has fully demonstrated that
many products of this State are now In. the
markets of France and that by further enter
prise of our producers many others can be suc
cessfully and profitably sold there.
Of the $130,000 appropriated by our Legisla
ture, which was turned over to the commission,
about $116,000 will have been expended when
this commission shall have finished their, work,
thus leaving a balance of about $14,000 to be
turned bark to the State treasury. The com
mteshm will render a full and complete report
of all' its proceedings from the organization to
the closing of Its affairs, so that the people of
this State may have a full report of how the
money was expended and the affairs managed.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

PARIS COMMISSION INQUIRY NOW SEEMS ASSURED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.â The inaugura
tion of a President could not have
brought a larger crowd to the As
sembly chamber this afternoon
than the one which gathered there to see
the vote "of the State Electors cast for
William McKinley and Theodore Roose
velt for President and Vice President of
the Unltea States. It was a new thing to
make of the simple act a public and im
pressive ceremony, but there was no doubt
of the success of the experiment nor of
the lasting impression which it'made.
Flags were draped around the galleries
and above and behind the.Speaker's desk.
Palms and evergreens were clustered be
low the flags, around the gallery rails and
along the walls, and from the central
chandelier hung pennants of the national
colors, moving gracefully over the throng
that filled every seat and every corner ot
the big room. ..â¢ â¢ . . .
At the. hour set the. crowd around -the
entrance was parted, and, led by the Gov- ;
ernor, the official? who were to take. part
in the programme entered, the audience
cheering the executive as he made his
way up the aisle. Following him were
Colonel George Stone, chairman of the
Republican State Central . Committee;
Jacob H. Neff.' Lieutenant Governor, of
the State; Thomas Flint Jr. President
pro tem. of the Senate, and C.- W. Pen
dleton. Speaker of the Assembly. They
took their places behind the Speaker's
desk. Secretary of Statp Charles F. Curry
followed, and then came the nine Electors,
who took seats at the clerk's desk. Col
onel Stone rapped for order, opened the
ceremonies with a brief speech and then
introduced Governor Gage, who spoke as
follows:
Mr. Chairman, Blectors, Ladles and Gentle
men: The people of the great State of Cali
fornia cast their vote on the 6th day of last
November by no uncertain majority for two
distlDtruished citizens for President, and Vice
President. While they voted Indirectly for the
men whom thpy wished to occupy those high
offices, it becomes your duty," electors, to carry
out the will of the people who elected you by
a direct vote for William McKinley, for Presi
dent, and Theodore Roosevelt, for Vice Presi
dent, n .
It is pleasant to recalVthe historical fact
that while the framers or the constitution
feared to give the people the power to Bay
directly who should fill the higheet offices ot
the nation, no electors since, perhaps, 1S04
have gone contrary to the wish of the' people
in casting their ballots. The constitution does
not bind you to vote except as your own Â¦wish
may dictate, but custom- has decreed that the
will of the people shall be respected and your
ballots to-day will doubtless be. cast as the
will of the people expressed at the polls de
mands. â¢ .

Third, a report signed by Moody, which

Fifth, a report signed by Fleming. In

WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.-The Postal
Commission of the House and Senate,
which has been investigating postal mat

port to-day. The commission reports in
favor of excluding from the second class
mail rate â first, books, whether bound or
unbound; second, newspapers and periodi
cals unsealed sent by a news agent to an
other news agent or returned to the pub
lisher; third, sample copies of newspapers
above a certain small fixed proportion of
the circulation. The commission also
unanimously reports against the continu
ance of the service of transmitting mails
In pneumatic tubes under present â¢con
ditions. The commission unanimously re
ports that neither a change in letter post
age nor the establishment of a system
of parcels post is practicable under exist
ing cond'*'ons of revenue and expendi
ture, eve. '* otherwise desirable, upon
which no opinion is expressed.
Upon the question of railway mall pay
there are five reports: First, a report
signed by Senators Wolcott and Allison,
which declares that the present rate of
railway mall pay Is not excessive and
ought not to be changed, except by the
discontinuance of the appropriations for
special facilities, which It declares should
be discontinued.

choice of her own place of worship ar.d
her own home for the scene of the mar

which would have been found in New

noon, an hour or more before that time

the church and those who came about 11
o'clock had the pleasure of listening to
an organ concert and found leisure to
marvel at the floral decorations. Pink,
green and white in many charming com
binations were the prevailing colors, the
distinctive flowers being the Glolre de ia
Reine begonias, the Golden Gate roses
with white azaleas and the specimen
palms.
The center aisle was a lane of begonias
and asparagus, standards eight feet high
being trimmed with the feathery foliage
cf the latter at regular intervals from the
entrance to the chancel. Baskets of deli
cate pink flowers depended from the
standards. Specimen palms thirty feet
high towered high above the altar. Inter
spersed among the foliage which banked
them were great clusters of white azaleas
and medallions of Golden Gate roses. On
the altar was an immense cross of As
cension lilies.

SAX JOSE, Jan. 14.â Mayor Martin has
Instituted a crusade against saloons that
women are allowed to frequent. This
caaif as a sensation to the City Council at
its meeting this morning, when his Honor
presented a message closing side entrances
to saloons. The move was brought about
by the assault upon and brutal treatment
leceived by Marie Staten at the hands of
three your.g roughs a few davs ago.
In hie message Mayor Martin says that
a woman was recently Induced to enter
a saloon, and was assaulted, beaten and
robbed, and in the wide publicity of the
fact the good name of San Jose for peace
end order has been called into question.
In the past few months he has noticed
considerable increase in these side doors
and ladies' entrances and their unmis
takable signs of invitation to the un
wary, and that the preservation of the
morals of the unsophisticated demands
their suppression.
The matter was referred to the Ordin
ance Committee.
The police, under the direction of Chief
Kidwartl. are arresting all dissolute char
acters Uith the hope of freeing the town
of touts, "fiends" and degraded women.
Twenty-five warrants were sworn to to
day charging various persons with va
grancy, and about sixty more will be is-
Fued to-morrow. As soon as the culprits
are arrested they are taken into court
where they are given a chance to either
leave Mwn or i>e prosecuted. All agree to
leave. In this way it is hoped to free the
c:ty of /his undesirable class.

PARIS, Jan. 14.â In the Chamber of Dep
uties to-day the Government was Inter
pellated by Marcel Zambat. Radical So
cialist, on the "interference of the Pope
in the domestic affairs of France," as
shown in the recent letter of the Pope to
Cardinal Richard, the Archbishop of
Paris, deallnsr with the proposed bill of
the Premier, 34. "Waideck-Kousseau,
known as the law of associations, and
aiming; at the suppression of religious
communities, in whicn the Pontiff detend
Â«d the religious orders. M. Za-mbat asked
the Government to protest against this
letter.
AL Ribot, the former Premier, defended
the Pope, mho, he said, was entitled to
raise his voice when h.e thought religious
Interests were in Deril.
The statement called forth cheers from
the liightists and Centrists.
The entire session was spent in discuss
ing the interpellation of St. Zambat, the
debate closing with a declaration by M.
\Valdeck-Roussea.u. who said the Govern
ment saw no threat in the Pope's letter
as to the missions in the East.
"The letter of his Holiness." said the
Premier, "simply said if the French mis
sionaries disappeared they would be re-
Viaced by foreign missionaries.
"The Government will not tolerate the
organization of resistance apanist the
laws of the country. No Interference on
the part of the Pope will be allowed in the
law of associations when it is voted upon.
The Pope has rights as the spiritual bead
of Catholics, but the state also has rights
written In the concordat, which it will see
respected."
This declaration rallied around the Gov
ernment all the Leftists and Centrists,
who voted a poll of the Premier's declara
tions by 4Â£9 to 95, and confidence In his
firmness to assure the defense of the
ricrhts of the state.
The Chamber then adopted a resolution
embodying both paragraphs.
Other extremist motions, one proposing
the separation of church and state and
enother proposing to denounce the con
cordat, were rejected by overwhelming
majorities.
The Chamber was crowded with Deputies
end notable visitors !n the expectation
that the debate on the law of associations
would be begim. To-day's resolution has
greatly elated the Ministerialists, who de
clare that it presages victory for the law
cf associations.

He said that If the prejudices of the

would offer a great market for California

vBaid Mr. Filcher, that in France good
wines commanded as high a price as they

the vilest product imaginable. He dwelt
upon the good results of the exhibits of
California wines and fruits at Paris, and
said that markets were being found for

IN CONVEITION
"Captain Hall said: 'I am sorry,

1s a matter I cannot control' or words to
that effect. She then said. "They are loaf
ers.' 'No,' said Captain Hall, 'no one here

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N. W.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â A letter re
ceived here from a naval officer indicates
that Captain Hall, accused of cowardice
at Peking, is a victim of petticoat diplo
macy. Captain Hall was in command of
the marines from July 3, when Captain
Meyers was wounded, until the siege of
Peitlng ended.
"I believe the charges," said the naval
officer, "grew out or the fact that the
marines would not take on* their hats to
the. wife of the First Secretary. There
was much feeling on the part of non-com
missioned officers and privates against the
Kirst Secretary and his wife and Justly
in my opinion.
"It -seems that the Chinese steward of
Mr. Conger told our marines that thero
had been a row between Mrs. Conger antl
the wife of the First Secretary becau.se
Mrs. Conger wanted to send the marines
on the wall some of the canned goods
which the marines had themselves cap
tured and turned into the general store
in the British Legation. Mrs. First Sec
retary refused to send anything, and so,
according to the Chinese steward, the
ladies stopped speaking to one another.
"Our marines thus got the impression
that Mrs. Conger was their friend and
that the' wife of the First Secretary was
not, and the marines used to stand at at
tention when Mrs. Conger passed in at the
Legation gate, while they did not when
the First Secretary's wife entered.
"One day during the siege, as the wife
of the Secretary passed through the Lega
tion gate from the British Legation and
the marines did not stand at attention, she
took them to task, calling them 'bums
and tramps' and saying that they wero
not fit to be soldiers.
"Passing into the Legation grounds and
seeing Captain Hall asleep in a chair she"
awakened him by calling, 'Captain Hall,
your men do not salute me. They are
Boers.'

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Among the many famous cures of
Swamp-Root investigated by The Call,
none seem to speak higher of the wonder-
ful curative properties of this great kid-
ney remedy than the one we publish this
week for thÂ© benefit of our readers.
"You have no Idea how well I feel. I am sat-
isfied that I do not need any more medicine, as
I am In as good health as I ever was In my
life." So says Mrs. Mary Engelhardt. of 2S3S
Madison street, St. Louis, Mo., to a reporter of
the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
"For more than ten years I had Â«offered with
what the doctors termed female trouble: also
heart trouble, with swelling: of the feet and
limbs. Last summer I felt so badly that I
thought I had not long to lire. I consulted
doctor after doctor and took their medicines,
but felt no better. The physicians told mÂ« my
kidneys were not affected, but I felt sure that
they were the cause of my trouble. A friend
recommended me to try Dr. Kilmer** Swamp-
Root, and I must say I derived Immense benefit
almost from the first week. I continued the
medicine, taking: it regularly, and I am now in
splendid health. The pains and aches have all
pone. I have recommended Swamp-Root to
all my friends, and told them what It has done
for me. I will gladly answer any one who de-
sires to write me regarding my case. I most
heartily Indorse Swamp-Root from every stand-
point. There is such a pleasant taste to Swamp-
Koot, and It goes right to the weak spots and
drives them out of the system."

Jack Gleason Defeats "Billy" Ken-
BRILLIANT HANDBALL
PLAYED BY AMATEURS
nedy in a Sensational
Game.
Interest in the handball tournament now
on at the Olympic Club is on the increase.
The attendance at the games last night
was very large and the spectators waxed
enthusiastic over fierce rallies and clever
play*. The best exhibition of tha evenm*
was put up* by â¢â¢Billy" Kennedy ana
"Jack" Gleason. The latter won two
straight, but his victory did not come easy
to him. Neither Gleason nor Kennedy
have spoken to each other in a year anu
through the fortunes of the tournament
both were pitted together last night. Not
a word was uttered during the "rubber"
but both "sawed wood." Gleason was in
splendid form and he played "wrinkles'"
around Kennedy. Kennedy resorted to
the overhand "swipe," while Gleason us*>a
the underhand stroke to better advantage
Gleason "killed" the ball at every oppor
tunity and placed it with unerring aim
The first game went to Gleason by a score
Of 21-6. . :
In the second Kennedy forgot his sore
hands, wiped the fog off his glasses and
played harder. Two or three times the
score was "up-sticks" and neither player
could: gain an advantage. Gleason then
got back his winning serve and ran out
The game was a brilliant one and every
good play was generously applauded
Score:, Gleason 21, Kennedy 11.
The preceding games, .however, wero
one-sided. Henry Russ beat John Tate by
a score of 21-10: 21-11. George Littlefiel 1
defeated Tom Slevin 21-9: 21-6.
The losers will play to-morrow evening
M. Rosenfeld. and : R. . Bowman arV
matched;: John Tate ; plays "Bill" Ken
nedy; T. Slevin plays T. Kennedy, and
Thomas Walsh will play Ottie Crable.
â¢ Fred Butz,* Jack Gleason or W. Cart
wright are fancied by /the wise ones tf>
win the tournament. *

KILLS ROOFER
ATTRACTKD by a catrhy card of
f-vents, the Monday crowd at Oak
land met fairly good success in
picking winners. The track was
muddy, to be rure, but the mud
larks in most instances ran true to form,
and nearly all of the hooks quit behind on
the afternoon's pp^-oulatlng. Three of th<*
eix favorites landed purses and the other
j=ucce?=lul horses wore not neglected.
Before many more moons roll around it
will be Fer^rally admitted Ordnung is a
last one. The Schorr horse picked up 114
pounds in the fourth, a Fix-furlong purse
run. and with J. Miller In the paddle left
nothing but a trail of smoke behind him.
Frank Bell, which had been heavily
played, coitld not get within speaking dis
tance, and Gibraltar, the favorite. waB
fortunate to finish third. All conditions
seemed to favor the winner, even the
price, which was as good as 14 to 5.
Old Monrovia, now eleven years old,
captured the opening six-furlong selling
event In a drive, from Marcato. The last
named horse has not been out since hia
breakdown last season, but the spot
looked such a soft one that he was in
stalled favorite. Mounce rode the winner
which was quoted at 8 to 1 in the ring.
There was an extensive play on CasdaJe
whose chances were spoiled by a verv
poor ride.
Billy Magrane's Lomond turned up wln
n-V ot tne mIle and seventy yard run.
J he bay horse was backed down from 5 to
2 to 9 to 5 and Domlnick had him out in
front all the way.
Dunblane, with Mounce up, and the
opening favorite, interferred with Wallen
stein down near the eighth pole and after
some deliberation the judges gave the
place to the latter horse.
With a decidedly green bunch to handle
in the two-year-old number. Mr. Cald
well s start was very ragged. O'Connor
on the favorite, Sol Lichtenstein. got
away all right, and won easily from
Dorene, the fast filly from the Burns &
\\ aterhouse etable. Minerva, which broke
away first, took the show from Lapidus
a vest pocket edition of hia sire. Sta"'*
Ruby.
Gaylon Brown's old horse, Wyoming
annexed the purse for the mile selling
run, with 4}A to 1 obtainable in the ring!
\\ innie O Connor had the leg up, and tim
iner his move perfectly, caught Pat Moi
rissey near the paddock, scoring by a
length. Malay, which opened an even
money chance, finished sixth. Dr. Row
ell p horee has had a surfeit of racing re
cently and besides was never seen at his
best over a track inclined to be holding
T.rchin. a 25 to 1 shot, ran into the show,
well ridden by J. Miller.
Both Meehanus and Native were
scratched from the concluding six furlong
Felling affair. This left Prestidigitator
the most likely looking one. and the Cahill
entry came in a very easy winner from
IsaJine and Espirando.

"My lover's gone back on me, and I've
taken poison." H
With these words, addressed to her
brother, Florence Bell, a pretty girl of 18,
fell to the floor in the kitchen of Mrs.
Seres' milk ranch at Persia and Edin
burgh streets at 10 o'clock last night, and
died In a few minutes, having swallowed
carbolic acid.
The young woman seemed in her or
dinary mind to the occupants of the house
and no one had any idea that she would
seek her own life. Her brother, John Bell,
was standing in the kitchen when his sis
ter entered the room. She called to him,
and when he turned in response uttered
the above Â¦words, immediately afterward
falling to the floor.
Medical aid was summoned, but the girl
was beyond human aid. having swallowed
a large dose of caroolic acid. The vial
used was afterward found in her room.
The man to whom the girl referred in
her last words to her brother is connected
with the quartermaster's department at
the xresidio. A few days ago the girl,
who was deeply in love with him, learned
that he was a married man. â¢
Mrs. Seres, with whom the girl had been
living. for the last ten months, is her Bis
ter. Another sister, Mrs. W. Turner, lives
at 1017 Lombard, street, and a brother is
with the army In the Philippines. The
body was removed to the Morgue. Â¦

THE advance sale of seats for the
Root-Byers and Thurston-Cribb
fights, which are to be held at
Woodward's Pavilion on Friday
evening under the auspices of the
National Club, opened yesterday at 914
Mantet street, and the number of tickets
disposed of augurs well for the attend
ance.
That the men will enter the arena fit to
put up fast battles is evinced by the re
ports which come from their training
quarters. Jack Root of Chicago is pre
paring himself at Croll's Gardens. Ala
meda. and is already in fine fettle. His
opponent, George Byers of Boston, is
training with Charles Thurston at the
Ocean beach. Visitors to their quarters
come away favorably impressed with both
their chances of winning. Byers is said
to be very fast and extremely clever. He
Is possessed of a hard punch in either
hand and is full of confidence of beating
the clever Windy City boxer.
GIRL FALLS DEAD
AT BROTHER'S FEET
Alec Greggains, the local flght impre
sario, is so certain that Byers will win
that he has consented to go behind him
the night of the battle. Greggains is pay
ing clcse attention to his coming wonder,
"Dutch" Thurston. He boxes with the
"Flying Dutchman" every day and pro
tects his "dining apartment" with a pneu
matic pad, usually, worn by catchers in
the national game. Byers and Thurston
are down to weight and are well seasoned
for their coming fights.
Otto Crlbb, the Australian middle
weight, who is to battle Vlth Thurston, is
training at Blanken's. He assures his
friends that he will be in the ring fit to
go the route at any pace Thufston cuts
out for him. He is equally confident that
he will be returned a winner.
The curtain-raiser will be a four-round
bout furnished by Georgie Curran and
Thomas Woods. This match is a special
event. Each lad has put up a side bet of
150, and the winner of the bout is to take
the purse and side bet. There must be a
decision. Both lads are in training for
the event.
CLEVER JACK ROOT OF CHICAGO. WHO 13 SCHEDULED TO BOX
TWENTY ROUNDS WITH GEORGE BYERS. THE COLORED BOSTON
FIGHTER, ON FRIDAY NIGHT NEXT.
BY C) C. HIBBARD:
CORONADO BEACH, Jan. 14.-The ;
eighteenth annual trials of the Pacific
Coast Field Trial Club were begun on
North Island. Coronado. to-day. Eight
een dogs were run in the derby, a num
ber which has never been exceeded in the
Pacific Coast trials and has been equaled
but once in its history. Birds were found
in abundance, not packed in large bevies,
as was expected, but in small ones num
bering from ten to twenty, and in many
instances the work was done entirely on
elnsfles.
Tne day was exceedingly warm, with
not a breath of. air muvlng, rendering the
atmosphere very oppressive and leaving
apparently no scent from the btrds to
guide the dogs in their work. The result
was a day's sport with little "point" work,
compared with the number of birds
flushed by the dogs and spectators. The
cover on North Island "is too heavy in
many places to show the speed and range
of the does, while other portions, espe
cially that on the northern paxt of toe.
island, has excellent cover.
The first brace down this mornine was
Toa Sloan's pointer dog Prince OVisdom-
Wnisper; with C. E. Woraen's pointer
bucn jingle uoung Jingo-Pearl's LÂ»ot ID.
This brace was cast on. at 8:15 a. m. and
was nut long in tinaing birds. Some point
work was done by eacn, but neither wouifl
honor me point ot nia adversary. Tney
were ordered up at 8:55.
The next orace was Stockdale Kennels'
pointer bitch Jac Cuba (.Cuba of Ken
wood-Ja<julna) with C E. Wilson's Eng
lish setter dog Clipper \V (Maries Sport-
Isabella Aiaiaj. Iney were ordered on at
9 o'clock and the point was made during
ihe heat by Jac Cuba.
Clipper VV* is a handsome dog, with a
high head, very speedy and a stylish goer.
He covered his ground with excellent
judgment, but seemed deficient in nose,
oraered up at 0:37.
W. \V. Van Arsdale's Count's Mark
(Count Gladstone IV-Feach Markj and,
Ueorge Wilcox's English setter dog Stam
ford (.ritamboul-Fannie S) were the next
brace uown. More point work was shown
in this heat than in any other during the
day, as Count's Mark, after the dogs had
found birds, which was in the latter part
of the heat, made five points in rapid suc
cession. The dogs were taken up after a
run of thirty minutes, which was the time
of all heats in the first series.
J. Terry's English setter bitch Lady
(Count Gladstone IV-Peach Mark) and W.
Wi Van Arsdale's pointer dog Dr. Daniels
(.Plain Sam-Dolly Dee II) were next down
and ran one of the best heats of the day.
Both worked their ground with good judg
ment, and while Lady showed much the
better speed and style the dog had a little
the better of the point work.
T. J. A. Tiedemann'a Knglish setter
bitch Northern Huntress (Joe Cummings-
Mecca) and P. D. Linville's English setter
bitch Maggie F (Count Gladstone IV-Lady
Rodschaft) ran the next heat, which
showed the best speed and range for
Huntress, while Maggie F was under bet
ter control and showed better nose.
C. E. Wardens pointer dog Doc (Sams
Bow-Fannette) and R. P. Schwerin's Eng
lish setter dog Peach Stone (Count Glad
stone IV-Peach Mark) followed with a
pointless point.
Stockdale Kennels' pointer dog Bows
Son (Sams Bow-Countess V) and Joe
Singer's English setter dog Lemon Ears
(Stamboul-Fannie S) ran the next heat,
which was all in favor of Bows Son.
S. Christianson's English setter dog Joe

week was not heard from. Meantime, tbe
Saengerfest Athletic Association proceeti

opment in favor of the Saengerfest Ath

session in favor of pulling off the fight
here as scheduled. The business men are
nearly all with the club for the fight. Un
less the political leaders give an ultima

Supervisor McCarthy introduced a reso
lution at yesterday's meeting which pro
vides for the approval by the Board of
Supervisors of the proposed act now be
fore the legislature to prohibit pool sell
ing and bookmaking, except within track
inclosures or buildings where contests are
carried on. McCarthy requested that his
resolution be adopted immediately under
the suspension of the rules, but it was re
ferred to the Police Committee. This
action was not taken, 'however, before the
members had listened to a vigorous
speech by Stafford In which he urged hi3
associates not to stultify themselves by
approving a rfleasure which would undo
whatever good had been accomplished by
the ordinances which, they themselves had
passed. The resolution follows: Â¦
Whereas. There is a bill pending before the
legislature of this State entitled "An act to
prohibit the felling- of pools and bookmaking
on any trial or contest of skill, speed or power
of endurance of, by or between men. animals
or machines, or upon any chance, casualty or
uncertain or contingent event, and the main
taining of places wherein poolselllng or book
making Is carried on, except when said pools
are sold or eald bookmaking Is carried on with
in the racetrack lnclosure, fair grounds or
buildings wherein such trial or contest of skill,
speed or power of endurance of, by or between
men, animals or machines shall be had and
occur, and upon the days when such trials or
contests actually occur or are had; and to pro
vide a punishment for the violation of said
act"; therefore be it
Resolved. That this board approve of the
passage of. said proposed act and earnestly re
quests the Legislature to pass the same.
During the discussion which followed
the reading of the resolution it developed
that the act if passed by the Legislature
would result in the opening of Ingleside
track. Tobin and Braunhart favored the
resolution, but expressed themselves in
favor of limiting the racing period in each
county to thirty, sixty or ninety days. It
was then that Stafford opposed the propo
sition of the board giving its support to
the measure.
"We are doing well now." said Stafford,
"for we have practically rid the com
munity of the iniquities of pool selling.
The act for which the approval of this
board is asked by the resolution will open
wide the selling of pools in this oity. I
say that under the conditions resulting
frcm such an act the city will retrograde.
"We will simply assist the promoters of
the act in inaugurating a general system
of pool selling on every contest that might
take place in any amateur or professional
contest. You are going to open the door
again and evil will result. We should not
give this measure our support. Let us
keep on in the plane we have hitherto
gene by restricting the pernicious selling
of pools."
Dwyer thought the adoption of the reso
lution would be injudicious and it was
then referred to the Police Committee.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14.â Damages in
the sum of $50,000 are asked by A- L. Ban
croft on account of an alleged unsuccess
ful and unskillful attempt to photograph
his shoulder with an X-ray. The defend
ants in the action are Drs. L. A. Perce
and O. C. Welbourn of Long Beach. The
trial of the suit was commenced to-day
before a jury.
The operation was performed about a
year ago. Bancroft was suffering from a
dislocation of his shoulder. He finally
consented to have an X-ray applied to h(s
shoulder to ascertain the exact ailment.
After the operation the flesh where the
X-ray had been applied became sore from
the burn and it continued to grow worse
instead of healing. Bancroft says he was
compelled to submit to four exposures bo
fore a satisfactory photograph had been
obtained.

MAY ELECT QUAY
ON THE FIRST BAIXOT
former Senator Seems to Have a
Majority of Both Houses in the
:Â» Keystone State.
HARRISBURG, Pa.. Jan. 14.â There Is
every indication to-night that the bitter
struggle for United States Senator will
terminate to-morrow with the election of
M. S. Quay, the nominee of the Joint Re
publican caucus. The Democrats will
vote for Colonel James* M. Guffy of Pitts
burg and the anti-Quay Republicans are
expected to distribute their votes among
several "favorite sons."
The House and Senate will vote sep
arately at 3 o'clock to-morrow afternoon
and the probabilities are that Mr. Quay's
combined vote will not fall short of 130.
It requires 127 votes to elect and It is
pretty generally conceded that he will poll
at least this number. Should Mr. Quay
or any other person receive the requisite
number of votes to-morrow the Senate
tfind House will .meet jointly at noon
Wednesday to canvass the returns and
formally declare an election.
There is nothing to indicate to-night
that there, will not be an election on the
first ballot or that there will be another
deadlock similar to that of 1899, when the
Legislature adjourned after taking seven
ty-nine ballots without making a choice.

Special Dispatch to The Call
STOCKTON, Jan. 14.â There is no doubt
in the minds of the peace officers that a
murder was committed in the southern
part of this county early this month. The
body of the victim, an unknown young
man who could not have been over 25
years of age, is now in the Morgue. The
body was discovered by Constable Gieseko
of Tracy. The dead man was lying on his
face in a ditch at the side of the railroad,
between Paradise Cut and the bridge
across the San Joaquin River. The left
hand lay under it and the right arm was
outstretched. The skull was crushed in
in several places. The body was garbed
in underclothes and, a shirt only. The
garments had been expensive. About
twenty feet away a Knox hat was found
with a puff tie folded In the crown.
An autopsy was i performed at the
Morgue to-day and it was found that the
man s skull had been crushed in four
places, evidently with some blunt instru
ment. There was a round hole in the
forehead, which looked as though it might
have been made by a blow from the
rounded head of a mechanic's hammer.
There were similar holes In the left tem
ple, In tho top of the head and in the back
of the head. The body had been covered
by the overflow water from the river and
may have lain there,- the Coroner says, a
week or more.
The deceased was 5 feet V^ inches in
height, had brown hair and brown eyes
and weighed about 140 pounds. The only
clew on which the officers have to work
is the laundry marks which were .found
on the underclothing. The jury at the
inquest returned a verdict of murder.

The Pacific Mail has no intention of

from Central America, and giving equal
facilities to European ports by way of San

road in time equal to that of the Isthmus
route. The greatest competition ever

Assassin.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14.âNotwithstand
ing the evidence of several witnesses that
Dr. John F. Stade, who was found dead
in bed on Saturday afternoon, was de
spondent and frequently threatened to
commit suicide, Coroner Holland to-day
insisted that murder nad been committed,
and succeeded in inducing his jury to re
turn a verdict to that effect.
"There may be a bare possibility that
the man killed himself," said Dr. Holland,
"but it is the most improbable thing in
the world."
The jury retired, and the Coroner's clerk
wrote the following verdict, which each
juror signed:. " â¢
"That deceased came to his death from
the effects of a gunshot wound inflicted
by some party or parties unknown to
the jury."
Henry B. Tucker testified that at the
time of the Galveston Hood Dr. Stade to!d
him he was a heavy loser and seemed de
spondent about it. Ancther witness said
that Dr. Stade always talked of las hard
luck. He saw Stade for the last tlmo on
New Year's day. There were tears in the
doctor's eyes when he said:
"It is not a happy New Year to me."

FINDS MURDERED
YOUTH'S REMAINS
Tracy Constable Discovers
Evidence of Brutal
Crime.
DENVER. Jan. 14.â The joint caucus of
the fusion members of the Legislature to
night decided to support Hon. Thomas M.
Patterson of Denver for. United States
Senator, to succeed Senator Edward O.
Wolcott. There are 91 fusionists in the
Legislature, Including Democrats, Popu
lists and Silver Republicans, and of these
S7 were in the caucus. Mr. Patterson re
ceived 74 votes on the flrst ballot.
The public was surprised early this
evening by the announcement that ex-
Governor Charles S. Thomas, who has
been Mr. Patterson's, leading opponent,
had withdrawn from the race. His name
did not go before the caucus. The total
vote of the Legislature on joint ballot
is 100.
Thomas M. Patterson was born in Ire
land November. 4, 1840. With his parents
he came to America in 1S53. After a short
residence in New York 'the family re
moved to Crawfordsville, Ind., where
Thomas worked for some time in a print
ing office. He was educated in Asbury
(now Depauw) University. He enlisted at
the first call for troops, but served only
a few months on account of poor health.
He read law and practiced his profession
for a time in Indiana. In 1872 he came to
Denver and formed a partnership with
Hon. Charles S. Thomas, who, it ia inter
esting to note, was his leading opponent
in the Senatorial contest just closed. This
partnership lasted a year, but was re
sumed in 1879 and continued until 1890. In
1674 Mr. Patterson was chosen Territorial
Delegate to Congress and greatly aided in
securing "statehood for Colorado. In 1876
he was sent back to Congress, this time
as a Represntative. At the end of his
term Mr. Patterson resumed the practice
of law in Denver. In 1890 he purchased a
controlling interest in the Rocky Moun
tain News, to the conduct of which he has
since very largely devoted his time. In
1S92 Mr. Patterson was a delegate to the
National Democratic Convention. In which
he made a strong fight for the adoption of
a free silver plank. Being unsuccessful he
led the bolt against Cleveland, which car
ried the State of Colorado for Weaver. In
1896 he was a delegate to the Populist Na
tional Convention, which indorsed Bryan,
and in 1900 he was permanent chairman of
the convention of that party. It is under
stood that he now considers himself a
Democrat. - . .
Mr. Patterson in 1S63 was married to Miss
Kate Grafton, a granddaughter of Alex
ander Campbell, the founder of the Chris
tian church. They have one daughter,
Mrs. R. C. Campbell of Denver.

Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN JOSE, Jan. 11.â The charges of
arson and murder growing out of the
burning of the home of Conrad Ruff and
the death of four little children were dis
missed by Justice Rosenthal this after
noon. Sensational developments were ex
pected at the preliminary examination of
Mrs. Sallie Ruff, the stepmother, accused
of having started the lire that caused the
children's death, and the courtroom was
crowded, but the evidence introduced was
very tame.
Mrs. Ruff was present with her attor
i<ey and her husband and hfs three broth
ersâJonas, Ludwig and Carl Ruffâ and
William Valdez, the hired man, all of
whom had in retaliation been charged
with arson by Mrs. Ruff, were interested
spectators. .
William Valdez was the first witness in
Mrs. Ruffs examination on arson. He de
scribed the fire and could give no idea as
to how It started. Louis Ruff, one of the
children that was rescued from the burn
ing building, said the room was so full of
smoke he could hardlv breathe when
taken out of the window. Carl Ruff, ths
complainant, believed Mrs. Ruff had set
lire to the house because she was not ex
cited afterward. He said he swore to thj
warrant because he believed his sister-in
law was going to leave this city and take
the insurance money with her. Mrs. CieU.
a sister of Carl Ruff, was the last witness,
but knew nothing connecting the defend
ant with the conflagration. "X
District Attorney Jarman then asked
the court to dismiss the charge of arson
against Mrs. Ruff. Justice Rosenthal
said no evidence had been presented to
sustain the charge and he doubted that
an^ crime had been committed. He then
ordered the dismissal. This was followed
by a dismissal of the murder charge
against Mrs. Ruff and those of arson
against Conrad, Carl. Jonas and I/udwig
Ruff and William Valdez.
All the arrests seems to have resulted
from a quarrel over the $1000 insurance
money. This had been made payable to
Carl Ruff by Conrad Ruff, and his wife
stopped its payment. The insurance com
pany has watched the cases closely, but
it is not known what action it now will
take in regard to nayment.

TOPEKA. Kans., Jan. 14.â The action of
the Missouri Legislature in defeating a
resolution providing for the raising of a
f.eg over the Capitol building during Its
session has caused considerable indigna
tion In Kansas Grand Army of the Repub
lic circles. Several of the Grand Army
poste of the State have held indignation
ir.eetir.gs and denounced the action of the
Missouri lawmakers. To-day Commander
V.*. A- Martin of the State Department of
the Grand Army of the Republic in an in-.
let view denounced the legislators of the
adjoining State. He said:
'â¢Unfortunately there is no constitution
al provision to prohibit a man making an
ess of himself, and the Missouri legis
lators have availed themselves of the op
portunity to gain a little cheap notoriety.
Notwithstanding their action, which Is
tended to arouse the indignation of every
loyal American, the Stars and Stripes will
Ftill b*> looked upon as the emblem of love
and liberty, an.l the Missouri legislators
have earned the contempt of all patriotic
Americans."

patch as to the flogging of three peace
commissioners by General Dewet near
Lindley last week, and the' shooting of
them: "I am certain the report is false.
Such an act is contrary to General
Dewet's character and controry to the
nature of the policy of the Boers. The
Boers' only hope now is in arousing the
sympathy of the world by the justice of
our cause and our conduct of the war.
Such an act as whipping and shooting
peace commissioners might lose us that
sympathy."
tends the news of a raid on the British

at all events, toward the* redoubtable
enemy of the British empire by General
Kitchener's latest dispatches. Flogging
as a mode of punishment is distinctly op

that by Dewet's orders three agents of the

which he is carrying on a losing fight
against overwhelming odds appeals to the
finer Instincts of the people of this

LONDON. Jan. 14.â England, although
the first naval power In the world, has
not much to boast about in the matter of
naval progress in 1900. Not a single ba*.
tleship was launched during the twelve
monthsâ two first-class armored cruisers,
one third-class cruiser, four sloops and
eighty destroyers completing the listâ and
no real progress has been made with this
year's programme except in the case of
the two new second-class cruisers, as tho
contracts for six new armored cruisers
have only just been given out, and the
first keel plates of two new battleships
will not be laid until the end of March.
It is some consolation to Englishmen to
know that France's naval progress at the
same time has been-greatlv retarded ow
ing to the delay in delivering materials.
Russia made great strides last year, and
in naval progress competition among th*
powers she easily heads the list, Germany
coming next and Japan third, while Eng
land only secured fourth place. Russia
completed and commissioned two flrst
class battleships, one first-class armored
cruiser- and eight destroyers. Moreover,
she launched three nrst-claas battleships,
one lirst-class armored cruiser, one sec
ond-class cruiser, two third-class cruiser3
and three destroyers. The rapidity of Rus
sian shipbuilding was one of the feature*
of the year. ,The armored cruiser Gro

which was only laid down at the Baltic

who is a Nihilist, was condemned to

The bankruptcy of tha Duke of Man

THE SPLENDID GENERALSHIP OF THE GREATEST REMAINING BOER LEADER . HAS DRAWN OUT NO
GREATER TRIBUTE THAN* THE ABOVE CARTOON FROM LONDON PUNCH, UNDER THE HEADIXG "A
HOLIDAY PANTOMIME HE WOULD NOT LIKE REPEATED."
Jan. 14.â Just at the
close of a day of dreary discussion of
technical details of the army reorganiza
tion bill. Teller of .Colorado, speaking to
an amendment he had. offered, delievered
a sensational denunciation of General
Eagan, former commissary general of the
United States army. His statement in
cluded also the administration because"
General Eagan had been, retired, accord
ing to the Colorado Senator's charge, as
a /'decoration and a reward" for his at
tack upon the commanding general of the
army.
Absolutely no progress was made with
the army bill to-day, not a single amend
ment being: disposed of finally.
An amendment was offered by Teller of
Colorado to that section of the bill which
authorizes the President to retire any of
ficer who has been suspended from duty
either by sentence or court-martial or by
executive order in mitigation of such sen
tence, striking out the words "has been"
and substituting therefor "shall be here
after." Â¦ ' - -
After saying that the section had been
incorporated in the bill for the 'purpose
of enabling the President to retire Gen
eral Eagan, former commissary general
of the army, Teller declared it was re
tained in the bill in order that an officer
of the army, Major Joseph "Wham, might
be got rid of. Â¦: -
"He might be got rid of in any other
way," said Teller, "and he ought not be
got rid of in any circumstances." â¢ Â¦
Teller adverted to the case of General
Eagan at some length. "Of the beef fur
nished the army," he said, "it was boiled
and canned and of very ancient lineage,
some of which had made a trip to Eu
rope and back, being fed to our soldiers
after it had been condemned by. Euro
pean governments." -
Mr. Teller denounced General Eagan in
sensational language. "As an officer in
the United States army," said he, "he
made an exhibition of himself and showed
himself to be a miserable blackguard."
Referring to General Eagan's denial of
General Miles' charges as to "embalmed
beef." Teller declared:
"His language was brutal and low and
so bad it could not be overlooked, al
though there was a very evident desire
to overlook it." Â¦V; :
Teller made a stinging attack upon the
President for having retired General
Eagan, asserting that the "retirement in
the circumstances was a decoration and
not a punishment, and many of the Amer
ican people believe it was a decoration
and a reward for his attack upon the gen
eral* commanding the army."
Says His Retirement Was a Reward
for Insulting the Command
ing General of the

MAXILA. Jan. 14.â Representatives of
the Central Catholics at a meeting here
epoke on the subject of religion In the
schools and urged the adoption of amend
ments providing for the employment of
princSpailv native and Catholic teachers
and for permitting religious teaching In
the schools. They .-vrgued that native
teachers could achieve better results than
Americans, and that the public school3
would be far more successful if the pre
vailing religious customs were not dis
turbed.
In order to avoid a lone response from
their opponents on r h*> question of reli
gious teachings in the schools judge Talr
announced that the commie6ion could not
possibly adopt the amendments suggested
by the'Ceniral Catholics.
Tlie commissioners are unanimous In
the belief that a great majority of the
Filipinos desire religious teachings in tha

Since the Legislature is to be asked to provide n
remedy for the new evil, let us hope that care will be
taken this time to avoid the former mistake, and that
the new remedy shall be so devised that its operation
in the complex affairs of modern life will not be worse
than what we havr. now. ?
By reason of these things many thousand acres of
bnd have already passed into the possession of the
State; and of course, unless some, safe and easy
method be provided for disposing of them, v the
amount of land in the hands of the State will event
ually become a serious evil. '
We are having an illustration of this lack of fore
sight in the operation of the statute enacted to pro
tect delinquent taxpayers from the old system of sell
ing their land for taxes. The remedy adopted for
what was thought to be an evil is that of having the
State take possession of land on which taxes are un
paid, giving the delinquent owner five years in which
to redeem his property by paying the taxes due, to
gether with interest upon them. It is a good remedy
for the evil it was aimed at, but unfortunately in some
respects it is worse than the evil itself, and the Legis
lature is to be asked to remedy the remedy.
It appears that under the. operation of the present
law the State is rapidly; becoming a, very large land
owner. When taxes upon a lot of land oncebecome
delinquent the charges and the interest run up so
lapidly that before the five years are out in which the
owner has a right to redeem they exceed the value
of. the land. Under such circumstances the owner
naturally refuses to redeem, and it is said that an out
sider would be foolish to buy it because j)f a possibly
defective title. . ~
r\ LMOST any man can. perceive an evil and de
/^ termine something of its nature; a considerable
* number can go so far as to devise a remedy for
it, .but they are few, indeed, who can foresee how
the remedy will affect other things in the body politic
and know beforehand whether it will be better or
worse than the disease it is designed to cure.
A REMEDY THAT FAILED.-
This marvelous accomplishment has been attained
first by the thorough education of the people of the
State, second by an industrial energy which has made
full use of every manufacturing and commercial pos
sibility, and third by a moral and mental culture
which has prompted the people t*o aspire to the hiizh-
The New England States are not rich in natural
resources and Boston^ has no monopoly of Atlantic
coast commerce. Nevertheless in the savings and co
operative banks of Massachusetts alone there is stored
up one-fifth of the savings of the American people.
One-thirtieth of the population of the United States is
within fifty miles of Boston, and one-twentieth of the
national wealth is held and one-thirteenth of the
clearing-housp business of the country is done within
fifty miles of the New England metropolis.
In all such blowing on the part of Boston there is
nothing for us or for any other portion of the people
of the United States to complain of. The rule laid
down by Joshua at the siege of Jericho is applicable
here: "When I take the trumpet and blow, then take
ye your trumpets and blow also." If any other city
has done as well, the air is free for blowing and the
country' will be glad to hear the sound of it.
The matter is of more interest than that of a passing
pews item of the time. It is worth while for the peo
ple of San Francisco to consider "how Boston .attained
all her wealth in order that a profitable lesson may
be drawn from her example. â¢
Population, however, is the least of the claims of
Boston. It is asserted that her superiority in wcaltK
is much greater than her superiority in numbers, and
that within a radius of fifty miles she has the "best
purchasing community in the world." It is pointed
out that: "The census shows that on a basis of full
and equal valuation Boston is the richest city in the
country, with an average of $1942 for every inhabi
tant, while New York has a per capita wealth of only
$1337; Philadelphia $1127, and Chicago $1016." It :s
added that while the average earning capacity of the
men, women and children of the United States is
onry 40 cents a day, the average for the people of
Massachusetts is 73 cents, or 80 per cent above th'e
general level of the country as a whole. Finally, the
information is derived from a commercial agency in
New York 'that of the $35,600,000 distributed from
that city in interests and dividends at the beginning
of the year, upward of $20,000,000 was assigned to
Boston,, leaving but $.15,000,000 for the rest of the
Union. Â¦ '
The claim of Boston is that she has within a ra
dius of fifty miles a laiger population than any other
equal extent of territory in the United States with the
exception of New York. According to the figures
of the last census there are within the B'oston district
2,849,000 people; in the Philadelphia district 2,545,000;
in the Chicago district 2,167,000. Thus while Boston
holds the fifth place in the list of American munici
palities, it is the center and the market place of the
second most populous territory in the country.
BOSTON, as was to have been expected, has met
the new century by blowing horns metaphorical
rather than literal. Instead of contenting her
self with an uproar in her own streets, she has waited
t'ntil the racket of the occasion in other cities has
died away, and now she is blowing a great trumpet
blast in honor of herself and her glory.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
AAYOR PHELAX made of his banquet to the
officials of the city on Saturday evening an
occasion for renewing his slurs upon che
press. Ignoring the courtesies expected of a host at
such gatherings, he went out of his way to be dis
courteous, and exposed the fact that he has during
his term of office learned as little of good manners
as he has of good politics.
The rudeness of hi; words was the more marked
by the fact that he adopted his slurring tone toward
the press in calling for an address from Mr. Dohr
mann, president' of the Merchants' Association, his
evident intent being to convey the implication that
Mr. Dohrmann shared his sentiment. That intent was
completely foiled by Mr. Dohrmann, who in begin
ning his speech stated emphatically as a clearly un
derstood rebuke to the Mayor, "Gentlemen, I am a
friend of the press."
The Mayor's slur consisted in a reference to whit
he called "an interested press, or the interested edi
tors who sit in high towers and whose mission is so
exalted that they cannot get down to the level of the
common people."
Just what the Mayor meant by sayir.g the press
"cannot get down to the level of the common peo
ple" is hard to say. It has certainly managed at times
to get down to his level long enough to- note
what manner of political muck and mire he
lias -been dabbling in ever" since he was in
vested with the large powers conferred by
the new charter upon the chief executive of the
city. It lias from time to time noted the manner in
which he and his satellites have distorted the plain
purpose of the civil service provisions of the char
ter and converted the municipal" government into a
patronage bureau of the worst kind.
Mayor Phelan entered office under what seemed tc
be conditions favorable to good government. It ap
peared upon the surface that he had been elected by a
non-partisan vote and that he was free to administer
municipal affairs under the new charter fairly and
honestly. In a very short time after the charter went
into operation, however, it was seen that he was
bound to the worst elements in the city. Instead of
reform in any direction there has been a movement
backward and downward. His administration began
with a scandal over the Police Department and has
gone on steadily from bad to worse". He is now so
utterly discredited that he couia not be elected to
any office whatever. His downfall dates from the
iss'ue of The Call of January 16, 1900.
For the loss of his former credit in the city he
blames the press. Because it does not descend to
his politics and that of his g?ng he grows sarcastic
and charges it with being above the level of the coni
cion people. A< a matter of fact, its only of
fense to him is that it does not descend to the level
o* the toadies upon his official power who have flat
tered his head until it is swollen with vanity and be
trayed his feet into prths that have led him to do
lineal ignominy.

The assistant adjutant general of the

the document back to Captain Rowell
through the proper channels, after indors
ing it as follows:
The question of neglect of duty is- not neces
sarily involved. The matter is respectfully
referred i to the quartermaster general of
the department with the suggestion that proper
Inquiry be made concerning the Incident with
regard to loss or destruction of property of the
United States Government.
The judge advocate general will, after
a few days of df liberation, return the doc
ument to the assistant adjutant general of
the Department of the Lakes with the
following indorsement:
Respectfully referred to the judge advocate
general to know If allowing a mouse to enter
haFh in the process of cooking constitutes neg
lect of duty on the part of an acting assistant
cook.
I have the honor to report that en January
4, 1901. Private Brown of my company, while
at mess, discovered a mouse In the hash, which
was a part of the regular day's ration. The
mouse was dead and Private Brown reports
that it had apparently been cooked with the
hash. Following the discovery several mem
bers of Â¦ the company became 111. Private
Brown made complaint of the circumstance to
the mess seg^eant, who confirmed his report.
I, Mhprefore, ordered Private Edward Parker,
assistant cook, confined to quarters and tried
by court-martial, lie appeared before a duly
organized court-martial on the following day.
and after a hearing in the regular form, was
convicted of neglect of duty and fined $5. Very
respectfully. FRANK ROWEL.U
Captain commanding Company A, Second In
fantry.
When Captain Rowell's communication
has reached the headquarters of the De
partment of the I^akes the trouble will be
gin. It will just be indorsed as follows:
AVISTA of awful official possibilities
is opened by the tragedy of the
Fort Thomas mouse which was
found in the mess hall hash, says
the Cincinnati Enquirer. An of
ficial inquiry into all the circumstances
may be expected, at a heavy cost in ink
and paper. Once the official Investigation
is started Captain Rowell, in command of
Company A of the depot battalion, Sec
ond Infantry, wJll take his pen in. hand
and address an official communication to
the assistant adjutant general of the De
partment of the Lakes, something as fol
lows:
In the meanwhile Company A will have
been gradually broken to hash once more.
Newspapers . and Congressmen, however,
will continue to assert that the army
ought to be reduced because its officers
have nothing to do.
Respectfully forwarded to the assistant ad
jutant general 'Of the Department of the Lakes
with the request that the further pleasure of
the department commander may be Indicated.
The beauty of the "paper" system of the
War Department is that at this point
Captain Rowell will not be permitted to
tear the paper tip. Once more he will take
his well worn pen in his weary hand and
this time he will write:
Respectfully referred back to Captain Rowell
Â¦with the report that no hash belonging to the
ITnlted States Government was lost. At thÂ«
time of its loss it had passed from the posses
sion of the Government to Individual members
of Company A. The mouse was not discovered
until after the hash had been eaten. No extra
lation was served on the occasion, and especial
ly no extra hash.
But Captain Rowell will not thus easily
bring the incident to a close. The paper
will come back to him with the signature
of the post quartermaster and the follow
ing new indorsement:

and write another indorsement, as fol
lows:
Respectfully referred back to the officer com
manding Company- A. Second Infantry, with
the recommendation that a board of survey be
convened at once to ascertain the money value
of the hash, not the mouse.
In the course of a week or a month or so
the paper will return with a new indorse
ment, as follows: . ,

modes of Identification to Indicate that the

and think. He will subsequently hunt up

widely indorsed document and will in

Morocco holds a most important strategic point in
North Africa, and neither of the great powers has
been willing to see it pass into the hands of another.
It appears, however, that the "psychological moment"
has come at last. The nations are agreed. France is
to give up her rights in Newfoundland and Great
Britain is to give up all opposition to France in
Morocco. What concession has been given to Ger
many does not appear, but doubtless the Kaiser has
been satisfied in some" way, and so the new century
begins with another of those bargains by which great
nations make friends with one another at the expense
of tlie weak.
It is not clear what claim the British have in
Morocco, but it is quite certain that neither Great
Britain nor Germany was willing to permit France
to annex any considerable portion of the territory of
the Moors. Consequently the advance of the French
in that direction was suspended. The situation, ho/w
ever, has continued critical cer since. The experience
of the world has been that when once a nation be
gins to conquer weaker nations and take possession
of their territory the expansion must keep on. Great
Britain found it so in India. Russia lias found it so
in Central Asia. Germany will- find it so in Africa
as soon as she begins to develop her possessions in
that continent. When the civilized man comes "into
contact with the barbarian or the savage it is impos
sible to draw a line beyond which there shall' be no
aggression.
Of all the partition schemes the great nations have
undertaken at the expense of the weak this is perhaps
the oddest. For a long time the French have been
looking with longing eyes upon a portion of Morocco
bordering the French province of Algeria. Once or
twice there have been conflicts along the line, and
readers with good memories may recall that last year
there was a little war scare in Europe brought about
by the extension of a French railroad toward the
oasis of Twat, in the desert of Sahara. The best way
for the road to reach Twat was across territory be
longing to Morocco, Â«nd, moreover, Morocco herself
claimed the oasis. So there was prospect of war, and
diplomatists were busy in every capital in Europe.
self, for it is territory belonging to' Morocco.
It now appears that a sufficient consideration has
been found; that at last Great Britain has a price to
pay which France is willing to accept. It is not a
money price. France would scorn that. It is a con
cession of territory many hundred times larger and
richer than the barren shore France claims in New
foundland. It happens! moreover, to be territory,
which Great Britain can concede without loss to her-
Far away back in the .eighteenth century a treaty
was made between the British and the French whereby
the fishermen of France were to have certain im
portant privileges not only in the Newfoundland
fisl^eries but on the Newfoundland shore. Those
privileges have fretted the people of Newfoundland
for many a year, and time after time. an earnest peti
tion has been sent to the British. Government to put
an end to them. The French, however, have clun;;
to them persistently â more, perhaps7from sentimental
than from industrial reasons. It is the last vestige,
of their former great possessions in that part of the
â¢world, and woe would have befallen any French
Government that surrendered it to Great Britain for
any consideration whatever. S

Under our system of law the relations of attorney
and client must of necessity be based upon confidence
on the one side and integrity on the other. There
nre at the present time in the United States interests
amounting in value to- many millions of dollars rest
ing solely upon the word of lawyers. Something like
commercial chaos would ensue if the bar should fall
below the standard of honor established in the past,
and to which all clients trust when they seek counsel.
The number of scandals in this city resulting fro*r;
dishonesty on the part of attorneys has become a re
rious injury to the community. It is time for the Bir
Association to take 'action. "
Finally it is charged that Watt, still acting as at
torney for Mrs. Underhill, undertook to look after
her interests in the Latham Company in Chicago,
and while he was in that city obtained from her the
sum of $30,000 ostensibly to maintain the Latham
Company and so protect her interests in the firm,
but up to this time has never given his client an ac
counting of what he did with the money, notwith
standing the fact that the Latham Company went into
dissolution.
âSo far as appears from the record the only defense
made by Watt is that all claims Mrs. Underhill has
against him are offset by his services as attorney.
Can any honest member of the Bar Association
doubt that such charges should be investigated?
It is further charged that while Watt was acting as
attorney for Mrs. Underhill, she being in New .York
and he in this city as her agent and legal adviser, it
became his duty to remit certain sums of money to
her, hut instead of remitting the money or valid drafts
he sent her three checks drawn upon the American
Eank and Trust Company of this # city, each and all of
them being valueless, so that when presented for pay
ment they were dishonored and returned unpaid.
It is to be borne in mind that the charges against
Watt are not vague and indefinite. He is specifically
charged with having given to his client, Mrs. Under
hill, ?.s security for money borrowed from her, two
mortgages, each of which had been satisfied and dis
charged long before Watt made use of them as a
pretended security for his loan.
Under these circumstances about the only way in
which Watt can be tried for the alleged dishonesty
toward his client is for the Bar Association to sum
mons him to answer the charges and investigate them
impartially but thoroughly. The public has a right
to expect the association to perform that duty.
In one important respect the duty of the associa
tion in the Watt case is much more imperative than
in that of Chretien or in that *of Rogers. Those of
fenders were in the hands of the courts held to
answer to charges of crime. It-jvas therefore pos
sible for the Bar Association to make the specious
pica that those cases should be left to the courts alone.
No such plea can be advanced as a reason for ignoring
the charges in the case that has now been brought to
light. James Alva Watt has not been summonsed to
answer at the bar for crime, nor can he be sum
monsed to answer in that, way for the particular of
fenses charged, since they were committed so long ago
that the statute of limitations prevents prosecution.
ONCE more the Bar Association of San Fran
cisco is on trial before the bar of public
opinion. Nothing was done by the association
to redeem the legal profession in this city from the
stain put upon it by the conduct of Chretien and of
Rogers. It now remains to be seen whether any
thing will be done to investigate the charges made
upon good evidence against the professional honesty
of James . Alva Watt in his dealings with his client,
Mrs. Fannie A. Underhill, as published in The Call on
Sunday morning.
A DUTY OF THE BAR.
Members of the Cabinet receive $8000 a
year, and the seme amount is paid to the
Vice President of the United States. Rep
resentative Loi;denslaBer of New Jersey
has introduced a bill increasing the sala
ries of the Cabinet officers to $15,000 and
that of the Vice President to. $25,000. It
Is a bill that ought to be adopted. The
history of the United States is full of in
stances where the services of brilliant
men have been lost to the country be
cause of the failure of Congress to pro
vide adequate compensation. The social
conditions of high official life in Wash
ington are such that few men can go into
the Cabinet unless they have independent
fortunes. The salary does not begin to
pay the expenses. A President must,
therefore, as a rule, make up his Cabinet
from among the wealthy classes, and
therefore he Is restricted. The only fault
we find with this bill is that it does not
go far enough. It should include the Em
bassadors. Only rich men can represent
this country in I-ondon, Paris, Berlin or
St. Petersburg. Out of their salary they
must rent expensive housos and must
meet their own expenses. There are fÂ«>w
more extravagant places than St. Peters
burg, and it is very seldom that a Minis
ter has remained at the Russian court for
a full term. Not only should our Embas
sadors be better provided for In the way
of salary, but in the great capitals the
Government should own the buildings oc
cupied by its representatives. â Philadel

plished it. David L* Stain and Oliver
Cromwell, two men long past middle age,
were confined in the Maine State prison
on !ife sentences for a murder committed
eleven years apo. Six months ago evi
dence came into the possession of the
Herald which showed that a doubt existed
as to the guilt of the prisoners. The pa
per instantly set an Investigation on foot,
followed it up at its own expense, and
finally found conclusive proof that these
men wer/ suffering punishment for a
crime committed by other persons. The
proof was laid before the authorities, a

The total railway mileage of the United
States is 190.000 miles. Of that over 45,080
miles is owned by roads whose policy 19
controlled at this time by J. Pierpont Mor
gan by virtue of his own holdings and the
confidence reposed in him by English
bondholders and by certain Americans
who are large holders of railway securi
ties. E. H. Harriman and his associates
control railroad systems, .chiefly west of
the Mississippi, which have a mileage of
over 24,70") miles. There are roads which
are not subject to the control of either of
these railway kings, but whose managers
approve of their policy. The Pennsylvania
and Santa Pe a"re the more important of
these outside roads. The object of this
concentration of railway control in a few
hands is the prevention of rate cutting. â

Massachusetts early learned the value of manufac

fit young men to engage successfully in carrying them
on. She has had to bring from a distance nearly all
of the raw material upon which her factories worked.
In California we would have a great advantage over
her in that respect, for our natural resources are
abundant. It is, then, worth our while to see if we
cannot, surpass her in the future. We have a better

presented to it to find out whether or not
certain petitioners were freeholders of the
district, and declared that the Templeton
Sanitary District was not a legally or
ganized district. Stumpf brought suit as
a taxpayer and the lower court held that
the order made by the Supervisors was
valid. The Supreme Court holds that the
order was Invalid.

STOCKTON MAN WANTS
DAMAGE FROM RAILROAD
W. H. Shannon Claims the Southern
Pacific Has Infringed Upon
Patented Guard Bail.
\V. II. Shannon of Stockton has begun
suit for damages against the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company for alleged in
fringement on a patent which Shannon
claims to have been granted him five or
six years ago. The device Is Intended for
use where railroads cross each other at
right angles. Before the idea was con
ceivedMhe crossings were bolted down to
a bedplate, with which they were so thor
oughly incorporated that whenever any
one of the four corners was badly worn
the whole crossing hud to be torn up.
The invention consists mainly of rectan
gular pieces, acting as gxiard rails at each
corner of the crossing, and they are so
adjusted that In making repairs a great
deal of time, labor and expense Is saved.
According to Mr. Shannon all the rec
tangular crossings on the Southern Pa
cific, Santa Fe and other roads are pat
terned after his device, consequently he
intends to collect damages for alleged In
fringement. Photographs have been taken
of every crossing in the Southern Pacific
system, and these will be used as evi
dence when the case comes to trial. The
action ngainst the railroad will involve
many thousands of dollars. -

Edward J. Morris, formerly a hackman,
appeared before Judge Conlan yesterday
on a charge of grand larceny. He was
accused of stealing Dr. Mark Newman's
fox terrier Sunday afternoon. Detective
T. B. Gibson' had occasion to call at Dr.
Newman's house. 253 Turk street, and
when the door was opened to admit him
the dog ran out. Morris happened to be
passing at the time and he picked up the
dog and walked away with It. Dr. New
man followed him and asked him to give
up the dog, but he refused, claiming it
was one he had lost. The doctor - called
Gibson and ordered him to place Morris
under arrest. Then 'Morris wanted to
"cut It all out," as he expressed it, but
tho doctor would not have it. The c^ae
was continued till Thursday and- Morris
was released on $100 bonds, accepted by
the Judge. The dog was sent home with
Dr. Newman.
J. W. Moore was arrested early yester
day morning on a charge of an atte'mpt to
commit burglary. The complaining wit
ness was I>awrence Moran; 6SI Mission

baniss yesterday on a charge of forgery
preferred against him by Nils Jessen,

dence was given that Relckenberg had
been wounded on the head ln a battle with
Indians some years ago and his skull had
boon ieprossed. which made him irrespon
sible. In the Oakland hospital an opera

235=the square root.
Explanation: Point off the number into
periods of two figures each, beginning at
the right. Find the. largest possible num
ber which when squared will divide the
first period. 3 squared is 9 and is too large.
2 squared is 4 and will divide the first
period, which is 5. Place the 2 as divisor
at the left and ln the quotient space at
the right. Divide, subtract and bring
down as in long division, only two figures
(a period) are brought down Instead of
one. Now we change the quotient each
time. The new quotient is found by
doubling the answer thus far secured. 2
double cive3 4. 4 into 13 (omitting the 2)
win go 3 times. Place the 3 in the answer
space and also after the 4 in the divisor.
Now multiply. 3 times 43 equals 129. Sub
tract and bring down as before. For a
new divisor double the 23 and we have 46.
This divided Into 232 (omitting the 5) will
go 5 times. Place the 5 in the divisor and
multiply. Then 235 is the required square
root.
Exercises.
Find the square root in each Instance;
1. 3025 6. 11664 11. 4C36
2. 9604 7. 21025 12. 5184

Noteâ The student can prove the correctness
of his answers by squaring them. For instance,
we 'know that 15 is the square root of 225 be
cause 15 times 15=225.
XXXâ HOW TO MULTIPLY DECI
MALS.
Multiplication of decimals should be ar
ranged in the manner indicated ln the fol
lowinsr examples:
Â« 'J Multiply 3.6S04 by 25.13.
3.68 O4 ' Arrange the decimals
23.13 one under the other so
that the decimal points
73.60 8 may be in tho same col
18.4O 2O umn. BegiD the multl
.36 8O4 plication with the left
.11 0412 hand figure of tho mul-
tipllerâ that is, with the
92.4U18452 2; but since to multiply
by 2 in the tens' place
is in reality to multiply
by 20, the result must be written one place
to the left cf its natural position, the
decimal point being kept in the same
place as those above it. Then multiply in
succession by the 5. X. 3; at each stage
writing the result one place to the rl^ht
of that last obtained and preserving the
column of decimal points. Lastly, add the
partial products as in ordinary addition
of decimals.
The advantage of this arrangement is
that it lends Itself to contracted multipli
cation when only an approximate result
is required. ,
In this example all the figures to the
right of the vertical line except one col
umn could be omitted and yet the product
would be the same to two decimal places.
A thorough knowledge of decimals Is a
necssary foundation to satisfactory work
In mathematics.
XXXIâ HOW TO DISTINGUISH
"WORDS THAT ABB OFTEN CON
FOUNDED.
â¢ (Supplementary Paper.)
BY PROFESSOR H. G. BUEHLER.
Carry, Bring, Fetch â To carry means "to
lake along in going"; to bring means "to
take along in coming"; to fetch means "to
go, get and bring"; as. "What shall I
bring you from Paris?" "Harry, please
fetch a chair from the hall"; "Farmers
carry their potatoes to market."
Character, Reputationâ Character is
what a man is: reputation is the prevail
ing opinion of his character; as, every one
admires the character of Washington";
"A distinguished general may lose his
reputation through a single blunder."
Claim, Assert. Allejre. Maintain. De
clare, Affirm, State â To claim means prop
erly "to demand as one's own or one's
due." It is often looselv used, especially
in the United States, for "assert," "al
lege," "maintain," "declare" or affirm."
To assert is "to say or declare ln the face
of implied denial or doubt." To alleee is
"assert without proof." To maintain 13
to "uphold by argument." To declare is
to "say publicly, clearly or emphatically."
To affirm Is to "assert on one's reputation
for knowledge or truthfulness." To state,
which is often loosely uted in the sense of
"say," "assert," "allege," "declare" or
."affirm," means properly to express form
ally and in detail.
Complement, Compliment â A comple
ment is a "full quantity or number" or
"that which Is needed to complete": a
compliment is "an expression of praise";
as, "The ship . has its complement of
stores"; "Present my compliments to your
father."
Continual, Continuousâ Continual is used
of frequently repeated acts; as, '-'Contin
ual dropping wears away a stone": con
tinuous, of uninterrupted action: as "The
continuous flowing of a river." v ":.*-
Custom, Habitâ Cuslom denotes the fre
quent repetition of the same act. and may
be used by a number of persons taken to
gether. Habit is the effect of custom in
a person. Custom i3 voluntary: habit is
involuntary, often uncontrollable, some
times unconscious. The following sen
tences are correct: "Dancinc round a
May-pole is a custom many hundreds of
years old"; "A loose life brings a man In
to habits of dissipation."
Deadly, Deathlyâ Deathly, in the sense
of "resembling death." as "She wa3
deathly pale," is prererable to deadly,
since deadly also means "inflicting
death"; as, "The bite of some insects is
deadly." ' Â¦
Different From, Different Toâ Different
from is preferable to aifferent to and dif
ferent than. .
Drive, Rideâ We go driving in carriages,
riding In saddles. We drive bei-.nd horses;
we ride on them.
Dumb. Stupidâ Dumb properly means
"mute " "silent." Its misuse for stupid Is
partly due. especially in Pennsylvania, to
its resemblance to the German dumm.
Emigration. Immigrationâ Emigration
moving out from a country; Immigration,
the moving into it. Foreigners who come
to live in America aro emigrants from
their fatherland, immigrants to America.
Funny, Oddâ Funnv means "comical";
in the "sense of "strange" or "odd" it id
not in good use.
Grand Gorgeous, Awful, Etc.â Grand
properly Implies "grandeur"; gorgeous
means "having splendid colors"; awful,
"inspiring awe or terror": elegant, "hav
ing elegance"; splendid, having splendcr
â I. e., brilliant luster"; lovely, "of sur
passing loveliness": m&gnlflcent, "grand
in action or appearance." â¢
Emerson, in his essay on "The Superla
tive" wrote as follows: "We talk, some
time's with people whose conversation
would lead you to suppose that they had
lived in a museum where all the objects
were monsters and extremes. â¢ â¢ â¢ They
use the superlative or grammar â 'most
perfect " 'most exquisite,' 'most horrible."
Like the French, theyare enchanted, they
are desolate, because you have got or
have not got a shoestring or a wafer you
happen to wantâ not perceiving that
superlatives are diminutives and weaken.
? â¢ > â¢ All this come3 of poverty. We are
unskilled deflners. i From want of skill to
convey quality, we hope to move admira
tion by quantity. Language should aim
to describe the fact. â¢ â¢ â¢ 'Ti3 very
wearisome, this straining talk, the?e ex
periences all exquisite, intense and tre
mendous."
Hire. Let. Lease â To hire means "to ob
tain the use. of"; to let. "to give the use
of." To lease means "to give the u?e of
by lease." The.owner of a house leases it;
the person who occupies it takes a leas*
of It.

XXIX. V v
It is necessary truaimost all mechanical
work that the stutAnt should understand
how to find the square root of large num
bers. The square, of a number is the
product of the number by Itself; as. 25 is
the square of 5, 16 is the square of 4. The
square root of a number is the number
which multiplied by itself will produce
the number; as, 5 is the square root of
25; i2 is the square root of 141.
Suppose thit it is necessary to find the
square root cf 6u2JS. The process is as
follows:
Home means one's habitual abode, â¢'the
abiding place of the affections." It may or
"may not be in a house, and it may include
the surroundings of a house:
How â How properly means "in what
manner" or "to what extent." It is often
misused for "that" to introduce an object
clause.
In. Intoâ In implies presence inside of.
or within; Into implies movement to the
Inside of. Before a man can move in a
room, he must already have moved into it.
Invent. Discoverâ We invent something
new; contrived or produced for the first
time: as. "Galileo invented the tele
scope. We discover what existed before,
but remained unknown; as. "Xewton dis
covered the law of gravitation."
.., LAte ,f t ' Lastâ Latest, like the woni
late, contains a distinct reference to
time; that is latest which comes after all
?JiJ\5 r8 , ln tIme : as "The latest news';
"The latest fashion." Last, which was
originally a contraction of latest, is now
used without any distinct reference to
time, and denotes that which comes after
all others in space or In series: as, "The
it st -wÂ°uf e on tne stre et"; "The Last cf
the Mohicans.
Learn, Teachâ Learn means to "ac
quire" knowledge, not to "impart" it. In
the latter sense the proper word is teach.
befLo^ljr^Kii 11 tc " day thaa : had
"This has learned you something," ia!d Mr.
uofi.
? '1PÂ£\ no "" re I>i le< * Mr. Sheehan. "it has
taught mÂ« something."â From a newspaper.
Let, Leave â Let, means "to permit":
leave, "to let remain," or "to go away
f.VT 1 "' as ' " Please let me go with you":
I leave that to your own judgment."
Locate. Findâ Locate properly means "to
place in a particular position." or "to
designate the site of," as of a new build
ing or purchased lands; it does not mean
to find. It is correct to say. "Where will
the hetf schoolhouse be located?" It Is
not In accordance with the best usage to
say. "The police have located the missinjr
man."
Mad, Angryâ Mad means "insane"* in
the sense of "angry" it is not tn good use.
Materializeâ To materialize properly
means "to make or to become physically
perceptible"; as, "By mean3 of letters we
materialize our ideas and make them as
lasting as ink and paper"; "The Ideas of
the sculptor materialize in marble."
Mutual. Commonâ Mutual properly
means "reciprocal." "interchanged."* It
is often misused for common in the sense
of "belonging equally to both or all." es-.
pecially in tha phrase. "A mutual friend."
The .following sentences are correct:
"They parted with mutual good feeling":
"I find. Miss Helen, that we have some
cemmon friends."
l"Â«ear, Nearlyâ Near Is an adjective; tha
corresponding adverb is nearly; as, ""We
are near the end of the lesson": "We
were nearly dead."
On To, Onto â Good use dge3 not support
either on to or onto.
Partly. Partiallyâ Partly, in the sense
cf "in part. 1 ,' is preferable to partially,
since partially also means "with partlal-
Person, Partyâ A person Is an Individ
ual; a rarty Is a company of persons, or.
in legal usage, a person who is concerned
in a contention or agreement.
Proposal. Propositionâ A proposal f*
something proposed to be done, which
may be accepted or rejected. A proposi
tion is something proposed for discussion,
with a view to determining the truth or
wisdom of it.
Quite. \ eryâ Quite properly means "en
tirely"; in the sense of "very" or "to a
considerable degree" it is not In good use.
Receipt, Recipeâ Receipt, in the sense
of "formula for a pudding," etc., is pref

Real, Really, Veryâ Real Is properly an
adjective, meaning "not imaginary or
counterfeit"; as, "real diamonds." Its
misuse for the adverbs really and very,
as. "This is real pretty." Is a vulgarism.
Some, Somewhat, Somethingâ Some is
an adjective; as, "Some water"; "Some
brighter clime." Somewhat is an adverb;
as. "He is somewhat better." "Some
what" is occasionally used as a noun; as.
"Somewhat of doubt remains," but In this
sense something is more common.
Start, Begin, Commenceâ To start is "to
set out" or "to set going," and is not fol
lowed by an infinitive. Before an lnflni
tiv<*, "begin" or "commence" is used. Be
gin is preferred in ordinary use; com
mence has more formal associations with
law and procedure, combat, divine service
and ceremonial.
Transpire. Happen â To transpire means
pioperly "to escape from secrecy to no
tice," "to leak out"; It should not be used
in the sense of to happen.
When. While â When means "at the time
that"; while, "durins the time that," "as
long as." When fixes attention on a data
or period; while fixes attention on the
lapse of time.
crowded. The piece Is badly constructed,
but the company is strong enough . to
make the most of the situations, and the
laughter is almost incessant. Charles
Drake, Frank J.- Gorman and "William
Friend are clever in their way, and among
the ladies Miss Beatrice Norman and Miss
Otilie de Lano are excellent.
Tivoli.
"Cinderella," on again this week at the
Tivoll, is a glitter of wit, songs, costumes
and settings, and of all the firefly dance
by the electric girls is the crowning fea
ture. Here la a dance â an electric ballet â
that Kuropean or Eastern bills have not
yet announced. It is a San Franciscoâ a
Tivoliâ production and its merit is- as
great as is its brilliancy. Four pretty
girls draped in scintillating robes of fire
appear in the dance. Hidden In the folds
of the costume of each are fifty-six 8-can
dle power electric lights, while eight 1
candle and one 16-candle power lights dec
orate the head dress of each dancer. In
all 260 lights, 3000 feet of wire and twelve
circuits are utilized in producing the ef
fect. This is the reward of six months'
constant experiment and the result well
repays the time and energy expended.
.From other places have come those whose
claims to fame have been builded on the
splendor of the scenes amid which they
danced, but at the Tivoli, in "Cinderella,"
new ideas have been set to more brilliant
Bcenes.
Hartman produced new jests last even
ing and toward his example his support
leaned with pleasing result.

Lee Tyler, soprano; Hanlon and Singer, on

Dave Barton, singing comedian, and

Fischer's Concert House.
Frank 'Karl and Ray Hampton presented
a laughable hit at Fischer's Concert
House lust night. It was entitled "The
Trouble of a Darktown Dandy," and the
specialties introduced were good. Oro,
.Bernard and Oro continued their sketch,
"Scenes in Chinatown," and Marie D.
Wqod changed her songs. The Russell
brothers gave a wonderful aerial perform-"

as a globe, serpentine and lire dancer.
Sid Baxter gave an excellent aerial jug
gling act and Edyth Leslie" sang several
sweet Hongs charmingly. The house was
packed.
Olympia.
There is a good bill at the Olympla this
week. Querita Vincent,- an old favorite,
received a warm reception last night, and
Mabel Hudson, Ouhama, Annette George
and the rest of the company came in for
their full share of tho applause.
Alhambra.
The farce "A Stranger in a Strange
Land" has made a hit at the Alhambra

Four elephants of assorted sizes are the
attraction at the Orpheum this week. This
is a novelty in vaudeville, but then any

The sagacious beasts do wonderful things,
displaying an intelligence almost human

They dance and play a variety of instru
ments, including the mouth harmonica,
the cymbals, the hand organ and the bass
drum. The bicgest of the four plays
ninepins with skill, and his partner marks
with chalk on a slate the number of pins
bowled over. But the most sensational
feat of all is the riding of a tricycle by
the baby elephant. Billy Link, the new
mcnolosrist, comes to the front with
some jokes that, while brand new in
Gotham, are gray and bald with age in
San Francisco. He has a laugh, however,
that is as infectious as the smallpox.

Orpheum.
The unfortunate persons engaged in
presenting: this atrocity to the public
have as much mistaken their profession

native mud to woo his bedraggled Muse

of this company cannot act, the singers

The melancholy performance presented
last night at the California Theater can
not be classified under any known dramat
ic category. It is neither farce, burlesque,
extravaganza, parody, pantomime, fish,
flesh, fowl nor good red herring. It is
like the earth in pre-Adamite timesâ
without form and void. It has neither
rhyme, wit, humor, satire, sense nor non
sense. Compared to "A BreÂ«zy Time,"
a Broadhurst farce is a masterpiece. The
force of a comparison can no further go.
California,
Two new names appear on the pro
gramme this week, those of Fay Courte
nay, who looked and played in a charming
and clever fashion the blind orphan
Louise, and Maud Miller, the daughter of
Joaquin Miller, who made her lirst ap
pearance at the theater as Marianne, the
outcast, and created a quite favorable im
pression by her work.
Howard Hall is well suited in the peri
wigged hero's part, the Chevalier de Vau
drey, and was received in the usual en
thusiastic fashion Dy the audience. Clar*
ence Arper does well as the~~ Count de
Llnieres; Stanley Ross as the Marquis de
Prestes; while Ernest Howell and Miron
Lefflngwell as the outlaws both do clever
work-
Miss Darling has a good opportunity in
the part of Henrietta and confirm* the
strong Impression in her favor as an
emotional actress that she has already
made upon her San Francisco audiences.
Margaret Marshall, as La Frochard, gives
a clever character sketch and Kitty Bel
moure, as the Countess de Llnleres, was
well heard. Next week, "Darkest Rus
sia."
It Is to weep .this week at the Central
Theater, a nice comfy weep, without any
fear of the pearly tear congealing upon
one's youthful countenance. For the new
steam heater Is a distinct success, not to
mention "The Two Orphans," and the
only apparent danger now is that one's
liquid emotion may go up in steam. When
the snow It snowed last night (and who
ever heard of an orphan fit-out without a
snowstorm?) nary a shiver struck the per
spiring audience. It had troubles of its
own and would willingly have taken a
turn under the falling Hakes itself, as it
surreptitiously mopped its brow and took
off its coat. No, there's no chance of a
shiver up at the Central this week and
those who are looking for one must go
forth and find elsewhere.
I Yesterday was a field day at the Pre
sidio for the representatives 6f the rail
road companies, as 1C2 volunteers were
discharged. Previous to the discharge of
these men the railroad companies had
combined, and a representative from the
Southern Pacific, the Panta Fe and the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company
handled the business. The soldiers upon
payment of the price of a ticket were
given orders for tickets that entitled them
to transportation over any of the lines.
The business was divided on the per
centage plan. Thl3 was evidently unsat
isfactory to the Oregon line people, for
yesterday they broke away from the other
people and sold tickets independent of the
combine. A merry war was thus inaug
urated, as the Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe representatives telephoned to the main
offices for reinforcements. The soldiers
relished the competition, although the
war did not result in any change of rates.
Paymasters Kelleher, Kilbourne and
Wilklns paid off the men, many of them
receiving a considerable sum, as the re
sult of from a year to eighteen months'
service in the Philippines.
Lieutenant A. M. Davis, Fourth Cavalry,
has been made captain and commissary.

Company I, Twentieth Infantry, died yes

The bodies of seventy-two soldiers that
arrived on the freight transport Califor
nian were taken to the Presidio yesterday
and stored, awaiting burial or shipment
east to relatives. The remains are those
oi men who died or were killed in China.
Ground was broken yesterday at the
General Hospital for the erection of an
assembly hall and chapel. These improve
ments have been In contemplation for
some time, but work was delayed until
the arrival of the necessary permission
irom the department. â¢ The assembly hall
will be used by the soldiers for dances,
concerts and various entertainments held
heretofore in the mess hall.

How shall a mother who is weak and sick with some
female trouble bear healthy children ?M
How anxious women ought to be to give their children
the blessing of a good constitution !
Many women long for a child to bless their home, but be-
cause of some debility or displacement of the female organs,
they- are barren.
\ 'Preparation for healthy maternity is accomplished by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound more suc-
cessfully than by any other medicine, because it gives tone
and strength to the parts, curing all displacements and in-
flammation.
Actual sterilitv in women is very rare. If any woman
thinks she is sterile, let her write to Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn,
Mass., whose advice is given free to all expectant or would-
be mothers.
Mrs. A. D. Jarret, Belmont, Ohio, writes:
" Deah Mrs. Pinctam : â I must vrrite and tell you what your Vege-
table Compound has done for mo. Before taking your medicine I was unable
to carry babe to maturity, having lost two â one at six months and one at
peven. The doctor eaid next time I would die, but thanks to lij dia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, I did not die, but am the proud I
mother of a 6ii months old girl baby. She weighs nineteen pounds and Â¦
has never seen a sick day in her life. She is the delight of our home. " 1

before and during the district and State

RAILWAY BACKING
FRANCHISE BILL
California Miners' Association was pre
sented In the Assembly by Assemblyman
Irish and in the Senate by Senator Tyrrell
of Nevada this morning. The document
is explanatory of bills already Introduced,
providing for the appropriation of $150,000
additional for the construction of Im
pounding and restraining dams In the
hydraulic and placer mining region. Fol
lowing is the petition:
The California Miners' Association, through
Its executive committee, begs to call your at
tention to the following facts:
1. In 1893 the Legislature of this State appro
priated $250,000 to be used in the construction
of works for the restraining and impounding
of debris resulting from mining operations,
natural erosion and other causes.
2. This appropriation was not to become
available until the United States Government
should have appropriated at least an equal
amount for the same purpose.
3. In 1S96 Congress appropriated J230.000 for
the above purpose.
4. After a most careful and painstaking ex
amination and study of the matter the Fed
eral engineers submitted their plans for the
contemplated work.
5. These plans involve an expenditure of
$SO0.0OO Instead of $a00.000, leaving a deficiency
of $300,000 to be made up by the State and
National Governments.
6. Through the emergency river and harbor
bill of June 6, 1900, Congress made provision
for the immediate commencement of the con
templated work and its prosecution to the ex
tent of the then available State and National
appropriations, amounting to a total of $300.
000. To this provision. In the emergency river
and harbor bill of 1900 there was added a
proviso to the effect that one-half of the cost
of the contemplated work should be paid by
the State of California.
7. The plan of the Federal engineers for the
entire work. Involving an expenditure of $800,
000. has been approved by the State Board of
Examiners of this State, and bills looking to
the appropriation by the State of California of
the further sum of $150,000, as its final contri
bution to the contemplated work, have already
been Introduced In the Senate and Assembly.
These bills are known as Senate bill No. 127
and Assembly bill No. 4<J, and were Introduced
by Senator Tyrrell of Nevada and Assembly
man Irish of Sierra.
8. It is well understood that further appro
priation by Congress is contingent upon tl>Â«
action of your honorable bodies.
We therefore most respectfully and earnestly
request early and favorable action at your
hands upon the measures above noted.
E. C. VOOHHEIS,
President California Miners' Association.

o'clock this morning with a rather full
attendance. Introduction of bills was
passed in the order of business, as the
clerks were not prepared to receive them.
A flood of resolutions was turned loose
on the Assembly, in the main relating to
unimportant matters.
Resolutions by Ralston and Merrltt dis

PROCEEDINGS
OF ASSEMBLY
The witness testified to seeing her do
many Queer and boisterous acts In the
boarding-house at 712 Van Ness avenue.
where she ia being kept at present. At
times she would spring upon the foot cf
the bed and kick It. Imagining she waa
riding horseback.
"But has she never done one Intelligent
act during these two years?" was asked.
"She calls E. II. Wakeman all the names
she can think of," replied the boy.
Chapman said Chat he didn't want to
ask any more questions.
A. A. Baroteau was called and asked
whether he had taken Lady Yarde-Bul
ler from the house where she was living
in Oakland up to the middle of November,
and had gone with her to Alameda and
thence to San Francisco.
The "Baron" denied the charge, but ad
mitted that he was at the house for some
time before her Ladyship went away, and
that they happened to take the same car
to Alameda and also went on the same
boat to San Francisco In the morning.
"Did you not go with her to a notorious
house In Alameda?" asked Fitzgerald.
"I did not."
"Did you not admit having done so in
conversation with me? Remember, you
are under oath."
"Honest, I never did."
"Your Honor," said Mr. Fitzgerald, "I
am utterly at a loss to comprehend this
answer."
The hearing will go on to-morrow.
On cross-examination Chapman wanted
to know whether she was insane all the
time.
Chapman at once objected to the ques
tion. Judge Ellsworth ruled that it was
permissible only if Fitzgerald proposed to
submit proof of Insanity. Fitzgerald de
clared that this was just what he pro
posed to do.
The witness answered that he thought
his mother had been insane for the last
two years. He testified that she was en
tirely under the Influence of any one who
attempted to control her for any purpose,
even strangers having" no difficulty In
persuading her to sign notes and guar
dianship papers. She had told him that
her property was worth Jll.fflO.flOO and
wanted to (jo to England to secure prop
erty which exists only in her imagination.
Arthur Blair confirmed his brother's
testimony and told of his mother's coming
to San Francisco, where he lives, about
two months ago." In Baroteau's company.
The next morning after they arrived he
was informed by telephone that she wn*
lost and did not know where to go. He
found her alone In a saloon In the west
ern part of the city and Intoxicated.
He argued that the case should be dis
posed of at once as Baroteau had filed a
petition for letters of guardianship In San
Francisco.
Lady Yarde-Buller appeared In court
heavily veiled and attended by her maid
and "Baron", Baroteau.
In opening his case Mr. Fitzgerald said
that the object of his client was to have
Attorney George T. Wright appointed aa
Lady Yarde-Buller's guardian, and that
the appointment was desired by both her
sons, by her sister, who lives in the East,
and by her brother-in-law. Dr. P. L.
Wheeler.
The first -witness called waa Ralph
Blair, Lady Yarde-Buller's older son. He
was asked what he thought of his
mother's mental condition.
Attorney R. M. Fitzgerald In presenting
WÂ« B. Greenebaum's petition to have a
guardian appointed for the person and
estate of Lady Yarde-Buller. before Judge
Ellsworth to-day. Introduced the testi
mony of her Ladyship's sons to show that
ehe is not only incompetent but insane.
He said that he adopted this course In
order to show that the claim of the
"Baron" Baroteau and his attorney, W.
H. Chapman, that Lady Buller is a resi
dent of San Francisco, was a pretense
adopted for the purpose of getting her
away from the jurisdiction of the Ala
meda County courts. But if Â«he -was in
sane, he contended, she was Incompetent
to change her residence, and wa9 there
fore amenable to the decrees of the courts
on this side of the bay.

members of the local Greek colony. J
The banquet last night was in every
way a success. The members and guests
were welcomed by President N. Valianos,

was frequently applauded. The speaker
congratulated "the club upon the progress
which It had made, and urged the mem

Water Front Notes.
The chances now seem to be that .the
British ship Andrada has gone ashote
somewhere on the coast of Vancouver
Island. She left Santa Rosalia on Novem
ber 12 for Oregon and arrived off the Co
lumbia River about three weeks ago.
Pilot Cordiner was put ashore and then
a gale came up and the Andrada was
driven to sea. Since then nothing has
been heard from her, and seafaring men
fear that she was the vessel sighted bot
tom up off Flattery.
The Andrada was a sister ship to the
Andelana and Andorihana. The former
capsized in Tacoma harbor two years ago
and all hands were drowned.. For ten.
months she had lain at anchor awaltinsr
a charter, and just when the contract was
signed and the work of "stiffening" had
begun, she turned turtle during a storm
and went down.
The Andorihana was in the fire that
did so much damage to New York's water
front last year and was almost totally
destroyed. She has been refitted and will
be out here next year. The "Air" line
seems to be playing in hard luck and its
friends are. stilt hoping that the Andrada
will turn up.

EUREKA, Jan. 14.â The steamship Po
mona came Into port to-day with the for
ward part of her guard rail torn off. a
portion of her cabin near the social hall
smashed in and one of her boats broken
in as a result of a collision with the
schooner Fearless about 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon. The schooner was lying
at anchor near Duxbury Reef and a
heavy fog prevented the officers of the
Pomona from seeing the schooner until
the steamship was too close to avoid a
collision. Captain Shea sheered -off as
eoon as he discovered the schooner. This
action resulted in hitting- the Fearless a
glancing blow instead of striking her
amidships as \ ould otherwise have been
the case. On account of the lateness of
the arrival of the Pomona, Agent Baird
has been compelled to change her sailing
time from 7 a. m. to 3 p. m. This acci
dent makes the third the Pomona has
met with within a month. The first was
while she was crossing the bar December
16, when a wave broke in her cabin. The
second resulted irom a severe windstorm,
which forced her on January 3 to take
shelter at the Farallon Islands.
NO NEWS FROM THE ANT>BAT>A.
Big Four-Masted Bark Now Listed
The, Pomona Damaged.
The agents of the vessel put a new deck
load aboard and last Saturday the Fear
less made another start for Guaymaa.
When oft the heads it fell a dead calm
and a dense tog came up. There was ab
solutely no chance to make any headway
and navigation was dangerous, bo tho
Fearless was anchored. Alone came the
Pomona bound for San Francisco from
Eureka and crushed into the schooner, al
most cutting her bow off.
The first news of the disaster was
brought In by the steamer Sequoia. Bha
reported the Fearless five miles off port
â¢with her port bow stove in and BignaUng
for a tusboat. When the schooner camÂ«j
back to port Captain Ldlyquest reported
as follows: . _
"January 13 was lvlngr at anchor five
miles southwest of Bolinas. There was
a dense foe and no wind. We were at
anchor and about 3:40 p. m. we heard a
steamer's signals. The fog horn was go
ing all the time and we did our best to
answer back. We could not cet out of
the way and they could not hear our sig
nals. Suddenly the Pomona loomed up and
the next moment she struck us on the
port bow, cutting through the forecastle
head and to within a few feet of the
water line. _ Â¦
"Captain Shea of tiie Pfmona stayed by
us, and passing a Una began to tow us
back to Ban Francisco. Twice the haw
sers parted, and it was not until 6 p. m.
Sunday that the Feariess was anchored
off the North Bank buoy. Then the Po
mona put about and made a fresh start
for Eureka."
According to Captain LJlvauest the Po
mona is considerably, damaeed and will
have to co on the drydock when she re
turns to San Francisco. The load of lum
ber on the Fearless will be discharged
and that vessel will go on the drydock for
repairs.

now certain that there :a a hoodoo perched
aloft somewhere. In the great southeas
ter she lost all ' her ceckload. and after
being overhauled and reloaded here, she
made another start onlv to be run down
by the steamer Pomona.
On December 9 last the Fearless was
put In commission at Grays Harbor and
made a start for Guaymas with a full load
of lumber. Off the coast of Mendoclno
she was caught In a Kale and over 60,000
feet of lumber was washed away. On
December 29 she .made San Francisco in
distress and the captain reported one of
the roughest times he had ever experi
enced on the coast.

The height of fences to ten feet, so that it
Fhall take effect immediately instead of on
Ju!v 1, 1901, was re-rcfe:red to the Health

Booth in urging: the passape of the ordi
nance represented that the "sky scraping"
lances now permitted to be maintained
are a menace to human life and limb, es
ped&Uy in case of severe storms which
might come at any time. Attorney Pow
ers asked that the matter be re-referred to
the committee, ae the constitutionality of
'he ordinance which goes into effect on
. uly 1. 190L was now on trial before Judge
hfawfll. Tobin opposed the amended ord
inance on the ground that it would be

Appropriation.
NO MONEY FOR
ST. MARY'S PARK
The cases were submitted together, as
they involve three points: That the pro
ceedings in relation to the issuance of the
bonds not having been completed when
the charter went into effect, the Board
of Supervisors had no power to proceed
to issue bonds, as the charter intervened;
secondly, that the bonds in both cases
were invalid because there was no spe
cific declaration of the result of the elec
tion; the third question Is confined to the
panhandle case. The appellant contends
that the proposition to condemn for pub
lic use these Feparate pieces of property
should have been submitted as one thin?,
and that a notice of election for the pan
handle bonds should have specified that
the bonds were payable in a specific kind
of money â gold coin of the United States.
Mr. Fritz was represented by Arthur H.
Rarendt and Charles E. Naylor. Garret
MeEnerney, City and County Attorney
Franklin K. Lane and Assistant City and
County Attorney G. W. Lane represented
the city and county. Briefs in favor of
the bonds were filed by Joseph M. Roths
child. D. C. Murphy and J. C. Chetwood.
In the McHugh case, the attorney for the
appellant is William T. Baggett and the
city and county is represented by Attor
neys MeEnerney, Lane and Lane.
There were two cases bearing on this
vital Question and they were combined in
the arguments, as the questions involved
in each were alike. One of the actions
was that of Eugene N. Fritz against the
city and county of San Francisco, which
involves the validity of the panhandle
bonds, and the other la the suit filed by
Kellx McHugh apraiiiFt the city and coun
ty, which involves the validity of the sew
ers, schoolhouse and hospital bonds. In
both cases demurrers filed by the City
and County Attorney were sustained and
judgment rendered for the city. Appeals
were taken by F.ritz and McHugh and ar
guments were heard yesterday.
Department 1 of the Supreme Court was
crowded yesterday with attorneys, politi
cians and taxpayers who were vitally In
terested in the arguments on the bond
cases which are being heard by the Su
preme Court Fitting In bank. Mayor Phe
lan was an interested listener and other
city and county officials strained their
ears to hoar the reasons Bet forth by
counsel for and against the Issuance of
the bonds.

"This food is the same to a weak stom-
ach as kind words and a gentle touch to
an aching heart. All my doubt and fear
and distress of mind disappeared as soon
as I found a food that I could digest and
whirh relieved my difficulties. Life be-
came brighter and better, my homo a
'ew.ept home.' I have proved conclusive-
ly that the food is realty predigested and
that it if a great nerve and energy build-
er. Of course I can hardly express my
gratitude for the relief I have had."
Kmma Kauffman. Bismarck, Mo.
"Of all the appetizing foods, Grape-
Nuts food is the chief. I was led to
change my diet and take up Grape-Nuts
from the fact that I had a very serious.
long-ptandlngr case of constipation, which
originated from coffee drinking. Constant
heaA&chcz, backaches and a stomach that
felt like lead was the condition: while
the mind was filled with misgivings of
all sorts, and I verily believe I would
have gone lrmanft if It had not been for
the temporary relief from various cures
for constipation, but there seems to be no
permanent relief except In good food like
Graj.Â«e-Nuts*.
*ThÂ«Â» delicious odor that comes when
you pour hot milk or cream over Grape-
Nuts takes one back to childhood and
the wide, golden harvest fields when the
wind blew in your face the scent of rlp-
c-ned irrain and made you oh, so hungry!

BERKELEY, Jan. 14.-Editor F. M. Al
len and Manacer F. E. Reed of the Call
fornian, the student papÂ«r, are having?
trouble with their former publisher. B. F.
Arnold, the manager Â»f the Gazette Pub
lishing Company. Yesterday Arnold had
everything in readiness to print the Cali
fornian. He 'left the staff of the college
paper in charge of his office and when
he returned the members of the staff had
disappeared, taking with them all of the
advertising, cuts from, their paper. To
day the 'Callfornian made its appearance
from an Oakland printing office." -
Last Ausust Arnold made a year con
tract with J.-W.-S. BullÂ«r,- then manasrer
of the Callfornian. It was under this con
tract that he expected to print tue col
lege paper this term.
"We do not wish, to make 'any trouble
for the. boys," said Mr. ~ Arnold, "but we
believe we could hold them under the con
tract. - I -have consulted a lawyer, but
nothing will -be done until , Butler returns
to college next week.".
Editor Allen declares that the cuts tak
en belonged, to the staff. and they did not
exceed their risht. Tho members. of; the
staff acknowledge that they have broken
their contract with Arnold, but they hold
that he has \ done ' the same thinp ; many
times before.
Arnold had nearly a galley of type Â«et
up â¢ before - he : knew_ of - the change. lie
had senufor a force of men to complete
the work.

The Home for the Adult Blind at Te
mescal is now In better condition than for
many years, and if the present Legisla
ture srant s- the modest demands of this
Institution Superintendent banders ex
pects to have an actual surplus to the
credit of the factory In place of the $S0O0
deficit which he found there when he took
charge less than two years ago. During
Mr .Sanders' former term he had a fund
of $5000 to the credit of the factory, all
made from- the profits of broom-making.
When Mr. Sanders took charge he found
that there was a deficit of $3000. The last
Legislature met $6000 of this deficit, and
Mr. Sanders will ask the present Legisla
ture lo make up the balance, in or
der tRat the Institution -may start even.
No deficit has occurre.i during the present
management, and the $2000 appropriation
to be asked for will bo applied upon old
bills contracted under a former adminis
tration. Of these bills 11631 27 is for mer
chandise furnished the Home and $470 40
is for salaries.
In order that the shop at the' Home
might be opened and work provided, Su
perintendent Sanders secured broom corn
to the amount of $3450 upon his own per
sonal credit. This was donÂ© In order to
save the increasing 1 market value of the
corn to the Home. Superintendent San
ders will also ask the Legislature to ratify
this action, and pay for the corn, as It has
resulted in a great saving for the State.
Broom Corn_ Purchased Upon Per
sonal Credit Tliat Will
Save Much, to the
State.
Legislature Will BÂ» Asked
to Meet an Old
Deficit.

TAKEN TO A MISSION
AGAINST HER WILL
Young Chinese Woman, Dragged
From Her Home, Declares Police
Acted Without Warrant.
Quite a little excitement was Â» caused
among the Mongolian residents of Sulli
van alley shortly after 5 o'clock yesterday
afternoon by the forcible carrying off of
Tew Tow, a handsome young Chinese
woman from her home. Corporal Anthony
and Policeman Ben Kaskell, who Is bailiff
in Judge Conlan'e ' court, entered the
woman's room and told her she must go
with them to the Washington-street mis
sion. When she objected the offlcerÂ» took
hold of her and tried to force her along.
The woman lay on the floor 'and made a
strong resistance, crying to the men to
show her a warrant for her arrest and
promising to go peaceably If they pro
duced authority.
Yee was finally taken from the hou3e,
but when she reached the street she fought
Â¦ vigorously, kicking and biting- the bfflcer3
in her vain effort to release- herself. To
her friends he declared that the officers
were kidnaping her and were acting with
out warrant. She said that she was 20
years of age and was being taken from
her home agratnst her -win. All the way
to the mission she fought and struggled,
yelling at the top of her voice and de
nouncing the action of the mission peo
ple and the unlawful methods of tha po
lice. The woman was taken to the mis
sion, where she kept up an incessant pre
test. No record of her arrest was made
at the City Prison. .
MILLINERS DISAGREE
AND SPLIT FOLLOWS
Many Walk Out of Meeting at Which
! j;*^~ -Â¦'. It Is Decided to Form a .
/ .. Union.
A union or not a union was the per
plexing problem which was troubling the
brains of the fair milliners of this city,
and it proved a rock upon- which they split
last night. They are unanimous in their
desire to have the milliner stores close 'at
6 o'clock, but some of- them hesitate and
become extremely ".timid when | they see
the. possibility- of a dreadful strike loom
ing up before them. At the meeting last
night the matter was discussed in a very
stormy manner. Â¦ .
Two ; factions arose â the unionists and
the , non-unionists. The former agitated
the : imm"edlate formation, of. a union and
affiliation with the federation of unions,
Â¦whlle-the latter thought the storekeepers
would accede to- their demands without
the necessity of taking any such drastic
measures. The unionists, who were well
organized " under the \ leadership - of Mrs.
Reynolds,'. finally, carried. their point, and
the'lr opponents withdrew from tho meet-
Ing Â¦'-'A union was formed and Mrs. Bessie
Collins was elected president. J. D. Pierce
and. wife of the American. Federation or
Labor 'were present and addressed the
meeting on the alms and advantages of
the labor union. Â¦ :

and this fact saved him from the wrath
of Kendall. â¢ -
â¢ Trewella was 54 years old and had been
engaged In the hotel and restaurant busi
ness in this city and 'the State for many
years. . Mrs. j Trewella will return to the
cky this morning.
Â©Robert E. Glaze was again interviewed
late last evening. At first he was reticent
about the affair. He claimed that he was
â¢advised by his attorney not to make any
statement. He later claimed that he was
forced to the act In self-defense.
" "Trewella was coming for me like a
mad bull," he said. "He had an ugly, look
In his eye, and I am sure he made a mo
tion to draw a gun on me. I shot him,
and I did it clearly in self-defensq. I hear
that. they found no gun on him. but that
is not improbable, as the Morgue officials
did not take his body away until twenty
minutes after ho was shot. Trewella
handled my wife roughly last night; he
took her by the shoulders and shook her
roughly. I had to kill him or he would
have killed me."
Miss May Shelley, stepdaughter of
Glaze, said last night that Mrs. Glaze re
fused to be interviewed. When asked If
Trewella had ever annoyed her mothe*
she answered in the affirmative/ All other
questions she refused to answer. ; .â¢ :
Glaze is well known in this city. Ho
was employed at the Baldwin Hotel for
some years as night clerk and also as
day clerk. Alter the Baldwin Hotel was
destroyed by fire Glaze went to the Ha
waiian Islands ana ran a hotel there for
some time. He was born near Dallas;
Polk County, Oregon, where his mother
and sisters' still reside. .Twenty years ago
the Glaze : family became involved In a
feud with. a family named Whitney and
two of the Whltneyswere killed/It was
alleged, by Till Glaze: an elder brother
of the man who shot 'his partner yester
day. Till Glaze afterward met a violent
death in Oklahoma. ,. . .
am locked up. everything- taken from my
pockets and charged with murder."
Glaze then asked if it was . really true
that Trewella was dead, and when . in
formed that his partner was no more.
Glaze said:
"Well. I am sorry for him, but it could
not be helped."
Oscar Tolle. clerk in Superior Judge
Carroll Cook's court, who Is an old friend j
of Glaze, hastened to the prison when
he learjicd that Glaze was charged with
murder. Glaze informed Tolle that he had
shot Trewella in self-defense, and, when
asked by Tolle what, caused the shooting
stated that "Trewella lnld hands on my
wife last night." Neither the accused
man nor his wife would make any state
ment yesterday as to what offense . Tre-.
wella had been guilty. .
The Chinese cook of the Windsor Hotel,
Ah Jim, was a few feet away from the
spot of the tragedy at the time, it oc
curred, but the Celestial claimed that he
heard no words pass between his employ
ers. All he knew of the affair was that
he heard the shots fired." Â¦ . .
George Deal and John Porter, employes
of the hotel, were in the saloon directly
over the bakery, where the shooting hap
pened. They said that they heard four
shots fired, bufheard no quarrel between
Trewella and Glaze. Miss Amanda Â¦ Lar
sen, who was in the laundry which ad
joins the kitchen, claims- that she heard
only the sound of shots. ' ' ' .
A number of the employes of the hotel
Informed the police after the murder that
they had heard- the sound of 'firing, but
could throw but little light on. the trag
edy.. ' ' . . - Â¦ . â¢: . '.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Trewella went
to Auburn, and some of her friends as
sert that her journey, was for, the pur
pose of raising â¢ money, as her husband
desired to buy Glaze's Interest In the ho
tel. They also say that Mrs. Trewella
frequently told them that . her husband
had never drawn a cent out: of the re
ceipts of the hotel, and that each month
he was obliged to draw upon 'his- own
funds for his expenses. It Is known .that
during the last week Trewellai with the
aid of Night Clerk Heaney, had made an
investigation of the books, and'that' Glaze
only a few days ago learned of Trewella's
acticn. - "â¢ '. ; '*
Frank L. Seavler, an employe of the
Gas Consumers' Association, who boards
at 'the Windsor Hotel, stated last night
that he was the first to reach Trewella
after the shooting. H?. tried to lift the
dying man, who exclaimed, "My God, he
has killed me." Shortly afterward the
doctors arrived and Trewella died without
uttering another word. .
The statement of the bellboy O'Connor
is fully borne out by the location of the
bullet wounds on Trewella's body. The
door of the bakery is to the left of the
stairs leading from the kitchen, and it is
evident that the first bullet fired by Glaze
struck his victim in the left arm; the sec
ond bullet entered the left shoulder blade'
as Trcwella reeled with his back toward
his murderer, who then flred a third bullet
into the spine of Trewella. As-the.In
jured man sank to the floor two more
shots were fired, which entered the chest
Just below the breastbone and perforated
the stomach. The powder burns . on
Trewella's shirt front show â¢ Â¦: that the
murderer mustvhave held .his - weapon
at close range. *
Detectives Cody and McCann, who were
detailed' by Captain Seymour to work on
the case, learned last night that a serious
quarrel had taken place on Sunday [even-
Ing ; between Mrs. Â¦ ; Glaze . ; and ; j Mrs.
Trewella.' â¢ Mrs. Glaze, it is said," went ; to

to have been the basis, of Glaze's, state

THE SLAYER, HIS WIFE AND THE VICTIM IN THE TRAGEDY WHICH
WAS KNACTED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON IN THE KITCHEN OF
THE WINDSOR HOTEL.
The Supreme Court opened its January
calendar yesterday and listened all day to
arguments in many now celebrated cases.
The appeal; of Cordelia Botkin. the
wpman who .was convicted Â¦ of poisoning:
Mrs. John P. Dunning and her sister, was
arguAl and submitted. Attorney General
Tirey.L. Ford appeared in behalf of the
people and replied to the address de
livered by Charles Heggerty, counsel for
appellant. The argument of Mr. Heg
gerty was ' â¢' devoted solely, to the point
that there was an insufficiency of evidence
to warrant a conviction. The Attorney
General confessed error in this case, as he
did in the Brandos case, which also came
up for hearing.
When the Brandes case was called by
Chief Justice Beatty, the Attorney Gen
eral admitted that error had been com
mitted" by the lower court.' Attorney F.
W." Sawyer of Oakland, attorney for the
man/ who was convicted of choking and
beating his 14-year-old daughter to death,
Informed the court that the evidence was
insufficient to convict his client. He said
he hoped to secure a dismissal of the case
by the lower court and thereby save the
county of Alameda flvo. or six thousand
dollars for prosecuting another trial.
'The "case was' ordered placed at the
foot of to-day's calendar."

CORDELIA BOTKIN
SEEKS NEW TRIAL
his victim and opened fire on him at close
range from behind a door without a word
of warning. The fact that no weapon was
found on the dead man bears out the
theory that it was a brutal, premeditated
murder. The motive for the crime is j
somewhat obscure, but from remarks |
dropped by Glaze may have been fancieo
insults offered to Mrs. Glaze.
O'Connor, when first questioned by the
police shortly after the murder, pretend
ed to know nothing of the shooting, but
when taken before Captain of Detectives
Seymour last night admitted that he wil
ressed the shooting and then made the
following statement, explaining that his
assumed ignorance when first, questioned
was because he feared to talk:
"I was on duty in the afternoon," said
O'Connor, "when I answered a call to room
27 and was asked to get some drinks from
the bar. The bar is situated up a flight
of stairs in the interior open court of the
hotel. I went to the bar and the bar
keeper told me that he had no limes and
requested me to go and ask Mr. Trewella
for some. The barkeeper told me that
Mr Trewella had just gone downstairs
with Mr. Glaze. I went to the kitchen,
which Is right under the barroom, and
saw Mr. Trewella inside.
"I did not see Mr. Glaze around. I told
Mr. Trewella what I wanted and he asked
me to go with him to the storeroom and
he would give me the limes. Mr. Trewella
vrent ahead and I followed him from tho
kitchen. There are three steps which
lead down from the kitchen to the level
of the interior court and the storeroom
is opposite the kitchen door.
"As Mr. Trewella had just started down
the steps of the kitchen the first thing I
knew was that Mr. Glaze was near the
steps and was firing at Mr. Trewella. I
was so scared that I cannot remember
how many shots were fired. I know that
as Mr. Trewella sank to the ground Mr. j
Glaze was still firing his pistol.
"Then Glaze went into the bakery and
went right around the kitchen and came
up behind me, having gone through an
other door. He said to me, 'If any one
asks you how he was shot, you say that
he shot himself." Glaze then walked away
and I tried to help Mr. Trewella up, but
I W2.s unable to do so. Then I went into
the hotel and soon afterward the police
and doctors arrived."
Trewella and Glaze had been in part
nership for ten months, both men be
ing married and having stepchildren. Tho
two families resided in the hotel. As far
as is known, Trewella and Glaze hav^
been on most friendly terms, and the
shooting came as a surprise to all the at
taches of the hotel.
A few minutes before 2 p. m. yesterday,
Trewella and Glaze wore scon in the lobby
of the hotel, apparently engaged in friend
lj* conversation.
The two men proceeded to the rear of
the lobby and passed out into the Interior
open court of the building and ascended
to the saloon, which is situated over the
kitchen and bakery of the hotel.
After taking a drink in the saloon, Tro
wella and Glaze went downstairs and en
tered the bakery, which adjoins the kitch-
In a few minutes the sounds of pistol
shots startled the guests and attaches of
the hotel, and several of them saw Glaze
as he was walking away from the body
of his victim. He appeared cool and calm
ly ejected the exploded shells from his re
vclver and started to reload the weapon.
As he entered the office of the hotel. Al
bert Shelley, Glaze's stepson, who, was on
duty, wrenched the revolver from his
hand and cursed him. He then told him
to give himself up to the police. Glaze
did as he was told, and surrendered- to
Police Officers N. J. Barry and D. J. Drls
coll at the corner of Eddy and Market
streets.
"I have shot my partner, Trewella.,
said Glaze to the officers, to whom he was
known, "and I want to give myself up.
We have often had trouble about domestic
and business affair? and he threatened mo
many times. A little while ago he came
toward me in a threatening manner and
made a motion as if to pull a weapon. I
thought he had a gun, bo I pulled my pis
tol and shot him."
Glaze was taken to the Southern station,
from which place he was conveyed to the
Hall of Justice.
As soon as the shooting was known to
the employes of the Windsor -Hotel, ur
gent calls were sent for physicians, as
Trewella was still aUve. Dr. F. A, Mc-
Mahon, 230 Turk street, and Dr. G. W.
O'Donnell responded. They hastily exam
ined Trewella and found that he was be
yond human aid, as two of the bullets had
entered the stomach. While the doctors
were cxamlnine Trewella the wounded
man gave a gasp and <Qied.
The newsof the shooting spread rapidly
and a large crowd congregated in front
of the hotel, requiring the presence of a
number of policemen to keep the sidewalk
clear. The Coroner's deputies soon ar
rived and searched Trewella's body, but
no weapon was found on it, a few papers,
$2 in money ajid some keys being all that
was in the pockets of the dead man.
The policemen and Detective Cody ex
amined the pistol with which the shootinjr
had been done and- found one new car
tridge in it. A careful search of the bak
ery revealed the presence of five empty
Phells, and It is evident that Glaze, after
firing all the bullets from his pistol, had
ejected the empty cartiidges and put in
a single shell. Just why Glaze did this he
declines to state.
Soon after being conveyed to the Hall
of Justice, Glaze sent for his attorney,
I. I. Brown, and for Mrs. Glaze. He sat
in the lobby of the prison and talked
earnestly with his wife and his attorney. ;
"I had to kill that man," said the pris
oner to a reporter for The Call; "that is all
I can say. I know that is a serious state
ment to make, but either I had to kill
him or he would have killed me.: I cannot
say any more now, as my attorney has
advised me to say nothing. This is a
serious position for me to bÂ« In. wÂ«rÂ« I

minutes before 2 o'clock yesterday after

The shooting occurred in the kitchen of
the hotel 'and Trewella's body was liter

up to the police, claiming he had killed
his partner in self-defense, but accord

John J. O'Connor, a bellboy, and the only

Question â Don't you consider the
transport Grant seaworthyP
Answer â I most -assuredly do not.
It is a rattletrap. The only .thing
that is good about this ship is the
iron hull which is below the super
structure. Captain Buford.said "An
other trip and she will fall apart."
She is leaky all over the decks and
she is very weakly constructed above
the main deck- If a good eza should
ever strike the ship, such as we might j
expect, she would go to pieces. We j
have nsver seen any bad weather yet. j
Captain Baker â If this ship is un- j
seaworthy I want to know it.
Captain Scheller â Well, she is; I
tell you right now. I
The foregoing is an extract from the
testimony of Captain John F. Seheller.
sailing master of the Grant, during an
Investigation by Lieutenant Colonel j
Marion P. Maus, inspector greneral. U. S.
V.. as to the condition of the Government
transport Grant. Captain Seheller said
further that the whole deck was leaky
ac<J that it was impossible to prevent it.
Captain Baker, in charge of the Grant,
denied that he had ever received a report
from any one that the ship was unsea
Â¦worthy.
The following is an extract from the re
port of Captain Seheller to the depart
ment: *
X have repeatedly pointed out to the trans
port Quartermaster the necessity of Riving the
â¢hip a thorough overnaullnK. as la my opinion
the is In bad condition and consequently unfit
for sea. This rebuilding ha* been postponed
from one trip to another. When I relieved
Captain Buford as matter of the Grant I asked
blm about the condition of the ship. His an
swer was. "If the ship makes another trip Â»he
may fall to pieces." This i6. of course, an
exaggeration, as the hull below the main deck
is la good condition, but above this, including
the upper structure and decks, she is In bad
condition and in rainy weather or in a seaway
â¢.Â»â¢Â¦ epar, main, saloon and promenade decks
end the living quarters located there are leak
ing and much complaint has been made to that
effect.
It was a general opinion that the Grant
would have been laid up on the completion of
voyajre No. Z and Captain Baker requested me
stNapasaki to see Co'cnel Hyfie, the quarter
master thPre. to tell him that tlie ship would
be good for another trio. Against my better
judgment and to plea.-* Captain Baker and to
ovoid any unpleafamiiiss 1 did tell Colonel
Hyde that the ehip could make another trip,
which the did under fortunate conditions. The |
ship may run for year:-, but should she ever I
encounter heavy weather The would be in great
danger, due to the structural weakness of the
upper portions of the vessel.
I respectfully submit the foregoing statement
Cor jour consideration, trusting that it will
receive fair and impartial treatment.
This report was supplemented by a let
ter under date of January 11 from John
Barneson. Marine Superintendent of the
Army Transixirt 'Service, demanding an
investigation as to its truth or falsity. In
that letter Captain Barneson said:
I have the honor to report that Captain J.
F. Schiller, master of the United States array
transport Grar.l. while under oath in an in
vestigation recently made by Colonel Maus.
United State* army inspector peneral. Depart
ment of California, stated that the Grant, of
which he was then master, was unseaworthy.
a rattle-trap and unfit to go to sea. I would
respectfully request investigation of this state
ment. The vessel If running under certificate (
prar.ted by your offlc*-. Captain Schelier has
never reported to me anything that would war
rant the statement made by him tinder oath,
and as I understand it to be his duty to im
mediately report to you anything of so grave
iinprrtance with his vessel I respectfully re
quest that investigation be made, and If it is
found that there is any defect in this vessel
that a thorough reinspectlon be made by your
effice before the vessel sails again.
The matter was thereupon taken up by
Captain John Bermlngham, Supervising
InFpector. First District. With that
promptitude and decision which have com
mended the captain to the favorable
notice ai the department at Washington,
he proceeded to the transport yesterday
morning" and, made a personal Investiga
tion. In attendance, in obedience to his
summons, there were present Captain
Seheller; Captain John Barneson, super-
Intending engineer; J. H. Humphreys, as
sistant superintendent; C. J. Brugiere,
flrst officer; Jonah Sidley, chief engineer;
Captain Baker, quartermaster U. S. A..
tnd W. Murphy, second officer. After
making a careful survey of the ship and
?xsmlntag: all the parties the Supervising
Inspector retired to his office and pre
pared the following decision:
Captain John Barneson, Marine Superintend
ent, U. B. A- T. 6.. San Francisco, Cal.â Bir:
Tour letter cf the 11th lnst to the United
States local Inspectors for this district relative
to the rexxMt of Captain J. F. Bcheller, late
zsaster of the Cnltad 8tatÂ«s army transport
Orarst, alleging under oaxh before Colonel
Marion P. Maus, inspector general, U. 8. V.,
at army headquarters here the unseaworthiness
of the United States army transport Grant,
kas been referred to me by that board for my
action.
I bet leave to state in regard, to the allega
tions of the said Captain Seheller in his tes
timony recently given before Colonel Maus/
that, upon personal Investigation made by two
special visits to thÂ« Grant on the 12th and
14th lnets.. I find the condition of that vessel
to be about the eame as she had been ever
eincÂ« her arrival on this 'toast: her hull, boilers
and machinery are all In good condition.
There are practically continuous lines of
butts IB the plank of the spar deck extending"
from her hatches to the side or the vessel,
made Â»? by shutting In former gangways to
eald hatches. These butts leak a little during
heavy weather, caused, no doubt, by the vibra
tion of the forebody of the ship. Incident to
the action of the propellers in all screw steam
ers ana occasionally a very little water gets
Into a few of her fctaterooms during heavy
weather. All these leaks can be minimised. If
not entirely stopped, by a little vigilance on
the part of the officers of the vessel. None
of the water from said leaks can pass down
into the hold of the vessel, but rather passes
out through the scuppers leading from the main
deck, and In no way Jeopardizes the safety of
the veesel or the lives of her passengers or
crew.
From what I learn from the deck oflJcers of
the Grant I am convinced that the sweeping
allegations of Captain Seheller as to the
Grant's beir.e: a "rattle-trap" and "unsea
worthy" were only fig-tires of speech, without
Justification, which he has since practically
admitted to me. ,
Ai to Scheller's feart about the safety of
the Grant In her present condition should she
encounter heavy weather I have only to say
that the transport Sherrran, a duplicate of the
Orant in every particular, lately encountered
a typhoon in the Western Pacific and shipped
a heavy pea. escaping with some damare to
her boat* and the joiner work of the houses on
her promenade deck.
Had Captain Seheller covered with canvas
the lraky butts "f the ppar dock of the Grant,
p.* of don* en the Sherman, which could have
been done by his carpenters in a single day.
he would have performed a simple duty that
would have aiided to the comforts of his pas
rencere.
Taklnr nil things Into consideration I con
sider the Grant Is now to all Intents and pur
pows In a seaworthy condition. Refr>ectfully.

IS THE SOURCE
OF MUCH EVIL
Rabbi "v'oorsanger AdvccatiS
Ita Removal From the
Limits of City.
Municipal League Appoints Commit
tee to Ask Police Commissioners
to Concentrate Celestials
in One District.
The subject of the "social evil waa
taken up again last night for discussion
by the Municipal League. The Rev. Dr.
Voorsanger, who has made a careful
study of the matter, gave it as his opin
ion that Chinatown Is the great moral
cancer of tne city.
"If it was possible to remove China
town," said he. "San Francisco would be
the most moral city on earth. With this
plague spot removed we would have but
little to complain of from the standpoint
cf morality. True, there would be other
evils to contend with, but they could be
regulated. The luxury of our modern
times has too strongly operated on u e
imaginations of our poor. Hunger Is the
grcau!3t ar.aichlst in the world. When
hunger Ftall:s abroad those who do not
wish to die sell themselves for bread.
"We must treat this evil with great ptty
for the victims of the social conditions
we have created. Treat it as we may, I
will never agiee to licensing that which
}s evil. I am opposed, bitterly opposed
to licensing any evil, for no government
hus the right tc make money out of that
which morality forbids. I am opposed 10
licensing objectionable houses the same as
I am opposed to high license as a rem
edy for the liquor traffic. It is wrong
to sell liquor, the Government has no
right to license the business at all. To
licence any of our social evils, is Just aa
bad as if we were to take hush money.
If a thing is wrong, let us condemn it,
but never make it a source of revenue for
the soveriiiutui. 1 am not in favor or
drastic iiicasuits. however. 1 will never
consent to making object lessons of Â«ie
unfor^jn ii'i women in our midst, unt 1
the gambling houses on Ktarny street,
the pawnshops on Market street ana tae
gilded palaces and underground dives are
removed. The great is that our
business men like theories, and become
frightened almost to death when you
present them with facts. As the first step
toward removing the social evil, 1 favor
the condemning of Chinatown and Its re
moval to a site selected near Lake MerÂ«
ced. I am more afraid of Chinatown than
of our fallen women, drunkards and gam
blers. We can deal with the latter ,
classes, but it seems from present out
looks to be impossible to deal with China
town. Let us first remove Chinatown and
then we can easily deal with the rest."*
Irving Davis, who followed, spoke at
length on the evils that existed, both be
fore and after the Parkhurst crusade in
New York City.
Isidor Jacobs favored the concentration
of the evil in ono section of the city.
Rev. Dr. Scott agreed with Dr. Voor
sanger in many of his views, but did not i
think that the removal of Chinatown |
would noticeably purify the moral air of
the city.
"I do not think it practical to remove
Chinatown," said Colonel J. C. Currier,
"for so many influential people are de
riving revenue from It that any such
project must meet with strong opposition.
I believe that the classes complained of
should be put in one section of the city
and quarantined."
"The evil can bo minimized," said
Supervisor Braunhart, "but to what ex
tent depends upon the honesty of the of
flcialb. In the past the unfortunate crea
tures have been subject to blackmail.
They have- been blackmailed by officials
elected to execute the laws. I do not
think it right to license the evils of the
ojty and that is what it practically
amount3 to If arrests are to be periodical
ly made, with the understanding that tho
offenders are to pay light fines*. If our of
ficials not accept bribes and levy black
mail, but instead carry out the lawsnow
exacted, we will soon remedy the social
At the conclusion of the discussion the
league appointed Messrs. Jacobs. Rea.
Schlesslnger. Greensfelder and Henderson
to appear before the Police Commission
ers and endeavor to bring about arrange
ments to concentrate the evil in a section
of the city set aside for that purpose.
