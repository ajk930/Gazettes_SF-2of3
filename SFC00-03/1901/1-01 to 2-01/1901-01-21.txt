. The facts given to-night place the ill
ness of the venerable Queen in a start
ling and pathetic light. They show that
her mind has been falling for some time.
Even'before her visit to Ireland she had
been a mental wreck for months. When
ever it was officially announced that- she
made felicitous responses to speeches at
public functions It Is a matter of cold
fact that, the poor old Queen was in such
a daze that all she could say to her com
panions was: "Where am I?" . Several
times when she appeared in public during
the past - six * or eight : months I she haa
fallen asleep. Had It been any one else
but. the Queen. of England it would have
been' plain long ago that 'her malady was
senile decay. And that, truthfully, is
what afflicts Victoria. But 'for her phys
ical breaking up . of the past: week, an
attack of paralysis; in , the left side, it
would have j been | possible for the : court
and the royal household to have kept
from the British people knowledge of her
mental decay for an Indefinite period.
For the Queen had lapses of Intellectual
vigor, . but these were more - distressing
to her than her periods of mental density
When her Â¦ brain j was clear she immedi
ately reverted to the horrors of the. war
in South Africa. Again and again she

which has been cabled to the WÂ° r ld dur

the Queen's illness. ;<: y::. >^;'- ; -v
"The prayers of the congregation are
asked for tier Majesty, the Queen, the
condition of whose health is . a cause of
anxiety and sorrow to us all. "We pray
that by God's help her Majesty's recovery
may be speedy and complete."
The Dean of St. George's Chapel, Wind
sor, read the prayer for a sick person
when there is little hope of recovery, be
ginning: "For as much In all appear
ances, the time of her dissolution draw
etji near."
The following notice was read In the
Roman Catholic Pro-Cathedral at Kings
ton:
In churches of all denominations pray
ers were offered at the morning services,
and in most of them the latest bulletin
regarding the Queen's condition waÂ» read.
The chief rabbi resquested special pray
ers.
The rumors that the Marquis of. Salis
bury and the Archbishop of Canterbury
had been summoned to Osborne House
were Incorrect.
During the day the members of the
diplomatic corps and other notable per
sons entered their names in the visitors'
book at Buckingham Palace.
Emperor William stepped out of a sa
loon carriage wearing a traveling suit.
He saluted the Prince of Wales by kiss
ing him on both cheeks, and the Prince
returned a similar salutation. He then
embraced the Duke of York and shook
hands with the others. The people who
looked on as the carriages drove off un
covered their heads, and Emperor Wil
liam and the Prince of Wales acknowl
edged the courtesy by removing their
hats. No cheers broke the mournful si-;
lence. The crowd in the vicinity of Buck
ingham Palace maintained the same de
meanor when the Emperor and \ the
Prince of Wales retired togeher. At 10
p. m. the Prince . began a conversation
with Osborne House which "lasted nearly
an hour. As a result of this the Em
peror and Prince decided to start for Os

were given that a royal yacht should txj

Isle of Wight.
the train entered the station. The Duke
of Tork. Prince Christian. Prince Albert
of Schleswlg-Holstein and Prince Arthur
of Connaught completed the group of roy
al personages.
LOTvDON. Jan. 21.â Throughout
the United Kingdom yester
day (Sunday) was one of
anxiety and suspense. No
one in England, outside the
circle of the court, knew the
real condition of the Queen
or the nature of her disease.
XiOnflon newspapers had not learned that
her Majesty had suffered a stroke of par
aJysis. Extra editions of the Sunday pa
pers contained no Information, but there
werÂ« many of the official bulletins and
they were eagerly bought.
There were small gathering in the vicin
ity of Buckingham Palace and Marlbor
ough House, as well as other centers
where the bulletins were posted. Crowds
assembled to witness the arrival of Em
percr William. Apart from such incidents,
however, the customary quiet of a Lon
don Sunday was not disturbed.
The most alarming reports of the day
came in the form of telegrams from the
Princesses at Osborne House. The com
ing of Emperor William and the news that
King LÂ»eopold was about starting for Lon
don Inspired fears that death was at hand.
On the other hand, the fact that the
Prince of Wales was able to leave Os
borne House had an encouraging effect.
When the Prince arrived at Victoria sta
tion, London, at 4 o'clock with Sir Francis
Knollys attending, several hundred peo
pie were there to greet him. But there
was no demonstration beyond a respectful
raising of hats. The Earl of Clarendon
and the Earl of Pembroke received the
Prince. When they inquired regarding the
Queue's condition, he replied: Â¦
"You see they have let me come away."
The Government had arranged to send
the fast cruiser Minerva to bring Emperor
William, but he embarked on a mail pack
et before he learned of the plans, being
accompanied by the Duke of Connaught.
The steamer had a. rough passage and
on entering fiheemess harbor she .went
by the warships â¢without any ceremonies.
Admiral Kennedy and Count von MIrbach,
of the German Embassy, received the Em
peror and escorted him to a special wait
ing room.
Two hours before ' his Majesty's train
was due in London, people began to gather
about Charing Cross etatlon-The crowd
Included not only the usual hangers-on,
but many fashionable people and hundreds
of Germans, anxious to see the Emperor
on his first appearance in London in years.
The throng became bo large that the
authorities erected wooden barriers and
a hundred of the tallest police of the Met
ropolitan force, with squads of mounted
men. lined up the people on the streets,
forming a lane for two blocks to Nelson's
monument In Trafalgar Square. Through
this lane moved a procession of royal car
riages, each bearing two footmen in yel
low liveries behind. The carriages entered
the railway station and drew up near the
track.
The Prince of Wales arrived Just before

Only after this was done was the. girl
Queen at liberty to go and finish her tnilf t
and talk over her changed fortune with
her beloved mother. At nine, homnr,
she had to see the Prime Minister, and
at eleven her first council was held. The
crowds of peers and high officials who
came to that council Â¦was almost Incred
ible, for all were curious to see how the
young girl, of whose Inner nature so little
was known, would demean herself. Ens
land had aeen wom^n mnunt the throne
before, but then they had never been .*o
young. Even Mr. Orfvllle. present on thl=Â»
occasion, and who has left behind him .in
acid diary In which he abuses most
things, has only words of praise to b<
stow. The simp!* dignity with which she
went through the Ions ordeal of this mul
titude of men swearing allegiance an-i
kissing her hand, the charm of voice a~d.
delivery with which she read her first
speech/earner! her the praise of all pres
ent. Indeed, the beauty of her voice. U>e
clearness of her enunciation in public,
speaking, have ever been a thrme of
praise. When her aged uncles knelt to drÂ»
her homage she was visibly affected and
blushed up to the eyes, as though she felt
the contrast between their civil and natu
ral relations. But this was the only sfga
of emotion she evinced..
Xext day the ceremony of proclamation
took place, when, -according to custom,
the Queen had to appear at the open win
dow of the Presence Chamber In St.
James' Palace, surrounded by her great
nobles in their state robes. She herself.
and her mother, who stood beside her.
were simply dressed in mourning. Vflovr
were heralds and trumpeters ready to pro
claim to all men: "ThÂ« King la dead!
l.or.s live the Queen!" Hundreds of gruiiS
repeated the record, and loud acclama
tions from the populace rent the at-. Th<s
last " sovereigns had not gained lbs love
or esteem of the people; it wns hoped,
and not in vain, that this new ruter wot:!*
prove more constitutional, and would ob-
Hteratrs all unhappy recollectlon3.
One result of the Queen's accsaslon ivaa
that the connection of the English crown
with Hanover, so hated by the English
people, and which in later tines* woulu
have drawn the country Into continental
troubles, was severed, since In th;u little
kingdom the Eallc law was In fore*. Th>>
crown was therefore assumed ry . th*
Queen's uncle, the unpopular Duka c
Cumberland.

Duke Not a Favorite; Â¦} j
It seems strange that this should have
been the case with a royal Prince, but
the Drke was no favorite with his fam
ily, and, mofeovr. jealousy and Hl-feel
lns of all-kinds- were rife among the royal
brothers of England on account of this
expected child, each desiring to be the.
father of the future sovereign. For. not
withstanding the fact that George III.
and his, royal spouse. Queen Charlotte,
had been most prolific, the younger mem
bers of the family were few. The long
continental war and . the royal marriage
,act passed by the King himself had kept
the younger princes unmarried till they
were middle-aged men. The heir to the
throne In those davs was first George,
Prince of Wales,. for some time Regent,
owing to his father's Insanity, and then
hia only daughter Charlotte, who In 1S15
married Leopold., afterwards Klng'of the
Belgians. Bu * when In the winter of 1S17
Princess Charlotte was laid In eternal
rest, her still-born infant in her arms, it
was perceived with consternation .that
there was no young heir to the throne.
Immediately the royal princes who were
still unmarried hurried to look around
them for suitable connections, and early
the next year the Dukes of, Clarence,
Kent and Cambridge married three prin
cesses. Indeed, the two former were mar
ried on the same day. .The Duke of Kent,
however, had stolen a march upon his
brother, for. he had a> few montha previ
ously married his bride In. Germany, the
English ceremony being merely a formula
to render yet more . legal the possible
fruit of the union. For all these men were
far aflva need In the fifties; had led disci
puted lives and offspring was no certainty.
Th* Duke of Kent was by far th* best
and most, moral of the- royal princes;
though it can scarcely be said .that he was
! popular. He had not : been ..a -favorite
child with his parents, and had thus per
haps escaped, the evil effects of court flat
tery and home Indulgence. His, leanings
were Liberal â nt that;tlmÂ« an object of
loathing to Â¦ rayojty,- and on. this account
tie was cut off with a. niggardly allowance
quite unfitting his rank. His tastes were
continental rather than Englishâ another
cause for unpopularity, the nation In
those days having a -great distaste for
everything 'not Insular.' The coarseness
cf the age preferred the home-bred ex
travagances and even vices of his broth
ers to his more' decorous and moral con
duct. It was therefore not quite seen with
favor that he : might be the father of the
future sovereign. And, indeed, the' Duke
of Clarence, his elder, who had forestalled
hlm.by.a'few weeks In becoming- a father,"
might yet have other children.. though. his
baby had died erethe Duke of Kent's saw
the.: light. Still, 'when his own little
daughter^ was : born, ''the 'Duke regarded
her.'hlgh destiny as such a settled thing
that he ,was..wont to hold In -hi*
arms and say: "Look^at" her well:" she
will yet be Queen of ; England."- -And, in
deed, the sickly; Clarence . Princess ;' who"
followed her sister also faded in : baby-'
hood Into "an early grave. , ': >
Â¦ .Birth. of the "May Blossom."
"It-was when thÂ« horsechestnut trees." for
which Kensington Gardens -are,; famous,'

no small national moment;; It was to Inau

Yet when Â¦ those [ blue : eyes \ first Â¦ opened ' to
the light of day \ matters^lboked 'anything
, but halcyon ; for: Britain. 'True.l Napoleon, i

Kent came In and asked how she had be

rather troublesome.' The Princess touched
her and nald, 'No, Lehzen. twice, don't

Gret?k, mathematics, music and drawing
were the- chief studies pursued. In the
two, latter especially she made good prog"

strict economy and the habit of cash pay^
ment. This was all the, more remarkable
in an age when spendthrift extravagance
was held a princely virtue. She was also
taught to finish whatever she was doing
before she began anything, elseâ a rule
that was applied even to' her amusements.
Indeed, It would '.have been difficult for
her .mother . to -have educated her with
more prudence and. wisdom, and she grew
up submissive to 'authority -and happy In
the' pleasures. "of. tier- 'age. All knowledge
of her probable future dignity wns care
fully . kept from her. ' As she "grew old
enough to notice It, It puzzled her that
when *ho and her sister. were out together
the gentlemen took off their hats to.her
(Victoria) and not to the elder Jady. ' But
when it was explained to her that she was
a royal Princess of England, and her half
sister a German and of lower rank, she
was satisfied.
* Faults and Virtues.
Yet even the most careful training can
not make' children angels. The Princess
Victoria had . her\ faults like other chil
dren, and these faults have remained with
her through life, though In changed form
âthat Is to say. she was Impulsive. -and
sometimes not a little willful and . impe
rious. But as the affections are strong
and the head well trained, these matters
always righted themselves. She has an
Ingrained sense. of justice which can al
ways redress the 'balance.
In 1820 William IV. ascended the throne,
and" It was then that both mother and
governess held that the Princess Victoria
ought' to be Informed of her high rank.
One day, therefore, the genealogical table
of England, till then carefully kept "from
her, was purposely put Into her. lesson
book. The Princess opening it and seeing
the" additional paper said:
"I never saw that before." s
"It was not held necessary you should.

The young girl was quiet awhile, and
then paid:
"How. many- a child would boast! But
they ; don't know the difficulty. There la
much splendor, but there Is more respon
sibility."
The Princess, having lifted up' the fore
finger of her right hand while she spoke,
gave that. hand to her governess, say
ing:
"I will be good. I understand now. why
you ur^ed me so- much to learn, even

"But your Aunt Adelaide is still
young," Â¦; said, the governess, j "and " may
have children, and of course they would
ascend the" throne after their father, "Wil

Â¦To which tho girl replied:
"And if itwasso I should never '.'. feel
disappointed, for I know by the love Aunt
Adelaide bears me how fond she Is of
children." ' Â¦
: *lt , now' became j needful for Â¦ the ' little
Princess, as acknowledged heiress, : to be
seen sometimes at court and In public, but
her mopier took care. that these Interrup

Albert Visits Kensington.
- It' was ; In ; 1836 that the destined Prince
came' first r to ' the' quiet J shades of - Ken
sington.- Albert of Saxe-Coburg: was, first
cousin to the Queen on. her mother's side,
and. both their common uncle Leopold and
his ;. Intimate - : adviser. Baron ;; Stockmar,
had formed \ the Idea of -uniting these .two
cousins , in : marriage "from the tlm* they
were / .babies/; They : were > born ; - within
three months of each other, nursed by the
same nurses,--; reared , on \ the same system.
It; Is true. that It seemed something: of. a
mesalliance ; for : the Queen of ', England to
marry Â»a. petty German Prince, but as the
youth grew- up\ he gave such evident signs
ofiaaperiorjrmentaj capacity, that; It':. was
felt ? that'^ he : would '- make-up,; In ? wisdom
what hp lacked In birth. ;It.waa,:however,'
agreed * that 'neither should I know Jot ; the
plani but" that 'as soon v as possible the
the great 'disturber of the peace of > 1
tions, wan' enjoying, ample lelsuce o- ' the
rock of St. Helena to meditate upon. the
seas of blood with which he had IniquR
bu'sly- deluged Europe, and It was Kng
land ' that, almost unassisted, had wittiT
stood him and pinned him captive; but as
Inevitable reaction after a long war. there
was misery in the. land; taxes were high,
food was dear, trade was at a standstill.
The reigning King was old.; blind- arid
crazy; the Regent an elderly profligate.
No brilliant outlook, truly. ; .
It was a month after her birth that the j
small* royal Highness was baptized with
all pomp Jn : the grand saloon of Kensing
ton Palace." The royal gold font, long un
used, was' brought from the tower on
purpose, and archbishops and bishops per
formed the ceremony.
Â¦There ! was some little trouble about
finding a' name for the baby. . The father
# wishedtb"cali her Elizabeth, thinking that
from '( iti^glorious tradition : that would
proveajidme. to please] people"' should. she
occupy. thÂ« throne. : But jthe, Prince Re
gent. who 1 * was; godfather -together with
the Emperor^df. RussJa.V gave' only the
name of Alexandrlna to the clergy. â¢ Th*
father pleaded that another name be add-',
ed, and proposed the feminine form of the
Regent's own name, Gcorglna. But' tho
Regent said his name could not come in
the second . place, and as the Emperor's
must take precedence. If the baby had to
have. another name,- "give her her moth
er's." So the Princess came. to be called
Al^xandrina Victoria, and in infancy was
known as the Princess Drina, a name
she dropped after her accession.
D?ath of Victoria's Father.
It v/as the first winter after her birth
that the baby Princess went with her pa
rents to pass the cold months In the
â¢prety seacoast town of Sldmouth in Dev
onshire. The visit was to have a fatal
termination. The father, who was devot
ed to his child, came in one day wet after
walking In a storm, and instead of chang
ing his clothes lingered to play with the
baby. A chill struck- him, Inflammation
set in, und in January. 1S20. he died. leav
ing his six months' old child an orphan
in poor circumstances, under the sole
guardianship of her mother. Prince Leo
pold, brother of the widow, and ever af
ter the faithful friend and guide of mother
and daughter, came at once to be beside
his sister In the hour of- her sorrow, it
was he who advised that the Duchess
should stay on In England, that her child
might have an English educationâexpedi
ent, seeing how near she. stood to the
crown. Two days after. the death, there
fore, the Duchess and her babe returned
to London. The Infant held up at the car
riage window tx> bid farewell to the as
sembled population of. Sldmputh laughed
Joyously and patted the glasses with her
dimpled hands, In utter unconsciousness
of her bereavement. On the very day the
party arrived in London (January 29, 1821)
George III. was at last gathered to his
fathers, the worst, and happily last,
of the 'Georges ascended the throne.
Knowing the impurity of his court, the
Duohess of Kent, resolved from the first
to keep herself [- absent from it for. her
daughter's sake, and for this- her widow
hood and her very restricted pecuniary
means gave her a' good pretext. -The posi
tion of the Duchess was certainly a sad
and difficult one. She had resigned, her
German home and jointure, and was now
alone In a i foreign: land,' the 'language of
which she could hardly speak, with the
charge of bringing up its probable heir.
Kensington Palace .was assigned to , her
as a residence, and -here she received the
official deputation of condolence that wait
ed upon her. To spectators the; contrast
was painful between the tear-stained, face
of the mother and the smiling baby face
of the child. Here. In Kensington, with
frequent changes of scene in the sumnier,
the infant years of the Princess Victoria
were; passed.- In company -Â¦ of her mother
and her half-sister Feodore. It was no
infrequent sight to : see the ' two in 'the
gardens, the elder drawing. the younger. in
a little .carriage, . or. walking beside her
donkey chair. The baby^ liked; to be: no
ticed, and answered all vmo spoke 'to" her,
holding out her soft 'dimpled hand' to "be
kissed: Life passed quietly and somewhat
monotonously : at >the palace. The^ Queen
herself has. told us that her, childhood was
lonely and sad. ' Simplicity and regularity
were .the ;> marked - features ; of , her : early
life, that hadtone great.! wantâ that of a

spondent.-"that. you were continually
smiling during the proceedings and
seomed to be enjoying yourself very
much."
"Te3," replied the Prince, a shade of
I weariness creeping into h!S eyes, "that 13
where I act. If only you knew how terri
bly bored I am by the inordinate length
of snmo of there dinners and the speeches
and how I am all the time longing to pet
away, you would be really sorry for me.
But. there. I must not say too much on
that subject."
"With regard to horae-raclng and bet
; ting, your Royal Highness?" :Â»,, '
"I think ractFK- Is the finest sport tn thÂ»f
1 world, and I only regret that it shoulfl bo
harmed by the amount of bettlntr which
goes on. Personally I am stronely averse
to the practice, and I always. use wha.
Influence I possess to discountenance it
among my personal friends. especlaUy
when it is made a recular practice of and
the stakes are "arse."
"There are many people who think thnt
your Royal Tlishness has a very easy II fÂ«
of. It. Â»nd that the hardest duties which,
you have to perform are attending statt*
functions."
."Now. here in some Information for
you/' said the Prince. "Do you know that
I myself sÂ«;e every, letter which is ad
dressed to me, and In the majority of In
stances dictate the reply? When the mail
arrives in the morning it la opened by my
secretary's staff and sorted into three
group?â letters from personal friend* and
relative^ tho?? .bearing on state, affairs.
and. thirdly, bogging letters and peti
tions â and I mnke it my business to maka
myself aware of the contents of each.
This of itself Is no light task, when you
take into consideration the fact that each,
morning's mall consists of some hun
dreds of letter*. So that those who aajr
mine is an idle life malign me."
AÂ«kert hia opinion on South African af
fairs, he smilingly shook his head and re
fused to be drawn out. But he said that,
he should always remember with the
deepest affection and regard the heroic
conduct ef the troops in the campaign.
"One more question." said the corre
spondent. "What Is your Royal Highness*
favorite recreation?"
"Shooting." he replied, unhesitatingly.
"There" Is nothing I like better than a
good day's hunt. It seems thÂ« only thlnjr
which takes me out of myself and makes
me forget the cares and responsibilities
of my position."
There was one more remark that tha
Prince made which will he of Interest. a3
It bears on the America's cup. for. al
though his Royal Highness has not taken
so much Interest In yacht racing since tht>
pritannia. he openly confesses that "thÂ»rn
are few things which I would like better

" ONDOX. Friday. Jan. 11.â The .
p| following Is the substance of j
H : an Interview with the Prince j
Kg ! of Wales which Is, to appear)
â¢ g^ : \*M shortly In a London magazine, j
There is every reason to he- '
";. -; Ileve It Is i perfectly genuine.,
and It is -understood to , be the first
interview In which. 'his Royal Highness
has bepn directly quoted:
A correspondent who had been priv'
leged to â¢ meet -the Prince of Wales on
more than. one occasion had an Interview
with England's future King at Marlbor
ough. House, his Rqyal Highness" Lort
don residence. â¢ some' days 1 ago.' The
Prince talked with great frankness con
cerning himself and his views on various
subjects. If any. one 'ever deserved the
appellation of "a busy man." the Prince
does, and there are few city merchants
or business men who work harder thiÂ»n
he does, and even the London public has:
no idea of the quantify of work he gets
through In the course of a day. It Is only
by following a; moat methodical arrange
ment that he Is able to do so much us h*> 1
does In the time. As a matter of fact, all I
his engagements are made weeks and I
sometimes months ahead, and every hour,
almost every minute. Is mapped' out for
him.
,yvvhen the correspondent was ushered
Into his study at Marlbcrough House the
Prince was seated at an old-fashioned
pedestal writing desk, the fac simile of |
the one used, by his father, the late Pfince
Consort, which was piled high with pa
pers, and. documents -of all descriptions.
He wore a black morning coat and vest.
dark gray Jrousere, square fronted col
lar, with a 'white spotted black bow tie,
and patent leather shces. and in his fin
gers he held the Inevitable cigar. His
greetipj was kind In the. extreme. It -was
merely like an' elderly business man!
amiUnfr a kindly welcome to some young
and Â«tarJnEf mtrduer. \ .
. "Well, what do you want me to say?"
was hi? K'Â«yal Highness' auery as soon
as the rÂ«xHro.lnary greeting was over.
: 'Tim correspondent launched forth his
iiuc>Â«tions, l>Â«-slnninpr with inquiries about
the numerous public dinners which the
Prince attended, and alluding to the
published statement that the Prince held 1
the record for obtaining the largest
sum of money ever .collected at one ban
quet.
"Yes, that's . quite . correct. I certainly
hold the record In that respect," said the
Prince. "And > presiding at dinners, etc..
for the benefit of charities, especially
Masonic ones. Is almost a pleasure to
me. The only part, which I do. not llkÂ»
about tho proceedings Is if the dinner
drags Itself out to a considerable length
That I do not like, and when dining In
private lit home . the meal seldom lasts
more than an hour." '_..'Â¦
"I have, read many, time* In reports of
dinners, etc, at which your Royal High-
young people should meet and see if they
couid love each other before making any
other arrangements. Shrewd Baron Stock
mar, who gave this advice, was well
aware of the potency j of the spell the
young Prince bore about with him, name
ly that of great personal beauty and sim
ple, charming manners. So in 1836 Prince
Albert/and his brother Erneet.. lads of
sixteen and seventeen, were sent to Eng
land to see the country and visit their re
lations. A pleapant month passed, during
which the cousins *aw much of each oth
er, singing and drawing together and vls
ittns the sights. They evMentlr came to
some understanding, for among the rings
the Queer} wears to this day Is one. a
small enamel with a tiny diamond In the
center, given her by Prince Albert when
he flrst'eame to England as a lad of sev
enteen. Still nothing was ssttled. and
nothing, it seems, was said to the Prince,
who returned to his studies at Bonn Uni
versity-. The King of the Belgians, how
ever, had confided his pet scheme to his
niece, who,* In a letter to him (Jttne 7,
1S36), acknowledges her affection for her
cousin. "I have only now. to beg you. my
dearest uncle," It concludes, "to take care
of the health of one now so dear to' me,
and to take him under your special pro
tection. I hope and trust that all will go
on prosperously and well on this sub
ject, now of so much Importance to me."
.' In consequence of this letter, of which
Prince Albert, however, was ignorant, a
turn was given to hLs studies that should
prepare him for his future exalted posi
tion.
Princess Comes of Age.
Â¦ Meantime, in May, 1S37,- the Princess
came of age; for royal folk, for reasons
unexplained, are allowed this privilege
three years earlier than common people.'
There were great national rejoicing*, and
a state ball was given: but at this neither
King nor Queen were Rble to be present,
for rough-spoken" William IV. lay upon
v;hat was to prove his deathbed. He had,
however, attained his dsstre â to see the
Princess of age ere his death, for he did
not wi&h that the sister-in-law he most
unjustly hated should hold â¢ the reins of
government. The festivities over, the
Princess Victoria returned once more to
the' privacy of her life at Kensington Pal
ace. . But It was not to be of long dura
tion. " In the early dawn of June M tbe
gate porter was roused by a knockirfg.
which, like that In "Macbeth," was sig
nificant of a King's death. A coach and
four had dashed full speed up the great
central avenue. Its occupants grave men
who listened not to the birds/ morning
songs, nor noticed the sweetness of thu
flower-scented rooming air. They heeded
only the importance of their solemn er
rand. "They knocked, they rang, they
thumped for a considerable time before
they could : rouse the porter at the gate;
they were again kept waiting in thÂ»
courtyard; then -turned into â¢ one of the
Iqwer rooms, where tney seemed to be for
gotten by everybody. They rang the bell,
and" desired that' the attendant of tho
Princess Victoria might be sent to Inform
her royal Highness that they " re'iues'ted
an audience on business of* Imuortnnce.
After anqther delay and another ringing
to Jnculre ; the cause, the attendant was

SYMPATHY AT
WASHINGTON
turned to Parliament, where before there
were only CO. ,
Disraeli did not wait for. the new Par
liament. He resigned a? Premier, and
Mr. Gladstone was at once, sent for, ac
cepted the" Premiership and went to worl
to formulate his famous Irish polio
After five years of power, having aceom
pllshed great things, having seen tho
beginning of the Irish Home Rule- party,
Gladstone's lease cf oITlce was terminated
by a vote in the Irish University. - -
The accession of the second conserva
tive Ministry of Disraeli .found the budget
with a balance of Â£60,000,000. Sugar .du
ties were abolished, and the income tax
reduced to 2d on,- the pound.. This.- the
ninth Parliament of. Queen Victoria, sat
for six years. Dl?raeli, now come to be
the Earl of Beaconsfield. giving' the coun
try some occasional "surprises. . One of
these' was the llnancial coup by which he
purchased from the Khedive' of .Egypt
his interest In the Suez canal., rudely
awakening the French from their dream
of control. Another was the; acquisition
of the Turkish IfIc of Cypress, handed
over for a guarantee to Turkey of' her
Asiatic provinces in the evc-nt of any
future Russian encroachments.-
Notwithstanding these performances,
the Beaeonsfleld Ministry went down be
fore the flood of Irish debates, and Glad
stone assumed office In 1SS0, ' "carrying
through both houses that measure known
as the Irish land act.two new men being
in his Cabinet in the persons of Joseph
Chamberlain and Sir Charles DHke.
The Eastern question had-'kept'all'Eu
rope busy for some years, as It seems
destined to do for many more, and Eng
lish Ministries were hard worked; but
they kept pegging away at this and that

Almost simultaneously with " the as
sembling-of Parliament on February 19.

toum and the. death of "Chinese" Gordon.
These terrible events sent. a thrill .of hor
ror through the country-;, and the Govern
ment was severely condemned for its pro
crastination. Mr." Gladstone appealed for
a vote of confidence. Financial questions
were embarrassing, and when. In April,
the budget was ready. It showed proposals
for an augmentation of the spirit
duties; 'Country members were dis
satisfied, and agricultural and whisky "in
terests were discontented. ' The Chancel
lor made some concessions, but they were
not regarded as sufficient, and, the opposi
tion joined battle.. Mr. Gladstone stated
at the close of the debate that the-Gov
ernment would reeign If ; defeated. The
amendment was carried against, them,

On March 29 Mr. Gladstone 1 announced
that on. April 8 he would ask leave to

that on the 15th. he would, ask leave to

in Ireland. The same, day Mr. Chamber
lain and Mr. Trevelyan resigned, and.op

bate In the House on the home rule bill
ended June? in the defeat of the Govern
ment. The "grand old man" appealed to
the country, but the elections were against
him. resulting In the alignment of Par
liament as follows: Home Rule Liberals,
or Gladstonians, 194; "Irish Nationalists,
85; total. 279. Seceding Liberals, 75; Con

Mr. Gladstone Resigns.
With the Irish question always to the
fore, controversies with the United States
on boundary and fisheries questions kept
the Salisbury Government reasonably
busy until its dissolution, in 1892, having
been In existence since 1S86. , Great excite-;
ment prevailed in' thw ensuing, election,
the. Gladstone, or Liberal party,'' favoring
home rule, winning . by a' majority 42
in the House. As a result,-Lord'Salis
bury resigned and Mr. Gladstone, formed
the Government, but it was not' until Feb
ruary. 1893, that he Introduced and carried
through the Commons his home rule bill.
The bill was rejected in the Lords. : Fall
ing eyesight and hearing caused Mr. Glad
stone to resign in March. 1854, Lord Rose
bury, much against the opposition of La
bouchere and others who had no liking
for a Lord, succeeding him. Despite the
troubles from Irish Nationalists, 8cotch
crofters and Welch churchmen, Lord
Rosebury stuck at the helm for a year,
when, displeased at criticisms from Glad
stone, who did not like the. : inaction of
the Ministry on the Armenian atrocities,
he resigned. . Â¦ : /* . 'Â¦'
Lord Salisbury was again entrusted with
the formation of a Cabinet. .It is unneces
sary to enumerate the task of this Min
istry. Dn the whole, even allowing for the
war fever, tha' triumphant vindication of
its war policy at the polls Is an Indication
that the pedple of Great Britain think tha
work well done. i'.^'-fi-v-^
TEN Prime Ministers. WTii*
aftfrRS'4 (Liberal) and Con
servative, were called during
the Jong reigtt of Quern-Vic
toria, to form the twenty Min
istries under which the Go\*
ernrncntal affairs of the United
Kingdom were transacted. Be-
Einninir with Lord Melbourne and endinp
Â¦with Salisbury, the ablest statesmen of
KrsRlar.d received from the hands of the
Queen the direction of affairs, and despite
the fact that several of them were heart
ily detected for pome of their acts the af
fairs of the kingdom have gone on apace.
The Whig: Ministry of Lord Melbourne
went out in 1S39, after failure to bring to
Fucoessful conclusion a bill to suspend the
constitution of Jamaica. The Queen pent
for the Duke of Wellington and he advised
her to fÂ»nd for Sir Robert Peel. Peel ac
cepted the task of forming- a Ministry ajid
almost Immediately came the famous dis
pute â singular coincidence in the reifjn of
a supposedly weak younu woman â known
as the "Bedchamber question." the "ques
tion de jupons." The Queen wished to re
tain her ladies In waiting. Peel insisted
there must be pome change. Two of these
lafiies were closely related to Whig states
man, whose policy was. of course, opposed
to Peel on no less Important a. question
than the government of Ireland. Peel In
sisted that he could not undertake to gov
ern under such conditions. The Queen,
acting <m advice, would not jrtve way. The
Importance of this dispute ww that Peel
â¢was equally obstinate, and the "Whig Min
istry had to come back, discredited at
that, as Melbourne Kay*, "behind the pet
ticoaU of the laidies in waiting."
The Chartist Agitation.
Direful predictions, fortified by this Indr
dent, seemed nure of realization In a con-,
tinued petticoat grovernment under the
younÂ£ QueÂ«n. Other and more important
issues came on with the opening of Parlia
ment. "Chartism" was the subject of the
Queen's message. The doctrine was em
bodied Jn a bill calling for universal suf
frage, excluding, however, women; divi
sion of the .United Kingdom into, eqjial
electoral districts; vote by ballot: annual
Parliaments; no property qualifications
for members: and a payment to every
member for his legislative service. The
principles so quickly recommended them
selves to the working classes that, in the.
session of 1SS3 the signatures to a petition
to Parliament numbered upward of a mil
lion and a quarter. The chartlaU divided
themselves into physical force and moral
force winss, the former coming . into
physical contact with the Government on
several occasions, on one occasion ten be
ing killed and fifty wounded. Hundreds
of others were tried and convicted all over
the kingdom. As a result the Whigs were
heartily hated and In 1S42 the second Mel
bourne Ministry came a cropper on chart
ism and tariff legislation. 4*
In came Peelâ end of "petticoat" govern
mentâand out, of their ovra accord, went
three ladles in waitingâ the Duchess of
Bedford, the Duchess of Sutherland . and>
Lady Normandy.
The day the bill repealing the obnoxious
corn laws was read for the third time in
the House of Lords (Juna 26. 1S46) saw the
fall of the Peel Ministry on the coercion
bill for Ireland. The attack on Peel was
led by Sir Georse BerUnck and Benjamin
Disraeli, then Just making himself felt. in
the House of Commons. Peel was defeat
ed by an overwhelming majority.
Lord Sas sell's Ministry.
Lord John Russell was intrusted with
the next Ministry, which lasted till 1B52,
Â¦when It went down before the opposition
of Lord Palmerston on the militia, bill. In
the new Cabinet, of which Lord Derby
was chief, Dieracll became Chancellor of
the Exchequer. After a short and stormy
administration, after failure to compro
mise with Palmerston and the Peelltes
owing to the veto of the Queen, Lord
Derbys Ministry fell.

of the Sepoy mutiny and thÂ« assumption

Lord Derby cam? in again and soon fell.
to be succeeded by Palmerston, who, old
and feeble as he was, formed the strongest
Ministry of modern time*. *o far as the
individual ability of its members was con
cerned. Russell went to the Foreign Of
fice and Gladstone to the Exchequer.
The civil war in America and the conse
quent cotton famine which *hut down
English mills', gave this administration
enough to do. Its dealings with the North
and South are well known to every child
in the United States. On the death of
Lord Palmerston in 1SC5 the Premiership
was again intrusted to Lord John Russell,
with Mr. Gladstone, as leader in the House
Â¦rt Commons. Parliament was opened on
February 6, iS66, and on March 12 follow
ing Mr. Gladstone brought forward his
f^hera* cf reform, proposing to extend the
franchise in counties and boroughs. The
opposition, however, of the Moderate Lib
erals and their junction with the Con
servatives proved fatal to the measure,
and the Ministry of Earl Russell rÂ«e!gned
and for the third jlrco Earl Derby came
in at the head of a Ministry, Mr. Disraeli
apain taking the Chancellorship of the
Exchequer.
The failure of this bill brought Lord
Rustell's political career to a close. He
formally handed over the leadership of the
party to Gladstone. Lord Derby, his op
ponent, soon followed his example, and the
long-standing duel between -Gladstone and
Disraeli took the center of the Parlia
mentary Ktace.

Derby-Disraeli Ministry in power until
M?rch. 18CS, when the crisis came In a
remarkable debate that had for Its sub
ject the condition of Ireland. It was in
troduced by a series of resolutions ' pro
posed tay John Francis Maffuire, an Irish
member. It was not till the fourth night
of the debate that the Importance of the.
debate became manifest. Then it was
that Mr. Gladstone spoke. He declared
that, in his opinion, the time had come
when the Irish church, as a state insti
tution, must cease. Men only waited to
s?Ae how he would procure its fall. A few
days later he proposed . resolutions to
that effect. An amendment proposed by
Lord Stanley, declaring that the matter
ought to be reserved for the decision of
the next Parliament, proclaimed even
more purely than the resolutions the Im
pending fall of the Irish church. .
On the division there were 270 votes for
the amendment and 231 against'. A month

up and was carriedâ 330 votes for to 263'

POPE EXPRESSES
DEEP SORROW
TiK news of the serious Illness
of the Queen of- Great Britain
has been received with the
deepest concern by the many
British residents in this city,
and' their" solicitude is in
creased by the distance which
separates them from the '
mother country. Residents of many year?
in this citv. they have not forgotten the
country of their birth, and though their
Inerests and homes are on the Pacific
Slope, Â¦ their ; hearts are centered on the
small island on the south coast of Eng
land, where .the sovereign ruler of. the
British Empire lies awaiting the call of
the King of Kings.
The long . reign of Queen Victoria, her
many virtues and the great achievements
in science and art. fostered by the aged
monarch, have endeared her to her sub
jects and to those who have adopted other
countries as "their" homes, and wherever
an Englishman "was to be found In this
city yesterday, there was one paramount
hope in his mindâ that the ruler of Great
Britain might be spared by providence for
many years to come.
A number of prominent citizens of Eng
lish birth yesterday spoke with deep fsel
ing of the aged Queen.
James McNab said: "The reign of the
Queen ahd the noble traits she possesses
have exerted - a pronounced Influence
throughout the Trhole world. She has been
a prominent, factor In doing good and
all Englishmen know that she has done
thousands of kindly acts which have nevtr
been made public. If providence decides
to call her to her rest, millions will be
stricken with griefâ not only her subjects
but the people of all nations.1 Her per
sonal character has been a most remark
able one and she has always been in every
sense a good and noble woman. As a
monarch she has ever displayed a
strength of power. Even her Ministers at
tWbes have been obliged to yield to the
CJueen <pn matters of vital import.
Thrpughout the whole world, under mon
archy *or" " republic, there has been for
many years the deepest reverence for the
Queen on account of her age and her
splendid reign.
"The demise of the Queen will not. In
my mind, affect the policy of England's
Government. I have often heard It said
that with the death of Victoria. England
would become a republic. I was In Eng
land recently and was struck by the enor
mous popularity of the Prince of Wales.
There is no more popular man in Eng
land, and while the subjects of the Queen
will deeply deplore her death, yet the'ac
cession of the Prince of . Wales to the
throne will soothe tile universal grief. I
have never seen a' picture of the Prince
which conveys a true Idea of his charac
ter. His photographs convey the Idea that
he is a dull man. ' He is just the con
trary. He is full of life, and as I watched
him a few months ago on the Ascot race
course he seemed to have a word for
every one who surrounded him. The Prin
cess of "Wales is beloved by the English
people and her actions have served In
many ways to counteract the feeling
which was exnressed at one time over
the mode of- life of the Prince. The Eng
lish people know that he will make a
good sovereign, for he is liberal in thought
and is a patron of the arts and sciences.
Although death comes to all, I can but
hope that providence will spare the Queen
to her subjects, for to quote the Bard of
Avon, the world will never see her like
again."
"The subjects and former subjects of
Queen Victoria." said Andrew WUkle last
night, "have always revered her as a
woman, for she was of a kindly disposi
tion. There Is no question but that thÂ»
Boer trouble has been mainly instrument
al in her breaking down at this time. It
is particularly ead that she should pass
away with England at war with another
nation. The British people In common
Â¦with others have always wondered at thÂ»
gTeat vitality and strength shown by her.
"Many another woman would havÂ»
years ago given way under the great
mental stretch and strain shÂ« has
borne. Perhaps It would have been
tetter If she had abdicated tha
throne In favor of thÂ« Princs
of Wales some years asto. but who can
tell? She has rounded out a life of use
fulness and the tears of many million
people will best express their love and
reverence for her."
The Rev. Dr. John Hemphlll said:
"Queen Victoria was the grandest wom
an that ever sat en the throne of Eng
land and her passing away will end thÂ»
career of one of the finest characters In
English history- She has done more than
any other woman or man for the moral
and spiritual uplifting of England. This
fact will become more apparent even af
ter she has ceased to exist, for It Is only
then we will arrive at a full realization
of her true worth.
"Queen Victoria has started a good In
fluence In England that will live Ions
after she has gone. She la beloved and
honored, not only In the land over which
she has reigned with such honor for so>
many years, but other lands wh.ere her
true womanly nature has come to be best
understood, hold her In the highest re
gard and sincerest veneration.
"My hope and prayer !s that her suc
cessor, forgetting the follies and frivoli
ties of earlier life, may rise to the situa
tion and waJk in the footsteps of his Illus
trious and magnificent mother. He could,
wish for no better example, for with her
as a pattern, the glorious record of Eng
lish royalty as exemplified by Victoria
will be perpetuated and ever be worthy
of the commendation of all people."

In reference to the report that the

all sorts of reasons are suggested. One

her constant attendant. Princess Beatrice,

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 20.â Although the
cartoon bill has been dead since
the day after its passage, a bill
will be introduced in the Senate
by Davis to-morrow giving it the official
ax. No one ever minded it, its provisions
have never been sought by any one whose
features or feelings were hurt by the
artist's pencil and it has not had even the
poor pleasure of goiner before the Supreme
Court and being knocked out in a free le-
gal fight.
Davis' measure is in the form of a bill
to repeal section 1 of an act entitlea
"An act to add a new section to the Penal
Code, to be known as section 25V relating
to the publication of portraits and carica
tures," approved February 23, 1899.
The cartoon act was a measure rushed
through the last session of the Legislature
trouble from both sides. Dunlap's idea
lumps the Sacramento Valley with Pla
cer, El Dorado, Sierra. Calaveras, Ama
dor and half a dozen other mining coun
ties that will not stand for it any mora
than the valley counties will stand for the
miners. And In making a fourth and fifth
district Dunlap would take the northern
half of San Francisco and put it In with
Marin and with the southern half he
would link San Mateo. The constitution
says that when more than one Congres
sional District is contained within, the
boundaries of a countv the district shall
first bfe carved out and then the remain
der of the county shall be linked with con
tiguous territory. One district may be
made in the southern part of San Francis
co and the remainder to the north joined
to Marin, or vice versa, and the remain
der to the south joined to San Matco or
even a district mav be made to the west
and the eastern portion may be Joined to
Alameda. a proposal that has raised
trouble from Alameda more than once,
but no would-be apportloner can split the
city in the middle and divide the halves
with the countrv.
The Franchise Bill.
In the franchise bill there is a lull, pos
sibly before a storm, but it looks now as
if the south may achieve by amendment
what it was at first thought it would have
to iicht for.
Could the term fight be applied to th<Â»
university legislative campaign it wouH
be apt, for there is every prospect that
the State's "educational crown" will have
to get down with the rest and scran for
the bones. It seems Ihe intention of the
Governor to go as far as possible toward,
getting the university into politics.
A little last session, ft little mora
this. Just an inch more .if he should get
In again and another after that, and th*
institution will be on a par with State
hospitals, insane asylums and peniten
tiaries. It is the Governor's idea that
the university should come to every ses
sion with palm extended asking for
enough to live on for the two ye"ars com
ing, and unless past and present method?
change there will be no lark of strings
upon what will be given. The Governor
has offered the money for the Governor s
mansion and he has offered other an-f
equally glittering gifts, but what the uni
versity wants is not alms but income;
something by right and not by favorj
something to count on and not hope for.
The Alameda delegation, it is suspected,
at the Insulration of the Governor, has
caucused and discussed and conferred and
meditated, but so far there has been no
result except to provoke the inquiry as
to why Alameda is consulted to the ex
clusion of the remainder of the. State. 'It
Is not an Alameda institution, despite Al
ameda*s Justifiable pride of possession,
and others more distant but- not less in
terested are beginning to wonder when
they will be allowed to say a word. The
measures proposed bv the ReerentsÂ». the
alumni and the organized friends of the
university have been passed by and the
needs of the institution are being pro
vided for in the same old way.

on the wave of feeling arising from the
Burns Senatorial campaign. No one ever
thought it was a good measure, and when
it was finally rushed through those who
spoke in its favor and voted for; it were
willing to declare it would always be a
dead letter. Tts passage was the signal
for much oratory, good and bad, : and a
great deal of congratulation among those
who hoped under its protecting wing^to
escape much of the castigating they
would deserve in the future, as they ihad
deserved In the past. It was hurried to
the Governor, and he set aside a half-hun
dred good bills tha* had been passed by
the House to sign the measure, and amid
great satisfaction it became a law.
Since then it has lain inactive, like a
toad in a cellar, and in being brought out
to be done away with it Is serving its best
purpose. The signature law. which is
one of the same stripe, will probably be
put on the same toboggan.

Â£. \* MENTO, Jan. 20.â Caxter of Los

bly Committee on Apportionment
. and Census, is working on an ap
portionment bill which will present radi
cal departures from the lines laid down
by the Cutter bill. He has practically
completed the division of the State into
Assembly districts, but as yet he has not
touched upon Senatorial and Congres
sional districts. " .
Carter, has attempted in his- bill to group
the counties with small population into
Assembly districts according to their com
munity of interests." Mining counties are
grouped and agricultural counties put in
other districts as much as possible. He
has attempted to give as equable repre
sentation according to population as pos
sible, and to some extent has taken -into
consideration the probabilities . as to
growth in population of ;various sections
within the next four years. .

will give it two. vThe county's population
is 27,927. The population per Assembly
man for the whole State is 18,563.- Carter
points out that Cutter gives Humboldt

Thomas Roy Meets With an Accident
and Barely Escapes With His
Life.
SAX RAFAEL, Jan. 2aâ An old resident
of this county, Thomas Roy, met with a
bad accident on White's Hill this after
noon and barely escaped with his life.
While crossing the hill his horse became
frightened and plunged over the embank
ment. Horse, driver and vehicle rolled
down the gulch. Mr. Roy was thrown
out and terribly cut and bruised. Tho
horse struggled to his feet and scrambled
back to the road, drawing with, him thÂ»
shafts and front wheels. After reaching
the road the animal commenced a furious
pace down the grade. Several teams had
narrow escapes from collision with the
runaway. The Injured man was removed
to his brother's home and medical aid
summoned.
Sl*Â«*.i*J Dispatch to Th* Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 20.â While the thir
ty-fourth session made a good
ftart and a quick one. it seems to
. have lost its first energy and
elaxkened its pace. Two weeks have gone
by and Ftill no bill of importance has
parsed either house, no committee has got
down to Its work and some have not even
organized. The only activity is shown In
the introduction of bills, and from the
character of most of them it is apparent
that but few will ever reach the Governor.
No orator has so far developed among
the new men. and the silver-tongued of
the old members have had no opportunity
for flights of fancy. The session has hard
ly been serious so far. and. lacking the
recesFity for close attention to work, the
thoughts of the legislators have been
Â¦v/andering. One genius in the Assembly
has figured that it costs the State $70
every time Clio Lloyd, chief clerk of the
Assembly, calls the roll of that body.
Lloyd is new to the desk, but he is learn
ing, and he will be able to reduce the
amount by nearly J50 before the first
month has passed.
The attention of the Assembly has also
wandered to the "consideration of sten
ographers, directed thither by an incident
attending the death of Collins of Butte
last week. When on the morning after
Collins died the roll was called Johnson
arose at the mention of the deceased
member's name and In a short address in
formed the members of the break in their
ranks ar.d spoke a few touching words of
the life and deeds of the dead. The news
paper representatives took notes of what
Johnson said, some in longhand and some
In shorthand, but when Chief Clerk Llovd
announced after the roll call that tho
ppeech had been taken down by one of the
official stenographers of the Assembly all
gladly accepted the offer of a verbatim
copy.
How the Stenographer Worked.
The copy was not forthcoming at 10:30,
nor at 11. nor yet at U o'clock, but when
thÂ» noon recess had been declared the
official stenographer of the Assembly was
seen busily writing at the dictation of one
of the Can Francsico newspaper men.
The newspaper man was slowly dictating
Johnson's speech from the notes he had
taken, and the stenographer was taking
his words down in longhand.
After the recess, there were passed
around to the newspaper men typewritten
copies of Johnson's words, with the com
pliments of the official stenographer. Thev
were accepted with profuse gratitude, but
the story got out, and now the shorthand
people of the lower house are being ex
amined.
The ceremonies of the Electoral College,
fceld last Monday, were the subject of
much favorable comment, spiced with a
single protestâ one against the propriety
of Frank McGowan's address. He had
been warned not to make it political, and
In his opening f entence he announced that
he had been asked not -to Include politics,
end having said it he launched into a
eulogy of the Republican party that would
have made pood campaign stuff In the end
of October.- but was just poor, taste last
Monday. The keynote of the exercises
was the will of the majority as expressed
la s=t Nm ember becoming the will of all in
March, and in everything done and said
party was lost sight of and the choice of
McKinley was looked upen as the choice
of Republicans and Democrats alike. In
Shortridsre's address, which was a tact
ful, graceful effort, party names were
mentioned not once, and all he said con
veyed the idoa that whatever the strug
gles of the campaign when the result was
announced it was announced as the choice
of the whole people. His address showed
in marked contrast to that of McGowan
which closely followed it. And after the
exercises as pleased a man as could be
found in Sacramento was Shortridge. for
he was received with the demonstration
of the day.
In marked contrast to the enthusiastic
audience that filled the Assembly cham
ber on Monday afternoon was that which
gathered there Frid.iy afternoon to honor
the nu-mory of a departed member. It
was a beautiful service that speeded Col
lms of Butte to his last rest and one not
often seen. He is but the second that has
met the reaper while sitting in a house
cf the Legislature.
Legislators Want Protection.
Following the death of Collins has come
a demand that something be done to pro
tect the health cf men who leave a genial
Climate or at least one they are accus
tomed to. and come to Sacramento during
two of the worst months of the year, and
th.s demand has taken form In the con
stitutional amendments mentioned in yes
terday's dispatches to The Call and to be
introduced to-morrow. There is not a
legislator who has not a cold in the head
or in the feet or or the chest or lungs.
Mia these lesser ailments are complicated
by symptoms of Kryi and chills and -a
variety of other thing-s numerous enough
to warrant an oppuient air among the
medical men. Several members of both
houses, among them Senator Muenter.
who hap been in beil over a week with
rnfumonia, have b*Â»Â»Â«ii given leaves of ab
sence, and the sudden death of Collins?,
who caine hero a healthy man at the open-
Ing cf the session, has emphasized the
need of some improvement in the time of
meeting.
The nghts Jn the legislature bo far
sepm to be centered around the franchise
bill, the apportionment, and perhaps the
contest for Gardner's; seat in the Senate
by Ben P. Tabor of Placer, although this
last is very much like a contest in name
only. Lardner won by one vote. He is
a Republican. Tabor, the Democrat, is
contesting before the Senate Committee
on Elections, which has for members
Devlin (chairman). Taylor, Burnett. Smith
of Los Angeles. Selvage. Corlett. Davis.
Nutt and Ashe. Of these nine but the
lonely Ashe Is a Democrat. Truly Tabor
resembles the snowball eo often referred
to as being in the custody of his Satanic
majesty, if the vote were not so clo?e
there might be some chance, for the com
mittee is composed of men as fair as the
Senate can furnish, but that does not
make it a fair committee, and when it
may ccme to a matter of judgment It
would look better if It came from more
than one source.
Appointment Schemes.
As to apportionment, a new element
will enter the field, probably to-morrow,
when Carter of Los Angeiee. chairman of
the House Committee on Apportionment
takes a hand. Carter has a bill of his
own which he will submit, and then he
End his Assemblymen can fight Cutter and
his Senators, while a bevy of the dele
gations gathers around, each one stirring
up the mud in Its own puddle and de
manding much more than It will get or
even hopes to reach. Alameda wants an
other Assemblyman and she doesn't care
where she gets him.- San Francisco

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 20.â The question of the
election of a United States Senator will
be brought up again at this session, this
time by Senator- Davis, who has a plan
that has proven efficacious in the case of
Presidential Electors and should -work
as well In the cholce'of a Senator. '-'. Davis'
plan would simply transfer to the section
of the United States constitution that re
fers to the selection of a Senator the lan
guage used in the section referring to the
selection of Electors, which would ' have
a. Senator by appointment by the Legis
lature or by popular election' at 'the op
tlo n . ., of the Legislature.
Article I, section 3, subdivision^ of the
United States constitution says: '.The
Senate of the United States shallbe" com
posed . of; two Senators from each State
Â¦chosen by the Legislature thereof for six
years and each Senator shall have one
vote." - â¢
j There can be no doubt of the Intention
In regard to Senators under this language,
but with Electors it is different. Article
II, section 1, subdivision 2 of the consti
tution says:
"Each Btate shall appoint in such man
ner as the Legislature thereof may direct
a number of Electors equal to the whole
number of Senators and Representatives
tp which the State may be entitled in the
Congress."
-Under this -section it is made optional
with Legislatures whether they shall ap
point Electors or the Electors shall be
elected by popular vote. Senator Davis,
would have practically the same language
apply to each and upon this idea he has
framed the following joint resolution,
which will be submitted to the Senate to
morrow: Â¦ Â¦ :
Senate Joint i No. , relative to
the appointment of United States Senators by
each State.
Resolved, By the Senate and Assembly Joint
ly, that article 1, section 3, subdivision 1 of the
constitution of . tho United States should be
amended to read cs follows:
The Senate of, the United States shall be
composed of two Senators from each State.
Each State shall appoint In such manner as
the Legislature may direct said two Senators
for six. years ard each Senator Bhall have
one vote. .'
By placing Senators upon the plane
originally occupied by Electors, Senator
Davis believes that in the course of time
political evolution will bring about the
electon of Senators by popular vote just
as it has brought about the election of
Electors. .--'.Â¦ . .
"Originally Legislatures appointed the
Electoral College directly," said, Senator
Davis this afternoon, "but after a few
years it got so that many of them left
that power to the people-, but as late as
1S32 a number appointed the Electors.
"There never was a national nominat
ing convention until 1S32, when Andrew
Jackson ran for President, and was nomi
nated, for the office by the Democratic
party- in a convention held in Baltimore,
and up to 1860. at the brealting out of the
rebellion, the Legislature of South Caro
lina appointed, her . Electors.-.- ;_ ;. .â¢ .
.. "If,: we, adopt ., the same'.law and apply
it to thej selection of a United States Sen
ator, the selection in e,ach State ultimate
ly passing into the hands of the people
will be but a repetition of history.
"The trouble in getting the section re
lating "to- the selection of a- Senator
amended:has always been because of the
Senate itself. A great and respectable
portion of that body has come from the
.New England States and the South,
where polities are settled and where the
appointment, of a Senator by the Legis
lature has been most satisfactory. With
this resolution there Is no reason why the
conservative members of the States of
New England or the South or anywhere
else should raise opposition to 'the plan
because its adoption will pass up to each
Legislature the question of whether It
shall appoint directly by its own voice
or indirectly by the votes of the people.
Just as in the case of the Presidential
Electors. The question of the selection of
a United States Senator by the people
would thus work itself out as naturally
and as easily as the question of the elec
tion of Presidential Electors by the peo
ple has worked itself out."
Senator Davis' idea is a new one and
strictly in line with the tendency of the
constitution to let each State regulate its
own affairs in its own way. By the
amendment the conservative States could
go on as they have been doing and the
greater number of others that are agitat
ing the question of a selection of their
Senators by a direct voto of the people
can work out their will, leaving no radi
cal change in the system. â¢ Senator Davis
considers his amendment an entering

The problem which now confronts the
people of Yolo County is a serious one
and demands prompt and decisive action.
For two or three years the rainfall has
Tx'-en inFUfficlent. The result has been
short crops of cereals and much damage
to tree? and vine?. In view of the fact
that water sufficient to Irrigate every acre
cf lard In Yolo annually runs to waste, it
Is inconceivable that the people of Yolo
County will permit present conditions to
exist. The facilities for winter irrigation
are easily within grasp. All needed to be
done is to utilize them. There may be
many seasons when irrigation is not nec
essary, but by using the advantages that
nature has placed within reach there will
be r.o turn thing in the future as short
crops cr dead fruit trees on account of a
lack of sufficient moisture.

IRRIGATION PROBLEM
IN YOIX> COUNTY
Superintendent Rogers of the railway
was reported snowbound at the summit
of the mountain passÂ« of the road. He
and other officials found it practically
impossible to do anything to relieve the
situation during tho progress of the storm.
Snow shovelers were scarce and every
thing indicated that the road, under most
favorable circumstances, would not be in
operation for several days after the sail
ing of the City of Seattle, January. 14.
The nearest engine was fifteen miles, out
from Skaguay, with trains, engines and
rotaries every fifteen or twenty miles, al
most buried in the snow, all the way to
White Horse. The last passenger train
reached White Horse January s 9. Mean
while passengers bound for the Klondike
were arriving at Skaguay by, the score.
All told eight engines and two or. three
rotaries are reported stalled In the snow.
The new rotary, sent nortn from this city
about a month ago, was blocked at Gla
cier. Many of the engines ran" out of
water, having to depend upon . melted
snow. Â¦
Frequent winds, at times of almost hur
ricane force, accompanied the snowfall.
The Dominion telegraph wires went down
January. 10 below White Horse, shutting
off communication ' with Dawaon; Â¦ As
heavy winter travel^ began just after Jan
uary 1 not less than 500 travelers going in
or coming out were caught between LakA
Bennett and Dawson. Little ' danger to
them is apprehended as roadhouses au

Train after train was held by 'the ob

miles above Fraser; No. 2, at Pennington;
a special train at Bennett; rotary No. 1,
disabled near Bennett; rotary No. 2, one
mile above Glacier.
TACOMA, Jan. 20.â One of the heaviest
snows ever known in Alaska has fallen
In the Lynn Canal section, extending hun
dreds of miles to the interior, down the
Yukon as far as Dawson and probably
below the Klondike metropolis. The
White Pass and Yukon Railroad Is tied
up its entire length, not an engine mov
ing from Skaguay to White Horse, the In

the blockade was brought by the steamer

Snow began falling Monday, January 7,
and with distressing regularity kept com
ing down for the next four or five days.
Wednesday night. January 9, the regular
passenger train arrived at Skaguay four
hours late, having nad an extremely hard
fight to reach Bennett.
The following day came the first actual
tie-up of the season. Beyond Fraser, on
the mountain division of the road; an im
penetrable snowbank brought theÂ»regular
passenger train to a standstill, resisting

SEVERE STORM
IN THE NORTH
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 20.â J. R. Lynch, a
rancher living near the Mexican line, and
his divorced wife, Sela Lynch, were the
principals .In a shooting scrape at mid
night last night. The woman Is In jail in
default of a $400 bond, and the man's left
hand Is in a sling. .
The trouble grew out of the custody of
their 4-year-old child, which was awarded
to the, father at the time a divorce was
granted a month ago. Mrs. Lynch had
eloped from Tla Juana with a man by the
name of Menslr, who deserted his own
wife and family at the same time. They
went to Oceanside, where Mensir was em
ployed for a time on the ranch of Jacob
Gruendike as a horse trainer. It is un
derstood that he has since left the woman
and is now in Arizona.
Because of the desertion with another
man Mr. Lynch secured a divorce, the de
cree having been signed about a month
ago. Â¦ '
Last night, according to the story of
Mrs. Lynch, she went to the ranch to see
her son but be -was not there. Lynch
told her that the boy was In Los Angeles
with his sister, and that he had written to
the sister to keep the child away from Its
mother, even if she should. call there to
see it.' Mrs. "Lynch says that she picked
up a picture of the boy. and when she
learned what her former husband pro
posed to do she crumpled the picture in
her hand and threw, It on the floor. For
this act Lynch had struck her, and be
cause hie seemed. inclined to follow up. the
chastisement she had fired a shot into the
ceiling,' one Into the side of the room and
another into the floor. She said she car
ried the revolver because Lynch had
threatened to- kill her if she did not re
turn to him. â¢-.">â¢
Lynch's story of what happened last
night is quite different from that of his
former wife. He agrees that the dispute
was about the boy. that Mrs.' Lynch came
to the house about 9 o'clock. and that the
shooting took place about midnight. The
intervening time was spent hv a rehearsal
of her -troubles by the woman. . Tne cul
mination came when she. ordered- him to
write ; a note to i his . sister by I which - she
could secure possession of the boy , from
her. He "refused to' write the. order, and
the revolver was then. brought Into play.
Mrs. Lynch will be arraigned before Jus-
I tlce Murdock to-morrow:

The present trial is the Finnell suit and
Is to decide the title to the property.
Tuesday morning, after the jury had been
secured. . Mr.' Finnell was placed on the
stand to : give his ; testimony. In the case.
His counsel introduced a deed which
showed that the land was purchased by
the plaintiff, Â¦ and which Mr. Finnell said
was the instrument by which he came in
to and held possession, of the property In
litigation. Here the defense rested... '
â¢ Numerous witnesses were then called
for,' the; defense. Mr. Saffold was on the
witness' stand. .for Â« several . days relating
how. the place "was to In time be his.'
,The case was given into the hands of the
jury Saturday morning at 11 o'clock, and
it, has '-not -yet agreed upon- a' verdict.
NAPA, Jan. 20.â For a third time the
case of John Finnell vs. R. B. Saffold has
occupied the attention of the Superior
Court and a Jury here during the past
week. The litigation Is over the owner
ship of a large ranch located near Yount
vllle In this county, valued In the neigh
borhood of $30,000. On. account of the
prominence of the two parties the case
has; attracted considerable attention arid
interest among the people of this commu
nity. Finnell Is. the big wheat grower of
Tehama County and Saffold Is his son-ln
law.- Eminent counsel has been employed
by' both parties, and the case has been bit
terly, fought. Mrs. Saffold was one of the.
chief witnesses for the defense, testifying
agaJnst her father. This she did at the
former. trials also. Judge Buckles of So
lano County presided at the present trial,
which began last Tuesday morning.
The evidence was to the effect that in
the '80s the plaintiff engaged his Bon-in
law to run a ranch in Colusa County for
him at a stated salary. But Mrs. Saffold's
health failed, and she was obliged to seek
another climate. Her father agreed, ac
cording . to the testimony, to . release Mr.
Saffold from his contract to superintend
the Colusa ranch, and let them move to,
the Napa County ranch of plaintiff.- The
Saffolds have lived on It ever since, and
many improvements are alleged to have
been made. Saffold claimed that Finnell
had agreed . before he left-. the Colusa
ranch that he (SafCold) was to get the
Napa ranch after he had Improved It and
lived on It so many years, and also made
certain payments to Finnell.
In tho- latter part of last year Saffold
filed suit against Finnell for possession
of the ranch. Then Finnell filed a cross
complaint to have the court set aside the
ranch to him. The Saffold suit was tried
first, and the jury gave a verdict for Fin

When told that Rellly's face was pow

that show that he was coming toward me

He denied that he held his pistol pointed

SAX RAFAEL. Jan. 20.â Exhausted
by a. night's exposure to the rain
and cold, W. F. Warburton, the
slayer of Matthew Reilly, sur
rendered himself at the Sheriff's of
fice in this city this afternoon. He was
driven to the Jail by Matthew Lindsey of
Shaffers Grove, near Ross Landing. Late
in the forenoon he arrived at Lindsey's
place, where he obtained a dry pair of
stockings and took a little rest. Later
he was driven here. He was driven along
Fifth street and taken to the side en
trance of the jail. A large crowd quick
ly assembled, however, and Warburton
was hurried into the Sheriff's office,
where the doors were locked. The halls
of the courthouse were quickly filled with
curious people. After considerable ef
fort on the part of Deputy Sheriffs Mar
tin and Lichtenberg \he building was
closed and tho doors locked.
When searched a 32-caliber revolver was
found in the waistband of Warburton's
trousers. It was fully loaded, the empty
shell from last night's shooting having
been replaced by a fresh one. In his
pockets were also found $36 40. All through
the searching and locking up in the cell
below the accused man was as cool as
usual. He smiled and Bmoked cigarettes,
never exhibiting the slightest concern ex
cept when the people flocked Into the
building. He seemed to be laboring un
der the impression that an attempt would
be made to mob him.
Several hours later Sheriff Taylor and
District Attorney Mclsaac interviewed
him in the upper office. An effort was
made to secure a statement from him con
cerning the shooting. He declined firm
ly but politely to discuss his case, saying
that at the proper time he would talk.
"While in the Sheriff's office he posed for
a Call artist for a sketch. He took much
interest in the growth of the picture, and
asked to be allowed to correct it. Taking
the pencil he shaded a little here and
with the rubber erased certain features
that did not please him.
In an interview to-night he said: "No
man who is a man can stand the sting
of slander. For several months I have
been held up In this community as base
and vile. Things too vile to repeat have
Masuras was examined by the police
and as a result the warrants were issued.
Joseph and James KSptaukas and Frank
Hestaigus were arrested by the police.
One other Yonkers man and two New
Yorkers were named on other warrants
and the police are searching for them.
The police assert that they believe the
story told, by Masuras and they say that
the affair has led to the discovery of an
anarchist band of a dangerous character.
Masuras was apparently willing to tell
more about the society, but Judge Kel
logg adjourned the hearing and committed
the prisoner to Jail pending further ex
amination. :'â¢â¢
On the stand Masuras said that In
Greece he had been a member of an
anarchist society. Some time ago it fell
to his lot to kill a public man In the
United States and he was ordered to come
to this country and place himself under
the orders of the American branch of the
society. He had never heard the name
of the man he was to murder and un
derstood that as in other cases the man
who was to be the victim was to be
selected after his arrival in this country.
After reaching America Masuras, accord
ing to his own story, went to Yonkers and
affiliated himself with a branch of the or
ganization, as well as one in New York.
Finally he became lrightened, withdrew
and .refused to carry Out the mission en
trusted to him. From the time he left
the organization he claims he wan an
noyed and threatened by members of the
society. He remained firm In his deter
mination not to obey the orders, how
ever, and yesterday eix of the men came
here and beg-ged him to return. When he
still refused one of the six, Â¦which one he
could not say, attempted to stab him.
The blow was aimed too high, however.
NEW YORK. Jan. 20.â Ellas Masuras,
a Greek, the complainant In an assault
case which came before Judge Kellogg
of Yonkers. N. Y., this morning, told a
startling tale of a plot of Greek anarch
ists to kill prominent Americans and
would have told more had the court not
stopped him and turned him over to the
police that they might quietly investi
gate the cas>e. Several arrests have al
ready been made and a number more are
planned.

The Chilean Minister to Bolivia has left <
his post on leave, iut it Is understood
that he will be directed to return to La
Par, perhaps, with new propositions. The
reported rejection by the Chilean Con
gress of the protocol relative to the
plebiscite to be held in the provinces of
Tacna and Arica. has not been confirmed
and It is believed here that foe notion
taken was rather in the way of a refusal
to give approval to the instrument. As
suming this to be the case, it Is said that
the matter will return to a stage of nego
tiation and Chile will make a strong effort
to secure a peaceful solution.
ANARCHIST BAND
IS DISCOVERED
"The Government of Chile," he said, "in
a circular to the diplomatic corps of
Chile, dated September 29 last, has stated
Its policy and the attitude It will observe
with regard to the difficulties pending
between Chile and Bolivia and Chile and
Peru. According to that document,
which has been communicated to all for
eign governments, the intentions of Chile
toward Bolivia are most respectful and
most generous. There is no word even
of denunciation of the treaty of truce,
no word of the partition of Bolivia. On
the contrary, the Intention expressed by
Chile in that document is that of finding
some means of satisfying Bolivia in a
way that may be compatible with the
vital necessities and interests of Chile.
We offer Bolivia a railroad, we offer free
entrance for Bolivian goods, we offer pay
ment of external debts, all of which will
cost Chile from $14,uOO.OC9 to $16,000,000. In
addition, we offer her very favorable
commercial treaties and franchises. Chile
getting in return only the most favored
treatment and recognition of our sover
eignty over the geographical degree of
territory which Chile cannot part with be
cause it would endanger her existence.
The representative of the Minister for
Foreign Affairs in Peru cannot possibly
have placed himself In antagonism to his
chief by proposing the partition of Boli
via when he has just received the diplo
matic circular to which I have re
ferred."
The controversy between Chile, Bolivia
and Peru is acknowledged to be In a seri
ous etage. but it is asserted that the San
tiago Government is making an earnest
effort to bring about a pacific settlement.
Senor I>on Carlos Morla Vicuna, Chilean
Minister in Washington, says the Chilean
Minister in Lima could not have proposed
to Peru the partition of Bolivia because
Euch a proposal would be in direct viola
tion of the diplomatic circular sent by
Chile to the powers regarding the contro
versy with Bolivia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Bolivia, who urged the acceptance of the
Chilean proposal, has, in consequence of
the adverse action of Congress of his
country, resigned his office.

which the latter was wounded.
A duel followed between Count de Lu

on April 12 of last year, in which the lat

In the first bout.
Letters of Baron Robert to his seconds
and to thÂ» Count added fuel to the flames
end the Count announced his purpose to

to Baron Robert's cousin. Baron Edouard
dÂ» Rothschild, son of Baron Alphonse de
Rothschild, stating that as the son of the
head of the Rothschild family he should
hold him responsible and should insult
him at their first meeting.
Ill feeling was revived after they left
co'.lege by an expression attributed to
Baron Robert de Roihsehild respecting
Count de Lubersac, wh.ch was repeated
to the iatter socn efter his admission to
the Jockey Club. The Count then wrota
a letter in which he s-nnounced himself
ready to meet the Baron on tbe field of
honor, although, as ho expressed it, "you
know how you and your people inspire me
with disgust."

encounter had failed because of the re
fusal of Count de Lubtrsac's seconds to
â¢allow the duel to take place when thev
discovered that Baron de Rothschild waÂ»
etlll a minor.
The Rothschlld-L-ubertac Incident. whlc?i
brought out a remarkable crop of dueis,
had its origin In a boy's quarrel dating
Crom the lime when Count de L.ubersac
and Baron de Rothschild were at the
fame college. They quarreled one day In
repard to a tennis court which was oc
cupied by Rothschild and which Count de
Lubersac wanted. During the quarrel
Lubersac called his adversary "Sale Julf"
(dirty Jew).
The duel began at 11 o'clock and lasted
ten minutes, when Count de Lubersac re
ceived a lunge perforating his arm at the
elbow to the arm Dit. The duel was then
stopped. Both the Count and the Baron
fought determinedly; neither flinched and
neither showed the shEhttst desire n
spare the other. Sixteen engagements
t<xjk place, all of a desperate character.
The combatants attackeu each other furi
ously. The sleeves ot ihcir shirts were
literally torn to pieces by the points of
their Swords as the duelists repeatedly
lunged at each other. Several times they
came to close Quarters and tneir seconds
were obliged to separate them.

to clear away the marital muddle created by Reno
marriages by repealing the law which raised the row.
Recent developments indicate that the bill will have
the _ advocacy of an army of couples 'who have only
concluded their honeymoon in the Sierras.
Our worthy legislators at Sacramento have already
introduced measures providing for considerably more
than half a million dollars in appropriations. Before
they return to their homes they will be very firmly
convinced that there is a big difference sometimes be
tween what a fellow wants and what he gets.
A bill has been introduced in the Legislature at
Sacramento making it illegal for any one to have
lobsters in his possession from April 1 to August 15.
This measure seems to be a serious injustice, sinct
from the peculiar mental make-up of some of our
statesmen they insist upon being with us always.

The issue is not a; slight one. It involves some

It is to be borne in mind that the frauds which
have been exposed do* not stand alone as isolated
cases. On the contrary there ,ls around each one of
them a web; of suspicious circumstances which sug
gests that there are other frauds bound up with those
that have been revealed. Not until the whole tangled
web has been unraveled can it be determined to
what extent the State has suffered loss; nor can it
be decided upon whom the blame shall rest.
From the facts that have been disclosed there can
be drawn the conclusion, amounting to a moral cer
tainty, that something like a- conspiracy has existed
between certain officials at the prison and certain
parties in this city to defraud the State, and the
conspiracy has been worked successfully for a long
time by reason of the lax methods of supervision at
the prison. With such facts already exposed a public
examination and investigation is necessary in order
that the people may know accurately who has been
negligent of duty, who has been criminal and who
should be condemned.
In an interview' with a representative of The Call
on Saturday, Warden Aguirre spoke of the examin
ation now being carried on by experts as a matter
whose results might or might not be made public. \\z
said: "When they have finished their examination
they will report to the Directors. If the Directors
then see fit to make known the result of the .investi
gation, the public will through the columns of the
newspapers know the condition of affairs. The report
if given out will be read at a public meeting."
That statement was of course quite proper from
the Warden, for of course authority to make known
the report of the experts rests with the Directors of
the prison, and not with him. Nevertheless there
is too much of uncertainty in the statement to be satis
factory. At this juncture it should not be left to the
discretion of any one to determfne whether the people
of California shall know how San Quentin Prison has
been managed. It should be understood from thÂ»
start that the people have a right to know the whole
truth, so that they may know how such frauds could
have been carried on for so long a time without de
tection.
1 >^ ISCLOSURES made concerning the manage-
I ) ment, or mismanagement, of San Quentin
* â /{.. Prison are sufficient to justify the public de
mand for a comprehensive investigation of the whole
subject. The real issue now before the Legislature
is not whether there shall be an investigation, but.
how the required investigation can be made most
speedily and most effectively.

actions were somewhat larger, though the deman-i

flocks in the South. The boot and shoe trade was
reported in good shape, and leather was firm. Hides,
however, were weak. There was some depressing
sentiment in the iron trade, with indications of fric
tion between the emplo3-ers and men on the subject
of wages. Orr the other hand the railroads keep up
their increase in earnings, and the retail trade has'
rot declined as much cs usual at this time of the year.
Our local situation stands the same as for weeks.
Both wholesale and retail business arc reported good
and the export trade of the port continues large.
Money is in ample supply, failures are few and gen

The weather is all that could be desired by the farmer

good showing during the week. The retail business
was Teported active, except in heavy winter goods,
and the bank clearings showed an increase of 52.3 per
cent over the same week last year, this being the
largest increase for many months. The gain at New
York was 77.3 per cent and at Pittsburg 33.6, and
every important city in the country except Milwaukee
?.r.d St. Paul exhibited a gain. This is a very fine
showing for the condition of business throughout the
country, and is a much better record than that made
by the failures, which were 325, against 242 for' the

The liquidation in sto'eks in Wall street accom
panied the first reaction since the election, a period of
over two months. Ostensibly this liquidation was
caused by disappointment over the failure of certain
anticipated railroad deals to materialize, but it was
admitted that the heavy speculation of the past two
months had led into the market many speculators
whose holdings had become too extended, and whose
margins were weak. Some large speculators became
bearish and began to sell short; the public grew wary
and commenced to withdraw; the banks and other
controlling interests, while not selling, did not over
exert themselves to protect their properties in the
face of the growing liquidation, and realizing on an
extensive scale set in. The situation was peculiar, inas
much as the condition of the money market did not
appear to cut much of a figure in the liquidation.

materially affect the present situation. It was the
general belief that the liquidation was merely tempo
rary and devoid of se:ious significance.
LIQUIDATION was the feature of trade last
week. There was liquidation in wheat at Chi

previous fortnight Wall street interests, supposedly
led by Keene, purchased large lines of wheat on the
Chicago Board of Trade, Early last week under
bearish aspects of the market the Chicago holders sold
out to a man, but the Wall street interests held on.
In a d?.y or so, however, the latter also began to let
go, and by Saturday the whole line had been quietly

It is to be borne in mind in this connection that
the Republican platform adopted at Philadelphia last
June declares: "The Dingley act, amended to pro
vide sufficient revenue for the conduct of the war, has
so well performed its work that it has been possible
to reduce the war debt in the sum of $40,000,000. Sr>
ample are the Government's revenues and so great
is the public confidence in the integrity of its obli
gations that its newly funded two per cent bonds sell
at. a premium. The country is now justified in ex
pecting, and it will be the policy of the Republican
party to bring about, n reduction of the war revenues."
The people being justified by that pledge in expect
ing a reduction of taxes, it behooves the Republicans
of the Senate to act with the House in keeping the
pledge. The treasury is already overloaded with
money. A surplus of $20,000,000 in six months is too
much. The money will be much more useful in the
hands of the people and in the channels of trade.
Such being the situation, it would appear thai
Hoards of Trade and ether industrial and commercial
organizations of the people would be justified in urg-'
ing the Senate to take action upon the. bill at this
session. There is seemingly no reason why the tax
should not be reduced at least to the extent recom
mended by. Secretary Gage. The surplus revenue
for the first half of the current fiscal year amounts 10
upward of $20,000,000, and, that being so, there 5s
certainly no reason why the more vexatious taxes of
the war revenue act should continue.
While the correspondent of the American Econo
mist is of the opinion the Senate will act upon the
Â¦jbill; and the Times m?n is inclined to believe there
will be no action, they agree that a considerable pres
sure is being brought upon the Senators by the beer
and the tobacco men to have the tax upon their
products lightened, if not- removed altogether. In
tact, the writer for the Economist says: "The pressure
for a still further reduction in the beer tax down to
$1 50 continues, and seems likely to succeed. This
piospect has encouraged the tobacco manufacturers
to make strong efforts for further reductions in th*
taxes on their commodities.'-
A still more unfavorable report of the situation is
made by the Washington correspondent of the New
York Times. He says: "At the treasury the notion
is entertained that there will not be any reduction
at all in the revenues for the next fiscal year â that is,
until after June 30, 1Q02â and he adds: "A Senator
on the Finance Committee said that it was his impres
sion, from hints offered to him, that when required
to choose between a bill that took off $40,000,000 or
nothing, the Finance Committee decided that it should
be nothing. Then the pressure of beer men and
ether interests to be taken care of by the Senate has
made it difficult to report the bill as passed by the
House."
The reason given foi the delay on the part of the
Senate is that the administration is unwilling to lose
so large a portion of the war revenue as the House
bill surrenders. It will be remembered that Secretary
Gage recommended a reduction of $30,000,000, or $10.
000,000 less than the reduction proposed by the
House. Some members of the Senate committee, it
is said, will favor reductions not exceeding those ad
vised by the Secretary of the Treasury; while others,
who are willing to go as far as the House went in the
way of reducing taxes, are opposed to the way in
which the reductions were made and will insist upon
changing the House bill with respect to many im
portant items.
When the reduction bill went up from the House
:i was at once refe-red to the Senate Committee oil
Finance, and there it has been held ever since. The
Washington correspondent of the American Econo
mist says it is understood to be the purpose of the
Senate committee to make such radical changes" in
the measure that the Ways and Means Committee of
the House which framed the bill will not recognize
it when it comes back from the Senate.
THE SENATE AN J THE WAR TAXES.
WHEN the House of Representatives revised
the war revenue act and reduced the taxes im
posed by it to an amount estimated at $40,000,
000 a year there was general gratification throughout
the country. It now appears, however, that the Sen
ate is not likely, to approve so great a reduction in
revenue, and a prolonged contest on the subject may
take place between the two Houses.

SOCIETY:
MOST GRACEFUL ACT
OF A SOLDIERS BRIDE
BY SALLY SHARP.
While in our democratic philosophy we hold there
is no essential difference between royal blood and
common blood, we cannot be indifferent to the fact
that high station gives to personal influence a far
reaching power that affects the minds of men who
are not by any means directly subject to the rule of
that person. Victoria, from the greatest throne on
earth, has affected society wherever civilization exists.
Consequently we in America have lost something in
the passing of a woman whose influence has been so
helpful and so yood, and may well share in the sor
row of her people.
Arnericans cannot understand the loyalty which
from British hearts c oes out so abundantly to their
sovereign, and which has been toward Victoria inter
fused with feelings of reverence for her pure woman
hood manifested at every period of her career, and
of love for that motherly quality which in later years
has shown itself in her dealings with her people. Her
death is going to be mourned with a profounder
sorrow than has ever attended the death of any other
sovereign since the world began. It is going to be
felt as a personal loss in homes all over the globe,
from the frozen wilds of Northern Canada, through
out India and tropic islands, in the East and the West
Indies, southward to the far stations where the British
banner flies from posts almost within the sweep of the
Antarctic Circle.
Such being the case, it is natural the people of
the wide-spread empire of Great Britain should look
upon the Victorian era with the proudest patriotic
gratification, and note every sign of its passing with
more than ordinary sorrow. The greatest era in
British history virtually began with Victoria's reign
and will close with the closing of that reign. The
passing away of the great sovereign Queen and
Empress corresponds so closely with the passing of
British supremacy in the world that the one event
can hardly fail to appear a symbol of the other.
place among the nations.
When the last guns fired on the field of Waterloo
scattered the final rally of Napoleon, Great Britain
stood not only victor on the field but as the great
est of the 'nations of Europe. At that moment of
supremacy the British people had the wisdom to usa
their energies and their power for commercial and in
dustrial enterprises rather than for military under
takings. In a comparatively short time they made
their country the foremost manufacturing nation on
the globe, and their proud claim upon the empire of
the seas was justified by their commerce even more
than by their navies. Thus Great Britain advanced
from a European to a "world power," and during th?
whole of the Victorian era she^has held the foremost
place among the nations.
Signs and portents along the horizon all around
the globe and visible from every point of vjew give,
warning to the British that their supremacy is about
to end. They will doubtless be absolutely more rich
and more powerful :n the future than in the past,
for they are not by any means a decadent people;
but their rivals in the United States and in Russia,
and also in Germany, are growing faster than them
selves. In a time not far distant supremacy in Europe
will pass to Germany, dominion in Asia will be ;n
the hands of Russia, and the empire of the seas will
be controlled in war and in commerce by ships that
bear the banntr of the United States.
It is true that the past century was in its thirty
seventh year when Victoria ascended the throne, but
those early years constituted a period of reaction
from the strenuous Napoleonic wars, and were not
strongly marked by that tremendous human move
ment which distinguishes the nineteenth century. a f ter
the civilized nations had recovered from the effects
of the old wars and started forward on the path of
utilitarianism, guided by science and stimulated by
liberty. As a consequence the Victorian era covers
nearly the whole period occupied in bringing about
that vast revolution in commerce, industry, politics
and philosophy which has so materially changed
human conditions as to virtually constitute a new
civilization.
BY a coincidence of some interest the Victorian
era of British history will correspond almost
exactly with the nineteenth, century, and the
era of Edward VII will begin with the twentieth, if,
indeed, the reign of the coming King should prove
long enough and important enough to constitute
an era.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 20.â ine Senate
Finance Committee was In session the
greater part of to-day making an effort
to complete consideration of the war rev
enue reduction bill In order to be able to
present Its report to-morrow. Ii did not
Bucceed, but the work was so nearly com
pleteu that it Is believed one or two more
meetings will suffice for that purpose.
There are still many Items of the bill
which have not been finally passed upon,
but all of them have been so completely
canvassed that there will not be great
difficulty In reaching- a conclusion. The
committee is still withholding official an
nouncement of its proceedings from the
public, but some facts concerning Its con
clusions are known. It Is not probable
that there will be a very much greater
total reduction than was made by the bill
as it passed the House, but the reduction
will be differently distributed. .The most
important conclusion reached is to re
duce from 19 to 9 cents the tax on tobac
co. There is also to be a reduction of the
tax on Jtigars and snuff. The House left
all these articles untouched. The Senate
committee's decision as to those articles
will reduce the revenue receipts about $10,
000.000. This reduction will be made up
by declining to accept all the House re
ductions. Consequently all the articles
from which the House took off all the tax
will be given half the former rate by the
Senate committee.
It is probable that on proprietary arti
cles, the formulae of which Is public, the
tax will be entirely removed, while upon
those, the formulae of which is secret, the
tax will be retained entirely. The tax on
steamship tickets will be reduced. The
tax on steerage tickets will be removed
entirely. The tax on stock transfers prob
ably will be continued on the par value of
the shares as at present, but this matter
has not been definitely passed upon.
The members of the committee express
the opinion that to place the tax upon the
selling value of stocks would be an invi
tation to fraud. The beer tax has been
discussed at considerable length, but no
absolute decision has been reached. The
present tendency is to leave the rate as
fixed . by the House. The tax on tele
grams also remains undecided. Some of
the members have made an effort to- have
the law amended so as to reduce the tax
to a half-cent >, per message, but to make
the â¢ telegraph companies pay it. This
proposition has not been accepted In Ita
entirety, but the reduction seems prob
able. v
The form of the bill will be altered ma
terially. ,

If then the word "hero" means an Ideal j
being of imaginary perfections, we may
admit at once that Shakespeare has no
heroes. And this is. the meaning that
Ruskin seems to attach to It. But the
word Is really the equivalent of the Latin
"vir," and means, first of all, a man. .Not
that every man was a hero, even in the
beginning. Only for freeborn men. for
men worthy of honor, especially for war
riors, is the word used by Homer. Later
.generations came to attach to this word
"a connotation of superhuman, or seml
dlvtne. humanity, ana this unreal aspect
has made Itself apparent from time to
time in literature, notably in such figures
as Sir Galahad to the Grail romances, in
the superhuman characters of Dryden s
so-called heroic plays. In Sir Charles
Grandison and his limitless progeny In fic
tion. But the true sense of the word re
mains to-day very near what It was in
Homer's timeâ a hero is a man remark
able Tor bravery or greatness of soul a
man admired and venerated for his noble
qualities.
Now, Shakespeare is our greatest poet,
perhaps also our greatest thinker and
teacher. It would be a terrible testimony
against humanity if his eye, sweeping all
the varied ways of men. found no hero in
them all. But what reader of Shakespeare
cannot call to mind name after name of
men remarkable for bravery and great
ness of soul? And our task now is not so
much to demonstrate that there are he
roes in Shakespeare as to consider the
qualities that make these men heroic. .
In Shakespeare's earliest plays we flnn
no truly- heroic figures. There Is Indeed,
no place for them In such light and grace
ful work as "Love's Labor'3 Lost and
"Two Gentlemen of Verona." or In the,
rude and unformed h.storles that deal
with the wars of the roses. In "Richard
III" the whole interest of the dramatist
is centered en the great central figure of
the usurping King. To have made a hero
of Richmond, his antagonist, would have
distracted too much the attention of the
1 reader and marred the unity of the play.
Romeo is an unformed youth, possessing
indeed some of the noblest qualities â
bravery courtesy, fidelity to a friend, pas
sionate devotion to a mistressâ but he has
not the power to fuse these qualities into
a whole of heroic manhood, and through
out the play he is the sport of an un
kindly fate. It is not until we reach the
best If not perhaps the latest, play of the
first period that we meet the first of
Shakespeare's heroesâ Duke Theseus of
I "Midsummer Night's Dream."
I Theseus Is Shakespeare's study of the
I hero in repose. He does little in the play.
i but he is much. Around him cluster all
the figures of the actionâ Oberon and Tita
1 nla have come from fairyland to honor his
nuptials, the rude mechanic crew of
Athens strain their poor abilities to pleas
ure him and the destinies of the mortal
lovers hang upon his words. And he is
worthy of his place, a noble lover, a just
judge a kindly ruler over his people. He
has the large utterance of the antique
worldâ calm, self-possessed, incapable of
meanness. His character seems to have
haunted the mind of Shakespeare, for he
returned to it in the last years of his life.
In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" the "same
kindly and knightly Duke Theseus rises
before us, a stronger and a more heroic
figure. In the larger canvass of the later
drama, there Is room for the display of
qualities only guessed at in the earlfer.
and we find here, not a portrait of the
hero in repose, but a splendid presentment
of the hero in action, the warrior vrho
fights to redress not only his own wrongs
but another's, the victor who pours balm
into the wounds of his enemies. 'the calm
arbiter between the fury of contending
rivals. And the deeper note, which runs
through all Shakespeare's latest work, of
reverent wonder at the mysteries of life
is not lacking in this just and gentle fig
ure. It Is no mere soldier or man of the
world who winds up the tragic tale of
Palomon and Arclte with the address to
the gods that Shakespeare has put into
the mouth of Theseus.
Shakespeare's next hero is cast in a very
different mold, "the pattern of a perfect
.If an essay on this subject were to be
written by a devout believer in the gos
pel according to Ruskin it would be as
short as the famous chapter on "Snakes
In Ireland." "Shakespeare has no heroes,"
says the great apostle of the beautiful;
"he has only heroines."
There Is Indeed a certain grain of truth
in this statement, as there is In all that
Ruskin says. Shakespeare's men lack the
ideal beauty of his womankind- They are
more faulty in manners and In morals,
more prone to error and to misdoing. But
their very faults testify to their human
ity. Shakespeare, 'it would seem, was more
Interested in men than in women. He
studied them more closely and drew their
portraits with more scrupulous care for
reality. Shakespeare's men are the pro
duct of his Imagination working upon the
materials afforded him by H'e; his women,
with some few exceptions, are the crea
tures of his free Imagination.

play grows darker and more bloody his

and his tender pity shine out like stars
against the gloomy blackground of tha

Ing faith of the English nobles. For an

for the noble Beatrice is seen from the be
plnninjr struggling against his prejudices
and his fear of a scornful repulse, the
trick by which the two are brought to
pether "is only a part of the comic action
of the playâ the real bond of their union
Is their common sympathy for a slandered
lady When Hero's lover deserts her at
the altar, when her credulous father
pours out reproaches upon her shame.
Benedick alone of the men who gather
round refuses to believe the story of her
guilt His quick wit suspects the source
of slander and his true heart accepts thn
solemn asseveration of Beatrice as proof
conclusive of her cousin's innocence. Once
satisfied of the justice of his cause, his
way Is clear; he breaks with his former
friends and challenges Claudlo with a
fixed composure that only half conceals
the horest anger of his heart. AH the
world knows how the slander is revealed
and the duel averted, and all the world
feels sure that had It come to blows Ben
edick -would have carved his petulant,
boyish adversary like the veriest capon
ever served upon a Prince's table. There
is something unsatisfactory to the mod
ern miml In the patched-up marriage of
Claudlo and Hero, the device which makes
"much ado about nothing" of all the
slander and Injured Innocence and noble
resentment of the play, but there la m>
tinge of dissatisfaction In the union of
Benedick and Beatrice. Both brave, both
witty, both generous and sincere, their
earlier reluctance Is a "better pledge of
happiness in marriage than the soon
fired, sooh-quenched passion of Claudio
for his bride.

The Labor Council convened In extra
session >esterday afternoon and declared.
a boycott against certain store? proprie
tors who have persistently refused to
comply with the requests of the Retail
C'erks" I'nion and grant their employes
shorter hours. Since the crusade for
shorter hours was Inaugurated the ma
jority of clothing stores have agreed to
close. Only a few now remain open and
it is against these that the boycott is
launched. This action on the part of the
union has been impending for a number
of days. On Friday a meeting was h?ld
and the proprietors were sent warning
that they must accede or the union Tien
would be forbidden to patronize their
stores. The offending proprietors claim
that compliance means Irreparable injury
to them, inasmuch as the greater part of
their bUFiriess is transacted after the clos
ing hour, prescribed by the union.
Boycott Declared.
The committee was allowed until Sun
day next to complete the constitution and
by-laws.
The matter of initiation fees also pro
voked a lengthy argument. It was finally
decided to place the charter fees at $5
for each union in the organization.
The committee appointed to draft a
constitution and by-laws for the govern-
Tnent of the City Front Federation, which
embraces all the trades and crafts di
rectly connected with the shipping inter
ests of the port, made a progressive re
port yesterday afternoon* to the general
body. The committee report was the
subject of four hours' discussion, the
principal matter of debate being the sec
tion relating to the representation to be
given each organization in the federa
tion.
It was the opinion of the majority of
the members of the committee that there
should be a system of proportionate rep
resentation. They recommended that
each organization be allowed one repre
sentative in the federation and one ad
ditional representative for each 100 mem
bers or fractional part less than 100,
providing, however, that no society be
entitled to more than ten representatives.
This part of the report was strongly ob
jected to by the majority of, the delegates
present. They argued that there should
not be any discrimination In the matter
of representation in the federation. It
was the opinion of the majority that each
organization should ha.ve .the same rep
resentation. It was contended that large
orpanlzatior.s. like the Sailors' Union,
would be entitled to ten representatives,
while some of the unions embraced in the
federation would not be entitled to more
than two delegates under the proportion-
U system. The opponents of the system
argued that if it was adopted there would
always? exist the danger of two or more
large organizations combining and over
riding the wishes of smaller unions. After
a discussion lasting over two hours it
was decided to amend the committee re
port In that respect and give each organ
ization three delegates, irrespective of
the membership of the unions. v

"With Senate Amendments.
WASHINGTON, Ian. 20.â The House
will devote most of its attention durin?
the coming week to appropriation bills,
most of them for the District of Columbia,
fortifications, naval, oostofflce and ag
rucultural departments being ready for
consideration. At the outset, however,
there will be day or two given to other
measures having right of way.
.The army reorganization bill will be re
ported back promptly from the Committee
on Military Affairs, probably to-morrov;,
and sent to conference with a general dis
agreement to all Senate amendments. It
may be reported back durinp the latter
part of the week and a sharp contest 13
promised, Richardson of Tennessee, the
minority leader, having Intimated that
there will be a discussion of each para
graph.
The Distlct of Columbia is entitled to
to-morrow and will soek to hold the day
to the consideration of local measures.
The bulky postal codification bill Is als.->
before the House as a continuing order
and will require mucn of the time not
given to appropriation bills. Efforts an*
making to have the bill to promote the
efficiency of the revenue cutter service
made a special order for Tuesday.
The appropriation bills above referred
to will consume the time during the rest
of the week, except Friday, which Is pri
vate pension day, and Saturday, when eu
logies to the memory of the" late Senator
Gear of Iowa will be pronounced.
Report on' Army Bill Will Disagree
Renewed efforts will be made Monday or
Tuesday in executive session to secure
the confirmation of J. S. Harlan as At
torney General for Porto Rico and also
to secure ratification of the treaty with
Spain for the cession of the remaining
islands of the Philippine group.
WORK BEFORE THE HOUSE.
Morgan has not indicated his purpose
with reference to the Nicaragua canal
bill, but his friends say that he will de
lay a reasonable time and that if England
does not act upon the amendments to the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty he then will, move
consideration of the canal bill.
Aldnch, chairman of the Finance Com
mittee, probably will report the war rev
enue reduction bill on Tuesday and he
will ask immediate consideration for that
measure. The rulea of the Senate give
preference to revenue bills, as they do to
appropriation bills, and no order- of th*
Senate will be necessary to make a place
for that bill. It is not probable that any
effort will be made to displace appropria
tion bills with that measure, but all Sen
ators seem united in the opinion that it
necessarily must become a law during the
session, and if there should be an oc
casion when it woui'I be necessary to de
cide between it an.l some bill other than
an appropriation bill the preference al
most certainly would be given to the rev
enue bill. Ine present impression, how
ever, is that this bill will be soon disposed
of. Democratic Senators probably will
make an effort to secure additional reduc
tions, but falling in this will vote for the
bill. The pension and military academy
appropriation bills are also on the calen
dar and will receive early attention. The
Indian appropriation bill will be reported
early in the week, but will not be pressed.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20.â The Senate
will take up the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill Monday as soon
as possible after convening. There is lit
tle in the bill that ordinarily would create
debate, but it does not seem improbable
that several days may be required to act
on it because of the desire on the part
of some Senators to postpone considera
tion of the ship subsidy bill as long- as
possible. The shipping bill will be made
the unfinished business whenever, in the
opinion of the friends of that measure, it
is wise to give it that place: but in view
of the fact that it will be displaced by
appropriation bills whenever Senators in
charge of these measures. desire to take
them up, it is probable that the motion to
give the bill the place of vantage will be
postponed until after the consideration of
the legislative bill. , .

Power has arranged a very attractive
card for the opeot&S day and despite thai
discouraging weather outlook the fields
give promise of affording some excellent
sport. In addition to five flat events a
hurdle number is down for decision.
One result of Saturday's race at Oak

will be to detract just one-half as a draw-

Christmas day he woi: the Westchester

picked up 119 pounds and took down the
Juvenile Champion stake ,%also at seven
furlongs, while behind him came Can
more. Rolling Boer, Golden Age. Kenil

that from an obscure maiden in November
the Prince's horse has shown steady and
pronounced improvement until to-day he
is probably the best of the three-year
olds in training. In the mud Articulat?
is better than an ordinary colt, but is not
to be mentioned in the same breath wiih
a Crescendo or an El Rio Rev. Canmoro
is both game and fast, but like a called

America has caused the wise ones to
study a bit. Of late he has been improv
ing greatly in his work, and he Is about
due to add his name to the list of win
ners. He is a brother of Palo Alto and
Ireland, and those who have been watch
ing him feel that he will sustain the fam
ily reputation.
Warpath and Greenhall performed well,
but were unfortunate in getting hard
courses at critical times.
Though she won the course, to follow
with severe work against Palo Alto in
his great form was considered too much,
and she was withdrawn.
Palo Alto, the speediest of the get of
the greatest of sires, Emln Pasha, an
nexed the 128-dog open stake at the
Union Coursing Park yesterday, going
through the finals at such a heart-break
ing pace that his strongest opponent ap
peared a weakling against him.
Fast as "ever, the great courser seemed
encowed with considerable more lire and
flash than he has heretofore displayed,
and he virtually ran away from the
best in the stake. The ofl-fjuoted pre
diction when Palo Alto is entered In an
event that if at himself there would be
nothing to touch him was amply verified
yesterday.
Snapshot, v.'ho ran with him in the
morning, managed to ecore two points
against the ilyer, but after that and un
til the victory was awarded* to Geary's
dog-, by the withdrawal of Lady Claire
Judge Grace was saved the trouble of
counting pcints scored except for Palo
Alto. In all his work the winner con
sumed SI seconds in bringing his five
courses to a linish and landing first
prize in the event. N â¢
l>ady Claire, by reaching second
place, added more glory and fame
to the record of the king of
sires. She showed fast and strong, and
many thought she might have a fair
chance in the final. Luck was against
her. however, for in the semi-finals, after
having beaten Wedgewood against the
judgment of the form players, she was
given the hardest kind of going by Ki
caslo in a bye. â¢

SILVER WINGS
ON FIGHT MONEY
Strange Disappearance Out
of the Guarantee Fund
Is a Puzzle.
Two Hundred Dollars Is Missing
and No Accounting Can Be
Made for the
. ' Mystsry.
When Manager Rattigan. who looks out
for the interests of pugilist George Byers,
and Manager Lou Hcuseman, who keeps
an eye on Jack Root's pugilistic welfare,
â¢divided up the money that came to them
frcm the fight Friday night they found
themselves $200 shy. Where the money
went is a mystery which 19 not solved.
Piled up in glistening gold and shinlns
sliver J. J. Groom counted out $3000 a.s
the guarantee money before the Crlbb-
Thurston tornado blew over the ropes.
Houseman's and RattSgan's representa
tives were eatisned with the count. After
that they counted the money again and
all that was in the measured pile was
J2S0O. Several times they counted the
money and the repetition brought the
same, addition on every occasion. Where
the money went nobody knows. Groom
tagged up $3000 on his count before the
representatives of Rattigan and House
man and they were satlsiled that the pile
represented $3000.
When Groom counted out the money
originally, measuring it out In stacks as
it came into the box office, he laid away
J3000 for the guaranteed amount. One
of the men who was there in represensa
tlve capacity said there was but S2S0O In
the pile. Then It was that Groom counted
it out officially and all were satisfied thaÂ»
the full $3000 waa there. In the presence
of all the third count was made and J2O)
was missing. Subsequent counts showed
the same amount. Groom was watched by
the representatives of Houseman and
Rattigan, each one of them kept an eye
upon the other and Groom on both.
Where did the money go? The pile was
made up of $1000 in gold and the rest In
silver. Houseman says it's a mystery
which his brain -cannot solve. Groom says
he counted out the $3000 and the others
say they saw him do It. The other counts
showed the deflclP, but where that $200
went is a problem in projectile disappear
ance.
San Diego Now Has an Almost In-
SOUTHERN TEAM STRONG.
vincible InnÂ»ld.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 20.â The arrival of
Truck Eagan to play with the San Diego
team in the winter league has made quite
a change in the team. Eagan and Dever
eaux are the shortstop and third-baseman
of the winning Sacramento team and they
will hold down those two positions for
San Diego. "With Arrellanes of Oakland
on second and Mike Donlin of St. LouH
on nrst the southernmost team In the
State has about as invincible an ln
fleld as could be put together.
Bowman, who was with the Oaklands
last year, has not been re-signed by Cal
Ewing and it is said that he was dropped
on account of his batting, or rather, on
account of his failure to hit the ball. It
must have been a failure in the North
ern League, for he has not failed down
here. He has been smashing the ball out
for two and three bags right along, and
he has more "homers" to his credit than
any one In the league thus far.
Frank Chance has returned from Fresno
and is again in the game." His head hurt
him a great deal after he was hit by the
pitcher in one of the Los Angeles games
and he thought that he was out of it -for
a month or two at least, but the pain has
left and he has come back. ' He desires to
remain in the play in Southern California
In order to be in good condition for the
opening of the season in the East.
Mike Donlln has not been placed yet,
but hopes to be able to remain on the
coast next summer. Seville, one of the
pitchers of the San Bernardino team, is
one of the blacklisted boys and will not
be able to play in the Northern League
when it opens.
There is a wee bit of a girl up at the
home of Catcher Tom Works of the San
Diego team, and she is only nine days
old. She is charged up with no errors on
the scorebook, but the fans declare thac
she is responsible for the loss of three
games for the San Diego team. In two
games Tom did not catch because of the
expected arrival of the baby, and In the
third he did not catch because she had
Just arrived. Substitute catchers had to
be put in and none of them could hold
Pitcher Taylor. In the three game3 the
catchers are charged with six errors and
eight passed balls, and that was where
the games went. Tom doesn't like to see
games lost, but he declares that the babe
is worth half a dozen at least.

MOVEMENT OF REAL ESTATE
IN AND ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO
Edward Llchtenberg, who has the con
tract to supply the dan Quentin Prison
with jute for the mill, was seen yester
dav at his residence at 2520 Green street.
"I knew very little of Walden," hÂ«
said. "I saw the man seldom, and never
had anything to do with him in a bus
iness way. I always transacted my bus
iness with the directors."
Mrs. Walden is a sister of a member of
the firm of Lundberg & Lee. jewelers, at
232 Post street. Lundberg resides at 1323
Pine street, and it is conjectured by the
police that when Walden left t4e prison
he came to this city and went to the
Lundberg residence, where he later met
hi3 wife.
Captain Seymour, after a long delay,
was consulted by Prison Director Fitz
gerald and requested to do his uest to
land Walden behind the bars. But Sey
mour is badly handicapped, as It was
only in the past few days that he was
asked to make the desired arrest, and in
that short space of time Walden, who Â»rÂ»
conceded to be a clever crook, has had
ample time to get into a safe hiding
place.
The police are of the opinion, however,
that Walden is not far away, and that
if he Is being hidden by his relatives in
this city he is somewhere In the vicinity
of San Francisco and his arrest Is ex
pected at any time. ......
When Warden Aguirre came to tho
conclusion that Walden was a thief and
had stolen from the prison property val
ued at thousands of dollars, he took no
steps to arrest the man. and Mrs. Walden
was allowed to leave San Quentin. move
to San Francisco and then disappear as
mysteriously as her husband without a
watch being put on her movements for a
moment. That Mrs. Walden was In com
munication with her husband after his
disappearance is believed by everybody
conversant with the case. She evidently
at his bidding made the necessary ar
rangements for her departure, and later
joined her fugitive spouse.
Present Indications point strongly to
the conclusion that C. J. Walden, the ab
sconding clerk of the Jute mill at San
Quentin, was aided and abetted in all
his crooked transactions by confederates
Inside a? well as outside the prison walls.
It is also believed that the peculations
were going on while Walden was yet a
convict, and that he held the information"
he then acquired as a club over the heads
of certain officials, forcing them to assist
him in securing a pardon and the soft
berth he held for so many years.

The Southern Pacific Company has prac
tically decided not to enforce its new pen
sion scheme, which, was but the old in
surance scheme in disguise. About a
month ago the pension scheme was
evolved and an effort made to interest the
unorganized men in the West Oakland
yards. The insurance 3cheme having been
absolutely . repudiated by the organiza
tions, the company turned its attention to
the unorganized men. Circulars were is
sued and notices posted all through ths
yards explaining the arrangement, and
blanks were given out upon which the
men might make application for member
ship.
But the effort was unproductive of re
sult. The men did not take kindly to the
scheme and so few applications were re
ceived that the plan has been dropped.
The men feared for a time that partici
pation In the pension and* insurance
schemes would be made obligatory upon
the new employes, thus getting around
the possibility of offending the organized
railroad men. But the railroad seems to
have abandoned all intention of forcing
matters. Whether anything will be at
tempted in the future is a question, but
nothing has been done for nearly a month,
and as the men have put. the stamp of
their disapproval upon all phases of the
Insurance plan the whole project may be
dropped. . . -

Charles R. Flint of the Flint Line of
Steamers Said to Bo Interested
in the Project.'
NEW YORK, Jan. 20. â It was; reported
that a renewed attempt was being made
to bring about the consolidation of a num
ber of shipbuilding yards throughout the
country for the purpose of bringing them
under the same management and dividing
the work in such a manner that each yard
shall have a distinct class of work. Cap
ital amounting to about $60,000, <,Â»./. it is
said, will be invested in the enterprise.
While the Cramp Shipbuilding Company
of Philadelphia will be regarded as tho
principal competitor. It is expected that
negotiations will be concluded which will
result in that concern and. the, proposed
combination working in harmony.
Charles R. Flint, of Flint. Dearborn &
Co., chief owners of the American Steam
ship Company, which operates a line of
vessels between New York and San Fran
cisco and Honolulu, is said to be largely
interested in the negotiations that- are
pending. Mr. Flint said last night that he
could say nothing about the subject at
this time. Undue publicity at present.
It is thought, might injure i.ie chances of
the passage of the ship subsidy bill. It
Is understood that a firm of well known
lawyers is engaged in arranging the legiJ

with the theft of $1300 sent from the post
master at Guantanamo December 6, $1235
in cash and $65 in checks. He has con
fessed his guilt and admits having de
stroyed the check.
Sheridan was appointed from the Boston
office on the organization of the service
in Cuba. He was made postmaster at
Matanzas. . About a year ago he was
placed at the head of the money order
department at Havana with a salary of
$1000. He seemed to be a trustworthy man
and the authorities considered the expe
diency of appointing him postmaster at
the time former Postmaster Thomas was
removed.
An investment of $1800 in stocks in Bos

He now offers to refund what he has ta
ken.

CONFESSES TO THEFT
"Sending a cable is a slow matter, you
know." said he. "for the cable has to be
charged at each click of the key. Each
click exhausts the cur-ent. This has been
attributed to what electricians call the
'capacity' of the cable. To illustrate wha;
is meant by 'capacity*: Blow In a rubber
bag which has a hole at the other end.
The wind will begin to escape throujrh
lhat hole only when the bag 1 is filled. In
the same way the cable has to be charged
at the sending end to Its capacity before
the current Is felt at the receiving end.
Any hastening mixes things.
"The problem I had to solve was to re
duce the 'capacity' so that a messags
could be transmitted clearly and rapidly.
I discovered at the outset that the slow
ness of transmission was due to loss of
energy by conversion into heat and other
wise. The puzzle was to preserve thi.i
energy. By mathematical calculation I
demonstrated that this could be done by
means of a 'choke' coll placed at regular
intervals along the line. These 'choke*
coils are of wire around a core of metal.
On a cable line they should be at Interval-*
of an eighth of a mile; on land lines at In
tervals of a mile."
"I have been at work on the Invention,
for five years," said Professor Pupln In
an Interview In the New York "World. "I
conducted all the experiments in this
building and the boys here helped me.
They deserve a great deal of the credit.
The Invention not only makes an ocean
telephone possible, but it will save a for
tune In the construction of long-dlstanca
land lines. Just to give you an idea: My
.process will effect a saving of $120,000 on
each land circuit between New York and
Chicago. The saving on every 1000 miles
of land circuit will be in equal proportion
to that between Chicago and New York."
The problem which Professor Pupin has
solved Is that of maintaining electrical
energy in transmission. The Invention
is simple, merely being a plan for renew
ing the electrical waves by inserting every
eighth of a mile on the cable a coll of wire
known as the Inductance coll. Theso coils
act simply as relays, giving the electrical
waves fresh ImDetua.
Professor Pupln is professor of electrical
engineering at Columbia College and lives
at Yonkera. He Is about 35 years old, ath
letic of figure, with dark complexion,
black mustache and hair and humorous
black eyes. He is a friend of Professor
Tesla and is regarded by the latter as one
of the most promising: men In the scientific
world.
That ocean telephony can be success

A Russian melodrama, with court in
trigues, nihilists, impending Siberias.
American heroes, secret police and the
thrilling rest of it for material, will open
A. Targe and fashionable audience will
greet Mrs. Flyke to-night in "Becky
isharp" at the California Theater. The
Fiske engagement is undoubtedly one of
the most notable events of the dramatic
season, and much curiosity Is in evidence
botn as to Mrs. VUkm'm powers and as
to The worth of the new piay. Thackeray
lovers will be there to pass upon the
merits and demerits of this I^anedon
Mitchell arrangement of the favorite
"Var.lty Fair;" first-nighters of all kinds
Trill be there, together with a number of
Xolks whom curiosity as to the personality
of the one big star who is fighting the
theatrical syndicate, will attract. The
public 1? earnestly requested to be seated
by 8 o'clock, as "the play Is reasonably
long, ar.ii carriages may be ordered for 11
o'clock. 1
SINCE Walter Jones done gone and
Kot himself married last year,
nothing better In the late lament
cd*B line has been done than
Char'.es Boyle's Ch:iuncey Depot.
In "The Star Hoarder." which piece was
presumed at the Altuimbra last night. Mr.
Hoyle is also rc?iÂ»or.?lble for the new
"farce." which is pimply a collection ot
ppecialties strung on a clever title. There
if n<> jilot; there is no "hoarder" to speak
of, thoiiRli Jhere sire, "stars" a-plenty, and
but one bnarding-house jestâ the ancient
and adamantine biscuit that mother never
made â in the whole show. But there is
S r Â»"1 <1:incin^ calore, the omnipresent cake
walk in its variety, some clever coon
shouts, fun. fast and furious, from start
to finish, and s-r>mÂ«? genuine new jokes.
Hoyle has a Sousa specialty which Is
extra vnpantly funny, and with others does
an excellent parody on the "Old Ken
tucky" goaiteta with which the latter day
pastoraJs are lr.fe.sted. Bert Swor does
some coon songs in uway-up fashion, llu
has the voice, the insinuating darky
twang, and an eloquent pair of heels to
cssist. and reminds one of Billy Van In
the tricks of his trade.
Of the women in the cast. Sue Belle
3>lead as the bewildering soubrette takes
chief place. She sings. The Ksmeralda
Flsters give some "terpsichorean evolu
tions" Quite worthy the name, the exhibi
tion being remarkably clever after its
kind. There are songs by Carrie Franklin
and Lillian Grist, and choruses by the
company, which completes the catalogued
list of attractions.
Next week Murray and Mack v.ill pro
vide the entertainment.

A sensational incident occurred In this
connection at the hospital while the ln
luries were being attended to. A man
brandishing an Immense stock knife made
his appearance and wildly crying out
that he was the brother of Miss Ruggles
demanded to see her. He was asked to
relinquish the knife, but refused abso
lutely to do so. After a prolonged strug
gle the Â¦ knife was wrenched from , his
grasp and he was sent to jail pending the
result of the police Investigation.
Detectives were detailed on the- case,
but up to an early hour no clew had been
found which might lead to tho apprehen
sion of the midnight assailant. .
Cart, who lives at 1314 Mason street,
was escorting Miss Ruggles to her home
at 1215A Broadway when the stabbing oc
curred. They had reached j Pacific and
Jor.es streets, when a man whom neither
of them had noticed until that minute
came up swiftly and without a word be
gan to plunge his dagger into Cart's body,
lhe girl screamed for aid and the fellow
Hed, not. however, until he had stabbed
Ca FA so seriously that death may result.
\v hen assistance came Cart was found
to be bleeding profusely and a call for the
ambulance was sent In. At me Receiving
Hospital his â¢ wounds were treated, and
while they may prove fatal hope is enter
tained for his life.
A stabbing affray in which the identity
of the assailant is a: mystery occurred
about midnight at Pacific and Jones
streets. Miss Carrie Rugglcs and John
Cart were the victims, the former receiv
ing a slight cut in the wrist, the latter
being severely stabbed in the back and
chest with a dirk.

preceding the death of Jennie Bos
schieter will begin a week from to
morrow. - ' ' . \
Campbell from the first thought the
jury wxiuld let him off with a lighter
verdict than any of the others, and he
was much -excited on the night the ver
dict was rendered. While the people of
Paterson generally think the men fortu
nate in escaping the gallows, the pris
oners pretend to say that never did they
entertain the slightest idea of being con
victed of murder in the first degree.

Since the Verdict in the Bosschieter
CONVICTED MUEDEREB
IS BREAKING DOWN
Less than a month ago several men
boarded the West bound express at Rock
Springs, grouping at either end of the ex
press car. The guards, however, made a
prompt show of force and the" men, leap-
Ing off the train, disappeared in the dark
ness. Thes'e roughs are not mere tramps.
Several of them have been recognized by
the guards as known criminals, and the
fact that they appear jn the general vicin
ity of the big robberies at Rock. Springs
and Table Rock last summer have made
the authorities suspicious.
Three men sprang on the platform of
the East bound express No. 102 at Medi
cine Bow, but were discovered "by train
men and driven off after a short fight.
On several occasions desperate looking
men have been seen along the route, al
ways, the employes say, on the nighta
when the treasure carried was heavy.
Some of the employes of the road think
that the robbers are watching the ship
ments of valuable express matter with a
view to attacking tht trams.
CHEYENNE, W/o.. Jan. 20.-The sec
ond attempt within a month made by
train robbers to rob the express safe of
the Union Pacific occurred early Saturday

against one of Â¦ the seats. . A hammer
caught, the gun went off and Tolfers re

Baytel was a native of Warsaw, Russia.
*2 years cf age. He enlisted in Chicago
and whs aligned to Company E, Thlrty

service and was wounded, in the knee.
Such Is the strength of a shot from a
Krag-Jorgensen. tnat the bullet, after
passing through Baytci's skull passed
through the floor of the story above,
through a hair mattress three Inches
thick, through still another floor and out
through the roof.
Baytel was evidently suffering from
melancholia, a form of insanity peculiar
to those who spend any length of time
soldiering in Manila. He was to have
been discharged to-day, and had been
told so repeatedly by the lirst sergeant
of the convalescent company of which he
was a member, but the information did
not seem to afford him relief. Â»
. While his comrades were at lunch he
secured a' rifle from the arm rack. loadeuT
k and took it to his cot. Sitting on thj
edge of the bed, he bent over and plac
ing the muzzle of the gun to his left
temple, pulled the trigger. The report
brought the men running from- the din
ing room and they found him lying on the
bed with the top of hi3 head literally
blown oft. Death must have been instan
taneous. Â¦ - Â¦Â¦ .
Brooding over a shattered constitution
caused by fourteen months' service in the

THE celebration of the forty-eighth
anniversary of the founding" of
the- Young -Men's Christian Asso
,'ciation in this city was held yes
.terday.evening at. the association
building, Ellis and- Mason streets, the. ex
ercises being attended -by a large number
of members and their friends. , , . . .
of the spirit which animates the mem
bers of the association all over the world
From a small beginning the association
in this city had gone forward by strides
and to-day It stands as a monument of
which all might be proud. The speaker
reviewed. the work 'of the association anl
pointed out the many benefits which ac
crued to all who Joined the organiza
tion. Young men were benefited in many
ways. In the rooms of the association
they found spiritual guidance and also
enjoyed physical comforts and training.
There was plenty of room for the youns
men to keep on in their work and induce
others to join the association. A fea
ture of all large cities was the work
achieved by the Young Men's Christian
Association and the glorious record to
the credit â¢ of â¢ the organization in San
Francisco should increase in the future.
The exercises closed with the singing
Lands on Top of His Head
on Cement Pavement*
and Still Lives.
Edward Burke, a laboringman who re
sides at 322 Rltch street, i3 at the Receiv
ing Hospital with a badly battered head,
which may later develop into a fractured
skull. He will be removed to-day, to the
City and County Hospital, there to await
the results of his Injuries.
Burke is a teamster, and longshoreman,
and occupied a room on the third floor of
the lodging house. He claims, that late
Saturday night his room became overheat
ed and he opened the window. While he
was sitting on the window sill to cool off
he lost his balance and fell to the cement
walk below, a distance of thlrty-fÂ«ur feet.
He landed on the top of his head, and peo
ple in the neighborhood say that the re
sounding whack on the pavement . could
bo heard a block off. 'â¢â¢'*, 'Â¦'*'Â¦
Burke was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital by Policeman T. !.â¢. Murphy, and
there Doctors Starr and Boskowitz diag
nosed his case as lacerations of the scalp,
with the possibility of a fracture of the
upper portion of the skull. \
That Burke was not: instantly Killed Is
remarkable, considering the distance , he
fell and the manner in which he struck on
the cement sidewalk. Burke is about 45
years of age and weigh In the neighbor
hood of 175 pounds. Last November- he
lost his wife and things have not been
going well with him lateiy, He has a
young son living with relatives in the
country. \ -.-.-â¢ â¢,-Â¦Â¦â¢.
Burke has been brooding over his family
and financial nffairs for the last two
months, and while he claims that his fall
was accidental, his increasing melancholia
gave rise to the suspicion -. that Â¦< design
rather than accident, was the cause. â¢His
reputation in the neighborhood and among
the other roomers In the . houca is excel
lent He was not known as a. drinking
man, and no evidences of liquor were dis
cernable on him when he was brought to
the Receiving Hospital. - . r.
The extraordinary thickness of his skull
Is. in the opinion of the attending physi
cians, the only .thing that . saved him
from imme3?at<?.f^Â«ith. , -
There is good In all of them. But this
good must be refined from the dross of
ages, errors pruned, from the doctrines
tnught and Â¦ religion . rid of superstition.
No church can be ideal unless It is broad
and fair minded.
"The best religion and the best church
is the one that produces the best good
among men. The doctrines taught must
appeal to. the intelligence of strong, bold
and self-reliant men and women. In the
ideal churjeh there will be no changes as
men become more enlightened and skep
ticism passes away. I believe that the
time is fast approaching when the church,
as at present constituted, will disappear
and in -its stead there will be a mightier
church, based on the broad plan of love
for fellow man."

Fred B. Smith of Chicago, who has de
livered a number of addresses before the

The greatest Interest has been created

Seats are free.
With tears streaming down his cheeks
Frank Huntsman, a soldier attached to
CoiKpany C, Fourth Casuals, stationed at
the "presidio, accosted Policeman James
Cavanaugh on Kearny street near the
Hall of Justice early yesterday morning,
end pointing to a well dressed young
woman who stood a few feet away begged
him to give her lodging In the City Prison.
"She is my wife," tearfully remarked
the soldier, "For God's sake see that she
teis a oiace to sleep."
in answer to the officer's Questions the
roldier said that he and the woman, whose
maiden name was Alice Starratt, were
married last Wednesday. The few dol
lars he had saved went to provide for his
wife ar>.d he soon found himself penniless.
After tramping the streets for hours with
out means to hire a room for his bride,
Huntsman suggested that ehe sleep in the
City Prison. Hungry ana tired the un
fortunate woman consented, and together
They started lor the Hall of Justice. Meet-
Ing Policeman Cavanaugh, the soldier tim
idly approached him and asked him to
provide shelter for bis bride.
"Has she no relatives here?" Inquired
Cavanaugh as he cast a sympathetic
glance at the woman.
"Her parents live In Berkeley," tearfully
remarked Huntsman, "but they -have no
use for her, as she left them to marry
sue."
Touched by the pitiful appeal the big
hearted policeman at first started to reach
for his purse, but not^wanting to offend
\'Le bride and her husband he asked them
to accompany him to the police station.
To LJeutenant Martin the soldier repeated
bis strange request for lodgings for his
vife.
"I know it is a tough proposition," he re
marked as he noticed the look of disgust
on the face of the oflicsr. "but I can't
l**- :p it."
"bee that she is well taken care of."
ordered the lieutenant, addressing the
policeman. "Tell them to give her the
best b*-d in the house."
With faltering steps Mrs. Huntsman
was led to the elevator that is used for
carrying persons to the City Prison. At
the door of the casre Huntsman tenderly
kissed his bride, telling her he would call
again in the morning and endeavor to pro
vide her with better accommodations.
"Don't worry about me, George," an
swered the hapless bride, as tears coursed
cown her cheeks; "they can't separate us.
even if I am forced to ask for a bed in
the City Prison."
A moment after she entered the prison
The woman, evidently horrified by the
gloomy surroundings, emitted a scream
that could be beard on the floor below,
and fearing: she was about to collapse
Desk Sergeant Brown summoned Matron
Kabian, who escorted her to the apart
ments set aside for women. As the
â¢woman had not eaten for twenty-four
hours the kind hearted matron sent to a
neighboring restaurant for a bountiful re
past for her unfortunate lodger.
While partaking of the meal MrÂ«=.
Huntsman said she first met her soldier
husband in Chicago. She became madly
infatuated with him and despite the blt
ler opposition of her mother she consent
ed to become his wife. While she was
thinking of her impending marriage Fho
received a short but loving note from her
lover. Informing her that he had been
<alled to Denver. Determined to make him
keep his word, she packed her trunk and
followed him. She found Huntsman with
a company of "casuals" who were pre
paring to come to this city. He promised
i hat unless he was sent to Manila ho
would make her his wife as soon as they
reached this city. She arrived here last
Tuesday, and meeting Huntsman on the
following day asked h!m to ke<Â»p h's
promise. Huntsman went to the City
Hall and obtained the necessary license
and they were married that afternoon.
The newly m:irried pair visited the wo
man's mother in Berkeley, but she woull
not receive her new son-in-law. Hunts
man then installed his bride in a south of
-Market street lodging house, while he re
turned to the Presidio to join his com
pany. Saturday night, finding herself
without money to pay the rent of h-^r
room, the luckless bride went to the Pro
eidlo and poured her troubles into her
husband's ears. They came back to the
city together and finally found a tempo
rary haven for the woman in the City
Prison.
On lravlng the prison yesterday morning
Mrs. Huntsman profusely thanked the
prison keepers and the matron for their
kindness.
Mrs. V. D. FIrslow, mother of the girl,
Â¦who resides at 1707 Virginia street, Berke
ley, said last nljrht:
"My daughter has committed blcamy In

FORTY-EIGHT YEARS OF GOOD WORK
Trouble is already brewing for the new
president of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. Charles M. Hays, and the' echo
of the welcome accorded to him on his ar
rival here has. not had time to die away
ere a bomb of discord has been thrown
right at his feet.
Walter Morshead has come all the way
from England to stir up the machinery of
the law against the Southern Pacific
road. - ( ,
Mr. Morshead is one of the English hold
ers of Central, Pacific stock who was bit
terly opposed to the absorption of - the
Central Pacific by* the late C. P. Hunting
ton, and the absorption of that road by
the Southern' Pacific Company of Ken
tucky.
When the famous "funding bill" was
before Congress Morshead put up a strong
fight against the measure and was assist
ed by many English holders of Central
Pacific bonds. Morshead and His friends
were not satisfied with the defeat of the
funding bill and in June, 1899, a suit was
entered by Morshead in the United States
Circuit Court to restrain Huntlngton and
his associates from absorbing the Central
Pacific into the Southern Pacific system,
and to stop the payment of interest on the
new bonds or .mortgages which Hunting
ton proposed to issue to settle his In
debtedness to the Federal Government.
The suit promised one of the- biggest
fights in railroad history in the country
and a. decision has not yet been handed
down by the Circuit Court.
Morshead has now taken another en
tirely different step and has come all the
from. .London to San Francisco to
throw the gage of battle down to Presi
dent Hays and also to make an appeal to
the public.
Morshead is at the Grand Hotel and
yesterday he gave out for publication the
following statement, which he had served
by mall on the parties interested in the
sale of or holding of bonds of the South
ern Pacific Railroad: ',
: . . issue of
$10,000,000 bonds of the
SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMKVNY.,
To Messrs. Speyer &- Co. of New York, th<Â»
Nevada National Bank of San Francisco, and
Istaics \V. Hellman, president of that bank, and
the Central Trust Company of New York: Take
notice that as a shareholder In the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company of California I object
to the Issue or sale, as advertised, of the above
mentioned J10.000.000, or any other bonds which
are or may be secured, or deemed to be se
cured, directly or indirectly, by the assets,
stocks or bonds of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California, or the Central Pacific
Hallway Company of Uta"h. - -
And I make this objection for the following,
among other reasons, viz., because:
1. The conveyance, dated 29th of July, ISO?,
from the Central Pacific Railroad Company of
California, purporting to convey all its prop
erty and franchises to the Central Pacific Rail
way Company of Utah, for the consideration
of one dollar, was an Illegal and fraudulent
device adopted for the purpose of evading the
laws of California, by which these properties
were protected, and carrying Into effect a
scheme for confiscating the Interests of the
Central Pacific shareholders for the benefit of
"the predaceous and fraudulent, concern"
known as the Southern Pacific Company.
2. tlpward of 377,000 $100 shares in the. Cen
tral Paclflo Railroad of Calfornia have been
obtained by false and fraudulent representa
tions from the shareholders, to whom they
were sold at high prices by the late Mr. Hunt
ington and his associates, throug-h Messrs.
Speyer some years since, and in furtherance of
the 'scheme promoted by Mr. Huntlnston and
Messrs. Speyer have been, or are Intended to
be, exchanged for a like amount In par value
of. Southern Pacific stock, which is abOslutely
valueless. I
3. Two hundred thousand shares, aggregat
ing J20.000.000, In the Central Pacific Railway,
purporting to be entitled to priority both as
regards dividends and capital, have in fur
therances of the Huntington-Speyer scheme,
been Illegally Issued and have been or 'are
Intended to be delivered to the Southern Pa
cific Company In exchange for a like amount
In par value of Southern Pacific bonds, which
as . well as the stock of that company, ara
absolutely valueless.
4. Apart from the credit derived from the
assets, stock or bonds of the Central Pacific
Railroad of California. Illegally and fraudu
lently conveyed and obtained ns aforesaid (and
to which the Southern Pacific Company can
make no title), the proposed new Issue of bonds
Is absolutely unsecured, the properties of that
company being already bonded over and over
ajrain far beyond their value.
5. The control pt the Central Pacific Rail
road by a rival and comneting; company obtaln
fH'by the aforesaid Illegal and fraudulent
methods Is destructive of the Interests of the
Central Pacific shareholders, and If the'Hunt
lnitton-Speyer scheme Is consummated, past
frauds of Breat magnitude will be riveted upon
us and we shall bÂ« deprived of all chance of
past or future dividends.
. 6. Bills arc now ponding In. the Circuit Court
of California fa) impeaching these and other
frauds In connection with the attempted ab
sorption of the Central Pacific by the South
ern Pacific Company,, and (b) raising the
question whether this gigantic theft. suroasÂ§
lnK In * Its audacity the achievements of the
robber barons of the middle ages, can b>Â» suc
cessfully consummated under. American law In
the twentieth, century.
7. This notice Is Issued, and by the cour
tesy of the press. : will be published, to pre
vent as far as practicable, pending a Judicial
decision. - any of the bonds of " the - proposed
new Issue passing into- the hands of persons
who may claim to be purchasers for value
without notice of the rights which belong to
the shareholders of the : Central Pacific Rail
road of California. Â¦ \V. MORSHEAD.
