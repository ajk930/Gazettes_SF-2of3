CHINA READY TO COMPLY.
General ChalTee has been Informed of
the character of the instructions sent to
Minister Conger and directed not to par
ticipate In Von Waldersee's expedition un
der any consideration.' There Is no doubt
that there was a strong sentiment' before
the Cabinet meeting in favor* of making
direct remonstrance to' Germany, but rs
flection showed the Inadvisablllty of this
course or of seeking: to form a combina
tion with the powers against Germany.
Either course would only-have caused a
feeling of bitterness , in -Berlin. It was
thought best to. have Conger explain; the
attitude of the United States to his'col
leagues and they wlir communicate this
"statement to their. Governments.
"The United States has no troops in
China except those which comprise the
legation guard. The United States is not
at war with China. Having rescued the
American citizens besieged In Peking and
taken possession of the* city until J dus
reparation is made, there appears to, thla

forth the demands, of foreign .Govern

China has been carrying out the terms as
energetically as she can. It' does not ap
pear, therefore, that there is ground for
any further military action at this time."
It was -finally decided : to have Acting
Secretary "Hill Instruct Conger in this
sense:
Two hours and a half were spent by the
Cabinet in considering Count von Walder

opened before us and he has spent many
hours, days and weeks of anxious thought
and study in- endeavoring to perfect his

I asked M. de Santos Dumont what were
the possiblltles of a cteerable /balloon in
the near future.
"For the present," he replied, "and for a
few years to come, I think It will be only
used for sport and for pastime. In case of
war It could be used with advantage in
bombarding the chief towns, In carrying
dispatches and principally to follow the
movements of the enemy.
"For commercial means and for transpor

are that the time will come when navi

"Do you think they can be so construct
ed that in case of any accident to the
balloon the safety of human life can be
assured?" waa asked. He replied:
"To avoid danger we can divide the bal
loon Into different cells or compartments
and so If one bursts we have a reserve In
another to keep the machine in the air.
As for landing In a storm or a strong
wind, they will be easy to control, being
pointed at both ends so as to give less

STEEBABLE BALLOONS
WILL SOON BE USED
THE business community of this,
city was agitated yesterday by an
incident which has had few par
allels in commercial and legal
circles In San Francisco. A
clever scheme, deliberately planned and
It was supposed executed In the utmost
secrecy, was made to Interfere with the
processes of the Superior Court and rob
it of evidence which. In a bitterly con
tested case now in progress, would have
been of the most sensational nature.
Agents of prominent business men, who
have been made defendants In an action
In which they are accused of organizing
a corporation that the laws of the United
States have made illegal, took the first
steps yesterday to destroy the documen
tary evidence which would have been
harmful to them.
The facts of this deliberate plot to in
terfere with the authority of the Superior
Court became public property yesterday
afternoon and wer^ the theme of general
discussion in the downtown districts. The
suit out of which this sensational develop
ment has been evolved has been instituted
by R. P. f Merilllon against Thomas E.
Ryan, J. W. Bartholomew and Henry
Euler, who constitute the majority of the
board of directors of the American Box
Factory- Merilllon Is a stockholder and
director of this corporation and In his
suit he accuses the defendants of having
entered Into an unlawful combination to
destroy commercial competition and main
tain exorbitant prices in one of the most
important avenues of trade on the Pacific
Coast.
Plot of a Mammoth Trust.
This is not the first time that MerilHon
has accused his associates of wrongdoing,
but his latest charges are far more se
rious than any others preferred by him.
His suit Is now In progress before Su
perior Judge Murasky. About two years
ago there was organized in this city a
corporation known as the Spruce Pack
age Company. This combination, which
was designed ambitiously to control the
entire box trade of the Pacific Coast, was
made by the American Box Factor}', the
Grays Harbor Commercial Company, the
Clatsop Mill Company and Hobbs, "Wall &
Co.
The purpose of this commercial combi
nation was' to control the trade In boxes
and to shut out of the' market all firms
which were not In the pool. In order to
do'this It became necessary to secure ab
solute" direction of the Oregon output of
spruce shooks, the trade designation for
the lumber out of which boxes are made.
Until the organization of the Spruce Pack
age Company the local. State and coast
competition in boxes had become very
keen and It was determined to make the
pool uncompromising in its treatment of
its competitors.
Several of the representatives of the
combine went therefore to Portland and
negotiated with mills for their exclusive
production In the California trade. In
making this demand the members of the
local trust calculated that they would
shut out all coast competitors in the box
manufacturing industry by keeping from
The proof of this accusation Is claimed
to be In .the. contracts which the Spruce
Package Company- mad*Â»wlth-tnÂ«- Port
land mills. "When Merlllion made his
threat the responsible representatives of
the firms associated in the Spruce Pack
age Company became so agitated that
they could not keep their own counsel and
the business community was enjoying
their distress as a matter of sensational
gossip. Telegrams were sent post haste,
conferences .were held and orders were
Issued that the contracts with the Port
land mills be got out of the way In the
shortest possible time. Demands were
made that not only the originals, but
every copy be secured and now the gos
sips In the commercial district who have
been told the secret are wondering what
will happen when Merilllon demands the
documentary evidence which his opponents
have been/In such eager haste to destroy.
When this had been done Merilllon insti
tuted his suit to 'prevent the American
Box Factory from continuing as a mem
ber of the Spruce Package Company. He
alleged that the latter corporation is an
unlawful combination and has violated
the statutes of the nation. These accu
sations created considerable excitement In
the business community of this city and
when the trial began on Monday marked
Interest in the matter was displayed, par
ticularly when the attorney for Merlllion
offered to prove his allegations that under
the laws of the United States the Spruce
Package Company Is an unlawful com
bination.
Orders Issued to Destroy, the Proofs.
After the local trust had been organized
and the contracts with the Portland mills
had been made, .Merilllon quarreled with
his fellow directors' in the American Box
Factory and determined that he would
force that corporation out of the Spruce
Package Company. He accused his asso
ciates In the directory of having defraud
ed the United States Government by mak
ing grossly excessive charge for boxes.
A sensational investigation followed and
the money which had been paid by the
Government in . overcharge was returned.
Â¦The , representatives who were sent by
the pool to negotiate with the Portland
lumbermen performed their duty well.
They signed contracts with the three
prominent and only important mills of
Portland to purchase a certain amount of
lumber from them during the years 1899
and 1500 on condition that these northern
mills would not sell to any other Califor
nia firm or combination during that time
any box lumber. The corporations with
whom this compact was pade were the
Standard Box Company of- Portland, the
Multnomah Box and- Truck Company, and
the Multnomah Box Company.
Making of the Telltale Contracts.
them all of the box lumber on the coast.
This scheme camo perilously near being
a direct and most serious violation of the
Interstate commerce law, and yesterday
the entire commercial community was dis
cussing the desperate means which have
been taken to destroy the documentary
evidence of the fact.

a certain lukewarmness on the part of
some of the opposition, eucceeded in ap

on a level of unworthiness with the tac

start to force these bills to final passage.
Assembly bill 558 was under considera

Johnson suavely explained that since he
understood that Mr. Melick and othors
would withdraw their opposition If the
amendment prevailed he was in favor of
Its adoption. He therefore moved the pre

amendment was promptly adopted and
Johnson at once asserted that under, the
previous question further amendment was
not possible. Brown of San Ma teo claimed
that such was not the effect of the previ

The fire originated in Stanley A. ,Mc-
Intosh's general store and swept through
the range of buildings, .razing Helbner's
barber shop,- J: E. Martinz's saloon, the
Â»Harrison Gulch Hotel,} C. M. Green's

the Midas Gold Mining Company, Thur

pledge Brown to support the bill if the
amendment were adopted, but Brown said
he was not pledging himself to support
any bill. â¢ The Speaker again showed his
attitude toward opponents of the bills by
saying:
"The gentleman declines to answer Mr.
Johnson's cuestlon."
Johnson resorted to the previous ques
tion again, and debate was again choked
off. Brown's amendment was adopted
and the two bills, on motion of Johnson,
retain trfeir place as special orders. They
will come up for final passage to-morrow

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 18.â Senator Louis Oneal
ought to tell his constituents In Santa
Clara why he desires to amend that com
prehensive section of the Political Code
numbered 1000. Should he find any difficul
ty In making the explanation lucid he
might invoke the assistance of Johnny
Mackenzie, who was never known to put
a political friend on a blind trail. The
section as It now stands in the law book
reads:
Sec. 10COâ Vacancies occurring- In office durine
the recess of the Legislature, the appointment
to which is vested in the Governor and Senate,
or in the Legislature, muat be filled -by ap
pointment made by the Governor; but the per
son so appointed can. only bold the office until
the adjournment of the next session of the
Legislature.
Obviously the wording does not suit the
fancy of Senator Oneal, hence he intro
duces Senate bill Xo. 479, as follows:
An act to amend section 1000 of the Political
Code, relative to the appointive- power fo the
Governor. The People of the State of Califor
nia, represented in Senate and Assembly, do
enact aa follows:
Section 1. Section 1000 of the Political Cod*
is hereby amended to read as follows:
Sec. 1000. Whenever an office, the appoint
ment to which is vested in the Governor and
Senate, or in the Legislature, either becomes
vacant or the term of the incumbent of which
expires, during the recess of the Legislature,
the Governor has power to appoint a person
to such of flee; but the person so appointed can
only hold the office until the adjournment of
the next session of the Legislature.
Sec. 2. Thts act takes effect immediately.
The reader will observe that the amend
ment contains the added words "or the
term of the incumbent of which expires."
It Is the settled law in the State, accord
ing to the decisions of the Supreme Court,
that a vacancy in office Is not caused by
the expiration of the term, therefore if
Senator Oneal's amendment prevails the
Governor, after the adjournment of the
present Legislature, will be empowered to
appoint, but the appointee can only hold
the office until the adjournment of the
next Legislature.
Take for example P. J. Harney's four
years', term as Harbor Commissioner. He
was appointed March 20. 1897,and bis term
will expire March 20, 1901. The law as it
now stands permits the Governor to sub
mit to the Senate the name of Major Har
ney's successor, and should confirmation
wait on the nomination the new Com
missioner womd be In for four years.
According to the Oneal- amendment the
Governor will not be called upon to ap
point until the Legislature has adjourned,
and then the new Commissioner will hold
only until the adjournment of the next
Legislature.
Andrew J. Clunle's term as Insurance
Commissioner will expire in April. 1902.
Should the Oneal amendment prevail the
Governor at that time would be able to
appoint a. successor to Mr. - Clunlo who
would hold office until the next session of
the Legislature. Â¦ . .
The amendment enacted Into law would
have the general effect of abolishing the
fixed term of office, as contemplated by
the constitution, and fixing the tenure at
the> Governor's pleasure. This may not
involve danger to the public service at the
present time, but It in the future the peo
ple should happen to elect a bad Gov
ernor, or one consumed h.v an ambition to
succeed himself in the office of chief exec
utive, there would be evil results.
Â¦The bad Governor might say to the Har
bor Commissioner: "You do not hold of
fice for four years. If your conduct is not
to my liking and if your friends fail to
support me I will not send your name to
the Senate for confirmation."
The law as it now stands is all right.
If Senator Oneal and John Mackenzie will
pause and reflect they will consider that
the people of Santa Clara County have
enjoyed prosperities Innumerable and po
litical blessings galore under the existing
statute. The proposed Oneal amendment
will not enhance the price of prunes or
promote the glory of the Normal Schoot.
Santa Clara County is not clamoring for
the amendment to section 1000 of the Po
litical Code.
The source of Senator Oneal's Inspira
tion cannot be traced to Santa Clara
County. It springs from another quar
ter, and the Senate Judiciary Committee
may make a diligent inquiry to ascertain
the true source. The Governor's assist
ance should be invoked by tho Senators.

of that harbor In relation to the bill in

Duties of San Francisco's

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 10.â Tim report of the As
sembly committee which went to San,
Francisco to look into tho affairs of the
Police Department therj will be submitt
ed on Thursday morning, or perhaps to
morrow night. It was expected that it
would be held off until al-er the officers
summoned to appear Thursday noon bad
been heard and dealt with, tut It Is now
admitted that the report will i>e in Thurs
day morning anyway.
Just what form the report will take Is a
matter of some speculation, bat there
really has been but little interest la it. It
is probable that the committee w'.ll sub
mit to the Assembly the fact that a Stata
law has been violated and that it st^ould
not lightly be passed over. It may be
tooy that the attention of the Governor
will be called to the matter, and it is al
most certain that it will bÂ« suggested to
the District Attorney of San fc'rancisco
that he might find it within his duties to
take up the la.ir violations, to the end that
offenders might not go wholly un
punished.
But when it attempts to proceed fur
ther than to report its findings, the com
mittee finds itself on ground cut up by in
numerable legal chuckholes and ditches.
It has for some time been admitted that
over the Police Department of San Fran
cisco the Legislature has no corrective
power. Any member may bring proceed
ings and so could any other citizen of tha
State and city. Tne testimony taken be
fore the committee will give material for
any one to commence a suit upon, but so
far as the Assembly is concerned It la
conceded that It cannot discipline thÂ© Sain,
Francisco Police Department unless it
can show a direct contempt of its legisla
tive dignity and' a defiance of its power.
"While the committee may show wrong
doing, it can show no detlance or con
tempt for the Legislature on the part of
the Police Department, except the Inci
dent of the subpoena.
For this reason the members of the com
mittee are spending plenty of time over
their report. Beyond calling the attention
of the Assembly, the Governor and the
District Attorney to the state of affairs
it found, the committee can make some
general recommendations toward guard
ing against a relapse Into evil ways on
the part of the Police- Department, but
what It can recommend for the punish
ment of past misdeeds is what Is Â¦worry-
Ing the committee now.

VANCOUVER. B. C, Feb. 19.â The crest
of a mountain whose top i3 more than a
mile in circumference slid into Lough
borough Inlet, 100 miles north from Van
couver, last Saturday just before noon.
The great slide was caused by an earth
quake, which shook the surrounding dis
trict for several eeconds, and the result
ing shock of the falling mountain top
could be felt a long distance.
Along this part of the coast the
mountains rise ', almost perpendicularly
out of the water for 700 or 800 feet. The
mountain which 'fell was composed of a
great crag which overhung the shore, and
an enormous slice of It sheered off Into
the bay. The break extended back 400
feet from the shore. Giant trees and im
mense boulders were carried away by the
slide. Instead of crumbling as it fell the
huge mass of â¢ rock remained solid and
flung itself far out into the bay. A heavy
sea was caused which would have swal
lowed up a good-sized steamer, and a tidal
wave swept away down the inlet. Several
small boats three miles away were thrown
up into the woods, and two booms of logs
ready to be sent to market in Vancouver
were thrown out of the water and prac
tically wrecked.
News of the earthquake was brought to

MENTO. Feb. IS.â Another plan of Con
gressional apportionment will be sprung
when the subject comes up for discussion,
this time from the representatives of the
proposed Sixth District, which is mainly
what is now the Seventh. It will make
but a few changes in the plan proposed by
the committee, but the effect. It Is
claimed, will be. to secure to the new dis
trict what it is feared it lacks nowâ a Re
publican majority. It is claimed further
that the population in each of tho dis
tricts, as will be proposed, will be much
more oven and much closer to the allot
ment of 1S0.O00 which has been decided to
be proper for Congressional districts.
The new plan proposes to take Mendo
c!no from the proposed First District and
add in its place Tuolumne and Mariposa.
This would reduce the population from
3W.831 to 195 r 312 and reduce the comfortable
majority of the last election of 3Â£3 to
2K7. This would relieve the proposed
Sixth District of two very Democratic
counties. Mendocino would be put into
the Second District, increasing it from
3O.3S3 to 3>s3.Ck and increasing the major
ity from Â£7u5 to 2^71.
Tulan- also would be taken from the
proposed Sixth District, which, with the
loss of Tuolumne and Mariposa. would
reduce the population from 2l<7.153 to 172,
Â£?2 and would raise the Republican major
ity from the very doubtful figure of 546 to
the more certain one of 1302. Tulare would
be added to the proposed Seventh Dis
trict, raising the population from 167.029
to 1S5.{'>; and reducing the Republican ma
jority from 4555 to 4*03. These majorities
sre all figured on the last vcte for Con-
The plan was figured out bv E F
Mitchell, secretary of the present" Seventh
District Congressional delegation. It
probably will be introduced by Rowell as
an amendment to the bill. The plan is
rinding much favor, for the bunching of
roveral Democratic counties made the
proposed Sixth District very doubtfully
Republican. It could well spare the pop-
Uiation. and t=n in Mitchell's plan some of
tho more Democratic counties have been
parceled off where their adverse major
ities would do no harm to the dominant

MEXTO, Feb. 19.â The committee substi
tute for Senate bill 13S, which is the meas
ure revising the Code of Civil Proced
ure, passed second reading in the Senate
to-day. ' There were some amendments
submitted, but most of these were without
avail.
The first was an attempt to have
stricken from the bill a. provision
which declares that a person to whom a
cause of action has been assigned merely
for collection is not. a party in interest,
and therefore the ' assignee cannot sue.
The attempt to -amend was voted down.
The effect of the section is to throw a
stumbling-block in the way of collection
agents. Â¦ .-â¢â¢ Â¦ . .
An amendment to strike out a clause in
section 1365, which would allow the ap
pointment of "some competent person"
selected by the relatives' .of Â¦ a deceased
person, to administer upon an estate, was
adopted.. This removes a;.clause which
aroused great opposition from Public Ad

An amendment to strike from the
amended bill a clause exempting from
privileged communications any communi
cation made to an attorney with the in
tention of having It communicated to
some party having an interest adverse to
the client, or when the same is made in
the furtherance of fraud or crime, was.
los{.
The consideration of these amendments
consumed the morning. session, Davis and
Curtln doing most of the talking. The bill
will come up for third reading probably
this week.
The first nights session of the Assembly
was devoted to the code revision bills.
After a spirited contest bill 6S3, the Civil
Code bill, was made a special order for
Thursday night, and several amendments
to bill C26. relating to the Code of ClvH..Pro
cedure. were adopted.
Treadwell moved at the beginning of the
session that 6S3 be taken up instead of 626.
Johnson, who had come primed with
amendments to G3S, objected strenuously
and tried to g<t 683 referred to the Judi
ciary Committee. Treadwell said the bills
were the fruition of four years of work
by the Code Commissioners and reference
nctv to the Judiciary Committee would
n.can tho delay and probable defeat of
them. Finally Johnson consented to post
ponement till Thursday, instead of refer
ence.
Fisk moved that bill 626 be considered
as a whole, precluding amendment. Sher
idan said such action would not be con
stitutional, and Fisk withdrew his motion.
Johnson offered an ajnendment provid
ing: for appeal in contempt cases. Though
members from the mining districts, hav
ing In view injunction suits, opposed the
amendment, it was adopted.
An amendment offered by Melick. that
in foreclosures on land a duplicate notice
must be served on the defendant if he be
within the county, was defeated.
Sheridan offered an amendment striking
out the section of the bill which legalizes
fees for. expert witnesses. It proved a
popular amendment and was adopted.
Johnson had an amendment to offer,
making it necessary to have the applica
tion tor the disqualification of a-.TucIge
to hear a cai=e made before the action be
commenced. It was adopted.
Fisk again came forward In behalf of
the Governor's idea that the bill should
be crowded through to final passage and
amendments left to be adopted bv sub-
Sequent Legislatures. This time he "moved
that the bill be ordered to engrossment
and third reading. Â¦ The motion provoked
a spirited contest, in the midst of which
Feliz called attention to the fact that the
time for adjournment had arrived, and
adjournment was consequently taken.

a. cup of eoffeo."
This remark If heard not only in hotels
restaurants and lunch rooms but it is the
usual breakfast order in the home drcl<!
as well. After a twelve hours' fast It
mould s<?fm that tne first mr-;U of the
day should be a hearty, substantial one!
and if we all lived natural, unartiflciat
live*, it would be so. but none of us do
r.ene* breakfast is a mere pretense
Says a latter-day philosopher: "Durine
many years of active business life I never
remember having <?aten a good, substan-
tial breakfast, but supposed It was of no
importance until I beÂ»ran to lose appetite
for lunch and dinnsr. " "
"My physician told me I was a victim of
r.ervous dyspepsia and must take rest and
recreation, as no medicine would reach
the trouble, but this advice I could not
follow, es my business affairs would not
permit It. and to rat relief I resorted to
medicines and prescriptions, and it was
purely accidental that I hit upon one rem-
edy which did the business. While In a
drugstore one evening I noticed a number
of people buyinp Stuart's Dyppepnla Tab-
Jets, a widely advertised preparation for
stomach troubles, and the force of ex-
ample was too much for me and I bought
a fifty-cent package.
ri took a tablet or two after each meal
and in a week my appetite picked up f
Â¦began to feel- my old ambition for : work
returning: and could cat a pood breakfast
because I wanted :jt. and from that time
toT this I' take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
as regularly as I take 'my meals, not be-
cause I now have any trouble with rny
ptonaach. but because I don't want to
â¢have.
. "A fifty-cent box of Stuart's Ta.blets
.will last me a month and keep my diges-
tion In Kood order, and I know of no bet-
ter Investment a business man can make."

to 11. The victor, used his powerful left
to advantage. Forbes-was unable to con
nect with the ball.
.Levy" (scratch) defeated Coffroth
(scratch) by a score of 51 to 43. The con
test was the closest of the tournament
and the spectators continually cheered the
piayerp. Both men played hard and the
victory was a well earned one. Bartlett

SLOPPY and slushy was tho Tan
foran track yesterday. The
rain drove over the field with
out a let-up from the first
to tho last race. Outside of
the betting ring there was noth
ing but bleak winter. A heavy wind
blew down the stretch and whistled
through the grandstand, playing a sad ac
companiment to the losers, for the favor
ites were again hurled from the pedestal.
15r. H. E. Rowell's Alee won the first
race, seven furlongs, without much ef
fort. Torsida was the favorite and that
was all she was. Alee got off In the
start and Woods, who had the leg, kept
all the other sellers some distance behind,
even to the wire, which was passed
by Alee first by a length, McNamara sec
ond-and Billy Moore third. Alee sold at
7 to 1. All that was needed was a good
ride, something that Buchanan did not
give the last time . AleÂ© was In .the run
ning.
Isallne, Buchanan up, took first money
in simple fashion in the second race. Sec
ond choice at 9 to 5, Isallne kept the lead
right through the six furlongs of slush
and finished four lengths ahead of Sweet
Caporal, the favorite, with Tommy
Burns up.
J O C. 15 to 1, won out handily in the
third race, which should have been a six
hurdle affair, but owing to the condition
of the track, was run on the flat Vera
gua and Koenig were the first and second
choices, but they decorated the end of the
tleld. Rio Chico, heavily played, led into
the stretch and would have won if Mc-
Kenna knew anything about the riding
game: Rio was passed by J O C at the
wire, a neck being the separating dis
tance.
Janice with Winnie O'Conner in the sad
dle won the four-cornered seven furlones
without raising a. hair. Telamon, a
4-5 favorite, came within the money dis
tancing Moonbright for the show, which
meant nothing in the betting. Janice took
the lead, held to it and at no time felt the
fear of a pass. Janice sold at 2-1 and had
quite a backing among the knowing ones
The fifth race, one mile and seventy
yards, selling, was captured by Lavator
Prestcmc with Enos up set the pace and
kept In the lead until the stretch -was
hoofed. ' Then the race lay between Im
perious and Lavator, both of whom fin
ished strongly and took the money right
out of Prcstome's hands. See on Lavator
won by a length. Josephine B was ths
favorite, but the beat she could do was a
bad . fourth. There were fdur horses In
the race, Artilla . being scratched.
The sixth race was over a six and a half
furlong route for a field of eleven selllnjr
platers. The Gafflr delayed the start by
running away with Buchanan for a two
mile sprint. Then the race went on. Cer
ro Santa got away at the start and kept
the lead until the stretch, but Uzzel.a
passed under -the wire first without any
hard work on the part of Woods, who did
the piloting. Llzzclla was 5-L

SUMMONS NOT SERVED
ON DUKE OF WESTMINSTEB
Story That He Is Connected With
Major Atherton's Divorca Suit
Without Foundation.
LONDON, Feb. 19.â A representative of
the Associated Press has investigated the
story printed In a New York newspaper
to the effect that a summons was served
on the Duke of Westminster on the occa
sion of his marriage to Miss Shelagh
West Saturday last in a suit for divorce
brought by Major Atherton, with whose
wife the Duke is said to have been a pas
senger on his return from South Africa.
The report has no foundation in fact.
No divorce suit had been filed up to noon
yesterday and a summons could not be Is
sued before the" filing of the suit. Mrs.
Atherton is in Rome and Major Atherton
is still in South Africa.

Track Notes.
Charley Macklin is in the saddle again
at Oakland. J
Mounce and Bullman. two of Oakland's
best riders, are on the sick lfct.
Frank Hayes, who found the game too
full of- curves at Tanforan, is meeting
with better success at the track acros j
the bay. Hayes is one of the biggest bet
tors around the New York tracks.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman beat the
books at Oakland yesterday. Johnny ia
not going to book, though, preferring a
trip to the country until things in general
pertaining to the turf have become mote
settled. .. ." Â¦,, . .
Buchanan's Baddle work has been the
subject of much unpleasant criticism of
late. The sudden improvement in form
shown by Alee is hard to explain.
Tommy Burns still finds -it difficult to
land a favorite in front. In this respect
he plays In harder luck than almost any
other rider in the business.
Charley Thorpe. -beyond question the
most popular rider that ever wore silk on
a California track.' will be seen In tht
saddle at Oakland. Â¦
CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
By F. E. Mulholland.
A TURN about is fair, pray, and de
spised ones in the betting hadall
sorts of fun with the favorftes
yesterday at Oakland track.
Everybody It would seem backed
Pat Morrissey to win the mile and seventy
yards run, and old Uarda came breezing
in at the luscious p'rice of 12 to 1. Scally
wag, Boundlee, El Toplo and Follow Me
were the others to cause a stampede in
the camp of the favorite players. The
races were decided in the face of a driv
ing rainstorm, and as the -card was one
not bristling with attractive features the
attendance was only fair.
Follow Me, a C to 1 chance, with Ransch
on his back, gave the other eight starters
in the introductory sprint a merry chase.
Breaking away from the pest stxtji. the
gelding skimmed away in the lead, beat
ing his way home a quarter of a dozen
lengths in front of Spindle, with Billy
Lyons, the favorite, third. Soils astride
Spindle pumped and ran Into two or three
horses, for which the judges disqualified
him, a decision that gave entire satisfac
tion.
The stable of Doble & Co* took tho two
year-old dash with Louwelsea, a neatly
turned filly by Rey El Santa Anita. Dom
inlck had the mount, and, backed down
to 3 to 2 favoritism, she won hands down
from Prestene and Monastic. Kansch is
not a capital hand at piloting members of
the kindergarten class, and Vassalo,
which opened favorite, receded and ran
unplaced. The -.-tart In this event was one
of the prettiest of the season.
Doble & Co. followed this win up by an
nexing the six-furlong spin that followed
with El Toplo. handled by Ruiz and 5 to
2 in the betting.- The colt Jumped away
in front and. never extended, downed the
10 to 1 shot KIdred almost eased up.
Merida, the 6 to 5 favorite, lost the show
to El Kara.
Popular as ever. Pat Morrissey was next
set up a 1 to 2 chance for the mile and
seventy yards run. He plowed through
the slush and slop in rollicking fashion
for over two-thtrds of the journey and
thea began to tire. First Uarda passed
mm. then Xorford, the former getting'the
decision by four open lengths.
Stuart landed the llfth race with Scally
wag, the' second choice. The gelding dis
played better staying qualities than usual,
and after making all the runnihg, won at
the wire by two lengths from Duckoy, the
favorite. Joe Rlpley ran third under little
Brodlen's piloting. . *,
Judging from her poor showing in the
last event at six furlongs, Torsina should
be placed on the dry dock for a thorough
overhauling. A 9 to 5 Â¦ favorite, she fin
ished last with "Pug" Devln up. Domin-
Ick had Boundlee In front soon after the
start, reaching town five lengths before
Tiburon. Show honors went to Jerid.
Following are the entries and weights
for two rich events 'to be decided at Oak
land this week:

WASHINGTON. Feb. 19.-The Secretary
of War to-day replied to the Senate reso
lution of February 5 asking: for the facts
in the case of George T. Rice, editor of
the Daily Bulletin of Manila, who was
recently deported to the United States by
order of General MacArthur. The Secre
tary's letter consists simply of copies of
two telegrams which passed between Ad
jutant General Corbin and General Mac-
Arthur on the subject. On tne 7th Inst.
General "Corbin cabled General MacArthur
a.Â° follows:
"To reply to resolution of the Senate,
the Secretary of War desire's you to cable
whether one Rice has been deported, by
what authority and for what offense."
General MacArthur replied on the 8th
Inst. as follows:
"Editor deported to San Francisco Jan
uary 28. Offense malicious publication of
false charges affecting the integrltv of the
administration of the office of captain of
the port. In which he was formerly em
ployed, this with full knowledge of their
falsity. The matter received exhaustive
Investigation, in which Rice was heard in
his own defense. He was informed he
must give bond not to republlsh or must
leave the islands, as his actions were
creating strife and were a menace to the
military situation. He maintained an at
titude of defiance and was necessarily
sent home. Full report was forwarded,
with all papers, February 1.'?
The Secretary of War said that this cor
respondence was the only information he
had on the subject of the resolution,- and
he added that the mail report referred to
by- General MacArthur would be subse
quently transmitted to the Senate.

â¢ D. W. SMITH. 1S21 Center St.The strain? Â«f a "ragtime" march her
alded the approach of the procession, and
the pight which followed was well worth
puing; many miles to see. First came the
orchestra, cla<l In yellow dominos. march
ing In Ftatoly step and followed by the
herald, jester and counselor, who preceded
the Prince and his? Queen, attended by
two pag-oÂ«=. In brave array followed the
gorgeous retinue and the dancers. Slowly
and befitting the occasion, the procession
wended its way through the main hall
via an anteroom into the Mary Searles
gallery. At each end of the gallery boxes
had been erected, and on one side of the
larjre room was the throne for the Prince
and his Queen.
Khtering the gallery, the procession
made the circuit of the room, and the
Prince bravely led his Queen to her
throne. The dancers grouped themselves
around the room, leaving the center of the
floor clear. At a signal from the Prince
trumpets sounded and the herald thrice
proclaimed Filcr.ce. Then to the strains
of the orchestra the herald in musical
tones told of the approach of the carnival
peason and the rule of the Prince. That
potentate also told of his power In the
language of song and commanded all
present to throw dull care away and enjoy
the fleeting hours.
"Raising his scepter, the Prince pro
claimed loudly "On with the dance," and
the monotone of the brass orchestra gave
way to the dreamy strains of a Strauss
waltz. Colored electric lights flashed
from the corners cf the gallery on the
group of dancers and the gayly clad mass
broke from its Ferried ranks Into whirling
couples. The scene at that instant was
a striking one. It looked as if a rainbow
had been broken into particles and flung
all over the floor of the gallery. The
ebimmering silks and patlns of the worn
en, the sparkle of gems, velvety hair and
rnowy arms and necks, Etood In bold re
lief from the background formed by the
dress suits of the majority of the men.

GAY PROCESSION
POURS INTO VIEW
As the trumpets echoed through the
Institute the dancers, guided by the re
ception committee, assembled In the an
nex to the main hall.
Previous to the grand march the ladles
and their escorts spent the time In prome
nading and in conversation. The majorlty
of the ladies were In costume and masked,
but very few of the sterner Eex appeared
in costume. The conventional black dress
fruit was In evidence In all parts of the
hulid!ng and served to heighten the color
tfTects of the fancy dresses of the fair
eex.
The main hall was decorated with Chi
nese and Japanese lanterns and festooned
with streamers of evergreen and eatln
ribbons. The Mary Searles gallery was a
veritable bower of fairyland, and It was
In this apartment that the Prince opened
his court.

Goroeouslu Arraued Monarchs
.Common Throng,
The gorgeously arrayed prince and
queen danced with the humblest of their
subjects, and for hours the joyous gath
ering "danced the fleeting hours away." *
Refreshments were served during the
evening, and_ at midnight the supper
rooms were thrown open. It was not until
an early hour this morning that the laVt
of the dancers departed. At midnight all
masks were discarded, and ,roany of the
ladies who had worn dominoes put them
aside and appeared In exquisite creations
of the milliner's art.
From start to finish the Mardl Gras bal
masque was a complete success, and In
the opinion of those who participated it
was by far the most enjoyable of any
ever given by the Art Association.

at a thousand points and reflected In
eparkMng flashes. "On with the dance,
let Joy be unconftncd," was the motto of
all present, and a merrier throng never
gathered together in this city of the Gold
en Gate.
While there was not a remarkable va
riety of fancy dress, the quantity was
more than compensated for by the quality.
In one corner of the gallery an eye wit
ness could see a group of "colored girls"
enacted by well-known society ladles.
Here was. "La Tosca" to the life, with
broad-brimmed hat. long walking staff
atid huge bunch of flowers, dancing with
a prominent politician who wore the
"pink" hunting coat prescribed for Eng
lish huntsmen. â¢
The meny jester cut his capers among
the crowd of dancers and his faithful dog
â¢was a source o? amusement. The jefcter
declined to disclose the identity of the
dog, but told inquirers that it belonged to.
Miss Tui and that the animal's name for
the evening was "Laddie."
Gliding gracerully over the floor was a
you.ig laOy dressed as a poppy. Kot a
particle of her costume but was a brilliant
red. Poppies v. tre fastened over the red
material, and her rich auburn hair was
crowned by a hrt made of the pretty flow
ers. Another charming effect Was a dress
of violets. Thousands of the fragrant
buds were draped over a dress of violet
hue. A ragged looking tramp, was the
vis-a-vis of a stately looking lady, who
was dressed as a court. darno of the fif
teenth century. China' and France were
on good terms, for a demure little Nor
mandy maid clung to a stalwart Chinese
as he piloted her through the crowd of
dancers. Columbine was also there, and
Pierrot was not far away. Army and navy
officers danced with "coon girls," and

Deputies J. H. Downs and Hugh Walters.
They were taken to Ukiah, tried, convict

CaicX TcinT>lar, Su^. I^odgc Good Templars. , - CAldcnnan 2^tli WardJOUR FRUIT IN GREAT BRITAIN.
I
rROM a report just received by the State De
partment from Consul Boyle of Liverpool it ap- â¢
pears some of the leading papers in Great Brit
ain are discussing with considerable earnestness * the
growth of the sale of California fruit products in the
British market. Thus the London Telegraph is
quoted as having recently stated: "Many interesting
facts are to be gleaned as to the growing part that
fruit pulps from abroad are playing in the manufacture
I of English jams. When a single order from one noted
London firm alone amounts to twenty-eight tons of
apricot pulp from California, it will convey some idea
of the magnitude the system is attaining. Plums,
pineapples, quinces, apples and peaches are also
largely utilized in this way, and the latest triumph, as
it is claimed, in this direction is that of being able to
send into this country strawberry pulp. Small won
der, indeed, that the British grower has cause for
complaint 'that the demand is not what it was' for hh
products."
Shipment of fruit puhp in such quantities from
California to the British market is to a certain extent
gratifying. It is a proof that a rich market is within
reach and promises to afford us an ample consuming
power for the output of our orchards. With proper
transportation facilities, and they may be expected in
the near future, there ir no reason why we should not
furnish from California orchards the great bulk of
the finer fruits needed by the British people.
There is, however, another side to the trade that is
by no means so satisfactory. We are sending* fruit
pulp to Great Britain to be made into jellies and jami
and conserves of.various kinds. When they have been
thus manufactured into the highest forms known to
the market the British manufacturer sells them in all
parts of the world. A considerable bulk of British
fruit preserves is, in fact, sold right here in San
Francisco, and doubtless some of those preserves are
made from fruits that were grown in Californian valr
leys! Thus we send the raw material to London and
bring back the finished article. Why should -we not
manufacture the fruit at home?
For many years past the profits of fruit-growing in
California have been so large that it has engaged al
most all the capital available for use in the fruit in
dustry. - The work of preparing the fruit for market
has been confined mainly to drying it or putting it up
in cans. ,It is true that there arc several manufac
turers of fine grades of. fruit preserves, but their oper
ations are on comparatively a small scale. What they
have succeeded in doing has been but a beginning in
the great work of the kind that ought to be done.
At the present time there are signs that the profir
able growing of fruit has about reached the limit oi
consumption in the form in which Californians hav<
been in the habit of selling it. The prune-growers
for example, can hardly sell the crop of last season
Such bein~ the case, the time has come when a pot

Tendencies of State Federation.
There are several other causes which
explain the rapid growth and great effi
ciency of these organizations. When the
women's cluba were flrst organized they
were not democratic in principle, though
they rapidly becamo so In practice. Tho
clubs at flrst represented a most difficult
clas3 of women to organize, being com
posed of well-to-do â even wealthyâmem
bers with intellectual tastes and conser
vative tendencies; members. were unwill
ing to join organizations which were dis
cussing social or economic conditions; it
was only after a long struggle that the.
more liberal members succeeded in intro
ducing what Is called, for want' of a'bet
ter name, "practical work"; In other
words, "to translate sentiment into ac
tion " From their inception the State
federations were more democratic than
was the general federation; they, have
forced the latter into accepting a more
liberal and progres3lvo policy. The an
nual due of the State federation la a
small one; many clubs having a small
membership or a small annual due "feel
Inclined to join. The State federation has
not refused to admit clubs composed of
religious bodies,- while <a' clause in the
constitution '-of tho : general - federation
was until quite recently so interpreted
as practically to debar such societies
â¢from membership. The State federations
hold annual meetings, while those of the
general federation are biennial. "While a
freatÂ« effort has been made to hold these
iennial meetings in different sections of
the country, the attendance of delegates
from the States situated at the greatest
distance was of necessity very small. The
place of meeting of the State federation
Is within the reach of all the delegates
and of a large body of club women. \ At
the annual meeting of a large State fed
eration,- like that of Â¦ New York, for ; in
stance, the attendance is nearly as large
as at the biennial meeting of the general
federation. 1 Societies and clubs which are
organized for practical- philanthropy, or
clubs which .work on .civic lines,- are
anxious to Join the State federation, as It
The State as a Unit of Action.
The lines of work carried on by tho
clubs and societies can be classified as
educational literary and civic. Â¦ In recent
years tho study of sociology has been
added, and a Tew clubs are now organized
on an Industrial basis. Naturally the
practical work which the clubs undertake
centers In the city or the State. Even
with the rapid centralization of the Na
tional Government all the governmental
acts which affect a man's comfort or his
dally life are those of the city, county or
State. There Is, consequently, a reason
why theso organizations selected the
State as the unit of action. The resi
dents of a State, outside a few large
cities, as New York, Chicago or Philadel
phia, have also a certain similarity of
aim and attain about the same degree of
culture; In each State of the Union there
exists a State standard of lifeâeduca
tional and industrial conditions are more
or less alike all over the State. It is man
ifestly impossible for the General Federa
tion of .Women's Clubs to formulate, still
less put Into practice, any line of study
or practical effort which will meet the
requirements of all parts of this widely
separated country. The president of the
State Federation, Â¦who is by reason of her
position acquainted with the. prevailing
conditions, is thus able to formulate a
plan of work which suits the members of
her federation, and she can select from

Growth of State Federation Influ
ences. .-
At the Louisville biennial meeting, held
in June, 1SS6, the principle of a recognition
of the State federation per se as en
titled to a larger representation than a
club was established. Since that meeting
the tendency has been to grant more
power to the State federations, to recog
nize the influence which they exert, and
to increase their representation and their
dues. During the period from May, 1S96,
to May, 1898. the following State federa
tions were admitted: Wisconsin, North
Dakota, Arkansas; Connecticut, Dela
ware, GeoYgia, Florida, Vermont and Ok
lahoma. Thus in five years' time twenty
nine States organized federations and
joined the general federation. During
that time Alabama formed a federation,
but did not Join the general federation,
and is thus the only one not affiliated
with her sister States. Since 1SDS six other
States have organized and become mem
bers of the general federationâ South
Carolina, Maryland, South Dakota, In
diana. California and Texas. At the
Denver biennial meeting In 1S9S. the
State line for the tlrst time was closely
drawn, and, being conscious of their new
found power, they forced the reluctant
assembly to enlarge further their repre
sentation and to introduce a per capita
due and In other ways to legislate for the
State federation per se as composing a
district body within the general federa
tion. From the Denver meeting dates the
agitation for a reconstruction of the gen
eral federation, not as a federation of
clubs, but of State federations and other
societies. J.

PHILIPPINE FfICTS.
ON the 4th inst., in response to an inquiry by the
Senate, the Secretary of War for the first time
made public this dispatch from General Mac-
Arthur:
MANILA. Dee. 25. 1900.
ADJTTANT GENERAL. WASHINGTON. D. C:
Expectations based on the result of the election have
not been realized. Progress of pacification is apparent
to me. but still very plow. Conditions very Inflexible and
likely to become chronic
The cheerful prophets who predicted certain ef
fects in the islands to be produced by the election at
home never had any substantial foundation for their
vaticinations. Had Mr. Bryan succeeded there would
have been little change, and his defeat was equally
without effect.
Our task in the Philippines is not begun, if one
treat as a beginning the entry upon a policy that is
to lead to a definite and desirable end. If only th
question of sovereignty were involved the way up
and out of the problem would be comparatively plain.
But this is the least of the issues.
The questions there underlie and overlie sov
ereignty. They are issues of land tenure, ecclesias
tical corporations asserting secular ownership, and of
sacerdotal privilege that have heretofore been dealt
with successfully only by the people immediately af
fected, in their independent and sovereign capacity.
If the Filipinos were a free and independent sov
ereignty they would solve in a year all that is in
soluble by the United States. That fact it is which
makes conditions inflexible and threatens to make
them chronic.
The American people have never been informed of
the whole body of facts about that forbidding and
abhorrent problem which they have undertaken to
solve.
When the General in command sends such a dis
pttch as that of December 25 and Congress appro
priates $400,000,000 in one year to the military and
only $360,000,000 to the civil purposes of the govern
ment, public- curiosity will be whetted for the facts.
The seeker for the truth must find it in a maze of
conflicting statements, and when found it will be a
kernel inclosed probably in a husk of religious preju
dice or partisan bias.
The most painstaking compilation yet made has just
been issued by Mr. H. H. Van Meter of Chicago,
consisting of official documents and authentic state
ments from a great variety of sources. But it is illâ
digested and lacks sequence, and leaves with the
reader the labor of rearrangement and the proper cor
relation of facts, with a reassignment in their chrono
logical order of those which are to be treated as
causes of effects, which are misplaced in the author's
disarrangement of his material
Yet with all its faults the book illuminates the
subject and presents a mass of material which will
inspire some one to a more orderly arrangement and
a close relation between premise and conclusion.
It is evident that the Philippine problem has ele
ments capable of producing the most profound dis
turbance in our domestic politics, and of transferring
to this republic some rÂ»f the burning issues which long
ago afflicted the Old World.
There is nothing cheerful in the outlook as to the
islanders themselves. The withdrawal of troops and
relaxation of garrison vigilance will likely be followed
by a recrudescence of their national aspirations;
sharpened by a spirit of revenge, and the inflexible
conditions will become chronic, as General MacAr
thur has predicted.
Dispatches announce that some of our solons
at Sacramento are becoming restless itid "hungry."
They should have a care to avoid any demonstration
which may lead them to the predicament of feeding at
the expense of the State,
There has been discovered in operation in Nett
York City a training school for beggars, so it eeems
that in the general spread of enlightenment every sort
of profession is going in for higher education.
It is stated that Pierpont Morgan's four months'
cruise now in contemplation is to be merely for his
heslth, but the chances are the old fellow has decided
to take a look at the earth before he buys it
ELLEN M. HENROTIN.
THE POWERS OF THE SENATE.
STUDENTS of the evolution through which our
system of government is' going, have 'been giv
ing much attention of late to the increasing
powers of the Senate. Two events of the present ses
sion have served to mark the nature of the increase.
First, the manner in which the Senators dealt with
various treaties negotiated by the administration
shows a tendency on the pa-t of the Senate to assume
something like the whole treaty-making power of the
Government. .
Second, the rejection of the war revenue reduction
bill sent up from the House, and the virtual creation
of a new bill under that title, implies an assumption
of authority to deal with revenue measures on its own
initiative;
The constitution provides that the President "shall
have power by and with the consent of the Senate
to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators
present concur." Under that clause the President has
been regarded as the diplomatic head of the country.
He it is who has had the sole right of initiating trea
ties. Once upon a time when Jackson was President
Congress undertook to take the lead in a matter of
diplomacy by passing a bill to compromise certain
claims under a treaty with the King of the Two Sici
l es, ; but Jackson vetoed it on the ground that the
constitution gave him authority for negotiating trea
ties with foreign countries and he had no need for
further authority from Congress. It will also be re
membered that the Senate once undertook to take
the initiative in treaty-making while Cleveland was
President, but was baffled in the attempt. This time
the Senators have been more successful. It has been
noted as a matter of some significance that in origin
ating a new convention in place of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty the Senate substituted the phrase
"treaty-making power" instead of the word "Presi
dent" when speaking of the authority by which the
convention was proposed.
In a similar way have been the aggressions upon
the prerogative of the House. Under the constitution
the House has the sole right to originate revenue bills.
The, Senators, however, have gradually built up for
themselves authority to virtually .set that rule at de
fiance. They took large liberties in amending the
McKinley tariff, the Wilson tariff and the Dinglej
tariff; but all that was done in those cases was as
nothing to that accomplished in dealing with the re
duction bill. In that case they virtually set aside ths
House bill altogether and substituted a new one.
When the Senate measure was reported to the House
objection was made to it on the ground of unconsti
tutionality, but the objection was not sustained, so
that a precedent has now been established whereby the
Senate can set aside a House revenue bill altogether
and make one of its own.
The two cases taken together show that the
strength of the Government is steadily passing into
the hands of the Senate. At the present time the Sen
ators have virtually obtained control of the civil ser
vice and claim the right to dictate a very large pro
portion of all the Presidential appointments. When
Cleveland was President two worthy appointments to
the Supreme Court were rejected by the Senate be
cause Senator Hill was opposed to them. If, now,
the Senate establishes the right to set one treaty aside
and make a new one, not in the name of the Presi
dent, but in the name of "the treaty-making power,"
and if, in addition thereto, it can set aside a revenue
bill of the House and substitute a new one, it will
have something like control over both foreign and
domestic affairs.
The laws of evolution apply to governments as to
individuals, and when once a certain tendency of
growth has been firmly set the progress in that direc
tion is af>t to be rapid. It is therefore worth while to
consider whether the time has not 'come when some
check should be put upon a body which has obtained
an unconstitutional control of patronage and is using
it to increase its power in every branch of the Gov
ernment.
The Chicago Judge who recently set aside a yer
dJct of a jury because it was based upon evidence
given by women has had the satisfaction of ; causing
a good deal of talk, but unfortunately for. him it is
notthe kind of talk that will encourage any one else .
Our local health officials are again playing fast and
loose with death. This time a patient at the Receiv
ing Hospital has learned that he died at the Countj
Hospital. He probably thinks that the doctors arc
determined to kill him even by proxy. .â¢
The Italian Ministry, which resigned a few days ago
was accused on the one hand of being too liberal and
on the other of not being liberal enough. Thi3 ap

General Roberts says that the'only.way in t which to

It Is now ten -years since the General
Federation of Women's Clubs was organ
ized, and of the many movements which
have directly or Indirectly been fostered
by It that of State federation Is undoubt
edly the most far-reaching in the In
fluence which it exerts. In 1S93, three
years after the general federation was or
ganized, the Iowa Federation of Women 3
Clubs, composed of clubs from all parts
of that State, some being members of ths
general federation though more were not,
applied for membership in the general
federation. As there was absolutely.no
provision in the constitution for a State
association the Iowa federation was ad
mitted on the same terms as an indlvia
ual club would have been, paying a bi
ennial due of $10 and sending tho presi
dent and two delegates to the biennial
meeting. In the early part of 1834 the
State federations of Maine and Massa
chusetts applied for membership and
Sre also Xltted on the Â¦gÂ»%^""K"
was Iowa. Between May. 1894. JJâ¢ May.
1896. seventeen States organized federa
tions -and were taken into membership in
the general federation, stilT on the same
baslf as Individual clubs, though by thto
time several of them -embraced I nearly -100
clubs in their membership. The States
thus admitted were Ltah, Kansas. IU1-
*
Many Improvement Associations.
Next in interest are the departments of
civics and town and village Improvement
societies. There Is a marvelous record of
what has been accomplished In this
branch of -work by the State federations
from Texas to Maine and from the Pa
cific to the Atlantic. Small parks have
been purchased, and dedicated to the use
of the children. The members of the New
Jersey federation are assisting in rais
ing the $500,000 necessary to preserve the
Hudson palisades. The California feder
ation is working to protect the large red
wood trees. Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania and Maine are attracting
attention to the question of forest pre
serves. The Illinois and Massachusetts
federations have a lecture on the plant
ing and care of trees, landscape garden
ing, and practical suggestions for town
and village improvement. The lecture Is
illustrated by slides, and is furnished to
the clubs of the State free of charge.
Georgia has a special department in field
and garden work.
Club extension is another important
branch of club work. In several Statesâ
notably Maine and Minnesotaâ this has
taken the form of establishing town ana
country clubs, where the city and country
women meet each other. -"Â¦ _- -.
In only four States Is philanthropy made
a distinct departmentâ Delaware. South
Carolina, South Dakota and Vermont.
Many of the Stato federations use the
terms philanthropy and social economics
as interchangeable. The following: States
have departments of social economics:
New Hampshire, Illinois, Colorado, Mas
sachusetts and Oklahoma: while house
hold economics is a department of study
in the following federations: Oklahoma-

i Establishing Free Libraries.
Public and traveling libraries are advo
cated by all the State federations. In 1S33
the State of New York Inaugurated the
traveling library system In connection
with the State library- The clubs of Ohio,
under the able leadership of Mrs Book
waiter, induced the State librarian to send
traveling libraries to the women's clubs.
The experiment was at once â¢Â» success.
Michigan has over 200 libraries for farm
ers' clubs and country towns. The Legis
lature of Iowa has adopted the traveling
library as a part of the State library sys
tem. Wisconsin has been very active In
securing traveling libraries. Senator
Stout originated the movement and fur
nished twenty-four libraries. Mrs. Mor
ris ex-president of the Wisconsin federa
tion was placed by the Governor on the
State board, and the clubs of Wisconsin
have furnished many of the libraries now
in circulation. Several of the Illinois
clubs have equipped libraries and started
them on their journeyings. The New Jer
sey federation has secured an appropria
tion from the State for this purpose. The
State federations of Georgia, Tennessee
and Kentucky have each a system of trav
eling libraries for the mountain districts.
Kentucky has fifty-five libraries, averag
ing flfty-flve volumes to the box, in circu
lation. The clubs are also collecting good
photographs of famous pictures and send
ing these collections to the rural districts
and to the mountaineers. In every State
the federations are organizing public trav
eling and school libraries.
Practical Work of Club Women.
The work of the State federations la
yearly becoming more practical. From
the recent reports of the annual meetings
some conception can be gathered of the
importance of the results obtained by the
State federations. It goes without say
ing that the chief interest of each one is
in educationâ beginning with the kinder
garten and extending to the university.
In all the State reports educational work
occupies the prominent position, while on
every programme is the topic of the edu
cation of* neglected, delinquent and de
pendent children. In Illinois the agitation
led by Mrs. J. M. Flower. Miss Lathrop of
the State Board of Charities and the late
Mrs. A. P. Stevens aroused all the
women's clubs, and the influence exerted
by the State Federation and the individual
clubs was a arreat factor in securing much
needed legislation for that class of chil
dren. The practical result of that legisla
tion is the assured fact of the Juvenile
court and the parental school. All the
State federations have advocated trÂ»e
founding of kindergartens in connection
with the public school system. In many
cities the Industrial clubs have supported
and are still supporting kindergartens,
while In many cities, as a result of tho
efforts of the clubs, kindergartens have
been incorporated a3 a part of.the public
school system. Several of the State fed
erations are devoting much attention to
the furthering of special school legislation.
One of the branches of work of the Mis
souri Federation Is reform In school laws.
South Carolina has a department of work
"establishing free kindergartens in. fac
tory counties and in neglected localities,",
and that federation has also secured free
scholarships for a large number of stud
ents in colleges. The Texas Federation
has a department to improve the grounds
about the public schools and furnish col
lections of good photographs to adorn the
walls. At the last annual meeting of the
New Hampshire Federation It was decid
ed to secure the needed legislation to es
tablish a home for feeble-minded children.
Up to that time the State had no place
for the care of this unfortunate class. In
Nebraska the State Federation is in active
co-operation with the State Teachers As
sociation- New York has a department
devoted to child study. Tennessee and
Georgia are working to introduce manual
training Into the public schools.

will become, as it were, a great clearing

Ohio, which has a membership of 230
clubs. Illinois comes next with "224 clubs.

membership, has only 28 clubs in the Gen
eral Federation. Maine, with a State
membership of 100, has but four clubs in
the General Federation, while Georgia has
but 12 in the national organization.
For tho last four years the General Fed
eration has relied entirely for its increase
in membership on the State federations,
and outside of the State federations th?
membership of the General Federation
has been practically stationary. The re
sult of this state of afTairs is lamentable;
the States will Increase in power and will
exert more and more influence in the
council of the General Federation. The
presidents of the State federations, or the
boards of directors of those bodies, since
the Milwaukee biennial meeting, appoint
the secretary* who has charge of all the
(ieneral Federation matters for her State.
The General Federation has. then, no di
rect communication with the clubs of tn<j

forj a per capita representation is being
pnfctlcally conceded, and a 10-cent per

to the fact that it generated or dis
tributed the latent electricity In the at

fluenced: the sick were to be restored to
health and there was to be a revolution
right away In the matter of treatment of
the afflicted. For sick persons from one
quarter to onÂ«-half of admitted light
should pass through blue glass, and for
plants one-eighth. The idea was given a
fair trial, but did not come up to expecta

General View of the Women's Club Move-.

(COPYRIGHT, 1901.)
tiori of the capital of California will have to "seek
employment '"not in growing more fruit but in manu-'
facturing fruit preserves. -
The result is: sure to prove beneficial an. the end.
We can learn in that respect a" valuable lesson from'
the Southern States. So long as cotton sold at 10
cent3 or more per pound there was no money in the
South for anything except cotton-planting. The
whole South had but that one industry. When the
output of cotton became so large that the crop,
brought hardly more than 5 cents a pound the indus
try became unprofitable to large numbers of people.
The lawyers, merchants, bankers and others who un
der the old price could make a profit from their fields
found themselves compelled to quit cotton-growing.
The industry would support none but those who di
voted all their energies to it. The consequence was
that all of the amateur cotton-growers were forced to
seek other investments for their money. Naturally they}
turned to the manufacture of cotton, and in a com
paratively . few years small . cotton mills sprang into
operation all over the Southern States.
Something of the same kind is about to happen in
California. The industry of fruit-growing in this
State will soon have to be left to men who make it
the object of their daily work. The amateurs will
have to quit the business. The money thus released
from the cultivation of orchards will be available for
use in the operation of fruit factories. We shall cease
shipping fruit pulp. We shallship the - finest jam3,
jellies and conserves in the world, and fruit which
would now be sold for a few cents a pound will then
bring ten times the amount.

THE HAWAIIAN DELEGATE. ]
THE failure of the attack on Mr. Wilcox will
admonish the people of Hawaii and teach them
the serious nature of the obligations imposed
jy annexation.
In the rush of adventurers to Honolulu which fol
owed the revolution of 1893 there was imported
learly every trick and artifice known to the politics of
;his. country. .These were -by no means in abeyance
iuring the interregnum between the revolution and
innexation, but were brought to bear to effect the
atter. It is one of the interesting incidents of the
ransfer of sovereignty to this country that the Ha
vaiian Government did not officially participate in the
ict that made transfer possible. That Government
-atified a treaty of annexation, which was also sub-
Tutted to the Senate for ratification, and failed. That
; ailure killed the treaty. It was void, null, and as if
t had never s existed. Therefore the action of the Ha
waiian Government upon annexation was also void,
md fell dead, ineffective and without force. The ef
fort at annexation perished on the doorstep of the
United States Senate. It would never have revived
bad not the Spanish war occurred. When that short
and not very glorious struggle occurred Congress
passed a joint resolution annexing Hawaii, and the
Hawaiian Government took no legislative action at
all nor did anything in the way contemplated by its
constitution. The United States simply went over
and took possession. The natives and their close
congeners seem to have comprehended the kind of
politics which that loose action implied, and pro
ceeded to fortify, themselves and prepare to do politics
on their own acount
When the first election took place there was an eye
opening surprise. The Republican and Democratic
parties had held conventions and made a campaign
in the good old-fashioned way. â¢ It was a continental
campaign, however, transplanted to insular con
ditions, and it failed to work.
The Republican and Democratic candidates for
Congressional delegate were snowed under, over
whelmed in a brotherhood of misfortune, and â¢ Mr.
Robert Wilcox, native, soldier, scholar, sentimental
ist, adventurer, revolutionist, was elected by a major
ity so large that a recount held out no hope, and a
contest was out of the question.
It is said the Kahunas did it. These Kahunas rep
resent the ancient priesthood, and their wink goes a
long distance with the native voter, whose respect
for Christianity has been somewhat shaken, and
whose faith in Pele has revived.
It is rather hard to find fault with the Kanakas and
the Kahunas in view of the fact that the other par
ties were conjuring for votes in the name of Chris
tian civilization. The Kahuna had the same right to
conjure and exercised it with better effect. He stood
for the other kind of civilization, -for the Hawaii of
the Conqueror, and won.
The victory of Wilcox may do us some good at
home. We must not expect to expand into the
tropics and carry our America there. We must thus
early get accustomed to the peculiarities of the va
rious tribes of men we have taken in. Annexation
does not extend New England climate, pie for break
fast, Chicago politics, Tammany tactics and all our
other gifts, graces and virtues to the equator, to
prevail unchallenged. The native article has to be
reckoned with.
After all there are other Kahunas than those that
conjure under the alligator pear trees of Hawaii. Mr.
Croker is the great Kahuna of Tammany, who ren
ders unto, no man an account of his incantations, and
has he not been hailed as a prophet by that oth;r
peerless and oratorical Kahuna of Nebraska?
There was no just cause for refusing Mr. Wilcox
his seat. He is a picturesque person with a pictur
esque record, representing a picturesque district;
and. after all, it is. probable that if his two com
petitors, the Hon. Sam Parker and Â¦' Prince David,
were scratched the old order would be found just as
close to their skins as it is to his. If we are to have
Polynesia in this Union let it be represented not only
by Polynesians in blood but in belief and in prac
tice.

CIVIL GOVERNMENT
POR THE PHILIPPINES
For a Pacific Cable.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19. - Senator
Hanna, from the Committee on Com
merce, to-day made a favorable report to
the Senate upon Senator Perkins' amend
ment to the. sundry civil appropriation bill
A bill was passed to extend to the sub
port of Everett. Wash., the privileges of
the Immediate transportation of dutiable
merchandise without appraisement.
Teller said a system of hazing had
grown up at West Point totally unlike
that In any other institution in the coun
try. It ought to be suppressed with a
strong hand. Men who practiced that sort
of brutality, he declared. werÂ» unfitted for
the command of Amerltpn soldiers. "The
people are outraged by tnis practice." said
h*. "We have got to stop it. or eventu
ally dismantle the institution."
The conference report was then rejected.
Allen of Nobraska In opposing any
change in the penalty prescribed by the
conference report for hazing had read a
part of the report of the House committee
which investigated the death of young
Booz. which he declared had "no parallel
for barbarity in prize-fighting, in bear
baiting or in bull-fighting."
Tillman said that those, cadets who prac
ticed hazing upon their physical inferiors
were "brutes and dogs," and he doubted
whether the provision against hazing
could go too far.
"This school at West Point." he assert
ed, "has become a disgrace In the eyes of
the world on account of hazing."
Depew in opposing the hazing penalty
declared it had been adopted under public
clamor, and that Congress had acted upon
impulse rather than upon Judgment. He
agreed that dismissal from the academy
ought to follow conviction of hazing, but
the young man. he scid. Ehould not leave
West Point with a brand upon him.
Butler urged that Congress ought not
' to" be swept off its feet by popular clamor.
! He believd that" in this Instance Congress
was enacting extreme legislation without
I due consideration. He said hazing in
Â¦Â¦ moderation was not a thing to be put
I down by penal legislation. He had known
i men in college who were the better for
1 hazing in moderation. It did them goodâ
{ took the conceit out of them.
This action came at the conclusion of a
spirited debate upon the provisions
against hazing Inserted in the report by
the conference committee of the two
branches of Congress. Discussion of the
provision, which was precipitated at the
close of yesterday's session by Daniels of
Virginia, occupied the greater part of to
day's session, and the report of the con
ferees was rejected because it was regard
ed by a large majority of the Senate as
too drastic, and while no instructions
could be given the conferees by the Sen
ate it was understood that to secure fa
vorable action by the Senate a modified
provision as to the penalty for hazing
would have to be presented and agreed
upon by the conferees.
Sewell called up the conference report
on the military academy bill, which
aroused the opposition of Daniel of Vir
ginia, at the close of yesterday's session.
Sewell- defended the action of the con
ferees, holding that they had followed the
instructions of both the Senate and the
House. He declared that many people
thought Booz -was killed by hazing, and
that If there was anything this country
demanded it was a law to prevent such a
crime as hazing.

IN THE SENATE
"I would -give Nevada a day in court to
litigate her rights as against those of Cal
ifornia," replied Cannon. "But I think It
will be far better to make out of Nevada
â¢with its 40,000 inhabitants, a respectable
county of California."
"Do you believe the reservoir sites in
California, from which Nevada could be
watered, should be ceded to Nevada?"
asked Newlands.
"In some respects," said Cannon, "I am
a pretty good Democratâ better than some
of those calling themselves such on the
other side. I believe in local self-govern
ment. I will vote to give every acre of the
arid lands to the States in which located
and to give to those States the power to
go into the courts and to allow them to
determine as between themselves their
rights In the mr.tter. I don't believe any
other policy can be pursued without mak
ing the population of the arid land States
dependent upon the United States."
After some further remarks by Mondell
of Wyoming, King of Utah and Bell of
Colorado, Cannon, chairman of the Ap
propriations Committee, concluded this
branch of the debate. The arid land Sen
ators and Representatives, he said, had
arrived at the conclusion that the time
had come to irrigate the arid lands at the
expense of the Federal treasury. Cannon
predicted that if the scheme were entered
upon It would cost more than $750,000,000
in the next fifty years.
A somewhat similar resolution of In
quiry addressed to the Secretary of State
also was adopted.
The House then resumed consideration
of the sundry civil bill. The item appro
priating J100.000 for the investigation of
underground currents and artesian wells
In the arid land regions and the prepara
tions of reports upon the best methods of
utilizing the water resources of those re
gions Jed to a considerable debate upon
the subject of the irrigation of arid lands.
The whole question was threshed over.
Hill of Connecticut said the great scheme
of irrigation would cost the Government
$36,000,000,000. Rowlands of Nevada said
those figures were chimerical. >>
Resolved, That the Secretary cf the Treasury
be requested to Inform the House if "our ports
or waters" have been used for the exportation
of horses, mules and other supplies for use In
South Africa, and if so to what extent, and
what steps have been taken to prevent the
.Â¦ame; also the number of horses and mules
that have been shipped since the beginning of
the war In South Africa to the present time.
Bivlng the shipments from each port and the
dates.
Chairman Hltt of the Committee on
Foreign Relations reported back the reso
lution of Inquiry introduced by Xapphen
of Massachusetts, and it was adopted.
The resolution is as follows:
The feature of the day was the debate
upon the question of national irrigation
of arid lands in the West, which came up
incidentally. No material amendments
were placed upon the bill to-day. Cannon
reported the Ia3t of the general appropria
tion bills, the deficiency.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The communi
cation received from Embassador Tower
at St. Petersburg respecting the Russian
sugar duty is said to have been little more
than a terse summary of the opinions of
the Russian Ministers ajid newspapers as
to the prospects of further trouble be
tween Russia and the United States.
The Embassador made it plain that in
his estimation there was little danger of
any strain being put upon the friendly
political relations existing between the
Lnited States and Russia, while there was
a general conviction among newspapers
and in public that the present economic ls

NEW YORK, Feb. 13 âThere was an element
among the professional operators on the Etock
Exchange which worked for 'a rally to-day
en the theory that yesterday's selling was
largely due to operation* for the bear account
and that vigorous support of the market would
<rlvÂ» these bears to ccvpr. The maneuver was
entirely without success especially In the early
dealings, but all cf th<s markefs strength was
confined to a very few stocks and was not
long maintained. EuÂ«)r.ess fell away to the
point of Kemi-stacnatlo.-i at tiroes during the
Â«lay. showing no signs ot the recent large gen
eral demand or of operations by large bank-
Ing or financial Interests, which was the back
bone of the market for a long time. Obviously
none but professional Â«jÂ«>-rators were interested
to any great extent In the day's transactions.
There are too many dubious considerations In
the Immediate future to have a pressing in
fluence en hpeculation, which has been busy
for a long time past in discounting all the
irost favorable considerations that could be
Imagined and many of which have entirely
failed to occur thus far. Expectations con
tinue to tiptoe of an official announcement
cf the terir.K of the steel merger, which are
almort hourly expected, and yet lt is evident
that the cumbersome project may drag for a
long time. The steel stocks were all feverish
and unsettled, but generally weakened during
the ct'ur*e of the day. The money market
n-aÂ« not violently disturbed, but the tone con
tinue* to harden. A development which may
In discount rat<*s in Londcn in *pite of the
funeral supposition thaf the bank rate will
be reduced this week. Sterling exchange hard
ened In New Ycrk on a. demand for remittance
by to-morrow's steamer. The decision' to close
thÂ« Stock Exchange from Thursday to Mon
day morning j was an Influence toward dull
ness. Delaware and Hudson was erratic,
breaking violently 6>4 from the top and closing

Eastern Livestock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19. â To-day's, operations
in Cotton futures were something over 500, COO
bales, while fluctuations were by turns favor
able to both factions, with the bulls having
rather the better position at the close. Belief
that the market had declined far enough for
the present, that the weak Ions interest had
been totally eliminated and that shorts had sold
themselves to a standstill led to brisk buying
for reaction at the opening. . The nervouÂ«<ne?iÂ»
of shorts Increased as the market advanced
until buying for this account easily overtopfiM
that for all other purposes. The market was
finally steady with prices net 5!gS points higher.
Nezu York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. ' Vi.â Business was less
active 'in tin to-day. Advices from London
were rather disappointing, showing a loss of
7s 6d to Â£123 2s/6d. This, together with the
expectations of larga arrivals In the near
future, prompted an easier feeling locally and
prices were 5@10 pointa off, February selling
at $26 95. with the anally spot basis $26 95Â®
27 05. Copper was, Â¦ aa usual, in a somewhat
nominal consideration and in the absence of

caEtmg at $16 62Vj. Spelter ruled quiet and
easy all day, with little buslneps reported,
closing at $3 97',s'34 Co. At London a loss of
2s 6d to Â£17 10s was recorded. Lead continues
dull and featureless at $4 37^4. Domestic iron

easy in tone, but prices remain nominally as
last quoted. At Glasgow pig Iron closed at

BOSTON, Feb. 19.â Manufacturers have suc
ceeded in lowering the prices of wool a shade.
This Is principally the case In the territory
grades. While there has been more activity in
the market this week yet the demand is con
fined to purchases for immediate use. Man
ufacturers are disposed to pay on the scoured
basis of 43@45o for fine medium and fine ter
ritory wools and enough' in the trade are in
clined to meet this demand as to make it a
fair .quotation in the market. This is no doubt
caused by the considerable holdings and there
is a desire to sell which gives the buyer the
advantage.

LOJvDONV Feb. 13.â Lord Kitchener,
commander in chief of the British forces
in South Africa, telegraphing from Pre
toria to the War Office under date o5
February IS, says:
"Dewet is reported still moving north
and now is west of Hopetown. He prob
ably will double back to the southwest.
The troops are prepared Tor this. A train
was derailed between Vereeningin and
Johannesburg this meming. but the Boers

Captain Seymour decided, after hearing
the result of the autopsy, to keep Mc-
Grath in the prison till the Coroner's In
quest and If the Jury exonerates him from
all blame he will be discharged. '
Policeman Tillman found McGrath at 5
o'clock In the vicinity of Tenth and How
ard streets. Tlllman says that on the
way to the prison McGrath told him he
had hit Hennessey on the head with a
club. This McGrath denies, and gays he
and Hennessey were the best of friends.
Dr. Luigl Domenico Bacigalupt. autopsy
surgeon for the Coroner, found that acute
alcoholism waÂ» the cause of Hennessey's
death. The heart was also in a bad state,
and the liquor drunk by Hennessey caused
collapse. Through abundant caution,
however. Dr. Bacigalupi sent the stomach
and contents to the City Chemist for
analysis. The report of the chemist will
be received within the next two or three
days. There was a slight abrasion over
the left eye, but It had nothing to do with
the death.
When Cummins reached Tenth and Mar
ket streets he was ordered to stop by Mc-
Grath. who got out and staggered down
Tenth street. Looking Into the hack.
Cummins saw Hennessey lying on his side
on the seat. He was unconscious. The
driver notified Policemen Fraher and Till
man. who told him to drive to the Re
ceiving Hospital. Hennessey was dead
when the hack got there.
McGrath and Hennessey attended a
lodge meeting on O'Farrell street Monday
night and both became intoxicated. They
visited several saloons and missed the
"last car." finally reaching a saloon on
Stockton street. The bartender at this
piece put them Into W. G. Cummins' hack
and told mm to take them home. ,
The body of Charles J. Hennessey Is In
the Morgue and Henry McGrath. who was
a friend of Hennessey, Is in the "tanks"

At first It was thought that the Union

in the nature of a "bluff" to prevent the
carrying forward of Senator Clark's'pro

have passed between the Rock Island and
Union. Pacific officials leave no room for
doubt that the Union Pacifle. particularly
since Its acquisition of the Southern .Pa
cific, claims the Southwestern territory as
Its own peculiar field and resents the In
trusion of the Rock Island.
Ostensibly the projection of the exten

Bemis was apprised of his wife's death
at a saloon at 777 Market street, and he
went out to the Receiving Hospital He
declined to speak of the causes leading to
the woman's death. In the places which
he frequented, the employes said that the
relations of the couple were extremely
happy. and no reason could be a-sitmed
for the action of the woman in taking
poison.
The mystery will probably have to be
sClved by the police.
Some six weeks ago Beinl3 and his wife
took rooms at 305 Eddy street with the
family of H. M. Templeton. But little
was seen of the couple. The husband
sper.t the greater portion of his days away
from home.
Shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon Mrs. Berais was taken to the Tera
pleton residence from some hotel on Bush
street. She came in a carriage and was ac
companied by a young woman who said
Mrs. Bemis was ill. She was carried to
her room and received such attentions as
her condition seemed to warrant. About
four hours later Dr. J. A. Macdonald of
313 Eddy Ftreet was called In and found
her In -a state of collapse.
He administered tonics and stimulants,
but as her condition did not Improve he
suggested that the woman be sent to tho
Receiving Hospital. She reached there
about 8:30 o'clock and died about two
hours later without the doctors being
able to render her any assistance. Her
body was later removed to the Morgue.
At her late residence H. M. Templeton
raid that nothing was known as to where
she came from or tisa r.ame of the woman
who brought hex to the house. Temple
ton said a partially emptied pint bottle
of wood alcohol was found in her valise.
Mrs. Herbert E. Bemis of 333 Eddy
street .died last night at the Receiving
Hospital from the effects of poison, the
nature of which Drg. Murphy ani
Thrasher were unable to determine.
Mra. Bemis and her husband . formerly
conducted a roadhouse near Cahunga. Los

WOMAN'S DEATH
SEEMS PECULIAR
Buckland is a German and 37 years of
age. He claims that he was discharged
from Company E. Thirty-fifth Regiment,
for insanity in October last.
John Buckland. a laborer, created a dis
turbance in the saloon at SOI Keamy
street while drunk last night, and after
being twice ejected returned to the saloon
and fired three shot3 at close ranse at
Charles H. Harriman. the proprietor,
without doing serious damage. That Har
riman escaped being killed is little short
of a miracle. He was leaning on the b|r,
reading a newspaper, when Buckland
pushed open the swinging doors and,
standing almost against tne saloon man,
drew a small-caliber revolver, and point
ing it at Harriman's head, fired.
The bullet whizzed past Harriman's face
and lodged In the wall. Again Buckland
pulled the trigeer. the leaden missile this
time tearing through Harriman's coat
sleeve, but without inflicting any injury.
Â¦ Buckland backed away and. taking de
liberate aim. nred a third shot. The last
ball struck. Harriman in the abdomen
and went through his shirt and under
garments, but with no other effect than to
leave an abrasion no larger than a pin
head on his skin. Buckland ran from the
saloon toward Pacific street, where Spe
cial Officer Sam Daggett tried to stop him
but was held at bay by the fleeing man,
who threatened to kill him. Datrcett
watched his chance and grappled with
Buckland, whom he soon overpowered.
With the assistance of Policeman Cava
naugh Daggett brought the man to the
Central Station, where he was locked up
on a charge of assault to commit murder.

A meeting of contractors was held yes
terday In the Montgomery-street ofHces
cf Charles A. V.'arren to take actlcn re
garding the strike of sand and gravel
wacon teamsters. Contractors Warren.
O'Brien. OShea. Tuttl<?. Cray Brothers,
the San Krancisco Construction Company
and the City Street Improvement Com
pany, controlling about 253 of the 300 patnl
wagons in the city, were represented at
the meeting.
After a short dl=cuF=ion the contractor*
concluded that the demands of the teajn
sters were without right and Impossible
of fulfillment and hence no effort to effect
a compromise with the strikers will be
made. The contractors agreed to g'>
ahead with their work as usual, take In
new har.ds to manage the teams and to
refuse any offer to return to work that
may be made by the strikers.
The impression was given out by the
striking teamsters that thfJr union Had
be*n recognized by the San Francisco
Trades Council and would be taken in by
th&t erranizatfen. It was stAted at the
mÂ«*<?tir:s of contractors that the teamsters
had b*en misled and doubtless led Into
their present difficulty through the belief
that tht:r union would b-e accepted by the
Trades Council, which, for the present ?lt
least, if said to be without foundation.
The contractors pointed out that the
teamsters had but little right, by reason
<"f thÂ» natur" of th*ir emplc}*niAnt. to ex
pect to become part and parcel of the
Trades Council, and though the applica
tion of the Teamsters' Union for admis
sion is now with th? Trades Council, the
same will net be acted upen for some
time.
A^i<iÂ» from the team*tprs=" apparent lack
of support the contractors point to th?
fart that the teamstersâ not In any sense
of the word being skilled laborer.*â are
raid fair waets- frcra Jl 3 to S2 a day.
Thf-!r demand for I. Z- 1 diy. shorter
hours and otht-r concessions will, hence.
not be granted. The contractors also
raised the point that even if before the
strike the teamsters were entitled to be
heard, tneir lack of consideration for their
employers, many of whom have contracts
covering Icr.g periods ahead, no longer
entitle? them to this privilege-
The brarcir.g-house plan, which is in use
by some of the contractor*, is another
source of grievance to the t"amÂ«t?r*.
"While it is true that a few contractors
have boarding-houses, which, in their de
fens-?, the contractors say keep nUiny of
th<? eÂ»s away from saloons and in a con
dition to work, all do not run these places,
notably Gray Brothers: but the teamster
did not discriminate between contractors
who did or did not conduct boarding
houses. This fact, in addition to others
stated, swerved as a further Incentive for
the contractors to go ahead and ignore
the Teamsters" Union.
Many teams were running yesterday.
Advertisements inserted in the dally
papers called many teamsters to labor
and within the next few days the con
tractors say they will be running full
force and the Teamsters' Union will have
lost its fipht.
The striking team drivers are awaiting
a chanc in weather conditions before
phowirs: their strength. They met In
force yesterday at their headquarters at
1155 Mission street and discussed their
plans for the future. The storm prevent
ed much outside work.

STOCKTON. Feb. 13. â The water around
StocXton has been rising: steadily all day.
Every ditch and slot:gh Is booming near
the danger point. The surrounding coun

just before dusk presented & scene of
swollen streams aa.i scores oi big lakes
In the lowlands. The valley is dotted
with sheets of water. \ .;." =
There has been a steady movement ol
water from the foothills all day. The Cal
averas. Mokelutane and Saa Joaqala
rivers are being swelled not only by the
rainfall, but by melting snow. Mormon
Slough, which carries away the water
menacing: Stockton from the east, is with
in a few inches of leaving its backs.
Stockton Channel lacks abou: two and a
half feet of reaching the streets and
should the day's averajce of a two-Inch
rise an bear continue during the- night a
dangerous condition would exist. So far
the big levees protecting the lowland
and reclaimed U!and3 are holding, but
those who have millions of dollars at
stake will j.i^s an anxious nisht.
A message from LJnden thia afternoon
stated that Mormon Channel was bankfull
at that point and ns:n? fast. The Cala
vera3 River had overflowed and flooded
many farms and a part of the town of.
Unden. The Prather and TVltherly
ranches were under water. At that time
it was raining hard and LJndea residents
were moving goods out cf their cellars.
The operator sent word that Fair Oaks
people be warned to look out for very
high water before morning.
"There 13 little danger yÂ«t cf aa over

are very likely to go out ta different parts
of .the county.
PENNGROVE. Feb. 13.â The heaviest
rainstorm that has visited thi3 locality la
years set In early Monday nvornlns and
at a late hour to-nipht there is no pros

be benefited by the rain, while no dains.gÂ»
will result to the growing irraln.
WOODLAND. Feb. 13.â As a rule ti*
rainfall here during tha month of Feb
ruary Is very Ugat. Last year It was
orly .32 of an lch. This year It Is nearly
4 inches to date and the recoTd for the
season is about 13 Inches. The Indica
tions are that February of 13C1 will bÂ« a

concerning the season's rainfall, based,
upon past experience, will be upaet.

be made on account of the parents of the
defendant, but it was the duty of the
court to uphold the example contained in
vhelr lives and to protect societv at large,
and not to uphold or palliate the unlawful
acts which it believed were committed by
the defendant.
The Judge went on to say that he d!d

as he was satisSed his life had been with
out reproach until the transaction re

punishment he was not Insensibly to the
infiuence created by the presence of the
defendant's, parents at every stage of the
case. If the court could within the per
formance of its own conscientious duty be
swayed by their devotion to the defend
ant and the facts that he had reached
mature manhood without a previous vio
lation of the law. and that he had been
able to invoke throughout the ordeal not
only the devotion of his parents but also
the warm support of many other persons,
the task of passing sentence would **e
easier. The court, however, had Its own
views and Impressions of the case and
was convinced that already a very gr^at
leniency had been shown the defendant
by the verdict which had b?*n rendered.
With that verdict the court had no fault
to find and only referred to It In expla

NEWMAN, Kans.. Feb. 19.â A band

Joint was kept locked and the Jointlsts
forbade the entrance of the reformers,
who thereupon broke in the door. They
completely demolished a costly cherry

ONE CRUSADER BADLY HTJRT-
L.EAVENWORTH. Kans., Feb. 19.â
Twenty masked farmers with shotguns
attempted to raid a saloon in Millwood, a
small place fourteen miles north of here,
last night, and in the melee that followed
Mrs. Rose Hudson, wife of the bartender,
v.as instantly killed, her head being com
pletely blown off. William Webb, one of
the raiders, was shoi.in the arm and two
or three others were slightly injured. One
hundred shots were nred. To-day John
and Henrs "Wilson, ycung farmers, mem
bers of the mob. were arrested and war
rants are out for others implicated. The
town is in a fever of excitement and
further trouble is threatened.
The saloon was run by Mrs. Michael
Lochn^r She had been warned to close
tre place by Monday, but refused. At 10
o'clock last night twenty men. all armed
and wearing handkerchiefs for masks,
approached the saloon. Two of the num
ber. Jo* Turner and John Wllburn. en
tered and ordered drinks. Bartender Hud
son had scarcely oet the glasses on the
bar when the men eave a signal. Imme
diately the door -was burst open and the
marked men rushed into the place.
Half a dozen shotguns were raised to
the celling and nreÂ«.i. apparently to show
the saloon-keeper that the raiders meant
business while two men approached
Hudson ' with leveled guns. . Hudson
prabbed the barreis of both for an in
stant then fell to the floor. The runs
Â¦were discharged as he fell, the charge
from one striking the wall and that from
the second piercing the stove.
Mrs. Hudson rushed to the scene from
the living rooms in the rear and stood in
the doorway. She had barely reached the
spot when a gun was leveled at the door
and discharged. The shot struck her In
the forehead above the eyes, and she fell,
mortally wounded. Hudson rushed to his
wife's side to ftld her, but she died before
he could carry her to another room.
During the shooting William Webb, one
of the raiders, vram accidentally shot In
the arm, and two or three others -were
wounded slightly. A few more shots were
fired, but the mob. alarmed at the killing
of Mrs. Hudson, quickly left the place
without stopping to destroy the Iiquor3
and fixtures.
Anticipating the attack. Hudson had
gathered about him ten armed men. They,
however, being taken by surprise, were
stampeded, and this fact and the killing
of Mrs. "Hudson probably prevented a
bloody riot.
The affray lasted but a few minutes, and
details were not learned until this morn-
Ing, the raider? having" gone quietly to
their homes. The members .of the party
are all believed to be young farmers who
live near Millwood.

BARTENDER'S WIFE KILLED.
WICHITA, Kans.. Febl 19.â In view of
the fact that many armed men are arriv
ing 1 In. Wlnfield to-night from bordering
towns and the fact that all saloon men
are defiant and refuse to leave, It 13 be
lieved a battle -will ensue to-morrow when
the Law and Order League commences Its
trip over the town to rid the place of
ealoon fixtures which have not as yet
been removed Jn compliance with the order
sent to them a week ago. So alarming
has become the situation that Mayor Al
bright this afternoon issued a proclama
tion declaring ' Winfield in a. state cf ter
ror and orderinc all good citizens to go
armed to-morrow and use their be?t In
fluence to prevent bloodshed. The Mayor
savs the situation is critical and he ex
pects bloodshed unless the -saloon men go.
No less than a thousand temperance "peo
ple have armed themselves to run out the
saloon men tomorrow at noon and smash
all their fixtures. The saloon fixtures
have been stored and the saloon men re
fuse to ship them out of town.
A visrllance committee to-day issued an
order threatening to hang any saloon man
Â¦who harmed any crusader. Women will
go with the ministers and other temper
ance people. Raids are expected on the
Winfield Commercial Club, which Is com
posed of young business men. The club
is suspected of serving liquor to its mem
bers.

MINSS A.ND MINING.
MOXTEZUM A~ COPPER STOCKS have ln-
creased In value 100 per cent since we placed
them on the market a short time ago. A
similar or greater Increase will follow in the
next few months. While work Is being act-
ively pushed now the force will be doubled
and quadrupled In the spring and, summer,
and It will not be long until the Montezuma
Mining Company will ship ore. or. better yet.
smelt It at the mines. That means dividends.
It Is our belief Montezuma shares will pay
more In dividends during the next few years
and for years to cotne than any other mining
stock on the coast. Other stockholders, big
and little, share our opinion for the followlns
reasons:
The Montezuma Company owns and con-
trols 24 valuable copper properties In the
Cascade Range. 50 miles from Taeoma. The
mines are permanent assure veins and can
be worked chiefly through drainage tunnels,
thus dispensing with expensive machinery.
There. Is ample supply of timber, coal, water
and lime. The ores are simple pyritlc. easily
emeltered and concentrated. The Montezuma
has no debts, no mortgages and Its manage-
ment represents the highest character In the
State of Washington. Under the laws of that
State the stock Is non-assessable. Xumcrous
assays show uniformly high percentages of
copper, with enough sliver to pay for work-
Ing. Ten assays give average value of $61 23
per ton. Five assays give average value of
-$70.
Stockholders will t hare In the profits from
1300 acres of valuable coal lands recently ac-
quired by the company.

Is offered at 7c cash and 8c on Installments. Â¦

With the arrival of George Crocker,
president of the Pacific Improvement
Company,, who is speeding to San
Francisco from New York, one of the
largest real estate deals in the -history of
this ' city will be consummated. It was
learned yesterday that the proposed trans
fer of tbe city holdings of the Pacific Im
provement Company to the Southern Pa
cific Railroad will shortly be carried out
and all the deeds turned over to the Har
riman syndicate. * "
Advices were received in this city yes
terday stating that President Crocker
would be here In a few. days, and with
his arrival j preparations will be i com
menced to make the enormous real estate
transfer. The city holdings of the Pa
cific Improvement Company are valuable
to the Southern Pacific- It was the plan
of the late C. P. Huntington* to secure
the holdings of the Pacific. Improvement
Company, and several times negotiations
were pending . which nearly closed the
eale, but a question of value between
Huntington and George Crocker stood in
the way. ,It is now positively known that
President Crocker will, on his arrival, go
over the repJty block" by block and defi
nitely place a price upon it. with the in
tention of effecting a ready cash sale to
the Southern Pacific Company.
Among the holdings of the Pacific Im
provement Company- perhaps the most
valuable pieces of property to the South
ern Pacific Company, are the several
blocks between Fourth and Sixth streets
and Kentucky and Channel streets, which
are valuable for terminal purposes. The
Pacific Improvement Company also holds
valuable tracts of land between Illinois
and Kentucky streets from Fourth to the
Tubbs Cordage walk on Nevada street
The city properties of the Pacific Im
provement Company are estimated to be
worth $3,500,000, and a prominent rallroa.l
official stated yesterday that he knew the
Southern Pacific would pay spot cash for
the properties.
The present stockholders of the Pacific
Improvement Company, are the- represen
tatives of the Huntington estat*, the rep
resentatives of the Mark HopkJns estate
Mrs. j Stanford and ) George Crocker, rep
resenting the. Crocker estate. ;
In the . recent big deal the - Harriman
syndicate did not . secure the Mexican In
ternational Railway, as the property be
longs to the Paciiic Improvement Com
pany. The Mexican International Com
pany, which has about 700 miles of road.
Is the only non-subsldlzed road in Mexico
This line was built practically by Collis
P. Huntington and It now belongs to the
Pacific Improvement Company. It is gen
erally regarded as the Mexican division
of the Southern Pacific system, but actu
ally the Southern Pacific management has
not control of the Mexican rcid. It is
now conceded that the syndicate will also
secure control of this Mexican road.

CHINESE slavery and racetrack
gambling: will Boon.be things of
the past if the efforts of the Law
and Order League count for any
thing. The organization, which
is composed of the leading 1 ministers and
some of the foremost business men of this
city, has taken up the fight and does not
piopose to. rest until the two terrible evils
are wiped out for all time.
A meeting df the organization was held
on Monday night in the Young Men's
Christian Association building. The slave
question and the- agitation against the re
opening of Ingleslde were taken up and
discussed at length by those present.
Rev. F. K. Baker read a personal letter
from Hon. J. R. Knowland, chairman of
the legislative committee which recently
Investigated the condition of things in
Chinatown. The writer spoke of the
great Importance of the Legislature paÂ«s
ing; two bills which were presented on
February 18, which would prevent the sale
or purchase of human beings and the
holding of them In durance, and also an
act to amend section 1747 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, relating to the appoint
ment of guardians and providng for the
temporary custody of minors and for
vesting in the Superior -courts the power
to issue warrants to prevent minors from
being taken away during the pendency
of guardianship proceedings. Dr. Baker
spoke strongly In favor of the bills, as
did also Miss Margaret Lake, superintend

matter and the lmpossibllty of presenting
at this meeting formal resolutions which
the Law and Order League would deem

APTEB TRIUMPHS ABROAD
She Will Appear in "TTxu
First Born."
May Buckley, the petite and clever
actress, who was such a favorite with
local theater-goers, returned from the
East last evening after an absence of two
years and is staying at the Occidental.
Miss Buckley expressed herself as being
delighted to be once more among her
friends. The successes she achieved in
the East have not turned her pretty head.
She is the same little woman who delight
ed Alcazar audiences with her splendid
acting. .
During her absence Miss Buckley ha?
played In New York and London and in
both large cities the critics spoke well of
her acting. Miss Buckley went East to
play in David Belasco's production of
"The First Born" and was a member of
the. company that played in England. On
ner return to the United States she was
engaged by Charle3 Frohman and ap
peared in "A Summer's Day," "Kather
ine" and "Hearts -ire Trumps." At the
close of her engagement with Frohman
Miss Buckley joined Litt, the well-known
manager, and scored a great hit as in
genue In the dramatization of F. Hopkin
son Smith's splqndld novel,, "Caleb "West,
Master Diver."
At the close of the season the popular
actress accepted an offer from Messrs
Belasco & Thall to appear at the Alcazar

The moral people of San Francisco have in the past stood solidly against
that which degrades and destroys manhood. Are we going to surrender that
which has been gained by such persistent effort without orotest? "We are

Albert Schaible, an assistant cook In the
Odeon restaurant. O'Farrell street, plung
ed a knife Into the left breast of Louis
Irlon, a dishwasher, about 6 o'clock yes
terday morning during a fight in the
kitchen, and Irion may die, as the knife
penetrated the apex of the heart.
The two men had not been on friendly
terms and Schalble blamed Irion for try
ing to get him discharged. Schaible
reached the restaurant about 5:30 o'clock
yesterday morning and half an hour later
Irion made his appearance. Irlon, so
Schaible says, was In a quarrelsome mood
and asked him what he had done with the
hatchet, as he wanted to split some kin
dling wood. They had some hot words
about the hatchet and Irlon grabbed
Schaible by the neck and threw him face
downward among a lot of coal and began
punching him on the back. . Schaible
yelled for help, but no one came. He
managed to get on his feet and warned
Irion not to come near him again, as he
had in his hand a long knife with which
he cut vegetables.
Irion attacked Schalble again and Schal
ble plunged the knife into his left breast.
Irlon fell to the floor with the blood pour-
Ing from the wound and Schaible contin
ued cutting his vegetables as If nothing
had happened. When the chief cook ar
rived he told Schalble to "get out of
here," and he went to his home at 410
Clementina street.
The police were notified and Irlon was
removed to the Receiving Hospital, where
bis wound was pronounced fatal. Detec
tives Dlnan and Wren and Policeman
Knorp were detailed to rind Schalble.
They fo-jnd him In a saloon at Fifth and
Tehama streets and took him to the City
Prison, where he was booked for assault
to murder. He admitted the stabbing, and
when told that Irlon might die, he said
he did not care. He is. a short, thick-set
man, 58 years of age, and has been in this
city since 1891. He is unmarried.
Schalble was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and Identified- by Irloh, who re
fused to make an ante-mortem statement,
as he did not believe he would die. He
made a statement, however, that corre
sponded with the one made by Schalble.
Fight in Odeon Restaurant
That May Have a Fatal
Result. s
The schemers who planned to loot the
estate of Giovanni Cuoco have two weeks
more time In which to perfect the plot.
The matter of the distribution of the es
tate to Theodore Bacigalupi, who claims
title to the so-called "desert" land in Kern
County, by virtue of a deed given him by
the Italian Consul, was calleu for hearing
yesterday and by consent of counsel was
continued by Judge Troutt. While the
hearing of the Bacigalupi petition was
continued for two weeks, it is more than
probable that another postponement .will
follow. .The i.ext continuance will be
granted on a showing that the heirs, who
are residents of Italy, have been com
municated with by mail and that there
has not been sumclent time allowed to
permit them to reply.
When the Bacigulupl petition came up
for hearing: in Judge Troutt's court yes
terday . morning. Attorney Bates, wljo Is
acting tor Bacigalupi, and Attorney
Charles G. Lamberson of Vlsalla filed a
paper asking that the motion for re
appralsement be denied. He also objected
to the confirmation of sale to rienry
Bohls. who bid $:W0 for the property. The
sale to Bohls was first confirmed, but was
subsequently set aside by Judge Troutt
upon his receiving information to the ef
fect that other people were willing to
pay $25,000 for the same piece of land.
G. Gunzendorfer, attorney for Bohls,
was present and objected to the entire
proceedings. "Mr. Bohls bought the prop
erty, in pood faith," said he, "and has
paid the purchase price to the former
Public Administrator. An order made by
the court confirming the order of sale to
my client was set aside a few days ago.
We claim that the court has no right or
authority to set aside the order of con
firmation of sale and we have taken an
appeal to the Supreme Court from the
decision. The matter of calling for new
bids interests us not in the least. We
bought the property in good faith, being
the highest bidder, and are now ready to
dispute any adverse title."
Timothy J. Lyons, who represents the
Italian Consul, said that his client had
been grossly deceived when he sold the
land to Bacigalupi. "The Consul." said
Lyons, "appreciates the fact that he was
lied to by the people who were plotting to
rob the estate. The deed he gave as at
torney for the absent heirs was given by
him under a misunderstanding of the
facts. Bacigalupi bought the land for $800
and when he obtained it for that price
there was no notification to the Consul
that other people were willing to pay more
than double that amount. It has been
asserted that the consulate was taking
more than an ordinary interest In the
property involved. That is untrue. The
Consul has been anxious to secure the
highest possible price for the land In order
that the heirs may receive their rights.
All that Consul Serra asks Is that the
property be sold to the highest bidder and
that the proceeds be distributed among
the heirs. We ask that the property, be
so sold or disposed of that the heirs may
receive their dues." i
Attorney Ruef, who represents ex-Pub
llc Administrator Drlnkhouse, announced
that he and his client were badly deceived
In the sale. "We have no Interest to sub
serve that may not be made public. We
are here to fipht the case and obtain for
the heirs the most money possible. It has
been charged by some that the suit
brought by S. N. Griffith and W. S. Wagy
to quiet title to the land patented by
Cuoco was only a bluff to keep out Bohls.
That suit will be fought to the bitter end
and It will then be seen that there has not
been any collusion on our part."
The continuance of the proceedings was
granted at the request of Attorney T. J.
Crowley. who appears for F. Razzetto.
The power of attorney was originally sent
him by Cuoco's heirs. At that time Raz
zetto did not think there was any value
attached to the estate and turned over
his papers to the Italian Consul. Now
that he has learned that the property may
be worth several hundred thousand dol
lars ho asks for time to communicate with
the heirs and ascertain what steps they
intend taking to set aside the deed given
to Bacljjalupl by the Italian Consul.
