ried out, since the various factions have
united and a plan of parliamentary cam
paign has been adopted which i3 likely to
make the present session one of the liveli

ment legislation is to be opposed up to a
point where closure is necessary, and all
private bills are to be talked to death.
With eighty determined Irishmen com
bined Into relays and committees for con
tinuous opposition, the campaign of ob
struction Is certain to be unprecedented.
j "We will Interfere in every piece of Eng

new leader of the Irish party, to The Call
correspondent. "No matter whether It
refers to an extra gYant to the crown or
to a tramway line in the north of Scot
land, tfie Irish members will fhave some
thing to say about it.
"We have eighty determined men, whoso
object is to get Justice to Ireland. by every
possible means. England has Interfered
In Irish matters long enough. Now, we
propose to turn the tables. The other day
we wanted to extend the boundaries of
Dublin. It was purely a local matter, but
we were defe'ated by the votes of the Eng
lish and Scotch members. Now we'll sho*v
them what we can do In the way of Inter
ference with their business."
"Does not the King's speech foreshadow
legislation favorable to Ireland In tha
way of the purchase of tenant farmsT*
Redmond was asked.
"Nothingr of the kind." he replied. "It
la merely, the shilly-shally of ""evasion.
I intend to move an amendment to the
address, calling for the compulsory sale
of tenant farms instead of the optional
sale, which the Government offers and
v.-hlch means nothing.
"They have to face a united Irish par'y
now. Including many cf their former fol

"Are you going to do anything relative
to the objectionable anti-Catholic oath?"
"We have a bill ready for Introduction

programme of the Irish members 13 car
ried out, since the various factions have
united and a plan of parliamentary cam
paign has been adopted which i3 likely to
make the present session one of the liveli
est on record. Every piece of Govern
ment legislation is to be opposed up to a
point where closure is necessary, and all
private bills are to be talked to death.
With eighty determined Irishmen com
bined Into relays and committees for con
tinuous opposition, the campaign of ob
struction Is certain to be unprecedented.
j "We will Interfere in every piece of Eng
lish legislation," said Jchn Redmond, the
new leader of the Irish party, to The Call
correspondent. "No matter whether It
refers to an extra gYant to the crown or
to a tramway line in the north of Scot
land, tfie Irish members will fhave some
thing to say about it.
"We have eighty determined men, whoso
object is to get Justice to Ireland. by every
possible means. England has Interfered
In Irish matters long enough. Now, we
propose to turn the tables. The other day
we wanted to extend the boundaries of
Dublin. It was purely a local matter, but
we were defe'ated by the votes of the Eng
lish and Scotch members. Now we'll sho*v
them what we can do In the way of Inter
ference with their business."
"Does not the King's speech foreshadow
legislation favorable to Ireland In tha
way of the purchase of tenant farmsT*
Redmond was asked.
"Nothingr of the kind." he replied. "It
la merely, the shilly-shally of ""evasion.
I intend to move an amendment to the
address, calling for the compulsory sale
of tenant farms instead of the optional
sale, which the Government offers and
v.-hlch means nothing.
"They have to face a united Irish par'y
now. Including many cf their former fol
lowers like Russell, and won't be able to
put them off with a subterfuge as here
tofore."
"Are you going to do anything relative
to the objectionable anti-Catholic oath?"
"We have a bill ready for Introduction

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â Under the
leadership of Cannon, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, a long filibus
ter consumed the time of the House to
day. Cannon desired the\ House to pro
ceed with the sundry civil appropriation,
while the Democrats desired to devote the
day to the consideration of private claims.
It was the last day under the rules which
could" be devoted to claims at this Con
greBS and notices had been sent out yes-^
terday asking the Democrats to be In their
seats to-day. As a result Cannon was
outwitted, but he kept up the light all day,
forcing rollcalls for three hours and later
filibustering in committee of the whole
The net result was that the whole day
was wasted. . ... ,, .
When Cannon was recognized he called
up the resolution to reconsider the vote
by which the bill to issue a duplicate of
a lost check drawn by William 11. Come
gvs, paymaster U. S. A., Irr favor of
George 1\ White, was passed. This bill
was passed on the last private bill day
and a motion to reconsider was entered.
There was much difficulty in getting a
vote, but finally the motion to reconsider
prevailed. The question whether the bill
should pass ordinarily would have come
next, but the Speaker held that a motion
to postpone the further consideration at
me bill until the next day? upon which
private bills were in order, was In order.
Cannon entered such a motion and it
was carried without division. This cleared
the way for Richardson, who moved that
the House go into committee of the whole
to consider private bills, and despite Can
non's objection, the Richardson motiou
prevailed, 120 to 103, and the private cal
endar was taken up. The remainder of
the session was occupied in disposing of
two small bills in committee of the whole.
Cannon continued to . fililbuster to the
end, and when the bills Were referred to
the House he made the point of no
quorum, and at 6:35 the House adjourned.
Friends of the Ship Subsidy Bill Are
Urged to Definitely Withdraw
INDICATIONS POINT TO
EXTRA SESSION OF CONGRESS
Measure for the Present.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â The Re-pub'I
can steering committee of the Senats
was in session for two hours to-day trying
to agree upon an order of business for tha
remainder of the term. Some of the
members of the committee suggested the
definite withdrawal of the ship subsidy
bill, but this proposition was opposed and
no decision to withdraw^ was reached.
There was â¢reassurance, however, on t'lu
point that the subsidy measure should not
be used to displace appropriation bills.
Upon the urgent representations of Sen
ator Spooner it was decided to jrfve the
friends of the oleomargarine bill an oppor
tunity to take it up and make an effort to
secure the action of the Senate upon it.
There was considerable discussion of the
prospect of an extra session and the opin
ion was quite general that the outlook in
that direction Is favorable.
As a. result of the deliberations oi the
Senate steering committee â¢ to-day, the
oleomargarine bill will probably be called
up in the Senate to-moirow to the tempo
rary displacement of the ship subsidy bill.
There is every reason to believe it w:il
fall of action. Indeed, there Is a quite
general understanding that after to-mor
row there will be very little consideration
given to any measures except appropria
tion bills and conference reports. TherÂ«
is considerable pressure on the friends .of
the subsidy bill to withdraw It, but So far
they have declined to yield.
FAVORABLE REPORT ON
THE ARID LANDS BIIxL
House Committee Recommends the
Extension of the Provisions of

WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.âRepresenta
tive Wilson of Idaho- from the House
Committee on Arid Lands to-day filed a
favorable report upon the bill to extend
the provisions of the Carey act Indefinite
ly. This act. passed In 1S35, gave to each
of the arid States ,1,000,000 acres of land
upon the consideration that the State
would reclaim them within ten years.
Since the passage of the bill Idaho. Utah,
Montana and Wyoming have made appli
cations for the segregation of 950.00O acres
for reclamation. It was found, however,
that the lands could not be reclaimed
within the period fixed in the Carey act,
and this bill extends the time Indefinitely.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â The Repub

to-day the question of reorganization of
the committees in the next 'session of Con
gr^Fs. The most important chairmanship
now vacant Is that of the Committee on
Foreign Relations. Senator Fry of Maino
is senior member of the committee, and
the disposition of the steering committee
to-day was to promote, him to the chair
manship. This would leave a vacancy In
the chairmanship of the Committee on
Commerce, and Senator McMillan of
Michigan, the new chairman of the Com
mittee on District of Columbia, will pr6b
ably be given that place.

the Minister of War, General von Goss

the conduct of the troops in China and
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee's

statements were without foundation. He
said that when Herr Bebel asserted that
a Prussian sergeant major could have bet

established a certain amount of order in
China. , The troops also deserved well of

THREATEN TO BOYCOTT
ASTORIA RAILROAD
Workmen Demand That the Japanese
Employed as Section Hands Be
Discharged at Once. *
ASTORIA, Ore., Feb. 15.-The laboring
men o.f the Northwest* ace viewing with
alarm the encroachments of the Japanese
and there Is a general effort on foot to
prevent the employment of the* Orientals.
Some time ago it was announced that a
sawmill, to be operated - solely by Japs,
would be started In this city, and the mill
employes were at once got into â¢ the Fed
erated Trade3. Restaurant employes
likewise joined the union as a precaution
against the inroads made Into the busi
ness of the white men by the cheap Jap
anese eating places, which do a thriving
business with the poorer classes.
The Astoria Labor Council of the Feder
ated Trades has now turned Its attention
to the Japanese employed as section
hands on. the railroads, and at a recent
meeting determined.to boycott the Astoria
and Columbia River Railroad Company
unless that corporation discharges the
Japanese employed by it. The local union
includes in its membership nearly every
worklngman In Astoria, and Is strong
enough, to compel respect for Its wishes.
Whether or not the railroad company will
comply with the demand cannot be stated
as yet, as formal notice will not be served
on the officials for a few days.
Should the railroad company refuse to
discharge its Japanese employes, there
will be a choice variety of local boycotts
on. At present the people of this city are
boycotting the Oregon Railroad and Navi
gation Company for Us refusal to extend
common point rates to Astoria, and not
a pound of freight is being received or
shipped by local merchants except a few
of the sawmills, over the lines of the Ore
gon Railroad. In consequence the Astoria
Railroad and the White Collar line of
steamboats have been getting the bust,
ness, the boycott extending also fo the
Kamm line of steamers. Should . the
trades union people boycott the local rail
road company, all the business ,of thia
section will go to the White Collar line,
which has always been friendly to As
toria.

"Do you think Miss Willard would have

WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.-That the op
position to the shipping bill in the Sen
ate will not permit a vote to be taken on
the measure at the present session was
made clear during the closing hours of
to-day's session. For several days It has
been evident that it would be difficult to
gain unanimous consent to take a vote
upon the measure, but not until late to
day was the frank assertion made that
the vote could not be had. At the con
clusion of several hours" consideration of
the bill Teller announced his purpose to
prevent a vote at this session. . In an im
passioned speech he declared * that he
would not consent to any agreement to
vote, and that it must be evident to the
advocates of the bill that no vote could be
had. This statement elicited a sharp re
sponse from Aldrlch, who insisted that
despite the declaration of Teller the busi
ness of the Senate would proceed in ac
cordance with the wishes of the majority.
Chandler asserted that the position of
the opposition was preposterous and Han
na, replying to Teller, became impas
sioned in his denunciation of the methods
employed by the opposition to defeat the
measure. â¢
Prior to these remarks Perkins of Cali
fornia delivered an eloquent and forceful
speech in support of the bill, but pointed
out what he believed to be defects in it.
He attacked especially the provision for
the admission of foreign-built ships. Ear
lier In the day the agricultural appropria
tion bill was passed.
Chandler declared that the opposition to
the subsidy bill was composed only of a
conglomerate of various political parties
and Insisted that the Senate and the coun
try would realize thoroughly that their
tactics were those of filibusters and noth
ing else.
Hanna of Ohio addressed the Senate
briefly on the bill jnd was given careful
attention both by the Senators and the
galleries. He said ihat he had listened
attentively with astonishment to many
statements that had been made concern
ing It by the opposition. Many statements
had been made, many insinuations had
been suggested that would bring the blush
of shame to any Senator's cheek. He had
listened "to the scolding of the Senator
from Colorado." but desired to remind
him that the Senators we're not children
and he desired him to understand that he
had a purpose and a desfre to withhold
and extend the interests of the advocates
of the pending measure. He did not
know, as the Senator had stated, that the
bill would not pass at the present session.
An honest and earr.pst purpose to secure
the passage of the bill was beinÂ» made
because its advocates believed that thu
enactment of the measure would tend to
the unbuilding of the merchant marine
2nd extend the shipbuilding industry of
the country.
"I know something, about economic
measures," said he. "I think I am en
titled .to the same consideration in con
nection with such measures as is accord
ed to any other Senator. I do not pro
pose to be considered as advocating any
measure to loot the treasury when I am
working for the Interests of the United
States."
He referred Incidentally to the efforts
of the Senator from Colorado and other
orators on the opposition stump during
the last campaign to 1<reak down the prin
ciples advocated by the Republican party
and shaking his fingtr at Teller he added:
"You got your verdict and you will get
it again."
He insisted that being honest and earn
est in his advocacy of the shipping bill
he should be accorded fair and just treat
ment.
"I'll not be sidetracked." he declared,
"by any Senator of the opposition. If 1
am to take a sidetrack I will decide my
self when I shall take It."
He next resented the Insinuations that
he said had been made against him as
the chairman of the National Republican
Committee and denounced them as unfair
treatment in matters of legislation. He
said he was not advocating the pending
bill in the interest of his party, but in
the interest of .the whole world.
"If it is the object of measures pending
before Congress merely to get money out
of the treasury," Â»:ald Hanna, In con
clusion, "what is Uie river and harbor
bill? I say that there are propositions In
that bill that would make the shipping
bill look pale."
' Teller made a brief reply to Hanna and
the Senate, at 6 o'clock, adjourned.

SEATTLE. Feb. 15.â Will C. Davis,
stage manager of the Stag Theater at
Wardner, Idabo, was stabbed twice with
a butcher-knife by Marie Doyle, an act
ress, last "Wednesday evening.
News of the tragedy was received In
this city to-day by one of the perform
ers at a local theater. Davis will prob
ably recover, but If complications should
set in there would be little hope for him.
The knife entered his chest twice, arc* it
is thought pierced hi3 lungs at^Kch
thrust. r^
Both of the parties are well kSowa
among theatrical people of the Pacific.
From the evidence gathered during the
Investigation of the case, it appears that
the stabbing was due to a brutal attack
of Davis on his wife, the Doyle woman
being drawn into it through the appeal of
Mrs. Davis for assistance and protection.
Davis had been drinking hard, and on
returning home. Wednesday evening,
commenced abusing Mrs. Davis in a most
shameful manner. Mrs. Davis stood It as
long as she could, but fearing bodily
harm rushed out of the house and fled to
Mrs. Doyle's home, some distance away.
Infuriated and almost out of his senses
from liquor Davis gave chase, but the
door was closed and locked before he had
time to force his way in.
"Let me In Immediately!" cried Davis.
He was refuged. "If you don't open up,"
he then said, "I will break down the
door."
Thia conversation was punctuated with
many vile oaths.
The Doyle woman, instead of belne
alarmed. Informed Davis that If he did
not go away she would carve him Into
shoe strings with a butcher-knife. Davis
paid no attention to the warnlns. but,
smashed in the door. As he did so he re
ceived two pavage thrusts from the knlfo
the Doyle woman had in her hand. Blood
burst forth in streams and Davis fell to
the ground. Dr. Mason was called and
dressed Davis' wounds, which are de
scribed as dangerous but not necessarily
fatal.
No statement is made aa to whether
arrests ha\ r e been made.

"Speaking of commercial activity." eald
a resident of the -upper West Side. "I've
seen some pretty smooth schemes for
reaching the public, but I was introduced
to a new one this morning that I thought
was worth the admission, fee.
"I was spending an odd half hour at ray
piano when I -was Interrupted by somÂ«
one knocking on the door of my apart
ment I found a modest-looking youtn
standing in the hallway. He might havo
been 20 or thereabout, though at first
sight he looked younger, and was nattily
dressed in a gray raglan coat of the lat
est cut, patent leather boots and neat
black derby. He carried an alligator skin
music roll under his arm.
" 'Good morning," he said. "I heard you
playing as I came along the hall and I
stopped to ask If you would like to hecr a
rather pretty thing I picked up the other
day.'
"By this time I found myself folio-wing
the youth Into the next-room, very much
surprised and somewhat inclined to resent
hi3 freedom. He seemed quite at east. He
leisurely took off hU gloves and spread
his hands out over the heater in the man
ner of a visitor of long standing 1 , all the
while rattling on about the present cold
snap, the weather In general and other
non-committal stoplcs.
"Presently, when he had warmed the
stiffness out of his fingers he sat down
at the piano and began to play. I listened
to indifferent waltzes for five or ten min
utes and was about to interrupt when he
wheeledvabout, and, reaching for his
music roll, asked me which of the pieces
I would take. As the beauty and sim
plicity of the scheme struck me I leaned
forward with enthusiasm, which he mis
took for a compliment, and said:
"Did you do It yourself or did some
body tell you?"
" 'I handle only my own music.* he an
swered with a touch " of pride In his
chubby face. 'Would you like a copy of
my new two-step? Here, I'll play It for
you.'
"I begged him not to trouble himself,
and after paylnp for two or three sheets
of music I asked him to tell ms about his
novel occupation.
" 'Oh. It's very simple,' he answered, 'I
have my music printed at my own risk
and I take this way of Introducing It- I
go through apartment houses like this
and ask at each apartment if there is a
piano. If they have one I get permission
somehow or other to try a few pieces on
it. Once Inside it's easy going. I am
able to make quite a number of calls dur
ing the day. and as a good percentage of
them pan out I managed to make the
business pay pretty well.'
"The youth left me shortly and I heard
him presently at a piano somewhere elsÂ©
In the house. I'll bet that If I'd started
out In life with that chap's ability to
hustle and a corresponding, amount of
cheek, instead cf a fond belief In the old

MENTO, Feb. 15.â The Governor's bill ap
propriating $100,000. to be used by him in
preventing the spread of contagious dis
eases In the State came up for third read
ing la- the Senate this afternoon. There
was a fierce fight over the measure when
it came up yesterday on second reading,
and there was every prospect that on
third reading there would be quite as
much for the Senate 10 say and to fight
over. The Senate tile of Assembly bills Is
a very short one, and it was expected
that the bill would coma up to-day, but
when the time came sdme of the "aye"
votes were absent, and there was a great
hurrying around of the administration
Senators. .
Curtin and Caldweli were absent, and at
2 o'clock, just before the Assembly bills
were taken up. Cutter rushed over to
Wolfe and said in an agitated whisper,
"Nutt Is absent, too." The ever ready
Smith of Kern was present and fully pre
pared for light, but. the friends of the
measure were already debating the ques
tion of a postponement and were looking
for a chance to consistently make the mo
tion. Just before the Senate convened,
however. Smith save them the opportu
nity by sauntering over to "Wolfe and-sug
gÂ«sting that the bill might just as well
go over if its supporters did not mind.
It was just what they had been lighting
against yesterday and Just what they
wanted to-day, but Wolfe said carelessly
"I'm â¢willing-, if you want it to go over."
And so when the bill was called up
Leavitt made the motion that It go over
to Monday, when, in its position at the
head of the Assembly nle, it will practi
cally be a special orner-for 2 o'clock.
It is known that the Governor does not
propose to use the appropriation of $100,000
to place health attaches on the State pay
roll. The money Is desired as an emer
goncy fund tp be used to protect the
health Interests of California. The good
faith of the Treasury Department Com
mission, now at work In San Francisco, Is
not questioned, but the refusal of the de
partment to permit the. State authorities
to join in the Investigation creates the
suspicion that the Influence of the United
States Marine Hospital Service Is being
used to sustain the false position taken
by Dr. Kinyoun. The influence may not
warp the judgment of the commission or
Impel it to depart from the instructions
to make an Independent and unprejudiced
report, but the Governor, however, wants
the sinews of war, so that he may be
prepared to resist*, any and all measures
to injure tho State. â¢ Â¦ .
The ' bill to create a State quarantine
officer did not emanate from the executive
office. The Governor, when apprised that
the bill had been Introduced, remarked
that he would not approve it. The bill
â¢was subsequently Â¦withdrawn. Governor

to the organization of the commission,
the election of Varncy W. Gaskill secre
tary and the engagement of headquarters
at the "Occidental Hotel, San Francisco.
It is mentioned in the report that Com
missioner Ben C. Truman had been, pre
vious to his appointment, officially con
nected with several other expositions and
that Commissioners W. AV. Foote and E.
W: Runyon "had visited and observed
several other previous expositions."
Reference Is made to the establishment
of headquarters of the commission at No.
8 Place de l'Opera, Paris. The head
quarters was about two miles from the
exposition grounds and the rental paid
for the same during the entire time of
the exposition, which was about six
months, was over JSOiO. The report says:
The rooms were liberally decorated, finely
furnished and contained many exhibits. Vis
itors were 'eutertalned in lavish style. An
abundance of California' wines- and other
l'.quors were kept on hand for entertaining
rurposee. The register of visitors was. not
proauced. but from the estimates of witnesses
about thirty persons visited the headquarters
faiir.
The orer>ond^rance of evidence is that the
elejtant headquarters was quiet and properly
conducted ar.d the published reports of drunk
tress, fighting and Improper conduct therein
have been -proved to be grossly -exaggerated.
The exhibit at the exposition grounds was not
a collect4ve or cumulative exhibit of tho re
rourees of California, tuch as was had at the
World's Fair at Chicago and at Hamburg, but
â¢waH a distributive exhibit, that is to say, the
rroducts . from the different sections â¢ of the
State .were scattered and merged with the
various classified exhibits of the world.
From the evidence we conclude that a col
lective exhibit would have b*-en more bene-"
ficial to the State, and that from the money
expended a much more effective exhibit could
have been made and the commercial interests
of the State thus promoted. The mineral ex
hibit had a regular attendant on hand to ex
plain and advertise the same to the visitors. -
It appears that the entire cum of $130,000 was
dr&wn out of the State treasury by the oom
irlssion and that about $112,000 wa* expended.
The commissioners testified that about $15,000
will; be returned lo the State treasury - after
all expenses have been paid. Vouchers tor the
disbursement of the entire amount- of $U2,000
have been presented to the committee for Its
Inspection,.; ... .Â»â¢
Many of these vouchers are indefinite and do
not explicitly Hate what the expenditures were
for, being grouped' under a bln.ple word such
as "incidental," "merchandise," "office ex
rt.nses," etc. We think such vouchers should
be made definite and more clrar before they
are accepted by tho State Controller.
Other vouchers are of a general nature, re
citing lump sums for "salary" and "traveling
expenses."
It appears from the minutes that In addition
to their salaries of JOOCO each the commis
sioners voted themselves addltirnal amounts,
to wit, Messrs. Truman and Foote an addi
tional $;*00 each and Commissioner 'Kunyon an
eddltlonal $4000. 'which were reported under
fcenerai vouchers as "traveling expenses from
fan Francslco to Paris and return," without
specifically stating the different items of ex
ptndlture. A portion of thin $14,000 was ex
rended for the living expenses of the commis
s'oners while in Paris. There Is nothing In
the act allowing them any amount besides
their salaries and actual traveling expenses,
but the Atorn-y General of this State, at tne
request of tee committee, has given the com
njlttee his wr.'lten opinion that the commis
sioners were entitled to their JI\ingr expenses
while In Paris in the dls-:harf,'e of their duties
as euch commissioners und!Â»r an Interpretation
of the words "actual travelim; expenses."
We think that those' vourfcers and others of
a like nature should show Â¦what the various
Items of exptnolture were and for what the
n.cney was expended befo.-e being accepted by
the State Controller. It appears from the
evidence that of the $13O,0C0 appropriated the
following expenditures were made:

The committee deals with the testimony
regarding the award of medals. The re
port says: â¢
According to the .testimony the Commission
ers left this matter of procuring medals in the
hands of Secretary Gasklll; to whom about
forty-eight exhibitors sent drafts in accordance
with the letters, > amounting to about J1410.
Gasklll claims to have indorsed these drafts
over to L.. A. Emlay. superintendent of Cali
fornia exhibits, and. Emlay in turn claims to
have cashed the drafts and gone to one M.
Lathoud, Alne and bought of him medals at the
prices quoted in the letters. These medals he
has brought home and distributed to those who
sent Gasktll the m-jney. None of these medals
(the 'cost of which is uncertain) have the in
scription Â¦ of the - successful exhibitors upon
them, as is usual at all expositions.
These medals were not made by the. French
Government, but by the said M. Lathoud Alne
who claims to have been granted the privi
lege of making them by the engraver. .
â¢ i There is probably not . now a ' real official
medal in the possession of any California ex
hibitor who had an exhibit at the Paris Ex
position. Such . exhibitors, however, to .whom
awards were made . can yet get tho official
medal Â¦ from the Â¦ French authorities * by
writing Alfred ; " Plcard, Paris, France,

which .the French Government . is charging ' for

medal and $3 for the best, silver medal. The
bronze medals .are furnished- gratuitously by
the exoOBltion administration. United States
Juror In Chief J. H. Gore writes that the
French Mint Is now ready to etrlke off such
medals when the requests are received. For
tunately the Juggling in medals in no wise
impairs the value of the prizes or awards won
at the exposition.
The testimony indicates .that the grosses*
fraud has been committed upon the exhibitors,
and It is Incumbent upon the commission to
see that each exhibitor so -defrauded by theue
non-official medals should be gotten regular
official medals from the French authorities or
the rrcney sent to Gasklll by exhibitors re
turned, as the Individual exhibitors may elect.
The Commissioners are morally and by their
bonds thould be legally bound to make good
to cxhlbltcrs . in lull for the frauds of em
ployes. -
We think that this entire transaction is a
matter for some judicial tribunal to take cog
nizance of. Â¦
It also aroesrs from the evidence that Su
perintendent Emlay by misrepresentation ee
cured thirteen contracts to work for exhibitors,
lie used his position as an employe of the
commission to force these contracts, and' his
testimony before your committee was as
crooked as his transactions. However, these
contracts were not consummated as far as
your committee was able to learn", because
Commissioner Foote refused to allow Emlay
to prpceed when the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce called attention to the proposed
"graft."
The turning over of all the ' goods at the
close of the exposition by Secretary Gasklll to
L. -A. Em'lay and his report that he .sold them
all for J-4C0 also has a suspicious look.
The . friction between Commissioners Foote
and Truman cropped out all alone the inves
tigation. Although Truman had cent back
many letters regarding the conduct of the
commission In Paris, 'the committee was not
able to get his testimony for the reason that
he tas not returned to America. He not be
ing Present to ansrver reflections that were
made as to his conduct, your committee makes
no -rencrt in regard thereto except to call at
tention to a letter by Commissioner Truman to
United States 1 Judee ' Ersklne M. Rom of Los
Angeles. In which Truman offers to use about!
$Â«X> of the State's money to pay the salary of
Mr. Robert Hoss as an attache of the commis
sion' for four months, during which he per
formed no services by reason of. as he claims,
an, unJURtlflable discharge. The testimony of
Mr. Robert Ross shows that Commissioner
Truman made the offer, but it was refused.
The act gave the Commissioners unlimited
powers and full control of the money for the
purposes for- which it was appropriated, and
neither- the Board of Kxamln*rs nor the Gov
ernor had anything to do with . the money.
It is hoped that- the Moose wording of the act
will be a standing warning: to all future Legis
latures to exercise more care and- caution In
the preparation of; acts appropriating public
Â¦money. - . : ' â¢
â¢In conclusion, your committee reminds this
body of lawmakers that although the horse is
cone, ' yet the barn door should be locked by
carefully worded laws In future appropriations.

ment:
"I had no idea of trespassing on the pre
rogatives of that committee or of this
honorable body. My only idea was in an
abundance of precaution to have Cram
present. If I erred it was rather an
error of Judgment than an intention to
violate any law. This Is my statement,
and if in your judgment I have been
wrong then it remains for you to do as
you think right and proper in the prem
ises. I leave the matter with your dis
cretion and Judgment under, the circum
stances."
The statement was made meekly, yet
without fear, for the Intimation had been
plain that if he did so censure wouid be
his only punishment.
Johnson moved that a recess be taken
until 2 o'clock that the members might
have time to think the matter over, and
this was done.
At 2 o'clock Johnson offered the resolu
tion which cites Sullivan. Wittman' and
"Wren to appear at. the bar of the Assem
bly. It was offered as a substitute for a
resolution by Schleslnger that Coffey be
dismissed. There was no opposition and
no dissenting voice was heard.
Coffey was allowed to go on his own
recognizance, to appear Thursday with
his companions in trouble.

went to the Governor. This morning he
returned it to the Senate with his signa

the amount expended out of J25.000 which
Spreckels loaned the State. The bill was
Introduced by Senator Flint.
The Governor also signed the miners'
bill appropriating $150,000 for the erection
of Impounding dams and forming one-half
of the balance of the JSOO.OOO required.
Senate bills 23 and 24, one to exempt
from taxation the lands held by Stanford
University and the other to grant it cer

The Governor's signature was also
affixed to the following Senate bills: No.

one this afternoon will prove no exception.
The field is an extremely smart one, with
Favonlus shinning forth as the bright
particular star. Beyond peradventure of
doubt the highest .classed horse on the
coast, he will go. to the post carrying top
weight, 124 pounds. Favonious is owned
by Burns & Waterhouse and that firm Is
likely to have three starters for the rich
prize, as Mortgage, Scotch Plaid and
Bangor are all eligible. Tom Ryan has
the giant St. Simonlan keyed to contfert
pitch, and with 10S pounds and Nash
Turner in the saddle, he has more than a
"look-in." Bookmaker Caesar Young will
take a chance with Sea Lion, allotted 09
pounds by the handlcapper. Fred Cook,
another bookmaker-owner, seeks a slic*
of the coin with The Monk. Dominick. a
great favorite with the public, has the
mount. Mounce has the leg up on- The
Fretter and with 109 pounds has an unde
niable chance. Although the route looks
far for him. Captain Hackett will send
Yellowtail along.
The probable starters, with the ridera
likely to pilot them, are as follows:

Judges Hunt and Troutt. two very en
thusiastic devotees, play nearly every af
ternoon and as a result are improving
v,ery rapidly. George Lane, another new
man. Is making great strides of late and
will soon be heard from. Judge Sloss and
Judge Kerrigan have expressed their In
tention of joining the California Club, and
as Judges Hunt and Troutt and City and
County Attorney Lane are already mem
bers, there should at least be order on
the local courts.
The University of California tennl3 try
out will be held next week and will be
productive of some rood matches, as a
number of high class players will enter.
From present indications the blue and
gold will be represented by Reuben Hunt

Although things are rather quiet across
the bay at present, the future Is very
promising. The Ladles of the Alarneila
Tennis Club will. elect officers next week
for the ensuing year.
A handicap doubles tournament for the
Davis cup will be played on the local

tendance to Monday and Tuesday games.
â¢ There Is another reason for this desire
to double up a little on the schedule. T..e
Northern California League Is to begin an
early schedule, so that the Southern Cali
fornia schedule will have to be cut short
about three weeks. This means, a loss to
the managers, unless they find a way to
even matters up. With four games a week
it Is possible to make up for the loss of
some of the April games. The schedule
as published has games dated until April
21. but now it Is understood that the
final game will be' played on March 24.
The defection of Krug and Francks, two
of the best players of the San Bernar
dino team, greatly increases the chances
of San Diego taking the pennant. These
two players became tired of San Bernar-:
dlno and determined to jump. .Francks
left for Los Ahctles and has played three
games with the Al Levys. but Krug re
turned to his home- in San Francisco.
Both are good men, either at the bat or
in the field, and they will be missed in
the San Bernardino team. Neither had
a release from the San Bernardino man
agement and it is quite probable that the
playing of Francks by the manager of the
Al Levys will- cause some trouble, for
Manager Kelly of -the San Bernardino
team declares that unless someone else is
put In to play Instead of Francks. the
game with the Levys will not be played
by the San Bernardino Club.
- Under the circumstances, the San Diego
fans believe that the chances for bringing
the championship to this city are fine, for
the San Diego team has not been weak
ened, at all;, but rather, strengthened by
constant" practice whenever the weather
would permit. , The' present standing .of
the teams is' as follows: '
WHIRLS OF THE WHEEL.
The road racing committee of the Cali
fornia Associated Cyclists is. making ac
tive preparations for the annual twenty
five mile handicap of the association to
be held over the San Leandro triangle.
The date was originally set for Wash
ington's birthday, but the constant rains
have cut the course up to such an extent
that it has been postponed, and will be
held either on the following Sunday, Feb
ruary 24. or on March 3. This will also
give the. riders more time In which to
train, and should result in a better race.
Owing to the postponement the entry
list Is still open and entries may be sent
to Thomas G. Spillane, chairman of the
racing committee, at the Olympic Club un
til next Saturday.
Through the efforts of the committee
the American Bicycle Company has been
induced to offer as prizes for this race
two bicycles, one to be given to the win
ner, the other to any rider who lowers
the existing record of 1:08:26, made by C
M. Smith In 1898.- y '
The Olympic Wheelmen will hold a try
out over the Almshouse and Ingleslde
road to-morrow in preparation for this
race, and the winner of this try out will
be given a special prize donated by" W

Tho South Bay Yacht Club is flourish
ing, and at its annual meeting appointed
a committee to form plans for building
a clubhouse. If. the members decide to
build a clubhouse it will be begun In
time to be ready for opening day In May.

built for them at CanrWrldge, Mass., by
Davey. Before it has reached California.
Al Rogers, the Alameda boat builder, has
offered to back the skiff he built toward
the close of last season for the Alameda
Boating Club against the new craft for
$100, maintaining that no skiff, designed
by an Eastern builder will prove as fast
in the waten of the bay.
The South End Rowing Club la not yet
quite ready to begin practice for the com
ing season, though Dr. C. C. Dennln and
his barge crew have gone out several
times already. The lack of a float, how
ever, makes launching a boat difficult, the
old float having collapsed in one of the
heavy winter storms. A contract to re
pair and keep in order for a year all the
boats of the club will be prepared by one
of the members of the South Ends and
will be presented to Al Rogers for signa

Frank Erne Intends to remain in this
city until May next,, for he has hopes of
securing a return match with McGovcrn.
He Bays he has no excuses to offer for his
defeat at the hands cf McGovern. and
simply wants another chance. Erne thinks
that McGovern will decline to take him on
again as he wants easier game. Frank is
delighted with this city and its inhab
itants. He is taking tilings easy and now
weighs 145 pounds. He says he can take
the extra weight off without rnueh eftori.
Erne contemplates entering the Hopkins
Institute of Art as a student. He has an
ambition to become an architect and he
beliex'es the' knowledge he can obtain as
a student in the local art school 'will be
of great benefit to him. Erne will surely
create a furor among the students of the
Institution if he enters. He In modest and
unassuming and bears none of the indicia
of the prize-fighter.
Willie Cole, the looal lightweight, re-
turned a week ago from the Orient. Willie
signed as coal passer on one of the army
transports and the effect of his hard
work in the lower region of the ship is
plainly evident. lie Is looking fine and In
ready to give battle to any man on the
coast at his weight. Cole expects to Ret
on a match with Herrara, the BakersfteM
lightweight. .
Al Smith is firmly convinced that Tom
my Tracey, the clever Australian boxer,
can take Otto Cribb's measure. He has
offered to bet Georgo Harding. Cribb's
manager, $o00. and as the latter is willing
to accept the challenÂ«. Otto may in the
near future enter the roped arena with
his -countryman. Cilbb is matched to
meet Matty Matthews before the National
Club next month. He intends eoinsr to

'It was arranged by the directors of the
Olympic Club to hold a boxing tourna
ment for the amateur championship of the
United States, and the winners in thÂ«
tournament held in Pittsburg in January
last were invited. to compete. Gold belt*
were offered by Herman Oelrichs, but the
tempting trophies could not induce the
Easterners to come to this coast. They
wanted pay for their hervices. but as the
Olympic Club is strictly an amateur or
ganization, negotiations were dropped. It
is. however, the intention of the local ath
letic club to hold a boxing tournament In
April. The handsome belts donated by
Mr. Oelrichs will be offered as trophies.
THE pugilistic pot is beginning. to
boll and is very likely to run ovr
with ail the plans in store for the
followers of putjilism in this sec
tion. Since the closing down of
the game In the Eastern cities the cham
pions and their contingents are heading
for this city, and some sport, good and
otherwise, is in prospect. Frank Erne,
the ex-champion lightweight, is already
here. Matty Matthews, who Is matched
to battle with Otto Cnbb next month, ifl
en his way. as is also Tim Hegarty. the
Australian champion, who may be pitted
against the "Terrible Terry." Tom
O'Rourke has threatened to bring a string
of fighters to this coast and Champion
Jeffries and Ruhlin may yet have to settle
their fistic differences in this State.
Under the present ordinance recently
passed by the Supervisors, but one profes
sional contest will be permitted each
month. This m^ans that the National and
the Twentieth Century clubs will have the
pick of the horde of boxers who are de
scending upon us.
The most important event in fistic cir
cles is the coming bout between Dal
Hawkins and Georsre McFadden. Theso
two clever lightweights will cattle before

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb., 15.-
Stanford varsity nine will make Its first
and probably only appearance for the sea
son â¢ In ,San Francisco to-morrow, when
Captain Edwards will take his men out
to the Sixteenth and Folsom street
grounds for a second game with the Fire
man's Fund team.
When the two teams met two weeks
ago the insurance men carried the day by
a 10 to 9 score. To-morrow the cardinal
aggregation will be little better .than it
was two weeks ago on account of a lack
of practice, due* to the inclement weather.
However, .the individual work of some' of
the, members of the team may be im
proved. Conner at third and Traeger,
catcher, should give a better account of
themselves than before. Parker should
also show improved form, as he went into
the first match with scarcely a warning
that he would be called upon to do the
-twirling.
The early part of the week was given
over to* class games, which also had the.
effect of detracting from team work.
Much interest Is being taken by those
who are trying for places on the cross
country relay team, which will compete
In the Olympic meet in San Francisco on
Washington's birthday. The competitors
are W. R. Hamilton '02, A. J. Zschokke

Sprague '04 and C. Elkus '04.
Track Captain Stewart has -not put his
men to work out of doors yet, as the track
is not in shape for use. In another week
it is thought that everything will be in
readiness for the squads to begin active
training. The freshmen have a. meet
scheduled with the Oakland High School
f or. March 1C. The next week they will
contest, with the University of Nevada
team at Reno.
BERKELEY, Feb.. 15.â The track men
have finished their light work, and now
under Trainer Christie they have .taken
regular practice. All of last year's team,
with four exceptions, are on tho track.
Jack Hoffman, the vaulter, has competed
four times and- Is Ineligible to intercol
legiate contests. , Drum, the sprinter;
Moser. and Broughton have left college.
California has no vaulter to compete
with Henley and Cutter of Stanford. The
only possibility is, Woolsey, , who may
come close- to Henley's record. Cooley
and Cheek, both freshmen, are good men
for the high jump. Hursey and Topham
are strong men for the broad Jump. Cad
ogan and Abadie will look after the
sprints. Service. Cregan. Bailey, Clifford
and^Redewell are-all good distance men.
Hamlin, Thomas, Cheek and Powell are
out for the high hurdles and Powell and
Thomas for the low hurdles. Plaw, Wool
sey. Albertson, LJgrda. and Peck are 'ex
pected to uphold California's part in the

Kid Parker in spite ol the fact that Par
ker was the aggressor throughout the
fight and landed oftener during the first
eight rounds. In the nlntn and tenth

breast smeared with blood. But his jabs
â¢were placed as he retreated from Parker's
rushes, his long reach coming Into good
play. Both men were *roggy at times
a& much from the piice they were coins
as from the blows received. It was a
slugging match mo&t of the time, led by
the Kid, who gave the colored boy no

for punishment..

CHOICES GO BY THE BOARD
AT OAKLAND AND TANFORAN
Zirl Runs Away From a Big BuncH of Two-Year-01ds Across the BaV-
Sol at 20 to 1 Plays Havoc With Field in San Mateo County.
AT OAKLAND TRACK
BY F. E. HULHOLLAND.
THE fields at Oakland yesterday
had a decided selling: plater taint
about them, though furnishing
some fair sport in which four
favorites were Â¦ ecnt to the
repair shop, Rio Shannon at 12 to
1. rioden by F. Kelly, a promis
ing boy. was the longest priced
winner, while Zirl. Scotch Plaid and Al
leviate entered port with all sails set at
comfortable odds. The track was still
Plow accounting for the time hunff out.
There was not a particle of class to any
of the starters In the opening mile run,
and Dr. Marks won in a canter. The win
ner closed equal favorite with Sam How
ard, beating the latter out eight lengths.
VaÂ«Â«alo from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable looked about the most eligible of
th<> thirteen starters in the two-year-old
dash, going to the post favorite. Zirl, a
nice looking filly by Imp. Sain, racing in
the colors of Felix Carr and second choice,
romped away Â»rflm her field, leading out
Winnabell. a <Xi tp 1 shot, six lengths.
Away none too well. Pepper Sauce fin
ished in the show.
In the third number, a mile and a fur
long selling run, Rio Shannon, an out
sider, ran in before both Socialist, the
second choice, and St. JRlca, the favorite.
Socialist, ridden by Devln. led until a fur
long from the stand, where he began
stopping. Shannon, under hard riding
then forged ahead, scoring by a length.
Carrying but Â£S pounds, St. Rica was a
fair third.
Evidently rot In condition after his va
cation. Gibraltar opened at odds of -6 to 5
In the betting on the six furlong spin
following and receded to threes. Showing
some early speed, he quickly fell to the
rear when the fighting became thickest.
Lenne. the 3 to 5 choice, took considera
ble- riding to , catch Scallywag, finally,
downing the triree-year-old two lengths.
Dominick on Haviland was third.
Da??ie Smith'b little horse. Horton. fell
by the wavslde in the mile anrf fifty yard
affair. Backed at short odds. Bullman
met with indifferent luck, getting home
third. The Monk displayed improvement,
but Scotch Plaid held the Cook entry safe,
receiving the verdict by a neck'wlth three
or four pounds in reserve. ' .
Running practically unbacked, .Alleviate
was first from flagfall to finish in the last
evÂ«nt. a six furlong selling run. The
mare's odds went from 3 to 6. Norford. a
well backed one. came from behind, se
curing the place from Foul Play. The
first choice. Nullah, quit badly in the
stretch.
Track Notes.
The great $10,000 handicaps are the fea
tures of the racing at both tracks to-day.
Mr. Holtman's starting was again
the feature of the sport at Oakland. Al
though given s-ome trouble by bad actors,
the starts were absolutely flawless.
Bullman piloted two winners at the
track across the bay.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
By Louis Honig-.
THE fifteen manipulators of the
bettlnp frame at Tanforan loft the
track Thursday nfgrht In no happy
frame of mind. During the mid
night and early morning hours
they Invoked their several gods of chance
and their lachrymose appeals were evi
der.tly heard, for there came a -cataclysm
yesterday that piu the bookies on top and
the consistent :avorite pickers under the
debris.
But a single pronounced favorite carried
the money yesterday and that was Dan
gerfteld in the third race. The plungers
went to this horse with more than ordi
nary fierceness and some very big bets
were laid soon after the books began
chalking odds. The price declined from
6-5 to 4-5 as the money rolled in and
the markers were registered. Tommy
Burns, who had the mount on the win
ner, rode a strong race with an exception
ally good finish, though at no time did
he ?Â»em in special danger of .a pass. Rio
de Altar and Cougar, the second and third
choices, hardly ran to form, although the
latter pteamed under the wire full of
movement and fast action. Enos on Nel
lie Forest caught the place. Miss Nellie
was adjudged one cf the slow kind before
the race and sold at 15-1.
Olinthus. 7-1. started the high ball rev
elry in the very first race, a selling affair'
for four-year-olds and up. The favorite.
Ilacetto. came In for the place, but at no
time was Olinthus led by nose, neck or
any other portion of horse anatomy.
Greatland beat Vain out for the show
by a well run finish.
Sol wltti Eno.s up burned holes in the
favorite and all the others of a pack
of ten in the three furlong event for two
year-olds. At the stretch Earl \V was a
head beyond the flashing Sol, but from
this point the 'iace lay between Sol and
J. V. Kirby, the second choice, which fin
ished something like a chain of noses be 1
hind. Snooze awoke in time for the show:
In the fourth race Matt Hogan surprised
talent and all by winning the eix fur
long race from a double quartet of In
different horses. Burdock, the favorite,
piloted by O'Connor, was never in the
running:- ,.
The rifth race, the mile 'event, selling,
was a sad-rea-waves sort of refrain for
Artilla, who ran a race that shamed the
pedigree. Tommy Burns had the mount
on this favorite, but could do no better
with her than fifth in a nelJ of five. Free
Lance punctured them all. in heart spots
due to the way O'Connor did the riding,
for not a .trick was lost. The place fell
to Josephine B.' who richly deserved it.
Walkenshaw, 40-1, fell in line for the
show. â¢
Phoeni??a's dirting start, a matter of
several lengths, as soon as the barrier
was raised, won ther six. furlong race,
the last on the card, for Mr. Boots. Hen
ry was up and it looked as if both rider
and horse were shot from a catapult. All
the rest tacked, but Phoenissa proved a
very distant acquaintance. At the wire
Parmenlon. a 4-5 favorite, was six lengths
behind. Lizella, the show horse, gave
Parmenion a. rub for second honors.
Higby Bill Passes Senate.
. The angling fraternity will be interested
to learn that what Is known as the Hlgby
fish bill has passed the Senate and is now
in the hands of the Governor, awaiting
"action.. The privilege hitherto enjoyed of
fishing for steelheads in tidewater at any
time of the year has been curtailed to the
period between April 1 and February 1:
Another feature of the bill which affords
protection- to sportsmen' is the clause
which, prohibits the '. sale or purchase of
any trout weighing less than half a pound.
The open season, which â¢ closes at present
on December 1, will in the future close on

Game Declared Off.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb.15.-The basket
ball game that was to have taken place
here to-day between the Redwood City
High School team and the team of the lo
cal high school was declared off. The dIc
fikin tossera from Redwood arrived in
time with an enthusiastic following but
the contest failed because the respective
teams could not agree on the rules. It
is reported that the local people wanted
to hit in the break away, while the visi
tors insisted that "pair holds" should be
permitted. Peacemakers tried to effect a
compromise and have the affair take, the
shape : of a go!f tournament on the local
links. This, however, was voted down
and the energies of the two teams wexe
devoted to making the dance at Native
Sons' Hall here to-night a success. They
were successful. . ... - .

THE most Interesting and impor
tant golf contest-, that- has ever
taken place-in California will be
the professional tournament at Del
, Monte .on "Washington's birthday.
Willie Smith and David Bell arrived there
last Saturday and will' be thoroughly fa
miliar with the peculiarities. of the course
and the sand putting- greens after two
weeks' constant practice; - Theother^par
tlcipants will be James, Melville, formerly
of the<Oakland Golf' Club," but ,nox- of '.the
Del Monte links ':' Horace "and- Harry .Raw-"
.Jins.'Tlobert Jphnstone and George 'Smithy
Possibly some" of the professionals- from
Southern California may come' up.'-but it
is somewhat doubtful whether the money
prizes will be large enough "to' attract
them from so long a distance. ; WlUx re
gard to the amateurs, many will doubt
less go from the San Francisco, Oakland
and Burlingame clubs. The' important
tournaments set for February 21. 22 and
23 on the links of the Los Angeles Coun
try Club, where the men's and women's
amateur championships of Southern Cali
fornia will be contended for, will engage
the attention of the principal amateurs
in that part of the State. The women's
championship was to have been playea
out on February 1 and .2, but the heavy
rains rendered this impracticable. At
the end of the last week the links of the
Los Angeles Country Club were covered
with pools of water and tall grass, so that
the green committee declared the course
closed until further notice. When tne
grass has been cut and the links are dry
the course is expected to be in fine condi
tion. The bunker protecting the seventh
hole, which Smith and Bell said was bad
ly placed, will be moved back so that a
good brassie shot will carry it.
The professional tpurnament at Del
Monto will take place on the afternoons
of February* 22 and 23. The amatenr
tournament will be played on the- morn
ings of the same days, the ladies' tourna
ment will take. place on the 21th and 26th,
the exact date not having been yet set.

GALUS RAGING^ FORM CHART
Favorites won more than their share of
decisions in the rundown of the 120-dog
open stake yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. In all there were but ten upsets,
the betting in nine of which averaged at
2 to 1. The other, however, proved a gen
uine surprise.
.Twilight. Jr., a despised outsider, found
but few backers agaJnst Curtis & Sons'
Kibosh, though the odds, 10 to 1, were
tempting enough. â¢ Kibosh never llgured
in the running, -Twilight taking: the lead
and winning: handily.
Liberator at 5 to 3 led and beat the fast
Grafter in a good trial. Royal Union ran
a great course with Cronin'a Wild Tralee.
If Union can'pass Royal Flush in the sec
ond round to-morrow he will probably 1>Â©
fighting for the flag near the bottom of
the curd. â¢-Â¦...
Sacramento Boy ran well against Psyche,
taking a lead of five lengths, which
Psyche' could not overcome. up-river
dog seems faster than usual, and it would
not surprise many to see him close to first
money when the final nag is raised.
Charta showed four lengths of.- speed
over; Golden Russet, which strengthens
the Judgment of her backers, : who predict
that a Uiance In the llnalis none too good
for her. Spiteful is ntarlng his true form,
while Wea&ewood is about ready for a
stake. King Cotton is in tetter form than
ever. In contrast his kennel mate. Nar
cissus, is out of condition and just took
the turn from Beauty Spot by favor.
Sisquoc led Lady Claire- two lengths, but
was t-eaten after the turn. Harlean
Gladys has tqunded into good shape after
a long rest. . She led Half Moon six
lengths.
-Agamemnon showed an increase of
speed, but a lack of determination.
For the stake War Kagle and Wedge
wood at the top of the card and Sacra
mento 13oy and Charta at the bottom are
In favor. Flying Fox, Harlean Gladys
Honesty, Chicago Boy and Little Sister
are in demand as second choices. Other
probable winners In the second round' are
King Cotton, Narcissus, Honor Bright
Twin City Girl, Tapioca, Lady Claire,
Daisy Claire, Liberator, Rocker, Law

Fiery Face, Best Bargain, Achilles, Miss

TOURNAMENT FOR GOLF
ENTHUSIASTS AT DEL MONTE
challenge Issued by the ladles of the
Oakland Golf Club the match is to be
over thirty-six holes, eighteen to be
played on the Oakland links and the re
maining eighteen on the Presidio course.
Saturday, February 23, and Saturday.
March 2. were the dates suggested by the
challengers, but the first of these dates
will conflict with the big amateur golf
tournament to be held on the Del Monte
links. As a special car had been char
tered to convey a large party of Oakland
ers to Del Monte for the tournament, it
Is not likely that the ladies* match will
be played at Point Adams on the Satur
day after Washington's birthday.
It is expected that the Oakland team
will be made up of Mrs. Le Grand Cannon
Tibbetts. Mrs. H. H. Sherwood. Mrs. P.
E. Bowles. Mrs. W. P. Johnson, Miss Beo
Hooper. Miss M. Deane. Mrs. Magee and
Miss Lucy Moffltt. Mrs. H. H. Sherwood
Is considered the strongest lady player on
the Alaraeda side of the bay and with
Horace Rawllns recently beat Mrs. R. G.
Brown and Harry Rawlins 1 up over
eighteen holes in an exceedingly close
match on the Oakland links. Miss Caro
Crockett will act as captain of the San
Francisco team, which will be picked,
from the following: "Miss Maud Mulling.
Miss Mary Scott. Mrs. R. Gilman Brown,
Miss Sarah Drum, Miss Florence Ives,
Miss M. B. Houghton. Miss E. W. Mor
gan. Miss Hager and Mis3 O'Connor.
. The ladle?' competition In driving, set
down" for last Monday morning on the
Presidio links, did not take place. It will
probably be dropped. On Monday the
qualifying round over eighteen holes,
stroke play, for the fourth competition
for the council's cup for women, will take
place on the Presidio links. The opening
round of the contest among the ladies
who qualify will take place on Tuesday
and the seml-flnal round on Wednesday.

The division of entomology studies the

desire to keep their homes free from an
noying Insects can learn much of value
from the publications of this division,
whether thÂ«y live in a congested city dls
tr ict or on'a Western ranch.
This division l:as recently been studying
mosquitoes, with the result that it an
nounces that 250 species are known, of
which only about twenty have been found
in the United States. Recently it has been
discovered that besides the other evils for
which the.se insects are responsible some
species assist in the spreading of malaria.
A recent bulletin contains a large amount
of information about these pests. Physi
cians are here shown how to extinguish
the mosquitoes which are responsible for
the spreading of malaria from those which
do not carry the malarial parasite. And
there is also pointed out the means by
which certain neighborhoods can be freed
of mosquitoes, and consequently of ma
laria. According to Dr. Howard, the
chief of the division, "the three main
preventive measures are the draining of
breeding places, the introduction of small
fish into flfihless breeding places, and the
treatment of such pools with kerosene."
Kerosene treatment has been successfullv
trieti on quite a large acale. On ponds of
any size the quickest and most perfect
method of forming a film of kerosene will
be to spray the oil ove.r the surface of the
water. On Staten Island, for example, a
country club practically stopped the
breeding of mosquitoes in ponds and
marshes in the vicinity during one whole
season by the use of kerosene.
CongTess last year passed an act giv
ing the department large powers regard
ing- the preservation and introduction of
birds and animals, especially those hunted
as game. This measure has attractei
widespread attention and has received the
support not only of game and fish protect
ive associations, but also of the Audubon
societies and bird lovers In general. It is
hoped that this will accomplish much for
the preservation of our native song and
useful birds" and the restoration of game
ln regions where it has now become
scarce. This work Is in charge of the

John M. Clayton was not a* mere politician by.ac
cident charged with making' a treaty upon a subject
in which he had no interest. As a Senator, in 1835,
he procured the passr.gc of the first resolution in
structing the President to negotiate treaties in Cen
tral America for the construction of an isthmian canal.
Speaking in the Senate in 1849 he said: "Whatever
the cost of a passage by railroad or canal across to
the Pacific by either isthmus (Panama or Tehuante
pec) .may be, whether two and a half millions, six mil
lions, twenty or fifty millions, I say, s*ir, that the wit
of man cannot find any other mode of expending the
same amount of money as much for the benefit of
this country and of the whole human family. And I
repeat that I do think that, in the middle of the nine
teenth century, it is a disgrace to the Government that
nohing has yet been attempted with success to save
our commerce the dangerous navigation of nine thou
sand miles around the cape."
After he made that speech he made the treaty. In
the session of 1853 its abrogation was proposed. Cass
introduced a resolution to inquire into the incidents
of its ratification, and. then ensued a season of Sena
torial twisting of the British lion's tail, which Gwin
of California tried in vain to end by moving to. lay
the resolution on the table. It was-adopted, but noth
ing further was done about it. until Clayton himself
re-entered the Senate at the next session and in a
speech that has never been answered vindicated the
treaty and justified his motives in making it.
The talk that runs now about denouncing, it seems
almost literally copied from that, debate on the" same
subject within two years of. its ratification. Clayton
stood then pleading for the canal as he had in 1835.
while those who opposed the work or who saw in the
discussion. only an opportunity to play the demagogue
and make_ political capital were doing just as tha
same class are doing now, and the canal waits' now aj
it did then.
WILL WE BREAK TREATIES?
THE Chronicle favors denunciation of th.5
Clayton-Bulwer Ireaty by the United States. I:
advises that we abrogate that treaty and violate
whatever honorable obligation it imposes, and de
clares that keeping faith when we pledge it is "gov
ernment of the living by the dead," which will not be
endured, because "one generation is not in any way
bound by the engagements of its forefathers." â¢
Among the ancients the most' enlightened held thai
there was the highest merit in the honorable obser
vance of treaties. Treaties between nations have in all
ages been considered as possessing unusual force and
solemnity. In modern times the close analogy be
tween a treaty and a private contract has been in
sisjed upon by all writers on international law.
By law a valid contract can be made only by 'one
qualified to enter the contractual relation. A minor
cannot make a valid contract. By analogy treaties
can be made only between nations which have the
power to discharge the obligation assumed.
The ancients. regarded a treaty as of especial sanc
tity. One of the earliest treaties was between Mace
donia* and Carthage, which in its preamble recites
that: "This treaty was concluded in the presence of
Jupiter, Juno and Apollo; in the presence of the
demon of the Carthaginians, of Hercules and Iolaus;
in the presence of Mars, Triton" and Neptune; in the
presence of allthe confederate gods of Carthage, and
of the sun, the moon and the earth;, in the presence
of the rivers, meads and waters; in the presence of
all the gods which possess Carthage."
It is of interest that no appeal to the gods proved
sufficient to make Carthage keep her word or observe
the honorable obligation of treaties, and as a result
of her bad faith she fell from the position of a world
power to be the spoil of the Romans.
In her case fides Punica did not pay, and there is
a question whether it ever paid any nation!
Macaulay says that there may be instances in which
individuals have thrived by bad faith and breaking
their promises, but history records no case in which
A nation has gained by either.
Yet the Chronicle desires to try the experiment in
the case of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty because to keep
it inviolate is "government by- the 1 dead."' If that
treaty is government by the dead, what is to. be said
of the constitution itself?
The treaty is only fifty-one years old, but the consti
tution is one hundred and twelve, and those who
made it are certainly deader than John M. Clayton
and the Taylor administration.
This country should' be the last' among the nations
to modernize Punic faith.
It is to be deeply regretted that the enemies of the
Nicaragua canal have succeeded in again defeating
that project by defeatirig the orderly and proper sub
stitute for the treaty of 1850. Had the Hay-Paunce
fote^ treaty been ratified, as it should have been, the
canal bill would now be the law and construction
would be already in progress.

UP TO THÂ£ LEGISLATURE.
WHATEVER doubts there may be concerning
the net results of the investigation made by the
Assembly committee concerning the operations
of the police authorities in Chinatown, there are cer
tain conclusions about which there will be no dispute.
First, the examination was not sufficiently thor
ough; and. second, it was not absolutely fair. It was
not thorough because ex-Police Commissioner and
ex-Chief of Police Biggy was not permitted to give
full testimony concerning what he had learned during
his experience while at the head of the Police Depart
ment. It was not wholly fair because much testimony
va3 permitted in which men were accused on hear
say evidence, while the witnesses were not required
to give the names of the persons who made the
charge?. Finally. Mayor Phelan was permitted to say
that the reason Esola was not chosen Chief of Police 1
ams that he is an uneducated man and unfit for the po
sition, but Esola was not given the privilege of tes
tifying and telling his side of the story.
In order that the mistakes of the committee may
be rectified it is the duty of the Legislature to reopen
the investigation and make an examination that will
be fair to all concerned, will be public, and will be.
thorov.fjh.
Moreover, the Legislature should inquire into the
case of Police Officer Price, who "from the rank of
lieutenant was degraded to that of sergeant upon
charges made against . him in connection with his
fervice in Chinatown. That case is one which in the
name of justice imperatively calls for examination.
At the time the charges against him were under
investigation Price requested the privilege of appear
ing before the board and presenting a defense. The
privilege was denied him. He was not even permitted
tq have a representative at the board when the evi
dence against him was being given. He was con
demned and degraded publicly upon charges heard in
secret. . - ' *
Now, after .all this time has elapsed and this officer
has been under that condemnation, in the investiga
tion before this legislative committee a Chinaman
named Chan Chung swore that he was requested to
contribute to a fund to be raised for the purpose of
having Price removed from Chinatown because he
was active in breaking up the gambling dens, and the
highbinders wished him removed. He testified that
$10,000 was raised for that purpose. When asked who
received the money he answered: "I won't say a
word about it. If you look up the records and see
who tried to hurt Sergeant Price you will not make
any mistake. You will not be far from the men who
got the money."
The condemnation of Price without giving him a
hearing or permitting him to confront the men who
assailed him was in itself a wrong; and upon the evi
dence now made public it appears the wrong was in
the nature of a gross outrage, inasmuch as it was a
wrong brought about by a corruption fund raised in
Chinatown for the purpose of getting an honest of
ficer removed.
There is no need of an argument upon these facts.
Gentlemen of the Legislature, the issue is up to you.
It is yotir duty to reopen the investigationâ to give
Esola a chance to reply to the statements of Mayor
Phclan: to gvve ex-Chief of Police and ex-Senator
Giggy a chance to make public what he knows of the
reasons why Mayor Phelan dismissed him from office
And above all it is your duty to. give Sergeant Price
a chance at last to vindicate his_good name and to ob
tain, if possible, evidence to convict the men who for
a bribe of $10,000 raised among the Chinese aided the
gamblers and the highbinders in getting Price re
moved and degraded.

BY-the action of the Police Committee in deciding to recommend the passage to
print of the ordinance legalizing pool-selling- and bookmaking at Ingleside race
track the issue of renewing that form of gambling in San Francisco is once more
brought before the people. The recommendation will in the order of things be sub
mitted to the Board of Supervisors at the meeting on Monday, and they will be asked by
Mr. Tobin that it be passed to print.- If this be done' by that body the ordinance will be
one step nearer passage, and the task of defeating it will to that extent be more difficult.
It is therefore once more the duty of the friends of morality and law to rouse themselves
and confront the danger.
The movement .of the gamblers is made, as before; under a specious guise. They
pretend they are seeking simply the privilege of conducting legitimate racing. In a state
ment furnished to the press for publication last Sunday the president of the San Fran
cisco Jockey Club, the organization now seeking to reopen Ingleside, said: "None of the
men interested in the San Francisco Jockey Club have cared to make money out of it.
In fact, if in five or ten years it cost them money to give seventy-five or eighty days'
racing during the heart of each winter they have made up their minds to stand the loss,
not only for the good of racing, but for the' benefit of the city of San Francisco and their
own amusement. Racing in the future will have to be of a higher class, and will begin in
the middle of November and will end early in April."
By that statement tire gamblers â¢ seek to deceive the people. The falseness of the
statement is shown by the fact that there is at present no ordinance preventing racing .in
San Francisco. The ordinance goes no further than to forbid pool-selling," bookmaking
and other forms of gambling upon races, matches or contests of any kind, either at the
track or elsewhere. If any set of men desire to have racing contests without gambling
they can do so under the existing law. There is no need for amendment nor for alteration.
The aim of tire ordinance whose passage to print has been recommended by the
Police Committee is not to legalize racing, but to legalize gambling. Its object is to open
at Ingleside track a place where gambling-can 'be carried on under the protection of law.
It is the desire of the gamblers to renew those practices which in the past have been so
profitable to them and so injurious 'to every interest of the community.
For the purpose of impressing the Supervisors with a belief that' some benefit would
accrue to the city and some "profit would be gained, the promoters of the. gambling
scheme have circulated petitions asking the Supervisors to pass the proposed ordinance.
The petitions have been presented mainly to the saloon-keepers, the owners of livery
stables, blacksmith shops, carriage-makers and others whose interests, it is said, are likely
to be promoted by racing. It has been argued that the maintenance of the track will in
cline people to hire teams Â¦ to drive to the races, that the business of blacksmiths will
prosper and that there will be a better trade for them. ...
Such arguments may mislead a few men into signing the petition of the gamblers,
but the more intelligent will not sign. How can any man pay a livery bill or a black
smith's bill or buy or hire a carriage if his money be squandered among the gamblers on
the track? San Francisco will lose in money even as she loses in morality by the reopen
ing of gambling at Ingleside, and all classes of her people who are engaged in legitimate
industry will share. in the general loss. â¢
Mayor Phelan has spoken .of the scheme as a permit for "pocket-picking." It means
that gamblers are to have the privilege of enticing the unwary to gamble and thus to
rob. them* of their earnings. The scheme is worse than pocket-picking, for past experi
ence has shown that it not only steals away a man's money, but robs him of his honesty
as well and leads him to the commission of crime in order to get money to continue
gambling.
The statement of the president of the San Francisco Jockey Club is that his asso
ciation wishes to hold races for seventy-five or eighty days every winter for "the benefit ol
San Francisco." Â¦ â¢
For the benefit of San Francisco! Is it necessary to recall to the public mind what
those benefits have been? Shall we have to go over again the dreary list of defalca
tions, embezzlements, thefts, robberies, assaults, suicides and even murders resulting
from the gambling at Ingleside track, in order to show what "benefits" this city derived
from the game? Is it required to recall the wreck and the ruin, the shame and' the dis
grace brought upon many families, some of them among the most respected in the com
munity? Can it be needed that we should again remind the public of those stories t.hat
came from the prisons and the Morgueâ stories of crimes whose stains could not be
washed out by the tears or even by the blood that was shed over them?
When the board meets on Monday the representatives of the morality and the business
of the city should be on hand to protest. Let it be. clearly made known to the advocates of
the ordinance that the people have no objection to legitimate racing. But do not intend to
tolerate pool-selling and Iwokmaking or any other form of gambling in San Francisco
either at a racetrack or elsewhere.
What the Federal Government Does for the
People of the- United Statesâ Aids
â¢y Given to Agriculture. A:
By Dr.A. C. True,
DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS, UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
(COPYRIGHT, 1901.) â¢Â¦
The United States Department of AgrK
culture is a " good example of a modern
government agency Which is devoted to
prompting the business interests of the
people. It has very little to do with con
trolling- their actions in any line. Its chief
function is to aid in the development of
our great basal industry. As' (Secretary
Wil?on has recently said: "Appropria
tions for Its use are, investments. It
makes direct returns by adding .to tho
wealth of the country. It gathers facts
and spreads Information. Much Is added'
yearly. to the profits of our farmers and
others as the result of its Investigations."
Beginning with the distribution of a few
seeds- and an appropriation of $1000 about
sixty, years ago in the patent office, the
department of agriculture hap grown to
be an institution employing over 3000 per
sons, of whom more than 2U0O are engaged
in scientific work as experts and assist
ants. It has an annual income of over
$3,000,000. It issues -about 600 documents
annually, of which it distributes about
7,000,000 copies. It has Important adminis
trative duties and a seat in the Presi
dent's Cabinet, but it is chiefly a scienti
fic establishmentâ the greatest in the
world. . '
It is a great mistake to ! suppose that
this department works solely In the in
terests of farmers. Under the organic act
which Is its charter, It is "to acquire and
diffuse among the people. of the United
States useful information on subjects con
nected with agriculture In the most gen
eral- and comprehensive sense of that
word."
It is proposed in this article to give some
examples to show the way in which the
department is fulfilling this broad mld
sion. It is no longer necessary to dwell
upon the advantage of tjie' department
to our farmers. They are now well aware
of the good work which it is doing in their
behalf, and are giving it cordial support
In its efforts to make this work broader
and more effective. The department's
work is also known to a considerable
number of persons, in our urban commun
ities, but there is yet a great mass of our
people who receive the beneilts of the de
partment's operations without any knowl
edge of their source.
Advance News of Floods and Storms.
The daily weather forecasts of the
weather bureau of this department are
printed in the newspapers and posted- in
thousands of places throughout the coun
try. ' These forecasts are correct* about
four-fifth? of the time.
The bureau not only has numerous sta
tions In the United States, but has ex
tended its system over the West Indies,
the Caribbean Sea and Mexico. It is thus
enabled to herald .the approach of storms
from the tropics as well as from the. north
and west.
The benefits of this service accrue to
people in all walks of life. They are es
pecially valuable to our great commercial
and shipping interests. The predictibns
of floods, frosts and storms often result
in immense saving of life and property
â¢In the spring of jo'j7 there was a great
ifood in the Mississippi Kiver. Many days'
before the river overflowed itE banks the
regions threatened were warned of the
coming flood. It is estimated that $15,009.
000 worth of stock and movable property
was in the flooded district, the greater
part of which was carried to places of
safety mainly as the result of the timely
warnings of the Weather Bureau. "When
the Mississippi River at New Orleans was
at the highest stage ever known warnings
were sent to that city that within five
days the gauge reading would show an
increase in the height of the water of
over one foot. The water reached Ihe
height predicted exactly on the day, but
the levees' had been strengthened . and
raised to meet the impending danger."
The Weather Bureau of the Depart
ment-of Agriculture, with its vast rami
tlcatlons extending into every part of the
country, is, in fact, the most extensive
and most efficiently equipped machine
anywhere in the world for the accurato
collection and rapid dissemination of cli
mate and crop information. The great
fund of cllmatological information col
lected serves not only to show the effect
of untoward weather conditions on grow
ing crops, but also to determine the agri
cultural possibilities of each State, the
weather conditions under which insect
pests thrive, and other problems of inter
est In tonnection with ths general science
of meteorology.
The records made by thousands of vol
untary observers also supply information
of incalculable worth to engineers in the
construction of aqueducts, reservoirs,
bridges, culverts, etc. Millions of dollar**
are annually expended in such work in
the United States, and without foreknowl
edge of the frequency, duration and
amount of rainfall in the several sections
of the country, to enable those in charge
of these enterprises to determine the capa
city of sewerp, culverts and similar works
that will prove adequate to carry off the
rainfall, disastrous mistakes are liable to
ocqur.
Study of Irrigation and of Foods.
Through its office of experiment sta
tions the department has intimate rela
tions with the agricultural colleges and
experiment stations now in operation in
every State and Territory, and similar in
stitutions throughout the world. The ex
periment stations employ about 700 per
sons in the work of administration and in
quiry along lines similar to those in which
the. department is engaged. The results
of the work of these institutions in differ
ent countries are collected by this office
and made available to our people through
numerous publications.
This office has recently organized a com
prehensive investigation of problems re
lating to irrigation. This work is vital to
the interests of the communities occupy
ing the western third of the United States.
Studies are being. made of the laws and
institutions of the irrigated region, as well
as of the uses made of irrigation waters.
This work is of Interest not only to farm
ers and fruit-growers in that- region, but
to all the population there, .and to invest
ors, merchants and manufacturers in the
East who have business relations with the
West.
Â¦ This office also has charge of special In
vestigations on the food and nutrition of
man, which are carried on in different
parts of the country In co-operation with
the colleges, experiment stations and
benevolent Organizations. A large amount
of information regarding the food habits
of our people, cost of food as related to
its nutritive value, the effects of cooking
on the digestibility of food. etc.. has been
collected. A special effort has, been made
to bring the results of this work to the
attention of school officers and .women's
organizations interested in the mainten
ance of courses of instruction in cooking
and other branches of domestic science.
The publications of the department on
this subject are now in use In many col
leges and schools throughout the country
The fruits of this work have also been
utilized for the improvement of the ra

Inmates of public Institutions. ; . â¢ â¢

The divisions of sorts and vegetable ph-Â»
thePn^ d^Â° lnsy ln co-operaUon with
r^J^? nnecticut experiment station have
recently been making, experiments in the
growing an d curing of tobacco, which in
dicate that the much-prized Sumatra to
bacco can be successfully grown ln that
State. This is likely to result in k com
plete revolution in the tobacco Industry
of the Connecticut Valley, and in the end
may greatly cheapen the cost of such to
bacco to consumers.
The division of forestry is giving very
valuable advice and assistance Jn handling
forest lands in different parts of the coun
trv and in promoting the planting of tree3
In the vast prairie and plain regions of
the United States.
The department Is also making an ac
tive propaganda in favor of Improved
roads. This work is as much in the inter
est t)t commerce as of agriculture, and
benefits all who use the roads for pleas
ure as well as for business. It is, there
fore receiving: the support of all sorts of
people and organizations. The organized
good-roads people, representing thirty
eight States, resolved at their late meet
ing at Chicago that $130,000 should be ap
propriated to enlarge the work so that
sample roads could be constructed in each
State and Territory.
Fostering Our Export Trade.
The statistical work of the department.
which alms to secure and disseminate ac
curate information regarding our agricul
tural products and the foreign markets for
tnese products, affects vast commercial
interests fully as much as it does those
of the people on our farms. It ia estimat
ed that the agricultural products of this
country in a single year have an aggre
gate value of at least $3,000,000,000. The
agricultural exports of the United States
now annually exceed ISOO.or/1,000 in value.
This enormous trade reaches 4o all quar
ters of the globe. These figures give some
idea of the vastness of our agricultural
Interests and show why it la that all
branches of business prosper In this cotin
trv when the farmers are prosperous.
The~ are also a measure of the value of
a properly conducted Department of Agri
culture to the people of the United States.
That this department Is now the greatest
and most efficient agency of its kind in the
world was the general verdict of the ex
perts who examined its work at the Paris
exposition last summer.

In the collection of their unpaid salaries
for November and December, 1S9S. These
claims are to be paid out of the surplus
fund, which the Auditor estimates will
amount to $220,000 at the end of 'the fiscal
year. Wells declares that the. collection
of the claims should not cost the teachers
one cent except perhaps for some clerical
labor required to make a proper presenta
tion of the demands. - These are all regis
tered in the Auditor's office, and Wells
Insists that the teachers shall have pref

far from her residence, began to pay her
marked . attention. She was puzzled by
his demwnor till Thursday night, when
he asked her to take a walk -with' hint.
They left her home and had gone about
two hundred yards when he suddenly
snatched her purse from her hand. It
contained $8 20 and two keys. Just then
a strang-er passed them and King- trans
ferred the purse to hjm. She accused
King of stealing her purse, but he said
she rnuFt be crazy and must, have dropped
It. They argued the point for about two
hours and then she went home. After sha
grot home she says the young man to
whom King handed the purse called upon
her and acknowledged that it was a plot
on King's part to rob her. King got the
purse from him. he said.

while at work at the "company 'm yards at

A train of freipht tars was being made
u;> at about &:3<' ]â¢â¢ m. in the vicinity of
the accident. Balpb Anderson, who was
to go out as conductor of the train, saw
a lantern fall somÂ« distance from him and
he signaled to the engineer to stop. Hur

horrified to > r Martin's form under the
wheels. TbÂ« tody was i.-ichtfully man

How the accident haptx-rod no one
could explain. The d^ad man's lantern
in found twenty feet frr.in where the
1 ndy lay. Â»"tillÂ« his hammer and wrench
wore etaoe dirtunce farther away.

Besides these there will be committee?
6n public services, oress and postofflce,
transportation and information.
The prospects are good for a large at
tendance in October. A rate of $50 (first
class) has been granted by the transpor
tation companies and many, it is expected,
will take advantage of the offer and visit
the far West.
There are fifty-nine dioceses, each of
which has four clerical and the same num
ber of lay delegates, besides seventeen
missionary jurisdictions having two rep
resentatives each. In addition there are
ninety-one bishops, with coadjutors, in
all numbering 597 delegates. In addition
the national organizations of the Wo
man's Auxiliary and the Daughters of 1
the King, with hundreds of delegates,
meet at the time of the general election.
It has not yet. been decided in which
church ihe , convention is to be held,
though, in all probability. Trinity will bo
chosen as the larsest and mest conveni
ently situated.
Members of the Episcopalian denomina
tion in all parts of the State are actively
â¢engaged in preparing for their triennial
convention, . which ' meets in this" city in
October of the present year. Some, among
the ultra conservative delegations of the
East, made an attemut to have the con
vention transferred to an Eastern city,
urging the. great distance and the time re
quired to attend, but the almost unani
mous voice of the church demanded that
for once the convention should be held in
the far West in order that ocular evidence
of the errow.th and condition of the west
ern dioceses should be had.
While >,the dioceses of Sacramento and
Los Anseles a're- to co-operate with San
Francisco in making provisions for re-"
celving the. great gathering of the wholo
church, the burden necessarily falls upon
the parent diocese, and largely upon the
see city of the diocese, for the past two
weeks Bishop 'Nichols, assisted by the
standing committee of the diocese, has
been engaged in selecting the several
committees which will have entire charge
of arrangements for the convention. TJio

The Most Important Period in a
Woman's Existence. â Mrs. John-
son Tells How She Was Helped
Over the Trying Time.
Owing to modern methods of living, not one womsin in a thousand a]>
1 proaches this perfectly natural change without experiencing a train of very
annoying, and sometimes painful symptoms.
. Those dreadful hot flashes, sending the blood surging to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, sometimes with chills,
as if the heart were going to stop for good, are only a few of the symptoms of
a dangerous nervous trouble. The nerves are crying out for assistance. The
cry should bo heeded in time. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was
prepared to meet the needs of woman's system at this trying period of her life.
The three following letters are guaranteed to be genuine and true, and
still further prove what a great medicine Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is for women.
Mar. 12, 1397.
" Dear Mrs. Pixkiiam : â I have been sick for a long time. I was taken
sick with flooding. All my trouble seemed to be in the womb. I ache all the
time at the lower part of the womb. The doctor says the womb is covered
with ulcers. I suffer with a pain on the left side of my back over the kidney.
I am fifty years old and passing through the ohange oflife. Please advise me
what to do to get relief. Would like to hear from you as soon as possible."â
Mp.3. Charlotte Joicjson, Monclova. Ohio.
Jan. 23, 1S9S.
" I have been taking your remedies, and think they have helped me a great
deal. I had been in bed for ten weeks when I began taking your Vegetable
Compound, but after using it for a short time I was able to be up around the
house. The aching in the lower part of womb has left me. The most that
troubles me now is the flowing. That is not so bad, but still there is a little
every day. I am not discouraged yet, and shall continue with your medicine,
for I believe it will cure me." â Mrs. Charlotte Johnson, Monclova.Ohio.
April 13, 1900.
" I send you this letter to publish for the benefit of others. I was sick for
about nine years so that I could not do my work. J For three months I could
not sit up long enough to hu.ve my bed made. I had five different doctors, and
all said there was no help fv">r me. My trouble was change of life. I suffered
with ulccration or the womb, pain in sides, kidney and stomach trouble, back-
ache, headache, and dizziness. I am well and strong, and feel like a new
person. My recovery is a perfect surprise to everybody that knew me. I owe
all to Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I would not do without
your medicine for anything. There is no need of women suffering so much if
they would take your remedies, for they are a sure cure." â Mrs. CnABLOTTB
JOHN8O3J, Monclova, Ohio.
When one stops to think about the good Mrs. Johnson derived from Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine, it seems almost beyond belief; yet it is all
true as stated in her three letters published above at her own request.
As a matter, of positive fact Mrs. Pinkham has. on file .thousands of
letters from women who have been safely carried through that danger period
"Change of Life." Mrs. Johnson's cure is not an unusual one for Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine to accomplish. . â¢* .

After a brief argument by his attorney,

court had the power to admit the prisoner
to bail, and the reading of two affidavits
of physicians regarding Carter's health.
Judge Hook handed down his decision. lie

the. court-martial was final unless set
aside by the Supreme Court of the United
States.
"I cannot," said Judge Hook in closing.
"even had the court the power, which is
doubtful, see a reason ' for liberating the
prisoner on bail. Such a cÂ«se has not been
presented that would authorize anything
of the kind, and the motion is denied and
the Judgment of the. court-martial

spoken, but soon regained his composure,

The liabilities are estimated at about $6000,
Â¦while tho assets are placed at less than
$500. The suspension was caused by the
California National Bank refusing to car
ry $400 worth of checks, which were issued
to small creditors last Friday. The bank
is pecured for all amounts advanced by
bills of lading of all recent shipments,
with drafts attached, and the only credi
tors are fruit erowers.

CALL BUREAU. H0Â« G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â Tho promo
tion of Naval Constructor R. P. Hobson
from number fifteen to number five. If
approved by the Senate, will, after all, be
only an empty honor to the recipient, as
he will simply gain the title of captain,
but receive no increase of his present sal
ary. There are nineteen naval construc
tors, five of whom have the rank of cap
tain, five rank with commanders and the
remainder with lieutenants. The pay of
these officers Is not regulated by the rank
they hold, but is based solely upon their
length of service. Mr. Hobson's present
pay is that of a naval constructor during
his first live years after date of commis
sion, and amounts to $3200.' which will be"
increased to $3400 on and after June 28,
11*03, and so on in five-year periods until
he has seen twenty years' service on the
list of naval constructors, when the max
imum pay of $4a*) is reached.
The present chlet constructor will retire
on March 4, causing a general promotion
along the line. Constructor Bowles, the
builder of the Texas, is slated for the
chief constructorship, making Hanscom
tho senior constructor, followed by Lln
nard. Hobson, Woodward and Taylor. The
queer thing about this promotion is that
while those ranking with Hobson receive
tMO more salary there are five In tho grade
below who draw $200 more pay than the
hero of the Merrimac is entitled to, unless
the Senate makes special provision for an
adequate increase.
Mr. Hobson's promotion to captain's
rank does not bring him any nearer to the
coveted and responsible position -of chief
constructor, for the selection of that of
ficial may be made from the list of those
who rank with commanders, and four
years hence the son-in-law of "Coal Oil"
Paine and the son of the head of thÂ© Mor
mon church would stand an equal chance
with Hobson in the race for the chief con
structorship of the United States navy.

The Rummage sale for the benefit of
the Infant Shelter did a land-offlce busi
ness yesterday afternoon â¢ and evening.
The store In which the sale Is being held,
at the corner of Seventh , and Minna
streets, was crowded all day, and all of
the many poor visitors carried away large
bundles of clothes, shoes, etc., purchased
for a mere song. The ladies who have the
sale in charge have but one thing to cOm â¢
plain ofâ the lack of clothing to dispose
of. Especially Is there a demand for chil
dren's clothes, which cannot be supplied.
An earnest request is made for clothes
of all descriptions. A telephone call cr
postal addressed to any of the ladles of
the shelter will receive immediate atten
tion and they will be pleased to send for
the clothes and have them brought to the
sale.
The salo closes to-morrow evening, but
should the ladies have their, expectations
realized in the way of adde4 donations,
the sale will be reopened on Thursday.
Ladies of Infant Shelter Expect to
' Do Business Again Next ,

Rabbi Nleto delivered an interesting ser
mon on modern reform 1 In worship at th<Â»
Post and Taylor street syriagt>iju-Â« last
evening. He argued that In the words of
the poet, the man who thinks does not
worship and pray and the man who wor
ships and prays does not . think. . Th j
speaker claimed that the modern mode of
reform 'worship retaln'ed many form9 of
ancient rites which were not consistent
with reform. The first reformers had re
tained many old customs in order to make
the religion attractive and the successors
to the reformers still kept these old cus
toms in the belief that they were part of
the reform religion.
, "It Is not necessary," said Rabbi Nleto,
"to pay for prayers for the. souls of th*Â»
dead. God needs no bribe to take care
of the souls." Rabbi Nleto that
the reform religion of all churches would
be a religion which the . thinking people
would want. A reform religion could not
be a true reform, one while It retained
many of the modes and customs in vogue
In pagan days.

The pageantry was but a symbolism of
royalty. . The gorgeous atage production*
of Shakespeare's plays to-day would as

Yet, the lavish, productions were but tho

Shakespeare. That thought existed. when
the plays were produced in the days of
Elizabeth.. Then, as now, . the beauties
of Shakespeare are in the depth of
thought. The stage pictures are but ex
ternal attributes. Too often civilization

"It is a Question to decide," said Rabbi

Unanimous Action Taken at Meeting
Called by Harbor Commissioners
to Consider This Very Im
portant Issue.
A meeting of representative members of
the commercial bodies of the city was
held yesterday afternoon with 'the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners, at the
Invitation of the latter, the purpose be
ing to confer relative to the' legislation
pending at Sacramento concerning the
lease of China Basin to the San Joaquln
Valley Railroad. The business men left
no chance for a doubt before the confer
ence closed as to their wishes. A resolu
tion offered by Secretary Scott of the
Chamber of Commerce was unanimously!
adopted, authorizing the appointment of
a committee to confer with the legisla
tors. The committee was instructed to
recommend favorable action. The text of
the resolution follows:
Resolved. That a committee of business men
of this city be appointed . to confer with the
Governor and members of the Legislature and
recommend to them favorable consideration and
action" upon . the legislation - now pending for
the ratification of the lease of the China Basin
to the San Joaquln Valley Railroad by the
State' Board of Harbor Commissioners.
The following were recommended as the
committee:
George A.'Xewhall, K. W. Dohrmann, "Wake
field Baker. A. A. Watklns, A. Chesebrough,
H. D, Loveland, John Herminitham, C. Minor

ser, A. I* Bcotti W. H. Rouesell. Isaac Upham,
A. Sbarboro. F. W. Van Slcklen, Irving M.

This committee will meet Sunday morn
ing in the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce and. will go to Sacramento Mon
day, 4 as the bill will be reported on that
day by the committee having it under
consideration.
Several business men spoke," all being
strongly In favor of the legislation. At
the outset President Kilburn of the Har
bor Commission explained the reason for
assembling representatives of all the com
mercial organizations of the city. The
legislative Committee on Commerce and
Navigation came to San Francisco a week
ago and visited the China Basin. Last
Tuesday the Harbor Commission went to
Sacramento and conferred with the legis
lative committee at the State Capitol.
While the legislative committee offered no
serious objection to the bill, there was a
tendency to delay action. The session of
the Legislature was near an end. The
Harbor Commission had judged It to be
for the public good to Invite the business
men to meet and take some steps to im
press on the j Legislature that they were
united and earnest in the matter. The
commission believed the people of the
State to be much interested.
E. S. Pillsbury and' Captain Payson
spoke briefly. The substance of their re
marks was that the le^se of. the basin
does not depend upon the Legislature. If
the lease is not ratified the railway com
pany would save $250,000. which it would
nave to expend in building the seawall.
But just as soon as the lease was rati
fied the company would begin 'the work
on the seawall and the company stood
ready to carry out all parts of its agree
ment. The State was much more inter
ested than the railway company. All the
board ought to be required to do was to
state to the Legislature that action was
necessary for the good of the State, to se
cure such action.
Commissioners Herol<J.and Harney add
ed that they thought that it. was very
advisable that the business men should
express themselves so that the Legisla
ture would understand their attitude to be
strongly In favor of the legislation.
Irving M. Scott said that it was un
questionably the wish of the people of San
Francisco that the bill should be passed.
A. Chesebrough, â¢ Captain Birmingham,
General Clunle, ex-Governor Budd and H.
D. Loveland also spoke. Mr, Loveland
spoke of "San Francisco's ' grand old
man," Claus Spreckels, without whose ac
tion San Francisco would still be with
only one transcontinental railway.

Six-Day Run to Chicago and

Asked For. .
Committee Presents' Memorial to
Southern Pacific, Union Pacific
and Santa Fe BatlroadLs lor
Their Consideration,
X committee chosen by the representa
tive fruit growers of the State filed a
memorial with the Southern Pacific.
Union Pacifia and Santa Fe railroad
companies yesterday. In which It Is re-
Quested that the carrying of green decid
uous fruits to Eastern markets shall not
In future tales longer than elz days to
Chicago and eight days to New York.
In thÂ« preamble the committee does not
request a reduction In either freight or
rÂ«frlgeratlng chars** B-t this time, al
though It cJalnis that the fruit growers
ere greatly handicapped by the transpor
tation charges in comparison with similar
charges asrair.st citrus fruits.
la the memorial the committee claims
that If a elx and eight day eerrtce bÂ«
given as asked for. It will greatly aid
the distribution of the growers' product.
The fruit men claim that th* rruit then ,
icm arrive at Its destination In a more
perfect condition, which will permit cf Its
bÂ«ng reshipped to other localities from
two hundred to five hundred miles distant.
This result would not only multiply and
broaden California markets, but will also
give millions of people an opportunity to
become consumers of our fruit who be
fore saw but little if any of it and con
sequently know nothing- of its superior
Quality.
The memorial also Etates that many
cars of fruit that were sold to outside
Eastern points were rejected simply on
account of being over-ripe. The fruit that j
brings the best return? for the growers |
and shippers of California is that which
arrives in such condition as to allow of
its being rehandled or re?hipj>Â»d from the
distributing points In the Exist. At pres
ent, because of the> long and Indefinite
time consumed in tranFportat.cn, the ruie
is to pack the fruit as pror-n as p<i??ibl<>,
and much of it arrives a: it? domination

"It may Interest you to know that we

others when we firÂ«t began to prepare
Postum. AVe boiled it !n a desultory sort
of way for a few minutes and the pro-
duct was not satisfactory-' Turning to
the directions we discovered . the fault
and from that time we have followed
those directions, which are simple enough,
with the ir.ost satisfactory results in point
of flavor and food value.
"With my best wishes for your contin-
ued success." Dr. A. G. Alston.
"Coffee is ruining and destroying thou-
sands of our young Americans, and It is a
pleasure to know of a nutritious and pal-
atable breakfast beverage that rebuild*
the nervous Â«-ystem rather than tears it
down, as the old coffee does.

Coffee was a complete Eurprise. I began

NO N1BBLER.
It can be truthfully said of no
remedy in the world what is so often said
of Palne's celery compound, that In no
single Instance has it failed to benefit,
and benefit permanently â and there's the
point that no sufferer should lose sight of.
The whole stock-in-trade of the ordi-
nary, plausible-sounding, but wholly Ir-
responsible remedies Is to bring about the
appearance of health, to cover up symp-
toms and to stave off break downs,
making the permanent cure all the more
difficult.
Other remedies, because they can ef-
fect no lasting cure-, do harm. .
The same, words that fairly and ac-
curately describe Paine's celery com-
pound, a remedy that every day proves
its worth, are boldly used to exploit con-
coctions that can by.no possibility do any-
thing but harm.- . More brains and inge-
nuity is expended on the label and wrap-
per than. on what is put into the. bottles.
Persons who try this remedy and that. In
the foolish hope that they may hit 'on the
right one by chance, and at any rate
It can do them no harm, should know that
they are doing their system Incalculable
mischief and putting off the day of com-
plete recovery by such experimenting.
Paine's celery compound must not be
judged by the standard of any of these
superficial medicines. It Is a great, re-
sponsible, scientific discovery, slnguarly
unlike any remedial agent that ever aimed
to effect a similar purposeâ to make peo-
ple, well. It Is not an ordinary remedy.
The 1 results from ita use have been so
extraordinary and so gratifying that busy
men and women have gone out of their
way to send letters' of thanks and to allow
their names to vouch for every statement,
they have made In praise of It.-
The following acknowledgment from
Mrs. Geo. F. Rouse of Green Bay, Wls..
of the surprising* benefit she has received
from the use of Paine's celery compound
Is too valuable to be withheld from the
public.' Mrs. Rouse's honest opinion oi
this great remedy cannot be mistaken by
any one who reads her letter.
Green Bay, Wls.,

"Wells, Richardson & Co.,
Gentlemen;â For the past ten years I
have been troubled with neuralgia of tha
stomach and dizziness In the head. I have
doctored with many -doctors, but found no
relief until a friend' of mine recommended
to me your Palne's celery compound, and
I found it a great cure for my sickness.
Yours very truly.
Mrs. Geo. K. Rouse.
Public opinion In the large cities
throughout the country shows the reli-
ance that hard- worked, often over-
worked, men and ' women have come to
place upon Palne's celery compound.
Nothing demoralizes the health sooner
or more completely than even the. occa-
sional loss of sleep. Palne's celery com-
pound gets the brain out of this danger-
ous habit of sleeplessness. It feeds tho
nervous tissues all over the body, and
does not let the nutrition of these delicate
parts get low enough to permit of insom-
nia. One of the earliest evidences of tha
final success of this jrreat nerve and brain
Invlgorator in curing: neuralgia, debility.
rheumatism, headaches and indigestion
due to Insufficient nerve force, Is the Joy-
ous feeling of returning strength of mind
and body, cheerfulness and "well being"
that takes the place of the old, tired, lan-
guid, morbid, melancholy condition.
*If you are "played out," to use a forci-
ble street phrase, can't digest, can't sleep.
can't work, and have lost courage. It Is
your nervous system that Is "played out."
Try Palne's celery compound and see how
soon you give up brooding over your
health and how soon you forget you ever
had nerves that could possibly ache. The
dismal failures of other remedies must
not prevent one from taking the re'medy
that Is always successful. Palne's celery
compound has driven sickness from thou-
sands of homes. '

CHICAGO, Feb. 15.â Corn was the largest
market experienced lately. Buying was gen
eral, while most of the offerings came from
local hands. At the bottom of the market's
strength lay light country acceptances, belief
In an approaching period of bad roads, which
would hinder the movsment. the small amount
of contract stocks here and the fact that cash
sales here yesterday afternoon aggregated half
a million bushels. May corn opened 4c higher
at 40U@40%c and under heavy buying for both
accounts advanced during the .forenoon to 40%c.
On the rise local traders offered liberally and
the market reacted slowly to 40%c. The close,
however, was strong,' U@%c higher, at 404c.
w heat was dull and narrow. Trade In this
cereal was light in .volume and absolutely bare
ot speculative featu.v*. Cables were steaely
and Argentine shipments less than they were
the previous week. The*V facts, combined with
the corn strength, merely saved . the bearish
sentiment of the crowd . from becoming suf
ficiently confident to result In short selling.
May opened He higher at 75%@75%c and de
clined early to 754c. After touching 75%c the
market rallied feebly to 7.-)4<375Hc and the
close was steady, a shade lower, at 734c.
inere was a moderately active market for
oats, but the, range waa a narrow one. May
closed a shade down at 2a%@254c.
r revisions were dull and the tendency easier
because of heavy . hog receipts. Commlsslon
nouses which bought yesterday were generally
skiers to-day and in this they were Joined In
a Hmall way by a packing Interest. The close
was easy. May pork closed 124c lower, lard
and ribs 5c lower. Â¦ Â¦ -

NEW TORK. Feb. 15.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
Divers influences were apparent In the ac
tion of speculation this week. In spite of the
strong tone which was manifested early In
the week there were also indications of a dls
l-osttlon to take profits in the railroad share
list, based on the belief that the Immediate
developments In connection with the impor
tant combinations of properties had exhausted
their effect. There wes a slackening of the
tendency to buy railroad shares and the con
cessions In prices apparently encouraged bear
ish operators to attack prices, which they did
on Wednesday with some temporary success
On the other hand the idea that the arrange^
mtnts for the purchase of the majority in
terest In the Carnegie Steel Company and Its
probable sequel In the form of a new and
larger combination, of steel interests than has
yet been seen were progressing favorably held
tip the . principal Industrial stocks and kept
'the street waiting for some announcement in
ttis connection. On Thursday, when prices
in the railroad department seemed liable to
settle down still further, the market as a
whole was again stimulated by reports that
the news of a rearrangement In tbe steel In
dustry might be brought about at any moment
It was further agreed that the large financial
interests which are financing the steel deal
would be likely to prevent any serious break
in prices pending the consummation of their
r-Ians, and this idea seemed to find support
In the strength of the coal stocks and other
securities with which these Interests are iden
tified. There were no other factors of gen
eral importance to materially affect the mhr
ket at large. Reports of new combinations in
the railroad world were circulated, but did
rot gain the same credence as during the
preceding fortnight.

THE STOCK MARKET.
WHEAT â There was no pronounced change
In the Eastej-n and foreign markets. Argentine
shipments for the week were 1.376,000 bushels,
against 1,624,000 for the corresponding week
last year. Since January 1 these shipments
foot up 4.556.O0O bushels, against 6,064,000 for
the same time last year. India reported some
damage by storms In the upper and central
provinces, with Mistress Increasing in Bom
bay. The recent advance at Paris was due to
the agitation for bounties by farmers and re
ported damage to the French crop' by severe
frosts, though It Is too early yet for a definite
opinion on the latter point.
! Chicago opened firm, but dull at the closing
prices of. the preceding day. Millers reported
an improvement in the demand for Flour.

Xczi' York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.-Priccs In stocks made
a pood recover}' in the latter part of to-day's
trading under the aggressive leadership of
Burlington. New York Central and Delaware
and Hudson. As a result the majority of
flocks show net gains, but most of these are
Email. During the greater part of the day
the market was distinctly reactionary and
drifted downward whenever considerate offer
ings came on the market. The E;>ots of
etrengtn here and there among the more ob
ecure stocks did not sustain prices in the
general list. London's buying of Americans
served only as a temporary prop, although
the opening advances txtended to about a pjint
in several of the international stocks. A fur
thÂ»T violent break In the smelting stocks,
which carried the common down 2\ and the
preferred 2 was the first development to se
riously undermine the market. T!*s metal
stocks were all affected In sympathy and the
laFscs in the eteel stocks ran up to 2 points.
New York Central was one of the early points
of strength and Delaware and Hudson was
fclso firm throughout, but the market did not
respond to these ur.tll supplemented by the
late movement in the grangers. The absorp
tion of tturlington was very heavy and it was
carried up by rapid stages 614 points from the
lowest, establishing a r.et gain of 4\i. There
was no news to explain the spurt in this
ftock. but it was supposed to be concerned
with developments looking to a trans-conti
nental outlet for Burlington. The Grangers
Improved about 2 points or better in sympa
thy. There were strong recoveries in Brook
lyn Transit ar.d Susar. which, however, Iert
them only small net gain*, owing to their
early weakness. The general list was at one
time a point or more below last night's level
for the principal active stocks. The late rally
was not -by any means universal, but- mar.v
rrorr.lnent stocks were lifted from their early
depresslon. New York Central's rise of Z%
end Delaware and Hudson of 10 r-otnts appar
ently had some connection, although what it
was not disclosed.
Among the notable movements of usuallj*
cbsrure stocks may be mentioned a rise of 10
points in American Kxpress, 7Â»4 In Evansville
end Tcrre Haute, 4 for the preferred. S for the
North American stock and 2 1 ; for the old 4
for Texas and Pacific Land Trust. 6 for Gen
eral Electric, with a reaction of SH: 3>i for
M heeling and Lake Erie eecond preferred and
5 for Pullman ar.d Minneapolis and Bt. Louis
thÂ« latter reacting 2. Apparently tlie suspense
of the continued negotiations of the eteel
rnerger and uneasiness over the 'money out
look were the influential factors in repressing
â¢ ctlvlty. A decline In the call money rate to
1% per cent at the close had something to d/>
Â«-ltn the final rally. The ease of money belled
the forecast of the bank statement, which In
dicates a weak return, but with large receipts
of customs and the payment of nearly J3.000.000
on account of a Central Pacific note, the sub-
Treasun- has taken from the banks thus far
this week J3 350.000. in spite of the high level
or pension disbursements reached during the
â¢week. The banks have continued to receive
currency from the interior, partly in the shape
gold from Kan Francisco by registered mail
,. amount ! * estimated at over $2,000,000. It
will *Â«Â« seen that this indicates a cash loss of
between Jl.OOO.OOO and t2.000.ooo. *The loan
Item, however. Is of. principal Interest. There
have been additional Urge demands for rall
rond finances during the week and the general
*urpo*ltlon is that a pavment of somethlmr
like JK.OOO.OOO has been made to Mr earned
on the Â«Â«?1 deal, which will figure in the loan
itf*TO.
The rrtttnne* of the money market this after
noon may be the prelude to a surprise In
to-morrow's bank statement.

London Market.
, NEW YORK. Feb. 15.-ThÂ» Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: .
The stoct market here was heavy at the
openrnc to-day, but. firm at th* close. The
strensth was attributed to the growl n jr. im
pression that the end of the war in South
Africa Is near. General fdtchener's character
istic silence when In touch with the enemy
belnz read as significant. Investment buying
waÂ« inspired by this idea and also by the good
American shares were much quieter) but
bard and scarce. On the curb after the close
NEW YORK. Feb. 15. -R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of, trade to-morrow will say:
Business continues of good volume in nearly
all parts of the country and reports from the
West and Southwest of a satisfactory dis
tribution of merchandise by jobbers begin to
have, a familiar sound. Heavy orders come
from" agents on the road. There is no Import
ant- change in prices in any department of
manufactured goods and some staples rise
while others decline, but the longer the situa
tion remains as at present, the surer the busi
ness world feels about a rise In prices in the
future, for the demand for merchandise for
prompt consumption does not decrease. Some
progress has been made in the direction of
settlement of labor differences in the Far
West and the temper of eof t coal miners j is
more amicable, while there is little concern
among steel Interests over the sensational stor
ies of organization at the mills to enforce de
mands for higher wages.
The standard measures of business make
favorable comparisons. At some points there
are evidences of an inclination'- to delay oper
ations in iron and steel until something definite
is known regarding the proposed combination,
but this applies only to small undertakings
which are insignificant in comparison with the
urgent dealings that cannot be postponed. Fur
chasers lind difficulty In securing even ap
proximate dates for delivery of goods in many
products and mills are bo far behind orders,
as a rule that no new contracts are sought.
Structural materials and railway supplies are
in greatest request, numerous heavy orders
bting accepted this week at full prices. There
is no Inclination to shade Quotations of finished
products, and ' pigiron at iMttsburg haa been
again advanced.
No sign of weakness Is apparent In any de
partment of the boot and ehoe industry. Some
manufacturers have booked orders that will
Insure running on full time well Into May,
and It Is an exceptional case where Jobbers can
necuie March delivery even from the smaller
and South with moFt cheeriul reports, an.l
while local jobbing Is l.-ss brisk than lat-t
week, there is no complaint. Forwardlngs from
IJoston were 67,437 cases, against &3,2o5 cases
in the previous week, and although the total
for two weeks is somewhat smaller than the
1S5.C6S cases shipped last year, the movement
In 19C0 was heavier than In the corresponding
fortnight of any other ye.ir.
News retarding the textile manufactures is
less encouraging, despite the face that sales
of wool at the three chief Eastern markets
rose to 6,7Â»2.C00 pounds, far exceeding all recent
records and showing a gain of S60.600 poumis
o\er the same week last year. It was at this
time in 19C0 that the movement commenced
to fall off and the depression began which has
continued ever since.
Ccttcn fabrics continue Quiet and domestic
mills are not fully oecupieO. Liverpool cables
have Riven n o support, while Manchester Is
fiecurlr.g raw cotton from Indl^ In unusually
large quantities. # TheÂ«e Influences caused a
further dpcllne in middling uplands, taking the
price to the lowest point in three months. Ex
ports in January were valued at J3.i.S37.9.H.
against $27.0S9,251 in 1900, but the Increase was
entirely clue to an advance of 2.2 cents a pqund
In the price, as the quantity was 1S42 bales
smaller.
Wheat was advanced this week by reports
of receipts at the mills unfit for grinding. The
flour output at Minneapolis is much smaller
thpn a year ago, and a further decrease is ex
pected. Atlantic exports of wlieat. Including
flour, for the week were 2,478,521 bushels,
against '1,329,633 bushels last year.
Failures for thp week numbered 257 In the
United States, against 21S last year, and in
Canada 40, against 42 last year.
Silver a fraction firmer again. Exchange as before.
Mackerel in barrels advanced 50c.
Hogs scarce and still higher. Other Meats unchanged.

the total business waa of small volume. First
'sales were made at $26 77 >4 and finally at

of 25s at London to Â£122 17s 6d for spot and

Oakland O*fnce San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Feb. 15.
Congressman S. D. Woods of Stockton,
who is a new member of the House of
Representatives, appeared before a joint
meeting of the Oakland. Board of Trade
and Merchants' Exchange to-day to dis
cuss the reception of the Committee on
Rivers and Harbors of- the House of Rep
resentatives, which will visit this .coast
next s"prlng. He told the Oaklanders that
the only way to get anything was to send
Representatives back year after year.
The object of the visit wa? to Induce
the Oaklanders to invite the House Com
mittee on Rivers and Harbors to visit
Oakland harbor when the committee came
to California this spring, and in support
of his request Mr.. Woods said:
As the Committee on Rivers and Harbors
hns ro very intimate knowledge of the needs
of Oakland harbor, I would advise that they
be especially invited to Oakland to view the
work here. I nnderstand that the committee
will accept the invitation If extended.
Burton has been sent back to Congress year
In and .year out until he has rtsen to the posi
tion of chairman of one of the most important
committees In the House. He wtelds such in
fluence that he has been able .to secure $3,000.
000 this session for his city of Cleveland. Con
cresx la controlled by about twenty men. and
none of those have been in the 'House less
than twelve years. California is lookPd to as
the leading Pacific Coast State, and If It can
only eend Its Congressmen back often enough
to secure some influence It can rival the larger
Eastern States.
This precipitated some little expression
of opinion upon this point, the members
agreeing unanimously with the Congress
man.. A .formal invitation was extended
to the committee and will be sent bjÂ» the
officers of the two organizations.

The Municipal League will hold the first
meeting of Its campaign at Masonic Hall
on Saturday evening. Arrangements have
been made for a large crowd, and a band
will keep the audience amused when the
speakers are not employed. J. W. Nelson,
former City Councilman, will be the pres
ident of the evening and will make an
address upon the campaign issues. Judge
J. M. Haven of the Fifth Ward, H. A.
Powell of the Fourth Ward, both well
known citizens, and A. Bradford Web
fcter, a young man who has achieved some
reputation as an orator, will speak upon
the general issues of the campaign. In
addition to these gentlemen, the candi
datesjof the party will be present and
each will make a short address. Walter
G. Manuel will make his first public utter
ances during the campaign, and will out
line his policy to the voters of' the city.
W. A. Dow, M. K. Miller and other: can
didates will say a few words each.
The Municipal League held a meeting
last evening at the residence of Council
man B. C. Cuvellier, who is a candidate
for re-election at large. There was a
large crowd for a house meeting and the
various candidates upon the Municipal
League ticket made short addresses. Wal
ter G. Manuel, candidnte for Mayor, de
clared that the municipal ownership of
water works was the paramount issue in
the present campaign, and that the peo
ple of Oakland could not afford to pay
water rates upon a valuation of $8,600,000,
that the Contra Costa Water Company
claimed. â¢ The only remedy, he asserted,
was for the city to own Its water supply.
W. A. Dow, candidate for City Attorney,
said that the Contra Costa Water Com
pany wan carrying on its litigation as it
began itâ by burning its books. He urgÂ»d
harmony in municipal affairs by the elec
tion of tho Municipal League ticket. M.
K. Miller quoted figures to show that wat
er rates were higher in Oakland than' else
where. There were speeches by A. H.
Breed, J. D. Galloway, C. H. Daly, B. C.
Cuvellier. Felton Taylor, G. T. Burtchaell,

CINCINNATI. Feb. X3.â The JeffriwÂ»-
Ruhlin contest, scheduled for to-night,
was declared off Judicially yesterday and
officially to-day.
Judge Hollister to-day Indorsed the en
try of the decree forbidding the contest.
A significant feature of Judge* Hollister's
decision la that the Saengerfest Athletic
Club la enjoined also from accepting here
after from the Mayor any permit for spar
ring . matches, a glove contest or prize
fight. The entry is made so sweeping as
to apply to all such events in Hamilton
County and other places In Ohio. Jeffries
is billed to appear at Columbus to-morrow
night and Ruhlln at Marietta, Ohio. It
was announced to-day that Governor
Nash not only intends to stop boxing con
tests in Ohio but also intends to investi
gate these sparring exhibitions. They will
both keep .their engagements and no
trouble is fefcred, for they simply give an
exhibition of sparring.
Instead of an Influx of visitors to wit
ness a championship contest to-day thero
has teen a general "breakaway." .
About $50,000. taken in for tickets will bo
refunded on the presentation of tickets.
After a joint meeting of the Saengerfest
Athletic Association directors and of thÂ©
fighters the $10, two forfeit thl3 afternoon
was turned over to Brady and Madden.
They had each deposited I250O of this
amount and received the same back in
equal amounts. Of the $3ow) forfeit de
posited for the Saengerfest Athletic As
sociation Brady received J375O and Madden
only $1250. This was due to the fact that
Brady had borne all expenses except those
at the training quarters of Ruhjin. .Brady
was the manager for the Saengerfest Ath
letic Association as well aa for Jeffries.
Manager Brady later, on behalf of him
self and the pugilists, expressed their en
tire approval of the course of the directors
of the Saengerfest Association and their
regret that the undertaking had met with
failure. Mr. Brady. offered further to con
duct an entertainment; at any time during
the. coming week for the benefit of tho
Saengerfest Athletic Association and on
behalf of himself and Jeffries. The asso
.elation formally accepted the proposition
and announced there would be an auction,
of seats for tho performance early next
week.

telegraphed Brady an offer for the Jef
frie-3-Ruhlin tight, saying that the men
could fight under the same conditions that
were to govern the contest in Cincinnati.
There were, in fact, other propositions,
but the managers of both Jeffries and
Ruhlin denied the acceptance of any of
them up to the time of their departure
to-night. Â¦ â¢ .
Manager Brady said that he would not
accept any proposition for Jeffries to-en
gage in airy contests in the future until
there was a legal as well aa a financial
guarantee.
"We will go ahead with our theatrical
venture for the present," said Brady,
"and will pay no attention to any propo
sitions for Jeffries to meet Ruhlln or any
other man. Our expt- rience here ha3 been
a warning- to us, and 1. for one, do not
care to go through the worry and loss
that this match has occasioned me. In
regard to the Denver offer I will say that
the only condition under which we will go
to Denver is for Mr. Floio to offer a purse
of $25,C0O. the money to be deposited in a
bank before the contest and to be for
feited in case the contest is prevented by
legal measures."

I saw Miss Knutzen, although I had
often heard Mrs. McChesney speak of her.
She said- that they expected to take a

"When Mrs. McChesney first came hers
she told me that Miss Knutzen wanted to
marry a Mr. Golden, but her family ob

that all their plans, that Is. the plans
of Mrs. McChesney and Miss Knutzen for
a trip, had been broken into. .
"Mrs. McChesn^y had about J1C0, and
I am afraid she has gone away to stay:

PEHAL SERVITUDE
OAKLAND. Feb. 15.-Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Knutzen, and incidentally
some of the guests In the Hotel
â¢Raymond in this city, have been
trying all day to find some trace
of Miss Lucy Knutzen, who has been
missing since yesterday afternoon.' The
interest of Mr. and Mrs. Knutzen Is that
cf parents and the interest of the guests
is that of persons who paid their bills
to and had other financial dealings with
the absent girl, who acted as cashier of
the hotel.
Somehow a rumor has pervaded tho
Raymond Hotel that the young lady who
handled, all of the finances of the hotel
had been collecting bills, but had not
been paying them, and there is interest
centered In a hotel bill paid in advance
on the part of the guest who pays it
It is true that Mr. and Mrs. Knutzen
say that their daughter is "visiting," but
that announcement Is mads with little
confidence and with more of hope that
it may be true than with belief that It
is true.' But while the parents are mak
ing this statement they are trying to
trace the, young lady, but have merely
'succeeded in locating the disappearing
point out at Berkeley, where she Joined
a friend of her own sex and declared that
she was off for Salt Lake City by way
of the Carmen's ball and San Francisco.
The parents have. been searching in San
Francisco to try and satisfy themselves
and others that she is "visiting'."
, But' the guests at the hotel" who were
aaked.for their board in advance by the
young lady In question are trying to find
out if there is any connection between
the board that was paid in advance and
the "visit" which Miss Knutzen is now
enjoying.
All of thif. has disturbed the minds If
not the digestions of the Raymond's
guests, and when the parents engaged m
an ardent canvass among their friends
for some Information of their daughter s
whereabouts if caused the tongues of the
hotel gossips to swing with rumor and
r peculation about disappointed . love,
friends who liked the good things of
life and speculation in oil stock. '
Miss Knutzen left the hotel yesterday
and did not return last night. .Her par
ents were a little anxious and this morn
ing sent to the residence of Mrs. May
McChesney. who lives in Lorln, and who
is; a great friend of Miss Knutzen. They
found that their daughter had been with
her, but unfortunately Mrs. May u Mc-
Chesney had also disappeared, without
leaving any very definite statement as to
where she was going.
Mrs. McChesney has been recently di
vorced from her husband and sold her
furniture and household goods and went
to boarding with the family of George K.
Holloway at 6677 Shattuck avenue. Miss
Knutzen appeared at the. Holloway home
to see Mrs. -McChesney at 8 o'clock yes
terday morning. They left at 12:30 for
Berkeley, sfaying they were going to San
Francisco and would probably not return.

This rejoinder settled the question of

The witness declined to say that he had

Mr. Hall replied that the engineering
problems which he had attempted to solve
m the cases mentioned had been brought
to a successful completion and at a cost
within his estimates. The failure of all
the Mg irrigation districts, he said, was
due to the Wright irrigation act. the work
of lawyers and not engineers. It was the
fault of the lawyers that no experienced
engineer on this coast could say that he
had been connected with none but suc
cessful water systems.
He suaOily refused to discuss legal enig
mas with the opposing attorneys, saying
that be had placed a valuation on the
Contra Costa plant simply as an engineer
ing construction. All questions of equity,
he said, he preferred to leave to the
courts. Engineers, he said, had troubles
enough cf their own.
McCutchen read off a list of irrigation
Ech^rms with which the witness had been
connected as consulting engineer and all
of which had proved financial failures. He
twitted th? engineer with his failure to
make these projects successful.
The tactics pursued in attempting to
confuse the experts already examined for
the city were used in the water case to

Puzzling Questions Put to

by Opponents.
SEEK BY TRICKS
TO TRAP EXPERTS
Judge Allen is of the opinion that the
statute is ambiguous, and any way, he is
rpposed on principle to separating those
who would be one. Only a little over a
month ago he authorized the issuance of
a "license to Mr. and Mrs. Jaquith of
Berkeley, who had been divorced witht-i
a year.
Judce Hall was appealed to to unravel
the 1*-Kal snare and was of the opinion
that the license should not be issued and
that such rr.arriaf-e* were illegal, license
or no license. The disputed clause in the
code is as follows:
*'A subsequent marriage- contracted by
any person during the life of a former
husband or wife of such person with any
person other than such former husband
or wif* is illegal ar.d void from the be
ginning."
It was an evil fate that left the di
vorcees to the mercies of the hard-heartod
Harris ; had they appealed to District At
torney Allen, who happened" to be out of
the office at the time, the outcome woul !
have been reversed.
"But what shall we do with our furni
ture?" asked the unhappy pair: "it's all
bought and delivered." But Harris was
Inexorable. Law is law and they would
have to wait.
At the Clerk's desk they gave thek
r.smps as Frederick JMeinholrl 'and Mis.
Anna Meinhold. All went well until they
were requested to take an oath that they
had neither been divorced within a year.
It then developed that neither could swear
to that statement; they had been: divorced
from each other only a few months sir.ee.
They were confident that that fact should
not kfeep them apart, having each com"
to the conclusion that lift was not wortii
living without the other. lJeputy Cleik
Brownlnj? was not so sure. He decided to
consult the authorities at the courthouse.
The applicants accompanied him. They
found lx?puty District Attorney Harris
and submitted the question to him. Mr.
Harris steeled bis . heart against the
court's pleadings and handed down a:i
opinion to the effect that the proposed
ur.lon would be null and void under the
Ftatute.

The fife broke out just before daylight
In the Chinese laundry on Fifteenth
street, Just opposite the postofflce. It was
only a few moments before the light
frame structure was enveloped In flames
and a general alarm was turned In, call-
Ing out all the apparatus In the depart
ment. The -building was next to the
Shasta Hotel, also a frame structure, and
there was preat danger of a general con
flagration, roliceman Keefe turned In an
alarm, which was made general by Chief
Ball cf the Fire Department.'
Nipht Cjjptain Petereen was on duty at
the time and went at oneÂ© to the flre.
When he arrived he found a crowd of
Chinese standing in the street, excitedly
jabbering in their native tongue, while
from the burning building cries for help
were issuing. The Chinese did not seem
willing- to make any. effort to re-enter the
building, which was dangerously near
collapse, and still the cries came Xrom
within.
Captain Peterscn did not hesitate. He
buttoned his coat about him, pulled his
hat down over his eyes and bolted In
through the wall of flame. He found the
old Chinaman in his bunk, where he had
been caught by the fire. He was already
badly burned, but was still able to cry
for help. The burns coupled with his age
nnd the fright had paralyzed the old man
nnd he was unable to mÂ»ve and was being
Flowly roasted to death. Captain Peter
sen seized the man in his arms and carried
him out to safety and had him removed
to the Itecelx-ing Hospital.
Policeman Jack Shsrry was on hand and
when Captain Petersen disappeared ln*the
burning building the policeman followed.
He met the captain coming back with the
Chinaman in his arms. On the way out
Captain Petersen became Jammed behind
a door that he could not open because of
the load in his arms, and Sherry had to
break it down for him before he could es
cape.
The old man's burns were fatal, how
over, and though he was kept alive at the
hospital for -six hours he died from the
shock. Two horses in the building in the
rear were roasted to death.
The building was burned to tho ground
nnd all the laundry that Was in it at the
time was ruined. There is no information

SEATTLE, Feb. 15.â Mrs. Alma Pauline
Keefe, a daughter of John Sporck of 513
Boren avenue, aged 3.1 years, committed
suicide in the front yard of her father'a
residence at an early hour this morning.
Her body was found about 7 o'clock by
Oscar Keefe, her 8-year-old An, In. the
dead . woman's hand was clasped a revol
ver. There' were two empty shells in the
weapon and a large bullet hole in the body
Just below the heart, where a leaden mis
sile had entered. The- bullet passed
through the lobe of .-the heart and on
through the body, coming out directly be
,hind the shoulder blade on the left side.-
The woman's suicide is attributed to de
spondency. Her husband mysteriously
disappeared at .Everett eight years ago,
and It is supposed that he was murdered.
Less than two years' ago her mother,
Mrs. J. Sporck, committed suicide at tho
residence in this city o.v swallowing car
bolic acid.
It was 7 o'clock when 8-year-old Oscar
Keefe awakened and went out to the
kitchen door. The walk runs alongside the
house, and peering out toward. the front
gate the little fellow noticed his mother's
body lying on the grass beside the front
fence. The body, when found, was dressed
in night clothes, over which had been
thrown an overskirt and a fur cape.
Mrs. Keefe was possessed of consider
able wealth, and her father.- Mr. Sporck,
is the owner of much ol the best residenco
property on the "Four Hundred's" hill.
Coroner Hoye, after a thorough Investi
gation, has decided that no inquest will
be necessary. He says that the woman
evidently took her life during a fit of de
spondency. " ' .

ENDS HER LIFE
IN FATHER'S YARD
Calls Down a Professional Who
Had Worked Him and Other
Players on a Cunard
Steamer.
?
A prominent turfman here, attending
the winter race meet, told a good story the
other evening of an adventure on a Cun
arder*. "You never ! heard of Invisible
ink?" he said. "WÂ«ll, neither had I up to
a doien years ago, and my introduction ti>
it was rather peculiar. At that time I
was considerably greener in the ways of
the wicked world than I am at present,
and coming across on the Etruria, after a
season In London, I was fool, enough to
sit in a four-handed poker game with
three fellows I met in the smoking-room
o- the ship. The vulnerable point about
any greennorn who plays poker is hla
proud conviction that he. can protect him
self against any kind of 'work.' That was
.my own opinion, and consequently I did
n't care a copper who my three acquain
tances might be, as long as I found their
society entertaining. Two of them. I may
as well say right nere were plain, every
day busfness men from Boston. The other
was a small, dark, smooth-shaven chap
who introduced himself by the name ot
Cummings and said he was a lace buyer
for a firm of importers in New York.
"We began playing on tha second day
out of Liverpool, and inside of twenty
four hours were giving thÂ« game pretty
nearly our exclusive attention. The table
Â¦we used was in the far corner of the
smoking-room and . had four stationary
chairs. As is customary aboard ship, we
selected our seats at the beginning and i
kept them throughout the play. Cum
mings sat with his back to the partition
wall, I sat opposite and one of the-Bosto:i
fellows was on either side. I mention this
arrangement because it has a bearing on
what followed.
"We started out at a very easy gait," 1
continued the turfman, "but soon raised J
the ante high enough to make it pretty
warm. As tar as 1 could see none of my
three friends played more than* an ordi
nary clubroom game, and at the outset
the bulk of the luck drifted to the lace
buyer and myself. At the end of the first
aay we were each about 1150 ahead. Next
day I made most of the winnings myself
and was astonished at the succession of
good hands I held. As nearly as I can
remember I cleared up something like $4*).
mainly from 'the two' Boston men, and :
Cummings quit about even. Several times '
during the day I imagined the Bostonlans
looked at me with some slight suspicion,
all of. which afforded me considerable 1
amusement and satisfied me incidentally
that the game was absolutely on the
square. On the third day luck veered
around to the lace buyer, and he not only
gathered in my entire winnings but nearly
$200 besides. Meanwhile he tapped one of
the Bostonians for $300 and the other for
$150. Altogether he stood about $1200
ahead at the close of the afternoon. By
that time we were all pretty well fagged
out. and we agreed to quit for a couple
of hours and resume the play after din- ,
ner. Cummings left the table first, and I
tarried for a few moments to smoke a
cigar and chat with the Boston men.
"I had to get up to procure a light, and
on returning I dropped into the chair
which had been occupied by the "lace
buyer and began idly shuffling the deck
of cards. While so doing I happened to
notice a peculiar metallic speck at the
upper right-hand corner of the paste
board, which proved to be the king of
clubs. It looked like a minute dot of
some kind of aniline ink. The end of the
room where we sat was rather dark, and
there was a fixed lamp in the. molding
behind Cummings' chair that was kept
burning day and night. The spot caught
the gleam from this light and could only
Â¦ be seen when the card was held at a cer
tain slant. From any of the other chaira
it was entirely invisible. I was surprised,
of course, and in running over the deck I
soon found that all the face' cards and
aces were similarly spotted, some with
one and some with more dots, the ar
rangement being different in each case.
"The discovery upset me completely,
and I could see it was an equal bombshell
to my two companions. We laid our heads
together, and, to make a long story short,
we sent a steward after our lace-making
friend, and after a very brief but spicy
preface gave him two minutes by the
watch to disgorge his spoils. 1 must ad
mit he carried It off pretty well. 'This
looks considerably like a welch,' he said
coolly, 'and If the deck ' is marked I
know no more about It than you do.
However, Â«if you want your money back
you can have it. A gentleman.' said he,
'always wishes to avoid a scene.' With
that he counted out his Â¦ winnings and
bade us good-night.
""A year or so afterward I saw him at
Saratoga and learned positively that he
was a professional -short-card player,
who made a business of working the At
lantic boats. To get back- to the original
point, the stuff he used in marking the
deck was what Is known as 'Invisible ink,'
and while it is seldom employed nowadays
it can still be bought from any dealer in
gambling tools. It has the peculiar prop
erty of being visible only by artificial
light and when viewed from a certain
angle. How and when Cummings did his
marking, and why he left the deck on the
table ajre matters of mere conjecture.
Letting me win the other fellows' money
at the start-off and then winding me up
at the finish is easily understood. It's an
old gambling trick and diverts suspicion."

INVISIBLE INK
TO MARK CARDS
As a delegate from a new Territory.it
was not felt that Wilcox should be met
with the same strict construction required
in sustaining the right of a Representa
tive in Congress to his seat, as the dele
gate has only limited powers and is little
more than an agent. As to the charges
of treason, the letters placed in evidence
were written prior to the organic act mak
ing Hawaii a Territory, and there was no
disposition to go Into these prior issues.
Whatever may have been the technical
irregularity of the election, there was the
saving fact that a perfect machinery of
election was established, a ballot box was
regularly provided, practically every one
participated in the voting, and the will
of the people was expressed.
"And on broad political grounds," said
Tayler, "we felt that the people of these
insular possessions should understand that
they were not to be met by mere technical
objections which would deprive them of
representation."
After the meeting Tayler explained the
general considerations which had influ
enced the decision of the committee. The
case was not considered so much In its
technical aspects, but rather on broad
grounds, all the circumstances, conditions
and surroundings applicable to Hawaii as
one of our' new insular possessions being
taken into consideration.
Chairman! Tayler was authorized to
make the report to thateffect, which will
be submitted in about a week. " .

BRIEF LOCAL NEWS.
The trump card in the litigation is going
to be played by the Italian Consul. He
will have suit commenced to have the
deed given by him to Bacigalupi set aside
on the ground that It was secured by
fraud. "I will file the suit before Tues
day," said Attorney Lyons, who repre
sents Consul Serra. "The Consul is great
ly worked up over the exposure, lie was
deceived when he made the sale, and he
will probe until he gets at the bottom of
the matter. I expect to be able to easily
establish fraud, but I cannot give you the
names of the witnesses I rely on. The
feeling is very bitter, as you must know,
and I can't afford to take the chance of
having any of my witnesses 'put out of
the way' to prevent their appearance in
court.' It is apparent that there has been
crookedness on all sides in this case, and
the Consul Is anxious to expose the guilty
ones."
Attorney R. T. Harding fs now in the
fight. He represents several citizens,
among them Frank N. Belgrano, secre
tary of the Columbus Savings and Loan
Society, who with several friends intended
bidding for the property. "My clients,"
paid Harding, "went to E. Scodellettl.
Secretary of the Italian Consul, and told
him that they were prepared to offer as
high as $5000 for the land. Scodelletti in
formed them that the Consul had not yet
received the power of attorney from the
heirs, but promised to let them know
when it arrived and also inform them if
the property was to be sold. â¢ When they
learned that Bacigalupi secured the deed
for JSOO they became angry. Do you
blame them? They are now willing to
give the Consul aJl the assistance In their
power to reach the facts of the con-
Epiracy." â¢
Secretary Scodelletti remembers having
been visited by Hardlng's clients, but does
not remember them having made any defi
nite bid for the property. He also forgot
to inform Consul Serra of their visit. The
Consul Is in consequence angry at Scodel
lettl. As Attorney Harding says, "Do you
blame him?"
Italian Consul Is Angry.
Kern County by S. N. Griffith and W. H.
McKenzie to quiet title to the land? He
got them to bring the suit in the hope of
getting an easy title to the property. He
intended letting it go by default. We were
watching the turns too closely, however,
and M. B. Wagry, who has a claim on the
i property by right of location, filed a com
plaint in intervention. Ruef knows that
there are other claimants for the prop
erty, but he says nothing about them."
"1 didn't mention the fcult." said Ruef
in reply, "because there is absolutely no
merit to It. I was afraid if the bidders
knew of the suit they would be frightened
off and we would not get anything for the
heirs. We will file an answer to the orig
inal complaint and complaint in interven
tion and knock that particular phase of
the litigation out of court. Ex-Judge
Webb of Fresno is in town and Informs
me that he is going to commence proceed
ings in the United States court to have
the patent granted Cuoco set aside. It is
claimed that Cuoco did not live on the
.land while perfecting his title, as required
by law. Wonder who Judge Webb repre
sents? It's going to make a pretty tan
gle."
"Judge Webb represents Griffiths and
McKenzie," says Lamberson. "Another
nice little play. If Judge Troutt should
order new bids this projected suit will,
frighten intending bidders. Result: Prop
erty bought for a mere song, and then
euit dismissed. That's all."
Fantan Game" and will be a boiling cal
dron of pyrotechnic wonders.
Restaurants are arranging for the ex
pected Influx. Bills are being paid and
balances struck. To-day and to-morrow
the street stands will be in full swing
and on Monday morning, just at the hour
that the newspaper man sinks to hl3
sweetest repose, the din of the fire
cracker will usher In the rising sun. It
will be a hot time in Chinatown for the
nÂ«xt few days.
Bv reason of the gracious condescension
of the municipal authorities the celebra
tion of the present New Year promises to
exceed In barbaric' splendor anything be
fore 'seen in this city. .
But the most extraordinary license
granted is that regarding the discharge of
lirecrackers. This was heretofore con
fined to an hour in the afternoon for one
or two days. Now the time is extended
to include the hours from" 5 to S o'clock
in the morning and from 4 in the after
noon till S o'clock at n'.ght. Seme, of the
more enthusiastic Chinese residents have
a plan In mind with which to culminate
the festivities. It. is proposed to have a
grand pyrotechnic display in Washing
ton Square or Portsmouth Plaza, in
which two set pieces in particular shall
be exhibited. One of these will be the
sage features cf well-known legislators
ending In a cloud of smoke. The flnal
effect will be known as "A Night in a
t. .... , ., j , , , ,..,..,,.,..,.... .
All this is incident to the celebration of
the Chinese New Year, which commences
on Monday-. Stands of all kinds are per
mitted on the streets and a brisk trade Is
being done. This privilege has not been
granted for years heretofore and a replica
of one of the most picturesque cities of
China Is the Chinatown district of San
Francisco.

higher bands around their hats and the
hatchetmen are putting away their
weapons until after the holidays. In the
meantime every Chinese will gorge him
self with the enjoyment of the festivities.

Joy in Chinatown was at floodtide yes
terday morning, for {lie bars have been
let down and the "white devils" that
came from various parts of the State to
"investigate" Chinatown had left for
parts unkpown and tea boxes, movable
stands, sidewalks, curbstones and hun
â¢ dreds of old places were being utilized
j to display the wares that bring Celestial
j Joy to the hearts of the subjects of his
j Imperial Majesty,. Kwang Hsu, on the
i twenty-seventh anniversary of the com
j mencement of his reign.
True it may be that away off in far
; Cathay diplomats are counting heads. ;
, But the unintelligent Chinese resident of
| this city is doing the same thing, with a j
; difference. He is counting the heads of I
the chickens, the ducks and the geese, j
j the porkers and other good things that he
i rray eat, while the rattle of the fire
i cracker goes on for fifteen days.
Even the lilies that bloom in the spring j
have taken on the yellow coat of Flora.
Instead of having their floriated leaves
tinged with white, as in former years.,
the national hue of the imperial dragon
flag of China predominates. The abalone, i
the sunflower seeds and the watermelon 1
rinds incline to the same color. ;
Merchants have donned their long-tailed :
blouses, radiant in all the colors of the
rainbow. Boxers .are engaged in nailing |
up cases of Chinese delicatessen for in
terior friends, highbinders are sewing |

said Attornev Lamberson of the Baciga

anything about the suit commenced in
In th:Â« wranple over the property of
Cucro th? feeling is running high and
& clash is imminent. Attorney Ruef,
fearing that his office might be
broken into and the papers he has bear
ing on the matter stolen, placed the docu
ments in the SÂ«>fe Deposit last night, to
there remain until needed In court. Ruef
pays that the fight started by him is ac
tuated solely by a desire, to protect the
interests of the heirs if there still remains
any chance of protecting them. The ad
herents of Baeigalupf. on the other hand,
claim that Ruef is thinking more of Bohls,
who bought the land from Drinkhouse as
Public Administrator, than he does of
Cunco"6 relatives.
Fears Papers May Be Stolen.
Two minutes later the courtroom wa^
deserted and the elevator man was kept
busy for the next half hour carrying the
Interested and "disinterested" people in
the "desert land" of Kern County to the
basement flocr'of the City Hall.
'â¢Lkh the matter stand over until next
Tuesday morning." said Judge Troutt
wearily, when counsel had exhausted
themselves. "I will hear it when the mo
tion to distribute the estate to Bacigalupi
Is taken up."
Then followed another hubbub. Above
the din could be heard the deep bass voice
of Attorney G. Gunxendorfer. attorney for
i- jhls. matting formal protest and objec
tion against the proceedings.
"\\ e will have the paper in court at tho
proper time." replied Attorney Lamber
fon of Vlsalia, representing Bacig-alupt.
"We don't wan't to have any more paper?
dipappear from the record."
Wh^n the motion to have the property
reappraired came up for hearing before
Juajr*' Troutt yesterday, the courtroom
presented a scene not unlike that wit
nessed in the bear pit of a stock exchange
on a busy day. A dozen attorneys, repre
senting people anxious to get hold of the
land, attempted to matte themselves
heard. With the exception of Attorney
Ruef. who represents ex-Public Adminis
trator Drir.kho;i?e. they all wanted a con
tinuance. T. J. Lyons, attorney for the
Italian Consul, asiied that J3acigalupi b*>
compelled -to surrender into the custody of
the court the power of attorney sent hH
client by the heirs and given Bacigalupi
for recording at the time of the sale.
There is litigation sufficient in prospect
to keep the matter before the courts for
rears and without the slightest ray of
hope for the relatives of the decedent.
Italian Consul C. K. Serra, who held tr.e
power of attorney from the heirs, realizes
that he was grossly deceived when he sold
the land to Theodore Bacigalupi. Within
the next lew days he will institute pro
ceedings to have the aeed set uslae on the
grouna of fra.ua. Henry Uohls. cigarette

That there were several deep laid plan?
to loot the estate of Giovanni Cuoco, a
former bluejacket in the ravy of Uncle
Sam. and deprive his heirs, who live ir.
far-off Italy, of their heritage. Is certain.
The rharp!-.'? who prey on the estates of
The dead have fallen out, and while they
are bitterly denouncing one another, theie
Is but small prospect of the heirs reced
ing a tithe of their rights. The so-caJled
"desert land" in Kern County, bartered
away for a trifle, is believed to be one of
thÂ» richest holdings in the newly discov
ered oil district. While a drill has never
been put in the land, iherÂ« are shrewd o'l
speculators willing to pay Jy'j.OOQ for the
property if they can be assured of a per
fect title. The developments in the scan
dal yesterday go to pro\-e that there* were
fully a half dozen bands of schemers
all wicrkir.g . toward the same objective
pointâ the seirure of the estate. They
were afraid of one another and so ar
langed their plots In 'dog-in-the-manger"
iashion. that hi the event of tallure their
tucoesfful rivals in the looting game
would be put to no end of litigation before
tecuring the coveted prize left by the dead
Cuoco. Some of these involved have
now pooled issuts'wlth their former com
l>etltors in the robbery scheme and are go
jng to have the "law o'n the case."

Grand Jury Advised of Sure
Way to Suppress Chinese
Slave Traffic.
Miss Margaret Lake Makes a Sugges
. tion to the Inquisitorial Body.
: Charles Cram Disap
pears.
The Grand Jury, which Is Investigating
vice In Chinatown and the failure of the
police to suppress gambling and slave
dealing among the Chinese, was In session
yesterday for an extended period. Unlike
the farcical Investigation made by. the leg
islative committee on the same lines; the
work of the Gra/id Jury is not being
bossed by the Examiner.
If the inquisitorial body takes the action
suggested to it yesterday, there will be
little trouble in stamping out Chinese
gambling and suppressing to a degree the
slave dealing and retention of minors In
Chinese houses,of ill fame The fugges
tion was made by Miss Marg are Lake
the young woman who has aeioted l her
life to rescuing the slave girls of Cnina-
Mis'a Lake was called before the Grand
Jury and. testified as to the existence of
slavery, the maintenance of houses of in
fame, the detention of minors in the dens
and the engaging of white men to act as i
watchmen of the human chattels, wer
testimony was en thft same lines as given
before the legislative committee recently.
The sensational feature of yesterday s
investigation by the Grand Jury wan when
Miss Lake was asked if she had any sug
gestions to offer as to the means of end
ing the existlns state of affairs in China
town. .
' The young, woman told the Grand Jury
that of all the alleys In Chinatown. Ba
ker alley, owned by the Sullivan estate,
was the worst. She told how the place
was lined with houses of ill fame and
white watchmen were on duty to prevent
the ladies of the mission helping the slave
girls to escape. Miss Lake also told how
the alley was guarded by gates and was
looked upon as private property. She in
sisted that the Grand Jury should indict
the owners of the property for violating
the State law which makes it a misde
meanor for any person to let property
for immoral purposes.
If the suggestion of Miss Lake is acted
upon the list of persons Indicted will be
headed by Frank Sullivan, brother-in-law
to Mayor Phelan.
Miss Donaldlna Cameron, another of the
mission workers, gave similar testimony
to that given by Miss Lake.
The Grand Jury is very anxious to hear
from Charles Cram, the self-confessed
lter, whom the Examiner secured to In
troduce Assemblyman Wright and ono of
its reporters Into a fantan game. Cram,
who is an opium fiend, is . missing and
Deputy. Sheriff Renton so reported to the
Grand Jury. The father of Cram in
formed the Deputy Sheriff that he had
not seen his son since he went on the
witness stand before the legislative com
mittee last Tuesday and told how he had
lied to the police In making a statement
on the previous evening.
Cram is known to have been in the Ex
aminer office on Wednesday night, and it
Is thought that, lie Is far away from San
Francisco by this time. He possibly col
lected the $400 and a ticket to Australia
for arranging the fantan game, which he
stated to the police he had been promised.
"San Jose Charlie," the notorious owner
of many of the principal lottery games in
Chinatown, was examined yesterday and
repeated the perjury he committed before
the legislative committee. He positively
denied that he had ever seen a lottery
ticket written. Wong Fook. the only Chi
nese who admitted to the legislative com
mittee that he was the keeper of gambling
clubs, also appeared before the Grand
Jury. Reporter Boyle of the Examiner
testified as to purchasing lottery tickets.
In Chinatown, on one occasion being ac
companied by James H. Barry, one of the
Jurors. Charles Anderson also testified as
to purchasing lottery tickets. The Inves
tigation will be resumed next Wednesday
afternoon. .

A NEW DEPARTURE
A New, Effectual and Convenient
Cure for. Catarrh.
Of catarrh remedies there ls r.o end, but
cf catarrh cures there has always been a
great scarcity. There are many remedies I
to relieve, but very few that really cure.
The old practice of pnufnng salt water !
through the nos* would often relieve and
the washes, douches, powders and In- â¢
haiers In common use are very little, if
any. better than the old fashioned salt
water douche.
The use of inhaler3 and the application!
of salves, washes and powders to the imm I
and throat to cure catarrh ls no mort
reasonable than to rub the back to curÂ« ,
kidney disease. Catarrh is Jtin as much I
a blood disease as kidney troujble or rheu-
matism, and it cannot be cured bv local Â¦
treatment any more than they can be. i
To cure catarrh, whether In the head,
throat or Ftomach. su internal antiseptic
treatment is necessary ta drive the ca-
tarrhal poison out it the blood and sys-
tem, and the new catarrh cure iiÂ» designed
on thin p'aTi and the remarkable success
o* Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is becauss
being ufed internally It drives out ca-
tarrhal infection through action upon
etoraach, liver and bowels.
Wm. Zimmerman ut St. Joseph, relates
an experience with catarrh which Is of
Value to millions of* catarrh sufferers
everywhere. He s:iyÂ«. "I neglected a j
ellght nasal catarrh untl! It gradually ex- I
Â¦ tended to my throat and bronchial tubes j
and finally even mv stomach and liver
became affected, but as I was able to
koep up and do a ifiy's work I let It run I
c\om until my heating began to fail m<s j
Â«nd thÂ«=n 1 realized tbat I must eÂ«Â»t 'id
of catarrh cr lose my position, as I w*s
clerk and my hearing was absolutely
necessary.
"Some of my friends recommended an
I Inhaler, another a catarrh calve, but they
yrtre no pood In my ce*e, nor was any-
thing else until I heard of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and bought a package at
my drugstore. They benefited me from
the start and in less than four months X
vas eoniplr-trrly curej of catarrh, although
I had suffered nearly all my life from it.
"They are pleasant to take and to much
more convenient to i:*e than other catarrh
lemedit* that I feel I cannot say enough
In favor Â«f Stuart's Catarrh Tablets."
A HUle book on cause and cure of ca-
tarrh -wiil be mailed free by addressing K.
A. Stuart Co.. Marshall, Mich., and the
tablets ars cold by all druggists In the
