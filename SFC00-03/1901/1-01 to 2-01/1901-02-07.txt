The Ministers definitely decided to de
mand the imposition of the death penalty
qpon all twelve of the Chinese officials
named in the list submitted, including
those who are dead, on account of tho
moral effect upon the Chinese.
The sentence. on the living must be in
flicted, except In the cases of Prince Tuan
and Duke Lan. which the Emperor may
commute to banishment to Turkestan.
The foreign Ministers gave out for pub
lication a, secret Imperial edict handed to
them Â¦ yesterday by the Chinese peace
plenipotentiaries, which pleads especially
for the life of Tung Fuh Siang. commander
In chief of the army. It says the only
reason Is on account of the turbulent pop
ulation of - the provinces of Shensl and
Kansu. who are devoted to him, and might
rise and commit acts of violence againsr
the missionaries and' Christians,- which
the court would greatly deplore. . Conse
quently his punishment' requires caution,
deliberation and ' careful consideration.
The Emperor. It is pointed out. even In
the punishment j of Princes of the blood,
has not been moved by motives for their
protection. Why. then, should he do so
In the case of Tung Fuh Slang? What
had already been donÂ» . should be taken
Into consideration. His army had been
reduced to 5000 men with the object of
lessening his power and with the ultimate
object of his : future punishment which
will be promulgated In an edict, the lan

After the deprivation of his official rank,
the' Emperor will hereafter decide on a
heavy punishment.

1113 "Broadway. Feb. 6.
Maddened because of her refusal to be
come his wife. Bert Henderson, a tele
phone employe, shot Fannie O'Nell, IS
years old. in a rooui at the Ross House
at 11:30 o'clock to-night and then killed
himself as he lay in the bed from which
the wounded girl had fled to escape thi
point-blank range of the bullets that were
fired at her. â¢ /
Miss O'Nell was fortunate in that only
one of the leaden missiles took effect. The
ball entered her left cheek, ranged under
the nose and lodged under the right eye.
Henderson's wound was In the right tem
ple.
The girl Is an attendant at the offlce of
Dr. A. S. Larkey. She resides at 538 El
Dorado avenue, better known as Buena
Vista avenue. Piedmont. The tragedy fs
the outcome of an acquaintance sfwÂ»
formed six months ago at a lodge of
United Moderns In this city, of which shÂ»
and Henderson were members. In a short
while after the engagement matters took
a course displeasing to the young woman
and she broke off the affair. She declares
Henderson continued to shower his atten
tions upon her and she continued to re
ceive him In spite of the ending of their
proposed marriage plans. There was a
meeting to-night between the pair by ap
pointment at Fourteenth street ami
Broadway, the girl bavins? come* down
town on a Piedmont car to meet Hender
son.
From there they walked together to the
Ross House, where, according to the
young woman, they were to go ana tar*
over their disagreement. Mrs. Abbie E.
Woods, one of the owners of the hous-.
iriet the pa!r* arid Henderson Â«r.gas*d thÂ»
room. No. 2, paid the, rent for one night
and the girl* passed In with him.
The wounded girl on the operating table
at the Receiving Hospital told the follow
ing story of the subsequent happenings:
"Bert locked the door as soon as we
entered and pulled out a pistol, command
ing me to disrobe and retire, under pen
alty of belns killed. He kept brandish
ing the pistol in a crazy sort of way while
he kept up his threats to shoot me.
"Trembling with fear. I obeyed him. an-t
then he prepared to retire. I expostulated
and he kept on thrusting the pistol Into
my face. It seemed to me as if I would
be shot any second. I didn't, care to
scream, because I thought he would sure-
?â¢Then he declared I must promise to
marry him: that I must then and there
make good our engagement. I told him
I would not do that, and then I Jumped
up from the bed as he pulled the pistol
and snapped the trigger. I heard one ex
ploslon and as I ran toward the door I
felt the sharp sting of the bullet that hit
me and nearly knocked me down. Strug
gling over to the door and dripping with
blood. I managed 1 to unlock It and scream
for help. Then there was a third shot,
and I saw Bert fall back on the pillow.
He had put the pistol to his head and
killed himself. By that time a lot of peo
ple had gathered. . Some one came and
put me on the sofa, where I remained un
til the police ambulance came."
Miss O'Nell said Henderson's home was
somewhere .In San Francisco. Before hÂ»
went to work for the telephone company
he had been in the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company's employ.
The elrl Is a brunette, plump and of
dark complexion. She Is quite prepossess
ing. On the operating table she displayed
a phenomenal nerve, even before the- sur
geons assured her that sne would not suf
fer permanent Injury from the wound.
She will be kept at the Receiving
Hospital until she has fully recovered
from the shock. The police are satisfied
that her version of the shooting Is true.'
Dr. H\ $. Ktrgan, who was passing on
Ninth street near the lodglng-bonss.
was called in- He gave the girl tempo
rary attention. He examined the man
and pronounced him to be dead. ThÂ»
police sent the wounded girl to the hospi
tal and then the Coroner took charge of
Henderson's body. The scene In the death
chamber was a ghastly one. The bedding,
walls and furniture were covered with
blood; the clothing of both the girl and
her companion was strewn about the
place, and the hprror of the scene was
heightened by the dramatic story of the
young woman who so narrowly escaped,
death.
The pistol used by the desperately In
fatuated man -was a weapon of bulldog
type, carrying a hea%T bullet. The one
which struck Miss O'Neil would have
pierced "her brain if It . had been aimed
half an Inch higher.
The wounded girl accepts the situation
IlkÂ© a stole. Her most serious fear was
that the wound would Injure her features.
The hospital surgeon assured the girl that
this would be obviated by the careful u>Â»
of the surgical Instruments. As she
awaited the operation the young woman
Impatiently said:
"It Is too bad. I know. If I had only
taken the warning of my folks this would
not have occurred. They told me that hÂ»
would make trouble 1 for me. But I had
no Idea he would try to kill me. It was
only to have a quiet discussion that I
went to the room with him. and I did not
realize what was to occur until he be
gan to threaten me with the pistol.
"I never was at that place before, and
had no idea where he was taking; me."

to advices received by the Empress of
China to-day a small foraging expedition
of Japanese -and British were badly cut
up by Boxers on January 15, not far from
Shanhaikwan. The party, which num
bered ten or. twelve, started from Shan

the village of Â¦ â¢ Lochunton. three miles
from Shanhaikwan, when it was attacked
by a band of 300 Boxers. The British and
Japanese made a running fight .of it. Five
of the Japanese managed to get back to

another very â¢ badly wounded man was

Two companies were sent against the'vil

act. He outdistanced his men while lead-

up against^ the; wall and kept the' Boxers

with his revolver,- but as he'was out of
ammunition he must have been killed had
his men not arrived just in time. .

THE HAGUE. Feb. 6,â The wed
ding eve of Queen Wilhelmina and
Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin shows a winter carnival
holding sway over The Hague. It is an
ideal evening, clear and cold. Already
100,000 Hollanders, with many foreigners,
have been added to the city's population
and trains from many parts of this an
cient kingdom are bringing thousands
more. People are marching about or in
carriages, singing or playing the national
anthem. Wherever a band is heard they
take up the hymns "Wilhelmus Van Nas
sau" and "Wien Neer Lands Bloed." Ev
erywhere are singing societies in uniform
and wearing medals, sober looking Dutch
men who chant solemnly, officials and
prominent visitor*". Groups of young men
and women costumed In -white and orange
and In other bright colors are parading
about singing and making fun with the
crowds as in the MardI Gras. The tri
colored flags of Holland, the house of
Orange, are everywhere displayed, with
an occasional light blue banner of Meck
lenburg-.
Orange paper lanterns hanging among
the fir trees which line the main streets
and looking like big clusters of oranges
throw light over the decorations. Every
man and woman wears an oraHge rosette
with a picture of the bride. Some, though
these are few, display also a portrait of
the bridegroom. -
Queen Wllhelmina dined at the palace
this evening with Duke Henry and the
families of the two. Occasionally she ap
pears at an upper window to bow in re
sponse to some serenading party.
A striking feature of the festivities is
their democratic atmosphere. There are
no cordons of policemen or soldiers to
hold back the crowds. There are no
swarms of detectives. There is no talk of
anarchists.
The Queen and Duke Henry have spent
a large part of the week thus far in driv
ing about' the city In order to give the
Â¦people a chance to see them. During the
afternoon to-day they rode out a few
miles along snow-covered roads to Fix
hing. a village, where a fisheries exhibi
tion Is being held. They went In one of
the state carriages, which was drawn by
four horses. Her Majesty, who wore a
red and gold cloak and furs, carried a
big bouquet of white flowers tied -with
orange ribbons. The Duke was arrayed
in the uniform of a Dutch admiral. The
Queen Mother and the mother of the
Duke, with several ladles of tbe court
and a few officers, followed [n carriages.
The Queen's constant escort Is twelve
young noblemen, riding bay horses with
white Faddles and wearing maroon
uniforms primmed with black fur. W her- T
ever the royal cortege appears the people
good naturedly clear tne way. "When the
crowds are thick policemen and others
clasp hands and form a line to keep .them
back.
The Queen bows and smiles with gen
uine youthful enjoyment. The Duke Is
considered ' cold, however. and looks
bored. He raises his hands stiffly in mili
tary salute. His friends say the truth
is that he Is exceedingly shy and, being
only Ci years of age, Js greatly embar
rassed by his prominence.
The programme for to-morrow Is as fol
lows: At 1:15 a. m. the Minister of Justice
and the witnesses of the marriage will as
semble In the white room of the palace.
At 11:30 a. m. the civil marriage will oc
cur In the presence of the nearest rela
tives. After that the royal party will
proceed to the ' church in procession.
'After the religious service the royal party
will return in procession to the palace,
where Queen Wilhelmlna will hold court
and receive the. congratulations of others
than members of the royal family and
representatives of the royal families.
At 1:30 p. m. there will be a gala
luncheon and at 4:15 p. m. the couple will
depart on their honeymoon, which is to
last a. fortnight. It will be spent at the
royal country seat known as Het Loo,
and on Us termination bride and bride
groom will go to Amsterdam, where a
number of receptions will be held. An
immense concourse of royal visitors Is ex
pected and not only will all the royal pal
aces at The Hague and in Its suburbs be
taxed to the utmost, but likewise every
room of the Hotel du Viex Doelen has
bern taken b.y the Queen for her wedding
week for the accommodation of her
guests. /fV^-*
The gowns of the Queen's trousseau are
mostly pale greens, grays, blues and
whiten, tliese suiting her blonde complex
ion â¢best- Her bonnets , arc of a severe
style for a young woman, most of them
being close fitting toques, instead of. the
broad brimmed hats worn by most girls.
For her public entering Into Amsterdam
her Majesty has a royai robe of white
velvet, with a train trimmed with ermine
and a mantle lined with ermine. At one
of the receptibns In Amsterdam after
honeymoon she will wear a gown of white
satin, embroidered around the hem and
bodice with a small tracery of orange
leaves and a court train of rich orange
velvet lined with white silk. She has an
outdoor crown of delicate gray, combined
with white and pale blue, "scarcely show
ing embroidered steel arnrf silver sequins.
With this goes a large hat. She has also
a soft hunting costume, of dark bottle
green, unornamented. and another of
trimmed cloth applique. There is a walk-
Ing dress of dark green with gold threads
and another of green mignonette cloth,
combined with white. The Queen has four
plain riding habits.
BEAUTIFUL WEDDING DRESS.
It Will â¢ Bs the Most Magnificent
Bridal Robe of Modern Times.
THE HAGUE. Feb. 6.â Queen Wilhel
mlna's wedding dress, fs of course, a mat
ter of supreme interest in connection with
the happy occasion, and few have enjoyed
the privilege of seeing what will be per
haps the most magnificent bridal robe of
modern times. It has been designed by
Messrs. Nicaud of Paris, and meantime
the marvelous embroideries, which will
constitute one of its most notable fea
tures, are being executed in the Royai
School of Art Needlework, in conjunction
with the Rljks Museum of Amsterdam.
This Institution follows closely the model
of .a. similar school at South Kensington
and is directed by Mme. Van Emstede
Winkler. a lady who Is a practical worker
herself. She has selected her eight or nine
most highly skilled students, one of whom.
Mrs. Tue Laer, the only American woman',
and for some weeks past the ladles have
all been continuously employed upon their
beautiful task.
The entire dress itself is to be of cloth
of silver, so exquisitely supple and fine in
texture that It suggests those Indian mus
lins of our grandmothers which "could be
pulled through a ring." It has been es
pecially woven and naturally at a great
cost. It will be made uo over the richest
white glace silk, and the bright shimmer
of the tissue is even Â»>nhancsd thus. The
whole front of the jupe will be worked In
a tapering design, harmonizing with the
train, broad at the hem and narrowing to
ward the waist. The full court train of
two and a half meters on the ground falls
from the -waist and Is surrounded by two
broad bands of the embroidery. The gen
eral idea of this Is detached sprays of
orange blossom and their foliage con
nected in artistic style by scrolls and rib
bons. Each of the clusters of the flowers
has a single fully opened bloom, and Is
surrounded by buds more or less devel
oped. F2ne seed oeaiis are being- used
for these, while the foliage is indicated by
silver threads and paillettes.
In addition to the pearls and paillettes
no fewer than six kinds of silver bullion
twist are employed to produce the differ
ent effects required and most of tha Intel-
lacinc ribbon suggested is highly raised.
or, in technical form, "couched." The
embroidery is worked upon tl.e silver tis
sue and the white silk foundation as well,
thus imparting to- it richness as well as
flirr.ness. No work Is to appecr upon the
bodice, which, according to Dutch custom
for a state wedding, will be cut low. It
is to be draped with. Brussels laeo, "of
which the Queen possesses an extremely
valuable collection. bo:h of antique an.1
modern examples, and the veil will be of
the same lovely order. It Is Impossible
to imagine a dress more regally appro
priate for the wear c! the fair Queen
bride. The Queen's mother will wear at
the ceremony a dress of a beautiful tono
of heliotrope velvet, the bodice draped
with lace and â¢mousseline" de sole. "
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â Cuba is the
most serious question, now before: the
Government. It is the one question which
may cause an extra session of Congress.
All other questions can be disposed of by
the present Congress or can wait until
the regular session of the next Congress
in December. There have been many pro
tests by Senators . a"nd Representatives
against an extra session, but the Presi
dent sees danger in delay. The constitu
tional convention in Cuba is rapidly draw
ing near its adjournment when It will
present the product of Us work to this
Government for approval.'
The President insists that this Govern
ment should not keep Cuba waiting for a
verdict. The United States, as liberator
of Cuba, must be prepa'red to deal frank
ly with the new republic because. of the
relations it must bear from now on for
all time to this country. Congress, by its
sentimental gush over .independence for
Cuba two years ago. made it practically
impossible for the President to acÂ«t alone
In this matter. Congress must- share re
sponsibility with the executive of saying
whether or not the Cuban- constitution
meets with the approval of the United
This question is regarded as more seri
ous than that of subsidy bills, appropria
tion bills or civil government for the Phil
ippines. It is a crisis t in Cuban .affairs.
It is as great as the crisis three years ago
when Cuba was fighting for independence
and the TTnlted States Intervened to drive
Spain from the island. It is a crisis
which demands immediate attention after
thn con vert^iorr in I iavana- ; -aa ' afibpte d~a
constitution. It is to -be the birth" of, the
republic for which thrts Government
stands sponsor, and the President insists
the responsibility is -so great that Con
gress should meet in extra session to ap
prove or disapprove of that constitution.
If is one question the -President looks
upon as grave enough to justify an extra
session. He may not call an extra ses
sion, but is prepared to do so 'and will
do so if the Cuban constitution is sent
to Washington within the next two
months. I
It Is not a question as to whether that
constitution meets with the President's
approval or not. It is not a question
whether {he Cuban convention recognizes
any relations with the United States or
not. He will call Congress together to
act upon the constitution, whatever it
may be. The President has been frank
with Senators and Representatives who
have discussed the question of an extra
session with him. He has told them that
Congress must act with the executive
upon this question of the Cuban republic.
He is not disposed to find fault with the
pledges made by Congress in the Cuban
resolution of April. 1S9S. He approved
these resolutions at the time, and acted
upon them in using the army and navy
for forcible intervention in Cuban affairs.
A new feature of the Cuban question
has now come to issue. It is what limita
tions, if any. phall be put upon the Inde
pendence of the Cuban republic. Con
gress must decide whether the constitu
tion of Cuba justifies this Government in
withdrawing its troops. and leaving the
child it has taken from its old parents
to stand alone and shoulder all the conse
quences and responsibilities of indepen
dence. The. President believes it unwise
to delay action or adopt expedients. He
believes the relations of Cuha to the
United States should not be fixed. His
expression is: "We are to make our bed,
and we should ree that it is one on which
we can lie."

SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1901.
States.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.well in the district. - Mr. Robert, however,
made no definite charge, having only a
suspicion upon which to base his opinion.
"While you were on a tour of inspection
of Chinatown with the Police Commis
sioners did you discuss with Chinese the
proposition of having gamblers in the dis
trict pay $3000 a menth for immunity?"
"I did not, sir," was the reply.
"Did any one else make such a proposi
tion?"
"Not to my knowledge, sir."
"Do you know whether or not Chinese
were warned of raids to be made by Cap
tain "Wittman?"
"I do not know that any such warnings
were ever given."
"During your occupancy of the position
of Chief of Police Uid you-ever. receive an
intimation from any of the Chinese gam
blers that they were being blackmailed by
members of the department?" Â»
"No such intimation was ever made to
me." replied the Chief.
"By whose orders were the Immoral
women of Chlnatow.i. forced to move from
the lower floor of buildings?"
"By my orders alone. When lottery and
gambling dens wort forced to obey the
same orders their number decreased one
third." ; _Â¦"Â¦:'.â¢'- :â¢'-
"Can you take the committee through
Chinatown and without the aid of Cap
tain WIttman's list point out the lottery
agencies and gambling houses?"
"I cannot. I am able only to show you
where are the clubs."
"When you issue an order for a raid do
your captains know of your order?"
"Certainly, as soon as the order Is Is
sued." Â¦;
"Have 1 ycu ever tried the experiment of
making a raid without letting your cap
tains know of It?"
"No, sir, I never have."
The investigation was again leading
toward Wlttman, who eits in the court
room uneasy, unhappy, twirling his mus
tache and trying with lamentable auc
cess to look unconcerned.
"Where does Wittman keep himself?"
Webber asked.
"His office is in thlfc hall."
"How often Is he In Chinatown?"
"I do not know. He has been there
several times, with me."
The Investigation then turned to that
famous telephone message from Mayor
Phelan to Chief Sullivan. Webber went
fishing in an effort to discover where
Mayor Phelan was at that time, but the
endeavor was futile. Again Chief Sul
livan declared that the Mayor was In
most excellent humor.
"When you discovered that the pro
posed plan to license Chinese gambling
was contrary to the law what was done?"
asked Webber. H c ;
"The plan was v abandoned." was the re
ply. "And I was commanded to enforce
the law. The Police Commission had nev
er adopted the plan. They had simply
taken It under advisement and when Its
illegality was discovered It was aban
doned."
"You eald yesterday that all the news
papers were favorable to the plan with
the exception of the Examiner, which ob
jected to the gambling feature. Do you
know this of your own knowledge?"
"I do not know that of my own knowl
edge. I was told so by Commissioner
Newhall, who Informed me that the news
papers were willing to give the plan a
fair trial and not to hamper the commis
sion In its efforts." . v
The Inquiry then turned to a detailed
discussion of. the social evil and the rea
son of the Police Commission for tolerat
ing It In this city. In this discussion
Chief Sullivan had very much the best
of the argument- He showed that the
policy has been to tolerate what is be
lieved to. be a necessary evil and to im
prove the conditions under which it exists.
Mayor had not 'concluded when the hour
for adjournment arrived and he was tol<l
to be on hand again at 10 o'clock this
morning, which he promised to do. He
was led part of the time, by the question
ing of members of the commission. Part
of the time he had his own way and
volunteered several statements that were
not asked for. He began by telling his
name and the facts concerning his holding
office as Mayor. Thi3 was his third
term. Two terms were under the consoli
dation act and the present one under the
new charter. The powers he derived from
the charter, as related. to the Police De
partment, were to appoint the Board of
Police Commissioners and It was Incum
bent on him to see that the Police Com
missioners properly performed their duty.
He was also enabled, under the charter, to
make, recotnendations to the Police Com
missioners concerning their policy. He
could attend the meetings of the commis
sion and take part in discussion, but had
no vote. ' ;
"Did you offer any suggestions concern
ing appointments on the police force?"
asked Mr. Schillig.
â¢ "I did not offer any suggestion concern
ing appointments, with i one exception,
which was in relation to the office of Chief
of Police. I recommended the appoint
ment of Chief Sullivan."
âMayor Phelan then testified that, under
the charter, the executive sessions of the
Board of Police Commissioners were sup
posed to be secret. The Commissioners
were given sole control of the Police De
partment by the charter, but he did not
wish to hold out these, facts to keep
back any information
\'PÂ° o?^ ou , g1ve tne Ch 'ef of Police his
policy?" asked Mr. Schillig.
"No.- The Commissioners should act in
dependently; but. if they have a bad
p< i!A? y ' 1 ou S ht to be present and object."
Then Mayor Phelan said that he had
thought about the Police Department con
siderably. He believed that there had
been attempts in Chinatown to corrupt
policemen and he believed there had been
corruption, but this he had only by report
and not by personal knowledge. He con
sidered that, since he heard of this cor
ruption, he had made radical changes In
the Police Department. In the first place
he had named a new Board of Police Com
missioners and he had also recommended
the appointment of a new Chief. He be
lieved the department to be on a better
footing than formerly, so far as corrup
tion was concerned.
"Why did you recommend Sullivan for
Chief?"
"Well, he had been my secretary and I
knew him. The recommendation was
made when there was a contest for the
place and a deadlock was on."
Dldn t you think there were good men
in the Police Department for the do
pJtion?"
"There was no such man that I was
aware of. In Sullivan I knew that I had
a man of Integrity. He had been In my
office and I - knew of . his methods
Honesty appeared to me to "be the first
requisite for the place, and ordinary ca
pacity to know the duties of the position
was the second consideration. I knew
that he had been in the National Guard
for a long Â¦ period. . I was surprised,"
added the Mayor,. "to hear Chief Suflivan
testify that he had not read the Penal
Code, for we often had to consult it
when . he was in my office. I think that
he must have meant that he had not con
sidered It as a student or as a Jawyer "
The Mayor testified that, until he had
the responsibility of naming the Police
Commission, " he did . not have any very
Intimate knowledge of the affairs of the
Police Department. Probably there were
men In the department who were quali
fied to be appointed as Chief, but he did
not know them. While he had studied
law fjor two years once, it was from the
historical side and concerning the under
lying principles. Ho had a general knowl
edge of the Penal Code. The sections
concerning which the commission had In
quired had never been called, to. his notice
by any citizen. No one haa ever nsked
him to attend to the enforcement of an
ordinance concerning vice and crime, not
even a clergyman. . Certainly, It was the
duty of the Police Department to tarry
"I do. not think so."
"There are gambling dens In this prop
erty,, are there not?"
"Not that I know of. There Is a house
of ill-fame in one of the buildings."
"Do you know the house 703 Pacific
street?"
"Yf \ That is In the Sullivan property."
"Do you kmAv that it Is a lottery
place?"
"I do not."
"Do you know that the Sullivan prop
erty has been condemned by the Board of
Health?"
"I know that it has not been; the
plumbing has been condemned." / "
"Have any arrests been made on the
property?"
"I do not know."
"Do you think the Mayor knows of the
vice being conducted In his brother-in
law's building?"
"I do not know."
"Do you think he would suppress It. If
he knew It?" .
; "I do not know."
"Do you think Sullivan knows of this
vice?"
"I have not the slightest idea."
"How many men would you need to de
stroy gambling in the Chinese quarter?"
"Between 300 and 400 men."
' "How many patrolmen are there In the
City?" \
"There arc 505 men."
"How many Sn Chinatown?"
"Between six and eight men."
"Where is the principal defect In sup
pressing Chinese gambling in this city?"
"The principal defect Is the difficulty In
securing evidence. In most contested
cases there Is an acquittal on this ground."
"Did- Chinese a"t any time make an ac
cusation against Officers Young and Sam
uels?" . â¢ .
"Such charges were made," was the
answer. "The officers were tried by the
Police Commission and were exonerated."
"Were accusations ever made to you
against Sereeant Brophy?"
"No charges, were ever made against
him," was the reply.
"Do you know Ho Yow, Chinese Consul
General?" â¢
"I do."
"Did you not visit him and did he not
directly accuse Sergeant Mahoney of cor
ruption in Chinatown?"
"Ho Yow never made any such charges
to me."
"Did Captain Seymour tell you any
thing?"
"He did not." ~ .-,-'-.;
"Did any one ever ask you to rescind
your order forcing gamblers up from the
ground floor?"
"Yes; several persons asked me to do
so. Among them were Attorneys Joseph
Coffey and Keough and John H. Wise, ex-
Collector of the Port."
"In your efforts to suppress Chinese
gambling have you ever tried to learn
who are the owners of the property in
which games are conducted? 1 .'
"I have not."
"Don't you know that the Penal Code
makes It an offense to rent property for
gambling purposes and that, knowing
this, you could go after the owners?"
"I have never gone after them."
A running nre of questions relative to
State laws on gambling and social evll3
was- then -mado by Assemblyman Laird.
Chief Sullivan showed himself rather hazy
on these questions, none of wh'lch, how
ever,'were of particular Importance In ref
erence to the purpose of the inquiry. The
questioner did not seem to understand
that It has been the policy of the police
.for many years to tolerate social vieÂ© as
long as It does not become offensive to
the general public and submits to regula
tion. Webber" also took a hand In 1 the
affair, and with that unfairness which
seems to characterize his part of the ex
amination he made matters worse. Chief
Sullivan was then excused from the wit
ness stand.

The plan of the commission was not only
to. license but to regulate so as to protect
pubic health.
Then came again tho discussion of
remedial laws In reference to Chinese
gambling.
"You think," asked Webber, "that if we
were to modify the laws of incorporation,
you could suppress gambling in China
town?" â¢
"I believe," was the reply, "that if the
laws of incorporation Â¦were modified we
would be very greatly assisted."
"Do you know Attorney Coffey?"
"I do."
"Has he ever been your representative
In Chinatown?"
"He has not."
"Iras he ever conducted negotiations
with Chinese for you?v
"No," was the emphatic reply. ,
"Has he ever received -any fee?"
"Not to 1 my knowledge."
GAMBLERS HERALDED
POLICE PROTECTION
Chief Sullivan Gives a Peculiar Rea-
son for Removing Officer Upon
Whom Suspicion Rested.
Back again to .the Phelan plan of li
censing crime the committee went, but
very little of Importance was elicited. It
was developed that the consent of the
Police Judges had not been secured for the
plan, and even If the commission had
reached a conclusion the acceptance of
the Police Judges would still have been
necessary.
"When the Illegality of the proposed
Phelan plan was discovered," asked
Knowland, ""did you and Mayor Phelan
or you and any member of the Police
Commission enter into any private agree
ment to carry the plan into effect?"
"No, sir; absolutely no. such agreement
was ever made."
"Did Dent Robert and Thomas Williams
of the Examiner ever make any direct
charges to you against Sergeant Ma
honey of the Chinatown squad t"
"They, did not. They declared their be
lief that things were not right with the
Chinatown squad, but no direct charges
were made."
"Why did you remove Sergeant Shea
from the Chinese district?" â¢ . .
"Because he requested me to do so.'/
"Was there no other reason?"
"Absolutely none,"
"Have you ever removed any officer
from the Chinese district?"
"I have. I have removed- Sergeant Ma
honey because I believed that he was not
as activo as he should have been in his
duties. He was lax and I removed him.
I had no other evidence than my own
observation. - I do not believe that he
was levying blackmail. As far as I am
concerned 1 do not believe that he was
dishonest. There was a suspicion, . of
course, that because he was -not active
there might be dishonesty, but Mahoney
has been in the department many years,
has an excellent record and I had nothing
to show that he would jeopardize it."
"But you removed him because of the
vague attack of -Examiner representa
tives, did you not?"
"I believed the Examiner was Â¦ sincere.
It was then friendly to the department-"
"Since you have had differences with It
you believe now that It Is insincere?"
"I simply share a general public opin
ion In that regard," was the answer. -
"Are there any papers in San Francisco
which are sincere?
"I will have to refer you to the pro
prietors," was the Chiefs reply.
"Do you know that Chinese bulletins
were posted in i the Chinese quarter/ an
nouncing that persons could visit > gam
bling games without fear of police Inter
ference?" -y
"I do not know the fact. This Is the
first -I. have heard of it."
"Do you know Frank J. Sullivan?"
"I do." .
"Relative of yours?"
. "I regret to say â¢ he is not. . He - is a
brother-in-law of Mayor Phelan."
"He owns property In Chinatown In the
square bounded by Stockton, Dupont, Pa
cific and Jackson streets, does he not?"
.; "He does." " 7
"This property Is (among the foulest In

MAYOR SAYS BRIBERY
IS IN THE VERY ALB
Insists That Chinese Are Extremely
Cunning and Take the Initia
tive in Tempting.
Concerning the treatment nf gambllnff
houses and houses of prostitution, he
caid that there .had not been any plebis
cite or referendum on the part of the
citizens of San Francisco, and he. there
fore, considered that It would be difficult
to say what their wishes were. How
should any one know? It was like rumor3
of briberyâ In the air.
The upper office of the Police Depart
ment consisted of the detectives and the
Chief. . He had heard the Chief testify
that the upper office consisted of the de
tectives. The Chief had been too modest
to include himself. He had talked over
the affairs of the department with the
Chief, and was convinced that there bad
been corruption, especially in Chinatown,
lie had a statement from ex-Chief Crow
ley that he had been offered from $3000
to J4000 per month If he would permit a
Chinese syndicate to name the China
town squad. He, the Mayor, knew that
the Chinese were bribers. If there had
been any wrongdoing going on In China
town it was safe to say" that some one
had been receiving" money.
' Soon after he received the statement
from Chief Crowley, that he had testified
to, a personal friend of the Mayor carna
to the city from San Jose and told him
that a Chinaman who had formerly
worked for* him and who had become tho
secretary of a Chinese society, had tele
phoned for him to come up to San Fran
cisco and had offered him $200 per month
for himself and had also offered to pay
any sum for the services of an attorney
if he would manage to secure Immunity
for the Chinese lawbreakers. The Mayor
conferred with the Police Commissioners
about that matter- He knew from the facts
he had mentioned that the Chinese would
take the initiative In bribery. He thought
that the Police Department needed over
hauling and recommended the appoint
ment of the present Chief for that rea
son.
"Do you think there has been any Im
provement In the lower ranks of the Po
lieo Department since you have been in
office?"
"I feel that there has. The personal
appearance of the men and their disci
pline has Improved."
The Mayor said that he did not per
sonally know of any gambling going on
in Chinatown, but he believed It to bo
going on every day and night In the
year. He presumed that the fault was In
the law of evidence and in the three
stout doors. . >- 'Â¦ -Â¦â¢
"Are you responsible for this?
"I am in a measure responsible. I have
advised with the Board of Supervisors
about legislation. I have been advised
that such legislation would be of nw -val
idity. The doors they have In Chlna
tow'n are of wood, common house doors.
Any legislation that would apply to them
would apply to house doors."
The Mayor said he had not personally
visited the gambling houses of the city.
He went to. a Chinese gambling house
about three months ago and found no Im
pediment to entrance. The Chinese were
not gambling but were seated around a
table. At another place the doors wero
shut. He was Informed by an officer who
accompanied him that .gambling waa
probably going on Inside, but he did not
go there to arrest any onÂ©.
"What is your remedy for these evils?"
asked Mr. Schilllg. .
Tho Mayor answered that this Involved
questions of constitutionality. In France
the size of houses and their height Is reg
ulated by law. Possibly the California
Legislature would amend the law of evi
dence as to what should constitute proof
of the existence of a gambling house. The
present outfit of a Chinese gambling
house consisted of a common, plain table
and some beans. Uncooked beans were
no evidence of gambling, but with. beans
the Chinese played fantan. There had
been arrests, but the courts have held
that beans and a table did not constitute
evidence of gambling and had thrown the
cases out of court. If the police drove
fantan out of the gambling houses it
would be played In the Chinese wash
houses. The Mayor did not believe that
any white men were gambling at Chinese
games, with the exception of Chinese lot
teries. The only injury done by fantan
was to the Chinese. The morality of the
Chinese had not received much attention
when there was such an abundance of
people on the outside calling for atten
tion. The ownership of the houses In
Chinatown had been discussed and It had
been ascertained that they were princi
pally owned by foreigners and non-resi
dents.
PIÂ»EA FOB THE PLAN
OF LICENSED CRIME
Other Cities and Takes Fling
at the Press.;
His Honor Describes Experience cf
The Mayor took a shy at the news
papers and* said that they were shielding
the white gamblers. They wero printing
the lists of the lottery drawings. Some
time ago it was proposed to arrest the
proprietors of. the papers for this. They
were conferred with, but said that they
were gentlemen and did not wish to be
arrested . and . put in jail to consort â¢ with
gamblers and prostitutes. They suggested
that a newsboy be arrested to . make a
test case, . The case was thrown out of
court. In view of ' that experience fair
The legislative investigation of the Police Department of this
city Zi'as resumed yesterday and although the testimony was of pub
lic interest absolutely nothing lias yet been developed to support a
charge that corruption exists in the department in reference to Chi
nese affairs. Chief of Police Sullivan placed himself in a most em
barrassing position by denying the truth of a recital of an incident
to the truth of which Captain Seymour subsequently testified.
Maxor Phelan teas also on the zntness stand and related rvhat
he thinks he knozvs of police affairs and things in general. lie be-
Heirs that the department is pure and if it is not. it should be made so.
The inquiry zrill be resumed this morning.
CHASING SHAIX>WS OF
POLICE â¢RT.Arrrr-M-ATT.
Investigators Fish Again and Again
in Captain Wittman*s Direction,
but Without Eesult.
When the Investigating committee met
yesterday morning Webber was again
i&te. He seems to think that late arrivals
are fashionable. Chief Sullivan was at
ence summoned to the stand and present
ed the Wlttman list cf white and Asiatic
houses of -evil name and also of Chinese
gambling houses. The list was formi
dable If not exhaustive, the credit which
WHtmsin claim- for It.
Chief Sullivan waÂ« given permission to
change bis testimony of the day before
end to tell the committee that while Ser
geant Malioney was Jn charge of the
Chinatown squad complaint was made by
Kobert of the Exaxninw that all was not
Plaj might have been expected. The
..layer saic! that he wished, then and
there, to give notice that he would have
the proprietor of .-my newspaper publish
ing a lottery drawing in the future ar
rested, and ho would have him prose
cuted umier the State and the Federal
laws. ......
The Mayor. a!so testified that he had
considered th*Â» Pittsburg plan and tfca:
he had corrcspondtd with the Mayors of
Seattle and Plttsburg. He read the letter
from the Mayor of Seattle. In that epistle
the Seattle city executive wrote that it
was not in the power of any man, as ;hÂ»
world was constituted, to entirely abo'isli
gambling and prostitution. He had told
his constituents so when he was a candi
date for .election, and had also said to
them that If they expected their Mayor
to accomplish any sucn thing they wc>uM
do well to look for another man. If Christ
were on earth the evils could not be whol
ly eradicated. But every gambling hou.->e
In Seattle was put under surveillance .
There were no gambling games going on
in saloons. Prostitutes were compelled t>
pay a regular ftne whenever they were
arrested. There was no grafting goiiv.j
on. The fines for the past year collected
from gamblers and prostitutes approxi
mated 130.000.
Alayor Phelan answered a question
silked bv on* of the commission that ho
expected to collect' lines by the ordinary
machinery- of the law. I'nder the old sys
tem there were ugly stories of mear.3 t>
evade arrest. Under the present plan ev
ery offender was to be arrested. Ho sup
posed a large force of police would be
needed to do tho business. There were*
to be no exceptions. When this plan was
proposed the great Journals of light of
tfan Francisco, the daily papers, had been
consulted. Their proprietors, like practi
cal men. had said that It was a good
thing. There was one exception, tho
Morning Examiner, wh!ch had moral
scruples against gambling, but not thÂ«*
slightest sc-uple against prostitution.
The plan, he reiterated, was to arrest
every offender. Then these people coulil
ccme and make their resistance. No ono
had been sent to inquire whether they
would consent to the plan.
"I gave an authorized interview." said
the Mayor, "even to the Examiner. writ-
Ing it cut myself, that I might be correct
ly reported on that point."
"I have talked about the enforcement
of the law by the police. I suppose they
are enforcing It. If they do not I will be
called upon to net."
The Mayor acknowledged that an Inter
view purporting to bo had with him had
been correctly reported In the Examiner on
January 17. He then alluded to the caso
of "a man who was shaken down In the
Palace Hotel.,", as he expressed It anrt
who was made to give up money that did
not belong- to him. although there was no
process under which he was then held.
For this work he gave the credit to "an
attorney named Pillsbury," who advised
that that was the only practical way to
get anything.
The Mayor testified also that he was not
aware that any compromise had been
made under the present plan of procedure
against gamblers and prostitutes. He did
not believe that there had been any com
promise. . Â¦ - ' â¢
Commissioner Laird asked whether the
Chief had the power to make appoint-
He considered the Police Department to
be novr above reproach. He had heard
that certain parties were raising $2000 per
week for a corruption fund. If that was
true he would Ilka to know of it.

CHIEF OF POLICE WILLIAM
P. SULLIVAN JR. has forc-3
himself into a ir.ost compromising
and unfortunate position. He

Fomething which Captain Soymcur swore
v.as r.ot true, and Sulllvaa'a testlmonv,
given yesterday before the inquisltorp. has
been flatly contradicted by the Captain o'
Detectives.
â¢ Chief Sullivan's predicament pocmn
doubly strange from the fact that he ap
peared to bo telling what he knew with
transparent honesty. He sf>cme<l inclined
to disguise no circumstance of importance
nor to shield any one. hut the fact re
mains that his testimony shows him to b<?
l&mer.tably lacking in memory or one
who did not tell the truth. And stranger
still i? the fact that the incident of which
hf said he knew nothin;r had no material
â¢bearing on the primary purpose cf the in
vestigation.
While there was much of incidental in
t*rest in the general inquiry yesterday,
most attention Â¦was naturally given to
Chief of Police Sullivan, and the predica
ment in which voluntarily* he has placed
himself. The incidents which resulted in
his discomfiture are of ' moment While
Sergeant Mahoney was in charge of the
Chinatown squad Ho Yow, the Chin. *?c
Consul General, asked and received an in
terview with Captain Seymour of the Po
lite Department. â¢ ' -~
At that Interview Ho Tow told Captain
Seymour that four notorious Chinese

it to be his duty to inform the police for
their own protection, pledging Captain
Seymour to consider the interview a?
strictly confidential. Seymour promised
to do so. asking, however, that he be per
mitted to give the information to Chie'
Sullivan, also with the same limitation of
conf.der.ee.
When Chief Sullivan wes on the stand
yesterday he was a*ked if Captain Sey
mour had ever had a conversation of any
fort relating to Chinese Rambling with
him. Chief Sullivan <jfnic-d emphatically
and repeatedly that Seymour had ever
discussed the subject v.ith him. The r.amo
of Ho Yow was mentioned to refresh the
memory of the Chief. l#ut asain he denied
the alleged interview. Captain Seymour
then took the stand and after securing
permission from Ho Tow told the entire
conversation and added that he had re
lated to Chief of Police Sullivan all that
had been said. This start'ing contradic
tion of the testimony of Chief Sullivan
created the sensation ot the day.
Chief Sullivan was on the witness stand
during the .entire morning session and for
part of that of the afternoon. Ho was
much more self possessed yesterday thaii
on the previous day, but he seemed to be
more eagw to protect the officers of the
department than he had boon the day be
fore. He resented the slightest insinua
tion of thÂ« possibility of police corruption
in Chinatown, and when thÂ« investigators
led gently and gingerly tow.ird VYittman
Â«he Chief balked. He passed an unpleas
ant half hour in a discussion nf the prop
erty owned in Chinatown by Frank J. Sul
livan. Jjother-in-law of the Mayor, and
Ftumbled in trying to explain to Assem
blyman Laird why he had not enforced
the laws against gambling and the social
â¢evil which are now upon the statute
books.
He was then excused and the courtroom
rustled In anticipation when the name of
Mayor Phelan was called as the next wit
ness. His Honor was diplomatic, cau
tious, alert and sarcastic. He took his
customary fling at the newspapers and
committed the blunder of Chief Sullivan
in Baying- that the newspapers Indorsed
tho plan to license gamblers add social
outcasts. Ills Honor has evidently not
yet learned that hearsay testimony la
wort hJ ess.
He outlined the powers which the char
ter gives him over the Police Department
nnd made the remarkable assertion that
vhen he Insisted upon the election of Sul
livan as Chief of Police he knew of no
one In the department whose ability made
him an object of serious consideration foi
the place. Mayor Phelan also took occa
sion to denounce the Police Department as
corrupt before he assumed direction and
to praise it as pure since he has. He re
lated instances of Chinese cunning and
attempted bribery and offered various
huggeEtlons for the improvement of police
administration through it modification ol

A CAUSE OF HEADACHE.
One Very Common Cause, Generally
Overlooked.
Headache is a symptom, an Indication
of derangement or disease in some organ,
and the cause of the headache ia difficult
to locate because so many diseases have
headache as a prominent symptom: de-
rangement of the stomach and liver, heart
trouble, kidney disease, luns trouble, eye
strain or 111-nttlng glasses all produce
headaches, and If we could always locate
the organ which Is at fault the cure of
obstinate headaches would be a much
simpler matter.
However, for that form of heaaachn
called frontal headache, pain back of the
,eyes and in forehead, the cause is now
known to be catarrh of the head and
throat: when the headache Is located In
back of head and neck It Is often caused
from catarrh of the stomach or liver.
At any rate catarrh Is the most com-
mon cause or such headaches and thÂ«
cure of the catarrh causes a prompt dis-
appearance o? the heada"ches.
There Is at present no. treatment for
catarrh so convenient and effective as
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new Internal
remedy In tablet form, composed of anti-
septics like Eucalyptol. Gualacol and
Blood Root, which act upon the blood and
cause the elimination of the catarrhal poi-
son from the system through the natural
channels.
Miss Cora Alnsley, a prominent school
teacher in one of our normal schools,
speaks of her experience with catarrhal
headaches and eulogizes Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets as a cure for them. She says:
"I suffered daily from severe frontal
headache and pain in and back of the
eyes, at times so Intensely as to Incapa-
citate me In my dally duties. I had suf-
fered from catarrh more or less for years,
but never thought It Â¦was the cause of my
headaches, but finally became convinced
that such was the case, because the head-
aches were always worse whenever I had
a cold or fresh attack of catarrh-.
"Stuart's Catarrh Tablets were highly
recommended to me as a safe and pleas-
ant catarrh cure, and after using a few
BO-cent boxes which I procured from my
druggist. I was surprised and delighted
to find that both the catarrh and head-
aches had gone for. good."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are scld by
druggists at fifty cents per package, un-
der the guarantee of. the proprietors that
they contain absolutely no cocaine (found
In so many catarrh cures), no opium (so
common In cheap cough cures), nor any
harmful drug. They contain simply tho
wholesome antiseptics necessary to de-
stroy and drive from the system' tho
germs of catarrhal disease.

lating the practice of medicine and estab

ly the whole of the afternoon session of
the Senate to-day. Repeated attempts
to amend it were made, all of them fail
ing, and finally it was made a special or
tlÂ»-r for to-morrow.
Shortridge. Curtln. Simpson and Wolfe
led the opposition to the measure, while

The rhief contest came up on considera

Curtin moved to strike all of this out

tioa was a blow at personal liberty. It
would close all the mineral spring estab

MENTO, Feb. 6.â The mining bill, appro
priating $150,000 additional for the con
struction of the debris Impounding system.
on the Yuba River, came up In the As
sembly this morning on second reading.
Some unfriendly questions were asked,
which necessitated a defense of the bill
by Irish. It happened that Ralston was
In the chair. Ralston originally made
the fight against the bill during :Â»ts career
in committee, but agreed to withdraw ma
opposition in view of representations to
him at the meeting of the Miners Asso
ciation Saturday night that Colonel Heuer
of the Government engineers would rec
ommend to the Federal Government that
no money whatever be expended until tne
entire amount necessary for the con
struction of the system waa available.
Chandler expressed a fear that the
dams would not be permanently success
ful, but that In the course of twenty
years they would give way and the whole
of the impounded debris would be swept
down the rivers, devastating the valleys
and impeding navigation. *
Irish explained that the restraining
dam was to be of solid stone masonry,
built to last for ages. This dam would
catch the coarse debris and turn the cur
rent laden with light sediment into a
canal carrying It Into a settling basin en
tirely outside of the river basin. The
silt deposited in this settling basin, be
ing away from th<? river basin," would
never be carried down by floods or the
giving away of dams.
Carter asked whether it was reason
ably certain that hydraulic mining could
be resumed after the impounding system's
construction: also whether the bill were
for the benefit of the agriculturists or the
replied Irish, "that "it is
for the benefit of the entire State. In
my opinion within five years the increase
in the tax rolls in the hydraulic mining
district would return to the State in taxes
the entire $400,000 appropriated. A total
of $100,000,000 was invested in hydraulic
mines when they were closed down. The
mines became at once worthless. The
construction of the impounding system
will return these values to the list of tax
able property. It is a mistaken Idea that
the entire country of the hydraulic region
may be washed down into the valleys.
The mines are limited in area, just as
quartz mines are, and they probably win
be worked out within twenty years after
the resumption of work in them. We cer
tainly believe that the system JfiU be a
success, and that mining may be'resumett
and that agriculture and navigation will
be protected."
The report of the committee of the
whole that the bill pass was adopted
without a negative vote and the bill was
read a second time.
Ralston's bill reducing the salary of the
Debris Commissioner; from $3600 to $600
per year came up on second reading.
Ralston asserted" that for the past eight
years the. Debris Commissioner had had
no duties to perform other than drawing
his salary and that the State had paid to
him and his secretary $35,000. He ex
plained that when construction work
should begin on the debris impounding
system the Debrl3 Commissioner would
, have only" the duty of perfunctory' Inspec
tion and of signing the warrants drawn
against the State's -appropriation. For
this one day's work in every month he
would receive $50 under the new bill,
which the author and others considered
very liberal - compensation. '
Ex-Senator E. .C. Voorheis of A mad or,

SAN JOSE, Feb. 6.â In Frank Johnson
and George Hazel the Sheriff's office has
captured two desperate and experienced
crooks. Besides confessing to the burg
lary of the Mathewsoh residence on North
Ninth street, they, admitted under the
"sweating" process to-day to Sheriff
Langford that they had planned the rob
berv of the Commercial and Savings Bank
of this city. They had been in the city
a month, during which time they had
familiarized themselves with the. banks
premises at the corner of First and toun
tain streets. While these plans were ma
turing they committed no less than â¢ a
dozen burglaries, and the officers became
so close on their trail that they were
obliged to leave the city. Last Saturday
they were arrested at Watsonville by
Deputy Sheriff White. Since having been
brought here they have confessed to all
these crimes.
The plot of Johnson and Hazel to i rob
the Commercial and Savings Bank was a
daring one. They had learned that_ for
a few minutes during the noon hour
Cashier McGeoghegan was the sole official
at the bank. They had planned to enter
the bank at this time, engage the cashier
In conversation, and when his attention
was attracted one of .them was to cover
him with a revolver. The door of the
bank was then to.be closed and while one
held the cashier at bay the other was to
dump the money into saexs they had con
cealed about their persons. A buggy was
to be in waiting outside. The cashier
would then be gagged and placed in the
bank office. The robbers would carry
their bags of gold out to the buggy, climb
in and drive off into the hills, where the
booty would be cached. The. team would
then be returned to San Jose and tied on
the. streets.
Johnson and Hazel believed the plan
would be successful and intended to carry
it out had they not been compelled - to
leave because of the burglaries they com
mitted. As it was, they intended to.re
turn to commit the robbery. . -, Â¦
The men are believed to be' Eastern
crooks. They 'have been ' charged with
burglary, and pending their conviction an
attempt will be made to obtain their
records from the East.

VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. 6.â A peculiar
religious sect, the feature of whose singu
lar beliefs is based upon the eating of
peanuts as their principal article of food.
Is thriving in Vancouver, and throughout
British Columbia. There are 200 members
in the new church In Vancouver, and their
numbers ' are growing daily. Six months
ago the sect was first formed as a branch
of the Seventh Day Adventists, and now
it has gone so far as to erect mills equip
ped with machinery for the grinding and
manufacture of various kinds of food
from peanuts.
In abstract belief, one of the principal
opinions held by the new organization is
that Christ will appear on earth within a
few months and perhaps within only a
few weeks. They thereforÂ© wish to bo
prepared. In order that they may "shuffle
off this mortal coil" with no difficulty.
That they might be able to do this when,
the-tlme comes they made searching in
vestigation of the most healthful and pur
est foods, and came to the conclusion that
peanuts were the most proper diet. Their
leader, James Charman, who was former
ly a minister in the Adventist church, was
sent to New York, and there made a con
tract for a large weekly shipment of pea
nuts to Vancouver. Suitable works have
been' erected and equipped with | machin
ery, and now "all kinds of peanut products
are being turned out.
The peanuts are first boiled, and then,
ground into a meal, and- are used to make
nearly every kind of baked and cooked
dishes In which flour is ordinarily em
ployed/Brazil nuts and walnuts are used
by way -of variety, but these three con
stitute almost the entire means of sus

are making good headway. In- the conver

SEATTLE, Feb. 6.â A. M. Robinette, the
former Sacramentan, who confessed to
the police last night that he kidnaped
and murdered the 4-year-old child of Mrs.
Clara Kavanaugh because she deserted
him and married A. D. Colburn, was
taken before Chief of Police Meredith to
day and questioned. At first he was sul
len and refused to disclose what he had
done with the child. At last, however, he
admitted that he had not committed mur
der, but. refused to tell where the little
one was secreted. He was returned to his
cell, where he is still confined.
The police finally succeeded in locating
the child in a room on the third floor of
the Alhambra lodging-house. It appears
that Robinette had a room at the Ven
dome and also one at -the Alhambra. At
the latter place he locked up the child
and then went out on a spree.
Mrs. Colburn swore to a complaint to
day charging Robinette with kidnaping.
The case will come up to-morrow In the

CURIOS; .
1S4 KE.AJRJSnr ST."There has been a certain toleration of
Chinatown."
"With the indorsement of the whole of
S.an Francisco?"
"No. I wouldn't say that the whole com
munity was involved."
The final topic that the Mayor was
called upon to talk about was the slave
girls. He did rot know that the police
had been called upon to rescue slave girls.
He did not know whether the Police Com
missioners had discussed the rescue of
the slave pirls. The missionaries were
rescuing them and they did. not want to
be rescued.
Police Captain Seymour, when he was
placed on the stand, requested, after a
few preliminary questions, that he should
not bfc called uimn to testify to the sulj
r-tanre of a conversation that he had with
Ho Yow, the Chinese Consul General,
about Chinatown, until he could gain the
consent of the Chinese official, for he had
considered the matters talked of as con
llderulal. After pome urging Captain
Seymour was permitted to have his way
and he worked the telephone while he was
off tho stand to such effect that the Con
f=ul General consented that he should re
late their conversation.
This conversation, so Captain Seymour
said, took place in the Consular building.
He had had several talks with the Consul
General about Chinatown in the past
year. It was on December 20 or 21 that
the conversation concerning which he was
about to testify took place. Ho Yow told
him that Chung and San Jose Charley and
two other Chinamen, whose names he did
not know, were collecting .money In Chi
natown for the police. Ho Yow described
these Chinese as blackmailers.
"I don't know about the police getting
the money," said Ho Yow, "but that is
the story that they are telling, jand I
wanted to let you know."
There -was no further communication
then, so Captain Seymour testified, ex
cept that Ho Yow said: "I consider this
confidential. These loose stories about
Chinatown do harm and I do not want
them to get out."
The next day, so Captain Seymour testi
fied, or the day after that, he called upon
Chief Sullivan and told him about what
Ho Yow had said.
"Thjen you did tell the Chief about this
conversation?"
"Yes sir. I did."
Captain Seymour was then excused and
the 'inquiry was suspended until this
morning at 10 o'clock, when Mayor Phelan
will again take the witness stand.

called the jurors to order. District Attor
ney Byington was present and conducted
the examination of Chief Sullivan and
two other witnesses who. had been sub
penaed, D. H. Robert, a newspaper man,
and H. I. Torres. The fact that the Dis
trict Attorney Is the legal adviser of the
Police- Commissioners as well as the
Grand Jury did not interfere with the
proceedings, although one of the, grand
jurors raised the question.
After a short discussion II. I. Torres
was placed on the stand. Torres, who Is
employed by J. II. Barry in his news
paper ollice. is saic} to have played fantan
in Chinatown at the latter's solicitation,
in order to demonstrate that white men
are permitted to gamble in that locality.
Torres did not enlighten the Grand Jury
to any alarming extent, and Robert was
called to tell what he knew of the al
leged evidence discovered against tho
Police Department in having openly per
mitted gambling and other evils to flour
ish in Chinatown. Robert declined to
divulge the names of the informants, and
he was allowed to go after being before
the Grand Jury for less than ten minutes.
Chief Sullivan was the next witness and
was kept behind closed doors for over an
hour. Ho emerged therefrom with smil

not appear to be much perturbed. Neither
he nor the members of the Grand Jury
would tell the nature of the questions

.NEW YORK.' Feb. 6.â Th,e announce
ment this morning that Andrew Carnegie
had disposed of the control of the Car
negie Company to J. P. Morgan and his
associates attracted widespread attention*
among business men here to-day. Not
Only Wall street but the entlro commun
ity appeared deeply Interested in the
transactions with what the local news
papers denominate a "billion dollar steei
combine." It was tho all-absorbing topic
in â¢ brokers' oiTlces, and under persistent
repetitions of ihe report the stocks of the
leading steel companies made rapid and
violent advances.
As far as positive direct Information Is
concerned there was practically none to
be had to-day from Messrs. Morgan and
Carnegie, Mr. Morgan declining to con
firm or deny the report, while Mr. Carne
gie would make no statement whatever.
The fact, however, that these two mei*
permitted the reports to- continue in circu
lation without even attempting a denial
was generally regarded as a strong indi
cation that they were well founded, and
there was something, In the manner In
which the reports were put forward that
added to the general public's confidence In
their credibility. Numerous "semi-offi
cial" statements were put forward,, but
those could not be traced back to the
principals in the deal. .
- According to these reports J. P. Morgan
is afthe head of a svndlcate which con
templates the organization of a mammoth
steel combine to include the Federal Steel
Company, the National Steel Company,
the Steel Hoop Company, the Sheet Steel
Company, the American . Steel and "Wire
Company and the American Tin Plato
Company. The consensus of opinion among
bankers and brokers seems to be that
what Andrew Carnegie had really done
was to sign a contract to deliver his stock
holdings in the Carnegie Company to J. P.
Morgan & Co. , â¢
All statements as to the price to be paM
by Mr. Morgan and the men associated

Siegel in Town.
Mr. Siegel. the famous mandolin vir
tuoso, has arrived' In San Francisco and
is enjoying California's balmy climate.
Incidentally he is taking a much needed
rest after his extended northern concert
tcur, which, by the way, was the most
successful mandolin tour ever undertaken.
Mr. Siegel Is known throughout the East
as the finest maqdolin player the world
has known. San Francisco's musically
inclined people will spend a most enjoy
able evening Friday. February 8. at V.
M. C. A. Hall, listening to the sweet notes
from this very fine instrument in the
hands of an artist. Teachers throughout
the city are recommending their pupils
attending this musical feast, as it will be
of great benetit to them. While Mr. Siegel
is resting. Miss Mary Chester Williams
will render a vocal selection in her sweet
and charmins manner and she will be
followed by Mr. Harry Hastings, the
banjo player. The following programme
will be rendered: Part oneâ (a) "Fantaslo
Medley," unaccompanied (Arr. Siegel);
<b) "Cradle Song," duo (Hauser); (c)
"Reverie," unaccompanied; harmonics,
duo, duo with left hand pizzicato accom
paniment and arpeggio variations, violin
style (Siegel): (d) "Patrol." <.e> "Medley of
Popular Airs;" "Delight" (Luckstone),
Miss Mary Chester Williams; "Polish

ings. Part twoâ (a) "Cavalleria. Rusti
cana.". Intermezzo (Mascagni), <b> Fan
tasie," "Carmen" (Bizet), (c) "Melody in
F" (Rubinstein), (d) "Spring Flower
Gavotte" (Siegel), (e) "Witches' Dance"
(Siegel).
that in the spring of 1S99 there were very
positive rumors that the great Carnegie
inierests were to be transferred aiuiAhat
an option had actually been given by/ Mr.
Carnegie. Nevertheless, the deal fell
through. It Is claimed that H. C. Frick
and men associated with him actually
paid at that time $1,000,000 in cash to bind
the bargain, and that, falling to secure
the necessary capital. Mr. Carnegie prof
ited by this particular transaction to the
extent of $1,000,000. It" was claimed, by
these men that the purchase could havo
been effected at that time at a lower scale
of prices, and that $30,000,000 in cash only
would have been necessary, whereas a
considerably greater amount of capital
would be needed now.
On the other hand, Interests in "Wall
street friendly to air. Morgan called at
tention to the fact that conditions' have
materially changed In. the last two years;
that this is the day of big things, And
that the men now reported to be anxious
to secure control of the Carnegie interest
are vastly stronger in the world of finance
than the men who planned the great steel
combine two years ago.
All resorts seem to Indicate, however,
that Mr. Carnegie has obtained a higher
price for his stock than was indicated Jn
the proposed preat steel combination of
1899. Railroad and steel experts accounted
for this in two ways: First, that the price
of stocks In general and steel stocks in
particular had advanced during the two
years. Second, that Mr. Carnegie, hav
ing secured an independent railroad line
from his plants in Western Pennsylvania
to Lake Erie, and having undertaken
large operations in connection with the
town and harbor of Connaught. Ashtabula
County, Ohio, and halving planned an in
dependent railroad through Southern
Pennsylvania to tidewater as well, was in
a position to ask from the men associated
with J. Plerpont Morgan a higher price
than he could -have obtained two years
ago.- Â» r ' .

stated this afternoon that probably two
regiments of. State troops would be use-1
in case the step became necessary to pre
vent the fight. . The Third Regiment,
with headquarters at Day.ton, and the
Second, with headquarters at Lima, will
likely be those chosen, as it is not the

FLEISCHMANN ON THE STAND.
Says He Was Justified in Issuing
Permits for the Bout.
CINCINNATI. Feb. 6.â The second day
of the Jeffries-Ruhlln prize-fight cases in
court brought no indication as to when
the hearing would be concluded. The
State is making a most exhaustive effort
to show that the fights scheduled for this
city on February 15 would be a public
nuisance under the provision of the
Ohio law, and on that ground a perma
nent injunction is asked. The promoters
of the fight and their counsel are contest
ing every move made by the State and
claim to be hopeful of polling off the
boxing contesf under the permit of
Mayor Fleisehmann. notwithstanding
the radical action taken by Governc-
Nash and other State officials since las,.
Saturday, and especially to-day.
The sale of seats, the training at the
quarters of Jeffries. Ituhlin. Martin and
Chllds, the work of arranging boxes and
seats at the big hall and all other prep
arations for the event one week from Fri
day night have been proceeding to-day as
usual. It is evident that everything will
be completed and in readiness before a
decision by Judge Hollister can be ren
dered. The only suspension seems to be

Sichard Schwarz, Proprietor of Meat
Markst, Meets With. Fatal Ac
cident on Union Street.
Richard Schwarz, proprietor of the New
Golden Gate Valley Market at 1987 Union
street, near Buchanan, fractured his skull
by a fall in the street near his place of
business Tuesday evening and expired
a short time afterward. The ease was
investigated by Detective Tom Gibson
and the officer came to the conclusion
after a careful â¢ examination that the
butcher must have stumbled over a man
hole in the sidewalk and struck his head
against the sidyof the building. Schwarz
had just closea his shop and on. his person
was found $127. His account books, which
he had evidently started to carry home,
were lylne beside him. '
Soon after Schwarz had -fallen Joseph
Austin and John Degtrello found him ly
ing on the sidewalk and carried him to
the oftice of Dr. Giberson. near by. He
was sent from there to his home at 1SS0
Union street, .where he died at .g|:45 p. m.

COLUMBUS, Feb. 6.â At the re
quest of Governor Nash the
State Emergency Board to-day
authorized him to incur any
â¢ "expense necessary to prevent the
proposed Jeffries - Ruhlln prize-fight,
billed to take place in Saengerfest Hall,
Cincinnati, on February 15.
The request was granted by unani
mous vote of the finance committee,
chairmen of the two houses of the Gen
eral Assembly, the State Auditor and
the Governor.
It is possible that none of this will ba
needed in case the courts should enjoin
the fighters, and even If it becomes necs
sary to use the militia it will hardly be
necessary to call out more than one regi
ment, and tttat will not entail anything
like $3O,0fX> in expense.
The members of the board did not
know until they arrived here that they
were to be called upon to approve such
an expense. â¢ , iU _
This movement on the part of the Gov
ernor leaves no question as to his Inten
tion to use the military arm if the State
law falls to prevent the fight.
following 1* the Governor's letter ask
ing the emergency allowance: Â¦
"To the Emergency^ Board of Ohio-
Gentlemen: Whereas there is reasonable
apprehension that a body of men are act
ing together in the city of Cincinnati and
Hamilton County with the intent to com
mit a felony, to wit, bring off a prize
fight, and by force and violence to break
or resist the laws of the State, therefore
I respectfully ask your board to author
ize the adjutant general to create a de
iiclenvy for the transportation, subsis
tence, pay and general expenses of tho
Ohio National Guard in case It should be
come necessary to use them in preventing
the commission; of said felony and in
avoiding the breaking of said laws and
in overcoming resistance to the same
said deficiency not to exceed In amount

SchilHgâ Would It be possible to block

"I think so," answered the Mayor. "It

HO YOW AND HIS TALE
OF THE BLACKMAILER
Captain Seymour Confounds Chief
Sullivan and Contributes the
Sensation of the Session.
An Interview in the Examiner' was re
f<rred to. The Mayor 6sid that the alle
gation in that Interview that the China
town snuad had bocn bribed had had no
reference to the regime of the past year.
Hf> had no suspicion tha.t the" present
Chinatown equad had been bribed. If such
was the fact the remedy would be decapi
tation cf the offenders. With the excep
tion of the Chief. all the other officers of
the Police Department were irremovable
except for cause. The present. Chief, in
reorganizing the department, was asked
to make recommendations if. he found
t^ar.ces to be advisable. He made no sug
pestions for a change, but reported that
the department was working harmoni
ttusly. â¢ ...
Echffflg cskod v.'hether the Mayor had
knowledge that captains of police had let
the orders for rai<is get out before squads
moved.
The Mayor said that such action would
bo jÂ»ufncicnt cause for removal ; that it
would be in the nature of treason. No
complaints had come to the Mayor ask
ing lor the discipline cf any police officer.
Therefore he concluded that the people
were satisfied. The Chief of Police had
told him that he had no control over the
Chinese lottery dealers. lie could do
nothing with them except arrest them.
They had no respect 'for their word. He
did not believe that the police had any
moral effect in Chinatown. It .would l>e
a good thing to clear out thÂ« lottery
joints, for white men get In there surrep
titiously.
"Why haven't they been closed in the
past?" asked Schillig.

compense for what they, will lose In their

fuses to consider this side of the matter
at all. It will pay all actual expenses,
entertain the boxers most hospitably, but
that Is all. It appears that' Scholes, feath

money, something beyond the pale of

VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 6.â Americans
interested In Korean gold mining and
other Industrial projects are alleged to be
at the head of a plot to practically cause
the overthrow of the present Ministry of
Korea. Four high Ministers are charged
with treason at tho instigation of the
wealthy and adventurous Americans an-J
several officials of the present adminis
tration are likely to lose their hold in the
squabble: Japan has taken an active hand
in the' difficulty by demanding that th-?
four Ministers be dismissed en account of
their share In the ttlal. conviction- and
illegal execution of Ah and Kwong. whose
deaths last year created such a sensation
in Oriental politics.
The officials are L! In Yong. president
of the Seoul-Wljt Railway; Chang Pongh
wan. Chief Chamberlain: Aroer Sak and
I,u Fong Tu, Privy Councilors. The ac
cuser of the latter three was originally
Li In Yong, w-hosa name now Is at the
head of the list of alleged traitors.' LI is
especially charsed v/ith havlnp first been
in league with the executed fugitives from
Japan and to have then turned against
them and caused their ruin.
Various telegrams from Seoul say that
a political crisis is expected and there is
great excitement in the capital. The dis
patches say that the American clique is
undoubtedly at the back of the trouble,
as the Ministers accused belong to the
old and useless scnool Â¦ which is putting
every hindrance in the way of industrial
enterprises.

The bill as amended then was passed.
Aldrich of Rhode Island next called up
the war revenue reduction bill, and it was
read. He said no written report upon the
bill had been submitted, but he would ex
plain the committee's action after he had
perfected the measure.
The first amendment added to the
"promissory notes" (providing for the re
peal of the stamp tax on such instru
ments) the words "and any renewals
thereof."* _Â¦"â I 1 ' Â¦Â¦'- .'.-
The second modified the paragraph re
moving the stamp tax on bonds, making
it read as follows:
"Bonds of every description, not includ

the first paragraph of schedule A of said
act of bonds for indemnifying- any person

The next amendment Included "perfum

agreed to. as were other amendments as

hazing should be dismissed from the
academy and not bo eligible thereafter to

As agreed to, the hazing paragraph
reads as follows:
An amendment substituting an Income
tax for the war'revenue measure, offered
by Morgan of Alabama, was rejected by a
party vote, 21 to 38.
Beginning at 8 o'clock this evening the
first of a promised series of night sessions
was held to discuss the shipping bill. The
entire session was devoted to a continu
ous round of intellectual pyrotechnics.
Practically every question that has been,
or Is likely soon to be before the Senate,
was discussed, but very little time was
devoted to the pending measure." Notable
speeches were made by Jones of Arkansas
and Aldrich of Rhode Island. The Ar
kansas Senator was passionate In his de
nunciation of the methods of the majority
to force the shipping bill to an Issue and
Aldrlch's response was quite as keen and
vigorous in their defense. From a specta
cular point of view, the session was inter
esting, and. the sharp colloquies and snap
py speeches were hugely enjoyed by those
on the floor and by ' the large crowds In
the galleries.
Several bills were passed, including one
appropriating $50,000 for the preparation
of a site and the erection of a pedestal
for a statuo of the late Major General
George B. McClellan in Washington City,
and one authorizing- the Arizona Water
Company to construct a power plant on
the Pima-Indian Reservation, in Marlcopa
County. Arizona.
During the remainder of the afternoon
session the war revenue reduction bill was
before the Senate. A determined but un
succccssful effort was made to reduce Ihe
tax on bank checks and to provide that
telegraph and express companies should
bear the burden of the tax on messages
and packages sent. The Finance Com
mittee amendment, levying a tax on
transactions in so-called "bucket shops,"
modifying the tax on cigars and cigar
ettes and providing for a rebate on un
broken packages of tobacco, in addition- to
several others of a minor character, were
adopted.
WASHINGTON*. Feb. 6.â Two important
measures were disposed of by the Senate
to-day, the Military Academy appropria
tion bill and the war revenue reduction
measure. The former was under con
sideration less than an hour. The only
change made in it was the strengthening
of the provisions against hazing at West
Point. w 4Â». ; ;
At the night session practically no busi
ness was transacted. Arguments were
heard for. and against the necessity of
night sessions, pending legislation was
extraneously discussed and much petty
quibbling indulged In. At 11 o'clock the
Senate adjourned.
Allison offered an amendment exempting
from the tax levied upon life insurance
companies any post mortem assessment
association organized and conducted sole
ly for the members thereof, which was
agreed to. The bill was then passed with
out division. Â«
A committee amendment modifying the
tax on cigars and cigarettes In accordance
with tho proposition made previously by
Platt of Connecticut was agreed to.
The amendment of the committee fixing
the tax upon transactions In stocks
through so-called "bucket-shops" was
agreed to, with an amendment offered by
Mason providing that a tax of two cents
instead of one cent "on each one hun
dred dollars in value of the merchandise
covered or pretended to be covered."

been invalided home from time to time.
The transport's burden of soldiers con
tained those upon whom two and a half
years' of arduous toil and hardships in
the swamps and rice paddies had made
no Impression other than the browning of
skins and the hardening of muscles.
The Thirty-seventh Infantry enjoys the
distinction of having upon its company
rosters soldiers who are the pick of the
replments sent to Manila at the com
mencement of Ihe Spanish war. It was
organized in Manila from the men of the
Tennessee. Montana. Kansas and South
Dakota regiments, who preferred the $100
bounty .money, and the travel pay from
Manila to place of enlistment and the
chance of continued war to an earlier
return to their homes. One battalion is
made up of Tennesseans alone. Uncle
Sam's liberality has given the Thirty-sev
enth a reputation to be proud of.' It re
turns to this country the richest regiment
in the service. The paymaster has de
posited to the credit of the men more
than $150,000. a third of which sum is
owned by the men of Company D, Colonel
Cheatham. in speaking of the regiment
under his command.' paid:
"I would like to tell you of the splendid
behavior of my men. In every instance
where the officers have promised anything
on behalf of the regiment, the men were
as one in acting so as to enable the offi
cers to keep their word. The Thirty-sev
enth has since its organization bee"n a
source of- pride to the army. Company
after company, when given an opportuni
ty, has behaved in a manner worthy oC
such a gathering of American boys. Con
stantly in the field, they were enabled to
show "the stuff they were made of. and in
r.o single instance have they failed to 'get
what they went for.' General MacArthur,
in piving us our orders to return to oui
homes, complimented the regiment highly
on its splendid behavior.
"The amount of money In the hands of
the paymaster, credited to the men. is
proof that they have not wasted their
substance in riotous living, or in giving
their commanders cause for worry. When
the Sheridan landed at Nagasaki I gave
everv man permission to go ashore and
remain until a certain hour, and every
man answered to his name when the time
was up. They are all ashore now with
permission to" remain until 11 p. m.. and
every man jack of them will be back on
time/'

Individual judgment as to the merits of
Father Kruger's power to heal the sick
and larne is of little consequence com
pared with the assertions of thousands of
men. women and cnildren whom he has
treated arsd cured. He is a remarkable
man. hut he is not entitled to be classed
xviih the Sehlatters and other self-styled
messiahs who rose to eminence a year or
two p. go.
Fa:hÂ«=r Kruger's fame is spreading
throughout the United States. Some of
the subject? treated by him claim his
vovrrr to be divine, others say It is hyp
notic, ar.d again it is said to be magnetic.
As for Father Kruger. it is understood
that he docs not define his powers.
Father Krucer has been denounced as
a C'jack by physicians, but he continues
his work without Jot or hindrance. He
has b<"-en called twice to Rome, but each
time the Pope decided that the arraign
ment was baseiep^, and that there was
no cause for the Pontiff to interfere with
the work of the priest.
The records show that more than 6000
people have received treatment at his
hands during the last year. Many are
the stories told of Father Kruger's won
derful cures, which, for the most part,
seem to have been permanent ones. A
recital of some of the twentieth century
marvels performed by him would seem to
be incredible. Whatever may be said con
cerning Father Kruger. it cannot be
charged that he ministers to the fick and
r.ee-iy from selfish motives, for he makes
no char^Â» for his labors.
OMAHA. Feb. 6.â Adi-ices from Canova,
B. P.. tell of the wonderful cures of Fath
er Krcger, which in some instances ap
pear to be ali but miraculous. The trains
are laden with people bound for his parish
house, eager to subject themselves to his
rnlnistratior.?. The r"gn~age pf afflicted
people to this Mecca baa assumed enor
ir.o-js proportions and the present limited
hotel accommodations are overcrowded.-
Father Kruger's attempt to meet the de
mand by improvising a dormitory, or
rjuartcrs. for the pilgrims has given rise
to the impression that he is maintaining
a sanitarium.

\h\ at 40 Clementina street, disap-
IL^N peared from her home last Wed
nesday and no trace of rfer Has
since been discovered. The circumstances
surrounding the case seem to indicate that
the child was enticed from home.
The missing girl was a pupil in the
fourth grade of the JefEerson Grammar
School on Tehama street and on the day
of her disappearance she left school at
noon presumably to go to her dinner,
since which time she has not been seen.
The distracted parents, assisted by the
police, have assiduously searched for her
in this city and in Oakland, but without
success. It is thought by the police that
she is being concealed somewhere in Oak
land, as she h< reported, by one of her
companions as having said that she In
tended to visit across the bay.
The circumstance that led the police to
believe that she was enticed from home
is that she frequently had money In her
possession which was not given to her
by her parents. It is thought that those
who gave her this mon*y enticed her from
home.
Rose is described as being a comely
child, well developed and very bright
She was well treated at home and had
no cause to run away. The parents of
the child are recent arrivals from Gw
many and" she has no relatives in this
country.

The increase in the shipments by rail is particularly
gratifying, since it implies an increased demand in the
Eastern States for our wines." Those States ought
to furnish the best market in the world for wine, and
as soon as they are educated up to the use of table
wines they will undoubtedly do so. Taking all things
into consideration the outlook for. the wine industry
as a whole is distinctly good. There is a promise that
the dark days of the vineyardistand the win.emaket
are about over, and that from this time on' there will
be a steady improvement for at least some years to
come. . .
The Review says the facts of the increasing trade
are most strikingly noticeable in the records of the
exports of both dry and sweet wines, not only to do
mestic but to foreign markets. The grand totals of
shipment by sea were 7128 cases and 5,631,060 gal
lons. The figures do not include exports to Hawaii,
in which market it is known the trade has increased
It is pointed out that one of the surprising features
of the statistics is the great growth of shipments by
rail. It appears that during the fiscal year ending
June 3Â°. iooo. the total wine shipments from the State
by rail aggregated nearly 13,000,000 gallons and about
30,000 cases. Thus the shipments by rail and by sea
taken together. were in the neighborhood of 19,000,
000 gallons; and, as it is estimated that the demand
for wine for consumption on the Pacific Coast is not
less than 4,000,000 gallons annually, fully 23,000,000
gallons will' be required to meet, the demand each year
even if no further increase in demand takes place. '
Coming to details concerning various markets it 13
noted that New York took an increase of more than
1,000,000 gallons by sea; .China, Japan, Manila, took
double the number of cases and more than four times
the amount of bulk wine taken in 1898. There wa.s
also a strong growth in the demand from Central an.-i
South America, so that we seem at least to be getting
something like our proper share' of the wine trade of
the countries to the south of us.
PROM a review of the wine trade of the pasc
year given in the January number of the Pacific
Wine and Spirit Review it appears the year was
marked .by a considerable improvement in the trade
and that the prospects of the future are brighter "than
they have been for a long time past.

WINE STAINS ON LINENâ D. W.,
City. The following are methods used to
remove wine stains from linen: If the
stain be from claret or port wine, apply
table salt to the spot stained and moisten
with sherry. After washing no trace of
the stain will be r.een. The ncid contained
in claret decomposes the salt and sets free
chlorine (bleachlnp gas), which removes
the vegetable coloring of the wine. If the
stain is; from port, the addition of sherry
to the salt is essential. If the stain be
of long standing the spot should be rubbed
on each side with yellow soap, after which
there should be laid on the spot or stain
a thick mixture of starch dissolved in cold
water. This should be rubbed in well and
the cloth then exposed to the sun. If the
first attempt is not successful renew, the
process, and the stain, it is said, will dis
appear.

With the advancement made in all kinds of mechan
iirh for facilitating trade there should come, a lessen
ing of the burdens upon all classes of working.peo
ple. It is not right that any human being should be
compelledi'to pass nearly the whole of his wakeful
hours in earning the means of subsistence. Where.it
:s necessary for a business to be open nearly air the
time there should be a double set of employes. The
early closing movement is therefore a reform that ; j3
quite feasible, despite the difficulties that seemingly
stand in the way. Let the community as a whole give
In this, as in every other reform, there- will be of
course considerable difficulty in getting the general
agreement necessary to its success, and doubtless
some temporary disturbance of trade in carrying it
out even after agreement has been attained. The dis
turbance, however, will not be of long duration, and
in the end the reform, like those which have preceded
it, will be justified by the results.
From immemorial time there has been a proverb in
our language that all work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy. The common sense of our ancestors rec
ognized the need of recreation to the human brain.
The United States lost nothing in the efficiency of its
factory labor when the length of the working day was
reduced from the long hours that prevailed when the
factory system was first established. Neither vail the
mercantile activity of the city- lose anything by short
ening the hours of labor required of those engaged
in it.
Our needs are largely the result of our habits. We
are accustomed to have the shops open for a consid â¢
crable portion of the twenty-four hours, and because
we have that custom- we believe the long hours are
necessary to public convenience. If, however, we
should once succeed in bringing about a general prac
tice of earlj' closing public convenience, would soon
adapt itself to the new custom. Trade can be done
in regularly fixed hours in retail stores just as easily
as at Government, offices, factories or any other busi
ress where an hour is -established for closing. "As
soon as the people know they must do their shopping
within a given time it will be easy for them to do it.
There is nothing radical or revolutionary in the
movement. ..It is in line with the efforts long ago
made by mechanics and other bodies of organized la
bor to reduce the length of the working day and ob
tain for each individual a .portion of his time for re
creation and amusement There is no reason why a
reform which has been so beneficial to the members
of the trades would not be equally beneficial to the
employes of shops and stores of nearly if not quite
all kinds.
AMONG the many movements going on in .the
community for the improvement of social con
ditions and the promotion of the welfare oÂ£
working men and women none is deserving of a more
general sympathy and support than that known as
"the early closing movement," which has for its ob
ject the relief of employes in a large number of store?
and shops from the excessively long hours, that are
now required of them at their posts of duty.

PERSONAL MENTION.
W I^'GLED with the universal expression of re-
I \ sret an d utterance of sentiment proper to such
an occasion as the death of Victoria was the
hoarse bawling of the news faker, shouting, "I told it
Having built up a pseudo reputation as a newspaper
by faking, the Examiner and its combined associates
in New York and Chicago must sustain that reputa
tion by continuing to fake.
Exposure in such bald impostures as the pretended
interview with the Pope, the Queen of Spain and Mrs.
McKinley haÂ«. not admonished the Examiner style of
journalism, which substitutes invention for fact and
pretense for enterprise. A catalogue of the raw fakes
perpetrated upon the readers of the Journal, American
and Examiner would more than fill all the columns of
one edition of either paper. Both living and dead
had been used as advertising media, and so had ail
available objects, animate and inanimate. Even dis
ease,'as in its bubonic plague fake, was made use of
to secure notoriety and get an undeserved reputation
for enterprise. Perhaps the most laughable 'of all
these fakes was that in which Mr. Hearst himself was
used as material. When the National Bryan Clubs
met last fall in Indianapolis the Chicago American
printed a long account of the triumphal entry of Presi
dent Hearst, leaning on the arm of Chairman Jones,
while a hundred brass bands blew brazenly "Hail to
the Chief" and frantic thousands shouted until purple
in the face, while their veins stood out like whip
cords. The cold and clammy fact was that Mr.
Hearst was not there at all, nor was Chairman Jones,
nor the thousands, nor the shouts, nor the trombon
ing. It was all a gigantic fake.
Of course with such a record the death of the Queen
must be used for advertising purposes. Her last days
and the solemn close of her long life focused the at
tention of the v.-orld. Any item that carried her name
was sure to be read. So the Examiner intruded it
self upon the scene, yelling its merits as a getter of
news and asserting that it was the first to announce
her death. The Associated Press has thought the mat
ter of sufficient importance to be exposed, and has is
sued a complete refutation of the Examiner's claim
ar.d has proved it to have no foundation in truth, but
to have rested on a fake dispatch to the Archbishop
of Canterbury from. the death chamber, which was
never sent and never received. The Associated Press
proves beyond dispute that if any announcement of
the death were actually made in advance of that over
its wires it was made purposely and with the inten
tion of using it to claim priority of information and
superiority of enterprise.
But this complete exposure will not deter the same
papers from repeating the offense.
The people of every city are accustomed to such
advertising. If a military procession, a funeral or
other pageant pass down the street while thousands
3ook on, close to its rear always goes a wagon, hooded
with muslin and usc.d by the advertising faker, to call
attention to "Miss Fowler's floral fit preventer" or
"Mrs. Purley's patent parlor kidney f olish."
This -is the method followed and faithfully copied
by the Examiner.

H. BARTLETT LINDLEY, in Chicago Journal.
ON the Great Lakes, according to
the New York Press, has ap
â¢ peared a new style of lifeboat,
invented by Captain 3Iayo of
the life-saving service. He ha3
tested it himself and believes it to.be a
success. He has gone to Washington to
present the model of his invention for
the consideration of the Government. The
new lifeboat is really a sort of "life car,"
the principles being much the same as
those embodied in the latter device. The
life car is supposed to be hauled ashore
by lines, while the Mayo lifeboat is in
tended to be blown or rowed ashore, ac
cording to circumstances. A line of
steamers sailing out of Chicago has been
equipped with the Mayo boats, and the
captain and his associates are hopeful.
The newly devised boat is a cone, round
ed at both ends. It is intended to be
thirty feet long and seven feet in diame
ter. It is perfectly round, there being
projecting fins, or bilge keels, to keep it
from rolling. The shell is built of three
inch oak, covered with aluminum, or sheet
steel, as the builder desires, and is shaped
on strong: oak ribs on the inside. The
forward and after end of the boat are
air chambers, built in such a way that
crushing or puncturing are practically im
possible. Around the shell are openings
filled with heavy plate glass, set In rub
ber and steel gaskets. >= , ><.
On two sides are manholes set in the
same kind of gaskets, and on each -side
two portholes large enough to push an
oar through. The ports are closed with
heavy doors of steel and every opening
is closed and locked from the inside. The
only unprotected openings are at the ends
of the cone. The forward one is a man
hole large enough for a man to move
about in easHy, and at the other end is
an opening designed for the lowering of
an anchor. Inside there are accommoda
tions for fifty people ami lockers large
enough to Etow the food necessary for
their sustenance . for thirty days: also
water tanks with a supply of drinking
water sufficient to last for that time.
The seats are so arranged that they
revolve completely around, no matter how
often the boat turns over, and the pas
senger is always kept upright. The in
terior is fitted with two aluminum bulk
heads, which swing about with the mo
tion oX the seats inside the boat, always
keeping the ventilators a safe distance
above the water. To avoid the danger
of filling, the ends of the boat are. fitted
with wa<er vents, and as the whole boat,
loaded, draws less -than Tour inches there
is enough of it always exposed to the in
fluence of the wind to allow of its being
driven ashore. A device for locking thÂ«
swinging seats In position keeps them se
cure and allows rowing when rowing is
practicable.
SECTIONAL. VIEWS OF THE NEW LIFEBOAT DESIGNED BY CAPTAIN
MAYO, SHOWING INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR. REPRODUCED FROM
Fuller information will be given later on. In the
meantime those who have followed the course of
Home Circle Studies may be assured that the change
will mean progress and improvement, and the new
series will be even better than the old.
The Saturday papers will discuss "What the Gov
ernment Does for the People." They will be under
the supervision^of Dr. A. C. Trude, general director
of Government Agricultural Experiment Stations.
The papers will be worth a thorough study by all who
wish to understand the dealings of the Government
with the people. In fact, the course will be of in
terest for study in the higher grades of the public
schools as lessons in American politics and adminis
tration.
Â¦ The Wednesday course will be "The Women's Club
Movement," and will be in charge of Ellen M. Hen
rotin, ex-president of the General Federation of
Women's Clubs. Hardly any subject can be of more
interest to women than this, for the women's club
movement means something more than a social en
terprise. In it is involved almost every important
issue connected with the general subject of the im
provement of the condition of women and the pro
motio'n of all the great causes with which women are
particularly identified. ::â¢ '"
On Thursdays there will be a notable series of pa
pers and discussions on "The Art of Living ioo
Years." To that series a large number of emi
nent authorities on matters of health will contribute >
Among them will be such well-known men as D:.
George F. Shrady of New York, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell
of Philadelphia and Surgeon General Wyman of
Washington, D. C. ..'
The Friday papers will present "Pictures of Ameri
can Life a Century Ago." To that series many of the
best knofvn writers on American historical subjects
will contribute, and for the general reader it will be
one of the most fascinating of the whole. The life of
the people of this country a century ago was full of
picturesque features, and these will be depicted by
persons who are not enly familiar with the subject by
careful study but are skilled writers, capable of bring
ing out all that is interesting in the time.
The Tuesday articles will deal with '.'Colonial Gov
ernments of To-day,' fc and will be under the direction
of Professor Finley of Princeton. It hardly needs
to be pointed out that the course is pertinent to per
haps the most important political issue now before
the people of the United Statesâ that of providing for
the administration of affairs in the new possessions
that have come to us from the war with Spain. .
The articles to be published on Mondays will deal
with "The Opportunity and the Man." .The course
is to be conducted under the editorship of President
Draper of the University of Illinois, and will b'e con
cluded by an article by Senator Hoar of Massachu
setts. The series will prove of interest to all classes
of readers and will be of especial value to young men.
The Current Topics Club will consist of a. series of
papers giving information upon all sorts of matter*
of timely and general interest. The plan of the se
ries will be as .follows:
The change. from the Home Study Circle to Cur
rent Topics is due to the demand for progress in all
lines of work. The studies have found a large circle
of readers and have carried entertainment and in
struction to thousands. The public appreciation of
them has been highly gratifying. The change toa
new series is therefore due to no lack of interest 'in
the one now running, but solely. to the fact that by
experience with the home study papers more has been
learned of the popular needs for reading of that kind
than was known at first, and accordingly the" Cur
rent Topics Club has been undertaken for the pur
pose of improving upon the former series and pro
viding a course of reading which will appeal to an
even larger circle than the Home Studies while at
the same time proving equally interesting and in
structive.
UPON the close of the series of Home Studies
â¢now running in The Calljherc will begin an
other series, to be known as "The Current
Topics Club." The yapers of the new series will be
about the same length as those of the Home Study
Circle, and, like them, will be furnished by writers of
eminence in their several lines of work.

One of the discoveries from the lately
unearthed Babylonian records is to thÂ«
effect that in 2200 B. C. King Hammurabi
-discovered a case of official bribery and
ordered both the briber, the bribed and
the money taken into custody and brought
; before him. Another record discloses a
; case of usury and extortion for which the
â¢ same King ordered the punishment of the
usurer. This is referred to as a peculiar
evidence of the long standing of thesa
vices and an interesting evidence of the
way justice dealt with them. The rigor
of the ancient justice In suppressing such
vices may be surprising, although a cyni
cal view of it may be drawn from the
further statement that while the King
refused to touch the 400 ounces of gold
offered as a bribe and ordered it return^!
to the briber, he cannily rlireated that SM
ounces be first taken for legal expenses
and two ounces for fees to the servants.
But that in a primal stage bribery and
extortion were practiced i? neither new
nor surprising.â Pittsburg Dispatch.

âOmaha Bee.
What Tramps Cost.
We rejoice that Bishop Potter has raised his voice
for justice, and that the English Cardinal, Vaughan,
has also pleaded for honor and justice in a matter
which will long last as the odium of the Christian
world.
Shiploads of stolen property, looted from its own
ers, have been sent out of Chinese ports. There have
come into San Francisco hogsheads of costly finery,
belonging even to American ladies, consisting of silk
and ermine lined garments torn from the backs of
Chinese ladies, who were certainly as gentle as their
white sisters who are willing to wear them. Yet we
have not been at war with China, and there is lacking
the rude and brutal title written in warfare to the
personal effects of non-combatants.
We are glad that our Berkeley correspondent with
holds his approval from the cruel outrages that the
Western armies have perpetrated in China.
Having passed out of that phase of the relation of
government to religion as between themselves, hav
ing drenched Europe in blood to assert it before it
was abandoned, why should not Christendom apply
the wisdom it reached to its dealings with China?
Yet the Chinese treaties just to that extent subvert
civil government in China and grossly disturb the
equilibrium of that people.
" We insist that the civil governments of Christen
dom have no governmental mission to evangelize the
world. Neither they nor the sects agree upon what is
evangelical. Once ajfttnit the principle and the world
enters upoÂ« a turmoil that will never end. Shall Rus
sia say that, as she regards the Greek rite only as evan
gelical, she may use her power to enforce it against
the Latin rite, which is regarded as the sole evangeli
cal expression by Austria and Spain?
Another correspondent from Berkeley, who must
have overlooked the admission of the fact, disputes it,
or calls for proof. Our proof is in the English press
of Shanghai and Hongkong, and in the knowledge
that many American missionaries have of the transac
tion. Therefore it is rot necessary that we restate it.
We only ask that those who know thp interpolation
of the missionary clause to be a fact, and admit that it
was done, shall furnish us with another term than for
gery, in which to describe it. We have not objected
to missionary work in China, or elsewhere. But we
insist that such effort fhould be carried on without any
partnership with political government. Under treaties
that have been forced out of China her subjects be
coming converts in the missions cease to be subject to
her laws. They have the right to protection from the
country' whose Mag is over the mission tc which they
are attached. It is notorious" that" this has caused
Chinese lawbreakers to profess Christian conversion
as a means of avoiding punishment for their offenses.
Such treaties we regard as unwise. Their motive may
have been good, but their effect is extremely i evil.
Suppose that the Procestant powers, taking advantage
of Spain's weakness, ohould force her, a Catholic
power, to make the same agreement, putting her sub
jects beyond her control and giving them the protec
tion of the Government whose flag is over a Protes
tant mission when they profess Protestantism. In
such case would not the evil and injustice of it be
perfectly plain to the Christian world? Would it not
be plainly seen that missionary progress under such an
arrangement became a most dangerous subversion of
the civil government where it was carried. on?
The facts as we have stated them were admitted by
our missionary correspondent recently; who only ob
jected to the use of the term forgery, which he re
garded as a too harsh characterization of the act.
THE CALL is the only paper 'in the United
States that has developed' the facts concerning
the missionary clause in the Franco-Chinese
treaty of i860.

Mail Steamship Australia Brings Up
BACK FEOM TAHITI.
TWENTY-NINE shipwrecked sea
men arrived from Tahiti on the
Mail steamship Australia yester-.
day. They had several narrow
escapes and had it not been for the
assistance of the Pltcalrn Islanders some
of the men might have lost their lives. A3
the case stands, the British ship Pyrenees
is a total loss and her cargo of wheat and
barley, valued at about JaJ.OOO, has gone
up in smoke.
The Pyrenees left Puget Sound in Octo
ber last with a grain" cargo. She wa3
bound for Leith, Scotland, and when
Captain Bryce sailed out through tho
Straits of San Juan de Fuca he made hi3
course and thought everything looked like
fair sailing. For nearly a jiionth his best
hopes were realized. The vessel bowled
alons with a favoring breeze and all on
board looked forward to a quick run
home. Karly In the morning of Novem
ber 16 the carso was found to be afire and
the watch below was called. Captain
Bryce took in the situation at a glanco
and ordered steam in tho donkey
boiler. Water was pumped continuously
on the deck to keep the seams from open
ing.
When day broke Pitc.iirn Island loomed
up on the port bow. The British flag was
set union down and Captain Bryce headed
for the rocky shore. Intending to run his
ship on the beach. Captain McCoy, Gov
ernor of the island, however, put out In a
whaleboat and boarding the Pyreneees
advised running for the tJamblor
group and there beaching the ship.. Every
Btltcb of canvas was set and when Manga
Iteva Irlar.d was reached there were no
chances taken and no time lost In looking
for the opening in the coral reef. The
vessel piled up on the reef and the crew
pot ashore as quickly as possible. Luckily
the Pyrenees swung clear and of her own
accord drifted ashore and beached her
self. By this time her hold -was a fur
nace and it was not long before the deck
burst into flames. Soon after the sails
caught fire and then the masts went by
the board. When last seen the once clip
per Pyrenees was a broken-backed hulk
and the natives of Manga Reva were seek
ing her cooling hull for loot.

making additional wharf room * for the
fishermen was let to Healy, Tlbbetts &
Co. for $2353.. The matter of heating th>
ferry depot with oil instead of coal was
considered and the offer of Charles C.

ferred to the chief engineer. The E. K.
Wood Lumber Company was informed
that the question of tho wharf on the
south side of Channel street would be con
sidered. The company built the struc
ture, but the Commissioners own the land
and E. K. Wood wants to compromise.
Famsworth & Ruggles | want pay for a
horse and wagon that was run over on the
belt railroad. The matter was referred
to the yardmaster for a report.
The steamer South Portland is still un
der water. The" tug Relief Is at work
on her, but the chances of getting her
afloat seem remote. Whltelaw goes to
work on her to-morrow and expects to
have her alongside the wharf again by
Saturday.

The Kembles.
The period between Garrick's retirement i
and the dawn of the romantic school of j
acting is filled by the Kembles, the great- J
est family of actors that ever graced the j
English stage. A talent for acting is not J
uncommonly handed town from father to |
son, but in the cars of the Kembles there j
have, been five generations of actors.
Roger Kemble, the father of tb,e family, i
married In 1753 the daughter of a strolling ;
manager who had been an actor under I
Betterton. Of their twelve children eight I
reached maturity, and all of these made I
some appearance on the stage.
The first and greatest was Sarah, best
known as Mrs! Slddons. "the Tragic i
Muse." She was on the stage from her j
very cradle, married 'at 13 a handsome
young actor who boasted that he could I
play anything from Hamlet to Harlequin, j
and made some reputation in the prov- j
inces. before Garrlck invited her to join |
his company In London. Her first season j
with* him was anything but successful; j
Â¦she played Lady Anne to his Richard and j
was pronounced "lamentable." She was ;
forced to retire again into the prov
inces and to perfect herself In her art.
When she reappeared at the capital six j
years later It was to win an instant and j
overwhelming triumph. Her beautiful j
face and figure, her thrilling voice and
her complete absorption in her part,
showed her a tragic actress such a3 the
London stage Lad never seen before. It
was only gradually that she ventured en
Shakespearean loles. Isabella in "Meas
ure for Measure" was her first, and Con- |
stance in "King John" her second. But
her greatest part beycYid all question was
that of Lady Macbeth. Her performai.ee
of this character was pronounced perfect I
from beginning to end. The sleep-walk
inR scene, especially, she filled with such
a horror of remorse as to leave an indeli
ble impression on all who saw her.
Mrs. Slddons was essentially a tragic
actress; she was never successful in com
ic parts. Her great roles were those of
Lady Macbeth, Constance, Queen Kather
ine and Volumnla. She did not charm
so much as overwhelm,, and her worship
ers wee never weary of commemorating
the divine awe which she evoked. "She
was not loss than a goddess or an in
spired prophetess," says Hazlitt. This j
lofty manner of the stage she carried into j
private' life, and many stories are told
of her high tragedy airs toward servants
and strangers. "She reminds me, said
Washington Irving, "of the knights of
Branksome Hall â
""Who carved at the m<;al
With gloves of eteel,
And â¢drank the red wine through th* helmet
barr'd." N
Her brother. John Philip Kemble. was
probably her inferior in genius, butÂ»none
the less he was the greatest actor be
tween the retirement of Garrick and the |
llery dawn of Edmund Kean. Like his
lister he appeared on the hoards in ex
treme youth. His sister's great success
brought him to London, where he made
his debut in Hamlet. It was not an In
stant success-. Many found him hard and
cold; his harsh and tuneless voice dis
pleased those -who remembered the thrill
ing tones of Garrlck: but all admitted
that It was a great performance, studied,
thoughtful and filled with a certain high
nobility. Tliis, In fact, was the keynote
of Kemble's character as of his acting.
He was proud â vain even, his enemies
saidâ but he was a scholar and a gentle
man, and all that he did was nobly done.
His delivery was. In a sense, a return to
the artificial school which Garrlck- had
banished from the stage. Xot that he
ever fell into the old droning sing-song,
but in comparison with the natural liveli
ness of Garrick and the pas3ionate utter
ance of Kean there was always some
thing of the consciously elaborate in his
declamation. * â "
Little need be said of tae other mem
bers of the family. Stephen distinguished
himself by playing the part of Falstaff
without padding, probably the only actor
since Qutn capable of so appearing in the
part. Charles Kemble was called a first
rate actor of second-rato parts. His Hot
spur. Falconbrldge and Mercutio were
unrivaled. His daughter, Fanny Kemble.
carried on the tradition of the family till
well into the middle of the nineteenth cen
tury-
Three Great Players of the Nineteenth
Century.
Edmund Kean, who arose In the early
years of the nineteenth century to chal
lenge John Philip Kemble's undisputed
sovereignty of the tragic stage, was the
strongest possible contrast to that stately
and intelligent actor. The son of a stroll
ing actress, Kean had passed a youth of
incredible hardships. He tramped the
country with his mother, giving exhibi
tions at country fairs and in the public
rooms of village taverns. He lived off
turnips and cabbages in the fields. He
shipped as cabin boy to Madeira, Through
all nia trials he preserved the same
haughty and Indomitable spirit, am
bitious,- passionate and unrestrained.
AVhen an unknown actor in the provinces
he ran away to the Woods rather than
play Laertes to the Hamlet of Master
Betty, an infant phenomenon, of the day.
"I'll play second to no man in England
but John Kemble," he cried. The time
came when he was no longer to play sec
ond even to Kemble.
After many years of acting in the prov
inces he at last secured an engagement at
Drury Lane. For a lom? time, however,
he was not permitted â¢ to make his
debut. Ho insisted fiercely on 'appearing
as Shylock, and in spite of the opposi
tion of the manager and the sneers of the
company he gained his point. His debut
is one of tho moat remarkable events In
the history of the English stage. Un
known and friendless, playing to a cold
and critical audience, he simply took the
house by storm. No such first night had
been known in London since Garrick's
day. In Richard, his -next part, he chal
lenged comparison with Garrick himself.
"By Jove, he Is a soul!" 'wrote Lord
Byron on witnessing the performance.
"Life, nature, truth without exaggeration
or diminution. Kemble's Hamlet is per
fect, but Hamlet is not nature. Richard
Is a man and Kean is Richard."
He went on from triumph to triumph.
Hamlet was thought 4 to be Kemble's
greatest role, but Kean : s passionate emo
tion showed a thousand new* beauties in
the part. His Othello was said to have
been unequealed in the history of acting.
In Lear he had the courage to restore the
original fifth act of the play. Ions: super
seded on the stage by Tate's absurd
"happy ending." "No one knows what I
can-do till he sees me with Cordelia dead
In my arras," Kean said, and the effect he
produced upon his audience was utterly
beyond description. But perhaps his
greatest -Impersonation was that of Sir
Giles In "A New Way to Pay Old Debts."
Â¦ During the last scene ladies were carried
from the boxes in hysterics, Ix)rd Byron
fell into a fit of strong convulsions, and
the actress who was playing Lady All
worth fainted away on the stage.
But the very violence of passion which
made Kean so great was the means of hi*
destruction. Ho was unable to withstand
the temptations of his suddenly achieved,
success. He squanderea money like a
madman, setting his child to play with
piles of sovereigns and bundles of bank
notes, signing away huge sums to sharp
ers, drinking, reveling and playing all
manner of wild pranks. In America he
joined for a UmÂ« a band of Hurons, who
elected him their chief, and from whom
he was rescued by his friends on the
verge of insanity. He finally sank to .t
stage where it was !mDO9slble for him to
act except under the stimulus of heavy
doses of brandy. At :ast, at. the asre o"f
fifty, he broke down altogether. He was
playing Othello to his eon's Iagro. but In
the third act he fell forward upon hlj
son's- neck. "I am dying. Charlie: speak
to them for me." he whispered. Six weeks
later he passed away, muttering broken
phrases from his great Darts.
Kean's genius was limited to certain
parts, 1 but in these he was supreme. "To
see him act," -said Coleridge, "la like
reading Shakespeare bj flashes of light
ning." He had few physical qualifications,
a lowt and meager - figure, a dark, rrlm
countenance and a husky voice: but hla

amazing power of concentrated effort, ani
his boundless capacity of emotion, raised
him to the very highest pinnacle of his
art.
William Macready, the first of the srreat
actor-managers of the nineteenth century.
Is .hardly to be clas^e-1 along with Kean
and Kemble as an Interpreter of Shakes
peare. He had neither the passion of ttw
one nor the perfect art of the other. Buc
he wa3 an actor of vfrv srrent merit, de
voted to his art, thoughtful; studious,
sensitive and emotional. He made hi*
debut as a boy of seventeen as Romeo "at
Birmingham, and six years later won a
place for himself in London against 3ucn
rivals as Kean. Charles Kemble. Youss
# and the elder Booth, lie may be said t<>
have been eclectic In als acting, natura.,
classical, or romantic, according to thu
part he sustained. His great strength,
however, lay in his rtnderlnE of solemn
passion and of profound sorrow.
His first BQCCeaa was won In Richard.
In which he dared to challenge the hith
erto incomparable Kenn. So good a crit!-?
as L-eish Hunt held that, honors wero
evenly divided between them. If tn*> tw<>
performances could liave been combined,
he said, the result would have been per
fect. As he rose in reputation. Macready
uevoted himself to bntisirifj out- the !es-Â»
; known plays of Shakespeare. He revived
the second part of "Henry IV" and
achieved a great success in the role of
the world-worn kir.p. He brousrht "Henrv
V" once jnore u;>on the boards, and hi.-*
"King John" was considered one nt hi*
finest ports. He was a devoted student oT
Shakespeare, and. profoundly impressed
by Colt-ridge's famous tegturta, did all m
his power to discard the degraded acting
versions and restore "he true text of th<-Â»
poet to the stage. A thorough artist, sin
, cere and very much in earnest, he was a
favorite with the educated public, and
I counred amonjr his fritnda such m"n M
i Browning, Dickens. Bulwer. Talfourd and
] Tennyson. His voice waÂ« melodious and
of great power and flexibility, and hU
readings of plays were almost as fine Â«3
; his impersonations. He retired from th<*
I stage In 1251, appearing for the last timo
in his favorite parr of Macbeth.
It is tit and pleasant to close this sketch
of a great ciyn.isty of English actor3 with
the r.ame cf tht> American whose ances
try as well as his genius linked this coun
try to the motherland, and revived in thÂ«
New World the splendid traditions of
Shakespearean acting In the Old. Edwin
Booth, born at Beialr, Md.. In 1SH3. was
the son of Junius Hrutus Booth, the oUl
follower and one time rival of Edmund
Kean. The boy bf^an at an early ap:**
I to accompany his father on his theatrical
j tours, and at 1Â»J made his first appear-
I ance on the stase in the very minor chaj--
I aeter of Tressil in Clbber's version of
"Richard III." Before long he took thÂ«
part of Richard himself on an occaslo.i
when his father, quite .is noted for his ec
centricity as for his frenlus. declined at the
last moment to appear In this hi3 favorite
character. He underwent a long and try
ing novitiate on the Pacific Coast, whither
he had journeyed with hi* father shortly
after the discovery of gold in' California.
He was snowed up in little mountain
towns among the Sierras, learneokto know
| the pinch of poverty, fatigue and hun
ger, performed with his own hands tho
most mental offices of a theater, an 1
squandered tho resources of his art on
audiences that would have preferred
a comic song aiul a breakdown. But his
trials only served to enrich, purify and
heighten his character. There was little
of the "Bohemian in Edwin Booth, nothing
of the restless ambition or the wild de
bauchery of Kean. He had In early life
a hard battle with the vice of intemper
ance, inherited from his father, but ha
mastered it. and from that time till his
last day was ever the same simple, kindly,
honorable gentleman â with one exception,
perhaps, the best loved actor that has
ever trod the stage in thl.s country.
Booth returned to the East in 1S57 and
established himself at once as the con
tlnuator of the Shakespearian tradition in
this country. In a long engagement In
New York he acted Richard III. Shylock.
Lear. Romeo and Hamlet. In 1S83 he u>
dtrtook the management of the "Winter
Oarden Theater in New York, and in the
following winter brought out a splendid
performance of "Hamlet." which he play
ed for a hundred consecutive nights, a
record unparalleled In the history of tho
stage. t
It would serve no purpose here to go
into the detail of Booth's life. It was
devoted throughout to his art. He con
ducted for a time the noblest theater that
this country has ever seen. He traveled
throughout the land, spreading every
where a taste for the beautiful and the
Ideal in dramatic art: he visited England
and Germany and won from foreign audi
ences the most generous tributes of
praise. He lived to be the dean of the
profession In this country, the founder of
the Players' Club in New York, and the
revered and beloved friend and patron of
a younger generation of actors. No player
since the time of Betterton has occupied
the position that Edwin Booth held in hl3
last years.
Booth had nothing of the versatility of
Garrlck. and was happily devoid of that
craving for novelty which led Kean and
Kemble to waste their genius on trifling
parts. His roles were few In number, but
{ each was a finished and noble piece of
workmanship.
"The salient attributes of Booth s art.
says his biographer, "were Imagination,
insight, grace. Intense emotion and melan
choly refinement. The controlling at
tributeâthat which Imparted Individual
character, color and fascination to hl3
actingâ was the thoughtful introspective
habit of a stately mind, abstracted from
passion and suffused with a mournful
dreaminess cf temperament." His fine
person, his grave melancholy face, his
golden miracle nf a voice, all contributed
to make him an- Ideal poetic actor. But
his physical gifts shrank into Insignifi
cance when compared with that mental
superiority which lifted him so far above
the rank" and tile of players. Booth was
a modest and unassuming man. but he
never reeded to claim the first place on
any stage. It was conceded to him at
once as an Inherent right.
He was the finest Shakespearean actor,
with the possible exception of Kean. that
has ever been seen in America. He was
great as Shylock, Lear. Macbeth. Richard
and Iago, but greatest of all as Hamlet.
This was his own favorite part; he built
it up by long and careful study, and left
such an impression behind him that to
this day the figure of Shakespeare's prlncÂ«
is toSnany a mind completely identified
with that of Edwin Booth. "He seemed."
sÂ»ys Mr. "Winter, "to live Hamlet rather
than to act It." It was a most intellec
tual but at the same time a most poetic
and emotional interpretation. There
were few great "points'." In It, few of
Kean's lightning flashes, but a calm an<i
steady glow of sympathetic comprehen
sion. The princely grace and courtesy,
the brilliant wit. the dominant Intellec-
I tuality. and. above all, the vast and
brooding melancholy of Booth's Hamlet
can never be forjrotten by any one who
has had the good fortune to see that most
memorable display of the actor's art.
It may seem strange to close such a
study as this without a word of Sir Henry
Irving, the present great upholder of the
Shakespearean tradition. But he Is still
too near us to be properly judged. Hla
services to -the cause of the legitimate
drama have been very great; may fee Ions
be spared to render them.

NEW TOIIK. Feb. â¬.â The trading In stocks
end bonds to-day showed extraordinary volume
nr..I variety, the apgresate sales of all stock*
reaching 1.S94.200 Bhares.. compared with the
record of over 2.100.000 shares which .only ex
reeils then. The day's business In bonds wa*
also x-ery !Â«rs:e. but <JId not reach the level
Attained at various times In the bull market
of the spring of 1893. It must be bome in
ralnd also that the dealings In bonds are esti
mated according' to the par value of the ascuri
ties tmnFferred, and Â¦ the ' bonds which were
innst proÂ«ninent In the day's transactions were
low grade speculative bonds. In many cases
Â»Â»lHn*r at leas than naif their par value. The
demand for railroad bonds is nevertheless a.
very notable feature tn the current ma.rket and
the pressure of Investment funds Into these
â¢Â»m!-s,p*culatlve Â«*ctirHles had a great lnfju
Â«nc* on Fueculatlve rentrment In -. the stock
market. The day's market divided Itself quite
CHICAGO. Feb. 6.â The opening In the wheat
market was not cheerful. In the way of news
there was nothing, of moment save the fact
that Liverpool had declined agreeably | to the
example, set on this side yeeterday. - Outside
Interest was still undeveloped. \ This left .- the
generally bearish crowd to furnish a demand,
and they were in no .wise inclined to do this,
the liberality of . offerings Â¦ from 'commission
houses and individual longs resulting In heavi
ness early. May wheat, which opened lH@VÂ«c
lower at 74^4.t/7**Â»c. gradually worked Â¦ oft - to
74%c. The demand, Â¦ such as it was, "came al
moÂ«t entirely from shorts who took the oppor
tunity to secure profits. At the same time,
however, some of them Â¦ put: out other lines 1 on
the belief in -f till lower Agurea. for 'the' cereal.
Two recognire'd bulls bought moderately, .even
when the world's' visiblo increase announce
ment had caused "greater â¢ bearish ' confidence
among their neighbors in the pit. r Their buying
had much- to do in .steadying the. market at
74%c. 'It made the crowd nervous.;.' Attention
was called to the -statement' of Â¦ an Antwerp
ccÂ»reÂ«pondent that Â¦; Europe. waa dependent on
EASTERN MARKETS.
There was less activity In the oil stocks,
though business was very good nevertheless'
and quotations as a rule were steady to firm.
Giant Powder wa3 again the active stock on
the Bond Exchange, selling at $S5 30@85 in the
rnorninff and $S5*fS4 50 in thp afternoon. There

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON. Feb. 6.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
There is a continued improvement In the
movement of wool, but It has been at the ex
pense of prices, which have, been weak and
lower, except on a very few grades, such as
washed delaines and (juarterblood unwashed
combings. Some houses are willing to Fell at
lower prices than others, so that the market ia
to a considerable extent an Irregular and un
even one. but it Is possible to buy nearly all
grades of wool now at material concessions
from the prices ruling a month ago, and each
week sees some shading. In values, especially
on low Territories. Foreign wools, also, under
the influence of the depression existing abroad
and the disappointing course of the London
sales, are weak, and a considerable amount
of speculative wool carried over from 1S97 is
reported to have been disposed of in this mar
ket in the past week or ten days at a material
concession in price. The course of the goods
market thus far has been a slow one. The
present volume of orders is unsatisfactory in
size, but It is considered a healthy one. as the
clothing trade Is pursuing a very conservative
course, and such orders as they have given
are- not likely to be canceled. Taken alto
gether the situation is unsatisfactory, although
it is gratifying to know that a baals has at
length been reached on which manufacturers
are willing to operate when they need wool,
but there Is little satisfaction for the wool
merchants in doing business on the level of to
day's market.
The tales for the week In Bostpn amounted
to 3.114,340 pounds domestic and 823.000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 3.939,400 pounds,
against a total of 3.456.COO for the previous
week, and a total of 3.812,000 for the corre
sponding week last year. The sales since
January 1 amount to 13.534.400 pounds, against
21.421.6CO pounds for the corresponding time
last j'tar.

distinctly into three classes. The first was
comprised in the opening bulge in which the
violent competitive bidding due to the con
gestion of urgent buying orders over night
caused some sensational advances. Prices
promptly ran off on- profit-taking attracted by
this hiph level and the market yielded so,
easily that the bear traders made a vigorous
attack, causing some uther serious breaks in
prices. This- comprised the second cycle of
the market. When the selline mood had ex
hausted Itself traders began to he Impressed
with the character of some of the buying at
the decline. When the semi-annual dividend
on Heading first preferred was announced,
showing an increase- from ltÂ±. the previous
rate. tr> 2 per cent, the buying again tx-came
furiously active and a considerable short in
terest was driven precipitately to cover. This
comprised the: last cycle- in the market. .The
1 final recovery was bronen by frequent periods
of realizing, which continued In some cases
to the close, making the tone slightly irregu
lar at the last, though the undertone was
strong. The opening bulge was most pro
nounced in the swi stocks under the influence
of the growing belief in the plan to consolidate
all the great steel combinations. This billion- '
dollar consolidation is so stupendous In Its
proportions and offers such vast possibilities
for flotation of new securities as to dazzle the
, mort fertile speculative imagination. The cur
i rent belief in its accomplishment really un
derlay the whole speculative moment of the
cay. although there were other considerations
which supplemented it. The most conspicuous
movement* in" the steel stocks and the largest
transactions were In 1'ederal Steel and Steel
rnd Wire. Federal ?t=el rose 3*Â» and the pre
ferred 4'i. Pteel and Wire rose 3 and the pre- i
ferred 2. National Tube was up 3V and lie- :
public Steel preferred 4' 4 . ThÂ»re were consid
erable reactions in this- group, as well as in
the whole group after the opening bulge. The
selling toAake profits showed signs of urgency
at many points in the railroad list and some
of the leading stocks got from 1 to 2 points
un.lfr lust night. Thn.Â«e which have recently
advanced most strongly were weakest on the
decline. Pennsylvania, the coalers, the gran
gÂ«-rs the Southwestern, including Atchison
and Southern Pacific &nd Louisville, were all
conspicuously heavy. Some of them remained
comparatively heavy until the close, although
the late violent recovery in the Readings and
St.. Paul affected the members of their re
spective groups. rnlon Pacific yielded under
the effective profit-taking, but took a very
prominent part In the recovery, reaching a
level of VA over yesterday. Denver and Rio
Grande made a sensational advance of 5li and
the preferred 2U. while the other Colorado
stocks were affected to a lms degree on the
supposition that their amalgamation was con
templated, rail money again rose above the
recently current rate in the late dealings, but
without affecting the bullish enthusiasm. Xo
gold was engaged for export, which was not
a surprise In view of the downward" course of ,
foreign Interest rates and the general expecta- 1
tion that the rate of discount of the Bank of
England will be reduced to-morrow to be fol
lowed by like action by other foreign Govern
ment banks.

Dried Fruit in A'ot 1 York:
Mail reports from Â»w Tork say: "'There
Is tra.de, but It fs almost exclusively in
small lots, and at low prices. The better Job
bing demand for prunes, already noted, con
tinues, and feme houses report a very fair
business. Prices for prunes vary widely. Â«c
rordinj: to Quality of fruit and feeling of the
bolder.
"California raisins are easy. There were ru
ncrF of pales of 1000 boxes of S-crown yester
day around l\c. but tliis could nnt be con
firmed. Ps> of BW) boxes of 4-crown ru re
ported also, but the price was not learned. It
was believed to b* a round 6Hc. Some little
demand is noted for California Sultanas and
seeded raisins. Trices for the latter are in
buyers' favor.
"Currants are quiet. Local stock rti In
creased Xry the arrival of Â£50 barrels from Rot
terdam. Dates are in some request and Fllghtly
Bnaer. Prime evaporated apple* are dull, with
quotations nominal. Fancy and choice are firm
Â¦ nd in some demand. Grenoble walnuts are
wanted, and some business Is reported In Va-
Jer.cias."
Conditions in Wall Street.
,The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The nock market continues an enigma to the
average observer tnd eiiows an utter disregard
of all precedents. Activity haa been greatly
diminished and tome â¬florts were made to force
decline*, but with very limited success. At
the moment the public shows no disposition to
enlarge its purchases. The average outsider
hes made money during the last few months
and has either taken h'.t> profits and withdrawn
until lower prices or seme other inducements
tempt him to re-enter, or he is fo confident
of thÂ» future that he is content to -wait and
take the chances of rtill larger profits. Since
railroad earnlr.es are larger and general busi
ness irihf and there p.re fewer weak ac
counts open to attack than usual there seems
to hÂ» nothing In Fight to check the present
wave of optimism until the latter has spent
its force and begun to recede. When that
point will be reached i*. of course, beyond
human wisdom to determine. Just now the
outlook for a reaction is not very positive.
Prices M*m very high and good securities
scarce. Solid investments are rapidly settling
down to a SSS* per cent basis, and so Ion*
es money continues abundant we are not likely
to see any Important recessions, in the best
securities, u is the difficulty of finding Faf*
Â¦nd rrofhaMe employment for money that is
really underneath the present strength of the
market. Manipulation* and deals of various
torts are simply the levers by which prices
have been lifted. Th.?y could never have st
ttined the present high level but for the pro
longed period of cheap money, and until this
*jnderlyinR condition is changed we do not
look for any serious reaction in the stock mar
ket.
"Fcr the average outsider the market *t
present is a somewhat dangerous one; being
particularly dependent upon manipulations of
kÂ»t is more complete than usual by reason of
Â»he deals they can mak* or break es their in
terests prompt. The industrials are an element
Of uncertainty, the *p>'Â«-u!ation in this quarter
being le*f legitimate, fl uÂ«l while business con
tinues large in vnlume prices are declining and
the profits of 1900 are not likely to be repeated
In 1901. New competition is steadily increas
ing in the industrial* and the experiment of
putting: a lot of scattered establishments into
huge (ingle concerns has not by any means
proved a x>ermanent tu *<-esn.
"The money market continues easy and seems
likely to remain so. ur.til the April BHtlements
become a factor. Funds are plentiful and ship
ments of gold to Europe have started on a
Hbe.ral scale without causing any concern. The
fMtuatton In Kurope will be strengthened by
Thts movement, and once more New. York Is
rhowing Its ability t-j lend assistance to for
*i*cn money markets. Exports continue on a
large Â«?ale, while imports remain compara
tively stationary, and there are few signs of
Bttrope lc-Etenine her debt in the United
Fcalefc."

London Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
All business In the stock market here to-day
centered In An#rtcans, which were buoyant
and brisk throughout the session. Denver and
Rio Grande issues took the lead on two largÂ«
orders, the source of which could not be
traced, but the stock kept to the front and
held that position strongly all day. There was
some- talk of the line deriving benefits from
the Sou* hern-Union Pacific deal. New York
Bent early orders and was a stronger buyer,
especially In the bonds of the Wabash com
pany, about which there was some vague talk
of pendlnjr consoMdation. . Berlin continued to I
buy Canadian Pacific shares, although it is
not yet expected that the dividend will be in
creased. Union Pacific stocks seemed inclined
to go higher. The money market was about
steady, call loan rates remaining 3 pÂ«r cent.

SUMMARY 'OF THE MARKETS.
this country for the best part of its Imported
wheat, and that the lifelessness of Continental
markets could be removed by encouragement
from this side. As if in confirmation of these
assertions exporters at the decline began re

protect their operations made earlier and May
rallied to 74T4c, closing firm and unchanged at
that figure.
Corn enjoyed moderate activity within a nar
row range of pricee. May closed &c lower at
3S%c. â¢ >
Oats were - quiet but firm. May closed He

the atmosphere of the market heavy until Just

Senator Iiarela's object in introducing
the repolution was. as hp expressed It, to
atone for the action of the Victor mob In
assaulting Roosevelt during the campaign
last fall. He paid that Colorado could
phow her disapproval of mob rule in no
more fitting way than by extending of
ficial courtesies to Mr. Roosevelt. Senator
John A. Rush of Denver opposed the reso
lution in a violent speech. He declared
that Governor Roosevelt had come to
Colorado to "flaunt himself jn the. face of
his defeated political opponents." that he
had been killing game in violation of the
laws and that the Senate would be "stul
tifying Itself by Inviting him to address
It. "I object." he said, "to the Demo
cratic party bowing In apology for any
thing that occurred at Victor. I do not
believe In this body creating a Daniel and
thrusting him in a Routt County lion's
den, possibly to be devoured, while hunt
ing for tnis flamboyant Roosevelt."
The Senate was In an uproar in a mo
ment, cries of "Shame." greeting Rush
from all sides. After the noise had sub
sided the resolution was adopted, 25 to 4.
and Senator Farwcll (R.) was chosen the

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 5.â C. J. Stenzel
was to-day, held to answer for having ob
tained goods by false pretenses from J.
Dalporte, a bean grower in the Sacra
mento River district. It developed during
the examination that Stenzel visited Dal
porte at his ranch, and representing him
self as the agent of Crane & Co., a San
Francisco commission firm, induced Dal
porte to deliver to him his crop of beans
valued at upward of $2000. Stenzel shipped
the beans to San Francisco, sold them
and it is supposed "blew In" the proceeds
on the races.
Stenzel was regarded locally as some
thing of a protege of "Boss" Martin Kel
ly of San Francisco, and the latter was
present at his arraignment. Stenzel oneÂ©
backed James J. Corbett, the pugilist.- He
will have to stand trial before a Sacra
mento Jury for defrauding - Dalporte.

to-day of his candidacy for Mayor, as it
was expected he would. He declared that
he would run as an Independent without
an attempt to get any party behind him.
"I will make municipal ownership of

city of Oakland can be run on $1 and that
I can show the people that it can be
done."
The Republican City Central Committee
will hold a meeting to-morrow night at
which Its plan of campaign will be out
lined. It is proposed to make an aggres
sive fight with meetings In all parts of the
city and the liberal distribution of cam
paign literature. It is proposed to form
a general campaign committee, composed
of about 100 prominent Republicans who
are not candidates, and who were not con
nected with the convention that nomi
nated the candidates, and put them In
charge of the work. This will show the
j interest in the ticket taken by the party
in general.
The filling of the vacancy caused by the
resignation of "W. W. Childs of the nomi
nation for Councilman from the Second
Ward is not yet settled. The resignation
has been referred to Chairman Everett
Brown, who comes from the Second Ward.
The Second Ward delegation that nomi-

BERKELEY. Feb. 6.â The
announcement was made
to-day of the appointment
by the President of George
Schmidt as Postmaster, at
Berkeley, and with this announce
ment ends one of the big political
contests that have been waging in
the little college town.
Tho position of Postmaster of
Berkeley is particularly desirable,
for the salary is good compared
with the amount of responsibility
involved.? In this respect It Is
more, desirable than the Oakland
postoflice. This is due to the fact
that the University of California
makes large purchases of postage
stamps, and this keeps the Berke
ley postofflce in a higher class
than the population of the town
would otherwise Warrant.
The. struggle for this position is
always a determined .one in Berke
ley, and in this case there were
five candidatesâ George Schmidt.
A. K. Weir, J. M. Pierce. Pbilo
Mills and John M. Fox. Schmidt
secured the support of Congress
man Victor II. Metcalf, and this
gave him the coveted appointment.
George Schmidt Is a real estate
dealer, and has always been a
prominent factor in Berkeley poli
tics. He was once a candidate for
Town Marshal, but met defeat.
He served for a number of years
as Superintendent of Streets. Of
late he has devoted himself to his
real estate business. Mr. Schmidt
lives, with his family. at 2025 Uni
versity avenue. . '
The term of .Postmaster Ole C.
Vlnzent has expired, and the ap
pointment of Mr. Schmidt will
take effect as soon as he can pre
pare and file his bond and have
it approved. The red tape sur
rounding this act Is considerable,
and, will take some little: time.
McKinlay admits that he and Pardee
were at the place, but they declare that
Norn's story Â°f the assault is a fabrica
tion. According to McKinlay. he and Par
dee were passing tho shop and saw -Nom
standing In the doorway and made a de
mand for the costs. In law the costs
stand as a judgment against the China
man and his property is subject to a levy
by due process.
Chief of Police Hodgklns has begun an
independent investigation through Cap
tain of Police Wilson of the at-air.
That there was trouble between the
Mongolian and the policeman Is a fact, for
hundreds of people were attracted to his
shop about 2 o'clock this afternoon by the
lusty blowing of a police whistle, which was
being blown by a Chinese employe of the
lottery king. Norn was in his shop nurs
ing a "cauliflower" ear and holding a pis
tol from which he had fired a shot Into
the floor of his place, he said, to frighten
away the two policemen. McKinlay and
Pardee did not respond to the whistle's
blowing but slipped into an adjoining
blacksmith shop until the hubbub quieted.
Then both men hurried to the City Hall,
closely followed by Nora, who went. In
company with 1 his attorney, to the Police
Court, where he demanded McKlnlay's ar
rest.
The trouble, so the Chinaman claims,
arose from the demand of McKinlay that
Nora pay him $11 50. being a portion of
the costs of court In a recent suit brought
Bv Nona against the policeman. Nom sued
for damages, claiming that he had several
ribs broken by McKinlay. who had raided
his place in company with Pardee. The
Chinaman lost the case and the costs
;were adjudged against him.
Â¦ Nom says he was sitting In his shop this
afternoon when McKinlay, opening a
looked door with a skeleton key, entered
with Pardee and demanded the costs. The
Chinaman referred the policeman to his
â¢ attorney, T. F. Garrity.
'â¢Then McKinlay," said Nom to Deputy
! District Attorney Samuels, "called me a
1 bad name and punched me twice on the
i ear. My Chinaman, who saw the assault.
! ran out into the street, blowing a police,
I whistle, and as the policemen left I fireo.
I a shot Into the floor to make a noise and
get policemen there to protect me."
Patrolman Frank Lynch responded to
the whistling and took the pistol, which
Nom turned over to him. â¢ "
Application was made to-day to the
District Attorney by Gee Norn, the Chl
ese lottery king, for the arrest of Police
man Albert R. McKinlay. who Is accused
of having assaulted the Chinaman this
afternoon, after breaking into his shop
on Seventh street, near Broadway. The
accusing Chinaman claims that Policeman
Thomas Pardee was with McKinlay dur
ing the affray.- Deputy District Attorney
Samiiela began an inquiry at once, and
will decide to-morrow whether a com
plaint shall Issue against the accused pa
trolman. McKinlay denies, and is backed
in the denial by Pardee, that he struck
Gee Norn. The Chinaman exhibits a bad
ly swollen ear as a portion of his evi
dence in substantiation of his charges.

BERKKLET. Feb. Câ Th<Â» political sit
uation here la far from being without
complications. All nominees of the new
fusion party must file certificates as in
dependent candidates. That is the gen
eral opinion nor of those who havs
looked up the legal points of the 1 subject.
The old Non-Partisan and Independent
Taxpayers' parties had legal standing and
there would be no question about the po
sition of a nominee of either, but the
fusion of th> two has given a new party,
the Non-Partisan Taxpayers. This party
has of course never had the opportunity
to poll 3 per cent of the votes at an elec
tion and hence it does not exl3t legally.
It is also declared that the fact that no
primaries were held would make it unsafa
for a candidate to trust alone to the Non-
Partlsan Taxpayers' nomination.
Clerk M. L.' Hanscom. Assessor I. W.
Wells and Treasurer John Squires have
been visited by representatives from both
the Republicans and fusionists and of
fered renominatlon. As the fusionists
meet to-morrow night they will have tha

HIS Broadway, Feb. 6.
After working for more than a year on :
the testimony in the re-trial of the Oak
: land water front case. Judge Ogden has
' prepared his decision, which will be hand
ed down to-morrow morning. The opinion
covers the title of the city to such streets
as may be found to be open thorough
fares, in accordance with the lines laid
down by the, Supreme Court In the orig
inal decision of the case.
I Under that opinion the second trial was
ordered upon the theory that the city
was entitled to maintain title through the
water front property to all streets which
were open and dedicated in lSfiS. This was
the date when, the Supreme Court de-
I t-ided. title to the certain portions of
I the water front was vested by the city of
I Oakland in the Water Front Company.
The Supreme Court paid that the city,
under the Merritt compromise, had grant
ed to the Company all lands lying between
the line of ordinary high tide and low
i tide that was then within the corporate
limits of the city, and which extended
from the center line* of the north arrr. of
the estuary around to Twenty-second
street on the west shore. The decision
also gave to the Water Front Company
all lands which had been improved and
maintained. The strip covered by the
tide as far as the ship channel was de
clared to be under State title, excepting
such portions as might have beer sold as
tide lands by the State. - ~ ;
I The court left to the city Claim upon all
| streets that miRht have been open in 1S68,
j and the second trial was for the purpose
1 of determining what thoroughfares had
been dedicated, and can now be declared
open across the Water Front Company's
strip.
The question whether Broadway was
open will be dealt with in this decision.
The determination will have a bearing
upon the suits against the city now pend
ing'in the United States Circuit Court,
where the Water Front Company claimed
damages for the forcible opening of that
thoroughfare by former May.or Pardee.
Many of the streets now open to First
street, lying west of Broadway, will be
considered in the decision and all of the
streets from Broadway east to the north
arm of the estuary are involved. The
streets from Seventh north* to Twenty
second w'ere also Included during the sec
ond trial.
The decision covers twenty-four pages
of typewritten matter.

Boy cf 6 Lacks Teeth Until Fed
A llttl* chap f5x years old. the son of
W. Wells of Ravenswood. III., had, up to
a Ehort time ago. cut vÂ«_-ry few teeth. Nat-
urally the Imperfect mastication of food
caused Indigestion and a poorly nourished
ftystem. "When I fir.Â«t saw the lad," says
Rev. W. Osborne Stranahan of 3007 X.
Winchester Ave.. Ravenswood. he was
v.-ao ar.d pale, greatly emaciated, with im-
poverished b!ood, and Jacking all the es-
Frr.tials which go to make up robust
Mrrnpth and visor.
"Many remedies and different foods had
bern .tried, but none seemed to meet his
need. I kr.c-w somcth:r.s cf the value nf
Grape-Nuts food, and recommended ;ts
une. TJm first trial convinced the parents
cf one thing â at least they Jsad found a
food th* boy really liked. "He empties his
dish and calls for more.' the mothpr said.
"Astonishing results followed its use. al-
most immediately: Gcfii was rapidly put
on. the face, from being pallid and thin,
began to Cll out. the cheeks were plump
and rosy. The body, properly nourished,
began Its work of upbuilding- the system.
The most wonderful thine of all, the
Grape-Nuts food seemed to contain the
necessriry elements for the formation of
bor.e tissue, and presently the tardy teeth
began to erlck through.
~To-day the boy is strong and hearty. In
perfect health, with a full set of teeth
rapidly maturing. The Grape-Nuts food
alone has brought about this marvelous
result."THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, 7 FEBRUARY 7, is-ui.

Lyra, a relative of the President of Bra
zil, Dr. Campos Salles, was incarcerated
in an asylum for the Tisane to-dav after
committing a sacrilegious outrage In a
Roman Catholic church at Matlock Bath,
a bathing place two miles south of Mat
lock, in the County of Derby. Lyra sud
denly appeared in tho church during the
service, jumped over tbe altar rails and
attacked a statue of the Virgin Mary. A
priest seized the Intruder, who struggled
violently. Some time afterward he was
certified to being insane.

MANILA, Feb. 6.â Theodore Carranza,
r prominent and wealthy Spanish mer
chant and hemp and cocoanut buyer, was
arrested this afternoon charged with
furnishing supplies to aid the insurgents.
Carranza is also a partner of D. -M. Car
man, an American contractor and owner
of boats, who had considerable transpor
tation contracts with the Government.
The Provost Marshal and Secret -Service
officials have been watching a number of
merchants and transportation men Â¦ for
some time past. The police officials have
had a long interview with Carranza and
the arrest of several merchants Is expect
ed to result.
At the close of the interview between
the police and Carranza. the latter was
placed In continement. in the Andu-street
police stntion. Carman was arrested to
night and after considerable questioning
was sent to 'the same station. The men
are charged with the conducting of the
business of buying copra (the dried kernel
of the cocoanut broken up for export)
from insurgent presidents at Pagsan.ian,
in the eastern extremity of Laguna de Bai,
and also with paying assessments for tne
insurgent cause. The evidence adduced
to-night was to the effect that ths prison
ers have supplies of the striped clothing
used for insurgent uniforms. Both insur
gent prcsldentes who claim to have dealt
with Carranza and Carman are now Im
prisoned in Manila. One of them, Fabel
la, fears hanging because he was captured
fts an insurgent after having sworn al
legiance to the United "States. He made
strong statements intending to implicate
Carman and Carranza and confirming the
.statements of. Reich, who became presl
dente of Pagsnnjan after Fabella's arrest.
The police have letters and verbal state
ments from Carman, who sought Fabel
la's release, saying that he was a pat
riotic American subject. - According . to
papers found both the presidentes are
culpable Insurgents. Carranza and Car
man admit trading with the Insurgents,
but deny contributing to their cause or
furnishing them with supplies.
. Carman is one of the best known Ameri
cans in Manila. He has a monopoly of
carrying goods going through the Cus
tom-house ashore from the snips and has
made a great deal of money. He possessed
the confidence of General Otis.
Other Manila merchants are being In
vestigated.

TO KEEP A PUBLIC REGISTER
How Senator Corlett of Napa Proposes to Regulate the
Morals of -."Golonel" Brady's District. .
12
T1TB SAN FRANCTSCO CAI/L, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1901.
WHAT MAY HAPPEN SHOULD SENATOR CORLETT'S BILL REQUIRING- RESTAURANT-KEEPERS TO REGIS
TER THEIR GUESTS BECOME A LAW. THE CARICATURIST SHOWS THE WOES OF VARIOUS PEOPLE
WHO ARE INTERESTED AS THEY APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF THE HUMOROUS.
Section 1 provides for the keeping of a
register and that persons occupying rooms
which contain sleeping accommodations
must register their true names as occu
pants of such rooms.
Tho second section provides that the
police shall designate the public place for
keeping the register. It also gives to the
police and Deputy Sheriffs the right to
inspect the rooms at any time.
The third section provides that a res
taurant keeper who shall violate the law
may be fined $200 and sent to jail for
ninety days.
Section 4. adds degradations to the fine
and imprisonment by declaring that a
person convicted of violating this law
shall be deemed a dissolute and immoral
character and that his license shall be
forfeited. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
Old fashioned Democratic statesmen
such as General Thomas J. ClunJe, Ryland
Wallace, W. D. English and Major P.
J. Harvey would call the act "sumptuary
legislation." They all acknowledge that
they do not know exactly what sumptu
ary legislation means, but they do know
that a declaration in a party platform
against it catches the votes of all the non
partisans who like an occasional dinner
down town.
Apart from the political phase of the
proposed law "Colonel" Brady and his
associate statesmen, even if they are not
responsible for the Introduction of the
measure, may consult with the leading
restaurant keepers as to the adoption of
means to defeat the bill. The use of
money should be discountenanced at the
outset. ' A strong argument would be one
depicting the spectacle of the police in
vading one's private room In a swell res
taurant to ascertain if the persons at din
ner are other than those whose names are
on the register.
A mass meeting against sumptuary laws
drinks arÂ« sold or served, and providing for
the keeping of a register of names of occu
pants of such rooms, and the investigation,
inspection and examination of such register
and rooms by the police authorities and Sheriff
of the. place where such restaurants are lo
cated: and providing a penalty for the viola
tion of the condition of such regulations.

JANUARY'S DEAD
IN THE KLONDIKE
Perhaps the bill may refer to some
restaurant that Is not particular. The
Senator, however, asserts that he has
never had any personal experience with
such places, but he expresses the opinion
that tho bill is a good measure. Tt has
been referred to the Committee on Public
Morals, of which Senator Simpson of Los
Angeles is chairman. The Napa Senator
fancies that the committee will amend the
bill making it broader and more stringent.
Senator Corlett does not appear to be
an enthusiastic advocate of the regulat
ing measure. In an interview at Sacra
mtnto yesterday he said: "I Introduced
the restaurant registration bill at the re
quest of a man in San Francisco. I can
not tell you the name of the man who r.e
quested me to introduce It, but I can say
that the bill is not aimed at any par
ticular restaurant."
If this bill is permitted to go through
without remonstrance additional burdens
may be imposed. Four years hence Sen
ator Corlett's successor from Napa and
Lake may come down with a bill for an
electric illuminated register. The ulti
mate law may require the names to be
placed in brilliant letters on the house
top.
Should the pending bill become a law
despite all opposition. It would then be
time to consult the Police Commissioners
as to the best means for evading: or vio
lating it. In Colonel Brady's district
rights of registration are not strictly re
spected. In close political contests one
may voto the registered name of another,
hence in emergency John Smith might
sleep in a restaurant under the registered
name of. John Brown.
would not be out of order. 'The cooks and
waiters could engage Metropolitan Tem
ple, secure the services of the" Press Club
Quartet, and then invite the members
of the Pacific-Union. Bohemian. Uni
versity and San Francisco clubs to Join,
them in a remonstrance. Martin Kelly,
Colonel Brady and the Speaker should be
petitioned to discourage all attempts to
kill the registry bill by the use of money.
The battlecry should be. "We demand to
dino unmolestedâ to sleep unregistered."
Ho was taken to the. Receiving Hospital,
where he was treated by Doctors Bunnell
and Murphy.
Clancy waa working on a staircase, and
his duty was such that he was compelled
to make many trips from the second floor
to the basement. In order to expedite
matters and to save lfimself the labor of
running down so many steps, he utilized a
rope used for hoisting material. It was in
making one of these slides that the rope
broke. The unfortunate man owes his
life to the presence of a coil of rope, upon
which he fell, preventing his striking the
hard cement floor. . . .
"William Clancy, employed on the an
nex of the Claus Spreckels building, fell
sixty-five feet yesterday. Through the
breaking of a rope down which he was
sliding he was precipitated to the base
ment, sustaining a fracture of three ribs
and of the left hip joint, besides numerous
bruises. It Is also feared he Is Injured In

SENATOR CORLETTS bill, provid
ing that every restaurant shall
keep a register for guests, occa
sions some surprise, if not alarm.
In San. Francisco. As the Senator
hails from Napa Countv it Is assumed
that the chief object of the proposed new
law Is to preserve the moral character of
the restaurants In Xapa City, but as there
can be no special legislation under the
constitution that which* Is good for tho
Napa goose must likewise be good for the
San Francisco gander.
In this city several of the leading hlgh
class restaurants are in the Forty-third
Assembly District, a subdivision of the
commonwealth that happens to be repre
sented In the Legis.ature by Martin
Kelly's friend, "Colonel" Martin Brady.
Restaurant-keepers are wondering if Sen
ator Corlett Introduced the bill without |
soliciting the advice of tho "colonel." It
can hardly be credited that the Senator
from Napa Ignored the representative o*
tiie Forty-third In the preparation of th-i
measure. Such conduct en the part of
the Senator would cast the imputation
that "Colonel" Brady was not a fit per
son to supervise the morals of a restau
rant. In some of the swell restaurants in
"Colonel" Brady's legislative territory the
menu is long. It is a far cry from soup
to black coffee, considering the lnterme
diarv attractions pt the feast: nence it Is
not "uncommon for a statesman, bowed
under the weight of public cares, to re
cline between courses. Several of Colonel
Brady's constituents declare that it would
be a grievous hardship to compel a man
! to openly register in order to obtain a
| wink of sleep after dinner.
I The title of the proposed law will show
J the extent of the regulation which the
! Napa Senator would impose. Here Is the
! title, and he who engages a private room
â¢ in which to dine may beware: . â¢ â¢ ,
An act regulating the keeping of restaurants
to which are connected lodging rooms or rqpms
furnished with uleepinir accommodations. In
1 which meals, liquors, beer, wine or . other
A resolution was adopted which recites
that Mrs. M. Nolan, janltress of the Park
Primary SchooK having proved herself to
be unsatisfactory, -was dismissed.
Mrs. M. Johnson, Janltress of the Falr
rriount School, was transferred â¢ to the
Park Primary School.
Leaves of absence were granted to Miss
f/i rri tr h\ Norton. Margaret Bailie and
Miss M. C. Sutherland.
Miss E. J. Sullivan was assigned to a
Â¦ new class In the Grant School and Miss
j A. E. Cookson was transferred from the
j Cooper to the Grant School to relieve the
I principal. Miss Ida Shaw, who, now that
j there are eight classes In the school, will
not have to teach. Miss I. Hainmingway
was placed on the substitute list.
The spring vacation was fixed for the
j week beginning on March 25, 1901.
Mrs. M. E. Maguire. having returned
from a. three years' leave of absence, was
placed at the foot of the unassigned list.
The sum of $25 per month additional In
payment for extra work in the French
department of the Polytechnic High
School was given to E. J. Dupuy from
I February 1, 1901. . ""Â»
"There is only one way to deal with
men of Webster's caliber." said Casserly,
"and that Is to give them a nose pulling.
Only the fear of getting my picture in the
papers deters me from administering a
casTigatlon which he well deserves."
Casserly then went on to tell of the
fruitless efforts made by the messenger of
the board to find Webster. After tho
meeting had adjourned, Casserly, who. by
this time had become greatly excited,
launched out into a tirade against the
absent Superintendent.
I rise for the purpose of contradicting cer
tain published statements made by Superin
tendent Webster, about me. I hereby brand
every one of said statements as a malicious
and absolute lie. I have no terms strong
enough in which to couch my denial of these
unmitigated falsehoods. I had hoped that the
Superintendent would be prcsent'when I made
this statement and I used every effort to se
cure his presence. Immediately upon reading
the statements I went to his lodgings and,
falling to find him. left there a card, stating
that I had called In reference to the lies about
me. These false statements are in line with
others equally false, emanating from the Su
i*crintendent's office in reference to thi3 board
and its members. ' ' Â¦
The only Incident which marred the gen
erally dignified proceedings of the Board
of Education occurred at yesterday's
meeting when Director Casserly in a, ver
bal statement passed the lie to Superin
tendent of Schools Webster. Casserly
took vigorous exceptions to Webster mak
ing public the fact that the last named
had held up a bill for hack hire incurred
by the board In visiting schools. The Di
rector's ebullition was caused mainly by
the fact that Webster had singled him
out as the only one Â¦who had used the
hack. Webster was not present at the
meeting, it being reported that he was
ill at his home. Immediately preceding
adjournment Casserly addressed the board
as fallows; ;

In the evening more than 200 gentlemen
prominent In the tire Insurance business
gathered in the Maple roonvof the Palace
Hotel to partake of the annual banquet
of the Fire Underwriters* Association. A
number of distinguished guests were
present. Including President Jordan of
Stanford University. President Wheeler
of the University of California. Mayor
Phelan. Deputy Commissioner of Insur
ance Shively of Washington. ex-Deputy
Commissioner Helfner of Washington
Mr. Lane of Denver and H. J. Grant of
Salt Lake City.
Frank J. Devlin, the retiring president
of the association, was In the chair, and
was supported by the Invited guests and
his successor. George W. Dornin. Durinjr
the dinner the assemblage waa In the
best of spirits, joining In the popular airs
played by the orchestra. It was almost
10 p. m. when the speechmaklng com
menced President DeVlln make a short
but pointed address, in which he thanked
all present for. their support during his
year of office. Speeches were made by
Presidents Jordan and Wheeler of the
universities. Mayor Phelan. W. J. Dutton
Rhiyely E. G. Ileifner. George D. Dornin.
E. W. Carpenter and Max Berteau.
The reading of "The California Knap
sack" by George P, Grant and Colonel
KInney was provocative of the heartiest
laughter. "The I Knapsack" consists . of
amusing incidents and anecdotes supplied
by members of the organization, many of
the reminiscences being from actual ex
perience.
Colonel KInney read a humorous paper
entitled "From the Northwest," prepared
by J. W. Gunn of Portland, Oregon, and
Harry W. Kores discussed "Methods and
Results." Mr. Fores deprecated the ratÂ»
war of 1S95 and the annual scramble for
growing grain Insurance. He claimed that
insurance men should conduct their busi
ness 'with the same dignity as marked the
methods of banking men.
"A Reinsurance Controversy" was tho
subject- of a paper edited by W. il.
Speyer and read by E. B. de Golla, It
dealt with the Insurance of certain prop
erty by one company and Its reinsurance
with other organizations. "Some Re
marks on the Shingle Mill Question," pre
pared by LÂ» \V. Knight, were read by
Mr. Folger. He showed the danger from
fires In the shingle mills of the Pacific
Coast and pleaded for a uniform system
of building and maintenance o* these con
cerns.
At the morning session an able paper
on "Settlement of Losses Under General
Form Insurance" was read by F. B. Kel
lam. "A Long Felt Want" was the sub
ject of a humorous paper by James A.
Carey. Robert H. Delaneld read a paper
on "Wine Cellars as a Klre Hazard. Ho
declared that more rigid inspection and
rules governing the building of wine cel
lars should be established.
The annual meeting of the Fire Under
writers' Association of the Pacific was
brought to a conclusion with the morning
and afternoon sessions held yesterday at
the headquarters, 303 California street.

ebrated Duke of Argyl. This handsome building has been designed
and constructed by Mr. S. L. Sly. It Is the last one of. the many
buildings erected by him during the last few years. It is modern in
every respect; fireproof, electric elevator; absolutely the finest and
