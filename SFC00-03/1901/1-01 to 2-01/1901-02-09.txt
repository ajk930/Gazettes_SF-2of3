eral passengers, two of â¢whom are in a ter
rible condition from exposure and acci
dents In the Cook Inlet country. Contrary
to expectations, the Bertha did not bring
any Nome passengers, but reports that
there are probably twenty-five of the resi
dents of the big gold camp waiting at
Iliama Bay for transportation to Seattle.
A boat had been sent for them, but the
Bertha left Kadiak on January 27, before
they had time to arrive., â¢ -
The passengers and crew of the Bertha
are delighted to reach civilization in
safety/ They experienced the- roughest
weather on record, and. would- not have
"been surprised any "moment if the stanch
crafrhad :been" crushed Ifrth'e ice' floes or
thrown a helpless mass on the barren and
ro f k y, shores of a desolate coast.. Captain
Johnson said: "The weather was the most
terrific I ever encountered."
i Not only did the Bertha have to fight
the elements on her trip north, but also
coming south as .'well. There was hardly
any let up. The weather was very cold
â¢all the time, the thermometer averaging
10 degrees belo^ zero at the water/ s edge.
On January S6 there was a terrific storm
and the Bertha had all she could do to
keep off the shore. Two anchor? were
thrown out. and with engines working at
the full capacity the steamer headed for
the open sea. Then she struck the ice
floe? and was In danger of being crushed.
The huge waves would throw the ice
against the boat with great force, threat
ening to not only crush but swamp her.
During the critical time one of the pro
peller blades was lost. This compelled the
beaching of the steamer.
Among the passengers was C. A. Lind
blat, who tells a story of privation and
suffering that would sicken the hardest
heart. Sunrise City had been without
mallfor a long, time and Llndblat volun
teered to go to Resurrection Bay, 30C
miles away over a "desolate and unhosplt- '

able trail. Llndblat had the misfortune In
crossing a small stream to fall Into the
water. "Without thinking of the conse
quences he removed his mittens in order
to wring the water from his clothing. In
less than a minute his hands had frozen
stiff. That night his hands pained him a
great deal more. After that It was a
series of hardships he will never forget
The road was hard to travel and his
hands being almost useless, he could
hardly, prepare his meals.
Somehow the next few days passed and
he reached Resurrection Bay after twelve
â¢days of hard traveling, a week of whlc 1 !
was nearly unendurable from pain. On,
arriving at Resurrection Bay, finding
there was no mail, he sent word back t-i
Sunrise and took the Bertha; which was
In port, to Valdes in hope of getting hia
hands attended to.
,1'This trip was useless," he continued,
"for the army post hospital at that place
said it was against regulations and re
fused to take me In. By this time the
condition of my. hands was something
awful, they pained me night and day. I
returned to the Bertha, and with the help
of several friends did the best I could for
my hands and came to Seattle. I guess
I .will lose both. It is barely possible,
however, that I will only lose several
fingers, but there is not much hope."
Lindblat Is a native of Buffalo. N. T.,
and It Is understood has returned almost
penniless. - He is. a man of excellent
physique and has a strong constitution,
which Is probably all that kept him from
giving up "in absolute despair and dying
on the trail.
The case of Peter Ol3en Is remarkable.
Last summer he went north to prospect
for gold In the Cook Inlet country. His
efforts meeting with' little success he
sought employment as a grader with the
Cook Inlet Coal Field Company on a
railroad seven" miles long.' extending from
HomerJ In the inlet, to the company's coal
mines. September 27 while riding on the
engine he became entangled in thÂ« draw
bar between the engine aml-the first car.
He was caught In such a manner as to
have nearly all of the flesh torn from the
left leg from a point midway between the
body and the knee to the foot. While the
bones were not broken the limb was
frightfully tofn and lacerated, the bones
being laid bare In many places. It was
nearly two weeks later. October 8, before
the sufferer could have a surgical opera
tion performed, and a rude operation it
was. Dr. Bemist for his surgical Instru
ments had only a carpenter's saw, an
ordinary butcher knife and a chisel. With
; only these tools Dr. Bemist. who Is the
Cook Inlet Coal Fields Company's sur
geon, amputated the leg half way above
the knee. Strange to say. Olsen came
from under the chloroform used In re
markably good condition. Olsen blames
no one in particular for his misfortune.
He is a poor man.
"I have about enough money to buy me
a cork leg," he said, "When I. get the
leg I will have nothing left. I came to
Seattle for It."
Olsen is about 36 years of age. He has
but one relative, a cousin, Pete Peterson

States.

tiraln. dying almost Instantly. The
voman, shot through the heart, lived
only long enough to reach the Receiving
Hospital, two blocks distant.
Seely arrived In San Francisco from
Portland Thursday, accompanied by his
nephew, -C. W. Garletz. They came to
f nd Mrs. Seely. She was finally located
yesterday by Garletz. and 'last evening
the nephew pointed out to Seely the resi
dence of Mrs. Seely in Oakland In the
lower flat of a email cottage. Seely en
tered the house, while Garletz waited on
m. stre<t corner.
The railroad man found his wife en
tertaining Sidney Wilson, a. Pullman Car
Co-npary conductor. After some words
snout their child he pulled a pistol and

Wilson and the upstairs tenant. E. B.

flood behind the door. They got her to
1h* hoypltal. Garletz joined the crowd
that gathered at the scene of the shoot
lnjf. JTe Insisted that he did not know his
ur.cl* Intended to kill Mrs. Seely.
Conductor Wilson, who has known Mrs.
Peely f!n<-e last December, tells the fol-
Jf Ing story: "I Â¦was alone in the house
with Mrs. Seely when Seely called. She
turned to introduce me and he said: 'No.
you can't shake hands with me.' I saw 1

when h* said: 'Wait a mir"'.e. I want to

as I put vr> my hand to expostulate he
pulled out a pistol, and I ran out. fol
lowed by Mrs. Seely. As I got outside the
floor I heard the shooting and then I
ye'ilpd for help.
"Before that trouble began Seely asked
Â¦where the child was. Mrs. Seely said the
girl was at a private pchool at Mission
San Jose. That ansered him. He knew
me. because once I had protected his wife
rm a trr.in at Portland from him."
The search for the child was due to
Mrs. Seely's action, after she left Seely
last August. In returning to Portland in
f t member, pecuring the girl and coming
hack to California. There was a fight on
the train between Seely, who had followed
his wife, and he was prevented by the
passengers from recovering the girl.
Wilson had met Mr?. Soely when she
â¢went to Portland to get the child, and
their acquaintance dates from that time.
He protests that there was nothing but
friendship existing between them. He at
tributes Seely's anger to recollection of
the incident at Portland. Mrs. Seely had
been keeping house for her brother. W. H.
Drummond, a motorman on the Alameda
division of the Oakland Transit Compa
ny's road. He said last night:
"I expected this thing. The last thing I
raI2 to my sister when I left home to go
to work at 3 o'clock was, 'Now, Mary,
look out. Frank Is meditating some dev
iltry/ This morning a letter came from
Seely. dated at Portland on the â¬th. that
he was to leave that night for Baker City.
V."hÂ«Â»n Mary read me the letter I said,
'That looks eusplclous. I don't believe he
is going to Baker City.* Another thing
which rr.aCe me believe a plot was on foot
â¢was the fact that Garletz, . Frank's
rif-pnew, whom we had never seen before,

to look us up on a friendly errand. I told
Seely was 43 years old. a native of Illi
nois. He has two sons by a former mar
riage residing In Portland. He was for
years a railroad conductor, later a Wells,
Fargo & Co. messenger on the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation road from Port
land to Astoria. Two years ago he lost
a leg in- an accident and had to retire.
Mrs. Seely's parents are Mr. and Mrs. J.
H. Drummond, residents oi Cloverdale. a
suburb of Portland. A sister. Mrs. D. B.
Ladd, resides at San Jcse. The Coroner
has charge of the case, having removed
both bodies to the Morgue.
E. B/ Southard, who occupies the upper
flat of the cottage, heard the shots,
rushed out his front door and downstairs.
He heard Wilson cry that Mrs. Seely had
been shot: Harry Asher saw Seely run
down the alleyway alongside of the house
with a pistol In his hand, but did not fol
low him.
"I heard Seely and his wife talking out
side the door before they came In and
f=he told him who was there." explained
Wilson. "Drummond and I have often
heard her expres3 fears he would kill
her."
Wilson said he did not think Seely
recognized him, but he believes the hus
band would have killed him if he had
not left the house.
"It's very strange that Garletz should
come spying around and Â¦within a very
short time his uncle armed with a big
navy revolver should show up. Mr. Wil
son was a friend of mine and my sister,
taking a warm Interest In our affairs. It
is most unfortunate that his name should
have been dragged into the affair, but he
is not to blame in the least."
Drummond Insists that he believes Gar
letz knew more of his uncle's intentions
than he Is willing to admit. The brother
added:
"We came here to get the child. I did
not want to come over this evening, but
my uncle Insisted I should. Then It was
understood he was to see his wife and
see If there could not be some compro
mise flxed up. They had not yet been
divorced, but there was talk of a sep
aration. I knew, my uncle had a pistol
in his grip that he brought with him.
but did not know he brought It to Oak
land to-night. I would not go In the
house with him, so after I had pointed
it out to him as we walked by the place,
I left him and went up to the corner and
waited."
"My sister worried about her little girl
Helen, whom she had been compelled *.o
leave in Portland, and In December she
went alone to Oregon and got the child.
After that she knew and frequently said
that Seely would kill her at the first op
portunity."
Fearing Seely would take the child from
her, the mother sent the little one to a
friend this afternoon. If Garletz knew his
uncle premeditated murder he would not
admit that last night. He said:
"Seoly and my sister \*ere married on
Christmas of 1S33, much against the
wishes of cur family. Seely was 36 and
Mary only 18, and, although he was well
to do, he was dissipated and we did not
want her to marry him* It was only a
year after they were married that Mary
discovered him making love to a house
maid. She at once left him and .came
home. From that time she loathed him
and never willingly lived with him. Seely
followed her here and made all kinds of
promises of reformation. She finally went-.
back with him. but they were never happy
together after the first disagreement.
Whenever Seely was drunk he abused her
and frequently threatened her life. Las*.
AuRUft she determined to endure It no
longer and came down here again. I took
her Into my family and since my own
home was broken up last November, she
has kept house for me. Jj Last week we
moved over here, which was the reason
that Garletz and Seely had trouble In
finding her. *

anything comes up, will stand In with his
uncle- What reason has he to look us up?"

BRUSSELS. Feb. 8.â In the Chamber
of Deputies to-day a petition inviting Bel
glum to cfTer to arbitrate between Great
Britain and the Transvaal was ' debated
at some length.. The Foreign Minister,
M. de Favereau, said the Government did
not object to the petition being referred
to a committee, but they considered the
authors of the petition mistook the mean
ing of 'article 27 of The Hague convention
under which It was desired to act.
"At present circumstances do not offer
such an opportunity," continued the For
eign Minister. "We must not forget that
one of the principal powers guaranteeing
our independence \s taking part in this
conflict. We do not think that we have
sufficient authority In offer our mediation.
Another power, the United States, offered
mediation at the outset of the war. Eng
land responded that she\did not desire It
at any period. M. Delcassw^on behalf of
France, made similar declarations. Vir
tually the same declaration was made in
the German Reichstag-, and the Govern
ment of The Netherlands has not con
sidered that it had fallen to Holland to
take the Initiative in mediation. The
Chamber, therefore, will appreciate tho
assurance that the Belgian Government
cannot undertake, such an engagement."
M. Jansen proposed a motion approving
the conclusions of the commission dealing
with .the petition.
M. de Favereau xepeated that Interven
tion by Belgium was Impossible and that
the motion was superfluous.
The Chamber, however, adopted M. Jan

Lord Roberts' dispatches are not re

of the conduct of the war. but they are
interesting as proving that. throughout the
campaign he never had sufficient men.

field of operations.
Lord Roberts asserted deliberately that
the permanent tranquillity of the republic
"depends upon the complete disarma

I admit, but attainable with time and

Looking at all the circumstances. Lord
Roberts says the campaign is "unique In

declaring that "no finer force ever took;

The witness then detailed what he had
seen of the houses of ill-repute In China
town and tfcat he had seen white men and
boys visiting the places. Returning to
the subject of the purchase of lottery
tickets, Boyle told how he had been ac
companied by his brother and Rev. Frank
K. Baker, who desired to secure evidence
of the existence of vice and gambling in
the Chinese quarter.
"One Chinaman, told me," said Boyle
"of blackmail being levied by the police.
This Chinaman was interested In a gam
bling club. He told me that a committee
was formed to collect money from all the
dens in Chinatown. This committee dealt
with the police. The clubs were allowed
to run and a showing was made some
times of a raid. This committee collected
the money from thj gamblers and lottery
and slave owners and turned It over to
the police. He told me who collected the
money for the police."

"He said it was Sergeant Brophy. Bro

The audience loudly applauded Captain
Wlttman as he left the witness chair and
he was heard to mutter, "Well, I did not

District Attorney Bylngton was the next

Proceeding, Captain "Wlttman told how
he attended a. meeting of the Police
Judges, but he had only made sugges
tions when called upon. He had only told
the Judges what he had testified to be
fore the commission. â¢ -
"Have you ever heard of white men
playing fantan?"
"Not in San Francisco. I have heard
of it in Bakersfield."
This allusion to Bakersfield raised 1 a
laugh from all present; as Judge Laird,
who was questioning Wlttman, hails from
that city. â¢ . v Â¦
"Have you ever seen white men and
boys visiting Chinese houses of 111 re

"No; they would 'not allow white men

Captain Wlttman read the orders to the
police, and Judge Laird said: r.^Gtfc&t

the Chinese. They are cunning .and
evasive."
"You don't mean to say that the Chi

"Ves. that is just what I mean."
"Have you the records of the places you
raided?"
"Yes, of every raid I made, with the
dates. I am glad I kept them."
"How about the opium dens?"
"There is nothing to prevent a man
smoking opium in his room the same as
tobacco. The Superior- Court has de
cided that. We have to prove, the sale of
opium on the premises for use in order
to secure a conviction. You know what
the law on the subject Is, Judge."
"Is there any difficulty in locating the
opium smoking 1 dens?"
"There are very few of them. They ex
ist largely in the mind of a faking news
paper reporter."
"How about the- places where lottery
tickets arc sold?" .
."They all have strong doors and have
lookouts. On the first sign of the ap
proach of the police the alarm Is given
and the evidence is destroyed."
"Are they patronized by white men?"
"Yes."
"Why can't the police get Into these
places?"
"Like every one else,. they must ! ;be in
troduced." â¢
"Did you get in."
"Yes."
"Who Introduced you?"
"No one. I went in with a sledge ham
mer."
"Have you ever made any plans for reg
ulating gambling In Chinatown?"
"I don't make plans. I take my orders
from the Chief."
â¢ The witness was asked here If he could
furnish a list of the places In Chinatown
where gambling is' carried on and lottery
tickets sold, and he replied that he would
furnish such a list, but that it would. take
some time to compjle. Captain Wlttman
then described the manner in which the
Chinese gamblers and lottery sellers ope
rate. He told how. If they were broken
up In one quarter, they would start busi
ness In another direction. If arrested and
the fine was heavy, they would appeal
the cases to the Superior courts;, if the
fine was light, they would pay it, and the
great difficulty the police had was to se
cure evidence to convict.
"Have you ever heard of officers of po
lice being brltyd In Chinatown?"
"Yes: I have heard of It. Some years
ago I heard that corruption existed, and
I started to make an investigation. I
stopped In a little time, for I found that I
was making a fool of myself. Wherever I
went I was spotted."
Captain Wittman denied that he - had
suggested a plan to any one to regulate
gambling and vice. \ He had visited the
East in 1896, and had - made a report of
what'hje had seen to the Police Commis
sion and Chief Crowley. "Chief Crowley
told me my report was all right, but that
If we tried it in San Francisco it would
raise a Â¦ of a row." â¢'? ; . ;
Captain Wlttman claimed frequently
during his examination that he obeyed
the instructions of his superiors and tha,t
he was trained to discipline. Judge Laird
conducted the examination of Captain
Wlttman and the good nature of the
Judge is well known. The manner of the
police captain in the witness chair was
far from creditable, whatever his feelings
might have been that he had for years
been hounded by the Examiner, as he
claimed. A grand stand play in denounc
ing the Examiner drew cheers for the
captain from the spectators present.
In reply to the questions put to him,
Captain Wlttman said;
"I have been on the police force of this
city since 18S3. I am 43 years old. I was
first in charge of the squad in Chinatown
in August, 1SS8. After serving three
months I was relieved by Sergeant Gano.
I was a sergeant at that time. Early In
1889 Chief Crowley sent for me' and gave
me orders to go fo Chinatown and arrest
Sergeant Gano and his squad. I did. so
and took them to the City Hall. I relieved
them of their stars and weapons. That
was the only time that I had any direct
work in Chinatown. I am in charge of
the Northern Police District, which in
cludes Chinatown, but the sergeant of the
Chinatown squad reports directly to the
Chief. I da.not know of more raids being
made before I was in charge of the squad
than during the time I was responsible I
know that I made a good showing.
"What officers have been bn duty In
Chinatown?"
"I don't, know. You have the list. It
was ordered for you*."
"Who told you the location of the
gambling places when you went into
Chinatown in charge of the squad?"
"Officer Briggs, who had been with the
previous squad, was retained to do it"
"Is it difficult to find the places where
gambling is carried on in .Chinatown?"
"No, it is not; any one can find them
to-day." , Â¦
"Did you ever see at any time gambling
in Chinatown?"
"I have never seen a game of fantan
played or a lottery ticket marked."
"In what manner do you make ar
rests?"
"It is vary difficult. We have to batter
down the doors. -By the time we get in
side all the evidence is destroyed. They
have had eliding doors, secret alley ways
hoppers leading to -the sewers, and when
the alarm is given they quickly destroy
the evidence we are after."
"Could not all these places be broken
up?"
At the morning session all the members
of the commission were on hand and Cap
tain Wlttman was the first witness to be
called.
Taking yesterday's proceedings Â£j3 . a
sample of what is to be accomplished, the
investigation of the Police Department
narrows down to shrewish sauabble be
tween the self-styled "monarch of the
dailies" and Police Captain Wittman, who
assumes that the Legislature of the eov
ereign State of California Is spending
thousands of dollars to Drove that he, the
captain, is. like Caesar's wife, above sus
picion.
In the morning, afternoon and evening
session held yesterday, not a single fact
was brought out that was of material
value.
Police Captain Wittman, defiant. Inso
lent in demeanor and pelf-assertive, was
under fire for some hours; a youn*
reporter of a morning * paper told,
what every one knows, that lottery tickets
were sold openly in Chinatown, and as
tounded every one by asserting that he
was the only white person who was able
to play fantan with the Chinese in their
gambling dens. Commissioner Newhall of
the Police Commission entered the lists
against a representative of the Examine
and Assemblyman Webber In plain terms
told both parties that the Legislative
Committee did not care -o hear statements
from either side, but was rres nt to make
Investigation for itself. The buga.boo of
the "highbinder" was sprung by the Ex
aminer to prevent the publicity of tho
names of the Chinese ana white men from
whom it claims to have received certain
information that police corruption existed
Jn Chinatown and the Commission of the
Legislature, like the -Prince in "Romei
and Juliet," exclaimed, "A plague on both
your houses."

difficulty in playing 'he lottery, and Po
lice Sergeant Brophy took the stand and
ewore that while, In Chinatown he was
scrupulously honest. Captain Wittman
was in the courtroom ur.d asked that the
Chinese dealer at 731 Pacific street be
summoned. A Deputy Sheriff was sent
after him but he coulcj ;iot find him.
Captain Wittman voluateered to so after
Ihe coolie, to smash In the. doors of hl3
house and bring him to court. This spect
acular effort caught the fancy of the
crowd and Wlttman. at the head of nearly
a hundred men, marched to 731 Pacific
street. He smashed Jn three doors, but
found no coolie Iotterv .dealer. He and
the crowd returned to Hie Hall of Justice
and the Inquiry was resumed.
James H. Barry was placed on the wit
ness Ftand and told how he played a Chi
nese lottery and saw other white men do
the same. The last witness of the night
was Assemblyman Wright, one of the
members of the Investigating committee.
â¢who went In the earlv evening with an
Examiner reporter to the Chinese quarter
and played both Iotterv and fantan. It
was interesting that both he and the re
porter were at the game. Anybody else
in the courtroom coald. had he desired,

THREE long sessions, morning,
afternoon and evening, marked
yesterday the legislative In
quiry into the affairs of the
Police D;partme"nt.
Police Captain George W.
Wlttman was the first witness
of the day and In many respects he was
the most remarkable one called to the
stand during this Inquiry. He voluntarily
assumed the position that he is the per
eon at whom all accusations are aimed.
He spoke as If he must vindicate himself
Fince an investigation of alleged corrup
tion has been ordered and is In progress.
Occupying this singular position he in
sisted upon resenting charges which have
not been insinuated against him much
less preferred.
He spoke in a high, hysterical key. He
â¢was deliberately insulting to the investi
gating, committee ana In his calm egotism
provoked frequent outbursts of laughter.
He denounced newspapers in general and
the Examiner in particular. He accepted
frequent opportunities to be profane and
left as a last Impression his assertion that
whatever of crime and evil is going on in
Chinatown he cannot prevent it. "
He went so far as to say that he could
rot make a successful raid on a lottery
game in Chinatown -jnloiss some one would
give him an introduction to the place.
He sv.-ore that he never saw a lottery
ticket marked in San Francisco and never
taw fantan played. In view of the testi
mony of a subsequent witness these as
sertions of Captain Wlttman had a pe
culiar effect.
After he had told that he cannot sup
press gambling Captain Wittman assured
the committee that he had" never accepted
a dishonest dollar jn his life and nobody
can catch him at it. He never was dis
honest, he said. an<l he never will be. He
feels, he declared, that his character is
at etake in this investigation and ho
stands ready to be caught if that is pos
sible. With this remarkable conclusion
he was excused and District Attorney
Bylngton took his place. His testimony,
however, was not important, as it shed
no new light on the inquiry-
The fir*t witness of the afternoon was
John Boyle, an Examiner reporter, who
showed conclusively that gambling is
nrtoriously open and widespread In. the
Chinese quarter. He has patronized many
lottery jigeneies and never found the
slightest difficulty in entering the games.
In every place he found many white pa
trons. He also declared that he played
fantan in the clubs and found access to
them practically as easy as to the lot
teries. His testimony showed that gamb
ling is significantly wide open in China
town.
When he attempted to prove that this
condition' of affairs means that the police
are corrupt, he stopped where all Inves
tigators have stopped before. He could
prove nothing except on the word of Chi
nese, who, of course, cannot be^ believed
in a court of Justice or anywKere else.
The names of his Chinese informants he
would not give and George A- Newhall.
president nf the Police Commission, de
manded that the investigating commit
tee insist upon asking for them. Objec
tion was made and the committee de
clared that if it wanted the name* It
would ask for them. As far as proof of
blackmail or corruption was concerned,
the testimony of Boyle therefore had no
significance.
The Rev. Drs. Baker and Bane related
their experience In Chinatown, where
they saw gambling being conducted utter
ly without molestation from the police.
The social evil Is rampant and. under con
ditions which make It horrifying.

examined. The first was Fred Hobro.
who was supposed to know something,
but did not. William Maloney and Hugh
Thompson, newspaper men, took the
*tand and corroborated the assertion of
Boyle that at 731 Pacific street a Chinese
lottery dealer had Informed him that he
was safe from police molestation because
when he did not pay a fine In court he
paid Captain Wittman. â¢
A. I. Torres testified that he found ao
Jf HE legislative committee which is investigating the af
fairs of the Police Department was treated to a series of
exciting incidents, but the inquisitors are as far as they ever
were from any tangible proof that any member of the police
force has received a dollar in blackmail from Chinese gamblers or
other coolie offenders.
Captain JVittman created something of a sensation by t'olun
tarily accepting the proposition that in this inquiry his reputation is
at. stake. He treated the inz'esti gators in an insolent manner, ar
raigned the Examiner as a malicious sheet which has hounded him
for years, and defied any one to prove that he ever accepted or
sought a dishonest dollar in his life.
He' candidly admitted his inability to cope with the gamblers of
Chinatozi'n, and confessed that even the conviction of isolated of
fenders is practically impossible. When three witnesses testified
that a Chinese lottery-dealer had told them that he paid bribes
to JVittman, the police captain, angry, excited and theatrical, rushed

A FUTILE EFFORT TO CAPTURE A CHINESE ACCUSER
Assemblyman Wright Becomes an
Amateur Gambler, Plays Fan-
Tan and Boasts of a Winning
jggB^h Â£ VERAL amateur gamblers zvere placed on the zi'itiresi
stand yesterday by the legislative inquisitors, and told how
Ujm easily, frequently and successfully they have played lotto y
and fantan in the Chinese quarter. It is not clear zirh?t
purpose this testimony ivas supposed to serve. The police admit tlu:t
whites and Asiatics gamble in Chinatown; Ihe public has bee. i
aware of the fact for years. The point of the inquiry is to discover \
why gambling is not stopped by the police. Thus far nothing more
serious than suspicion and innuendo lias been produced to bear upon
this issue. ' .
The t star gambler of the evening was Assemblyman Wright,
who deserted his associates for the night session to follow the fas
cinating beans of fantan in a Chinese gambling-house.. He zvas
proud to say he zvon a fezv dollars in his exciting venture. He has
also a lottery ticket which may x K f w to-day. James H. Barry,
a Grand Juryman, also testified that he flirted with the fickle goddess
and didn't even make good as a four-spot. An Examiner reporter
+ added a detailed account of the
ups and dozvns of Chinese gam
* â i bling, and as far as interest zvas
Â¦ .^S^_fe\ concerned the testimony zi-as over.

"I do not know them."
Mr. Knowland â Have you ever told thÂ«*
police of the result of your Investiga
tions?
"I have not."
"Have you ever offered to conduct th<*
police to the places where you purchased
lottery tickets?"
"I have not."
"Did you ever file a complaint as to
these lottery dens?"
"I did not."
"Did you ever tako any action on thes.i
matters besides reporting them to your
paper?"
"I did not."
"Why did you not give information t->
the police?"
"Because the relations between myself
and Chief Sullivan were strained and on
one occasion he told me he did not want
me to enter his office."
"Have you ever made any effort ta
locate tht numbers of the stars of the
police officers who you say stood near
a lottery den when you went In?"
"I have not."
"Could you recognize the officers if you
saw them?"
"I don"t think so."

At this point Mr. Webber asked Boyla
for the names of the white men and Chi

for immunity was paid to Captain Wlft

ground that he had pledged himself to
secrecy, and that publicity of the names
might lead to serious trouble.
Police Commissioner Newhall here arose

witness giving the names in public.
Mr. Livernash. who said he was one of

"Winnings or grand jurors and members

Meloney said that he heard the Chinese
proprietor remark that there would be no

"Sometime go court, pay fine; some

Laxative Bromo-Quir.lne removes the coum.*ers, was the only witness examined. He
acted as Chief of Police until Colonel W.
P. Sullivan was chosen to succeed Chief
Lees, who was placed on the retired list.'
Biggy, in succinct way, told the story
of his political rise and fall. Because-of
his refusal to stand-by an agreement en
tered into between Mayor Phelan and the
Examiner to make Lieutenant Esola Chief
of Police, he was removed from the com
mission and his place on the board given
to ex-Judge Wallace. . >
"I wish It to be understood, gentlemen,"
said Biggy after being sworn, "that I am
out of politics. . I want no 'public â¢ office.
If I ever accept another one It will be
when I have" a competency. I am here
in answer to your subpena and at con
siderable cost to my private business af
fairs. I will willingly answer all questions
asked me and aid you in your investiga
tion. I have no friends to reward nor ene
mies to punish."
: Biggy was then asked to tell the Jury
under what circumstances and conditions
he was appointed Police Commissioner by
Mayor Phelan.
"I did not seek appointment on the Po
lice Board," said he. "I wanted a place
on the Board of Public Works. I felt
that I would be able to do some good
there.
"A day or two before Mayor Phelan an
nounced the appointments I received a
note from Mr. Lawrence, asking me to
call at the Examiner office. I went there.
Lawrence told me that he had informa
tion, to the Â¦ effect that Â¦ I was 'slated' for
the Police Commission instead of the
Board of Public Works.' That was . the
first time that I heard my name men
tioned in connection with the Police Com
mission. I, asked him to tell me the name
of his informant. He refused to-do so.
saying that the Information was of a con
fidential nature. He assured me, however,
that there waa no doubt. about my ap
pointment. . ':
"The subject Â» of Â¦ making \ Lieutenant
Esola Chief of Police was. then broached
by him. While I did not make any direct
promise to support Esola, I said that I
felt favorably Inclined toward his candi
dacy. After the appointments were made
I received an invitation to attend a caucus
In Mayor Phelan's Â¦ office. I 1 1 attended " it
and there was introduced to Esola. When
the newspaper attack was made on Esola
I felt friendly toward him and that-friend
ly feeling existed up to the time he testi
fied - before the Police Commission that
he / had no recollection of the caucus - in
Mayor Phelan's office. -j I knew then that
he was either a perjurer or a man so men
tally weak that he was not fitted. for the
Important office of Chief of Police., I'an
nounced that I would .not vote for h'imj
and there the trouble began. â¢
.'â¢Mayor Phelan and' Mr. Lawrence tried
to whiD me Into line. I told them that
under no circumstances would I vote for
Esola. The rest of the story you know,
gentlemen. Mayor Phelan removed me
from the board and relegated me to pri
vate life. I am not sorry for that. I
much rather prefer' being a private cit
izen than a public official, If with an of
fice I must surrender my spirit. I have
never been dictated to by any one nor
forced to "do what my conscience dictates
to me is not right."
"Are you friendly with the Mayor?"
asked one cf the Jurors.
"We have never spoken since the night
of my removal from office." replied Biggy.
"While you were acting as Chief of Po
lice was any attempt made to bribe you?"
was asked.
"Only on one occasion," replied Biggy.
"I arrested a Chinaese for a misdemeanor
and he slipped $5 into my hand to let him
go. I then placed an additional charge of
attempted bribery against him."
"Did any charges of crookedness on the
part of police officers In Chinatown reach
your ears?"
â¢ VI heard several rumors of crooked
ness,"' answered Biggy, "but I was un
able to find any proof of wrongdoing."
"Do you believe it possible to close the
gambling dens and bawdy houses in the
Chinese quarter?" asked another Juror.
"I do," answered Biggy. "When I as
sumed office as Acting Chief of Police I
consulted with the police captains and
told them I wanted fifteen men who could
be trusted. They named fifteen policemen
for me. I sent the men Into Chinatown
and very soon closed up the gambling
houses and other dens. There may have
been a game running here and there, but
they never ran until the squad had gone
home for the night."
"Do you believe that the existing laws
are sufficient to do away with the places
complained of?"
Â¦ -."I do," replied the Â¦witness. "The laws
are amply sufficient. All that' is neces
sary to eradicate the evil Is to secure
proper officials to enforce the laws. There
is no trouble about the law. The lack of
enforcement is what causes all these 'ru
mors of crookedness. The men who aro
sent Into Chinatown to close the dens
must be men who can resist temptation,
for the Chinese are great, tempters. With
fifteen men who will not listen to the
tempter, it should be an easy matter to
close all the objectionable houses in the

one less, because there were only seventeen

in their estimates down to three, not in

tion that while In charge of the China

Hon. Joseph R. Knowland. Chairman Special
Assembly Committeeâ Dear Sir: I observe that
Mr. Boyle of the Examiner, In giving his testi
mony to-day before your committee, enumer
ated various amounts which Â¦ he claimed were
l>ald by Chinese to the police as bribe money
â¢to protect Ramblers and others against inter
ference, but 'he refused to give . publicly the
sources of his information or the names of his
informants, who are Chinese, and who, as he
Fays, pledged him to secrecy as to their Iden
tity. As the witness, however, expressed his
willingness to give this information privately
to the committee, I respectfully suggest that
the committee cite these . persons and compel
them to testify. If any money has been paid to
policemen I desire to know it. and this Is an
easy and o.uick way of ascertaining '. the truth.
I will feel very grateful to the committee for
any service of this kind. Respectfully yours,
JAMES D. PHEL.AN, Mayor.
GBASTD JURORS PROBE
INTO CHINESE AFFAIRS
The investigation being . made . by the
Grand Jury into the management of po
lice affairs was resumed yesterday after
noon. William J. Biggy, a former mem
ber of tbe Board of Police Co mmission-
Wittman eaid that he would bring in the
proprietor of that lottery Joint even if it
took a sledge hammer to get him Into
court. Meloney and Thompson had. in
the meanwhile been out with a deputy
sheriff in order to hale the offending lot
tery keeper before the committee.
"I'll take all the consequences, ex
claimed Wittman. "I'll do this en my own
personal responsibility."
He went downstairs, got his sledge
hammer and a patrol wagon. Reporters
Jumped In and record speed was . made
to the lottery joint.
One blow of Wittman's hammer resulted
in smashing the front door. Everybody
rushed in. looking for the game that was
not there. Somebody told the captain
that "he" might be in another room, and
so more doors were smashed. The Cap
tain of Police left the patrol wagon driver
in charge, drove the horses and his sledge
hammer back and reported to the com
mittee that the man he expÂ«:ted to find
had gone calling or got out the back way
Into Sullivan alley. The Incident would
have been funny if it were not for the dis
comflture of Captain "Wittman. His ex
cuses for not finding the elusive lottery
man provoked a smile on the faces of the
investigators. It will probably cost Cap
tain Wittman about $1 75 in damages to
make good his sledge hammer bluff.
Grand Juror James H. Barry was the
star witness of the night. Unctuously he
told how he had been led astray and
tempted to woo the fickle goddess of for
tune by one Boyle, a Journalist. He went
with him to several lottery joints. Some
times Boyle paid, sometimes Barry. On
Boyle's paid-for tickets Barry won noth
ing*. In one place, 723 Sacramento
street, 'Barry played a ticket for 15 cents.
His employe. A. H. Torres, who also has
the habit of buying tickets, cashed in
J10 45 as a result of Boyle's markings.
Torres described Barry's as "a 15-cent
throe- way ticket." Barry claimed that
he did not know what that meant, an.1
was greatly perturbed at his adventures
with Boyle, because his children called
him "a Chinee gambler." Barry said he
gave his winnings to Torres because he
thought playing lottery was naughty.'
Assemblyman Wright of the Investigat
ing committee was the last witness of the
night- Like the unctuous Barry, he had
also gone out with Boyle, but the Hon.
Mr. Wrtght played fantan. He won
$5 50. which a member of the committee
remarked sotto' voce, "Was good for
many steams or even a small bottle."
Wrigrht said he had no difficulty in getting
into the fantan games, saw no other white
men there, and although he could not
lay down the rules of Ah Hoyt still he
won the money. He Jingled it fondly In
his pocket.
Evidence was sought by the committee
as to the number, of white men and boys
and Chinese that visited' these games.
Barry counted eighteen in one place, the

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 8.â A delegation from San
Francisco was beforo the Assembly Com
mittee on Judiciary this evening to pro
test against the Governor's health bills.
The bills before the committee were As
sembly bills 553 and .V>X one- to malce the
publication of the presence of contagious
diseases a felony, unless the State Board
of Health has previously declared tha
disease to exist, and the other compels
local health boards lo act directly under
the authority ol the State Board, and giv
ing the State Board control wherever an<l
whenever It cares to exercise It.
The delegation from San Francisco
which came up to oppese the bills waÂ»
composed of W. R. Wheeler and Charles
E. Naylor. of the Commerce Committee;
Hugh Craig and Morris U. Bates, of tha
Chamber of Commerce; William M. Bun
ker, of the Merchants' Association; H. Â£>-
Loveland. of the Board of Trade. anJ
George Plummer. of the Shipowners' As
sociation. The committee was accompan
ied by Dr. Williamson, president of the
San Francisco Board of Health, and Dr.
A. P. O'Brien. Health Office of San Fran
cisco.
Those who spoke were JCaylor, Cralcr.
Williamson. Bunker ana "Wheeler. Nay
lor argued that, from a legal point of
view, the Legislature could not pass a
general law to govern the city when It
had ratified a charter that ravÂ» to tha
city a government of its own. Dr. Wil
liamson spoke from the standpoint of a
physician, describing the better position
of the local board of health to 'find and
control disease within the city, and tha
serious embarrassment* that would follow
were it made but an, appendage of tha
State body. He referred also to- the In
consistency which made dereliction of
duty on the part of a tocal board of health
or any of its attaches a felony, and simi
lar dereliction on the cart of the State
Board or any of its attaches, only a mis
demeanor.
The delegation was plied with questions
as to the- city's objection to the authority
of the State Board of Health, and the re
ply that the objection was on the theorv
that the city best* knew its own internal
needs, drew more questions as to the re
lations between the city and State.
But the tables were turned and the dele
gation demanded why the existing order
of things should be upset and the author
ity of a competent board" should be sup
planted by one claimed to be no better.
The session closed and the delegation was
courteously dismissed. Xo fiction was
taken upon the bills, that being reserved
for a future meeting.

ALAMEDANS AGREE
ON BEAPPOHTTONMENT
New Assemblyman Will Be Given to
Berkeley and Ssnator to the
Country.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 8â The Alameda County
delegation met twice to-day and agreed
provisionally -ipon the reapportionment
lines of the county under the Cutter bill.
The delegation has had internecine trou
bles in cutting out a new Senatorial and
a hew Assembly district, but practical
agreement was reached at these confer
ences.
The new Assemblyman -will go to Berke
ley. The northern ends of the Forty-ninth
and Fifty-first .districts are cut off to
make the new district, which thus com
prises Berkeley and West Berkeley. Little
change except this Is made in the Assm
bly dictrlcts. A small portion Is to be
taken frcm the Fiftieth District, which
Bliss represents, to add to Kelley's dis
trict, the Fortv-eighth in order to con
form to the new ward lines in Oakland.
The new Senator will be given to the
country. The district will comprise Mur
iay, Washington. Eden and probably
Brooklyn townships. There will be some
changes of the lines of the other Senato
rial districts. The Seventh Ward in Oak
land will probably be taken from Lukens"
district and put in Taylor's district, al
though Taylor does not yearn for that
stronghold of the Pardee-Dalton forces.
The amended Cutter apportionment bill
will precipitate numerous fights, both in
the Senate and Assembly. As an illustra
tion-of this Senator Smith of Kern has
expressed his intention of fighting the al
lotment of an extra Senator to Alameda.
MITCH OPPOSITION
TO BURNETT'S BILL
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb.' 8.â Burnett's Senate bill
351, which provides that the name of the
manufacturer and his address must be
plainly marked upon all- goods manufac
tured in this State, has aroused consid
erable opposition, and there Is now under
consideration an amendment designed to
meet and allay the objections that have
been urged against the measure.
The bill provides that every article
manufactured shall bear this Imprint, but
it further provides that when this is im
possible or impracticable the stamp may
be placed on the package or covering in
which the articles are packed.
The objection to the bill, however, which
it will be- attempted to do away with by
amendment, lies In the fact that It would
prevent the common custom among busi
ness men of having goods manufactured
for them especially stamped with the
selling firm's name. Some form of amend
ment which will- allow this, while not al
lowing the goods so exempted to be made
by Chinese or convict labor and after
ward sold without the tell-tale mark will
be drawn. If possible, before the bill comes
up for second reading.
The primary object of the bill Is to pre
vent the sale of Chinese-made goods
without letting the buyer know that he
is purchasing such goods, and also to
enable the proper person to be held re
sponsible . in case of adulteration. The
objection to the bill came mainly from
the Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation of San Francisco.'^nd It was
directed not to the principle but to the
operation of the measure.

AGRICULTURAL PARK
BILL PASSES COMMITTEE
Is Amended Out of Form and Void
and Will Meet Warm Reception
When Presented.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 8.â The Agricultural Park
bill has passed the Senate Finance Com
mittee and Monday it will emerge from
its temporary obscurity and take its place
on the rile. Its best friend will not know
it, however, for it appears In the form of
a substitute measure. The elaborate
scheme for the purchase of land, the
building of tracks and the erection of
buildings had dwindled down to a plain,
unvarnished appropriation to pay the
debts of the State Agricultural Society
and to turn over to the State the land
which has been in the society's name. It
is provided in the bill, however, that the
State shall use the land only for the pur
poses of a fair grounds and a racetrack.
In this form the bill was favorably voted
upon by the committee.
The committee vote does not end mat
ters, however, for the commltteemen. with
one or two exceptions, who voted for the
measure, will vote against it on the floor
of the House unless the provision trans
ferring the land to the State is further
amended In accordance with the senti
ment expressed by the committee this
evening and the promise of Senator Dev
lin, the author of the original bill, to se
cure the consent of the members of the
society to the proposed change. The
change demanded is the unconditional
transfer of the property to the State, in
fee simple, with no strings or conditions
and no promises on either side. Unless
this is done the bill will have no chance
in the Senate, for the members of the
Finance Committee will oppose it bitterly.
The original plan of the society was to
substitute two bills for the original meas
ure, one to appropriate $45,000 to pay the
debts, amounting to $43,625 3S, and the
other to appropriate $35,000 to erect a
grandstand and other buildings on the
grounds. The committee would not hear
of the $35,000 appropriation and so the
fight was made on the appropriation to
pay the debts. A schedule submitted
shewed the total losses of the society for
the last ten years to be $48,179 94 and the
gains $4551 50. In only two years were
there gains. The balance on the wrong
side of the ledger, $43,625 35. is repre
sented by two notes held by D. O. Mills &
Co., one for $25,000 and one for $12,000, and
bills payable amounting to $6625 3S.
The action of the committee was taken
mninly to get the bill off the committee
files and into the Senate.

Savage Introduces Resolution Which
Goes to the Extreme of
Absurdity.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. Â£.â Savagre of Los Angeles
introduced in the Assembly to-day a reso
lution which coes quite to the extreme of
aosurdity in junke'ing trips. It author
izes the Committee on Public Morals to
visit places of amusement, the frequent
ing of which by children is sought to be
prevented by several bills now pending;
a.lso to make trir-s of Investigation in re
pard to a bill introduced to-day by Brown
Â«t Â£an Francisco, making It a felony to
bind the feet of a child so as to cause
malformation. Under the resolution the
committee might take a trip to any city
of the State where beer halls and similar
places of amusement exist or where there
are any considerable number of Chinese
residents.
The Assembly, hardened as It !s to ex
pensive junketing and the repeated dupli
cation of trips to public institutions, re
ceived the resolution with some derision.
"Webber, the- chairman of the Committee
on Public Morals, was in the Assembly
chamber all day yesterday, but he left
tÂ».e resolution to be introduced to-day in
his absence. Savage, who introduced it
by request, seemed somewhat ashamed of
havir.g done it.
The resolution was referred to the Way?
and Means Committee, and in view of
that committee's recent attitude in oppo
sition to the multiplicity of junketing
trips, the resolution will probably die in
committee.

Ralston, who fought the biH !n the
Mines and Mining Committee, spoke In
Its support. He eaid:
"In committee I took the ground that
the 1500,000 already available should be
partially expended at least before the
State should be asked for this final ap
propriation. However, the United States
engineers in charge of the Government
plans have refused to recommend the ex
penditure of any part of the money
available until the entire JiDO.OQO from the
State has been appropriated, and in view
of that fact I will vote for the bill."
Irish, who introduced the original As
eembly bill corresponding to the commit
tee substitute for the Senate bill which
v.as under consideration, spoke briefly,
trd Duryea said that he had been incor
rectly reported as having voted against
the bill in the Committee o:i Mines and
Mining. He said he found the miners of
his district were unanimous in support
rt it and that he believed that in voting
for It he was voting for the interests of
the miners and of the agriculturists.

GALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 8.-The character of
aid that Is to be extended to the
'University of â¢ California was put
beyond ail question at a confer
ence at 2 o'clock this afternoon between
Governor Gaga and a number of Senators.
The result' is in the nature of a compro
mise between rhose in favor of the Gov
ernor's plan and the partisans of the
Kowell bills.
The bill carrying a direct appropriation
of $200,000. will be passed by the Senate and
Assembly and signed by the Governor â
such Is the assurance given -to-day. Of
the Rowell bills all will be dropped but
oneâ the measure imposing a tax en the
act of incorporation. This bill will be
urged, and if it passes the revenue it
yields will be placed in the general fund,
while direct appropriations will be drawn
from that fund for the support of the
university.
Senator Rowell, a Regent of the Univer
sity of California, who introduced the
original bills; Senator Smith of ' Kern,
chairman of the Finance Committee, and
Senators Taylor. Lukens and Leavitt of
the Alameda County delegation were pres-
Special Dispatch to The CalL
ent at the Interview with thÂ» Governor
this afternon. Governor Gage expressed
himself as unequivocally In favor of lib
eral support of the university. He took
the crotind that In future aid for the uni
versity, in addition to its fixed income,
should be given by direct appropriations,
the university appropriation to become a
recognized part of the budget; the amount
of the biennial appropriation, however, to
vary according to the university's needs.
The Governor expressed the view that tha
amount needed biennially would be about
520O.00O.
It was aprreed that the form of the bill
appropriating- $200,000. which Lukens intro
duced in tbe Senate and Foster in the As
sembly, should be changed somewhat. la
the original bill none of the appropriation
was to be made available until January.
1302. This will be amended by making: a
portion, probably $50,000, available at once.
There Is some doubt whether the meas
ure transferring the $43,000 in the Gov
ernor's mansion fund to the maintenance
fund of the university will be a popular
bill. It is certain that It will have the
opposition of Sacramento, but unless It be
withdrawn and a direct appropriation of
$30,000 substituted it will probably bÂ»
passed in spite of the opposition.

A CAUSE OF HEADACHE.
One Very Common Cause, Generally-
Overlooked.
Headache Is a symptom, an Indication
of derangement or disease in some organ.
and the cause of the headache is difficult
to locate because so many diseases have
headache as a prominent symptom: de-
rangement of the stomach and liver, heart
trouble, kidney disease, lung trouble, eye
Ftra'.n or ill-fitting glasses all produce
h'adachrs. and If we could always locate
the orpan which is at fault the cure of
obstinate headaches would be a much
simpler matter.
However, for that form of headache
called frontal headache, pain back of the
eyes and in forehead, the cause Is now
known to be catarrh of the head and
throat: when the headache is located In
back of head and neck it Is often caused
from catarrh of the stomach or liver.
At any rate, catarrh is the most com-
mon cause of such headaches and the
cure of the catarrh causes a prompt dis-
appearance of the headaches.
There Is at present no treatment for
catarrh fo convenient and effective as
Btuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new internal
remedy In tablet form, composed of anti-
septics like Eucalyptol. Guaiacol and
Blood Hoot, which act upon the blood and
cause the elimination of the f-atarrhal poi-
pon from the system through the natural
channels.
MIfs Cora Ainsley, a prominent school
teacher in one of our normal schools.
FPÂ«aks of her experience with catarrhal
headaches and eulogizes Stuart's Catarrh
Tablet? as a cure for them. She says:
"I suffered daliy from severe frontal
headache and pain in and back of the
Â«-yes. at times so intensely as to incapa-
citate me in my daily duties. I had cuf-
fered from catarrh more or less for years,
but never thought it was the cause of my
headaches, but finally became convinced
that such was the case, because the head-
aches were always worse whenever I had
a f old or frc-fh attack of catarrh.
"Stuart's Catarrh Tablets were highly
recommended to me as a safe and pleas-
ant catarrh cure, and after using: a few
DO-cent boxes which I procured from my
druggist. I was surprised and delighted
to find that both the catarrh and head-
aches had prone for cood."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are eold by
druppists at fifty cents per package, un-
der the guarantee of the proprietors that
they contain absolutely no cocaine (found
In so many catarrh cures), no opium (so
common in chean cough cures), nor any
harmful drup. They contain simply the
wholesome antiseptics necessary to de-
Btroy and drive from the system the
perms cf catarrhal disease.

The victory of the varsity over the Fire
man's Fund team last Saturday has given
much encouragement to the baseball men.
It is now thought that a satisfactory bat
tery wil! be forthcoming in the develop
ment of Traeger and Parker. Coach Mur
phy expresses himself as * being much
pleased with the game his striplings put
up in their initial trial. He says that in
both stick work and knowledge of the
gr.me they are ahead of last year's var
sity at the end of .the season. What he
wants especially are hitters, and from
last Saturday's showing It looks as If he
would get them.
A letter has been received here from
the University of Nevada, challenging the
freshman team to a field meet to be held,
in Reno in March, with a return match
at Palo Alto in April. It is likely that
this challenge, as well as one from the
Oakland High School, will be- accepted.
The freshman team will be unusually
strong with Henley and Holman of Ukiah
for the jumps, vaults and hurdles, and
Hamilton and Lamb for the sprints.
The track men will be put to work next
week. A jÂ»Â»rles of handicap \ and inter
class field days has been planned by Man
ager Oilman in order that every one
capable of entering an event "in this
branch of athletics may get out on the
field.
Santa Clara College has also been called
off unless the San Jose diamond is in such
shape that it can be played on by that
time.
Candidates for Varsity Positions Have Begun
Active Training Under the Coaches. .
THE schedule of baseball games
between the Fireman's Fund team
and the University of California
and Stanford began last Saturday
with a match between the cardi
nal nine and the Insurance men. The col
lege men won the day when they were
practically defeated. Ever since the los
ers have been swearing vengeance, and
this afternoon when they will meet the
Blue and Gold on the California campus
they say that victory will be thiers.
California has some good baseball ma
terial in the course of development and
will present a strong nine this season.
The weather has militated against the
field work of the candidates for the var
sity nine, but even in this preliminary
practice the quality of the material on
hand has been disclosed.
The Fireman's Fund team is composed
of a number of professionals and high
class amateursâ men who, with a little
training, could surpass anything the col
leges have within their baseball ranks.

This is the month of special stakes for
the coursers. The biggest of all will be
the' California Plate and the Belle Bran
don, which will have a three days' run
ning at Union Coursing- Park on Friday,
February 22; Saturday, February 23, and
Sunday, February 24. Champion events
are also on the month's programme.
Sapling stakes heretofore have been
looked upon by coursing men as some
thing of the freak order. The eccentrici
ties of the youngsters, the many faults of
a green and untrained youth and Inex
perience on the field make saplings more
or less amusing and grotesque when run
ning in stake events. But this year a lot
of saplings have been seen In preliminary
trials that Is likely to upset all the
derogatory opinions- of the cultured leash
men who do not care to stomach a sapling
stoke.
Ten days ago the first sapling stake of
the year was run at Union Park. This
was a surprise event and showed beyond
pei adventure of doubt that there are
some saplings quite capable pf mature be
havior. Last year the Belle Brandon
was won by Freda C. There were twenty
eight entries, which at that time was con
sidered a fairly long list. This year
there will be forty-eight entries,' at least
that number Is expected, and among them
will be some brilliant youngsters, particu
larly for the For Freedom stock.
The second sapling stake of the year
will be run next Wednesday, February
13. This will be the second stake lesson
and will be open only to Belle. Brandon
entries. There Is a greater rivalry at
present among the owners of saplings
than ever before.
The California Plate, ninety-six entries,
will be an event second only to the John
Grace cup. Sixty-five nominations have
been received and they include a number
of the very best dogs. Â¦ Luxor,-Palo Alto.
Beacon and a. host of other crack hounds

ATHLETES
REWARDED
ONCE again the local ring storm
rages about the head of slashing
Terry McGovern, the ambitious
rlngsters who bristle and burn to
lower his colors, the prizefight
promoters and the prizefight managers.
The first change in the pugilistic barom
eter came as a storm tiding from Aus
tralia, the home of Tim Hegarty. greatest
of colonial feather-weights. This was fol
lowed later in the week by the arrival
of Frank Erne, who is here in San Fran
cisco, as he himself declares, to escape
the pneumonia generating blasts of the
East; or, as his friends say, for no other
purpose than to be matched with Mc-
Govern.
For a month or two the National Sport
inir Club, the Twentieth Century Athletic
Club and the San Francisco Athletic Club
have striven most earnestly to sign Mc-
Govern with some other feather-weight
whose past performances would Insure
the favor of the patronizing ring public.
The field was canvassed, and out of a
dozen names mentioned for fistic opposi
tion to the renowned Terry two stood out
from the restâ Tim Hegarty of Australia
and Frank Erne of Buffalo.
Hegarty is represented by George Hart
ing, the fighter himself not being sched
uled to arrive in San Francisco until the
middle' of March. An "Eastern dispatch
announced early in the week that McGov
ern had signed to fight* Hegarty before
the Twentieth Century Club on April 30.
The purse offered was $7000 and. accord-
Ing to the telegraphic statement. Jim
Kennedy,- official matchmaker for the
Twentieth Century Club, had consum
mated all the necessary preliminary plans
for this fight. But Kennedy evidently ran
in advance of facts. Hartlng. who is the
holder of the Hegarty reins, says he has
not signed with Sam Harris, McGovern's
manager, and further, that he will not
before all the. local clubs are given the
privilege of bidding on a purse.
This Is the casus belli, and It looks very
much as If the match of April would have
to be Erne-McGovern. and not Hegarty-
McGovern. A purse of $7000 was offered
Harris by Jim Kennedy In behalf of the
Twentieth Century Club and was prompt
ly accepted. Tim Hegarty's challenge to
McGovern being the foundation on which
the offer was placed. Right on its heels
came an ?S000 offer from the National
Sporting Club. Here was one better, and
Hartlng at once made for the wires to
apprise Harris of the bigger purse. Hart-
Ir.g telegraphed Harris that he would ac
cept McGovern's challenge for his man.
but insisted ! that the fight be before the
club offerine the more generous bait of
gold. Hartlng Is waiting for an answer
to his last message. He does not. how
ever, expect anything favorable for him
self, as he sees in Erne's arrival the an
swer of Kennedy and Harris.
Erne's sudden appearance on the field
has/set the wise ones to a thoughtful
twisting of locks. They seem to think
that the fight will for a certainty be be
tween Frank Erne and Terry McGovern.
McGovern's theatrical dates make the
latter days of April particularly accepta
ble to him. and Frank Erne has an
nounced that he will be in this city until
May. Erne further states that he will
not fight under 133 pounds, and that he
has been promised, a return match by Mc-
Govern's manager. Erne at 133 pounds,
billed* to fight McGovern, will pack any
house In this city to windows and doors,
and this seems to have been contemplated
by shrewd Mr. Kennedy and astute Mr.
Harris. There need be no fear as to the
guarantee, for a percentage proportion
would far overtop any purse offered.
Kennedy Is scheduled to arrive In San
Francisco this evenlnc and he will no
doubt have much to say on prizefights in
general and McGovern in particular, but
Frank Erne's Arrival Means Much More Than
Is Exhibited on the Surface.

Awful Experience Under

Clayola.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 8.-Captain Albert
M. Willis and six men, crew of the
schooner Clayola, were rescued this morn
ing by the steamship James S. Whitney
from the dismasted wreck of the vessel,
floating, a veritable iceberg, in Long
Island Sound.
In a mass of ice on deck the famished
crew had cut a hole with axes and hud
dled together for mutual warmth. They
passed two days of terrible suffering. The
Whitney's captain saw their signal for
help and sent a boat crew to their rescue.
Getting into the sound early on the
morning of February 4. the Clayola en
countered a strong northwest gale and
being unable to make headway against It
the schooner anchored at 7 o'clock in the
evening, about two miles southeast of
Faulkner Island. The gale continued
throughout that night and increased in
fury the next day. It was bitterly cold
but none suffered much except the man
on the watch, the others remaining be
low. Toward evening, on February 5 the
gale had Increased so much that the
schooner began to drag her anchor. An
other was sent overboard, but even this
diu not stoD the vessel, and she was
driven eradually southeast for several
miles. Waves continually broka over her
decks and, freezing as they tell, two small
mountains of ice began growing fore and
aft.
The foremast was carried away at 8
o'clock, on Wednesday morning- and
heavy seas broke the hatches. A Hood of
water poured into the hold nnd froze
there, driving the crew from their quar
ters and destroying: all their provls'onÂ«
The water in the hold and the Ice forming
on the deck sank the. schooner gradually
until the deck amidshlp was almost on n.
line with the water. Ice mountains crow

heavy and to prevent her, rolling over the
mainmast was cut away at 9 o'clock

of the wreck somewhat, but in the tre

company and received his discharge at
the same time. We came here on the
Sheridan and took a room at the Cosmo

I had $197 in my vest pocket, and when
I got out of bed this morning Hall had
gone out. I discovered that my money
was gone and at once suspected him, as
he wanted to go East, but did not have
the money. I have searched for him all

years In the army to be in such a plight "
Murphy gave a description of Hall and

DENVER, Feb. S.â Dave Barry, light
weight champion of Canada, outpointed
Rufe Turner, light-weight champion of
the Pacific Coast, two to one, and was
given the decision at the end of a ten
round go before the Colorado Athletic As
sociation here to-night. Although Turner
Is a clever fighter. Barry blocked and
ducked away from his leads persistently.
Repeated Jabbing with his left to Turner's
mouth and eyes caused those members to
become badly swollen and the blood to
now freely. Barry would vary his sys
tem with occasional punches to the heart
or swings to the head which would dis
courage the colored boy. Turner tried per
sistently for a knockout by rushing to
a clinch and bringing over his right to the
jaw, but Barry's head would tly around
and away from the blow and the best
Turner could do was to land lightly on
the back of the Canadian's head or neck.
Turner stood Barry's left hand jabs
until the seventh round, when he began
to be dazed, and at the end of the eighth
started toward Barry's corner. He would
rouse himself at times, however, and fight
viciously, but without much judgment
and with but little effect except to tire
himself. Barry's clever defense was too
much for the negro.
Before the fight it was announced that
the winner would fight Kid McPartland
In two weeks from date, and that Fred
Russell of California had been matched
to fight Tom Sharkey some time in March.

At 9M3 she took a Burlington train for
Des Molnes, Iowa. She is accompanied
by the five women who helped her wreck
the Senate saloon at Topeka.
At the conclusion of her speech many
persons rushed forward to shake hands
with her. Many of her photographs were
sold at the door.
She made a bitter attack upon the land
lords, of the joints, saying that they are
as bad as the jointists.
Mrs. Nation made a characteristic talk.
She justified her crusade against the sa
l?.Â°J} b >" <- Itln S various passages from the
Bible. She said she did not hate the joint
ists; she loved them. But she hated the
business in which they were engaged and
meant to destroy it. She said she had
Just as much right to destroy the Joints
in Missouri as she had to destroy those of
Kansas. She declared that she would not
molest the joints of Kansas City, Mo., be
cause it is too large a city.
"I don't propose to bite off more than I
can chew." she said.

KANSAS CITY. Feb. S.â Mrs. Carrie
Nation, attended by a delegation of To
peka supporters and admirers, arrived
here late this afternoon and to-night ad
dressed a fair sized audience at the Acad
emy of Music.
While the women waited to wonder at
their leader's latest move, Mrs. Nation,
accompanied only by a reporter, made the
rounds of the joints to satisfy herself that
all were closed. The Jolntlsts, apparently
anticlpatlng a raid, had shut and barri
caded their door?, and at midnight Mrs.
Nation went to her home.
"I am not a coward." said Mrs. Nation
with emphasis; "I will go this minute
with any one woman and smash a Joint "
A dozen voices were raised: "I'll go; I'll
go." and for a moment it looked as If an
instant raid would result. But Mrs. Na
tion, soon collecting herself turned to
bantering her followers, told them that
she was tired, "that the Lord did not wish
her to go to-night,' 'and without further
ado left the room.
Suddenly, when everything seemed sat
isfactorily arranged for a terrific on
slaught, Mrs. Nation began putting on her
wraps and said she was going home. In
stantly her followers were in an uproar.
Mingled with expressions of surprise at
her quick change of front came words of
coridemnatlon. Finally one woman, who
had' spent the greater part of the day col
lecting hatchets and soliciting aid for the
crusaders, rushed to where Mrs. Nation
stood In the center of a group and shak
ing her fist In the Wichita lady's face,
shcuted excitedly:
"You are a coward, Mrs. Nation: you
are a coward."
TOPEKA. Kan;., Feb. S.â Mrs. N'ation
displayed the white feather last night at
a meeting of thirty of her followers, who.
armed with hatchets, had gathered In
secret to arrarige a night raid on Topeka
joints. Several male students at Wash
burn College were to have come to town
armed after midnight to personally take
part In the raid, and also to see that the
crusaders were not molested. The excite
ment at the meeting was intense, the
women planning minutely for the raid. It
was. decided to saunter out at 3 o'clock

terminates to-day. Secretary Milton S.
Latham said: "There is absolutely no
more truth in the report than there is
to the one that Tom Williams intends to
race all summer at Oakland."
However, from all accounts the situa
tion was entirely changed at a meeting
held by the directors of the San Fran
cisco Jockey Club on Thursday evening.
When Interviewed at Tanforan Park yes
terday Prince Poniatowski. president of
the San Francispo Jockey Club, said:
"Yes. we will race on at Tanforan Park
on Monday. Our association wishtd to
go along peacefully, but events have
transpired here in San Mateo County that
have convinced me that friends apparent
ly on the surface. were not our friends.
We wished to be very friendly with Mr.
Williams and the people of the other
track, but it seems now it cannot be.
Now I gues3 it will be a question as to
which has the longest bank roll." Con
tinuing, Prince Poniatowski said it was
not the intention of his club to issue the
Ingleside programme, and said he was in
ignorance as to how they had gained cir
culation. The conditions of the san Fran
cisco handicap read: For three-year-old?
and over eligible to the Burns handicap.
By subscription of $23 each. $75 additional
for starters, with $10,000 added. Of which
$2000 to second, $1000 to third, and fourth
to save entrance and starting fees.
Weights and declarations Thursday. Feb
ruary 14. One and a Quarter miles.
That the Tanforan Asscciation intends
to assume a most dictatorial position in
the Impending conflict was further in
stanced by a statement by Prince Ponia
towskl. Any owner who races his horses
at Oakland track will not be allowed to
race at Tanforan. Asked if this applied
to jockeys who accepted mounts at the
track over the bay, the Prince said it did.
Later on in the paddock the Jockeys
were addressed hy Prince Poniato-wski.
He said that riders under contract would,
of course, have to follow the dictation of
their employers, bur that the Tanforan
officials would expect all riders not under
contract to refuse mounts at Oakland. A
report gained some credence at the track
that the principal riders, among them
Burns. Henry. O'Connor. Bullman. Sloan
and Buchanan, had formed a combination
to boycott Oakland. At the downtown
hotels last night tMs was denied, and it
ran be stated rn excellent authority that
Burns. O'Connor Bullman and Buchanan
will all be seen in the saddle at Oakland
the coming week.
When seen in the office of the California
It was learned late last night that Tod
Sloan, with Prince Poniatowskl a* his
backer, had purchased Louis Ezell's crack
mare The Lady for $7000. If the daughter
of Hanover should be successful in win
ning thp San Francisco handicap then
Kzell Is to receive an additional 11000. As
Purns & Waterhouse. according to the
Tanforan edict, will not b<Â» allowed to
start any of their horses The Lady -will
be hard to beat.
To-night at 8:15 o'clock In Maple Hall.
Falace Hotel, Thomas H. Williams Jr.
will address the owners, bookmakers,
trainers and riders on the situation, and
all are invited to ba present.
The entries for Oakland track will close
on Sunday at 1 o'clock.
On October 10. 1SS3. an agreement was
entered into between the California Jock
ey Club on one side and the Western
Turf Association and Pacific Coast Jockey
Club on the other, calling for ah equal
division of dates, the terra of which, was
five years, the season to begin on or about
November 1 and cicse on or about May L
Thomas H. Williams Jr. signed the con
tract for the California Jockey Club.
Henry J. Crocker represented the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club and F. H. Green tno
Western Turf Association, and the offi
cial seals of all three organizations were
affixed to the document- The agreement
was appro\-ed by the Turf Congress,
which sent a committee out hero at thÂ«
time composed of Captain J. H. Rees and
W. F. Schulte to mediate matters. When
the San Francisco Jockey Club leased
Inpleside and Tanforan tracks, it neces
sarily assumed all liabilities incurred by
the tracks mentioned. Prince Ponlatow
ski was inclined to doubt that the San
Francisco Jockey Club was in duty bound
to respect any compact made in the past,
which statement lacks backing up with
facts.
If. however, the San Francisco Jockey
Club does race on Monday next, you can
state thai the California Jockey Club will
race through to th>Â» end of the season,
terminating May 1."
Jockey Club and Interviewed by members
of the press last night. Thomas H. Wil
liams Jr. said he was taken completely
by surprise, and could not believe the
rumor to be true that the San Francisco
Jockey Club would break Its agreement.
As yet. Pfesfdent Williams said, his club
had received no official notification that
war had been declared by the other racing
association, and professed to stlli have
doubts that such was the situation. "I
cannot believe." the Oakland president
said, "that a titled gentleman such as
Prince Poniatowskl is. respected by the
public and a true lover of sport, will
break faith with this club, for nothing
good could come from such action.

A feature suggesting that Mr. Carnegie
had in mind the sale of his company at
the time it was chartered in New Jersey
is the peculiar clause in the charter pro
viding that the directors of the company
may dispose of the property of the com
pany as an entirety. It Is this clause in
the charter that the men who are at pres
ent engaged in financing the deal are tak
ing advantage of. If, as now seems cer
tain, Mr. Carnegie is to receive $1500 for
each $1000 share of his stock, the transfers
In his case alone will be the eaulvalent of.
nearly $130,000,000. Inasmuch as the great
steel magnate's holdings at present
amount to $S6,000.000. If, as seems prob
able, the minority holders are to be looked
after by Mr. Morgan's syndicate the fin
anciering will involve the eaulvalent of
$240,000,000.
The statement by Judge Gary, however,
throws little light upon the details of the
preat transaction that is now In progress,
and it is probable that actual official in
formation in this respect will not be ob
tainable until the deal is really completed.
The statement was. however, the subject
of much guessing. It apparently confirms
the general Impression that all the "Mor
gan companies" are actively Interested in
the transaction and while nothlns was
said as to the American Steel and "Wire
Company, the fact that counsel of the
company attended the conferences be
tween President Gary and Mr. Morgan
seems to leave little doubt that the nego
tiations under way include the steel and
wire consolidation.' Incidentally it is
hinted that interesting developments may
occur at the annual meeting of that corpo
ration on February 19. The "Moore com
panies" are not generally supposed to have
any interest in the financial side of the
new deal, but it is believed that they will
be disposed to work in harmony with the
Morgan Interests, at least while the mar
ket conditions continue favorable. It ap
pears not unlikely, however, that the
Pennsylvania Steel Company may be In
cluded in the "community of ownership"
plans, a theory that gains some color from
the report that Pennsylvania Railroad
capitalists are to have an interest In the
financing of the current deal.
, NEW YORK, Feb.' S.â The new develop
ments to-day in connection with the ne
gotiations, touching the transfer of :^he
control of the Carnegie Steel Company to
J.' P. Morgaiijjfand ,,his associates -were,
first,- that Mr. "Carnegie is to receive $1500
for each* $1000 of Tils stock; second, that 1
minority holders who desire to sell will
receive thejsame. terms as those given to
Mr. .Carnegie; â¢third, that the present
stage of the negotiations contemplates the
formation of a new corporation, whose
bonds" will play a large part in the price
to be paid Mr. Carnegie, and fourth, the
first public announcement in connection
with pending negontitions of an official,
character, consisting of a statement by
E. II. Gary, president of the Federal Steel
Company, confirming the news that J. P.
Morgan is planning the acquisition of the
properties of some of the largest iron and
steel companies of this country.

For some davs there have been rumors
aflcat that trouble was brewing between
the two clubs, but was passed as idle gos
sip. The first intimation and first shot
from the Tanforan camp as indicative
that the battle was on was the partial
distribution on Thursday of programme
books for the week beginning February
11, announcing that the races would be
decided at Ingles'.de track. This was in
Itself mystifying, as Ingleside track is
still under the ban, no action of the Su
pervisors having as yet thrown wide it3
gates. When questioned earlier in thi
week as to whether the Tanforan asso
ciation intended to race on at the con
clusion of the three weeks' meeting, which
CARNEGIE CLEANS
UP A VAST SUM
Some took occasion to exult over the
announcement, while the more staid and
experienced followers of the turf were In
clined to look upon the Impending con
flict with many misgivings for the future
of the sport. The San Francisco handi
cap is open only to horses eligible to the
Burns handicap, the stellar feature of the
coming Oakland meeting, and, of course,
is aimed to detract from the latter as a
drawing card.
This means they will race through the
thirty-five days allowed under the terms
of the prohibitory ordinance Â»passed re
cently by the Supervisors of San Mateo
County, which provides that the racing
season shall be limited to thirty-five days
in any one year. This ordinance went
into effect on the ath inst/ At the expira
tion of this period the San Francisco
Jockey Club will be barred from racing in
San Mateo County until February 5, 1902.
At the conclusion of the third race the
following terse statement was posted on
the announcement board of the San Mateo
County track:
"Racing will be continued Monday at
Tanforan Park. On Saturday, February
16, San Francisco handicap, $10,000 added
money."
The strained situation and threatened
conflict between the rival racing associa
tions, the California Jockey Club and the
San Francisco Jockey Club, has finally
come to a focus. "Taking the bull by the
horns." the San Francisco Jockey Club
threw down the gauntlet at Tanforan
Park yesterday and by its action has un
doubtedly precipitated a struggle that will
be fought with desperate stubbornness on
both sides.

herself in the preparation of jellies and

Francisco. t v^jr jayg^Of course such a construction as that cannot stand,
for it would be an absurdity to dissolve half of Parlia
ment. It must be dissolved as a whole or not at all.
That much appears to be conceded on both sides.
Consequently the lawyers and the statesmen are now
puzzling their brains to find out a means whereby the
act oflS67 can be made operative in Ireland and in
Scotland to the extent of continuing the terms of
their members of Parliament equally with the British
and the Welsh, without at the same time making the
other provisions of the act operative in those por
tions of the kingdom.
BRITISH statesmen and lawyers are puzzling
over a parliamentary tangle which, like the
Gordian knot, will probably have to be cut, for
there seer.i> no easy way to untangle it. It is a ques
tion of whether or no Parliament was dissolved by
the death of the late Queen. If the dissolution oc
curred with her death, then of course there is now no
Parliament, and one of the King's duties will be to
call one immediately. If, on the other hand. Parlia
ment holds over, there will be no need for an imme
diate election, and the Salisbury Ministry will be safe
for a year at least.
The doubt grows out of a clause in the reform act
of 1S67. By that act it is provided among other
things that the death of a sovereign shall not cause
a dissolution of Parliament. It happens, however,
that the main intent end purpose of the law was to
make certain changes with regard to the qualifications
of electors in England and Wales, but not in the
other portions of the United Kingdom, and accord
ingly it contains a clause declaring that its provisions
shall not be operative as to Irish and to Scotch con
stituencies. It is claimed by one side that by a strict
construction of the law the members from* Scotland
and from Ireland are thus left under the old rule and
their terms expire with the sovereign, and that it is
only the British and the Welsh members' who now
hold over.
(\ PARLIAMENTARY TANGLE.
sometimes do their business. The reform act of 1S67
was one of the most thoroughly discussed subjects
that have been submitted to the British public for
many a year. It was carefully drawn by able lawyers,
and was subjected to the scrutiny of equally able law
yers on the other side. Yet at the time no one ap
pears to have foreseen the complication that has
arisen. It is clear, therefore, that there are times
when even the brightest intellects do not understand
the full purport of their own words.
The chief executive of this city has declared under
oath that efforts were made by the authorized repre
sentatives of a local newspaper to induce him to bar
ter the Police Department for political favors, to make
of the Fire Department a mammoth engine of politi
cal corruption and to defeat an honest Judge out of
renomination. These facts certainly suggest them
selves as the most significant which could merit the
attention of the Grand Jury which is now in session.
The Southern Pacific Company has decided to is
sue no more passes for the use of politicians or for
political favors either past or prospective. The au
thorities of Sacramento ought to honor the company
with a vote of thanks for deliverance from a mob of
dangerous characters and invaders.

PERSONAL MENTION.
There is. in tact, much of gratification among whites
North and South over the progress the negro has
made. The recent exclusion of so many colored
voters from the polls can hardly be more than a pass
ing: folly. As the negro advances in wealth and citt
renship be will win Lack his rightful place in our
political system. The great majority of the Ameri
can people will as far as lies in their power cordially
respond to Mr. White's earnest appeal for his race:
"Help him to overcome his weaknesses, punish the
rrime-cornn:itling: class by the courts of the land,
neasere the standard of the race by its best material.
cease to mold prejudicial and unjust public sentiment
against him, and. my word for it. he will learn to sup
port, hold up the hands of and join in with that
political party, that institution, whether secular or
religious, in every community where he lives, which
i> destined to do the greatest good to the greatest
number. Obliterate race hatred, party prejudice, and
help us to achieve nobler ends, greater results, and be
come more satisfactory citizens to our brother in
u sue.
A showing of that kind is certainly creditable to the
b'^ck race, but Mr. White should have noted that it
is creditable to the white race also, for had the negro
been 50 much oppressed and wronged as it is the
custom of some people to claim he would not have
had an opportunity to achieve 50 much for himself.
The white people of neither the Northern nor the
Southern States have done all for the negro thev
might, bat they have done much. The great oppor
tunities of American life have not been whollj- open
to the colored man. but most of them have. Not
long ago Booker Washington, after a visit to Europr.
stated in a speech at Atlanta that after studying the
conditions there ar.d here he had come to the conclu
sion that the negro has a better chance to rise in life
:n Georgia than the average untrained white laborer
has in any country of Continental Europe.
Mr. White's argument is that despite the obstacles
j.laced in their way and the well ni^li universal preju
dice asainst them the negroes of the country arc
ja.v.iiiy advancing in v.ialth, culture and morality. In
reviewing what has been accomplished by them in the
thirty- five years that have elapsed since their emanci
pation he said: "Since that time we have reduced the
illiteracy of the race at least 45 per cent. We have
written and publishe i nearly 500 books. We have
nearly 300 ne.vspapcr?, three of which are dailies. We
have now in practice over jooo lawyers and a cor
respondinp number of doctors. We have accumulated
over $1^.000.000 worth of school property and about
S40.ooo.otx3 worth of church property. We have about
140.000 farms and hones, valued in the neighbor
hood of 5750.000.000, Mid personal property valued ?i
about ?'â¢ re -ooo .000. We have raised about $11,000,000
for educational purposes, and the property per capita
for every colored man. woman and child in the United
States is estimated at $75. We are operating success
fully several banks, commercial enterprises among
our people in the southland, including one silk
mill and one cotton factory. We have 32,000 teach
ers in the schools of the country: we have built, with
the aid of our friends, about .20.000 churches, and sup
port seven colleges, seventeen academics, fifty high
schools, tire law schools, five medical schools and
tvcr.ty-rive theological seminaries. We have over
600,000 acres of land in the South alone. The couon
produced, mainly l>y black labor, has increased from
4.G69.770 bales in 1S60 to 11.235.000 in 1S90. All this
we have done tinder the most adverse circumstances."

most attention and is most deserving of it ii

The Call repeats the charge that Phelan entered into an unlawful compact with
A. M. Lawrence of the Examiner to appoint Lawrence's candidate to the office of Chief
of Police. It offers to prove the charge in court if Mayor Phelan dare to appeal to such
a tribunal. He now stands convicted of lying by his own testimony, and we can convict
him of further lying if ottered an opportunity to do so.
"When the reorganization of the Police Department occurred and Sullivan was ap
pointed, the Examiner people were dissatisfied. They were enraged at the charges laid
at their door and Esola's* and demanded that he be appointed, if only for a day."
Xow we have already quoted from Mayor Phelan's open letter the statement:
"At no time was I asked to procure his (Esola r s) promotion."
There is one point more. In his testimony Mayor Phelan said:
Should the investigating committee have any desire to learn how much of falseness
there is in the statement that the Mayor had made no promise to keep Maxwell in office,
it can easily obtain witnesses to prove that he did. Doubtless the Examiner itself could
furnish the witnesses.
"That is one motive showing animus, and another was the dismissal of George Max
well from the position of Secretary of the Fire Commission. He was notoriously known as
the agent of Sam Rainey, and I thought it best for the interests of the city and the Fire
Department to cut off his head. After I had gotten rid of him the Examiner claimed that I
had not only made a bargain with it to keep Maxwell, but also not to touch the Chief of
the Fire Department. This was not true."
In these instances we have the Mayor's testimony contradicted by the Mayor's let
ter. There are othei of his statements under oath that can be refuted â not directly
by his own words indeed, but by the word of more reliable men. For example, he stated
in his testimony that the present investigation has been due to the malice of the Exam
iner, and after assigning .the rejection of Esola as one motive for that malice, he went on
to add:
Here we have in the letter an assertion of autocratic power to remove the Chief oi
Police, and in the testimony under oath a weak evasion in the plea that it is a matter of
doubt whether or no he has such power.
"If a mistake is made I can correct it. The Commissioners are responsible to me
and I to the "people for ihe administration of the Police Department, and I will personally
see that the Chief, whoever he may be, will enforce the laws, detect crime and bring of
fenders to justice. Any compromise, so common in the past, with crime shall be speedily
rebuked in the person of the officer.".
Now in that same open letter to the public, published in the Examiner of January
17. 1900, Mayor Phelan by way of assuring the people that his administration would be
a good one even if an incompetent man were made Chief of Police, said:
Thus \vc have the Mayor over his own signature in a public letter declaring at one
time that Esola merited the place and was well qualified for it; and now under oath de
claring that Esola is a man of no education, and that trie office of Chief of Police is too big
for him. That, however, is not the only contradiction that involves him. When ques
tioned by Coinmittecman Laird concerning his power under the charter to remove offi
cers who <lo not enforce the law. the Mayor said:
"I can appoint and dismiss the Police Commissioners. I have recommended the ap
pointment of a Chief of Police. Whether I have the power to remove the Chief of Police is
a question. There are two views of that matter. The charter gives me no power to com
mand the police excepting in times of riot."
"Esola's name was mentioned as worthy of promotion in the Police Department on
account of his ambition to serve in some larger capacity, his gentlemanly demeanor and
his excellent record. He was young, vigorous and had the confidence of those who knew
him well. At no time, however, was I asked to procure his promotion, but I am not una
ware of the fact that his friends expected for him some recognition in the line of promo
tion in case I was elected to office. There was no one else in the department who was
prominently mentioned or seemed particularly well qualified for the place."
That was the statement under oath before the investigating committee. Now on
January \y, 1900, Mayor phelan published in the Examiner an open letter replying at
great length to charges made by The Call, and in that letter he said:
"After the charges made against Esola had been disposed of, the commission felt
reluctant about appointing him. In fact, it was found impossible to appoint Esola. He
is a man of no education, and the position that he had held in the Police Department had
always been a small one. The position of Chief of Police was in fine too big in which to
It will be remembered that when Phelan was organizing his administration under
the new charter. The Call charged that before the election he had entered into a compact
with A. Mi Lawrence of the Examiner to give Lawrence the- appointment of the Chief of
Police^ and that Lawrence had dictated the nomination of Esola: and that as a result of
that exposure the Police Commission refused to elect Esola. When questioned about
those charges and oilier matters in connection with the Esola affair, Mayor Phelan said
on Thursday: \
Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦" Â¦ " 'Â¦ Â» . i :Â¦<â¢---Â¦ V* ' 4
MAYOR PHELAN'S testimony given before the Assembly investigating com
mittee is another illustration of the truth of the old proverb, "Liars should have
long memories.'' In answering .the questions put to him the Mayor endeavored
to make out o good case for himself in the present instance, but in doing so forgot the
statements made by himself in times past, and the result was an amount of self-contradic
tion that has all the outward signs of perjury.

An Unusual Punishment.
A man convicted in Vermont of tha
murder of a Deputy Sheriff has Just been
sentenced to serve a tfrm of two years'
Imprisonment at hard labor, th* last threo
months belnjr in solitary confinement, and
at the expiration of that term he is to
be handed. This seems in the nature of
a cruel and unusual punishment. Fancy
the torture to which this man will be
subjected by the knowledge of his fate,
two year* of it. The provision of hard
labor for the full two years would not
have been 50 harsh as the refined cruelty
of placing him in solitary confinement for
the last three months of his life. There
may be a diversity of opinion regarding
the use of capital punishment, but no
sentence yet noted has exceeded In
deliberate cruelty this* one from Ver
mont.âPittsburK Press.
Christian Endeavor Growth.
Twenty years a*o last Saturday the first
Young People's Society of Christian En
deavor was formed In Portland. Me. Its
constitution was . printed by hand on a
hectograph pad for local distribution.
From the WMiston Church the Idea soon
spread to neighboring churches in Port
land and elsewhere. Since then aWO.Om
copies of the constitution and lno.uw.Cy)
copies of the pledge have been printed in
at least sixty different lansrunpes. They
have been translated into all the lan
guages of Europe, into the chief laneuep*
of India. Burmah and China, into the bar
barous tongues of the South Seas, ana
into the tribal speech of the North" Ameri
can Indians. The movement has girdled

forces for good in the world.â Chicago

New York's Huge Salary List.
New York City's roll-call of employes,
which now carries 4S.00O names, and with
details as to their salaries and addresses
fills a book of 30S pages â rjuite a city di
rectory in itselfâ continues to cut an In
creasingly large figure in the budget.
Within the last six months of 19ft) salary
increases amounting to $233,843 were made.
Increases of school teachers' salaries and
of policemen advanced trÂ» higher grades
were not included In thia amount. For
the first six month* of littf) salaries were*
increased W'H'.STa. not counting senool anil
police salary increases. So that for the
whole year VMi there was an arbitrary
advance of salaries, not due to any* man
datory State law of $713.22*. The city's to
tal salary lift, which called for $34,717,961 in.
1S99, went up to over HÂ».rt0O.0OO last year,
and for 1901 will undoubtedly be many
millions higher and is likely to swallow
half the entire budget of nearly one hun
dred million^.â New York World.
For "Uniform pivorce Law.
The American Bar Association has
drafted a uniform divorce act. to be sub
mitted to the various State Legislatures.
It provides, first, that no divorce shall be
granted in any State for a cause that was
not ground of divorce in the State where
the cause arose. It demands also resi
dence for a year before suit can bÂ«
brought If the cause arose, within the
State, otherwise for two years, and re
quires that the defendant shall be per
sonally served with notice, with certain
obvious exceptions. Further, "no di
vorce shall . be granted solely upon de
fault, nor so'ely npon admissions by tho
pleadings, nor except upon hearing before
the court in open session." It allows
either party to remarry. The fact that
legislation deals with subjects affecting
women so Intimately as divorce, empha
elzes the need that women should have a
voice and vote in the matter. There is an
obvious incongruity in such questions be
ing dealt with exclusively by men. â

XVII.
Let us return to the Persian empire as
It was in the sixth century before Christ,
the period when the semilegendary kings
bore sway in Rome, when the learned ty
rant Pisistrastus rules at Athens and
when the Jews were ending their captlvity
on the banks of the Euphrates. It was
then the most extensive, the best or
ganized and the most wisely administered
state which Asia had seen.
But already active in it were germ3 of
decay. The martial virtues of the Medes
and Persians, stalwart children of the
hills, their temperance, frugality and
energy, were undermined. Even their re
ligion, which their magi had attained on
the mountains in the contemplation of the
stars, could not save them. Raised sud
denly and without preparation to un
bounded affluence, they were like paupers
who have drawn the grand prize In a. lot
tery or have fallen heirs to an unlooked
for estate.
The conquered civilization of the Tigns-
Euphrates basin thus took a speedy re
venge upon its conquerors. The empire
sank Into an immense. Inert, though still
living, mass. The invasions of Greece
it attempted demonstrated its inability
to attack. Xenophon and his ten thou
sand, marching across Asia Minor to Cun
axa. demonstrated Its Incapacity for Belf
defense. No nation and no ruler ever
fell more inglorlously than did the Per
sian empire and it3 last sovereign when
assailed by Alexander and his handful of
Greeks. The Greco-Asiatic kingdoms,
which arose under crowned generals after
the death of the great> cenqueror, were
determined by the natural conditions
which the rivers and the mountains Ira
pese. .
Asiatic geography had overborne Alex
ander himself. The twelve altars which,
according to tradition, he erected to mark
the extreme limit of his triumphant
course, had their location Indicated by
geography. He had pushed on where no
other European nad ever been. But even
he, the unconquerable, could push no
farther.
The Roman succeeded the Greek, but
the base from which he made his attack
was farther away. Rome weakened as
the distance increased from her vital
center, the Mediterranean Sea. Her le
gions carried their eagles up to the
sources of the Euphrates and Tigris and
to the borders of the Syrian Desert west
of old Chaldaea. Over that territory,
mostly embraced In Asia Minor and Syria,
the arms and diplomacy of the two con
tinents have contended ever since.
Thus far we have paid chief attention to
two inseparable physical factors, the
mountains and rivers; the mountains
as determining the nature of the rivers
in their volume and direction; the rivers
as determining the fertility and extent of
the alluvial piains. There remains a third
factor to consider, hardly less Important,
the desert or steppe.
The steppe is itself a consequence of
climate and soil. Almost all Asia is situ
ated in the temperate zone. Only a por
tion of Its three southern peninsulas are
south of the tropic. But the Tlan Shan
and Kuenluen stand in the way of the
summer winds freighted with moisture
from the eastern aeas. In consequence
little rain falls, west of those ranges, over
an area measured by hundreds of. thou
sands of square miles. Nor are the con
ditions greatly different through an enor
mous tract south of the Altai Mountains.
In winter the prevailing winds are from
the mainland toward the ocean and are
naturally dry. The parched soil or sand,
wind-blown, prevents the growth of treea,
in which both the steppe and the des
ert are wanting. The difference between
them is one of degrees, the desert being
the drier, drearier and more desolate of
the two. Yet some rivers from the moun
tains, before they lose themselves in the
vands or reach the brackish inland Aral
Sea. form oases in the wilderness or af
ford means . for irrigation along their
banks. Still the population of the steppe
can never be relatively numerous nor can
it have its habitation permanent and
fixed. The people born upon It must be
r.omads from the start and never can at
tain a high degree of civilization. The
region must react upon character and
render its children as unreliable and as
merciless as their sands. Their own lives
and the lives of others can possess no
sacredness and little value. Trained by
the nature amid which they are born, in
war it is their pastime not only to kill
and conquer but to destroy. Only a child
of the desert could have boasted that,
where his horse's hoof fell, no grass ever
grew.
Protected by their encircling- mountains
in the Infancy of the race, the favored
dwellers in the river basins could mul
tiply and grow prosperous in peace. But
as time went on. rumors of fabulous
wealth and luxury were sure to reach the
nomadic tribes in what was then an outer
world. At last even ramparts and bar
riers, thousands of feet in height, could
not shut out their cupidity. Always on
the part of the nomadic invaders there
was the passion not only to possess but
to ruin. The later of these outpourings
from the desert are recorded In history.
They are personified to us in the names
of leaders such as 'Attila, Genghis Khan
and Tamerlane. Despite all 4he" massa
cres of which we have an account in va
rious times and among various peoples,
the bloody ferocity which marked the ca
reer of these last two leaders is un
equaled. Over his tomb at Samarcand is
now written the sullen epitaph which
sums up the spirit of Tamerlane. It
reads: "If I were alive the world would
not be glad."
Before we take up the Asia of to-day,
there is one country apart, to the south
west which has a history distinctively
its own. In politics it has affected the
welfare of mankind more than has done
any other portion of tne Asiatic conti
nent In religious influence it has been
inferior only to Judea. It concentrates all
it was and has been in, the life and deeds
of a single man. Since Christ was born
at Bethlehem no other human being has
wielded so laree and permanent an au
thority, has cast so large a shadow, aa
Mohammed, the camel driver of Mecca,
the prophet of Arabia.
Arabia is an Immense rectangular block
of land, over a million square miles In
area, suspended between the Red Sea, the
Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the
Gulf of Oman. It is attached to the con
tinent only on the north. Northward Its
boundaries-are as indefinite as the horizon
and as shifting as the sand. It is shut off
from the rest of the world by the terrible
desert which leaches westward from the
head of the Persian Gulf. Arabia Petraea,
wherein the children of Israel wandered,
Is only a small portion of the peninsula.
Until less than 1300 years ago the Arabs
were split into innumerable and petty hos
tile tribes. The great majority as nomads
roamed over the deserts and the high pla
teau which form the greater part of the
interior. Some more fortunate Inhabited
villages and towns in Arabia Felix, on the
long. narrow""strip of land which borders
the Red Sea. The population could not
have been much less than 3.000.000, but
among them there was no tie of any sort,
either of language, religion, ancestry or
The â¢ achievement of Mohammed was
that with the fire of a great idea he weld
ed all those warring elements into one or
ganic whole.' Statesman no less than
prophet, he built the tribesmen into a na
tion. Inflaming them wtth the spirit of
military ardor and religious zeal, he sent
them from their desert confines to the
political and. religious subjugation .of the
world. The resistless torrent of the new
invasion ' spread victoriously up to the
shores of the Caspian Sea and submerged
every faith and government from the In
dus through Northern Africa to the At
lantic. Arabia from its seclusion exer
cised a more widespread domination than
had Greece and Rome. Islam, the creed
so recently revealed, counted more adher
ents than Christianity. . .
Â¦The results of a convulsion may be seen
long after the passing of the earthquake
shock. The crusaders wert but an episode
in the unended line of consequences that
have followed the outburst from Arabia.
No other cause has so modified the cur
rent - of subsequent history. Few other
causes are so potent to-day.
It ' would be a stimulating and fruitful
task to linger- upon the war geography of
Asia as determining its life and history
during the middle ages and in modern
times. Progress in civilization is indicated
by the degree wherein man rises superior
to and utilizes the forces of nature. Yet
this superiority la only relative, Man Is
still for the most part the creature ot cir
cumstances. The roads along which his
armies march, the fields whereon they
battle, the limits of nascent states, the
occupations of their Inhabitants, the apti
tudes and inclinations of dwellers upon
certain territoryâ concerning these and
kindred things, nature by soil and climate
and elevation and every physical charac
teristic uttered her fiat at the creation of
the world.
There are certain matters of special in
terest to rtmark aÂ» we contemplate the
present map of Asia.
One Is the unequal distribution of popu
lation, some regions being hardly occupied
by man and ethers being crowded almost
beyond their ability to afford support. In
all Asia there are supposed to be 850.000.0C">
human beings, or fiftv-slx persons to a
square mile. Yet 700.000,000 persons, flftecn
6lxteenths of this overwhelming host, are
packed at the rate of 117 per square mile
Into China and India, which together in
clude only two-flfths of the entire Asiatic
territory. On the 1.300,000 square miles
which make up China proper, 3S3.C00.000
persons, or 294 to the square mile, manage
to exist. But the remaining 2.SCO.0OO
square miles of the Chinese empire sup
port only 19.00O.C0O souls, or not quite seven
to the square mile. Mountainous Persia
has 650.000 square miles of territory and
84>X).OOO people, or twelve to the squarÂ«
mile. Hence we see that the relations of
domicile have remained unchanged from
antiquity. The river basins, like magnets,
Ftill attract agglomerations of human life,
while only sparse and scattered tribes
linger on the mountain or steppe.
Another striking fact is the deflnJtenesi
of the boundaries. The physical mio
might almost serve as the political map,
with so much docility have politieaJ sys
tems adopted the limits which physical
considerations have prescribed. There is
nothing here of that artificial delineation
of frontier, of following parallels of lati
tude and meridians, which European
agreements and conventions have ir-ad?
familiar on the map of Africa. Modern
conquest has sometimes Ignored natural
landmarks and sought to divide the in
divisible. Thus H.u38ta. Perria and thÂ«Â»
Ottoman empire each holds a third of
Mount Ararat. Thus the western pow
ers, withisolated possessions, dot the
coast of Uhina. Generally, however, it
is the flowing river or the mountain lin^
that traces where one dominion. end3 and
another hpeins.
Another fact, morei Impressive and supr
gestlve. is the weakness and paralysi3
which has fallen on such of the Asiatic
states as still profess a nominal Indepen
dence. What cne is there whose theory
of government, whose system of education
or whose military prowess, the rest of
the world regards? " The island empire of:
Japan is the sole exception. But only thÂ«
veneering of western ideas, which she haa
assumed as to administration and miil
tary affa1r3, gives her dignity. Japan is
respectable and strons among the nations
only so far as she ceased to be Asiatic.
Her future Is secure onlv on the essential
condition that there be no relapse into
the Oriental torpor from which aha
Â¦was roused by Commodore Perry and th<5
American scuadron In 1S53. The other
"independent" states are Persia. Afghan
istan, Siam, China and Korea. The Otto
man empire, though Asiatic in origin and
faith and Asiatic in most of its territory,
has Its capital In Europe and Is to be
reckoned a European power.
The last fact to recojmlze Is this: Asia.
with the exception of Japan, has already
passed or ia fast passing into European
ownership and control. There are few
Islands anywhere alonj? its extended coast
over which there doea not float a forelsm
flaff. There Is no Asiatic court in which
the influence cf some foreian state Is not
, predominant. Persia and Korea are sub
servient to Russia. Siam to Great Brit
ain. Afghanistan to hoth. and China first
to Russia and then to .ill the powers. Not
one of these states dares perform an offi
cial act or take an official step of whlcli
Its "protector" does not appnn-e. But by
far the largest portion of the continent
Is under the direct administration of
European rulers and la reckoned their
territorial possession. The acquisitions
of Great Britain and Russia span a spac?.
5000 miles In breadth, between the Arctic
and Indian oceans, and meet in th<Â» Pa
mirs. Over the Himalayas and the AJtais
with the certainty of fate they Impend
on China, which not oniy they, but FrancÂ©
and Germany, menace from the sea. How
lonp Korea. Persia. Afghanistan and Siaitt
shall retain a quasi-independent existence
depends upon foreign procrastination
rather than on themselves.
Nor Is this progressive march of western
mastery and assimilation to be deplored.
One may lament the deceit and violence
by which it is too often accomplished, but
Its ultimate outcome is the advancement
of humanity. To India and to Turkestan,
to whatever Asiatic spot the pun carriage)
of the Englishman or of the Russian haa
apDroached. there has come with it such
order and tranquillity, such safety of llfo
and property, surh equality of rights and
such protection before the law. as that
portion of the continent has never known.

Beats the Toyo Kisen Kaisha's Hongkong Maru More Than
Six Hours in the Twenty-One Hundred Mile
Run Between San Francisco and Honolulu.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Zealandia and the Japanese mall
steamship Nippon Maru arrived
from Honolulu . yesterday. The
latter vessel made the' better run
and camo in ahead of her usual time. It
was only a question of turning the tables,
however.* The Zealandia is one of the best
preserved of the old class of ships, while
the Nippon Maru is a modern vessel with
a guaranteed speed of seventeen knots.
Â£he did not run up to her "guarantee" on
this occasion and the Zealandia beat her
to dock.
In connection with this run comes up
that of the Sonoma and Hongkong Maru.
Both vessels left here for Honolulu on the
same day, but the Hongkcng Maru had a
two hours 1 start. The latter vessel has
"found herself," being nearly two years
in commission, while the O*ceanic Com
pany's boat is practically on her .maiden
trip. She left here two hours after the
Hongkong Maru and beat her four hours
into port. As the Sonoma holds the rec
ord between Philadelphia and San Fran
cisco the fact that she beat a seasoned
seventeen-knot mail boat six hours in a
2100-mile run is all the more to her credit.
The Zealandia docked asÂ» soon as she
passed the quarantine, while the Nippon
Maru was held at the station for several
houra. Those who came up on the Zea
landia were:
B. F. DHUngham and wife. Mr. Hetneberg

NEW SCHOONERS COMMISSIONED
Three "Will Sail on Their Maiden
Voyages "Within Ten Days.
The schooner Maurice came down from
Turner's yard yesterday and will be fitted
out for the Tahiti trade. Her owner has
not yet accepted her. but doubtless all dif
ficulties will be straightened out and the
smart little schooner will go away loaded
with freight. She is to run among the
Tahiti Islands and her headquarters will
be at Papeete.
Besides the Maurice, the Alvena for the
Gardner Mill Company and the Alumna
for the Simpson Lumber Company are
ready to so into commission and will sail
from Coos Bay and Eureka in a few days
with full cargoes. These vessels are only
the advance guard of the new fleet that
will be launched and commissioned this
month.
m
Movements of Transports.
The army officials are in a quandary just
now. The volunteers have to be brought
home and two of the transports are "laid
up." The Sherman has to be overhauled
and the Warren will take six weeks to os
put In shape for an emergency run, T l ie
Sheridan goes out on the 16th inst. with
two battalions of Infantry, but what ve*>
eel will follow her on March 1 Is a mys
tery. Should the Meadc get in on time
she may be rushed out again, but if she
is late then no transport will sail on the
regular bi-weekly trip. Only work that Is
absolutely necessary will be done on th'j
Sherman and Warren and they will bo
got ready for sea as quickly aa possible.
Sealing Hen Protest.
There are more than thirty British peal-
ingr vessels at work alone the coast, while
a schooner from San FVanclsco dare not
lower a boat. Uncle Sam has prohibiteJ
the taking of seals and the Britishers are
making hay while the sun shines. Yester
day rive of the fleet were in California
ports refitting-.
The Borealis was In Drakes Bay wait
ing for a new crew to be sent overland
from Sausallto. The Vera (formerly the
American schooner Halycon) and three
others were in Monteray Bay wating for
hunters, while half a dozen more are at
Santa Barbara. All tneSc vessels hunt
nine miles off shore and thus evade the
law. but while they can clear on a sealing
cruise an American vessel cannot. Conse
quently the whole business is in the hands
of the British and the 1 men who have tho
Prebyloft Island concession.
"Water Front Notes.
James Robertson of 4ol Bryant street
met with e peculiar accident yesterday.
He and four other men were engaged In

four of his assistants were thrown lnt<5
the bay. Robertson feil on a floating pile
and had his rcalp bally lacerated. He
was treated at the Harbor Hosoltal.

The managers of tho Mardl Gra3 have
in mind that there was a crush at supper
last year. Pressure of the guests im
peded tho waiters and prolonged the de
lay of service. The caterer was not equal
to tho task of serving tho throng. The
â¢ervlce xvus wretched and many of the
waiters were indifferent. If not insolent.
Special efforts will be made this year to
serve tho supper in well regulated fash
ion. Two hundred guests will be served,
in rooms on the main floor adjoining tho
Searles gallery. Extra doorways leading
from the kitchen to the basement rooms
will be provided. A separate department
for the service of wine has been estab
lished. Captain Fletcher believes that
the new plans will enable an intelligent
and capablo caterer to seat all the guests
promptly and serve every one of the 800
guests without unusual delay.

EoL 5 OW e the Pfflce. and Al Col, who
has been filling the place under appoint
ment from the Board of Supervisors, will
appeal to the Supreme Court. The deci
sion will have an important bearing on th-?

snip. Details in this case are similar to
tnose decided by Judge Rhodes.
Brother and Sister Insane.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 8.â A sad case of senile
dementia was brought to light to-day by
the commitment of Patrick Durkin and
Mary Carroll, brother and sister, to the
Agnews Asylum. The two old people haÂ«l
occupied a ramshackle adobe on South
Market street and exposure and lack of
food and care has undermined their
health. Both are natives of Ireland.
Durkin la SO years of age and hla sister 74.
LONDON, Feb. 8.â It has been learned
that a reply will shortly be sent to the
United States concerning the Nic
aragua x canal project. It will
not comply with the Senate's de
mands. Neither will It be in the nature of
a flat refusal, though for the purposes of
Immediate construction It will be tanta
mount to such a refusal. It will consist
mainly In a counter-proposal or proposals,
likely to necessitate extended negotia
tions. The nature of the proposal Is not
yet ascertainabte. Lord Pauncefote will
likely be the medium through which the
answer will be sent and by whom the
subsequent negotiations will chiefly be
conducted.
In British official opinion it is likely that
several months will elapse before the maU
ter- reaches a conclusion, by which time
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty will have
elapsed, on the basis of the Senate's
amendments. The British counter-pro
posals are now being formulated, and it is
hoped an entirely new agreement, satis
factory to both countries eventually, will
be reached.
WASHINGTON,. Feb. S.â So far as can
be ascertained the administration has not
had any Intimation of the counter-pro
posals the London dispatch says will be
made In the matter of the Nicaragua
canal project. There is a feeling of regret
that the British. Government has felt con
strained, to adopt such a cpurse, as the
hope was entertained that the amend
ments to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
might have been accepted in the spirit in
which they were made.
Senator Morgan, when Informed to-night
of the new stand taken by Great Britain
said he believed that If Great Britain has
decided to take the action stated it would
create resentment In the Senate and
among the people and distrust of the
moves of that Government. He hoped It
P llsh ,M, result ,.. m some actl Â°n on the pend

however, was not willing to say what ar'
tlon if any. he proposed to take to bring
about such a result. â¢"*"&
One suggestion made to-night as a pos
sible counter-proposal by Great Britain
was that in return for concessions made

The wholesale grocers and the retailers
alike are protesting. Those who are
directly affected by the raisÂ« in price In
cludo restaurant keepers, butchers, candy
makers. Ice cream makers, metal smelters
and fish mongers. In a notice that the
Federal Salt Company has sent out. In
cluding a schedule of the latest and high
est rates, the statement that rates are
subject to change without notice
is supposed by the dealers to mean that
future advances are contemplated. The
great bulk of the salt used is the com
mon rock, In which the advance has
amounted to between five dollars and six
dollars a ton in a few months.
According to the dealers It costs prac
tically, no more to produce salt now than
it dm a year ago. There has been no
improvement in the quality. The only
changes have been in the matter of the
price since the . combination became ef
fective.
The salt trust has again advanced
prices, which is the third jump since the
formation of the combine, a little over
two months ago. Common rock salt,
which was sold last year by the manu
facturers at $3 per ton, is now bringing
$S 73 to $9 per ton. Common dairy table
salt has been advanced from $1 per
package to 52 50 In carload lota, and the
retail grocer who does not wish to be en
cumbered with large quantities of this
kind of stock pays even more than the
rate mentioned. There is general grumb
ling over the sharp advances and the
opinion may be heard on 'change that the
evident purpose of the salt trust Is to
make a stake before opposition can ma
terialize.

OLD MAN IS MURDERED.
After Fighting for His Wealth, Is
Stabbed to Death.
HONOLULU, Jan. 30.â A South Sea Isl
ander, known as Kukuma, was brutally
murdered by a supposed robber In the
Kalhlh district last Friday night. He was
an old man employed as a watchman in
Judge Wilcox's pol factory. At some time
during the night he was attacked by a
man with a knife. Unarmed and alone,
he defended himself for a long time and
at last fell helpless with a dozen cuts in
his arms, head and chest. The robber
searched his room and left the old man,
who was .found later and taken to the
hospital, where he died without giving
any information about 'ihcTaff air.
The old man slept in' a small room,
where he was known to be keeping the
small funds he saved. He wore a bag
round his neck In which he kept some sil
ver and it is thought that he had a little
hoard somewhere in the room. .Blood was
scattered all about for a distance of fifty
feet when the old man was found, show
ing that he had fought long to defend his
money. Â¦ The slashes of the knlfo in his
assailant's hand had cut one thumb clean
off and had terribly mutilated both hands
and arms, besides making a dangerous
gash in Kukuma's head.
The police have no clew to the murderer.
The victim did not talk English nor Ha
.wailan and he died before a South Sea
Island interpreter could be secured. To E.
Montgomery, a man who was among
those who gave assistance, he tried to In
dicate by signs that the robber was a
Japanese.
The telephone service, which has come
in for very severe criticisms lately, is
blamed for the fatal termination of the
fight. Central couid not be awakened by
Montgomery" and he had to go In person
for the hospital wagon to take the In
jured man. (The delay cost Kukuma so
much blood that he never revived.

SANTA ANA, Feb. fc.â Rain has fllen
here all day and prospects are for a fur
ther downpour to-night. The big San
Joaquin ranch has lost already many hun
dred acres of grain* from washouts and
fear is' felt that much more damage will
be done if rain continues. There is moro
snow in the mountains than has been
in ten years and in Santa Ana can
yon, eighty miles northeast of here, twen
ty-one and a half inches of rain has
already fallen this season, and it is fall
ing to-day In torrents. Bear Valley dam
has forty-five feet of water and is rapidly
filling up. The total rainfall for this lo
cality is over eleven inches so far, and
lowland farmers and celery growers aro
sure to suffer loss.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8.â The Street Su
perintendent's office was deluged again
to-day by complaints of anxious citizens
against washouts here and menacing
ponds there. After Investigation no dan
ger threatening- to life or property was
discovered, the only case requiring extra
ordinary attention being the reservoir at
Sixth and Burlington streets. This pond
has increased In volume since the No
vember storm, and concern is felt more
for the possible results of further storms
than the menace of the present conditions.
The rains to-day set the street streams
running again, and washouts already
formed, were made deeper. The attention
of the Street Department was centered
upon the big storm lake on Sixth street,
near Burlington. The pond is now several
hundred feet wideÂ» and as the storm water
has continued to flow into it it has backed
up into the two approaching ravines In
seeking its level. It is here that the
greatest complaint has arisen, for the res
idents fear that if the water continues to
gather it will back into their yards and
destroy the foundations of their houses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA. Feb. 8.â The freight train
from Santa Barbara was wrecked at 11:15
o'clock this morning about one mile west
of the Ventura River bridge. Four cars
were practically demolished while four
others were badly smashed. All were
thrown together in a heap. The former
were outfitters' cars, dining-car, bunk
house-car and supply and material' cars.
The bunk car, occupied by ten men, was
thrown across the track at right angles
and laid on its side.
Lonnie King's right hand was caught
in the door and nine companions were
thrown on top of liim. It was necessary
to cut the door away with an ax to allow
King to escape. L. O. Jacques was hurt
about the back and taken to a hospital.
He soon recovered.
One car jumped the track completely
and was thrown five feet. A stove set
lire to It, but the lire was soon extin
guished. The trucks were torn from
seven cars.
The accident was caused by the heavy
rain. The storm waters from the moun
tains filled the flume with dirt and un
dermined the roadbed.
The freight engino and two cars went
over without any trouble. The third flat
car dropped and lost its front wheels.
Each succeeding car lost its trucks and
Jumped the track. Nothing was done to
clear the track until 7 o'clock, when a
wrecking train arrived from Los Angeles.
Division Superintendent Burckhalter-ac
companied the wrecking crew. Forty
tourists and other passengers bound for
Santa Barbara are at local hotels. A
cattle train with 1000 head is stopped here
as is also the evening passenger train.
The OJal passenger train is delayed. The
Los Angeles freight was ordered to stay
In Santa Paula.
Early this morning the large main pipe
lhÂ«e of the Santa Ana Water Company
burst at Foster Barranca, three miles up
the Ventura River, Twenty feet of pipe
was lost. This was also caused by the
heavy rains. The city was without water
to-day and there la none, to-night. The
line will probably, be repaired by to-mor
row morning. It has been raining since
4 o'clock this morning. The rainfall ex
ceeds one inch at 7 o'clock and over three
inches for the past few days. Ojai Valley
has over twenty inches.

JAPANESE CONSUL
K. UYENO ARRIVES
In h!F address last night at Temple
Emanu-El Rabbi Voorsanger chose for his
subject th<5 memory of the late Chief Jus
tice John Marshall. In plain, vigorous
language he told his audience how the
youth of Marshall was spent, and in com
menting on the later life of the distln
jruished jurist he boeame most eloquent.
"John Marshall," said the rabbi, "was
made of rare stuff. At the age of 32 years
his education consisted of only such
knowledge as his father, a plain farmer,
could impart. Then lor two years he had
thÂ» benefit of private tutelage, and upon
this foundation was built the educational
structure which gavt? him his reputation
as a jurist of widespread knowledge and
Â¦ man of Intpgrity.
"'We have not the faintest conception of
what was going on when Marshall was a
youth. We may have a knowledge of the
h!sÂ«tory of the times, but we have no con
ception of the difficulties that men of his
culture were obUpwl to overcome. Bril
liancy Â°f intellect then might assert itself,
but -without the educational advantages of
10-da?. Overcoming all obstacles. Mar-
Khali made for hlmsrif the name of. a
grand, j^ohle and good man."
Rabbi Nieto of ConfcTeeration Sherith Is
rael in Wp lecture last night discussed the
rale of "The Wandor'ms Jew." "Eugene
Sue." he said, "cou!<5 not have, had hÂ«
been Jew instead of CJhristian. formulated
a prayer more full of true worth than the
jrrayer uttered by his remarkable charac
ter. "We do not want mere toleration or
an acknowledgment that the Jew has
been *"ise. Nor are "we seeking grandeur
or greatness. "VYh.it we do want is the
spiritual or material -worth due those who
have accompliFhed the things for which
they havo striven."

WORDS OF EULOGY
FROM VOORSANGER
CLAIMS GODFREY TREATS
HIS FAMILY BRUTALLY
Officer McMurray Secures Warrant
for Arrest of Employe of Har
bor Commissioners.
A warrant was sworn out in the Police
Cotirt yesterday for "the arrest of George
T. Godfrey, who lives at 1337 Vermont
street, for neglecting to care for his four
minor children. Ofilcer McMurray of the
California Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children Is searching for God
frey and he will probably be taken into
custody to-day.
Godfrey is employed by the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners. He Is alleged
to have beaten his wife on numerous oc
casions and otherwise treated her cruelly.
At present she is in a delicate condition
and his treatment of her has caused her
mental anguish and pain. A week ago he
became incensed at her and severely beat
her. His wife's brother, hearing of his
alleged cruel treatment of her, called on
Godfrey and flogged him unmercifully.
Godfrey, being unable to secure satisfac
tion from his brother-in-law, took re
venge, it is averred, upon his helpless
wife and children. He packed his belong
ings in a trjink and took up residence ;r.
the Grand Southern Hotel, corner of Mis
sion and Seventh streets. He next Visited
the office of a newspaper and inserted an
advertisement to the effect that he would
not be responsible for any debts contract
ed by his better half. This worked a
hardship on Mrs. Godfrey and her little
ones. The butcher and the baker and
orhÂ«r storekeepers read the advertisement
and, she says, refused to trust her for the
necessities of life. Mrs. Godfrey's moth-*?
and kind hearted neighbors relieved her
unhappy plight by giving her food.
Rent day fell due yesterday and the
landlord notified her that if maney was
not forthcoming he would turn the family
out. This threat had its effect on Mrs.
Godfrey. She called upon Secretary White
of the Humane Society and the latter took
immediate action. He called upon the
Harbor Commissioners and explained the
situation to them and they promised to
take action at once. No attention was
paid to the appeal, however, and the Chil
dren's Society took a different course.
They had a warrant sworn out for the
arrest of Godfrey and expect to force him
to take care of his children, no matter
what differences there may bo between
himself and wife.
Lee Fook. the Chinese who. it is alleged
shot Hon Yick at the corner of "Washing
ton street and Fish alley about half past
10 o'clock Thursday night, was arrested
early yesterday morning by Detective
Hamill and locked up in "the tanks'* at
the City Prison. He was Identified at the
Receiving Hospital by Hon Yick a few
hours before his death, which occurred
shortly after 10 o'clock last night, as the
man who shot him.
Detective Hamill accompanied Warrant
Clerk Burke to the hospital In the aft
ernoon to take Hon Yick's ante
mortem statement. Hon Yick de
clared that when he heard the report
of the shot he looked over his shouldsr
and recognized Lee Fook, who had a re
volver In his hand. Lee Fook shot him,
he said, because about a year ago there
was trouble between them about money.
Lee Fook threatened to kill him then ar.d
had repeated the threat several times
since. He knew that was the cause of th.j
shooting, he concluded.
When Hamill returned to the Hall of
Justice with Warrant Clerk Burke he
went to Lieutenant Blrdsall and asked for
men to surround the building on the cor
ner of Washington street and Fish alley,
saying he would make another search for
I-ee Kook. He got the men. but when ha
tried to g-ain an entrance to the building
ho was unsuccessful. lie had to break
open the door and after making his way
to the top floor he had to ring: a bell sev
eral times before James Downey, a
watchman, made his appearance. Downey
told him that Lee Fook was in the room
ai.d Hamill arrested him. Lee Fook de
nied shooting Hon Yick or knowing him,
and said he had not been out of his room
for two days.
Jlamill hurried Lee Fook to the hospi
tal and Hon Yick referred to him by
name and positively Identified him as thÂ«j
man who shot him. A thorough search
of Lee Fook's room was made, but no re
volver could be found.
The doctors at the hospital say that per
itonitis was caused by the bullet wound
that ended lion Yick's life.

So far no action has been taken by the
Government In regard to the letter. It
was hinted to-day that somebody would

that event the Government would feel
compelled to do something.
Mr. Wu's statements that General Otis
"committed an egregious error" In pro
hibiting the Immigration of Chinese into
the Philippines and that "General Otis
acted upon the 111 advice of some one,"
are resented by high officials, one of
whom declared that Mr. Wu had made
a "bad break, the repetition of which

LEGALLY INSANE BUT
ACTUALLY IN BIGHT MIND
As indicative of the general acknowl
edgment of the crisis In the metal trades.
Consul Fleming quotes from Edinburgh
papers, which state that "the iron and
steel trades have gone, from us": "the.
outlook Is appalling": "the question of
foreign competition In the metal trades is
the problpm before the country in the new
century," rind other expressions of alarm
at the outlook.
The press In general, says Mr. Fleming,
blames the manufacturers for not adopt
ing labor-saving machinery in all branches
of production where lt>can be introduced,
and also blames the workmen for their
undisguised ' hostility to all labor-saving
As to the lack of practical Instruction In
the industrial arts, the Consul states:
"It is the accepted opinion here that In
the matter of technical education Great
Britain is far behind the United States
and Germany." . â¢_
On this subject also the Consul trans
mits newspaper articles eulogizing the lib
erality of rich American citizens in the
founding and endowment of institutions
for the acquirement of such an education,
and declaring that this generosity on the
part of wealthy Americans is a potent fac
tor fn the educational development of the
United States. .
Consul Fleming concludes his report
with a comprehensive review of the fuel
question. The British manufacturer, he
says, may not give due weight to- the
technical advice and notes of warning
which come from his "able Instructors'
in the public press, but he cannot shut
his eyes to the meaning of $3 50 coal. Mr.
Fleming points out that all coal deposits
In Great Britain arÂ» known and that there
are few fields that have not been worked
for a long time. Nearly one-fourth of the
output last year was exported. . and the
opinion begins to prevail that this amount
Is entirely too great to send away, in. view
of the limit which production apparently
haÂ« reached. . ,
WASHINGTON, Feb. S.-A report re
ceived at the State Department from
United States Consul Fleming at Edin
burgh, Scotland,' sets forth an alarming
decline In the metat industry of Great
Britain, calls attention to the lamenta
ble lack of thorough technical education
among British, engineers and discusses the
mooted question as to whether or not the
heavy exportation of coal from Great
Britain should continue.
"To describe the difference In the con
dition of the metal trades at the beginning
and at the end of last year," says the
Consul, "would be to contrast enormous
activity and practical stagnation."
The depression Is attributed in part to
a fall in the prices of metals all along
the line, but chiefly to offers of American
iron and steel at reduced prices, which,
the Consul states, came upon the market
last autumn with crushing effect. What
made the difficulty worse for British pro
ducers, he continues, was that Germany,
having bought largely from America in
the spring and summer, became alarmed
and resold in England at reduced figures,
also placing iron and steel on the market

that William A. Morris of Stan
ford University was entitled to wear the
medal for individual excellence in oratory.
The question discussed was: "Resolved,
That the French administrative law is in
compatible with the spirit of a democratic
government." President David Starr Jor
dan was the presiding officer and Hon.
G. H. Cabaniss, C. P. Pomeroy and Wil
liam Thomas were the judges. Stanford
University was represented by W. A.
Morris. C. M. Marrack and J. F. English,
while J. H. Steinhart, W. B. Greeley and
L*. E. Martin spoke for the University of
California.
J. H. Steinhart of the University of Cal
ifornia was the flr^t speaker. He main
tained that the French system was not
designed to develop the individual in that
it failed to supply him with the education
necessary for self-government. In France
there is not a single power operated in
favor of the people. Every officer is de
pendent upon a partisan administration
for advancement or perpetuity. The ad
ministration once in power becomes a
sovereignty in itself.
J. F. English of Stanford led for the
1 negative. France needed strong admin
istrative powers in her Government, he
said, because she is surrounded by ene
mies and must often act quickly. But
private rights were not sacrificed thereby,
for the administrative- courts are more
favorable to private rights than ordinary
courts. The people have supreme power
in the last analysis, private rights being
guaranteed.
W. B. Greeley followed for the affirma
tive. He contended that French admin
istrative law cripples the Judiciary and
checks individual liberty. The great but
tresses of English liberty -have not been
built by Parliaments, but by the peopla
themselves. A weak judiciary allows the
administrate system to ride rough shod
over private rights. It crushes out con
stitutional guarantees and our own Anglo-
Saxon wr't of habeas corpus had no place
under French law. The speaker repre-

It took tha three Judges of the
Carnot intercollegiate debate just
two minute* to-night to decide
Special Dispatch to The CalL
sented the University of California.
C M. Marrack of Stanford was second
for the negative. He argued that all ad
ministrative law takes from . the people
some of their liberty, but that the French i
system does not take from them the ulti
mate power, for at the ballot box the
people are the last power, as they elect
the Chamber of Deputies, which is su
preme.
W. A. Morris of Stanford for the affirm
ative contended that where a power over
rode the rights, and liberties of the peo
ple it was not compatible with true dem
ocracy. The Ministry ruling' France be
comes Its own judge as to its preroga
tives. For political reasons free speech
and free press can be overturned with
out recourse.
L. E. Martin of California closed for
the negative, arguing that even though
the French system gave gTeat powers to
officials, it was still for the beet inter
ests of the people. Under it the fran
chise was universal.
Steinhart in rebuttal said that the test
of a democratic system was the question
of ultimate authority. This could be
found as much in the Roman empire
under Caesar as in France to-day.
J. F. English insisted that the admin
istrative system protected the rights of
the citizen. The fact that the people had
never overthrown the Assembly proved
that there never had been cause for It.
W. B. Greeley said that the spirit of
French government was not democratic,
even if it appeared so. When a storm
was brewing: their liberties vanished.
C. M. Marrack said that the system
which the negative defended had a coun
terpart In every country, even in free
America.
W. A. Morris objected that because the
French system was labeled democratic it
did not prove it, for it had only existed
thirty years.
L. E. Martin closed the debate, hold-
Jng the French system should not be
Judged by the Anglo-Saxon ideas. The
system promoted peace and order and had
every chance to obtain Justice in either
of the two courts.
When the decision of the judges was
announced the students from the cardinal
section of the audience rushed upon the'
sta#e and ' bore their victor away in
triumph.
Hale of Maine said he could understand
perfectly the views of those opposed to
the measure, but he believed the Senate
would be Indulgent, as it always had
been, with Senators who desire to prepare
speeches upon the. measure. He suggested
that the Senate bear in mind that tha
pending measure was in effect a political
measure, and that the majority would
have to assume the responsibility for It.
He did not believe there was any desire
to rillbuster against the bill. .
TUlman of South Carolina expressed his
admiration for the "wisdom and diplo
macy always exhibited by the Senator
from Maine" (Hale), and for the "placid
way in which lie had attempted to smooth
troubled waters here." .He inquired, how
ever, how the Senators could prepare
speeches when they were now under full
head of-steam from 7 o'clock In the morn
ing until 11 o'clock at night.
Hale believed that those who desired to
prepare speeches would find time to do so.
The shipping bill, without objection, was
laid aside temporarily in order that the
naval appropriation bill might be con
sidered. An amendment was agreed to
providing that the promotion of officers
of the navy and marine corps, made on
account of war services, shall not inter
fere with the regular promotion of offi
cers.
An amendment involving the length of
the course of study at the naval academy
brought on a long discussion. The Sen
ate committee had stricken out the House
provision that the naval -cadets who had
completed their four regular courses at
the academy should be commissioned a3
naval officers at once. Hale explained
that by the House provision 142 officers
would be "dumped" into the navy at one
time at the foot of the list, thus creating
what was known technically as a "hump"
in the list. This "hump" would stop the
promotion of the younger officers. It was
not expected, Hale said, that officers
should be provided immediately for all the
war vessels authorized. If such a plan
were followed it wouia cost $100,000,000 a
year for'the navy.
Chandler, a former Secretary of the
Navy, said that no greater mistake could
be made than to reduce the cadet course
fromsix years to four years, as the House
had done. Without action the Senate,
after a brief executive session, at 6 p. m.
adjourned. \
Soon after the Senate convened a reso
lution previously offered by Pettigrew
calling on the Secretary of War for a copy
of General MacArthur's report as to the
conditions in the Philippines and for other
papers relating to the Philippines was
adopted.
At the instance of Frye of Maine con
sideration of the shipping bill was thÂ»n
resumed, and Frye made an appeal to
the Senate that a time be fixed for the
vote upon the pending measure. He said
he was exceedingly desirous for a vote.
Personally he had no more desire for
night sessions than any other Senator.
He hoped that ths Senate might agree
upon some time for a vote â a time far
enough off to perm'.t the necessary lat
itude for proper debate.
Jones of Arkansas said he did not think
that at this time any agreement could be
made for a vote.
Pritchard (Rep.) of North Carolina
spoke to-day in support of the shipping
bill and then the naval appropriation bill
was considered the rest of the day, the
shipping bill being laid aside informally.
WASHINGTON,' Feb. 8.-An ineffectual
effort was made ! in the Senate to-day to

SUBSIDY BILL
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.â To-day's
Cabinet meeting was of much importance.
The discussion bore not only upon the
Cuban question, but also upon the steps
necessary to be taken by Congress fos the
future government of the Philippines.
Senator Spooner, just before the Senate
adjourned this evening, introduced his
Philippine bill as an amendment to the
army appropriation bill and added this
proviso: â¢ â¢
"That all franchises granted under au
thority here shall contain a reservation
of the right "to alter, amend or appeal the
same."
In its present form Spooner s bill pro
vides that when the insurrection is sup
pressed in the Philippines, all military,
civil and judicial power necessary to gov
ern the islands shall, until otherwise pro
vided by Congress, be vested in Such per
son and persons and exercised in such
manner as the President shall direct for
maintaining and protecting the inhabit
ants of the Islands In the tree enjoyment
of their liberty, property and religion. It
is probable that Senator Spooner will
make his bill much broader, so as to pro
tect persons who engage in large busi
ness enterprises, such as constructing
railroads, erecting factories, establishing
plantations and working: mines by modern
machinery.
Senator Platt, chairman of the Commit
tee on Relations with Cuba, with the as
sistance of Mr. Spooner, is drafting a
Joint resolution which will state clearly
the position which Congress thinks the
President should assume in determining
the relations between the United States
and Cuba.
The Cabinet talked to-day about the
probability of any resolution being drafted
which would fit the solution. Until the
Cuban constitution is completed no one
will- know what its shortcomings are in
an American sense. The resolution which
Congress designs for the guidance of the
President may go too far, or it may not
go far enough. As a member of the Cab
inet phrased it, "It is like cutting a coat
for a man without taking his measure."
If Congress can meet the Philippine sit
uation at this session and pass a resolu
tion stating the exact attitude of this
country toward Cuba, the President will
not insist upon an extra session. He told
the members of the Cabinet to-day that
it looked less like an extra session than
at any time for two weeks. This is due
to the disposition on the part of the Sen
ators to co-operate with the President in
meeting this important question.

Robinson made a brief closing argument
in behalf of Wilcox, severely â¢criticizing
those who had betrayed the confidence of
tirivate letters and had made them th<s
basis of these charges. A brief on the law
points will be submitted next Tuesday. â¢
During the argument Mann interjected
the statement that certain letters written
by eminent public men came quite as
near treason as those of Wilcox referring
to the Filipinos.
That under thÂ« laws ef the United States,
at a fair and free election, he was elected
Delcpate from Hawaii and no reason exists or
has existed disqualifying him.
The additional letters written by Wilcox
were submitted and he made the same
answer to them. These letters were writ
ten In 18I* and criticized the America :i
course in the Philippines.
Attorney Gear, the prosecutor, then con
tended that the election of Wilcox was
Irregular and void, as the requirements of
the United States statutes were not com
plied with. On being cross-questioned
Oear paid he had made speeches in Hawaii
favoring: the election as Delegate of Park
er, the opponent of Wilcox, and in the hi
tpeoches he had not questioned the right
O( Hawaii to have a I>elegate. Gear stat
ed tha* in Wilcox's campaign speeches he
he bad said he would restore Queen LJIlu
< kaiar.i. When the witness said Wilcox
had "eternally damned the Americans."
the Delegate muttered "lie," but was re
strained by his counsel. After Gear had
presented his evidence he made an ex
tended argument arraigning the Delegate.
He admits that on January 31, 1839, and on
March 8, 1S9S, he wrote letters appearing in
the petition; that said letters were of a per
sonal and confidential nature and sent to oiie
whom he eui'iKced vti a friend, and who.
be thought, would not betray his confidence.
He further says that said letters were writ
ten by him ur.der an entire misconception of
the real attitude of the Government of the
L'eited States toward the people of Hawaii.
That h* <\Yilcox) is a native Hawaiian; that
he Fhared with tlie nati\c |*-opk- in their loy
â¢ ltjr to t!ie former *Ju<-en I^tliuokalani during
h*r rÂ»-ign and was not in sympathy with tht
relening power immediately succeeding h*r
reign.
That after the annexation of Hawaii he did
not understand fully the institutions or the
tiflinsf- of the Vr.lte.1 Stales, liut all dSubts
were dis-prlU-d when the Tonpress Rave to the
l^oj.le of Hawaii a. system of or-

That, in coir.rann with the people, he at all
times, with genuine patriotism, supported the
Urifd States atvi its institutions and is now
and has been a loys.1 FujjjiGrt^r of the consti
tution, laws ajid government of the United
States.
At the afternoon portion Representative
Robinson presented the following specific
answer of Wilcox to the charges con
tained In th<> letters submitted:
Ueorjre D. Gear, who makes the charge,
was asked to produce the originals of the
letters, and. until these could be secured,
the committee went into executive session
to determine a course of action.
Robinson added that the Delegate had
received no notice of contest, as provided
by the rules. He asked. 'under the ctrcum
ptanes, that ten days be allowed for prep
aration on the merits if the committee
proposed to conduct a formal contest.
f reused of having written, dated respec
tively January 31, 1Â£O, and March 8, 1899,
lie tugrg-ests that the conditions prevailing
ut that time and the legal status of the
Hawaiian Islands with respect to the
United States were entirely different from
those existing later and at the time of h : 3
election. He claims to be now sincerely
and thoroughly an American, believing im
tind heartily supporting the constitution.
The written answer of Wilcox was sub

KING'S MESSAGE
TO THE HOUSE
Appreciates Courtesy Shown
j Upon Recent Death of
the Queen.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8.â This was prob
ably the last day to be devoted to private
pension legislation by the House of Rep
resentatives In this Congress. High-water
mark, made in the Fifty-first Congress,
was almost reached to-day when 1S4 bills
were passed, against 197 passed at a single
session in the former Congress. In all,
tne House at this Congress has passed
about 900 bills, a number considerably ex
ceeded in the Fifty-first.
The Speaker laid before the House the
following letter from Acting Secretary of
State Hill:
"I have the honor to inform you of the
receipt of a telegTam vesterday from the
Embassador to Great Britain, reporting
that hia Majesty's Minister for Foreign
Affairs laid before the King the resolution
adopted by the House of Representatives
relating to the death of Queen Victoria
and that by the King's command Lord
Lansdowne expresses the royal apprecia
tion of that mark of respect and also of
the additional respect shown bv the House
to the memory of the late Queen by Ita
immediate adjournment."
The House adjourned at 5:40 p. m.
President of. th.e Chamber.
VIENNA, Feb. .8.â The Chamber of
Deputies to-day elected Count Vetter von
der IJlie to be president of the House.
COMMITTEE ASKS
FOR CONFERENCE
House May Meet With Sen
ate to Discuss Revmue ,
Reduction Bill.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8.â The special
meeting' of the Ways and Means Commit
tee to-day for the purpose of acting: on
the revenue reduction bill resulted In
something of a surprise by the adoption
of a. resolution, submitted by the minor
ity through Representative Richardson of
Tennessee for a disagreement to the Sen
ate amendments in bulk and requesting
a conference Â¦with the Senate. This 'was
an amendment to the majority resolu
tion, which did not provide for a confer
ence with the Senate.
Following the meeting' of the committee
the Republican members held a. confer
ence*whlch did not, however, bring about
any change of plans. It was stated after,
ward, ad explaining the votes of some of
the Republican members, that during the
conference yesterday the Republicans
were evenly divided on the (raestlon of a
conference. Considerable feeling: was
displayed over to-day's results. On the
other hand, the Democratic members of
the committee were highly elated at the
outcome. Some of the Republican mem
bers of the committee openly expressed
the opinion that the action taken meant
the ultimate acceptance of the bill as thÂ«
Senate had changed it. increasing the re
duction from about J3O,00O,0OO to approxi
mately J4O.000.00O.

That was the experience of Mr. Hood,

tTi-o cups of strong coffee for dinner and
hud to He on the bed four hours before
he could move. Since that time no coffee
is used, but Postum altogether. He has
entirely recovered his health, has no more
trouble nrlth his heart, and says he likes
Postum better than .he ever did like the
old fashioned coffee.
"A number of our neighbors use Postum
altogether to the exclusion of ordinary
enfff-e. Once in a while I find a person
who has trkd Postum and does not like
it. liut aJways find, upon Inquiry, that

There is one and only one specific known to medicine for diseases arising
from impure blood and a debilitated nervous system, and that is Paine's celery
compound.
It is the most remarkable remedy that the scientific research of this

It is not a patent medicine. It is not foisted upon public attention by
smart advertisement writers. Its proprietors claim nothing for it that it will
not accomplish. It appeals to no prejudices, but relies absolutely upon its un-
paralleled record for preventing and curing the diseases for which the greatest
physician of modern times intended it.
No remedy ever accomplished so much good; none ever achieved such

characteristic of a long bull movement that

"Generally speaking: market conditions hav*
changed but little during the past month, but
such as have taken place went against thÂ»
article. Trade has been quiet, but this is
pertly due to light receipts of new crop, and
the undesirable character of last crop' coffees
now remaining In first hands. Stocks in deal
ers hands are small and we anticipate a bet
ter demand when the usual assortment of all
grades Is obtainable.
"The only notable change has been In ths
price of unwashed Salvador, which broke
sharply from S*ic to S'ic closing steady, and
with all offerings taken.
"Prices for Brazils In Sew York since Jan
nary 7 show a net loss of He for Rio No. 7

lower grade and a superabundance of the lat

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been four arrivals of coal froa
British Columbia, 9032 tons; five from Wash
ington. 13,970 tons; one from Oregon, 840 tons:
one from Baltimore. 220S tons; total, 23.850
tons. The deliveries this week are generous,
and fully ample for all immediate require
ments. Business generally is active, sales arÂ»
large and priced well maintained. The Incle
ment weather the past week has materially in
creased the sales of domestic grades, and thÂ«
demand for itum fuel has been 'Â¦ large, prin
cipally for merchant steamers and transports.
The stocks In yard have- not been added to,
hence .but little reserve coal Is on hand, com
petition for sales Is not sharp and price* arÂ«
wetl sustained. Foreign is not cutting any
figure whatever, as its high Import cost shuts
It out almost entirely. The cost and freight
on Swansea anthracite have be"en relaxed some
what, so that several cargoes have been sold
this month for future loading. Australian la
almost excluded entirely as the high cost for
same at Newcastle prohibits ita shipment; tha
freight rates have diminished a little, still It
costs considerably more to land here than our
coast product, with which It has to compete.
The consumption of fuel oil Is growing grad
ually, and must necessarily Interfere with
coal later on as a steam producer. Contracts
for future delivery of oil are being made at
reduced figures."

was limited to-day tha torn? of the general list
was steady. were exceptions. Their
movements were very erratic. Prices at the
Opening were depressed and In the first hour
there was free selling all around. Then the
market found its feet, and Union and Southern
Pacific Issues were bll up sharply, steadying
tHe list. New York prices as they came in on
the cable caused a violent see-saw toward the
end and the close was irregular. Southern Pa
cific? b;Ing strong. Union Pacifies flat, the
Denver . Issues buoyant and the . rest of the
market sacglng. Grand Trunk dropped heavily
on the disappointing dividend news. TIntos
spurted on the expectation of the declaration
of a dividend of 50s in April. Anacondas were
affected sympathetically. Money was a little
bit stiffer, call loans 3 to 3>,j per cent; time
money, 3Vi per cent. Tl>e'new war loan, which
was expected to-day, was announced after the
closr- of business. The Government aeks for

business or the prices of their products as yet
and will probably have no material Influence
In the future. Quotations will depend on the
relation of supply to demand, which at preeent
gives an undertone of great strength. This is
most evident in billets, which cannot be se
cured at the pool price. While former quota
tions are nominally In force. It would require
a material advance to secure contracts. Struc
tural forms are also In notably brisk demand,
and it is impossible to secure prompt delivery
of any finished steel at Pittsburg. Chicago
makers also have orders far ahead, and at all
leading points the placing of new business Is
limited to small contracts.
Prices of staple products show but moder
ate decline and quotations - of "manufactured
goods are steady in all directions. Pressure
to eell is everywhere conspicuously absent.
Jobbers report good demand for spring goods,
particularly for the Western trade, and tha
only complaint still comes from the woolen
goods market in the East, which has not yet
felt the expected stimulus. In this line, how
ever, prices do not decline, and agents expect
better conditions.
More seasonable weather in the East has
brought up the volume of business In retail
lines a little this' week and at tho W r est and
South distribution of- merchandise Is on a sat
isfactory scale.
NEW YORK, Feb. 8.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Dun's Rcviezv of Trade.
From July 1 to date, this season, wheat ex
l>orts are 120 975 496 bufshels. against 123.024.232
last season and 156.598,159 in 1898-99.
Business failures for the week In the Ignited
States- number 245. against 238 last week. 281

189S and 301 in 1S97. t '
Canadian failures for the week number 31
as against 27 last week, 25 in this week a year
ago, 33 in 1899 61 In 1S9S and C4 In 1SD7.
tttter advices from the distributive trade may,
however, help the situation. Demand for wool
is only to cover manufacturers' sales and some
soft spots are reported.. Plain dress woolens
are In chief demand and. men's wear goods
ere . slow of sale - . \
Iron and steel have been rather quiet but
steady and even strong as to price, with fin
ished products, particularly structural mater
ial.- m active inquiry. > Immediate delivery of
steel billets can only be obtained at advances
of 50c to $1 over the pool price. Bessemer pig
iron is stronger, 23@50c higher on the week.
Sales of foundry pigiron to pipe manufacturers
arÂ»\ liberal at Chicago and St. Louis. Stocks
are claimed to be not accumulating at tur
naces in the former districts. Birmingham re
ports the -coal supply Inadequate to demands
of iron furnaces which are reported sold two
months ahead. " .
Wheat, including' flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,997.481 bushels, against 3...6.
100 last week, 2 902.357 in the corresponding
â¢week of 1S00, 5 780,500 In 1899 and 3,419,504 in

The Robbers Secure No Coin â Two Suspects Arrested
ALAMEDA, Feb. 6.â Two fodtpads
armed with shotguns held up four
men on High street, near the
tidal canal bridgre. in broad day
light yesterday. Perry Whalen
cad P. J. Matthews, formerly deputy con
stables cf Brooklyn Township, are now
under azxest. charjtcd with tho crime.
The victims of the robbery were Julius
Pettijohn and Manuel Miller, residents of
FruitvaJc. and twa n-.cn from Alameda,
whose naxacs could not be learned. They
cpont yesterday hunting en the Bay
Farm Island marshes. As they ap
proached the HiRh-strcet canal bridge on
their way home about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon they saw two men row a boat
ashore aad get cut. They paid but little
attentign to them, until suddenly from
behind them they heard the command,
â¢'Threw up your hands."
The quartet of hunters turned around
to see the muzzles of two guns pointed
directly at them and within a few lncnes
of their heads. They at once recognized
the men whom they had seen In the boat
and up went their hands in obedience to
the command.
Then one of the robbers proceeded to
go through the hunters' pockets, while
his companion kept them covered and
threatened to blow tfcelr heads off If
they dared to move.
Not a cent of money was secured by
the robbers. A quarter of a dollar in a
Email pocket In Pettijohn's clothing was
overlooked. But the men did not go
Â«*iy empty-handed, for they f>ok the

CLASH IN POLICE
BENEFIT SOCIETY
Patrolmen Make Objection to
Payment of Death
: Assessment.
Members Ireads to a Move for
Adoption of New
Threatened Withdrawal of Eight
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 8.
The threatened withdrawal of eight
members of the Policemen's Mutual Bene
fit Association has caused a serious crisis
in the affairs of the organization, which
has been in existence many years. Its pur
pose has been to provide a relief fund in
cases of death of members while in active
service. The by-laws have provided for
a per capita assessment of $20 upon each
member In the event of a death. This
would realize about $1200 to the family of
the deceased policeman.
Sergeants Clark and Green and Patrol
men Murcell. McCloud, Flynn and Mc-
Sorley and Detective Kyte are the eight
members who opposed the present plan.
They expressed their objections to-day at
a special meeting of the association at
which even* member of the department,
including Chief Hodgkins. the president,
was present. The objections to the pres
ent system were presented by the officers
who proposed to withdraw, and the entire
subject was canvassed and ciscusaed at
much length.
Many of the men thought that the bur
den would prove very severe upon them,
because of the advancing years of not a
few of their brother policemen. They
suggested that a graded system of death
benefits be adopted, or what might be bet
ter that a fixed monthly assessment plan
be inaugurated.
Those who favor the abolishing of tho
present flat death assessment scheme Â¦won
the day, in that the members decided that
a new plan shall be devised by which the
objections Fhall be overcome. Upon mo
tion. Chief Hodgkins appointed a commit
tee of five to prepare new by-laws. The
committee named is as follows: Former
Chief of Police W. F. Fletcher, retired;
Captain "W. J. Petersen, S. H. Mltcheil.
J. P. Scanlan and William Quigley.
The officers of the association are:
President, Chief St. Clair Hodgkins: vice
president. Captain A. Wilson: treasurer,
A. Shorey; secretary, Leo Anurewa.

"Let Kt> that line." shouted Honn."
"No spika EngUs'," replied thÂ© Italian*
Acain did Hogan cry out and apaln cam

Then the exasperated mate went inte

"Swish! swish!! swish!!!"
Down went Hogan under a fire of her*
rln^s that causrht him from all sides.
Back In their boats the fishermen'!
forces were deluging the ax-wleldlng
sailor with all sorts and conditions of her

glistened with the scaly product of thÂ«

opportunity presented, thus savins the
time which would be consume l in sailing
by the more or less uncertain Â¦winds. The
plan has proven so convenient to the
swarthy sons of the Mediterranean that
they strenuously objected a few days a*o
when the steamboat men about the harbor
decided to put a stop to the practice.
The first move against the fishermen
was made by Captain Frederickson of th*
Newark a few days ago. As he entered
the pilot house to start for San Francisco
the skipper observed a fleet of fishing
boats waiting to "hook on."
"See here, Hogan." announced the mas
ter, summoning his trusty mate, "if those
Italians try to tow out to-day, cast 'em
adrift. This steamer isn't in that busi
ness."
"Aye. aye. sir," cheerily responded Ho
gan. And he took station astern to await
developments. They came fast enough.

As the object of the labor unions In
wS^ 1 "^ the Â° Ialm of Contractor
Â¦VVorthington on the city treasury was
merely to test the validity of the law
limiting a day's labor on public work to
oight hours they will not carry t nelr
fight against the contractor before the
Supreme Court.
rL ?u M^! rOy Â° f C0Un?el for unions
end City Attorney Dow filed a stipulation
to-day stating that they would -waive
their right of appeal and accept Judge
Hall's decision as final.
Judge Hall immediately granted the
writ of mandate sued for by Worthtne
ton, ordering: the City Treasurer to pay
the amount of his contract. The money
was paid to-day.
At the conclusion of the hearing which
resulted in Judge Hall's decision that the
eight-hour.law is invalid the unions an
nounced that they would at once take an
appeal. This determination they baÂ«ed
Â£",, th - e ,, fact ., ll l at alth oush Judge Hall
had followed the Supreme Court in his
decision the personnel of that bodv has
changed since the ruling cited by jud*e
Hall was made. It was the hope of the
union? to obtain a reversal of the former
decision.
Their attorneys, however, thought It
wiper to abandon the old law and present
a new bill for enactment at this session
?v th Â« legislature. Therefore Contractor
A\ orthlngton was notified that no further
attempt would be made to prevent his
fecurinp the money on his contract.

ALA1IEDA. Feb. *.â In the future all
the lards, butters and certain compo
sition? that bakers use in the construc
tion of bread, pies, cakes and douphnuts
â¢win be scheduled on a blackboard In the
B^ard of Health rooms monthly, so that
everj' Interested consumer thereof may
eee for himself Just what such necessaries
â¢.re ss&de of. For the safety of the gren
Â¦eral pubile the Board, of Health has de
ciied that this should be done.
Food Inspector Carpenter has been in
structed to take samples of the lard or
Its substitutes used by the bakers. After
fcbrr.lTtlr.p them to a chemical and fire
test he wiil chalk the results opposite the
name of the baker from which they were
obtaJned. on the blackboard. In thin way
It is expected to compel the bakers to
â¢top using deleterious inpredlents.
The new order of the Board of Health
is thÂ» result of an analysis of some so
called lard -which the Food Inspector cap
tured in a bakery* two weeks ago.
It turned out that it contained very
little else except bo<rf extract, the most
unwholesome Etuff. the doctors say. that
an Alamedan could eat Several other
samples were overtaken after the analy
sis of the first one had been completed
find they all showed the same symptoms.
The blackboard plan has worked well
with the dairies. Alameda was the first
to adept it. and other cities have followed
Ftilt. The milk is inspected monthly and
the lefts are posted, the result being: that
the city Is supplied with the purest milk
obtainable.

OAKLAND, Feb. 8.-Mate Hog3n

of the day among the men that
plow the deep between Oakland
and San Francisco. The first offl

encounter with a dozen Italian fishermen
after be had withstood for half an hour
a bombardment of fresh herrinss that
would have driven a less valiant fighter
down to a disgraceful defeat.
It all occurred because Mate Hogan had
learned to obey orders no nr.atter what
the result. The lads from suryiy Italy
who made his life a burden for a brief
thirty minutes were brave enough in their
way, but It was Hogan's way until he
finally forced a capitulation by a dex
trous stroke.
There are a dozen flshlnc boats which
sell their catch in Oakland. The thrifty
fishermen have been accustomed to steal

time required for the building of a canal
practically wiped out. Scott has submit
ted his ideas to President McKinley and
Secretary of War Root, and these officials
have laid the matter before the Canal
Commission. This body is now consider
ing the proposition, and Mr. Scott is pre
pared to build a working model of his
road if the Government will enter into
contract with him.
The inventor claims great things for hla
road, and its construction across the isth
mus would render a canal unnecessary.
Former inv.entors were unable to perfect
cars suitable for carrying heavy ships
around curves and up grades, but this the
San Jose inventor has done. Under his
system the largest vessel afloatâ the Oce
anic, wiih a length of 700 feetâ could be
raised from the ocean on the Atlantic side,
placed on a great car and hauled "across
the Isthmus at the rate of twenty-two
miles an hour by eight locomotives.
Scott has been at work on his railway
scheme for about four years. His plans
call for a four track railway, with an
aggregate widtn of about 80 feet. On
these run a gigantic car, so nicely bal
anced and arranged that it can traverse
any curve and grade known in modern
railway building. This car will take a
ship of 700 feet in length and round any
curve or make a complete circle in di
ameter 700 feet from inside rail to inside
rail. For the 700-foot ships a speed of
twenty-two miles an hour can .be made,
but for tugs and light craft smaller cars
can be used and the vessels taken across
the isthmus almost as rapidly as a freight
train.
The cost of building and equipping such
a road across the isthmus Scott estimates
would not be over $10,000,000, while the
cost of a canal would be between $200,
000.000 and $300,000,000. Besides it could be
rushed through to completion in one
fourth the time' that would be required
to dig the canal. This would save the
Government about $200,000,000.
Scott's plans have been favorably re
ceived by the officials at Washington, and
the friends of the inventor here believe
he has overcome the obstacles that have
heretofore existed to a ship railway.
OrTDecember 17 last Scott wrote to Pres
ident McKinley, outlining his plan for a
ship railway across the isthmus to take
the place of a canal. Secretary Cortelyou
acknowledged the receipt of the letter,
stating the matter would be referred to
the Secretary of War.
The following letter from Secretary
Root shows the matter is receiving some
attention:
"War Department, Washington, January
.4, 1901. '
"Sir: Acknowledging receipt, by refer
ence from the Executive Mansion, of your
letter addressed to the President under
date of 17th ultimo, .presenting some ob
servations and suggestions concerning the
construction of a ship railway in connec
tion with the question of a ship canal, I
beg to inform you that the said communi
cation has this day been referred to the
Isthmian Canal Commission, Corcoran
building, this city. Very respectfully.
"ELIHU ROOT. Secretary of War."
John G. Walker, president of the Canal
Commission, wrote Scott on January 9,
saying the matter was before the commis
sion and would be considered at the meet
ing of the commission on the 17th of that
month. >Â¦.
If the Government acts on the sugges
tions of Mr. Scott, all the latter asks is
that the Government enter into a contract
with him so as to protect him from per
'Â¦ sons stealing his plans, and he will build
a .working model of his railway and cars.
When this is completed but 10 per cent of
the price agreed upon will be asked, and
the balance in six months after a railway
has been constructed and is carrying ships
across the isthmus.
Mr. Scott refuses to give any details of
his invention before a contract has been
made with the Government, for fear his
ideas may be stolen. Neither will he state
the price he wants for his lnventlo,n. Ho
is confident his railway will do the work
and expects the Government will have him
construct a working model.

Commander A. G. Menocal of the con
struction department of the United States
navy arrived here yesterday on the steam
ship Nippon Maru and Is at the- Oc
cidental. CommanUor Menocal went to
Manila last November under orders to se
lect a site for a naval station In or near
Manila. He said yesterday that he had
selected a most suitable site at Subig Bay,
about twenty-six miles from Manila, and
that the place was an Ideal spot for a
naval station. No work has yet been com
menced on the construction of wharves
and buildings, and nothing further will be
done until he has filed his report with the
Navy Department at Washington.
Commander Menocal says that the plan
of the Government probably will be to
construct a large drydock and have a
naval repairing yard on a gigantic scale,
so that the ships of the Asiatic squadron
can have all repairs made in the Philip
pines and not be compelled to come aJl
the way across the Pacific.
Commander Menocal will leave for
Washington to-day r.nd will immediately
upon his arrival there file his report. If it
Is favorably accepted plans will at once
be drawn for the construction of the yard,
and In a short time a force of experts will
be sent to Manila to superintend this
work.
Captain George F. F. "Wilde, who has
been relieved from the command of the
battleship Oregon, arrived also from tho
Orient on the steamship Nippon Maru.
He claims that Hollo would be the best
site for the naval station. He claims that
there is plenty of water there at all times,
and that It has the advantage over Subig
Bay of having two outlets, while the for
mer site has only one.
Captain Wilde, in speaking of the Ore
gon running on the reef near Hoo Kle in
June last year, claims that it was the moat
peculiar accident in the history of modern
navigation. He says the ship wes envel
oped in a dense fog and was steaming
at a low r.ate of speed. The charts showed
that they had plenty of water. Suddenly
the ship struck on a reef that was cov
ered by three fathoms of water. This
reef was never marked on the admiralty
charts at all.
Captain Wilde also claims had not the
Oregon b^en a magnificently built ship
she would have remained where she
was until to-day. After being taken off
â¢ the reef she was taken to Yokohama,
where she was temporarily repaired. In
the captain's opinion, the ship is as sound
as ever she was and that she can still run
as she is now for ten years and could, if
called upon, make as great a run around
the Horn as she did In her famous race
to Cubd during the Spanish-American
war.

MENOCAL RETURNS
FROM PHILIPPINES
Leopold Michel s, of the firm of Greene
baum, Well &'Michels, has recently called
the facts to the attention of the \Var De
partment, find has asked that the Call
iornian be considered the cheaper bidder
for supplies to be used on this coast or
in the Philippines whenever his bid is less
than that of any Eastern competitor with
the freight charges to this coast added.
Mr. Mlchels said yesterday that the
department hod agreed that this was to
the advantage of the Government, for it
Insured a greater number of bids, and the
cost would be really less to the Govern
ment than if the Government had to add
the freight charges to the price paid in
the" East for its Pacific Coast and Manila
supplies. Mr. Mlchels therefore thinks
that hereafter the San Franciscan will
have an even chance. the - freights being
taken into consideration.
As the matter now stands the.. Eastern
man and the California bidder -for sup
plies for use on the Pacific Coast of the
United States and in the Philippines are
not on an equality in many Instances.
Many materials that form a part of the
supplies in manufactured articles have to
be brought to the Pacific Coast from thÂ©
Eastern. States, and these, having to pay
heavy freight charges, Increase the cost
to the California manufacturer above the
figure thai the Eastern man has to base
his computations and bids on. If an
article, in other words, costs the Eastern
manufacturer a dollar to produce, the
freight rates on materials make the cost
to the Pacific Coast manufacturer a lit
tle more.
Bids will be opened in this and other
cities next, week for a large amount of
army supplies of various kinds. There
will be San Francisco bids as a matter
of course, but there is little expectancy
on the part of some of the bidders that
success will attend them as against the
Eastern competitors, and for a peculiar
reason.

Superior Judge Cook commenced an in
vestigation yesterSay to determine the
merit of the charges preferred by Benja
min Bernstein, a young man, against the
officials of the Preston- School of Indus
try at lone. Bernstein alleges that he was
flogged r.nd slapped in the face by. the of
ficials, who sought to force him to con
fess that he had set fire to the adminis
tration building of the Preston school, of
which charge he was Innocent. The young
man had been cent to the school aa an In
corrigible, though at the time judgment
was pronounced against him he requested
that he be sent to San Quentin.
David S. Hlrshberg, who was superin
tendent of the school up to December 26
last, testified that he was superintendent
when the boy came to the school, in June
1897. He was in the East when the fire
occurred in the administration building
and on his return he made an Investiga
tion and was satisfied that Bernstein had
nothing to do with it. The boy, he said
was a manageable boy. but was inclined
to be â¢ freakish" when he received letters
from home, ad he seemed to be very fond
of his mother, and became homesick. He
had him flogged at one time for destroy
ing music, but iater on the music was dis
covered and the lad exonerated. He was
confident it would ruin the boy to send
him to Ban Quentin.
Ex-Assistant District Attorney Hosmer
testified that when the boy was arraigned

if the boy had been represented by an at

The bill which passed thÂ© Senate a few
days ago allowing the soldiers who en
listed In Manila travel pay from San
Francisco to their homes gives to the men
of the Thirty-seventh and Thirty-sixth In
fantry and the Eleventh Cavalry the ben
efit of two different mileage laws. . When
these three regiments were organized a
law, since repealed, allowed the men
travel pay from Manila to San Francisco,
amounting to about $450. When the State
regiment was sent home to be mustered
out the men remaining behind were al
lowed this sum provided they re-enlisted
in the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh In
fantry and the Eleventh Cavalry, which
were then being organized. The offer was
made for the purpose of keeping in the
service men who had had service in the
islands, and proved an alluring bait. The
regiments were recruited in a short time.
The law makers of the United States
about the time the organizations were
completed /thought the payment of mile
age across the ocean was proving too
good a thing, as the men were brought
over on Government transports. They
consequently repealed the law giving the
soldiers this money and only allowed the
men sent home thereafter mileage from
San Francisco to their homes.
Philanthropic politicians have since been
at work securing the passage of the new
bill, with the result that the men of the
three regiments now en route from Ma
nila are benefited by both the old and the
new bill. This means a great deal to the
men. as had the bill not passed they
would have -had to pay their passage home
out of their savings.-

Â¦ The recruits sent to San Francisco from
various parts of the United States and
attached to the First. Second and '{hird
Provisional battalions are not to form the
entire Twenty-sixth Regiment of Infan
try, as was at first supposed. A commu
nication was received yesterday from the
War Department announcing that the
First and .Second Provisional battalions
were selected to form the First Battalion
of the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh
Infantry regiments, the first outfits to
be organized under the provisions of the
new army bill.
The First and Second battalions are un
der orders to proceed to Manila on the
16th inst., and the officers upon whom the
work of getting them into shape has de
volved win accompany them, remaining
with them until relieved by the officers
provided under the new bill, when they
will rejoin their regiments.
The First and Second Provisional bat
talions have been constantly drilled for
the last two months and have reached
a degree of efficiency in military tactics
that puts them on a par with many an
older organization. The honor of being se
lected as the foundation upon which new
regiments are to be built repays them for
the many hours of hard drill they have
endured. Captain Hardin and Lieutenant
Rethers, to whom was intrusted the for
mation of the new commands, are greatly
pleased with the result of their labors.
The preliminary work of mustering out
the volunteers will commence this morn-
Ing at the Presidio. A band of medical
officers, under Major Guy L. Edle, has
been appointed and will examine the phys
ical condition of the men upon their dis
charge. The day of mustering out has
been set for February 20.' In addition to
his duties as examining physician Major
Edie has been appointed medical inspec
tor of regimental and volunteer camps at
