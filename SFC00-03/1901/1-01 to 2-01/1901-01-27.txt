One of the most curious of duels; say*

which was fought In 13C3. The combatants

appointed day M. de Grandpre entered tha
car of one balloon.- with his second, and
M. le Pique, with his second, mounted
the other in the garden of the Tuileries.
before an Immense crowd of admiring
spectators. "When all was ready the ropes
were cut and the balloons shot upward
for a distance of about half a mile above
th* earth. The wind being light they wers
able to keep the distance of about eighty
yards 'between each other with which
they started. On reaching the agreed alti

Her history is interesting, not alone be

the old adage "the vafea cf sin is deaxh."
which purport is that It usually comes in
some sudden and terrible form, such as
suicide, accident under some awful cir
cumstance, or assasslnaiicn; and the man

and then dies peacefully In bed. Gurround

Benny Riley was not one of these. An lnti

well as a child and lived neighbor to her
for years while she was youngr. even then
showing a tendency to throw all thought
of honor to the winds, and who met and
remonstrated with her later, gives me an
opportunity to throw more light, on her
life and character and trace at intervals
her career from chlldifood to the grave.
It. B. Riley was one of the pioneers of
Portland, his family being among the
early settlers of Eusrene. Or. 3 His wife
was a woman of hizh temper, which the
did not make any noticeable effort to
govern.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Rilty were of - north
of Ireland birth. Mr. Riley was In the
Â¦wood business and made a. comfortable
living for his family, who resided in a
nice home and enjoyed all the comforts
but few of the luxuries of life.
There were three children â Bonny and
two brothers. The father was easy goini;
and Indulgent, none too strict with either
himself or others. The mother was hieh

When her mother would send her to

to make a purchase she would always ap

mother that she had apent it for the pur

much spending money as she should and
so the only way was to help herself,

About two years ago Urn, Forian Weiss'
A BOUT two years ago I
-tJ- . made an examination '"'
of Willie Weiss and found
that he had a disease known
as purpura haemorrhagica.'
During the examination I
noticed something more. I
saw tliat iheapex beat zuas
on iJie opposite, of. iionnal
side. His heart is on the
right side.
Upon further examina
tion, testing by percussion, I
found the liver to be on , the
left side.
J. H. HEALY, ZM.D.
of 928 Natoma street took one of her flock
to. the College of Physicians and Surgeon's
to have the wise people there tell what
was the matter with him. Ever since he
was' a tiny fellow . those queer rainbow-
A SAN FRANCISCO BOY WHO HAS HIS HEART ON THE WRONG SIDE
colored spots had been appearing on his
face and body whenever a- wall 'or a piece
of furniture or a door casing had tapped
him the least little tap. /Sometimes the
upota would appear on hlÂ« body:, when
there had. been no bruise, whatever.
* Th e wise men of trie college;; put their
heads, together and came to the, conclu
sion that concerned abnormally thin walls
of the blood vessels and < a- disease- called
purpura haemorrhagica. But that . was
not all. In the course of the examina
tion Dr. Heaiy made a startling discov
ery. It came Â«bout In somewhat this
fashion. ': ;. : â¢ -. i' .Y.--
He' had been noticing only the spots.
When all -at once, his eye was attracted
by a movementâ the steady, hammering
movement of the heart beat. And the
queer- thing was that It was on, the right
â that is. the wrong side.
Tests proved conclusively the existence
of this abnormality. Further tests dis
covered the liver to be on the left side,
correspondingly reversed. Percusnton
told this taleâ percussion, which finds thÂ»
liver where the sound Is dull. The mis
placement of tlv?" heart is probably ac
countable for his disease.
Willie Weiss doesn't care \ where his
heart is nor his liver, either. He Is sturdjr Â»
of body and rosy of face now, for thJJ)
long-named disease does not trouble him
as much as It did. You win find him the
blessedest. sunniest of second graders

spell and write arid read with the best .
of them, and If you saw him busily doins
all these, things you would never In tha

It doesn't seem to matter at all now. BuÂ«
when he grows up? }
. Suppose he should grow old enough to
have a "very best" and to take her driv
ing and buy her sodas. And suppose she
should see him putting away her billet
doux or her photograph In his right vest
pocket Instead of the left. Wouldn't she
have, a right to be very, angry. Indeed?
For who could expect her to believe that
he was stowing It away next his heart.
after^all? Who could expect her to ac
"cept/any explanation so absurd as that
Willie's heart is on the wrong, or. rather,
the right side? Wouldn't It be the most
natural thing in the world for her to aay:
"Â¥\, fl, Mr. Weiss: such tales are all very
easy to tell, but as for'my swallowing
them â that's another matter!"
.But, bless his heart, he runs and plays
and is hungry and: happy and loving Just

It may sound strangely to hear persons
talk about a "tired steel axle" or a "fa

heard along railways and in machine
shops, and is considered correct. "The s

may be your thought^ but experts famil

work makes it tired, and that It needs
rest, as you do.

degree of accuracy how many eggs are
placed in any given shipment or are con

quantity by the number . of females

How various -and how. far- wide of the

the following: One fish "culturist estimate^

another puts the number at 6C7QQO. 'D*r. H.

ova in process of maturation. ' . '
These statements are'made to show the

Â¦tjs^nESIDING on a little truck farm
JL-^ near Omaha, is a man who sheds his

new epidermis every year eince

formation began exactly on the 27th day
of June. Prior to that time it came either
In July or August About a month is con
sumed In the process of discarding the
old cuticle and the appearance of . the
r.pw. During this time the finger and
toe nails become loose and are discarded,
Â»*w nails coming In, but more time is re
quired In growing the nails to matutity.
. The man who annually undergoes this
â¢trange process of desq.uama.tion is 3. O.
Buskirk, who was born la Clark County.
Mo.. May SO. 1S50. He Is the father of
three daughters and a son now. grown.
Were It not that his hair is slightly tinned
with gray Mr. Buskirk would be regarded
as a man of 49, for he 13 strongly built,
robust and agile. His complexion is gocd
and his eye 1b bright.
*'I was neve! 1 elck In my life," said he,
"and have taken but very little medfeine
tor these attacksâ only a l-ttle something
to allay the fever that accompanies them.
It If a freak of nature. The doctors can
not tell what It is or why it is. nor can
they prevent It. Very few have ever
inea, ana I won t let any more of them
experiment on me. . Atter the'sktn has
been shed I am as good as new and feel
like a boy of 18. Yet I dread the process
of peeling, for it Irritates and debilitates!
I have eaten little or nothing for three
days and am weak. Many years have I
hoped that some scientist would find a
means of preventing the recurrence of
my trouble. . Â¦ -
"I have never heard of but one similar
caseâ a man in Montanaâ but that was
Borne years ago and I have "forgotten his
name. This foot of mine is itchine ter
ribly to-day," continued Mr. Buskirk, as
he removed shoÂ« and sock. " * . ; Â¦ -
No further evidence was needful to al-
lay doubt as to the truth of this man's
statements. The scarfskln was peeling
off. Part of it. hung down below the flesh
of the foot, resembling a white thin moc L
casin partially slipped from the heel. It
was not pleasant to look- upon. The skin'
of the body exfoliates In flakes. . J' v
. "I could pull this all off now," explained
Mr. Buskirk, "but If Â¦ I did so the ,new<
skin which is forming would be so tender
I could 1 not walk.' So I must let if take-
Its own time in coming off, which may jbe
a week or ten days." â¢ :Â¦' , } 'Â¦
The hands undergo the same re-creation.
The discarded cuticle -of the" hand's which
Mr. Buskirk .has .preserved looks '.like thin
white rubbejr, gloves/ a i\Ule tattered and
* " Â¦ â¢ . y 1
torn. At, the newspaper man's request
Buskirk- stepped to his, room and got his
erstwhile "-. hands 'and permitted photo
graphs to/be.madeof them/ He- was not
a bit anxious .to parade his Infirmity, t yet
he is willing to do all he may. to the-'end
that some scientist may correctly diag*
nose his case. 'He Is a man of good na
ture and intelligence and disposed to rer
spond to every reasonable request.
1 'JYou see, my finger nails are beginning
: to loosen," said he. exhibiting the .tips of
'his fingers, "and. the 1 skin on my Â¦ hanfls Is

Pklb that is- forming underneath, and If I
tap it with a lead, pencil at such times it
.gives off' a\sharp* sound, ;like striking a
piece of celluloid or stiff leather. Finally,
by opening and" closing my . hands often,
the skin parts along the edge, and then,
by helping. along the process with a pock
etknlfe, the piece' comes off whole."
Buskirk has several interesting souve- :
nirs in the form of patches of skin which
he has shed from, his hands and feet at -
various times during his career, and in -
.every Instance these present perfect out-
. lines of the members 'from which they
came. For.example, the "bark" from the
palm of tiiÂ» Sand mtgnt easily be mis
taken at first stance for one-half of a
.glove. Moreover, the thick, callous-like
skin retains the mysterious lines of the
hand of which the palmist makes so
much. In this connection, there Is in the
Buskirk case a fact which tends to dis
prove the entire theory' of palmistry, be
ing evidence that the lines of the hands
change with time and are not unalterably
preserved, as has. been supposed. Among
his grewsome keepsakes is a. piece of
skin taken from his right hand when he
was 10 years old. It Is observed that
while the general conformation of the
.lines corresponds with that of his right
hand as It is to-day, still the Individual
lines are longer' now than then, even after
making allowance for the growth of the
member as a whole. Fully a third has
been added to the length' of ' the" famous
,*'jlfe".'line. ' It Is as Jf destiny had rnten'd-
ed rum originally to be of brier exwrenea

THIS MAN SHEDS SKIN LIKE A SNAKE
THE SU^DAT A3AJL.LI. -
2The wonderful laboratory of nature was
doing somewhat experimental work in
those days, and the first animals created
had coarse life cellsâ that is. the units of
which their flesh, bicod and bone were
composed nre large, and when viewed un
der the microscope are plainly seen with
lower magnifying powers than those of
animals of the present day. which, wheth
er they be great as the elephant or small
as a humming bird, have uniformly fine
cells composing their, tissues.
When the world was young all of the
organic growths were of simple and ele
mentary structure. Nature had not then
learned to hide her secrets as she now
does. Botanists find that In studying the
flora of the carboniferous age they dis
cover the key to the intricate systems of
plant growth which are now required to
enable the vegetable kingdom to hold its
own e gainst the increasing climatic rigors
and the ever-growing mierocosmlc ene
mies that make the existence of even a bit
of moss a continuous struggle. As the
vegetable was then nimple. so animals
were planned In a primitive, rough-hewn
way, for they had an easy path to travel
During the early days of the coal ag?,
when all the earth was a great steamy
paradise, with a climate like the interior
of a hothouse, the saurirns, large and
small, lived and thrived in countless num
bers. As all things Â¦ have small begin
nings, so the lizard family, which then
predominated, began small, and the
Eatrachoseps were the first of them.
know why w* live; what life's substance
is- and the scientists of two continents
are looking to it to learn the secret ot
their being. The species is the oldest now
living on earth, and not only thnt. but In
conceivably older than most of _ the ex
tinct animals. The mastodons, clyptodons
and any number of genera whose former
presence on earth Is now known but by
their fossil remains, were newcomers, and
in their time looked upon as parvenus by
the very ancient Batracheseps.
\vA/ / * Ask 1he Batrachopops. It
XJx/ !:ro\V5.
A small, si'.ent saurian, living
but in California, and here only where the
Sfmpcrvirer.s redwood? shade the streams.
Olfitr tr.:in ihe hills they live on, are the
families of both tree and lizard. Older
than the continent itself, which was but
Â«=!!me of the sea-washed depths when they
wew old inhabitants of lost Atlantis or
Kinking Oceania.*
Both of the species belong to a past geo
logical a^e and are unfitted for coping
with existing conditions which are slowly
bringing about their extinction.
But whle the redwood is of an old fam
ily; so old that it grows by the primitive
method of turning its leaves into limbs
and trur.k. yet !t is but a new laid ess
compared to the venerable and slow-going,
brown-backed water lizards which crawl
about Its roots.
When at Ia5t science learns the myste
rious difference between the man and the
ecry^e. it will have this rare animal to
thank for it. For more million:* of years
than any other species which has ever
existed, the Batrachoserr has lived and
carried In its keeping the mystery that
every living mortal seeks to unravel. Car
ried its secret through the ages passing
on from generation to generation.
The Belgian Government has become ac
quainted with the fact that there is still
living in California this species of the
strange genera that swarmed the world
Â¦when the mammoth plesiovaurus swam his
forty-foot body through the warm waters,
and his thirty-foot neck waved inquisi
tively among the giant vegetable growths
which overlaid the earth and hid the sun.
We are a long way from the centers of
science that feel themselves to dominate
the world. Ours is a land of wonders
that w<? do not appreciate. The Batracho-
Feps has been crawling in our foresis, un
noticed except by a few scientists here,
and unheard of by those cf foreign coun
tries.
The first of them ever taken to Kurope
Â¦were carried over by- Professor Van der
Xaillen <tf this city some months ago. He
eays: "When thore dignified scientific
gentlemen saw crawling before them liv
ing specimens of a type which they sup
posed tud vanished into the realms of the
fossils hundreds of thousands of years ago
they jum;.ed for very joy. When they
learned what our scientists had already
done in the v.ay cf investigation, they de
termined that they, t03. would come here
to the home of the Ftrange living relics
of the past and work at the unfolding
problem."
Professor Le\Brun at Antwerp was the
rr.an ln.aily decided upon as the one best
fitted by reason of his biological re
pearches to take uj> the study of the Ba
trat-hosL-fiS, as he has made embryology

searches from which he had been before
debarred.
These creatures of the carboniferous ago
require a mflder climate than Is now af
forded on any part of the earth except
California, and accordingly they have
perished from every other section of It.
Even here they can only be found In cer
tain limited localities, and while appar
ently numerous are no more plenty than
will be required by the demands of sci
ence, which In their case will acquire th<*
greater part of Its knowledge only at the
cost of the lives of the animals which
supply It.
For all of our lives we young Callfor
nlans have seen the patient Batrachoseps
wandering painfully over the dry land, or
lying In blissful Idleness In the bottom of
stagnant pools, rising once In an hour
perhaps to swallow a mouthful of air. an
we do a drink of water. Why they lived,
was always a source of wonderment.
There was no pleasure In their life un
less it was the mere joy of living, and
of that they gave no sign. They appar
ently served no useful purpose and had
no part In the economy of nature.
But all the while, unknown to us. ther*
had been a mission In life for them. Now
It is about to be fulfilled.
"Art la long and time Is fleeting." the7
would have said to themselves. "Our
lives go on apace and our numbers de
crease, yet has not our time come, nor
Is our purpose accomplished."
But at last science is catching up to
nature and beginning to read the stories
hidden In rock and stream. Thicker they
come as one gives the key to another,
and the understanding broadens 'I with,
what it acquires.
What Is life, and why do we want to
know what It la?
Moat of all. so that we may conserve
. that which we Dosseas.
Scientists have so far done nothing pos-
sustenance provided by nature. Coarse
life cells would of necessity have large
Interstices between them. Riving room for
lodgment of microbes, bacteria, parasites
or whatever it Is that produces disease.
There vo ill d also be a lack of sensitive
ness, quickness, elasticity, resistance and
all of those qualities which indirectly
rive power to win In a struggle. There
fore In the slow changes of time, by that
* process of natural selection known as the
.â¢urvival of tb<j fittest, it came about that

peared everywhere except here in Califor
nia, where the climatic moderation and
bountiful food Â«upplies have enabled this
one small species to outlast its genera by
ages.
â¢ While they are the last, they are not the
only kind of antediluvian reptiles that
have lived hÂ«-rÂ». There has recently been
discovered ,near Los Angeles a bed of
skeletons of mighty monsters of a bygone
era: whose petrified bones show*^hat "\heir
bodies must have been seventy-five feet tn
length and weighed hundreds of tons, and
It Is by some supposed that the vast pe
troleum stores of the State are but the
oily^ residues of the decomposition of their
huge carcasses accumulating In the lake
bods of early geological ages.
' Strange that the understanding of our
own-lives, upon which so much depends,
should hinge upon the study of this ani
mal of the typ* of Ions aieo; but science,
in this a* In everything else, must begin
at the beginning, or as near to it as pos
sible, and the Bntrnchosens fg far and
away the most primitive of all the fauna

The micro5ccp'st comes closer than any

THE girl sculptress of San Francisco
lives in her little studio, five tflights
up. in the tiptop of an old building

first rays of sunshine, arrive through the
quaint little round skylights in the roof

work and she does not Unlsh . until the
sunshine departs by the way it, came,
leaving her aione'ln the>dusk.
Once there was a little girl down on a
farm near Nlles. Her name was Sybil
Easterday, and she was very fond of play
ing In the mud.
But It rraa not mud pieu she made. It
was -the same sort of things that she
wrought out of. the putty which she
scraped from\ the edges of the Â¦ window
panes, and the same sort of things that
her mother found the butter patties made
into on the . pantry shelves. In ; shor*.
Sybil Easterday was a spulptress^in em
bryo, and it. was genius that wSs trying
to work Its way out through the mud and
putty- and butter.
When she grew up tnere was an in
teresting collection of cruJe wood carv
ing in her room at the Easterday farm
house and there van no p^ace on the
whole . farm until she had gained her
parents' consent to come to San Francisco
for a course of art instruction.
She came and.the Hopkins Art Institute
found In her one of Its cleverest pupils.
Onithe farm she had- dabbled, too. in
painting, and from under her paint brush
there sprung yellow haystacks and gray
oaks with such crude naturalness and
realistic effect as to make plodding Illus
trators stare and arouse the interest of
the instructors. But for her painting she
did' not -care, so much; her passion was
sculpture. : and she into clay
modeling and Its accompanying studies
of anatomy with a determination* born of
a great -love for.-h^r work.
She made .progress. Such ' astonishing
progress lhat Yhos<> of ordinary clever
ness stopped to make note and congratu
late. As soon as she had mastered suf
ficient: technique tu work independently
she took her studjo and shut herself- up
with her work, and while the sun shone
no one was admitted. Earnestness and
ambition kept, her within her four walls
and the little art world of San Francisco
had almost forgotten her until it found
her work prominently placed In ' the In
stitute of Art exhibitions.
Since then she has been an acknowl
edged factor of importance in San Fran
cisco art circles, tier study figures have
appeared at all the principal art exhibi
tions and .have been given prominent po
sitions. - ' v
The girl sculptress is independent as
well In Ideas and the execution of them
as In bread-winning. When the first bar
rel of plaster for casts was brought into
her studio and the ivnlte powder left a
little trail alone the floor; when her tub
of wet clay tipped over and she found her
hands and face and aer skirts all covered
with the sticky substance, then Mlsa
Kasterday had one of her independent
ideas and she proceeded to put it into ex
ecution. The next day when the baker
boy called the door was opened for him
by a young person in a light flannel shlit
and white duck trousers. The young per
son had a sculptor's knife" and a little
wad of clay In one hand and the other
was held out with wide-stretched fingers,
fresh from the tub mixture. But what
made the baker-boy stare was the young
person's head. It wai a. mass of fluffy
red-brown hair, bound up loosely with a
band of black velvet and shading the seri
ous face and earnest "ulue eyes of the girl
sculptress. Â»

work. ' . Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦,Â¦â¢ ,
Miss Easterday's visitors and the baker
boy have long since become accustomed to
her practical eccentricity and the girl
sculptress herself has become so appre
ciative of its comforts that it Is with a
sigh she dons her street attire, which sha
never does until the moment of her goln.Â£
out. â¢ .
Many are the comments of the little Bo
hemian circle of artists anent the girl
sculptress. They say she 13 strange, ani
odd. and queer, but they unanimously
agree that she is clever and Independent
and that she is earnest and ambitious.
She herself Is indifferent to all com

1 pen unsuccessful In everything. I wish to
prrflt hy my experience and to cult'.\-ate thass
oual'.ties necessary to success in which I havÂ»
l>f*n Inckinp. I havÂ» nÂ«t saved sr much as
I ourht. ar>f". am resolved t-i pra-fre a rigid

Firftâ To mnVe every cent I can.

troupht in contact.
Slvthâ To stay at heme l^fin and be more
srciol.
Seventhâ To strive to think consecutively and
dec^t quickly.
The^e resolutions are a good lndf* to
Mr. George'* mind at that time. He is
about to make another start in life. He
in *>n the last rung of the ladder and
"dead broke." Naturally . tho first Â«hin;r
r.ow is for him to "make every cent he
can." then "to spend nothing â¢ unnoires
frarily." At times in his li'e he had
made pood salaries*, and the vision* of
money wasted are not pleasant when
f ctual hunger stares you in the face. The
third resolution is certainly uniqu 1 ? and
has a bit of delicious humor In it. al
though at that time any thoughts of a
Joke were furthest from Mr. George's
thoughts. The Idea of saving five ;ents
a week, even if It be borrowed from a
friend. Is splendid. The frequent use of
the word "if'\ shows the number .of
schemes whl^h had been- tried and found
wanting, until finally GeorpÂ» has lost all
confidence In positive assertion and is
content "not to run in debt IF it can be
avoided." There Is a pathetic ring In
that "to stay at home less and be more
social." ' Â¦ . .'. . â¢ -
Things then began to mend. Both hus
band and wife did what they could. 'Mrs.
George managed to pay their rent by
pewlng for the ladlady, and finally George
himself obtained regular employment.
He was now 26 years old. and this period
narks the date of the commencement of
his career as a writer. : â¢ * â¢
His article. "Sic Semper Tyrannis!" In
spired ' by the j assassination ' of Lincoln
and which appeared in the " Alta Cali
fornia, won for him a place as special
leporter on , that- paper. , He had written
it on the spur of the moment and thrust
It in the editor's box with ; merely, his
initials as signature., and was surprised
to see it appear In type the. next morning;.
It was not, " however, ' until some \ years
later that Mr. Â¦ George . was able \to leave
the composing-ropm for, good and all and
de .jte himself to the pen alone. He then
made a quick : rise from the . position of
extra reporter on the . San Francisco
Times .to that of its managing editor. 1 ' %
This part, of Mr. Henry /Jr.'s
book will be found especially interesting
to San Franciscans, containing : so I much
ti*. it does about local events and people.
The life of . extreme poverty, was now
over for Henry George, but. it had been
a lesson that he never could. forget, and
all his energies were devoted to the lead-
Ing question, 'â¢Why poverty accompanies
wealth in advancing civilization.!' His
past experiences and present studies of
life In- New . York^ and > San Francisco
finally resulted In the book that made Its
author famousâ "Progress and Poverty,
an' Inquiry Into the Cause of - Industrial
Depressions arid of .'_ the Increase of
Want With the Increase of Wealth."
Mr. George set most of the . type for tbe
book himself. There .Â¦ was ; the usual
trouble about finding a publisher,' but the
work was finally- undertaken ; by â¢ Apple
ton & Company and appeared in 1579. '.It
soon ' began to attract tho attention of
the reading world. . -
In thÂ« fall oi JLES1 Mr.' George went to
1? an almost exact fat-simile of the orig
inal, even to the eclor of the time-stained
paper.
"The Xew Ensland Primer" was one of
the greatest books ever published. It
went through Innumerable, editions; It
reflected In a marvelous w.-iy the spirit
of tho ase that produced it; and con
tributed, perhaps more than any other
book except tbe Bible, to the molding of
those sturdy generations that gave to
America Us liberty and Its Institutions.
Even late reprints, of "ThÂ© Vrimnr" are
scarce and expensive, only tfÂ» he found

Ilooswa and Others of tiie Boundaries
AV. A. Fraser has utilized well his time
of six seasons spent on the Athabasca ar.^
Saskatchewan rivers In the far norths
west of Canada by grlvlnfr to us his story
of animal life, "Mooswa and Others of the
Boundaries." Those who enjoyed Kip
ling's "Jungle Stories" and Ernest Seton-
Thompson's tales of American animals
cannot fail to appreciate Mr. Fraser's en
tertaining style. He is accused by soma
of Imitating' Kipling:, but even this- would
be better than no Mooswa at all. Ha
has studied nature and animal Ufa well,
as his careful attention to details and
characteristics shows.
The animals do> most of the talking,
with just enough by man to show the part
he plays in their lives. - Mr. Arthur Hem-
Ing is deserving of special mention for tha
striking: illustrations which form no small
part of the attractiveness of the book.

Ople Read, well known as the author cf
"A Yankee from the "West" and Tha
Waters of Caney Fork,"* has added to his
laurels, by a new story picturing incident
ally those Immortal Americans who
fought and died in the battle of the
Alamo. The historical element Is not. how
ever, the main part of the story, for It Is
rather a psychological study of affairs of
the heart of a middle-aged man of the
wcrld. It tells of a Southerner, Luctan.
Howardaon. an ex-Congressman for tha
State of Texas, whose heart fs won by tne
fascinations of the heroineâ a woman of
no ordinary type. The fair one Is under
a pledge which prevents her returning the
love of this man whom she really would
chcose above all others, and it Is this
state of affairs which gives to the author
his motif. . The story is full of exciting
Incidents and strong situations. The dia

THERE haÂ« Just been published a
"Life of Henry George," by his son.
Henry George Jr. Mr. George Jr.
is deserving of the highest praise
for the able way In which he has woven
together the Interesting facts in his fath
er's life. He writes with the greatest fair
ness despite the fact that his subject is? his
own parent. He allows his relationship
In no way to Interfere with exact state
ment Â»n<l of course his kinship is of ad
vantage inasmuch as he is ablfi to give
\:s a vaft amount of private correspond
ence and matter from the diaries of his
father which otherwise we should not
have.
The life of Henry George reads like a
novel. Aside from the special interest
which w*Â» of California must feel in h

much in the book that will appeal to the

Leckefi nt from a worldly standpoint it
vas certainly the bfclffhl of foolishness.
yet ore cannot but admire the pluck and
uncomplaining fortitude with which both
these young people stood by their bar
rain In the dark days which were to fol
low.
The Georges went to Sacramento and
there their first child was born, a boy,
â¢who was named 'after his father. Sir.
George had done pretty well in. the first
year of his marriage and had managed
to pay most of the old bills contracted in
Ban Francisco. Now. at odd hours, he
Â«?n<iÂ«>avored to pick up money In any hon
orable way. At one unÂ« he hired out
as ticket-taker for a lecture given by
Mark Twain. Like mjet Californians in
thc6e days he could nut resist the fascin
ation of gambling In mining stocks with
the usual disastrous results which gen
erally followed ventures of this kind.
Finally the little family, returned to San
Francisco and -then began the darkest
days they were to know. Fortunately for
them it was the darkness before the dawn.
but while It lasted it bordered close on
trageoy. Mr. George writes in his diary:
I came near starring to death, and at on*
time I was so close to tt that I think I
chould have dor.* ao but for the Job of print-
Sr.c a. few cards which enabled us to buy a
little cornmeal. In tfcls darkect time In my
life my second child was born.
The frightful sufferings of the family
are best told in the author's own word*.
After such an experience as this It is not
to be wondered at that Mr. George's deep
est sympathy was ever with the poor and
that he believed povertv and crime arÂ»*

Nervous Breakdown. .
Albert Abrarns. A.M.. M. T>.l (Heidel
berg), F. R. M. S-. is the author of a
recently published pamphlet, "Nervous
Breakdown." The subject is treated In a
scientific way. but not above the head of
the average reader, and in these days of
busy workers and brain fatigue It shoull
be found helpful realinff. The author
carefully considers the various causes of
nervous breakdown, classifying and ex
plaining as he proceeds. He then dwells
at some length on the general symptoms,
afterward* taking up the special symptoms
and suggesting the treatment for cases
from various causes.. (Published by tho

The New England Primer.
GInn & Co. have just put out from their
Athenaeum Press a carefully prepared
facsimile of "The New England Primer"
from an original published between the
years 17S3 and 1790, and now owned by
G. A. PllmDtnn of New York. The last
sether with 'a. "resume, of the development
of l literature and . Intellectual growth, as
.well- as tho'proBrcsslon In modes of travel
and "communication: ./The Oregon expan
sion, marks another step in the territorial
growth rind the' general advance west
.ward. A memorable occasion was thatâ
the -first breaking of the Oregon trail In
June, 1843, when 200 wagons and 1300 head
of cattle made their r perilous way from
,.Westport. near .where; Kansas City now
stands, to tbe. vast wilderness of Oregon.
Then follows r. the", acquisition-' of Texas,
the conquest of California and the Htrug
â¢gle for Kansas. and Nebraska. Professor
Sparks closes _wlth some remarks on the
increase of well-being; among the people
and the beginning, of; a colonial system.

prophetic" opinion In the cloeing chapter
,of his book cannot be without Interest:
â¢ To the student of the larger politics the cul
Â¦ minating point in the territorial expansion of
â¢*thr American people, made possible by their
â¢ eoclal expansion, is found in the- spread of
Knglish Fpeech. The English of th.e Americans

In a negative way science has done
something, for it has conquered diseases
which interfered with life, but for the
normal body, healthy to begin with, fort
unate and without accident or disease,
fcience can do nothing, and is powerless
to arrest Its steady inarch to the grave.
f It - is well known that the' body has
the power of renewing Itself; that every
seven years each one of its molecules Is
replaced by a new one. Thus there Is
no reason why an old body should not
be Â£s good as new. Sharks and some
other Inhabitants of the tea. as far ub
Is known, have no time limit set upon
their lives, but live and grow until from
v*ry bulk they become fco unwieldy -that
they surpass all of their, prey In slzo
bo much that it can dodge and escape
their clumsy motions.' Then, weakened
from lack of substance, they In turn arÂ«
attacked by smaller but more vigorous
enemies and destroyed.

Back gathered about the neck. For
it's all about that bewitching little pick

koop your money out of its hands.
You non-reformers who listen, how
many times have you seen your purses
collapse when the French corsrt hnd laid
hold of them? Twfive or fifteen dollars is
nothing to sper.d for that Lit of steel aii'j
ribbon and lace. And if you are one whose
purse flattens faster than it fills t then you
have seen the time when the cost of a
corset left you hatless or bootless or
EO-.-nJess. All because you must have the
perfect Parisian outline.
Of course, you must. Who blames you?
But did you know that you can have it
for the price of $2 35 and an afternoon's
labor?
"Tape," you say. No, not tape, by any
means; but satin ribbon, the best on the

to be a double-faced satin, two inches

a silk one costs only 25 cents, and the rib

The chances are you have sewing silk
in the house. Get it out and you are
ready to begin.
If your steels are too long, file them
down. Eleven Inches is the required
length. .
Cut ribbon to same length in half and
cover the steel3, the corded edges In front.
lap the top and bottom pieces or 2 and 5
over the center ones. This makes the
proper curves at the bottom.
The side piece or 6 comes next. Cut four
of this kind, as they are doubled to gain
extra strength. Put together In the same
way as you did the front pieces, number
6 lapping over 4 and 2 over 3.
There are only three pieces that form
the side back.
Baste 7, S and 9 to side. part 6. lapping
7 and 9 over 8. -Now you are ready to use
the last and third large piece, or number
10. Fit the, pieces upon 10 as they were
fitted upon 6. The fullness, which is made
by the small pieces," form3 the necessary
fullness to flt over the hips.
After the side is well basted together
stitch on the machine. '. This must be done
or else you will be forever in a state of
ripping.
At this stage of the manufacture the
front steels are the only stiff part of the
garment. Stitch the sides or number 6
into five whalebone slips, about three-
fourths of a- Inch apart, and cut the
whalebones down to flt. Insert and. turn
over edges.
*The back or 10 la divided Into four parts.
Be' sure and leave the second space from
the back vacant. This must be used for
the eyelets.
The finishing' touch is ready. Make
what is left of your ribbon into the most
chic bow that you know how to make
and catch it In a Frenchy, flyaway fash
ion in front. . If you have any friend In
the millinery business get her to make
the bow, for bowmaking Is an art that
few amateurs ever master.
If you must have more frllla and fur
belows, a yard of lace and baby ribbon
may be stitched at the top of the corset.
Liace at 40 cent* will do very well and
still keep below the three dollar mark.
This corset will flt any waist from twen
ty to twenty-six inches. If It should prove
too large, number 6 may be trimmed off.

book and rising.
"There have beer, yes, a thousand
things wrong with me, but there will not

crank and the kicker and the fool, why
haven't : you ' hired some one to boot me
all over town?" \
'T must go upstairs and shut the win-Â».

The idea was that If Air. Bowser was

he was *as good as gold and then used all
her power -of persuasion to get him to
sit dcv.-n.to his cigar and newspaper aga'n.
She couldn't accomplish it. however. HI*

ALL was peace and harmony in thÂ«

her eyes and purred in contentment. By

around, and then said:
'â¢Mrs. Bowser, New Year's day has come

"Yes." Fhe answered.
"At the beginning cf the neV year most
people look back over the last twelvo
months and call up their shortcomings
and determine to avoid them In thi

"It Is what they call 'swearing off,"
Isn't it?'
"Tes. It has pot fo that everybody

and proper that one should decide to do
this or that to better things. I didn't Bay
anything to you on New Year's day, but
yet I had several things in mind."
Mrs. Bowser looked at him and felt a
flight chill pass over her. If he had de
termined on any change of conduct it
Â¦would end In a riot in less than two hours.
"No; I didn't pay anything on that
â¬ay," he continued, but I'm going to say
something now. I have firmly and fully

f=^HE musical people of the town are
II getting a .warm welcome ready, for

The would-be musical pÂ«*ople are
less excited. They could not at first see
much In the Hensehels because these
artists have not big. showy voices l:ke
the grand_opera people and they do not
come to town with' two-score trunks and
the blowing of many trumpets. They are
such a quiet two. without any bluster
about them in the way they leave the
ferry or In the way that they step,casu
ally out upon, the stage. Still- even the
would-be musicals are beginning to realize
and. preparing to appreciate.
But those who are fully aware of the
treat in store for them are the people
who don't. care whether a thing is called
big or not, but pimply love the music that
reaches the hearth These have heard and
have been moved before *; by . the sweet
musical gems these artists sing, and they
want to, hear again. .

the Bad Boy. "It's a play, and I'll tell

The boy hunted ui> the bouncer, garo
him $5. explained that the old groceryman
meant no harm, and sent him around to
look after that aged Lothario.
Threa seconds later, as the boy stood
at the stage entrance, he heard, a wild
commotion, and the old groceryman
peared, traveling at the rate of sixty
miles an hour. Across his mouth was a
smear of pink grease-paint. His coat was
torn and a handful of his whiskers was
gone.
In his wake rushed an Infuriated Chi

whiskers in one har.d and brandishing a

could summon up were addressed to tha

had flown, "but I'll be ttctotaJly gol

PECK'S BAD BOY TAKES
THE GROCERYMAN
TO CHINATOWNHAZING at the United States Mili
tary Academy Is full of meaning
to the r.ewly arrived son of a great
general or the relative of a fear
less naval officer. The cadet "plebe"
whose name has gone before him is a
marked man. The old adage that "All
men are equal" is observed more prac
tically at West Point than in any other
square mile- of territory in the United
Butes. The cadets are democratic, and
they love to change the color of blue
blooded miutary aristocracy.

cadets forcing tabasco sauce, plates of
moiiifes or cord oaths upon tneir teiiows
with the single wta of benefiting their
comrades.
"It shows what stuff the- 'DlebeiV. are
made of." say the hazers In indorsing
their customs and traditions. Â¦ Â¦
Forms of exercising wens abolished by
class vote about a year ago.. Public sen
timent became so strong against the acad
emy that the cadets themselves deemed It
expedient to give up tnelr cherished but
exhausting "wooden willies," "eagles,"
"choo choos" and 'stretching." An were
cruel forma df iiazirg when carried to ex
cess, and the student movement was In
tenaeo. to reieeate them, to the past.
Fighting and bracing were retained, be
cause they are considered part of the
vital education of a soldier.
â¢ Ever}- wenk that has ever been con
ceived by any fun-loving set of young
men has probably been tried on the past
and future generals of Uncle Sam's army
during their "plebe" encampment at West
Point. What army officer has not per
forcied one hundred "eagles" in the shad
ow of the walls of old Forts Clinton or
Putnam? "Kagling" is the raising and
lowering of the body while resting on the
toes by bending the Ieg6 at the knee Joint.
It is accompanied by a motion of the
arms. Upper class cadets who have been
Â»een by tne tactful officer whlle~they were
putting a "plebe" through "eagling" have
been court-martialed and dismissed.
"Wooden willies" are continuous gun
drills. The name has been handed down
from class to class since* the regime of
an unpopular superintendent at the acad
emy, who was persistent about the pre
cision with which the gun should be hand
led at drill and dress parade.
The "choo choos" bring the handsome
cadet flat on the ground. He doubles up
Into a crouching position and shambles
across the grass. In "stretching" a
"plebe" hangs from a support. His full
weiKht is on his arms: ,
"\\ eJ= T Point men, must be cleanly.
"Plebes" are frequently put through all
the rude forms of a Turkish bath. In
their hot tents on a warm summer day
they are sometimes wrapped in blankets
and heavy rain cqats. Then they are put
to bed till â¢ they have perspired freely.
Their own comrades line on both sides of
the crxnpany street. Buckets of water
are placed In their hands. Down the
ttrcrt runs the excited "plebe." The up
per class men urce him on. He runs the
paumlet of the bucket brigade and retires
to his ter.t for a "rub down" amid the
chef rs= of his hazers.
Former Cadet George Mason Lee, the
tson of General Fitzhugh Lee, is remem
bered for his part in a "plebe" bath. He
ie now n lieutenant In the army, but Is
fctlll remembered at the academy as
"Slam" Lee. The lieutenant's cadet name-

, Let , the -. superintendent . be -â¢ authorized to

cause each cadet to pledge himself on his
honor not to haze while a cadet and the
practice will cease.
"Should this be done? I personally thlruc
not. -I believe that when not carried
to a hurtful degree hazing, as it was
practiced at the Naval Academy when
I was there, taufjht many useful les
ions of patience, self-control and
obedience."
Rear Admiral Henry Erben. a graduate
of the United States naval academy at
Annapolis, In the class of 1S54, said:
"Only mischievous pranks are played at
the naval academy. When I was a naval
cadet they held mock court-martials and
sentenced chaps to certain ridiculous pun
ishments.- We often sÂ»ent fellows forward
to 'pay their footing" by eatlne two
chares of 'duff.' Even midshipmen would
of ten take - part in the Bport. and send
'Jacks' aloft, there to threaten to put
a rope on them unless they would prom
ise to treat the crowd.
"I remember one new cadet at the
academy whom we ordered to stand sen
try on the 'scuttle butt.' He was not to
allow any of the 500 men en board to take
two drinks of water from the 'scuttle
butt.' That cadet stood In full dress uni
,form. with his sword at his side, for sev
eral hours, while every one else had quiet
fun at his expense. ,On another occasion
a cadet spent a sleepless night because
he had been ordered by the upper class
men to answer the captain's bells.
"The sons of prominent men. get
the worst of hazing. They are generally
made to do extra duty at Annapolis. tWe
loved to 'rig' them. â¢ They were often put
on ridiculous posts, with orders not to
leave until relieved. The hazing lasted
for two or three weeks. I never saw any
fights. Cadets are young at the naval
academy, and Jhelr pranks are more boy
ish. I should say a chap named Booz'
would make a fit subject for hazing on
account of his name."
Rear Admiral Sampson, commandant
of the Boston navy yard, had this to say
about his cadet life:
"In my- experience at Annapolis â as a
student, in 1857. and as superintendent of
the academy from 18S6 until 1S90â there
was no.flagrant Instance of hazing. There
was no case like the recent one at We3t
Point. In 1S57, my freshman year, the
cadets practiced what was called 'nigger
fieaing. The significance of the term has
never been'culte clear to me.
"The custom was for upper class men to
catch a man asleep and set upon his hand
Bfcveral pieces of broom straw about an
Inch long and then set fire to them with
a\ candle. The straws would burn down
to the flesh," and then the freshman would
wake up .with a start and all the fellows
would have a good deal of fun over the
experiment. You see, that sort of thing
was perfectly harmless. Compared with
several kinds of pranks in colleges in re
cent years It could not well be called
'hazing.' I went through the experience
of 'nigger fleaing.*
"I think that hazing, as reported re
cently at West' Point and in several col
leges, is brutal. , Especially . the prac
tice of forcing a little man to fight a
big. man should be discouraged, al
though it it not much worps than
making, freshmen clean .tents and
black boots for old-r men. .
. "Of course, as long as the new man is
not maimed or injured In any way the
hazing practice does not become a mat
ter for public attention; and, I'll admit;
the cadets at West Point or at Annapolis
'mar set much wholesome enjoyment out
of It all. But there Is always the possi
bility of carrying the thins too far. and.
therefore, I don't mind statins that
I bclisve that all forms of hazinj
should be stopped."
Rear Admiral John O. "Walker, chairman
of the Isthmian Canal Commission, en
tered the naval academy in ISoO.
"Hazing at the naval academy was un
known -when I attended the course." hÂ«
said. "It Is true that I frequently toughs
classmates who had Insulted me or who
thought" themselves aggrieved, but thera
was no hazing in the Dense that tho word
Is now employed. After leaving the acad
emy. I was on several occasions sta
tioned there, and no instances of hazlnj
then came to my attention. It seem* to
me there ought to be no difficulty in
stopping this practice. The imposition.
of severe punishment would promptly
end it, and I believe It is the observanc*
of this policy which has prevented. h&z
lng from thriving at the naval academy.'
Captain Charles D. Sigsbee. who com
manded the Maine when sha was blovra
up In Havana Harbor, said:
"Haxlng Is a recent practice ana did no*
exist at the Naval Academy when I wa^s
there. The hnys were wont to 'devil each
other and 'devil' their officers, and fre
quently on board ship a S2-pound shot
would be sent rolllnz down the deck for
the purpose of havlnj? the officer In chare*

â¢â¢SomeUme- a cadet did not act a* po
litely as he should have done to his su
periors I recall that the Navy Depart
ment on one occasion directed the super
intendent of the Naval Academy to . invea
tl-rate a report that a Patrician Leagua
existed at the academy. After Inquiry In
to the matter the superintendent called
up 1 yoSSSter and asked him If he- werÂ«
president of the Patrician League.
" 'No sir.* was the reply.
" Then what i3 your position, sir?* -wnm
th .?.l"2 S?8S* High Sheriff, with tha
rank of Prince.' the cadet replied.
"Sometimes the cadets -would en
gage in fist fights, but there -was no
system which required a man of thÂ«
lower class to bs hazed.*'
Brigadier General C. H. Charlton, re
tired, who was In the class of 1354 at thÂ»
Military Academy, expressed the opinion
that hazing at West Point has never been,
as brutal as at colleses,
".Tnere has always been more or less
hazing at West Point." he said. "I recall
that the first time I saw General Wesley
Merritt he was 'marking time. The ca
dets who had ordered him to perform this
exercise were chaffing him and he was
giving them as good as they sent. 'Mark
ing time" was the only physical exercUa
the boys were compelled to undergo.
"Frequently at night their comforters
would be nulled from under them; a plebÂ«
would be reculred to wait upon his sen
ior, get water for him in the morning .and
I on one occasion, while going to get my
shoes blacked, was ordered by one of or
seniors to take his boot9 along. I obeyed
his order. There was fighting among the
boys, but it was not In the way of tnÂ«

theclass to battle with the representative
of another class. -
"In case "of insult, the boy Insulted
would challenge the man ho thought had
wronged him. and no matter what the
relative sizes of tho contestants, they
would be -allowed to settle their dis
' pute. In the hazing at tha academy lÂ»
my time the main idea of tho boys waÂ»
to make fun. If a boy fltd a mean tricx
he was ostracized, and that was the- ex

"The hazing usually occurred at night,

VERILT truth Is stranger than fic
tion, for It is doubtful if in the
weirdest romance a more daring
and ingenious Dick Turpin has
ever been portrayed than is the Spanish
bandit Norel. whom ne police have long
been trying to capture, and who Is now
eaid to be once more in his old haunts in
Algeria.
One day last June Norel.. who was then
in Algeria, quarreled with one of his
countrymen named Linares, and promptly
assassinated him. The police were quickly
on his track, but he easily evaded them,
and nothing was heard of him until Aug
ust SI. wLen he appeared at llarengo.
Again the police "came on him and again
he escaped, after severely wounding two
of his opponents. Soon afterward he was
seen at Cherchell and at Oran. and each
time notice was sent to the authorities,
as he is an outlaw on whose head a price
has been set, but though they tried hard
to capture him their efforts were fruitless.
He next appeared at Alicante, having
cone there for the purpose of getting some
money from, /his brother, whose home is
in that town. When he told why he had
come his brother refused to give him any
money, whereupon the bandit beat him al
most to death and then ransacked his
house of all its valuables.
Norel has already assassinated seven
teen persons and has been condemned to
death on; three occasions. He escaped
from prison -some time ago in- very clever
fashion. First he murdered Â¦ the 'sentinel
who was on guaid near his -cell.' Then he
burned the dead man's face so that no one
would recognise it. and. finally, h* put his
own clothes on his vlctlnVs body and
dressed -himself in. the military; uniform.
When the body was ' found e\'erybody felt
sure that It. was Norel's, and when . the
sentinel did not appear at the midday
meal some of his companions remembered
that they had seen a soldier very, like him
hurrying away from the prison. an hour
or. two before, and they concluded that he
had deserted. Yet this soldier ' was no
other than Norel. Â» ,
On : another occasion the bandit, after
being condemned to death in. Spain, was
placed, according to the usual. custom, in
the prison chapel during . the evening be
fore the execution, and when night came
he expressed a desire to see a priest. His
request was granted, and when the priest
came Norel went with him Into a dark
corner of the chapel, with the avowed ob
ject of making, a confession.
As the priest, however, bent down to
hear him the assassin snatched from; his
hands the heavy-crucifix, and raising It
in the air brought It down with such force
on his skull that the unfortunate man was
felled lifeless to the ground. â¢ The soldiers
on guard heard the oody fall, but they
paid no attention to it,* and /when a man
wearing the vestments of a priest came
toward them from the gloom and,' after
blessing them, passed through the ' heavy
gate of "the : prison they never, suspected
that it was the notorious'; murderer; who
had thus once more escaped the clutches 1
of the law.".

HIS PRESENCE OF MINDâ The Mon
tana Club entertained him grandly aÂ£ter
the lecture* and he met many old friends
and acquaintances. Some of them h'ad
come all the way from Virginia City to
ee$ their former comrade of the mining
camps. One man, now. very rich, came
from Virginia City, Nev., on purpose to
see Mark and fettle an old score. When
the glasses were tilled and Mark's health
proposed this man' interrupted the pro
ceedings by" saying: Â¦Â¦Â¦'....-.- ' 1 ' . .;
"Hold on a minute! Before we go fur

that you did me a d d dirty trick over
there in Silver City and I've come here to

a minute a yell fairly shook the theater.'
Mr. Beecher signaled me to proceed.

He stood unmoved and waited ' fo'r -some
time. Finally a lull came and he began.
It was not many minutes before the
audience was. In full sympatny with thei

As he began reading his lecture the au

that seemed to affect the' audience more
than anything that could possibly have
occurred. A few minutes later he took
a piece of manuscript in his. hand and,
turning around with it. laid it on a sidÂ«
table. He probably had been speaking
about fifteen minutes. The audience

iaid he, "give me the first line from any

EMMA ABBOTT.
HER THIRST FOR NOTORIETY.â Mr.
Beecher's lecture was about half through
jvhen something happened. The attention
)f the audience was attracted to the front
if the house. All of a sudden there came
talking down the center aisle Miss Emma
Abbott in her Juliet make-up and wig,

Walking down to the orchestra rail she
turned and walked, in front of the au-

of the stage and which she might easUj
have reached by the side aisle without oln
servation.' .--:" . -. ' . '
After the great 'wave', of Interruption

his lecture to the endi when Miss Abbott
.leaped from the box ami rushed to' Mr.
Beecher, in whose church In Brooklyn sh2
had formerly sung, exclaiming:
"Dear Mr. Beecner. how do you do?
You must excuse my Juliet makeup ami

HIS VIGILANCE FOR "NO." 1."â It
seemed almost impossible to come to any
-kind of understanding with Zangwill. He
. thought that -there vfas a great public '
waiting- for him over here, and I also
thought so to a considerable extent. But
he -couldn't". understand i why he should
come over to America and draw great'
crowds and I get a third of the profits
from his earnings, so nothing was defl-i

Brattleboro, Vt., Sept. 30, 1S95. â Dear,
Mr. Pond: I am much obliged to
you^for your letter, but! can't say that
I can see my way to the ententement you
propose. There is such a thing as paying
125 cents for a dollar, and though I sup
pose there is money in the lecturing busi
ness it seems to me that the, bother, the
fuss, the being at everybody's beck and
call, the night journeys, and so on. make
It very dear. I've seen a few men who
lived through the light, 'but they did not
look happy. I might do it us soon as I
had two mortgages on my house, a l!en ;
on the horses and a bill of sale on the
furniture, and writer's cramp in both
hands, but at present I'm busy and con

ing the craft. No other sign of man was
seen on the ship. The man at the wheel
was hailed, but returned no answer â Just
stood there grasping the spokes of the
wheel and looking straight ahead. A boat
was lowered and the mysterious ship
boarded. When they came close to the
man at the wheel they saw with horror
that he was dead, and ha'd evidently been
dead for many daya. The ship, which
was named tha General Siglin, had sailed
from San Francisco for Alaska. She had
clearly been dismantled In a gale and
then abandoned by her crew. The cap
tain had refused to leave the ship, and,
finding his strength falling, he had .lashed
himself to the wheel and literally died at
his post, steering his craft - for hundreds
of miles -with hands that held the wheel
in as firm a grip as when alive. ' Â¦
Since the plague has been prevalent in
India searching parties go through â¢ the
villages inspecting the ' houses with the
Idea of seeing that all cases of death by
the plague are reported to the authorities.
On entering a suspected house" ' on day
the inspectors saw a group of natives
playing cards. Something In the appear
ance of one of the players attracted the
attention, of one of . the inspectors, .who
placed his hand upon the man's shoulder. '
To his amazement,' the man swayed 'and
fell to the floor. Upon examination, it was
found . that he had been dead ' some time,
but in order to avoid , having ; theTRouse
marked as plague stricken, the ; other, in
mates had concealed tho fact of his death
Hearing that the Inspecting party .was
approaching, they ' bad hastily, placed the
body in a chair and put some cards in th.Â»
dead hands. â¢ Then - they -; had gathered
abo.ut him j as , if. both_the .Quick and* the
dead were engaged in a game of cards.
Qu^r- Th?nSs *he Dead :DÂ©ne
T7 IVE persons have feigned death
1 1 with marvelous exactness, but
jl y when the dead feign life, or seem
to feign life, the spectacle is as
gruesome as can well be imagined.
Not long ago a Russian cemetery ' was*
the ecene of as weird a wedding as ever
has been witnessed^ A young girl who
had been betrothed died on the eve of
her marriage, and bÂ«r friends decided
that, in spite of the intervening hand of
death, her marriage must take place. The
wedding ceremony was performed at tho
elde of the grave, and after the marriage
the body was returned to the coffin and
lowered to its long resting place.
It is less than a year ago that a valu
able cup was won in a bicycle race in
Australia by a man who was dead when
he passed the winning post. The race took
place at an "electric light carnival," so
called, in the presence of 10,000 spectators.
In the last lap James Soxnervillc. a rider,
forged to the front and 6ecured such a
lead that his victory was assured. Wh*n
within twenty-five yards of the finish he
was seen to relax bis hold on the handle
bars and lose his footing on the pedals.
He did not fall from the machine, how
ever, and amid frantic cheers dashed by
the goal, winning tbe race by half a.
wheel. As he passed the finishing post he
pitched forward and fell to the ground.
When he was picked up he was found to
be dead, and, what was more, the doctors
declared that death had come to him
when he was seen to lose his hold of tba
handlebars- It was a dead body that had
ridden the last twenty-nve yards of tho
race.

don Standard,
me a candle ana conducted me to a room In tne east
wing of that big building, far off from the kitchen.
I was alone, and Beared, itoo. The room was a large
one and I noticed that the locks on the door were of
the colonial sizeâ big, heavy, massiveâ and I found
that they were very rusty. ; . [The ceilings of that room
were perhaps nineteen feet high; no carpets; and the
furniture was that heavy old colonial mahogany. The
bedstead was great, heavy, massive and tall, and the
bed was a Southern feather bed: and. remember the
air was warm, Â¦ the atmosphere oppressive; another
storm threatening; it was midsummer.- I was restless
and could not;sleep, and the walls of this big room,
as the walls of the main hall, were frescoed and
painted in the most lavish and weird manner. I saw
the lightning flash. It was sheet lightning and. would
light up. the whole room; and when it flashed" the
room became' brilliant and I looked at and studied
the 'pictures on'the walla. . ., Â¦
It was long after midnight, for I heard the bell in
the tower* toll 'the midnight hour. I must have dozed
off>end I "was awakened by the sound of a crippled
j one walking, in Â¦; the' big corridor coming . closer and
closer; it seemed to me as though it walked' with a
crutch or a cane. I waited and at last it came to my
door. Words cannot express my fear; the door opened
with a creak and the queerest old woman you ever
saw of thought of 'entered. I ': was wide awake,
though I feigned sleep, and I saw her well; her hair
was as white-as-'the driven snow and she .wore a
crutch under her left arm and her eyes, looked "bril
liant" and piercing; .she had tied aroun'd her head an
old cotton bandana handkerchief; she wore liiisey
clothes, homespun, /of ' a grayish color trimjned â¢ in
black; she carried in her hand an Immense bunch of
keys.
She came directly across to my bedâ horrors -as
she came up closer I noticed that In herbelt she wore
a lor.g glittering knife. She looked at me. looked at
the knife (remember, 'please! that I was feigning
sleep at that time), she waved a candle in front of
my eyes â my God, can I ever describe my*- feelings
then? Many would have grown gray that night. . Af
ter a heavy sigh she placed back into the scabbard
her, knife, counted her rusty keys and left the "room
through another door.- I heard the door close. after
her; the sheet lightning was flashing all the time and.
I could see those horrible pictures on the walls." I heard
the door lock and listened to her crippled departure
as it resounded down another corridor until it died
at last'away. It was horribly warm that night: I
was in a feather bed and it was midsummer.. Do you
believe me when I say I didn't 'sleep one: wink that
night? ' And'oh," if ever any one" welcomed 'the dawn
of day I was that one.' â¢ At last Mr, Nellson called me,
but I : was awake. I dressed and pretended to take
breakfast with him, but oh!, that night of horror, j -Â¦,
. I arrived at "Newcastle,' Cr:-.ig County, Just before
sunset and I saw. my Uncle Cliff .and others playing
euchre under the locust- trees. -I dismounted and my
brother's negro took , Bess "away. I had performed
the services, but oh, how -faint' I felt- I told them
where! stayed' the ;night before and also my experi- -
ence, and can I ever forget the horror when Uncle
Cliff, an old man retired from business, threw up his
hands, knocked over the euchre table and spoiled the
game in .exclaiming "Why, - that' .was'. Mrs. Smiley: .
I knew, her well in her lifetime; .your description of
her is absolutely perfect; she . wore that kind of
clothes;, she was Â¦ crippled;] she wore. a crutch under'
her left arm, and -Smiley murdered: her.". Â¦- v ,
GAN I ever forget a lonesome riae on the pike
from Newcastle, Va., to Newport, Giles Coun
ty? About 2 o'clock p. m. my brother who was
..practicing law at Newcastle, discovered that
In the Smiley estate a deposition had to be taken at
Newport. It was a warm afternoon and the ; road
sandy and the route circuitous." I left Newcastle at
the appointed time; Gus, the negro, groomed and sad r
died the best horse. Nothing : particular happened
until after Ihadtopped the mountain and was grad
ually going down into what Is known as', the Sinking
Creek Valley, when suddenly a little black speck ap
peared on the horizon. Being a, Virginian and .know
ing of the -terrillc thunder storms in- that - locality I
became uneasy; : my horse, wet with foam,' became
dreadfully tired traveling on the hot day and -heavy
Eand. The clouds thickened and. we knew a < thunder
storm was fast approaching, for then the .'.heavens
thundered from pole to pole. We were on*th'e moun
tains â the Blue Ridge, a spur of the AUeghanies. The
rain fell first in large drops ; and afterward p'oured
down on us. The lightning flashed and in ; the saddle
I could see tree after tre-2 struck down by its "fierce
fire flames. My horse refused to budge and stood
etark still in the road. I never did see it rain so hard
before and believe I never shall again; the thunder's
muttering3.were terrific and the lightning flashes
appalling. When the storm passed over it was almost
twilight and Bess, my horse, agreed -to. go on. We
were then some fourteen miles from Newport,
County, and night was falling.
The Smiley plantation lay directly in sightâ the
only hope of shelter on that lonesome mountain road.
1 opened the gate and rode up to the queerest, oddest
and most celebrated plantation in Southwest Virginia.
I had. heard before a great deal of the Smiley planta
1 tlon and the traditions handed down from colonial
days with it. When a child I was afraid of Sinking
Creek and on the Smiley plantation what was known
as "Dead Man's* Hole."' I rode up to the , gate and
asked an elderly gentleman, Mr. Nellson, for shelter
for the night from another storm which was' threat
eningâand, by the way, Mr. . Neilson was a very,
"wealthy and a. very eccentric Scotchman. When no
one else would purchase the Smiley plantation and
estate Mr. Nellson, an old bachelor and a woman
hater, bought it, and it is the finest, largest and most
fertile plantation In all that part of Southwest Vir
ginia. Mr. Neilson , reluctantly* agreed, after telling,
him; my errand, to shelter me for, the night. sHe him
self put my horse. away. and I entered what Is known
as the "ghost castle" In that part of Virginia.
I cannot.. express my surprise, when I entered that
large, roomy, dilapidated house, large enough to ac
commodate the guests at almost any hotel In any city,
The old colonial halls were Immensely broad; the ceil
ings were some seventeen or eighteen feet high; there
% were no carpets; the floors .were -glazed and waxed.
At last Mr. Nellson came and we had supper In his'
kitchen. He cooked it and I think ate it.. After a
while Mr. Nellson -suggested that I retire. - He' gave
times, but he answered not. and I wan
dered around through the paths and perl
winkles, lost entirely. My imaginations , !
were then frightful beyond compare. A
young woman, Hortense Spiller, who had
been the organist at the old Presbyterian
church, had recently been drowned In oM
Catawbaw and she was burled in that old
graveyard. I knew her well in her life
time, and many times at church I had
heard her play sweet anthems, and it
seemed to me that I never heard sweet
ter music on that dilapidated and ami
quated church organ. I knew where sho
was buried. Directly I heard a voice
softly Eay: "Soft, you; soft, you." . I lis
tened and thought I saw two men carry
a body up one of the narrow winding
paths. I instinctively hid behind an old
praveyard vault and listened and
watched. The wind was blowing and thu
ivy and bell creepers were creaking. Af
ter a little while words cannot ex
press my dismay and surprise â I saw
coming toward me, wrapped in her burial
shroud, poor dead, drowned Hortense Spil
ler. She held out her hand and tried to
speak to me. I stood starlc still, trans
fixed as a monument. I saw her eyes
wide open, her face pallid, her figure
slim and trim In her winding sheet. It,
was the ghest or specter of Hortense. Tlie
cold, round moon shone lightly down. I
remember that I screamed: I remember
that she vanished. The next I knew I
heard Bill call. That night we didn't go
to the circus, and the spirit or ghost of
Hortense Spiller to this very day as she
appeared there in that old graveyard
"haunts me still."
OTCE blustery, windy winter evening
I found myself lost in the old Pres
_ byterian graveyard. It borders *.n
that quaint, queer little lown.
Fincastle, and can be seen from any
Ftr^et or lane in the little ham'el: It
base* over Fincastle like .a pail
end a warning to al! its inhrtir
tjmts that it is at last their net-
Ing r>l2cÂ«>. 1 was hemmed In by the
great big walls, with their clinging ivy
and Virginia lwll creepers on the one
hacd and on the other the bleak, blear
mountain *purs cf the Alleghaneys. The
o5d graveyard is carpeted with periwin
klesâpretty little blushinc. blue flowers
that always remind one of the dying anl
the dead. It seemed to me that perl
winkles were the companions of vaults
and tombstones and of the resting places
of the dead. That bleak winter evening
that I was there in the old Presbyterian
graveyard I was absolutely alone. I
could see white monuments and tomb
stones all around m<* â I was in that oil
churchyard by accident. I may sny. I
rpm^mber well that many times when I
was a child r'.ayinR with other children
on the wide yawning old town green I
looked up yonder at the old churchyard
when right was falling and was scare 1
at its sepulchral appearance and loneli
ness. The evening I was there alone I
was on my way with Bill, my darky, to
eee Van Amberg's circus. %Ve vaulted
the old limestone walls of the graveyard,
afraid that we would not pet to the cir
cus in time. I don't know how it hap
pened, but It did, notwithstanding every
thln- else to the contrary, that Bill anl
1 became separated. I called Bill several
alone io a place untenanted. throw the
one ball of yarn in and say slowly, "Who
winds my ball? who wind3 my ball?"
That evening I had picked my place; It
was old Mohler's carpenter shop. I called
Bob Flggert oat on the porch and told
him where I was going; he said it was a
capital place. It was gloomy, enough, I
?an assure you, for the tulip trees almost
covered that dreary, lonesome, ghostly,
graveyard old place. Mohler had been
dead only a few weeks; he was onÂ© of
those peculiar eccentric- characters who
was not in love with daylight and hÂ© only
worked In that old shop after the sun

Mohler .premises:* the old house was de
serted and I can't tell you In words how
lonesome it looked. I went softly up to
that little old carpenter shop; I threw my
ball of yarn in through a broken window

moment, holding in my hand the other
ball of yarn, and directly I aald, as mother
hadr taught me to say, "Who winds my
ball? who winds my ball?" LJka light

illuminated; I felt the hand of soma on*
pulling the string of yarn; I looked insida
and there I saw old Mohler; ha had thm

Letters were exchanged, between them as

gards her death as an almost Irreparable
loss to Christianity, she having- con
tributed more than any other monarch to
the triumph of Christian sentiments and
the moral virtues. The Pope Is said ' to

SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 26.-The officials of
this city were much exercised this morn

which showed plainly the entire length or
more than seven blocks of cement nlde

that the bloody foot belonged to a Chi

an accident while trying to learn how to
navigate a bicycle in the lats hours of tho
night.
This city boasts of a Chinese blcycl*
club. It is composed of the servants of
people who live away from the center of
the town. It Is a common sight to see a
dozen or more Mongols biking through tha
streets. Joe wanted to join the club and
tried to learn how to ride. At midnight
in the shadow of the Hotel Rafael, ho
mounted his wheel and started down the
drive. An electric light pole danced out
Into the middle of the street and butted
into him. Joe and the bike bit the dust.
Remounting, he succeeded in reaching
Sixth street, manufacturing snake tracks
as he went. At the railroad crossing he
collided with the danger signal and was
thrown to the ground. jÂ± a o j,j can cover

CA1SL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 2?.â Tho question
of apportionment has' simmered
down to Senatorial and Assembly
districts, and each Senator and
each Assemblyman is figuring how best
he. can flxjuj^ft district in which he Is a
sure winner. In consequence, the Repub
.llcan counties" are , much sought after and
the Democratic ones are very much like
political wall flowers, for every one Is
willing to let; them go to his neighbor,
j The objection of Senator Davis to the
addition of Tuolumne and the loss of
Mono has been recounted. The 'desire of
{-uchsinger to go it'alone with Solano Is
Hkely'to be nipped ln'the bud, and several
moro equally ambitious are doomed to dis
appointment, for the reason that while
Democratic counties may be politically
dead they 'Obstinately refuse to get off the
map. Â¦:,â¢..
There is a desire on the part of Monte
rey-and San Bentto to Join with San Luis
Obispo and form a Senatorial district in
defiance of CutteT's bill, which says that
Kern and San Luis Obispo' shall go to
gether, and Monterey, San Benito, Merced
and Stanislaus shall Hock 'by themselves.'
It is pleaded that-along the eastern boun
dary of San "Benito County runs a range
of mountains, that prohibits passage, and
all the sympathies of San Benito and
Monterey have consequently drifted south
ward to 'San Luis Obispo and Santa Bar
bara. .Across these mountains lie Stanis
laus and Merced, both counties given to
irrigation, while in San Benito and Monte
rey -the lumbermen and cattlemen pre
dominate. It is declared there Is no sim
ilarity of interests between the western
and the eastern ends of the Thirty-first
Senatorial District, as Cutter would have
It, with Monterey, San Benito. Stanislaus
and Merced, and that therefore search
should be made down the coast and west
of the mountain chain for what Is needed
to complete the district.
This would take San Luis Obispo from
Kern, which, under the Cutter bill, makes
them- the Thirty-second Senatorial Dis
trict; but Kern could then reach ud and
filch Kings County from the proposed
Twelfth District, which includes Kings,
Tulare, Inyo, Mono, Madera and Marl

said: "Dr. Bacon, the Council cteims the right

that I was rlad that I had voted for Fuselehr.
and chars-ed the Council with having misrep

"I am sorry that I have placed you in a bad

More Interesting were the Prussian Dlit
proceedings this, week. All the Agrarians,
Conservatives, part . of the . national Libe
rals and Centrists have almost openly
avowed their Intention, to fYeat the canal
bill dilatorily until after the imperial Gov
ernment has Introduced the new tariff
bill in the Reichstag, showing plainly the
proposed Increase in the cereal duties.
Baron von Zedlitz, the Agrarian and Con
servative leader; plainly set forth this
condition In a signed article In Der Tag.
The Vossische Zeitung to-day reports:
"Two can play at that game. If the Diet
does so. the Reichstag will also treat the
tariff bill dilatorily." ..
The situation to-day, however, improved
upon Count von Bulow's statements inlthe I
Diet, virtually -assuring the Agrarlans\of/i
increased duties. . '|
Official repbrts show that German war
ships continue pirate hunting at a dis
tance from Hongkong and Fuchau, and
henceforth several of them will do police
duty in the Gulf of Pechili- and- secure
harbors at Shanhaikwan and Tsinwantao.
Â¦- Toe Mecklenburg Â¦ court has ordered
(three weeks mourning. . -
Tho Reichstag, whose attendance was
again minimal throughout the week,
found fault with Count Posadowski-
Wehner's regime as Secretary of the Inte
rior. This was specially the case with the
Socialists and members of the Freissln
nlge party, so that the Secretary's salary
has not yet been appropriated. The only
thing besides this accomplished was. the
debate on the pension bill for the China
forces, which the Government estimates
at 3.741.940 marks, the widow of a general
to receive 5000 marks against a private's
450 marks. The rest of the pensions are
proportionate, for an estimated one"-tenth
of the whole expeditionary force. While
initially there was great opposition to the
bill, even upon the part of Conservatives,
owing to the fact that Invalids of the
wars of 1864. 1868 and - 1870-71 are largely
still unprovided for, this was before Von
Bulow's declarations that this would be
mended. The pension bill will now. surely
pass. . , . .
The press Just now is hushed and no
paper' blames Emperor William for his
evident desire to render all homage to his
grandmother's memory. The usual din
ners In honor of the blrthdav of Emperor
William (January ZT) have been postponed
to February 3, by his Majesty's special or
ders. This applies- to the- German diplo

The opinion .that the death of the Queen
was precipitated by Field Marshal Earl
Roberts' frank avowals regarding the
South African war is here generally held,
but small hope is indulged in that King
Edward's Influence will be exerted to
bring about peace on. terms leaving the
Boers their independence. Â»The general
opinion of King Edward Is divided.
Though a. few regard him as Germano

BERLIN, Jan. 26.â The death of Queen
"Victoria hes made a 'profound Impression
upon. the German j>ubllc mind,,overshad
owing for a time every other topic. The
newspapers and other periodicals without
exception have devoted an enormous
amount of space thereto, and also to her
successor and Anglo-Qferman relations.
Numerous reminlgcenses .of the Queen
have appeared. The Kreuz Zeltung re

A motion of Count LJnberg-Stirum, de
manding increased protection for agricul
ture, was adopted by 230 to 43 votes.-
Preceding the vote Dr. Barth, the Frels
singc leader, said that whoever agreed
with the motion favored, an increase of
the customs duties at the risk of no new
commercial treaties being secured with
other ni-'.ona, In. which the vital interests
of millions of working people, were in
volved. . ' . Â¦'.Â¦â¢Â¦
"Fully recognizing the present difficult
conditions o{ agriculture, and animated
by a desire to effectually improve it, the
Prussian Government has resolved to en
deavor to secure adequate protective
duties for agricultural products, and
therefore an increase of the present rates
sufficient to attain that end. The Gov
ernment is also anxious to expedite in
every way the introduction of a new
tariff bill." The announcement was greet
ed with loud cheers.
BERLIX, Jan. 26.â In tiie lower house of

and hundreds of cases ara In the hospital.

The careful -Kbtinctlon must be drawn
between socialism and Christian democ
racy. The first concerns Itself solely with
material possessions, always seeking to
establish perfect equality and a common
holding of goods. Christian democracy,
on the contrary, respects the principles of
divine law. and while seeking a material
amelioration has in view the spiritual
welfare of the people. Christian democ
racy, moreover, must not be confounded
with political democracy, for the first can
and ought to subsist, as does the church
itself, under the most varied and political
regimes. Christian democracy also- ought.
to respect the laws* of legitimate civil
authority. The appellation "Christian de
mocracy" theiefore contains nothing
which might offend any one. These di
vergences having now been Â¦ dispelled.
Catholics should continue to devote their
cares to social questions and the better
ment of the working classes. T,he Pope
encourages the zeal and action of those
Catholics who consecrate themselves to
this eminently useful work.
The encyclical eulofdzes the giving of
alms, which the socialists wrongly regard
as insulting tho poor. Alms, on the con
trary, serve to tighten the ties of social
charity. It matters little whether this ac
tion of Catholics in favor of the working
classes is called the social action of
Catholics or Christian democracy. The
essential point Is that Catholics must ad
together to preserve the community of ef
fort and sentiment. Idle, useless questions
ought therefore, never to be brought up
In the presn.or public assemblies. Catho
lics must act so as not to engage in dis
putes.
The Pontiff concludes with exhorting
Catholics to inspire themselves with these
principles and to inculcate them; They
must urge the- people and workmen to
shun everything invested with a seditious
or revolutionary character, respect the
rights of others, be respectful to their
masters and observe sobriety and re
ligious practices. Thus will social peace
again become flourishing throughout the
world. -
ROME, Jan. 25.â The Pope's encyclical
on socialism was issued to-day. It is
dated January IS. and says a distinction
must be carefully drawn between social
ism and the movement among Catholics
reviewed in his previous encyclicals on
the socialistic subject, and which was
celled Christian democracy.
The Pope commences with recalling his
two previous encyclicals on social ques
tions, and says the sequel of these en
cyclicals was that the Catholics devoted
all their activity to social works to help
the working classes. The Pontiff here re
views ail that has been done in this di
rectionâthe foundation of labor bureaus,
funds established for the benefit of the
rural classes and workingmen's associa
tions of all kinds. He considers the ap
pellation "Christian socialism" incorrect,
and says Catholics who occupy them
selves with social questions are some
times also called "Chris uan democrats."
But even this title Is attacked by so/ne
people as being ill sounding. Divergerfces
have arisen therefrom, and the Pope ar
dently desires to eliminate them. , '

nADRID, Jan. 27.â The attempt
made Friday to shoot the Queen
Regent while she was out boat
intr with her children in a park
near the capital has caused con
siderable alarm. Diligent search has
been made by the police, but they have,
no clews to work upon beyond a bullet
hole In the gunwale of the boat In which
the royal family were rowing, and the
footprints of a man along the bank. No
arrests have yet been. made. .
The Government will probably ask Par

to the nation was Â£150,000.
Any one crediting the English with re
publican principles must be convinced that
the present demonstrations show the ab
solute unquestioning lovaJty of the whole
people to the monarch. Thousands of
columns of editorials in journals of every
political shade save a few Irish contain
no trace of dissatisfaction with Edward
Kcr, but only confidence and good wishes.
No monarch ever too* the crown moro
strongly supported.
The same good feeling toward Edward
VII pervades Kurope. only the Parisian
Â«nd a few Russian papers attack him. Ths
tributes to the dead vjueen have caused
sin era. of g-ood Zeetlng on the part of thA
Kngiish toward iho-ir sisier nations, how
ever brief. Kmyeror AVilliam's riliai con

bration oi the bw-er.ten.nial of the Prus
sian monarchy, have done mucx. to
etrt-ng-ihÂ«-n the Anglo-German alliance,
while the tribute of the Boer prisoners
tit Cape Town in giving up their sports

vtlmoctty of war.
The solemnity with which the English
people look on what sÂ«ms to American!?
to be queer ceremonieb ifc remarkable. Tho
proclamation at the Castle Edinburgh,
â¢where Walter Scott from, the window of
the Constable book ishop saw Georjre I
proclaimed, was no less brilliant than
the London paseant. Heralds and, pur
suivants ascended the battlements ani
the octapon turret. Around the tall shaft
were twathed royal purple. After tho
reading the castle guns saluted and. the
Scots sang "God Save the King." Tho
cf-rcmony was repeated at the gate of the
castle and at the Stuart Palace of Holy
rood, at the town boundary. The city offi
cials, the university professors and thrÂ»
local soldiery were in the procession,
which took place in a s:iowstcrm.

NEW YORK. Jan. 26.â Sir Martin Con
way,' an explorer rvho. has contributed
much to what is known" of the mountain
regions of ths world, is at the Fifth
avenue Hotel. ' having- recently Â¦ returned
from his third trip of exploration' to
South America, â¢ â¢ TV
Â¦ Sir Martin, whose explorations have ex
tended over a â¢ period of ten* years, and
who has devoted nearly , thirty. years to
scientiflo research, said last. night that
his work in South America would mark
the close of his career as an explorer.
He eald that he would maintain his inter
cst in scientific discovery, but that.in,thÂ«
future he would organize â¢ and send out
exploring expedition* Instead - of v going
himself- â¢ . -
Sir Martin said that he' was about -to
organize an^ expedition to go- to Peru
next spring to further, explore, the West
ern slopÂ© of tha Andes.. He..wllirsail for
England on "Wednesday next, and will
organize this expedition noon after he ar
rives in his native country.
"The eastern slope of the' Andes." Sir
Martin said, ""affords a field .for scientific
research which has Immense possibili
ties. Â¦â¢ Practically nothing is known about
the botany and nothing about the min
eral resources of tne vast region lying
to the east of the Andes. It is known,
of course, that v this -vast region has re
sources of Interest to science and of value
in a commercial sense, but it has been
so littlo explored as to leave the world
almost in the dark ' regarding its possi
bilities. Much is known about Venezuela
and Colombia, but as. yet little has been
learned about the interior of Brazil, Bo
livia, Ecuador. Peru and Argentina,"
Sir Martin, being asked whether his ex
plorations ln South America were prompt
ed by scientific objects, or. were for com
mercial purposes, "said:
"I. have been interested in the subject
from a scientific standpoint.. It Is im
mensely rich in mineralsâ how rich no
oni knows." ii â¢â¢
"Do you believe that American or Eng
lish capitalists may soon look to that
region as a promising field for : invest
ment?"
"Probably not at present," Sir Martin
replied. "Capitalists, are cautious, and
the mineral resources of the- region ar#
as' yet an undetermined quantity. There
can be no question, however, that the en
tire territory to the east of the Andes
is rich in minerals. Gold, silver, copper,
tin and other metals are there in vast
quantities â quantities so great as to make
that region in the future more productive
of precious metals than either the Trans
vaal or tho Klondike."
Andes Is More Productive Than,
the Transvaal: op- the Â¦';Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦' }
Klondike.

WELL ATTENDED HOP
h"-^"sfl NRAGED by . the refusal of his
divorced "wife to Â§Ign a deed
" transferring a piece of property
af the corner of Cortland and
Buena Vista avenues, Demas
Massonabe attempted to murder her in
her little notion and .tobacco .store at 400
Sixth street, near. Harrison, yesterday
morning. Massonabe' is now in jail,
charged with assault to commit murder,
and his former wife is at her home suffer
ing from wounds, none of them, however,
considered fatal. . . .'_.,..
Massonabe went to his former wife's
store about 10 o'clock and, . producing a
paper, said that Attorney Bergerot de
alred her to sign it. At the time of the
purchase of the property the' land was
mortgaged, but is about, to be sold. ' Mas
ponabe claims thai there is a balance of
$50 coming, and told his former, wife that
she could have this amount if she would
only sign the "paper. She said that there
Â¦was .some fraud,, in the. transaction and
would under no' circumstances affix her
signature. ' "â¢ . ' â¢
Her eldest daughter by -a former mar-:
riage. Kllze, Courreges. ajid her son, Jo
seph Courregea, 14 years old, were in the
store at the time.. ,
When' Mrs. Massonabe refused to sign
the document .her husband -became fu
rious. He whipped out his . pistol and
fired at his former wife, the bullet strik
ing her in the- arm. The womah. ran to
ward the rear, got into the kitchen and
locked the door. Massonabe tried to' force
the door, but was unable to do so.
Young Courreges "pluckily- ran , to his
mother's rescue and tackled his step
father. Massonabe .shook the boy off and,
firing a shot, at him, rushed to the rear
of the house. . Here he reloaded his re
.volver, and then smashing in a window
gained entrance to the room where the
frightened woman was crouching in a cor
ner. Two shots found a lodging place in
her body and others went wild, eight
shots in all being fired by the murderous
Frenchman.
Young Courreges, who had followed his
stepfather, again attacked him vigorous
ly, but as? he was not armed he could not
accomplish much. .
A crowd was quickly attracted by the
noise, and Eugene T. Sutton.a machinist.,
living upstairs, arming himself with a re
volver, went down to give the Irate man
battle. Massonabe was coming out of the
kitchen, when Sut ton covered him. As
the would-be murderer raised his weapon
to fire at Sutton young Oourreges struck
it from his, hand, the, pistol broke In two
and '.the cartridges dropped out. Sutton
closed in on Massonabe. and with the as
sistance of other bystanders soon.over
powered him. \
In the meanwhile the woman's daugh
ter telephoned for the police, but when
Officer's O'Nlell and Frances arrived with
the patrol wagon they found that his cap
tors had bound Massonabe hand and foot
with a quantity of -bale rope. He was
sullen ana ugly and cursed volubly in
French. Â¦ ' - Â¦Â¦
The Injured woman, her son and former
husband were hurried to the Recefving
Hospital, where Dr. Bunnell first treated
Mrs. Massonabe. One bullet had pene
trated the upper portion of the left arm,
another the right shoulder and r third en
tered the neck from the rear. The last is
the most dangerous wound. Probing
failed to find the bullet and.lt was neces
sary to resort to the X-ray process to lo
cate it. .This was done last night, and
after the -bullet was removed the woman
was taken to her home.
The gallant little lad who went so cour
ageously to the defense of his mother
was found to .be uninjured; although the
bullet tere away a part of his clothing.
He was sent to the Hall df Justice, where
he made a statement to Captain of De
tectives Seymour and Detectives Whltaker
anu â¢McMahoH. who -were detailed on the
case. His story differs only in detail from
the foregoing. â¢ â¢ Â¦"
It was found that in breaking through
the window .and In the subsequent strug
gle with Sutton and his captors, Masson
abe had been badly. tut about the head,
face and hands. There were two lacera
tions of the scalp, a contusion of the right
shoulder and an Incised wound of the lit
tle finger of the left hand. He was taken
to the Southern police station.- and. on the
Htatement "of Dr. Bunnell that his former
wife's injuries were not necessarily fatal
he was -charged- with- assault .to .commit
murder. He was removed to the Hall of
Justice later. '/-Â¦'Â¦'.:) :Â¦_ Â¦ : 3>->'#'
-Mrs. Massonabe claims the property in
dispute was community property. She
says that there was some irregularity
about the transfer and for that reason
she declined to slpn the papers for Mas
aonabe. P. A. Bergerot is the latter's at
torney
Massonabe, on account of his inability
to speak English and the lack of an in
terpreter, did not make a- statement. The
prisoner is 61 vears of age, has no occu
pation and is decidedly dissipated looking.
Mrs. Massonabe was separted from her
husband for nearly live years on account
ot his dissolute habits. She had several
children Â»>y a former huaband. lour ol
wnom are living, and two by Massonabe.
for whom she naa been able to make a
living in the little store conducted by her.
Frequently Massonabe has gone to her,
demanded and received money. He has
done nothing for the support of his chil
dren since the uivorce some years ago,
Mrs. Massonabe is highly spoken of by
her neighbors.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â The House to
day made good progress with the bill tc
revise and 'codify the postal laws. Only
twenty-eight of the 221 pages remain tc
be disposed of. Efforts were persistently
made again to-day to load the bill down
with amendments to effect changes in the
existing postal laws. The pressure was
especially strong in favor of reclasslfying
certain classes of postofflce employes
but Loud, in ch-arge of the bill, fought
all of -them, explaining that such amend
ments were out of place on a codiflcatlor
bill and would, if adopted, be the means
of Its death In" the Senate. In this -way
every attempt to amend the bill was suc
cessfully resisted. ! ,5
When the House opened Chairmar
Southard of the Committee on Coin
age introduced a resolution making
the Hill bill for establishing the parity
between the' silver dollar and gold a spe
cial order in the House, with two days
for debate.. The resolution goes to the
Committee on Rules, which will determine
whether or not t~e measure is to be
brought to the front as a special order.
Before this is done the advocates of the
measure -will canvass the sentiments ol
Senators with a view. of assuring Speakei
Henderson that the consideration given
to the measure in the House will not be
fruitless. . *
The House to-day disagreed to the Sen
ate amendments to the legislative, execu
tive and . judicial appropriation bill and
agreed to the conference asked for by the
Senate. Messrs. Blneham of Pennsylva
nia. Hemenway ot Indiana and Livingston
of Georgia were appointed conferees on
the part of the House.-
The House then proceeded with the con
sideration of the bill to revise and codify
the postal laws, which was interrupted by
the consideration Of appropriation bills. .
An amendment offered by Latimer, to
provide that rvi star route should be let
to any one ntÂ«.- a- resident in-tne county
where the route, was located aroused a
great deal of opposition from the friends
of the bill, who argued that the Injection
of such a provision into a bill to codify ]
the postal laws would result in loading
the measure down, and- make its ultimate
defeat certain. The amendment was lost,
36 to 47. .
Tawney of Minnesota discussed the ad
visablllty of placing upon the bill as an'
amendment his bill for the reclassiflcation
of railroad mall clerks. Loud appealed
to Tawney not to offer the amendment
on the ground that if adopted it would
sound the death knell of the bill. If the
bill contained any. provision which can
not-pass the Senate by unanimous consent
It must fail. t 7> ' ' ''â¢ Â¦ '
Â¦ â¢ Tawney declined to ' be convinced, and
offered the amendment. It classifies rail
road mall clerks into ten classes,* with
salaries ranging from $800 to J1S00 per an
num The amendment was lost, 48 to 49.
After completing 193 -pages of the bill
the committee rose. * Â¦,
The â¢ remainder of the, day was . devoted
to 'eulogies, on the late Senator â¢ Gear Â¦ of
Iowa. The speakers were Messrs. Hedge.
Lacy. Hull. Grosvenor, Richardson, Steele
and Daliell. ' ;
At 5:05 p. m.. as a further mark of re
spect, the House adjourned.

AUSTIN. Tex.. Jan. 26.â A dispatch
from Rio Grande City. Tex., says an Im
mense deposit of an unknown substance
which closely resembles clay has been
discovered near Rio Grande City. Pieces
of the substance ignite quickly and give
out a strong flame, which burns for a re
markably long period. It Is claimed by
local scientists that .the substance is
either an unknown mineral or that it is
ordinary clay highly charged with natural

earthly deposit sis a fuel is inestimable,
as it covers many thousands of acres and
Is of great depth.
Lawyer Sues for Damages.
STOCKTON.' Jan. 2G.â A. H. Carpenter,
a local attorney, to-day filed a damage
suit for $10,000 against A- H. Ashley, Dis
trict Attorney of this county, alleging
that Ashley had libeled him by accusing
him of subornation of perjury during the
trial of Arthur Ennis, charged with hav
ing stolen a hog from the Sargent ranch.
John Stennett, a witness, went back on a
6worn statement he had made to the offi
cers before the trial. Mr. Ashley claimed
he did so at the Instigation of Carpenter,
attorney for the defendant. The District
Attorney ordered Stennett into custody at
once for. perjury, and he has since been
formally charged with that crime. Car
penter characterized the proceedings as
high-handed and for the purpose of preju
dicing the jury against the defendant, and
Ashley declared that he would have Car
penter before the grand' jury on the same
charge. ...s

p^rr^ HE police and Receiving Hospitul
I Officials are puzzled over the case
I of . a powerfully built man who
)l attempted to commit* suicide yes
terday morning by jumping from
the ferry-boat Piedmont on her-11'o'clock
trip from the Oakland Mole to this, city.
As the Piedmont passed Goat Island ,thÂ« .
man. who was on' the upper deck, was
eeen to Jump deliberately overboard. Tho
cry of "Man overboard!" was quickly
raised and the Piedmont was stopped and
a boat was lowered. The would-be suicide
was making a slight effort to keep afloat
and when he saw iho boat nearing him
he swam toward it and was pulled over
the side and taken back to the ferry-boat.
On reaching the ferry slip on this sfdi
the man was taken to the Harbor Hos
pital, where he was treated for submer
sion and alcoholism, and later onwas sent
to the Receiving Hospital at the City
Hall. ; Â¦
All efforts to secure a definite statement
from the man proved futile. He claimed
that his home was in Cincinnati, Ohip,
and that his name was John Johnson.
When asked how long he. had been on
the Pacific Coast he answered sir months.
He claimed that he had traveled fram
point to point and was In Portland. Or.,
eight days ago. He denied that he had
jumped from the ferry-boat and insisted
that he had fallen overboard. An exam
ination of "Johnson's" hands showed that
they were soft and unlike those of a la
boring man, which he claimed to be. When
this was pointed out to him he said h-i
had not done any Work for some'monthy.
When asked how he managed to 'travel
around without working he refused to an
swer. â¢
Captain of Detectives Seymour -was no
tified of the case and in the afternoon
sent Detectives Wren and Dlnan to seo
"Johnson." but he remained dumb to all
their inquiries. Â¦ â¢ â¢ : .
Somo of the passengers on the train
from Stockton, on which "Johnson" trav
eled, stated that he attempted twice to
jump from the train and a brakeman was
obliged to keep a close watch on him until
ALABAMA BANK

made, were temporarily refused by its cor
respondents, though they were alfterward

apprehension, and It was thought best by

GOLD AND SILVER
ON A PARITY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â National lrri
pation was discussed in the Senate for
three hours to-day, the text feeing an
amendment to the Indian appropriation
bill, providing for surveys, looking to the
construction of an irrigation dam and
ditches for the watering of the reserva
tion of the Pima and Maricopa Indians at
San Carlos, on the Gila River. Arizona.
Durins the day the report of the confer
ence committee on the army reorganiza
tion bill was reported and Hawley an
nounced that he would call it up on Mon
day.
The first business In the Senate was the
presentation of the credentials of Fred T.
l>ubo:s as Senator-elect from Idaho and
of Shelby M. Cuilom as Senator-elect
from Illinois, the presentation being made
in Dubols' case by Heitfeld and in Cui
lom's case by Mason.
The desk of the Illinois Senator was
covered with flowers, and upon his ap
pearance, the rirst since his re-election,
he was cordiaJly greeted by his associates
on the floor.
llo<tr of Massachusetts Introduced and
the btnate passed a resolution asking ivr
Information at the command of tnc iTesi
dent or any executive oiticer of thtr Gov
ernment as to the extent of lands in the
l'hifippine Islanus held lor ecclesiastical
purposes, the character and value of such
tanas and whether any official had. on
behaJf of the Government, entered into
any obligation as to the titles ot such
lands.
The Senate bill providing American reg
ister lor the foreign-built oarKvntine J. Â«_.
l'lluger ot San Francisco was parsed.
liawiey made an effort to secure con-
Fideration of the conference report on the
â¢ rmy reorganization bill, stating at the
tame time that the bill could not be sup
1'lied to Senators until clerical errors in
the print received could be corrected. Oo
jection was made and the consideration
of the report was postponed until Monday.
The Indian appropriation bill was then
taken u;Â».
The amendment concerning townsite ap
praisements was considered, Pettigrew re
newing his opposirion to the Townsite
Commission. Alter some debate the town
eite amendment was agreed to.
IMatt of Connecticut opposed the appro- I
Dilation of $100,000 for investigation and j
frurvey of proposed irrigation dams and I
canal* on the <Jila River in the San Carlos
reservation in Arizona. He said he was
opposed to the plan, as it was one which
would commit the Government to a new
policy, which would be one of immense
cost "before it was carried out. Platt ex
plained that settlers at the head of the
Oila River had taken up water rights at
the head of the stream and thus cut down
the supply. The amendment, he said, was
framed in reality to commit the Govern
ment to a policy of national irrigation.
He contended that all the irrigation need
ed for the Indians couid be fecured for
SlOOjOOO. but that the irrigation advocates
favored this scheme because it would
foist the burden of irrigation of the arid
lands inevitably upon the Government.
Stewart contended that the amendment
contemplated only the completion of the
purveys already under way. and that
nothing would follow but a submission of
the complete plan to Congress. He then
made a general argument favoring irriga
tion of the arid lands.
Quarles of Wisconsin discussed the gen
eral Irrigation proposition, indorsing it,
but deploring what he called the guerrilla
Tactics which attempted to st-cure legis
lation upon appropriation bills rather than
by bringing forward a bill contemplating
the whole scheme of watering the arid re
gions. He said that what he opposed was
the method and not the scheme. He said
the Ftates and nation must act in har
mony to preserve water rights, and ac
tion must be taken quickly to secure all
rights for the people.
Thurston. chairman of the Indian Com
mittee, resented the imputation that the
committee was moving by indirection or
â¢was endeavoring to secure by fair means
any advantage to the irrigation advocates.
Thurston went over the legal phases of
the storage of water by such a dam as is
proposed. Then, taking up the general
features, he 6aid the site for the proposed
dam was the ratist favorable that might
Vie chosen for an Irrigation experiment.
He protested that there was always ob
jection when a email appropriation was
asked for the West, while Western men
were ready to vote for coast improve
ments.
Chandler caustically replied to the stric
tures on New England by Thurston.
Chandler reviewed the history of Irriga
tion legislation, and said he favored a
comprehensive plan of irrigation and
hoped some such scheme would be re
ported.
Thurston. referring to the East, said
toops Eeemed to gTOTf no longer on the
houses, but upon eonae of the citizens.
Against this expression Platt (Connecti
cut) put "nlmseif on record as against any
classification of the East as against the
W>ft or any other section. He ha.d al
ways, he paid, endeavored to faithfully
represent the entire country, and he was
favorable to an irrigation scheme when
carefully prepared. He asserted that there
was a lobby in the Interest of irrigation,
and declared that the feeling had been
worked up without any reference to the
cost of the work.
Amendments were agreed to appropriat
ing $11,000 for light, heat and water sup
plies at Klamath Agency. Oregon: per
mitting the Secretary of the Interior to
r-xpend not more than JIjO.000 for the pur
chase of water rights for the Southern
i;t"5; appropriating $25,000 for the purpose
of Investigating the mineral character of
lands in Indian reservations, snd to hold
from such reservations euch mineral
lardp; providing for an Investigation as
to whether or not a personal tax may be
levied In Indian Territory to maintain a
free school svstem: permitting the sale of
20.000.u00 feet of timber from the Jicarillo
Apache Indian reservation.
After a brief executive session the Sen
ate at 6:22 p. m. adjourned, with the irri
gation amendment etill pending.

IRRIGATION BILL
BEFORE SENATE
WASHINGTON. Jan. 26.â That Senators
regard seriously the prospect of an extra
session of Congress in view of the Presi
dent's urgent recommendation of legisla
tion concerning the Philippine Islands was
shown to-day by the activity of those who
desire to avoid an extra session. The
speculation concerning the probability of
a called session was rendered more defl
.nite by the fact that Senators known to
be generally well Informed concerning the
President's" plans joined in the discussion
of the outlook. ' Â¦
Careful inquiry also developed the fact
that the President had canvassed the sub
ject with a few Senators. He does not
appear to have indicated any fixed deter
mination of is-suing a call, but rather to
have consulted them as to the advisability
of *uch a proceeding. * In all such In
stances he seems to have had the neces-
at Philippine legislation in view, and
Senators generally express the opinion
that In case a meeting is called, the
Philippine question will receive the lion's
share of attention. The urgency of the
administration oh this point is due to the
importuning of the Taft Commission, the
members of which appear to have supple
mented their otticial recommendations for
earlv action with private letters not only
to the President, but to the members of
the Cabinet as well.
They insist upon the early recognition
of the civil rights of the Filipinos and a
government for them other than military
in form. Senators who have concerned
themselves with these matters have can
vassed the JSenate somewtiat to-day as to
the possibility of getting legislation be
fore March 4 in the line of that contem
plated by the Spooner bill; but they have
received very iittle encouragement.- One
Senator, who has given much atten
tion to the Philippine question, said that
any legislation attempted on the subject
of government for the Philippines neces
sarily would cause prolonged debate.
"The Senate .would talk a month on a
resolution -declaring that the Philippines
are the Philippines," said one Senator as
an illustration of his idea of the hopeless
ness of securing action before the conclu
sion of the present session.
Senators are divided upon the qupstjnn
of the necessity of Congressional action
upon the Cuban constitution. Some of
them contend tha*. Congress will not be
called upon to act in any way upon the
constitution. Others admit the correct
ness of the view to the extent of saying
that Congressional action will not be com
pulsory, but they advance the idea that
the President will-desire to have Congress
share the responsibility of whatever step
may be taken with reference to the Cuban
Government. They also suggest the pos
sibility that something in the Cuban con
stitution may require close scrutiny, and
they agree that if Congressional action
should prove to be necessary it- would not
be fair to the Cubans to postpone it until
"next December. The Senators who op
pose the ship subsidy bill are opposed to
an extra session arid will do all they can
i to prevent the calling of one. T'pon the
I whole, the most that can be said is that
both the Executive and Congress are dis
cussing the wisdom of an extra session
and that no conclusion. has been reached
on the point.
Hopelessness of Definite Action Re
garding Philippines at This
Session Is Admitted
by All.

of a- leader of a people, under whatever form of government, is an event which impresses; the
thoughtful world. We do not mingle with it any preference for, British institutions, nor hold it
as abating our fondness for our own. The Americans are a people of good heart ja.nd good mari

spirit the American press has; uttered the sentiments of the people., We have no grudges to nurse,
no ill will to Express, no unkindly feeling to be voiced. '..-.;â¢ [j ; * *â¢

It would be regarded with .wonder .in this country if any foreign people retaliated upon

That the French Government is unaffected by the- attitude 'of .the Paris press is shQwn by
the promptness of the President and Cabinet in the tender of official condolence.
As the Government "has done its manners," it is probable that but little attention will.be
paid to the discourtesies of the press.; r
It is probable that we must look more to commercial: rivalry than to political sentiment

nals proposed to snub the Paris Exposition on account of the .Dreyfus' affair. That resentment
was natural, whether wise or not. -The Dreyfus affair was a peculiarly domestic concern of France,

St. Helena should have been forgotten in the incidents of the second empire.
It is somewhat. difficult to account for the recent anti-British feeling in France. The mem

in the later attitude of England toward certain representatives of the, French people..
Louis Napoleon found an asylum jn England after his Strasbourg fiasco, and again, when
the fabric of empire crumbled at Sedan, he and his family had a royal refuge at Chiselhurst and re

WITH few exceptions the Paris press has been very rabid and radical in its open and covert
attacks upon the late Queen of England while she was dying, arid after she was dead.
Of course it is the height of folly for any one to consider the death, from natural
causes, of a person past four score as. a special Judgment for errors in government policy. [Yet
the Paris press has been capable of just that folly.

From San Joseâ Mrs. E. Carson, Miss

He has made an issue that cannot be ignored, nor put down. It must be met, and pocket
picking must not be introduced into this city by official action or the Mayor's- favor. ' Enough
hearts have ached, enough /youth, have gone wrong, enough tables have lacked food and hearths
have. lacked fire, by that pocket-picking which the Mayor favors. It must be no more;
When this is put alongside of his denunciatidn of this public gambling, in which he in
dulged a year ago, it is plain that this city must protect its morality without the help of the
Mayor, who favors the crowd that he declares rs "engaged in pocket-picking." His attitude pre
cipitates a crisis. His belief that the people of this city need track gambling "simply as a dissi
pation'.'is not shared by the business men and decent, folk of San Francisco. These must not
sleep on their rights. These declarations of the Mayor must be met by an aroused public opinion.
The people must mount guard and stay tinder arms until the Mayor's purpose to introduce
pocket-picking as a dissipation has been defeated and forever, overthrown.
in the three countie
He declares that picking pockets by the gamblers is so good a thing that it should
be passed 'around, and envies Oakland, where it is permitted! Why not declare for an open sea
son for murder or any ether form of crime as well as pocket-picking? Again' he declared in the
same interview that he favored track gambling for an equal number of days in San Francisco,
Oakland and San Mateo, saying: "This would give the gamblers an equal number of days in each
city and an equal opportunity to pick the pockets of the same public, for the public is the same
"I do not believe that we should give the gamblers of Oakland an opportunity for, an ex
clusive privilege to pick pockets simply because we have a moral crusade on in this city. I believe
we ought to permit this racing season of thirty days simply as a dissipation for our people. I
would therefore approve an ordinance for a limited racing season." Â¦ Â¦ .
His language is so at war with everything that is expected of a man in his position, that to
have uttered it is to forfeit the respect of all decent men and women. Ponder for a moment this
language from the- Mayor of San Francisco :
In view of the horrors' it has caused, the hearts it has broken, the lives it has ruined, the in
nocence it has transformed into guilt, Â¦ we 'know of nothing more disquieting, more disgraceful to
this city and its people. than the declaration made by Mayor Phelan. If he had lived in Babylon
when the annual tribute of maidens was exacted, or in the Rome of Nero, or in the Paris of Louis
XIV, he could not have shown a heart more callous to all moral considerations than' he exhibits
in his advocacy of an open season for vice in this city.
Business men, social organizations, the pulpit and the press have joined in exposure of the
evil and deprecation of its existence. Judges from the bench have delivered homilies against it,
as they have passed the judgment of the .law upon moral wrecks that have, lost character and lib
erty as a result of its seductions'. It has been the fecund parent of every crime, from taking away
virtue to taking away life. No one pretends to defend it on any .ground that deserves respect.
The people fear it as they do the physical pestilence that walketh in darkness. ' They have a right
to the sympathy and the effort of public officers, their servants, in it's suppression, as they have a
right to the effort of the same officers in curbino/an epidemic, keeping public order and protecting
life and property. Indeed, they have a higher right to such sen-ice against this sodden and repul
sive parent of sin. Epidemics end life, and fires lay property waste; and thieves break through and
steal, but the injury and sorrow of these are without stain and without disgrace. The gambling on
the track takes life and property, 1 and smuts their loss with turpitude, disgrace and degradation.
NO LOCAL question has more greatly affected the reputation of California, to its injury, than
track gambling. Perhaps, no city in the Union has suffered more severely from this form
of. vice than San Francisco. Its victims have been found in both sexes and. in every class
and kind of society. Employers have been robbed of their money, mothers of their hope,
children of their bread and many of their lives by this; appalling vice. ,
THE- MAYOR'S MORALITY.
"El Gran Galeoto" is a powerful and
tragic indictment of that tendency to
gossip and slander, whose humorous side
has been satirized by Moliero In "Le
Misanthrope." by Congreve In "The Way
of the World" and by Sheridan in "The
School for Scandal." This tendency is
one of the most primitive, the most deep
ly rooted and the mos^t detestable vices to
which humanity is heir; as such it is rec
ognized and as such it is prayed against
hebdomadally by' millions. -who, in the
eloquent words of "The Litany," do be

and hypocrisy; from. envy, hatred and
malice and all uncharitableness." . A

that has ever been heard of it. Yet the
last act of this playâ "El Gran Galeoto"
(the Great Go-Between)- is characterized
by a profound psychology and contains a
situation such as only a dramatic poet of
high rank could have conceived.

nominated for the Ministry and accepted,
but the immense success of "El Gran

prominent among them have given their
countenance to this latest absurdity,
each one of whom knows individu

Wagner according to Mr. Howe must be
a bathetic jest, a stupid paradox, a fatu

these musicians is the more comfortable
one, as they are ful'ly aware of the in
evitable fate of the "Wagner Society" be

cause of good music suffers, time, temper

The Schumann D minor piano trio, the
Mendelssohn "Canzcnetta" and Bach
"Aria " for strings, and Tschalkowsky's
"Souvenir de Florence." were the features
of the sixth and last concert of the
Minettl Quartet series.
The club was assisted by Otto Bendix,
C. Fuhrer and William Wertsch.
Mr. Bendix is nothing if not various.
He bore an admirable part in the Schu
mann trio, which came as a complete-sur
prise after his work at the last concert.
It was discreet, charmingly colored and
balanced, and in happy accord with the
spirit of the composer. The whole trio
was most enjoyable! The lovely Tschai
kowsky sextet .was given with a more cer
tain touch and familiar handling than on
its first hearing, but the' intonation was
by no means faultless. The thistledown
elegance of the Mendelssohn number and
the broad, grave movement of the Bach â
a happy contrastâ were both given with
happy efTPfct. The series of concerts will
probably be resumed next season, as lov

Is understood that a series of concerts un
der the same auspices will be held month
ly, and If the â¢ further programmes are
equal in interest to the initial effort of the
Twentieth Century Club in this direction
the patronage will be deservedly large.
The programme was an unusual and
ambitious affair, containing the "Lohen

Amneris" duet from "Aida," "Tannhau

Dances" of Brahms-Joachim. 'â¢ another

pleasing contralto voice, with lower tonea
of line quality, and a good dramatic in
stinct, gave the "Mignon" song of Lizst
with much grace of rendering, and with
Mr. Barrangon gave the "Aida".duet. Mr.
Barrang'on's principal number, laudly re
demanded, was the "Lohengrin's Tale."
The Elnger has a robust virile tenor, of
the true Wagnerian build, and as yet only
a hint and promise of what with further
cultivation it may become in the future.
Mr. Barrangon is evidently possessed of.
any amount of temperament, and his
voice and method, with added smoothness,
fineness and control, will doubtless be
heard from in no unworthy fashion.
Mr. Weiss' work is almost too well
known to need comment, and in the "-Cap
rice Hongroise" he was at his admirable
best. Harry Samuels played the Laub
"Polonaise" and the Brahms-Joachim
"Hungarian Dances" in effective fashion;
and the accompaniments were in the ca

gave a clever bravura rendering of the

I HAVE this week, received a circular \
concerning a projected "Wagner So
ciety" of San Francisco, which Is
distinctly unique alter Its fashion and
to which only the Justice of free

the 6oclety Is thug stated:
**To thoroughly study and present to th*
public the works of modern masters, es
pecially the works of Richard Wagner.
Tnere will be taken up works of Saint
Saens, Massenet, Tschalkowskl. Svend
een. GreSg. Glinka, Cut. JUmski-Korsa
koff and modern Ensilsh and American
composers.
"To study these -xorks theoretically,
practically and artistically, by absorbing
through the medium of lectures, essays
end discussions, in conjunction with con
certs, employing soloists, chorus and or
chestra. The concerts and lectures will,
with a few exceptions, be siven in tha
evening.
"Admission to any exercise of the Wac
rer Society Is not confined to citizens but
Is open to persons of other cities who ar?
able to attend regularly. These lectures,
combined with the rehearsals and con--
certs, form the most unlaue musical m- !
Ftitution of its kind and is strictly up tc
date.
"In this day the study of Bach. Han

fired to musicians; for men and women of i
the period feel it a necessity to under
stand the principles of Wagnerian art.

nrstâ It is unusual to split the infinitive. (

Of the president and conductor the cir

raphy, which epeaks for itself:
."The president and -conductor, who has
planned and worked out every detail for
tht> organization, of the Wagner Society,
was et an early age a student in the Bos
ton University, College of Music, in con
ducting under Carl Zerrahn (the veteran
oratorio conductor of Boston, for many
years "conductor of the Harvard Associa
tion symphony concerts and for over
thirty years conductor of the Boston
Handel and Haydn Oratorio Society).
Later be was a student of Georg Hen
echel's methods while Mr. Henschel was
conductor of the Boston Symphony Or
chestra, receiving- also a pass to the pri
vate rehearsals as an aid to his studies.
"Still later William Gerieke"s method,
was closely followed and that of Arthur
Kickish. both conductors of the Boston
Bymphony Orchestra. But the greatest
pleasure of all experienced by Mr. Howe
was while with Anton Seidl (who was for
a long time assistant of Richard Wagner
et Bayreuth, also making for him the
flirt copy of the score of the Nibelungen
tetrology) for seventy concerts and noting
carefully his Interpretation of Wegner's
works and .other modern creations, be
sides having access to his valuable library
of expensive scores.
"Since completing these studies -Mr.
Howe has directed many oratorio socie
ties and orchestras, one chorus being of
600 gingers and another of 1600, and now
enters upon this new work full of enthu
siasm. All he asks Is loyal support, that
he may be enabled to carry out his ideas
â¢ nd give the people the best music In an
acceptable manner."

One phase of the "loyal support" so
licited by the society is that of patients
who may present themselves for "private

acted regulating the hours of labor and

Entrance to the revenue offices, which
occupy an entire side of the second floor
of the Government building, was effected
through an oj>en transom. The robbers
bored through the vault door and tnto
the bar which turns the bolts into place.
Then, by the use of a hammer and chisel,
they broke the bar, which is on the in
side of the door. Afterward they took
the .bricks out at the side of the safe and
easily pried open the vault door.
The authorities claim that they will
have no idea of the value of the stamps
taken until after the concents of the safe
have been invoiced. It is possible that
the amount may reach $1,000,000 or more,
and it U equally possible that it may be
considerably smaller. This district pays
more internal revenue than any other
district in the country. t
Deputy Collector Marshall, who ts In
charge of the department during Collec

make any estimate whatever. Others con
nected with the department assert that
$H<0 <ioo will eover the Government's loss,
i'hief of Police Flynn says that Â» from
what his detectives have gathered he con-
Eiders that amount high.
Others besides the Government lost by

There Is scarcely a disease more aggra-

practice to use ointments, salves and
similar preparations containing dangerous
poisons to remove the trouble. The Pyra-

new remedy for that common aod obsti-

Under previous administrations several
employes were discharged because of this
variety of commercial dishonesty.
"There are between 300 and 350 employes
In the Custom-house, and while I do not
know tnat any are dishonest or unwilling
to pay, I have given the order for the In
formation of all whom it may concern."
"Custom-house employes must proceed
to' pay their just debts or they will be dis
charged from the service." says Port Col
lector Stratton. "Under the law their
wages may not be garnisheed and their
creditors have no guarantee except the
honesty of the debtor* There is no valid
reason, ordinarily, why a Federal official
should not pay his debts. . Of course, if
he lives beyond his means he cannot pay
them, but that Is rot a good excuse.- I
have Issued an order this morning that
unless an employe can show good cause
fpr falling to pay his debts. and that he
is making a tineere and honest effort
to do so he will be discharged.

Mrs. Isabel Wilson, .an octogenarian,
was the victim of a painful accident last
Friday afternoon.. . She had been para
lyzed on one side for the last seven years
and was incapable of helping herself. It
was the custom of two ladies living in
the house witTi her to wheel her in an
invalid's chair In front of the parlor
grate in her residence on Fifteenth, near
Point Lobos "avenue. Shortly after noon
on Friday they wheeled her into her ac
customed place, and -while busied with
.their household duties in another room
were attracted by a noise in the parlor.
They found the o!d lady's clothing In
flames and a pillow cushion also on fire
on the floor.
. Dr. Cleary of 330 Clement . street was
called in Rnd administered the usual rem
edies, but the old lady's physical condition
was" such that she could not rally from
the shock, and she died at 6 o'cloek In the
afternoon. '
Mrs. Wilson had been singularly unfort
unate. Her only dauRhter died about a
year aeo as a result of being kicked by
a*^ horse. The accident prostrated the
daughter for about three months with
spinal complaint, and just as she was
about convalescing she made a misstep
while descending the stairs and dislocated
the injured vertebrae, her death resulting
an hour afterward.
Another victim of- lire reported to the
Coroner yesterday was Mrs. Annie M. MU
lican,,51 years old. of 804 Taylor street.
She had been an invalid for twenty y^ars.
On January 13 she was reading in bed
by candlelight, and was burned about the
le^a by reason 'of â¢ the candle upsetting
while i she was in a. doze. She died from
the shock in St. Luke's Hospital at 4:30
o'clock yesterday.

eases, culminating In an acute attack of
the crip.
Colonel Granniss was- born In New Ha
ven, Conn., In 1S25, and was educated In
the public schools, later graduating from
the famous Hopkins Academy of Massa
chusetts. At the time when he was fin
ishing his scholastic training the world
was excited by the discoveries of gold *n
California, and- Colonel Gra'nnlss was one
of the many who braved the perils of the
long voyage around Cape Horn to reach
the new El Dorado. In 1850 he arrived at
j the Golden Gate and Joined the rush to
j the mines. He helped to dam the Amer
' lean River at Krasers Bar and endured
many hardships and exciting adventures.
At the close of 1851 Colonel Granniss left
the mines and embarked in business !n
Sacramento, shortly afterward coming to
San Francisco to enter Into- commercial
pursuits. In 1853 he accepted a position
as customs clerk in the Government em
ploy, having experienced many reverses
and successes while a member of the busi
ness community. Colonel Granniss made
many friends while In the service of. the
Government, and his merit was appre
ciated by the well-known firm of Hafleck.
Peachy & Billings, -which made Granniss
their chief clerk on his retiring from the
Customs Department. He established
himself firmly In the estimation of his
I employers and was intrusted with all
I their private affairs, and property inter
| ests on the Pacific Coast.. He remained
with the firm until all its lands were sold
and its business wound up.
Colonel Granniss was a prominent figure
In the National Guard of California. He
rose from the ranks through successive
grades to colonel of the First California
Regiment, being the first commanding
I officer who began his career as a private.
"When he assumed command of the regi
ment It was sadly lacking in uniforms
and arms. Colonel Granniss was most
eager to make* a record for his command,
and It was not long ere the organization
was smartly dressed and well equipped.
Colonel Granniss and his regiment played
an important part in the Kearny riots
in 1876.
He was Identified with . many public
movements and was a warm personal
friend of Major General Halleck, U. S. A.,
who made him executor of his large es
tate. Colonel Granniss w*us administrator
of the Halleck estate for many years and
erected the statue of General Halleck In
Golden Gate Park. - -; â¢
As the executor of the estate of Major
General Halleck Colonel Granniss became
the possessor of many confidential letters
which General Grant wrote to Halleck.
Among the letters was one descriptive of
the desperate fighting with Lee on the
advance to Richmond, In which Grant de
clared: "I will fight it out on this line
if It takes all summer." When this letter
was read by General Halleck to President
Lincoln the latter said: "Halleck we will
give that to the country." For many
years thereafter the popular impression
existed that the message was a laconic
dispatch from Grant to the adjutant gen
Â«s Â¦Â« Â« t .Â». Â» t.y..Â»..t-Â«..t..t..t_.Â«A
era!,., but It wan In fact a sentence of a
long letter, unofficial, to Halleck. About
four years ago Colonel Granniss gave the
original letter to th- Government, or sent
it to the Connecticut Historical Society.
The Halleck correspondence also con
tained letters written by Grant Just be
fore the Vicksburg campaign opened.
Inese letters were written at Oxford,
Miss., in November or December, 18G2.
Halleck was informed that Generals Me-
Clernand and Lew -Wallace were poli
ticians and would not be of much service
to the army in the campaign then im
pending. Grant spoke without reservation
In his private letters to General Halleck
and the subsequent publication of the cor
respondence cleared away much doubt as
to Grant's estimate' of his subordinate
officers.
Colonel Granniss made a prolonged visit
to Europe in the "seventies" and often
spoke of the kindness shown to him bv
the Prince of Wales. The colonel present
ed a distinguished military figure and re
ceived from army officers in Europe the
attention due his rank as an officer anl
his attainments as a citizen.
Colonel Granniss Â¦ was a well-known
member of the Bohemian Club and passed
many of his leisure hours at that institu
tion. He was an interesting talker and
was fond of relating his experiences in
Sacramento in 1850 when the cholera was
epidemic there. He was a zealous, out
spoken Union man when the danger camo
that California might cast he.r fortunes
with the South. He admired the loyal
stand taken by Thomas Starr King arid in
all public places proclaimed his unswerv
ing devotion to the administration of
President Lincoln.-
Colonel Granniss came of Revolutionary
stock. His father was one of the crew of
the General Armstrong, the famous Amer
ican privateer which fought the British
in the harbor of Fayal in the war of 1812.
That memorable battle of one ship against
a fleet is one of the greatest feats In
American naval history; When resistance
was In vain the ship was scuttled, but the
stars and stripes were not lowered. Some
years ago the King of Portugal returned
to the American Government one of the
guns of the Armstrong which had been
recovered by divers. .
Colonel Granniss was a married man
and had but one child, a daughter, who is
married to a prominent merchant In the
Orient.

eocainp <>r morphine habit as the results
from this catarrh cure are apparent from
the first day's use.
For emarrh of the nose, throat, bron-
chial tub<>s. for catarrh of stomach, in-
tf-stines or bladdor no preparation is so
t=afo and gives s<ich rapid" and permanent
rcfiilts as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
Catarrh is dimply- a continuation of
these symptoms until the trouble becomes
chronic and prows gradually worse from
year to year.
Stuart's U:;tarrh Tablets are composed
of Hydrasiln. Kucaiyptol. Guaiacol and
Fimil.ir antiseptics and catarrh specifics,
from which it will he Been that no secret
is mnde of th" ingredients and also that
no mineral pcifons arc used, as is the
cape with many well-known catarrh med-
icines.
A new remedy has recently appeared
Â¦which po far as ttvied seems to be re-
markably effective In promptly curing ca-
tarrh, wherever located. The preparation
Is soid by druspists penerally under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and in addi-
tion to lining very palatable and conveni-
ent, possesses extraordinary, merit, in
many rases pivinK immediate relief from
the coughfnjr. hawkins and constant
cloarlriK of t!~.e throat and head, those
eymptoms with whic'.i everyone is famil-
iar who has ever s-uITcred from colds In
the head and throat. â¢
It Is a common mistake to suppose that
catarrh is confined to the nose and throat.
Ally inflammation of the mucous mem-
brane wherever located accompanied by
abnormal secretions is catarrh. Catarrh
of stomach or bladder, or intestines is
nearly as common as nasal catarrh and
much more serious, although it is true
that j-tomach catarrh and catarrh of oth-
er Internal organs is the result of neg-
lected r.at-al catarrh.
There Is no disease so common in, the
United States as catarrh because it ap-
pears in so many forms and attacks so
xn;Â»ny different organs.

The several victims of the swindler held
a heart-to-heart talk and finally conclud

over the change she shoved part of the
money under her glove. ThÂ« schemV Is

asked a conductor employed on a line run
ning to the Townsend-street railroad de
pot. "Light colored hair, blue eyes, about
21 or 22 years of age? Wears a dark blue
skirt and automobile sacaue, eh?"
"Yes," answered the Market street rail
road man. "Have you met her?"
"I guess so." was the reply. "She cost
,me 60 cents Tuesday afternoon. Worked
tne same game on me. Important tele
gram; in hurry to catch San Jose train;
$o piece for fare; 60 cents short change
and off car at Harrison street."
"You fellows ain't alone." chimed in a
conductor from the Mission street line.
She owes me 40 cents. She was heading,
the day I met her, for a train at the Va-
A new style of petty swindling has been
Introduced here. The conductors em
ployed on the street cars have been the
victims. It was only yesterday that they
discovered ,that the game was being sys
tematically I worked.
The swindler is a well dressed young
woman, with a. suave and polished man
ner, when she boards a car the smallest
piece of money she has to offer in pay
ment for her fare is a Jo gold piece, when
she leaves the car she is generally from
40 to 60 cents ahead of the conductor. The
swindle coula have been worked indefi
nitely had it not been that one of her
victims made a remark yesterday that set
his listeners, who were also railroad men,
comparing. notes. Â«
When they told their several stories it
was evident to all of them that they had
met the swindler, but did not realize until
too late that, she was robbing them. The
exposure of the swindle came about In a
very simple way. - . - ; ,
"I had a rather peculiar experience last
night," said one of the men who is em
ployed as a conductor on the Market
street line. "We stopped at Grant avenue
to. allow a passenger to alight and I had
given the bell to the gripman to go ahead,
when a young woman ran out from i the
sidewalk signaling me. to stop the car.
She took a seat on the inside. When I
â¢went'to collect her fare she handed me a
$5 piece and anxiously asked if she would
be in time to catch the 8 o'clock boat. I
told her that she had five minutes to
spare. , - :
â¢' 'Have you no smaller change?* I
asked. ' V,
" 'No, sir,' she replied. 'I have Just re
ceived an Important telegram requiring
that I catch the 8 o'clock boat. I was
'afraid that I would miss it. Otherwise
I would have got change in some store
before getting on the car. I know that
it is inconvenient for you gentlemen to
change gold, but under the circumstances
I am compelled to impose upon your good
nature.' . â¢
â¢'She spoke pleasantly and: looked inno
cent. I never for a moment doubted her
honesty.- I gave. her, $4 95 in chanfre-^nick
els, dimes, quarters and halves. She took
the money in her left â¢ hand, which was
gloved. I went out to the. rear platform,
and had been there but a moment when
she beckoned to me. I. went inside.
" 'You have, made a mistake in the
change you gave me,' said she, looking
up in an innocent sort of way. 'twere is
only $4 55 here,' and she handed me back
the money. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦' . ' â¢ ".
"I counted :lt over and found that she
was right, so far, as the amount. she re
turned me was concerned. 'I was almost
certain that I had -given her the exact
chance but fearing that I might have
made a mistake I gave her 40 cents more.
I didn't want to question her honesty.
You know you don f t like to get into an
argument or dispute with women passen
ccrs. Â¦ Â¦
"When she reached First street she sig
naled me to stop the car; 'Pshaw, I must
lose that boat after all.' said ahft. when
she came out on the. platform. *I forgot
something and have to go back home.'
' tvlt A thus occurred to me that she had
acted In a rather strange way.
â¢'When I got to the- ferry landlnsr I
counted over my, chanpre and found that
I was exactly 40 cents short. I Just want
ed to kick myself. If. -I. had counted my
money when she said that I had given her
40'cents too little I would have' known
tharl had not made a mistake. But if
I had discovered that I was . not vv ronp,
what could I " do? I would rather, part
with- 40 -cents any. day > than get Into h
dinoute with a woman. '.
"What kind of a looking woman Is she?"

Mr. Loveland said that If the merchants
of New York, Chicago, St. Louis or Seat
tle, by reason of the volume of business
which they do with common carriers, can
influence the carriers to. give them th-3
same rate that San Francisco enjoys hov/
could the merchants of San Francisco pre
vent this? Or how. can they blame thq
transcontinental lines terminating In 8xn
Francisco from doing likewise? Continu
ing, he said:
."Naturally I should like to pee the ex
port business of Oriental ports done by
this city,- but in looking at it from thi
cold-bl9Â«ded â¢ proposition of the longest
pole ..knocking; down the persimmons I
can neither blame other jobbing centers
for striving to compete with us for thi<Â»
business.: nor the. railroads serving San
Francisco for competing with other trans
continental lines for their share of the
traffic."
"The trouble has been in the past m
this city to secure united concerted action
and It seems to me that we should put our
shoulder to the wheel and endeavor to
serve and protect our Interests rather
than depend upon what- others can do for
us."
"Had anything like this occurred af
fecting the trade of Chicago, St. Louis.
Kansas City. St. Josech or Omaha their
freight bureaus would have taken tha
matter up before the first ship leaving
San Francisco under -the new tariff had
docked at Seattle, and means would have
been found to correct the abuse or neu
tralize its effect by an independent line
run in the interest of the city affected.
"Take, for 'example, the change in rates
to some of the, Euget- Sound points-recent
ly made by the Pacific Coaat Steamship
Company after -the- control, of .Its, stock
was said to have oassed to the*- Great
Northern Railroad. Rates from San Fran
cisco to all points on the Sound except
Seattle and Tacoma -were materially in
creased, while to those two ports they re
mained the same; thus permitting the Job
bers of Seattle and Tacoma to use this
market for such emergency orders as they
found it necessary to Dlace here, but com
pelling the merchants ot Port Townsend,
Everett, Â¦ Anacortes, New Whatcom and
other points to make their purchases in
Seattle or Tacoma, thus Increasing: tli3
volume of business done for the Seattle
and Tacoma Jobbers by the Great North
ern road, and by the way incidentally re
ducing the volume done by the roads serv
ing San Francisco. Some little murmur-
Ing was heard, but no real effort wa3
made to recover trade thus diverted from
this city.
"Protests from individual firms or cor
porations or even from organized bodies
in particular lines of trade, against rates
detrimental to our city, while they may
meet with courteous consideration at tha
hands of common carriers cannot hope to
have the weight and influence which could
be exercised through an organization rep
resenting and supported by the entire
business community. Without such a bodv
organized' and existing for this specific
purpose the business men of the commu
nity are more than liable to patiently sub
mit to Questionable or even unfair.treat
ment without protest. . i'.-j . ; .
"Such a bureau, while it could not.per
form impossibilities and prevent Eastern
and Middle West cities from competing
with us for the export business, could be
of .vast benefit and could, doubtless, point
out the means of meeting our competitors
successfully as far as possible, There is
nothing whatever to prevent any one of
us from shipping our purchases direct
from the points of origin to Oriental
ports, thereby securing much of the ad
vantage now enjoyed by our competitors
of which we complain. For each . Indi
Â¦vldual. manufacturer or Jobber to secure
the information, necessary to compete' in
this manner Involves an amount of work
which they are not liable to do, but If we
could establish a freight bureau, where all
such data could be accumulated for the
benefit of its subscribers, not only on. that
subject, but on many others, it would do
much to correct existing discriminations,
prevent others, aid us to get around ob
stacles which cannot be surmounted and
restore our port to its former position ot
prestige and importance.
F. W. Van Slcklen of Dodge, Sweeney
& Co. believes that there Is a way to
make San Francisco a large distributing
center by -means of warehouses. Mr.
Van Slcklen said he believed that it would
be feasible for exporters In this city to
bring their goods to San Francisco for
exportation to the Orient on tho same
rates that are now given to Chicago, New
York and St. Louis. Awaiting 'orders,
these goods' could be placed; in, ware
houses here, and then,* moved 'accord-
Ing to the trade In the â¢ Orient . at
the proper time! The '. transportation
lines would get â¢ their -regular; -Ori
ental rate in full, and the freights would
be prepaid to the Orient, when the goods
were warehoused here. Perhaps a 'small
additional charge per 100 pounds might be
made, but that would not be sufficient to
shut San Francisco out of the trade of the
Orient. This Interesting suggestion will
get from the anxious commercial commu
nity the full attention that Its importance
merits.
Mr. Loveland said concerning the freight
bureau proposition which he advocates:
The peril to the . export Hrade of San
Francisco has led to someVlively- think
ing by the business -men i'of < this city.
Practical measures that ; may lead to
something- were suggested by
men prominent In tlie"commercial'commu
nity. H. D. Loveland,. vice president and
general manager of . Tlllmann & Bendel,
expressed the- opinion that- the., crying
need of the'.city'is a 'strong-, well-regu
lated freight bureau, under.: competent
management, uniting all mercantile and
manufacturing interests to the common
end of self-protection. .

Grip is here, but of a mild type. It still
commences with Catarrhal symptoms,
aching of the limbs, marked lassitude and
a rise of temperature, resembling the com-
mencing of Typhoid or Malaria.
The convalescents are apt to be troubl*d
for a- considerable ; period with weakness,
a general ; want of ' physical toneâ a condi-
tion to invite Pneumoniaj .-'
Paradoxical as it may appear, the light
attacks of Grip are oftentimes more dan-
gerous than the severe ones, as in, the
former Instances" the patients are more
apt to be careless of themselves during
the weak physical condition that foliow.
â¢The use 'of Dr. Humphreys' Famous
Specittc "77" breaks up the Grip, while
its-itonlclty sustains the flagging energies
during and after the. attack.

Big Death Bate for December.
Statistician Griffin' of the Board of
Health reports that during the month of
December, 1900, 649 deaths occurred in this
city, which is the- largest death rate ever
recorded here. This -number does not in
clude the deaths on two military reserva
tions and the bodies found in the bay and
ocean. The average death rate is about
E50 per month, and the increase for De
cember is due to the prevalence of grip
and pulmonary diseases. . j ,:.

EXPBESSES BELIEF
WHEN SENT. TO JAIL
Mrs. Juanita Thompson Pleads Guilty
of Assault With, a Razor on
Her Husband.
Mrs. Juanita Thompson expressed relief
yesterday when sentenced by Judge
Dunne to six months in the County Jail
for assault with a deadly weapon on her
husband, known around the water front
as "Captain" Thompson. She said for
that period of time at least she wo.uld be
safe from abuse at her husband's hand*.
After several years of domestic discord
Mrs. Thompson finally sought peace in
an effort to end her husband's life, an<l
armed with a razor she nearly succeeded.
On being arraigned before Judge Dunne
yesterday Mrs. Thompson pleaded guilty
to the charge against her. but pleaded
for lenlencr at the hands of the court,
for. she said, her husband's cruel treat
ment of her drove her to commit the deed.
Judge Dunne said he sympathized with
her, but in view of the facts and the law
he had no alternative but to pronounce
judgment.
.The principal interest of the realty buy
ers continues to center in business prop
erties, although there are many inquiries
for eligible lots upon which to erect
flats. The builders of flats are numeroua
ly in evidence, as may easily be ascer
tained by reading the builders' contracts
going on record. At the same~time there
is a fair business in residence properties.
The demand for room on Market, street
is illustrated . by. the fact that a large
part of the space in the nine-story office
and store building to be erected by James
L. Flood on the old Baldwin Hotel site
has already been rented before any start
has been made to build. Albert Pissis will
be the architect for Mr. Flood.

"that .Market street will have , a : great

Yet It -Is the only reason Mayor Phelan
gives for his urging that Ingleside be re-
San Francisco, it would seem, has had
enough of this. sort of gayety and sport.
It has paid more. than money for the lux
ury of Ingleside and its gamblers. It has
paid a dreadful price in honor and life,
and Mayor Phelan's suggestion that we
should reopen Ingleside simply for an op
portunity to dissipate and to license what
he calls pickpockets to prey upon us is
not likely to be accepted by the people of
San Francisco.
So extraordinary is this assertion of
Mayor Phelan that it might be reasonable
to suppose by his supporters that in
any newspaper . he had been misquoted,
but upon that question he has himself
left no doubt. He gave another inter
view yesterday to still another newspaper,
an evening sheet, which has frequently
enjoyed his patronage and in this inter
view he goes even further In extravagance
of support to Ingleside than he did in The
Call. In this second interview to another
paper Mayor Phelan says that he believt %
the people of San Francisco snuuiu ue'ai
iowed thirty days of dissipation, in which
they may relax their rules of life and in
dulge in gayety. And Mayor Phelan says,
in this, second interview, that the losses
which the public incur at the racetrack Is
part of the price which the public pays
for the sport. ;
The position assumed by Mayor Phelan
In this serious afialr seems to be almost
inexplicable, and it has occasioned the
most widespread comment. In an inter
view yesterday morning in The Call he
made the extraordinary assertion that he
wished to have Ingleside reopened for a
period of;thirty days every year â not be
cause he wished to encourage a legitimate
sport, because he believes he would not,
nor because he wishes to see, the people of
San . Francisco ; enjoy a healthful recrea
tion, but because he wishes to have the
people of San Francisco sunk in moral
drunkenness, in dissipation, for Â¦ thirty
days, while a set of thieves whom he
would set loose upon unsuspecting vic
tims picked their pockets under license of
law. -i.-'P^
Pickpockets as Civilizers.
ble in a Â¦way -which only an extraordinary
emergency could suggest. The pastor and
his congregation will assemble in mass
meeting to .denounce . the reopening of
Ingleside racetrack and to petition the
Board of Supervisors by resolution not to
revive the curse of bookmaking and pool
selling in this city simply to give to a set
of thieves the right to pick our pockets
and make innocent youth pay for Â¦ the
crimes of the rascals we will be forced
to entertain. The First Methodist Church
Is one of the most Influential in the city
and the public is invited to attend its
mass meeting this evening.
The efforts of the track gamblers to re
open Ingleside racecourse and to estab
lish bookmaking and poolselling and their
train of evils in this city have arouse-1
people of all classes to determined protect
and opposition. The extraordinary posi
tion taken by Mayor Phelan in open,
earnest advocacy of the scheme because
he believes that a &et of gamblers, now
prevented from operating, should have*
full sway for thirty days, has startled thd
community as it has been by no other
official act of the Mayor.
The disgraceful project and the s*Â»rlouÂ«5
menace Involved in the indorsement of
Mayor Phelan were topics oi absorbing
discussion yesterday by business an* pro
fessional men, merchants and ministers
and even' other reputable class of citi
zens. It was determined to take Instant
action to prevent the proposed outraes
arid it Is satisfactory at least thatif tho
conspirators present their measure to
morrow morning -it will not be . adopte-.l
without a protest which will show, that
the decent people of this city will not
submit without a struggle to this attack
upon their rights. Â£_
In every part of San Francisco to-day
ministers of the Gospel holding widely
different shades of religious opinion, wor
shiping under many different forms and
in many different sanctuaries, will sup
plement their regular services with ap
peals to their copgrecatlons for the sake
of their homes and their families and for
the community in which they live not t<>
permit this threatened renewal of a crim
inal traffic and thÂ© revival of a dread in
fluence in San Francisco.
Citizens to Protest in Mass Meeting.
These congregations in the agregate will
number thousands of the reputable-people
of this city, men and women who have
something at stake more sacred than that
which interests Mayor Phelanâ the giving
to a set of gamblers the shameful privi
lege of picking the pockets of San Fran
ciscans for thirty days every year. These
congregations represent all that is best
in the life of this city, its substantial com
merce, its .commercial success, the^ hon
esty of Its. young men, the honor of its
women, the sanctity and integrity of its
homes. And the Board of Supervisors will
be asked to heed the protests which in
the name of these congregations will be
voiced to-day. . " t
One of the most significant of these
meetings will be held to-night at the First
Methodist Episcopal Church on Powell
street,' near Washington. - The. regular
Sunday evening service of prayer will be
abandoned and at 7:30 o'clock the congre
gation, under the leadership of their pas
tor. Rev. L>r. Frank IC Baker, will assem-
SAN FRANCISCO REAL ESTATE MARKET
opened. And he declares that the succes
sors orCorrigan, Ullman and the gam
blers who ruined Ingleeide as a resort of
nigh class sport are sharpers who have
the same methods, the same schemes, the
same wretched, criminal devices of those
who preceded them and were driven from
this community. Mayor Phelan himself
calls them pickpockets and their game a
dissipating luxury for which the people of
San b ranclsco must pay dearly.
Even If the advocates of a revival of
track gambling were to forget themselves
and plead that their criminal game can
be made profitable without robbing the
public, a few facts, plainly stated, would
destroy their plea. Track gambling as
practiced here gives ample proof that it
cannot bft indulged except at a terrible
cost to the community in which It is per
mitted.
Vultures Feeding on. the Public
The books of the racing association
show that 1750 horse3 are in training here.
It requires $2 a day for every horse kept
in training, which means that for this
item alone S3M0 a day must be paid. It is
not paid by the horsemen, for they must
have a profitable business or leave It. It
is not paid by the bookmakers, for no one
ever accused th/m of philanthropy. It
is not paid by the association, as it is
not lrythe business of maintaining charity
stables. 1 The money Is paid by. the pub
lic, which gambles and must support thÂ«
game it plays before a dollar comes back
to it. Â¦ But $3500 a day for training horse3
is not the only item -which the public must
pay before It wins. . -
Tho bookmakers themselves must be
cared for by the very people -they- rob.
On an average twenty bookmakers "cut
in," or offer wagers, every day. For thin
privilege each bookmaker pays every day
to the association $120, or for them all a
total of $2400. To this must be added an
expense of $50 every day for each book
maker for clerical- expense, making-$10oO
more, or a total of $5400.
The bookmakers must obtain this money
from some source or go out of business:
they cannot gamble and lose, for few of
them go to jail. They cannot get the
money from the horse owners, for they
have their own tremendous expenses. The
association certainly will 'not pay it and
there is but one other source â the public,
which, on an average, pays the book
makers $3400 a day for the privilege of
Â¦ gambling. There is little wonder, that
Mayor Phelan calls his proteges pick
pockets.
But still the. terrifying cost of a race
course to a community in which it exists
has not all been told. The racing asso
ciation must- give purses. One of them
gave in one day not long since $2620. The
association does not pay it, but somebody
does, and'the public can guess who. When
the startling: fact is taken Into considera
tion that racing has been permitted for
150 days every year in this city, the
enormous cost to the city in money may
be estimated. And Mayor Phelan is mis
taken when he says that it would simply
be pocket-picking to permit the game for
thirty days. It would be a gigantic high
way robbery protected by municipal
criminal indulgence.

This was said as Mrs. Mulkey and Res

said, "and I don't think that had she in

When the repdrt of the revolver was

By her side lay the revolver the iwo

p^|*^ HE Senate Investigating Commil
i I tee. appointed to probe the San
1 1 Quentin Jute mill scandal, has
Ji visited the prison across the bay,
looked over the premises, exam
ined a few witnesses, enjoyed the hospi
tality cf the Warden and is now busiiy
engaged in preparing its report fThe com
mittee was delighted with the discipline
of the prison, but its report will probably
deal rather harshly with the business
methods in vogue there.
Senator Belshaw, chairman of the com
mittee, began work yesterday morning be
fore the boat that carried the inquisitors
across the bay left its berth on this side
Warden Aguirre had come over to escort
the Senators to the prison and Bel
ehaw turned his guns on him the moment
he came within talking range at the ferry
depot.
"Warden Ag-ulrre, have you any knowl
edge of the whereabouts of. Absconder
Walden?" demanded the Senator.
The Warden was rather surprised at the
abruptness of the query, but replied that
he did not know where the .missing clerk
of the Jute mill had secreted himself.
Further pursuance of me investigation
was pet-rponed until the committee ar
rived at the prison. The Senatorial In
quisitors were taken into every depart
ment of the penal Institution. They ex
amined the Jute mill and the methods em
ployed there, looked through the cells, tha
laundry and women's quarters, and last
but not least, partook of the bounteous
luncheon served at the Warden's residence
for their delectation. It was an excellent
luncheon and warmed the cockles of the
inquisitors' hearts until they declared that
the prison was splendidly conducted. Af
ter leaving, getting outside the prison
walls, however, the Senators decided that
while the luncheon was undoubtedly a
credit to the institution and while no fault
could be found with the discipline of the
prison, the business methods were so lax
that an indorsement of them was really
out of the- question. In fact the need of
a. revised eystem of bookkeeping was ap
parent to every member of the committee
before the investigation had progressed
hMf an hour.
Superintendent Byrne of the Jute mill
Informed the committee that he was
charged with all the Jute ordered frdra the
warehouse, with a discount of 5 per cent
cllowed for waste. lie was required to re
turn a certain numue. of sacks for a
specified amount of Jute furnished, but in
explaining his methods he unconsciously
exposed the laxity of the bookkeeping
methods employed in the mill by contin
ually referring to a number of slips of
paptr which he held in his hand.
Senators Belshaw and Tyrrell wanted to
know why he kept his accounts on memo
randum sheets instead of in books.
Warden Aguirre hastened to explain that
the State did not appropriate sufficient
money with which to purchase the neces
sary books.
A visit was then made to where the
srrain sack? were being marked and
weighed. The weighers were erltering the
results of their work on slips of papers
instead of in books, which fact Belshaw
was prompt to take notice of. He de
clared that books should be used to keep
the accounts and that triplicate records
should be made, one of which should be
turned over to the Warden and one to the
superintendent of the mill.
From the Jute mill the visitors passed
on to the convicts* dining-room. Hurry
ing waiters bearing plates of hot stew
brushed perilously past the members of
the committee, although it was half an
hour before the regular dinner hour. Sen
ator Tyrrell asked a guard if that was a
.sample of the meals served to the prison-,
ers.
' <Wh y. of course," replied ' the guard
with a knowing wink.
The Senators then visited the warehouse
â¢where all the bales of sacks are stored.
Senators Nutt, Belshaw and Tyrrell
thought that the bales should be piled in
rows and numbered positions assigned for
them. Those in charge of the warehouse
could then in ten minutes ascertain how
many bales they bad on hand. Shipping
Clerk MacD.^jal was called from his
lunch and examined.
"How often do you take stock. Mac-
Don pal?" asked Belshaw.
"We took stock with Expert MacLaren
the other day." he replied.
"You did not answer my question." In
sist c-d Belshaw.
"Oh. we don"t take stock, we Just clean
out the warehouse of sacks once a year "
replied MacDougal. *
"How often do you take an inventory?'
asked Senator Tyrrell.
"Well, I report how many sacks I re
ceive from the Jute mill to the Warden's
office once a month."
The conclusion of the committee after
the interview, with Shipping Clerk Mac-
Dougal was that in the future he should
not ship any sacks without first receiving
an order countersigned by the Warden of
the prison.
In the afternoon the Senators inter
viewed MacLaren, the book expert, who
was found working on the booka in the
main office. Prison Director "Wllkins was
also present.
"Are there any of the books of the Jute
mill missing?" asked Senator Tyrrell.
â¢'There is only one book missing." re
plied MacLaren.
"How far back are you going on the
books? he was asked.
, B l'J am soing back as far as the year
18SG and J expect to be finished by a 'week
from to-day," replied MacLaren.
T-,!r! d ,_ you llnd anything wrong with
Ellis books?" asked Tyrrell.
"No, I have not." was the answer.
"Have you found anything wrong with
the books at all?" queried Belshaw.
"Yes, I find no accounting for sixty-five
bales," replied MacLaren.
Prison Director Wilklns stated to the in
vestigating committee that when Mac-
Laren had handed in his report a meeting
would be held at the prison and the report
would be made public. *-
On the way back to the*clty the mem
bers of the investigating committee ex
pressed themselves in the following terms-
Senator Belshawâ I think that the dis
cipline of the prison is splendid, but the
checking system an*d>the way the goods
are shipped must be changed. New rules
must be adopted so that the Warden shall
be the only person authorized to ship mer
chandise.
Senator Nuttâ I think that stock should
be regularly taken once a month at the
warehouse and reported to the Warden
Books should be bought for the jute mills
and a regular check system adopted
Otherwise I think that the prison is run
on excellent lines, j
Senator Tyrrell of ' Nevada Countyâ 1
.think that this investigation will be pro
ductive of good. The bookkeeping sys
. tern at both the Jute mills and at the ship
,ping wharf Fhould be changed.
Senators Smith, Nelson, Plunkett and
Greenwell expressed similar opinions.
During the day members of the Assem
bly committee also visited the prison, but
as they arrived late their investigation
was necessarily hurriedly conducted. '
Senator Belshaw said last evening that
his committee would go to Folsom next
Saturdsy and inspect that prison, and
would then make reports to the Senate of
both prisons Pt the name* time. From
present Indication* the.report of the Sen
ate committee will severely criticize the
present business methods now in vogue at
San Quentin.
"The Prison of the Pope" is the title of
a lecture which the Rev. P. C. Yorke will
deliver in Metropolitan Hall on Thursday
evening, February 7. for the benefit of St.
John's Church. Father Yorke will discuss
the relations between the Vatican and the
Italian Government and their bearing on
the freedom of the Pope. The question
has attracted world-wide attention within
the past few weeks on . account of the
declaration of the Duke of Norfolk during
a public reception by Leo.
The English nobleman declared in favor
of the temporal power of the Pope and
maintained its necessity, .for the free ex
ercise of his splrtual authority in the
Catholic world. Such an utterance occa
sioned widespread comment in England.
Father Yorke made a thorough study ot
the situation while in Rome and he will
give his views on the question .in .the
coming lecture. Â¦ Â¦ â â¢Â¦- : Â¦ Â¦

his way he ->vould spend several weeks

"I have been to San Francisco several ;

"Do I play golf? Yes, I am Just learn- -
Ing the game, he went on. "It's a very
fascinating sport. I. have a lot of golf

"While at college. I did some boxing. I
have a punching bag In our private car.

The Duke and Duchess will not attend
any theaters or public amusement places
while here out of respect for the dead
Queen, although he says he could go if
he chose with propriety.- His Grace. wears
a black band . around the sleeve of his
bluish gray suit. He was considerably
agitated yesterday afternoon over a clip
ping from the Cincinnati Tribune, which
was uncomplimentary to Papa Zimmer
man.
"I have just wired the editor, whom I
know personally," he explained, "com
manding him to retract the story. If he
doesn't do so I will make it uncomforta
ble for the paper." arid the Duke's eyes
snapped and he stamped hid foot with an
air of determination.
Speaking of the Queen's death the Duke
Bald;
"Her demise is an irreparable loss to
the whole civilized world. Both as a
woman and a ruler she was the greatest
and grandest that ever lived. You can
little imagine the great sorrow of Eng
land. ' Royalty will mourn for three
months Just as you would mourn the loss
of your mother. All functions will bo
dispensed with. The royal ladies will not
appear in full dress, no diamonds will be
worn a-Â«i the palatial homes will be closed
during the period of mourning."
The DuUe.of Manchester is a handsome
young man of about 25 years, with a full,
smooth face and of athletic build. He has
large blue eyes and soft, light hair. He Is
essentially English in appearance and
manner, while the Duchess is of the Gib-
Bon girl type. She very modestly declined
to be interviewed.
The Duke called upon Mr. McCormick
at the Southern Pacific Railroad offices
>e*terday noon, where he received his
mall, which had been sent in care of Mr.
McCormick.
His Grace will dine at the McCormick
heme to-day. The Duchess is the favorita
child of Eugene Zimmerman, who Is re
puted to be one of the wealthiest men In
Cincinnati.
The presence of the young" Duka of
Manchester and his t>rtde in this city re
minds one that there are now four
Duchesses of Manchester. The first, Har
riet Sydney. Duchess of Manchester, was
a Miss Dobbs â an Irish lady. She mar
ried the sixth Duke In ISOo. On his death
she married Sir Stevenson Blackwood,
who died in 1S90. The second is the pres
ent Duchess of Devonshire, widow of the
seventh Duke of Manchester. The third
is Consuelo, the raoiher of the present
Duke and wife of the eighth Duke of
Manchester, better known as Lord Mande
ville. She is the daughter of Don An
tonio Tznaga del Valle of Raver.swood.
U. S. A. The fourth Duchesa was Miss
Zimmerman, the wife of the present Duke.
The young Duke has been on the stage.

They are traveling in a private car be

"Papa let us take the car," said the
Duke, "for a certain length of time. We

It < has been reported Â¦ that while Com
missioner Foote was in Paris he so far
cultivated the French language that Iris
only with difficulty that he can express
himself in.tood old Saxon. That is not
true. His verbal handling of the. care
less valet showed that he still had full
command of hismother tonsrue. /,,;:'. i"
The next time that W. "W. Foote. the
attorney, is asked 10 serve the State . in
the capacity of Commissioner In a foreign
land he will be more Particular when se
lecting a valet. One otthese accompaniei
him to thfi .World's Fair at Paris, but. in
the language of the South Side district, he
must have been "a bad 'un." He didn't
know the difference between .female lin
gerie and articles that are generally
bought in gentlemen's furnishing goods
stores. In packing up the trunks of Com
missioner Foote he failed to discriminato
in the matter of apparel and as a result
there was a warm cime at the Custom
house yesterday. If Commissioner Foole
had only been able td place his x hands
upon the offending- valet things would
have been much warmer. But the valet,
lucky for his bones, was absent and tha
incident passed off with some sulphurous
expressions emltted^bv Foote.
Commissioner .Koote. wmle In "gay
Paree," made a few purchases of silks,
laces, .etc., that are dear, to .the. feminine
heart, intending them for presents lor
friends. He knew that under, the law
only such goods as are for personal wear
are exempt from dutv. But the. valet, in
whom he placed" all his confidence and
trust, was not as well enlightened. -Ho
did not know that ladies', silk, stocking:!
could not possibly come under the head
of male attire and so it was that when
packing the trunks no made" his great,
grave and serious error. Articles of wear
that Commissioner Foote could not pos
sibly use were indiscriminately jammed
into the trunks containing u.a personal
gooda. The boxes and trunks set aside
by Foote for the presents he bought for
friends were utilized for storing, away
anything at hand. The Saratogas wer^
packed without any thought as to what
they contained. Now Commissioner
Foote believed that his valet had intelli
gence enough to know tiiat goods not for
personal wear are subject to duty. Ho
was desirous of paying for the dutiable
goodi, but the valet made a horrible mess
of things. When Foote reached this city
on his return trip he turned over the key*
of his trunks to the Customs officials In
order that they might examine the boxes
and see that there was nothing contra
band. Great was his surprise, then, when
he learned yesterday that his effects wero
detained ' in the Custom-house. The
searchers, much to their astonishment,
found a lot of ladies' gloves in the trunk
containing several pa:rs of the Commis
sioners' pajamas. The gloves were dutia
ble anil Foote was liable for smuggling
in addition to having the articles confis
cated. He was notified of the result of the
search of the trunks und hastened to the
Custom-house to explain just how it oc
curred. The matter was soon adjusted.
Foote's brokers arranged to havo the
goods separated and duty paid on the
Â¦tiutiable articles.

of American riders that have made
such a hit on the race courses of
Merrle England. Broderick Cloete,
the wealthy English turfman, who has
been SDending a few weeks in this State.
purchased the contract of Buchanan from
Barney Schrelber, the St. Louis book
maker and horseowner yesterday. What
the sum was that tempted the "genial
German" to relinquish all claim on his pet
rider .was not made public, but is said to
have been considerably over 53000.
Under jthe terms of his contract to ride
on the other side Buchanan is to receive
a salary of $8000 yearly for a term of three
years, which sum will be materially in
creased by outside mounts he may get.
Then again there is much honor attached
to the position, for the California boy will

During his racing career Hamburg- was
a marvel of speed, capturing amontf
other classic events the Flash stakes,
Congress Hall stakes, the rich Realiza
tion at one and five-eighth miles and the
Brighton cup.
This phenomenal horse was purchased
in 1897 by Marcus Daly for $41,000. Like
his illustrious Fire, Hanover, Hamburg
was accused of being a "quitter." Speak
inp of this one day at Anaconda Mr.
Daly said: "It cost Mr. Haggin and my
self a great many dollars trying to make

ThÂ« rundown of the- big. 112-doff open
stake at Union Coursing Park yesterday
attracted a larger 1 crowd than has been
seeo at the grounds on a Saturday for
many months. The card offered resulted
in a good day's sport, and at no time dur
ing: the day was interest lacking-
It was a great day for the backers of
favorites, as in all there were but nine
short-ends lucky enough Jo have their col
ors raised, and in seven of these events
the odds were 5 to 3.
Curtis & Sons' Vulcan made his first ap
pearance after a long rest, and to show he
etill retained some of his old-time speed,
and stamina won a good course irom
Sweet Kmma, a favorite In the betting, at
5 to t. Vulcan was a contestant in a nnal
at San Mateo Park, which resulted fa
tally for Wanda, his opponent, i It was
thought this would prove the undoing of
the curtls dog. ' â¢ â¢ â¢Â¦
The linals to-day should furnish some
close going. i Greenhall and America are
even tavorites in the long odds book for
ttrat honors, being held at 6 to X. flood
gate, Chicago Boy and Mac's Melody are
quoted at 6 to 1, while Royal Flush is sell
lne at 8 to 1. . '
Cireenhall looks best at the top of the
card, â¢ while America seems to be in. a
groove of his own at ihe lower end. ThesÂ»e
two of first choice will not. meet except in
the final and the chances are more In.
favor of the Emln Pasha representative.
Amerlca'B only hard opponent, according
to the figuring of his backers, would be
Mac's Melody and If she should be for
tunate enough . to gain the right to con
tost -with him it is .thought .that she will
have had too much work to win out from
the youngster. . ,
The Champion stake-will be run off In
Its entirety and with the bunch of fast
ones entered a treat- is in store for to
day's patrons. Â« Â¦ â¢
Beacon holds first claim on the purse?
of the bettors. He is already a favorite
for the staka at the prohibitive odds of
6 to 5. . -.-Â¦-â¢â¢â¢â¢

"nomination of the .first five officers within
thirty minutes," was In direct violation of
the spirit of a resolution previously adopted,
to the effect that all the candidates whose
names had been presented should appear before
the convention, formally pledge themselves
to its platform and be questioned as to their
position on any subject raised by the assem
bled delegates; also that this should, be done
before final action and in executive session.
Some of the candidates whose names had
been presented for Mayor as well as for other
offices were not present.
There -was an evident purpose to railroad
candidates . through regardless of any oppor
tunity for discussing their merits and. con
trary to all precedent in former conventions
of the league.
There was however, another reason for my
withdrawal more vital and more far-reaching.
It was because I became last night fully
convinced of what I had for some time feared,
viz.: That a spirit of narrowness, bigotry and
extreme partisanship had gained Â¦ the ascend
ancy in the councils of the league, that it no
longer stood â¢ for the high principles avowed
In its constitution and in its platform, but
had been prostituted to serve the purposes of
a mere faction of the Republican patty whose
grievance, dates back to - the Congressional
campaign' of last summer.
There was a strong effort made last night
to pledge the convention In advance not to
nominate for any office any man who would
also accept a nomination at the hands of the
Republican convention to-day.-
I regard this policy as extremely narrow
and unwise.. 1
While I was not committed tolany particu
lar ' candidate who seemed likely \to receive, a
nomination at that convention and doubted If
we could indorse many, if any. of their can
didates! yet I wanted . the league to b# free
to indorse pood men wherever they could be
found, regardless of. the fact of their be
ing either, nominated or rejected by any other
party.
This I have understood to represent the non
partl;an spirit and purpose of the league. If
I am mistaken In thls.^then I have- been out
of place In being a member thus far. '
I think I can best answer the question as to
my attitude < on Â¦ the water Â¦ question by stating
that the planks In the league's platform re
lating to "public ownership and water sup
ply," nlso "control ; over corporations operat-
Inr public utilities" were a part of my contri
bution to that document, and 'were considered
strong enough to be adopted by my associ
ates on the committee. ' These planks express
my sentiments on thÂ«se nueitlons.. . "

and auotes the United States Supremo

OAKLAND. Jan. 26.â The Rev.
Ernest E. Baker, D. D., pastor of
the Woodland Avenue Presby
terian Church of Cleveland, who
comes to Oakland in response' to
the invitation of the trustees of the
First Presbyterian Church, will preach
to-morrow morning and evening. The
Law of Christ" â¢will be his theme in the
morning and in the evening he will ad
dress himself to "The Catholic Life.
The following Sunday he will deliver two
sermons and on Monday. I-ebruary 4, he
will return to his Cleveland home.
"The trustees, as far as their power
goes," Dr. Baker said to-day, "have prac
tically called me. but, of course, the
Â¦whole matter is to be determined by the
members of the church. As for myself. I
cannot say what I will do, as everything
Is in abeyance as yet. The. many years
I have labored In Ohio have made me be
lieve a change would be desirable, though
It may prove too radical."
It is stated that Dr. Baker's Eastern
congregation, before ; which he has
preached the last four years. Is loth to
have him go and a strong effort will be
made to induce him to stay In Cleveland.
In that event the First church trustees
would be greatly disappointed, as their
search for a pastor to fill the pulpit made
vacant by the resignation of Dr. R. F.
Coyle has been a discouraging one.

ICEw YORK. Jan. 2*. â The stock market
rr.an!f<a^Â«l <^nly a lang-uH dlspofition to re
epend to the very active and bold manipula
tion tn whi^Ti it vat subjected to-day until
the a-prearanc* of the bank statement. 1m
inÂ»iiately upen the appearance of the state

erably, nevertheless the market remained spotty

r.un-.ber of Ftccks which show advances of 1
to 2 ro'Â«r.tÂ« many rarts of the list 'failed to
r**pcr!(3 to thÂ» advance at all. St. Paul was
the feature s,!l day. The stock tva* exceedingly
fe\ - *rifh and unsteady st times, but it was
aSvarced with d^tTrr.inatinn and made the
last rri-e at the top - poteta at>ovÂ»Â» laÂ«t ftipht.
The |1Â« all I us were on a very lar^,- scale. The
preferred stork -;.;r,:i t\. The Kar.ea? and
Texas flocks continued to hold a conspicuous
plae* In tfaa market and th* preferred rose

from profit-taking. Rock IÂ»land roÂ«e 2*Â» and
thÂ« prar-iF'rs and Northern Pacific were all
â¢troE#r. The har.k statement disclosed a fairly
plethoric condition Bf the raonÂ»y market and
tfce in>eral exran^ion cf loan* by the
banks of over t2fl.O0i>,<yX) ha* not sufflcM to
keep pact with the rapid congestion of re
ef-i-v^F. A notable feature cf the cash increase
is the overwhelming preponderance of specie
In th* rwPir.Ts. The week's Increase of $?.-
Ci?.4 ff i brings the ppe'-ie holdings of the New
Tor* Ur.kÂ» up to K.rn.Zir.tX. which compares
with the maximum ri^xird of $2."60.S76.500. on

ceived payment frcm the sub-treasury on ac

reserves eventually. It iÂ« worthy of notice that
ail of the t4.'*K',000 gold sported this week
a!so came from the Government assay office.
TbÂ«Â» Â»peot:latjve conti?u-'ent in the *tock market
evidently locks to this redundancy of loanable
resources to stimulate speculative buying of
(totks. It is also certain to stimulate the gold
export movement. With a further rise to-day
fa the quoted rateÂ« for sterling exchange in
the nominal Saturday market, with advances
Jn th* rail meney rate in London and with
ttTMnc hardening at Paris, It Is not
unlikely that the coming week will see gr>\i
to to London instead of to Paris. The re- i
mlttances abroad In payment of returning I
â¢#curitiÂ»>* continue on a large scale and keep
up the exchange rate. The action of the nook
market this wÂ«>k has been strictly In accord
with what cnight be expected from the adjust
ment Ot arounts after a prolonged period of |
active speculation. As speculative buying: in
variably carriea prlrfs al>ove a normal point,
â¢o that the realising of profits necessitates a
downward reaction, so speculative selling car
rier crlces below the normal, with a neces
sary upward, reaction -when the bears take
their prcflt* by buying stocks to cover their
short cor.trarts. The latter Is what occurred
in the early part of the weÂ«k and the upward
rebound was aggravated by the fact that a
combination of the more alert professional
operators turned fro:n the bear to the bull
aide of the market and commenced ostenta
tlousl3' buying stocks and bidding up prices,
while at the same time putting out various
Intimations and rumor* to account for the ad
vace*. eocie cf them with enough show of
probability to attract an outside demand. But
the Â«ub*e<juent action of the market made It
pretty clear that the principal demand of the
early part cf the week came from the over
extended short interest. This was particularly
true of Missouri Pacific. The demand for this
stock was urgent when rumors were circulated
that it was to be the central feature in a vast
â¢cheme of consolidation of Southwestern rail
road propertita. The premium paid for the use
of thÂ« stock for delivery Indicated a large short
Interest and there s*e-ned to be a practical
corner !n the stock. Reports were revived that
the Â£t. Paul-Northern Pacific-Great Northern
deal was on foot again and the inference was
*ncQurared that tbe threatened rupture among
the great eteel combinations was about to be
patched up to the mutual benefit of all par
ties. Forae of last weok'e selling had been on
the supposition that the death of Queen Vic
toria would have a derreysing Influence on the
world's securities markets, and r-hen the quiet
steadiness of prices in foreign markets after
that event became manifest there was some
buying to cover short* as a consequence. " The
early upward movement waa followed by a
reaction en profit-taking and again by a sec
ondary rebound. The speculative world Is bÂ»
gihr.ir.g to eanvaÂ«s the future again In the
conviction that the influences of the past hav*
loÂ«t their force. The late cf tbe country'* crop
for the coming rear must again be reckoned
Â¦with. The condition of the Iron trade Is
eagerly scrutinized, with opinion much an
settled and conflicting as to its future. Grow
ing importance is attached to the coming test
of the new feature of the bank currency law.

the banks to keep their notes In circulation.
As they do not figure In the money reserves

unless they can be kept in circulation. The

CLOSING.
X^W YORK. Jan. 26.â The- Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market was listless to-day but firm.
There was little trading from thÂ» general list.
The American department was an exception.
American shares' recox-ered sharply from the
depression here yesterday on the lead given
by N'w York's close and opening. Chicago.
Milwaukee and St. Paul was the most prom
inent stock and with the rise appeared a re
vival-.of the reports of the Hill deal, vrtth
many circumstantial details. It la notable that
although heavy options in Americans are ma
turing the market at the end of the month
shdTjs no sign of disturbance. Money rates
wpe unaltered.
London Market.
The Financier says: The Sew York state
ment for the week was markedly another
heavy rise In all the principal Itemt, loans
have expanded $10,433,000 and deposits $15.
635.&00, while -the pain la cash, mostly in the
form of specie, -was in rough numbers $7,
600,000. The reBUlt of the changes noted was
an Increase of the surplus reserve of $3,542,850,
bringing the total of its cash in the New York
banks to J30.799.450, the highest surplus report
ed sines February 3 last. The chief feature of
Interest, as In the previous week, Is the great
rise- In loans. A week ago the record break-
Ing expansion was caused by the consum
mation of railroad deals of magnitude, but in
the present exhibit the gain is due probably
to Investments In sterling, buying of whlcn
has been active of late, and to buying of com
mercial paper, which is coming on the market.
The system of averages employed in compiling
the statement makes it also probable that part
of the previous week's heavy business has
been carried Into thÂ« current totals. The gain
In cash reflects almost altogether receipts from
interior institutions, as Sub-Treasury opera
tions. Including thÂ« week's export of gold,
made the banks debtors instead of . creditors,
as has been the case for many weeks pa?t.
It is notable, however, that of the week's
gold receipt*, all but about Jl.000.000 went into
one bank. The heavy excess of gold receipts
over legal tender In the character of the cash
gains Is explainable on the ground that the
New York institutions are receiving from their
bank correspondents an unusually heavy per
centage of gold certificates, a very convenient
form of remittance. The Increase In the de
pofit item Is less than called for by the
changes In. other Items, but the Increases are
distributed rather unevenly among the larger
banks. An interesting feature, in ' a gain of
$;g'>.000 in the circulation item at a time when
It would seem there was less need of circula
tion than for a year. It 1Â« perhaps true that
this is only a temporary fluctuation due to
causes foreign to the usual principle covering
new circulation.

LOCAL MARKETS.
Corn was fairly active and lnclinfd to follow
wheat, but the prospect of favorable weather
and estimates for heavier receipts '.for Monday
and profit-taking by provision people interested
in Â¦ corn prevented the market from :.-- gaining
much over yesterday's level. May closed un
changed at 39Jic
Oats were quiet. The wheat strength waÂ»
Influential . but pressure from local longs was
against the price. May closed a shade lower
at 25Hc . :"--'-Â»* Â¦ Â¦ - ~ J ~ '-Â¦"â¢ -: ..-,-- . -.
Â¦ Provision* were quiet and ' steady, supported
by the wheat strength Â«nd a fair cash demand.

were Inclined to support prices. May; pork
CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â May "wheat opened a
shade to higher at 77@77He,- mainly be _
cause It had not lost the upward Impetus given
It yesterday. The moderation of Northwest re
ceipts, was also somewhat influential.. On thÂ«
other hand, cables reflected the advance here
yesterday only In part and longs seized the op
portunity of taking profits on the opening
bulge. There was also some selling by bears
and May eased to 16%c during the first hour.
Commission house* drank . up their offerings,
however, and when they ceased to flow cried
for more. May accordingly rallied to 77%c be
fore the desire for profits again asserted itself
in. any force. This caused a decline to 77c, but
the demand was itlll sharp and a raily to
77T4C ensued. The close was strong. May %iS.\c
higher at 77Â«ic. Foreigners were reported as
enlisted on the buying side and this had some
thing to do In advancing prices. The crop
around Bombay was reported in bad shape
but In otber parts of India the cereal, it was
said, was faring well. Small Argentine ehip
irients -were prophesied as the rule for sorno
time to come. Cash trade was slow. Â¦

The process of refining California petroleum
Is by no means perfected, but as experiment*
are being mads the refined product is being
bettered every month. If. however, bill No. IX
Is passed and It becomes necessary to manu
facture oil to stand a test of 130 degrees tha
industry of refining California oil will bÂ«

by Pennsylvania. The Pacific OU Report
er says: ::..-<
An oil exchange is wanted at Riverside,
and a committee is at work trying to or
ganize one.
There is a great deal of opposition
amon<r the California oil men to the Sen
ate bill introduced at Sacramento by Sen
ator Currier to provide for the inspection
of illuminating oils manufactured from
petroleum, or coal oils. The objection is
based on the fire test of 130 degrees, which
is a much highest test than the one made
on section A. 29-2S. By the terms of these
leases tho Wilson receives tho <1ifÂ«renoÂ»Â»
between 37^and 50 per cent as royalty. anÂ«l
in.adcr.tion gets large bonuses. The leases
are thiee In number and each contain ten
acres. They were taken by San Francisco.

in each Instance tho agreement was en

There has always been faith In the territory
south of. the river, but until now it has failed
to take the form of money investment. This
fact is .perhaps duÂ« to the opportunities of
fered In other localities where success was
assured, people . having taken more readily to
operations where^no risk, comparatively, was
Involved. Now that royalties have risen in the
demonstrated field to the 50 per cent point, the
temptation" to go ' elsewhere and . assume risks
with the ' chance of larger reward has grown
greater. Section 17, 29-28. will soon have a rig
working on It, the Bouth half of the north
eaet quarter 1 having â¢ been leased by Elodget
and Harding to Ludwlg and Hlcfcey, who have
operated for thirty years In the Pennsylvania
and Ohio fields. They will be prepared to go
to a depth of 1.W0 feet If necessary to get the
oil, but Mr. Hfckey, who is now on the ground
thinks-: that M05O will let the ' drill Into the
pay stratum. Arrangements have been made
for machinery. ".
On the other hand, the Kern County oil
producers would seem to be getting on
with their marketing plans very well. The
large tanks in the field. have been leased
by the Producers' Association, and thfse
furnish ample accommodation for the sur
plus ptocks, which are now accumulating
faster than will be the case when better
shipping facilities are provided. ~-
The Bakersfleld, Calif ornlarf reports that
interest in tho territory south of the Kern
River has revived. The- Calif ornian says'
of the section: ;.
To add trouble to trouble, it is now stated
that . the Storaze and Transportation Company
refuses to entertain an agreement from a mi
nority of the* producers, and proposes to can
cel the agreements already made, although it
is not clear when the Storage and Transpor
tation Company will profit by such a decision
any . more . than will the producers by entering
the compact. . .
With this idea in view, a number of pro
ducers have â¢ entered into an agreement with
the Storage and Transportation Company on
the basis named. The remaining producers re
fuse to sign such an agreement, and the situ
ation, as far as the marketing question Is con
cerned. Is somewhat demoralized. The system
of each Individual producer marketing' his own
oil is not one that will tend to maintain
prices, a consummation devoutly hoped for by
the oil men.
The original proposition of the Storage ami
Transportation Company to charge 10 cents a
barrel for storage was modified to 10 per cent
of tha oil received. No guarantee was given
as to' price, and a strict test on all oil re
ceived was part of the proposition. Much of
the oil In the. local field contains 1 more or less
water, holding It In suspension, ranging from
a very small percentage to as high as 30 per
cent. Â¦ Heretofore the Storage and Transpor
tation Company accepted the oil at the wells
without question. The new rule promulgated
compels .the producer to pay H cent on eacli
barrel of oil holding , 10 per cent or more of
water. These requirements are entirely un
satisfactory to the producers, but In the opin
ion or many they should be accepted, as the
only possible means of preventing a shaky and
unstable market.
How to market California petroleum to
the best advantage Is the problem that Is
engaging the attention of two leading: oil
sectionsâ the Kern County fields and the
Los Angeles territory. Latest advices are
that the Los Angelenos and their fellow
oil producers In Southern California have
not had much success as the result of sev
eral conferences with the Storage ana
Transportation Company people. Chaos,
according to the Los Angeles newspapers,
would seem to exist. An association to
provide for marketing the Los Angeles
product and following out the general
plan of the Kevn County association may
be formed. A Los Angeles paper says:
A number of notice* of location of borax
mlnee have been filed in San Diego Coun
ty. These claims are located on the des
ert, about twenty miles south of Borego
Eprlngs and about thirty miles east from
Julian. The section is known as the Mc-
Cain mining- district.
Considerable development work Is going
on in the southern part of Inyo County,
near the San Bernardino County lino. The
Defiance mine has gone into the hands
of San Francisco parties. Prospecting is

A circumstantial account of the devel
opment of copper properties In Shasta
County is given by Mineral Wealth. In a
few weeks the second large smelter for
the copper belt, so says the writer, will
be running. The De Lamar smelter, which
will reduce the ores of thÂ»Â» Bully Hill
mines, is about completed and calcining
will begin when the rolling stock Is on the
track that has been laid. It is probable
a railroad will be constructed to. connect
with the main line alter a while. Several
miles of wagon road have been complet
ed, connecting with the Copper City road
lit Sllverthora ferry, to facilitate the haul-
Ing of flux. Men ars working near tha
mouth of the McClouJ taking out iron and
lime for fluxing purposes. A report la
current that the management of the Bully
Hill will increase the smelting capacity of
its properties to at least 500 tons. There
it also an understandina that the Mlchl
pan group will become the property of
De Lamar. Development work has been
proceeding on these claims for the last
two years. Consolidation of the proper
ties would bring into existence in time
one of the greatest smelting plants of
the West.
A correspondent of the Mining and
Scientific Press writes as f ollovds concern-
Ing the outlook for mining in the Philip
pines:
The plans of thft Keswick Electric Pow
er Company, whoso plant will furnish
power for mining properties at the north,
have bten set forth uv Manager Shan
con. The power-house will be situated at
the head of Battle Creek bottoms, twenty
seven miles from Redding, twenty-eight
miles from Red Bluff and about the sama
distance from Copper City. The company
proposes to supply power to Red Bluff.
Tehama, Vir.a and Corning on the south
end Redding. Keswlck and the copper belt
of Shasta County on tne north. From the
power-house a line of pipe 6000 feet long
end 30 Inches In diameter will be laid to
the company's works. The pipe will' have
a fall of 11S0 feet. Tho company has pur
chased water in Mill Creek. Berry Creelc
itnd Battle Creek and also an interest In
the Battle Creek Company's ditch. A
large storage reservoir will be construct
ed on Mill Creek on the old Huster ranch.
While copper mining Is becoming more
Important in the United States, It is
growing less Important In England. The
report of the English mine Inspector for
1900 is Just out. This makes the facts
plain. In 1863 the production of copper
and copper ore precipitate amounted to
more than 200,000 tons and was valued at
half a million sterling. In 1899 the Eng
lish copper product was worth only Â£35,000
In round figures. Cornwall and Devon
shire produce about all the English cop

in mining in England In 1900 was 764.166.
of whom 728,000 worked under the coal
mining act and 35,157 under the metal
liferous mines act. Of the surface work
ers 4702 were female. There was an in
crease of female workers in the coal
mines, but a falling of in the number in
the metalliferous mines.

James Hayes of Corvallls has written an
account of the discovery of Gold Hill,
Jackson County, Oregon, which was
found by him. He/was ridine with a man
named Chavner, on whose ranch he was
working. He had made a failure in pros
pecting for gold the preceding yÂ»ar. Go
ing down a steep incline the saddle on
which he was riding gave wav and threw
him over the horse's head. When he got
up to cinch the saddle he discovered some
! thing shining on the ground, which proved
to be gold quartz. He afterward returned
to the place where he had found the
quartz, taking two companions and easily
located the spot and was able by search
ing industriously to find other specimens
of gold quartz on the ground. While he
was doing this he climbed a hill and found
a. rock formation of a steel gray color.
He had a pick with him and with this at
tacked the rock formation and was as
tounded to find that gold abounded in the
rock. One of ' his companions become
drunk and told the whole town, so that
there were at least 130 men on the ground
ths next day, seeking locations. Every
day for a time added to this number of
men gold seekers. Hayes was not much
more than a boy, and being itrnorant of
.mining, did not realize the value of his
discovery. He says:
Had I been older In the ways of the world
I would have resolved myself Into a gold
trust and run it alone. But being a more boy,
I did Just what any other boy would have donÂ«.
under the circumstances. The emigrant and r
lay there several nights on the mountains,
spreading cur blankets over the rich quartz
we had gathered and eleeplnsr on the came as
if on downy feathers. The miners would steal
our cuartx from under our heads and work
all manner of echemes on us to set hold of the
quartz, and that would be the last of It. Ish
supposed he owned the earth, went to Jack
sonville to celebrate and got on a big epree.
Ish's credit for whleky had risen from zero
to 100 cents on the dollar. The Â«mlRrant and
I, of course, held down our possession, being
on duty day and night, while Ish performed
the kingly part. I have been averse to co
partnership ever since. There Is no exaggera
tion In the statement that thousands of dol-.
lars were ricked up from our pile of quartz
by the ru*h of people. Ish, our partner, gave
two rambler*, known^as Jack Long and Mil
ler, an Interest In the mine. He even as
sumed to act as our general guardian and dis
pensed his bl^pslncs to all comers. 1, too,
became generous, and gave Tom Chavner, my
old friend, an Interest in the mine.* The emi
grant kept his Interest for some ' time and
llnally sold a third of his Interest for SjOOO.
Being ignorant, 1 1 was easily imposed on, and
sold my Interest for the small sum of HOW.

aggregate area of which is something
