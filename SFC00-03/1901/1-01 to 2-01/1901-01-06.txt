For many reasons It looks as though
the Cudahy abduction might ha-rs been
carried out by some of the same people
who participated In the Campbell affair.
or by persons who had mads a study of It
and avoided Its mistakes.
In the Campbell abduction the maa
thleves had reasoned well, but still easM
to fallacious conclusions. They took aa
old nan, wealthy and far from home,
but though 63 years of age. he was far
from being feeble and felled one> of his
captors with a blow of his fist. Further
more, the very fact of his aja made him
put such a light value upon the remainder
of his life that his affection for his fam
ily overwelghed It. Also as tha captors
had him bound hand and foot, and It was
necessary. to keep him Â«f>, ticre was.no
one' to draw the large sum of money from
the bank without exciting: suspicion. la
the Cudahy affair all of this was reversed.
The goose which was to lay the golden
egg was unhampered. The child was too
young to make troublesome resistance,
and that powerful force, parental affec
tion, which, brought to the test, overpow
ers'all other human emotions, was enlist
ed upon the side of the plottera. Cudahy
may have technically compounded a fel

toads and found that every enÂ« oS thos*
in the sandstone cells was dead. Their
bodies were considerably decomposed,
showing that they must havÂ» baen dead
for months. A majority of the larger
toads in the block of limestone wÂ«rÂ» alive,
but in every instance the glass covers
were cracked.
The toads were -weighed, and it was
found that No. 1 had decreased from 92-t
grains to 60S grains; No. 5, from, US3 to TZ3
grains, and No. D had increased from 9SS
to 1116 grains. In the case of No. 9 the
glass wag cracked and insects had got in
side, so that the toad had found plenty of
food. In the case of the other two toads,
while the glass was not cracked much of
the clay had fallen off and had. of course,
left an aperture.
The conclusions at which the professor
arrived were these: That toads cannot
live a year totally excluded from atmos
pheric air. and that, they cannot live two
years when they are totally deprived of
food.
Four toads were also placed In a block
of plaster of paris in cells four Inches
deep and five Inches In diameter. At tho
end of one year the toads nearest the sur
face were alive, the other two dead. Tho
professor concluded from this that plaster
of parls Is porous and admits air.
When a miner or a fanner finds a toad
In a piece of coal or in a tree he naturally
pays more attention to the toad than to
the cavity, and as no examination is ever
made until tho toad is discovered by
breaking the mass In which It Is contained
âwhen It Is too late to ascertain with pre
cision whether the cavity was air tight
no satisfactory results coud be obtained.
The professor's experiments, however, re
move all doubt as to tho remarkable vital
ity of toads.
Some toad3 placed in a specially pre
pared cavity of an apple tree by tho pro
fessor at the same time were all found u
OCCASIONALLY the discovery of live
toads lnc'.osed within blocks of
stone and wood, in cavities that ap
part ntly had no connection with the
outside air, has led to the common belief
that they can live without air. Toads
have quite frequently been found In trunks
of trees, and' have often been found by
miners deeply Imbedded In strata of coal.
With a view to ascertaining just how
true was the notion that toads do not re
quire air, the ReV. W. Buckland, late pro
fessor in the University of Oxford, recent
ly made some Interesting experiments,
. He first secured a large block of coarse
oolitic limestone and prepared twelve cir
cular 1 cells in It. each about one foot deep
and five Inches In diameter, and having a
groove or shoulder at Its upper margin so
fixed as to receive a circular plate of glass
and a circular piece of slate to protect the
glass; the margin of this double cover was
shut up tightly, so as to render It perfect
ly impenetrable to air and- water. He
then prepared twelve smaller cell3, each
six Inches in depth by five Inches In diam
eter. In a large block of . siliclous sand-
Stone, these cells also being covered with
glassy'and slate and fluted around with
soft clay.
The object of the glass covers was to
allow the toads to be seen without having
to remove the lids and thus let. in air and
Insects. The limestone was porous x and
was not Impervious to water, and prob
ably allowed air to get In also. The sand
stone, h6wever, was very compact.
One live toad was . then placed In each
cell, the covers were placed on and ce
mented down. The weight of each toad
was carerully ascertained by two physl
â¢ dans, the smallest of the toads being
found to weigh 115 grains and the largest
11S5 grains. . The large i and small toads
were distributed equally between the lime
stone and the sandstone cells.
: Both stones " were- then burled -under
three feet of earth. After thirteen months

One night the violinist's work was over,
he thought, and he went comfortably to

It was after midnight when he was

"A message for you," he heard breaking
in upon a dream of nocturnes and sona

Gould. Music was wanted -immediately
at the hotel.
VThis is most disgusting," he protested
while getting into his clothes.
He could not go until the artistic hair
was brushed correctly and the mustache,
the delicate, subtle mustache, curved to
a nicety.
Then he hastened. He was altogether
displeased; at being awakened^ from the
Bleep which an artist needs,' but he felt
it best to hasten. .
When he reached 1 the hotel he found
that ho was expected in Its theater^ Here
he found a small party impatiently wait

"Hurry up," .they cried. "We want to
dance."
They hurried him almost off his trim

Ordinarily we do not look to the bear

posed that calves actually wept. The term

Now, It comes to light, through experl

that calves do possess lachrymal glands,

their corners distress.
Deer are also endowed with a similar
tppaxatus, and when a stag is at bay It
"weeps hot tears." On examining the
eyes of wounded deer It was found that
they were literally swimming with tears,
caused by the pa!n and alarm under which
the animal labored.
On removing a calf from Its mother
tears were seen to be streaming from its
eyes lor.g after the first excitement had
passed over. This seemed real grief and a
special record was kept of that case. On
examining other . calves, under similar
circumstances, the fact came out that all
When the giraffe is wounded, if the pain
be severe, it shods tears, and its grief is
not allayed until the wound censes to
throb. Giraffes have brr>n eeen to weep
also from wounds, which. wTiile not es
pecially painful, are disfiguring to the fine
coat with which their body Is adorned.
Perhaps the esthetic taste of the giraffe
Is wounded deeply at the disfigurement;
perhaps Its soul cannot bear tho sight of
blood. These latter points yet remain
mysteries to science.
Elks weep when wounded, especially if
the wound be slight in its nature. On
deeply wounding an elk no tears are ob
servable. It is the smarting superficial
wound that brings out the tears in this in
stance.
The lachrymal duct of the ape opens on
slight provocation. When vexed an ape
will cry. especially if he is unable to re
taliate. Apes have also been seen to weep
when badly frightened.
The ape is also afflicted, when alarmed,
with a nervous chattering- of the teeth,
very much like the 'nervous chill" which
human brings sometimes have under sim
ilar circumstances. Â¦
Elephants, in captivity, have been
known to weep Incessantly. Captivity! is
borne by elephants with little grace. All
are restless most of the time, and some
never cease to shed- tears.
When an elephant has been unsuccess-
ful In an attempt to escape it seems his
spirit is forever after downcast. Keepers
of elephants under these circumstances
have found that the poor brutes cry most
of the time.
Elephants have always exhibited very
human traits; but this one" of crying
brings them closer, to the human family
than any other attribute.' An elephant
weeps practically for the same cause
which would make a man weep. On set

"The Palae* of the King." by Mar
lon Crawford, which Is now putf
li?hed in book form after having appeared
as a serial In one of the magazines. It is
a romance pure and simpleâ all diversity
of Incident with no attempt at anaylsis
Â«tf character. Now that the romantic
r.ovel is having a renewal of its day, al
most any story tnat Is written in readable
Engllfh and crowded with a sufficient
number cf stirring scenes stands a good
chance of being sold by the thousand and
perhaps even attaining to the dignity of a
Christmas edition with binding and illus
trations of the most approved elegance.
While this last book of Crawford's is
better than some of the novels of the
year which have mot with success, it is
r.ot a book that will repay a second
reading, as its chief charm lies In its
wealth of novel incident, and in the swift
unfolding of Its plot. Still, the romance
is well worth one readlnp to a person who
cares for the class of fiction to which It
belong?.
It may not be amiss In this connection
to quote a short paragraph written by the
late Eugene Field in 1S94. which read:
"The new National Library will have
rpace for four million books. We men
tion this merely to encourage Mr. F.
Marlon Crawford to keep right on."
"Whether or not Mr. Crawford has been
actuated by Mr. Field's good advice Is a
hard matter to sayâ but certain it is that
he has "kept right on." and Judging from
the number of volumes he has turned out

room adjoining that in which Dolores is
looked. Philip prows enraged at Don
John and strikes him to the floor, ap
parently killing him. Dolores hears the
Quarrel, its end. and then the entrance of
her father. She hears Mendoza implore
the King to let him bear the blame cf

" Spencer's "First Principles."
Herbert Spencer's "First Principles" has
become an established classic of philo
sophical literature, eo tnat the appear
ance of a new edition to meet public de- '
mand Is not surprising; nor is it neces
sary to make any comment upon the na
ture of a work so well known even to
those who have not read it but who have
learned of it through the widespread pop
ularity given to its essential elements and
doctrines. Evolution has become the ac
cepted philosophy of the time,' and this
work stands to-day as it did when it was
first published, as the cleverest, the ab
lest and the most forceful presentation
of the principles upon which that philos
ophy Is based.
The preface to the new edition (the
sixths, dated April 27, l!X>0. says: "In ten
days more forty years will hÂ«ve passed
since the liist Irr.rs of â¢ tills work were
written. Nothing was done to it until
1SG7. when a further development of it?
Icad'ng conception necessitated reorgan
ization of ihe second part. In 1ST5 some
changes were made in the chapters on
â¢The Indestructibility of Matter.* 'The
Continuity of Motion' and "The Persist
ence of Force.' more fully harmonizing â¢
the vitws set forth in them v.-ith the con
ception at that time reached. , Since then
there have been Introduced no alterations
v.orth mentioning."
The new edition makes many changes
of Illustrative passaged and contain?
many Improvement* in the form In which
the subject Is rretcr.teJ. ' In revising the
work afi-T so many years. Mr. Spencer
eays: "I am able to criticize my ex
position as though it had come from an
other. I discover a good rte::l of redu:i'*
ance. superfluous words, phrases, clauses'
and occasional paragraphs. The erasure
of these, while it has. I believe, conduced
to lucidity, has entailed considerable
abr!dg:ment; so tluit notwithstanding
many additions, the work is nuw dimin
ished by fifty pases."
Tho edition Is provided with~a striking
portrait of the author when 7Â«. ycanj old.

The Spiritual Significance.
In "The Spiritual Sijniiticanee" Lillian
Whiting gives us another of her so-called,
â¢'spiritualistic'' books. The title comes
fmm "Aurora Lieigh," where, she also
finds her keynote:
"If a man could feel, not one day in the
artist's ecstasy, but every. day. feast, fast
or working day, the spiritual signiticance
burn through the hieroglyphic of material
shows, henceforward he would paint the
globe with wings.". â . >. , Â¦ . -
She brings to her work most conscien
tious study and quotes scientists and lit
terateurs glibly. In the chapter "Pj;yehlc
Communication" she Kives full ' accounts
of interviews with her lifelong friend
(Kate Field) through Mrs. Piper, the me
dium employed by t'ae "Society f"r Psy
chical Research."' and she claims that
several members of that society, "such as
Professor William James of Harvard. Sir
William Crookes. F. W. H. Myers*. Pro
fessor SIdgwick of Cambridge (England).
Dr. Richard Hodgson and Professor Oli
ver Lodge, president of an English col
lege, unreservedly announce^thcir convic
tions that there Is intercourse between
those in the seen and in the unseen
worlds."
She believes it to be only a question of
time before the world shall see "the de
velopment/ of nan's psychic faculties.'
making each individual to enter directly,
without benefit of medium. Into communi
cation with those in the unseen world."
The aim of this book, as of all her oth
ers. Is to prove the close correspondence
between the developments of . modern sci
ence and spiritual law?. A constant sense
of the divine presence, she reiterates, en
nobles life lierp and brings us Into closer
relations vritrrthoFe in the spiritual world.

Simply by the power and spell of his hu

Jersey, under circumstances the most
matter-of-fact and realistic, the fairies
perform their strangest tasks and play
their most fantastic pranks with entire
convincingness. The boy who became' en

vivV:. The Fields of Dawn. .
* Considering a sonnet as a fourteen
line poem written in iambic pentameter
and rhymed according to diagram, many
sonnets are written, j Considering it as
a poem, few sonnets have appeared In
contemporary literature.
Lloyd Mifflln's new volume contains
some pages of the latter. For the most
part, "The Fields of Dawn" is more
studied than Inspired, but now and then
the true poetical feeling hides in the
formal lines. A touch of wistful sad
ness in many lines suggests itself as more
adapted to lyric form than to the stately
Bonnet. "The Dying Day," "Estranged,"
"Fettered," mourn even In their titles.
Neither is such a theme as the elder press
adapted to this form, as is evident in the
lines:.

A Hero of the Forecastle.
Every schoolboy is familiar with the
story of the sailor who bravely interposed
his own person between ' tho descending
scimetar of a pirate and the life of his
commander, Stephen Dccatur, In one of
the battles of the Trlpolitan war nearly a

Townsend Brady has given us many par
ticulnrs of the life of Reuben James, a
common sailor, who, having as a chila
been ,Â¦ befriended by, Stephen Decatur, fol
lowed that .great commander throughout
his naval fiareer. In his later years James
fell a-victlm to that besetting sin of the
sailor, drink, and was occasionally repri
manded by his superior officers. Once
during the twenties, while serving on the
corvette John Adams. Captain Dallas, his
-commander, determined to punish the old
sailor, and calling him up before al! hands
said: "Reuben James, you are a trouble
some old rascal, always getting drunk,
nnd 1 am going to make an example of
you. You are herewith disrated from the
position of, boatswain's mate to -that of
seaman." "Thank you, sir," said Reuben,
"for your high opinion: but,, if your
Honor pleases, I am only celebrating the
day when I saved Captain I>c'catur's life,
and I will promise not to get drunk again
except when f f?o on liberty." "Who will
go your security, sir?" said the captain.
Commodore Portor. who was walking tlie
quarterdeck, stepped forward and said:
"I will go his security, Dallas; a man
who saved Decatur's life is entitled to get
, drunk occasionally.'* (Published by D.

shrubs of Great Britain and Ireland. The

from photographs which have been used

where possible so that the descriptions
do not shut out people who have a heart

BOOK REVIEWS
AND LITERARY CHAT
4At the time of bis other vacation ha
went to England and to Scotland, to
France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
He was Intensely bored until he rot to
Rome. After going to the Vatican and
seeing the Pope, after visiting the great
art galleries and tha catacombs, Mr.
Pierce and some companions got into a
carriage and were driven through the City
of the Seven Hills and out Into tha coun
try.
Shanghai began to show deep Interest,
and some of his companions heard him
saying something like:
"It's fine; It's great; I had no Idea It
great rate. . He had a large amount of
money loaned out. and had big deposits
In many banks. Then he began, to branch
out. He started a bank in Galveston, and
he became interested in the building oC
a railroad from Galveston to Beaumont.
The bank enterprise did not prosper. A
year or so ago the bank went into liquida
tion. It paid dollar for dollar, but it is
an open secret that the undertaking cost
Shanghai a quarter of a million dollars.
That loss is small- compared with thÂ©
loss the cattle king sustained in his rail
road speculation. The road, known as the
Gulf and Interstate of Texas, was seventy
miles long until the 8th of September.
Now It is thirty-eight miles long. The
great storm tljat devastated Galveston
washed away thirty-two miles of the
road, and It ia almost a certainty that
the line will never be rebuilt. It cost
5700,000. Pierce owned the majority of the
stock and bonds. The road never paid a
dividend and as a railroad Is hardly
worth anything to-day.
In addition to his losses in the banking
and railroad lines Shanghai has within
the last few years been involved In seem
ingly" endless litigation. D. Sullivan of
San Antonio, formerly a minor partner
of the cattle-king, has been suing for an
accounting, alleging that the boolcs of
Pierce have been juggled. Hundreds oC
witnesses have been examined In this
case, thousands upon thousands of pages
of testimony taken and dozens of law
yers engaged.
The banking troubles, the destruction of
his railroad and the worries over the blgr
law case are beginning to affect Shanghai
Pierce's health and he Is no longer the.
robust, big-voiced man he used to J>a.
There was a time when he made so .much
noise when he talked that he startled
the natives, but that Isn't the case now.
From long life on the prairies he had
become accustomed to snouting, and it
was his boast that his voice. In hia or
dinary speaking tones, would carry naif
a mile. When Tie went to New York, to
Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis or any
of the big cities and entered the office of
a friend and began to talk crowds would
congregate in the street, thinking a great
row was going on inside, but now Shang
hai's voice, although still a roar. la not
of the tremendous volume- of- former
times. Neither la his ambition as vault
ing as In olden days. Now ha Is content
to close up his outside speculations and
confine his attention to his ranches and
his cattle, t . ._
That he lpves cattlo and loves the- plains
Is Illustrated by two happenings during
the two vacationsâ the only two he ever
took in his life. Once he went to the Yel
lowstone Park. He looked at tha great
mountains the massive trees, tha water
falls and the marvelous creations of na
ture, and he never had a word to say un
til one of the members of the party gald:
"Mr. Pierce, isn't this wonderful?"
"Wonderful!" snorted tha cattle king 1 . "I
wish to the devil the conductor would
etart this train for the prairies, so wÂ«
can see something."
than It is now. The boys would come In
from the .'range and .'shoot up* the town
regularly. There were lots of desperate
characters, j and life was held cheap.
After I got my money for my bunch of '
steers I found that 1 was being 'treed' by
three-men. They didn't make any -play -
during, the day, but I knew that during
the night "they determined to murder me.
I: had enough money in my pile to tempt,
any ; one. ,' I was comparatively a stranger,
in San Antonio, and had few friends here
upon whom I could depend. I didn't know
Just what |to do, but determined to meet
the situation calmly. The first opportun
ity that -developed I rounded up the three
men who were trailing - me and invited
-them to drink.. I acted like a good fellow
'with them for ah hour or more, getting
( them to drink all I could. Then I made
an appointment with them for the even-
Ing, and telling them I had some business
to attend to in the nature of collecting
some' more money due on my cattle I left
them. I went over to a place where I
knew a fellow had a thoroughbred horse.
I priced the animal and got possession
of him. Then I got aboard that thorough
breÂ«l-and I started out of town. Before
I had gone a mile my three friends.dis
covered what I had done and they began
to chase me. I never took my leg down
from that thoroughbred until the next
morning. When I did dismount I was
seventy-five miles away from San An
tonio. The three men who meant to rob
me followed roe all through the night.
They kept to my trail and they got warm
on It. the next day, but not until they
were well into the country where I be
longed. They were ambushed then."
"What became of them." Shanghai was
asked. .
"Really, now, I can't remember," the
big i man replied.
But Shanghai hasn't had the better of
all the adventures in which he has par
ticipated. He had an argument with an
Indian Territory cowman named Miller
a few years ago, and had it not been for
the intervention of friends Miller would
have killed Shanghai. Another time they
met on a train and Miller invited Shang
hai to get off the train with him, ride
out into the country a bit and have a duel
with Winchesters.
Shanghai told Miller he would see him
later.
He did see him later. It was in the Tre
mont Hotel in Galveston two years ago.
MlUer was a witness in a suit brought
by a banker named Sullivan of this city
against Pierce. Miller declared that he
wasn't going to leave Galveston until ha
had -Shanghai's scalp. Shanghai notified
the chief of police and the thief sent two
detectivesâ Murphy and Watersâ to act as
a bodyguard for the millionaire. Miller,
who appeared to have some humor, re
sponded by hiring two of the biggest ne
groes In town to accompany him wherever
he- went. For three or four days the two
detectives stayed with Shanghai night and
day and the two negroes walked with
Miller in and about the" hotel. Both Miller
and Pierce stopped at the same hotel and
the bodyguard fo/ce was the Joke of the
town. '

to sell a portion of their herds Shanghai

There was; a time a few years ago when
It seemed that Shanghai Pierce was going
to be the richest man In ' the Southwest.
His cattle holdings were immense, and his
lands Â¦Â¦ were . : appreciating In . value at a

"I thought Rome, the Eternal City, with
Its art treasures. Us historical associa

"Who's talking about Rome?" asked

""Weren't you?" asked his friend.
"No." replied Shanghai. "I was sayfnjr
.what a great country this would be out
here for cattle raisin?."
try along the Tres Palocios, gathered such
cattle as he could find and started once
more as a ranchman. It was slow work
for some years, but the tall young Yankee
was patient and persevering. Land was
cheap and cattle were cheap. The range
was illimitable, There were no fences.
The winters .- were mild, the cattle in
creased rapidly, and it cost little to live.
Cattlemen as a rule were Â¦ profligate.
The war left Shanghai penniless, but un
daunted. He returned to the prairie coun-

v.y.n the rear guard of every advance ai:d
the advance guard of every retreat while
he was in the army. However this. may
be. old soldiers say that Shanghai alwuys
had plenty of cattle In nls herd and the
soldiers never 'suffered for fresh meat
while he was with the .army.
He prospered amazingly and was con
sidered quite rich at the time the war
broke out. The war upset all of Shang
hai's plans. He couldn't dispose of flls
cattle, and with a threat of confiscation
of his 3^ock on the one hand and conscrip
tion on the other he determined to make
the best of a bad situation, so he entered
into a contract with the Confederate Gov
ernment to supply one of the armiea with
beef.
Old man Grimes thought that the brand-
Ing of mavericks was too easy a game
for his foreman, and he quarreled with
Shanghai. The tall young Yankee had by
this time learned enough about the cattlo
business to shift for himself, and he
parted company with nls employer and
branched out on his own account.
Before he had been with old man UrtraM
long he was selected as forenruui of the
gang. There was one thing about Shang
hai that soon became noticeable. When
"on the drive" with cattle his herd ln
creastd amazingly- Possibly Shanghai
was more successful In gathering the lost
and the strays than other foremen. Pos
sibly he knew where o iind the maver
icks. A maverick is an unbranded cow
or steer, and Shanghai was a wonder in
discovering cattle that bore no brand of
ownership.
For five or six years before the War of
the Rebellion Shanghai acted as foreman
for Grimes. Then, with Yankee thrift, he
began to buy cattle on his own account-
He had his own private brand, and when
It came round-up time he used his private
brand on a falr'shait of the mavericks
that were gathered.
When he got to Texas he had nothing
but the clothes on his back, a rugRÂ»U
frame, lots of energy and a determination
to succeed; He got work as a cowboy with
a man earned "Grimes, who owned a great
ranch extending from -Corpus Christ!
north to where the town of Cuero is situ
ated. It was in the Â«*arly llfties that"
Shanghai came to Texas. The country.
was wild in those days and a cowboy's
life was- full of hardship. Shanghai soon
showed the etuJT of which he is ma'lc.
He could ride with the best of the Mexi
can or Texas cowboVs. his Judgment of
cattle was excellent and he was . untirinc.
Abel H. Pierce was Lor;i in Rhode Islani
sixty-two years ago. When only a boy he
went to Tfsas. He was in search of ad
venture and a fortune. On account of h'.s
extreme heightâ he is 5 feet 4â he got the
sobriquet cf "Shanghai," and/it has 'clans
to him bo well that few persons know iiiu
Christian name, and Â£Â«Â» refers to hlmseif
os 'Shang," while many of his friends
lengthen it to "Shanghai Pete."
Texas has mar.y <j*ueer characters, but
none odder than Shanghai Pierce. He is
the richest of the cattlemen, the oldest \n
point of active service and the most en
terprising. A thousand good stories ast
told about him, some apocryphal, but th*
majority true. He is as â¢well known In
bar.klr.g circles In New York as on th;
prairies cf Texas, and the big moneyed
men of Chicago, St. LÂ»ouis and Kansas
City know him almost as well as do the
people of the larger towns of Texas.
Nothing is too big- for Shanghai to take
a hand In, be it a poicer game or a blini
pool in Wall 6treet. but the only thing he
prides himself on Is his knowledge of cat
tle. He says he is the best cowman >rÂ»
the world, and it would be difficult to
prove that he is wrong In his opinion. It
â¢was a chance meeting with Shanghai that
led Charles H. Hoyt to write "The Texas
Steer." They met on a railroad train. an3

around the Cattle King. Of course. Hoyt
took all sorts of license with his char

monument and st-ttln? ;t in place was not
easy, especially as the roads in that por
tion of Texas are none too good.
This monument is of marble and gran
ite, about thirty-five f< et high, and cost.
sÂ«t in place, about $13.')t0. The pedestal is
of Texas praEite. -while there is an heroic
figure cf "Shar.g" In marble surmounting
the whole. Smaller figures commemora
tive of stirring- events in his life are ia
niches about the pedestal, and panels are
chiseled with inscriptions, telling of Mr.
Pierce's career. As the cemetery at Dem
leg's Eridge is nearly thirty miles from
a railroad, the task of transporting the

erected to the :ncmory of A. H.
Pierce. Everybody in that portion or
T<xas knows that "S'.i^nphaJ." as A- 11.
Pierce is better known, is Ftill living, bet
that makes no difference. The monument
tells of the virtues rt Shanghai. The
statements are no dou->t true, for Shang
hai had them chiseled out of order.
"I'm not going to wait until I'm dca'l
to have a monument raised for me," said
Shanghai, in Â«-xpla.iring why he antici
pated the future. "You may talk as you
please about me now, but I don't know
what you'll say when I'm dead. I'm en
titled to a monument and I'm going to
make pure of having one. so I've put one
up In 'memory' of myr-cif."
â¢-So things went 'on year In arid year out- -
Other cattlemen complained, .but Shang
hai Pierce prospered; and Â¦ the longer he
worked the richer he became. There is
only one record of Shanghai making a
In these early days. That was
when he .got the. Kansas fever. He ,dis- '
, posed \ of all his Texas holdings", and with |
a lot of other South Texas .. cattlemen
migrated to Kansas.' One year there sat
isfied him' that he was in the wrong, pew.
He moved ' back to Texas, sadder and
about $100,000 poorer. ,He says now that
this one mistake made" a difference of
"$1,000,000 to him, for trie loss' of $100,000 at
thattime cut .him off from' profits later
that would have made up the larger sum.
Once back en the old ground Shanghai
again made money. .He had recovered all
. his losses "within a few years and again *
was rich. When the range began to be
fenced Shanghai vas one of the .first to
see the- necessity, for owning land. He
bought all that he could get in big strips
and managed to get some of the choices^
grazing lands In the low country between
Vthe Braz.os, San. Bernard, Caney. Tres Pa
laelos, Colora'do, Guadaloupe and San An
tonio rivers. Not*conte"rt with this, ho
bought *a* great' rantfh" In' the Indian" Ter- "
ritory.' \,
A few years ago when an. inventory of
Mr. Pierce's property was maÂ«l,e it â¢howeW
that he was. worth in: excess of $3,000,000.
That' was before .the big advance In cattle
and before the land was considered of any
value except' for grazing. Now the ap
praisement" on . the . same property would
probably double the figures.
But Shanghai Pierce. has not become a
millionaire without many thrilling adven
tures, and he declares that the making of
a fortune is simple and easy compared
with the task of keeping it. Many- a
nicht he slept on the prairie only to- awake
in the morning to find that rattlesnakes
. had crept into his blankets In the night
to get warm. Many a time he has faced
dcuth , at the* pistol point, but he seems
to bear 'a charmed life, anÂ£ although he
. has been shot at frequently and des
perate men have followed him with the
intention of murdering him, he has es
caped all the bullets that were intended
for him.
There Is one'story about Shanghai that
he never cares to hear. It relates. to a
battle with cattle thieves. .Shanghai was
the leader of the pursuing party, and
when, after a running fight, the thieves
surrendered it was discovered that the
robbers were cowboys who had formerly
worked on the ranches that had been
depredated.
The usual short, summary .trial was held
and the thieves were sentenced to be
hanged.
"Have you anything to say before you
die?" one of the cattle thieves was asked.
"Yes," he replied.
"What is it?"
"Well." said the cattle thief, "I'm guilty
and I guess I ought to be hanged, but
don't let 'Shang' hang me. I never got
the Itch for branding cattle until I went
to work for him."
Shanghai says this story Is a. creation
of his enemies, but whether It is true or

"Xow, then." said Mr. Bowser as all
was ready. "I take it that you feel cold?"
"W-e d-o!" replied the men In chorus
through their chattering teeth. . , â¢
"That Is splendid. I estimate that there

"It do, Sam; It do."

Bowser.
"It's â¢ my solemn cplnyun that yÂ«

Mr. Bowser was about to protest and
increase his cash offers when the two

from a back door, could see nothing: for

climbed the yard fence, and the household
went out to look for Mr. Bowser. There
were thousands of traces of him at hand,

6And then they went in to dinner and
prepared for their first nhrht In New
York. / GEORGE W. PECK.
"Me?" said the Bad Bov. taking a
roll of bills from hi* pocket. "I went
down to. Wall street and took a flyer in
sugar stock and cleaned up $300."
''Well, we are $260 ahead."* said the
old man. "Steer me onto this Wall
street game and I'll cive uo society."
"Well, by gosh, I have had a time!
First I met a gentleman whose uncle i3
president of our bank at home, and hr
remembered, when he was uo there two
years ago, going to my grocery with his
uncle and doin^ some trading with me.
I was sort of squeamish in Dclmonico'i.
he Â«aid it was. on Sixth avenue, and lie
looked ever to a round table not far
away, and, by gcewhillikens! he saw
his sister eating lobsters and he intro
duced me to her. My. but she was a
beauty, and the most tender-heartedest
girl I evej saw. She felt of my pulse and
said I needed some pepsin, because ths
water didn't agree with me. and she
said she would go out to a drugstore
and buy me some. She wanted to pay
for it herself, but I am too much of a
gentleman to allow that, so I cave her
$10 and she went out and and cot it and
came right back with the chance. The
pepsin bottle cost $o 80. but it was worth
it. Say, pepsin comes hich in this town,
don't it? After I took it I had a nice
nap and then we all three went to a
show. They left me at the show and
went home, up Fifth avenue, because
they were to have a dinner party, and
the show was no good and I went to
sleep in my sent, and when it wa3 over
the show people woke me up and told
me which way to go to meet up with
the hotel. I never went to a show be
fore where the actresses wore poke bon
nets and played tambourines and sane
hymns and charged $3 a seat. But I

they got through the show I'll be darned
if they didn't take up a collection in a
tambourine, and I found I didn't have
a cent. There must be a hole in, my
pocket somewhere."
"You are too easy!" said the Bad
Boy, and he laughed so the roof shook.
"You have been bunkoed. That man
never saw or heard of you before, but
just fooled you, and his sister was a
common canary who gave von knock
out drops, stole all the money they
didn't borrow of you. and took you to
a Salvation Army service and played it
on you for an opera at $5 a seat which
you paid to your new friends, and here
you are with your old 7-cent poefcet

possible."
"But what did you do all day?" asked
the old man.

the most interesting" experience. Come
on, old Hayseed!" and the Bad Boy put
on his overcoat and" gloves and was
ready.
"Wait till I stuff one of mv 7-cent
pocket-book3," sa"id the old man. as he
filled it with tissue paper, and the oM
man and the young man started out tor
experience.
The Bad Boy got back to their roonu
in the hotel before dark and waited for
the old man, and after awhile he hear.-l
a noise at the elevator, and going out in
the hall he tound the old man having
some words with the elevator boy. and
he finally, got him to the room an<I
asked him how he enjoyed himself. Ths
old man dropped into a rockine-chair
with a dull thud and said he was prettv
nearly bushed, and if he had a pepper
mint sling he thought he would be all
right. The boy ordered a couple of
cocktails, and after the o!d man had
drunk his cocktail and fished the cherry
out of the bottom of the class with hi*
jackknife he said:
"Well, we will go out prettv soon and
look over the town. I want to give you
some pointers on how to act while you
are here. This is the greatest town in
the world. Everybody 0 here tries to
make it pleasant for strangers. If you
see a carriage in front of a store or a
residence with a driver in Hverv and, a
footman and want to take a ride, iust go
and get right in the carriage and tell the
fellow with buttons on where you want
to go and who you are. Some days you
may be Chauncey Depew or Rockefeller

you are stick to it and they will take you

the old man looked wise. "I had a clerk

robbed, and they have got to get up

York?" \ . .-.'â¢'â¢Â¦'
"What did they do to you?" said the
Bad Boy, as he fingered' a Masonis
charm on 'his watch chain and made a
sign with his fingers.
I "Well, five or six of them took me to
a schoolhouse, and after takinz off the
most of my clothing they made me walk
around the schoolhouse in the snow
nine times, barefooted, and 4hen they
took me upstairs and rode me down the
stairs sitting :' down, Â¦ and every stair I
struck seemed to go right up to my hat,
right through me; : and they then took
me to the' ice on the river, tied a rope
around me and soused me in the water,
and then dried me by mauling: me with
box covers, . and then they blindfolded
me and took me on 1 a bridge across the
river after midnight and told me to co '
home, and I walked about a mile and
found I was in a graveyard. Say. wsfs
that Masonry or hazing?"
"Oh, that was Masonry all rightl' "
said the boy. They gave you the thirty-. .

"I got them to be robbed of." said the
old man, with a wink. "That girl who
took me for her Uncle Abner" got the
first one, and it was filled with tissue
paper. But while she was lying on my
shoulder there in the depot and taking
my pocket-book T was turning a little

end was full of cheap pocket-books.
"Well, sir, I was never more surprised

a bit of jewelry out of his pocket and
handed it to the Bad Boy. She rushed
up to mo and said, 'Why, Uncle Abner,
I am so glad to see you!' and she rush
ed into my arms, and I had to drop my
valise and hold her up. I felt her dear

man looked wise and rubbed his stubby

old groceryrr.an had arrived in
New York after their perilous trip
in the sleeping car, and the old man
had been trying to explain to the boy
th2t he <5:d not have any designs on the
woman into whose berth he had gone

man was sick his first thought was to

learned the trick of small quantities.
Dlgges was in an unusually good humor,
and Zella flattered him until the great
brute fairly posed as he lolled against
the saloon counter.
Rorty Jaggers and Rafferty Jones and
others chimed in, and they were a merry
party. Later Zella sat In at a game of
poker. She wanted to obtain possession
of Digges" knife. She might, perhaps,
have coaxed it out of him. In that, case
ehe would have felt handicapped. Sho
would like to win it from him or to ex
change it with her own.
Over the game when there was a jack
pot which ehe felt sure of winning she
said to her rival for it, who was Digges,
the rest having withdrawn: "I dare say
if I asked you to swap knives with me,
you would?"
"I reckon I might â or I mightn't."
"I'd like to have the knife as a trophy; a
knile that has become famous; that, in
deed, was famous to begin with. It would
be a nice souvenir to take home when 1
go."
"I've raised you ten dollars," was his
reply.
"I know," said Zella. "and I'm going
to raise ycu out oi your bootsâ lf I feel
liki it. But as I was saying "
"What are we playin'. youngster?" '
"Drawpoker, But there ain't no hurry.
I've heard of a game being postponed
ur.tll the next day, money and cards de
posited at the bankers. Now. look here,
Digges. don't be ugly. This is what I
want to say. I'll raise you my knife
against yours, with this understandingâ
that whichever takes the pot don't keep
the two knives, but exchanges."
"Exchanges, be damned!" said Digges.
"I raise you the limit, $20; and. on top o'
that, flings in my knife ag'en yours."
"You are very kind," said Zella, laying
down her knife.
"I'm a doggoned fool," he replied. "But
ef you'd asked me for it, by thunder, I'd
a giv' it you'."
He laid It on the top of Zella's and the
pile of bills and silver and gold, no very
serious amount, with a $20 limit.
"Then I call you, Abner Digges."
The other players and a. few lookers
on craned their necks over the board.
"What have you got, Digges?"
"I reckon that's a full king high!" lay
ing down his cards with an air of satis
faction.
"No good against four aces, Abner,"
said Zella.
"And you drew two cards! â you!" he
exclaimed, pushing back his chair and
rising from the table. " take such
luck!"
The air was sulphurous for a minute or
two, with a blasphemy that need not be
translated. Zella pocketed the pool and
thrust Dlgges* knife into her belt.
"Say, Digges, don't be angry," she said.
"You fehall have your revengeâ and you
muEt have my knife."
"Git!" said Digges. "Don't you come
nigh me. Git!"
â¢'What for? Is :t the money you re
gret? Then, hang it, take it!" And she
flung a pocketful back upon the table.
"Don't anger him. you young fool!" said
Rafferty Jones.
"Who cares about angering him?" she
said. "I don't want his tinpot knife, nor
his dirty bills!" .
She knew how fir she could go. It was
not the first tiff she had had with Digges;
nor would It be the last.
"Look here, boss, take my knife. That
was the bargain; I wouldn't have played
otherwise. And perhaps it is too bad to
collar your knife; take It back."
"Git! Before I bash you!" he said.
"Git! Gimme time! Don't you see. Gimme
time!"
"All right, boss," she said, stepping
aside.
"He'll get over lt.^with another drink;
give him time." advised Rorty Jaggers.
"All right," she said; and. taking out a
cigarette, sat down and smoked and chat
ted with the camp generally, and pres
ently sat in at another game.
It was at this point that Dave went to
the Gulch and told Dankes all that had
occurred; and Dankes stamped about the
cabin and in and out of the door, and
when Jim howled in sympathy at his heels
kicked at the dog. and then started off
down the trail, to bring Philip in.
"To think that one of his 1'arnin' and
style should spend his time with such a
vile crew!" he said. "By the heaven
that's above us. ef it goes on, he shall
quit! I won't see him ruined, perhaps
killed, in some row with Digges or an
other."
"Don't ppeak to me yet, dear old
friend. " she said, meeting: him halfway
up the trail. "I am not quite myself."
"Not quite yerself ? I should think ye're
not. cavoortin' wi' such scum!"
"It isn't that. Dankes. 1 don't quite
know how I feel."
"Had too much rum. p'r'aps."
"Solomon Dankes! \\ nat do you mean
by daring even to think of such a thing,
let alone to say It?"
"I've hear'd on yer boxin' and sparrin'
and yer high jinks, as my dear old pard
would say, and yer drinkin' with Dlgges
r.nd makin 1 him yer friend, and then
t^uarr'llin' with him, and then . But
thÂ«Â»re! Good Lord, I'm too durned mad
with yer for words!"
"I've gotten something here, Dankes,"
the said, in a hushed voice, "that should
set your thoughts in another direction."
"What have yer gotten? What's the
matter with yer?"
"I'm worn out, I think," she answered.
"1 should think so! Eh I didn't care for
yer and respect yer, and thin* mucn of
yer, would it matter to me a wooden nut
meg what yer did? Whether yer was
Digges' friend* or his enemy, or whether
ver stooped to his level, or others?"
"Stop! stop! dear friend; you don't
know what you're talking about. I'll ex
plain to you. Don't turn against me.
You'lJ be fonder of me one day than you
were of Ned Glover himself."
"Shall I! Well, they say miracles still
happens." - .-â¢ : c;
"You saw 'vour dear partner, the best
fellow that ever lived, slain "
"More's the pity, I did: and by the very
man you're "
"That will do," said Zella.' "I'm In no
humor to bear more in that vein at pres
ent. Here is the knife that robbed him
of life. Take it, and go and kill his mur

loved him so. . . . Ah, an! I thought
that would touch you up. . . . Don't
get In my way. . . . I'm Just a bit
crazy myself to-night!"
She ran past him and never stopped un
til ehe entered the cabin. Then she flung
open the door, rushed to her own room,
fastened herself in, flung herself upon the
bed, and lay there motionless for an hour.
"WaB Mx. Grey drinkin' anythin',
Dave?" -.---<
"No; no mor'n Just as he doea here;

"Then, what's the matter with him?"
"Can't tell. Seemed lively enough, and

"Seems quite crazy, to my thlnkln',"
said Dankes. '*j
"They say genuses is that way," said
Dave. "Never aaw but one genus, and
that was Bunco Sam, as nayther mule nor

"So long as you ain't mad with me, It
don't signify."
"Not at all, dear old Prudent."
"Then I kin say mornin'. Mister Grey,
and feel kinder happy. . There's a letter
as I'm leavin' on the table. I've b'en
a-spellin 1 through it. There aint nawthin'
that's private in it; you can read it. If
you feels disposed that ways, and advise
what I've gotten to say by way. of, an
swerin' of it. It's from "Richard Lotri
mer of London, Ned Glover's friend.
"Very well, thank you, dear friend,"
said Zella. "Pull the door to after you.
Where's Dave?"
"He's out wi' Jim, after the mule.
There's a feller comin' to buy It, since
you don't want to keep it."
"That's all right. I shall give Dave the
money. Good morning. Don't keep sup
per waiting when you come home."
She raised herself on her elbow and lis
tened. The doer was shut. She heard
Dankes moving off down the trail. Then
she slid from her bunk/ drew on her
breeches, unfastened her door, and, en
tering the general' room of the cabin, car
ried off the letter Dankes had spoken of,
and climbed' back into her berth. .
The letter was more of a private letter
than one of a legal character. It was
written on the noteheading of the firm of.
Straker. Love & Lorrimer: but it was
signed "Richard Lorrimer, and it was
addressed to Solomon Dankes Esquire.
It bore numerous postmarks, and had
come by hand from the Forks, where let
ters for the Valley were left, to be called
for. The mule wagons and the pack
mules from time to time brought in any
letters addressed to the Gulch or the
Valley. It had been a long time on the
road.
"You are, I understand, my friend, Ed
win Glover's partner. He has, in your
keeping, certain stock in the Gulch enter
prise, certain stock in the Platts Valley
MIr.es (the last-named endorsed to him by
Hiram Dexter), certain moneys in specie
and a certain quantity of gold dust and
nuggets. I am writing this at his request,
in case he does not survive an encounter
that has been forced upon him, he says,
from which he feels that he will not come
out alive. Glover is my dearest friend.
Next to me, he Is attached to you; and
has the fullest confidence Jn your hon
or and good faith. He has forwarded a
copy of his will, which, he tells me. has
been duly executed, and- is In the hands
of his Chicago lawyers. He bequeaths all
his possessions, existing and that may
come to him hereafter, to his fiancee, Zel
la Brunnen, of ihe Boarding House, Park
side, Chicago; and you and Mr. Storey, of
the Chicago Dally Mail, are nominated
as her trustees. Glover has previously
written to me of his engagement to Miss
Brunnen, and the happiness it gave him;
and, if hia instinct as to the encounter
he speaks of has misled him. and he lives,
I shall hope to welcome him and his wife
in London; if, peradventure. he is dead â
which God in heaven forbidâ I shall de
sire to see her in town all the same, since
no one else can so well assist her in car
rying out Glover's wishes, not simply in
connection with his estate, but probably
as to her future. It Is a very strange
thing for me to write this letter, meet
for either fortune; but I am simply act-
Ing on the very strict and urgent direc
tions of my friend. You will be good
enough to cable me If, alas, you are the
surviving partner; lf not. you will hand
this letter to my very dear friend."
Zella arose and dressed herself; unfas
tened her trunk, took out Ned's picture,
kissed it. replaced It, flung open the door,
looked out across the trail, listened to the
music of the summer air, humming vrith
insect life, and watched a' brace of butter
flies of many hues dancing in the sun.
It was all very beautiful.
The barking of Jim roused her. The
terrier came bounding out of the bush
right of the trail.
'.'How are you. Jim?" she said, in a
dreamy, far away kind of voice.'
Jim licked the .hand that had patted
his head, then bounded down the trail, to
return with Dave at his heels.
"Mornin', Mister Grey. . The boss is
havin' a deal of business. Here's a cable
dispatch for him, and another letter: they
come with the other, but barman at the
saloon thought as he'd sent 'em with the
fust letter."
"A cable?" said Zella. "That looks im
portant."
"Won't you open it, and see?"
"No, I think not, Dave."
"Ain't you his pard?"
"You had better go and find him, Dave.
He's gone first to the mill, and then, he
said, he would have to go over to the
Ridge." ,
"But you ain't had no breakfast?"
"Don't mind me, Dave. Go, straight
away. Say" that I have read the lett-*.- he
left for me and will help him to answer
it; and that if, when he. has read this'
other letter and the cable', he would like
me to read them, you will bring them
back. I am having a day off; shall be
about the cabin all day."
"Yes, mister," said Dave. "I see you
glv it old man Dlgges; you just busted
him! *,
"Think so. Dave?"
_ "He'll be goin' on a bender to-day, and
be tearin around for the rest of the
week."
"I have never seen him the -worse for
drink.

he gits on at times. Pete Kerridge was

"Is that so? Well, never mind. Dave
Go now and find the boss and give him tho
letter and the cable."
"Yes. mister." %
"And when Is there another mule train
to the Forks?"
"Startln' now," said Dave.
"Do you think there's time for me to
send a message?"
"Why, yes. I'll catch 'em Up."
"Then please wait one moment."
She sat down and wrote upon a sheet
of note paper, addressed: "From Solomon
Dankes to Richard Lorrimer Esq., Messrs.
Straker. Love and Lorrimer, Bedford
Row. London, England: Alas! Glover's
instinct waa fulfilled. I sent the news to
Zella Brunnen, and hear she or her repre
sentative has started for London."
"It'll come to a main heap o' dollars "
said Dave. "Ain't it?" ; -
Zella counted out the money.
"At the Forks they will copy It out on a
proper form."
"But. lord lord. Mr. Grey, you'll find
the kerrect thing in your room, under the
papers on the shelves. Mr. Glover was
used ter send cables. I kin find 'em "
Zella stood and watched the lad as he
opened her room door and went to the
shelves -and produced the forms. She
thought Bhe had turned over everything
but at anything in the shape of letters of
documents she had paused, with feminine
delicacy, and so had overlooked the cable
forms.
She rewrote the message, and then, hav
ing another form handy, considered
whether she should send one to Chicago
They would have been expecting to hear
from her from the Gilsey House; even
from Liverpool or Southampton by this
time.
"Better wait and see what the letter
and cable for Dankes may contain," she
said to herself: then addressing Dave sho
said: "Thank you, Dave; now, away you
go." '.';:;.â¢ ' . ,
And away he went, Jim bounding on In
front, Zella watching them out of sight
and then re-entering the cabin to read
over afresh the strange, fateful letter
from Richard Lorrimer.
DANKES APOLOGIZES
Dankes was up early the next morning.
He had had a bad night. Zella had not
elept well. Dankes felt remorseful. Zella
was resolved to have her eight hours'
fcleep. She was in training for her tragic
enterprise. Her latest effort of active
diplomacy and the capture of Digges'
knife had tired her.
"Ain't yer goin' ter git up, Mister
Grey?" Dankes asked at her door. "I
hear'n yer a-stlrrln'i or I wouldn't ha'
spoke."
"No. I'm going to have & day Â¦ off,"
she said.
"I'm away to the mill," said Dankes;
"and I guess I've business at the Ridge.
I wont De back afore supper'tlme."
"Very well."
"Reckon I waa mad last night. Hope
you won't think any more 'bout what I

Zella took it front him, felt the blade,
passed it from ' one - hand Â¦ to the other:
held It lightly, manipulating, it with her
fingers, as If It had been a mere fan;
tossed it up. caught it; gripped the haft

He took It up by the haft, drew It from
its case and tried Its temper. ~ Â¦

"You would ef you'd seen It; but not

"Thank you, mister; the ruv-nor told

"Really? . I'm sorry."

"I don't know a* 'he knows what he

"Yes; and he said as he of ten - thought

"Oh! He thinks I'm making up to Dlgges

"Well, you see, It's like tale-bearin', as
they say; but I ain't a mean cuss", so
what's It matter, ef it's like this or the

"I wonder what's yer game, mister, with
Boss Dlgges? It ain't for me to take a

he's puzzling hisself a good deal 'bout
you and Digges."
"Is he, now? Sit down and tell me,
Dave." -.
"To have some fun."
"I hope not. for the present. Dave; but
you never know, as you say. By the way,
I think I shall go down to the Valley,
Dave," she said thoughtfully.
"What for?"
"Dave," paid Zella, suddenly Interrupt
ing him, "when I leave the Gulch, as some
day I shall, you'll find, on the shelf where
you keep the cable forms, a few dollar
bills to help you see San Francisco
through still more radiant glasses."
"Hope you ain't goin' to leave us?"
"He sleeps all dav. and is busy goin'

It's just heavenly. And thar's the sea!

"Oh! he don't want no company; and
Â«he don't trust some of the Platts Valley

"How long have you been here, Dave?"
"What, In Platt's Valley?"
"Yes." - t
"Oh! I reckon from the fust. Come over
with Mister Dankes."
"Where from?"
'"Way back of San Francisco."
"Why don't you sleep up here?"
"I . looks after the mill; got diggin's
down thar."
"I should have thought you â¢ would have
been company for Mr. Dankes." ' â¢'
"Do you think It's true?"
"And yet he's the boss in the Valley?"
You see, he's such a tough? got such a
wrist, and. the pluck of forty. Why, he'd
think no more of flghtin' a rlgment than
eatin his supper. They say he -' killed a
Marshal and a hull posse 'way beyond
San Francisco, five year back, afore he
come out here."
"Digges? Why, they say he'll be a mil
lionaire, one day. He's got a millionaire
for a backer. That's one of the things
Mister Dankes could never understand
how Mister yiram Dexter, the great
banker, could have deals with Digges; as
big a thief. Mister Grey, as big a lyin'
sneak as there is this side the Sierras."
'.'The boss says they're of no import
ance," said Dave, as he handed letter and
cable to Zella. "But thar's a hi' jinks
a-goin' on, as Mister Glover used ter say.
down at the Platts Valley camp. I told
you how -it would be. Boss Digges, h's
started In on a bender. Entire camp's
out on the spree. They've even stopped
tne mill. Yo-u can't cuess what a day
they re havin'. Boss Digges is sparriti'
with the gloves and thar's be'n a race be
tween Jumper Bill and Frenchy Nick for
a jar of whisky: and old Jake Sharp and
Frenchy have had their foils out; and
It s a regular sportln" day. I never see
anythin' like it. And the boss, he keeps
a-sayin' 'Whar's that dude. Mister Grey?'
Rorty Jaggers says for a dude you've got
the biggest muscle he ever felt grip a
man with. I didn't know as you'd nipped
Rorty. Whar's Old Prudent? they wanted
to know. I told 'em he was at the Ridgii
and would be there all day."
"And will he, Dave?"
"I guess so. He and the boss thar is
havin' a deal, I. think, about a new claim."
"Is Mr. Â¦ Car>tain Dan dovwn at the
saloon?" Â¦
"Yes. He's doin' a bit of chaff all round.
He s good company, ain't he?"
"Very. And a good fellow, feh, Dave?"
"I should smile. Why. there ain't a man
in the Valley as wouldn't take his word
for anythin' ; and yet he ain't supposed
to be what they calls warm."

The letter was on a matter of ordinary
business,, connected with some goods
Dankes had. ordered from Denver.
with strength. Once she would have liked
to have said, "What does that remind
you of, you brute?" But she reserved her
taunts for a more serious time, and when
the serious time should come she would
r.o doubt be sufficiently occupied with the
wprk . in hand to think of nothing else.
_^She was disappointed with the result of
Dankes' reading of the letter and the
cable. She had a vague kind of hope that
they might contain some news of Bridget
U'Hagan or of Mr. Storey. She found her
self thinking, between other things, of the
letter from Richard Lorrimer. He hoped
to see her. He should. - It would be a
comfort to her to have him talk about
her dear Ned. Already her mind began to
be occupied ' with London. â¢ â¢ â¢ Would
ehe ever see London?

Zella threw her gloves aside, took up
her knife, that haa been Digges', un
sheathed it, and stood on the defensive-

She awaited him, clutching the weapon!

Dlgges had never as much as touched
her.
As he threw the bottle aside he again
splutterlngly invited the camp to drink at
his expense. \
"Nevah seen yo' in so fine a mood!"
exclaimed the captain.
"When you've filled up." said Digges,
"me and my friend. Mister Grey's goin'
ter shew you a sample of the noble art. of
self-defense. Rorty, whar's the glovesf
Rorty produced several pairs of gloVes
with, a "Here y'are, boss!"
"Don't yo' think yo' should ask Mlstah

most Southern manner.

"It's called fo'. sah, whenever I chuse to

"Gentlemen, gentlemen!" said Jaggers.
"Oh, him!" grUnted Digges, turn
ing 1 away.
"I'm quite ready to oblige, comrades. If
the Boss Is In the humor for it," said
Zella.
A general cheer greeted Zella.' s accommo
dating remark, and almost immediately a
ring was formed and .Zella and Digges
took their positions.
Digg-es stripped himself to his shirt
and breeches, and it was noticed, with
surprise, that his shirt was whiteâ "had
been fresh boiled," as one of the men
remarked, and yet they'd "neither coolie
nor female on hand." Digges had washed
his shirt.
"Hello," said Captain Dan. "To* shames
the camp. The first boiled shiri we've
seen!" â¢ -
"Seem'd as ef I'd like ter be a sorter
dude myself on this occasion. Can't a
man be dressv ef he pleases? Look at
Mister Grey: done up for a tea-party. I'm
goin' ter take the tea-party out'n you,
youngster, to-day."
"Very likely," said Zella. "Come one!"
Digges had hardly souared himself and
stood on guard before Zella danced round
him and hit him twice in the face, to a
roar of laughter and applause.
"No. yo' don't!" said the Captain, who
elected himself umpire, as Digges started
to follow Zella up.
Being an informal set-to it was not
considered necessary to have seconds
Captain Dan seemed all at once to be
seconds and umpire in one.
"Look here. Captain, no nonsense
Bbout this thing. Jaggers, second me.
Pete, ef Mister Greys wlllin', you stand
by him. said Dlgges.
"I am' willing." said Zella.
."And we'll have the ropes, and do the
thing In ordah. gentlemen," chimed in
the Captain. "Mistah Digges is on his

Zella smiled and looked round to see.

"Where's Dankes? ' Zella asked him.

"That's right," said Zella. recalling the
fact that he had supported Glover when,
on that fatal day. on Â¦ this very sp- 1 .
Glover had fought with Digjres. She did
not want the presence of Dankes an a re
minder. She was Philip Grey, and she
meant to goad Dlgges into a, serious en
counter before she left the ring.
"Time!" said the Cantain.
Dirges straightened himself to his full
height: a formidable looking opponent,
broad of chest and back, his shirt, being
open, showed a coating of thick hair; his
arms wero long and similarly covered,
though In a lesser degree; his forehead
low, his neck thick, typical of strength
and brutality. His opponent was the per

that the captain had said over and over
again ought to be modeled. The voung
ster's chin was full and betokened firm
ness, and there was a gleam of some
thing in his eyes that, to Captain Dan,
was more than earthly. Zella laid aside
her gloves, her hat. her knife and her re
volver, and tucked up her sleeves to the
elbow. |

, ; '.'Why. shrivel my bones, her* y'are!

claimed Digges, sweeping the captain's

He picked up a tumbler and the first
bottle -of -wine" that was opened and
filled a. bumper for Zella.
-"Captain Dan, 'scuse me, this is the
stuff for gentleman of the army.",
"He filled - another . glass to overflowing
for Captain Dan. ./Â¦
"Yo 1 are up in the skies," said the cap
tain." "What Is it? Struck a new lead?"
:"No; a new liquor," said Dlgges, putting
the bottle to his mouth and draining the
rest of; the contents.
"Bully for you!"."Hr\ hi*, for the boss!"
and "Who said he was mean?" and other
cheery cries greeted the announcement;
and forthwith the bartender. began to let
the -corks fly.' Â¦â¢" - -"
Then it was that Dlgges saw Zella and
Captain Dan at the further corner of the
bar.
"Hello! my dandy, my dude down-
Easter, rigged out fo' a mash! Pity ther'
ain't no dainty female to respond. Why,
Mistah Grey, glad ter see yo . Shouldn't
wondah you're fo' a day off, like the rest
of us?"
"Guess again, and you would be wrong,
Captain Dan," said Zella.
"Yo 1 are the author of. the high jinks;
yea, yo' are! Yo' fired the Boss with such
an extravagant desiah fo' sport that he
set all the camp movin'. We've had box-
In' and racin', and, by Jove, yo' might
have thought yo'self in old Kentucky, ef
yo'd seen Frenchy Nick and Ole Dutchy
Franz turn to with the foils; and then
Boss Dlgges with the bowie. He's been
a-sending messengahs aftah yo', sah!"
"Indeed!"
"Yes, sah, indeed. He's in what Hamlet
called a holiday mood; and would fain
have yo' try a bout with him. Between
yo" and me, Mlstah Grey, Boss Dlgges
is not always sweetest when most he pre
tends; or drunkest when most he lurches
on his pins. â¢ Come- here, youngster."
The giant thrust his arm under Zella's
and walked aside, out of hearing.
:, ."Take this from me: I'm. Interested in
yo* sah. - Boss Digges bears yo' ill will:
You don't love Boss Dlgges. I haven't

world without takln' It in, sah. He's Jeal

about . his science, and when I ventured
to chime In with the remark that In part
in' - with i his knife he'd given away his
luck he got mad and him and Â¦ me nigh

"Thank you. Captain Dan. If I should
want a friend badly to-day will you stand
by me?" Â¦Â¦ â¢ -.Â¦ â¢
"Will I? By the blessed home of my an
cestors, sah. I'll stand by yo' agen the
entire camp! Come and have a drink."
As they entered the bar the faro party
came noisily out from the back. Dlgges
at their head, all talking at onceâ some
cursing, some laughing; the winners Jubi
lant ."the losers down on their luck.
'.'Come od, boys," fc shouted Digges. "The
Forks hev sent us*, case of champagne,
and. by thunder, I'm goin' ter call the
lot!""
As Zella lounged into the arena, as it
might well be called, Captain Dan rose to
greet her.
They had rlssed up an awning over the
front of the saloon. Captain Dan, who,
had he' been dressed in woman's clothes,
might have passed for a blonde giant,
was sitting smoking in the shade of the
ship-like rig, watching a game of poker.
In which Pete Kerridge and Rorty Jag
gers. Jumper Bill and two others were en
gaged. Â¦ Inside the, saloon a lively faro
bank was in operation. In front of the
saloon the place, or "piazza," as Frenchy
Nick called it, had been swept and sand
ed, and there was evidence of sport hav
ing already rumpled it. The ropes and
posts used for the ring when serious busi
ness was on hand were lying In a corner.
SKIRMISHING
CHAPTER XXXVI.
This was, probably, the' last time sh<*
would stand there, among the pines ani
brushwood, on the threshold of the cabin
that had given her shelter, -where the
man she had loved had spent some happy
days, working for her, talking of her,
dreaming of her. It had given her many
a heartache to be sitting where he had
sat, to be lying in tne bunk where he
had lain; and at times it- had inspired
her with a strange, vague pleasure. . ,-
All her young life passed before her, as
she stood on the borders of the ' f oreÂ«t
primeval, and on the -ringe of what may
some day be a great city, rivaling Carson
and Denver. The Indian frontier, with
fading recollections of the old fort and
the music of the military bugle, the
school, wnere ehe had been unhappy; the
home with her aunt, where her soul had
revolted at the cant of a queer, crabbed
religious discipline; her revolt, and tha
peace of Parkslde, dear old Bridget O'Ha
gan, Old Glencoe, and the coming of her
English lover; she saw the sunny shores
of the lake, the sandy cycle track, with
two flying figures spinnlnsr along;; she saw
her centerboard boat, with its lugger sail,
her lover hauling the rope, herself snugly
ensconced behind tne rubber ;bar, watch
ing and secretly loving him; she felt the
jar. of her last encounter with Dexter:
she saw Storey's anxious face, charged
with the sad news of her lover's death;
she- saw herself Interviewing the police,
the Press, her lawyers, with no prospect
of Justice being done to her martyr, and.
finally, she saw herself rise up. heroical
ly,- to take upon herself what she con
ceived to be a great duty of vengeance.
\ It was a dramatic panorama of events
that passed before her. She had invoked
it In a . diagnosis of her position. She
was mentally climbing tho hill of her des
tiny, by way of justifying her latest as
cent. Had she mistaken the trail? Waa
she, on the right road? More than once
it had seemed to her that she was not
herself:, that she was traveling through a
strange, dream; that she had never been
Zella Brunnen, but always Philip Grey.
Bilf these fancies came during transient
momenta, in the cloud of a cigarette, or
even under the passing .influence of an
extra sip of old rye: at no time taking
more than enough to give color to the
fresh water she always drank with it.
"one of his durned .British peculiarities,"
they said In the camp. But now she was
serious and eminently herself. She had
looked back over her life and found noth
ing in it to regret that she could have
altered; except the death of Ned Glover,
and she blamed herself for letting him
go away. As if it were given to any hu
man power to arrest the hand of fate!
Presently she went to her room end
made a careful change of clothing. She
laid aside her ordinary gray shirt and re
placed it with one both lighter in ma
terial and in color. She laid aside- her
braces and- donned a broad belt that she
generally wore when she engaged in trials
of strength or dexterity. It was a soft
suede belt,' of unusual thickness consider
ing its pliability, with a buckle admirably
.qontrived to adapt itself to the ngure,
partly made of steel chain and silver. Bhe
changed her boots for a pair that looked
much heavier than they were, pliant in the
upper parts and giving well in the soles,
such as a cyclist might wear for scouting
in '.wartime; strength, with ductility. She
tucked her breeches, into the tops, giving
her nether limbs the characteristic touch
of the mining camp: and, that the boots
might. not look too clean and "dandy," as
Dankes had styled them, she muddled
them; at the bench- outside the cabin.
her throat she wed a loose gray
neckerchief; in the left back pocket of
her .breeches she thrust a small revolver.
She pushed her short hair back from her
forehead; pulled on, at the back of her
head, the felt cowboy looking hat, and
was a perfect picture of handsome, ath
letic yotuifj manhood.
At nrst she thought of carrying her knife
in the breast pocket of her jacket, where
the Southerner advised her to wear it;
but. supposing she tried a boxing bout
with Diggos it might incommode her, or it
might even be jerked out. so she fastened
It in her belt. Then, calmly surveying the
room she closed the door and passed out
into the open. Taking her way down tho
trail, her lips tightly closed over . her
white teeth, her blue eyes looking out
from. their depths with a steady gaze, un
shadowed from the sun by their long
lashes, the face calm In Its expression of
a fixed resolve, as of a general going into
battle.
"I am going to the saloon. Dave. If
there's so much fun going on, It's a pity
not to see some of It."
"Do you want, to have another bout
with Digges? He says he's goin; tobe as
spry with the gloves as he Is with the
bowie... If, Master- Dankes was here, he
wouldn't like you to go down there now."
"I .am going down because he is not
here, :Dave. I may need a , friend. . Keep
your eye on me, Dave.-,
- His hand. on his hip-pocket.' Dave said,
"Ef any harm comes to you, Mister Grey.
I'll let daylight into Boss Digges,; sure! 1 '
It: was a blazing hot day. Not sultry.
There was a slight breeze. It came, from
the. hills, in: gentle puffs; too furtive and
soft to ; do .much more than make the
heart pulsate. The singing birds, none of
which at any time had more than a few
vague -notes, had ceased to punctuate the
hum of insect life with staccato reminis
cences of some previous existence. The
silence was. profound. Zella stood con
tomplating the scene before her. She
listened for the last indications of Jim's
cheerful bark and Dave's responses.
"Abner Dlgges, I pronounce that a
foul." said the Southerner. "Persisted in.
I'd have shot you in your tracks."
A shout of approval greeted the um
pire's Judgment.
"An accident of the game," said the
baffled ruffian, "and counts."
"A. foul!" exclaimed the Southerner.
"And a low thingr to do."
Dlgges suppressed the curses that wera
bubbling to his lips in face cf the general
support of the umpire's emphatic, not to
say insulting declaration.
"X say it was an accident." repeated
Digges. "and, by , It's got to go at
that!"
"And that's, the end of it." said Jag
gers.
"Anothah such an accident, sah." "a!i
the Southerner, "will be settled by the
Recording Angel, you bet your life:"
Zella leaned against Dave, and breathing
hard for a fev.- seconds recovered thÂ«Â»
shock of the incident and took careful
note of the fact that before Digges re
sponded slowly to the "Time gentlemen!"
of the captain, he twice passed his kn'fa
from one hand to the other. This might
mean a trap for her. or it might mean a
certain forsetfulneps of all the hints he
had given her In their practice. Their
rounds with the gloves had not tended to
that calm repose wihlch he was accus
tomed to show on occasions of serious en
counters. Ii had hitherto been notieeabla
that Dirges had entered the arena steady,
watchful, vigorous. pulling himself
together, straightening his lumbering
figure and looking formidable from hia
very stolidity.
The encounter with Zella was. however
a sudden thins; the sequel to a quarrel
while his words were hot and his brain
in a whirl of an?w. That the sympathy
of the fr.ivd. even those of hia own par
ticular paia. had turned against him. only
served to make him desperate, which
might be to the advantage of Zella, or
ctherwlso. Anyhow, she seemed to gau?Â»
h.s mocd, and to be prepared for him
nowever he might attack, fair ortouL
The captain watched her keenly. It had
been in his mind to stop the fight on the
foul; but something told him that the
match was not the unequal encounter
that some of the crowd were inclined to
regard it. He observed how quickly tho
youngster leaped out of danger, even on
the stumble, and how. after a % passing
tremor, he recovered from the shock of
it. and at the same time took in his calm
smile of confidence, his nerve, the perfect
symmetry of his form, and the apt way
in which he avoided every dangeroua
move of his opponent. "As if It was an
avenging angel, by thundah!" he eaid to
himself, and drew nearer the combatants
now that they were once more at fence "
Zella. with her alertness, had an intel
lectual superiority that counts In fencinr
whatever the weapons may be. Her ob
servation was acute in the extreme. She
saw every movement, even before It was
made; and she knew her adversary's fa
vorite mode of attack, which, she was
now convinced, meant that rapid char.sra
of right hand to left which had hlthertÂ©
won him his victories. She had not
loosened the strap on her wrist, except
kÂ°ni?e V waVf U ree Play: *Â° W "^ that hls
To Dlgges the chief idea of the art o<
fencing lay In the weight of the body at
the psychological moment, the length of
arm and the force of a hit. The British
expert with the gloves at Chicago had
taught Zella that unless the mind be en
tirely engaged bodily strength Is of little
avail; and so had the Southerner at the
gymnasium, who. explaining something
of the uses and abuses of the koife. point
ed out to her that it waa alertness, the
trained eye. the interpretation of the very
thought of the foe that brought the duel
ist home with his blow at the right mo
ment and In the right place. "It don't
take much strength." he had said "to
puncture a man's heart; the thing is to>
strike the right place and at the right
second; if you are so inclined you can
make it Just as tho probe of a lance; It
doesn't want the stab of the butcher, bat
the prick of the artist."
Zella had laid all this to heart and she
had been greatly encouraged by the way
in which she had been able to punish
Dlgges with the gloves. He came at her
now. In this last round. Â«rt:h the persplr*
tion pouring down his face, his mouth
half open, showing his black and broken
teeth, and he came at her slowly, affect
ing a contemptuous languor; the cat and
the mouse business that Zella had been
told of in his previous encounters. But
she saw a gleam of intensity in his eyes
and the twitching of his fleshy lips that
argued a sudden rush.
As they met again Zella held the knife
between her thumb and two fingers, as if
it might have been a rapier; held it al
most jauntily. He gripped hts weapon
low and stiffly approached her slowly,
pushed his blade at her stealthily. ShÂ«
caught it on her point, with an almost
seeming playfulness, and glided past him.
threatening hia left guard. Not that they
had any guard except their own bare
a EP?J no , nonsense of arm
shields or cloaks for Digges and hia
camp; so that none of their encounters
were of long duration. Heenan. In the fa
mous Anglo-American battle, broke Say
era' arm in almost the first round. It
was no uncommon thing in the Platts
Valley encounters for a man ta be dis
abled right away: and thus, one-armed
for all practical purposes, to be with
drawn by his backers, and the fight
ended, "honor satisfied."
Neither Digges nor Zella had found any
opportunity to strike as yet, and Dlg^ea
had resolved to push the business, in this
second bout, to a finish. It did not looic
like it to the crowd: h'e was so gingerly
and careless, as it appeared to them
But when most he was edging from Zella
or elaborating his attack as if rather for
show than for practical effort, he was
preparing to take ground for a desperate
spring and lunge that should rip hia ad
versary to death. ,
Zella saw this, and was never durinff
the encounter more calm and collected
"Lemme 'stand by yer." Bald Dave,
dodging under the rope that had one*
more been stretched for the encounter.
' 'Come outer that!" exclaimed Jaggers*
"No; let him remain," said Zella; nÂ«

- "And by the Lord." said Dave. "I will
agen' all coders!" â
He spoke w ixC a whisper, and Zella
thanked him. . _. _
Then Pete Kerridge fomented, further
discord by suggesting that an umpire
should be a man who had shown no lean
ing to one side or the other; whereupon
Captain Dan said, anyhow, there was
enly going to be one umpire on this event
ful occasion. " . Â¦â¢''Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦' _.
"Ain't that playin* a highhanded gamer
asked Kerridge. ; c. ...
"If you think, in your shriveled heart,
sah that a man can't be honest and still
be human: if. sah. you are of opinion that
an umpiah should be an automatic ma

"I'm not one to etand in the way or

"O'let it go'" "Back down, Xerndge!
"Captain Dan's the umpire!" and other
encouraging remarks came from the
crowd: and the captain, removing hia
broad -brimmed felt hat. with a mock
flourish, said. "MlsUih Kerridge. the
camp's agen 1 you. sah; if you want a fur
ther judgment. I will aeÂ« you latah.
Pete Kenidge shrugged his shoulders.
and made way for Jaggers and Jumper
Bill, v.-ho marked the ground, carefully
watched by Captain Dan; and the tight
Zella. pale and confident, stepped within
the zone. , Â«'li
"Will you shake, gentlemen? asked thm
umpire.
"Nary a shake for me." said Dlffges.
"I'M give you a shake that will last
yon." said Zella.
She felt it a gain to Irritate her adver
sary; and she was as certain of kllllnj
him as if she had received a flat for the
work direct from heaven.
They maneuvered. The Southerner
noticed, with a smile of satisfaction, that
Digges lacked the self-restraint that bad
hitherto characterized him when In the
ring. He seemed to be In a hurry. The
youngster watched him with a steady
eye, and held his knife with a grace that
was snake-like, he thought; seemed to
balance it between his fingers, as If with a
certain kind of contemptuous ease. Dlgges
never once tried to trifle with the young
fellow. He was in brutal earnest. He
approached the youngster savagely. The
youngster gave way, and kept him at
arm's length, with a subtlety of defense
that he recognized as one of his own deft
inventions. Once he flung out one of hia
long arms, and almost touched her cheek;
but she dodged him with an alertness
that seemed to bewilder him. All through
the round he was the attacker. Her de
fense was perfect.' There was, however,
one awful moment, in which Dave sought
his hip-pocket.
Dlgges put Into operation a trick hÂ« had
not exploited, either In their play or in
his oral lessons. Nor was It regarded In,
the rough rules of the camp as legitimate.
He tripped her, and as she stumbled It was
evidently the brute's intention to follow
her at the disadvantage; but she recovered
with an almost miraculous success. Had
she not done so, however, she -would have
been protected by Captain Dan, who
leaped between the assailants and called
the bout ended.

fastened It to her wrist, and was lnteÂ£
rupted twice by Dlgges showing her some
technical detail In the handling.
After a little while they began their
sham fight with knives, Zella doing all
ahe, knew, and Dlgges commending her
"When you've played yer adversary in
every way but the one you mean to hit
him In there's a move as staggers him
It's) this: A feintâ bo, to the left; a push

The sheathed blade struck Zella In the
region cf the heart.
"Yes, I see," she said, staggering, the
color leaving her face for a moment, to
come back, hot and red.
"But don't you fasten the knife to your

ZeUa picked up her jacket and took

"Now and ag*en there's a dodge and

"Not eo cleverly as you cotton to the

And then Digges and Zella turned to
again; and. Zella having permitted him
to hit her fair and square, she begged for
another lesson with the bowie.
"GucES # you knows pretty well every

The affections of Star Kye 8 yearned to
ward the former, but she felt proud to
own homage from the latterâ the young
est warrior of her tribe.
Umiwahtah possessed all of the daring
qualities lacked by his more successful
rival. The highest mountain lÂ»ut served
as a delight for him to scale, the deepest
precipice had re-tchoed with the sound of
his light footfall, and he never lost an op
portunity of dangling a fresh scalp at hla

Tall Pine was fair to look upon. The
war paid could not hide his regular fea
tures nor cloud the brightness of his eyes.
He was tall and F.tralght as an arrow,

have been the pride of Kawawa. the old
chief. But beauty of form and feature
cannot compensate a warrior for the lack
of those qualities In his son h*Â» so much

and was content but to fish and hunt.
In a tribe cf Umatilla Indians, where
the squaws were happy in being 1 but the
attendants and servitors of these beings
of the wilderness, there dwelt a youthful
maiden, born with the same surroundings
end reared with the same servile training
as that of her sisters, yet nature had des
tined her to rule, not to be ruled. At
times she serrred like a sweet wnd bird
of the forest as some plaintive melody is
puod from her lips, but again, with Indian
pccacity and cunning, she appeared lik>;
the tiger about to leap upon its unwary
victim. Her eyes, dark as right, pierced
the hearts of her sisters with dag^T
thrusts or caused them to flutter with
pleasrd expectancy by their archness. HÂ«t
hair was parted and combed low over the
smooth forehead and hung In long, glossy
braids down her back. A mantel of the
finest fkins covered her person, while
moccasins of deerskin, t-titched with
beads of the brightest hue. protected her
feet. From f-arlicst childhood she had

Indian brave would gladly have taken th.j

DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WHICH MARKED THE WRECK 'OF THE IAQUA ON DUXBURY REEF
"When day broke I stood down toward
the stranded steamer and offered to take
all hands off. Captain Bash said ten of
the men wanted to go, so I sent a boat.
We had to 'make three trips. Four men
came aboard the â¢ first , trip, four on tho

left Bollnas Steward Frank Bindslle and
his wife were takm ashore. I learned
that Mrs. Bindslle waa formerly a Miss
Floy Thomas, a Eureka girl, and has
only lately â¢ been married. She was al
most crazy when the beach was reached

startled by one long whistle and then
three short ones. Then the whistle began
to toot, toot, and I knew there waa trou

saturated with coal oil. This was set flra

We made a fire on the beach to show
them we were on the lookout. About 9
p. m. Chief Engineer Burrill and a man
named John Llder came ashore in ose of
the ship's boats. They reported 'all hands
drowned,' and said that John Dolstrom
had been with them in the boat but had
been washed out and thrown against the

the following story of the disaster to the
United . States Inspectors of Hull3 and
Boilers yesterday:
The people of Bolinas had seen the fires
from the ship and they had . set a - great
pile of brush and lumber ablaze to tell
the wrecked people that aid would-be
given as soon as possible. The boniire on
the beach attracted everybody in the
neighborhood of U>Â« town and * ranchers
Groping in the darkness, passengers and
crew began a night of terror^ Not two
miles away waa the little town of Boli
nas, but there came no sign from it that
the signals of distress had been heard or
seen. Two Bailors, John Llder and John
Dolstrom. volunteered to make the des
perate journey to the shore and seek as

In It. John Dolstrom had disappeared,
and his body probably will never be found.
For three hours his companions battled
in the sea and when they reached shore
a remarkable scene had been in progress
for more than an hour.
Despairing that their signals of distress
would be seen or heard, the passengers
and crew of the Iaqua sought everything
which would burn on the vessel. Mat
tresses, linen, sheets, clothes, were gath
ered on the decks, saturated with coal oil
and fired. The flames shot high into. the
air and the anxious, eager, fearful beings
on board waited in an agony of suspense.
Presently there came an answering blaze
from the shore, and the wrecked crew and
passengers knew that their distress signal
had been seen. But they were to pass
many hours of dread before relief came.
from shore. The strong current and the
raging southeasterly gale had ended her
last voyage. Signal rockets were fired
and siren and whistles sent out their
hoarse messages of distress, but they
could not be heard above the thunderous
sounds of the elements.

Durinsr all the blackness of the night,
from the moment the vessel struck upon
the reef until day q^wned, twenty men
and or.Â« woman battled for their lives.
Around them the wind raged In terrifying
violence, tearing away parts of the super
structure and lifting heavy bundles of
shingles csxi hurling them through the
blackness like feather*. Incessantly the
ehip ground and pounded upon the rock*
and a terror-inspiring tremor passed
through her as If the next moment she
would gt> to pieces end seed her human
freight to death.
Accompanying* the death roar of the
elements was the crash and smashing of
every portable thing upon the vessel. In
tremendous volume the waves dashed
over the deck, carrying In their resistless
sweep missiles which meant imminent
death to the drenched, terrified beings
who clutched desperately to any support
which might mean a chance against death
in Its most terrifying form.
The etorm was racing when the vessel,
only four months In commission, left this
harbor Friday afternoon for San Pedro.
The captain felt confident of himself and
his ship, however, and determined â¢ to go
to sea. Besides himself be had on board
twenty-two men and a woman, a bride
who was making her first Journey with
her husband, the steward. The northern
passage was taken and then darkness fell.

"We drifted along for I don't know how

but one of the oars went over. I picked
one up, but it was of no use, as I had to

running, and it was dark and misting. As
it swept us from the ship I saw the cap
tain send up the surf signal.

could see the lights at the masthead and
the electric lights on board. Then we
would be out of sight, as the boat dropped
into the trough. The captain had given
orders before I left to launch the life raft,
but we could not " see whether this was
done or not. It was not many minutes â
not more than twentyâ after she struck

had no facilities with which to give aid
themselves and the telephone wires were
down between Bollnas and San. Rafael.

WINNIPEG. Manitoba. Jan. 5.â High
representatives of the Anglican, Catholic
and Presbyterian churches have been con
siderlng representations that there is not
sufficient religious teaching in the . pub
lic schools. About ten years ago the pro
vincial school act was changed/making
the schools secular and allowing only cer
tain portions of the 8ciiptures to be rea3
and this at the option ef school boards
There is a growing feeling among tha
heads, of the leading churches that reli
gious exercises have been too much cur
tailed and neglected. The Catholics and
many of the Anglicans and Presbyterians
are very pronounced.
It was the Green way government which
carried through the piesent school act
while the present Promier, Mr. Roblin'
was strongly opposed to it. , Any attempt*
however, to introduce changes will meÂ»t

made a highly important statement of the

a bill agalnBt the religious orders and
also in relation to the letter from the

Archbishop Favler said: .â¢â¢â¢

me. *I love France with all my soul.' " â¢
Mons. Favier said .that the Pope
would never withdraw 'his protectorate
over the Christians in China from France,
and, that -any effort of Germany to this
end would remain fruitless.
â¢he Archbishop is'an optimist regard

a conviction that a settlement of the dif

When asked how she felt when the ship
struck Mrs. Bindslle said:
"I didn't have time to think. The shock
was so awful that 'I thought instant death

table at which we were eating was swept
of everything. Dishes rolled and fell all
about us. Everything that could be torn
loose in the cabin rolled about the floor.
"All the time the roar of the ocean and
the pcunding- of the ship upon the rocks
rang in our ears. Great waves broke over
her and swept the cargo away. When the
first boat went away and we saw it soon
turn over we thought its whole crew
was drowned. On the beach a great lire

Matsen talked about tne wreck as though
it were an every-day occurrence. Sea
man s luck is the way he puts it.
. " I . wa Â« lying in my bunk smoking," said
ne. when the first warning of the disas
ter that was to overtake us occurred. I
had Just come off watch and remarked to
the chief mate as he relieved me that I
thought we must be somewhere near Dux
buryânear enough to be careful. I hava
been up and down this coast many times
but that night was the worst I ever re
member having experienced. A heavy sea
was running and the gale and the heavy
current that seta about the reef were re
sponsible for our loss. Xo blame can at
tach to any one, in my opinion. I think
that it was beyond human power to save
the ship. Of one thing 1 am nearly cer
tain. She will leave her bones on the reef.
There Is <jnly one thing that prevented
her from going to pieces when she struck
She is a new ship. Had Bhe been an old
one I do not doubt that we should all have
been lost with her.
"My first intimation that anything out
of the way was happening came in the
form of a heavy shock. I thought It wa.5
a wave which had struck the deck ani
took no further notice of it till a sec
ond heavy blow, which seemed to wrench
every timber in the vessel, caused me
to spring to the floor of my cabin. I had
h ,}V touch Â«- d the floor when a long,
gr.ndlng shock, accompanied by a fear
ful groaning and wrenching of the shin's
beams told me better than any words
could have done what was the matter.
As I opened my cabin door and etood oa
the deck the scene was a wild one. The
night was thick as pitch and the wind
blowing great guns. Some one was pull
ing the whistle cord and the shriek of
the Kiren added to the welrdness of the
situation. Everybody was running about
wildly and shouting all kinds of order"
Captain Bash and the first mate seemed
the only ones with their wits about them
Lvery now and then a great white-headed
comber would break over the stranded
hulk and then It wes a case of clintr

"An attempt was made to launch a raft,
but it was swept away before any one
could get on it. Then the boat was

three occupants being drowned.
"All this time some of the men were
burning extemporized 'flares.' They had
taken blankets and mattresses, and hav
ing poured kerosene on them set them on
fire, the glare enveloping the ship and
our drear surroundings in a weird illumi
nation. In this way the night passed.
W hen morning came, and with it the turn
of the tide, the storm subsided, and we
put off to the Metson, which brought us
to San Francisco."
Joseph Tibbetts. one of the oilers, is the
son of Captain Tibbetts of Eureka, presi
dent of the shlnsle company that controls
the laqua.
When the Sea King left the scene about
2:S0 p. m. the Monarch was standing by
the wreck and Captain Bash. First Officer
Durbach and one seaman were still
aboard the wreck and refused to abandon
her. An hour later, however, the laqua
began to show Plgns of breaking up. and
then the trio agreed to board the Mon
arch ajid leave the steamer to her fa to
Mate Durbach was in charge of the
ship when she- went on th* reef, but Cap
tain Bash wns on deck, although not on
the bridge. Both captain and mate re
fused to make a statement any further
than to say that the force of the wind and
tide had been miscalculated and that the
inset had carried the laqua down on Dux
bury.
Captain Bash was formerly master of
the steamer North Fork, and is known
from one end of the coast to the other
as a careful and skillful navigator. Chief
Engineer Burrill was for years on the
Humboldt bar tug Ranper. and has a host
of friends In Eureka. Mate Durbach has
been for yearn on the coast, and is a care
ful man. and is at a loss to know how
the laqua came to land where she did.
Nothing but an official Investigation will
lay the blame where It belongs.
The abandoned Ianua was built for the
Humboldt Shingle Company by H. Ben
dlxsen last year, and has only been In
commission four months. She was 187 feet
long, thirty-six feet beam, fourteen feet
deep and had a capacity of 800,000 feet of
lumber. She was fitted with triple ex
pansion engines and made better' than
twelve knots on her trial. - She had Â¦ ac
commodation for fifteen cabin and eight
steerage passengers. . ,
It was the custom for the'' laqua to book
passengers at Eureka for San Francisco
She would call in here. land, her passen
gers at Powell-street wharf and then pro
ceed to San Pedro. On the -return trip
she would brinf passengers from San
Pedro to San Francisco, and on landing
them here would â¢ proceed to Eureka Xor
another load ot shingles or lumbec. ',
and it will be several days before'she can
be moved from the hotel.
"The laqua is bumpiny heavily and the
mountainous rollers are making clean
breaches over her. She has a slight list
to port, but 1 think by this time the
jagged rocks have torn the bottom out
of her."
At 3 p. m. the tug Sea King arrived
from the scÂ«ne of the wreck with the fol
io-wing members of the crew: Second
ilate Olaf Xelson, Seamen Victor Hender
son. Edward Taulson, S. Larsen and
Henry Bleuss.

NIGHT OF FEAR

PASSENGERS ADD CREW OF IAQUA
BATTLE HOURS FOR THEIR LIVES
LONDON, Jan. 5.-The Brltfsh Admi
ralty has decided to build two battleships
which are intended to be the largest in
the world. The distinction of having the
largest warships has hitherto been hold
by Italy, with the Lepanto and her sister
ship, the Italiana. Great Britain's two
projected large warships, to be respect
ively named the Queen and the Prince of
Wales, will be 2000 tons heavier than the
Italian ships -mentioned, each having the
displacement of 18,000 tons, which ia 3500
heavier than America's biggest armor
dad \ easel. These tremendous British
vessels will carry nothing larger than 12
inch guns. Their batteries v.-lll chiefly
be composed or these guns and 7.5-iuch
and c-inch guns. The determination'to
increase the bulk of the battleships waa
only ur rived at after much discussion, for
Since the days of the Koyal fcoverenjn, of
f; .. tons> tne Admiralty haa been in
clined to lavor battleships of smaller dis
placement, of which the Canopus, of
J2.SW; tons, is the best type. In the mean
while Russia, France, the United States
ana Japan have all been increasing their
displacements, until Great Britain nas ai
most been left behind. Now she steps in,
taking the lead with the Queen and the
iTince ot Wales, to say nothing of the
,London and the Formidable, both of
lo.OW tons, now nearing completion.
The Admiralty apparently nas as great
conhdence in George W. SVatson as Sir
inomas Llpton, for it has called on the
yacht designer to give advice in regard
to the new royal yacht, now better known
as the "royal naval farce."
Though the entire force of draughts
men at the the Portsmouth Dock Yard
has been persistently working in the en
deavor to patch up this unlucky boat, the
authorities have boen unable to effect
anything. It is hoped Watson will be able
to save the enormous amount of money
expended on her, though it is not thought
the Queen will ever trust herself on board
the beat.
Denny Brothers are increasing tho pre
cautions to prevent anything leaking out
regarding the construction of the Sham
rock II. rso great progress appears to
have been made so far, though a dredger
is engaged in clearing a channel outside
the yard twenty-two by six feet.
There is much Interest in yachting cir
cles over L. C. Currie's challenge for the
Seawanhaka cup. He is as determined as
Mr Thomas Llpton to leave no stone un
turned which could aid his success He
is building no less than three boatsâ one
at Harley & Mead's, Cowes, and tho oth
ers at Stevens' yard at Southampton. A
fourth boat may be built, so that by next
July Mr. Currie hopes to have the very
best talent England can produce for the
contest.
The latest grievance of English trade
against America consists in the Govern
ment purchasing nour in the United States
for South Africa, A writer in the.Morn
ing Post declares this action ia a fit sub
ject for an inquiry and that it constitutes
a most unfair handicap for English mill
ers, "while the Americans, who pay no
taxes, are able to dispose of inferior
grades." . Â¦Â¦
It appears that large quantities are be
ing purchased In America on account of
the standard brands and shipment being
better and ready at the dock. The cham
pions of the English millers maintain that
the Government is wrong in believing the
American article has these advantages
averring that the English mills are now
fitted with machinery superior to that in
uee In America, and that they are quite
able to supply the demands for South Af
rica. The protest, however, is not likely
to deter the Government from patronizing
this branch of American industry.
Another example of American aggres
sion calls for their protest. It appears
that a wealthy American is negotiating
to buy the famous Carshalton (or Case
liorton) gates, in the old Surrey village of
that name, ten miles from London. Thev

the doomsday book was compiled. They
stretch 120 feet, were designed by Leorit
and are supposed to be the finest speci
mens in the world. The ironwork is at
tached to massive stone piers surmounted
by groups of statuary. If the negotiations
are successful they will be taken to Amer
ica, though metropolitan art critics are
getting up a fund in an endeavor, by out
bidding, to retain them in England.
The report is again current that if Ladv

the Viceroy of India, fails 'to improve he

reassemble Tuesday. The Ditt's session
trill take place earlier than expected, so
Â«Â£ to allow sin ample discussion of the

Cologne Volks Zeitur^, the leading Cen
trist organ, also printed an article tills
week wjiieh attracted wide attention, ad
zSKXing that the ca:.-l bill is as hopeless
as ever. The paper In Question points out
that tie Government's policy upon the de
feat of the former canal bill undoubtedly
ruined the chances of the present meas
ure, which nobody can sa.ve. It mentions
the weak, undecided policy of the Gov
enunejit in retiring tlie officials who voted
against the bill and in promoting them
afterward to better positions. The dis
cussion of the measure will begin at an
early day.
It :e already announced that the Min

fcr Vo:i Bulow is an unwritten page
therein." i

the budpet will corne up, but it is now
generally admitted that tariff revision
will be postponed io the autumn session,

(Liberal and Free Trade) reasserts, upon
inquiries in cSlclal circles, that the Gov
ernment has already decided to raise the
grain dutie* to at least flfty marks per
ton and aiso to introduce maximum and
minimum duties on grain. It further aB
6erts that the Government is resolved to
make new commercial treaties after the
expiration of the present ones.
The trees has given much space thlÂ»
wetk to the discussion of the project to
make a separate prefecture of Berlin,
the liberal papers en the proposition
seehig therein the intention of the Gov
ercaeEt to more sharply oontrol Berlin's
local affairs. The semi-official papers, on
the ether hand, assert that the proposi
tion Is based on the Idea, of providing
better local adxulnibtration.

The United Service Magazine's article
suggesting that Great Britain exchange
the isliind cf Cyprus for German East
Africa is widely discussed this winter.
The proposition finds absolutely no sup
pert in the German press. The Cologne

Germany's possession of Cyprus would
give the lie to her protestations of hav
ing purely commercial Interests in Asia
Minor.
The Berlin papers discuss in a llvÂ«ly
manner this week methods for preventing

much attention has been given to the
American devices In this connection. The

In the states of next darker shade the

Reaper Block, Chicago, 111., writes in re-
gard to Peruna: VI was afflicted with
catarrh for seven years. I tried many
remedies without any profit. My catarrh
was located mainly In the head. I ap-
plied to several doctors but they were not
able to care me.
"I learned â¢ of the medicine. Peruna,
through a medical pamphlet.. I can
warmly praise Peruna as a certain rem-
edy. It has been three years since 1 was
cured, and I conrlder my cure lasting.
"I crave to express. : for the benefit of
the public, my experience with the re-
nowned catarrh medicine. Peruna. I
took It for seventeen weeks and am now
completely cured. It cures when all
others fall."â Simeon Armstrong.

Catarrh is a systemic disease ; of cli-
matic and nervous origin. With Peruna
the nerves become strong and the mu-
cous membranes are consequently
strengthened, thus protecting the person
from the bad effects of a changeable cli-
mate. This Is why eome people do not
have catarrh. Â¦ .

WALDERSEE, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE ALLIED FOREIGN
FORCES NOW OPERATING IN CHINA. * :
"I tell you, my brothers, that it does
not make a copper's difference whom you
put In or whom you put out. No one man
can create a force loyal to duty unless be
hind that man or that Commissioner there
1b the pressing force 1 of public opinion,
which makes him feel that his position
would be intolerable unless he did what
was right. Organization, co-ordination of
forces, these are the things that are most
needed and it is along these lines that the
victory must lie.
"The element of indifference, however,
is not the only one against which we
have to contend. There Â¦ is also that of
cupidity, that greeel and passion to get
out of every office every possible emolu
ment and a powerful organization at the
top that allows this to go on.
"I suppose that it will be no surprise to
you to learn that before the letter in re
gard to Herlihy and Cross which I wrote
was sent to the Mayor I waa approached
by a great many persons, emissaries rep
resenting all sorts Of interests, to know
what sacrifice it would be necessary for
them to make to satiate my desire for re
venge. I desire to disclaim here any feel
ing of that kind, or, in fact, any feeling
arising out of tho personal discourtesy
shown to one of my clergymen. That was
in itself a small matter. ,
"The point lay in the spectacle of a
person going to the men for protection
who were supposed to be conservers of
the laws and the peace of the community
and being deliberately insulted. It was
the spectable of the police ranging them
selves on the side of crime and degrada
tion against the, decent element of tho
community that was intolerable.
"Among those who- came to me waa a
man Â¦ who said that i he represented Mr.
Croker. He asked mÂ« If I would be satis
fied to drop the matter if Captain Herlihy
and' Inspector Cross were beheaded. I
told him that this was not a question of
men. These men did but the bidding of
those above them, and those above them
in their turn were the creatures of those
still higher.
"I told him that it was a system we
were opposing; - not a man , or men, for
he knew as well as you and I that the
policeman does not hold his place through
devotion to duty or honesty, but wholly
and solely by the favor of those above
him. who are responsible for the system.
"Some time ago I statedâ and there were
many criticisms on my statementâ that
money was the root of all I tho evil. A
condition of society where gain excuses
all doings must naturally affect the
mechanism "which runs a city such as
this. There must be some higher aim.
"There must be some loftier motives.
"We must recognize all who- are worthy
are striving for the right. The feeling
must be fostered and nurtured. There
must be personal sacrifice and vigilance,
and when you can . achieve that -there
comes the awakening of a great enthusi
asm. The rest will be an easy matter."
"It ia the duty, it seems, of every man
of the 'brass buttons' to help a 'pal.' Do
you recognize what a system like that in
volves? It means that you must bring
wrong-doing home to the culprit in such
a way that it will be impossible for this
kind of loyalty to be of avail and it is
impossible to accomplish this without per
sonal vigilance and constant watchful
ness.
"But .they are the creatures of a sys
tem," said the Bishop. "I did not come
here to cay pleasant things and the sys
tem exfs ts largely because of your indif
ference and mine. The solution of the
problem lies in Individual activity and
vigilance. I am sorry for one thing, my
friends, and that is that in spite of the
approval with which my remarks made in
St. Paul's Chapel seemed to have met
at the time, they really fell abso
lutely dead. What have any of you done
along the line \ of personal vigilance in
bprie of your evident desire to bring about
cnanged conditions? You will never get
results until you get up the proper spirit
of personal sacritice and vigilance.
"is'othing better was ever done by Mr.
Roosevelt when he was Police Commis
sioner than the nightly tours he made
through the city watching the police and
seeing that they performed their duty. It
brought the men to a sense of feeling that"
they were being watched. Every man
charged with otneial duties ought to have
the same feeling. Now I would like to
ask you men here how far any one of
you has troubled himself to observe thtÂ»
discharge of duty by the members of the
police force.
"A well-known Judge said to me several
days ago that the men of the police force
are bound together by a kind of loyalty
that makes it incumbent on each one to
see that his brother gets out of trouble,
no matter of what kind.

that the concession followed a meander

Joint Note of Powers Declared Not
Comprehensive Enough.
PEKING, Jan. 5.â A meeting of pfotes
tant missionaries was held to-day to con-
Eider the terms of the joint note of the
powers to China. Among a majority of
the missionaries the consensus of opinion
was that the note was not comprehensive
enough. Finally two representatives - of
each mission were appointed a commit
tee to formulate thf views of those who
took part in the meeting.

PROTEST OF MISSIONARIES,
Britain Expected to Take Territory if

SHANGHAI, Jan. a.â The French intend
to send a force overland from Tonkin to
Chentu should the Chinese court go there.
"It is rumored on the best authority,"
says the Chinese newspaper Chung Wei
Jeh Pao, "that a foreign power, probably
the British, will resort to force, first seiz
ing Churan, unless the persons guilty of
the massacre of Christians at Chuenow
are beheaded."
It Is considered possible that Sir Ernest
Mason-Satow, British Minister to China,
Is moving in the Chuenow affair.
Among the bank notes which the Chi
nese paid to the foreign Consuls as In
demnity for the missions destroyed^ at
Sheklung were five-pound notes that had
been raised to fifty-pound notes and ten
pound notes that had been raised to 100
pound rotes.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET.
N. W. WASHINGTON. Jan. 5.-
The Call correspondent has ob
tained copies of important decrees
Issued by the Czar of Russia,
which go to show that th.; St. Petersburg
Government contemplates no departure
from the policy of evacuating Manchuria
as soon as circumstances permit. These
decrees, which are in the form of instruc
tions to military and naval commandeis,
further show that the Czar has beea
strenuous in his orders to avoid looting or
ill-treatment of the. inhabitants of the ter
ritory occupied by his troops.
One telegram sent by the Minister of
War to General GrodcKoff, commanding
the Russian troops in Manchuria, reads:
"His Imperial Majesty orders me to
send you the following: tiia Majesty's de
sire is that not oniy there should be no
annexation of territory oi Rusdia, but, as
has been published in the oi.icial com
munication of September 1, mat our
troops should later ue recalled from Man
churia, if there be no hindrance thereto
by the Course pursued by other poweis.
In accordance with tnis imperial uccit,.oa,
you will do all that is possible to bring
ihe military operations in .Manchuria to
a s-peeuy end. At present KU*.5;a s prin
cipal Object is the construction and com
pletion ot railways we are i'U,iu..ii. , i'our
efforts must be oirected to heln this vvoriJ
and guard the wor&men. Russian admin
istration must not be introduced in the
territory occupied by our troops. You will
reassure the population, remove their
fears and brine them oack to their ordi
nary occupations in time of peace. See
that the soldiers commit no violence upon
the inhabitants after the last shot of the
battle. Life, honor, property and customs
of the natives must be sacred to the
troops."
The Czar had many weeks before wired
this order to Admiral Aliexelf :
"Strictest discipline, irreproachable in
ternal order, respect for the peaceful citi
zen, compassion for the vanquished, re
gard for their property, must be enforced
by you with an iron hand."
Tnis was followed by these orders to
both General Grouchoft and Admiral Al
iexelt, sent early in August, just after
the Russian troops had crossedinto Man
churia:
"Circumstances having obliged our
troops to crcs:= the frontier into Man
churia, we will soon have quelled the re
bellion. Order will be restored equally
soon on the Manchurian Railroad, and
work will be resumed under the protection
of our armed forces. But that is not
enough. It is absolutely necessary that
the peaceful inhabitants of Manchuria
should nd join the rebels and create the
painful necessity of making war upon the
whole Chinese nation.
"His Imperial Majesty therefore directs
me to instruct you to take stringent
measures so that war shall be conducted
with the inexorability inherent to all war
fare, only against C iilnese troops and
armed citizens; they must be defeated,
deprived of their amis and the furtillca
tions destroyed.
"But the peaceful residents, their home
steads and their property must not be
touched by our valorous soldiers or by
border Cossacks. Xo unnecessary cruel
ty or devastation should be allowed. De
struction of cities or villages and burn
ing of farms may be reported to only in
extreme oases as punishment for heavy
and bioody crimes. Such measures In
cense the population against us. Anv
kind of looting: by sojaiers or Cossacks
must be punished with the utmost sever
ity, including a court-martial of offend
ers. Any subsistence provided by the in
habitants shall be paid for in cash.
"Terrible in battle our soldiers must, in
Manchuria, as they have always been
everywhere- and at all times.- kind and
humane, not only to Â«.he peaceful citizen
but also to the conquered foe. The verv
next day after the battle you must exerr
yourselves to be on a friendly footing
with the inhabitants, feo have we always
done, with preat success, in the Caucasuj
and in Central Asia. In giving you these
instructions his Imperial Majesty is con
fident that the brave troops under your
command will not dim their glory by
any kind of cruelty to peaceful, unarmed
citizens. The Emperor expects that every
man will do his best to maintain good or
der and friendly relations."
Information received in an official quar
ter here is to the effect that the instruc
tions as given above nave been carefully
observed. Reports are current here that
because of the recent decree issued by
Russian officials in Manchuria, seeming
to imply a protectorate over that Chinese
province, the United States might have
asked from the St. Petersburg authorities
an explicit explanation of its purpose. So
far as can be ascertained officials here
have no such purpose. Other reports as
serted that this Government had sounded
or would sound Euru^an powers with
reference to Russia's conduct in Northern
China. It is stated emphatically here
that no negotiations are in progress re
specting China except those in Peking.

The surest and safest treatment for any

which acuJ specifically upon the blood ajid

the new preparation sold everywhere by
druggists as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a
medicine in pleasant tablet form. Â¦
These tablets contain in highly concen-
trated form well known germ antiseptics
like sanguinaria. guaiacol. Red Gum and
similar curative elements, and no one who
suffers from any form of catarrh and
has experienced the inefficiency and in-
convenience of powders, sprays and Inhal-

remedies after^once trying bo pleasant a
treatment as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
and one which gives so much relief in ao
short a time.
Druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh TaWÂ«tÂ«
at fifty cents for full sized package, and
their daily use will effectually cure this
troublesome 'and dangerous disease;
The danger from catarrh is that' it is a

STOCKTON, Jan. 5.â Carlo Bisagno of
thl? city celebrated the death of his rival,
CaiÂ»sar* Caroline, by rather unseemly de
portment at the funeral yesterday. He
went to the cemetery in a hark drawn by
four white horses, and when the cere
mony had reached the "ashes to ashes"
point he- threw a handful of gTavei down
on the casket.
Casollne, having become enamored of
Mrs. Bisagno some time ago. won her af
fections from her husband. Mrs. Bisagno
left her husband and took charge of Caso
llne> household. Bisagno was surprised
by the decamping of his wife to the home
of his rival, but he did not take the law
lr.to his own hands. Caroline suddenly
died, and Bisagno for a time was discon
f*>la.te. It was not the ordinary sorrow
tvhlch comes to a man who has lost a
friend, but was due to the fact that his
chance for revenge seemed rone forever.
Suddenly a happy thought came. He
Â¦would pet four white horses and have
thorn harnessed to a hack. Then he would
occupy a prominent place In the funeral
Cortege. With mingled feelings of exul
tation, hate and joy he proceeded to car
ry his plans Into execution. With white
horses there could bo no indication that
he was in mourning, and he was willing
his wife snouia supply the tears and sor
row. On the other hand, it gave him a
feeling of self-SAtlsfactlon to parade his
deliKht at the death of his enemy.
Wh^n the funeral procession wended Its
way to the last resting place of Casoline.
lilsagno was conspicuous in It "When the
*o!emn words "ashes to ashes, dust to
dust" were pronounced and the grave
digger scattered some earth over the cof

After the obsequies he held a levee with
his friends In celebration of the event

VICTORIA, Jan. 5.-While the American
transport Athenian, formerly of the Can
adian Pacific railroad service, was lying
at Taku, Mr. Davidson, her third officer,
came to his dea^h In an extraordinary
manner. He was walking up and down
the deck chewing a small Japanese tooth
pick. Something occurred to cause him to
laugh and he swallowed the toothpick.
At first the incident was deemed to be
of a more or less jocular character, and
until the victim began to show signs of
severe distress it was not treated serious
ly. The ship's doctor was then called and
he at once sent ashore for further medical
assistance. .
The toothpick passed down through the
unfortunate man's throat and Into his
stomach. Almost immediately inflamma
tion set in and despite all attention, Mr.
Davidson died from peritonitis.

SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 6.â Judge Smith. In
his decision in the case of' the people
against B. B. Parker, accused of violat
ing the liquor ordinance, to-day passed
upon a point never before raised in this
State. The defendant claimed that the
ordinance contained a proviso 'which made
it unconstitutional, Inasmuch as it con
ferred on citizens the right to revoke per
mits for a license by petition of a major
ity of voters; also that it was special
legislation, for the reason that all parts
of the county were not treated alike.
Judge Smith, In declaring the ordinance
valid and constitutional, held that under
the statutes of 1897, the Supervisors had
the right to adopt an ordinance licensing
the sale of liquor, and to provide the man
ner in which licenses should be granted or
revoked. The case will be appealed to the
Supreme Court. . , Â¦...â¢>,.

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 5.â A special to the
San Diego Union from Glamis tells of the
finding of the body of W. L. Hopkins on
the great Colorado desert. Hopkins had
been living at Mosquito Lake for about a
year developing some mining properties
which he had in that portion of the desert.
He was acquainted with" every foot of
ground about there, po those who sawhlm
start for tho desert thought nothing of the
fact and believed he knew exactly whither
he intended to go and what he intended to
do.
It was on the afternoon of the 19th of
last month that 'he left his home and went
to what is known as Red Cloud Camp for
a bucket of water. At Red Cloud House
he hune the bucket on the fence and
seemingly started for the placer diggings
about a mile and a half from the house.
He was seen going in that direction, but
little was thought of the fact until the
next day, when the water pail was still
hanging where he had placed it.
A search was instituted. The man was
tracked as far as the imprint of his heavy
shoes could be followed in the soft earth,
but where the ground was harder the trail
was lost. It is believed that he walked
farther than he Intended and when ni<ht
came on he became bewildered. Possibly
insanlty, which Is freqent -with those who
are lost on the desert, came to complete
his confusion.
The search was kept up and to-day the
body was< found miles away from where
Hopkins was last seen. The man had been
dead for many days before, he was found.
He was nearly 70 years old and came from
New York.

MINER PERISHES ON
THE COLORADO DESERT
The evidence at the Coroner's inquest
on Monday was conclusive and Cannon
was commltteed on the charge of murder
In the first degree. The preliminary trial,
which folowed on "Wednesday, wound the
coils, and Justice. Relff held Cannon with
out bail.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 5.â News comes
from Yuma of a brutal murder that oc
curred near Kinsley's lodging-house early
last Sunday morning. Thomas Cannon
was the murderer and Hugh McGuire his
victim. ',
Some time after midnight William Kel
ley and C- F. Marshall, two young men
from Los Angeles, went to the lodging
house to get a bed for the night. >V nils
waiting for the proprietor to open the
door they heard the groans of somebody
In great distress coming from the cellar
excavation Just north of the lodging
house and went to investigate. It being
quite dark, they struck a match, and its
light disclosed a big. vicious-looking man
dragging a much smaller man around by
the heels. One of the boys protested and
the fellow, who proved to be a miner
named Thomas Cannon, rushed at him
with knife, threatening to km him.
Both of the boys moved away but the
light from the match had revealed blood
on Cannon's hands and on the ground
about the place, and. realizing that some
thing ought to bo done, one of them,
who saw that Cannon was intoxicated,
a^ked him if he wouldn't like to have a
drink He replied that he would, and
Kelley told Cannon that he would go and
bring him oae.
Cannon assented and the two. boys at
once started down the street to look for
an officer. They notified some men at
the Phoenix Restaurant and in a few mo
ments a crowd was at the scene. JThey
found the man whom the boys had heard
groaning to be Hugh McGuire, a miner,
and he appeared to be suffering greatly.
A hack was procured and the Injured man
was laken to the hospital, where he died
two hours later. There were several cuts
on his body, the fatal one being a terrible
knife wound In the groin. Cannon was
not arrested until Monday, although he Is
said to have boasted In a saloon shortly
after the wounded man's removal to the
hospital, that he had "fixed McGuire."

Disaster to the Recently Constructed
Municipal Plant at Santa .
Clara,
SAXTA CLARA. Jan. 5.â The holder
and surrounding tank at the recently
completed municipal iras works lie scat
tered over an acre or more. The tank was
being tested and ' was filled to the top
with water. Its capacity is 165,000 gallon?
and that volume of water suddenly liber
ated by bursting hoops rushed in every
direction, carrying the staves with It.
O. S.'Rclph. engineer at the works, was
at the upper edge of the tank and haJ
Just turned off the water when he hearÂ»l
one of the great hoop^ &nap. He ran alonÂ£
the footway to the corner of the gas gen
erating house and leaned twenty feet to
the ground uninjured as the great wooden
tank collapsed. The steel inner tank o: %
holder was at the top of the frame and
came down with a crash on the floor of
the tank, crushing the timbers and tilt
ing to one side, battered and broken. IJ.
will cost $10,000 to repair the damage done,
as the tank will have to be entirely re
built and the steel holder must be takei
apart to permit the work to be done. !
The delay Is unfortunate, a* It was ex
pected that the works .would begin sup
plying the town with gas next week.
Contractor Lowe, who Is at I/ong Beach,
was telegraphed to immediately. He ha*
had supervision of the work or construc
tion and it was expected that the plant
would be accepted by the Board of Town
Trustees In the near future.
The oil storage tank twenty feet from
the holder is set Into the ground with
room at the sides for a coll of steam plpc-q
to keep the oil at a certain temperature.
Into this space the water from the large
tank rushed, raising the tank from its po
sition, breaking inch pipes like sticks of
macaroni and twisting the framework in
such a manner that it also will have lo
be rebuilt.

PACIFIC GROVE. Jan. 5.â This being
the last working day of the Pacific Grova
Students' Conference, which will finish
its sixth annual session in this city to
morrow, a large amount of business was
crowded Into It. The lir?t hour was devot
ed to a final conference of the presidents
and secretaries of College Young Men's
Christian Associations who are present at
this convention and after an address by
E. T. Colton, international college secre
tary of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation, the other members of the confer
ence discussed with Mr. Colton the many
problems that alway3 present themselvts
to leaders In the course of the college
year.
The day's Bible classes were conducted
as usual and at their close John R, Mott
of New York, general secretary of the
World's Student Christian Federation, ad
dressed the day's public session on "Jesus
Christ as Our Pattern." Before the
speaker began the. conference quarte*
rendered "Angels of Je&u3" in a pleasing
manner. Mr. Mott's discourse was a con
tinuation of the general theme which he
has been following during his presence at
this convention. Speaking first of Christ's
preparation for his work among men he
then passed to the methods used by the
Great Pattern in his evangelistic, life and
which are as applicable and usÂ«ful to
day, declared the speaker, as they were
1900 years ago.

LOSES HIS LIFE
IN THE BREAKERS
AT BLACK POINT
Mrs. Ruff is said to have had some
money when she married her husband.
It was her money that brought them to
this country and purchased the dairy
property. The fact that she had been
locked in her room has caused the addi
tional theory to be advanced that she
was to be mado away with. Since the
flre her husband has practically deserted
her. He has not gone to see her, nor
even Inquired after her. He had got all
of her money. Her attorneys declare
that the husband and his brothers tried
to persuade her to send to Germany for
pome money she had there. This she re
fused to do. The insurance had been
turned over to his brothers, and It Is said
Mrs. Ruff's name was forged to a- letter
relinquishing all right to it. The fact
that she stopped, the payment is believed
to have caused her arrest.
It is said the Sheriff's office Is In pos
session of evidence that shows one of tho
Ruff brothers was in the vicinity of the
house shortly before the flre started
William Valdez said to The Call cor
respondent this evening that he was-- sat
isfied: the house had been set on flre nnd'
he believed Mrs. Ruff had done It. Two
Â«lays before the flre, he said. Ruff brought
home a five-gallon can of coal oil or gaso
line. This, he believes. Mrs. Ruff used
to fire the building. The flre burned Â«<o
rapidly that it must have been fed by
oil or gasoline. He declares Mrs. Ruff
and her baby were outside when he and
the husband rushed from the barn at the
"alarm of fire, nnd that she was not
dragged through a window by. himself or
Ruff.
This statement about gasoline having
been used coincides with the storv of tho
flre told by Ruff and his wife: They de
clared a gasoline stove had exploded and
burned . the house, but an Investigation
showed there was no gasoline stove on ths
place. If Valdez can substantiate his
story it will undoubtedly connect the
husband with the starting of the flre. Ho
It was who brought the can of gasollna
to tho house, and that Ruff should buy
it when they could not use It and after
ward attribute tho flre to an explosion of
gasoline Is suspicious.. . Â¦Â¦Â¦
Carl and Jonas Ruff were released on
ball this evening.
Conrad Ruff, her husband^ yesterday de
clared to Dlstric" Attorney Campbell that
he had locked Mrs. Ruff in her room on
the morning of the flre when he went out
to milk the cows. He gave no reason for
doing so, except that she was afraid to
remain alone. In trying to account for
the conflagration he said that at 2:30
o'clock that morning he got up and re
plenished the flre in the cook stove In or
der to prepare some food for the baby.
He declares Mrs. Ruff and her baby were
outside when he reached the burning
house. This is denied by Mrs. Ruff, who
says that either her husband or the hired
man helped her through the bedroom win
dow.
The placing of the four children In a
single room for the first time and the
locking of Mrs. Ruff's door so that she
could not enter any other part of the
house point to incendiarism. It is be
lieved that the bunching of the children
together was done so they could be read
ily rescued. The tlnder-like structure of
the houee was evidently not considered
and It burned so rapidly that it was im
possible to rescue the little ones.
Mrs. Sallie Ruff, who was arrested yes
terday on complaint of Carl Huff, her
brother-in-law, who charged her with the
burning of the house and the murder of
his nephew, Carl Ruff, one of the woman's
step-cnildren, was arraigned In Justice
Rosenthal's court this morning. In her
arms she carried her four-weeks-old baby.
Many spectators had been attracted by
the case and were present. Attorney J.
B. Kerwin and Karl Klein appeareu as
counsel for Mrs. Ruff.
After advising Mrs. Ruff of her rights.
Justice Rosenthal set her examination for
January 14 at 10 a. m. The Justice said
that as the presumption of guilt of the
defendant was not very strong, and as she
had a small baby to care for, he would
release her on her own recognizance. At
torney Kerwin having pledged himself to
produce her in court when wanted.
Mrs. . Ruff, who had spent some time
in consultation with Sheriff Langford and
District Attorney Campbell, then swore
to a complaint charging her husband. Carl
Ruff, his brothers ana William Valdez
with arson. While this is the specific
charge, it is intimated that it will be fol
lowed by those of murder and conspiracy
to defraud an insurance company. Con
rad Ruff was taken into custody at the
O'Connor Sanitarium and his brothers and
Valdez were arrested at their homes,
north of San Jose. Bail was fixed in the
Bum of $5000 In each case. They were
arraigned before Justice Rosenthal this
afternoon. Attorneys Oneal and B. A.
Herrington appeared for the prisoners.
The date of their examination was not
set, but it probably will be January 14.
A theory that is advanced by some of
the officials is that the fire was the re
sult of a conspiracy to defraud the insur
ance company.. The contents of the
house had been Insured in the Girard
Company of Philadelphia for Sli'jQ. This
is believed to have been two or three
times their value. It is not believed the
death of the children was contemplated,
but rather that this was an unforeseen
calamity. The sadness of the case and
the sympathy of the community for the
Rufts caused the^lnsuranca company to
waive Its right of delay In payment. The
draft for $lu00 had been drawn and for
warded, whens Mrs Ruff had the pay
ment stopped, as her husband had trans
ferred It to his brothers. .wÂ». Â¦ -_. .. ,
While the evidence the,. officers have

fatal fire nas not been < made "public. It is

charge against her. ..:.* % .. .". :â¢ ".' "-'
SAN JOSE, Jan. 5.â SenBatlon Is follow
ing sensation In the Investigation of the
burning of Conrad Ruff's home on Decem
ber 22, when four children perished In

Carl, L>udwig and Jonas Ruff, and Wil

She was prompted in this move by Sheriff

WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â Senators Proc
tor and Burrows of the Senate Military
Committee had a. loi;Â«r conference with
Secretary Root at the War Department in
regard to the military situation in the
Philippines with special application to the
bill providing for an increase fcr the reg
ular army under consideration in the Sen
ate. Just before the conference the Sec
retary talked with a number of newspaper
men. In the course of the conversation ho
said there 'was no foundation for the
statement published in soimÂ» newspapers
that he had predicted mat the troubles
in the Philippines would end with the
re-election of President McKinley. He ex
plained that he had always avoided th^
making of prediction* in. any matter and
he certainly had never made the predic
tion In question about ihe speedy termina
tion of the Philippine troubles. The near
est he had evÂ«r come to doing so was in
his last annual report to the President,
when he summed up tne military require
ments in the Philippines as demanding
60,000 men for the .-mmediate future,
though this number nr-ght be progressive
ly decreased by the restoration of order,
the creation of a. native police and the
use of native troops in place of Ameri
cans.
We should acquire peimanently an army
of about 60,000 American troops, he said,
and during present conditions In Cuba an-1
the Philippines about the present number,
100,000 would be required. In answer to a
direct question Secretary Root said thnt
final arrangements for the return of the
volunteers from the Philippines would not
be made until Congress had indicated its
Intention with regard to their replacement
by fresh troops.
One thing settled, however, wa*.he said,
that the volunteers broueht back to the
United States would be mustered out at
points as ri par trulr places of enlistment
as possible and not at San Francisco, as
was originally intendod. In explanation
of this plan of action he said it was based
on the experience gained in the muster out
of the volunteers at the close of the Spaji
ish war, when it was found that tho vol
unteers brought home from the Philip
pines spent all their money in places of
amusement in San Francisco and were
financially unable to continue the Jour
ney to their homes. II the Secretary
stands by his announced programme it
said that it will completely upset the ten
tative arrangements already made by the
adjutant generals and the quartermas
ter's department, which contemplate the
muster out of all the volunteers at San
Francisco and their transportation to
their homes as individuals at reduced rail
road rates. The plans reached a point
where the transportation companlii
had prepared a schedule of rates between
San Francisco and all points in the United
States.

Situation.
ROOT IN FAVOR
OF LARGE ARMY
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.-Whlle the Sen
ate was in cession for more than three
hours to-day, little In the way of im
portant legislation was accomplished. The
committee amendments to the army reor
ganization bll! to which no objection had
been raised were agreed to, but none of
the contested amendments we're consid
ered. Dilatory tactics were employed by
Pettlgrew of South Dakota to prevent the
consideration of matters that would ad
vance the business of the Senate. A few
unobjected measures were taken from the
calendar and passed.
When the Senate convened the bill ex
tending the mining laws to saline lands
was passed. #
The Senate tfcen proceeded to the con
sideration of the army reorganization bill.
Proctor of Vermont, for the Military Com
mittee, offered as an amendment to sec
tion 22 thc provision Introduced by him
self yesterday concerning vacancies in the
position of chief of staff. The amendment
was adopted.
When the section of the bill was
reached providing for the appointment of
volunteer officers to be officers in the reg
ular army an extended discussion ensued.
Money declared there were many officers
in the volunteer army who were as clear
ly entitled, as gentlemen and officers, to
eommijssions in the regular army as ca
deta who, by hazing and by their testi
mony before investigating committees,
are to-day disgracing the whole country
at West Point. - ,"
The committee amendment providing
that volunteer officers might be appointed
to second lieutenancies was disagreed to,
thus restoring the House provision that
volunteer officers may be appointed to the
grade of first lieutenant.
Commenting on this part of the bill,
Daniel of Virginia declared that he wholly
disagreed with the committee which had
drawn the bill. As to the proposition for
the appointment of volunteer officers to
the regular army, Daniel said:
"It looks like a skillful piece of engi
neering by a regular army officer to keep
in the army many of the brightest and
best military spirits of the country. This
is the most prescriptive bill against the
volunteers of this country that has ever
been presented."
Daniel declared sarcastically that the
bill constituted a beautiful welcome to the
volunteers returning from the Philippines;
providing as it did that no volunteer of
flcer could look forward to any better
grade than that of the first lieutenancy
In the regular army.
Hawley offered from the Committee on
Military Affairs an amendment providing
that the President shall have the author
ity to fix the component parts of the
army ration. . It was adopted.
Spooner, at 1:45 p. m., moved that the
Senate return to unfinished business.
Allison, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, tried ; to obtain consideration
for the executive, legislative and judicial
appropriation bill, but Pettlgrew objected.
Minor Changes Are Agreed
Upon With Little
SENATE AMENDS
THE ARMY BILL
The committee probably will finish ltÂ«
work In Philadelphia Monday and will be
gin the taking of testimony of the cadets
at West Point on Tuesday. The commit
tee's examination of witnesses here and
The feuturc of the two sessions held was
the examination of Rev. Alexander Alli
son, pastor of the Bristol Presbyterian
Church, at which the Booz family wor
shiped. Dr. Allison delivered the funeral
sermon at the obsequies of Booz, In which
he made what the committee thought
were implied charges of severe hazing of
cadets at West Point. The committee had
newspaper extracts of the sermon read
to the pastor, which he pronounced as
correct. The members of the committee,
especially Brlgga of New York, tried hard
to have Dr. Allison go over the state
ments in the sermon. This, however, he
could not do, saying he based most of his
remarks on what the family had told him
and of what he knew of Oscar Booz him
self.
BRISTOL, Pa., Jan. 5.â The Congres
sional committee which Is investigating
the alleged hazing of Oscar Booz com
pleted its work hero late this evening and
wiy reconvene in Philadelphia on Mon
day morning. Most of the testimony
heard to-day related to Oscar Booz's men
tal and physical and personal character
istics. Every witness called spoke of the
high character of the young man. He
was considered in good health before he
went to West Point, and many persons
testifled as to his changed condition when
he returned from the academy. It was
also brought out that he was proficient in
his studies.

and the Congressmen Way they will also

thorough one.
Harry Lazarelle. Louis Spring: Jr. and
Albert Baker, companions of Oscar Booz,
were called In the order named. Eacli
paid a high tribute to the deceased youn*
m#n. Lazarelle said that Oscar told him
that upper class men ""had treated him
like a dog." Baker testified that he haJ
received a letter from Oscar in which hÂ«
said several of his teeth had loosened as
a result of his fijrht.
Howard Booz. Oscar's young brother,
who became ill while testifying yester
day, was recalled to-day. Howard re
lated how he went to West Point to se-y
his brother, on which occasion he waited
thirty-flve minutes- and then had to leaves
without seeing- him on account of a storm,
coming ui>. Howard said he wanted to
come to West Point after Oscar had re
turned home, but the latter said:
"You will be killed If you do."
I>rigg3 asked: "Did Oscar In hi* resig
nation give as a reason falling eyesight
instead of hazing for the purpose of
avoiding notoriety?"
â¢'I think'he d!d,"~was~the" reply. "Ha
did not want to give th* place a ba3
name."
After William H. Booz, Oscar's father,
and Miss Nellie Booz, his sister, had testi
fied to a few minor dclalls regarding Os
car's Illness and hts school duties John
K. Wildman. president of me Board of
School Directors of Bristol. al3O testified
to the good character of the young man.
The committee then adjourned to meÂ«t
in Philadelphia on Monday morning.

pretext of such fear could be destroyed
by retiring all ofScers of the Stats and

To Oare Every Form of Pile*.
Tbe only sure way to cure every form
of piles Is to use a remedy like the Pyra-
mid Pl'.e Cure, which is applied directly
to the parts affected, and its wonderful
healing effects are apparent from the firs!
application becauet its medicinal proper-
tics are rapidly absorbed right where-
needed by the delicate tissues and sensi-
tive membranes of the rectum- The cure
is natural and easy and almost before
the patient Is aware of It every trace of
piles has left him.
Tola la cne reason why the Pyramid
Pile Cur* haa been so uniformly success-
ful.
It Is In *uppository form, applied, at
night directly to the diseased parts, where
It is most needed, and not by the round-
about way of the stomach nor the harsh,
barbarous method of surgical operation.
Direct applications to the Â»eat of dis-
ease is the only common sensÂ« cure, and
this is fully accomplished by the Pyramid
Pile Cur*.
If the voluntary testimony of thousands
le worth anything, then no sufferer should
delay in giving this splendid remedy at
least a trial, as it costs but SO cents at
any flniff store, and Is guaranteed abso-
lutely eafe and free fxom opiates or co-
caine, so commonly found In so-called pile
cure*.
Nearly every drupgtst has some favor-
ite pile cure on which b* can make a
Jarrer profit than he can on the Pyramid
Â»nd oftentimes to substitute, but when it
Is remembered that the Pyramid Pile
Cure is the only remedy for pil^s that ha*
a national reputation and is sold by every
drus-pist in the United States and Can-
ada, it means something: it means that
no remedy could do this unless it pos-
6fM?sÂ«=-d positive, unmistakable merit.
The Pyramid Pile Cure has cured thou-
sands of sufferers from the different
forms of the disease, whether itching,
blÂ«*&ms cr protruding piles.

-Now that the storms have helped us to get rid of the ugly and dangerous advertising fences,

nuisances of the kind. Â¦ >
A recent student of affairs in Georgia says that wherever a cotton factory has been es
tablished in the State the Democratic majority has been reduced; and thus we see how one im
provement brings about another.
Cleveland has been telling the Democrats what they should do in the way of amending their
policy, and Harrison has been giving something of the same kind of advice to Republicans; so
it looks as if the two would, like to get back into the ring and show the boys what veterans can do.
IT IS like the opening of a new epoch for the presidency of the Southern Pacific to pass
to a stranger.
The original builders of the roads composing the system retained its management and
presidency until the last of them passed away. In that respect it differs from any other rail
road in the United States. Indeed, it seemed for years as though these forcible men Had estab
lished a business dynasty, that would long reign over the enterprise they founded.
They were identified in many ways with California, and had accumulated here the friend
ships and the enmities of long lives.
Suddenly, with the death of Mr. Huntington, all this Jong control ceased, and a new presi
dent comes to the State, a stranger, though no stranger to the railroad world.
His reception is pleasant, our people are glad to see him, and to know his ideas of the prop
erty he is to operate and of its relation to the welfare of the commonwealth.
His idea has been expressed in an interview, in which he said: "How will I run the South
ern Pacific Railroad â as a railroad or a political machine? Why, as a business proposition most
assuredly. The, road will cater to the people first; last and all the time, and no discrimination will
be shown; but I shall never forget that my first duty is to the stockholders of the railroad. A rail
road can subserve the interests of the people and at the same time be a money-making prop
osition. These two things I shall endeavor to do as long as I am president of the Southern
That is a well-balanced statement and has a rugged tone that will be appreciated.
The old days have passed away. The entry of the Santa Fe into the State has increased
railroad facilities, and the two systems have it in their power, by proper co-operation with the peo
ple and proper encouragement of production, to increase business up to their joint capacity.
President Hays will find U necessary to remove the impression which exists East that Cali
fornia transportation is a bar to the settlement and development of the State. Whether right or
wrong, that impression is widespread, and is an incubus upon our progress.
Another thing needed is a more general advertisement of California railroads in Eastern cen
ters. It is almost impossible to find, in hotels and other places where men congregate, any infor
mation about ~bur railroads. Their limited trains are supplied with literature which is seen only
by those who are going out of the- State, or by those already embarked to come into it. That use
of the economic, scenic and industrial literature of California has but little good effect. Eastern,
northern and southern railroads use hotels, reading-rooms and other places of public resort for the
dissemination of literature. .
California railroads are interested in the winter tourist travel, but information about our re
sorts is not circulated by them off their trains.
The summer and winter resorts in the Southern States from Virginia to Florida are adver
tised everywhere in the East by the southern railways and the Plant system. A tourist can find
in any hotel descriptions of every resort from the White Sulphur Springs to the St. Johns River,
with hotels and rates and the railroad fare. While President Hays is looking over his new field, in
which The Call wishes him a continuance of that remarkable success he has had heretofore, he mav
well devote some attention to this subject.
RAILROAD AND PEOPLE
NO OTHER thing is more important to the State than the education of its people. Higher
education in this country is provided, like common school training, at the public expense.
European authorities ascribe the rapid progress of the United States to the general educa
tion of our people. Trained minds in all departments of trade and industry produce better results
than untrained. The opportunity for all to be strengthened and fitted for duty being better here
than abroad, it is taken as a natural consequence that we are leading the world.
The American system of State universities is a powerful agent in this training. The States
in which they exist take a just and proper pride in their maintenance, and where they flourish there
is found, in business and the professions, a well-trained citizenship.
These considerations affect California, and should impress the Legislature. Our State Uni
versity, in its work and number of students on its rolls, has flourished exceedingly. The found
ing here of Stanford University has demonstrated that there is work enough to tax the energies
and resources of both, and that each is helped by the presence of the other.
But the resources of the State University are inadequate to the demand upon them. It has
the second largest enrollment of students iii the ynited States. Its increase of attendance in ten
years is 400 per cent, while its' increase in revenues for that period is only 70 per cent. Every year
it struggles with a deficit which has to be made good by some painful abridgment of its work,
or be carried on in a constant accumulation which will finally, like compound interest, eat up its
whole endowment. v
In this emergency the institution appeals to the people and the Legislature. It asks an in
crease of $100,000 per annum in its income. It is proposed to do this by an increase in, the State's
charge for granting articles of incorporation and by a tax to equal amount on foreign corporations
doing business in the State, and by a direct inheritance tax on real estate. In our judgment the
only objection will lie against limiting the inheritance tax to real estate. The reason given for it
is that the Federal Government levies a war tax on the inheritance of personalty, and not on real
estate, which is therefore free for the purpose proposed. The Federal war revenue law is, at its
worst, but a temporary measure, and its imposition may cease very soon. But even granting its
permanency, a small university tax on both real and personal inheritance will be felt less and will
cause less antagonism than a larger burden placed on realty alone. Besides the possible consti
tutional objection that a tax on realty alone would be discrimination against a form of property, the
owner of realty may well claim that he is being dealt with unequally and may make his objection
felt by the Legislature. Real estate cannot evade taxation. It cannot be sequestered at assess
ment time. Its locus cannot be changed. Being fixed and immovable it has to sustain its burden
of taxation. While this is true, it is notorious that personalty, being mobile, capable of sequestra
tion, nowhere is subjected to -its share of taxation. It is exposed in full only once in each gen
eration, and that is when it goes through the probate court in its transfer from the dead to the liv
ing. Then it must appear as moneys and credits, stocks and bonds, jewels and objects of art.
Caught at that point of transfer it cannot evade taxation and may properly pay for its past evasions
by yielding up a tax to support university education. An exemption of estates appraised at $10,000
or less would be proper, and so might be a graduation of the tax as the value of the estate rises.
This suggestion is made also in view of the fact that an increase of $100,000 per annum in
the university revenues will not long suffice. At the present rate of increase in the attendance
the necessary outgo of the institution will soon overtake it, and it will find itself again just where
it is now. Therefore only good will be done if the additional revenue should be found in excess of
present demands, for it could be added to the invested endowment, with the privilege of future
withdrawal as capital and use as income.
The people deal in a liberal and enlightened spirit with educational institutions, as
was proved by their decisive vote to strengthen Stanford University. They will not fail to in
dorse wise liberality toward the State University.

ALL who have read Filon's "The Eng
lish Stage" will remember that the
excellent English translation of that
excellent work was made by a Mr.
Frederick Whyte. who now appears
with a delightful book of his own entitle-J
"Actors cf the Century: A Play-'.over's
G>ar.!r.Fs From Theatrical Annals" (Bell,
London).
Tou will take notice that, unlike our
friend of last week, who discovered twen
ty-ftve "famous" actors living In th%
United States alone, Mr. Whyte ha?
chosen a most modest title for his book - ,
a title. Indeed, that implies something of !
en undervaluation of the subject matter

Of the six eras into Which, for conven

century, the first is that of the Kembles
OS00-1E14). When the cer.tury opened
Earah Kesnble (Mrs. Btfdcns) could look ]
back to nearly tv.enty years of triumph â j
a triumph won in the face of most bitter
dlscouragreraents, as wimess this char
itable notice by Horace Walpole of her
first London appearance: "She is a good i

vivid description of Kemble's actlns Is
that by Sir Walter Scott, with whom he j
had many a drinking bcut.
"He seems to me." pays Scott, "always

there Is a predominating- tinge of over

the etoiciem cf Brutus and Cato. the rapid
and hurried vehemence of Hotspur, mark
the class of characters I mean. But he
falls where a ready and r'iable yielding
to the events and passions of life makes
â¢what may be termed a more natural r>er
eorase."
The era cf Kean may be Bald to extend
from his f;rst successful London appear
ance in IS1< to h!i= fieath in 1SS3. How far
he had advanced la his profession by 1S09
we may Judge by this account of Grat
trn's, who saw him at Waterford in that
year: "After the trajredy Kean gave a
specimen of tig-ht-rojx? dancing; and an
other cf s; Hrring with a professional pu
gilist. He then played the leading part
la a musical interlude and finished with
Chiiapanzvt . ibe monkey, in the melodra
matic pantomime of "La Perouse,' and
In this character he showed agility scarce
ly Flr.ce surpassed by Mrirurice and
GauJTe, and touches of deep tragedy In
the monkey's death fcenÂ» which made the
audience shed tears." Having for twen
ty-ceven years endured the stings and
arrows of a most outrageous fortune,
Kean conquered that fortune at last by
hls magnificent performance of Shylock
at Drury Lare Theater January- 25, 1514.
Fortunately for him and for us, Hazlitt

The era of Irvingâ from 1S70 to the pres
ent day; that is merely a rough classifi
cation, as Mr. Whytfl acknowledges. Dur
ing the first half of this period Irving
undoubtedly reigned eupreme; but he had
practically nothing but the old plays to
go on. It is true he made several
courageous attempts to put Tennyson on
the stage, but taken as a Â¦whole these at
tempts were a failure. "With the new
movement represented by the plays of
Pinero, Jones and Phillips Sir Henry Irv
ing has had nothing: to do. Of many of
the actors whom these plays have made â
Mr. Hare, Forbes Robertson, George
Alexanderâ Mr. "Whyte gives interesting
accounts. And. oh. such beautiful pictures
is he has lavished upon his book! Every
body, from Mrs. SIddons to Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, is there. From such richness
it is hard to pick out the richest, but I
think my favorite is the lovely portrait of
Miss Ellen Terry as Imogen. This picture
makes you understand what Du Maurier
meant when he wrote of Trilby: "She
was about as tall as Miss Ellen Terry â
and that Is a charming height, I think."
This brings us naturally to the decade.
1S50-1S70, when Tom Robertson shone as
the leading light in the theatrical firm
ament, with the Bancrofts as his satellites.
Poor Robertson! If ever a man had
cause to cry out upon a '"monstrous, vain,
unprofitable world" it was he. After
Sardou, Sudermann and Pinero his, plays
seem to us artificial and woefully 111
cor.structed, but when they were written
they were the best things done since
Sheridan. The Btup!city and timidity of
managers made his life one long hope
deferred that makeih the heart sick;
Â¦when at last success came, thanks to the
Intelligence and courage of one woman,
Marie Wilton (now Lady Bancroft), the
sands of Robertson's life were about run
out.
There is little of Interest in the person
ality of Phelps. who kept Shakespeare
alive at Sadler's "Weils from 1S47 to 1S62.
His limitations are easily discerned when
we remember that Bottom was his best
impersonation. Yet he did a good work
in presenting a Ions series of Shakes
pearean plays in fair shape and at prices
so moderate that the poorest laborer
could afford a seat In the pit. As Pro
fessor Morley says: "It is hard to say
how much men who have had few advant
ages of education must in their minds and
characters be strengthened and refined
when they are made accustomed to this
kind of entertainment." To Phelps this
generation also is Indebted, for his com
pany furnished the prototypes for those
delightful stage personages in Mr. Pln
ero'B "Trelawny of the "Wells." Tom
Robertson was a general utility man at
Sadler's Wells and Mrs. Telfer is not un
like the Mrs. Warner who was for some
time a joint lessee with Phelps.
From Kean the theatrical scepter
passed to Macready, already well known
for his performance of Virginius in Sheri
dan Knowles" bombastic tragedy of that
name. Macready seems to have been a
better man than he was an actor, with a
literary Fen.=e rare in the actor's profes
sion. "The Lady of Lyons." "Richelieu"
end "Money" are nÂ«t great plays, but
they are not contemptible and they owe
as much to Macready as they do to Lyt
ton. He did much to elevate his profes
sion socially and he had the good sense
to retire (in lSSl) at the age of BS, when

tions from one tone and feeling to an
other. In propriety and novelty of action.
presenting a succession of striking pic
tures and giving perpetually fresh shocks
of delight and surprise, it would be diffi
cult to single out a competitor." In
"Richard III." "Othello," Iago and Sir
Giles Overreach, he proved himself
equally great; indeed, there can be little
doubt that with the possible exception of
Garrick he was the greatest actor that
has ever trodden English boards. But ho
could do nothing in comedy; he lacked
Garrick's versatility, and he lacked also
that mastery over himself and that ro
bust common sense which brought to Gar
riek wealth, friends and happiness. Poor
Kean! his first, his worst and his last
friend vas the brandy bottle.
To Indulge In the thought that so long as
irresponsible power may arbitrarily de
cide for both parties the right or wrong
cf a controversy, these conditions
will ever be remedied Is to induljre In
an iridescent dream. Many people be
lieve, and believe honestly, that wars pro
duce prosperity, â¢wealth and ultimately
benefits even to the vanquished. I re
spectfully 'dissent. The world has ad
vanced, become more civilized and wealth
has accumulated, not by wars, but in
spite of wars. "When the Prince of Peace
was born war undisturbed in fact or in
theory had held undisputed sway on
earth for more than 4000 years, but at
the moment of his birth peace prevailed,
but not the peace of contentment or jus
tice, it was the peace of Rome's arbitrary
and , undisputed sway; the peace of a
great standing army. The world peaceful

power of Rome's yet undefeated and un
decayed legions. In, those 4000 years had

lieved the world of superstition? Had" It
Civen it any real science, any real truth.
Is there in progress to-day any war, or
anything resembling war, that calls for
the admiration of this generation or the
emulation of succeeding generations?
Each and every, war In progress In the
world to-day was Inspired, instigated or
continued by commercialism, where
strength Judging of its own alleged
wrongs or rights- and Interests demands
and receives or forcibly takes Its own
measure of other peoples* goods, chattels
and possessions. The British In Africa.
The Americans in the Philippines. The
allied powers In China:, the latter having
some reason for being there, but no ex
cuso whatever for what they are doing
there. Trying to preserve the "integrity"
of China, a Lilliputian task compared with
a like effort to preserve the "integrity"
of the allied powers as they slaughter
the guilty and the innocent. Permitting
soldiers to rob homes, to reward the pros
titutes; destroying the tombs of the dead
and the arts, treasures and scientific ap
pliances of the* living. Is it admirable,
is it Christian, is It human, is it even
war? To dignify any one of the contests
going on to-day as war would be about as
preposterous as to describe a mastiff with
a mouse in its mouth as engaged In a dog
fight.
"War is, and always has been, awful be
yond description. The most terss and sat
isfactory description of it was produced
when General Sherman said "War Is
hell." But In other days and times even
war has had some attributes to relieve
it in part of its horrors and malignity.
Much inspiring bravery, ambition, love
cf home and country, and pride of an
cestry and devotion to principle. "While
war has undoubtedly done vastly more
harm than good, looked at for such char
acteristics, no doubt even war has done
much to strengthen, elevate and refine
mankind. Many a youth has been spurred
to ambition by the stories of Alexander,
Caesar and Napoleon, and inspired to far
better things by Leonldas, Horatlus, Ar
minius, Charles Martell and "Washington,
by Thermopylae, Marathon, Marston
Moor and Bunker Hill.
While there is not to-day a real war
in progress In the world, there never
was a greater absence of peace or a
greater prevalence of the horrors of war.
If this statement is correctâ and we do
not think .It will even be attempted to
be denied â there is a more immediate and
pressing demand than ever before for
some efficient ways and means to put an
end to such a useless and wholly degrad
ing condition.
People have never ceased to dream of
universal peace, and now and then a hope
ful cessation of war has appeared when
cannons ceased to roar and the sword
sought its sheath, but always to return
again with increased vigor. Kings were
formerly charged as being responsible for
most wars, but during the present genera
tion the people have more often forced
the rulers into war than they have been
led to war by rulers.
It can hardly be supposed that law en
forced against nations was never thought
to be right or necessary, but the difficulty,
at first the impossibility, of Its establish
ment and enforcement alone prevented it,
and the world by long observance became
accustomed to the absence of law between
nations. So much accustomed to it. In
fact, that we hear no end of speaking
and prating about the theory of the law.
but no Intimation about something real,
efficient and powerful for the protection
of mankind. An International congress
meets and solemnly provides for some
pretentious but wholly inefficient pro
cedure that may be respected or ignored
and the congress adjourns and the world
sets up the Joss and goes merrily on In
the old, old way. The so-called court Is
about as efficient to prevent, restaln or
punish national crimes and outrages as
the spice scented breezes of Morocco to
raze the stormproof walls of Gibraltar. It
would seem that after all the centuries
that have passed and the general dissemi
nation of learning and respect for right
and justice, and the close communication
between nations we ought soon to see the
end of all this reign of international an
archy and the establishment of law and
order among the nations as well as the
individuals of the world.
If any person should seriously assert
that the people of the world only needed
a theoretical law for their government
and control and no court was required to
Interpret and decide and enforce the law
he would at once be rated a lunatic or a
most dangerous type of anarchist.
Yet nations are only combinations of In
dividuals and crowds will do what in
dividuals will not and we have law and
enforcement of the law for the individual,
but never for the combination of indi
viduals called nations.
That international law exists only as a
matter of theory, rhetoric and declama
tion is an assertion capable of easy dem
onstration. It has been a matter solemnly
discussed and ostentatiously paraded for
thousands of years and during that tim-3
has been about as efficient a force for the
protection of the world and its Inhabitants
as the turtle created by the Egyptian
astronomers to sustain the world in it3
accustomed place. A. law that cannot be
enforced and has no power to enforce it
is more frequently resorted to as an ex
cuse or Justification than to redress a
wrong. International law was promul
gated by the powerful for the powerful,
and it has been usqd ten times as a Jus
tification for an outrage or an aggression
where it has been asserted once success
fully to repress a wrong or punish an in
ternational crime. Nothing more or less
could be expected where the only court to
hear or decide any case is the country
directly interested; sitting as its own
judge, jury and executioner. The few In
stances of agreed arbitration only prove
the rule in all other cases. Even in cases
of arbitration the nation Is only bound in
honor to comply with the award. No
power can compel an arbitration or en
force Its award unless the aggrieved na
tion Is strong enough to do so and In such
a case no arbitration Is necessary.
THE reader who peruses this article
for the purpose of being enlightened
on the intricacies and subtleties of
international law will be disap
pointed for two reasons; first, for
the reason that the writer is not suffi
ciently versed in this supposed branch of
legal learning to discourse with even ap
parent wisdom thereon, and the further
reason that there 13 really no such thing
in a legal sense. International law is only
a fine spun theory as to what the law
should be if there was such a thing as
international law and a tribunal to en
force it.
t"o accomplish this result would requlrs
between the nations, or & s-offlclent num
ber of them to enforce- the court's author

Jurisdiction, pewer and authority to
which a nation, big or little, could go with.

the meantime the court could restrain by

compel obedlenca to Its final decrees.

tice go hand in hand. The world has tried

equal number of years of controversy,
war and Injustice. The Caliph Omar at
Alexandria sent up In smoke the accumu
lated learning of centuries: the Count von

There Is. there can be. but one remedy,

The total sold production of the world
in 1900 amounted to $256,462,438, which com
pares with $313,641,534 in 1S99, the decrease
being entirely owing to the stoppage of
gold production in the Transvaal by the
war, nearly all other producing countries
showing an increase. In 1900 the. United
States took the lead among the gold pro
ducing countries, with $78,653,755; Austra
lasia ranks second, with $75,283,212. The
large production of the Klondike has put
Canada in the third place, with a total
output of $26,000,000, while- Russia was
fourth, with $23,090i862. These four coun
tries produced over 80 per cent of the gold
of the world.
The total amount of dividends paid 210
companies allied with the mineral Indus
tries of the United States In 1900 was
$130,954,000. This large disbursement places
mining among the most profitable of the
country's industries. The metal mines
paid $51,502,000, or 34.3 per cent of the to
tal, and the Industrial companies $75,
439,000, or 60.7 per cent. Among the lead-
Ing payers were the copper mines, with
$33,433,000 to their credit; the gold and eil
ver mines $13,907,000, and the petroleum
companies, with $48,816,000.
Other important products of this class
includÂ«d cement, of which 17,828,698 bar
rels were made: salt, copper sulphate,
mineral paints, phosphate rock and slate,
while the minor mineral products Included
a variety too numerous to mention.
The more Important Items of this pro
duction in metals were gold, valued at
$78,658,755; silver, valued at $o7.0S5,24S; 615,
756.S02 pounds of copper, valued at $100,154,
345; 251,781 tons of lead, valued at $22,005.
659: 122,850 tons of zinc, valued at $10,786,230
and last, but not least. 13,914,505 tons of
plgiron, valued at $238,078,737.
Of the non-metallic products by far tha
most Important was coal, of which the
United States produced no less than
274.847,779 tons; the greatest quantity ever
produced in one year by this or any other
country. In 1899 the United States was the
largest producer of coal in the world and
this pre-eminence was Increased in 1900.
NEW YORK, Jan. 5.â The Engineering
and Mining Journal to-day gives a sum
mary of the mineral and metal production
of the United States for the year 1900. This
summary has been compiled from ad
vanced figures furnished by producers and
from official sources, and gives a complete
statement of the gold production for the
year just closed. The total value of the
metal produced in the United States in
1900 was 1509,800,992. as compared with
$046,057,320 in 1S09. The value of the output
of non-metallic substances was 5755.6S0.901,
as against $645,754,305 In 1S93. The total
value for the two years, after allowing for
duplications, was respectively $1,157,162,182
and $1,049,230,594.

under the new charter had not accrued to
the city, mainly on account of the actions
of Mayor Phelan. The promises made by
the Mayor had not been, fulfilled and tax
eaters were as numerous now as under
the previous regime. The demands of the
citizens for more economical government
had been ignored by the Mayor, and the
same treatment had been accorded to re
quests for permanent and necessary im
provements. The citizens could only look
to the Legislature to redress the wrongs
now existing. The delegates adopted a
resolution in favor of the proposed 2V
cent fare for school children, and also
discussed the proposed primary law, con
demning that portion which compels a
voter to disclose his politics when casting
a vote. At the next meeting- of the feder

The Rev. Dr. S. E. "Wishard, who is su
perintendent of home missionary work in
the Presbyterian synod of Utah, lectured
to a fair sized audience, in the Academy
of Sciences last night on "The Mormon
in Politics," The lecture was confessedly
inspired by the ignominious failure of
Brigham Roberts to get a seat in Con
gress, and contained much of novelty in
its treatment oi* the well-worn subject.
Dr. "Wishard warned his audience of a
grave menace that would come up out of
Utah should the polygamous proclivities
of Joseph Smith's followers not be curbed.
In Roberts' election the lecturer found a
grim significance.. The Mormon doctrine,
he declared, is one of supremacy and the
trend of its teachings lies in this direction.
With a government within a government
Dr. Wishard found no fault, nor with the
Mormon religion as a religion. He showed |
by extracts from . their prophets' works
that in practicing polygamy they â¢ were
violating their own constitution. The
Mormons, - he said, already control the
balance of power in five, possibly six,
States. In concluding his address the lec
turer made an earnest, appeal to people of
all creeds to use their faithful endeavors
toward securing a constitutional amend
ment to suppress polygamy.
The speaker was introduced by the Rev.
William Rader of the Third Congregation
al Church, and tpoke in part as follows:
Why not a Mormon in politics? He has a right
to be in politics. He is a citizen of the United
States. Why has he- not a right to be in poli
tics? In Christian politics every Christian
should be there If he do his duty to his country
and his flag. But he has no right to bring his
denomination into politics. I am sorry to cay
that the Mormon church is a political machine.
Its history has been a political . one. The
rounder or the sect was in the race for the
Presidency of the United States.
Its political scheme is that it is to be a gov
ernment within a governmentâ a government
that shall finally domineer all governments.
Such may be Been to be a fact by reading the
works of the Latter Day prophets. They say it
is the only legal government which can exist
in any part of the earth.
In a conversation I had with Moses Thatcher
he said unless the Mormon church takes its
hand oft the State of Utah the Government
should take away Utah's Btatehood. The Mor
mon political doctrine is absolute supremacy.
There are three doctrines that keep the Mormon
church. First, the doctrine of revelations from
God. They believe the Apostles receive reve
lations from God concerning not only religion
but money matters, and so forth. Secondly, the
doctrine of the priesthood. Which is that God
has appointed certain priests who are supposed
to become a part of him. These priests, there
fore, have unlimited power and when the tithes
become low the priest has a revelation of
damnation. These are the doctrines that bind
them together and unite them for their aggres
sive work in the country. And bo they manage
to control the Mormon vote.
One morning the Mormon people woke up and
found that by the influence of the apostles
hte People's party had been abolished and that
there were only the Repubiican and Democrat
parties left, and so the political situation has
been In the hands of the prophets ever since.
The Mormon people have been led and guided
by the leaders of the church In politics as In
everything else.
They undertook to get statehood In order
that they might carry on polygamy undis
turbed. So they went to the President (Har
rison) and an amnesty v.'as cranted on the
condition that they should give up polygamy.
The condition on which they were to receive
statehood was that polygamy should be given
up in Utah forever. The Mormons called a
convention, framed a constitution. They got
statehood. And then Utah had a Mormon Gov
ernor, a Mormon Secretary of State and Mor
mon Prosecuting Attorneys, then polygamy be
came openly practiced. Then they sent Rob 1
erts to Congress. You all know the outcome;
he came out, that wa3 the outcome. Then
there was a constitutional amendment intro
duced to prohibit polygamy. Now the point
I want to make is this. That although the
atormons have pretended to go out of politics,
they are, through the medium of their church,
still active politically.
We do not want a constitutional amendment
against the Mormon church. Every man has
a right to worship in his own way, but they
murt not be allowed to violate their own con
stitution. . They hold the balance of power in
Wyoming, they control Utah, they are col
onizing New Mexico. We are faced now with
the possibility of having five and possibly six
States from which they can send a Congres*
ninn.

It's all well enough to be charitable, but
you should pay your debts first.
The head should be educated to think,
the heart to feel and the body to act.
rvery time I look at a newspaper
late.* I'm proud I'm a woman. Hardly
a day passes but the papers report
Borne great work done by a woman for
her sex, some large fortune expended
for the good of the race. Tears ago
Emma "Wlllard started woman's work
â¢when she begran her efforts toward
higher education for girls, and since
then our sex hn> never been out of the
iieJd of philanthropic work.
Think cf the schools for girls that
have been started since then, and the
great advancement made by women in
Bclcnce. Think of .the millions Mrs.
Phebe Hearst alone ha? plven to fur-
ther the work of the University of Cali-
fornia; then there are the donations of
Mrs. L-eland Stanford to the Stanford
TTniversity; the founding of the Emma
"WPJjird School for Girls by Mrs. Rus-
sell Sngf 1 . cv.ft hundreds of other gifts,
that women miÂ£-ht receive an equal
education with men.
I like to think, too, of the municipal
reforms started by womr-n. It is large-
ly due to their efforts that the streets
of our lerpe cities are clean, that ty-
phoid breeding places have been re-
moved. The uplifting of the poor,
teachirpr them to care for themselves.
seeing that they have pure mi!k; the:
founding of working girls' clubÂ«.
mothers' clubs . . . all these have
been aeeomplrrhed by v.-omen.
Then there is woman's work in war.
Men may boast about victories won.
but v.-here would the British army be j
to-day were it not for Florence Night-
ingale, or what would any of the
armies of the world be without the Red j
Cross Society, started by Clara Bar- j
ton? How many poor fellows have i
they saved from the grave and put Into
condition to again fight for their
country?
The XÂ«w Maine, the hospital ship j
fitted up by American women to send j
to South Africa, was an act to be proud j
of, and no one can forget the efforts of [
Helen Gould to save the poor "tin"
Boldiers who had enlisted to fight in
the Spanish War. but who for the j
greater part got no further than near- i
by camps where they waited, and sick-
ened, and suffered, and died. Many a
sick soldier ov.-es his recovery to thlf
kind-hearted woman; many can thank
her for dainties they needed so much,
but vrhich the camp was unable to
supply. It wasn't as If she simply gave
the money to be used as It seemed best.
No, she herself went to camp, saw each
soldier, knew his needs, and then per-
sonally saw that they were supplied.
America has cause to be proud of her.
But best of all I like to think of the
â¢work being 1 done by Mrs. Pinkham,
for this Is entirely for those of her own
sex. Think of the thousands Mrs. J
Pinkham has cured! It Isn't as though Â¦
Ehe merely saved one life In each In-
dividual case, either, for In strength-
ening women she makes them more
v.-orthy and able to become mothers of
strong, healthy children. Thus she
lays the foundation by which future
generations will become more perfect i
physically â and that surely is the I
greatest work of all. ;
The result of Mrs. Pinkham's efforts ;
reaches all. Every woman who is ill, j
whether rich or poor, whether young |
or old, may have the advice of Mrs. j
Pinkham. "without money and with- j
out price." She asks them all .to write ,
to her of their ailments, and when
they do write, she shows them how
they can be made well women, strong,
and healthy. You cannot find a single
Â¦woman who has not either been cured
herself or knows some one else who
has been cured by Mrs. Pinkhajn.
And that is why Mrs. Pinkham's
work is bo much better than any other.
Take the young girl g-oing to school.
She is getting white and thin and
round-shouldered from too much 6tudy.
Her mother writes to Mrs. Pinkham,
and before many months the young
girl Is rosy and eager to work.
A few years more and our young
girl has a position In shop or offlce, or
perhaps is filling a place In society.
Civilization to-day demands much of
the young woman, and often the place
Ehe fills In the world is entirely too
much for her strength. But to all
Mrs. Pinkham lends a helping hand.
If, when the day is done, they are too
tired to sleep, if every bone in the body
aches, if the back seems ready to
break, Mrs. Pinkham is Just the friend
they need. She will show them how to
cure all the pains, how to get so strong
that their work will never weary them.
Then comes the young married wo-
man. Before marriage, perhaps, she
has overworked, and is now too frail
to bear a child. Yet neither she nor
her husband v.'iir be happy without
one. and day by day they grow more
discontented. It is in cases like this
that Mrs. Pinkham has done her most
effective work. Hundreds of proud
mothers write letters of gratitude, en-
closing photographs of handsome chil-
dren that are the pride of their homes.
And so on through the years of a
woman's life. When trouble comes,
â¢when housework is too heavy, when
the nerves are all unstrung, -when the
change of life occurs, Mrs. Pinkham
Is ever ready to help and cure. Thou-
sands of women sing her praises every
day . . . women happy and content-
ed, who before they took Mrs. Pink-
ham's advice were slclc. and nervous,
and fretful, and utterly unable to do
their share in making home happy. I
do hope that every woman who doesn't
feel Just right, no matter what her
trouble, will write to Mrs. Pinkham at
her home in Lynn. Mass.. and learn
from her how to become well and
strong. HELEN MARVIN.

' Some ' additional - facts are supplied by
thÂ« Toronto Mall and Empire concerning
the deal In coa^ mines which Sir William
Van Home and his associates have made
in the Okanognn district, in the interior
of British Columbia. The company they
have orgnnired has been. capitalized at $4,
000,000. The ultimate proposal of the com
pany Is to control the entire coal and coke
business;, in connection with mining, in
the interior, in opposition to the hightir

Pass. The. directorate of the new com
pany is Â¦ composed of Sir W. C." Van
Home, C. R..Hosmer, R.'B. Angus. W. D,

The powers of the company are to acquire

The Director of the Mint In his prelim
inary estimate of the production of gold
and silver ln the United States for the
year 1900 affords a basis for interesting
comparisons. The aggregate of gold is es
timated to be 3,532,213 line ounces, the
value being $79,322,2S1, and the 'silver out
put is placed at G9.630.543 ounces, valued at
$36,262,431, on the basis of^the approximate
average price of 61 cents per ounce for the
year. The estimates for. California coin
cide within a few dollars with those pre
viously given out by Superintendent
Leach and Statistician Charles G. Yale of
the branch mint in this city, the figures
being: Gold. $14,377,200: silver, $556,808. ap
plying the average price of 61 cents to the
quantity reported to have been produced.
Colorado. is credited with $29,F>00,000 In gold
values for 1900, Montana $5,126,615. Nevada
$2,250,000, Ortgon $1,175,762, South Dakota
$G,617,67Q, Utah $4,237,726, Arizona $3,500,030,
Alaska $7,771,000 and Washington $826,872.
â¢The greatest silver producer is Colorado,
with Montana second, Utah third and Ari
pona fourth. Colorado's silver product
was 20,292,000 ounces, Montana's IC.750,000,
Utah's 9,500,000. .
The Pacific Coast holds its own as a
gold producer. The total for Alaska, Ari
zona, California, Oregon, Utah and Wash
ington is $31,888,561. The falling off in the
gold production of California from $15,336,
031 in 1899 to $14,337,200 in 1900 Is .attributed
to the lack of -water. . . The outlook for
water for the coming year owing to the
huge deposits of snow that has just fallen
in the mountains, Is good. The extension
of the work of the dredgers, -which are
estimated to have an output of $1,000,000
for tho year Just closed, will also help to
swing the figures back in the right direc
tion. Several new plants will also be pro
ducing the yellow metal.
This is the period when mining statistics
abound. Crippll Creek is the theme of
some of the statisticians. The Dally Min
ing Record makes the claim that the dis
trict produced '$22,569,875 last year. The
past week rounded out the tenth year of
the existence of the camp. The Mining
Record says: .
During tho decade the<-minen have produced

The Los Angeles Oil Exchange is no
more. The Los Angeles Stock Exchange
has taken 4ts place. The old organization,
under the new name will deal in the fu
ture in mining and bank stacks in addi
tion to oil stocks. This change haa been
anticipated for some time. No unlisted
stocks are to be called on the floor, al
though trading in such securities may go
on among members iri an Informal man
ner, without any record of the transac
tions being made. Only a -single member
of any firm or corporation will be permit
ted hereafter to do any trading in the
exchange at one time. Such is the gen
eral statement of the facts made by the
Los Angeles Express. It Is not long since
there were two oil exchanges in full
swing ln Los Angeles. The fact was that
tho thing was overdone. Unlisted stocks,
which were long the bone of contention,
between the two exchanges, have now
been given a back seat. There is a busi
ness moral in this that a man riding- by
in an automobile can see. On all trans
actions in the Los Angeles Stock fix
change of the value of 50 cents or over
a commission of one per cent on the value
of the transaction may be charged.
.The output of the Fullerton fields dur
ing the month of December is estimated
to have been 51,000 barrels. This district,
together with other southern districts,
sttll struggles with the price to be paid
on oil contracts. Better prices have been
offered than were expected two months
ago, but there are no large 1901 contracts
yet to placa on record.
There appears to have been a mistaken,
notion abroad that the "scrlppers" would
not be a very formidable factor in the fu
ture of the oil industry of California.
This impression seems likely to be dis
sipated soon. There Is a lively lobby at
Washington hard at work. One of their
first points of attack is the mineral lands
bill, which*has been advocated for a long
time . by the California Miners' Associa
tion. This fact binds the interests of the
mineral claimants - to oil land and the
miners for metals closer together In in
terest than before. The oil miners and
all other miners whatsoever ln the State
have an equal interest in foiling the
"scrippers." The "scrippers" believe, so
the news comes from Washington, that
If they can hold up the mineral lands bill,
which would injure their chances for tak
ing up oil lands with forest reserve scrip,
they will be able to get a new case before
the Interior Department, with a possible
prospect of having: Commissioner Her
mann's decision reversed. The Interests
at stake are too great to warrant a hope
of speedy settlement of the pending con
troversy. ' â¢
An interesting experiment has been suc
cessful in the Los Angeles field. There is
an artesian water belt In the oil field
about Western avenue and the water haa
caused no end of .trouble to the well
drillers. Water flowed a 10-inch stream
above casings that projected fifteen feet
above the surface. The Cahuenga Oil
Company solved the difficulty. Petroleum
cams up with the water, showing that the
fuel was in reach, but .the problem was
how to shut oft the water. The drillera
decided that the oil must come from a
stratum above the water and tried the ex
periment of plugging the hole at the
depth of 500 feet. Inside of half a day
after this was done the pump was bring
ing up a pure utream of crude oil, the
water having been exhausted by rapid
pumping-.. ~
The northern counties arÂ« puahins"thÂ«
work of well drilling satisfactorily and
the owners are expecting to "strike oil"
in payingr quantities. There will be same
failures, of course. Some well may open
up a district ao larsre as the Kern River
field. Every field haa had a begtonto*.

Secure Concessions Prom the North
ern Pacific-; Company.
ST. PAUL. Minn., Jan. 5.â George L.
Hampton of Tacoma. Wash., press repre
sentative of the grievance committee of
the Northern Pacific Telegraphers, who
have been negotiating with the officials of
thatconwany since December 9 last, to
night gave the Associated Press the fol
lowing statement:
Â»u" We h , ave nnis hed our negotiations with
tne railroad ofllcials and are returning
home very well satisfied with the result.
The statement that we are going awav
disgruntled and that a strike Is likely to
occur is absolutely untrue. General Man
ager Kendrick, who has conducted tho
negotiations on the uart of the company,
has been uniformly courteous* in his treat
ment of our committee, and while we
have not been able to secure- evervthinicr
we asked, concessions have been * marie
which are highly Important to us. In
the first placo the company agrees that
every operator, day and night, shall have
eight consecutive hours 'for rest. This is
of great benefit to stations where but a
single operator is employed, for under
the present system of 'calls' he is liable
to be routed out at any time and his
rest broken in upon so that he is unfit
for duty. Then we have secured a re
duction of two hours in the tima of 'split
trick' men, and the allowance of an hour
for meals in each twelve-hour trick. This
Is something that has never before been
allowed by the road. In the relay offlca
from Duluth to the coast hours have
been reduced from nine to eight and a
half.
"The company was disinclined to grant
our request for recognition of the Order
of Railway Telegraphers, but have
agreed to recognize us as a body of em
ployes. This is practically what we want
ed â It does not make material difference
whether we are recognized na a labor
organization or not so long as the com
pany is willing to treat us as a body.
The question of wages was one of mi
nor importance, and we are satisfied that
it will be properly adjusted.
"The agreement has been signed in be
half of the company by yi. C. Klmberley
and O. C. Green, and has been accepted
by the grievance committee in behalf of
the operators. The presence of Mr.
Dolphin, the president of the Order of
Railway Telegraphers, has no slgniflcanco
whatever. Mr. Dolphin is always called
in whenever a grievance committee of a
system has reached an agreement with
the company, and his position is an ad
visory one only. I will say. however, that
Mr. Dolphin is as well satisfied as we
are with the concessions we have gained.
Whatever talk there has* been of the pos
sibility of a strike has not emanated
from any member of this committee, and
our relations with the company a.:id its
officials have never been pleasanter than
at present. It is true that the company
sent some thirty or forty operators West
as a precautionary measure, but we un
derstand that they have been recalled."

"This court is of the opinion that no

above Iximbard-street wharf, where there
irai plenty of wind, but instead would
have wore ship on* shore and come head
to wind on her starboard tack and let go
her anchor where sufficient room could

he firft sighted the Iowa. The findings
are approved."

MASTER MUST
PAY THE PENALTY
THE anonymous letter sent to Cor
oner Crowe of San Mateo County
stating that the. body of an un
known mail was to be found in
the hills four miles back of Colma
was substantiated yesterday. Following
the directions given by the anonymous
writer, aided by the map drawn on the
back of the letter, a Coroner's posse
found the remains of a man about SO years
of age half hidden from view in the
bushes. The right hand grasped a cheap
revolver and a gaping wound .in the head
told the story of the strange suicide.
Last Thursday evening Coroner Crowe
received a strange missive through the
mail. The writer briefly stated that if
some one would follow the directions laid
out in a. map on the reverse side of the
letter that a body would be found. The
writing was In a man's hand and the per
son had evidently taken great pains in
the execution of the map, every detail
being correct, as was proven yesterday.
The letter was forwarded to Deputy
Coroner Cunningham at Baden and ho
was Instructed over the telephone by his
superior to make a thorough search for
the body. Cunningham scoffed at the idea
and It was not until several citizens had
insisted on some action being taken that
he decided to form a posse and with the
aid of the map make a systematic search
for the body.
Yesterday morning Cunningham and a
party of mounted men started out from
Baden. Leaving the county road near
Colma the trail was taken over the hills
to the point designated by the anonymous
writer. After riding about four miles into
the hills the body was found, lying In
the thick brush of a big gulch that runs
through the Jersey Cow Dairy ranch,
within a few feet of a Spring Valley
Water pipe. The spot selected by the
unknown suicide Is a weird place, which
was probably the reason why It was
chosen to be the scene of the passing of
a despondent and der-pairing soul.
Deceased left no clew by which he could
be identified. The body was of a man
about 30 years of age, five feet ten inches
in height, brown hair and mustache and
weighing about 160 pounds. Deceased was
dressed in a sack suit of black diagonal
cloth, negligee shirt and tan shoes. There
was no money on the body. A cheap

"The Sempprvirens Club." said Mr. Reed
in discussing the proposed measure, "be
lieves that the Big Basin of Santa Cruz
County possesses the finest specimens In
this State, and that the land is best suited
for a park for their preservation. The
Big Basin comprises 14,000 acres, sur
rounded by hills beautifully watered by
the Waddell Creek. It has been practi
cally uninjured because of the distance
from the railroad, but the outside timber
has been cut. The Big Basin itself is now
threatened, and at the present rate of de

City Kngineer Grunsky filed a volumin
ous report with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday relating. to the water supply of
this city, the supplies on hand and capac
ities of existing reservoirs and the costs,
pressures and sources of water supplied
to various cities.
â¢The aveiage'dally consumption and cost
of water works-Oi , New. Tork is 364.300,000
gallons and $110,000,000; St. Louis, 60,685,000
gallons and $17,000,000; Chicago, 321,000,000
gallons and $33,000,000; Philadelphia, 225,
000.000 gallons and $35,000,000: Baltimore,
49,910,000 gallons and $10,500,000; Milwaukee,
24,000,000 gallons and $5.000.000; 1 Boston. 80.
000.000 gallons and $28,000,000; Cincinnati,
39.S74.000 gallons and $12,000,000.
The amount of water on hand on No
vember 15 in Pilarcitos reservoir was 338,
768.000 gallons; San Andreas, 1,831,824.030
gallons; Upper Crystal Springs, 1,7.35,318,
000 gallons; Lower Crystal Springs. 4.125,
620,000 gallons. Total. 8,331.530.000 gallons.
Alameda Creek and Lake Merced can sup
ply 10,000,000 gallons per day. Bacterio
logical examinations of Spring Valley
water show very slight sediment, and a
decrease in bacteria as the^ water ap
proaches the city. The report- concludes:
"The use of lands on the banks of the
creeks and canals for sheep and cattle
pasturage at certain Seasons of the year
subiect the water there' flowing to all the
dangers of contamination resulting from
such ure of open water conduits and lands
adjacent thereto. The extent of drainage
area tributary to Alameda Creek above
the Sunol dam is so great and the uses to
which the lands can be put are so diversi-,
fled that it seems out of- the question to
expect that possibility of contamination
of the creek'8 natural flow will ever en
tirely be removed." '--

The anonymous letter informing Cor
oner Crowe of the fact that the body was
lying In the hills is supposed to have been
written by a man who Is employed by
Miller & Lux. Last Sunday he was hunt
ing in that district. He called at Me-
Mahon's saloon near Colma on that day
and stated that he had seen the body, but
added that he was a very busy man and
as he had no time to show the Coroner
where the body lay lie would inform him
by letter.
Herman Luhrsen, a lad In the employ
of Lewis, Anderson & Co., had a narrow
escape yesterday. Ho had taken a coil
of rope in a wagon to a ship at Mission
No. 2 and after delivering it was on his
way back to the store. A steamer
whistled and frightened^ the horse, which
boeran to back. In spite of Luhrsen's ef
forts the animal would not go ahead, and
when one wheel was over the stringer the
boy jumped to s^ve his life. The next
moment horse and wagon were over
board and out of Fight. Men will grapple
for the wagon and harness to-day.

clubhouse, on the bank of the. creek near
Lakeville. .The clubhouse was a frame
structure, situated some distance from the
marsh. Shortly after Dickson entered the
building and as he was 'comfortably seat

the house and hurled it down into the
marsh. The captain was thrown upon his

Governor Gage Knows ~ of Nothing
That Would Cause a
Squabble.
LOS ATCGELES, : Jan. 5.â Governor Gage
left to-night for Sacramento on the Owl
train, to be In attendance on tuo meeting
of the Legislature. Asked what he ex
pected in the way of legislation, he said:
"Whatever I have to say will be said in
my message to the Legislature. ( The pres
ent session has no Senator to elect, and
the Indications are for an uneventful ses
sion; but a Legislature Is like a Jury, and
no one can tell what may happen. There
Is nothing in sight that I can think of
now that will cause much of a squabble,
but, as I say, no one can foretell what a
Legislature is liable to do."
of that there seems to be no doubt) that
Interference should arouse the resentment
and antagonism of Â¦ members who do not
fall within hia sphere of influence."
Interior members of the Legislature
who represent Republican counties- may
recall the significant fact that the coun
try once gave M. M. Estee, Republican
nominee for Governor. 12,000 majority. . In
San Francisco Boss Kelly had the worfts,
including the ballot boxes, and when the
returns were given out as Kelly's agents
made them up Jame3 H. Budd, Democrat,
had a majority in the city a little in ex
cess of 12,000. A Democratic Governor
was inaugurated because a weak. Repub
lican Legislature, whose members feared
that Budd might win and veto their pet
measures of legislation, had not the cour
age to order a recount.
Boss Kelly is behind Pendleton in this
contest, not because Pendleton is a Re
publican, but because: he is a programme
Republican, who will make up the com
mittees to suit the boss element in politics
and thus make It easy for the bosses to
do business at the old stand.
Pendleton was in San Francisco for two
or three weeks seeking to obtain. the
caucus indorsement of the San Francisco
delegation, and he did not obtain It until
Â¦ he came to the terms prescribed by Boss
Martin. Kelly. The delegation from top
to bottom is owned and controlled by
Kelly. The boast is made by the. boss

islatureâto get the committees so consti
tuted that the honest, straightforward
members from the country cannot get
their own measures considered unless they
consent to advance the bills in which the
boss is interested. His special work now
Is to organize the Assembly, so that a
bond of sympathy will exist between him
self and the Speaker. '
Several of Pendleton's friends are afraid
that Kelly's prominence will Injure the
prospects of the Los Angeles candidate,
and they have advised that the boss
should be kept in the background. The
same advice was given- at the time the
boss took the leadership of the Republi
can Municipal Convention at B'nai B'rith
Hall. Kelly refused to take it and one of
the railroad organs read him out of the
party, but as soon as the battle for the
Speaker-ship began the organ read him in
again.
Boss Kelly is not concerning himself
about, the party. He has other business
In hand at Sacramento. When It serves
his political purposes he takes his bunch
of followersvto the Democratic party.

that, he controls all the members com
prising this Assembly delegation. He
boasts that he can handle them at Sacra
mento as readily as he controlled their
action in the caucus last Wednesday
night.
Boss Kelly was Informed from day to
day and from hour to hour regarding ne
gotiations for the caucus, but did not yive
the order for his men to go into confer
ence and indorso Pendleton until thf lat
ter accepted the terms prescribed by
Kelly.
The boss programme was handled for
Kelly by Martin Brady of the Forty-third
District. Immediately on the adjourn
ment of the caucus Brady went as
straight as he could go to Kelly, who
was waiting for news in the court of tho
Palace Hotel, and informed him that the
programme was executed. The delegation
then escorted Kelly to the bar of the
Grand Hotel. Pendleton was brought in
to hear the news, ami he gave thanks in
person to Boss Kelly for the Indorsement.
The absurd story. Is circulated that the
only interest Kelly has In the matter la
the hope of being rulected as one of the
committee to purchase a gift for the
Speaker at the end ol the session. ThÂ«

suspect that the chairmanship of the
Committee on Education will not compen

of the citizens residing- in the Thirty-ninth
Assembly District. Macbeth should go to
"Colonel" Brady for consolation. The
"colonel" knows where it can be had.
Solace for the sorely distressed and con
science-stricken members can be obtained
where "Colonel" Brady gained his mili
tary title.
Yesterday Boss Kelly declined to go Into
details regarding the particularly bright
spots in the legislative career of his can
didate for Speaker. He deemed It suf
ficient to say that he had observed Pen
dleton's career in the Assembly and stood
ready to Indorse it.
It is a well-known fact that'Boss Kelly
has business which seems to require his
presence at Sacramento throughout every
session of the Legislature. He usually
makes his daylight headquarters in 'the
lobby of the Assembly and passes the
evening hours in the sweet society of the
San Francisco delegation. It is of little
consequence to the boss whether the dele
gation is Democratic or Republican.
When the Democrats dominate the ser
vices of Sam Rainey.are frequently called

t^ ARLY yesterday morning Boss
Martin Kelly went to the Grand
Hotel saloon and assumed per-
sonai leadership of the Pendleton
forces. He was radiant and smll
1ns aa he Btood at the bar chatting with
Assemblyman Roberts of Humboldt and
telling the statesman from the redwoods
that the interests of the Republican party
of California demanded the election of
Pendleton to the Speakershlp.
The scene at the Grand early In the
afternoon reminded one of the Senatorial
contest at Sacramento two years ago,
when the push and touts shouted that
their candidate would be nominated on
the first ballot. Many of the old-time
hustlers were on the ground taking an
active part In the movement to punish
Alden Anderson for refusing: to accept
boss programme two years ago.
Boss Kelly Is keeping In condition for
active work at Sacramento. He Imbibed
nothing yesterday but Bartlett water, a
beverage which seemed to excite the spe
cial wonder of Assemblyman Roberts.
It appears that Assemblyman Macbeth
is the first member of the San Francisco
bunch ready to acknowledge that a mis
take was made when the city delegation
met in caucus and accepted Boss Kelly's
programme. Perhaps Macbeth begins to
show a disposition to frown upon Martin
Kelly's attempt to control the affairs of
the Legislature, and are not at all awed
by the imposing- front of "Kelly's nu
cleus." The personnel of the San Fran
cleco delegation, as its members have
reached Sacramento, has not lessened the
conviction of the country members that
bossism needs a rebuke.
Assemblyman W. S. Mellck of Pasa
dena, although a neighbor, politically
speaking', of Pendleton, is one of Ander-
Bon'e stanchest supporters. He does not
hesitate to condemn In strong terms the
part Kelly is playins in the contest for
the Speakershlp. He said to-night: :
"We .in Pasadena who do not know Kel
ly personally are constrained to remember
that his reputation has been judicially
determined to be worth U. In fact. In
Pasadena -his- reputation is not worth
even that, and we do not want to be In
his corral.
"The principle at stake in this contest
is contained in this proposition: Shall
independent manhood, as represented by
Alden Anderson, . or bossism, as repre
sented by Martin Kelly, triumph? I re
sent deeply the Interference of Kelly In
this question of the selection of a Speaker
by the Assemblymen."
F. E. Dunlap of Stockton Is another of
the members who would like to see the
contest one of merit alone. He said. this
evening:
"I am opposed to the Interference of, a
boss In a contest of this sort, and'par
ticularly a boss of the type to which
Kelly belongs, according to all reports. I
do not know Kelly personally, but bis In

2113 Eroadvray. Jan. 5.
The month of January will probably see
all of the tickets for the approaching Oak
land municipal election nominated and In
the field, as a result of the sudden move
of the Republican City Central Commit
teo Jn placing everything in the hands
of the committee of twenty-eight. No
sooner was this done than every other
political organization began to roll up ita
sleeves for the fray, and dates for prima
ries and conventions are being announced
in rapid succession. Up to date the com
mittee of twenty-eight is a little ahead,
fcr it has fixed Its primaries for one week
from to-day and its convention for two
weeks later.
The committee of twenty-one, represent
ing the Pardee-Dalton element of the Re
publican party, shied its castor Into thÂ»
ring almost immediately after the com
mittee of twenty-eight was organized.
This committee has organized and ap
pointed a committee of ways and means,
consisting of M. J. Keller. Dr. J. L. Mayoa
and Bartholomew^Noyes. The latter de
cided to communicate with the Municipal
League to see what could be done look
ing toward a combination with the organi
zation of the non-partisans. *
The committee of twenty-eight will hold
its last meeting before the primaries on
"Wednesday evening next. There will then
be presented the names of 203 gentlemen
who will be selected by the committee to
be voted for at the primaries next Satur
day. This will not prevent any one else
from putting up a ticket composed of an
equal number of delegates to be voted for
at this primary, but the indications axÂ»
that only the ticket nominated by the
committee will be presented.
The other parties are in much the same
position. The Municipal League will hold
primaries, but only members of the leaguo
will be permitted to vote and there will be
a suggested list of delegates who will
probably be chosen without opposition
from within the league.
The Democrats have appointed a com
mittee of three â consisting of C. H. Bros
nahan, P. E. Dalton and J. C. Bullockâ
to suggest a list of delegates to be voted
for at the Democratic primaries, and the
indications are that this list will so
through without opposition.
The conditions that surround the nomin
ations of delegates and the control of tho
formal primaries are such that there can
hardly be a contest at any primary. Each
one of the lists of delegates suggested by
the numerous committees wljl probably bÂ«
carried -without opposition and the final
flght will be between the different ele
ments and factions at the polls.
The committee of iwenty-one to-night
decided to support the Municipal Leapt!*
ticket while retaining their organization.
The meeting was a long one. Some want
ed to put up a completely Independent
ticket and others wanted to surrender to
the Municipal League completely, but
these two plans were rejected. It was de
cided to draft an address to the voters
of Oakland giving the reasons for thejr
existence, to maintain their existence aÂ»
an organization and to select a list of
delegates to a municipal convention and
submit these names to the Municipal
League with the expectation that the
Municipal League would give them rep
resentation from this list In the conven
tion of the league. The committee of
twenty-one will then support the Munici
pal League ticket.
The Democratic City Committee met to
night and set the date of their primaries
for Saturday evening next. A club roU
will be opened which Democrats must
sign to be able to vote.' There will be bat
one polling placeâ rooms 41 and 42. Biak*
& Moffltt buildlns. A list of delegates to
the municipal convention waa submitted
by the committeemen and approved,
the Leaguers.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 5.â The vanguard of the
Legislator* has arrived and to-night K
street was lined with Senators. Assem
blymea and would-be officers of both
ho-jses ard their fnencis. It was a quiet
r.'.^.t, but there was an undercurrent cf
ir.'erest that best manifested itself in the
cuestlcn heard on every side:
Â¦What Is new in the Epeakershlp fight?"
There Is nothing really new la the fight
in Sacramento. Botii sides are In the
Fame attitude they have held for a week
past â that of supreme confidenceâ and
both candidates and their friends are
working hard. Anderson Is In the Cap
ital Hotel on one side of the street and
Pendleton is In the Golden Eagle oa the
other, ard the crowd divides itself,
A!<2en Anderson arrived early In the
day. Pcr.dleton a. bttle later. On the
evening train came Jere Burke to look
after the Perfileton force* and Joe Know
land and a host cf Anderson men who
went at once to the Capital Hotel to as
t .-. Â¦-Â¦ their leader of support and assist
ance to the end, despite the riaJma of
thÂ» Pendleton workers.
The out-of-town delegation* came filled
to the brim wltxi Indignation over the
manipulations of Kelly and his lleuten
tr.ts, eo apparent in the actions of the
Fan Francisco Assemblymen. That be
ctmed the delegation every one believes,
and that in going into caucus they but
expressed his will Is the opinion of every
man of the out-of-town districts that has
expressed himself.
One of the question* first asked on the
etreets has been answered. The Governor
has promised to keep out of the Speaker
f .-. â¢; flgbt. He has assured Anderson him
self that he will remain neutral, and he
hÂ£* assured Mellck of Los Angeles that
he win tike no part In It Before allying
h'.rrtnlf with Anderson, Melick went to
*eÂ« tie Governor In Los Angeles and
asked him if he had any preference in the
Cght ever the Epeakereh'p. Gage said he
fce.S ~o-e> â that hÂ« had no Interest in the
Â£Â«-bt amd wonld remain neutral. It was a
poeltv* assurance, willingly riven, and
Uellck aayi nothing could have been
plainer or more to the point.
Before Gag* went south Anderson saw
tics e-id asked him If he would take any
lrterest In the Bpeakershlp, and he frot
the e&me assurance that wu given to
MeMck. Gsige told Anderson positively
that te would not Interfere In his fight.
These rU-ternects of the Governor are
riven out authoritatively by those who
fc^ard them, and are held to be sufficient
lE^cetJon of the attitude of the Governor.
Anderson Is as surt as ever that he has
his T.gtt won. He said this evening:
"W ben I came here to-day I found a
great rr.a.r.y of my friends waiting for
xna. I round the situation satisfactory In
every way. and as the men keep com
ing in from the outlying districts I find
renewed premises of support. In not one
case have I been disappointed, and In
more than one Instance I have found sup
port where I did not expect it. The sit
uation Is satisfactory to me. I am Just
es confident aa ever of winning."
Pendleton la ecually confident "I am
rure I shall win." he eald this evening.
**Z know my friends and I know I have
Tctes enough to elect me. I have re
ceived renewed Dromlses of support from
friends from north and south, and I think
I urn stronger now than I have eo far
been. I have friends enough to bring a
caucus, and the caucus will settle It."
There is but one other Cg-ht besides that
over the Epeekershlpâ the one over the
chief clerk of the Assembly. . So far it is
an open three-cornered fight between
Jamei 1L Oliver of Alameda, Clio Lloyd
of Easts. Barbara and Harry Wanzer of
R&nta Cruz. Judson Erurie was* men
tioned as a candidate, but It was mainly
i-s a threat to keep the subordinate flght
from mixing up with that of the Speaker
ehip. A cood. etrosgr man in the field
might upset the calculations of a good
many, for the flght Is even and the desk
bo far belongs to nobody.
In the Senate there will be no contests,
and the old officers win be the new ones.
There 1Â» not much talk of the caucus to
n!Â£ht, but what there Is Indicates that it
â¢will be held on Monday morning- before
the Legislature has been convened. Just
who will call It to order Is not discussed.
Eenator S. C. Smith of Bakersfleld has
been mentioned, but no one has been
definitely decided upon.
The Question of patrons ce is belns <Us
cuEeed by those who have declared them
selves on the Â£ peak erehip., and so have
t:ine to think of other thing's. There will
t-e more than there was last session, but
the Individual shares will be smaller.
The Legislature will be called to order
ax noon on Monday, Lieutenant Governor
Jacob H. Neff presiding In the Senate and
C W. Kyle, who was Its chief clerk last
session, in the Assembly. It la under
stood the burden of the Governor's znes
fca^e will Le economy.
The complimentary vote of the Demo
cratic minority for. Speaker will go either
to W. F. Cowen of Sonoma or Bert SchTes^
lr-ger of San Francisco.

Russia seems to hold her place as the

though there Is less and less occasion for
the rest of the world to stand in awe of
her vast population. According to the
latest census, the inhabitants of the Rus
sian empire nnmber 156,000,000. This is a
gain of SI per cent.sinco, 1860, taking into
account the people acquired by annexa
tion as well as those added' through the
excess of births over deaths. In the same
period however, tha United States- has
gained, exclusive of annexations. 140 ner
cent-the largest gain l.y far of any power
In the world.
Russia, as a formidable force among the
nations of the earth, should not, however
be reckoned with upon the basis of her
gross population, for the purely Russian

QUEER TAX SUIT.
His Success.
Won by a Man Who Soon Regretted
The income tax laws are very stringent
in the cantcn of, Zurich. This often
causes amusing complications. A short
time ago a physician, sold his practice to
another for a certain sum of money. The,
buyer sued the doctor a few months later
for exaggerating the -value of the prac
tice. In court the former practitioner
showed hiÂ« books that ho had had an
Income of $4000 a year, which was all
he had claimed. He won the suit, and
great -was his happiness.
A few day? later ho received a sum
mons to 'appear in court to answer a
charge entered against him by a tax col
lector for defrauding the Government by
giving his income as JCOO when it was
lately proved to have been 34000. He not
only was obliged to pay a larger income
tax for the future, but he also* had to
pay the difference between his stated and
Ws real income for eight years back, as
well as the fines, which are very largo
In these cases, so that altogether his bill
amounted to $5$50. which- somewhat di
minished his joy over winning the other
suit.â Zurich Correspondent In Chicago

â¢ Thomas Magee's Real Estate Circular
saj'S:
The outlook for elty rral estate In good. The
year 19C0 closes upon a FteaUy market, but one
that, seems persistently non-speculative and
tvlthout any trace of excitement. Investment
or actual use are. the.' legitimate facts actuat
ing buyrrs. On nearly every hand, when people
pjit-nk of real estate, they ask, "How about a
boom?" "When will boomlns? time begin?"
"When ere we to have a real, old-fashioned,
Jumping market?" etc, etc. In answer, we
would say that there IS no trace of excitement,
and we hope there may be none. .But the now
very rapid growth of business,- especially of
wholesale businey* and of.our manafacturlng
interests, fully Justify an Increase of prices of
all business properties, and of land in many
dwelling districts oi the city. We believe these
advances will take place, beginning with this
year, and Increasing for five or six years to
come. We hope these advances will come slow
ly and not In leaps upward, by booming and

characterize tho market this year, but we hope
not; A heavy winter's rainfall will help the
real estate market very much.

Investment properties are being eagerly
sought after, but are difficult to find In' the
wholesale business districts. The great growth
that has taken place in mercantile affairs, ie
causing a desire to spread out in order to meet
the new demands of commerce, and this In- turn

able residence properties and an increasing

Not Want a Di-
WICHITA. Kan., Jan. 5.-Mrs. Mary E.
Lease has changed her mind about suing
her husband. Charles Lease, for divorce.
The suit which was prepared two months
ago was never filed and never will be
unless the Leases quarrel again. Mis.
Lease has Instructed hur attorney to pro
ced no further with the case.
The reconciliation was brought about by
their children, all of whom are now of
age and living in New York with their
mother.
Mrs. Lease will shortly return to Wichi
ta, quit politics and settle down to domes
tic life. Her husband said to-day:
"My wife will not push the divorce case
she started. I never knew she was going
to file it until her attorney gave it to the
newspapers. She will return to Wichita
and live with me. We never did have any
quarrels, although I disagreed with her
ideas of politics and reform. She will quit
all that. Our children all have steady
employment in New York and will re
main there."

SEATTLE. Jan. 3.â The local station of
the United Statc-s Coast and Geodetic
Survey is finishing the compilation of
data obtained during the past season's
work In Bering Sea and on the Alaskan
coaFt, and the first charts from the sur
veys are expected from Washington in
the course of six weeks. Captain John
F. Pratt, in charge of the work, says that
a portion of the information will not on
account of lack of time be given out in
charts. The engraving and preparing of
maps will consume too much time for all
the charts to be back here by the opening
of spring navigation.
However, this information will be
given to the transportation companlea arrd
to masters of vessels plying between here
and the Alaskan coa^t in tho fornrof blue
prints, which are as accurate as the fully
prepared, charts and contain the same In
formation. The masters of the vessels
of the- Nome and St. Michael fleet will
have new data concerning the coast and
Bering Sea next spring.
These new charts convey a vast amount
of information which was hitherto un
known. The data obtained has added be
tween 39,000 and 40,000 square miles to the
Alaskan coast. Of this vast area 38,000
equare miles Is at the mouth . of the
Yukon. - *
The Yukon flats have, for the past threo
years been an object of much speculation
to navigators and shipowners. They ex
tend far out ot slight of land, and at low
water are In most places submerged but
a few feet. There has been but one prac-'
ticable channel, even for river steamers,
and It has been hoped that a deep water
channel would be discovered. Last sum
mer's work located the deep channel, but
as it has only nine and a half feet of
water at low tide and is very tortuous it
Is Impracticable. Furthermore, buoys are
not possible on the Yukon flats, owing to
the masses of Ice which come out In the
spring.
These would carry out to sea the buoys
or beacons. During the past three sea
sons the Pathfinder and the Gedney have
put In, under Captain Pratt's direction,
temporary buoys for the guidance Of tho
steamers.
The bays and harbor on Norton Sound
and Kotzebue Sound have been charted
and much new and valuable data given.
The work has been carried on with the ut
most difficulty during the summer. This
can be readily seen when the fact Is taken
Into consideration that the coast is one of
the worst, bo far as storms are concerned,
that Is known.
Bering Sea and Alaskan
Data Will Soon Be Ready
for Use.

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 5.â Two errors In thÂ©
seventh Inning, by which thÂ© ball was
thrown under the bleachers, first on ona
side of the diamond and then, on th*

stick. Both teams were able to hit tha
ball, but some fielder seemed certain to
be under It each time It camÂ© down. Ths
outfielders had twelve chances to pull
down long hits and they managed to find
every one of them. To-morrow the two

A Host Remarkable Remedy That
SENT FREE TO MEN!
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men,
A Free Trial Packag-e Sent by Mall
to All W.ho Write.
Free trial packages of a most remarka-
ble renifdy are being: mailed tfl all who
â¢will write the State Medical Institute
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years against the mental and
physical suffering of lost manhood that
the Institute has decided to distribute freÂ©
trial packages to all who write. It is a
home treatment, and all men who suffer
from any form of eexual weakness result-
ing from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
nnd development just where it Is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success In
all caws. A request to the State Medical
Institute. 22S Elektron building. Fort
Wayne, Jnd., etating that you desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
lulled with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
vho are unable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free sample will enable them
to see how easy it is to be cured of sex-
ual weakness when the proper remedies
are employed. The Institute makes no re-
strictions. â¢ Any man who writes will be
sent a free sample, carefully sealed in a
plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or public-
ity. Readers are requested to write with-
out delay.The Rev. Mr. Drahma spoke as follows*
It is an axiom in penology that the worsi
prisons turn out the worst prisoners and tht
best prisons the best prisoners. The ldeÂ«
then of reformation strikes one at once. Tht
history of prisons only serves to Ulustrati
"man's Inhumanity to man." The congregau
system of punishing men for their crimes li
best exemplified at the prison at Albany. Most
of the prisons of the world are congregate inÂ«
stltutlons. The solitary confinement systen
is In vogue in Philadelphia. Vnder the con
gregate system reformation of prisoners is oui
of the question. Old and young, the novltiatt
and the hardenened criminal, black and whita
mingle together. V
The young men come Into contact with thÂ«
old jail birds and the effect is to hardcl
them, too. The men live sometimes twentj
In one room and It is utterly useless to trj
to do anything for them. They ought to bÂ«
together only a reasonable time each day. Ai
night there ought to be single cells for eacÂ»
of them. Otherwise the prison is a hotbed foi
crime.
I advocate another prison in this State, n
should be built in the southern part of thÂ«
State. The saving in railroad fare for trans
portation of prisoners and officers would paj
for it. It should be composed of three sec
tionsâone for whom reform la impossible. onÂ«
for first tenners and one for young men. I)
would result in the moral and Intellectual In*
provement of prisoners and pave the way for
their reform. The present system of sentencing
prisoners is utterly wrocjr. In this State wÂ«
have the definite system. The matter of pun
ishment Is left to the discretion and capiict
of a Judge who is often times unfair and In.
consistent. We should adopt the indeterminati
system of sentencing. It is now la vogue it
nearly all the States. The prisoner, under It
is practically sent to prison for Ufe and hit
sentence Is determined just so soon aa hi
shows evidence to a body of competent met
that he has reformed.
The parole system in this State Is an np-to>
date institution. Under certain conditions
when a man has served half his term, ha li
released from prison. Ho Is taken charge oi
by friends, who have secured him employments
This ameliorates his condition greatly, as usu
ally a prisoner when he Is released, ts bank
rupt in pocket and character and reputation
The reform schools are grand institution
and I wish we had more of them. There li
only one trouble about them, however, ant
that is that they don't keep the boys lorn
enough. They are sent there for a year or tw<
and don't have a chance to learn a trade, lei
alone form their character.
Dr. Hart, Professor Smith, Craig**
Sharp and M. R. Blank of the "Whittiel
Reform School entered Into the discussion
which followed Rev. Mr. Drahms' address,
Sherman Smith, superintendent of the re.
form school at Whittler, who was to have
spoken upon prison reform, was unab'Â«
to be present on account of pressing busi
ness.

IMMIGRATION FOR THE YEAR.
A Washington dispatch to the New York
Sun says: Nearly hair a million people
from other parts of the world have come
Into the United States during the year
1900 seeking permanent homes. The de
tails of the immigration during the ten
months ending with October, gathered by
the Immigration Bureau and published by
the Bureau of Statistics, indicate that the
Immigration for the calendar year will
reach about 460.000. Of this number more
than 100,000 come from Austria-Hungary
another 100.000 from Italy and nearly an
other 100.000 from Russia, while the United
Kingdom furnishes more than 50.000. of
which number 40,000 are from Ireland. Of
the 460,000 immigrants, rally 430,000 come
from Europe, while only about 4000, or
less than 1 per cent, come from the
trcpics.
The Indisposition of man in his migra
tions to select a colder country than that
to which he has been accustomed is dis
tinctly perceptible In the history of our
immigration.

migration Into the United States and the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL bJREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â Much inter
est was displayed in diplomatic circles
here to-day in Senator Hawley's state
ment on the floor of the Senate during
the debate on the army reorganization bill
"that we are, not altogether out of sight
of some possibility, of war with some Eu
ropean power." This power Is undoubted
ly the one that Secretary ' Root referred
to in his sensational speech several
months ago In New York, and to meet
which both the army and navy are mak
ing preparations.
While there is not an official willing to
stand for the statement, it is evident that
the national . authorities are carefully
watching Germany, and it is known that
the policy of the board of which Admiral
Dewey is president has not lost sight of
the desirability of having American.men
of-war distributed in such fashion that
American interests will be adequately pro
tected In case of war.
Germany ordered four battleships last
summer to China. This was met by the
dispatch by this Government of the bat
tleship Kentucky, and by orders recently
given to the New York, making the total
effective force of this Government in
Asiatic waters, in addition to gunboats
and protected cruisers, two battleships,
the Oregon and Kentucky; two monitors,
the Monterey and the â¢ Monadnock, and
two armored cruisers, I the New Tork and
the Brooklyn. Besides these .vessels, the
United States has Its. Pacific squadron,
which would promptly reinforce the
Asiatic- command,' consisting of Â¦ the bat
tleships Iowa" and Wisconsin. The
Philippines would undoubtedly be the
battleground, as the German vessels
would have to be near. their base of sup
plies in case of war. 'Â¦ â¢-- Â¦'.Â¦'. -.Â¦â¢ Â¦
With respect to the Atlantic coast it. is
known that Germany has not -been col
lecting any supplies of coal. or munitions
of war In the .West Indies, and, so far. as
known, she ' is not . in alliance - with . any

CLOSE WATCH IS
KEPT ON GERMANY
This morning at 1:30 the fishermen at
the wharf at the end of Clay street were
alarmed by the actions of a young girl,
who was loitering on the dock. Ere they
had time to approach her and make In
quiries concerning her actions the girl
gave a cry and leaped off the 'dock into
the waters of the bay.
The fishermen quickly launched a boat
and rowed out into the darkness . of the
bay where they faintly saw the body of
the girl. As she was sinking for the sec
ond time the men took hold of her cloth-
Ing and pulled her into the boat. With
heroic eftorts they strained every nerve
to reach the dock on quick time, and fif
teen minutes after the girl had jumped
from the dock the fishermen were con
veying her unconscious form to the Har
bor Hospital. -
The doctors at the hospital had been In
formed by telephone of the attempted sui
cide, and had everything prepared to re
vive the unfortunate girl. As soon as the
limp and saturated body .was laid on the
operating table the doctors detected a
faint sign of life, and worked with heroic
vigor to revive the flickering spark. After
thirty minutes' work the doctors " an
nounced that they had every hope of sav
ing the life of the one who would have
drowned herself. Â¦
The would-be suicide is a brunette be
tween 19 and '20 years old, about five feet
three inches in height and was dressed
in a plain black dress and bodice, with
black button shoes nnd black velvet hat.
Neither gloves nor Â¦Â¦â¢ purse were , found in
her clothing; and the only article of value
was a gold ring set. with. a single opal.

President Wheeler's Report
to Legislature Is Good
BERKELEY, Jan. 5.â The biennial re
port of the president of the University of
California to the State Legislature wll
be received from the printers by to-mor
row and will be made public at once. The
report makes a phamphlet of 190 pages.
This will be President Wheelgr's first re
port to the Legislature. It is a very Im
portant document and contains many rec
ommendations and suggestions to the
State's law-making body.
In his report President Wheeler first
speaks of the university as it was when
he came to it. Its growth, its present po
sition among the universities of the world
and its future position are carefully dealt
with. Particularly is the future of the
university spoken of. At considerable
length President Wheeler gives his plans
for the coming years, offers suggestions
and recommendations and speaks of what
must be done to follow the growth of the
State institution and how that growth
may be further continued in a healthful
way.
Each department of the university Is re
viewed and criticized. President Wheeler's
ideas of what should be done for the bet
terment of these departments are given.
Some valuable statistics, showing the ex
act financial condition of the university
and comparing It with other universities,
are In the report. Ways of securing bet
ter financial support in the future are
pointed out.
The recommendations will be considered
with unusual interest on account of the
new president, the rapid growth of the
university and its bright prospects.
OAKLAND, Jan. 5. â Kindergartens
and compulsory education, two
subjects that are dear to the
heart of the California educators,
were under discussion at the ses
sions to-day of the State Conference of
Charities at the First Congregational
Church. They were exhaustively discussed
by the various Interested persons piesent.
For the system of kinciergartcning now in
vogue there was some severe criticism,
and the bill prepared by the educational
commission, proposing compulsory educa
tion and parental schools, received its
share of attack. " There was a large at
tendance at each of the three sessions.
School Superintendent J. W. McCly
monds of Oakland presided during the
morning session, when the relations of
kindergartens to the public schools was
the topic for discussion. He delivered a
short address in introducing the discus
sion, making the declaration that if the
preliminary instruction of children was
well done there would be no need for re
form schoolF. Love, not the amount of
knowledge put into the infant's head, was
the way to win it to future usefulness.
The kindergarten 1 !* office should Le to sup
ply the absence of the mother. The love
of a good mother is th^ greatest charac
ter-making influence in the world, and its
place should be filled, when there is a.
lack of it, by the kindergarten. â¢Â¦â¢ââ¢- 5
Something of a sensation was sprung on
the session when a paper written by Mrs.
Lucy A. Walker, a teacher in the primary
school department of Oakland, was read.
Mrs. Walker was unsparing In her criti
cism of present methods of conducting
kindergartens. She combated the idea
that the kindergarten child is taught to
think. It was her experience' that such
children are too dependentâ that Instead
of being taught to rely upon themselves
they sought assistance from companions
or their teachers.
"Children with kindergarten advan
tages ought to be found superior
in all ways to those who are
deprived of them," read Vrs. Walker's
paper. "But there is general com
plaint from primary school teachers
that kindergarten pupils give more trou
ble â that is, they have less respect for
authority â than any others; that- they are
less teachable; that they show less con
trol of attention and are less willing to
work, and that they have little sense of
personal responsibility.
"The trouble is that the underlying
principles governing the practice in these
TELLS OF NEEDS
OF UNIVERSITY
privilege would be abused, of course, but
that anything more rigid than the pro
posed law would not pass the Legislature.
"Distruct Nursing" was the subject ol
a paper read by Miss Octavlne Briggs of
San Francisco. Miss Briggs told about
the little home she lives in in Tehama
street, where the sick and needy send for
things to eat and medicine and to borrow
money. She is able to carry on her work
through voluntary subscriptions from
friends of the cause and the small sums
from her charges. She pleaded that the
usefulness of nurses would be doubled If
they went to live among those whom they
help.
The proposed act creating a State Board
of Charitits and Corrections provides that
such board shall consist of six commis
sioners, who shall hold office for six years
each, the members of the first board,
however, to classify themselves by lot so
that two shall go out of office every two
years for six years; that the Governor
shall be a member ex-offlcio; that women
may be appointed members; that no of
ficial or director of an Institution subject
to the terms of the act shall have a place
on the board; that the Commissioners
shall act without pay, but shall receive
their traveling expenses; that the ex
penses of the board In any one year, in
cluding the secretary's salary of $1800.
shall not exceed $4000; that the board
shall provide itself with offices in the city
of San Francisco; that the failure of any
Commissioner to attend three consecutive
meetings, unless excused by a vote of the
board, shall be construed as a resigna
tion;-that the board shall investigate and
make reports upon the public charitable
and correctional institutions of the State
and cities and counties of the State, and
such private institutions as receive pub
lic funds other than State hospitals; that
all plans for new jails, workhouses, aJms
houaes, children's homes, orphan asylums
and public hospitals, and for Important
alterations to suich like institutions as are
in existence, shall before adoption be sub
mitted to the board for suggestions and
criticism.
Prison Director R. M. Fitzgerald was
in charge of the programme at this even
ing's session. Prison reform was the sub
ject under discussion. Before introducing
Rev. E. Drahms, chaplain of San Quentln
Prison, Mr. Fitzgerald gave a brief history
of the prisons in this State. The first
were located In ships' hulks. San Quen
tin was located in 1851. Prisoners were
loaned to contractors for terms of years,
which proved a pernicious practice. Prison
directors, when they got into office, used
the place to pay their political debts.
There was an utter lack of discipline, and
escapes "were frequent.
two branches of education are antago
nistic; so much so that the one cannot
possibly serve as a preparation for the
other. If asked to specify some point
wherein this antagonism is most evident
I should say it is in the ideas of what
constitutes the greatest good for the child.
The kindergarten s>ays if only the child
is kept happy all other goods will be
added unto him without effort on his
part. 'The school eays the child must en
dure a season of Jiscipllne to secure his
ultimate happiness, which Is held to- be
the same in both cases, viz.: The highest
mental and moral attainment. Here we
are precipitated Into the old world dis
pute as to what constitutes happiness â
immediate pleasure or future reward.
Kindergarten practice emphasizes the
former Idea, school emphasizes the lat
ter."
Superintendent McClymonds. replying to
Mrs. Walker's views, said that all she
advocated would come in time. Just now
efforts wore being' directed toward har
monizing the work of the kindergarten
and the primary school. This had been
accomplished in the one public kinder
garten of this city, Mr. McClymonds said,
and teachers were glad to have pupils
come from it.
Addresses upon kindergarten work were
made by Miss Anona M. Stovall of the
Golden Gate Kindergarten of San Fran
cisco, Miss Grace Bernard of Oakland
and R. M. Fitzgerald, president of the
State Board of Prison Commissioners. .
The work of the Young Men's Christian
Association was' discussed Just prior to
the talk and papers on the kindergarten
work. The speakers were D. Edward Col
lins, president of the local association;
Henry J. McCoy, secretary of the San
Francisco Association, and W. M. Par
sons, State secretary of the association.
The interesting statement was made by
Mr. McCoy that in the night schools con
ducted by the association In the United
States 26.000 boys were enrolled andover
four hundred associations were formed in
colleges, with a total membership of
38,000.
With Professor Mary Roberts Smith
presiding the afternoon session com
menced with a discussion of the com
pulsory school law which is to be pre
sented for passage at the next Legisla
ture. Miss Jessie Watson, representing
the Association of College Alumnae, read
the bill and commented upon Its features.
It proposes to authorize the boards of
education of the State to compel children
under fourteen years of age to attend
school and to maintain parental schools,
where a truant officer provided for will
detain incorrigible children. The bill pro

The sons of Buencamino, referred to in
the dispatch, are attending: a. private

have received no word concerning Agui

was being closely pursued by the Ameri

ihtir former leader. Although deserting
Apuinaldo, his countrymen still consider
him h. great patriot and will not betray
him. The senior Buencamino does not
state what he considers will eventually
happen to the Filipino general.
"If Apruinaldo is dead." said Phillip

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. Jan. 5.
The city of Oakland did not give its
consent to the retention of commissions
by R. W. Snow when City Assessor, by
the fact that the accounts of the Asses
sor were approved by city experts. Judge
Hall so ruled to-day in the suit brought
by the city against the Mayor to recover
these fees. All evidence upon this point
was ruled out and the trial went on upon
the legal right of the Assessor to with
hold those commissions.
At the resumption of the trial this
morning City Clerk Tompkins, to await
whose return from his vacation the court
adjourned before the holidays, waa called
to tell what he knew about the missing
JIO.000 bond filed in 1S37 by Mr. Snow upon
taking office. The loss of this paper made
It impossible to proceed with the trial at
that time.
Tompkins said that he had made a
thorough search of his office for the bond,
but had been unable to ilnd it. In an
swer to further questions, he testified
that he had no recollection of receiving
the paper from ex-Mayor Thomas. The
latter had given him a number of such
documents, but he had given them back,
as he did not consider It within his prov
ince to be responsible for them.
City Attorney Dow then proposed to in
troduce a certified copy of the bond.
Attorney Charles H. Wilson for the
bondsmen objected to the admission of
the copy. The court, however, allowed it
to go In.
Attorney Coogan, for Mayor Snow, then
began offering the evidence to show the
city's consent to the retention of the fees
to lay a foundation for a motion for a
nonsuit.
E. H. Morgan, who served as city ex
pert under ex-Mayor Thomas, was called
to testify to having examined and ap
proved Snow's accounts as City Auditor
and Assessor. City Attorney Dow ob
jected to the question.
"I can't see that the witness' testimony
on that point could show that the city
consented to the retention of the money/'
said Judge Hall.
"It would tend to show It," said Coogan.
"I think not." said the court; "the ob
jection Is sustained."
The testimony of the expert that he
knew that the fees were being held out
was also rejected and the motion for a
nonsuit was denied. Both sides then
rested and the court set next Tuesday as
the date for hearing the arguments.
Judge Hall Denies a Non
suit Asked by Snow's
Bondsmen.

by the Supreme Court.
The specific offense lor which Arlington
was prosecute*! was the theft of $214 S5
from Mrs. Minnie Smith. According to
his usual method of operation Arlington
had obtained control cf his victim
by an offer of marriage. On the
pretense of rhowing her the loca

her to a lonely spot '. and Â¦ then
robbed her of her satchel containing the.
money. Many other Instances, of the
swindling schemes worked by Arlington
have come to light since he was sent tv>

money, have come to him at the County
jail from female dupos In various parts
of the country. About a. month ago a
woman from Oregon arrived In town ex
pecting him to meet her â¢ and become

DAYTIME SESSIONS OF THE STATE CONFERENCE
OF CHARITIES ARE TAKEN UP IN DISCUSSING
KINDERGARTENS AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION
that they are poor nnd dependent upon
their children the Board of Education can
excuse them from attendance.
"There is no doubt that the lack of
a compulsory education law In this State
has caused many mental and physical
wrecks," said Superintendent McCly
monds. "The schools have not been es
tablished for the simple purpose of giving
citizens an opportunity to send their chil
dren to them. If the State gives us
schools it has a right to expect the chil
dren for whom they are supported to go
to them. It ought surely to have the
right .to compel them to go If necessary.
"There is a law on the statute books
now compelling parents to send their chil
dren to school. It was passed in 1SS4.
But It Is inoperative because It makes no
provision for truancy. The whole force
of the statute lies in ~the fact that a tru
ant officer is provided. If there Is no Buch
provision nothing can be accomplished.
"Children intrusted to our care ought
to have the best possible education under
the best possible conditions. We spend
lots of money on schools, but ought to
spend more. We would then have to
spend less on penitentiaries. I'm a firm
believer in the doctrine that the child
should not be sent to school if Its parents
are to be pauperized in so doing, and I'm
a believer In- the doctrine that the child
should not be pauperized In mind and
body for the sake of its greedy parents.
This proposed law contains a provision
that Boards of Education shall decide
whether parents are able to support their
children. I think that Is the safest way
to submit it to the Legislature, as it will
be sure to meet with opposition unless it
contains some such relief measure for
people who are really dependent.
"The parental school is a necessity.
Without it a compulsory education law
amounts to nothing:. In my capacity as
School Superintendent many parents come
to me for advice. I can't do anything but
tell them to send their children to the
reform school if they are particularly bad.
A reform school Is the only place In the
State where we can send such boys."
During the general discussion which fol
lowed Mr. McClymonds' remarks, L. P.
Fisher, principal of the Central High
School, Dr. H. H. Hart, Mrs. Watson,
Professor Smith and Miss Katherine Fel
ton spoke . Mr. Fisher said the disposition
was to interfere as little as possible with
the rights of parents. Dr. Hart thought
the . provision giving educational boards
the right to excuse the children of poor
parents would have the effect of render
ins the law ineffective. Parents â¢ would
be apt to pauperize themselves, he con
tended, and appeal to the sympathies of
the board. Mr. McClymonds thought the

. The Rev. Milton D.; Buck will preach at
cumstance of a Shooting Affair.
"Speaking of pistols," said a New Or
leans lawyer, "I am reminded of a re
markable case in which I was interested
soon after the war, when I was practicing
over in' Alabama. A general shooting, af
fray, growing out of a family feud, had
taken place at a crossroads store, and an
influential planter named McDermott was
killed. He was standing behind a little
shed a considerable distance away at the
time, and a young man named Lee Allen
was firing out of. the store window at an
other of the crowd. McDermott was hit
in the head and the bullet was identified
as coming from Allen's pistol, which was
an English weapon of a very unusual size
âcaliber 47. But the singular part of the
affairwas that the place where the plant
er stood was out of range of the window.
The corner of the shed interposed, and it
was simply impossible to understand how
the missile reached its mark. * I was en
gaged tor the defense, and after carefully
measuring the ground and firing several
test shots I became convinced that my
client was innocent and that there had
been another 47-caliber pistol in the fight.
The circumstantial evidence seemed to
bear out my theory indisputably, and I
felt, confident of an acquittal, when, at
the eleventh hour. â¢ the unexpected hap
pened and knocked out my props. It oc
curred to the prosecuting attorney to test
Allen's weapon and find out exactly how
it carried. Accordingly, he screwed it In
a vise and blazed away a few times at a
target at different distances. The result
was astounding. Up to about fifty feet
it shot all right, but at that point the bul
let suddenly, veered off at all sorts of ex
traordinary tangents. Sometimes it sailed
up into the air. sometimes it plunged
downward and sometimes it swooped off
to one slÂ«e. The explanation, however,
was simple. It seemed that Allen had
found the barrel too long, and a week or
so before the fight had filed off several
inches. That operation completely de
stroyed the effect of the rifling, and in
stead of imparting a true circular twist
to the bullet It gave it a peculiar 'Eng
lish,' as billiard players would say. which
was as liable to send it In one direction
as another. That experiment fully ex
plained the mystery of McDermott's tak
ing off. My client was convicted of man
slaughter and afterward pardoned. I
don't know what became of the pistol. It
should have been preserved as the only
gun on earth ihat pitched curved balls.â

PISTOL FIRES CURVED BALLS.
Lawyer Relates a Remarkable Cir-
in cases in which soldiers suffer from
sleeplessness, while he adds that, as an
aid to the digestion of often fairly indi
gestible food the pipe is invaluable. Again.
It is stated that, so far from drying tho
mouth, the fumes of tobacco are recop
nized by soldiers as assisting to quench
the sense of thirst. I suppose it will al
ways be so in this matter of tobacco
smoking and its pros and cons. To my
mind, it is a relative question at best.
The "one man's meat another man's poi
son" idea contains a grave physiological
truth. To the majority of modern:*

Incandescent Ught Not Harmful.
Consul Hughes of Cobnrg informs the
State Department that the medical facul
ty of the University of Heidelberg has
made a very interesting report on the ef
fect of incandescent light (gas or electri
cal) on the eyes. After having carefully
weighed all the pro3 and cons on the ques
tion, the verdict is that the incandescent
light is not harmful. For lighting large
halls or places of entertainment, elec

Tobacco and the Soldier.
A discussion has been taking place on
the use of tobacco by the soldier in the
field. One side of the argument holds that
tobacco 'smoking is detrimental to good
shooting, and it is added that at Bisley
the best shots are "almost invariably non
smokers." This latter allegation is stren
uously denied by the opposing camp, and
it would be interesting to obtain reliable
evidence on this point, apart from mere
assertion. The 1 old argument is also re
vived that smoking, by drying the throat,
encourages drinking. To this conclusion
Is opposed the pregnant fact that a very
larye proportion of total abstainers enjoy
their pipe. A writer who has been
through many campaigns, and whose ex
perience is. therefore, worth recording,
speaks warmly of the value of tobacco
our loss of place by the reflection the Enp
llsh ascents were most numerous in the
days when Mont Blanc was more difficult
than it is now. The pioneers, in 17S6. were
Savoyards. The first Swiss and the first
English ascents followed in 1787. Then
came the first German ascent In 1802. the
first Polish ascent In 181$, the first Ameri
can ascent in 1819, the first French ascent
in 1S34, and the first Italian ascent In Is JO.

LIKE BAISING THE DEAD.
An Account of a Gruesome Experi-
merit In a Hospital In Denmark.
Dr. Soren Christiansen of Missoula,
Mont., was in -Missoula yesterday on hla
way home after a two months' visit in
Denmark. Dr. Christiansen was present
at a remarkable attempt to bring back to
life a man who had died in a hospital at
Xaestved, Denmark, two weeks ago. The
experiment was measurably successful, as
resuscitation was effected several hours
after the man was pronounced dead. Dr.
Maag, who was in charge, was unable to
maintain life, however.
The patient had died from typhoid fever
and Dr. Maag decided to try an experi
ment Respiration had ceased completely
and the body was cold. Direct massage
of the heart was resorted to. The chest
was cut open directly over the heart, and
through tne Incision the physician passed
his hand and seized the heart. He com
menced a series of compressions, -and in
a' short time the heart commenced to
work of Its own accord. The action of
the heart gradually became stronger, but
the man had not commenced to breathe.
Only after the heart had been acting half
an hour did the first 'gasp for air come.
The patient was then assisted in this for
about an hour until finally he was able
to breathe quite freely. At the same time
his cheeks ' began to assume . a natural
color. He lay in this condition for an
other half hour, but without regaining
consciousneB* or appearing to feel the ef
fects of the Incision. Then there was a
reaction and respiration ceased, although
the heart continued to act' eight hours
longer. A second effort -was made to in
duce heart action, but without result â

The sale of season .tickets for the
Henschel series of recitals in February
at the Metropolitan Temple will begin to
morrow morning at Sherman-Clay Hall.
Mr. Russell retired from the platform
in the early '60s, by reason of a severe
nervous shock and appeared 1 only once In
public afterward. ' ,-!
Clark Russell, the writer of sea stories,
and "Landon Ronald," a clever composer
and conductor at the Lyric Theater, Lon
don, are sons of Henry Russell.
Here it was that Russell composed his
ilrst song, "Wind of the Winter Night,"
to the words of Charles Mackey's nne
poem. He was so encouraged by the re
sult that he has been writing songs ever
since. All kinds of stories of his power
over his audiences are told. He pos
sessed the most exquisite gift of sym
pathy and moved his audiences to smiles
or tears with exquisite ease. By his con
certs during the great famine in Ireland
he raised Â£7000 ($35,0U0), which he turned
over to the suffering people. His great
est song. "To the West, to the West,"
was composed about this time,' and part
ly through lts\ inspiration, and with the
help of the Canadian Government, thou
sands of poor Hibernians were helped to
the New World and are now among Its
most honored citizens.
Henry Russell, the singer and sons
writer, composer of "Cheer! Boys, Cheer I"
"The Old Armchair." "O Woodman,
Spare That Tree," "There's a Good Time
Coming, Boys," and the glorious "To the
West, to the West!" is dead.
With the close of the century, on De
cember 13, and at his home In Malda
Vale, the veteran song writer went to his
rest. Eight hundred songs are his con
tribution to the vocal literature of tha
century, and among them classics like the
above mentioned, which have place and
love in the hearts of all the English
speaking people. Mr. Russell was born
in lsUI, says the Sphere, on Christina**
eve, at Sheerness. He appeared on the
stage ot his native town at the age of 3.
As a child of 8 he was singing in a chil
dren's opera at the Surrey Theater. At
10 he was apprenticed to a chemist, but
found hlmseii unsuited to the business,
and in 1525 went to Bologna to study
music. in 1S3S he toured the United
States, which tour was enormously suc
cessful.

White-gloved, with grave, unsmiling
face and tall, slim-walsted figure of court
ly cut, breasted with honorable trinket3
of all sorts and sizes, Strauss steps on
his conductor's throne tne very incarna
tion of dignity. For perhaps five whole
minutes he remains the philosopher, quiet,
inperturbable, but with the second move
ment, his violin probably in hand, the en
chanting lilt and dreamy charm of the
waltz have him at their mercy. The
idol's feet are discovered not of clay bait
quicksilver. The philosopher shamefully
betrays the feet of Pan, and for the rest
of the evening Strauss may be seen foot
ing it featly through waltz, and march,
and polka indifferently, but always with
a certain air of martyrdom, as if driven
thereto by a merciless demon of rhythm.
He actually waltzed in the Chopin "Fu
neral March" to a bit of interpolated
Strauss rhythm.
As a man driven by his own peculiar
genius into sometime distasteful ways, he
is to the full as interesting as he is a*
the leader of the best band of its kind
in the world. He has the all compelling
genius of his famous family, without its
all-absorption. He might have gained
name in other walks of life. Not they.
And the consciousness aevnns forever with
him, a wonder as to the "worth-while
ness" of that which he has chosen, or,
rather, that which chose him. But .we
who listen neither woijjler nor question.
Strauss Is the waltz king, the last of thÂ«
dynasty.
It is with Strauss as with a "pled piper
of Hamelln," compelled to dance to his
own piping, and, furthermore^ compelled
to -pipe. Originally intended for the Con
sular service, he received an academic
training and is a graduate of philosophy.
But early in the sixties his musical Dent
became too strong and hia career as an
orchestral leader began. But the diplo
mat is never forgotten, and the war be
tween musician and statesman is as
pretty a thing in dual personalities as one
may see on any platform.
Sousa may be usefully compared. Their
methods of obtaining results is another
story.

/N /S OU never can tell!
j \ If the average citizen of San
j I Francisco or even the wise
JJ impresario had been invited to
I ' J^T prophesy as to which musical.
C^>V venture, the Strauss or Grau,'
would prove tho more widely
popular here, nine times out of ten the
answer would have been, "Strauss, of
course."
Which shows that one never can tell.
Strauss, with his wcrld-famous orches
tra, which in New York drew an audience
whose surplus meekly availed Itself of tho
front steps of the opera-house in hope of
catching even an echo of the waltz kine's
rhythms; Strauss, who victoriously invad
ed the very citadel oZ the symphony,
Music Hall, in Uostuii; Slniuss. heir of a;i
unbroken line of seventy years* brilliant
triumphs of the aristocracy of tho dance,
in San Francisco finds his Waterloo. He
is in good company, belike, a strange and
various company, but who would ev*r
have prophesied that pleasure-loving,
laughter-lovingr San Frcnclsco would havo
coldly' declined Vienna's magic "invita
tion to the dance';? It is a case for thd
psychological crank, with his damp finger
upon the esthetic pulse of the city. It Is
a case, too, of practical import to ths
Impresario and a study in artistic aber
rations to the musician.
It has been roundly hinted that our
new-found name as a Wagnerlan strong
hold has something to do with the casa.
We are accused of being the nouveau
riche musical, jealous and fearful of our
small new thing in reputations and lu
dicrously persuaded tl:at a bowing ac
quaintance with our former tuneful lovea
would imply the exclusion from the Wag
nerlan visiting list â w.iercon our name is
still wet. Curious, inaeod. would.lt be lft
our native easy catholicity of taste were I
succeeded by a prigtfibhness' a musical
snobbishness, which could give point?
even to Uoston itself, and this happening
rather points that way. It might have
been reasonably supposed, had not every
other house of entertainment been crowd
ed during the we*k, that the ChrlstnuiS
tolls were responsible tor the cool wel
come accorded the Strauss orchestra. Tl>Â«j
raised prices at the California would also
have had to be taken into account wer-
It San Francisco's way to look twice at
a dollar, where her pleasure is concerned.
But, be the reasons wtiat they may, the
Strauss orchestra, which in New York
drew audiences of 5000 people, which was
approved by the foremost musical critics
in the country â Finck. Henderson, Hune
ker, Philip Hale, Krchbicl and Louis El
son among themâ has played here to
empty houses, and orchestra, conductor
and the rest of us are still wondering
why.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Strauss himself, as has been before said,
would have been cheap at the price with
out the band. Of all leaders with whom
we are at all familiar the Viennese con
ductor has the most strikingly picturesque
personality and from a dozen different
standpoints. Mancinelll, master of his
art, with his eminent dignity and abso
lute repose, conceals with calm clever
ness every possible scrap of the machin
ery of conducting. Damrosch, with pos
sibly as much native dignity and genius,
but younger, still permits himself a few
picturesque tricks of the baton wleldcr.
Souea, the monarch of the march, be
tween whom and Strauss the most obvi
ous comparisons arise, is the poseur from
the mathematical part in his military
coiffure to the irreproachable heels of
him. There is an almost indecent lack ot
mystery in his method. A child can st-e
the "wheels go round." His work has the
apparent fpontaneity of the achievements
of a nickel-in-the-slot machine, the mys
tery and subtlety of the performance of a
glass-faced clock. He has the mechanical
perfection of a toy drummer, "correct,
ridiculous, charming," with the most un
affected delight in his own paragonic
graces. His affectation is natural to him,
a second nature. Sousa, without the pol
ished, impeccable, bijouterie of his
method, would be no longer Sousa. And
in spite of all the tricks and frills and
airs of him, how splendidly the march
king does "get there"!
It is in the results of their work, the
color, rhythmic magic, irresistible swing
of waltz and march that Strauss and

When thÂ» cases of Ernest Auguln. R. I*
During the two years live new compa

The report says that by the increase oC
the national- appropriation from $400,000 ta
$1,000,000 for arming and equipping the cit
izen soldiers of the several States, Cali
fornia's allowance will be raised from
$7763 51 to $19,403 73. â¢*whlch amount, with,
the State appropriation, will enable tnÂ«
adjutant general to greatly improve thÂ»
equipment and efficiency of the National
Guard of this State."
The adjutant general recommend* that
members of the National Guard who
served as volunteers In the Spanish war
and re-enUsted in the militia be tfven the
credit of continuous service in the State
organization: that those officers on the re
tired list who entered tne volunteer ser
vice be, after discharge from the United
States service, restored to the retired list
with the rank held by them In the guard
at the time of enlistment in the volun
teers;' that an appropriation be made to>
compile and print 5000 copies of a history
and record of the California volunteers
In the Spanish-American war; that an ap
propriation be made to pay the claims or
companies B and D, Second Infantry, for
services In 1SS7. when sent to Colusa to
prevent the threatened lynching of Polrer.
This Is a claim for $455 37 for pay. trans
portation and subsistence. That the rules
and regulations be codifled and published,
as In some respects they are contradic
tory, in others ambiguous and confusing
and In -some cases obsolete and useless;
that machine gun batteries be organ
ized, one to be attached to each of thÂ»
three brigades; that an appropriation bÂ»
made sufficiently large for the guard to
go into camp for eight days each year;
that an emergency fund be established to.
be used for the pay. travel and subsist
ence of the guard when ordered out In
case of war, insurrection, rebellion or re
sistance to the execution of the laws or
the State, or for other necessary pur
pose, and that a State arsenal bÂ« built at
Sacramento for the safe keeplng^of mili
tary stores and supplies; that a State ar
morer and storekeeper be appointed at a
salary of $60 per month, and that an ap
propriation of $50 a month for rent and
other expenses for each detachment of
the sanitary corps on duty with each of
the five regiments of infantry be made.
A meeting of the newly organized as
sociation of officers of the National Guard
â¢of California will be held In division head
quarters next Saturday night, when of3
cers will be elected and matters for tho
interest of the citizen soldiery will be dis

The report of the adjutant general for
the two years ending June 80. 1900. has
been Issued. It Is a volume of 14* pages,
the smallest Issued In years. An excuse
for this Is that it was cut down by order
of the State Printer. At the date of thÂ»
closing of the report the organtr.eq
strength of the guard was four troops oX
cavalry, fifty companies of Infantry, threa
signal corps and seven divisions of naval
militia, with the general officers and staff
officers, aggregating 4002 officers and men,
organized in one division and three bri
gades. The naval militia numbered at
that time 425 officers and men. Ther*
were 268 officers on the retired list.
The local officers of the National Guard
are very curious to know what recom
mendations Governor Gage win present
In bis message on the subject of the arm
ed force of the State. What he will offer
on that subject may In a measure affect

?>i:vr TORK, Jan. 8.â Speculators Jumped
Into the clock market this morning and put
prices Into a state of violent effervescence.
They culckly eklnm3Â«d the froth at the top
level cf prices to take profit* and attracted so
large a following to the selling tide that the
eer.satlonal opening rains were mostly wiped
out beTcm tte close and in all ca*eÂ« greatly'
reduced. After a day <* violent excitement at
exceedingly wld* fluctuations the market was
decidedly easy in tone at the close and at a
level eeneraily below laet sight. There were
eorue important exception* and there were a
Â¦ouTO'ber of ?â¢;:.â¢ mc-ile rallies of weak stocks on
covering by s-horts. It was a speculator s day,
purÂ« and elrr.;j!e, and whatever subEtantial con
siderations niay have been behind the buying
demand, they were almo6t completely lost Eight
cf In a fremy of speculative excitement. No
fry was too wild cr Improbable to gain
ready credence. The growth of the conviction
c: â¢. St. Paul Is to ; a-f- to the control of the
Northern transcontinental lines has made the
eriecuiative minds <?;Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â» to almost anything: In
the way of rumors regarding railroad combina
tions. Capitalists who havÂ« been Influential in
the Â£:. Paul deal are sur^osed to have addi
tional far-reaching plans. These supposed
plans were made the basis of to-day's extra
ordinary movement. The authorized announce
mÂ«r.t before the close that J. P. Morgan & Co.
hsd secured control of the Central Railroad of
New Jersey in the Interest of the Reading Com
pany offered Eonie basis for the rumors current.
Tte Heading stocks were most prominent !n the
rpc-.lrg cpurt of prices, the first preferred
tnounticg I x>oints, the aÂ«con>} preferred J~4 and
the common 6%. The extreme advance in New
Jersey Central was 5"*. In the heavy buying
at the opening there were advances also of 4
points tn Missouri Pacific.. 3*Â£ In St. Paul, Â»â¢*
tn Erie first preferred, 2Vi In Erie common, 3
In Erie second preferred and tK in Rock Island.
Gales of from 1 to 2 points were numerous all
through tte list. The eagerness of the selling
to take profits caused sudden and violent de
clines, successive sales Jn #ome cases clipping
a half to a -point from prices, until they were
carried bitck to last eight's level or below.
Meantime, thÂ»rÂ« was a growing weakness in
eujrar, Tennwg^ coai, the Rubber stocks and
â¢oral other induitrlals. Th* feverish excitement
on the floor of the exchange was Indescribable.
With prices In a *tat<> of wild fluctuation the
KOSt of Jnisecurlty became overwhelming. Vio
lent advances were follow^ by wide relapses
aod as sudden recoveries. The evid?nt inotabii-
Hj of Drtces Increased thÂ» dlFpositlon to eell.

CHICAGO, Jan. 5.â At the beginning and a^t
the end of the session In the wheat pit bullish
ness of a decidedly- strenuouB order made the
market an exciting: one, while the period be
tween these extremes was marked by a nervous
ness amountire to speculative ague. The
mprket was almost entirely a creation of senti
ment, based on the stock activity and rumors
of Wall street interest In thf local grain mar
ket. May wheat opened l@l-%c higher at 7S*Â£
4.J7&UC under heavy buying pressure wherewith
the rumor connected the name of James IC.
KrÂ«-ne. the New York stock operator, Ar
enormous business was transacted tho llrst ten
minutes', longs scattering to the open mouths
opened to them with such liberality that tht
price of May dropped back to "S^c. Trade be
came more quiet, but feverishly nervous for
the next hour. May rallied to 7S!ic but dropped
back asain. Offerings were light and the price
w&8 gradually worked up again to 79c. At
this mark more profit-talcing, â¢ together with
some short Billing, was attempted. Meanwhile
commission houses had received more buying
orders. The readlnoss with which offerings
disappeared into this quarter alarmed the
bhort Interest, and on a sharp burst of activ
ity May Jumped to 79>4c, high price of the'
prerent season. A reaction to TSVie followed
this bulge, but^the market was aggressively
string. Â»nd the close was I*;t< l'ic higher at
T9HG72%c.
The bull fever spread to corn, as It did to
ether leading speculative markets.
Tlie close was strons with May "Â»c higher
at 78Â»4Â«?78%c.
A biff cash business and the wheat strength
gave oets a boost to-day. May closed %c
higher at 25%c.

Russia has no intention of invading In

Russia's difficulty in maintaining 1 *"* an

likely that any general would enter on an
Indian invasion, defended by British and
native troops, with less that* threei
months* supplies. Skobeioff had two an. I
a half months for use atrair.st tho

would mean "1.0C0.900 tons to carry, for
which something like 500.000 camels would
be required, equal to- the cargo of forty

The .commercial quarter of Chinatown
was In high rlee yesterday .over the fact
that several firms had at last succeeded
in preventing Federal Quarantine Officer
Kinyoun from spoiling any more of their
Imported fish by fumlffatlns It with 111
smelllng drugs.
It has been the custom of Dr. Kinyoun
In his search for bacteria and bacilli in
the cargoes of vessels arriving- here from
China to fumigate dried fish and other
eatables Intended to tickle the ChinesÂ©
palate. A few weeks ago five Chinatown
firms received consignments of dried fish
in tins. Dr. Kinyoun had no authority to
open the tins and he fumigated the out
side merely, but instead of the duty of
three-quarters of a cent per pound thÂ©
Chinese were charged 30 per cent ad va
lorem, that being the duty on fish in tins.
Then a white broker advised the Chinese
to pack their dried fish in zinc, and they
would not have to pay more than the
three-quarter cent per pound rate. This
whs done and the first consignment
passed through the Custom-house yester
day unfumlgated.

When the repairs aro completed she will
probably go into the Mexican trade.
The steam schooner Barbara Henister

Watsr Front Notes.
Tho mail steamer Australia will not get
away for Tahiti until 10 a. m. to-morrow.
She ,was to have sailed this morning, but
the i!cn-arrival of the French mails has
detained her.
Australia Delayed.
There have been many inquiries about
the steamers Titania and Pomona, which
went out In the teeth of Thursday's gale.
The Titania has not had time to reach the
Sound, and the wires to Eureka have been
down for several days. There is not a
doubt, however, but that the Pomona la
eafe In port and will be back in San Fran
cisco before the news of her arrival in
Humboldt Bay has boon telegraphed.
The bar was ptlll rough yesterday and a
number of coasters that made an attempt
to go out came back. The captains, after
looking at the heavy swell that was roll-
Ing in, put about and came to an anchor
age. The big steamer Ilyades started for
Seattle, where she Is to load for Hono
lulu. After getting into the north channel
the captain decided that discretion was
the better part of valcr, so he put about
and came back to port.

From the description given by Danattl
of thÂ© men. Detective Ryan is satis
fied that they are the individuals â¢who re
cently forced another stranger to sign a
check for $150 after they had taken all the
money he had, amounting to about $65.
"I signed the check," remarked Danatti.
when telling his story to Detective Tom
Ryan at police ' headquarters, "as I
thought the fellow meant to kill mÂ© un
less I complied with his demand. After
I had attached my signature to the check
I was promptly ' ushered out of the place
and warned not to Inform the police un
der penalty of being made a subject for
the Coroner." . ,
Apparently dissatisfied with taking all
the money their victim had three bunko
men, who are still at large, compelled J.
Danattl, a recent arrival from Chicago,
to sign a check for $100 at the point of
a pistol. Danattl, who speaks very little
English, says that he was walking along
Market street yesterday morning, when
he â¢was accosted by a well-dressed man,
who, after representing himself as a mil
lionaire merchant of New Tork, asked
iilm to take a walk with him. According
to Danatti's story thÂ© stranger, after
showing him the tenderloin district, took
him to a room on Kearny street Three
men were in the room, engaged in a game
of poker. Danatti was induced to take a
hand, and In a short time he lost all the
money he had. amounting to $10. Evi
dently thinking that ha had more money
thÂ© bunko men dealt him another "hand.
Danatti, satisfied that the three aces
â¢which had been dealt him formed thÂ© "top
hand," bet $100 that he had the winning
cards.
His opponent, of course, held four
deuces, and as Danattl refused to make
the bet good, one of the sharpers sud
denly drew a revolver, and alter threaten
ing to make him a subject for the Coroner
if he refused, forced him to attach his
signature to a check for $100, drawn on a
bank In Chicago, where Danattl has
funds.

FORCED TO SIGN
AT PISTOL POINT
Mr. Hays said he found the very best
of feeling at New Orleans, where a good
deal has been said regarding the new
policy of the company toward that city.
"I ehall make It a point to know some
thing of the pass system. If the privi
leges have bÂ«en abused in the past I have
not vet learned of the fact.
"Will I sign the passes? Well, probably
not. I shall have other things to attend
to."
Mr. Hays Fald this Is his first trip to the
Pacific Coast in twenty vears. He hard
ly recognized the country*! bo great has
been the change. He expressed himself
as pleased with what he had seen of tho
Southern Pacific lines and hÂ© Intends to
make a more thorough Inspection of the
system later on. He also said he would
Interest himself in the affairs of the Pa
cific Mail In bo far as was practicable.
In recard tÂ» the report that he would
bring several Grand Trunk officials here
later he said that such a move was un
likely. At least no plan to that end had
been formulated thus far.
"Well, we will see. I have lots to learn
yet. My policy will be to run thÂ© com
pany as a railroad, not as a political ma
chine. The interests of tne people will
be as much guarded as the interests of the
railroad. If the people are prosperous thÂ«
railroad will be prosperous. We want both
out here."
Asked if he would attend to the distri
bution of passes the president replied:
Mr. Hays talked freely to a Call repre
sentative on his private car yesterday
afternoon. He was told that among thÂ©
many questions which it is expected he
will have to Bolve in his new position nono
is of greater Interest to the people of San
Francisco than the question of taking the
railroad out of politics.
"Is the road in politics?" he Inquired.
Being assured that it was Hays re
plied bluntly:
ajeo Mr. Hays is a director. Regarding
the dispensing with elnecure officials and
the pruning of salaries Mr. Hays desires
to study more closely the situation before
announcing his intentions.
THE NEW" PRE6IDENT OF THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAIL
ROAD.
A* Mr. Hays will be the head of the
Bouthrm PaeiSc, he will also assume
oversight of the Pacific Mail, which com
pany is very closely identified with the
Southern Partf.c and in which company
The n^w president's methods and policy
be broad, liberal and up to date. He
Â¦will etudy the needs of the company. He
will inquire Into the much talked about
political affiliations of the road, and if be
finds there Is a call for a change of at
xnosphere politically he will not hesitate
to make good use of his official position
In a way that will leave no question of
doubt bs> to his views upon the manage
ment of a mc-fiem railroad.
Tne party left New Orleans December
n, the president having spent two days
In the Crescent City. Sablne Pass, <Jal
â¢veeton. Houston and San Antonio were
the principal stopping points on the way
:o I-os Ar:ge!es. A foil day was spent ia
OaJvceton. Work on the Southern Pa
cific's new wharf is progressing rapidly
end it is nearer completion now than It
was before the storm.
Tfce F^rty got into Los Angeles Friday
TT.omlng and a Ftop of only one hour was
made. While Mr. Hays W2S receiving a
delegation of prominent Los Angeles
business men th.e ladies in the party en
joyed a drive through thÂ© city. At Santa
Barbara, which was reached at 1:25
o'clock Friday afternoon, another drive
â¢was taken by the ladies, and then tae
train continued without a stop to Surf,
Â¦where the night was passed. The Jour
ney was resumed at 7:Â§Q yesterday morn
ing. At San Jose President Hays was
criven a warm welcome by Mayor C. J.
Slartln. Postmaster Hawley and a dozen
representative business men of the city.
The train stepped only ten, minutes and
thea carae straight through to this city.
The ccmir.g cf Mr. Hays to the Pacific
Coast Is of unusual interest to San Fran
<risco and in fact the entire State. His
coming means almoet as much to the
community as to the big railroad. Mr.
Hays will find conditions here which per
haps he r.Â«ver met before in gJI his varied
railroad career. That Mr. Hays will bÂ«
Â«Â«qual to the task Is taken for granted by
thoee who know him best. The same rare
rrecutive ability which the new president
Rpplied to the administration of the Grand
Trunk, bis friends say, will not bÂ« found
lacking in his direction of Southern Pa
cific affairs.
The fiwdal train was made up of Fix
fÂ£TE, four of which were occupied by Mr.
3Iavs end Â©facials of the company with
their families. Th* Otsego carried Vice

President Hays a:io f.-unily occupied the
finnfret, the Guadaiupe bringing up the
rear with General Manager Julius Krutt
f chr.itt and wife and tiiÂ«>ir two daughters
and sons. The observation end of Mr.
JCruttschnitfs car was used as a sort of
rendezvous by the party, all of whom
reared in pointing out to the new presi
dent the many objects of interest along
tne j;!cturesque route.

ADDS PERJURY
TO HIS OFFENSE
SAN JOSE, Jan. 6.â About a hundred
city officials and prominent citizens wel
comed the arrival of President Hays and
the first train over the Coast road this
afternoon. When the train pulled Into
the depot Mayor Martin and George M.
Bowman, president of thÂ© Improvement
Club, entered the car and extended a
welcome to President Hays and party.
A few pleasant words were exchanged
and the Mayor said he hoped that at a
later day the people of the city would
bs given an opportunity to tender a more
formal reception. President Hays re
sponded. When through trains begin run
ning a celebration probably will be held
her*. . 'Â¦
Mayor Martin Extends Greeting to

the removal of headquarters to Houston
and the transfer of a portion of the com
pany's steamship freight business to
Galveston. Much of this. It appears, was
made necessary by quarantine and th?
company had no redress or relief save to
act as It did.
In regard to Senator Clark's proposed
new road between Salt I^ake City and Los
Angeles Mr. Hays said that all he. knew
about the project was what he had seen
In the papers. He saw no reason why the
Southern Pacific should entertain any un
easiness, at least not until the much
talked about road had been started. From
what he could glean from the map he did
not consider that the country warrant rd
another road.
As the president of the Southern Pacific
Mr. Hays will not only be the chief ex
ecutive officer but win take a hand in the
financial affairs of the company. He will
authorize the purchase of new rolling
stock and negotiate tr-.e leasing of branch
lines; he will authorize his subordinates
In their actions ronc.pniing rates and. in
fact, will be responsible to the board of
directors for everything: concerning the
operation of the system, earnings, ex
penses and plans.
Â« Mr. Hays was born at Rock Island,
111., and has been In tne railroad business
twenty-seven years. He began at the agre
of 19 as clerk In the St. Louis freight of
fice of the old Atlantic and Pacific road
at a salary of $40 a month.
He began pushinp himself the day he
went to work. In March of the following
year he had pushed himself from the $40
a month position Into a place In the audi
tor's office, which paid $50 a month. With
in a year he was a clerk In the general
superintendent's office with a salary of $75
a month. In 1877 he became the private
secretary of the general manager of the
Missouri Pacific at St. Louis, and here
he learned how a railroad was governed.
In 1884 Mr. Hays became the private sec
retary of General Manager Talmage of
the Wabash, and two years later he was
made assistant general manager of that
road with a salary of $200 a month. A
year later he became the general man
ager of the "Wabash system, and his sal
ary went up to $12,000 a year. By this
time he was attracting attention In rail
way circles the country over. People were
beginning to talk about "that man Hays."
He continued In this position six years,
and the Wabash system Improved In a
way that made the general manager much
In demand by railroads which needed m*n
such aa the Wabash had found in the
hour of Its need. Among these roads was
the Grand Trunk. The Grand Trunk peo
ple eent to St. Louis for Mr. Hays, and
In January, 1896, he became manager of
the Canadian road, holding that position
until he resigned to become president of
the Southern Pacific.
