The custom of excnansln? amatory ad
dresses between valentines on St. Valen

luded. Is a very old one. Many of the old
English po.ets, such aÂ» Chaucer and Spen

style of composition. Lydgate? famous la
England as a poet Ions before ths Inven
tion of printing, also wrote many valen
tines, and the same Is true ot Athelstan*
Wade, an Anglo. Saxon poet of tho tlm*
of Richard I. One of tho latter** produc

On February 16 of the same year-two
days laterâ he again writes: ''I find that
Mrs. Pierce's little girl Is my valentine,
she having drawn me, which I am not
sorry for. It easing me of something moie
that I must have Riven to others. But
here I do first observe the fashion of

that Pierce, who drew my wife, did draw

upon a chosen valentine to give a present

RULES FOR MILITARY CONDUCT IN THE FIELD
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
5\j*itj curiously Interesting matter
has lately been unearthed from an
old order book of the Twentieth
Rf-tffrm nt. the "Midden boys." now
the Lancashire EusIIIers. Which emanated
from the heroic soldier Wolfe when
colonel of the regiment, about 1750. Their
bearing upon military conduct In the field
makes thorn very distinctly topical Just
now, say:? the London Express.
"Whoever shall throw away his arms In

Fioned officer or soldier (unless It appears
they are so damaged as to be useless),
either under the pretense of taking up
others that are of a better sort or for
any. other cause whatsoever, must expect
to be tried by a court-martial for the
crime.
"The death of an officer commanding a
company or platoon shall be no excuse
for the confusion or misbehavior of that
platoon; for. while there is an officer or
non-commissioned officer left alive to com
mand. no man is to abandon his colors or
betray his country.
"Neither officer, non-commissioned of

out on any account whatsoever, although
the rest of the troops should do it, until
they are ordered to charge with their
bayonets; in that case, and when they are
on the point of rushing on the enemy the
battalion may give a warlike shout and
rush in. â¢
"The soldier who takes his musket from
his shoulder and nretends to begin the
battle without orders? will be put to death
that Instant. 'The cowardice or irregular
proceeding of one man is not to put the
whole in danger. Â¦
"The poldler who quits his rank or of
fers to fly is Instantly to be put to death
by the ofllcer who commands the platoon.
A soldier does not deserve to live who
will not fight for his King and country.
"If a non-commissioned officer or pri
vate man is missing after an. action and
Joins his. company afterward â¢ unhurt, he
wlll.be reputed a coward and a. fugitive
and will be tried for his life.
"If we attack a Body less In extent than
the battalion, the platoons upon the wings
must be careful to " direct "their nre
obliquely so' as 'to strike the enemy. The
officers aro lo inform the soldiers of their
platoons before the action begins where
they are to direct their fire, and they are
to ta^e a good aim to destroy their adver
saries.
â¢ "There is no necessity for firing very
fast. A cool, well-leveled fire, with the
pieces carefully loaded. Is nitir-h more de
structive and. formidable than the o>iick

take their orders entirely from tho ofllcer
of their platoon, and he is to give them
with all possible coolness and resolution.)
The misbehavior of any other corps will
not effect this battalion, because the of
ficers are determined to give the strongest
proofs of their fidelity, zeal and courage,
in which the soldiers will second them
with their usual spirit. :â¢'Â¦
"The men should consider that they rfre
upon the point of entering into a war for
the defense of their, country; â¢" that a

poor defense to a State; but their^yirtue,
courage and obedience are a'lsure guard-Jo,

ways be ready to perform: their. part with
honor and spirit, and not give themselves
up to any excess or irregularity. In, times
like these both officers and soldiers should
particularly exert .themselves in 'every
part of tho duty, and show their country
that they deserve its esteem and admira
tion by their zeal, fidelity and valor."
The principles on which the British sol
dier should fight vary little to this day
from those Inculcated by General Wolfe."
rouowing entry: "This evening my w:re

reck that she hath above Â£150 worth
of jewels of, one kind or other; stnd I am
glad of It, for it Is tit the wretch should
have something to content herself with."
Good Mr. Pepys here uses the wori
wretch as an endearing term. Admirers
of Sir' Walter' Scott -will remember th^t
he also alludes to this custom of giving
valentine presents, and will readily re
call the passage In the "Fair Maid oC
Perth," In which he 'describes the little
St. Valentine's day gift which the mlghtv
amorer, Henry Smith, had prepared for
-his valentine, the good and beautiful
Catherine Glover: "It was a small ruby
cut into the form of a heart, transfixed
with a golden arrow, and was inclosed in*
a small purse of links of the finest work
in steel, as if it had been designed for h
hauberk to a kins. Round *bo verge of
the purse were these words:
Through mail shirt?.
'This device has caused the armorer
some thought, and he was much satisfied
with his own composition, because if ,
seemed to imply that his skill could de-J
fend all hearts -saving his own." 'Â¦;'.
In many parts of England and Scotlanly
it is still customary, as' it, has been' for
many centuries, for young men. and ' wo-.

ST. Valentine's Day, which falls on
February 14, had Its origin with
the Romans, who, a great many
centuries before Christ, held great
feasts, known as the- Lupercalla, in honor
of Pan and June, during- February, at
which tablets bearing younng women's
names were drawn out of a box by young
men. Each person drawing became the
faithful attendant of her whose name ha
Tiad drawn until thp next Lupercalia. Tho
close association thus engendered often
resulted In marriage. There was a popu
lar superstition at that time, which, in
deed, stttl finds credence In the minds of
many people, that birds selected their
mates on the fourteenth day of February,
and it was for that reason that the
Romans held their matrimonial lottory In
connection with the ceremonies of the
Lupercalia on that date. It was because
the early Christian fathers found their
hardest task in the conversion of the
heathen to be to persuade them to aban
don their heathen festivities that they
endeavored to divest all such observances
of undue solemnity, while retaining all
their social aspects and associating them
with seme persons or things pertaining
to the church. They replaced the Luper
calia with St. Valentine's day, therefore.
thus retaining the date of the ancient
festival and connecting it with Christian
ity through a. great saint, who BuCCerstl
martyrdom in the third century. He was
first beaten with clubs while a priest at
Rome, where his remains now rest in the
cfturch of St. Praxedes. So this excellent
man never either directly or indirectly
bore any relation whatsoever to the ob
servances and ceremonies peculiar to the
day devoted to him. The good churchmen
found it Impossible to persuade the com
mon people to entirely abandon any cere
mony to which they had become deepjy
attached. Despairing, therefore, of abol
ishing the matrimonial lottery of thj
Lupercalia, they modified its form. an<l
endeavored to give it. a rejigious character
by substituting the names nf particular
taints to be drawn as valentines Instead
of the names of men and women. From
this ancient usage is derived the custom,
still occasionally observed in come Catho
lic countries, of -selecting on St. Valen
tine's day for the ensuing year a patron
saint who is called a valentine. Eut the
young men and maidens finding â¢ little
amusement in drawing out the names of
dead and gone taints* eoon relapsed Into
their old custom of drawing each other,
and even at the present In many of the
rural districts of England and Scotland
It is customary on the eve of St. Valei.
tine's day for the young people of both
Kxe* to draw lots for a. valentine. As trie
men draw from a bag containing " tba
r.ames of the maidens, while the latter
draw from one eonta'nir.z the names of
the men, it generally happens that 'each
person has two valentines, but the younjj
men regard themselves much more strong
ly bound to the valentine they have drawn
than To the one who has drawn them.
If. as (sometimes happens, a. young man
and woman should each chance to dra.v
the other it is regarded as absolutely cer
tain that they are destined to wed and
must not, under any circumstances, per
mit their attentions or affections to cen
ter elsewhere. During the reign of Charles
II. as we learn from that most interesting
and curious record of the domestic life of
that period preserved for us in the diary
of Mr. Pepys. married people were equally
eligible with single ones for the lotteiy
of St. Valentine's eve, and any one chosen
for a valentine was in honor bound to
give a present to the person choosing him
or her.
On St. Valentine's <j a v. 1K7, Mr. Pepys
writes: "This morning came up "to my

DAYTaking some bits of cotton-In her hand

as It left . her flew through the several
feet of distance which separated her from
us. rave a stinging touch and rebounded
bodies.. To test this hold your hand In
front of you, and you will see that nq
light comes through It; that is, apparent
ly none. In truth, thouph. the marvelous
X-rays are passing through your hand,
and not only through It. but through your
eyes as well, and, strangest of all, they
*go right on through your eyes and out of
the back of your bead, to be lost In
space. \
"Now, the retina of the eye Is only sen
sitive to those rays which stop on it. and
bo cause the sensation of sight. If they
pass through the eye- and on beyond it Is'
as water going through a sieve â there is
nothing to show for it. But now see tha
difference.
' "Hold between your eye and the hand In
front of the light this fluoroscope, which
Is cardboard coated with a solution of
uranium; now you see the light through
the blackened cardboard and the hand
both. That Is because the rays, which be
fore passed on through your eyes unlnter
cepted, have been so changed, thickened
or slowed down, as It were, by passing
through the. uranium that when they
reach the retina they are arrested by it
and produce an Image. It is just as though
the water which had previously passed
through the sieve had been frozen into
hail, and being changed could be checked
in its fall by the mesh of the sieve and so
made evident fo the censes.
"Now, to show you the amount of en
ergy It requires to create this -light, I will
connect myself .with the current which is
producing it." â¢ Â¦ . -. ;
Of course, this is not scientific, and it Is
no part of the X-ray proper to see a
human being surcharged with the pent-up
forces : of lightning until the hair bris

through the thickest of woolen garments,
even as it. would through lace, and shivers
your flesh In streaks as she points it at
different' parts.
to her again as though Its mission werÂ»
accomplished.
Taking a skull In her hand the fires
were immediately transferred to It and
- glowed and hissed from the ghastly sock
ets as no human eyes had ever done.
I 'Â¦ Then reconnecting the X-ray tube with
the machine, she stepped In front of tho
light, and holding the fluoroscoplc plat*
before her said: "Look through me,
please." There before us then was but
the misty form of the woman, c skeleton
eKadowed through it. and the darker form
of the heart, drumming away at tha
march of life.
Besides this and a few corset steels and
buttons there was nothing to be seen but
the outlines of the phantom.
That Is the play side of X-ray business.
In another room were stacks of radio
graphs, each the record of an accident
to some unfortunate human being, 'who
has been photographed to show the loca
tion of fractures, dislocations, bullets
and all manner of foreism bodies.
Some of them were of soldiers homa
from the war* with Mauser bullets In
body, head, or limbs, for permanent
souvenirs. Others were even more Inter
esting for the reason that they were the
records of well known local people who
have figured as the victims of pi.no! shots
and more than one has a mystery attach
ed to it that none but the principals will
ever know.
Physicians are coming more and more
to use the X-ray to aid them in their
search for foreign bodies and when it
comes to be generally known how much
painful probing may be avoided by so
doing, nearly every subcutaneous opera
tion will be preceded by examination with
the ray. which lights up the Interior of
men until they look like campaign trans
parencies.
â¢ Another class of radiographs of which
many are taken are those that show ab
solutely nothing injured or misplaced.
One such case was of a child whosa
mother was sure It had swallowed a quar
ter. The X-ray photograph showed no
quarter and mother and child went away
contented. 'y. Â¦ "
Other people are sure that they have
a -break, a dislocation, or that the doctor
has forgotten and left some of bis Instru
ments In them. A clear radiograph of
. their bodies showing air in good shape
puts them at ease immediately and en
ables them to understand the mysterious
apparent realism of hypochondria:
The I ' many successes of Elizabeth
Flelschman have brought her to the atten
tion of the surgeon general of the United
States army and she has made many
examinations of soldiers for the military
hospitals. That, of course, shows that
she Is a scientist and not a witch, but
if she isn't a witch she can at least do
what witches couldn't and she can show
things that make, falrv tales seera coza
monslace by comiaxlaon,
the light Itself really Is. Miss Flelschman
in illustrating this said: "When a person
.looks at a Crookes tube producing its
rays he â¢ sees a yellow-green phosphores
cence, such as that which lights the glow
worm to its mate: but that is not tha
X-ray, It Is merely another light wh:cn is
engendered In the process, and hae not the

produced the light the quality of thÂ«
rays would be changed, and some of them
would show through bones and all, some
through the heart ana liver and others
would only pnss through the most trans
parent part of the body, such as the lungs.
In this way, by changing the intensity of
the electric currents, all the different
parts of the body may in turn be brought
Into sight and either ' studied . ocularly
through the tluoroscope or radiographed
by posing the subject in front of a sen
sitized plate.
In a radiograph every fine distinction
between light and shade has an important
value, and one must not discard them
because they do not show out clear and
black as silhouettes. In the photograph,
or radiograph, rather, of the frog the
bones are shown most clearly, and about
them is the fleshy structure. The lurgs
are indicated by two light spots, showing
that they were inflated with air when the
exposure was made. TheTieart shows as
a darker spot, and the whole view Is not
unlike what one would see In looking
through the human body with a fluoro
ecope.
The tones of birds are difficult to show
In a radiograph for the reason that; being
made to float In the air, they are light and
thin and hollow. The photograph of the
wild duck, while it plainly shows the
leaden Ehot, small as they are, well illus
trates the difficulty in securing the out
lines of the filmy skeleton. â¢
A girl wizard is a novelty. Heretofore
the wizard business has been monopolized
by ancient gentlemen with sunken eyes
that peered from beneath bushy, grizzled
brows; ' who spoke strange allegorical
speeches from mouths that were hidden
somewhere in the midst of flowing-beards
of snowy hair. San Francisco's sorceress
does not deal in black magic nor'in mys
teries. It Is all clear, cold science, and
that Is the best of it. Any one can go
into a dark closet in a dark room and tell
you that he is performing wonder" ;
or he can get on a stage fifty feet away
and surround himself with mirrors,
screens and wires and. do the same thing.
But to let the spectator perform the trick
himself and feel that he is the magician
know it, in fact, by the demonstrations of
his own senses, Is a very different magic
indeed, and is the sort that is of worth.
Would you like to see what kind of a
heart your best girl has? To look at her
real, true heart and see it beat?â a little
faster perhaps when you are looking at
it. There, dim in the mist about It, yet
plain enough to make you feel that you
might place your finger upon It if you
dared to meddle with * the secret of life
which Is throbbing before you.
It is a very funny fact, but you are 'ever
so much better acquainted with a' person
when once you have seen straight through
uem. It beats a heart to heart talk all
hollow for establishing really confidential
feelings. A man, or a woman either, can
never seem bo stern or forbidding to you
when you have oncÂ«? Â¦ learned by ocular
demonstration that he or she Is only a
sort of a human fog after all. .
The word X-ray has been heard so fre
quently that, most people think. they know
all about it, but even the experts who pro
duce and use it frankly . admit tha; al
though they can do that much, yet they
have, not the faintest conception of what
lizabeth rz.T?<*crmM*. Â«â¢ â¢*Â«Â»
p 3 is best known. Is more of a witch
, I 1 than any ancient dame who ever
flew over the chimneys Â¦with a.
black cat on a broomstick.
She lives In a world of phantoms and
mysteries. She looks through people as
â¢we do through Jellyfish and they appear
to her formless and ghostly as the things
we see In dreams. It is her business to do
that, for Fhe has devoted her life to inves
tigating the interior of the human race
by means of the light of the cathode ray.'
The very strange fact Is that ah animal
a_nd vegetable substances are transparent.
You can eee through a man, a desk, a
table, a book or a floor if you have but
the right light and the cathode ray Is of
that kind. It shows that we anil all of our
creations are but bubbles of the earth,
with no more of realitv about -s than
there la to c kinetoscope show.
It must have been womanly curiosity
that took Miss Flelschman into her ex
periments In radiography and othe.
branches of science, which are specially
Illumined by the Roentgen ray, for there
Is nothing which is farther from the gen
eral field of woman's work than the mass
of mechanical, electrical, chemical and
physiological knowledge required to en
able one to correctly locate a needle which
has got Itself lost somewhere in a human
hayetack.
Curiosity is the motive power with most
ecientlsts anyway, and it was at a lecture
on the subject of X rays, given four years
ago by Professor Van der Naillen of San
Francisco, that started Miss Fleischman
on her interesting: career. Her curiosity
Â¦was aroused, and here was an unlimited
field for its satisfaction. The Chinese
jepresent curiosity by two characters
combined â a woman and. a keyhole. Now
â¢with the X ray there Is no necessity of
confining yourself to the limited field of
view which a keyhole presents. It is Just
as easy to see through the closed door or
the wall either, for that matter, unless it
liTof brick. Floors are particularly trans
parent and afford an excellent view of the
flat below if it is properly illuminated and
you have a flucroscope. which is a magic
eyeglass, without which the true X ray
is invisible.
From the time that she heard that lec
ture her life was devoted to the Btudy of
the marvelous light which is rapidly
clearing up the mysteries of our life. She
spent days and nights peering through
people and animals, watching pulsing
hearts and swelling lungs. She studied
the anatomy of the living man instead of
the dead, as doctors do, until she was as
familiar with It as with her own face.
Chloroformed cats and bats, lizards,
frozs and snakes were all in turn placed
under the influence of the light and its
effect* studied until It was possible to
correctly pause the amount of exposure
necessary to make photographs through
the various densities of animal tissue
Â¦which are encountered.
The radiograph of a frog which is given
herewith Is one of the most wonderful
things in ltÂ» way wiuch has ever been
made and was the first which showed
that the X ray could be so used as to
produce Illuminations of the different in
ternal organs as well as of the bony sys
tem. tVben the ray was first discovered
It was not well under control, and only
.the shadow* of the bones could be ob

known in a foreign country, and the Par

crowd were wildly enthusiastic over the
Sousa marches and the characteristic
"rag-time" melodies that the band played
with so much spirit. At the conclusion

that It was due to the electric, currents

rt S it better to sleep with the head high
or low? This is a auestion which man
ii ufacturers of bedclothes apparently
answered long ago by announcing au
thoritatively that no one In his senses
would 'think of lying down to sleep unless,
he has a pillow and a bolster under h's
head. Now, however, a French scientist
comes forward and says that any one
who rests his head on a pillow and bol
ster while he is sleeping Is slowly but
surely committing suicide. This scientis:
is-M.-A. Feret and it was .at the recent
meeting of the French Society of Hygiene
, that he expressed his heterodox views on
the subject. . Â¦â¢.â¢-.-

made lightly, but is the . result of long

The next step,' he Bays, is to remove the
pillow, for not until then will the circula
tion of the blood be a* free as it .should
be. .
In further explanation he says that the
pillow and bolster keep the head and neck

ij many and such varied experiences
jl during his brief stay In New York
that h* was beginning to look back
at his old life Â»t home as a port of vague
dream and to Imagine himself a thorough
paced New Yorker and a man about town.
The Bad Boy viewed this frame of mind
â¢with delicht. and repeatedly assured the
Old Groccryman that the latter was "the,
real thine" and that he was developing
tr.to a dead-game 5port- And this increased
the old man's growing self-esteem to such
Â»n extent that there was no living in thÂ»
came- house with him.
The Bad Boy. coming up from Wall
rtreet late In the afternoon, found the Old
Groceryrr.an the center of a delighted
throng: at the hotel bar.
The old man was telling stories of his
Cay life In New York, and at the end of
Â«ach Ftory he would Insist on every one
present stepping up to the bar and having
a Ftlmulant. This made the rrnwd clamor
for Fhorter and more frequent stories. The
old man would comply with readiness, and
rs each anecdote ended would turn to the
barkeeper and Ray sternly:
"Barkeep, fulfill your manifest destiny
In life by replenishln* every glass in

The Bad Boy enjoyed the scene hugely
until he found that the drinks were all
betas charged up to his own account, and
then bo thought It was time to Interfere,
and he rut his old frk-nd out of the herd
<as lie expressed it) and lo<l him off to
their own apartments.
But what he imagined to be hi* great
eucrr-5s as a raconteur woke the Old Gro
ceryman's sporting instincts, and on
reaching his rnnm he suddenly turned to
the Bad Boy and said:
"Fay: Do you know to-morrow's Valen

Â«-c!ohrate it at all. or don't It come so far
East?"
"Of course they celebrate it." replied
the Had Boy. f*It"Â« celebrated better In

"Sure, I've heard, again and again,"
protested the Oid Groceryman, unwilling
to seem ignorant concerning any item of
lntereFt in the affairs of the metropolis,
"but I guess I'll get you to tell m<* all
over againâ Just to see if you really know
as rau<'h about it as I do."
"Well," began the Bad Boy. "in the first

gretting for the moment Â¦ that he had
claimed to know all about It.
"Why. when a man wants to win a girl's

The demand for words and expressions
to relieve overwrought fueling seems to
be felt by all humanityâ Hoosler human
ity as well as otherwise.
An examination Of some of th* folTc
words and phrases that have been cur
rent in Indiana will reveal many things
of historical interest. Think, for example,
of the testimony of former economic con*
ditions contained in the expression "sharp
bit." In the early days there was but lit
tle or no change in the country, nor was
it convenient for traders comjng from
New Orleans and elsewhere to bring with
them any other than the larger coins. la
order to make sinÂ«llÂ«r change the settlers
cut. these coins Into pieces, and tnesa
pieces were known a<< "sharp bits."

for boiler, "kittle" for kettle. *'h Isted
for hoisted, "j'lnt" for Join, "ruinated
for ruined, etc.
Person* who have lived In the rural dis
tricts of the State will recognize the fol
lowing very common expressions; "All
git-out." as in "It's a-rainln' to beat all
git-out;" "passel." as in "They're Jlst a
passel of fools;" "hump your stumps," as
"Hump your stumps, ole woman, and git

mean, low down. Its use Is by no means
confined to Indiana.
The word "mosey." frequently heard In
such expressions â¢ as, "He moseyed off
down the crick." has the Hoosier stamp,
but la met. with elsewhere. The diction
aries which confine K are curiously in er
ror as regards Its meaning. According to
them it means to move off quickly, to get
out, to light out, to hustle. Eut in Cen
tra! Indiana, at Ip.ist.it means to saunter
along, to walk slowly along, as if with
no particular destination in view, and is
rarely or never used 1n the sense given
by the dictionaries. Most accounts of Its
derivation are equally erroneous. One au
thor tells a story of a defaulting Postmas
ter named Moses, tvho teft between two
days, and he absurdly connects the word
with the name and manner of flight. The
word .possibly cornea from the Spanish
Imperative verb, "vamos." go: I. e.. it -In
a Variation of "vamoose." which Is sÂ«o de
rived, and which has some of the mean
ings ascribed to., "rnosey."
Probably some, if not all, cf the follow
ing word* and phrases are more frequent
ly used In Indiana than elsewhere: "Heap
sight." as In "more ground by a heap
sight"; "juberous'." ae In "I felt mighty
juoerous about crossin' the rivpr": "Jam
boree." in the' sense of a "big tfme":
"flabbergasted." 1. e. t exhausted: "garg
ley,"'l. e.. awkward: "I mind that," for
"I remember that"; "bumfoozled."' I. e..
"rattled"; "whangdoodle." as In "Are you
going to. the whangdoodlo to-night?"
But the individuality of a dialect Is, in
,fact. â¢ far more a result of accent qr of
pronunciation than of the -possession of
expressions peculiar to itself. As has just
been pointed out. Indiana has but few
provincialisms that are peculiarly her
own.* But where else than. In Indiana
would one hear' the long-drawn flatness
of the "a" In Â«such words as "sassers,"
"saft." "parsnips." etc.? Or where else
would one hear such a sentence as "I

speech consists in the abbreviation or con
tortion of words.- In Indiana It Is common

PECULIARITIES OF DIALECT IN THE HOOSIER STATE
ARTICULARLY marked Is the dls-
Xfs-J) similarity between the folk speech
\\y^ ot the northern part of tho State
i and that'of the southern part. TJÂ»e
settlers In the. north, cams .mainly from
New England. Pennsylvania. New York
and Northern Ohio, s.nd in consequence
there exists in the north a strong Yankee
twang. Those in the southern part catne
mainly from Virginia. Maryland. South
ern Ohio; the Carolinas. Kentucky and
Tennessee, and the idiolect show? ; the
Boutherhlnfluence, containing some points
of similarity. to the negro and the "poor
white" or "cracker" dialect.
The expression "right smart.", as in the
sentence. "He has a right smart chance
of corn,", is an illustration of the dluslm
llarlty. The expression is used generally
in Central-. and Southern Indiana, but is
rarely met with farther north. It la worth
noticing that while "right," In the sense
of "very," Is so much used in the South
as tq be considered by some writers a
Southern provincialism. -It is as well de
scended" as most English _ words. The
psalms have "I myself ' will Wake right
early."- . '
Not only has folk speech never been
uniform '.throughout Indiana, but exact
geographical bounds cannot be ; given to
the Hoosler dialect. It does not end with
States lints, but extends beyond them into
Kentucky, Ohio,' Michigan and Illinois,
gradually becoming modified and shading
oft into, other .dialects. Much the same
may be said in regard to the other dia
lects extending into Indiana. Doubtless,
also, in many States farther. West there
are colonies Â« of Â¦ transplanted Hoosiers
where the "dialect is spoken in almost its
original purity, while all over tho United
States expressions of Hoosler birth havo
beeomo domiciled.
The fact is. it has always been true, and
never more so than tn these days of rapid
communication and shifting population,
that , In nothing 1 is the student of folk
speech 60 liable to error as in-assigning
geographical limits to a word or phrase.
Our local dialects,.: from which â¢, we get
many. of our folk .words and phrases, are
pretty thoroughly mixed.
For example,' take, the familiar word
"tote," a word which we know did not
originate In Indiana, yet which has be
come a part of Hoosler dialect. Most per-
sons, if questioned as to the origin and
range of this Â¦word, would doubtless, con-,
nect it with tho negro, and certain it la"
that the negroâ especially the' negro In
dialect storiesâ uses . thÂ« word freely. As
a matter of fact. ho\vever, the word was
in use in .Virginia at least as early as 1677,
when thero. were four times more white
bond servants than there were' negroes.
There are old, abandoned post roads In
Maine, where negroes were unknown, that
went by tho name of "tote roads." and,
furthermore, the word "tote" was a com
mon one in England during the seven
teenth century. The conclusion mu3t,
therefore, be that "tote" is not of African
origin, nor Is its use conlined to localities
where negroes are found.
"Cantankerous" is .another word often
met with in." Hoosler dialect, but by no
means conlined to the narrow bounds of
our State. Thackeray speaks of a- "can
tankerous humor." Charles Egbert Crad
dock (Miss Murf ree>. in her story, "Tho
Casting Vote." puts into the mouth of tho
Coroner tho sentence, "He's ez hardheart
ed, an' tyrannical, an' perverse, an 1 can
tankerous a critter ez e,ver lived.'-' Even
Chaucer makes use of the word . "con
teke."- from which "cantankerous" Is
probably derived. ., â¢ .
So wide, indeed. Is the geographical dis
tribution of most folk words and phrases
â¢that; while taking the United States .over,
one can. collect Â¦ great numbers of collo
qulallsms. It Is extremely 'difficult to find
words or phrases that aro confined to a
single -dialect. The; fact "'is, the mixing
process has been so effective that mos,t
provincialisms have ceased to be provin
cial.' The writers of this article axe com
pelled to confers, and they take no shame
to themselves for so doing, that In spite
of considerable pearch they have been un
able to find a single provincialism which
they would be willing to assert Is at pres
ent confined to Indiana alone. . .
"Wants out" and "wants in." In such

MR. BROWSER'S TRIBULATIONS.
HE JOINS A BOWLING CLUB
AND TAKES HIS FIRST LESSON
warmth welcomed, and was told tnm .he
â¢Irst thing In order was to take a drink.
It' came out soon after he had swallow-d
his glass that he was attacked with decay
of the muscular system, and by advice he
took another. The twenty men at the
club that evening were all thoughtful,
Uind-hearted men. and when Mr. Bowser
got his coat and vest off and his suFpenri
ers tied around his [waist and Was ready
for bowling, they suggested that he have
a little something to drink to take the
stiffness out of his shoulders. When he
rolled his first .ball it jumped out of the
alley and knocked a colored boy Into the
mldd.e o* next week and then crashed,
through * window, and some enthusiastic
individual siiRgested cocktails. His. soc
oad remained .on the alley and jumped
over the pins and knocked the s:cte of the
house out, arid that incident created thirst
for more drink.
Mr. Bowser was Ilmherer on his lees and
Feeintr twenty-four phis and three or four
alleys when he mad* ready to roll his
third ball. He meant to mako it a win
ner. He pot a firm grip and swung It I*
and fro. and. then took a shor: run an-i
let her j;o. The action caused him to wit
down on the waxy planks-wlth a jar that
shook his teeth in their sockets, and he
h*>"rt that he must carry th? ' victorious
ball with him to show Mrs. Bo'wspr. and
as he seemed Inclined to be crusty about
It. he was permitted to have his own way.
He departed v.'ith his coat and vest on em
arm and the ball under the other, and half
an hour later the sleeping Mrs. Bowser
was awakened by a racket which scared
her. haÂ»f to heath." Some one was moving
about on the floor below, and there nerÂ«
hlcooughlng and chuckling: and gurgling;
ShÂ«^ threw on her wrapper and. descend
ing, found Mr. . Bowser had lighted thÂ«
gas and was just about to begin' bowling,
lie was hatless, coatless anl vcstless, and
he was weaving about on hi* legs*.
"What on earth alls you?" she. tlemand

."Nnzzlr. all? me-nozzln tall!" he thickly

"Now, 7Â«n. .everybody sntand ashldo

down the pnrlc after tha cat. creating a

on his faco, he sank down on the floor and
murmured:
"Mlshus Bowser, . I'll roll you" t'r. er

of er shots I made to-nicht. Knocked

"An* here's y*er life preserverâ put hit

yez liable to go overboard, with the boat
an' the whole of us!"
"Are yez neither sugar ner salt?" quer
ied one. "'Cause If yez be, yez'U sure get
melted afore we* come ashore."
I was hoisted through the air as though
my one hundred and thirty-eight pounds
of avoirdupois were no â¢ more than a
feather's weight; and found myself being
carried through the rushing water. An
other hoist and I was pitched Into the
boat and given a seat at the front The
seven Bailors .laughed.
"How are you going to grt to the boat?"
he asked. "You will get wet; if you want
to go aboardâ here, I will carry you!"
A hard row of ten minutes or so com
pleted the warming-up practice, and the
boat made her way again to shore. As
her white tip came over the last wave
the crew dropped their oars and bounded
out. waist deep, bracing themselves
against the inpouring torrents, and strug
gling to control the boat. But the Gold
en Gate was swept from their grasp and
dashed upon the sand.
The captain In his big rubber boots
waded ashore.
Four pairs of oars struggled against
the beat of the ocean. The trim white
boat rose over the wave only to be dashed
back again. Three times were the com
mands given and ttie boat forced out Into
the roaring foam before the Golden Gate
â¢was launched; then like a white swan
Ehe rose and fell, taking the rolling waves
as they came falling upon her, and the
eight oars lifting and dropping, sending
the boat forward between the waves in
long, ewirt leaps. Further out the swells
came regular and the Golden Gate cir
cled widely, rising perpendicularly to
mount the rushing masses of water, and
dipping down gracefully beyond It out
of Bight until the swell had passed.
Out of the sound of the rushing waves
the voices of the men came back indis
tinctly. The captain was giving the com
xnanfls.
"All together, lads! Ship oars! Give
â¢way! Harder on the starboard! Give
â¢way all!"
With the final swing the "Golden Gate"
rose high Into the air. pitched out from
the boat wasron and splashed Into the
angry waves. Captain Varney and seven
men leaped into the water, staggering
against the Incoming mountains of sea,
and clambered over the eides of the toss-
Ing boat, taking their places beside the
oarlocks.
"Yo-oh. heave, ho-oh heave, yo-oh! Now
Â¦with her, lads! Yo-oh, yo-o-oh, heave!"
THE waves were rolling mountain
high, lashing themselves Into a
foam against the sands below the
Cliff House. It was 10 o'clock in. the
â¢morning, on the day of the life cavers'
weekly drllL
"They won't go out this morning," said
a. bystander; "it's too rough."
Eut they did. Rough water was what
the men of the Government service were
looking for, and the rougher the better
practice for them, whether or not there
Ehould be a loss of life among them.
Down the hill from the station came
the boat waeon, drawn by two heavy
horsee. In the teeth of a biting wind the [
crew In their white canvas uniforms
leaped to their places and as the horses
backed up to the edge of the lashing wa
ter they worked together with a ewing
and a cry.
. ;Â¦ away. C There was a - rough â¢ ten : minutes
| setting over the first breakers. .. We were
beaten- back twice, but the' eight strong
- oarsmen buffeted steadily until the half
dozen shore - rollers were; climbed. .' Then
we went cutting through the* water, rising '

the other Bide like 'the flight of; the' swal
low. 'Â¦ Further out we met ; the big swellsâ
madly rolling mountains of water. When
each one was upon u s there came the
clear, ; firm order { of the"; captain, "Alto
gether lads; give way, port side; look out!
Over she -goes!" The bow of the Golden
> Gate, shooting Â¦ upward perpendicularly,

â¢ down *Â¦ gliding from the Â¦ top ' and out Into ,

Presently a large swell came unexpect-
On dark, stormy nights, when the waves
roll high, it Is good to know that what
ever troubles come to vessels struggling
with the wild sea there are eight good
men and true willing and trained to the
duty of rescue. It is on such nights that
Captain Varney and his crew listen well
for the signal of distress, and when it
'comes the Golden Gate is always at hand,

At the end of the drill the boat cams

shore and the pallors, Jumping out, waded
through the waves. With their musical
chorus of "Heave, yo-oh; heave, yo-oh.*"
the trim craft was hoisted from the roll
ing surf and on the boat wagon, and the
good, stout horses of the service struggled
into a brave trot over the sand and up the)
hill to the life-saving station.
pigeon-win? maneuvers there was a mo
ment of uplifted oars, a sudden dropping;
of them and the sailors all slid over Into
one side of the boat. A moment later
there was a whir!, and the bottom of thÂ«
white craft appeared on the surface. thÂ»
sailors burled In "the water beneath her.
Then eight rubber hats popped out of tha
water, eight pairs of hands laid hold of
the Golden Gate and rolled her over, rtght
side upward. Clambering 1 Into the boat,
the drill was resumed. This was the part
of the practice, known as ''rolling" the.
boat. In pood and bad weather. In smooth
seas and rough.ones, the drill goes on. thÂ«
life-saving crew always in readiness* for
the call of humanity and In perfect train
ing to cope with the anger and treachery
of the sea. The life-saving crew are ex
pert swimmers, and "rolling" the boat
serves to keep them in regular practice.
At each weekly drill the boat Is "rolled"
two or three times, and to the eight sall
ors*of the crew It Is but the sport of &
moment to throw over the craft, takÂ«
their ducking, lay hold of and right the
boat again and climb aboard.
Farther out the sea was smoother, the
sun shining brightly, and the rise and fall
of the oars kept -time with the motion of
the boat. A mile from the shore we cir
cled about, and at the captain's command
the Golden Gate. began a series. of maneu
versâthe cutting of pigeon wings, execu
tion of X military figures, etc. The oars
cut'; Into the water like broadswords, and
the steady pulls ' sent the white boat
shooting through, the water at any num
ber of knots per hour. At the order to
turn the boat switched about and darted
ahead with Incredible swiftness. The end

queried *â¢ the Irishman. . I preferred to

edly, and before the captain's order could
be executed the 'curling 1 mass of -water
came pouring over us with the sweep and
the force of a torrent. I had been stand

the full benefit of the Intruding wave. I

Â¦with a bit of the bear in him, for he
sometimes said "Or-r-r-umph," but the
other laughed, and was as 'cheery as a
chipmunk in a newly deserted camp.
"This is the spot, the only â¢possible,"
raid the cheerful Disturber.
"Gr-r-r-umph," answered the gruff Dis

"Why. certainly, Harris, It's actu-ally
fat. and with a dozen or two men here
with axes we'll knock thunder out of .this
brush, and have these infernal trees

"It'll hev to do." Eaid Harris with dis
content.
"You're as bad as the old Scotch grum
bler who said that the engine bed laid
cown by his son was 'level but nae

clrree. we'll have a lovely time building.
Gimme a railroad."
He troacked ruddy lips and gleamed red
in the westering sun.
'"Back to the Narrows, old man."
Next morning more invaders came in
many boats and old Indian dug-oute, and
there was the sound of axes laid to the
roots of ancient pines. Ephraim of the
woods heard nothing for he was far off
itmor.g the silent hills on a blueberry plc

"Look out now! Stand from under,

"How's she falling?"
The chief axman stood with his palm
against the bole of the biggest monarch
there.
*"Or.e more clip."
The tree whimpered and wavered, and
cracked loudly.
"This Â¦way. my beauty," said the axman
t.s he moved aside, still with his palm to
the bark. The tree bowed, and with an
ever increasing speed swept to the ground,
landing with an awful crash. So fell many
that hour.
They built a road.
They marked out a place for the C. P.

Sissons rose eariy, having never bean
to bed. All night long:' that street of 31a
sons was aflare with lights and men's
â¢yea and stars and. metaphorically, with
a. thousand headlights of engines. Strang
ers shook hands; strangers there were
,one; a Chinaman was a fellow creature;
tfisson himself gave a hand to any thrust
out fist of # congratulation. And Sisson
was somebody then ajid always. Sisson,
and Slssnn's -sibilated on every tongue.
They said:
"Slssons is' a town"â
"And will be"â
An inte.-Jected "nothing" produced up
roar till the Interjector humbly explained
that his "nothing" by no means referred
to Slsson's.
"What is she now?"
"And what will she be?"
â¢ They walked along the Christmas tres
forest of imagination and cracked nuts
with twenty dollar gold pieces in them. A
leaf was at least a dollar bill.
"Here's to the city of Slssons â the
mountain capital!"
They drank to that. The shack owner
passed a box of clears about and actually
forgot and cave the best.
And yet they knew that Slssons was a
coruscating symbol only: east was a ham
mer, west was anvil, and SIssotis flew out
in sparks. Harris, the devil's advocate of
black truth, said so. being melancholy
drunk, and he was ejected by tha virtu

"To-morrow â no â to-day."
The sun climbed ove* 1 the hillaâ and '.t

blacked or greased boots and many clean

How they cheered, stumbling amonjr

around, half aghast, to think it so near
done. The autumn of accomplishment
suddenly saddened them. ""Where shall

Sissons quivered and almost knew itself
a name.
-"I'm going to-morrow. or next dayâ but
you â you will rtay. of course, for tho
greater, sollder glory of Slssons."
Now. you .virtuous and you temperata
must understand how it was that Slssons
proceeded to raise Cain and get full, far
too full, of various Imported adultera

clad with illusion, and when the work was
over began to feel cold. For some it was
their last work; for some their first. Somn
faeed idleness, some faced seeking. An
ended job is a cold day always. Who
shall provide? Slssons couldn't say, and
therewith proceeded to get very much,
over the border of strict sobriety. Be it
remembered., without infinite regret, that
the great, the lesser and the little, and all
their satellites, were Just about as full a*

Commons. The three taken together are
in reality the sovereign of the British em
pire. .
On "the other hand, the King of England
has some curious powers, most of which
are practically obsqlete and feV of which
are ever. used.. So far as constitutional
rights are concerned the King may. If he
choose/ forbid any one of his subjects to
leave the empire. If any Englishman pro
poses to visit Paris or New York, for in
stance, the new King would be quite with
in the limits of his rights if he should
order him to stay at home. He might Is
sue a writ to that effect and the proper
authorities would see that it was enforced.
There is small probability, it may be said,
that thfs' provision will ever be. enforced.
Again, If a subject of the British King
Is absent in a foreign "land on business or
pleasure the King has the right to send
h'lm an order *to come home. If such an
order is not obeyed the King may confis
cate the property of the Â¦ rebellious* sub
ject so far as it is located in the British
isles. Another right which belongs to the
occupant of the English throne is that of
printing the Bible, the book *f common
prayer and the acts rf Parliament. This
right is exclusive and applies to all por
tions of the British empire, so that tile
King.might-if he chose -forbid the printing
of such books in' Canada or Australia. The
last time this right was exercised was a
short time before the revolution of the
American colonies, when the colonists
were compelled to get their supply from
the mother country. . .,-.-.,
Â¦mil the land In the kingdom is, accord
ing to law, held by the present tenants
"from the crown." Landowners regard,
it as their own. but in reality it belongs
to the King, and if the letter of the law
were strictly followed he might recall and
recover It in a perfectly legal manner. To
the King also belongs absolutely all tha
shore around the whole coast of the Isl
ands from low to high water marks. SomÂ»
day when an ingenious invento'r discovers
a method of taking advantage of the mo
tion of the tides this ownership may add
greatly to the present income of the
crown. The King Is also vested with the
ownership of the beds of all tidal rivers,
such as the Thames.
A curious limitation of the powers of a
King is the fact that his wife, though a
Queen, Is in the eyes of the law a mere
subject. It -would, it Is true, be high
treason to attempt to kill her. but if she
should commit any offense against the
laws of the country she might be brought
into court like any ordinary person, and
if convicted of an offense fined or even
imprisoned.
By a legal fiction the King of England
is supposed to be present In every court
In the land. An ordinary citizen who Is

If You Eeyy the
KTNG OF
ENGLAND
Here Are Some
Things That
THE KING
CANNOT DO
THE rulers of the peoples of the
earth, of whom there are how sev
enty-slx of recognized Importance,
have on the average* much less, pow
er than is usually imagined. The new-
King of England,' in many .ways, is not as
free as. his subjects^
An ordinary Englishman may travel
where he pleases and may select his own
traveling companions. The If Ing of Eng
land may not leave the confines of the
empire without being accompanied by a
Minister of State. The British constitu
tion provides that the" King shall hold
himself at all. times in readiness, to sign
acts In Parliament after they have passed
in both Houses of the national Legisla
ture. Until" they have been so signed they,
do not become-law. It might happen that
in some crisis. the KJng"s signature wouM
be needed without a moment's delay. The
existence of the state itself might well .
depend on instant action; for instance, an
army of invasion might suddenly appear
off the coast of. England, In which case
It would bo necessary to call out the mill- r
tla. This could not be done legally with
out the signature of the King. Therefore
it is provided that a responsible Minister
of State shall accompany the King wher
ever he may go to, present emergency acts"
of Parliament to him for signature. Evon
If Parliament is not in session, r this act
Is. enforced, because It might be necessary.,
at any time to call Parliament to "meet in
extraordinary session'. r '^i'WTj:r}%
No matter how tired the King of Eng
land might grow of his responsibilities the
lawyers say that . he could not abdicate.
There is no precedent for such an action,
and, as Is well known,- precedent is an im
portant factor In the British Government. .
If j the . King should absent himself from
the kingdom without formally Wtifying
his Ministers of State, so that one of them'
might accompany him. Parliament would
be obliged to meet' and declare the throne
vacant. According to the authorities the
crown would then be placed' in commis
sion; that Is, the IClhg's place would then,
be taken by a kind of Board of Director,
composed of the highest statesmen and
noblemen in the land.; What such a .com
mission would do with a royal 'truant on
his return does not seem clear. No; ruler.
of : England has ever, done such a thing,
and therefore there Is no historic prece
dent to serve as a guide for future action.
No King of England can force a subject
to accept a peerage or other, title of nobil
ity. There are few Englishmen, indeed,
who would refuse to be made Earls, if tbY

A good way to get around the matter

DR. J. A. BLACK CONSIDERS CERTAIN KINDS MORE BENEFICIAL
THAN HARMFUL
T? BELIEVE that the proper kind of
I veil is of more benefit than harm
" to the eyes. It protects them from
stinging wind and flying â¢ dust and
serves to moderate the glare of an in
tense sunlight. Even granting that
any obstruction between the eye and
the object of vision is a disadvantage,
still T believe that the benefit derived
from protection more than counter
balances this.
If the mesh of the veil is regular
the .eye becomes accustomed to look
ing past it, just as every day of its
life it looks past the effete blood ves-
sels that lie within it. It is so used
to these that it feels no distress from
them. So it can be with the reguttr
threads of a veil. Your eyes would
not be seriously injured by looking
through a screen window. The prin
ciple is the same with the proper sort
of veiling. . i : . " 3
With an irregular mesh the matter
is different. In this case the eye has
no sooner learned to ignore the lines
of one formation than it glances up.

formation. Or, worst of all, it comes

The Ideal veil, then, is thick

regular. I don't care whether the>

Its color is blue or green.
The bad veil is white or red, of a

SIGHTBY MARGARET E. SANGSTER.
IF I had a daughter In the tweet bloom
of her years, when. a husband might
loom up on the- horizon, far would It
be from me to choose for her In a mat
ter of such personal importance. Yet X
might 'give advice,' and I hope It would da
It " tactfully, * for much pre-matrlmonial
counsel defeats Its own ends, confirms
hesitation, and absolutely sends girls and
men . the opposite way from which the
counsel warned them.
Only on a solid foundation of true lova
and real respect can she or can he hope tu
build an. edifice . that will last. They
must choose for themselves.
I would like to nee my daughter marry
a man whose mother had early trained
him In unselfishness at home. I would
prefer a man who had as a Boy lived with
sisters, two older and three younger per
haps, and waited on them. all. and who
had been -their escort, companion and
friend.
POLITE, PATIENT,
CONSIDERATE AND LOVING
the man who will be food to his wife in
sunshine and shade, in youth and age, H
the one likeliest to make her happy.
She would demand good habtta In the
one who vowed to "comfort" and protect
her daughter, lest the protector should
change into a danger, the comforter into a
disgrace. She would l:ke to hava him :*
man who would, sometimes give a kindly
thought to the woman who tolled early
and late to make the sweet wife he loves
and admires what sho Is. And. who pa
tiently Btepped down and out of the heart
and life where she had relaned supreme,
leaving, him ffrst and dearest. And she
would greatly prefer that he should re
frain from, making the mother-in-law
joke. But if she be a. sensible woman sha
will not insist upon this, but quietly efface
herself aa much as possible, remembering
that this has been the mother's Jot siheo
first the son* of God .looked upon tlÂ»e
daughters of . men and saw that they
were, exceedingly arid 'vonderfully fair.
And If she can bring herself, to lovo
the intruder, as so* many have, and re
ceive a loyal affection in return, why so
much thÂ« better: the Inevitable then be*
comes endurable! He uhould have cour
age, for there t will be many, lions to pas?
on the .wedded journey and ho will : o'e
purpose In evidence, brings the two to
gether,Â«conscious that propinquity is as
potent as any other factor. Every mother
has not only a right but a duty in rela
tion to a child's marriage. You often
hear a man of very moderate desert say
that he requires in a wife virtue, birth,
breeding, beauty, good, nature, education,
money and other superlative gifts; so
why shall a mother be less demanding In
behalf of. her daughter? it will then go
without saying that this husband of a
sweet and Innocent and carefully reared
girl shall be -a satisfactory specimen of
the race, manly, brave and good to look
upon.j That means that he will have good
health: and having good health he. will
have food nature, and good nature Is very
Â¦necessary to household happiness. If he
loves his neighbor as himself he_ meets
the chief requirement for the happiness
of wife and family; for then he Is un
â¢elflsh. The unselfish man is a natural
Christian. Thus, on the whole, unselfish
ness Is the first positive quality that I
should require. For with unselfishness
there will be that generosity which not
only gives with an open hand but which
so regards the feelings and wishes of oth
ers as to make 111 temper and dark moods
impossible. With unselfishness there will
be self-restraint and sobriety arid honesty
and fidelity. With unselfishness, again,
will be purityâ the safeguard of home. In
addition to this unselfishness, which is at
the root 57 most If not all of the virtues.
I should like Intellect in this supposititious
husband â¢ of a daughter. I would like,
moreover", that he should have educatlpn.
But there Is an education of circum
stances which surpasses' that of books,
that makes mere knowledge of disputable
facts and technicalities ,se<;m email and

SHOULD RESPECT
HIS WIFE'S MOTHER
BY REV. DR. THOMAS 6PURQEON.
WHAT can I say on such a theme?
Why, bless his dear little heart,
he is only eight years of age.
and it seems at present almost
impossible to contemplate matrimony for
him.
What will my dear boy's disposition
ripen Into? What will be his calling In
life? These and other questions must be
answered ere I can discuss this matter to
any purpose whatsoever.
Should he become, in answer to many
hopes, a minister of the gospel, he will
need ouch a one for partner as might not
have been essential to him in another vo
cation. In any case, the matter is best In
God's hands. "The wife I should choose
for my son" Is the one he selects. Such
ought to be for the best, for "A prudent
wife la from the Lord."
MUCH DEPENDS UPON DIS
POSITION AND OCCUPATION
BY COUNTESS SCHIM.MELMANN.
WHAT kind of a husband shall I
choose for my daughter? I would
advise that both mother and
daughter put this matter Into- the
hands of God and let him choose for you;
then and only then will your daughter's
happiness be secured. If we carefully
study our Bible we will see that In the
beginning of humanity God very posi
tively and specially took the marriages
into his own hand. I believe that It has*
assuredly be*n God's will all along, that
no marriages should be formed except
by such apeclnl orders from God. Our
own choosing at the very best Is short
ilghted and limited and we cannot over
.some two difficulties; the one Is that a
human being, and especially a man who
goes out wooing, can disguise his char
acter; and the second Is,' that characters
actually do change under the lnfiue'nce ot
circumstances. You might, for example,
choose a quiet, soft-minded husband for
your daughter, and ten years later, after
a â¢wearying, troublesome life, find that ha
possessed an Irritable nature; or in the
character of an energetic, active young
man good luck and the accumulation or
.wealth may destroy these qualities, and
he turns out an apathetic, lazy and whol
ly good-for-nothing fellow.
Now if a mother Is perfectly sure that
""lit the case of her daughter It 13 God's will
that she should be married, she has not
only the right, but it Is her duty so far
to care for the things of this world as
to prevent her daughter from getting the
wrong husband. The mother's duty should
be rather limited to prevent wrong, than
extended to choose for her daughter.
How arÂ© we then to behave? First, live
near io God and bring your daughter near
to him; be led by him very specially In
this matter. - If you feel that she should
marry, do not think of any but a Chris
tian husband. Yet not he that speaks
best of Christianity, neither he who
knows most of It.* nor he that does most
of It. will give you* fla good a guaranty of;
happiness for your daughter as the one
whose character and daily life are wit
nesses of his Christianity.
Ona of the strangest accidents which,

tleship recently alarmed thÂ» gunners in'

by electricity only a portion of thÂ© pro
jectile was discharged, the base plate of
the. shot and a portion of the frame bein?
left In the gun. When the plate was re
moved thÂ© pressure of gas forced a por
tion of the projectile from the breech oC
tho gun. On the second gun being fired a
hole about three Inches in diameter was
blown -through the projectile, thÂ© other^
part of the ban* plate being left behind.
The baie plate was !n this case separated
from the rest of the projectile. Such ac
cidents are believed never previously to
have occurred on board any ship. Thero

as can bo seen both guns are sound.

society. He has a good thinking Jbrain, a
fairly eusceptlblc heart, and In time will
have experience enough to enable him to
launch and rail his own ship- Oh. how
full the world is of charming women!
Where can you find faith, virtue, honor,
self-denial. Intelligence, Industry, frugal-*
lty and abiding affection? These- qualities
are never more apparent and more prc

A QUEEN OF SILENCE
AND QUEEN OF SPEECH
BY BISHOP JOHN* H. VINCENT.

Woman answering io my ideal, these
are the words I should write:
. A woman of Intelligence, that he. at hla
wisest and best, might respect her; gain
ing In "culture and power with the passing
years. 1 hat he might no! outgrow her; in
dependent, that she might maintain her
rights: self-controlled, that she might not'
be easily overruled; vivacious, that she
might continue ' to Liter eat and insplro
him; gracious and agreeable In "social
manners, that she might help to make
thMr homo attractive to people cf taste
and refinement; having a specialty In art
or literature, that she might continually
augment her resources, expert as a cwk
useful expenditure and philanthropic oe
stowment, x training alike to discrimina
tion, prudence and generosity.
A woman devoted to the church, rever
encing and making delightful (if in a dif
ferent way from other days) the holy
Sabbath, recognizing the pre-eminence of
the Holy Bible over all other books, and
building up into our civilization as far as
her home can do it the noble Christian
elements which are the glory of the age
and the Government in which we live.
A woman free from affectations of every
sort, scorning to appear what she is not,,
accounting bluntness as rudeness, and yet
preferring' bluntness to pretense.
A woman who ia a Queen of Silence anfl
a Queen of Speech; holding tho golden
iscepter which lifted ensures the first, and
dropping gives the blessing of the second;
loving her home better than all other
places on earth, making it a foretaste of
the home eternal and sharing with other
earthly homes tho qualities of grace and
peace which make her own so delightful,
A , woman beautiful .with the personal
charms which reality In character be
stows: charms which make irregular fea
tures and a plain face attractive, and
which thought,; love and unselfish devo
tion make radiant. Such is my ideal of
tho wife I should seek for my son, if my
son were not. already thoroughly satisfied,

such a woman as I married my-
self:. It might be, however, that
my eon would not closely resemble my
self and in that case, I should insist that
his preferences ought to be different from
hla father's. But the supreme rule for
marriage is to make.' the basis of It only
a supreme affection. This should be
tested not only by love at first sight, but
perhaps by yearn of acquaintance, many
aided, thorough and of cumulative effect

BY WILL R. MOODY.
THE phraseology in which we apeak
of a person "falling in love" is sig
nificant of the abruptness with
'. which a young person discovers an
attachment for another. For' this very
reason It usual'y happens that some sel
dom seek the counsel of a father In sucn
matters before their choice has been al
ready made. So it has been for genera
tions, and the question you raise Is there
fore one that v.-onld. In actual- experience,
be almost unique.
And yet then? is probably no decision In
a man's life, next to his relations to God.
that is so important as tho choice Of a
wife. To make a wise choice is to find
reinforcement for all thht needs strength;
to make a mistake; In all but most excep
tional cases, means fiisaster to the best
possibilities of life's career. Many men
Â£ave been made by a wise choice, and,
'ftlos! many others hnve been ruined.
There are. however, certain principles,
easily discerned, which arÂ» essential to a
happy marriage. The first of these Is
loveJ Not the sentimental caprice of the
season, but that experience that once
known can never be confused with any
counterfeit. Surh a Iovp that grows day
by day and is strengthened more: in life's
tragedies than its joys. ' Second. It Is
essential to an ideal companionship that
there should be community of interests,
not simply in the worttTfl pleasures and
knowledge, but In the joys and Interests
of the kingdom of God.
Should a son o*f mine then ask my coun
sel on such a question, I would Impress
upon him these two essentials to a wise
choice. I would urge him to seek for the
companionship of one who would insplro
him to his best achievements, sympathize
with his highest aspirations, rejoice in
the things he loved; and last, and most
important of all. one who could enter Into
the fellowship of his sorrows, for in the
school of affliction as nowhere else souls
are drawn most closely together In love
and confidence.

He must a'so ha /c tastes that are. tc
a certain extent, congenial to those of her
whom he would make his wife. There
must be a harmony of interest that will
create a true marriage of minds as well a.
of hearts. She. to whom books are an
essential to happiness and to whom grea:
literature W an everrdelishtful field
through which she has always wandered,
and in which she nopes to roam at will
all her day*, will :ir;d herself sadly en
nuied by a life-cmpanion whose only
literature is his daily newspaper, and who
is conscious of no difference between the
children of Thackeray's brain and the
hysterical creation., ot the author of the
latest and most lurid of dime, novels.
There are few more pitiable objects than
an Intellectual woman linked for life to a
man who cannot appreciate her aspira
tions, and to wh<Â«m the talk of books and
matters literary is as an unknown- t*ngue.
A very important requisite in the hus
band that our girl would marry Is his
anility to support her In comfort. Per
haps fh* may not nave all the luxuries to
Â¦which she was accustomed in her father's
house, but no man has a moral right to
take a tenderly reared girl from a draw

A CHRISTIAN EVERY

I*Â«ft. but by Do mÂ«-ans least, our daugh
ter's husband must have the same re
ligious faith as herself. I do not mean
l>y this that he and the must, of neces
sity, belong to tht t-ume religious denom
ination, but that they must both belong
to the great Ctrardb universal, that their
hope tor this world and for that which is
to come must be. the same. This is the
great essential to tht true happiness our
daughter would gain. When the storms
of life dash upon her and her beloved, she
must feel that of a turety they are both
upheld by the Everlasting Arms.

The day following. 5 might not feel the

when I reflect that my son and his wife

which can see the humorous aspect even

It with a deeper nadneÂ«s. so tragrical as
to be utterly without relief, and without

The Kind of Wife
The Kind of HusbandHere Is the great Bernhardt born In 1844
âthat makes her flfti'-seven years old,
come the 22d of October next. Only last
season she produced the same author's
new tragedy and set the Seine afire with
her playing of it. More than that, tha
world feminine is wrapping Itself m
L'Aiglon cloak. It is corseting itself to
L'Aiglon. figure. It is shingling itself to
L'Aiglon hair-cut. The gods c^n grant no.
more. * - / '
Henry Fouquier wrote a sad good-by to
her when. she left France .or her Ameri
can tour, by which we are the" richer. His
parting tribute to her was . renchy In
Its eloquence, universal In its adoration.
Said 'he: "We may say. Indeed, that al!
forms of human realjtv or dream have is
sued from her lips or been evoked In her
attitudes." â¢ â¢ - â¢ -
Everybody knows by this time how In
this tragedy she plays the part of a^boyâ
the sad little Duke / of Reiehstadt:* She
plays it with a strength which. If the orig
inal Duke had possessed It. a critic says,
might have won for him greater things
than did his frail little hopes In real life.'
Whether- true to the life or not. at any]
rate it- Is a great tragic creation that
marks a new epoch in the career of Its
actress.
To Coquelln in the part of Cyrano no
greater tribute can be paid than, that of
Its author. The printed French edition of
the play contains on its first page the fol
lowing dedication: "It Is to. Cyrano's
spirit that I wished to dedicate this poem.
But' since that' spirit has passed into you.
Coquelin, it is to you that I Inscribe this
dedication. E. R."
Adolph Aderer gives an account of the
triumph of the piece In Paris. He says:
the more greedy for Coquelin's rendering.
When he brought it to America.'we were
eo dazzled by it that we forgot poor Mans-
Jleld, who had helped pave the way for
his part's creator. "Coqueiln and Rostand
together have given- us something new in
art," we have said.
And Coquelin is sixty sears old.
. " 'Cyrano* was played during the whols
of the year 1SSS. which we may well call
"Cyrano's* year. The hundredth perform
ance was given on March 5, which was a
veritable fete day. After the first act
flower-girls carried baskets full of littl*
bouquets in all parts of the theater, and
every spectator was able to select his fa
vorite flower. '
"Between the second and third acts
Ragueneau's little pastry cooks passed
around platters loaded with cakes. At the
one hundred and fourth- performance the
Porte-Salnt-Martin Theater had received
a round million of francs, or $200,000. The
piece was not played during the summer,
but was revived in September and contin
ued its triumphal course until the end of
the year, when the total receipts since the
first performance amounted to $500,000."
Earcey has written: "Coquelln is admir
able, and I cannot too often repeat It. He
is the soul of the piece. What a marvel
ous comedian; always on the stags and
warming all those around him by his lif#
and spirit."
The wonderful actors must share hon
ors with their playwright. Edmond Ros
tand, dramatic poet, came Into his fame
as a fln de siecle writer, and the new cen
tury hopes to see the development 6f his
powers.
Born only thirty-three years ago, he has
already been welcomed as the introducer
of a new epoch in his art. "What luck,
tv hat luck," criea a writer. "We aro at
last to be rid of the Scandinavian fogs, of
the too minute psychological studies and
the express brutalities of the realistic
drama. - We perceive the Joyous sun of
ancient Gaul, wblch, after* a long eclipse,
rises once more upon the horizon." i't't-' .
Think of that from Sarcey in the year
â¢1S97. when the new playwright was still In
his twenties!
It was three years before that, in 1SS4,
that the Comedic Francaise produced his
*'Romaa.es.ques." Its success was so great
.that Bernhardt^immediately ordered him,
to write' her a play. T*he outcome of their
arrangement was "Princess I^ointaflie,"
and the moderate success of this was fol
lowed by a greater one in "Samaritaine."
Rostand's first great triumph was still to
come, however, and it was Coquelln, In
stead of his good angel Eernhardt, who
was to ftelp him achieve i*. "Cyrano" pro
nounced him the new dramatist. v
If fate seemed a bit unfair in this, she
squared herself last season by letting him
produce "L'Aiglon" for the divine Sarah's
portrayal. It proved as tremendous a trag
edy as "Cyrano" had been comedy, and
its popularity was aa far-reaching. Here
again on this side the water has a Ros
tand play been taken up and attempted
by an ambitious actor.
The public is loyal to Maude Adams and
to Richard Mansfield, but there's no use
talking; art is. art, and it couldn't tell
what these two plays really were until
Bernhart and Coquelln showed It.

and' each died In his young manhood, be

cannot affirmatively, find that their deata
was caused by their treatment." '
Taking: up the Booz case, the committed
states that. his conduct at the academy
was strictly correct, although under tha
offensive class despotism It was viewed
as meriting chastisement. Tha circum
stances, of his being called out. his flgfit
and . the system t of annoyance, practiced
on" him- are "minutely stated. Tho com
'mlttee add:." : Â¦
"Whether injuries in the fight, disturb

have studied and grained in strength and
vigor, are also problems beyond human
knowledge to determine. And tho Ilka
commentary must be made respectln j tha
case of John Edward Breth."
The committee say on tho whole a
man's religious opinions are highly re
spected at the academy. In one case a
cadet was called a "damned Jew." but
this was an Isolated case. Two Hebrews
now at the academy testified that they
have never been ill-treated on account of

maintaining discipline In a reservation oC

. Continuing tha report says:
"As this system grew, and became more
and more oppressive it became necessary
to have some effective means to coerce
obedience to these unlawful behests of
upper class men and to meet this demand
a system of fighting has gradually grown
.up. which Is shocking in' its character.
Each.of the ,upper classes has a regular
fighting committee, and .' whenever it is
reported, for example, to the president ,of
the' third class thut some '-Â¦ fourth' class
man has refused to obey, any of tha un
lawful and illegal orders of an upper
class man or has in some other Important
respect violated' tho upper class code, all
of which it must be borne- In mind is In
direct conflict' with the 'regulations and
rules of the academy,, the president calls
his'flghtirig committee together and if it
thinks the * charge -rude- it orders the
fourth, class man . called - out and names
the man who Is to whip him." '
Fighting Most Vicious, vl' â¢
The committee describe the fights at
length and say:
"A fight to a finish has more vicious
meaning here than elsewhere. Theoretic
ally, when a man la clearly whipped his
seconds may throw up the fight The rec
ord shows, however, but ' one Instance of
this being attempted and In that the prin
cipal was the upper class man In the fight
and refused to abide by his. seconds' ad
vice. To show his grit and courage the de
feated party, although helpless so far as
fighting Is concerned, must nominally go
on so long as there la any possibility that
he can come back to the ring, even though
he is incapable of doing -anything but
take punishment. Many of the witnesses
say that he must nght until knocked In

would be excused when physically incap

die with it. Such fights as these are felo

The report states that a system of fight

the committee states that tlje West Point

The report first 'discusses the class dis
tinctions between the upper class men' and
\he "beasts" and "plebes,'' as the new ar
rivals and unde,r class men are called, and
says: 1 '
'"The upper class men have gradually
evolved an entire code of unwritten laws
governing their relations with . fourth
class men as well as the whole course of
conduct which should be pursued by the
latter. Under this code no friendships are
formed between the upper class men and
the' lower class men; they have" no social
Intercourse or relations. Except where
the parties have been acquainted before
entering -the . academy, the upper class
man treats, the fourth "class man as'ua
knownr a. stranger and an inferior. ' The
fourth class~man has no right to speak so
cially to" the'upper class man, and when he
speaks to', him onTbuslness he addresses
him as 'mister* or, 'sir.' No fourth class
man should '. gaze, stare or even look
squarely at an upper class man, but drop

Apparent mutual reconciliations fol
lowed, but the infatuation between Harris
and Mrs. Binfcrd waj too deep to be
smothered. Harris onenly visited Mr3.
Binford on her return to Los Angeles, and
he declared to her oarents his desire to
marry her. When Blnford and the first
Mrs. Harris realized rhe- situation tjiey

the local social scandal of the year. Mrs.
Harris promptly filed suit for divorce, but
Binfcrd had the guilty pair arrested at
Phoenix. The â¢ charge was reduced to a
nominal basis, and the principals, plead
ing guilty, were lined $100 each.
By this time the enthusiasm had been
worked up to a high degree and Mrs. Na
tion was urged to make a tour of , the sa
loons'. This she agreed to do, and at 3:30
o'clock, accompanied by ; two city de
tectives detailed by the Chief of Police,
called upon four saloon-keepers in their
places of business. She was followed by
an enormous crowd,, reaching as* high as
5000. When the barroom of the KIrkwood
Hotel was reached the Chief of Police
held a hasty consultation with his offl
cers and conclude J to stop the crusade.
After half an hour's work on the part
of tbe police a way was made through
the crowd for Mrs. Nation to reach a car
riage which had been provided. Once in
side the carriage the clamor for a shako
of her hand was too great and the saloon
smasher stepped out of the carriage and
clinging to the swinging door with one
hand frantically grasped the outstretched
bands andT~arms with the other and
wrung them sincerely, crying all the
while: "God bless you; here's a saloon
smasher. God bless you." .,-'..Â¦
After the reception, which lasted fully
â¢fifteen minutes, the crowd was forced
back. and the carriage moved up to the
Sablne House, the only prominent hotel
In the city without a bar. Here Mrs. Na
tion received many hundreds, shaking
hands and giving: all -'her. blessings. '
At Des Molnes there were fully 5000 peo
ple cheering and yelling at the station
when the train pulled in. As Mrs. Nation
walked out of the car and got a glimpse
of the va3t throng she broke loose In
childish glee, saying: HT:
"Just look at It! Just look at the dears!
May God bless every one! 1 ' '
"You are one of the smashed!" cried
Mrs. Nation. "I guess I'll have to go
out there after you."
The crowd gave way, but Mrs. Nation
simply laughed and the man sulked.
"We've got a couple of Joints herÂ© t in
town," cried another man. . ' .
"Smash 'em! Smash "em!" cried. Mrs.
Nation.
The crowd roared, but the man simply
reddened in the face and refused to budge.
"There's a man .'that needs a saloon
smasher, all right: I can tell him by his
looks. Come up here, my friend, and
shake handa^with Car rio Nation; don't
be afraid." - . . C- V '
Large crowds were at Dexter and Earl
ham, while De Soto and Booneville turned
out well, considering the size of the towns.
Mis. Nation did not show any symptoms
of fatigue, but continued as effervescent
and Jubilant as ever. At Valley Junction
fully 200 laboring men were present, many
of them railroad hands employed in the
Reck Island's shops. ] There Mrs. Nation
shook hands with everybody within reach
and then singled' out a red-ncsed man as
the victim of her retort. Â¦Â¦

measures more surely calculated to help
morality.
"Turning to Kansas and speaking as a
Catholic and American, I am free to con
fi-Fs the disturbances which have occurred
there since the institution of the present
ami-liquor crusade have filled me Â¦with
pain, sorrow and astonishment. Either
the total abstinence laws of Kansas are
wise, just and necessary, or they are not.
If they are necessary and wise and Just,
they should be rigidly enforced by the
legislative authorities. If, on the other
hand, they are none of these things, they
should be legally and regularly repealed.
"I have never been able to convince my
self," 6ald the Cardinal, "that what we
call total abstinence Is essential to moral
ity. The moderate and occasional use of
alcoholic liquors is not to be condemned..
In countries like France and Italy, where
the people as a rule drink wine, no serious
harm results from the practice. Even in
Rome â even at the Vaticanâ wine is not
prohibited, and as we know the Papal

special capacity, probably as a Commis
sioner, which will enable him to treat with
the Boer generals.
His appointment will be a virtual super
ceding of Lord Kitchener, who, it is ex
pected, will soon be .relieved and become
commander Jn chief In India.
The scheme, which it is believed in the
best Informed circles is afoot for the end-
Ing of the war, undoubtedly is due to the
Influence of the King, who was actuated
by the advice of the Kaiser.
A comprehensive view pf the interna
tional conditions reveals only improved
prospects for continued peace and har
mony. From the British standpoint Queen
Victoria's death appears to have strength
ened rather than weakened Great Brit
ain's position among the nations. A suf
ficient time has elapsed since Victoria
ceased to reign for the foreign officers to
feel the political pulse of the capitals of
Europe, and the brief examination, com
menced in no spirit of eocksureness, re
sulted In a. feeling- of satisfaction and se
curity at Downing street. The foremost
factor in this, naturally, is Emperor Wil
liam's attitude. Responsible officials here
make no attempt to conceal their elation
at the circumstances attendant upon his
Majesy's visit. They do not shut their
eyes at the dissatisfaction the Emperor
has caused among certain sections of his
subjects, but rely Implicitly on the Impe
rious force of Germany's ruler to success
fully overcome the internal opposition en
gendered. Closer relations undoubtedly
now exist between Great Britain and Ger
many.
Lord Salisbury and Lord Lansdowne
are quite prepared to hear Count von Bu
low, the Imperial Chancellor, satirically
belittle the effect of Emperor "William's
visit, but in Downing street this will ' be
taken as meant purely for home consump
tion.
The alliance between Great Britain and
Portugal scarcely needed the visit or King
Charles to render it stronger. Yet the
continued stay here of "that ruler is- be
lieved to \>e likely to bring Portugal and
Great Britain In closer touch, thua render
ing easier the work of their respective
Governments. So far as the diplomatic:
phase goes, the Associated Press is offi
cially informed that nothing new has re
sulted from the King of Portugal's stay
in London. The mutual responsibilities In
connection with Delagoa Bay were too
well known previously to need further dis
cussion. Thus Portugal. Germany and
Great Britain are believed to be more
closely united than ever in their historyâ
united by -a compact that, In the opinion
of leading statesmen of Great Britain
is stronger than ever was the Dreibund '
The only feature of the recent interna
tional happenings regretted at Downing
street is the Lmperor's decoration of
Field Marshal Lord Roberts with the Or
der of the Black Eagle. It is thought his
Majesty went almost too far. in view of
the hostile comments the German prexs
is In the habit of printing on Great Bri
tain's South African campaign. Still, say
the officials. Emperor William never doe*
things by halves.
Neither in China, nor in other parts of
the world, do Russia and France. In the
Foreign Office's views, give any indication
of counteraction against this activity: of
British diplomacy. Lord Salisbury is said
to rely on Emperor William to keep in
touch with the Czar. So long aa this is
feasible France is not expected to ta'te
any serious initiative.
_ Moreover, according to dispatches In the
British press. French Anglophobiaism
seems to have abated since the Queen's
death.
Austria and Italy are put down aa sure
to do nothing contrary to Emperor Wil
liam's wish. It is easily seen that Em
peror William is the dominating figure in
European affairs. To this Great Britain
has. no objection. She has made it possi
ble and trusts to benefit by it. Relations
between the reigning families of EuroDe
is not held to be much account among the
Chancellories, but so far as it goes, It'lj
believed that King Edward VII's person
ality will tend to improve its degree of
â¢potency. . .

BERLIN*. Feb. 9.â The Anglo-German
relations and their surmised modi
fications, owing to Emperor Wil
liam's visit to England, form just
now the all-engrossing topic. Since
his Majesty's return all Germany
has been enpaped in the discussion. The
decorating' of I_ord Roberts with the or
.der of the Black Kagle. and Emperor Wil
liam's reply to King Edward's speech. In
which the Emperor said he was honored
In wearing a British uniform, and that
the Emperor's army would likewise feel
it an honor, have especially aroused keen
crltfclsm, which is privately expressed
much more freely than in print. In high
official circles the decorating of Lord Rob
erts with the Order of the Black Eagle,
which the officials do not confirm, is re
garded as being merely of personal sig
nificance and as expressing Emperor Wil
liam's appreciation of Lord Roberts as a
man and -a soldier. It Is not looked upon
as a political act and leaves Anglo-Ger
man relations precisely where they were
before the Incident. Nevertheless It Is
admitted that the act expresses the Em
peror's wish to end the bitterness in the
relations of the two countries, which does
not benefit Germany nor Great Britain.
The Kreuz Zeltung's comment yesterday
evening Is to-day making the rounds of
the I German press. Many Conservative
and Agrarian papers merely reproduce it
without comment. The Kreuz Zeitung ;
said:
"We fall to see why this Boer destroyer
(Roberts) should receive such a mark 'of
Emperor William's distinction, and also
why the Emperor, after being horribly In
sulted five years ago by the olflcers of hl8
brother regiment, should now show them
marked attentions."
Even the bitterly angrlophobe Deutsche
Tagres Zeitung, the leading Agrarian or
gan, in spite of the fact that the Agra
rians less than ever want the Emperor to
feel wroth with them, when they are pre
paring to defeat the canal bill a second
time and simultaneously demand prohib
itive cereal duties for their benefit, saya
It cannot doubt the Emperor's behavior
In England, based on the idea of closer
Anglo-American friendship, is intensely
unpopular with the vast majority of the
nation.
Whatever comment is made, however,
is In cautious terms. The Berliner Xeueste
Xachrichten (Conservative) to-day re
prints the Kreuz Zeltung's remarks, say
ing there is difference between Emperor
William's personal acts and words in Eng
land and German policy. Regarding the
latter the paper says:
"England Is Incapacitated from alliances
of any sort' because she has been tremen
dously weakened by the South African
war. As a military power she la not
worthy of serious attention. England,
therefore, will not pursue an aggressive
policy under any circumstances. An en
tente between England and Russia In the
near future is more likely than not. espe
cially as Russia coquettes with the Eng
lish money market and Jp economicallj*
and militarily unable to enter Into a strug
gle with England. For a time, it is true,
Er.glish naval superiority remains, and
the way to the German colonies can be
blocked by English vessels. Therefore, on
the whole, it Is wisest for Germany to
leave the door open for an Anglo-German
understanding and in the meanwhile live
in neace with England.
"Emperor's William's personal acts in
England were due to his praiseworthy
sympathetic impulses, which are devoid
of political significance, but the Emperor
must not be astonished if the feeling on
the subject among the German people
finds a respectful expression."
The National Zeitung (Nat)ohal Libert.!)
calls the Kreuz Zeitung*s article an amaz
ing utterance, and claims to doubt the re
port of the decoration of Lord Roberts
with the Order of the Black Eagle.
The^Voerwaerts, the leading Socialist
organ, ridicules Count von Bulow, whose
policy, the paper maintains, was thwarted
by the Emperor, and pretends to believe
Count von Bulow has gone to Homburg
to offer his resignation, reminding Von
Bulow that he recently announced in the
Reichstag that he would pursue his own
policy. The Voerwaerts ridicules the Con
servatlve press, which, it says, "is torn
by conflicting emotions."
The Berliner Tageblatt (Liberal) prints
special London correspondence In which
the writer Bays the German people will do
well to bury their animosity to Great
Britain when the British people extend
the hand 'Of friendship, adding that Great
Britain doubtless will be ready to pursue
a friendly course and support the drel
bund on occasion, unless the German peo
ple are insulting In their animosity The
writer concludes:
"The German people seem about to re
ject the friendship of tho great nation
which formerly Germany earnestly
wooed."
1>1Â© Taegllsche Rundschau (Conservative)
says the Emperor is estranged from the
nation by his behavior In England, and
declares a too close rapprochement with
Great Britain is opposed to German In
terests.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung. the ieadinir
Centrist organ, weighs the chances of a
Russian or British rapprochement for
Germany carefully, concluding that the
best policy for German Interests is an en
tente with Great Britain, from the Cath
olic standpoint particularly, and also be
cause an understanding with Great Brit
ain means the furtherance of more liberal
political institutions.
The Prussian Diet's action in referring
the canal bill to a committee of twenty
eight, composed -largely of opponents of
the measure, augurs 111 for the bill's
chances. The whole Conservative press
continues its warfare against the meas-

NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â Orris Benson, a
bright boy of 17,~dea_"arid"dumb and blind
from Infancy, never heard the sound of a
human \ voice nor the strains of music un
til last Thursday afternoon.
In thepresence of several of New York's
most .distinguished aurlsts Orris Benson
clamped to his head a. little device like an
attendant wears in a' telephone exchange,
and in less than ten minutes a new world
had opened, to the boy. , For the first time
since babyhood he was hearing andJactu
ally repeating, audibly a fujr his Instructor
such simple words as "mamma," "papa,"
"hello," "horse"- and "house." Orris Ben
son, at the age when most boys go to col
lege, was learning to lispthe language O
the nursery. By a short electrical wire the
headpiece was connected with a phono
graph arid into the brain cells, where mu
sic Had been known only as a name.' rolled
the martial strains of _>ousa"s "Stars and
Stripes Forever." ,
The boy .started in his' chair as if
shocked by a galvanic battery. His Fiijht
less eyes moved in the sockets pathetical
ly like those of a wondering- child. His
hands, long accustomed to do the work
of the eyes and ears alike, instinctively
clutched at the clamped headpiece as if to
solve the mystery of this new and strange
sensation, ' . ,
For an Instant an expression almost of
pain passed over his features, then with
a look of strained intensity, the lad set
tled back In his chair and for the first
time In his life listened. His nimble fin
gers sought those of his instructor and in
the sign language of touch* he said, "Yes,
I can hear it; but what is It?"
"It Is musicâ a military march."
"There are said to be not less than 6,
000,000 of human beings living who are
deaf mutes. The electrical device tested
with such remarkable results is one which

THE BEST TEST
Xb thB Service and Experience : of
Years.
The best soldier Is not the new recruit
of a few months' service.
TnÂ« best mechanic is not the appren-
tice, and the best man In tho line is he
who has been tried by years of service
and experience.
This is not only true of men but of
nearly everything- else, and especially is
It true of medicines for disease. New
remedies must be thoroughly tested and
their merit established beycJfd question
before the Intelligent public will put faith
in them.
There are not many remedies which
hare stood the test of ten years and con-
tinued to increase In popularity each year
but this is true of the Pyramid Pile Cure
and it is the only pile cure that 1 has stood
this test, and among the many popular
medicines on the market it Is the only one
which can be said to have no competitor*
its Kale has steadily Increased from year
to year and this result has been not so
much because of judicious adve'rtising as
because it has been recommended by word
of mouth from one cured sufferer to an-
other.
Piles is supposed to be caused.in most
cases by a sedentary life and lack -of
exercise, but it generally comes without
any apparent excuse and often people
who live an active outdoor life are vic-
tims of the disease. A case in point is that
of James Creeden, a lumberman and
teameter In Northern Michigan. He says:
"I suffered for eight or nine years from
Jtchinj, and protruding: piles, sometimes so
severely that I could scarcely walk, then
I would pet better for a week or two. but
the trouble always returned. I could not
afford the expense of an operation and en-
dured the disease until I wan advised by
mother, who lived in Manlstee, to give
the Pyramid Pile Cure a trial. . '
"I had never heard of It, but when I went
to town I asked my druggist about It and
he told me he had sold it for years and
nÂ«ver had a complaint of its failure to
cure piles. . - - . .
"I bought a package and found not only
relief but a permanent euro after several
weeks' regular use.
"One of the best things about the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure I found to.be its conven-
ience: being in suppository form and used
a,t night, it did not Interfere with my daily
work and I* simple and painless." â¢
All drurpists in the United States and
Canada sell the Pyramid Pile Cure at 60
cents per package. J

tee on. Irrigation met to-day and passed
favorably j upon Melick's constitutional
amendment No. 22, which does away with
riparian rights and puts the water of all
streams under public control. The amend
ment Is as follows:
The water of all streams shall forever re
main subject to public control. Beneficial use
shall b* the basis, the measure and the limit
of all rights to water. The right to water for
Irrigation vests in the user and becomes ap
purtenant to the land irrigated. Water for
irrigation is hereby declared to be a natural

The amendment is submitted in the form
of a new section, known as "section 37,
article 14, of the constitution, of the State
of California." A similar law is said to
be working well in Colorado and Wyom
ing.
Nutt's Senate bill 1S1, providing a means
whereby irrigation districts may settle
with their creditors for less than 100 cents
on the dollar will be recommended by
the committee for passage.
Milice's bill to provide for the organi

MENTO, Feb. 9.â Early in the ses
eion a .meeting of Assemblymen
from the northern and central
counties of the State was called
by Assemblyman Duryea as a re
sult of the idea that something
should be done to offset the combinations
that were being made in the south. Noth
ing was done at the meeting beyond dis
cussing the situation, and when the con
ference adjourned it was the general im
pression that, having made their demon
stration and declared themselves, the
northern counties would be let alone. It
was understood that should another meet
ing become necessary the Democrats of
both houses and the Senators from the
northern districts would be asked to join.
â¢ That meeting is now being discussed,
and plans are being laid to have it called
long enough before the taking up of the
apportionment measures to have some ef
fect upon their consideration. The agita
tion has been aroused by the proposed
plan to take from Sacramento one of her
Assemblymen. The Sacramento delega
tion in the Assembly has not appeared
actively as yet in the calls for a meeting,
but it is ready to join as soon as the pro
ject takes shape. Grove Johnson has as
sured one of the Assemblymen from the
north that he would Join heart and soul
in any such movement, and it was pre
sumed at the time that he spoke for his
colleagues.
Should the combination be made accord

movement claim, they will have twenty

anyway, and possibly thirty. They be
lleve they can obtain the support of the
Alaraeda delegation, for the northern
counties have been in sympathy with the
efforts of Alameda to get an extra Assem
blyman, and. so far as apportionment is
concerned, their interests are very much
alike.
The Democrats have favored such a
combination, particularly those from the
counties farthest north, and many of them
have signified their willingness to stand
in with any such scheme. In the general
redistrictlng the only chance the Demo
crats can have is by some such scheme,
and eo their assistance and support are
â¢looked for.
There is more than the single Assem
blyman from Sacramento that is bother
ing the northern part of the State, for
there is a fear that Humboldt also will
lose a legislator. Much dissatisfaction is
shown over the plans to cut up the north
ern part of the Stale into Senatorial dis
tricts and the plans for Congressional
districts have not met general northern
approval.
It is pointed out by the northern legis
lators that in the matter of redistnet
ing all the cutting Is being done in the
north, where the rule that 1S.000 must be
the constituency of every Assemblyman,
is rigidly enforced, while San Benito with
6^, Kings with 9S71 and San Maleo with
12.000. get an Assemblyman apiece.
In the matter of Senatorial districts
there is more trouble brewing, and if the
present- agitation continues it is likely
that before another week has passed the
consolidation of the norther* counties in
both houses foreshadowed early in" the
session will have become an accomplished
fact.

ALAMEDA, Feb. 9.â Policeman George
MacRae of the Alameda police force shot
and killed Myron Brown last October, and
at the. same time shot and badly wounded
the horse 1 that Brown and several com
panions were driving. It is costing the
city a lot of money to defend MacRae on
the murder charge which has been made
against him, %ind now it will have to pay
$23 to the owner of the horse that MacRae
so badly wounded. Other complications
are likely to arise before the thing is set
tled.
MacRae's aim was bad the night he shot
Brbwn for resisting him. He fired two or
three shots, one accidentally striking
Brown. Another hit the horse in the
haunches, inflicting a serious wound. It
was a valuable animal, and the owner,
Thomas McKenzie of Oakland, did not
care to lose It. So he hired a veterinary
surgeon, who e.xtracted the bullet and
kept the horse under his care for several
weeks, until It got well, charging accord
ingly.

Trustees. McKenzle's claim against the
city for $23 damages for veterinary hire

imous vote of the members. None of them
could see exactly why the claim should be
made against the city. They thought Of

own pocket. It is understood that unless
the City Trustees pay the bill suit will
be brought.

WOUNDS A HORSE
IN KILLING MAN
PORT TOWNSEN'D, Feb. 9.â The reve
nue cutter Grant returned this morning
from one of the most dangerous and im
portant cruises ever undertaken by a ves
sel of that service in the Northwest. The
Grant has been engaged in searching for
some evidence of the fate of the British
6hip Andrada, which, after arriving off
the Columbia River and taking aboard a
pilot, w&s blown off shore and has .never
since been heard of. The cutter made
the entire circuit of Vancouver Island,
and during the voyage found evidence
that leave's no doubt of the loss of the
Andrada, a boat's signboard badly bat
tered and bearing her name having been
picked up early in the cruise at Carma
nah.
The fate of Andrada was revealed by
Indians and also by a trader at Clayoquat
Sound, who reported to Captain Tosier
that on January 24 a big ship was sighted
a few miles oft shore on her beam ends,
and that seas were breaking over her.
No sien of life was visible on the unfor
tunate vessel. A high surf was rolling on
the beach, which prevented the Indians
going out* but next day several canoes
put out and after twelve hours' search
no trace of the craft could be found.
From the description of the vessel given
by the Indians she is believed to Tiave
been the Andrada. The Grant cruised
clear around- Vancouver Island, calling
at all places where there was -a habita
tion. The entire beach was strewn with
wreckage, which was demolished so that
nothing In the way of identification could
be found. On January 22 a wreckage
came ashore on Table Island, off Kyo
quok Sound, which indicated tha^. a vessel
carrying a eeneral cargo had come to
grief. The wreckage consisted of canned
goods and lumber, but nothing was found
indicating the name of the vessel from
which the wreckage came.
The most remarkable discovery made by
the Grant was a three-masted schooner,
high and dry on the heath, three miles
â¢west of Clyoose village, on an Isolated In
dian habitation. Xo record of the strand
ing of the vessel or the fate of the crew Is
known.
Captain Tosler says the Indians 'claim
that the schooner had been on the beach
for some time. A heavy surf prevented
the Grant landing a boat to investigate
and ascertain the name of the craft.
The Indians also told of having: picked
up a ring buoy, marked "Ilala, Liverpool."
The Ilala sailed from London, on June 8,
for Vancouver, B. C.

If you are sick or "feel badly," begin talcing the famous new discovery. Dr.

Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease Is not

of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there is any doubt in your mind as to your condition, take from your urine on
rising about four ounces, place It In a glass or bottle and let It stand twenty-four
hours. If on examination it is milky or cloudy, if there is a brick-dust settling, or
If small particles float about in it. your kidneys are in need of immediate attention.

THE ROOT OF THE MATTER.
He Cured Himself of Serious Stomach
Trouble Down to First Principles.
- A man of large affairs In one of our
prominent Eastern cities by too close at-
tention to business, too little exercise and
too many club dinners, finally began to
j pay nature's tax, levied in the form of
1 chronic stomach trouble; the failure of
his digestion brought about a nervous Ir-
ritability, making it impossible to applj-
himself to his daily business and finally
deranging the kidneys and heart
In his own words he says: "I consulted
one physician after another and each one
seemed to understand my case, but all the
same they each failed to bring about the
return of my former digestion, appetite
and vigor. For two years I went from
pillar to post, from one sanitarium to an-
oÂ» .*. r. I gave up smoking, I quit coffee
a.l even renounced my daily glass or two
. t 'jrer, bgt without any marked lmprove-
i tnt.
"Friends had often advised me to try a
well known proprietary medicine. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, and I had often
perused the newpaper advertisements of
the remedy, but never took any stock in
advertised medicines nor could believe a
50-cent patent medicine would touch my
case.
"To make a long story short, I finally
bought a couple of packages at the nea.Â«
est drug store and took two or thi,.^
tablets after each meal and occasionally a
tablet between meals, when I felt any
feeling of nausea or discomfort.
"I was surprised at the end of the first
week to note a marked improvement in
my appetite and general health and be-
fore the two packages were gone I was
certain that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
were going to cure completely and they
did not disappoint me. I can eat and
sleep and enjoy my coffee and cigar and
no one would suppose I had ever known
the horrors of dyspepsia.
"Out of friendly curiosity I wrote to the
proprietors of the remedy asking for in-
formation as to what the tablets con-
tained and they replied that the principal
Ingredients were aseptic pepsin (Govern-
ment test), malt diastase and otHer
natural digestives, w..lch digest food re-
gardless of the condition of the stomach "
The root of the matter Is this, the diges-
tive elements contained in Stuart'3 Dys-
pepsia Tablets will digest the food, give
the overworked stomach a chance to re-
cuperate and the nerves and whole svstem
receive the nourishment which can only
come from food; stimulants and nerve
tonics never give real strength, they give
a fictitious strength, â¢ invariably followed
by reaction. Every drop of. blood, every
nerve and tissue Is manufactured from
our daily food, and if you can insure its
prompt action and complete digestion by
the regular use of so good and wholesome
a remedy as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
you will have no need of nerve tonics or
sanitariums.
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
have been in tne market only a few years,
yet probably, every, druggist In the United

KILLS A NEGRO
Man Persisted in Using Profanity to
Her After Sh^ Had Told Him

eOT.rMRTTS: G.i.. Feb. ,0.- Mr.-. John
Manners, the wife of a well-known citizen
of this county, killed a negro named John
Cincinnati last night for usinc profanity
toward hor after she *~aÂ«l tnld him to stop.
No arrests have bÂ«?en made.
tÂ«nff 1 h i Hp WBP dr * ss <?d in the con
ventional clerical garb of the episcopacy.
Â£i h h hi . gh cut - straight buttoned black
coat, showing a strip of white collar about
the neck. On his head he wore a round
crowned, straight brimmed felt hat. such
lv,iL S^^? monl i!f 1 sed Â°y members of the
Episcopal brotherhood The morning was
th,f ,5m Â» taSl and he sten P ed out with
the agility of a young athlete.
Barely a block from his home on the
northeast corner of Midland avenue and
JJeech street, stands tne handsome sub
urban home of H. R. Koome. The young
clergyman had reached the intersection of
the streets, directly in front of Mr.
Kor>me s dwelling, and was standing al-
EiÂ° St iÂ°7. th . e curbl * vhen a man who haU
been loitering on the opposite corner ad
vanced rapidly toward him. and a few
brief words passed between them Tho
man was Thomas Barker.
As th*re were no actual witnesses near
enough to hear the spoken words it is im
possible to say whether they conveyed a
menace or an interrogation. The next In
stant, before the clergyman had time to
Urn toward his antagonist, Mr. Barkor
drew from a pocket of his overcoat a re
volver and at a distance probably an
greater than seven feet fired point "blank
at the right sido of the rector's h<*ad The
clergyman instinctively threw up his right
hand in defense, but the bullet had taken
enect. and he tottered and slowly fell to
the snow-covered pavement, the bag
which ho had been carrying dropped to
the ground as the shot was fired, and in
another moment the blood which poured
from his wound was staining the polished
silver of the communion chalice.
Barker left ho room for doubt that he
was shooting to kill. Advancing a single
*tep toward his prostrate victim, he fired
throe more shots in rapid succession. Two
of them penetrated the clergyman's soft
felt hat, one piercing the crown in two
places at a point about two Inches above
the brim, a second drilling a clean round
hole through the rim itself and the third
appearently going wide of its mark.
Barker then coolly restored the revolver
to his pocket, boarded a passing trolley
car. rode a mile and a half to the Town
Hall and surrendered himself to the no-
Hco.
No breath of scandal had ever touched
any of the parties to the tragedy up to
the time of its occurrence, and so friendly
had been the relations between Barker
and the man he shot that a year ago he
presented the rector with a bicycle. In
jail a few hours after the shooting how
ever. Barker explained to friends why he
did it.
Up said that hp had become convinced
on the previous night that some mental
trouble which his wife had not yet shared
with him was weighing heavily upon he"
He had urged her to tell him if this were
true, and after many tears and protesta
tions she had told him that the illness
which she had suffered for nearly a year
was tho result of an attack made upon
her in her home by the Rev. Mr. Keller
about a year apo. when he was making a
clerical call. She further explained that
after she had repulsed the advances which
he had made toward hor. and which were
not consistent with h<3 clerical dlgnitv a
struggle had followed during which Mrs.
Barker had become unconscious.
Mrs. Barker still refuses to make anv
statement. *
Dr. Keller arose that Sunday morning to
prepare for the sacred work of the day;
He was under engagement to go to Fort
Lee. N. J., to attend a dedicatory service
at the Church of the Good Shepherd. He
had in his possession the chalices'and oth
er vessels used in the rite of the holy com
munion of the EpiscoDal Church. It was
his purpose to return these vessels to their
place in the sanctuary before keeping his
engagement at Fort .Lee. He therefore
collected them carefullv into a cloth ba-'
made for the purpose, and at rive minutes
to S o'clock left the house and started
along the east side of Beech street toward

REV. JOHN A. KELLER IS REPORTED
TO BE IN A CRITICAL CONDITION
CINCINNATI, Feb. 9.â The situation is
more complicated than ever to-night re
garding the contests here next Friday
night between Martin and Childs and Jef
fries and Ruhlin. 'Â¦ Â¦. Â¦ I
It was thought that arguments would
be completed to-night before Judge Hol
lister on' the application for. a permanent
injunction against the. proposed contest.
The attorneys, however, instated on bo
much time for arguments that another
day will be spent in hearing them and
the case, will not be finally submitted to
Judge Hollisteir until Monday evening. It
ia hardly -possible that Judge .Hollister
will then be ready to render his decision
on Tuesday morning, and 'if he renders it
on Wednesday or Thursday there will be
very little time for, the proposed appeal
to the higher courts. Meantime there are
all sorts of- rumors about other proceed
ings, including an .action against Madden
and Brady for perjury and â¢ especially
against the former. Uurlng the argu
ments this afternoon Judge feck insisted
that the proceedings should be in a crim
inal court rather tnan one of equity, and
asked why Brady, Madden, Cook and oth
ers, who were in the courtroom, were not
arrested if they were abetting a prize
fight and held the same as Jeffries and
Huhlin had been two weeks ago. Counsel
for Â¦ the injunction replied that such
might be the case further on. At any
rate, there is much talk about what may
be aone to prevent the light. ;â¢
While the defense denies, the jurisdic
tion of the Court of Equity to grant such
an , injunction, as is asked , for, they will'
proceed on appeals and ' possibly other-
Wise in case tne injunction is granted. It
Is reported that if the injunction -.is re
fused the plaintiffs will stop their pro
ceedings on account of the limitation of
time and leave the matter to the Gover
nor. Â¦
William A. Brady made a dramatic as
well as a strong witness to-day. He was
not kept on the stand as long as Madden
yesterday, but he- made much more of an
impression. Madden had testilled that
Jeffries and Ruhlin would spar with "love
taps" for points. Brady, said his man
would hit as hard as he could to retain
the championship, and he had no doubt
that Ruhlin would meet him equally vig
orously. Brady said any other kind of a
performance would be a fake and an im
position eti the public. Brady, however,
maintained, as did Madden, that there
had been no prizefights since the days of
Sullivan.
Brady testified to sitting beside Theo
dore Roosevelt at one of toe contests In
the Metropolitan Theater in New York.
Brady testified to reserving a box for
Roosevelt at another 1 contest, but Itoose
velt did not attend. Brady thought his
failure to attend was because the New
York papers had said .Â«o much about him
having a bcx reserved.
Judge. H:irmon asked Brady If he
thought a man who was not afraid of .1
lion was afraid of newspaper talk/ Brady
r<*i)llodjin the negative and paid a hign
tribute Â¦ to â¢' Roosevelt. Â¦.' Judge Hollistor
asked Bra.dy if, lie thought Vice President
Roosevelt was a cowtird. Attorneys for
the defendant, in chorus, responded that
the question was verv much uncalled for.
Judge Hollister then scored the attorneys
for the. defense and said that thp question
was .asked because tht court considered
that a man who favor? such contests and
kept away' from them "because of public
semimrtit Isa'.coward.' ];?rady replied that
he considered" Roosevcltl thÂ« bravest man
oil earth. ''Brady, proceeded to testify to
the high .'Standing, of business men and
othcrg' who were prison t on the' occasion
when he sat' near Roosevelt, and on the
occasion on which he had reserved a box
for him,, and stated' tliat- he expected the
same class' of people' here next Friday
night. Ho testified to reserving a section
in the hall for members of the Board of
Trade of Chicago, and- to orders for tick
ets from prominent tnf.n a.11 over the coun
try.
The most prominent Â¦ arrivals to-day
were Tom Sharkey and Spider Kelly.
Sharkey pays he .is here to challenge tlW
winner immediately after the fiKht. Ho
says 1ip has a. forfeit of $2500 posted with
Al Smith in New York to fight Jeffrie?.
Should Ruhlln win the clleck will so as
forfeit for a meeting with him. Sharkey
says he expects Jeffries to win. but that
Ruhlin will give him a *iard fight. Shar
key savs he has a promise from Jeffries
to be the noxt man ii. the event that thÂ«
champion \vln3. Â¦ . .

THE SAK' FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY; 10, â'. 1 901.
PITTSBURG. Pa., Feb. . 9.â The nve
story brick building at Twenty-third
street and the Allegheny Valley Ruilroad.
occupied by the Armstrong Brothers'
cork factory, was destroyed by fire to
day, together with the foundry and ma
chine shop of the Totten & Hag Iron and
Steel Company, on Twenty-fourth street,
adjoining the Armstrongs. The loss will
reach almost $750,000, with Insurance cov
ering the amount fully. The loss of the
.Armstrong Company is 1700 ,C00.
The conflagration was one of the most
spectacular seen In Pittsburg for a long
time. The flames from the main building
of the Armstrong factory, where the fire
originated, spread with astonishing rapid
ity and five alarms were sounded in quick
succession, calling all the engines in the
lower city to the are. Great excitement
prevailed because the employes of the
cork factory, numbering 1500, were all at
work and It was feared thai many of the
girls and boys , in the building would not
be able to escape. Fortunately the sev
eral fire escapes and firemen's ladders
proved ample means ior the safety of all.
In spite of the firemen's good work tho
flames jumped across the street and ate
their way into the Totten & Hog factory
and laid waste the foundry and machine
shops before they could be checked,
causing $50,000 damage to this plant.
The Armstrong cork factory was the
largest plant of the kind in the country
and the company has offices in moat of
the principal cities. All of the valuable
machinery was destroyed, but the books
and papers In the olfiee were saved.

Ther* are people who say that the

I imagine she's weak, or may fancy she's*
sick, but her imagination can't, add forty

I t>r<v>Â£ ol ' the curative power of " Favorite

of health which is recorded in face and
form, of strength which can be tested,
and weight which can be registered in

The general health of women is so
intimately connected with the local
health of the womanly organs that

for me," write- Mrs. Edwin II. Gardner, of
Hsechwoofi. Novlolk Co., Mass. (Box 70.) "You
know I wrole to you last summer. I read what
your medicine had done for other people, so
thought I would try it. and I found it was a
blessuiR to me and my family. I began in June '
and took six bottle's of your medicine, and three
vials of ' Pellets.' , I took your medicine a year
when I had a leu-pound girl. I had the easiest ,
time I ever had with any of my three children.
I have becrr.vcry well since I took your medi-
cine. I took three bottles of J Favorite Prescrip-'
tion.' three of ' Golden Medical Discovery.' and
three vialsof ' Pellets.' I had uo appetite and
'could not eat much without it distressing me
before I tool; vour * Favorite Prescription,' and I
;. only weighed 135 pounds. Now I weigh 175."

completed when It wu laid aside for the
day, all the committee amendments be
ing adopted, but as the measure was
about to be placed on its passage Butler
precipitated a discussion of Â¦ the i armor
plate question. In order - to enable sonic
others to epeak upon the matter the bill
was laid aside until Monday.-
Butler called attention to the paragraph
in the bill appropriating $4,000,000 to pav
for armor plate already contracted for.
If the bill had provided the entire - sum
necessary to pay for armor contracted for
it would carry for that purpose, he said,
$16,564,550. He declared the Senate was
precluded from considering the matter
now because Congress har authorized the
Secretary of the Navy to pay for armor
whatever the armor trust could hold him
up for. Mr. Butler declared that by the

WILL EENOMINATE
THE HEROES OF SANTIAGO
President Expected to Send List of
Officers for Promotion to the
Senate.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 9.â It Is expected
that the President will on Monday next
renomlnate all the officers connected with
the naval victory off Santiago July 3, 1833,
whose nominations for advanced rank
failed of action in the Senate many
months ago.
The new nominations will be identical
In character with those formerly sent to
the Senate, with this difference, that the
operation of the personnel law already
has advanced many of the officers whose
names were on the list, and consequently
the department is obliged to make some
recommendations to carry out the spirit
of the board's instructions. Rear Admiral
Sampson is advanced to rank after Rear
Admiral Howell, the senior officer in his
prade, and next below Admiral Dewey.
Rear Admiral Schley Is advanced to rank
next below Rear Admiral Sampson. Tho
order of advancement In the case of the
other officers Is practically the same aa In
the original nomination.
"WTJ DID NOT INTEND TO
CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT
Explains His letter Regarding: Ex
clusion of Chinese From
Philippines.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 9.-The Incident
growing out of Minister Wu'i crltlclf?m
or General Otis In his letter to the So
cletv of the Gcnesee probably is closed
satisfactorily. Minister Wu has dla
avowed to the State Department any In
tention of criticizing the Government of
the United States.
It Is understood that Mr. Wu believed
the exclusion of the Chinese from the
Philippines to have originated with Gen
eral Otis, and not with the .War Depart
ment or any other branch of the Gov
ernment, and In speaking of his (General
Otis) having til advised, it is understood
there was In Mr. \\ u's mind the Idea that
some local representations In the Philip
pines had operated upon his mind to In
duce him to exclude the Chinese.
Says Time Is Eipe for Congress to
Declare That the Natives Will
in Due Time Become
â¢ FreÂ« Citizens.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 9.â Consideration
of the diplomatic and consular appropria
tion bill in the House to-day developed
something of a sensation when Represen
tative Brown of Ohio, standing In the cen
ter of the Republican side of the cham
ber, made a speech strongly condemning
a colonial policy, and urging that Con
gress should at once give assurance to the
Filipinos that the purpose of the United
States was to give them Independence.
His announcement that he would advo
cate a resolution to this effect was loudly
applauded, particularly on the Democratic
side, and at the close of the speech many
of his Republican associates crowded
about him and congratulated him. Rep
resentatives Miers of Indiana and Dins
more of Arkansas also spoke on the Phil
ippines.
Representative Brown said:
".Â». colonial policy will be a radical de
parture from the course which our Gov
ernment has constantly adhered to in Its
splendid career of more than a hundred
years. A colonial policy will be main
tained at a cost â greater than any sum
of money can measureâof violating prin
ciples which we have cherished, as the
very life of free government- A' colonial
policy will require us to govern without
I the consent of the governed. A colonial
policy will destroy the high ideals which I
we have so proudly followed from our be
ginning as a nation.
"Congress has never yet announced to
the Filipinos what the national purpose
is with respect to them. If this body will
tell them nowâ tell them explicitly and
solemnlyâ that it is the fixed determina
tion of this nation to establish its author
ity in their country, and that when this
end shall be reached they shall have a
! chance to become in due time free citi
| zens of a free governmentâ If Congress
; will say this to them and say It now, we
' may confidently expect that their rude i
; weapons of warfare will fall from- their
i hands and they will sue for peace â peace
which they will know means more for
them than anything ever held out to them
! or to their fathers in any generation.
"This declaration would now be oppor
> tune. It would be at this time a wise act
j which the Government is strong enough i
t to perform without having its motives
! questioned by frlenÂ«l or foe. Even the
j most deluded Filipino could not misun
i derstand it. It would go to him, as he
! would know, and as all the world knows,
I in the day of his triumph and his defeat,
i This declaration by Congress would now
go to the Filipinos as a great nation's
I amnesty to them.
j "Why not proclaim this to the Inhab
itants of the Philippine Islands and why
not proclaim it now? It may be argued
that this Is what we intend to do. It may
be asserted tHtit as we are now going,
and without the pledge of accord from
us, the ultimate end of our occupation of
Filipino territory will be Filipino freedom
and Filipino government. But we have
not said thts to the Filipinos. "We have
carefully and studiously refused to say
this to them."
Mr. Brown also referred to the talk
favorable to holding Cuba and said:
"We hear It said now â It Is almost com
mon talkâ that It was a mistake for our
Government to give assurance of a pur
pose to leave Cuba, Men assert, without
any apparent sense of shame, that while
It was all well enough for us to go to
war for the sake of humanity and in hu
manity's name we should have left our
selves free to bring the Cuban people into
subjection to us and free to take their
Island into our keeping and hold it as our
property. Deep regret Is expressed be
cause of the fact that before the â¢ world
we pledged ourselves to the .people of
Cuba that we would not make conquest
of their Island, but that we would leave
It to them. The man who says we should
have resorted to thl.Â» double dealing In
April, 1S98, now very logically and very
naturally goes a step further and says
that we ought to violate the pledge we
then made, whether tshe wants to come to
us or not. What more miserable, more In
human, more unpatriotic course could be
advocated? It Is the climax of greed
without one spark of conscience. It is tho
acme of avarice, without a single redeem
ing feature. It Is the doctrine of a free
booter of the world. It is the code of a
pirate of all the seas."
The consideration of the diplomatic and
consular bill went over at 2 o'clock and
the rest of the day was given to eulogies
to the late Representatives Daly of New
Jersey and Wise of Virginia.

JAMES M. BARRIE, WHO FUR
NISHES THE PRESENT TEXT,
"HELPLESSNESS."
The- Chinese Minister at Washington declined the other day to attend a dinner given in
honor of General Otis. While this. may mean that the Chinese Minister is particular with whom
he dines^ it shows that General Otis is not.
The local enthusiast who killed himself the other day because of a family quarrel overnve
cents certainly was best qualified to place a correct value upon his own worth. "
The victory is for the present that of the railroads and the other forces that oppose the
canal. They had the aid of the yellow journals/ of the country in the fight, and doubtless some of
those .journals, will display the result as a triumph of their own.
It is to be borne in mind that none of these forces dares any longer to openly oppose the
enterprise. They are now fighting it by indirection. They have brought about a delay that gives
them a big advantage. Diplomatic negotiations are likely to last a long time, particularly since the
Senate has shown an intention to thwart the plans of the administration. Such is the situation
now, and instead of seeing work begun this year we are to have nothing but more talk.
REPORTS from Washington announce that the British Government will not reject the Nic
araguan canal treaty as amended by the Senate. Neither will it accept the treaty. The
British will merely offer counter proposals and ask for further negotiations. It goes with
out saying the request will have to be granted and the negotiations undertaken. The Senate will
soon adjourn. Nearly a year will pass before* it will be ready to resume consideration of the sub
ject; and so the hope of seeing the great enterprise begun this year is balked and baffled.
That such would be the outcome of the rejection of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty by the Sen
ate was foreseen at. the time it was under consideration. The advocates of speedy work on the
canal pointed out again and again that to defeat the treaty was virtually to postpone the under
taking. Senator Morgan, an opponent of the administration who had no partiality for the treaty,
nevertheless urged its adoption as the sole means of providing for early work on the canal. The
Call and other influential journals repeatedly directed attention to the same point. But all, was in
vain. The treaty was defeated and the work postponed. . >

UPON another page we publish this morning a statement of the arrangements made for
a course of reading under the general title of 'The Current Topics Club." All readers are
invited to give it careful attention. These papers arc to take the place of the "Home Cir
cle Studies" that in the past have been so much appreciated by a wide circle of students. The new
series will appeal to an even larger constituency. In fact there is no class of intelligent men and
women who will not find the series interesting as well as instructive. ,
It is to be noted the new series will be of current interest. The papers while referring to mat
ters of permanent importance will treat of them in such a way as to make the information perti
nent to events now occurring. Consequently the discussions carried on throughout the series will
serve to illustrate the news of the time and will contribute to a clear understanding of the world's
The plan of the club includes a wide variety of subjects. On Mondays the articles will
treat of "The Opportunity and the Man"; on Tuesdays the subject will be "Colonial Governments
of To-Day": oh Wednesdays there are to be articles on 'The Women's Club Movement â What
It is Doing"; Thursday's series will give instruction on "The Art of Living a Hundred Years";
the Friday papers will give an account of "American Life n Century Ago," and on Saturdays
there will be articles on "What fhe Government Does for the Peor/e."
Each series of the course is under the direction of an established authority on that line of
work, and each paper will be from a writer of eminence. All of the articles will be furnished
by practical men, and what they write will be the result of a large experience in a successful career.
The prospectus published on another page should be read in full. Do not overlook it. .

MR. BARRIE. an authority if
ever there was one on the psy
chology of woman, tells us that
when GrlzH tri*-d to discover
what possible charm Elspeth
could have for David, she decided after
long analysis that this charm consisted
larpely In helplessness.
If this be true, the woman of the fu
ture in proportion a* she grows less help
less will grow le.Â«:s charming. Is this a
consummation devoutly to be wished for?
And whether to be wished for or not, who
is it that has made the woman of to
day less helpless than the woman of yes
terday, and who if It that threatens to
make entirely Independent, though per
haps not utterly charming, the woman of
to-morrow? It Is Man (with a large M, if
you- please, Mr. Printer)â Tyrant Man.

is so making her like unto himself and,
unto the gods who know both good and
evil.

ucation had been "finished" at some pol
ishing school or some "female academy."
as they actually used to call Itâ the wo
man of yesterday was content to sit at
home or to indulge in that dull dissipa
tion known as society, until It pleased
some youthful Aha.-uerus to extend unto
her the scepter of his kingly favor. Hav
ing captured him, as Schopenhauer would
say, she took possession of her (tempor
ary) thrall, deputed her thinking to him.
and aa a thinking being herself ceased
to exist. Her "daily, occupations," as
I^ady Teazle puts It, "to Inspect the dairy,
make extracts from the family recipe
book and comb my Aunt Deborah's lap
dog." She had a dozen children and died
in a green old age, never having used any
but the central lobe of her brain and quite
unconscious of the fact that she possessed
also a prefrontal. a postfrontal, a parietal,
a temporal and an occipital lobe.
As a teacher It has been Impressed upon
me that the educated young woman of to
day does not propose to pass her life in
such manner as* the uneducated .woman
of yesterday passed hers. Education ha3
given the modern young woman a desire
to be independent, to live her life her own
way, to walk In the paths of her own
choosing, and not perforce to tread the
prlmroFe path of dalliance that leads unto
the matrimonial altar. The great major

earn a living lake to teaching a3 one of
the few professions that give them a
chance of earning a return In any way
proportional to the capital they have in
vested in their education, while some, who
may be gifted with beauty or peculiar
talent or that desire for fame which Is
the last Infirmity of noble mindsâ some
look to the stage as the only profession
In which a woman can earn a wage com
mensurate with what Is paid to a man for
similar service.
From such I not seldom receive in
quiries as to the desirability of theatrical
life, the way to begin and the possibilities
of success. A few general remarks may
be not useless to them, and to many oth
ers who have longed to climb the ladder of
histrionic fame but have hesitated for
fear lest the first round should break un
der.them. I am not writing for the ex
tremesâfor the rare women of talent like
Mary Anderson, or for the numerous ig
norant people now on the boards who
ought to be scrubbing kitchen floors in
country hotels. I am writing for the edu
cated girl of fair abilities who feels a
strong Inclination to go on the stage.
In the first place, don't go if you can
earn $1000 a year In any other respectable
calling-. For a woman needs a home and
friends more than does a man, and one
curse of the theatrical profession is that
Its members during the Ions years they

And now Godowsky: From the ruck of
criticism from all quarters of this player's
work, from Berlin to IÂ»s Angeles, where
he has played during the la*t week, three
features stand out pre-eminentlyâ the
profound impression as a technician that
Godoweky has made, an equally strong

and thÂ© apparently perfect equilibrium
maintained between the two. Ho has been

Emlle Barrangon, the young Callfornlan
tenor who has been well heard in many
places about the city of late, and for
whom all kinds of good things are proph
esied, will leave San Francisco shortly to
fulfill a sixteen weeks' engagement in
Philadelphia with the Glrard Opera Com
pany. He goes to take leading parts in
"Cavallerla Rustlcana," "The Beggar
Student," "Pagliacci," "The Fencing
Master," "Chimes of Normandy" and
other standard operas, ajid besides his
traveling expenses will get $300 a month,
which might be much worse for a com
parative novice. It is Interesting to know
that Mr. Barrangon's engagement came
about through his being heard at the
Oberon during the last two weeks by
Maxim de Grosz. the musical manager of
Miss Kathryn . Kidder. DÂ© Grosz tele
graphed his discovery to the Glrard peo
ple, who immediately engaged the young
tenor.
to consideration. One among those who
have been fortunate enough to receive en
couragement at Mr. Hen3cnel's hands is
a charming, and only daughter of his,
Miss Helen Henschel, who the other day
made a most successful Informal debut
as a vocalist in Boston. Miss Henschel,
not yet IS, also plays well on the piano,
is a worthy pupil of Knelsel on the violin,
speaks two or three languages and Is pret

THE police investigation has so far revealed nothing tangible in the way of police corrup
tion, but' it has revealed much that is disreputable in political intrigue and of the ways' in
which political ambition is made to serve the corrupt and improper purposes of men and
Mayor Phelan is so far the star witness. His admissions throw a strong retroactive light
upon his public career, and explain his summary dismissal of Biggy from the Police Commission
and many other acts that have excited public wonder. The scene was memorable. The Mayor of
the greatest city on the Pacific Coast of the three Americas when asked to explain the motives
of the newspaper^to which he owes' his election answered "they are malicious."
Then followed the most remarkable revelation that a public officer has ever made to an in
vestigating body. Describing the support given to' his ambition by the Examiner he said, "We
got along very well together until I was elected Mayor under the charter.""
This is entirely credible, because up to that point the Mayor had neither power nor patron
age. His newspaper supporter had directed the charter making so as to give him both. It then
advocated the charter from the supposed standpoint of the public interest. The Mayor was sup
posed to advocate it for the same reason. But by his testimony it appears that he had contracted
a personal political debt to the Examiner which .he could not pay unless a new charter put the
means of payment into his hands. So we have the strangely interesting spectacle of a political
debtor and creditor combining to change the form of a city's government, .and increase the cost
of its administration, in order that the debtor might pay the creditor in public power and patron
age the debt contracted in the gratification of his ambition!
We are of the opinion that in all the history of American politics nothing worse than this
has appeared. There have been bargains before, and men ambitious of public distinction have
given that well understood promise to pay which goes with such bargains. But never before has
the scheme involved a costly revolution in the form of government' in order that the debtor might
seize the public assets needed to satisfy his importunate creditor. The Mayor's admissions are
expository of the one-man government provided by the charter, and explain the various "air-tight
cinches" made possible under that. instrument.
The Mayor continued that the Examiner "wanted to run San Francisco"; and why not?
The arrangement between this political debtor and his creditor was for {hat purpose. The debt
began in 1896, as the Mayor explained, and not only was the interest compounded, but the
principal was increased in 1898 and 1899.
The Mayor then told in detail the public assets demanded by his creditor in payment of
the debt which was the price of his gratified ambition. His creditor wanted control of the Police
and Fire departments, and it demanded of him also the defeat of Judge Daingerfield, as notice to
Judges not to decide against it. He said: "There is no truth in the story of a compact, but it was
understood I was to grant favors to the Examiner, and Esola was its candidate for Chief, of
The Mayor then explained that he tried to promote Esola and to earn' out the "under
standing" in other ways, but the hostility of the other papers made it impossible. As a debtor he
refused to pay his creditor out of the assets put into his hands by the new charter which both had
advocated under a pretense of public spirit. He left it plain that if the other papers had kept
silent no moral considerations would have restrained him from carrying out the "under
standing" â a word which he prefers to "compact."
If he will go to the dictionary he will find that he has juggled with synonyms in vain, for he
will find "compact" defined as "an agreement," and "an agreement" as "an understanding," and
"understanding" as "mutually understood and agreed upon."
So when he admits that there was an "understanding" with his political creditor, he admits
an. "agreement," and when he admits, an "agreement" he admits a "compact." No matter at which
end of the labyrinth of terms his reputation enters, it emerges marked with a compact, which
caused a revolution in the system of government in San Francisco and impinged thereon conse
quences of great gravity not yet visible, j i .
These admissions explain why this debtor and creditor implored the people to put the char
ter "in the hands of its friends." Unless the debtor were elected Mayor the whole plan would
fail. And when he was elected it failed because his nerve failed and he dared not face the other
papers! ...
It is an interesting revelation, and eclipses entirely the original purpose of the in
vestigation, * .
Not least among his services to music,
Mr. Henschel regards the fact that in
the course of a long career of teaching
he has succeeded in dissuading no fewer
than yw aspirants after vocal honors from
undertaking the study of singing. At
leapt. in a short gossip with him the other
day. that was the fact upon which he
seemed to lay moEt stress as his chief claim
All around these artists are people to
be heard, by teacher and student of sing
ing and other musicians alike, their de
lightful repertoire including the best song
literature of this day and of the ancients.
One small feature of the recitals which
has added much to their enjoyment Is the
programme, which contains the words of
every song sung, done into English in
case of German. French or Italian sonsrs.
The remaining thre<Â» recitals are set for
Monday evening. Wednesday afternoon
and Thursday evening.
OF your charity, rood artist
strangers in the town, be a lit

This Valentine's week is more than I can
see. The divine Sarah and M. Coquelin,
oometfian of comedians; the incompara
able Mrs. Flpke; Leopold Godowcky,
perhaps the world's jrreatest pianist: thoÂ«e
admirable artists the Hcncht's; and last,
but not least, Sousa and his famous band
âtruly an embarrassment of riches. Not
that these are not all right royally wel

The inexhauftihle ruble right willingly
would we Fpend our mbstanc? upon them;
but the first of the month has a dull, per
sistent fashion of arriving steadily with
Its bourgeois bills of butcher and baker,
and, though artists come and artists go,
our daily bread we must have. Granted
that we have' a somewhat gross notion
of the significance of the phrase, and that
man shall not live bv bread alone, but
by tho things cf beauty which God ha*
piven him ears to hear and eyes to see.
and heart, brain and hands to love, un
derstand and create, yet Is the 5-cent
"white or graham" the foundation for the
onjoyment of all these, and. r-aterialistie
or no. must come first. What one can
most profitably invest in for the good of
bis fouI Is for each personally to decide
for himself, that which may best be sacri
ficed, but thouph each may obtain some
wViere "a penny apiece to see a fine
f-how." the common exchequer will hardly
permit the substantial support of three
Oodowsky recitals, three Henschel reci
tals, eight Sousa concerts, and Bern
hardt and Mrs. Fiske r.ll In one week. Our
lÂ»enr.ied population is not sufficiently
large, and each of these attractions prac
tically draws upon the same clientele, so
that with the best intent In the world.
6nme among these artists are bound to
suffer from the unfortunate continuity of
dates. But we must e'en do me best we
can, remembering always that these
etranger-people have in their gift some of
the richest memories of a lifetime, and
they in turn must credit us with all tae
will In the world to do their service Jus
tice. If our power, as it must, falls short
of any great performance. â¢ '
â¢ â¢ â¢
Of the last week the Henschel recitals
have been easily first among musical at
tractions. Finished, and fastidiously per
fect as ever is the art of these clever
eir.gcr*. rousing anew admiration of the
excellent results attained with originally
unpromising vocal material. Mrs. Hen
echel's is a "made voice." possessing even
now only a thin sweetness of tone, but the
delightful refinement of her method, ths
delicacy of her nuances, her faultless
phrasing, her finÂ© clearness of enuncii-* â¢
tlon, her most thoroughly artistic inter
pretations, all contribute to a highly pleas
ing result. But it Is the art that appeals;
the voice Itself has no heart-touching
quality, no warmth or resonance, no va
riety of tone; the more remarkabla there
for* thÂ© unquestioned beauty of thÂ©
achieved result.
A musician par excellence Is Georg
Henschel: his accompaniments only. In
their exquisite sympathy, as far removed
from the colorless servility of one school
cf accompaniment as from thÂ© impertl
rer.t predominance of another, a sufficient
offering at the hands of one man. Every
accompaniment Is played from memory,
both for his own and Mrs. Henschel's
â¢tones, an extraordinary achievement
Â¦when the extent of these artists' reper
toire Is considered. He modulates in fa
cile and musicianly fashion from one song
to another. Improvises at need with ut
moPt ease, and In all ways shows himself
a thoroughly competent artist. In his
Flnging. perhaps Mr. Henschel's most
marked characteristic, after the admitted
technical Â«klll of his â¢work, is his power
cf getting what may be called the "local
atmosphere" of a song, the unique spirit
and sense of It. It is an extraordinary
development of the descriptive faculty,
dramatic power, if you will, as In Its less
polf-consclous phases It easily becomes,
and the limitations of his voice are for
frotten in the pictures so clearly painted.
Indeed, as I look over this plain little
talk, as I think of what theatrical life
exposes ycu toâ dangers by earth, air, fire
and flood, perils by morning, noon and
eve. Incessant traveling, unpaid sal
aries, bad hotels, enforced association,
with uncongenial companyâ as I think of
these things I wonder that you or any
other sane woman should ever want to go
upon the stage and that I should ever do
anything but vehemently attempt to dis
suade you. But when I remember, on the
other hand, that some of the best and
cleverest women In the world hava been
actresses, when I reflect that the most
charming man I have ever known Is an
actor, why, then I say: If so It must bo
with you, so let It be, and God prosper
you! Â¦Â¦Â¦'' Â¦Â¦â¢-
Never make the , mistake of beginning
In San Francisco or in any place br.t
New York. That Is the headquarters for
everything theatrical; there live the
teachers, the authors, the managersâ all
the people you must know if you are to
advance In your profession. If you can
not begin in New York, stay home.
Well. now. we will suppose you have all
the qualities named. How shall you bf
gln? Go to New York and enter ther*
one cf the dramatic schools. Many old
actors will sneer and flout at this advice;
that Is because these schools did not exist
In their day. Had they existed, these
dear men mij?ht have' learned In them to
speak grammatically off the. stage and
with correct elocution on the stageâ which
is what many of them cannot do. Go you
to school then and learn the elements
of your art, as the lawyer has to learn
In the law school the elements of his
profession and the physician In the me*l
ical school the elements of his.
Three or four thousand a year: that
pounds like a snug little sum, doesn't It?
Yes. but when you are receiving that sal
ary you can hardly spend less than a
quarter of it. and you may have to spend
half of It, on stage dresses. And how
long do you think you can hold a posi
tion that pays that much? Fifteen year*
at the most; for then you will be super
seded by a younger and more beautiful
woman. "Well, but Grandma Berr.
hardt " Ah. but you are not a Bern
hardt: not even a Itehnn"
will be ten timfs greater. I think, than if
you went upon the st.isje.
If you are not worth to the world the
sura I have named, or if your drawing to
the stage is too strong to be resisted,
think what you must have If you wcul<l
attain any success worth attaining, anil
by "success worth attaining" I mean the
prospect of making $SM> or JW> ii >var
after five or six years of hard work com
bined with untold and untenable annoy
ances. You must have youth, beauty, tal
ent, good health, unconquerable persever
ance and at least two year?" special prep
aration for your work. Have you all
these? Then ycu may at least dare to
take a hand In the preat same for pubtlc
approval that Is constantly being piayp.i
on the stafie. Have you only some or non-Â»
of these? ThÂ»n stay home.

knew of their father's marriage was when
Mrs. Stark returned and found her father
and his newly wedded wife in possession
of her home. Mrs. Stark objected to this
extra burden being added to the family,
but finally decided to make the better of
a bad bargain. A hundred dollars a
month was demanded from Mrs." Stark by I
the aged couple for their support. This
she refused. Afterward she is said to
have discovered the new Mrs. Hoyt in
toxicated On several occasions and finally
the stepmother. Mrs. Hoyt, stole all of
the silverware in the house and sold it.
This was more than Mrs. Stark would
stand and she put her stepmother out of
the house. Hoyt went with her.
Hoyt then sued his daughter for the
money he had given her and obtained
judgment, but had not realized on it be
fore his death. He took up his abode In
an old shanty that was not fit for human
habitation. There he lived on the poorest
food and cooked out of doors in sight of
his daughters' homes. When he became
sick he was bundled off to the County
Hospital. j

Will Open a Magnificent Pnotograpnlc
Studio in S. P. on His Return.
O. H. Boye, the well-known photogra
pher, left this city last evening for a trip
through Europe.
He goes direct to the art centers of the
world. He will visit England, Germany,
France and- Italy, where the most scien
tific photography and the- most artistic
studios are centered, and upon his return,
about June 1 of- this year, will open a
magnificent studio in the Callaghan build
ing:, now being: erected at Marker and Mc-
Allister streets.
This studio will be elegantly arranged
and will probably be patterned after one
of the most noted European art parlors.
Such a trip, in quest of ideas, is without
doubt an unusual undertaking, and it cer
tainly proves Mr. Boye's confidence In San
Francisco's appreciation of true art in
photography.

The Los Angeles Record has interviewed
leading oil men on the subject of the fire
test bills. F. H. Dunham of the Franklin
Refining Company said that the measure
would prevent his company from making
a burning oil that would, be. acceptable.
The fire tests :of Germany. 1 and : England
could be met by the California oils with
out difficulty. J. A. - Dubbs. president Â¦. of
the Sunset , Oil Refining Company, said
that if the bills should become the law
the Standard Oil Company would gain an
Immense advantage.. over the small com-
The bills to raise the fire test of the
illuminating oils to be sold in California
is still the center of the attack of the
oil producers and. refiners. Some account
of what has been done in the way of pro
test against the bills has previously been
published. The California Petroleum Min
ers' Association. has protested with all the
vigor that It posseses. The' Merchants"
and Manufacturers' 'Association at Los
Angeles has found several grounds for op
position and has concluded .that a fire test
of 100 degrees is the proper thing.
The Colusa Herald Is authority for the
statement that there is a flow of thlrty
flve barrels of oil per day on Bear Creek.
The Herald says that "this puts an end
to all speculation as to whether oil in
paying quantities exists in Colusa
County." . Â¦";Â¦;''
. The price paid by a San Francisco syn
dicate for sections 36, 23, 28, In Kern Coun
ty, Is reported to be 5200,000. General W.
H. H. Hart was concerned in making the
deal. The entire section is off the dem
onstrated belt. Development work will
begin at once.
The failure of the- Btorar* and Transporta
tion Company to renew contracts with the local
producers and the failure of thÂ« producers to
come to any satisfactory undemanding as to
the marketing of the product through a com
mon channel Is beginning to be felt. â¢Â¦ Oil was
offered yÂ«sterday in the Exchange, of 14 grav
ity, at 80 cents at the wells. Oil of 19 gravity
was offered at U f. o. b. Los Angeles. - It now
appears to be every man for himself â¢ in the
local field, and the result is as it might be ex
pected under the circumstances. The move
ment to establish another - producers' associa
tion, which shall build storage tanks and
transact business on the basis adopted by the
Kern County producers, Is ' not making much
headway. In the meantime prices are being
pounded down and the producer is suffering
from It. , ...Â¦ .
"There is now no uniform price for local
oil," says the Times, "and purchasers
have been taking advantage, of -this lack
of unity and bidding lower and lower,
until dollar oil is now a thing of the
past. It was reported yesterday that oil
had been sold by some producers who
have limited tankage accommodations at
80 cents. The majority of the producers,
however, are holding their product at
much higher figures and will try to ad
vance prices."
The Los Angeles Herald gives a similar
account of the situation In Los Angeles.
In part It says:
The Los Angeles Times reports that the
bottom has fallen out of the local petro
leum market and that prices are generally
demoralized In the south. The failure of
the producers to stand together is mei
tloned as the principal reason for this
condition of affairs.
The decision of Judge Day in the case
of the San Francisco Savings Union
against the It. G. R. Petroleum and Min
ing Company, in Santa Barbara County,
will be appealed. Judge Day has decided
that an oil company which has acquired
a mineral claim to a strip of land under
the ocean cannot erect a wharf in front
of the land of another, restricting ingress
and egress by sea. The future proceed
ings, if they reach the Supreme Court of
the United States, will cause general In
terest, for the issue concerns a phase of
the oil industry that has been getting a
footing from Rincon to Conception and
may spread all over the Pacific Coast.
The value of the permit issued by the
"War Department far the building of a
wharf is also under, consideration by the
courts. - .
And there are other causes which to the ob
servant person remove all fear of overpro
duction of petroleum in our State. Probably
not a third of the manufacturing and other
concerns which could profitably use oil as a
fuel are now purchasing that product.
It is true that the purposes to which the
products of the two sections are put are very
different, the Eastern oil being lamely con
verted into Ulumiuatits. while the Western
product is chiefly devoted to fuel purposes. In
deed, it was supposed for a long time that It
was impossible to refine the California product
profitably. This conclusion was due to the
fact that our best oils produced only about 25
per cent of illumination oil, which has always
been looked upon as llxlnar the value of an oil
for refining -purposes. Our oil having an
asphaltum base, varying from 10 to 36 per cent,
that product has become the basis of profitable
rennlnc of California oils, but in addition to
asphaltum. the various refineries now engaged
in refining California oil obtain numerous by
products, the whole aggregating- a. value which
has been estimated as high as $3,000,000 per an
num. The demand for the lighter oils for re
fining purposes is constantly on the increase,
and I confidently predict that during this year
the refineries of .this State will require at least
double the amount consumed by them during
the rast year.
The one greatest need of the oil industry Is
a large and unfailing supply, and anything
which tends to accomplish tnls will be of ulti
mate benent, although it might result in lem
pcrary depression of the market. This conclu
sion is not the result of conjecture, but of ac
tual experience. The history of oil production
throughout the Kast has shown that as the
product was increased the price was not cor
respondingly decreased, but " assumed a sta
bility which it had not known in earlier years.
In 1S79 the Eastern fields produced less thai
19,000.000 barrels, and oil was then sold as low
as 49 cents per barrel. To-day, with a pro
duction of. 37,000.000. it is sold for tl 25 pel
barrel.
The history of oil production in this State
shows that in 1S77 mere were produced bul
13.000 barrels; in 1S39, 2.677,875 barrels. Com
plete returns for the year ltfOO cannot now be
obtained, but as the increase in ivt'i .over the
previous year was 42S.7S7* barrels and develop
ments during: the past year have been enor
mously greater than during the previous year,
it is certainly safe to assume that the pro
duction for 1900 was, in round numbers, not
less than 4,GO0,CC0 barrels.
"Upon the basis of three and a half
barrels of oil to one ton of coal," said
the speaker, "it will be readily seen that
until the annual production of oil exceeds
7,000,000 barrels it cannot displace the coal
now used for fuel and steam purposes."
There were other statements of general
interest which the student of conditions
may study with profit. Among them are
the following:
Some statements were made at the first
annual banquet of the Los Angeles Stock
Exchange that may assure the oil men
of the benefit of :he industry In which
they are engaged to the State. One of
the speakers. at tho banquet. ex-Senator
Bulla, said that In the year 1899 there
were Imported Into California 1,740,279 tons
of coal. As there Is comparatively little
coal mined in this State he assumed that
the demand for oil, under existing con
ditions, will be practically measured by
the coal imported.

Reasons Given for Belief in Perma-
Yesterday afternoon before the "struck
oil" telegram of the El Oro Company was
publicly known the shares were quoted
at $1 and New Era shares at 20 cents.
?
MATCHING OIL AGAINST OOAL.
The well is located about a mile and a
half from Bakersfield, near the tracks
of the Southern Pacific, and to make the
find more valuable the Standard Oil Com
pany a few months ago erected three
large tanks in close proximity to the El
Oro well. The company drilled down just
1050* feet before tapping the big gusher.
Mr. Mills, in speaking of the lucky
strike on the part of those who had in
vested In the company, stated that the
company was composed almost entirely
of persons connected with the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank. Mills reports that the
New Era Oil Company, which also has
leased land In close proximity to the El
Oro well, would be benefited by the strike,
as the two wells being so close together
it is almost certain that the New Kra will
also strike a spouter.
W. H. Mills received word yesterday
that the El Oro Oil Company, which has
leased a tract of land in Kern County
from the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany, known as section 7, had struck a
big gusher of oil. A dispatch that one of
the officials sent to W. Gregg Jr. of the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank, who is presi
dent of the company, stated that judging
from the abundance of oil that is pouring
out this well will prove one of the richest
ell wells ever located in the State.
panles in this State. Edward Strasburgr.
manager of the Oil Storage and Supply
Company, said that the Standard Oil Com
pany would be benefited, but not the Cali
fornia producers. R. H. Herron declared
that the measures were calculated to In
jure the oil industry In California.
Summerland and Hanford are both talk
ing about the establishment of exchanges
in their respective localities.
San Diego has an oil company that has
incorporated with a capital stock of $5,
000,000, divided into 5,000.000 shares, at $1
each. The operations are to be carried on
in New Mexico.
The Inyo Independent gives an account
of the movements of the oil men upon
inyo County. Locations made last week
in the Owens Lake basin amount to 39G0
acres, and there had previously been en
tered by the oil men 5920 acres. Below
Little Lake the Salt Wells Valley has
been filed on more or less.
A new field is to be exploited In Kern
County. This is in the northern part of
the county and is twenty miles north of
the Kern River. The exploiters are the
stockholders of a company organized in
Porterville.
The McWhorter Oil Refinery at Kern
na8 been .compelled to enlarge and four
new 6tills will be put in directly. The re-
Mn ry was 8tart ed recently with only ona
still, but the experiment seems to war
rant extension according to the accounts
received.
Steps have been taken for the formation
of an oil association in Shasta County. A
committee' on organization has been en
trusted with the task of devisingr a plan
that will hold the associated oil compa
nies together. Each incorporated com
pany in the county Is represented on the
committee.
Slnce January 1, as reported by tha
Cnico Record, 2660 acres in what is known
as the Hesperian district have been locat
ed as mining claims. A recapitulation
shows that there are twenty-two oil
companies already organized that are
pinning their faith to that locality.
â¢A- F. Lucas, one of the owners of the
big oil well at Beaumont, Texas, writoi
to the Oil Reporter that "at the rate of
SOOO barrels per day the well would pr>
duce nearly 3.000,000 barrels per year, and
at B0 cents per barrel would pay 10 per
cent on $15,000,000. He admits that thce
is no probability that the well will have
anv such yield for any length of time. The
lexas district is twenty miles from tide
water on the gulf. Sabine Pass and Po-t
Arthur being the nearest shipping points.
Pipe lines are being talked of. but the
question of market is yet secondary to the
handling and storage.
The operations in Monterey County are
progressing: and hope is strong that gool
results will bo obtained in the shape of
oil in paying quantities. Four companies
are drilling in the southern end of tha
countyâ the Monterey, Salinas, Great
American and Tomboy. The Naciemento
Oil Company, a Los Angeles corporation,
has begun operations. The Monterey
Company Is down 800 feet. The Normal is
about ready to drill. The San Antonio
Company, two miles from San Ardo, "is
down 700 feet. The Arroyo Seco Company
has contracted for a standard rip and will
soon be drilling. The Great American
well is still sinking and is down some
thing more than 100 feet.
The Armljo Oil Company has been in
corporated under the laws of Arizona.

[ A CAUSE OF HEADACHE.
One Very Common Cause, Generally
. Overlooked.
Headache Is a symptom, an indication
of derangement or disease In some organ,
and the cause of the headache Is difficult
to locate 'Because so many diseases have
headache as a prominent symptom; de-
rangement of the stomach and liver, heart
trouble, kidney disease, > lung trouble, eye
strain or Ill-fitting; glasses all produce
headaches, and if we could always locate
the organ which is at fault the cure of
obstinate headaches would be a much
simpler matter.
However, for that form of headache
called frontal headache, pain back of the
eyes- and in forehead, the cause is now
known to be . catarrh of the head and
throat; when the headache is located in
back of head and neck it Is often caused
from catarrh of the stomach or liver.
At any rate, catarrh is the most com-
mon cause of such headaches and the
cure of the catarrh causes a prompt dis-
appearance of the headaches.
There is at present no treatment for
catarrh so convenient and effective as
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a new Internal
remedy in tablet form, composed of anti-
septics like Eucalyptol. Guaiacol and
Blood Root, which act upon the blood and
cause the elimination of the catarrhal poi-
son from the system through the natural
channels.
Miss Cora Ainsley. a prominent school
teacher in one of our normal schools,
speaks of her experience with catarrhal
headaches and eulogizes Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets as a cure for them. She says:
"I suffered daily from severe frontal
headache and pain In and back of the
eyes, at times so Intensely as to Incapa-
citate me in my dally duties. I had suf-
fered from catarrh more or less for years
but never thought it was the cause of my
headaches, but finally became convinced
that such was the case, because the head-
aches were always worse whenever I had
a cold or fresh attack of catarrh.
"Stuart's Catarrh Tablets were highly
recommended' to' me as a safe and pleas-
ant catarrh cure, antl -after using a few
50-cent boxes which . I procured from my
druggist. I was eurprlfed and delighted
to find that both the catarrh and head-
aches had gone for good."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by
druggists at fifty cents per package, un-
der the guarantee of the proprietors that
they- contain absolutely no cocaine (found
in so many catarrh cures), no opium (so
common in cheap cough cures), nor any
harmful drug. They contain simply the
wholesome antiseptics necessary to de-
stroy and drive from the system the
germs of catarrhal disease.

ported the presence of a crazy. Chinaman
in the woods. The officers found him and
he gave his name aa Wong Kim. He was
taken to Captain Seymour's office, as it
was thought he was a fugitive Chinese
murderer. The detectives were not able
to recognize him, however, and he was re
turned to the Jail, where a charge of va
grancy was placed against him. It seems
that the Chinaman preferred living in the
woods to a residence with his own people.

A Profitable Investment.
Jno. Blakely of W. Lebanon. Pa., re-
ports that he cot more value from Jl.CO
Â¦worth of Grape-Nuts food than from W0
spent in noted hospitalH, trying to set well
from stomach trouble. He says: "After
all my' experience. I had to ume home
thinking there was no cure for me. I was
6O weak and nervous I co-uld hardly waJk,
and for three years I hadn't a good
night's Bleep. I was run down until I only
Â¦weighed 120 pounds.
"I commenced using Grape-Nuta about
a year ago and now 1 weigh 163 pounds
and can do as cood a day's work as any
oneJ When I go to oed I sleep all night
peacefully and am refreshed in the morn-
Ing. I use Grape-Nuts " food every day
and know it is the greatest bie:sinc thÂ»t
ever was sent to suffering humanity. I
believe if It had not been for this food I
would have been under the Bod before
this.** There is a reason. No food in ex-
istence contains, in a concentrated form,
the elements that will rebuild the nerve
centers and the brain, as Grape-Nuts, and
the beauty of the food is that it is per-
f ectry cooked at the factory and by the
process of manufacture is predigested in.
a natural way. therefore requires but
trifling power of tho stomach to digest it.

Interpreter lUillard Says Chines*
Spoke of Bribing Chief Sullivan
and Wittman.
Jerome XtiHard was then 'called and tes
tified that he was a Chinese interpreter
to the courts of this city and county.' He
had acted as interpreter for twenty years.
He was in Chinatown every day. He
talked ' freely with Chinese and mingled
with them.
"I know," said the witness, "all the
gamblers by sight. I have known QwonÂ£
Hlng. Chan Chin. Sail* Jose Charlie. Buck
eye and "Wong^ Fook for many years.
They are Â¦ all . interested in- gambling
houses. I, have talked with Qwong Hing
about police protection. Â¦ He acknowledged
to me that gamblers were to pay for.po
lice protection. -He asked me how. the
white people felt about Chinese gambling
and running houses of ill fame. I can
not remember all -the conversation I "had
with' the men mentioned. This occurred
three years ago. They. told me they be
longed to a committee to secure police
protection for the gamblers and keepers
of the dens. Qwong King told me that
the future management of the . gambling
houses would be in the hands of Chief
Sullivan and Captain Wittman. This was
three weeks ago. I have talked with them
about a corruption fund. '.They said they
had to pay the police- for'; the privilege
of gambling. They spoke of Sergeant
Brophy as the man who collected the
money once a week."
"For what purpose did they say they
gave the money to the police?"
"To secure immunity from arrest.**
"Who told you this?"
!"Quon> Been and another , man whose
name I cannot remember. Â¦ They said the*
gra.ve the money uÂ»- Brophy once a. vews
They said the rate paid was $10 for %
gambling house and lotteries.. They wM
"I have. Captain Wittman helped to
close up the highbinders. If that work
had been kept up they would all have
been driven out of the city. To-day they
are very much alive."
"How do you know that?"
"On account of the frequent murders in
Chinatown. I have seen Chinese men ac
cost white men and ask them to go in to
the houses of ill fame." â¢â¢ Â»
ACCUSING TESTIMONY
AGAINST THE POLICE
"Have the lookouts for the gambling
places been as . active tn the ' past few
months as they were previously?"
"No. theyt have not. but the -solicitors
for the lottery places have been most ac
tive. They accost people passing alonx
and say to them, Tickets, gentlemen;
tickets, gentlemen. It Is as easy to go
Into one of those lottery places an <t Is
to come Into this courtroom." â¢"
"What remarks have you heard the
Chinese make as to the air of tranquillity
y.ou have spoken of V
"I have heard them say the tranquil
state was not secured for nothing. The
gamblers seem to be having a good time.
The lookouts have been withdrawn and
the places seem to run without interfer
ence."
"Knowing the Chinese as yoa do, what
would you Infer from the remarks you
heard that the tranquil* time was not se
cured for nothing?"
"I inferred that gambling was to be al
lowed to go unmolested."
"Have you ever complained to the po
lice of the conditions of Chinatown?"
by their owners. They are brutally treat
ed and intimidated. I have often seen
signs Â¦ displayed annoncing girls for sale.
There is not* the slightest doubt In my
mind that the sign I have translated is
a sign announcing the sale of human be
ings. I recently translated similar signs
for Captain Wittman."
"I have not heard them so talking, but
there .was a feeling in the air that some
thing of the kind existed. - As the Chinese
say, there .was a' tranquil air. The num
ber of lights in front of the gambling and
lottery places were increased and the
.Chinese would go in and out of- these
places in a free manner, not at all
alarmed or careful."
"What do you know. of the slave trade?"
VAsa Federal officer I am most famil
iar with it. I have prevented the landing
of many girls destined for. the slave dens.
.1 have rescued many girls. from the dens
while aiding the ladies of' the missions"
"Do you know of girls being sold in
Chinatown?" Â¦Â¦*...
"I do. I have one in myxcharge' now
.who was recently rescued from a house of
ill-fame by the mission people. The girl
is a minor.. She will be deported to China
: by, order of the Federal courts. Girls res
cued from the slave dens have told me tn
the mission homes the prices they were

I do not. It is an easy matter to recog

the street. These houses exist in Sullivan

asked If he had ever seen a sign like it
displayed In front of a gambling place.
He answered in the negative.
"The gambling house signs are mostly
written on white paper. I have seen
signs like this posted on the street cor
ners.- I was in Chinatown when a report
er asked me to translate this sign. I did
so and he tore it down. It was posted up
on the corner of Sacramento and Dupont
streets on the southwest side."

"I will give you a free translation. It
reads as follows: 'The stock in trade and

place as being a "big Chinese restaurant."
The witness denied that he had made any
previous arrangements for: the game, but
divulged the fact that he had made ar
rangements with a white man to take Mr.
Wright and the witness to the same. This
admission caused a, loud, laugh.. In the

Yesterday's Ssssion Produces Impor
tant Testimony From Men of
Standing in Community. *
.While yesterday's. sessions of the legis
lative- committee's investigation of the
Police Department were devoid' of any
sensational features, the testimony was
of a most Important character.
That gambling and vice had Joined
hands to corrupt the Police Department
was testified to by ex-Chief of Police
Crowley, who not only had heard a' few
years ago that some of his officers were
dishonest, but had been approached him
self with the view of allowing the criminal
element, of Chinatown to ue guaranteed
Immunity.
Another important fact was brought out,
namely, that Chinese (ramblers and lot
tery dealers had openly claimed that they
had . paid money to Chief Sullivan and
Captain Wittman. The testimony, was
merely hearsay, but sue" as It .was it
behooves the Chief and his captain to dis
prove it. .-"'., V * V- â¢...';Â¦
Flaring immorality and the barter for
gold of human chattels were told of by
Rev. Dr. John E. Gardner who is. with
out doubt, the best qualified man In the
United States to testify as to the. doings
of the Chinese in this city. For many
years Dr. Gardner has waged war against
the slave dealers In his capacity as Chi
nese inspector and Interpreter for the
Federal Government. His testimony yes
terday might have referred to the city of
Peking rather than to San Francisco, bo
terrible were the facts disclosed.
Dr. Gardner also testified that it is as
J*z.sy to get into a Chinese gambling game
iH it is to enter a courtroom in the Hall
X* Justice. He has beard also that
gambling in Chinatown appears to go on
without . interference through . some, ar
rangement with 6crce j one. t The" houses
are being beautified and are being made
The next witness was the Rev. Dr
Gardner, who translated a notice which
h js been and is now posted on the walls
cf Chinese. It is -a notice and announce
ment of the sale of slave girls who are
held in bondage in Suluvan alley. This
19 the first instance, perhaps, in this city
in a Judicial inquiry where the authorita
tive statement has been made that San
Francisco is to-day a slave market. Not
only this, but Dr. Gardner told of other
elgns which showed that in Chinatown to
day Chinese girls are for sale. This, in a
v.ay, is one of the most startling bits of
tÂ»silmony sriven at the investigation.
Ab far as police corruption is concerned
ex-Chief Crowley said that twenty years
apo there was corruption in the depart
ment and twenty-three men were dis
missed for dishonesty. What the -charac
ter of the present administration may be
the witness did not presume to say.
..bout 6lx years ago ex-Chief Crowley
eald that a deliberate effort was made to
bribe him. He was offered $6000 if he
would permit abandoned women to live
on the first floors of houses. He, of
course, declined to do so.
Hlfl testimony consequently was of ex
treme Interest. He said that the great
obstacle to the suppression of gambling
Is the extreme difficulty under which the
police- must secure competent evidence.
The Chinese use implements in their gam
bling which are apparently Innocent. As
far as Captain Wittman is concerned.
Chief Crowley said that he had never
found anything which convinced him of
the dishenesty of that officer. When the
charges were brought . several years ago
against Captain Wittman. ex-Chief Crow
ley said that be believed the charges to
t>e true- Investigation convinced him,
however, of his error.
Ex-Chief cf Police Patrick Crowley was
one of the most interesting witnesses of
the day. His testimony left no doubt
upon at least two points of the Inquiry.
He- declared that It Is extremely difficult
and always has been for the Police^De
;.artner.t to 6uppress gambling - la the
Chinese district." Further^ than that Chief
Crowley said that there* Is no question
that In times past there has been corrup
tion in the Police-Department in reference
to Chinese. Not only was this the fact,
but Chief Crowley declared that an effort
was even made to bribe him.
>^>cHE courtroom was crowded to the
j I doers yesterday morning: when the
1 1 legislative investigators resumed
H their Inquiry. The affair has been,
a subject of Â»r eat Public Interest
since Its commencen.ent and the develop
ments of each day simply 4dd to
* this Interest. .The police ' placed a
witness on the stand yesterday and
had the chagrin of knowing that
they had committed a most serious
blunder. They called E. A. Finn, a watch
man employed by Chinese. He has worked
In Chinatown for ten years and . swore
that he never saw to his own knowledge
b. house < 1 ha/i repute or a gambling house
In the district. That sort of testimony
had the expected effect upon the commit
tee. John Boyle, the Examiner reportc-,
told how he had secured for Assemblyman
Wright the privilege of playing fantan.

by f. e. 2s/rcTL.i3:ox J i J A.3snD.
ALTHOUGH marred to. some extent
by a heavy and somewhat lumpy
track to race over, a large and
fashionable crowd paw Janice,
pporting the purple with white
cap of Green Morris, win the California
Oaks for three-year-old fillies at Tanforan
Park yesterday.
The ovent carried with it a gross valu
ation cf $4050. cf which amount the win
ner took $Â£Â»). Eight dainty misses con
tested for the rich prize. Janice had Bull
man In the paddle and 117 pounds, this
including a Feven pound winning penalty.
She apparently possessed the class over
her field and in the books was held a 1 to
2 chance. Starting with Edna Brown, the
frecdnd choice at odds of 5 to 1. the prices
against the other soared as high as la to
1. At the post there was no perceptible de
lay. Starter Dwyer dispatching the bunch
prettily aligned. Mounce. on Maresa, im
mediately went to the front, and when
less than a. mile had been covered all be
hind the leader with the exception of the
favorite were hopelessly out of it. Not
until the paddock was reached did Bull
man, astride Janice, get up with the out
sider, and then in a hard drive won by
half a length only. Edna Brown finished
third. Fix lengths before Bonnie Lissak.
Favoritc-s treated the talent consider
ately, finishing in front on four different
occasions, all well backed. In the ring,
eighteen pencllers did a thriving business.
The most unexpected downfall of the
afternoon occurred in the mile and a six
teenth handicap, when The Lady.' carry
ing 111 pounds, was beaten by Vulcain.
The Lady for the ilrst time ran in the
name of J. Tod Blcan, and at 3 to 5 was
extensively backed. Getting badVy
bumped at the first turn and showing no
marked fancy for the going, the game
little mare was beaten out two lengths
by Vulcain, which horse made all thÂ©
running. "Ringmaster" Henry piloted
the winner. Favonius, the top weight,
â¢was a non-starter.
Tod Sloan's other purchase, though.
Credo, ran a remarkably good raceÂ»in the
steeplechase over une and three-quarter
miles and seven Jumps. Shouldering the
heavy Impost of 170 pounds and again
ridden by Sutherland, the Morello gelding
Â¦was never headed. When finally chal-.
lenped at the end by old J O C he stood
a Jong drive, earning the verdict by half
a length. To the second horse Credo was
conceding forty-five pounds and lumps of
weight to all of the others starters. At
the last jump Lomo fell, breaking his
back. He was destroyed.
An even money favorite. Torsina â¢ led
from flag-fall in the opening sprint, win
ning ridden out rrom Boundlee. Presti
digitator sulked, finishing fourth, behind
liTeh Hoe.
Consistent as usual, Wyoming downed
a field of four for the mile selling event.
Backed down to 8 to 5 favoritism. O'Con
nor handled the aged gelding with his
UEual cleverness, and at the wire won
hands down from Handicapper anfl
Owensboro.
Â« Â», > t t t. hope of a truce being declared
t\ Â¦ .'has now passed, and there la ap-,
/AV parently no prospect of averting
ATjX'the clash between the San Fran
cisco Jockey 'Club, with head
quarters at Tanforanu Park, and.the Cali
fornia Jockey Club, whose plant Is lo
cated at Emeryville. Both sides have for
tified themselves, and thÂ© struggle which
means so much -to the racing interests of
the State will begin to-morrow.
'Down at Tanforan previous to the rac
ing ," yesterday, the president, of. the
.San" Francieco . Jockey '.Club addressed
the assembled horsemen In the pad
dock, and in the maple room of the
Palace Hotel; Thomas H. .Williams 'Jr..
president of rival Jockey club, had a
friendly ' talk:., with the owners, riders,
-Jockeys and- bookmakers congregated.-
In speaking of the hostilities about to
Commence, 'the president ol tne San Fran
cisco Jockey Club in part said to
the. horsemen: . "But one side can
win. If "horsemen are permitted to race
their horses at both tracks at will, neith
er side can win. Â¦ That is the reason the
San Francisco â¢ Jockey Club has decided
to refuse the entries of owners who race
at Oakland. It would not look right for
Burns & Waterhouse to win both of the
big - staJces,-~ therefore - the firm's S entries
cannot -be received."
'Immediately following: this, the book
makers were taken into council by the
president. Among other things they were
informed that if fifteen or more firm* cut
in on Monday, but $100 per day would be
charged Instead of the customary $20 a
race. : .
The press was also furnished 'with the
following statement by the Tanforan pres,
ident: . . .
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 9. 1901.
The - San Francisco Jockey Club, has no
I agreement whatever with the California Jockey
Club. The corporation was formed .last Sep
tember and obtained a lease for, ten years first
of the Tanforan racetrack, and second, of In
gleside racetrack. All of the contracts or
agreements then in existence expired with the
EOinK out of business of . the Western Turf
Association and the Pacific Coast Jockey Club.
At least our lawyers at the time reported that
there were no aKreements or contracts bind
ing the assigns of either of these corporations.
ThU was so perfectly clear in my mind that
1 made it a point to nee at once Mr. William*
and ask him if he did not want to come to
some understanding and make an agreement
for five. or ten years on some lines that would
be both beneficial and agreeable to their asso
ciation and ours. I had three hours' talk with
him, telling him the general policy and object
of the new Jockey club, explaining to him
that all of the men that had fought him In
the past had been bought out by the new
comers, and there were no reasons why sonic
agreement or understanding could not te
reached with him. I endeavored to obtain from
him that we should programme to the exten;
of employing the same judges and starter and
most of the officials, so as not to submit th;.
owners. Jockeys and trainers to two jurisdic
tions not always harmonious.
Mr. Williams Il5teaed to me moat courteous
ly, but flatly refused any and all of my prop
ositions. He frankly told me that any man
'working for us would not find employment
on his track, and added that he had to speak
to .me this way because, although during this
â¢winter wo wouli* alternate dates by next
spring we might come together again, but
that nothing could be done for the â¢ present.
All that was reached, therefore, was a tem
porary "modus' vlvemil." The temporary na
ture of this tras well demonstrated to us
when as early as December we could ! find
that strings that had been laid as . early as
April, 1900, were being pulled against us from
various directions, all traceable to the same
orlKln. that Is, to the -California Jockey Club
and Its friends. We patiently recorded every
detail of tt, > standing it for the good of the
sport as long as our patience lasted.
â¢ I personally, deplore the situation more than
I- can tell, and I have had more than one
meeting with, my associates before deciding
upon the course which has now been taken.
We have -the confidence ol the public, of thÂ«
horsemen and of the. racing element to which
we cater- â¢ We .. have also confidence in* the
common sense of the public at large, which
always follows the people who mean to do
well.
None of the men interested in the San Fran
cisco Jockey Club have - cared to make money
out of It. In fact If In five or ten years it
cost them money to give seventy-five or eighty
days' racing during the heart of each winter
they have made up their minds to stand the
loss; not only for the good of racing, but for
the benefit ot tBe city of San Francisco and
their own : Racing In the future
will have to be of a higher class and will
begin In the middle of November and end
very rarly in April.
The California Jockey Club must realize that
the . people of tho San Francisco Jockey Club
are here to stay, and that money and time
will- be of â¢ little consideration to reach one
result, which is desired by every one, that
is to limit racing around San Francisco and
put It on such a basis that the trouble* and
quarrels surrounding racing during- the past
fix years will never be heard of again.
" Shortly after 8:1S o'clock last evening
Thomas H. Williams Jr. entered the
maple room of the Palace Hotel, and
reviewed the situation before a packed
and interested audience. The speaker be
gan with referring to the old Bay District
days, when he and his associates assumed
control of the racing situation and incor
porating under the name of the California
Jockey C luD became liable for the $96,000
debt of the defunct Pacific Coast Blood
Horse Association. He then referred in
sarcastic terms to the utter lack of court
esy on the part of tne San Francisco
Jockey Club, -in thus far failing to offi
cially notify the California Jockey Club of
its Intention to race on and break the con
tract existing between the two organiza
tions. President Williams next dwelt on
the numerous untruthful reports circu
lated with a view of Injuring the Oakland
track, taking up especially the one that
gained some credence, purporting to be a
telegram sent by Colonel; D. M. Burns
from Mexico, resigning his position as an
officer, of the California Jockey Club. In
denying that any such message was sent
Mr. -Williams said: "If Colonel Dan Burns
sent anything, he would send the Candela-'
ria . mine, ..with . .Its ~ yield - of $100,000 a
month," which caused a loud outburst of
applause. The uphill fight of the club
against big odds for ten years, until it
finally became a flourishing game, was
then taken up.
"About this time." said the Oakland
president, "the president of the San Fran
cisco Jockey Club appears on the scene
and says he intends to 'elevate the
sport.'" In refutation of this state
ment attention was "called to the
fact that warned-ofC and ruled-off per
sons had been allowed to pass through
the Tanforan gates, and tho question
was propounded, "Is this elevating the
sport?"
A remark that drew forth applause
was that "no horseman In need had ever
been turned away or denied assistance
by the California Jockey Club," and that
if, sick or in want of medical attendance
he had been sent to a hospital and treated
without charge.
Concluding, Mr. Williams extended an
invitation to all horsemen and riders- in
good standing to take part in the racing
at Oakland. "This Is a free country and
you are all free men," he said, "but If
you can see your way clear and it is to
your advantage I wouM like to have you
come. I will bo different," said he,
"from- the president of the San Francisco
Jockey Club in refusing the entries . of
Burns & Waterhouse at Tanforan, for' I
extend a hearty invitation to him to race
at Oakland until the season ends on
May 1." .
The horsemen then dispersed to, talk
over the situation. Â¦
There seems to be no advantage on
either side, as there will be no scarcity of
riders, bookmakers or horses at either
track. The president of the San Fran
clsco,-Jockey Club Intimates that Tan
forartis backed by a syndicate of wealthy
men.'attd Thomas H. Williams Jr. does
not appear fearful ot the' result. Rumor
has. lj, that free transportation Is to be
given/ patrons, of the San Mateo County
track; but it lacks confirmation.

gave a smart performance. The youngster
was friendly to the pikers, bringing them
4 for 1 by his winning work. Honor Bright
led and beat the fast Ireland, after an
undecided, at 2 to 1.
Representative, Cheetham & Parting
ton's recent importation, closed the round
by outfooting McComb's Bona Fide by a
score of 6 to 2. and breaking the long
string of victories for the favorites.
Palo Alto looks to have the best chance
for the stake, with Wedgewood, Fiery

eeasoned Lottie M. a 4 to 1 favorite.
Rural Artist, a 2 to 1 favorite over Mas
ter Lawrence, stumbled after leading four
lengths and before he could get In the go
ing again his opponent had won out. I
The second course of the day was a
double "bye" between Kanaka and Van
dal. The wipe ones figured. Cronin's hound
a cinch and set the price at 6 to 1 on his
chance for the flag, but Kanaka landed
and gave the short-enders their first en
couragement. Â¦ ' 'Â¦: Â¦ Â¦ : '.
The rundown of the ninety-six dog open
stake at Union Coursing: Park yesterday
furnished good sport to a large crowd of
patrons. Form players were good at pick
ing winners, though ' the nine upsets/re
corded against their Judgment came, in at
better than the average odds.

Russell Palmer of Boston gave an inter

the reception room of the Palace Hotel to
demonstrate the possibillties-'of. liquid air
as a refrigerating and scientific discovery.
Mr Palmer is a brother of Edmund
Palmer, who has lectured extensively in
the East on the properties of liquid air.
and had for his audience last night many
prominent physicians and scientists.
In a retort about as large as an ordinary
soap box was contained a gallon of liquid
air made four weeks ago in Boston. In
being transferred to a glass globe the air
has the color and consistency of sea wa

poured on a wooden table produces seem
ingly the same effect as water poured on
a hot stove. ,, _ ,
For his first experiment Mr. Palmer
poured the liquid air into a glass filled
wHh cranberries. In twenty seconds the
berries were removed frozen stilt, and aa
hard as pebbles. The air was of a tem
perature of 312 degrees below zero. Among
the most Interesting demonstrations was

Camera Club Entertainment
FUN fast and furious, gay music
and startling costumes were
the characteristics of the
grand annual masquerade ball
of the Grutli Vereln, held In
Turner Hall, Turk street, last night.
The dancing commenced at 8:30 with a
few couples, but soon the alluring mu
sic and contagious merriment drew on
the other maskers till., the floor was
filled. More than two hundred couples
took part in the, festivities.
Refreshments, liquid and otherwise,
served throughout the evening, were
of the kinds Â¦which help to moke life
pleasant in the "Vaterland," and the
sweet old German tunes and mirth and
dancing were typical of the sunny
vineyards on the banks of the Rhine.
The costumes were highly original
and amusing and the merry dancers
did not allow interest to flag. Unmask
ing occurred at midnight.
Prince Carnival was O. Imdorf, and

throughout the evening. Long before
the appointed hour the floor was filled
with Impatient merrymakers and at 9
o'clock the gay, multi-colored throng,
nearly six hundred strong, took up the
grand march to the tune of "Stars
and Stripes Forever."
The music and costumes were all
that could be desired and frolic and
laughter were the rule of the hour.
The feature of the event was the
award of cash prizes ranging from $3
to $17 50 to the amount of $100 for
original and amusing costumes. This
was an incentive to new and pleasing
effects and the result was ample re
ward for all concerned." Enthusiasm
and. pleasure ran high throughout the
night. Refreshments were served at
all hours. Unmasking took place at 12
o'clock and the festivities lasted till
daybreak.

appeared Mrs. Pescia advised the family
not to send for a physician and said that
the unfavorable symptoms would disap
pear In a few days. The contrary was the
case, and when a physician was sum
moned it was late,, blood poisoning hav
ing set In already. Mrs. Pescia. had had
a dispute with the family concerning the
amount of her fee and refused to con
tinue her attendance on the poor woman.
The Jury returned a verdict that death
was due to "blood poisoning caused by
not having timely medical attendance,
and we further censure Mrs. Katherine
Pescia for neglect"
Coroner Leland read Mrs. Pescia a se
vere lecture on her mercenary and un
professional conduct, a lecture that was
applauded by the jury and the spectators.
The verdict in the Stone case was that
death followed a criminal operation per
formed by unknown parties. â¢

wife Katherine Fescia.
OAKLAND. Feb. 9.â The relatives
of Mary M. Seely, the young
wife of Frank M. Seely, who
killed her and himself last night
at 835 Franklin street, after she
refused to surrender their child to him.
have reached the conclusion that Seely de
liberately planned to murder his wife in
the event that he should be unsuccessful
in his quest. They base that belief upon
the fact that on the day he left Portland,
Oregon, for San Francisco he mailed to
Mrs. Seely a letter which they declare
was written to conceal his presence here.
That letter Mrs. Seely received "Wednes
day and it stated flatly that the writer
Intended to make a trip to Baker City,
Oregon, and possibly to Salt Lake, on bus
iness connected with an estate in wblcn
the couple were interested. .
Within a few hours after he mailed tne
Mrs. D. B. Ladd. 3istar of the slain
woman, and her husbnd, who Is a clerk at
the Hotel St. James, San Jose, and George
Drummond. a brother, also of San Jose,
arrived here early this morning to takÂ«j
charge of affairs. The sister and
brothers made immediate arrangements
to have Mrs. Seely's remains shipped to
morrow to their former home at Clover
dale, near Portland. Mrs. Ladd will ac
company the body. The husband's re
mains are in charge of Coroner Mehr
mann. He is awalti.'ier final instructions
from the relatives of the dead man at
Portland. A dispatch was received by the
Coroner this morning, 3igned by T. D.
Hughes?, chief conductor of Mount Hood
Division. Order Railway Conductors, and
by John Seely, father o: the suicide, to
prepare the body for shipment and await
further word. Chief of Police MqLaugn
lin of Portland, a relative of the Ladds.
sent a dispatch to Chief of Police Hodg
kins on the same subject. There appeared
to be some conflict, which will necessitate
a delay until definite instructions are re
ceived.
letter Seely started for San Francisco
with a big Colt's revolver In his grip and
was accompanied by his nephew, C. W.
Garletz, who came to Oakland yesterday
afternoon and located the home of . Mrs.
Seely, where the tragedy occured.
W. H. Drummond, the woman's brother,
and Sidney Wilson, their friend, and Mrs.
Seely received Garletz. who. according to
Drummond, made no reference to his
uncle's presence in San Francisco. But
the visit disturbed Drummond, as had the
receipt of the letter. He declared to his
sister when the letter came that there
was something wrong, and it was upon
his advice that the little girl was sent, to
friends until there should be some devel
opments.
Drummond places uocn the nephew a
large share of blame for the tragic out
come of the husband's visit last night.
When the distressed brother talked to-day
of the occurrence he dwelt much upon
the circumstances suiroundine Garletz'
visit durlne the afternoon and his return
again In the evening with Seely, who had
armed himself with the revolver.
nearly $100,000.- Mrs. Harris, who was
more than SO years of age when the suit
began, died before the matter came to
trial and the case has since been carried
on by the executor of the will, E. Wilder
Churchill.
In her original complaint Mrs. Harris
alleged that until the discovery of certain
irregularities in her business affairs she
had reposed implicit confidence in her
brother's Judgment and responsibility
and had no knowledge of the con
duct of her business. She stated that
her brother had taken advantage oof
the confidence reposed in him to have
large blocks of securities transferred from
her accounts to his own and had bor
rowed more than $20,000 from her on notes
which she alleged were worthless and
fraudulent.
The first suit was dismissed and a sec
ond one begun in 1S97. In January, 1S39,
Judgment for 161,862 75 was rendered in
the Superior Court in favor of the estate.
The case was Immediately appealed to
the Supreme Court by Ames, who put In.
a counter claim for $25,000 for his services
as Mrs. Harris* agent during her life
time. The case is still pending before the
higher court.
The terms of the compromise as out
lined in the stipulation now agreed to by
both parties to the suit cover all the mat
ters in dispute, except a note for $4470 in
Mrs. Harris' favor, drawn by Ames &
Harris. Mr. Ames agrees to pay $23,000
in cash on or before the 1st of March.
1901, and the remainder by four notes of
$5000 each, payable in one. two, three and
four years, and secured by an equivalent
amount of Ames & Harris Company
stock. . 4
The stipulation will be submitted to
Judge Ellsworth next Wednesday;
*The first suit, filed in 1S96, charged that
J. P. Ames, while acting as his sister's
agent in the purchase and sale of stocks,
and in "the management of real estate,
had defrauded her to the amount of
compromise agreed to by the defendant
and Mrs. Harris' heirs and placed on tile
to-day.
By the terms of the compromise Mr.
Ames is to pay his sister's estate $45,000
and waive all his counter claims against
the estate.

COMPROMISE ENDS
OLD FAMILY FEUD
BERKELEY, Feb. 9.â Hearst Halt,
with its big: gymnasium and la
dies' rooms, formally became a
part of the University of Califor
nia to-day. It will be for many
years to come the daily home of tha
women studentsâ the central scene of
their college life, of their study hoars, or
their pastimes and their sports. It was
dedicated to them this afternoon, the ex
ercises commencing at 3 o'clock.
The university band opened the exer
cises with a selection. President Wheeler
presided. He delivered a short address,
saying in part:
Here there shall be tor thÂ» women students
a home, a place of rescrt and of refugs. Her*
they have the opportunity of a place of asso
ciation with women and a place where they
may secure good health.
Many have declared that college, education
produces supersensltlve women, but we flnA
that everything in the modern education of
women is moving in the right direction. May
this hall be always used in common sense,
sanity and health and may It send out into
the world women of common sense, sanity and
health.
The Choral Society, the women stu
dents' musical organization, rendered a
selection. The members wore their
mortar-boards and gowns and formed ona
of the charming features of the exercises.
Mrs. M. L. Cheney, who graduated from
the university with the class or '83, told
of the past, of the old girls and the old
boys. At that time there was" no Hearst
Hall for the women, no place of social
gathering. In spite of this there were
many pleasant remembrances of the past.
Mrs. Cheney said:
Mrs. Hearst has given you this magnificent
building. She has given you the opportunity
to do much, but after all It lies with you to
make the best of .that opportunity. To show
Mrs. Hearst how much this gift is appreciated
every woman student should make the best
use of It possible.
Miss Muriel Eastman "01 responded,
speaking of the present. She said:
Can there possibly be any new experience,
left for the present? One can not help won
dering this, after hearing this history of ths
past. Doubtless the past was golden, doubt
less it was appreciated as a golden ace by
It* sons and daughters. It Is but natural that
the past glittered like true sro.d. but each aÂ«n
Is In its turn tested by opportunity. If thÂ»
goddess se*s her own fare reflected In It she
knows that the age is true gold. She sees
her face imaged in the gold to-day.
Opportunity means responsibility. Our CeitJ
has grown. Whatever els* a woman may be
ir she Is to live up to her high calling as a
woman she roust be cultured, and she must
get this culture in college If she does not
have it when she enters. Culture mmt color
her feeling for art. for books, tor music, and.
n.ost of all. for character. If she has not
the Instinct foi 1 the fragrant fields of life. an<i
if their fragrance does not cling to her gar
ments, she will have failed as a woman.
We girls are responsible for this atm^sphera
of culture in collegeâ for creating this feelins
for the best that Is thought and kno-wn In
the world. Hearst Hall will help us create
this atmosphere for usâ and only when this Is
so will the goddess see her face in the tru-Â»
goldâ and only then will we have expressed
In fullest measure our appreciation of Mrs.
Hearst's gift to us.
In behalf of Mrs. Hearst, Mrs. Sanborn
of San Francisco delivered the dedicatory
address. She said:
Did you not already know Mrs. Hearst, did
you not already know of her high character.
it might be possible for me to tell you Â»ome
tblng. Now. In her name. I thank you ons
and all for the spirit la which you have re
ceived this rift.
An American flag, hanging in front of
the dedicatory plate, was drawn up by
the president's little son. Benjamin, and
the exercises closed with a prayer by Pro
fessor Thomas R. Bacon and a selection
by a student quartet.
The dedicatory plate was of oak. oblong
In shape, with the following inscription:
Dedicated to the women students of the Uni
versity of California by Pbebe Apperaon
Hearst. IDOL
An informal dance was held after the
dedication and refreshments were served.

LANDSLIDE ON SOUTHERN
PACIPIC COAST ROAD
Ttains May Not Be Running on the
Hew Line for Months to
Come.
SANTA BARBARA. Feb. S.-Loosened
r>y heavy rains a bi& mass of earth slid
nto a deep cut on the Southern Pacific's
)ew line just south of Arroyo Honda yes
erelay. The road at this point makes a
urve with the ocean-iront bluJt and goes
:hrough a cut at the same time. Tna
a/hole formation is Ft.^le and becomes un
stable when saturated. The bluff has
settled and given away below and the
bank on the upper side of the cut has
rolled in, covering 2Â»0 yards of track.
This is not the oniy trouble experienced
along the new line. There has been more
r-r Jess sliding in a number of places south
r.f Gaviotaâ in fact, wherever shale for
mation is encountered in the roadbed.
The company has recognized this and at
the wors-t placeâ the scene of the present
Flide â it has bten working on another cut
which will go nearer the base of the hills
and consequently be much deeper, but
will avoid the edcr of the bluff. It U
fFtimattd that to complete this work will
require thre-e months if the weather be
pood. Trains may uot run on the coast
line for months to ccme.

SETDEN" IS FORCED
TO FILE NEW SUIT
John F. Seyden's petition for a -writ of
Injunction to restrain tne Board of Civil
Service Commissioners from declaring in
eligible for a position in the Tax Collec
tor's office and to restrain Tax Collector
Scott from removing him from his posi
tion at the Instance of the Civil Service
Commission has been dismissed by Judge
Murasky. The merits of the controversy
are consequently as yet undecided.
Judge Murasky, In a brief opinion, holds
that Seyden. who sued in behalf of many
other deputies besides himself, has pur
sued an improper course in an effort to
secure the desired relief. He holds that
a WTlt of injunction will not lie to re
strain the acts complained of, but the
proper course to bring the issues before
the court is by proceedings in mandate.
Upon the filing of the court's order a peti
tion tnr a. writ of mandate was filed in
Seyden's behalf. The case was assigned
to Judge Murasky and an opinion on the
merits of the controversy will now be
forthcoming.

Colonial Governments Of To-Day â Their Strength arid
Their Weakness.
A series of articles, fully illustrated, on the principal colonies
of the world, their rulers and their forms of government. This
series is under the general direction of â¢
PROFESSOR JOHN H. FINLEY
Of Princeton University* Ex-PrcsÂ«dent of Knox
College and Former Editor o? Harper's Weekly,
Who is an expert on the governmental needs of the new colonies
of the United States, and who has visited Porto Rico especially
to study those needs. The articles themselves, with the exception
of a final article by PROFESSOR FINLEY, summing up the
questions of colonial government as they relate to the new colo-
nies of the United States, are written by persons having intimate
personal knowledge of foreign colonial governments. Material
for these articles has been specially collected -in London, Paris,
The Hague, Berlin, Lisbon, Tokio, Calcutta, Sumatra, Java,
Madagascar, Portuguese East Africa and elsewhere abroad.
Among the early articles of the series are the following:
"MAURITIUSâ A HERITAGE OF CONQUEST," *
colony of very romantic history, by Edgcurhb
Staley, M. A., of London, England, author of
*'The Arms and Badges of the British Colonies."
"ZANZIBARâ A WARD OF COURT," by Walter
Hodgson, M. A., of Keble College, Oxford.
"THE EMPIRE OF INDIA," by Edgcumbe Staley,
M. A.
"THE FIJI ISLANDS," by Morgan I. Finucane,
IVl. R. C. S. E., medical director of the colony.
"WHY GREAT BRITAIN SUCCEEDS AS A COL-
ONIZER," by Alfred Stead of London, England,
Walter Hodgson, M. A.
fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute.
"CEYLONâ THE FIRST CROWN COLONY,", by
Other articles will deal with Dutch, Portuguese, German,
French, Japanese and British colonial methods, as shown in Java,
Sumatra, South Africa, East Africa, Egypt, Madagascar, Borneo,
Formosa and elsewhere. A particularly interesting article will tell
how the government of New Zealand, after years of warfare
against the unconquerable Maoris, turned them into peaceable
citizens, with native representatives in the colonial Parliament.
The story of the long wars of the Dutch, which are still in prog T
* ress, in their great island possessions in the East Indies, will also
be told. The illustrations of this series will be notable.

The Opportunity and the Man.
Illustrated by unique biographies of remarkable men or to-
day. Edited by PRESIDENT DRAPER of the University of
Illinois. The series to be concluded with an article by the
HON. GEORGE F. HOAR, Â§ff|||Â§||
Concerning American opportunities and the homely virtues which
combine with them to produce success. '. 1
This series is intended to be as helpful to the young man-
hood of the nation as it will be interesting to all classes of read-
ers. To illustrate American traits by "human documents" highly
interesting in themselves and collectively running the gamut of
modern effort and of American character is a novel idea, which
makes a feature of very unusual interest. Careful selection from
all parts of the United States has secured a remarkable list of
men whose lives throw into strong light the various lines of effort
which go to make up some of the great industries of the nation.
Among them are EDWIN REYNOLDS, the machinery expert
of the E. P. ALLIS Company of Milwaukee; WILLIAM B.
RAXKIN, the electrical expert, who succeeded in "harnessing"
Niagara Falls; TIMOTHY KINNEY, the "sheep king" of
Wyoming, who is said to own more sheep than any one else on
earth; FLOYD DAY, the mountain financier of Kentucky,
owner of many mountain stores: W. W. DUSON, the "rice
king" of Louisiana; J. H. HALE, "king of peach-growers";
HUGH CHISHOLM. the paper manufacturer of Maine; F. A.
HEINZE. the "copper king" of Buttc, Mont.; R. S. BROOK-
IXGS. millionaire merchant of St. Louis; W. S. STRATTON
of Independence mine fame, Colorado; CORTHELL, the fa-
mous engineer: BARBER of match fame; DUEBER, the erreat
watch manufacturer; WILCOX, the prominent miller of Port-
land. Ore.; CRAMP, the ship builder, etc.. etc.
Every one of these articles will read like a first-class story,
replete with picturesque incidents, etc. All have been prepared
by brilliant writers, having an intimate acquaintance in each in-
stance with the men whose careers are delineated.

All of the papers, taken together, will give vivid impressions
of the Americans of 1801 and the century they lived in.
American Life a Century Ago.
A series of articles by two of the best known women writers
of the United Statesâ ALICE MORSE EARLE of New York,
author of "The Sabbath in Puritan 'New England," "China Col-
lecting in America," "Costumes of Colonial Times," "Colonial Days
in Old New York," "Old-Time â¢ Drinks and Drinkers," "Home
Life in Colonial Days," "Stage Coach and Tavern Days," and^ther
similar works, and MARY HARTWELL CATHERWOOD of
Illinois, author of "The Romance of Dollard," "The Story of
Tonty," "Old Kaskaskia," "The White Islander," "The Spirit of
an Illinois Town," "The Days of Jeanne d'Arc," and other de-
lightful stories. The series will also embrace two or three articles
by other pens; notably one by D. D. THOMPSON, editor of the
Northwestern Christian Advocate, on "The Pioneer Circuit Rider.
and the Old-Time Camp Meeting." MR. MAURICE THOMP-
SON, author of "Alice of Old Vincennes" and other popular
books, has arranged to contribute to the series, but his serious ill-
ness is nearly certain to prevent him from contributing. His place
willbe filled by able writers.
Among the articles to be written by Mrs. Earle are the fol-
. lowing: }f.?:.
"MEN'S COSTUME A CENTURY AGO."
"WOMEN'S COSTUME A CENTURY AGO."
"TABLE FURNISHINGS A CENTURY AGO."
"STORY OF AMERICAN DESIGNS ON OLD ENGLISH
. POTTERY." â¢
"STREET SCENES AND CITY LIFE A CENTURY AGO."
"THE GREAT TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT AND
DRINKING HABITS AT THE DAWN OF THE CEN-
1 TURY."
Mrs. Catherwood's articles will deal mainly witn phases of
home life in the early cities and pioneer homes of the West at the
beginning of the century. The illustrations for these articles have
been obtained from rare sources. MRS. EARLE has supplied
many of them, and sheWays of her pictures:

needs. It will not be excelled for con
venience and appointments in this city.
Last Wednesday thirty members of this

President Nicholson was the toastmaater,
and a good one he made.

who has proved himself a very active man
In the matter of securing new member*.
He already has a large number to his
credit. During the past week twenty-flvo
strangers were Initiated, and there are
still "a few left." who will be taught tha
mysteries of the order In the near futura.
A body of sir knlght3 from San Francis
co Tent visited Pacific Tent on the occa
sion of its last held review, and they were
most cordially welcomed. Captain Seeley
of San Francisco's degree team accepted
the challenge of the degree team of tha

Ancient Order United "Workmen.
Last week District Deputies Cunning
ham, Blackman, Hansen, Lawton,
Knowles and Stock and Special Deputies
Malloy and Hawley, together with Grand
Recorder Spencer, were the guests at a
dinner by Grand Master Snook, who took
that method to express his satisfaction
with the work that these gentlemen have
done since he has been ln office. Unfor
tunately the grand master could not act
as host, as he was detained that night in
San Jose in a law case, but in his stead
Deputy Grand Master Edwin Danforth
presided. After the dinner there was an
informal discussion of matters connected
with the order and a great deal of valu
able information was brought out. which
will be made available for the advance
ment of the order. During the evening
the deputy grand master announced that
he will not be an aspirant for the office
he has filled for several terms. It also was
suggested that something ought to be
done to entertain the representatives to
the Grand Lodge at the next session. It
was decided to discuss that matter at a
session of the extension committee. Tha
reunion was a most pleasant one.
At a meeting of the San Francisco ex
tension committee held on the night of
the 2d Inst. there was a large representa
tion present, and reports from the various
lodges showed considerable activity ln the
line of extending the limits of the order.
Reports presented showed, that the order
will go before the next Grand Lodge with
a greater gain than was shown at tne pre
vious session. There was appointed a spe
cial committee to submit plans for an en
tertainment fcr the representatives to tha
Grand Lodge and the gTand officers dur
ing the next session. The plans will bÂ«
discussed at another meeting, and If either
is adopted an effort 'will be made to carry
it out to a successful issue.

form, after which the lodge closed and
there was a programme of entertainment
that included a buck and wing dance by
H Douglass, fancy dance by Professor
Martin and Rosalie Lloyd, sailors' horn-

Daniels. David Keefe and Captain R. H.
McPherson Its representatives to the

An evidence of the systematic manner
In which the work la done ln the office
of the recorder of the Grand Lodge is
apparent In the fact that when Grand Re
corder Spencer visited the Supreme Lodga
relief committee a few weeks since to
make a demand for $93,000 relief, he pre
sented 360 death proofs and all were . found
to be correct in every particular, not ona
needing correction. - ;. ?!?â?â¢* <n

CHICAGO. Feb. 9.â The bearish sentiment of
the wheat crowd manifested Itself at the open

somewhat skeptical over recently reported ex

Joyed by the v.heat belt, conditions which have
obtained for some da.ys. as well as to needless
confirmation of reports that half of. the Min
neapolis flour capacity will fall Into temporary
disuse Monday. The fact was ignored that Liv

was going on on a liberal scale, especially In
the high-grade railroad stocks under cover of
the upward movement In some of the very low
rrlced stocks in both -the railroad and In
dustrial lists. Among the candidates for favor
in this department were Standard Rope, Leath
er, Mexican National and some other stocks
of a similar grade, which showed much
strength. Advances In Sugar, Tobacco and
General Electric also helped to sustain the
market. Atchison was Iirm all day and in the
last five minutes was suddenly run up to iS%i
at the same time that Union Pacific preferred
waa sold down sharply to S7. Chicago and
Eastern Illinois was pushed up 6>,4. but re
acted 24. and Louisville and Missouri Pacific
were rather firm. The steel stocks moved
rather narrowly and were lrreR-ular. Specu
lators In those stocks seemed disposed to await
the expected authorised announcement of the
plan for adjustment of conditions in the steel
trade before making further commitments. The
bank statement brought pome further selling
upon the market, but vigorous support was
forthcoming and no further Eerious Inroads
were made upon prices. The further Urge im
pairment of reserves disclosed by the bank
statement and the probability that the steel
, deal is yet to be provided for undoubtedly
somewhat chilled speculative enthusiasm. Hut
the bears were manifestly timid about attack
ing the market in view of the important pos
sibilities of further great financial projects.
Wall street ha* been all week in the throes
of excitement over prodigious financial projects,
contemplating such vast consolidations of prop
erty as have never been known. When the
market opened en Monday it was the first op
portunity for the rffeit on public sentiment
cf the Union Paciflo-Â»outhern Pacific deal to
manifest Hj"?lf. aa Its consummation had not
been formally announced until Friday after
noon after the close of the market and uf>or.
thÂ«Â» eve of the Saturday holiday. Information
of the negotiations in project for the gigantic
combination of the steel corporation has also
become public property during the week.
Speculative sentiment has been dazzled by the
financial potentialities thus shown and trading
In the stock market hat. again run up to near
the high record cf activity. The extent of
the price movements iias also been extraord
inary, as Is but natural when the abnormal
proportion* of the dealings Is considered.
Where speculators are dealing in one thousand'
to ten thousand share lots, as they have been
doing- this week, much greater changes In
prices are bound to occur than where the nor
mal unit of one hundred share lots Is adhered
to. ThÂ« highly speculative character of the
market is shown by tne feverish and erratic
character of the price movement. Professional
operators a.re well awitre that speculation In
variably overruns ltaelf in such a headlonjf
and reckless market aÂ« that now prevailing
and they have been quick to avail themselves
of opportunities to takÂ» profits. This has been
true not only of the bulls but of the bears
also, so that the occasional bulge In prices
have generally given away before the heavy
offerings encountered, while the sudden dips
which have at times occurred have been fol
lowed by violent recoveries. The purely specu
lative class of operators are not distinguished
for close analysis of values. If they can at
tract a large following which will Join ttiem
in buying or in celling stocks until a condition
in prices has been paused which offers them
a profit their object fs attained. But the scope
of the financial projects now in contemplation
tÂ» Â»o vast as to stasi;er the Judgment even
of the large proprietors themselves as to the
measure of their effect. Bankers who are
asked to take part In financing some of the
deals confess themselves puzzled as to the
effects to ensue on the value of the securities,
on the money market and on the financial situ
ation at large. The |,roblem is really one of
world-wide conditions and applications. The
speculative markets will solve it In time, but
they will solve lt in lÂ»ie usual way. That Is
to say the first x-iolent fluctuations will carry
price? far from normal intrinsic .values and it
can only be by succe-sslve oscillations of de->
creasing violence that the price pendulum can
SLgaln be brought back to near intrinsic values.
The cessation of the gold export movement and
the marked relaxation In foreign money con
ditions have removed the' apprehension of a
possible drain upon our money market on that
score. It is claimed that the money market
is safe from the danger of disturbance from
the projected steel combination, as .such trans
actions are achieved largely through exchange
of old securities for new. .*
The railroad bond market nan been -a^mm
unpreceder.tly active ar.d prices have advanced
more steadily than those of stocks. Low-grade
speculative or semi-speculative bonds have been
'ii largest demand.

NEW YORK. Feb. 9.â ThÂ» Financier says:
Th*! totals of the New York clearing housn
banks continue to expand at'a rate never be
; fore equaled. Loans for the week ending Feb
, ruary 9 Increased $23,481,200. making a gain of
| more than $<sl,000.00<> since January 15 last. This
! onormous accession to loan commitments seems
i larger than called for, even. taking into con
sideration the amounts required to finance the
varloua railroad deals, which have been pend
ing over the month and it is to be inferred
that an appreciable amount of the borrowing
has been in the nature of a sterling exchange
operation and stock market requirements, the
latter owing to the revival In activity noted
of late, having been exceedingly -heavy. The
surprising feature of the statement Is the
small gain In the cash. The total Increase In
specie and legals was $1,695,900. which is con
sidered less .than half the amount calculated
earlier in the week. It Is true that the flow
of money to this center from the Interior Is
diminishing and operations at the Sub-Treasury
resulted In a loss to the banks. The Treasury
was a creditor at the clearing house Saturday
for over two million dollars, . which was paid
over in one check on account of the Union
Pacific settlement with the Government. This
Â¦ will figure in full in next week's bank state
ment and to that extent wjll operate against
cash increases by the banks. The gain In de
posits amounting to $24,676,400 Is due almost
entirely to the loan expansion, and as It called
for an addition reserve requirement of more
than $6,OGO,(iOO. the surplus reserve was de
creasod by. that amount, less the gain In cash
holdings, leas $4,476,200. This lowers the total
excess to $20,362,625. but this figure, despite the
rise In deposit liabilities In nearly one hundred
and twenty-four millions in a month, is six
millions heavier than at the beginning of last
month. The banks, therefore, are stronger In
surplus reserve than was the case four or five
weeks ago, a . remarkable fact considering the
; burden of accommodation to which they have
been subjected.
Viewed in any. light, the â¢ current exhibit
makes for a firmer feeling In the market, al
though this does not necessarily mean higher
rates at once. The announcement Â¦ of several
railroad bond Issues and, pendlng,steel deal will
i make the statement for the next several weeks
an Interesting study. There seems to be no
doubt now that deposits before that 'time will
rise above the thousand million mark now
nearly reached. Th/? trust company totals If
available, would probably show a proportion
ate expansion, due to causes already noted.

J. TT. Campbell, the man under arrest
cn suspicion of having thrown M. H. Guy
ever the banisters at ElaVj Bush street
lest Thursday morning, told a very
straight story at the inquest yesterday.
It was to the effect that he and Guy had
ouarrok-d about 5 o'clock in the morning
cbout T2Z> that had been stolen from
Campbell's room. Both men were in their
r.ijrht dresses, and when they clinched
ihey fell over the banister to the floor
3ow, a cllstance of fifteen feet, Camp5>ell
landing on top. Three of Guy's ribs were
broken, and Campbell received a black
eye and several pevere brulsea.
The jury returned a verdict of accident
B.nd exonerated Campbell from blame.
A communication was read from Chap

ln^ one instance they credited him with
three tons more than he supplied, while
en -another occasion he was eighteen tons
Fhort- Ap-uirre txlieves that the scales are
correct, and thinks the variance in weight
was caused by mistakes made by the coal
shippers. Every load of coal is weighed
as it is liroupht into the prison, and in

The directors will meet at Folsom on

SAN QUENTIN
Superintendent of Schools Webster yes
terday issued a dignified reply to the bit
ter attack made upon him in his absence
at the last meeting of the Board of Edu
cation by Director Casserly. The state-,
xne'nt was prepared by Webster in order
to correct certain remarks attributed to
him In a published interview. Mr. Web
ster denies that he specifically mentioned
the name of Mr. Casserly in connection
with the hiring of a hacK, which caused
Casserly to tly into a passion. Webster
says that what he did say in an Interview
Is in substance as follows:
The male members of thÂ«? Board of Educa
tion had inEulted me and endeavored to humili
ate mÂ» by their conduct In refusing and nes
lectinK. alter repeated and urgent requests, set
ting lorth thfir necessity, to furnish the office
ot the Superintendent with articles of furni
ture and conveniences necessary for the proper
transaction of business. Mr. Casserly, having
charge of the supply department, nearly nix
months ago was furnished with my requisition
for articles of furniture, and on three occa
sions when his attention was directed to these
necessities, and he was invited by me to come
to the olnces and investigate for himself, he
replied he would come to the office and look
into the matter "at his convenience" or "when
it was convenient"; but he never did come.
On November 14, 1900, Mr. Donman, having
assumed charge of supplies, these requisitions
were presented to him. but he put me off with
out any good cause until directed by Mrs. Kin
caid "to sign," which was done on the 23d day
of January. A year ago, when making urgent
requisition. I was treated in like manner a.id
then secured what was necessary through the
intercession of Mrx. Kir.caid. The great bulk
of all furniture and conveniences granted to
my offices has been secured through the gen
erosity, courtesy and influence of Mrs. Kln
ccid. without which it is safe to say it never
would have been received.
I did say that the Board of Education were
net allowed traveling expenses by law; that
two demands, however, for livery were con
tracted by the board in visiting schools during
two days In the last of April. 1900: that I had
refused to approve and eigrn these demands and
that Mr. Mark declared that it was very email
on my part not to Eign them. I did not men
tion the name of Mr. Casserly in connection
with the contraction of these bills, but it is
cafe to Jnfer that Mr. Casserly has just as
much to 'do with the contraction of such bills
as any other member of the board, and that I
had been informed that the members of the
board paid, for the bills out of their own
pockets.
I have be**n Informed through the public
print that Mr. Casserly haÂ« denounced the
statements made by me In the above mentioned
Interview and at other times respecting his
official conduct and that of the other members
of the board as "malicious lies" and has seri
ously entertained the notion of doinÂ«; me per
1 ponal violence. I here take occasion to nay
that If he has thus denounced my statements
as malicious lies I pass this delicate and re
fined compliment (?). which is an evidence of
his aristocratic breeding, back to him with the
suggestion that he consider well the question
of the propriety of a man of his extensive pro
portions undertaking to browbeat me with
threats, for really It would be exceedingly dis
tasteful to me to be subjected to personal
violence by anybody, and especially by him.

THE SAN FRANCISCO; CALL; SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1901-
The Colfax, Placer County. Sentinel has
a communication from Harold T. Power
on the future of drift mining in Placer
County. Power says that the deep placers
of Placer and Calaveras counties probably
contain more gold than California has yet
produced; and a large percentage will be
profitably recovered. He predicts that
be getting its affairs into" shape to work
in Shasta, County. Plans are reported to
have been adopted for a 750-ton smelter, a
converter, nine miles of railroad to con
nect the mines with the Southern Pacific
Company's lines and also the purchase of
railroad rolling stock and equipment.- the
installation of a hydraulic plant and- the
purchase of a fluxing ' outfit. The entire
plant is expected to be in operation by the
1st of August.
The mineral . claimants to lands in the
Douglasville placer claim. In Tuolumne
County, have been sustained by a deci
sion of the Secretary of the Interior, who
finds the lands are mineral. .The claim
is situated .by the - county road between
Browns- Flat' and Columbia, at* a plac*
commonly called ' Douglasville. The land
v/as once found by a receiver of the Land
Office to be agricultural, but .the hearing
was carried up to the Secretary of the In
terior. In his decision: the Secretary finds
that prior to. the last placer location ( the
lands included in the claim yielded about
5S500 per month for a. period of two years
and that under the * present location It
has produced something -> like $18,000 â¢ in
gold.' During the month previous to -the
hearing before ' the : Secretary , the mineral
claimant took out a $125 piece from virgin
ground. -It, was incumbent upon the agri
cultural claimant.: as the Secretary held
to show" tttat its cmlneral character had
been worked out before he could establish
his claim. Â¦Â¦ .- Â¦ ,.. ,; v.. ... . - .*.â ;
â¢pThe Trinity Copper .Company appears to
The somewhat famqus case of the Key
stone Consolidated Mining 'Company
against ' the South Spring, Hill Mining
Company. has been dismissed , by the Su
perior. Court of Calaveras County for lack
of prosecution. The claim set up by the
plaintiff company was that the defendant
company entered upon -its ground by
means; of Its underground works and took
from veins that have their apexes within
the lines of the plaintiff's surface location,
bullion of the value of $2,000,000. The case
has been pending since 1S90. The court
held - that ; there . was a lack of due dili
gence. â .....Â¦Â¦..-;
Mines having a gross output of bullion
of less than $:'i000 per annum are exempt
from the bullion tax. /The Yuma Sun.
which publishes the text of the bill and
comments on it at length, 'says It will not
be surprising if some bullion tax bill, not
radical nor aimed to work hardship, shall
be made a law. Â¦Â¦',
. Section 7. It shall be the duty of the Asses
sor to l prepare a tax list or assessment roll
alphabetically arranged In the book or books
which shall be furnished him by the Board of
Supervisors for that purpose, . lri which book or
books he shall list all mines or mining claims
in his county, together with the gross output
of the number of tons of ores, tailings, borax
or. soda or other mineral bearing material of
whatever character, the total value In dollars
and cents, the actual cost of extracting said
ores or mlnerula from said mines, the actual
cost of Bavins said tailings, the actual cosÂ»t
of transportation . to places of reduction or
sale a!id the actual cost of reduction or eal<i
and tlve. actual net proceeds, which ' list or
assessment roll he shall deliver to the clerk
of the Board of Supervisors at the same time
and the same manner as is now provided oy
law for > making returns of real estato . and
other taxable property in the Territory of Ari
zona. ! : - ' - .
While, the California Legislature, is
struggling with problems having direct
relation to mining, it will Interest miners
to learn of the legislation which is being
attempted elsewhere. The Territorial
Legislature [ of Arizona, for Instance, is
once more considering the bullion tax. A
bill was "introduced by Assemblyman
Peterson of Maricopa which has for its
principal provisions the following in sub
stance: All the proceeds of mines shall be
assessed annually for "Territorial and
county purposes, the tax to be assessed
on the net value of the ores, tailings,
bcrax, soda or mineral bearing material
of any character at the same, rate that
other property is taxed, but , all ma
chinery, hoisting works and improvements
are exempted from taxation under the
act; every tax levied is made a Hen upon
the mines or mining claims, which shall
not be removed until the taxes are paid or
tho title is vested in a purchaser in a sale
for the taxes; the County Assessor of
each county must ascertain annually the
number of tons 'and value per ton of all
quartz, ores, minerals or tailings ex
tracted for sale or reduction from tho
mines, and shall assess them and collect
the taxes: any person giving false in
formation to the Assessor concerning
mining properties shall be deemed guilty
of perjury and punished accordingly.
From these provisions it will appear that
a prospect of lively work is mapped out
for the County Asessors if the measure
carries. The seventh section of the bill
confirms this impression,, it being* as fol
lows: ,
drift mining will be carried on more ex
tensively In the future.
R. A. Thomas, who represents a syndi
cate of Los Angeles men who have In
vested in copper properties in Arizona, re
ports there is great activity in the JctÂ«*e&
section. Twenty companies besldes~Tna
great United Verde are working near Je
rome. The United Verde Company Is em
ploying from 1200 to 1500 men. Since 1895
the copper production of Arizona has risen
from- 47.000.000 pounds to 122,000,000 pounds,
the last figures being for the year ISM.
This is equal to the frier ease In the Lako
Michigan region and Montana also.
The smelter trust, so says tho Monterey,
Mexico. Dally News, is making steady
progress In acquiring the great smelting
properties of Mexico.
At the close of the meeting a-communi
cation from the North End Improvement
Club was read, requesting that larger fire
mains be laid In tho commercial section.
This was supplemented by a report from
Chief Sullivan that the water supply Jn
the section referred, to would-be .'totally
Inadequate in case of a big conflagration.
The club made a request' that -the. water
company.- be, given a.Â« bounteous . rate, that
If might make the necessary improve
ments.. The matter will be taken up later.
Schussier then. recommended leaving the
settlement of the rates to the : Board of
Public Works. Supervisor Brandensteln
asked the witness if he would be satisfied
to abide by the board's decision. Schuss
ier replied that he would unless the board
committed some grievous error, where
upon the Supervisor took occasion, to re
mark that the company would be satisfied
unless it was dissatisfied, and caused a
laugh. â¢ Schussier claimed that a deficit
amounting to $29,000 had occurred .last
year owing to the board's reduction, and
mentioned the slight rainfall, of tne last
few years as an additional . cause for the
expenditure of large sums of monuy. He
paid that while farmers had been amply
supplied with Â«vater Â¦ yet the . fall had I not
been sufficient for surface reservoirs.-
"In those days," Schussier said, . "the
people were fair and. square. Now they
seem only eager for a chance to jump on
associated capital. The Spring Valley
Water Company has been i the horse . on
which many a man has ridden into, of
fice. Of course, I don't refer to any one
in this room. When men take office their
motives may I bÂ» pure enough; but they
seem to 'think that the only way they
can please the people Is by immediately
beginning to hack at water rates. Each
year our investments are Jeopardized be
cause people feel timid about purchasing,
thinking that profits will be reduced by
the. board. Our stock would be at par or
above It to-day If it was^not for this."
Reed first Introduced a report compiled
by the merchants of New York City, in
which the cost of water to that municipal
ity is quoted at much less than the figure
stated by the Spring Valley Company.
The question of the latter water corpora
tion's source of revenue was discussed at
length, and considerable argument arose
over the fact that the difference in the
par value of the stock and a' sunv com
mensurate with the money realized on it
was several million dollars. Schussier ob
jected to the insinuation that the stock
had been watered, and said that the dif
ference might be accounted for because
of money invested In the early history of
the company that had netted Its owners
no Interest, the returns having been used
In new construction.
It developed In the course of the inquiry
that prosperity has smiled on San Fran
cisco during the last year. The water
company's records show that a year ago
there were nearly 4500 vacant houses in
the city, while to-day there are about 2J00.
In addition to this many new structures
have been erected, a number of them ten
ement houses. The company's books show
that 2000 more families are using water
to-day than at a corresponding date last
year. . Â¦ Â¦
Little of Importance was elicited at the
Investigation conducted by the Board of
Supervisor* with a view of fixing water
rates for the ensuing year, which was re
sumed ye&terday. H. Schussier, the chief
engineer lor the Spring Valley Company,
was on the stand, and during the first
part of the proceedings quizzed by
Supervisor Reed. There were frequent dif
ferences cf opinion between* witness and
inquisitor and some word passages, hu
morous and otherwise, which often caused
the chairman to rap for order. -

The Judge thought the evidence, did not
Justify him in sending the boy to the
State prison, but he should rather be
given * the" opportunity of behaving, him
self. As a motion had been made to con
tinue the case, he would do so from month
to month till' the boy was 21 years of age,
but if he should commit any offense In the
meantime he would be. taken into custody
and sentence would be pronounced against
him on ' the original charge. .The boy
would be ' released on ; his t own recogniz
ance, but he would" have to report to the
court every month. < 'Â¦Â¦Â¦>
David S. Hirshbere 1 was recalled," and
eald that the boy could be given into the
care of his parents with perfect safety
and it would be a Just and proper thing
to do. To send him to the State prison
would, be utter ruination. â¢During^the
three years he had been superintendent he
had- only recommitted five boys.
- Attorney ?Fred Frye; who had:'spent' a
month at the school, gave the i boy a good
character.! - : . â¢ ,
Captain A. J. Wood of Company A, of
which Bernstein was a member, testified
that the boy could not keep out of trou
ble. , He was always talking about every
one having it "In for him." The boy's
manner to the officials' was insolent. He
had not flogged the boy, as stated in a
newspaper, because he was suppocted of
setting fire to the Administration build
ing. *. The flogging was done by A. J.
Heelh. tke tailor.
A subflfena had been issued for Heeth,
but a return was made that he could not
be found, as he had gone to Los Angeles. â¢
For the boy, Mrs. Louise > Hirshberg,
wife of the former superintendent, testi
fied that she had found him always smart
ing under a sense of injustice and want
ing a "square deal." She thought the boy
was Quite fitted to go out.in to the world
and that he would make" an upright man.
He should have been released long ago.
A boy whom the officers considered I the
worst boy at the school was now making
a success in the .world, which; showed
that officers were often unjust' in- their
opinions: . . â¢ Â¦ -. /. . ': -
J Dr. C. B. Riddick, the present superin
tendent of the school, testified in effect
that he had never-seen a more incorrigi
ble boy and that he was totally depraved.
He had only been six weeks superintend
ent of the school, and he gathered the
facts on which to base, his opinion chiefly
from the "history book." which showed
the times he had been flogged and the
causes during his- successor's term of of
fice. He had ordered four boys recom
mitted since becoming superintendent and
there were others. In answer to the
Judge, he- eald the boy, ought not to be
sent'to a reform school, but to the State
prison. That was his deliberate opinion.
The. examination Into the chargres made
by the officials of the Preston School of
Industry at lone against Benjamin Bern
stein that he was incorrigible' and a de
generate was concluded by Superior Judge
Cool* yesterday morning. The boy retort
ed that he had been flogged and slapped
in the face" In an effort to force him to
confess that he had set lire to a building,
although he was innocent.
Judge Cook Orders Him In
to the Custody of"
His Parents.
