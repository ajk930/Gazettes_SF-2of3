CHICAGO, Feb. 5.â Eugene I. Gowell,
who says he is the famous Charley Ross,
walked into detective headquarters early
and requested the police to look up his
family tree. Gowell, who*has been travel
ing about the country and is now living
In Chicago at 77 Sangamon street, says
he has dim recollections of living In dif
ferent and more comfortable surroundings
in a house by the side of a little brook.
As to the circumstance surrounding his
birth or the ' kidnaping episode, Gowell
knows nothing, but accounts for this by
explaining he was'drugged* at the" time
and the drug had left his mind a blank.
Twenty-four years ago, he says, he lived
with Mrs. Clara Itobblns In Los Angeles,
who he was led to believe was his mother.
EUGENE GOWELL CLAIMS
THAT HE IS CHARLEY ROSS
She married William or John Gowell, he
says. They are now living in Los Ange
les. The man said he has. been Informed
by his brother Clarence that he was the
adopted son of Mrs. Gowell.' Some years
ago he left the Gowell home in Los Ange
les and since then he says he has traveled
about the country. Recently, he said, he
made known his claims at Logansport,
Ind., and was placed in ah insane asylum.
Since then he has hesitated in relating the
circumstances. The police 4 are not inclined
to take Gowell's claims seriously.

of $1500 in "the Senate," the finest equip
ped joint In Topekal Sheldld more, for
she gained the first police protection given
her since she started out on. her saloon
smashing career at Wichita a month ago.
The police followed up her "raid of to-day |
and arrested the proprietor, of '.'the Sen
ate" and two men who were guarding the
place.- Mrs. Nation was arrested, ." but
promptly released. * "
" Mrs. Nation arid her wreckers, armed
with hatchets, sallied fqrth at, daybreak
and causht the Jolntist napping. They
forced their way past a negro who guard
ed the door and in less than ten minutes
had strewn the floor with broken*Tnlrrors,
bottles, slot machines and splintered bar
fixtures. The negro fired a shot of warn
ing into the celling, but It had no effect.
Presently a policeman stalked leisurely
into the room and said:
"Well. Sister Nation, I guess we will
have to arpest you again.'.'
Mrs. Nation had Just smashed the last
bottle nr.d was ready to go.
."All right," she responded cheerily;
"you Just came when I wanted you to."
She turned -back when she reached the
door; and inquired, "Everything cleaned
up; ladles?"
The Police Judge Â¦was glad to release
her when she appeared for trial, and after
administering a tongue lashing to' that of
ficial Mrs.; Nation soon walked- proudly
down ; Kansas avenue, free again to smash
and preach.
Michael Wagner, supposed to be, the
owner of "the | Senate," j made the best of
his opportunity \ and promptly secured a
quantity of liquor to supply the thirst of
the crowds; that poured into his place to
view the wreckage that, the Natlonltes
had wrouzh't. '.' ' . ?-.":
During the afternoon two deputies from
Sheriff Cooke's office raided the place and
arrested "Wagner, Shep I Little j and two
guards and took charge of; the stock of
liquors. Warrants ; had been sworn out
only for Wagner and Little, but one of
thedeputies was so angry -when a guard
struck him that he. arrested both guards.
After Mre. Nation had wrecked the Joint
this morning, the porter, who made an
Ineffectual attempt , to hold the place
against the smashers, ran for help. Soon
the chief proprietor, "Shep" Little, was
found and the Joint was opened for busi
ness. People who had heard of the smash
commencedto drop Into the Joint, just to
see the wreck. In a short tirhe the crowd
had become so large" that It required four
bartenders to wait on them. By 9 o'clock
the crowd numbered nearly 200, and from
then until 1 the police , raided the ; place it
fluctuated Â¦ between â¢ 200 and . 250. Among
those present were advocates of temper
ance; who* wished to, see the work of the
crusaders. " The crowd around the. bar de
manded .souvenirs,; and the' bartenders
gathered up bits of glass from the broken
mirror, glvingraway s a small , piece with
every glass of beer. A man stationed him
self at" the front door and cried, "Souve

; Then Judge Magraw began to read the
law touching offenders who create a pub
lic disturbance or cause riot. Mrs.- Nation
interrupted the reading several times.
â¢The prisoner again demanded that tha
City Attorney be brought in and be.com
pelled to give cause, for arresting her yes

her, and the Chief ct Police refused to

"I plead guilty to that," said Mrs. Na

it." ; :''V : '- - '^
' "There Is another charge against you,
Mrs. Nationâ a charge of smashing a

Mrs. Nation demanded to know who had
been the charger and when told that the
City Attorney was responsible for that
said: "Then I want to seÂ« that City At

To-day Mrs. Nation dictated an appeal

There is a great deal of talk of plots
to hurt Mrs. Nation. It was learned to

the house with glass bottles with tremen
dous pressure, so that an explosion will
follow upon being broken. She is not at
all disturbed by these stories..
1 "I do' not care if Mrs. Nation smashes
every "joint in Topeka. I sympathize with
her. I hope she will close up the saloons
of the city. As an officer of the law,
though. It is rriy duty to arrest her every
time she creates a disturbance or destroys
property. If we had the right kind of
State officials it would not be necessary
for Mrs. Nation to do what she 13 doing."

TOPEKA. Kans.. Feb. 5.â The success

AGAINST METHODS USED.
SACRAMENTO, : Feb. 5.â The man - ar
rested at Seattle' cannot be Robinette, the
printer, for, hie is dead. The prisoner ia
probably the Robinette who was employed
Beveral . years ago as , a' clerk at \ the Sut
ter Club. He got into some trouble with
the club, and "left town three * t or; â¢ four
years ago.' His . name was Allen Â¦ Robin
ette.' He did not work in a printing office
and ; never worked for the Record-Union. '
Not Robinette, the Printer.
Robinette .claims that he is the father
of the child. "., The police doubt the truth
of this i claim.? /
Detective Powers and Captain Willard
attempted to get from Robinette the.ad
mission that no harm had befallen the
little one, but he insisted that such was
hot the case and entered his cell repeating
the words: "I killed It: I killed itV;; Â¦
"Yes. the child is dead; I killed it, as I
said I would do. I will not tell where it
is, but her mother will never see her face
again."
Robinette was plainly under the Influ
ence of liquor and soon became very volu
ble. In answer, to a auestlon by the offi
cer he stated that yoaterday afternoon ho
found that Mrs. Colburn had married
Colburn and that he had made good his
threat to do away with her child".
"What did you do : with It?" asked the
officers.
"Killed it." he answered. Hesitating a
moment Robinette finally continued:.
Colburn had no sooner pointed the man
out to Crane than Robinette, seeing his
rival, reached for his revolve*. Crane
sprang upon him and wrenched the pistol
from his hand, and rang for the police
patrol wagon. Roblnetto was taken to
Captain Wilkard's office, where Jailor
Corning attempted to search him. He re
sisted, and it- became necessary to use
force. Ah examination of his pockets re
vealed, besides the revolver, a vicious
looking razor, carried in an upper vest
pocket.
Officer Crane. was detailed on the case,
and together he and Colburn began a sys
tematic search of the city to locate Rob
inette. After several hours, during which
time they called at Roblnette's room at
the Vendome Hotel, they finally located
Robinette in the DIHer bar on First ave
nue.
Mrs. Colburn immediately placed the
note in her husband's hands and he in
tiyn reported the affair at police head
quarters. â¢
Colburn came to this city yesterday and
proceeded to the County Recorder's of
fice, where he obtained a license to marry
Mrs. Kavanaugh, and they were shortly
afterward made man and wife by a local
minister. Little suspecting what awaited
them, the newly wedded couple returned
to their lodgings. Mrs. Colburn found a
letter writen in lead pencil and sighed by
Robinette, in which he told her he had
abducted the child and warned her that
she would never see Its face again unless
she came to him in person and without
the entanglements of a husband. It was
broadly Intimated that the child 'would
suffer should the warning be Ignored.
Recently Robinette came to this city to
live. Not long since he claims to have
become apprised of the fact that A. 'D.'
Colburn, a mechanic, , who resides ln.Sno
hcmlsh, was a suitor for the woman's
hand.
According to the story of Robinette,* who
formerly conducted a hotel In Everett, he
met Mrs. Colburn over four years ago
and they lived together for a considera
ble leneth of time.
The principals in the affair/ are Robi
nette, ' Mrs.^ Clara Â«. Colburn (nee * Kava

The facts leading up to the tragic sequel
which, culminated yesterday. afternoon in
the dramatic meeting between the newly
wedded husband of _ the woman whom
Robinette avers deserted him and the self
confessed abductor of her child were ob
tained through 1 Police Officer Crane, who,
while placing Robinette under arrest in
a First-avenue saloon, had to overpower
and handcuff him in order "to prevent him
from firing point blank at the man who
yesterday wedded- the mother of the ab
ducted child. . :
Goaded to desperation because the wo

Though repeated attempts were made 10
force him intothe admission that the lit

CHICAGO, Feb. 5.â Eugene I. Gowell,
who says he is the famous Charley Ross,
walked into detective headquarters early
and requested the police to look up his
family tree. Gowell, who*has been travel
ing about the country and is now living
In Chicago at 77 Sangamon street, says
he has dim recollections of living In dif
ferent and more comfortable surroundings
in a house by the side of a little brook.
As to the circumstance surrounding his
birth or the ' kidnaping episode, Gowell
knows nothing, but accounts for this by
explaining he was'drugged* at the" time
and the drug had left his mind a blank.
Twenty-four years ago, he says, he lived
with Mrs. Clara Itobblns In Los Angeles,
who he was led to believe was his mother.
EUGENE GOWELL CLAIMS
THAT HE IS CHARLEY ROSS
She married William or John Gowell, he
says. They are now living in Los Ange
les. The man said he has. been Informed
by his brother Clarence that he was the
adopted son of Mrs. Gowell.' Some years
ago he left the Gowell home in Los Ange
les and since then he says he has traveled
about the country. Recently, he said, he
made known his claims at Logansport,
Ind., and was placed in ah insane asylum.
Since then he has hesitated in relating the
circumstances. The police 4 are not inclined
to take Gowell's claims seriously.

of $1500 in "the Senate," the finest equip
ped joint In Topekal Sheldld more, for
she gained the first police protection given
her since she started out on. her saloon
smashing career at Wichita a month ago.
The police followed up her "raid of to-day |
and arrested the proprietor, of '.'the Sen

place.- Mrs. Nation was arrested, ." but
promptly released. * "
" Mrs. Nation arid her wreckers, armed
with hatchets, sallied fqrth at, daybreak
and causht the Jolntist napping. They
forced their way past a negro who guard
ed the door and in less than ten minutes
had strewn the floor with broken*Tnlrrors,
bottles, slot machines and splintered bar
fixtures. The negro fired a shot of warn
ing into the celling, but It had no effect.
Presently a policeman stalked leisurely
into the room and said:
"Well. Sister Nation, I guess we will
have to arpest you again.'.'
Mrs. Nation had Just smashed the last
bottle nr.d was ready to go.
."All right," she responded cheerily;
"you Just came when I wanted you to."
She turned -back when she reached the
door; and inquired, "Everything cleaned
up; ladles?"
The Police Judge Â¦was glad to release
her when she appeared for trial, and after
administering a tongue lashing to' that of
ficial Mrs.; Nation soon walked- proudly
down ; Kansas avenue, free again to smash
and preach.
Michael Wagner, supposed to be, the
owner of "the | Senate," j made the best of
his opportunity \ and promptly secured a
quantity of liquor to supply the thirst of
the crowds; that poured into his place to
view the wreckage that, the Natlonltes
had wrouzh't. '.' ' . ?-.":
During the afternoon two deputies from
Sheriff Cooke's office raided the place and
arrested "Wagner, Shep I Little j and two
guards and took charge of; the stock of
liquors. Warrants ; had been sworn out
only for Wagner and Little, but one of
thedeputies was so angry -when a guard
struck him that he. arrested both guards.
After Mre. Nation had wrecked the Joint
this morning, the porter, who made an
Ineffectual attempt , to hold the place
against the smashers, ran for help. Soon
the chief proprietor, "Shep" Little, was
found and the Joint was opened for busi
ness. People who had heard of the smash
commencedto drop Into the Joint, just to
see the wreck. In a short tirhe the crowd
had become so large" that It required four
bartenders to wait on them. By 9 o'clock
the crowd numbered nearly 200, and from
then until 1 the police , raided the ; place it
fluctuated Â¦ between â¢ 200 and . 250. Among
those present were advocates of temper
ance; who* wished to, see the work of the
crusaders. " The crowd around the. bar de
manded .souvenirs,; and the' bartenders
gathered up bits of glass from the broken
mirror, glvingraway s a small , piece with
every glass of beer. A man stationed him
self at" the front door and cried, "Souve

AGAINST METHODS USED.
SACRAMENTO, : Feb. 5.â The man - ar
rested at Seattle' cannot be Robinette, the
printer, for, hie is dead. The prisoner ia
probably the Robinette who was employed
Beveral . years ago as , a' clerk at \ the Sut
ter Club. He got into some trouble with
the club, and "left town three * t or; â¢ four
years ago.' His . name was Allen Â¦ Robin
ette.' He did not work in a printing office
and ; never worked for the Record-Union. '
Not Robinette, the Printer.
Robinette .claims that he is the father
of the child. "., The police doubt the truth
of this i claim.? /
Detective Powers and Captain Willard
attempted to get from Robinette the.ad
mission that no harm had befallen the
little one, but he insisted that such was
hot the case and entered his cell repeating
the words: "I killed It: I killed itV;; Â¦
"Yes. the child is dead; I killed it, as I
said I would do. I will not tell where it
is, but her mother will never see her face
again."
Robinette was plainly under the Influ
ence of liquor and soon became very volu
ble. In answer, to a auestlon by the offi
cer he stated that yoaterday afternoon ho
found that Mrs. Colburn had married
Colburn and that he had made good his
threat to do away with her child".
"What did you do : with It?" asked the
officers.
"Killed it." he answered. Hesitating a
moment Robinette finally continued:.
Colburn had no sooner pointed the man
out to Crane than Robinette, seeing his
rival, reached for his revolve*. Crane
sprang upon him and wrenched the pistol
from his hand, and rang for the police
patrol wagon. Roblnetto was taken to
Captain Wilkard's office, where Jailor
Corning attempted to search him. He re
sisted, and it- became necessary to use
force. Ah examination of his pockets re
vealed, besides the revolver, a vicious
looking razor, carried in an upper vest
pocket.
Officer Crane. was detailed on the case,
and together he and Colburn began a sys
tematic search of the city to locate Rob
inette. After several hours, during which
time they called at Roblnette's room at
the Vendome Hotel, they finally located
Robinette in the DIHer bar on First ave
nue.
Mrs. Colburn immediately placed the
note in her husband's hands and he in
tiyn reported the affair at police head
quarters. â¢
Colburn came to this city yesterday and
proceeded to the County Recorder's of
fice, where he obtained a license to marry
Mrs. Kavanaugh, and they were shortly
afterward made man and wife by a local
minister. Little suspecting what awaited
them, the newly wedded couple returned
to their lodgings. Mrs. Colburn found a
letter writen in lead pencil and sighed by
Robinette, in which he told her he had
abducted the child and warned her that
she would never see Its face again unless
she came to him in person and without
the entanglements of a husband. It was
broadly Intimated that the child 'would
suffer should the warning be Ignored.
Recently Robinette came to this city to
live. Not long since he claims to have
become apprised of the fact that A. 'D.'
Colburn, a mechanic, , who resides ln.Sno
hcmlsh, was a suitor for the woman's
hand.
According to the story of Robinette,* who
formerly conducted a hotel In Everett, he
met Mrs. Colburn over four years ago
and they lived together for a considera
ble leneth of time.
The principals in the affair/ are Robi
nette, ' Mrs.^ Clara Â«. Colburn (nee * Kava
naugu>, A. D. Colburn" and tfeft'foilNyear
old child of the former, i
The facts leading up to the tragic sequel
which, culminated yesterday. afternoon in
the dramatic meeting between the newly
wedded husband of _ the woman whom
Robinette avers deserted him and the self
confessed abductor of her child were ob
tained through 1 Police Officer Crane, who,
while placing Robinette under arrest in
a First-avenue saloon, had to overpower
and handcuff him in order "to prevent him
from firing point blank at the man who
yesterday wedded- the mother of the ab
ducted child. . :
Goaded to desperation because the wo
man with whom. he claims to have once

A. M. Robinette, a printer, who claims to
have been at one. time employed on the
Sacramento Record-Union, made this
statement at police headquarters to-nlghl

Though repeated attempts were made 10
force him intothe admission that the lit

plained his plan to make the use of the

Martin Kelly referred with pride to the

He spoke of the difficulty presented by
the constitutional provision that all dele
gates to State conventions must be chosen
at primaries, claiming that any primary
law must be mandatory so far as State
conventions were concerned. .
Spelling said that these difficulties, ap
pearing so vividly to his friends,' Kelly
and Sam Ralney, would be cleared up
easily by the subcommittee. Spelling went
Into the matter of test of party affiliation.
He said the test applied bv the Cutter bill
was no test at all and utterly absurd.
Max Popper believed "the test applied
should be simple, and he considered that
embodied in the Johnson bill about right.
"He cut that out of my bill bodily," said
Senator Cutter.
"Ttere Is nothing In your bill that beari
the slightest resemblance to the test In
the Johnson bill," retorted Spelling, who
Is tbe author of the bill introduced by
Johnson.
It is evident that the legislators will find
their most difficult problem to be that of
devising a test of party affiliation that
will prevent the members of one party
voting for delegates to the opposition

REJECTION OF SUTRO f S
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
Assembly Votes I>owii Proposition to
Give Counties Power to Adopt
Charters.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 5. â Sutro's Assembly con
stitutional amendment No. 10, giving to
counties the pov/er to adopt charters on
the plan of municipal freeholders char
ters, was defeated In the Assembly this
morning. Its author changed his vote in
order to give notice of a .motion to recon
sider.
Sutro defended the Innovation as being
a method of giving- to the Interior coun
ties of the State equal rights of self-gov
ernment with San Francisco. Brown of
San Mateo and Dunlap . opposed the
amendment as being a dangerous Innova
tion, violating the theory of government
in California by which uniform govern
ment prevails in the various counties.
Melick defended the measure, and said
that the constitutional convention not
only established uniform county govern
ment but uniform municipal government
as^vell. SInceÂ»theo Individual charters
had been framed for municipalities, and
as the change, had worked well in that
direction its test In county governments
was desirable. He said our present sys
tem was very expensive and cited the ex
ample of Los Angeles, whose county gov
ernment costs $3000 more per annum than
the State government of Minnesota.
The meeting to-night also decided upon
certain general propositions as to the form
of the law to be framed, as follows:
Firstâ The law shall not be strictly
mandatory, but in the case of sparsÂ© local
population, where the expense might be
too great, it shall be optional.
Secondâ Election officers shall be chosen
by election Commissioners, Boards of Su
pervisors or similar responsible bodies.
Thirdâ There shall be but one baliot-box
for all parties.
Fourthâ There shall be separate ballots
for the partle's.
Fifthâ The primary elections for all par
ties shall be held at the same time, at the
same polling place and In the same man
ner.
The committees decided to refer the bills
to a Joint sub-committee, consisting of
the following members: Senators Devlin,
Cutter and Davis, and Assemblymen Mac

F. W. Dohrmann. president of the Mer
chants' Association, opened proceedinss
by expressing the pleasure ot the com
mittee at being accorded the privilege of
addressing the joint committee on health.
He said he had had but little time to pre
pare for such a meeting, but the commit
tee represented all the commercial bodies
of the city and Its members were able to
give the'sentiments of those bodies and of
the citv upon the measures against which
It was "the duty vt the visiting committee
to protest. He introduced Charles L.
Naylor of the Commerce Committee as
lh<- first speaker.
Mr. Naylor read the resolutions recently
passed at a mass-meeting and already
pent to the Legislature, commenting upon
them as he read. He declared there was
r.o doubt that the bill providing for the
SI<jO,W) was for the purpose of providing a
State quarantine and creating places for
gomebody. He said, too. that the people
of the State were suspicious of the bill,
and wouid be suspicious of any bill carr>
ing an appropriation of JIOO.O-jO, if an at
tempt be made to rush it through as this
till had been lushed through. As to the
bfU providing for the appointment of a
State quarantine officer. Mr. Naylor said
it was inoperative anyway, ar.d there was
no place in the civil system of the State
which provided work for such an office.
Hugh Craig, an ex-president of the
Chamber of Commerce. aJid representing
that body before the legislative commit
tee, was the next speaker. He described
the process of a ship entering the harbor
and passing first the Federal and then the
State quarantine and the conflicts that
inevitably followed their inspections. He
paid they rever tried to work in harmony,
but seemed always at cross purposes. The
l~Â«-deral service, he said, was efficient,
er.d there was no use for a State service.
\V. li. Marston, representing the ship
owner?, spoke in much the same strain,
acMing v that the only complaint was not
that the Federal quarantine was not strict
enouph. but that it has been too strict.
Georgf* Plummer of the same associa
tion Indorsed his colleagues words and
added some of his account of the ex
pense necessarily caused by the dual ser
vice.
A. C. Rulofson of the San Francisco
Beard of Trade spoke on the expediency
cf the bill. He said there was no use
for a State quarantine, because any one
pa^s*-d by the Federal quarantine could
obtain his release through the United
States courts, should the State quarantine
holij him uy.
William M. Bunker and George W. Mc-
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 5.â Representatives from all
of the commercial bodies of San Frands
co appeared before the health committees
of the Senate r.nd Assembly this evening.
The meeting was held in the Senate cham
ber, and there were almost as many per
f ons present as at a regular session of the
Senate body. The objection was directed
to the three bills emanating from the of
fice of the Governor and introduced in
both the Senate and the Assembly, which
have been rushed with all possible speed.
Jt was the belief of the gentlemen from
San Francisco that the bills practically
amounted to the establishment of a Stato
quarantine in supreme control of the State
health. The representatives are satisfied
with the Federal service.
Still another view Is that Johnson'*
scheme is to sidetrack the protests of the
commercial Interests. There 19 no doubt
that in the end the Judiciary Committe.*
will make its report 'n accordance with
the Governor's wishes. It has done so in
the past durlng-this session and will con
tinue to do so. Though there are some In
dependent men on the committee there is
a Â¦ majority of the other kind and these
support Johnson to the point of making
him practically supreme in the commit
tee. Very often he says to an As$emby
man yvho has been pleading before the
committee fora pet measure:
"What you say la all eood enough but
the committee Is against you. "We will
now go Into executive session."
And in executive session the commltte*,
not having previously taken any stand,
falls Into line behind Its chairman. If
Johnson caji succeed In turning the
stream of commercial opposition to th3
plague bills Into the millrace of his com
mittee he will control the grinding. If
work among the members at large is neg
lected the bills will be passed next Tues
day on special order If the Governor still
desires such legislation.
Condemn Health Sills.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 6.â The City Board
of Health has passed resolutions Btrongly
condemning the so-called plague bills now
before the Legislature and criticizing the
action of the Governor.
Another group of Assemblymen, suspi
cious also of Johnson's good faith in the
matter, believe that his object Is to lull
the opposition of San Francisco merchania
into temporary quiet, hoping that mean
while the Senate will pass the appropria
tion bill, which, after all, contains the
milk of th*Â» cocoanut.
A general discussion followed the ad
dresses by the members of the visiting
committee. In which the emerKipncr pha--Â»*
of the question was bandied back and
forth. The general sentiment of the
legislators seemed to be against the bills
and there promises to be a hot n\eht when
they reach the floor of the Senate.
The committee will pass upon the bills
to-morrow.
GOVESNOE'S FHIENDS RETBEA.T.
Delay Action on Bemaining Two
Health Bills in Assembly.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 5.â Assembly bills 65S and
559, on special order to-day, were left
over a week, retainln? their positions on
special order. These are the quarantine
measuresâ companion L>iils to 560, making
the $100,000 appropriationâ which havo
aroused the opposition of the San Fran
cisco commercial bodies, although they
were being pressed by Governor Gage and
his friends in the name of the commercial
Interests of the State.
Johnson, who crowded the appropria
tion bill through before the members real
ized the existence ot outside opposition
and while members wore Icnorant of the
fact that SJS.OOO remains at the disposal of
the State Board of Health, makinsr th<j
new appropriation an unwarranted ex
travagance, shrank from the contest to
day. He said that In view of the opposi
tion that had developed he was willing
that the bills over a week and that the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco,
the Beard of Trade and other bodies be
notified to appear before the Judiciary
Committee on Friday night to state their
objections. This procedure was agreed
upon and the anticipated contest this
morning was deferred.
Johnson's action >s variously . inter
preted. Some believe that the Governor
and his friends have taken this method
of retiring gracefully from their attempt
to rush through measure's before the pub
lic awakened to their Cull Import. Tho
great meeting of the Jian Francisco busi
ness mpn and their strong resolutions
have left the bills without a leg to stand
cn. aside from possible partisan deter
mination to force them to passage in spite
of lark of merit. In view of this some pre
dict thr.t the Assembly Judiciary Commit
tee will reverse Its former action, again
in accordance with ihe Governor's wishes,
and report apalnst the bills.
Dr. Matthews was asked how much re
mained of the ?o0,OOO appropriated In
1SS3 for much the same purpose as
Is designated for the $100,000. .and hÂ« said
there was ?2S,000. It was sugir*sle<l that
this be used before more is appro
priated.
Dohrmann denied this, and sild the
United States would attack disease wher
ever it was found.
At this point Dr. Matthews, secretary of
the State Board of Health, joined in the
discussion. He declared that there was
no intention, in any of the bill3, to estab
lish a State quarantine service in San
Francisco. He said whatever damage
had been done to the State had been done
by the Federal quarantine service. Be
sides, he said, when ence contagious dis
ease got on land the Federal quarantine
took r.o care of it and it was then thÂ«
duty of the State to take the proWem in
charge.
This brought Dohrmann to his feet. He
said the people were glad such a commis
sion was there. The people were tired
of having politics mixed with plague and
plague with politics. Besides, he said,
the question of plague played no part in
tlie discussion. It was one of quarantine
and the city wished to be delivered from
such a condition as had obtained while the
two services were in active operation in
the port of San Francisco. â¢ . '
Near Jr. followed, and it was while Mc-
Xear was speaking that Wolfe asked:
"Do you know there Is a commission
now in San Francisco Investigating the
plague question?"

Runyon testified that at no time had he
ever heard any complaint against- Emlay.
He said Emlay came to the . commission
highly recommended, and .there had been
no fault to find with him.
C. L. F. Marais, another employe of the
commission, will he heard to-nagrrow.'
I sun, therefore, of the opinion that in mak
ing the appropriation in question the Legisla
ture used the phrase ."actual traveling ex
penses" in the sense in which that prase has
been heretofore employed and understood . in
this State, and that, following the language of
your communication,- the Commissioners -were
entitled to their actual necessary llvlntr ex
penses In Parin while actually engaged In the
discharge of their official duties as such Com
missioners. Â¦ .
Gasklll and Runyon were .the. only wit
nesses of the day, both being called â¢ to
answer questions regarding the accounts
of the commission..
The interesting point brought out by
Gasklll was that Runyon paid the same
price for the medals he got that Em
lay says he paid, and that he got. them
from the same place. . Gasklll also ex
plained the contract to sell the Davidson
specimen by saying that the 10 per. cent
mentioned was to go to any one who
would sell the specimen for $5000. He said
he had made no effort to sell It. â¢
A letter from Commissioner General
Peck-to Mr. Runyon, in which the work
and the exhibit of â¢ the California Com
mission were highly commended, was put
into evidence.
This language, eo far aa I have been able to
learn, hae never been confined in Its meaning
to railroad fares or other actual cost of trans
portation, but has, I believe, been uniformly
held to Include the actual necessary living ex
penses of the officer while traveling In the
performance of his official duty, and where
such officer is compelled to absent himself
from his home and proceed to some point more
or less distant therefrom and there to remain
temporarily In the performance of his official
duties, his actual necessary living; expenses
while thus performing his duties have always
Ich n deemed included within the appropriation
made for "actual traveling expenses."
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford had
been asked to render his opinion as to
what "traveling expenses" were when ap
plied to the Paris Commissioners. His
opinion was that the Commissioners were
entitled to hotel expenses and living ex
penses, as well as transportation. The
Attorney General said of "traveling ex
penses":
There was little progress made in the
Investigation to-day. Emlay was not
present, and as he was due to appear yes
terday it Â¦was deemed time to notify him.
to show up or a sergeant at arms would
be sent after him.
Johnson said he had letters telling him
of some of the doings of the Commission
ers, and a man named T. P. Kecgan, who
lived In Santa Rosa, had told him more.
He was not asked for his letters, and the
committee contented itself Â¦with taking
down the name of T. P. Keegan.
"And I still think so," he added.
He said he had read in the newspapers
statements purporting to be Interviews
with persons who had been there, letters
purporting to come from officials, and
statements of persons who had received
medals without making any. exhibits, and
he believed there- was need of an investi
gation.
"I have no personal knowledge of the
doings of the commission in Paris â none
whatever," was the burden of his testi
mony.

THE ROOT OF THE MATTER.
He Cured Himself of Serious Stomach
Trouble Down to First Principles.
A man cf larpe affairs In one of our
prominent Eastern cities by too close at-
u-ntion to business, too little exercise and
too many club dinners, finally becan to
pay nature's tax. levied In the form of
. chronic stomach trouble; the failure of
his- digestion brought about a nervous Ir-
ritability, making it impossible to apply
himself to his daily business und finally
derang-ing the kidneys and heart.
In his own words he says: "I consulted
cno physician after another and each one
refined to understand my case, but all the
Barne they each failed to bring about the
return of my former digestion, appetite
and vipor. Fnr two years I went from
pillar to post, from one sanitarium to an-
other, I pave up smoking, I quit coffee
and even renounced niy daily glass or two
of beor, but without any marked improve- ;
.ment.
"Friends had often advised me to trv a
Trell known proprietary medicine, Stuart's
Dyppcppia Tablets, and I ht-d often
perused the newpapor advertisements of
the remedy, but never took anv stock in
advertised medicine* nor could" believe a
Dfl-eent patent medicine would touch my
case.
"To make a long story short, I finally
bought a oouple of packages at the near-
est drugr store and took two or three
tablets after each meal and occasionally a
tablet between meals, when I felt any
feeling of nausea or diseomfrrrt.
."I was Furprised at the end of the first
â¢week to note a. marked Improvement in
my appetite and general health and be-
fore the two packages were gone I was
certain that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
Â¦were polnfir to cure completely and they
<3id not disappoint me. I- can eat and
'lOeep and enjoy my coffee arvl cijrar and
no one would suppose I had ever known
the horrors of dyspepsia.
"Out of friendly curiosltv I wrote to (he
proprietors of the remedy asking for in-
formation as to what the tablets con-
tained and they replied that the principal
Ingredients were aseptic pepsin (Govern-
ment te*t>. malt ; diastase and other
natural digestives, w,,ieh dlpest food re-
irardless of the eon/lit Ion of the stomach "
The root of the matter is this, the diges-
tive elements contained in Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will digest the food, eive
the overworked stomach a chance to re-
cuperate and the nerves and whole system
receive the nourishment which can only
ccme from food: stimulants and nerve
tonics never Blve real strength, thev irfve
a fictitious strength, invariablv followed
t>y reaction. Every drop of blood, every
nerve and tissue is manufactured from
our dally food, and If you can Insure its
prompt action and complete digestion bv
the regular use of so Rood and wholesom^
a remedy as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets"
you will have no need of r.erve tonics of
Far.ltar'ums.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
nave been Jn tne market only a, few vearÂ«?
yet probably every drupplst in the United
States, Canada, and Great Britain now
sells them and consider them the most
popular end successful of .any nrenara-
tion for stomach troubles. '

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.â A cablegram
from United States Minister Hunter at
Guatemala City states that Sidney B.
Everett, secretary and* charge of the
United States legation there, committed
suicide yesterday by shooting himself in
the- mouth. He had suffered a long ill
ness, and It la said the act was committed
during a temporary aberration of mind
Mr. Everett was appointed from Massa
chusetts, being a son of a former chief
of the diplomatic bureau of the State De

sular service as Consul to Batavla In May

Invitation to McKlnley.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â Representative
Loud of California presented the President
to-day with an Invitation to atop at San
Jose on his Western > tour, and It is
thought he will accept and spend part of
a day there.
WASHINGTON, Feb. E.-The House to
day continued the discussion of the con
troverted questions in connection with the
postofflce appropriation bill. Grlggs of
Georgia spoke against the organizations
of postal employes, formed â¢with a view to
framing- legislation in their interest.
Moody of Massachusetts discussed the
question of railway mall pay from the
standpoint of a member, of the joint postal
commission. Bromwell of Ohio and Oalnes
of Tennessee assailed the appropriations
for special mall facilities from New York
to New Orleans, and Catchings of Missis
sippi and Meyer of Louisiana defended
these appropriations as necessary for the
expedition of the Southern mall.
Moody of. Massachusetts, wh'o was. a
member- of the Joint postal commission,
discussed the question of railway mail
pay In the light of the facts developed by
the commission. He said that If the Gov
ernment could have an ideal Second. As
sistant Postmaster General, who should
serve for a long period and who could be
absolutely untrammeled in his negotia
tions with the railroads, the Government
would be able to arrt-ve at a standard of
paymerit which would be perfect as near
as human imperfections would permit. He
did not mean, he said, to reflect in any
way upon the present Second Assistant
Postmaster General. He was speaking
simply of the difllculties which surround
ed existing conditions.
Moody said ihe postal commission de
veloped the fact that Instead of paying: to
the railroads on an average of 40 cents
per ton per mile for carrying the mails,
as the Postofflce Department had lead the
country to believe, the actual cost aver
aged about 12Â»,i cents per ton per mile.
From the investigation he had made
Moody said It was diflicult to tell which
was the more profitable to the railroads,
mall or express business. -
Bromwell of Ohio opposed the proposi
tion for special facilities, declaring 1 that
the Postmaster General repeatedly had
declared that he did not desire the ap
propriations and had used them only be
cause Congress made them.
Catchingrs of Mississippi, who was a
member of the postal commission denied
the latter statement. He Insisted that the
Postmaster General desired Congress to
take the responslbiliy of discontinuing
the special service because he did not
want to assume that responsibility him
self.
Meyer of Louisiana defended the South
ern fast mail appropriation. It was op
posed by Gaines of Tennessee. Without
action, at 5:30 p. m., the House adjourned.

"WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.â The Senate to
day passed the district appropriation bill
and partially considered the bill making
appropriations for the support of the
West Point Military Academy. During
the day the ship subsidy bill, by a vote of
the Senate, was formally laid aside and
superseded as the unfinished business.
The Senate met at 11 o'clock. Chandler
of New Hampshire presented the cre
dentials of his successor. Henry iJ. Burn
ham. .
The chair appointed Hanna, Spooner
and Jones of Arkansas, members of the
Joint Comlmttee on Inauguration, and
Chandler and Caffrey as tellers of the
vote for President and Vice President
when the electoral vote is counted.
Teller brought - up and spoke on his
resolution calling upon the riecretajrr of
War for information concerning the re
ports of the deportation of George T.
Hice, editor of a Manila newspaper, to
the United States by the general in
charge oÂ£ the American forces in the
Philippine Islands. He quoted the press
reports concerning Mr. Rice's case, say
ing that he did not wonder that he waa
deiiant. contending that there was no
law Justifying his expulsion. Teller said
he did not Know whether Mr. Rice's
paper had been suppressed, but he had
been credibly informed that four news
papers had been closed out in Luzon by
lhtÂ» military authorities.
Teller spoke of the proceeding as one
of importance to all, for Rice was a citi
zen of the United States, and an offense
against him was an offense against every
citizen of the country. Â¦ .
Teller's resolution was agreed to and
the District of Columbia appropriation
bill was then taken up.
At 1 o'clock this afternoon thÂ© subsidy
bill was laid before the Senate as un
finished business. Allison asked that it
be laid aside temporarily.
Jones of Arkansas objected to this re-
Quest. Explaining his position, he said
the effect of granting the request would
be to continue the subsidy bill as the un
iinlshed business, and he did not believe
this would be done, in. view of the condi
tion of the Senate's business. Practical
ly all the appropriations were yet to be
considered, and he, for one, was willing
to give them ail the time necessary.
If the appropriation bills should fall,
their failure, ..e said, would bo due to
keeping the subsidy bill pending, and he
thought the country should understand
the disposition to eet aside everything
else for that measure. He referred to
the talk of an extra session of Congress,
saying that It was due to the evident de
termination to keep the subsidy bill to
the front to the exclusion of ail other
measures. lie considered other subjects
more Important, and thought they should
take precedence. IIÂ© concluded with a
positive objection to granting the request
temporarily to lay the subsidy bill aside.
"Objection Is made," . announced the
presiding officer, Gallinger, then in the
chair.
"Then, Mr. President, I move that the
consideration of the District of Columbia
appropriation bill be proceeded with," said
Allison.
There was no opposition to the motion
and it prevailed without dissent and con
sideration of the district bill was con
tinued.
The bill was passed at' 5 o'clock. The
Senate then took up the bill making: ap
propriations for the Military Academy.
All the amendments, suggested by the
Committee on Military Affairs, Including
that prohibiting; hazing, were agreed to.
Foraker offered an amendment provid
ing for the appointment of four cadets
from Porto JUco and Allen an amend
ment requiring cadets upon entering "West
Point to take an oath not to engage in
hazing, but without acting upon either,
the Senate at 6:10 o'clock adjourned.

LO3 ANGELES, Feb. 5.â For thÂ® twen
ty-four hours ending at 5 p. m. to-day the
rainfall measured 2.30 Inches, making a
total of 11.96 for the season. Nearly
every crossing in town was flooded and
those at the foot of the. hills. were raging
wastes of water. Impassable to any who
were not encased in hip boots. The street
car service was temporarily, paralyzed.
The force of the water roll A rocks down
hill In many, places and WÂ«os Angeles
again presented the appearance of a
night last November when the floodgates
of heaven opened and deluged the city.
Discharge pipes leading from business
block roofs were spurting water half
way across the alleys this morning and
the river looked like old times. People
were lined up under the awnings watch-
Ing the progress of the storm and occa
sionally cheering Bome particularly vio
lent outburst, thus showing the general
feeling of welcome which pervades South
ern California on the approach of rain.
There were many complaints from pri
vate property owners of damage by storm
water,, but nothing serious. When the
ttorm was at its worst this morning a
saloon man at a corner of Los Angeles
street engaged a rowboat, which waa
subsequently" used to good purpose.
The railroads suffered .by ihe heavy
downpour. At an early hour the South

MERCED. Feb. 6. â The most disastrous
flood that has ever been experienced in
Merced occurred here this afternoon. Bear

miles east of here, and, with the water
that broke through tha banks of Owens
Creek, made its way through the fields to
town. On the Southern Pacific Railroad
reservation and on Front street the cur
rent runs with great rapidity and has the
appearance of a small river. Several fami
lies were lorced to leave their residences
and seek other quarters, as the water was
flowing over the floors of their houses.
Merchants are removing goods, from their
cellars to places of safety and in several
stores the water is several inches abovÂ©
the floor. The Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe Railroad companies' tracks are under
water and several hundred feet of the
roadbed have been washed away. Tele
phone messages from the mountain
towns state that the water in the creeks
and rivers Is the highest that has ever
been know and that during the night the
head may be expected to reach Merced,
In which case the town will suffer much
damage. For several miles to the east
and south of the city there is one im
mense sheet of water, which wil Idestroy
much grain. At 10 o'clock to-night rain
was still -falling.

of the town. At the bridge, which Is
upon the main street, are located flood,
gates for holding in the tide water of
the creek above the bridge. I vast night
the gates were closed. The water from
the hills came down In torrents, which,
with the tide water, threatened, to inun
date the main part of town, and undoubt
edly would have done so had not the gates
given way. As It was no damage was
done except to the gates, which were
badly wrenched..

The preliminary examination of Robert
E. Glaze, charged with the murder of his
partner, William Trewhella. at the Wind

abrupt conclusion yesterday morning. At

witness said he would call no more. The
testimony of the defendant and his wife
and her daughter he would reserve for
the higher court, he said.
The witness examined- was Albert B.
Shelley, Glaze's stepson, who testified
that he was chief clerk at the hotel. On
the morning -of the shooting Trewhella
came to him, he said, and asked how much
money there was in the cash drawer.
Witness referred him to the cash book,
which Trewhella refused to examine, and
said, "I'll clear the whole gang out of
here."

of the people who have ridden on passes
will in the future have to pay to ride.
The new president had hardly settled
himself at his roller too desk when he
called for the pass l.st. He evidently
thought that the management had been too
promiscuous in issuing free ride slips

of the pass system, states that every poli

I ruthers & Shields was unfortunate
I In losing Its very useful three
1L year-old Tyr through an accident
in the mile event, fifth on the card,
at Tanforan Park yesterday. Silurian, the
entry of Pat Dunne, ruled an odds : on
choice in the ring, with Tyr. ridden by
Tommy Burns, next in demand at threes.
The field ran well bunched around the
turn, Compass showing the way. As the
backstretch turn was approached Tyr sud
denly fell back and was pulled up by
Burns. It was later discovered that the
colt had been fearfully cut down, tho oft
hind tendon being severed as if by a
cleaver. As there seemed to be no possi
ble way of mending the' injury Alex
Shields said he would have the horse de
stroyed. Tyr was a brown colt by King
ston-Miss Dixie, and was purchased in
Chicago last summer by Carruthers &
Shields for $2500. Burns laid the blame for
the accident to Milt Henry, who rode
Bavassa, though, 1 of course, it was entire
ly unavoidable and is one of the things
owners have to contend with. Silurian
won the race in a hard drive from the 20
to 1 shot Compass, and as going a dis
tance was the strong forte of Tyr he
would undoubtedly have been a dangerous
contender. . â,.
In the Owners* handicap, taken by The
Lady, still another horse was cut down,
and, strangely enough, a second choice
also. While going along nice and handy
Ordnung the star mudlark of the Schorr
stable, suddenly fell out of the running
on tho stretch turn, finishing far back in
the rear. An examination showed a se
vere cut on the nigh hind leg that will
shelve the horse for a couple of months.

KNOWS NOTHING
OF FIGHT RULES
Director Lawson's Admis
sions on the Stand at .
Cincinnati.
Jeffries and Buhlin Are Still in
Training and the Demand for
Seats Continues to Be
- Large.
CINCINNATI, j Feb. 5.â The arguments
and testimony were heard to-day before
Judge Hollister of the Common Pleas
Court on an application for an Injunction
against the" Jeffries-Ruhlln fight in this
city February 15.
After considerable sparring among the
attorneys it was decided that the case
would proceed on Its merits for a per
manent injunction rather than for a tem
porary restraining order, but the defense
reserved the . right of appeal to higher
courts. Judging from the slow progress
made to-day and the long list of wit
nesses, it is believed now that the hear
ing will not be completed this week and
that the decision, of Judge Hollister may
not be had before next week. After sub ;
mining the contracts and other docu
ments only four witnesses were examined
to-day as follows* I .
Herman Witte. an attorney, who was
the middleman between the pugilists and
the Saengerfest Athletic Association; E.
G. Cook, the personal representative of.
Manager Brady; I. N. Miller, superintend
ent of the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany, and Fenton Lawson. who Is a di
rector and secretary o.f both the Saenger
fest Musical Association and the Saenger
fest Athletic Association.
Mayor Fleischmann and other important
witnesses were on hand to testify, but
they were not called, owing to the long
examination of Lawson.
The feature of the day was the exami
nation of Lawson. as it indicated what
the atorneys for the injunction propose to
do with all members of the Saengerfest
Athletic Association. They are all promi
nent business men and none of them are
known as athletes, although they re
organized their musical association into
an athletic association after, Attorney
Witte succeeded in his negotiations with
Manager Brady for Jeffries and Ruhlln
to meet here on February 15. Lawson
was closely examined as to what he knew
.about music and the manly art. He was
an expert witness in thÂ« . former and
caused much laughter in hi3 replies to
questions regarding boxing. He could
not repeat any of the rules of the Marquis
oi Queensberry or any of the theory and
practice of the ring. All of the other
members of the Sat-ngerfest Athletic As
sociation were present . and heard the
ordeal through which Mr. Lawson passed
and it is understood that they will all be
called upon to pass through a similar ex
amination. As Mr. Lawson is a leader in
musical circles he was questioned closely
as to the rates charged at operas, concerts
and theaters as compared with the rates
the association was getting for seats for
the Jeffrles-Ruhlin performance.
Lawson was also closely questioned re
garding the repeated interviews of himself
and his associates with Mayor Flelsch
mann, who gave them a permit for the
contest, and Lawson said that the Mayor
did not think the Governor would inter
fere. Lawson insisted that the Saenger
fest Athletic Association Intended to pro
ceed within the bounds of the law, as
their permit from Mayor Kleischmann
was for a boxing contest and not for a
prizefight. ' The attorneys for' the " In
junction questioned him regarding all the
fights that both Jeffries and Ruhlln had
participated in, and called attention to
the recent statement of Ruhlln. that there
would be a new champion of the world
on the morning of.. February 16* When
asked -whether 1 the world's -championship
could be settled or determined in a. boxing
contest that would come within .the pro
visions'of the Ohio statutes,; the witness
stated that he did not know anything
about that line of work.' ' *" -.,â¢Â¦Â¦ /â¢Â¦
There la an unusually brilliant array of
attorneys on both sides and the witnesses,
who are members for the most part of
the Saengerfest Athletic Association are
firomlnent business men, so that the hear
nsr brings out many amusing incidents.
The attorneys to-day Insisted' to Mr.
Lawson that he was a very queer director
of an athletic association when ho knew
nothing of the records of Jeffries or Ruh
lin or of men who had preceded Jeffries
ten the holder of the belt. The promoters
of the fight to-night Insist that they are
more confident than ever that the fight
will bo pulled off here. Jeffries did not
let up on his training to attend the trial
and Ruhlln resumed his training in the
afternoon.
The sale of tickets to-day Â¦was unusually
large and all the preparations for the
event are going ahead the same as If there
waB no opposition.

SEASON'S RAIN
GOOD FOR STATE
The Generous Distribution
; Insures an Abiindaht
Harvest.
San Francisco and the State In general
are being pretty well , supplied with rain
this Â¦ year - as compared with previous
years. In but oieven of the last twenty
nine years has there been more rain in
the same period ' than has fallen up to
date. - . â¢ â¢ '
This season's rainfall has been a good
thing for the State. The- water has come
down Just In the right time and fallen in
the most beneficial manner, according to
Forecast Official McAdie. - .
"Looking backward for all these years,"
said Mr. McAdie yesterday, '.'I. find that
there are but eleven years when we havÂ«
had as much or -more rainfall than this
year. What. Is true about;' the bay re
gion Is k .also v true, throughout the State.
The rain has fallen most opportunely. In
December. 1890, the record was 33.63
Inches, of which' 14 inches fell in' the
month of December. This did not do half
as much . good . as 'the present 1 - season's
rain. The increase is also marked in the
southern portion -of the State and from
our latest telegrams the Sweetwater and
Otal danis In San .Diego Â¦ County will be
filled to overflowing. . . :. â¢--.â¢
. "The distinguishing feature of this sea
son's rainfall is its generous and general
distribution. Lxjs Angeles had 12 inches,
as against 4' last year; : San Diego; with
3.75 Inches a year ago, has had 5 this year,
and so it goes air along the coast and in
terior. . ; Â¦ - Â¦ -. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦- . ; :,,-.' ,-Â¦'.Â¦ - -Â¦Â¦;":.'-'
"This change may. be 'ascribed to the
southerly movement " of Â¦ the Â¦ storm area
and the movement of the largrer perma
nent areas: of high and low rressure ac
companying- the path of the storms."
In hl3 weekly crpp Bulletins Director
McAdle gives a glowlnff report of horti
cultural conditions throughout the Stats
and says . in ; a few i words ; that ' prospects
here never looked more favorable. . .-.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's new

Fhe is the last of the three new vessels
built for the Australian trade and Is ex

Hayward. who superintended the building
of all three vessels, is in command of the

i I ty on the steamer Guatemala to
' \ day. The agents cf the netv l'ner
LL have decided to let the general
public know what South America
can send north, eo the first steamship of
the line Is to be thrown open to the pub
lic. No vessel that has Â«ver come through
the Golden Gate had "better cabin accom
modaticr.s. an-1 th<i crew say the Guate
mala Is a good "carrier." Shs Is only two
years eld and is officered throughout by
Englishmen or Americans. In consequence
she is almost &s eplck and span cs a
yacht.
The crew ot the Guatemala had a novel
experience when off GuayaquIL An earth
quake shook the steamship up and for a
time all the sailors on board thought she
was going down. It was on January 6. at
7:15 p. m., when the scare came. The
Eteamship was then about 160 miles from
Guayaquil, or, to be exact. In latitude 4
degrees seventeen minutes south, longi
tude Â£1 decrees 22 minutes west, when the
upheaval came
"For a moment It seemed as though we
were tossed up to heaven, and the next
moment were descending Into hell." said
Chief Er.&ineer Campbell yesterday. "The
Â«?ngir.es began to race, but the second en
gineer was at thÂ« throttle and almost as
quick as j-ou could say 'boo' the machin
ery was under control. When we reached
Guayaquil we learned that one of ti-e
heaviest earthquakes in the history of the
country had takea place, but that, strange
to say, very little damage had been done."

AND VISITORS WILL BE WELCOMED. . .
The meeting will be resumed to-day and
this evening the association will partake
of a banquet in tho maple room of tho
Palace Hotel. .
A humorous paper on "Art in Fire Un
derwriting," prepared by Garrett Brown
of Denver, was â¢ read by Mr. Dohrmann.
W. H. Gibbons read a paper on "Pulver
ized Coal as Fuel." â¢ ' .
Five capers were read cn "The Settle
ment of Growing Grain Losses." William
Sexton. W. H. Lowden, Calvert Meade.
V. C. Drlffleld and P. G.-Argall presented
abl^ arguments on the subject. T. i ques
tion was treated on the points of tha
"renter's interest" and the "land owner' 3
Interest." The speakers mainly favored a
plan by which the owner of rented land
should bear his proportion of the expense
of the raising and harvesting of grain,
which might be burned.
"Women as Local Agents" was the topla
of the paper presented by John W.
Holmes. On the Pacific Coast 128 women
were acting as agents and of thin num
ber 95 were in California: While women
might make good solicitors for Insurance
companies. Mr. Holmes did not think
they would rise to be heads of depart
ments.
11. T. Laroey of Denver, Colo., read an
Interesting paper entllieJ â¢'looking For
ward." He dwelt on the heavy expense
caused by competitive business in insur
ance circles and urged that the only ra
tional way to reduce competition and ex
penses was by purcnase, absorption or
conquest.
I would recommend that our annual meet
ings take place betweoji the 2ith and the 31st
of December each year, and falling that,
thould be held in February or March. I would
like to see the appointment of a committee
to take up the matter of reinsurance among
offices. There should' also, be a plan for pay
ment of return premiums on canceled rein
surance and the continuation of the commit
tee on publication of papers on losses. Im
portant Insurance declsluns should be published
monthly. . Â¦
The question of the prevention of flreÂ« is a
most important subject and It is* your duty to
do all you can to that end. Wherever you
find that proper flre ordinances are lacking
you xhould Influence public opinion to secure
the passage of the required ordinances. Se
lective building laws zhculd be remedied and
stringent laws secured prohibiting the storage
of chemicals, oils, expltalves, etc.
The last year has been a disastrous cne.for
insurance companies. The losses by fire in the
United States and Canada amounted to $163,
362,?tO, being $27,000,000 more than in the pre
vious year. On the Pacific Coast the losses In
theflast year were J5,Â«SO,621, while tha busineis*
increased over-, the previous year by J6C2.673.
The ratio of losses to premium business- was
43.3 per cent. The fire at Preacott, Ariz., en
tailed heavy losses on the companies, -but on
the whole the closing. year of the last century
has been a satisfactory one.
A large number of members of the Flro
Underwriters' Association of tho Pacific
were present yesterday afternoon at tho
twenty-fifth annual meeting of the or
ganization, held at the headauarters, 303
California street. -President, -. Frank J.
Devlin occupied the chair and opened the
proceedings: by extending a warm wel
come to those present and also to Deputy
Insurance Commissioner Shlveley of tho
State of Washington' and ex-Commis
sioner Heffner of Washington, who were
present as guests of the association.
President Devlin, in delivering tho an
nual address, dwelt on the history of the
wssociatlon, which owed Its formation to
tne great nre in Virginia City in 1S75. In
part President Devlin said:
Losses in United States and Canada
Reached the Enonnous Sum
of $163,362,250 Dur

It is a. far cry from the . story of the man with the
hoeUo a panegyric on royalty,, but Ed\yiriMarkham
has sounded it. Perhaps , he wanted'to' show us that
the practice of poetry, is a trade after all and that sen
timent does not necessarily mean sincerity. \
: ' y The gypsy, prince over whose dead body a nomad
tribe-has been mourning in Oakland had at least one
satisfaction not usually enjoyed by royalty.' He was
not troubled by either the cares or emoluments of

The municipal policy of Mayor Phelan is becom
ing explicable. He.is urging that white gamblers be

CZ; ROM the Scarborough (England) Post we have
I received a supplement issued by that paper on
January 1 giving "a serious attempt to forecast
a century ahead" and to "present a twenty-first cen
tury newspaper as we think it will probably be." It
is asserted that the aim has been to make "the fore
cast as accurate as the information at our disposal
and the known expectations of scientists and experts
will allow."
A publication of that kind is interesting. It does
not repeat any of the sensational extravagances of
prediction to which we are accustomed, and on the
whole is a very mild-looking sheet. It is printed on
tinted paper, having no illustrations except those de
signed to show the improvements made on the water
front of Scarborough during the century between
1901 and 2001.
The Scarborough forecasts are of course uninterest
ing to us. In the matter of world politics, however,
we will note with some interest that the forecast
speaks of the "predominance of the United* States and
Russia, the decadence of the Latin races, the gradual
eclipse of British naval and commercial supremacy,
.the deepening color of the black and the yellow belt.'
the immense development of South America,
and the Oriental industrial competition," as things
already foreseen in 1901. The review goes on to say:
"On the other hand, the 'yellow specter' of a 'Chinese
invasion of Europe which haunted the minds of nine
teenth century Emperors and journalists has proved
to be a nightmare, while the growth of Germany in
power, wealth and population and commerce has far
exceeded the- most sanguine expectations."
After noting that in 1901 there "were four great
world states, Russia, Great Britain, the United States
and Germany," the supposed reviewer of 2001 says:
"In our day the United States, with her 400,000,000 of
white inhabitants, is beyond comparison the most
powerful of nations. * * * Her navy is superior
to the combined fleets of Germany and Russia. New
York has become the world's financial center, and the
development .of the Pacific seaboard has been one of
the greatest marvels of the century. * * * Amer
ica's greatest rival is Russia, which, leaving out of ac
count the Eastern races, possesses a white population
of over 400,000,000. The industrial development of
Russia,' though not so rapid" as that of the States, has
been wonderful enough, and her military supremacy
is beyond question." '
Up to that point the account of the nations in 2001
is not essentially different from what would be made
by an intelligent American, but here is a new, proposi
tion: "The events connected with the establishment
of the German confederated republics in SouthAmer
ica led to much ill-feeling between the United States
and Germany, but their relations with our own coun
try have continued to be excellent, : and for the last
half century a kind of informal Anglo-Saxon alliance
has existed, founded upon the preference given to
goods and the declarations' of our Govern
ment'in support of the Monroe doctrine."
It is to be borne in mind that Scarborough t is
mtinly noted as a seaside resort. The people are
never thoroughly serious" even- when most so.' arid
consequently, this picture of a, Germanized South
America organized as a confederated . republic and
protected: by the Monroe doctrine, supported : by
A CENTURY FORECAST.
That is certainly an excellent showing for the re
public. It reveals the fact that France has entered
upon the. new century with bright prospects, ahead of
her. If now her statesmen can avoid a jingo policy of
expansion in Africa and China, or other schemes that
would entail wars and expense, the .heavy burdens her
people have beep carrying, would soon be materially
lightened. It would be curious if the lesson of econ
omy taught the French by the hard experience of the
nineteenth century should enable them to become
one of the niost lightly taxed of nations in the twen
tieth, while people .who are now lightly burdened
should by lack of economic teaching rush into expen
ditures that will place them within fifty years where
France has been ever since the collapse of the em
pire. .*:-Â¦
Coming to the details of the subject the Minister is
reported to have stated that the deficit of 198,000,000
francs caused by the incorporation of the special mili
tary budget with the ordinary, budget would be partly
met* by the sale of national property, yielding 15,000,
<xx> or 20,000,000 francs, and by that of the fortifica
tions of Paris, which would produce about 150,000,000
francs. The floating debt was reduced every year, and
a first step had been taken for the reduction of the
permanent debt of twenty- two milliards. In five years
Ithat debt would be automatically reduced by 500,000,
000 francs. :... ". 'â¢'.'*>
The facts were brought out in a recent debate in ths
Chamber of Deputies, when the Minister of Finance
in replying to a question concerning the expenditures
of the Government stated that the comparative in
crease of expenditures in France of late years has
been less than that of any other nation. He is quoted
as saying that in Great Britain the increase has been
per cent in eleven years, while in France it has
bten but 5 per cent. Â¦ *
ONE of the unexpected things'of the time is the
appearance of France in the role of a nation
practicing economy in all departments of ad
ministration and actually getting ready to begin pay
ing off her vast burden of debt.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
of full value the law means that the Government shall
be prepared to pay $20 to any citizen for $9 20 worth
of silver coined into dollars, with a nominal, not ac
tual, value of $20.
Up to this time, however, the law has not provided
for" the interchanging of silver and gold coins, which
is necessary tr> discharge the Government's obliga
tion to keep ?.I1 its currency at a parity. This is to be
effected by the Overstreet .or Hill bills, which have
the same object and do not differ materially in the
method of reaching it. Mr. Shafroth affects to sec in
this the forging of another "endless chain" for de
pleting the gold reserve. But he forgets that it was
not the gold redemption of the greenbacks, but their
immediate reissue to be redeemed again, that com
pleted the endless chain. There is no such legal re
quirement in the case of silver or silver certificates,
and any attempt to make such use of them is therefore
easily frustrated by the treasury.
As for the general policy of treating silver dollars
as a promise to pay, the gold standard people are not
responsible for that. It is part of the small tinkering
that went on from 1878 to 1893. The load of depre
ciated silver was dumped upon the treasury by the sil
ver standard people, and if they had had their.way we
would now be upon a silver-Dasis, running to ruin
with $=00,000,000 in silver worth and with a purchas
: :ng power of less than half its face, and every green
back and national bank dollar of necessity worth less
than half its face, for there would be no standard ex
cept the 46 cent silver dollar in which to redeem it. Â¦
REPRESENTATIVE SHAFROTH of Colo
rado has made the minority report of the Com
mittee on Coinage, Weights and Measures
against the principle of the Overstreet and Hill bills
to complete the gold standard legislation.
This minority report restates the whole free silver
position and follows closely Bryan's editorial on the
subject in Iris newspaper. Mr. Shafroth overlooks not
only the scientific features of the situation, but its
practical facts. He seems, like Bryan, to think that our
silver dollar currency is now in the same position as
our gold, coinage, and that is the fundamental mistake
in the whole contention made by that financial school.
Our gold coins are composed of a definite amount
of personal property called gold, a substance made
of univcr?al value by human desire, which is the only
source of value. A gold coin when it leaves the mint
contains exactly the value in that metal which is
stamped upon its face. In a five-dollar gold piece is
put five dollars' worth of gold, and in an eagle there
is ten dollars' worth, and in a double eagle twenty
collars' worth. When these coins come from the
mint they may be melted in the fire, or be hammered
out of shape, with every image, letter and legend
obliterated, but they lose no value, for the metal in
them is not lost nor its weight reduced by changing
their shape from coins to melted or hammered bu?
lion. They pass from hand to hand as property not
by their nominal value, but by their weight, which
fixes the amount of property called gold which .they
contain. The Government itself receives them by
weight only, snd provides by law that when abrasion
has reduced their weight below the limit of tolerance
they shall cease to pass at the full value they had on
leaving the mint, and thereafter they pass only for
the value shown by their weight. It is a daily ex
perience at the Custom-house, Sub-Treasury and
Internal Revenue Office to see the Government
weigh gold coins offered in payment of its claims, to
make sure that it is getting the proper quantity of
picperty in payment of taxes and liens.
With the silver dollar the case is different. It is
nominally a dollar, but actually contains only 46 cents'
worth of property called silver. In five silver dollars
there is only $2 30 worth of property; in ten such
dollars there is only $4 60 of value, and in twenty of
them only $9 20. They are not taken by weight.
The law obligates the Government to maintain al!
of its currency at an equality. As the gold coins are

Upon that showing there seems no possible objec
tion to the system on the score of cost. There is an
abundant supply of oil in California for sprinkling
purposes, and if the use of it become general it is
probable that with the improvements in the methods
of using that will surely result from long continued
experiments it will go far toward solving some of the
hardest problems that confront us in tfie task of pro r
vidihg throughout the State good streets and good
highways. . yj _;Jr\.S v
Upon the economic side of the question Mr. Brock
said, "We believe it cheaper than water." In reply
to a question as to how often the sprinkling was re
peated he said, 'Three times a year will keep the dust
do*n."- The material used he went on to say: "Is
a poor grade of oil with an asphaltum base. The
price of it is varied, the first we bought being $i a
barrel, and now it is $i 25." He added: "Another
thing I would like to mention is that we. have no dif
ficulty at all in collecting from the property-owners
two cents a foot on each side of the street, while the
total cost is eight cents a foot."
A system of street sprinkling that> not only lays
the dust of summer but serves to protect the road
beds during the wet weather of winter is certainly a
desirable system for communities that are unable to
afford asphalt or other good systems of street paving.
The two things from which the State suffers most
along the 'highways are dust and mud,* and if both
of them can be largely eliminated by the simple
process of sprinkling with oil, the task of street' and
highway improvement will be a comparatively simple
one.
Redlands has been using oil upon her streets for
two years, and , in commenting upon it Mr. Brock
said: "We. have found it a great success. It has, in
fact, settled the question of dust with us. Two years
ago, when we adopted the plan, water was very scarce,
and that moved us to try the experiment of using oil.
We have not a single complaint from any person in
the town in regard to the use of oil. It has satisfied
everybody much better than water, and what is ons
of the best features of it is that -when the rainy* sea
son comes it protects our roads and keeps them in
better condition than would otherwise be the case by
putting a coating upon the streets. One objection
that was raised to it was its getting on ladies' dresses
and on bicycles, but all of those objections have been
practically settled. There is nothing whatever detri
mental in the use of oil upon the streets, and the more
we use it the more we think of it. There is no doubt
we will continue to use it instead of water."

Among the more instructive articles published in the

Redlands. It is short and does not give all the de
tails necessary for a full understanding of the sub
ject, but it none the less serves the very useful pur
pose of directing attention to the. success that may
be attained in street and road improvement by the
use of oil. â¢ -

In this aspect the coming inquiry takes on a rnori
serious feature. . It is not an idle' investigation, with
no power behind it to remedy the evils it may dis
close. The State of California creates municipalities,
and they are not superior to their creator. The peace
and morals of all the people, their protection in per
son and property, are the concerns of the State, and
its power does not cease at the boundary of a city.
Under the mayoralty of Fernando Wood, in New
York City, there was alleged a condition such as is
charged here, and the State of New York met it by
the Metropolitan Police Commission, the creation of
State law. When the prohibitory law of Massachu
setts was disregarded by the police of the cities- of that
commonwealth, a State constabulary was created by
the Legislature to enforce it.
It would then be entirely competent for the Legis
lature, in the exercise of the police power of the State,
to provide a force of State constabulary as large as
the city police force, charged with the enforcement
of the State law against gambling, lotteries and the
other vices which it is charged are now overlooked by
the local government. For instance, if the alleged
desire of the Mayor and of the Police Commission
to get public revenue out of a wide-open Chinatown
were, carried out, a State constabulary would take the
place. of the police and close the wide-open district.
Now on the line of this investigation there runs a
State statute, parallel to every city ordinance, against
the public offenses that will be inquired into. If the
inquiry demonstrate that these offenses go ' unpun
ished, and that the charter officers, who should en
force the law against them, are in lucrative partner
ship with those who commit them, the power of the
State in the premises will appear.
Looking on that siJe of the matter there is no ap
pearance of utility in the proposed inquiry. But, after
all, the city is not independent of the State. The city
government is not charged with the enforcement of
its own criminal ordinances alone, but must also up
hold the criminal laws of the State. There are State
statutes of arson, burglary and murder, and when the
servants of the city government arrest for any of
those felonies they act under the State law. If they
refuse to arrest for arson, burglary and murder, shall
it be said that there is an open season in this city for
the offenses that are winked at? Shall it be said that
the State of California cannot enforce its criminal
l.iws because the charter officers of San Francisco.re
fuse to act? Such a condition of things is unthink
able. In such a state of things the State would by its
own instrumentalities enforce its laws within this
municipality.
No doubt the decision to make the inquiry was in
fluenced by the peculiar position assumed by the
Mayor "and the Police Commission, who arc credited
with desiring to derive public revenue out of a wide
open Chinatown. At the first glance the investiga
tion seems futile because of lack of power to act. The
charter does not give to the Legislature, nor the
Governor, nor any State authority, the right to re
move the Mayor, or the Pp.lice Commission, or any
officer holding under the city charter. From that
point of view an investigation could only result in
an exposure or a vindication of the local govern
ment. The State cannot compel the city government
to enforce its own ordinances. It may safely let them
become a dead letter, and the State is powerless.
Therefore, it is asked, why investigate at all? It is
expensive. It may prolong the session. It may re
veal a state of things injurious to the repute of this
city without disclosing any means of remedy.
â¢"p 1 HERE is a gr^at variety of opinion- about th*
1 proposed investigation of the alleged partner

The great figure of Betterton towers
head and shoulders above the crowd of
actors who sprang upon the stage when
the Restoration threw open the doors of
the long-closed theaters. His excellence
In his profession, his fine critical taste and
his. high character raised him to thÂ»
highest position ever held -by an English
actor.. He was befriended by two mon
archs, and Charles II lent him his corona
tion robes to play a kingly part in. Dry
den allowed him a free hand in pruning
his plays for the sÂ»ge; Bishop Tillotson
received him as a<suest at his table, and
he became the father and lnsKuctor of a
new generation of actors. Yet he sprang
from the humblest rank. His father had
been an under-cook In the household of
Charles I, and as a boy he was appren
ticed to a bookseller. But this bookseller
had once been tho keeper- of the ward
robe at tho Blackfriars Theater, and his"
tales of past glories, flredthe young. ap
prentice with emulative ambition. He ap
peared on the stage . even : before the
Restoration, and shortlyiafter that event
joined the company of Sir William Dave

maining links with the golden age of the
aters. He had. seen Taylor play the part

William Kemp was the leading comedian
of Shakcspcare"s company. He succeeded
Tarleton. the Yorlck of Hamlet's eulogy,
as the darling- clown of the laughter-lov
ing public. "That most comical Cavaliero,
M. du Kcmpe." a pamphleteer of the day
calls him. "jest-monger and vlceregent
general to the shost of Dick Tarleton."
He -was a famous dancer of jigs and
singer of comic songs; but his- fame rested
chiefly on his extempore "gags." This
practice must have been most offensive to
the careful art of Shakespeare, and we
lind him attacking It severely in Hamlet's
address to the players. "Let those that
play your. clowns," says the prince, voic
ing no doubt the wrath of Shakespeare
over many an Impertinent Intrusion, "speak
no more than Is set down for them; for
there .be of them that will themselves
laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too, â¢ though ia the
meantime some neceaaary question of the
play be then to be considered; that's vil
lainous. and shows a most pitiful ambition
In the fool that uses it."
We know that Kemp played before Eliz
abeth with Shakespeare and Burbape In
"two several comedies" on St. Stephen's
day and Innocents' day of 1594. What the
plays wÂ«re we have no means of know
ing. Perhaps ore or both were early cem
edles of Shakespeare. Kemp was the orig
inal Peter In "Romeo and Juliet" and the
original Dogberry In "Much Ado About
Nothing." These are th'e only parts which
can be positively assigned to him.

"he's fat and scant of breath," are gen
erally supposed to refer to Burbage's
portly figure. His greatest success, how
ever. Is said to have been attained In his
impersonation of Othello.
Burbage had some talent for painting,
and It has been conjectured, though with
out sufficient evidence to warrant its as
sertion as a fact, that the engraving of
Shakespeare prefixed to the first folio wa^
taken from a portrait of the poet by his
friend. â¢ '
It was during the argument that Attor

heart of a rich lady of London, who In

Shakespeare's hands and he availed him

But this practical joke made no breach
In their friendship. To the end of Shake

death he received from his executors the

DAVID GARRICK, THE GREAT
EST OF ALL ENGLISH ACT
ORS.
Richard Burbage is the first of the great
Shakespearean tragic actors. His one con
temporary rival in tragedy. Edward Al
leyne, seems to have devoted -himself
rather to the performance of the great
parts of Marlowe's plays. Faustus, the
Jew of Malta and Tamburlalne. But
Burbage was associated with Shakespeare
from the beginning. He was the son of
James Burbage, the builder of "the Thea
ter," and from his early years a member
of that company of actors which Shake
speare joined and for which all his great
plays were written. In fact, Burbage may
be said to have created all Shakespeare's
great tragic rolea. He had already dis
tinguished himself by his performance of
Kyd's "Jeronimo." but he eclipsed all
earlier performances by his representa
tion of "Richard III." His fame in this
character became, Indeed, national; the
very landlord at Leicester, relating the
incidents of Bosworth Field, confused the
identities of Richard and the great actor
who represented him. An amusing bit of
Shakespeare's Contemporaries.
There can hardly be a more Interesting

of Hamlet, and he carefully Instructed his
young protege In the old tradition until
he became a past master in this part.
Pepys, who loved him above all actors ol
his time, spoke of him as "a very sober,
serious man, and studious and humble,
following of his studies, and rich already
with what- he gets and saves." Pepya
calls him repeatedly the best actor In the
world and declares that his Hamlet was
"beyond imagination," "the best part that
MR. MACKLIN. THE "WILD
IRISHMAN. FAMOUS FOR HIS
SHYLOCK.*
ever man acted." This, In fact, was the-
Judgment of all who saw him, In Shakes-
peare's masterpiece.
The ' last great actor of Betterton's
school was the famous wit and epicure,
James Quin. He acted a number of,
Shakespearean characters â Brutus, Leax.
Richard and Macbeth, most of them in
the abominably mangled versions that had
usurped the boards since the Restora
tion. Qum's slow, artificial delivery and
calculated gravity of gesture were all
of the old "heroic" type, accepted for a
time as correct because conventional, but
soon rejected when Garrick arose as the
exponent of realism in acting. Strange
ly enough the only part by which Quin'3
memory lives to-day Is the one part
which he never needed to act. because
he was the characterâ Falstaff incarnate.
Â¦His own zest In life, conscious Importance
and flashing wit made the part second na
ture to him. "With a bottle of wine,"
says one who knew him well, "and a full
house, Quin the Instant he was on tha
stage, was Falstaft himself."
His contemporary', Macklln, "the wild
Irishman," is, like Quirt, famous for one
great Impersonation, that of Shylock. For
nearly forty years Shakespeare's play
had been banished from the stage and its
place taken by a miserable travesty, "The
Jew of Venice," by Lord Lansdowne. In
which Shylock was degraded Into . a
comic character. Macklln had the dar
ing to revive the old play and to perform
Shylock in the true tragic vein. The suc
cess of his first performance was prodi
gious. The house was In an uproar of aj>
pJause and the gTeenroom was crowded
with congratulating members of the no
bility.
"By G , sir,", said MackHn, recount
ing, years afterward the glories of the
great event, "let me tell you I waa
Charles the Great that night." PopÂ© com
plimented him on his performance, and
is said to have composed for him the ex
tempore epitaph:
X' .'Â¦ That Shakespeare drew
' This is the Jew.
Bollngbroke presented him a purse of
twenty guineas, and George II. casting
about for some expedient to frighten &
refractory House of Commons, proposed
sending them in a body to the theater "to
see that Irishman play Shylock." Mack
lin continued to act Shylock to the end of '
his Ion? life. He appeared In the char
acter for tne last time when over 90 years
of age, broke down completely, stepped
forward to the footlights, with. a. " pro-"**
longed apology to the audience, and aban
doned the stage.

Princeton University will be concluded to

Garrick.
The greatest of all English actors. Da
vid Garrick. made his appearance on the
stage In the sane year that MackIIn'3
Shylock proclaimed the new era of acting:.
Originally destined for the wine trade.
Garrlck's love of the stage* led him to
neglect his business. .He took part in
many amateur performances, appeared
under an assumed name In the provinces,
and finally, after trying 1 In vain to secure
an engagement at either of the regular
theaters of London, made his debut at el
little playhouse in the suburbs between
two parts of, a concert. Tho role he had
chosen was that of Richard III. and his
acting was a perfect revelation to the
audience. His wonderful voice, touching
all the stops of expression with perfect
realism and truth, the utter absence of
the conventional singsong, the perfect
identification of the actor with the char
acter he -was portraying, the thousand lit
tle touches of "business" which aerved
to complete the Illusionâ all these were
new and enthralling to a generation which
was wearied of the solenfh declamation
and labored gestures of the so-called
classical actors. "We are all wrong 1 If
this man Is right," said Quln, the chief
representative of* the old school, and after
a fierce rivalry with the newcomer, the
veteran was forced to admit his suprem
acy. Pope, who had "almost abandoned
the theater, was drawn from his retire
ment by the reports of Garrlck's wonder
fui performances, and after seeing him
as Kichard declared that he never had
an etiual and would never have a rival.
One part succeeded another with amaz
ing rapidity. Lear and Hamlet, two of
his very greatest roles, were added to hUÂ»
repertory in the first year, and In each he
was pronounced incomparable.
"He could act a gridiron," cried Jealous
Mrs. Cllve as she turned away In a flood
of "tears from -watching Garrlck's imper
sonation of the mad old king. LJchten
berg, an accomplished German critic, has
left a minute account of his Hamlet,
which seems to have been particularly
distinguished by Its versatility, realism
and harmonious ease. He attempted
Othello, but was never very successful In
the part. He revived the true Macbeth,
which had'been crowded off the stage fcy
Davenant's revision, and thrilled tho
world with tho mingled horror and mel
ancholy of his impersonation. His best
character In Shakespearean comedy wai
Benedick, a delightfully airy and refined
performance.
Garrick was a little man, and In conse
quence he did not excel in characters
where a stately present* was a requisite.
But he had a voice and a fade that were
almost perfect Instruments in renderirff
his conception,of a character. His tont*
was clear, impressive and affecting, forc
ible In declamation, unaffectedly simple In
vflriatlon. Ills eyes were black and pierc
ing, but he could make them as "dull as
codJled gooseberries." to express tha
stupid lethargy of a clown. His play of
facial expression was the wonder of tÂ»a
age." A deaf and dumb painter, who Ac t
tended every possible performar.ee of Gar-"
rick's, declared that he understood him,
perfectly, for his face was a language In.
itself. Not only his face, but his whole
body, acted; the very sklrt3 of his coat,
said Dr. Burney, seemed alive. He was
a perfect mimic, but he^was much more
than that. He was a true lover of hla art
and achieved his success quite as much
by his mental aa by his physical gifts. Ha
was a constant, if not a very profound,
student of Shakespeare, and did something
to restore the true version of his dramas,
and much, to reawaken a proper apprecia
tion of them as plays written for tho
stage and best understood when seen In
action.
Special Quarantine Sleeting.
An Impromptu meeting will be held In

three quarantine bills now before the> up-"
per house. The merchants of San Fran

to their passage, as they feel that they,
will cause a needless expense to the State.

The husband and Â¦ daughter of Mrs.

1 in other portions of the list when the force of
the selling movement had expended Itself
and thereby the steel stocks were an Im
portant influence on tne market. Buying was
credited to insiders and there was a recur
rence of recent rumors of a .coming wholesale
consolidation of the great corporations In the
trade. The opening r>se In the Southwesterns
wi,s not fo well maintained, although Mis
souri Pacific made a strong recovery later,
rising to S1 T *. and the Wabash securities were
very largely bought. It was rumored that
Chicago and Eastern Illinois had passed to the
control of the Mipg^iuri Pax^iflc or the St. Louis
Southwf-ftern and the lately prevalent rumors
of a general consolidation of the Southwestern
railway systems still retained their force in
the spt-cuJation. Chicago and Eastern Illinois
rose Â£>4, and the preferred 1V4- A spurt of 3%
In Tobacco about midday was a feature. There
were a very large number of stocks of smaller
railroads v.hich advanced sharply under the
prevailing Impression that absorption of such
roads by the larger lailway systems is the
order or the day. Hocklntr Valley rose 4H.
Hocking Valley preferred 3Vi. Pere Marquette
5. Minneapolis and St. Louis 2V?. Evansvilje
and Terre Haute 5. Lake Erie and Western 2,
and quite an extended list from 1 to 2 points.
In the later dealings, when the coalers and
Pennsylvania developed sudden and aggressive
strength, after showing symptoms of heaviness
earlier In the day on a statement that the
dividend In Reading tint preferred would not
be increased for the present. The movement
Feemed to be based on rumors as to the ! dis
position of Lehigh Valley, different reports as
signing it to Lackawanna. Reading and Erie.
Gains in the list were 3Â»-i for Lackawanna. 3
for Delaware and Hudson, from 1 to 2 for
other members of the group. The movement
In Pennsylvania was not explained, but It
resulted in an advance cf + points. Union Pa
cific and Southern Pacific also succeeded In
throwing oft* their depression, the former ad
vancing to 91 and the latter to 4S. through
heavy offerings in boih cases. A flurry to 3
per cent In the call money rate was not much
heeded although lt calls attention to the fact
that last week's enormous incursion into the
rÂ»B?rve forces by reason of the loan expansion
of over $30,000,000 was a reality to be reckoned
with. The reaction In sterling exchange and
the Impression of an outward gold movement
to London is averted for the present.
The absorption of middle and lower grade
bends continued very heavy and at advancing
prices. Total sales, par value, 17,710,000.

NEW YORK, Feb. 5.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's Lonrtcp financial cablegram says:
Though business* on the Stock Exchange here
was restricted to-day the tone was cheerful
and prices were pretty strong. The American
department attracted the most Interest and the
market for its shares was strong throughout
in Fpite of the fact that business was greatly
Influenced for three hours by interruption of
the cable. This was due to storm. Buying
was free. The Erie shares and the Atchisons
ware In great demand. There was some selling
to realize In the Southern and Union Pacific
issues. Berlin was buying Canadian Pacific
all day. nar gold to the extent of Â£48,000 was
bought by the bank. Money was easier.
Opinion here Is divided on the question of the
reduction of the bank rate, although advices
that gold will soon arrive from â¢ New York
strengthen the expectation of a cut.

Sbip Sunk to Save Her.
Water In some unknown manner came
Into contact last night with the quicklime
which formed the principal part of the
cargo of the steamship South Portlani,
which is lying at division No. 2 of the
seawall, and converted the forward hold
of the vessel into a caldron of boiling
liquid. How the wtter reached the lime
is a complete mystery. When it was flrtt
discovered by the watchman dense vol
umes of vapor were pouring out of the
ship's hold. An alarm was immediately
turned in and two engines responded.
They were powerless to do anything to
chÂ«.ck the destruction of the cargo. The
only course open was to sink thd vessel
and thus burn the lime as quickly as pos
sible. The Governor Irwin was called
into service and three streams of water
were turned into the hold of the vessel
until she rested upon the bottom.
The South Portland arrived only a few
days ago from Fort Roche. The cargo- of
lime was consigned to Davis & Crowel of
this city and part of it had been removed.
The greatest damage will result not from
the -loss of the lime but from the Injury
which the vessel sustained in being sunk.
Captain Charle3 Hall is in charge of the
steamship.

The decision of Police Judge Smith,
holding B. Bercovich guilty of conducting
& gambling game in keeping a nickel-ln
the-slot machine on his counters, 'was re
versed by a jury in Judge Greene's court
to-da}\
Bercovich was arrested under the city
ordinance prohibiting the operation of the
slot machir.es. Judge Â£mith tried the
case and found bertovich guilty. The
case, which was made as a test by the
cigar dealers, was appealed to the Supe
rior Court. Judge Oreeiie reversed the
decision of tJie loÂ»Â«r court and ordered a
new trial, which occurred to-day in his
department, with the result noted.
In his opinion reversing Judge Smith's
decision Judge Greene held that machines
Â¦which puarai-.teed the player against loss
were not gambling devices according to
the definition of the State Supreme
Â« uiirt. This ruling of the California court
has t-een. said his Honor, severely criti
cised by the United States Supreme Court,
but nevertheless must dictate the courst^
< f county courts in this State. It holds
ihat where a gambling device is merely
a. side issue and not the main business in
any transaction ft does not come within
the scope of the law forbidding gambling.
On the strength of this decision of Judge
Greene's the cigar dealers at once re
turned business with the slot machines.
In his charge to the jury in to-day's re
hearing of the case his honor pointed out
that in this particular Instance a dealer
Â¦was arrested for allowirg a customer to
rlay a dollar apainst the machine, which
guarantees eight '"bit" cigars for every
<Jo'.lar played.
The evidence showed that the right
cigars given the customer were rurh as
were sold for a dollar over the counter
at Bercovirh'5 and other cigar stores,
liad the cigars been worth on the market
ninety-nine rents. said. Judge Greene, the
machine would have been illegal, â¢
As a practical matter, his Honor re
marked, it was hard to see how a man
<-ould keep on doing- business where he
was obliged to pay all the way from eight
to 2000 bit cigars for a dollar, but accord

"How can you doubt my good faith," he

This is the order for suicide. Afterward

NEW YORK. Feb. B.â The Tribune will
say to-morrow: Negotiations for ,the sale
of Andrew Carnegie's controlling interest
in the stock of the Carnegie Company
were brought to a successful conclusion
on Monday, J. Pierpont Morgan and his
associates being the purchasers. The
terms of the transaction cannot at- this
time be announced, but the transaction is
a colossal one, rivaling the recent change
of control of the Southern Pacific when
that property passed Into the hands of
the Union Pacific interests. Mr. Carnegie
held nearly 54 per cent of the $160,000,000
stock of the Carnegie Company. This
stock has not been listed on any stock ex
change, but $1500 was recently paid for a
$1000 share in the Carnegie Company.
Assuming that Mr. Carnegie has dis
posed of his holdings at par. he will re
ceive fully $S5.000.000 for his interest while
at the same time he will retain his 53 or
54 per cent interest in the $160,000,000 bond
issue of the Carnegie Company. The ob
ject aimed at by Mr. Morgan and the in
terests allied with him when treating with
Mr. Carnegie was the assurance of an en

believed to have been obtained.

The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children and the police of two
States are trying to recover the 2-year-old
child of George H. Springer, who keeps
a clothing store at 796 Folsom street, j The
little girl has been away from. Its parents
for the past year and is said. to be in the
custody of A. M. Coleman, a milkman,
who lived at one time at 139 Earl street.
Secretary White of the local Children's
Society says that every effort has been
made by the distracted father to gain pos
session of his" offspring, but he has been
repeatedly foiled by Coleman, who leaves
town as soon as his presence becomes
known to the police.
It appears that in March last, Springer,
who was a- well-to-do merchant of this
city, lost his business through the con
tinued illness of his wife. The support of.
his three children at that time became a
difficult matter for him. He therefore ad
vertised for a good family to take care
of his youngest offspring, and in answer
to his inquiry Coleman orfered to take the
little one. The child was turned over to
Coleman with the understanding that if
Springer was convinced that his little one
had found a suitable home he would allow
the Colemans to adopt it legally.
Mr. Springer learned from the neigh
bors that Coleman was a drinking man
and he decided to take the child away.
He notified the Colemans on May 13 of his
intended action and when he called the
following day he was greatly surprised to
learn that Coleman had sold his furniture
and departed to parts unknown.
Springer went to the Police Court and
pwore to a warrant for the arrest of Cole
man for kidnaping. Â¦ Coleman was traced
from this city to Stockton, thence to Sac
ramento and when the police were about
to take him into custody he slipped away
to Clackamas, Or. Some months later
Springer ascertained that Coleman was
working in Portland, Oregon, but when ho
Investigated his man had again disap
peared.
No further tidings were heard of the
Colemans until a few days ago, when
Springer accidentally learned that his
man was working in Fue, Crook County,
Oregon. lie immediately Informed the
local society and Secretary White sent
letters to the Sheriff and Children's So
ciety of Portland, Oregon.
Mr. Springer is a member of the famous
Springer family, which is now making' a
strong flght to recover fifty acres of land
in the center of Wilmington. Delaware,
which is now valued at $14,000,000.

THE DAY'S DEAD.
A COFFEE KILLING.
Some Can and Some Can't Drink It.
Some time apo Mr. K. Perclval Baker
was assigned by the Government to the
Chinese Bureau in San Francisco. He
Is a. Spanish and Chinese Interpreter, but
had become known as a distinctive case
cf coffee poisoning.
He finally gave up his position and went
to Los Ansjeles to die. He was carried
.to the train by the physician ahd at that
time weighed ninety-nine pounds.
What coffee poisoning can do for man
it is difficult to believe without some per-
por.al experience. He says, "The physi-
cian had told me that mine was a clear
rase of coffee poisoning, but I could not
jrive up the coffee. I had got so bad that I
could keep absolutely nothing on my
stomach for days- at a time. Dr. Hnyden
of this city said to me one day, "Have you
ever tried Postum Food Coffee?' 'Never
heard of it.' said I. He explained that it
was a food drink made at Battle Creek,
Mich., by the Tostum Cereal Co., Ltd.,
and as he said was 'destined to entirely
supplant coffee, at least with those who
have any regard for their health or lives.'
'"I was so impressed that before leaving
the office the -doctor forced me to promise
to give Postum a fair trial. Well, to
make a long story thort, wife made some
for me. and she made it "right, strictly
according to directions. I was served
with a delicious cup and half an hour
after sipping Jt was sleeping, the first six
hours of ? !crp cr unbroken rest I had had
for half a year.
"This v.as not caused Ly any drug in
the Posturn, for I know it to be absolutely
pure, but It was due to the quieting ef-
fect "of the liquid food on my stomach,
and food that 1 could digest. 1 persevered
in the use of Postum for a week, then I
thoucht I wou'.d try just one cup of cof-
fee, but did bo v.ith the result that my
etomach ri&Ir.s returned with such effect
as to require the doctor at my bedside
nearly all night. ) have never repeated
the experiment with coffee, for it showed
vrry plainly what it would do and has
dono for me If I fool w!th It.
"I have steadily improved In health
Elnce making the change, and now welch
US pounds, forty-nine pounds more than
I did, and am gaining at the rate of over
two pounds a week. I have had abso-
lutely no trouble since then with my
FlomscJi, and it Is over three months
since 1 have had a twinge of neuralgia or
headache, and I know that my cure is
entirely due to leaving off coffee and tak-
ing Postum Food Coffee. All of my friends
and the doctors are of the same opinion.
I Inclose a list of names of Government
f^ials at Â¦Washington and San Francisco
who are more or less familiar with the
case and will verify as far as they are
, able."

. land Jail on Complaint of
S. H. Williams.
OAKLAND, Feb. 5.-S. H. "Wllllairis,
superintendent of a syrup factory at
First street and Broadway, caused tho ar
rest to-day of A. Larrouy, a young French
laundryman. on a charge of attempted
blackmail. Williams claims that Larrouy
tried to extort money .from -him under
threat to expose an. assault he alleged
the syrup manufacturer had made upon
Marie Briehl, a 15^year-old servant girl,
who was until Sunday In Williams' em
ploy in Alameda. -:
Larrouy said: "I am employed at a
laundry at 1726 Polk street, San Fran
cisco. The girl is a sister to a young
woman whom I am Jo marry next month.
I was sent for by her friends because of
the story she told. about this man's con
duct. To-day I went to hls'offlcfe and de
manded an explanation from him. For
answer he summoned a couple of men,
who held me .while he sent for. a police
man and had me arrested. He lies when
he says I asked for money. What I
wanted was to hear him make some state
ment about why the girl ran away from
his house "last- Sunday."
Williams was seen at his residence In
Alameda to-night. He said:
Â¦ "This man demanded money and I had
him arrested. I refuse to talk about the
chanres. . The jfirl worked for me. but
she did not know anything. All the rest
of it will come out at the trial. I will
not say anything now to hurt my case."

ONE CHARGES ASSAULT,
THE OTHER BLACK2IAIL
GEORGETOWN. Ky.. Feb. 6.â Henry
B. Youtsey, convicted cf complicity In the
murder of Governor Gocbel, was sentenced
by Judge Cantrlll this afternoon and to
morrow will be taken to Frankfort to en
ter upon his term of lifo Imprisonment.
Youtsey was pale and weak when he
stood up to -receive thÂ» sentence of tha
court. His wife sat near by and heard
the stern sentence of the law consigning
her husband to the penitentiary for life,
but bore up under the ordeal bravely.
Briefly Judge Cantrill outlined the prog
ress of the case from the time of the in
dictment until the- reluming of tho ver
dict.
"Now," continued the Judce, "have you
any reason to give why sentence should
not be pronounced upon you?"
\"outsey shifted his position slightly and
cleared his throat. One hand clutched the
lapel of his coat, the other rested on th3
table. The courtroom was perfectly qul?t.
In*, a low but audible tone Youtsey spoko
thtse words: "I have nothing to say ex
copt that I am innocent and that my con
viction was accomplished only by basa
and Infamous subornation of perjury." .
Then he quietly sa: down. For a mo
ment no one spoke.
"That is a subject which you should
have addressed to th* jury which con
victed you," answered the Judge. "It is
the Judgment of this court that you be
removed by the Sheriff of Scott County
to the State Penitentiary at Frankfort
and there be confined at hard labor for tha
period of your natural life."
The case of Barbour Weaver, accused
of perjury in the Powers case, will go to
trial to-morrow.
Declares Sis Conviction Was Accom
plished Only by Subornation
of Perjury.

tho German cruiser Nymphe and the Brit
ish cruisers Niobe.and Minerva.
A number of German detectives cease

and boarded- the imperial train before It
started. Emperor William wore a British
field marshal's uniform and King Edward
and the Duke of Connaught wore the
German uniforms.
â¢ The Archbishop of York, Field Marshal
Earl Roberts, the Lord Mayor and many
distinguished people, including the mem
bers of the German Embassy and a num
ber of officers, gathered on the platform
to bid farewell to Emperor William. The

Investigators Are Conceded No Other
Power Than to Recommend New
Laws if Found Necessary.
At a meetine of the Board of Police
Commissioners last night Chairman New
hall opened a discussion on the present
investigation Into alleged corruption In
San Francisco police affairs by asking his
colleagues what right a committee ap
pointed by the Assembly at Sacramento
has to Institute an inquiry concerning
matters which come under the Police
Board's Jurisdiction. It finally was ex
pressed as the sentiment of the Commis
sioners that they recognized the authority
of the inquirers no more than that of a
body of citizens, except that they might
enact legislation which would tend to pre
vent a breach of the laws in future. As
a body cloaked with power to administer
punishment to any member or members
of the department they might find guilty,
no such power exists.
Respecting the right of the committee
to inquire into police affairs simply for
information that might be conducive to
POLICE COMMISSIONERS
DISCUSS THE INQUIRY
fleers could do the work as well."
Shadows of Official Blackmail.
"Pld you ever Investigate any charges
of corruption against your ofllcers?"
"I have not."
"Did you ever hear of any charges of
blackmail against any of your officers?"
"I have not."
-"Did you ever hear. of any one of your
officers accepting money?"
"I never did."
Then again the current of the Inquiry
was changed. Now and again Chief Sulli
van made sharp answers, but nothing else
Indicated that he. was anything but even
tempered. He explained his reasons for
placing houses of ill-fame above the first
story, saying that it lessened the evil and
did not increase It, as was suggested.
Then came one of the critical questions
and answers of the entire session. -
''Who suggested the policy to license
gambling and houses of prostitution in
Chinatown?" asked Webber.
"Mayor Phelan," was the startling an
swer.
"What did he say?"
â¢"He can tell best for himself."
"I want you to tell."
'Â¦He declared that gambling and other
evils in Chinatown are extremely difficult
to suppress and will require too large a
force to do so, and that the best plan
would be to license these places and col
lect a revenue from them, under forms
of law, every month. This was the plan
suggested by Mayor Phelan to the com
mission and myself. We all indorsed the
plan, and so did the newspapers, all
agreeing to give it a trial. All papers
agreed to this, the Examiner objecting,
however, to the gambling phase."
"Was the plan agreeable, to the Police
Commision?
"The commission agreed to take it un
der advisement and if It were agreeable
to adopt It."
"What ideas have you now for the sup
pression of gambling?"
"I would suggest that 6ome penal legis
lation be enacted to change the method
by which doors are constructed. If we
could force these clubs to have lighter
doors we could better enforce the law."
The examination of the Chief then be
came rambling. Question after question
was asked, but veiy little more than
opinions was elicited. The committee
learned all about the intricacies of Chi
nese gambling and were assured that no
white man In San Francisco patronizes
Chinese games.
"Do you mean to sit there and tell me
that you do not know that white men pa
tronize Chinese gambling games in this
city?" asked Webber, threateningly.
"I mean to sit here and tell you that I
do not," replied the Chief, humbly.
The rest of the Inquiry was unim
portant and an adjournment, was taken
until this morning at 10 o'clock, when
Chief Sullivan was requested to be pres
ent.
Mayor Phelan will follow Chief of Po
lice Sullivan upon the witness stand and
it is expected that his testimony will be
extremely interesting. George Newhall,
president of the Police Commission, will
follow Mayor Phelan. ' *
the passing of good laws and to show to
the people that they do not fear the llgrht
of an Investigation, the Commissioners
passed a resolution, the text of which is
to furnish to the committee from tho As
sembly every facility for gaining tho In
formation it desired.
All of the Police Commissioners tooK
an active part In the discussion. Commis
sioner Mahoney argued that charges of
corruption. If any had been made, should
first be brought before them, and that
they are the only persons vested with the
right to take any final action. He read
a section of the charter relative to the
matter, and said that the law la clear on
that point. His colleagues coincided with
him. Mahoney also averred that the In
vestigation now In progress is proceeding
on public rumor, and not on any specific
charges. .
Chief Sullivan spoke concerning the dif
ficulties experienced in suppressing gam
bling, and told of the recommendations he
had made and would make to the legisla
tive committee for the enactment of better
laws. Beyond an expression of Individual
opinion on the subject and the passing of
the resolution no further action was taken
and the board adjourned early.
THE Police Department of this city
has been p'.aceJ most seriously on
the defensive. Its motives have
been impugned, its methods have
been, criticized, its accomp'.lsh
rnenti: have been questioned and. in th*
mouth of its chief representative, its ad
ministration has been clamped as a fail
ure. The investigation of local police af
fairs, particularly in reference to thÂ«*
conduct of the department toward Chinese
â¢ramblers and other coolie offenders, was
commenced yesterdav afternoon and al
ready enough cf wriOOs moment has been
developed to give cautt for grave appre
hension.
The Inquiry took a wide latitude frcm
the start. Chief of PoUce William P. Sul
livan Jr. was the only witness on thtÂ»
f.f.-ii during the afternoon, but for nearly
two hours he was subjected to a mu.st
tcrutiniiing examination. He answered
all questions frankly, candidly and with
out reservation even when his replies in
volved him in Inconsistencies and an ex
pose cf the operations of public officiate
whom, it wils expected, he might seek to
shield.
The admissions of Chief cf Police Sulli
van. Fupposodly preliminary to the main
purpose of the inquiry, were startling in
their candor. He declared that when ho
sought the position of Chief of Police tip
possessed no knowledge, except a casual
one, cf police duties; ;hat he knew noth
ing of police administration or of Its ob
ligations and that his only motive In ask
ing and laborirp for tv.e position was the
bait of a higher salary. He was at the
time in receipt of a certain income as the
private secretary oX Mayor Phelan ancl
the position of Chief ol Police offered a
higher one.
When Mayor Phe'.an agreed to increase
the salary of his secretary Chiaf SulHvan
declared that he'was willing to remain a
secretary. But the deal came and William
P. Sullivan Jr. became Chief of Police.
He swore yesterday that he entered upon
his duties with no more Knowledge of
them than a belief that h'.s experience of
sixteen years in the National Guard qual
ified him to control and discipline men
and that his' friends, the" officers of the
Police Department and the Police Com
mission would cuidc him to an under
standing: of his duties as Chief of Po-
Uce. .'
Phslan Is Bcsponsible.
With this introduction Chief of Police
Sullivan was led Into a discussion of thÂ«;
primary theme of the Inquiry. He was
asked to tyll what he knows of Chinese
rambling and of coo'.Ie social vice, and to
describe- supplemental;)* to a history of
both the scheme- through which coolie
gambling and Immorality were to be leg
alized and made feeders of municipal rev
enue.
Chief of Police Sullivan declared unhesi
tatingly that the plan to license Chines?
gamblers and Chinese immoral women
and make thei*. under form of law, tribu
taries to the l^cal treasury was fathered
alone by Mayor Phelan, who suggested
it. urped it and practically forced it upon
the Police Department as a wise measure
of municipal policy. Mayor Phelan
showed what profit would accrue from
such licensing of dangerous and degrad
ing vice. He consulted with the Police
Commission, the District Attorney, the
Chtef of Police and officials of the depart
ment. Then, said Chief of Police Sullivan
yesterday. Mayor Phelan Insisted upon
the adoption of his plan to license vice
in the Chinese quarter. Upon the urging
of the Mayor, the Chief- testified, the
scheme was adopted blindly and followed
implicitly, until everybody concerned was
informed that it was obviously illegal. It
was then abandoned.
Mayor Phelan sat and listened yester
day to these frank admissions of the Chief
of Police. The Mayer was ill at ease, evi-
Oently in 111 humor and plainly displeased.
For the first time the public knew who
is responsible for the peculiar adminis
tration of police affairs in Chinatown.
Chief* Sullivan then attempted to explain
the internal administration of the police
in Chinatown and became Involved in in
consistencies and contradictions. He
made the remarkable assertion that he
does net believe that a single white man
in San Francisco is a victim of Chinese
grmbling or a patron of the games. His
description of police methods in the dis
trict is of extreme interest.
The inquiry besran promptly yesterday
at 2 o'clock In the afternoon In
the courtroom of Superior Judge Law
lor in the Hall â¢ of Justice. The
courtroom was. crowded. Among thÂ«Â»
earliest visitors to arrive was Police Com
missioner Newhall. Shortly after came
Moyor Phelan, his personal attorney, D.
Murphy, and his retainer,- Registrar
Walsh. Chief of Police Sullivan and Cap
tain Wittman occupied seats In a corner
and tried to look unconcerned. Before
the session was over Wittman's uncon

"I do not."
On the Track of Wittman.
thcrity of the committee, granted by the
Assembly, was read and Chief of Police
William P. Sullivan Jr. was called to the
witness stand. At this moment Attorney
Joseph Dunne, bristling with excitement,
arose and addressed the committee. Agi
tated observers thought he was about to
speak for the bubonic Board of Health,
but he only wanted to know if witnesses
might be represented by attorneys. He
was informed that no witness could have
an attorney and no attorney could ask a
question without first submitting it to the
committee for indorsement. Mr. Dunne,
duly suppressed, retired, and the inquiry
proceeded.
The vast majority of questions were
asked by Assemblymen Knowland and
Webber. Know-land made his inquiries
calmly, apparently with fairness and cer
tainly without prejudice. Webber, on the
contrary, excited considerable adverse
comment by badgering his witness, by
showing too evident signs of prejudice
against the Chief of Police and by treat
ing him as If he were guilty of some of
fense and was to be trapped. Undue en
thusiasm may perhaps explain Mr. "Web
ber's conduct.
At the very opening of the session a
fire of questions, designed to learn the
steps which accompanied his appointment,
was directed against the Chief. In reply
Chief Sullivan declared that Mayor Phe
lan did not want him to accept the posi
tion of Chief of Police, which had been
suggested by Ed Donnelly. When Don
nelly made this suggestion -to Mayor Phe
lan the latter consulted Sullivan, who said
that he was inclined to try for the place,
as it offered an increase, of salary over
that of the position which he then occu
pied, which was secretary to Mayor Phe
lan. ' ,}'* . â¢ â¢
Chief Sullivan declared that his primary
purpose in seeking the position of Chief
was this added emolument, but. Mayor
Phelan promised an increase and Sulli
van promised to remiin secretary. This,
however, he did not do. He accepted tho
position of Chief of Police, believing that
an experience of sixteen years in the Na
tional Guard, in the handling of men and
in. enforcing discipline gave him, qualifica
tions for the new position. He said. that
he felt it would be easy for him to learn
the duties of the place after he was
elected.
â¢ He knew nothing of the duties except in
a casual way, learned through his expe
rience as secretary to Mayor Phelan. He
expected, however, to' secure advice from
t*ie Police Commissioners and from offi
cers In the department. At this stage of
the inquiry an extremely significant and
important question was asked.
"Arrests have been made and raids con
ducted and prosecutions Instituted wher
ever it was possible, to make them. The
lf.rgest arrest ever | mad^ was of eighty
men, who pleaded guilty, and, according
to custom, were forced each to pay a fine
ot $5.'.'
Again the Inquisitors came back to
Wittman, tho scapegoat against whom
nothing, was Bald and ajrainst whom
everything was insinuated. The captain
lay back in his chair and rolled his eyes
heavenward. It is not the first time that
he has been under, the fire of accusation.
"Did Wittman have charge of tho
Chlntown squad?"
' "He did not.'.'
"Has he now?"
"There is no squad now. "We have taken
the squad out, "as it could not suppress
gambling."
"And still you believe there was no
corruption?" - . Â¦ : v
"I do."
"If you believed there .was no corruption
why did you want % to establish, a system
of criminal dues and license of crime?"
"Simply because- I, wanted to remove
even the suspicion of - corruption. News
papers were constantly: .making, allega
tions and I wanted to 'take away any ex
cuse for. these charges. I removed the
squads frequently because I wanted to re
lieve them from. temptation and also from
very hard work.'.',
"Why did you remove the squad alto
gether'?\
.."Because I believed that the regular of -

must be quick to get into these houses be
forethe evidence is destroyed."
"Do you know whether or not Wittman
knew how many gambling dens and
houses of Ill-fame there are In China
town?" '
"I do not." .. .
Then the inquiry veered and Chief Sulli
van was asked all about his office, but
nothing of importance was elicited.
"What have you done to suppress gam
bling and crime In Chinatown?"
Â¦"No.'- sir; .Mayor Phelan. always uses
very lino language." '
Wittman's Knowledge of Gambling.
"What was said?"
, "Mayor Phelan said the whole matter
must drop, as he would not tolerate a vio
lation of the law."
"Was no stronger language than that
used?"
"I did."
"They declared that they would enforce
the law."
"Yet you wanted to fix them In a
scheme to black'mail Chinese gamblers?"
"I do not consider that It was either
fixing or blackmail. The Police t Judges
have made similar arrangements with
Chinese offenders."
"Did you consult Chinese gamblers or
keepers of houses of ill fame on this
scheme?"
"I Â£ld not. Our plan was gradually to
Increase the monthly assessment until we
drove these people out of business."
"And they were to continue their busi
ness until then?"
"Certainly." .".
"Isn't It a fact that Captain Wittman
proposed this whole policy to you?"
*?It Is not a fact. He suggested some
Ideasâ not all of them."
"What did Wittman say?"
"I don't remember. I asked him in ref
erence to the levenue, and he gave me a
list of lottery games, gambling-houses and
houses of prostitution."
"Captain Wittman knew of all of
these?" >>
"He didâ and I gave the list to the Po
lice "Commission."
"What effort had Captain Wittman
made to suppress these places?" * ,
"He was constantly making arrests."
"What revenue was the city to get from
this policy?"
"Between $97,000 and $98,000 a year."
"Why did you abandon this policy?"
. "Because it v/as contrary to law."
"You went Into this thing blindly, as
far as the law. was concerned?"
"Yes, sir."
"Is that the proper way In which to con
duct the Police Department of this city?"
"It, was not carried into effect,- so no
harm was done."
.. "Did you have a conversation with
Mayor Phelan when it was discovered
that the proposed policy was in violation
of the law?"- -.Â¦ 'â¢Â¦'.' â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦
