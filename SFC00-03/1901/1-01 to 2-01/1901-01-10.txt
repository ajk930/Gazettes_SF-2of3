CHICAGO. Jan. 9.â Recollections of the
murder of Millionaire Amos J. Snell were
in all minds in Judge Tuthiirs court to
day, whin Mrs. Mary Snell-Stone began
her contest of the will of Mrs. Henrietta
Snell. Mrs. Stone, who was cut off from
the legacies by the will, declared it was
made while Mrs. Snell was of unsound

Attorney A. S. Trude. who appeared for
the defense, stated that Mrs. Stone was
not the daughter of ; A. J. Snell and had
no rights in the estate. He paid:

she was still considered one of them. Aft

CONTEST OF THE WILL
OF MRS. HENRIETTA SNELL
Afterward there became a difference be
tween Mrs. Snell and Mr. Stone, and this
will was made, in which Mrs. StonÂ« was
left out. The only allegations made
against Mrs. Snell as- to her sanity and
alleged use of profane language are made
by Willis W. Carland, now a convict In
Montana, who was for ten years employed
by Mr. Stone and also in the Snell family.
It will be shown that the acts of Mr?.
Snell, which are pointed to as evidences
of Insanity, were done, under the advice
of Carland."
The contest involves property valued nt
between J70O.0OO and $800,000. It is alleged
in the bill that Mrs. Snell was not of
sound mind when the will was drawn and
signed, and it is charged she was Igno

dead on the floor of one of his rooms In
his Washington-street residence. early one
morning in the spring of 18S8, with a re

of $50,000 for his arrest was offered by

LONDON, Jan. 9. â The Duke of
Norfolk has undoubtedly allowed
his religious enthusiasm to exceed
the bounds of prudence. Differ
ent versions are published of the
exact words which he used in his address
to the Pope yesterday on the occasion of
the I'ilgritnase to Rome of the leading
Engl!s-h Roman Catholics. According to
the K'xprrss and Mail, he expressed a
wish J or the restoration of the papal tem

merely prayed for that " position of~tem-~

declared necessary for the fulfillment of
the duties of his charge. In any case, the
refereiice to the temporal power was un
timely, for it is certain to wound the sus

MARSEILLES. Jan. 9.â Dispatches from
the village of Fararnan. near which the
French mail steamer Russie. from Oran.
Algeria, stranded Monday in a violent
storm with fifty passengers and a crew
of forty on board, tay that all effort* to
reach the steamer have failed, owing to
the tremendous height of the seas which
are running. The pilot boats and torpedo
boats which have attempted to reach the
steamer have been unable to battle with
the waves and have returned. The only
hope seems to be in the ability of the life
savers to throw a line over the Rusale, as
the wrecked vessel is driven closer to the
shore.
The forecastle and part of the forward
deck house are all of the vessel above
water. The beach was lined all night
with watchers.
The latest Information as to the Russie
indicates that the situation has not been
modified, but the outlook is distinctly
hopeful. The weather continues calm and
the vessels which are coming from Tou
lon to the assistance of the mail boat
will shortly be in sight of Cape Faraman.
Shortly after 2 o'clock, during a lull, the
men on shore succeeded In getting a lino
to the Russie, but it snapped as It wa.-Â»
being pulled on board. Other similar at
tempts failed, but a more hopeful feeling
prevails, in view of the indications that
the weather is clearing.

waves and affords a refuge. Otherwise it
is believed that all would have long since

WASHINGTON. Jan. S -The army can
teen is to bo aboli.-hÂ«-d. as the Senate to
day by a decisive vote concurred In the
public opinion relative to the army can
teen. Only fifteen votes could be mus
tered in the Senate in favor, while thirty
four were cast a?ji:ist it. Mcst of the
time lo-4ajr v.a? occupied by Teller, Pettl
grew and Butler, who all opposed the
adoption of the Senate committee's
ftmer.drror.t which provided for the con
tinuance of the caMeen. Beyond dispos
!rgr of the canteen question finally the
Senate has accomplished little and it
seems doubtful whether a final vote upon
the measure will be reported before Frl
cay or Saturday.
McCuxnber of Maryland, in a carefully
prepared argument, attacked the amend
ment and urged the adoption of the House
provision abolishing the canteen. He de
clared that a great majority of the deaths
in the army were due cither directly or
Indirectly to the u*~ of intoxicants.
Teller of Colorado said that no attack
vas being made upon the post exchange,
hut merely on the beer selling part of the
exchange. He declared his belief that the
canteen system was vicious and believed
that the great majority of the American
jieople held the same opinion. The Col
orado Sf-nator maintained that the exces
sive use of beer was one e>f the most de
grading phases of Intemperance. The
statement that the saloon interests was
back of the fight upon the canteen, he
f-Â£ld, was absurd.
"It is true, nevertheless,' interjected
Hawley of Connecticut.
"It :s r.ot true." retorted Teller, "and
the Senator cannot prove that It is true."
Reverting to the situation in the Phil
ippines, Teller declared that the United
Elates was cursing the people of those
Islands with a curse "as vicious and vile
as any the Spaniards ever placed upon
them."
Gai!!r.gcr said that he had been told by
r prominent army officer that the 400 or
hr*t American saloons in Manila were
licensed by the American Government,
h.r.Â£ be believed they could be completely
abolished.
"I do not know the reason for the con
oition in Manila," said Lodge, "but I do
know vhat under the command of General
Ludlow the establishment of saloons was
absolutely stopped in Havana."
"1 never heard any complaint of this
kind when I was in Havana last spring,"

BERLIN, Jan. 9.â The War Office has
received the following dispatch from
Count von Waldersee, dated Peking, Jan
uary 8:
"The fortress of HopoU. which was
stormed January 3, was the headquarters
of newly organized bands of Boxers. Over
a thousand had terrorized the district and
were planning to march on Yonklng: and

with Colonel Madais' column from Yen
king, seventy-two kilometer* northwest
of Peking.
"Colonel Pavel, after extremely severÂ©

position of the Chinese court at Sian-Ku
is growing more and more untenable, ren
dering it probable that the powers will
soon succeed in persuading the Imperial
personages to return to Peking.
Powers . Considering ..Propositions
Made by the United States.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â The lengthy
conference held by Embassadqr Choate
with Ix>rd Lansdowne, British Minister
for Affairs, and â¢ Ambassador
White with Baron von Richthofen, Ger
man Minister for Foreign Affairs, rela'te
to a proposition made by the United
States for the â¢ removal of the two sub
jects of indemnity and commercial
treaties from Peking to Washington or
some other foreign capital for negotia
tion before an international commission.
It appears, however, that the Berlin un
derstanding that Mr. White submitted a
proposal for the withdrawal of troops
from China as soon as the Chinese Gov
ernment accepts all of the articles of the
joint note, except those relating to In
demnity and commercial treaties, Is
rather nn inference- from the proposal and
not a part of the proposal itself. The
United States has from the outset sought
to avoid a prolonged occupancy of China
by the foreign forces.
Jan. 9. â Germany is not yet
willing, to define her position with refer
ence to Secretary Hay's proposal to
transfer the Peking negotiations to Wash
ington, according to a statement made by
a high Forfign Office ofHcial. because an
exchange of views in the Cabinet on the
subject 'is now proceeding. The German
Foreign Office, however, believes Mr.-
Conger's view of the attitude of the Em-
FOR DI&ECT NEGOTIATIONS.
PEKING, Jan. 3;â Li Hung Chang is
better. Both he and Prince Ching balked
at signing the joint note when they con
sidered the question until the court was
heard from again, explaining that the
Emperor's edict directing them to put off
signing prevented them from using the
imperial seal until permission shall have
been received, which permission they
claim to expect hourly. It is known here
among the Chinese that the extreme anti
foreign element is now in power and that
the court favorites now advise the Em
press Dowager. Of these the best known
are Li Chuan Lin, a Cabinet Minister;
General Ma and Tung Fuh Sing. Their
views coincide perfectly with those of the
southern Viceroys, " particularly with
thoife of Chang Chi Tung, who has
threatened to rebel if the note is signed.
Li Hung Chans and Prince Chlng both
strongly urge the signing of the agree
ment, anil they believe tht-ir counsels
must prevail. They have pointed out, in
strongest possible terms, that the. very
existence of China necessitates the ac
ceptance of the terms of the powers, and
that failure on the part of China to sisn
may mean the allies will, as soon as the
state of the weather makes such a step
feasible, send troops over the country,
and that parts of the empire heretofore
untouched will feel the. scourge of war.

MENTO, Jan. 9. âThe San Fran
cisco Senatorial delegation met
and organized to-day by the elec
tion of Wolfe as chairman and
Burnett secretary. There waa no tmmerii
."-te reason for the organization, but it waa
done as a matter of precaution, for
strange tales are bein? bruited about re
garding the possible filching from San
iraacisco cf one of her Senators. Cut
ter's Mil provides that the city shali hava

man nine, but less than ten. an embar
.assinfc- fraction; but still the rumor runs
aiouncl that San Francisco will lose a
Senator.
rhe delegation Rot together to confer
aÂ£oin It. it was aecided to authorize tho
chairman. Senator Wolfe, to wait upon
the Committee on Apportionment and ask
that the matter of the San
Francisco Senatorial districts be left to
the San Francisco Senatorial delegation.
During the afternoon Senator Wolfj
conferred with Assemblyman Flsk. chair
man of thn San Francisco Assembly dele-
Ration, and it is probable that within a
short time the tv.r. allegations will get
together and discuss the retlistrtcting of
San Francisco both as to Assembly and
Senatorial districts.

to the fact that the message had already

some expression that its reading before

courtesy to the Governor, the secretary

MENTO.Jnn. 9. â The Senate com
mittees have been appointed, the

-named and the Senate is really
ready for business. 'The appointment of
the committees caused some surprises and
some disappointments. It was believed
that the Lieutenant Governor would con
sult the Governor on every point and then
It was reported that he would oppose the
Governor, but ,when the list came down
It was seen that imly In one instance did
anything like opposition to the Governor
appear. This was in the appointment of
Belshaw to the chairmanship of the
Prisons Committee.
Belshaw's district Includes San Quen
tln prison, and when Belshaw was mak

ponent was the influence of the prison.
Opposed to him was James II. Wilkins.

YVilklns were the same as those now

wanted the committee and Neff gave it to

The Committee on Reformatories goes
to Smith of Los Angeles, who got it in a
peculiar manner. In some way the Lieu
tenant Governor came to believe that
Smith of Los Angeles was a lawyer of
high ability, so he put the new Senator
on the Judiciary Committee, on that of
Cede Revision and made him chairman cf
that on Constitutional Amendments.
Smith of Los Angeles is a farmerâ a grain
farmer â and he has never boen Inside of
a court or a capitol in his life. Caldwell
of Riverside is a lawyer, and Caldwell
was made chairman of the Committee on
Reformatories. He "kicked" and Smith
"kicked," both from opposite reasons, and
with the consent of an concerned they
traded, and Caldwell was made chairman
of the Committee on Constitutional
Amendments and Smith took Reformato
ries.
And - they went further than this, for
Smith gave up his place on the Judiciary
Committee to Caldwell and took Calrt
well's place on the Committee on Drain
age. . But he would not give up his place
on the Committee on Code Revision.
"There Is a good deal about the codon
that a business man can deal with," said
Smith, and he stayed by the committee.
Smith of Kern, one of the old members
cf the Senate and as able a man as has
been a member of the body, got v.hai
should have been given to him two years
agoâ the Finance Committee. Two years
ago Smith was slated for the committee,
not because he sought It but because by
legislative precedent It belonged to him.
He was sidetracked for Dickinson. Thi3
year he was the only logical candidate
and It went to him. His experience in
legislative affairs and his knowledge of
legislation make the choice a particularly
good one.
The Judiciary goes to Davis of Amador,
an ex-Superior Judge, a lawyer of abliity
and a legislator of intelligence and prin
ciple. It was currenc ;wo days ago that
he would get the appointment.
The Apportionment Committee has been
given to Cutter of. Yuba, secretary of the
Republican State Central Committee, a
holdover Senator and the man who has
been working on the scheme of appor
tionment for some months. There is like
ly to be a light over the apportionment
bill, which Cutterf will introduce, no mat
ter what plan may be proposed, and the
Apportionment Committee wili assume
unusual importance before the close of
the session.
Lukens of Alameda gets the County
Government Committee, ordinarily one
occupied with dry questions of boundary
and surveyors' lines, but this year, in
view of the census and the consequent
changes it will make necessary and jd
viaable, a committee that will have its
hands full. Lukens is a new man in the
Senate, and his appointment is consid
ered a compliment.
Nelson ot San Francisco is given tho
Committee on Enrolled and Engrossed
Bills, one usually glvon to a new Senator.
He was mentioned for the Commerce
Committee, his district, In San Francisco
being one with a great proportion of wa
ter front, but the Commerce Committee
was given to Shortridge and Nelson was
named as next man. He will be the log
ical chairman of that committee at the
next session. â¢
Senator Simpson has hla old committee,
that of corporations. It Is one of the im-^
portant ones of the Senate and belongs
to a legislator of experience and Judg
ment. Simpson waa satisfied with it and
his work as Its chairman at the last ses
sion made the Bleutrnant Governor more
than willing to give it to him. He had
no opposition for the appointment.
"Wolfo was given banking, his old com
mittee, Tyrrell of Nevada mines, as every
one expected. Selvage gets code revision,
Taylor, municipal corporations, and Leav
itt gets printing. Ontal, a new man, gets
revenue and taxation, a committee that
is likely to cut an important figure dur
ing this session. Bettman is given his
old place at the heal of the Committee on
Rules. Lardner, an old legislator but a
new Senator, has the Committee on Edu
cation, which this year will handle all
the bills .that formerly went to the Com
mittee on Education and Public Moral.-..
The name has been shortened, but the
duties have not been curtailed.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO! Jnn. 9.â In order to com
plote its list of attaches and se- j
cure to each member his $8 per
diem patronage the Republicans
were forced in tho session of the As
sembly this afternccn to shut off Dem
ocratic criticism and to turn their hacks
deliberately, upon Governor Gage's recom
mendations in his message of economy.
The previous question, moved by Fisk of
San Francisco, at once gagged the minor
ity and served notice on the Governor
that the raid on the treasury had l*gun
and would not be abandoned simply be
cause the keynote of his message was
economy. . Kelley of Alameda Introduced
the resolution providing for tho appoint
ment cf the number of acditicnul attaches
necessary to cat up what was left of. the
Js per diem patronage per membt-r. ttuiro
of SSan Francisco asked if the olhces
named were statutory or were In addition
to the statutory offices. Kelley eald they
were in addition to the attaches provided
ior by statute, but that. In Â¦ view of the
business to be transacted, it was felt they
were necessary.
"Are they necessary," asked Feliz of
Monterey, "under the volume of present
business, or are you anticipating the busi
ness that will be transacted?"
The present volume of business in the
Assemoly is nil, but no one saw lit to
answer the Monterey member's very per
tinent question.
James of Los Angeles said that there
ought to be some report showing the al
leged necessity of the addition to the stat
utory number of employes.
"1 would respectfully call the attention
of the Republican members," said James,
"to the language of the chief executive in
his message regarding economy. lie
says: '1 most earffestly -appeal to you to
exercise such economy as is compatible
with the necessities of each case by pre
venting the passage of excessive appro
priations and of laws creating unneces
sary offices, with their incidental charges
upon the State.' "
Then Sutro took another twist at the
thumbscrews. He said: "And I would
further call attention to the next recom
mendation in the Governor's message, as
follows: *I would likewise suggest that
the number of employes in your honorable
bodied be reduced to a useful minimum,
so that this Legislature may surpass by
Its economy and efficiency all previous
Legislatures, not only becausÂ«J it is your*
public duty so to do but as well for the
honor which it will bring to you all as leg
islators, and for the credit- It will afford
to the party which has nominated and
elected a majority of your members upon
the pledge of an economic able ad
ministration!' "
All of this hurt. It touched the quick;
but Flsk was ready with a recourse that
displayed the Assembly's disregard of the
Governor's pet ideas and prevented any
further painful thrusts from the opposi
tion. He moved the previous question,
Kelley of Alameda seconded and the meas
ure went through by a party vote. Wright
cf Santa Clara voted with the Democrats.
The report of the Committee on Rules
came up for consideration and was ap
proved. The new rules increase the num
ber of ' members on the Ways and Means
Committee from 11 to 21, and add three
committeesâ one on census and apportion
ment, of eleven members; one on revision
and reform of laws, of eleven members,
and one on immigration, of nine members.
The Governor's message was Jostled
along its stony path by the adoption of a
resolution referring it to a committee of
five, with Instructions to refer various
sections of it to the proper committees.
Alden Anderson, who had been called to"
the chair by Speaker Pendleton, appointed
the following on the committee: Ralston,
Knowland, Carter, Brown of San Mateo
and Cowan. t â¢-Â«. â¢. . :
Dunlap fathered a new scheme which
will change the face of the emerald-hued
landscape of the Assembly chamber in
terior. A resolution offered by him and
adopted provides for placing a second
rail just In the rear of the desks farthest
back. The space between the two â¢ rails
will be known as the "members' lobby,"
and to it will be admitted those only who
are p&ssed Into It by Assemblymen. By
the amendment of rule 70 the wives or
friends of Assemblymen may not be In
vited to scats beside them at their desks,
but it Is understood that in practice this
amendment will not be strlcly /enforced.
"Colonel" Brady of San Francisco to
day offered his first resolution, a purely
routine measure regarding stationery, but
his face beamed while it was being read
and he sat absorbed in the pride of j pa
ternity, forgetting to move the adoption
of the resolution and permitting Bert
Schlcsinger to capture that honor.
Assemblyman Mllice of Riverside has to
look back regretfully upon a lost oppor
tunity. He called up the Senate joint res
olution urging upon Congress the passage
of the "bill now pending which establishes
a national quarantine against fruit - dis
eases and Insect pests. Grove L. Johnson
seconded Mlllee's motion to concur, but
demanded that the orange belt- legislator
explain the necessity of such legislation.
That is where Millce lost his opportunity.
He can prune trees better than he can
shape sentences, and when lie got through
rtio Assembly knew only that In the opin
ion of Milico it was desirable that the
Assembly concur in the joint resolution.
"In view of the very lucid explanation
just made," raid Johnson, "going into all
the whys and wherefores of this matter,
and probing the subject of Insect pests to
ihr very bottom, and also because it will
Eave time. I am in favor of concurrence."
Amid the laughter that followed the mo
tion was passed. â¢ â¢ . â¢ â¢ -
Junketing trips this year, are likely to
he somewhat curtailed. By a resolution
Introduced by Melick of Los Angeles but
three members of any committee will be

it comos to examples of economy in the

it may present a strong linÂ«* of resistance
to a general raid on the taxpayers.
In a recent agitation to raiso money for
higher education the university side of
the Question has been put forward in a
prominent degree, but there is another
side which concerns the taxpayers. The
Legislature may decide to view both sides.
The broad subject of revenue for common
as well a? hither education may fÂ«e per
tinently discussed. For the fifty-first fis
cal year the amount levied for the State
school fund was t2.423.340. The amount
collected was J2.541.43O. From other

glad to see th? fund Increase, but th^re
:p a wide difference of opinion among

permitted to conduct a banking and real

a limit to loan? on real estate and the ex

taxation. It is a matter of common report
That thÂ» regents lost money in loans on
t-'an Jose real estate. It Is a matter of
re-enrd that a large purchase of business
property was made in San Francisco. Jt

thorizing the additional one cent tax. The
scandal would have been the subject of
official investigation by the Legislature If
two or three tft *fac regents had not In

bunkoed. In some degree this is past his

The apprehension expressed In the Gov
ernor's mesage that the exemption of

v.ill materially affect the assessment roil
is not well grounded. The reduction will
be Blight. It is the opinion of the Con
troller that county assessors will hustle
around and make good the decrease by
listing other properties that have hitherto
escaped taxation. In round numbers the
assessment roll Is Jl ,290,000.000. The ex
emption wil hardly be perceptible.
The standing committees of the Senate
were announced this evening. Lleuten-
BBt Governor Keff asslfme-d the Senators
to duty without receiving suggestions
from Governor Gage. There was a con
ference of the Governor and Lieutenant
Governor early this week, but the sub
ject of committee assignment was not in
troduced or mentioned by either. It Is
obvious to the insiders that the Governor
did not recommend Senator Davis as
chairman of the Judiciary Committee
Senator Smith of Kern as chairman of
The Finance Committee or Senator Bel-
Shaw as chairman of the Committee on
Prisons. .* Â¦

PETITION OF HABEAS CORPUS
ON BEHALF OF MRS, NATION
A large block of Union Pacific stock was
bought by Burlington holders In this city
with a view of uniting with the former.
It was reported in Wall Street to-day that
the new Union Pacific alliance would be
still further enlarged by the addition of
other railroads in -the Central West in
cluding,the Chicago and Rock Island.
For several years the Northwestern has
sent most of Its westbound traffic over
the Union Pacific and the latter has re
ciprocated on eastbound . business. â¢
- The Vanderbilts already have represen
tation In the Union Pacific directory, Mar
vin Hughitt, Roswell Miller, Horace G.
Burt, E. II. Harriman and James Still
man being regarded as friendly to Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt. The assumption is
that control will be brought about by the
naming of a majority which Is expected
to take place at an early date. The Union
Pacific stock acquired by the Northwest
ern will be treated In much the same way
as the majority of Jersey Central stock,
which was bought by J. P. Morgan & Co
for the Reading. A collateral trust bond
may be issued, but this is not yet cer
tain* Some favor a lease of the Union
Pacific to the Chicago and Northwestern
This deal was hastened by the discovery
that the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
was anxious to secure the Union Pacific,
or a-t any rate to make a close traffic
deal with, the latter. This compelled the
Northwestern people to hurry their nego
tiations. It is still possible that the In
terests of the Burlington will be consid
ered and the three great systems will be
brought into close harmony, but the con
trol of . the Union Pacific will rest with
the Vanderbilta.
The. original scheme was to lease- the
Union Pacific to the Northwestern, but
it Is not certain whether this will be done
or not. ; The control of the former is to
be aequlretJ through the purchase of a
majority of Union Pacific stock, and this
is being done in the open market, which
accounts for the big jump In price dur
ing the last two days.

"Then does such territory 'all within
the provision which requires dutles'to be
assessed upon foods arriving from a for
â¢elgn eenintry ?" asked Justice Brown. â¢
Â¦Â¦ Before Mr. Richards could, reply -he put
the question In a different shape, say-
Ing:
Â¦ "Does it not cease to be a foreign coun
try?" 'Â¦-Â¦-Â¦ "- ---.:,<Â¦â¢:Â¦ .;:'Â¦-:-Â¦
To this Mr.. Richards answered: "I
think not; not within the meaning of the'
customs law. .The Dingley, bill treated as
foreign all -territory outside of the-limits
of the. United States, leaving the States
and Territories then created for i customs
purposes as the United States and that
condition' remains until' Congress may see
fit to change it." ' -" ; " ;Â¦, - -Â¦ .... '.', , .
Continuin g,- Mr. . Richards . 'Â¦ contended
! that the President has no power -to ex
tend ; the' limits of the United States." but
that the legislalve" branch of , the Govern
ment may.do so upon; whatever terms it
may see fit. He said further that the par
ties to;the treaty both knew that the lo
cation and condition- of itheV Islands ac
quired . by the .war "with Spain Â¦ would - not
permit Â¦ their ; incorporation into the >, Unit
ed States i and the application i to jthem of
those laws which the constitution requires
to be" uniform':^throughout- the United
States.* Â¦â¢' . ; - Â¦â¢ -:'. â¢ . Â¦'â¢ Â¦-. 'â¢Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ .'-â¢ 'â¢Â¦"â¢;Â¦ ':'- cit-sr^
t - Mr.v Richards had Â¦ concluded about I half
of his argument when the court adjourned
i for, tha day. .,' . â¢ > - - ,
I -H. \V. -Ward, counsel for Dooler, Smith
& Co.. laid special stress uron the fact
that the position of ;tha Porto Rlcan law
providing for the collection of duties is
separate from other I carts of that law
and it is limited in ODeration in point of
time to March 1,1902. . . "Â¦
When Mr. Ward.'flnlshed,;SoHcltor Gen
eral Richards began the presentation of
the Government's side of the controversy,
giving especial attention to the effect of
the ratification of the Paris treaty upon
the ; relation of this country and Porto
Rico. He said that denial.: of-' the 'power
which Is being exercised by the President
and Congress. ; amounts ; to sayin<Â» that,
ceded territory becomes by ....e act o'
cession >an â¢ integral part of the' United
States, to which . the , act of- cession. '- to
which the constiution of its own force ap
plies, placing Its: people, its products and
us ports on an Immediate equality with
ours and also extending the constitutional
limitations to such countries. If this was
the case, said Mr, -Richards, the treaty
making power in acquiring territory la
necessarily limited to providing for tbo
mere act of cession.
. "It is thus," he said, "stripped of Its
proper functions: : it cannot treat, it Is
lame, Impotent, Impossible, ridiculous." 1 *
Mr. RlchardB argued that newly ac
quired territory becomes :*not a part bu*
a possession of the. United States terri
tory belonging to the United States," and
he went on to say:
Mr. Coudert was followed^ by Alphonso
C. Hart, who spoke especially of the Arm
strong case,: in which the question in
volved Is the collection of duties on goods
shipped from New i'ork to Porto Rico.
He contended that the constitution of the
United States extends over every porticn
of the national domain, whether State,
Territory or district. Â¦' ' .V
Mr. Coudert contended that in a case of
acquisition the dividing line is passed
when a treaty of acquisition is signed amt
ratified. "When," he said, "wo sanction
acquisition by the ratification of a treaty
we thus signalize our control of and sov
ereignty over such "territory." This, .lie
asserted, had been done In the case of
Porto Rico, in the treaty of 1898, and by
that treaty Porto Rico had become as
much a part of the United States as Cali
fornia had become in the proceedings sub
sequent, to Â« the war with Mexico.
Mr. Coudert expressed the opinion that
such a condition might exist temporarily
and he added that ihe Supreme Court
had recognized it in 'lealing with Tarn
pico in the case of Fleming vs. Page and
In dealing with California in the case of
Cross vs. Harrison before the acquisition
of California by the United States was
contemplated.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â Upon the re
convening of the United States Supreme
Court to-day. F.RCoudert resumed his
argument. In the Pbrib" Rlcan case, con
tinuing hiB contention that Porto Ricq is
not a foreign territory, hence It Is not
competent for Government authorities to
levy and collect duties upon arltcles im
ported from Porto Rico to New York. Be
fore taking up the thread of his argument
Mr. Coudert undertook to respond . to a
question propounded io him yesterday by
Justice Brown whether a country can
cease to be a foreign country and yet not
be a part of the United Statesâ whether
there is an Intermediate condition.

Mondell of Wyoming produced figures
to show that if the money expended upon
the Missouri end Mississippi had been
used to reclaim the arid lands of the West
it would have been * sufficient to build
comprehensive" reservoirs at the : head ot
those streams which would have prevent
ed floods and insured navigation through
out the year. From this he argued that
the Government should immediately en
ter upon the reclamation of arid lands
in the West. - : .
Bell of Colorado argued along the same
lines and gave notice of a"n amendment
he would offer | to appropriate $300,000 for
reservoirs at he headwaters . of the Platte
and Arkansas 1 1 1 i i n i iflW'M'HIfrliWHuiyiilHiliJflii*
Newlands of Nevada spoke In favor of
a provision In the bill for the reservoirs
at the head wa ters of rivers from which
arid ' land Â¦ could be irrigated; He Insisted
that It was the duty of the Government
to promote the use of water for Irrigation
as much as for navigation. The House
then at 5:05 p.' m.~ adjourned. ...
"Because a system of locks and dams
would cost $4,000,000," replied Burton, "We
provide for an expenditure, of about $2,
000,000 at the mouth -of -the Columbia in
this bill. 'If the $4,000,000 were added the
title of this bill would have to be changed
to 'A bill for the development of the Co
lumbia River.' "
Burton took the floor to make his pre
liminary statement in support of the
measure. In reply to a question by Hep
burn, Burton said the sundry civil bill
would carry about JS.OOO.OOO on contracts
previously authorized. The total appro
priations for rivers and harbors ./or the
fiscal year would therefore aggregate
about $48,000,000. He devoted an hour to
giving the committee reasons for abolish
ing the Missouri River Commission. Over
$11,000,000 had been expended on the river,
he said, with rnly trivial development of
navigation. It had less commerce to-day
than It had thirty years ago.
Clark of Missouri asked if the commit
tee would oppose an amendment to allow
the riparian owners along the Missouri
River to build dykes, or wind dams. Bur
ton replied that for himself he would not
oppose such an amendment. He thought
owners could best determine what should
be done. In order that the Missouri
should not be entirely neglected, he added,
the bill carries $300,000 for that portion of.
the river below Sioux City and $50,000 for
that portion above the city.
"Would the gentleman oppose an
amendment to confer upon the Secretary
of War authority to use the appropria
tion to confine the Missouri River with
in its present limits?" asked Hepburn.
"I should hesitate to accept such an
amendment," replied Burton. "I would
regard that as Impracticable owing to the
length of the river. Tho appropriation
would be entirely inadequate to accom
plish any general results." *
Wilson of Idaho asked why, as the com
mittee proposed to repeal the project for
a boat railway from The Dalles Rapids
to CelHo 'Falls, Wash., it had not pro
vided for the alternative proposition of
the engineers for a system of locks and
dams. Â¦':Â¦*Â¦.*.
Burton, chairman of the River and Har
bor Committee, called up the river and
harbor bill. He suggested that general
debate upon the bill be limited to three
hours, but all attempts to secure an
agreement failed.
The joint resolution for the appointment
of ex-Senntor George Gray of Delaware

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â The House con
sidered the river and harbor appropriation
bill to-day. Little progress was made.
In a bill carrvlng such a vast sum for
lecal improvements many localities are
bound to be disappointed and there is
generally considerable, pique among the
members who tail to get what they want.
This feeling outcropped In several places

"\Vhi taker Wright's reception was of a
mixed character. He announced the di
rectors had partially arranged with cred
itors and that the company would be sail
ing smoothly again. It wouid be neces
sary, he added, to adjourn until Monday,
when he believed the shareholders would
hear that all their interests were safe,
and that the scheme for the reconstruc
tion rif the company would be provided
injuring its future prosperity. Mr. Wright
;Â¦".' d that he had advanced a quarter cf a
million pounds to. tide the corporation
over its struggles. Mr. Wright's further
remarks were listened to with considera
ble impatience and tbe meeting closed
â¢with further cheers f c â¢ Lord and Lady
Duiferin.
Protection of Agriculture
A Berlin Eperial says: The Imperial
Chancellor, Count von Bulow, in the low- ;
er House of the Diet to-day strong-Iy i
supported the claims for the protection ;
of agriculture. He said:
"1 consider It the foremost duty cf the i
Government to effect a reconciliation in ;
the existing economic difficulties and the '
adjustment of the varying interests sup
porting thope who are unable to herp
themselves through their own strength.
I snail abide by the opinion that when
one member of a special body suffers and
the members suffer, especially that as
long as such an important vocation as
agriculture is ur.heaithful, the entire or
ganization must be undermined. I am
convinced that It is the duty of the Gov
ernment to afford trade, industry- and ag
riculture an equal measure of protection, i
but that one of them, agriculture, abso- 1
lutely needs strong protection. It is in !
pursuance of this principle of even-handed ;
justice that the bill for the completion :
Â£nd improvement of the canal has been )
drawn up. If The measure favored Indus- j
try at the expense of agriculture or the :
West monarchy to the detriment of the !
East, I would not have supported it."
Irford Dufferin added that he felt when
two such eminent men were connected
with the concern he could legitimately
join. He soon discovered he had bitier
opposition from persons trho desired his
resignation. Hoping that a depreciation
of the securities would not follow, he
Ftuck to his position and investments, and
thougrh a greater sufferer than most of
the shareholders, he bad no regret if he
had helped to convince them of his good
faith. Later he four.d the duties to be a
physical strain beyond his advancing
ve.ars and he wanted to withdraw, but
was haunted by the fear of a detrimental
effect and held on to the chairmanship
until he received news of the serious con
dition of h:s young son. when he yielded
to the motber'a prayer to take her at
once to t^J-uth Africa, He sent In his
resignation with a clear conscience, be
lieving that the surrender of his position
u::dÂ«r ?uch circumstances was natural
and that none would dream of placing a
sinister interpretation on It. He had no
anticipation then that the London ard
Globe would default from its engage
ment on the Stock Exchange. The- news
reached him in Ireland, and in the pres
er.ee of such a calamity be felt that any
private consideration must be sunk.
In conclusion Lord Dufferin. wtft was
deeply moved, declared that the patience
end generosity with which those present
had heard him would be one of the bright
est souvenirs of his old age. He took his
seat amid loud cheers.
LONDON. Jan. 9.â Amid cries of "turn ;
him out," hootirg and other hostile Inter
ruptions, the Marquis of Dufferln and
Ava, chairman of the suspended London
and Globe Finance Corporation, Limited,
at the extraordinary meeting of the corn- |
pany called for to-day succeeded in at
least temporarily appeasing tho wrath of
the shareholders. The hall was packed
ar.d the disorders were evidently support
ed bv a considerable faction, as warm
cheering was mingled with the hisses and
hoots.
As a result of the explanations of the
directors the shareholders voted an ad
journment until Monday, when a scheme
for the reconstruction of the concern
wi!l be submitted.
Ix>r>3 Dufferin spoke with evident emo
tion as he explained his personal relations
with the corporation, and the result of the
meeting was largely a tribute to him- 1
self. During the course of his remarks ,
he explained that he was induced to ac- j
cept tb? chairmanship at the solicitation \
of the late Lord Loch and Sir William i

HOOTING GREETS
LORD DUFPERIN
The Fire I>epartrnent responded quickly.
Thf Brooklyn fireboats. the David Boody
and the Seth Low. went 'to the fire and
found DO room to work, when the steam
ship Coya. which recently arrived -from
Callao. was cut adrift from the .burning
pier shed and moved outside into the ba
sin. There her crew, having set the
pumps working, fought the flames with
the deck hose and before long: had the
fire under control.
On the other side of the p!er was lying
the tramp steamer St. Dunstan, from Liv
erpool, with a cargo of fruit and sugar.
Her crew hurr'.ecl on dec-K when the Idle
wild banned alongside, rushed over the
side and managed to get ashore, while
the fireboats took care of the abandoned
ship, quenched the llamee after her deck
house had caught fire and her port side
had been badly bllsterec, and then set her
adrift.
Th* Idlewild meanwhile had burned to
the water's edge and a couple of lighters
also had been destroyed. Fire tugs and
engine companies were pouring their
streams into the. burning stores, but the
water v,as swallowed up in steam, and
the best that could be done was to keep
the edge of the burning pier drenched and
prevent the fire from spreading.
By 4 o'clock the llam<?6 had died down
to a smoulder in the bales and debris that
had settled-upon the piling.
Alvord Pleads Guilty.
Cornelius L. Alvord Jr., the former note
teller of the First National Bank, was
arraigned before Judge Thomas In the
X.'nited States Court, criminal branch, to
day and pleaded guilty to three counts
of an indictment charging him with em
bezzling $7C0,000 from the bank named.
The Indictment contained fifty-seven
counts. Alvord will be sentenced Tues
day, January 15.

"Cruiser Nor Yacht.
LONDON. Jan. 9.â The unfortunate new
royal yacht Victoria and Albert, which
has been a source of. trouble to her de
signers and builders from the very start,
is now. It Is stated, practically con
demned. It Is understood that three
quarters of & million pounds sterling
($3,730,000) has already been expended on
the construction of the vessel.
G. L. Watson of Glasgow, who was
commissioned by the Admiralty to in
spect the yacht, spent some time on her
recently with Admiral Fullerton and other
officials. - It Is pointed out that the Vic
toria and Albert was designed by men
accustomed to building warships. Con
sequently they made her the strangÂ«
blend of a pleasure vessel and a cruiser.
In fact when the Prince of "Wales saw the
vessel he said her designers had attempt
ed a yacht and produced a cruiserâ a very
poor one, too.

CHICAGO, Jan. 9.â Private funeral serv
tces over the body of the late Philip D.
Armour were held at 11 o'clock to-day at
the Armour residence, 2115 Prairie avenue.
Following the services at the house the
body was taken to the Armour Institute,
where from noon until 3 o'clock it lay in
state and was viewed by thousands of
people, including- throngs of employes
from the ?reat packing bouses and other
business interests of the dead millionaire.
Many of the men stood for hours in tha
street for an opportunity to get a last
glimpse of their former friend and em
ployer.
The services at the house were of the
simplest character, carrying oat the ex
press wishes of the deceased, and were
attended only by the family and close
friends. Singing was furnished by the
choir of the Second Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Armour's two favorite hymns, "Jesus.
Lover of My Soul," and "Now I Lay Me
Down to Sleep." were, sung followed oy
a solo, "Be Still.? E>r. Gunsaulus of
Plymouth Congregational Church, where
Sir. Armour formerly attended services,
then offered a prayer and read the twen
ty-third Psalm and the fourteenth chap-'
ter of St. John.
The home was flll-d with flowers. They
came from everywhere, many beautiful
pieces being sent on cable orders from far
off countries and from employes In nearly
every Large city of the country.
At 2 o'clock public funeraJ services were
held In Armour Institute, and here again
simplicity -was observed in every arrange
ment. Dr. Gunsanlus delivered no funeral
sermon, simply reading from the fifteenth
chapter of First Corinthians. Singing by
the choir followed and the vast crowd
then united In the- Lord's Prajrer. After
the conclusion of the service* the coffin
was taken to a special funeral train and
conveyed to GraceJand Cemetery, where
the body was laid to rest in the Armour
lot.
The Commercial Crab and the St. An
drew Society, of which Mr. Armour was
a member, attended the services in a body.
Representatives of the firm from Omaha.
Kansas City, New Tork and many other
cities were also present.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9.â The United
States Grand Jury made Us final report
yesterday and has been discharged.
In a!! six indictrmnts were found, five
of which have not yet been made public
owing: to the fact that the persons in
dicted have not been arrested.
Two queries propounded by the jury to
Judge Wellborn and the answers of the
court are of interest to every attorney in
the State and to all persons interested in
the oil Industry. Â»
September U last Judge Ross in his de
cision of the case of the Cosmos Ex
ploration Company against' the Gray
Eagle Oil Company called the attention of
the United States District Attorney to
some of the affidavits filed in the suit in
the following languace:
"In conclusion I think it proper to say
that from the nature of the affidavit's
tiled in these- cases it is manifest that
tome of the affiants have committed will
ful and deliberate perjury. The attention
cf the United Sta.cs Attorney for this
district is therefor* directed to the mat
ter, that he may brirsit affidavits to
the attention of the Grand Jury now im
paneled for this district, that they may
carefully look into ifcera and take such
action as may bt> found necessary." â¢
The queries propounded bv the Grand
Jury were in regard to the jurisdiction or
that body with reference these affi
davits, and Judge Wellborn: after citing
authorities, drams the following conclu
sion:
"From the definition of perjury, as
quoted and explained from and by the
foregoing statute ar.d authorities. " it k*
clear and beyond doubt that to constitute
false swearing in an affidavit and made In
the course cf a judicial proceeding the
court must have jurisdiction of Â«uch pro
ceed ings.
"Appqrtas this rule of law to the postu
lates assumed in your question -my. con
clusJen is that since the affidavits to
which you refer w^re used ar.d designed
for use In a suit of which the court Â«tu
Â¦without jurisdiction the persons making:
the affidavits, hpwever great their moral
delinquency, are no; amenable to an ia
dictmeat for p*rjury.*"

TTTMA. Arts.. Jan. P.â Thomas Hart,
who shot and killed Under Sheriff M. B.
Pevane last nlpht. while the latter was
attempting: to arrest him and his two
partners for the theft of a case of whisky,
was captured early this morning in the
railroad yards and placed in jail with
more than a score of other strangers
picked up in different parts ot the
town ar.d surrounding country. His guUt
xvas r.ot learned until after 10 o'clock this
tnorninjt. when John Cody and James
Ray, who had been identified by different
witness** as being two of the men who
were wanted, turned State's evidence and
branded Hart as the murderer.
Cody anJ Ray. who are tramps, claim to
have known Hart, who is a srajirt, well
dressed fellow, but two days. It is be
lieved he is a desperate crock wanted
somewhere for a serious offense, and this
fact led him to murder the officer who
attecapted to arrest him.
Â¦ An excited thrortir of citisens crowded
about the Courthouse and jail all fore
noon, and threats of lynching were made-
It is probable these would have been car
ried out. but the murderer was removed
from the Cour.ty Jail to the Territorial
rcr.itrntia.ry while nearly the entire pop

SEATTLE, Jan. 3.â The steamship Dlrl
go arrived this afternoon and brought
startling news from Sltka. The Indians
.at that place, who were recently padded,
became troublesome again and on the Slst
of December shot Captain Baranoff, an
old pioneer of Sitka. while he wa3 in his
boat in the bay b^low the town. -
According to the story which is told by
Purser Baker and one of the engineers
cf the Dlrisro. who were the only officers
to go ashore during the steamship's stay
at that port, the body of Captain Baranoft
was found In his boat with his gun beside
it on the afternoon of the Slst of Decem
ber. At first it was thought lhat some
accident had discharged the srun, but
afterward a small boy who was on the
shi->re near by when the tragedy occurred
said that he saw iwt Siwashes steal up
the beach and shoot through the bodv of
the row boat, killinir.the old man.
The troubles of thf- Sltka Indians had
for some time been causing uneasiness on
the part of the whites, for the natives
were in a big majority and it was only
the presence of the military that kept
them in order. These troubles arose over
totems and s<?t all the clans against one
another. They were cxrried into court
and during the rakl-ile of December were
settled by arbitration. t

Fair Strike Made in Well of Victoria
Company
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 9.â There Is consider
able excitement on the streets this even
ing on account of a report which has
been authenticated of a strike- In the oil
well of the Victoria Company about four
and a half miles north of Encinitas. The
well is within forty miles of San Diego
and therefore about fifty miles south of
any previous find of oil in the State. The
strike is by no means a gusher, and un
less a greater amount of oil is found
it Is doubtful if the stock would pay
anv large dividends trom the yield of
the well. The superintendent of the well
and President Woodward of the company,
as well as others who are competent to
Judge of oil and oil finds, assert that if
the well were cleaned out and worked at
its present depth it would be a producing
well to the extent of ten barrels of oil
per day. The owners of the . company
have no intention of stopping where they
are at the depth of only 630 feet, but will
put the drill down through the present
stratum of oil and Into the third stratum.
which is usually the one carnrinsr the
largest quantity of oil in Southern Cali

Knodell, representing the Anti-Saloon
League, has been before the Board of Su

petitioned the board to set & flay for the
hearing of the same. The day set by the
Supervisors was February 6 at 10 a. m.
The Supervisors ordered that the Dis
trict Attorney be directed to prepare and
submit an ordinance upon similar lines

points outside of the lncorportated cities
of Santa Cruz and Watsonville. It is said
that the towns of Boulder Creek. Ben
Lomond and Soquel are to incorporate, so
that any liquor ordinance that may be
passed will not apply to them.-.

Woman Charged With Arson
Accuses Relatives of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Santa Clara County Officers Obtain
Letters Containing Her Signa- :-
, SAN JOSE, Jan. 9.â Sensational devel
opments are looked for next Monday when
the examinations of Mrs. Sallie Ruff,
charged with arson anil murder, and of
Conrad. Carl. Ludwig and Jonas Ruff and
William Valdez for arson come up before
Justice Rosenthal. All are out on bail ex
cept % r aldez. who was the hired man at
the Ruff dairy.
Mrs. Ruff and her attorneys claim that
there have been* a number of letters
forged, purporting to be written by her.
This Is a pha&e of the case which the
Sheriff's office cannot understand..
Since, the wholesale arrest for arson,
growing out of the burning to death of
the four Run* children, many letters have
come Into the hands of the officials. One
of these Mrs. Ruff pronounces a rank
forpery. It-ia a letter purporting to be
signed by Â¦ herself and husband and ad
dressed to Ludwtg 1 Ruff at Marysville. in
which a proposition to turn the dairy over
to him is made.
Carl Ruff claimed -Mrs. Ruff wrote this
letter, and to prove it was her writing
produced a letter from Germany, which
he claims Mrs. Ruff had forwarded. Mrs.
Ruff says she never received or saw this
letter until it was in the hands of the
Sheriff. It is from G. Giller at Tauflcirc
ken. a. sister of Mrs. Ruff. The writer
says she has not heard from Mrs. Ruff
for some time, and some weeks previously
she had received a letter stating- Mrs.
Huff was dead. Furthermore the letter
says Mrs. Ruff had "5,000 marks on de
posit In an Australian bank. Carl Ruff,
the brother-in-law, declares this letter
was written' by Mrs. Ruff to deceive her
husband In regard to her wealth.
Mrs. Ruff Intimates that her husband
and his relatives have been conspiring
to g-et her money, and w-rote that she was j
dead in the hope that the money -would
be forwarded here for her child, and they
would then obtain possession of it.
But little evidence rel&tins to the origin
of the fire has been unearthed.

of June 14, was continued before a Jury
in Judge Cook's court yesterday. Clinton
closed his evidence as a witness for the

to this city.
Dr. H. E. Morrison testified that when
he saw the defendant shortly after the

same effect. t

two weeks there and when he left for
Minneapolis she gave him $40. Altogether
she had given him between $700 and $S0O,
she said, besides numerous presents, in
cluding a silver matchbox, silver shaving
set, embroidered suspenders with her pro
tograph on them, silk ties, gloves, table
cover crocheted by herself for ills mother
and other articles. He used to send her
two or three letters a day sometimes, and
regularly corresponded with her till she
came here on June 10, four days before
the shooting. He led her to understand
that he was divorced from his wife, and
that she was the only woman he loved.

ing assembled. "Mr. Chairman" or "'Mr.
President" is clearly out of all question
and improper. "Mrs. Chairman" doesn't
sound exactly nice; neither does "Mrs
Chairwoman. "Mrs. President" or "Mrs.
Presidentess" are not to be toleratedâ at
least Assistant Secretary Hooe objects to
the use of either of the terms and there
the matter stands.
"Have you any new plans to propose
in the management of school affairs?"
was asked.
"I have not," was the reply. "I intend
feeling my way slowly and cantlously.
but still I will introduce a new system oi*
bookkeeping in the office. The system
now in use is too antiquated. We need 3
new and more modern one. The books are
now kept the same as they were years
and years ago when the department wa a .
small and there was not so great a need
for an extended and up-to-date business
system. There are several branches of
the department, such as the repair shop
and the supply department, that are in
need of a new system of bookkeeping.
The new system I will introduce in time,
but as I said before I am going to pro
ceed very cautiously. I will devote all
my time and energies to the advancement
of the interests of the department and I
hope to soon show. that the business af
fairs of this branch of the municipal gov
ernment cap he safely entrusted to a w o- r
man's hands." " Â¦ * Â¦" ' Â¦
my associates I do not expect any trouble.
Of course. I fully appreciate the honor
conferred on me. It may seem strange at
first to see a lady- presiding over the de
liberations of a body of gentlemen, but in
time the newness will wear off. I feel
that there will not , be any call for strict
parliamentary- rulings and that the busi
ness of the board will be conducted as
harmoniously as in the past."
Will of Captain Andrew Nelson Bars
Amy One Engaged in Traffic
From His Estate. *
The will of Captain Andrew Nelson, who
died January 1. was filed for probate yes
terday. Decedent beaueaths a life inter
est in his entire estate, the value of which
is not given, to his wife, and provides that
upon her death the estate shall be distri
buted to his brother, Johan Nelson, of
Boda, Sweden, and his nephews and
nieces. Decedent provides, however, that
none of those mentioned shall share in hl3
estate If they are engaged in tho liquor
business.
"This proposition is msertedby me," the
testator says, "on account of my an
tipathy to the liquor traffic, as I have
seen its effect In accomplishing the ruin
of many of my friends and acquaintances.
And I do not desire any of my hard
earned money to assist a business that I
consider baneful."
CARRIES ANTIPATHY TO
LIQUOR TO THE GRAVE
MMS. MART \V. KINCAID enjoys
the distinction of being the first
of her sex to preside over any
branch of the local government.
She was elected president of the
Board of Education yesterday in accord
ance with an agreement made one year
ago when the members of the board were
appointed by Mayor Phelan. Cecil "W.
Mark, Mrs. Kincaid, John B. Casserly and
James Denman, who were appointed to
rule over the destinies of the School De
partment, agreed when they were first ap
pointed that they should draw lots to as
certain who was to ro out 'at the expira
tion of the first year. ' It was further
agreed that thÂ« director who drew tho
ehort straw and with it the short term
should be presiding officer. The short
Btraw was drawn by Mrs. Kincaid and
Director Mark drew the two-year term.
Mark is not a prophet, but he can look
quite a distance ahead. He proposed to
Mrs. Kincaid that they swap straws. She
agreed and accordingly was accredited
with the two-year term, while Mark ac
cepted the one-year term and the presi
dency of the board. There are some who
are now uncharitable enough, to say that
Mark was not solely actuated by gallant
ry when he proposed giving up the two
year term to Mrs. Kincaid. They claim
that ho fljjured out that when the short
term expired Mayor Phelan would still
be in office and that he would stand a
good chance of being reappointed, whil.?
if he took the two-year term., there was
a likelihood that the Mayor's office w r ouid
be filled by some one other than his friend
Phelan when the term expired. Be that
as it may, Mark was reappoirited Tues
day to serve four years longer as a plain,
common, ordinary director, and according
to the original agreement Mrs. Kincaid,
who has Gut one year longer to serve,
was entitled to the office of president of
the educational board. She -was the unan
imous choice of her 1 associates for
the presidency yesterday and the honor of
being the first lady chosen president of
the Board of Education was given her as
per agreement. Mrs. Kincaid, after being
elected, gracefully acknowledged the hon
or conferred upon her. "I hope," said she,
"to bring to my own aid the best charac
teristics of a presiding officer. I fully ap
preciate the responsibilities Involved and
the large field of duties to be covered. I
wjjl discharge the duties attendant upon
the office Justly and I will largely depend
on the harmonious co-operation of the
gentlemen associated with me on the
Board of Education. I also bespeak the
public-spirited co-operation of the Super
intendent of Schools."
A love feast followed. Resolutions ex Â¦
pressing the appreciation of the services
of the retiring president were adopted and
Director Mark in return for the same told
of how agreeable had been his term as
presiding officer. "In fact," saiu he, "I
have never before been associated with
persons with whom communion has been
pleas anter."
Directors Denman and Casserly and the
newly elected president bowed modestly
in recognition of the verbal bouquet tossed,
them. Congratulations and hand-shaking
were in order and the next iÂ».n minutes
were spent by the directors in telling one
another how much they regarded each
other.
"There will not be any change in the
policy of the department," said Mrs." Kin
caid yesterday afternoon. "I have no
revolutionary measures or ideaj to intro
duce. Everything will go on just as be
fore and with the hearty co-operation of
In Judge Fritz's court Thomas Corbett
pleaded guilty and was fined $10, and the
case of John Phillips, clerk for Zick
Abrams, was continued for one week, to
be set, as he demanded a trial by Jury.
In Judge Cabaniss' court H. Muller and
Joseph Mohan pleaded guilty and were
each fined $10. A second case against Jo
seph Mohan and the cases of Thomas Cor
bett and George Duncan were dismissed,
as they were duplicated Jn other courts.
The cases of Zick Abrams and Abe Kraus,
his clerk, in this court were continued for
a month.
In Judge Conlan's court D. J. Crowley,
John Gauagher, James King, James Smith
and Harry K. Corbett pleaded guilty and
were each fined $10. The cases of George
Duncan, D. J. Crowley (.second charge),
Henry Schwartz and Harry E.' Corbett
(second charge) were dismissed, as Attor
ney Coffey said they were duplicated In
other courts. The case of ZicK Abrams,
who demanded a jury trial, was continued
till a week from Saturday, to be set.
Thomas Corbett, Joseph Mohan and J.
Smith tnen pieaded guiuy ana were each
tinea $10. in the second case against
Thomas Corbttt, and in the cases of Jo
seph Jtsrown and H. W. Pike. Attorney
Coftey tsaid that the evidence against
them was insunicient and he askea mat
they be dismissed, whicn was aone. In
the cases of liarry K. Corcett, William
Daly and Walter Alclnerney, known as
the "fcan Jose commission cases," Attor
ney Collins asked lor a continuance Ull
this morning, as Daly could not be pres
ent till then, and he would promise that
all the defendants would be in court. Cof
fey declined to rely upon Collins' promise
and insisted on the cases being proceeded
with, as the remittiturs had been sent
down ten days ago, but the Judge contin
ued them till this morning.
Attorney Coftey said there was of course
no legal obligation on the part of the de
fendants to carry out their part of the
stipulation, but jiioraliy they were bound
to do so. He insisted that Attorney Col
lins was lacking in professional etiquette
in stating that he was not aware of the
terms of the stipulation, and ther.e was a
warm exchange of opinions personally be
tween the two attorneys. Collins inti
mattd that whatever, action the defend
ants might taue was without his approval
and it would oe understood that lie with
drew from tho cases.
.All the poolsellers, with the exception of
Zick .Abrams, have carried out their part
of the stipulation made with Chief Sulli
van, notwithstanding' the opposition of
their attorney, George D. Collins, and the
Police Court calendars have been cleared
of the casesâ twenty-one in number.
Each Fined $10 and Ssveral Cases
Are Dismissed, as They Are
Duplicated in Other
Courts.
They All Plead Guilty With
the Exception of Zick
Abrams.
POOLMEH STAY
BY STIPULATION
Some weeks agro the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals reversed the deci
sion of the Interstate Commerce Commi.Â«-
Fioners in the case of the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company. The Commissioners
had made praded rates from Pueblo to
the Pacific Coast, and one result was the
enforced closing down of large works in
this city, which were unable to meet the
competition made possible by the decision
in the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
matter. Since the reversal by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, the rail
ways, which obeyed the order of the com
mission under protest, have waited lor
the decision in the Kindel case.- Now this
decision is against graded rates and in
favor of the postage stamp proposition.
Denver is now able to compete with
Chicago and St. Louis on the Pacilic
Coast in poods made in the Denver terri
tory, for Denver has been given the same
privileges as the others. On the other
rand. Denver has not gained what it
sought, which was the graded rate propo
sition. Thia is the substance of Mr.
"Wheeler's view of the matter. San Fran
cisco has more choice of markets in which
to purchase. The postage stamp rate
Â¦works against advantages of geographi
cal position and gives an advantage to the
locality best able to produce a certain ar
ticle.
The Pacific i.'oapt has gained its conten
tion before the Interstate Commerce Com
miBFioii runcerning graded rates by the
decision just rendered by the commission
in Lhe Denver ease of Georgv J. Kinde!.
That is the view \Y. R. Wheeler takes
cf the matter and his opinion is echoed
by the commercial community of San
Francisco. The St. Louis jobbers soupht
to carry two points in the suit in which
the Pacific Coast was directly concerneJ.
They v.anted to have rates graded on a
distance basis to give them the Pacific
Ccast trade as against the rates Kiven to
the Atlantic coast by reason of sea con.
petition; also to destroy tfie Pacific Coast
differentials. The decision in the Denver
case just rendered, so far from making
graded rates for Denver, extends the
poetage stamp rate west of the Missouri
River. As to the differentials, the mer
chants of thia city are eatisfied that the
railway will always be compelled to meet
the sea competition.
One Leading Point In Contention
With St. Louis Jobbers
Would Seem to Be
Settled.

"Central House." 653 Lake street. Appleton, "Wis., was cured of an annoying case
of catarrh of the kidneys by Peruna. In a recent letter to Dr. Hartman she says:
"/ recently caught cold which settled in the kidneys and caused mo
serious inconvenience. Nothing I did seemed io help me and iha doctor
advised a change of climate. As that was out of the question fcr me, I
tried Peruna as a last resort and I found it was a godsend io me. In two
days I began to feel better, and in less than two weeks the kidney trouble
was greatly relieved. I used four bottles and am entirely cured, and if I
ever fee/ t any lassitude I take Peruna and always with tho same good
result." â Mary Lawler.

/^ OVERNOR JORDAN of New Hampshire in
( """T his recent inaugural address told the Legisla-
tare the paramount issue in that State is the
preservation of forests. He is reported as having de
nounced the wasteful methods of lumbermen, and to
have said: "The lumber interests are great, and the
greater they are under the present methods the worse
it is for the State." He declared that since the lum
bermen will not confine their cutting to trees of a
proper size, nor make any effort to prevent waste, the
State should step in and compel them to do so, and
to that end he proposed to the Legislature that New
Hampshire, "by the exercise of its power of eminent
domain, take once more the ownership of its most
desirable forest lands."
We are too far distant from the scene of action to
determine whether the drastic measure advocated by
Governor Jordan be expedient or not. 'It can be as
serted, however, that if. the waste of lumber can be
checked in no other way, then the policy of the Gov
ernor is not only advisable but is, in fact, imperative.
A rich young country like the United States can stand
a good deal in the way of foolish legislation and bad
economics, but there is no part of it can stand a de
struction of the forests. That is something tha:
spells destruction for the State itself.
It appears from our Eastern exchanges that the
address of the Governor is in no way an exaggeration
of the e\-ils that have befallen New Hampshire
through the waste of its timber. In various directions
the State has been injured. In some streams, for
example, where there was abundant water power at
all seasons of the year, there are now torrents in
spring and dry beds in summer.^ In other places that
were once the resort of tourists and summer visitors
the mountain sides have been made so bleak and bar
ren by the destruction of trees that people no longer
visit them.
" It is^not in New Hampshire only that forest wasting
has been carried too far. From every portion of the
Eastern States the same complaint comes. The evil,
ir fact, is national A recent report states that Chief
Geographer Gannett of the United States Geological
Survey estimates the total stand" of timber through
out the United States at 1.380,000,000,000 feet. Stat
istics collected in 1890 show that the cut for that year
was about 25.000,000,000 feet. Later data has not been
obtained, but of course th*e cut has increased with the
years. Moreover, the figures given for the cut do
not include what was wasted. Consequently a;nuni-
A LESSON FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.
There is one feature of the moving sidewalk which
renders it less advantageous than car linesâ the tun
rel in which it is operated must be constructed in i
circle, as the revolving way must constitute an end
less chain. The route to be established in Paris is
planned on that principle and will form a circle
ai ound the grand boulevards. It will contain three
moving ways: The first will revolve *at the rate of
a little over three miles an hour; the second six and
three-quarter miles an hour; the third, adjoining the
balustrade, will move at the respectable speed of
eleven and a quarter miles an hour. Parallel to the
slowest moving way will be a stationary pavement.
Ai at the exposition, posts with knobs will be placed
at intervals of fifteen feet along each of the ways to as
sist passengers in mounting and in passing from one
revolving platform to the other.' Frequent entrances
by shafts will be provided along the route, probably
every ioo or 200 yards.
If the enterprise be successful Paris will have
another attraction for 'the world. Electric cars can
be seen anywhere, but for some years to come it will
be in that city only that the latest thing in city transit
can be found in practical operation.
The dispatches are authority* for the statement that
England wants to buy a Spanish island. It is to be
hoped that the governmental purchasers will not for
get that we" are the possessors of. many islands which
have, not been ours' long enough for them to have
lost their Spanish characteristics.
It will be 'remembered the moving sidewalk was
first tried on a large scale at the Chicago exposition.
It is therefore an American invention, but for ono
reason or another our people were not sufficiently
attracted by it to develop it, and consequently since
the Chicago experiment no other has been attempted
in this country in a measure of any magnitude. The
invention has been much more successful in Paris.
It appears that of all the novelties at the recent expo
sition in that capital none was more delightful to the
Parisians than what they call the "tfottoir roulant."
It was the pet plaything of the populace for seven
months, and now that the 'exposition is over a com
pany, backed by large capital, has been formed to
construct and operate such sidewalks under ground.
WHILE London and New York have provided
for rapid transit from one parti of the city to
another by means of underground railways,
Paris is considering a scheme of constructing beneath
the streets a moving sidewalk, or rather a series cf
sidewalks, giving ttie passenger choice of three de
grees of speed. :- w> v
RAPID TRANSIT IN PARIS. *
An event of exceptional interest in the
art world is the recent appearance of
Elizabeth Ruth Carey's "Rossetti Book."
published by G. P. Putnam's Sons. It is
a handsome volume, printed in** larjj?,
clear type. and written from ample knowl
edge of the fascinating subject, in a lu
cid,. leisurely, elegant style and illustrated
in choicest fashion with some twenty
seven photogravures.' Miss Carey has
chosen to write chiefly of Dante Gabrirl
and* Christina Rossetti, most talented
members of the distinguished family, but
a sufficient sketch of the elder Rossettis.
exiled from Italy on account of political
opinions, is Included.
A curious household Is this of which
Miss Carey permits us so intimate yet
discreet a glimpse. Rossetti. pere, him
self a pqet, singer and artist of some
Email distinction, earning a slender pit
tance in London by teaching Italian and
gathering: about him for the indirect edu
cation of his talented tribe painters, mu
sicians, writers, scholars, politicians, ven
ders, teachers. Italians almost without
exception. Mazzini and some of the Bona
parte family were among this political
crowd, by the way.
A lovable figure Miss Carey paints of
Mrs. Rossetti, mere. "She was religious
in temperament, extremely domestic,
fond of books, simple and dignified in
manner, warm in feeling, steady in a.c
tion, a fortress of defense for her husband
am. children against the difficulties that
assailed them." Of her own conception
of the life of the mother and wife of
genius, a quaint light may be gained from
her ,naive remark, quoted with consid
erable relish by her son William: "I al
ways had a passion for intellect," she
said, "and my wish was that my hus
band should be distinguished for intellect
and my children, too. I have had my
wish, and I now wish that there were a
little less Intellect in the family, so as to
allow for a little mor^ common sense."
Quaint, elfin, precocious children the
Rossettis must have been; "passionate
after dreams and unconcerned about re
alities, their favorite pursuits rhyming,
painting, reading, acting," in place of ac
tive sports and lively games. Small won
der that the first of a household and
childhood'so unusual should be remarka
ble among the sons of men. This history
of Dante Gabriel Rossetti is interesting
as much to the student of genius as to
the artist. Consciously and joyfully ec
centric, consciously a genius, quixotically
generous, brilliantly imaginative, minute
ly conscientious in his art. eminently sin
cere, given to lavish enthusiasm and ab
solutely without artistic jealousies, by
turns lazy and immensely industrious,
willful, lovable, wayward and "difficult,"
Rossetti is a typical genius, devoured by
the sifter flames of poetry and painting, i
His history. involves the larger share of
the' brilliant little story of the pre-Ra
phaelite brotherhood. Mlllais, Hunt,
Woolner. Collinson. Stephens and Dante
and William Rossetti were among the
"charter" members of the distinguishÂ»;d
little company, and the tale of its trials
anu final acceptance as a "school" is most
interestingly told by Miss Carey.
The book is replete with interesting, and
characteristic anecdotes. Rossettl was a
passionate lover of animals, including ihe
most various and unusual specimens of
the tribe, and on one occasion the artist
was making serious overtures for the
purchase of "an attractive young ele
phant." In all good faith, Rossetti de
fended the wisdom of his intended pur
chase to his friends, "I mean to teach
him to clean the windows," he said; "then
when some one passes the house he will
see the elephant cleaning the windows
and will say. 'Who lives in that house?"
and people will tell him. 'Oh. that's a
painter called Rossetti,' and he will say
â¢I think I should like to buy one of that
man's pictures.' So he will ring to come
In and I shall sell him a picture."
Rossetti the poet is handled in the
same sufficient and gracious fashion a*
Rossetti the painter, and the life and
work of Christina is a kindly and delicate
appreciation of tfiis curiously limited but
undoubted genius. The, illustrations arc
a marked feature of. tho book's attrac
tions, and it ; Is interesting to note in t hi*
connection that'a considerable number of
the. most important of -the: pictures (in
cluding the famous "I^ody Ulith") adorn
an American gallery; that of the Wilming
ton connoisseur.- Samuel' Bancroft 'Jr.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
f | POX the assembling of the Senate after New
Year Senator Ledge opened the business of the
new century by introducing a resolution declar
iv.p: ""That in the opinion ot this body the time has
come when the principle, twice amrmed in interna
tional treaties tor Cct.tral Africa, that native races
should be protected .against the destructive traffic in
intoxicants, should be extended to all uncivilized peo
l>}es by the enactment of such laws and the making
of such treaties as will effectually prohibit the sale bv
the signatory po\yers to aboriginal tnbes and unciv
liued races of opium end intoxicating beverages.
We learn frcm the reports that when the resolution
was read Senator Se-.vell of New Jersey asked for an
explanation, saying h; would like to have a little light
or the subject; but when he was informed that any"
discussion would result in having the resolution "sent
to the calendar" to be taken up at a future time, he
withdrew his request, and the resolution was adopted
as- it stands.
It is to be regretted that the New Jersey man was
eo compliant to Senatorial courtesv. The countrv
would like to have some explanation of the reason
why the international concert is to undertake the bur
den of guarding the yellow man, the black man, the
red man and the b~own man from the intoxicants
which are chiefly made and mainly used by the white
rran :.:"Â¦--..:. rtirtnermore, it would be pleasing to
h2ve some idea of the class and number of people
v.ho are to be included among the '"aboriginal and
uncivilized races" withiu the meaning of the resolu
tion.
It is good to preach temperance, it is better to
practice ternperar.ee, and it may be best of all to
compel uncivilized folks to practice it; but it will b;
a hazardous experiment to have an international con
cert engage in the work. Are we to say to British,
German and French that they shall not sell brandy or
schnapps to the races of Africa; to the Russians that
they shall not diffuse their mighty liquors among
the tribes of Asia; and shall those nations hold our
h^nd in circulating whisky in the Philippines?
The resolution, we repeat, sounds weli, but needs
explanation. There is danger the white man mav
overdo the taking of bucdens and fill his international
concert with discord.

EDITOR CAI/L: In the Bulletin of this evening we observe a statement
that there was a rumor current that Auditor Wells had decided to withhold
from Thomas J. Graham, Superior Judse, his monthly salary of $333 1-3,
pending the determination of the contest for the office now- carried on in
JudRC Murasky's court. While deferentially bowing to the superior wisdom
of the evenlnp organ and of the Auditor, we respectfully submit that the
Auditor will do noilunp: of the kind, for, under the constitution (see section
17, article VI), but one-half of the salary of each Superior Judge is paid by
the county, the other half beine paid by the State. And we may add as our
conclusion that the Auditor Is not even authorized to stoo the half paid by
the county during the pendency of the contest and the appeal in the Supreme
Court.
While -it is true that it was provided by section 936 of the Political Code
hat "when the title of the Incumbent of any omceMn this Slate is contested
by proceedings instituted in any court for that purpose, nc warrant can
thereafter be drawn or paid for any part of his salary until such proceedings
have been finally,, determined." it is also true that the above section was
amended by -an act of. the Legislature, approved March 10, 1S31 (see Statutes
of 1S91, pp. 2S and 29), which said amendment reads n's follows: "Provided,
however, that this section shall not be construed to apply to any party to
a contest or proceeding now pending or hereafter instituted who holds the
certificate of election or commission of office and discharges the duties of the
offlce; but such party shall receive the salary of such office, the same as if
no contest or proceeding was pending," which clearly goes to show that un
til the final and adverse determination by the Supreme Court on appeal, tho
incumbent is absolutely entitled to the salary of the office.
Respectfully submitted,

to be able to offer to its subscribers an
atlas so indorsed. Â«
In the first place the atlas is published
by the premier map-making firm of
(jeorfre V. Cram & Co., an'd in producing
it for introduction into the twentieth cen
tury the publishers have spared no effort.
Its maps are absolutely accurate and up

from the charts of the RoyaJ Geocraph-
One dollar and a half in cash and six

have been asked to pay. from $>> to $10 for
a first-class atlas, and are surprised as
well as pleased to have offered to them
a work so complete* and of such high
merit on such easy crrms.
In addition to the m.ios, there is a
chronology giving in order dates anrt
facts in American history from 9S6 to the
present time; there is a reliable digest of
the history of political parties. Another
feature mifrht justly be styled "An Bncy
clopedin. of History and Geography," as
in condensed space it gives briefly: the
area, population, physical features, gov
ernment, religion, education, army an'l
navy defences, industries, climate, etc.,
of every State. Territory and foreign
country of the world.
ical Society of London. There are 170
maps of modern geography and forty-six
maps and plans of l\u-. principal citie3 of
the world. .
The visiting Britisher is of course young and fool
ish or she would not have undertaken to criticize a
society she does not understand; but in view of the
Cleveland incident she has a just right to ask whether
there be any one who understands it.
If, as appears from the report, the detectives were
as well bred, as well dressed and as skilled in dancing
as the guests at the function, why should they not be
permitted to dance, .md why should the social set be
aghast because they did? If we are to have a demo
cratic society so free in every respect that millionaires
have to employ detectives to watch the guests at a
reception and keep an eye on the spoons, then surelv
the detectives are not worse than other folks in the
crowd, and the young men who introduced them to
the belles are not to be blamed. If, on the other hand,
we are not to have such democracy in society, then
why should there be detectives and why should men.
in the social swim deem it proper to introduce un
krown men to the ladies of their acquaintance?
The showing made by the item from Cleveland jus
tifies the statements of the visiting critic. Certainly
detectives are not invited to dance at "swell functions"
in European capitals. The one question, then, for
the controversialists to decide is whether such invi
tations are right or wrong.
The issue is rendered interesting by the coincidence
of a social item going the rounds of the very papers
that arc roasting the critic of Washington. The item,
as recorded in the New York Press, runs thus:
'"Cleveland society, the feminine part of it, is aghast
at the knowledge that many of its members danced
with detectives at Ru:h Hanna's coming-out party in
the Chamber of Commerce building on New Year's
night. It has been learned that, in addition to half
a dozen city detectives who attended the party, about
fifty private detectives in dress suits were among the
party. They mingled with guests and appeared to
great advantage. It was so large a party that it was
impossible that everybody should know with whom to
dance, and some of the young Clevelanders, who
thought it would be fun, introduced several of the
sleuths to the young society women in the party. The
detectives were willing and anxious to dance, and as
their instructions were to mingle with the guests they
mingled completely."'
The publication of the letter has naturally given
rise to a good deal of comment in the East, and par
ticularly in those centers where the people are in the
habit of looking upon Western men and women as
wild and woolly and speaking scornfully of Western
nu.nne.rs. These folks are offended that a stranger
from the effete drawing-rooms of London should find
i'i them much the same fault they- think they find in
us, and accordingly with much iteration they are as
suring themselves that they are all right and the vis
iting English woman is "too cruel."
AN English woman residing in Washington re
cently wrote for the London Chronicle an ac
count of society in the United States as seen
by a stranger at the .capitdi. After pronouncing us to
be a "conglomerate of all races," she notes that our
society is not versed in the etiquette 'of European
drawing-rooms, arid goes on to say: â¢"Whether the
lack. of polish in many instances is due to an ignorance
of the rudiments of. refined life, the effects .of the
boasted common school training where all classes
n:eet on. a. common level, or an affected indifference
to what we cal|, polite usage, it is difficult to say.
Whatever be the cause, the disheartening fact remains
that outside the circle of a few thousands of cultured
people in each of the great centers, and proportion
ally less for the smaller' towns and villages, there are
few who would not become the cynosure of all eyes
and the center of all manner of criticism in any capi
ta! in Europe."

The decennial census of the Lnlted
Kingdom will be taken the eomlnjr spring,
beginning March 31. According to the ad
vance estimates issued by the . British
Registrar General, the population of the
United Kingdom should be 41,297.000. a to
tal increase of 3.193.O0O or 8.40 per cent
since 1S9L. This estimate foreshadows a
decline, since 3.40 per cent is 3.15 less ln

3.56 under the lowest percentage of in

train boy is to be abolished after January
1. The train boy is a survival of an era
in railroading that Is now practically ob
solete, and though he had his uses in
times that are past, he is now almost as
unnecessary an adjunct to a modern rail
way train as Is the handbrake or a linen
"duster"â that pride of the traveler of the
era in which the train boy was at the

EDITORIAL
UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
GOVERNOR GAGE'S message is wholly de
voted to the business of the State. Since the
days of Governor Irwin no other riiessagc has
gone into such painstaking detail in discussing all the
varied interests of the State which are confided to
public authority. The income of the State is derived
from the taxation of its property and people. The
outgo of the State is for the maintenance of its gov
ernment, the preservation of public order, the protec
tion of person and property necessary to the growth
end prosperity of the commonwealth, and in caring
for its defective, indigent and helpless population.
The Governor begins his message with an obser
vation admonitory of the Legislature, which has the
clearness and force of an axiom. Impressing upon
the members the necessity of care in legislating, hi
says: "The evil of an individual, as a rule, affects him
aione. for his power of injuring the few around him
can be summarily restrained: but the wrong of a bad
law affects the whole community, and its poison may
spread before discovery, and the injury may be irre-.
parable, though afterward annulled by the decision of
a court, or repealed by act of a future Legislature." i
Attention is called to the tax exemptions provided
by the amendments to the constitution adopted by th?
people at the last election. The exemption of church
and university property shifts its burden of taxation
upon non-exempt property, so that the least extrava
gance in appropriation must necessarily be reflected
in an increase of the tax rate. Perhaps this view of
the amendments did not impress the people when
they were adopted. But it is clear that exemption
from tax of such a considerable body of property must
be followed by increase of rate.
The Governor urges abstention from creating fur
ther salaried offices and positions, and recommends
that the Legislature begin by restricting its own em
ployes to a useful minimum. /
The message enters fully into the successful efforts
of the Governor to save the State from the ruin of its
materialities by the bubonic plague scare. We think
he makes a complete and unanswerable demonstra
tion that the plague never appeared here, and that the
Federal Government should now avert a future injury
from the same source by a change in the quarantine
office.
Aroused to the importance of scientific accuracy in
such matters, because a quarantine against the State
brings loss and sacrifice to every interest of the peo
ple, the Governor recommends in terms "the exten
sion of the powers of the State Board of Health, so
that its dignity may be raised in proportion to its
importance, and that the most eminent physicians
may be proud to occupy a place in the board or act
under its supervision and direction. I recommend
that in the matter of bubonic plague or plague sus
pects, as well as in all other dangerous, epidemic, con
tagious and infectious diseases, the State Board of
Health have for State purposes full control and
supervision of all county, city and county, city and
town Boards o'f Health and medical officers, with a
right to demand at all times a report from such
boards and officers icspecting epidemic, contagious
and infectious diseases." /
This is an excellent and practical recommendation.
What is the use of a State Board of Health with no
jurisdiction and no authority? If local health bodies
may claim exclusive jurisdiction in each city, town
and county, admitting the State Board to their coun
cils only on sufferance, it is a useless appendage of
the government. But, endowed with general and
superior and paramount jurisdiction and power to en
force it. the health of the State will have some se
curity against the spread of epidemic?, and the inter
ests of the people will be protected against the spread
o; lying reports.
As to such reports the Governor recommends a
drastic remedy by declaring it a felony for any per
son or corporation to publish or procure to be pub
lished within this State any false report of the pres
ence of bubonic plague within this State, and that it
be likewise declared a felony for any person or cor
poration within this State to publish or procure to
be published outside the State such false report. That
will be called a serious remedy, but it is a serious
offense â one that visits upon every interest the actual
consequences of the plague in the absence of the dis
?The message commends the university to the care
of the Legislature, mentions gratefully the benefac
tions thereto of Mrs.. Hearst, and deals with all the
official relations of the State to the people.
A BUSINESS MESSAGE.
It is to be borne in mind our forests have to sup
ply not only our own needs, but a considerable de
mand from Europe.' Wood fiber is coming into us
for many kinds of articles, and consequently the de
mand for it is expanding much more rapidly than is
supposed by the general public. In view of all these
things it might be said that for the nation as well as
for New Hampshire forest salvation is the paramount
issue. California, at any rate, should profit by the
warning given in New England.

Understanding that Caliban Is partly a
child and In part an adult, he may be
examined with reference to his eqtirp
ment with respect to artistic, moral and
intellectual functioning. The fullness ot
his sensory experience has already been
commented upon. In a few instances
these sensations m,erge into esthetic per
ceptionsâas when he looks out over the
sea and observes the sunbeams weaving
upon the surface a spider web of fire into
which some great fish breaks at times,
ruffling the meshes and causing 1 the dusk
shadows to play amid the light. HÂ» has
the Imagination that reaches thÂ© Quiet,
and that affects the symbolic quality of
his speech. He figures the wind as
shouldering the pillared dust. He says
he wove wattles to fence In tortoises, then
a wave of the sea, feeling the foot of
faetebos upon Its neck, gasped as a snake
does, lolled out its tongue and licked the
whole labor flat. According to bis means
nÂ© Is a creative artist. He piles turf, pro
portions thÂ© structure,- decorates it with
squares of soft white chalk, scratching
upon them the image of the moon, seta up
on the piles some spikes of trees and.
crowns the whole with the gleaming skull
ot a sloth. This Is done, hÂ© says, solely
for the pleasure of the work, the Joy of
creation.
Not less complete, according to his evo
lution, is Caliban's moral equipment. His
moral motives axe both hate and fear.
His mother had taught him to love Sete
bos, but as hate is hii chief expÂ«rience
he can conceive of God only as a god of
pain. Nevertheless, he has conceptions
of right and wrong. He knows he
should be at work for Prospero and that
it 13 not right to gibe at Setebos. Fear
or punishment recalls him to hiraself. and
under conviction of sin he promises refor
mation. When the storm breaks upon
nlra and the fierce thunder threatens
him he seeks to appease the angry god of
the skies by promises of loving and fast
ing and praying.
As a rational being Caliban was prob
ably in advance of his time, and leads
the revolt against current orthodoxy In
one point of dispute at leastâ the belief in
life after death. His mother held the
opinion that Setebos feasted friends and
punished enemies in heaven and hell. But
Caliban argues that pain ends with death
He appears thus as a primitive scientist
and bases hia thinking upon observation
and experience. He has conceived al
ready some notion of causation. He dis
tinguishes between the system of things
he knowsâ the sun and moon, meteors,
clouds, the winds, the sea and its islands,
all elements that come within the circle
of a single influenceâ and the stars that
belong in their infinite quietude to an
other rule. Within the sphere of his ob

also as a symbol, gave him a subordinate

Required Heading: Shakespeare's
"Tempest," Browning's "Caliban
Upon Sstebos."
I propose in this paper to compare
Shakespeare's and Browning's treatment
of the savage Caliban, in order to show
the 'progress made in three centuries In
the dramatic treatment of life. *\t first
thought the comparison seems unfair,
since in one case Caliban is subordinated
to the- conduct of a complicated play,
while in the other ca^o ho seems to occu
py thÂ© stage alone. But It will appear
from a study of Browning's poem that in
reality Caliban is the ?ame slave of Pros
pero and all the conditions of the piay
may be Implied in the poÂ«m. But it i<Â»
to be observed furtner that the indlvldu
alization of Caliban Is one of the change*
that has taken place in tho period tinder
review.
This, then, is the Image of Caliban on
Shakespeare's stage: He is a strange mis
shapen, creature, half nsh, half man. He
was fathered by a devil and a witch gave
him birth. He was reared in solitude. He
gabbled until Prospero taught him speech.
Food and drink and sensual pleasures
alone attracted him. His senses are keen
ly perceptive and ho knows, where tho
best thinss on the .island may be found.
He listened to dreams and heard the mu
sic of spirits. When it thundered he grov
eled In fear of Setebos. â¢ He slaved for
Prospero when compelled by aches and
pains. He was rebellious when the oppor
tunity came to get Â«Â» better master. He
realized the significance of punishment
and could repent of vnongdoinj. Within
the compass of his savage nature he was
not altogether unpoetlca.1 and compares
well with the degraded Stephano and the
foolish Trinculo. Although a brute, ho
approximates the attributes of a man. I
suppose that Shakespeare had merely a
dramatic Interest in this brute-man. Tho
conception of such a one would naturaily
arise with the idea ol a desert island.
From the play we catch echoes of travel
ers' tales of the islands of the sea am!
their savage inhabitants. Among contem
porary publications were the histories of
Sir Walter Raleigh and Richard Hakluyc,
Purchass' "Pilgrimage'.' and Richard
Kden's account of the voyage of Magellan
in the south fcas. Tfte facts about sav
age races were just then becoming known
to the English people. For the first tlmo
tho poet with his world-wide curiosity
could set forth upon the stage the lowest
tvpe of man. For th* tirst time, indestl,
he could picture the variety of the human
kind: Ariel belonging to the land of
faery, a spirit of the air; Caliban, in far
contrast the basest representative of tho
earth, a brute emerging from the mud
It was doubtless Shakespeare's motive to
give both types a place and meaning in
his play of enchantment. I would not
deny that he had a ctrtaln scientific mo
tive in showing the world his idea of an
evolutionary growth Intermediate between
brute and man.
â¢ Now Browning's Caliban is the same
pictiiresc,iu<? slave of Prospero â and some
thing more. Without losing anything of
objective force Browning delineates the
savage subjectively. Sprawling in the
cool' slush of his cave and surrounded by
the abundant life of summer, Caliban
looks out over the ocean where sunbeams
cross and recross till they weave a
spider's web of tire and longs for the solu
tion of a mysteryâ no longer the "mere
slave of a master, but in a natural and
independent way, questioning in regard
to the existence and nature of Setebos,
whom his dam calls God. His thoughts
are busy with the problems of evil and
pain. Setebos, he thinks, rules and vexes
man in spite and sport. Above Setebos
Is the Quiet, which the lower god apes,
and unable to reach the other's happy
life takes his solace in make-believes. In
the Tempest we saw the Caliban form;
here we see more of the Caliban soul.
The difference" in "the two poety" por
trayal of the savage nature measures the
growth of three centuries. , The renais
sance of the sixteenth century was largely
physical; that of the nineteenth century
has been spiritual. Whereas Shakespeare
might present life In its outward mani
festation Browning is enabled to show
man thinking, feeling and struggling for
spiritual gains. Browning's work, in
short, is baaed upon a deeper psychology.
In Â«other respects of science Browning
represents nn immense advance. He had
at his service the new . sciences of an
thropology and folk-lore. He was able to
appropriate the modern truth of evolu
tion. For it is now known that both life
and thought are evolutions from lower
forms. As life has assumed in series ever
higher and higher embodiment, so his
tory. Institutions, constitutions and cus
toms are the result of ideas which have
been developing from the beginning of
human experience. LJfc and belief are
both vital processes. Development by
natural and artifical selection of the fittest
organism and the fittest belief is the
modern formula of life and opinion. The
Caliban of the sixteenth century gains in
finitely in meaning when his kind are
seen to be the progenitors of the human
forms amid which he grovels. No one
present on that stage â not Prospero or
Alonso or Ariel â was aware of the rela
tionship. We look upon life with different
eyes, a new interest attaches to every
stage of the process, now that science
has dis-closed the chain by which the last
Is linked to the first and how the lowest
moves forward to the highest. The new
interest in Caliban as modernly known is,
then, two-fold: An interest in his per
sonality or inner experience and an Inter
est in the place of that experience in the
evolution of man. Browning approaches
his subject from this point of view and
his poem is illumined fully by the evolu
tionary idea.
It will be important now to know *Just
what Browning's treatment of the savage
is. His Caliban exhibits the characteris
tics of a primitive man â but how prim
itive and to what stage of evolution does
he belong? It Is noticeable that sensa
tions form the chief facts of his experi
ence. He is especially sensitive in the
sense of touchâ the lowest of the fiveâ as
is seen, by his love of the cool mud In the
warm summer time. It is evident that
his energy has been expended in physi
cal paths. He Is keenly observant, know
ing the habits of animals, the growth of
plants and the temper ft the sea.
Perfected in the lower ranges of senso
ry equipment, he is notably defective in
respect of self-consciousness. He speaks
of himself in the third person in a child
ish manner. He becomes aware of hisln
dlviduality under two conditions. First,
he becomes Intoxicated, realizing In this
excess of sensation some Increase of con
sciousness, with no more harmful effect
than becoming wanton and wishing he
were born a bird. Had he Increased the
measure of his mash and honeycomb and
pods, probably he would have risen Into
that state of ecstacy which accompanies
the performance of religious rites among
all primitive peoples. The, personal pro
noun is also employed when he makes
something or compares himself with ob
jects, the act- of making and comparing 1
giving him Integrity and conscious char
acter.
Another childish trait Is disclosed in his
imltativeness. He watches Prospero and
Imitates his master's world with baubles.
He makes a book of leaves and writes
therein prodigious words and symbols,
cuts a .branch from a tree for a magic
wand, wears a beast's skin for an en
chanter's robe, tames an ounce and says
she is Miranda, keeps for Ariel a crane
and for a Caliban and slave seizes a sea
bird which he Minds and lames and pens
in the rocks to <',rudge. Such childish con
duct Indicates his degree of personal evo
lution.
It is correct to call Caliban primitive,
but it may now be observed that he is in
reality quite old in racial history. He Is
free-minded on his own part, yet not so
liberal as to be free from traditions and
associations that belong to racial life. He
has been taught of what his dam calls
God and of this god^he mother has been
taught by her dam, and so back for un
told generations. .Already the general
tenets of his belief are formed by trad'
tlon. Caliban Is a moon-worshiper, but
he did not invent moon-worship. That
was one of his racial traditions. His ref
erence to the raven, also, as -the spy of
Setebos, points to his attachment to a
wide social group. For there is nothing
more extensive in primitive life than this
fear of the raven.; which was somehow a
sign of deity. Â¦ Thus associated the raven

Question of Hours Is the Cause of the Split Between the
Shipowners and the Labor Organization.
POPE & TALBOT and the Sea^
men's Union of the Pacific are at
outs. For nearly a generation the
big firm of lumber dealers and
shipowners has lived at peace
with the union, byt now the sailors have
insisted upon rertain demands which the
firm declines to grant and the trouble is
on. â¢ Â¦
Pope & Talbot control one of the largest
fleet of coasters sailing from San Fran
cisco. All their vessels were manned by
union men, union wages have been inva
riably paid and union rules observer). As
a result the firm's vessels were generally
the best manned on the coast.
The trouble began on the ship America
on PuRot Sound, however. The crow on
that vessel were worked overtime and
the captain refused to pay more than the
ordinary wages. It Is hard to gauge a
day's work on a lumber vessel, as at some
ports the mills close down at 5 p. m.,
while at others they run until C p. m. Now
an hour moans a whole lot in the loading
or unloading of a ship, and it was on that
rock the union and Pope & Talbot split.
The union insisted upon inserting a nine
hour clause In the articles, and Pope &
Talbot would not consent. In conse
quence all of the firm's vessels will go out
with non-union crews until the difference
is settled.

Ship Two Brothers Springs a Leak

The ship Two Brothers, bound from Ta

put in here last Tuesday night in distress.
She was caught in the gale that caused
so much damage, but apparently escaped
unhurt. However, on December 23. when

Harbor Commissioners Meet.
There was not much business done at
the meeting of the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners yesterday. Chief Engineer
Holmes submitted plans and specifications
for a nc-w dolphin between slips 4 and 5 of
the ferry approaches. Sheds are to be put
up in tha,t vicinity ami other improve
ments made. Tho plans were approved
and bids for tho work will lie called for.
Attorney K. B. Younp appeared before
the board on behalf of the creditors ot
Bateman Brovs. The latter tlrm has a
claim against the commission for extra
work and the creditors want tho money.
Nothing was done, as the Commissioners
have paused the matter up to the Board
Chief Steward Is Honored.
There were f-ome pleasant reunions on
the transport Grant during her run from
Manila. Christmas and New Year's
days were spent at sea. but all
aboard had a pleasant time. The children
had a Christmas tree and extra fare was
nroviileil for all hands by Chief Steward
\\\ Herhert. In consequence lie brings
back to port with him three testimonials
find twenty tlir.es as many expressions of
Kood will. The llrst testimonial Is headed
by Mrs. General Funston; the second by
Captain Smedley I>. Uutler, U. S. M. C.'.
fj>n of Senator Butler, and the third by
Mrs. II. B. P.-iddock. wife of Captain Pad
dock of the Sixteenth Cavalry. Judging
Of the entertainment by the Grant's hill
of fare for Christmas day, the passengers
did not mips much by being 1000 mile*
from nowhere.
Is This Another Joke?
A letter received at the ferry station
yesterday is looked upon by the police
as a ghastly, joke. It reads as follows:
January S.
Whoever finds this Mter please place it In
the hands of the police. Despondency has
driven nw to commit suicide. My body will
be found Sn Golden Gate Park.
JIM McGRATH, City.
The matter was turned over to Captain
Dunlevy of the Harbor Police, but he
does not place much credence in the let
ter.
Captain Tribble Exonerated.
Captains Bolles and Bulger. United
States local inspectors of hulls and boil
ers, have exonerated Captain. W. T. Tria
ble of the bay steamer Sausalito in Ihe
matter of the collision last October be
tween the steamer and the yacht Queen.
They found that the Queen was racing
and bumped into the port quarter of the
steamer, breaking the yacht's bowsprit.
Maritime Libel Filed.
Martin R. Roberts filed a libel in the
United States District Court yesterday
against the scow schooner Howard and
Kspinoso de los Monteros to recover pos
session of the schoontr from Monteros.
who, it is alleged in the complaint, ille
gally ousted Roberts from the possession
thereof.
A libel was filed In the same court by
Antonio Ramirez and others of the crew
of the fcteamship Mexico to recover $1001
wages and damages for breach of con
tract.
Point Arena Suit Ended.
A Jury In . the United States Circuit
Court yesterday returned a verdict for
$250 for the land and J1000 damages against
the Government in thÂ« matter of thft con
demnation of two acres of land tt Point

Lucie's Goose 'Brings Misfortune.
United States Court Commissioner Hea
eock yesterday dismissed the case of the
United States vs. Captain Jefferson of the
Helensburg, charged with smuggling
eighteen bottles of Scotch whisky into
Pat Lucle's saloon at Crockett. The cap
tain showed that thÂ© whisky had been en
tered on the ship's manifest as captain's
stores. There were two cases of eighteen
bottles eacfi. When his vessel was board
ed by the Customs officials at Port Costa
one of the cases of eighteen bodies was
missing. Nine bottles were found on sale
In L-ucie's saloon. Lucle explained that
he received the whisky In exchange for a
fat goose and a bottle of rye presented by
him to the captain's wife. The captain
made Lucie a present, as he had a right
to do, and was not aware that Lucle would
offer the goods for sale. Lucle's case was
continued.

An attorney and public speaker, who
had been a catarrh sufferer for years,
says: #
"Every fall I would catch a cold, which
would settle in my head and throat and
hang on all winter long, and every winter
It seemed to get a little worse. I waa con-
tinually clearing my throat and my voice
became affected to such an extent as to
Interfere with my public speaking.
"I tried troches and cheap cough cures
and sometimes got relief, but only for a
short time, until this winter, when I
learned of the new catarrh cure, Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets*, through a newspaper ad-
vertisement. Two fifty-cent boxes which
I bought at my druggist's cleared my head
and throat In fine shape, and to guard
against a return of my old trouble I keep
a box of the tablets on hand, and when-
ever I catch a little cold I take a tablet
or two and ward off any serious develop-
ments."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets deserve to head
the list as a household remedy to checx
and break up coughs and colds, because
unlike many other catarrh and cough
cures, these tablets contain no opiate,
cocaine or any injurious drug.
Dr. Mclverriey advises catarrh sufferers
to use a new preparation, sold by drug-
gists, called Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, be-
cause actual analysis has shown these
tablets to contain certain antiseptic Qual-
ities of the highest value, and being an
internal remedy, pleasant to the taste,
convenient and harmless, can be used as
freely as required, as well for children ai
for adulta.
Catarrh is undoubtedly a blood disease
and can only be successfully eradicated
by an internal treatment. Sprays, washes
and powders are useless as far as reach-
ing the real seat of the disease is coa-
cerned.
Catarrh of the throat and bronchial
tubes as well as catarrh of the stomach
and liver are almost as common as nasal
catarrh and generally more difficult to
cure.
Catarrh Is at home anywhere and every-
\rhere. While more common ln cold,
changeable climates. It la by no means
confined to them, but Is prevalent ln every
State and Territory ln the Union.
The common definition of catarrh Is a
chronic cold in the head, which It long:
neglected often destroys the sense of smell
and hearing; but there are many other
forms of the disease, even more obstinate
and dangerous.
Catarrh Is Found Everywhere.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Jan. 9.â The Board of Trade ex
perienced another whlpsaw market to-day.
Trade was largely professional and the pit
feeling nervous. May opened %Â©Hc to *jc
lewer on disappointing Liverpool cables. North
west receipts were moderate and on covering
by shorts t..e market rallied early to 7S s 4c
{ After this action a decline followed and the
I market for a period fluctuated narrowly, with
I the tone steady. Later the liberal aggregate
j of primary receipts, 664, 0C0 bushels, against
630,000 last year, combined with the falling off
ir. outside support, caused ' a break from 73%C
to 77 l Â£c, and the close was weak, %fi%c lower,
at 77}; c
Corn was fairly active and strong. Unset
tled weather was a factor in the strength.
There was a good commission house demand
und fair covering during the afternoon by
shorts. May clfsed >Â»Â»c higher at 38%@38%c
Oats were quiet under the Influence of other
grains. Tlie close was rather easy. May closed
a shade lower at 25%@25Hc.
Provisions were moderately active and strong.
The market opened higher In sympathy with
higher prices at the yards, despite heavy hog
receipts, and advanced on a general good de
mand, closing with most of ' the gain held.
May pork closed 15c higher, lard 12^c up and
ribs 12%c up.

Nii'.v TORK. Jan. 8.â After a short prellm-

bull characteristics. There was a prompt and
striking response to any demonstration of
strength, the leafier* finding no difficulty la
running rrics up by rapid stages several points

Influence cr these easy advances exercised bo
â¢tror.g a 6'jstaJr.ing influence ca the rest of the

bean who so'.d the market In the conviction
that the culmination of the rise had been
reached and with the reported Illness of the
President might prove a deciding factor la pre
cipitating a reaction were forced to cover In
Â¦orae disorder. The sustained strength In the
market cannot be entirely accorded without
making due allow ance for the persistence of u.
very large short interest and the present stage
of the riee. The demand for fcorrowed stocks
Is proof of the existence of the short Interest.
More cr lew difficulty Is experienced In secur

FIRST STEPS TOWARD
BROAD GAUGE SYSTEM
ALAMEDA, Jan. 9.â Southern Pacific
engineers commenced surveying: to-day for
the third rail which will bo laid along: the
route of the narrow gauge local line pre
paratory to turning It Into a broad gauge
system. After the surveys have been com
pleted, which will take a month, the work
of laying the third rail will commence at

months broad gauge trains will have dis
placed the narrow gauge trains. The

VISITS OAKLAND
Makes a Quiet Trip Over
the Important Local
Lines.
ments.
West Oakland Yards With
an Eye to Improve-
Inspects the Ferry Service and the
The matter of increased ferry service at
certain times of the day, of increased ser
vice to Berkeley and Oakland and of in
creased facilities at the Oakland mole and
the West Oakland yards were mentioned
as likely to require attention before a
great while. The plan for the proposed
Increase in the ferry service to twenty
minute trips on the broad-gauge . route,
which has been perfected for some time,
but has never ben put into operation, was
explained. , .
The trip was purely one of Inspection
so that the new head of the company
might know something. of the local condi
tions that surround the lines under his
control and that he might familiarize him
self with the local geography. Tho party
returned to San Francisco in the evening
without making any comments upon the
conditions existing.
The peculiarities of the local traffic
upon this side of the bay, the heavy
crowds in the morning and evening and
light crowds during the day. were ex
plained to the new president by Mr.
Palmer and Mr. Wilder.
From there the party went over the
Seventh-street line to East Oakland,
around through Alameda, and then back
to the pier, from which point a start was
made to Berkeley. A careful inspection
of tho Berkeley branch was made be
cause the travel is growing so rapidly
upon this line that some increase In the
service will have to be made shortly.
The first visit' was made to the West
Oakland railroad yards, the headquarters
of the repairing for the division. Mr.
Hays was taken through the shops to the
shipyard, where the ferry steamers are re
paired, and the Peralta-street slip, from
which point the freight ferry starts. This
Is the main artery by which overland
freight- reaches and leaves San Francisco
and is most important to the entire sys
tem.
President Hays wanted to make a com
plete inspection of the local system to
East Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley in
order to find out something about the
lines under his management on this side
of the bay. The Oakland local system Is
the most complex under the control of the
Southern Pacific Company and is one of
the most valuable income producers con
nected with the big railroad.
President Hays left San Francisco on
the 12:30 o'clock boat in company with
General Manager Kruttschnitt, arriving
at the Oakland pier shortly before 1
o'clock. They were met at the pier by
Assistant J}Jvlsion Superintendent ,W. S.
Palmer and Division Trainmaster J. C.
Wilder with a special engine and . one
coach. Division Superintendent James
Agler was not in Oakland and could not
Join the party.
C. M. Hays, the new president of tho
Southern Pacific Company, made his first
visit to Oakland to-day. He spent the
entire afternoon going over the local sys
tem of the road and returned to San
Francisco in the evening.

INTERESTS, THE COAST.
Albert Cullen Bray Seems Destined at
Last to Find a Permanent
Home.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9.â It Is seldom
that a child three years of age is called
upon to have its name changed three
times within a year. Such, however, is
the lot that has fallen to Albert Cullen
Bray.
About a year ago the child's parents
disagreed and a suit for divorce followed.
Mrs. Bray was gTanted a decree on the
ground of cruelty. She was awarded tho
custody of Albert. Shortly afterward
Mrs. Bray consented, to the adoption of
her child by Blanche M. Taylor and the
court entered a decree to that effect. Two
weeks later the father, Archie Bray, filed
a petition asking that the appointment be
revoked. He claimed his consent had not
been obtained and that Mrs. Bray had ex

Says That While, the Encounters May
Be Called "Boxing Matches,"
They Ara Against the
Law.
-4 â :
NEW YORK, Jan. 9.â In his charge to
the Grand Jury at Paterson, N. J., Jus
tice Dlxon directed the attention of the
jurors to "boxing matches" and instruct
ed them to bring indictments. He said:'
"It Is regarded as a sort of common
sport in the various sections of the coun
try, and perhaps Passalc County is *not
free from that sport. It is a demoralising
influence and there are certainly quite
enough of, those influences in the com
munity, and those to whom the enforce
ment of the laws Is intrusted cannot dis
charge their duty better than by exercis
ing whatever power they have in the sup
pression of those various Influences, Our
statutes render prize fighting a misde
meanor not only by those who actually
encage In the fight, but in all those who
aid and abet It. and all those who volun
tarily witness It. Now these encounters
do not go by the name of prize fights.
They are known as 'boxing 1 matches,'
â¢displays of pugilistic skill,' and things of
that sort. There Is no doubt there may
be a boxing match which is not a prize
fight, but, so far as my Information goes,
none of these exhibitions of fistic skill
are anything else than prize fights, for
the object of those who engage In themâ
the object of eachâ is to disable each oth
er, and whenever that is the object it
is a tight, call It by whatever name you
will. It Is the characteristic of -a fight
that two men engage in an effort with
their hands to injure each other. So that
if you find evidence of such exhibitions
anywhere within the county it would be
your plain duty to indict the participants
engaged In the encounter, those who have
aided and abetted it, and those who have
voluntarily witnessed It. I trust that in
this matter you will do your duty."

"Boxing might have been going on In

that one of the contestants had no possi

He cited the JetTries-Sharkey bout,
which he said "should have been stopped

WISE LANDLADY.
Understands How to Increase Her
Business.
The landlady of a certain restaurant la
Brockton, Mass., has Increased her bUKl-
r.ess so rapidly that fihe has hajd to en-
large her dining-room to .accommodate
the continually increasing patronage. One
of her *ruests elves the reason.
"Every morning she serves her regular
"jru'ests with Grape-Kcts and hot milk or
hot cream in cold weather, and cold cream
In eummer. I began eating this food and
right away began to feel an Improvement
in my health. I had been terribly trou-
bled with nervousness and dyspepsia and
found It impossible to find a food that
would agree â¢with me, until I began board-
ins at this restaurant.
"TnrÂ» new food, in four months, in-
creased my weight from 120 pounds to 143
and I never felt as wt'l In my life aa I
do row. There is sorr/etbing remarkable
In the Fustainine power of this food. I
have never been able to obtain such re-
cults from any other." G. R. Hersey. 30

THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
NO other feature of the sport at I
Oakland track yesterday, aroused I
so much interest as the third
kindergarten speed recital.
Twelve "baby" racers galloped
to the post with both Eastern, and Cali
fornia sires represented. Over a dash of
three furlongs through splashy mud the
youngsters trudged, with the winner turn
ing up in Walter Jennings' showy look
ing Prestano. a son of Imp. Prestonpona
and Katie Fletcher." On his first attempt
the Jennings entry looked the best, Btill
6 and 8 to 1 was laid in the eaxly betting.
When Caldwell sent the dozen away Dr.
Scharff outbroke tho others, leading well
into the stretch. Mounce then drew.the
whip on Prestano, the' two-year-old re
sponding like a veteran, collaring and
beating the Doctor out a length. Sol
Ldchtenstein. owned by Bam Hlldreth and
well bet on, came from behind, just beat
ing Mike Murphy a head for the show.
The latter is a son of Yankee VDoodle and
has been doing well in private and ran
a Bwagger race.
There was a largo crowd present, bount
ifully supplied with money. -Favorites
were unprofitable to follow, as but two,
Katie Gibbons and Rollick, landed first.
Unquestionably the presence of O Con
nor on her back made Katie Gibbons first
choice for the introductory overture. LJt
tle Minch Jr. headed the Honig castpff
into the stretch, when she gradually
edged to the front, beating the outsider
easily. Dunboy, a 30 to 1 shot, ran third.
Through a series of miscues Kiley at
the wheel aboard tho 3 to 5 chance Meeha
r.us, in the six and a half furlong sprint,
failed to get" Inside the money. J. Daly
on Prestidigitator made all the running,
winning easing up from Wallensteln, an
outsider. O'Connor astride the latter cut
off the favorite on the back stretch, after
which the Hildreth horse was never prom
inent. A deal of smart money went in on
the winner, the price at one stage ot the
betting being 6 to L
Had some other pilot than O Connor
been up on Rollick the black mare Neck
lace might have taken the fourth purse.
Mounce had her out in front until well
on toward the wire, when O'Connor
hustled the Burns & Waterhouse gelding
along, winning by half a length.
terer, which ran fourth, will do better
with a stronger boy than J. Daly on his
back. Rollick closed a 9 to 6 choice.
A nonsensical ride beat Bernota, post
favorite for the mile and fifty yard event,
decided under selling conditions, with
only a "catch" to carry. J. Ransch, under
wraps on Bernota. allowed. Sybaris to
make the running. When it came to cut
ting loose In the run home, O'Connor, witn
Horton, easily outflnished Ransch, reach
ing the wire first by two lengths. Sybaris
took the show. â¢ 'Â¦ *j_
Saintly, at odds of * to 1, captured the
last race of the day, at five and a half
furlongs. Johnny Woods got away well,
and holding Nora Ives eafe, won handily
by a length from Osmond. Casdale. the
favorite, never had much chance, as Bu
chanan got away in the rear of the bunch.
Track Notes.
The Judges were not fully satisfied with
the showing made by Meehanus, and are
investigating the ride of Kiley.
Ed Laurence, assistant secretary of the
Crescent City Jockey Club, left for New
Orleans yesterday. .
O'Connor carried off the saddle honors
by riding three winners.
Jim Neil owns a half interest in Mike
Murphy.
Barney Schrelber completed arrange
ments yesterday by which "Jimmy" Cof
foy will probably train his. crack Eastern
string, headed by Bannockburn. Jimmy
is a most careful, conscientious and pains
taking trainer, and the St. Louis layer of
odds made no mistake in his selection.

armed, but not before having his hand cut

i her he me at Toti Ivy avenue. Although she
! had been ailing for several weeks, her
j condition was not considered serious until

Schwiels listened attentively to the
story of the young fellow and when the
latter asked him to take a walk the un
suspecting man from Lake County fool
ishly consented. After walking several
blocks the bunko steerer stopped in front
of a lodging-house in the vicinity of Post
street and Grant avenue, and, after tell
ing Schwiels that he was anxious to see a
friend who lived in the place, he asked
him to accompany him to his room.
Of course, Schwiels had no objection and
together they went to a room on the up
per iloor. As Schwiels entered he was
surprised to see three men engaged in a
friendly game of poker. After a brief
conversation Schwiels' new found friend
was induced to take a hand, despite the
protest of the man from Lake County.
The first, "hand" dealt Schwiels'
"friend" was three aces and a pair of
deuces. Feigning surprise, he called
Schwiels ana showing him his hand he
asked him what he thought of it.
Schwiels expressed the belief that it was
the winning one and advised his "friend"
to bet it for all it was worth. After get
ting all his money into the "pot" the
bunko steerer turned to Schwiels and
asked him to advance him some money on
the hand as he was sure that it. would
win. Schwiels reached for his wallet
and taking out $70 in gold handed it to his
"friend." When the hands were shown
down Schwiels was startled to find that
the man who was betting against his
"friend" held foujr 1 tens.

At the morning session much time was
consumed in the hearing of arguments as
to whether or not the following clause
should be Inserted In the by-laws:
Party politics shall positively not be allowed
to be discussed In the conventions of this body.
ThiF. however, shall net be so construed as to

Walter Macarthnr made strenuous ef
forts to prevent this clause being stricken
out and he eventually won his point.

amid great applause: ,

place of meeting after a spirited contest,
in which San Jose was a competitor.
It was. decided to pay the president of
the State Federation (.f Labor a salary of

A resolution was adopted requesting
that the Legislature frame laws under

TION OF LABOR YESTERDAY AT THE CIX5SIXG SESSION.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Commitee
decided yesterday to recommend Braun
hart's ordinance providing- for a two-and
a-half-cent warfare for pupils of public
and private schools. An amendment was
inserted in the ordinance making its pro
visions applicable only to pupils under
the age of eighteen years. The represen
tatives of the various itreet railroad com
panies, however, will be given a hearing
on the merits of the ordinance at a meet
ing to be held next Wednesday afternoon.
Chairman Braunhart slated that the flna!
action of the committee would depend on
any counter proposition that would bo
made by the street railway companies,
granting a reduction for pupils.
Attorney J. E. Fouids. representing the
Market Street Railway Company, said
ihat the committee should lirst determine
the jurisdiction of the board to pass such
an ordinance and after that its validity
if it should be adopted. Fouids said that
thp proposed ordinance was almost iden
tical with the Ma.-&achusetts statute,
which is now being '.-onsidereti by Lli.j
United States Supreme Court. He read a
decision from the Circuit Court, which
held the statute invalid and repugnant lo
the fourteenth constitutional amendment.
He mentioned another ooint at issue, in
volving the jurisdiction of the Board of
Supervisors in the suit brought by the
State Board of Railroad Commissioners
asainst the Market Street Railway Com
pany now before the California Supreme
Court to determine the right of tne com
missioners to fix fares for street railway,
companies.
Braunhart quoted a provision of the
charter which says that the i^oard of Su
pervisors .has power to lix, establish and
reduce the fares and chareres for trans
porting- passengers and goods thereon.
Comte suggested Miat the Market
Street Company make some counter prop

Of course no family would rent a
' piano if they thought that they
, could afford to buy one. It Is only
natural to prefer ownership to
; routing.
If a family can afford to rent a
piano they can afford to own one
, by means of the new rent contract
! plan of Sherman. Clay & Co.
m This plan is different from the us-
ual Installment plan. The pay-
ments are $6.00 a month, which ro
; toward the payment of the piano.
] Why, there are many homes right
I hero In San Francisco which are
1 paying $4.00, $5.00 and $6.00 a month
! merely rentlngr a piano.
Own your pianoâ investigate Sher-
! man. Clay & Co.'s new plan. Threa
