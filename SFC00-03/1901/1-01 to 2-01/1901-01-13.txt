desert3 the room. But first they toss a
small coin into a corner to pay the grave
diggers, whom they know will come as
soon as they hear of the death. Later on
a couple of ghouls, disguised with masks
and well muffled, gather up the coin. No
body knows their identity and nobody

pears In the village or a stranger sus
pected of beinc a deputy, he is met with
doors slammed in hi3 face, malevolent
eyes peering from crack3 and stolid defi
ance. This hatred of deputies had led to
Tnany unpleasant predicaments on' the
part of chance visitors to the settlement.
For instance, a short, time ago John S.
Mnyhright, a San Rafael barber, was
bratm, bound and imprisoned by a pang
of these yellow thugs. Why they did It
he nevrr learned, nor did the Investigat
ing officers of the law; but all the evi
dence goes circumstantially to show that
they mistook him for a Deputy Fish Com
missioner.
A great deal of money is made by these
fishermen by illicitly stretching fine-mesh
eeines in the bay, catching small fish and
drying them for shipment to China.
It is this pernicious line of industry that
is rapidly thinning out the table 'fish In
tÂ£e bay; that is why- the Deputy Fish

Their particular white enemy and the
men they hate most In all the world are
the Deputy Fish Commissioners, for the
latter have an insistent way of overhaul
ing their junks in search of email fish and
seines made of mesh under the legal size.
Two such stories have come out within
as many months: Marooning: a white man
to a pott or/a little island in the bay near
the village and the imprisonment of a
elranger eurpected of being a prying
deputy sheriff. Very recently, too, the
Coroner dug up eIx bodies on the scrub
covered hill just above the camp.
But periodically these evildoers commit
w'ld pranks of lawlessness apparently
through sheer deviltry and just to show
they are not living under ihe white man's
statutes. Then the daily pajwrs exploit
them and the world at larse gets an idea
what they are doing in their sun-baked
village.

A CHINESE
PIRATE
COLONYIN
SAN FRANCISCO. .The question "What would Jesus do?"
'.has been much canvassed in recent years.
If '.' that question could be so answered
that the "answer would fit all the mani
fold and varying conditions and details
of our lives to-day the question, "What
lÂ»* a Christian?", would not need to bo
discussed, for the answer to it would
be amply illustrated in tens of thousand*
of actual human lives. But under exist
. ing conditions the consideration of such
a question is attended by bewildering con
fusion .and mental conflict.' One takes
Paul's text, "If ye have not the epl/it
of Christ ye are none of his," and inter
prets it in the intense white llsht of
the Chrlfitlifo and the Sermon .on tha
. Mount. . To be a Christian, he says, Is
nothing less than to live up to this Ideal
always, and in all life'*} details. The re
sult or reaction Is apt to be a demoraliz
ing sort of discouragement. .The ideal I*
felt to be so high as to be unattainable
and is soon abandoned or not attempted
Bt all. Another takes such texts a.i "The
blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from
all sin" and translates them into a myt
â¢â¢Â¦.-â¢ . -
* means something more and better to be
a Christian now than It meant to be a
Christian even in the apostolic days.
THK answer to this question must de
pend In l.-ree measure upon the
ii pens? in which we use the term
â¢â¢Christian." A young fellow of 23.
more *"freshâ¢ than wise, with a veneer of
education all too thin to conceal the
Etrnotura cf conceit upon which It has
been i.tid. once shocked a venerable high,
church parson of the old school by Im
moderate indulgence la gibes at re
ligion and religious people. "Young
xnsn." paid the divine, . with se
vrr'.ty, "only the unregenerate could
talk fo profanely." "But pardon
me. doctor," retorted the youth; "did
you net yourself, nearly twenty-three
years ago. make a Christian of me
by sprinkling me with water and uttering
re'lpiou? words over m?? Have vou for
frotten that? In any case, what oecomes
of your favorite theory about baptism?""
If in this Ftory hot-headed, irreverent
youth pained a Fcemlng momentary ad
vantape over age and sacerdotal wisdom,
the fact must rÂ»e debited to the supersti
tious and antiQUSted dogma of baptismal
repeneratkm. At another angle on the
plane of historic Christian doctrine ap
pears the ftory of the great founder of
Methodism and a convert of his who had
tumbled from grace. John Wesley halt
ed by the wayside to assist the prostrate
man. The poor wretch recognized his
cood Samaritan friend, and. lookinc ud
with a drunken leer into Wesley's â¢ be
r.:pn face, exclaimed: "Mr. Wesley!
Good mf:r,! 'Twas you made me a Chris
tian!" "I quite believe it."' replied the
great Methodist; "this looks like eome of
my bundling work."
It !* the ircny of both these incidents
which gives them their grim sisr.iflcs.ncp.
Similar ia the Irony of history on Con-
Ftantine's edict proclaiming the Roman
empire a "Christian nation." Salvation
by ritual, fcy hysteric, emotion and by
Rational proclamation F till have their
tdvoca*c5, as wf>'i ;is salvation by hered
ity end by personal conviction, for hu
tvzzi nature is a thing of many diversities.
The present question, however, is not
what Is the host proccee of making Chris
t:a^F. but what is the- best kind of prod
uct, actual and ideal, hearing this name.
Some Investigation, analysis and com
parison of the various nostrums in that
ro:rt!c pharmacopeia which concerns
it?c!f vrlth the "cure of souls" might be
lcterestir.gr upon occasion, but the ques
tion. What is a Christian? precedes that
mattrr in logical or<Icr.
It is .r.ot a sufficient answer to such a
question to nay that a Christian Is a
believer in or a follower of the historic
personage named Jesus Christ, for such
*n answer would be- too vague. On the
other hand, it would probably be Impos
tlKe to frame a brief and intelligible
answer that should take the form of a
precise definition. It is recorded that
the disciples of Jesus Christ were first
called Christians at Antioch, a famed
city of Syria, more than eighteen cen
turies ago. The ruc'.o was given them m
derision, probably, at first, but It lived
End v.'as accepted in the world as a con
venient designation cf a class of persons
distinguished from the rest of mankind
by ideas, qualities of character and habits
of life which were due to the influence of
the life and teachings of Jesus Christ,
upon the thought ar.ii life of the world.
We do not know much In detail of the
personal lives and habits of those Aii
tioch Christians. Forcibly they were no
better than the majority of Christians
row living; possibly many present-day
Christians are better than they were.
However that may be, we have at least
as good opportunities as they had for as
certaining what true Christianity io.
ivhiie In some respects we have an lra-
that study the sense in which we accept
the miraculous element in those records
is practically of little moment. The main
matter I9 the acceptance of the general
teachings, character and personality of
Christ there presented asi exhibiting the
ideal of, human character and as illus
trating the spiritual possibilities of human
life. Even if such acceptance ia merely
passive, it may be fruitless; the trua
Christian Is the man whose spiritual na
ture Is fired by his contemplation of
Christ, so that Christ's word is his law
*nd Christ's spirit becomes the force that
governs the trend and conduct of his life
in all matters and relationships. Tha
Christ-spirit in a human life Is the essen
tial matter. That spirit, however, has
many diversities of operation and expres
sion. Just as vegetable life produces
peaches upon ene tree and apples upon
another, or pansies upon one plant and,
roses upon another. A number of men
need not think or act exactly alike be
cause they are all Christians. They may
differ, as did Peter and John.' or Paul and
James; but all must be animated by this
one spirit, as were those disciples. Meek
ness of temper, gentleness of spirit, con
sideration for others, fidelity to duty, res- .
olute resistance of evil, tireles activity
and unflinching self-sacrifice in the ser
vice of mankindâ these were the forms of
love to Ood and man 'which shone forth,
through every recorded word and deed of
Jesua Christ. These, therefore. are> tha
marks of a Christian to-day, and tha
measure of his Christianity is the meas
ure of the spirit in him which devises and
produces this kind, of conduct in actual
life. .
It should go without saying that a
Christian Is essentially a religious man,
but there is apparent need for emphasiz
ing thlj point at this time in San Fran
cisco. "Every man his own God" may
be a taking theme ot popular Sunday
tvenlnjr discourses Â¦ at Metropolitan
Temple Just now, but viewed from the
Christian standpoint this doctrine is &
very empty bubble. The late Dr.-Slar
tineau, who probably has had no peer in
this century as a profound thinker upon
ethical and religious subjects, once said:
"I do not myself believe in the efficacy of
purely ethical communions; short of the â¢
enthusiasm of personal affection between
the spirit of man and the spirit of God tha
blending of religion ia not reached. And
no permanent cohesion can be expected
on the moro ethical ground of relations
between man and men." Such a state
ment from such a master in the domain
of ethics and religion is deserving of tha
moat â¢ profound attention. To attempt to
reduce Christianity to the level of a
echool of ethics is to rob the body of It3
soul or to take the sun out of the sky
and leave there nothing but the cold and
changeful light of a lifeless moon. Ia
short, it Is all moonshine.
The life of Jesus Christ was pervaded
by the vivid and abiding consciousness
of spiritual relationship with a personal
God. whom he taught his followers to
think of and to love and worship as a
father. Not only so. but the entire record
of his life testifies that that conscious
ness was the secret of his marvelous
character and power. It follows, there
fore, that to be a true Christian is to be
animated by that God-consclousnesa
which Is the spirit of all lofty aspiration,
and true worship and which alone can
subordinate animal passion to spiritual
purpose and thrill tho soul -with the en
thusiasm of humanity. This la the es
sence of Christianity, and any human be
injr is truly eminent or Insignificant as a
Christian in proportion to his possession
of this central quality of spiritual being,
this actuating motive of Christian service.

A" Christian Is an undergraduate in tnÂ»

there Is so much to learn, always aspirins
becau?* his Ideals are so lofty, but always
remembering, that the alternating s^ps
of ceaseless progress toward the msner

the most frequently recorded saying in
all the writings of the Apostle Paul. onÂ»
of the most illustrious pupils of tha
School of Christ, and one whose record
is unique for Inspired and tireless activity.
To adopt this general idea of a Chris
tian is to exclude from Chrstianity largo
classes cf people who call themselves
Christians, as for example, those who
wenr the cloak of religion influenced by
motives of material gain or social ap
proval, and all those whose religion is
a mere endeavor to shun hell and gain,
heaven hereafter, each one for himseif
alone. All these are slaves of the deadly
sin of selfishness, and therefore have no
part or lot with Christ. Whether they
are members of churches makes no
dtrterer.ee. The supreme good that a
church tan do for any man is to heip
him out of hit Â«elflsh self Into tho Christ
spirit and then to help him In the pro
gressive development and expression cf
the Christllfe. But a Christless churc^
member Is un abortion which no church
cÂ»n xave trom eternal damnation.
In order to be a Christianâ whether with
or without the aid. of the churchâ a man
must fomehow com* Into spiritual con
tact with Christ, and that contact must
kindle In him the divine nre which alone
can make a permanent Ideal of tho char
acter of Jesus Christ. The main aid to bÂ»j
relied upon In this matter is a personal
study of the records contained In the first
four books of tho New Testament. In

cultivation of character by spiritual de
velopment in obedience to the teachings
of Christ and by sympathetic study of
the spirit and example of his life. In
the view of this person, or clas3 of per
sons, to be a Christian is to believe with
all the blind trust of superstition in cer
tain doctrines (which it were foolish if
not wrong, tatry to understand) as to the
mystical effects of Christ's death upon
thÂ» mutual relationships of God and man.
"Only believe!" is one of . the favorite
watchwords of this school of theology,
nr.d the faith to which it rerers does not
always (and indeed is not required to)
translate itself to the intelligence of its

is the iaw of toe dancing.
Exercises of tho lÂ«gs and body follow.
The strengthening ct muscles in legs and
feet Is our chief aim, because toe dancing
requires much strength in these as well
as skill. This is why a child who has
been in the habit of v.aiking, running,
dancing, jumping, is a more apt pupil in
most cases; part of the teacher's work Is
already done if tha legs and feet are
strong. ;r;^;V v'Vi>^
Xot only Is strength being added unto
the pupil during all this work, but supple
ness as well. Unless she does plenty of
practicing at home the lessons must pro
gress slowly. Theory is aW that. a teacher
can impart.
The ironclad rule of toe dancing is,
"keep the knees straight." ' With thla
rule in mind all sorts of exercises; must
be gone through; exercises that seem im
possible at first. . â¢
"Lay your leg on the table," I say.
"That's nothing," each youngster may
respond boastfully.
She doubles the leg, wriggles her body
and stretches, hanging to ( her balance by
Its dizzy edge until she gets- the leg upon
the table -and eyes me triumphantly.
"But you bent the knee,"I correct.
"Oh. yes, that's so. . I'll do it without
bending."
She tries to do It again as I show her;
kneo straight, leg turning upon the hip
as a pivot. She iinds that it can't be
dene the first time cf trying, nor yet the
next. Probably she does not succeed at
all during that day except as I lift the
leg for her or let her by leaning
upon me. ; L ';";'.
She must keep on trying after the les
son is over. She may use some .surface
lower than a table at , firstâ a low* cha:r
or sofa. ; Gradually she can raise the It/
higher, and after the result Is once gained
it cannot be lost. , '
After the muscles 'are prepared and the
knees taught, to"- bo stiff, then ' the r filial
training upon the toes begins. This is a
long, slow process In mogtcases. Try. to
stand upon your tiptoes' for a second and
you wiH'reallze this. Children are taught
to walk about ; the schoolroom "on *Â¦ their

A LESSON IN TOE DANCING.
?T is said that Alma ence started
j| out to bÂ» the kind of little girl
[Â» that says "Now-I-lay-rac" at S
every evening:. When the f?d for in
fant dancers carae along 1 it was found
more profitable to defer her '*Now-I
lay-me" until 12 o'clock.
In tbÂ« school Â¦which she attended
the was net educated, but her to:s
were. She had to go along with them.
She watched them learning to stand
alcse and to walls and to polka, and
ct lest when they were able to spin
like a heads-or-tails dollar they were
graduated.
Soon after Alma and her toes were
put on at a local theater. They suc
ceeded so well that in time they be
came knoTn as iust too cute.
One day a little neighbor said to
Alnia:
"My mamma says she wouldn't let
me b? an infant wonder.''
"Did you ever think of beingone?'*
asked Alzna. significantly, who, al
though only 9. knew a thing or two.
"No." replied th3 little neighbor,
"because my mamma says that the
glittering life of the stage is death
to a child. It is flame to the moth.'-'
"And my mamma says,*' put in an
other little neighbor, "that the child
of the stage leads the life cf a dog,
being cruelly beaten for every fail
ure."
"Come with me fcr a day and see/'
responded Alrna.
The little neighbors did so and this
is what they saw.
When Alma got up in the morning
she had an uninteresting breakfast
of poached eggs and somebody's pat
ented oats. Then shs had to run down
to the grocery, and later she had to
have a ragtime coat tried on, and then
it was time for lunch.
In tho afternoon sh* could play for
a while. Aftsrward she must try q,i
the coat again and practice some new
step and learn a new song. After din
ner she went to the theater.
The little neighbors followed her
to a barnlike place, which she said
was the stage, but they did not un-
derstand 3iov7 that could be. Ther9
were boards and old furniture stand
ing about and there was no giittcrlrg.
Alma was slipped through a cracit
betwcm boards and they could sec
her dancing bsyoncl tho crack. Sh-3
returned a few times to be popped
into different costumes and after a
quarter of an hour of this she said
she was through.
She v/as not borne ofc to a cham
pagne supper, nor was she beaten
with a duznbball. She merely wen:
home and ate bread and milk.

HOW TO TEACH TOE DANCINGft AMES LANE ALLEN has grown
rt Jl to be considered ens of our lead
â ing American novelists â and
quite justly is he entitled to that dis
tinction. His work possesses a life
and fire, and yet a delicate refine
ment, that places it at ones among
the best in the litcrelura of to-day.
For seme time Mr. Allen was a suc
cessful magazine writsr in NswYork,
contributing meritorious essays and
short stories to Harpar's Magazine
and The Century, but it was not until
the appearance of that charming tai9
of old Kentucky life â "The Choir In
visible" â that his name ro3o above
those of his contemporaries.
Mr. Allen comes from good old Vir
ginian and Kentucky stock on the pa
ternal side, while his mother was a
Miss Helen Foster of Mississippi.
His birthplace was on a farm in 3Tny
ctte County, about ssvjn milt3 from*
XÂ«zington, Ky., and it was here that
he spent his early childhood and de
veloped a love for that courftry which
h^ has s:nc3 made famous through his
books.
He was educated in his native
State and'in 1872 graduated from tha
Kentucky (Transylvania) TJnivjrsity.
He began his way in the world by
teaching school, first in the district
schools at horac and later in Missouri.
He gave this up to accept a position
as a private tutor and th*n finally

jectively suspecting the fact.
The pnsslon of -Selwyn for Marjnrle
Wentworth produces In his mlr.rl such an
antagonism to the thought of another's
possessing her affections that he converts
Henry Winchester's love Into merely a
regard for the heroine. Qfcackenbos be
lieves that the hypnotist can make and
unmake love.
When Selwyn discovers what ho has
done he dehypnotlzcs Henry Winchester
and the novel ends happily.
It Is a pity the Idea could not. havo

Tales of the ex-Tanks.
Clarence Louis Cullcn calls his volume
of tales "A Hook of Hard-1-.uck Stories,"
and he further adds the remark, on ' the
title page that "you can't keep a squirrel
on the ground." So much Is all the key. to
be found before one comes to the intro
ductory note.
If you have been speculating as to the
kind of tanks referred to by Mr. Cullen,
his cftrly referenco to the Harlem^ Club
of Former Alcoholic Degenerates enlight
ens you. The long and short of the mat
ter Is that the book Is a budget of twentyf
five stories concerning heroes who have
emerged from the .golden haze of tank

natural that comparisons with the other
should be constantly forcing themselves

efforts of Mr. Field collaborating with

sorely lacking in just this point. Only

we must look upon it rather as a pleas
ent b^ok of stories collected from the
writings of Berkeley college folk and rest
xtith the hope that later some student of
the University of California may see fit
to pive us a volume devoted entirely to
college life. The editors of the present
work feel this point and explain it by
raying: "We have not chosen stories
dealing exclusively with college life, as
In so doing Â»c found we must lower the
Ftandard of the book as a whole, but the
efbff has selected stories which were
Â¦written while their authors were college
Ftudents, with reference solely to their
literary merit."
The object of publication is a very laud-
Bfclf one snd nsirje from the worth of the
bo^k Itself the editors are deserving of
every hf'.p from the public In return for
their efforts in such a good cause. We
quote from the preface of the volume:
â¢"The principal reason that these stories
have been gathered together and given to
the public is to start the fund wherewith
to erect a fountain on the campus of tho
University Df California to be in harmony
with the great Hearsi architectural plar..
This fountain is to be dedicated by a
grateful student body and alumni tu
Mrs. rbebo Hearst, in tok^n of their
hifih c-st'-em for her and in recognition of
all that her benevolence and personal in
terest has done for them."
The thrr-* stories devoted to matters
purely r-ollfgiate and therefore most appro
priate for first mention are: "Travis Hal

MINNIE MADDEP.N FISKE is

She Is to bring us "Tess of the

Sharp," and give us a chance to think
wjiat we please about them. This is more
than most of the big Eastern stars are
willing to do with their pet pieces, so we
are likely to show a vigorous gratitude.
Mrs Fiske has always been the most
stubborn of dramatic people; hence it is
that she comes unheralded by syndicate
trumpets. She has kept persistently on
In her own way and her talents belong
to nobody but herself. It took her a good
many years to convince New York that
she was an actress, as she bore no letter
of introduction to its favor signed by big
managerial names; but she convinced at
last.
The way she did It Is an instance of her
own stubbornness. She decided to play
Tess and 'people laughed in her face at
the idea. She. the wiry, intellectual
woman whose brain overbalanced: tho

The role demands Intensity of emotion
and tragic depth. It is the tragedy of a
woman cast off by her husband when he
learns her sorry secret. The final under

close by Tess' unhappy death. Those who
have read the book remember her seeking
of refuge in the ancient ruin St.0neb.en3e.
This scene closes the play.

The December number of the Political

treats in a comprehensive manner several
questions bearing 1 on the present political

article Edward Van Dyke Robinson
makes an exhaustive study of "War and
Economics," a subject of unusuaf inter
est, forcibly presented. The writer reviews
the great wars of history and discusses
each in its cause and effect relative to
existing economic conditions. "War to
day is not a conflict of arms, but of civ

since both spring from the same source â
the law of diminishing returns. "With in

The following is taken from an interest
ing article on "Sir John Tenniel's Fifty
Years on Punch," in the American Month
ly Review of Keviews for January:
"He was educated at a private school
and early developed a. taste for drawing
and painting, lie never studied art, how
ever, in any regular way,' but was self
taught, like most of our American car
toonists. While in the twenties he painted
some creditable pictures In oil, but hia
taste for Illustrating and for line work
drawing developed very early, and al
though he has long been a member of tha
Royal Institute ' of Painters in Water
Colors his real life-work Js to be found In
the files of Punch. At one time he drew
charming Illustrations for books and
Bhowed a decided aptitude for fairy pict
ures. He was the original Illustrator, for
Instance, of 'Alice la "Wonderland* and
Its eequel.
"Ho joined the staff of Punch to take
the place of Doyle, who was leaving tho

"His political grasp Is wide and vigor

been enriched by his familiarity wltn lit

Thus he has been enabled, on occasions

a manner exceedingly apt and felicitous.
"Since the invention of photo-mechani

The novel tells of the meeting of two
subliminal selfs In the theater. The
actress Is unconscious of tho Influence at
work upon her, and the suggcstlonist is
not conscious of exerting this power. He
becomes so interested in the play that
he unconsciously inspires the, heroine,
who makes genuine life out of her acting.
Miss Wentworth rises at once to the sum
mit of fame. Objectively the two do not
know each other, but * their subliminal
pelfs recognize each- other, and Marjorie
Wentworth searches for her inspircr.
Quackenbos thinks that the unintentional
hypnotism is very possible, and goes on
to say that much of the love that has a
spiritual side Is kindled in this way, and
that it is a common thing for a strong
subliminal attachment to spring up be-
hypnotic influence. He says the Incidents
of the story are in perfect harmony with
possibilities of hypnotic suggestion. The
soothing into a refreshing sleep of a. man
which causes a successful crisis in an
acute dlpease, the inspiration of an ac
tress by a man of strong personality, the
estrangement of the lovers caused by
Selwyn, who had unintentionally deflected

pendicular of loyal attachment are all
possible to the hypnotist.

A Master of Life.
So Richard carries off the girl. Intending
to marry her; but as ail the world known,
he was devoted more to war than to love,
and went on a crusade to the Holy Land
and married Queen Berengarla. For the
development of the romance and^ the story
of how the love of Richard and Jehane
fared, the reader muitt consult the book
itself. (Published by the Macmlllian Com
pany, New York. Price Jl.>
Jehane sends Richard away, paying:
"Ye?. Richard; yes, ray king; the king
must have the king's sister and Jehane
go back to the byre. Eagles do not mate
with buzzards." Then to escape Richard's
lov* she agrees to please her brother
and ir.arry a certain Sleur de Gurdon. An
the etood by the altar on the wedding
day Richard came Into the church and
this is what happened: "Not the lust
of the flesh but of dominion ravened In
him. This woman, this Jehane Saint Pol,
thl3 hot-haired slip of a girl was his.
The leopard had laid his paw upon her
shoulder, the mark was still there: he
could not suffer any other beast of the
forest to touch that which he had marked
for himself. â¢ â¢ â¢ When Jehane touched
by Saint Pol on the shoulder shivered and
left staring, and stood up in turn, sway
ing a little and held out her thin hand;
when the priest had the ring on his book
and the two hands, the red and the white,
trembled to the touchâ Richard rose from
his knee and stole softly forward with
his long, soft, crouching stride. *'.*,*
So softly he trod that the priest, ofd and
blcareyed as he was, saw him first. With
Jchane's hand in his own the priest
stopped and blinked. Richard had stopped
too, tense, quivering for the spring. â¢ â¢,â¢
It was done in a flash. From his crouched
attitude he went as it seemed at one
bound.".
This is the way the heroine appeared
to a certain Abbot MIlo. who is supposed
to furnish the chronicles out of which the
narrative is compiled: "He watched her
shrewdly and hrs described her for us
with the meticulous particularity of his
time and temper. The iris of her eyes
was wet gray, but ringed with black and
thot with yellow, giving so the effect
of hot green; her mouth was of an ex
traordinary dark red color, very firm In
texture, close-grained like the darker sort
of strawberries." The Abbot says cf her:
"I knew Foon enough how her case stood;
how hope and doubt strove in her and
cheked to silence. 1 guessed how within
these reticent members swift love ran
like wine; but because of this proud,
brave mask of hers I was slow to un
derstand her worth."
"Richaid Yea' and Nay." by Maurice
Hewlett. Is a historical romance having
for hero Richard the Lion Hearted of
England, and dealing with % his love for
a certain Jehane Saint Pol. It Is a work
that has been commended by many crit
ics and therefore it Is one about which
there will be two opinions. The feature
of the story which will first strike the
reader is the style in which it is wrttten.
It is a style not readily described. It
has the short sentences in which Victor
Hugo delighted. It has the turgid mass
ing of heavy words Into which Carlyle
sometimes erred. It has archaic forms
such as might have been written in the
days when Richard was alive and English
had not yet become a language.
Of PJchard we are told lie was half
dog. half cat; a human leopard. The
description goes on: "Furtive he was' not,
yet seeming to crouch for ; ja spring; not
savage, yet primed for savagery: not
cru?l. yet quick on the and on
the watch for it. He was neither a rogue
nor a madman; and yet he was as cun
ning as the one and as heedless as the
Dthjr. He was arrogant, but his smile
veiled the fault; you saw it best in a.
fleepy look he had. His blemishes were
many, his weaknesses two. He trusted
his own force too much and despised
everybody else in the worl<i. Not that
he thought them knaves; he was certain
they were fools."
If you have to depend upon books, the
best one to hold your interest and impress
facts upon your mind is one by a person
who has seen with a trained eye. which
lets no detail escape, and who possesses
that rare faculty of being able to get
his thoughts on paper just as he would
talk to a friend. Such a book is Mr.
Hart's "Arfionaut Letters."
TJie fact that these letters were orally
dictated is probably one of the most im
portant reasons for their charm. In read
ins you do not feel confined to the re
striction of printed pages for your im
pressions, but rather as if you were at the
author's elbow and shared with him the
delights of his trip.
These letters first appeared in the
Argonaut of San Francisco and are fa
miliar to its readers, but they will prob
ablv now be glad to have the opportunity
of obtaining them In permanent form.
Borne sixty excellent half-tone reproduc
tions of photographs add greatly to the
text by way of illustration. The book is
well worth reading. If you cannot af
ford to buy it, borrow it from some one.

Ids Â»lfe.
Who shall fathom 'he mind of woman?
Zella had peen so much of the rough and
disagreeable side of men's lives beyond
the borders of civilization that < sho felt
curious to note what, change there might
be under the Influence, of polite society.
Moreover, she had come to like herself as
Philip Grey. If the shadow of her great
loss had not fallen upon her spirits there
is no knowing how she might have re
ceived the more than significant atten
tions of a very prettv woman at the
"Windsor, in New York, where sho had
stayed two days as Phliip Grey, while Bho
had. rooms at tho Gllsey House as Zella
Brunnen.
It was from the Gllsey House that she
had wired her Chicago friends of her de
parture for Liverpool. Nor was she an
hour too early in doing so; for the latest
telegrams' and letters t?he found awaiting
here there declared the intention of Old
GlcncoÂ« and Mr. Storey both to look her'
up. She had kept them contented with a
letter written on board the train, posted
in New Xork by the colored attendant.
in which she had stated her intention of
spending a week or so with her. relatives,
the Gruneisons, who had a place on the
Hudson.
One thins: that afflicted Zella. a good
deal was the amount;of diplomatic 'lylnt?
she had found necessary to play .her part
of Philip Grey successfully. She satisfied
It seemed to her that she had had no
real rest for years and years; yet the
time she had pallled forth from Chicago.' a
missionary of justice, could be counted by
months only. . . . She thought of
many things and realised, without quite
understanding why, that she had found
the loss of her lover less, and less hard to
bear. Occupation is the. surest, antidote
to sorrow. It is not how many years we
live that makes age, but how much wo
do In tho time.
Coming en board at the last moment,
phÂ«Â» had gone straight to her room, which
had been transferred from Zella Brunnen
to Phillip Grey. . . . She had taken
the cabin in the name of Zella. Brunnen,
with the understanding that Phillip
pnould occupy it in case Miss Brunnen
had to delay her journey until the next
sailing. It was in that way that Miss
Brunnon's name came to be inserted on
the list of passengers. ... As Phil
lip Grey, sne saw the steward and made
arrangements with him that he was never
to; disturb her under any circumstances;
that she required a great deal of rest;
would go down to meal3 or have them
brought to her. as she felt Inclined; that,
whether ehe appeared at table or desired
to be served in her room was a matter
for herself; that lie was to leave her se
verely alone, unless she rang for him;
that If these arrangements were carefully
fulfilled there would be ten dollars for him
at the end of the voyage; and that thero
were live dollars for him now, to keep his
memory fresh. "All right, sir," ho had
Bald; "I won't never disturb you." . . .
Then she unpacked her cabin luggage
and got Into her berth. She had not to
climb Into it as she had had to do at
Blind Man's Drift; and there were other
soothing 'differences, such as clean sheets,
perfumed with eau de cologne, close at
her elbow an electric lamp, and within
reach a bell to summon a good fairy in
the shape of her steward, commanding
every luxury that human ingenuity could
think of for first class passengers on an
acean steamer.
From the storm and stress of a wild ex
perience ashore to the calm of a pleasant
deck cabin on board a Cunard liner; what
a change! It seemed to Zella years since
slio had waved her I-and to dear old
Dankes and his comrades at the Red
Horse Forks, though It was less than two
weeks. . . . She hardly knew her
self, a .4 she lay. pillowed, watching the
sea through the port holes, between the
passing of passengers and sailors going
to and fro, and listening to the steady
beat of tbe distant screw.
STRANGE MEETING
ON BOARD AN ATLANTIC LINER; A
CHAPTER XXXIX.
Three days later, with a mule. team spe
cially fitted out ar.d with, as attendant
pquirr-s Dankes. Dave. Captain Dan and
Pete Kerridere (as representing the three
camps). Philip Grey arrived at the Red
Horse Forks, where the guard and driver
of the stage for Carson city had never
In all hi? experience seen such a friendly
and at the same time regretful send-off
as the Platts Valley men gave to his
young and handsome passenger.
"Which I remember put tin' you down
here, not more'n sixty days, youngster.
Hope you've etruck It rich."
"You bet!" paid Captain Dan. "No such
a lead's been struck since the glorious
days of '49 in Frisco."
"Then 1 wish you all a good time, gen
tlemen," said the- popular whip of the
famous conch; and, aroused with a se
ries of reports of the lnsh that echoed
among tho hills, the Carson team leaped
forward and soon left Dankes and" hts
companions gazing upon a cloud of dust,
in which the romantic heroine of Platts
Valley disappeared.
She placed the bills where she had told
Dave he would find them. Ana Solomon
paid neither he nor Dave was ever likely
to forget her for a minute, wherever they
might be; and as for Dave, his fortune
was made when he. being an orphan,
flung in his lot with an old bachelor, who,
in his way, was just as lonely in the
world.
"Then you have only to draw upon rrte
at Denver or Chicago, or New York, or
Lun'un. and Solomon Dankes, at the Na
tional Bank. Denver, will be good for it.
And you'll do him the honor and yourself
the justice to begin right here."
He opened his rough little desk and took
out writing implements and a book, from
which he tore two blank checks and
signed them.
"No. no." sold Zella. tearing them up;
"I would not run the risk of losing them.
Give me a few bills and a signed check
for $">000 on Denver, and I shall have all I
want."
Dankes compiled, and thereupon Zella
made up a little packet for Dave.
"1 am leaving a parting remembrance
for Dave. Some day you are going to
tr.ke him to San Franrlaco. and I want
him to think of me in the beautiful city
of the Golden Gate."
"But you require a few thousand dollars
in hand, eh? How much? Won't you
open Glover's chest?"
"I would rather not."
"There ain't nawthin' ag'en you in nay
ther character. But excuse me ef I re
fers to what my dear pard called filthy
luker. Thar's certain values of gold in
his chest.; as I've named to you more'n
wunst: what about It? What was Glo
ver's is your'n. not only in accordance
with his will but in any reckonin' with
me as his lftwful ppard."
"Thank you. dear old Generosity. I
p.m glad vou mentioned It. I have some
money lying in the bank at Denver."
"if you might desire to send me a ca
ble, please address it to Zella Brunnen,
care of Straker, Love and Lorrimer, Bed
ford row, London, England. I have writ
ten it down for you and pinned it up by
the side "of the portrait in Ned GloveFs
room. Let It always be called Ned (plo
ver's room."
"That goes. And It's kinder sweet of
you to leave the plcter."
"I hope it won't stand as a rebuke to
Philip Grey?"
"I might want you, supposing this af
fair of DlggVs leaked out before it should
be convenient to my plans."
"It won't leak out." said Dankes. "But
ef it did, or of It didn't Solomon Dankes
is your pard and friend to the death, as
they says in the histories."
"You don't mean to pfiy you would come
all the way to London If I happened to
think I wanted your assistance about
anything?"
"I'd be on hand as fast as things would
carry me," said Dankes.
"Not that I put It down as 'a foregone
conclusion,' as Ned Glover, would have
said; but, sence it agrees with your own
idea, havin' slept on it. why, let it go, and
God speed!"
"So be it!" said Zella, with spirit and
decision, v .
"And ef you want me in Europe a cable
would fetch me,V he added.
be wlllin' to build a proper hotel, and his
wife and gals would come along. And
ther' ain't no reason as we shouldn't com
bine the hull of the camps In one, and
call it Brunnentown."
"You dear qld romancer," said Zella.
"Whatever you do while I am away goes.
Extend the cabin, by all means; but don't
touch Mr. Glover's room. â¢It-.was Ned's
wish that I should see Kurope. It- is the
wish of his dearest friend. Mr. Richard
Lorrimer. that I should meet him. As
Ned's lawyer, it is also necessary that
I should consult him: and since I have
put my hand to the plough as Philip
Grey, I will walk in the same, as you
advise." ' v-"
There was a titter, almost a laugh, at
Captain Dan's apology. It was, however,
Immediately suppressed.
Chicago I was one of the favorite mem
bers of the Women's Athletic Club. I
was going home one night and I was in
tuited by Abner Digges. Fresh from my
j'.thletic exercises. 1 hit him in the face,
as I have done since In your presence
with the gloves."
"And served him right, sahâ beg par
don. m!ss'." B&ld Captain Dan.
"Ned Glover was at hand, but I did
not need his assistance. He and Ned
Glover met. Digges threatened to kill
him. I was engaged to be married to
Glover. When the news of his death
came to Chicago, I was heart-broken.
Finding that no one would move in the
interests of justice, that he had been
Plain in a duel that was deemed fair in
a community that made Its own laws, I
recalled the threats of Digges, and I
gathered from such information as came
to hard that Dlgges had as good as mur
dered him."
"Yo' had a right to think so; but it was
n pquah deal, eo far as anything could
he equah with Digges," said Captain
Dan.
"That's po," wÂ«s the general response;
"so far as anythin' could be squar' wilh
Dipges."
"So, then, gentlemen. I resolved to take
the business in hand myself. It was borne
In upon me that my very training fitted
me for the adventure. I remembered the
t-tory cf David and Goliath, and I set out,
a& a man, to do a man's work."
"And by thunder, you done it!" was
the quick reply of the escort, with the ap
proval of Captain Dan, Dave standing by,
a keen but silent witness, Jim crouching
nt his feet, awed by so remarkable an
assembly on the stoop of the cabin, and
Solomon Dankes very notable by his ab
sence.
"And if I have offended any of you,
by taking upon myself to pretend I was
a man among vou. I ask your pardon;
and at the same time I thank you from
my- heart for your great kindness."
"We are proud, sah â J mean, miss â to
have entertained an angel unawahs.
Boys, we will now say 'Good evening,' and
It wiil be our pleashah to call again to
morrow, and place ourselves at Mister
PhMip Grey"s service."
"That's so'." they said; and "Good even
ing. Mister Grey.'*
"One more word." said Zella, "Let what

of the camp."
"As you say, bo shall it be."
Then they trooped away, down the trail,
in the last glories of the sunset. Zella
watched them depart, leaning against
the lintel of the doorway.
"I've made some coffee," said Dave,
touching her arm; "and ther's some meat
and a jar of honey."
Jim ran in 'and out of the cabin, and
then dashed down the trail to greet Solo
mca Dankes, who came lumbering
through the fading light, a veritable pic
ture of a lusty old age.
"Dear friend," said Zella, "do you for
give me?"
"I guess your success Justifies the
means." said Dankes. "Gimme your
hand."
He raised it to his lips; at which Zella
blushed.
"Nay, dear pard; let me still be Philip
Grey. "
"You are not the less my pard. I hope.
p.s my dear Ned's affianced, and won't
have "less respect at my hands."
"Come in, then," she said, "while I
wash."
Dankes was smoking when she entered
the general room
Solomon went Into the cabin and shut
the door. Zella. taking towels from a box
r-ereath the bench, and injuring out a
bowl of water from a large wooden jug,
proceeded to make her toilet. She fin
ished the operation In her own room,
doubting for a moment whether she
Fhculd unlock her large box and don her
petticoats. She decided to maintain her
chiracter as Philip Grey: and consult
â¢with Dankes as to her movements on tho
"Won't you eat?" paid Zella.
"I guess not," said Dankes. "I won't re
fuse a cup of coffee."
"Dave seemed to think I must both eat
an<~" drink," Bald Zella.
"Hut you ain't eatln' much?"
"I am not 1-ungry
"You done a great thing. You have lift
ed a weight from the heart of this people.
You have, as you told them, been an in
strument of vengeance."
Dankes smoked nnd talked In th's vein
to himself and to Zella until she pushed
the table aside and moved her chair near
him by tha Â«=tove. Though the night was
waim. the lighted etove continued to ba
a genlil companion.
"You're a woman In a million." slid
Dankes, "likÂ» one of them In the Bible "
"No. no. d<ar friend; much below that
ttpr.drsrd. Let me tell- vou something of
mypflf before tbe Â«J-Â»y when you held out
your k'.ndly hand to me."
She related to him in Dimple language
the story of her childhood up to the time
of her meeting with Ned Glover, on the
iin^f- of her few remarks to Captain Dan
tnr! the rest.
The old man listened with prave atten
tion, remarking at the close of her narra
tive. "You are a wonder!"
"Now, I want to ask you what I shall
do. What I Intend to do. In the first place,
is to leave here fcr Europe right away.
Itut the question is. how Kha'l'I go? As
Phi'.ip Gr^y or as Zella Brunnen?"
"Ef you go as Zella Brunnen there may
be trouhle In store; and ef you go as
Philip Grey there may be trouble, like
wise. Sence you've got used ter belli*
Mister Grey, and have come through so
much, rf I felt more independent in that
way. I should continue to walk In the
game, as long as it suited my conven
ience."
DankÂ«*s spoke with a judicial manner
that was quite impressive.
"You think so? You pee, dear friend I
feel entirely like another person as Philip
Grey, almost forgot I was to be Ned's
wifo; it takes the edge off my grief,
an<i "
"You feels that your flgh.t with Dlgges
Is Rummat that mote best ha become you
op a young man?"
"You are verv wise, Mr. Dankes." paid
Zella; "I think I will sleep on It, as they
Eay."
She did fleep on it. and the next morn-
Ing, having tried on her petticoats, she
packed them tip again, and appeared at
breakfast as Philip Grey, a shade or two
paW than usual, and by 8 o'clock a depu
tation waited upon her and Dankes, to
know their pleasure.
Her pler.sun\ then. It was, that a mule
train should be ready for her early the
next day to hurry on" to the Forks and
catch the coach to Carson City. It was
Mr. Grey's Intention to Fall for Europe
with all speed, and, above all tnlngs, his
â¢wish that they ehould guard the secret of
her visit nnd her work among them, un
til puch time as Mr. Grey should cable
thorn from Ixmdon or elsewhere, her per
mission for. its tevelation. Zella added to
Dankes' explanation of her views these
memorable words.
"Tight!" said the purser, standing In
the doorway. "Says he Â¦ feels sure he
knows you, though he enn't. recall any
one of. the name of Phillip Grey." â¢
"Indeed." said Zella. "May I offer you
a cigarette?" Â¦ .
"Thank you, no; I'm going into the
pmoke-room. The: millionaire Is to sit in
at a mild game of poker with a few pals;
he gave them* a game In his stateroom
last night, but? he says he prefers the
smoking-room. He couldn't get a deck
cabin; wanted the captain's, but he left it
to the last minute; only made up his mind
to cross a couple of. hours. before sailing.
Uncle Tom says, and he don't know what
he's going to Kurope for. Sam evidently
thinks 1 he s a bit mad; and everybody else
knows he is." )
"How cad !" said Zella.
-Â¦"The: misery of the rich Is the conso
lation of . the poor." said the purser. "So
the 1 doctor says, and he oiJght to know;
he's as poor, as they make 'em."
Zella closed Â¦ her door, drew the blinds
over the. portholes, 'flung herself upon her
couch, and ' presently :fell asleep and
dreamtthat Dexter had drowned himself.
At dusk: she .wrapped herself up In her
ulster, and went; on deck. Pacing to and
fro. inan aimless way on board ship
some to get: up an appetite.; some by. way
of a constitutional; some out of' simple
restlessness," sho met -Dexter several
times. Twice, in. the .lamplight/ she
; caught ; sight â¢ of Â¦ his face. - ; puckered and
anxious: twice he saw -hers plainly, and
stood still to look at her. She thought it
"Used to be." paid the purser. "Fool
enough to fall in love with a typewriting
girl; thought he could buy her; accus
tomed to Duy everything ho wanted; as
he couldn't buy her, he took to drink and
other women, and has been going to the
bad ever Fince," said the purser.
"You don't say!" eald Zella. "Who has
been telling you the old gentleman's
secrets."
' "Uncle Tom." said the purser, lat:ghing.
"Calls himself Sam; but if ever there was
an 'Uncle Tom' out of Mrs. Stowe's book
there he Is; and if you want to know all
about 'Mnssa' * "Irani Dexter,' why, 'gol
ley,' Uncle Tom will oblige."
Dexter, seemed to be inviting all his
neighbors to drink with) him. Sam and
the stewards were pa?sfng the wine up
and down the table, the millionaire rais
ing his glass with a benevolent greeting
all around. Presently he spoke to Sam,
aside, and Sam went over to the purser's
table, bottle In hand, with "Miissa Dex
ter's compliments, and won't the gentle
men and ladles do him the honnoh to take
wino wid him?"
The ladies mostly declined. The purser
and several of the men accepted the In
vitation. Zella declined. She was not
drinking wine to-day. Sam emptied the
bottle and fetched another, and with it
"Massa's compliments to the young
gen'leman. an' hopes he'll give him the
pleas'ah?" ' .
"Thank your master," said ,Â£ella, "and
I must postpone the pleasure until some
other day: -I am not taking wine."
- Sam, with a puzzled expression in his
eyes, poured out a glass of wine for
Zella, all the same, as If he had not heard
what pho. said. He glanced at her agafn,
as he filled up other glasses, and returned
to his master.*
When dinner was over Zella went to her
room and had- coffee brought there. It
was a calm, sunny day. She sat with her
cabin door op^n I and smoked a cigarette.
Dexter, leaning on Sam's arm, passed by,
and paused for a moment, as if he were
about to speak to her. Zella looked at
him quite unconcernedly, and he went on.
4 "Poor fellow! He does not. as you say,
look as if wealth agreed with him," Zella
replied.
"I have never seen the man that It did
agree with."
"No?"
"Always pome disappointment on hand.
Worried with every movement of stocks;
or with a wife with a heart-aching desire
to get into society that don't want her;
or there are sons who behave bartly; or
a daughter who won't marry for position.
Or, if It's an Englishman, he's dying for
a title, because his good lady wants it;
an American, to get the control of a rail
way, or boss a bank, or own the fastest
trotter, or some other tin-pot thing or
another. Never contented. 1 assure you;
that's my experience; not to mention that
their digestion's out of order, they've got
dyspepsia; always tinkering with doctors.
Why, it Isn't long since a millionaire, one
of the African crew, chucked himself
overboard."
"Is that so?"
"Couldn't bear the strain. Got an idea
that he had overrun the constable;
thought when he arrived in London he'd
be bu'sted."
"Don't say?"
"On the contrary, he was one of the
richest of the African lot. But it must be
hard to carry a pile, if you let it bother
you; It would never bother me."
"Nor me," said Zella.
"But the fact la, the people who could
carry It properly and know how to spend
It to the advantage of the world in gen
eral, they never get it. Look at this poor
Dexter;- he's one of the wealthiest men in
America. â¢ â¢ â¢ Do you see how ho
keeps looking this way? Seems as if he
knew you, or wanted to â can hardly keep
his eyes off you."
"Surely," said Zella. "he's looking
toward a pretty woman nt the next tabk-?
They say he is quite a gallant among the
ladles."
"Dexter, the millionaire." said the pur
ser to Zella, "first time he's been down to
dinner. Looks awfully bad, don't he? It
ain't all beer ai:d skittles being a million
aire. I can speak from experience; I've
seen most of them, during my time. on
the Umbria."
On the third day out Zella, who, sat at
the purser's table, came within the obser
vation of Dexter for the fipet time. He
occupied a seat at the captain's table,
that had hitherto* been vacant. She was
conscious that he was watching her In a
furtive kind of way. He was drinking
champagne. Sam was standing behind his
chair. It was evident that he v/as re
garded as a persona grata by the captain
and the other j-assengers.
HIRAM DEXTER SEES GHOSTS.
CHAPTER XL
He had founi himself, by and by, the

From Dexter, the man of affairs, he had
sunk into Dexter, the profligate. After a
youth of work and enterprise/and a man

In his comparative old age. become a crea

sanity he realized all this, and It drove
him to seek relief In the friendly oblivion
that may be found in alcohol, which, in
this respect, is rather a good than an evil
thing, for what <lse better than a dream

pleasantly and recklessly mad In sympa

the or.ly antidote, indeed, for the vileness
that Dexter had permitted himself, is re
pentance and penance, confession, com
pensation, on austere life devoted to the
good of others: .but Dexter had no longer
any gift that way. Such Intellectual
force as remained to him crumbled at the
touch .of the smallest good resolution. He
assuredly had fits of remorse, but they
developed to no good purpose; thej r were
lurid lisrhts passing over a menial slough

first days at the Palmer House, bright,
alert, -optimistic an old beau. She saw
him now â thin and shriveled, his head
bent.- except when he appeared to raise
it with an effort at defiance, though It was
really the action of despair. She saw him

few seconds a traceable impression upon

peace of mind, added to his other sins,
he had upon his soul the murder of Ed
win Glover. His mental condition, low
ered by drink and sleeplessness under his
mad passion for Zella- Brunnen. had re
ceived a great shock in the announcement
of the death of Ned Glover While that
dark business had been brewing, while'he
was waiting for news from Abner Dlgges,
he had set on foot the hideous plot to de
stroy Glover's character in the eyes of
Zella, which Bridget O'Hagan had so clev
erly and courageously frustrated. The in
struments he had used in this business
had degraded him in his own estimation,
not only as a man, but as a man of re
source and ability. /
Zella slept badly that night. She lay in
bed vatchinp the Klints of moonlight on
the distant vista of s=ea that she saw oc
casionally: â¢ â¢ ? Whether It was mid
night or later she did not know; but it
was poon after the striking of bells and
th<* soothinsr "All's well!" of the watch,
that one of the portholes was gradually
eclipsed by a l'ace.ywith eyes that for a
moment seemed luminous: it was the face
of Hiram Dexter. â¢ â¢ â¢ She shrank
back Into her berth and held her breath.
â¢ â¢ â¢ It disappeared. â¢ â¢ â¢ she won

No; sho felt Mire she .had not. â¢ â¢ â¢
â¢Dexter lied penetrated her disguise and
had been reconnolterinp her cabin. â¢- â¢ â¢
She drew her Minds, turned on the electric
light in a small reading lamp and went to
sleep, and awoke no more until late in the
morning. â¢ â¢ â¢ Looking at her watch
she found it was 11 o'clock. She dressed
and rang her bell.
"Brins me some breakfast, steward."
"Yea. sir. What will you have?"
"Coffee and toast, and whatever else Is
going."
"Nice grilled Fnlmon and a dish of cut
lets, 'am and epgs. and '.*
"Salmon, thank you. and a little fruit."
"Yes. sir." said the steward. "Some nice
grapes the cnp\ain's put on the table, a
present as he've had."
Zella felt wonderfully refreshed. She
hardly remembered when she' had slept
so well. In spite of her bad dream or the
start Dexter had given her by looking into
her cabin.
The steward brought her an excellent
breakfast, and laid the cloth with even
more care than usual; had more time, sho
supposed.
"Rather a hawful thing: 'anpened last
night;" he said, as he was leaving tho
room.
"Indeed?" said Zella. pouring out her
coffee. .
"Mr. - Dexter, the millionaire, drowned
hlsself."
"Good heavens! man: you don't say so?"
"The watch see htm kÂ». One of the men

And a millionaire, too!"
CHAPTER XLI.
"THE MYSTERIES OF LONDON."
Fortunately for Zella's peace of mind.
Dexter had carried his criminal secret to
bis death. None knew, of .the impulse he
had given to the knlfo of Abner Dlgges.
Zella bad pitied him. His self-murder
had. sorely afflicted h*i\ The thought that
she was charged with being accessory "to
his downfall troubled her not a little As
a rule, women soon, recover from the in
dlctment of having driven some lovesick
swain' to despair and even death by rea
eon of their unreciprocated passion It Is
no fault of theirs if foolish men run mad
for love. But Zella felt deep In her heart
"I'll find him far you. Air. Dexter," said
the purser; and they went into the gang
wav.
"I hove been drunk. Had 'em, Iâ dare
sp.yâ but I never was soberer than Iâ am
now. Good-night, old chap. I'm going to
turn in now. Where's â my man?"
"I have written a letterâ It's In this
pocketbook. The letter saysâ why I give
it youâ and it contains a few thousand
dollarsâand a check book, withâ the pow
erâto draw a few â more. If you won't â
have it, I'll chuck â it overboard."
"Oh! Mr. Dexter, don't do that."
"Then take It."
* "You are too kind, Mr. Dexter," safd
the purser," evidently taking the pocket
book.
"You thinkâ frâ I'veâ erâ gotâ D. T.?
Thinkâ I'mâ drunk?"
"No, Mr. Dexter; I would not be so
rude."
"You've a wife and familyâ you told mo
soâ not too well off. I'd like to makeâ you
happy. Somebody'sâ got to be made hap
py. I know whatâ you mean. They mlsht
eayâ I had given it you when I was drunk
âor you took itâ when I was dead."
â¢ "Mr. Dexter, come along, and let's have
a drink with the doctor."
Then there was a pause, as If Dexter
was thrusting something into the purser's
hand, and as if the pursuer resisted him.
"It's yonr pockethook, Mr. Dexter! I
couldn't think of it."
"When wasâ itâ taken?" asked Dexter,
slowly, as if it was difficult for him to
tpeak plainly.
'"Oh. about a week ago."
"And did â di-1â sheâ come aboard?" '
"I suppose not. The understanding was
that if she could not occupy it she would
transfer it to Philip Grey, her cousin;
which she did."
"Her cousin!" said Dexter. "Andâ was
itâ youâ thatâ erâ said Ned Glover wasâ on
bonrd?"
"Me? No! I never heard the name, to
my knowledge."
"Noâ I supposeâ not. Wonderful moon
ain't it? Do you b'lieveâ that Christ
walked on the sea?"
"Oh. yes: "why, of course. Don't you,
Mr. Dexter?"
"I don'tâ b'liove anythingâ except that I
tell youâ againâ there's ghostsâ on this
shir* "
"One of your countrymen has been tell
ing me there's rats. Some fellows call 'em
snakes, some rats, some little black dev
ils; you call 'em phosts. Mr. Dexter. If I
was" you. I'd see the doctor; he knows how
to deal with such things."
"Doctors ain't noâ pond to me. purser.
See here, you've been kindâ to meâ I want
to Kive youâ a tip."
1 hen there was a striking of matches.
"1 saw a rat along the beam in my
stateroom last night just as I was turn
ing off the light, and I was terrified to
death for fear it wasn't one."
"For fear it wasn't one I" said the Eng
lishman with a note of surprise in the
tone of his voice.
"I ehould smile! Why, you don't tell mo
you don't understand I Do you think I
wanted it to be one of those other rats?"
"Oh, I ) see," said the Englishman,
laughing.
"I guess you do,", said the other; "ain't
such a granger as that. I reckon. Not
one to blow the gas out?"
"No, not nuite such a fool as that,"
paid the Englishman.
"The purser reckons it was a rat; they
get 'em once in a way. along the gang
planks, In dock; actually He quiet till
njght, and then just invade the ship. He's
disturbed them himself, in droves."
"Fact, I assure you."
"He says so?"
"On his oath."
"Then why do they leave the gang
planks in connection with the shore at
night?"
"Why do they do twenty other fool
things?" rejoined the American.
Then Zella went out once more upon
deck. It was a moonlight night. She sat
for a few minutes in the shadow of a ven
tilating shaft, watching the long white
track the moon was making and peopling
it with imaginary angels, when once more
she heard hpr name; this time her real
name, and the voice of Dexter. He was
speaking to the purser. â¢
"It was taksn in the name of Zella
Brunnen," said the purser.
"Then you have escaped a lot of
misery. rd sooner see ghost- than
snakes and bottle imps."
"Hope you may never see either," said
the Englishman. "Let me offer you an
other cigar." . â¢
â¢ "Thank vou."
" I thought a man was dangerous unfler
those circumstances and had to bo re
strained?"
"Ain't you ever had â er â so much, as â
well, a touch of 'em?"
"Never."
"You hare always been a sober man;"
"Mostly."
"He'M been wandering about the deck:
wouldn't have Sam with him; would gr>
n'one: and he's just now told the purser
that there's a ghost aboard. The purser,
ciitunng mm. $uya 'iian or woman, sir?'
And the millionaire, ne pulls up straight
and he says, 'The ghofÂ«; of a man and the
face of a woman he ehould have married;
but' â And there he stopped, repeated ino
story to the 'but' and then crept away as

"D T?" ejaculated the American.
"Think so?" ,- .^"
"Sure so!'."- 7."
wise to retire to her cabin. She had a
light supper sent up to her. Alter supper
she put out her lamp and left the port
holes partly open for the benefit of the
i^ilr. The night was warm, and with an
almost silent sea. On a seat, close by
her cabin, two men sat and talked. Many
a queer conversation has been overheard
through the portholes of deck cabins.
Zella, lying upon her couch, might easily
have spared herself from the temptation
of eavesdropping. She had. Indeed, risen
to close the ports, when, hearing her
name, she paused, more out of self
defonsp than from curiosity.
"Philip Grey," said the voice; "a nice
sort cf young chap; the sight of him
seems to have sobered Dexter."
"How's that?" FAiJ the secorjd voice,
evidently that of an American.
"Says if ever sho nud a brother that'a
him."
"And who's she?" asked tho American.
"He don't say: but the nigger shakes
his head and litts up his hands, palms
out, as much as to let you understand
that Dexter's dotty," the Engllsman re
plied.
"I guess he didn't seem dotty when he
picked up a' full to my flush," said the
American.
"Good morning. Glad to see you: pray
take a sfcat." said Mr. Richard Lorrlmer.
as a liveried porter ushered Zella Into hl3
prlvato room at the .offices of Straker,
Love & Lorrimer. Bedford Row.
Zella bowed, and laying aside the Hsrht
overcoat which she carried on her arm
raid "Thank you." and sat in thÂ« chair to
which, with a wave of hla hand, he drew
her attention.
This was hardly th** kind of reception
she had expected; but she had yet to

It was a great relief to have the at

embarrassed In many waj-s on board ship,
in spite of her arrangements to neutralize
the services of her steward. She had ex
plained at the desk of tho chief porter at
the Grand Hotel that a good deal of her
bapsage belonprd to her cousin, a young
lady, who might possibly occupy the
rooms should she (Philip Grey) be leaving
after a few days: so from the first mo

i.ess before the fond old man until it had
driven him Into that vile plot in which he
had sought to destroy the idol she hart set
up for worship. This being so, how keen
ly must ha have suffered, if not from a
pure love, at least from wounded pride!
But it -were waate of time to follow up
these reflections.
The incident, of Dexter's death seemed
to give a new impulse to ZeUa's journey.
At Liverpool the newspapers contained
Â»n account of "one of the must unhappy
records in the Umbria's Ir>s." The edi
torial pen found the obligatory duties u:
taching to wealth a fascinating theme.
Dexter's mind, It was urged, had given,
way under the v.-e f ght of his responsibili
ties: not that there was any reason to
count the tangibility of his enormous enp
ital. It was, no doubt, the vast measure
of it his very aftluence and the overbur
dening sense of its influences thru had
broken him down. He had literally died
of it. -There was. no mention ol what
Zella bad feared, his alleged love affair,
reported by his man to the purser. IÂ»cx
ter's memory was. indetd. treated with
the greatest "possible respect. During her
journey to &t. Pancraa hlj death had
more than once? formed the sflh.ioct of
conversation on the train within her hear
ing.
What would they say in Chicago?
Would her name be kept oat of the story
of Dexter's career? â¢ â¢ â¢ After all.
what did it matter? There was no one.
whose good opinion she Â£tred for. that
any report such as she han overheard on
the shij) would Influence to her injury.
She would like to stand well with *Ir.
Lorrlroer; and yet. what sort of an opin
ion would he have of her when he knew,
as he mu*t some lay, that she had inter
viewer, him as Phliip Gray?
At Luton she bought a London evening
paper and was soon blushing 1 over it with,
shame and indignation. From the Fast
nest and from Liverpool the English pa
pers had already announced the death of
the American millionaire, and an enter
prising reporter had interviewed "the de
ceased gentleman's negro servant, whi
had been his constant and confidential
man for five and twenty, years." Inter
preting'Sam's "somewhat confused state
ments, given in the vernacular of tho
South, it appeared thai in his old ago
Dexter had fallen deeply in love with hl3
type-writing girl: who was. however,
something more than" an ordinary ynun?
person, being the daughter of a famous
American general, named P.runnen, and
moreover, she was a young woman of;
education, and a leader in a great Chica
go .movement for the advancement of
physical culture among women; - her
name. Zella Brunnen, being quite popular
in the Western city. This young lady de
clined Mr. Dextep's proposals; and that,
to quote his servant's exact words, 'mado
him just awful mad." He had never been
the same man since that day. The nama
of Miss Brunnen brought quite a romance
into the affair. She. was to have married
Edwin Glover, a young London Journalist,
who was killed in a mining 1 camp in Colo
rado, and although Mr. Dexter had of
fered Miss Erunr.cn marriage ho had a
great liking for Mr. Grover. whose death,
had upset him considerablyâ so much so
that one of his Insane fancies on board
the ship was that the ghosts of the dead
Englishman and his fiancee had appeare-I
to him." â¢ â¢ * The reporter went on
to relate the incident of the pocketbook
very much an Zella had overheard it. ThÂ«
letter addressed to the purser, with the
money amounting to upward of fifty
thousand dnllars. was thÂ» only indica
tion of the donor's suicide. "There were
letters In his stateroom addressed to his
lawyers, and one containing a consider-"
able check payable to the order of hia
servant, for whom he furthermore statf'J.
he had made a certain provision in hla
will."
Zella having rend thus far sat silently
with the paper in her hand until she was
aroused to action by the- exigencies o*
railway traveling in England; the rescu
ing of her luggage from other people'?.
the tipping of portrrs and other athlet'c
and financial exercises.
Zella had been aCvised to telegraph In
structions for an omnibus to meet her
train, and rhe had secured rooms by let
ter at the Grand Hotel; so sho was soon
contesting 1 the roadway of the London
streets with thousands of vehicles, her
attention being thu.s won away from tho
revelations of Xhn evening paper by the
novel bustle of London, its vehicular traf
fic altogether different from either New-
York or Chicago, its narrow streets
crowded with people, the myriad lamps
of its shop windows and the gradual light
ing up of its thoroughfares. A fine evon
ln?, almost between the lights of a brlcht
April day: and tP.e wonder of the town
grew upon her. It seemed sordid enough
to begin with. Tho cmnlbus crossed tram
ways onco In Gray's Inn road, but sh>>
passed through square after square, each,
with many trees, like small narks and
with houses all aroundâ solid looking,
gloomy perhaps, but homelike. Lights
were appearing in the windows. Present
ly she pas3ed through comparatively
quiet thoroughfares, and then came into
(he rush of Oxford street, with its mile*
of shops, bright with Illuminated mer
chandise, the roadway alive with nimble
cabs, private carriages, omnibuses and
the flashing lamps of cycles that threaded
their way mysteriously among the vast
procession. In which every vehicle wad
trying to get ahead. By and by she was
In the Strand, tho railway omnlbui still
steering through a mighty crush of traf
fic, the air luminous with many l'.ghta.
When she came to Charing Cross sha
seemed to know it, as if by instinctâ ths
centerfof London, as dear Ned Glover had
described it. "and the center of tho
world." The next minute the omnibus
swung around lntd Northumberland ave
nue and pulled up at the Grand.
Until the second day out she had occu
pied herselfimostly in resting, reading old
letters and ' looking; : at one or two new
bocks, alone in her room. It was not until
the morning of the second day that both
she and Mr. Hiram Dexter met with an
equal surprise In the first and uncorrected
list of passengers. He was no less start
led to read there the name of Miss Zella
Brunnen than she was to come upon tho
entry of "Mr. Hiram Dexter and servant."-
Now she was Indeed confirmed in the wis
dom of maintaining her disguise. She saw
in" it the compensating hand of Fate. At
the same time the fact that her name was
on the Bhlp's list would compel her to be
extremely careful to - order her life on
board bo that she might -not arouse sus
picion. Retiring to her room to consider
the situation, she recalled; minutely her
last Interview , with Dexter-and his base
and brutal attempt to blacken the charac
ter, of Ned Glover.' She. had -been -so en
Â«:rori-fci wnh her mission to Plafs Vnl'ev
ever since that .overythlns; else had.moro
; or Jess, gone out of her memory. 'She had
[put on. wlih her new clothes, such a n*Â»w
Individuality, that the nad at times quite
forgotten 1 herrelf, . Â¦
It -was on the second diy out -that she
saw, shambling along ; the 'deck, - an old
man, who, evory now and then, drew hlm
eclf up,. stiffened his back In an effort to
make out to himself, or for tJ.e behcof of.
Zella folded the missives up and re
placed them In. her portfolio, Intending,
on a later day, to answer them, and have
the (letters mailed from Queenstown. Sha
would, have plenty of time. .It was long
since she had had so much leisure as wad
now before her. . . .Â¦'..Â¦ -.; Â¦ . : -

BRIDGET O'HAGAN."
Zella read the kindly Scotchman's letter,
smiling through her tears at the memories
it aroused. They seemed to belong to a
farback distance of time, much of her
adventurous life being crowded into srÂ»
short a period. She. iolded the screed up
and replaced it in her. writing-case and
drew forth a still more characteristic
epistle, beaming with Irish love and sen
timent. It was a scratchy scrawl from
Bridget O'Hasan herself, which Zella read
over again, for the second time, puzzling
out the bad spelling and the good heart
of It In somewhat the following terms:
'â¢You'll understand, my dear child." he
wrote, "that the heart .of Parkside is wl
ye. . 'Tis not In the. nature of Parkside
to be demonstrative. It. has.' individually
and collectively, a deep affection for ye.
It behoves ye. therefore, to glo us infor
mation concerning \ your happiness, or
otherwise that we may joy wi ye, or sor
row. But after what ye have suffered,
it canna' be in the decrees of >Providence
to afflict ye further. That is our hope
and faith. â¢ Â» â¢ As for our dear Mis
tress O'Hagan, wi her fine nature, though
Irish, we have been solicitous for her re
covery, and It gies. me no end of sat

her strength is not sufficient for more
than two hours a day in an armchair.
But she is quite her old self; Just as Irish
as her discretion and .lovable instincts
will permit. â¢ â¢ â¢ She often talks of
you. and remembers everything 'in

the empty chair, and the undersigned
heaves a, daily sigh for the days when

Amos Storey has called twice, and once
hts pood lady, which we take as a nice
condescension on her part; though we are
a proud community. Nevertheless, Mrs.
Storey being one of the upuer classes of
the city and what they call a leader in
society, and our pride nor yours, dear
child, not running : in that direction, we
are fain to regard her visit as a special
honor. Mr. Storey has been more than
kind in. his Inquiries after Mistress O'Ha
gan: and one evening he sat Â«iulte a time
and had a crack about all manner of sub
jects, not forgetting our Zella, and re
calling incidents honorable and sweet in
his knowledge of you. â¢ â¢ â¢ We look
forward to hear from ye: and it will be
Just a delight to have your impressions

of its own and is vast, I make no doubt,

the cities of the wide, wide world that

Hum.* and Scott, and the Athens of tho
modern world, ye ken. â¢ â¢ â¢ So, God.
bless ye! ? ? â¢ Your servant and friend,
"MALCOLM GLENCOE."
And now that she was fairly rested anl
settling: down to the voyage, she unpack
ed her small portfolio and read the let
ters she had found awaiting her at the
Gllsey I-Iou.ee. First, there was Storey,
repeating his counsels, to be observed by
a young. unattended woman on a voyage
to Kurope. She- smiled, as she thought
of the grim experience of the same young
woman In the mining camps of Platts
valley, and wondered what he would
think of her when the story of the death
of Abner Dfgges, thief and murderer,
should come out, as it assuredly would,
one of these days, however long Old Pru
dent and her other friends might succeed
In keeping It back. Second, there was a
letter from Donald Malcolm Glencoe,
written in a stiff, formal hand, informing
her, in mlgnty llrm sentences, of the good
progress of Mistress Bridget O'Magan to
ward recovery; of the devotion of all con
cerned in maintaining the proper and ef
ficient management of Parks.de; and the
individual and collective solicitude of the
entire household for her safe and com
fortable journey across the sea, and her
happy return.

ON his way hÂ«me the other evening
Mr. Bowser had his feet stepped
or., his hat knocked oft and his ribs
pckÂ»Mj by umbrellas, and by the
time he reached home he was ready for
b. row. To add fuel to his feelings, . he
found that his mother-in-law had arrived
two hours before and was comfortably
Installed at the head of affairs, while
Mrs. Bowser had jtone to bed with a head
ache. Formal gr^tir.gs had scarcely been
exchanged when he said:
"What's all this .twaddle about head
ache? "When I left the house this morn
iv.g Mrs. Bowser was as chirp as a crick
et. Mighty funny that a headache should
flop her into bed all at once."
"There's nothing funny about It."
promptly replied the mother-in-law. "She
had a nervous headache, and 1 told her
to go to bÂ«*d. She looks to ir.e as if her
rorves were all racked to pieces, and she
ought to go home with me for a year."
"That's a!l nonsense. Her nerves are
aU rightâ as right as mine. She's proba
bly been sloshing around In the rain and
got her feet wet. and If so she will get
no pity from me."
"You are not asked nor expected to pity
her, sir. and if you want any dinner you'd
better eat it now. I found the cook very
lazy and impudent and trying to run
thing's to suit herself and therefore I dis
charged her. I've managed to cook a lit
tle something myself, however."
"Youâ you discharged .the cook at an
hour's notice!" he exclaimed, with flushed
fare.
"I gave her seventeen minutes to
got out. I'd like to see a cook or any or.e
c!se trying to walk over my daughter.".
Mr. Bou-fcr sat down to the table, with
his gorge in his threat. The mother-in
l&w hnd thrown down the gauntlet and he
had picked it up.
"It Is .1 picked-up dinner." she explained
as she brought it from the kitchen. "This
Is one of my Irish stev.e, and I know
you'll like it."
"A ptew .for dinner!" he ga:?ped as his
eyes began to roll.
"Certainly, and not much besides,, but
If tt's good enough for me it's good
enough for you. I've heard about your
finding fault with your dinners, but you
can either ect this or let it alone. When
a man gets the idfa that a house Is run
for Ms benefit enly, it's time he was
brought to book."
Mr. Bowser meant to Jump up- an!
pound on th? table and declare that ho
was master of his own house and wouldn't
cat Irish stew for dinner if he starved to
death; but. to his Intense surprise, he
not only clung to his chair, but actually
found himself eating the stew. There
was something in the icy glare of the
woman that had a restraining influence
on his impetuosity. The coffee was weak
and the potatoes underdone, and he had
opened his mouth to declare that he
wouldn't ask a hog to s't down to such
a meal, when the mother-in-law fastened
her eyes on him and said:
"You JuFt kÂ°Â«?p quiet and be thankful
for what you've got. I've known huÂ«
b%nds to make a dinner on raw turnips!"
The pudding Teas flavored with vanilla,
and had Mrs. Bowser been there Mr.
Bowser would have made her heart ache
for a month, but those icy pyes checked
his outbreak and even compelled him to
eat rather generously. It was only when
dinner was finished and they had returned
to the sitting-room that he determined to
Fhake off the incubus and assert his in
dependence.
'â¢I think I'll gr> over to the club for two
or three hours this evening," he observed
as he toyed with the cat.
"You'll do nothing of the kind!" replied
the mother-in-law an she wheeled on him.

Mr. Newman never says a thing to his
dog that he does not mean, and Lion has
learned that he must do what is told him.

about colors.

the metal are Â«>fct in motion, shaking vio
lently one against another. Presently the
surrounding ether is set In motion in
large, slow waves, rolling through the air
i:ke the waves of the sea, until they break
upon our skin, and give us the .sensation
of heat. As the iron gets hotter other
waves are Bet In motion in immense 'num

The redhot iron, getting still more
heated, throws out other sets of waves

colors of the rainbow. The eye cannot tell
one from another; the whole bundle of

drove all thoughts
of his troubles out

"Where are we, bov?" he casoed.
"Fairyland- or heaven?"

The Bad Boy made his wav to Â«the
Copy-rlg-ht, 19O1, by the Press Pub

World.
IT was along toward 6 o'clock in the
evening, and the Bad Boy stood be

down a couple of rough places on/ his
new silk hat. where it had become rui
fied in packing. He was pome to take
the old proceryman out for the even.
ir.pr. and had ser.t that estimable old
gentleman into his room, which ad
joined the Bad Boy's, to get into his
evening clothes, including a hard-boiled
shirt that buttoned up 'the front.
At this moment there came from the
old man's room a series of ejaculations,
more forcible than elegant, and the
groceryman appeared in the doorway,
struggling, red-faced, with the shirt,
which he had on backward.
"Confound this thing!" he exclaimed.
"How'n tarnation am I ever poin' ter
fasten these studs way around in the
small of my back? It don't seem right,
anyway, to have the bosom on my back
and the soft side in front; but I s'pose
it's New York style, so if you'll help me
get it fastened I'll wear it!"
The Bad Boy laughed.
"You've got it Â¦ on wroncr." he ex
claimed, and then he helped the old
groceryman out of the shirt and showed
him how to get it on in the proper way.
"How do I look?" asked the grocery
man when he had finally got into his
clothes.
"Fine," said the Bad Boy. "But you
war.t to look out for kidnapers. If you
don't you'll get stolen, sure."
The old man scouted the idea, and
pot rather huffy at the Bad Boy daring
to pive him advice.
"I kin look out for myself, sonny."
said he. "even if I did fall down a little
this afternoon with that swift vounsr
feller and his â er. sister. You po alonp
find don't worry about me. and I'll meet
you on time at the What-you-call-it
place."
"'The Waldorf-Astoria." said the Bad
Boy. "in an hour. All right, but be
careful."
As soon as the Bad Bov had pone the
old ma'n lost his feelintr of security and
began to wish his young friend were
back again. But he was too much of a
"sport"' to allow this to dampen his
spirits, and, at the appointed time,
started out.
As he strolled throuph the hotel lob
by, trying to look unconcerned, he was
the center of all eyes.
"By gum." said he to himself. "I
puess I ain't lest all my pood looks vet.
Mebbe I'll catch one of them rich wid
ders before I get home."
A cabman drove up to the sidewalk
and the old man hailed him.
"To ihe Waldorf-Astoria." he said,
remembering the name, for a wonder,
"and don't forgit who ycr drivii',
either."
He remembered the Bad Boy's injunc
tion to give the name of some bip man
every time he hailed a cab. so as not to
have it cost him anything, and beins:
unable to think of any other, he added:
"I'm Rrssell Sage."
The cabman looked at him. but seem
ed satisfied and drove off. In a few min
tites the cab stopped before the Thirty -
fourth street entrance to the Waldorf-
Astoria, zr.d the old man erot out and
started off. But the moment he stepped
on the pavement he was bewildered. He
had expected some nuaint little inn.
from the Bad Boy's description, but
what he saw stagcered him. At the
fame moment the cabman was uaoa
him.
"Here. Mr. Sage." he exclaimed,
"aren't you forgetting something?"
"Go on." said the old man. "don't ver

Just what happened next he never
knew, but he found himself flat upon
the ground with the cabman on top of
him. It would have been serious, but
just then there was a stir in the crowd
which had instantly gathered and the
Bad- Boy. who had been attracted bv
the excitement, jumped into the melee
and separated the combatant*.
Pulling the old man to his feet. - he
began *o explain to the cabman.

It having bÂ«ea apparently supposed that It
would be p;cssili!o for these men to move
along the line and to dlaUJbuta ammuni

We very soon learned that such a system,
could not b* of any use under modern
'conditions. The men carrying up the am
munition would inevitably be shot befor3
reaching the front, and the men on the

V':-' Immigration has i poured Into Brazil. so
profusely of late and the commerce of
tbe greatest country of South America
has grown no that the Minister at Wash
ington is increasingly busy and must
needs be a constant student of affairs.
It is two years since Senhcr J. F. de Assls
Brasil assumed the duties of this impor
tant post, and no one has made greater
strides In official and private esteem at
the American capital than he.
He is a clever amateur photographer as
well as a marksman, and Is quick at re
partee, as Instanced by a remark he mado
when somebody said: ""Wait an Instant,
Benhor; I want to make a snap shot."
"Oh. don't do that." he said, raising his
hand to his face deprecatlngly; "rather
try a rifle shot."
"Why, that would be more dangerous."
"Ferhap3 not," was the retort. "A riflu
ehot kills, but a snap shot sometimes
ilnys a reputation, you know."
But perhaps the most astonishing fea*
of dexterity he performs with five
matches without the aid of a gun. He
calls It his "gun carriage demonstration."
It is a sort of fancy billiard shot exhibi
tion, and merely shows the marvelous del
icacy of touch that will come from long
practice. It Is usually done across the
width of a dining-room table.
ThÂ« sun carriage is made ef three
matches laid in the form of a letter H.
with the foot of the H parallel to the.
table's edge. A fourth match 1* fald over
the cross bar of the "pun carriage." Ilka
the barrel of a cannon resting: on its trun
nions, with the butt end ef the match
projecting a quarter of an inch beyond
the edge of the table, and tr.e hÂ»ad point
ing to the opposite side. Across the table
a fifth match is stood up on end in a salt
cellar. Taking: an ordinary dinner knife
the Minister bends the blade back like
the spring of a catapult and strikes the
"gun" sharply on the butt. It flies across
the table and knocks down the upright
match, about half the time striking It
squarely on the head and lighting both
matches. .'
People who have never seen th's done
rarely believe It possible, but the Minis
ter has ao far converted all of his lntl
mato friends by an actual demonstration.
When some one allowed Â«n account of
this little diversion to pet Into print tha
Minister was provoked, because ha
thought the opinion might become current
that he was a sort of parlor magician.
whereas he la really a conscientious, en
ergetic, well-rounded business man an<l
devoted to the duties of his office. It Â»Â»
only when affairs of state have been dis
posed of that Minister Erasit Indulges h!s
penehant for firearms and delights those
congenial friends who have the entree oÂ£
his house.

Good progress Is being made by the vari

floral pageants, dances and receptions will
be the features.

county and shall pass through a point
about one mile north of the village of
Coyote, the place -where Wheeler
struck an inexhaustible supply of
water, which he sought to sell to
farmers and orchardists for $7 an
acre. \
! This dividing line will take away
from Santa" Clara County the enor
mous benefits it has received from
the Coyote Creek. This line, so sig
nificantly drawn through this point,
will place in the proposed ntw county
of Las Animas the enormous natural
reservoir of Glen Willis and the great
subterranean â¢ stream at Coyots. The
new county government could give to
whomever it pleased a monopoly of
this water and the owners of the
water. could use their possession to
their best advantage, to levy tribute
upon the farmers and orchardists of
Santa Clara County, to act as con
tributor or. competitor to tho Spring
Valley Water Company of San Fran
' And to add to the excitement which
these facts have produced in this city
and in the < valley, it is known that
Colonel E. G. Wheeler has been here
since the proposition of county divis
ion was made and has had surveys
made of Glen Willis, the great natur
al-'reservoir. It is known also that
property in the neighborhood of the
glen and which would naturally af
fect water fights has been placed un
der . . v
THE CATTLE KING'S CAMPAIGN".
These facts have ' created serious con
sternation among people who realize the
grave consequences which, must arise
from such a division. More . particularly
is this the fact since It is notorious that
the. machine politicians are heartily In
favor ; of the ; scheme of division. John
Mackenzie and Jim Rea. the. local bosses,
are , as one upon this subject. They see
in division many material advantages to
themselves, and are- urging that ' in the
scheme a" part of San Benlto County be
taken and, added to the proposed county
of Las Anlmas. ..
" So . far. has this plotting . gone that Â¦ It Is
common gossip on the streets of San Jose
that State Senator Oneal, the friend, as

SECRET; OF ; THE 'SCHEME.
He thought, he had found a bonanza.
That was five years ago' and It was his
purpose to tap the/crcek.v pipe the water,
secure from â¢ the . ' Supervisors of Santa
Clara County exclusive rights and sell the
water of ,Coyote '-. Creek â¢ to farmers and
orchardists for 'the comfortable sum of
$7 Â¦ an , acre. ' The scheme was a splendid
one for Wheeler, but "the Supervisors of
Santa Clara County, could not accept his
view of the case, refused him the request
ed privileges arid condemned this particu
lar \'promotion' r ' of the Eastern speculator
to failure. . Wheeler^ picked * up < his traps
and went a way .t'.' But he. came back 'a few
months' ' ago under: conditions * which ex
cited the gravest .apprehensions lnHhe
minds of those who do not care to see the
waters of the Coyote [diverted as Wheeler
wished: to divert them. -
Â¦ But the ; tremendous value of Coyote
Creek: as a water supply did not escape
other eyes. Colonel E-.G. Wheeler; whose
present address" is. 1' Broadway,'.room>-18,
New York, saw-an opportunity. to make
aptake. Colonel Wheeler is :a, promoter
and' speculator Interested in any scheme
which promises a" profit.-'" "Wheeler began
his operations on Coyote Creek at the lit
tle village of Coyote, which Is ; eight miles
north of. Madrone and about twelve miles
south" of San" Jose. The result 'of these
operations was instantaneous. Wheeler
ditched and dug and discovered a practi
cally Inexhaustible, supply of- water. . ,
Twelve, years ago Arthur G. Field and
Dan, Murphy saw . 'that. Glen Willis, tho
ravine in which the three big creeks meet
and become one. was a stupendous nat
ural' reservoir. In " which j millions upon
millions of gallons of pure water .from an
inexhaustible source could* be stored. All
that is necessary to make this reservoir
la to construct a dam at the northern end,
and there would then be a gigantic^ res
ervoir a mile in length, half a mile wide
and at least ,150 feet deep. Murphy and
Field saw thia splendid opportunity to
seize upon a great monopoly. They could
takeaway the water, of the Coyote" Creek
from the upper Santa Clara ; Valley, pipe
It and sell It at a certain figure for each
acre to farmers and orchardists. ' Work
was at once .begun on. the dam, but it
was never completed, and foundations and
bridges tell now by their ruins in the glen
of the work that was never finished. /
In It three creeks meet and merge Into
one, which leaves the glen and continues
its northern way as Coyote Creek to Al
vlso Bay. The streams which, contribute
ln\thlB.'glen to the Coyote are Packwood
Creek and Las Anlmas Creek, the name
which It, is proposed to^ give' to ! the new
county^ It is" the Coyote . Cife*ek" which
iHvf s Â¦. to Santa Clara County In Its north
ern. part its wonderful water supply.", This
creek has an enormous watershed of the
best possible quality of 275* or 300 square
miles.
;Â¦ Throughout. the year this creek, with Its
contributions from the Packwood and Las
Animas,. pours -Its tremendous volume of
wWter.intV the Upper Santa Clara Valley,
feeding the soil, 1 sustaining it and.enrich
ing farm and orchard lands. Everts have
estimated that only one- fourth of the wat
er j of . the " Coyote- passes' -into the ' bay.
the other three-fourths being absorbed by
the, lands through which the creek flows.
There is no controversy as]p the tremen
dous value of the stream, nor have'specu
lators been" blind to its commercial value
as a monopoly.

This glen, which is known as Glen Willis,
is a natural reservoir. ' -,v*
These are facts which have given the
people of San Jose and the upper Santa.
Clara Valley food for very serious
thought. With Eastern speculators op
erating to secure a monopoly of -water,
which Is of vital moment to the county;
with politicians scheming for new power
and patronage, and with a cattle kins
whose only natural thought Is for his own
best interest, the plot for division has as
sumed dangerous proportions and has ex
cited the people of the upper part of th#
valley and the county to the necessity off
doing something at once or bearing the
burden of what they believe will be an
injury from which they cannot recover. -

Thompson, aged 21, son of G. W. Thomp
son, a wealthy and prominent. farmer liv
ing three miles southeast of Steward, has
disappeared under most suspicious cir
cumstances, and fears that he has been
kidnaped for a reward have prostrated his
mother and driven his father almost to
distraction. Thursday evening the young
man left home on horseback, telling his
mother he was going into Seward and
would '>e back in a short time. Several
hours later the horse he rode returned to
the farmhouse without rider or bridle.
The neighborhood was Instantly aroused
and search for the young man instituted,
but up to this hour no trace of him has
been found. . He never reached town and
no one In that vicinity can be found" who
paw him after he left home. The whote
country for miles around Is greatly exer
cised over his disappearance and search
ing parties are scouring the country In all
directions. His parents are almost insane
over the matter, and a reward of $1500 has
been offered for his return or for informa

whereabouts. Frank G. Thompson is a

In hope or reward. All towns in the vi

failed to accomplish his object, was ar
rested . shortly after the occurrence and
taken to the office of the Chief of Police,
which was quickly surrounded by an
angry mob, numbering nearly one thou
sand, breathing threats of vengeance.
Miss Roth is employed at one of the
large stores and was going home to her
supper. She soon became aware that she
was followed and within a few' blocks of
her home entered a neighboring house for
the purpose of throwing the man off her
track. Alexander kept on and Miss Roth
again started home, and when at a point
nearly opposite the residence of Professor
Evans of the High School she was met
by Alexander, who seized her around the
throat and bore her to the ground. In
falling his finpers slipped from her throat
long enough to enable her to give a cry
for help. This cry was heard by Professor
Evans, who responded, when the assailant
left the girl and fled.
A crowd had gathered, among them a
young colored girl, who told who the as
sailant was. The police were notified and
Officer McDonald f ent out When at
Seventh and Cherokee streets Jhe officer

arrest him the negro attempted to escape,
but a blow from the efficer's club reduced
him to submission, when he was taken to

like wildfire and In a few moments the
streets aroundthe station- were filled with
a mass of excited men, demanding to
lynch Alexander if. he could be obtained.

ran. climbed and stumbled over the chairs
en the way to the doors.
Around the upper part of the hall ex

end. Here -were seated 100 -women and
children, and two men at tbe farther end
of the balcony, away from the stairway,
eecing that the rush toward the exit was

the little ones over the railing to the floor,
ten feet below. The children fell Into the

On the main floor the crush was much

and firemen who came hurrying" to the

As soon as the news of the panic had

,, AUSTIN, Texas, Jan., 12.â There, is wild
'excitement throughout Southeast j Texas
over the. wonderful oil strike that has Just
been made three miles south of Beaumont.
The well Is owned by C. W. Lucas, who
to-day succeeded in making a test of the
flow, showing that the output for one hour
was more than. 700 barrels. At this rate
the well has a flow of 18.000 barrels per
day of twenty-four hours.
It Is the greatest oil strike in the his
tory of that' industry. The oil spouts out
of a six-inch pipe to a heightof seventy
five feet In a solid stream. The pressure
is bo great that no cap, can be placed on
the well and nearly EO.000 barrels of oil
have flowed Into the ravines -near the well.
These ravines are being drained as rapid
ly as possible, but many thousands of bar
rels of oil- have already gone to waste.
Prices of land in the vicinity of the well
have gone soaring skyward. One tract of;
ten acres j sold for $50,000. Fabulous of

EN0BM0US WEALTH IN WATER.
The most serious aspect of ] the whole
proposition,' of division Is unquestionably
that In which Santa , Clara County Is
threatened wltlrtluv loss of the tremen
dous water supply, which . has been of
such imme"asurable^bencflt to the county.
If the'division of the county Is 'made an
These three powerful interests, it is
claimed â speculative, political'; and com
mercialâare in a great combination to
divide . the county . and bring ruin to the
entire upper part of it. . Before division
is made, however, a most stubborn fight
will have' to be made. Opposition will be
agitated from - now. on until the proposed
measure, which has not , yet been, intro
duced, has been' defeated. â¢ This contest,
which has interested more people in. San
Jose than'any other'ln year's, promises to
provoke a series of sensations.
He has clashed time and again with the
authorities of '.Santa Clara County, over
the manner In which he has conducted
his cattle business. Many of hla cattle
have been condemned and he has been put
to the recourse Â¦ of expensive"- litigation.
He makes no secret of the fact, therefore,
that. he wants a county consisting almost
exclusively of dairy lands' and In which
his vast' interests will be protected and
considered as he wants them to be. Â¦Â¦-, His
new county he .would call Las Anjmas.
. And there Is still a 1 . third element hi
what the people -of .the northern- part .of
the county believe to be a mammoth plot
to ruin them, destroy their orchards and
farms and immeasurably injure. Sari Jose
as a depot for the products of the county.
This third element ' is .represented ; by
Henry Miller, the cattle 'king, who thus
far ha-? been the only avowed and open
advocate' of division.- , Miller; has. abso
lutely no concern for 'the orchard and
farm landof the county. Heotyns vast
tracts of land- In the southern part of the
county and uses it for its only available
purposeâ dairy land. . ; Â¦
.But Eastern speculators are^noj^tlje. only
men leagued to seeucc a division of thÂ«
county. There is net the .^lightest ques
tion that a powerful political combination
is In. the scheme not only: to secure ad
ditional patronage., ior a clique * of 'poli
ticians which has operated ; In San Jose
for many years, "out for future political
contingencies which may arise and .which
may make a new county government ..an
extremely valuable â¢ adjunct for success/
So far has. this political phase of the
scheme gone that it Is common Kossip in
San Joee : who are to' flll ' the j' most Im-'
portant offices in- the new county. Â¦
PLOT OF THE POLITICIANS.
This very scheme has been tried before.
The men who first atterapted.lt are, again,
in the field. If success rewards their ef
forts they will gain absolute control of
an enormous water supply , which . may
serve them in a variety of ways. If Santa
Clara County loses this supply,' which It
now enjoys,, an Irreparable Injury, it, is
claimed, will be worked to the splendid
orchard lands of the county.' :Tolose this
supply, the objectors to division Insist,
means ruin to Santa Clara County. And
it Is significant that the line of proposed
division is drawn just so as to place the
tremendous water supply within the
northern boundary of the new county.
The people of this city particularly are
in deep interest and already a sensation
has developed In. the affair. It Is charged,
and there is much to support the accusa
tion, that in the division of the county
Eastern speculators and promoters j have
schemed to secure control . of a gigantic
water supply, which Is one of the most
essential resources, if not absolutely the
vital one, of the county. This water sup
ply, which now contributes -vastly to tho
richness of the county, will, under the
proposed division, be . taken out { of the
county, can be converted Into a monopoly
and may be piped, if occasion demands, to
San Francisco.

This widespread protest has not yet cry
stallized Into any definite action, but
prominent citizens are agitating the ne
cessity of Immediately holding- ! mass
meetings, educating public opinion and
importuning the Legislature not to inflict
upon the county what they believe will be
the most serious Injury of Its history.

none is more interesting than Assembly
bill No. 112, introduced by James of Los
Angeles. It is based on 'the Mln'nesota
and Wisconsin laws, , which are modified
in It in conformity with California laws.
The feature of the law is a direct vote
at the primary election for the, party nom
inees. Instead of voting for delegates to
State, county and city conventions, the
elector votes directly for candidates for
nomination to the various offices, .
Party conventions may still beheld, but
their purpose will be to settle party pol
icy, to formulate party platforms and
possibly to Indorse in convention the can
didacy of individuals. But the ascend
ency in such convention of any clique or
boss cannot prevent the majority of the
electors qf a party from nominating at
the primary candidates who j-epresent its
wishes. â¢
Any number of electors associated to
gether for political purposes are entitled
to a column on the official primary ballot
Any person is eligible to be a candidate
for nomination who is a qualified elector

the character and time of Examinations
and similar questions. Thomas J. Kirk,
State Superintendent of Schools, was
shown the measures before their Intro-'
duction and he did not hesitate to express
his disapproval. He said this evening:
"The Superintendent of Schools of San
Francisco occupies a unique position.
Legally he is in the position of the County
Superintendent, while in the practical
working out of his duties he is a city
superintendent.' The '"bills which Mr.
Kirgfbury showed to me are praiseworthy
if the San Francisco schools alone are to
be- considered. They seek to give Super
intendent Webster only such powers as it
Is desirable that he. as a city superin
tendent, should possess. But in doing
that, the method employed is to enlarge
the powers and multiply the duties of
county superintendents.
"Now {J\q county superintendents do
not want the Increase of duties, because
the discharge of them is practically im
possible. It Is absurd to expect a county
superintendent who has oversight of 140
schools, for instance, to devote attention
to the grading of individual pupils. The
county sui>erintendent must devote most
of his attention to the administrative
side, while the city superintendent can
concern himself more directly with what
is termed the professional side of school
work.
"There ought to be some way to remedy
the unsatisfactory condition in San Fran
cisco without the enactment of laws which
will be unjust in their operation over the
remainder of the State. In my opinion
these* bills will not bocome laws, for coun
ty superintendents and city superintend
ent^ all over the State will be a unit in
opposition to them."

NEW BILLS IN
THE ASSEMBLY
Two years ago. after the discontinuance
cf the normal school by the city Board
of Education, a bill was introduced In the
Legislature making: the school a State in
stitution and, providing an appropriation
of $50,000 for its maintenance. This bill
went through, but there was not sufficient
to do more than provide payment for the
teachers and the incidental expenses of
the school, and so it continued to hold
sessions in the Girls' High School build
in*.
Several bills have been Introduced in the
Senate which are designed to confer cer
tain powers upon the Superintendent of
the San Francisco schools. In order that
it may not lxÂ» special legislation, the
measures are framed to enlarge the pow
ers of county superintendents, and in so
doing duties are laid upon such officers as
are not desired by them and which do not
meet the approval of educators through
out the State. Among the added powers
are those of grading pupils, determining
the number cf pupils that may be assigned
to a room, the number of desks to a room.
MENTO, Jan. 12.â There is under prepara
tion for presentation to the Legislature
a bill to provide an appropriation of $100.
000 for the erection of buildings and the
purchase of the necessary furniture to
e<juip a State Normal School in San Fran
cisco. The Board of Education of San
Krancipco will request from the Board of
Supervisors permission to transfer a lot
adjoining thÂ» Girle' Hiph School on Scott

pose?, contingent upon the passage of the
Lill providing the $100,000 appropriation.

HEALTH OF QUEEN
Â¦Â¦ CAUSES ANXIETY
Eyes Source of Much Suffering and
Events of the Past Year Have
Preyed on Her Nerves.
Special Cnble to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright. 1801, by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
LONDON, Jan. 12.â The greatest care Is
being taken to keep lnf( rmation- as to tha
real state of the Queen's health out of the
newspapers, although every now and then
leakages occur. If all I hear from private
sources is true her .Majesty's entouraj;*
are more .than concerned over the state
of her health. Her ev-?s, too, are causing
a great deal of sulerlng. A well-known
oculist is comics over from Germany next
week to see not only ilie Queen but Prin
cess Christian.
HABRIS IS MENTIONED
AS GBIGGS' SUCCESSOR
The Queen has, had to bear during the
last year more than the usual burden of
sorrow and anxiety that befalls most
women of her age. Tiih war has prey od
on her nerves to an alarming extent. The
deaths of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg. PinÂ«*e
Christian Victor and Lady Jane Church
ill, have boen terrible i lows to her. Add
to these the ever-preÂ«ent anxiety about
the Empress Frederick and her indigna
tion at the way the Princess Artbert of
Anhalt has been treated by her worthier
husband and it is not astonishing that her
health should be far from satisfactory.

Aristocratic swimming schools In England
are causing a sensation and grievance.
Ladies have taken up this form of
keenly, and championships for women are
being instituted ail over the country. An
amateur swimming association has caused
a thunderclap by sending out an an
nouncement that in future female com
petitors will be allowed to wear only black
or dark blue costumes. The reasons
given are the danger to the skin from the
shades of red which are bo popular, but
the action was really prompted by several
fashionable swimmers appearing ln such
light shades of pink that the spectators
were startled out of all interest ln the
contest.
There died in London this week In pov
erty a character once well known in New
York and London and Parisâ Henry A. de
Lille, who married Olive Logan years ago.
He was connected with several New York
newspapers. While in Paris he greatly
aided, in a confidential capacity, Napo
elon. One of his sons was formerly Con
sul at Sheffield, and l.e was made a Chev
alier of the Legion of ; Honor by Napo
leon. Poverty and illness made his clos
ing days tragic.
Another death. this week was that of
James de Foe, the last male descendant of
the author 6f "Robinson Crusoe." He was
SO years old.
The visit of the Prince of Wales to the
Duke and Duchess of Devonshire at
Chatsworlh was one of the most bril
liant affairs of the kind ever known. Earls
and countesses and other members of the
nobility elbowed each other in the spa
clous halls. The women were magnifi
cently dressed, wearing their family
diamonds. The private theater was
transformed into a veritable Ghetto of
beauty. Miss Muriel Wilson was gener
ally conceded to be the handsomest of the
performers, who, â¢ with the taste ho often
noticed in English amateurs, elected to
play "The Pantomime ReheaTsal," a bur
lesque of the shortcomings of amateurs
themselves. The visit terminated to-day.
William Waldorf Astor entertained a
big party at Cliveden on Thursday. A
few Americans v/ere Invited and no very
great ladles were present. This was the
lirst time Miss Astor has taken up the po
sition of mistress of "her father's home.
The prettiest American girl present wa3
Mrs. Harry Hlggins* daughter. Miss
Breeze, who was in lilac satin. Among the
few military men present was Captain
Ames of the Life Guards, the tallest man
ln the British army.
Senator Proctor's Italian marble corner
draws forth from To-Day an indignant
protest. It says:
"Who, for instance, is Senator Proctor,
that he should create lor his own enrich
ment a Fcarcity of Carrara marble, in
which the highest art of all ages in Eu
rope has found its noble expression." and
so on in a similar strain, maintaining
that the Senator has no right to assume
a dictatorship of the world's art.
But it is not only in commerce that the
spread of American leaven ia so patent.
In the national game, Rugby football,
hitherto so distinctive of American rules,
and whose devotees wore so proud of the
fact, the British are now beginning to
closely imitate the distinguishing features
of gridiron play. At the recent Kngland
and Wales match, when 40,000 spectators
were present, the experts were amazed to
see what was called the "puzzling hand
to-hand passing of the Welsh team."
This Was nothing more than the familiar
snapping back practiced by all American
colleges, but which i? a revelation hero.
It had no small effect in securing for
Wales a sweeping victory.

"Small wonder, indeed," says the Daily
Telegraph, "tnat the British fruit-grower
has cause for complaint that the Demand
is not what it was tor his products." Cal
ifornia fruit appears to be making tre
mendous inroads into the English Jam
trade
The Daily Telegraph calls attention to
the enormous increase in the use of Amer
ican confectionery in Kngland, which, it
says, would be even greater than it is
were the American manufacturers to
show more elasticity in trade methods.
It also declares that America, is soon like
ly to be supplying "jaw brftks." The most
suitable campaigning samples have al
ready been submitted to .Lord Roberts
and have been sent back for improvement.
These are now assured.
Drury's invention is described as the

Tho great woolen and allied trades
threaten to be revolutionized by an Amer
ican machine which Is now operating- at
Bradford. "What it all will open up Is
not fully apparent at first sight," says the
Bradford Observer, "but it looks as if the
position at present occupied by Arkwright
and Crompton in the world of inventors
during the nineteenth century is to be
superseded by Drury in the twentieth.
How is it that this idea was left to a
Yankee lawyer to bring out?"
"Lost opportunity," says the Morning
Post, "is the keynote, and the Britain
which could dictate its will to the ends
of the earth is to-day a myth."
LONDON, Jan. 12.-Great Britain's de
cadence is becoming quite a popular
theme. Self-debasement and self-flagella
tion seem to be congenial to the chastened
spirit of the nation, forced to realize,
through the accumulation of reverses,
military, diplomatic and industrial, that
Great Britain's predominance dream, la
past. It is almost a dally occurrence for
some great Ixmdon newspaper to parade
the shortcomings of the country. Institut

DECADENCE OF

IS ADMITTED
PARIS, Jan. 12.â Ugly stories are leak-
Ing out concerning the behavior of part
of the crew of the steamer Russle,
wrecked off Faraman, Bouches-du-Rhone,
Monday, whose crew and passengers,
numbering 102 persons,, were rescued by
boats from the shore yesterday. The
Matin publishes an interview with a pas
senger who said tne conduct of some of
the sailors was beneath contempt. The
Hrst mate had to enforce obedience at the
muzzle of a revolver and waa obliged to
pass the nights with his loaded pistol ln
nis hand. These assertions are confirmed
by two lady passengers. The other pas
sengers, adds the correspondent, while
praising the ofncVrs, maintain a signifi
cant silence regarding the seamen.
A correspondent â¢ of the Petit Parisien
alleges that discord prevailed on board
ln consequence of the conduct of two
women, vaudeville artists, and certain
other passengers, declaring that scandal
ous incidents occurred in the smoking
100m between them and the officers, de
spite.the fact that all on board appeared
to be on the threshold of death. The cor
respondent adds:
"it is asserted that the officers surrep
titiously favored these women, giving
them an unfair allowance of biscuits and
oranges. These rumors spread to the
ciew, who seized on them as a pretext
to start a little mutiny. The seamen
refused to do duty, saying there was no
longer any discipline on board; that ln
face of the common peril every one
had the right to save his own skin and
that the common danger made all equal.
Matters came to such a point that the
first mate, after a refusal of obedience,
was- obliged to threaten the mutineers
with a revolver. Order was .restored, but
not entirely, as the quarrel broke out
anew on landing."
A correspondent of the Petit Parisien
sends the following statement:
"A Faiior tells me that when the Cairo
lifeboat ran alongside the Russie, Cap
tain Jouve stood at the gangway with a
revolver in his hand to prevent any in
cident calculated to jeopardize the good
order of the disembarkation."
Tho passengers of the Russie who were
interviewed to-day draw a terrific pic
ture of the suffering endured and of the
scarcity of food. The last nlpht passed on
the steamer was especially trying. Many
persons gave way in despair, one woman
begging a soldier for his revolver ln or
der that sho might shoot herself.
Â¦ The insubordination of the crew, the
passengers say, was partly due to the
question of distribution of food. A fireman
declared that the sailors ought to be fed
first, and the same man refused to do any
work and the captain had to press his re
volver to the man's forehead before the
fttter, would obey orders.
The first subscription for the rescuers
has readied the. sum^of 11,000 francs.

William A- Eddy, a Nerv York Elec-
triciau, Tells of Having Received
a Series of Signals From
High Altitudes.
KEAV YORK. Jan. 12.â William A. Eddy
of Bayonne, X. Y.. says that since 1S92 he
has drawn from his kite. wire hundreds of
electric signals, both regular and irregu
lar, which mav have come from some
planet, and the signals have been usually
in groups of three, regularly timed, like a
Morse sounder. When the ends of the
kite-sustained Fteel wires are separated
ky silk etrands the sparks jump at
twelve-second intervals. Then there are
mysterious disappearances of all electric
action for several minutes. These electric
eparks come from a high Â»>olnt ln the air
not near to the low-tension electric cur
rents of trolley and live wires.
Mr. Eddy Is about to begin a careful
series of measurements of these spark
lengths. He does not believe that the
Morse sounders affect his wire- because
the dynamo electricity sticks to Its wire
s.nd does not radiate to unknown dis
tances, so far as known, as do the high
tension Eparks used in wireless telegraphy
and the fame high-tension sparks drawn
by him from the clouds.
Mr. Eddy says that these spark signals
xne.y come from an outer planet, because
electricity travels at the rate of 190.0W
miles a. second and is as tireless as light,
Â¦which travels 1SS.300 miles a second, as
measured by the rapidly revolving
toothed wheel. Great variability ln effect
Is produced when there is apparently no
change whatever in the condition of the
upper air. so far as known.
Mr. Eddy has been trying to decipher
thoee signals since 1Â«*2. It is also to bÂ»
noted that Teslas signals come from
Pike's Peak and at a nigh point ln the
sir Mr. Eddy points out that electricity
is superior to lisrht because an interrup
tion can be transmitted while light f*if
fuses around a dark shadow, especially
it tho shadow is of smaller diameter.
VON BULOW
NOT TRUSTED
BY AGRARIANS
Chancellor Working Se
cretly for Canal
Bill.
Speech Delivered in the Diet
Has Been Changed in the
Manuscript.
BERLIN, Jan. 12.â The opening speech
of the Imperial Chancellor, Count von Bu
low. in the Prussian Diet Tuesdaj', which
was largely programmatic, is here con
sidered the leading political event of the
week. The entire press 1b still busy com
menting on and interpreting his remarks.
Only the extreme Leftists are wholly dis
satisfied therewith, claiming the Chancel
lor has gone over, bag and baggage, to
the Agrarians, while the moderate Left
ists. Center and Nationalists point out
that the Chancellor carefully avoided defi
nite terms in his speech, and that hence
he probably Intends to shape hl3 Prus
sian policy, especially during the forth
coming Diet session, according to how
and where he finds the majority favoring
the canal bill, about whose ultimate pas
sage Emperor "William Is still as anxious
as ever. The Conservative and Agrarian
press handle Von Bulow's speech with ex
treme caution. They avoid pledging sup
port of the canal bill in exchange for any
possible bargain. The Agrarians continue
to distrust Von Bulow.
The Kreuz Zeitung, Conservative, while
pleasant by complimenting the Chancel
lor, warns the latter not to repeat Prince
Hohenlohe's punitive methods toward
members of the Diet, who are also Gov
ernment employes, for voting against the
canal measure.
A sigmificant little Incident is this. Von
Bulow's speech as actually delivered ln
the Diet spoke of Increased cereal duties
for the protection of German agriculture,
while the corrected manuscript several
hours later, as It left Von Bulow's hands,
mentioned only "gesicherter zollutsch,"
meaning "assured duty protection." This
manipulation has not escaped attention
and there are all sorts of surmises con
nected therewith.
In the best informed Parliamentary cir
cles the opinion Is now held that Von Bu
low himself hardly knows where he
stands, and that he will ekillfullv en
deavor to push the canal bill through the
Diet with whatever not too exacting
words he can find. It certainly would be
very unlike Von Bulow to conclude a fixed
bargain thjs early with any party or set
of parties.
The China bill will not be disposed of
by the Relchstae for some time, as tho
Bundesrath has only just received the
Government bill fixing- the China soldiers'
pensions.
German political circles opine that the
Chinese problem is still a long way off
from a. definite solution, as the question
of damages will occupy much time in Pe
king. Nobody here believea that Field
Marshal Count von Waldersee or the Ger
man troops will be withdrawn by March.
The opinion here rather inclines to an
other year elapsing before that happens,
although it is well known that Russia
strongly desires Von Waldersee's retire
ment and that of the German troops.

SEmOUS CHANCES.
Are Taken in Neglecting a Simple
Case of Files.
Any person takes serious chances in ne-
glecting an attack of piles, because of the
tendency to become chronic and further
the danger of ulceration and forming of
fistula, both very, difficult to cure. â¢ .
v Most. pile cures are simple ointments or
salves, which relieve temporarily but are
useless : as far as making a cure is con-
cerned. ' 1 'Â¦Â¦'- Â¦
The safest remedy for any form of piles
whether itching or protruding is the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure because free from cocaine
and opiates. Â¦--.It Is in suppository form to
be used at night and painless and causes
no detention from daily occupation, and
the many cures made by it have made it
famous in every corner of the United
States and j Canada and any druggist will
tell ; you "Â¦ it' enjoys a greater demand and
popularity than any pile remedy ever
placed on the market. " . " '
Mr. James Kenton of Memphis, Tenn.,
says :>*_'Ii' suffered from Itching piles for
.two years and found nothing that would
ielieve me permanently; not, even mer-
curial ointment seemed to reach my/case.
But a 50 cent box -of' the Pyramid Pile
Cure. < which I bought at my .druggist's,*
cured me entirely, and' for, months. past: I
have had no return s of the disease."
Mrs. William Kenmore of South' Omaha,
writes : ;' "I ' suffered torture : from protrud-
ing; piles for a- large . part .of my life and
had long since given up any hope of cure,
as I dared not risk an operation and could
not ; afford .the J expense any way. w ;i had
often read advertisements about the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, but never placed confidence
in patent ; medicines,-: but I tried s the : Pyra-
mid in â¢ sheer Â¦ desperation, ';Â¦ and ; was de-

He told his story at nls boarding-house
that very night and amazed and fascin

Duke of "Westminster, â¢ had just died in
Lincolnshire, England, and he l\?d fallen
not only to an estate of millions oÂ£ pounds
sterling but into a dukedom as well. He
showed a couple of papers signed by
Queen Victoria anahio word and the pa

him to quit work and live off his credulous
friends. He began to ' borrow, right and

all kinds of. pay: when his remittance ar

MANILA, Jan. 12.â Since the expiration
cf the period within which amnesty was
{rranted to captured insurgents the lnsur
rectos have been sent to Manila in
batches of dozens, scores and hundreds.
It is but a month since the military gov
ernment began retention of the prisoners
of war and already the quarters fitted up
to hold them are filled. To-day 1500 insur
gents are in confinement in this city, ex
clusive of several hundred natives, so
called political prisoners, most of whom
may also be classed as insurgents.
The question as to what is to - be done
with these prisoners of war appears to be
wholly undetermined. They have not been
tried or sentenced and apparently are un
likely to be for a long time to come. They
are brought ln by rail and by steamer and
a few were arrested within the city. Â¦ Â¦
Practically all the war prisoners thus
far brought ln are confined in the Cuartel
Malate, on inclosure. containing four long
double barnllke wooden buildings, built
for troops barracks, bnt lately trans
formed into prisons by the addition of
bolts on the doors and bars across the
windows. A pair of these buildings are
occupied by a couple of battalions of the
Third : and Sixth Artillery, stationed on
guard. The others are the prisons. Somt
300 natives are confined in each of the four
wings, which measure, each about SO by
150 feet. Four platforms, each six feet
wide, run nearly the length of the build-
Ings. Upon these the captives sleep, Jy
ing crosswise in four long rows. For an
hour at midday the prisoners' friends are
admitted to the yard.
in the Philippines.
General Young attributes the recent
wholesale surrenders in his district large
ly to the fear of deportation to Manila or
elsewhere, an apprehension .which is ax
ceedingly developed especially among na
tives who have been trying to maintain
friendship both with the Americans and
the insurgents. -

TUTUrLA. Samoa, Jan. lJ-^On the 16th
of December a brutal murder of a China
man was committed; in Apiv The mur
dered Inan's head had been clubbed and
his throat cut and the body then thrown
Into, thÂ© river at the back of , his, home.
The receding tide left the :body exposed
and it was discovered <he next morning
by two girls who were passing by. Sev
eral iiersons have been arrested by the
German authorities and are held await

The money, amounting to over 541.000,
which the Governments of Great Britain, 1
Germany and the United" States promised
to pay tho Samoans for the surrender of
their arms after the last war, is now be
ing distributed. There . are yet .a large
number of guns held by. the Samoans of
German Samoa, and Governor -, Solf has
issued orders requiring the delivery of, all
guns held by natives .to the Government
before the, end of the month. - , '

chief 3 of Tutuila for. a | donation of 1000
fine mats, a demand which would amount
to an extremely large sum. in the Samoan
idea, claims that his act' was not a politi
cal one, but on account of family relation
ship. Tho German Governor has called
Mata&fa to task over it and denies any.
cognizance of the. German authorities of
the action of Mataafa prior tq^the first
reports, which appeared to hinT through
the medium, of tne press. Governor Solf
has piohibited the turther use by Samo
ans of the terms "Tumua, Pule and
Alga," which embrace all Samoa.
The German Government has demanded
all taxes from property holders in arrears
prior to the annexation and covering the
period of the last war. The Germans have
received all the assets of the late Gov
ernor, including lands, buildings and cash,
but declined to pay acknowledged debts,
one of which Is a debt due to Seumanu
tafa by the late Governor for about 53000.
Nevertheless the Government has collect
ed taxes from Seumanutafa, which ac
crued prior to the hoisting of the German
flag. In reference to the appropriation
by Germany of all the assets of the'late
Government, the question is often asked,
"Why does not the United States step in
and demand her share?" That Govern
ment bhould be entitled to at least one
third of the assets. In Tutuila, under the
United States rule, business ', affairs are
booming.; The traders are doing more
than double their previous business and
the â¢ natives are contented and happy.
They are the envy of their cousins in tho
neighboring Islands.
The Government works, under Messrs.
Healy, Tlbbetts & Co., are progressing fa
vorably. Mr. Tibbetts has many difficul
ties to contend with, but has so far suc
ceeded In surmounting every, obstacle in
the work. Â¦
The natives of Fagatoga town, adjoin
ing the Government property, have agreed
to give up the whole of the beach front
and â¢ stretching several chains inland to
the Government for Government buildings
and/a reservation. With the money they
hope to get from the Government for the
concession they are going to build a hand
some church on the rising ground, a short
distance inland. They will also ship their
houses to the ground. The old church,
which Is on the reserve land. Is now be
ing used as a District Courthouse.. â¢ '
The proposed road around Pago Pago
harbor has been commenced under the su
pervision and direction of Chief B6at
swaln Hudson. U. S.'N., and as far'as It
goes docs credit;- There is much more v to
be done yet in roadmaking, but the treas
ury will not permit of the full completion
at the present time. .
The new light at Breaker Point has been
fixed and so are the leading of range

steamship Abarenda is still in New Zea
land and Lieutenant Commander E. J.
Dorn is still in command of the- station.
Lieutenant Dorn paid a visit .to the west
ern district and was well received by the
chiefs. They tendered to him and Mrs.
Dorn a talolo. During his visit several
important native disputes were settled.
The British and American residents of
German-Samoa are gradually Jeaving tho
country.
The Samoan Weekly Herald has been
sold to a company of Germans. It is be
lieved that the Governor has an interest
in the purchase. The late proprietor and
editor. Mr. King, has gone to New Zea
land.
D. S. Parker, the wealthiest citizen of
the- United States livlne in Samoa, is set
tling up his business affairs. . , . 'Â¦ . .
The residence of Mrs. E. W. Gurr has
been leased . to. Governor Solf for a long
term of years, and Mrs. Gurr and family
will leave Upolu for Tutuila.
The trade of German-Samoa is gradually
being merged Into that of the D. H. and
F. G. Company of Hamburg, and many
of the smaller traders of German na
tionality are complaining. The value of
land has not increased and property is
now being sold at prices lower than those
which could have been realized prior to
annexation.

Special- Dispatch to The Call
HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. 12.â It looks
like either 'a Quay victory or another bit
ter deadlock.- The lines are rapidly draw
ing-tense for the impending struggle be
tween former Senator II. S. .Quay and his
traditional enemies, the Republican "In
surgents" of Pennsylvania.
The ballots for United States Senator
are to be cast In , the separate houses of
the Legislature 'next , Tuesday, and for
Wednesday is scheduled the first ballot to
be taken by the Senate and House in joint
assembly. :. To a careful observer the situ
ation, almost on the eve of actual ballot
ing, is not unlike that which marked the
historic \ and desperate struggle of two
years agoâ a struggle that resulted in a
protracted' deadlock in the Legislature
and .in'.t.Quay's final repudiation by the
United . States Senate when he went to
that -body as a recess appointee bearing
the " certificate of his friend, Governor
Stone.
â¢ In the. ranks of the "insurgents is
noted the' same desperate determination
that, come what may. Quay's defeat must
now be made sure and decisive. Among
them, the feeling 1 prevails that the veteran
of practical -politics is making his last
fight â that he has staked everything 1 on
the result. "With defeat this year the "in
surgents" believe the battle-scarred lead
er of Pennsylvania's regulars must retire
from public life.
Among the Democrats, -who constitute
the third party in this triangular struggle,
there Is again, as two years ago, the same
disposition to decline to fuse with either
faction of the Republican adversaries.
Threats of eternal disgrace and everlast
ing political perdition are held above the
heads of the Democratic brethren about
whom hangs the odor of the smoke of
suspicion. â¢

ADVERTISEMENTS.
NOT DUE TO CLIMATE.
Catarrh Is Found Everywhere.
Catarrh Is at home anywhere and every-
where. While more common in cold,
changeable climates, it is by no means
confined to them, but is prevalent In every
State and Territory in the Union.
The common definition of catarrh Is a
chronic cold in the head, which If long
neglected often destroys the sense of smell
and hearing; but there are many other
forms of the disease, even more obstinate
and dangerous.
Catarrh of the throat and bronchial
tubes as well as catarrh of the stomach
and liver are almost as common as nasal
catarrh and generally more difficult to
cure.
Catarrh Is undoubtedly a blood disease
and can only be successfully eradicated
by an internal treatment. Sprays, washes
,and powders are useless as far as reach-
ing the real seat of the disease is con-
cerned. ' - .
Dr. Mclverney advises catarrh sufferers
to use a new preparation. Bold by drug-
gists, called Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, be-
cause actual analysis has shown these
tablets to contain certain antiseptic qual-
ities of the highest value, and being an
Internal remedy, pleasant to the taste,
convenient and harmless, can be used as
freely as required, as well for children as
for adults. -
An attorney and public speaker, who
had been a catarrh sufferer for years,
says:
"Every fall I would catch a cold, which
would settle ln my head and throat and
hang on all winter long, and every winter
Jt seemed to get a little worse. I was con-
tinually clearing my throat and my voice
became affected to such an extent as to
Interfere with my public speaking.
"I tried troches and cheap cough cures
and sometimes' got relief, but only for a
short time, until this winter, when I
learned of the new catarrh cure, Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, through a newspaper ad-
vertisement. Two fifty-cent boxes which
I bought at my druggist's cleared my head
and throat In fine shape, and to guard
against a return of my old trouble I keep
a box of the tablets on hand, and when-
ever I catch a llttlo cold I take a tablet
or two and ward oft any .serious develop-
ment?."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets deserve to head
the list as a household remedy to check
and break up coughs and colds, because
unlike many other catarrh and cough
cures, these tablets contain no opiate,,
cocaine "or nnv lninrinus drtie.

On the way south a storm was met
within, fifty miles of Queen Charlotte
Sound: Three Skaguay bound steamships
were passed lying In Â¦ safe anchorage be
fore the New England attempted to cross
through. The weather was exceedingly
heavy, and after an hour's battling with
the waves the steamship was compelled
to turn back 'and seek shelter In Safety
Cove.- Next morning she tried to cross the
sound again, and the. * second time * was
compelled. to lie to for a. whole day wait

; VANCOUVER. Jan. 12.â With her decks
covered -with a foot of ice and her rigging
looking like an Arctic. I ceberjr. the steam
ship New England, the largest ' fishing
boat In the world, completed, her trip
from the north to-day. She had what her
officers say was the roughest voyage
since, she commenced the fishing' business
. two j and a half years ago. . Frank John
son, a fisherman, was . so badly frozen
that he .will; be compelled to remain in a
hospital for; some .time. .
The coldest weather was experienced on
the -way north to the Â¦. Queen Charlotte
Islands, . oft the eastern coast of which
halibut are caught, to be shipped to the
Eastern markets. Johnson was on . the
forward deck and had to climb into the
rigging to prevent. being swept overboard
by the tremendous seas that washed from
end to end of the vessel. He was obliged
to remain in. that position for an hour,
and, when taken below his hands and feet

Captain Hughes says that the Tillamook
was doing better than nine knots an hour
when she brought up on the. reef, where
she was lurched and jerked about until
she. tore several holes in her bottom, also
badly breaking her sides and frames. He
and both the pilots were upon the bridge
when she struck and had, as- they sup
posed, a clear entrance to the harbor of
Kadiak. The vessel is a total loss and
she lies within a few miles of the wreck
of the old steamer Woleott. which went
topieces on a plmHar reef two years ago.
The Tillamook, which was owned in
San Francisco, sailed from Seattle on Oc
tober 20. beginning her run under a char
ter to the Alaska- Mall Steamship . Com
pany from Juneau. November 6. She pro-'
cecded to Unalaska and was returning
when overtaken by disaster.
The Alohja, In returning frcm TTnalaska
to th-i rescue of the Tlllamook's ship
wrecked passengers and crew, also got
on the. rocks. She brought up on Sand
Point reef, to the west of Unga, tearing
away nearly all of her keel. She sprang
a leak, . but manaeed to" keep .free or wa
ter by the constant use of the pumps. She
is 'returning to this port from Juneau.
Among the shipwrecked passengers
were:. N. Gray, of the Alaska Commercial
Compony;. Mrs. H. M. Hughes," of San
Francisco: Mrs. Lyall and Miss Emily
Lyall.wife and daughter of Mr. Robert
Lyall, surgeon ' of the -Apollo mine at
Unga. The full list is not obtainable, as It
is in possession of the purser, who Is
aboard the Aloha. . . .
SEATTLE, Jan. 12.â The steamer. Tilla
mook, United States mall carrler.-between
Juneau and Dutch Harbor, was wrecked
on November 27 on Wood Island reef, off
Kadiak, Alaska. Her passengers and
crew, numbering thirty" all told, made
thejr way. to Kadiak, five miles distant,
in the vessel's lifeboats. Captain Hughes,
commander of the Tillamook,- remained by
her for ' six days, Â¦ when he left the
ship to her fate, going to Kadiak, where
he joined the shipwrecked, all of whom
were rescued December 27, a month sub
sequent, by the. steam schooner Aloha,
bound from Unalaska to Juneau. The
passengers and crew were taken to Ju^
neau, there embarking on the steamer
Senator, which arrived in this port at
noon to-day.

class mail matter and other questions af
fecting mail facilities and expenditures
for two years and a half, held its final ses
sion to-day and will present its report to
Congress on Monday.
The report will not be unanimous and
there will be several dissenting opinions
on different points. Regarding the main
question, that of the cost of railroad mail
transportation, the conclusion of the com
mittee is that, under the present system
the charge -Is not excessive.- This con
clusion is concurred In by all the mem
bers of the committee, save Representa
tive Moody, of Massachusetts and Repre
sentative Catchings of -Mississippi. The
latter believes 'and- will so-state In a sepa
rate report that certain economies could
be effected on, the roads running through
regions of dense population, and they will
recommend that; a committee of the
House, to consist of an official of the
Postofuce Department. Professor Adams,
who acted as the committee's expert, be
appointed to carry .out the suggestions.
They estimate that r the enforcement of
their suggestions would save the Govern
ment $3,000,000 annually. -
The committee is unanimous, it Is un
derstood, that an extension of the pneu
matic, tube system -is impracticable and
Inadvisable. Upon the question of sec
ond-class mall matter, although the com
mittee concurs. . In the opinion .that the
piesent classification is Inequitable, no
specific recommendation is- made, as it Is
stated that Congress Is already thoroughly
familiar with the Issue involved. Regard.-
Ing the matter, of special railroad -facili
ties, the committee,- with the exception of
Senator Martin of. Virginia. and Represen
tative ;Catchings of Mississippi, oencurs
in the opinion that such expenditures are
not Justified. : . ;\ ..:â¢:;: -

California Commission. I did not visit
the State headquarters while I was in
Paris, and consequently know nothing. of
what went on there.
"The act" appropriating $130,000 for an
exhibition of California products, meant
the exhibition of products of California,
not the establishment of a homo for en
tertainment or the dispensation of hos
pitality nor to give dinners to the com
missioners cf other countries, nor to cele
brate the Fourth of July nor the observ
ance of Admission day. but for the instal
lation, maintenance and exhibiting of
products of the State.
"There is only one more statement to
which I care to give any attention,' and
if 1 had consulted my I- would
not have given any of them attention.
The statement to which I refor Is the
charge that I sent back from Paris denun
ciations of the commission. This, is Just
as mendacious as any other statement
that has been made. There were somt!
letters from Paris published which were
attributed to me. but I was not the author
of them. All this is easy of demonstra
tion. If any newspaper publisher in Cali
fornia has published anything denuncia
tory' of the California commission which
he obtained from me. he Is at full liberty
to make the .statement publicjy. No such
publisher can be found. I wrote but three
letters from ..Paris which were published,
and each v.as published over my signa
ture.
"Nothing has been done by me at any
time which was caDable of any distortion
into an act of unfriendliness toward the
commission during the time of the collec
tion of the exhibit, or its installation and
exposition at Paris. It has been and con
tinues to be a matter of sincere regret on
my part that misunderstanding of any
r.ature should have arisen In the prem
ises. I am completely conscious that such
misunderstanding- is not attributable to
any faction of mine, any more than that
the proposed investigation of the Pans

WEST POINT. Jan. 12.â When the Con
gressional investigating committee to-day
resumed Its probing process into hazing
at the military academy, there wns an un
usually large gathering of spectators . In
the examination room. The first witness
called to-day was Colonel A.' L. Mills, su
perintejident of the academy. The witness
said' that' he graduated from West Poln*.
In June, 1879.. During his experience as a
cadet, he said, fourth class men were re
quired to be obedient j and respectful to
the upper class men, but not in the same
measure which they would be obliged to
lecognize the authority of an academy of
ficer. The same demerit system which,
now exists .was then in vogue.
"Did they have class scrapping commit
tees then?" asked Judge Smith.
"They did- not." j Â¦
"Did they have fist fights to a finish,
with referees, seconds and time-keepers?"'
"Not that I can recall. I think thete
were only three fights during my academic
term. . These : were of an impromptu na
ture and I think the contestants were all
first class men."
Judge Smith . then asked a number o'
questions beaVlng on the surveillance o'
the movements of cadets at night and
elicited the information that no officer is
supposed , to be awake all night in order
to see that the cadets don't get outside
of the post reservation.
General Dick asked the witness many
questions bearing on the summary expul
sion from the academy of former Cadets
Bender and Lane in February, 1S99. Th2
men had been guilty of breaking into th.*
executive building, where they falsified
the records of demerits. They took off de
merits from the records of thirteen cadets,
including their own, but did not add ue
merits to the records of any others. Lane
confessed his part in the affair and also
owned up to his having assisted In burg
larizing, the cadet commissary. This con
fession was made to Superintendent Mill 4,
who dismissed the men at once.
Judge Smith then asked the superintend
ent about the action of the authorities to
suppress fighting or to punish those per
sons who took part in these affairs. Colo
nel Mills said that, despite the vigilance
of the academic authorities, these fights
were kept solely within the knowledge of
the cadets themselves. He said that only
two fights had come to his knowledge and
they were made known through the fact
that the cadets had to go to the hospital.
Colonel Mills told, the committee that
cadets who had been fighting did > not
usually show Â¦ marks of punishment that
might attract the attention of the officers.
Colonel 'Mills said he believed fighting
would cease In the academy and he 'felt
the best method of abolishing fighting and
hazing would be the creation of a senti
rrent among the cadets against such prac
tices, and he stated that he was striving
to stir up such a sentiment.
The superintendent' informed the com
mittee that up to about a year ago there
was great difficulty in securing evidence
from men who were hazed, as the regula
tions made hazers and hazed subject to
punishment. As the regulations had been
revised so that it is no longer a punish
able offense to be hazed the colonel said
that the fourth class men could now com
plain * without Incriminating themselves.
This In a great measure, he said, would
tend to make. the fourth class men resist
any attempts at hazing. . .
The witness then stated that there was
a decided change for the better in regard
to the exercising during last summer's
encampment.
"What would you think of a scheme of
administering an oath against hazing to a
cadet when he gets- his appointment?"
asked Mr. Drlggs. . ;
"I should not think it wlse.Â« There Is a
difficulty- in defining hazing., Chafflngand
quizzing new cadets is not hazing," replied
the colonel.
In reply to another question the wit
ness said:
"While I do not regard fighting, at -the
academy as a trifling affair. I do not think
it would be wise to change the existing
rule."
Mr. Drlggs said: "I have heard it said
In several parts of the country that fight
ing is traditional at West Point. Now/ 1
want to ask, is it true that you "West
Point officers are so imbued with the tra
ditions of fighting that you don't care to
have it stopped?"
"That is certainly not true." replied the
witness with some feeling, "and the offi
cers of the academy are the ones who
want to Tiut.it down. Fighting Is not
traditional here." I am strongly opposed
"Is It not cowardly on the part of upper
class men to call out fourth class men to
fight aealnst m<m who have better phy
sical* advantage?" i
"Yes, I think It is wrong, and to a cer
tain extent, cowardly," was the reply.
Colonel -Mills was questioned as to thÂ©
dlrmissalof Cadet Huetzler. . â¢
Colonel Clayton said Huetzler had been
reported forty-one times by officers and on
these reports ' he - received sixty-five de
merits, and on seventy-six reports from
cadets he received 152 demerits, making
in all 219 demerits. Colonel Mills, when
asked if he had ever found cadet officers
to be partial in their reports, said he
never In his career as superintendent had
a suspicion; of a cadet . officer having
abused. his authority. . .
Chairman Dick said the number of de
merits-given Huetzler on reports ;of ca
dets, 152. as against sixty-five from offi
cers, seemed so greatly out of proportion
to the other cases on the list that he
thought It needed some explanation. "

COLONEL MILLS
TELLS OF FIGHTS
W. H. Mills vigorously denies having
instigated the proposed legislative investi
gation cf the acts of the California Paris
Commission. He. resents the imputation
that he Is disgruntled because he was not
appointed a member of the commission
and is taking this means to be revenged
on those who were made the recipients of
the Governor's favor when the appoint
ments were distributed. Moreover he is
so well satisfied with the two exhibitions
of California products which he as the
representative of the Southern Pacific
Company collected. Installed and presided
over at Paris that he has no time to nour
ish hard feelings toward t.iose who spent
f=o much of the State's money in putting
up what he terms an inferior exhibition.
Mr. Mills opens up on his accusers with
the assertion, that the act of the Legisla
ture appropriating $130,000 for an exhibit
of California products at Paris was un
constitutional, and quotes the law on the
subject to back him up.
Mr. Mills protests that he has not seen
nor communicated with Grove L. Johnson
for more than a year, and that he has
never mentioned the subject of an Investi
gation or referred to the commission In
any way in any conversation he has had
with W. S. Melick. He says he has no
idea who suggested the investigation, but
he is aware that the Chamber of Com
merce of Los Angeles was very much dis
satisfied with the distributive exhibit
made by the State at Paris, and suggests
that possibly that body may have had
something to do with bringing the matter
before the Legislature. Incidentally Mr.
Mills admits that the Lcs Angeles Cham
ber of Commerce supplied him with all
the materials for his Southern California
exhibit.
"The statement that I have Instigated
this investigation to be revenged upon
members of the commission, or at all. is
as false as It Is absurd," said Mr. Mil's
yesterday. "I have no animus against th':
commission either as individuals or as a
body. In the first place the statement
that I was disappointed in not being ap
pointed a Paris Commissioner Is untrue.
At that time when I had every reason tÂ«
believe the Governor would appoint me, 1
telegraphed withdrawing my name from
further 'consideration with the otflce, an-1
I did this through conviction thnt unless
California's resources could be presented
either in a separate pavilion or in a de
partment which would admit of a cumu
lative exposition, the money would be
s.pcnt in vain. I so stated to interviewers
at the time, and the result has completely
vindicated that statement. 1 was askt <]
at that time what disposition I would
make of the appropriation, and I said that
in my opinion it should be returned to the
treasury of the State. I am giad to see
now that to the extent of $14,000 my advice
was taken and the only regret I feel is
that the entire sum did not return to the
treasury.
"I have held from the first that the act
appropriating $130,000 for a State exhibi
tion at the Paris Exposition was unconsti
tutional. . The constitution provides that
no money shall be appropriated for the
support of a State institution that is not
under the exclusive control of the State.
The exhibit was not under the control of
the State. The State simply contributed
to the United States exhibit and every
thing was under the direct supervi
sion of Commissioner General Peck, who
in turn was bound by the rules laid down
by the French Government. There was
no 'State' exhibition at Paris and the only
way you could tell an article was from
California was by looking at the label on
it. The Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce was verv much dissatisfied with the
distributive exhibit.
"The statement that I organized an
other exhibition to defeat the State ex
hibition is untrue. The State exhibit coul.l
! not possibly be defeated, and, moreover,
the suggestion for the exhibits made by
the Southern Pacific 1id not come from
me, but from C. P. Iluntington. and the
arrangements were made under the direc
tion of George Crocker. Neither Mr.
Huntingdon. Mr. Crocker nor myself en
tertained any ill will toward the Califor
nia commission, nor diJ the idea of mak
ing an exhibition by the Southern Pacific
Company originate In any desire to ob
struct or diminish In any way the value
: of the exhibit which the Commissioners
would make on behalf of this State.
"The Southern Pacific Company madÂ«
tvro exhibits in Paris at its own expense,
equally for the benefit of the State and
of the company. The most conspicuous
and monumental misrepresentation in
1 connection with this proposed Investiga
tion Is compressed In the statement that
1 the Southern Pacific Company's exhibit
in the pavilion erected by itself within the
grounds of the exposition was there . fay
the magnanimity of the Commissioners.
"The Commissioners, except Commia
eioner Foote, used every endeavor to pre

cific Company's exhibit In the pavilion.
Commissioner Runyou and Commissioner
Truman, accompanied by Secretary Gas
kill visited the office of the Commissioner
General and entered first a verbal pro
test against any exnloit from California
Inside of the exposition grounds; and
subsequently entered a written protest.
: I hold a letter from Commissioner General
i Peck In which the statement Is made that
! the California Commissioners had protest
ed aeainst the installation of 6ur exhibit
In the pavilion. They also filed a protest
with the French Government.
"I appeared alone before Peck, and he
told me that he sympathized with the
Commissioners, because he had told them
that they could not make a collective ex
hibit in the prounds. But ne allowed roe
to stay. I saw a letter In the hands of
the French authorities from Gaskill de
claring that the commission was authorr
ized to make an exhibition and protesting
apitinpt an exhibition by the Southern Pa
cific Company. While I regretted the
whole controversy, it was a good adver
tisement for the exhibit itself. I- had
some correspondence with the Governor
while we were endeavoring: to set the ex
hibit installed, and I took pains to inform
him that the letters werÂ« not confidential.
I can produce these letters if; desired.

WILL WOMEN'S RIGHTS BRING
HAPPINESS?
Helen Marvin Thinks Not, and
Points Out to Hor Sex the Mis-
takes It h Making.
At some time or other all of my read-
ers must have attended a woman's
lights meeting, and many of you per-
haps are interested In the movement.
Well, I went to such a meeting recent-
ly. I heard a lot of talk about down-
trodden women, about how they were
able and willing to support themselves
in the same field with men, and a great
deal more in the same vein. Women
Â¦were urged to fight for the right to
vote. Women to be looked upon as
man's equal by the law, women as
property holders, women on school
matters â all these things were dls-
cusscd. DIsrontent for the prestnt con-
dition of affairs was expressed in every
epeech.
I left the meeting, saddened. True,
the lot of women of the present day is
r.ot what it should be. They are un-
bappy. dissatisfied.
But will equarrights with men brins
them happiness? Will it make- them
more contented?
I fear not. History does not show it.
The women of two or three generations
back were contented -and happy. There
were few 511-mated marriages, few di-
vorces. Yet women never thought of
having equal rights with men. They
were willing to be the sex to 'honor
and obey." Women were worshiped by
men as something holy. Men did not
dream of asking them to take care of
themselves. Their mission In life was
not to support themselves, but to be
true wives and good mothers.
On the other hand, many of the wo-
men of to-day are totally unwilling to
fulfill their conjugal duties, or to de-
vote themselves to the rearing of chil-
dren. They spend their time, rather, in
a, jealous guarding of their rights in
the "position of the wife," and in forc-
ing individual and state alike to reeos-
r.5zo thTir equality with man.
Why is it that we cannot feel as our
grandmothers did? Why all this guard-
ing of our rights? The fact of the mat-
ter is. the trouble lies in our physical
rather than our social condition. Our
grandmothers were strong, healthy wo-
men, well able to attend to the duties
nature assigned to them. We for the
most part are broken in nerves, many
cf us Fuffering from some female dis-
order that quite unfits a woman to be a
wife in more than name. So the bonds
which held the family together and
pave a woman her rights through love
r.o longer exist In many, many cases,
and she must now demand and insist
before she gets what she considers her
due.
I have known so many young people
who married and for a time were a3
happy as two doves. The rights of wo-
men did not trouble the wife. She was
content with the gifts of affection
showered upon her by her husband.
But by and by clouds arise. Sometimes
there is a child, sometimes two. The
mother is not strong enough to care
for them. Her relatives come to her
help, but even then she hasn't time to
devote to the husband she has promised
to love until death. He finds his way
to clubs, to matters of other interest-
Business occupies much of the time
that would under more pleasant cir-
cumstances have been spent at home.
Then the woman feels herself neglect-
ed, the care of the children is turned
over to nurses, she goes to women's
clubs and demands of the state equal
rights with men. But Is it these rights
Ehe wants? Is it not rather the rights
of the wife, the rights she willingly re-
linquished when she allowed herself to

wifely duties?
It seems to me, therefore, that any
woman who feels herself unfairly
treated, who does not believe that the
has the lights to which she is entitled,
fhou'.i look for the trouble in herself.
Discontent and unhappiness often are
the result of nervousness. Nervousness
can always be traced to female trouble.
I do wish that every woman who feels
dissatisfied with her lot would realize
that she Is sick, and would take steps
to make herself well. If your back
aches continually, bo that you feel as
though you no longer could stand it,
don't let the pain continue. Take Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,
and it will cure you. If you have pain

Mrs. Pinkham's medicine will make a

her husband, and once more will tlrey
realize the Joys of home. The children
when they come will be a blessing, a

the demands for women's rights no

/ The Boston Transcript recently contained an advertisement to this effect: "A neat young

IT IS evident that Mr. Martin Kelly does not make a nucleus for his health. His Speaker of
the 'House has made a strictly nucleus organization of that body.
Passing over experience and fitness for legislation, Speaker Pendleton introduced a new
method into legislative organization by confining his committee chairmanships closely to the mem
bers of the nucleus, and then he took pains to put a majority of the nucleus on important commit
â¢ tees. He has, in< other words, ignored the fact that the majority of the House is Republican, and
has made a new alignment, dividing the membership into the Nucleus and the Republican parties.
He treats the Republicans as a minority, the Nucleus as a majority party.
It will be observed that the nucleus is organized for "biz," as the push would say. The
committees which will handle measures- that have juice in them or that will have the power to pro
tect malfeasance in public trusts are allmade up for a purpose.
The Republicans of the State will feel the situation keenly, because they supposed they had
a majority in the House. To be so suddenly turned into a minority by that eminent political magi
cian, Martin Kelly, is enough to give" a Republican "the verrhes." ,

WHILE Marconi holds the leading- place in the ranks of those who are fast making wire
less telegraphy a formidable rival to the existing system, he is by no means the only exper
imenter in the field who has achieved notable successes. In every civilized country able
electricians are working at the problems, and in several instances have accomplished marvels
hardly less important than those of Marconi himself.
â¢An illustration of what is being done in Germany in the way of wireless telegraphy was re
cently given by the Berlin, correspondent of the London Post. He describes a lectureahd experi
ments made by Professor Slaby before the Emperor, at which it was demonstrated that it is pos
sible to work several corresponding stations simultaneously by producing electric waves of vari
ous lengths and sending them through a transmitter invented by the professor.
In describing the invention the report says: "A receiving instrument adjusted to the size
of these waves will receive no other waves, all waves of a different size attracted to the receiving
wire being- 'filtered' through it to the ground. In order to prevent the weakening of emitted
waves by buildings, chimneys and other obstacles, Professor Slaby employs a multiplicatbr of his
own invention, which strengthens the tension of the waves in an extraordinary way. Professor
Slaby employed two receiving instruments, connected with the lightning conductor of the lecture
hall. Two stations, one four and the other fourteen kilometers distant, were then called, and in
a few seconds the lively telegraphic correspondence was. proceeding, the two instruments working
, It will be seen that the problems which perplex one inventor are being solved bv another, f
and the development of the new telegraphy is- progressing rapidly. It is almost time to begin
speaking of this as "the wireless century." .
NEW "WIRELESS" SUCCESS.
We have no statistics at hand to show what increase may be expected annually in the issue
of articles of incorporation and in the probating of estates. In each case it may be assumed that
the increase will run with the accretion of population. But already the attendance at the uni
versity bears a larger proportion to the population than in many Eastern States. Therefore it may
be expected that the percentage of increase in attendance will still keep ahead of the percentage of
increase in the population.
So the Legislature need have no fear of being overgenerous to the university. It will need
all legitimate addition to its income, and all that private* wealth may be.moveji to bestow.
The measures proposed by the Council of, Alumni are expected to yield an increase of
$100,000 per annum, and every dollar of it is immediately required. In view of the: constant and
rapid increase in the student enrollment, and therefore in the work required, this sum might be
made larger. As the increase in the past has overtaken and passed the possibilities of the revenue,
there is a certainty that the future enrollment will overtake this enhanced income.
Not only every graduate but every citizen should urge prompt legislative, action, to the end
that the State may escape the disgrace of an indigent university, pinched and starving like a poor
country schoolmaster. â¢
The enormous increase in attendance, reaching nearly 400 per cent in ten years, is evidence
of popular appreciation' of the university. Let the concurrent increase of only 70 per cent in its
income admonish the Legislature and the people that it is likely r,to die of popular appreciation un
less its strength be increased to an equality W-ith its burden. . /
The people are clear sighted to the relation between the university and their materialities.
Should its proper support fail, the State would be inestimably weakened, and every Californian
who goes beyond our borders would hang his head with a sense of inferiority.
We do not know of anything more injurious to the State than the crippling of the univer
sity. It would carrj'- our discredit far abroad and unfavorably affect every interest of our people.
In adding to its income the State will be putting more value into every acre of land and
more profit into every business operation in California.
The growth of the university has been so sudden, dating from the foundation of Stanford,
which acted as. a great impulse upon the older schools, that the people li^ye riot appreciated it: It
should be known that only by the most niggardly economy has the university, been kept open this
year, and next year a repetition of this economy will be quite impossible.
. â . _ Â¦ .
IT IS hoped that the Legislature will promptly respond to the necessities of the university. The
enlargement of its revenues by the fees for issuing^articles of 'incorporation and an inheritance
tax is a plan that lias the advantage of beginning to yield revenue at once, while an ordinary
tax, made a part of the regular levy, will bring nothing in until taxes are paid, or, a year or more
from the date of the law. ; ' . Â£Â¦*
The people should know that unless something. is done to enlarge, significantly, the in
come of the institution, a large part of its work must cease, or depend upon private benefaction for
its continuance. , .
NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY.
A.MONG the Imminent musical possi
bilities the "touch-the-button" or
ganist Is perhaps most Interesting,
as he will be most far reaching In
effect. The application of the aeol
-" Ian principle to church organs, all
but completed now by a company of or
gan builders of Chicago, on the face of it
seems destined to revolutionize this Im
portant branch of the musical art.
According to account, a standard reper
tory of church music can be furnished in
aeollan rolls at the small expense of two
or three hundred dollars. A knowledge
of registration, the ability to change the
rolls and make requisite variations in
tempos will constitute all the musical cap
ital required by the future church organ
istâor aeolianlstâ as he shall be more
properly called. W. S. B. Matthews, in
the current number of Music, Indulges In
some amusing speculation concerning the
possibilities of the Invention. "Organ re
citals by the janitor." tne combination
minister-organist, with a button attach
ment in the pulpit, are counted In among
the possibilities. '
Mr. , Matthews In tho same article also
ventilates some distinctly disrespectful
views concerning the "king of Instru
ments," Incidental to a criticism of a re
cent Clarence Eddy recital. Mr. Mat
thews apparently has no love for the or
gan,' neither for the particular organist,
which latter expression of opinion to some
of us who had the audacity to crltlclz?
the muchly advertised musician's per
formance on the occasion of his last re
citals here Is no unwelcome hearing. As
to the organ. Its limitations, admittedly
extraordinary, and its capabilities, sub
mittedly also extraordinary, Mr. Mat
thews will find fewer people to agree with
him.
Only "less bad" than another Is any
organ recital, however good, according to
Mr. Matthews, and necessarily so on ac
count of the Incapabilities of the instru
ment. "Do people really like organ re
citals? If so. why?" he asks. Only as
an accompaniment to conversation of the
bridal apd funereal sort, he submits. Is
the instrument at all tolerable. Not even
Is the Bach music grateful to him. but
everything else Is completely outside the
pale of artistic consideration. Mr. Eddy's
programme contained but one Bach num
ber, the remainder of the programme con
sisting of trivial movements, "neither fit
ted to exhibit the Instrument to advan
tage nor to display any special art of
technique that might be possessed by the
player"â all of which hath a painful sound
as one remembers the Eddy programmes
In San Francisco.
â¢ . â¢ â¢
In defiance of Mr. Matthews' diatribe,
I must own to a liking for the organ re
cital, and also acknowledge a hearty re
gret at being so seldom afforded oppor
tunity to Indulge the liking in San Fran
cisco. With the exception of Dr. H. J.
Stewart, who has done yeoman service In
this direction with his weekly half-hour
recitals at Trinity Church, and an occa
sional recital by Wallace A. Sabin, F. C.
O., few or none of the organists are heard
In aught save the regular church pro
grammes. Across the bay some eminently
good work has been done by Miss Vlr
glnle de Fremery and William B. King,
but any approach to the recitals which
draw their weekly, sometimes daily,
crowds in Eastern cities, has yet to be
made. There are noon-hour recitals for
working folk. Sunday afternoon recitals,
free recitals, 10-cent recitals, popular and
classical recitals, all kinds of recitals, on
this Instrument which, after the violin,
seems to touch most closely the popular
heart. We have the organs here, though
the town Is sadly lacking Â¦ in a concert
hall containing a good instrument, and we
have the orsranlsts. but of any further
than the before mentioned effort ! in the
direction of the recital I am so far un
aware. If any such exist, I shall be happy
to give space to the programmes In these
columns and to announce time and place
of recital.

A Russian name on a musical pro
gramme has; of late years, been almost a
synonymous term for something good, for
a composition of high worth and distinct
originality. The first hearing of the new
Afanasslefr string quartet, given by the
Minetti QtCartet on Friday evening last,
was a double disappointment therefore.
With the exception cf a mildly Interesting
slow movement, the composition is cheap,
commonplace; lacking In melody, a thing
of shreds and patches and meaningless,
forced effects. It, however, 1 acted as an
excellent foil for the beautiful Brahms
quintet, whose hearing was the event of
the evening. Eminently sane, dignified,
is this Brahms composition, full of noble
melody and" of rich harmonies.' It was
played with admirable spirit and enthu
siasm by the members of the quintet, but
the piano part dominated unpleasantly.
"With Mr. -Minettl. Otto Bendix. who was
the pianist of the evening, gave the C
minor Sonata of\ Beethoven, and here
again the piano was in unpleasant evi
dence. The part was overweighted, over
emphasized, overcolored. .There was no
balance between the parts, no sympathy
between the players; it was a piano solo,
with an unimportant obllgato . by the
violin. Mr. Bendix . showed much more
sympathy in the Brahms movement, but
he is, emphatically, a solol3t.
Another Russian quartet | is announced
for the next, concert on January 25, the
sixth and last, also a repetition (by re
quest) of the delightful "3ouvenir de
Florence" of Tschaikowsky. ''". T

Louis TV Gottschalk," a distinguished au
thority! on "i his'" subjects In 'â¢ a'' letter 1 to ' the
editor, appearing in the current number
of Music, makes the following pregnant
remarks, anent the familiar vocal vice,
the tremolo. He says:
"Tremolo of the voice Is a defect, and.
as such, has no excuse for its existence,
being the result of either one of the three
following causes: Diseased vocal organs,
old.asre or defective breathing. '
"If vocal studcnt3. and consequently
sirgers. would bear la mind the position
of the lungs In relation to the larynx,
they would possibly comprehend in a
quicker way that the glottis ia to be
hermetically sealed one instant before the
air furnished from the lungs (consequent
ly from below the larynx) strikes the vo
cal cords, which form the Inner edges o^
the glottis.
"I do not think it 13 an. exaggeration t3
say that two-thirds of the people suffer
ing from the tremolo bring it upon them
selves by the lack of firmness In attack
ing the note, thus allowing the air to fil
trate through the vocal cords before tha
glottis i3 hermetically closed.
"LOUIS F. GOTTSCIIALK.

Quite the latest echo of the recent
Grau season is the following, which, culled
from the New York Dramatic Mirror, also
charmingly proves that we have here no
"horrid monopoly" of the wild and woolly
rumor:
"A rumorâ interesting if trueâ says that
the recent tour to California of Mr. Gra " 9
grand opera company was madÂ© under
the financial backing of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company. This is a new
form of railway enterprise, and lnasmucn
as the allied companies are not just at
present showing marked consideration in
the matter of liberal terms for transporta
tion to theatrical organizations, it 13
cheering to note this individual instance
of reciprocity."
Another interesting vocal cutting 13
from the pages of Harpers Bazar, where
in Marchesl describes the usual happen
ings of a first singing lesson according
to Marches!: "You are frishtened, my
dear young lady!" she says. "Don't brt '
alarmed; you will get on very well, biand
upon the platform, please, and settle firm
ly on both feet: do not hang your head,
but keep it up naturally. Hold up your
head. I say. You stoop too much; put
your arms behind your back, so that the
chest may be free. Now. take breath.
No, not so! That was but a half-breath.
You must take a deep breath, and not ex
pel tho breath too rapidly. No, that will
'Â¦ not do. I will count. While taking
breath I shall 'count ten; while holding
It. five; while slowly expelling it, ten.
Good, very good! Now open your mouth.
Why that grinning imile? That gives tho
voix Llancheâ the white voice, the tone
striking the soft palate. Open your
mouth naturally; the lower Jaw must bo
depressed, as the upper jaw Is motionless.
Good. Now attack the tone by drawing
togethtr the vocal cords; take care that
when you attack it no air comes forth;
do not strike the tone so hard. That Is
an exaggerated coup de glotte, and sounds
harsh. Strike the tone once again. Thac
is right. Now let ua study the passage
from one register to another. Try to sins
the last tone of the chest-register as soft
ly as possible, so that the transition to
the middle register be imperceptible, and
do likewise in respect to the transition
from the middle to. the head reglsrer. It
is not to be expected in the beginning that
the registers be connected and made even,
but attention must be directed to that end.
which must eventually be attained
through practice. Sing for me first two,
then three, then four, then five tones.
Good! ThaX will suffice for to-day. Dur
ing the first month do not practice at
home, so that I may keep watch of your
breathing, your attack, and your passage
from, register to register; It Is Impossible
that. In a single lesson, you should com
prehend tho method, and through misdi
rected study you might undo all I have
taught you. Remain here, however, and
â¢follow the Instruction imparted to other
pupils; you will learn much thereby and
what is Ktrange to-day will become famil
iar, by listening, to-morrow. The first
hour's instruction is ended. You see, my
dear youns lady, It was not so very ter
rible. Now then, cheer up and do not

Here the interview was interrupted by
the arrival of the Udv who came to de
mand the part, and Miss Morris fled whilo
the storm raged.

If Mr. Daly's friends ceny the truth of
this story, they must shoulder the heavy
burden of attempting to prove universal
negative; if the story is true, what a hum
bug was the Greatest American Manager
âyet what a pity Miss Morris felt com
pelled to Fhnw him ud after instf-ad of be
fore his death. It would have been most
interesting to hear Mr. Daly's reply.
"He struck his hand angrily on the desk
before him. 'Miss Morris, when I give
an order '
â¢ * â¢ " 'Mr. Daly.' I said, 'won't you
please trust to my discretion? I don't
like lying even for my daily bread; but If
silence is golden, a discreet silence Is
away above rubies.'
" 'One woman to whom it belongs re
fuses the part," he said. "Another woman,
who can't play It. demands It from me
and I want to stop her mouth by making
her believe the part was given to you be
fore I knew her desire for it. Do you
see?'
Yet this very proper feeling may, as
De Qulncey has pointed out, be carried
too far: tenderness to the dead Is some
times cruel injustice to the living, who
surely have an equal claim to justice
with the dead. It must have been som<Â»
such counter-feeling as this which has
caused Miss Clara Morris, in the January
McClure's. to accuse the late Augusfn
Daly not only of being a liar himself but
âto put it plainlyâ of trying to bully her
into being a liar also. Her story runs
that at the first rehearsal of "Man and
Wife" she received the part of Blanche,
but before the second rehearsal received
from Mr. Daly tho more important part
of Anne. My Daly said:
" 'You will tell the people you were to
play Anne in the first place.*
" "But, Mr. Daly,' 1 cried, 'the whol*
company saw me receive the part of
Blanche.'
"He gnawed at the end of his mustache
in frowning thought.
"Concerning the dead, let us say noth

ed on the desire that every honorable
combatant has to give his antagonist a
fair chance; not to speak evil of Chose
who are not present to defend themselves,
and least of all to speak evil of those
whose absence must be eternal.
Mr. Gosse's article was written before
the production of Mr. Phillips' last play.
"Herod," at Her Majesty's Theater. In
the following lines the critic foreshadows
the exact fate that fell upon that un
lucky piece: "Our poor actors seem to

It seems almost vain for poets like Mr.
Phillips, who is a learned and accom
plished metricist. If he is anything, to give
our 'brave plush and velvet men' his
delicate verses to mangle."
After leaving Mr. Benson's company in
1S92 Mr. Phillips devoted himself to severe
study of poetical formsâ a study that
bore fruit in the beautiful fragment of
a Christlad published in 1S96. entitled
"Christ in Hades." This established hia
reputation, which was enhanced by "Mar
pessa and Other Poems" (1S9T) and by the
exquisite version of the "Paolo and Fran
cesca" story, published in 1S39.
distinguished as an actor, "there was one
part in which he really excelled, and odd
ly enough, it is one which. Shakespeare Is
known to have played, and -which .was
said to be 'the top of his performance'
This was the ghost in Hamlet, which Mr.
Phillips acted "with a dignity so awful
that he was positively called before the
curtainâ a distinction believed to be In
this role unparalleled."
THIS has been a week of what you
might call homespun drama and
fair drama at that. Of the two that
I have pe*nâ "Jed Prouty" and "Hu
man Hearts"â the former is the bet
ter as a character study, tho latter as a
dramatically told story- Mr. Golden has
certainly hit off the^Ncw England village
potentate to the life*, as any one who has
lived in a commonwealth established of
the Pilgrims may recognise. He Is more
over an excellent actor, making his points
with that apparent unconsciousness that
is the essence of comedy-effect. "Jed
Prouty" is as good a play as the "OM
Homestead" and Mr. Golden is as good an
actor as Denman Thompson. . If only he
would put his play on in better shape
there Is no reason why ho should not be

favorite of fortune. If it be any comfort
to him. one may offer him this consola

The New York Life is one of the very
few Journals in the metropolis that speaks
Us mind plainly â or. Indeed, has a mind tc
ppeak â on theatrical topics. Depending
little on its advertising and much on the
cleverness and independence of its writ
ers, it shows fear never and favor on.v
whrre favor is Cue. In a recent issue its
dramatic critic, after paying his respects
to what he calls "the degrading Influence
of the syndicate," adds these words of
truth and of hope:
"The end of the century finds Americans
the greatest theater-going people in the
Â¦world. That doesn't mean, though, that
Americans are, by. all means, the most
discerning patrons of the art dramatic.
Of all the millions lavished on the stagj
every year by our public the great mass is
expended on entertainments in which art
is a very minor consideration. In th!*
country by far the most Importantâprac
tically the soleâ function of the theater
is to amuse. The educational value of the
ftage is entirely neglected. What the
church is supposed to do for morals the
Ftage might very easily be made to do for
manners, were there some motive higher
than mere money making at the back of
the theatrical business. But when thj
question of the value of an actor rests
more on his salary than on his ability, wo
may not expect much in the way of artis â¢
tic demonstrations of the niceties of life.
"The new century is bound to bring us
a National Theater. The country is rich
enough ar.d the time is ripe. The Theatri
cal Syndicate has been of that much ser
vice to the artâ it has shown us that It
is not safe to trust fo great an educational
Influence to a purely mercenary interest.
There are enough sincere lovers of the
drama in America to make it sure that be
fore long we shall have a theater where
money making is not the supreme object.
6uch an enterprise is now under serious
consideration, and America may yet show
the Old World that the development of the
new hemisphere Is not entirely a material
one â that the art of money getting Is no'.
the only one encouraged here."
That Is indeed good newsâ not too good,
let us hope, to be true. New York needs
an endowed theater as badly as does San
Francisco and that is very badly indeed.
In the January Century Edmund
Gosse has a little biography of Stephen
Phillips, the young poet, whose tragedies,
"Paolo and Francesco," and "Herod,"
Eive- promise of raising him to a level
higher than that occupied by any other
living English poet.
Mr. Phillips was born in 1S6S and is con
nected, on his mother's Bide, with the
poet Wordsworth. He cared nothing for
poetry until he was 15; at that age his
mother happened to read "Chrlstabel" to
him and this determined his vocation, as
he thought. In 1886 he entered the Uni
versity of Cambridge, but he had been
there but a few months when Mr. Ben
son's troupe came a-Shakespearing
through the eastern counties and Mr.
Phillips must go with them. He stayed
with Mr. Benson six years. Though not

Governor Dole has received complete ad

sales made during that period, which bear j
the Fitrnature of President McKinley, ap- |
proving the transfers. '
Thin would mean that the Olaa squat- |
ters must be turned off the land they have

waiian Government in disposing' of the
land has been sustained, instead of having
been ordered attacked by the United

stated. It is claimed, however, that the
â¢attack Is to come and that those who j
have been attacking the action of the
Government in disposing: of the land con
tirue to insist that the President has not
given his approval and cannot do so. The
controversy arouses much Interest in

HONOLULU, Jnn. â¬.â A proposal to in
corporate a city nf Honolulu which shall
include the entire island of Oahu has been
made In a majority report of a sub-com
mittee to the Republican committee on
charter. The proposed city would be
larger Than London or any other city In !
the world. It would have an area of 2S4,- j
000 acres and would include several im- j
mense su?ar plantations, one of them, the I
Ewa plantation, being the most produc- J
tive in the territory. The population of ]
the city would be about â¬0,000. i
A city iLnii county government for the j
islard ie proposed, and those who advo- J
cate this j)!an of making a municipality I
of Honolulu think that taxes would be i
eaved and a better government would be !
provided if all the outside districts were i
included in Honolulu. The report in favor |
of this plar. was presented by J. B. Pratt, j
A. V. Gear and T. McCants Stewart, a !
majority of the committee. The peneral I
coa?.n:ittee is to discuss the subject at a i
future meeting and decide upon a charter j i
!f possible. In the meantime the Inde- ; !
pendents are working upon a charter and j j
Vtill probably put most of the provisions |
through the Legislature. They have not i j
yet decided upon the boundaries of the j >
city. l â¢
President George Q. Car.non of the Mor- , Â¦
men church, in an interview published ! !
here, calls attention to the decrease of ;
the Hawaiian population, and expresses
profound reeret at what he terms the j
â¢â¢pas-sinpr away" of the kanaka rat*. Can- i
run was here ril'ty years agn, when he ' !
started the Mermen church here, and he !
fays that in making inquiries about the !
notable o!d families he round that many j
of Them had died out. He thinks the na- .
tives should be separated from the out- j
iiJde world. i
"I would favor the natives being gath- ,
ered tofceth<=r and separated from the evil !
influences ni the outside world." save the i
head of the Mormon church: "they coulJ
be taupht a higher and better life."
President Cannon intimates that immor
ality is kliiing off the Hawaiian race, and
thai the mingling with the whites is re
sponsible for such conditions.
Mortuary statistics of the islands show
that .-Â» large infant death rate, rather than
ii err.a!l birth rate, is responsible for the
decreasing population of the Hawaiian
Islands. The proportion of deaths of
thepe und^r nve years of age to the whole
number of deaths in recent months has
l>e*n very great, beinp: SS out of 340 in five
months. It is claimed that the Hawaiian j
children are net properly cared for by
their parents. ]

EULOGIZE LATE
SEMATOR DAVIS
MANILA, Jan. 12.â The first public dis
cussion of the bill to establish a depart
ment of public ; instruction developed a
contest on the question of religion in pub
lic schools. Interest centers in the section
permitting priests and ministers to teach
religion for a half-hour three times week
ly outside of school hours, provided the
parents espres3 a written desire for such
instruction, and prohibiting teachers from
conducting religious exercises or teaching
religion. The direptors otr, the Federal
party were represented by i a -, committee,
who, although Catholics, argued strongly
in-favor of the elimination of the section.
Thoy Â¦ declared that the use- of school
houpes for religious purposes â¢ is contrary
to the United States constitution, and also
to the platforms of the American partjes
and the Philippine Federal party, -and is
certain to cause discord:.
Judge Taft said the- attitude of the
United States Philippine Commission as a
legislative power was one of absolute'in
difference between Catholic. Protestant or,
Mohammedan religions. Â¦< The Commiwion-

Commissioner Henry C. Ide asked which
course would satisfy the greater number
of people. â¢
Dr." Burgos in reply quoted the declara
tions of the Malolos, or Federal party, in
favor of the separation; of church ranu
state. Â¦Â¦' ..: Â¦ Â¦.-â¢Â¦â¢ '-. - : Â¦ .-.â¢Â¦-Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦'.â¢', 'Â¦Â¦'Â¦'- Â¦.Â¦:Â¦
judge Taft contended that it was impos
sible to Judge the/ new. system at hap
hazard or by the results of another sys
tem. He believed things would be accom
plished under the present laws . which
were impossible under the former regime:
He asked whether it was not impolitic to
take action which would unnecessarily
shock the feelings of the Catholic people.
The doctor replied that it was better to
eliminate now a section which was bad
and certain to create difficulties.
ers, he added, endeavored to ' frame the
act eo that the people's prejudices would
assist Instead of retard its success. V 1
The arguments on the sections of the
school bill allowing' religious teachings in
schools were continued to-day. Dr. Burgos
urged the commission to consider the ad
vantages it would give Catholicism on ac
count of the church's overwhelming pre
ponderance.
Judge Taft explained that this legisla
tion was experimental. If it became the
instrument of ecclesiastical opposition it
would be repealed.
Dr. Burgos replied that it ought to be
repealed now. The Filipinos, he said, had
had enough of the results of religious in
struction in the schools.

Strongly Objects to Pool-Selling Un
less Conducted Within Race-
Track Inclosures.
A special meeting of the board of diret
tors of the Merchants* Association wat
held yesterday in the rooms of the or
ganization in the Mills building. F. "W.
Dohrmann presided and the following di
rectors were present: A. S. Baldwin, C. S.
Benedict. Foster P. Cole, AV. P. Redlng
ton, Hugo Rothschild and Frank J.
Eymmes.
The directors unanimously approved tho
act introduced by Senator Belshaw pro
b'bitlng poolselling and bookmaking upon
contests or chances, except when con
ducted within race track Inclosures or fair
p-ounds. While the board did not desire
to give its approval to the selling of pools
or bookrnaking in any shape or form or in
any place whatever, it was deemed advis
able to urge the passage of this measure
es a practical remedy for the evil.
The directors also decided to favor the
act proposed by the California "Water and
Forest Association for united action with
the Federal Government in the storage of
the flood waters of the State and the
preservation of the forests.
The residents of the northern slope of
Bernal Heights are anything but well
pleased with the City Hall officials. The
cause of this dissatisfaction lies in the
fact that their "supposed" Holly Park has
been allowed to slumber in its virgin con
dition for years, notwithstanding the
yearly appropriations which the Super
visors have made for its improvement.
The park, which stands on the official
map, would, if improved, add much to the
comfort and beauty of that locality, yet
it is permitted to remain in its original
condition, while other public sqaures In

divided attention of the Board of Public

A joint session of the legislative com

of the Commercial School, San Francisco;

T. H. McCarthy of the Washington Gram
mar School; Deputy Superintendents W.
D. Kingsbury and L. A. Jordan, Sun
Francisco. The last named ! presided at
the meeting and P. M. Fisher was secre
tary. The result o{ the session was the
formulating: of a bill to amend the act
of 1S97 providing for the retirement of
teachers and the payment of annuities by
requiring boards of education to turn in
to the teachers' annuity fund at least one
half of the absence money or the differ
ence between a regular teacher's salary
and that of the substitute. This will
largely increase the annuities of teachers
who are retired. Deputy Kingsbury will
present the bill to tha legislative leaders

terial. For the uppers the finest Heyl's
patent and enamel calf is used in the
heavier and more mannish shapes for the
tailor-made woman, while selected chrome
kid is used for the more dainty dress
shoe. The "Ultra" is made in all of the
new shapes, rmbodylng the new and
graceful dress shoos and the sturdy walk
ing styles. They have welted soles and
are sewed with silk. For summer wear
they use the famous "Willow calf" for the
heavier tan shoes, and the tan chrome kid
for the lighter -weights. They are also
made in low shoes as well as boots, and
the fastenings are either in lace or but
ton. Throughout the East and Europe the
well dressed and sensible woman is found
to be wearing the Ultra shoes. The fact
that the East gives preference to the Ul
tra, should be sufficient guarantee for a
personal trial of its merit. Mr. H. Lesser,
proprietor of the Bee Hive Shoe Store, 717

Court sent his regrets at not being able to
Good-fellowship reigned during the ser
vice of the dinner. Supervisor Booth for
got about the danger of high fences to
quaff "extra dry" with Judge Joachimsen,
who wore his familiar skull cap. Colonei
Howell sat next to Chief of Police Sulli
van, hoping to set a few "pointers" on
how to run the police department. Jack
Casserly and Joe Tobin exchanged views
across the table as to the- latest doings
in society, while Judge ; Coffey acted as
mentor to Judge Kerrigan. " Health Officer
O'Brien looked â¢ happy - because Federal
Quarantine Officer Kinyoun v;as not in
vited to the feast, and Recorder God
chaux was delighted at the warmth of the
banquet room, which was very different
to his quarters in the Hall of Records.
The Civil Service Commissioners looked
excited, for a wag had told them, that
they would have to pass upon the merits
of all the speeches to be delivered later
on. . . .
An elegant repast was served from 7 to
9:30 p. m., music being discoursed during
the dinner by an orchestra. The tables
were decorated with American Beauty
roses and presented an artistic appear
ance.
"I am sure that you would rather listen
to the views of one disinterested citizen
than to the views of an Interested press
or the interested editors who sit in high
towers and whose mission is so exalted
that they cannot get down to the level of
the common people."
These were the words of Mayor Phelan
in which he took occasion to introduce
President Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association to the guests at the banquet.
That Mr. Dohrmann was annoyed at the
untimely and uncalled for remarks of tho
Mayor was shown by the expression on
his face when he rose to speak.
Mr. Dohrmann asked leave to read a
newspaper report of his recent address on
"Good Government," and when in firm
tones he said "Gentlemen, I am the friend
of the press" the heartiest applause of the
evening was heard.
One prominent city official was heard to
say, "Well, if the editors of the papers
cannot get down to the level of the com
mon people they have at least reached the
Mayor, so in reaching the common people
the press doesn't have to consider his
Honor."
With the exception of the jarring note
sounded by the Mayor the banquet was
a love feast in every respect. Many of
the city officials who were Invited to at
tend did not materialize. Only four gen
tlemen were present who were not in the
service of the city.
The invited guests aside from the city
officeholders were Collector of the Port
F. S. Stratton, General W. R. Shafter of
the United States army, President F. W.
Dohrmann of the Merchants' Association
and President J. Britton of the Board of
Freeholders.
The tables were arranged in the shape
of the letter "T," Mayor Phelan sitting at
the head and his immediate neighbors be
ins Collector Stratton, General Shafter,
Mr. Dohrmann. Mr. Britton, Auditor
Wells, Judge Sloss and City Attorney F.
K. Lane. The rest of the guests were
seated in two long rows stretching from
the main table.
Many good speeches and a few indif
ferent ones were presented at the munici
pal feast last night, but the' only one
which can be characterized as being in
bad taste came from the host of the even
ing.
Mayor Phelan does . not seem to have
gained any new ideas in the art of speak
ing at public banquets. At the dinner
which he tendered last evening in the
Maple room of j the Palace Hotel to the
city officials the chief executive showed
that he had reread the speech he made a
year ago on a similar occasion by .making
an attack on the proprietors and editors
of the San Francisco papers.
. Â«That. was the platform upon which thÂ« char
ter wag elected, and speaking for, those I repre
oent, and speaking for those I do not represent,

FVW.' Dohrmann; president of the .Mer
chants' Association, delivered one of the
best speeches' of * the evening. â¢ > He ' dis
cussed at length the efforts of the city to
frame a charter.' -He told of the good the
charter had done for the municipality, 1 and
in concluding his able speech; he said: :
As Auditor of the city I can say there has
been a great" Improvement in the city govern
ment. . I believe that the law under which we
are acting now is an . Improvement and ; is" a
benefit to every department in the, city. The
employes throughout the City Hall are work-

â¢ Auditor Wells expressed his surprise at
being called upon to make a speech,. but
being in it he made the most of the bar
gain. In part, he said: ;
. Joseph" Tobln' was called upon to re
spond in behalf of ? the Supervisors. .He
said that when the present board entered
public life it entered with .nothing more
than a resolution to do its duty by the
people of San , Francisco. "I say it-is a
matter of congratulation," he said, "that
that sentiment, which â¢ they i brought into
political life, they have found reflected in
every official they have come into contact
with in the. City Hall, under the present
administration." . . * .
To what shall I speak? Of the charter? The
people have spoken of the charter and the char
ter has spoken for itself. It has given us the
best government San Francisco has ever had.
The system of the charter Is such and the
officers are such us we never had before. : All
are trying to do their duty under it. .They are
free and independent and have not gone over
to the bosses.- It Is true that the charter has
some defects. It- was made by men who were
earnest and it will not be changed until. San
Francisco is the best governed city on the
face of the earth. Gentlemen, go on with your
good work, and you will leave something for
generations to be ' proud of . â¢ . . .
We are going to have within a few weeks a
great influx of soldiers. Between now and the
1st of June 30,000 men will be landed in this
harbor. I hope they will be discharged here.
Twenty thousand soWiers will be going the
other way to take their places. I am glad they
all come through this city, as It means millions
of dollars to its citizens. ;.':,._ .
Joseph Britton. president of the* Board
of Freeholders who prepared the charter,
was next introduced, and said in part:
My stay here being momentary I have been
unable to vote, but after the 1st day of July,
if retired by the Congress of -the United States,
I hope to spend many happy years here. (Ap
plause.)
_ The relations of the military with the city
government have been extremely pleasant. It
could hardly be otherwise. The relative posi
tions of those two authorities are so clearly
marked that they could not help but agree. The
army question is agitating the country and
Just at this time I regard It as one of the most
important In the history- of the nation. If
nothing is done by the 1st day of July our army
of 90,000 men will be reduced to 25,000. We will
not have enough to maintain ourselves. We
have got to that station where we must have
an army to uphold it. It is possible that In
Manila we could hold that city against the
Philippine archipelago, but there is no man
here who would like to see our army placed on
The Mayor then introduced General
Shafter, who was greeted. with cheers,
when he said that he had lived here fif
teen years and he was delighted to hear
something and to say something on the
workings of the city government. In which
he was interested as a citizen of the
United States. In part he, said:
San Francisco has progressed during the year
from a condition of uncertainty to one of cer
tainty in the direction of the administration
of the government by a system of civil service.
It -is true- that a- doubt has been raised, but
civil service haÂ« been introduced as we pre
dicted it. and with success. We have met ob
stacles which we expected, and whatever may
be the result of the judicial decision yet to be
rendered on the charter, civil service will ap
ply and be in force. If we need the assistance
of the Legislature we can have. It.
San Francisco, having a position of. world
wide Imj5ortance on the path of the world's
travel. Is our city, and we who live so close to
this great object do not appreciate Its Im
portance In that regard, and it Is well for us
to know that San Krancisco Is a city that will
rank in its commercial and geographical im
portance with the greatest cities of the world.
We are. the housewives of the city. We are
not the bread-winners. We must have our
house orderly and receive the people of the
world who visit here, and I am pleased to hear
that the President is to visit us here, and we
must pee to it that San Francisco is made an
Ideal commonwealth, so that It becomes really
conspicuous. A city built on the hills could
not be lost sight of. We are charged with the
<Juty of seeing that 'ft- is made clean, sanitary
and beautiful. These are our ;i>lmple duties,
and I am pleased to say that every man within
the sound of my voice has In his own depart
ment made It his plan toXaccompllsh this re
sult. â¢ " :
San Franciscor has aesumed a position of
world-wide importance, particulnrly on account
of Its position, and, I may eay In a civic sense,
largely because It Is Hying an experimental
charter considered by the jicopl? who observe
these things the best organic act in thr world."
At the banquet board there are gentlemen
representing the Federal Government. I-aat
year- we. were quite alone, but it occurred to
me that the city is interested in affairs
outside of its own limits, and that durinfc thu
last two or three years we have been thrown
into close relationship, and it seemed to me to
bo proper that we meet the officers represent
ing the President of the United States. (Ap
plause.)
It Is a very difficult thing to begin proceed
ings of- this kind, .and probably a little less
difficult in ending. I come here to greet you
at the closo of the year â after your services to
the city â and. recall that we met here Just a
year ago, almost under similar circumstances,
to meet one another and to give some assur
ances to the city that our work would be ear
nest and. we trust, intelligent. And now after
a year we can come here and congratulate our
selves, and it will be news for you to hear,
for the papers have not reported It, that the
charter government has been a very great suc
cess during the last twelve months. (Ap

A SOUR STOMACH
Is Often the Real Cause of a Sour
Temper.
That- the condition of the digestive or-
gans has a marked effect upon the char-
acter or disposition is a truism as old as
the hills, uld Ben Johnson wisely said
"the pleasure of living depends upon the'
liver," ar.d It is a fact which none may I
dispute that a sunny . disposition more i
often results from a healthy digestion I
than from any other cause, i |
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called sour j
stomach or heartburn, is caused by slow 1
digestion of food; instead of being prompt- !
ly digested and converted into blood, bone !
and muscle, It lies in the stomach for 'â¢
hours, fermenting and decaying, creating i
gases which cause pressure on the lungs
and heart, short breath and general dis- 1
comfort and irritation. |
Such half digested food Is Indeed poor j
nourishment for Â¦ the body, brain and '
nerves, and the result is shown in Irrita-
ble tempers, unaccountable headaches ami :
that depressing condition usually called
the "fflues," :but. how quickly all these
disappear when appetite and digestion are I
restored! . â¢
Laxative medicines only irritate the al- '
ready irritated stomach and bowels and 'â¢
have no eftect upon actual digestion of '
food. t Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ - !
The sensible course to follow is to make
use of ; simple, natural digestives like I
Stuart's. Dyspepsia- Tablets after meals i
until the stomach has a chance to recu-
perate. -
The natural digestives .which ev-ry
healthy ttomach contains Â«Â»re peptor.es,
diastase and hydrochloric and lactic acids,
and when any of them are lacking the
trouble begins. Th"e reason Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are so valuable and suc-
cessful in curing Btomath troubles is be-
cause they contain, in a pleasant, concen-
trated tablet form, all these absolutely
necessary essentials for perfect digestion
and -assimilation of food. -Â¦ *
Henry Kirkpatrick of Lawrence, Mass.,
says: "Men and women, whose occupation
precludes an active, outdoor life should
make it "a' daily practice:, to. use Stuart's
Dyspepsia '.Tablets ;â¢ after Â¦ meals. I have
done so myself and I know, positively that
I owe my .present health and vigor to
their daily-use/ : . " : '1 Â¦ r
; "From the time I was 22. when I gradu-
ated from school with broken health from
overwork; until I was 34,, I scarcely knew
what it was to bs free from stomach
weakness. I had no appetite whatever
for breakfast and very little for any other
meal.
"I ' had acidity and heartburn nearly
every day t and sometimes was alarmed by
Irregularity and palpitation of the heart,
but all this gradually disappeared nfter I
began, using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and ' I . can : eat ' my meals with . relish j and
satisfaction which I had not known since
I was; a growing boy." "s
The success and popularity of Stuart's
Dyspepsia -Tablets Is enormous, but it Is
deserved; and every druggist In the United
States, Canada \ and Great Britain has a
good word for this meritorious prepara-
tion. :*',-, ;

The Rev II. T. Nelson of Battle Creek,
Mich.*, a prominent missionary In the Sev
enth Day Adventist denomination, was
arrested this afternoon and locked up at
the City Prison upon complaint of the
Rev. C. M. Gardiner, pastor of the Sev
enth Day Adventist Church of this city.
The pastor, was compelled to twice sum
mon the police to the church. at Twelfth
and Brush streets to-day to eject the
Michigan minister, who persisted In inter
rupting the worship which was in prog
ress.
'ine Battle Creek missionary went to
the services at the church this morning
and took a prominent seat among the con
gregation. He waited until the exercises
of the morning were well under way, and
then arose in his pew and demanded to
be 'heard. Before those . near by could
Btlll the Interruption. Rev. Mr. Ntlson
was loudly denouncing an audience with
the pastor In his pulpit.
Several of the church officers ruehed over
to Nelson and tried to quiet him, but they
could do nothing until he was summarily
ejected, the police being called. A eec
ond time Nelson entered the church, but
before the i police arrived he had gonÂ«
away. â¢
Rev. Mr. Gardiner had no desire to
cause the arrest of the disturber, but tha
pastor did not want his worshipers an
noyed. Â¦ Â¦ This afternoon' the newcomer re
appeared, at the church and again aroused
the' people with /his vociferous demands to
be he&rd. . . ,. . .. . .
Again the police were summoned and.
this time they succeeded In arresting thÂ«
preacher, who appeared as one who might
be slightly unbalanced mentally 1 ..- Nelson
made no resistance, to Arrest. He -lid not
seem to realize that his actions had in
any wise been sufficiently unpleasant to
warrant suppression. . .
"I came here .1, month ago from the
headquarters of the Adventists at Battle
Creek to do missionary work," explained
the arrested preacher. "When I went. to
church I this i mornlnu , I simply . made up
my mind that I desired to: talk with the
pastor about holding some .meetings here.
I started to address .Mm during the *er r

Special Dispatch to The Call.
went out to search for some one to make
the will. This may be a mistake, how
ever.
With a small fortune in sight for some
one. the resident Swedish Consul has em
ployed Messrs. Loewy & Gutsch as attor
neys to contest the paper filed by Annie
J. Armstrong. A lively battle is therefore
in sight for the custody of the miser's
money and it may yet reach his heirs in
Sweden.
No difficulty was experienced yesterday
in locating Mrs. Armstrong and Messrs.
Obrol and Frederic. The* last two
named were at the Coso House. Fred
eric does not tspeaJt English. Cabrol had
lltie to say, except that he had held
Erickson's hand when the cross was made
for Erickson's signature. He did this,
he said, because Erickson was too weak
to write.- Frederic said, as interpreted
by Cabrol. that he had witnessed the pa
per with Cabrol and that he had signed it
under Cabrnl's name.
Mrs. Annie J. Armstrong was found at
fi25 Pine street last evening. She is.
seemingly, about 30 years of age, and
rather good looking. She told her story
breifly after remarking that her lawyers
had told her not to talk.
"J was very kind to the old man." she
Fafrl. "not because I thought h? had
money, but because I was sorry for_h!m.
He was old and sick %nd friendle*<s.' : "i did
what I could for him and. when'l was
itfay from the Coso House he Â¦would send
for me. He was, ill about a year and I
wflÂ» with him much of the time. He" was
not kept In bed much of . the time, -but ho
was not well." . : '.
"Did you know that he was going to
make a will?"
"My lawyers told me not to talk. No,
I was not there when the will was mad"."
Mrs. Armstrong would not Pay anything
mrre about the matter, except that she
felt sure that the, court would give her
the money and 'that she was a seamstress
and that Erickson knew she had hard
work to get a living.
Erickson lived most, wretchedly for
years, picking up crusts In the street and
subsisting upon the refuse. of markets.
,He died amid squalid surroundings indi
cating groat poverty. Ills bank books
show, however, that the sum of J260 was
drawn from the bank last June in divi
dends. All .the cash he had about him
when he died was S5 cents. He was
formerly a miner, but had lived In Fan
Francisco manv years and was a familiar
figure In certain. localities.

GREAT BRITAIN WORRIED
BY BOLD BOER TACTICS
OLT> Leros Erfckson. a miser,
aped 77. full ol the pains and
wcartnr ?? of age. died on the last
day of the century at the Coso
House. 411 Saovime street. AftÂ«>r
bÂ« had r-a*sÂ«*d away the Public Admlnis-
Trator came into possession of two bank
books. Indicating that Erickson had JlO.t-09
rirposltfd with the Hibtmia Savings Bank
end the Sa\ir.gÂ« and ix>an Society. TheÂ«Â»Â»
booka were received bs H. C. Wilbur for
the Public Administrator from Adrian
Cabrol. nne of the proprietors of the
house. Mr. Wilbur was Informed "by Cab
r^l that there were no writings or papers
in the house belonging to Erickson.
Wilbur says that Cafcrol spoke to him
as follows when he handed him the bank
books:
"On the Sunday r.lg'.it preceding the day
cf his death Erickson asked me to see if
I could not find some one to make hiÂ«
ârill, as he Intended to leave the most of
hi? property to poople m the hotel. I went
out ana looked, but Â»U places were closed
and I couldn't find ant' one to make th<:
will."' - .
In making this statement Cabrol ap
p^ar^d to H'llbur to bo much ulsappoln*
fti. The Public Administrator was^notl-
JietJ by Wilbur of what hafl been said a:
the Coso House. On tne 2d day of Janu- '
ary the Administrator filed a petition for
letters of administration on Erickson's
<stÂ£ie. Two days later, to his surprise-,
fcrlvrter & Hopkins, attcrneys. filed what
purport* to be the last will and test&me;!L
of Erickson. It belr.g *--:}jned with a cross.
This is a peculiar document. In it Mr*.
Annie J. Armstrong of C23 Pine. street is
mentioned as the dearest friend of the
,...-, ncerj and a pchedule of his posyessiom
jp set forth, but the document does not
say that these possessions are to go to
the lady. It was undoubtedly the inten
tion of" the person drawing the alleged
will to name her as devisee but. this was
rot done. Mrs. Armstrong is employed at
the Cofo House.
This document is dated December 27.
*$*vÂ». and the name? nf Adr'en Cabrol and
Dflmas Frederic, his partner, are at
tached to It as those cf witnesses.
The> date of the alleged will indicates

LEROS ERICKSON. THE DEAD MISER, AND THE ALLEGED WILL UN
DER WHICH MRS. ANNIE ARMSTRONG HOPES TO SECURE $10 000
LEFT BY HIM.
The arguments on the motion to set
aside the Indictment of the Grand Jury
charging Mrs. Nettie R. Craven with per
jury alleged to have been committed by
her in her efforts to prove that she was
the widow of the late James G. Fair were
heard before Judge Cook yesterday. MrÂ«.
Craven was In court. She has discarded
the use of crutches and looks like her
former self. ' ; â¢
Attorney T. D, Rlordan opened the ar
gument for Mrs. Craven. He claimed
that, in the indictment no allegation was
made that Judge Troutt, in whose court
it Is alleged the perjury was committed,
had jurisdiction of the subject matter or
of thd person of the defendant, and that
there was no allegation that Senator Fair
had any estate. He took special excep
tion- to the mode of procedure of the
Grand Jury In bringing in an indictment
against the defendant for perjury, when,
in fact, a complaint should have been
made before a committing magistrate or
the indictment should have been brought
in by a subsequent Grand Jury. There
had been a willful disregard of the rights
of the accused, he said, and he quoted
authorities to show that in that regard
alone the indictment should be set aside.
Attorney Charles â¢ Pence argued that it
was improper for the Grand Jury to ask
the defendant to testify against herself.
Nothing was said in the indictment as to
the defendant committing perjury before
Judge Troutt. but the grand Jurors them
selves were the .witnesses ror the indict
ment, and in that respect were not a com
petent body. .
Attorney W. W. Foote pointed out al
leged- defects in the language of the in
dictment. The defendant was not indicted
for committing perjury before Judge
Troutt, but before the Grand Jury.
Attorney Ruef raised the technical point
that no part of the testimony falsely
given by a witness was material unless
it was given with the view to the pre
sentment of an indictment or Information
to the court. In this case the defendant
was not po advised; In the indictment
It was also stated that the defendant had
testified in substance to certain facts. He
argued that it was essential that the ex
act words on which perjury was based be
given, and not their substance.
Assistant District Attorney Deupfey re
plied briefly for the people, contending;
that the indictment was proper and should
be sustained.
The Judge advised Deuprey to answer
all the points raised by the defendant's
attorneys and also the points raised by
them when arguing the demurrer to the
indictment some time ago. which was at
the time denied. The principal point at
that time Taised was the prejudice that
lay In the minds of the jurors at the time
the indictment was found. As the case
stood the matter could be taken before
the Supreme Court and probably upheld,
and he wanted to have all the authorities
no that he could bo in a position to decide
for himaelf. He gave Deuprey five days
in which 10 submit .his authorities In an
swer to the points raised by the defend
ant's attorneys and they were allowed
five days to reply. The decision will be
rendered on January 26.

Thus Oaring thi Drunkard With-
out His Co-operation,
The Remedy Is Sent Free to All
Aft*r many years of unceasing endeavor Dr.
J. \V. Halnes has finally secured the indorrr-
ment of the professions for his remarkable rern-
Â«-<ly, GcMcn Specific. This remedy Is odorless
and taMelees, Is mixed with coffee, tea.' milk or
food and riven the drunkard secretly. Its effpet
is remarkable, curing canes In a short time that
eeemed absolutely hopeles*.
Rev. Schimpfelman. a noted German divine,
cays: "I am gratified to say that I have met
many cayes of drunkenness cured by' Golden
Epeclflc. The t ecrecy with which it can be uned
is certainly a great gain to the cause of temper-
ance."
UBS. IRENE FLORENCE, Truklin, Wtmn CV, 0.
Dr. Rene Chabot, one of the greatest of. medi-
cal scientists, ea>s: "Golden Spectflc is the only
cure for drunkenness. It leaves no aftereffects
and I have frequently prescribed it to be Kiven
secretly by tbÂ« drunkard's wife, mother or
Â¦daughter."
Franklyn Waters, who has moved thousands
by his cttninK temperance lectures, says: "No
amount of eloquence can equal the wonderful
accomplishments of Golden Specific. . It is the
greatest temperance worker the world has ever
seen. I have known It to cure drunkards who
were always too drunk to even attend a temper-
ance lecture. Every woman should do her best
to make Golden Specific a household word."
Mr*. Irene Florence, box 13$, Franklin, War-
ren County, Ohio, eays:
. "I had for years patiently borne the disgrace,
suffering, misery and privations due to my. hus-
band's drinking habits. Hearing of, your mar-
velous I remedy for the cure of drunkenness,
which I could give my husband secretly, I de-
cided to try It. I mixed it in his food and cof-
fee, and, as the remedy Is odorless, and taste-
less, i he did not' know what/ it was that so
quickly relieved his craving for liquor. I soon
found out that my mission was a complete suc-
cess and that Golden 8pectflc had wrought al-
most a miracle for me: I want others to profit
by my. experience and | if you want. you are at
liberty, to refer to me as having told you about
this ;marvelous remedy."

" Two clergymen* who went to Germany
last year for treatment by a noted special-
ist were tokl that they must u*e Grape-
NutF. made In America, at Battle Creek.
Mich., for the principal part of each meal.
This pujrsestion interested the two di-
vines Kroatly. for ' while they knew of
Grape-Nuts and that there was^a largre
ose made of the food in America, it h'ad
newer cornÂ» their way to try It.
A lady Jn Heddlng. N. H.. Mrs. Otis
Cole, eays the after-effect of the grip was
a Ecrioun gastric and stomach trouble.
All the following rummer she had many
attacks of palpitation of the heart, nau-
sea, psin. faintness. insomnia, and all the
other iils which accompany impaired
nerve force and -indigestion.
She began using Grape-Nuts to build
her up and found at once that the food
created no disturbance and ehe began to
gain In ?tren&th ar.d courage. In October
Fhe vent for a vteSt and took Grape-Nuts
v.lth her to uee each day. She gained 10
pounds In wHjrht In about four months
and fully recovered her health.
She further says: "While I am now
entirely well, I shall probably adhere to
Crape-Nuts during the balance of my
life. My brother-in-law, a practicing phy-
â¢ician. *ayÂ« Grape-Nuts Bimroered in milk,

Grape- Nuts In her handbag, for she sayn

HE mall steamship Mariposa came
j I into port Â¦with flying colors yester
j I <Ja y. She was two days ahead of
II time and both passengers and crew
were delighted with the trip. Cap
tain James Rennle *ays that had It not
been for delays at Auckland, Pago Pago
and Honolulu he would have beaten all
records. As it is the steamship made the
run from Sydney. N. B. \\~., in the actual
sailing: time cf 2<i days IS hours and 36
minutes.
On the outward trip the Mariposa beat
her maiden record by over fifteen hours.
On the homeward run she was delayed at
Auckland five hours, waiting: for the mail
at Pag-o Pago. Samcf., nearly three hours
and at Honolulu over nine hours. At the
latter port the delay was caused by the
stevedores refusing to work at night.
From Honolulu the Mariposa beat her
j-revious record by over two hours.
During the run from Australia the Mar
iposa averaged a -little , over 357 knots a
day. while the best run" of the trip was
SC5 fcnats knots made in 23 hours 32 min
utes, just before the t'arallones were
reached.
The following cabin passengers came up

There was in the mail steamer's cargo !
forty boxes of specie valued at over

Stales $20 gold pieces.
The Mariposa left Honolulu after the
Zsalandia. but the latter vesnel has not
yet reached port. She will be in early
this morning. The chances are that the
Mariposa will go out on the Zealandia's
run to Honolulu on January 18. while the
Zealandia may go on a Central American
run. The n^w mail boat Sonoma will take
the Marinosa's run to Hawaii, Samoa,
I\"ew Zealand and Australia.
NEWS OF THE OCEAU. ,
Lonirshoremen at Outs
There are two longshoremen's unions,
and what one does is not countenanced by
the other. Union No. 1 insists on a scale
cf K cents an hour and is backed up in
its demands by the teamsters and coal
phovelers. I'nion No. 2 is willing to allow
its men M> work for 40 cents an hour, and
this is the rate paid on the Mail dock,
transport wharf. Oceanic dock and by the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company. Un
ion No. 2 is backed by the Sailors* Union,
and lately when the Hyadrs came in the
<d-e<?nt men sot the job and the others
were left out in the cold. The men have
ccme to the conclusion that there Is no
rise in cutting each other's throats, so a
conference of both branches of the long

No other change has been made in the light
A set of questions drafted by the City
Engineer was furnished Schussler eo that
he could study, them over and be. ready
to answer them when the Supervisors
meet, next -week; to discuss' the water
rates.
All attempts on the part olvReed to get
Schussler to tell how much in excess of
$30,000,000 . he thought the plant worth
failed. He promised, however* to produce
at the next session, showing how
he arrived at the valuation given by him.
"I don't want to. discourage the scheme
of the city having its own- waterworks,"
said he, "for I favor municipalownership
of public utilities. But when the city buys
a wattrworks, the Supervisors want to be
sure to buy the rignt one. Had the city
bought the Spring Valley .works, at the
time it offered $11,000,000 for the plant it
would have been a good investment. But
the company would -not sell for that
amount and since then J17.000.000 has been
expended in improvements and purchase
of property. Much of the property has
greatly appreciated in value, and . as I
said before the works are now worth
more than J30.000.000. Why don't you gen
tlemen appoint a committee to confer with
a committee from the directors of, the
company? The Spring Valley Company
Js -willing to sell to the city and I am sat
isfied that a trade can soon be made.- Our
people'are as anxious to sell as the city is
to buy. - If you don't want the entire
plant let there be an arbitration commit
tee appointed. Then throw out what you
don't want and pay a fair -price for the
balance. The works can with small cost
be made to furnish twice the present sup
ply of water and you can never talk of
San Francisco having too much water.
I predict that" within the next twenty
five years the will have grown so
large that the reservoirs at presenfused
for storage purposes will be used as dis
tributing reservoirs.'-'
"What valuation do you place on the
Spring Valley Water Company as a
whole?" asked Supervisor Reed.
"I think its value is in excess of $30,
000,000,"- answered the witness. 1
"The use of electricity in the city," said
Mr. Schussler, "has caused but very lit
tle damage to the cast iron pipes. In only
one instance has any of the larger mains
been damaged by the laying of under
ground electric light and power wires."
In reply to a question asked by Mayor
Phelan, Schussler said that he did not
think that there was any leakage in the
pipes laid under the bay. He thought,
however, that their inside diameter nad
been reduced probably 10 per cent by sedi
ment, since they were laid in 18S7. He said
it is the intention of the company to lay
another pipe line across the bay during
the coming summer. Taking everything
into consideration, Schussler was of the
opinion that an annual allowance of 1 per
cent on the cost of construction of the
works* would be fair and cover all deteri
oration. ' . â¢ . Â¦
The Spring - Valley "Water Company Is
willing to sell its plant to the city. Chief
Engineer Schussler so informed the Su
pervisors yesterday afternoon and added
that he thought the matter could be
speedily arranged if a committee was ap
pointed to confer with the directors of the
company. The statement was madÂ© by
Schussler while being examined as a wit
ness at the investigation being made pre
paratory to, the ( fixing of the water rates
for the coming fiscal ' year. Engineer
Schussler, who is suffering from a heavy
cold, said that he attended the meeting in
disobedience of the orders" of his phy
sician, upon a promise being made him by
Supervisor. Reed that he would be al
lowed to fully answer all questions' asked
him without interruption. Several times
during the 1 examination he complained
that Supervisor Reed was attempting to
put wrong answers into his mouth and
place him in a false light. Keed, who
conducted the examination, first wanted
to k.mnv If the witness considered that all
of v the expenses of the company should
come out of the water rates charged.
Schussler replied that he did and added
that when the city owned its water works
the Supervisors would learn the necessity
cf having a fund for expenses, and con
tinuing, he said that he believed that an
annual allowance of 2V& per cent for de
terioration on wrought iron pipes and 1
per cent on the pumping stations would
be fair. The dams, tunnels and reservoir*
are so constructed that the deterioration
on them was lnflnitesimally , small, he
said.

Per James Latdlaw.
The. following letter told Mrs. Underhlll
how the drafts had been received by the
bank bn which they were drawn:
OFFICE OF L,AIDI,AW ft; CO.
14 Wall Btreet, New York.
August 29, 1893.
These checks were" dated San Francisco,
January 3, 1833, and were drawn by Watt
on the American Bank and Trust Com
pany of San Francisco in favor of : Mrs.
Fannie A. . Underhill. Â¦ Mrs. Underhlll re
ceived them at Goshen. N. Y., and sent
them later on to the office of Laidlaw &
Co.. 14 Wall street, New York City, for
collection. Â¦ . . . Â¦Â¦'
Â¦ Almost two years later "Watt gave this
mortgage to Mrs. Underhlll as Â¦ security
for kls note for $2326 38.
In the fall of lS92,Mrs. Underhlll went
to New York State to visit relatives. She
expected certain remittances from "Watt,
consisting, she alleges, of money sent to
her bankers in San Francisco. What
ever correspondence passed between Mrs.
and Watt is immaterial, but It
resulted In Watt sending three checks to
her for $375, $T)00 and $500 respectively.
The, second mortgage and note given by
Watt to Mrs. Underhlll as security were
as worthless as the Rankin documents.
.The second set of papers were made by J.
Stadtfeld Jr. of Alameda In favor of
James Alva Watt, the note and mortgage
being for $1000. Investigation shows that
the 'mortgage is dated March 1, 18S9, and
was recorded iif Alameda County on the
same date in Book of Mortgages 307," page
360. At the request of Watt the mort
gage was released on November 6, 1890.
and was so recorded on November '12.

various times airas of rrtoney aggregating
$30,000 for the vurpose of keeping the busi
ness In Chicago from going to ruin, and
that not a scrap of paper was ever given
by Watt to Mrs. Underhlll to phow that
he had invested .the money as he claimed
he had done.
The evidence now in tho possession of
Mrs. Underhill as to the worthless docu
ments which gave her as security
for the loans she made to him is of a na
ture that has pent many other men to the
penitentiary for long terms.
Watt's business relations with Mrs.
Underhilf date back to the '80s of.tho past
century, when Watt was retained as at
torney by her in divorce proceedings she
brought against her husband.' It was not
long after the retention of his services
by Mrs. Underhill that Watt began to
borrow money from her. "
On January 1, 1892, Watt gave Mrs. Un
derhill his note for $2326 38, the .note be
ing made for one day and to bear Interest
at 7 per cent until paid. Mrs. Underhill
says this money was loaned to Watt and
when she asked him for some security he
gave her two mortgages and two notes
from other parties made in Watt's, favor.
Mortgages are considered gilt-edged" se
curity by some persons and Mrs. Under
hlll Is one of these believers. The mort
gages and notes given by Watt as se
curity to Mrs. Underhill are now in her
possession.
Investigation shows that the mortgages
were absolutely worthless when they
passed from Watt's possession. One note,
and mortgage Is for $1000 and were made
in Watt's favor by Mrs. Sarah Rankin, a
widow, who resided In San Francisco.
The note and mortgage were made on De
cember 27, 18S8, the mortgage being re
corded In the Hall ot Records on the
samo date in Book of Mortgages S35, page
367.' Under date of September 20, 1830.
Book of Releases 157, page 254, at the Hall
of Records, reads as follows: -
James Aha Watt to Sarah Rank'.n: These
JAMDS ALVA WATT, a well
known attorney, v.ill shortly be
called upon to answer a most se
nous and long threatened charge
â the betrayal of the sacred trust
r^posfd in him by a woman cli
ent, who avers that by the deceit
practiced by Watt she has been defrauded
of nearly $35,000.
Watt's accuser Is Mrs. Fannie A. Under
hill. whose former husband was once a
prominent citizen of San Francisco. Mrs.
fn'lerhill for fome years has been un
able to prosecute her charges against
Watt owing* to the disappearance of her
fortune. Friends and relatives In the
Kast are now determined that the -wheels
of JUFtice. long clogged, snail be pet in
ir.otlon and that the looters of her for
tune shall be brought to bar and punished
to the full extent" of the law.
The charges made by Mrs. Underhlll
against Watt are numerous. One charge,
Eeemlngly backed up with the most con
vincing proof, la that Watt, knowing that
nis client, Mrs. UnderhiU. had as much
faith in him as she had In her physician
or her pastor, secured large loans from
her. giving therefor his note and turning
over to tier securities which, as investiga
tion prove?, were not worth the paper
they were written on, the worthless char
acter of these securities being, it Is
claimed, well known to Watt.
Another charge Is that Watt, having
certain money belonging to. Mrs. Under
bill in his possession and being requested
to remit the eame to the East, where the
la<3y was residing, sent her checks on a
Ean Francisco bank, which checks were
dishonored, as Watt had no funds to his
eccount in the Institution on which they
'vere drawn.
Another charp<> which Mrs. TJnderhlll
makes against Watt Is that while acting
es h'cr attorney he went to Chicago to in
vestigate a bu?!nefs concern there in
vhich Mrs. Underhill had Invested $20,009.
and that he incuccd her to send him at

When the number of boxing contests
that take place annually in this country
and others is considered the small num
ber of fatalities that result from the sport
is truly wonderful. Anoiner phase of the
question that should be fully weighed is
that in only a few instances have fatil
results attended a boxing bout where two
men of- international fame were the prin
cipals. This is ample attestation to what
in claimed for the. tport in the way of
careful preparation. With a well-planned
and systematic course of training two
men of good health &nd robust physique
take no more chances ol incurring fatal
injuries in a ring contest than in any
other athletic sport of a violent nature,
especially the great college game,' football.
The most recent Instance where, a par
ticlpant'-succumbed to injuries received
witn a pugilist of worldwide fame was
Guldo, the Frenchman, who died March
11, 1900, from injuries claimed to have been
received in a boxing bout with James J.
JeiTrie.s, the champion of the -world.:. Pre
vious to this Con Riordan's death from
the effects of a blow delivered by Robert
Fitzsimmons, former champion of the
world, whose sparring partner he . was,
stood out as the only fatality received al
tho hands of a flrpt-class man.

There was quite a .Â«rrowl over the defeat
of Pat Morrlssey, favorite for the last
numbtr, a six-furlong sprint. It Â¦was Just
his going, Buchanan broke" away second
Erratic Bathos, with only ninety-nine
pound? in the saddle, made a funny look
ing sight bt the abbreviated field starting
for the Candelaria handicap, over one
mile and seventy yards. As: good as 14
to 5, the chestnut colt went out and spread
eagled his field. HopelesHly overweighted ,â¢
as he generally is, The Fretter led Tela
man, the favorite, out for place honors.
: Because he finished second to Tenny
Belle some days ago, through a fluke, El
Karn was chalked up favorite for the
five-furlong selling dash. Showing some
speed, he ran third. In a hard drive, Bu
chanan on Litmus earned the decision
over El Sonoro by a neck. The winner
was played from 8 down to 5.
The weather was cloudy and foggy and
the track as muddy as two or three days
of rain were possible to make it. Nothing
deterred, the regulars were augmented by
the Saturday contingent, and tne ring was
crowded. The books had all the best of
it fiom the iump. for Kgsciice ?.t short
odds enjoyed the distinction of bcirg; the
only winning favorite. Buchanan seems
to be regaining: his old form, for he pilot
ed thtte winners, while Mounce camÂ©
next with two. The latter rider has been
extremely successful in piloting stake
winners, and received Quite an ovation
for his capture of the Follp.nsbee. â¢
If fast trials count for anj thing. Com
panion looked best of the botch starting
in the , introductory sprint, and closed a
7 to 5 choice. The filly, with Buchanan
up, led into the stretch and was then beat
en with ease by Darlene, an S to 1 shot
from Dr. Rowell's stable. . Wardman,
with 8 to 1 about him to show, ran third.
Charley Ellison's bold bluffer Astor cut
quite a dash for a time in the mile and a
furlons selling run. He failed to stay,
however, and the 3 to 4 favorite. Essence,
ridden by Buchanan", won handily by over
a 1 length. Marty Bergen- landed None

Golden Age, carrying Bullman and 122
pounds. Tho field had been so reduced by
scratching that it was practically brought
down to a contest between the colts men
tioned. There was some doubt as to
whether Articulate would go seven fur
longs, and as the other had already per
formed creditably at the distance, Hil
dreth's entry was installed favorite, at
odds of 8 to 5. Not much was thought of
the chances of Gibraltar, Herculean or
Boundlee, but the Victoria-bred horse,
Broadbrim, came in for extensive backing,
the books being compelled to cut his odds
from 8 down to 5 at one stag^e of the spec
ulating. Owing to the Jockeying of
Mounce and Bullman there was a delay
of . twenty minutes at the post before Mr.
Caldwell dropped his flag. Bullman, on
Golden Age, succeeded in getting away in
front, but It availed him little; Mounce
rushed Articulate through to the lead, and
the race needs'no description. As the turn
for the stand was reached, nothing behind
the leader looked to have a chance except
the first choice, and his a. remote one, for
Bullman had reached for his whip thus
early. Approaching, the wire, Articulate
himself tired under the fast clip set anl
Mounce hand rode the brown fellow to
win by over a length. Golden Age held
a mortgage on the place, for Gibraltar,
the third horse, was six lengths farther
away. For their little jollification at the
post, Mr. Caldwell fined Bullman $100 and
Mounce $50. Mr. Price, the presiding
steward, did .not quite agree with the
starter over the infliction of the last pen
alty, and possibly both sums may be re
mitted.

Light Sensational Story.
WASHINGTON, Jari. 12,-The appoint-
ir.ent of F. K. Richards of Washington
as United States Marshal of Alaska In
place of C. L. Vawter of Montana uncov-"
ers rather a sensational story. " . Â¦*
Vawter was appointed about a year ago
on the recommendation of Senator Carter.
From affidavits filed in the office of the
Attorney General, It appears that last
summer he called on Judge Noyes of the
United States District Court at Nome and
said that friends had authorized him to
offer Noyes $20,000 In gold dust as a con
sideration for the, removal of Alexander
McKenzie, who had been appointed re
ceiver of certain mining properties then
in disDute and In charge of the court.
Judge IS'oyes called In the District Attor
ney and O. K. Wheeler of Minneapolis,
his private secretary, and required Vaw
ter to repeat his- proposition in their pres
ence. Vawter attempted to crawl out of
the scrape, but finally agreed to. place hla
rtsignatlon as United States Marshal in
the hands of Judge Noyes if the latter
would let the matter drop. Judge Noyes
agreed to do so. and forwarded the resig
nation by. mail to Senator Carter, on
whose recommendation Vawter had been
appointed, with a detailed explanation of
the circumstances. Senator Carter held
back the resignation until he was pre
pared to recommend a successor, and
then filed it with *he Attorney General.

Into matrimony, is a secret they are no*
disclosing. The young folks not only di't
decide to cast conventionality to th-Â»
winds, but proceede-1 it once to carry
their decision into effect.
By carefully arranged plans they met
at Napa on June 24, 1899. The matter of a
license was easily fixed, and so well was
that official necessity guarded against
publicity that the record was burled deep
ly enough to hide the secret all these
months.
The witnesses to the marriage were
Mrs. Thorn, wife of the officiating rector
and W. J. Collins, the County Clerk of
Napa County, who Issued the license.
Immediately after the ceremony Mr. and
Mrs. watt returned to Oakland by sepa
rate routes and resumed their accustomed
places in society. Mrs. Watt went to her
parents' residence In Kast Oakland and
kept her own counsel. Her husband re
mained with his parents at their Madison
street home, and nothing occurred that
would give families or friends the slight
est inkMng of The momentous event.
In due time the young people announced
their engagement. Time rolled on, and
nearly a year had passed from the date
of that ensagemnt. t
When the couple began to consider that
society would be soon expecting the wed
ding it is surmised that they decided to
forestall any Inquiry by quietly announc
ing that there would be no further wed
ding ceremony necessary. Last night they
told the story of the Napa wedding to
their respective families. To-day Harold
Middleton. a brother of- the bride, made
the public statement for his sister and
brother-in-law. He said:
"Mr. and Mrs. Watt have given no rea
son for the secret marriage. They made
it known last evening. There would have
been absolutely no objection to the mar
riage. That is' evident, of course, from
the fact that they did announce their
engagement a year ago."
Mr. and Mrs. Watt left this evening for
San Jose. Their future home will be in
San Krancisco.

Oakland Office. San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Jan. 12.
The efforts of the Sheriff. Deputy Coro
ners and other offlceis engaged in inves
tigating the murder of aged Jess Broder
sen near Alvarado Thursday night have
not availed to dispel the mystery sur
rounding the old man's death.
Twenty-four hours ekipsed after the find
ing of the body and the time when Sher
iff Rogers learned that a crime had been
committed' within, his bailiwick. As soon
as possible he sent otficers out to,.Al
varado to examine the scene of the kill
ing and to co-operate with the local offi
cers in tracing out my theory 'which
might offer a solution of the mystery.
Deputy Sheriff George Wales was select
ed on account of his thorough familiarity
with the locality in which the crime was
committed. â'<â¢. 7
Wales and Deputy Coroner Francis of
Alvarado made a minute examination of
the premises occupied by Brodersen.. but
found nothing to point to the identity of
the murderer. *
About twelve feet from where the body
was found is a' bush Â¦ behind which a
man might have hidden while his victim
was being lured from, the house. The
charge of shot which killed Brodersen
apparently came from about the distance
named.
A circumstance Indicating a probable
motive for the crime is the fact, weli
known in the neighborhood, that the old
man was in the habit of coming to Oak
land every Thursday and disposing of a
large amount of produce for cash. It is
known that on last Thursday . night he
had considerable monev with him. '*
He displayed this at the Half Way
House, a saloon on the Alvarado road,
when he stopped there at 5 o'clock that
afternoon to return a loan of $3 advance!
him by the landlady a few days before.
It is the theory of the officers that the
murder was committed by some one fa
miliar with Brodersen's customary time
of marketing. Â¦
Another circumstance directs suspicion
against a hard character, whose name and
location is known to the officers. Broder
sen told one of his neighbors recently,
that he was roused from sleep a few
nights previously by a disturbance among
his chickens. He said that he took his
candle and went to the coop and found
there was some one inside evidently mak
ing way with some of his fowls. When
the Intruder was challenged, he attempted
to scare the old man. and threatened to
kill him if he attempted any interference.
Brodersen -was not frightened and went
after the fellow with both fists. When
the thief saw that he was getting the
worst of the fight he begged off. and said
that he was compelled to steal to support
his invalid mother. Brodersen let him off
on his promise to keep away and commit
no further depredations on those prem
ises. Now that Thursday night's tragedy
is being discussed, the Incident has been
recalled and the story is in the hands of
the officers. .
Mrs. Sarah Knutsen of 568 Twelfth
street, a cousin of Brodersen. spent the
day at Alvarado trying to find something
â¢definite regarding her kinsman's fate. She
said: "It seems as if no one could have
I had anything against my .cousin. The
I neighbors down there all assured me that
he had the best of reputations for peace
ableness. and they all said they would
stand by me in attempting to, bring his
murderers to Justice. - Â«. ,
"This talk about my cousin's poverty
is all nonsense. He was well' off, and I
know that he had a good .deal of money
wtth him when he started home Thursday
afternoon. He was here that day. He
often came in for a visit. I am his only
living relative. He has lived alone out
at Alvarado for about twenty-four years.
"My cousin was a fine shot- and very
fond of hunting. That explains his hav
ing so many weapons in the house. But
the murder was not committed with one
of these. We examined them all.
"It is too bad that the officers, or who
ever is to blame, neglected to notify the
Sheriff for so long after the body was
found. The murderer has such a long
start now that it seems doubtful whether
they can ever find him."
Deputy Sheriff George Wales said:
"Brodernen was murdered for the money
his assassin believed he would find on
the dead body. That much is settled.
Every point we uncovered leads to that
theory as the correct one. The pockets
were all turned out, and I am satisfied
the murderer laid in wait knowing Brod
ersen would return home with money. The.
old msri's habits must have been well
known to the mysterious murderer. It
was easy enough to hide behind the tangle
of bushes near the house and in a line
with the spot where the body was found.
Brodersen was shot from a distance of
not more than twelve feet from where he
fell. That is my estimate based upon my
knowledge of the effect of birdshot such
as killed the old man.
"So far as ditect clews are concerned
we have none. . Any footprints which
might have been left by the assassin were
obliterated by the rain. There are a'Jot
of stories about the old man's ability
as a fighter, and the suspicion that, he
may have quarreled with some one is? ta<
the air. But the murder was not one. tor,
revenge. It was cold-blooded robbery/-' 1
"His nearest neighbor was a quarter
of a mile distant. John Jensen, who lives
half- a mile away, says he heard a shot
about 6 o'clock Thursday night, but paid
no special attention to i it because there
had been so much, duck shooting . there
abouts. Brodersen, so far as we can
learn, was on good terms with all of his
neighbors and bore an excellent reputa
tion. There is no evidence that the mur
derer - ransacked the house or disturbed
anything: but the old man's clothing in
his search for money."
Dr.de Pue of Alvarado commenced an
autopsy this afternoon. Coroner Mehr
tnann will hold an innuest at Centervllle
on Wednesday. The Sheriff has directed
his men to keen closely to the case un
til every possible avenue of investigation
has been covered. ' Brodersen . was a na
tive of Denmark. He â¢ had been in this
country thirty years, all except five of
which he had spent at Alvarado. â¢

Sj>eciaJ Dispatch to Tb* C* 11
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12.â Mystery sur
rounds the death of Dr. John F. tspade.
whose lifeless body was found in bed In
his room on the second i!oor of the Max
well Lodging-house, Hal Maple avenue, at
2 o'clock this afternoon. Under the left
eye was a gunshot wound, surrounded by
pewder barr.s, and that it was not a case
of suicide the absence cf a weapon proved
limply.
The discovery was made by Mrs. T. M.
Clark, the landlady of the Maxwell
House. In trying to open the door she
found that It was unlocked, and, believ
ing that the doctor was absent from his
room, she entered to make up the bed.
Her lodger was lying upon his back in
bed. his body tucked under the bedclothes
aÂ« if asleep. There was a wound under
his left eye, from which biood had flowed
hours before. The terrified woman hur
riedly left the room In search of her hus
band and told him what she had seen.
Nothing In Dr. Spade's room had been
touched on the Coroner's arrival. Th^ro
was no sign of a struggle anywhere. Tiie
Coroner found the Â«iead doctor dredged in
Ms nightclothes. The t.edelothir.g covered
hid to the shoulders. One arm was fold
ed over the body and tnc other hung over

worn. In a pocket at his vest was hi.-*
Â¦watch, still running, CMd in one of the
pockets of his trousers was J2 in small
change. Xo pistol cou-id be found in the
room.
Dr. Spade slept In a rcom facing on the
west side of Maple avenue, on the sec
ond floor. This floor is surrounded by a
porch. The room has two windows. Or.e
of these was unlocked, although closed:
the other was lowered three inches at the
top and raised three inches at the bot
tom, the lower part being protected by a
ecreen. No fingermarks were visible upon
the windows, such as might have been
left by some one seeking entrance to the
room from the porch. The door of the
room was unlocked and Dr. Spade's keys
Â¦were on the lr.side in the keyhole. H>*
was not in the habit of iockinc his door
Â¦when retiring: and had followed his usu:.l
custom when he went to his last sleep.
The only clew that could be eiven the
detective?* was that on Friday evening at
7:30 o'clock a man dressed in a llg-ht over
coat called upon Dr. Spade. He went up
etairs and shortly afterward the doctor
and his visitor went out toaether. This
was the Jast seen of the deceased.
It is presumed that I>r. Spade was Fhot
about <> o'clock in the morninc. At that
hour Mr. and Mrs. Clark were in their
own bedroom. They heard a sound which
might have been the report of a, pistol
shot, .but they thought it came from the
basf-mrnt. where the furnaceman was
li?htinÂ£ the fire.
Henry and Palmer Tucker, who occupy
a room next to Dr. Spade's, also heard a
noise that appeared to them to be the re
jwrt of a pistol. They jumped out of bed
and looked out in the hall, but, seeing no
fine and hearing: nothing more, they re
entered their apartment. The Xurnace
man in the cellar remembored havinp
heard something like the muffled report of
a small firearm.
Dr. fipade had resided at the Maxwell
for a number of month?. The landlady
t=aid to-night that he had come to live at
the Maxwell In April of last year. He
was a magnetic healer, but had no up
town office. At times he was much de
pitssrd. He was considerably behind on
rent and la-mented his inability to satisfy
her claim.
Among his effect? wax found a letter
with a San Francisco date line, written
abcut Christmas, but bearing no address.
It was sijrned. "Your loving- daughter,
Elma." The letter was written in a hope
ful vein and expressed the wish that next
Chrlstmu would pee the whole family re
united s?nd prosperous.
An autopsy was held to-night- The
phyr!<-ian found that death had ensued

Dr. John Frederick Spade was formerly
& mspnftic healer at fi29 Grove street, in
this city, where his wife and three chil
dren now reside. He went to Los Angeles
last March hoping to better his condition.
His wife received letters from him regu

Bvery member of the National -Guard of the
various States should lose no time In exprcsÂ«-
Ing to the Representatives of his State In Con
gress hie ftrons: disapproval of I the bill re
cently introduced In that body by the Secre
tary, of War for the reorganization of the
National Guard. It la proposed â¢ that the Na
tional Guard forces of the various States be
combined In one body to be called "the United
States reserve.", under the direction of the Sec
retary of War, and subject to all his whims,
and caprices. For years, the regular army has
endeavored to obtain control of the "Guard,"
and It must not be- allowed to do so now under
the cover of a bill so Ingeniously worded as
to leave the impression that , f? tn te organiza
tions are not Interfered with, â¢when as a mat
ter of fact, if this bill becomes a law. the
present organization of the "Guard" of the
various State* will be completely "wiped out."
The bill that has been introduced In
Congress for the reorganization of tho>
National Guard in the -United States haa
attracted considerable attention in guard
circles in this city ana has been discussed
at some length. The Northwestern
Guardsman of Minneapolis in the current
number says editorially:
Information from Washington. D. C. ia
to the effect that the Ordnance Bureau of
the War Department has decided that the
National Guard companies of the several
States are to be armed with the Krag-
Jorgensen rifles within six months and
that the Sprlngflelds are to be recalled.
General Miles has stated that It is tho
intention to hereafter equip the guard in
each .State' the same as the regular armv
and. fit it to. take the rtcldon twenty-four
hours*, notice if necessary. \
There is talk already of having a di
vision encampment In this State during
the current year. The term usually is ona
week, but there are >>ome who are of tho
opinion that the mobilization of the State
troops at one point for a period of a week
means the expenditure of a large sum of
money without any corresponding bene
fit to. the men who are sent to the camp to
be Instructed. It is sili that in the sjiicrt
period they cannot learn hardly anything
but that which can ba taught them- in the
armory and that the time of encampment
ought to be extended* to two weeks if
not three weeks so that the field, rank
and file would have an opportunity to ac
quire practical knowledge as to the duties
of the soldier and practical knowledge
In performing them nn:l. further, that all
camp duties and field maneuvers in camp
or field should be under the supervlslon;ot
a competent instructor from the United

Free to the
Ruptured
Dp. W. S RIee. the Well Known Au-
fnority. Sends a Trial of His
Famous Method Free to All.
Out of the chaos of old-time failure comes a
new ami startling cure for rupture. Dr. \V. S.
Rice, 418 N. Matr. St.. Adams, N. Y.. has In-
vented a method that cures without pain.
.Mil. CHAS. LANGE..
iJangtr, operation fc or an hour's loss . of time
from the day's work. To avoid all questions of
doubt he sends , free to every sufferer a fre*
trial of his method and there can be no earthly
reason why any ono, rich or poor, should not
avail themselves of this penorous offer. As an
instance of this remarkable method, the cure
of Charles LanÂ«e. Morrison, Ills., - Is a welcome
piece of Intelligence. -
Mr. Lar.Re is a well preserved old gentleman.
72 years of age, and for eighteen years had a
bad double rupture which no treatment could
cope with. AftT a short use of the Rice
method the left rupture healed entirely and the
right was almost closed in a few weeks. To-
day he is as sound as a dollar, wears no truss
or othev support and his cure is only onÂ« of
hundreds of similar cases reported by those
who uso the Rice method. Send for this freÂ«
trial. Don't be backward. It will surprise
you with its wonderful power to heal. And if
you know of other ruptured people ask them
to write or write for them: Do not fail to
write at once; do go to-day.

MIXCS . AAD MIXING.
COPPER Is tbe best mining proportion In the
W0 "J? tOHi *V. for the following reasons:
L The growing demand for copper occasioned
h v rt Â£ adyanc* la electrical construction.
Z. Tne depletion ut copper deposits, upon
-vnicn tl.e trade has hitherto largely depended.
z. The immense borikb of low-grade ore In
.avored localities, enabling companies with
inrjre capital to n-.alce ihelr properties dividend
PÂ«>ers alraort from the beginning.
i. Bolter than gold, because "gold is where
yv-j find it," and. considering the large num-
ber r.X _o!d mines, is rarely found in paying
quAiuftif*: huge bodies of copper ore carry
uc.iomi values and Jon't "peter out."
â¢ r '. letter than oil. because of the numerous
wildcat companies.
WASHINGTON COPPER MINES.
Perhaps tl.e largest ccrper deposits In the
w-or.a 2ie in the s^tate of Washington ; they were
uncovered and development work begun In,
tscn:e feectlcns only a few yrars ago: the oldest
ct the*-* minp* are pre_t producers to-day and
e.r*> making fortunes lor lae holders of the
ftock.
THE -O ROUND FLOOR" MAN. .
The tltr.e to make an imestmer.t is while the
enterprise Ik Fhaping itselfâ not alter it haÂ»
reached its perfected r .nrm. The men who make
the his nioney in every (treat enterprise are
those who come in a: the beginning, as history
proves. Wh^n the 'â¢Republic" mine In Wash-
ington wat- organized the "crnund floor men"
râ id Â£r pÂ»Â»r Fhare for thtir stock: one man who
I>ui in cs<x> fcU his t.iÂ»cis. for $*Â»0.O0O and built
a brick block in Sentle with the proceeds.
Â¦When the ' Le Roy" wÂ« organized In Spokane
four yrsâ ngo a po^r lawyer Â«?_changed his |
lejra? FÂ»rvi~f-e and .. few hundred dollars cash
for *tr<.k s-t the "ground floor" price. He has
realized over a million dollars and has some
rt^ck left. A Spokane rtenographer put all her
*arr.iriFs, J. r .OC. into "1>? Roy" stock and later
*.->!d cut for MO.**. "â¢Granite McuntaJn" fir-t
eoid on the St.- Louis market for 10c; In Elx
months it rose to J:O a Fhare. and in two
yeaâ¢ to fTS It made a hundred vast fortunes
icr i-to-khoMers. and hug paid more than J13.- I
Ooj.Guu in dJvHer.ds. There are hundreds of ilke j
Ir.stances. "I'nlon Consolidated" advanced
from So to J10. raid "Consolidated Virginia"
Irom llr to tC.%. Two yoars ago there was nit
a dividend payer In Washington: to-day there
fire Sftren. A thousand holderâ of ttork in
the "Iniex" district in Washington will receive Â¦
next year the first installment of the fortunes
that are coming to them; but remember that
*vÂ«Â»ry or.e of these fortunate persons houjtht Ht
& time Â»hÂ»n a small amount of money would
secure a large block of etock.
THE MONTEZUMA MININÂ« COMPANT.
This newest and at the same time the largest

cisely the same opportunities that thousands of
people have graeped to their profit. It has

CraiJe rre, its proximiU' to rail a-id water trans-
portation end the at-j--4ance of timber and
water on th<? properties) themselves. This and
adjarer.t regions have allâ adr produced values
amounting to 1100,000,601 and the output has
fcardly commenced.
The company is capitclized at $10,000,000. of
vhich JJ>.O00.G" rt >* trvr.Fury stock, non-assess-
able under the laws of Washington.
THE MOXTEZUMA'S PROPERTIES.
The four propertied cf the "Tacoaia" group
are dPFtm^J to become one of the most pro-
ductive vr.'.rn's on the Parifie Coast. These alone,
when developed, will brir.g the company's stock
to par. The ore is tlv>wii in a vein thirty feet
â¢wide, which is trace-Lie on the Furface the
Â¦who:* width of the company's holdings. The
Tai-orra tur.nel has been driven over one hun-
dred feet in solid ore tunning over $60 per ton.
Thrn? are fifteen distinct veins of minerals in
the comi-any's rropertiF*. and it Is not un-
r> .is "r.atie to expect that as many more will
ccme to light as the properties are developed.

Sixty-three million barrels of oil. ap
proximately, were produced In the United
States last year. California's large In-
I creade advanced the total appreciably.
[The %alue of all petroleum taken from
I wells* In this country In 19M 13 estimated
at JTS.OOO.MW In round figures. At Iea3t
9.000,000 barrels more may be set down to
the record of 1900 than could be boasted
by the preceding year. The Appalachian
district, which includes New York. Penn
sylvania, West Virginia and part of Ohio,
produced 36,500,000 barrels. The Lima oil
fields of Ohio and Indiana may be cred
ited with nearly 22.000.000 barrels. Colo
rado, Kansas, .Texas and Wyoming to
gether make up 1.5CO.00O or so. Texas hav
ing a score of 800.000 and Colorado 500.00O.
In no part of the country have develop
ments had the same significance as in
California, because of the price of coal a3
fuel on the Pacific Coast.
The Standard Oil Company Is engaged
in. laying pipe lines in the Kern River
district. CoincidentaJly the Producers'
Association is beginning to do business,
with the purpose of handling all the oil It
can control through one channel as a
means of sustaining prices.
'The oil '.men throughout the State- ara
watching the developments commercially
In the -Kern River field. A report ia sent
out from JBakersfield that offers have been.
made to pay an advance over previous
prices of 5 cents as a result of the forma
tion of the Producers' Association. Com
panies are being urged to join tho asso
ciation, and many have done so. 'rue men
who are laying tne pipe line for the Stan
dard Oil company came from Ohio.
Something like 1500 oil locations wero
filed In Santa Barbara on the second day
of the. new century. Fifty persons mada
all the filings. The indications of interest
have not been confined to any locality.
Within a few days 16,0u0 acres have been
filed upon in the Cariiso Creelc section, in
San Lntgo County. Fully 73,000 acres hava
been taken up in that locality.
A mere marked Indication of confidence
in. the richness of the California petroleum,
deposits in exploited - fields has been af
forded within the past fortnight by largo
prices paid for producing properties. Ac
cording to the BakersftVtd Calif ornian the
land Involved in the Reed crude oil deal
brought $3000 per acre, the total price be
ing HS0.W0. Eastern papers are paying a
great deal of attention to California pe
troleum, which Is the subject of scores of
editorials.. .From these fact3 it appears
the interest is much wider than local and,
also that at home an appreciation of the
value of oil strikes is growing keener.
Speaking for the mineral claimants to
all lands in Southern California the Los
Angeles Herald says:
The frequent reports coming from Washing
tor, as to the attitude of Secretary Hltchcocic
of the Interior Department on thÂ» scripper
capes, and the repeated declarations that he la
likely . to render a. decision favorable to the
scrlpptra. has not caused any serious depres
sion among the oil men, who rest their case
on Its merits In the hands of officials who ar >
not presumed to be susceptible to "Influence"
nt the hands of an expensively maintained
lobby. The Intimation that tne oil men are
apathetic and careless in the matter is far
from the truth, as a close watch la kept on
every turn of the case. The authorities at
Washington are aa familiar with the various
phases of the question as are the producers
In -Kern- County or Los Angeles, and on this
fact alone the oil men base their kellef that
a decision will be rendered by Secretary Hitch
cock sustaining previous decisions on the sam~
question.
The real status of the contention between
the: oil miners and the scripp^rs, up to date,
is that the case decided by the United States
Circuit Judge. Ross, in September last, to wit.
the Cosmos Exploration Company vs. C. A.
Canfleld et al., was a complete victory for thÂ»
oil miners, the court In that case recommend
ing that the scrippers be prosecuted for the
perjuries committed in connection with their
land selections. In the case cf Aetna. Petro
leum Company vs. Henry T. Crlpps et al.. also
LÂ«fore United States Circuit Judge Roan, the
language of the court was still more strongly
!n favor of the oil men. The recent decision
by the Land Office In the case of Kern River
OH Company and C. W. Clark. Mr. Hermann's
decision was exactly in line with the decisions
of the United States Circuit Court above, be
ing also. a complete victory for the oil men.
In view of these decisions but one result Is
probable, and that against the scrippers.
A somewhat astonishing feature of the
prospecting for oil has been the discovery
of vast supplies of subterranean water,
which if properly utilized would redeem
thousands of acres of. lands not hitherto
considered to be valuable for agricultural
Eurposes. A correspondent writing from
anta Barbara tells of two failures to
strike oil in the Casitas Valley, just across
the Santa Barbara County line In Ventura
County. The fecond failure to locate oil
developed a fine artesian well, "which will
furnish water for stock upon a part of
the rancho which was fine pasture land
but lacked a good water supply." This
has been a quite common experience. In
stead of a scarcity of water In California
the oil men have discovered that in many
localities there la too much for their pur
poses. Thus, indirectly alao. the- oil men
will confer wealth on California.
Oil has been struck 600 feet off shore "at
Summerland. in the ocean, which yield3
about twenty-five barrels per day.
In Carbon Canyon, Orange County a'
well Is resolutely headed for a depth of
1500 feet. The report Is given out that
three light stratas of oil have already
been encountered. There are several firm
believers evidently in the view of Stata
Mineralogist Cooper, that far down In the
earth will be found not only a greater
supply of oil than at a shallower depth,
bat also that a finer and higher priced
quality may be reached by deeper drilling-.
A BakersfleM correspondent of the Log
Angeles Herald hoars that the Kern Oil
Company secured $1250 per acre for a large*
amount of land sold to R. C. Forum of
Michigan, the total amount Involved be
ing about $200,000.
The Tulare CHI Company complains of
having. been Jumped by the Eclipse Com
pany, and has brought an injunction suit
to' prevent. its continuing to carry on tha
work of drilling for oil. The claim \s lo
cated In section 28, 30-22. at McKittrick.
The Oakdale Leader reports that the hills
in the vicinity of. Orange Blossom colony
between Oakdale and Knights Ferry
Stanislaus County, will be prospected for
oir. '
.The Morgan Hill Times says that oil Is
9eeplr.gr out of the ground on the Schmer
ber ranch, at the Junction of Lick and
Alum Rock avenues, and there is consid
erable excitement In that neighborhood in
consequence.
The -Fotsom Telegraph says that thero
are oil indications a short distance west
of, Folsom:.
Â¦ A short distance west of Folsom the bed
rock of "slate and granite stands almost on
end, and the vast chasm cauÂ»ed when it was
urtllted has been filled with detritus by thw
eicslon of "the higher levels during countless
nfes until. the. great valley as we know it was
formed. . That there Is oil under a greater por
tion of this mass of debris there Is sufficient
evidence, .but whether it can be found In com
mercial quantities at all points Is a question
that only the drill will reveal.
Bakefsneld Californlan reports that
the operators to the northwest of tho
Kern River field have without exception
had a : great deal of trouble In getting
down owing to the strata of blue mud met
with. Â¦ necessitating much driving. Con
tinued " driving has ruined the casing. It
is now the opinion of those with the cost
ly experience that only drive pipe can be
successfully used there, and in all proba
bility most of the wells of the future will
contain it. Casing must be driven, and
drive pipe is the only kind made to stand
the strain.
â¢'In the sections where work has not de
veloped any. great field there la consider
able activity. As has been said before,
there is reason to suppose that there are
great undiscovered oil fields in the State.
Where- they -are Is the interesting ques
tion of .the time. Wells are being drilled
in â¢ Butte. . Colusa. San Benlto. Monterey.
Humboldt. Napa. Contra Costa. Marin
and other counties north of Fresno Coun
ty where. Indications are favorable. Five
concerns are working near Bradley, in
Monterey County. A company in San
B4nlto> County is down 700 feet. Attract of
11S0- acres -has been secured In Colusa
County, on Sand Creek, for exploitation.
Two wells are drilling in the- Mattole dis

I Corn vrsuf dull and narrow." The opening was
j lower on the receipts, 437 cars, and favorable
weather. The market dipped with wheat, but
recovered with that market and closed steady.
May closed VÂ»c lower at 3SVic.
. Oats were narrow. There was an excellent
cash demand. May closed a shade lower at
24W25C. l
Provisions were dull. The opening wae weak
on liberal ho; receipts and depressed prices at
the yards. Later the market recovered most
i of the loss on buying by packers. May pork
. closed sc lower. May lard and May ribs a shade
j depressed from yesterday.
I The leading futures ranged as follows:.'
CHICAGO, Jan. 11â Wheat experienced a
quiet day and restricted trade. Uny opened
U@*tÂ»c higher at Ti^iiTi^e. because Liverpool
I failed to entirely reflect the decline here yes
1 terday. . Large receipts and expectations of a
j visible increase and big world's shipments
j pressed the market down to 77@77%c during
I the first hour. A rally followed the report that
t.early all the Minneapolis flour mills would
reopen Monday. May Jumped sharply to 77%o
and closed firm at thlt price. He over yesterday.
Local receipts were eighty-seven cars, one of
contract grade. Minneapolis and Duluth re
ported 331 cars, against 310 last week and 354
a year ago.
: characteristic* which have so frequently re
; cently caused wide and excited fluctuations in
j some stock or group of stocks, which were af
| fected by some important development or a ru-Â«
roor of some development. To-day it was the j
local traction rroup. ltd by Manhattan. The j
erratic fluctuations of this stock made it evi- 1
I dent that the violence of the moment was In |
j !arge part due to the existence of a large short j
! interest, which manifested acute distress on I
1 the advance, which carried the stock up 9H
? points, with a subsequent relapse of a points.
I The sudden advance In the locai tractions was j
I taken advantage of for very heavy realizing 1
I all through the list, and when Manhattan Useir I
j save way. the whole market broke rathtr
I sharply, with the result that the closing waa
i deciaedly weak and with net losses predom-
I inatlrg over gams. The early market was j
strong and anirsated under the continuing in- 1
: fluence of the advance in the Delaware and j
, Hudson dividend and the larje and cor.cen- â¢
1 trate<i buying in that stock and others of th* j
i anthracite group. Ontario and Western opened 1
, wiae with rO.wO sharts selling at 33 to i5 l j. J
; This latter was the top price. After the real
i ixins movement, lp.vUÂ»Â»d by the opening ad- f
! ranee, the bulls ra'.lled the market and brought
i forward ntw points of strength. The coalers, j
j Union Paclflc, Baltimore and Ohio, the Gran- j
gers. Tin Plate and a number of low-priced
I railroad stocks had periods of strength. Mir.ne
j Eota and St. Louis Jumped 3 and the preferred Â¦
â¬â¢. points. - In the late realising movement the I
; steel Etocks developed special weakness oa the j
fears ot a war of competition between the I
I great powers In the trade. ;
National Tube and Steel and Wire each |
i -broke Zh,. The reaction in Delaware and Hud- j
j son waÂ« 5V National Lead dropped 6Â»Â» and ;
j American Express sold at a decline of 16 points ;
; from the last preceding sale, lt Is practically 1
I assured that -the next week will tee the be- j
> ginning of gold exports, and experts estimate j
i that tne movement will reach from 1 15.030. 000 ;
to $20,y(tf.000. It was asserted in Wait street i
I to-day that arrangement* had already been
i made for -shipment of a considerable amount I
j en next Wednesday's steamer. :
) The business in stocks the past week has
1 all previous records. Following the. Â¦
I unprecedented trade of Friday and Saturday !
I of last week, which reached the highest re- [
j corÂ£s for a full day's uading, and a Saturday
I hilf -holiday, the aggregate sale* . on Monday i
I wtre. lifted well above the I.OOO.OOi) share lev<Â«l j
! f-jf-tht first time in the history of the Sew t
r York Stock Exchnaje. Unlike the great bull I
market of two years ago, In which the newly- j
fledged industrial stocks made the bulk of the
trading, the present market is distinctly one !
of railroad stocks, and the Industrials play
an insipniflcant part. The Immediate lmpcll- I
Ing cause of the rise Is the growth of the j
"community of interests" policy among the i
railroads. The purchase of the Central Coal j
Company for the Erie, the purchase of the
Central Railroad of New Jersey for the Read-
Ing .the appearance in the Erie directorate In
community of control of interests that have
been rivals In the railroad field in the North
west, the acquirement of -St. Paul stock by;
J.- J. Hill, cf the Gr^at Northern, are the
concrete fact* from which is Inferred a general
adoption of this policy among railroad Inter
ests. Countless rumors have circulated of
other plans in process of execution, but these
are the -only well authenticated developments.
The Importance of this development as the laat
or the latest step In the rehabilitation of the '
railrpads cf the country by Insuring mainten
ance of freight rates can only be understood
by a comparison of conditions In the railroads '
with those of a few? years aso. T/hen there was :
& pretty general condition of bankruptcy ana
problem presented was complex and formida
ble. Bonded Indebtedness waa unwieldy, both Â¦
by reason of unscrupulous Inflation of capital [
issued and the hlÂ«ch cost of construction and j
material In the early periods. The construction j
was so flimsy In many cases as to keep the '
annual cost of maintenance and repair up to
a high level of expenditure. Rut* wars reach-
Ing the point of extermination bad brought the
level of freight rates down to an unprofitable
level and the structure and equipment of rail
roads made them inefficient instruments for
cheap transportation. Even the growth of
freight business attracted by the low freight
charges, therefore, co-aid not be. taken ad
vantage Of.
It Is In it* bearing on this obstinate problem
of railroad rehabilitation that the new policy
of "community of Interests" has great Im
portance. An Increase of one-tenth of 1 cent
In the average rharge for transportation of a
ton of freight one mile would incrÂ»a*Â» railroad
earnings In the conr.tr>- many millions cf dol-
Isrs every year. This is a sufficient Indication
of the advantages to railroad stockholders cf
doing away with rate cutting Â»nd rebates,
which Is believed to be assured by the trans
fuslcn of inttrestx among the competing and
connecting railroad lire*. But the fact of
speculative Inflation followed by reaction does
not alter the Impressive Improvement In con
ditions which have proved the incentive for
the speculation.
The demand for bonds baÂ« been large but by
no means commensurate with stocks. aÂ« their
level of valoe has been more accurately known
by reason cf the fixed Interest return. Unite-l
States 2s refunding advanced H PÂ«r cent over
the call price of a week ago.

NEW YORK. Jan. 12.â The Commercial Ad
vertlefr's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
NEW YORK. J,an. 12.â ThÂ« Financier says:
The New York Clearing-house banks added $11.
64S.500 to th*lr cash holdings lact week, and as
Increased reserve requirements called for only a
little over J3,500,C0O the surplus rose $8,031,973,
standing at $22 > 2P?,C.'O. which flrure is the high
est ilnce September 1 laft. prior to the beginning
of the crop movement. The gain in cash was
much larger than expected, but the source of
expansion can be traced directly to interior
remittances and receipts from the sub-terasury
en current operations. As the curr-nts of *up
rly now under way are likely to flow in this
direction for some time the inference -is that
the jurplus will be added to during the'comlnr
week*. The one poe.Â«lble cau!Â«e for a depletion
of excess reserve lies In the probability of gold
exports, but it would require a considerable
movement to- counteract the gains which the
banks are now making. Whether gold will
gr cut Is a question, but the chances at pres
t-nt are in favor of experts.' The movement
of money now is almost identical with the
opening of lust year, when the surplus reserve
of about |12,000.fÂ«0 reported during the first
r.f <>k of January rose to nearly S3J.O0O.0O0 at
the close of the month. Between January and
the second week in March, however, there was
a fall in surplus of $25.Â«fl,C0a A puzzling
feature of the statement <s the slowness with
trhlch loans are rwpondlnr to the great vol
nm* of business of the Stock Exchange. The
probabilities are that an extensive lllkldation
liaii been in process or that the trust corapa
rle* have been handling a larger volume of
business than they have been given credit for.
The expansion of $14,3$6.UO In deposits comes
frr the most part through receipts of cash.
1 he revelation of the strong position of the
New York banks under natural clndltions will
Lave a temporary effect on the money market,
although present rates are remarkably easy.
It is not likely this will check the tendency
of Interior funds to flow East, as similar con
ditions In past years have had little Influence
In thin direction.

The Victoria Dally Colonist given some
account of the Le - Roi mine, which was
mentioned in London in connection with
the sensational London and Globe failure.
The Colonist says:
The year covered by the I>e Rol accounts
extended from July 1. 1S99. to June 30, vm.
Into that year came between four and five
months ot comparative Idleness and extraordt
licry capital expenditure, which came under
many heads, such as the sinking of the perma
1 nent working shaft and its equipment with ma
chinery, the alteration of the shipping focus
from the Le Roi siding to the Black Bear sid
ing the- installation of timber framing ma
chinery. the purchase of a quarter interest ln
the smelter and the enlargement of the smelter.
All this mlglit well have been spread over two
cr three years. But the operation would pre
sumably have been one of some difficulty, as
tbe credit of ' the . controlHn* . group : has been,
to put It mildly, shaken. The mine, however,
must be In ' an excellent position now.
An electric power plant Will be erected
at Shingletown. Shasta County, about
twenty-three miles from Redding, to sup
ply mines and reduction plants ln that
vicinity. The water for .running, the
plant will; be taken from Mill Creek and
conveyed in a twenty-eight-inch steel
pipe a distance of 7000 feet, ; affording : a
pressure at the power site equal to a' fall
of 1170 feet vertically. The station equip
ment will 'be composed of three. Westing
house alternating current ! generators | of
150 horsepower output each, dlrectlycon
nectedto Pelton water wheels; making a
total output: of 4600 ; horsepower. , .'The
power thus generated will be transmitted
to - Keswlck, a â¢ distance of thirty-five
miles, to be used at -.. the . smelters ; and
mines of the Mountain Copper Company,
Ltd., and also of the Bully Hill 'mines, '
forty miles from Shingletown," which 'are
owned by Captain de la Mar. -The plant
is expected" to, be In readiness* to deliver

"We are to-night t-xtending a welcome
to one we fed we already knew. Through
fcis bocks and by the articles that he
has contributed to the magazines we come
to look u;>on him as our friend and teach
Â«?r. Through his writings we have been
helped to a better understanding of the
purpose of life and its reality. San Fran
cisco is on the extreme western point of
this continent and we hardly dared to
hope that we shouid have the privilege
of meeting and having direct teachings
from one who has a home so far away
as Mr. Loadbeater. Yet Karma has been
kind to us and has decreed this pleasure
to us. To-night we members greet Mr.
Leadbeater and our minds are eager to
learn what he may mink fit to teach us."
Mr. Leudbeater responded to the formal
address of welcome in a short yet grace
ful speech. He stated that his visit in
this city would be a. short one; that he
â¢would only remain here three weeks and
that he would try 10 be of service to
those who were In tf rested in Theot>ophy.
He said that the reception might be
turned from a social event into a more
serious and useful evening by those in
the audience propounding any questions
they might want answered and that he
would do his best U enlighten the ques
tioners. He was Immediately asked by a
lady in the audience: "Why are we unable
to "remember our former lives?"
Lcadbcattr responded by saying: "The
everage man rebels against the reincar
nation theory. People object to the theory,
vet all are anxious to hear arguments on
It. People afk. 'If we were citizens in the
early ages why cannot we remember it?'
You* cannot answer this question offhand.
But I will say at first that the reason you
cannot remember your former lives Is
that every time you re-enter the world
your soul is born ucaln. With what do
vou remember? It is with your mind.
The soul does not remember. When we
a.re a-ble to raise our common minds and
They are so deeply educated, then and only
then will we be able to retain memories
of our past lives. The mental body Is not
yet available as a vehicle. To remember
anything Is to recall that which has
taken place in our present life, that Is as
far yet as our memory is developed. 1
â¢will give you an example. When a small
boy I was in the habit of dreaming sev
eral times a. month of a peculiar temple
â¢with oddly shaped towers. I used to tell
my mother about my dreams, but I was
never quite able to understand them. In
after years while in India I met a Buddist
priest who told me when I described the
temple that in one of my former lives I
lived in that very building. . So you sec
oar minds do carry these impressions of
lonner lives, but we are not educated
enough to be able to read them."

With the steady demand at high prices the
output ol copper exceeded the great record of
1859, the total output being 615,576,80! pounds,
in comparison with 5S1.219.091 pounds in the
previous vear. These flgrures include the cop
per contents of by-product copper sulphate.
The United States once more takes flrst place
as a gold producer, owing to the suspension of
mining in the Transvaal and a decreased out
put in Australasia. The output was 3.815,435
nne ounces, valued at J7S.Â«3S,755, against 3.
3S1.196 ounces, 'valued at $70,096,021. in 1S93.
There was also refined In the United States
from foreign matter, bullion and ores, 1.9S4.
715 ounces, valued at ?4;, 057.559. Owing to good
demand and the firm control of the market by
the smelters, the production of lead shows a*
Kreat Increase and Is the largest yet recorded.
The output from domestic ores and bullion was j
251.781 short tons, as. compared with 217,085 t
short tons in 1899. There were also recovered
from foreign ores and base bullion smelted and
rÂ«:flned In this country 103.703 short tons, as
against 76,423 short tons In 1899. The output
of the quicksilver mines showed a considerable
Increase last year, the increase coming chiefly
from California. The total output was 32,315

valued at $1,155,160 In 18S9. Increased produc
tion of copper and lead caused a corresponding
increase in silver, a" large ;art of the output
being in the nature of a by-product. The to
tal output was 60,478,276 troy ounces, valued at
t37.OS5.248. This compared with 57.126.834 troy
ounces,- valued at $S4,O36,1Â«S. In .ISM. Refineries
in the United States also produced from for
eign ores and bullion in 1900 a total of 48,
25MS1 troy ounces, valued at. $28,43,219.
The Hexter mine in Calaveras County,
with 300 acres of land, Including the Caval
Flat channel of Stockton Hill, has been
deeded to John J. McSorley and others.
The mine had a plant that cost $50,000.
The Calaveras Chronicle Bays that "the
San Francisco stockholders sold the prop
erty at a price that was a cinch for the
purchasers."
A new mining venture Is under way In
Amador County. The property is on the
<*dge of Jackson and is known as the
Plenning. The company formed to work
the property has been capitalized at $300,

The Plumas Independent reports that a
survey of the Cleghorn group of claims,
on the Middle Fork of the Feather River,
Is under way, being directed by J. H.
Thomas of Oakland. Six miles of the
river will be surveyed and application will
be made for patent. The property was
formerly held by Mr. Rugg, Mr. Thomas'
son-in-law. In ISM. He was drowned
while trying to cross the river. The
: property then fell into, possession of Mc-
Clellan & Post, with whom Mr. Thomas
has made a deal.
! The Tuoiumne Independent Says that
I probably the only mill started on the first
day. of the new century in the United
States was the ten-stamp miH'at the Hope

Mention has been â¢ made In the tele
graphic news of the preliminary estimate
of the Engineering and Mining Journal
of the production of the more important
minerals and metals In the United fttates
for the year 1900. There are other facts
of general interest, however, that the
Journal has ascertained that are worthy
of brief ' review. The total value of the
metals produced' in this country last year
is estimated at 5509.800,992. *as compared
with J496.057,Â£Â» in 1S9D. The non-metallic
substances amounted to $755,680,991, as
against $645,764,305 in 1S99. The total value
for the two years, after allowing for du
plication, was, respectively, $1,157,162,182
and $1 ,049.230,594.
Aluminum is reported to be controlled
by one company, which returns an output
of 7.150J000 pounds, valued at $2,2SS,000.
Antimony Is also under one control. An
estimate is made of a total output of
3 100 000 pounds. The production came al
most entirely from the works at Chelsea,
Staten Island. Very little antimony is
mined In this country. The metal is
largely recovered from Mexican and
Japanese material. Cobalt is produced
solely in Missouri and nickel comes chiefly
from the same source â La Motte mine.
Nickel produced in this country is chiefly
from imported ore. The small output of
platinum was from Pacific Ccast ores.
The total amount was only about 173
ounces troy. Lepodolite was produced
solely in San Diego County. Statements
concerning the more important metals are
made by the Journal as follows:

I undermuslins in Hale's white goods sale. |
5 you'll find them on the second floorâ massed in billowy heaps of immaculate whiteness. Â«
Cr. A RTISTIC, refined, carefully made and comfortable, but fitly describes our splendid new stock of muslin undergarments, that ranges from inexpensive utility to costly elegance. The At
m$ Â£^ prices are low â remaikably so â but thebeauty and goodness of these exquisite combinations of fine cambrics and muslins, with the prettiest of new laces, embroideries, ribbons and jn
needlework, is the sale's greatest attraction. . The goods were made by well-paid workers in the cleanest and brightest of America's rural factories, and have nothing in common I*
kj with the undersized and improperly made garments that figure in usual sales. ' jz<^"^ A
