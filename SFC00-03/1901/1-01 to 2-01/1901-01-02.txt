saying that he expected 125 votes, in the
caucus. . The news, of the result of the
gathering was' taken to him by hts friends
and party leaders from all over the State
visited him and extended their greetings
upon what they claim is a certain victory
for stalwart Republicanism and party
regularity.
While the caucus was In session In the
House chamber a secret meeting of the
anti-Quay Republicans was held at their
headquarters at the' Commonwealth Ho

of the ar.ti-Quayltcs. binding themselves

thew Si Quay was the unani
mous choice of the joint conven
tion 6t Republican Senators and
:â¢;.': . Assemblymen | held to-night in
the House chamber to nominate a candl
j date for United States Senator. The cau
[ cus was attended by 123 legislators, or
i four less than the number necessary to
j a choice In the Joint convention of the
House and Senate, which will be held
January 6. Three of those present were
Messrs.: Hill and Tiffany of Susquehanna
j County and McPherson of Adams, who
I absented themselves from the House cau
j cus arid voted with the Democrats in the
i House . to-day; for General Koontr for
Speaker. Mr, Beaver, of : Juniata; who
voted with the stalwarts for Mr. Marshall
for Speaker, was present, but did not an
swerio his name. It was stated that he
will abide by the caucus. Thompson of
Center and Haldeman of Montgomery,
who are detained at home by illness,
were pledged by their: colleagues to Mr.
Quay. This apparently gives Mr. Quay
126 of the 127 necessary to a choice. The
| other absentees voted with the Democrats
on the organization of the House and are
classed with the Quay Republicans.
Speeches were made nominating Mr.
Quay.. Congressman John Dalzell and
Judge John G. Stewart.
On the balloting Mr, Quay received the
votes of twenty-six Senators and ninety
three members of the House. Before the
result was announced the names of
Messrs. Dalzell and Stewart were with
drawn and the nomination of Mr. Quay
â¢was made unanimous and he was thus
given a total of 123 votes. With one pres
ent and not voting and two absent on ac
count of illness, all three of whom. It is
claimed, will abide by the caucus decision.
a vote of 1^6 for Quay on Joint ballot is
indicated. As the names of certain men
who had been counted in the anti-Quay
column were called and they announced
their vote for Mr. Quay there was demon
stration of great approval on the part of
the great crowd present. The caucus did
not begin until 9:15, and speeches were so
numerous that it was not until 11:20 that
a result was reached. .
The Quay people are Jubilant over the
result of the caucus, as the number pres
ent exceeded their, expectations and they
claim that before the vote is taken on

none, perhaps, was more brtl-

Ard perhaps no-feature of it Was so uni

mistress of the White House was, able to
participate In the happy occasion, and

began to arrive,: and the long line, of arrny
and naval officers in full uniform Â¦ to the

under the glamor of myriads of electric
lights, which were reflected in the happy
faces of the shifting throng, all was bril
liancy. The- Marine Band, stationed un
der the stairway, discoursed national airs
and lively marches throughout the cere
mony.
The members of the Cabinet and .their
wives, together with the ladies of the re
ceiving party, were the first to arrive.
They laid aside their wraps in the state
dining-room and entered the public apart
ments of the President, where they ex
changed greetings with Mr. and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley. The ladies of the receiving party
entered the red and blue parlors and took
their places behind the line. Meantime
th Embassadom and Ministers of for
eign countries, with the attaches of the
various legations, in their gorgeous and
retplendent court uniforms, had gathered
in the state dining-room. ;
Promptly at 11 o'clock the bugles sound
ed the approach of the Presidential party,
andi led by Colonel Bingham. the master
of iceremonles, and Major McCauley, of

"The aspect of affairs is scarcely less
gloomy." sayg the Cape Town correspond
ent of the Times," than at the beginning
of 1900. The Invading Boers are numeri
cally fewer, but they have penetrated far
ther south and their presence in such cen
ters of hostile Dutch feeling as Graaf
Reinet constitutes an element of danger
which did not exist last January. The
proclamation calling ff>r volunteers comes
very late. The invaders have been en â¢
ahled to obtain fresh horses. All the
horses in the colony ought to have been
commandeered or bought at the first sign
of an Invasion." -
The correspondent co-nplalns of the in
ertia and reticence of the authorities.
"Letters are arriving here detailing
damage and robbery by the Invaders, anrt
asking military assistance. Any action on
the part of the colony will not abate the
â¢urgent need of large reinforcements.
"It was felt that the only means of ex
cluding the Invaders from the rich dis
tricts in the western part' of the colony
was to call out the 1 aimers. To-day'^
telegrams promise a rplendld response
from the eastern portion, but the western
is doubtful, not thirty per cent of the
population being regarded as loyal. Hence
the Boer concentration In that direction.
"The Boer invaders now number 5000.
The western Invasion gives thfe most con
cern. It has split into two divisions,
which are marchmg like the prongs of a
fork, one by way of Sutherland toward
Malmesbury and the other toward Beau
fort West. The enemy are now ranging
ever immense tracts of territory, neces
sitating the employment of an anny c-orp*.

JdIUIIS.
Two Principals in the Kidnaping of
Young Cudahy Fall In'o the
Hands of the Police.
CHADRON. Neb.. Jan. Lâ Pat Crowe,
charged with complicity in the abduction
of Edwin Cudahy of Omaha, has been
captured. ',.'â¢_/
Three detectives following Crowe's trail
came upon him to-day on the Pine Ridge
Reservation near OelrJchs, S. D.. and cap
tured him after a wild chase. Crowe was
driving a team and buckboard. He
whipped the horses and tried to outrun
the horsemen, who soon brought him to
a stop with their six-shooters. John Del
felder, a cattleman, has just reached town
with the news, and says the posse stopped
at a ranch about thirty mlies out for
lunch and to feed their horses.
Brother of the Notorious Pat Also
J. J. CSOWE IS ARRESTED.
Placed in Jail.
OMAHA. Nebr., Jan. Lâ A second arrest
in the Cudahy kidnaping case has been
made. J. J. Crowe, brother of Pat Crowe,
whom the police believe to be a principal
in the abduction, was taken into custody
in Council Bluffs to-day by Omaha de
tectives. The warrant charges Crow*
with the abduction of Edward Cudahy on
December IS. Crowe consented to accom
pany the officers across the river with
out the formality of requisition papers.
While residents of Western Council Bluffs
in the vicinity of Thlrty-fourth'street and
Broadway were in blissful ignorance that
so momentous an event as the attempted
trapping and arrest of the men impli
cated in the kidnaping was taking place,
a posse of sleuths equipped with search
warrants and complaints charging abduc
tion ransacked the premises adjacent to
J. J. Crowe's saloon In the hope of dis
covering Pat Crowe in his place of con
cealment. They had the necessary papers
for the arrest of both Pat and his brother.
Early in the day the police department
had been given the quiet tip that either
Pat Crowe was making his hiding place
in his brother's saloon . or the brother
knew a whole lot more than he would di
vulge about the kidnaping and the letter
that has been recently written to the Cud
ahys threatening the death of their son
if the reward for the arrest of the kid
napers were not withdrawn.
A diligent search disclosed no trace of
Pat Crowe, but the officers carne upon
the brother asleep in a rear room. They
hastily awakened him and took away two
huge bulldog pistols which he carried In
his pockets. The man was first taken to
the Ccuncil Bluffs police station by De
tective Weir of the Iowa Department and
then he was conducted across the river
for an examination by Chief Donahue. â¢
When the information that Pat Crowe
might be found in the saloon was given
to Chief Donahue he detailed Detectives
Donahue. Heittelt. Savage. Dunn and
Dempsey to make the arrest. These offi
cers secured the co-operation of Detective
Weir. As Judge Aylesworth. before whom
complaints must be sworn, was confined
to hi3 -house by illness, the officers wera
compelled to go to the Judge's dwelling
to secure the necessary papers. A com
plaint charging J. J. Crowe and Pat
Crowe witlf being fugitives from Justice
through implication in the Cudahy kid
naping In Omaha was sworn out by De
tective Dempsey. The warrants were
placed in the hands of Detective Weir.

The San Francisco Call
rr w y ASHINGTOX, Jan: 1.â One of the early achievements of
. \^./\ / the new century will be a new White House; or, rather,
Vy Vy such extensive additions to the present structure that it
V:. "!y ' will practically be new. The plans for this palace of

The plans provide for two buildings, one to be erected on the east
and another on the west, each of these being about the same size, as
the present mansion, and connected with* 1 , it 'by curved wings. The
.quadrangle will be completed by rebuilding the conservatories on
,the south end of the grounds. ' W-/
;. In detail the new White House will be rich. The main columns
jwill be fluted. The basement will be of ; granite and the walls of
concrete; and marble, inclosing a steel framework. At the west end
the large room will be suitable for a state dining-room, capable of
seating more than 200 guestsi The end building- will probably /be
used as a kitchen and storehouse/ In the east and west additions
provisions have been made for the reception of a large number of
guests, with all the necessary details of dressing-rooms and ward
robes. On the second story at the west end will be a suite of six
bedrooms and four bathrooms. At the east end of the second story
are six additional rooms intended for offices. The new work on the
White House will cost $1,100,000, including partial furnishing.

Â¦Â¦ After th.fr. receiving party had taken,
iheir places the* long line of guests began
;. to move; first in the line came the Em
bassadors -.-and Ministers from' .foreign
courts, accompanied by their full staffs.
'.. At: their ;head was the venerable and
dignified Ik>rd PaunceiV.e. 1 British Em
bassador and. Dean of; the - Diplomatic
Corps, in the full, uniform of his high
diplomatic ; rank. . With ihim were Lady 4

Emba66ador: M. Cambon, the.French Em
basaador; Count Casslnl, rthe'Russian Em
bassador, and Qenor Don Azplroz, the
Mexican Embassador, . <;ach accompanied
by his staff and ladies. -The French Em
bassador returned only last night from
Paris, having ccme on at this time to ex
tend to the President the felicitation. of
the New Year. The Chinese Minister. ,ln
line silks, and Mme. Wu, in an elaborate
gown, attracted much attention.
After the Embassadors and Ministers
came the Chief Justice and Associate Jus
tices of the United States Supreme Court,
the Judges of the Court pf Appeals, Senat
tors and Representatives In Congress, for
mer Congressmen and Ministers of the
United States. As the guests now began
to move from room to room of the spa
cious mansion a scene of beauty and bril
liancy met the eye. From the state din
ing-room the guests passed into the red
parlor, whtre the rich red furnishings,
tapestries and walls were set off with a
wealth of foliage and flowers. Along tho
mantel were ranged the: fragrant red be
gonia and faming poinsfttia, while below
the. central chandelier arose superb clus
ters of Arrierlean Beauty roses, and or
chids. Th>'liHie room was the center of
attention, for here the Presidential party
received, surrounded by: the members of
the -Catilnet : and their ladlw and those In
vited to assist In receiving. â¢ â¢ .

President. J. H. Raymond of the' Board
of Health has mado the startling state
ment that the new Chinatown, which has
grownup since the old district In which
Orientals dwelt was burned. Is as dirty
and.unhealthful as was the old China
town, which was held responsible for the
visitation of vtbe plague. The new quar
ters in which the Chinese and Japanese
live are not far\from the old Chinatown.
They have. been rapidly built up to ac
commodate the thousands -who were with
out homes. '' In a few months, according
to Dr. Raymond, the new Chinatown has
become filthy and;he result of his warn
ing will be a clean up.
C. H.-W. Norton, who left here on the
steamship Mlowera last week, is said to
have $600,000 of McBryde plantation stock
to float Norton 1$ a large McBryde stock
holder and It' Is reported here that one
of the purposes of his trip to the coast
is the placing- of tha* bonds.
United States Judge Estee has decided
the appeal in' the case of the owners of
the lost barkentlne* William Carson
{â¢gajnst the Wilder Steamship Company in
fav6r or the plaintiffs on every point
This' means that the defendants will have
to pay 'for the sinking of the William
Carson fast December in collision with the
Wilder steamer Claudine.
District Attorney Balrd has received or
ders to proceed against the alleged trusts
in Honolulu. The agreement of local
merchants that they would not deal -with
drummers from the mainland is one of the
propositions he will look Into. There has
been much agitation, here about an alleged
plumbers' trust and other . combinations
of local : wholesale dealers to shut out
competition, and Baird is investigating
the matter. '
The Coroner's juries In the cases of
Scout Bennett and Miss Schneider., the
young -lady whose death Is supposed to
have "caused Bennett's suicide, nave ren
dered-verdicts. In Bennett's case there
was no doubt of suicide, but the Jurors
â¢were not able to declda how Miss Schneid
er secured the poison that killed her.
They returned a verdict that she came to
her death by poison administered by par
ties unknown. .
Single tax is another legislative experi
ment that may be trl<?d herÂ© In the near

The new steamship Sierra had a bad
passage. Captain Ho'.nllette reports hav
ing encountered the worst weather be
has seen in 'many years on the Pacific.
A .considerable quantity of passengers*
baggage and other freight waa damaged
by the water.
The Porto . RIean laborers were trans
ferred from \he steamship Rio Janeiro to
inter-Island steamers and taken at onco
to Lahaina. Maul. They are to work on
the Pioneer Mill Company plantation.
On the steamship "Warrimoo to-day
ninety-six Portuguese from Nejsv Bedford,
Mass., arrived. They were taken to a
Kaiial plantation.
. The storm that created havoc In San
Francisco on the 14th ct this month was
severely felt by steamers between here
and the coast. The City of Rio de Janeiro
from San Francisco, Warrimoo frmn Van
couver and transport Logan all had very
bad weather. The Rio arrived a day late,
and the Wanirrioo two days. On both
vessels the passengers were confined be
low for four or five Â«lay3 while speed was
slowed. The Rio's pumps "gave out and
for a time she was In serious trouble.
"With four pumps disabled the water below
Â¦washed In from the dÂ«*cks> so rapidly that
many of the firemen d^Ffrted their posts.
The chief engineer restored order below
by getting thfÂ» fifth pump to work.
"The planters have had great difficulty
in settling the labor question. "We have
found Japanese unreliable and have ex-*
perimented with Italians and Portuguese.
The Porto Rlcan business is an experi
ment, and if the laborers brought here
prove to be good we shall send for more." j
"We have not yet received full details
as to the terms on which the men were
secured, but I understand they are to re
ceive $15 or $16 per month, with the usual
addltionals, such as homes, medical at
tendance, etc.. provided. Why it is that
there shpuld be such opposition to their
coming here I do not know, but I under
stand that there were agents out to meet
them on their way from New Orleans as
far . from San. Francisco , as El Paso,
Texas, and that efforts, were made to
make the laborers discontented by gross
ly misrepresenting the facts to them. It
looks like a deliberate attempt to injure
these inlands. The laborers will cer
tainly be: better off here than they ever
were in their Porto Rlcan homes. There
.is nothing here like .the miserable condi
tions in which most of them lived at
home.
HONOLULU. Dec. 25.â Fifty-six of the
134 Porto Ricans who started here to take
places as plantation laborers arrived here
on the 22d, and are now on the Island of
Maul, where their future home is to be.
To the Associated Press, Secretary
Pfotenhauer of the Hawaiian Planters-

ment regarding the employment of these

FIFTY TOMS OF CANDY
Have Been Sent to Our Soldiers in tha
'-*Â¦}â¢ Philippine Islands by the Got-
ernment
Fifty tons of candv have been sent to
the soldiers In the Philippine Islands by
thÂ« commissary department of the army
duHng the last three months? and lar^e
amounts to the soldiers In Cuba and Porto
Rico.
This is done upon advice of the medical
officers of the army, because it is a phy-
siological fact that a moderate consump-
tion of confectionery promotes health an'l
satis-fles a natural craving of the stomach
Candy was never furnished to the
United States army before, although it
has been commonly us*d as a ration by
the French and "British troops in tha
tropics.
This explodes another old-fashioned
theory that sweets v.ere injurious to the
disresttve orsans. while n moderate use of
sweets is actually beneficial. â¢
Very few thinjes are injurious and the
food cranks who advocate thÂ« use of a
few pralns and vegetables and d^cry th<?
use of sweets and meats are in error, as
a Â¦wholesome variety of meat and vege-
table food is absolutely necessary fnr th<rÂ»
maintenance of tho hijrfiest condition of
health. j
Th<Â» best rate to fcIToxv Is to e,if whaÂ»
the appetite crave?, and if there is anv
discomfort or trouble Â»n diffiÂ»sflnc mÂ«Â»Vt
and sweets the difficulty can be -readily
, overcome by the rei*cular use after m^aH
of some safe digestive composed of pep-
sin and diastase . which will assist the
stomach by increasing the flow of jrastrie
juice and furnish the natural peptona
lar-klnp In weak etPmachs.
The best preparation of this kind Is
probably Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet?
which may be found at all drug- stores. 2
Years of use hare demonstrated the
valuo and effectiveness, of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets in all cases of impaired
digestion.

gambling game in question, they are do
ing only what scores of other gamblers
are allowed- to rlo without molestation
On the other hand, the police maintain
that the defendants have long continued
to permit minors to frequent their resort,
despite repeated warnings, and that this
pernicious practice was the direct cause
or their arrest. - :

PASADENA. Jan. Lâ Throughout all
Southern California this flrst day of tho
century was known as "Pasadena day."
For twelve years on the flrst day of each
Dew year a floral parade has attracted
to the Crown of the Valley not only thou
sands of residents or tnta and neighbor-
Ing cities and towns, but tourists from a!l
over the country as well, drawn by tho
marvelous tale of flower-bedecked ve
hicles and a battle of roses in midwinter.
From a very beautiful yet modest parado
the first year the rose carnival grew until
three years ago so large had the affair
become that florl3tsÂ« estimated that therÂ«s
were more than thirty tons oZ giiwcrs
used In the decorations of the vehicles
In the parade.
From the flrst parade in 1SS9 until tho
present day there has not been an un
pleasant or stormy New Tear's day. a
fact which speaks volumes for the cli
matic conditions of Southern California.
To-day the weather was ideal. At an
early hour the crowds began to arrive
and until the parade started at 10:20 every
steam and electric car from Los Angelts
and surrounding towns was filled with
the incoming throng. Every point of
vantage was occupte'.l by sightseers. On
the foundations of a new building belns
erected at the corner of Fair Oaks avenue
and Colorado street seats for SCO peopi>Â»
had been erected and every seat was oc
cupied. Along the curbs stood thousands
watching the beautiful and >aleldoscopie
picture as the parade passed in review.
Two immense grandstands on Orange
Grove avenue, at the comer of California
street, were filled to overflowing and mosr
of the occupants had either bunches oi
flowers or bags flUtd with rose petals and
confetti for use in Hie floral battle. Thou
sands of carriages occupied side streets
and vacant lots.

discovered Feeney's body in the lake,
where it had been buried under the ice.
Feeney's skull had been crushed, his
throat cut, and his body had been loaded
by -wefg-hts fled around it. These had
evidently become detached, and the body
came to the surface after the ice
broke up.
Feeney not returning: to his home and
work at ChippeTva, the mill owners sent
men to hunt for him. but no trace of
him could be found, and nothing was
known until his body was found by the
old trapper.
Keency's brother, who was a resident
cf New York, offered a large reward for
the apprehension of the murderers, but
the crime was never fastened upon*any
one.
Mr. Elliott concludes his letter by say
ing that at that time he was a- telegraph
operator at Fanvell. Michigan, three
miles from where this murder took place.

An' amusing criticism concerning two
artists well known in California appeared
the other day in a Chicago paper. Jules
Mersf elder, whose work is well enough
known here, perpetrates the criticism and
Jules Pages is the aitlst criticized. Al
most Inevitably it Is a study from the
nude that is the subject of the.unfavor
able comment- Mr. Mersfelder thus de-'
livers himself:
"The life-size nude painting by Jule?
Pages, called .'The Model's Toilet, is not
an elevating picture to be placed before
the refinement of this country. We do not
need pictures . of this standard to culti
vate the tastes in a hish artistic direc
tion. It is true. that we must draw and
f>aint from the nude in crder to progress
n art. hut until one U competent to por
tray it in a beautiful or poetical manner.
It should be withheld from the public
view. If Mr. Pages will paint the nude,
let him select, a higher .. type, of - a model
and treat It with a refinement of a Bou
geureau or a ' CablneL"
But the artist certainly, got what he had
waited for. The exhibition was one of tho
best ever seen here. Large crowds saw
the pictures and as before said, many
pictures were sold. The best efforts of
the local artist were to be seen, and
though names like Keith, Matthews and
Joullin were missing from the catalogue
an excellent showing was made. Natu
rally the artist will go where he can sell
his work, and; the comparative financial
results of the two Important exhibitions
of the year- indicate the wisdom of his
choice. â¢ The real center of artistic activ
ity in the town, in spito of limited quar
ters, a limited though essentially useful
public and a limited ueriod of time to de
vote to the service of art, is undoubtedly
the Bohemian Club;, and, though it Is
to be regretted that the nominal center ol
art interest, the Hopkins Institute falls
somehow short of the need. It is well for
the town that the work is belne done,
and done in such a capable and effective
fashion as the recent exhibition illus
trates.
Amone the many remarkable features
of the late Bohemian Club exhibition of
paintings, the unusual number of pictures
sold Is not least remarkable. Though thÂ«
club ethics forbid a published list of sales,
it is well understood that almost every
artist-exhibitor waa the financial gainer
by his exhibit. It was not for nothing
that the best work was reserved for th*
Bohemian exhibition, that the Mark Hop
kins gallery made so poor a showing this
year, and that even the Sketch Club cli
entele made ineffective sacrifice of their
autumn harvest,- in hope of the emolu
ments and glory of tnis! popular exhibi
tion. And the latest (dictate of ungallantry
bars the woman-artist from the walls
of tho club!

SHAFROTH'S IRRIGATION BILL.
SHAFROTH of Colorado has introduced into
the House of Representatives a bill providing
"for the construction of reserv6irs in the aril
land States, and for the disposal of the public lands
reclaimed thereby." It has been referred ta the Com
mittee on Public Lands, and while it is not likely to
be adopted at this session, it will serve the purpose
of bringing the irrigation problem definitely before

0 COMPARISON OF PRICES.
TT^v EPORTS from Washington give a summary of
L_vf ' -a publication issued by the Royal Statistical
H Â¦' : -\ Society of Lqndon. showing a comparison of
prices .in 1899 with t4iose of preceding years. The
statistics are the work of Professor Sauerbeck. The
statement of values is in the form of index numbers in
which the average price during the period from 1867
to 1877 is .taken as 100 and the relative price in the
yecrs fiaraed;from 1880 to 1H99 is based thereon. The
price? ojjiorty-nve; articles are computed, but they
are arrarijred in six groups: vegetable food, animal
food, ffugar, coffee and tea, minerals, textiles, and
sundry njaterials: !;md in the summary that comes to

articles separately. ;

101; for 1885, 88:; for; 1890, 82; in 1896 again the low

has also been given at various figures as
follows: By Humboldt. 17.375 feet; Mex
ican Scientific .Commission. 17.664 feet:
Ferrer. 17,879 feet; Kaska, 1S.270. In 1S92
Scovllle and Bunsen established a base
line of 1,500 feet at the 13,000-foot level
and took angles upon the summit. Their
result was 13,312 feet. The year before
these surveyors carried a line of spirit

WALKING FISHESâ Subscriber. Oak
land. Cal. There is a genus of fishes com
monly called walking fishes. They are the
ophicephalus, belonging to the family
anabasldea. These fishes are peculiar to
Asia. They are called walking fishes be
cause of their habit of traveling across
land. During drought they burrow in the
mud. Their habitat Is in the fresh water
shallows near the shore. They are pro
vided with an accessory chamber which
retains water. They breathe air and are
able to remain out of water for a lone?
time. They die it they breathe water too
long. There are about thirty species of this
lish, which are found in the fresh waters
of the East Indies and Africa.

Â¦' The' Journal Amusant, of Paris, having heard of ulÂ«j ,reat success of
Mme. Bernhardt and M. Coquelin in New York, and being uncertain as to
whom the greater credit belongs, solves the dilemma by presenting a com
posite portrait of the two famous players.
Of late years there has been much discussion con
cerning the position in ourieducalional work of what
is called "the small college." By; the term is meant
institutions like the. University di{ the Pacific, which
in former years woujd have been." accounted the pride
cf their communities; but ; which, of late have been
overshadowed by large universities on whom States
and millionaires have lavished so. much of wealth that
in point of buildings, equipment, and students they
now rank among the! greatest Of the world; It is ai
question over which, authorities differ; but the public
will give'little heed to/the controversy, for it is kriowri
that in this country there is room and need for botJn
Some of our best and most whblesome training, has
been developed in the smallest and it will
beiso to the end of time. '.>'â¢. ' '. ,
For every purpose it has in view the University of
the Pacific is ideally located. It! stands in a cultured
community surrounded by other educational institu
tions, such as Santa Clara College, the State Normal
School at San Jose, the Notre Dame College for girls
the College of Our Lady of Angels, Mount Hamilton
Observatory and Stanford University; while within
a few hours' ridelis San Francisco. Under such favor
ing conditions, the university being now freed from
debt ought to flourish and augment in power and use
fulness. It represents the highest educational efforts
oHone of the great churches oi[ the community and
can surely count upon the members of that church
for the support needed to maintain it and advance it
for all time to come. ,
We can hardly have too many colleges in Califor
nia, and it would indeed be a matter of deep regret it
we should lose even the smallest of those whose ex
istence dates froni the days of the* pioneers and gives
to our educational system a historic continuity from
the foundations of the State dowij to this time. â¢ The
University of the Pacific is the oldest college of liberal
arts on the coast, having been founded in 1851. It is
therefore a monument of what the pioneers of .Cali
fornia aimed at even in those early years, and, is a
proof that among the men who came here were many
who .did not come merely to get gold; but came to
make homes for themselves and their children, and to
lay; the foundations, of a great .American common
wealth. What other purpose could they have had m
view when; they contributed to Ahi establishment of
aniinstitution Jike the University of the Pacific anjf
dedicated it to the cause of higher education? :
ONE of the gratifying announcements of. the
holiday season is the report that the Uni
..;..' versity of the Pacific has been freed from. the
burden of debt that rested upon .it; and being now as
sured of the permanence of a well established institu
tion, begins the new century with the prospect of soon
obtaining liberal endowments. 'Â¦*'Â¦'.'Â¦

In the use which Is made of it and in
its effect upon the Individual. It Is wicked

sinful to endanger one's health, and im
purity is a sin beyond any question.
Dancing Is or 1$ not harmful Just to the
extent to which it leads to any of these
results. That is a matter for the indi
vidual conscience and cannot be settled
for people in masses, as the early klng3
used to order out companies to be bap

denominations are coming to this funda

ments. The progress Is not as rapid as
some eager souls would like to see It, but
it is fast enough to distress many con
servatives who were brought up under
hard and fast rules for right and wrong.

labor to support lifejthan ever before, but with the_
increase of comfort and education there has arisen
among civilised 'men a demand:' -for a higher level
of living than irr former times, and consequently the
strain and the struggle in the social competition has
not been in any wise diminished: Â¦â¢
â¢â¢The present generation of men are not to be per
nÂ»itted-.:to use the present generation of trees and de
stroy all future generations of trees. That is all. En
lightened economists r.nd intelligent lumbermen are
agreed upon this. The good old days of ruthless
slaughter of forests are passing away. Snd the Gov
ernment by reservation of the forests and permitting
their commercial use under proper regulations will
draw a permanent revenue from their reservation, and
future generations of men will have future crops of
timber for their use enjoyment.
Reservation of the forest land does not mean, as
Judge Spencer seems to think, that economic use
of timber shall be denied. It means that such use
shall be permanent, by making the forests permanent.
It means that all timber shall be cut tor commercial
use; when it is; fit for such use. but that in cutting it
the crop that is coming on shall not be destroyed, but
left to grow, ripen, be cut and used: In its turn, to
make room for the crop that will follow it.
Heretofore the processes of the American lumber-'
man have been* destructive. In harvesting a crop of
timber !that. is ripe for the ax and saw he ; has ruth
lessly destroyed all ; future crops of timber on the
same ground. . The truth of this statement may be
seen in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, that
vast pitie region which supplied the lumber and tim
ber-to build the shelter of the .many millions of peo
ple who live in the upper Mississippi Valley. That
forest: that extended fiom the Maumee to; the Lak;
of the .Woods grew in a soil; adapted to-the pro
duction' of the white pine, white cedar, tamarack and
ether conifers. The lumbermen began at: its edges
and filled, ' Sawed and burned as they' went. They
cut the ripe crop and by fire destroyed its generations
of. successors. They were as improvident as would
be an 'orchard owner who would cut down his peach
and apple trees to pick their first crop.
Then preservation of forests for the conservation
of moisture and their good effect upon climate is no
longer an academic question. It is demonstrated.
So,!! too, their preservation for economic reasons re
lated to the permanent commercial value of their con
stant crop of timber is demonstrated.
On the other han1, where the forest is preserve-i
below the snow line the water, flows into the soil held
in place by the trees, is protected by the forest floor
and is delivered through springs and .streams that
have^ a steady and permanent run-off.. 'Â¦Â¦'.
This .is a strange error in regard to the forest
function below the snow line of high mountains. The
forests hold the soil in place, restrict evaporation and
prevent the : .water from the melting snow becoming a
torrent,. If Judge Spencer will study tracts that have
been stripped of timber, and have been burned over
so often that no roots nor forest floor remain, he
will find that, the soil has slipped away, leaving the
bare, rocky, ribs of the mountain, over which the
water flows -in torrents, flooding the streams tem
porarily and leaving them to dry up when the flood
ceases: : ."Â¦Â¦Â¦ :.. i
JUDGE! SPENCER of Susanvilfe in a letter to
~\ The Call attacks the policy of fdrest reservation'
and denies that forests are a factor in the con
servation of mQisture. He says, on the latter point:
"The people of Northern California have only to look
up to purgrand old Shasta to see that huge drifts of
eternal snow looking down upon them are above the
timber line, while the great forests around its base
are not only, destitute of snow, but present a most
balmy and delightful atmosphere." 'Â¦

In regard .to the missionaries and their
position in China, Mr. Goodnow thinks
there is still a great field for successful
work, and their continued presence In the
Orient should be encouraged. He, how
ever, is of the opinion that It would not
be best to send missionaries outside "the
treaty ports until peace has been pro
claimed., ,
."I believe a' satisfactory settlement will
be reached along the lines laid down by
the President. Those Chinese who are
working for the integrity of their country
are friendly toward the United States and
are ready to assist in a prompt and ami
cable settlement. The uprising was by
no means a popular move- with the great
mass of the peaceable Chinese population.
From the very first they deplored the acts
of their fellow countrymen. '

wherei he was one of the most active

SOLDIERS HAVE
PLEASANT TIME
New Year's day brought to the soldiera
at the Presidio plenty of good cheer, tur
key and plum. pudding galore and numer
ous visitors.' , Many of the men from the
barracks and hospitals were "out on
pass." coming downtown to make their
share of the noise. . ;:.-Â«
â¢It was "a busy clay at Post Hospital.
Doctors and stewanls were kept busy all
day dressing the wounds of more than a
score of soldiers who had spent New
Year's eve partaking of eggnOg and other
stimulants and met with the same fate
as many of their civilian brothers.
The- most serious case was that of Mon
tezuma Ward, who reported at the hos
pital."with an ear hanging by a shred of
flesh. He claimed to have fallen down
the stairs leading to his quarters.
The patients from the Grant were all
taken from the transport and reached the
General Hospital Jn time to partake of
the good cheer. Kind-hearted ladles of the
Red Cross and representatives of the com
mittees having charge of the Christmas
festival were in and cut the wards during
the day, giving to each of the. late" ar
rivals a Christmas present. The sick bovs
in blue were greatly pleased to know that
though they arrived a little late for the
celebration proper they were not for
gotten.
Robert Gardman of the Thirty-fifth In
fantry did not live to see the birth of the
new year and century. Dread dysentery
carried him off. his death being the only
one unpleasantness occurring at the post.

There was no dissatisfaction over the
manner in which they were handled by
Tommy Lottridge. The latter trainer al
ready had more than he could attend.
It Is reported that "Monk" CoburnÂ«.in
tends starting for New Orleans, where he
thinks It might be easier to shine Jn the.
saddle. The judges-at Oakland decided
that the contract held by Atkin & Lott
ridgo on ti.e services' of "Monk" was a
valid one. The New Orleans Association
is a member of the American Turf Con
gress, and beyond Question will uphold
the ruling of the Oakland officials.
O'Connor' and Turner were twice past
the Judges on winners. . .
In the last race, Trevathan fell opposite
the paddock and rolled over little Web
ster. The boy escaped with a shaking up,
but the horse's neck was broken. s He
was a. four-year-old gelding by imp. Baa

THE mighty crowd of new century
sport lovers that overflowed the
immense grandstand at Oakland
track yes'tercny. trampled the
lawns and made ingress and
egress to and from the betting ring al
most an Impossibility, eclipsed any pre
vious gathering in the history of the Cali
fornia Jockey Club.. Ten thousand people
and perhaps more, which included a gen
erous sprinkling of the fair sex, resplend
ent in holiday fixings and finery, mada
; merry, exchanged Xew Year greetings
and Just by way of divertisement "backed
the ponies 1 ' a little. Not to make a gam
ble of ft, the sedate business man said,
but Just to have an interest In the game.
Xo day could have been set apart more
perfect for the purpose. The sun shone
brightly. It was not warm enough for
parasols, neither was it weather that
called for the tcp coat. . With an exquisite
programme of six events and a lightning
fast track to run over, there is no wonder
that the .magnificent lacing witnessed
whetted- the appetites cf all for more.
Favorites did not all win, or come near
it, for that would not do on an occasion
of this sort. The once-in-a-while turf
goer always likes to trail with the outsid
er, and these latter were 'as plentiful aj
the -flowers in May yesterday.
Of all the choices. Golden Cottage, win
ner of the first kindergarten event of the
year, was the only successful one. SHU,
these disasters caused small grumbling-,
simply because Advance Guard, the iron
son oi Great Tom, captured the rich New
Year handicap.
Naturally the handicap, which was over
one mile and a furlong, calling out a Held
of ten starters, evoked all Interest. ! N\>
horse in California Is more popular than
Advance Guard, and although beaten re
peatedly, the chestnut" colt has always
shouldered his unreasonable imposts and
fought it out to the finish. He was not
favorite in the betting, being held a 3 to
1 chance, but with O'Connor up, carried
more support than the Jennings pair, An
drisa and Vesuvian, allpted 114 and 122 re
spectively.
The balance of the starters looked out
of their element, unless it was Malay.
After three numbers had been run oil,
the starters for the handicap were called.
There was little delay at the post, Domi
nick on Uaviland incidentally spoiling one
start, which cost him $100 and three days.
That is, unless Mr. Caldwell relents. Sent
away to an excellent break, .Mort
gage was first past the sta'.fd, then -The
Fretterand Haviland. . Uefore the far
turn had been reached, Bullman had
taken the leading position with. The. Fret
ter, Haviland trailed in second place, and
Andrisa, piloted by Jenkins, was swinging
in their wake. Once started for home,
Jenkins and Andrisa passed the laboring
Fretter. and the stable's backers began to
cheer. On from fifth place, Advance
Guard came thundering along under
O'Connor's furious urging and at the pad
dock had Jenkins resorting to the whip.
Andrisa endeavored io respond, but the
mare's old enemy gradually gave her the
laugh again, winning by two lengths in
1:6S& When it looked dark for Andrisa,
Mounce tried all he knew to bring. Vesu
vian to the rescue, but went Â¦ to pieces,
though finishing a good third. O'Con
nor was tendered a veritable ovation as
he rode back to the stand with Advance
Guard and entered the winner's circle.
The baby racers entered in the first
two-year-old event or the year, a
three-furlong dash, attracted much at
tention. Golden Cottage, a superbly
furnished bay colt by imp. Golden Garter
from Pink Cottage, had been highly tried
and with O'Connor in the saddle went to
the poet a 7 to 5 choice. Carlo, Dorlne
and Evander were also extensively
touted. No recall flag was used, a
pretty start being accomplished in short
order. Golden Cottage at once went to the
front and after shaking oft! Prestano was
challenged by Dorlne. In a long, hard
drive the favorite secured the decision by
a nose, reeling off the distance in 36 sec
onds. Evander, the Â¦ stable mate of
Prestano. came from - behind, securing
third place. .
In. the introductory mile selling run,
Astor, the opening favorite, won from
start to finish. Alaria, backed to 5 to 2
favoritism, led Monrovia out a length for
the place.
Everybody was guessing as to whether,
or not Tom Ryan had The Pride ready.
Finally St. Cuthbert was heralded as the
real thing and came out a 3 to 4 chance
for the second event, a six-furlong spin.
Jenkins waited with the favorite to make
his ride when Turner on The Prido did.
It was a mistake, for the latter horse pos
sessed the most speed, winning out by two
lengths. Ralston, a 10 to 1 shot, was
third.
Mr. Brooks turned out a difficult one in
the Berkeley handicap, at six furlongs.
Eight fast ones accepted the weights and
against Pat' Morrissey, the first choice,
13 to 5 could be had. Pat started to make
the running, but his reign was of short
duration. Buchanan hustled True Blue
into front position and had the race in
hand, when Turner came with a well
timed rush on Headwater, scoring a noso
on the wire. . Â¦ . . .
Winnie O'Connor's desire to draw close
finishes lost the closing mile and a six
teenth Belling affair for Dr. Bernays, the
favorite. J. Daly, with the leg up on Op
ponent, sneaked away from the bunch in
the stretch, reaching the line a nose be
fore the choice. MorJnel played In awful
racing luck.

event by default,' -Russell &Â¦ Allen's Wed

contest for final honors, being withdrawn.
This victory adds another to the long list
of Emin Pasha, as 'the sire of stake win
ners. Risky reached the bottom of- the
can! by fast, snappy v.ork and in all; his
courses led his opponents well to the hare.
AVoduing Boils is' deserving of credit for
her show of determined coursing In her
effort to reach first place.
In' contrast to the runups of. Risky. At
tf-rnpt. Bolls had to overcome the lead
gained on each instance by the hounds
wlUi which she. was contesting. Not once
d:4 she get a point for speed, but her
ptrong persistency told in her favor and
pained her the decisions. She was more
than kind to the Fh;ort end players who
backed her. At 5 to 3 she beat Warrigal
In the first and followed by outpointing
the fast Royal Union, Who was quoted a
6 to 1 favorite. In the fourth round she
killed LJone Fide's chances in a close score
nt odds of 4 to 1, but her next go proved
her undoing. Little Sister was her op
jionent, but gave her little assistance in
the hard run and was beaten. â¢ McCombs'
f.ier should have been withdrawn, for In
the previous round she had a course se
vere enough to take the spirit from any
hound. Sister was the best greyhound in
the event and was favorite for the stake.
Dona Fide showed up in great form, do
ir.p; faster and better work than for some
time. She led Wedding Bells well in the
fourth, but lost by a. point.

The n^TinÂ»i dinner of the Corinthian

white Jackets and caps were discovered
on tha stage carving the turkeys, duck?,
suckling pigs and other good things. The
dismembered birds were handed round t>>'vÂ»i*
the members of the Cooks' and Walters' VÂ» *

three minutes' duration, acquitted them*
selves admirably.
After appetites had been sated. Com
modore' H. I>. Hawks addressed the mem
bers, especially commending Port Captain
John H. Keele for his zeal in managing
the entertainments of the club. Ex-Com

characteristic speech, full of home- thrusts
at well-known members of the club.
After the Edna Quartet had sungr
"Sweet Kentucky Babe," Commodore
Hawks referred to the foundation of the-
Vallejo Yacht Club, to which Commodore
"W. J. Woods replied by presenting to tho
Corinthians a handsome silk pennant of
the Vallejo Yacht Club and Inviting all
Corinthians to make themselves at honaa
at Vallejo. C. Montealegre recited a poem
written by Peter Robertson of the Bo
hemian Club, and Slgnor AbrainofC ren
dered two songs In a. brilliant manner.
After "Fancy"' Thornton had spokan a
few â¢words. ex-Commodore Carl wester
feld expatiated on the charms of yachting
in San Francisco Bay. "Undo George"
Bromley and ex-Commodore L. B. Chap
man broujrht the speech-making to a
close. Then the toast of "Absent Mem
bers'* was given by the commodore, ana
several songs whlled away the. time until
It was necessary to start for tho ferry
boat. '
The dinner was tho most successful ever
given by the club, being the first annual
one to be held in the greatly enlarged
clubroom, which was Just comfortably
filled. The room was freely decorated
with signal and prize flags, and the man
telpiece was crowded with handsome sil
ver trophies won by the sloops Aeolus.

At the back of the stage was an array
of new tin pans and culinary utensils,

NEW YEAR LEVEE
OF MacARTHUH
Americans and Filipinos
Meet Together in So
cial Function.
The use of carriage numbers was not
understood by the coachmen and much
confusion occurred outside.
MANILA. Jan. 1.â If Fresident McKin
ley's New Year's reception proves greater
than that of General MacArthur it will
not be the fault of the' people of Ma
nila. This reception was the first official
social function at which the Americans
and Filipinos have mingled in a social
way. For three "hours a stream of vehi
cles wound through the grounds of the
Governor GeneraFs residence tind dis
charged their callersâ official and civilian
âmost of them natives, though there was
a sprinkling of foreigners. The American
flag, branches of nipa flowers and vines
predominated In the decorations through
out the mansion. . â¢
Admiral Remey received the callers by
the side of General MacArthur and the
wives of several generals assisted.
The introductions were made by General
MacArthur's staff, assisted by members
of the staff of Admiral Remey. The call
ers after having been introduced, passed
out upon a broad balcony overhanging
the Pasig River, and a majority of them
lingered about the mansion until the cere
monies were finished.
Archbishop Chappelle, the apostolic del
egate to the Philippines, and other church
dignitaries were received first. The mem
bers of the Philippine Commission and
the Judges appeared In black frock coats,
and their attire formed a decided contrast
to the white and gpld uniforms of the
officers of the army and navy. The FiU
plno women wore elaborate native cos
tumes and conversed affably In Spanish.
Mrs. Henry 1.. Tatum. Â£525 Padflo av
enue, committed sucide early yesterday
morning by turning on the gas in her
bathroom. The act was committed In a fit
of Insanity with which the lady had been
ufflicted during the last two years. She
was the wife of Henry L.. . Tatum, of the
firm of Tatum & Bowen, SI and 36 Fre
mont street. â¢ . â¢
'.Mrs. Tatum .was a devout member of
the Kpiscopalian Church, and being of a
highly sensitive temperament, her mind
ftrooded unduiy on religious topics until a
religious mania developed itself about
two years ego. This mania was inter
mittent, and when afflicted with such
â¢epells *he was closely guarded and kept
under the medical eye of Dr. Barger, her
family physician. On : New Year's evÂ«
she appeared to be in her usual good
health and spirits and extended to her
husband and her son, Frederick, the com
pliments of the season. . .
About 4:30 o'clock, yesterday morning
her husband awoke with an uneasy feel
ing and went to her room to see If she
were asleep, she- having been frequently
subject to spells of .insomnia of late. He
taw that she was hot there and in pass-
Ing through another room he detected the
odor of illuminating- gaa proceeding from
the bathroom, where he found her dead
body lying. on the floor. The key of the
gas fixture was open.
The unfortunate woman was a native
of New Jersey, 44 years old.
Mrs. Henry L. Tatum While
Â¦ Demented Commits
Suicide.
TURNS ON GAS
AND MEETS DEATH
The deceased leaves a' wife and a niece,
Mrs. North, besides other relatives. He
was a native of Olend, Sweden.
Captain Andrew Nelson, president of
the California Transportation Company
and a pioneer of the State, died at hie
residence, 720 O'Farrell street, yesterday
afternoon after a brief illness. Captain
Nelson, who was 74 years of age, had for
some time suffered from Internal troubles,
but none- of his friends or relatives
guessed death was so near and the news
of his untimely taking off will cause a
shock of pain to many who had known
and loved him.
When Captain Nelson came to California
in 1819, he intended only to make a honey
moon trip, for he had married in an
Kastern State. He realized, however,
what splendid possibilities lay In freight
transportation on the Sacramento River
and devoted all his energies to bringing
about -the establishment of a steamer
line. When the steamer Reform was
launched her paddles were the first to
beat the waters of the Sacramento and
to Captain Nelson must ever belong the
honor of being, the pioneer navigator of
that waterway. The success of the Re
form caused Captain Xelson to form a
company and build more boats for freight
service and shortly a fleet was plying
under his management. Active in busi
ness his was a familiar figure about town
and he -will be missed from his accus
tomed haunts. To the end Captain Nel
son insisted on seeking his office every
morning, for he took great pleasure in
seeing the business he had Inaugurated
grow day by day.
Captain Andrew Nelson, Who
Built the First River
Steamer, Is Dead.
PIONEER PASSES
SUDDENLY AWAY
The Committee on Interstate and For
olpn Commerce will try to have three
days set aside for the consideration of
bills reported from that committee, when
the bill for the reorganization of the rev
enue cutter service and the Pacific cable
bill, with pome measures of minor import
ance, will be taken up.'
The river and harbor appropriation bill
will lie reported before the end of the
week, and thif and other regular annual
appropriation bills will be put through
without much delay.
In the House one of the first measures
of importance to be taken up will be the
reapportionment bill, on which a lively
fipht is expected between those favoring
the Hopkins bill, which maintains the
membership of the House at the present
numbers, but Increases the representation
of some States while reducing others, and
those favoring . the Burleigh bill, which
proposes to Increase the membership
enough to prevent a reduction in the rep
resentation of any State.
The Xicaraguan canal bill will not be
pushed in the Senate Immediately after
reassembling, and It may go over until
next session without action. Senator Per
kins of California, one of the strong ad
vocates of the bill, said to-day that It
would be held back until the end of Janu
ary out of courtesy to Great Britain, in
order to Rive a reasonable time for the ac
ceptance by that Government of the
amendments to the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty, but that he believed the bill would
be taken up and passed early in February
regardless whether Great' Britain accept
ed the amended treaty or not.
The Senate Finance Committee will take
up the war tax reduction bill this week
and will probably report it without much
delay. The brewers aie still continuing
their fight for further i eduction of the tax
on beer and the bankers are making a
systematic campaign for the repeal of the
tax on bank capitalization. No decision
has yet been reached l.y the -Republican
members of the Finance Committee on
either of these subject?.
Another obstacle In the way of the
subsidy bill Is the army reorganization
bill. There is no disposition on the part
of Senator Hawley and the other Repub
lican members of the Military Committee
to antagonize the shipping bill, and they
will endeavor to have the army bill dis
posed of during- the morning hour. As
Senator Jones of Arkansas and" others
have declared their intention to oppose
permanent increase in the regular army,
however, it may be impossible to get this
bill through without displacing the ship
ping bill and the necessity of army legis
lation is so urgent that this may have to
be done.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Jan. 1.â Congress
will reconvene on Thursday with but Â»*.f
ty^ore legislative days of session remain

RIGHTS OF COSTA
RICA IN CANAL
Minister Calvo* Pleased With
: the Results of the Ne
' / .gotiations.
â¢ Â¦ . Â»
" WASfllNQTON, . Jan. 1.â The Costa
RIcan Minister. Seqor Calvo, eald. to-day
in a general talk on Xicaraguan canal af
fairs'that one of the most s-utisfactory
features of the extended" negotiations, so
far as Costa Rica, was concerned, wa? the
universal acceptance ; of that country's
substantial .rights and; interests in the
isthmian waterway. There never has been
"any doubt of these rights on the part of
Cos-ta Kica, but for .many years they were
brought into controversy, it being claimed
that Costa. Rica hadfno sovereignty over
any portion <if the. route and thai at most
her interest' could bo satisfied by com
pensation". Thi.Â« brough.t about the .use
*>t the name "Nicaragua Canal,", which
seems to leave out of account the rights
.which Costa Kiea has in the â¢ waterway.
.The Minister 'points out that the period
of controversy now has been satisfactor
ily closed and that there apjjears to be
no disposition 1 in any quarter to question
Costa Rica's rights in the canal route.
. In this connection. Air. Calvo recalled
the long efforts toward building the canal,
dating back to 1858, in all Of which Costa
Rica had been strongly favorable to the
project" and Invariably had been recog
nized as a necessary party to the under
taking. After the treaty of limits was
Â»lgned, fixing the boundary between Nica
ragua and Costa Rica, a gif ted French
man named Felix BaiUy made his appear
ance In" Central America and negotiated
for a canal concession.- .
It was- not 'known at the tlme# but it
has since become well established, that
â¢M. BaiUy was executing a part of the
plans of Xapoleon III to gain a foothold
in Mexico and Central America and to
control the great commercial waterway
across the Isthmus. A concession
was granted,- three parties signing it
jointly, M. Â¦ Bailly . and the govern
ments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
This clearly Indicated the recognized In
terests of Costa Rica in the canal. No
work was done on the concession, how
ever, and it lapsed. Later another
Frenchman, M. Chevalier, negotiated a
second French concession, also believed
to be in the interests of the French plans
concerning Mexico and .Central America.
This concession also lapsed for want of
work being done.
When the concession was granted to
the Maritime Canal Company, Nicaragua
was the first to grant the concession.
Later the interests of Costa Rica in
the waterway were recognized by the
canal authorities and a second concession
tubs granted by Costa Rica.
There have been several arbitrations on
the boundary. question â first, by President
Cleveland tin to the treaty of limits, and,
more recently, by an American engineer,
designed by this Government to actually
Iny out the boundary lines. The line fin
aliy was agreed to and run last July, and
aiÂ« now marked on the official surveys it
leaves no further room for doubt of Costa
Rica'p territorial and sovereign rights in
connection with the waterway. Since then
nil of the negotiations have recognized
the Interest?, of both governments along
the canal route.

CONSTITUTION'S
LIMITATIONS
This rule applies when both were negli
gent at the same time. This Â¦ rule, the
reader must keep In mind, applies only
when both are negligent and contribute to
the result. There are many cases of thU
kind and it is extremely difficultâ nay, Im
possibleâto find out which is most at
fault. In a collision, for example, be
tween two vessels or stages or trains the
conductors on both sides, are negligent,
but which is the most so cannot be ascer
tained. In all these cases the above rule
cuts the knot and denies a remedy to
either party.
This rule, however, cannot be applied in
all cases of negligence on both sides. It
must be concurring negligence, happening
at the same time, or nearly so. In many
cases, to call for the application of the
rule. Then suppose an employer uses an
unsafe boiler and also employs an Incom
petent engineer. Is. the employer, respon
sible for an injury happening to the en
gineer or other servant In consequence of
using the boiler, though the engineer him
self may have been negligent in the per
formance of his duty? The court had no
difficulty when this case was tried in de
ciding that the employer was primarily
negligent In having such a boiler and was
therefore responsible for the conse
quences. This rule, which seems clear
enough when thus stated, has passed
through many changes during the last
forty years. A recent Federal court has
thus stated It: "Although the defendant's
negligence may have been the primary
cause of the Injury complained of. yet an
action, for such injury cannot be main
tained If the proximate and Immediate
cause of the injury can be traced, to the
want of ordinary care and camion in the
person Injured." This rule, however, yr&s
qualified in. one respectâ namely, that the
negligence of the person injured would
not.defeat his right to recover If he "could
show that the other party by the exercise
of reasonable care and prudence might
have avoided the consequences of the in
jured party's negligence.
The Rule of North Carolina. -
This rule may be made clearer by con
sidering the qualification which, in some
States, is a rule by itself. Thus In North
Carolina it Is declared that, notwith
standing the previous negligence of the
plaintiff, if at the time when anuniury
was committed: It might have been avoid
ed by the exercise of reasonable care and
prudence on the part of the defendant,
an action will He for damages.
In the Gunster case in that State the
plaintiff was employed as a foreman in
running a steam sawmill belonging tc the
defendant, and among other duties was
required to oil >Â¦ the. machinery. Once
while doing this the defendant, without
giving him any notice, turned pn the
'steam and set the mill In motion, where
by he was injured. The court remarked
that whatever want of care for his own
safety Qunster-may have shown In oc
cupying a place of -peril while dolntr, hi*
work. . no harm Â¦would hnv,e come to him
except for the hasty and thoughtless act
of. the defendant in startins the mill
vithout signal, warning or looking him
s>plf to spe. as he could have done, wheth
er ' the oiling was â¢' finished, and Â¦ Gunster
The Supreme Court of Maryland ha*
also stated that when the evidence Is con
flicting on the question whether the In
jured person contributed by his negligence
to his own injury, the Jury may, in con
nection with all the facts of the case, in
fer the absence of fault from the known
disposition of men to avoid injury to
themselves.
In another case A was one of a party of
men employed by a railroad company in
repairing its track. They were usually
carried in a boxcar to and from their place
of work. Although en several occasions
he had been forbidden from riding on the
pilot or bumper of the locomotive, he per
sisted in doing so. One evening, when he
was returning from his work and riding In
this manner the train in passing through
a tunnel collided with cars standing on
the track and he was Injured, while those
In the boxcar were unhurt. It was held
that as there was room for him In the car
there wa? no excuse for Incurring the
greater. risk; that his own negligence was
the chief cause of the accident, and he
could not therefore recover. The case
came before the United States Supreme
Court for review; and the court remarked
that "one who by his negligence has
brought an injury on himself cannot ref
cover damages for It. A plaintiff In such
cases Is entitled to no relief." But when
the defendant has been guilty of negli
gence also, then the question is "whether
the damage was occasioned entirely by
his negligence or improper conduct, or
whether the plaintiff himself so far con
tributed' to the misfortune by his own
negligence or want of ordinary care and
caution that but; for his negligence or
want of care and caution on his part the
misfortune would not have happened. In
the former case the plaintiff is entitled to
recover; in the latter he is not." In the
case before the court the Injured man was
declared to be negligent and consequently
could not recover.
When the Absence of Negligence
May Be Inferred. â¢
In one of the cases that happened in
Pennsylvania a track-repairer was killed
at night by the collision of a backing
train of cars with a handcar. In which he.
with others, was coming to the station.
The company's defense was that the vic
tim was negligent In approaching the sta
tion while the train was there. The jury
rendered a verdict* In favor of his wife,
but this did not stand. The Supreme
Court held that the jury was not properly
Instructed, and granted another trial.
Cases of Track Repairers.
Whether the second party has been neg
ligent in a particular case Is a question of
law and fact. It is a double question.
The fact is whether a particular act has
Keen done or omitted; this is purely a
question of fact. The second question Is,
whether the doing or omission of this act
was a legal duty; this Is a pure question
of law. Some applications of this rule
will now be given: There was a collision
between a stage and horse car once on a
time In New York City. Both were go
ing in the same direction. The stage,
whose owner sued, was violently pushed
against another. The one who sued won
his case before the jury, and the horse
car company appealed. It claimed that
the stage driver was negligent. The Judge
charged the jury that in order to recover
the stage driver must have been free from
any fault that contributed to the collision,
and the car conductor or driver or both
must have been negligent. The Court of
Appeals in reviewing the verdict also said:
"It is now well settled that if the plain
tiff's negligence contributed to the injury
he cannot recover, although the defend
ant was also negligent."
tion of Fact
A Virginia Case.
In Dun's case In Virginia the court re
marked that the principle that a person
who by his own default has brought on
rimself a loss or an Injury cannot claim
compensation of another. Is a principle
of universal application. This statement,
though, may be qualified. If the second
party, on the discovery of the danger into
which the other has brought himself, can
avoid or escape the consequences by the
exercise of proper care on his part, then
he may be held liable for not using his
wits and preventing the Injury.
Who Has Been Negligent Is a Ques-
When both employer and employe are
negligent, what does the law say to
them? This Is a very difficult question to
answer, and the courts have greatly dif
fered in their utterance*. One of the roost
general rules is that when it appears that
the negligence of the parties co-operati-s
to produce the Injury no action will He;
the law refuses to apportion the fault and
regards the negligence of either party
as equally contributory or effective in
causing the injury. The rule has been
stated by Mr. Justice Swayne, speaking
for the United States Supreme Court, in
the^e- words: "It has been a rule of law
from time immemorial, and is not likely to
te changed in all time to come, that there
can be no recovery for an injury caused
by the mutual fault of both parties.
Where It can be shown that It would not
have happened except for the culpable
negligence of the party injured concur
ring with that of the other party no action
can be maintained." . - ; .

Law Lessons for Employers and Em
ployesâThe Rule When Both
Parties Are Negligent
had left his position. Such care and at
tention on his part would have prevented
the accident. The place of peril which
Gunster had taken In oiling the machin
ery did not excuse the defendant, but Im
posed on him greater diligence and a
higher duty to see that the way was clear
for starting the machinery. "The plain
tiffs exposure- of his person waa not a
i-ause. but a condition which rendered the
injury possible and actual, as the result
ei the- absence of the caution which was
Imposed on the defendant in conse
quence."'
In attempting to unite the two rules, as
the United States Supreme Court dm
done, another rule has been made that
cannot always be easily applied. The
North Carolina rule 19 quite simple.
Though the person injured was negligent,
yet he can recover If his injury would not
fca\-e happened had the other party exer
cised reasonable care and prudence. By
the Federal rule, if the cause of an em
r>oye's injury was the lack of his Imme
diate care, he can recover nothing, even
though his employer was the primary
cause of the Injury. In tome cases he
can nevertheless ret. over. In what cases?
In those where the employer was negli
gent, but where no injury would have
happened had the employer exercised rea
sonable care and prudence..
The Rule in Vermont and Indiana.
In Vermont a still simpler rule has been
set up. An employe in order to recover
for an injury must show that it did not
occur from any want of ordinary care on
his part, either In whole or In part In
other words, if ordinary care on his part
Â¦would have enabled him to escape the
consequences of his employer's negligence
he has no ground of complaint- "He may
be said, in such a case, to have been him
self the cause of any injury whlcn fia
may have sustained under such circum
stances." The rule In Indiana is nearly
the same. Said the court on one occasion
calling for an application of the rule: "It
Is the settled law of this State that where
negligence is the issue it must be a case
of unmixed negligence: that in such case
a party cannot recover if it appear that
by the want of ordinary care and pru
dence on his part he contributed to the
injury, or if by the exercise of ordinary
care he might have prevented the in
jury."
The Rule of Kentucky.
This is the rule In other States. In Ken
tucky, for example, the rule has bÂ«wÂ»n
thus stated: If the evidence In a case
shows that the Injury to an employe re
sulted from either of two causes, only one
of which was due to an employer's negli
gence, no Inference can be decisive, and
his injured employe cannot recover, be
cause he must make out a positive case.
Thus after a freight train had passed
through a tunnel a brakeman wasi found
In a dying condition. There were loose
timbers hanging from the roof, and one
theory was that he did not sit down
whenhe came to the tunnel, as he should
have done. As there was no positive
proof of the cause of his death the negli
gence of the company was not proved.
Can Negligence Bs Presumed?
When a person Is injured and sue* his
employer to recover, he must make out
hi? case that his employer was negligent
Can this ever be presumed? In Smith
Carolina the Supreme Court held It could
be In some cases. In one of these, catt'. >
were injured through the negligence of
the engineer of a railroad In running over
them. He had done so several times by
fore, and the court thought thÂ« presump
tion had been made out. An attempt wa<*
afterward made to change the rule thus
laid down by the court, but it did not suc
ceed. The court declared that the owner
of the cattle having proved that they
were killed by the train, the railroad com
pany, in order to make a good defense,
must shew that its engineer had not beea
negligent.
When Employes Using: Defective Ma-
cbinery Can Recover.
The question has often been raised and
decided whether an employÂ© can recover
for Injuries caused by using machinery or
appliances which he knows are defective.
Such cases have almost always been de
cided In favor of the- employer, as we
have seen, on the ground that his employe
assumed the risk. Of course ar. employer
would be liable if the defects were known
by him alone and his employe had no
reason of knowing them. But the Su
preme Court of Mfssourl has released, the
liability of employers on a different
ground. Employes are declared to bo
guilty, of contributory negliser.ee In usinsr
such machines or appliances. It Is true
their employer Is negligent in fumlahlnff
them with a defective machineâ a carding
machine, for example. On the other hand,
they are also held to be negligent In us
ing the machine if it was plainly defective
and dangerous. Consequently. If they ar->
Injured and sue their employer he in ef
fect says: "I was negligent in having the
machine, but you knew it was out of re
pair and dangerous to run, and ought not
to have touched it. It is true I tempted
you with employment at a time when
you were in sore need- of It, but you should
not have yielded to the temptation. " A3
you did. you alone must suffer the conse
quences, for you cannot deny that you
were negligent In operating the machine.
Indeed, the very charge you bring agninst
me is a net that Incloses- yourself." Such
is the law; whether it ought to bÂ« so ! J
not. we once more repeat, for us to con
sider.

the following- is taken:
Â¦: "The year opened with a fair quantity of rain
In the central â¢ and northern portions of the
State, but a scant rainfall In Southern Califor
nia. One of the most noticeable features of the
first six 'Weeks was tha prevalence of tula fog
In nearly all the valleys north of the Tehach
apl. There was also more cloudiness and fog
than usual In the south. This continued foggy
weather kept the soil in such a moist condition
that- all farming ' operations were seriously re
tarded. As an offset to this delay, however,
there were no drying winds, and consequently
the lack, of tjalnf all was lest injurious than It
would otherwise have been. The deficiency la
rainfall for tha. whole Btate for tha month of
January exceeded ona inch. . - -Â¦
. "By tho middle of 'February conditions had
been . generally favorable for all deciduous
fruits, but the absence of sufficient rainfall, es
pecially ' in Southern California, caused con
siderable - apprehension among farmers. la
many places the grain continued in good con
dition, but in Southern California the continued
dry weather, .; accompanied by high winds,
caused the grain. to turn yellow, and. the pros
pect of a good crop was discouraging. The cor
respondent at -San IMego stated that the sea
sonal rainfall In that section had been less than
In any season since 1976. The Â¦ rainfall de
ficiency for the State exceeded two inches dur
ing February. gjTrWff rltajfefflBMiattiasJ
"March brought nearly normal temperatures,
with heavy rainfall on the 3d and 4th, distri
buted prcner.ally throughout : the 8tato. "In
Southern California only , were prospects dis
couraging. In the southern Interior counties In
many Â¦ cases grain and hay were beyond re
demption. . " i
"During April, the central and northern por
tions of the State received sufficient 'rain, but
it wrb not until near the end' of the month
that the rainfall In the : southern portion was
sufficiently heavy tp be of much benefit to agri
culturists, t There were some heavy frosts dur
ing April, with slight injury to grape vines and
tree.frult3, but on the whole ; deciduous fruits
came .through without much 'damage... In April
the rainfall exceeded. tha normal - amount by.
nearly two Inches. , .V Â¦ ... .
; "There were no serious northers -In the great
valleys of California during the month of June."
Near the end of the month, in portions of the
Bacramento* Valley and in some of the northern
coast counties, showers slightly injured hay and
npe fruit." TA Revere norther in portions of the
Sacramento ~. Valley at the beginning 'Â¦ of July,
caused some damage i to wheat ; and : ripe fruit, ;
but with this; exception conditions were most
favorable for all crops. Trees â¢ In . the â¢ central
end northern portions of the State were heavily,
laden . with peaches, - pears , and - prunes, v The
yield of . apricots was r larger than > expected,"
while grapes, oranges, olives and walnuts were
abundant.'. Potato blight seriously affected' the
crop in Humboldt Cffunty. The yield of "wheat
was disappointing: in- all sections, : and the
shortage wrs accounted for In various ways in
different â¢ places.' ' In the , Sacramento I and San

I Â¦ The year 1901 shows a most prosperous open
ing for -each and every branch of commerce
where fuel has heretofore been a leading item
of expense. .Oil has come .to the rescue. and
Us '- beneficent 'Influence cannot be overesti
mated, ~. as there, is an unlimited field, for the
manufacturing', of varied articles, many of
which we are forced to import at present. The
coal demand for our vat led steamships, trans
ports, etc., a!.Â«o for . domestic purposes, will
never be less than It ' la" now.' All signs point
to the. coming. year being the banner year for
California, 'Â¦ a Â¦ seasonable rainfall to date, our
canneries -.<fru.lt -"and fish) running to, their
fullest capacity, our gold mines yielding.bount
ifully, new--; lines of steamers ; projected, and
now 'fuel oil to furnish cheap energy, the above
combined mean assured prosperity.
PIG IRONâ The arrivals of pig Iron by sail
aggregate S306 tons, of this SS20.tom are Eng
lish, the balance is American.. The total de
liveries last year were 6393 tons. Prices have
fluctuated- materially, yet the amount melted
shows that a fair business has been done in
th# line, with bright prospects for a still
further Improvement this coming year..
COKE-^The total amount received % here by
water foots up 41,741 tons, against 31.091 tons
last year. It is difficult to -'approximate tha
quantity received by rail, as it does not reach
,San Francisco, being delivered direct to in
terior consumers.' Over 50 per cent of the
coke reaching here cones direct by sail from
England. There were over Â«,000 tons of Conux
coke delivered - here from British Columbia,
which, found immediate sale.
FT.' EL OILâ No event has occurred In the
history of our State. ' which will determine its
permanent and successful career, as- tho prom
ising oil developments In several of our in
terior counties during the year 1300. It now
declares. itself a potent factor as a steam and
heat producer to every manufacturing Interest
in the State, and Its permanency cannot now
be questioned. It will . take several months
before Its distribution can be uniform and con
sumers may become assured of regular delivery
as required.' Already several of our. large coal
consumers have modified their plant -to con
form to oit. they claim the change has dimin
ished their expense' Recount materially and
they can tee no valid reason for discontinuing
Its use. I have gleaned Information . through
every reliable source and I feel assured that
my figures are conservatively correct, that the
product of fuel oil (only) for 1900 will foot up
4,300,000 barrels, and for the Incoming, year It
can be safely estimated that these figures will
be increased fully 12H per cent. This will be
an Increase of about 100 per cent over and
above the , flarurvs officially reported by tha
State Mining Bureau as the output for 1839. It
is claimed Ihere are over 1450 wells now pro
ducing, which number Is Increasing monthly.
Some of these wells have been capped, as the
'present tankage is insufficient, although their
present capacity Including the refineries' tanks
amounts to nearly 9C0.GC0 barrels. Fuel oil can
be delivered to consumers here at about Jl per
barrel, and It Is generally conceded that this
price will be shaded -later on. This means low
priced fuel and will assure us a large number
of factories, etc., which could not be profitably
maintained under ruling coal values.
coal consumption of California I have been
obllped to include deliveries at Port Los
Angeles and San Diego by water, which has
hÂ»tn added In ; the' fibove sources of supply.
The total amount received by water at those
two ports foot up 165,9i3 tons.. '- . .

To secure 'a complete statement of the entire
Tho umual report of J. \V. Harrison for 1900
says of cool, and oil: ' .. .:'-:.* '
This has , proved Itself the banner ; year for
coal Import* into California, exceeding. in quan
tityall . former , years. Fuel consumption Is
usually'^ figured as an Infallible Indicator of
prosperity," henco we must' credit' 1900 as being
In the foremost position for profits emanating
from railroads,* shipbuilding, iron products and
manufacturing Â¦ Interests, generally.: The,in
creased ; consumption in the face of the ' ex
tremely high cost of coal pervading' the -year
evidences great prosperity â¢ In all commercial
branches,' particularly -so < for our ' coast â¢col
liery proprietors. They . have found a markpt
here and in j Honolulu for â¢ the'ir entire : output,
and the prices realized are largely In excess
of those ruling for the past several years.
There is every probability that the coal Im
ports will be .equal .in -volume this incoming
year, but values will nut rule as high, as'con
ditions will be dissimilar. Coal carriage will
be. less , and- fuel oil will declare Itself as a
formidable ' competitor, ( In fact coal contracts
are now. being made at shaded figures for next
year's delivery. : : The Australian shipments are
diminishing gradually, as our local consumers
cannot 'pay Importers' asking prices, which are
fully ' 15 : per cent higher .than this time last
year. : 'Deliveries from Great' Britain are al
most nil, as quotations there make their con
sumption prohibitory, the asking prices f . o. b.
at the various. shipping points. in England and
Wales In -some cases -are . more than double
those of a Â¦â¢ year ago. .-' W'% are promised new

DEATH IN NEWARK OF
EEV. HANNIBAL GOODWIN
Deceased was 32 years of age, a native
of San Jose, and unmarried. He is sur
vived by a brother, F. D. Monckton, and
a sister, Mrs. L. S. B. Sawyer.
Monckton was an important witness in
the contempt proceedings before Commis
sioner Heacock against Dudley Dubose,
who is McKenzle's attorney. The Investi
gation was postponed on account of
Monckton's illness.
Occupants of the lower flat pay they
heard the deceased coughing during the
a f ternoon.
Shelden T. Monckton. a Deputy United
States Marshal,- was found dying in a
chair at his home at 914V4 Devlsadero
street about 5 p. m. yesterday. He was
sitting in a chair next to a gas stove,
which was not lighted, but from which
gas was escaping. Drs. R. W. Baun and
C. Burnham were summoned, but despite
all efforts consciousness could not be re
stored and Monckton died about 7 p. m.
The theory of suicide was advanced, but
this was denied by the relatives. Monck
ton had been a sufferer from inflamma
tory rheumatism contracted in Nome,
to which place he was sent to bring back
Receiver McKenzle. Early yesterday
afternoon he started for the dining-room,
eaylng he had had little sleep the night
before and wanted a rest. That was the
last seen of him until he was discovered
by a young lady who came to the house.
On opening the front door she noticed the
smell of escaping gas. Opening the door
of the dining-room she discovered Monck
ton in the position described.

when seen at her home; 3433 Sixteenth
street. San Francisco, last night,
declared when told of the distin
guishing features and clothes of the
body found, that It was that of her
husband. Other members of the house
hold also recalled his appearance and
dress, and when the general aspect of the
body was described to them coincided
with Mrs. Stendel in her apprehensions.
' "I now fear the worst," said Mrs. Sten
del. "Mv husband wore five false front
teeth and one porcelaine back one. His
customary underwear was blue flannel,
and his shirt was of the same material.
When last I saw him he wore a pair of
well worn corduroy trousers. His hair
was a striking feature, being remarkably
luxuriant. He. also wore a heavy mus
tache." â¢ _Â¦ '
As a matter of fact, the recovery of
Captain Stendel's. body only settles one
Questionâ namely.- that the owner of the
sloop Lulu Is dead. It Is still left to say
what were the facts surrounding his
strange exit from. the world.

a Cabinet officer or two will probably Join

Surveyor Spear says that the President
expects to visit places other than San
Francisco, and to remain in the State
some time. The President visited this
coast to attend the National Encampment
of the Grand Army of the Republic in
1886, but at that time did not have an op
portunity to see as . much of California
as he desired, hence he is -making plans
for an extended visit this trip.
No doubt the President will be accom

President promised Irving M. , Scott that
he would be here to see the ship launched.

FOR A GOOD TIME
THE Latin quarter of San Francis
co was agog with excitement yes
terday, for. in addition to the cel
ebration of the beginning of the
â¢ century," the residents took part
in the wedding festivities of two of their
noted neighbors'.
Leon de Bernardi, known throughout
the city as the ''King of the Newsboys."
was united in marriage to Miss Adele
Thiel. the ceremony being performed in
St. Francis Church, Vatlejo street and
Montgomery avenue, at 10 o'clock in the
morning.
Rev. Father O'Nell officiated at the wed
ding, which was witnessed by a large
number, of relatives and friends of the
contracting parties. The bride was charm
ingly gowned in white satin and was giv
en away by her mother, Mrs. Louise
Among those who were present at the
â¢wedding and the subsequent festivities
were Mrs. L. Thlel. Miss M. R. Thiel, Mr.
and Mrs. de Bernardi,. Mr. and Mrs. P. J.
HalUpan, Mr. and Mrs. M. Froment, Mr.
and Mrs. Paul de Bernardi, Mr. and. Mrs.
After the ceremony the bridal couple
was given a reception at the home of the
bride's mother, 531 Greenwich street, the
house being decorated with evergreens
and flowers. The wedding breakfast was
an elaborate one and many toasts were
given in honor of the "century bridal
couple." The afternoon and evening were
spent in musical entertainment and danc
ing, and at a late hour the wedded couple
departed to their new home, 424 Filbert
street.
Thiel. Miss Marie Rose Thiel, sister of
the bride, was the maid oX honor, and
the groom was attended by Edmund Llnd
wall.
The- "King of- the Newsboys" has
amassed a comfortable competency by
diligent and hard work. Although a
young man, he has in the last eleven years
saved enough money to build two houses
on Filbert street. Starting in life in a
small way, he worked to the' top of the
ladder, until he now has nearly all the
newsboys in the city In his employ.
His business associates were given a
â¢banquet on Monday night and the "King"
presided at the feast. Mr. and Mrs. de
Bernardi were the recipients of many val
uable wedding presents and the pair start
their honeymoon with the well wishes of
all who know them.

Bath Beach. West Berkeley. Martin
Wulbern and Posen Johnson, boys who
trer* strolling on the t>each. saw the re
mains floating in with the tide, and they
hauled the .body ashore, notifying the
Deputy Coroner, â¢who removed the corpse
to the morgue. The recovery of the body
settles all question concerning the erica
for help that aroused the Point Richmond
watchman. That -Captain . ..ondel was the
victim of foul, play appears to be born-?
out by general appearances. In spite of
â¢the almost unrecogn'.zablc ! condition of
Â¦ the body, because of much decomposition,
.there are two ugly telltale marks of vio-
Jcnce upon the temple?. The evidence :of
force also is presented In the condition of
Â¦the neck. There are bruises and other
marks manifest that could have been
tnade by choking. Deputy Coroner
Btreightifl* Is of the opinion that, the
bruise marks on the head were caused by
blows. The shouldors and collarbone
Â¦were also bruis^ed black and -blue, and
thes* were all further evidences to satisfy
the Deputy Coroner that something be
eides drowning had contributed to the
death of Stendel.
.Whether Etendel was drowned or killed
;. before he was thrown overboard Is a
question that must be determined by the
Â«.utops=y: The organs â¢will show whether,
Â¦life, was : extinct, before the 'mysterious
pallor went into the waters of the bay.
With the conditions of the case a? now
â¢presented Stentiel, if he were murdered.
wai= the victim of a quarrelsome or of an
avenging hand. Upon his person was
found a purse containing a considerable
amount of money, and ther* were other
â¢valuable* thart a man bent up.on .robbery
â¢would not have overlooked. It is the ge-n
Â«ral theory of the Investigating authori
ties that if the secrets surrounding- the
C"eath of Stendel shall ever be uncovered.
It will be found he was murdered as the
result o? a dispute with some .'partner in
hjs Ftranpe occupation. . '
The body was fully clad wtien it was re
covered. The clothing was of warm, sub
stantial goods, the outer garments being
Â¦working clothes of blue drilling. In the
pockets were a bunch of keys. a knife., a
cartridge extractor and the purse of coin.
Deputy Coroner StreightiiT took, charge -of
the property, and so carefully did he put
It out of sight that he made no public rec
ord of the amount of money found upon
the body. When demand â¢was made upon
the deputy to make known the sum he re
fused, saying: "I do not care to tell how
much money was on the body, because
the scia Â¦was considerably more than is
usually recovered from bodies taken from
the bay. If the amount were known there
might be en attempt made by some one
not entitled to the coin to try to secure
it." . â¢ -
The Coroner's officials at "Berkeley: made
tio attemept to secure, an identification of
the body. That was accomplished by a
Call reporter who gave a minute de
scription of the remains to Mrs. Stendel.
â¢who at once positively recognized Â¦ the
body as that "of her missing spouse.
"I am satisfied, after carefully viewing
the body," said Deputy Coroner Streight
lff. 'that these marks are from blows be
fore death and not from violent contact
of the boflv with' the rocks, as it floated
on with the tides.
"The two bad discoloration?.. about the
temples are clearly not the result of such
violence, but are. I feel almost certain,
the evidence of heaw blows that would fn
themselves bring death. Of course, if
the theory of blows shall be accepted,
then it becomes a certainty that the man
was murdered or at least unconscious
Trh*Â»n he fell or was pitched into the bay.
That means also that the mysterious
cries he.vd at Point Richmond came not
from a drowning man, but from a man
struggling on the deck of his mysterious
oraft in the night's darkness, against an

"However, I Intend to: see that the Chin
ese are given ample police protection and
will have the streets of Chinatown con
stantly patrolled, so that there will be no
objection to the withdrawal of the squad."
It is understood that Ithe uniformed of
ficers, who have been selected to patrol
the streets of Chinatown, will be given
absolute authority to raid a gambling
game when it is deemed advisable. Boys
will be strictly prohibited from entering
the games, and If one is admitted a block
ade will he established on the place an.1
the proprietor forced to go out of busi
ness.
At the end of every month the proprie
tor of the games will be cited to appear
in the police court and the usual fines Ira
posed.
The order withdrawing the Chinatown
squad was not unexpected. Since the
meeting of the Police Commissioners last
Thursday, when the proposition to license
the games in Chinatown was defeated, it
was quietly hinted that the Chief intended
to carry, out the scheme despite the ac
tion of the board. ' After carefully con
sidering the matter he decided yesterday
to withdraw the Chinatown squad, and so
informed his captains.
"Chinatown will be as rigidly patrolled
as ever," remarked the Chief shortly
after he had- issued the order withdraw
ing the squad. "I have carefully consid
ered the vexed problem of suppressing
gambling in Chinatown, and find that the
only solution is to force ' the proprietors
and dealers to contribute to the city
treasury. I might detail all my men to
suppress gaming in the Chinese quarter,
but even then I doubt whether I would
be successful.
He will assist "Colonel" Shaw, the com
missary of the prison, in providing rations
for the prisoners.
A short time afterward Brophy and his
men went to police headquarters, where
they were ordered by the chief to report
to Â¦ their respective captains. "Billy"
Young, the Beau Brummel of the Police
Department; and who is regarded as be
ing one of the best men in the squad, wan
doubly surprised upon being told that he
had been assigned to duty in the City
Prison.
"This is Indeed a New Year's gift," joy
fully remarked the "little sergeant," as
he ' is more familiarly known.' "Le.t us
drink to the health of. the chief."
For the first time In many years gam
bling in Chinatown was conducted yester
day without police interference. Evident
ly determined to execute his 'plan to force
the Chinese gamblers to periodically con
tribute to. the city treasury. Chief of Po
lice Sullivan yesterday morning issued an
order withdrawing the Chinatown -squad.
Word was at once sent to Sergeant'Bro
.phy, who was In charge of the squad,
and calling his men together he told them
of the order. of the, head of the depart
ment.
