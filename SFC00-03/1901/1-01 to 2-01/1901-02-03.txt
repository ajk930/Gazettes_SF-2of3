This young woman, whose portrait ; will
coon bo hues beside those of the famous
Russian Spies in America.
The Russian secret police are probably
the most skillful ln the world; they need
to be.
In the days of Napoleon III the police
of France had that reputation. They
haven't It nowâ for the best of reasons.
Ah Emperor needs skillful spies In all the
worldâ a republic doesn't. . â¢
Russia has had Its lessons In the death,
of the late Czar and in the many attempts
made \ipon the present ruler. So the chief
of political police keeps agents in every
great city In the world. . New York, whera
bo many Russian nihilists have found
refuge: San â¢ Francisco and Chicago aro
especially, favored In this way. Escaped
convicts from Siberia sometimes drift to
the Pacific "Coast, while Chicago is
watched on general principles. New York,
however. Is getting to be more and more,
the. chief object of the solicitous atten
tions of pie Czar's people.
The spies who keep tab on nihilists In
America always claim to be nihilists
themselves, exiled for their political view9
or escaped suspects. It is their plan to
secure admittance to some of the many
nihilist circles here and keep the police In
formed of what goes on.
So long as the nihilists confine them
selves Â¦ to, epeecnmaklnc - nothing Is donÂ»
about It. But if one of them should start
for St. Petersburg with such a mission as
that which took Bresal from Paterson the
home authorities would be, warned and
Â¦tand ready .to receive him after certain
well-known precedents.

gards them with an amused smile. He
gathers up a handful and Impressively

tell them anything, but don't let them upj
"The Duke is so eof t-hearted ' to the
press," she explains.
"Well. I've been there myself." replies
the Duke. "I s'pose you know I wrote
for one of the New York papers last year.
I used to curse upstairs and down cellar
if I sent a man out on a story and he
came back without It. '.?'*',.'&
"I like to treat a reporter like a white

"Do you like newspaper work?" inter
rupts her Grace. "My aunt. Miss Evans,

There isn't a iinge of ostentation about
this ducal pair nor the taint of cheap
pride. The Duchess Is even careful to put
on the brakes when describing Tanderagee
Castle, her husband's ancestral home.
"Perhaps I oughtn't to go into ecstacies
over our own home," she says, ''but it's
really Just the most beautiful place I

' Tea was now brought in, and the Duch

. raoue at him, and some one starts the ball
rolling over the links. They are all In

moved up three places In the river. I
belong to the Leander Boat Club of Lon
don, to which only. those are eligible who
have rowed three winning races, either In
single sculls, doubles or In a crew."
"Stand up and show" your muscle," says
Lord Lambert, and with all the airs and
graces of the spieler for the strong man
his Lordship feels his Grace's muscle.
Â¦ "Two hundred and eight pounds and hard
as rocks." Is his final tribute to the
Duke's brawn.
Save for a rather pasty skin, the Duke
Is a fine specimen of young manhood; aa
little like the pictured puny Duke of the
pen - as can be I imagined. He has ' the
basso prof undo voice of the Englishman,
but none of the cockneyism of the cad.
He. has annexed no : small amount of
American slang to his English. Above all
the Duke has an easy, informal manner.,
and If there Is any ego in his makeup It
Is not aggressively apparent* !Â¦'â¢. '
A request that the Duchess allow herself
to be photographed brings a storm of pro
tests. "I. loathe it." eays the Duchess.
"I; sat in New York twice, and I made up
my mind, positively. never, to do It again."
No, no, no; they hadn't any photographs

kriits her brows in open disapproval.

"Do you know."* Â«ays 4 the Duke, "the

the faultily faultless beauty of the poet.
Her mouth and nose are Just Irregular
enough to be piquant. Her large gray
eyes are rarely beautiful, with' an expres
sion half laughing, half wistful, that is
very captivating.
Her hair is of that indefinable chads
which is neither brown nor gold nor red,
but a mixture of all threeâ a combination
which usually produces a "sandy" result,
but in this case has achieved the "French
blonde." . . , Â¦'
Her complexion is good, though over the'
pink and white of her cheeks there is a
sprinkling of "sun kisses" that proves her
love of outdoor life. Where the sleeve
falls away from the wrist there Is a hint
of- an arm white and beautifully rounded.}
She is neither "divinely tall" nor yet'
"divinely slender." Just a healthy, fresh-'
colored girl, who even when she has *
sere throat can be gay.
Lord Lambert attempted a funny story'
apropos of nothing. But it served the pur
pose of making the Duchess smile. "His
Grace tries to discount it with a funnier
one.
The Duchess forgets her sore throat.
"How you English can punish a good

Jully at the Palace Hotel's best. "Come.

Lord Lambert takes careful aim at the
Duke and fires a center 'shot. Five min
utes of this merry verbal battledore and
ehuttleoock. then a request to see the
Duchess of Manchester creates a pudden .
lull. The Duke considers. The Lord looks
a protest with his eyes.
"Say, honestly." says the Duke, "she
hates this sort of thir.p. ' Besides she's not
feeling well, poor little girl! You'il excuse
her, won't you?"
For answer there Is the frou-frou of
silken ruffles and a plaintive voice comes
floating in, "Gracie, where are you? The
horrid doctor says ray throat is very bad.
but I'm polr.g to dress for dinner any

the door. His Grace and his Lordship
inake a dive for it.

Is evidently annoyed; the Duke does the
act, and does it gracefully. It smooths
the little pucker in her Grace's brow .and
eciFsor? her "another reporter" in two.
The Duchess of .Manchester sinks into
an armchair. Her pink satin negligee
trails in shimmering folds, revealing a
petticoat of cream lace, under which feet
like little pink mice peep In and out. This
Ancle-American Duchess. despite her
Teutonic papa, has a Spanish Instep.
Her Grace has two feverish Fpots of
pink burring on either cheek. Her volcÂ«
is sweet and I0T7, but it Is evidently with
fllfflcajty that the notes issue from her
erarlet, poatjng? mouth, "My throat burts
eo." and she raises a slim, jeweled band
to her white throat. Â« â¢
Lord Lambert closes a window and ad-
Justs a IV.ir.d.
The Duke of Manchester stirs the fire.
His Lordship wheels up a chair and in
eifts on her Grace taking it.
The Duke brings a footstool and ar
ranges the Colds of her gown.

J. Wayne Amos, Who Is a Living

SOUTHnrtN" CALIFORNIA boasts a
lHirg image of Abraham Lincoln.
V.'hilo the "Savior of his country"
6le*?ps peacefully where the- cares
of Ftate do not worry antl the dastardly
aF5a?-5in raises not his cowardly hand, his
memory is krpt ever fresh in the public
mind in the southland because of; the
wonderful resemblance which ' another
bears. . . . ' .â¢- .
The name of the man who, had he been
then as he If now, couM' wifH ease 'have
posed successfully as the chief executive
of the nation is J. Wayne Amos,' alÂ»d he
lives Jn San Bernardino. By people who
vere familiar with the face and Jigure of
The martyred President Mr. Amos is said
to resemble him r-o closely that it Is hardly
possible to believe that no ties of con
tangruinity are responsible for it.
" As was the jurat Lincoln. Mr. Amos is
very tall, his shoulders slightly stooping,
his eyes keen and his features kindly but
firm. And he is ever so homely. That -was
the pride of Uncoln, and Mr. Amos feels
the. same way about it. : . .
It is not only Ju -outward i appearance
that Mr. Amos is .like the emancipator of
the .negro. There is much in his make
up that is the same. He Is- ah inveterate
story-teller, full of common-sense philos
ophy and dry humor, fond of a practical
joke and the embodiment of good nature
under almost any conditions. He Is not
awkward in his speech or manner, yet he
seems to convey the impression rihat he
Is double-jointed In spots, and his great
length of nether limb almost irresistibly

from injuries received through a bull us

consideration shown for the feelings of
the; bull is a fine touch, and suggests
grave questions on the moral responsibil

is stated to have "died from the effec.s
of injuries received after being run over

WHAT IS FAITN?mRS. FISKE'S art and personality
are topics of the hour. Discussion
Is rife everywhere as to her ge
n!us. and there are no two opin
ions alike on the subject. Probably very
. few people who will see Mrs. Fiske in
"Becky Sharp" and "Tess" recall her first
appearance in Sart Francisco. Old-timers
with long- memories will tell you, how
ever, of the debut here of Mrs. Fiske,
libout twenty years ago.
I Little Minnie Maddern. as she was then
known, was a beautiful and rarely gifted
little, girl, apparently between seven and
eight years of age.
Miss Maddern was a tremendous favor
. Ite with the public and with -the profes
sion as well', and was widely known in
those days as the wonder child. .
? It was during her first engagement here
- that little Minnie was playing with a rag
doll In the wings Just before her cue was
â¢ Â«poken, and waÂ» so absorbed in her child
;. lah vpleasure that she positively refused
to. go on; unless she could take her doll
. *ith her.- Fora few- minutes there was a
icene of the utmost consternation, and
'the ; matter:was finally compromised by *
-"promise on the part of. the distracted
' itage manager to give her the finest doll
â¢ ,.v that could ; be purchased in San Fran
cisco. This doll remained in Mrs. Flske's
: .possession for eighteen years, and, was
â¢ Â£ eold two years ago In a charity bazaar
In New York for' 5125.
..* >- : As a child actress Mrs. Fiske's most
.. ... r.otable achievement was In the great
. production of "King; John" at Booth's
U'heater, New. York. She was- the Prlnca
" Arthur in a cast that included John Mc-
Cullough, Junius - Brutus Booth and Ag
nes Booth. - Before attaining ' her four
teenth year Miss Maddern acted many of
the leading Juvenile parts, and occasion-
WHEN MRS. FISKE WAS KNOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO
AS THE "WONDER CHILD"
ally old women's parts, so remarkable
was her stage adaptability.
Long before she wore long dresses oft
the stage she wore them In the theater,
and It Is an actual fact that she played
the Widow Melnotte in "The Lady of
Lyons" at the ago of 13 and scored an as
tonishing success.
At Ifi Mrs. Flake was a full-fledged
star. Her last appearance in this city as
Minnie Maddern was at th? Alcazar,
twelve years ago, when she was seen in
"Caprice" and "In Spite of All." William
Faversham was her leading man.
. Reviewing Mrs. Flske's artistic career
before the footlights. It Is interesting to
note the several leading men and char
acter actors who have attained prom
inence through, her productions. When
Mrs. Fiskc. as Minnie Maddern. first went
starring her, leading man' was Harold
Forsberg. He was an excellent Robert
Macalre, and played innumerable other,
parts well. But for his alcoholic excesses
he might have reached a high place in
his profession. Forsberg was succeeded
by ..-Henry Miller, who in turn was fol
lowed, by Cj'ril Scott. When Mrs. Fiske
came under Steele Mackaye's manage
ment for her production ot "In Spite of
AH" the two principal male characters
Â¦were filled by Eben Plympton and Rich
ard Mansfield. 1 Both were featured on
the programme.' and Mrs. Fiske, the star.
was then billed as Miss Maddern. When
the play. was sent on the road the parts
originated by Mansfield and Plympton
Â¦were taken by old John' Jennings and
"William Faversham, respectively. Geof
frey Stein, who gave promise of develop- 1 *
ing into a really tine actor, was her next
leading man. but he never fulfilled the
promise of his early success. "Feather
brain" was Mrs. Flske's next important
production In New York, nnd her lead
ins; man was Wilton Lacknye.
After a brief retirement from th? stag*
the aÂ«:tre?s reappeared in an adaptation
of Daudet'a "L^. Menteuse." James .
KcOl, who had been with Crane, shared
loads with Frank Mills anJ Albert Gran.
Mills la now in London playing with Mrs.
Patrick Campbell. Gran has gone back
to Norway, his native country. trÂ» appear
in a blgr Ibsen revival. The following
season Mrs. Fisko put on "Tess" for tho
first time. The two leading roles fell to
Charles Coghlan and E. M. Tell. Cogh
lan went starring and Bell was dropped
from the cast. Frederick dc Bellevl'.la
and Forrest Robinson succeeded them.
Then John Craig, who played opposite
parts to Ada Rehan for several seasons
fct Daly's Theater, was engaged to re
place Forrest Robinson. Tyrone Power,
another graduate of Daly'3 Theater, waa
added to Mrs. Fiskes forces. . He waa
very successful in "Magrta," sharing tri
umphs with the" star through the per
Â¦ formance of Counselor von Kellar.
f Power ia now in Australia playing Aieo
iVUrbervnie in "Tess." with ,-h!s wife.
Edith Crane. Maurice Barrymore waa
Mrs. FUise's leading man last season.
All of/these actors, from Forsberg to
JCarrymore. have gratefully acknowl
etfsetl^the help and inspiration they have
received through, artistic association with

I of new books published In the United
J| States during 1S99-1900. "Wild Animals
I Have Known." by Ernest Seton-
Thompson, is placed among the twelve
most popular. Critics have been unani
mous In their praise of Mr. Thompson's
wonderful animal studies, both as an art
ist and a writer. It is not always that
the public coincides with the reviewers
of books, but In thla case. Judging by the
sales of his best work. It would seem that
the general reader has' been more than
pleased. ' . Â¦ â¢ .
Ernest Seton-Thompson was born In the
north "of England August 14, 1S60. of-Scot
tish parents. He waa educated In Eng
land and Canada. It was in 1SS2 that he
had threo years of farm life on the vast
plains, on Asslniboine, where he' lived
with bis brother in a little log shanty.
Hero he laid the foundation for his sub
sequent career. He is a naturalist born
and: bred In the bone, and it only needed
outdoor life and environment to bring out
all his latent talent. In 1SS3 he began his
first writing with some papers on zoology
of Manitoba, which resulted In his being
appointed Government Naturalist for that
province. ' ' Â¦
Finally his illustrations attracted tha
notice of the Century people and they en
gaged him to aid in illustrating the Cen
tury Dictionary. After finishing this
work of over 2000 drawings he went to
Paris Â¦ to' study art. Within a year he
had a prize-winner In tha Salon and was
In June. 1SD6. he married MI33 GracÂ© Gal
latin of the well known Galiatln family of
San Francisco. His wife takes an active in
terest in all hi3 work and accompanies
him on his trips. She is now writing and
illustrating on her ovm account along tba
lines followed by her husband, and has
done some work of a very creditable na
ture. Last year Mr. and Mrs. Beton-

ed considerable attentionâ especially onÂ»
called "Aw?Jted in Vain." which tells tha
tale of a woodcutter of the Pyrenees, who
Is devoured by wolves within sight oJ hia
home. .
Upon returning to America Mr. Seton-
Thompson went on a hunting expedition
to New Mexico. The result to the literary
world was his story of the old wolf Lobo.
who was lured to his death by hia whJta
mate Blanco. He soon went back to
Paris, feeling the necessity of more study
on the technique of art. He realized the
sore need of animal painters for tioma
work on the anatomy of the different wild
animals, and after four year3 of hard
work h.3 prepared a most valuable work
on this subject, which Is Illustrated with
some fifty lares plates of great interest
to the artist, but not so much to the pass
ing observer. It Is published under th*
title of "Art Anatomy of Animals."
Our teaching of a. forelem tnnitue is apt to
be too mechanical. The student miÂ»t be made

changes his position and looks at the unfold

Mrs. Clyde rinds that the seat of honor is
not given to herself, but to a young

his book is made up of original sugges

Four simple rules which the author gives

UNDER the modest title of "Mrs.
Clyde â the Story of a Social
Career," Julien Gordon has writ
ten one of the best society novels
that hns come out for many a day.
"Jyliei Gordon" !s the wife of Colonel S.
Van KeiiFselaer Crt-'ger and a leader in
New York society. It is said that the
book Is making a stir in the East, for it
!s hinted that Mrs. Clyde in fiction ha3
her counterpart in real life. In any event
Craser lias drawn the character of
her heroine too well to Le merely the cre
ation of her own brain. But Ftill It Is
more reasonable to suppose that Mrs.
Clyrfe is a composite rather than an exact
portrait.
Th* bnolt iÂ«, as the title .Fiiccests. a

girl who marries simply for wealth and
position: who fights her way into social

and lives to a f;iir!y good old age in the
midst of comforts and luxury. That is a

And eo her engagement is forthwith

Dearborn makes love to the young lady,
but finds when he actively presses his suit
that he has made one of the few mistakes
of his rapid life. He Is already a married
man. The reader at '.'lis point Is fully ex
pecting the usual turn of such beginnings
âa story of the weak country maiden
wronged and then developing into a
strong woman who peeks revengp. Not
yo â Mrs. Cruger is too skillful a writer to

THERE Is a tradition of the
Tower of London which says
that the ghost of Mary Queen
of Scots appears there always on
the Christmas eve preceding the
death of a King or Queen of England.
The day after Christmas there ap
peared in an English paper an item
stating that the ghost of Mary Queen
of Scots had been heard -walking and
\railing in the Tower of London. A
gruard had heard it and stoutly af
firmed this story.
The tale was telegraphed across tha
xeatsr subsequently and printed in
The Call of January 11, when as yet
there had been no thought of inter
ruption of the Queen's sturdy health.
Th<_ Tower cf London is a building
with a srloomy history. Close b3sid-i
it lies Tow^r Hill, where the numer
ous prisoners were led to execution.
It is indeed a Siting place for a trou
bled spirit to choose.
He had hear^d .that | the dead alone can*
come, and, go and no man â¢ see' them. ~ < Â¦
When the whilom ruddy, old guard was
through his search His .cheeks were as
white' as those of a frightened maid and.
his hand shook like the hand of one. He,
hurried to the outer door and. looked up
and down, trying to see some one. If
he could only catch sight of a human \
being, he thought, it â¢ would dispel; the!
creeps that were settling. upon him., 'Â¦
There was nobody about. Duty was I
duty. He was the appointed guard of the
Tower, and there was nothing, to do but
face the night out in the place. â¢
So until the day dawned, he remained, '
thinking over the- tales of the ghost of
Mary and listening for another sound of
it. None came, but: *
"That was enough," he says now.
"When I heard it I knew that our Queen's
death was to be .within -the' year. And .
that only last Chr^Jstmas eve,, and she
lying dead in her bed- at' Osborne. God
rest her soul, on the 22d of January. Oh,
It's a sorry monarch for whom the ghost
wails in the Tower." v
Since the time of .Elizabeth, persecutor
or rightful avenger of* Mary Stuart,
whichever she may have been, the ghost
has been reported to make itself heai-i
on each Christmas eve before the death of
the reigning monarch. Perhaps this is
an oil wives* tale. - . . ,
And yet, . do you wmember when tha
guard's etory-w.as given forth? On the'
The Ghost Of Mary Queen Of Scots
Mary Queen of Scots, so they say, Mary
of the sorry story, has always walked on
the Christmas eve before the ' monarch
died. ,
On second thoughts, the guard laughed
at himself for "his foolishness. What were
epooks to him? he queried. Naught but a
fancy, to have birth in idle minds, to be
prated of by idle tongues. Some one waa
putting up a joke on him. He would hunt
him OUt.
So he climbed the long Ftair flights,
panting like a good fellow as he did so.
The lop of the Tower was growing higher
each year, he had been noticing for some
time past. This year.' at the end of the
century, it must surely have grown above
the clouds.
After he had reached the top at the
end of arduous breathings, he clasped his
thumping old heart, gave it a final pat
of reassurance, ani looked about.
No one was to be seen. - .
"Oho! So you think you'll hide, do
you?" he queried In a fierce rumble that
might have "struck terror to the heart of
any practical joker. "I'll teach you to
hide." And thereupon he commenced a
search that began in the highest point of
the Tower and <lid not end until its bot
tom v.-;;s reached.
He found no one.
There could b p no mistake about it. No
living person could be above In that
Tower a:'d have passed him on the wav

5PASTURES HIS SHEEP BY ELECTRICITY.
A MAN named McNair has devised a
system of pasturing sheep by elec
tricity and experiments are being
made with it at the agricultural
experiment station of Michigan at'â¢Lan
sing. In recent j'cars nearly every town
of any size has been provided with an
electric generating plant and frequently
the wires are strung along country roads
from town to town. This fact led Mr. Mc-
Nair to attempt the use of electricity on
the farm. For sheep feeding he devised
a curious pen tome fifteen feet square,
built of wire and mounted on broad, flat
wheels. This pen is designed to run in
any pasture, even though it be hilly.
Wires connect with a small motor sta
tioned at one side of the pasture, this. In
turn, being connected with the electric
wires from which power ls derived. A
turn of a button and the pen slowly creeps
across the field. That is the essence of
the invention.
Two lambs and part of the time an old
ewe have- been pastured In the pen during
the summer at the station at Lansing.
The field is planted with lucerne, grow
ing thick and heavy. The pen isjeo ar
ranged that It crawls the full length of
the pasture in one month, traveling .about
two feet an hour; at the end of this time
it Is switched around and. travels back
again. As it. moves the sheep eat evory
bit of the fodder, eagerly cropping next
the forward side of. the pen as It runs over
new ground. A bit of canvas duck Is hung
over one corner of the pen so that the
sheep may be well sheltered, and, curious
as It may seem, they have become so ac
customed to the moving of the pon that
when they He down to sleep they snuggle
up close to the forward end of the pen so
that they may He as long as possible with
out being disturbed by the rear end of
the pen as it creeps toward them.
When the pen has , passed tile lucerne
that has been cropped by the sheep grows
up again and by the time the pen has
made its monthly circuit the " pasture is
again in good condition. The. advantage
of this electrical ptn is that the sheep
are . kept from running over, half-easing
and trampling down a' large amount of
pasture.and it keeps tho sheep quiet, bo
that they take on flesh, rapidly.

KING EDWARD'S CHAIR,
"This chair (commonly called St. Ed
ward's chair) is an ancient seat of solid
hardwood, with back and sides of -the
same, variously painted. In which , the
Kings of Scotland were in former periods
constantly crowned, but having been
brought out of the kingdom by
King Edward I in the* year
1296, after he had totally over

ever since remained in the Abbey of'West

DO animals understand the approach
of death? If so. <So they fear It?
Here is a problem which no Bden-
tist has ever yet settled, but upon
wfcleh French observer* have recently
thrown light.
To assume that the animal cannot un
derstand death because he cannot compre
hend the foolish things that men tay
about It Is to do him an injustice.
As a matter of fact it appears that ani
mals that do fear death have caught this
fear from human beings with whom they
hve mistakenly associated, and that the
wilder an animal it the more eerene and
dignified 1Â» bis attitude toward his own
dissolution.
Mort animalsâ with the exception of
those assured of decent burial In the back
yardâ have no reason to hope for raore
than prompt extinction and a slow whiten

All animals, according to the French
men who have Just been studying th^
eubject, realize when death Is near. Sav
ei?e beasts actually "prepare" for death
with a fine composure unshadowed by any
possibility of subsequent "will contests."
Bo-called domestic animals, while noi
ehowing the fear characteristic of
their masters, become ctrar.rely cling
ing and dependent and seem to dread sep
aration from the human belncs to whom
they are attached.
To eive definite Instances:
Pierre Lotl tells the following stcry of
the death of a young ape. partially tamed,
which he had mortallv wounded.

too feeble pulsation to make restoration
possible. Like a dead thing, I took It !n

tomary for kings to reside in the
Tower of London for some lime previous
to tho coronation. On the Saturday bo
fcre the coronation the sovereign wont
from Westminster to the Tower of Lon
don, attended by great numbers of the
nobility and civic dignitaries, and by
those pqulrcs who were to be knighted,
and who watched their arms that night.
Each squire had a chamber allotted him,
and a bath In which he bathed. The en
duing day after mass the sovereign
created them knights. After their inves
titure they were permitted to sit down in
the King's presence, but during the whole
time of dinner they were rot allowed to
partake of any part, of the entertainment.
The queens In their own right, Mary and
Elizabeth, though thry girded the pwords
on the knights with their own-hands, did
not give the accolade or blow, which Is
the determinate action that impresses the
character of knighthood. At both coro

WILLIAM THE Â«'ONQUEROR.
After William hail taken the coronation
oath, to protect the church, prohibit np
pr^^sion and execute judgment in mercy,
Aldrcd put the question, "Will ye have
this prince to be your king?" The people
answered with loud shouts, and the noise
geve so much alarm to the Norman garri
son in the city that the soldiers, believing
the Enclish to have revolted, without
vaitir.g to make any investigation, imme
diately set the next houses on lire, which,
spreading and giving a general alarm,
most of the congregation rushed out of
the church, the English hastening to stop
the fire and the Normans to plunder. The
bishops, clergy and monks, who remained
within the church, were in such confusion
that they were scarce able to go through
the ofnee of crowning the king. William
himself, who saw the tumult, and could
not conjecture its cause, sate trembling
at the foot of the altar, and, though no
great mischief was done by the fire. It
laid the foundation of a long and inveter-
HKNRY I!
ate enmity between the English and the
Normans.
WILLIAM II, RUFL'S.
William II laid claim to the crown by
virtue of a form of election, the nobles
believing that he would be less inclined
to control their usurped privileges than
Ills elder brother. Robert. He was
crowned at Westminster September 27,
l'S". by Lafranc. Archbishop of Canter
bury, and tho Archbishop of York. I?e
s'.nes swearing to observe justice, equity
and mercy in all his conduct, and to
maintain the prace, liberties and privil
eges of the church, he promised that he
would follow the Archbishop's counsels
in his administrations.
STEPITKN.
Tho coronation of Henry I was per
formed in a hurried manner on the fourth
day after the death of Rufus. In every
respect the forms of his coronation were
the Fame as those of the Saxon Kings.
The coronation nf Stephen after he had
sworn allegiance to the Empros3 Matilda
was viewed with much anxiety in an age
whrn it was supposed that the punish
ment of perjury was immediate | Â»nd visi
ble. The ceremony was performed by Wil
liam, Archbishop of Canterbury, and it
is said that a dreadful storm arose which
threw all the parties into such confusion
".hat the conspcratcd water fell on the
ground, the kiss of peace after tho sac
rament was omitted, and even, the final
benediction forgotten.
HENRY II,
Henry was crowned at Westminster on
thÂ«Â» Sunday before Christmas day, A. I">.
1154, by Theobald, Archbishop of Canter
bury. Although his hereditary right was
unquestionable, he was formally elected
by the clergy and people. It is said that
Henry was crowned again with his Queen,
A. D. llJ5fÂ». but this report arose from his
h.ivltsg worn the crown during the cere
mony.
RICHARD I.
Duke Richard, having made all neces
sary preparations for his coronation, camo
to London, where ho assembled the
Arrhbishops of Canterbury, Rouen and
Tours, -who had given him absolution In
Normany for waging war against his
father after he had taken the cross as a
crusader. First, the Archbishops, Bishops,
Abbotts and clergy, wearing .their square
caps and preceded by the cross and holy
water bearers and deacons burning, In
cense, Â¦went to the door of the royal bed
chamber and led the Duke in solemn pro
cession to the great altar of the church
of Westminster. When they reached the
altar Richard swore, in the presence of
the clergy and people on the holy gospel
and the sacred relics, that he would ob
serve peace, honor and respect all tho
days of his life to God, holy church and
its ordinances. His attendants then
stripped him to his trousers and shirt,
the latter of which was left open between
the shoulders on account of tho anoint
ing. Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury,
who -wore rich buskins of cloth of gold,
then anointed the King in three places,
on the head, between the shoulders and
on the right arm. A consecrated linen
coif and a cap of estate were then placed
forth at foure several places all the dale
long; neither was anle forbidden to re
ceive the same, were he never so poor or
ablest."
HENRY IV.
Henry IV was crowned by Archbishop
Fitzalan on the 13th of October. 1303. and
on this occasion the ampulla was first
employed. After Henry had gone to the
Tower he created forty-six Knights of
the liath, among whom were three of his
own sons. The procession from the
Tcwer to Westminster waa unusually
splendid, no less than six thousand
horses having been employed for the oc
casion.
Froissart gives the following acount of
Henry IVs procession: "The duke of
Lancaster left the Tower this Sunday af
ter dinner, on his return to Westminster.
He was bare-headed and had round his
neck the order of the king of France. The
prince of Wale3, six dukes, eix earls,
eighteen barons, accompanied him. and
there were of knights and other nobility
frcm eight to nine hundred horse in the
procession. He passed through the streets
of London, which were all handsomely
decorated with tapestries and other rich
hangings; there were nine fountains in
Cheapslde and other streets he passed
through that ran perpetually with white
and red wines. The whole cavalcade
amounted to six thousand horse, that es
corted the duke from the Tower to West
minster."
HENRY V.
Henry V was crowned on the 9th of
April, 1413. 'Katherine of France, tho
Queen of Henry V, was crowned on the
24th of February. 1420. The account which
Holinshed gives of the magnificence dis
played upon this occasion is far too char
acteristic of the age to be omitted:
"After the great solemnization of the
foresaid coronation in the church of St.
Peter's, at Westminster, was ended, the
queene was conveied into the great Hall
of "Westminster, and there set to dinner.
Upon whose right hand sat. at the end
of the table, the archbishop of Canter

royal viands. "Bore hedes In castellys oi

a lyopard of gold tyttyng therein, and
holding a flour* dÂ© Iyce." The pageant
for this course was "A sotyltle of Seynt

JOHN*.
upon his h*>.id and lie was vested with th<Â»
royal robes, the lamatic and the tunic.
The Archbishop then delivered him a
sword to restrain the enemies of the
church. Two Earls then buckled on his
Fpurs and invested him with the pall of
Ftate; after which Baldwin conjured
him in the natno of God and forbade him
to take the crown unless he were firmly
resolved in his heart and soul to observe
all the promises to which he had sworn.
The festivities were sullied by a san
guinary and disgraceful riot. Numbers
of Jews had flocked to England in the
rrign of Henry II, where they were hon
orably protected by that liberal and en
lighTpned sovereign. Grateful for such
unusual- favors, they assembled at Lon
don to subscribe themselves in order to
make Richard a splendid present on the
day of his coronation. Unfortunately
Richard was "persuaded by some of the
bigots who surrounded him that the Jews
were accustomed to practice magic on
sovereigns during the time of the corona
tion, and he therefore issued an edict
prohibiting any Jew from entering the
church while the ceremony was being
performed, or appearing at the palace
during dinner. Curiosity overcame pru
dence. . Several of the most considerable
Jews mingled with the crowd and gath
ered around the gates of the palace. One
of them, endeavoring to force an en
trance, was struck in the face by an over
zealous Christian. This signal aroused
tho fanaticism of the multitude. A gen
eral assault was made upon the Jews,
who fled In confusion toward the city.
Snmp wrPtches, oager for plunder, raised
a cry that the King had given orders for
the extermination of the unbelieving
Jews; and, as this was by no moans Im
probable, whm the King was a crusader,
it received implicit credit. The city mob.
swelled by the multitudes who had come
from the country, attacked the houses of
the Jews, which the inhabitants defended
with great courage and obstinacy. The
enraged populace, when night came on,
finding, that they could not break into
tho houses, hurled brands and torches on
the roofs and through the windows. Con
flagrations burst forth in various parts
of tho clty.i which consumed not only
the houses of the Jews but those of the
Christians. Richard caused several of
the ringleaders and most notorious male
factors to be apprehended the next day.
They were hanged, as a terror to others,
a proclamation was issued taking tho
Jews under the royal protection, and tho
tranquillity of the city was restored.
John ascended the throne, to the preju
dge of the hereditary rights of his
nephew, Arthur, by virtue of a form of
election. The Archbishops, Bishops.
E,arls, Bishops and others, the estates of
the realm, being assembled in the
church of "Westminster May 27. 1199, Hu
bert, Archbishop of Canterbury, ad
dressed them In these memorable words:
"Hear all men! It is well known to
your wisdom that no man hath any right
of succession to this crown unless he be.
elected for his own merits by the unani
mous consent of the kingdom, with invo
cation of the Holy Ghost, after the man
ner and similitude of Saul, . whom God
set over his chosen people, though he was
neither the son of a King nor sprung of
a royal line; â¢ and in like manner after
him David, the son of Jesse; the former
because he was brave and suited to the
royardlgnity. the latter because he was
humble and pious. So that he who sur
passes all within the realm in fitness for
royalty should preside over all In dignity
and power. But if one of the family
of the deceased sovereign should excel
others, his election should be the . more
readily and cheerfully conceded. Where
fore, as our late sovereign Richard died
without Issue of his body, and his
brother, Earl John, now present, is wise,
bravo and manifestly noble, we, having
respect both to his merits and his royal
blood, unanimously and with one accord
elect him to be our sovereign."
This was the most decisive form of elec
tion since the Conquest.
HENRY III.
After the death of John, London being
In possession of tho French Prince Louis.
an assembly of tho principal authorities
was convened at Winchester under the
presidency of Gualo,' the papal legate.
They unanimously resolved that the
young King should be crowned on the
2Sth day of October, A. D. 1216. The cere
mony was performed in the cathedral of
Winchester. The Papal Legate compelled
.Henry to do homage to the holy Roman
church and Pope Innocent for his king
dom of England and Ireland ; he also
made him swear that he would pay an
annual tribute of one thousand marks ta
the papal see. The ceremony of corona
tion was repeated by Stephen Langton,
Archbishiop of Canterbury.
Early In the year 1236 Henry married
the Lady Eleanor, daughter of the Earl
of -Provence, whose beauty is j celebrated
by all the chroniclers.
The ceremony of her coronation was
performed with extraordinary pomp on
the 22d of January. Hollnshed's account
of It will no doubt gratify our readers:
"At the solemnitie of this feast and
coronation of the quene all the high peers
of the realm both splrituall and temporall
were present, there to. exercise their of
fices as to them appertelned. The citizens
of London were there in. great arrale,
bearing afore . hir in solemn wise three
hundred and three score cups of gold and
silver, in token that - they ought to /wait
upon hir cup. Archbishop of Canterburie

The feast was'plentifull, Pn that nothing
wanted that could be wished. Moreover

by the space of eight dales together."
On the 15th of August. 1274, Edward I
and his Qurcn. Eleanor, were crowned at
Westminster by the Archbishop of Can
terbury, aided by other prelates.
Holinshed adds some remarkable par
ticulars of this coronation:
"At this coronation were present Alex
ander king of Scots, and John earle of
Bretaino, with their wives that were sis
ters to King Kdward. The king of Scots
did homage unto Kin?? Kdward for the
realme of Scotland, In like manner as
other the kings of Scotland before him
had doone to other kings of England, an
cestoures to this King Edward. At the
solemnitie of this coronation there were
let go at Hbertie (catch them that catch
might) five hundred great horses by the
king of Scots, the earles of Cornewall,
GlocÂ«\ster. Pembroke, Warren and others,
as they were allighted from their backs."
EDWARD II.
Edward II and his Queen were crowned
at Westminster on the 21th of February.
Holinshed informs x us: "There was such
pressp and throng at the coronation that
a knight, called Sir John Bakewell, was
thrust or crowded to death." The Bish
ops were incommoded and forced to hur
ry through the service in a slovenly man
ner, and yet it was not concluded before
3 in the afternoon. -â¢'
EDWARD III.
On the deposition of Edward II h*3 son.
Prince Edward, was brought to a. gen
eral assembly of the nobles and clergy
in the abbey church at Westminster, on
the 20th January, 13*^7. and Walter Rey
nold exhorted all present to choose the
young Prince as their sovereign. All as
sented, but the Prince himself declared
that he would not accept the crown until
it had been voluntarily resigned by his
father.
A remarkable coronation medal was
struck on this occasion; on onÂ© side the
young Prince was represented crowned,
laying his scepter on a heap of hearts,
with the motto, "Populo dat -Jura vo
lonti" (Mo gives laws to a willing people);

The coronation of this King -was more
magnificent than any of the preceding.
The procession of the King from the
Tower of London is thus described by
Holinshed:
"The citle was adorned In all sorts
most richlle. The water conduits ran
with wine for the space of three hours
together. In the upper end of Cheapo was
a certain castell, made with foure towers;
out of which castell, on two sides of It,
ran forth wine abundantly. In the tow
ers were placed four beautiful virgins, in
stature and age like to the king-, appar
elled in white vesture. In every tower
one, the which blew in the king's face, at
his aproaching near to them, leaves of
gold; and as he approached also they
threw on him and his horse counterfeit
florins of gold. When he was come be
fore the castell they "took cups of gold,
and filling- them with wine at the spouts
of the castell, presented the same to the
kin? and his nobles. On the top of the
castell, betwixt the four towers, stood a
golden angell, holding a crown in his
hands,' which was so contrived that when
the king came her bowed down and of
fered to him the crowne. In the midst of
the king's pallace was a marble pillar,
raised hollow upon steps, on the top
whereof was a great gilt eagle placed un
der whose feet in the chapiter'of the pil

THE CORONATION OF ENGLAND'S KINGS AND QUEENSThe ampulla, which contains the holy
oil,' Is in the form of an eagle, with tfio
wings expanded, standing on a pedestal,
all of pure gold, finely chased. The head
unscrews at the middle ot tho neck for
the convenience of putting in the oil, and
the vessel being entirely hollow, it is
poured out into the spoon through the
point of the beak. The weight of tho
whole is nearly eight or ten ounces, and
the cavity of the body is capable of con
taining about six ounces. The anointing
spoon is likewise of pure gold, with four
pearls set in the broadest part of handle;

rV|7 TKOLA TESLA has come to the
|n front with another wonderful in
li U ventlon. Having opened telegraphic
and heliographic communication
with Mars, Tesla is now re,ady to furnish
the world with a new energy which ho
calls "Impressed force," or "every man
his own earthquake." According to Tesla's
description this "impressed force" is
something weird. He says:
"My experiments iri electrical and me
chanical vibration have impressed me
deeply with the tremendous possibilities
of Impressed force. With a small engine,
capable of pressing a piston baCk and
forth with a force of but two pounds,* I
have set an entire block of modern build
ings, by careful attunement. Into such a
violent swaying that people rushed out
affrighted. Within impressed force of
only a fraction of a pound I have caused
steel rings of several square lnrhei cro?s
section, capable of supporting several
hundred tons, to vibrate and form loons,
like thin piano wires, until they finally
broke."
Clearly Mr. Tesla has the world at his
mercy. If. "with a small engine capable
of pressing a piston back nnd forth with
a force of but two pounds." he can shake
solid blocks of buildings in this manner,
what is to prevent him some morning when

swain get behind good St. Valentine to
make a declaration of love.
"Neither Is It good form to make It a
spite day. The comic valentine, when the
Joke la kind. Is all right, but when one is
sent that Is insulting and personal It goes
against the spirit of the day.
"The once popular lace-trimmed valen
tines are a thing; of the past. Children
have taken possession of these. ; The lover
now sends his lady fair an offering of
flowers, bonbons, fruit', a book,* a picture
or any dainty holiday gift. Where an en
gagement exists often a piece of jewelry
is sent.
"It is considered better taste not to put
any. card on valentine gifts. The Identity
of the sender should be shrouded In doubt.
This adds piquancy to tha occasion. Of
course the woman in the case is usually
a good guesser.
"There Is only one time-honored way to
send any card or comic velentin**. and
that is to have it slipped under the door
on St. Valentine eve. It must not under
any circumstances be Intrusted to Uncle
Sam. and have the prosaic adornment of a
. postage stamp unless the sender lives at
a distance. Then It is pardonable because
Unavoidable, but a part of the flavor Is
lost when it haw to come through such a
channel. Even flowers and candy are left
on the doorstep by a messenger boy, who
runs away In the friendly darkness and
watches from a. distance to see that the
offering is taken in.
"The etiquette of valentines decrees that
no woman shall make a present to eveu,
her dearest female friend on this day.
nor must a man give anything to another
man. .This does not apply to comic valen
tines, but to presents of any description.
It is a. day sacred to lovers, and no one
else must trespass on their privileges.
Neither does a woman remember a man
friend with even the most trifling nouve
nir. There is no hint of leap year prerog
atives in this old-faahloned day."
he feels disgruntled with the world from
bringing the whole world In ruins about
the ears of its inhabitants? With his "Im
pressed force of only a fraction of a
pound" he could -twist the Brooklyn bridge
into a broken mass of. steel.
Continuing his interview In the Western
Electrician, Mr. Tesla says:
"In electrical vibration I have frequent
ly obtained results even more wonderful.
The tunins of electric circuits la becom
ing more and more important with thÂ»
advancement of arts and refinement of
methods. The layman can have but a
vague idea of what can be accomplished
in this line by men possessed of knowledge
and skill. As to the former. It la acquired
easily enough. The principles are very
simple and do not require an exceptlonallr
high scientific training. Perhaps thÂ»
clearest expositions have been given by
j Dr. Oliver Lodg* and Professor Pupln.
The latter particularly was fortunat* la
dealing with the subject, and a beginner
can nnd no better source of information.
"But the skill is not acquired as quickly
or as easily as the knowledge of ths sim
ple printiplea. It comes slowly, requires
great patience and untiring application.
Owing to this fact, of necessity but few
are proficient in the art to-day. This is
the reason why the greater part of con
temporaneous literature on the subject ts
pervaded. with thÂ« grossest errors, ilany

an elettricat system cannot vibrate
through an imperfect contact or path of
i high resistance. SUI1 many more overlook
the r.eÂ«'cj*Â«Ity of phicing th>Â« excited system
in a rendition permitting- free oscillation,
yet everybody knows that If he grins a
spring lirmiy arid pushes it back and
forth It cannot perform Its own vibrations.
Similarly, an exc-ited "'-ctrical Â¦ystem, as
the secondary of a transformer, cannot

VICTORIA.
The arrangements for the coronation
of .William IV and- Queen Adelaide were
a compromise between economy and pa.
rade. The procession from the Hall to
the Abbey and the coronation feast In the
Hall were omitted. The popular enthu
siasm was greater, however', than on any
former occasion. The new entrance to
St. James Park was opened for the first
time, and In the evening tho metropolis
was universally Illuminated. The very
lanes and alleys tenanted by the poor

affection of even thÂ« humblest for "the

"The box assigned to the foreign embas
sadors presented a most brilliant effect,
and was perfectly In a blaze with dia

Prince Estcrhazy, in particular, he glim
mered like a galaxy. An honest Persian
was also a remarkable figure, from fcne
dogged and impenetrable gravity with
which he looked on the whole scene, with

the space of four hours. Like Sir Wilful

else there was a Mohammedan paradise
extended on hia right hand along the
seats which were occupied by the peer
esses and their daughters, which' the
prophet himself might have looked on
with emotion."
"The effect of the scene in the Abbey
was beyond measure magnificent. The
altar surrounded by tho fathers of the
churchâ the King encircled by the no
bility of the land and the councilors of
his throne, and by warriors, wearing the
honored marks of distinction bought by
many a glorious danger â add to this the
rich spectacle of the aisles crowded with
waving plumage and coronets, and caps
of honor, and the sun. which brightened
and saddened as if on purpose, now beam
ing in full luster on the rich and varied
assemblage, and now darting, a solitary
ray, which catched, as It passed', the glit
tering folds of a banner, or the edge of a
group of battle-axes or partizans, and
then rested full on some fair form 'the
cynosure of neighboring eyes,* whose cir
clet of diamonds glistened under its in
fluence. Imagine all this, and then tell
me If I have made my journey of four
hundred miles to little purpose.
The account of this coronation given by
Sir Walter Scott is so graphic and lively
that we think It will gratify our readers
to insert an abridgment of It.
During the coronation feast the King
acknowledged the different sen-ices per
formed according to ancient usage very
graciously, save only when tho cup of
wine was presented by the Lord Mayor
and citizens of London. His Majesty
treated these gentlemen with marked
coolness, and did not acknowledge their
service by any salutation.
A special act of Parliament was passed
to enable the Duke of Norfolk, who was
a Roman Catholic, to perform the func

coronation. He also, \ as premier peer of
England, returned thanks for the sover

speak German, en that the ceremonies

James' coronation, April 23. 16K3, was
celebrated with so much splendor that It
rendered him for a considerable tipie pop

anecdote connected with the solemnity is
that, on the King's return from the ab
bey, the crown tottered upon his head,
and would havÂ« fallen off had not the
Hon. Henry Sidney supported It, saying.
"This is not the first time our family have
supported the crown."

scarcely less offensive than the sermon.

Charles II, having been Invited to Scot

plon a most "extraordinary sermon was
preached by "Master Robert Dowglas,
minister at Edinburgh, moderator of the
General Assembly, from 2 Kings xl.
Verses 12-17." The preacher delivered a
fierce philippic against the young King's
father and mother, the latter of whom
he compared to the wicked Athallah.
CHARLES II.
In the year 1632 Charles I went to be
crowned King of Scotland at Edinburgh.
He was received with great splendor, and
several pageants were prepared to honor
his reception. The most singular was a
triumphal arch, under which a mountain
was raised in the form of a theater,
upon which sat a nymph, representing
the genius of tho cltyÂ« of Edinburgh^
"Shee was attired in a soa greene velvet
mantle; her sleeves and under roabe of
blew tissue, with blew buskins on her
feete; about her necke shee wore a
chaine of diamonds; the dressing of her
head represented a castle with turrets;
her locks dangled upon her shoulders."

as a blind old woman, covered with rag?.
On the left hand stood Justice, In "a red

fierce acpecte, in armes, but broken all
and scattered."
The coronation of Charles I was delayed
until the 5th of February; 1G26, in conse
quence of the plague, which then reigned
In London. The principal novelty was tlie
introduction of v the following clause in

Among the city pageants the most re
markable was that of St. Paul's Cath
cdial, thus described by Holinshed:
"There was one Peter, a Dutchman, that
stood on the weathercock or Paule'n
Eteeple, holding a streamer in his hand
of five yards long, and waiving thereof,
stood sometimes on the one foot and
snooke the other, and then kneeled on his
knees, to the great marvell of all people.
Up had made two scaffolds under him.
one about the crosse. having torches and
streamers pet on" it, and another over the
ball of the crosse, likewise set with
streamers and torches, which could not
burn, the wind was so great. The said
Peter had sixteen pounds, thirteen shil
lings, four pense for his costes, and
palnes. and aJl his stuffe."
Mary, the first female sovereign of this
realm, was crowned on the 1st of Octo
ber, 1553. by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop ol
Winchester, the Archbishops of York
and Canterbury being then prisoners In
the Tower. On the last day of September
she went In state from the Tower to
Westminster In an open chariot, drawn
by six horses, covered with cloth of tis

cess Elizabeth and tho I,ady Anne of

7CURIOUS ORIGIN AND VARIETY OF
MEANINGS OF "HODGE PODGE"
FEW words in the English language
have such a Variety' of meanings
and spellings as . hotch-potch.
Hotch-potch, notch-podge, hotch
pot, hodge-pocch, hodge-podge, hodge
pot, and every other conceivable combina
tion of the syllables contained in those
words may be found In literature and
heard In conversation.
Nowadays, it is chiefly used by children
to designate a game which they play on
the sidewalk, on which Is roughly drawn
in chalk the required form. The game Is
quite popular In New York, and 'on a
summers day, there is hardly a block
withoutLlts hodge-podge game, the chalk
marks used in them remaining until the
rain washes. them off.
The word3 hodge podge are also used
by the Scotch to denote a certain kind of
pudding - made up of numerous kinds of
ingredients.
But the words are really of legal origin.
In olden times it was the custom of a
father to give a daughter a portion of his
estate fpr her "advancement in marriage."
If\ upon his death, he left the rest of his
estate to his children proportionately, the
one .to whom the marriage. portion had
nanas for the sickroom that there was a
division of opinion In Mulberry street as
to whether, he was cheering his- friend's
finale with. fruit or . endeavoring to com
plicate consumption with* other* Ills.
At last he swallowed his last flagon of
Chianti, and though Little Italy made a
decent pretense of sorrow, It was really
en feteâ at last the $800 was to be drawn!
I was in the bank. when , the principals, in
their holiday 'clothes "and with a few
chosen friends, arrived. They'stated the
case and asked for- the amount, from
which the pushcart man was to receive
some $40 for fruit, the wine seller $100 and
the others various sums invested for the
invalid and his funeral, leaving some $350
as the "dividend." I need not describe the
small-sized riot that- followed when the
abstraction of the pages from one side of
the book was explained to the swearing
mourners and a tender was made to them
of the ?15, all that the deceased had In

An Estimate of the Future Tremendou s Output of
Coal Mines in the United States.
THE British coal output having now
reached, a total of 220,000,000 gross
tons, from an area of about ; 8000
square miles, the opinion Is preva
lent that the maximum output of that
country Is within sight. This being the
case, the question naturally arises,, . How
does the Â¦ situation In the United .States
compare with this, and what will be. our
maximum tonnage? Our coal areas of
the United States comprise upward, of
150,000 square miles, so that so . far - as
area Is concerned we have fifteen times
as much coal lands as. Great. Britain, and
the Impression might prevail that in due
time the United States might produce ten
times, at least, as much coal.. Yet. this
is subject to marked modification, al
though thirty-five years ago the total
' â¢ -. /; "â¢ -r -Â¦ â¢Â¦â¢,
coal production of the United States did
not exceed 25,000,000 tons and to-day it is
at the rate of 230,000,000 tons per annum.
Pennsylvania now produces at the rate of
135.000,000 tors per annum. It ' is .very
doubtful if the output will ever be more
than twice as much as it is now. or let
US-say, 300,000,000 tons. Illinois, too,' has
an ultimate output ; of 60,000,000 tons, or
two and a half times the present tonnage.
West Virginia may in time produce
three times Its present output. For Ohio
a" total output of 35,000,000 is all that can
be expected. Alabama we shall "enter fas
70.000,000 tons.: Indiana may produce 10,
000,000 tons .fifty or seventy-five years
hence,, but at that time' Maryland may
be worked out, or nearly so, and * if we
continue' that State at 'its present figure
we i shall â¢ be generous. \ Let â¢ us. put down
20.000,000 tons for Iowa and , the same ; for
Colorado. Kentucky will be a large pro-
ducer, and 15.000,000 tons may come thence.
Kansas "and Missouri will, probably not
increase so much: 10,000,000 for the two
is our estimate. Tennesseewill probably
produce as much as both, and so will Wy
oming. For Washington and Virginia we
may set ' down 6,000,000 tons each. The
Montana output may run up to the same
figure,' and the 'Indian Territory and Ar
kansas tonnages may reach 5.000.000 tons
apiece. New Mexico may produce 4,000,003
tons per annum in time, so also with
Texas and Utah.,; Michigan will proba
bly never exceed 2.000,000, and 1,000,000 for
Georgia is a liberal estimate. California,
North and South Dakota', Oregon, North
Carolina, Nebraska and Rhode Island may
allJbe jointly credited with a product - of
1,000,000 - tons. Here. - then, we have a
total of a 60,000.000 tons as the ultimate
maximum output o* thÂ» coal mines of

He had taken a step toward the stage
when the Bad Boy. overcoming with an
effort his love of fun.- laid a restraining
hand on the old .man's shoulder and ad
vised him to wait till some time when
the audience didn't happen to be looking.
Then the Bad Boy left the old man to
his own devices and wandered off In
search of a friend. Before the Old Gro
ceryman could fairly recover his breath
at the sight of so much beauty the act
came to an end and the girls trooped oft
â¢yie, stage. As a bevy of girls passed near
where he steod the old man was so over
awed by the near approach of such a
galaxy of beauty that' he gasped out
aloud:
"My goodness, gracious me! I'm liable
to fall out of bed and wake up In a min
ute!" ' â¢
The girls turned as they heard his
Western accent and as they caught sight
of his gayly decked figure they set up a
perfect shout of amusement.
"Young ladles." remarked the Old
Groceryman. bowing as much as possible
after the style of a picture he had once
seen of "The Meeting Between Lafayette
and Martha Washington." and laying his
hand on his heart, "young ladies, you be
hold In roe a rich and wealthy Western
capitalist whose only object In life is
to spend -money In promotin* theatrical
ventures. I'm, here to send you all out
with companies of your own at fab'lous
salaries. Gee! but I'm rich. Why. I
reckon I mu3t be worth In all more'nâ
more'n J3000." naming the largest sum ha
could for the moment Imagine.
A shriek of laughter from tha ctrts fol
lowed his words, and they flocked around
him In a crowd, one of them pulllnsr his
whiskers and telling him to say "Ba-a-a!"
while another annexed his two huga roses
and a third asked him If he hadn't better
give her the whole $3000 so the other girls
wouldn't feel too stuck up.
The Old Groceryman took all this chaf
fing good naturedly, thinking he'd made a
tremendous hit, and when one pretty girl
asked him for a lock of his whiskers as a
souvenir he answered gaJlantly:
"Why, to be sure, miss! Only you must
give me a kiss first."
â¢Sure. Rube!" laushed the girt, "only
you've got to catch me to get It." And
she flitted away with the other girls to
the dressing-room, where they had to
change their costumes In a hurry for th*
next act.
The Old Groceryman with outstretched
arms ran after her to claim, tha promised
kiss, but he lost sight of her a.t the first
turning and ran back and forth, peering
vainly into dark corners In search of her.
At last he spied In one dim nook, the flut
ter of a. dreaa. Kudhing un. be caugb:
hold of Its wearer, exclaiming, "Ah, you
giddy little thing! You couldn't hldei from
me." and kissed her twite.
"Do It again; 1 like that." mumbled a
voice, and as he drew his prize oat int.*
the light he saw she was not the chorus
girl he sought, but the aged, toothless
scrubwoman attached to tha theater.
"Hello, there!" cried the Bad Boy, ap
pearing suddenly. "Have you found your
rich, widow at last?"
"No, I ain't!" thundered thÂ» Old Gro
;eryman in disgust, dropping the scrub
woman's arm and seizing tha Bad Boy.
"But the loveliest-Iookin' Kirl you eve
saw has promised me a kiss If I can only
find her. You just come along and help
me now."
And he started off again In his lore
quest, dragging the convulsed Bad Boy la
his > wake.
At last they camÂ» In sight of the itagi
again. The second act was on and th*
Old Groceryman spied his charmer slng-
Ing In the front row of tne chorus, and
with a wild whoop of triumph he rushe-i
out of the wings straight on to tha stags
toward her. dragging the mortified and
struggling Bad Boy and shouting:
"I've caught you! I've caught youl" as
with the Bad Boy still trailing along In
his' grasp he bore down upon t ho, amazed
girl. "And now I'm acoin' to havs that

Groceryman flung both arms about thÂ«
girl and planted a. loud, fervent. smacking
kiss on her lips.
There was & squeal from thÂ» girl, m, howl

f-. r HE Old Groceryman's ardor for seeing
' the town was somewhat dampened
IÂ» by his experience at the Chinatown
theater, in the course of which he
had bpoom* smitten by the charms of a
Celestial actress, who turned out to dp a
man and who chaser] him out Into tTH
street and relieved him of a handful of
his cherished chin whiskers.
At first, -as ho brooded over his misfor
tunes, the Old Oroceryman felt Inclined
to blame the Ra<J Boy for the catastrophe,
but on mature deliberation he decided
that he had. only his own foolishness to
thank and at last .became reconciled to
his companion' ami smiled on him as Â«>f
yore.
Inuring the next two ilays. while the old
man was petting used t-i the lonesom*
feeling produced by the loss of so many
Â«{ his trhiskers and was battling agalnj-t
the serration caused by the chop suey and
I Tehee nuts he had eaten, and which were
roFtive and nnbappy arsons their new and
anti-Cclcstial surroundings, the Bad Boy
Â«aÂ« unfailing in his attentio.-.s as nurr-e
and foxnfnrter lo his old friend and
seemed stricken by some mysterious re
morse.
Ore? or twice the Had Boy timidly sue
jrestetj some expedition, but the Old
Groderyman sternly vetoed them all, anl
paid he'd rather stay home and put hi*
feet up on the table and nibble away at
some crackers and moldy cheese, whicn
he produced from a far-off corner of his
carpet liag. ar.d which he said made him
almost imagine he was back !n the dear
gM grocery at home.
The Bad Boy. on seeing the old man
eating these home dainties, once said he
had m^ant to take the Old Grocerymafl
up to the Metropolitan Museum some day,
but that now the ancient Egyptian mum
mies and other antiquities would seem too
modern to them after that prehistoric
cheese.
At last the Old Groceryman began to
feel better, and the champagne-like nir
of New York again got Into his brain, po
when the Bad Boy said he had a friend
who was the press agent for the "Nora
core" company up at the Pinochle Thea
ter on Broadway, and that the press agent
would give them a note admitting them
behind the scenes some evening, the Old
Oroceryman showed strong signs of con
vajesccr.ee.
"Any rich girls or millionaires' widders
at rod) a place?" he asked cautiously.
"1-ots of them'." declared the Bad Bey.
"There are more pretty girls there in ora
minute than you'd see at home in seven
years."
"But maybe they won't care about mak
ing friends with me," Kald the OKI
Groceryman. and he looked as if he'd
like to be contradicted.
"Sure they will:" the Bad Boy declared.
'"And I'll tfll 'era you're a Western capi
taliFt who has retired from business an-J
Â¦wants to start half a dozen theatrical
companies and pay gilt-edged salaries." â¢
"That'll make 'em think I'm foolish,
won't it?" <iueri*xl the old man. dubiously.
"Ifll make them think you're an angel."
retorted the Bad Boy, but the Old Gro
icrymnn missed :he poini.
Then the Bad Eoy went on to explain
that ruch an announcement would make
the chorus girls and actresses flock
around the Old Groceryman like flies
around ore of the latter's own molasses
Jugs back in the old grocery, and told
him how jolly it was behind the scenes,
and how much it looked like fairyland
liecause there were lots and lots of
â¢fairies," and he'd be sure to "land" a
Jew. And then the Old Groceryman be
pan to wake up in earnest to the idea-
It was a little after 8 that evening when
the Bad Boy. in faultless evening dress,
convoyed the Old Groeeryman up Broad
way. The old man was clad In his trusty
dress suit (vintage of 'S3) and wore two
enormous American Beauty roses (at $1 50
apiece), one in each lapel. He had at first
bought a single enormous rose, but . he
Â¦thought that Rave him a lop-sided look,
end he bought a second rose for the other
elde of his coat.
His coattails had been damaged beyond
recall In his adventure at the Metropoli
tan Opera-house; so, in accordance with
h. suggestion of the Bad- Boy. he had
neatly sheared off the tails, shaving the
rough edges with his razor.
The Bad Boy had rapturously declared
that the result of this amateur tailoring
was the most fashionable and. unique
Tuxedo jacket In all New York.
On one point in the Old Groceryman's
attire the t wo bad quarreled, and the old
man bad won. He bad Insisted (In spite
of the Bad Boy's objections) that a plain
white shirt front looked too much like a
tombstone on a holiday, and had pur
chased on his own responsibility a glori
ously gaudy shirt whose purple bars al
ternated with stripes of vivid scarlet. This
he wore with conscious self-approval, and

THE Italian colony of New Tork sup
plies this anecdote to a paper In the
February Century, entitled "Humor
â¢ and Pathos of the Savings Bank":
An old Italian street vender, a con
sumptive, feeling; that his end was draw
ing near, prepared a scheme for ending
his days in comfort. Observe the origin
ality and delicacy of the scheme that he
successfully worked on Little Italy. He
had only $75 in the bank, and of this he
drew $70 and redeposited it In a few
dsÂ«.ys. He drew it again, and again rede
posited it. continuing the operation at
brief intervals, until on the credit side of
his pass-book he had entries of all these
various sums footing up $VK), and on the
cpposlte page drafts to the amount of
about $785 â balance US. After carefully
cutting out the page showing the
amounts drawn, and leaving the long line
ot deposits, he took to his bed and called
In his friends. He was dying; they'could
tee that, the old man told them.
They were good fellows, and he loved
them all, and he wished Pedro, the ba
nana peddler, and good Giovanni, the
bootblack, and Arthur, the wine seller, to
know how affectionately . he retarded
them. What he had to leave them was
not muchâ would Edgardo, good old Ed
gardo, kindly find, between the mattress
and what used to be the springs, his bank
book? Yes, that was It. Take it to the
window and tell him how much was there.
Eight hundred? Ah, well, thanks to God
that it was so much; but, oh, that it were
more, for such good fellows as they!
Dottore Bartollo had told him that he
might live three monthsâ till spring.
Would his good friends put back his book
under the mattress, and when he wfis
goneâ no, they mustn't cryâ would they
take it up to the bank, draw the amount
and divide it between them? Meanwhile,
as his lovin'g friends of the present, his
heirs In the future, would they kindly at
tend to his little wants?
; Would they? Did they? That old fellow
was fed on the fat of the land while he
lay there in bed. He drank more Chianti
In a week than he had swallowed In five
years. It was even hinted by some that
Arturo. the wine seller, was hastening the
end by the vile Chianti that he constantly
produced from his stock, while the push
cart man was so generous of unripe ba-

This was denominated, bringing: those
lands Into hotch-pot. If, however, she
thought that she would be the loser by to
doing, she could retain the lands she had
at first received intact.
Just why this custoBx received the name
of hotch-pot does not appear, but In an
old English textbook the following: ex
planation is found: "It seexneth that this
word hotch-pot Is7ln English a pudding;
for In a pudding is not commonly put onÂ«
thing alone, but one thing with other
things together."
By this was meant that the marriage
portion and the lands subsequently de
scending should first be QxeTJ and blended
together and then equally divided among:
the sisters. The word hodge-podge Is now
most commonly used to designate any
kind of mixture, although what relation
that meaning of the word has to the gams
as played by our Anwriran children la not
very apparent.

moment there was a hard struggle â the
woman fighting as folk only do when
there is life or death in it.
. Then Ruthlne turned over on his back,
having twisted the woman's arms behind
her. Close beside him as he swam a white
lifebuoy bobbed placidly in the water. It
was attached to a rope and kept pace with
his progress. The quartermaster on watch
on the main deck knew his business thor

The woman scarcely struggled now,"; for
nhe was a close prisoner â her arms twist
ed behind her back, her head well up on
Ruthine's chest and free of the water. .
Her hair,, which had come adrift, was
spread all over Ruthine's face.
./â¢You are breaking my arms," she
gasped, and U13 voice was that of a lady.
"Can't help it," answered the rescuer,
mindful of the Mahanuddy's' reputation;.
The- .quartermaster had lowered', the

of it awaiting their arrival. . .-,

for he had caught sight of a shadowy
form hurrying Id that direction. Then ho
heard a splash. The quartermaster on
watch on the main deck heard it also and
ran toward the gangway.
"All right," whispered Ruthine. seizing
him by the arm. "I know where Bhe

He went over the rail just as he was,
and the sound of his fall was no louder
than that of a seal taking the water from

lantern glared persistently on a gray
shadow stirring the water under the stern,
and Ruthine went there at the quick side

Johnson fell in love with youns Stanford
â wbo was "In tea" if you please â and was
not careful to conceal her misfortune. It
was. moreover, the doctor who told Grind

wrong about the yellow cow's milk, and
conveyed to Mr? 1 . Judge Barrowby that
when Stanford had muttered audibly of
â¢â¢iiiK-rferins old cats," he had referred to
lhat upstart Lady Smith, of Golden Gulch,

there, the vices developed there, the dis

relatives at home are usually enabled to

stitution was much impaired before he

Dr. Ruthine. for reasons of his own,
took a deep interest in human nature as
rueh, and had certain methods of watch
ing o\or Â«ociety'a failures until, with a
F'.gh of relief, he raw them stumble down
the gangway at last. He was not only
charitably disposed toward tnem, but be

however, the doctor averted several un- c
pleasant incidents, nnd the reputation of
the MahanaddÂ»y increused a thousand

It faappened on a homeward voyage that
'J~.<* steamer lay one night at anchor at

admitted by Ruthine, who shot the bolt
again. . â¢ ' :,
The captain of the Mahanaddy was a
small man. with a pointed gray beard and
thoughtful blue eyes of a quiet expression.
He was reported to possess great endur
ance and strength, and the eye of knowl
edge In such matters could scarcely fall
to notice the depth of his chest. He looked
at Mrs. Mallwaner, and. then at Ruthlne,
who was wiping his face with a handker
chief.
' "This lady has Just attempted to com
mit suicide," said the doctor, and he
handed Mrs. Mallwaner a towel.
â¢There were men in the forecastle who
averred, in the picturesque language of
thatpart of a vessel, that they would
rather perform three weeks' hard labor
tha'n<face the skipper's wrath. A few
explanations put this autocrat in posses
sion of the facts of the case and then the
captain of the Mahanaddy rose up in his
anger and fell on Mrs. Mallwaner. He ex
pounded to -her the law pertaining to at
tempted suicide and Mrs.' Mallwaner'3
pretty face turned rather gray. Then he
said other things in a, quiet voice that
niade her sob, and when he closed his
oration. . the little, lady was- shivering on
the sofa; But she had not told them why
she did itâ nor yet could they extract
from her. a promise noÂ£ to do the same
again. Â¦ ' " ' Â¦ . Â£Â¦'?*? s '
So Mrs. Mallwaner, who was traveling
alone, found herself transferred to a very
pleasant deck cabin of a central position,
and lighted bya skylight only. Thither,
in a marvellously short time, the head
stewardess 'brought her possessions , from
the second-class cabins. Â¦- Theae â¢ posses
sions were of a refined quality. The silver
fittings of her, dressing bag bore a crest.
Ruthine noted theso matters when he
visited ) the lady , professionally : the. . next
morning after breakfast, which" had been
served to her In' her new apartment. He
found her restless and more excited than
on ; the Â¦' previous night. .Indeed, .^ sho

proved her to be indignant and defiant
still- ' â¢ ...-â¢â¢ .' .
-'.'The captain thinks," she said, "that he
can say anything to me because I am
traveling alone, and second class, but he
will tind out that, he is mistaken. My
husband is obliged m to remain, with his
regiment and I am traveling home second
class because my little girl has had a long
illness and must now undergo a most ex
pensive operation. In India. we know all
the best people, and 1 shall take care that
they hear of this affair."
"X hope," replied Ruthine, quietly, "thit
nothing we have said or done has ap
peared to convey that we ever had thw
slightest doubt of your social position.
Mis. Mallwaner." â¢ ' â¢ - -
The lady bit her lip and vouchsafed no
answer. So Ruthine continued:
"The captain begged me to renew. his
assurance that this matter shall be hel.l
In the strictest confidence by onrselvt:*
and the quartermasterâ who alone know
of Itâ and that you will be set at fiberty
on giving your word of honor not to maki-,
any further attempt on your life." tr â¢
Ruthlne was-;agaln met by stubborn
silence, and presently withdrew. -'Â¦
In his own cabin ho found a woman
waiting to see himâ a middle-aged person^
to be described by the word respectable â ".
who had the subdued manner of a hisb
class lady's maid.
"I wish to ..ask your advice, sir," she
said. .â¢ . . . -
"Professional?"
"No, sir." , .
"Then I would suggest your going to the
captain. I am not a person in authority,'
you understand." Â¦ Â¦ * , ',
Which was trueâ up to a certain point
"It's only something I wish taken cara' f
of.," said the woman, with downcast' eyes.
VWell, the captain has a large safe in
his cabin'. I have onlv a small one here
and It is full. ' Come with me. please."
And the ex-lady's maid found hers^rf
morally hustle! into the captain's cabi-i
where that gray-haired mariner was mak
ing-entries in a private log book. ,<?Â¦:
"Good morning:" said the captain, in
his pleasant, brisk way. " "What can J do
for you?" - - .-.Â¦>! .
"If you please, .sir." said. the woman
with a hesitation she tried to conceal "I
have a packet 1' should like you to take
care of.". . ,.-Â¦'â¢. , ... ... .,,...
"Jewelry or valuables, I suppose?"/ '
And Mark Ruthlne" closed the door" with
his foot. Â¦ â . Â¦ - - - . Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦- â¢ -
"Yesâ sir." * ,
S "Which'" *
"My cabin," said Ruthlne. as the quar
termaster staggered up the steps with his
wet burden.
"The captain," he added, curtlyi when
the man had deposited his charge on the
doctor's sofa. The quartermaster went
away with his staring lamp and left' them
aloneâ in the dark for a moment, until
Ruthine found the electric light. Then he
turned, and saw for the first time whose
life he had saved. It was a Mrs. Mall
wanerâa slight, pretty woman, with hard
eyes and a mouth that was much too.
'email: Her appearance was, of course,
known to Ruthine., -. '. .,
"You â¢ did that on purpose/? â¢ he : said,
opening the door of the wine -locker.
"Yes," she answered, in avolcer full of
resentment.' She. was putting- back her
hair, which was pretty, even when wet.
"it isa warm night," said Mark Ruth
lne, whose; suddenly , aroused ,, interest
prompted him to assume as complete a â¢
composure as her own. '.'You will not hurt

"Yes." â¢ . Â¦â¢ Â¦ :Â¦'Â¦Â¦: Â¦> ' â¢.Â¦:Â¦; Â¦ -7 ;
He was adding something from his med

"Better drink.that," he said. "You don't

. "Nd," snapped, the lady. ; r^- ;;
She drank/ the. mixture with a stoical 1

"TÂ« It necessary to give particulars,
sir?" â¢ â¢ Â¦
"Most certainly." answered the captain,
".so that I may give you a receipt."
' The captain took a book from his writ-
Ing table drawer and waited. Very slow
ly the woman laid. a.. small parcel on tha '
table.
"I must ask you to show mo the con
tents," said the caotain with sudden
sharpness. The woman, glanced slantwaya
at Ruthlnf? and found him In contempla
tion of his own boots.

"Most assuredly stolen." said the cap
tain in the Telegu tongue, and RuthinÂ»

"You know." said the captain pleasant
ly, as he made out tho receipt, "you ought
to have given thesÂ» Into tho purser's cara
when you first came on board. That is
the usual way of doing It."
"Yes. sir."
"Why did you not do so?" Inquired he.

"I did not think there would be any dan

"Not at first?"
"No. sir."
. "But you do now?"
."Erâ yes. sir."
"Why?" asked the- captain looklnr up
sharply, and the woman, was surprised
Into givlne an answer.
"Because' some onÂ© tried to tax* them
last night." â¢
"Are you sure of that?" inerulred th*
captain, looking straight at her.
"Yes. sir." answered the woman em
phatically. "For I had a hard struggle to
keep possession of them."
"Then you saw the thief?"
"Noâ sir. But I heard and felt her In
the dark. -However. I sot my property
back, and thero Is an end qf It."
The captain was looking at her keenly.
"Do you want It to end there?"
"If you please, sir." replied the woman.
with an. aplomb that proved, her meek
ness to be only a badge of office. "It win
do the ship no ..good to have a scandal,
and I do not csre so long aa I have my
property/' â¢ -
The woman scored her points with a
quiet self-possession. ---
"You could not Identify the thief?" in
quired the captain, indifferently.
"Oh, no, sir." -- â* Â¦'
"She is lylns." put In Ruthine, In Te
legu. and the captain nodded.
The person who looked like a lady's
maid presently returned to her quarters,
leaving the two men together.
"So far as I could see she only lied once,
and that was when she said she did not
know the thief," said Ruthlne, when the
door was closed. >
"Yes." answered the other; "the dia
monds are hers right enough, and It la
fortunately not our business ,to ask how
she came by them." * r - .
In the afternoon Ruthine visited Mrs.
Mallwaner. and found her m a frame of
mind which would In the second-class sa
loon have been called snappy. He told
nor some stories of persons who- had the
same complaint as her little girl and had
satisfactorily recovered therefrom.
"By the way. Mrs. Mallwaner. the cap
tain "has transferred you to the flrwt -class
Il3t," he added, rising to goâ Indeed he
stood by the door with hi$ shoulder turned
toward her until he had completed hla
observations. "Rather an unpleasant in
cident has occurred In. the second-class
paloon which is only known to the cap
tain and myself, and which I tell you. in
the strictest confidence. There was an at
tempted robbery last night, but . . .
the victim of the attempt can give bo
clew whatever to tho thief, and there will
be no Inquiry." . . . . , 'â¢â
Then he went out and closed ths door
softly behind him. He had caught sight
again of the crest engraved on the tlttlngs
of Mrs. Mallwaner's dressing case, and
with the device fresh In his memory ha
went to his own cabin to consult De
brett. Mrs. Mallwaner had . spoken no
more than the truth when she talked of,
being connected with the best people In
"''The captain and Dr. Mark Ruthlne sat
long over their pipes that night, and if
they set aside the law. they remembered
the word" that urges us to forgive our
neighbor his trespass. . -
Ruthlne visited Mrs. Mallwaner the next
m v\Ve n reach Brindisl to-night," he said,
in answer to her inquiry, and her change
of demeanor waa not loÂ§t upon him.
There was a sort of suppressed happl
ress about Mrs. Mallwaner this morning.
"Iihave been immensely relieved,"" she
said v "bv what you* tell me .of Cicely's
Illness. -"I . . â¢ I think I could Rive
that promise now, if you and the -captain
will trust me." ti .,, ; ..
Ruthlne looked thoughtfully at Mrs.
Mallwaner's hands, which were twisted
nervously together on her lap. 'Â¦ ,
"I have been working myself up Into a
terror." she went on. "ever since I got
my sister's letter. You are not. married.
Dr. Ruthlne?"
"No." answered Mark Ruthlne.
Â¦'. "Then yo r u do not understand feelings
about . ' . '.-Â¦ children?"
"One may understand In part," said the
doctor, quietly. ....
"I was o.ulte hopeless about her." went
on the little lady, with a look in her hard
eyes -which 1 the doctor knew, for the ma
ternal instinct crops up in strange places.
"We cannot . afford to pay the best sur
geons. It is always hard to be poorâ
sometimes it is horrible."
.-."Yes," said Ruthine, and there j was
something in his voice that startled away
the conventional and somewhat self-com
placent expression of her .face. There
followed a silence which Ruthlne at length
broke.
"I came to tell you." he said, "that the
captain has arranged to exchange your
â¢ passage for an overland route ticket from
, Brindisl if that is agreeable to you. You
will thus be with your child eight days
'â¢Â¦ earlier." ... â¢ ' \ '^ ' ;
Mrs. Mallwaner looked up with , the
startled air again. Her face was.,.sud
' den'y â¢ colorless. 'â¢â¢-Â¦-

ship to-night," added Ruthine in a final
voice. ' *

Mrs Mallwaner's pretty face was hid

ON THE BRINKsimple, but the theory and practice must
go hand in hand. For this reason it Is
better to stfay by one brand of plates and
one good formula for the developer until
their capabilities are thoroughly under
stood. There are developers from A to Z
and dry plates of many different makes,
and every developer and plate has its own
peculiarities. Experimenting tends to con
fuse. ra.ther than to establish the definite
rules so npcessarv to the beginner. For,
as I said Â¦ before, the mechanical steps,
the routine of details in photography
should become fixed habits. For when
the mind is free to look Â«t the work from
the artistic point and not be bothered by
the details, the best results naturally fol
low. Here Is a good formula for a devel
oper. I recommend the following as be
ing the best for all around, work:
Water, soft or distiller! 32 ounces
Metol ....Â¦ 15 grains
Hydroqulnlne â¢ .' â¬0 gralru
Sulphite sodium ftrle-1. powdered).. 1 ounce
Carbonate sodium < dried, powdered).. % ounce
Potassium bromide ....... .^.... 4 grains
' Dissolve in the order named and remember
that while this amount of bromide ia usually
rapher la not always above suspicion, aÂ»
a Sheriff of a northern town could testify.
He and his posse spentMhe better part
of an hour working their way from cliflT
to cliff up the steep mountain In the hot
sun, only to- find an Innocent photogra
pher prowling in search of a suitable
standpoint, and not the escaped convict
they were looking for. He explained that
although he had often been called crazy,
he had never before been taken for a con
vict, and that he could not conscientious
ly claim the right to the free board and
lodging furnished by the State.
Sometimes the photographer has to wait
days for the right climatic conditions.
The stories of peril told by the moun
tain photographer vie in danger with the
pioneer miners. He tells of the enormous
rattler that buzzed at his heel and of the
grizzly bear that walked up to hla cam
era, took a look and walked away. But
of these stosles we have no evidence save
his unsupported word.

Three of the Presidents of the United
States died- on the anniversary of the sign-
Ing of the Declaration or .Independence.

IT is most important that the beginner
in photography follow a certain rout
ine with his camera, until the routine
ha.* become a matter of habit. One de
tail of the routine emitted, failure Is the
result. I find that most of the failurts
come from inisundorstandin? the impor
tance of the details.
In the elmple cartridge camera the ama
teur should lirst of ail acquire the habit
of winding off the Jpizc immediately after
exposure.
In the larger cameras he. must learn
quickly to focus, insert the proper stoo,
cap the lens, place tilt? plateholder. draw
the slide, expose his plate and replace
the Elidr, reversed side out. He must da
these things at times under the most ex
dtine conditions, and only force of babit
will insure success. '} \[~: -

In landscape photography the. success or
failure of a picture depends largely on the
foreground. The choice of -a' stand point :
bhould be made only after carefully exain-"
Ining the selected scene 'from every pofnr,
of view. The best nlace for the camera
may be ud In a tree or on the- face of'a ;
cliff, or perhaps knee-deep In water, but
the enthusiast does not mind these draw
backs.
In takinpr this pictuie of the 1 source of,

the camera on two rocks In the. middle of
the stream^ The olcture of Moss Brae
Falls was taken from a tiny island in the
middle of the rapids.
The camera fixed, then comes the most
trj^ng partâ the. waiting. The Photograph
er must wait on nature. He must "wait
for the_ right cloud effect: the fog to life
from the mountain top: the sun to break
through that cloud. Then, he must select
and instantly take the best" of the, many
. expressions that are constantly passing
over the facÂ» of nature. This aptitude,
like everything else, comes with practice.

his art. Actual experience will teach him
that the photograph of his friend,who'as
pumed an easy and comfortable pose, may
develop in tho finished, picture* to be a
monstrosity, with the feet of a giant and
the head of a baby; the vista of trees,
with its.sunshine and shadow and delicate
coloring, is represented in the; . finished
picture like soot and whitewash. Â¦ Each

The handiest kind of a lens Is one in
which the front and back series of the
combination can.be used separately. Then

In exposjng the plate it is better to err

THE STRENUOUS WOMAN.
By Mrs. Martha Jaft ZOeniworlh.

:|i obtrusive' as we. Rrfl ,her? . Coulfl .
our ancestors have overlooked her. had
she been as noisily energetic as the.pres-
ent.century woman? The rricn. of those
times were .rather determined, you know %
If strenuous women coulct sec them
selves with the eyes of their beholders. I
fancy there would be ihang* forHhe bel
ter. No Woman really cares to bethought
a nuibancc,: however 1 she may snap herj
fir.Rers at public opinion. The .story is
told of a famous wateriÂ»iB -pifice which
abounded with hnnd&ome. healthy and en
trsetlc young. women, but war, meagrely
â¢ Â¦ 6uppliefl- with men. '-As misht be ox-

Â¦^ Â¦' ' up -nights to devise schemes for
I^JSkk- aroiisiiiK Interest in tlif minds'

K\ ' forced into' activ
j^Hffiik ity through the
j^E energy of girls who seemed 10
live In an atmosphjre of short
OW ' skirts, thick Ehoes and plainly
BjMr drepsod hair.
vK/t/ " One day the place was rousÂ»l
fMf to ft mild sort of excitement by
W/_ the arrival of guosts whom nobody
' knew. Mother and daughter they
were, -and a maid was. their only ct
tendant... Women were numerous enough
to make fresh arrivals a matter of. no
moment, even though '..they were gootl
looking- But somehow .these^soemed to
lie a different, species of womanhood
which promised to be worth studying.
Â¦ That night mother and daughter made
their first public appearance. The former
was a sweet "faced woman, whose hair
was just beginning to whiten;- the latter
was a "dainty bit of femininity with "soft.
' (Copyright. 1901. by Walter B. Ouild.> Â«
faintly rustling draperies and an air that
was positively refreshing after the weeks
of athletic companionship. Kvery man in
the, room -felt the. restful influence with
out being- able to define it, and from that
moment the doom of the energetic girls,
was assured. Within three days the new
\cwner Jiadall the men at her pretty feet,
and a.^var council was in session. :
j She-was a Southern girl ' who had -not"
â¢acquired the athletic craze. She had. been
brought up to distinctly feminine way*.
.warf cracfous and "weli bred, and made
no ; pretensions to -clevernetss. She. had a
woman's fondness for pretty attire, and
openly, confessed .that* she knew nothing
of fiolf;' "tennis,, wheeling and the other
amusements to which that- particular set
/of eirls was addicted. She did not care
'to learn, she avowed, but was willing to
be . present" at any. or all games, merely
as an onfooker..That was the character
every man elected: to. play after sne ex
pressed her sentiments" in the low pitched,
rather, lazy -voice -which was chief among
her, attractions, but' which she used. In a
sparing .manner.' It never became monot
onous," sis.you. may. readily see. -. -V.Iy *"
One 'weelcv of 'that sort.' of (thing ' was
enough" for Â»the girls. There was a gen
eral overhauling of. trunks and boxes, and
Â¦ mysterious letters 'which Â¦ broughf 1 equally
mysterious packages. ; Short skirts an<L
. thick were } replaced by feminino
fripperie's.- and* the girl from the. South
was responsible; for the change. The plan
jworked like a charm.' Delinquent knights
returned jto their allegiance, all but one,
.the. most desirable one of_ the'lot, who'
ejected to _ bestow a llfe-lf>ng allegiance
upon the pretty 'Southerner. â ' '
I understood that story perfectly, be
cause not long 'before" I heard a man ex
press his o'plnioh of women in a compari
son ho drew between his fellow boarders
of the opposite sex .and a new acquisition
to the household. -The new.womanwas
pretty, but that mattered little to him
and the other men.- She. was different,
which was more to the point. She wore
Â¦ poft gowns of delicate texture, pretty
shoos, elaborate hats and the many other
little things .whlcb he -noted, but could
not describe. "She has never worn,tho3e
ucly. stiff collars," he explained, "but al
ways some soft and .frilly thing that is
awfully becoming. Her handkerchiefs an*
small and dainty, quite unlike the hem
stitched nosewipers. you women carry
with tailor-made frocks." I knew 'the
kind of woman he meant: I had seen her
and felt the charm of her, femininity^ I
had also noted- the attendance men gave
her at' every Â¦'turn 1 . Â¦- She was, however, ii
girl the strenuous woman would have
turned her nose up over because she never
hurried or appeared to do much of any-
thing else but give pleasure by merely ex
isting.
The : strenuous woman has made us
keenly alive. to such a presence. She hus
tles about from one thing to another,
never weary, never auiet. and never al
lowing others, to *e quiet, even when they
are weary. She begins the week by com
pelling the family to leave bed for break
fast at an unusual hour because It 13
washday and bargain day. She rushes thÂ«Â»
children through the dressing process and
sends 'them to school with their llttla
nerves tingling with* the unrest * whlcix
their mother's active ways have imparted.
The male members of the family begin
their business day without the repose oJ
mind ami clearness of intellect they need,
and nobody Js comfortable, not even th(j
strenuous woman. She has met obstaclrs
which she brushed aside with an energy
whose effects she felt later on. ; ;;
The next day offers a^ little variety. It
Is Ironing day and elub.-day, perhaps, and
everything el3e must Â¦ Rive way. Then,
comes mending day. and so on through
the week, each task calling for an unduo
display of energy. After a season of this
we, hear that our neighbor is a .victim
of nervous prostration or some' ailment
equally crave. She recovers, of course.
and learns nothing by the, experience. So
much for the strenuous woman.
But If she dirt not exist,, who would
Ferve on committees? Who would keep
alive the cluba organized for every pur
pose under the sun but that, of economy
of nerve force? They simply could not
exist. Would we be better or worse oft
than we now aro? I am not prepared to
say. ..Perhaps wp miKht not appreciate
the reposeful woman did we not have the
advantage of comparison. Yet I must
confess to a wish to avoid the- strenuous
vcrnan. even though I am forced blocks
out of my way In f sea ping her. I do not
always escape, because she belongs to .a
largo and growing class: but then I en
deavor to make the meeting a short one.
,Th<? worst feature cf such a woman in
the effect she leaves up^n others. If she
wore out her own body" and brain and thÂ«Â»
mischief ended rignt there. shÂ» might re
ceive more toleration. But she is a pr>?i
â¢tlve affliction to sensitive organizations.
Matter of fact persons are able, to shake
off Impressions as ducks do water drops,
but they form such a small' part of hu
manity. Â» . â¢
. It may be that some brilliant mind will
formulate a scheme to separate people
into classes, not by birth or possessions,
or even by mental endowments, but dv
mental conditions. If the class line could
then be drawn with the clearness of casta
distinctions In the Orient we might hope
to escape. Xo other plan seems to prom
ise anything worth mentioning.

Ufhne!s that have been cut throuah the
Alps, and could be ccr.strurted Quito as
easily. The cost for eafh running yard. hÂ»

that such a tunnel nould prove of im

Predominance of Germans.
The political phases are being discussed.
The remarkable predominance of Ger
mans and German Influence is. note
worthy. Empcrcr William's officers, sol
diers and sailors wcr^ more conspicuous
In all the ceremonies than were those of
Â«U the other nations together. This has
had" the effect of popularizing Germany
Â¦with the people, who recently regarded
her as their mcst menacing enemy. It ia
evident that Enjlishniea realize that King
Ijdward's reign begins confronted by a
commercial crisis and political dangers
â¢vrbieh give a shadow of anxiety to their
mourning for the Qurcn.
To-night the Queen's body lies In" the
Albert Chapel sÂ».t Windsor, guarded faith
fully, awaltini; the last rites. Within, the
case lies brilliantly lighted.
King K Sward and Queen Alexandra,
Emperor William, the Princes and their
cultes dined magnificently this evening.
Three Klr.trs ard heads of principalities,
â¢with special representatives, left -.Windsor
this afternoon after lunching at the cas
tle. Their departure was somewhat In
terfered with by the enormous proportions
of the crowds gathered around the Wind
tcr station, ani In many cases the royal
Ijfrsonages were literally bundled into the
cpecial trains awaiting them. It was at
Windsor that the only hitches in the elab
orate programme of the day occurred, and
Foreign Potentates Departing.
To-night "the captains and the Kings
depart." The imperial yacht Hohenzollern
awaits Emperor William at Port Victoria.
Zi'.r.s Leopold and Kins Carlos have re
turned to London, preparing for their re
turn home, and Prince Ferdinand depart
ed on an evening train, traveling lncog
nito.
This city to-nlsht jas somewhat of a
holiday air, thousands of persons parad
ing the streets, viewing the decorations
end restaurants and salocns are doing a
tremendous business. The uniforms of
the militia and colociai troops are visible
everywhere, and their wearers are lion
ized.
The hospitals cared for 1205 persons who
â¢were Injured in the crowd. Of this num
ber, however, sixty were hurt only, in
cluding policemen, soldiers and a number
cf people suffering from broken limbs.
All Business Is Suspended.
All business ceased, even the drinking
houses closed their doors during the day.
The newspapers suspended publication
and life in London, like the rest of the
empire, turned from its customary chan
nels and -vras focuBed upon three miles of
"West End Btreets, upon the coffin con
taining the body which was now merely a
symbol of Victoria's self, who often'be
fore Londoners had cheered. -assembled as
they were to-duy, but on occasions of re
joicing.
To the American the ceremonials, with
uZl the theatrical trappings of royalty
\rcre not more expressive than the funeral
of a chief magistrate chosen by the
people. .
The Kings and Princes, beneath silver
helmets and wearing gold braided coats,
were men. but the sight seen of the King
Tiding utter the coifin of his mother euvl
Queen, with four Kln^s and half a hun
dred of il.e highest rovalties of European
dynasties foll<rw-iri5 and the hereditary
Quaint attaches of court, 'was one never
to be forgotten.
The popular mourning was less general
end ostentatious than it would have been
In the United States. The multitudes were
xeTT.a.rkable. The wnjle ceremonial, ln
ciudlng the massing of 3u 000 troops and
the er.trrttlnment of all the visitlcff per
sonages. was an admirable example of
organization.
TONDON, Feb. 2.â "It has
been a great reign," epokc
Mr. Balfour in his eulogy
before the House of Com
mons, "and it has a happy
ending." All London and
t'-f\ mtti^g thousands from the remot- ;
est villages of the kingdom '
paid their final homage to |
the Queen to-day in her capital, and as- ,
Eured!y, as Mr. Balfour said, the end of
her reign, which is now passed Into his
tory, was hajipy. Deep solemnity filled all
hearts. There was reminiscent grief â thÂ« '
feeling that one cf the empire's great In
stitutions was massing â but no such sor
rotr as surrounded the cofflns of Lincoln
and GarSeld, cut off before their work
wes dene. Every one felt that the Inevit
able death had dtaJt kindly with their
sovereign; that her passing had been as
harpy as her life was useful. They gath
ered to hor.or her memory rather than to
mom her loss.
The Klr.ir and Queen. In a special au
dience granted Embassador Choate and
Secretary cf Embassy White, after the
conclusion of the services at "Windsor, ex
pressed themselves as profoundly touched
by the manifestations of sympathy In
America. In .the course of conversation!*
had by Mr. "White trlth other members of
the royal family all gave expression to
fcimllar sentiments.
As a Queen, Victoria was an exemplar
of the solid Tirtues and the aspirations
an*l lives cf the middle class of English
men and they fittingly seemed the moat
sincere mourners.

Queen. Thousands of men
and women, dark-robed, silent, sympa
thetic, contributed their presence and
their feeling to the splendid ceremonial
which found its expression in the great
structure on Larkin street.
Men and women of. all classes and
creeds, representatives of every phase of
honorable life in San Francisco, dignita
ries of church, state and commerce, as
sembled there In silent tribute to the
Queen who was dead. Long before the
services were to begin a great crowd gath
ered at the several entrances to the build
ing. Thousands stood .patiently, silently,
reverently at the doors waiting for the
signal which was to admit them to tho
most unique sanctuary which thÂ» people
of the city ever constructed.
Above them floated the Stars and Stripes
at half-mast. Within the great building
all was silence and almost darkness. Tho
great barnllke building was a mortuary
chapel. The arches were lost in black
shadows. The galleries were draped in
broad panels of black and white. Wreaths
of dead gTeen, touched with purple, lent
the -aignlficance of death to the decora
. tlons. At the very end of the pavilion a
platform . was raised. Purple-hued, fern
adorned.- ribbon-decorated, it seemed like
a mammoth altar erected for a service of
utmost solemnity. Behind it were draped
the Sags of America, and" England, the
crimson of the Stars and Stripes blending
In brilliant color with the scarlet of the
Union .'Jack. Above the altar was the
crown, black and white ana purple In ltÂ»
hues of death and royalty.
When the doors were thrown open there
was not a sound in me great pavilion. The
throngs of men and women streamed into
the edifice. Scores of police were there,
but they were not needed. More than
14.000 people passed into Mechanics' Pa
vilion as if they were going to their de
votions in a church. Before the hour fixed
for the opening of the services the mam
moth bulldine was crowded to the very
doors. Every seat upon the main floor
was taken, and faces were framed In the
galleries until their outlines were loÂ»t In
the shadows of the arches. The vast ma
jority had robed themselves In keeping
with the occasion. They were In black.
The Solemnity of Death.
At 2:30 o'clock the vast congregation,
the largest that was ever assembled In
one building in this city, heard tho shrill.
'walling, moaning notes of the bagpipes.
The deep-toned, weirdly sounding bell In
the rafters began to toll and from, a bid
den station came the muffled sounds of
drums. The scene nael In it an inspiration
of awe. It possessed the solemn 'dignity
of death.
The vast congregation, men. women and
children, arose. The muffled roll of
tho drums was In their ears; â¢ the
sound of the telling bell waa like a heart
beat. The shrill notes of the bagpipes
grew louder and louder and the procession
of invited dignitaries passed Into view oP
the great congregation. Up the steps to
the purple altar they passed, clergymen
In the black and white and crimson robes
of mourning, officers of the army and
navy In their trappings of gold and black,
members of the consular, corps in their
gay trappings of gold and silver lace and
decorations, civilian!) high in the opinion
of the people of tho State, officials of the
city and State, black robed and sedate.
Slowly and solemnly the procession
moved to the platform. A hush was upon
the vast congregation and then was en
acted one of the most striking scenes ever
witnessed in San Francisco. The shrill.
mourning- wail of th*e bagpipes was
silenced. ; The orchestra began the dread
music of a dirge. At regular Intervals
was the weird tolling of the funeral bell.
Every person In the building was stand
ing; thousands of men. women and chil
dren were on their feet in silent anticipa
tion of what was to come. *
Raising the Standard to the Sing.
And then there was a movement on tho
purple-draped platfoim. Two little girls.
one. robed In the colors of the American
flag, the other in the garb of a Scotch
lassie.* stepped forward and from two
standards two flags slowly rose, one the
Union Ja"ck. the other the Stars and
Stripes. Inch by Inch these flags -were
hoisted on their standards until they were
at half mast. The dead march was thrill
ing the senses of the congregation; the
belr was tolling its gloomy message and
then again came silence. The splendid
service of death had begun-
It was not a Ions: one. The cherished
hymns of Christians were sung and thÂ«
thousands of voices united In a tremen
dous volume of melodious sound. Tha
strange, beautiful service of death of th<*
Episcopal Church was chanted and from
every part of the pavilion came the deep
toned mumrnur of responses. In solemn
prayer priests prayed for the dead Queen
and the living King, and then throughout
the vast building moaned the last deal

Seamen Substituted for Horses.
The first and most striking was the in
tractability of the horses attached to the
gun carriage bearing the coffin. The alarm
and chagrin of the King and Emperor;
who had hurried up to ascertain the cause
of delay in the procession leaving Wind
sor station, was patent upon their coun
tenances. The horses struggled in .the
traces and the coffin was almost thrown
from the gun carriage. Lord Roberts
asked the King for permission to take out
the horses and Bubstltuts â¢ for them thÂ«

muddy streets since daylight that the
funeral procession Â¦with the body, of Queen
Victoria. had begun its passage through
the capital. '
' The people fought for. hours for a
glimpse of the coffin, and the Kings and
others following It. The*" saw a long pro
cession of soldiers, a passing show of daz
zling regalia, with a hundred royalties
crowding after, and then dispersed, while
all the church chimes of the city weie
ringing and muffled dirges were played.
Europe has seen grander royal funerals
than the Queen's, and had a more gor
geous spectacle in the celebration of her
sixty years of- reign, but no episode in
the Victorian era will live so deeply im
pressed on the memories of those who
witnessed it or participated in the cere
monies.
The day was somber/" wet and chilly,
as are most of London's winter days. The
cloudy' sky- added to the gloom of the
whole city.
The scene at Victoria station from early
morning was most brilliant and impres
sive. For to-day'a ceremony the station
was transformed Into an Immense recep
tion hall, j All trains were stopped before
9 o'clock, and the long platforms were
covered with purple Â¦ cloth. On another
platform, facing that at which the
Queen's train was to arrive, guards of
honor, composed of bluejackets and Gren
adier Guards', were drawn up. " The broad
roadway 8eparating s the two was swept
clean and sanded, and a number of little
purple-covered: . platforms, from which
members of the royal party were'expect
ed to mount their horses, were placed at
intervals at the side and center. Â¦ *
Â¦ At 10 o'clock an ' army of grooms with
horses arrived, and thenceforward
naval officials and foreign royalties. In
dazzling uniforms, came "in quick suc
cession. "The Lord Chamberlain and his
officials, bareheaded, with their white

them, to a. little pavilion erected on the
platform. .

BERLIN', Feb. 2. â Excepting a few Lib
eral papers like the Vossische Zeituns and
the Tagehlatt. the German press' has in
no way received the advances of ihe Brit^
l*h press this week srradously. Nine
tenths of the press persist in pretending
that the German Emperor's visit was a
mere raatier cf filial piety and thit the
honors mutually conferred there were
solely meaning-less civilities. In no way
touching or indicating the sentiment of
the two nations toward each other, nor
reconciling their conflicting interests.
While for a coujjle of days after the
Queen'* death the Anglorhobe press kept
a truce, during the last half of the week
the press began to speak openly on the
subject of Anglo-German relations && ex
isting upon Jvj.-.t; Edward's accession. The
Xreiiz Zeitung to-day ridiculed the Lon
don Daily Telegraph's proposal for a
"moral entente" between Germany and
Â£&giand, adainÂ£:
"If the anti-KUropean economic attitude
of the I'nited States continues serious dif
ferences will ensue in which England
likely, perforce, will join against the
T_'nited States, which threatens to be a
znucfa more formidable opponent than
Germany. But Germany's economic in
terests would nevertheless remain antag
onistic to Kngland, and Germany in no
catse would join in lighting the United
f3ta.tes nor Â¦would. Knjrland expect- that,
fearing thereby possibly to strengthen
<Â»ermany, her rival. Germany in such a
case would be tertlus gaudens."
The Rhenish Westphaelische Zeltung
prints e. similar article. Tho Xeuesta
J^achricnten to-day prints an editorial
rather friendly toward England, but
points out the difficulties to an en
tente between the two countries and de
mands tli^-t Ensrland must once and for
ell drop her superciliousness and recog
jiize Germany as uer full equal. Oniy
thus could aa understanding be at all
maintained.
Â¦The Lelpsio ICeueste Nachrichten and
the Hamburg Xaehrichten. print articles
6everely blaming the Emperor for his pro
longed visit to Kngland. the latter eaylng:
"In that the Emperor's English sym
pathies collide with ins duties <ls German
Emperor."
The Cologoa Zeltung claims that it is
the old fight between the pro-Russian and
pro-Kritish parties in Germany, while the
correct thing would be to preserve good
relations toward both. The semiofficial
press during the week has been, rigidly
tilcnt and is awaiting the Emperor's re
turn intimation, livery Gtrman paper
that has in any way referred to the
Anglo-German relations has scouted the
id*=-a of an Angrlo-Gerraan alliance.
Several ministerial utterances have
caused much press comment this week.
Count von Bulow'e declaration in tb>Â»
Diet, that included eoclal protective duties
to eld German agriculture are certain to
cause a general onslaught upon Count
von Bulow by the Liberal press, which
claims that he has become an Agrarian

mercial tactics. Then there were Com
rnercLal Minister Buford's remarks call
ing the coal dealers a necessary, evil, and
Minister of Justice Schoenstedfs state
ment that the Jewish candidates for Gov

exceptionally. The remarks have stirred
up the whole Liberal press, which points

DEWEY TAKES -PRECEDENCE
OVER GENERAL MILES
Final Settlement of the Question of
Relative Rank of the Two
Officers.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â All doubt as to
the precedence of Admiral Dewey over
Lieutenant General Miles was removed at
the memorial services for England's Queen
to-day. Admiral Dewey. accompanied by
members of his staff, all in special full
dress uniform, were seated by the ushers
in a pew immediately back of the mem
bers of the Supreme Court. Lieutenant
General Miles and Adjutant General Cor
bln. with an escort of officers, were seat
ed in the next pew back. Â¦ ,
All the officers wore special full dress
uniforms, and conspicuous at their sword
hlltswere knots of somber crepe. As they
left the church General Miles paused and
waited for Admiral Dewcy to precede him.
This is regarded as a final settlement of
the question of precedence, indicating that
when officers of the army and navy par

other occasions Admiral Dewey, because
of- his â¢ superior rank, takes precedence
over General Miles.

men to-day. The conclusion reached by
all was that, while It would not be safe
to assume that Justice Harlan was voic
ing the views of the majority of the
Court or forecasting the court's decision,
he was undoubtedly expressing his own
views. Whatever the decision of the ma
jority of the court may be. there is.
therefore, no doubt among public men
here that Justice Harlan believes Con

the present Porto Rican tariff law and,
that Porto Rico and all other Insular pos-

/CATARRH spares neither strong nor
V^ weak, old or young, sick or well.
All ranks of people have chronic
catarrh; rich men, poor men, beggar men,
thieves, lawyers, ' doctors, merchants,
priests. Xot only catarrh of the head,
but catarrh of the throat, catarrh of the
lungs, catarrh of the> stomach, catarrh of
the liver, catarrh of the kidneys, catarrh
of the bowels and a multitude of women
are afflicted with catarrh of the pelvic
ore-ans.
Catarrh Is a word which Includes a mul-
titude of diseases. Nearly one-half of tho
diseases to which the human flesh is
liable are, in ; reality, nothing: more nor
less than catarrh in some phase or loca-
tion. . V '
When It Is said, therefore, that Peruna
cures catarrh wherever located, a much
larger fact is stated than at first appears.
If It be true that Peruna really does euro
catarrh wherever located 1 , what a multi-
tude of diseases Peruna will cure.
Who is it- that says Peruna- will cure
catarrh wherever located? Doctors say
It, lawyers say Jt. preachers say It,' a
vast army of men and women say it who
have tried It The old and the young say
it. They say it in- the East, in the West;
they say it.in'the North and in the-South.
, All these say that .Peruna â¢ will cure ca-
tarrh wherever , located, and they say it
too without any solicitation, hesitation
or remuneration.- Never was a greater
assertion crowded into fewer word?, Pe-
runa cures catarrh wherever located.
Catarrh Patients Lately Cured by Dr.
Hartman. *
Thousands of people who know of Pe-
runa as a catarrh cure get It and begin
treatment. Some of these people write
to Dr. Hartman. Hundreds of letters are
received by the doctor every day. These
letters are all promptly answered free.
The cures- are numerous. These testi-
monials are not solicited and never pub-
lished except by the wish of the ones writ-

A. B>emedy for the Cure of Piles
Which Has Met With Be-
markable Success.
There are many popular medicines that
are known In every household in America,
There are blood purifiers, nerve tonics.'
headache powders, dyspepsia cures and
cough cures, which are sold in " every
drugstore. â¢
But all of these must divide popularity
with many rivals; no one remedy has the
field to itself with the single exception of
pile cures, for it Is a singular fact that
among the host of remedies there Is but
one pile cure that can be considered as
having a national reputation, without a
rival, and the remedy referred to is the
Pyramid Pile Cure, which for. seven years
has steadily worked Into public, favor by
reason of its extraordinary merit and a
method and a record of remarkable cures,,
until it is known from Maine ro Califor-
nia and from Manitoba to the Gulf ol
Mexico. .- ;
It Is true there are. many pile remedies
having a small local reputation for a year
or 'two, but the Pyramid Pile Cure has
rapidly supplanted them all, -and really
has the field to itself, when anything like
national popularity is considered. -.->:-Â«.
The explanation Is simple. It Is be-
cause piles is In no sense an imaginary
trouble, that a simple salve or ointment
wllV cure, but an obstinate, painful .and
often dangerous trouble, and a remedy to
give satisfactlfjn must "possess, positive
and very apparent merit. A person suffer-
ing from piles will not experiment -for
months with a remedy; It must give relief
and a euro in short order or it is con-
demned; . . . .-'. 'Â¦'Â¦
The worst cases of piles are relieved on
the first -application. . and : - being â¢ in sup-
pository form .; is convenient . to. use and
cures without interfering with dally occu-
pation. " â¢ , % :
Â¦ Medical men use It in>preference to sur-
gical operations, because it is so safe and
painless, and the cost, compared to bene-
fit given, is a mere trifle, as all druggists
sell it at 50 cents. - â¢ â¢
If suffering, from any form . of -..pIlcV

tho Pyramid Pile Cure will cure you and

Immediately after the company about

Th^T marched slowly and without music.
Most of the uniform; 5 were covered with
dark overcoats, and the standards were
draped with black, the officer? wearing

Then the bearer party advanced to tho
R&ioon carriage, and with his hand at
RaJute and et-andine a little in advance
at the others. King Kdward watched the
painfully slow removal of the coffin to
the gun carriage. It was finally accom
plished and the pall and the regalia, of
the Xiritlsii crown were placed on the
coffin.
All heads were uncovered as the sa
loon carnage bearing the Queen's remains
stopped exactly opposite thÂ» gun carriage
and King Edward. Queen Alexandra^ Em

AA lth the exception that rubber tires
â¢were on. the wheels, the gun carriage was

fin to rest was over the grun.
It was then nearly 11 o'clock wtien cries
were heard of "The King of Portugal's

It wap the little khaki-colored gun car
riage whlrh was to carry Queen Victoria's
remains from Victoria to l'addlngton Sta
tion. The clpht Hanoverian cream-col

Queen on the occasion of the Jubilee, were
used to-day. The gold harnessed, scarlet

guished British officers. Then came the
carriages for the Quern and the Prin
cesses. They were the Ftate carriages
used on the occasion of the Queen's Jubi

apparently at the gun carriage, on which

women, the multitude of uncovered
heads, the purple draperies and the green
wreaths everywhere he passed like a man
ajone who looked like he cared not for
the world about him, and the sentiment
his presence Inspired was only sympathy
and pity. The people seemed to see in
the King one of themselves, and the deep
murmurs which arose : iere and there car
ried a note of sorrow and love almost a-*
deep as the expressions which greeted
the passage of the coffin of their Queen.
Beside King E<lwa.rd rode Emperor
William, his nephew and neighbor. Tin
unique, commanding figure ol the German
Emperor could not for a moment be mis
taken. He looked every inch a soldier
and the commander ef men. His Im
perial Majesty gJanoci right and left as
he rode, and his hand was frequently
raised to the red ami white feathers
hanging over his hat a? he responded to
the salutes. Emperor William aiAo wore
a black cloak over nis British Held mar
shal's uniform, and the splendid white
charger beneath him pranced up and
down, giving his Majesty an opportunity
to display fine horsemanship.
On the King's left rode his brother, the
Duke of Connaught, a man of soldierly
appearance, but almost unnoticed and un
recognized by the people.
In the second rank, behind, rode two
more sovereigns, the Kings of Greece and
Portugal, both glittering with gold lace.
There followed a dazzling array of mem
bers of royal families numbering about
forty in all, and ridir.? three abreast. So
close were they together and so quickly
did they pass that Individuals, prospective

A far from numerous military escorts,
Including a deputation from .the Queen's

but section of the procession.
Ten minutes after the coffin appeared
the funeral procession had passed and the
music of the dirges drifted back across
St James Park.
After the funeral party itself the domi
nating figure of the day was Field Mar
shal Earl * Roberts. When his popular,
weil-known ! bronzed fao? came into view
the people forgot the solemnity of the oc
casion and broke Into cheers, also shout
ing "Bobs" and other expressions of fa
miliar approval.
The military attaches of all the em
bassies and legations were with Lord
Roberts' staff. In the front ranks rode
the American attache. Major Edward B.
Cassatt. in an infantry officer's full
dress. The funeral procession occupied
two hours in passing.
From Victoria Station to Paddlngton, a
distance of three miles, the decorations
everywhere were Impressive, but not
elaborate.' Purple draperies, hung with
green wreaths. predominated. Flags
were on most of the buildings. The really
impressive exhibition of mourning was
the black clothing worn by practically all
the people, who, as the streets, windows,
stands and roofs everywhere were cov
ered with spectators, gave the whole scene
a sombre hue.
CEREMONIES
ARE HELD IN
THE CHAPEL
The grounds of Buckingham Palace were
filled with civil officials and their families.
Pensioners from Chelsea Â¦ and Greenwich
held the Sidewalks outside the palace. St.
James Park was packed with a crowd of
about 20.000 people, who overran the
flower beds, stood on the fences and
swarmed in . the tree?, sitting on the
branches and qlinging to the limbs dur
ing the long hours of waiting. It was too
much to expect the populace to maintain
a mourning demeanor and they fought
th- policemen, smashed hats and chaffed
the programme venders, after the custom
of a London holiday crowd; but when the
bejls began to ring the whole people felt
the solemnity of the day and the de
meanor of the crowds while the proces

IMPRESSIVE
TRIBUTES AT
WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â In thepresence
of a distinguished' assemblage, Including
the President of the United States and his
entire Cabinet, impressive tribute to-day
was rendered to England's dead Queen.
The ceremony occurred at St. John's Epis
copal Church, beginning at 11 o'clock this
morning, and was distinctly official in
character. The British Embassador, Lord
Pauncefote, had been directed by the Lon
don Foreign Office to bestow this last
mark of respect to the dead sovereign and
the time was chosen so as to correspond
exactly with the solemn pageant In ix>n
don.
Within the sanctuary were great masses
of flowers, with tall palms and potted
plants and purple badges or mourning. In
stead of somber black, in accordance with
the precedent established in London.
President McKinley and members of his
Cabinet arrived shortly befofe 11 o'clock
anu were escorted to seats on the ngnt of
the church, Immediately fronting the
chancel. With the President sat Secre
taries Hay, Gage and Root, while back
of them were Secretaries Long, Hitchcock
and Wilson, Attorney General Griggs and
Postmaster General Smith. Chief Jus
tice Fuller ana the Associate Justices of
the United States Supreme Court occu
pied pews Immediately back of the Presi
uential party, while to the right were
ranged Senators and members -of tho
House of Representatives, including the
presiding officer of the Senate, Mr. Frye,
and Speaker Henderson'.
The presence of- the diplomatic corps in
full uniform lent a touch of orilllancy to
the otherwise somber surroundings. Lord
Pauncefote was in ti.e full uniform ot
nis high diplomatic ottice with a black
band about hlÂ« left arm, and a knot of
crape on tne hilt of nis sword. He wua
accompanied by Lady Pauncefote, and
the Hon.' Misses Pauncefote and by
the members of the embassy staff. Each

PORTSMOUTH, Feb. 2.â Before 9 o'clock
this morning the remains' of the Queen
were taken from the royal yacht Alberta
â¢to a special carriage and conveyed to the
King's train, which started for London at
8:53 a. m. amid the boom of the guns from
the forts. The scene was pathetic and Im
posing. The King, accompanied by Queen
Alexandra and some Princesses, who
passed the night on board the royal yacht
Victoria and Albert, proceeded to the
royal yacht Alberta In a steam launch.
There -was a short service on the yacht
before the body was removed, the Duke

The Duke of Cambridge had to be helped
to a' stall, being unable to stand any
longer.
As the benediction was pronounced the
King and all present bent their heads low.
An impressive feature was the king of
arnTs' pronouncement of the titles of the
deceased. Standing before the altar, he
went through the old formula, ending up
with "God save the King," delivered so
forcefully and dramatically that his hear
ers started, sunk into a realization of the
change of regime which had so suddenly
come about.
At 4 o'clock the service was over. The
Archbishop of Canterbury bowed his head
on the altar and prayed and , the Kings
and Princes passed to the left of the altar,
leaving the coffin and passing into the
castle.
their places. Pages wearing the dress of
the George III period, with big lace rullles.
broad red coats and white breeches and
ptockings, flitted here and there, the court
attendants in black and gold were moving
about.
St. George's Chapei was a magnificent
sight and divided attention with the offi
cials and college of heralds, gorgeous in
quaint mantles, tabards and insignia, and
the Yeomen of the Guard, carrying the
halberds at slope.
At 3:30 p. m. the doors pwiinir open. "I
Am the Resurrection" was sung by the
choir. Slowly the white-robed boys made
their way up the aisle. After the Arch
bishop of Canterbury came the whlto
robes, then the coffin, and then the equer
ries, carrying the pall and regalia. Gren
adiers carried the cothn. â¢ Walking to
gether came the King. Emperor William
and the Duke of Connaught. Beside them
were the King of the Belgians, the King
of Greece and the King of Portugal, and
after them came' the royal princes, who
filled the chancel ami aisles ajid whose
suites crowded into the naive. Choate. In
evening dress, entered with the procession
and sat at the corner, near the master of
ceremonies.
The choir, having passed to the right
of the altar and the Queen and Princesses,
passed to their positions in the Queen's
gallery, overlooking the altar, the ser
vices proceeded. The strains of the organ
died away and the choir commenced sing
ing softly the sentences for the dead. The
solemn, cortege proceeded up the naive,
which was thronged with the highest and
noblest women of England. "Lord. Thou
Hast Been Our Refuce," to Felton's set
ting, was next sung by the choir,- which
had now taken its tflace in the transept
to the right of the altar. .
The coffin rested upon a catalfalqu--)
placed at the steps of tho altar. The
cross over the communion table was cov
ered with white flowers and the rod*
behind were almost concealed with sprays
of fern dotted with lilies. The Bishop of
Winchester read the lesson from the fifth
Corinthians. "Man That Is Born of
Woman" was chanted by the choir to
Wesley's music, followed by "Thou Know
est. Lord, the Secrets of Our Hearts."-
The Dean of Windsor read "I Heard a
Voice" and the choir sang the Lord'3
Prayer to the music composed especially
for the dead Queen by Gounod. Once
more the strains of the choir welled up
through the ancient rhapel with the sing
ing of "How Blessed Are They That
Die," by Tschaikowsky.
The Archbishop of Canterbury read the
Collect and with quavering voice pro
nounced , the benediction. There was a
sc'.emn pause -while all heads bowed. A
fev- sobs were -heard and the choir then
broke the oppressive stillness with the
sweet harmony of the "Dresden Amen."
The Archbishop stood at the altar steps,
directly before the coffin. On his left was
the Bishop of Winchester, clad in scarlet
robes, who read the regular lesson for the
dead.

Roll of Guests of Honor.
The service was a simple one, but the
most impressive portion of the gather
ing, was the remarkable quietude which
pervaded the vast audience. As quietly as
they came, so 'the thousands departed,
having in* honor of England's great sov
ereign taken part in the largest and most
remarkable funeral service ever held in
San Francisco.
Forty police officers, twelve firemen,
twelve Red Cross nurses, three surgeons
and an ambulance were On duty in the
hall, . but the services of none of them
were required.
The orchestra under the .direction of
Dr. H. J. Stewart, who wore hla- robes,
then played a weirdly sublime fu
neral march, during which the British
and American flags were half-masted on
the flagpoles . in front of the platform,
little Miss Charlotte d'Evelyn raising the
British flag and Miss Gertrude Elliott
hoisting the stars and stripes. Both flags
were draped In crape. At the close of the
funeral march the entire audience joined
the massed choirs in singing the late
Queen's favorite hymn, "Nearer, My God,
to Thee," which was followed by the
invocation, delivered by Bishop Nichols.
The burial service of the English liturgy
was then read by the Bishop, and Rev.-
Dr. Gardner read the psalter. Rev. Dr.-
Clampett read the lesson, consisting of
chapter 20, First Corinthians. Tenny- V
son's beautiful poem, "Crossing the Bar,"
was feelingly sung by a quartet consist
ing of Miss Millie Plynn, Mrs. Birmings
ham. Mr. Fortesque and Mr. Kneiss, the
music having been composed by Dr. Stew
art. The choir and audience then sang
"Rock of Ages," after which Rev. Dr.
Hemi>hill offered up prayers for the Eng
lish royal family. ''Abide With Me" was
then sung by tho choirs and audience.
Chopin's never to be , forgotten funeral
march was then played by the orchestra,
led by ."Wallace A. Sabin,- and as the sol
emn strains fell over the hushed audience
men and women were seen weeping in j
every part of the building.
Fourteen thousand voices then joined in
singing "God Save Our Gracious King,"
and with the benediction, pronounced by
Rev. Dr. Guthrie, the service came to an
end.
Impressive Service of the Dead.
The interior of the Pavilion was In keep
ing with the solemn occasion. Â»Every
ray of light was shut out by covering the
windows with black paper, more than 12,
000 square yards being used for that pur
pose. Around the gallery draperies of
black and white were gracefully testooned.
wreaths of laurel and "Imperial violets
being hung at regular Intervals. At the
Polk-street end of the Pavilion the plat-'
form was erected on which the invited
guests were seated. Back, of the plat
form a canopy forty feet high had been
built. It was artistically draped In biack,
white and imperial purple, the same colors
pervading around the platform. Shields
of American and British flags were fas
tened at each side of the canopy.' On -the
purple body of the canopy a royal crown,
made of English dafodlls, appeared, the
Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack en
twining the lloral piece. Beneath the
crown appeared in azaleas the words,
"Victoria, R. I:; Memoriae Suae, Pax."
At the front of the platform were two
flagpoles, which were used (during the
service for raising the American and
British flags. A lectern from Trinity
church was placed directly in the front
center of the platform and was flanked
by a floral cross of orchids and laurels
and a gigantic flower vase of roses.' The
cross bore white satin streamers, with the
words, "Simply to Thy Cross I Cling,"
and the vase had purple silk, streamers
with the words, "Peace, Peace, Peace,"
which are said to have been the last
words of the Queen. Laurel, evergreen,
lilies and other flowers were freely used
in the decoration of the platform. The
choir of 400 voices and the orchestra of
fifty men were on the main floor of the
Pavilion beneath the platform. For an
hour before the service commenced a bell,
placed high up in the rafters, was tolled
at half-minute Intervals and continued its
mournful sound until the conclusion of
the opening funeral march.
At 2:30 p. m. the sound of the bagpipes
was heard approaching and slowly the in
vited guests marched into tho Pavilion.
At the head of the procession were Dr
d'Evelyn in the uniform of the Frontier
Light Horse and Walter N. Will of the
Imperial Light Horse in khaki uniform.
Behind them came Pipers I. N". R. Sor
ensdale and Adam A. Ross, playing the
"Lament of the Clans." Then followed
the clergy, consular corps in uniform,
army and navy officers in uniform, Na
tional Guard officials in uniform, civic and
State officials, distinguished citizens and
the officiating clergy in their robes. The
entire audience rose as the procession
came into view and remained standing.
It was a sight never to be forgotten and
deeply Impressed itself on all who were
present. The weird, walling notes of the
bagpipes, the roll of the muffled drums,
the tolling of the bell and the vast audi
ence, fllling every corner of the big Pa
vilion, formed a spectacle the like of
which has never been seen in this city.
As the procession marched on to the plat
form Consul General Pickersglll saluted
the guests, and when air were seated- took
his place in the center of the platform
immediately behind the officiating clergy,
who were Bishop Nichpls. Rev. Drs.
Hernphlll, .Clampett and Gardner.
At 1:15 p. m. the doors were opened and
the crowd which had waited in silence
slowly entered the building. There was
no crowding or Jostling, and even the
police officers, used to handling crowds,
remarked on the orderly and quiet de
meanor of- the vast audience. The ar
rangements for seating - the multitude
were perfect and reflect the highest credit
on the reception committee. The special
ly invited guests, consisting of the con
sular corps, army and navy officers,
clergy, civic and . State officials and dis
tinguished citizens, entered the Pavilion
by the. Hayes-street entrance, where they
were received by Consul General Pickers
gill, Vice Consul' W. Moore, Thomas Price
of the -Welsh societies, James McNab of
the Victoria Hospital and Dr. Frederick
d' Evelyn, chairman . of the reception
committee. The holders of gallery tickets
entered on Grove street and the general
public was admitted by the main doors on
Larkln street, where "William Greer Har
rison received them on behalf of the com
mittee.
Among the thousands who flocked to the
Pavilion there was not to be seen a bright
color of dress: many were clad in black,
Â¦while others wore dark shades of cloth
ing. Crape mourning bands Â¦were worn
on the left arm by the majority of those
who attended the service.
Long before the hour' announced for
the opening of the doors, the various en
trances to Mechanics' Pavilion were be
sieged by large crowds. The police â¢ on
duty might have been elsewhere, for there
was not the slightest need -for their ser
vices. Men and women of mature year*
stood shoulder to shoulder with both sexe*
of robust youth and childhood, all Im
pelled by the idea of paying their respeccs
to the great sovereign who was to be laid
to her rest in the country far away.

tears. Men and women Â¦were not ashamed
to weep as the sad music overcame them.
Slowly. impre^Slvelv the music of tho
dirge faded away and then there was tin
shrill, triumphant, brilliant - blast of the
trumpets. Each sound seemed pregnant
with victory. The great audience arose
and "God Save the King" swelled in
tremendous volume of sound. throughout
the building. The flags which drooped at
half-mast upon their standards wer*
raised. The service of death, one of the
most impressive ever celebrated In San
Francisco, was over.

UNIVERSAL TRIBUTES TO THE MEMORY OF VICTORIA
of the Queen. ' There was a long- array
of court officials, under the leadership of
the Duke of Norfolk, parl marshal, all
attired quaintly and brilliantly and bear-
Ing maces or wands. Most of them were
elderly men who had for years served tho
roynj lady for whom they were perform
ing the last offices.
Most of the spectators expected an Im
posing catafalque, and the coffin was al
most past before they recopnlzed Its pres
ence by removing their hats. It was a
pathetically small oblong block concealed
beneath a rich pall of white salin. on the
corners of which gleamed the Jfcyal arnii.
Across tt.Â« pa!l tiie royal standard was
draped and a larp- crown of Kold, en
crusted with Jewels, rested at the head
of the coffin, which was at the end of. the
gun carriage, jupt over the gun. On tho
foot of the coffin were two small crowns
with a gold and jeweled scepter lying be
tween them.
The eight horses which drew the gun
carriage were "almost concealed beneath
th^lr rich harness. A larpe bow of pur
ple was attached to the coffin. This was
the only symbol of mourning.
Around the coffin walked the stalwart
bearers, non-commissioned officers of the
Guard and Household Cavalry, and on
either side were the Queen's equerries,
lords-ln-walting and physicians. ' All the
uniforms were covered with long dark
cloaks.

State Department Will Take No Steps
Until the Bermudez Company
Is Dispossessed.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2.âNotwithstand
ing the press reports to the effect that
the Venezuelan Government is about lo
dispossess* forcibly the New York and
Bermudez Asphalt Company from that
territory which was granted by the Ven
ezuelan Government to the Warner-
Quinlan syndicate, ho fresh instructions
have gone forwar.l to . Minister Loomis
It is believed here that the Venezuelan
authorities., probably local and national,
will dispossess the New York people
When that is done it will be' in order to
determine whether siuch an overt act hat*
been -committed a* will demand furthor
action by our Government. The impres
sion Is that the New York people will ap
peal to the Venezuelan courts in that con
tingency and as the .Warner-Qulnlan syn
dicate profess a. readiness and even a
willingness to take up the Issue there the
State Department probably will nwait the
outcome of the legal controversy before
making another move.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â The sub-com

Court of the United States, whose deci
sions Shall govern the future rulings of

AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE ENROLLED
ON LIST OF CANONIZED SAINTS
WASHINGTON. . Peb. 2.â The Senate
met at 11 o"clock to-day and with the ex
ception of an hour and a half at the be
ginning, of the session devoted the entire
day to "the discussjon of the ship subsidy
.bill. Turner and Mallory were the speak
ers in behalf of the opposition: Turner's
speech was based largely upon exceptions
which he had taken to Frye's criticism of
his former speech. Mallory opposed the
bill on constitutional grounds. . . â¢.
in reply to a question from Bacon,
Turner said that even it the amendment
suggested by Aldrlch, reducing the tlmft
for the duration of the contract should
be adopted, the total expenditures under
the bill would amount to J225.000.000, Or
$3,000,000 a year for twenty-five years. He
also - charged that If the. amendment of:
Frye, limiting the. number of foreign ves
sels any one company can bring in to re
ceive the proposed bounty was adopted,
the International Navigation Company
fAme'ric'a'n-Line) would still receive on its
foreign Heet 5535,000, or a reduction" of
I177.OUO.
The aggregate nnnual appropriation for
foreign vessels undor the original bill, he
said, would have . been $2,073,000 and the
adoption of th<\. Frye amendment would
not reduce that amount to the extent of
more than $500,000, leaving Still over
$1,500,000 to be paid on account of foreign
vessels.
Aldrich made another effort to secure
action upon the 'amendment to the ship
subsidy bill offered by himself, but Mal
lory of Florida announced , that he de
sired to speak upon the amendment and
he declined to yield for that action.
Mallory then proceeded with his speech,
which was an arraignment of the measure
in general. He attacked the bill on sev
eral grounds. Even Senator ; Edmunds
had admitted that bounties are in contra
vention of the constitution, he said. Mal
lory quoted Hanna as saying that the
twenty-one-knot and th<Â» twenty-two-knot
ships would not be increased under this
bill. From this admission Mallory argued
that the bill could do nothing toward pro
viding an auxuiliary cruiser, for no slow
vessel could be utilized as Â«, cruiser.
Mallory contended that thf ship-buildSng
industry of the country is now ln a more
promising condition than at any time
since the beginning of thÂ« Civil War and
}t needs no extraneous aid to make It a
successln the earlv future.
At 5 o'clock, while Mallory was still
speaking. Allen moved to adjourn. The
motion was voted down, 13 to 31. Â¦ '.
ln conclusion Mallory contended that
the> subsidy bill will not. be the boon to the
American shipping which . it had been
promised it should be, while he believed
ft would prove the inauguration of a new
era In American affairs, in the matter of
giving boxuitles to 'Individual enterprises.

Judge Cabaniss took occasion yesterday
to deliver to Charles Mahoney. a bunko
steerer. one of the. severest excoriations
ever heard In a Police Court In this city.
The Judge was Influenced In a measure
to "spread himself." as he was informed
that one of the Lexow Committee was
in his courtroom, which was not a fact.
Mahoney was arrested by Detective
Ryan while having in tow J. M. Prunty
of Elko. Xev., who had arrived in the
city to take lessons In the art of mining.
Nothing could be proved against Ma
honey, except the fact that he was a
well-known bunko steerer. and the Judge
had to dismiss tha case. In doing eo he
said: "Men of your class are the worst
set of criminals unhung. You are like
a lot of vultures preying upon human
kind. You waylay and rob the unsuspect
ing stranger and you. are just as guilty
of robbery as the footpad who robs men
hv force. I am sorry the law cannot
i each you, as according to it you are
not even a vagrant. I convicted this man
of vagrancy and sentenced him to sixty
day?, but the Superior Court reversed
dip, and it is time the law was amended."
James Hayes and James Watson, two
bunko steerers, who swindled Frederick
Hoeher. a visitor from Freeport, 111., last
Tuesday, were up before Judge Conlan
yesterday and the case3 were dismissed,
as there was not sufficient evidence to
convict.

Last clÂ»rht the ga.p of thirty years which
fcas reached between the Crowley broth
ers was dosed. The meeting took place
In tke younger brother's drugstore at Mc-
Allister and Franklin streets. A bronxed
man entered and addressed the spruce
doctor by name. Then came recognition
and an aitectlnj scene, and now T. J.

Francisco. Daniel Crew ley wants the doc-
The mall from the ouelde world brought
Into the Klondike one morning a copy of
The Call destined for Daniel Crowley and
coatalrJr.ff an account of the resignation
of the phyBiclan. Daniel, divining that
.this was his brother, of whom he had had
no news beyond thÂ© fact that he was In
America, came post haste to Ban Fran
cisco.
While Dan'.el waÂ» doing* this his
brother Tom stayed at home and "Just
crowed" until the Bpirlt of wandering
came upon him, and he too sought Amer
ica and settled In Kan Francisco as a phy-
Eiclan. He rose in his profession until he
was appointed on the City and County
Hospital staff, where ha remained until
his resignation.
An account published In The Call of Dr.
T. J. Crow-ley's resignation from a posi
tion at the City and County Hospital has
been the means of uniting "him to his
elder brother, Daniel, after a separation
extending over many years. .
Daniel Crowloy and his brother were the
tons of English parents, but the elder left
for America when tha other was only six
months oid. After a life of varied for
tune, which led him into as many parts
of the world, Daniel Crowley reached the
Jvlondike and etruck it rich.

I The motion heretofere made ' to set aside the
Indictment Is broad enough to cover many of
the points now, made; and | for that reason It is
apparent that the motion, to set 'aside the In
dictment should have been granted. 'Had these
points been called to my .attention at the time
Ii certainly, would have Â¦. granted It. Not hav
ing then been called* to my attention, that mo
tion was at the time it was made denied, but
the court .will. now. vacate* Its Order then made
denying said motion and\ will grant the de
fendant's motion to set* aside the indictment.
The demurrer lnterposed-'to the indictment I
am Â¦ satisfied likewise should, be sustained, and
it la' so. ordered. "Â¦*:*Â¦*â¢Â¦ l# '*
In this case, however, I am satisfied, from
my own- knowledge and opinion, and It is the
opinion concurred In by at -least three other
Superior; Judges of* this, State with whom I
have Â¦ consulted,' that the points made by de
fendant's counsel ere. well taken. . ...
In this case I am satisfied from an examina
tion of the authorities' submitted â¢ that the
point h Â¦ made by defendant's counsel are many
of them. well taken... .Whether so or not, aa I
raid ih the cases of Sllva-and Simpton. where
the court is advised, .as It is in this case, by
the result, of; trials of - the 'same Issue In other
deoartments ot the court, .that the trial will
be , a srotracted I and expensive O ne, motions
made or demurrers intaroosed should be sus
tained, that the questions may be definitely
settled by the -appellate court before any such
trial is entered Into. -The pteople have an ap

tion or. sustaining a demurrer to thÂ« indict

court upon, such appeal the .trial court may
then * proceed '^upon w a ..trial . with the [ definite

PERSONAL MENTION.
UPON the great horologe of history the hour has struck for Californians to awake and act.
The transfer of the Southern Pacific Company into hands that make the great railroad sys
tem of the company a part of a still greater system is for us an opportunity of tremendous
import. It has been noted in the East as "the most gigantic railroad deal in the history of the
United States." To the people of that section if means no more than a vast financial operation and
great business enterprise. To Californians it means something like a revolution affecting every in
terest of the State from i business to politics. . .
With the new management of the road there should come new things. Under the old system
we have suffered almost every ill that a monopoly can afflict upon a community. The Southern
Pacific has not only made no attempt to promote the' welfare of the- State, but it has done many
things to injure it..
It has imposed upon our Industries the burden of freight rates made as oppressive as the
traffic could bear.
It has arranged schedules of rates that discriminated against San Francisco and the State
at large. . . . . â¢ .
Its officials have practiced other discriminations directed against individuals or firms,
and thus rendered even the most carefully conducted business insecure and hazardous.
It has corrupted Supervisors, courts and legislators.
It has sought to dominate the politics of the State so as to control the election of officials
of almost every kind, and in its efforts to accomplish that end has hesitated at nothing.
It has tried- to intimidate, coerce and browbeat honest men who asked for justice; . and it
has made friends of the most vicious and degraded elements and bosses among both parties.
Under the new management we cannot have worse than what has been. We may reasonably
hope for much better. To a large extent it depends upon ourselves whether we obtain the better
Chambers of Commerce, Boards of Trade, associations of" manufacturers â all organizations
which represent the interests of Californiaâshould unite in presenting to the new owners of the
road a statement of the evil conditions imposed by, the old management and ask for immediate
This is no time to take counsel with fear or^hesitation. Cowardice will win nothing. Delay
will win nothing. Action can do no harm and may do a world of good. Let it be taken at once.
Opportunity has knocked at the door of California, but it will not wait. California must awake
and act. . â¢ -, : -Vo

ALL these months, after the "cultures," and other methods, mostly uncultured, have been
used to make it appear that bubonic plague was here, the health of San Francisco has been
above the average. Neither epidemic nor endemic disease has been found here, and the in
dustries and commerce. of the city and State have gone on without panic or interruption.
Common sense should inform any one that this could not have been so if the plague were
here at the times its presence has been reported.
That pestilence does not conduct itself in such an' indifferent way. Where its germs lodge
speedy notice of its presence is served, and the fact of its existence is not left to be determined
by a microscope in a secret laboratory. It proves its presence and its. power as armies do â by the
thousands it kills.
Some scientific gentlemen in Vienna,imported the plague germs to play with in their .lab
oratory. The germs escaped, aVid before that fact was known had slain a hundred people. A case
appeared in Glasgow and .immediately the disease spread. Its presence was so ' well established
that not the bacteriologist with his microscope had to discover it, for the grave-digger found it with
his spade. So, wherever a case has appeared the presence of the Asiatic terror has needed no sci
entific announcement, but Was certified by the slaughter that followed. If the plague were here
last March thousands of deaths would have occurred before now. If it were here at a.ny date the
effects of its presence would be too plain to need any declaration by experts, domestic or im
ported. With sanitary conditions as they are in Giina, there is no other place outside of Asia
where the disease would have been as much at home, or would have been more destructive.
The conclusion of common sense is that it has not been here at all. No squinting at germs,
dried or fresh, is required to prove this. The State has suffered the loss and vexation of an epi
demic without the epidemic. The Federal Quarantine Officer has shown a disposition to have the
plague here at all hazards, and has inflicted very great injury upon California. His measure is
taken by his registering under another than his right name at a Sacramento hotel. Men- who arc
square with the world are not afraid to register under their proper names. It is almost infuriating
that the prosperity of this State is in the hands of a public officer who goes under an alias. His
superiors at Washington should have their attentioivcalled to the matter. An. officer of the United
States should register and sign in his proper name, unless he belongs to -the secret service, or de
tective, branch of the Government. The controversy has been very unfortunate for this State,
and its later phase is no improvement upon the past. It looks as if the State must prepare itself
for a statutory defense against the charge that it has the plague. The discussion has not yet devel
oped the extent to which the State can go in taking exclusive charge of its own sanitary matters.
If the Federal Government had been represented here by a quarantine officer who commanded re
spect and confidence this issue would not have arisen at all. But unfortunately the quarantine offi
cer had none of the qualities that should be in that position. Of spiteful temper, fond of au
thority, lacking in judgment, opiniated and apparently ignorant, he so thoroughly identified himself
with the bubonic plague that to deny its presence was to deny his presence also. It is easy to see
that a proper man in his place could have aided the State, have saved it the loss of many thousands
of dollars and have avoided the controversy that is now rising at Sacramento. The Treasury au
thorities at Washington should be less anxious to back up an official of mean and spiteful tem
per and weak judgment, and more anxious to 'protect the people against the vast damage of false
'reports and useless quarantine.
It will soon be a year since the first report of the presence of the plague in San Francisco.
There were employed no drastic measures of sanitation to clean. the city. There was a show of en
ergy in that direction, but it was on the surface, and did not at all touch the gendering' places
where the disease is bred. There was no drenching with quick lime or acid phenique, so that if
the germs were here then they could have grinned a microbe grin at the perfunctory cleaning up,
and woufd have gone on killing hundreds a day. But nothing of the sort has happened, and the
Treasury Department ought to have sufficient regard for the rights of common sense to accept this
as proof that the only plague here is the plague of the presence of its quarantine officer and his
few imitators and satellites.

To speak first of local effort in this di
rection, a number of prominent musicians
have suggested to Fred Zcch Jr. that he
Bfrain take up The Laton and use his influ
ence with them in ihÂ« rc-establiFhnient of
a Fyrephony orchestra for San Francisco.
It has hr>cn definitely proposed to invite
the public to subscribe to a tentative
eerieo of three concerts, to be given to
ward the end of Mcrch or at the begin
ning of April, and literature of informa
tion concrning the project will shortly
l>e in circulation.
For the prepospd three eoncorts the
Beethoven seventh, fourth Schumann and

crammes, axd the chef d'oeuvres of some)

Chadwick, Parker, may h'.po be given.'
-Vp the modest source Of my information
quaintly puts it: "Mr. Zech has now
r^a^hed a position where he can afford to
<ievota time to R.rt for art's sake without
having to depend on any financial gain
from his labors. He is well awcre of thÂ©
fact that eymphony concerts are very
expensive and can only be Riven here for
Their artistic end educational value and
Dot as a business Fpeculation."
Well, that is certainly the kind of or
oh^ptrsl leader we eeem to need here, and
If Mr. Zech would also subsidize the muei
ciÂ«uis and hire a hall to cap the kindness
I have no doubt whatever that he would
be able to stuff symphony down the throat
cf Ban FTarclsco! For we dearly love a
free chow I But hero's wishing Mr. Zech
pood luck with the enterprise if he should

task- It is a krJghtly labor, quixotic, per

From the Concert Goer of January 12
I take the following very able criticism'
of these favorite singers, who were then
appearing in New York:
It will doubtless be held hy mint people that
thÂ« time for writing critically ahr>ut the ting
ing of JJr. and Mrs. Oeorg Henschel is past.
The <v>rcert-et>lnp public of England and
AmÂ»rlra Ions since became familiar Tilth the
rare qualities of these superior musicians.
Their present tnur of Americaâ announced as
their farewellâ bepan on last Tuesday after
noon, v.hen a- programme containing several
unhackneyed items from ancient and modern
song literature was presented. They were sung
in the "Henschel ttvle." which is fa'mous for
ltÂ« perfection of technical detail and almot-t
morxrtonous In Its Â»erenltj-. Mm. Hmisrhtl's
pliant foprano t-hovis the strident thread o*
long use In developed tones, but is still beauti- ,
ful In mezza voce. She etill Fines with fu
' preme. art 1* matter* of phrasing and nuancin?
and still get* a detestable color of tone on the
Ensl'.sh vowel "a" and the short sound of
"1," as most Henschel pupils do. Ve-ara a*rc>
the critics toM us what marvelous things Mr.
Henschel Is able to do with a bad voice, and
the rhrase has be*n parroted ever since. I
eurrosÂ» i shall bÂ» laughed to derision for eay
ing; that, in my opinion. Mr. Henschel's voice
! is an excellent on*, and that its apparently
unlovely quality In slnitlntc Is due to his
method of using it. I studied his tone pro
duction very carefully In Tuesday's recitalâ
a* I had done, several times before â and bÂ»
o&jxiÂ© convince*! of trie truth of my imprâ¬Â£5iori.
He uses, habitually, a light halt-voice and
gives the vowels in a very broad wayâ with
the "smiling position" of the mouth. Withal,
he d.oes not Keep his tone deep on the breath
and so it rounds devitalized. Impotent and
dreary. He economizes breath to puch a d<Â»
rree that his tone I* not fed with It BUffl
clently to rive It life. In cupport of this
mitâ that frequently, when tinging in full
voice, his tone becomes really noble and
vibrant. I think Mr. Henschel must have ne
glected the ettidy of tone color, else hÂ« wouM
give us a. vivid interpretation whereas now
he merely reveals a vivid conception. HU
mui-lcianly qualitiesâ as evinced in his piano
accompaniments, his oomrosltlons and his
reading of municaJ literatureâ are great enough
to warrant the unusual interest manifested in
his public nrrearanceg, and from nearly all
points of view thÂ» Henschel recitals are in
valuable object lepeons to singers. |
Among musical on dits is one which I
give for what it is worth*: It is rumored
that Sigmund Beol, the distinguished Cali
fornian violinist, is about to return to San
Francisco. If this be so. then Is the foun
dation of the conservatory of music at
Berkeley, under the aegis of the U. C,
a fact of the near future. Mr. Heel's re
turn to his native town being dependent
upon its Inauguration. Both things are
probably too good to be true.
"Etuclcs" (Op. 10), Nos. 4, 5, 3, 1, 12: "Pre-
Jtidos" (Op. 38). Nos. 17. 15; "Funeral
March"; P sharp maj. and B maj. "Noc
turnes"; "Polonaise" C sharp minor;
"Valscs" C minor and A minor; "Bal
lade" G. minor; "Polonafs"" in B flat maj.
Ti:e third and last recital will be given
on Thursday afternoon, February 7, and
a Uzst programme will be given.
and the following programme from his
works was rendered: "Impromptu" in F
sharp maj.; "Polonaise" In A flat maj.;
That was training Indeedâ a little over
done, perhaps, but the principle of It was
right. To appear easy, graceful and nat
ural upon the stage is an art that comes
to few by r.atur? and to th?Â» great major
ity never, because thoy will not submit
to the toil necessary to acquire this art.
In thla respect the old generation was
more courageous than the new.
Mrs. Gilbert then goes on to describe thÂ»
severe physical training she received as
a childâ a training to which she attributes
her splendid health and spirits and long
life. "It was a very serious profession,
dancing. Beginners were often kept a
whole year 'at the bar* alonw. â¢ â¢ â¢
Our workroom was a big hall, its floor
sloped like a stage, and at the sides wcro
bars. To these we clung with ona hand
while we practiced our side steps. Som<Â»
members of the c!.i.--Â« were always at
work In this way. Then, from time rÂ»
time, the professors and great teachers
like Paul TugUonl came in. and we chil
dren would go into the center of the room,
and do our steps, sometimes singly, some
times in group?. This exercise over, therÂ»
was no sitting down to rrst; we were ex
pected to go Lack to our practicing. This,
practice began with our waking; we were
taught to cling to our bedposts the first
thing after getting out of bed and prac
tice side steps while our limbs were soft
and warm with sle^p. So it went on all
day, and we were never in first rato con
dition and ready to do our best as dancers
until -we were dead tired."
In her "Stage Reminiscences" (Scrib
ner's for Februar>> Mrs. Gilbert tells us
that Home fifteen yearr. ago, when she was
in London with Mr. Daly's company. Mr.
Toole asked Â«her how she came to bÂ« so
perfectly easy and natural on the stage.
"I forget what I answered, but In tha
course of the conversation I said, sotna
moments later. 'You know I was trained
as a dancer.' 'That explains it* cried
Mr. Irving. 'Explains what?' somebody
asked. 'The ease and naturalness and
all.' "
about dramatic art It must be depressing
to realize that the dramatic capital of
Europe is no longer London or Paris, but
Berlin. TMs Is clearly brought out by a
correspondent of the New York Nation,
who gives a list of the plays that were
running in Berlin during a weetc that hÂ«
recently spent there. These plays werÂ»
Tolstoi's "The Powers of Darkness."
Bjornson'a "Keyond Our Strength." Su
dermann's "Johanr.isfeuer." Hartleben's
"Rose Monday." Aeschylus' "The Orea
teia" (in German Llank verse). Goethe's
"Fauat," Lessing's "Nathan the Wise"
and Shakespeare's "Winter's Tale."
I venture to say that such a list of mas
terpieces has never within orÂ» week been
presented in London since the blua
stainod Celt erected his rude fort by
Thames-lake, or in Paris since first the
Roman provincial magnates came' to
bathe their rheumatic limbs In the mud
baths of the Paris!!.
IF there is one thing more than an- f
other which the modern American
manager fears lu a play It 13 a long
speech â and by a lonp speech he
means one that ryns over two or three
lines. "Cut it out." 13 his unvarying dic
tum and the poor playwrights have be
come so accustomed to this instruction
that they now accept it as one of the
canons of the art by which they get
their bread and butter. *Â£Â¦*-â¢ J
Now if you cut o,ut of Shakespeare, Mo
liere, Goethe, Hugo. Angier. Dumas and
Rostand all the passages that run over
two or three lines you have a residuum
that might be good Sardou or GrunUy or
Gillette, but that is about all. That's
what we seem' to like and that's what we |
get; what we have lost as literature v.e
do not realize until we ceme to read the
masters or to hear them speak upon one
of those rare occasions when, they can
secure interpretation. Sometimes this in
terpretation is good, more often it 1* bad,
and one reason for Its being so bad Is
that the actors and actre?ses cannot speak
the lines. Accustomed as they are to the
short, choppy â¢ dialogue of the modern
play, when they tome to a passage of
even 150 or 200 words they begin to floun
der helplessly, and when thÂ«y come to one
of four or five, hundred they are simply
lost. The audience yawns, the stage man
ager's btae pencil comes in again to solve
the difficulty by another cut, and so we
go on from bad to worse.
Tet In spite of managerial dictum It is
sometimes even commercially worth
while for an actor to learn how- to de
liver properly a long, elevated, poetical
.passage. Let him conceal from his man
eger the fact that he has aspirationsâ for
this once known is dangerousâ until his
chance comes; and It generally does come
once in a lifetime to a man who is worth
his. salt. Then he will prove true that
which Mr. Archer said of Mr. Waller's
Hotspur: "The enthusiasm with which it
was received proves, if proof were needed,
that it is not Shakespeare's long Bpeches
that bore modern audiences, but the tim
id, short-winded and halting delivery of
the modern actor."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Our friend Clement Scott Is nothing If
not enthusiastic. Witness these opening
remarks in his beautifully illustrated
biography of Ellen Terry (Stokes, New
York): "I think that when Kllen Terry
first . appeared at the Haymarket â¢ â¢ ' â¢
I never saw a more enchanting and more
ideal creature. She was a poem that lived
and breathed and suggested to us the girl
heroines that we most adored in poetry
and the fine arts generally. Later on, as
we all know. Ellen Terry played Queen
Guinevere; but at this period she was
Klaine the fair. Elaine the lovable. Elaine
the lily maid of Astolat. She was Vivien
with her mad, girlish pranks. â¢ â¢ â¢
Again dnd again I saw her as I read and
re-read Tennyson's 'Princess.' She was
the Porphyria of Robert Browning, and
surely one of the crowned queens in the
Morte d' Arthur. I Wish I could paint
with pen an oven va^ue suggestion of
this enchanting personalityâ tall, fair, wil
lowy, with hair like spun gold, a fault
less complexion, the very poetry of move
ment, with that- wonderful deep-toned
voice that has a heart-throb In it."
Charles Reade's description, quoted
from the same book, has some contrast
ing features. "Her eyes are pale, her nose
rather long, her mouth nothing particular, i
complexion a delicate brickdust, her hair
rather like tow. Yet somehow she is beau
tiful. Her expression kills any pretty
face you see beside her. Her figure la
lean and bony; her hand masculine In
size and form. Yet she Is a pattern of
fawnlike grace. Whether in movement or
repose, grace pervades the hussy."
Miss Terry. It seems. Is an Inveterate
practical joker. She will sit on the. stage
in a. serious play and literally cry with
laughing, the audience mistaking her fun
for deep emotion. This tendency once so
distressed a serioug actor with whom she
was playing that he wrote begging her
not to spoil his scene by what he called
her trying attitude. Miss Terry's reply
was brief and to the point: "Dear Sir:
You are quite mistaken. I never laugh at
you on the stage. I â¢wait till I get home.
Yours truly, Ellen Terry."
Miss Terry was born i-n 1S4S and Is there
fore in her fifty-third year, and though
her beauty may, as the poet says, like a
dial hand steal from his flgflure, yet Is no
pace perceived; to* us this fair friend never
can be old. '" v Â¦

Office, 30 Montgomery street â¢
dleton's Assembly bill 600. Feliz was
rabidly opposed to the bill, yet the frantic
efforts of Johnson In favor of it were, un
availing until the member from Monterey
stepped into the broach and unwittingly
gave the vote necessary to carry the
Few more than a. quorum were present
and the negative voto of eight had kept
tho bill from receiving the forty-one nec
essary to pass it. Johnson demanded tht
call of the absentees and still- his pet
measure was three votes shy. He | de
manded that the roll be (jailed again and
"If that were the only urgency In
volved," Speaker Pendleton. whose bill it
was, said, "the author of the bill would
consent to delay."
But another purpose evidently was in
volved, due to the presence In San Ffan
cisco of the three experts, agents of the
"Treasury Departmentâ "peripatetic ex
perts,'' Johnson called themâ and the
Speaker brooked no delay. His rulings
were directly responsible for tho passage
of the bill, which was put Into his hands
for introduction no that there might be
the least degree of danger of Its defeat.
Feliz made the point of order when tile
bills were called up as a special order
that their consideration was Irregular,
since the vote yesterday making them a
special order was 32 to 27, failing of the
necessary two-thirds majority.. The
Speaker â¢ ruled' the point not well taken;
FpIIz appealed from the decision of the
chair and on motion of Johnson the ap
peal was tabled witih dizzy haste. ,
Foster was the only Republican who
voted against the bill. Reeber and Sutro
voted with the Republicans and Kincaid
dodged the issue.
On the motion of Johnson., who felt
magnanimous, consideration of Assembly
bill 559. the remaining bill of the three
that followed on the heels of the Gover
nor's message conveying his correspond
ence with the Treasury Department, was
deferred until Monday. It Deing made a
special order along with the first. Assem
bly bill 558.
Kellz made the point that if , as was as
serted by the friends of the bill and as
he believed, rio bubonic plague existed in
San Francisco there could be no urgency
in the case, and a postponement of the
third reading and final passage of the bill
until i Tuesday, for which the minority
wan struggling, was only reasonable in
view of the large size or the appropria
tion. .
Johnson fairly shook with la.ughter. his
head tilted back like that of a gnome in
convulsions ovor the result of some prank.
He stood up, and between bursts of laugh
ter thanked thÂ« member from Monterey
for helping him out of a "very tight
place." Then he shook hands with him
self in lieu of a handshake with Feliz.
Everybody laughed with Johnson, and
Johnson is Btlll laughing. ' - s
It Is evident that the friends of the bill
expect It to meet stubborn opposition in
the Senate. Johnson said during the
course of the debate, while trying to con
vince members that the case was one of
urgency: â¢
"There are some bodies not bo narg-e as
the Assembly 'out where they discuss
things- much more than we do. I. am
mentioning no names, but for that reason,
in view of the urgent need of -the appro
priation, I appeal to you to cause no delay
here, so that we may send the bill
promptly to the Senate for consideration
there."
A roar of laughter and cheers arose, and
with the whole Assembly laughing at hia
discomfiture Ftliz tilted back in his chair
and tried to look unconcerned. He. Feliz
of Monterey, l.ad In thc ardor of his op
position passed a bill that would have
been killed on tiie third reading except for
his mistake, aiio he was not unconcerned
and. did not look it.
Fellz had been doing a stunt In addition
and his flguM-i showed the measure t<
have received forty-one votes, while ii
reality but forty members had voted foi
it. Just as Feliz arose Johnson tremu
lotisly demanded to know If Klncald die
notdealr*- to vote, and after Fellz's faui
pas Kincaid 'stood up and said he pre
ferred not to vote, though he had beer
urging Hubbard to vote for it. Kincaid 1 !
announcement disclosed to Feliz the mis.
take he had marie, but he hesitated an In

"Forty-one Ryes, eight noes. The mo

the City Prison, awaiting action by their
parents and the Chief of Police there.
They are Albert Touron, whose parents
live at 230 Winston 6treet; Milton Bran
don, 527 Kuth avenue, and Mabel Jordan,
1600 Fourteenth street.
Wednesday evening Captain Seymour
received a dispatch from Chief Elton of
Los Angeles to arrest Touron, as he was
wanted for stealing JS5 from his father.
He was to arrive on the steamer, but the
dispatch came too late, as all the passen
gers had disembarked before Detective
Hammill reached the wharf. He found
Touron yesterday at S46 Mission street,
where he and the boy Brandon and the
girl had been living. J
Touron denied stealing any money from
his father, and said he had earned all the
money he used as clerk in a drug store.
He wanted to visit this city and took his
friend Brandon with him. The girl was
also anxious to come to look for a situa
tion, and her mother was at the wharf to
see them off last Sunday. He paid the
girl's fare. The girl's father Is a con
tractor, anl until seven months ago 6he
lived with her parents on Langton street,
near Harrison, In this city. The family
removed to Los Angeles at that time. In
Brandon's pocket was found a letter from
his mother, which he received yesterday,
urging him to return home.

mining on a large scale will be carried on

The isolated situation of the Ferguson
mine, so says the Sonora Union-Democrat,
has Induced the management to go back
to the primitive arastra process to secure
values from its ores. Should the mine re
veal rich ore a modern crushing plant
may be erected. It is necessary to pack
in supplies a great distance at large ex
pense. The Gerrymander Gold Mining
Company, which has been working the
Gerrymander mine under a bond, ha3
made the final payment of J10.000 and
operations will soon bÂ« planned on a
larger scale. The differences of opinion
among the officials of the Boston Mining
Company, owning the Harvard mine be
low Jamestown, have been reconciled and
operations will soon be resumed. Work in
the Gagnere Tnina has been stopped by
an attachment.

dismissed by the plaintiff last month, but
another suit . has been riled to recover

The Legislature of Oregon U consider

changes ln reference to tho location of:
claims, the posting of notices and the
performance of assessment work- A bill
has also been Introduced to provide for
a uniform system of mine bell signals.
The object of this measure Is to reduea
to a minimum accidents now due entirely
to the misunderstanding- of signals- In
the absence of any law covering the mat

State has a different system of signals.
As miners go from one camp to another
they get confused with the signals and
the result Is that accidents occur.

What mtgrht fairly bo called a race for
"gushers" Is now ln progress. A score
of counties. If polled, would vote that a
"gusher" â¢ is the on* thing needed to at
tract attention and secure Investment of
capital ln oil lands. Never before has the
oil fever reached such proportions in the
counties north of Fresno. Â¦
Every section Is hopeful and given to
exploitation. Whatever can be done will
be done to verify the report of
State Mineralogist Cooper to the general
effect that other oil regions of great fer- I
tility yet undiscovered exist in California.
The incorporation of oil companies goes
steadily on and the dealers in oil well sup
plies are filling their coffers in return for
paraphernalia which will decide whether I
it is a "gusher" or a "dry well." |
Discoveries in Texas do not jar the con
fidence of the California petroleum men,
for they reason that consumption will In
crease at home, as it has ever since any
thing like an adequate Bupply of oil could
be had as a basis for contract making.

The Tri-Weekly Promoter, published at
Willows, reports:
Practically all the land ln the oil belt of
this county has been taken up.. Everybody now
wants to buy. Even those who had no faith
in the existence of oil in our county are load
ing up with stock and the boom seems to bo
near at hand. The boring continues and each
etratum seems to be more assuring and it is
said to be identical with what the experts eay
it should be.
"The residents of Shasta County," says
the Redding Searchlight, "have gone oil
mad." It then goes on to give particulars
as follows:
During the past two months it is estimated
that no less han 600 locations of petroleum
placer claims have been filed with the County
Recorder, and the number is still increaBiw.
The fact has developed that certain Â«ecticms
of land have been located . by no lesa than five
different claimants, and the results which will
follow the discovery of oil on the supposed oil
belt are looked upon with the irreatest satis
faction by the lawyers of the community, who
realize the fortunes ln Btore for them ln the
form of fat fees when the several claimants
shall attempt to establish their titles - to the.
land. â¢;'- i -
In all directions the bonding of lands
is going on. If another Kern River dis
trict is not discovered it will not be for.
lack of searching. The "oil expert" is
making money telling lncorporatbrs of
companies what he thinks about the re
spective tracts. of land that they have se
lected for their exploitation.
Considerable interest centers ln the
"test" bill in Sacramento, which the Los
Angeles Record now attributes to the
Standard Oil. and ln the still active con
troversy between the mineral claimant
and the scripper.
There has been a large extension of the
area of operations ln the Sunset field
within a few months. In Santa Barbara
County the drillers have been active in
tho north. The Western Union well on
the Correaga ranch is reported to be down
2000 feet. There has been less activity in
drilling at Summerland than previously,
but tank building has progressed. The
facts concerning recent discoveries of oil
in the northern counties have all been
mentioned in the telegraphic news. The
Bakersfteld correspondent of the Los An
geles Times writes:
Mckittrlck is about to participate in a gen
eral revival, due Â«o the fact that the railroad
companies have almost caught up with the big
lead gained by the producers during the past
year. The new oil cars are beginning to ar
rive, the nrst having presented Itself yester
day. It is an Immense affair, having a ca
pacity of 300 berrels, twice that of the old car.
In order to locate the center of gravity aa
near the track as possible, the builders have
flattened It at the bottom. A cross section
would look something like a triangle witfi its
sides and base bowed out. As there are sixty
of these cara in course of construction, the
promise of greater facilities for getting the oil
to market are satisfying. This camp also will
soon be ln better position for delivery, as the
two-and-a-half-mlle extension parallels the
strike and gives opportunity all along the line
to conduct the oil from the wells by means of
pipe systems, which are bound because, of their
shortness to prove equal to all demands.
Jay Cleveland, vice president of the
Philadelphia and Arizona Mining Com
pany and manager of the Minnesota mine
at Chloride, Ariz., Bays that If freight
rates can be lowered sufficiently the fur
naces in Arizona would probably all use
California petroleum in lieu of coal.
The lack of bricks at Bakersfield, with
which to wall up bojlers and build "fire
boxes, has delayed thÂ« opening up of some
wells in Kern County. The Bakersfield
Californian reports that several parties
were recently searching through Bakers
field for 2000 bricks and could not get
! them. Neither of the brickyards ln Kern
had a supply on hand. Others who had
them would not dispose of them. Bricks
will have to be shipped in from the out-
Blde to meet Immediate demands.
The- Paso Robles Record says that ar
rangements havo been made for sinking
wells on the Henry ranch, south of Tem
pleton.
As a rule oil wells do not Increase their
flow without assistance, especially if they
are tried producers and have been hitting
a steady gait for several months. There
are exceptions, and the latest is an old
well at Summerland, which, apparently
without reason, has Increased Its flow
from ten to 100 barrels per day. This .well
Is drilled ln the ocean bed 250 feet from
the shore. Since September It has been
producing at the rate of ten barrels, but
has Just become one of the star produc
ers in the Summerland field.
Filings on desert oil lands In San Diego
Counts continue, scarcely a day passing
withouT the filing of a number of notices
ln the Recorder s office. J. H. Richey
has taken up 1120 acres for a large number
of San Diego parties, each person being
entitled to twenty acres,- and Edwin A.
de Haven has filed upon 120 acres for
himself. Both tracts are in tho southern
part of the county. Claims have also
been taken up by R. G. Melros'e and F. E.
Feeler.
The Los Angeles Times says:
Not content with the almost unlimited field
for operation ln the recognised oil districts of
the State, oil prospectors have turned covetous
eyes toward the islands of the sea. - San Nico
las Island, lying sixty miles off the Ventura
coast, will be the next undeveloped field entered
by the prospector, for it is said* there are sur
face indications on that island which point to
rich deposits of the precious fluid below the
surface. : A party of engineers and geologists
will sail from San Pedro for San Nicolas to
make a study of the formation of the various
sections. John Suplee of this' city, a man of
considerable capital, heads the party, and the
scientists who will accompany him are Profes
sor Philip Jonea of the State. University, Engi
neer J. B. Llpplnoott and Geologist -Homer

The Coalinga field will have a water
supply, to be furnished by the Valley
Water Company, which has recently been
Incorporated. The water plant will cost
*30.000. "
The Bakersfleld Californian reports that
the Dabneys have sold their leases on 110
acres of El Dorado property in the Mc-
Kittrlck district. The price Is not given
out. There are eight wells on the tract,
all but one or two being completed. A.
H. Butler and A. L. Devendorf are the
purchasers. They are believed to repre
sent the Santa Fe Company.
The Los Angeles Stock Exchange has
adopted resolutions against , the â¢ "flash
test" bill before the Legislature, declar
ing that the proposed legislation- is a
Berious menace to the petroleum Industry
of California," and that it would be, ? In eN
feet, a prohibition of the refining of Cali
fornia oils, which is . now an Important
industry, and the passage of the proposed
law would give to the refiners of Eastern
oils a monopoly of supplying Illuminating
oils to the trade In' this State. Â¦

Better times seem !n store for the own
ers of mining properties who need monty
to develop them. The Eastern man cf
money, Beekingr some place ln which to
safely and profitably invest his money. Is
turning to the mines. Proof of this la
found in the statements made by E. Rich,
an Eastern banker, in a recent article ln
the National Banker. Mr. Rich says the
old-fashioned prejudice Â¦ against Invest
ments in mines was -based upon losses,
while it was overlooked that millions are
annually lost in corn,' wheat or pork spec
ulation. Mr. Rich writes, ln part,; as fol
lows:
There Is yearly as much money Invested In
mining as there Is in banking, but banking
does not prove aa safe or â¢ as profitable as
mining, in a time of prosperity the average
banking dividends seldom exceed 8 per cent
a year. That the number of dividend paying
mining companies is larger than all other com
bined industries is fully sustained by statis
tics. That mining produces quicker and greater
profits than any other Industrial pursuit is
evidenced, by the score of multi-millionaires,
rhat there are risks ln mining as well as in
other pursuits is well known to all reasonable
minds, but that the Immense fortunes of the
Mackays.. the Fairs, the Fields, the Sharons,
the Baldwins and hundreds of others, are due
to mining cannot be denied. According to the
census there is less than one hundredth part
pi our industrial population engaged in min
ing, producing for one year a mineral output
or *6i9,59r,876.^If other industries were as pro
ductive of wealth as mining, we would have,
according to- the above ratio, a yearly product
of J6..959.7S7.60O, or twenty-two times as much
aa the estimated circulation of gold and silver
money of tho entire world. The yearly product
? iv .J 8llver . lea d and copper alone. If dis
tributed among the miners engaged ln the dif
ferent mining States producing these metals,
averages from $1000 to $3000 per man. or twenty
times as much as the per capita of products
of all other combined Industries. Mining pro
ducts, with the exception of coal, which Is
consumed, are Increasing our solid natural

etable or animal products.
Miners have known for many years that
general recognition of valuable mining
properties would come. Properly devel
oped, the mines will become a greater fac
tor than ever In the world of finance.
There is a prospect that the mining
camp near Mojave will make a good
showing this year. Stories from there
agree that a score of mines are paylns
their way in development work. The dis
trict was located In WM by George Bow
ers, a prospector, who had -several claims
on the hills about two and one-half milet
from Mojave. He held possession several
years by abandoning and relocating. In
1S96 N. C. Creed attempted to purchase the
entire group, consisting of probably twen
ty claims, his intention being to thorough
ly develop the same. Creed's offer was
refused Creed then offered to thorough
ly develop the entire property at his own
expense, providing Bowers would deed
him a one-half interest in the group This
Bowers also refused, and the claims lay
die again for some time, until Bowers'
interests were lost through jumping Htf
gatlon and otherwise. Since that time

The miners of Quartz Valley, according
to the Yreka Journal reports, are getting
ready for extensive operations. In quartz
and hydraiilio mining an* expect to do
well this season, having: a great abun
dance of water from the Immense snow
reservoir of Salmon Mountain.. At Oro
Flno, adjoining, active preparations are
being made to run giants steadily, day
and night, when the weather becomes
warmer to thaw the grround and snow.
The miners on Little Humbug expect to
do lively work as soon aa the weather
moderates sufficiently to melt the snow.
This is generally a dry stream, but will
be well supplied with water until late

to permit washing up a great extent of

A quick mining deal has been effected
in Shasta County. The Cleveland gold
quartz mine at Quartz Hill was sold for
$10,000 by W. M. Hiatt and William F.
Hlatt to the Hiatt Gold Mining Company.
The .deed was placed in escrow, under
bond -of one week, but the property was
paid for before the week had passed.
The mine was located by W. F. and \V. M.
Hlatt in 1S92. The company purchasing
the property was recently organized. The
directors are: D. B. Hunt of Redding, H.
B. Goodwin and W. E. Lester of San
Francisco, A. C. Hamilton of Storey
County, Xev., and John D. Ludwlg of
Marlposa County.
Trie Calaveras County papers report
that the abundance of water has occasion

The executive committee of the Califor
nia Miners 1 Association met last evening
at the UnlonJ^ague Club rooms to take
action on certain bills now before the
Legislature and to hear a report from As
semblyman Ralston as to the bill Detore
the Legislature providing for ah' appro
priation of $150,000 toward the expense of
the work to be carried out by the Cali
fornia Debris Commission of the United
President E. C Voorhlea" occupied the
chair and a large number ot the mem
bers of the executive committee- of the
association was present.
Assemblyman Ralston, In defending his
action as chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee of the Assembly in vot
ing against the $150,000 appropriation, said
that he had done eo In the Interests of the
taxpayers of the State. The State of Cali
fornia had already appropriated $250,000
for the work of building the Impounding
barriers, a like sum having been voted by
rwrpss The Federal engineers who had
fornta^ust'TS' feS^ SS S&
", oxnerimental, and he favored the ex
penditure of a- portion of the $500,000
available before more- money should be
8 Ko?r!ey e Ge n eral Ford stated that the
Government engineers not begin
thÂ« work unless the totaj aum required
waslvallable The. work of building tho
Impounding barriers could only be carried
out as a unit; part of it could not Â¦, be
done. The Federal engineers were posi
tive that if the barriers were built hy
draulic mining could be resumed and the
injury to the valleys by tailing would be
averted He argued that If Congress was
willing at the present time to appropriate
1150 000 California should do the same, and
if the Btate Legislature refused to make
tho appropriation the effect would be to
stop the work for an indefinite period.
Senator Davis, Lieutenant Governor
Neff Major McBride, Mr. Halloran and
others also favored the State appropria
tion Mr.Ralston said he would bow
to the wishes expressed and support the
hill A resolution was also passed recom
mending the bill to the Legislature for
PI A S bnrarnending the bill creating the of
fice of State Debris Commissioner was
also indorsed and recommended to the
Legislature. A -general discussion of the
bill elicited the fact 'Â¦ that the incumbent
of the office. John F. Kldder, had drawn
nearly $36,000 in eight years for salary,
secretary's services and for expenses.
The original bill .had provided that the
Commissioner should receive $10 per day
when engaged in hla duties, but that de
spite protests Mr. Kldder had drawn the
per diem for day In the year, al
though, as some of the speakers paid,
"the only work he had done was to draw
his Balary." :The Commissioner under the
new bill will either receive a. nominal sal
ary or hold an honorary office. : â¢ Â¦

disposal: A bill to regulate the sale of
the products of ..crude oil or petroleum
that are used for illuminating and fuel
purposes; . a bill prescribing the manner
of locating mining claims upon the public
domain and the recording of notices of
location; a bill to provide for the Inspec
tion of illuminating oila manufar-tured.
from petroleum or coal oils.
Commissioner Devlin said that he was in
the possession of information that some
one was traveling through the State so
liciting farmers to send in orders for
prison-made bags at the prison price,
promising to take them off their hands at
an advanced rate. He was anxious to
know if there was not some way of check
ing the fraud.
"What can we or Warden Agulrre do?"
asked Chairman Fitzgerald. "If we re
ceive an order for any number of bags
under 2000, and the order is accompanied
by {he necessary affidavit, we must under
the law furnish them. We cannot send a
man out to ascertain If every order pre
sente'd is bona-fide and that the party giv
ing the order wants the bags for his own
personal use. If he send the affidavit're
quired we cannot go back of it. unless we
know that he is committing 'perjury and
is buying the bags as an agent. This
state of affairs has been going on for
years, and I do not see how we can stop
it." .
Warden Agulrre suggested that the Leg
islature be asked to pass a bill making it
a felony for any one to make false affida
vit in order to jret prison-made bags. The
Commissioners looked favorably upon the
suggestion and will discuss the matter at
the next meeting. .* .-.-
The Commissioners, after a lengthy dis
cussion, decided to fix the price of bags
at $5 64 per hundred for the coming sea
son.
Warden Agulrre announced that he had
received up to the present time 2300 orders
for bass in 2000 lots.
The Commissioners will meet at San
Quentin next Saturday to discuss the re
port and decide if it be advisable to en
gage the experts to endeavor to recon
struct a new set of books from the rec
ords still remaining at the penitentiary. In
the meantime a communication will be
sent to the Governor, asking him to offer
a suitable reward for the arrest of Wal
den.
In connection with the disappearance of
the bookS prior to 1S96. the experts call
attention to the fact that they found
many valuable records cut and mutilated
in the disued furniture factory. While
the books of the "Jute revolvine fund"
were found to be badly kept, nothing was
discovered to lead to the belief that they
had been tampered with by Walden.
While our duty has been to ascertain and
report to you such facts as we could deduce
from the books and from them alone, we de
sire to Btate that all oÂ£ the numerous Etate
ments which have been made In. connection
with the â¢ subject of this investigation, and
which have come to our earp. have received our
most, careful attention. With reference to the
statement made to you by a fprmer superin
tendent of the jute mill that a. shortage existed
to his knowledge in the bag warehouse some
few years asro ot 32,500 bass, or Bixty-nve bales,
we see no reason to doubt thle gentleman's
assertion, although there are absolutely no
particulars of Euch a thing to be found In the
books. What he says is iiorne out by the con
\lcts employed both In the mill and ware
house, except as to the amount of the de
ficiency, which they place at fifty baleB. The
fact that something wrong existed about that
time Is shown by a very peculiar entry made
by Walden In the shipping register on June
4, 1837. recording the receipt from the mill of
11,000 bags on February 3 of the name year,
opposite which he has written a note in red
ink: "Sent out from mill February 3 and not
receipted for. 0. J. W." On February 3 there
ate the traces in the same book of an entry
consisting of a corresponding number of fig
ures in the "receipts" column. which has
been erased, and 1 this bears out the idea that
bags have been shipped Â«ln times past from the
mill to the warehouse -without any record
whatever being kÂ«?pt of them. In the case In
quesLlon it would appear that the whole quan
tity of bags shown by the warehouse ledger
was discovered not to be on hand in the fall
of 1S%, and "that thereupon Walden instructed
thÂ« convict who via in charge of the baling
department in the jute mill to send fifty bales
cf bags to the warehouse without entering
them in the mill books either aÂ« made , or
shipped, and that he told the warehouse ship
ping clerk to make no entry of thelp. having
been recelred. - Later/ H seems, mare bans
were found to be on hand than the books called
for, and hence the 11,000 bags were entered as
hating been received.
â¢ In order to suppress the fact that bags had
been manufactured and delivered "without en
tries in the mill books, the "manufacturing;
statements" made up at the close of each fis
cal year, and usually at the close of each half
year, would have to be falsified, and this is
a matter to which we have given considerable
care and about which we have had several
consultations with the present mill superin
tendent. For several years Walden was prac
tically in nole charge of the entire Jute, depart
ment. BJid consequently there are no absolutely
independent records whereby the figures of his
statements can be thoroughly checked., but we
have Been two or three of his annual and
nemi-annual statements which are crossly mis
leading.
The report further says:
The report Is a voluminous one and en
ters into the details of the examination
made by the experts of the only availa
ble books at the. jute mill. These books
only go back to 1S90. When the amount
of raw jute on hand was checked off. It
was found that eight bales, valued â¢ at
J105. Â¦ were missing. This shortage was
first discovered in the early part of 1SD3
by the shipping clerk in charge of. the
warehouse. He informed the experts that
Walden told him. at that time that he
would adjust the matter in his own books.
When the bales of bags in the warehouse
were counted a shortage of one bale, also
dating back many years, was found. All
shipments were found to be accounted for
ana paid for since 1896, except the fol
lowing:. October 9, 1897, 2U00 imperfect
bags, valued at ?S5; October 18. 1S38, 15,-
OW bags, valued at $727 50; September 25,
1900, 25,000 bags, valued at $1412 50. and Oc
tober 12, 1900, 25,000 bags, valued at $1412 50.
making a- total deiicit of Â£ft37 50. All thosu
bags were bought by Joseph Levy from
Walden, who pocketed the proceeds. A
scrutiny of the sales of imperfect bags
revealed nothing very extraordinary. The
largest sale in any year was 33.000 bags
in 1836, at a price $137 75 less than would
have been brought by good bags.
The experts who have been working for
several weeks on the books of the San
Quentin Prison jute mill filed their report
lost night with the Board of State Prison
Directors. The report shows that Wal
den, absconding bookkeeper of the mill,
stole bags valued at $3637 50. and that
while the prison books do not afford any
further evidence of his crimes there is
every reason to believe that on another
occasion he stole sixty-five bales of bags
and sold them. The books of the late
Clerk Kills were also examined by the ex
perts and found to be correct.'

of inspection of the Western division of
the Pacific Coast svstem. The president
will probably go as far as Ogden. Sac

After completing this trip President
Hays will go to Los Angeles, where he
has promised to meet the Jobbers' Asso

the case is now pending before the State
Railroad Commission.
PRESIDENT
HAYS ON TOUR
OF INSPECTION
There are few, however, who doubt but
Mr. Huntington has disposed of his
interests in the company, despite lhs ret
icence. Bankers 6ays Huntington would
have been very, foolish to have let sucn
an opportunity pass. It is not often
Southern Pacific stock can be disposed of
on such favorable terms. Huntington, it
Is believed. !s anxious to get out of the
company and that he has been anxiously
awaiting the opportunity for some time
there seems to be little doubt. Of course,
the disposal of the Huntington Interests
in the company will mean Mr. Hunting
ton's resignation as vice' president of the
Southern Pacific and he is also expected
to retire from the presidency of the Mar
ket Street Railway Company.
"The Speyers say they ha.re sold the
Ftock controlled by them. They decline
to say to whom the stock has been sold or
for what price. H. E. Huntington de
clines to say anything; so does Charles
H. Tweed. So there you have, the whole
thing In a nutshell.'
Another official, who 1? very conserva
tive and who is a stanch believer of facts,
sums up the wholo thing after this fash
ion: *
Another . railroad official, who did not
care to bo. quoted, upon being- asked what
would be tho probable outcome of the
deal in respect to changes in the present
personnel of the company, said:
*"I think there will be more of a shake
up than has thus far been contemplated.
Why? Well, we will take for example
the man who purchases a controlling in
terest in a big dry goods establishment.
That house may have Rood men at its
headâ men who have been with the firm
for years, who understand the business
from A to Z and whose services the
former owner believed were Indispensable.
But is the new proprietor going to be told
who he must employ In order to make his
business profitable? I gruess not. He has
his own Idea* and If he thinks he knows
of a man better able to conduct his affairs
than the fellow whom he finds doing the
work when he takeÂ« possession, why you
can rest assured he will make a change
in conformity with his own ideas.
"Now It is Just bo with the new owners

ownership when he accepted the position
or president. Whether he has come here
under a contract for a term of years is a
matter that future events will determine.
In the opinion of Mr. Hays the South
ern Pacific will go ahead very much along
the same lines as if no change in owner
ship had taken place. Its interests In A
traffic sense, he eays, are pretty well de
fined and are not to be disturbed by any
new or revolutionary policy.
Vice President J. C. Stubbs. like Presi
dent Hays, had gleaned all his infor
mation about the deal from the news
papers, having received nothing whatever
in an official way from New York.
"Why should they tell us their busi
ness?" went on Mr. Stubbs. "We axe
out here to look after the operation ana
management of the road. There is ab-
I solutely no reason why we should be con
' suited or communicated with.
"Who do I think are the promoters?
Well, of course, I have my opinions like
everybody else, but as for being able to
answer this question authoritatively, that
I cannot. I am under the impression,
however, that the Vanderbilts are not
concerned. Besides Harriman, the pur-
Chasers are the liockfellers. Morgan and

ADVERTISEMENTS.
The mucous membrane is made and ve^
paired from the blood and catarrh is a
blood disease and any remedy to make a
permanent cure must act on the blood,
and when- the blood is purified from ca-
tarrhal poison, the secretions from tne
mucous membrane Â¦will become natural
and healthy.
In this climate thousands of people seem
scarcely ever free from some form of
catarrh; it gets better at times, but each
winter becomes gradually deeper seated
and after a time the sufferer resigns him-
self to it as a necessary evil.
Catarrh cures are almost as numerous-
as catarrh. sufferers, but are nearly all so
inconvenient and ineffective as to render
their use a nuisance nearly as annoyinjr
as catarrh itself; any one who has used
douches, sprays and powders will bear
witness to their inconvenience and failure
to really cure. Â¦
There are a number of excellent Internal
remedies for catarrh,- but probably the
best and certainly the safest is a new
remedy, composed of eucalyptol. hydras-
tls. sangulnaria and other valuable ca-
tarrh specifics. -â¢â¢: Â«j;A '.;*
This remedy Ia In tablet form, pleasant
to the taste and sold by druggists under
the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, an1
any one suffering from catarrh may use
the=e tablets with absolute assurance that
they contain no cocaine, opiate nor any
poisonous mineral whatever.
A leading druggist in Albany, epeaklng
of catarrh cures, says: "I have sold va-
rious catarrh cures for years, but have
never sold any which gave such general
satisfaction as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
They contain in a pleasant, concentrated
form all the best and latest catarrh reme-
dies and catarrh sufferers who have used
douches, sprays and salves have been
astonished at the quick relief and perma-
nent results obtained after a week's usa
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets." AH drug-
gists sell full sized packages for. 50 cents.

During the last few days Chief of Po

Four players were arrested. Including two
whites. A' few minutes later the lottery

also broken into and a. number of players
captured.' At 1107 Dupont street four play
ers were arrested together with the keep

SAN JOSE, Feb. 2.â The floral fete in
honor of President McKinley's Â¦ visit to
California will extend over a, period of
three days. This has been decided by the

TACOMA, Feb. 2.â Two. "bad. men" rode
Into Davenport on Thursday night, and,
after filling up on whisky, proceeded to
make things lively by galloping their
horses up and down the streets and shoot-
Ing Into most of the business houses. For
tunately no one was wounded. Officer
O'Farrell was out of town at the time,
which gave tho desperadoes full sway.
On his return, upon learning of the
trouble, O'Farrell started In pursuit of
the criminals. About eight miles north
of town, near Larene, they were over
taken, .both heavily armed. After five
shots had been exchanged one of the men,
who gave his name as John Weston, was
captured and is 'now in Jail.
No one was struck by the .bullets, but
a couple from the weapons of the two men
came uncomfortably near the officer. The
other man, who, It is believed, is William
Gibbens, a' desperate character, upon
whose head there is a large reward, made
his escape, but Is hotly pursued by the of
ficers. Gibbons Is the man who two years
ago, while evading the law for stealing
cattle, stood off the Sheriff's deputies at
Harrington and made his escape. He has
served time In the penitentiary and Is
known to be a desperate man. His confed
erate, who is in jail, said to-day that Qlb
bens would never be taken alive.

The Interment was in Cypress Lawn
Cemetery.
Inclosed in zinc boxes, the corpses were
loaded Into a boxcar for shipment .to San
Francisco. Scraps of red paper, minia
ture Josses, burning punk and attendant
ceremonials incident to a Chinese funeral
were added and the cargo started for the
Flowery Kingdom, in the soil of which
all Chinese expect their bones to rest. At
San Francisco the bones will be trans
ferred to the steamer which will convey
them to China.
A few days ago an apent of the Six
Companies called upon President .Cald
well of the Board of Health and put up
J15Q for the redemption of the bodies. He
was given the necessary' certificates and
preparations for shipment of the bodies
began.
About a year ago the Chinese Six Com
panies began collecting the bones of dead
Chinese all over the coast for shipment
to China, according to the contract made
when the Chinese were brought to Cali
fornia. At Oak Hill Cemetery 147 bodies
were exhumed. After the work was com
pleted the Board of Health demanded the
fee of $150 each. The' Six Companies ob
jected to the charge, and the remains
were stored in a vault, where they have
since been held. The colony of Chinese
here has been greatly agitated over tho
affair. Rich friends of the deceased have
from time to time redeemed bodies and
the number of dead dwindled to 100.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 2.-One hundred Chi
nese corpses made up the grewsome
cargo of a car in a Southern Pacific train
this morning, and a large number of local
Chinese were at the depot to see them
start on their long Journey to China. For
more than a year these bodies have been
held in pawn by the City Board of Health
in lieu of a fee of $1 50 each that is
charged for the dislnterment of bodies.

He Is absolutely, frank in . supporting
this so-called New York- plan, which
means that he wishes to give to gamblers
the privilege of securing victims as long
as they are not caught. In this letter
Mayor Phelan asks the clergymen of San
Francipco to indorse his' policy and with
him and the police officials of this city
wink at what the statute books denomi
nate a crime.- He professes to be deeply
concerned for ' the welfare . of ! those Ban
Franciscans who leave the city to injure
themselves and he asks the clergymen of
In this letter Mayor Phelan abandons
many of the opinions which- he held un
til his alleged mass meeting was called.
In a burst of confidence he concedes that
gambling is an evil, yet almost in the
next sentence he urges that a system of
surreptitious gambling be indorsed by the
people of San Francisco. He says ihat
he favors races In this city under the
New York plan, which means that he In
dorses a scheme by which gamblers may
ply their trade at Ingleside under the
winking eyes of the police.
Mayor, Phelan has addressed to the
clergymen of this city, one of .the most
remarkable epistles which ever was writ
ten by a public officer of San Francisco.
The letter. In which Mayor Phelan adds
.a new Inconsistency to the many which
characterize his position on race horse
gambling, has been Bent to a clergyman
who could not attend the recent mass
meeting: called by the Mayor to elicit
what he was pleased to call enlightened
public opinion on the racetrack evil, but
who wrote a letter emphatically condemn
ing racetrack gambling in this city. In
sending his letter Mayor Phelan accepted
the privilege of mailing a copy, to'whom
soever he pleased. ' <
Mills' father is one of the best known
citizens of Tacoma. Two weeks ago he
ended his second term as County Sheriff
and took up railroad contracting. He
made a vigorous effort to-day to keep his
eon out of jail and in all probability will
reimburse the city as soon as the amount
of the shortage is known.
The city, is fully protected by Mills'
bonds for $1000, given by a surety com
pany, and the bond of City Treasurer
Cole.
Mills had purchased diamonds for the
Davis woman and Is believed to have
spent on her a large part of the stolen
money. He wore numerous diamonds
himself and recently had been In tho
habit of spending considerable time In
saloons and gambling resorts. He was
frequently seen in the gilded halls of
Opera alley. These evidences of fast liv
ing were totally unknown to his employ
ers at the City Hall.
Comptroller Lister found some sus
picious entries yesterday afternoon and
began his - Investigation as soon as i Mills
had finished for the day. It required
some effort last night to locate young
Mills,. whose, arrangements for leaving
town had apparently been privately made.
At an early hour this morning ho was
found on board the steamship Victoria,
which sailed for China at daybreak. Ac
companying Â¦ him was Naomi Davis, a
young vwoman. They- had purchased
tickets for Shanghai. They were lodged
in Jail. .
TACOMA, Feb. 2.-Norman Mills, aged
21 .years, was arrested this morning,
charged with the embezzlement of an un
known sum, believed to reach at least
$3000, from the City Treasurer's office.
He has been employed there .for nine
months past. - City Comptroller Lister
has found a shortage of $1000 in his ac
counts for last month. The records of
tne previous month are now being ex
perted.

I would like .these facts to be brought to tha
attention of each clergyman In the city, be
cause they were net all present at the meeting
recently held, and I may possibly send copies
of this 'communication to them. But I desire
the clergymen to understand that I have to
deal with questions of this kind In a practical
way to accomplish results and I am satisfied
by the end of the year we will have accom
plished resultsâ perhaps not as full and sat
isfactory as either you or I would desire, but
still representing progress, which some one
else may carry-, to greater lengths when the
work once has been fairly - begun. Yours re

You say that the lotteries .and rambling- In
Chinatown are belnr patronized by whites. I
Â¦would like to have some evidence of this. The
police report to me that such is not a fact and
I intend to make a personal investigation. The
reason why poker playing Is not suppressed at
the Cafe Royal is because there is no power
in the city government to do so. Poker Is not
an illegal game and they can play It In the
windows of stores without molestation, which
may be an unfortunate condition of affairs.
The Police Commission may, however, refuse
a license to the Cafe Royal, as they have to
the. Midway Plaisance, but this is merely a
license to sell liquor and diminishes the profits
of the business as a penalty, if you please, for
maintaining a disorderly house.
Francisco Instead of the year round as now. If
the Supervisors refused then to give the privi
lege of thirty days to Ingleslde there would
be only sixty days' racing-that is, thirty at
Oakland and thirty at Ban Mateo. If the San
Mateo authorities refused a permit the Oak
land track could then be open for only thirty
days, which would give the people of this city
practically;, thirty days' racing in Oakland.
All that Is claimed for such a measure as the
Supervisors recommend is that it Is a step in
the right direction and a tcreat Improvement
upon the present condition of the law. .In fact,
there is no State law on the subject at all,
which is the very condition the gamblers want.
I notice to-day, for instance, that the com
mittee of the Legislature refused to recom
mend the passage of the Belshaw law, which
prohibited the selling of pools outside of a
raclns track and this is a proposition upon
which even both 'owners of race tracks and the
public are in accord.
SAN DIEGO. Feb. 2.â Judge Torranc*
this morning' granted the application of
Mrs. Delphine Einstein for. a temporary
injunction restraining the Bank of Cali
fornia from selling the Red -Mountain
ranch; â¢which she claims as her property,
to satisfy* a Judgment for $5200 aginst her
husband, Jacob Einstein of San Fran
cisco. The Injunction holds until the
hearing of the suit of Mrs. Einstein
against the bank, and the Judpe held tbat
if in that suit the bank chose to set up the
claim that the deed was given by Mr. Ein

Legislature on the/military bill which was

and strenuous efforts will be made - to
filace the guard on a more solid basts than

MOBE LITIGATTON OVER
THE SWEENEY ESTATE
Attorney Jarrett Will Pile Other
Suits in Opposition to the" '
-Deeds.
From present indications the legal com
plications over the estate of Thomas U.
Sweeney, who made his name known by
every person who visits Strawberry Hill
by his donation of the observatory on the
top of that mound, are to become still
more complex. Already three suits have
been filed in the Superior Court to Bet
aside the deeds given by Sweeney to his
nephe'w, Charles S. Brundage, shortly be
fore his death. Following these , suits,
Attorney I. E. Jarrett, who filed them,
has in. preparation other suits from the
relatives of Sweeney's : deceased wife,, to
whom several lots were given In a will
made and never revoked by the deceased:
Attorney Jarrett claims to. have law
and facts by which his clients win knock
the bottom out of the gift deeds alleged
to have been made by Sweeney when on
the point of death and at a time when he
was said to-be of unsound- mind. The
other suits will be placed on file Just as
Boori as Attorney Jarrett : collects the
data of which he Is In search. In any
case It ' will be several years before the
heirs - will ' be In a position to- reap, the
benefits of an Â¦ unlncumbered estate free
from, litigation.

Inserted m all of â¢ the platforms of the

cut out the running for a mile and a

and only" leafing, finished under wraps.

3 Eleven^ fairjy?. matched three-year-olds

was, never in it. , Always in a good posi

1: chance, first, three lengths before Toah,
the Dunne entry. Scallywag .blew up
aftrr leading to the stretch.
The la'st; event on the card, a mile and
seventy yards selling event. ! went to
Brownie Anderson, ridden by Henry, and
second choice in the betting. Henry
brought the mare in from third position,
and with pounds in reserve beat Walken
shaw. the favorite, five lengths. -Burdoc,
at odds of 25 to 1, ran into the show.
Xearly every one of the nine starters
in the .steeplechase was accorded more

major portion of the obstacles In front; hut

fifth .jump, giving their riders nasty falls..
Favonius and Zoroaster were ; the
absentees from . the Eclipse stakes, over
on*' nillo 'and, three-quarters, valued at

keep up the first part, but was closing
very strong at the finish.
WITH 5000 spectators breathless
ly waiting to see a terrific
struggle for supremacy In the
three-year-old division.' Irre
pressible Tommy Burns astride
Canmore defeated Articulate, i Rolling
Boer and Brutal for the^yveepstakes yes
terday at Tantoran Park.. 'â¢.;Â¦'':*!' ','-, Â¦'â¢' 'â¢'Â¦Â¦â¢
Instead of witnessing a blood-curdling,
halr-Bplittlhg. rtnish, where the cruel | lash
sank deep Into the flanks of the foam-be
spattered steeds, their gory nostrils emit
ting fire, smoke and lava and their .sides
dripping with red blood from the 'cruel
steels, Canmore won by two lengths, with
Articulate second, a half-length in front
of the favorite. Rolling Boer.
From every standpoint. the race was dis
appointing, and the fact that Tod Sloan,
who seems fated not to -. win a stake or
purse event, piloted Articulate and lodged
a complaint of foul riding against Burns
.with the Judges- leaves a dark-brown,
parched taste in the mouths of many. Ad
mitting that a breeze sharp i enough to
send a clipper ship along at a slxteen-knot
rate was a facer for the horses on their
way home; th'ere was no early pace. Can-.
more, the leader throughout, crawled 'to
the quarfer in :26?i and hit the half in :51
flat. The three-quarters was covered In
l:15Â»4 and the full mile in 1:42. ,
Passing the spectacular part over for
the. nonce, as a speculating affair it was
a pronounced success, as every four out of
five patrons of the sport possessed a dif
ferent opinion rs to the ultimate outcome.
Each of the four starters carried . 115
pounds with the 'exception of Brutal,
which got in three pounds' lighter. Xash
Turner was going to work wpndersjn the
form of Rollins Boer.- the stable folks all
said, so the bookies took the tip ar.d made
Billy Cahill's colt an 8 to 5 favorite, at
which price coin enough to overload' a
furniture car went into the tin boxes.'
Brutal had worked. a mile in 1:42% with
out rulfllng a hair, so reported, and with
Winnie O'Connor In the n"nt -h"""" *">d
the next call at 2 to 1. Tommy Burns rc>
placed Mounce on Canmuie, U fcUai.iiu<.e
in itself that Walter Jennings' pride
would get away from the post this time.
Still the odds slumped till 17 to 5 was pro
curable at post. call. Kven with the
doughty Tod to guide him Articulate was
the rank outsider of this fashionable
quartet, 4 and 5 to 1 being quoted In pro
fusion. Nothing daunted by the chalk,
Mr. Lopez thought the brown colt a cer
tainty, and his. friends from the coursing
park, who turned, out in large numbers,
were down to a man.. . '' â¢*. '.,
As expected. Canmore. tried a few fancy
antics at the post.' Finally- catching', all
four straight. Starter Dwyer released the
barrier. Rolling Boer, first away, bumped
Articulate slightly, undoubtedly an .un
avoidable occurrence. , Neither .Sloan,
O'Connor nor Turner. seemed Inclined to
Bet the pace, so Tommy Burns slipped
away on. Canmore. op'ening up -a igap^of
Bix lengths going rthe .first quarter,
O'Connor on Brutal 'was first to take after
him, and when half the route- had * been

Chairman Knowland of the
Assembly Investigating
Committee Hers.
- Assemblyman J. R. Knowland, chairman
of the committee appointed by the lower
house of the Legislature to ' Investigate
the San Francisco Police Department, ar
rived in the city last evening. The other
four members of the committee will arrive
here to-morrow night. They will, on their
arrival. Immediately hold a meeting at
the Grand Hotel. At this . meeting the
committee will receive legal advice and
will learn definitely how far it can go in.
the matter, and whether it can enforce
the attendance of anv- persons whom It
may be desired to have testify.
Assemblyman Knpwlaml spoke freely
last evening on the coming investigation.
Â¦ "There is no Intention on the part of the
committee," he said.' "to regutate or In
terfere with San Francisco municipal af
fairs. We are down here to ascertain if
the gambling in Chinatown is as bad as
some people claim. At present we have
no knowledge of the evil. All the evidence
we have is merely hearsay."
"When do you expect to begin your la
bors?" Knowland was asked.
"The committee will all be down here bv
Monday night, and we will then hold a
meeting. We have sought legal advice,
and we wlll.be Instructed as to our rights.
By Tuesday evening we ought to be ready
to hear testimony.
"If the State laws are adequate, then
we will not try to make any new ones.
We shall first try to find out if the State
laws are enforced In regard to gambling.
If they are not we will take steps to see
that they are.- On-the -other hand. If we
find that the police are powerless for lack
of laws we will make new ones to stop
the gambling evil. The members of the
committee are free from any biasâ in fact,
none of the committee Is influenced by
any local conditions.' To sum the matter
up in a few words. I' believe that we can
not interfere with the police, but I think
that It Is In our power to investigate to
find out If any new. laws are needed. I
wish it understood, however, that we do
not wish to Interfere with the local gov
ernment. I believe that the police are will
ing for us to investigate their department,
and -will do all in their power to assist us.
"I have seen in a San Francisco paper
that we are only coming: down here to
draw extra pay. I wish to contradict this
statement. We will receive the same pay
as we would if we â¢ remained in Sacra
mento. We 'have to pay our llvlnsr ex
penses. "We have brought down a clerk, a
stenographer and a sergeant at arms.
These jr.en would be drawing salaries if
toey were in Sacramento, so the State win
not be under' any extra expense. I hope
that we can arrange to use a courtroom
while we are holding the investigation, so
that we can save this expense of rent, if
possible. We will work night and day In
order to get through as soon as possible."
The other four members of the commit
tee are E. L. Webber. L. Schillisr. Eli
Wright and J. W. Laird.

GAMBLING EVIL
to give. He admitted having moner
enough to buy drinks, and when pressed
for Information as to where he got It he
said he had soaked his subpena with the
clerk of the Western Hotel and had ob
tained $2 50 on It. He told a lame story
of the tight between Foote and. Truman
and declared that stories he had previ
ously told were not true. He denied that
he had at any time had a conversation
with Gaskill In which Gasklll told him
that If he should be sUbpenaed to appear
before the committee he should go to
Foote and Foote would tell him what ha
should testify to. He denied that on thn
train last night ha had asked Older
whether he should "support Foote or
'throw' him." and he denied a half hun
dred other things he has. heretofore been
talking freely of. The only interesting 1
thing he did say was that now and then
there was a quiet little game going on In
GaskiU's room, and he knew that "Foote
had lost 2500 francs there one night. He
added that Foote was "occasionally ono
of Mr. Gaskill's welcome guests."
Older was then allowed to make a. state
ment regarding his interview with Den
nis. He said: ..
"Dennis called on me on Monday, and
I asked him to go up to Sascramento to
testify before the committee. He post
pened his answer, and came back a^aJn
in an hour with his brother, who told
mo It rvas not wise for Dennis to go up
to testify, aa he would make powerful
enemies; but on â¢ my suggestion, the
brother said Dennis might testify In re
sponse to a subpena/ Yesterday a sub
pena came to the city for Dennl3, and wo
came ur> on the 6 o'clock train. On the
way up Dennis asked' me: .
" 'What am I going to do? Shalt I up
hold Foote, or *hall I throw him down?* "
"I told him he should tell the truth.
Dennis said if he testified to the truth
Foote would kill him, and I told him X
didn't think anything -would happen to
him. I told him not to be a free witness
and ramble on and' tell a great deal more
than he was questioned about, but to an
swer any quesxlons that were put to him.
When I left him I advised him to go
straight to bed and not to drink any, and
when he left he said he would go on the
stand and tell the truth. He has come
on the stand and has denied everything
he loM me."
A. J. Davidson, owner of the gold speci
men wMch was supposed to have been
damaged, was called to tell his story- Ha
said he had made no claim from the in
surance company nor from s the Commis
sioners, nor would be ray tftat the speci
men was damaged by design.- He said it
probably had been damaged by being
dropped. He added, however, that he haÂ«l
an agreement with Gaskill that. If Gaakill
could sell the specimen for $5000, Gasklll
was to get 10 per cent of it.-
Davidson's testimony has ended the
specimen episode. It is probable the In
vestigation will fizzle out after this, for
so far -there has been nothing definite
shown and such .charges as have been
made have been pretty thoroughly
thrashed out.
WITNESS MOORE SAYS
FOOTE WAS CALIFORNIA'S
BEST EXHIBIT AT PARIS
Declares the Commissioner Was Always at
His Post Murdering French and English
in Praise of the Glorious Golden State
Special Dispatch to Tfca CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 2.â The Paris commission
found a champion in A. A. Moore- Jr. this
auernoon and In him W. W. FootÂ© found
a good friend. According to Moore, Footo
was the best exhibit California sent to
Paris. |
"He knew everybody and everybody
knew him." said Moore, "and everybody
wanted to know where he came from.
He was as eager and willing to give in
formation and to make people feel at
home as a floor walker In a dry goods
store." Â¦ - â¢
Then Moore launched forth Into a glow
ing description I of Foote, pouring hot air
Into the extended ears of visitors from all
parts of the* world, murdering both
French and English in his frantic efforts
to make himself understood 'and dis
coursing learnedly on all subjects con
nected with the State, from the budding
industry of silk culture to the latest
phase in po-litics. As an advertisement.
Moore said, Foote was worth to the Sta.e
ten times more than the exhibit. He con
sidered that, failing to obtain the privi
lege of a collective exhibit, the Commis
sioners had done the right thing in estab
lishing such headquarters as they had.
As to the reported revelry and carousals.
Moore said he never saw anything of the
kind. He described the place aa being
as chasto as a preacher's study and even
had there been carousing, he said, it
would not hurt the State by shocking the
morals of Paris, for Paris has no morals
to shock. Had all tnree Commissioners
gone pn a tremendous debauch and re
mained there, he eaid. it would not have
hurt the State a bit in the eyes of Pars.
Regarding the headquarters themselves,
Moore said they were beautifully fitted
up, and he added that during the time he
spent in Paris he always found Foote
there. Truman, he said, he never saw at
all, although Truman was In town, anl
Runyon had already come home. Moore
believed the money spent had been well
laid out. â¢ , , ' *u
Fremont Older was sworn .during the
afternoon. He was asked upon what he
had based . the articles which have ap
peared in the Bulletin, and he said they
were based upon letters he had received,
statements of people who had visited the
exposition and with whom he had spoken,
and interviews with attaches of the com
mission. He was asked if Mills had given
him any information, and he said Mills
had not. but had given, him the names of
several 'persons who would give Informa-
Aridrew Dennis, the negro steward of
the Pari3 headquarters, was. thep called.
Dennis proved: to be a witness with a
startling lack of memory. He did not re
member anything he had ever said to any
one nor'anything that was at. all definite.
It was known that when. he\came to town
last night he .had a conversation with
Ga'skill. but he denied that Gasklll asked
him, anything about the testimony he was
HALL EXONERATED
FROM ALL BLAME
Coroner's Jury Listens to
Barber's Graphic Story
of the Shooting.
The lncuest over the body of William
Irving Shannon, the young burplar shot
and killed last Wednesday night at 122
Taylor street by Edward H. Hall, a bar
ber, whose room he was In the act of rob
bing, elicited some Interesting details
from Hall on just what passes through
a man's mind when he feels the barrel of
a loaded revolver in Ihe hands of a des
perate housebreaker pressed against his
body. '""Â¦-'!: â¢ '
"While I grappled with Wilson," said
Hall. "I felt as' though I was belngr shot
full of holes from tip to toe." Continu
ing, Hall told of - having wrenched the
menacing revolver from the hands of the
burglar. Wilson, and of having fired a
shot at him and a second shot that killed
Wilson's companion. Shannon.
Mrs. Hattie Levy, the' story *of whose
dramatic recognition of Shannon while
the bnrgrlar was In bis death throes at
the foot of the sta!r3 In the lodging-house
as the man she had surprised In her rooms
three weeks before was told in The Call,
repeated her experience and graphically
described the scene Immediately after
Hall began shooting. Mrs. Levy lives on
the ground floor of 122 Taylor street, and
she saw the whole affair from her door,
being attracted there by Wilson's cries
for aid when he closed with Hall.
Autopsy Surgeon Louis Bacigalupi tes
tified as to the nature of the wound which
was fatal to Shannon and showed the bul
let that caused' hjs death. Other witnesses
were R. C. Cohran. Amelia Baptist, John
Green and Policemen iWllson and Joy.

ended In the draft of a bill, which will be
Introduced next week. The bill ic a com
promise measure,' taking the good feature*
cf two bills â one already introduced in the
Senate by Devlin and the other drawn up
by State Superintendent Kirk, who in
tended to have it introduced within a few
clays. Attorney General Ford, in a. recent Â¦
opinion, declared that it was lawful for j
tiic Siate Board of Education to procure .
copyrighted matter to use tn the eumpila
tioa of textbooks for the schools of the
State. This was good so far as it went, f
but there was no way for the State board i
to acquire copyrighted matter, and so the j
board set about uevising a plan oy which
the right could be made of some avail.
Superintendent Kirk's bill, which was
read at the meeting to-day, provides tha I ;
The Slat* Board cf Education. In compiling j
or causing to be compiled or revising, as now
required by law. textbooks for Ube la \X\t !
common schools, may r..aÂ».u use of and adopt,
Â» ix.fi or without charge, all or any part or any
textbook *>r plate of cotter thereof at the
tirr.e existing, and if 6'ich existing textbook
or any part or plate thereof desired to be so
used by eaid board *hall at the time be copy
righted and Â¦ eaid board cannot lawfully make
use of ea!d textbook or copyrighted matter
or part or plate thereof without consent of
owner of the copyright, then 6ald board may
purchase or otherwise procure for the State
from tiie owner the right and the means
â¢whereby the use cf fuch textbook or copy
righted matter or plate or part thereof may
be had, upon such terms as said board Khali
deem reasonable; irovided that, in the jude
xnent of eaid board, such means will secure
for use ia the public schools of the Plate a
satisfactory textbook, st a cost not exceed
ing what would be required to compile, with
out such copyrighted mailer, & textbook of
equal merit.
It Is further provided In Superintendent
Kirk"s bill that the State board, when fix
ing the cost of State textbooks each year,
may add to each book sufficient to pay in
t he" aggregate for the copyrighted matter
It contains.
Senator Devlin's bill takes a different
course. It provides for the formation of
a textbook commission, composed of two !
commissioners, ea.cn to receive a salary
of $3000 a year, and the State â¢ Printer,
whose duty would be to purchase copy
righted matter for use in the compilation
of textbooks. It is also provided that the
commission shall have a clerk at a salary
of $2400. The bill further provides for a-i
appropriation of $2<Â».' to be used for -the
purposes of the commission.
The bill suggested as a compromise for
these two lakes a middle course of creat
ing a commission, composed of oae com->
missioner at $2)00, the State Superintend
ent of Public Instruction and the State
Printer, which *=ha!l have the duty of pur
chasing copyrighted matter under the
tupervipion ot the State Board of Educar
tlon. The bill will provide that all acts
of the textbook commission shall be ap
prsn-ed by the State Board of Education,
and that it will require flvÂ«s" favorable
votes to approve any act. The bill also
reduces the salary of the clerk to $1300
and retains the appropriation. '
Pre?iCÂ»-nt Wheeler of the State Unlver-
Fity rpoke of his investigations of this
pubject while he was on his recent trip
East. He said there were a frreat many
valuable books which the State could
procure for we as textbooks if the State
Board of Education were only on such
Ice-al footing in the premises that it
could treat with the holders of the copy-,
rights and the publishers In a business
Â¦way. The opinion of the Attorney Gen
eral declared the board to be competent
to purchase what copyrights it pleased,
but there is nothing to show whence
the board may draw the necessary money.
The Attorney General suggested this re
etriction. however, that the books must be
made m this State and by the State
Prlr.tor; but it has never been the inten
tion of the board to have the work done
otherwise. The board intends. If the bill
go through, to have all the mechanical
work done at the - office of the State
Printer and all that will be purchased
outside the State wi!l be copyrighted
matter and plates. At present, in the
sbsence of a definite understanding and
a lack cf funds, the State board has to
Â¦write Its own books and compile Its own
natter, adopting from other textbooks
when available, but -without Infringing
upon copyrights. As all the best text
books are copyrighted, the board of nec
essity has to pass over all the best ma
terial, or write now books embodying the
good pclnts of books already successful
and of undoubted value. # It means that
the public schools of the State are de
barred from the use of what is best in
the line of textbooks and the compromise
bill which will be submitted by the State
"board, will. It is hoped, be thÂ»Â» means of
obtaining' the best material available. .
In addition to the meeting to consider
textbooks, the board received a report
from the Credentials Committee and in
pursuance of this report granted the fol

Senators Luchsinger, Greenwell, Tyrrell
of Nevada and Nelson, members of his
Prisons Commission, lo visit FcJsom, to
day.' They left at '7 o'clock this mornini;
and returned this evening. The commit
tee inspected all the buildings, the kitch
ens and dining rooms, the commissary de
partment, the office methods, and the
discipline, but there was no time to make
more than a passing examination of any
thing. Many complaints were received
from various sources, but none of them
were gone into, because of lack of time.
In speaking of the result of the trip.
Senator Belshaw said to-nlgbt that the
general condition of the. prison was good,
and the discipline as good as that at San
Quentin. The requisition system that has
been established in the Folsom peniten
tiary he particularly commended.
It is Belshaw's idea to suggest that a
committee of holdover Senators investi
gate fully both prisons, and make a re

MOBE LITIGATTON OVER
THE SWEENEY ESTATE
Attorney Jarrett Will Pile Other
Suits in Opposition to the" '
-Deeds.
From present indications the legal com
plications over the estate of Thomas U.
Sweeney, who made his name known by
every person who visits Strawberry Hill
by his donation of the observatory on the
top of that mound, are to become still
more complex. Already three suits have
been filed in the Superior Court to Bet
aside the deeds given by Sweeney to his
nephe'w, Charles S. Brundage, shortly be
fore his death. Following these , suits,
Attorney I. E. Jarrett, who filed them,
has in. preparation other suits from the
relatives of Sweeney's : deceased wife,, to
whom several lots were given In a will
made and never revoked by the deceased:
Attorney Jarrett claims to. have law
and facts by which his clients win knock
the bottom out of the gift deeds alleged
to have been made by Sweeney when on
the point of death and at a time when he
was said to-be of unsound- mind. The
other suits will be placed on file Just as
Boori as Attorney Jarrett : collects the
data of which he Is In search. In any
case It ' will be several years before the
heirs - will ' be In a position to- reap, the
benefits of an Â¦ unlncumbered estate free
from, litigation.

Instead of witnessing a blood-curdling,
halr-Bplittlhg. rtnish, where the cruel | lash
sank deep Into the flanks of the foam-be
spattered steeds, their gory nostrils emit
ting fire, smoke and lava and their .sides
dripping with red blood from the 'cruel
steels, Canmore won by two lengths, with
Articulate second, a half-length in front
of the favorite. Rolling Boer.
From every standpoint. the race was dis
appointing, and the fact that Tod Sloan,
who seems fated not to -. win a stake or
purse event, piloted Articulate and lodged
a complaint of foul riding against Burns
.with the Judges- leaves a dark-brown,
parched taste in the mouths of many. Ad
mitting that a breeze sharp i enough to
send a clipper ship along at a slxteen-knot
rate was a facer for the horses on their
way home; th'ere was no early pace. Can-.
more, the leader throughout, crawled 'to
the quarfer in :26?i and hit the half in :51
flat. The three-quarters was covered In
l:15Â»4 and the full mile in 1:42. ,
Passing the spectacular part over for
the. nonce, as a speculating affair it was
a pronounced success, as every four out of
five patrons of the sport possessed a dif
ferent opinion rs to the ultimate outcome.
Each of the four starters carried . 115
pounds with the 'exception of Brutal,
which got in three pounds' lighter. Xash
Turner was going to work wpndersjn the
form of Rollins Boer.- the stable folks all
said, so the bookies took the tip ar.d made
Billy Cahill's colt an 8 to 5 favorite, at
which price coin enough to overload' a
furniture car went into the tin boxes.'
Brutal had worked. a mile in 1:42% with
out rulfllng a hair, so reported, and with
Winnie O'Connor In the n"nt -h"""" *">d
the next call at 2 to 1. Tommy Burns rc>
placed Mounce on Canmuie, U fcUai.iiu<.e
in itself that Walter Jennings' pride
would get away from the post this time.
Still the odds slumped till 17 to 5 was pro
curable at post. call. Kven with the
doughty Tod to guide him Articulate was
the rank outsider of this fashionable
quartet, 4 and 5 to 1 being quoted In pro
fusion. Nothing daunted by the chalk,
Mr. Lopez thought the brown colt a cer
tainty, and his. friends from the coursing
park, who turned, out in large numbers,
were down to a man.. . '' â¢*. '.,
As expected. Canmore. tried a few fancy
antics at the post.' Finally- catching', all
four straight. Starter Dwyer released the
barrier. Rolling Boer, first away, bumped
Articulate slightly, undoubtedly an .un
avoidable occurrence. , Neither .Sloan,
O'Connor nor Turner. seemed Inclined to
Bet the pace, so Tommy Burns slipped
away on. Canmore. op'ening up -a igap^of
Bix lengths going rthe .first quarter,
O'Connor on Brutal 'was first to take after
him, and when half the route- had * been
covered looked ; a . winner. Then: . he
flunked. Canmore ' was first into Â»the
stretch by two lengths, with Articulate. in
hot pursuit and closing fast. Three-six
teenths from the stand, with Artlculate's
head at his flanks, Canmore, under severe
urging, bore out, just- as' It looked as if
Sloan allowed > his colt . to swerve- -in.
Surely going the strongest," Canmore drew
away; winning by .two lengths. When it
was too late Rolling Qper came on, finish
ing a close third.* . -_ . .. *
Immediately on returning Â¦ to dismount
Sloan claimed a foul against Burns and
a large crowd collectfd, around .the stand.
Each rider was in turn questioned, but.lt.
was like endeavoring -,to-iind. the .-ages-of
a Chinaman. After. some minutes of de
liberation the official* decided to : let . the
race go as the horses^had finished. -After
donning hia street clothes Sloan declared
In positive terms that Burns had deliber
ately interfered with Articulate and Mr,
Lopez says the colt will not* be -started
again in California. Burns iwas ' equally
certain he committed no breach ' of turf
etiquette. Rolling' Boer ran a. poor race and
Brutal .a worse one. .There will -be jang

committee," he said.' "to regutate or In
terfere with San Francisco municipal af
fairs. We are down here to ascertain if
the gambling in Chinatown is as bad as
some people claim. At present we have
no knowledge of the evil. All the evidence
we have is merely hearsay."
"When do you expect to begin your la
bors?" Knowland was asked.
"The committee will all be down here bv
Monday night, and we will then hold a
meeting. We have sought legal advice,
and we wlll.be Instructed as to our rights.
By Tuesday evening we ought to be ready
to hear testimony.
"If the State laws are adequate, then
we will not try to make any new ones.
We shall first try to find out if the State
laws are enforced In regard to gambling.
If they are not we will take steps to see
that they are.- On-the -other hand. If we
find that the police are powerless for lack
of laws we will make new ones to stop
the gambling evil. The members of the
committee are free from any biasâ in fact,
none of the committee Is influenced by
any local conditions.' To sum the matter
up in a few words. I' believe that we can
not interfere with the police, but I think
that It Is In our power to investigate to
find out If any new. laws are needed. I
wish it understood, however, that we do
not wish to Interfere with the local gov
ernment. I believe that the police are will
ing for us to investigate their department,
and -will do all in their power to assist us.
"I have seen in a San Francisco paper
that we are only coming: down here to
draw extra pay. I wish to contradict this
statement. We will receive the same pay
as we would if we â¢ remained in Sacra
mento. We 'have to pay our llvlnsr ex
penses. "We have brought down a clerk, a
stenographer and a sergeant at arms.
These jr.en would be drawing salaries if
toey were in Sacramento, so the State win
not be under' any extra expense. I hope
that we can arrange to use a courtroom
while we are holding the investigation, so
that we can save this expense of rent, if
possible. We will work night and day In
order to get through as soon as possible."

to give. He admitted having moner
enough to buy drinks, and when pressed
for Information as to where he got It he
said he had soaked his subpena with the
clerk of the Western Hotel and had ob
tained $2 50 on It. He told a lame story
of the tight between Foote and. Truman
and declared that stories he had previ
ously told were not true. He denied that
he had at any time had a conversation
with Gaskill In which Gasklll told him
that If he should be sUbpenaed to appear
before the committee he should go to
Foote and Foote would tell him what ha
should testify to. He denied that on thn
train last night ha had asked Older
whether he should "support Foote or
'throw' him." and he denied a half hun
dred other things he has. heretofore been
talking freely of. The only interesting 1
thing he did say was that now and then
there was a quiet little game going on In
GaskiU's room, and he knew that "Foote
had lost 2500 francs there one night. He
added that Foote was "occasionally ono
of Mr. Gaskill's welcome guests."
Older was then allowed to make a. state
ment regarding his interview with Den
nis. He said: ..
"Dennis called on me on Monday, and
I asked him to go up to Sascramento to
testify before the committee. He post
pened his answer, and came back a^aJn
in an hour with his brother, who told
mo It rvas not wise for Dennis to go up
to testify, aa he would make powerful
enemies; but on â¢ my suggestion, the
brother said Dennis might testify In re
sponse to a subpena/ Yesterday a sub
pena came to the city for Dennl3, and wo
came ur> on the 6 o'clock train. On the
way up Dennis asked' me: .
" 'What am I going to do? Shalt I up
hold Foote, or *hall I throw him down?* "
"I told him he should tell the truth.
Dennis said if he testified to the truth
Foote would kill him, and I told him X
didn't think anything -would happen to
him. I told him not to be a free witness
and ramble on and' tell a great deal more
than he was questioned about, but to an
swer any quesxlons that were put to him.
When I left him I advised him to go
straight to bed and not to drink any, and
when he left he said he would go on the
stand and tell the truth. He has come
on the stand and has denied everything
he loM me."
A. J. Davidson, owner of the gold speci
men wMch was supposed to have been
damaged, was called to tell his story- Ha
said he had made no claim from the in
surance company nor from s the Commis
sioners, nor would be ray tftat the speci
men was damaged by design.- He said it
probably had been damaged by being
dropped. He added, however, that he haÂ«l
an agreement with Gaskill that. If Gaakill
could sell the specimen for $5000, Gasklll
was to get 10 per cent of it.-
Davidson's testimony has ended the
specimen episode. It is probable the In
vestigation will fizzle out after this, for
so far -there has been nothing definite
shown and such .charges as have been
made have been pretty thoroughly
thrashed out.
WITNESS MOORE SAYS
FOOTE WAS CALIFORNIA'S
BEST EXHIBIT AT PARIS
Declares the Commissioner Was Always at
His Post Murdering French and English
in Praise of the Glorious Golden State
Special Dispatch to Tfca CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 2.â The Paris commission
found a champion in A. A. Moore- Jr. this
auernoon and In him W. W. FootÂ© found
a good friend. According to Moore, Footo
was the best exhibit California sent to
Paris. |
"He knew everybody and everybody
knew him." said Moore, "and everybody
wanted to know where he came from.
He was as eager and willing to give in
formation and to make people feel at
home as a floor walker In a dry goods
store." Â¦ - â¢
Then Moore launched forth Into a glow
ing description I of Foote, pouring hot air
Into the extended ears of visitors from all
parts of the* world, murdering both
French and English in his frantic efforts
to make himself understood 'and dis
coursing learnedly on all subjects con
nected with the State, from the budding
industry of silk culture to the latest
phase in po-litics. As an advertisement.
Moore said, Foote was worth to the Sta.e
ten times more than the exhibit. He con
sidered that, failing to obtain the privi
lege of a collective exhibit, the Commis
sioners had done the right thing in estab
lishing such headquarters as they had.
As to the reported revelry and carousals.
Moore said he never saw anything of the
kind. He described the place aa being
as chasto as a preacher's study and even
had there been carousing, he said, it
would not hurt the State by shocking the
morals of Paris, for Paris has no morals
to shock. Had all tnree Commissioners
gone pn a tremendous debauch and re
mained there, he eaid. it would not have
hurt the State a bit in the eyes of Pars.
Regarding the headquarters themselves,
Moore said they were beautifully fitted
up, and he added that during the time he
spent in Paris he always found Foote
there. Truman, he said, he never saw at
all, although Truman was In town, anl
Runyon had already come home. Moore
believed the money spent had been well
laid out. â¢ , , ' *u
Fremont Older was sworn .during the
afternoon. He was asked upon what he
had based . the articles which have ap
peared in the Bulletin, and he said they
were based upon letters he had received,
statements of people who had visited the
exposition and with whom he had spoken,
and interviews with attaches of the com
mission. He was asked if Mills had given
him any information, and he said Mills
had not. but had given, him the names of

Aridrew Dennis, the negro steward of
the Pari3 headquarters, was. thep called.
Dennis proved: to be a witness with a
startling lack of memory. He did not re
member anything he had ever said to any
one nor'anything that was at. all definite.
It was known that when. he\came to town
last night he .had a conversation with
Ga'skill. but he denied that Gasklll asked
him, anything about the testimony he was
HALL EXONERATED
FROM ALL BLAME
Coroner's Jury Listens to
Barber's Graphic Story
of the Shooting.
The lncuest over the body of William
Irving Shannon, the young burplar shot
and killed last Wednesday night at 122
Taylor street by Edward H. Hall, a bar
ber, whose room he was In the act of rob
bing, elicited some Interesting details
from Hall on just what passes through
a man's mind when he feels the barrel of
a loaded revolver in Ihe hands of a des
perate housebreaker pressed against his
body. '""Â¦-'!: â¢ '
"While I grappled with Wilson," said
Hall. "I felt as' though I was belngr shot
full of holes from tip to toe." Continu
ing, Hall told of - having wrenched the
menacing revolver from the hands of the
burglar. Wilson, and of having fired a
shot at him and a second shot that killed
Wilson's companion. Shannon.
Mrs. Hattie Levy, the' story *of whose
dramatic recognition of Shannon while
the bnrgrlar was In bis death throes at
the foot of the sta!r3 In the lodging-house
as the man she had surprised In her rooms
three weeks before was told in The Call,
repeated her experience and graphically
described the scene Immediately after
Hall began shooting. Mrs. Levy lives on
the ground floor of 122 Taylor street, and
she saw the whole affair from her door,
being attracted there by Wilson's cries
for aid when he closed with Hall.
Autopsy Surgeon Louis Bacigalupi tes

was fatal to Shannon and showed the bul

ended In the draft of a bill, which will be
Introduced next week. The bill ic a com
promise measure,' taking the good feature*
cf two bills â one already introduced in the
Senate by Devlin and the other drawn up
by State Superintendent Kirk, who in
tended to have it introduced within a few
clays. Attorney General Ford, in a. recent Â¦
opinion, declared that it was lawful for j
tiic Siate Board of Education to procure .
copyrighted matter to use tn the eumpila
tioa of textbooks for the schools of the
State. This was good so far as it went, f
but there was no way for the State board i
to acquire copyrighted matter, and so the j
board set about uevising a plan oy which
the right could be made of some avail.
Superintendent Kirk's bill, which was
read at the meeting to-day, provides tha I ;
The Slat* Board cf Education. In compiling j
or causing to be compiled or revising, as now
required by law. textbooks for Ube la \X\t !
common schools, may r..aÂ».u use of and adopt,
Â» ix.fi or without charge, all or any part or any
textbook *>r plate of cotter thereof at the
tirr.e existing, and if 6'ich existing textbook
or any part or plate thereof desired to be so
used by eaid board *hall at the time be copy
righted and Â¦ eaid board cannot lawfully make
use of ea!d textbook or copyrighted matter
or part or plate thereof without consent of
owner of the copyright, then 6ald board may
purchase or otherwise procure for the State
from tiie owner the right and the means
â¢whereby the use cf fuch textbook or copy
righted matter or plate or part thereof may
be had, upon such terms as said board Khali
deem reasonable; irovided that, in the jude
xnent of eaid board, such means will secure
for use ia the public schools of the Plate a
satisfactory textbook, st a cost not exceed
ing what would be required to compile, with
out such copyrighted mailer, & textbook of
equal merit.
It Is further provided In Superintendent
Kirk"s bill that the State board, when fix
ing the cost of State textbooks each year,
may add to each book sufficient to pay in
t he" aggregate for the copyrighted matter
It contains.
Senator Devlin's bill takes a different
course. It provides for the formation of
a textbook commission, composed of two !
commissioners, ea.cn to receive a salary
of $3000 a year, and the State â¢ Printer,
whose duty would be to purchase copy
righted matter for use in the compilation
of textbooks. It is also provided that the
commission shall have a clerk at a salary
of $2400. The bill further provides for a-i
appropriation of $2<Â».' to be used for -the
purposes of the commission.
The bill suggested as a compromise for
these two lakes a middle course of creat
ing a commission, composed of oae com->
missioner at $2)00, the State Superintend
ent of Public Instruction and the State
Printer, which *=ha!l have the duty of pur
chasing copyrighted matter under the
tupervipion ot the State Board of Educar
tlon. The bill will provide that all acts
of the textbook commission shall be ap
prsn-ed by the State Board of Education,
and that it will require flvÂ«s" favorable
votes to approve any act. The bill also
reduces the salary of the clerk to $1300
and retains the appropriation. '
Pre?iCÂ»-nt Wheeler of the State Unlver-
Fity rpoke of his investigations of this
pubject while he was on his recent trip
East. He said there were a frreat many
valuable books which the State could
procure for we as textbooks if the State
Board of Education were only on such
Ice-al footing in the premises that it
could treat with the holders of the copy-,
rights and the publishers In a business
Â¦way. The opinion of the Attorney Gen
eral declared the board to be competent
to purchase what copyrights it pleased,
but there is nothing to show whence
the board may draw the necessary money.
The Attorney General suggested this re
etriction. however, that the books must be
made m this State and by the State
Prlr.tor; but it has never been the inten
tion of the board to have the work done
otherwise. The board intends. If the bill
go through, to have all the mechanical
work done at the - office of the State
Printer and all that will be purchased
outside the State wi!l be copyrighted
matter and plates. At present, in the
sbsence of a definite understanding and
a lack cf funds, the State board has to
Â¦write Its own books and compile Its own
natter, adopting from other textbooks
when available, but -without Infringing
upon copyrights. As all the best text
books are copyrighted, the board of nec
essity has to pass over all the best ma
terial, or write now books embodying the
good pclnts of books already successful
and of undoubted value. # It means that
the public schools of the State are de
barred from the use of what is best in
the line of textbooks and the compromise
bill which will be submitted by the State
"board, will. It is hoped, be thÂ»Â» means of
obtaining' the best material available. .
In addition to the meeting to consider
textbooks, the board received a report
from the Credentials Committee and in
pursuance of this report granted the fol

In speaking of the result of the trip.
Senator Belshaw said to-nlgbt that the
general condition of the. prison was good,
and the discipline as good as that at San

been established in the Folsom peniten

QIVE every man thy ear, but few
thy voice," would be a splendid
quotation for one R. J. Preston,
a guest occupying room 482 :ln
the Palace Hotel, to have framed
and hung up in a conspicuous position. In
his home.
Preston arrived from Colorado Springs
on Thursday, and was very modest in his
demeanor until, early yesterday morning,
when he oozed Into the Palace Hotel bar
about 2 o'clock. .K. O.'. McCormlck of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company and
"Jack" Wilson, the pet of the Bohemian
Club, were Indulging in a nlghtbap. when
â¢Preston decided to let the good people of
San Francisco know that, up to that time
he had been hiding his ' light under a
bushel. . â¢ . - . â¢ ..
Preston's Introductory remarks to Mc-
Cormick and Wilson were somewhat fa
miliar,, but by no means offensive. . He
modestly shouted that he was the presi
dent of the lead trust syndicate and that
his salary was $1000 a day; that he had so
much money he did .not know how he
could cremate it. He then requested the
two gentlemen to have a nlghtcad with
him. After -liquid refreshments Preston
became more communicative. The feats
of the- late Steve Rrodie. the bridge
Jumper, paled into insignificance by the
side of the thrilling experiences that
Preston had encountered.
McCormlck managed to flag Preston,
and from his personal experiences the
conversation drifted to the subject of the
big horserace that was to take place at
Tanforan' yesterday. It developed that
horseraclng was Preston's pet fad, and he
immediately commenced to enlighten his
listeners to the fact that they were talk-
Ing to the man. who had at one. time raced
the biggest stablq that ever happened.
Just as the conversation drifted Into these
channels Tod Sloan walked Into the bar
unobserved by Preston, and thereby
hangs a tale. â¢
Preston's tongue, in the slang of the
racetrack,, was then "running a mile In
1:46 in the mud." His stable, he claimed,
was as large as Whitney's, Lorillard'a
and- Daly's put together. On being asked
why he retired from the turf. Preston ex
plained' that he , was disgusted with all
racing matters.
"Why, you know this fellow Tod Sloan,
that la out here now,'* he explained, "he
can't beat a carpet: He used to ride for
me at Washington Park and all those
places, but I got on to his. crooked work
and when I paid him off I just told him
what I thought of him."
This was a solar plexus blow. for Sloan,
who had been listening to the conversa
tion, and . the . little jockey's eyes wero
nearly popping out of his head.
After this broadside Preston decided
that what he had told the good people of
Frisco "would- hold them for a while"
and started to", walk out of * the bar.
Sloan followed him to the corridor.
"Say, stop a minute!" .shouted Sloan.
Preston, who is nearly Bix feet tall.

Ohio's Chief Executive
Makes Positive
Statement
CIXCINXATT. Feb. 2.â Although thm
Mayor of Cincinnati has issued a permit
for a ten-round bout between Childs and
Martin and a iwenty-round bout between
Jeffries and Ruhtin in thia city on Febru
ary 15, it is evident now that the events
cannot be pulled off without coming In
conflict with the whole power of tha
State, as well as with the opposing ele
ments in this city.
M^yor Fleiachmann has persistently rÂ«
fused permits for local fights or boxinff
contests of anv kind, but, In sympathy
with the old Saengerfest Association, he
promised a permit for their benefit on*.
February 13, and kept his word, notwith
standing: the storm of local opposition. It
is not believed that Mayor Fleischmann.
will go any further than he has gone in
issuing the permit.
The brother of Mayor FIeisch.mana la on
Governor Nash s staff, and both Fleisch
mann brothers are close frlenda of tha
Governor, personally and politically.
George B. Cox. the Republican leader in
thi3 city, has oeen opposed to the fight
from the start on politcai grounds, and
other Republican leaders, including tha
senior Ohio Senator, have been opposing
the event under a Republican city admin
istration, so that great political forces
have been against the fight, whilo tha
commercial interests generally and thosa
In sympathy with the Saengerfest board
have been in favor of it. solely for tha
.relief of those v/ho are responsible for tho
Saengerfest deficit. Notwithstanding ail
the developments here and at Columbus
to-day no official action toward declaring
the fight eft will be taken by the Saenger
fest Athletic Club until after thÂ« proceed
ings in th'e case are heard before Judgo
Holllster next Tuesday.
The directors of the Saengerfest Athlet
ic Association have been in constant ses
sion to-day, and to-night gava out tha
following correspondence:
CINCINNATI. Ohio, Feb. 2.â To h!Â« ExcÂ«l
lency Governor Nash, Governor of Ohio, Co-
lumbus: The undersigned believe themselves
ju3t aa law-abiding citizens of Cincinnati aa
those who telegraphed on January 29.
Eminent attorneys assert that there Is noth
ing Illegal in the proposed boxing contest and
we are satisfied that there la nothing preju
dicial to good order or the standard of morais
in it. We believa this plan for ralslnsr money
to pay the deficit Incurred in extending tbÂ«
hospitality of our city toward visiting strang
ers Is entirely proper. The Saengerfeat waa
neither- a private enterprise nor was thÂ« re
sult of It due to any negligence or bad busi
ness management. 03 has been erroneously or
maliciously charged. Th<Â» debt concern* tbs
city* a honor, which should stand equally aa
high in the world aa its morals. The Sarager
fest board are entitled to the sympathy and
support of the people and they should not ba
assailed and hampered by legal proceedings.
The above dispatch was signed by tho
John C. Roth Packing Company and 10O)
other leading business men and firms of
Cincinnati, and the autograph signatures
and list were sent to Governor Xaab, by.
mail.
The news from Governor Nash and from
the meeting of the Saengeriest Club soon
reached the training quarters of Jeffries
and Ruhlln and caused consternation
among the pugilists. No estimate could
be learned from Manager Madden or Run
lin as to how much thoy would stand los
ers, but it was estimated that Manazer
Brady would be out about $10,000 on ac
count of the engagements he had can
celed for Jeffries and the expense he haa
been under here for the past two months.
Harry Hoffmeier, who was a member
of the last Legislature and who thl*
month assumed the d-itlea of Prosecutlns:
Attorney of thi3 county, to-night received
the following letter from Governor Xaat:
I have watched with some degree of anxiety
the developments la Cincinnati in an effort to
bring oft. on the 15th of February next, a
prize-fight, or what is known aa a boxing ex
hibition. I fully believe that the proposed af
fair Is to be a prize-ficrht and not a boxln*
exhibition. The enly way by which men's
motives as to the future can bÂ« Judged Is by
their act3. Judging the promoters of this af
fair by what has been done and la now be
ing done. 1 can reach no other conclusion than
the one indicated above. Two of tha most
noted prlae-flehters In the country na.va been
engaged as the stars. A man has been ae
lected as a referee whose sole famÂ« consists
of his reputation as a Judge of prize-fights.
Tee principals have been brought to Cincinnati
and are being prepared for thÂ« contest witH
all the skill and care which men ara> prepared
for prixe-flghta. A large prize is offered to
the contestants, to wit: a percentage of thÂ«
gross receipts, a much larger percentaga to thÂ«
Â¦winner than the loser. The hall whers thÂ«
contest is to take place is prepared Jnat as
halls are prepared for prlze-flshta. Seats an
being sold at from $5 up to Â£5 each. It Is
beyond belief that ordinary mÂ«n would
pay these large prices to witness an uninterest
ing boxing match. These are only a portion
of the earmarks which indlcat* what ttoa af
fair is to be. I think that every promoter
when he solemnly asserts and finds & person
who believes that the affair Is to be a boxing
match must smile in his sleeve. I sea that a
proceeding has been brought before a Justice
of the Peace under section 7117 of the revised
statutes of Ohio for the purpos* of arresting
the persons Intending to engage In tha coming
prize-fight.
To-night the following was received:

is to be simply a boxing contest. The aigzm

turned round and with a condescending
smile encouraged the midget Jockey to
approach him.
"Do you know who I am elr," sa'.d
Sloan, peering up as far as " Preston's
watch chain. . . - .
"No, sir, I don't," replied the man from
Colorado Springs. C
"Well, sir, I wish to inform you that I
am Mr. Sloan and I wish to have an ex
planation for your remarks In regard to
my crooked riding for you. I never rode
for you in my life, and in fact, sir, I have
never seen you before;" ; â¢
The last remark did not ruffle Preston's
composure at all, in fact, he followed
Polonius' injunction to Laertes, "Beware
of entrance into quarrel, but being, in.
bear it that the oppressor may beware of
thee."
With. a knowing wink Preston emiled at
Sloan and said: * . ....
â¢Â¦ "Well^ I' don't think you are the most
honest' man in the world.'* . '
This laEt remark made Sloan furious.
With a threatening gesture, he shouted;
"You are - not responsible for your ac
tions to-night, sir, but to-morrow, sir, you
shall answer to me. Yes, sir, to me."
What the result of the altercation be
tween Sloan and Preston will be is hard
to imagine. Should Sloan- call his oppo
nent out they may decide to fight with
broadswords at fifty paces.
Lato yesterday afternoon Preston waÂ«
still confined to his room. There was n
bunch of mall _ and telegrams In his box
at the office, but he was too Indisposed to
read them.

Will Fight to a
Finish.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Feb. 2.â The opin
ion prevails to-night that a boycott
against the National League is the result
of the meeting of the Players' Protective
Association this afternoon. TTae I Ameri
can League was not represented at the
meeting, but from the resolution adopted
it is evident that a distinct understanding
between the Players" Association and
that. league exists and that the National
Association will cither have to recognize
the Players* Association or fight to a fin
ish. The resolution says:
"Members who last year played in the
American League are authorized for the
coming season in that league only, the
new contract agreed upon between said
leagrue and our association. However, all
such members are advised to send their
contracts to the association at once for
inspection before signing.
"So member shall sign a contract to
play in the National, the Eastern League
or the American Association until further

SAN" DIEGO TEAM LEADS
THE SOUTHERN LEAGUE
Wins an Easy Game From the Al

the Box. .
SAX DIEGO. Feb. 2.-By .defeating the
Al Levys to-day and because the San
Bernardino team was defeated in Los
Angeles by the Maier &. Zobelein team,
the San Diegos take first place In the
Southern League with ten games won to
five lost. San Bernardino have won eight
and lost five. Levys have won six and
lost . seven, and Maier & Zobelein have
won four and lost eleven.
The same started out to be the same
sort of a pyrotechnic display that Los
Angeles was treated to a week ago. Sun
Diego batted out nine runs in the first
three innings partially because Ham
Iburg's arm was not in good shape. He
was relieved in the fourth by Hartwell
of Arizona, who was able to hold the
locals down. Doyle, who was In the box
for San Diego, was takun ill in the fourth
inning and was retired. Devereaux iin
ished out the game. The two umpire sys
tem was tried with great success, almost
ail the kicking which has become a men
ace to popular baseball being eliminated.

Defeats Fireman's Fund Nine in a
Close Contest.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 2.â
The first baseball of the season here
was played to-day by the Fireman's Fund
and Varsity teams, and went to the col
lege men by a score of 10 to 9. With the
exception of one inning the game was in
teresting throughout, the evenness of the
score tending to add interest to the work
of the two nines. From the standpoint of
college athletics the game was Important,
as it gives a line on the probable strength
of the Stanford aggregation. It was
shown that Stanford has an abundance of
material and will turn out a strong team
as soon as a battery is developed. Traeger
seems to be a find as a backstop, while
Bennett and Parker are good, steady
twirlers. ... ....
BOYCOTT
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
proper spirit for the fight Both the box
ers are Olympic Club men, but they fought
determinedly nevertheless. In the first
round Danziger had a slight advantage,
but in the second Leonard crossed stiffly
with his right, jarring Danziger heavily.
The third rountl increased in intensity
from start to finish. Little Danziger
fought all the way, landing on Leonard
often and hard, winning favor with every
blow. Leonard did not fight with his old
time cleverness, but this does not lessen
Danziger's victory, on account of which
he will wear a handsome medal and a
handsomer belt.
Then came the lightweights, J. Britt,
the Olympic Club terror, and J. A. Rock
also Olympic Club. Britt fought in his
usual crouching style, delivering his pow
erful left and right short-arm blows when
ever the opening showed. He was alert
cautious and ever ready. The end came in
the third round, when Britt delivered a
couple, a left and right, on the head.
Rock went dovn on his back, where he
remained for several seconds. As he was
out for all fighting purposes Referee
Smith marked Britt as the winner. Jim
my now has another chest ornament.
The middle-weight championship fight
was between F. Wegener of the Olympic
Club and J. Milieu of the San Francisco
Club. Wegener aa a fighter is distinctly
sul generis and he lost nothing of his
sleepy manner last night. As the first
round was nearing completion Milieu
thought Wegener was ready to go to bed,
but not wisely, for Wegener came close
to ending the fight with a right on Mil
lett's chin. The second round was full of
Bound and fury. Wegener caught his op
ponent with some very heavy Jolts and
Milieu fought back in good style. In the
third round Wegener's open and go-to-bed
style proved his undoing. Mlllett got
there with several on tne chin and Weg
ener went down on hlÂ« haunches. HU
seconds threw a wet sponge In the rins
bo Mlllett got the medal and the belt.
The light heavy-weight championship
was in the hands of Charles Uallivan
Pacific Athletic Club, and W. Sutherland
West Oakland Athletic Club. Galllvan
was nervous in the first round, but other
wise comported himself well in avoiding
Sutherland's swings. In the second round
both men piled -straight lefts with fair
execution, Gallivan dropping Sutherland
once by the use of this blow. The third
â¢was Gallivan's. left pokes in the face and
right lashings on the body doing: the trick.
He got the decision that, brought with It
a medal, a belt and the championship.
The last of the championship battles
was between A. J. Gallagher of the San
Francisco Athletic Club and Thnmas
Lynch of the South End Rowing Club,
who moved up from the light heavy into
the heavy-weights. Gallagher brought
all his soft weight and cleverness with
him and for two rounds fought in scien
tific fashion. In the third he Improved
and used his left on Lynch's jaw con
tinuously. Gallagher was an easy win
ner. â¢
H. W. Klnke and James Pallas fought
a special match. Pallas refused to meet
Finke on Friday evening because Finke
had drawn- a bye. Pallas was therefore
ejected from the -Â¦ tournament. Without
any caviling? Finke demonstrated his su
periority by hammering Pallas all over
the ring. Finke got the decision.

Bishop J. H. Johnson, Rabbi Hecht, Rev.

A solemn silence nrevallcd until Dr.
Thomson rose, but the Britons could not
contain themselves when with fiery en
thusiasm he refuted the judpment of Rab
bi Hecht that the South African war had
hastened Victoria's end. The Jewish pas
tor had paid an eloquent tribute to the
Queen's memory as a noble sovereign and
an ideal woman, but pointed out that she
had listened to Lord Roberts' report oit
January 2 and seventeen days later was
dep.d. Dr. Thomson seized the opportu
nity to declare in vigorous terms that the
Boer war was â¢*** just and righteous cause,
the result of Kruger's insulting ultima
tum, and that Victoria's victory meant
freedom, constitutional rights and liberty
of religion for fouth Africa. He believed
the Queen had been in the fullest sympa
thy with the cause, however much she
may have regretted Its necessity, and
thought that if her end was hastened it
was simply from her rigid- and extraor
dinary attention to her duty, which was
too great a strain for such an age.
The majority of the audience was ob
viously in sympathy with* Dr. Thomson's
views and cheered him to the echo.

Henry E. Hamilton, night clerk of the
Hotel Metropole, has disappeared and so
has $750 belonging to R. M. Brlare, the
proprietor, and to guests at the hostelry.
The police are looking for the alleged ab
sconder, who had been employed only a
month at the house from which he sud
denly fled this morning. <^'.V :'v
. The missing clerk was on duty last
nlgrht as usual, and took In considerable
money from guests, -who were settling
their monthly accounts. 'When % Briare
retired last night there wag; nearly
$1000 In coin and valuables In the office
rafe, to which Hamilton had free access.
When Briare arose this morning his night
clerk had decamped and the money was
gone. So were a number of pictures and
Other small personal ' belongings Â¦ of the
absent night clerk.
Hamilton was at the hotel office desk at
6 o'clock this morning. An hour later.*
when the day staff of employes reported
for duty, the clerk was among, those ab
â¢ent. Briare was nonplused for a time,
and then made a search which resulted in
a hurry up summons' of the : detectives.
Hamilton did not have time to remove all
his clothing. His flight had been so hasty
that he simply gathered a few odd3 and
ends, leaving the bulkiest of his possess
slons. Â¦, ; "'-'7
Briare knows little, about his missing
clerk. He was employed through a hotel
bureau in San Francisco. Said Mr. Briare:
"Hamilton came to me a month ago.
He had good credentials, having been a
former hotel proprietor at Columbus,
Ohio. His recommendations were ilrst
class." .
For six weeks before he came to Oak
land Hamilton had been residing at the
Windsor Hotel In San' Francisco. /Briare
declares that the clerk's conduct and
manner were Irreproachable during his
month's stay at the Metropole. The miss-
Ing man Is about 39 years of age and hag
a ministerial, smooth-shaven . counte
nance. He wears spectacles. â¢ â¢
At polfce headquarters it was rumored
to-night that Hamilton had taken a train
,for Bakersnejd over the SantaFe. Tele
grams with a description of the fugitive
have been sent throughout the State.

The news of the week of greatest sig
nificance in connection with local realty
unquestionably is that referring to .the
combination under one ownership of the
Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific
railway companies, with all that is im
plied by the large deal. The logic of cir
cumstances has thus fixed San Francisco
as the point of departure and arrival for
all Oriental business to the exclusion of
any other point on the Pacific Coast that
heretofore might vainly have aspired to
rivalry with the metropolis by the Golden
Gate. The enormous benefits to be con
ferred jupon San Francisco realty cannot
be computed. In addition to this the line
now extends from Hamburg to the Orient
under one management. A great stimulus
will 'be given to the marketing of Califor
nia products in Europe. Conversely, im
migration on a large scale to California,
the most eligible place on the Pacific
Coast for homeseekers, will be made cer
tain. The more the facts are thought over
the greater does the future of California
now. appear to be r and Â¦ this city, Â¦will -be
always the financial and business center.

DENVER, Feb. 2.âThfl following call
for the firpt annual convention of the
American Cattle Growers' Association haÂ«
been issued:
The ftm annual convention of the American
Cattle Growers' Association Is hereby called
to meet at Denver. Oolo.. at the Tabor Grand
Opera-house, at 10 o'clock a. m.. Tuesday,
Marrh 5, lttOl. for the purpose of effecting- a.
permanent organization, adopting a. constitu
tion and by-laws and for euch' general busi
ness as may properly come before the conven
tion.
The present basis of representation of this
association Is Individual membership and any
citizen, a cattle grower and owner, is eligible
for membership upon payment of initiation fee
cf fl and will be entitled to one vote- in this
convention:
This convention is the result of a meeting of
a large number of prominent growers of cattle
from many State* and Terrjtoriw held in Salt
Lake City on the evening of January 1<. 1301,
to consider the question whether there should
be form<-d a treneral organization to promote
and protect the Industry of cattle crowinc.
'ihe creat interest felt in the question was
manifest by the large and enthusiastic attend
ance, wherein every State and Territory but
en* west of the MlRslssicoi River was repre
mously decided that the American Cattle
Growers' Association ehduld be created and
that its membership was to be made up ex
clusively of cattl" growers. Officers and an
executive committee, recresentinr each State.
f hold until the first convention of the asso
ciation, were selected. It wa.s determined that
the first convention should be held In Denver,
as above, "and that at that meeting the organi
zation should be perfected by the election of
permanent officers and executive committee
and the adoption of a constitution- and- by
laws, anÂ«3 trwupon the convention ehould pro
ceed with such buttress aa might be called
before 5 It.
The American Cattle Growers* Association
was formed In full accord with the main ob*
Ject of the National Livestock Association,
then in Bs.Â«ion at Halt Lake City. All other
livestock interests have, exclusive national or
gan! rations except the cattle growers through
which to advance their interests. The cattle
Growers naturally wished and determined to
have such an organization of their own, which
will take all action, offensive or defensive, to
protect any interest peculiar to their industry.
It is earnestly hoped that all cattle growers
will Join this association. ' . Â¦
The present Idea Is fcr Individual member
ship to form the basis of this association,
which wllj give a small cattle, grower as
much voice on the floor of the convention hall
us-a. large owner, ;but this will he finally set
tled- at the first convention. . The only quali
fication necessary for membership is to be a
cattle rrowerand owner. At present member
ship may be secured by sending your name
and address to the secretary,. Union Stock
yards. Denver, Colo., or to your State commlt
teeman (or personally at tha convention) to
gether with SS. the Initiation fee that was ac
cepÂ»ed at the meeting at which this associa
tion formed Its temporary organization. It is.
expected that the railways will make a great
ly reduced rate for the round trip to Denver.
The association is to protect and advance the
Interest of all cattle growers, large or small,
equally, and. we want them all on the mem
bership roll. It Is especially desired that a-
Urge- attendanca be had at the coming con
vention at Denver, and any cattle grower
who can possibly come is urged to do so.-They
may be.assured that the. proceedings of tha
convention will be highly beneficial, and their
Btay In Denver exceedingly pleasant.

NEW 7 YORK, Feb. 2.â ThÂ«. Financier says:
The. New York clearing-house, banks continue
tc make nÂ»w records in the matter of general
totals. The expansion of loans for the week
lust ended was $S0,440.30<>. which surpasaes the
heretofore . unprecedented sain of January 1?
by 17,600,000. Nothing: approtehin* the totals
cf tha last three or four weeks has ever been
known in the history of the United States, and
It Is doubtful If the records now being made
wltl be equaled for a Ions time to come. The
deposits of the banks for the current si* days'
period expanded $32.494,rC0. This does not equal
by $4,000,000 the Increase in deposits noted three
weeks aco,. but it ranks nejet to it in mag
nitude. ThÂ« underlying: causes to which these
advances may be traced rest In the consum
mation cf the great railway deals of which so
much has been recently raid and to extra
heavy borrowing In tlrrn? loans. These features
are not constant, but they have undoubtedly
led to the results already mentioned. The dis
appointing portion of the statement- U found
in -the small gain In cush. which amounted to
$2 168,000, or less than half, the anticipated ex
pansUin. The Btatemtat,. based as ft ia on
averages, probably dock not reflect the real
condition of the banks with reference to re
perves at the end of , the week, - The loan ex
pansion, operating as :t did to swell the de
posit account, necessitated an increased legal
i oHerve ot eight millions and as Â¦ thÂ« gain - In
cash' was but little in excess of two millions
the excess reserva is -reduced $S.Sf>i),623. stand
ing at $24.(Â»S,8M. -Evan this amount. In view
of the unprecedented totals or the other Items,
Is unequal and Indicates that the banks, despite
gold 'exports and other demands upon them,
have, not reached the limit of. their accommd
dating power. What has been going on in
the local banking field for the past month will
be understood bÂ«U*r, perhaps,; when It Is said
that since January 6 of tht present year loans
have increased sixty-eight millions and de
posits ninety-nine millions ' of dollars. One
more Increase au large aa that of - last week
would make the total net deposits of the sixty
three elearlngr-house banks one thousand, mil.
Hod dollars. . The present net deposits ot | the
New York banks ans now Urgsr than the de
posits of the . 273 national banks of ' all â¢ thÂ«

TO ARRIVE.
TRANSPORT WARREN HAS TROUBLOUS
TIME DURING THE LONG VOYAGE FROM
MANILA TO THIS PORT VIA HONOLULU
She Starts Out With Two Furnaces Down and When Off
Hawaii the Boiler Tubes â¢ Give Out, Whereupon the Cap
tain Decides to Make for the Nearest Port of Refuge
THE long overdue army transport
Warren arrived in port yesterday
ofter rundown. In consequence
the vef ?el had to remain In quar
antine all night. She will come to
the wharf about noon to-day.
The Warren left here in August last and
has been almost constantly on the move
ever Flnoe. She was the first of the trans
port fleet to land troops at Taku during
the Chinese troubks. ar.'d then she was
put on duty among the Philippine Islands.
Since leaving San Francisco with a con-
Fiecment of recruits she has had aboard
the Ninth Cavalry. Fourteenth, Twenty
third and Thirty-eighth Infantry, and
now eemt-s home with a load of discharged
men and invalids.
Before leaving Manila the Warren had
two of her furnaces down. Her other
boilers were not in very good shape and
the coal in the was not of the
best. Captain Frazier derided that under
the circumstances It would be better to
take the southern route, and not take any
chances on the cold and stormy great cir
cle. It was well he did so. When 500 miles
north of Honolulu the boiler tubes on an
other of the engines began to give out
and two more furnaces showed 6igns of
falling. The vessel was then put about
ajid headed for Honolulu, where she ar
rived January 21. The necessary repairs
were made and the transport sailed for
g.in Francisco at 3 p. m. on January 24. _
The Warren brings home fifty-seven dis
charged soldiers and 465 invalids. There
are eight men on guard duty and twelve
members of the hospital corps. There are
107 bodies aboard, among them being those
of Lieutenant G. A. Cooper of the Fif
teenth Infantry, killed In action; William
P. Elliott, lieutenant commander In the
navy, and Walter T. Stack, first lieuten
ant Forty-seventh Infantry. Three men
died at sea a few days after the Warren
palled from Manila, two of dysentery and
one of consumption.

pier No. J. Telephone Main 150S.The several commercial associations rep
resenting the shipping interests of the city
met at the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday morning to discuss the
merits of the bills now pending before
the State Legislature looking forward to
the establishment of a State Quarantine
Board. It was the unanimous opinion of
those present that a State Quarantine
lioard would only result in a conflict with
the Federal authorities on quarantine
matters, and in addition to causing- an
expenditure and waste of
raoney do material damage to the ship
ping Ji.terests cf this port.
F. W. Uchrmann was elected chairman
cf the meeting and Jibenezer Scott Â¦was
chu&en 10 act as secretary. After Chair
inan Ijcfcrrflunn hail stated the object of
tiie mcwUiig tnancs iu. Naylor. attorney
cl the tomp owners' Association, was
c&licd ui>oa to explain the tuns now pend
ing beiure tne lx-gislaiure loucmng on
yuar^mme matters. He taid that 11 ths
pc-HGiiig Dills Deeome iaw by enactment
cf ti^e L-egisJature there would be a re
i;tviui 01 me old conflict between btate
and Federal otnciais mat in tne past has
caused inerciiants und ehlp owners the
loss of niauy tnousanas ot dollars. "Our
â¢iUiirauitine aliairf," maid he, "are now
Lxfii^K pca.ceiuiiy conducted by the Ke<i
*ral *Jo\trnment, and everything is satis
factory, with tne probable excepuonthat
v>e have an unpopular otticer at the head
cf the tiuaxantme aepertmeut. The'com
luie&ion iippointed at Washington to look
Into our sanitary condition is undoubtedly
the result of the bubonic plague scandal
of a lew months ago."
A. W. bimpson. president of the Ship
Owners' Association, said that if the bins
were passed and provision was made tor
a State Quarantine Board it would simply
mean the renewal of the troubles mat
existed between the State and .Federal
authorities some few years sso. He ex
pressed tbe belief that the Federal au
thorities would look after quarantine mat
ters in a much more satisfactory manner
if not hampered and bothered by the pres
ence of State officials.
Mayor Fhelan etated that it would be
better for the city of San Francisco and
belter for the entire State if quarantine
regulations were left in the hands of the
federal authorities. "It seems to me,"
tie concluded, "that the bills now pending:
in the Legislature bearing on quarantine
rJTiiirs are being rushed through with un
ecercly haste."
ThÂ«> following- resolutions signed by the
officers of the associations and organiza
tions represented were then adopted:
TVhereas. Certain bills purporting to be in
the interests of. the health of the State were
Introduced in both houses of the St&te Legis
lature at Sacramento, on January 30. 1501. and
apparently supplementing a bill (No. 2S4) which
provides lor a State quarantine olncer, and
tVhere-as, Bald bills so introduced have, as
we believe, for their ultimate Â«nd the Fame
xnotlve as the said bill (No. 2S4). with an addi
tional lavisnness of State money, and at the
eame time the said bills tend to greatly and
uselessly magnify in the public mind a danger
which Is seldom present and which the people
ct this Staxe are amply protected against by
â¢ir, i at tne expense of the Federal authorities;
and
Whereas, One of e&lA bills appropriates J100,-
C00 of public money to be expended at the pleas
ure of th* Governor of this ttate without re
etriction; and
Whereas, Said bills so Introduced, on January
S5. 1301. were rushed through tne State Assem
bly and passed second reading by said body
vrlth unseemly haste and apparently without
cuÂ« or axy consideration, on February 1, 1901*
Â¦ad
Whereas. Said bills were passed with unseem
ly haste on the plea that an emergency existed
which Justified 6ach action; and
Whereas, There exists no emergency In the
fcÂ».'u;i. conditions of this State; and
Whereas. X quiet and orderly investigation
by the Federal authorities of the health condi
tions of this port, said to be now in progress,
does not justify a voluntary conflict with said
authorities nor create an emergency; and
â¢ Whereas. There eriet" no rood reason why
lU'-h legislation should not be convldered with
due deliberation and be submitted to the
umal and proper criticism of the people of the
6tate before being enacted into a law; and
Â¦Whereas. The Federal authorities provide at
I 'â¢ Â¦- orpence of the United States Government a
B â¢ jplete quarantine inspection service at this
; Â¦. t, with a station furnishing ample accom- '
i: 'lations and care for all infected vessels and '
j-:sonfi; aa<l

license to practice 14.W. When Alexander
Leslie invaded .Virginia the young Jurist
again took up arms, returning to his legal
occupation again the following year.
By successive steps he rose in legislative
and Judicial prestige till in 1797 he was
appointed an envoy to France. On his
return the next year President Adams
offered him a seat. on the supreme bench,
but he declined it to take up politics, ana
in 1799 was elected, to Congress.
In 1799 he was appointed Secretary of
State, and in January, 1801, was appointed
Chief Justice of the - Supreme Court on
the resignation of Chief Justice Ellsworth.
He took his seat at the opening of .the
February term. The thirty volumes of
reports containing his opinions form a
lasting monument to his ability and learn
ing, stamping him as the best qualified
man in the nation for the position he held.
He died In the spring of 1835, In Phila

"Do I think these big consolidations
tend toward Government ownership ?". he
continued." /:. "Well, no. It will be a long
time before the Government will go into
the raUroad business. 1 do believe, though,
that the deal will have an important effect
on rate matters. It will certainly put . a
stop to this fearful slashing of rates, and
this is bound to benefit both the railroads
and their patrons. I am Inclined to think
the Vanderbllts are* mixed up In the deal,
though; of course, I am not in a position
