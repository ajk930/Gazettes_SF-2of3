Jordan to enforce 'itscipllne. Professor
Howard, it is asserted, was grossly dere

McAlister. Death and Campbell were each
en the stand. Their testimony was on the
line that they were acting on a generous
impulse when they took the 'girl out of
the saloon to the hack. They claim that
ehe wai "Jolly drunk" for a time In tha
hack room of Saal's saloon; said she was
Jok'r.g and laughing after the first drink;
that she became "dopy" after taking the
absinthe and then became dead drunk.

Tvculd do her good and had taken her

Other Victims In View.
The hack. It would appear from the
statements made by the prisoners, was
not intended for the party at first, but
for McAllster. Kerr and two young wo
men whose names McAlister refused to di
vulge on the ground that their names had
not been mentioned before and he did
not want to cause them annoyance. The
story as told by each defendant appeared
plausible, explanatory and reasonable,
but conflicted with the testimony of the
hackman and the alleged confessions of
Death and Campbell as Introduced by the
State and admitted as evidence. The
State, which was beaten yesterday In the
effort to Introduce the confession said to
have been made by Campbell, succeeded
In getting it all in In even more detailed
manner than would have been possible
yesterday.
To-morrow the summing up will occur
and probably the case will be left with the
Jury about sundown, although It may be
that Judge Dixon will defer the charjre
to the Jury' until Friday.
When Judge Dixon opened court coun
sel for the accused asked that Schul
thorpa, the hack driver, be recalled so
that he might be confronted with the rec
ord of his conviction of a crime of which
he had previously been found guilty.
Judge Dixon denied the request on, the
ground that the point sought* to be made
against Scbulthorpe was Immaterial.
ed with her, but had never been to any
social affairs with her. He did not speak
to her on the evening of the ISth when
he first saw her.' because he did not think
she bad seen him.
The witness said he and Kerr walked
to Saal's saloon. Death came out of the
back room and ordered drinks. McAllster
asked Death whether he might Join the
party in the back room and Death replied
that he would ask the girl,' Jennie Boss
chleter. .Afterward he called to McAllster
to come In. Subsequently the witness or
dered a bottle of champagne. The girl
drank two glasses of wine and then ap
peared to be "pretty full." There was a
hack outside of the saloon and it was
thought that a drive would revive her.
Kerr and Campbell went out and started
down the street. The witness and Death
got In the hack with the girl and overtook
Kerr. and. Campbell and at the witness'
invitation they entered, the hack. They
all then. drove up to the Goffle road, In
tending to stop at Lee's place, but when
they reached there it was closed. Then
they â¢ turned â¢ around to drive home', and
had entered the rock road when the girl
complained of feeling ill and asked to be
taken out of the carriage. Placing the
hackman's blanket on the ground, they
laid the girl upon it and tried to revive
her", 1 but without avail. Placing thÂ© girl
In the hack, they drove to a brook In thd
%'icinity. where they took her oat of the
hack again and bathed her face. They put
her back Into the hack and drove to Dr.
Wiley's office, and as he was not at homa
they hurried to Dr. Townsend's house.
Disposing of the Body.
Continuing. McAllster said:
"It was our Intention to act on thÂ« sug
gestion of the hackman at first and driva
to the girl's home. We purposed to leave
the dead body on the front stoop of tho
Bosschleter home, but there were so

attack was aimed la Dr. O. L. Elliott,
acting registrar of the university. An
article written by Dr. Elliott and printed
in the December number of the college
literary magazine. "The Sequoia," was
the cause of the criticism in "The Chap
arral." The student who la responsible
for the articles Is Brlstow Adams, editor
of the "Chaparral." So Justifiable doe^
he consider the articles that he has
shouldered the responsibility and seems
ready to take any consequences that may
follow.
Dr. Elliott's article which caused tha
criticism is referred to as "a recent out
burst" by Adams. It was entitled. "How
Can Alma Mater Wean Her Babies?" In
It Dr. Elliott handled both alumni and
undergraduates without gloves.
Adams in his reply takes the side of
the students and his thrust3 are as sharp
as those from the registrar. The larger
part of the current edition Is given up
to the task of chastisement. First he
treats of the article In his editorial col
umns: next the biting- sarcasm of "Mr.
Tooley" Is brought to bear: lastly anil
at more length he takes up the original
article point by point and makes vigorous
comment.
Replying to the question. "How Can
Stanford Wean Her Babies?" the article
says :
We would suggest that she treat them a lit
tle less as If they were in a kindergarten and
more as if they were men and women of a
great university. Let Alma Mater's children
have a few grown-up privileges and see if tha
result will not be more satisfactory than that
obtained from putting a puerile protest on
payer.
Both faculty and students are taking
sides, and "Chaparrals" are above par
on the market. It remains to be seen
whether or not Editor Adams will be
taken to task for his criticism of a pub
lished article from a member of the fac
ulty.
sion promises to be stormy, as the stu
dents are divided In a measure against
themselves. .A; proposition Is on foot to
memorialize Mrs. Stanford and beg her
to. reinstate .Professor Howard. âIn- this
proposition the students" appear to â¢ have
missed the very point of the entire affair.
Rumors have been circulated that I;i this
serious emergency In the life of Stanford
University President Jordan has shirked
his duty and has gone into hiding. Noth
ing, it appears, could be further from the
truth. Those who represent President
Jordan here give every assurance that he
not only accepts sole responsibility for
everything which has been done, but he
insists. that his policy, which he believes
to be the best for the university, shall be
followed. Dr. Jordan has been under a
severe stress since his return from Japan.
His domestic bereavement, the Ross Inci
dent and the Howard affair have contrib
uted to disturb him seriously, and for a
few days he has been taking a needed
rest at San Luis Obispo. He will return,
however, to-morrow and assume personal
charge of university affairs^
It is the opinion here to-night that the
excitement resulting from the whole af
fair will subside at once.
ATTACKS THE REGISTRAR.
Article in a Student Magazine Creates
a Furor.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan. 16.-
College circles were aroused by the stu
dent criticism of a member of the fac
ulty which appeared this morning in "The
Chaparral.", a comic magazine published
by an association of Stanford students.
It has been well known for several days
that some sort of criticism was to ap
pear In to-day's Issue of the magazine,
but it was not believed that the context
would be so harsh .nor the reproof so
smirching.
The person at whom the brunt of the
5TANT0RD UNIVERSITY.
Jan. 16. â The college town is
deeply agitated over the la
test developments In the un
fortunate affair that, has al
ready taken five professors
from the university and
threatens to provoke a climax that may
be of the moFt serious consequence to
this great educational Institution. A
feflir.g cf uncertainty and unrest per
vades the student body, and even ths
most conservative members of the fac
ulty are candidly apprehensive. They
ere concerned deeply over the future of
Stanford. They believe that the univer
sity is parsing through a critical ordeal
er.d only calmne?s. Judgment and cool
discretion will carry it through without
Injury to everything -which is of material
value to it.
Sensation followed sensation to-day,
when David Ellsworth Spencer, associate
professcr of history, accepted the lead of
Professor Howard and resigned. Profes-
H r Spencer has made Howard's cause his
own and has withdrawn pimply to show
a spirit of sympathy and friendliness to
a persona! friend. Professor Spencer
Fays that he feels that Professor Howard
Â¦w;is not fairly treated, and in justice to
himself and his friend ho was compelled
to wi.hdraw. No other significance is at
tached to the resignation, Â¦which was Im
mediately accepted by Acting President
Brar.r.er.
Filling the Vacancies.
The university authorities are already
preparing to fill the vacancies caused by
the several resignations. Profr-ssor Laps
ley of Harvard, a capable and scholarly
man, has been appointed to a chair in th*
university and will take two of Professor
Howard' r classes In constitutional and
American history. It is possible that the
course of the French Revolution may >>e
dropped. Late this evening President
J. C. Eranner telegraphed to engage an-
other professor from Columbia College.
A reply Is expected to-morrow. There Is
no question that the vacancies will be
easily and quickly filled and that no
harm in the standard of the various de
partments affected will result. The In-
Jury. If any there be, will be altogether
In a different direction.
Miss Lucille Eaves, one of the Instruct
ors 1- the department of history, created
something' of a stir this morning by a
somewhat daring address to her stu
dents. She expressed sympathy for Pra
fessor Howard and declared that If it
were not for her class and the Interests
of her students she also would resign.
It Is reasonably certain that she will be
called to task by the university authori
ties for a violation of discipline.
President Jordan's Supporters.
Whatever may be said of the merits of
the controversy which has sent five pro
fessors of Stanford Into other fields In
vestigation develops one factâ the gentle
men who have retired do not seem to have
; either the sympathy or the support of the
| influential and conservative members cf
j the faculty. The men who have contrib-
I uted most to the success of the g--at ed
ucational Institution, who have clothed It
I with its character and have given to It
its dignity, are practically a unit in sup
1 porting President Jordan and his action.
| There are, perhaps, only two members of
the faculty of Stanford University who
are rot in accord with Dr. Jordan and
against Professor Howard and the friends
who have gone with him into voluntary
exile. One of these men who expresses
sympathy for Professor Howard and crit
j icizes the conduct of President Jordan
is Arthur O. Lovejoy, associate professor
of philosophy. Professor Lovejoy has
made no public comment, but has coa
tented himself with Â»ome rather caustic
remarks privately to lriends. The atmos
phere of goeslp Is electric, however, and

OF DRS. ROSS AND HOWARD AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Walden Is a native of Germany and In

a term of twenty years* imprisonment

my opinion that they were sold for half
what they were really worth from the
fact that whoever bought them must have
been a partner In the crime.
Trying to Find Accomplices.
"Whether Walden was known to be a
criminal and was tempted Is also another
thing which needs consideration. I think
that "Walden thought that on account of
the death of Chief Clerk Ellis he could
steal anything In reason and never ba
detected In hi* robbery. Walden never
handled any of the money, but it is im
possible to tell how often he shipped
sacks to the city In the same manner
In Â¦which he has been detected on these
two occasions.
"I consider that Walden has treated us
Â¦with Ingratitude and no stone -will be left
unturned to bring him to Justice. Up to
the present time we have no trace of his
â¢whereabouts. He might have been swal
lowed up by the* earth, so cleverly has
he hidden his tracks. We hope to
be able to trace the drays and teamsters
who ' hauled the loads away from the
Jackson-street wharf, and you can rest
assured that when we find who bought
the sacks we will give the people a sen
sation. I am under the opinion now
that this thing has been going on for
some time and my brother Prison Direc
tors and myself will probe It to the bot
tom.
"If Walden is caught he will be severely
dealt with. I am sorry that the matter has
become public, as we hoped to keep the
whole thing a secret until we had located
the parties who bought the sacks, but
that Is a minor matter. They can be eas
ily found."
"When Walden asked for a week's holi
day he was granted a vacation willingly,
but when we heard of his two conflicting
stories about the nature of his trip we
became suspicious. We found that he
shipped over fifty thousand sacks to the
"city to a confederate and charged the
same to Miller & Lux and th,e Southern
Milling Company, our two biggest cus
tomers. These sacks are worth J2S00, but
I suppose that Walden or his confederate
sold them to some party or parties In San
Prison Director J. M. Wilkins was inter

to Walden's embezzlement. He was reti

that he would prefer not to talk about

frustrate the plans for the recovery of
the stolen sacks. When told, however,
that The Call had full information of
Walden's crime he made the following
statement:

to all outward appearances the man led a
model life*. He never asked for a holiday,
was never known to drink, had no vices,
and his only recreation when away from
the mill was to occasionally visit Schuet
zen Park and participate in the shooting
matches. It Is now thought that the man
was not as Innocent as he appeared, and
that the amount of his embezzlement will
never be known. His books were kept by
a system of his own, and it Is now
thought that he was so confident he would
not be discovered in his crime that he
shipped sacks to the city. when and to
whom he pleased. The experts claim that
they have already found several instances
where TValden forced a balance.

to whom they were consigned. Walden
kept his books in such a manner that the
experts found that the only way that
they could detect any embezzlement
would be to ascertain If all the buyers
charged -with sacks had received their
consignments. Miller & Lux and the
Southern Milling Company, two of the
largest purchasers, were asked if they
had received a shipment of 25,000 sacks

Similar resolutions were adopted to-day
bv the Merchants' and Manufacturers'
Association and the -following: dispatch
â¢was sent by Its secretary to members of
the southern delegation:
There Is no Becewlty for immediate action
Senator Rowell called upon the Gover
nor during the morning and discussed
with him the measures already intro
duced. They are the result of conferences
among the Regents, the alumni and the
friends of the university. Senator Rowell
was satisfied with the result of the dis
cussion, and he believes there will be no
trouble in formulating measures that will
suit every one. .
The fate of the university measures so
far as the Assembly in general is con
cerned is in abeyance, pending the ap
pointment of a member to succeed Ber
nard Collins, the deceased Assemblyman
from Butte, on the special committee ap
pointed to consider the portions of the
Governor's message relating to Stanford
and the State University.
The GÂ«vernor reasserted his desire to
see the act appropriating- the 2 per cent
direct tax amended and the $50,000 in the
Governor's mansion fund transferred to
the university maintenance fund. The
audience lasted three-quarters of an hour.
"Let it be $100,000 or $200,000. as its needs
may determine," he said, "even if the
cost to the State per student is greater
than in Eastern universities. We are
Californians and believe in supporting our
institutions with California liberalty."
In rezard to the matter of control by
the State Board of Examiners, Senator
I.ukens said that the Regents published
regularly complete financial statements
and reports of their management.
"Yes; but who ever sees those reports?"
apkÂ»d the Governor.
"As many as examine any official re
ports." was the retort.
Leavitt was more conciliatory in tone
than Lukens. and in response to his in
quiry Governor Gage said he would be
frlad to see a direct appropriation made
for as large a sum as the university need
ed for its liberal support.
Xo one took up the cudgel and the Gov
ernor proceeded:
"When the university people asked for
the 2 per cent direct tax we were assured
that they would ask no more. Now they
are clamoring- for increased revenue. The
institution already costs more than many
larger Eastern universities, and I have
ligures to prove it. The claim for in
creased revenue is not well founded. I
doubt if in the next ten years there will
be any considerable increase in the num
ber of students enrolled."
GOVERNOR VERSUS
THE UNIVERSITY
States His Position, and Bills
Will Be Altered Accordingly.
Special IMepatcn. to The CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 36.â The Alameda
Cnunty delegation had an audience
with Governor Gage at 3 o'clock
this afternoon, with the result
that a new set of bills relating to revenue
for the University of California probably
will be introduced. The Governor took
nn unequivocal stand against the Rowell
Mil and the majority of the delegation be
lieves that the Assembly will refuse to
pass measures of that character against
the Governor's wishes, much less to force
Them through over his veto. Under the
drcuniFlances the Alamedans believe the
or.ly wise course is to introduce measures
Â¦tthirh will receive the approbation of
Governor Gage. and. in consequence of
his purport, obt&in Eome benefit for the
Â¦university, Â«vcn though it be thoroughly
riiRappointirig to the alumni and friends of
that institution. ,
The bi!!s that probably will be FUbstl
t uted are one making a -direct appropria
tion of EM.OOO for maintenance during the
fueceeding two fiscal years, one amend
ing the act by which 50 per cent of the
T per cent tax must be devoted to perma
nent improvements by making all of it
available for maintenance, and a third
transferring the fund of .$50,000 appro
priated for a Governor's mansion to the
jralntensnce fund of the university.
The Alameda delegation did not caucus
pfier the audience with .the Governor. A
meetins Trill be called by Senator Taylor,
< hairman of the delegation, probably to
irorrow, at which a definite decision will
1-e reached in regard" to the substitute
measures and agreement reached as to
Â¦who phall draft and introduce them.
The conference with Governor Gage was
the result of an intimation that the Gov
ernor gave Senator Loavitt that he would
't>f clad to meet the deJegaion from Ala
rneda County to consider the interests of
â¢the university. Leavitt got the delega
tion' together last night and volunteered
to arrange for an audience. with the Gov
ernor to-day. He did eo and at 3 o'clock
all cf the Alameda Senators and Assem-
Mymea except Koliy, who had not been
informed of the hour of the conference,
went together to the Governor's office.
Governor Gage went to the heart of the
problem at once. He reiterated Â¦ the op-
I'^sition he had expressed in his message
-,n the methods of indirect taxation pro
jiosed In Senator RowelL's bills. He ppoke
i\ilh considerable feelinfr. particularly in
opposition to the inheritance tax meas
ure. Continuing, he said he desired to
tee the university put on the same basis
as other State institutionsâ supported by
direct biennial appropriations and its af
3'airs to be subject to the scrutiny of the
Ftate Board of Examiners. Senator Lu
kens gave the objection to this plan, pay
ing that direct appropriations would force
the university people to resort to a lobby
every two years.
"They are jamming and lobbying all
the lime as it is," replied the Governor.
"They are about the worst with which
wÂ« have to deal."
Seantor Lukcns Fald further that the
Governor's plan would leave the universi
ty's future insecure, endangered by the
jiogsibility of a Legislature antagonistic
lo adequate support of it.
"This is a government of the people."
the Governor said, "and if they choose to
lake such a position it Is not our duty to
iilac* the accomplishment of their wish
j'pvor.d thfir reach."
In illustration of what he evidently re
pards as careless financial management,
Governor Gage referred to the case of a
1 rofeFFor who lately spent a year in Eu
j-opiÂ» on full pay. Lukens contended that
t-uch xvaF the custom with universities to
encourage research. Stanford allows its
professors one year in every seven for
Â«uch research, on leave of absence with
full pay.
"Do you know how many days the pres-
Ident of the University of California has
l.pfn iireiÂ»<un at the university since his
inauguration?" retorted the Governor.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 16.â Members of the Legis
lature who have given to the subject of
rules close study assert that the rule
adopted . yesterday, .relating to free con
ference, must be amended because it del
egates legislative powers to a commit
tee and Is therefore unconstitutional: Ac
cording to the joint rule in ; question,.fail
ure of the Â¦ free conference < to agree sde
cides the fate of the bill. This practical-*
ly gives to three, or four members of the
committee the . power Â¦ -. to a defeat a bill
which both r houses have passed. The ob
ject; of the conference is to promote and
not to kill legislation. â¢ Â¦ r
4 Suppose that the ,' primary election . law
should get , into -free v conference by - tho
manipulation' of the bosses, and that one
of Boss Kelly's agents on the floor should
whisper, to the presiding officer, "Put % so
and so on the conference."; In the rush of
legislation; the presiding officer, might an
announce : the conf < rr>nce % committee *â' as
requested. Agentr, of the. bosses would
bring about; a disagreement, and, accord

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 16.â The Senate Apportion
ment Committee met this morning, but
proceeded no further than organization
and a determination to meet often. The
Congressional districts were discussed,
but - no action upon them can be taken
until Congress shall . have decided, how
many of them there will be; consequently
the work of the committee for some time
yet will be somewhat speculative.
There has been one idea advanced, how
ever, which is new, and in carrying it out
the vexed question of making the Demo
cratic Sixth District a Republican dis
trict will have been solved. The plan is
to make of San Francisco two Congres
sional districts, the Fourth and the Fifth.
The city has a population of 842.7S2. which
would leave for each district 171,391, or
as much as either the Seventh or Eighth
districts will have under the present
scheme.
This would allow San Mateo. Santa I
Cruz and Santa Clara to go Into the Sixth
District, which would make it certainly
Republican.
The proposition has been broached to
the San Francisco delegation and It has
met their favor. They would be glad to
have the city by itself and free from the
county rights, and the counties would be
as glad to be free of the city.
Senator Lardrfer has a proposition to
make one Senatorial district out of Placer,
County, leaving out El D6rado. but the
problem of what to do with E.1 Dorado
under the circumstances makes the suc
cess of the scheme doubtful.

SUSPICIOUS OF
THE BRADY BILL
Telephone Manager Glass
Says It's a Cinch
Measure.
"That's the dncher," said the push after
reading The Call synopsis of Assembly
man "Colonel" Brady's bill for the regula
tion of telephone rates.
At headquarters of the telephone sys
tem it is suspected that Martin Kelly and
Sam Rainey had a hand in the prepara
tion of the proposed cinch. It is a signifi
cant fact that the managers of the Sunset
corporation were advised by a lawyer
some weeks ago that an attorney hail
been engaged to draw up a regulating
bill. Since the first day of the legislative
session the lobby strikers at Sacramento
have been talking about the determina
tion of the Legislature to put a stop to
the extortion of the telephone company.
The hints and suggestions apparently
had no effect on the managers of the cor
poration. They did not advise any one
to withhold the bill or submit its pro
visions to their attorneys, but went right
along collecting the long distance dollar
and the urban nickel just as If the Legis
lature was not in session.
Louis Glass, general manager of the Pa
cific Telephone and Telegraph Companv
ana the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph
Company, asserts that the companies with
which he is connected will not contribute
one dollar toward defeating the bill in
troduced by Assemblyman Brady.
"I do not know," remarked Mr. Glass
yesterday, "that the bill was introduced
In the Legislature to cinch our company
but I suspect that it was. and I believe
that two bosses in San Francisco, one a
Democrat uu the other a Republican
knew that a measure of this kind was i:i
contemplation.
"So far aa our company is concerned,"
continued Mr. Glass, "we ihall rely on
the fair dealing of the Legislature. We
are not at the mercy of the San Francisco
delegation. We have- friends in every
county and business interests throughout
the State. You can say in The Call that
the company will not pay one dollar to
defeat cinch legislation."

Demise.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 16.â The Assembly ad
journed this morning without the trans
action of any business as a mark of re
spect to the memory of Bernard Collins,
Assemblyman from Butte, who died yes
terday of pneumonia.
A great bouquet of roses tied with crapa
adorned the desk of the deceased mem
ber when the Assembly was called to or
der. Rollcall began and when Cler*
Lloyd called "Collins ot Butte" Johnson
arose and said:
"Our friend and associate has been
called to answer the roll in the house not
made by hands, in that undiscovered
country from whose bourne no traveler
returns, and he Is to-day in the presence
of his Maker to answer to him for his
deeds here on earth.
"For twenty-one years I had known Mr.
Collins and In every relation of life, a3
friend, neighbor, citizen, loving husband
and father, I know that, he bore Jiimself
in an irreproachable manner. Here in the
Assembly we had not had time to come
to a just appreciation of his high charac
ter, his great intellect and indomitable
will. I do not hesitate to say that ha-i
he been spared he would- have made an
honorable record here and would after
ward have been called , to positions of
greater honor and trust by the people
of Butte County.
Â¦ "It is my painful duty to announce the
death of our friend, >ui associate. Hon,
B. Collins of Butte and to request that
the Assembly now adjourn out of respect
to his memory."
Rutherford offered a resolution calling
for the appointment of five members from
the Assembly to act with five member*
from the Senate as a joint committee on
resolutions in memory of the deceased
member and Schillig offered one for the
appointment of three members to act
with two from the Senate as a joint com
mittee of five on funeral arrangements.
Both were adopted ani on a resolution of
fered by Alelick. the Assembly adjourned.
Speaker Pendleton apoointed for the

Dunlap, McNeil, Higby and Cowan, and
for the committee on funeral arrange
ments Schillig, Johnson and Schlesinger.

Assembly Corporations Committee Reconsiders
Its Action in Reporting Measure Favorably,,
The fight against hhe bill will be en
gineered by the Traction Company of Los
Angeles and the Salt Lake Company. Be
hind the Salt Lake Company is Senator
Clark of Montana, who has had experi
ence in close legislation, and with those
powers arrayed against the Southern Pa
cific the fight promises to be an interest
ing one.
The franchise fight in Los Angeles is an
old one. For several years the Traction
Company has been trying to obtain vari
ous franchises in several parts of Los
Angeles, but each attempt has been
blocked. The matter was. finally made an
issue in the last campaign, with the re
sult that a council uninfluenced by the
Southern Pacific was put in and the Trac
tion Company made another application
for several franchises it wanted. The
franchises asked. for provide for the car
rying of all passengers over the Traction
lines, which means that if any but the
Traction Company obtains the privilege
it will force a transfer system. The rea
son for this, it is alleged, is that the local
railway system is such that to grant
franchises to any company that would
refuse to do business with the Traction
Company would not serve the people of
the localities sought to be benefited. Such
a provision is not included in the bills
Introduced, and the Los Angeles people
desire to have it added.
It is urged, too, that under the pro
visions relating to gross receipts it would
be possible for a road to bid a higher per
centage of the gross receipts, build but
a portion of the road and surrender the
remainder of the franchise by a consent
which is not always hard to obtain.
There is another bill, drawn by those
opposing the present measures, which will
be introduced within a few days and there
ere a number of amendments which the
opponents of the present bills will bring
with them from the south in the hope of
having them grafted upon the subject of
the whole controversy.
GALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 16.â The fight is on
over the franchise bill introduced
in the Senate by Senator Simpson
and in the Assembly by Mr
Broughton of Los Angeles. The Assem
bly bill was referred to the Committee on
Municipal Corporations and yesterday it
was reported upon favorably by that com
mittee. There has been a hitch, however,
and now the matter has been reopened
by the committee, the favorable report
has been set aside for a time and the
bill will be considered in committee again.
The delay has come from the opponents
of the bill in. the south, who have" kept
the wires hot with messages and the
mails full of letters asking, ordering and
demanding delay until they can reach
here and be heard. The -consideration of
the' bill has been &et for Monday next
and at that time an "open fight "will begin.
.The bill is a measure to regulate- the
sale of franchises and their, advertise
ment, to define the term "gross receipts,"
and to provide for a system by â¢ which
seekers after franchises may bid against
the highest bidder after the sealed bids
shall have been opened, it places the ad
vertisement of franchises at the option
of the City Council. The opponents of
the bill declare it should be left as nowâ
to the people. It dennes the gross receipts
of a branch system as that proportion of
the receipts which bears the same rela
tion to the whole as does the size of the
branch to the size of the system. The
opponents declare that a ten-mile branch
In a 1000-mile system may earn three
fourths of the receipts, and yet under
the bill be credited with but one-tenth of
them. And as for allowing bids against
the highest sealed bid. they claim it will
simply allow the company with most
money to carry away the prize.

The SJanta Clara dlvlsidists maintain
silence, but their approval of the bill is
an open secret. The measure is the one
scheme which will rlace Â« the disposal
of cunning manipulators easy and inex

purposes. If the bill shall become a law
there remains for them oaly the necessity
of convincing a few scattered ranchers
that a new county of tholr own will po9

and county control come within the grasp
of the schemers. .
As yet there Is no money In the right,
but all interested are .ilwaltin* with In
terest the action of Hilary Miller. It is
asserted that he stands' ready to supply
money to any amount necessary to se
cure the division of Santa Clara County-
The Inference arrived at here Is that the
Schillig bill *uit 3 the purposes of Miller
and Rea so well that they are content" to
wait until its fate be decided.
Assemblyman Sehllllg; asserted to-day
that he Introduced the measure because
he believed It to be a desirable one.
"The constitution." he said. "Rives thÂ»
Legislature the power to enact such a
general law and I believe that power
should be exercised. Any one who re
members the scandals attendant upon th<Â»
division of San Bernardino, Kings and
Glenn counties will agree that the present
method i3 most objectionable. It is true
Broughton asked ma to Introduce the bill,
but I consented solely because I have Ionic
considered a general law providing a.
method of county division desirable."
Broughton denies that the bill was
passed up to him before he turned It over
to Schillig. He says: "Ten years ago I
was up here as a member of the 'third
house* and we succeeded in getting such
a bill through tho Assembly, but they
killed It In the Senate. I have believed
since then that an act of this kind shouid
become a law.
"Why did I turn it over to Mr. Schillig?
Well, the eastern end of my district, with
Pomona as a center, wants division. . The
western end. near Los Angeles, opposes it.
I don't know wheie I stand and didn't
care to father this bill. I figured that
Schlllig came from two such small coun
tiesâTuba and Sutlerâ that no one couKl
accuse him of having a county division
scheme up his sleeve, so I gave him the
bill and he thought It a good one and
readily consented to introduce It."
Broughton admitted that he had talker]
to other Assemblymen about the bill, but
refused to give their names, claiming it
would be a breach of confidence. Ho
denied that any one Interested In Santa
Clara division had talked with him or
that any One had suggested that he get
Schillig to Introduce the bill.

HENRY WATTEBSON PLEADS
FOR ACCEPTANCE OF TREATY
Perkins explained fully to the commit
tee what he partly explained last week,
that Just as this treaty was being nego
tiated Jamaican tariffs were Increased so
that when reductions were figured under
the treaty it was found there had been
no actual reduction. Perkins also referred
to another Important point In connection
with these reciprocity treaties. They were
negcfclated supposedly under section 4 of
the Dlngley bill, which made provision
for them and which stipulated that they
be negotiated within two years from the
passage of that bill.
Senator Perkins claimed that as these
two years have long since expired there
is no authority for negotiating such
treaties. Inasmuch as they affect the
country's revenues, and If the system
were carried out far enough the entire
customs tariffs might be determined by
the treaty-making power, irrespective of
the House representatives. In replying to
Senator Perkins Mr. Kasson attempted to
read the Californians out of the Republi
can party by contending- that the Repub-'
llcan party Â¦was entirely committed: by
the plank in the last national 'platform
and by the last message Â¦ from President
McKinley to the policy of reciprocity.
Senator Perkins said- In substance: Â»*
"In considering the proposed treaty my
first objections- to it , were based on the
fact that the tariff which it was proposed
to establish would work great injury to
American producers of sugar and citrus
fruits, pineapples and vegetables .with
which products importations from Jamai
ca would come into immediate and direct
competition. It is unquestionable that the
negro labor of Jamaica could and would.
If opportunity were furnished by remov-
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â The Cali
fornia Congressional delegation had an
other hearing to-day before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee on the
Jamaican reciprocity treaty. Special
Commissioner Kasson, of the State De
partment, was present In support of the
treaty. Senator Perkins acted as spokes
man for California and got into a tilt
with Mr. Kasson over some of the pecu
liarities of this treaty, asking' Mr. Kas
son if he had given England a tip so that
she increased her tariffs just at the right
moment. Kasson indignantly denied this.
"Two millions of dollars Invested in
orange orchards, beet sugar mills, pineries
and truck gardens in California and the
South would have their profits practically
extinguished. California would . be the
greatest sufferer, as the present tariff on
citrus fruits Is fixed at a figure which
simply offsets the excess In the cost of
rail carriage across the continent wher
compared with tho importations from tlrV
tropics. "The effect of the reduction pro
posed by the treaty would be to shut the
Eastern market Â¦ against -: the , California
raisers of citrus fruits. That interest
alone is too great for Congress to permit
it -to be Injured, certainly unless some
very great and general benefit can be se
cured in return,: ln_ which benefit the-in
jured interest can share, v In studying the
proposed treaty in ; connection with the
former , Jamaican ; tariffs, . I have been
forced to the conclusion that, the treaty
should be rejected Â» on ". the general Â¦ ground
that it confers practically no benefits to
this country in return for , very great re
ductions in tariff "on the most Important
exports of Jamaica.'' x The .-first- point
which appears in the study, of tho ques
tion is that, since the passage ', of the
tariff act providing < for- reciprocity,, two
new ;". tariffs have been promulgated : in
Jamaica,- each successively . increasing- thÂ»
duty on American goods Into thats island"
"While three very important' Industries
of the United States' are thrown open -to
the disastrous competition.: our own * pro

years ago. I assert that .the ratification
of the proposed treaty would be contrary

PHYSICAL ailments attendant on
ege and financial difficulties re
sultant upon the panic of 1S93
have finally led to the unbalanc
ing of the mind of Mrs. Henrietta
R. Howell of Chicago, whose mania for
parading the corridors of the Palace Hotel
nightly en dishabille forced the manage
ment of that hostelry to request her to
leave Tuesday afternoon, and she was
yesterday incarcerated in the detention
ward of the Receiving Hospital at the
City Hall. Mrs. Howell, who had been a
guest of the Palace since October, had
been acting queerly for some time. Her
vagaries took a religious form recently
and she imagined that she was "pursuing
the light"
After having been notified by the man
agement to leave she went to the Golden
West Hotel, remained there, over night
and early yesterday morning took up a
position between the car tracks at Powell
and O'Farrell streets. She was in very
scanty attire and braved the chilly morn-
Ing air until Patrolmen Kissane and
North removed her to the City Hall. She
was very violent when arrested, and Ma
tron Swett had considerable difficulty In
controlling her. After remaining in the
hospital until about 8 o'clock friends took
her to a private sanitarium, where she
will be kept until her mind is restored to
its normal condition.
Mrs. Howell is the possessor of a .for

forty or fifty lumber yards were under his
control. Then came the slump and How
ell's fortune went by the board. His wife
came to the rescue and saved what she
could from the wreck,' and then turned to
California to recoup their fortunes.
Becoming interested in a mining . com
pany in Angels Camp, known as the
Bolither Mining Company, all available
money was placed in the venture. Legal
complications followed, delays were nu
merous and Mrs. Howell finally came to
the coast to personally direct affairs. Uporr
her the relatives and friends had settled
an Independent fortune. This she threw
into the breach and sought by every
means in her power to open up a new
Utlca. In Chicago she was noted for her
charities; she pursued the same plan here,
and then came the physical ailments that
dethroned her reason. She resided for a
time at 301 Polk street, and from thero
went to the Palace Hotel. When arrested
Mrs. Howell had nearly $2000 in- diamonds
and Jewelry and some $80 in coin on her
person.
As a result of the woman's pitiful con
dition Assistant United States District
Attorney Edward J. Banning, who is in

guardianship and will take charge of her
affairs and person until her mother ar

point of danger.
"They -were hazed to a degree," said
Money, with deep feeling, "that would
have warranted the hazee in killing the
hazers." :
"They ought to have been killed," inter
jected Allen. Â¦ - ,Â¦
"And I want to say," continued Money,
"that if I were a cadet at West Point and
was hazed in so cowardly . and brutal a
manner' I- would kill 1 he hazers; if the op
portunity did noy come for a hundred
years afterward."'* . - :
Continuing his discussion of the action
of the cadets at West Point. Allen said: â¢
"These cadets carr^ hazing to the extent
of taking life, and in one Instance recently
they have taken life, and the Senator from
Mississippi (Money) says they have taken
life in several instances."
"This brutal outrage ought to be sup
pressed and it can be suppressed. Boy or
man, he who will use his superior strength
in humiliating or brutally/ treating a
weaker person is a coward. And yet this
bill encourages and supports West Point
as at present conducted. --^-v
"With authority I would stop that bru
tality at West Point," declared Allen, "or
I would dismantle the school and turn
over to the various States the education
of the youth of the country for military
purposes. I have Information which leads
me to believe that hazing at West Point
is resorted to for the purpose of forcing
out of the institution cadets appointed
from civil life In order to make room for
the sons of army officers. And if they
cannot force out the cadet by humiliation
and intimidation they ' prescribe a course
of examination which is in their own
hands and which they could not pass
themselves, and thus force the proscribed
cadet from the school." , â¢
"And these things,"" shouted Allen,
"take place with the knowledge of the
officers of the Institution. These new
cadets are compelled to eat soap, they are
compelled to get down on their knees and
Jump like a trog and they are compelled
to endure other indignities. which 1 would
not dare In this presence to mention. Some
of the regular army officers say hazing
cannot be Â¦ helped â that It capnot be pre
vented. You place one of the old volun
teer officers at the head of that Institu
tion and in six weeks he will put a stop
to it or there will be some dead cadets
there. â¢
i After a . brief review of the Booz case
Allen declared that the first thing a fourth
class man meets at West Point Is. brutal
assault and humiliating indignity.
"This thing -called hazingâprize-fight
ing," exclaimed Allen, â¢ "why, .the prize
fighter Is a gentleman compared with
some of those young ruffians at West
Point. Indeed, life has 'been lost re
cently."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â Congress Is
beginning to take ; an active Interest In
hazing at West Point. In tho Senate,
while the army reorganization bill was
under, consideration^, to-day, Allen of Ne
braska discussed vigorously the situation
at West Point as brought out by, the pend
ing Investigation. Hedeclared that bru
tality had been developed at West Point
which ought not to be expected to exist
among barbarians:

cers to Bar Ouf

A WELCOME CALLER.
.With our children we think there is
nothing so safe and â¢ reliable as Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets to ward off croup and
colds, and with older people I have known
of cases where the hearing had been se-
riously impaired by chronic catarrh cured
entirely by this new remedy. v
Mr." A. R. Fernbank of Columbus, Ohio,
says: I suffered so many winters from
Catarrh that I took It a? a matter of
course; and that nothing would cure It
except a change of climate, which my
business affairs would not permit me to
take. .
My nostrils were almost always clogged
up. I had to breathe through the mouth.
causing an Inflamed, irritated throat. The
thought of eating breakfast often nause-
ated me, and the catarrh gradually get-
ting Into my stomach took away my ap-
petite and digestion.
My druggist advised me to try, a 50-cent
box of Stuart'3 Catarrh Tablets, because
he said he had so many customers who
had been cured of Catarrh by .the use of.
these tablets that he felt he could honest-
ly recommend them. I took his advice
and. used several boxes, with results that
surprised and delighted me.
Â¦ I always keep a box of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets in the house,' and the whole fam-
ily use them freely on the first appearance'
of a cough or cold In the head.
These tablets, which are pleasant and
harmless to take, owe their efficiency to
the' active medicinal Â¦ principles of Blood
Root. Red Gum and a new specific called
Gualacol, which, together with valuable
antiseptics, are combined in convenient,
palatable tablet form and as valuable for
children a* for adults.
Anew discovery which Is meeting with
remarkable success in curing catarrh of
the head, throat and bronchial tubes, and
also catarrh of the stomach, is sold by
druggists under name of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets.
Catarrh may be readily cured in any cli-
mate, but the only way to do it Is to de-
stroy or remove from the system the ca-
tarrhal germs which cause all the mis-
chief.
The treatment by inhalers, sprays, pow-
ders and washes has been proven almost
useless in making a permanent cure, as
they do not reach the seat . of disease,
which is in the blood and can be reached
only ' by an internal remedy, which acts
through the stomach upon the blood and
system generally. i-
Not Necessary in Order to Cure
Catarrh.
The popular idea that the only cure for
chronic catarrh is a change of climate is a
mistake, because catarrh i3 found In all
climates in all sections of the country,
and even if a change of climate should
benefit for a time, the catarrh will cer-
tainly return.

SÂ»ecJ*l Dlsirateii to The OJ1
jf^ ORON'ADO, Jan. 16.â This was the
n third day of the Pacific Coast
II. Field Trials and the first of the
all-age stake, which was only par-
tiaily completed. There was a
heavy fogr hanging over the island when
the first brace went down this morning
and the bushes were dripping with wa
ter. The fog lifted about 10:30, but there
Â¦were clouds overhead and the air was
<Tuite oppressive. The work of the dogs
was not as good as was expected in the
all-age class, and there were no particu
larly brilliant heats run during the day.
Cuba Zpp did a piece of very good work
in the last heat, but aside from that noth
ing approaching brilliancy took place.
Clipper \V, who put up such a fine run
yesterday, ran an exceedingly poor heat
in the bye and his performance was abso
lutely without merit- That he was out
of condition was apparent to all, and in
stead of the speed and dash exhibited on
other occasions he ran with a low head
and seemed in distress throughout the en
tire heat. Messrs. Johnson, Post and Schu
macher again acted as judges. It was ful
ly expected that the all-age stake would
Â£>e finished Â¦ to-day, and it appears that
It might easily have been brought to a
conclusion had work been continued In
stead of calling up the dogs and starting
for home shortly after 4 o'clock. The run
r.lr.g was as follows:
Cuba of Ker.wood-Blazeaway â This was
the first brace of the day and they went
down at 1:2. A long cast was made be
fore birds were found, when Cuba secured
a bevy point in short sage. The birds
flushed to hÂ»avy cover, where Cuba again
pointed and was steady to shot.
Verona Cash-Pride of Rossâ Upon being
cast off both dogs disappeared In the fog
and Pride soon returned to his handler,
but Verona remained away. After travel
ing come distance a halt was called while
a search was made for the dog, but this
â¢was of no avail, nor was she found until
pome two hours later. Another brace was
substituted.
Lady-Merry Heartâ Lady's work was
riot as brilliant as that of yesterday, and
ehe was less certain on her points. She
made two or three points where no bird
â¢could be found, then pointed Btanchly
end was backed by Merry Heart. Upon
the bird being flushed Lady went on, but
Merry Heart moved up a few feet and

of the Tuff Congress held at the Welling

been in operation this season. It also
leaves out Little Rock and other Southern

made a very stylish point and was steady
to wing. Another point for Lady and a
back for Merry Heart, but again no bird.
Tacoma-Lady Rodschaffâ Tacoma Is a
handsome dog with splendid style, but
does not seem to understand California
quail, as his training has been on chickens
and pheasants. He made one point in the
heat, but no bird was found. Lady Rod
schaff went into the all age in bad condi
tion and showed at once that she was not
in form. She secured one stylish point, but
on the whole her work, was rather ragged.
Peach Blossom-Cuba Zep â Blossom se
cured a point then Zep located a running
bird, which he roaded by sight to a flush.
Another point for Blossom and a back
by Zep finished the heat.
Verona Cash-Pride of Rossâ This heat
was resumed after Cash had been found
and resulted in five points for Verona
Cash, but In both cases Pride refused to
back, and in the first Instance drew up
and took the point.
Clipper W-Byeâ Clipper was first put
down with a kennel mate and afterward
worked alone, but at no time did he show
any ambition, and several times he
evinced a disposition to return to the
teams. The Judges then announced that
the dogs which were eligible for the sec
ond series were Verona Cash, Cuba Zep,
Merry Heart, Cuba of Kenwood, Peach
Blossom and Lady.
Cuba-Ladyâ This heat still further dem
onstrated that Lady was not at her best,
as she pointed twice where no birds were
found, and In the third evinced a tendency
to chase where thÂ© bird was flushed. Cuba
followed suit within the next few min
utes and had no point to his credit when
the heat closed.
Peach Blossomâ Merry Heartâ This heat
resulted In a point for each, though very
few birds were found during the running.
Cuba Zep-Verona Cashâ Quite a distance
was covered before birds were found by
either of the does, and Verona was the
first to make fame. Once or twice she
appeared to be pointing:, but the birds
were running and flushed some distance
ahead Zep secured a point near the
edge of the field and ehowed by his man
ner that the birds were moving. His
trainer waved him on and he roaded
elowly to the edge of the field
and came to a point on - three
birds which were running through
the plowed ground. On being flushed,
Zep was sent off in another direction, but
made a cast and returned to where the
birds had dropped, and again came to a
point on a small bevy which ran out into
the field in plain sight of the crowd, and
remained there with the dog pointing un
til the handler was ordered to fire. After
a few minutes more running the doss
were ordered up.
The all age should be finished early to
morrow morning, which still leaves the

AUSTIN, Texas. Jan. 16.â Colonel L. J.

from Beaumont, where he visited the
great oil gusher. He says the discovery
Is unquestionably a world-beater and is
only the beginnings of many other equally
wonderful wells which will be found In
the same locality as rapidly as drilling
rigs can be shipped there and set to
work. Colonel Polk says the daily output
of the well at the most conservative esti
mate Is 15,000 barrels of oil and that many
reliable oil well experts who are on th.i
ground assert that the flow Is as great aa
25.000 barrels dally. There are three Joint
owners of the land UDon which the well
Is located and their ahare Is one-eighth
of all the oil produced' in this well or anv
others that may be drilled on the -land.
When Colonel Polk left Beaumont the oil
had formed a lake coveiing from fifty to
75 acres and many feet In depth. â¢ It Is" be
lieved that the waste of oil Is compara
tively small owing to the character of.th-i

SIGHTS WRECK
OF A SCHOONER
The plaintiffs claimed that the defend
ants discriminated against them In favor
of merchants doing business at San Fran
cisco by a joint tariff maintained by the
defendants between Portland and points
in Idaho and Utah on the line of the Short
Line Company; that this tariff operated
to discriminate in favor of San Francisco
merchants, because the rates prescribed
by It are the same as those charged under
a joint tariff made by the Southern Pacific
and the Short Line companies on freight
from San Francisco to these same Idaho
points, the distance from San Francisco
being much greater than from Portland.
It was further alleged that under a for
mer tariff a less rate was charged for
the greater distance to Ogden than that
charged to the intermediate points in
question. :;;;*Â¦
A demurrer to the complaint was sus
tained on the ground that the two lines,
that from Portland an'd that from San
Francisco, were competing lines, and that
the relation which the rate over one of
these lines bears to that over the other
is not subject to control by the courts,
and that the lower rate to Ogden could be
a matter of complaint only to the places
discriminated against, Portland being in
no way unreasonably affected thereby.

LABORING MEN
FOR COMMITTEE
Hundreds May Serve Among
Bishop Potter's 6000
Vigilantes.
Working People Declared Well Qual
ified to Take Up the Work of
Purification of New
York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 16.â If the present
plans of Bishop Potter are carried to a
successful culmination he will have estab
lished in a few days a vigilance commit
tee numbering 6000 persons, pledged and
sworn to learn of and correct evils in this
city. Speakine to a remarkable assem
blage of all men in all walks of life in St.
Paul's Chapel last November, Bishop Pot
ter advocated the formation of fjuch a
committee.
That the organization of a vigilance
committee was a concrete, thought In the
distinguished Bishop's mind was not con
sidered when he made that address on
"God and the City." However, It has
become known that Bishop Potter had
been quietly working to bring about such
a committee, each member of which will
labor individually for the good of the city
and the stamping out of places of iniqui
ty that have grown and been fostered by
police protection.
Those who will compose the vigilance
committee, It is expected, will be gath
ered from all ranks. It is well known
that Bishop Potter has personally felt
that too little attention has been given
to the fact that the labor organizations as
united bodies and worklngmen as indi
viduals have enlisted to assist In the
reformation of the city's evils. In the
vigilance committee now organizing there
will be hundreds' of laboring men, who,
better than any one else, know of the
overrunning of immorality In the far East
and West Side tenements, where the
homes of honest workingmen are found.
Bishop Potter said last night:
"No man is better qualified to take up
the work of purification than he who tolls
to support his wife and children. It was
in a realization of the value of the man
representing labor that when I was asked
for my advice about the formation of the
committee of fifteen I said, 'At all events,
let there be at least two representatives
of labor on the committee.' "

DETECTIVES WATCHING
FOR SIGMUND HERTZ
Confidential Clerk of a- New York Dry
Goods House Accused of
Embezzlement.
NEW YORK, Jan. 16.â The police de
partment announced to-day that the'man
to be arrested in Liverpool on a charge
of embezzlement is Sigmund Hertz, who
was employed as a confidential clerk by
Stiefel, Sachs & Co., wholesale dry goods
dealers. Hertz Is accused of robbing his
employees of a large sum of money by
means of forged checks. He took passage
on the steamer Corinthian under an as
sumed name on January 7 at Portland,
Me.
The English detectives have been fur
nished with a complete description of
Hertz and have been requested by Cap
tain of Detectives Titus to arrest and hold
him until requisition papers can be ob
tained. The checks, it is said, were prin
cipally passed on the Chemical National
Bank, where the firm kept its accounts.
The amount has been variously esti

Trans-Mississippi Cattlemen's Asso
. ciation May Soon Be Organ-
SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 16.â The dele
gates to the convention of the National
Livestock Association were slow In arriv
ing at the hall this morning and. before
proceeding to the regular business Presi
dent Springer read an anti-shoddy resolu
tion that was adopted by the executive
committee last night. The resolution calls
attention to the extensive use of cotton
and shoddy in what is put into so-called
"woolen goods" and calls the attention of
representatives in CongTess to the fact
and asks them to provide and enact such
legislation as will prevent fraud in mar
keting the manufactured article as wholly
of wool.
A committee was appointed to investi
gate these conditions and present them to
Congress. The resolution was adopted.
O. P. Updegraff of Kansas then deliv
ered an address on the "Benefits of Horse
Shows to the Horse Industry."
At the conclusion of Updegraff's ad
dress the Hon. George Q. Cannon of this
city, who has Just returned from a visit
to the Hawaiian Islands, addressed the
convention, his remarks relating chiefly to
the early history of Utah.
Mr. Baker of Illinois moved that the by
laws of the association be waived and that
the convention pay tribute to the memory
of the late Philip D. Armour and extend
to his widow and family the profound
sympathy of the convention- Unanimous
ly adopted. The Kansas City Livestock
Association has prepared a similar resolu
tion, which will be acted upon to-morrow.
At the afternoon session Mr. Stickney of
Wyoming offered a resolution to the effect
that a petition be sent to Washington for
the establishment of an additional signal
service in the Rocky Mountains.
Colonel John F. Hobbs of New York
spoke on "Oleomargarine vs. Dairy But
ter." Hobbs was followed by Hon. D. W.
Willson of Illinois with an address on
"The Buttered Side of the Question." At
the conclusion of Wlllson's address t he
convention adjourned until to-morrow.
To-nlpht the visitors were entertained
at the Tabernacle with an elaborate musi
cal programme, given by the famous Mor
mon Church Choir, consisting of 500
trained voices. .;.-<.
A large number of cattlemen have been
discussing the question, of organizing the
Trans-Mississippi Cattlemen's Associa
tion as an auxiliary to the National Live- |
stock Association. Mr. Lusk of Califor
nia, in speaking of the movement, said:
"It Is not In opposition to the Nationar
Livestock Association, of which we will
remain members, and which we help in
every way possible."
A committee has been appointed to ar
range the details of the organization.

Nine Years Later His Cure Remained
Permanent.
In a later letter, written January 1, 1899,
Mr. Hattenberg-er says:
"/ am in splendid health at present
and I am not in need of any medi-
cine. However, I always keep a bot-
tle of Peruna in my house. Some-
times I catch a little cold, but a few
doses of Peruna stops that right away.
"It is through Peruna that I enjoy
such good health, and I recommend it
to all who suffer from catarrh the
same as I did." â Peter Hattenberger.
Peruna Is a Natural and Efficient
Nerve Tonic.
Peruna strengthens and restores the
activity of every nerve in the body.
Through the use of Peruna the weakened
or overworked nerves resume their
natural strength and the blood vessels
at once begin to regrulate the Sow of
blood according to nature's laws. Con-'
gestlons Immediately disappear. All
phases of catarrh, acute or chronic, are
promptly and permanently cured.
It Is through its operation upon the
nervous system that Peruna has attained
euch a world-wide reputation as a sure
and reliable remedy for all phases of
pelvic catarrh known as female ailments.
It Is the best. If not the only, internal
remedy for pelvic catarrh ever devised by
the medical profession.
The Home of Peruna, Columbus, O.
Mr. B. Martens of Sigel, Wis.. writes:
"For some time my wife had been sick.
She was very thin, had no appetite, could
not sleep nights, and was troubled with
conBtipation.
"The physicians we consulted said It
â¢was dyspepsia. One of them said It was
catarrh. She could get no relief until
she began to take Peruna and Manalin.
Before she had taken half a bottle of
each she was conscious of a marked
change. .
"She began to sleep at night, appetite
came back, bowels were regular, and
now, after taking live bottles, she is en-
tirely well. She looks like a new woman.
"We cannot say half enough in praise
of your medicines. The physicians we
employed were very much surprised when
they learned that Peruna and Manalin
cured my wife."
There are no substitutes for Perufia.
Peruna is the only systemic catarrh
remedy on the market. No remedy be-
fore the public to-day can boast of as
many complete cures as Peruna.

WHAT the skin Is to the outside of
the body, the mucous membrane Is
to the inside of the body. Every
orgran. every duct and passage of the
body Is lined with mucous membranes.
A general flabbiness of these mucous
membranes constitutes what Dr. Hart-
man calls systemic catarrh. A person
with systemic catarrh cannot stand ex-
ertion. He is all tired out. He Is ner-
vous and fldg'etty. He Is sallow and de-
pressed. He has little zest for life and Is
unfitted for business.

In eystemlc ca-
tarrh there Is more
or less catarrh of every organ In the
body. The catarrh may have originated
in the head and throat, but it has final-
ly pervaded the whole system.
It produces a wretched condition. The
mucous membranes of the whole body re-
fuse to do their work properly. Sight,
hf-arir.g and taste are slightly affected.
The iungrs are weak; the voice husky. The
tonsils are red and inflamed. The stom-
ach does not digest food well. The liver
acts sluggishly.
Suffered From Catarrh, for Nine
Years â Was Cured in Five
Months.

Y~} RITISH newspapers are noting with considcr
r*\ able satisfaction certain statistics showing a
*â* rapid increase in the cultivation of fruit in Eng
land. Cheap grain of all kinds and cheap meats
shipped from foreign countries have made British ag
riculture a very dubious industry for many a year
past, and it now appears that v in some districts the
land-owners arc converting their fields into orchards.
In summing up the reports on the subject the
Westminster Gazette says: "Three years ago the area
under fruit was so nearly stationary that in 1808 bush
fruits showed only the infinitesimal increase of thirty
nine acres. Last year the increase was 1773 acrea,
while this year it has again risen by 2254 acres, and
orchard lands have at the same time increased by
3526 acres. The increase is not very great as yet, but
it is progressive, and, taken in connection with the
yearly shrinkage of cereal areas, is significant."
The planting of so many additional acres of land
in fruits is perhaps an evidence that agriculture in
England has about reached its limits. Growing bush
fruits may be more profitable in that country just now
than any other form of rural industry, but it can eas
ily be overdone. Moreover, as facilities for transpor
tation increase it will not be very long before such
fruits can be imported from abroad more cheaply than
they can be grown at home. Then the orchards will
be atfout as unprofitable as the wheat fields or the
pastures.
In fact, it seems the British will hardly be abj*
much longer to maintain any of their agricultural in
dustries in the face oj the competition permitted by
unrestricted freedom of trade. The British them
selves understand that well enouirh. and there is even
FRUIT GROWING IN ENGLAND.
PACIFIC EXPORTER.
WITH every new demand for special information
along lines not covered fully by the general
newspaper there comes promptly a periodical
to supply it. The expansion of Pacific Ocean com
merce with its stimulating effect upon the trade of
San Francisco has created such a demand on the part
of our manufacturers and merchants, and accordingly
the required publication has come. It is called the
"Pacific Exporter," and is under the editorship of
E. Ellsworth Carey, who, it is announced, has spent
two years in the Orient and is well posted on trade
topics in that part of the world.
The first number of the publication is a very attrac
tive one, not only in appearance but in contents.
It contains a sufficient number of illustrations to give
it liveliness, but the real object of the paper, that of
giving commercial information, is not sacrificed to
pictures. In fact, the table of contents is sufficiently
notable to carry the publication to success even if it
were less handsomely illustrated than it is.
We cannot at this time have too much in the way
of information concerning Pacific Ocean trade, nor
too much in the way of stimulus and encouragement
to our enterprising men to embark in it. Consequently
the Pacific Exporter is sure of a cordial welcome to
the field of trade journalism in California and bids
fair to attain there a success that will fitly reward
the efforts of its promoters!
WORDS OF GOOD PROMISE
/
PRESIDENT HAYS of the Southern Pacific
Company made a good impression upon the
public by his brief speech at the annual meet
ing of the Chamber uf Commerce. He did not say
many things, but what he did say means much to our
city and our State, and it is gratifying that in the very
simplicity and directness of the language there is evi
dence of a sincerity and an earnestness that give con
fidence in the speaker and in his assurance of a desire
to co-operate with the people of California for the
tdvancemer.t of all their commercial and industrial
interests.
After expressing his satisfaction and pleasure at the
cordial welcome given him in this city, President
Hays -.vent on to say: "I am not going to do more
than express my appreciation of that welcome, and
to say to you that I expect to make my home with
you. I want to be one of you and to be regarded as
such and to have you. feel that at any time, if there
ere any matters in regard to which the Southern Pa
cific Railway can work to mutual interest with you in
the development of the coast and of your business
interests, we shall at all times be only too glad to
give those'matters that consideration and that earnest,
careful regard which our mutual interests require."
President Hays may be sure the people of Califor
nia will gladly confer with him upon the mutual in
terests of the State and the raihoad. They will re
ciprocate every effort he may make to bring the
sometimes seemingly antagonistic interests of the two
irto complete harmony. Our people have not asked
o? the railroad anything more than justice and co
operation in all efforts to increase our industries and
expand our trade through the transportation which
that preat transcontinental system affords. In times
jiast the Southern Pacific Company, in this State at
least, has apparently been "much more intent upon
doing politics than upon doing business, and one of
the chief reasons why President Hays has been so
cordially welcomed here is that his coming promises
to be the beginning of a better order of things.
Under such circumstances the simple statement of
a frank interest in California and a cordial desire to
co-operate with the merchants of the city was better
than a long oration of vague promises would have
been. We do not at this time need a programme
from the Southern Pacific so much as a friend at the
liead of it, and that is what President Hays evidently
intends to be. His speech, therefore, despite its
brevity, was one of the most gratifying utterances of
the year, and has increased the cordiality of the wel
come with which Calilornians receive him as a fellow
citizen and a fellow worker.
AGRICULTURE IN flLflSKfl
SPECIAL AGENT GEORGESON of the
United States Agricultural Department, who has
recently returned from Alaska to make his third
annual report of the results of agricultural experi
ments there, is reported from Washington to be quite
sfinguine that Alaska will eventually be able to pro
duce all the food supplies necessary for the mainte
nance of a white population.
The experimental work which during the first year
was carried on mainly at Sitka has now been extended
uj* the coast as far as Cook Inlet. It consisted in
attempts at the cultivation of a large variety of cereals
and vegetables, and it is said that considerable suc
cess has been attained at many points.
The Washington correspondent of the New York
Sun, in giving an account of Professor Georgeson's
experiments, states: "He says that grain may b:
matured almost anywhere in the coast regions. He
brings samples of ripe barley, wheat, oats and rye,
some of which was grown twenty-five miles inland
?nd as far north as Cook Inlet and the Copper River
region in 60 degrees and 61 degrees north latitude.
Flax sown at Sitka attains a height of over three feet,
matures its seed and produces fiber of excellent qual
ity. On the. Kenai peninsula 320 acres of land have
been reserved for agricultural experiments and wheat
has been matured there. Kadiak and neighboring
islands and the large region westward is covered with
abundant grass, and cattle are being successfully
raised."
Of course too much in the way of expectation must
not be based upon these reports. It is one thing for
a Government to raise grain and vegetables in Alaska
by way of experiment, but it will be quite another
thing fos an individual to undertake it as an industry.
Still the results attained are unquestionably encour
aging. In her minerals and her fisheries Alaska has
resources of great value, but the cost of providing
food/ supplies for the persons operating them consti
tutes a serious difficulty in the way of their develop
ment. If therefore Alaska can produce vegetables,
hay and grain sufficient for men and animals working
along the coast the progress of the Territory may be
much more rapid than even the most sanguine have
c:cpectcd.

EUROPEAN PROBLEMS.
HENRI DE BLOWITZ, the famous Paris, cor
respondent of the London Times, is not among
tne optimists who prophesy, peace for Europe
in the near future. He perceives in the prospects
ahead not only signs of war, but reasons for believing
that war is inevitable. He has summed up his
opinions on the subject in a paper in the current
number of the North American Review, under the
title, "Coming Events and Present Problems," and
furnishes strong arguments to justify his gloomy view
of the situation. : .
The article opens with a declaration, that
Europe, and particularly France, is suffering from
social parasites, who are consuming its substance and
destroying the vitality of government. To them are
to be added as further evils in society the shiftless
and idle classes, and a third type of man to which he
gives the name "poseur? and whom he describes as "the
man of universal pretensions who is always ready with
an explanation, always ready to redress everything,
and who fancies he has the right to occupy any place
and play any role he fancies."
It is asserted that the malady caused by the ihree
bad social types "must be eliminated by France and by
aU Europe if France and Europe, who are suffering
diversely therefrom, would escape perdition," and it
is added: "In my opinion the problem of the sup
pression of this malady of social parasitism is to-day
the most pressing and serious one with which the cen
tury now opening will have to deal."
Â¦ From that point the writer goes on to say
he does not believe the twentieth century will equal
the nineteenth in the greatness of its achievements for
humanity. He says: "The new century will have to
continue and complete the inquiries of the old one,
to consolidate its work, and to shed more light across
the still obscure portions of the realms already dis
covered but not yet sufficiently opened up."
Then follows a passage of warning: "I catch
glimpses in the twentieth century of wars on wars
throughout its entire span. If the United States is
swept away by the wind of imperialism it must make
ready to sustain during the coming century formidable
struggles in order to assimilate what is still wanting
to the satisfaction of its imperialist dreams, and no
time should be lost in the preparation of the means
which will permit the serious realization of this ideal."
The source from which Blowitz expects the first
wars to arise is Austria. He says: "In the center
of Europe I see war break out on the morrow of the
death of Francis Joseph. There is not a single re
flecting being who can suppose that at Francis Jo
stph's death, the marvelous mosaic which from the
Austria of yesterday has become the Austria-Hungary
of to-day will continue to remain what it now is."
The struggle for the partition of the Austrian em-
Fire when once it begins to go to pieces will'involve
all the nations of the Continent. Germans, Slavs,
Hungarians and Italians will each demand a province,
and the French and the Russians will be irresistibly
drawn into the contest. One of the greatest wars of
history will follow, and when it is ended there will
be a new Europe.
Such is the forecast for the century made by one
of the acutest observers of the times. It closes with
a statement of more than ordinary interest, that the
supreme work of the twentieth century will be the
discovery of the full meaning and potency of elec
tricity. Blowitz says: "The solution of all the
problems which are tormenting the human mind is
bound up in this one. This solution will suppress
frontiers, change the aim of armies, subject the plane
tary spaces to the human will, modify altogether the
faith of the race, and give in general to the efforts
of its intelligence a fresh direction and an object as
yet undreamed of."
ASSEMBLYMAN BRADY'S resolution pro
posing an amendment to the constitution for
the purpose of providing for the regulation of
telephone rates may or may not be a good measure
advocated from an honest intent for the public wel
fare; but, whatever be the merits of the resolution
or the motive that prompted the author, it will have
at any rate the good effect of at once attracting pub
lic attention to the need of devising some system for
the regulation and the taxation of telephone corpora
tions.
It will be remembered that hardly had the new char
i ter of this city been adopted when it was discovered,
too late, .that telephone companies are exempted by
it from municipal regulation. The astute Mr. Pills
bury, attorney for the company, with the acquiescence
of Mayor Phelan, had worked the scheme upon the
voters and put the charter through with that glaring
defect in its terms.
Being thus cunningly saved from municipal regu
lation in this city, the managers of the corporation
have resorted to tactics equally cunning to evade
taxation. The main office of the Pacific States Tele
phone Company was removed to Portland, Or., to
escape State taxes, and the main office of the Sunset
Telephone Company was removed out of this county
for the purpose of escaping city taxes.
It will be seen that under the existing order of
things the telephone company is virtually absolved
from all duties to either the city or the State. While
all other corporations dealing in what are known as
public utilities are subject to municipal supervision
and regulation, that corporation is free, and while
ether property-owners have to pay taxes to the city
and to the State the property of the telephone cor
poration is largely exempt.
Upon that showing it is clear something must be
done to bring the telephone corporation under the
laws of the State and the city as other corporations
are. It must be made subject to proper regu
lations and must be compelled to pay its fair share of
taxes required to sustain the State and municipal
government. Up to that point there can be no dis
pute, and consequently the people look to the Legis
lature to take action upon the matter at the present
session.
The Brady resolution comes from - a suspicious
source, for the author is so close to Martin Kelly
that but little confidence can be placed in his pro
fessed zeal for the public good. It may be the resolu
tion has been introduced solely for the purpose of
forestalling another and perhaps a better bill, or it
may be it has been put forward merely to be with
drawn after it has served some purpose of its author
and his friends. All of these probabilities must be
taken into consideration by the Legislature. The
honest members of both houses should study the reso
lution closely and watch carefully every step of it;
progress. The issue is one of the most important of
the session, and care should.be taken to see that it be
not cunningly sidetracked.

Is thought, pays better.
The student who begins a chronological
study of the plays will first be struck by
the different suhjects that at different
times inspired Shakespeare's interest. In
essence. Indeed, there Is no change: from
first to last he was occupied with the
world of men around him. with their fol
lies and caprices as truly as with their
aspirations and their fate. Tn the first
group of plays the scope of his interest
is already clearly defined; he is concerned
with the pa'sslon that makes tragedy,
with the chances and weaknesses that are
the subject matter of comedy, and with
the great pageant of history that best
presented men in their outer activities.
At this time, however, Shakespeare's In
terest, broad as it was, centered on su
perficial matters: on the fun of trick and
affectation, on the physical tragedy that
revolts the sense, on the large movements
of history from which characters has as
yet hardly begun to emerge. But in his
next group of plays the young dramatist
had passed beyond a perception of the
superficial and accidental to a wide and
profound knowledge of the real life of real
people. Yet, though everything touched
his interest, and though everywhere he
saw deep into his subject, he paused long
est over the patriotic themes of history
and the joyous irresponsible life of youth.
Thus it was In.the creation of histories
and comedies that his art most character
istically expressed Itself. In the histories
we see reflected not only the great page
ant of battle and of court that appealed
f>o strongly to the Elizabethans, but tha
great men that then livedâ and that large
ly because of Shakespeare still liveâ In
the memory of English-speaking people.
The comedies, however, most clearly re
veal the variety and vitality of Shakes
peare's interests at this time. The fairy
beauty of ".Midsummer Night's Dream,"
the rough bolsterousness of the "Taming
of -the Shrew," the wisdom In folly in
tho latw comedies show different phases
of delight In the mere living of a life
detached from immediate moral issues.
To thia mood Falstafr, gives Immortal ex
pression, though his pathetic fall from
royal favor may hint, ns does the under
tone of tragedy in "The Merchant of
Venice," at a growing sense of the deeper
import of men's deeds. Â¦
In the plays of the next group this per
ception of the vital issues of character
conditioned the range of Shakespeare's
sympathy. With the writing of "Julius
Two darinp thieves, for whom Captain

Just hero the student should take ac
count of his forces and plan his work ac
cordingly. To understand the relation of
fach of his plays to Shakespeare's devel
opment is a long task, and* the wise
reader, warned of its magnitude, will
choose for early study those works that
are highly significant in the poet's spirit
ual and artistic history. Thus he will
early form for himself a vivid idea of the
point from which Shakespeare set out asl
artist and thinker and of the stages 1
through which he progressively passed in
Ins poetic career. Of the well defined
stages or periods in his developmenf there
are four. The first, from "Titua Andron
iciis" U5$S-fcO> to "Two Gentlemen of
Verona" <159'-'-93), was a time of imitation
and experiment and bore fruit in his
earliest enmedies and in his first crude
attempts at historical plays and tragedy.
In the period between "Midsummer
Night's Dream" (139C-94) and "Twelfth
Night" (1600-01) he pas?ed quite out of his
apprenticeship nni' used a perfected art
to reproduce the vivid and many colored
life of his times. Between the writing of
"Julius Caesar" (1911) and of "Corio
lanus" (160SÂ» Shakfspoare. whether or not
from the touch of personal sorrow, con
centrated his attention on the tragic strug
gle of men against an external fate or
their own divided natures. In his last
Ktoup of plays, from "Pericles" (1608) to
â¢Henry V1I1" (1612-13). he continued to
deal with the great problems of character
and destiny. But the world that he pre
sents knows no law save that of beauty,
and the plays of this time are rightly
called romances because In them the chain
cf causality is broken and intellect and
spirit reign supreme, untouched either by
weakness in themselves or by tho external
forces of nature. Thesf periods Professor
Dowden respectively characterizes as "in
the workshop." "in the world," "out of
the depths" and "on the heights."
In this broad classification of the plays
several 'are omitted bocause they are In
character transitional and should be
studied after the lines of Shakespeare's
development are clear to the student. The
best Introduction to Shakespeare would
undoubtedly come through the study of
the great works of the two central groups
â that is, of those plays which deal most
forcefully with actual life. To guide the
student who cannot conveniently refer to
the books on the subject the plays are
here given in chronological order. The
list is taken from Professor Dowden's
"Shakespeare Primer" (Macmillan), a lit

"Read the plays from beginning to end.
Know everything that the greatest of
English poets has written," Is perhaps the
most fruitful 3dvice that can be given to
the young student of Shakespeare. Yet he
hardly begins to act on it. hardly comes to
uhderstand something of Shakespeare's
infinite knowledge of life and of the in
finite variety of his art, when he falls Into
a state of perplexity at the Inconsistencies
and contradictions that confront him. It
seems at rirst sight impossible that the
poet who delights in the boisterous farce
of "The Comedy KDf Errors" should com
prehend the spiritual struggles of Hamlet
or that the elaborate and artificial dia
logue of "Love's Labor's Lost" should come
from the same hand as the poetry of "The
Tempest." If the multitude of questions
such as these suggested by even a super
ficial reading of Shakespeare remain un
answered, we rcay Indeed wonder at him
as the "myriad-minded" of the world's
poets, but we can form no idea v of his
orderly mental and artistic development.
Only when we consider each play in Its
relation to hÂ»Â« other works, and remem
ber the time and circumstances in which
it was written do we begin to understand
tho genius of the great dramatist, who
was from the. firEt interested In the whole
o* life, yet was constantly passing on to
a deeper comprehension of its Issues and
to a finer sympathy with its vicissitudes.
The chronological study of the plays has
inspired scholars to the most careful re
search; yet so universal and vital Is the
interest involved in Shakespeare's devel
oping art that even the general reader
may find In its study the means to en
lighten and enrich his knowledge. Lack
of reference books, as well as want of
requisite scholarship, will, it is true, pre
vent him in great part from study of the
more or less purely external evidences of
the dates of the plays â entrances in the
register of the Stationers' Company; ref
erences in writings of the day to the time
and circumstances of the presentation of
a play; allusions to the plays, quotations
from them or imitations of them in con
temporary writers, and references in the
plays themselves to historical events, or
quotations from or allusions to contem
porary literature. The internal evidences,
on the other hand, depend chiefly on the
lareful and intelligent study of the plays
themselves. They are, moreover, as their
name implies, so integral a part of Shake
speare's work ti:at they appeal at once to
every open-minded reader. Kor elementary
study they most naturally center around
Shakespeare's widening interest In life
and around his growing power as an
artist.

Caesar." If we may judge .hy the testi
mony of his works. Shakespeare's Inter
ests at once narrowed anii intensified
themselves. Full of action, as prays of
this time are, they are wholly concerned
â¢with a losing struggle of man -with hi*
fate. This concentration on the tragic
aspects of life bears fruit in the power
with which the secrets of character are
grasped and portrayed. The dramatist
now occupies himself w^th the study of
human nature, not in it3 spontaneous
self-expression or in its practical effec
tiveness and force, but in those struggles*
with destiny that reveal the very secreu*
of the soul. The questions suggested In
these plays are solved in those that fol
lowed them. It is at least true that.
though still Intent on the study of hu
manity, Shakespeare could in his latest
plays regard men as complete in their
own intellectual and spiritual existence
and so creating a world above tho possi
bilityâor necessity â of final loss.
There is a perennial fascination in
tracing the change in Shakespeare's plot
structure ana characterization from the
comparative artificiality of his earlier
dramas to the freedom, and even thÂ«Â»
license, of his latest years. The subject 13
too large to allow of more than sugges
tion; but the student interested in it will
find the careful analysis of the plots and
a thorough Investigation of the means of
character portrayal as delightful In them
selves as rich in suggestion of Shake
speare's growth. The development of his
art naturally accompanies tho widening 1
and deepening: of his sympathy with real
life. The time of interest in crude horror
or superficial humor was inevitably the
season of artistic Imitation and experi
ment, with a comparatively artificial plot
structure and characters lightly sketched
and somewhat conventionally grouped.
Even the doubt as to Shakespeare's part
in the authorship of "Titus Andronicus"
and "Henry VI" forces the critic at once
to consider hia relation to the drama of
his time and the means by which he at
tained to an early independence in his art
Brit Shakespeare passed with marvelous
speed from his tentative craftsmanship to
the complete mastery of dramatic tech
nique, and from the beginning of the sec
ond period of his work we can best trace
his growth as an arti3t by noting: the
molding of the form to the thought that
inspires H. The student who Is interested
in the subject will do well first to study
carefully one of the earliest and one of
the latest of the plays of Shakespeare's
independence. "The Merchant of Venice"
for instance will show his perfected art
and the point toward which earlier ex
periments had tended, while "The Tem
pest," one of his latest playa, will throw
light on many points In thÂ« workmanship
of the intermediate dramas.
A test of the date of a play more simple
and evident than its plot structure or
characterization is found in its verse. In
his youth Shakespeare habitually used
blank verse of the more formal type, with
a proportionately large number of rhym
ing couplets: In his last dramas he prac
tically dropped rhyme and used a blank
verse that varied as widely as possible
from the norm. Blank verse consists of
unrhymed iambic pentameter, or lines
made up of five iambic feet. The accent
thus naturally falls at the end of
the verse, the sense often ending.
or pausing somewhat, at this point.
A characteristic example of his ear
lier verse, adhering closely to this*
typical form. Is shown In the following
extract. Tbe accents are given to show
more plainly the nature of the lines:
A heavier task' could not' have been' Impos'd'
Than I' to speak' my griefs' unspeak'able':
Yet, that' the world' may wit'ness that' my end*
Was wrought' by na'ture, not' by vile' offense',
I'll ut'ter what' my sor'row gives' me leave'.
"Comedy of Errors," act I, scene 1. 11. 32-36.
Perhaps the. most important way in
which Shakespeare later modified the
verse was by the running of the meaning
from line to line, thus adding infinitely to
the variety of poetic effect. The strength
of this tendency appears in the fact tnat
the proportion of run-cn Iine3, or lines at
whose close there is no break in sense, is
in "Love's Labor's Lost" a little less than
one Â«n eighteen: in "Winter's Tale" a lit
tle less than one in two. To realize the
effect of this change one must read aloud
a number of passages, but the following
selection carefully compared with the pre
ceding one will at least suggest this char
acteristic quality of the later verse: <
By accident most strange, bountiful fortune.
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by toy prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose Influence,
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop.
"The Tempest." act I, scene il, 11. 17S-1S4.
Another peculiarity In Shakespeare's
later plays Is his ending the line by an
additional unaccented syllable. The double
or feminine ending of which the following
lines are an example is a common form of
this:
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Sylvia's chamber- window.
Besides this "double ending" an unac
cented monosyllable is often added to the
line, and, before a pause in the middle,
one or more unaccented syllabjes follow
a perfect foot. The result on the music
of the verse of the simplest of these
changes will be seen by contrasting the
effect of the following passage with that
of the lines quoted from "The Comedy of
Oh. It Is monstrous, monstrous!
Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me. and the thunder.
That deep and dreadful organplpe, pronounced
The name of Prosper; it did bass mv trespass,
Therefore my son In the ooze Is bedded: and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet
sounded. -
And with him there lie mudded.
"The Tempest," act III, scene 111, II. 95-1M.
The running on of the sense from line
to line and the filling: of the lines with one
or more additional syllables are among/,
the most evident of .the many changes in
Shakespeare's verse, but when once their
significance is understood the way is open.
Â¦ to a fine comprehension of the varied art
through which the master of rhythm at
tunes his verse to hia thought. The sub
stitution of a foot other than the iambic
and the more irregular pauses in the later
lines giving their many delicate shadlnga
to the verse are oulckly noted when one
has become sensitive to the more striking
modifications of Its form. ,
In so brief a sketch as this only the
more Important lines of chronological
study can be suggested, but the reader of
Shakespeore will at once think of many
another subject for similar h-iveatlgatton.

vere, gain an understanding" of Shakes
peare's thought that will invigorate hia

Locators of IMscovery Claim Sue Him
for $430,000.
The alleged usurpation of authority on
tho part, of Receiver Alexander McKcn
zle will be discussed in tho Superior Court
of San Francisco, as suits were filed with
Judge Frank H. Dunne yesterday against
McKenzie by Japet I^lndberg, EriK O.
LJndblom and John Bryneson, locators of
Discovery claim. They allege that Mc-
Kenzie in his capacity as receiver has
damaged them to the extent of $430,000.
Tbo claim is valued at J200.000. their min
ing rights at $190,000 and the mining tools,
which they allege McKenzie ruined, at
$40,000.
It is asserted that McKenzie seized the
property In pursuance with an agreement
with Robert Chipps. who claimed some
Interest In tho property.
J. C. Campbell and William II. Metson
are the attorneys for 1-,'ndberg and his
partners. Metson recently returned from
the Nome district, where he represnted
the interests opposed to McKenzie.
Arguments in the case of Receiver Alex
ander McKf-nzic, cited for contempt of
the United State* Circuit Court of Ap
petlls, wore concluded yesterday In that
tribunal by ,\. c.\ Severance; Thomas J.
Geary, E. f>. Tillsbury, AV. H. Metson and
Charles Page. Judges Gilbert, Morrow
and Ross occupied the bench and dis
missed the plea of lack of jurisdiction in
the four cat-cs at bar, namely, Tornahses
vs. Me!?Iliff, Kjellman vs. Rogers, Linde
bcig vs. (Jhlpps and Anderson vs. Oomp
tois.
uir. Severance then read the answer nf
Alexander McKenzje to the citation re
quiring him to appear and . show cause
why -he should not be punished for con
tempt, 'i he answer recited that AIcKen
7.U; had never intended to disobey the or
ders of the Court of Appeals or to show
to the honorable court any disrespect, and
that he had been prevented from acting
under the process issued by the Court of
Appeals by an Injunction issued by Judge
Arthur H. Noyfes, the United States Dis
trict Judge at Nome.
Mr. Severance 'asked that the facts
should bo brought out in opon court and
not before the Court Commissioner. He
mentioned the Dubose contempt case and
said that three months had been consumed
by the Commissioner and tlu> lawyers in
taking a maps of testimony, most of
which was altogether foreign to the issue
Involved.
The Judges decided that they would
take the testimony In open court of Jan
uary 23 at 11 a. m.. to which day and hour
the court took an adjournment. --"'
SUIT AGAINST McKENZIE.
United Slates Circuit Court
Holds It Has Full
Jurisdiction.
McKEMZIE'S PLEA
DOES NOT AVAIL
The Supervisors' Judiciary- Committed
reported yesterday j n favor of the ordin
ance fixing the fare to be charged on
streetcars for pupils of public and pri
vate, schools who ar# under the age of IS
years at 2y 2 cents. The ordinance was
amended so that the nrlvllege will be en
joyed between the hours of 8 and 9 a. m..
12 and I p. m., 2:30 and 4 p. m. and 6:30
and 9:20 i>. m.
Braunhart addressed the committee, m
favor of the ordinance. He read a letter
from Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles whlcn
stated that public wcho<Tt" pupils in tha
city under the age of 18 years were car
ried for half fare. Braunhart contended
that more children would ride at the re
duced rate and the revenues of the com
panies would increase.
The representatives of the street rail
way companies argued against the pass
age of the ordinance. Attorney Foulds
stated that the cost of carrying each
passenger is 4 J ,a cents and If the com
panies are forced to carry them for 2 1 -.
cents it will be a losing proposition. Foulas
held that there was no justice in levying
a special tax on the ?lreet railway com
panies, which are already paying their
share for the support of tne schools. â¢ f Is
objected to the private schools being maao
beneficiaries under the ordinance. The
vast number of transfer privileges now in
force was a concession of the companies,
Koulds said, and that was as far as they
couldÂ»be expected to go. he added.
Secretary Clayton said that establish
ing a precedent was a serious matter with
street railroads. He thought better results
might be accompllshfetf in a possiole rfi
nuction of fares^if the Supervisors ha.l
appointed a committee to confer with thÂ«
companies rather than by trying o forc-i
the issue by the passage of an ordinance
Superintendent Harris of the Californiii
street line s-aid that if the 2VÂ£-cent fate
prevailed the transfer privileges wouM
compel the carrying of passengers for V&
tents on the arrangement between the
companies, else the tiansfers would have
to be -done away with. He did not think
that the reduced fare would result in in
creared patronage and he feared that the
companies would suffer from abuse of tho
privilege of riding at a half rate.
A. K. Stevens, secretary of the Suttcr
fitreet Railway Company, said that tho
reduced fare would be a practical conlls
cation of the street railway properties.
Stevens appealed to the committee not to
recommend the ordinance on etiuitablo
principles, which led Tcibin to remark
that the condition In which Bush stree:
had bren left by the Sutter-stroet com
pany was hardly equitable to the city.
Amendment Adopted So That Priv
ilege May Be Enjoyad During
Certain Hours â Street Rail

Passage of Proposed
Ordinance.

regular during the early dealings, but there
were eufflcler.t points ol Â£tren*?th to overcome
the few opening declines caused by sympathy
with the London market and with the weak

disposition to realize also in the coalers and
New York Stock Market.
CHICAGO, Jan. 16.â May Wheat opened %3
96c lower at 76% to 76Hc, mainly because Liver
pool showed a full response to the decline on
this Bide yesterday. The crowd, however, was
Inclined to keep a keen eye on Wall street and
a curb on their speculative desires, rather than
on the legitimate situation. To buying from
this quarter is attributed the bulge of a week
ago, and to a withdrawal of this support i3
credited the recent declining tendency of the
market. Wall streot. however. Is still believed
to be long and this combined with the stiff
ness of some local long lines, leaves the rank
and file on tenterhooks. At the opening some
Inconsequential Belling by a house supposed to
represent Wall street brought out all sorts
of small stuff and May dropped to 76%@76V4c.
Here the pressure eased and on reports of ex
port engagements, the market gradually ral
lied to 76T4C. Attempted realizing showed how
slack the demand has grown. The decline
caught stop-loss orders and the market near
the end of the session dropped sharply to 75Vic
The close was weak, H4<3'1% lower at 75%Â©
75%c. Exporters reported sixty-two loads tak
en. Seaboard clearances in wheat and flour
were equal to 477,000 bushels.
Corn was dull and easier, partly on the im
proved weather, but mainly with wheat. Coun
try acceptances were light and the cash de
mand fair, but business was curtailed by the
scarcity of cars. May closed U@%c lower

The cash demand waa fair and Borne export
business was done direct. Some selling eariy

The Prune Cut in New York.
Mell advices from New Tork eay: "The re
duction by the California Cured Fruit Associa
tion of prices en all except the 'four eizes'
cf prunes was the feature among the dried
fruit trade yesterday. A reduction of lc per
pound is made en M-COs, of **c on 40-50s and
l ?c en 100-12>. Prices are guaranteed and the
association has provided for a rebate equal
to the decline to all Jobbers now having prunes
on hind. The consensus of local opinion ap
pears to be that, whil(Â» the association should
have pone further in lowering prices, still at
the revised quotations prunes should move out
better from the coast. feroand for j0-C0f, It
is thought, should pick up considerably. How
ever, It is not apparent that even at the de
cline the trade here will buy at all liberally.
The Weather and the s.l>ii"danre of fresh fr'>Â«tÂ«
have thus far largely held back consumptive
demand, and until this Improves decidedly
Jobbers oro likely to ttiuW no treat disposition
to buy riruses.
"The ia.is:n situatim continues more hope
ful here and prices are being heM up on the
coast. Demand from teeders and jobbers Is
improving. Gcod 3-crown loofe are mostly held
at C^o, with some fair quality offering at 6c.
Apricots are firm, evaporated apples easier.
"There is a bt-tter hiijuiiy for walnuts, es- ;
peeially French ar.d Or*enob;es. Sme holders
csk V)^c firm tor Grenoblee. Filt^rts are
weak; almonds inclined to be firmer."
continues on so large a scale that the Interest
1 ate tended lower to pay in spite of the gold
exports, and the softness of the exchange mar
ket showed that the absorption of exchange
bills sold against the gold exports was not
easy.
The bond market was moderately active and
eased eff in sympathy with stocks. Total sales,
par value, $2,390,000.

London Wool Market.
BOSTON, Jan. 16.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The past
week In the wool trade has been about as
quiet as possible. There has been no material
change In business here. Mills, have not shown
any great tendency to come around to the
dealers' terms and on his part the dealer feels
that he is not so pushed that'he must come to
the buyer and beg him to relieve him of his
load. An Impression has gone around that the
American Woolen Company has been making
good sized and frequent purchases of wool since
January 1. some dealers estimating the com
pany's purchases In the millions. One report
has been current around the market that a
million pound* changed hands last week, with
the combine \x% the purchasers. This can be
denied in the strongest terms and on the best
authority. The American Woolen Company did
buy a considerable amount of wool a month
or so ago and bought it for delivery after Jan
uary l. Hence it is very easy to see why
they should have been moving a considerable
quantity of late. They have been taking up.
not buying up, a considerable Quantity of wool.
The fact is that the buyers of the company
did not make a single purchase during the lat
ter half of last week and that their total pur
chases for the week would not amount to half
a million pounds. The sales for the week in
Boston amounted to 1,520,000 pounds domestic
and 195,000 pounds foreign, making a total of
L715.000 pounds, against a total of 1,710.000
pounds for the previous week and a. total of
2,965.000 pounds for the corresponding week last
year. The sales since' January 1 amount to
4,874,000 pounds, against 8,035,600 pounds for the
corresponding time last year.

NEW YORK. Jan. 16.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were Black but firm to-day,
although the call for troops for South Africa
was disliked.
Americans began at about half under parity,
but recovered In the first hour. They re
mained quiet till Just .before the close, when
St. Paul and Northern' Pacific Bpurted sharply
on New York orders attributed to the so-called
Morgan deal. Their buoyancy, however, failed
to stimulate the general rise.
Call mpney rates were unsettled. The bank
lent a large sum for a few days at 6% per
cent. It bought Â£120.000 gold In bars.
The copper fortnightly statistics show a de
crease in stocks of 612 tons and in supplies of
108 tons.

try and o/ music. "The golden harp on
the banner of green," said . he, "is sym
bolic of Ireland, the nation of music and
song." He next compared the -melodies
of Ireland with those of other nations and
said that they were . universally admitted
to be i the purest and sweetest on i earth.

THE PHOTOGRAPHIC SALON IN MARK HOPKINS INSTITUTE OF ART. CLEVER MEN AND "WOMEN
THE WORLD OVER HAVE CONTRIBUTED.
THE first Photographic Salon held
in San Francisco, which will
open to the public this evening
at the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art, bids fair to be an extra
ordinary success for a first ' at
tempt in this direction. The exhibition Is
to be held under the auspices of the Cali
fornia Camera Club, which has succeeded
In attracting the attention of artistic
photographers In almost every State In
the Union, in addition to obtaining exhi
bits from England and "Bonnie Scotland."
Altogether, about 1500 pictures were en
tered, in competition for. the various
prizes, and of these 700 have been chosen
to adorn the walls. The hanging of the
exhibition Is completed, and the

The latest fads are all represented. A
rank Impressionism, In which everything
Is left to the imagination, has a single
exponent In C. Ackerman, who shows "A

artist's word only, as the photograph
might be that or anything else one chose
to call It. W. J. Cassard of New York Is
a realist per contra, and shows some quite
eatable peaches. C. Yarnall Abbott, also
a man of Gotham, has a couple of admir
able nudes, and some Quite wonderful red

SAN JOSF FIRM
IS IN TROUBLE
Sheriff Levies Upon the T.
W. Spring Company's
Stock.
SAX JOSE. Jan. 16.â The firm of T. "W.
Spring Company was levied upon to
day by Sheriff Langford under an execu
tion issued to Joseph S. Silverbersr In San
Francisco for J33.S41 22. The Sheriff at
once closed tho doors and put the keys in
his pocket.
The firm 13 one of the oldest In Santa
Clara County and until a couple of yean
ago was one of the most prosperous. It
was established by the late T. W. Spring
at the corner of Market and Santa Clara
streets and has occupied that location for
thirty-four years. At the death of Mr.
Spring It passed to his children. The
execution obtained by Sllverberg. who
represents Schweitzer & Co. of New York.
Is for goods purchased In the clotnln<
lines. It 13 directed against Fred W.
Moore and Marcella S. Moore. hi3 wife,
who . comprise the firm of Spring Com
pany, and was obtained In Judge Dunn's
court in San Francisco. There are costs
also of $7 and interest at tho rate of 7 per
cent from date of execution.
Henry M. M. Spring, a son of T. W.
Spring, waa at the head of the company
until about eighteen months ago. At that
tlmo Mrs. Emily Spring. hl3 wife, sued
him for divorce and obtained a decree on
charges of infidelity. She was granted
$150 a month alimony. Spring turned thÂ»
store and other property over to his
6lster. Mrs. Moore. And her husband and
fled East to avoid the payment of ali
mony. There is nearly -$3000 due Mrs.
Spring and she also has an execution
against the firm and an order of sale. For
some time the Sheriff has been, trying- to
sell the store under the order, but Moore
has refused to allow him to enter the
place. On a number of occasions when
the time for the aale was set Moore locked
the doors and kÂ»pt the official out.' A3

"Naughty Anthony'' company, now play
ing in Kansas City, Is heiress to half a
million dollars left by her greatuncle, Jo
seph Le Gueval. The bequest unfolds a
bit of family history that reads like a ro
mance. Joseph and Pierre " Le Gueval,
brothers, lived In the picturesque town
of Palmehol, in Prance, on the Knglish
Channel. They parted in 18G4, Pierre com
ing to America and moving to the Pacific
Coast, where he became interested in
large railroad contracts and other proj-cts
with the late Marcus Daly. Pierre's wife
had died in France and he was accom
panied by his daughter Annetta, six years
old. Sixteen years later Annetta married
Malachl Grogan In San Francisco.
In 1S95 Joseph - Le Gueval came to the
United States to seek his heirs. In San
Francisco he found his niece, Mrs. Gro
gan, who had become a widow, with her
daughter Daisy.; The old man was
charmed with the beauty and intelligence
of his grandniece and took her back to
France with him to complete her educa
tion, promising to make her his sole heir

MRS. KINCAID PRESIDES OVER
THE SCHOOL BOARD MEETING
She Is Addressed as "Mrs. President," "Madam/!
"Madam President" and "Mrs. Chairman/ 1
FOR THE FIRST TIME A MEMBER OF THE FAIR SEX PRESIDES OVER A MUNICIPAL BOARD, AND HER
FELLOW DIRECTORS, ALL MALES, SEEM TO VARY IN THEIR OPINIONS AS TO HOW SHE SHOULD
BE ADDRESSED.
YESTERDAT was a red letter day
for those women of San Pranelsco
ambitious for the recognition of
their sex In governmental affairs,
for It marked the first time of a
Â¦weman presiding over any branch of the
municipal government.
Mrs. liar}' Kincald yesterday morning
presided over the meeting of the Board
of Education, of which body she was
elected presiding officer last week, and
did so with becoming dignity.
Directors Casserly. Denman and Mark
have been unable to agree as to the proper
title they should bestow on the lady who
presides over the Board of Education and
at yesterday's meeting each one addressed
Mrs. Kincald in a different manner.
Before the meeting was called to order
there Â¦was every evidence tt}at something
unusual was to take place. Two large
bunches of fresh violets were on the
table In front of Mrs. Klncaid's seat:
potted ferns were set near the window of
the room where the board meets; every
thing In tlfe apartment was In apple-pie
order and the male School Directors
locked far from being composed.
Â¦ Director Casserly is the "Beau Brum
ir.el" of the board and In honor of Mrs.
Kincaid be wore a boutonniere of violets.
Director Mark displayed a posy ,' of red
carnations in his coat lapel, while Direc
tor Denman 'was moet carefully groomed.
FÂ»Â»cretary Hanson and his assistant, Mr.
Kooe, uere on hand early and Superin-
Director Denman was not quite sure of
the manner In which Mrs. Kincald should
be addressed, and though he spoke a num-
Director Mark was the next to place
himself on record and In taking part In a
discussion addressed Mrs. Kincald as
"Mrs. President."
"The secretary will please read the min
utes of the last meeting," said Mrs. Kln
caid, and she listened attentively to -Ir.
Hansen. Every presiding officer has a
pose, and Mrs. Kincald is no exception to
the rule. She sat yesterday with her left
elbow resting on the arm of her chair and
leaned her face on her linger tips.
To the credit of the male Directors no
grave error was made during the meeting
in addressing Mrs. Kincaid and those
who thought that she might be addressed
as "Mr. President" were disappointed.
Director Casserly was the first to form
ally address Mrs. Kincaid. With a court
ly bow he rose from his seat and In a
nervous manner addressed the presiding
official as "Madam President."
Secretary Hansen ptood up as he called
the names of the Directors, and while
the male Directors answered, "Here,"
Mrs. .Kincald politely answered, "Here,
sir."
Promptly at 10 a. m. Mrs. Kincald en
tered the board-room and took her seat
at the head of the table, where her asso
ciates were seated. She was neatly
gowned in a plum colored dress, trimmed
with black velvet, and wore no jewelry.
'â¢The meeting will please come to or
der," she said as she rapped the table
with her hand. "The secretary will call
the roll, please."
tendent Webster was also present to wel
come Mrs. Kincald.
ber of times, he did not address his re
marks to the lady at the head of the
table, but epoke to all present. After
half an hour, however, Denman evidently
had made up his mind. He did not agree
with the "Madam President" of Director
Casserly nor with the "Mra. President"
of Director Mark, and went on record by
addressing Mrs. Kincald as "Mra. Chair
man." Secretary Hansen contented him
self with ' "madam" and so did Assistant
Secretary Hooe. while Superintendent
Webster thought It more dignified to use
the term "Madam President."
The meeting lasted an hour and Mrs
Kincald showed that she waa well
acquainted with parliamentary rules, cor
recting her associates when they made
motions contrary to Cushing's Manual
The board established two new classes,
one In the Sherman Primary School and
one In the Washington Grammar School

RESCUE OF EIGHT JAPANESE
FROM A, DISMASTED SCHOONER
THE Toyo Klsen Kaisha Company's |
Hongkong Maru arrived from the
Orient yesterday, bringing with
her the crew of the wrecked Jap
anese schooner Seisho Maru. The
latter waa on her way from a small coast
port named Uragami to Toklo when on'
December 2 she was caught in a terrific
storm and blown out to sea. The masts
went by the board when the gale was at
Its height and every moment the fright
ened coolies expected to be their last, i or
nearly a month the little schooner drifted
around at the mercy of the wind and
waves and then the Hongkong Maru came
along and rescued the half-starved crew.
There were eight of them all told, and
they had little to eat save rice and water
all the time the schooner was a wreck.
The report of the Hongkong Maru sim
ply sets forth that "on January 2, in lati
tude 34 67 north, longitude 148 14 east,
sighted the Japanese schooner Seisho
Maru, dismasted and flying signals of dis
tress. Rescued crew and brought them to
San Francisco."
There was a heavy sea running at the
time, but Captain W. E. Filmer stopped

they don't sell .on the plan, of paying a

takes the goods back to the little at a

MRS. J. J. REY, a sister of Jo
seph Brltton and one of the
pioneer women of this State,
passed away suddenly last Mon
day at the family residence, 820
Union street, and was buried ! yesterday.
She had reached the advanced age of 71
years. Her death, which was evidently
due to old rage, came without the least
warning:, as she was attending- to her
household duties and apparently enjoy
ing the best of health.
Mrs. J. J. Rey was a native of England,
and with her father and mother came to
California forty-six years ago to Join her
â¢lney- Run One, lwo, Ihree and Four in
the Stake at Union Coursing Park.
HONORS ARE EASY FOR CURTIS' DOGS
brother, who had emigrated hither In 1843.
Shortly after her arrival here she became
the wife of John Jacques Rey, her broth
er's partner In business. Her life, which
was devoted to her home and her chil
dren, was an exceedingly happy and beau
tiful one. Mr. Brltton, his sister and her
husband formed one household, whose
hospitality was its chief characteristic.
Mrs. Rey, was a domestic woman in 'the
full sense of the, word. She cared little
for society and "fcever Interested herself
In the contentions which agitate many
members of her sex. Retiring in disposi
tion, she rarely crossed the threshold of
her home except when necessity re
cuired It.
"Glaze offered to buy the business from
us and we were willing to take- his offer,
but I discovered to-day that he had en
deavored to secure a loan on the furni
ture, which fact he always kept secret
from us.
"Some weeks before my husband's death
I asked him to force Glaze to file a state
ment of the condition of the business He
finally obeyed my suggestion and the re
sult was that an account was turned In
to us by Glaze on which items amounting
to several hundred dollars appeared
which neither myself nor my husband
knew anything about On investigation
we found that Glaze had overdrawn his
account several hundred dollars, had run
up a prodigious bar bill, which we were
paying for; had purchased silk dresses
and other expensive clothing, which were
charged to the copartnership, and last,
but not least, that a large amount of beer
and other liquids were being consumed by
Glaze and his family in their apartments.
I would never have discovered this last
fact had it not been for an effort on the
part of Glaze to secretly remove the bot
tles from the room. Then again- one day
he tried to force a porter, whom I only
knew by the name of 'Robert,' but whom
I will see Is found to testify in this case,
to loan him $500 during the time In which
my husband was forcing Glaze for a
settlement. Mr. Mocha, who is employed
here, will also testify to similar facts, and
also to the fact that Glaze frequently car
ried a revolver when in an excited mood,
caused by his financial difficulties."
In view of the facts tending to estab
lish the motive for the killing advanced
by Mrs. Trewhella, an expert will be put
to work on the books to-day.
Mrs. Trewhella gave her version of the
trouble caused on Sunday night by Mrs.
Glaze, and said that Mr. Trewhella did
not strike Mrs. Glaze In trying to put
her out of his apartments. He simply put
his hand on her shoulder, she said. Mrs
Trewhella then told how her husband had
helped Glaze in every way in the suit
which was brought against Glaze by the
man who found for him a partner in the
hotel. Mrs. Trewhella declared that she
had never known her husband to have a
pistol in his possession during the twenty
odd years they had been married, and
that when his sons had a pistol he warned
them to put It away, as many men had
been killed by carrying a weapon of that
kind.
Mrs. Trewhella also said that a large
sum of money should be on deposit at the
Donohoe-Kelly Bank to the credit of her
husband and Glaze, but that she had in
quired and found that only $60 was on
hand to the firm's credit. Â¦
The testimony secured by the police yes
terday is of a most serious nature, and so
far not a particle of evidence has come
to light to substantiate the claim made
by Glaze that he shot Trewhella In self
defense. .
Detectives Cody and McMahon yester
day located the gun store where. Glaze
bought the cartridges and tried his re
volver. The store Is owned by H EL
Skinner & Co., and is situated at 416 Mar
ket street.
Hippsley Justain. a salesman in the
store, made a statement to the police that
he had Known Glaze for many years: On
Monday, between noon and 1 p. m., Glaze
came Into the store and asked Justain to
fix a revolver. Justain did so, and Glaze
then bought a box of cartridges. Justain
went with Glaze Into the basement of the
store, where both flred two shots from
the pistol. Justain says that Glaze was
perfectly cool and collected and seemed
to be the same as usual.
The statement published yesterday In a
morning paper that Glaze had received
a letter on Monday last from C. D. Davis
a real estate man, to the effect that
Trewhella had made threats against the
life of Glaze, is absolutely untrue. Davis
called at police headquarters yesterday
and was very indignant over the false
publication. The letter Davis wrote to
Glaze was dated last Saturday and was
delivered at the Windsor Hotel on Mon
day morning. The letter was In Glaze's
pocket when he was searched at the
prison. It referred to a proposition made
by Glaze to secure a loan from Davis
and his partner, Rives, on security of a
chattel mortgage on the furniture of the
Windsor Hotel and contained absolutely
no reference to Trewhella.
Another letter found on Glaze was from
a man on Montgomery street, giving In
formation ae â¢ to loans on furniture, â etc.
The lease of the Windsor Hotel. was also
In Glaze's pocket when he was searched
by the police.
Davis made a~ statement to Captain of
Detectives Seymour last night. ( in which
he told of the negotiations made - with
him by Glaze, who wanted to get a loan
on the furniture of the Windsor Hotel
for the purpose' of buying Trewhella out.
T>as=t Friday Davis went to the hotel and
met Glaze, who introduced him to Trew
hella,- Â¦Â¦ Â¦
Mrs. Lulu Â¦ Spencer, a â¢waitress, Â¦ also
made a statement to. the police last night.
On Sunday- last she heard Glaze '-say Â»to
Trewhella. "I if I don't settle
this to-morrow." She spoke of Trqwhella
as a very quiet man and said Glaze would
get very cross at times. Whenever Glaze
spoke sharply to Trewhella, theÂ» latter
would say nothing in reply, but would
walk away.
The- funeral of Trewhella . will take
placo to-day, and the Inquest will be held
to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock. .
Funeral Will Be Bsld
To-day.
An expert accountant will supplant the
detectives In searching for the motive for
! the kllllngr of William Trewhella by Rob-
I ert E. Glaze at the Windsor Hotel last
| Monday afternoon. The detectives, short
! ly after the killing of Trewhella, aban
doned all theories chat other than mat
ters of finance were responsible for the
: violent death of Trewhella.
In a long Interview with Chief of Police
Sullivan and Captain of Detectives Sey
mour yesterday Mrs. Trewhella gave her
version of the financial difficulties that
had existed for some time between her
husband and Glaze.
Her suspicionâ her belief, in factâ that
no other motive than the one stated ex
isted was strengthened by the Ming of a
suit yesterday by Gla^e and his wife
against her and others whom the plain
tiffs allege have an interest in the Wind
sor Ho^el. Joined witn Mrs. Trewhella as
defendants in the action are M. E. Tay
lor, William A. Millpr, Georjre Delapot Jr.,
W. M.. Brunt and Thomas Maton.
The plaintiffs demand an accounting
and settlement of the affairs of the co
partnership between Glaze and his vic
tim on the allegation that great dam
age and harm would come to them if the
hotel business was allowed to run with
out the guiding hand of an officer of thj
court. They oray that a receiver be ap
pointed to exercise his authority until ths
controversy has been settled by the final
judgment of the court.
Attorneys Vogelsang & Brown, on be
half of Glaze, applied to Superior Judge
Kerrigan and secured the appointment of
H. A. McCallister as receiver. Later in
the evening when the fact that the motive
for the appointment of a receiver had
been Impugned by Mrs. Trewhella, widow
of the deceased, became known Judge
Kerrigan limited the authority of the re
ceiver and will to-day take action to se
cure the better protection of all parties I
Interested. The appointment of a re
ceiver was Immediately seized upon , by
those named as, defendants In the action
Instituted by Glaze as the possible "steal
ing- of a point" on behalf of Glaze.
In regard to her belief that the killing
of her husband was due to a discrepancy*
in Glaze's accounts, Mrs. Trewhella said:
"My husband and Glaze never quarreled,
but both he and myself wera satisfied that
Glaze was robbing us. At 'one time my
husband and Glaze made propositions
each to buy the other's Interest. In
fact, I went to Auburn on Monday morn
ing last for the purpose of raising- money
In order that my husband might become
sole proprietor of the Windsor Hotel. Not
withstanding my husband's desire to buy
Glaze out, he frequently told me that in
asmuch as Glaze was the senior partner
In the firm, his wishes must be respected,
'and,' said my husband, 'though I do not
wish to leave the Windsor, I will take his
money and let him continue the business
alone."

May Thus Be Found

THE unused piano should now be a. thing of the past.
Wherever there is a piano an Angelus is needed. â¢ It is not
a self-playing piano, but a wonderful little instrument by
means of which any one can play any piano â not as a self-
playmg piano plays, but with the touch and technique of the
artistic musician, and with the individuality of the player never
. lost.
The Angelus piano player is the original piano
player, and with it the performer can produce effects not pos-
sible with any other. For example:
i. A piano playing alone. 4. A piano with flute effect.
i'-'i 2. An orchestral organ playing 5. A piano and full orchestral
alone. , organ combined all at ths
3. A piano with violin effect same time.
Angelus Piano Player is 9225.
Angelus Orchestral is from $250 to 9325. V
The Angelus is constantly on free exhibition on the third '
floor of Sherman, Clay & Co. (take elevator). Call and hear
the Angelus and you will see that every home with a piano
should have this wonderful instrument.
