Packer's aJleced crime was the murder
of a party of five prospectors In the wilds
of Colorado. He admitted that hÂ« killed
one of the men, who. he said, was Insane
and had assaulted him after murdering
the other four . with a hatchet. Packer
was one hundred miles from civilization
at the time and waÂ» compelled, he said,
to eat the flesh of the" mnrdered . men to
keep- from starving.
The attempted assassination of H. H.
Tammen and F. O. Bonfils. of the Den
ver Post, by W. W. Anderson, a lawyer,
about a year ago, resulted in the agita
tion of Packer's case.
DENVER, Colo.. Jan. 8.â The last offi

as Governor of the State to-day, was to

seventeen years. He was sentenced to a.
forty years' term in 1?S3.

DR. KINYOUN'S REMOVAL
As darkness fell the authorities were as
sembled on the shore and the lifeboats
were lying off awaiting the first opportu
nity to effect a rescue, but the latest dis
patch from the lighthouse keeper at Fara
rnan describes the position of the ship m
hopeless. It is probable that the vessel
and all on board will ucrtsh.
Rear Admiral Besson. naval prefect of
Marseilles, has telegraphed to Toulon for
the dispatch of the powerful tug Travall
leur immediately to the scene.
The wind Is still blowing a hurricane
with no sign of abatement. A great
crowd is assembled along the shores, ex
citedly watching the endeavors to com
municate with those en board the ship,
which is bumping' heavily as the sea?

but each time the line has fallen short.
MARSEILLES. Jan. S.â A terrible dis

on Â«he coast near the village of Faramari
during a violent storm with fifty passen

was heeled to the starboard and the
waves are sweeping ever her. Desperate
attempts to rescue her company by life

ever>" effort to appro?xh her.

Special Dirpatrh to TiÂ» CalL
PEKING, Jan. 8â There is considerable
talk as to the amount of indemnity to
be demanded by the allies and China's
ability to pay the same. While impos
sible at this time to state accurately the
a mount of damasen directly traceable to
the Boxer uprisi:^, J6jO.OJO,000 is general
ly mentioned as the b?-Â£is. It is hard to
figure on the equitable damages that
should be jÂ»aid for private lcsses. Prob
ably $3,000,000 would cover the losses to
Catholic missions and H.000,000 to those
cf Protestant denominations. These with
the destruction of 200 miles of railway
are practically the only private losses,
and Â£5,000,000 would certainly caver every
editable claim.
National Indemnities, however, are
v hat will swell the bill. These bills are
for the movement of troops. Germany's
Is the biggest of all. Her bill will be
from Â£05,000,000 to Â£16,000,000. England
will come next with a claim of about
Â£i:,000,000. France has net spent Â£5.000,
000. Italy only appropriated 30,000,000
francs. The amount the Japanese claim
is uncertain, but will certainly be noth
ing like xhat cf England and Germany.
Russia's action in withdrawing from
the concert of the powers and reaching
an agreement with China to s-ign a treaty
at St. Petersburg indicates that the Gov
crr.raent need hardly be included in the
rr.atter of indemnities, and if she makes
ar.y demand at all the amount certainly
â¢HI be a small one. The Comptroller
-Â»f ttÂ« Hussisja Treasury paid recently
the total expenditure of his Government
en account of Chinese expeditions was
less than 20,000,000 roubles. The claim of
the United States, also comparatively
email, will hardly exceed $5,000,000. Aus
triae claim will be Insignificant.
The figures, of course, only Include the
extra expense of bringing men here and
the cost of niaintenar.ee and transporting
them home. Takir.g all of these claims
ir.to consideration and allowing Â£1,000,000
more to cover every othc public expendi
ture and to build a palace to replace ev
*ry legation building hit by a bullet
t-rir.g the Elege, a very liberal estimate
cf the damages that could be equitably
a??essed will be frcm Â£50.000.000 to Â£C0,
coo.ooo.
People who are be?t informed as . to
Chinas finances. Including Sir Robe't
Hart. Imperial Director of Maritime Cus
tom, say she will be able to raise this sum
or. her own credit without any foreign
control cf her revenues, a scheme Â¦which
baa t'o^n a failure in every country where
tried and would likely lead to disputes be
i-wn the allies here and possibly to war.
The annual Income cf the Chinese Gov
err.rr>nt is 100,000,030 taels. One-fifth of
mip amount pay? the Intf-reFt on the F.ink-
Jr.sr furri now, and the best financiers say
it will bo Â¦urmeccfFary to increase the cus
fmF dutifs unless China is forced to
abandon the LiJ:in tar., which is very ob
Â¦jeetionable to foreign merchants. Th.?
rurrender of tho i.'kin tax Just now would
be undesirable, brcause it is the chi^T pro
vincial tax and supplies all funds for the
evpport of local governments.
Reverting to the destruction of the rail
reads one of the smaller nowers talks of
c^rRandÂ«r.g $40,000,000 in sold for this ac
tion, although only Â£50 miles of roadbed
Â¦was damaged. As a matter of fact the
raiiroafls have been practically restored
already without cost to the owners' ex
pense, the materials being squeezed out of
the people living in villages along the line.
Taking Â£40,000,000 as an equitable ad
justment of the Indemnities, the bill woull
require the deduction of money capture*!
by the allies at Tientsin and Peking. The
amount of this loot is estimated as high
&s Â£10.000,000.
THHJXS EMPRESS WILL EEXIJEi:
Archbishop Favier Optimistic Con-
cernir g Outlook in China.
PARIS, Jan. Eâ Archbishop Favler, the
head of the French Mission in Northern
Ciiina, who reached Marseilles January 3,
has arrived in Paris. In an interview he
eaid he believed the Empress Dowager
would return to Peking In the spring,
vrhen order will be completely restored.
The Europeans, he adds, will find that
they have not lost ground by recent
events. The Government, however, must
be given time to resume the direction of
affairs. Meanwhile the police work now
proceeding should be completed and the
lest bands of Boxers and looters dig.
pcrsed. Europe must not try to rush the
negotiations, for Chinese diplomacy al
ways says "no." but afterward always
say. "ye*."
The Archbishop Justified the ransacking
cf Peking shops for food by Chinese
Christians with the connivance of the
Archbishop. He declares the Christians
took provisions from abandoned ware
houses after they first obtained permis
eion from the French Minister to seize
previsions, clothes and coal, and also a
portion of the money lying in Prince Li's
palace, in order to send it to the dis
1 reused Christians In the provinces.
Saving the Inmates.
all in her power to sa\e the children and
nurses.
When the firemen' arrived their atten
tion was first turned to the Inmates cf
the hospital ward in the west wing of the
institution. On the floor next to the torÂ»
was Miss Brad. With the flames leaping
all around her It seemed impossible to
escape. She did. however, but was so si
riously injured by falling that she will
not live.
It was stated by th9 matron that thero
were seventy-flve girls In the west win?.
Besides these, there were two children
and two nurses in the hospital depart
ment, which was also in that wins:. It
was estimated at 8 o'clock that aJl of the
Inmates of the west wine had been gotten
out, either dead or alive.
Many children were taken away early,
and the number saved and those killed
and Injured could be counted only with
great difficulty.
The work of rescue was taken up by
volunteers as -well as by firemen. Am
bulances from all the hospitals were on
the ground almost as soon as the flra
companies, and houses In the neighbor
hood were thrown open to receive the
little ones, who were carried from the
asylum.
Bescued by Brave Firemen.
Two young men, W. Clark and F.
Young, were coming down Plymouth ave
nue at 1 o'clock this morning, when they
saw smoke issuing from the asylum.
Clark immediately ran to a fire-alarm
box and sent in an alarm. Then he and
his companion ran up the fire-escape to
the roof of the building farthest away
from the fire. Just as they reached tha
top a terrific explosion was heard and
the flames burst forth with renewed
vigor. In a few minutes half of the build
ing in which the hospital was situated
was a mass of flames. The smoke poured
out from every window and frantic cries
could be heard coming from the impris
oned Inmates. The long ladders were run
up. and. plunging into the stifling smoke,
fireman after fireman came sliding down
the ladders bearing: Inanimate forms In
their arms. Most of the children and
adults carried from the burning building
were unconscious. ;â¢ '.â¢
Falls "With the Wojnan.
Fireman Morris Keating went up on the
roof on a ladder to rescue women and
children. Just as he reached the top a
stream of water was turned on him to
keep away the flames, but It had the ef
fect to confuse the man. He reached for
a woman and the latter Jumped for his
arms. Suddenly the man lost his hold on
the ladder. The crowd groaned as thÂ«
fireman fell with the woman to thÂ»
ground. The woman, was killed out
right and the fireman was so seriously
Injured that he may die.
Children Carried Down.
Miss F. M. HIbbard, who had charge
of twenty-three children on the third
floor of the main building, said:
"I was awakened by the cries or the
children and realized that the building
was on fire. As quickly as possible we
all made our way to the roof, escape In
any other direction belngr Impossible.. Al
ready the firemen had their ladders to the
roof and quickly the children were carried
down. After most of them bad been
rescued the beat became so Intense that,
to save myself, I slid down a post lead
ing to the ground."
Miss HIbbard was terribly burned.
SECOND FATAL FIRE.
Two Men Meet Death Fighting Flames
in Kodak Works.
ROCHESTER, N. T., Jan. 8.â The ni
trate building of the Eastman Kodak
Works was destroyed by fire to-day. Two
firemen were killed by the rumes of the
burning chemicals and one other was so
seriously Injured ha probably will die.
The dead:
LIEUTENANT EDWARD MURPHY.
GEORGE P. LONG.
The injured:
George Kltlinser.
The fire started by the contact of escap
ing nitric acid with the wooden floor.
The . explosion . which occurred, though
violent, did . not . awaken the sleeping
children or nurses, but the smoke that
began to pour into the east wing brought
the inmates to a' realization of the situa
tion with a suddenness which at once
seemed to rob nearly every one, of Judg
ment and , mental faculties. Cries and
groans filled Â¦ the air.' It was impossible
to see : any thing on account of the thick,
smoke. The nurse, Miss Ashdown, did
In the east wing were the sleeping
apartments, located mainly on the second
and third floors. The lower floor was
known as the first nursery, and the upper
as the second. Here were forty children
or -more. Miss Sarah Ashdown was !n
charge -for the night, and with" her was
Miss Brad of the hospital ward, who wa3
taking care of two sick children.
Shortly after the fire broke out a boiler
exploded with terrific force, completely
blowing out the lower part of the we3t
end of the connecting wing, thereby cut
ting oft the escape '' of the children from
the east end of tb* buildlnff.
A few minutes after 1 o'clock this morn
ing a nurse. Miss Cltue. . smelled smoke.
The matter was immediately reported to
the matron. Miss I* Dlnehart. The smoke
was locateS In the boiler room, and word
was sent to police headquarters. Fire ap
paratus was hurried to the building, but
before the first engine arrived the struc
ture was In flames, and scores of persons
were doing their best to rescue the in
mates.
Terrific Boiler Explosion.
The ambulances from every hospital in
the city reached the scene almost as soon
as. the Fire Department. "but they proved
totally Inadequate In providing fcr the res
cued. Many sufferers were removed to
the houses in the Immediate neighborhood.
There were awful scenes around the asy
lum at this time. Most of those rescued
from the building were unconscious from
the effects of the amoke. It soon became
apparent that the building was doomed. A
general alarm was sent in and the entire
Fire Department was soon upon the scene.
The fire was stubbornly fought from every
available point, but it was more than an
hour after its discovery before it was
under control. .
The scene following almost Immediately
upon the discovery of the fire and the ac
companying explosion was one which
turned the stoutest hearts. The 'windows
of the west wing were filled with terrified
faces of the tiny waifs. "Working like men
possessed, the firemen struggled to release
them from their perilous position. The
rooms of the dormitory were filled with
the smoke of the fire and the little ones
were being slowly suffocated. Most of
those rescued were lowered to the ground
by means of ladders from the second and
third stories.
Terrified "Waifs at Windows.
That so many children were saved from
the west wing "of the building seems little
short of miraculous, and when the ruins
were visited to-day one marveled that the
death roll was not even larger.
ROCHESTER, ' Jan. 8.âTwenty
eight dead bodies lie at the
Morgue and twelve persons moro
or less seriously Injured lie In
the hospitals of the city to-night
as the resul: of the terrible fire which oc
curred early this morning at the Roches
ter Orphan Asylum. Of the dead twenty
six were children of both sexes, ranging
in age from 2 to 14 years, and the remain
ing two were adults. The fire, which was
discovered at 1:10 a. m. and was doubtless
caused by an explosion of natural gas In
the boiler-room adjoining the west wing
of the asylum, spread so rapidly that
many of the 109 Inmates of the institution
were overcome by flames and smoke al
most without warning.
In all the long and dismal record of
fatal fires in Rochester none can be found
which can equal this one In horror, pathe
tic - scenes in which so many lives were
blotted out In the gallant sacrifice of lives
of the attendants in whose charge the
children were and In the sad scenes of th â¢
hospital and the Morgue.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO. Jan. S.-Whatever
ripple of excitement may have
been caused in this city over
the opening of the Legislature
has passed away. The streets
have lest their unusual crowds, the hotel
lobbies have relapsed into their ordinary
routine of visitors ccmirg and going and
the assembled legislators have settled
down to the general, serious v.'orlt of the
session. Both houses are fully organized,
with the exception cf the formal an
r.cunerTRent of the various committees.
Lieutenant Governor Neff declares that he
will appoint the Senate committees to
morrow, and Spealier Pendleton believes
that on Friday morninR he will announce
his temmittet: selections, for the lower
house. Ap far as nubile interest is con
cerned the personnel of these committees
will not be differer.T in any material par
ticular from that alrcad;- annourced in
The Call. Pendleton is simply striving to
satisfy the various interests which sup
ported him.
The most sirmiflcant incident in the pro
ceedings to-duy was the presentation of
the message of Governor Gage. The fa
tality which attends every official act of
the Governor presided at this important
Incident in his official career. The mes
sage should have been presented simulta
neously in both houses. In courtesy the
Assembly should have listened to the
reading of a part of It, and should then
have ordered the entire document printed
for distribution. The Senate, according
to custom, should have listened patiently
to the reading of the whole document.
But a series of blunders attended the
affair. The message was presented in the
Assembly, and Anderson moved that the
reading be suspended. It was thought
that Anderson, knowing that Gage had
used his influence against him in the
Speakership fight, sought to commit- an
act of discourtesy. A short conference
was held, it was explained that no such
thing was intended, and the message was
received without being read. In the
meantime the Governor's messenger was
hastening on his way to the Senate
chamber with another copy of the mes
sage. Just as he reached the door the
Senate adjourned and the message was
not presented. In this way it happens
that the message of Governor Gage be
comes a public document without a word
of It having been heard by any member
of the Leglslatvre. But the Senate will
listen to it to-morrow. . .
One of the measures of more than or
dinary importance adopted by the upper
house to-day Is a request upon the proper
Federal authorities to remove United
States Quarantine Officer Kinyoun from
<3uty on the Pacific Coast. This, taken
In conjunction with a large part of the
Governor** message on the same subject,
shows veiy clearly what the State gov
ernment thinks of Klnyoun's pernicious
activity In the creation of plague scares
and similar sensational nonsense.
In connection with the Legislature now
In session there will be early next week
a meeting of the State Board of Equaliza
tion, which will be of grave Importance.
It is estimated that the Btate rate of
taxation will be smaller this year thaw
before, because of a material increase In
the assessment values of taxable property
in the State. It is announced that Ban
Francisco and Los Angeles will be torced
to bear the greater part of this Increased
burden. Because of the fact that the
Federal Government has expended $100,
000,000 in San Francisco since the begin
ning of the war with Spain the metropo
lis, it is said, will be made to bear higher
burdens of State taxation. The Board of
Equalization will meet In order that It
may reach an approximate total of prop
erty assessment in the State and give this
estimate to the Finance Committee of the
Senate and the Ways and Means Commit
tee of the Assembly.
Another Important and highly Interest-
Ing meeting will be held on Monday, when
the Electoral College of California will
assemble and cast its nine ballots for
President of the United States. This pro
ceeding will be dignified In the Assembly
chamber with music, speeches and cere
monies more ambitious than ever before
held in : the State on a similar occasion.

lots to Washington.

has been given to the Government and
the insurgent forces of Colombia, and will
be repeated tf necessity arises, that a
bombardment of that city will not be per
mitted. To aid the American Consul Gen

The revolution In Colombia is again se
rious. Acting Secretary Hill received a
dispatch to-day from Consul General
Gudger, stating that the Colombian Gov
ernment announces that the revolution
ary forces are approaching Panama and
| are making preparations for a battle,
which may soon occur.
According to a treaty arrangement with
Colombia, the United States has been
given a certain measure of protection
over the peaceful conduct of this traffic
across the isthmus. When Consul Gen
eral Gudgrer a few months ago reported
J that the revolutionists would bombard
the city of Panama. Acting Secretary of
State Hill promptly sent a dispatch to Mr.
Gudg-er announcing with unusual vigor
that this Government would not tolerate
any action likely to Interfere with the
rights whlch_the United States Govern
ment'bad assumed. ~ The dispatch became
public In Panama and had the effect of
putting an end to the plans of bombard
ment. Mr. Gudger's present dispatch
does not Indicate that the city itself is
about to be attacked, but if it develops
by later information that there Is any
prospect of bombardment, the vigorous

illegal .by a decision rendered June 15, l90t>.
In the course of -this decision the eminent Judg?
observed, as follows: '.'If "it were within the
province of this court . to decide the point. I
should hold that there is not and never. has
been â¢ case of plague in this city.".
Upon the day following, the decision of thn
NO CASE OF PLAQXTE V
EVER EXISTED HERE
"Tenthâ That the medical gentlemen and ex
perts of the city Board of Health and the
Federal quarantine officers who have ventured
the injurious opinions which have spread
broadcast over the world the rumor of the ex-'
lstence of the dreadful plague In the great and
healthful city of San Francisco have never
seen a living case of plague; whereas, some
among the physicians, surgeons and scientists
with whom I have advised have had personal
experience and wide opportunities in observ
ing the bubonic plague when It was raging In
India and elsewhere and they all pronounce
the 6Ufipected cases here not bubonic plague.
"Eleventh â From the best light I have been
able to procure and from a most careful con
sideration of the whole subject I am pleased
to Inform your Excellency that I firmly believe
no case of bubonic plague has at any time
existed within the borders of our Btate.
That If the cases referred to were
genuine plague even then the quarantine aa
conducted by the city Board of Health In con
junction with the Federal quarantine officer is
discriminating against the Chinese and also
unreasonable, according to Information derived
from the highest authority here obtainable.
"Thirteenth^ â It Is undetermined by the court
whether the Injunction referred to has been
violated.
"Fourteenthâ Since the report to your Excel
lency Involves, among other things, the ques
tion whether there Is plague In Chinatown and
also vitally touches the commercial and other
Interests of San Francisco, as well as deeply
concerns the welfare of the entire State, I
have deemed it my duty to call into consulta
tion distinguished physicians, surgeons and
bacteriologists, able financiers and business
men and others, ' eÂ« well â¢ as my eminent pre
decessor In office, the Hon. James II. Budd,
some of whose names are therefore In concur
rence hereto attached. HENRY T. GA.GE."
"We concur In the foregoing conclusion that
bubonic plague does not exist and has not
existed within the State of California.

Many other eminent bacteriologists and phy
sicians whose names are not attached to sal \
report participated in this most Important In
vestigation, reached similar conclusions,- and
concurred In the findings of the foregoing tele-
Bram -. ; ."V
"Ninthâ That no two persons of the same
family have contracted the disease and that
no two cases have occurred within the same
house or building, no matter how great the
exposure may have been.
"Eighthâ That I cannot find proof that the
plague alleged to be here is either Infectious
or contagious. I find no proof that any person
has contracted It from another; and I further
find that certain individuals who have been
repeatedly exposed at autopsies and elsewhere
to the alleged plague and others who have
moved about In the houses and rooms where
the suspects expired, having done so without
taking any precaution whatever against the
supposed malady, have neither contracted the
same nor spread , the dUease elsewhere.
"Seventhâ That the municipal records show
the proportion of deaths in Chinatown has
been no greater than that of any other portion
of San. Francisco since the date of the dis
covery of the alleged plague In Chinatown.
Vicflni was alive, nor by the attending phy
sician after death. In some of the suspected
cases death has occurred when no regular phy
sician was in attendance. There have been in
all only eleven suspected cases among a popu
lation of 85.000 Chinese (15,000 of whom are
quarantined), and no cases among whites and
other races. The examinations made after
death of the bodies of the suspected cases
since the alleged discovery of the disease mora
than three months ago fall to furnish satis
factory proof of plague.
â¢'Second â That the. quarantined district con
tains upward of 15,000 Chinese subjects, 3500
of whom are unable to support themselves by
virtue of the quarantine.
"Thirdâ That full and fair Investigation has
been dented the physlciana of the Chinese by
the city Board of Health.
"Fourthâ That the Chinese were forced to
appeal to the courts ard then were accorded
the right cf Investigation Into the cause of
death of the dead suspects. .
"Fifth â That since the procurement of the
order of court granting privilege to the white
physicians of the quarantined Chinese to visit
the sick and be present and take part in autop
sies had, neither the city Board of Health nor
Federal officers have been able to discover any
bubonic plague case. <iead or alive.
"Sixthâ That there has been no epidemlo In
Chinatown.
The awful nature of this disease and the
necessity for the State taking all precautions
against its importation" will be appreciated from
the following excerpts from the pamphlet on
"The Bubonic Plague." written by Dr. Walter
Wyman. surgeon general of the United States
Marine Hospital Service (the superior officer of
Dr. Klnyoun), ; and published at- Washington
by the Government printing office, â¢ Dr. Wy
rhan says: Â« . .
-The deadlly character of the bubonic plague
germs Is such ' that medical authorities are
agreed that such bacilli are transmissible, not
only by secretions, and excretions, but also
frcm man to man, from animals. Insects and
from objects, as well as from the soil. -
PREVENT IMPORTATION
OF PLAGUE BACILLI
Assuming that we arÂ« fully Justified in be
lieving that the | false reports of the plague
which were temporarily credited at Washing
ton, In other States and In foreis-n countries,
were Innocently circulated, may wo not have
cause to think that in certain Instances, when
prosecuting scientific investigations within this
State, with all sorts of slides, cultures, etc.,
for the purposes of discovery and comparison, .
some investigator innocently caused slides anl
cultures containing Genuine Imported bacilli
to be accidentally mixed with or substituted
for harmless slides and cultures prepared from
human .suspects, and in that way the medical
departments In Washlneton as well as In this
State were deceived and induced to foster the
false reports?
I persQnallj' know, with respect to some of
the same subjects, officially reported as plague-
Btrlcken. that where lymph was taken from
such subjects under my direction and most
carefully watched and handled, no such results
were produced under the microscope or upon
animals as those reported by Dr. Klnyoun.
When this Federal Quarantine Officer reported
that his Inoculated animals died of plague,
those Inoculated under my direction fattened
and thrived.
In the glands which were taken during my
Investigation for experiment and examination,
extreme care wu taken ro guard against tam
pering, and to prevent them from being mixed
with imported slides aivd cultures. .
Under such circumstances would It not be
fair and Just to assume that by accident some
one erred In the selection of slides and cul
tures if such results as those reported by Dr.
Klnyoun were, In truth obtained? But at all
events It must be remembered that Dr. Kln
youn, who has been so persistently obstinate
in his reports of plague, never had any expe
rience with the disease proper, his experience
being derived wholly from books and laboratory
work and not Â¦ from - practice among victims of
the plague, as was stated In my report above
set forth to his Excellency John Hay, '
Notwithstanding some official and private ro
ports to the contrary, I am still convinced thnt
up to this time no case of bubonic plague has
existed in this State; and with ordinary vigi
lance of the Federal Quarantine Officers to pre
vent lls Importation, from foreign countries,
none will In the State, unless through tho
criminal negligence or connivance of those who
might possess genuine- . imported bacilli, anl
who would be Interested in planting:, the dread
disease in our midst.
The false reports of the existence of tho
plague and the unjURt quarantjne of the State
Irreparably Injured many of our business Inter
ests and numerous industries of the State.
Travel was stopped to California, "and vlsltln.j
tourists made haste to leave our State. Th<V
prices of California frulta and cereals shrunk,
and in the markets of other States this placard
was observable: "No California Fruits for
Sale." Our commodities were for sale at a
discount In foreign markets, and the reputa
tion of this State as a Mecca for health seekerj
has been blackened for years to come. .â¢Â¦
It Is unnecessary to go further into details of
cur Injuries as a people.Mn view of our widely
known bitter experience.
Although our creat and Just President acted
elmoEt Immediately, when the Injustice of Dr.
Klnyoun and the bald certain city officials of
San Francisco was submitted to him, still prior
to the establishment of the â¢ quarantine other
States In the Union, being misled by the re
ljorts from the said ofilcials who fostered thÂ»
plague scare, quarantined against us, a course
which was followed by the republic of Mexico
and a few other foreien states. Even yet, on
account of the reports of the said city offi
cers and of Dr. Klnyoun, the State of Texas
continues an unjust quarantine against us,
checking travel and Interfering with the ship
ment of our commodities.
Circuit Court and the raising of the quaran
tine about the Chinese district. Or. J. J. Kln
youn, the Federal Quarantine Officer {who had
been previously a party to some of the Invest!-,
eatlons of those favoring the plague scare)
arbitrarily and without proper cause quaran
tined the entire State. This summary and un
justifiable action appalled >our citizens, Tho
t rult and other Industries weSw threatened with
ruin. Business was partly paralyzed. Gloom
settled over the State, and the promise of n
happy and prosperous ending of the year was
dispelled. On the night of Saturday, June 16,
1M0, the date of the arbitrary Quarantine of
Dr. Klnyoun, I telegraphed the President ap
pealing In behalf of the people of the State
to release the quarantine, and I referred for
the facts to my previous report to the Unltcl
states Secretary of State. Appeals to the Presl
ldent were also made by the Republican State
Central Committee and by its officers, and by
many diEtinguiehed citizens Irrespective of
party, while the members of the California Re
publican delegation to 'he Republican National
Convention personally palled upon the Presi
dent at AVaxhlneton making similar appeals.
The President being sufficiently advised of
the true condition of affairs, acted promptly,
and on Monday. . June IS. 1900, he communicated
with the Secretary of the Treasury, bo that
United States Surgeon General W'-man was Jl
rected to order a release of the State quaran
tine, which was done at once.
The paramount concern of the State of Cali
fornia for the sanitary, condition of the people
may -be observed from the great damage done
to ' the business and Industries of the State
through the recent false reports of the exlst
erce of plague. The merchants,' business men,
producers. >, manufacturers, farmers . and fruit
growers throughout the State who suffered ex
tremely on account of the. unreliable reports of
reckless persons concerning the appearance of
plague In the city of San Franclsc*. will agree
that there Is an Immediate necessity for Â«thÂ«
passage of rigid laws giving within this State
Jurisdiction to the State Board of -Health over
all- local Boards of Health In the matter of
quarantine regulations, and the supervision and
direction over : nil' bubonic plague; cases- or
plague suspects. .The falsity of the ; report " of
EXTENSION OF POWERS
OF BO ABD OF HEALTH
"In the Christian era It Is not until the
sixth century that we find bubonic plague in
Europe. In E42 it spread over Egypt, and
passed to Constantinople, where It carried off
1P.000 persons in one day, and in the same cen
tury appeared in Italy, and extended also along
the northern coast of Africa. It prevailed In
England In the seventh century. In the four
teenth century it was Introduced from the East
and . prevailed throughout Armenia, Asia
Minor, Egypt, Northern Africa and nearly the
whole of Europe. Hecker calculates that one
fourth the population of Europe, or 25.000,000
persons, died in all of the epidemics in the
fourteenth century. It was In this century that
the first .measures were taken to check the
spread of the plague, Venice appointing In 1348
three guardians of the public health for this
purpose. In the fifteenth century It recurred
frequently in nearly all parts of Europe, in
one year (1466) the mortality reaching 40,000.
The first quarantine establishment was found
ed in this century, namely, at Venice, In 1403,
on a small Island adjoining the city. The six
teenth century waa not more free from plague
than the fifteenth. In 1572 50,000 died at Lyons.
In 1576 Venice lost 70.000. In the seventeenth
century it still prevailed In Europe, though
less widely than In the middle ages. In 1656
one of the most destructive of all recorded epi
demics raged at Naples. It is said to have
curried off 300,000 lti a period of five months.
The great plague of London was In 1664 and
1B65. The total number of deaths in 1S65, ac
cording to the bills of mortality, was 6S.&?6 in
an estimated population of 460,000. out of whom
two-thirds are supposed to have fled to escape
contagion. In the eighteenth century it pre
vailed extensively In Europe, the most notable
epidemic being In Marseilles (1720). when irom
40,000 to 60,000 persons were carried off. In
1721 it appeared at Toulon and spread over
Provence, and out of a population of 230,000 per
sons S7.6.-.9 are said 'o have died. Sicily was
visited In 1743. namely, at Messina, when the
mortality waa between 40,000 and 60,000. In
1771 It broke out In Moscow, and more than
60.000 persons, nearly one-quarter of the popu
lation, were carried off."
Again on page â¢ 6 of the pamphlet. Dr. Wy
nian. speaking of the appearance of the plague
subsequent to 1S93, observes:
"Through the channels as detailed above has
resulted an epidemic outbreak which in Bom
bay (presidency) alone has resulted In 2:0,907
cases, with the enormous mortality of 164.053:
li Hongkong 1600 cases. with 1541 deaths;
Amoy, within a limited period. 540 deaths; Cal
cutta, approximately, *50ft deaths, and in For
mosa. 2458 cases, with 1666 deaths."
That danger may result from the use of the
plague bacilli In scientific experiments Is evi
denced by the comment of Dr. Wyman upon
the Austrian casrs, where he says: "Cases in
Vienna, resulting from accidental Inoculation
while studying the disease in one of the lab'ora
tcrles, were controlled, and were limited to the
two original victims and a physician and a
nurse who administered to them. The same
may be recorded of a case Introduced Into
Trieste, Austria."
The importation and possession of such deadly
germs Is, therefor- fraught "irlth danger to the
people, and should be prohibited by law. Who
can tell what an unscrupulous or negligent
man, sclentlflo or otherwise, might not do
while possessing plague bacilli, and knowing
how to use the same? Why. should not the
people be protected against the Importation by
scientific men of these dangerous microbes,
as well as to be guarded by quarantine regula
tions against the victims of the disease T Con
vinced, as I am. that the actions of these per
son* who, during the recent plague scare, car
ried about with them these deadly) Imported
bacilli, were full of recklessness If not border-
Ing on criminal lines, I now urge that vigorous
laws be passed so as to prevent such actions in
the future. I recommend the passage of laws
carefully drawn relating to this subject In
substance as follows: -.
First That It be made Â¦ a felony punishable
with an extreme 'penalty of life Imprisonment
for any person, for any purpose, to Import or
bring or cause to be imported or brought into
this State or to have in his possession within
this State without the written authority of thÂ»
State Board of Health, approved by the Exec
utive any plague bacilli or plague cultures or
plague slides, and also that attempts to ac
complish tho same purpose be 1 made punish
able as ordlnarv felonies. _
Secondâ That It be made n felony punishable
with an extreme penalty of life imprisonment
for any person for any purpose, within this
State, to develop bubonic plague cultures or to
make .cultured or, slides from any plague sub
ject o> so-called plague suspect, or to take
tissue, glands or lymph from any plague sub
ject or suspect, or to otherwise operate
upon the body of any plague ! subject, or
suspect or to inoculate any animal, bird or
insect with plague bacilli, except under the
punervlslon or with the written permission of
the State Board of Health and with the ap
proval of the Executive, and that any attempt
by any person to commit any of such acts with
out such direction, supervision and approval,
bs made punishable aa ordinary felonies.

SCENE IN THE SENATE CHAMBER DURING THE READING OP THE FIRST RESOLUTION OF THE THIRTY
FOURTH SESSION. MANY OF THE MEMBERS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR WIVES, WHO HAD BEEN
GRANTED THE PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR. ' " :
"First â That no ran In Ban Francisco or
Calltornia has been diagnosed as bubonic
plague by any attendirs physician while the
"His Excellency John Hay. Secretary of
State, Washington. D. Câ Sir: In reply to
your telegram of date May 31. I have the honor
to report : -. Â¦ .
I thereupon transmitted to his Excellency
John Hay the following dispatch, which was
signed and concurred in by the distinguished
medical authorities and by the prominent cit
izens whcÂ«e names appear below, to â¢wit:
. . "SAN FRA.VCISCO, June 13, 1900.
Thereafter, upon the 13th of June, 1900, my
labors occupying weeks were completed, the
different medical views maturely considered,
and I was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt
that the bubonic plague had not been in the
Chinese quarter of Sin Francisco nor In any
other part of the city, nor In any part of the
State. \
On May 31. 1900, while In San Francisco con
ducting such Investigation. I received a dis
patch from his Excellency John Hay, Secretary
of State, at Washington, inquiring If the plague
really existed, and requesting me to report at
ah early opportunity. I - replied immediately
that I was then investigating the matter anl
would report as quickly as possible.
During the oourse of these events a few sen
sational newspaper organs, like carrion birds,
scented -the subject and boldly espoused the
cause of the plague creators, publishing dally
sensational accounts of suspected cases and
declaring them to be cases of plague. . In the
latter part of May and until about the middle
of June I e^ent some weeks In San Francisco,
ably assisted by Hon. Daniel Kevane, secre
tary of the Board of Examiners, and also by
mopt eminent local physicians and bacteriolo
frirts. as â¢well as by distinguished and level
mlnded citizen*, lrr a careful, fair and full ex
amination of the matter. After a most impar
tial examination, tn which I sought to be ap
prised of every fact from reliable sources which
would tend to throw light upon the subject. I
finally became convinced beyond doubt that the
bubonic plague did not cixlst and had not ex
isted, notwithstanding the alarming reports to
the contrary.
Could it have been possible that some dead
body of a Chinaman had innocently or other
wlt"> received a post mortem Inoculation in a
lymphatic region by some one possessing the.
imported plague bacilli, and that honest people
were thereby deluded?
Efforts were made by the said city officers to
remove the Chines* from their quarters In San
Francisco to Mission Rock, and the Chinese
Consul of Ban Francisco communicated this
attempted violation of the treaty rights to the
United Btates Secretary of Etate through the
Chinese Minister at Washington.
The- year 1900 began most prosperously for the
people of this State, -with the adjustment of the
â¢JTalrs of the different Islands won by Ameri
can valor and diplomacy from the kingdom of
Spain. The rains of the preceding winter had
allowed our farmers and fruit growers to gar
ner full crops, and the merchant and manufac
turer, owing to the free communication with
the Philippines, exhibited business activity, and
a mest profitable harvest was presaged for the
people of the State. At this most favorable
juncture for our people a fearful shadow was
cast upon our State through the recklessness
cf certain city officials of Ban Francisco, as
fclsted by a Federal officer, one Dr. Klnyoun.
Intimations were thrown out In the months
of March and April laet that the dreadful bu
bonic plague existed In the Chinese quarter of
San Francisco. Secret consultations and al
leged Investigations were had by said city of
ficials, in conjunction with the said Federal
quarantine officer, and the result of euch al
leged investigations was that the Surgeon Gen
eral of the United States Marine Hospital at
Washington was informed by some of these ill
advised persons that the terrible plague was
epidemlo in the city of Ban Francisco. There
tofore cultures and slides containing genuine
plague bacilli were Imported Into the State.
and such cultures and slides were carried by
certain physicians and others In their pockets
while rlolng In cars and stopping at hotels and
other public places.
"BUBONIC" XINYOTJN'S
COURSE DENOUNCED
Â«) that net will expire In May next year <19O2).
A convention concerning the subject of em
ipration between the United States of America
Â»nd th? emj-lre of China was concluded and
Figned l>y the respective plenipotentiaries at
the city of Washington on March 17, 1S94,
end ratifications exchanged at the same city
on December 7. 1894, by the terms of which
convention, among other things, China agreed
t<> the exclusion from the United States of
further Chinese laborers, and also assented in
direct terms to the enforcement of the pro
visions of the act of Congress of May 5, 1S92,
as amended by an act approved November 3,
1S?3. By article VI of this convention it Is
provided ae follows: "This convention shall
remain in force for a period of ten years be
ginning with the date of the exchange of rati
fications, ar.d if 6ix iiionths before the ex
piration cf said period of ten years neither
Government shall have formally given notice
cf its final termination to the other it shall
remain In full force for another like period of
ten years."
It v.iil be perceived from the above language
of article VI that the convention Is terminable
by either of the nations provided six months
notice be given before the expiration of ten
years, so that In December, 1S<H, there Is a
pofsibllity of this convention being terminated
by the action of China. *5ut there Is another
feature of the convention which may require
action on the part of the United States be
fore the expiration of the period limfted which
might require a revision of Its terms.
Article I of the said convention reads as fol
lows: "The high contracting parties agree that
for a period of ten years, beginning with the
date of the exchange of ratifications of this
convention, the coming, except under the con
ditions hereinafter specified, of Chinese labor
ers to the United States 6hall be absolutely pro
hibited."
Since December 7, 1S94, the date of the ex
change of ratifications, we have acquired addi
tional territory, both by annexation and war.
Questions of the rights and privileges of sub
jects of China while In the Philippines and the
other Islands acquired from Spain may arise
and contentions by the Chinese diplomats are
possible that Inasmuch as the contracting par
ties had not in view future territory conquered
or acquired by the United States of America,
but only the United States as then bounded and
known, and that when the United States ae-
Eumed the sovereignty which Spain abdicated
in its favor, this republic took that territory
subject to the obligations which Spain owed
to the empire of China. Whether this possible
pie* be epecious or not. It at least mipht pave
the way for International discussion. To ..avoid
all <tue*tions. therefore, acts of Congress are
necessary to be passed In order to afford pro
tection to American labor, and the convention
with China should be so revised as to cover be
yond all question every part of the territory of
the United States.
The peril from Chinese labor finds a similar
danger In the unrestricted Importation of Jap
anese laborers. The cheapness of that labor is
likewise a menace to American labor, and a
new treaty with Japan for euch restriction as
well as the passage of laws by Congress Is
desired for the protection of Americans.
I therefore most earnestly appeal to your
honorable bodies for the passage aÂ» a matter
of urgency of appropriate resolutions instruct
ing our Senators andr requesting our Represen
tatives In Congress for the immediate institu
tion of all proper measures leading to the re
vision of the existing treaties with China and
Japan and the passage of all necessary laws
and resolutions for the protection of American
labor against the immigration of Oriental la
borers.
I suggest therefore that It should be declared
a felony for any person or corporation to pub
lish or procure to be published within this
State any false report cf the presence of bu
bonic plague within this State, and that it be
likewise declared a felony for any person or
corporation within this State to publish or pro
cure to be published without this State the
existence within this State of bubonic plague
The reputation for public health is a fnnÂ«t
valuable right of the Htate and of tta peoDle '
That reputation of the State for health should
not be destroyed nor the business nor Indus
tries- of. its citizens Interrupted nor impaired
through. the malicious pen of a scribbler writ
ing either for profit or sensation.
Reputation for public health Is connected
closely with public safety and -with the en
Joyment by the citizens, of their private urot>
erty and the care and maintenance of thit
public health is within the sovereign now.â¢
of the State. â¢ powers
The passage of such laws will not bfe re
pressive of -the liberty of the press.
We have a law now on our statute books en
titled "An act to protect stockholders and per
sons dealing with corporations in this State"
(approved March 20, 1878,), declaring as a fel
ony the making and publication of falsÂ» re
ports respecting the value of stocks sold in
the market. Such a 'vrong, puntnhable under
such act. only- affects a limited number of In
dividuals, while the circulation and publication
of false reports respÂ«.?t!njr the public health
tends to the destruction of all the interests of
all the people of the State.
The recent false press reports respecting the
existence of bubonic plafrue within this state
stopped for a time travel to this State and
ruined Mich property of. our citizens and Im
periled our Industries, and immediate legisla
tion Is needed to prevent a recurrence of these
vicious publications.'
It Is an extremely regrettable fact that the
Injury to the business and industries of the
Etate was largely Increased through false and
senaatlonal pictures and writings of a very
few newspaper organs, managed and edited by
those who certainly had not at heart the wel
fare of the State above their own selfish In
terests. The circulation of such untrustworthy
publications disseminated the plague scare
broadcast and wrought much of the Injury
which the people of the State have sustained.
No Btate should permit such an outrage to
be committed against its citizens by any man,
eet of men or corporation. I believe In a free
but not in a licentious press. I believe In just
public criticism by th9 press of public officers
and In proper and just warnings by tha press
of public and prtvate dangers, whether from
disease or otherwise. I would not devtre. were
It possible under our constitution and laws,
fcr a censorship to bo established over the
press notwithstanding some abuses. I atn
however, . firmly of the opinion that legislation
Is necessary to protect the people in the con
duct of their business and the sale of their
products and commodities. Such acts, causing
great wroÂ»gs to the State by an individual or
a cori>oratlon. should l.e declared crUnlnal and
severe punishment shouM be meted out to such
offenders.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION
AGAINST FALSE REPORTS
I recommend that all appropriate laws to
protect the State from this dread disease should
be enacted.
I recommend that it be made the duty cf
the State Board of Health, upon receiving such
report, to Immediately Investigate or take
charge of such case, or depute or authorize
some physician to lriysstlgate and take charge
of such case, and In the event of death that
a member of said Stare Board of Health or
physician delegated by said board be present
at the autopsy. Upon the verification by the
State Board of Health of any case of reported
plague It should be marie tha duty of such
State Board of Health to imrrtedlately notify
all local boards of health in the Sta^ and also
notify by telegraph the United States Treasury
Department at Washington â¢ and the State
beards of health of all the States of the Union.
I recommend further that it be made the
duty of every city, county and State officer,
phyMclan or other person having knowledge of
the existence of any case of plague or sus
pected case of plague, within the State, to re
port the same at once to the State Board of
IK-alth or to the Sheriff or Coroner of the
county, and that It be made the duty of such
Sheriff or Coroner to Immediately report sucli
Information to the State Board of Health.
Refusal or neglect to perform such should,

I further recommend the passage of a law
preventing the landing at any of the State,
city and county, city or town bulkheads or
breakwaters of any vessel arriving from any
other State or from, a foreign country at any
port, sub-port or harbor of the State without
a certificate of health first obtained from the
paid State quarantine officer at the port of
San Francisco, or from the State Board of
Health, or from an officer duly authorized in
writing by the State Board of Health.
It might be well, perhaps, that an act bo
passed providing for the establishment of :i
laboratory for bacteriological and experimental
purposes, f&r the use of the State Board of
Health, and that an adequate appropriation be
made therefor.
In view of the fact that by reason of the
powers vested In the city Board of Health by
the charter of San Francisco, the legality of
the office of State quarantine officer to such
city under the ect has been disputed. I recom
mend that a law be passed repealing said act,
and creating the office of State quarantine
officer, to be vested with State quarantine
powers, and to perform his duties under the
supervision of the State Board of Health, such
officer to be stationed at the port of San
Francisco. I recomtaend a moderate appropria
tion for the payment of euch officer's services
and expenses. I further recommend that full
power be given the State Board of Health for
the establishment and enforcement of all rea
sonable rules and regulations lor a quarantine
of the State and Its waters.
the existence of plague In this State having
been made manifest to the Tresldent, who
caused the removal of the qu?.rantlne. Justi
fies the State iiÂ» attributing lncompetency tu
the Federal quarantine officer stationed in this
btate. Even had the reports of that of fleer been
well founded, which they were not. it still
justifieg the State In assuming that It. was due
to that Federal officer's incompetency in fail-
Ing to properly quarantine the State that sus
pected caseB of plague were reported.
The time, therefore, has arrived for the
State to protect Its people, their business.. and
their Industries against reported bubonic
plague cases or plafrue. suspects. I recommend,
therefore, the extension of the powers and
duties of the State Board of Health so that
Its dignity may be rarÂ»ed In proportion to its
Importance, and that the most eminent physi
cians may be proud of occupying a place in
the board, or acting under Its supervision and
direction. I recommend that in the matter
of bubonic plague cases or plague suspects, as
well as in all other dangerous, epidemic, con
tagious and infectious diseases, the State Board
of Health have for State purposes full control
and supervision of all county, city and county
city and town Boards of Health and medical
officers, with a right to demand at all times
a report from such boards and officers re
specting epidemic, contagious and Infectious
diseases^
I further recommend that a refusal or neg-Â»
lect by 6uch officers to so report to the State
Hoard of Health be- declared a felony, and
punishable as such.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
In January, iroo, after veTy Mature consld
eratic n of the many reasons then existing fcr
reconvening the Legislature, I called an ex
traordinary .Â«ession.
The legislators, actuated by patriotic mo
tives, vied with each other in rapid, efficient
and economic work.
Among other principal matters for which th-i
legislature was convened was to pass enahlin.:
laws in aid of the State Harbor Commissurn
ers of San Francisco by amending section^
2.">24 and 2327 of the Political Code of this Stau.
As section 2J24 previously stood, the lensrth Â¦ â¢'
wharves at San Francisco could not escee I
six hundred feet from the bulkhead line. ai..t
this limitation was not adanted to the tare
modern ships arriving in the harbor. Th*
wharfage facilities of San Franc. sco were in
sufficient to accommodate the great number <?
vessels already in port in M3Â», and. as th? year
1300 promised a great increase in shipping, it
became a matter of necessity to provide in ad
vance for that emergency.
Many merchants and commercial associa
tions of San Francisco, iiaving the interests â¢Â¦'.
the State aa well as that city at heart. Viewed
with alarm the limited harbor accommodation*
to meet the constantly increasing demand Of
the shipping Interests of that great and nour
ishing city, and urged me to call an extra ses
sion of the Legislature To afford relief in lr-*
premise*. Among 1 them, the Narth Central Im
provement Association of San Francisco, com
poeed of active business men of advanced views
upon the subject of the commercial needs M
the State, addressed to me a strong petition
signed by numerous enerzetle and public-spir
ited citizens, requesting an extraordinary sta
tion, in order to afford lhe much-needed relief,
while the State Harbor Commissioners (a Â».i-
Jority of whom are Democratic), together witJi
my able and distlnguisafed Democratic prede
cessor. Hon. James H. Budd. filed a petition
on December 13. 1833. for an extraordinary sec
tion stating the Immediate necessity of amend
ing said sections 2521 and 2527 of the Political
Code. In order to accommodate tha Increased
tonnage arriving at the port.
The Legislature in the extra session of 1300
passed tha principal measures for the relief
of the harbor of San Francisco recommended
In my proclamation, so that under the present
law with tha approval of the Federal authori
ties. State wharves and piers may now extend
cut a distance of about eight hundred feet from
the bulkhead line, which, when completed, will
accommodate the largest ships afloat. The
Board of State Harbor Commissioners, after
the passage of the law, prepared a contour map
for the establishment of a new harbor pier
head line which was by me forwarded to- tha
United States War Decartment at Washing
ton with the request that the new extended
pierhead line be established in place of tha:
previously existing. ThU request was referred
to a board of United States army engineers,
which board recently met in San Francisco,
and, after due advertisement, made a favorable
report to the War Department.
Upon th* 10th day of December. 1300. I re
ceived official notice that the Honorable ih*
Secretary of War had ai>croved an! confirm* 1
the extension of the piernead line Into the bav
of Saa Francisco from Von Ness avenue It
Folsom street.
By the amendment t.> section 2-27 of the Po
litical Code aUo passed at the said extra ses
sion the Board of Harbor Commissioners, in
stead of being limited for the purpose of Im
provements to the u?e of their revenue for om

be deemed best by said commissioners. By th.s

may continually improve the harbor, without

IMPROVEMENT OF SAN
FRANCISCO'S HARBOR
Judge Cooler, in h!s admirable work on con
stitutional limitations, thus defines that liberty,
page US (sixth edition):
"Th* constitutional liberty of speech and of
the pre^s. an we under3tand It. Implies a right
to freely utter and publish whatever the citizen
may please, and to b* protected agatnst any
responsibility for so doing, exrept so far an
such publications, from their blasphemy, ob
scenity or scandalous character, may be &
public offense, or as by their falsehood and
malice they may injuriously affect the staniU
lr.g, reputation or pecuniary interests of In
dividual.". Or. to slat? the same thing la
somewhat different words, we understand lib
erty of speech and oftt-.c press to imply not
only liberty to publish, but complete Immunity
frcm legal censure and punishment for the
publication, so long as It is not harmful in
Its character, Â¦when tested by such standard*
as the law afford*. For these standards mm
nut; look to the cwvmon law rules which
were In force when the constitutional guaran
ties were established and in reference to which
they have been adopted."
Again the same learned author. â¢ on page*
SIS and S17 of the sin* work, thus expresses
the law: "It is conceded on all sJBes that the
common law rules thai subjected the Hbeler to
responsibility for the private injury, or the
public scandal or disorder occasioned by hla
conduct, are not abolished by the protection
extended to the press In our constitutions."
The common law afforded full protection
against malicious and seditious libels and pub
lications, and wher<Â» the public health and
public safety In liable to be assailed by evil
Â¦ nd designing persons laws should be passe, l
for the protection of thÂ» people in this rÂ»i?ar<1.
The people cannot permit their business an. I
industries to be checki-d. Injured or destroyed
at the mere whim and caprice of a private
person or private corporation conducting Â» a
newspaper, which Is capable of dissemlnatlns
far and wide malicious or false reports re

GOVERNOR GAGE'S BIENNIAL MESSAGE TO THE LEGISLATURE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIit, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1901.
2CARTOONIST WARREN'S SNAPSHOTS OF FAMILIAR FIGURES AT THE CAPITAL.
At the extra session of 1900 I asked the Legis
lature for ,the power of removal In cases of
malversation In office, which my predecessor
had likewise requested. In order that such
abuses might be rectified; but the Legislature
then deemed It unwise to vest in the executive
of this State such power, although much
greater power In respect to such matters ha*
been eranted to the Mayor of San Francisco
and the Mayors of other cities in this State.
In the management of the State Board of
Pharmacy and the State Board of Dental Ex
aminers scandals have been bruited, and ap*
peals made to me for redress; but Inasmuch
as I am deprived of all power in the premise?
such npiwals are both Idle and useless. As
a result of these scandals, the said boards
are In a lamentable condition, and their ef
ficiency is practically destroyed.
The members of these boards (with one ex
ception In the State Dental Board) were ap
pointed'prior to my Induction Into office. '
Now It must be remembered, owing to the
exceedingly limited powers of the Governor,
that neither my own appointees nor those of
my predecessors holding for terms are subject
to removal or change.
SCANDAXS OT BENTAI.
AND PHARMACY BOARDS
In view of the recent report before you of the
former management It Is unnecessary at this
time to detail the work heretofore done in this
Important reform school.
All State institutions appear to bo efficiently
and satisfactorily managed, with a few excep
tions where the control and supervision Is not
vested in this administration.
laws valid tests and conditions. In view of the
clearly expressed 'will of the people It becomes
yvur duty unc'.er \he said constitutional amend
ment to pass reasonable laws for the conduct
of primary elections, but it must be remem
bered that the State Is not absolute, so that
care should be taken that such legislation may
not contravene any of the provisions or the
United States constitution or of the Federal
laws, and such laws providing for primary
elections should be the least complex and as
inexpensive in character as is consistent with
the rights and privileges of electors.
The report of the board of trustees of the
Whlttler State School has been printed as re
quired by law and I beg leave to refer you to
a copy .of said report for the details of the pres
ent management.
Since the adjournment of the thirty-third reg
ular session, namely, on the 16th day of June.
1S99, the refectory building of the Whlttler
State School was accidentally destroyed by
fire. As none of the State Institutions except
the university and the State Printing Office are
permitted to carry Insurance, and as no part
of any money appropriated for the maintenance
of the school could, under the law, be applied
for. the reconstruction of "the burned buildings,
great inconvenience has hampered the man
agement. It Is now necessary that contracts be
let for the Immediate rebuilding of the dining
room and kitchen, and I recommend that a law
be passed appropriating a sum not to exceed
$15,000 for that purpose, which said appropria
tion should be made at once available.
1 he former superintendent. Mr. Hlrshberg.
of the lone School of Industry recently tendered

The Senate convened at 2 o'clock, adopt
ed a few resolutions and then, when Pres
ident Pro Tern. Flint called for further
business. Leavitt waited for a response,
end. hearing none, moved to adjourn un
til 2 o'ciock to-morrow. He did not think
of the message and neither did any one
else, and in another minute the Senators
Â¦were leaving the chamber. When the Gov
ernor's private secretary arrived he found
the Senate adjourned, so he carried the
message back to the Governor's office.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 8.â The short session of the
Senate to-day was noticeable principally
because of the sensational character of
Its adjournment, although It was not un
til some time after the session closed that
Jt was kr.own Just how interesting the ad
journrnetnt was. It came Just in time to
have the Senators who were flocking from
the Senate chamber mtet the Governor's
private secretary as hh was bringing the
Governor's message upstairs forjiresenta
tion to the Seriate.
Speaker Pendleton evidently feared that
the Governor would not relish such un
ceremonious treatment | of his message,
and, to gain time, he said Anderson's mo
tion.must be reduced to writing. While
Anderson was writing -it out Pendleton
called Johnson to the chair and told him
his fears. Johnson hurried back, to An
derson, asking the chief clerk to defer
for a moment the; reading of Anderson's
motion, and after -consulting the ex-
Treadwell of San Francisco moved that
the reading' of the message be dispensed
with, and that it be ordered printed in
the Journal. Speaker Pendleton , showed
his desire that such action should not
be taken, and Treadwell withdrew his mo
tion and moved that the message bo
heard. Tho reading, had just begun when
Alden Anderson interrupted to movo that
the reading be dispensed with, and that
600 copies of the i message be printed In
the ' Journal. Johnson suggested 1000
copies. â¢ >v'-'-t-
The committee, consisting of Anderson,
Ralston and James, appointed to inform
the Governor that the Assembly had com
pleted its organization and awaited his
communication, reported that the Gover
nor was ready to send in his message at
once. Private Secretary Foley, who had
waited at the door of the Senate Cham
ber with the voluminous message until
the more dignified house of the Legisla
ture adjourned, took no chances with the
Assembly, and presented himself in the
middle aisle at once .with the message,
which he delivered to the chief clerk.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 8.â The Assembly took an
other step to-day toward the perfection
of its organization by the appointment of
ninety-seven attaches, according to the
distribution made by the committee of the
Republican caucus. The Governor's mes
sage was received late in the afternoon,
and after an awkward byplay between
the Sneaker and several members it was
wardea off without being read, the As
sembly being content to wait for its ap
pearance to-morrow in the Journal.
There remains $72 patronage per day
yet to be distributed and a further report
of the patronage committee will be made
to the caucus to-morrow morning. ; .
Those of the newly appointed attaches
who were present were ordered to present
themselves at ; the bar of the Assembly
to be sworn In, and instantly there was a
stampede toward the front. From , every
part of the Assembly chamber men, wo
men- and boys who for the next sixty
days, more or less, will do llttleworkfor
liberal pay. crowded forward to "take the
oath required . of thc-m.
; Milice offered a' resolution urging Con
gress to pass the bill now pending which
establishes a national -quarantine against
fruit diseases and insect pests, and want
ed ! it passed immediately. The Speaker
ruled that It would , have to take the
course of a bill and referred It* to the
Committee on ; Hospitals. Health and
Quarantine. ' - "
A resolution offered by Johnson that C.
Speaker, he announced to Pendleton that
Governor Gage had expressed indifference
as to whether the message was read. The
Speaker still seemed reluctant to have the
motion carried, but he put it to a vote
and it was carried unanimously.
The work of the caucus committee had
not been completed in time for the caucus
at 1 o'clock, although, the committee had
worked at a night session until 2 o'clock
this morning and had begun again at 10
o'clock, struggling with the conflicting
patronage claims of members. In conse
quence there was little business to be
done when the Assembly convened at 2
o'clock. At 2:30 o'clock a recess was
taken to permit the completion of the
patronage apportionment.
The Assembly was called to order again
shortly after 3 o'clock and Mellck Intro
duced the resolution providing for the ap
pointment of attaches as agreed upon by
the committee. When the roll call for the
voto began It looked for a moment as if
there would be opposition from the Dem
ocratic side, i Sutro . and . Fellz were both
on feet, but the Speaker did not
recognize them and ordered the roll call
to proceed. Chiles alone voted in the
negative, 'seventy-aix votes being record

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. S.â The - really important
measures of legislation for the session
may be briefly foreshadowed. The min

their efforts to obtain an appropriation of
$150,000 to carry out the approved plans
for impounding- debris from the mines.
The State has already appropriated $230,
000 for this purpose; Congress has appro
priated a like sum, the allowance having
been made by the general Government on
the agreement that the State would sus
tain half the expense of carrying out the
plans adopted 'by the engineer corps. Now
the engineers estimate that the whole
work could be done for $300,000, and Con
gress has signified its readiness to appro
priate $150,000 in addition to the original
allowance, and. the State is asked to vote
an equal sum in addition to its former
allowance. ,

will engage the prolonged attention of tha
Legislature.
Consideration of primary election bills
and of measures to apportion the State
Into legislative and Congressional districts
will consume much time. Beyond this the
energies of the session will be devoted
mainly to killing the multitude of bad
bills which will surely be Introduced.
Assemblyman "Wright of Santa Clara
his charge of resolutions drafted by the
State Fruit Growers' Convention, which
condemn the reciprocity treaties negoti
ated by John A. Kasson and urge the Cal
ifornia Senators to oppose their ratifica
tion. He will introduce the resolutions as
soon as possible.
Wright also has two bills In the Interest
of Stanford University. One of them Is a'
brief measure conferring full corporate
powers and privileges upon the trustees of
the university. Its purpose is to supple
ment and confirm the powers granted in
the original act and particularly to enable
the university to receive bequests. The
other bill exempts the bonds held by the
university and its buildings on the campus
from taxation. The bill specifically pro
vides that all other property, real or per
sonal, held by the university, shall not be
exempted. Both of. these bills are Intro
duced as a result of the approval at tha
polls in November of the Stanford Uni
versity amendment.
Corlett will Introduce In the- Senate and
."Webber in the Assembly a bill Increasing
the allowance for the maintenance of vet
erans at the Veterans' Home of Califor
nia at YountvillÂ« from $45,000 to $60,000 per
annum. At the time the present allow
ance was made 400 veterans were cartel
for at the home. That numbÂ«r has In
creased to 735.
Senator Rowell has several code amend
ments and one new law to provide revenue
for the university. One la an increased in
heritance tax. another a fee for Incorpo
rating domestic corporations, another la a
tax on foreign ores and another provides
a $3 fee for all naturalizations. It is esti
mated roughly that these, if passed, will
add $100,000 or more to the yearly income
of the university. These bills were drawn
by a committee from the alumni associa

Senator Cutter has a bill to exempt the
buildings and bonds of Stanford Univer

"Under an act of the last Legislature, build
ings for v the Affiliated Colleges are being con
structed* In San Francisco, and as soon as a
general plan for the construction of buildings
at Berkeley can be adopted the Regents will
receive, by the donation of generous people of
the State, sufficient money to construct all the
buildings the university will need for many
years to come. The means by which to pro
cure these plans has already been donated by
that public-spirited philanthropist, Mrs. Phebe
Hearst, whose aid has heretofore been gracious
ly extended to the university; and as soon as
the plans are adopted we are assured by her
of an additional benefaction of over half a
million dollars, for the erection and mainte
nance of buildings for the use and extension of
the university." .
Since Governor Budd delivered that messag*
Mrs. Hearst has during the present administra
tion exceeded all expectations by the adoption
of plans for the university prepared upon a
magnificent and almost royal scale, and has
paid very high rewards' to several competing
architects, as well as to the designer of the ap
proved plans. The future of the university re
garding permanent Improvements Is therefore
assured by the philanthropy of this moat pub
llc-spirlted lady and Regent of the University,
and whatever may be lacking for the carrying
out of the grand ideas of Mrs. Hearst will be
gladly done at the proper time by the people
of the State through their representatives, as
occasion demands.
In view of this condition, I recommend for
the present relief of the university that the act
of February 27. 1S&7, be amended, so as to per
mit all of the revenues derived from the 1 per
cent tax to be devoted to the support and main
tenance, instead of being In part used for per
manent Improvements.
The report of the secretary Â«rf the university
recently submitted to me shows that the
amount of $54,074 37. derived from this tax for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, was under
that law devoted to the fund for the permanent
Improvement of the university.
By the adoption of the amendment now pro
posed by me the university will receive the
benefit of this sum. which would otherwise be
used for the erection of buildings and like Im
provements, '
An act was passed by the Legislature at Its
last regular session providing for the erection
and furnishing of a residence for the Governor,
but on account of the sudden rise In materials
and for other reasons specified In the report
of the State Capitol Commission, which lÂ» sub
mitted for your consideration, the erection and
furnishing of such residence was not possible,
and in view of the Immediate needs of the uni
versity and the fact that such residence Is not
a matter of urgency, I recommend that a law
be passed appropriating the balance of that
appropriation which is now In the State treas
ury, to wit. the sum of $48,758, for the support
and maintenance of the university, and the
subject of the erection of a residence for the
Governor may be considered at a future ses
sion of the Legislature, If deemed advisable.
By the adoption of these two suggestions, u

I beg leave here to quote with approval the
language of Governor Budd In his first biennial
message, dated January 4, 1S97. where, referring
to this subject, he pays a. well-merited tribute
to Airs. Hearst, as follows:

munificent donations which that most excellent
lady and public benefactress, Mrs. Phebe A.
Hearst. Is about to bestow upon the university
for this special purpose.
At the recent election the people adopted by
a large vote Senate constitutional amendment
No. 4. which vests In the Legislature the power
to enact primary laws and to embody In such
I recommend that the said law be so amend
ed, or that a new law be passed, requiring all
State boards, commissions and officers to fur
nish the State Board of Examiners with veri
fied inventories of all State property In their
keeping or under their control at least once
a year and whenever reasonably demanded by
said board, and that a willful refusal to give
such statement be declared a misdemeanor, and
that such refusal be likewise punished by for
feiture of office.
SUTTABI.E PRIMARY LAW
SHOULD BE ENACTED
The present secretary of the Board of Exam
iners prepared a notice and demand under the
terms of said act and causÂ«d the same to be
served upon all State officers, boards and com
missioners, requesting a prompt return of the
Inventory. As a result of the urgent demands
ot the said secretary, the Board of Examiners
have now a more complete record and estimate
oi the nature and value of all State property
than ever before.
This act Is very loosely drawn and requires
only that a biennial report under oath of the
Inventory of all State property In their keeping
be clVen by State officers, boards and commis
sioners, without attaching any penalty for non
performance.
Previous to the present administration no
complete record had been kept at the Capitol
Of the various classes of State property under
the control of State officers -and In the various
Institutions of the State. The act requiring
State officers to give an inventory of Â¦ State
property was approved February 9, 1897, and
Is entitled "An act to requlri? an Inventory of
State and county property and directing that a
record of the same be ker>t."
Under section 6 of article IV of the constitu
tion of this State, your honorable bodies^ are
vested with the power of fixing and adjusting

My confidence in your Integrity and fairness
permits me to predict that this duty will be
justly performed, and the matters disposed cf
upon the basis of abstract right.
I recommend the repeal of the act approved
March 8, 1S97 (Stats, 1SU7, p. 74). creating "a.

REAPPOBTIONMENT

public character. In consideration of this ex
emption it Is provided that the university will
admit student "residents of California" free
from tuition fees. This advantaue will doubt
less attract to that splendid Institution many
.students who might otherwise avail themselves
of the free tuition of the State University, which
may In time tend to prevent the overcrowding
of the University of California. Legislation will
be necessary In connect'on with this as well
as other of the constitutional amendments, to
properly carry Into effect the Intention of th>Â»
people in exempting this university from tax
ation.
By the passage at the last election of Assem
bly constitutional amendment No. 23, the
trusts and estates for the endowment and
maintenance of the Leland Stanford Junior
University tire exempted from taxation, and It
therefore Imposes upon thin institution a quasi-
I believe lin substantial appropriations to as
sist every wise and practical method of educa
tion which may be adooted. by the university
In Its court*. I believe therefore that the unl'
verslty should be liberally maintained, but not
lavishly, so as to become an unnecessary bur
den upon the taxpayers of the State.
In thus submitting my views upon the ne
cessity of amending the laws relative to the
maintenance of the university, it must not be
supposed that I could desire to have Its growth
Impaired by any parsimonious legislative rem
edies. On t ne contrary. I believe firmly in high
er education. While my love for the common
school Is Intense, I would also like to see the
State University a greater Institution of learn
ing than any other in the world. But I do
not believe in waste aiid In Idle show. I
would like to see the highest scientific and
classical ideals attained, but I would also wish
to see those ideals anchored In this practical,
matter-of-fact world. Education should not be
mere ornamentation. The student of the unl
.verslty, whether graduating as bachelor of
arts, bachelor of science, bachelor of philoso
phy or otherwise, should be already In touch
with the busy world about him, and able t~>
cope from a practical standpoint with the dif
ficulties which ordinarily beset the graduates
of our schools and colleceK.
In this connection I also recommend that tui
tion fees be required of all non-resident stu
dents attending the State Xormal Schools.
I therefore recommena that section 1394 of
the Political Code should be so amended, or
that a law be passed requiring non-resident
students of the university to pay reasonable
tuition fees.
If It be a fact that our university Is becoming
overcrowded, certainly measures should ba
adopted giving preference to the children of our
taxpayers rather than Rrivlng place to children
of residents of other States and foreign coun
tries.
Some time ago It was proposed before tho
board of regents that all university students
should be subjected to a. tax for the support
of the university. I took occasion then to vig
orously oppose such an unjust plan, among
ether grounds because the university, being
supported by the people of California as a
part of its plan of public education, and open
to rich and poor alike, t-uch a. tax would b9
in violation of the rights of the people who
supported this Institution. The student tax was
defeated. The Injustice of the proposed student
tax lay in the fact that It was sought to im
pose a tax ui>on the children of the taxpayers
of the State whese money was already main
taining the university. Since the foundation
of the university the people of California have
maintained and supported that Institution by
the payment of taxes. It is manifestly unjunt
that the people of this State should be taxed
to educate the children of non-residents and
non-taxpayers of other States and of foreign
countries.

SENATE ADDS FORTY-ONE
NAMES TO ATTACHE LIST
during the first ten fiscal years from the ap
proval of the etatute is to be devoted to the
purposes of acquiring lands, buildings and
other permanent Improvements.
About the time of the passage of the last
statute of 1S37. during the administration of
niy able predecessor, 1 have been informed that
public assurance was given by the represen
tatives of the university that, as a result of
this law, ample funds would be provided for
the permanent support of the university and
further calls upon the Legislature for appro
priations for support would be unnecessary and
would not be demanded. The people have since
the passage of this last act of 1S!<7 graciously
submitted to the 2 per cent tax for the sup
port of the university, but It must be ad
mitted that the malnier.anee of the university
through etandlng taxes, in the light of this
experience, is, to say the least, very disap
pointing.
Prior to the passage of the act of February
14. 1SS7, providing for a continual tax for the
nupport of the university It had been the rule
for each Legislature to provide sufficient ap
propriations for its maintenance for two years
in advance, in the same manner adopted for
the support of other public Institutions. The
condition of the university was therefore
exhibited directly to the representatives of
the people, and became . thereby a Â«ubject
of public discussion and concern. By this
method the people were brought into touch
with thÂ« management of the Institution and
could easily learn thrjugh their representatives
Its actual condition. While the regents are
obliged under the law to report the condition
of the university annually, such report* are
not read by the people, and Renerally their rep
resentatives by reason of their many and varied
duties have neither time nor opportunity to
give such reports careful attention. In con
sequence the real condition of the university
Is withheld from the people.
The people, through their representatives In
the Legislature, have never been parsimonious
In appropriations for the support of the uni
versity, but have on the contrary generously
assisted it when Its ecnditlon was shown to
require assistance. I venture the opinion,
therefore. In the light of the past history
of the university, that standing taxes for its
support are not as productive of benefit to that
splendid crown of thÂ» common schools as ap
propriations passed by each Legislature accord
ing to Its Increased or diminished necessities.
The people have the highest concern in know
ing the condition of the university, as well as
that of ether public institutions.
No- State Institution should be above the law,
nor removed from public scrutiny.
From a report recently' received by me from
the pecretaj-y of the Board of Regents the sum
received by the university from the 2 per cent
tax for the fl?ral year ending June 30, WOO,

Inasmuch as one-half of Uie revenues derivtcl
from the additional tax provided by the act
of February 27, 18P7, must, under the law, b<s
used for permanent Improvements, such as the
acquisition of lands and buildings. It Is my
onlr.lon that it Is unnecessary that the tax for
â¢ W Hh cur increase la wharfage facilities we
believe we may safely calculate on a. still
p: eater increase la our receipts. For the om
lr.g five years the receipts of this commission.
In cur judgment, will average fTSM-OO per an
num, and on this basis the following will
clearly demonstrate the possibilities 'or harbor
improvements under the enabling legislation of
the extra session:
Estimated receipts for the coraing five
years at JTiO.oOO per year $3,750,000
Estimate of current expenses, including
r.ecessary repairs during the coming

The following Is a list of the adjutant gen
eral given t<> me of atoies and supplies issued
to the Guard:
The tdjutant general's department has been
managed with commendable economy and at
the fame time sufflcle?it supplies and equip
ments have been purchased by the State and
furnished by the United States Government so
that the Guard is novr better equipped than,
ever before In the history of the State.
The patriotism of our California Volunteers,
as well as their loyalty to this State, Induced
them eagerly to avail themselves of the benefits
of the statutes and their active service In camp
ar.d field glv^s as well new vigor to the Guard
as it inspires emulation.
One of the efficient aids to the present lm
rroved condition of the Guard waa the passagtt
by the Legislature at Its thirty-third session
of the act entitled "An aet regarding organi
zatif.nw, officers and members of the National
Guard who entered the United States volun
teer service In the Spanish-American war of
189S." etc., approved March 21. 1833" (Stats.
Cal.. 1S99. p. 108. et seq.), which enabled the
returned officers and men of the National
Guard, California Volunteers, who had been
jrustered Into the United States service, to re
enter the National Guard and report for duty.
The present condition of the National Guard,
us compared with its condition at the begin
ning of this administration, reflects credit upon
the adjutant general and the officers of the
National Guard. The Spanish-American war of
1S98 as well destroyed the efficiency of tha
Guard as it depleted It In point of numbers.
About 1200 officers and men scattered through
out the State represented its entire numerical
strength. At the present time the Guard num
bers over 4000 officers and men. Inclusive cf
the naval militia, consisting: of 425 officers and
men.
SPI-ENDID CONDITION
OF NATIONAL GUARD
How Is it possible for him to report the con
dition of the State in all instances unless he
shall be entitled to call upon the various of
ficials throughout the State fcr such informa
tion as may be desired pertaining to their par
ticular departments? And how is this possible
unless It be made the duty of Â«uch officials.
State, county and city, to furnish to the Gov
ernor, on reasonable demand, such reeded In
formation, and unless there be Home mode pr->
vlded by law to punish a dishonorable official
for neglecting or reiuElng compliance there
with?
The State constitution provides that the Gov
erncr "Shall see that the laws are faithfully
executed." â¢ â¢ â¢ and that "he shall com
municate by message to the Legislature at
every -session the condition of the State, and
recommend such matters aa he shall deem ex
pedient."
Again, ' matters sometimes arise within the
State which are the grounds of international
questions, and the executive is requested by
the United States Secretary cf State to for
ward a report * of the facts of an Alleged
breech of treaty^through the act of some term
holding State-, county or municipal officer.
While the mere privilege of requesting sucu re
port of such ofllcer Is afforded the executive.
it 13 equally a privilege on the part of such
officer to either notice or wholly ignore thÂ»
request of the executive. In consequence it
has happened in pome instances that little or
no information could be afforded the Depart
ment of State at Washington, and that little
Information war only given this office through
the barest official courtesy. I have been com
pelled many times to call the attention of tko
Federal authorities to the inability of the
executive. un3er the laws of this Stats, to
compel the transmission of proper or much
needed Information from our State, county an I
municipal officers. I submit that this defect
In the law should be appropriately remedied,
especially as you will remember that, outside
cf the appointees In the Governor's office,
tfcere are very few State officers whom tha
Governor has the power to remove for mis
conduct. An officer once appointed for a term
of years has the power to defy both the people
and the executive and to conduct his office
according to his own pleasure, provided he doe*
not reveal tangible evidences of crime.
"But, as I said in my message to the Legis
lature, if the Governor is to be held respon
sible for the conduct of the departments whoaa
Incumbents he names, he should be given con
trol of those functionaries, etc. Such control
has not been given. I appealed to the last
two Legislatures to pass some law empower
ing the Governor to control the- Institutions.
and pointed out how much I had been embar
lassed by the lack of such laws. ISoth Legis
latures refused to pass the requisite bills, and
I found myself helpless when occasion arose
for severe and determined treatment. If abuses
exist they are the direct result of such failure
to pass the bills recommended. I again recom
mend that 'for cause and upon a hearing' tha
Governor be glvÂ«"n the power to remove 1i:j
own appointees."
In this aspect of the case I quote the fol
lowing language of Governor Budd In his sec
ond biennial message on the .very eve of his
retirement from office, and submit the same for
your careful consideration:

ECONOMIC REPOBM
AND LOW TAXATION
My efforts to fulfill my pre-election pledges
of giving the people an economic government
were sustained by the excellent body of "Sena
tors and Assemblymen who sat In the thirty
third legislative session. I am satisfied how
ever, that the members of th* present Legisla
ture, if you will only resolve so to do can
surpass the good work of the preceding Legis
lature by urging on still further economic re
form. The times are} auspicious. The people
of our State have been Just disburdened from
years of depression. The recent eleellon has
demonstrated how near President llcKlnley Is
to tha hearts of the people and how fully his
foreign and domestic policy reflects their
wishes. The Philippines, a key to Oriental
commerce, being now American territory." will
enrich and build up the varied industries of
this State. Â¦Â«
It is right, therefore, that no reactionary
depression should be developed by the imposi
tion of a heavy tax rate through excessive ap
propriations or otherwise. Let the buoyant
feeling which inspirits alike the laborer and
merchant, the farmer and banker, continue
unchecked, no that business activity may not
bÂ«Â» marred by the shadow of a too greedy tax
gatherer.
It lies with you, as legislators, to So appor
tion ' the State's money that all proper debts
may be paid and the wants of an" public In
stitutions be sufficiently but not extravagantly
supplied. .
It Is Impossible In a message to call atten
tion to all the . necessities of the State. Â»nd
as you are each acquainted with a particular
district and with Its actual need* I will be
pleased at all times during the session to con
fer with you as to all Mich needs, so that the
legislative and executive departments may In
telligently co-operate In an economic govern
ment. â¢ by giving the people the lowest rate
of taxation In the history of the PtAte.
In view of the number of approrriatlens

ernment, the maintenance of the several public

may the proposition to abolish the can
teen.
In the course of Hawley's statement he
was Interrupted frequently by Pettigrew,
who wanted to leaxu tho reasons for ex
cluding wine from the post exchanges.
Finally Hawley became Impatient and de
clared he would not answer another Ques
tion.
"I am quite well aware," retortad Pot
tigrew, "of the Senator's inability to an
swer my question."
Angry in an instant, the Connecticut
Senator demanded with some heat:
"Â¦\Vhat does the Senator mean by that
'low down' insult. Has ho been to a
saloon outside of the post exchange?"
The laughter which arose served to
clear the atmosphere and the Incident
passed.
Money of Mississippi said hÂ» was thor
oughly convinced that the post exchange
promoted temperance, health, morals and
discipline among the soldiers of the army.
In response to arguments advanced by
Sewell and Money in favor of tho post
exchange, Gallinger directed attention to
the system 4n the navy. Under the law
the sailors were given 5 cents per day In
addition to their pay in lieu of grog ra
tion?. This had been found to be an ex
cellent system and he- believed it wtjuld be
Â¦well to apply it to the army. He de
clared that during the first four years
after the canteen was established court
martial had increased in tho army 16 per
cent.
Hansbrough of North Dakota, who has
been recognized as one of the leading op
ponents In Congress of the post exchange,
made an extended argument in opposi
tion to the committee amendment. He de
clared that the use of beer detracted from
the men's usefulness as soldiers and from
their morality as men. The sale of beer
in the canteen has been shown (quoting:
from a letter from an army officer) to be
at fhe bottom of most of the trouble and
misery of the soldier. He had hoped that
Congress would signalize the opening of
the twentieth century by wiping from the
statute books the authorization of the
Government saloon.
Thurston of Nebraska, Fiatt of Connec
ticut and. Jones of Â» Arkansas were ap
pointed as conferees on the part of the
Senate on two bills ratifying treaties
v;lih the Cherokee and the Muskogee or
Crpflk Indians.
The Senate at 5:10 p. rn. adjourned.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 8.â During
the legislative session of to
day the Senate had under
consideration the much-moot
ed canteen question In con
nection with the army reorganization bill.
The Senate committee in effect restored
the provision for a post exchange, or can
teen, which had been stricken out of the
bill by the House. For nearly five hours
the " Senate discussed the committee
amendment, but a vote on the proposition
Is not yet In sight. Galllnger of New
Hampshire and Hansbrough of North Da
kota vigorously opposed the amendment,
and In turn It was quite as strenuously
supported by Sewell of New Jersey, Haw
ley of Connecticut, Money of Mississippi
and Carter of Montana.
Discussion of the canteen question was
opened by Galllnger of New Hampshire,
in opposition, to tna pyposed amendment
of the committee permitting the sale of
beer. Galling-er made an extended argu
ment In support of his position, quoting
many eminent authorities to prove that
the use of alcoholic stimulants among
men in and out of the army was most
deleterious in its effects. He urged that
the bill be left, sd far as the canteen
question is concerned, as It was when it
came from the House.
Sewell. a member of the Military Affairs
Committee and long a member of the
board of managers of the Soldiers' Homes
of the country, said the canteen had been
adopted at the Soldiers' Homes simply as
a temperance measure. The canteens
were all allowed to sell to the old soldiers
only beer, and it had been found that the
inmates were willing to take a glass or
two of beer at the canteen in preference
to visiting the t;roBBeries which surround
ed nearly all of these institutions.
In conclusion Sewell said: "The Amer
ican soldier ought not be condemned to
a reformatory. We cannot recruit the
army if you abolish the post exchange.
It Is opposed to the soldier's Idea of lib
erty to be tied down In that way and he
will not have it."
Hawley declared that the post exchange
promoted disclpllna and good order in tho
army. He paid that the officers as well
as the men of the iirmy viewed with dis-
yft whose cases are so worthy as to Impress
the Governor that their beha.vlor would Indicate
a complete reform. Tet as the conduct of such
prisoners would not without a test justify the
executive In granting a full or even a condi
tional pardon, it would appear Just that such
prisoners should be tried by a limited parole
â¢with full power on the part of the executive at
any time of terminating the parole granted by
the State Board of Prison Dlrecors.
I suggest that the powers of the State Board
of Prison Directors under the said act be ex
tended to the granting of such limited paroles
to all worthy reformed prisoners: provided,
however, that no such limited parole be granted
until such prisoner shall have served at lea-st
two calendar years In one of the State prisons.
WAR CLAIMS AGAINST
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
I beg leave here to call your attention to
what was said by me In my inaugural address
on January 4, 1S93. respecting the unsettled
claims of our State against the national Gov
ernment, arising out of the civil war. -In order
that you may. if you deem such course advis
able, pass .appropriate resolutions instructing
our Senators and requesting our Representa
tives to urge the passage of a law refunding
to the State the money advanced for equipping
and paying the California volunteers.
In my Inaugural address I expressed my con
victions as follows:
â¢â¢The claims of California against the gen
eral Government for furnishing, equipping and
Daying volunteers during the civil, war. aggre
gating over $4,000,000. are still unsettle* \.a
rious bills have been from time to time intro
duced in both the United States Senate and
House of Representatives, but they have been
either abandoned after introduction orreferred
to committees without final action taken there
on On June 9.-1S3S, the United States Senate
adoped a resolution in the matter of H. R.
4C3<5 respecting these claims, and appointed
three Senators, viz.. Teller. Pascpe and Btew*
art to confer with the House of Representa
tives. A provision for the payment to this
State of $3,951,915 42. in full settlement of Cali
fornia's claims, has been included in the Sen
ate amendment. California cheerfully furnished
to the Federal Government soldiers in defense
of the Union., and while the nation had the
right to this support, it had no L^K 1 * "> *{>Â«
money, amounting UÂ» over $4,000,000, which- the
State advanced for the equipment of its vol
unteers: and this money should now be re
stored to the State Â¦ with . interest. Our Sen
ators and Represenatlves in Congress should
be requested to nse every lawful effort for the
massage of a bill allowing these war claims for
at least $3,951,915 42. the amount allowed, in the
Congressional bill to which reference has Just
been made. These war claims are both Just
and equitable, and the State has long and pa
tiently waited trr this settlement"
Under the acC of the Legislature approved
March 10 1S99, I appointed the three follow
ing distinguished citizens of our State as Com
missioners to the great Paris Exposition: The
Hons Ben C. Truman of Los Angeles. W. W.
Foote of San Francisco. E. W. Runyon of Red
Bluff, all of whom duly qualified according to
law and entered upon Â¦ the discharge of their
duties. Commissioners Foote and Runyon have
recently s returned from Paris, but the other
commissioner ia still In Europe.
The Commission has * not Â¦ an - yet filed with
me > the report '. of its proceedings, - and â¢ In thH
absence of which I cannot , make further offi
dal statement.
Under the provisions of section ft of an act
entitled "An act to authorize suits against
the State, and regulating the procedure-there
in." approved February. 28. 1S93 (Stats. 1893.

The cost of maintenance for one year is based
on the per capita cost of each hospital for the

beÂ«n maintained, say twelve years or aver

cost of $140 per year, or 125.686 for the SO per

ducting from this the cost of deportation

State- . .
It win be the endeavor of this administration
to induce the various foreign Consuls to take
care of their insane citizens confined in our
insane asylums by deportation to their ro
Â£T>ectI\^ countries.
The means sometimes adopted of spiriting
into our State hospitals the Insane of other
states end of foreign countries should not be
tolerated.
The State hospitals are in part maintained
by the taxation of our own people In charity
to those in our midst who are or may become
demented. It is not right therefore that resi
dents of other States should, as has been
sometimes done, recretly carry their insane in
;to. this State, to be supported at the expenaa
of the taxpayers of this Stats.
I suggest that come measures be passed em
powering the State Lunacy Commission to ef
.fectually quarantine against the insane of
other States and other countries.
PABDONS, REPRIEVES
AND COJOTUTATIONS
The most painful duty which comes within
the province of the executive is to decide upon
petitions for pardon, reprieve and commutation.
There are now pending before me about 200
different applications for pardon. Perhaps
Â«.Â¦> per cent have some circumstances
appealing for clemency. The tendency of the
human mind is not to resist but to yield to the
appeals of unfortunate criminals and their
heart-broken relatives.
There is a higher duty which the executive
owes to the people. He must not allow his per
sonal sympathies to be swayed. The law abid
ing people of the State require protection.
Crimes, whether due to weakness of nature or
to cool deliberation, must be punished. To lib
erate criminals upon the appeal of relatives in
all Instances where the convicts have repented
and have served very long and severe sentences
would be practically to declare that crimes
should not be punished. Influence savoring of
a political character, which Is sometimes at
tempted, is most objectionable and should never
be the key to executive clemency. Appeals to
me of this nature will result, as In the past
in speedy denials.
In nearly 60 per cent of the cases which have
been presented the applications are accompanied
by a petition signed by the Jury which convict
ed the criminal and by a letter of the trial
Judge, expressing his opinion that the sentence
Imposed was perhaps too severe, or that the
ends of Justice would be subserved by the lib-
â¢ This means of attempting to 6hlft the re
sponsibility of a severe sentence upon the exec
utive Is not an argument which can have much
effect upon me, where the trial has been pre
sumably a fair one and where the evidence
tends to prove the guilt of the accused.
Judges are sworn to do thelr'duty. The trial
Judge has the case before him with the living
witnesses, whose demeanor and words bear the
Impress of truth or falsehood. -The Judge has
heard the case, and while the Jury may con
vict, the power of granUng a new trial still
rests with him.
Under these circumstances, acting upon the
presumption that the sworn officers of the law
.have don* their duty. I have steadfastly dis
regarded such appeals In clear cases.
1 I have patiently examined each case In the
light of my duty to the people, and while my
heart has many times urged me to sign the
paper which would bring Joy to the- prisoner
and to his anxious friends, yet my oath of
office and my responsibility to the people to
maintain the law had demanded a different
cÂ«irse. .
The number of pardons, reprieves and com
mutations during the last two years of. my ad
ministration Is, I regret, necessarily smallâ only
one pardon being granted. . The following Is the
list: .
First â William Kagel, a butcher by trade,
over 70 years of age, in the month of January,
1899, in the Superior Court of Modoc County,
pleaded guilty to the crime, of furnishing liq
uor to an Indian and was sentenced to eight
months' Imprisonment I in the County Jail of
Modoc County. A petition for his pardon,
signed, by many leading business and profes
sional men of Modoc County, and by many of
the county officials, was duly presented to me.
.The District Attorney Joined in the petition for
clemency and the Judge who tried the cause
waived. in writing all objections to executive
clemency. â¢ A .full pardon was granted by me
to William Nagel on the"2d day of June, 1899.
for the following reasons: * It satisfactorily ap

was furnished sustained no tribal relations:
that the time of furnishing the liquor by Nagel
was on one of the Christmas holidays; that
Kagel was so intoxicated at the time as not
to know the , nature of the act he was com

profit, but *s an act of drunken generosity. It

STATE HOSPITALS FOR
INSANE WELL MANAGED
So far as it has been possible for the State
Lunacy Commission to control and regulate the
internal I management of the State Hospitals
for the Insane, its efforts have been very el
fective. but it must be remembered that the
managers of the several hospitals hold for
terras, and that the Governor has no power of
removal or change or such managers. This
is true of all subordinate State officers hold
ing lor fixed terms. At the extra session of
1900, upon my recommendation, the act to es
tablish a State Lunacy Commission, approved
March SI. 1Â£S7, was s=o_ amended as to allow the
commission to fix the salaries of all officers
and employes of the several State Hospitals
for the Insise. This most . salutary measure
enabled the commission subsequently tu ar
range uniform salaries for such officials, and
to make reductions amounting to nearly J20.000
annually. It was found, however, necessary,
on account of the Increased number of patients
and because of the previous limited service,
which had sometimes permitted escape tram
the asvluxns. to apply much of this saving In
the employment of additional subordinate at
tendants, as well as to secure the services of
female physician? . The number of patients" In
the asylums of this State is C311. of which 1960
While some abuses remain which require at
tention at the bands of the boards of man
agers (which it is to be hoped will soon be
removed), yet on the whole the State Hos
pital* for the Insane, bo far as it has been
possible for the present administration to deal
with the questions, are much better managed
than ever before.
] At the Inception of my administration I per
ceived the necessity of employing female physi
cians in the State Hospitals for the Insane on
account- of -the larre number of female pa
tient*. I laid thÂ« matter before the Lunacy
Commission, and I am pleased to say that the
plan met with the hearty approval of ' the
rrfembers of the commission, and two -female
physicians were appointed s-tter due examina
tion as to their <juali3cationsâ -one. being as
eigned to Xapa and the other to Stockton, and
duty requires them to visit the other State
asylums.

Grievous wrongs have been sometimes report.
I pa of the misuse of private asylums for insane
and feeble-minded persona. Such private asy
lums are. when rightly conducted, of great
benefit to the relatives of unfortunates, who
are enabled to hat"e proper care taken of In
competents-without subjecting the patients to
the publicity which accompanies their custody
in the State Hospitals. But as forcible deten

cases. It sometimes happens that such asy

There may arise cases where certain sane an-1

TO CHECK ASSAULTS
. IN STATE PRISONS
WASHINGTON. Jan." 8.â Thte Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day, in an opin
ion by Commissioner Prouty, announced
Its decision In the case of George J. Kln
dall and the Denver Chamber of Com
merce ajraln?t ; the Atchlson, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad Company and others.
The case involves the Jegality of greater
freight charges to Denver than to Sai,
Franesieo from the Missouri River and
points East; greater freight charges from
Denver than from the Missouri River and
points East to San Francisco; greater
freight charges to Denver than to the
Missouri River and points East from San
Krancisco; greater freig-ht charges from
Denver than from San Francisco to the
Missouri River and points East.
Water competition, the opinion says,
fixes the rate between New York and San
Francisco, and the carriers, in pursuance
of their own Interests, have recognized
the desire of Chicago and Missouri River
points to do business on the Pacific Coast,
and for that reason have given Â¦ to Chi
cago and points on the Missouri River a
rate in no case higher arid in-many cases
lower than obtains at New York. The
commission says if these railroads have
carried the rate which water competition
fixes. 1400 miles from the Atlantic sea
board, they must not ship there. Neither
the desire to do business nor the right to
do business ceases with the Missouri Riv
er. Denver, 1000 miles west of Chicago,
may demand the same treatment which
its rival cities have received.
It is held by the commission that the
rates complained of are in violation of the
fourth and third sections of the act to
regrulate commerce, and that as a matter
of general application rates at Denver to
or from the East or to and from the Pa
cific Coast ought not to be higher than
those between Pan Francisco or other Pa
cific Coast terminals and the Missouri
River or points Kast. In the case of east
bound traffic the carriers' contention that
the rate of sugar might be higher to Den
ver than to the Missouri River Is sus
tained. It being found that the commis
sions governing the traffic are different
when It is carried to Missouri River
points than when it stops at Denver. The
commission decides also that Denver Is
not entitled, by reason of its being nearer
San Francisco, to a lower rate than that
In force from the Missouri River.

Secondâ Ysabel Molina, a Mexican subject,
was convicted in Kern County of the crime of
murder !n the first decree for the killing of
Amellano â¢ Ramos, a Mexican or Indian, at
Bakersfield, In December, 1897, and was on De
cember 11, 1S99, sentenced by the Judge of the
Superior Court to be executed at the prison ot
San Quentln on January 12, 19C0. On the 31st
day of December, 1899, I received a telegraphic
appeal from the Mexican Embaspador at Wash
ington requesting an examination into the case,
and the extension of clemency to the con
demned.
Upon an examination of the records In tho
Executive Department, I discovered that cer
tain papers had not been transmitted to me
from the Superior Court of Kern County, as
required by law. and also that It would be
necessary. In view of the prisoner's record,
that the Supreme Court should pass upon the
question of the exercise of clemency. Therefore,
on January 6. 1900, I reprieved the sentence of
the prisoner until April 6, 1900, In order to se
cure the needed records and to enable a ma
jority of the Justices of tho Supreme Court of
the State to pass upon the recommendation for
clemency. Subsequently, and, before the expira
tion of the reprieve, I submitted all the rec
ords transmitted to me bearing upon the case
to the Justices of the Supreme Court. On the
3<1 day of April, 1900. I received from a- majority
of the Justices of the Supreme Court a recom
mendation that the sentence of the prisoner be
commuted to Imprisonment for life, as prayed
for. None of the other Justices of the Supreme
Court Indicated an opinion to the contrary.
1'pon a review of the testimony In the case I
determined that the killing occurred as the
consequence of a brawl with the deceased, and
that the recommendation of the learned Judges
Â¦was In conformity with Justice. Therefore,
agreeably to the recommendation of the Su
preme Justices, on the fifth day of April, A. I>.
1900, I commuted the sentence of Ysabel Mo
lina to imprisonment. for life.
Thirdâ Harry 'Winters, convicted of murdÂ«*r
In the first degree In San Mateo Countj-. was
f< nfTicfi to be executed on October 27. 1J99,
at the State Prison at . Folsom. Prior to the
date of the sentence, to wit. on October 9, IS??,
Warden Aull of the prison died, and the Attor
ney General having given his opinion that thÂ»
sentence could not be carried into effect on
October 27, 1S99, by reason of the failure of
the Prison Directors to elect a new Warden. I
therefore, on October 26, 1S33. reprieved the
sentence of said Harry Winters until December
8, 1S99, on which day said prisoner was exe
cuted according to law â a new Warden having
been previously elected.
Fourthâ George Puttman was convicted of the
crime of murder In the- first degree for Killing:
a fellow convict In the State Prison at FolÂ«om,
on September 18. 1900, and was. afterward, by
an order of the Judge of the Superior Coutt of
Sacramento County, sentenced to.be executed
a*, eald prison, on October 6, 1900. Upon peti
tion by his counsel that he desired to perfect
his appeal to the Supreme Court from the iudc
ment-of death, and he belnjr by section 12.13
of the Penal Code entitled to sixty days In
which to perfect- paid appeal, and-sald date of
sentence being l9?s than the time allowed de
fendant by law to perfect his' said appeal, on
the third day of October, 190O, I reprieved the
sentence of said prisoner until November- 13,
1000, on which day said prisoner was executed
according to law.
iThe discipline of the State Prison must be
preserved. Prisons are not only Intended for
the reform of the prlsoner-and as an example
to the lawless element of the community but
likewise for punishment of crimes. The great
est vigilance of the prison officers cannot pre
vent occasional outbursts of violence where
criminals are kept together in such numbers as
In this State. It has been a matter of observa
tion that in many cases, where desperate con
victs have been setenced to life imprison
ment.-a spirit of abandon has overcome them.
Knowing that they are immune from any
higher- punishment, where crimes less than
murder are committed by them within the
prison walls, they have sometimes feloniously
assaulted the turnkeys, guards and even their
follow^ prisoners. The case of Jacob Oppen
heimer at Sun Quentln is more notorious and
suggestive of the need of legislation than that
of Puttman at the . Folsom Prison. Oppen
helmer, a vicious life prisoner and a ringleader
of a few desperate convicts, had inade felonious
assaults upon guards and fellow prisoners,, and
on one occasion he attempted to strangle one
of the guards. On another occasion he delib
erately stabbed one of the* guards a number of
times. Inflicting severe, wounds. He seemed
r.ot to dread -the ordinary punishment of the
prison. This and other examples of the crim
inal . deeds of Â¦ life convicts bid me urge . the
passage of a law which shall make It a. crime
punishable with death for any life convict to
feloniously make an assault . with Intent. to do
great bodily harm upon any person.' .
I am satisfied that the enactment of such a
law would tend to sustain the, discipline of our
State prisons by holding out' the dread alter
native of death to such of the abandoned life
prisoners as devote their spare moments to the
hatching of infamous plots. - - '
The number of prisoners confined, in the State
prisons is 2045. of which number 1293 are con
fined . in San Quentln Â¦ and 762 in Folsom. . Of
these 2045 State prisoners only . nineteen are
women â these latter being confined In the State
prison at San Quentln. .This exceedingly small
number of female convicts, unparalleled In any
State in the Union, is a splendid testimonial to
the characters of . the women of California.'.- 1 â Â¦'Â¦
There are frequently appeals made on v be
half of State prisoners who are ' not Â¦ permitted
to be paroled under the provisions of an act
of March 23, 1S93, entitled "An act to establish

YOKOHAMA, Dec. 22.â In foreign com

a second decision in the customs over an
importation of liquors, .which, though
marked by the United States authorities
as exactly in accordance with samples
previously submitted and upon which
the duty, had been declared, \ is now
charged a rate of two and a half times
as much as that at first fixed.
The commercial crisis has assumed an
acute aspect, trade being at a complete
standstill. It is freely predicted that a
great number of the weaker houses will
go to the wall. The, recent excess of im
portations has filled the warehouses with
unsalable goods, which, though duly orÂ»
dered by tne Japanese merchants, cannot
be taken delivery of In the present tight,
condition of the money market. As a con
sequence the foreign merchants are af

which can be looked for until the Chi

were heard to-day In the Paris clubs and

: It will be remembered that during the
early part of last spring Comte de Luber

child, against whom he was said to have
a long standing : grievance, due to an in
cident that happened when both were
youths. As, however. Baron Robert de
Rothschild ,was a minor, Comte de
Lubersac's second refused to accept the
responsibility of the meeting. The duel
consequently did not take place. In spite
of Baron Robert de Rothschild's protesta

that a meeting will be arranged and. a

Monday the search for the bodies of Mrs.
J. M. Bennett and two children was re
sumed along Sullivan Creek. Many
volunteers from Sonora took part. The
remains of the mother was found first,
one mile below the point where they en
tered the stream, embedded in the sand
with dnftwood about it % Two miles below
the body of the boy was discovered,
wedged between rocks. The remains of
the 11-year-old daughter have * not been
found. The funeral of the mother and
son took place from the Presbyterian
church at Sonora this afternoon. There
was a large attendance of ladies.
J. M. Bennett, the father, is a poor man.
The citizens of Sonora raised J125 to de
fray the expenses of the funeral. Ben
nett Is nearly crazed with grief. The
family, notwithstanding the fierceness of
Sunday's storm, was moving from a
ranch four miles above Sonora into this
city. Mr. Bennett was driving a team,
hauling their household effects. The
mother and children drove on ahead. He
warned Mrs. Bennett not to ford the
creek, but to cross the bridge half a mile
below. When he drew near the bridge
his attention was attracted by the family
dog barking on the bank of the stream.
The dog had gone with Mrs. Bennett, but
there was no trace of her or of the light
wagon. Bennett's fears were ' aroused.
He mounted one of his horses and hurried
to Sonora. On reaching there he 'learned
that his wife had not been there and
realized that she and the children had
been drowned.

OAKLAND, Jan. 8.â The California
Yacht Club at its annual meeting to
night withdrew from the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Racing Association. This is
the first step in an effort to cause the
dissolution of the association which for
five years has controlled the regattas for
the Macdonough and Commodore Law
cups. The plan involves a new organiza
tion of racing yacht owners to be formed
independently of the existing yacht clubs.
The chief reason for the present action
is the opposition of the club to the pay

which but a small representation from
thf club is made. &Â»MÂ»*efflSWS*Â»

met some moderate platers in the Becond
event, and 1 to 2 looked like finding a lit

the tlrpt part of the tour, thouch winning
eventually at leisure from Ting-a-L.lng
and Juva. Simon D with O'Connor up
commanded considerable support, but his
uhowing did not warrant the same.
Galanthus also was introduced In the
mile selling affair, for three-year-olds,
where he shone as a star. Seven to ten
was at first laid about Coffey's gelding,
and J. Daly landed him first six lengths
before Screenwall Lake. J. Ransch on
Litmus finished third, and bhould have
been second.
The track looked made to order for
Malay, causing the brown horse to be
sent to the post a 11 to 20 chance for the
mile and a quarter run. Added to this,
Winnie O'Connor had the leg up. Pedro

art In the 6ix-furlcngr sprint, fifth to be
decided. When Hermoso had tired after
\ainly endeavoring to pass Gibraltar,
Ordnung took the lead In the stretch.
Anjou now came fast from the rear, but
Ordnung held him safe, getting over the
mark a length in front. Hermoso, a 13 to
10 favorite, ran into the show.
Ike Morehouse, the Montana turfman,
made quite a clean-up in the last event
over the win of his black gelding Espi
rsmdo. Opening In the ring at 7, there was
no better than 4 at post time. Bassinger
had the mount, and getting away well
eoon took the lead and won all the way.
O'Connor got up with Alicia, downing the
favorite. Torsida. for place honors.
First choices in the ring did not pass
the hours as happily as they might have
done. Sam Fuller and Galanthus scored
at short odds, after which the story is to
be continued.
Old Ringmaster furnished the sensation
al feature of the sport by capturing the
first race at odds of 50 to 1, beating Birdie
Stone and Greenock in a hard drive. The
first named filly carried what Is termed
the "educated money," her price falling
from 6 to 4^ to L Nothing: much was ex
pected of Greenock. Fauntleroy, the col
ored lad, piloted the rank outsider, and
while the big chestnut gelding showed
much improvement it must be understood
he is a confirmed invalid, and a reversal
in this instance must be overlooked.
ONLY a rider with a microscopic
vision could perceive any differ

simply a sea of mud, and the
chances of several horses were ruined by
their riders taking them out wide at the

tion of the country is filling up with dog
owners and dosr fanciers who are com
ing to attend the annual Pacific Coast
field trials. They are to be held this
jear at Coronado Beach, North Island.
A force of men has been at work for a
â¢week clearing most of the underbrush
cU the island, where there is too much
growth for the best work. The trials will
be entirely on quail, and the island is J
alive with them, having been colonized
and protected there for many years.
Dog owners already here with their
Â¦Ftrir.ps of docs assert that the field J
trials of 1901 axe going on record as the ;
best ever held and future years will have
to chow something particularly fine to
equal the gathering of this year. There I
will be more dogs in both the derby and
fill-aee entries, and the entries show
higher class dogs. John Lucas is already
here with a string of twelve dogs which
are in training at Lakeside. H. fa. Peach
Is here with his own and W. W. Van j
Amsdale's strings. \V. B. Couts has a i
number of fine animals in the bunch he
is handling near Otay, and K. M. Dodge
has the Stockdale Kennel entries at Pala. :
These last are sixty miles from here now. j
but they wIU be brought in toward the
cod of the week and will be given the
last work at the Coronado race track, I
where there is plenty of room and enough j
birds to exercise the dogs. The dogs will
be Judged br Mr. Johnson of "Winnipeg. !
Manitoba, who has a mae reputation in j
Fuch matters. j
From the entries maoe and those which
ere to be here to enter in other stakes,
it is known that the best collection of
pointers and setters ever brought togeth
er on the coast will be here next week.
During the trials the dog men will make
their hcines at Hotel del Coronado. which
has offered a suitable rate to the mem- .
berÂ» of the association and their families. !
The entries for the all-age stake which j
have paid their second forfeit and will j
therefore be here are as follows: Stock- j
dale kennels' pointer dog, Cuba of Ken- I
wood: R. 8. Taylor's white pointer, Jim j
Pinch: Albert Betx's English setter. Mer

Railroad managers are as eager to get rid of com
petition as are persons in any other line of industry,
and, as the report says: "In no branch of industry
probably is the inducement to form combinations of
this sort greater or the advantages to be hoped for
from them when formed more certain than in railway
operation." Moreover, it is said the statutes th<m
felves operate to produce combinations, since they
forbid independent roads to form pooling contracts
fo^lcgitimate self-protection. â¢
Coming then directly to the subject of railway
combinations the synopsis continues: "The commis
sion has no official knowledge of the extent of recent
railway combinations, but it has informed itself as well
as possible from unofficial sources. Disregarding
mere rumors, but taking account of well authenticated
statements, there were absorbed in various ways be
tween July I, 1899, and November 1, 1000, 25,311 miles
of railroad. There are in the whole United States
something less than ioo.ooo miles of railroad, and
irore' than one-eighth of this entire mileage was.
within the above period, brought, in one way and
another, under the control of other lines. * * *
The commission goes on to say that when we con
sider what has* actually been done, what is undoubt
edly in contemplation, the entire feasibility of these
schemes, the very great advantage which would re-
often destructive."
AUCH of the annual report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission transmitted to Con
. gress on January 4 is devoted to a considera
tion of railroad combinations and the causes leading
to them. The synopsis given out to the press opens
with a summary of the statements of the commission
concerning that phase of interstate commerce. It is
the old story of the effort to evade the effects of com
petition and to escape the regulations of law.
The commission reports, in the first place, that the
anti-trust law is ineffective. The synopsis of the re
port says: "It is evident that railroad managers gen
erally have made no attempt to conform their prac
tices to the spirit of this law. They may keep within
its letter and succeed in avoiding its penalties, but
they claim that they are virtually compelled to coun
teract its aim and evade its observance. Thus it hap
pens that some of the most important and useful in
cidents of railway service are maintained by methods
which are believed to be inharmonious with if not in
actual violation of a Federal statute."
It' is pointed out that the competitive "system is re
sponsible for many of the evasions and violations of
the law, as the struggle for traffic leads the various
roads to resort to such practices to get business. The
report says: "The policy now pursued cannot and
will not prevent an outcome of vicious discrimina
tions, and, what is most unfortunate of all, those
discriminations favor the few and place the many at
a disadvantage; they aid the strong, who have no
need of assistance, and handicap the weak with bur
dens which by comparison are always unjust and
RAILROAD COMBINATIONS.
Here is wit and wisdom combined. The touch
upon each issue is light but effective. It is not likely
any intelligent Republican will hereafter, deny the
niyht of a former President of the United States to
fpctk upon the political question^ of the day, and if
he choose to dissent from the policy of his successor:
nor will any Bryanite regard Mr. Harrison as a prob
nbJe convert to Democracy. To both classes of critxs
he has given "Hail, Columbia," in more senses than
onr
. In conclusion he referred to the claims made by
tone Democrats that his opposition to "imperialism"
i* leading him to Bryanism, and said: "To me the
Democratic party has never been less attractive than
now. No plan of .reorganization suggests itself to
me, except that suggested by a waggish lieutenant of
my regiment to a captain whose platoons were in
verted. He said: "Captain, if I were in your place
I would break ranks and have the orderly call "the
roll.' Perhaps even this hopeful may
fai' for an inability to agree as to the roll and as to the
orderly."
Having thus stated his views upon the main ques
tion he next turned his attention to the critics who
have charged him with acting in a manner unworthy
of an ex-President. These critics, it will be remem
bered, have asserted that a former President should
not condemn the acts of an existing administration.
Mr. Harrison met the charge with delightful banter
by saying: "The decapitation of the ex-President
when the oath of office has been administered to his
successor would greatly vivify a somewhat tiresome
ctremonial. And we may some time* solve the news
paper problem what to do with our ex-Presidents in
that conclusive way. Until then I hope an ex-Presi
dent may be permitted to live somewhere midway be
tween the house of gossip and the crypt of* the
rrummy. He will know perhaps in an especial way
bow to show the highest honor to the Presidential
office and the most courteous deference to the Presi
dent Upon great questions, however, especially
upon questions of constitutional law, you must give
an ex-President his freedom or the ax, and it is too
Upon the issue involved in our relations to the isl
sr-ds he said: "I have no argument to make, here or
anywhere, against territorial expansion, but I do j
not, as some do. look to expansion as the safest or j
most attractive avenue of national development. By j
the advantages of abundant and cheap coal and iron,
of an enormous surplus of food products and of in
vention and economy in production, we are now lead
ing by a nose the original and the greatest of the
colonizing nations. Australia and New Zealand loy- i
ally send their contingents to South Africa, but Great
Britain cannot hold the trade of its colonies against
American offerings of a better or cheaper product.
The Central and South American states, assured of*
our purpose, not only to respect but to defend their
autonomy, and finding the peace and social order
which a closer and larger commercial intercourse with
the world will bring, offer to our commerce a field
the full development of which will realize the El Do
rado. Hail to Columbia, the home of the free, and
from which only freedom can go out."
HARRISON'S "HfNL COLUMBIA"
'IZ;X-PRESIDENT HARRISON in replying to
the toast, '"Hail, Columbia," at a recent banquet
â¢ â * of the Columbia Club in Indianapolis, took
occasion to justify his utterances concerning the rela
tion of the constitution to the Philippines and Porto
Rico, and in doing so gave to captious Republicans
and to exuberant Bryanites some advice in which
humor and wisdom were pleasantly mingled.
Here is a subject for a song and a parable for a
sermon all in one. We are not so far ahead of ou r
fathers as in our exultant vanity we have deemed our
selves. Those tallow candles in old Independence
Hall showing clear and steadily through the fog while
the blazing arc lights failed is a very good symbol of
many phases of contrast between the new age and the
old. A great deal of modern life 13 like the electric
light, very brilliant and showy so long as skies are
clear, but of little value when the fogs of disaster
come. The old tallow candles were not far flaming
even on the fairest of nights, but their light was con
centrated and was about' as good in a fog as at any
other time. Homely life like a candle is evidently not
a thing to be despised, and there are times, as Phila
delphia has learned, when the old light is better than
the new. , . :
It is always the unexpected that happens, even in
Philadelphia. The result of the happy thought was
not happy. The Public Ledger in commenting next
morning upon what had happened during the night
said of that feature of the show: "It was a good idea
in itself, but the fog came down and showed that thÂ«
century had accomplished nothing in the way of over
coming fog by artificial lights; or, at all events, that
under conditions of fog the incandescent electric lamp
is no better than the candle of our. forefathers. As a
matter of fact, the candles seemed to have rather the
best of it, the mass of light being more concentrated
in the flame of the candle than in the filament of ths
electric light. * The twentieth century ought to' do
something in the way of dispelling fogs."
Philadelphia in preparing for the celebration of the
new century concluded to make a display of this con
trast in lights. The great City Hall, of which Phila
delphians are so proud, was illuminated by electricity
regardless of expense. Every form of arc and of in
candescent lamp was placed upon the structure along
all salient lines of roof and of column in order to
make as glorious a splendor as humanity can achieve.
For the purpose of adding to the brilliant effect by
comparison the unobtrusive old building, Indepen
dence Hall, was lighted with tallow candles. It was a
happy thought. The people were to see the lights of
our time and the lights of the fathers in contrast, and
the triumph of the age was to be made manifest to the
eyes of all.
WHEN the old century was about to close it was
a familiar saying, "It had come in with tallow
candles and gone out with the arc light." The
phrase and the fact impressed the popular imagina
tion everywhere, and hardly a single glorification of
the nineteenth century was written or uttered that did
not make use of it.

Upon that showing of facts it is clear the commis
sion is justified in asking for greater powers. Unjust
freight discriminations between localities and indi
viduals are becoming serious matters, and it is time
something be done to guard the rights of the people
against extortions that may be practiced.
Many economic advantages will result from the
combinations, but a, danger lies in the fact that the
only check upon the rates is thereby removed. The
commission says: "Tt is idle to say that freight rates
cannot be advanced. During the past year they have
been, by concerted action upon a vast volume of
traffic, advanced in every part of this country. It m
equally idle to say that they will not be advanced.
It is both human nature and the lesson of history that
unlimited power induces misuse of that power. Rail
ways are not combining for the purpose of 'extortion
and abuse,' but none the less should the people pro
vide some protection against that possible result of
the combination."
suit to the owners of the properties involved, and the
fact that a step once taken in that direction is seldom
retraced, it becomes evident that in the immediate
future the main transportation lines of this country will
be thrown into great groups, controlling their own
territory, and not subject,' with respect to most of
their traffic, to serious competition."
All Americans, except sdme over-zealous mission
aries, will applaud and support this policy. It is
necessary to its success that the other allies under
stand that the President has the powerful and un
broken support of the American people. Therefore
by every avenue of expression it should be made
known that he is backed by practical unanimity. In
this way an inhuman war may be, averted, a commer
cial struggle may be avoided, and Christendom may
have a chance to repaii its somewhat damaged repu
tation.
It is now evident that our Government desires that
China shall be treated fairly, that the sore issue shall
be arbitrated, and the use of indemnity as an excuse
for partition shall be denied to the other allies.
President McKinley was compelled by the circum
stances to act in conjunction with the allies. His
policy has so far prevailed. He has compelled the
other nations to conceal, if not to abandon, their ter
ritorial designs. Germany has had to suspend her
po'icy of revenge, and in the joint note a fair basis
of agreement has, been presented to China and ac
cepted by her as the protocol of a treaty of adjust
ment.
The United States is in the affair by compulsion
and not by the choice of our Government or people.
Our legation was besieged, our Minister in peril, our
honor at stake. We moved promptly to the rescue
and wrought effectively in it. â-
Just such a case, of equal magnitude, and involving
such issues, has never before appeared in the world's
history.
With such appalling consequences impinged upon
the issue, wisdom dictates that China have her day in
court and that the final decision be in an arbitration
that can calmly weigh all the humane, military and
commercial considerations that are involved.
The keenest sighted statesmen in all the interested
nations- are averse to the partition of China. They
doubt the wisdom of such an enterprise and are
averse to testing the power of China to resist. That
such policy could be nccomplished only by a long and
exhausting war, which to succeed must practically
exterminate the able-bodied men in a population of
four hundred millions, is apparent to military and
civil authorities alike. The world's humanity turns
its face away from the spectacle of such carnage.
Commerce shrinks from it. While such a struggle
goes on the trade with China will be suspended, and
the devastations of war will so impair the fortunes
and resources of the people as to make its restoration
difficult and slow. Not only will the Chinese trade
be affected, but the commercial nations, deprived of
that demand, will more bitterly contest with each
other for the placing of their surplus, largely increased
by the elimination of the Chinese market. This con
dition will react upon the cotton-g'.owers of the
United States and the producers of foodstuffs every
where. In the military field there will arise the risk
cf conflicts of ambition between the partitioning na
tions themselves, and the struggle may possibly lead
tc a breach of the peace of the world.
In the case of China the allies were compelled to
send a joint military force to rescue their legations.
The cost of this armed force and exemplary indemnity
as a guarantee against future occurrence of the same
form of trouble are properly urged as public, gov
ernmental concerns. But there is a complication
novel to diplomacy. If the allies themselves, or a
majority of them, are to dictate the amount of this
indemnity, they may use the opportunity to compel
a partition of China. It is easily seen that if the
amount demanded is beyond her ability to pay in cash,
the allies must either abate it down to her capacity
or they must move upon her territory and divide it
among them in lieu of the money she is unable to
pay.
CHINESE INDEMNITY.
.. ! >; } :
THERE is a distinct line drawn between public
indemnity demanded for itself by one nation ot
another and private indemnity to recoup a citi
zen, which his Government enforces against a nation
which has despoiled bim as an individual.

HOME STUDY CTBCLE QUERIES.
A case In New Jersey may be men
tioned In which tha court again repeated
the rule that the servant does not agree
to take the chance of any negligence on
the part of his employer, and that no
court had gone so far as to hold that
where such negligence contributed to tha
injury the servant could not recover. This
was true In a case against a railroad
company that had a defective bridge . of
which its employes had no knowledge. A
fireman waa killed by its giving way when
the engine was crossing. The engineer
had had orders not to go over the bridge
with his engine, but the fireman did not
know of the order. His death, therefore,
was regarded as tba act of the company.
An employer cannot escape, therefore,
when he employs an Incompetent servant
or uses an unfit appliance from recom
pensing an employe on tha ground that ha
has been Injured through tba negllgenca
of another who is a co-employe. In other
words, to use the brief words of the Su
preme Court of Indiana: "A master Is lia
ble to his servant for Injuries resulting
from bis defective machinery, although.
the negligence of a fellow-servant con
tributed to the accident."
ALBERT EL BOLLES.
Havarford College.
Jersey.
In the case of Booth vs. the Boston and
Albany Railroad, a train started without
enough trainmen, and In consequence an
Injury happened to ona of tha employes
on the train. The court held the com
pany liable.
For his own negligence the master is
responsible to bis servants equally as to
any other person. Ths servant on enter
ing the employment of the master does
not assume the risks of the master's neg
ligence. Ha assumes the risk of the neg
ligence of a coservant, but the reason of
the rule which exempts tha master from
liability to one servant for the negligence
of another ceases and has no application
when the master's own negllgenca caused
the injury.
The rule that the master is not liable
for the negligence of a coservant docs
not, however, go to the extent of exon
erating him from liability in every case
where It appears that he did not himself
do or direct the doing of the negligent
act, or even when the immediate negll
genca Is that of a person who In soma.
sense was the coservant of the person
Injured. There are certain duties which,
concern the safety of the servant which
belong to the master to perform, and ha
cannot rid himself of responsibility to his
servant for not performing them by show-
Ing that he delegated the performance to
another servant, who neglected to follow
his Instruction or omitted to do the duty
intrusted to him. The duty of tha master
to select competent servants and to pro
vide safe Implements and machinery for
the use of his servants belongs, to this
class.
Application of the) Rule In New
The Hole Applied to a Railroad.
in a collision with another train of ths
same company. Its defense was that the
Injured engineer was a fellow servant of
the other engineer, and consequently
that the company was not liable. He* on
the other hand, contended that he was In
jured by the company through the negli
gence of one of Its servants, and that it
was llabla. The court held that ha was
right in his contention.
The case of Sherman vm, ilenomlnee
River Lumber Company Is an interesting
one. The saws were in a bad and dan
gerous condition. An employe who was
not engaged in sawing lumber was in
jured through the negligence of one who
was attending the machine. If the opera
tor himself had been injured the question
would have been very different, for then
the employer would have contended that
he knew of the defective condition of tha
machine and assumed tne risk of using
it. Had this been tha case, tha defensa
would hava been complete. But it was
not the case. Another employe sued the
employer, who knew nothing about tha
machine and was lgaorant of Its condi
tion. As ha was not engaged In operat
ing the saws there was no reason for
his knowing anything about them. The
principle, therefore, that applies to one
who Is using a defective machine and
knows of its condition does not apply to
another who is doing something els*.
though it may be he Is at work near by.
The employer, therefore, wus held liable,
for the Injury was regarded as caused
by the company Itself. Tha court said:
"We are of the opinion that tha negli
gence of the coemploye of the plaintiff,
under such circumstancea, would not ex
cuse tha defendant, but would simply ba
negligence contributing to tha injury
caused by the negligence of tha defend
ant, and both the coemploye and the de
fendant would be llabla to the plaintiff.
The culpability of the defendant lies In
the fact that It permitted tha use of a
machine In doing Its work which by rea
son of its defects was unnecessarily dan
gerous to its employes."
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
Another case has been decided in tha
same' State In which the principle was
again declared, but the . employe failed
chiefly because he was the most negli
gent. The cross beams Â¦ in a building
were Insecure and the employe assisted In
propping them up. After making them
as secure as he could they were still
dangerous, and no one had better knowl
edge of this than himself. Nevertheless.
he continued to work in the building,
moving barrels until It gave way and In
jured him. It was shown that had he
taken more pains In rolling barrels the ac
cident 'Would not have happened. Me
'was . therefore regarded Â¦ as the chief
author of his injury and could get nothing
from his employer.
An Employe Can Recover for the
Combined. Negligence of the Em
ployer and Another Employe.
When the negligence of the employer
and that of one of the employes produces
an Injury to another servant, the em
ployer Is liable therefor. ' The . Injured
servant assumes the risk of negligence of
his fellow-servant, but not the negligence
of his master. This rule was applied to
the J Grand Trunk Â¦ Railway by the Su
preme Court of tha United States. An
*Â°&â¢* oa Â°gÂ» 9<J^.tT>ifia>aa_trrjure < i
The Illinois rule has not found favor in
Pennsylvania. A. person was in the em
ploy of a contractor of a railroad com
pany and fastened a machine for sawing
wood to the railroad track in such a man
ner as to be Injured. He was there, how
ever, by the authority of the superintend
ent. The defense was that ho himself was
negligent, but he contended that if he waa
the company was more so. The court of
review made short work of this claim.
"The parties being mutually in fault,
there can be no apportionment of the
damage. The law has no scales to deter
mine in euch cases whose wrongdoing
weighed most in tha compound that
caused the mischief."
In another case of an Injured employe
the Judgo charged the Jury that if his
negligence contributed In any material
degree toward the injury he could not re
cover. The Supreme Court declared that
the charge was wrong, and that he should
have said that if his negligence contrib
uted in any degree to cause the accident
he could not recover. In other words, tha
negligence could not bÂ« measured,
weighed or apportioned between the par
ties. Justice FaxBon said that this had
always been the rule in Pennsylvania.
"This is a safe rule, easily understood,
and cannot well be frittered away by the>
Jury. But If we substitute the word â¢ma
terial* for the word 'any* we practically
abolish the rule, for a Jury can always
find a way to avoid it. We are not dis
posed to allow it to be undermined."
In one other case against a railroad In
which both parties were negligent, the
Judge attempted to leave the question of
comparative negligence to the Jury. But
the Supreme Court said he did wrong.
"We have repudiated oftentimes attempts
to draw the line between contributing acts
of negligence in fixing their consequence,
and have always held that in such cases
neither party can recover from the other.
This is the rule of the common law, as
old as the common law itself, and rests
on the solid reason that one man has no
right to recovor from another for conse
quences attributable In part to his own
wrong."
Consequence of Using Defective Ma
chinery.
Passing from tha consideration of this
principle, another will be mentioned re
lating to the working of defective and
dangerous machinery. There may be
gross negligence on tha part of tha em
ployer in having it, but the courts every
where hold that an employe ought not to
uae It, and if he does he is guilty of such
negligence as prevents him from recover
ing from his employer. This defense
was made by a railroad in Missouri to an
action brought against it by the wife of
an employe who was killed In Its service.
The court remarked that "there may be
cases where a servant would be wanting
in due care by incurring the risk or In-
Jury In tha use of defective or Imperfect
machinery or apparatus after he. knew It
might cause him bodily harm, but we do
not think this case is one of that class."
The Illinois Rule in Other States.
The California Rule.
Let us then turn to the rule of measur
ing the negligence of both parties. In the
trial of the Jacobs case by the Supreme
Court of Illinois in 1S58 Mr. Justice Breeze,
after reviewing many cases on the ques
tion, concludes thus: "It will be seen from
these cases that the question of liability
does not depend absolutely on the absence
of all negligence on the part of the in
jured person, but upon the relative degree
of care or want of care, as manifested by
both parties, for all care or negligence is
at best relative, the absence of the high
est possible degree of care showing the
presence of some negligence, slight as it
may be. The true doctrine, therefore, we
think, is that in proportion to the negli
gence of the employer should be measured
the degree of care required of the em
ployeâthat is to say, the more gross the
negligence manifested by the employer
the less degrea of care will be required^ c>f
the employe to enable him to recover.
The California Rule.
The rule In California la worthy of
note.. If the negligence of the employe
amounts to the absence of ordinary care,
if it shall contribute proxlmately or prin
cipally to the injury, he cannot recover.
The rule was applied in the following
case: A man was driving hla wagon
slowly toward a railroad crossing. A
locomotive came along, frightened his
horses and they ran away. Lumber was
piled up on either side of the street bo
that a dfiver could not see an engine un
til he was very near the track- lTurther
more, the engine bell was not rung, as
the law required. The Supremo Court, in
reviewing the case said: "A very timid
or cautious person would not, perhaps,
have driven in the direction of the rail
road, knowing that a train might pasa
along the track, and that the warning
bell might not be sounded. But the ques
tion is. Did the traveler exercise ordinary
caxe and prudence in doing what he did?
The degree of caution required is relative
to the rest, but no person is bound to as
sume that another will abandon any rea
sonable precaution. He would have had
no right to close hla eyes had he been in
a position to see the track, but this he
could not do until he reached a point very
near it." Of course, this principle ap
plies to employers and employes as well as
others.
The Proportioning of Negligence.
And here we stop to remark that one of
the reasons why the courts have been so
busy in buildinjr up a fortress of law for
the protection of employers is their fear
of the action of Juries if they "were left
with power to decide more Questionsâ to
roam over a wider plain. Their inclina
tion to give verdicts in favor of employes
is proverbial, and also large damages. On
the other hand, is it not true that the
narrowing of their functions leads directly
to this Tesultâ that whenever they get a
chance they are bent on improving it? We
have no doubt that if Juries had been
more considerate and impartial courts
would have been more inclined to keep a
wider field open for their inquiry and de
cision.
V II f
(Second Paper.)
In some States an attempt has been
made to measure or compare the negli
gence on both sides and then award judg
ment in favor of the least culpable. This
doctrine has been derided by some courts;
It has been adopted In Illinois and Geor
gia and is gaining ground. Such a strong
principle of Justice underlies , It that it
commends itself to many. On the other
hand a principle of this nature that Is to
be administered or applied by an un
trained Jury is apt to be abused. Such &
body of men, without training:, with
strong: likes and dislikes, sympathies and
prejudices, are quite unable, in many
cases at least, ta weigh and compare the
evidence relating to such a question.
Doubtless if Judges alone were to apply
the rule the courts would regard It with
more favor.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
Captain Meyer Married.
The pilots have been having a lot of Ju
bilation among themselves during the last
few months. Captain Fred Jordan's
"baby" up to some months ago was 16
years old. Now there is another baby in
the house that has put the 16-year-older's
"nose out of Joint." The same thing hap
pened in Captain McCulloch's family, and
now Captain Louis Meyer has gone and
got married. The bride is Miss Minerva
Lyon, and her friends have not yet got
tired of congratulating her. Captain
Meyer is one of the most popular of the
pilots, and all his friends join in wishing
him many years of happy wedded life.
Captain Freeman, who was carried away
on the Titania, is on his way home. Ajs
eoon as the big collier reached Nanaimo,
B. C, Jean Btarted back for San Fran
cisco.
When Captain Mattison of the schooner
Bertha Dolbeer wrote to this city that he
saw a ship disappear on December 22 the
chances are he was correct as far as he
went. . Insurance men, however, think
that the gallant skipper was so busy
minding his own business that he had not
time to notice what became of the ship.
If a 230-ton schooner, flying- light, could
live out a 90-knot gale, it seems hardly
probable that a ship under short canvas
would go down. Then Captain Mattison
says she was -only two miles away, and
yet he cannot tell whether she was a
bark or a ship or had three masts or four.
Just the same, the rate of reinsurance
on vessels bound for the Columbia River
has advanced. The rate on the Rath
down, now out ninety-6ix days from Yoko
hama for Portland, has gone to 90 per
cent; on the Castle Rock, seventy-three
days out from Hongkong for British Co
lumbia, the underwriters are paying 23
per cent; on the Andrada, fifty-seven
days out from Santa Rosalia for Port
land, 15 per cent; Bertha, seventy-six days
from Wei-hai-wei for Portland, DO per
cent; Otto Gildemeister, flfty-four days
from Yokohama for Portland, 50 per cent,
and Cape Wrath, sixty-seven days from
Callao for Portland, 30 per cent. In the
majority of these cases, however, the
fears of the underwriters do not center
around the local storm, but around the
typhoon that raged off the Japanese
coast last month and came near wrecking
the transport Sherman.

Trouble on the warren.
There will probably be an investigation
on the army transport Warren as soon
as she reaches port. The following Is
from the Manila Times:
Georg-e H. Walsh and Fred Lawrence, first
and second butchers, respectively, of the trans
port Warren, and Louis Staph, night watch
man of .the same vessel, came into port In
irons, charged with selling the shin's stores
for their own benefit. They were arraigned
before Judge Whltsett at the San Fernando Po
lice Station yesterday morning and their cases
transferred to the Parian-street Court for trial.
None of them have been able to furnish the $500
ball required.
Chief Steward Pfeiffer preferred the chances,
through Quartermaster Captain Miles. He says
the evidence will show that the men have been
systematically robbing the Government for
tome time, taking advantage of their positions
to further their personal interests.
Chief Officer Murch of the Warren came
home on the Sherman, and Second Officer
Dahlstead has taken his place. The War
ren is now out ten days from Manila and
should reach here about the 25th inst.

Shipyards All Busy.
From San Francisco to Pujret Sound
there is not a 'shipyard that has not more
work to attend to than can conveniently
be got rid of In a year. Lumber mills are
going night and day. and from one end of
the coast to the other can be heard the
sound of the mallet, adze and ax. Of the
entire fleet that will be launched during
the next few months perhaps the hand
somest will be the barkentine Kohala.
now building at Bendlxsen's at Kureka
for Hind, Itolph & Co. She will be almost
a sister ship to the barkentine Hawaii,
and will be fitted out in splendid style.
The owners of the Kohala have other ves
sels building at Alameda Point. Grays
Harbor, Puget Sound and one In England.
The latter order was only sent abroad be
cause the firm could not get a builder on
the Pacific Coast "who would accept a con
tract, even at a fancy price.

The State Board of Trade met yester
day afternoon to discuss measures look
ing to proper representation of
California at the Pan-American Expo
sition to be held at Buffalo, N. T., from
May I .to November 1 of the present year.
It was the opinion of those present at
the meeting that every effort should be
put forth to have the State fittingly rep
resented at the exposition. It Is the inten
tion of those who have the matter of the
representation of California in hand to
lose no opportunity in giving to the world
at large an insight into the wonderful
mechanical and natural resources of the
State. ,
Secretary Kilcher read communications
from the Sacramento Valley Development
Association and the San Joaquin Valley
Association. Both associations will hava
representatives meet at Sacramento next
Monday and discuss the matter of having
a joint display at the exposition.
A memorial from the California Water
end Forest Association addressed to the
State Legislature, asking that the State
make an appropriation equal to that given
by the Federal Government to have Cail
fornia properly represented at Buffalo,
was indorsed.
The California Fruit Canners' Associa
tion and A. Repsold, representing the wine
men, promised to send displays to the ex
position. Arthur R. Brlggs of Fresno, rep
resenting the raisin growers, and J. Row
ley of the California Packers' Associa
tion, promised that the organizations they
represented would send displays to the
exposition without cost to the Board of
Trade.

the union, kept open aiter 6 o'clock, were
promptly made to close their doors.
Hereafter those stores which have agreed
to close will be asked to display the of

The clause reading "No person occupy

over this clause in the by-laws. W. Mac
arthur denounced several members of the
delegation as political officeholders. A.
DljeaM followed. He declared that the
former speaker had made a personal at
tack on him. He claimed that he did hold
an office In the City Hall, due to passing
a civil service examination, and that he
passed with 92 per cent. Dijeau Bald that
he was still a musician, but was forced
to work in the Recorder's office, as he
was unable to firet work at his trade.
After a discussion of over an hour and
a half the clause was stricken out by a
vote of 58 to 4G.

long discussion on the check system now
prevalent at Mare Island:

the California State Federation of Labor be
requested to call the attention of the proper
authorities at Washington to the condition and
request that action shall be taken to stop euch

tion with tb* death of H. Benjamin the
old auctioneer, was dismissed by Judge
Cabaniss yesterday, as no motive had
been shown and the defendant had not
anticipated the consequences of his act.
"There is no question." said the Judged
"that some person Insulted the defend

rate of transportation for workmen from
Vallejo to the navy yard. The exclusion
of the Asiatic race was also discussed at
length.
While the members were answering the
rollcall in the afternoon the name of
James Bowlan was called. He stood up
and requested to be allowed tho floor for
a moment. He stated that the Hackmen's
Union was in a very prosperous condition,
and was even In a position "to tie up the
dead." He explained later that a uniform
rate would be charged for hacks making
the trip to the cemeteries.
Later Bowlan Introduced a resolution
asking Congress to pass a law providing
that all persons employed In the construc
tion of warships shall be American citi

with rocks in the interest of temperance,
announced to-night that he will ask the
Supreme Court of the State to release his
â¢wife from the quarantined Jail of Sedg
wlck County on a writ of habeas corpus.
To-day he sought to get the writ from
Judge Dale of the District Court, alleging
in substance that the smallpox quarantine
was placed on the County Jail to prevent
the liberty of his wife on bail. Judge
Dale told him that he was "wasting his
breath" and informed him that he would
not hear the matter, but at the same time
stating that he had his permlslson to take
it to any other court he desired. Mr.
Nation then prepared his papers for the
Kansas Court of Appeals, but curiously
enough when he reached there, 100 feet
distant, that court Informed him that It

But for the charity of others the body
of Mrs. G. VS. Spooner, the child-wife who
passed away on Sunday last, would be
interred in the potter's field; but for the
sympathetic work of Mrs. T. C. Jenson
of 1028 Potrero avenue, the young woman's
remains might have been turned over to
a medical college to further the aims of
science and to satisfy the hard-hearted
and aged husband. The pathetic story of
the marriage of Corey L. Bailey of High
gate, Vt., to George W. Spooner, a man
old enough to be her grandfather; their
journey to this city, her harsh treatment
at his hands, her illness and then her
death has been told at length.
The sequel to the sad story of the un
fortunate girl remains to be told. Her
body is to be buried to-day In Cypress
Lawn Cemetery. Her aged spouse will
not shed tears over the new-made grave.
His interest in the woman whom he prom
ised far back in Vermont "to love and
cherish" has passed with the old .century.
He declines to pay a cent tdward her
funeral expenses and is Indifferent
whether the body is placed in a pauper's
grave or given to medical students.
During his wife's stay In, the hospital
Spooner did not comfort her. When In
formed that the child-wife's body had
been taken to the Morgue he snowed
an indifference that was cruel in the ex
treme.
It therefore devolved on Mrs. Jenson
to have the remains of the young woman
properly Interred. She appealed to Mayor
Phelan and other charitably disposed per
sons, and through their assistance was
able to have the body removed to the un
dertaking parlors or Bunker & Lunt'at
2666 Mission street. A minister will say a
few words over the plain pine board cof
fin at the funeral services, which will be
held from the undertaking parlors at 1
o'clock to-day.

The association adopted bylawB, which
set forth that the purpose Is to promote
the livestock interests of the Padflc Coast
and adjacent States and Territories. Any
person identified with the livestock in
terests of California, Oregon, Nevada.
Washington, Idaho, Arizona and New
Mexico Is eligible to membership. San
Francisco was desig-nated as the head
quarters of the association.
The association puts Itself squerely on
re-cord in favor of the leasing of the pub
lic grazing lands by Congress. This was
effected by the adoption of resolutions In
troduced by Colonel John P. Irish, which
txe as follows :
"Resolved, By tlie Pacific Stockmen s
Association, that the interests of the pro
ducers and consumers of meat, hides and
wool will be best served by a law of Con
gress to lease the ranges on the public
domain west of the nineiy-niuth meridian,
such leasing to be optional with counties
cud to be protective to the rights of min
ers, agricultural settlers and small stock
men, a? well as large.
â¢â¢Resolved. That this asociation urges
this policy upon Uie National Stock Asso
ciation and upon Congress."
To secure representation at the meet-
Ins of the National Stock Association
et Sail Lake City next week five persons
â¢were recommended for appointment by
the Governor, the State Board of Agri
culture and the agricultural department
of the University of California as dele
gates, three to be named by the Governor
and one each by the other appointing au
thorities, the delegate list including, as
rcccraniezLded, the follwing: F. C. Lusk,
John P. Irish. W. Mayo Newhail. Mr. Gll
christ of Oregon and Professor Hilgrard of
the University of California.
Concerning th* advisability of leasing
the ranges. Colonel Irish spoke at some
length, advocating the measure known as
xho Foster bill, now before Congress.
Miners had devised the system of claims
for miners, he said. Leave the ranges
to agriculturists and stockmen to devise
a system which shall be equitable. He
qncted statistics to show that under the
piesent methods the ranges are being
robbed of their forage and among the
consequences immediately observable
Â¦were the decrease in six years of the
range stock sent to the East by 60 per
cent, a large falling off in the exporta
tion of meat products of the United
States and a rise in the price of meat
consumed at home. The leasing system
was not new. It had been tried in Texas,
Â¦where the ranges are all controlled by the
Slate. Texas had found leasing to be a
success. During the past Eumner the
troubles on the ranges in the United
States had been more a.caite than hereto
fore. Fifteen men had been killed as the
result of clashes between the cattle and
sheep men; thousands of sheep had been
k'.Jled by being driven over cliffs. The de
vice of fencing in ranges and the acquir
ing of strings of land in actual ownership
around ranges to keep others away from
the ranges had failed. There was no way
remaining but the lease of the ranges.
Colonel Irish read the Foster bill and ex
plaJned some clauses.

Lewis Is about 63 years of age and Is
known as major. He gained some little
notoriety last May through his civil ser
vice appointment as a copyist In the Re
corder's office. He was discharged, how
ever, by Recorder Godchaux because of
incompetency, it being alleged at the time
that the high percentage attained by him
at his examination was through Influence.
Among the effects found on Lewis and
In his room were deeds to many pieces of
property about the water front and other
parts of the city. The police believe that
Lewis will have a hard time clearing him
self.
Darling's story is that he has known
Lewis for some time, ancl as a favor he
went for the deed. He claims to be inno
cent of any wrongdoing in the affair. He
was ordered detained until further inves
tigation. .
Yesterday afternoon Charles A. Darling,
an insurance solicitor, called at the Re
corder's office, and presÂ«nting a receipt
asked tor tho deed. He was arrested, and
when questioned told thaz he was acting
for Edwin Lewis. Soon after the police
located Lewis and brought him before
Captain Seymour. Ho claimed that the
transaction was legitimate and that he
could produce other deeds to prove it. He
was locked up in the CJty Prison atvalting
the return of Attorney Eisner, when
charges will be preferred against him.
On December 31 last a deed for a parcel
of land at the corner of Laurel and Jack
son streets was filed In the Recorder's of
fice at the request of Benjamin Lewla.
The document related the sale of the land
to A. A. Aaronson from Meyer Lewis, In
which name the property stood on the tax
books, though It belongs to an estate.
Milton Eisner, the attorney for the estate,
notined the police that the deed was a
forgery,, and Captain Seymour detailed
Detectives Reardon and Tom Gibson to
work on the case.
In the arrest of Edwin Lewis, an eld
erly man, well known in the city, the po
lice have laid bare what they believe to
be the plans ol a scheme which, If not
frustrated, would have clouded many
pieces of property in this city and caused
unsuspecting purchasers to give up large
sums of money for worthless deeds.

Mr. Davis and family are en route to
Boston, 'where both are well connected.
On landing they drove to the Palace and
registered. Davis had seen something of
the town on the way from the ferry, but
he wanted to see more, so having en
sconced his wife safely he started out to
walk to the Cliff House. His way lay
through the barroom, however, where it
became necessary to show what a boy he
was; and now maybe -he'll see Boston be
fore Seal Rocks.
Paul A. Davis, a middle-aged railway
contractor of highly respectable appear
ance and hailing from Singapore, whence
he arrived with his wife and baby on yes
terday's Oriental steamship Gaelic, gave
an exhibition of an Cast Indian jag in ths
barroom of the Palace Hotel last night,
which though exceedingly entertaining
from a spectacular point of view was a
trifle vociferous. The echoes of the court
were awakened by the sound of Mr.
Davis' hilarity and snatches of gay song,
tropic as trie land where Mr. Davis had
learned them,* startled the august empti
ness of the grillroom and reached even to
where Night Clerk McDermott plies his
labors.
Davis was telling anybody who would
listen and a great many who didn't want
to of what kind of iigure he cut in the
Singapore landscape. Of money he had
plenty and two bartenders got paralysis
shaking mint juleps, for which kindly
concoction Davis evinced a great par
tiality. He said they were the only things
that didn't grow or couldn't be made in
Singaporeâ they and himself. He ex
plained he was a native of Boston. While
demonstrating how a monster steam
shovel worked Davis was asked to take
a ride In the open air. He was kept at
the Southern station till a reaction set in.

"I had addlty and heartburn nearly
every day. and sometimes was alarmed by
Irregularity and palpitation of the heart,
but all this gradually disappeared after T
began using Stuart's I>yspepsia Tablets
and I can eat my meals with relish and
satisfaction which I had not known since
I was a gTowins boy."
The success and popularity of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets (a enormous, but It Is
deserved, and every druggist ln the United
Stares, Canada and Great Britain has a
grooa word for this meritorious prepara-
tion.
Is Often tlie Heal Cause of a Sour
Temper.
That the condition of the digestive or-
gans has a marked effect upon the char-
acter or disposition Is a truism as old as
the hills. Old Ben Johnson wisely said
"the pleasure of living depends upon tho
liver," and It is a fact wnich none may-
dispute that a sunny disposition mora
often results from a healthy digestion
than from any other cause.
Add dyspepsia, commonly called sour
stomach or heartburn, is caused by slow
digestion of food: instead of being prompt-
ly digested and converted Into blood, bona
and muscle. It lies in the stomach for
hours fermenting and decaying, creating
gases which cause pressure on the lungs
and heartrshort breath and general dis-
comfort and Irritation.
Such half digested food Is Indeed poor
nourishment for the body, brain and
nerves, and the result Is shown in Irrita-
ble tempers, unaccountable headaches and
that depressing condition usually calied
the "blues," but how quickly all these
disappear when appetite and digestion are
Laxative medicines only Irritate the al-
ready frrltated stomach and bowels and

and when any of them are lacking tne
trouble begins. The reason Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are so valuable and suc-
cessful in curing stomach troubles Is be-
cause they contain, ln a pleasant, concen-
trated tablet form, all these absolutely-
necessary essentials for perfect digestion
and assimilation of food.
Henry Kirkpatrick of Lawrence, Mass..
says: "Men and women whose occupation
precludes an active outdoor Ufa should
make it a daily practice to use Stuart's
r>jspepsia Tablets after meals. I have
done so myself and I know positively that
I owe my present health and vigor to
their daily use.

A BETROTHAL
a
Griffin-Follis Nuptials Are
The child for whom Mrs. Steinberg de
mands support is a little girl Etta, eight
ye*rs old. who is living in Xamsea with
her maternal grandmother. When Etta
was a year and a half old her mother
decided to start on a quest for the man
who deserted them, and left for New
York. The next day after her arrival in
the big American city Rebecca Steinberg
went out In search of work. The first
place she strucK was a large tailoring
establishment, and there they put her to
work sewing on buttons. For six years,
day in and day out. the Polish woman
remained in that same factory, always
sewing on buttons. Her earnings ranged
from $3 to $6 p*>r week. Out of this money
she paid out $3 a month for a room, sent
10 rubles ($5 50> per month to her mother
in Poland for tho support of her child and
saved sufficient to go to Texas, where she
had heard nor husband was.
"It was hard work saving eo much out
of eo little," Mrs. Steinberg explained.
"I ate only one meal a day usually bread
j and butter and coffee. Soon I learned not
; to require much food. I rarely ate meat,
! perhaps once a month, and never any
j thins: in the middle of the day. Finally
I I sot enough money to go to Texas, but
I when I got there I found my husband had '
come to San Francisco. The people for 'Â¦
! whom he worked in Texas, however, were .
I extremely good to me and helped me to
I get to this city. Trie lady with whom I
| am stopping now is a sister of the kind-
I hearted stranger in Texas, and she has
! promised that she will keep me with, her
\ during my stay here."
Mrs. Steinberg is 27 years old. After she
has compelled her husband to provio for
their child, she says she Is going back
as-ain to the New York workshop. "I
should likÂ»Â» to stay here in this kind,
j warm city." she ?aid, "but I do not know
j how to do anything but sew on buttons,
I and my friends have already told me
I there is no caJl for such work here."
1 Sinew his- arrival in this city Steinberg
: has done service with the volunteers in i
' Manila. His occupation here is that of a
. fruit peddler.
as soon as he was able. I never heard
from him from that day to this. I do not
love him any more." said Mrs. Steinberg
in conclusion. "How can I? I do not want
him to come back to me. I only want him
to support our child."

INVITATION TO McKINLEY
FROM REVOLUTION'S SONS
The defense did not at thÂ© outset deny
the actual shooting, but claimed that It
was justified, and to that end called Clin
ton as its first witness. He told the story
of the money Miss Abbott had sent him
as he told It at the preliminary examina
tion, and again declared he paid it back
to her. He was shown a bundle of let
ters, about thirty-five altogether, written
by him to the defendant, which were In
addition to those produced at the pre
liminary examination, and ho admitted
they were in his handwriting.
These letters were couched in the most
impassioned language and some were un
fit for publication. He addressed her as
'my darling-," Â¦Â¦querida inia," "my dear
est kid" and other endearing expressions.
In one of his letters he wrote: "1 long to
feel your warm kisses on my lips and
hear your soft voice whispering in my
ears that you love me." She had written
him that she had lost $22 In Kansas City,
and he replied. "It seems funny, Angle,
that you would sooner leave your money
lying around than trust me enough to
send It to me." In one letter he spoke of
buying a saloon and sending for her, as
he wanted her badlv.

"Abnormally low temperatures were general

damaged olives, lemons anj tender vegetation,
but on tlie whole the cold weather was re

manifest from the opening, which showed no
such congested buying with running sales of
enormous blocks at wide quotations as has been
the feature of the openings ever since New
Year's day. The realizing movement here was
taken up in London to-day, and. their opening
declines reached from 1 to 1H in a number of
internationals. Then came the invariable con
test between speculative forces in the form of
supporting orders and eharp blddlne up of
stocks newly brought forward into prominence.
Sucrar, People's Gas and Rock Island were the
principal sustaining forces at the opening. The
speculative contest was continued all dav with
varying fortunes. The greatest Irregularity and
most erratic fluctuations were among th*
grangers, coalers. Pacifies and some of the
trunk lines. These all had their early period of
strength and again were most prominent In the
late drive agalnrt the market. St. Paul rose
at ore time to 161 and fell back late in the day
to lt.CH- The declines from the highest in
other members of these groups ran from 2 to
3Vi points. The Southwestern railroad stocks
were the most consistently strong of any in
the list. The special strength in Missouri Pa
cific had a stimulating effect on the whole
group. This stock opened up a fraction and
inar.purated most of the rallies afterward dur
ing the day. It closed at 81>4, the top price,
showing a net gain of 5 points. The onls' news
to account for the rise was a published esti
mate placing the earnings of the company at
a high j*r cent of the stock. The final strong
rally of the market very materially reduced the
day's declines and lifted many stocks from 1 co
2 points above the lower level. Reading ral
li<-d 2V.. Talk of impending gold exports this
morning and some uneasiness over the unset
tled conditions of foreign markets were causes
inciting to the more cautious attitude of specu
lation. The halt in the upward course of prices
naturally induced some taking of stock 1 of the
recent rumors and ether motives for the ex
cited advances. This process of introspection
naturally had some sobering effect after the
speculative excess of the. late market.
The bond market continued Its irregular
character on a volume of business mucn less
relatively than that in stocks. Total sales (par
value) J4.3I0.OCO. United States refunding twos

NEW YORK. Jan. 8.â Trading in the metal
market to-day was along conservative lines
and confined chiefly to immediate wants of con
sumers. The only variation In the general list
was shown in the tin prices, falling off about
15)Q30 points, as a result of large arrivals and
sympathy with weakness abroad. The close
here wan easy in tone at $26 70<Jf26 S7V4- At Lon
don spot tin was 7s 6d lower at Â£120 10s, closing
weak at the decline. The rest of the list was
without change as to price or feature. Copper,
dull at $17 for Lake Superior and $16 62*i for
casting and electrolytic, while at London an
easier market prevailed, closing easy at Â£72 8s
9d. Lead and spelter both ruled dull and fea
tureless. English Iron markets were a shade
firmer, owing to an Increased Inquiry, and closed
at 57s at Glasgow and 49'-4s at Mlddlesboro,
while domestic iron markets were entirely des
titute of new feature and without quotable
change. .

tithe of their recent activity. They were ne
glected and dull, closing llepressed on New
York's attitude, except for Ertes and Readings.
Berlin bought Northern Pacifies and sold Read
ings and the others. London thinks that they
will .derive most benefit from' the Hill arrange
ment, which, It is expected, will be known in
New York to-night. The bank lost Â£70.000 gold
to India and Â£8000 to South Africa- The local
loan tenders are regarded aa successful. Th i
allotment means that only Â£400,000 of deposit
money will be taken off the market. The India
Government has resumed the purchase of silver.

Schlesinger to Introduce a Bill Ra-

Injuries.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 8.â Bert Schleslnger of San
Francisco will prepare and Introduce In
the Assembly a bill amending the section
of the Civil Code relating to damages for
personal tnjurles. The Supreme Court has
interpreted the law to be that a parent
of a child killed through the carelessness
of the employes of a railroad, for in
etance, may.' recover damages to the
amount only that the child's services
would be worth to the age of 21 years.
.The . purpose of the proposed amendment
.will be to make the award of damages
for the mental anguish suffered discre- ,
tlonary with the Jury. The present stat
ute and the Supreme Court decisions
based upon It have been generally regarded
by the people as grossly unjust and tend
ing to estimate the value of human life
on a purely material basis, and the meas
ure probably will prove a popular one.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â By a vote of
165 to 106 the House to-day accepted the
reapportionment plan proposed by the
Burleigh bill, which increases the mem
bership of the House during the next de
cade from 357, the present membership,
and the membership proposed by the com
mittee in the Hopkins bill, to 3S6. The
result was largely brought about by the
influence of certain Senators from several
Ox the larger Northern States, who threw
the weight of their Influence In the scale
in favor of larger membership.
When it became apparent that these
factors were at work against his bill, Mr.
Hopkins attempted to compromise by giv
ing an additional Representative each to
North Dakota, Colorado and Florida, but
his adversaries refused to compromise
after complete victory was assured. The
Crumpacker proposition to recommit the
bill for the purpose of ascertaining what
States abridged the right to vote to an ex
tent which would entail reduced represen
tation was defeated. 130 to 110. There w i.s
no rollcall on this vote, but a number of
Republicans voted with the Democrats.
Under the bill as passed to-day no State
loses a Representative and the following
make gains: Illinois, New York and
Texas, tnree pach; Mlnnesota,New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, tw'o each, and Arkan
eas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts. Missis
sippi, Missouri. North Carolina, North Da
kota. Washington, West Virsrina and Wis
consin, one each.
The bill provides that whenever a new
State is admitted the Representative as
signed to It shall be in addition to the
number provided by the bill. It also adds
a provision never hitherto incorporated In
a reapportionment bin. to the effect that
Congressional districts, In addition to be
ing "contiguous" shall also be "compact."
States wnich are allowed additional Rep
resentatives by the bill shall, by Its terms,
elect them at large until the Legislature
shall redlstrict the State.

BURLEIGH BILL
IS ADOPTED
OAKLAND, Jan. 8.-Frank Frairi,
who has lived in three centu
ries, began his third -century by
being taken to the Oakland
Receiving Hospital for treat
ment. He was found upon the street last
night in what was supposed to be an epi
leptic fit and was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where he was kept over night.
He was allowed to go â¢to-day. It was
while at the hospital that Frairi an
nounced he was 104 years of age. that he
had seen two centuries go and two cen
turies come and that he had lived in
three centuries.
He is undoubtedly a man of great age,
but his general physical condition, his
agility and his brightness of faculty
oaused the statement to be doubted by
ttte officials. Later, when fits children and
his nephews visited the hospital to ascer
tain the condition of the old man they
George H. Curtis, District Attorney for
the Northern District of New York, In a
letter submitted to the committee, reviews
these conditions and says it is highly im
portant that the Government be clothed
with power to direct that these prosecu
tions be instituted before such Commis
sioner In the district as it may elect, and
one of the amendments proposed -by the
bill has this object in view. The District
Attorney further says:
"The efforts of the Government are be
ing circumvented by the Sheriff, his dep
uties and by the United States Commis
sioner at Malone. "While we are endeav
oring to get the cases before other Com
missioners I have been informed that par
ties who are steering the Chinamen in no
tify the Sheriff of Franklin County at
what point upon the border they can be
found, and ho cr his deputies go to the
border and receive them, and then insti
tutr- complaint before Commissioner Pad
dock."
Â¦ Another amendment confines the war
rants of arrest issued by United States
Commiesioners for alleged violations of
the law to complaints made by Govern
ment officers, except in certain instances.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â Representative
Jenkins of Wisconsin to-day reported to
the House a bill agreed upon by the Ju
diciary Committee designed to correct
some of the abuses existing under the
Chinese exclusion act. The legislation
proposed was favored by the Attorney
General and is the outgrowth of condi
tions which have prevailed In Northern
New York, as a result of which many
Chinese have succeeded in unlawfully en
tering the United States. The Chinese are
made up of two classes; the first return
ing merchants Â»snd laborers, who have a
lawful right to enter the United States
and who come through the custom-houses
and are admitted without trouble; the
other class has no right to enter. They
are either smuggled across the border or
come openly across the border, to bo
taken before a United States Commission
er for trial. Since the Supreme Court de
cision that persons born of Chinese
parents lr. the United States are citizens
and entitled to re-enter without certifi
cates the number coming under the pre
tense of havlr.g been born here has con
stantly increased. Tho courts have held
that the decision ol the customs officers
on the question of citizenship are not con
clusive, and more than 300 Chinamen have
crossed the border into Franklin County
since January and have been taken be
fore Commissioner Paddock at Malone
for trial. The Government, however, has
failed to secure any deportations to speak
of in the trials before Commissioner Pad
dock.

Officers in charge of the recruiting work
for the army declare ! it will take . six
months to increase the army along the
lines of the bill now before Congress. Gen
eral MacArthur continues to urge upon
the Secretary of War the Importance of
keeping the Philippine force up to 60,000
men. The act of Congress which au
thorized 35.000 volunteers compels their
discharge not later than June 30. This
will necessitate the reduction of General
MacArthur's force to about 35.000 men by
the first of May. when the first regiment
to leave the United States will be ready.
Unless some arrangements be made for
sending regular army troops, now orga-
nized in this country. MacArthur may be
compelled to police the Philippines for at
least a month with an army reduced BO
per cent over its present strength.
This is the situation pointed out by the
War Department officials. They declare
Congress has already placed the War De
partment in a serious predicament, which
grows more dangerous with each day's
delay.
Secretary Root does not believe that
the first regiment to go to the Philippines
to relieve the volunteers can leave tho
United States before the first of May.
"There is no doubt whatever that the
majority of American people are in favor
of a small rather than a large standing
army. If a special force Is needed in an
emergency the American people are quite
willing to give the President authority to
call for it but when the emergency goe3
the special force shouid go with it.
"This is the opinion I have heard ex
pressed and I have reason to believe that
it prevails 1 in all parts ol the country and
among all classes of thinking men. except
those who are Interested Tn an increase of
the army because they will be benefited
thereby. Discussion of the army bill now
before the Senate consists very largely of
special pleadings. During discussions of
the bill in committee and on the floor of
the Senate, the committee room and tha
corridor have been crowded with army ol
ficers acting in their own interests. It
has not been a spectacle which could bo
contemplated with any satisfaction. The
army is all right on the field, but officers
should not be invited to the noor of the
Senate or be permitted to lobby for legis
lation which will benefit them person
ally.
"These are not pleasant facts to relate,
but they are facts which the public ought
to know. If the army bill goes through
and the standing army Is Increased as th,Â»
bill provides, it will be because the Demo
crats did not have the courage of tlieir
convictions and because the army officers
have lobbied for its support."
The War Department is very much con
cerned over the effect in the Philippines
of the delay by the Senate in passing the
army bill. It is declared that the grav
est conditions threaten the Government.
Yesterday It was said the delay will In
volve an additional expense to the Gov
ernment of $1,500,000. To/-day the officials
say the expense is of minor Importance
compared with the necessity of replacing
the volunteers to be withdrawn.

NEW YORK, Jan. 8.â Frank Moss, ex
president of the Board of Police Commis
sioners, speaking last night at the .Uni
versal Thought Salon at WInterburn Hall I
on the topic, "Things in General." blamed |
the men who buy special .privileges for'
municipal misrule in New York. lie ?a.d,
among other things:
"This unanimous pointing to poor Sen
ator Sullivan. Martin Engel, Percy Nagle
and Devery is suspicious. It is suspicious
that all the newspapers agree in attack

Itself points. to the particular vices of
gambling and disorderly houses. I am j
inclined to look behind and see what I
greater evil is shielded. The men who j
might start an organization to overthrow
Tammany are themselves guilty of doing
practically the same thing. The men who
have been building up this system, of cor
ruption know that tho men who are in
control in New York life are buying priv
ileges and are fattening upon the fruits
of special purchase privileges. *
"Devery is bad enough, but he is a mere
creature, a mere product. The Commis
sioners are as guilty as Devery, yet they
talk of taking one of them to be the sin
gle head of the department. He is the
very man who broke his faith with a
Chief with whom he had no fault to find
to put Mr. Devery where he is at the be

but he has done nothing. There has not
been a single trial, but he is not the ulti
mate criminal. He is the creature of a
system.

There are men in New York who are
great financial powers and who have, been
furnishing the brains for Tammany Hall
for years and profiting by it, and they
have been using the rough man who is
the nominal head to control the masses,
and they have given him the rough man's
price."
Mr. Moss described the enormous value
of the subways as an illustration of the
special privileges which he said a certain
few men were Interested In. and he said
that it was to protect In the enjoyment
of that monopoly that they maintained
Tammany and through Tammany pre
vented a construction of the pipe galleries
which would carry wires in competition
with the subways.
"This is the condition, yet the misera
ble public is amazed over dives and gamb
ling dens, and the holders of special priv
ileges slyly say, 'We'll see If we can get
the reformers to put in nomination for
Mayor some man who won't interfere
with our special privileges."
"One of the biggest builders in New
York said to me: 'If T were to tell you
some of my experiences It would turn the
city upside down.'
" 'Why don't you tell me?' I said.
" 'Oh, it would end me,' was the reply.
"What white-livered men we are In New
York. 1 have seen men turn pale when I
suggested that they sneak out. Though
vice is bad, it is not the worst thing. If
it was noffor corruption in business life
there would not be so much In politics.
One can be a railroad wrecker or an ab
sorber of corporations and tfe considered
respectable. The strife that is now on
will go on until a force of men who havo
patriotism and civic pride will redeem the
city."
To Purify Philadelphia.
If local leaders can be found to carry
on the fight, Bishop Potter will 'assist in
launching an anti-vice crusade In Phila
delphia and will speak at a mass meeting
at the Academy of Music In that city to
be held to-morrow night. ,
"I understand that Philadelphia Is In as
deplorable a condition in regard to its mu
nicipal government as is the city of-Nervr
York," said the Bishop, "and what is
more, Philadelphia is a Republican city.
It would seem, therefore, that municipal
corruption may flourish under the auj
pices of either party. This Is a truth
which both Republicans and Democrats
are bound to admit.
"A delegation of prominent citizens
from Philadelphia called on me some days
ago and asked me to speak in that city.
Thev told me that the city' was In Bad
need of an awakening of popular senti
ment and of reform in municipal affairs.
I said that I would gladly assist in any
movement which had for its end the ex
termination of vice and corruption, bjut I
declined to take an active part until I
knew that there would be local leaders
to carry on the fight. I expect to hear to
morrow if satisfactory arrangements have
been made."

CORRUPTION
AND PUBLIC VICE
The family referred to was named De
vin. whence the young jockey took his
name. The Devins were related to Su
pervisor George E. Bates. One day a poor
vroman appealed to the Board of Super
visors for financial assistance for herself
and children. Sflpervlsor Bates offered to
give one of them, a little boy, a. home,
and in this way the young Jockey came
into the Bates and Derln families and
firally into the custody of Boyle, under
whose guardianship he earned large sums
on the race tracks.
It was stated in open court by counsel
that Boyle- had disappeared from his place
t,t business in Oakland, and that a defal
cation had been committed. Boyle, it Is
Raid, will be required to account for $4000
or SjOOO of the young Jockey's earnings.
Boyle, who la ore of the bÂ»>st known
horsemen on the coast, was granted let
tern of guardianship over the boy a couple
of years ago after a hard fight waged by
the family which had undertaken to rear
him and which had not dreamed of the
money earning capacity of the boy as a
rider of fast horses.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 8.â The Grand
Jury of this county will probably be called
Â¦upon to Inquire into the matter of Thomaa
H. Boyle's guardianship of Frank Devin,
the well-known young: Jockey. Judge
Hughe* of the Superior Court to-<Jay
made an order directing that Boyle file
within ten days a new bond as gxsardlan
in the sum of $10,000, and that his power
as (guardian be suspended pending the ren
dering of an account. The Fidelity Surety
Company applied for release from respon
sibility for Boyle's future acts aa guard

of young Devin opposed the request and

HONOLULU. Jan. Lâ W. Horace
Wright, journalist, lawyer and leader
among the forces of the royalist party in
Hawaii, ended his life with the end of
the nineteenth century, committing sui
cide on the last night of the old year by
taking carbolic acid. He was found dead
on New Year's morning in his editorial
chair in the office of the Independent, of
which he was associate editor.
The suicide was evidently deliberate.
During the afternoon of the 31st Wright
purchased two small bottles of the poison
that killed him, giving the excuse to the
salesmen at the drug stores that he
wanted the stuff for cleaning. In the
evening he retired to his ofBce alone and
he was not seen alive again. When he
was found this morning a flask half full
of whisky was beside him. He had ap

and while others round him were cele

dose of the burning fluid. For over a year
he had been drinking very heavily and of

that he deliberately chose the end of the
century as a fitting time to close his
career.
The deceased Journalist was a man of a

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 8.â The Congrc?
sional committee which is investigating
the hazing of fourth-class cadets at West
Point military academy resumed the tak
ing of testimony to-day.
Harry Breth of Altoona, an elder broth
er of John Breth, whose death is also un
der Investigation, told of a visit he and his
sister paid his brother at West Point In
August, 1895, a few months after his ad
mission to the academy. John said he
had been exercised until he was rendered
unconscious and was revived with whis
ky. Harry said that hazing had become
so severe that extra guards had been put
on duty, and John said that such a pro
ceeding waa unusual. When the cader.
returned home after having been found
deficient in certain studies in 1898. h-Â»
seemed unwell and never Â¦ was In good
health after that. *,
Lucien Alexander, secretary of th*5
board of examiners for the admission of
law students to the Philadelphia bar, who
yesterday refused to give the result of
Oscar Booz's examination upon the
ground that he would be Â»n contempt of
the courts under a rule of the court, said
.he had applied to the Court cf Common
PlÂ«-as and the court had granted a rul<?
permitting him to make answer. He then
testified that Oscar Booz failed in the 2x
aminntion. having a general average of
50. Mr. Alexander said he attributed his
bad showing to Booz'a poor eyesight.
Harry Breth was again called and ex
hibited the letters written by his brother
when he was a cadet at West Point. In
one of the letters John said he had re
ceived a large number of demerits. , This,
he said, was not the result of careless
ness. The rules were very strict in re
gard to tidiness, but he had little time lo
keep his belongings in proper order, as ha
would be compelled tc neglect his duties
bv reason of his having to attend solree3,
which was one of the forms cf hazing in
vogue at the academy.. â¢
Another letter stated that one night
"some of the worst fellows in C company"
took John and three others to a tent and
forced them to undergo excessive exercis
ing. John was made lo "brace," "eagle."
"wooden-wlllle." put on a rain coat, and,
with a cap covering Ins head, hold out
dumbbells. * ' - -
Mr Breth, the father of John, said it
was his firm conviction that the excessive
hazing .his son .> underwent made him
chronically, nervous, broke his health and
reduced his vitality to such an extent that
the "young "mail .was unable to- fight, tho

The committee adjourned to meet at

testimony Â¦ at the military academy, the
committee will , return to Washington,
where other witnesses will be heard.

UNCONSCIOUS FBOM HAZING.
"W., "WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â The mili
tary court of inquiry which investigated
the charges brought by the parents of
Cadets Oscar L. Booz and John Breth,
deceased, has made its report. The court
finds that while Boob was hazed when
a cadet at the Military Academy, his
death was caused by tuberculosis, and
the treatment he underwent was not re
sponsible for the disease. The charges
made by the boy to his parents were un
true. Neither is there any foundation
for the allegation that Cadet John
Breth's death was due to hazing. The
court specifically finds that hazing has
occurred at the military academy, but
that it was not so brutal as has been
observed in civil institutions throughout
the country. In view of the fact that
the statute of limitations applies to the
cadets who participated in the hazing
of Booz, and because of the further fact
that the cadets who gave testimony dam
aging to themselves could not be prose
cuted on such testimony, a recommenda
tion Is Included in the findings that there
be no further proceedings.

QENIAL. Sam Thall, the well
known theatrical manager, is
once more in the city, and his
right hand is aching from .the
many, cordial greetings he has re
ceived from his legion of San Francisco
friends.* Thall is a San Francisco boy.
Twenty years ago Thall began his
theatrical career with Joe Grismer
and Fred, Bert, at the old Cali
fornia Theater, and the training he
received there has stood -him in good
stead, imbibing thoroughly the business
and practical aetalls ot theatrical work
from Urismer and, Bert, youngx Thall
started out on the road with Unsmer and
tor eight years piloted the ventures of,
this actor alt over the country. Both
U nail and Grismer boast that during the
eight years they were connected they
never closed a season with less than $20,
000 profit.' Thall's record was watched
closely by W. A. Brady, another San
Francisco boy, and a good offer from,
Hrady took Tnall to New York. This waa
s-hortly after the time of the defeat of
Sullivan by Corbett, who waa under
Brady's management. Thall managed
Corbett's theatrical company for Brady
and money simply piled into the coffers of
the firm. In fact, when any of Brady s
companies were "off color" Thall was
hurried on to join the company, for he
had the record of making a poor attrac
tion a paying one.
With the increase of Brady's ventures
Thall was advanced until he became the
general representative for booking and
routing the shows. Brady looked on
Thall as his "mascot" in all of his pugi
listic ventures, and says that if Thall had
teen present at the Corbett-Fltzsimmons
encounter at Carson the result would
have been different. Up to three years
ugo Thall remained with Brady and then
started in business for himself. "Yon
Yonson" came under his management, and
last year cleared $20,000 profit. This year
Thall has twd attractions on the roadâ

COMMERCIAL NEWS
They tell a story of a woman evangelist
who started in to convert Denver. Colo.
The house was crowded and many men
were present. She lifted a heavy hymn
book and said, "There Is a man In this
room who Is untrue to his wife and I am
going to hurl this book at his head."
Every man In the meeting ducked but one.
The evangelist, spoke kindly to that one,
but he was deaf and dumb.â The School
master.

YESTERDAY evening Mayor Phe
lan announced the various ap
pointments he had made to fill the
vacancies In the' city commissions
and boards, the list being as
follows:
Board of Public Works, Marsden Man

reappointed.
Park Commission, W. S. Martin, to suc
ceed F. W. Zeile.
Board of Health, Dr. W. B. Lewitt, to
succeed Dr. L. Bazet.
The appointees will serve for four years.
AI chough It was understood that the
Mayor would give out the list last Mon
day morning there was a delay caused by
the opposition to the name of Marsden
Manson, whom Mayor Phelan desired to
reappolnt on the Board of Public Works.
During the last year Commissioner Man
son has clashed frequently with some of
the Supervisors over the question of the
manner of paving certain downtown
streets. The Supervisors serving on the
Committee on Streets urged the Mayor to
appoint some one in place of Mr. Manson
with whom they could work In harmony.
It was generally understood that all the
Commissioners whose terms of office
Martin, however, Is a personal friend of
the Mayor.
Walter S. Martin, the new Park Com
missioner, is a native of San Francisco, a
graduate of Georgetown College, Wash
ington. D.- C. He is the son of Mrs.
Eleanor Martin and nephew of the late
Governor Downey.- Colonel Martin, who
takes his rank for service on the staff of
Governor Budd and also that of Governor
Gage, went to Manila as a volunteer aid
on the staff of General Charles King. U.
S. A. Colonel Martin has an Independent
fortune, bequeathed him by his father,
his uncle, Governor Downey, and his
aunt, the late Mrs. Peter Donahue.
Dr. W. B. Lewitt was born in Ann Ar
bor, Mich., and graduated from the De
troit Medical College in 1S77. and from the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, New
York, in 1S78. He arrived in San Francis
co in 1878 and became connected with the
medical department of the University of
California In 1879. as demonstrator of anat
omy, and later became professor of anat
omy, which chair he held until 1S90. Since
1S90 he has been professor of surgery .in
the dental department of the University
of California, and also associate professor
of diseases 6t children In the medical de
partment. He has been a member and
also president for one year of the board
of examiners of the Medical Society or
the State of California. He Is* a member
of all the most prominent medical so
cieties In the city and State and also of
the National Medical Association. He is
at present one of the visiting physicians
to St. Luke's and the Children's hospitals.
Colonel J. R. Howell is a member of the
well-known real estate firm of Baldwin &
Howell and Is a member of the Governor's
staff and a well-known Elk. He has al
ways been Identified with public affairs
and Is a progressive man of Ideas. He Is
36 years old and has spent most of his life
in this city.
would expire would be reappointed with
the exception of F. W. Zeile of the Park
Board and Dr. L. Bazet of the Health
Board, both of these gentlemen having
informed the Mayor that they would de
cline to accept a reappointment.
The Mayor was averse to making public
his list of appointees in an incomplete
condition, and yesterday afternoon he was
closeted with Colonel George Hv Mendell
of the Board of Public Works for two
hours, evidently in the hope of arriving at
selections to suit all parties.
In the afternoon Mayor Phelan was
waited on by Colonel Howell and by Pres
ident Mark of the Board of Education,
each gentleman emerging from the
Mayor's private room with a signed com
mission In his possession.
The consultation with Colonel Mendell
lasted until 6 in the evening, at which
hour the Mayor consented to make public
the list of appointments for new Commis
sioners, as already stated.
Regarding the appointment of Mr. Man
son on the Board of Public "Works. the
Mayor says: "If Mr. Manson was not ap
pointed the Mayor would have to appoint
another Non-Partisan, but could not ap
point a straightout Democrat, because the
charter provides that not more than one
Commissioner shall belong to the same
political party."
In selecting Colonel Howell to succeed
Dr. McNutt on the Police Commission the
Mayor feels that it was an opportunity
to introduce new and young blood into
the administration.
Dr. Lewitt. who succeeds Dr. Bazet on
the Health Board, was stated by the
Mayor to be agreeable to the other mem
bers, and Dr. Bazet declined to accept
another term of office, as he is acting po
lice surgeon. â¢
Concerning the selection of W. S. Mar
tin to succeed F. W. Zeile on the Park
Board the Mayor had no comment. Mr.

A sad scene was enacted yesterday at
the general hospital, In which a mother,
calling at the hospital to welcome home a
son returned from the Philippines, found
that he had Just passed" away. David L.
Brodek, a private in the Fourth Cavalry,
suffering from the dread dysenteryt was
sent home on the Sherman, but unfor
tunately the disease had taken too firm
a hold on his system and the voyage failed
to benefit him. When he arrived at the
hospital he was very' low, but it was not
expected that death was su near. Word
was sent to his mother, who resides in
this city, that he had arrived. The mother,
who for weeks past- had been scanning
the papers for news of her so-n, received
the tidings with tears of~Joy and hastened
to, the Piesidio. When she arrived there
and announced herself as. the mother of
the' sick soldier a silence fell over the
group of hospital corps men in the oiRoe.
i-uiniliar as they were with death and
suffering, not ono of them wanted to tell
the expectant mother that but a moment
or two betore'/ier arrivui the son had ex
pireu. "When it was finally told her tne
poor woman refused to believe the state
ment, insisting, despite the tender man
ner in wnlch the taie of her son's death
was repeated, that he was still in the nos
pital. ' \S hen linaily it dawned upon her
that she never again would see ner boy
her anguish was terrible to behold.
Strong-hearted men who have witnessed
Buffering and death in Its worst forms
turned away. The suflering ot a mother
bereaved was more than they could bear.
The dead soldier was a resident of San
Francisco, but had been in .the army for
a number "of .years. He had a brilliant
record, and was one of the best liked men
in his company. He will be buried from
the general hospital to-day with military
honors.
Orders were- received yesterday at the
recruit camp to get ready for service in
the Philippines ail the assigned recruits.
They will sail on the transport Grant,
which leaves this port on the 15th lnst.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Carroll D.
Buck has been ordered to temporary duty
at the general hospital, awaiting trans
portation abroad.
First Lieutenant Herman A. Sievert.
Fourth Cavalry, has been assigned to
duty with the recruits in Model camp.
Captain Edward G. Beeson, assistant
surgeon, Thirty-ninth Volunteer Infantry,
has been ordered to duty at the general
hospital. The duty is but temporary-, as
he is under orders to proceed to the Phil
ippines.
The following named acting assistant
surgeons have been ordered from various
points in the East to duty in the general
hospital while awaitlrg transportation
abroad: John II. Allen, Henry D. Brown,
William F. Graham, Lawrence McEvoy,
Frederick II. Mills, Joseph Pettyjohn,
Richard J. Price, Joseph W. Reddy and
Shannon Richmond.
A detachment of fifty regular convales
cents is being formed at the Presidio for
duty at San Diego Barracks. It will be
commanded by Lieutenant John P. Hains,
Third Artillery, and will leave here about
the 12th inst. It is proposed to make up
the detachment of men whose speedy re
covery will prove of benefit to the service,
and in accordance with this idea a large
number of non-commissioned officers will
be sent.
The six hundred and odd recruits occu
pying the Model Camp at the Presidio will
be Inspected by General Shatter this
morning. Constant drilling haa rendered
the men fairly expert; lnfact, most of
them when put to the test act like vete
rans. Care has been exercised In select-
Ing the non-commissioned officers, those
in charge choosing where possible men
who have teen service before, with the
result that the officers In charge of, tha
camp feel confident that the Inspection
will be a source of satisfaction to the
department commander. The men drew
new -clothes yesterday, and the neatness
of the new outfits will add not a little to
their appearance.

The trustees of the San Francisco
Chamber < Commerce made It plain to
Dr. J. H. White, assistant to the Surgeon
General of the United States, at a meet
ing yesterday afternoon that they wished
to have Dr. Kinyoun removed from his
position as quarantine officer for this
port. Men prominent In the commercial
life of tÂ»ie cite were present, and told Dr.
White of matters that had come under
their personal observation, citing these to
show how Dr. Kinyoun has, on more than
* one occasion, so acted as to drive away
commerce .rum the port and to create
a hostile feeling against San Francisco.
There was no mistaking the word3 ot
Captain Charles Nilson, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, when he said:
"We don't want to eay that Dr. Kin
youn ha? tried to injure our city, but we
do eay that for a long time he insisted
that there was bubonic plague here, and
It was a burden upon the city. We do
not believe that Dr. Kinyoun or the
lJoard of Health ever saw a case of the
bubonic plague in San Francisco. They
never found any symptoms on any but
dead persons. The report that ' we had
the piagvie was sent out broadcast and
caused us much damage. The railroads
are still unable to deliver freight in Texas.
We wish the Government to look Into the
several matters of which we complain.
Dr. Kinyoun has lost the good will and
the conndence of the people of San Fran
cisco. 1 believe he can be more useful in
come other city ti:an in San Francisco.
When a man becomes obnoxious to a com
munity he is of very little use there."
LÂ»r. White, at the outset, denied that
he came to San Krancisco by reason of
the. resolutions sent by the Chamber of
Commerce to Washington, and said that
the resolutions could not have reached
Washington until live days after he had
started for the Pacific Coast. He claimed
that his only business here was to exam
ine all the quarantine stations. His mis
sion had no special relation to Dr. Kin
youn.
Secretary Scott then read the statement
exude by Captain Hinder of- the Coptlc
concerning the examination of his pas
sengers m. n quarantined here. "I have
been in every part of the world," deposed
Captain Kinder, "and I have never seen
euch treatment of passengers elsewhere."
Alfred J. Marcus, president of S. H.
Frank & Co., also tuld of the treatment
of the Coptic's passengers in quarantine.
J. H. Claymore followed. It was made
plain by them that the passengers were
examined publicly and without due re
gard either to privacy or to cleanliness.
Captain Charles Minor Got-dall of ihÂ»
Pacific Coast Steamship Company told
of steamers coming from Victoria being
unnecessarily delayed; of the harm done
by the reports persistently sent out by
I>r. Kinyoun about bubonic plague; of
the reflations which prevent Chines*
from journeying- to British Columbia and
Alaska by pea, and of delay on the part of
the Quarantine Officer in acting on com
munications.
Captain Ooodall told of efforts made
toy him to communicate with Dr. Kinyoun
on the â¬th of last month by telephone,
when he could not reach him. A letter
xvas then written to Kinyoun on the 7th.
No answer was received until the 11th.
The communication referred to passen
gers. Business could not be done that
wa^f. Captain Goodall objected to me
fr.ar.ner in which the quarantine la con
cucted by Dr. Kinyoun. and said any law
could be enforced In a technical way to
interfere needlessly with Business. The
Collector of the Port could so act as to
stop all business. That was what Dr
Kinyoun had been dolnp.
John A. S. Lowe, manager of R. Duns
inuirs Sons Company, complained of the
hardships inflicted by Dr. Kinvoun on the
ccal carriers between British Columbia
and San h rancisco. Henry Rosenfeld also
complained of the same general matter
read the official regulation! and claimed
Dr. .Kinyoun was going outside of these
reKuiatior.a.
