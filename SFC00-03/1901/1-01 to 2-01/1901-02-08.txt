As a spectacle, the procession preceding the marrlageVwas
not noteworthy. Fifty Dutch Hussars rode ahead. Then came

Henry. The Queen Mothers coach came. after It, -and. .then 1
the chief military officials of the palace, the Governor of ;the

mounted artillerymen. The progress was slow, because, the
procession was frequently obliged to halt while the cheering
populace made way. . Green and orange decorations, with thou
sands of Dutch flags hanging across the -.streets, gave the
route a brilliant appearance. The costuming of the crowd s was
equally high colored. Tho windows and housetops' were

to participate. These who stayed at their homes in

The ceremonies were the same simple rites of the Reformed
church by Â¦which the. humblest of Queen Wilhefmlna's sub

and democratic, although the costly gowns and jewels^ and
the showy uniforms of distinguished personages, high officials
of the kingdom, . the army and the navy and representatives
of the people in Parliament and the municipalities furnished
a regal stage "setting. The venerable pastor, administered to
the bride and groom a caution that their high positions would
not shield them from the common sufferings and sorrows _of
humanity. . ; Â¦ i
Queen Wilholmina made a very winning and human bride.

Boers and British in Cape Colony. It is
announced here that the Imperial Gov

The three men and Pauline Spawn were
bound over to the Superior Court for
trial. Dogan and Hansen were picked
up to-day and are also supposed to be im
plicated in the robberies. Detective
Smith believes that one of the prisoner*
is a noted criminal from the Middle "West,
wanted on many charges, including peni
tentiary breakmg. An attempt will be
made to establish his identity to-morrow.
Hannah Wildgrube. a pretty girl of 1<>.

and meetings, describing the return of the
men after the Smith burglary, when Wil

On reaching the house Wilson boosted
Clark up on the front porch, Harbers
keeping watch for them. Clark pried
open the front room window, where Paul
ine had informed him the strong box was
kept which contained the diamond* and
sealskin. Mrs. Smith's cries for help
alarmed "Third Vice President" Wilson
and Harbers and they ran down K street.
Clark made his way through the houso
and got out the front door. According to
the confessions, the three men. the two
girls and Ed Funk all met In the Capitol
Saloon afterward.
According to her confession Pauline told
Clark and "Wilson that Mrs. Smith had
J1C0O worth of diamonds, a sealskin sacque
and valuable underwear. On Saturday
night the projected robbery was talked
over and Detective Smith has learned that
"Wilson, on behalf of the gang, went to
a Tacoma man and asked him to dispose
of the diamonds and sealskin, agreeing
to bring them to him on Sunday 1 night at
S:30 "o'clock. On Sunday afternoon Paul

This matter of punishments is one for
which it is practically impossible for the
Chinese commissioners to assume respon
sibility, as they have made no recommen
dations on this point themselves, although
they have forwarded all threats made by
the foreign representatives. They freely
state that they arc? afraid the court will
refuse to comply with the demand for tha
beheading of certain princes and officials,
in which case the situation must imme
diately become grave. However, nothing
can be definitely predicted in regard to
the outcome until the Dowager Empress
answers the telegrams of her envoys. If
she offers to compromise by giving a few
minor heads it will show she is frightened
and her ultimate compliance with all de
mands may be looked for. However, if
she is defiant and refuses, then..the.,pow
ers will probably force matters. , In such
event the possibilities are too serious for
speculation.

Minister, after the adjournment of the
joint meeting with the- Ministers. During

informed Earl Li and Prince Ching that
China must give the heads askÂ«d for or
there would be no peace. This, in con
nection Â¦with a similar statement made by

The dead woman was the Baroness
Josephine Myer. She was the daughter
of Baron Myer. a rich banker of Dres
den, Germany, where she was born only
twenty-seven years ago. While her father
was Â«. Jew, her mother was an English
lady, Miss Watson by name, and the sec
ond wife of Baron Myer. Later, while
Jiving in England the family name was
changed to Myrr-Watson, by which a
surviving brother of the deceased is
known. When about 2 1 ) years of age she
became the wife of Count Ritter, a com
modore in the Oerman navy. * She was
subsequently divorced from him, and soon
afterward made her first visit ta America-
While in New. York she married Fred
erick Hamsch, a former employe of
Ooley & Stokes, on Wall street.
ThÂ» frantic young husband seized the
tracking revolver from his dead wife's
hand and attempted to end his own life.
TYiends restrained him. but hi? grief is
pitiable and it is feared hfs reason will
be dethroned.

feeling well, and excused herself, leaving
the gentlemen at cards. A moment later
they were startled by the report of a
pistol, and found Mrs. Hamsch dead on
the floor of her room with a bullet hole
through her temple. The bullet was
found on the bed a few feet distant.
The months went by and recently it was
announrf-d that the Hamschs had given
wp Stone Hedge and would live at the
Oountry Club. A house was engaged in
town in which to store their furniture,

All at or.ee the Countess disappeared.
For more than a year nothir.gr Â¦was heard
from her. Several months ago 1 " she re
turned as MrÂ«. Hamsch. accompanied by
her husband. The fiurry died out quicker
this time, for she was no longer "the
Countppp," but simply the wife of genial
Frederick Hamsch. The couple took pic
turesque old Stone Hedce and again -set
tled down. The Fame lavish expenditure
of mor.^y was resumed and both to a cer
tain extent entered society, for Mr.
Hamsch was a polo and golf enthusiasm,
tLnd fond of jrayety.

opposed to it, Mahonev was in the same
position and there the matter ended. Dr.
McNutt'a impression, however, was that
the. plan was going to bÂ«s given a trail with
or without the- commission's approval.
When the plan was presented to the Po
lice Commission Mayor Phelan presentel
the plan and Captain Wittman described
the workines of it. Dr. McNutt had no
further material testimony to offer and
was excused.
Qwong Jim, the Chinese to whom Mayor
Pholan referred, was placed on the stand,
but he became so tangled and unsatisfac
tory in his testimony that a recess was
taken in order that an interpreter might
be found.
HOW THE PHELAN PLAN '
MET ITS SUDDEN DEATH
Police Commission Would Not As
sume Responsibility of Killing
Crime by Illegal Acts.
The afternoon session produced some
important data in the investigation of th*
methods of the Police Department in deal
ing with Chinatown affairs and the social
evil. Judge Wallace, one of the Police
Commissioners, testified that he thought
that Chief of Police Sullivan was honestly
trying to do his. duty, and that the Com
missioners at no time decided to do any
thing but what was perfectly within tha
law. Qwong Jim, a Chinese, who acts as
Inspector of electric and gas lights in
Chinatown, caused hearty laughter b" h:a
evasive questions when detailing how he
approached Agent .Darby Of San Jose, who
represents Mayor Phelan, in the proposi
tion to secure immunity from the' police
in this city's Mongolian quarter, and Dent
Robert, managing editor of the Examiner,
let the cat out of the bag by bluntly 12s
tifying that after search for a ' scoop he
decided to run Chief Sullivan, and the
Polico Department, and the -Chief spollei
the "scoop" by giving the evening papers
the information that Sergeapt Maho.ney
had been removed from command of the
police squad In Chinatown. Â¦Â¦.Â¦ /
While the commission was at lunch a
deputy sheriff searched for Rev. Dr. John
E. Gardner, the Chinese interpreter and
United States Chinese Inspector, attached
to the Chinese Bureau maintained by the
Government. â¢ .
When the commission resumed work In
the afternoon Qwong Jim < was not present
ond the commission decided to examine
Judge Wallace, one of the Police Commis-
Judge Wallace could give but little in
formation to the committee. He did not
remember if on December 27 last, or at a
subsequent meeting of the Police Commis
sion, the question of licensing Chinese
gamblers and the regulation of the social
evil was diBCUssed. The Judge- stated
that he had read of the matter -in .the
papers, but It had made no particular
impression upon him. â¢ -
Â¦i.-"There had been some- talk;" said
Judge Wallace, . "of getting the laws
changed. I myself thought that it might
be a better plan for ; the authorities to
have the power - to regulate or prohibit
the evila. * I made some remarks on the
subjeots At the meeting of the Commis
sioners, but made -no -speech. . I stated
that it was Impossible to stamp out the
social evil and it would be i better ; for the
police to have the power.to regulate it
While my ideas were expressed, I stated
that we had no power to do this and that
we: must obey the laws in every par
ticular ;: I told the Mayor and CWef Sul
livan that wo could only \obey the laws
No vote was taken on the matter at any
of the meetings of the commission."
By- Mr. Knowlandâ "Did. you have a
conversation Â¦ with Dr.' McNutt about De-
iner people sent to me and asked me to
use my Influence to defeat Judge Dainger
field for the nomination of Superior
Judge. This I refused to do and this ex
plains Â¦why the Examiner has been ham
mering away at us. ever since. This,
however, should not deter us from accept
ing favors even from the devil and 1 am
here as well as you to" learn what I
can."
"Did you make a compact with the man
aging editor of the Examiner," asked
Knowland, "to make Esola Chief of
Police?"
"There Is no truth in the story of a
compact." said his Honor. "It was un
derstood that I was to grant favors to the
Examiner and Esola was its candidate for
Chief of Police. The managing editor
and Esola were close friends, but I had
given no promise and made no compact;
it was simply understood that Esola was
to be promoted. When opposition was
made to his promotion tho Examiner was
enraged. We were begged to make him
Chief of Police if only for a day. We
were told that he would resign the next
day, but we could not afford to do It.
Other than this there was no compact be
tween the Examiner and me."
"Do you believe there is corruption in
Chinatown?" asked Knowlanu.
"I do not," was the reply. .-.'*.;
"Then you would be surprised, Mr,
Mayor, If proof were given of police cor
ruption in Chinatown?"
"No. sir, I would not be," replied the
Mayor. "Chinamen will attempt to bribe
everybody who may. be of advantage to
them. That Is why wo wanted to estab
lish the licensing plan. We wanted to
protect the public and police as well as
keep the Chinese in subjection. W T e
wanted these offenders to know that they
do not have to pay the policeman on the
beat. The plan was simply tentative. I
share the general Impression that Chi
nese are great bribers and policemen are
human. There may be some bribery in
Chinatown and we want to get at it."
"Then you believe that there is bribery
of police in Chinatown?"
''No, I do not say that. I have no more
opportunity of knowing than you have.
I have simply as a foundation common ru
mor upon which you are acting."
â¢*Have you ever received any informa
tion that bribes were being given and
taken in Chinatown?"
"I have not. . The place has been con
sidered a danger &pot and should be
looked after. There were some newspaper
rumors, but no proofs that were worth
presenting. We had a general belief that
where men had power to break down
doors and arrest people Indiscriminately
thfcre was alwÂ»ys some danger of them
being approachÂ¥d."
"Why did you refute to appoint Esola?"
"Simply because of the public clamor
and tho noise of the other newspapers.
It was not a fight to a finish with usâ the
commission and my3clf. We realized that
Esola was not a big man, had a poor edu
cation and had serwd in a small capacity
in the department. We saw that If chosen
Chief of Police his every act would be
misconstrued and so we let him go."
"When you were reorganizing the Police
Department was there any suggestion
that Captain Wlttman â¢ bo reduced in
rank?"
â¢There was some suggestion of that sort
from the Examiner, but from no one else,
I believe."
"Do you remember that scandal once
was around his name?"
"I do,, but I have forgotten the connec
tion."
"Do you know whether or not he was
then vindicated?"
dence, but hoped to see" the money pass.
That is all I know of the affair. What
the police did can best be told by Mr.
Robert."
Mr, Williams was followed on the wit
ness stand by Police Commissioner New
hall.
. Â«Â¦'-
VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF
POLICE DEPARTMENT
Comrnissioners Repudiate Attack and
Express Confidence in Integrity
of tha Various Officers.
Mr. Newhall somewhat sorrowfully de
clared that he has various occupations.
He said that he is a Police Commissioner J
and a farmer.- What necessary associa
tion he has established between the two
ho did not announce. He then related
something of his efforts to Induce^ the
various newspapers to indorse the "pro
posed plan of licensing gambling and
social vice. He declared that. the Chron
icle agreed without reservation, 'the Ex
aminer accepted the proposition with a
reservation against gambling, and The
Call', through its manager, had no ob
jection and practically gave sanction, al
though the manager declared that he
must consult the proprietor before giv
ing ilnal answer.
"Did the Police Commission," asked
Knowland, "ever give to Chief ' Sullivan
any implied or direct power to go. ahead
und test the plan which because of il
legality had been abandoned?"
' "The commission gave no such author*
ity."
"How long have you been a farmer, Mr.
Newhall?" asked Schllllg.
"All my life," was the reply.
' "Do you still believe that the Police
Department is honest?"
1 "I certainly do."
"Do you believe that "the laws of the
State are being violated In Chinatown?"
"Most assuredly I do. As far as
gambling and the. social evil are con
cerned tne laws are being violated. But
the police are doing their utmost to "sup
press gambling. I have made several In
spections of Chinatown and feel that the
Police Department is doing its best in
the matter. I believe that tne proper and
responsible method for conducting this
investigation is before the Police Com
mission. 'If the Examiner were honest
and not prejudiced against the depart
ment, and had .legitimate charges â¢ to
make, it would have presented its accu
sations to the commission." 1
"And do you believe that the Police De
partment la above reproach?"
"I believe that It Is absolutely above re
proach."
Commissioner Newhall then told why
he had â¢ voted tb elect Sullivan Chief of
Poltco. - Efforts had been made to get an
army officer, but without success. Sulli
van Is admittedly a man of absolute in
tegrity and sincerity: of purpose and for
that . reason ' was elected, he | having . of
course'the capacity-to master the details
of the police administration. Newhall was
then excused and ex-Police Commissioner
Dr. McNutt took the stand. â¢
Dr. McNutt was .asked the . question
which by. repetition has become familiar
and somewhat tiresome. The committee
is seeking: to discover. whether or not tha
Phelan plan to license ctlme 1 was unoffi
cially Indorsed by the Police Commission.
Several witnesses have testified most em
phatically â¢ that when the plan was ' aban
doned as illegal -absolutely no effort was
made to revive 'it either officlallyor un
officially. Dr. McNutt U testified' as the
others. had done that the commission de
termined to have nothing whatever to do
with It. . .
He declared' that if the Chief of Police
had decided to eo ahead with , the 1 plan
he would have to do so; at; his own risk.
Judge Wallace, the witness said, was also
cember 27?" A. â "I cannot remember.
Dr. McNutt is a friend of mine and I al
ways talk to him when I see him."
Q.â "Did you tell Dr. McXutt at any
time that if Chief Sullivan wanted to try
this plan he could do so on his own re
sponsibility?" A.â "I don't remember
having done so."
Judge Wallace then told of how Mayor
Phelan had called on him and discussed
the question of the Judge's appointment
as one of tne Police Commissioners and
that he, the Judge, had told the Mayor
that if a better man could be found he did
not wish the appointment.
The Judge could> not remember if at any
meeting of the Police Commission It was
decided to give a trial to the plan of
regulating Chinese gambling and the
social evil.
Judge "Wallace in reply to questions by
Mr. Knowland said that he favored an
amendment to the Penal Code by which,
in large cities, tho police could have the
power to regulate gambling and the social
evil.
"I realize." said the Judge, "that It is
impossible to prohibit these subjects and
it is better for the police to have the
power to concentrate them and have them
under supervision. I have but few sug
gestions-to'make pn these questions but
I think that they ought to be treated with
common sense."
Qwong Jim was the next witness callett
and. he never even relaxed his features
when some of his answers brought rounds
of laughter from every one in the room
Qwong understands English, but it suits
his purpose to "no eabe" whea it comes
Ho talking about Chinese gambling and
so he was questioned through Rev. Dr
fh a e rd c n e"- S tÂ«^l h^n?u| kS "^ dlaleCt3 **
When asked through the interpreter if
he understood the- rr.nctlty of the oath
administered to him In the morning
Qwong Jim said no., und Chairman Know
1 n !?T r d ,, caused a hearty laugh by saying.
"Well, swear him again."
The oath, which hes no meaning to the
S nt Conf V, ciUfl ' wah then administered
and Qwong Jim was put through a rigid
examination but not the slightest direct
evidence could be secured from him. Suf
ficient was. however, secured from him to
learn, what every one knows, that gam
bling exists in Chinatown.
The more important part* of the ex
amlpation of Qwony Jim wer% ns follows:
_ Q.â Do you x knovr Mr. Darby of San
. Â¦ A,->Yes. I do. He is the rent collector
of tho house where I do business there.
I . have been his tenant for. about ten
years.
Q.â Did you telephone to Mr. Darby to
come to S.in Francisco? â¢
A.â I telephoned to 'my partner in San
Jose to find Mr. Darby and tell him I
wanted to see him la San. Francisco.
Q.â When was that?
A. â About one year ago-.
Q.â Why did you send for him to come
to San Francisco?
- A. â Because he knew a partner of mine
who desired to land In this country and
Mr. Darby could identify him.
' Q.â Were there any other reasons? â¢
i A.â Yes.
â¢I Q.â What were they?
A.â It is bard to remember.
Q.â Can you recollect any of the rea
sons?
A.â Well, we talked about the conditions
in Chinatown and the doings of the police
in Chinatown.
â¢ Q.â What reference was made to the
polico? :
A.â We talked about the police becaus
they had been breaking down doors and
some Chinese came to me and asked me
to sec Mr. Darby, wno knew the Mayor
because they wanted Mr. Darby to see
the Mayor and hava the Mayor make tho
police more lenient.
. Q.â Did you tell Mr. Darby that yOu"
would pay him $200 per month to secure
police immunity in Chinatown?
"I do not. I know, nothing of the matter
except from what 1 have read since Its
occurrence." â¢
"Do you believe that an officer who
has been under suspicion should be in
trusted with responsible duties?"
"If we didn't," replied the Mayor,
"most of us, I think, would be hit.'"
METHODS OF POLICE IN
THE CHINESE QUARTER
Chief Sullivan Was Agked to Believe
Without Proof that an Officer.
Was Dishonest.
"Do you know whether or not any of
the officers of the department have be
come rich in their service?"
"I have never heard any member of the
department accused of being rich."
"Do you or do you not know that Chief
of Police Sullivan v.as given power to put
the licensing plan into operation without
receiving authority .from tho commis
sion?"
"I do not know. I think you might get
that testimony from the commission. * I
have been informed that Chief Sullivan
has arrested every malefactor. This is,
of course, a part of the plan, and a most
important part, but it. is not the whole
plan. Under the enUre plan we would
have to receive the c6-bperation of Po
lice Judges and even of the,- arrested peo
ple themselves." â¢ Â¦"
"Is the plan In operation now?"
"No. The police are arresting every
offender and all of . them will Â¦â¢ get their
turn. If the Police Judges do their duty
punishment- will be' given. ' The essential
feature of tbe plan is of course' elimin
ated; the police have no agreement with
the Police Judges."- â¢
The inquiry then turned to the Sullivan
property iri Chinatown. Mayor Phelan
declared that his â¢ brother-in-law, Frank
J. Sullivan, owns a. tenth interest in the
property, which has not been favored by
the" Board of Public Works more than
any other in- Chinatown. The property,
being: In" the heart. of Chinatown, Is sub
ject to the conditions of Chinatown, but
there is no gambling on the premises.
There'ls one lottery place, the Mayor is
informed, , The income is only $1120 a
month.** The property Is-leased to a Chi
nese who has only to pay his rent and
Mr. Sullivan has only to spend his share
of it, which would be only $100, as he has
only a tenth interest In the property.
"Do you think the- lease of property for
immoral purposes would be void on the
score of public policy?" . â¢
"Certainly, if specified in tho ! lease.
Otherwise It would not be so."
At this point Mayor Phelan was ex
cused. The' Investigators were as far as
ever from a- direct trail leading to a sub
stantiation of the accusations of bribery
in Chinatown. â¢ . . . ffigftq
T. T. Williams, business managerÂ»of the
Examiner, was the next witness. He tes
tified that he had received information
that Sergeant Mahoney was collecting
money from Chinese. "I consulted." he
said, "with the managing editor. We be
lieved that Chief of Police Sullivan is an
honest man. We invited him to a confer
ence, told him what we thought and what
we expected to prove. He said he wanted
to catch the offender and would do every
thing In Ills power. I told himthere could
be no question of police corruption, and I

"We believed that Mahoney was corrupt.
Any man with twenty, or twenty-five as
sistants could ftop gambling if he wanted
to do so. In asking Chief Sullivan to meet
us we. felt we were dealing with an. hon
est, -square man, and If he were put. on
the track of wrongdoing in Chinatown he
would stop it. We did not have our evi-
AT the opening of the -morning
posslon of the investigation the
courtroom was crowded wrth
officials, politicians, prominent
citizens and beneficiaries of the
Mayor's bounty. All came in
anticipation of 'some sensatlon
nl testimony from the Mayor, and they
were not disappointed. His Honor un
bosomed himself and told how he and the
Examiner made politics and government
for the people of San Francisco. Mayor
Phelan made the frank confession that he
â¢felt obligated to give the Examiner cer
tain favors for having apsisted him. He
declared that he sought to go as far
as he dared to satisfy these obligations of
his newspaper partuer, and In doing this
found himself in a peculiar predicament.
The Examiner wanted him to force his
Police Commission to appoint Fred Ksola
Ohirf cf Police, and he did all In his
power to obey the command until public
indignation and protest forced him to de
sist. The Examlnpr then insisted that he
rÂ« tain Gc-orge Maxwell as secretary of the
Fire Department in order that Sam Rai
ney might kc op his hold upon the depart
ment as a formidable political machine.
Mayor Phelan Â»aid he balked at this
command of his partner and then the
Examiner, claiming partnership and
mastership of him. yelled fraud
and shoutod that he had violated his
compact. The Mayor paid there waB no
compact, pimply an undemanding that
the Examiner would l>e favored. He In
sisted, however, upon the removal of
Oeorge Maxwell, and the breach between
his Honor and the Examiner widened.
But" the Examfner was insatiable. It
fMT!? to drive its chattels for all they
are worth. Mayor Phelan says the Ex
sminor then demanded of him that he
defeat Judpe Daingerfield in the conven
tion for the nomination for Superior
Judpre. This he declined to do. and now
the Examiner wants to punish him for
his violation of contract.
This was the shameful story of news
paper indecency and official complaisaney
and connivance which Mayor Phelan re
lated yesterday morning. The public has
h* ard much of it, but for the first time
yesterday it received a definite, authorita
tive statement of the character of the
pcandalous compact from one of the par
ties to .the deal In which public interest
was to be sacrificed to private advantage.
When Mayor Phelan took the stand he
was asked a few minor questions on
another subject.
"In your testimony yesterday you Fpoke
of an attempt by a Chinese to bribe of
ficials. Do you know the name of the
Chinese?" asked Knowland.
"I do not, but I can get It," was the
Mayor's reply.
â¢'Do you believe that the rumors of cor
ruption published In the newspapers are
true?"
"There are presumptions against the
truth of anything emanating from that
source."
"Will you kindly pet me the name of
the Chinaman who offered a bribe to your
friend?"
The Mayor did as he was directed. The
name of the Chinese was given as Wong
Jim, and later he made his appearance In
court. Mayor Phrlan then turned to a
discussion of hSs political partner, the Ex
aminer. In this discussion the thought
which has bex-n an undercurrent in this
Inquiry came to the surface. The Exam
iner was placed in the guise of a prose
cutor against :he Police Department. This
opinion v.as greatly strengthened by the
attitude of Assemblyman Webber, who
has acteri practically a.s a special prose
cutor. Ho was, unfortunately, absent yes
terday. The examination of Mayor Pne
lan Mas conducted by Assemblyman
Knowland.
"Do you believe," asked Knowland,
"that the Examiner Is Inspired by any
malicious motivâ¬ in this matter?"
"I most certainly do." replied tpe Mayor.
"The Kxaminer attempted to run Ban
Francisco and failed. It was not In the
position of an elective off cer and toad no
responsibility. It therefore" exceeded its
functions, which I conceive to be the pub
lication of the news. It suppressed news
end manufactured what it was pleased to
call news. It Is now seeking to vent Its
fplte upon the Police Department."
"Since we have entered Into this discus
sion of newspapers," said Knowland. "will
vou tell us what were your relations with
the Examiner?" . i S â¢.'/;.
PHELAN CONFESSES THE
POLITICAL CONSPIRACY
Exposes the Greed of the Examiner
to Rule the Vote Machines
of the City.
"From the time of my first candidacy
for Mayor," eaid his Honor, "the Exam
iner was very friendly to me and espoused
my cause. We got along very well to
gether until after I was elected Mayor
under the charter. The Examiner then
wanted favors, and I was ready to grant
,them within reason. The Examiner want
ed several things. It wanted particularly
fa have Influence in the Police Depart
ment, and presented Frederick L. Eso'.a
os its candidate for Chief of Police.
"I waÂ» willing to give the Examiner
t>eople what I could in reason and in con
sistency to the public good. When I was
elected Mayor under the charter the Ex
aminer assured me that Chief of Police
I>ecs must' be removed and that Fred
Esola must be his successor. The candi
dacy of Esola was bitterly opposed by the
other newspapers, and while I was will
ing to do much for the*Examiner, I was
not ready to go that far to oblige it. The
Examiner was very much disappointed
when Esola did not get the place.
"Then the Examiner people insisted that
Ceorge Maxwell remain as secretary of
the' Fire Department in order that Sara
Rainey, with whom the paper Is friendly,
might retain his power over the depart
ment. I insisted that for the good of the
fen-ice Maxwell be removed." When this
was done the Examiner declared that I
had made a bargain to retain Maxwell.
This, however, was not the truth.

on which the convention met, the Exam-

Chinese Trickery.
In response to further questions Qwong
Jim said that he did not proposrs to nee
Mr. Darby for any one's interests besides
those of I.p So. The witness admitted
that on account of his knowledge of Eng
lish he frequently acted for Chinese la
their dealings with white men, but "never
with the police."
"1 often act.'d for the Chinese with
their attorney, Joe Dunne. "When people
were arrested their friends asked me tn

Qwons Jim was then questioned by Mr.
Wright, and in reply the witness said that
Lo So had died two weeks ago. When

saying that Lo So's body had been
shipped to China, but the witness could
not name the ship on which the remains
of Lo So were Kent home.

Q.â How do you know that?

the Chinese gamblers who control things.
Q.â Do the head men raise money for
immunity?
A.â I don't know of any particulars.

done?
A.â I don't know it so that I can testify
to it. I never raw it with my own eyes.
I cannot testify to what I have not seen.
(Loud laughter.)
Q.â Have you heard of it being done?
A.â Yes. I have heard such reports. They
were circuited on the streets in China
town. I cannot remember the names of
the people who spoke ot it.
Q.â Were reports freely made among the
Chinese? â¢ Â¦/_
A.â Yes. the matter was freely discussed
in Chinatown.
Q.â Whom were you to act for In the
matter of sepinrr Mr. Darby of San Joae?
A.â For Lo So.
Q. â Where does he live?
â¢ A. â He died about Â¦ two -weeks ago. (A
hearty laugh followed this reply.)
The secret is out. Mayor Phelan has confessed that for services rendered
Jte agreed to bestow important and valuable -political favors upon the Examiner,
and that one of these favors zvas the control of the Police Department by the Ex
aminer. This startling admission zvas made yesterday by Mayor Phelan at the
legislative inquiry into the affairs of the Police Department. The Mayor declared
that he found his agreement to barter away the gifts of his official position a very
difficult one to keep.
The Examiner zvas exacting: It acted as if it had bought something and
orroganth it demanded the delivery of its purchase. Its managing editor de
manded the position of Chief of Police for his friend, and Mayor Phelan says he
-zi'ould have given it to htm had it not been for public clamor and the opposition
cf other newspapers. â¢ .
Continuing in his revelation of a secret deal, zvhich zvas shameful to all con
cerned, Mayor Phelan then declared that the Examiner insisted that George Max-
Â¦well be retained as secretary of the Fire Department, in order that its friend,
Sam Rainey, might not lose cmitrol of the department as a formidable political
machine. Again the Mayor could not grant the importunities of his newspaper
Â¦partner and again he zvas subjected to abuse. Undaunted, the Examiner re
~mained at his heels demanding payment for zvhat it had given.
It asked of Mayor Phelan that he use his official and political influence to de
feat Judge Daingerfield for the renomination for Superior Judge, but the Mayor
declined to interfere. These arc the reasons which he gave yesterday for 1 the attack
upon thc~Policc Department and himself. The public has suspected that such a
compact 'existed betzveen Mayor Phelan and his newspaper associate, but nozv
there can be no doubt of it. Mayor Phelan has confessed that for favors granted
he made a compact with the Examiner, and by the terms of that compact his offi
cial' sheet'' expected him to do dishonorable things. And in this confession Mayor
Phelan contradicts some of the most important public utterances he ever made.

Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ - . - . Â¦ ..-â¢Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢';Â¦; â¢ ...
The;: investigation of the 'Assembly Committee has thus degenerated into a
bitten' controversy betzveen the Examiner and Mayor Phelan. D. H. Robert of
the 'Examiner added to' this phase of the affair yesterday by admitting that Its
and thelpaper he represents arc antagonistic to Chief Sullivan because he would
not give exclusively to .the Examiner the nnvs of the removal of Sergeant Ma
honey from '.Chinatown... .And the only reason that the Examiner demanded such
a favor zvas because its .representatives told Chief Sullivan that they believed
Mahoney to be dishonest. and hoped some day to prove it.
As far as the main, ostensible purpose of the investigation is concerned ab
solutely no progress'zvas made yesterday. The investigators are as far nozu from
establishing police blackmail in Chinatown as they were in the beginning. A
Chinaman swore yesterday that he once offered a bribe to an agent of Mayor
Phelan, but the' agent refused it and the matter zvas dropped. That is as close as
the investigators have got to a proof of official bribery or bla&mail.

nouncement that it has been definitely de
termined that King: Edward will open his

slipped it on the same finger of the Duke's right hand. Th*?n
as the chaplain raised his arms in the attitude of blessing, tb.5
couple sank on their knees and there was, a great rustle of
relief after the tension of long listening throughout the cfcureh.
The invocation was brief. The only words distinguished
were the names of Queen Wilhelmina and Duke Henry. This
ceremony had evidently not been rehearsed, because at its con
clusion the Duke started to rise and was almost standing when
thrf chaplain motionod him back and he dropped on his knees
again, turning very red and remained kneeling while another
hymn was sung with heads bowed low. The words of this hymn
were:
"Father, look upon them always in love:
Son of the Father, errant them your grace:
Tliy communion and the spirit of God be their portion forever."
Queen ilhelmina and Duke Henry rose as the wife of the
chaplain handed them a large, blue-bound Bible, in accord
ance with Dutch custom. They then walked back to their
chairs and the audience resumed their.seats with them.
EECEIVE THE BENEDICTION.
The Queen and Duke sat. glancing at one another occasion
ally, while the choir chanted the last verse of the hundred
and thirty-third Psalm. Finally the royal couple arose for the
benediction. After the invocation of the blessing of the Fath
er, Son and Holy Ghost there was a moment's hesitation and
the Duke stepped forward, grasped the chaplain's hands and
shook them cordially. The Queen followed him and also shook
his hand, with.no air of royal condescension, but with a
grateful smile. The minister bowed low over the hand of the
Queen, who bowed lower, almost kneeling.
- After this, without any family greetings, the procession
quietly re-formed and passed down the aisle, while the choir
sang a hymn of Schiller's to Gluck's Joyful music. Before the
nymn was finished the last couple of the royal family was gone
from sight, and with a great chattering and handshaking the
congregation poured Into the aisles and hurried to the doors
for a sight of the procession returning to the palace.
Outside the big state carriage, in which the Queen's mother
rode, with six black horses drawing it. was just rolling a.wa'v
and the military band was playing the "Washington Post"
march, while cheers and shouting filled the air.
Luncheon was given in the palace after the church cere
mony, the two families, the Ministers of State and the wit
nesses attending. The tables were loaded with state plate gold
and silver, and beautifully decorated with white flowers. The
Queen's mother toasted the young couple and Prince Heinrich
responded. The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg pronounced a
toast to which the Queen's mother responded.
The Queen and Prince Henry have bound themselves by
contract In accordance with the statutes to recognize the hus
band as the head of the matrimonial union and to provide for
and educate the children of the union. The husband assumes
the responsibility of representing the wife in all civil actions
and of administering her property, except as he is restricted by
the marriage contract, by the terms of which he renounces
any right to sell or mortgage her landed property.
The wife promises to obey the husband, but by a special re
cent act of the Dutch Parliament she is exempted from the
usual promise tp "dwell with him wherever he deems it best
to live." The contract also provides that the Queen shall al
low the husband interest on 50.000.000 guilders, and that he
shall receive no income from the state except in the case nf
the Queen's death. â¢
To-night the populace was like a multitude of happy chil
dren. Thousands swarmed through the principal streets
which were nearly impassable, blowing horns, singine the
national hymn, following the bands, smashing hats and lan
terns. Aged housewives with their husbands, from the
provinces joined hands with stylish city folk and danced to
the music of street organs. There was considerable mild
nilarlty Inspired by wine, but no offensive drunkenness. Sail
ors, fishermen and" farmers wore their usual quaint costumes
and a few soldiers mixed with the crowds.
At tfie Haliveld entrance to the Bosch a display of fire
works was in progress. On all the principal streets were il
luminated portraits of the Queen, Prince Heinrich. the Queen
Dowager and Duchess Maria, as well as the national arms
A noteworthy feature of the holiday season was the entire
absence of extortion on the part of the hotels and shopkeenere
and the warm-hearted hospitality with which all strantrer^
were received. The Dutch journalists rented the former
Austrian legation, one of the handsomest houses in the citv
and made a club for foreign correspondents, -who have been
the recipients of universal kindnesses. Â¦
CHEERS . FOR' MR. . KRUGER.
UTRECHT. Feb. 7.-This day was a general holiday in honor
of Queen Wilhelmlnas marriage. A crowd assembled in front
of Mr. Kruger's hotel and sang the Transvaal anthem. Mr
Kruger appeared at a window and was cheered. " * *
were court officials In dark blue uniforms with gold epaulettes
and broad lacings of gold across their breasts and down their
trousers, wearing swords and carrying chapeaux. They were
ail stalwart, handsome men. ." _;
A large section of the kerk-on the extreme right of the pul
pit was empty, headed off by high oak panels, decorated with
palms and evergreens.
WOMEN IX GORGEOUS GOWNS.
The seats, except a few chairs within the altar rail, were
filled an hour befor-i noon. From che tremendous pipe organ
occasional strains of music floated out. solemn hymns, with
nothing of the traditional joyous wedding spirit in them.
A' roar of cheers announced the arrival of the bridal party
at half-past 12. They entered the main door, in the vacant
wing of the church, walking up the steps on a strip of red
velvet, under a red and buff canopy, bearing the arms of Hol
land, and proceeding along the nave, through a lane of palms,
to the aisle between the Burgomasters and civilian guests,
fifty feet long, which was draped with blue displaying tne
orange lion.
Before the wedding precession entered the church the great
congregat?on arose and the choir of 100 voices sang, in six
parts, to Hildack's music, the words of the sixteenth and sev
enteenth verses of the first chapter of Ruth: the blue cur
tains were held aside by the court officials, and to this music
the party slowly marched down the aisle.
First came a dozen couples of royal and noble relatives Â¦ of
the bride, men in spectacular uniforms, women In rich col
ored gowns, with a great array of jewels. Then, on the arm
of Duke Henry, walked the Queen, in white silver and green,
a heavy diamond tiara on her head, a rich necklace of dia
monds on her neck, with a big diamond brooch on her bosom
and white gloves to the elbows. In both hands she held a
bouquet of lilies of the valley and green, red and long white
satin ribbons.
The Queen and the Duke bowed slightly to the right and
left, acknowledging the salutes of the congregation. Tne
groom ' wore the uniform of a Dutch admiral, and carried ills
chapeau. Mor^e noble couples walked behind.
When the party entered the chancel the Queen and Duke
Henry took the two central seats of six, with the Duke's
mother on his rightâ a red-faced, stout dowager, gowned *n
white patin trimmed with brown fur and embroidered with
gold. On her right sat Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia, a tall,
bald man with gray side whiskers, resembling the Emperor of
Austria. The bridegroom's brother, a tall. German-looking
Prince, with a light blonde mustache, also in uniform, sat on
the Queen's right. On his right was the Queen's mother. The
other members of the royal families were sealed in rows of
chairs to the left of the altar, while the court chaplain. Dr.
Van der Vlier, a slender, aged man with gray whiskers, arose
in the regulation blacK gown behind the railing and offered a
long prayer In earnest tones. Then the choir sang a Dutch
hymn, "God bless you: Blessed be your earthly and eternal
portion."
The Queen bowel her head low. and the chaplain addresseJ
ths bridal couple for ten minutes earnestly and solemnly.
The only sound which marred the impressive scene was the
sharp clicking of photograph cameras in the press gallery fac
lnÂ£ the royal sextet, .ill of whom noticed the disturbance and
looked annoyed. The Duke fidgeted nervously and blushed un
der the gaze of the congregation, hundreds of opera-glasses
Deing turned in his direction.
The choir then sang another hymn, during which the congre
gation stood, according to Dutch custom, aa those present did
all through the hymns.
QUEEN REMOVES RIGHT GLOVE.
After this the Quaen a.nd the Duke arose and the Queen re
mcved her right glove, disclosing an immense Jeweled bracelet
on her wrist. The minister stretched out his arms and the
couple stepped forward a few paces dlrectlv In front of the
altar railing, standing on the embroidered arms of their fam-
The Queen had handed her bouquet to an aged lady in wait
ing, who laid it on a chair and arranged the folds of her mis
tress gown, which trailed clear across the velvet rug, with tha
gauzy, white veil hanging over it.
Duke Henry took the bride's right hand. For several min
utes they stood there, the sun streaming on them from the
windows of plain glass and thousands of eyes fixed an
them from the ranks of the strong, solemn-faced Dutch minis
ters and burgomasters, the deep, impressive tones of the chap
lam's voice ringing throughout the church as he repeated the
marriage service.
The Queen stood very erect, blushing. DakÂ© Henry shiftai
his feet nervously and played with his sword. The response
from the bride or groom could not be heart. Finally the min
ister held out a cold plate, from which the Duke took a ring
and placed it on thÂ« third finger of the QucÂ«n's rlgrht hand.
The Queen took another ring, with a slight fumbling, and

A sale of tinioii-
made suits at $7.85
. February has the reputation *of being the dullest month in the year as
regards business ; indications point to mnexception. But being forewarned is
being forearmed, so we have made concessions that will liven trade a bit
in. our locality.
We have taken a line of suits- that formerly sold at $10.00, $12.50 and
$1^.00, and actually marked the price down to $7.8^. The reduction is big, to be
sure, and rather unusual, but we are anxious to be kept busy, and values like
these make a steady customer out of every purchaser. _^
The suits are single and double breasted sacks, :|S|Tmn^D<^SSiHmls I
i cut in the very .latest style and made from good all- | S U-vUr^^^^^ssal fin
wool material in dark and light effects of cheviots* ;3o '
and tweeds, in grays, olives and mixtures; the lot 'IH Â«Â«â B Bi
contains everybody's size up to 44 . J
â¢ A particular feature of the suits is .that they are
\mion made - '
As union labor is the best, you naturally get it in these suits. The wearing
of a suit depends very much upon the making. In addition to the union label
the suits bear our .
"Yeargood'V Label
I which is our own personal guarantee that protects you. The suits are made in
our own factory and we speak of them through an absolute assurance that the
garments are properly made.
Remember, the sale starts to-day, and the price is ;

ORIGINAX SCHOOIi BILL
Amendment Follows Amendment and
Adjournment Puts Stop to
. Wrangling.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 7.â The school bill present
ed by Senator I-ardner came up* for a
second â¢reading to-day, and the Senate
was still workinc on It when the hour
for adjournment came this afternoon, and
by that time the bill looked as if It had
been attacked with an ax. It was amend
ed in half of the thirty-four sections anl
several of those left untouched by amend
ment were stricken out altogether. Tho
bill is one that in its original form gave
great power to a County Superintendent of
Schools. In one place it provided that he
should name candidates from whom the
Supervisors should appoint the School
Trustee's, but this wan amended out of thÂ«Â»
bill. In another he was required to pass
upon the plans of school buildings and the
contracts for their erection, but this. too.
was amended, and in a third place he waj
required to pass upon all supplies, but
this, too. was shorn from him.
. The election of School Trustees was
changed from July to May. and the elec
tion of teachers was so limited as to mako
it impossible for the outgoing board to ap
point teachers for the ensuing year, and
so bind the incoming board to keep em
ployed teachers not of their own selec
tion. It was found, however, that thin
amendment as adopted amended too. much
of the bill, so the amendment was recon
sidered, and the Senate was still wrang
ling over the rew amendment when the
adicurnme'nt was taken.
The bill was made a special order for
to-morrow morning, and when It has been
finished there will not be much of it re
maining.

Shortradge's Amendment Excluding
â¢Christian Scientists Meets De
feat in Senate.
CAIAj IIKADQUARTKRS. SACRA
MENXP. Feb. 7.â ShortriÂ«l^e"s amend
ment to the Assembly bill regulating the
practice of medicine and surgery was
voted down in the Senate this morningâ
ayes 9,. noes 19. The amendment wns
drawn to exclude Christian Scientists
from the restraints and penalties of the
bill.
ShortrldRe spoke earnestly in support of
his amendment. lie said osteopaths and
Christian Scientists would be prevented
irom practicing. The Christian Scientists
are numerous, sincere and honest, Shori
rldge said, and their ranks embrace many
intelligent ana distinguished persons.
Simpson also supported the amend
ment. He believed in tho right of every
person to choose his own doctor and
method of treatment. It was- wrong? â¢ to
put the control of medical practice in tno
hands of a privileged few. Christian
Scientists were called quacks, but Jesus
was not a auack when he healed the sick
and cured the leper, and those who follow
In his footsteps, said Simpson, deserve
something better than to be treated as
humbugs. Rowell opposed the amend
ment, which he sa'.d struck at the vital
part- of the bill. He said the object of the
measure -was to prevent the practice of
medicine by incompetent persona and 'o
elevate the standard of medicine for the
protection of th'e public.
The final passage of the bill is a fore
gone conclusion. . . .

MEXTO. Feb. 7.â Hourigan of San Fran
cisco has introduced an S-hour bill which
is designed to remedy the defects in the
statute which Judge Hall of Alamei^t
County has just declared unconstitutional.
The bill was framed by the State Bureau
of Labor Statistics, and has the indorse
ment of the State Federation of Labor.
Labor- Commissioner Meyers to-day said
of it:
"The endeavor in this bill is to do in a
clearer and stronger wav what the old
statute tried to do. namely, to require of
an officer of the State who lets a contract
for State work to reaulra that the con
tractor shall not work his men more than
eight hours per day on such contract. The
attempt is made in this bill to put. it in
line with the principle that the United
States courts and the courts of several
Sta.tes have upheld that the State has the
same right as the individual to impose
conditions upon a contractor. And this
bill makes it mandatory <hat the State
officer letting: a contract shall impose the
eipht-hour day as a condition, with a
monetary forfeit in case o/ violation of
such condition. Failure on the part of the
State officer to imbose the condition is
made a misdemeanor."

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 7.-The two little
daughters of Mrs. L. I,. Baker are lyin<
at their mother's home in Ross Valley
severely injured as the result of a run
away accident on the outskirts of this
city late this afternoon. The coachman.
Thomas Bell, who was driving the teani
at the. time, is suffering from a bruised
side.
This afternoon Helen, aged 12, and
Dorothy, aged 10 years, left their 'hom.>
for a drive to this city. The carriage
was driven by Coachman" Thomas Bel'
u hen about to drive into Fourth streo'
from the San Anselmo road the neck voke
broke, dropping the pole to the ground.
Tne horses then became unmanageable
and started to run.
Boll, seeing that ho could
not control tho frightened animals, and
avert a runaway, promptly turned them
pquarely into the high. . enbankment on
the north side of the road. The horses
were thrown and secured by two young
men named Martin and. Morris, who hap
pened *io be passing. The two childror,
and the coachman were thrown from the
carriage. Â§ The little girls were 'insensible
when picked up. They were removed t.>
a neighboring house and medical aid
summoned. Dr. VV. J: Wickman. who ar
rived soon after, found that ho bones
were broken, but that both children were
badly cut and bruised.
It was thought at the time that little
Dorothy had . lost one of her eyes but
later it was found that the eye is un
injured. Both children were- removed to
their home and medical aid summoned
from San Francisco.
According to tHe latest accounts from
their home .both, children are doing well
and no fatal results are expected to fol
low.
Thomas Bell, the conohman. has lonÂ«

no blame is attached to him for the acci

ing in the Montana Legislature. Melick's
amendment is as follows:
"The water of all streams shall forever
remain subject to public control. Bene
ficial use shall be tno basis, the measure
and the limit of all rights to water. The
riprht to water for irritation rests in th>>
user and becomes appurtenant to the land
irrigated. 'Water for iirijration is hereby
declared to be a natural want."
Senator Pace has introduced a bill which
raises the price of the unsold remainder
of the 500.000 acres of school lands, or
lands selected in lieu thereof, from $1 25

The Judiciary Committee had agreed to
report favorably upon such a bill, and as
soon as !t was introduced the committee
sent in a favorable report, and the bill

lic bonds of this State by providing that
neither interest nor principal shall be
paid until the taxes have been paid.
The,re are no provisions in the bill which
provide what shall be proof of the pay
ment of the taxes, the presentation of the
receipt being denied sufficient. The gist
of the bill, which is contained in section 1,
Is as follows:
No officer of any county, city, city and
county, town, township or district in the
State of California shall pay from the
funds thereof any bond or interest coupon
of any bond until all taxes on such bond
or coupon shall have been fnlly paid: and

or coupon shall have been fully paid.
These are the bonds for the exemption
of which from taxation there was an
amendment to the constitution submitted

deemed better to exempt the bonds, as it
was found impassible to collect the taxes
on them. The amendment was defeated

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 7.â T. Carl Spelling, the San
Francisco lawyer, and Assemblyman Mac
beth of San Francisco had a personal en
counter In the corridor outside the Assem
bly chamber this afternoon as a result of
differences over primary election bills.
Spelling called Macbeth a name and dared
the Assemblyman to hit him. Macbeth
slapped Spelling's face, and the lawyer
backed away and kicked at Macbeth. The
latter struck Spelling, and Spelling was
preparing to annihilate the Assemblyman
when AssembTyman Collins stepped be
tween them and stopped the fight.
Spelling has devoted much talk to pri
mary election laws. He drafted elaborate
hills before the beginning of the* session,
and Johnson introduced them for him in
the Assembly. .To-day Johnson withdrew
bills 156. 157, 158. 159. 160 and 161 for the
reason that the provisions' of these bills
are included in Davis' Senate bills.
Spelling has been extremely zealous in
tho advocacy of his Ideas, and has before
to-day become somewhat obstreperous in
assertinjr the virtues of his measures,
especially before the two- Committees, on
Klections. He claims that his bills have
features which, are in no others, while
others assert that he amended his orig
inal bills by, -inserting provisions taken
from the Davis bills. Macbeth is chair
man of the Assembly Elections Commit
tee, and the trouble to-day was caused
by Spelling charging him. after Johnson
withdrew his bills, .with trying to block
effective legislation.

COXSTBUCrnON OF WARSHIPS
DELAYED FOE A YEAR
The Naval Committee of the Senata
Dodges the Question of the In- â¢
crease of the Navy.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â Urgently as
the country needs battleships and arm
ored cruisers, the Senate Naval Commit
tee has postponed the construction of such
vessels for a year, and in lieu thereof has
Riven the navy three submarine boats of
the type which has been so roundly con
demned by naval experts.
The provision regarding the naval .'In
crease placed in the na\-al appropriation
act by the Senate committee, which was
made public to-night, is one of the curiosi
ties of Congressional literature. Appre
ciating that tha country demands contin
uous armorcla.1 construction and fearing
to boldly oppose further increase durine
this session, the committee has artfully
dodged the question.
"That for the purpose of further in
creasing the naval establishment " reads
the provision Incorporated in the* act by
the committee, "the Secretary of the
Navy Is hereby directed to prepare plans
and specifications of two seagoing battle
ships and two armored cruisers carrying
the most suitable armor and armament
for vessels of their class, and -to submit
to Congress, a general description of such
battleships and cruisers on the first Mon
day in December next."

WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â The postofflce
appropriatlon:bill was passed to-day. The
debate hovered about three topics, rail
way mall pay, pneumatic tube service and
special fast mail facilities, but It bore no
fruit.
The. amendment to reduce the rate of
railway mail pay was ruled out on a point
of order, the amendment to continue the
pneumatic tube service in New York.
Boston and Philadelphia was abandoned
for the purpose of making the fight in the
Senate and the motions to strike out ap
propriations for special mail facilities
were defeated.
The chair ruled the Joy amendment, to
appropriate $265,000 for pneumatic tubÂ«
service, out of order on the ground that
the current law contained a provision
aÂ°-ain<5t the extension of the service be
yond New York, Philadelphia and Boston.
Scudden of New York withdrew his
amendment to appropriate 5__>.000 for the
continuation of the service ln New York.
Boston and Philadelphia. Mann then in
sisted upon his point of order against the
amendment of .H. C. Smith of Michigan
to reduce railway mall pay and the point
of order was sustained.
The opponents of the appropriations for
special facilities carried the tight into the
HouÂ»e Â¦' where there could be a record
vote but were beaten by votes of 60 to 23
and 33 to 79 and the bill was passed.
The Speaker laid before the House
certified copies of the electoral vote in the
several States, excepting those of Colo
rado and Tennessee. The vote will be
counted at a Joint sejslon of the House
and Senate February 13. The Speaker
appointed Grosvenor of Ohio and Richard

half of the House on that occasion.
The Senate bill to allow travel pay to

In the Philippines upon their discharge
from the volunteer service was passed.
The Militarv Academy .bill and the bill

NEW YORK, Feb. 7.â Wu Tin? Fang,
Chinese Minister to the United States, to
night refused to sit at the. same table
with Major General Elwell S. Otis of the
United States army. The Chinese Minis
ter took pains to explain that while he
felt only respect for General Otis as a
military commander and esteem for him
personally, his course In declining to
share the honors of the feast with thÂ«
general was due to General Otis' attitude
while governor general of the Philippines
In enforcing there the objectionable fea
tures of the Chinese exclusion act. This,
the Chinese Minister said, he could not
possibly approve and he would not put
himself ln a position of seeming to in
dorse it.
Wu Ting Fang said ln his letter of dec
lination to. the Society of the Genesee: "I
think while military governor General
Otis committed an egregious error and
did great injustice to the Chinese by Intro
ducing the Chinese exclusion act into the
Philippines, which has stirred up race
prejudice and done harm to those Islands
While I believe General Otis acted upon
the ill advice of some one, still If I werÂ»
to attend 1 the dinner, in his honor I could
not decline the invitation to say some
thing concerning tho general. And what
I might have to say might not be pleasant
for the general or his fellow banqueters
to hear." Â¦'

SHADOWS PLAY QUEER
FRUAXS AT WHITE HOUSE
Cast Profiles of President McKinley
and the I,ate Queen

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-Several times
In the last three years there have been
published descriptions of various singular
shadows that have appeared from time to
time on the north or main porch of the
"White House. One of these shadows rep
resented the profile and bent form of an
old woman, with one hand resting on an
indistinct object that resembled a spin
ning wheel. This shadow cast by the
su J l .' s _ r . ays shInln * through the railing
which is a part of the colonial structure
at the top of the mansion, appeared daily
at a certain hour for two or three weeks
and as It was about that time President
McKinley's mother died the phenomenon
made a deep impression on many suDer
stltious persons. . v
Th t l^\ e *l\ manifestation of freaklshnesa
5 n the \\hite House portico appeared to
da y-, JJ he . s , un . was snl mne. brightly, and
at 12:oO o'clock the shadow of a nonde
script form appeared^ on the great pillar
at the extreme northwest corner of the
portico. It soon took on definite shape
and at 1 o clock represented the face and
shoulders of President McKinley in pro
file. The silhouette was so striking In its
accuracy that many persons who saw it
remarked that a more correct profile
drawing of Mr. McKinley could not b<Â»
made-by any artist. The likeness was not
a correct one for more than two minutes
It gradually changed with the altering
position of the sun. and at 1:10 o'clock had
assumed a remarkably perfect likeness to
the face of the late Queen Victoria even
to an object on the head resemblW a
crown. 6 ~
This likeness lasted for two or three
minutes, then gradually disappeared Two
hours later the same succession of shad
ow portraits appeared on the northeast
pillar at the outside of the portico fortv
feet away. " * /

In force in the Indian Territory the laws

The pension appropriation bill, was then
passed, sifter Gallinper had stated that
ls>y) names had been placed on the pension
rolls thus far on account of the Spanish
war, at an annual ccst cf about $270,000.
McLaurin of South Carolina then opened
the debate on the subsidy bill, advocating
its passage. He said it would benefit the
cotton growing Interest of the Southern
Sratea and contended also that legislation
that would stimulate American shipping
would benefit not "only the cotton Interest.
but sll other agricultural interests.
Morgan of Alabama took the floor to
oppose the pending- bill. He declared the
bill would result in a commercial conflict
between the United States and Great Brit
ain, in which the financial batteries of the
two countries would be arrayed against
each other. He was inclined tc think that
the United States 'would be worsted ln
such a ccnfilct. because of the immensely
superior sea power of Great Britain. Mor
gan then made an earnest plea for the
adoption of the Clay Nicaragua canal
amendment to the subsidy bill. At 5:30 p.

BRYAN OPPOSES
THE SILVER-BILL
Replies to Communication of
â¢House Committee on
Coinage.
.Says Proposed Redemption, of Silver
Dollars for Gold Would Causa
Heavy I>rair_ on Treas
ury Reserve.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â Chairman
Southard of the House Committee on
Coinage to-day received from William J.
Bryan the latter's view of the pending
bills before the "House making the stand
ard silver dollar redeemable ln sold.
After thanking the committee for the
courtesy of inviting his views Mr. Bryan
says in part:
The bill has a double purpose â first, to con
vert standard silver dollars Into, subsidiary
coin, and second, to make silver dollars re
deemable ln gold on demand. In discussing
the subject, however. It will be more logical
to consider th* latter proposition first; re
demption Is only a step toward retirement.
There Is no necessity for redemption. The
legal tender law will maintain the parity be
tween gold coin and silver dollars so long as
both can bo used to an unlimited extent ln the
payment of public revenues and private debts.
I should perhaps say that the parity will be
substantially maintained, for local and tem
porary conditions may under any law put a
small premium upon any kind of money.
Mr. Bryan cites the premium on silver
in New York in 1833, caused by the local
demand for small* change. He also cites
Senator Sherman in support of his state
ment. Proceeding Mr. Bryan says: \ .
Ab soon as the silver dollar Is made redeem
able ln gold, another endless chain will be
created and the arguments used against the
greenbacks and treasury notes will then be
turned against silver. Before the attempt to
burden the gold reserve with this new obliga
tion Is consummated, it may be worth while,
to consider the opinion expressed by Secretary
Mr. Carlisle thought It a mistake to com
mence paying ln gold, but considered It dan
gerous to Interfere with the custom after It
was once established. By the same logic It
can be argued that we should not establish
â¢:ha custom cf redeeming the silver dollars ln
gold.
Mr. Bryan concludes as follows:
ThÂ« measure recommended by the committee
given to the financiers absolute control over the
national debt. They can Increase It any time
by presenting silver dollars for redemption
and compelling an Issue of bonds to replenish
the gold reserve. They can ln the same' way
contract the volume of money In circulation
since money drawn into the Treasury by an
Issue of bonds cannot go out again unless It
Is used to meet current expenses (and that Is
only possible when the expenditures exceed the
receipts), or loaned out to Government banks.
Second. thÂ« conversion of standard silver
dollars into subsidiary coin ia equivalent to

THE ROOT OF THE MATTER.
He Cared Hi__sÂ«l_ cf Serious Stomach
Trouble Dow_ to First Principles.
A man cf large ailalrs la caa cf our
j-Tcrniseiit Eastern cities by too dose at-
uen_â â to business, too little exercise and
tno i__rr club dinners, finally began to
-&y nature's tax, levied in the form ot
ri-.ror.ic etci_ach trouble: the failure of
his "digestion brought about a nervous ir-
rttaMHTy. rna._lngr it Impossible to apply
iumseif to his dally business and finally
r.crangir.g the kidneys and heart.
In hi* oxm words he says: "I consulted
rr:e f">'slcian ;ifter aj-.otner ar.d each one
5Â»fn;ed to -ndersisnd my case, but all the
fime thfy each faiie<1 to brir.Â£ about the
return of my forrr.er digestion, appetite
and vig-or. For two year? I went from
j-.Illar to post, from or.e sanitarium to an-
other. I gave up evoking, I <ju!l coJTee
and even renounced my daily gla^s or two
of beer, but without any marked improve-
ment.
"Friends had often advised me to trv a
â¢well known proprietary medicine. Stuaft's
!>\ spepsia Tablets, and I had often j
rerused the newpaper advertisements of j
the remedy, but never took any stock in
advertised inecieir.es nor could believe a I
Â£'"<-cent patent __e_ld_M -would touch my
case.
"To raake a 'cr.c 6tcry 6hort. I finally
Imught a co-pla cf packages at the near-
est drug- stcre ajid took two or three
tablets _T:er eac:i meal end occasionally a
tablet be:-.een meals, when I felt any
feelirjr ci nausea or discomfort.
"I was Burprt-e- at the end of the first
â¢week to note a marked improvement in
my Ejrr<?tite ar.d general health and be-
frre ;he tv,o packages were gone I -was I
certain thai Stuart # s Dyspepsia Tablets i
-â¢ere gcir.g: to cure completely and thrv j
dl_ not disappoint me. I can eat and i
e:eep ar.d enjoy my coffee and cigar and :
r.o ore would suppose I had ever known '
the hcrrcrs cf -yspepsia.
"Ottt cf friendly curiosity I wrote to the !
rroprfetcrs of the remedy asking for in-
formation as to what the tablets con- I
Tained and they replied that the principal |
ir.^recller.ts were aseptic pepsin (Govern- â¢
ment test), malt d!astasÂ« and other i
natural digestive-, -w_:ch digest food r*- t
pardless cf the condition of the stomach." i
The root of the matter is thi* the d!?f s- J
tive elements contained ln Stuart's Dvs- ;
prpsia Tablets will digest the food, give '
the overworked stomach a chance to re- '
cuperate and the r.erves and whole svstem J
receive the nourishment which can only I
come from food; etimulafits and nerve j
tor.lcs never sive real strength, th^y give
a fictitious strength, invariably followed j
by reaction. Every drop of blood, every j
Mm and tissue is manufactured from j
cur dally food, and If you can insure its
prompt action ar.d complete digestion by I
the regruiar use cf so pood and wholesome ]
a remedy as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. !
yc-j will have r.o r.eed ci nerve tonics or !

WfJR TfJX REDUCTIONS.
rROM the manner in which the Senate ha3
treated the House bill providing for a reduction
of taxes under the war revenue act it looks as
if there might be a disagreement between the two
houses which will lead to a deadlock so far as this
session is concerned. Well informed experts at Wash
ington report it is doubtful whether a House revenue
bill was ever before so disfigured in the Senate. It
appears that what is virtually a new bill has been pre
pared by the Senate and that when it goes to the
House the framers. will find nothing of their original
bill except the title.
It will be a difficult point for the leaders of th;
House to determine whether or no the Senate amend
ments should be accepted so as to enable a prompt
passage of the act at this session. It is well known the
people desire a reduction of the war taxes, that the
Government does not need all the revenue derived from
it, and furthermore that it would be expedient to make
the reduction at this session. On the other hand there
are good reasons for objecting to it. The Senate bill
may be in some respects better than that of the House,
but in many it is certainly worse. The efforts made
to provide that telegraph and express companies shall
be compelled to bear the burden of the tax upon mes
sages and packages were defeated. Thus one of the
most important points which the public demanded in
the way of revision has been denied, and the measu -e,
if adopted as it .leaves the Senate, will be the subject
of even more dissatisfaction than was shown toward'
the original act.
iN'is by no means desirable that there should be a
deadlock on a matter of this kind. The session is
rapidly approaching its close, and perhaps it might
be as well to arrange a compromise and pass the re
duction bill at once, but even if that be done there will
be little credit gained by the performance. The war
revenue bill was drawn and passed in a hurry to me :t
the emergency of war. Consequently no one was
surprised when grave defects were found in it, and
no condemnation was pronounced upon the Congre/s
that enacted it. At this time, however, a different
situation prevails. Congress has had ample time to
note the operation of the act and observe its defects.
There can be no excuse, therefore, for the action of
the Senate in refusing to so amend the measure as
BRYAN flND VfJN WYCK.
THE Mayor of New York refused to half-mast
the city flag on the death of Victoria.
No one cared much whether the flag of King
Croker was unfurled on that occasion by his vassal
and the keeper of his great seal. As the incident was
not attracting' as much attention as' the Mayor- wished
he began to give reasons for it in order to keep it be
fore the public. After submitting several he finally
said that he refused to half-mast the flag for the
Queen because he did not do it oh the death of the
Boer general, Joubert. The reason was of the sort
of logic which appeals to Colonel Bryan, and he re
sponded'in his weekly paper and put himself on the
wires again to this effect: "Mayor Van Wyck pre
sented a complete defense when he cited the failure
to pay this tribute to Joubert as a precedent. If a
flag on a public building is not made to pay tribute
to the memory of v a hero who died in freedom's holy
cause, then it is not extremely important that the flag
be required to pay tribute to kings and queens. There
are some people in this country who are more anxious
to pay tribute to monarchs than to recognize the
merits of free men."
There are also some people in this country who see
right through a turgid demagogue. Van Wyck, the
Mayor of New York, controls the flag of the city. He
is the man behind the halliards. He is the' one who
did not pay tribute to the memory of a hero who died
in freedom's holy cause! He could have flagged .the
departed hero if he wanted to, but he didn't. Indeed
it is probable that, he failed to think of the hero and
that he and King Croker were too much absorbed
in Tammany's holy cause to give any attention to
Dame Freedom her hero, i He had in view no
principle at all in the failure to honor Joubert, and
toquote that failure as, a precedent for not honoring
the Queen, who owned much real estate despoiled of
taxes by Tammany in New York and whose flag shel
ters King' broker's English residence,"shooting es
tate, racing stable and ten thousand dollar bull pup,- is
all an afterthought of the most-belated and post
mortem kind. Â»
Bryan doesn't sec how very funny he seems to all
sensible people. One week he eulogizes the dead Queen,
as floridly as if he had been born within sound of the
Bow bells, and the next he rolls his eyes and bites
hia thumb at : monarchs and potentates and indorses
Van Wyck for saying that lie will not honor the
Queen because he did, not honor Joubert! ~

WITH no little gratification the people of San
Francisco have watched the earnest efforts of
the Assembly Investigating Committee to get
the truth and the whole truth concerning the charges
of corrupt bargain between the police authorities and
the gamblers of Chinatown. What has been done by
the committee thus far gives promise of yielding good
results to the community. The investigation has beer,
conducted on a broad scale, and the public is confi
dent it will continue so to the end.
, Such being the case the people have a right to ex
pect that among: the witnesses examined will be cx-
Po!ice Commissioner Biggy. Since ex-Commissioner
McNutt has given testimony there is no reason why
Mr. Bijrgy should not be called. In fact, the testi
mony of Mr. Bigg}- is likely to be much more val
uable than that of his former colleague, for during his
service on the commission Mr. Biggy acted as Chief
cf Police and in that capacity entered actively upon
the task of suppressing gambling and other violations
By reason of his experience while acting as Chief
of Police Mr. Biggy undoubtedly learned much of th=
nature and extent of the violations of law in China
town, and his testimony on that subject will undoubt
edly throw light on all problems in relation to its
suppression. It is well known that when he was at
the head of the Police Department there was no com

nerve and skill as a waterman. One
stormy night in winter "William Gibbons,
president of the ! New York and New
Brunswick Company, was at Perth Am
boy and desired most earnestly to get
across the Sound to Tottenville. None of
the boatmen would consider an offer to
row him across until Vanderbilt offered to
do so. The trip was dangerous, but the
men landed on the Staten Island shore in
safety. Gibbons was appreciative of the
good qualities yanderbilt had displayed
and made him captain and part owner of
a small oyster sloop. A successful sea
son put him in control of a little capital,
and Gibbons, who always remained his
firm friend, advised him to take the man
agement of the Bellonia Hotel, which then
needed some one to take charge. Vander
bilt did so and began to make money at
once. His wife would attend to the hotel
,and Vanderbilt served aÂ» captain on one
of the freight boats of the company, this
position, too, coming to him through Gib

PAPERS BY 'EXPERTS.
YESTERDAY The Call announced that upon the
termination of the - series â¢ of Home Circle
Studies there would begin a new series of papers
to be known as "The Current Topics Club." At that
time information was given of the general subjects
which would be taken up on the different days of the
week and the name of the editor who would have
charge of each subject. We now direct attention to
the details of- some of the series in order that our
readers may have a fuller understanding of the treat
prepared for theip.
The papers that are to appear on Monday, for ex
ample, are to deal with "The Opportunity and the
Man," and, as was announced yesterday, President
Draper of the University of Illinois will act as editor
and Senator Hoar wiil contribute the concluding ar
ticle. In the- course of that series there are to be
papers' by William B. Rankin, the electrical engineer
who "harnessed Niagara Falls"; Timothy Kinney of
Wyoming, who is said to own more sheep than any
one else on earth; W. W. Duson, the "rice king" of
Louisiana; ' Hugh Chisholm, the well-known pa
per manufacturer of Maine; R. S. Brookings, the
millionaire merchant of St. Louis; the famous en
gineer, Corthell; .the great watch manufacturer,
Dueber; Cramp, the well-known'ship-builder; Ed
win Reynolds, one of the greatest machinery experts
in the country, and other such successful business men
as Barber, the manufacturer of matches, Wilcox, the
prominent miller of Oregon, and F. A. Heinze,~th2
so-called "copper king" of Montana.
It will be perceived that papers by such men will
have a practical value. Those men have learned in the
world of work how to recognize an opportunity when
they see it and also how to profit by it. They repre
sent nearly all lines of business and all sections of the
United States. What they have to tell has been de
rived from the lessons of actual experience. They
know whereof they speak, and their advictf and guid
ance will be of high value to every young man and
young woman in the country who is confronted with
the necessity of earning a living and who has an am
bition to achieve a career of usefulness in the domain
of industry.
Next consider the widely different series which is to
appear on Tuesdays. That series is to give an account
of "Colonial Governments of To-day," and is to be
in charge of Professor Finley of Princeton. The peo
ple who have had the greatest amount of experience
in governing all sorts of colonies in our time are the
British, and consequently it is among them that some
of the principal writers on the subject have been
sought. Among the papers are to be: "Mauritius,"
by Edgcumbe Staley of London, author of "The Arni3
and Badges of British Colonies"; "Zanzibar," by
Walter Hodgson of Keble College, Oxford; "The
Empire of India," by Edgcumbe Staley; "Why
Great Britain Succeeds as a Colonizer," by Alfred
Stead of London, Fellow of the Royal Colonial In
stitute. In addition there are to be papers on other
important British colonies, as well as colonies of the
Dutch, French, Germans and Portuguese.
It will be seen from the names given that the papers
of this series, like those of the Monday series, are to
be contributed by experts and will be full of instruc
tion for all students.* The papers of the series. to be
published on each of the other days of the week will
be equally authoritative and interesting. We shall re
fer to them more in detail later on, but for the pres
ent the series referred to will serve as illustrations of
the care taken to make the Current Topics Club well
worthy the attention of all classes of readers, from
those who wish nothing more than an interesting ar
ticle to those who desire to make a sincere study of
the salient features of events of our time.
The series is to begin Monday, February 18, and
will continue for four months. It will be well for all
readers to begin the series with the first number, and
they should therefore look o'it for it.

Danger to Niagara Falls.
Danger to Niagara Falls from the rapid
diversion of water for Industrial purpose
Is being pointed out by the Commission
ers of tbe Niagara Falls reservation.
They claim that in the interest of pre
serving the lake levelsâ threatened by
numerous canal projects, and In that of
the scenic beauty of the falls, the State
should enforce Its right to charge corpora
tions or individuals for tne use of this
water; or to prevent Its further diversion
by legislative enactment. The amendment
suggested to existing law on this. head is
vigorously opposedâ as might be imag

Premium on Footpads.
Several years ago, when St. Louis was
overrun with highwaymen, the quiet tip
went out to the police force that the pa
trolman who brought in a live footpad
would have a cinch on his job and he who
brought in a dead one would be made a
sergeant. This had a very salutary effect,
as several corpses were soon turned in.
The investigation in each case only ex
tended to the necessary proof that tho
dead man had been engaged in the sand
bagging business as a means of livelihood.
No embarrassing questions were asked
the officer who brought In the body, and,
in every case he was duly promoted. â

Free Choice to Marry.
A five dollar tax upon bachelorhood i3
hardly high enough to drive a man into
marriage to escape the expense of remain-
Ing single, so the women of Michigan need
not take alarm at the proposition now be*
fore the Legislature of that State to Im
pose such a tax upon all men of 30 and
over who are unmarried. But the women
would be the first to recognize the danger
of any legislation that forced a man Into
marriage, if such a thing were possible.
A free choice to marry or* a free choice
to remain* single must be the rule with
men and women If happiness Is to bÂ«
given a chance. â New Bedford Standard.
Sweden Arms Against Russia.
The Swedish Government Is undoubtedly
about to undertake an elaborate reorgan
ization of the array and provide for Its in
crease. The erection of .fortifications in
the northern part of the Scandinavian
peninsula Indicates whence the scare
come*. The Swedes and Norwegians fear
Russia all the more since Finland's auto
nomy was destroyed and the Czar's fron
tier was advanced squarely up to the
boundary of Sweden. From the Russian
viewpoint the absorption of Scandinavia
Â¦would be a priceless addition, sincp it
would give to Russia the whole Nor
wegian littoral, and it la littoral that tfca
Czar needs most In Europe. The Swed.-3
and Norwegians, however, can be trust
ed to hold on for at least another century,
now that the modern rlfie gives such ex
traordinary advantage to the defense in
war. They could put 500,000 men In the

Carnegie's Benefactions.
The total of Andrew Carnegie's gifts to
educational institutions and libraries, as
well as In miscellaneous directions,
amounts to 513.540,&65, and he has a mil
lion dollars more of library applications
under consideration. Standing? by Itself
this is a magnificent showing and It ar

have even come near It. The conditions
which Mr. Carnegie has imposed upon
himself, while they do not In any way
disparage his philanthropy, nevertheless
give it a kind of hopeless aspect so far
as his own future is concerned. Mr. Car
negie recently said in the most publJo
manner that "to die rich Is to die dis
graced." and his contributions therefore
must be looked upon as an effort on his
part to save his good name from discredit
at the last and himself from humiliation.

exaggerated. Most fortunes usually are.

Submarine Torpedo Boats.
The official tests of the submarine tor
pedo boats made at Cherbourg appear to
indicate that the French Government will
shortly have boats of this typo that will
add greatly to the efficiency of Its navy.
The performance of the Morse, which is
run by a petroleum motor, seems to have
been quite as satisfactory in every way
as those of the Holland In American
waters. When submerged, a process which
la speedily - accomplished, no part of the
vessel is visible except the "periscope." or
seeing station, which can be turned to
every point ot the horizon, and itself can
be seen only by a powerful glass. It steers
accurately and quickly and can remain
submerged over eight hours Â¦without the
slightest Inconvenience to officers or crew,
owiqs to the perfect working of the air
pumps. It discharges torpedoes by means
of compressed air with astonishing force
and with such accuracy that of four fired
within a period of twenty minutes all
touched a given mark. The French hava
been more alert in the construction of tor
pedo boats than any other nation. By the
figures set forth in Secretary Root's last
report France laid down in 1000, In ton

The High Court of Nations.
That the nations which participated In
the Peace Conference at The Ilag-ue la
18S9 appreciate the tremendous obligation,
which they there assumed Is impressively
demonstrated by the roster of thÂ©^Â»erma

the final agreement of that body. This
tribunal is now organized and ready for
business. It is at once the largest and
highest court ever known to Christen

gates, those still .unrepresented consisting
of the minor countries of Persia, Slam

a remarkable massing of the forces of

been guided soleiy by a desire to add dig
nity and strength to the tribunal as a

tated the appointment of Chief Justice

for the United States is reflected in tho

KANSAS is suffering an attack of the holy terror,
in the person of Mrs. Nation. Her violently
picturesque proceedings, her appeals to her
"dear, hell-bound brethren," as she calls the saloon
keepers, the mobs of women who follow her lead and
the mobs of women who oppose her, all have held the
center of the stage since she spilled the first pint of
swipes in Wichita two weeks ago. â¢
In some of its phases her crusade is getting serious.
Looking for a cause it is foundljn the local history of
Kansas. Several years ago that State suffered a pass
ing spasm of prohibition reform. Governor St. John
led the movement and worked up a highly hysterical
condition of the public mind, and while that condition
was at its height a prohibition amendment to the con
stitution was adopted. It was a rum tight affair, that
amendment. It put light wines ,and beers, the bever
ages that are least harmful because they are used as
part of the diet, in the same list with those hot, re
bellious liquors which enter a man's mouth only to
steal away his brains. Cider more than a day old was
put down as the twin brother of cognac of the vintage
of 1840, and currant wine and old crow were put in
the stocks together as equally guilty of the fall of
man.
After all this was done in the midst of extreme ex
citement and agitation the men of Kansas began to
cool off. Reaction is sure to follow such extremes.
After .St. John was lost sight of in a social scandal,
in which he vainly made Adam's plea, Kansas got so
cool about prohibition that it was discovered that the
sober public opinion of the State was not behind the
prohibition amendment. It had been adopted by a
great majority, but that majority did not stay red hot,
as it was the day it voted. So there came to Kansas
the same transformation that came to. England when
Charles II became King and human nature reacted
against Puritan austerity and sourness, and the May
poles went up and women put flowers in their hats
again and children danced. '
Kansas did not become beastly drunk in the reaction,
but she refused to stay any longer beastly sober. Wise
men in the State have seen for fifteen years that the
proper thing to do would be to resubmit the prohibi
tion amendment to the people, that they might pass
upon it in coolness and soundness of judgment, in the
hope that the liquor traffic, sustained by public
opinion, but existing as an unrestrained outlaw, might
be brought under proper restriction and control. But
no Kansas politician could be found wise enough to
propose such a sensible solution. Then the State went
into a fresh spasm of Populism, and produced Jerry
Simpson, Mrs. Lease and a United States Senator
with whiskers a yard long and a head the size of a
bellflower apple.
So bleeding Kansas went on with liquor-selling pro
hibited in her constitution but practiced in her towns
as openly as the sale of milk.
Into the middle of this situation jumped Mrs. Na
tion with her prayers and her hatchet, like a lighted
match into a powder-house, and the crash of glass and
swash of spilled drinks have since been interrupted
only by the mixture of prayers and blasphemy that has
ascended with the odors of the mixed liquors she
leaves on the floor. Such a situation was never be
fore seen in a civilized country. In their day of fury
the people of Kansas constitutionally outlawed liquor
and the buildings in which it is sold, so Mrs. Nation
chops down the locked doors of saloons before day
light in the morning and lets in the crowd, which may
make free with everything, from the whisky behind
the bar to the money in the cash register.
To break into a building where there are persons
asleep or awake is the crime of burglary, but this pure
water sprite pays no attention to that..
This week she paused long enough to rest her
hatchet and take her pen in hand to write an address
to the schoolchildren of the United States to throw
stones through the windows of saloons and liquor
stores as they pass by on their way to school. This
extension of her methods threatens serious results. All
States do not keep -as wide a gulf between preaching
and practice as Kansas has. In most of them the
rights of property in liquor and in the buildings
where it is sold are protected by law, and Mrs. Na
tion's advice to the children in such States is incen
diary.
Why does it not occur to Mrs. Nation and her fol
lowers to go calmly at work to create in Kansas a
public opinion influential upon a majority of the peo
ple that will sustain the St. John amendment and all
its works? Then there would be no saloons to smash.
It is for the lack of such a public opinion that pro
hibition has everywhere failed. Spasmodic and emo
tional reformers get it adopted and soon it dies,
neither the letter nor the spirit of the law living longer
than the passing passion in which it was enacted.

THE Vanderbilt family, says the New
York World, owes much to the old
Bellonia Hotel, on Burnet street, in
New Brunswick, N. J. The old
hotel has long been one of the most
Interesting landmarks hi New Brunswick.
At present it is a tenement house, and In
every way shows the marks of time.
When It was managed by Cornelius Van
derbilt, afterward known as "Commo
dore" "Vanderbilt, It was one of the most
Important hotels and one of the best-pay
ing properties In the State. The New
York and New Brunswick Freight Com
pany conducted a line of freight and pas
senger sloops between the two cities, and
New Brunswick was the terminus of the
stage coach route from Philadelphia. At
the Bellonia passengers stopped and wait
ed for the boat to New York or the coach
to Philadelphia, as the case might be.
Vanderbilt frequently said that it was his
observation of the unsatisfactory meth
ods of transportation that turned his en
erpies to railroad building.
The Bellonla Hotel was built In 1803, and
alter some years passed into control of
the transportation company. An Interest-

the way in which Vanderbilt pot his first
start. For years he had made a preca-

THE BARKENTINE CITY OF PAPEETE THAT WENT ASHORE ON .
CORAL, REEF AT TAHITI MAKING PORT. SHE COMES HERE FO
AN OVERHAULING.
when human beings first. stood upon th9
virgin soil that wa3 waiting to receive
them. In each locality the newcomers
must have commenced under similar con
ditions. Their progress in the social
scale must have been gradual, slow and
almost unconscious to themselves. The
rude search to eke out a merely animal
existence had hitherto taxed all tho forcei
of body and mind. Nothing had before
been possible except to exist wretchedly.
Now from the river they were assured
unfailing supply of water and fish. Spon
taneously or in return for little labor th9
fertile earth yielded an abundance of fruit
and" grain. Settled on a fixed habitation
men's ideas were no longer limited to
satisfaction of immediate wants. Wealth
began to accumulate. With its Increase
the necessity was revealed of some degree
of government with a measure of protec
tion and order. The weak huddled for
safety around the stronger. Whatever
conception of right existed was submitted
to the verdict of might. Despotic author
ity grew parallel with the growth of pop
ulation. Hence, as primitive Chaldea. In
dia and China unfold before our gaze. wÂ«s
behold everywhere despotism. This waa
Inevitable. Only an advanced degree of
Intelligence and civilization can conceive
of republics and governments by the peo
ple. Asia presents even to the present day
no example of either.
Though adjacent to each other, China
and India were kept apart by the impene
trable barriers of the Himalayas. War
was no more Impossible between them
than was Influence. Each In Its own way
attained the fullest development of the
East. Despotism unmitigated presided
over both. But north cf the Himalayas
this despotism was united with the au
thority of the scholar, while south of the
Himalayas it waa united with the author
ity of the priest. So is it still. The an
nals of- each are permeated by this fact.
The ancient books of India tell us only
of their religion and their gods. The tra
ditions of China are filled with the suffer
ings that country endured at the hands of
Western Asiatic hordes.
Reports of wealth accumulated In the
Chinese and Indian valleys reached the
ears of the barbarians of the steppes. Af
fluence had not produced capability of
military resistance. On the northwest
China was less defended by nature from
attack. The gr^af wall, built in the third
century before Christ, was a confession to
the rapacious nomads of the weakness
which it was designed to protect.
Let us now pass to the other primitive
region, tho klr.Bdom of Chaldea. It lay
aiong the lower Euphrates at the head of
the Persian Gulf. Its priests ascribe it
an antiquity of 400,000 years. It probably
never extended to occupy all the area, In
cluded between the natural limits of the
nearest mountain ranges. Its boundaries
are indefinite. Later comers erected Ba
bylon on " the Euphrates and Assyrian
Nir.eveh on the Ticris. Such triple do
minion was certain not .to continue for
ever where boundaries were so hard to
fix. After many vlclssitures of war an<l
conquest Nineveh was utterly destroyed.
An empire became supreme, with Babylon
as its capital.
Descriptions of Babylonian splendor and
wealth and .luxury bewilder imagination.
That city commanded all the wide stretch
between the Caspian and Arabian seas.
All the routes of. commerce passed
through her streets. She was the unri
valed metropolis of Asia and of the world.
The Elboorz range was the home of the
Medes ar.d the wild plateau west of the
Tigris ar.d the Persian Gulf of the Per
sians. These hardy mountaineers united.
The plain coulrt not withstand the on
slaught from the mountains. The new
kingdom of the kindred Medes and Per
sians took the place of Babylonian su
premacy. Their empire reached at last
from the Indian Ocean to the Danube,
from the Mediterranean to the Indus. It
was the first Asiatic power to send its
armies to the shores of Europe. Thus
the armed contact between the two con
tinents may be traced back through suc
cessive stages to the Chaldean kingdom
on the Persian Gulf. But since the Per
sian Darius crossed the Bosporus in the
sixth century before Christ that armed
contact has never ceased. Only the com
batants have changed places. It Is Eu
ropo which envelops Asia to-day.

rive Other Members of Grew Are Injured by the Explosion,
Which' Renders Port Engine Useless and Prevents
Steamship Making Record Run.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura arrived from Philadel
phia yesterday morning. Owing
to an unfortunate accident she
was fourteen hours behind the So
noma's record. A steam pipe .burst and
the result was five deaths and Injuries to
five people.
The Ventura had made a wonderfully
good run from Philadelphia when Valpa
raiso was sighted, and all hands expect
ed to come into San Francisco Bay with
a broom at the foremast head. Instead
the big liner came in with her flags at
half mast. Up to the time Valparaiso was
reached all went well. After that Chief
Engineer Ilaynes began to keep a watch
on the machinery. On January 23, when
in latitude 30 degrees 58 minutes south,
longitude S7 degrees 42 minutes west, or
about 750 miles from Valparaiso, the ex
plosion came. It was 6:15 p. m. and the
watch had just been changed. The men
were beginning their duties when the
main steam pipe went with a report. that
made all aboard think one of the boilers
had burst. George W. Robb, a Junior
engineer; J. AW Faren, a seaman; Jack
Desmond, a fireman; Paul Beier, a coal
passer, and Felix Glass, a stowaway, who
was acting as a coal passer, were killed
almost in an instant, while Patrick Mc-
Connell, a fireman; J. Kelly, fireman; A.
Peterson, fireman; J. Gaughan, coal
passer and C. Ralk, coal passer, were bad
ly burned by the escaping Bteam. All of
the latter men are back at work and are
none the worse for their injuries. The
live men who lost their lives were burled
at sea the next day.
The damage to the mail boat was not
as great as might be expected. The port
engine was disabled, but under the star
board machinery the big liner was able to
average 340 knots a day, bringing her into
port almost on schedule time. Had the
accident not occurred the Ventura would
have been here several days ago and
broken all previous records. As it is the
Sonoma holds the flag.
CITY OF PAPEETE ARBIVES.
Goes Ashore on Coal Beef but Is
Hauled Off.
The erstwhile mail boat City of Papeete
got back to San Francisco yesterday. She
must receive a thorough overhauling be
fore she can go to sea again, and even af
ter the repairs are made she may not go
to sea on her old run again Tho advent of
the mall steamship Australia has taken
nearly all the trade away from the wind
jammers, so the Papeete may be'with
drawn from that run.
The City of Papeete went ashore on the
reef at the entrance to Papeete on July
7 last. She was leaving port when the
wind fell light and she drifted down on
the coral barrier that encircles the har
bor. After considerable trouble she was
got on! and patched up, and then sent
to San Francisco for complete repairs.
Water Front Notes.
A Chinese named Ah Lun waa run down
by a yellow Mission-street car at the cor
ner of East and Jackson streets yester
day and had a narrow escape from death.
He was crossing- from Jackson-street
wharf when the car struck him. Two of
his ribs were fractured and his knee
sprained. He was treated at the Harbor
liospital by Dr. Morrison.
Pontoons are to be used on the sub
merged steamer South Portland and It Is
expected that she will be raised to-mor
row. Work has been going on ever since
the vessel was sunk and the tug Relief
lias now jrot her in such a position that
with the aid of pontoons and cofferdams
she can be raised and once more uut into
commission. *
Captain Payne takes command of the
steamship Crescent City to-day. Cap
tain Stockfleth, who has been on the run
for a generation, retires. A more popu
lar master never Balled a vessel than
Captain Stockfleth. and his retirement on
a. well-earned rest is not viewed with
much satisfaction by the traveling 1 public,
although his family and friends hail It
with delleht.
Henry Kistenmacher, a saloon keeper
on the front, was robbed Of $40 "Wednes
day night. While ejecting a drunk he was
beaten over the head find had to go to the
Harbor Hospital for repairs. While away
a chance acquaintance took care of the
saloon, but when Kistenmacher got back
he found the saloon running itself and
the cash drawer empty. The Harbor Po
lice are now looking for Kistenmacher's

STEAM PIPE BURSTS
AND BRINGS DEATH TO FIVE MEN
The War Geography of Asia.
Suppose a line be drawn eastward from
Cape Baba on the Aegean Sea to Canton.
Suppose another line be drawn southward
from the frozen shores of the Kara Sea .to
the southern tip of India. These two lines
at nearly right angles to each other will
traverse Asia In Its length and breadth.
Near the intersection they cross a region
of distinctive physical character, called
the Pamirs. This region lies south of the
fortieth parallel. It is about 220 miles In
length from, east to west and slightly
broader from north to south. It includes
an area of over 50,000 square miles. The
whole extent form3 a plateau. Its surface
nowhere less than ll.OOu feet In height, and
serves as the pedestal, or base, for a. be
wildering mass of mountains, whose sum
mits rise more than 25,000 feet above the
level of the sea. Here Is the rocky, al
most inaccessible heart of Asia. Here is
afforded the fittest point, the focal center,
from which to trace the always involved,
often disconnected, Asiatic system. The
Oriental calls this region "the roof of the
world." What Olympus was to the
Greek, that the Pamirs are to the Asiatic.
Only Olympus was in comparison a lone
ly mountain, whose cloud-wrapped sum
mit did not attain the altitude of the base
on which tho Pamir Mountains rest.
Furthermore, Olympus was but one
grand but aloneâ while the Pamirs are an
overwhelming host Of the mightiest piles
on earth.
From this focal center chains extend
toward the four points of tho compass,
though those toward the east and west
are predominant. The main eastern chain
speedily separates into two enormous
arms. The lower arm is the Himalayas.
It continues in a colossal curve a thou
sand four hundred miles in length.
Some of its peaks, glittering with eternal
snow, tower farther into the heavens than
any other summits on the globe. Gaorln
saker or Everest, with an altitude of 29,
005 feet, is the monarch of mountains,
about twice as high as Mount Blanc, the
king of Europe, about rive times as high
as Mount Washington, the glory of New
Ha^npshire. In the springs of tho Hima
layas, the Ganges, Indus, Bramapootra
and Yangtze-Klang rivers take their rise.
The upper eastern area forms the Kuen
Luen, and it is covered with glaciers of
such magnitude as to dwarf those of
Switzerland. It continues in a northern
sweep, called the Allyn Taph, and is no
less prolonged than the Himalayas. From
It descends- the Hoangho.
The Himalayas and the Kuen Luen In
close between them the massive tableland
of Tibet. Hardly any part of Asia has
been less explored. The Importance of
Tibet to us cons.i3ts In that we may use it
as a criterion of siie. . The American more
than the European is accustomed to large
dimensions. European standards of space
and distance are small. American stand
ards are large. Asiatic standards are im
mense. Tibet occupies a minors place
upon the map. Yet it comprises an area
twice as great as that of the thirteen
States which formed the American
Union. The Indian peninsula, of which
the Himalayas determine the extent
while they form its northern boundary. In
cludes a territory three times aa great as
that of Tibet.
The main western chain, which radiates
from the focal center of the Pamirs .under
the name of the Klboorz Mountains,
serves as the northern backbone of the
tableland of Persia and becomes the
southern barrier of the Caspian Sea. It
loses its distinctive features In the gen
eral confusion which marks the Armen
ian plateau. Then afterward it emerges
as the Taurus and Anti-Taurus chains
which, rudely parallel, determine the
physical features of Asia Minor. From
the Armenian plateau descend the Tigris
and Euphrates to blÂ°nd their waters alonjj
their lower courses and shortly after their
junctions to enter the Persian Gulf.
Southward from the Pamirs are spread
out the fortress masses of the Hindoo
Koosh. A portion of this chain creates
the fastnesses of Afghanistan. Another
portion under various names and with
gradually lessening height keeps on till
its farther spurs touch the Arabian Sea.
It forms the western wall of India.
Northward from tne Pamirs extend the
Tienshan or Celestial Mountains. They
rise like a rampant against the desert
steppes of Turkestan and inclose as a pro
tecting wall the tableland of Central Asia.
Still farther north, apparently detached
from the general system and yet con
nected with it by lower elevations which
in any crtier continent would be reckoned
mountain?, we find the vast Altai group.
TMs'may be considered the watershed be
tween* Central and Northern Asia. Yet
none of the mighty rivers which they feed
flows toward the south. Instead these
rivers traverse Siberia and reach the Arc
tic Ocean as the Obi, the Yenisei and the
Lena.
Nor must the Caucasian Mountains,
which stretch from the Black Sea to the
Caspian, be omitted. They have their
roots In both Asia and Europe and may
be regarded as the northwest succession
of the Elboorz. .. -
The plains, spread ouÂ£ along the banks
of the majestic streams, are in keeping
with the magnitude of the parent moun
tains and with the enormous volune sent
down by them to the sea. The lowlands
through which ' the Siberian rivers plow
their wav are far to the north. All of
those great floods discharge their waters
beyond the Arctic .circle. Those regions
are not tempting to population now. Still
less so were they In the past.
But the enormous natural basin, the
v.idc alluvial plains, In" other and favored
parts of the continent are more inviting.
Reaching back as far**is history and tra
dition can peer we discover three such
j-eglons teeming with population. Nor are
the remote men and women whom we find
.dwellins there, when first, revealed to us,
sunk In savagery and barbarism. As the
veil is drawn away from that rrrst scene
In the annals of the race we behold hu
man beings enjoying the benefits of an
established civilization.
"Whence the first man came is an enig
ma which science, despite her multitude
of marvelous" triumphs, cannot solve.
Upon the human stage the curtain does
not lift until the descendants of far-off
brutish ancestors have risen to the high
estate of civilized men. But their pro
genitors, the men of the ancient ages, the
first born of the world, must have long
remained miserable and savage, unable to
grasp the rudiments of social life.
It is a belief, wldeiy cherished In the
east, that the first spot on which the first
man looked forth wa's a valley in the
Pamirs. There the early tribes stayed
dully among sublime scenes, unconscious
as the animals of any nobler possibilities
and,, caring only to appease physical
wants. At last they wandered through
the passes on the east and south, and,
still wandering, stumbled upon the plain.-*
where generous nature afforded easily ac
quired and abundant food. This Oriental
theory is regarded with approval by many
scholars. Biblical exei;etes claim to dis
cover a curious similarity between many
local names In the Pamirs and others
mentioned In the book of Genesis. If true,
the theory is impossible, of proof. And yet
that exalted plateau may be not only the
focal center from which the mountains of
a continent unroll in tneir Immensity, but
the scene where the fathers of mankind
first opened eyes on the Usht of day. and
whence, with uncertain steps, they began
the cono.uest of the ziobe.
The three centers of primitive civiliza
tion, each of which it reauired unnum
bered centuries to develop, are Chaldca.
India and China. The physical configura
tion of Asia had made them ready for the
coming of man, had otiaDted them to be
the first arenas of his struggles and had
foreordained their future,. Around them
each the mountains extended 'their pro
tecting arms. The Himalayas and the
Hindoo Koosh shut in the Indian valley
of the Ganges. The Chaldean plain of
the Tigris and Euphrates Is inclO3ed by
the hills of Media, the Taurus and the
Lebanon, while solemn Ararat guards the
north. The wide Chinese expanse on the
Yangtze-Kiang and Hoangho has for iu
ramparts the formidable ranges which
are sent out from the central mountain
masses of A3!a.
Â¦ We cannot know -which of the peoples
and of the civilizations, gradually blos
soming In these cradles of fruits and
flowers, was the olde&;. The records of
each are measured by thousands, and lay
claim to scores of thousands of years.* Yei
the records cannot so back to the days

valises checked trt*CHICAGO. Feb. 7.â At the outset trade In
wheat was marked by some excitement occa
sioned by an advance at Liverpool, quite
agreeable to the bullish hopes roused by the
heavy export sales' yesterday. May opened 12
@%c higher at 75U@75^c, and on buying by
commission houses and covering by shorta
rallied during tho flm half hour to 75U<8"75%c
At this Liverpool announced that the advance
on that side was due to buying by Americans.
The market thereupon became flat, and the
bear contingent, assisted by discouraged liqui
dation on the part of longs, sent May " down
to 74?iÂ®74v4c. The pressure on the decline was
very moderate, but the demand came only
from a few small bulls. Trade here became sj
dull that there was ample time to pay atten
tion to the gossiping of alleged wise ones.
Reported export engagements of | sixty loads
brought the shorts- to cover, May rallying to
73%c, the best price of the day.
Corn experienced a moderately active day
and a fair volume of trade. The close was
firm with MayÂ»4c up at 3ST4c.
Oats were dull and featureless. May closed
a shade up at 25U@25Hc. â¢ . ;Â¦, .
Provisions ruled dull but firm and feature
less. May pork closed unchanged, and lard
and ribs each 2*4'S'5c higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

NEW TORK, Feb. 7.-The clamour cf the
va6t prÂ«ject*Â»<i stÂ«>el combination^ swept over
Wall street to-day and dominated the specu
lation almost completely, a renewed upward
movfmfnt in Union Pacific formed a., effective
tupplemwit. The Fte*l Ftooks all opened notablv
â¢trong and had rood advances under the flood
at buying orders attracted by the significant
admissions from authorities In the steel trade
a* to thÂ» reality cf pending negotiations. The
enormous volum* of the offerings during the
flrtt hour, especially In Federal Steel made it
<lÂ»zr to traders that holders of very large
Â¦ inorntg of this stock were willing to avail
themselves of the good news to realize profits.
The amount of nock encountered at Â»5 was
apparently unlimited, and not only Federal
t.ut the whole market staggered under It.
Consideration of the known facts regarding
the fteel negotiations disclosed that a good
.Ual was being taken for granted by the specu
lator*. That Mr. Carnegie had Indicated a
willingness to pell the control of his property
Feemed to be admitted, but the surmises re
garding the further plans for the "billion doV
lar steel trust" had evidently run considerably
beyond the- ascertained facts. There were sig
nificant Intimations thrown out that the whole
negotiation was Â«111 in a somewhat delicate
*laxe, such as lfft the possibility that un
bridled speculation in the securities concerned
â¢night seriously Interfere with its consumma
tion. The idea of beinÂ»t long of the steel stocks
Â¦Â«vlth -the proposed combination collapsed and
abandoned wa* sufficient to cause a nervous
state of mind among some of the speculators
who have taken on enormous lines of these
*tock*. The appearance of Incide selling added
to their perturbation. With the speculative
position thus made vulnerable, the stocks were
fcubjecte^i tc severe handling during the after-'
noon. There was a momentary pause in the

CLOSING
NEW TORK. Feb. 7.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial - cablegram* says:
The tone of the market here to-day was good,
the announcement .that the Bank of England
had reduced Its minimum discount rate one
half of 1 per cent exerting a favorable In
fluence. Consols, however, were weak In an
ticipation of the announcement ' orÂ» the new
war loan. The American department was ac
tive throughout the session and the whole list
was affected more or less. Much of the ac
tivity was due -to the participation of the
general public. The Continent operated on the
selling: side. A conspicuous feature was Union
Pacific. It opened above parity, then relapsed,
but closed strong at 3SVi on support from New
York. Silver was weak under pressure of
American selling.

OMAHA. Feb. 7.â C. M. Hays, president
of the Southern Pacific Railroad, stopped
off hi Omaha last night, his special car
being sidetracked while he conferred with
the officials of the Union Pacific Railway
at headquarters. President Hays is bound
for New York City, whither he was called,
it la said, by the new owners of the South
ern Pacific Railroad.
"While the full import of hl3 mission to
Omaha could not be ascertained, enough
information was pained to-day to make
certain that the Southern Pacific and
Union Pacific officials are Retting toge.ther
for the first time in chÂ«> history of these
roads; that traffic dealt which will revolu
tionize the traffic sheets between the great
lakes and the Pacific Coast are to be
formulated: that the Ogden gateway is to
be shut and sealed against all business
which It may be possible to route via the
Union Pacific and Kansas* Pacific from
Missouri River points; that new train
schedules are about to be put into effect
which will reduce the running time be
tween Chicago and San Francisco from
nix to eight hours; that close connections
will be nrade at Opden by atl through
trains, and th.it the arbitrary practice
long Vn vogue by the Southern Pacific peo
ple with reference- to receiving business
at Ogden will .soon be supplanted by a
concert of action which will greatly facil
itate business. 1 >
It is said here that the announcement
of the closing of the Og-den gateway will
be made In New York in a few days. It
will bottle up the Denver and Rio Grande
ac Salt Lake and raise to the importance
of a trunk line the old Denver and. Chey
enne "branch of the Union Pacific. This
order will also affect the west-bound busi
ness of the Missouri Pacific and Rock Isl
and roads.

CHICAGO, Feb. 7.â President Charles T.I.
Hays of -the Southern Pacific system,
passed through Chicago to-day en route
to New York for a conference with the
Morgan-Harrlman interests. The Record,
to-morrow will say:
. "It is claimed that the Eastern trip of
Mr. Hays has reference to a plan which
will make him the common executive head
of the Union and Southern Pacific sys
tems. President Burt of the Union Pacific
beinp elevated to the chairmanship of the
board. In this way. It is argued, the
greatest efficiency of operation could be
secured, vast economies could be intro
duced and the advantages of the recent
deal could be develop<><i to the utmost.
The headquarters of both roads, It la ru-'
mored, will be in Omaha.
New Issue of Common Stock.
NEW YORK. Feb. Zâ The Commercial
Advertiser says: "There Is Rood reason
for the belief that the Union Pacific Rail
road will finance the recent purchase of
the controlling interest in the Southern
Pacific by an Issue of new Union Pacific
common stock. The. plan is understood
to issue new stock at par. and the entire
proposed Issue has practically been un
derwritten."

DEATH REAPS AN
AWFUL HARVEST
ROME, Feb. 7.â Signor Saracco tendered
the resignation of the Cabinet this morn
ing. King Victor Emmanuel will consult
with the- President of th,e Senate and
Chamber of Deputies and the various par
ty leaders to-day and to-morrow before
designating a new Premier. H? is con
fronted with a task of great difficulty,
owing to the chaotic conditions of the
Parliamentary parties. The majority,
which defeated the Government yester
day, consisted pf a transitory coalition of
the members of the. Right and Left, only
the Rudini group supporting the Govern
ment, the Socialists opposing the Cabinet
because they considered It not sufficiently
liberal, while the Rightists accused it of
lacking a coherent policy and yielding to
the Socialists. The fall of the Ministry
was thus due to diametrically opposed
reasons. Yesterday the coalition disap
peared immediately after the vote, the
parties being bitterly antagonistic as re
gards a general policy, so the first Par
liamentary crisis the new King has to
solve appears to be a perfect Gordian
knot. . â¢
After the announcement of the resigna
tion of the Cabinet in the Senate and in
the Chamber of Deputies- the Chamber
adjourned sine die.
The papers consider it probable that
Signor Villa or.Slgnor Saracco will be
chosen to form, the new Ministry. . .

A CHINESE COOK
TOPEKA, Kans., Feb. 7.â City Attorney
Grepg to-day dismissed the charge against
Mrs. Nation for smashing the Senate sa
loon on Tuesday. He threw all the re
!Â«ponsibility for prosecuting the crusader
on the State and said:
"The city has no ordinance covering the
destruction of personal property, but un
der the laws of Kansas the State can
prosecute Mrs. Nation if what s'he de
stroyed can be proved to be personal
property."
The City Counselor and an attorney
employed to prosecute Mrs. Nation in the
State, courts had. he continued; sustained
hie view that she could not be legally
prosecuted by the city, and he therefore
announced the dismissal of the case.
Mrs. Nation, who was sitting at a table
i,M front of the Police Judge"? dosk. cried
'Amen! Thank you, Mr. Gregg; I al
ways paid you had too good a face to be
on the side of sin."
Then, rising in her seat and turning
about so she could fare the women who
had crowded the courtroom. Mrs. Nailon
began to sing "Praise God from whom
all blessings flr>w." Her followers took
up the strain and the courtroom 'was tem
porarily turned into a praise-meeting.
Judge Magraw commanded that the dis
turbance cease, but Chief of Police Stahl.
who had openly favored Mrs. Nation's
work, interrupted with "Go ahead, ladios,
and ping all you want to." and they did,
breaking out with even greater vigor with
the words. "God be with you till we meet
again."
I'nable io continue business, court ad
journed and Judge Magraw left the build
ing. Mrs. Nation, the songs ended, took
<*hief Stahl to task for not destroying the
liquors seized by his men In raiding the
saloons, but soon went out. followed by
her husband. Later Mrs. Nation went to
the High School and by invitation ad
dressed the pupils. The senior class had
adopted resolutions commending her work
and Mrs. Nation was given a hearty wel
come hy the 'children. While she was
speaking Mrs. Nation was handed a pass
to the Senate chamber, sent to her by
Lieutenant Governor Richter.
Mrs. Nation addressed both houses of
the lvegislature this afternoon on the evils
of the saloon traffic. She presented herself
at the door of the House at 5:30, with the
request that shÂ«^ be allowed to speak. The
request was voted upon, and by a large
majority Mrs. Nation was allowed to
speak. Some few voted no.
"I heard those noes." said Mrs. Nation,
aÂ» she walked upon the clerk's platform.
"I wonder why those people voted that
way. Have I ever offended you? Why do
you object to my talking? But, then,
don't I know that those noes come from
the liquor traffic?"
A storm of '.aughter swept over the
House, and it was several minutes before
Mrs. Nation could proceed.
"Hold up your hatchet." yelled some
one in the rear, but Mrs. Nation only
Â«miled.
"Thank God. the noes are in the minor
ity." continued Mrs. Nation. "I come to
you to-day, men. as a Woman, as a grand
mother. I come to tell you our sentiments.
I am glad of this opportunity to speak to
fathers, husband?, protectors of wives
who sit at their firesidesâ who know a
woman's heart and her interests. .
"Now. gentlemen." said Mrs. Nation in
an earnest tone, "you can remedy this
condition by knocking' out the clause in
the prohibitory law which gives the Coun
ty Attorney the right to summon wit
nesses but which refuses him the right
to compel them to testify. You would do
so if common murderers were running
loose; why not do it in this case?
"Now, men,", she said, ."I am pleading
with you. I have been forced to do this
smashing business. 1 am going to tell the
truthâ you have not been doing your duty.
A good, solid vote is the best thing in the*
world with which to smash the saloons.
You refused me the vote and I had to use
a rock.
"The saloon man Is a malicious pauper.
He thrives off the life-blood of the men
of this nation. 'Whisky makes perjurem.
I would not believe a Jointkeeper on oath,
even if it was only' about a dog fight." â¢
Mrs. Nation addressed the Senate along
the same lines. â¢

TRAIN IS DERAILED
AT LABKSPUB STATION
Smoking Car Turns Over and Its Oc
cupants Are Badly Cut and
Bruised.
SAX RAFAEL* Feb.- 7.â The smoking
car of the 12:30 narrow-gauge train from
this city was derailed and capsized about
fifty yards north of Larkspur Station to
day. No lives were lost, though many
passengers were cut and bruised In the
turnover. The train left here on time in
charge of Conductor A. Murry and Engi
neer J. Drlscoll. When a short way
from Larkspur the train slowed down to
stop at the station. In crossing a wagon
road between two culverts the smoking
car, which was attached to the engine,
jumped the track. The derailed car was
dragged along the ties about thirty yards
when It pitched over on Its side. In this
position it was dragged a short distance
through the cut before the engine could
be stopped. When the train was brought
to a standstill the train crew and passen
gers of the other coaches -hurried to give
assistance to the people In the overturned
car. At first it was thought that many
had been seriously injured. As they be
gan to climb through the doors and
broken windows, each bearing his little
cut or bruise, the excitement fabated.
Among those who were, injured are: A.
Cajal, cut on head: George M. Dodge, ex-
County Surveyor, cut on nose and hands:
I>. Garzoll, Bolinas, injured in the leg:
Fredrick Mehl. San Rafael, cut on head;
Louis Smith, San Rafael, sprained knee;
Hong You. lacerated hand and Injured
leg. James Roberts was thrown from his
seat and believes that his back is serious
ly injured. There were about a dozen
Chinamen in the car and all were cut and
bruised. . \
The passengers who were In the other
coaches were* considerably shaken up and
frightened. They were: Mrs. .M. E. Coit.
Mrs. Fitzroy. Mrs. W. Magee, Mrs. N. S.
Ross, Clinton Jones, the well-known
broker of San Francisco, and Attorney T.
J. Butts of Santa Rosa.
The cause of the accident is unknown.
The train was slowing up for the station
at the time. The engine and the two
other coaches did not leave the track. It
was a peculiar accident and the railroad
people cannot account for it. The wrecked
car. had just come from the machine
shops, where it had been thoroughly over
hauled. Several hours after the accident
the track was cleared and travel resumed.

proprietary and speculative .and not subject to any easement in fa
vor of t the "Inhabitants of the State" or the "citizens of the United
States for the purposes of navigation and commerce and Â¦ fishery;
and that the lands between high and low tide lines are not covered
by navigable water*, our task is "not a hard one. and. numerous de- â¢
ci.Â«lons light our way to a correct solution of the problems before us.
Upon the question of the compromise Judge Ogden says:
The Supreme Court having construed the compromise of 186S or
the ratification of lS6t *is twin* effective. It only remains for th4s
court to Rive effect to them.
While 1 am aware that the learned Chief Justice has used the
words "wholly void," "was a gross and evident excess of power" an<}
"absolutely void" in reference to the conveyance of May 17, 1852. and
the various confirmatory ordinances prior to lxÂ«<j,- yet I am compelled
to believe that these words were not uÂ»fd in their strict sense.
An estate which Is void in law cannot be confirmed.
20 Cat. 97. Zottmin vs, San Francisco.
24 Cal. 5S6, Branham vs. Mayor of Pan Jose. 4
32 Cal. 60'i. Barr vs. Sehroeder.
This is another reason why it must be held that the ratification
was retroactive.
In 1SC4 the charter of the city provided that all sales and leases
of property belonging to the city should be by public auction. (St&t.
1834, p. 187. Sec. 13.) Similar provisions have always been held man
datory.
Surely. If the title to the property . In ouestlon had not passed
from the city prior thereto (that is to say provisionally upon the rati
fication of the Legislature) any new conveyance thereafter must be
under and in accordance with the terms of the charter or be held
void.
Summing up Judge Ogden says:
It follows from the vlcwn 1 ere expressed that It Is unimportant
whether the grant to Oarpemier was made good in lSfilor 1S6S. In
either case the ratification made eood the ortgirral conveyance, and
only such streets as may have been dedicated at the time of said
Krant became impoHed us a charge upon the land.
Between the passage of. the act incorporating: the town (May 4,
1S52, and May 17. IV>2, the date of the passage of the ordinance abdi
cating to Carpentier all the â¢ water front, the city declared or dedi
cated no. street through the land in ttuestlon. nor was there any plaf
or map of said city showing streets to the southern or western bound
ary line or the line of low tidÂ«> in the estuary, but by the ordinance/
granting to Carpentier the land In o.ueFtlon the policy of the town
wns shown to be. that there should b<? three streets open to deep water
nr the line or low tide, to wit: Main street, F or G street and D or
K street, and it was ".herein provided that said CarDtntler should
build wharves at the foot thereof. It -Is true that the consideration
for the promise of Carpentier to build said ' wharves was
afterward by our Supreme .Court declared to be held void.
(13 Cal. 540,. Oakland vs. Carpentier.) Yet. the ordinances
of. the city and. communications of Caroentier in evi
dence in this ease show that he- did build the. wharf at the foot of
Main street (now Broadway), and It was accepted by the city (ordi
nance January 1, 1853); that he did build the wharf at the foot of G
street and the same was aDDroved (ordinance Aug. 2. 1853); and that
the city agreed that the wharf proposed for the foot of D or E
streets might be built at the foot of Castro or Grove streets. .
It is in evidence that the owners of the land at the foot of
Broadway are not before this court, and their rights can not be
affected by this decree, b'ut as to O street and the street accepted by
the city irf lieu of D or E streets it will be adjudeed that the city
has an easement thereon to the navicable waters of the bayâ the
estuary of San Antonio.
The formal appeal to the Supreme Court will be made by the
city. That court will then be called rpon t/> say whether Judge
Ogden's view of the case as to the effect of the Merritt com
promise is upon the lines laid down in the original decision. If
Judge Ogileii be sustained the watpr front company owns these
patches of land. If the Supreme. Court shall hold that the title
to the water front lands $\(l not vpst until 1868. the city has
title and can open all the. streets that were dedicated in 185b
through to ship channel without condemnation and purchase.
The Transcontinental Passenger Asso
ciation will meet in Chicago next Tues
day and the session promises to be a live
ly one. One of tho first subjects taken up
will be an attempt to arrange matters so
that there will be no. possibility of a rate
war developing when the Epworth
LoaguerB start for this city, where they
will hold their annual convention in July.
Some such action seems absolutely
necessary in view of present alleged con
ditions. The agreement of the officers of
the Western roads that no free transpor
tation should be Riven to influence pas
senger traffic stands .in danger, of b*lng
smashed to pieces, owing to the keen com
petition for the Epworth League business.
The Union Pacific is said to have started
the trouble by offering free transporta
tion to officers of the Epworth League
who will wield their influence to secure
business for that road." To meet this com
petition other lines are offering one. free
ticket to any one who secures ten passen
gers. This would enable a party securing
several hundred passengers to get enough
free tickets to start a ticket office of his
own for the sale of these tickets and reap
a rich harvest, it is claimed that there
is little difference between giving away
free tickets and paying commissions, and
if the practice is not stopped the anti
commission agreement is certain to suffer.
George T. Nicholson, passenger traffic
manager of the Santa Fe Railroad, has
devised -a new plan to prevent the man
ipulation of inter-line tickets. His scheme
will be discussed at the next meeting of
the American Association of General Pas
senger Agents that takes place next
Thursday in Chicago. Mr. Nlcnoison pro
poses to place opposite each railroad sta
tion appearing in the official guide a num
ber which shall apply to the station for
all time to come. The custom of print
ing the destination on tickets is to be
abolished. The names up to the gate
ways only are to be printed. Then the
official number of the station of destina
tion is to be punched in the tickets with
a perforating stamp*.
Those precautions, with the use of safe
ty paper only, for tickets, which paper
can be obtained only from the official
printer, will it is claimed, absolutely pre
vent the manipulation of the tickets.
The severe rains of the past week- have
resulted in several washouts on the lines
of the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe.
â¢Manager FUlmore of the Southern Pacific
said yesterday that all trains were de
layed several hours, and that -the .wash
outs were so bad on the Santa Fe road be
tween Stockton, and Bakersfleld' that the
Southern Pacific had to haul all- trains
between these points for both companies.
President Hays of the Southern Pacific

OAKLAND. Feb. 7.â The second trial of the water front
case has resulted in a decision by Superior Judge Og
den which virtually .calls upon the Supreme Court to
again define Its views upon the litigation. Judge Og
den's opinion, filed to-day, takes the ground that the
famous Merritt compromise of 1S68, upon which the Supreme
Court based the validity of. the water front company's title
to certain of the water front lands, is retroactive, and ope
rates to make good that title back as far as 1852. The effect
of the decision, if Judge Ogden's view of the Supreme Court
judgment be sustained. Is to give the "Water Front Company,
title to the various pieces of land through which streets were
opened by the Town Trustees In 1855. ' ,
The decisio/i leaves but a definite line upon two streets;
namely, !D or Grove street .and G or Market street. ! These.
it is possible, were made open and dedicated thoroughfares )n
1S52, and are therefore now public streets. Judge Ogden pays',
with relation to Broadway, that the owners at the foot of that
street cannot be affected by a decree of his court, as they are
not before it. It is< shown, however, that Broadway was in
cluded in the same category as that of the streets he specific
ally cites.- The Broadway title is now in litigation in the United
States Circuit Court.
His Honor reasons that the retroactive effect of the Merritt
compromise is such as to put into question, the proposition
whether the city owned the land that In 1S53 it declared to be
streets all along the south and west shores of the water
front. "When the Town Trustees that year opened these
streets they did it upon the theory that the town owned the
property, namely, as far out as the low-tide line.
In his decision to-day Judpe Ogden in the following language
passes en to the Supreme Court the question whether the city
did own it. or whether it was in private ownership by Carpen
tier and others:
The finding, thrrefbre. will be that all of the streets declared
opened to the line of lew tide on the south and west sides of the
city prior to 1S6S Constituted and became public Btreets; provided at
the time of the passage of such ordinance the land was the property
of the city.
"William R. Davis, chief counsel :n the water front suits for
the city, points out that the whole question is whether the city
has title or whether the Water Front Company has title to these
small sections, of land at the foot of the streets between the
mainland,' where they now terminate, and the line of low tide;
Under no circumstances, he says, can the city be prevented
from extending those streets across this land, lying beyond the
Peralta grant line, even if the courts shall finally decide that
it belongs to the Water Front Company. The city at any time
can acquire this land by purchase or by condemnation when
there shall be a demand for the extension of the streets, even
by piers to ship channel.
"The present opinion," Mr. Davis says, "interprets the re
cent decision of the Supreme Court as to the Merritt compro
mise to mean that the early conveyances of the water, front to
Carpentier were made operative in 1S52. their own date, and not
in 186S, when the final compromise of all the deeds, grants and
previous adjustments were made. Therefore inasmuch as nearly
all of the streets were dedicated in 1835, thirteen years before
the compromise of 1S68. the city's title was not good to the prop
erty through which it opened streets by the dedication. But
Broadway, D or E and F or G were dedicated by the grant of
1852."
At the outset Judpe Osden in his decision reviews the Su
preme Court opinion as to the effect upon the large area of
lands contended for by the Water Front Company. Then he
says:
Subsequent to the 17 1 ii day of Mar, 1S32, and before the 2d day of
April, 1S6S, the city of Oakland declared a large, number of streets
of the city open and public afreets; some of them to the line of hlfth
tide, others to the line cf low tide and others again to the southern
boundary of the city, which would bring them to Â»he line ot low
tide on the Alameda shore.
The question now presented to this court upon the retrial of said
cause Is: Which streets have been by the city of Oakland dedicated
to public use and are imposed as a charge upop the land in question?
In determining this question It becomes important to determine the
effect of the decision of the Supreme Court.
Is the tract In question when covered by the tides subject to the
easement in favor of the public for the purposes of navigation and
fishery?
In Knsland the ebb and flow of the tide constituted the leg"\l test
of the navigability of waters and "tide waters" and "navigable
water?" were Fjniinymni's terms.
I am constrained to bcliev-p. however, that the Supreme Court in
tÂ»ndM to hold in its opinion nied hpreln that at least after th* title
from the city vested in the grantee. Carpentier, it was not nubjpct to
any fucIi easement in favor of the city or the inhabitants of the
State, and that said lards were not a part of the estuary.
This I.-inctiMKe If used:
"ThÂ» conclusion. I think, necessarily follows that from and after
the 2d day of April. lSf,8. the city of Oakland ceased to be owner, as
trustee or otherwise, of any portion of her water front except those
portions secured to her by the compromise of that date, and such
streets, thoroughfares and other parcels as may have been previously
dedicated to public use. As to all such places the transfer to the
Â¦\Vater Front Company mid its assigns was subject to the public ease
ment, and the city as trustee for the public is no doubt entitled to
a decree In this action df fining her right- of control over the lands
fo dedicated. V
If the construction to be placed upon the set of the legislature
declaring: the estuary of San Antonio navlKable (Statute W52, p. 182),
(Political Code. SÂ»ci>. 23Â«Â«-2349) v.-as effective to make that stream nav
igable within the linen cf ordinary high tide, all of it had been
dedicated to public uÂ«e, and thereby a grant of any part of ihe
lands under these waters would subject them to such easement.
But- the Supreme Court announced no such rule and undoubtedly
proceeded upon the theory that the shore line (that Is to say. the
line between low find hiRh tide) when sold by the StaÂ«e became pro
prietary or speculative lands and not land covered by navigable
waters.
If navipable waters ronstst only of that portion' of the sea below
the line of low tide (and the lanRiiage "of the learned Chief Justice
and Justices McFarland and Garoutle so convinces me) then the. land
above that line, like any other property, is by this decision made sub
ject to sale and transfer. A -transfer by the city, while vesting
title in its jcrantee. still leaves in Its hands the political power to
condemn such portions thereof as may be necessary for the use of
streets.
Taklnp. then, as our premise that the lands in question - were

CHIHUAHUA, Hex., Feb. T.-^'ord has
just reached here of one of the most ter
rible Â¦ mining- disasters that ever occurred
In Mexico. An explosion in the San An
dres mine, situated in a remote locality of
the Sierra Madres, in the western part of
the State of Durango, caused the-death of
eighty-seven men, women and children
and injured many others. The catas
trophe was due to the explosion of several
hundred cases of dynamite, which was
stored In an underground chamber of the
mine. Electric wires, connecting with the'
hoisting machinery, passed through the
room in which this dynamite was stored,
and it is supposed that these wires be
came crossed, thereby causing a tire
which set oft the dynamite.
All of the killed and Injured were qn
the surface, most of them occupying res
idences immediately over the underground
workings of the mine.- The explosion tore
away the whole top of the mountain on
which the village of miners was located,
and men, women and children were blown
to pieces. Among-, those who were killed
was Herman Luetzraan. the superinten
dent of the mine, and all the members of
his family.
At the time of the explosion there were
several hundred miners at work in the
lower workings of the mine, and. strange
to say, none of them was seriously in
jured, although they .were all seriously
shocked by the force of the explosion.
They rushed to the surface through one
of the shafts that was not filled with
de.bris and the sight that met their eyes
in the almost complete destruction of the
village Js indescribable. The work of
gathering up the fragments of the victims
was begun and they were placed together
and buried in one grave. Summons
was sent to neighboring camps for sur
geons to attend the injured, and it was
some time before this aid arrived.
The' ban Andres mine Is the most cele
brated silver mine in Mexico.- It is valued
at $20,000,000. It has produced many mil
lions of dollars' worth of ore.

â rÂ»
| The long voyage of :h'e men of the Thir
i ty-seventh Volunteer Infantry ended yes
terday morning when they were landed
from the steamers McDowell and Resolute
at the Presidio wharf.
Headed by the Thirtv-sevcnth regimen
tal band, they were mru'ehed up the dock,
at the head of which 'they were met by
the Third Artillery band and the entire
garrison force, under command of Colo
; nel Rawles, which escorted the returning'
regiment to its quarters in Model Camp.
Along the iir.e of march stood ljundreda of
civilians, giving a hearty welcome to the
heroes from Manila. When near the camp
prepared for the volunteers, the men un
der Colonel Rawles were halted, allowing
the Thirty-seventh to jiass on. It was ;i
pretty sight, the men of the. post standing
trim and erect, with arms at present,
while the veterans of the two years 1 skir
mishing in the islands marched to their
tents.
In the tents stoves, coal and wood ha'l
been placed in abundance, and it required
but very few moments for the soldiers to
start a cheery blaze, ueposit their blan
kets and fall into comfortable positions
and prepare to receive the visitors throng
insr the camp.
The recruits who nave * not yet seen
service in the Philipvines were not be
hindhand in welcoming the volunteers.
The Provisional battalions were at drill
when the men passed the parade ground,
and they promptly stood at attention, at
the command of their officers, and pre
sented arms'as the heroes filed past.
M. Cheatha-m, a brother of Colonel
Cheatham of the Thirty-seventh, is here
from Tenessee. and promise? a hearty re
ception to the boys from that State in the
regiment upon their rettirn home. He 13
making every effort to have the men re
turn in a body after receiving their dis
charges. Colonel Jocelyn, who will have
control of the mustering: out details, has
; secured quarters in tiie Phelan biuldingr.
where a force of clerks will start in im
mediately preparing rolls, and attending
to preliminary matters. It will require
i fully two weeks to ret the necessary pa
pers in proper shape. In the meantime
the men will remain in camo. where every
I liberty within reason will be given them.

John Shea, deputy poundkeepcr, who
was charged with battery upon Mrs. Eliz-
Mb*>th Green, 414 Clement street. Wednes
day rooming. January 30, was tried before
Judge Fritz yesterday, and after hearing
the evidence the Judge convicted the de
fondant aid ordered him to appear for
sentence this morning. Mrs. Green was
averse to prosecuting the case, as Shea
had bef n suspended by the poundmaster,
but his attorney insisted upon a trial,
claiming that h<> was innocent.
The Jir.-^t -wit â¢!*Â¦-Â«Â». examined was E. F\
Green, husband of the complaining wit
ness, v ho testified to his wife's arm and
wrist being- distolored aJid swollen after
the encounter with the defendant. Mrs.
Green thf-n to!d the story of how Shea
had thrown the net over her dog in th*
1' t adjoining her bouse after she had
reached the animal and her struggle with
him. He twisted her wrist so hard to
compel her t<> :ct go her hold of the dog
that *he almost fainted with pain. He
5>uile<i the dog violently away from her.
Another man came to the defendant's as-
Pi.^tance ar.d seized her by the arm so
roughly that the black marks of his fin
; ra were visible on her arms for several
days.
Mrs. H. O. Witt. Miss Lulu Guthrie and
Miss Alice M. Guthrie. neighbors of Mrs.
Green, testified to stp;ns- the struegle in
the lot between hfr and the defendant.
Secretary Holbrook .Â«f the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals testi
fied as to the condition of the lot. which
was fenced in. and when cross-examined
a? to the defendant's reputation he re
plied that it was bad.
This closfKl the case for the prosecu
tion, and Shea took the stand. He testi
fied that he had caught the dog in the
n<t before Mr?. Green attempted to take
it from him. He denied that he seized
her by the wrist and tw-!s<Â«-0 U. He sim
ply pusbed her aside, ho Bald. Stevens,
the driver, came up and pr.ibbed her by
the arm. teUing her that the easiest way
vu to drop the dop- Some women foupht
harder than Mrs. GreÂ«n to save the'r dogs.
He said he always seized a dog by the
Â«>ars so that it oould not bite him. He
admitted in cross-examination that he
had no right to go into a closed lot.
O. H. Stevens', the driver, denied that
her t-oiz^d Mrs. Oretn by thÂ«Â» arm. James
Hu^he*. another deputy, testified that ho
saw Shoa with the net over the dog and
Mr?. Gr^en approaching him. He was
on his way to the wapon with another

five pounds if the race was run in muddy

E. C. Hopper, secretary of the American

Trom recent Enellah and Eastern ad
vices It Is said Milt Henry will pilot the

son. This probably accounts for the fact
that the Keenes were after, the services
of Mounce*to do thei.- riding on the New

Track Hates.
Or. Rowell's recent purchase. Alee,' ruled
a pronounced favorite for the closing mllo
run. He was ridden- by Henry and fin
ished fifth, the purs*}' falling to Uarda,
which beat Sunello UN3 than a length.
Milt Henry put up a very Moppy ride
on Telamon, favorite for the mile number
exclusively for three-year-olds. Waiting
when there was a- ridiculously slow pace
set, he zigzagged through the stretch and
lost out to Grafter by a half-length. Ber
nota. the well-backed one, ran third,
plainly showing a dislike for weight.
In the mile and seventy yard selling af
fair Burdock, piloted by Henry, defeated
a bunch of ragged ones. Closing a 9 to 5
ohance. the Montana' bred horse headed
Parmenion through tho stretch, winning
with plenty to spare. Racetto was third.
With Lavator.Handkapper, Torslna and
Syharls scratched from the fifth, a feeven
furlong jaunt, also decided under selling
conditions. Good Hop* -was Installed a 6 to
5 favorite, l^ater thÂ© mare's odds drifted
to twos. Dominick n r ho had the mount,
made too much early u.-*e of her. and was
unplaced. Rollick way about the only
starter to have his price cut, and under J.
Ransch's excellent hnnulinec turned up ah
easy winner over Wyoming i and Espi
rando.
Starting for tho first time in the colors
of Caesar Young, Meehanus enjoyed a
pronounced call In the betting on the first
event, a slx-furlong sprint. He displayed
a spasmodic burst of speed and then faded
away. In a hard drive Buchanan on Sad
Sam, a 5 to 1 chance, got to the wire a
head before Rio de Altar. Selde ran third.
Rain fell almost incessantly throughout
the racing and the weather .was raw and
biting. Burdock and Waring were the
only favorites to come through.
WNER SAM HILDRETH sent

mudlark as Lennep, carrying 108 pounds,
look cheap and * trashy. Away fourth,

Valley Road Receives Terminal Priv

The Supervisors' Street Committee re
ported yestecdny in favor of the passago
of the ordinance granting the San Fran
cisco and San Joaauin Valley Railway
Company a franchise to construct twelve
tracks, together with all necessary
Kwitehos, from its terminal, on the north
side of Bryant street, across that stree:
to the ferry slip and wharf .on Bryant
street, between Alain and Spear, At tlm
suggestion of Chairman Curtis a condition
was Incorporated in the bill that thw
street be maintained a f . the level of tho
rails with material batisfactory to the
Hoard of Public Works. "Captain Payson,
vice president of the road, accepted tho
condition., â¢
The privilege Is necessary In order that
the company may handle its business
properly from the ferry slip and wharf.
The committee also recommended tho
passage of the resolution directing tho
Board of Works not to remove certain
fences obstructing streets In the Univer
sity Mound. Bay View and other outslda
districts before October 1, 1901. Repre
sentatives of the Federated Mission Im
provement Clubs appeared In opposition
to the measure, while F. CJray, M. Jlollit
and M. Johnson favoied Its passage on
the ground that the milkmen in the dis
tricts named required time to move away.
An ordinance providing for the naviiur
of Pine street, between Sansome and Bat
tery, with asphalt on a concrete base,
was recommended for passage.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee yes
terday directed the chief of the dep'art
ment of electricity to report on the peti
tion of the American District Telegraph
Company for the designation of common
points for the crossing of certain streets
by overhead wires or cables. A number
of petitions. Including that of the Olympic
Club, for a permit to store crude petro

MAY FIGHT IN LOS ANOEJ-ES.
All of the Principals Willing to Mest
In the arguments to-day between coun
sel as to the competency of evidence and
the submitting: of certain documents there
were sharp allusions to tho action of Gov
ernor Nasn In wTitinar to the Sheriff and
ProeBCUtins Attorney regarding the pro
posed contest while it was belne tried on
its merits in the courts. These argu
ments showed that' tho principal Issue 13
Â¦whether the event of February 13 will be
a boxing contest or a prizefight. , j
If a permanent Injunction is granted
against the event as a nuisance the de
fendants announce that they will deny tho
jurisdiction of the court.
Â¦ Attorney General Sheets addressed the
court In defense of the action of Governor :
Nash, whom, he said, was doing what the
Governor of all other States would do
except the Governor of Nevada. The
questions propounded to the directors of
the Saengerfest Athletic Association as
to what they knew about athletics In
general and the rules of the Marauls of
Queensberry governing fights In particu
lar led to bitter disputes to-dav.
W. M. Hobart was ;lie tint witness for
the defense. He Is a distiller and inter
ested In many Industries In the city. H#
was formerly president of the Chamber of
Commerce and president of the Cincinnati
Musical Festival for many years. He tes
tified to the work â¢ of the Saengerftoi
board, which was building a hall for $33,000
in 1899. and after Its collapse the board
sTpent 1100.000 on the buiiding and thus in
curred a debt of about $65,000 In excess of
what had been raised for the Saengerfest
Hall. The Saenserfest directors are still
carrying this debt and have devised va
rious plans for its liquidation, including
the. proposed contest between Jeffries and
Ruhlin and Martin and Childs. Judge
Harmon objected tojthe testimony of IIo
bart, holding that Bidebtedness, even for
public-spirited enterprises, was not justi
fication for a benefit performance in vio
lation of law. The objection was-'over
ruled. The fact was developed that Ho
bart was a church member and superin
tendent'of a Sunday-3chool. Asked why*
he did not listen to the appeals of the mln,
isterlal associations. Hobart said the min
isters were mistaken. They thought there
was to be a prizefight, when the Baenger
fest Athletic Association had the Mayor's
permit for a boxing contest.
CINCINNATI, Feb. 7.â In thÂ« hearing
on 'the application for an injunction
against the Jeffries-Kuhlln prizefight,
scheduled to occur February 15, the de
fendants offered testimony to-day and will
continue to-morrow. The arguments will
be made Saturday and the decision of
Judge Hollister will probably be reserved
until next week.
Testimony Develops the Fact That
the Principal Promoter of the
Big Fight Is a Church

National Club Gets Permit.
The Supervisors' Police Committee re
ported yesterday in favor of the petition
of the National Sporting Club to hold a
boxing exhibition in March. Manager
Groom stated that Matty Matthews, the
champion welterweight of America and
Otto Cribb, the champion of Australia,
were matched. The Bay City Amateur
Athletic Club was also granted a permit
for a boxing exhibition next month In its
gymnasium.
The committee recommended the in
definite postponement of the ordinance
imposing a license of $G0 per quarter on
pawnbrokers. The old ordinance,' fixing
the license of $31 per quarter,, is still in
force.
Buffalo Lightweight Arrives at the
Palace and Will Rsmain in
This City Until \
Frank, Erne, a champion until he met
Terry McGpvern at reduced weight ' last
July, gilded softly into San Francisco yes
terday, unheralded and unannounced, and
is flow stopping at the Palace. He says
he came West for rest and pleasure and to
escape the severe Eastern weather and
not to fightâ that is, any one but McGov
ern, whom he would be most happy to
meet at 133 pounds.
Erne's arrival Is looked upon with sus
picion, especially by the backers and man
ager of Tim Hegarty, the Australian.
Those men scent the certainty of a match
now between McGovern and Erne before
the Twentieth- Century Club, of which Jim
Kennedy Is matchmaker. Kennedy will
arrive on Saturday, ami then the tale may
or may not be told.
It seems a settled matter that McGov
ern will light before tho Twentieth Cen
tury Club, although the National Sport
ing Club has offered a big-ger guarantee.
Erne expressed himself last night as be
lrijr willing to tight before the club offer
ing the biggest puree. So the bickering
will go on, with Sam Harris, McGovern's
manager and a friend of Jim Kennedy, on
one side and Frank Erne or Hegarty's
manager on the other, with the two clubs
âthe National Sporting and the Twentieth
Century â in the background.
Erne will stay here until May, at which
time he contemplates a return to the
East to study architecture. The. Twen
tieth Century Club has the April license,
and um this date is agreeable to both Erne
and McGovern, this organization looks
tho winner.

Islanders Declare Partiality Was

Will Henceforth. Rule. .
Two gentlemen wearing the title of
Governor of Tahiti have been enjoying
the hospitality of San Francisco during
the past few days. Governor Gallet, who
lias controlled the affairs of Tahiti for the
past three years, left yesterday morning
for N'ew. York, en route to Paris, where
he will be relieved cf his official duties
and placed upon thc retired list. Gov
ernor Petit eafls on Monday for Tahiti.
and upon h5s arrival in the Island will at
once take up the reins of government.
Officially it is given out that Governor
Gallet is to be retired on account of old
age. He has seen twenty-five years of
Government service and the ehows of
fifty winters have begun to whiten his
head. But back of it all there is a Gov
ernment scandal, an appeal from the citi
zens of Tahiti to the home country and
a recall which French courtesy will dis
pose of politely as "retired on account
of old age."
Gallet stand's accused of favoritism to
the Germans. The population of Tahiti
:s marie up of Frencn, English, Germans
Â¦ovA native?. The Government policy of
the home country is a broad and a lib
oral one. favoring equal rights for all ir
respective of nationality. GaJlet, so his
raoft generous critics declare, in wanting
to carry out his Government's policy
went beyond it. Tactlessly striving to
j-how that there was r.o longer any ill
feeling for the former enemy of the
French, he. showered favors upon there,
thereby causing considerable dissatisfac
tion and disturbing the peace of the isl
and.
The rr.atter finally reached the official
ears cf France, and French diplomacy
discovered that Gallet. who ha4 reached
the hfi'f-century mark and had seen
twenty-rive years W Government service.
must be tired and in nÂ«>ed of a rest. And
?r, };e was recalled, and when he reaches
Paris the prolix "ex" is to precede his
Â¦title and a pension will repay the years
]:e fpt-nt in his country's service.
Ecouard Petit, the new Governor for
Tahiti, is a man distinguished in the dip
lomatic, scholastic and literary world,
and who brings plenty cf experience to
help him in his new duties. He is an ad
vocate, a. naval officer, and a professor
of ihe Ecole Colonial. He is well ac
quainted with colonial government and.
bmm been Governor of one of the Mada
gascar group. Many years ago he viÂ«
it^d Tahiti, studied the people and their

observations. It is confidently expected
that Governor Petit will be able to ad

Negligencs in Acknowledg
ing a Deed May Cost
Him .Dear.
Notary Public Lee D. Craig and the
sureties on his bond may yet have to pay
to BeÂ»rend Joost, the capitalist, the sum
of J1000, which the last named is alleged
to have lost .through the negligence of
Craig in acknowledging a deed. The Su
preme Court yesterday reversed the Judg
ment on nonsuit that was awarded Craig
by the trial court and the case has been
sent back to the Superior Court for an
other trial. The decision is an important
one. as It holds that notaries public must
exercise great care in affixing their seals
to papers of a legal character.
Joost brought suit, against Craig and
his sureties for damages charged to havo
resulted from the negligence of the no
tary. The record of the case shows that
in April, 1891,. a man named Fisher, who
was a real estate broker in this city, of
fered to sell to Joost ten lots of land sit
uated In. the county of San Mateo. The
lots were part of the Abbey Homestead
Association, and Joost was familiar with
these lands, having bought a portion of
them. Ho contracted with Fisher for the
property, agreeing to pay $1000 for It.
Joost had an abstract made and found
that the title to Anderson was good. He
notified Fisher that he would, pay for the
land whenever he received a deed from
Anderson properly executed.
: A deed was produced, apparently exe
cuted by Charles A. Anderson of Redwood
City and acknowledged before Notary
Public Crais. The latter certified that
Anderson appeared before him on the 27th
day of April, 1S91. It developed later tha'
the deed was a forgery and was not exe
cuted or acknowledged by Anderson or
by any person known by that name, but
was written by one Frank fe\ Koen.
Thaough this forgery Jocst lost his $1000.
and Immediately brought suit to recover
the amount. Craig, through his counsel,
raised the point that in taking an ac
knowledgment a notary acts Judicially
and is therefore not liable in damages for
mere negligence, but the Supreme Court
held that section 801 sets this contention
at rest.

The wine market was treated to an
other unexpected shake up yesterday. It
came In the shape of an arbitrary ad
vance of ZW cents per gallon In the price
of ordinary clarets, making the figures
25^4 cents pej gallon for naked common
wine f. o. b." San Francisco, or SO cents
including cooperage. The increase was
declared by the California Wine Associa
tion, representing the allied houses, which
are now in absolute control of the market.
There would havo been no surprise at the
advance had it not been for the fact that
prices were raised four cents per gallon a
few weeks ago.-
The announcement caused a great deal
of discussion in the trade, among
whom it was common talk that hints had
been thrown out by the salesmen of the
lAp: corporation that another boost in
Â§ rices might be looked for at any time,
uch news is particularly gratifying to
the wine producers, notwithstanding the
fact that there is. comparatively speak
ing, little wine in tirst hands. The rapid
upward movement of values Is good proof
of the fact that there is a shortage of
stocks of this class of products and that
the demand warrants the action of the
controllers of the market. Furthermore,
it is a guarantee that this demand will be
sufficient to insure excellent prices for
the wines of the coming vintage and sev
eral more to come.. So far as the Inde
pendent houses are concerned, their man
agers are rubbing their hands In glee, as
they are not- responsible for putting the
prices up, but have only to follow the
course marked out by the Wine Associa
tion and reap the benefit.
"The- advance was a. proper one and
purely a business proposition." said Percy
T. Morgan,- president of the California
Wine Association, last night. "There is
a shortage in stocks of such .wines and at
the same time there is a strong demand
for them which is steadily, growing. The
advance we announced was called for by
the situation, and furthermore we are
confident that we are fully competent to
judge of conditions as to supply and de
mand. â¢' One thing you can state for a cer
tainty and that is that there -.will ''be no
drop. If 'anything there will be another
raise." . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ J r - â¢ â¢ .. - -

John Campbell and C. Guy, fel
low lodgers in a house at SloVs
Bush street, rolled down a stair
way leading to their rooms at 3
o'clock yesterday morning and Guy sus
tained injuries from which he -died a few
minutes later while being removed to the
City Receiving 1 Hospital. Campbell was
arrested by Detectives Edward Gibson
and Rlordan and locked up at police head
quarters, until . on examination wounds
necessitating prompt medical attention
were discovered on his. body and he was
taken to the Receiving Hospital for
treatment. Later in " the day he was
charged with murder.
There was no witness to the encounter.
Both men had lived in the house for a
considerable time and the difficulty grew
out of the loss of $25 last Saturday, which
Campbell suspected Guy of having taken
from his clothing during his absence from
his room.
Upon being taken to the hospital it was
found, in addition to a fracture of his
skull, that Guy had broken three ribs in
his descent of the narrow stairway.
Campbell was unconscious when found by
the police and sustained a number or
braises on his face, besides numerous
other abrasions, which the physicians de-
PRICES OF WINE

knocked on his door with a view of ask
ing him to return a portion of the money
if he had taken it. There was never any
response.
"Late last night while going to my
rcom Guy suddenly confronted me In the
hallway and began an unprovoked as
sault. He was a large and woll preserved
man and I had little chance to protect
I myself. We fell from the top landing of
j tho steps to the bottom, a distance of six
teen feet. At the bottom I was uncon
scious and didn't know Guy was injured
until informed by the officers that he was
dying."
Campbell did not express regret over |
the outcome of his desperate battle
and stoutly maintained that he was for- Â¦
tunato in having- escaped death when at- I
tacked by a man of Guy's superior phy?l- j
cal strength. ThfÂ» prisoner does not â¢
weigh over 100 pounds, while his victim
was a man of powerful stature. Camp
bell complained of pains in his chest and
presented a generally battered appear
ance from injuries ho claimed were in
flicted by Guy.-
Campbell has always borne a good repu- j
tation in the neighborhood, where he has
lived for several years, and has worked
steadily at his trade plnce moving there
Guy was -inclined to be reticent concern
ing his former life, but told several people
at the house that hf> had lived in Oregon,
where he was legally separated from his
wife several years ago.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke delivered an ad
dress last evening at Metropolitan Temple
for the benefit of t*he parish of St. John,
Evangelist, his subject being "The Prison
of the Pope.'.'
â¢ A large audience was present to listen
to the address and the speaker was fre
quently applauded. A pleasing musical
programme was also rendered, in which
Miss Marie Giorgiani, Miss Annie Roo
ney. Miss Etta 'Walsh and Signor Napo
leon! took part.
Eugene Murphy introduced Rev. Father
Yorke to the audience, ajid after a great
ovation Father Yorke spoke In part as
follows: ' . . ,
In the past year those of you who stu
died event3 through the press noticed the
tide of pilgrimage which flowed toward
the Eternal City. It was the year of jubi
lee, the year predicted in the Testament
when men should put aside thoughts of
.earth and remember they were the chosen
sons of Zion..' Last- year, when the jubilee
was proclaimed, tens of thousands went
to the city of Rome to venerate the tombs
of, the apostles and to pay homage to
the Pope. In olden times the pilgrimage
was a. serious affair; the journey by land
and sea was beset by dangers. To-day
the pilgrims have little inconvenience to
suffer. to reach the Eternal City. On ar
riving there they are marshaled into com
panies and set forth to the great build
ing of St. Peter's. Picture for yourself, it
you can, that multitude of men and.wo
men marchlnc to that holy spot. It is
the citadel of our faith; we have read
and dreamed of it. Now- we behold that
mass of humanity before St. Peter's. That
great building and the shrine of the apos
tles are secondary in the minds of the
pilgrims. Thev look out on a palace on
the hill. It is the Vatican. They point
to the two rooms which are the apart
ments of the Pope. He is the magnet
which draws these thousands from many
lands. A poor old man of 90 years is sit
ting In those rooms, but he is proud be
cause he is the successor of him whom
Christ made the head of the Catholic
church. For twenty-five years he has
lived there. He has never passed outside
this palace. The gardens of the Vatican,
about which so much is said, are no larger
than two of our city blocks. The Pope
Is no longer seen in state; he no longer
comes out on the balcony on Easter morn
ing; he no longer rides In his carriage
through the streets, because by vicissi
tudes of things he Is a prisoner in the
Vatican.
' "People ask themselves if , he is a
prisoner of his own free will. Men ar
range themselves on two sides. One class
says that the Italian Government will not
allow the Pope to leave the Vatican; the
others say that the Italian Government
will Â¦welcome the Pope at any time if he
chooses to come out on the streets.
"The Duke of Norfolk, one of England's
great peers, recently spoke of the
restoration of- the temporal power of the
Holy See. j A scree'eh went up all over
the world and the Associated Press,
which represents all that which Is anti-
Christ, liko the Bourbons, cast slurs on
the Vicar of Christ. This Associated
Press Â¦went to the gutter sheets of Eng
land and the Continent and racked out
all the abuse they flung against the Duke
of Norfolk and gave it to tho press of
America and of this city as the represen
tative criticism of the great papers of
England and Europe. The respectable
papers did not fly in a passion over the
utterances of tho Duke of Norfolk. They
realized that the Duke's act was like the
handwriting on the wall; that the House
of Savoy had been' weighed and found
wanting."
Father Yorke then described the
growth of Rome and the power of the
Popes who lived there for many centuries
and the struggles of the early Christians,
and continuing, said:
"The Church of Rome is a society of
men. It is not. a secret society. She is
wonderfully organized and she Is Catholic
because she Is universal. . The Catholic
Chufrch is under the direction of him who.
is the successor of him appointed by Je
sus Christ. The church is a reality of
the world which must be reckoned with:
She is spread everywhere, in all lands
and among all tongues. There are divi
sions 1 and heresies in the church, but they
go to prove the unity of the church. Like
the branch which is swept from the
mountain top by the hurricane and car
ried Into. the valley to wither and die, it
but proves that there is a mighty tree
somewhere which Is rooted firmly in the
soil and can never be overthrown. The
unity of the church must ha.ve a. visible
head. Christ is the invisible head and his
representative was left to take his place.
Thc visible head of this vast organization
cannot be the subject or under thc con
trol of any particular king.
."It is often asked why the Pope does
not come out of the Vatican, and why he
does not walk abroad in the streets of
Rome. . When Pius the Ninth died and
his body was to be burled according to the
directions left in his will his body was
taken at night from the Vatican and the
procession marched across the city of
Rome to the place of burial.- The Italian
Government stirred up the people, who
pelted the hearse with stones and tried
to secure the poor body with the-inten
tion of throwing it into tho Tiber.
"Why does not the Pope come out into
the streets of Rome? I will tell you why.
If a dead Pope was not safe on Roman
streets, do you think that a live Pope
would be safe?
"When The Hajjue Peace Conference
was called, all countries were willing that
the Pope should be represented there, but
Italy objected, and to the shame of
America, this country that boasts so
often about liberty and religious freedom
joined with Italy and England and shut
the doors of the conference in the face of
the Pope. Since then the bloodiest war in
history has been waged against England,
In high house and in low house she
mourns the thousands who fell in battle
or died of sickness; not only is she
mourning the death oÂ£ her sons, but she
is scourged by just retribution' of Him in
the death of her who sat on England's
throne when the door was shut at the
peace conference In the face of the Pope.
- "When the Duke of Norfolk spoke of
the restitution of the temporal power of
the Pope, the Anglo-Saxons raised a
howl. They raised a similar howl when
the Italian troops marched into Rome and
tbe Pope became a prisoner in the Vati
can. They dared at, that time to howl
with joy that the tyranny of the Pope
was ended; when within a few miles of
them thousands of men and women In
Ireland -were starving or forced to leave
their homes for far away lands. Tho
Anglo-Saxon Is the Pharisee of the na
tions. They dare to talk of the tyranny
of the Pope when they slay the Boers,
starve women and children of the Trans
vaal, rape the women, of their enemies,
send their prisoners to the miasmatic
swamps of Ceylon or the burning rocks
of St. Helena: they dare to talk of the
tyranny of the Pope when they, are try
ing to crush a republic in South Africa
under the heels of their British cavalry. I
'.'The Pope can afford to Wait. The
eternal years of God are the years - of
Papacy. Popes have seen the birthplaces
of all nations and they will stand by the
tombs of the nations of to-day and those
to come. The rock of St. Peter Â¦. shall
stand and the Pope shall rule when the
memory of the' nations which- hold him
captive shall be as a dark dream of the
night." -â¢
