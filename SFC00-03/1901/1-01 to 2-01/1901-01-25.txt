DENVER. Jan, 24.â Fired by the ex

Mrs. Abigail Her.ry of Denver gave notice
to the local Fire and Police Board to-day
that unless a certain saloon is not shut
in two days she would wreck it. The sa
loon is known as Figaro's. It is on Down
ing avenue, between Eighteenth and Nine
teenth avenues.
"The place Is conducted by a woman,"
said Mrs. King. "She bought the saloon
from Figaro a short while ago. and im
mediately the boys of the neighborhood
began to frequent the place. If the FirÂ©
and Police Board or the truancy officers
do not remedy the evil I will follow the
example of Mrs. Nation and take the mat
ter into my own hands. I have not a great
deal of sympathy with the actions of Mrs.
Nation, but if her provocation is as great
as this I would do the same as she is do
ing. I will give two days for the officers
to wipe out this place, and if It is not
done by that time I will get a few friends
and lead an assault on the place."

says its purpose is to suppress saloons by

worried over the possibility of Mrs. Nation
coming: here. There have been several re
ports that she would be here before Ions.
The owners of ealoona have prepared
elaborate barricades for their doors and
have engaged the services of watchmen

Lord Mayor's voice was strong, and his
oratorical words were distinguishable a
block away while he read the warrant of â¢
the Privy Council to the Herald. There
upon the spectacularly-attired Herald,
bareheaded also, for the third time de
livered the proclamation. Probably no one
fifty feet away heard his words until, at
the end, he raised his voice and shouted:
"God save the King!" putting particular
stress on the words.
Crowd Cheers Feebly.
When the Lord Mayor finished reading
the warrant, with the words "His Majes
ty, King Edward VII.'* the ciowa for the
first time cheered feebly, but wlt&out uni
son, seeming to feel that too great a dis
play of enthusiasm for the King might
appear to partake of disloyalty to the
memory of thÂ© departed Queen.
It was only when the Herald shouted
"God save the King:" that the populace
responded heartily with cheers, many peo
ple echoing the shout of "God save tho
King," and waving their hats.
The Lord Mayor In the meantime pro
ceeding to the Mansion House, stepped
out on the upper balcony and aaid. In
ringing tones:
"Join in singing from the bottom of
your hearts, 'God Save the Kins.' "
The response was uncertain, for the
people present feared to undertake the
unfamiliar words until the common ser
geant (legal adviser of the corporation),
led off. whereupon hundreds joined in.
This was repeated three times, each time
hundreds more taking up the singing, un
til it became a mighty roar. Then came
more cheers for the King and Queen Con
sort, hearty but solemn, and of a vastly
different sort from the shouts heard for
Queen Victoria's jubilee. There was an
undertone of mourning.
The the Life Guards and officials from
the West End moved away and the crowd
broke up.
The city officials gathered about a table
in the Mansion House and raised their
glasses, drinking the health of King Ed
ward VII. -who had been proclaimed ac
cording to the ancient ritttal.

Black was the universal color worn by
the people. Hardly a bright bonnet or
gown relieved the sombernes of the crowd.
Soldiers and policemen formed an almost
solid lane, down Cheapside. where the pa
geant was to pass. The people behind
them, crowding for a sight over then
shoulders, were of all classes, from the
prosperous brokers to East End costers.
The mass was subdued and remarkably
orderly, an impressive contrast to the
usual London holiday crowd. The roofs of
the Exchange Bank and the Mansion
House and the windows and balconies
overlooking the scene were filled with
solid rows of people. Big policemen kept
a clear space in front of the exchange.
Enter the Lord Mayor.
At about 10 o'clock the procession, which
was disappointingly short, though gor
geous, swept down from Temple Bar at
a rapid pace and was received silently.

upon the crowds, and the Lord Mayor,

misty rain, for nearly half an hour. The
A few streets further on the proclama
tion was read again, and the procession
advanced by way of Ludgate Hill to the
Royal Exchange. The final proclamation
was made in front of the exchange. The
square before the exchange, with the
prison-like walls of the Bank of England
on one side and the massive official resi
dence of the Lord Mayor on the other,
was a stage setting whose age and solid
ity . befitted the portentous ceremony.
There were no decorations except flags,
all half-masted, save the city's red cross
on a white field over the Mansion House.
The royal standard hung above the ex-
Change and over the surrounding buslne'ss
buildings flew the union jack.
The trumpeters blew a blast, while the
Â¦wondering crowd stood bareheaded and
silent, not knowing what to do until a
military band in the procession struck up
"God save the. King."
"We with one voice, consent, tongue and
heart, pledge allegiance to King Edward
VII."
The Herald then read the proclamation,
to which the Mayor and Aldermen replied:
â¢yf 0ND0N, Jan. 24.â London to
day was given a glimpse of
medieval times. The quaint
ceremonies with which Kir.;?
j Edward \ II was proclaimed
ffÂ» rg^ at various points of the
metropolis exactly followed
ancient precedents. The offi
cials purposely arranged the function an
hour ahead of the published announce
ment and the inhabitants, when thcy
ewoke. were surprised to find the entire
way between St. James Palace and the
city lined with troops. About IOJM0 sol
diers. Life Guards, Hoise Guards. Foot
Guards and other cavalry and infantry
regiments had been brought iron Alder

All the officers had crape on their arms
and the drums and trass instruments
were shrouded in crapp. The troops in
Themselves made an imposing spectacle,
but they were entirely < closed by thÂ»
strange spectacle presented by the offi
cials of the Collece of Arms.
The ceremony began at St. James Pal
ace, where, at 9 o'clock, Edward VII was
proclaimed King of Cie United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor
of India. The proclamation, which wr*s
read by William Henrv Weldon. King at

In the Midst of Signs of
Mourning London Gets
Glimpse of Olden Times
The chief interest of the morning cen
tered in the entrance of the heralds' pro
cession into the city at Temple Bar. The
gray minarets of the Law Courts and the
tall spires of the Strand churches loomed
phantom-like out of the fog, while a long
double line of overcoated troops stood,
chilled and motionless, along the half de
serted streets." The clocks in the Law
Courts and St. Dunstan's tolled out
mournfully the* quarter hours till 9:15.
when, out of the gray mist, from within
the city boundary, appeared a procession
of carriages forming the Lord Mayor's
entourage. It was there that the two

derella-like coaches that would have been

Entrance of the Heralds.
A blare of trumpets announced the pro
gress of the cavalcade as it proceeded
through Trafalgar Square and the Strand.
The contingent from the College at
Arms was composed of three kings at
armB, four heralds and eight pursuivants.
The costumes of the two latter were
gorgeous beyond compare. They wore
tabards, a garment resembling the cos
tume of kings as "depicted on playing
cards. These tabards were beautifully
and heavily embroidered with silk lions,
the royal coat of arms, and flowers in be
wildering confusion. There was the
rouge dragon, the blue mantle and the
multravers. with all the armorial bearings
of that quaint old body, the College of

MENTO, Jan- 24.â The concurrent
resolution proposed by the Com
mittee on Federal Relations, laud
atory of the course of President
McKlnley. Secretary of State Hay and
Governor Gage In relation to the plague
scare, was held up in the Assembly thi3
morning, and finally laid over till to-mor
row. Feliz, Foster, James. Laird and
Brown objected to the resolution, because
of assertions contained in it of which
they had no knowledge other than hear
say evidence.
The Senate concurrent resolution de
manding the removal of Klnyoun was not
acted upon, pending action upon the mild
er statements of the Assembly resolution.
The committee apolnted to round up the
stenographers of the Assembly reported
that it had found six competent ap
pointees and corraled them, and that, ow
ing to the transfer of one of them to the
clerkship of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, another appointment was due. Tha
committee recommended that the chair
man of the Judiciary Committee be al
lowed to make the appointment. The rec
ommendation was adopted in spite of tha
opposition of the San Francisco delega
tion, which wanted the appointment left
with its Committee on Attaches.
A giddy whirl of Junketing trips con
fronts the Assembly, while safely laid
away on the table is Melick's resolution
providing that but three member* of a
committee shall go on such trips and that
only necessary expenses, instead of mile
age, shall be allowed.
Higby, chairman of the Fish and Game
Committee, to-day asked for leave of ab
sence for his committee from Friday until
Monday, as it wanted to visit the hatch
ery at Sisson.
Speaker Pendleton suggested that all
committees that contemplated junketing
trips should agree upon a time, so that
the Assembly might adjourn during: th-s
days of their absence.
The proposal was made that an adjourn
ment from to-morrow to Monday would
be convenient, but apparently few com
mitees are ready for their trips now, and
it is net probable that the adjournment
trill be taken to-morrow for that purpose.
The Committee on State Prisons and
Reformatories is ready for its trip *nd
will ask for leaves of absence from to
morrow till Monday, but Its itinerary Is
not yet determined.
The Public Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee is planning an extensive trip over

SENATOR ASHE'S PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATOR BILLS
Designed to Make Less Expensive
the Probating of .
Estates. : ; Â¦-' :
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â In flvo bills introduced
in the Senate by Ashe to-day provision is
made for the abolition of the well paying
position of attorney for the Public Ad
ministrator, fees are cut down generally,
and, in several ways, an attempt is made
to make it easier for a dead man's estato
to bear the burdens of probate.
The first bill provides that â¢administra
tion may be granted to one or more com
petent persons at the written request of
the person entitled, and "the force and ef
fect of the request shall not be affected
by the fact that the person entitled is a
non-resident of the State." InÂ«accordance
with this declaration, which is the form
of an amendment to section 1379 of thj
Code of Civil Procedure, section 13G9 ! of
the same code, which defines who is not
competent to administer upon estates, is
so amended by the second bill as to strike
from it the clause inhibiting administra
tion by non-residents.
The third bill so amends section 1727 of
the Code of Civil Procedure as to declare
that the Public Administrator shall not
employ counsel at the expense of Â»ny es
tate unless the court, upon a verified pe
tition setting forth the facts and the rea
son why it Is necessary that he should
have the assistance of counsel, shall al
low him to employ such counsel. It !s
further provided that the compensation of
such counsel, when employed, 6hall bo
fixed by the court and paid out of the as
sets of the estate.
The fourth bill limits this amount
which can be fixed by thÂ« court at, "not
to exceed, in any case, one half of his own
commissions," referring to the fees
charged by the Public Administrator.
In the fifth bill these fees are set
forth, making in each case a substantial
reduction in the amounts allowed by the
present sections of the code, and the bill
reduces the fees as follows:
On the first $1000 from 7 to 5 per cent;
above $1000 and under $10,000 from 5 to 4
per cent: above $10,000 and under $20,000
from 4 to 3 per cent; above $20,000 and un
der SlOOyOOO from 2 to 1 per cent, and above
$100,000 from 1 to H per cent.
The real purpose of the bills, as express
ed by Senator Ashe, is to compel the
election of an attorney to the office Â¦ ot
Public Administrator bo that he can do
his own legal work and net be allowed to
ask for a fee for himself and fees for
an a-ttorney as well.

MENTO, Jan. 24.â When the franchise bill
comes up in the Assembly for third read-
Ing to-morrow an attempt will be made to
have it amended so as to include the most
important provision of the measure drawn
by the Traction Company. This provision
would make it compulsory for a Board of
Supervisors or other municipal governing
body to grant a franchise without adver
tisement or competition to a company pre
senting a petition signed by the owners of
two-thirds of the property fronting on the
line of the proposed franchise, . and pro
viding, further, that In such cases the
amount paid to the municipality shall be

question at issue is whether or not the

that committee fail to agree, the situation
will be rather complicated. The commit

Senator Nutt introduced a bill providing
for the submission of county and munici

enactment by popular vote. The idea is
to obtain local option for cities.
Senator Belshaw introduced a bill mak
ing it punishable by death for a life term

of suggestions contained in the Governor's
message.

A resolution to add Senator Sims and
Senator Luchsinger to the committee to
make a junketing trip through the south

most effeptual opposition. Attention was
called to the fact that in making up the
committee of investigation no representa
tion from the Finance Committee had
been provided for. and Sims and Luch
singer were putVforward to fill the breach.
It was objected, however, that the Senate
would be in serious danger of being with
out a quorum during the Junket week, as
seven more members beside those going
south were booked for a trip to San Quen
tln that might take longer than was ex
pected. The argument found ready favor
and the resolution was lost.
Wolfe introduced a constitutional
amendment giving to Boards of Super

they now fix water and gas rates. It is a

Suggests Methods, to
Prevent Shirking of

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â The Senate of
the Legislature of 1889 adopted a
resolution authorizing the Lleu-
tenant Governor to appoint -a.
committee of three Senators to Investigate
the problems of State, county and munici
pal taxation and report their findings to
the Legislature of 1901- Senators S. C.
Smith of Kern. E. K. Taylor of Alameda
and J. C. Elms cf Sonoma were chosen
to make the lnQuiry. They have sub
mitted a.n elaborate report, which will be
presented In the Senate to-morrow.
The committee will report that it finds
that money, stocks, securities, etc., gener
ally escape taxation and that the chief
burden falls upon real estate.
Ample reference Is made to conditions
existing in New York, Texas and New
Hampshire, showing that the assessment
of money and credits represents but 2 per
cent of their value.
Figures relating to California are sub
mitted, which Ehow that the total assess
ment of money and solvent credits is but
M3.S47,378, yet the report of the Bank
Commissioners shows that the amount of
money in the banks due depositors is $279,
fc3\0S& 25. Â¦ . . , â¢ â¢
Referring to this evasion, the committee
says: "A plan of assessment resting upon
the solemn oath of the citizen, which
fails to reach one-fifth of the unquestion
able truth, is not one to which a Christian
people can point with much pride. For
moral reasons. If for no other, the present
system should be abandoned."
The report holds that what is true of
money ajid credits is true in a somewhat
less degree as to other kinds of personal
property.
â¢'Whether we will it or not," says the
Senators, "the country Is rapidly ap
proaching Single tax* if the present sys
iom of taxation be not abandoned or very
radicaJlv changed."
The committee finds that the present
system of taxation is extremely un
popular. Citizens in all stations of life
resist the demands of the tax-gatherer
â¢with a .deterTnlnation unapproached in any
otner affair of dollars.
"Men cheerfully give their lives and the
lives of their favorite sons to the mainte
nance of their Government but they wiil
not pay their taxes if they can avoid it,"
says the report.
A recommendation Is made as follows:
"In view of the admitted inequalities of
apFessment: In view of the great unpopu
larity of the present system; in view of
the great injustice inflicted upon a part
of the people, your committee recommends
that a radical change be made in the
present system of obtaining support for
the government and that instead of look
ing solely to taxes on property, a large
part of the burden be shifted tft business."
A etarap tax or business tax. similar to
that which the Federal Government Is
now imposing. Is suggested as a measure
to relieve real estate of undue burdens.
The committee does not hazard a bill
carrying Its recommendations into effect,
but "pimply submits the general idea. It
Is acknowledged that an attempt to lay
down the details of the plan proposed
would be to take a leap in the dark-

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO. Jan. 24.â The mem
'bers of the San Francisco dele
gation, who led yesterday in the
latest raid on the treasury by
forcing through the Republican caucu*
resolutions providing for the addition of
seven names to the list of attaches, are
grinding their teeth in rage and vowing
vengeance against the men who to-day
balked their schemes. The resolution
which Kelley, the caucus chairman, was
to have presented, providing for the ap
pointment of the new attaches, did not
come before the . Assembly, ' for the very
good reason that a portion of the Repub
lican members had agreed to vote with
the minority that it be tabled until the
majority could reconsider it in caucus.
A large number of the country members
and tho less voracious Assemblymen from
the populous districts felt outraged by
the caucus action yesterday. Most of
them went into the patronage caucus
understanding that : the proposal to
make Jacob Steppacher an "apportion
ment clerk" was the only matter to be
considered. Nearly all of them werd in
favor of this, appointment, but to bo
hoodwinked and bulldozed into, caucus
action upon numerous other additions to
an overgrown colony of attaches gave
them a feeling of . disgust that insured
their willingness to embrace uny honor
able method of escaping from a vote in
favor of the resolution for the appoint
ments in Question.
Their good humor was not Increased by
the discovery that the caucus had voted
to place four temporary appointees of the
sergeant-at-arms upon the payroll, In-
Santa Clara, who had finally been taken
into the Republican caucus. These men,
with the Democratic minority, would be
able to prevent the three-fifths aftrmatlve
vote necessary to adopt a resolution for
the appointment of additional attaches.
Kelley was told this morning at the be
ginning of the session what would be done
If his resolution were offered. After a
hasty conference with Johnson, Fisk,
Hourigan and others, Kelley offered to
include only Geary. Steppacher and Dele
hantj* in his resolution, leaving the ap
pointment of the four porters for future
consideration.^ The opposition would not
agree, and Kelley was forced to withhold
his resolution, and he announced private
ly that he would call another caucus for
this afternoon. A subsequent conference
with the leaders of the raiders, however,
caused him to change his mind and the
caucus .was not called. An attempt may
be made to-morrow morning to force- the
resolution through in the hope that the
opposition will weaken or that Demo
cratic members may be found to join the
raiders.
Had Kelley offered his resolution to-day
there would have been something doing
in the Assembly. Numerous Democratic
spellbinders were primed and ready to
level broadsides at the Republicans, who,
though ostensibly partisans of the Gov
ernor, were picking large holes in his pet
policy of economy, and that, too, during
his absence from the capital.
Franklin, Butler, Brady, Collins, Evatt
and others of the San Francisco delega
tion were wild with rage at Kelley for his
failure to introduce Â¦ the resolution, and
immediately after adjournment demanded
explanations. They in^turn had to give
an accounting to Martin Kelly, who, as
usual, was waiting In the corridor for re
ports from the beetle-brqwed statesmen
who represent him in the Assembly.

pacher to be apportionment clerk, Major
Geary to.be file clerk, and Thomas Dele
hanty to be clerk of the Committee on
Engrossment and Enrollment, made
seven proposed additions to the salary
list. â¢
The members who felt that whether or
not Assemblyman Franklin and Martin
Kelly had been feeding Thomas Dele
hanty did not concern the State, who be
lieved that the San Francisco delegation
was in no wise entitled to a special clerk,
and who believed that the entire proceed
ing was a shameless violation of the un
derstanding that the patronage list had
reached Its limit, began work last night
to stop action in the Assembly. It was*
recognized by them that if the resolution
to be offered by Kelley came to a vote
they would be compelled in honor, â¢ as
bound by the caucus, to go on record m
favor of a measure entirely obnoxious *o
them. Some of the leaders began a can
vass to determine how many would con
sent to vote to lay the resolution on the
table until time should be had for recon
sideration in caucus, which such action
would force upon the maiority.

RAMENTO. Jan. 24.â Senator Lu
kens introduced In the Senate
this afternoon three bills which
doubtless will afford the Univer
sity of California whatever financial aid
this session of the Legislature will grant
it. The first appropriates $200,000 for the
university and the other two effect the
transfer to the university maintenance
fund of the $43,000 now in the Governor s
mansion fund! .
These measures ire In direct line with
Governor Gage's policy and hi3 opinions
as to the method by which aid should be
given to the university. Moreover, the
Governor to-day expressed to the mem
bers of the Alameda County delegation
his approval of these measures and their
introduction out of order in
this afternoon was the result. Assembly
man Foster will introduce them in the
other branch of the Legislature to-mor-
r Â°In view 1 of 'the* Governor's assured ap
proval and the absence of any disposition
among members of the Senate or Assem
bly to refuse any reasonable aid to tne
university to which Governor Gage will
agiee, it Is predicted on all sides that
these bills will be passed without opposl-
Se'nate bill No. 262, the most important
of the. three, provides as follows:
Section 1. The sum of J20O.00O is hereby ap
propriated- out of atry money in the State
treasury not otherwise approprlatea for the
use and support of the University of Califor
nia, in addition to all other sums of money
provided for the support and maintenance ot
the University of California. â¢ '. -
Sec. 2. The Controller of the Stata Is au
thorized to draw ht3 warrant for the same,
payable to the order of the treasurer of the
University of California, and the Treasurer of
the State is directed to ra" the same on or
after the first day of January. A. D. 1302.
The Alameda 'County delegation cau
cused on the university question early this
afternoon and agreed that the bills here
described should be introduced. Senator
Lukens and Assemblyman Foster, in
whose districts the university is situated,
were chosen to Introduce the measures.
The fate of the Rowell bill Is uncer
tain. Of one thing there is no doubt,
any revenue derived from the sources
made use of by these measures will not
be given to the university. The tax on
naturalization and the inheritance tax
meet very little favop. The fee for in
corporation is more popular and It may be
established by law, but in such cases the
revenue it yields will go Into the general
fund. "WTille the effect will be the game,
since cash is being transfered from the
general fund to the university fund, this
plan will follow the Governor's theory
that direct appropriations should be made

FROM DYSPEPSIA AXD STOMACH
THOTJBI^E.
Instantly Relieved and Permanently
Coxed by Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets.
A New Discovery, but Not a Patent
Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
case of acute stomach trouble and chronic
dyspepsia by the use of the new discov-
ery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach.
He had pains like rheumatism in tha
back, shoulder blades and limbs, fullness
and distress after eating, poor appetita
and loss of flesh; the heart became af-
fected, causing palpitation and sleepless-
ness at nlcht.
"I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As
an experiment, I finally bought a 50-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most immediate relief was given, and af-
ter he bad used four*boxes he was to all
appearances fully cured.
"There was no more acidity or sour,
watery risings, no bloating after meala.
the appetite was vigorous and rre had
gained between ten and twelve pounds In
weight of solid healthy flesh.
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold in drug stores,
yet I consider them a most valuable ad-
dition to any physician's line of remedies,
as they are perfectly harmless and can be
given to children or invalids or in any
.condition of the stomach, with perfect
safety, beins harmless and containing
nothing but fruit and vegetable essences,
pure pepsin and Golden SeaL
"Without any question they are the
safest, most effective cure for Indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
severe."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are made by
the F. A. Stuart Co. of Marshall. Mich.,
and are sold by druggists everywhere at
50 cents per package.

LONDON, Jan. 24.â King Edward, es
corted by aÂ«quadron of the Horse Guards
and accompanied by the Duke of York,
Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holsteln,
the Duke of Saxc-Coburg and Gotha. and
others, left Marlborough House at - 11
o'clock to take the train for Osborne.
A royal salute In celebration of his Ma
jesty's accession was fired at noon In St.
James Pack. v
The crowds still thronged the streets
through which his Majesty passed and
the great cheering was in strong contrast
with the sllenco which greeted his Majes
ty's arrival In London. â¢ -
Orders havÂ« b*Â«n tasted, to tpa channel
squadron and all other available ships to
assemble at Spithead February 1, the
date of the removal of Queen Victoria's
body from Osbdrne.
It is understood that the warships will
form in double lines, through which the
royal yacht, bearing the body, x will pass.
The vagaries of an apparently harmless
lunatic occasioned some excitement at
Victoria station. During the entraining
of the King a well-dressed individual,
bearing a letter addressed to his Majesty,
waB permitted to pass the barriers. He
hurried to an equerry and said he. wished
to present the letter to the King person
(ttlly. The - man was handed over to the
police. The envelope contained only a
telegraph form, on which were the words
"I wish to see my beloved Queen."

LONDON, Jan. 25, 4:30 a. m.â It is un
derstood that the passing of the body of
the Queen through London will be an im
posing pageant and that members. of the
House of Lords and, House of Commons
will be invited to follow the procession.
At the same time there seems to be some
apprehension lest a change of destination
should omit London. .
â¢The Dally Telegraph claims for London
aright to share in the obsequies and de
clares that nothing but the deceased's
own wishes should prevent this. .

CHICAGO, Jan. 24.â "I think there is a

the prize-fight promotor to-day at the

offer Fitzsimmons something pretty good
in the way of a purse, and that, I think,

We believe that the sacrifice you have made
will help to protect that liberty of thought and
freedom of speech which are so dear to every
true scholar.
We part from you feeling our great loss and
wish it might not have been so.
In view of your departure we, students in
the History Seminary, desire to express our
appreciation of your services to us as a.. teacher
and leader.
We recognize your profound scholarship and
your great executive ability: an ability em
phasized by the thorough and complete organ
ization of the history department, by the, ease
and strength with which you have directed its
affairs, and by the frequent demands made
upon you for counsel and advice in the gen
eral management of the university.
The manner la which you have carried for
ward your work and th<; inspiration which you
have given to Â¦ your, students mark you as a
great teacher. The increasing success of your
students as teachers of history makes plain
that they have sat at the feet of a master;
and their regard for you Is excelled only by
their devotion to the truth into which you
have led them.
We admire the spirit which has led you, for
the sake of your students and the university,
to make many sacrifices. We thank you for
the generosity which has given us the unre
stricted use of your library. We are touched
by your devotion to our welfare, made evident
by keeping up your work faithfully to the
last in circumstances* which rob labor of its
zest. â¢
Our abiding: faith in you has been begotten
by your high character, by the unselfish in
terest in us which you have always shown
and by your absolute devotion to the truth.
You nave proved that a teacher may hold
close personal relations with his students with
out'any loss of his dignity and with a great
gain of their love.
We deplore the loss which the university has
sustained: but we know that youw resignation
cannot break the tlea which bind you to your
students.
The resolutions were signed by the semi
r.ary students in a body. The following
resolutions, similarly signed, were pre
sented to Professor David E. Spencer:
As you are to leave us we. students of the
Historic Seminary, desire to express our ap
preciation of you and your work. We desire
to testify to your high scholarship, your clear
ness of view, your accuracy of statement and
your thoroughness. We acknowledge the high
ideals of work which our association with you
has given us.
We deplore the unfortunate circumstances
which have led you to leave us.
We honor you for the nobility of character
which has made you give up your position for
what you believed to b? the right.

Special Dlapatcfh to The Call.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
>TETV YORK, Jan. 24.â Nikola Tesla has
at last perfected his new svstem of elec
tric lighting-daylight illumination, it may
be called, and he hopes to soon have it
Introduced Into general use. Under a full
head of electricity the lamp has the color
of Ice in the sun. The light Is soft and
absolutely steady. So diffuse Is It that
it deceives the eye and at first seems with
out much power of Illumination.
This is the lightâ "the perfect sanitary"
light â as Tesla calls it; for which he has
been seeking. There are neither wires
nor carbon filament to break or burn out.
The lamp may be described as a nest of
glass tubes,' bent in rectangular form.
Each lamp has about twenty feet of white
flaming tubes. Into this' square coil of
hollow glass, of the diameter of one's
finger, electricity Is sent quivering from
Tesla's oscillator. Bursting into light, it
floods the apartment with the clear light
of day. It is daylight-Â»-not the splendor
of the sun, but light of the sun, as on a
cloudy day, when one forgets that the sun
is shining. When a Call reporter saw the
little white, icy tubes shining along the
ceiling of Tesla's laboratory they ap
peared no more responsible for daylight
in the room than the glass pendants of a
chandelier. In a far corner an ordinary
incandescent bulb was glowing. It was
extinguished, but the daylight remained.
When Tesla's icy tubes were extinguished
the place was in total darkness.-

Schooner Barbara Hernster
Strikes and One Sea
man Perishes.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
POINT ARENA, Jan. 24.â Driven by a strong north wind, the gasoline
schooner Barbara Hernster crashed upon the rocks Just below Point
Arena at 6 o'clock this evening. One member of the crew, Frank Chris
tensen. lost his life through the capsizing of a small boat while the
crew was coming ashore from the wrecked vessel. The Barbara Hern
ster is In a dangerous, position and the prevalence of a half gale makes the
chance for her rescue exceedingly slight.
The Barbara Hernster had taken on a cargo of 125 tons of wood for H. A.
Richardson and left her moorings at the wharf for the run to San. Francisco.
The wind proved to be so strong that she was unable to tack out to sea, and
within a short time after her lines .had been cast off she was on- the rocks
Just below the point. The small boats were launched and the captain and
crew started for the shore. Before they had- proceeded far a wave capsized
one of the boats, which contained Christensen and another seamani Chrlsten
sen was drowned, but a line was got to the other seaman and he was picked
up. The rest of the crew reached shore In safety.
The loss of the Barbara Hernster adde another argument In favor of pro
viding a life-saving station at the point. Christensen lost his life within a few
yards of the spot where it is proposed to establish the station, and had a
life-saving crew been present he could easily have been saved.
The Barbara Hernster is of 148 gross tonnage. She! was built in 1S87 at
Fairhaven, Cal., and is owned by L. Hackley of San Francisco.

FORT DE FRAXCE. Island of Martin
ique. Jan. 24. via Haytlen cable.â The at
titude of the Government of Venezuela
toward the Bermudese Asphalt Company
(American) is hostile for the reason that
the concessions recently accorded by the
Government have been given to people in
touch with the Government and who
would like to resell them to the Bermudeso
Company. The Government, having re
fused to accede to the reauest of the
American Minister, who demanded a sus
pension of action on the part of the new
concessionaires in taking possession * of
their grants, strained relations between
Venezuela and the United States resulted
and war vessels are expected to return to
La Guayara. If the Venezuelan Govern
ment employs force to take -ossession of
the asphalt lake It is believed the United
States cruiser Scorpion will land an
armed force.
The attitude of Venezuela toward
Americans may be described as hostile.
On the 15th of this mouth the Venezuelan
troops in the barracks at Caracas muti
nied and killed their colonel, the lieuten
ant colonel and several men, and then fled
in various directions, 210 of the men being
ca.ptured. There was no fighting In th">
town. The exact causo of the mutiny Is
not known.
No accurate details are obtainable re
garding the sinking of the British sloop
jiarla Teresa by the Venezuelan gunboat
Miranda. s- â¢
It Is supposed the Maria Tereea was on
her way from the British island to Trin
idad with a cargo of arms Intended for the
Venezulean revolutionists and that she
was met by the Miranda, who, wishing to
take possession of her, fired on the Mar'.a
Teresa, and by so doing set her on lire,
after which she sank. In the east the
insurrection appears to be localized be
tween Cumana and the extreme northeast
of Venezuela. The insurgents have taken
possession of Cerupano and during the
evening of January 21 there -was a tenta
tive uprising in the north of Barcelona.
Calm prevails in the west, but a number
of arrests were belne made and revolu
! tionists appear to be concentrating at
! Curacao.
The situation so far as it affects the
Bermudez Aspnalt Company grows more
critical every bour. All the negroes and
other laborers are menaced and impressed
by the local authorities, or they desert,
thus leaving the plants at the asphalt
lake without assistance.
The American colony In Venezuela con
tinues to protest against the indifference
with which American lives and interests
are regarded. â¢

been seen before on the rails o'er which
it came. Apparently it had never been
used before and was entirely In white,
both the exterior ar.d the interior.
The party returned to the Van Nuys,
where they were assigned to rooms. The
Ihike was but half through his dinner in
the Van Xuys Cafe when the card of The
Call representative was taken to him. He
did not follow the ufual custom of those
in the public eye ar.d send out word for
the reporter to "wait an hour or two. The
rhike left his cold bottle and hot bird and
Immediately went to the parlor, where
he graciously submitted to an interview
end courteously showed no Impatience, al
though h:s dinner was waltinr. He chatted
pleasantly of the days whenCS was a re
porter m New York and told of having
interviewed Carnegie.
"I Irked the work very much Indeed."
he declared. "Your American reporters
have been most assiduously present
wherever I have been ever since we land
c<i. Only forty-e'.ght met us when we
came out cf quarantine at Xew York. I
talked to seventy-six In two days. Twenty
'jÂ«ed to come every day and I wrote bulle
tins for them. Just as though I were seri
ously 111. They have been in evidence all
the way across the continent and have
dropped upon us from all sorts of unex
pected places. â¢
"Do I like California? Tes. Indeed!

owr.f<! a ranch near San Galbriel and I
*pent jiine months there with him. Los
Angeles Is muA Improved since I was
here two years ago. How different it is
now"â he was evidently thinking of the
Duchess, for he continued, "We have had
a very happy wedding Journey. It was
nice even coming throurh the desert Our
hair was filled with alkali dust, which
covered everything- In the car, but we did
not ralnd that,"
Â¦ Here he gave a happy laugh. "No. we
are not going to the theater to-n!ght. We
rannot take any pleasure on account of
th<Â» Queen's death. We leave for the
north at 11 o'clock to-morrow. We will
spend some time In San Francisco, and
Â¦will then po to Monterey, where we will
f=tay for two days, and I will play golf.
I began to play golf only last September.
I usually piay more violent games, such

THE SAN FRANCISCO,; CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 25, 1901.
Queen will take place at Windsor Castle.
February 2. The body of the late Queen
will be removed from Osborne House
February L It was the expressed desire
) of the Queen that the funeral should be
' military In character. Several officials ar-
I rived from Osborne to-day, bringing the
j state regalia.
So hampered have been the arrange
ments at Osborne House that the body of
Queen Victoria still lies in the bedroom
where she died. The elaborate decora
tions necessary In turning the dlningr
room In Osborne House Into a chapel ar
dente occupied bo much time that al
though the royal household waited hour
I after hour for the first private service It
was found Impossible to hold this yester
day. Â¦Â¦â¢'-"Z'"':
It is hoped, however, the function will
be performed this (Friday) morning by
the Bishop of Winchester, In the presence
of King Edward, Emperor William and
almost every member of the royal family:
The coffin was brought to Osborne House
last evening 'and was taken through the
Queen's private gate, which had not been
previously > used since her death. Em
peror William was the first person to see
It. The coffined body will be transferred
this morning to the dining-room, now
hung with deep purple. The dais is
wreathed with the royal standard and on
each side are grea; candles. Madonnas
by famous painters hang on the draped
walls. In one corner magnificent wreaths
from all parts of the world crush their
blossoms against each other. Among these
the most beautiful are from Emperor
William and Empress Augusta Victoria,
Around the coffin chairs are arranged for
the royal mourners.
Lord Pelham Clinton authorizes the
statement that there will be no lying in Â¦
state. However, there is good reason to
expect that many persons will be afford
ed the privilege of seeing their dead i
Queen as she lies In the * gorg-eously
trimmed dining-room, where she will re
main until February L In the expecta
tion that this will be the case people are
already pouring Into Cowes. If. they are
disappointed In this respect they/ will at
any rate be rewarded by witnessing a
great naval display.
Yesterday King Edward replied to thou
sands of messages he has received. To
those from rulers and great-- personages
he replied in person, To those from, minor

Pending this act, George Dufbrow of
the Standard Salt Company la said to
have gone to Salton with a force of men
and squatted upon the land hitherto
worked by the Liverpool company, with a
view of claiming It as soon as thÂ«Â» Presi
dent has signed the saline bill. The Liv
erpool company Is said to have made
preparations for the defense of its prop
erty. It is feared th*re will be a collision
between the forces of the rival claimants,
and bloodshed is probable.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 24.â Serious trou
ble Is brewing between the Standard Salt
Company and rtie Liverpool Salt Com
pany. The plant of the latter Is situated
at Salton. on the Mojave desert, and it
was recently alleged that ita supply of
salt was being taken from Government
land, to which the company had no legal
title. A bill has just been passed by Con
gress extending the operation of the min
eral laws to saline lands and providing
the method by which they may be "patent

He came back at me and I let him have
it again. : The next thins 1 knew he was
lying In front of 'me. together with the
stove. whicJf he had brought down in hia

told him the etove had fallen over, and ha
grinned. I was pretty well played out,
and Blakeman looked like an active

the Receiving Hospital. He said I had
dislocated his shoulder, and I went to
Judge Hebbard's court, where I had a
case. I'd do the same thing again under
the same circumstances."

Weather Prophet McAdie of the local
Weather Bureau gives an interesting ex
planation for the alleged phenomenon. In
an interview he said: ,
"The obscuration this morning was
caused by a sudden change of wind in
San Francisco. In the early hours of the
morning we had a fog that lasted until
about 10 o'clock. Then we had very light
surface southerly winds. The cloud of
smokeâ the genuine article generated in
this cityâ blew westward and drifted out
to 6ea. There came a sudden bulging of
the pressure from the north and it was
felt frem Cape Mendoclno to Cape Blanco.
The pressure arose very rapidly and the
result was a very strong indraft, of air
from the north and also from the west.
The western wind brought In the fog, the
vanguard of the bank of fog that was out
side. This fog entrapped the smoke and
we got our own smoke back two or three
hours later. The darkness lasted fifteen
minutes during the transit of the fog and
smoke over the city. The people in the
Western Addition experienced the sur
prise at 10:20 a. m. and the downtown dis
tricts were compelled to turn on electric
lights at 10:40 a. m." *-

nicipality was going into mourning for
the death of the Queen. Othere were of
the opinion that the gas companies had
assumed control of the sun and turned
oft* the light for the purpose of advancing
the price of their stock.
The man who swore that he taw a flock
of quail or prairie chickens pass over the
high buildings went home and told his
wife that he was going on the trail of
the birds with a double-barreled shotgun.
Ship masters threw out extra lines and
took in sail and awaited the coming of a
heavy wind. The attaches of the Weather
Bureau were soon made aware that this
city contained, many curious people. For
two hours the telephone bell drowned the
din of the telegraph Instruments and the
wire was hot with inquiries for the cause
of the sudden gloom. A bright youth was
stationed at the phone and droned out
that it was nothing but fog and smoke.
Within five minutes the obscuration
passed and old Sol refuted the idfe slan
der that he had become the property of
corporations. He shone with .renewed
splendor and every one guvÂ© a sigh of

Some time ago .Blakeman, who was act
ing as attorney for Mrs. Bell, moved for
a new trial of his client's -case against
Lucius Solomon, for whom Tauzsky was
attorney and who won his suit. The mo
tion for a new trial was denied, and
Blakeman's bill of exceptions was settled
During the course of the trial Blakeman
had taken an exception to a ruling of the
court admitting in evidence some impor

omitted to . - note it. -Blakeman asked
Judge Seawell for permission to insert
it, but the court held that the proper
time for such a course had passed and
refused to allow the change in the record.
Yesterday morning the attorneys met in
the Judge's chambers to settle the bill of
exceptions. Judge Seawell's watchful eye
discerned the ostracized exception among
the others. Attorney Tauszky also told
the court of its presence, and Judge Sea

take such unwarrantable action. Blake

Track Notes.
The followers of Winnie O'Connor, the
New York rider, had nothing but money at
the conclusion of the racing at Tanforan
Park yesterday. Long shots in. the betting
practically swept everything before
them and Winnie contributed his share by
landing first at the wire on Boundlee,
quoted at 15, and also Wyoming, another
15 to 1 chance at one 3tng;e of the betting.
O'Connor had the honor as well of pilot-
Ing the only successful favorite in Pat
Dunne's Silurian. The other winners were
Theory, at 7 to 1. ridden by Bullman;
Advance Guard. 2 to 1, and Florinel, a 12
to 1 outsider, that scampered home with
Mounce up in the final event.
â¢ As 'the track was otill heavy and slow
this fact, it. was thousht, so militated
against the chances of Theory that in the
betting on the opening sprint her price
went to 9 to 1. Tutluli. with Tommy
Burns up, was , considered the "real
thing," going to the post a 11 to 5 favorite.
The choice broke away first, but Theory
almost immediately went to the front and,
only galloping, won easily. Tuthill did
not seem at hi<* best, for Magrane's horse
lost the place to Ada N. Anjou came very
fast from behind and looked to have fin
ished third. '
And it was the condition of the track
that sent Greenock to the post favorite
over Advance Guard for the mile and a
sixteenth purse. In the morning the latter
horse breezed through the stretch in twen
ty-five seconds, which looked good enough,
and his odds were playea from a to 3 to 2.
For a time during the running it seemed
as if Greenock would score. Then J. Mil
ler made a sweeping turn into the stretch
and in a drive to the wire Burns got
Guard over the line first by half a length.
Montanic bolted with O'Connor as the
barrier was released, being practically
left.
Pat Dunne took the three-year-old run
at seven furlongs with Silurian. Only
moderately backed at 4 to &. the brown
gelding passed Rio de Altar at will and
was not extended to lead out Bernota by
three lengths.
One of the biggest plunges of the after
noon was made on Jerid, which was at
one time backed down to 3 to -2 favorit
ism, for the fourth number. Leading to
the stretch, the chestnut there blew up.
running back among the "also rans." By
some excellent Â¦ saddle work O'Connor
forged to the front with Boundlee, down
ing Astor less than a length. Sybaris ran
into the show.
Vesuvian gave another demonstration of
his dislike* for a slow track In the mile
purse run. The Jennings entry had first
call in the betting at odds of 3 to 5. and,
always in trouble, finished thtrd. Coburn
made all the running with Vulcaln, only
to be collared near the paddock by Wy
oming and beaten a neck.
Sad Sam closed favorite for the last race
of the day, a six-furlong selling affair,
with a field of eleven going to the post.
Sam led until well into the stretch, when
he closed up like a jackknife. and Flori
nel, with Mounce In the saddle, finished
first by two lengths.

FROM EAST HERE
LEGISLATURE TAKES UP
SAN QUENTIN SCANDAL
Committee Appointed to Assist
Prison Directors in Getting
at Bottom of Trouble.
The State Legislature is going to make
an attempt to get at the bottom of the
scandal connected with the management
of the State penitentiary at San Quentln.
The efforts of the Prison Directors to place
the responsibility for the wrongdoings of
AValden, the absconding clerk of the Jute
mills, upon the shoulders of those who
should carry the burden will have the as
sistance of the Legislative members ap
pointed to conduct an investigation on en
tirely new lines. Expert MacLaren, who
was appointed by the Prison Directors to
examine the prison books, says that ow
ing to the disapearance of the records
previous to 1S96 he is unable to make a
report showing how far the Jute mill has
been used as a source of profit to the
clique engaged in robbing the State The
Legislative Investigating committee has
power to summon witnesses, and among
those first subpenaed will be the officers
of the steamer Caroline. The steamer
plies between this city and the prison and
carries^ the output of the jute mills. The
officers will be asked to produce their
books and show just what freight has
been brought to this port. The shipping
receipts will be compared with the records
of the prison factory and in this way it
may be possible to obtain a side light on
the crookedness of Walden and his con
federates. It Is believed that the books
of the steamer may show the shipments
of goods that were never entered on the
prison books.
Director Daniel E. Hayes, who returned
yesterday from a business trip to the
southern part of the State, says that he
can hardly realize that 'Walden has
robbed the State. "To show you what
confidence I placed in him," said Hayes.
"I will Inform you that when I heard of
the death of Clerk Ellis I said that Wal
den was the man for the vacant place
During my nine years' service as a Prison
Director I became well acquainted with
Walden and, notwithstanding the fact
that I knew he was a convict before hÂ©
was appointed to the place in the Jute
mill, I felt so certain that. he was honest
ly endeavoring to live down his past that
I would have trusted him with my life"
TO HONOR DEAD
HELP THE NEEDY
Rev. Mr. Lion Opposed to the
Expenditure of Money
for Tombstones.
The Episcopal convention of the dloce^
of California has been marked each day
by startling speeches from the clerical del
egates present, and yesterday was no ex
ception to the rule. The morning session
of the convention was devoted to the
reading of the report of the committee
on charity and a discussion of the same.
Rev. Â«E. J. Lion commented on the lack
of funds to carry out the wishes of tha
various bodies in charge of the charitlej,
and said in part:
"Building monuments to perpetuate the
memory of the departed helps no one save
the stonemason. Wo can better keep
alive the memory of the dead by helping
the living."
The report of the committee on chari
ties dealt with St. Luke's Hospital, the
Maria Kip Orphanage, the Armitage Or
phanage, the Old Ladies' Home and
otner institutions.
Major Hooper of the executive commit
tee in charge of St. Luke's Hospital re
ported that the new buildings would be
ready in about two years and that the
expense would be $50,000.
Bishop Nichols In speaking of the char
ity work of the church dwelt on the good
work done by the hospital and other in
stitutions.
A resolution proposed by Major Hooper
that the convention was enthusiastic over
the general convention to be held here
next October and that a telegram be sent
to the secretary of the general conven
tion that a warm welcome awaits the del
egates from the East when they come to
San Francisco was also adopted.
Considerable time was taken up in
electing clerical and lay delegates to trie
general convention to- be held in this city
in October.
Four ballots were taken before the final
result was announced, as follows:
Clerical delegatesâ Rev. P. W. Claiapett,
Rev. J. A. Emery. Rev. R. C B*oute and Rev.
Robert Ritchie.
Lty delegatesâ Messrs. A. N. Drown, Major
W. B. Hooper, Vincent Neale and W. A. M.
Van Bokkelen.
The alternate delegates elected w
as follows:
Rev. J. Bakewell, Rer. E. J. Lion, Rev. E.
L. Parsons, Rev. W. M. Rellly. Messrs. Fran
cis Hope, G. K. Butler, George H. Hooke. G.
11. KellcgB.
This closed the main business of thÂ«
gathering and the convention adjourned
sine die.
In the evening: a united service was held
In Grace Church in the Interest of ths
Brotherhood of St. Andrew and ths
Daughters of the King. Bishop Nichols
conducted the service and paid a tribute
to the late Queen of England and com
mented on the fact lhat two notable
women had occupied the throne of Eng
landâElizabeth and Victoria.
Mrs. Martin D. Wilson delivered an ad
dress on "The Ideal Life of a Daughter."
Dr. George S. Baker spoke on the
"Brotherhood of St. Andrew" and out
lined its mission.
Dr. Mary B. Fletcher addressed tho
congregation on "The Convention of the
King's Daughters" to be held next Oc
tober in San Francisco and told of the
efforts made at Eastern conventions to se
cure the gathering for this city. .
Ralph C. Daniels delivered a masterly
address on "L/oyalty" and by a careful
analysis showed that loyalty to the church
consisted of sympathy, support of . . tho
clergy and zealous inspiration.
This morning the Woman's Auxiliary
will hold its semi-annual meeting at St.
Paul's at 10 o'clock. Bishop Nichols will
preside.
Officer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children was
notified of the case yesterday morning
and he consulted Lieutenant French
of the Salvation Army, who agreed to
take care of the self-confessed bigamist
till she was in a more settled frame of
mind. Yesterday afternoon she was
taken to the Rescue Home of the army in
Oakland. The police could not take any
action In detaining her as no complaint
had been made against her.
Judge de Haven Sjrsaks His
Mind to the Customs
Officials.
The big black cloud that overspread the
sky and darkened the city as with a solar
eclipse yesterday afternoon was an elec
tric arc light in comparison with the black
cloud of offended Justice that settled down
In the United States District Court room
at 10 o'clock when Judge de Haven took
his seat on the bench. He had Issued
three warrants of habeas corpus on the
previous day commanding W. H. Avery,
general agent of the Oriental Steamship
Company, to produce in court at 10 o'clock
yesterday morning the bodies of Lee Nln,
Dong Cliee and Lin Quai, whose attorneys
had alleged for them that they were be
ing unlawfully restrained of their liberty
by the company. The Chinamen were
.not present and Judge de Haven there
upon spoke his mind. He remarked in his
usual impressive manner that the pro
cesses of the court must be obeyed and
that persons setting them at naught
would be severely punished.
The court thereupon ordered the united
States Marshal to go to the steamship
company's dock ana arrest the Chinese
and bring them into court and to notify
Mr. Avery to appear at 11 o'clock and
show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt. Mr. Avery appeared
later and explained that the customs in
si>ectors having in charge the Chinese had
refused to let him take them away until
thp ir baggage had been searched for duti
able articles. Judge de Haven thereupon
said that no one, whether customs official
or otherwise, had a right to interfere with
the orders of the court and that if such a
practice were to be persisted In the offend
ers would be punished rigorously. Fin
ally, when the Chinese, who claim admis
sion to this country on the ground of be
ing native born Americans, were brought
Into court the examination of the case
was set for this morning at 9 o'clock.
had been recognized and that her crime
was known, she fled from Santa Cruz that
night and came to this city. Since then
she has been endeavoring to obtain a sit
uation here without success. A few days
ago while walking along Market street
she recognized the Sheriff of Madera
County and the thought flashed into her
mind that he had come here to arrest her
for bigamy. Then the thought of suicide
came Into her head and finally she gave
herself up to the police.

SELF-CONFESSED WOMAN BIGAMIST. FRENZIED BY THOUGHTS OF
HER CRIME, AS WAfi EUGENE ARAM BY THOSE OF HIS TERRIBLE
DEED. SHE SEEKS ARREST.
"Xed" Harris, who conducts a dothiruj
Btcre at CS Kearny fcireet, was the vic
tim of two clever crooks last night.
Harris" store is within the shadow of
the Hall of Justice, but this did not deter
the thieves from plying their vocation.
Shortly after 7 o'clock two men visited
Harris' place and after introducing them
selves as employes of the Southern Pa
c:f.c Company said thev were anxious to
buy two suits of clothes. One of the men
QaaSy selected a suit which he thought
Â¦was "just the thing:." as he expressed it.
"tt'hi'e he was trying on the clothes he
suddenly discovered that he had left hi<
jjocketbbok at home and, turning: to tlie
proprietor, requested mm to lay aside tl:.*
euit. saying- he would return in about an
hour and pay for it.
He and his companion then left tha
Ftore. A few minutes iater Harris dis
covered that twelve pairs of trousers wera
missir.p. Without waiting to put on his
hat Harris rushed to police headquarters.
brA reported his loss, giving a description
of the aileged thieves. Chief Sullivan at
r-r.c* detailed two of his men to find the
crooks, but beyond Itornins that after
leaving: the store the*- ran down Clay
â¢ireet they failed to set a trace of them.

BOLD THIEVES
MAKE A HAUL
HAUNTED by the f>a.r that every
policeman ehÂ« met knew that she
was a biETair.'st and wouM place
her under arrest. Mrs. Lizzie Let
wilder wer.t to the water front
TCX"ne<day momlns with the Intention of
throTrtr.g herself !r.to the bay. Then the
thought of her mother In Davenport
Io-*:a. and the eufterirps her suicide would
cause the old lady r-.ade her change her
mind. That night she went to the Seven
teenth-street Police Station and told Lleu
tera-* \rdereon of her fears, which, she
saUL' almost drove her insane. The lieu
tenant sent her to the City Prison till
eomethir.? could be Â£or.e in her case.
Mrs. Letw-ilder Is 25 years of age. She
eayE she was born in Davenport. Iowa,
â¢where her mother. Mrs. Quistorf, still re-
Bides. When she was IS years of age she
was" married at Muscatlne, Iowa, on
September 23, 1S33, to Cyrus Letwilder.
\ciio turned out to be a. drunkard, and six
cooths after the marriage she left him
end came to this State, finally locating in
Berneda, Madera County, where she got
empioyment with a family named Brown.
6he did not correspond with her family
end vas looked upon as a single â¢woman.
Four years ago she met Jerry O'Meara, a
email farmer, near Berneda, and after a
courtship of six months they were mar
ried, she says.
Mrs. Letv.ilder lived happily with
O'Mcara for a time and then the thought
that she was not legally his wife began to
prey upon her mind and eix months ago
FhÂ«" lett him and went to Santa Cruz,
â¢where ehe obtained employment. Two
weeks ago she passed a friend from Ber

Mayor Phelan says "the Civil Service
Commissioners have labored hard and con
scientiously, with the single purpose of
establishing, the merit system under the
new charter." Nevertheless the Mayor's
Board of Health has seen fit to discharge
the present staff of physicians, under
whose regime the Receiving Hospital, in
stead of being a place of graft and tor
ture, has become a model of Its kind. The
new staff will meet this morning to re
ceive instructions, political and otherwise.
Without preliminary warning all the
physicians connected with the Emergency
Hospital except Dr, Bunnell, the chief
emergency surgeon, were dismissed by
resolution a few nights ago. Those who
have had business with the Receiving
Hospitals know that no better nor more
conscientious staff of physicians was ever
gathered in these places, either at the
harbor front or main hospital at the City
Hall.
Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi the night the de
capitating resolution went through the
Board of Health was appointed autopsy
physician, a tribute at least to his abil
ity. The other doctors, F. R, Dray, F. B.
Robinson, F. R. Starr and V. E. Putnam,
received their dismissals without the least
preliminary warning. As experience counts
In medicine as in all things, the "Lord"
Mayor's application of the merit system
for the benefit of the public service seem3
to have received a severe jolt.
Dr. Morrison is credited to Mayor Phe
lan. Dr. von der Lelth, who is credited to
Dr. Baum. had an experience one night at
the Harbor Hospital that demanded an
investigation. He was not for very long
afterward an attache of that hospital.
Dr. Armistead is credited to the influence
of Dr. Williamson. He has heretofore
done good work, and probably the merit
system was evokea in his aid.
The "Lord" Mayor's own medical col
lege will meet this morning at the
Receiving Hospital for instruction' in
their future duties, both political
and surgical. Dr. Bunnell will be the
dean, and mayhap the "Lord" Mayor will
grace the matriculating class with his
presence and deliver an address. Members
of the Board of Health are also expected
to unite in the love feast which will fol
low the conclusion of the exercises. The
collation may be served in the cellar ad
jacent to the hospital.
The class of 02 consists of six members
in advanced standing, selected it is alleged
for political merit service methods. Each
one has a distinctive pull and will con
tribute a feature to the morning's exer
cises.
"Roller Bandages" Is the topic asslgfned
to Dr. James Malaby. He will Illustrate
what Is known as the "military spinning
top," and a bolt of fine silk may be un
wound from his body, a la Custom-house
style. This feature is expected to be both
Instructive, amusing and interesting. Drs.
Armistead and Murphy are also down for
special features. Others on the "demerit
system" may be delivered by some of the
about to be retired physicians, the special
topic selected being "Why Does the Ax
Fall?"
This love feast Is scheduled for 11 a. m.,
and each of the matriculants Is ex
pected to be on hand promptly at the
appointed hour. The invitations contain
the mystic letters "P. B. R.," which In
surprise party ethics have a distinctive
meaning. Owing to the limited accommo
dations of the reception-rooms at the Re
ceiving Hospital and the necessity for
personal, private explanations, the public
has not been Invited to the symposium.
Dr. C. D. McGettieran, one of the six
emergency surgeons appointed by the
board under Its '-recent order, yesterday
tendered his resignation, giving as a rea
son that hl9 private practice required all
his time. This leaves one more place open.
Phelan's Favorites Will Be Told How
to Hold Jobs â Dr. McGettigan

A CHANCE TO SMTLE.
THE UTILITY OF BOSS CROI<ER.
rRAMv MOSS, ?. citizen of New York, who has
been conspicuous in every reform movement in
that city for many a year past, recently told a
church meeting that Croker's personality is one oJ
the best things in the metropolis. By way of proving
the assertion he added: "Without one man standing
as the representative par excellence of every evil prin
ciple in public life we should never rise to the stan
dard of citizenship or be spurred to the height oi
patriotism which alone can bring about the highest
&ood in any community."'
It is always well to have in a community a cheerful
optimist like that â one who sees good in everything
Â£.nd can draw moral lessons from such a boss as
Croker as easily as the boss himself can draw tribute
from vice. Unfortunately there is such a thing as
being too optimistic, and this happens to be one of
the instances. So far as heard from Croker has not
yet spurred anybody in New York to the height of
patriotism, while he has led many to political degra
dation.
From evil men the Jesuits are evil. Even the indig
nation which Croker arouses in New York does not
materially benefit the city or even the persons who
feel it. It has led to forty different kinds of move
ments for reform, but it has not yet led to any actual
reform. The indignation vents itself in speeches at
mass-meetings, and there is the end of it. Meantime
the base influence and power of the man continue to
dominate the community and to corrupt its politics.
Boss Croker has his uses, of course, for he would
not be in power nor would he have acquired wealth
unless he had been useful to a considerable number of
people, but it has not been the kind of utility that
Mr. Moss deems it. The standard "of patriotism
which the boss has inculcated in New York is noth
ing to brag of. In fact, it is the standard which has
made New York a reproach to American local gov
ernment, and the sooner it can be set aside in favor
cf a better a*nd a higher standard the better it will
t>e for all.

NEW YORK, Jan. 24â The following
CAXIFORNIANS IN NEW YORK.
Possibly the Venezuelans are wrong in trying to
oust the trust, but, the chances are they have at least
a showing of right. ' At any rate the contest is that
of one American company against another, so we are
bound to win whatever the result may be. In the
meantime it would net be a bad, thing for the Gov
ernment to make the affair so costly to all, concerned
that the capitalists of both corporations would con
clude^n the end that it would be better hereafte-.tc
use their money and their energies in exploiting the
resources of their own country instead of going
abroad for investments.
Of course our Government can be counted, on to
act with justice to all concerned, but in determining
what are the merits of the contending parties our
diplomatists will have to investigate the whole im
broglio, and in doing so they are apt to learn a
good deal about the way in which trusts carry on
business.
The asphalt controversy is a struggle between rival
corporations to get control of the rich asphalt de
posits of Venezuela and exploit them for" American
uses. It appears that in 1883 the Venezuelan Gov
ernment granted to s man named Hamilton a con
cession to export wood, spices, etc., from the state of
Bermudez, and also gave him a right to exploit the
asphalt deposits of the state. The concession was
transferred to the corporation now known as the
asphalt trust. Some time later the trust acquired a
concession which had been granted to a man named
Carner in 1888, which included title to a certain tract
of land containing several pitch lakes, near the town
cf Gariquien. In 1807 a corporation of Venezuelans
obtained from the Government certain mining rights
in the same district. That concession was transferred
to an American corporation, so that the trust found
an enterprising rival encroaching upon what it deemed
its monopoly. Recourse w;as had to the Venezuelan
courts and decision was given against the trust,
whereupon the trust determined to resist the Ven
ezuelan Government, and the result has been the
trouble which has led our Government to interfere.
OUT of the troubles over. the asphalt industry
in Venezuela we are not likely to get war,
notwithstanding we have three war vessels
there; neither are we likely to get glory whether we
have war or not, for Venezuela is not in our fighting
class, but we are likely to acquire something of wis
dom in dealing with trust problems.

PERSONAL MENTION.
It all means that he regards himself as a great
public necessity and is of the opinion that the coun
try will languish and fade away unless he is made
President. He is entirely unaware that the best in
fluences in his party are more than mildly disgusted
with him. The Chicago Chronicle, one of the ablest
party papers, declares that Bryan's ideas are reflected
only by the "hired men" around the committee head
quarters, who "profess great surprise that anybody
not a Populist or a tocialist should presume to in
timate that the present management of the Democratic
party can be improved upon. Of course if the ser
vants of the house are to direcf its management wÂ»
may look for no change in its affairs.; The hired
men at Democratic headquarters of late have not been
Democrats, nor have they represented Democrats.
They have embraced alKthe isms, from Populism to
anarchism. They have come from the far West and
the far South. They have had as associates from the
North and East a few socialists and other dreamers
and schemers, but it is literally true that Northern
Democrats and Northern Democratic ideas have had
no place in 4 the headquarters of a party which finds
three-fourths of its voters in the, Northern States"
All that is true, and it explains Bryan's posing.
He has effected a party organization that exults and
When all other means fail he may visit the Sphinx
and the pyramids, and with pot and brush inscribe
himself there.
He announces now that he is going abroad to meet
President Kruger. The old gentleman is in a position
to be useful as a sandwich-man, and Bryan will not
let him escape.
He is the best advertiser of himself that has ap
peared in this country. He knows to a nicety just how
to use events as a curtain on which to display him
self. For this purpose he used the death of Victoria,
uttering some dull commonplaces and wiring them
to the country. We may expect to get his opinion
of the new King of England, for he really takes him
self seriously, and seems to think that people hold in
abeyance their formation of an opinion until they h'ear
from him.
His weekly paper has been in the press dispatches
and photographed on films and wet plates and dry,
in all its stages. If he went to the imposing stone. to
inspect the forms it was with an Associated Press
agent on one side and a photographer in front. If he
touched the sheep shank and mallet he let the world
know it, per wire. When his paper was put to p-ess
he tried to feed the white sheets of print, and p-e
scnted copies to all present, verified with his signa
ture. Nothing is wired about the contents of the
paper, which are probably of the same style as his
tiresome speeches, and it is evident that he values the
rewspaper project solely as a means of getting that
public notice which is necessary to his excessive
vanity.
ADVERTISING BRYAN.
:
I J HEN EVER Bryan has changed his vocation
\ A / or made a public appearance he has had in
y Â¦ view the presence of the camera., His farming
operations were carried on before the lens, and when
he stood forth in all the brazen glory of a colonel's
uniform he bravely faced the man behind the camera.
It made no difference that he knew nothing about
farming, and nothing about regimental tactics, and
that he learned neither. The chance to pose was the
one thing desirable.
(~~* EXATOR YESi, who represents an inland
State where navigation is carried on in farm
* â wagons, has risen in his place to denounce the
oil! which :s intended to restore American maritime
supremacy.
Senator Vest is a great speechmaker. He is hardly
second to Bryan in that respect. But he producer
nothing hut speeches, and they do not swelfr our ex
port trade. The last great speech he made was in the
session of 1893, when he brought what his admirers
call his "rare powers*' to bear in denouncing Cleve
land, the gold standard 2nd sound money. In that he
(iramaticaily informed the administration that he and
it had reached "the parting of the ways.*' He pic
iured the *oe. starvation and national decay that would
follow adoption of the gold standard. It was a fine
speech, a great oratorical effort, but in warp and woof
it was folly, ignorance and nonsense.
The gold standard is adopted, and among its tz
sults are our control of the world's trade, our trans
formation from a debtor to a creditor nation and the
transfer of the world's clearing-house from Londot;
to N'cw York. All this has come to pass instead of
the national decav which Vest predicted. As a result
of controlling the world's trade we are compelled to
jn.y lo foreign ship-owners $160,000,000 a year in
ocean freights. If, by the expenditure of $40,000,000
in a lump, we can keep that $160,000,000 a year in our
own hands, to be fper.t for the profit of Americans
irstead of foreigner*, people who are not orators nor
Missouri statesmen will sr?y it is economy to spend
the $40,000,000.
But Vest differs. He is an orator and a manufac
turer of figure? of speech. He excels in sarcasm and
i<= a professional denouncer. But while he orates the
procession moves on, made up of the busy workers
of the country who have pushed it to the front among

No argument against the continuance of the Grand
Jury system has ever fully satisfied the American
people, because it has never yet been shown how the
duties expected of a Grand Jury could be better ful
filled. Accordingly the people have maintained the
system and hoped for the coming of better things.
It now appears the good times are coming. When
in New York, St. Louis, Baltimore and Richmond
grand juries can accomplish great movements toward
reform, it is not to be doubted that in other cities the
same good may be attained.
On this coast, so far as we remember, there have
never been any grave scandals affecting the personal
honor of grand juries; 'but, on the other hand,
grand juries have never been of any notable service in
exposing such wrongs and outrages as go on among
us. Chinatown stands as a continuous reminder of the
inefficiency of San Francisco grand juries; nor does
it stand alone. Time after time has a Grand Jury
gene out of office with afinal report asserting on the
part of the jurors a moral conviction of wrongdoing
among public officials, but without submitting a tru?
bill against anybody or revealing by its investigations
the full extent of the evils of which it complained.
Such reports are encouraging. It is not to be de
nied that the American people have been for a long
time skeptical of the u?es of grand juries, and in many
cases it is known they have been as great an evil
as any they were called upon to remedy. Last year
there was an elaborate discussion of the subject in
Pennsylvania brought about by a declaration from a
Judge of the Superior Court that grand juries are no
longer serviceable to American communities. During
the discussion evidence was submitted showing that
juries are frequently packed by political bosses and
used for the purpose of forcing violators of the law
tr. pay tribute to avoid indictment, and that some
times "even innocent parties have been threatened
into the payment of blackmail.
The pities in which these rare and wonderful tHings
have occurred are New York, St. Louis, Baltimore
and Richmond. In New York the jury has brought
to light the horrible nnstreatment of patients at Belle
vue Hospital and has made an investigation seem
ingly without fear or favor, so that a great wrong
in that city is in a fairway to be righted and the re
sponsible parties brought to punishment. In St.
Louis the jury has examined into charges against the
police force and it is said has revealed not only a
general system of corruption but the practice of
wholesale violations nf the election laws. In Balti
more, according to the Sun of that city, the last Grand
Jury "proved of invaluable service in pointing out
many abuses and suggesting remedies for existing
evils"; w'hile from Richmond comes the announce
ment that the city has been shaken from center to
circumference by Grand Jury disclosures.
EXTRAORDINARY GRAND JURIES.
WITH the new century there have come from
Several grand juries in the East reports that
may be truly called sensational. They have
been valuable reports. They have won the commen
dation of the public. They have actually acomplished
some good. Such, at any rate, are the statements that
come to us from the Eastern press, and, while state
ments from that source are not always accurate,
there will be in this case a general inclination to
accept them. A valuable Grand Jury rs something
this country has lacked for so long a time that the
show of as many as four of them at one season is too
attractive to be met with skepticism.

Progressive Tax on Bachelors.
A bill to Impose a tax of J5 a head on
bachelors is before the Michigan Lesrtsla

of this discourager of slngrle blessedness.
The other day he told DavSd B. Hill that
be ought to marry and that while he re
mained a bachelor hÂ« should be made to
pay a good stiff tax for his freedom, ris
ing with age to a verv high rate. Mr.
Wu's plan of a progressive tax is the only
practical way to accomplish the result.
If the tax Is only S3 almost any bachelor
will pay it cheerfully rather than face the
bills for dry goods and baby carriages
which come In after the wedding. A tax
on bachelors, .however. If established,
should be accompanied by one on old
maids. In these days, when women ar
so very Independent, preferring "career"
to wlrehood and motherhood, they. too.
should pay for their freedom. If the man
is gander enough to remain single give
him a dose of tobasco: and if the woman

men who are aware that minions of better men have
milked cows and fed presses are simply disgusted with
his advertising methods. But it is safe to say that the
"hired men" at headquarters will manage the next
convention, and that the great and peerless photo
graphed will be there and will be the nominee.
The Pacific Coast i? impatient at the delay. We
want a shorter water route in order that our ocean
facilities may be best utilized. Our exports are
needed to swell the foreign trade of the country, and
will increase with the better facility for their trans
portation. We have many forms of merchandise that
will not bear rail transportation, and are therefore of
but little value beyond their local use. With .the canal
completed our lumber and timber output will greativ
increase, because we can reach the lumber consuming
side of the continent with cheaper freights than can
be had by rail from the timber regions in the middle
of the continent. Our base ores, canned goods and
other great supplies that are germinated in our varied
resources will receive value by use of the canal, and
our people are impatient with the policy which, under
a pretense of patriotism,* is blocking the project in
the interest of its enemies.
If the treaty had been promptly ratified, as it should
hrve been, the canal bill would now be the law. and
work on the great project would be ready to begin.
The President and Secretary of State see this, and
the administration his pressed forward in good faith
io secure the speedy beginning and completion of the
canal. Their reward has been a tempest of lampoons,
in which they are represented as English lackeys and
servitors of royalty. By and by the people will see
that the canal project is impeded by this pseudo-
Americanism, which calls bad faith patriotism, and
then several politicians who are serving the enemies
of the canal and injuring the people will hear of some
thing to their disadvantage.
This country need not expect a speedy conclusion
in the British Cabinet upon the amended Hay-
Pauncefote .treaty. The amendments were the most
effective means that could have been used to delay
the canal. Direct opposition to the project, per se,
vould not have succeeded. The best way in which
to get this country to injure itself is by making the
politicians believe they are injuring some other coun
try. This method was adopted by the enemies of the
canal, and its success has been complete.
However, the change wrought in English affairs
by the death of Victoria will probably suffice to hold
the whole subject in tbeyance until the present Con
gress expires. The corning to power of a new sov
ereign implies changes in the British administration
that will delay all international matters indefiniteb'.
The new King and Lord Salisbury have never been
or. cordial terms, and the venerable Prime Minister
may choose to voluntarily retire, or Edward may
choose to suggest that he needs rest from official la
bors that have borne heavily upon him. .
The Democratic members of the Senate regard it
a? good policy to pr<-Â« abrogation. The better way
would be to consult Great Britain, the party of the
second part of the agreement, and endeavor to gei
her consent to a mutual cancellation of the treaty.
This would be an innocent and orderly process, con
sistent with honor and good faith, but it would not
be what Mr. Bryan regards as "good politics."'
THE C0NAL
THERE is but little prospect of canal legislation
by* this session of Congress. Under normal cir
cumstances it would have been surprising had
the British Cabinet acted upon the amended treaty in
time for Congress to proceed. If the amendments
are not accepted we would have to make a new treaty
or abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer convention. Making
a new treaty requires time, and there is a sense cf
honor that revolts at abrogating the old one, â¢which
was made at our instance. Of course nations can re
fuse to keep their word; they can do that which is
forbidden to individuals and can break promises and
keep bad faith instead of good. But it has not vet
teen agreed that they can do so and retain the re
spect of the world.

RECENT KANSAS LYNCHING.
Pastor of First African M E. Z'on Church
Commends The Call's Stand.
EDITOR CALL: I have read with great Interest the editorial In Sun
day's Call of the 20th inst. on Ihe grrave subject of lynching In .Kansas. I
have also considered the Import of thÂ« language used, and I must confess,
sir, that It Is one of the fairest and best articles of Its kind that I have ever
read from the pen of any newspaper writer of the country; and I have read
quite a number of them, from both newspapers and magazines from all over
the country and also England. And therefore, on the part of my church and
the people at large In the city and State, I express to you their sentiments
of high appreciation for you and your paper and for the manly and digni
fied stand which you have taken In defense of my race and justice toward
them.
Xo Intelligent, honest, upright, cultured- negro, who maintains a high con
ception of morality and religion and intellectual refinement, would dare sup
port one of bis race in rape or any crime In violating the laws of any
land. I, with an untold number of my race, am willing to banish every rap
ist from the face of the globe, be> he black or white; but give him Justice
before the law. Give him a fair trial, and then If he cannot prove himself
innocent he must suffer the consequences of the law. Or render unto the
negro the thing that belongs to the negro and unto the white man the thing
that belongs to the white man: or. In other words, give every man equal justice
before the law. ,
And since your paper. The Call, demands It, yes, Justice to my race. Long
may your paper live to do much good as an evangelistic organ, advocating
the practice of exact justice to all American citizens alike. I am respectfully
your obedient servant, . Â¦ T. BRO"W>Â»,

as well as thirst for wider dominion
prompted this occupation of what In Eu
ropean eyes was a new continent. No one
nation was able to appropriate and secure
the whole. Each grasped what it could.
Nor were all the acquisitions of any sln
Â§le states contiguous to one another. They
otted the surface in seizures of various
dimensions. Thus the African map re
sembles a crazy quilt in its delineation o*
frontiers. Sometimes the boundary line
follows the course of stream or the bar
riers of mountains. More often, it is deter
mined by meridians and parallels of lat
itude, irrespective of the ground.
In this recent race for empire three na
tions . have led the vanâ Oreat Britain.
! France and Germany. None of them had
much to do with the circumnavigation and
investigation of Africa in the period of
great discoveries four centuries ago. Great
Britain and France, liKe Spain, were first
to devote their energies to reslons wea*
of the Atlantic Portugal, which found
the southern route to India, circled Africa
with its factories. Holland, escaping from
the tyranny of Spain, mads settlements
at the extreme south. Reminders of thes^
Portuguese conquests still exist In Angola
and Portuguese East Africa on opposite
sides of tha peninsula. All that Holland
possessed passed to Great Britain at th->
close of the Napoleonic wars and became
the nucleus of what is now the colony of
the Cape of Good Hopa. Finally thÂ» Dutcn
colonists, called the Boers, detesting the
British yoke, trekked to the east. After
countless hardships and vicissitudes they
pressed Inland and founded tha two re
publics of the Orange Free State and the
Transvaal. The Ottoman empire in thi
reign of Selim the Ferocious conquered
Egypt and by that acquisition won for Its
Sultan the title and rank of v_alti>h. Un
der the Corsair Khalredden Pasha, better
known as Barbarossa, it subdued the
whole western coast of Africa In the oaya
of Francis I and Charles V. Broken up
Into various Barbary States those pet'.y
countries terrorized the Mediterranean
and acknowledged only nominal subjec
tion to the Sultan. Afterward France
completed what our own Commodore DÂ«
catur had begun. She -humbled the Dey o!
Algiers and in 1S30 took permanent pos
session of his capital and country.
Yet even then, at a time so recent, de
sire for the acquisition of Africa hardiv
existed among the European states. Great
Britain Indeed wished to retain the colon-,*
of Sierra Leone, which had been founded,
like Liberia, as an asylum of emancipated
slaves. Also she jealously guarded the
Cape of Good Hope because of Its
strategic Importance. But In 1540 she for
mally withdrew from tha rising colony of
Natal. In 1354 the Britishâ Parliament
voted the British colonists then resident in
the Orange Free State the sum of Â£43.000
aa Indemnity for the withdrawal of Brit
ish protection. It was then deemed expe
dient to avoid all lncumbering responsi
bilities in the heart of Africa.
To this temporary Indifference on the
part of Great Britain, and to this absten
tion on the part of France, the story of
the last thirty years presents a marvelous
contrast. Disunited Germany In 1S71 found
herself a consolidated nation on the proc
lamation of William I as German Emperor
at Versailles. She, who had counted little
in the political congress of the peoples,
now became a world power. She was
ardent to extend beyond the contracted
limits of her old boundaries. France, di
minished in area and enfeebled by a dis
astrous war, sought reparation and con*
solation anywhere for what she had lost.
Great Britain had mean time become as
eager for African territory as were the
French Chamber of Deputies and the Ger
man Kaiser.
It would be tedious to narrate the subse
quent steps in the partition of a continent.
Starting from Abyssinia as a base, France
has pushed toward the equator and
reached the Ivory coast of Upper Guinea.
Beginning from Lake Tchad, she has oc
cupied all the northern or right bank of
the Congo. Also between the German
province of Togoland and .the British ter
ritories on the Niger she has absorbed tha
kingdom of Dahomey, of execrable mem
cry. She deposed the Dey of Tunis and
annexed his territory, thereby Incurring:
the lasting resentment of Italy, who had
counted on Tunis as sure to fall to her.
Altogether France is acknowledged as su
preme over more than 2,900,000 square
miles In Africa. The German empire has
taken 1,000,000 square miles, comprised In
four great provincesâ Togoland between
the right bank of the Niger and the Gulf
of Guinea; Kamerun. northeast of the
Gulf of Guinea and west of the French
Congo; German Southwest Africa, which
reaches from Portuguese Angola to tha
Orange River north of the colony of Good
Hope; German East Africa, south of Lake
Victoria Nyanza and north of the Portu
guese province on the channel of Mozam
bique. But Great Britain, in extent of ter
ritory, in importance of position and In
undeveloped resources, has absorbed for
herself the lion's share. The statement
that more than 3,000,OIX) square miles are
already British conveys little appreciation
of her relative paramountcy. The list of
her African colonies, protectorates and
dependencies serves rather to fatigue than
to enlighten. Between the Orange and
Limpopo rivers the still unconquered
Boers resist her domination, as their an
cestors three centuries ago contended
against the might of Spain. But she en
velops the mainland with her islands, con
trols almost every harbor and with a sin
gle break of only a few hundred miles
spans the prodigious area from the
mouth of the Nile to the Cape of Good
Hope.
In the very heart of Africa, Intersected
by the equator, is the Congo Free State
wedging Its way to the shore. It com
prises about 900,000 square miles" and is
subject to the King of Belgium. South of
the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are
Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland,
wrested at a terrible price from Abyssinia
and more associated with disaster than
success. "We3t of the channel of Mozam
bique Is the French island of Madagascar
larger than France. Off the northwestern
coast are the Spanish Canaries and tha
Portuguese Madeiras and Cape Verdes.
No single word indicates the nature of
the dominion which the different states
assert. Egypt, owning the Ottoman Sul
tan as its nominal suzerain, Is as definite
ly British as India or Hongkong. Lower
Egypt Is denoted as held by "British oc
cupation." Upper Egypt Is under the "An
glo-Egyptian 'condominium.' " The Nila
above Fashoda Is a "British sphere of In
fluence," which five degrees from the
equator Is called a "British protectorate."
Despite international* conventions and
definition of frontiers, political and Indus
trial Africa Is still In a chaotic state. Its
future is an enigma like Its Sphinx.
EDWIN A. 4SROSVENOR.
Amherst College.
Moreover, prolific DuropÂ« was over
crowded with population. New fields of
habitation were necessary for Its super
fluous life. The current of emigration had
set overwhelmingly across the Atlantic to
the United States. The emigrants were
thus I lost to their native country. Optn
up Africa and the pioneers and colonists
might then strengthen the forces and
Increase the wealth of the countries from
which they came. Sound statesmanship
Nor does It have primary reference to
the value of the land appropriated and to
Its capability of development or coloniza
tion. Each nation seeks to forestall the
others, so that In the contingencies of the
future It may be found in prior possession.
A greed or lust for acquisition was . a
main characteristic of European nations
during the last decades of the nineteenth
century. The glob* was growing small In
its capabilities of appeasing the spirit of
national expansion. Compared with the
rest of the world Africa was virgin soil.
And so the western powers resembled the
colonists who poured over the boundaries
of Oklahoma. Each obtained what It
could, not entirely because such posses
sion was desired, but to prevent any other
from obtaining it. The- barren Island, the
candy desert, the naked rock, were no
less eagerly seized upon and possessed
than the fertile plain or the bank of navi
crable rivers.
This "occupation" Is up to the present
day a thing denoted on the face of the
map rather than an accomplished fact.
It does not mean that the laws of the
foreign possessor are enforced, or that his
flag floats over all the territory to which
he has asserted pretensions. It Indicates
a measure in view of future action rather
than present enjoyment. It Is a declara
tion of what is hereafter to be done, rath
er than a doing of it to-day.
No census of the population ever has
been or could be taken. Any estimate
must be based upon conjecture, and is
entitled to no more credit than an Intelli
gent guess. These guesses range from
126,000.000 to 165.000.000 as the probable num
ber of the inhabitants. Morocco Is the
country nearest Europe, and has been
known slnte the time of the Romans. Of
its people it might be presumed we should
have definite information. But the Moor
ish Sultan. Mulal-Abd-el-Azlz, cannot tell
whether 2,750,000 or 9,400,000 human beings
are subject to his scepter. Thus much
do the best authorities differ as to the
population of this one little state. The
Abyssinian Menelek II rules over from 3,
000,000 to 6.000,000 souls. In Liberia it iÂ»
supposed there are between 1,000,000 and
2.OUO.0O0, and in the unconquered part of
the Sahara probably l.OOO.OoO more. Thus
in these four states, or districts. Includ
ing altogether less than 1,000,000 square
miles ofterritory. there are from 8,000,000
to 17.000,000 persons. All the rest of the
African continent, about 10.000,000 square
miles, is claimed as their territorial prop
erty by the European states. All the rest
of the African people-from 115,000,000 to
150,000,000â are asserted by those, states to
bo their tributaries and vassals. These
statistics of dimensions and numbers
might be dull, were it not that they dem
onstrate as nothing can the resistless ar
rogance and self-assertlveness of Euro
pean brawn and brain.
This foreign domination or appropria
tion of Africa is commonly Indicated by
the term ".occupation." A foreign state
puts forth a claim to certain territory.
This claim Is acknowledged by other
foreign states or by that foreign state
which has an adjacent claim. The wishes
of the inhabitant3 are not consulted m
the matter. They are not supposed to
enjoy and do not exercise any influence
in the decision which profoundly affects
themselves and their property. In the
vast majority of cases they do not know
that they have passed from a condition
of savage independence Into subjection to
some sovereign or nation, of which maybe
they have never heard. But the claim
once recognized in Europe at a conference
called a convention, the map Is adjusted
to indicate the new supremacy. The sov
ereignty over the native becomes trans
ferred. If on Bome future day he resists
a representative of his self-appointed rul
er, he is regarded and probably treated as
a rebel. He cannot appeal to Internation
al law, whclh knowB him not. He has no
hope except in the humanity and gener
osity of his master. In other words, the
same principle and practice have been ap
plied In our day to Africa which In the
sixteenth century were applied by the
European states to the newly discovered
Western hemisphere.
The lahd In America was regarded as
destitute of Inhabitants, or, at most, lived
upon by Inhabitants who had no political
and almost no other lights. Treaties with
the natives were in general only addition
al precautions for the defense of the new
comer. Some nations were less Inhuman
than others, but the process of convert-
Ing the "unoccupied" into the "occupied"
was everywhere the same. The Justice
or Injustice of the process has never
changed. If It was wrong when, at the
end of the middle ages, undreamed-of re
gions were revealed to the wonder of
Europe, it is wrong now. It was no more
and no less right then than it is now.
But let one glance at the political map
of Africa. At the extreme northwest Is
the Mussulman kingdom of Morocco,
whence In the eighth century the Moors
poured Into Spain. At the extreme east,
cut off from the sea and shut up In its
mountains, la the Christian kingdom of
Abyssinia. At the southern extremity of
the great western bulge la the petty re
public cf Liberia, founded early In the
nineteenth century by American philan
thropists as a home for freed or recap
tured slaves, and enjoying still the pro
tection of the United States. In the vague
Sahara, south of the Turkish province of
Tripoli and northeast of Lake Tchad. Is
a sandy tract left to the unconquered Be
douin. Save these four regions of Insig
nificant extentâ Morocco, Abyssinia, Li
beria and a part of the Sahara â the whole
expanse of the map is marked over 'with
the names of those European powers
which assume to be the proprietors, the
real though distant landlords of this con
tinental estate. Except in those four re
gions nothing is left as the political pos
seeajon of the African, to be administered
In some primitive fashion by himself. He
has thus become the subject of the Euro
pean. The European continent impends
over the African continent as its master.
The area oÂ« Africa is 11.514.000 square
miles. Hence, with the exception of Asia,
it is the largest of the continents, and
occupies more than a fifth of the entire
land surface of the globe. Europe is small
in comparison, being less than a third as
large.

a misunderstanding somewhere and the

latter lost part of her rail, but was not
seriously damaged, and went to sea with
her tow. - The Loomis was not hurt to

THE officers of the ToyO KIsen
Kaisha steamship Hongkong- Maru
asserted at noon yesterday that
she was not going to make any
thing but her usual time to Hono
lulu. She went out under easy steam, but
when last seen by the Merchants' Ex
change lookout at Point Lobos there was
a line of smoke a quarter of a mile long
behind her. -The Hongkong- Maru Is go
iriK to make time to Honolulu.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's new
mall boat Sonoma left port Just 2 hours 3
minutes behind the Hongkong Maru. The
former made a record run from Philadel
phia to San Francisco, but then she is
brand new and it will take her six months
to "find herself." All the parts do not
work in harmony, and until these differ
ences have been adjusted the Sonoma will
not be able to show what a really mag
nlflcent liner she Is.
In spite of the fact that the Sonoma's
bottom is still rough and that she has
still to "find herself," bets were freely
made yesterday that she would beat the
Hongkong Maru all the way from eight
to twelve hours to Honolulu. The officers
on the Sonoma said that she would run
on schedule time, but the lookout at Point
JLobos reported that when Pilot Jordan
went aboard the America the mall boat
also began to "smoke up," and when last
seen she was making at least seventeen
knots an hour.

P.eierved Seats 25c. Matinee Sunday.tion from the downward course was due to
purely technical causes. Even the opening
advance In prices was largely due to manipula
tion, which began in the London market on
cabled order* from here before the New York
market opened. The general steadiness In the
London market, the rapid recuperation In the
condition of the Back of England and the
continued ease of money, in spite of large
withdrawals from the market by the bank,
point to an early reduction In the Bank of
England rate. The opening prices of otockt
here proved In most caÂ»*-s to be the highest.
The weakness of the steel 6tockÂ». which began
from the opening, proved a disappointment for
those speculators who had hoped that the
group would assume the ;<?adershtp of a new
a/Ivance in prices txx-ause of the strength
fhown fcy the leading MÂ»?*l storks yesterday.
Yesterday's advance proved sufficient to bring
in buying orders and 'the speculative backers
of these stocks seemed Indisposed to offer very
vigorous support. The coterie which bought
stocks on Monday were credited with celling
to realize, and there were large Belling orders
all day which was attributed to Chicago ec
count. The reported illness of the larpf-st ln
â¢lividual orx?iiitor In the street and who' has
been suppowd to be long on stocks had con
siderable influence en sentiment, but the real
basis of the reaction was the failure to at
tract any renewed cutslde speculation, as
r!eÂ«j-!y demonÂ«trated by the_marice<l decline in
tee Â«etl% - lty In the trarket. Some attention
was given to the reports of friction between
the English and Russian admirals in Chinese
waters. Tne day's statement of Treasury
operation* reflected the payments en account
of gold withdrawn for export, which more than
Â¦wiped out the previous week's ea.ln by thÂ«Â»
banks. A notable feature of the current tnon*y

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Jan. 24.â May wheat opened HÂ®
Me lower at 74%o, influenced by Liverpool
cables, which ignored the advance here yes
terday. While the Liverpool market was again
open business there was at a standstill and
this condition had much to do in the dullness
which pervaded the local pit during the fore
noon. There was.some lalrly important buying
by bulls on the falling off in Northwest re
ceipts, but Bcalpers were bearish and did most
of the selling;, the market thus being confined
to local hands. May rallied during the fore
noon to 75c, but trade was dull. Later trade
was more active, some early settlers covering
because of lighter receipts at primary Western
points and seaboard clearances of 739,000 bushels
in wheat and flour. May ascended to 75Hc and
closed strong, HSHc up at 75Uc.
Corn was moderately active. The wheat
strength was accountable in a measure for -the
firmness, but the market also showed consid
erable Independent strength. There was enough
selling to have developed weakness had there
been any, but liberal offerings were well taken
Shippers were ' fair buyers and there was a
good cash demand while the country movement
was reported slow. May sold a shade higher
at the close. -
Oats were strong, but the market was local
and narrow. Sympathy with wheat and corn
was the chief factor. May closed %Â®Uc higher
Provisions were dull, narrow and bare of
futures. May pork closed 15c lower, May lard
6C?7l4c down and May ribs 5c depresssd
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Northern CaJifomiaâ Fair Friday, fresh north
erly winds; light frost in the Interior Friday
rooming.
Southern Californiaâ Cloudy Friday, cooler;
light northerly winds.
Nevadaâ Cloudy unsettled weather Friday,
with showers in northern portion; cooler.
Arizonaâ Cloudy unsettled weather Friday.
Vtahâ Cloudy unsettled weather Friday;

San Francisco and vicinity â Fair Friday,

â¢"Nuts are quiet. Almonds show firmness
tnrough the whole list, with a tendency to
higher prices. Shelled almonds particularly
are firm, and under the cost of Importation.
The market In Sicilr has advanced Ss to 10s

cables. Jordans and Valencia shelled are very

Mall eSvices from New York say: "Trade
continues slow. Some Inquiry Is noted for Cal
ifornia loose raisins, but holders decline to
meet buyers' ideas. Bids of S?Â»c for 3-crown
goods of fair quality were turned down yes
terday, the holder asking 6c firm. Offerings
Â»t the latter quotation are not numerous, many
asking 6Uc and some even higher for best
etock. Prunes are virtually dead on the epot.
Coast advices Ftatc that outside holders have
made reductions on their holdings equivalent
to those recently made by the association.' so
that their prices are now correspondingly as
much under the association list as they were
previous to the late <!iop on large and email
Fires. Currants are stronger abroad, but there
is only a very Fmall demand on the epot, and
the market shews no change for the better.
Good stock is about steady. Poor quality goods
are eaÂ«y. Evaporated apples are quiet, with

eituation is the heavy reflux of national i>ank
notes. Yesterday's Treasury statement shows
that reeelDts of bank notes for current re
demotion thus far this month have amounted
to JUJ.Sfl,60S. For the six months ending
January 1 the total was SC3.333.S4S. The aver- |
age per working day previous to this month j
was a little over 1120.000. while for this month
thus far the average Is considerably over J700,- !
000 per working day. Experience shows that J
this return movement of bank notes is likely
to continue heavy during February and March,
and in view of the expansion under the new
law of about $5-5.000.000 in national bank note
Issues. It Is likely to be aggravated this year.
The limitation of J3.000.000 per month as the
maximum allowed for retirement of bank notes

very strong. Americans were good, Chi
cago, Milwaukee and St. Paul leading on
talk of 7 per cent dividend for that stock.- This
department moved up steadily until the New
York opening. When that came in flat, the
rise here was stopped. It was assumed that
the cause of the reaction In New York was
the gold shipments to Paris. Toward the close
here and in the Etreet aiterward the break waa
very sharp.
Call money was stronger at 3 per cent.

JUDGE CONDEMNS
FELLOW-SERVANT LAW
Hands Down Opinion in Case of Den
nis Maher "Who Was Injured Â¦
in a Collision.
ST. LOUIS. Jan. 24.â In passing upon
the case of Dennis A. Maher, a fireman
on the Union Pacific-road, who lost his
legs in a collision near Trinidad, Colo.,
Judge Calflwellof the United States Court
of Appeals, to-day vigorously condemned
the fellow-servant law. Maher was on a
passenger train that collided with a
freight, the crew of which had misread
the orders. Had the orders from the train
dispatcher been faulty the fellow-servant
law could not have been pleaded.
In Judge Caldwell's opinion, which Is
concurred in by Judges Sanborn and
Thayer, he says;
"It is conceded that the plaintiff was In
the strict line of his duty when he re
ceived his injury, and nothing but the
common law fellow-servant doctrine, as
that is construed by the Supreme Court of
the United States, stands in the way of
recovery. That rule is, in the judgment of
the writer of this opinion, extremely un
just. The rule has been abrogated in a
good many jurisdictions, and in the opin
ion of the writer ought to bÂ« abrogated
in all."

CAUGHT STEALING
AN EXPRESS PACKAGE
SAYS MILLIONAIRES ARE
RUINING UNIVERSITIES
DENVER, Colo.. Jan. 24.â Frank Hag
erty, who came here from San Francisco
two weeks ago, was arrested to-night,
caught in the act of stealing a package
from a Wells-Fargo express wagon. A
large number of express packages have
been stolen In Denver lately. The police
have wired San Francisco to learn Hag
erty's record. The prisoner says he works
as a waiter and a bartender.
A Wells-Fargo wagon was backed up
in front of the market on Arapahoe street,
between Sixteenth and Seventeenth.
About 8 o'clock to-night Driver Lewis was
in the market delivering a package. He
left his brother, Ed Lewis, in the wagon.
On Wednesday night the same wagon was
robbed of two parcels. Ed Lewis con
cealed himself under the packages in the
wagon, revolver in hand. Presently an
active young man climbed up en the seat
and was in the act of reaching down into
the wagonbed for a package when Ed
Lewis appeared from cover, and threaten
ing to shoot, ordered him to surrender.
The stranger leaped from the wag-on and
dashed up Arapahoe 6treet to Seven
teenth. Lewis started in pursuit and he
gained on the fugitive, who, seeing that
his chance of escaping was small, threw
up his hands.
Representatives of the Pacific, Wells-
Fargo and the United States Express
companies visited headquarters this even
ing to see the prisoner.
Dr. E. A. White Protests Against
Subsidizing of Institutions
of Learning. .
CHICAGO, Jan. 24.â Dr. R. A. White of
the Stewart Avenue Universalist Church,
in a speech before the Midcontlnent Con
gress of Religions mx the Fullerton Ave
nue Presbyterian Church, declared against
the subsidizing of great American uni
versities by American millionaires. .In
stitutions which have been so endowed
&nd subsidized "Are to lose their [tower
of spreading education; are to become
narrow and restricted, and finally are to
suffer absolute disintegration." were the
views Dr. White expressed. He declared
that events at various universities and
colleges had caused a suspicion In the
public mind that an autocratic influence
had already been thrown over professors
and students.
Rev. Jenkins Lloyd Jones, who followed,
raid: "I do not look for absolute corecion
in the American universities which have
been richly subsidized, but that thing
which I do fear is suggestiveness. Pic
tures of a great benefactor in the chapel,
in the library and halls, together with
eulogies now and then by professors,
might mold the mind after a time until
this 6Uggeetlveness might have the same
effect as coercion."
DEPOSITORS SUE STOCKHOLDERS
Litigation Growing Out of the Union
Savings Bank Collapse.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 24.â The organized de
positors of the defunct Union Savings
Bank to-day began suit in the Superior
Court against Howard A. Alexander and
seventy-six other stockholders of that in
stitution and the Union Savings Bank to
collect $60 per share unpaid on the bank's
capital stock.
The complaint states that on January
IS last the State Bank Commissioners
ordered the directors of the Union Sav
ings Bank to call In the whole of the un
paid subscriptions of the capital stock of
the bank, but the directors have failed
and refuse to do bo. The depositors have
also made repeated demands that this be
done to meet their claims, but the direct
ors have Ignored their requests. The ac
tion filed to-day is to compel the bank
to take such action and to force the stock
holders to pay un the amount due.
The Union Bank/was capitalized at $1,
000,000, divided into 100,000 shares of the
par value of $100. So far only $30 per
share has been paid on the stock, leaving
$70 per share unpaid. The plaintiffs ask
that K>0 per share be called In.
If the suit Is successful and the amount
collected it will result in depositors being
paid in full.

MANILA, Jan. 24. â General MacArthur
has ordered the deportation to the United
States of George T. Rice, editor of the
Daily Bulletin, a marine Journal. Rice
will sail on the Pennsylvania on Monday.
The order characterizes him aa a "danger
ous incendiary and a menace to the mili
tary situation."
Rice's offense was publishing a state
ment that Lieutenant Braunersreuther,
captain of the port, had charged excessive
pilotage fees, a percentage of which he
had kept for himself.
The report of Major Mills, inspector gen
eral, who Investigated the allegation, com
pletely exonerated the captain of the port
and contradicted the editor and the mer
chants who had given him information
and who had been misled by figuring the
rates upon the net instead of the gross
tonnage, the latter being specified under
the Spanish law. Â¦ *
Rice was summoned to the office of the
governor general's military secretary
and was called upon to promise that he
would publish no more such articles. He
declined to give such a pledge, but insist
ed that the article was truthful and took
up a defiant attitude when threatened
with deportation. Â¦
The deportation order was then issued,
and Rice is now awaiting the departure
of the Pennsylvania. When seen" in jail
to-day he reiterated his statement that
the charges were "true, and declared that
in any event the severity of the sentence
was unmerited. Rice came originally from
Red Wing. Minn., and was formerly" a
member of the Minnesota Volunteers.
The hearing of the municipal govern
ment bill to-day developed an attempt on
the part of prominent Filipinos to secure
a delay of two years before taxing- land
where the owners are unable to cultivate
on account of the dangerous situation in
the fighting territory. The bill originally
deferred taxation for a year.
The Commissioners adopted an amend
ment providing that land owners who are
not implicated in the insurrection after
March and prove that the unsettled con
ditions prevented the working of the land
be exempted for the second year.
Lieutenant Steele with ten men of the
Forty-third Regiment and seven native
soldiers fought a fierce half-hour's en
gagement with a large force of Filipinos
at Tenaguna. island of Leyte, January 8,
which resulted in the killing of more than
100 insurgents. Private Edward McGugie

AUSTIN, Tex.. Jan. 24.â The recent
"bringing In" of the great oil gusher near
Beaumont and the demonstration that
That oil field promises to soon rival any
in the United States in point of produc
tion, together with the xurther evidence
that the Corsicana district Is growing
rapidly in the production of the product,
has rausefl a movement to be inaugurated
by the several private Individuals and in
dependent companies who have producing
c!I wells in Texas toward organizing a
combine with a view of shutting the
Standard Oil Company out of Texas en
tirely. Immediately upon the discovery
of the great oil well near Beaumont there
vap a rush of representatives of the Stan
dard OH Company to Jiat region, but they
found that ail the prospective oil lands
â¢within twenty miles of the gusher had
already been leased to representatives of
independent companies, many of whom
rushed from Corsieana to the new district
fi? Foon as word was obtained of the won
derful discovery. It is asserted that the
owners of the great gusher propose to
operate independently of thÂ« Standard
Oil Company and that it was with that
view that a pipe line company was re
cently organized Jor the purpose of con
ducting the oil to Port Arthur, where the
product will be loaded on tnnk boats
ready for the markets of the world.
An independent company also proposes
to build a large oil refinery at Beaumont.
The refinery at Corsiran.'i as well aa the
pipe lines "in i he Corsicana district are
owned by th*> Standard Oil Company, but
it is proposed. If the present movement
looking to the consolidation of the inde
pendent companies is successful, to erect
e rival refinery in that field.

Company since they w^re thut out of the
best oil "lands in the Beaumont district,

Poses as the Son 'of a Dead Man
and Then Says That His
Father Is Alive in
China.
The bureau reported unfavorably and
the Collector denied a landing. The bov
had given a different man as his father
and had said that his father was alive.
The case went before Judge Heacock on
habeas corpus, and the boy in trying to
cover up the discrepancies in his former
testimony told such an altogether differ
ent story that his attorney lost patience
and after referring to his client as a liar
asked that a commission in lunacy be ap
pointed to examine Into hi3 sanity. Judge
Heacock appointed Dr. John E. Gardiner
and David D. Jones, Chinese interpreters,
as the commission, with instructions t>.
report at an early date.
The speaker was William M. Gibson,
who is associated with G. W. Schell in
the attempt to land Jim Yup as a native
born. Jim arrived on the Coptic on De
cember 14 of last year, and* testified be
fore the Chinese Bureau that he was born
in 1880 in Oakdale, Stanislaus County, his
father being Yip Fong and his mother
a small-footed woman. He swore that his
father and mother took him to China
when he was two years old ond that hJ <
parents were alive in China at the present
time.
The friends of Jim Yup presented to the
bureau affidavits of C. S. S. Hill. Samuel
Coffin, W. A. Griffin and other respectable
and prominent citizens of the foothill
town to the effect that about twenty-one
years ago a Chinese merchant named
Shing Yup lived. in Oakdale with his wife,
a large-footed woman, and a son was
born to them in 1881 or 18S2. When the
son was two years old he was taken to
China by his parents. The father re
turned to Oakdale a year afterward and
died and was buried in Oakdale two years
afterward. The witnesses further swore
that the picture of the twenty-one year
old Jim Yup bore a strong family resem
blance -to their recollection of Shing Yup,
who died fifteen years ago.
The astounding phenomenon of an attor
ney for a Chinese immigrant denouncing
his client in open court as an unmitigated
liar was witnessed in Court Commissioner
Heacock's chambers yesterday morning.

client is the most unmitigated, wanton
and reckless liar I ever saw in my life."

yesterday by instituting another action
covering at least a portion of $G3.G(X>.
which, he alleges, he placed in her
hands in trust, but which, he claims, she
appropriated to her own use. Special in
terest is added to the suit by the fact
that shortly after lta filing Mrs. Ander

in an action for absolute divorce.
In her action for divorce Mrs. Ander
son alleges that since their marriage her
husband has treated her in a cruel and
Inhuman manner. Inflicting grievous
mental as well as physical abuse* upon
her. In addition to a decree of divorce,
she asks for a division of their property,
together with a Judgment for alimony.
Anderson in his suit repeats his alle
gation that he left J63.000 in his wife's
keeping, and has since been denied the
! pleasure of its use. The difference be
tween this action and others filed by
him is only technical, the object of this
suit being to close another channel

Learn Facts About Coffee.
Two blacksmiths of Northampton,
Mas*.', Messrs. Thayer and McGrath, both
discovered that coffee was the cause of
heartburn and sour stomach continually
troubling them In spite of active exercise.-
They left off the coffee and began taking
Postum Food Coffee. The trouble disap-
peared at once, and both men are now :
er.thuF'.9Ft!r over Postum.
If powerful men like blacksmiths are
affect Â«Â»<1 by the drugs contained in ordin-
ary coffee it would Keem folly for brain
worker* to try to withstand the effects of
it.
Hiram Day, a man 75 years old, also of
Northampton, tad used coffee for a great
many years, and developed eerious bilious
troubles. A few months ago he left off
coffee and began using Postum Food Cof-
fee. He has recovered his health and con-
siders Poetum in every way superior to
ordinary coffee.
Edson P. Clark, also of Northampton,
Mass.. a pencil manufacturer, was trou-
bled with dyspepsia and kidney disorders.
He waa Induced to leave off coffee and usÂ«
Postum Food Coffee In its place. He says
h* has never been as well in twenty-five
year* as he is- at present, and gives the
er.tire credit to Postum. ,;
Nearly every coffee' user is HI in some
part cf the body. Coffee does not directly
affect the same organ* in every man or
weman, but the effect Is first en the stom-
ach, and from that to the nervous eys-
tem. When the nerves are out of order
it may show In the different organs, like
the kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, bowels or
some other part of the body, or the trou-
ble may show itself in a general njrvous
and unbalanced condition. When coffee Is
dispensed with and nature begins to set
up a cure it is very greatly helped In this
work by the uee of Postum Food Coffee.
for it contains certain elements that the
life force uses to build up the cells and
the grÂ»y matter In the nerve center*. Any
person cen prove this same by trial.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANTJARYQ25, .1901.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â Cnalrman Hull
of the House Military Committee thus
sums up the essential points of the army
reorganization bill, on which an agree
ment was reached yesterday by the con
ferees of the two houses:
"The artillery corps organization is
adopted, with a chief of artillery, who
will Â«ervÂ© on the staff of the general com
manding the army. The battery becomes
the unit of artillery organization. The
strength of the staff corps is left as the
two houses provided, except the quarter
master's department, in which a compro
mise Is made, uddlng two majors and six
captains and providing for twenty-five
volunteer quartermasters as long as their
services are needed.
"In the nurse corps provision is made
that the heads should be a graduate of a
hospital training school of two years' ser
vice.
"The Senate provision of veterinary sur
geons is retained.
"The pay corps Is left as provided by
the Senate, except that the number of
majors is to be twenty Instead of nine, as
adopted by the Senate.
"The signal corps is finally fixed to In
clude one colonel, one lieutenant colonel,
four majors, fourteen captains, fourteen
first lieutenants, with authority to retain
five first and five second volunteer Kleu
tenants as required.
"The detail system of the staff Is ac
cepted, with a provision that all appoint
ments to original vacancies created by
this act shall form part of the permanent
staff and not be subject to detail. All de
tails to the staff are to be for two years,
the words 'unless sooner removed'x being
stricken out. . Instead of the present sys
tem of chiefs of staff they are to be ap
pointed by the President and confirmed by'
the Senate, for a term of four years, and
as long as the permanent staffs remain
the chiefs shall be chosen from the staffs.
Lieutenants appointed to the line are to
be chosen from first and second lieuten
ants under 40 years of age. and enlisted
men of the regulars or volunteers may be
appointed, subject to the laws now In
force, except that one year's service qual
ifies Instead of two, as now required. The
advancement and retirement of Generals
Shatter, Lee and Wilson is assured by the
retention of the provision for two briga
dier generals retired and one major gen
eral."
Hull expects to get the agreement before
the House at once.
Chairman Hull's Summary
of the Essential
Points.
GENERAL EFFECT
OF ARMY BILL
Wellington then, at 5:10 d. m., forced an
djournment by raising the point of no
quorum.
Pettigrew offered an amendment pro
viding that the Dawes commission shall
file an Itemized statement of Its exnendi
tureswto January 1. 1901, and annually
thereafter. The amendmentfras accepted
and an amendment maklnsr the total ap
propriation for the commission $324,000 was
adopted. â¢
Stewart of Nevada endeavored to secure
an order for a night session for the read
ing of the District of Columbia code bill,
but Wellington of Maryland had deter
mined there should be Â»a auorum in the
Senate present for all matters and forced
several rollcalls, one of which drew from
Pettigrew the statement that a night ses
sion would be of no avail unless a quorum
was present, as no business would be
transacted. He did not Intend to filllbus
ter, he said, or to compel the Indian ap
propriation bill to make vicarious vatone
ment for other measures. .* Â¦
Aldrich of Rhode Island reported th-3
war revenue regulation bill from the Com
mittee on Finance and gave notice that h.?
would call up the measure the first o"
next week. He added that the committea
had an amendment covering the sale of
stock and merchandise under considera
tion which would bo < submitted at an
early stage. "
Jones of Arkansas maintained that the
criticism by Pettigrew of the Dawc*
commission was not well founded in any
respect. The expenditures made by the
commission for the appraisal of lands
were, he maintained, ctbsolutely necessary
In order that the distribution of the In
dian lands might be made Justly and with
careful regard to the rights of the tens
of thousands of persons Interested. Tho
work, Jones said, was being done econ
omically and thoroughly.
Pettigrew expressed the opinion that
the* whole Indian school system ought
to be overhauled, and was inclined to
believe that many of the Indian schools
in the East would better be abolished,
and In this connection he referred par
ticularly to the Carlisle school.
Pettigrew made a vigorous attack upon
the Dawes Indian Commission, asserting
that there was no more corrupt or extrav
agant body in the service of the United
States than that commission. He at
tacked the Increase from $30,000 to $300,OCO
of the appropriation for the commission.
He believed the work done by the ap
praisers of the Indian lands could be done
for 10 per cent of what the Government
was paying for it.
Jones of Arkansas added that he knew
many Indian T'chlldren who had freckled
faces, blue eyes and red hair.
Butler insisted that many of the chil
dren who were attending the schools were
white, and that trie abuse of the Indian
school appropriation was notorious.
Teller of Colorado was satisfied Butler
was mistaken. He knew personally, he
said, that children were not admitted to
the Indian schools whose parents did not
maintain their tribal relations.
Thurston answered that no children are
received upless they are Indians? no mat
ter how slight the mixture of Indian
blood. He had, he said, seen in a tepee,
with a woman evidently an Indian squaw,
children of hers which had red hair. It
was impossible, he said, to exclude chil
dren from the schools merely because
they might have red hair or a light skin.
At the opening- to-day the Senate adopt
ed the Pettigrew resolution concerning
the reported deportation of A. Mabini, a
citizen of the Philippines, to Guam.
During the consideration of the appro
priation for Indian schools Butler said
he had visited such schools and ob
served that there were children at pres
ent taking advantage of the benefit who
were not Indians, and asked what pro
portion of Indian blood was necessary to
secure admission to such schools.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â In the Sen
ate to-day the Indian appropriation bill
made fair progress. The feature of the
debate ..was a sharp attack by Pettigrew
on the Dawes Commission, which, ho
said, was very extravagant and was ac
complishing little in the way of results.
The shipping bill was not taken up, bui
to-morrow will witness a""speech on it by
Depew. It will then give way to appro
priation bills, Frye saying that he did
not wish to delay them.

Children Attend the Schools,

INDIAN SCHOOL
APPROPRIATIONS
"With $753,000,000 of appropriations, in
cluding provision for the sinking fund,
now in sight for tho coming fiscal year,"
said he, "and we are to reduce taxation,
we should Inquire diligently Into all these
matters and not go beyond that which is
necessary for the protection, glory and
honor of the country."
The Rlxey amendment was lost on a rls
lne vote^ â 46 to 94.
vandever of Missouri moved to strike
out the provision for the construction of
two armored cruisers. Lost.
Fitzgerald of New York offered an
amendment providing that the ships
might be built In the Government navy
yards. Lost, 67 to 54.
After completing the bill, with the ex
ception of a single paragraph, the House
at 5:30 p. m. adjourned.
"William J. Bryan," retorted Wheeler,
"is a great, pure and able Democrat, but
he Is not the Democratic party." (Re
publican laughter and cries of "We
thought he was."
"That statement excites merriment on
the Republican side of the House," con
tinued Wheeler, "because men who recog
nize as their party shiDboleth and main
spring of action the will of one man,
Marcus Aurellus Hanna, do not under
stand how Democrats can recognize a dis
tinguished citizen and leader and at the
same time differ with him on questions of
policy."
Rixey offered an amendment to strike
out the provision for an increase of the
navy.
Cannon, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, said he was for a sufficient
navy. But when It was sufficient, he was
in" favor of stopping. Since 1876, when the
new navy began to be built, $227,000,000 had
been appropriated for "ships (including the
provisions in the bill, but not including
$53,000,000 still due on contracts.)
Wheeler interrupted him to inquire to
whom the credit of the inauguration of
the new navy was due.
Cannon replied rather Impatiently that
the country at large did not care "*hree
hurrahs in a hot place to whom the credit
belonged." Cannon said he did riot think
Congress had appropriated too much for
the navy, but he did not think the United
States needed the largest navy in the
world. We would not be called upon to
light England. But we need a strong
navy, we had the ships andwe were going
to keep them. We. could not get rid of
them If we desired to. But we did not
want a larger navy than was needed, and
after the ships now authorized and to be
authorized by this bill had been com-
Eleted he thought the time to stop would
ave arrived.
Rlxey of Virginia, a member of the Na
val Committee, opposed tne Item for an
increase of the navy on the ground that
the recent contracts let would absorb for
the present the capabilitie3*of our ship
yards. Rixey said that if the building of
the navy was rushed along at "an inordi
nate rate in a few years new Inventions
might make many of our. new ships obso
lete. He was In favor of going slower.
Wheeler CD.) of Kentucky replied to
Rixey, contending that the Democratic
party always had been in favor of a
etrong navy.
"Is the gentleman aware, Interposed
Foss, "that William J. Bryan, on the floor
of this House in 1890, opposed further con
struction of ships?"
Speaking to a pro forma amendment,
William A. Smith of Michigan brought up
at the opening of the day's session the
question of the abrogation of the treaty
of 1817 prohibiting the maintenance of war
vessels upon the Great Lakes. Smith said
the treaty was an imposition upon the
shipbuilding and . commercial interests of
the lakes, against which he protested.
The treaty was originally made in the
Interest of peace and was very properly
negotiated. The reasons which then ex
isted have passed away. He desired to
see the shipyards of the Great Lakes par
ticipate in the building of war vessel*.
Foss, in charge of the bill, Bald the
question of a modification of the treaty
of 1817 was discussed by the Government
Commission a few years ago. It was a
matter for the State Department, not the
Naval Committee, to consider.
Some opposition was manifested to any
Increase of the navy, and Cannon of Illi
nois sounded a note of warning as to
the size of the appropriations and an
nounced that with the present appropria
tion, $320,000,000, would have been spent on
our navy and we should stop.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 24.â The House
considered the naval appropriation bill
all day and completed it with the
exception of one paragraph. The item. for
an increase of the navy will remain as
reported, namely, two battleships and two
cruisers.

EDMUND CRANE. "WHOSE
DEATH CLOSELY FOLLOWED
HIS FIANCEE'S SUICIDE.
&rÂ»Â«aHERE are many who will bÂ«
I grieved to hear that Edmund
I Crane, the well-known actor, of
Jt this city died on January 12 at
Plttsfleld. 111., under most peculiar
circumstances. "Ed." as he was known
among his friends, was touring in the
East with a company . playing a version
of "Quo Vadls" written by himself.
On reaching Pittsfleld Crane received a
dispatch Informing him that his fiance
had committed: suicide. The young actor
was overcome, land when finally strick-n
with nervous orostratlnn a phvsiclan was
Â«ummoned. The nhyslcian administered
hypodermic Injections of morphine. Crani
went on the that evenintr to p'av
the leading role. At the close of the f*c
nnd act he fell unconscious on the staee.
The curtain was rung down and the young
man was carried to his dressing-room.
Later he. wast conveved to a hote.1. where
he apparently rallied. But pneumonia set
in and he 'hung between life and dÂ°ath
for several days, attended by strangers,
his company going on. leaving him to
shift for himself.
Crane gradually sank, and appreciating
that his life was drawing to a close he
notified tho?e who were nursing nlm of his
mother's address in this city. The letter
Mrs Crane received announcing her son's
death was evidently written by some good
Samaritan. It states that the yourg actor,
in his last hour on earth, renuested that
tne windows In his room shouH bÂ» onened.
He then recited "The Lord's Prayer" in a
firm voice. Hln last words were. "May
the Lord be merciful to all mankind." Ho
then asked to be laid down, and closing
his eyes passed awav.
Messrs. Belasco and Thall. on hearing of
his death, kindly volunteered to defray all
expenses of the shipment of the young
mRn's remains to thÂ»s city. Thev will ar
rive b"re shortly. ' It has been decided to

father, the late J. M. Crane, in Calvary

with much exasperation
.Â». On .S T . esv }} : ot thls of palpable
discrimination Is talk In certain influen
tial quarters of the necessity for the or
ganization of Komebo<5v to take care of
the commercial interests of SÂ« n Francis
co in the rate matter. Letters ore-now
passing and conferences are belnir held
on this subject. Out of the situation mav
and will grow, if the hopes of Rome mer
chants are realized, an organization to do
for the merchants anri shippers collect
ively what they are individually- unable
to effect for themselves. One merchant
said to a Call reporter that thÂ« rail situa
tion Is more vulnerable now than It wai
some years ago, when other abuses forced
the citizens to form what was known as
the Traffic Association of California.
Merchants Have a Remedy. .
"The key to the whole situation " said
this merchant, "is the water. Our sea
facilities are increasing and are alrea^v
much better than thev were formerly Tf
the rail carriers declare war upon ' u<Â«
which is what they have virtually don?
in making un a schedule to takÂ«awav our
business and give it to the KaÂ«t. it must
not be thought that we are helpless to
?u lp Â»?i Un Vi lves In getting freights from
the Atlantic coast by sea. It Is easy to do
that satisfactory by ordering in time.
The huge modern steamers.' enrryhv
many times the capacity of the vessel*
of only a few years ago. have offered us
an alternative to the rai; routes whenever j
we pee fit to use it. The testimony la
tne St.. Louis rate case before the Inter
state Commerce Commissioners illustrated
our claim to be able to supply ourselves
by water, which is entirely f>nsihle "
Another merchant said: "It Is unto
President Hays now. His administration
as president of the Southern Pacific Com
nany begins just at the time when he can
help us mop* if h* feels so Inclinedâ Just
when the Middle West and the East are
prepared to take away from its the Ori
ental business. Tf. as President Hay*
says, the Southern Pacific Company
is going to act In such a manner as to heln
build un California, this is his eanv
chance to show us what ran he done T
have heard that there is already a great
deal of the passing of the buck in ex
plaining Oriental rates. The railway peo
ple ?av that they are compelled to make
the rates to meet the threatened competi
tion by thÂ» Suez canal. Then thev aiÂ«so
say. that Jim Hill began It. In former
times they said that they had to keen up
rates on account of their kicked Eastern
partners. Now they say that they havs
to nut. down rates , because of. another
wicked partner named Hill. So It goes."'
Local business men are already begin
ning seriously to fp*l the pirrh ofthe new
form of competition in the Orient bv rea
â¢on of the freight* that pass through San
Francisco from- the Eajst. One concern
reported yesterday the loss of a large
customer, in the Orient, who - had been
taken awav by Chienern ns the result of
the rates found In "Schedule F."
The schedule In question sets forth in
Us caption that it anpHes to Yokohama.
Kobe. Nagasaki. Shanghai and Hongkong.
Tt became effective Â¦- December 1, 5900. A
carefur comparison shown that on many
commodities the rates from New York to
< he Orient are not only much less than
the* combined rates -from New' York to
Ran Francisco anfl from San Francisco
to the Orient, but tk*>t thev pre also actu
ally below the. rates from New York; 5 Chi
cago, etc.. t<> Ran Francisco. A few In-'
stances ' will iTh'^-ate tM* sufficiently.
Significant Facts.
Under "Schedule F" canned goods take
a rateof 90 cents. to the Orient from all
Eastern - points, while the rate Â¦ on - the
fame goods from Eastern points -to, San
1 Francisco is ?1. Add to this the rate of
40 cents from San Francisco to the Orient
and.lt .will be seen that New York and its
allies really have a better rate than Ban
carriers as an incident to' the- Oriental en
terprises in which they are engaging.
There has been no lack of argument to
justify .the attempt to brea.k San Fran
cisco's commercial back.
New York has argued that the possibil
ity of shipping by the Suez canal entitled
It to rates across the continent, and also
across the Pacific on the Suez rate basis.
The Middle West, which is constantly
striving to take from San Fran
cisco Its trade territory. . have been
acquainted' with all the facts some weeks
and are already taking advantage of the
situation and getting the best scrip they
can upon the merchants of thÂ»Â» Orient.
Topics of "Schedule F" have been sent to
them to encourage them to he!p build up
the overland freight business for the rail

A nÂ«w and dire peril confronts the 'commercial and manufacturing interests of San Francisco. Through the greed of the' transconti
nental carriers and their allies running lines of steamers from this port to the Orient, an arrangement has been effected and is now. in operation
which bestows upon New York, Chicago, St. Louis and other centers of vast commercial and manufacturing enterprises, lower freight rates to the
Orient tnan San Francisco has when the rate to the Orient from San Francisco is added to the through rate to San Francisco from the Atlantic
and Middle West States.
Had the Eastern and Middle West trade centers been moved over night to the Pacific Coast and fronting the Orient, as San Francisco
actually fronts it now, they could not have been better placed to destroy the jobbing industry of this city than they now are. The facts are just be
coming known to the business community of San Francisco and a .huge sensation is being caused by them. This city is so intent upon the building
up of its Oriental trade that it is particularly bitter over the scheme that has been adopted to hamper and cripple it A great portion of the trado
to -which this port is entitled by reason of its position on the map will be permanently diverted if some measure cannot be devised to secure its
natural rights. Such are the views entertained by many leading business men, manufacturers and producers who have talked with reporters of
The Call in the last few days. Not until the present week has the full import of the situation dawned upon many who are. now studying it in all its
phases. Those who have looked the matter up see it clearly enough now. ,
Rail Carriers, in Conjunction With Steamship Lines, Give to New York and
Chicago Freight Rates Whieh. Are Lower to the Oriental
Countries Than to the Pacific Coast.
