a clear space to be crossed and the posse,
with rifles leveled, started toward the still
on the run. They were greeted with shots
from the rear and from the top of the
cliff. At the first volley four of the reve

Blalne Combs was the only one to cross
the open space and get refuge under the

the "shiners" for nearly an hour, when
he was forced to surrender on account of
having exhausted his ammunition. â¢
At no time did the party see 'their as

call that dissipation to which the people of San Francisco
must be educated if they do not already indulge."
It seems incredible that such a protest, earnest, gcitcral,
honest and representative of all that is best in San-Francis
co, should be ignored by the Supervisors of this city to zuhatn
it was addressed. But the gamblers are confident, and to
dav, at the meeting of the Board of Supervisors, the public
zuill know zvhethcr or not any member of that body, in the
face of a universal public opinion, dare introduce an ordi
nance which means so much of deadly harm to the city, its
reputation and its people. j
Inglesidc, so fresh in its dreadful reality to the people of
San Francisco, zvas reviezi'cd. The sad recital of homes
wrecked, lives lost or ruined, manJibod debauched and zvo
manhood destroyed, was made to people z'eho knew itsmean
ing and who then pleaded with those authorities which- have
the power to decide whether or not the thieving gamblers of
Inglcside shall be let loose again as szvarming birds of prev
upon the city. ' .
In other churches pastors spoke', zvords of zvarning to
their people, counseling them of the menace of public gamb
ling and of its dire effects upon all classes, old and young,
rich and poor, experienced and inexperienced. Men zvere
urged to use their utmost endeavor-to persuade the Supervise
ors not to take the step which means so much of evil to the
THIS city zvas thescciic yesterday of a series of deiri
onsti-ations without rival or precedent in the history
of San Francisco, Thousands of people of all classes
and creeds, representing every phase of reputable social life,
met in their sanctuaries to voice a protest against the rmivxil of
racetrack gambling and tltc rehabilitation of Ipglcside as a
field of crime and shame and death. In solemn assembly one
congregation of men and xvomcii, merchants, professional
men, artisavs, ihe heads of families, the preservers of homes
and of social purity, the representatives of all that is best in
this city, adopted rcsolutiojis pleading with the Board of Su
pervisors not to inflict again upon the city tlie curse which
once wrought such havoc.
The scene was dramatic in the extreme. The story of

legalizing of the vice at Inpleaide race

Rev. 2Â£r. BakÂ«vr not only dwelt on the
terrible evils of racetrack gambling and
the poolroom vice, bnt also spoke on the
t*peri Rambling as Been in Chinatown and
other portion? of the city. For some days
paFt Rev. Mr. Baker has, in company
Tilth two fripnds:. visited tho lottery
room? in Chinatown find had no difficulty
In purcharln^ tickets. When he ex
pressed to the Chinese lottery dealers his
fear cf taking the tickets he was told
that he ne^d not be afraid, as. they paid
"the same as a license."
Jif his address on racetrack and pool
room gambling the reverend gentleman
drew an appalling: picture r.f the evil and
\h* farts and flpures'he presented con-
FtltntPd tire strongest plea ; that the
panblers. hangers-on and riff-raff who
follow In the wake of, the IngJeside races
should not be legaHz<*d to carry on their
oaraivad Â«->f crime at the hp.nds of the
Board of Supprrifsors and the Mayor.
Although but little time was given In
announcing: his address, the First Metho

but people rarnp from all points of the city
to h*>l j> by their presence ' to â¢ protest

M*yor desires to consummate.
When Rev. Mr. Baker read the resolu

Supervisors ?rd a?ked those ia favor of

entire congregation, moved as by one im
pulse, stood Â«>rect.- At the close of the
address the pastor was heartily congrat

they Teft the peered edifice and assured
him that he could count on their loyal

San Francisco minipter* and later on the

cf the Board of Supervisors.
A. People Robbed and Spoiled.
The "P.ev. Mr. Baker in opening bis ad
dress took his text from the twenty-sec
ond verre cf the forty-second chapter of
the book of Isaiah, as follows: "But this
Is a poopJe robbed and spoiled. They are
all of them snared In hole? and they are
h;d in prisoTj houses; they are for a prey
and none delivereth."
In dwcjlins on the text the Rev. Mr.
Baker spoke as follows: "The Prophet
Isaiah 1? picturing the Oejrradatlon of Is
rael. The spoiler and the robber were not
Fatipfied with having Invaded and spoiled
the Israelites of their possessions; they
continued their depredations until they
took the Israelites themselves, root and
branch, for a booty and for a prey. The
conditions to which they were reduced are
a very good illustration of the condition
in which San Francl^cd has been and
t=ha!l be if the hordes -of gambling spoilers
and robbers shall be permitted to carry
on their diabolical work under the ordi
nance, if it shall be passed by the Board
of Supervisors. Gambling is a black spe
cies of sin. In whatever way you look at
It it is a highway of wreck and ruin. And
thoye who travel this road are many. I
would not attempt to give you the names
of all the travelers in this way, but I
know of a few, such as the pokerists
and the r>oo!ists and what is commonly
termed atnonr some as the skin, as the
stool pigeons, and many others, but I
am not versed enough with tho terms to
mention them all. The largest class who
come under this monstrous, this Insatia
ble Moloch, are those commonly- known
among gamblersâ pardon the phraseâ as
sucker*. It 1* to the ravages of this
ppoller and robber of the people of this
fair city that I call your attention to
n!pht. U-v
"We would be aroused If our lawmaking
body should. j>errait the overrunning of
our city Â¦with an unlawful horde. We are
all well informed that an attempt is on
foot to. license the gambling robber and
despoller who will waylay the unsuspect
ing in our city and break Into our homes
and wreck and ruin them and destroy all
that makes home pure, destroying our
fathers and husbands, our promising eons
and even our daughters. There is an at
tempt on foot to turn loose upon the peo
ple cf Ban Francisco the hordes of con
scienceless gamblers and racetrack hang
ers-on."
Throttle Iniquity to Death.
Rev, Mr. Baker then referred to the de
feat of a gambling ordinance by ths
earnest work of the press, and. continu
ing, said:
"I did not know until yesterday, when I
learned of It through one of our leading
dailies, that an attempt was being made
by the organized gamblers of the race
track association to have passed to-mor
row by the Board of Supervisors an j or
dinance restoring them X,o the privilege of
robbing, of spoiling dr.d.of murdering,! a3
they did In gone-by years. These papers
f rand as the might}' sentinels of our lib
erties and moral safety against these on
comlng horde? of crime-breeders. Again
they have called our attention to this mat
ter. 1 have said before, and I say It again
%p-&lght, one ot the most encouraging^
peoplc of San Francisco. Mayor Phelan was denounced
for the extraordinary position which he has assumed in this
matter, which may be one of public zvel fare or public injury.
In some churches the regular services were abandoned
in order that on the eve of the day zvken the gamblers will ask
the Supervisors to license them for a season of crime noth
ing should be left undone by the reputable people of the city
to prevent l the outrage and save themselves from the menace
of an evil which once had been destroyed. The character of
these zvidespread protests could not be mistaken. It was not
the opposition of a single class, clerical, political, social or
cammereial, but of ail united in one common cause and moved
by the knozvlcdge and dread of experience.
It was the protest 'of merchants who llad been robbed
by' their employes, or parents zvJwse homes had been de-

never Intended that any evil should be li

Gambling a Name for Robbery.
The Rev. Mr. Baker. then Quoted-statis
tics shewing the enormity of gambling in
the world.' Among, other things he dwelt
upon the. princely sum paid for the privi
lege of running th<Â» gambling hell at
Monte Carlo, "and said: "I don't know
how much the gamblers here will pay for
their privilege. In this case gambling Is
a gentle name for robbing; while it exists
in different form, .it may be ani it Is
productive of the worst results. It flour-
lshes everywhere and : It Is becoming a
national vice, one of the most formidable
proportions, and] it ts exerting a moat
ruinous effect,' both upon the morals and
the business 'of life. Ihe loss caused by
the spoiler, however,' cannot^ be estimated
in dollars Â£and cents. ; Thousands are

WHJiKEAS, We, the congregation of tbs First Methodist Episcopal Church
cf San Francisco, are reliably informed and believe that an effort is about
to be made before tlie Board of Supervisors, supported by his Honor James
D. Phelan, the Mayor of this city, to reopen the race course at Ingilside,
re-establish bookmaking, poolselling and other forms of gambling; and .
--. "... Whereas, This latest attempt of the gambling and criminal classes to
debauch our city, renew among us their carnival of crime and disgrace, is of dangerous
moment because of the semi-official sanction it has received; and
Whereas, The people of this city have suffered deeply from racetrack gambling by
its wrecking of homes, its dishonoring of the youth of this city, its debauchery of trusted
clerks, employes and merchants; and â¢ ' .
PLEAD TO THE SUPERVISORS FOR PROTECTION.
"The great reason why we are her* to
night Is to utter our protest against the
opening: of the Ingleslde track. That LÂ»
what we are here to protest against.
"In his message Mayor Phelan says.
according to this article which, i
have . taken from The Call: 'Pub
lic gambling Is a great evil, leading to
poverty, disgrace, defalcation and death,
which the records of the ctty abundantly
prove, and Its practice should be discoun
tenanced and suppressed.' This was ta
ken from the message of Mayor James D.
Phelan delivered to tne Board Â«Â£ Super
visors January 8, 1900, and ere he left his
office he signed the ordinance that the
Board of Supervisors passed at that time.
Now, I want to show you where the great
danger comes In, and I* want to show you
the great necessity of this meeting to
night, and of meetings like It all over the
city to-night and .even on. the morrow.
Here is his attitude to-day: *I am
In favor of a limited season' o!
horse racing.* Now, if a., thing" hi
wrong. It Is wrong at any time an*!
in any. place, it Is .wrong, all r the tjme.
The Mayor says: 'I am in favorer a lim
ited, season of horse . racing, say, thirty
days, in San Francisco. I do not believe
that we should give the gamblers of Oak
land an opportunity to have an exclusive
privilege to pick pockets simply because
we have a moral crusade on. In this city.*
God hasten the moral crusade.
Phrlan Favors Dissipation.
. " "i believe that we should permit a rac
ing season' of thirty days In San Fran
clsco, simply as dissipation for our peo
ple.' Just as if San Francisco people <JM
not dissipate . enough. - Just .- as . though
they needed some other or new'klnd of
dissipation. T would therefore approve
Of a city ordinance providing 'tox a ilm-
Hed racing season In San Francisco/
Now I am not going to. read -all of. this
article. But he suggests here,; 'While
I admit that the Legislature should adopt
some restrictive measure, I also admit
that If It doea nor no ordinance' adopted
by the Supervisors of San Francisco flx
tng.a."limited season will be effective.
Unless we give . the gamblers hare as
many days* racing as another city wo
will not accomplish tho -purpose I have
In view.*' * ..'".'
"So this ]3 the attitude of the highest
cffldal In our city! I have said enough,
and I thank you for your earnest atten
tion. â¢ :r :
"I 'am going to rrad a set of resolu
tions, and If you are In sympathy -.wttjt
me I want somebody to move, that we
adopt them by a rising 1 vote.' and" I will

the Public' Read that article' and ynu
will have some Idea of the (Wt of run
ning the races at Tnsleslde. This Is thÂ»
forjn.of the evil. then, which we are spe
cially protesting against to-night.
Â¦ "I want to say .lust a few plain thins*
to you. and I wish I could say,. them to
thousands of the citizens of San -Fran
cisco. I have done a- little personal In
vestigation myself, and. I declare to you.
after having spent several years htsomo
of the Eastern States and In smne nf tha
large cities there, that I harÂ© never soen
gambling run so wide open, even when
not prohibited by the law, as It* Is. in San

Where Is this money going?. I think it
Is high time for the better element of San

the right thing shall be done. The right
thing will be -done -whenever the bett-r

"Why Is It? Tou say you are guilty. You

Vmon on "Conscience," Bald in
part:
â¢â¢It Is the duty of every citizen, good
or bad, to raise his voice and use, his
influence to keep the racetrack closed.
It has h*c-n an unmitigated curse to the
city In the r>ast. and an acknowledged
source of vice. AVe all know of the
evil work of the racetrack in this city.
Hardly a week passed without record
ing some crime caused by that devil's
agent against humanity, besides the
constant crookedness and frequent
frauds in the conduct of the races.
"The honorable Mayor and Board of
Supervisors have far higher dutlÂ«i to
perform than considering- sny, such a
proposition. If they do what they ought,
tbry will refuse to take up a subject
which they have bo recently decided,
and decided rightly.
"They have given grreat Joy to the
be?t citizens of the city and county of
San Francisco and of the State by clos
ing the racetrack and- by voting; to' keep
it closed. If they vote now to open it
they will stand convicted by the con
science of every honorable citizen and
by their own consciences If they have
not cauterized them with the branding;
irons of Iniquity."

the Hubject of a prelude to the

BREEDER OF

THE congrfiratlon of the First

pastor. Rev. F. S. Ford, last
evening by commending hlÂ« views
on racetrack gambling. The preacher
taid la i>art:
â¢'The people â the Christian people
should r.-.nd by Tfae Call in Its opposi

Haa Francisco. Those who favor Us

"If the exclusion of the racecourse is
an exclusion of ramblers and book
makers it is the be<Â«t quarantine this
city can have. I m'ould rather have free
plague and smallpox. It Is better for
men to lose their live* than their souls.
"The Supervisors can't afford to an
tagonize the Christian sentiment of this

more, before announcing his text, de
voted some time to a discussion of the
scheme to reopen the nefarious Ingle

"The Call, in its Issue of yesterday

to Introduce in the Board of Supervisors
to-morrow a resolution in' favor ;of re
opening Inglenlde racetrack, and allow
ing the gamblers to once more ply their
nefarious work of demoralization and
debauchery. Beaten at the polls, these

warning has been sounded by The Call.
I have performed my duty in empha
' sizing the peril. The obligation now
.rests upon the men and women of San

mediately and so energetically that the
gamblers of this city, together with
their aiders and abettors, shall under
stand that not for thirty days, nor for
one day, j shall Â¦ they be permitted to
sow their seeds of ruin and death."
GAMBLING IS
A GREAT EVIL
THB congregation of the Emmanuel
Baptist Church was stirred, last even-
Ing by the sermon preached by their
pastor. Rev.Â«J. Georjre Gibson, against
the reopening of the Ingleside track. Dr.
Gibson did not rmnce his words in discus
sing the evils of gambling. He said that
the track was a blot on Ban Francisco,
and when It was wiped out a year ago
every good citizen rejoiced. He said any
effort to reopen the nefarious place would
be unjust to the people of this com
munity and he trusted that the Super
visors would not demean themselves by
such an act. The Ingleside track has left a
wake of ruin in this city and turned many
a home Into a hell.' In part he said: _ .
"The old auestlon Is the newest. " Every
age has Its own vice. It seems Impossible
to kill some evils. We must not get dis
couraged. If we thought the evil of gam
bling was gone when the racetrack was
closed we were mistaken. We must take up
the fight again, inglealde is a blot on San
Francisco. It Is making many a home Into
a hell. It Is turning children Into the street
to beg their bread. It Is making many a
father unfaithful to his wife and children.
It Is Increasing the Idle men In town. It Is
causing people to pile up . debts ] that will
never be paid. It Is decreasing our venera
tion for women.
"Not until It comes home to ourselves do
we realize -what harm gambling is doing.

REV. E. K_*AXDER. pastor of the
Flirt English Ixitheran Church,
preached an able sermon against vice
to this city. He dwÂ«lt at lenjrth en
K ambling, and In doing; eo denounced the
racetracks now ruw.lnir in full blast In this
vicinity. He contended that they were do
in^ Irreparable Injury to the city. He
also said that any more to reopen the
Ingleslde track should be blocked by the
decent element, as It was an Infamous In
stitution. He spoke In r>art as follows:
"Hothlag Is gained by calling- our city the
worst place in the world. Those who have
resided In South America, IXirope or Asia,
or even la tome cities of our own land,
kaow that such talk is libel. "V\> must not
allow aolltics here to blind or distort our
vision. The city wl!l be wide open under
any party, unless a powerful public senti
ment enforces decency. We may not hope
to do away with vice. Were Christ to be
crucified again there would be raen to
rÂ«rr.b!e for his clothes right under bis
crort. To stamp out vice would require a
race cf angels and not of men. At the
same time If nothing Is done to repress
wickedness It will detsroy the city. ICo
community Is safe without an ever active
assault on evil. San Francisco cannot
Â»=ter.i3 if her decent people submit tamely
to the excesses of her most vicious classes.
There are places In our great cities that
air* 1 veritable chambers of horrors. Those
who have dared to look Into these pits re-
thlnr should be done.. Tet our boy Is not
more precious than hundreds of other boys
who are being ruined. Gambling becomes
a mania. The majority wl'.l never win
money. That would stop gambling In a
short time. Gambling is for the gala of a
small minority. The ring that manage* this
thing has no heart. If it had a heart It
would give up the business. Still, the ma
jority keep on losing, losing money, losing
some and character and are content to lose.
This vice has a charm that blinds Its vic
tims. Boys are willing- to leave their situ
ations, and men with families are wilting
to walk out of their homes.
"At present San Francisco teem* to be

they had teen. A portion of our own proud
city Is admittedly a simmering caldron of
vice and crime.
'â¢It Is eald that another effort will be
made to reopen the Ingrleslde racetrack, and
that to-morrow a Supervisor will introduce
an ordinance to that effect. AnVftort -was
made some time agpo, but so great was the
sentiment then of the better classes of our
citizens aralnst it. as It found expression
In press and pulpit, that the project mis
carried. Clergymen who dared speak -were
told that they would .do well to let those
thlnjrs alone, as it was not a function of
the church to take any part In municipal
affairs. Certain newspapers editorially-
Insinuated that the preachers had some ul
terior motive. But who could keep silence
while mothers were bewailing ruined sons
whose downward career began at the race
track, and wives wept in blighted homes
while their once respectable hUBbands con
sorted at the racetrack with jcamblers and
libertines and foul-mouthed men and flashy
'omen. Net only were horses flying around
the ring: r-ut for many a habitue honor and
domestic happiness' and fortune were racing
with fraud and profanity and ruin. And
now It Is proposed to reopen that Infamous
institution. But it cannot be done without
an outburst of general indignation, and
whatever b* the immediate .result the tn

wrath of the people finds voice. Â¦ I
M0NY hJOMES H0VE BEEN TURNED
INTO HELL BY THE RACETRACK
FHE clergymen of San Francisco made themselves
spokesmen yesterday for thousands upon thousands
i of men and women who are united in solid opposition
to the reopening of the Inglcside race course and the re-cstab
hshmeni of its gigantic evil of gambling. Perhaps never be
fore in the history of the city has there been so unanimous an
expression of opinion upon, a single subject. Eliminating all
thought of class or creed, congregations met to hear what
their pastors know of the evil of racehorse gambling and
what they fear from its threatened revival.
From many pulpits in San Francisco came* stern, sol
emn warnings to Mayor Phelan and the Board of Supervis-
ors not to violate their oath to the people by betraying instead
of protecting the sacred rights they have been chosen to
guard. And with those warnings came another that if
Mayor Phelan and the Board of Supervisors are recreant to
the trust reposed- in them they must accept the infamy which
will be the inevitable punishment for. their, offense.
With such thoughts as these the clergymen of San
Francisco spoke yesterday to their people oil the threatened
danger which menaces deeply in the proposed revival of
track gambling. And the warnings were made in order thai
the Supervisors might also hear and heed. There has sel
dom been in this city such a day of dramatic interest to
those people of San Francisco who have at heart the welfare,
of the city in which they live.

Two causes are assigned for the. lack
of cars. Ono is that the railroads are
feeling the shortage of coal, and as there
It not enough to supply the motive power
for all trains, the passenger trains ! are
given preference, and- the freight .cars
are permitted to block up at the eastern
end of the Santa Fe Pacine . on - the 'way
back to this coast. It is said that "there
are 700 cars - thus blocked up at Albu
querque, many of which are refrigerators.
The other reason assigned for the Bhprt
age of cars is that the shippers are In the
habit of leaving the cars on the sidetracks
Jnithe East while waiting for an advance
in the prices. The cars are thus retained
in the Kast, and do not get started back
for reloading even were the railroad able
to bring- them through. *

had In the future of the city.-. The wis

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Taking advan
tage of what probably will be the
last adjournment over Saturday
and Sunday, every legislator who
has a home within hailing distance of
the capital went thither. Nobody
who is anybody has remained in town ex
cept a few who look upon legislation as
a serious business and one to be studied
between sessions and a few more who
live too far away and were not included
in any junket. When so many little trips
were being made up It was hard, not to
provide a place for all, but there were
some who remained behind for a quorum's
eake.
When not planning junkets last week the
Assembly put in its time figuring how it
could relieve Mr. Franklin of the burden
of one Delehanty by transferring him to
the broad shoulders of the State. Fnftiklin
complained bitterly that he was; forced
to -feed" Mr. Delehanty. and he consid
ered that an Imposition no self-respecting
Assembly should permit. He asked that
Delehanty be made a clerk of the Com
mittee on Enrolled and Engrossed Bills,
of which Franklin is chairman, so that
Delehanty might feed himself for a while.
As Franklin had already used all "of his
patronage, he invoked the aid of the cau
cus.
1 here was more doing in the patronage
line than Delehanty. however. The San
Francisco delegation wanted Jacob Step
pacher appointed its clerk for apportion
ment purposes, and "Billy" Banks want
ed more assistant sergeants-at-arms.
About these same assistants there was
some discuesion. 'There were four of
them, but the best of reasons were given
for their appointment. It seems that to
protect the Assemblymen while they are
making laws it was decided that the floor
should be clear of all but statesmen and
committee clerks. This would drive the
assiduous workers from the floor of the
House back among the rabble and the
Long John Wilkinses in the rear of the
Assembly chamber, and as there are times
when even a lobby is a good thing to have
it was'decided to put in a second railing
just behind the desks, between which and
the present railing there would be estab
lished a "members' lobby" â a sort of
legislative limbo between the heaven of
the House and the other place where the
politicians flock and foregather. Besides,
to put in this railing would require the
servloes of several carpenters, and to at
tend Its gates -would require several more
6trgeants-at-arms. The railing would
have to be built in order to employ more
men, and more men would have to be em
ployed to take care of the railing, so po
litically it balanced.
And Steppacher's appointment, too. was
looked upon as a good thing, particularly
when a telegram was received saying he
wouldn't accept and a telephone message
followed saying he would.
These things were thrashed out in cau
cus, and they went through with a rush
that overbalanced several objectors; but
the resolution never got as far as the As
sembly. Those who had opposed it got
together and demanded another caucus
on the subject, and so the scheme is still
J In abeyance, and Franklin is still feeding
Delehanty. It was suggested that the
State could board Delehanty somewhere
for a dollar or so a day, which would be
a saving of $4 of the salary to which he
I aspires, but neither Franklin nor Martin
Kelly would stand for that.
There was a willingness on the part of
the caucus to put Steppacher in as clerk
to the joint apportionment committees,
but when the caucus resolution was block
ed some eager friend proposed a resolu
tion making him clerk to the San Fran
cisco delegation. This was coldly sat upon
by the Assembly, which was In a virtuous
mood at thÂ« time. *
The whole game of patronage as played
up here would be funny if it did not so
closely resemble a buzzards' feast. There
Is nothing clean about It. and for a Legis
lature, whose slogan Is "economy" It Is
a nauseating inconsistency. There is but
one crumb of the liberal allowance left,
and that Is for 50 cents' worth of patron
age still held by Hourigan of San Francis
co, and he holds it because he would not
loan It to anybody to make up another
place with other crumbs, and he did not
try to borrow any to put with it. It Is
the only four-bit piece In the Assembly
that is not working.
The trouble over the joint rule bids
fair to assume serious proportions before
long, for both houses are determined not
to give a step. It will simply mean that
if bills coming in from one house should
be amended in the other it will kill them
at once, and already there are veiled
threats of the mutual slaughter of bills
on both sides of the Capitol. There are
many pet measures that will be given this
happy dispatch Bhould no way around the
deadlock be devised.
eALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jani 27.â The members
of the Assembly Committee on
State Hospitals and Asylums re
turned from San Francisco to
night, having spent all of Saturday at
Agnews. A favorable report will be .made
of that institution and as a result of the
visit several bills will be introduced ask
ing for appropriations,. In addition to the
amount regularly provided for in the bud
get. The committee has not formally de
cided what Its attitude will "be -on these
measures. -
' Wright of Santa Clara will introduce
three bills, all .carrying appropriations.
One will be for $22,000 for the erection of
a cottage for female patients, f A cottage
for male patients has just been erected
at that cost out of the hospital's contin
gent fund. The work was very economic
ally done, according to. the. report of the
Afisejnblymen.-and.-the- appropriation, for
another building probably will meet the,
committee's approval. -â¢ - â¢ - : ; --:r
Another bill will provide an appropria
tion of $10,000 for a -water tower and tanks
and a new well. The old redwood tanks
in the top of the main building are re
garded as dangerous. In. their present
state, it is claimed, a slight earthquake
phock might deluge the ' entire building.,
to the peril of the Inmates and the cer
tain serious damage of the contents of
the building. â¢
A third proposed bill will appropriate
$5000 for orchards and grounds. These, ow
ing to repeated extensions of . tho hos
pital, are in bad condition, but' the com
mittee probably will not recommend this
appropriation at this time. The manage
ment of the asylum present their claims
to consideration with good grace, as they :
have not asked for a special appropria- '
tlon for six years past. â¢ :
This committee will leave next Friday :
to visit the State Hospital at Highlands,
where nearly $200,000 In special appropria
tions is sought. The southern institu
tion is said to / be greatly overcrowded,
necessitating the sending of many pa
tients from Southern California to the
; northern hospitals. The ..Assembly Com
mittee on State Prisons and Reformatory
Institutions will visit the "Whittler State
School late this. -week, leaving here, it Is
planned, about Friday. The date of its
visit to Folsom. has yet. to be determined.
Savage of .Los Angeles will introduce a
proposed â¢ constitutional amendment to
morrow by. which , the. adoption . of new
textbooks in the public schools will be
further regulated. The purpose of the
amendment will be to compel the use of a
textbook for at least six years after its
adoption, instead of /'four as .at present.
Savage claims that. the cost of textbooks
Is a real burden to many and his measure
Is intended to afford relief to such.
CAT^T. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. C7.â The Paris Com
mission investigation will take the
center of the stage on Tuesday, to
hold perhaps for the remainder of
the wieek. It has not b*Â»en decided wheth
er the committee Investigating will do its
Â¦work at night or between sessions of the
House, or whether Â»t will hold pensions all
day and finish the thins? up with a. rush.
There is a great deal of speculation a3
to the srope of the inquiry, but as the
time of the meeting draws nearer, infor
mation bearing on the investigation keeps
coming in, and it will be a wonder if thero
is not at least one gt>od sensation out cf
the affair before it nnaily closes.
ThÂ« latest tale of thÂ« doinsrs of the
commissioners comes Irom A. J. David
pon of Shasta, a miner and jeweler, who
loaned a. beautiful quartz specimen to tne
commission and now wishes he had not
done so. Davidson's specimen, was a rock
freely interspersed with gold of varying
colors, the variation being due to chem
ical action. One thousand dollars waa of
fered for it for the. university collection.
and another offer of $2500 was made, bua
they were declined.
Knowledge of the specimen reached the
attention of the Paris Commission, and
Secretary Varney Ga&kill wrote to ask
for a. loan of it for exhibition at the ex
position. Gaskill would not accept a ntg
ative reply and finally convinced Davld
pon that, as a patriotic duty, he ought to
let the commission show the world what
the mineral resources of California could
produce. Davidson agreed to the loan.
but insisted that it phould be insured for
$4500. Gasklll accepted the trust and Dav
lÂ£son gave him $50 for the insurance, as
agreed to.
The siwcimen went to Paris all right,
but when it was returned a considerable^
t^ction of it was miasinc. Mr. Davidson
wrof to Gaskill complaining about his
loss, but Gaskill ma<ia no reply. Then the
Shasta man wrote to Assemblyman Hub
bard. He took Davidson's letter to Gov
ernor Gage and was advised to communi
cate -with Commissioner W. W. Foote,
â¢who paid he would look into the matter.
Gaskill wrote to. Davidson after thl3.
Raying there was only about ten grains
missing from the specimen, and that tho
Â¦whole thine 'was worth no more than
5150. As nothing was said in GasklH's
letter about the insurance. Davidson says
he does not know whether it wu?
ever insured or what became of the $50
that he paid for a policy.
l^avldson pays GasKill'e statement that
there was only about ten ?rains lo.Â«t from
The specimen is refuted by a number of
j>hotographs of the specimen that David
eon had taken before be allowed It to go
nut of his hands. He says that any num
ber of men from Â»iis county knew ths
rock before he loaned it. and are willing
to mear that a large part of it has dis
appeared.
Assemblyman Hubbard, who is a frien<1
of Davidson. Fay? he is going to take the
matter up and that he will see that thÂ«
fa^-ts of the specimen are laid before tha
investigating- committee.
The specimen received no prize, whim
in Itself is considered a remarkable cir
f-umstanoe: but Davidson is going to find
out what happened to the lost piece be
fore he takes up anv other phase of the
subject. He says lie would rooner have
The whole specimen instead of the $4500 in
surance, and he is not going to let thÂ»
missing oieoe so without a fieht.
Varney Gaskill. T. T. Dargie and TV. E.
Darg:e Jr. will come up from Oakland to
morrow night to be rvady to appear bo
fore the committee the following after
noon.

Is. A. Emlay will arrive in Sacramento to
morrow night. The committee's Investi
gation will begin at 2 p. m. Tuesday in

SEATTLE. Jan. 27.â The little mlninj
town of Leary. thirty miles from this city,
on the line of the new Seattle and Saa
Francisco Railroad, was the acene of an
exciting holdup at an early hour this
morning. Tha saloon of Robert Murphy,
the principal resort of the town, waa in
vaded by four masked men. who startled
the bartenders and a score or more of
patrons, covered them with revolvers, and
a cleanup of all hands' Was madfl. The
robbers secured between C50 and KOO,. half
a dozen revolvers and three gold watches.
The robbery was a great lanovatlon for
Leary as the town had beÂ«n establUhe.1
only a few. months, the entire population
being employed directly or indirectly In
the coal mines. Yesterday was pay day
and during thÂ«. evening Slurphy'a saloon
was well patronized. The crowd remained,
to a late hour drinking and gambling,
when suddenly bdth front and back doors
were thrown wide open and two masked
mrn entered each with revolvers, cover
ing the assemblage. As soon as tfcÂ© rob
bers made their purpose known two of
their number guarded the doors while tha
other two went through the money
drawer and pockets of the bartenders and

SAIC DIEGQ. Jan. 27.â The Harding di
vorce case continues to drag out its weary
length in Department 2 of the Superior
Court, but it is thought that > argument
will be reached to-morrow. It seems to bo
very much of a fight of father against
family, with plenty of money on each
side. - The millionaire plaintiff, who is an

remark that they are not practitioner*

.-.Tha plaintiff, was on the stand for sev
eral hours yesterday in rebuttal. He re
lated in detail some of his dlfferencerf
with Mrs.- Harding, especially the one
brought about by his Investigation of
what Mrs. Harding kept in her private
safe. He said she deceived him by Keep
ing money that he gave her for other ex
penses and in making: bills p-oear larger
than they really were, thus Â«Â«-etting addi
tional money from him.
Upon one occasion he telegraphed her
$1000 to Vienna with the request that shj
and the children return home at once.
They returned, but did not use the money
for their fares. They had this charged to
Mr. Harding and he had to pay it a sec
ond time. He asked her repeatedly to
keep account of her expenditures, but she
never would do so. He never refused to
give her money when she asked him for
it. but sometimes he wouhl-tell her not to

memorial service for Queen Victoria was
held this evening at St. Paul's Church,
which was crowded with the people of
San Diego. Rev. H. B. Restarick. the
rector of the church, was in charge of the
services, which were largely musical.
The rector's talk was of the personal
character of the dead sovereign and of
the goodness of her reign. The service
was but little out of the usual order, In
that Casslus Carter and Eugene Daney
were called on for short addresses. The
former spoke - as a native, of America,
born. during the time of the reign of the
good' Queen across the water, and the
latter as a native of France. No attempt
had been made to drape the church with
the exception of a black Â° ribbon at . the

Bitter Arraignment From a Methodist
Pulpit in Boston.
BOSTON. Mass.. Jan. 27.â King Edward
VII, the new ruler of England, was fierce
ly assailed in his private character to
night by the Rev. Franklin E. Hamilton,
pastor of the First Methodist Church, on
Temple street. The congregation, which
Is one of the wealthiest In that denomi
nation here, was all the more surprised
from the fact that the attack v.-as made
in comparing the character of the King
with that of his dead mother. In the
course of his criticism Dr. Hamilton Bald:
It seems to me that the supreme lesson of the
life of Queen Victoria is this, that a truly royal
life has never been made to by a throne. She
made the blood-stained throne of England
truly royal because ehe passed her white life
upon it. How forcibly this truth is brought
home to us to-nlcht by the contrast between
the Queen and her successor, the present King-
Edward. Unless he changes his manner ot
living; completely not all the purple and gold
In Windsor and Buckingham palaces, not even
the ancient seat of kings, Westminster itself,
can hallow with true royalty that life which,
throu&h all years, has been that of a cheat.
rambler and libertine; and I say to you to
night it Is a travesty upon the Intelligence and
sanity of the English people that a man whose
life record ha* been such can be Inducted joy- v
ously. with the sycophantic applause of a
Christian nation, into the thrice hallowed and
sacred place of his Godly mother.
It Is the glory of Queen Victoria that is was
not the royalty of the throne, received from
crazy and dlFslpated predecessors, that ' made
her a great Queen, but the graclousness and
rlghteotianess of a Christ-like soul, and it la
for that reason that all this erase of tasselated
heraldy and pomp of human flattery fails to
nlcht.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.â The week bl
the House Is likely to be monopolized by
appropriation bills. Seven of the four
teen appropriation bills have already
passed the House, namely, the executive,
legislative and judicial, pension, military
academy, Indian, naval, river and harbor
and District -of Columbia bills. Three
others, the postofflce, agricultural an!
fortifications bills have been reported t<>
the House, and the remaining four, the
army, consular and diplomatic, sundry
civil and general deficiency, are still In
the hands of the committees having them
in charge. The ' three reported to tha
House and the consular and diplomatic,
which Is practically completed, probably
will be disposed of during the week.
Whatever time remains will be occupied
with the bill to promote the efficiency. of
the â¢ revenue cutter service, which has
been made a continuing special order, not.
however, to Interfere with appropriation
bills. The postofflce appropriation bill 13
likely to be made ihe occasion much
debate. All the questions raised by the
report of the joint postal commission are
likely to be dragged Into the arena. An
effort \ undoubtedly- will "be" made to
continue the appropriation for pneu
matic tubft service which was elim
inated from the bill. " and â¢ there
wilt probably be the usual fight tn tin
appropriations for special mall facllftle*.
It may be that in the course of the .week
a special rule will be brought in for the
consideration of one of the gold bills re
porteB by the ' Coinage," Weights . and
Measures and Banking and Currency
committees, both of. which are struggling
for ' precedence in connection with thLÂ»
legislation. But the Committee on Rules,
to which the committees appealed yester
day, has not yet come to any conclusion
and the gold bill's place in the week's pro
gramme remains problematical.

WTXIi CAUSE MUCH DEBATE.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.â A variety of
subjects. Including appropriation bills, the
war revenue reduction bill, the ship sub
sidy bill and.- to some extent, the Phil
ippine question, will claim the attention
of the Senate during the coming week.
On Monday Senator Towne will speak on
the problems involved in the government
of the Philippines. There Is .somewhat
more than usual interest in this speech,
not only because of Towne's reputation
as an orator and the fact that it will be
the only speech in the Senate upon thj
political subject, but because of increased
interest in the Philippine question,
aroused by the President's request of th^
Senate for early Tfkiwlation on this sub
ject. If does not appear probable that
the Minnesota Senator's speech will call
out other speeches immediately upon the
subject, because even Senators who would
like to see legislation during this session
admit the impossibility of taking 1 up th<Â»
matter seriously until the report of ths
Taf t Commission can be printed. r or .so
Ions as there are other pressing ques
tions before the Senate. Still, straggling
references to the subject are not improb
able at any time during the remainder of
the session.
- Senator Aldrich. chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, has given notice that
he will ask the Senate to take up the war
revenue bill early In the week. ThÂ« un
derstanding is that they will press the
question to the - exclusion of ell other
bills except appropriation bills. Being a
revenue measure it will take precedence
of other questions under the Senate rules.
'While there 'is no real oiiposltion to the
war revenue bill, it appears probable that
there will be some discussion of It as an
easy means of delaying consideration of
the subsidy bill. .If there is opportunity
the subsidy bill will be taken up, but ft
is not expected that anything more detl
nite will occur in this connection during
the Â¦Â¦ present week than the makine of

Andrew was goinp to file the petition
until after it was done. His trouble with
his heart is the real reason why he has
never taken up any business and why he
has lived such an unsettled life. He has

will do as to these dtbts I don't know.'
Younc Mr. Brown used to lire at the
rcew York Athletic Club. Recently he
has made his home in San Francisco.
Several months ago he was arrested at
the Palace Hotel there on a telegraphic
request from New York, accused of the
larcenv of some jewelry he had got from
a New York firm. His father came to his
rescue, paid the bill and the case was dis
missed. Most of his -present debts are in
this city.

Mr. Brown has found It Impossible to
Ftrupgrle alcng on an allowance of $250 a

trouble, which Is extremely pronounced,
that has caused his unsettled disposition.
i:': is the son of Lyman Brown of 159
fv'est Fifty-seventh street, and Is 26 years
eld. He is described as one of the hand-
Fimcst men who have ever frequented
the amusement resorts of the metropolis.
The young man has taken life easily and
pleasantly. Bright eyes have a way of
bfaminp on him with favor, and when
circumstances demanded that he should
raise funds In addition to what his father
allowed him. men friends easily fell under
his si>e!l and advanced him cash. One
man who. it is said, loaned him large
nmounts. said to-day:
"Brown is one of the most winsome
chaps I ever saw, but he simply can't
help being extravagant. He has been ac
customed to spend $.VK> or $<KK>. a month,
r.o matter what his allowance was. More
than once his father has paid up his
debts. Women always liked him and he
nover hesitated to make purchases in
lhrir behalf."

NT2W YORK, Jan. 27.-Willlam A. Ed
dy's seven-foot kites had reached an alti
tude of about one thousand feet In Bay
onne, IS. J., last night when the wire be
came charged with atmospheric electric
ity from the upper air. A silk cord eight
Inches long separated two small paivan
lzed iron rings, the wire from one ring
reaching to the upper air and from tho
other to the earth. Sparks automatically
jumped the gap at ofie-second Intervals,
as timed by the natch. At Intervals ot
nine and twelw Â«econdi the tr~arks hesi
tated and dropped a. second dunne tna
counts. Otherwise the sparks passed with
exact regularity, like the bea-ting of a pen
dulum. In five minutes the wire became
silent. ' /Â¦'";Â¦'! , ,,
This silence became absolutely inexplic
able since the conditions of sky. wind
and kite elevation were without percepti
ble chance. Then the aparks came again
and were" counted, now ami then in group.*
of three or four, followed by a silent wiÂ»-e
for from three to ten minutes.
Mr Eddy believes that the chance that
this ' spark regularity was intelligently
signaled from Mars is somewhat remote.
He thinks that signals could only coma
from an automatic machine on another
planet sending out electric signals decade
after decade and century after centuryâ
a continuous machine running day and
nisht all the year round.
At 8 o'clock Mr. Eddy broke the gTOtmd
contact and reunited it at four one-second
intervals, followed bv an interval of four
seconds, but no intelligible reply was re
ceived from the upper air. Â¦

There's a state of things. Demands made in writing
must be rejected, but the same demands made ver
bally will be supported "with heart, and soul." There
can be np denying that such a course "would be dip
lomatic. By verbally supporting the German demand
for more heads we shall please the Kaiser, while at
the same time leaving ourselves free to deny in fu
ture years ever having given. that support. Should
the Chinese lay. up the charge against us Mr. Conger
could ask, "Where's the writing?"
International concerts may' have their,uses, but the
facilitation of business is not one of them.,.
Recent dispatches from Peking have been curious.
It is stated: "Germany has put the screws on Eng
land, with the result that negotiations have retro
graded. The demand for^ the death penalty will be
preferred against all leaders mentioned in the decree,
in addition to posthumous degradation for such anti
foreign leaders as have committed suicide." Then
follows the announcement: "Mr. Conger stated at a
meeting of the Ministers that he could not support
the demand if it should be made in writing, -but ver
bally he would do so with heart and soul."
Early in the game Russia made a proposition that
all the powers should withdraw their .troops from
China, and after agreeing not to" dismember the em
pire should leave the rest to diplomacy and to her.
That proposition made talk for a* time and was then
shelved. Next the -United States presented a plan
that was apparently as good as any human ingenuity
could suggest. It was discussed and rejected. Ger
many had her innings next in turn, but her proposals
were of a nature altogether too medieval for the other
powers to approve, so they went into the waste
basket. Finally Great Britain submitted a plan for
solving all difficulties, but now even that has bee.i
rejected. w
COMPLICATIONS IN CHIN0.
COUNT VON WALDERSEE may not be much
of a soldier, but when he took with him to
China an eight room house and. all the equip
ments for a prolonged stay he showed that he has
a better understanding of his job than any of the
critics who condemned him for taking so much bag
gage for a short campaign. It now appears as if the
"international concert" would be in China for a long
time, and Von Waldcrsec, in addition to setting up
his portable mansion, might plant an orchard with a
fair prospect of remaining in the country long enough
to gather fruit from it. â¢
He has gone to his death full of years and honors.
His work was done to the utmost fullness. Nothing
more was to be expected , from it, , and yet it was
gratifying while he. was still alive to know that pos
sibly we might still have new music from his facile
brain, and the world cannot -avoid feeling a sense
of loss in his death. A great joy-giver has passed
away, and for a time the gayety of the nations is in
eclipse. ,
There is hardly a person having any musical gift
at all in Europe, or in America who cannot sing or
play from memory some of the strains of Verdi's
music. His operas have been the delight of the two
great classes" of music loversâ those. who delight in
it because of its sensuous sweetness and those who
,de'ight in artistic excellence of technique. To the
people and to artists alike the master spoke in a
music that seems destined to live forever; and cer
tainly the world can hardly expect to see again for a
century a writer whose music will cover so wide a
range, appeal to so many and such diverse tastes,
and rank so high in the estimation of both the cultured
and the uncultured. . ,
WHEN Dr. Johnson wrote that the death of
Garrick had "eclipsed the gayety of. nations"
he defended the phrase on the. ground that it
was "a pardonable exaggeration of affection." No
sort of apology or excuse need be given for applying
the words to the death of Verdi. The great Italian
musician added more, to the general joy of the civ
ilized world than any other man of his time. There
wa* a class that raved over Rossini, and there is a
school that cultivates an adoration of Wagner, but
Verdi was the master of the universal heart. His
music sang itself into the hearts of all who heard it,
and remained as a lasting memory to be summoned
up at will whenever there was felt a need of song to
give expression to emotion. 1
THE DEflTH OF VERDI.
Financially San Francisco seems to be flourishing.
There probably never was a time in the more recent
history of the city when money was more plentiful or
more accessible to solvent borrowers. The country
banks, as a rule, report the same plenitude of funds.
As for collections, they were nevtr better, and fail
ures ere few and generally small. The crop outlook
is fine, as the weather has thus far this winter been
ideal, with enough rain and sunshine for the growing
crops, and enough frost to keep plants and trees from
prematurely developing, to their almost inevitab'e
damage later on. With such a winter we surely outfit
to have a highly successful summer.
Aside from this unpleasant revelation there was
nothing new in local trade last week. The grain mar
ket became firmer and prices for wheat and barley
advanced several fractions, and provisions also
showed an upward tendency. There was also a live
lier movement in local securities on the Stock and
Bond Exchange, where trading had been light for
several months, and the local oil exchange rolled up
its usual large record of sales. The dried fruit and rai
sin trades continued in the dumps, though dealers re
ported rather more nibbling at the former, and as
the Eastern demand gave signs of picking up, hope3
were entertained that the zenith of the midwinter
dullness had been passed.
There was a discordant note In local trade
which our merchants will do well to correct as soon
as possible. The Call drew attention to the serious
fact that goods were being shipped from Eastern
points to the Orient at lower rates than' could bi
obtained from San Francisco. In other words, this
city, standing at the western gateway of the country,
sees merchandise, bought in the East for Oriental con
sumption shipped over its head, to Its neglect as a
shipping point In more specific terms, the freight
from Chicago *to China is less than the freight from
San Francisco to China. There is something wrong
when such an abnormal condition prevails, and it h
damaging the business of this port.
If these figures mean anything they mean that
business throughout the United States last week
was 36.3 per cent better than during the same week
last year. Just what caused this increase does not
ippear. Speculation in New York was not especial
ly heavy, but there was a pronounced increase in grain
speculation at Chicago. The great staples, such as
wheat, wool, cotton, iron and steel, hides and leather,
boots and shoes, lumber and the leading groceries,
were none of them active enough to attract any at
tention, hence the Inference is natural that H was
improvement in general trade that caused this
marked increase in the bank clearings. The failures
were larger than last year, being 306, against 231. At
any rate, we have the testimony of the bank clearings
that business is much better this year than last, which
is prima facie evidence.
The bank clearings of the country made another
fine showing, being 36.3 per Â«nt larger than during
the corresponding week in 1900. Every city of any
size in the country showed a gain except Louisville,
which fell of 7.3 per cent. The other twenty import
ant cities presented a solid column of gains in the
volume of business, the largest being 52.4 per cenr
at New York.
THERE was not much feature to general trade
last week. During: the first day or two there
was heavy selling on the New York and London
stock exchanges, due to the impending death of the
Queen and liquidation in railroad shares. This was
followed by a reaction along in the middle of the
week, which in turn gave way to another fit of weak
rcss, so the six days were very Irregular, as far as
Wall street was concerned.
APPARENT GAIN IN BUSINESS.
Fifteen new torpedo-boat destroyers
were added to the British navy last year,
their official trials giving the following re
sults: '-V;'
Surgeons in the British navy make well
grounded complaints over the slowness of
promotion to higher relative grades in the
corps. The limit of age for appointment
is twenty-eight and his relatH-e rank is
that of lieutenant with less than eight
years' service, and he does. not reach the
rankVof commander until after, twenty
years or at the age of. Bay. 48. During the
same period the lieutenant with which he
ranked on flrst Joining the navy has.be
come a post -captain, close to promotion
of rear admiral. The surgeons In the
United States navy have also cause for
complaint -in that beginning at the age
limit of 30. the rank is only, that of an en
sign and there are several Instances where
the rank' of commander "is reached only
after nearly thirty years* service, and
that of captain in thirty-six years.
The triple screw engines of the French
armored cruisers Desaix, Duplelx and
Kleber have cylinders of 34, 43 and 77.in
ches diameter, with 31VÂ£-lnch stroke, and
are calculated to devclopÂ»17,000 horsepow
er with 256 pounds of steam and 150 revo
lutions. The Kleber has twentv NIclause
boilers with a total grate surface of 1100
square feet and 35,500 sauare feet of heat
ing surface. The weight of engines' is
663 tons and of the boilers, including wa
ter. 612 tons, making a total machinery
weight of 174 pounds per horsepower. Tha
other vessels are fitted with Belleville
boilers and the three shlr>s are calculated
to make a speed of 2i knots.
The London Times of December 27 last
states that the Russian armored cruiser
Gromoboy was at Devonport dockyard
and was "taking In over 10,000 tons of
coal." The Gromoboy is of 12,336 tons dis
placement, with a normal coal capacity of
2300 tons, and the extra supply must not
alone make the living quarters somewhat
contracted, but also bring the ship dovira
away above the Plimsoll mark.
An illustration of the loss of speed of
a vessel due to foul bottom is shown In
the trials of the British cruisers Pioneer
and Pandora. The trials in both cases "ex
tended over thirty hours, the Pioneer with
foul bottom making an average speed of
16.3 knots under 3665 . horsepower, while
the Pandora with clean bottom realized
16.7 knots on 3G3S horscyower.

Jyst too jolly. . It has been a long time
since the Hobart doors have stood hospi
tably open. There have been gay events
in the Van Ness avenue mansion, ami now
it looks -as if we. might expect more of
the same splendid entertainment.
Whatever put it into the realm of rumor
that the fortunate couple were longing to
go their several separate ways is beyond
me. Probably because they were content
to live quietly pnd happily and find pleas
ure in each other's society. They gave
malicious gossips no ground "for any sort
of talk, and so the gossips Invented to
suit themselves.
The invitations have settled It. The Les
ters are not thinking of divorce. They are
as happy and loving and contented as on
the day. .they sped down the steps of the
Hobart mansion dodging to escapp the
shower of rice and old shoes.
m MALICIOUS rumor has been
/\ throttled. The Winthrop Les
f~~\ ters have sent out cards for a
I \^ ball, to be held on the evening
* â¢* of February 5, and thereby
have gladdened the hearts of their friends
and deprived the gossips of u spicy mor
sel that they have been nibbling at with
pleasure for months.

P\A AYOR PHELAN in violation of -pledges
/ \ again and again repeated has declared himself
in favor' of reopening Ingteside racetrack to
the so-called racing men with their attendant pool
sellers and bookmakers, whose practices in the past
brought so much of vice and crime upon the city as
to arouse the. indignation of all fjood citizens.' In
to become a turncoat, the Mayor has noi
been influenced by any blindness to the evils he once
opposed. In an interview with a representative of
The Call he frankly spoke of the reopening of the
track at Ingleside as a grant which would give the
gamblers an' opportunity "to pick pockets. 1 -' His one
argument to justify his repudiation of his pledges .was:
"I do not believe that we should give the gamblers
of Oakland an opportunity for an exclusive privilege
to pick pockets simply because "we have a moral cru
srÂ»de on in this city." : *>
The revival of the struggle on the part of the pro
moters' of the gambling 'scheme' is / not unexpected.
When first Ingleside was closed and the various moral
forces of the city that had achieved the victory were
rejoicing, The Call pointed out that the struggle
would sooner or later be resumed. There is an im
mense amount of money to be made by any' man or
set of men who obtain the privilege of conducting
races for, the purpose ,of gambling within the limits
of this city. Those profits are a continued. Temptation
to gamblers, and- it was a Veil assured thing that
sooner or later another effort would be made to gain
them. The renewal of the fight has come somewhat
sooner than was expected and in a manner different
from what was expected, for no one with the Mayor's
denunciations of gambling fresh in his mind- could
have supposed that within so short a time he would
desert the cause to which he' was giving at least an
outward support and throw the influence of his per
sonality and the pow*er of his office on the side of the
gamblers; "
It is not worth while at this time to speculate as
to the cause of the changed attitude of the Mayor.
The one thing to do now Is to rally'the forces that
closed Ingleside track, and unite them in a determin
ation to keep it closed despite the schemes of the
Kayor. Toward the accomplishment of that end
much has been alr.eady done. The earnest wo-ds
spoken from the pulpits of so many churches yester
day show that the pastors of the people have not for
gotten the grim evils that resulted from Ingleside
track in the past, and are as resolute as ever to main
tain the laws which prevent a revival of them.
The issue is in the hands of the Supervisors.' They
cannot be in any way ignorant of its true nature, nor
of. the characters of the men on the opposing sides.
The Mayor stated the question very mildly, when he
spoke of it as one of granting to gamblers the privi
lege to pick pockets. Crimes far worse than pocket
picking emanated from the gambling at Ingleside in
the past. There,, were betrayals of public and of
private trust, petty pilfering on the part of boys,
heavy embezzlements on the part of trusted clerks and
cashiers; there were developed the dreadful vicious
ness that prompted to murder and the awful wretched
ness that finds no end save in suicide. In support ot
the Mayor's scheme there is 1 a clique of Eastern
gamblers backed by every base influence in the city.
Against it are the pastors of the churches, the inde
pendent pfcs.s, the fathers and. mothers of families,
the heads of banks and business houses, and the uni
versal voice of the better clement of the people.
â¢ Such is the issue, and such are the opposing
parties. Argument upon such a subject ought not to
be needed. Ingleside track was closed because after
ample experience it was found to be a dangerous
menace to society, a curse to all classes; and in the
light of that experience to reopen the track would be
itself a crime. :
MAYOF^ PhJELAN'S MENACE.
SOCIETY:
LESTER BALL A SAD BLOW
TO THE GOSSIPS
â¢ BY SALLY SHARP.
Such a measure is politic, because it is right, and
because it forms the last needed protection to the
gold standard.
It is obvious, then, that free exchange with gold
at option of the holder only completes the equality of
our currencies and serves the convenience of the
small holder of silver, without giving the banks any
power to deplete the gold reserve.
September 1, 1900, the banks of New York City
held only $11,167,153 in silver certificate?; those of
Chicago held only<$5, 298,959; those of St. Louis only
$1,613,826, and all other reserve cities only $15,333,156.
At the same date the country banks held an aggre
gate of only $11,830,465. So that the combined banks
of the country held only $45,243,559- As there were
outstanding at that time in silver certificates $402,136,
6r7, it will be seen that the simple expedient of is
suing them in no larger denomination than $5 keeps
them In use as currency and out of the banks.
In January, 1891, only one-tenth of one per cent
of customs dues at New York was paid in gold coin,
and two and one-tenth was paid in silver certificates!
In January, 1893, none were paid in gold coin, but
fifteen per cent was paid in silver. In July, 1894, none
were paid in gold coin, but fifty-nine per cent of the
total was paid in silver. July, 1898, fifty-nine per
cent was in gold coin and only seventeen per cent
in silver. July, 1899, eighty-five ' per cent was in
gold coin and five per cent in United States notes,
one-tenth of one per cent in Treasury notes, none in
gold certificates, and only nine and three-tenths per
cent in silver. In November, 1900, eighty-eight per
cent of the duties at New York was paid in gold
certificates and only three per cent in silver. It h
plain that the free exchange of all forms of currency
for gold induces the use of gold in payment of dues
to the Government, and tends to maintain the gold
reserve. Again, the silver circulation of the country
is largely in the form of silver certificates. These
are in use amongst the people, and the law limits
them to denominations of $1, $2 and $5. When silver
was being paid for customs and internal taxes the
certificates were of large denominations, such as do
not pass from hand to hand amongst the people.
Since the denominations were limited these certificates
stay out of the banks and they could be withdrawn
from circulation only by offering a â¢premium for
them. Therefore the banks are deprived of the power
to use them to raid the gold reserve.
We are in the habit of ascribing' the depletion
of the gold reserve between the years 1891 and 1806
to the presentation of greenbacks for redemption
and reissue. While that was one method, the pay
ment of silver on duties and excises was also a .potent
factor.
1 It will not add appreciably to the gold obligations
of the Government. At present the holders of sil
ver have the power of exchanging it for gold indirect
ly by paying it as tariff and internal revenue taxes.
By this indirect method they keep gold out of the
Treasury and have the power , to reduce the gold
reserve. But when all forms of coin and currency
are kept at a parity by freedom of exchange there will
be no object in discriminating in favor of silver in
the payment of Federal taxes.
The advocates of the free and unlimited coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 will of course enter
the objection that such a law treats silver as a gold
certificate, but they can hardly object to putting silver
in as good a position as the paper currency, which is
made redeemable in gold.
The argument for this legislation is made by the
executive committee of the Indianapolis conference,
which body has formed and directed the gold stand
ard legislation that has been so far enacted. ' The
only way to make the gold standard. unassailable is
to provide for the free exchange by the Treasury 01*
all standard coins issued by the United States, for
each other, without discrimination, at the option of
the holder. This gives every holder and earner of
money a direct interest in the maintenance of the
gold standard, and secures the parity of all silver
money by making it as good as gold.
A brief answer would be that it is necessary in
order tefmake all our coins and currency as good as
gold, which is the desirable state toward which the
students of finance have been' directing legislation
since 1S96.
INQUIRY is made as to the meaning of the pro
posed law to make gold and silver, coins inter
changeable at the Treasury, and the necessity for it.

that will pass without being precipitated,
Our local Civil Service Commission has asked that
its affairs be thoroughly investigated by the Grand
Jury. If ever a request was made and promised 'public
nood this certainly is one. The Civil Service Com
mission must be under the influence of a wave of

Twenty-five vessels bound for Puget

Vancouver Island, 250 rallea of rocks and
reefs, strewn with wreoJrage. The Grant
will examine every square Inch of Van

men for sending the cutter north, and al
though realizing their peril the officers
of the revenue cutter service are too fa

Narrowly EscapÂ«s Death.
SACRAMEN'TO. Jan. 27.â As Charles
llondell. a railroad employe, was round-
Ing the curve at Third and R streets thJj
evening on a track velocipede, ha en
countered a light engine going out. Men
dell jumped and was trying to get hla
velocipede off the track when the loco
motive struck It. The machine was hurled
against him, Inflicting painful Injuries.
Apropos of forks, they are not men
tioned by Shakespeare, and it was not un
til after hla death that they were used
even by the higher classes. Thomas Cor
yat. writing in 1611 after visiting Italy,
gives a mlnuta description of their use in
that country. &nd adds that he himself;
"thought-good to imitate the Italian fash
ion by thte forked cutting of meat." but
his friends at home sometimes ."quipped"
him for what they regarded as a foreign
affectation. Tho dramatists of the day
also ridiculed "your fork-carving trav
eler." and a good clergyman preached
against the use of forks, calling it "an
Insult to Providence not to touch one's
meat with one's fingers."
We get not a few glimpses of school life
in that day, and Shakespeare often al
ludes to It. Before he could enter the
grammar school in his native town he had
to be able to read, and '.this he had prob-
When carpets are mentioned in the In
ventories they are coverings for the ta
bles, not for the floors, which even in
royal palaces were strewn with rushes.
Grumlo in "The Tamaig of the Shrew,"
sees "the carpets laid" for supper when
his master comes home. In the same
scene Grumlo arks. "Is supper ready, the
house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs
swept?" In "Romeo and Juliet" the la
dies in dancing "tickle the senseless
rushes with their heels*" In "Richard
II" "the presence strew'd" is the presence
chamber of the palace strewn with rushes.
These rushes were not changed until they
had become too malodorous for endur
ance, and perfumes were sometimes
burned to overcome the smell. This ex
plains allusions like that in "Much Ado"
to "smoking a musty room."
Towels, except for table use. where they
were necessarv before forks were known
and fingers were used Instead, are seldom
included In inventories of the period, and
when mentioned are specified as "washing
towels"; nor are wash basins often re
ferred to except In lists of articles used
by barbers. Bullein. writing In 1558, says:
"Plain people in the country u.Â«3 seldom
times to wash their hands â¢ â¢ â¢ and as
very few times comb their heads." In
"Much Ado." when Benedick's friends are
joking about his changed habits pince he
fell in love, Claudio asks: "And when was
he wont to wash his face?"- Baths are
seldom referred to in Shakespeare and
other writers of the time, except for the
treatment of certain diseases.
i Shakespeare's father was \ a well-to-do j
citizen of Stratford, and, as we know,
after passing through the lower grades of
municipal office, became at last a chief
bailiff, or mayor, of the town. The house
in which he lived and In w'hich it is quite
certain that the poet was born is still
standing 1 and represents the better class
of dwellings in a country town at .that day
âthe best class below the mansion of the
gentry and nobilityâ but in size, finish and
: turnishing it was inferior to the average
house which an ordinary workingman In
our country to-day 13 aLie to own or hire
in the smaller towns or in the suburbs of
the great cities. John ShaKespeare s hou^e
' has been so much rebuilt externally that,
though, the ancient style is preserved, it
has a comparatively modern look; out
there are few houses of the same period
in otratford which. a3 antiquarians as-sure
us, are little altered, without or within,
from the original form and finish, and the
interior of these closely' resembles that ot
the Shakespeare house.
These houses are usually of two stories
and were- constructed of a framework of
wooden beams, the spaces between which
were filled with lath and plaster. The
roof3 were covered with thatch- of straw
or reeds, sometimes with tiles. In "The
Tempest" Ariel says of old Gonzalo:
Ills tears ran down his beard like winter's
drops
From eaves of reeds.
Tiles are mentioned only once In "All's
Well," where Bertram says of Parolles, "I
know his brains are forfeit to the next
tile that falls" â that is, from a roof; but
tiles were mostly used in the better class
of houses, like New Place, the residence
of the poet in his later years.
Chimneys were among the "modern Im
provements" of the time. John Shakes
peare's house had one, but many of h.s
neighbors were not so fortunate. Harri
son, writing In 1577, refers to the "multi
tude of chimneys lately erected," and
adds that not many years before "there
were not above two or three, if so many.
In most uplandish towns of the realm."
In "Macbeth" there is mention of chim
neys "blown down" In the wild storm on
the night of Duncan's murder.
Hoyses like John Shakespeare's had
plastered walls and ceilings within, but
the fumlture.of which we get an idea from
ln\-entories of the time (as, for instance,
that of Richard Arden. Shakespeare's ma
ternal grandfather, who was a wealthy
farmer), was scanty, rude and plain. That
of the hall or main room of the house,
which often occupied the whole of the
ground floor, consisted of two or three
chairs, a few joint-stoolsâ that la, stools
of wood jointed together, as distinguished
from those more rudely made â a table of
the simplest construction, and possibly one
or moro "painted cloths" hung on the
walls. *
These cloths wpre cheap substitutes for
th'e tapestries of great mansions and were
often found in the cottages of the poor.
The paintings were generally crude repre
sentations of Biblical or historical sub
jects, together with maxims or mottoes,
which were often on scrolls proceeding
from the mouths of the characters.
Shakespeare refers to them several times,
as in "As You Like It." where in reply to
Jaques. Who charges Orlando with getting
his "pretty answers" out of rings (refer
ring to the mottoes or "posies" often In
scribed in finger rings). Orlando replies:
"Not so; but I answer you right painted
cloth, from whence you have studied your
questions." Falstaff says that his recruits
are ''ragged as Lazarus in the painted
cloth." and the host in the "Merry "Wives"
describes fat Jack's chamber as "painted
about with the story of the prodigal, fresh
and new"â an appropriate decoration for
the place., : . -
As I remarked at .the end of the former
paper on this subject, a series of twenty
papers might be fllle- with Shakespeare 1 s
allusions to matters connected with the
home and school life, the games and
sports, holidays and festivals. fo..vlore and
superstitions, etc.. o. the time. A few
more of these illusions may be mentioned
in this additional paper to give the reader
and student a further Idea of the richness
of the field, and. possibly, to lead him to
independent excursions in it.

pedagogue. Sir Hush Evans, in "The Mer

tnis manual. This was followed by Lil
ly's Latin grammar, rirst published in
Iol3. and used in English schools for more
than three centuries. A quotation from
Terence In '.The Taming of the Shrew'"
("Redime te captum." etc.) is given in tha
modified form in which it appears in this
grammar.
Shakespeare has many allusions to tha
Latin authors he read in school, particu
larly to Ovid and Virgil. Holofernea
quotes "the good old Mantuan." as he
calla him. who is not Virgil, as Mr. An
drew Lang assumes in an artlcie in Har
per's Magazine Â»May. 1*33), but Baptlsia
Mantuanus, or Giovanni Battista Spas

born at Mantua. He was the author of
sundry Latin ecJogues, which were then
much read in schools. Other bits of Lat

Playing truant Is no modern vice of
schoolboys. Jack Falstaff in '1 Henry
IV," asks, "Shall the blessed sun of heav

berries 7" "Mlcher," or "moocher." is now
obsolete, but it is defined In a contempo
rary dictionary thus: "Moocher. a tru
ant; a blackberry moucher. A boy who
plays truant to pick blackberries."
Of the education of elrls. except by pri
vate tutors, in the Elizabethan age. It Is
difficult to get any definite information.
Neither Ascham nor any other writer of
this time to whom I have been able to
refer has anything to say on the sub
ject, .and modern writers on the history
of education are equally silent. Dr. Fur
nivall. in the introduction to his edition
of the "Babees Book." shows that. In tna
time of Henry VIII. Rirln had the legal
right to attend the grammar schools, but
neither he> nor Dr. Furness can refer rn*
to any e%-idence that girls availed them
selves of the privilege, and I do not be
lieve that they did. There must, how
ever, have be>en schools in which they werÂ©
taugnt needlework, music and probably
other feminine accomplishments. Shakes
peare has two pleasing allusions to school
girl friendships, which seem to have b*Â«en
as warm ami sentimental as nowadays.

The Governor has discovered that there
is no use for the Pilot Commission, and
that it should be merged into the Harbor

n*Â» wants to succeed Major Harney as
Harbor Commissioner, and if the scheme
goes through all his friends would take

Thus the words of Confucius will be ful
filled. 'Let us all live in peace as broth
ers.' ".
"It seems strange that some clergymen
should resent any attempt to compare
Christianity with any other systems of
belief while they themselves do not scru
ple to attack other religions. In other
words, they do just what they do not
want others to do. Since my address on
Confucius was delivered I have seen Con
fucianism condemned right and left. It
has been called a failure; it has been
dubbed 'effete,' 'vague.' ! 'unworthy of
attention,' "rotten to the core,' 'tottering
to Its fall' and the like. I do not, how
ever, quarrel with' those who apply such
opprobrious epithets to our creed. If Con
fucianism were as bad as its detractors
try to make it out to be it Is strange that
after twenty-tour centuries It should be
able to count millions and millions of peo
ple as its adherents. The noble and sub
lime teachings of Christianity need not
fear criticism, much less friendly com
parison. Â¦ . ;
Philadelphia, Jan. ~27.-wu Ting
Fang, China's Minister Plenipotentiary to
the United States, to-day replied to his
critics In the course of s. lecture on "Con
fucius and Menicus," delivered before the
Society on Ethical. Culture at Horticul
tural Hall. Every available inch of both
seating and standing ro >m was occupied
by an audience attracted by the protest
and criticism raised by Minister Wu's re
cent utterances in New York City on the
subject of Christianity." The Chinese Min
ister's statements were, however, ex
tremely conservative. Burns Weston, di
rector of the society. Introduced Minister
\Vu, who said : Â¦ Â¦.
"Twenty-four centuries have rolled by
since Confucius walked, this earth. His
in_fluence is as greet to-day among his
country as it ever was bofore. Never was
his namg held In greater veneration thai-
It is now. Throughout the length and
breadth of tho Chinese Empire ever>
where are. temples erected to his memor>.
Every schoolboy acknowledges him as the
bupreme teacher of,the Chinese race. His
spirit pervades a nation of four hundred
millions and his word is recognized as law
to the most august Empeior on the throne
as well as to tne meaneit peasant at th*
plow. Thus Is Confueius enthroned In tne
nearts of his countrymen."
At the close of. his address the speaker
said: "I find that the address on Confu
cianism I delivered last month at Car
negie Hall in New York has attracted a
great deal of attention. It is a source of
gratification to me that the remarks made
on that occasion have elicited- comments
from tne American press which are gen
erally very favorable, and also expres
sions of approval from persons in differ
ent Darts of the country. But, on the
other hand, I have seen In the newspapers
sr me adverse criticism on my address
lrom a number of clergymen. But lest a
false impression may have gone forth in
regard 10 that address I take this oppor
tunity to say a few words about it by way
of explanation."
Minister Wu then quoted an extract
from' the sermon of the Rev. Dr. Way
land Hoyt of this city on Sunday, Decem
ber 16, In which - the latter spoke of 1.1
Hvpg Chang's high tribute to the work
cf the Christian missionaries in China
and asked what reply the Chinese Minis
ter couM make. ... Â¦
"Dr. Hoyt has done me, though doubt
less unwittingly, a great injustice," con
tinued Wu Ting Fang. "Since he wants
a reply 1 have no hesitation in giving him
one. I indorse every word that Earl U
has said on the subject of foreign mis
sionaries as cited by thp doctor. 1o prove
that 1 am sincere in what I say, I beg to
refer the doctor to the address I delivered
in December last before the American
Academy of Polytechnic and Social Sci
ence in Philadelphia on the 'Causes of
the Unpopularity of Foreigners in China."
I suppose the doctor had not read that
address, or if he had read it he has for
gotten it. In any case I would not be
lieve that an eminent divine could be
capable of purposely misrepresenting me.
"Again, Dr. Hoyt, and. some other
clergymen from their addresses, seem to
think that I charged all missionaries with
crying out for vengeance. Let me read
the exact words I used:
*' 'Love your enemy Is Christ's com
mand, but at this moment some Christian
missionaries are crying out for vengeance
and bloodshed.' Note that I used the
word 'some*.
â¢ "I am inclined to think the reason why
some clergymenâ and I am glad to say
that there are not manyâ took offÂ«nse at
what I said In my address on Confucian
ism is that I topk the liberty of institut
ing a comparison between .Confucian-
Ism and Christianity, which they supposed
: was done to the disparagement of the lat
ter. There was certainly no Intention on
my part to make an attack upon Chris
tianity. Surely it is no discredit to say
that Christianity is too high and ele
vated fqr frail humanity and that all
Christians are not acting up to Its tenets,
just as it is no disgrace to acknowledge
that the Confucianists in China do not
live up to the teachings of Confucius.
Thinks It Strange Clergymen Should
Attack Other Beliefs, Yet Resent
Criticism of Their Own
. . Creed. s ; .
Says'Not All Christians Live
Up to the Tenets of
Their Religion.

WILKESBARRE , ' Pa. . â¢ ' Jan. I 27.â The
anthracite coal operators, and .miners of
this section were much stirred. up to-day
by the report sent out from .Indianapolis
that the United Mine Workers, now hold
ing their national convention In that city,
had decided to Invite theoperators'of the
anthracite region to meet their miners in
conference and decide, upon a. new wage
scale which would call for an advance of
10 per cent over the wages paid at present.
Many think that this is a forerunner of
another strike in ; the hard coal regions,
as it is j believed the 'operators will . not
consent to meet, the miners ln conference.
Then if that were tho' ; only Â¦ obstacle a
demand for a further Increase Â¦ in wages
would probably be sure to bring about a
lockout. Nearly all the district leaders
of the United Mine s Workers r In the
Wyoming Valley are now in attendance
at the Indianapolis convention.- 1
Charles Train, a district organizer, said
to-night:' â¢ - â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢â¢ '"Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ \r : r - Â¦-Â¦.:Â¦ ; ;
"I believe the operators would meet the

The competitions In driving 1 and ap

day. The day was eminently suitable
for golfing, being warm and clear, with
scarcely any wind. For the driving com
petitions a portion of the course had been
cleared of thistles from the eighth teeinsr
ground ln the direction of the eighth
"green." Each competitor drove three
balls from a point a little to the right of
the teeing ground. The course within
which the balls must fall to score waa
marked by posts, which were placed on
each side at distances of 90 yards. 105
yards, 130 yards and 160 yards. A. ball
falling on the carry between the 90-yard
and the lC5-yard posts counted one point,
between the 105-yard and the 130-yard
posts two points, between the, 130-yartl
and the 160-yard po-ua three points, be
yond the 160-yard post four points.
The competition for men was won by
Leonard Chenery. who drove three long
and straight balls, scoring ten out of &
possible twelve points. .H. Rodman wai
second with eight points; W. Amea third

a ball bit true would go straight until
within a foot of the hole, where, en
countering a stone, it would be diverted
and require one of two more strokes to
hole out.

Special IMspatch to The Call
VICTOR, Colo., Jan. 27.-An attempt to
rob the. Jewelry store of Joseph Bitterly,
In Goldfield, this morning was frustrated
by one of Mr. BItterly's sons, who shot
one of the robbers." Â¦'
The burglars cut out a panel from the
back door of the Jewelry store, turned the
key In the lock and attempted to open the
door.' But a nightlatch near the top 're
sisted them. The noise aroused the two
Bitterly boys, who â¢ were sleeping inside
and the younger, John Bitterly, a lad ot
12 years, fired three shots through the
door. At the third shot one of the bur
glars cried out. with pain and was heard
to fall off the porch. John Bitterly then
opened the door and saw three men run
ning away in different directions. One
was holding the side of his head. The boy
called to him to stop, but he only ran
faster. Then young Bitterly fired Â¦ twice
at, the fleeing man, and the' second shot
caused him to 'cry out again. After day
light the fellow was tracked to the F; &
8. C. C. railroad trestle by a trail of blood
It is believed that a gang of six men had
planned a number of burglaries and hold
ups at Goldtteld, including the robDery of
Bitterly's store. ; :

AIX SATISFIED THAT
FIGHT WILL COME OJTP
Promoters Claim the Jeffries and
Buhlin Contest Will Se a
Fact.
CINCINNATI. Ohio. Jan. 27.â Amongf
the promoters of the championship bout
between Jeffries and Ruhlin and the
lovers of the prize fighting sport In gen
eral there seems not the least doubt that
the big boxing contest will take place on
the scheduled time, February 15.
The fact that Mayor Flelschmann has
Issued the permit has had a reassuring
eTTect on . the local patrons of tha roped
arena, as well as on those living at a
distance. The work of remodeling the
,blg hall began in earnest yesterday. It
is being pushed rapidly and will be com
pleted long before the date for the hold-
Ins of the match.
It was rumored to-day that the prin
cipals and others connected with the pro
posed contest In Saengerfest Hall wÂ«r*
to be placed under arrest to-morrow, but
that Is denied by the ministers composing
the anti-contest committee of the Evan
gelical Alliance and Reform League.

Beats Sacramento Boy in the
Big Coursing Final at
Union Park.
Mac's Melody Displays H>r Old-Time
Winning Style and Gets First
Money in the Open
Event.
The double event offered as an attrac
tion by the Union Park Caursing Asso
ciation brought out a iarge crowd yester
day and furnished a card of sport equal
to the best seen on the local field. Form
l>layers were given the hardest kind of a
reception. !\*o less than twenty-live fa
vorites were denied the flag and the short
t-nds that were recorded averaged up at
better prices than Is the rule. Certain it
is that the pikers will refer to the day as
the btst for many seasons.
The sport, too, was cf high class order
e.nd even the heaviest losers were of the
opinion that the two stakes furnished
tome great courses. Mac's Melody, T.
\V. Bartels' many times stake winner,
kept well ahead of her opponents and
with a great display of her old-time dasn
went through the different rounds and
wound up by beating Roman Athlete
polntjtfs in me deciding course of the
open stake.
In the chamrlon event Mose, the fast
flier of the Yost-mite Kennels, took first
prize- from Sacramento Boy In an exciting
CO. The victory will go on record as the
Jirst stake winning of an Australian
hound at Union Park. Hose was !Â»â¢ trim
and. showed great speed and cleverness.
The moft interesting course of the day
and the one which kept the big crowd in
a fever of excitement was that between
Beacon. Curtis & Sons' great stake win
ner, and Sacramento Boy, who heads the-
Jist of money getters.
This pair of hounds ran the greatest de
ciding course ever witnessed in this sec
tion when they came together in the last
John Grace cup event, f On that occasion
it was a case of nip and tuck for honors.
In which Sacramento Boy landed the big
prize amid the wildest kind of excitement.
Yesterday, while the stakes were not so
larpe. the hounds gave almost a repetition
of that go, witn the result the same. Sac
ramento Boy was about due for the stake
hut with this severe experience It was
hard for him to come back 50 soon for the
Jir.al. Many think that he would have had
first place if he met Mose on even terms.
Those who fancied the Boy to beat Bea
ton for the right to contest for first hon
ors were well paid for their faith in him
lor the Curtis kennel adherents backed
Â¦their hounds chances at the high odds of
S. to 1.
The best short ends were: Tyrone Prince

Several Bookmakers With Depleted
Bank Rolls Will Take a Bast.
''â¢:. Tod Sloan's Saddle Work
Highly Praised.
BY in. H3. MTJXjHOT-jI.i-A.lSro
In referring to the disposal of his con
tract on the services of Buchanan, as pub
lished exclusively in The Call of yester
day, Barney Schrieber said: "I guess I'm
bad. First I got Bullman, and 'fammany
Halh wants him.- Then this 'Dutchman'
signs Henry, and later Wall street (mean
ing James R. Keer.e) gets hold of . him.
Now with Buchanan to do my riding, the
King of England secures the boy.
Barney must certainly be a good judge
of jockeys. It is more than likely the
St. Louis turfman will oign little J. T.
Woods to do his riding. The youngster,
for what opportunities he has had, looks
like a promising green 'un. There has
been no paucity ot swagger riding talent,
though, and the obscure jockeys have had
no chance. With good horses to ride
Midget Woods may become a crack llgni
weight. Time has demonstrated mat
'"good horses make good riders."
From hearsay there will be a diminu
tion In the number of Bookmakers at to
day's cut-in. Willie Applegate was touch
ed up to the extent of X5ouu in two days,
whicn dampened his ardor considerably.
Willie told a friend he was out or form,
and will take a, vacation.
'"Conductor" McManus saw ,hls bank
roll lessened just ll'i.v.'i in one week, and
has about decided to try it with the talent
.down on the ground. - George Rose de
parts for Coronado Beach ana the Eastern
country this week. Although making the
biggest book at the track. George found
the game a pretty stiff one to beat, and
does not quit a winner to any extent. If
revenue and postage stamps were in use
as a circulating medium, Otey Evans
might have laid up something for the Sac
ramento Club. Unfortunately the book
lost $94.33 to the stake race on Saturday,
and rumor says â¢ H will be numbered
among the missing to-day.
A well-known turfman now residing at
one of the downtown hotels has a very
high opinion of Sammy Loates as a diplo
mat. From his point of view Loates is
in good enough* condition to ride, but
knowing that Tod Sloan is not in good
standing with the English racing stew
ards, does not care to take any chances
of endangering his own position. As la
well known, Sammy once, fell into an en
tanglement with the stewards that cost
him many dreary and expensive months
on the groundv Some people do not have
to be hit with a-full-sized brickbat.
The latest American trainer to receive a
proposition to cross the water and handle
an English string of horses is Gaylon
Brown. Gaylon now has charge of the
stable of A. B. Spreckel9, and is undecided
whether he will accept the offer or not.
With the disruption of the American
Turf Congress and the organization of a
new turf body, â¢ it- is- more than probable
J. McDonald will get a license. The Cali
fornia boy was reinstated by the Haw
thorne officials, but Captain Rees would
never consent to his being issued a li
cense. If McDonald is restored to good
standing he may ride for Ed Corrigan in
England.
Lindoubtedly the European' fever tele
coming contagious among our riders. On
hearing of the triumphs of Gladiator
Cash Sloan and Patsy Freeman on the
French turf and- the many successes of
Morgan, "the Indian." In Austria, Johnny
Weber has begun' pricing railroad and
steamship tickets. If Morgan is a hit in
Austria . Johnny should lose no time in
getting over there.
Tod Sloan received a world of pralsÂ©
from close observers for his ride on The
Lady In the Winter .handicap. It was the
consensus of opiuion that a prettier or
more perfect piece of horsemanship had
not been seen on any of the local tracks.
Louis Ezell was satisfied with Tod's ride
in every particular, admitting that hla
little mare wasbeaten by a better horse.

SCHREIBER AFTER
ANOTHE R JOCKEY
The much postponed game between the
Koenigs and the Alamedas waa played
out yesterday afternoon at Recreation
grounds and resulted in a victory for thi
Alainedas by a score Of 8 to 3.
The came was tedious and uninterest
ing, full of errors and demonstrations of
baseball irnoranee. A few relief meas
ures were introduced In some very clever
double plays and an occasional piece of
good outfielding..
In the third innlngr, with the score 0 to
0. Wlchman of the Aiamedas hit to L>:
Bodle, who acted as a bad man thrower,
giving Wichman a chance to skirt tha
bags while Koeghan at first looked for
the ball under the benches back of ftrsc
Then Van Haltrcn made an honest home
run, losing the syheroid over the center
fleM fence. Hammond made the third
run In this inning. In the fourth Wich
man and the Hammonds scored, making
the score 6 to 0. Errors were reeking.
In the last of the fifth, Brockhoff scored
for the Koenigs. Then Koeghan scored,
but McGee, who "tried to do likewise, was
caught at the plate. Perrine added an
other run to the list in this inning.
The seventh brought one run for the
Alamedas; so did the ninth. The score:

LONDON. Jan. 27.â A lady I met who is
generally well informed said that there is
much talk of a marriage between the
Duke of Roxburgh and- Miss Aator. The
Duke is Just 25 years old and has recently
returned from serving with the army in
South Africa as a lieutenant in the Royal
Horse Guards. Miss Astor, she is of the
opinion, is one of the prettiest and most
charming young: ladies' in society here,
and the marriage would be an eminently
fitting one and probably, pleasing to Wil
liam , Waldorf Astor. ; . .." . .

Fight to Death.
Face to face on the mountain side a man
and an ape battled to the deatn.
. It was. in South Africa; In that part of
Cape Colony Inhabited chiefly by Boers.
His name la Van Niekerk. ,_ ,
The ape was of the baboon variety. It
was almost as large as the fanner and
possessed the strength of four men.
There had been good success and the
dogs ware keyed up by victory, when an
unusually larse male baboon was espied,
clambering down a precipice. When he
reached the bottom the pack assailed him
with great fury and the men by common
consent rested on their rifles to watch tho
combat.
' A huge boarhound which had no rival
on the veldt In the chase of big game had
his throat ripped open and ran to crouch
at his master's feet .with eyes glazing
and. blood sporting from his Jugular vein.
Fearing to fire lest he should injure the
aogs. Van Nlekerk plunged into the me
lee, armed only with a knife.
. As the farmer rushed forward the ar*Â»
swung .with bis right.' No cat ever dealt
a swifter blow and yet the wary fanner
managed to throw up his shoulder to
meet' it.
He was* knocked down like & nlnepln,
but if it had not been for his quick de
fense he would have received the blow
on the point. of the jaw and that would
have been the end of him.
i -As it was, he scrambled to. his feet beforo
the baboon had time to leap upon him and
when Ihe brute cast his hairy arms about
him he delivered an upward lunge In the
Mexican fashion and plungred his knife
to the hilt in the big monkey'3 body.

Â¦WASHINGTON, Â¦ Jan. 27.â Frank H.
Hitchcock, chief of the section of foreign
markets in the, Agricultural Department.
In his annual review of the trade of the
United States in' agricultural products.
Bays:
,The fiscal year 1900 brought to a close a cen
tury of marvelous, development In" the history
of United Â£tatÂ«s commerce. In 1800, a century
ago. the total value of the merchandise im
ported and exported in our trade with foreign
countries was considerably less. than a quarter
of a billion dollars, j The value of the goods ex
changed during; the past fiscal year reached
nearly two and a quarter billions, far exceed
ing all previous records. Since the opening of
the century our commerce with the. rest of the
.world has Increased more than twelvefold.
Compared with the value of our Imports for
1900 that of our domestic exports showed an '
excess of $5M,82!,3S7.
Of the merchandise imported from foreign
countries during' the fiscal year 1900 about 49
per cent consisted of agricultural products.
Then* products had an agtcregate value of
J420.136.38i. exceeding by almost $65,000,000 the
record of the year before.
Products of United Statev. agriculture were
marketed abroad In the fiscal year 1900 to the
value of J?44.616.B30. forming; about 62 per cent
Of the total domestic exports. With the single
exception of 189S, the past year witnessed the
largest annual export trade in farm products
on record. â¢ .. . â¢
A comparison of the value of our Rffrlcultural
exports for 1300 with that of. our agricultural
Imports shows the former v exceeds the latter
by $424,480,149. The export value was slightly
more than double the amount of the import
value.
Among the agricultural Imports of the United
States for the fiscal year 19C0 the leading items,
named In the order or value, were sugar, hides
and skins, coffee, silk, vegetable liber, wool, '
fruits and -nuts, tobapco, tea, wines,- vegetable

Oreat things are expected of the new
railroad, which will bring the west coast
Into communication with the east, and
which should be finished before very long.
The chief enemy to rapid construction
is the rainy season, which is violent and
of long continuance. American capital
is well represented in the planta
tions and business Interests of the coun
try, and the climate, contrary to general
belief, is not, the Consul says, dangerous
to the health of Anglo-Saxons.
The Consul days that- California Â¦ .-Â¦ and
America generally are not getting their
full share of the trade of. Ecuador. : Call â¢
fcrnia particularly, said" the ' Consul,
.should lind a good market for its wine?

most monopolize the trade there through
their enterprise in sending drummers
through the country, whereas the-Amer
ican. traveling man is a rara avis around

ever. Is In good and constant demani
there and that is corrugated iron, which
has grown' Into great favor as a building

Composer's Memory. â¢ *
ROME, Jan. 27.â To-day's session of the
Italian Senate was devoted to eulogies of
Verdi *by the president of the Senate and
Slgnor Sarracco, the Premier.
' "The death of Verdi." said the Premier,
"has caused universal sorrow in Italy,
a sorrow felt from the royal palace to the
lowliest, cottage In the capital and from
Rome to the humblest hamlet in - the
country. The Government joins In these
sentiments." .'â¢ ' ' â¢ .'
- â¢ Signer Sarracco announced that a-mar
ble bust of the composer, would be placed
In the Senate chamber and that an oui
clal delegation would be sent to attend
the funeral, addinjj that unless Verdi's
will directed otherwise, the funeral will
be at the expense of the state.
MILAX. Jan. 27.â Although preceded by
a struggle .for life that lasted two days,
Verdi's death, when it came, was peace
Â¦ \?'C e did not rc eain consciousness.
wnen.he passed away he was surround
ed by relatives and intimate friends. The
announcement of his death created great
emotion.. Theaters, pleasure resorts and
many stores were closed and nearly all
the prominent residences were draped.
To-day the city authorities published
eulogistic- proclamations, which were
posted throughout Milan.
King Victor Emmanuel sent to the fam
ily a. telegram of condolence on behalf of
himself and Queen Helena, saying: i
1 "We join In the homage, regrets and ad
miration offered by Italy and the civilized
world to the immortal /nrmory of Verdi
The nation and the glorious art of ou.
country have suffered a loss so serious
that It Is beyond repair."
In his will Verdi asks that the funeral
may be "very modest " : He suggests that
It take! place either at daybreak or even
â¢tlde. and that the ceremony be without
music. "The chanting of two priests,
two candles and a cross will suffice,"
he wrote.
Many legacies were left to friends.
The date of the funeral has not been
fixed, but It will be probably Wednesday
or â¢ Thursday.- The interment will be in
the chapel of the retreat for indigent
musicians, which Verdi established.
The Scala Theater 'will reopen after the
funeral, with a performance in aid of the
monument fund. King Victor Emmanuel
will be represented at the funeral by the
Crown Prince. The City Council adopted

Shortly afterward the weather cleared
and the La Gascogno had smooth sailing
into this port.
After the La Gascogne left Havre she
had not been headed westward many
hours when the first of the bad weather
developed. It came in the shape of galed
from â¢ many points of the compass and
lasted for thirty-five hours. The first of
the gale, ,dui ing. the weathering of whicn
a ereat sea swept across the liner, was
encountered early Friday morning. In a
short time after it â¢ began to blow. Its
strength had bo Increased in fury that the
vessel was rolled and uitchea In making
her way through the high waves. It wa3
shortly before 3 o'clock when a sea swept
across the port side forward. Lifeboat
No. 1 was caught by the wave and the
boat tackle of the davita was snapped.
The gale finally abated, but the following
day a second storm arose. A heavy sea
struck the ship on the starboard quarter,
crushing her No. 2 lifeboat, smashing the
chocks that kept her steady, broke the
davits flush with the deck, twisted all th<j
railings on the starboard side out cf
shane and knocked a hole about four feet
square through the turtle deck. The wa
ter poured down through this on to the
spar deck, making a fearful roar and
driving the steerage passengers almost
frantic.

have a share. Noble womanhood's virtue
is not the exclusive possession of any na
tion. The secret of England's greatness
was not the monarchy but the monarch,
not the empire but the woman. And who
would not always be glad to take off hM
rrat and to bow his head to consecrated
woman? Victoria stands not as mother,
wife and Queen, but as the sovereign ben
efactor of countless millions of people.
"Time will not permit me to tell the
story of the enormous strides In human
progress which are the special feature.*
of tho Victorian era. N'or can I" dwell
on the advances of science, education, re
ligion and morality that have been greater
urinj % the last Bixt >' >' ears than during
the 1SU0 years before them. Victoria broke
down the narrowness and prejudices that
separate nation from nation. Let us
thank ood that her blood news throufih
the veins of fo many rulers of Europe. It
Is the best slgrn of the future for peaca
and prosperity. . *-*;Â«*.,..
"The life of Victoria stands for t.iree
great truths. The first Is that character

Character alone gives beine to the divine
righ L. to . rul< L mankInd - Second, her lifÂ«
establishes the true relationship between
abso ute authority and coodness of heart
and life Third, she nas shown to all tl"
world that It Is possible for a monarch to
reign and to have an '.ntensity and depth
of personal affection .or the people fir
removed from the worlo's accustomed as
sociation of despotism with monarchs "
Dr. liryan concluded with a word' pic
ture of the second sceneâ the mournin" of
a nation for a beloved ruler. Then he
"Victoria, 'was not gTeat because she was
the Queen of a great empire." said the
eloquent young divine, 'Tor because shÂ»
was of the royal blood of the house of
Hanover, but because in God's hands shi
was Instrumental in bringing relief to
millions over whom she relgneu.
"There are two scene* in the- life of
Queen Victoria which stand out in bo.-t
relief, beacons to all ihe civilized world
The nrst Is that of ihe masnllicence and
splendor of the diamund jubilee of 1837.
The other is that of the bowed heart*
waiting in grief for the message that
should tell or the passing of a noble wo
man. I remember ihe nrst picture when
I stood amoog the 6,000,000 of people In
crowded London, the air alive with per
sonal and national enthusiasm for the
Queen. There werÂ« gathered from all ends
of tho earth the colonial and imperial
representatives of her Government. And
with them In the fore front were the na

the United States of America., in ihe van.

"The Life and Influences of Queen Vic

however, but continued the correspond

which led him to request that Kads be

threatened to Ftrike his Fon-in-law. wheiv

all the witnesses in the case would be

stand small phow in a court for his life.

and then another.

Pangburn e only Fister and sole heir Is

Celfax. She is a widow and several years
;.*oungcr than her hard-hearted brother.
>t the time of her marriage brother and
Vtetar becan Â« estranged, he not approv
ing her choice of a husband. When she
became a widow he refused her aid.
Later, when throtigh sickness, she was
unnhle to earn even a meager living she
became a county charge. Appeals to
Pangburn was a pioneer farmer of the
Talouse country, living for the past thlr
Â»y-four years on a ranch near Hndlcott,
Whitman County. His death occurred at
Kndicott at noon yesterday. He was there
stiending to business matters and had
Suet eaten a hearty meal at Hooks Ho

table and with a groan sank to the floor
and soon expired. lie was C3 years old

the brother to care for her were all in
vain. She spent several years in the poor
house at the county farm, not .many
miles distant from the ranch where her
brother resided. Time after time fam
ily friends and county officials have
sought to heal the breach between broth
er and sister, only to have their efforts
profanely and vehemently condemned by
Pangburn. It apparently had been the
recert intention of the brother to Jeavo
the country, as he had started converting
his property into cash. The sister s health
has been failing. In fact, she was trans
ferred for that reason from the poor
house to the hospital. It Is believed she
may not live long enough to enjoy the
inheritance or to make use of a tithe of
the money, which, received earlier, might
have greatly mitigated her affliction.
She was greatly affected when the news
of her brother's" death was conveyed tJ
her In iier weakened condition it was
fenced for 9 time the effect of the shock
wcu<l be sorious. She hns announced her
'nunticn ot attending the funeral If the
condition of her health will permit.
i-*ricnds to-morrow will proceed in. the
Probate Court on her* behalf so that the
f'jmN l'rom her brother's estate may be
placed at her disposal at an early date,
that she may cease being an object of
charity.

sided with her parents at 232 Twenty-sec
ond avenue, died yesterday under circum-
Ftarices which caused Dr. Frank B. Petrie,

Professor Louis Lisser delivered an in
teresting lecture on "Music" at the First
Unitarian Church last night. Professor
Lisser spoke of the wonderful possibili
ties in store for the development of
musical art in this country, which, he
said, had made more rapid advancement
than on the continentof Europe,: where
the , conditions are far more favorable.
The lecturer advocated; the ; study of
music in the primary and. grammar grades
of / the public schools "on a larger
scale than undertaken in these in
stitutions at the 'Â¦ present time. He
favored the establishment Of chairs of
music in all the universities,: so that di
plomas could be given for proficiency in
the same manner as they are given to the
other' learned professions.
j "Music in its highest form," said Profes
sor Lisser, "requires active intellectual
concentration, and ' not merely a passive
Inactivity of the mind. The sense of hear
ing, must be trained in order that it may
perceive all the inherent beauties of mu
sical compositions. So-called critics of
musical productions are but poorly equlp
ed ao ply their vocations, as they, as a
rule, know little of vocal and instrumental
mu , sl c- Critics should be privileged to
:J? . tR v}* only after they have proven
their ability to do so as a result of a
specialized knowledge on the subject.
. .,' A " e rapidity of musical development on
this Bide of the Atlantic has been marvel
ous as compared to Its snaillike pace > on
the continent of Europe. Art in- America
owes more ' to unselfish, .enthusiastic
wo men: than it does to money-making
man. The people of the United States, how
ever, have not yet learned to appreciate
the artists who were born in their midst.
One muBt, unfortunately, have â¢ a foreign
name and polish to receive the plaudits of
our music lovers. : - r
The outlook for music In this country
Is -very promising. The higher musical
art is not for the masses, but only for the
cultured few. But all classes are privileged
*? en Joy the beauties of simple music
i ne love for. music increases -â¢ as Â¦ efforts
are made to systematize It.- I would have
patriotic songs in the schools, congrega
tional singing. in the churches U and -the

H. Clay Reid, proprietor of a small tan
nery pn the San Bruno road, was found
asphyxiated late yesterday afternoon in
a room of the Royal House at 771 Howard
street. Reid went to the lodging-house
shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon
and engaged ajoom from C. H. Clark,
the day clerk- He stated at the time that
he was tired and wanted to rest for two
hours.
Clark assigned Reid to a room near the
office and thought nothing more of the
matter until shortly before 6 o'clock,
when he detected a strong odor of gas
in the hallway. He made an investiga
tion, and discovering that the gas was
escaping from the room occupied by Reid,
forced open the door. Hurriedly shutting
oft the gas and opening the window, he
approached the bed. Reid was lying dead
on the outside of the bed clothing with
his head pillowed on his right arm.
Reid was about 50 years of age and
leaves a wife and six children, living at
Â¦UJ'.'SVi York street. The members of his
family are unable to assign any cause for
his suicide. He was' recently operated
upon for appendicitis, but had fully re
covered. The clerk at the lodging-house
fays that Reid was perfectly sober when
he rented the room, and there was noth
ing in his appearance or actions to indi
cate that he Intended taking his life.

TO END EXISTENCE
To-day's itinerary will probably Include
a visit to the China Basin, where the par
ty will look the situation well over with
a vievf to commencing the erection of the
new terminal of the road there as soon
as the bill ratifying the lease has passed
the Legislature. The conditions of the
contract drawn up before the Board of
Harbor Commissioners calls for an ex
penditure of a million dollars to enable
the company to retain their holding.
A brief stop was made on the trip at
Point Richmond and the officials declared
themselves highly gratified at what they
saw there. On the way out the party
spent some little time in Texas, inspecting
some new holdings in that State. Ac
cording to President Ripley the extensions
In Texas which will give the railroad an
air line from Galveston to San Francisco
are still in the abstract, and for some
time at any rate nothing will be done on
them. Mr. Ripley thinks It will be at
least two years before the roa'd gets into
Oakland. "We have a great deal of work
to do on the Valley system yet," he said.
The party will stop here only for a few
days.
E. R. RIpley, president of the Santa
Fe, and a party of the road's prominent
officials arrived in this city yesterday on
a tour of inspection of the system. They
have apartments at the Palace. The
members of the party, besides President
Ripley, are J. J. Byrne, general passenger
agent; E. Chambers, general traffic man
ager; J. M. Barr, vice president, and R.
B. Burns, chief engineer.

SANTA FE AWAITS
PASSAGE OF BILL
p-rpsaHERE was filed last week in the
1 1 [7 office of the County Clerk of Con-
I tra Costa a suit which opens a
1L chapter of litigation which it had
% been thought was long since
closed.
The title of the suit is "Grace D. Seifried
vs. Lorena Myrtle Barbier." The plaintiff
in the case, Grace D. Seifried, claims to
have been the adopted daughter of the
late Harry F. Emeric, and supports her
claim that Bhe wa3 treated as such with
the testimony of many prominent people
in San Francisco. Her father was a min
strel by occupation and her mother was
also in the theatrical line. Her father was
known as Tim Darling, and in the early
days of California, when Billy Birch was
in the height of his fame. Darling was a
member of his troupe. The couple had a
daughter, now the plaintiff in this action.
The little girl adopted the profession of
her parents at the age of 3 years, mak
ing her first appearance at the old
fected, whereby Lorena Myrtle Karbier
received a choice portion of the great San
Pablo rarcho, belonging to the Emeric es
tate and valued at about $75,000.
After the death of his first wife Mr. Em
eric remarried, and upon his death he be
queathed his entire estate to his widow.
Elizabeth Emeric, and ignored the claims
of his adopted daughter, Mrs.- Grace D.
Seifried. Mrs. Seifried promptly began a
suit against the widow, and a bitter con
test was expected. A compromise was,
however, effected and Mrs. Seifried re
ceived a substantial sum. which rumor
places at $7500. to forego her claims
against the Emeric estate.
She then instituted the present Â«suit
against Lorena Myrtle Barbier. in â¢which
she seeks to recover her share of the
property deeded to Miss Barbier. the
value of which she places at $25,000. While
the.pult had to be filed in Contra Costa
County by reason of the fact that the
real estate involved is located there, both
parties reside In San Francisco.
Both are determined women, and when
the matter comes to trial it is expected
that the contest will bo bitter and will
savor somewhat of the sensational.
It will be recalled that Harrv F. Em
eric had deeded to his first wife all his
valuable estate, which amounted to sev
eral hundreds of thousands of dollar?.
Mrs. Emeric died, and it was found that
she had conveyed all that estate deeded by
her husband to her sister, Lorena
Myrtle Barbier, and Emeric was Itft prac
tically penniless. Resort was had to the
courts and a compromise was finally ef-
Bush-street Theater, and was probably
the first child actress in the State. She
continued her theatrical career until about
1877. She was a winsome Httle girl, and
one of her auditors happened to be Harry
F. Emcric. He was charmed with her
and made overtures to her parents for
permission to adopt her, and promised,
according to the allegations of the com
plaint on file, to provide for and educate
her. and In the event of his â¢ death to
make her his heiress. The parents finally
consented, and on June 4, 18S2. the plain
tiff was formally baptized according to the
rites of the Roman Catholic church as
Grace Darling Emeric, and thereafter she
continued to reside in the family of Harry
F. Emeric until the date of her marriage
to Fred Seifried.

CQUNTT BUPERIOR COURT INVOLVING PROPERTY OP THE EMERIC ESTATE VALUED AT $75,000, AND
WHICH WILL BRING ON AN INTERESTING LEGAL BATTLE.
The Stern family were made particular
ly anxious by the knowledge that Mrs.
Stern was very ill from the mental strain
ana grief over the death of her brother,
who was burled Saturday. Naturally their
first, care was to remove her to a place
of safety. B'' this time the fire had spread
to Saratoga Hall and the Saratoga Sta
bles, "kept hy M.* Michelson & Sons, on
the ground lloor. The stable hands,' who
slept on a half floor over the carriage
department, did not awake until the
(lames had burst through the side. wail.
Peter Mullaney, a harness keeper, slept
bo soundly that his bed was on flre befoie
he awoke. The stable men ran down
stairs, leaving their effects behind them,
and turned their attention toward saving
the horses and carriages. The build
ing, which is owned by Ben U. Stein
man, ex-Mayor of Sacramento, was con
siderably damaged on the east side, -Â«.nl
a carriage and hearse in the stable were
also partly burned. The hall and upper
floors of the building were considerably
damaged by flre and subsequently by wa
ter. The greatest excitement prevailed
up to that time, and as yet no one had
the presence of mind to turn in an alarm.
AVheji the bells . were tolling the first
alarm the flre was moving, eastward and
had reached the Â¦ two-story framd at 806
and SOfiVi Geary, owned by. Mrs. Ernestine
Ephralm, and- occupied by the families of
S. M. Shawl and Charles Kelb. When
Chief Sullivan reached .the ground the
flre had veered, in a northeasterly direc
tion and attacked the rear of the build
ing at 609 Hyde street, . owned by Mrs.
Isabel Levy and oocupied by Mrs. Lena
Wolfe. The entire rear of the house was
burning rapidly, when Mrs. Wolfe, who
has been ill for some time, was carried
out on a bed to the home of a neighbor
across the street. The second and thinl
alarms followed in rapid succession, but
before the engines arrived in response the
Hre had reached- the three-story frame at
611, 611A and 611B Hyde street, owned
by Mrs. Henry Label and occupied by
Mrs. Cassie Hamilton. M. Heynemann and
Isidor Label. A few minutes later a threj
story: frame at 9 Meacham' place, owned
by Mrs. E. Keene and occupied as a lodg
ing house by Japanese, caught flre and
was completely destroyed, the occupants
losings all of their personal effects. The
flre was stopped. at that point, but had
there *een a breeze blowing there is lit
tle telling where it could have been
checked. -
It is estimated that the loss will not
exceed* $10,000. The cause of the flre has
not been learned, but it is believed that
a wooden â¢ ash barrel in the rear of th<Â»
Stern dwelling is responsible for it.
Otto Willweber, lessee of Saratoga Hall,
first noticed the fire shortly after 4
o'clock. At that time It was confined to
the rear of a three-story flat at 808, 80SA
and busB Geary street, owned by the
Misses Annie and Kate Butler and occu
pied by the families of Mrs. L. Bartlett,
William ilankowski and Jacob Stern
The flames were issuing from the lower
nat, which is occupied by Stern, and were
attacking the adjoining three-story frame
at Â£10, fclOA and blOB Geary street, owned
by J. Haskins, and occupied by Airs. K.
Bannger, Mrs. A. H. Aubin ana the Uni
versal Gas Saving Association. Saratoga
Hall occupies the upper portion of tne
building, extending from 812 to 818 Geary
street, and a masquerade ball was in
progress there when the flre broke out.
Wltn commendable presence of mind,
Willweber proceeded to get the masquer
aders out of the hall without creating
any alarm. He instructed the musicians
to strike up "Home, Sweet Home" and
to the strains oi that favorite ajr he hur
ried off the 'happy throng. The last one
of the merry party had reached the street
before' any of them knew that there was
any danger. The lire was in the rear of
the buildings and was not noticeable from
the street. While Willweber was engaged
in. clearing the hall the neighbors were
busy packing out their, personal belong
ings, none of them thinking to turn in an
alarm.
A fire that at one j time threatened - to
wipe out all of the buildings on the block
bounded by Geary, Post, Hyde and Lar
kin streets broke out shortly after 4
o'clock yesterday morning. There was a
delay of fully lif teen minutes before the
fire department was summoned. Had
there been a wind blowing at the time
it is very " probable that the flre â¢ would
have spread over a large district. A half
dozen buddings, including the Saratoga
Stables and Saratoga Hall on Geary
street, were burning fiercely before, tho
iirst stream of water was turned on. The
delay in reaching the tire was not due
10 any lacK. ot vigrllance on the part of
the tiretuen. The residents of the neigh
borhood were utterly bewildered and no
one seemed to know where to ttnd a lira
aiarm . signal station. When Fire Chief
butiivan ituchcu the ground in response
to the lirst alarm sounded at 4:21 o cIock
he ordered tnÂ« bounding of two addition
al alarms to unng to his aid all the ap
paratus available on a tew minutes' no
tice, a The lire was a stubborn one, and
notwithstanding the fact that half of the
entire hre tignung force of the city was
at work, it was three hours later when
the hrst companies tooK up their lines
and started tor home. ..

CIN'CINXATI. Ohio. Jan. 27.â Eugene
Zimmerman received a telegram from San.
Francisco to-night stating that his daugh
tc-r, the Duchess of Manchester, was very
111 there with diphtheria and other com
plications. Mr. Zimmerman said he did
not know at what hotel in San Francisco
his daughter and her husband are stay
ing, lie Eaid he would start to-morrow
evening for the bedside of the Duchess.
As a matter of fact, the Duke and
Duchess had originally planned to visit
.Monterey yesterday and their epecial car
had been sent to the station for them
early in the morning. Officials waited an I
wondered as the distinguished travelers
failed to appear. Finally a message was
sent to the Palace which elicited the re
ply that the excursion had beea aban
dor.ed.
Jt was the intention of the party to start
Hast on the Central and Union Pacific
to-Rigrht and go direct to Cincinnati, but,
of course, all arrangements have been
u;'set by the illness of the Duchess.
When the Duchess reached here on Sat
urday nieri-.t she was suffering from a
Ffvere cold, contracted on the long trip
overland. She was taken ill at dinner
Saturday night and compelled to go to
her room, to which she has been confined
since by orders of her physicians.
It looks now as though the pleasure trip
Â©f the Duke and Duchess of Manchester
will be brought to an abrupt end In this
city. The I>uchess la reported to be ill
xvith diphtheritic sore throat, and while
the Duke aenies that she is seriously il\
her lather has been telegraphed for and
Â¦will start for this city to-day.
At the Palace Hotel yesteraay every ef
fort was made to keep the knowledge of
the Illness of the Ducness from becoming
I>ub!ic.
"The Duke and Duchess are In Mon
terey,'" was the bulletin handed out to
inquirers In the early part of the day
1-ater on, however, this was changed to
ua admission that the Duchess was
e lightly ill. Repeated messages sent to
the apartments linally elicited the Icllow-
Iwr ar.swtr from the Duke:
"Although her grace Is ill. there is no
cautÂ« lor alarm. She is much better this
evening, lours sincerely,
