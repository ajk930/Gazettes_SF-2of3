VIENNA. Feb. 1Lâ Former King
Milan of â¢ Sen-la Is dead. He
passed a sleepless night and was
unable to take sufficient nourish
ment.
The remains Trill be interred at Kron
chol, a sacred monastic Bhrlne In Syrmia,
â¢Savonla, -with the honors due* to a mem- j
ber of the reigning dynasty. Last ;
Ing Milan received Adjutant Popvlas, who
had been sent by King Alexander. . The
Interview excited him somewhat, but he
recognized and talked with the adjutant.
From that time his strength failed rap
idly, and the difficulty of breathing ren
dered further conversation Impossible.
At noon to-day, he again received the
adjutant. He was then In full possession
of his faculties and .seemed to have no
Idea that his life was In danger. Con
sciousness was retained until within a
quarter of an hour of his death, ovhlch
came quietly in the presence of his uncle.
Colonel Constantlnevics, and his friend,
Count Zlchy.
Milan's illness began with -influenza. He
left his bed too quickly and the result was
pneumonia. The doctors. also found fatty
degeneration of the heart,' which was the
actual cause of death, as the danger Im
mediately arising from the lung trouble
had been overcome. Fearing a fatal Issue,
the doctors caused messages to be sent
King Alexander and' former Queen Nata
lie, but although Milan- desired , to see
them and himself sent messages request
ing their presence, neither came. Natalie's
reply, which was to the effect that, she
would come if her presence was really de
elred. reached him just before death.
Emperor Francis Joseph, who sent an
ald-de-camp to the deathbed, has ordered
a military funeral, as Milan was formerly
the colonel of an Austrian regiment. ." It
was Milan's written wish that- he. should
be burled at Synnia. He said he. had
been greatly disappointed at the absence
of his son, whose Ingratitude has. pro
voked much comment in Vienna. Accord-
Ing to the Neue Frele Presse he said to
his physician: "I feel that-I must die, but
It Is very Bad to be compelled to die at 47."
CAEEER OF KING MILAN.
At the royal palace at Topchldas, a
suburb of Belgrade, the Servian capital,
a remarkable picture Is shown to visitors/
It represents a tall, broad-shouldered
man, with a dark face, thick fclack beard,
black eyes and Jet black hair falling down
In a braid between his 'shoulders. * It Is
the picture of Milosh Obrenovich, swine
herd and brigand,' who freed Servia from
the Turkish yoke and became the founder
of the present dynasty. The tales told of
t^e cruelty of this semi-baYbarous Prince
are legion. He once learned that his
brother Yephrem had wronged a peasant
girl and the offender was sent for. "Open
your mouth!" commanded Milosh.
Tephrem obeyed. Milosh took a pistol
from his table, fired It into his brother's
mouth and Yephrem dropped dead.
Yephrem was the grandfather of the
late Milan^who succeeded Milosh on the
throne of Servia. Milan was educated at
Paris. He succeeded his greatuncle Mi
losh as ruler of Servia In lS68,""at the age
of 14. In 1S73, shortly before^.the Â¦war with
Turkey. MJIan visited Russia. At the city
of Kishlneff In Southern Russia he was
received with great honors. The Gover
nor gave a reception, which was attended
by all the nobility of the province, and it
was on that occasion that Milan first met
Natalie, .the charming and highly accom
plished daughter of Colonel . Koshko, a
rich officer of the imperial . army. Milan
had even then shown symptoms of the
reckless living that afterward was to ;be
his undoing. Natalie would, as the only
daughter of the colonel,, be entitled to a
large fortune, and by winning ; her hand
his coffers would be replenished. A Rus
sian alliance would* prove of value to him
also politically. * The courtship was ", a
brief one and the wedding a great event
in that part of Russia. The Czar and all
tho nobility took a deep interest In the
welfare of the pair, and the presents that
came pouring in were estimated at' twenty
million rubles in. value.. The newly wed
ded couple visited the principal cities of
Russia. and were met-with boundless en^
thiistasni'every where. "
Qi .. Wanted to .'Be ;Klng.' /. . ..
Soon after Milan's return to Belgrade
tho war against -Turkey commenced.
Thousands of young Russian students en
listed in the Servian army, Russian offi
cers volunteered to fight In the ranks and
In every Russian town money was col
lected for the Servian treasury. The first
success in arms was In favor of the
Servians, but disasters .followed one after
the other until finally the crushing defeat
of Slivltza, In which Alexander of Batten
berg carried off such laurels, caused the
Servians to beat an ignoble retreat.
In August, 1876, a son. Alexander, the
present King, was born to Milan and
Natalie.
Milan wanted to be elevated from a
Prince to a King, and for that purpose
sounded the Czar. He received little en
couragement, however, and in his disap
pointment sought the aid of Francis Jo
seph of /Austria. Here his efforts were
more successful.; /Austria lent her aid,
and in March, Â¦* 1882, he was proclaimed
King of Servia. During 'all these days,
however,' Milan was giving himself up to
dissipation.
Crown Prince Kidnapsd.
â¢In .1887 Natalie left Servia, taking her
son with' her. .She spent some time in the
Crimea, where v agents of, Milan endeav
ored to abduct -the Crown Prince. From
the I Crimea she Journeyed to , Italy and
thence to Wiesbaden. Here, at the com
mand of Bismarck, the German police
forcibly took Natalie's son from her and
turned -him" over. - to Milan's j agent, ; by
whom he was taken to Belgrade.
. In . October, 1884, Milan secured his di
vorce, but bis political troubles then com
menced in earnest. .'The Internal affairs of
the | kingdom were j in disorder and there
seemed no means of bettering things. The
King, perplexed* afraid, storm-tossed be
tween divided '^counsels, ; suddenly an
nounced his intention to abdicate in favor,
of his \ son.. ; After : kneeling : down before
Alexander and j swearing fidelity j to him
as a subject Milan betook himself off for
a tour | of where he could enjoy
himself, leaving'^ the little boy and his
guardians to extricate themselves from a
complicated position as best they could.
Three Regents were appointed and acted
until "Alexander attained his majority.:
A well known writer, ln*speaking- of the
character of Milan and how it was devel
oped, says: "His guardians sent him. to
school in Paris, to the Lycee Louis le
Grand, where neither.;' masters nor com
panions could assimilate with or hold in
check- the wild, obstinate boy from the
barbarian east. He .was , considered an
ill-tempered, : malicious, 'stubborn ' child,
not lacking withal in native - parts. In
Paris the boV all tod early came In con
tact with vice. -He was corrupted in mind
before ever - he . was , mature, this waif
thrown without guide into the waters of
life. An "orphan, 'it' was the greatmls
fw^tune of Milan's ? life that he was Â¦ en
tirely ; educated by men, } and these men
professional politicians. Of moral train
ing he received hone. Clever, not 111 read,
in * the main kind-hearted. '. King Milan
never '.learned >the elementary '; lessons of
self-control, purity and ./respect 7 for;'oth
ers." In short, it was a miserable training
he had andaccounis for. many of his fail-
Ings. He knew this hlpiself.* It isLtbld
that his Ministers . once respectfully
remonstrated with him for. some piece of
duplicity, upon which . Milan 'answered:
'Well, gentlemen. ' I : am . what 1 you have
made me.,; If you wanted a" higher moral-"
ity in your King: you should' have brought
:me v up otherwise.* 1 ." r :'Â£WffiMfflÂ£8il8i&Â§SB&w

BLOOD FLOWS
AT PRIMARIES
IN ST. LOUIS
Heelers Take a Hand
in a Battle at the
i Polls,
Sergeant of Police and Two
Otners Wounded During
a Lively Fusillade.
ST. LOUIS. Feb. U.â Repeaters Import
ed from Chicago to aid rival factions in
the Democratic primary election had a
hand in a lively shooting affray early this
evening.
More than ISO shots were fired, a ser
geant of police and two negroes were
wounded, and a ballet box was stolen in
the course of a riot about the Second Dis
trict polling place of the Fourth "Ward, at
Twelfth and Linden streets.
It was only after a riot call had brought
Captain Kleley with forty police and riot
guns to the scene that a semblance of
order was restored. Even then the streets
were filled with nesrroes and some white
men, all of whom were armed, many of
them Intoxicated and looking for trouble.
Not a ballot was cast there during the
eay.
The wounded were:
SERGEAXT QUIXLIVAX of the
Fourth District, thot In the leg.
GEORGE MONROE, shot in the arm.
FRED JONES, shot in the leg.
The trouble had been brewing all the
afternoon. The Tinker judges disagreed
with the Wells men as to the advisability
of opening the bark door of the polling
place. One claimed that the other had a
host of heelers in waiting, and If the
Coot wore opened these men would press
In to cause confusion and prevent their
exponents from noting. A third faction
asserted that both the other factions
Â¦were Jockeying to prevent any voting
whatever, because, they said, the ward
was overwhelmingly for their leader.
Koonaa. The Judges, being unable to
agree, no voting was done. Finally a
*hot was f.red, supposedly from the re
volver of Arthur Gardiner, a negro.
As coon as the phot rang out the street j
eboukthe polling place became the scene
of a fusillade. Every man drew one or
two revolvers. Judge John Ryan ran
out into the street and shot squarely at
si negro advancing upon ths booth, gun
in hand. The police under Sergeant Quln
livan rushed upon the bolder rioters, at
tempting to disarm them.
It was while he was arresting George
Monroe, who had resisted the attempt to
disarm him. that Sergeant Quinlivan was
shot. Detective McGrath ran to his as
f-'stance. disarmed the negro, and in the
midst of a scattering fire wrapped a
handkerchief about the sergeant's wound
ed leg: to stop the flow of blood from a
severed artery.
Ten policemen were on the spot within
a few moments and succeeded In quelling
the riot and dispersing the 200 negroes
â¢*ho had figured most prominently In the
a!Tray.
After order had been restored it was
found that the ballot box had been stolen.
Every judge and clerk had been at the
windows or front door, holding the fort.
Some one had slipped in the back way
end taken the box from behind them.
The up? hot was that no votes were polled
to-day in the Second District of the
Tourth Ward.
B.EPEATERS ARE AHBESTED.
St. Louis Police Gather in Twenty-
Five Men Imported From Chicago.
ST. LOCIS. Feb. 11.â The Post-Dispatch
rays: Twenty-five men, who say they
are from Chicago, were arrested to-day
on suspicion that they were brought to
St. Louis to be used as repeaters In the
Democratic primary election.
Information reached the police Sunday
night through David Perry, a saloon keep
er, that a large party of men had left
that city for Et Louis with the expressed
Intention of taking part in the primaries
here. According to the terms of their
egxeement. so the police were Informed,
the men were paid $100 each before the
train left Chicago and were to receive
2200 more at the conclusion of their day's
work.
Upon the opening of the primaries, It
1* said, they were to be supplied with
grana and ammunition. Their Instructions,
the police declare, were to vqte at I the
primaries as often as told to do bo, and
to use force with anybody who Interfered
with them, whether police, election offi
cials or party workers.
The police say the arrangements for
bringing the men to St. Louis were made
by two candidates for nomination to tne
House of Delegates. Acting upon the ad
vice of .the Chicago saloon keeper, the en
tire detective force of the Police Depart
ment was sent out to locate the men this
morning, resulting In the arrest of twen
ty-five of the supposed gang. The photo
graphs of some of the men are said to
adorn the collection of the National Iden
tification Bureau.

spent the .afternoon yesterday 'in' the
grounds of the palace. The Countess.' did
not leave the palace precincts.
In an interview to-day Senor Sagasta,
the Liberal leader, said he disapproved, of
the noisy demonstrations,. but recognized
that they were -the outcome of the exist
ing situation, which .was. aggravated by
the Ubao affair. He thought the presence
of Count Caserta in Madrid was unneces
sary and that he ought not to have come
to the marriage, as he might have fore
seen his presence | would create trouble.
Senor Sagasta severely Â¦ condemned the
brutality of the police, declaring that no
law authorized the Government to order
the police to club the crowds, even though
they raised subversive cries. The offend
ers ought to be arrested, he said.
"The Government." added Senor Sagas
ta, "hopes the agitatiqn will cease the day
rof the wedding, but I doubt it. A car
nival is often the occasion for disorders.
I am astonished that many people do not
attach importance to these events. It is
impossible to foresee what" the future has
in store*. We know how events begin, but
we never know how they will end."
The Imparclal says that a lieutenant
and two soldiers were among the persons
arrested yesterday. The lieutenant was
immediately released, amid cheers for the
army.
The disturbances of -last night, which
were more menacing than those previous-;

The second bill takes effect at the next

the general appropriation bill and pre
scribing the duties of the Controller ana
Treasurer in relation thereto." The terms
of the bill are as follows:
Section 1. In addition to all other sums of
money or funds provided for the aupport and
maintenance of the University of Cali;ornia
and for the purpose of making a permanent
and continuous provision for the funds of the
University of California., there Is hereby ap
propriated out of any money ln the State

endowment caused by the loss of a U~.

The endowment from Congress was given
on condition that any losses of the en

likely to become a loss. Should it be so.

Assembly BÂ«fers to , the Judiciary
Regarding the expenditure of the money
it Is generally believed that what the re
port will say will hurt no one. Should
there be a minority report, it will surely
deal principally with that subject, but if
the reports be based upon the testimony
given they can find no more. to say than
that a lot of money was spent, a fact
which no one denies. The testimony was
to the effect that the entertainment at
the headquarters was most lavish, and
there it branched off. some witnesses de
claring that the money was well spent,
others that too much was spent, but no
one willing to say any found its wayinto
the pockets of the commission. There
may oe some comment on the vouchers as
being too general, but there was no testi
mony that directly impeached the finan
cial policy of the commission.
It is the expectation of the members of
the committee that there will be but one
report, and as the minority, consisting
principally of Melick, is a persistent one,
it is safe to assiime that most of. what
he has to eay will go into the general
report, should there be but one, in a mod
ified form. Otherwise there will be two
reports for the Assembly, to choose from.
The report of the committee will be
submitted on Wednesday,. If possible, -and
if not. then on Thursday.

MENTO, Feb. 11.â There was a meeting
of 'the Assembly Committee on Commis
sions and Public Expenditures this after
noon, the principal object of which was
to consider the proposed report on the
Paris Commission, which the committee
has had on the grill for two weeks past.
No decision was reached, but the comfnlt
tee went far enough to agree that no part
of the report should â¢ get out until the
whole had been submitted to the Assem
bly. There Is considerable speculation as
to the nature of the report, and a good,
deal of this is not far wrong.
The members of the committee are more
than anxious to avoid a minority report,
and -with that end in view a course be
tween a whitewash and a not roast Is
probable, with a page or so of censure for
Eralay, to whom everything was
passed up. Â¦-V~'-':
The commission Â¦will receive censure for
knowing so little and caring not at all
about tne doings and misdeeas of its sub
ordinates an*d attaches. Gasklll will come
in for a good deal of this, find also for
allowing the name of the commission to
be used in obtaining contracts for Eralay
and for passing tne matter of medals
over to a auborolnate and giving the sub
ject no further thoucht.
Emlay, according to the testimony,
was the most vulnerable of the witnesses
examined, and the most peculiar part of
the whole investigation was the almost
absolute ignorance of the commission and
its secretary regarding what Emlav was
doing. In the committee's report Emlay
will hear of. the contracts he made, in
which he was to receive compensation for
caring for exhibits when he was paid a
good salary by the commission for devot
ing all of his time to just that work. He
will also hear a good deal about medals,
for the committee has been looking up
that subject since the taking of testi
mony was closed and it has been found
that Lathoud's medals were only unau
thorized copies of the official medals de
signed for the use of exhibitors who had
been awarded official medals in the first
place and wished to expose their prize
goods with the medals they had won in
several places at once. ,

A 147.000 loan was made to William C.
Turner of Merced In 1SSD, and some valu
able property In Merced County was taken
as security. Turner, was Â¦ a rich man and
the property was ample to secure the
mortgage. Turner died, in 1894, and when
his estate went to probate and the sale
by the executor the University Regents
bid in the property, considering it a safe
investment. They had submitted their
note as a claim upon the estate, and in
the claim they had mentioned that the
note was secured by a mortgage, but they
did not mention the place where the mort
gage was recorded, a technical' defect,
which barred them from offering the can
celed note as payment for the property
they had. bid in. The matter was brought
into court, and the question of exchang
ing the note without mention of the place
of recordatlon of the mortgage for the bid
was submitted and passed upon adversely
as being a bad precedent. , â¢
-The foreclosure of the note is "now in
the courts. It is properly secured' by
mortgage, but in .view of the death of the
fnortgagee the defective note is limited to
the property actually mortgaged. -. .There
has been some' depreciation in country
lands since the mortgage was made, and
it- was feared that when the foreclosure
proceedings had terminated ; the land
would not bring quite the- face value of
the mortgage. As the State Is bound to
make good any deficiency In the perpetual
endowment, it was deemed best . to Â¦ set
aside $50,000 of the money to be appro
priated for the satisfaction of the whole
mortgage, eo that there should.be no
chance of the endowment fund remaining
deficient in the smallest degree until the
next session of the Legislature, when the
deficiency could be made good. The meas
ure Introduced by Lukens Is ipurely pre
cautionary," for it is the opinion" of those
behind the bill that the land will bring
every cent^of the mortgage, and there
will be no necessity for using in that way
the funds , r . ;
The Turner, estate Is' a big one and
should make good any deficiency.' and
there is legal â¢ advice to the effect that a
suit for any balance, due on', the note
would be successful. The $50,000 mentioned
is the same amount intended as addition
al to . the $20,000 originally decided upon.
The bill, while appropriating it, makes it
Immediately available for the endowment
fund, should the need arise.

bara-Kern road came up Ralston spoke In
opposition. He said the Ways and Means
Committee had been asked to act': upon
a measure carrying an appropriation of
$85,000, without any definite information.
No man of wealth would invest auch in
amount upon the information supplied the
committeeor the Assembly. No definite
plans had been submitted: no one know
what sort of a road was to be built. It
was simply "a road." and when the.com
mittee asked what the road's purpose was
it was informed that. the road was to be
built to enable the farmers of the interior
to eet to the coast for a breath of fresh
air.
Fisk said he wanted to go on rÂ«cord as
against the bill, although the Ways and
Means Committee had sent in a favorable
maiority report.
llerritt said the proposition was not a
new one and was quite generally under
stood. It was a matter of vital import
ance to the people of tnat portion or the
State. Kern County had already built
forty miles of the road, and Santa Bar
bara nine miles from its side of the moun
tains. , Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
"Of all the bills I for State highways,*'
Broughton said, . "I believe that -- not
another one has the merit Â¦Â¦. of this. . it
means the opening up of a rich , interior,
giving it an outlet to the seaboard. The
proposes road runs through a mountainous
country, and in the. nature of conditions
existing the counties could never con
struct it" â¢-;â¢ .
Carter spoke for the bill, as did Greer.
The latter said the proposed road crossed
a Government reservation; and for that
additional reason could not be built except
by State aid.

From the Senate-
The Senate bill passed the Assembly
without opposition, but Ralston will be
able- to muster considerable strength, and
mar be able to obtain the bill's recall un
til nom* direct assurance be given as to
Colonel Heuer' s attitude. Â¦-â¢
Acting on this unofficial communication
from an officer no longer connected with
the Debris Commission, .Ralston hurriedly
got together a committee meeting. Dur
yea, Rutherford, Uubbard and Laird were
all absent. Ralston read Mansfield's let
ter and gave notice that whatever the
committee's action might be he would
offer a resolution asking the bill's recall.
Then lie moved that such resolution be
offered by the committee. Irish reminded
him that as chairman he could not make
a motion. Ray accommodatingly made
Ralpton's motion for him and Chandler
It.
"This action is entirely unjust to me
as the author of the bill." Irish said, "and
to the crÂ«nmittee. I was shown this let
ter, but I was not told that this was the
purpose of the meeting. If I had been I
would not be here to make up a quorum.
Our chairman calls a meeting when he
knows the members who have been favor
able to the bill are out of the city and
ba-ses his request for a reconsideration on
the letter of an engineer, who has not
been connected with the Debris Commis
sion for four months. Colonel Heuer 1s
at present chairman of the commission.
He said to me and he said to the miners*
committee that he would recommend that
no expenditure be made until this addi
tional State appropriation should be made.
"I say further than any assertions ot
misrepresentation are untrue. - ' Colonel
Heuer has been reported as saying these
things and his statements have not been
misrepresented."
Irish snok*> with much heat, and after
the motion was carried by the votes of
Ralston, Chandler. Ray and Stewart of
Amador against his own. he lpft the room
asserting that the action of Ralston an<l
hi? supporters was a cowardly one. taking
a mean advantage of the absence of the
friend* cf the bill.
Colonel Heuer' s letter of January 25. 190L

Secondâ Will your commission proceed to ex
pend thiÂ» $500,000 if it is available, or will you
recommend to the department that it be not
used unUl the full tSOO.OOO is appropriated?
In answ.-rinc. I have to say that I severed
my active connection with the * California
Debris Commission when ordered relieved of
my duties in Â£an Francisco the 23d of Novem*
bcr laÂ«t. Prior to that date the commission
considered that the U0Q.000 appropriated vai
available, but subject to approval of plans and
specification* by the State Board of Examiner*.
as provided by State laws, and the commission
intended to proceed actively with the work to
th* extent of JOOO.OdO, with no thought of
recommending: that it be not used until the
full tSOO.000 is appropriated.
This consideration and tnterxi^n was based
upon the item "Land for debris, dame and lm
pounain* works in California." in the emerg
ency river and harbor act of June 6. 1800 (pub
lic No. 1C).
The question now hinges on' whether
Colonel Heuer will recommend to the
United States Government that no work
be done on the impounding system until
the entire JSOO.000 of the estimated cost b*
available. A number of prominent miners
assured Ralston that Heuer had so in
formed them. Assemblyman Irish ha-i
been given the same assurance. This
.morning Ralston received a letter from
Colonel Mansfield which Rives the Assem
blyman the ground for his contention that
such is not the case and that he was
given mistaken Information. The letter
Is as follows : :+

NEW YORK, Feb. 1Lâ More than 375
members of the Silk Association of Amer
ica and their guests sat down to the
twenty-ninth anniversary banquet of the
association at Delmonico's to-night. The
conspicuous guest of the evening was the
Chinese Minister, Wu Ting Fang.
Senator Thurston of Nebraska spoke to
the toast, â¢"The Great Republic In the
New Century." and Senator Galllnger of
New Hampshire spoke to the toast, "The
Congress of the United States in Its Re
lations to the Silk Industry."
The Japanese Minister. Kogroro Taka
hlra. was introduced to respond to the
toast. "Japan and Her Estimation of
America and American Ideas."
The Japanese Minister, began to read
his speech in a very loudV voice, which
commanded attention by its tone, but be
fore he had read far heÂ»pot down to a
sing-song tone, that caused a majority
of the diners to forget the speech and
talk among themselves. , Half a dozen
times they talked and laughed so loudly
that General Conger had to rap for at
tention. Then the Minister would break
out of his elng-song style and read a few
sentences in a clearer tone, but would
soon become almost Inaudible. The talk-
Ing and laughter continued and the
speaker finally threw down his paper on
the table, folded his hands in front of
him. and closing his eyes stood silent. For
a pecond there was QUletnes=*i. This was
broken by a call for cheers for the Japa
nese Minister. They were given with
great vigor, but the recipient was vexed
and flung his paper down on the iloor. â¢
Senator Galllnger picked up the paper
and handed it to the Minister, who -was
persuaded to start again. He soon re
lapsed into the sing-song style and the
talking and laughter began again. There
upon the Minister flung the paper down
on the table, and resuming his seat would
not finish. Then many of the diners came
up to him and congratulated him on his
effort, somewhat mollifying him.

The King- of Portugal's departure last

greater weight by the publication yester
day of a delayed telegram saying that
the Portuguese were co-operating with
the English to prevent the landing of war
material for the Boers.
There ls absolutely no doubt that news
has reached here from German Â¦ sources
showing that the Boers are pretty well
at their last stand. The continued harass-
Ing, and the development of Lord Kitch

well nigh hopeless condition. This view

Special Dispatch to The Call
The official denial of the pardoning of
Mrs. Maybrick would have been issued
earlier but for the red tape rule of 'the
Home Offlce. which alone of all the
British Government department requires
that press inquiries shall be made In
writing and answered through the mails.
The only exception known was made thl*
afternoon for the beneflt of the Associated
Press. . After this was done the officials
freely said the Maybrick story was on a
par with tbe recent epidemic of "fakes'
published in the United States. amon<
them being: the statement that King Ed
ward is suffering from cancer: that there
wa3 friction between Lord Salisbury and
King Edward, and that General Sir
Evelyn Wood was going to South Africa
as peace commissioner, etc. The Mav
brlck report was circulated freely here
Sunday, and Mr. Choate, the United
States Embassador. told its authors last
night that It was untrue. .But this evi
dently had no weight with them, -and
when it was published nothing remained
but to wait until the Home Office made up
its mind to break through tradition and
give the quietus to "the latest of the utter
ly baseless reports.
"It <lld not need tho Home Offlce denial
to prove the absolute baselessness of the
Maybrick story. We rvould be the first to
be notified of any such action or proposed
action by the British Government. Xot a
single fact has arisen to give the slightest
justification for the story or to make the
release of. Mrs. Maybrick more probable
than heretofore."

ment to pardon Mrs. Florence MaybrlcK,

Ohoate has lost no opnortunitv- at all
proper times, to work toward that end,
and it Is understood that his efforts have
been particularly energetic of late. Of
course, these efforts must be unofficial,
for It would not bÂ« permissible for the
case to be made the subject of formal ex

dor to IÂ»ndon. did all that ho could In

however, that he is working under much
more favorable auspices and that success
is near at hand.

by the House Committee to-day relative
to the allegation he made at a hearing
last week that $1,000,000 had been set aside
on the books of the New England Gas
and Coke Company for legislative pur
poses, and also that securities of a doubt
ful nature had been sold to banks in this
State. Mr. McPherson repeated his
charges, somewhat modified.
Thomas W. Lawson tes titled that ilc-

Mr. Lawtoh said that he heard that
Henrv M Whitney, president of the gas

to stop persecuting the coke company.
"One of the directors," said Mr. Law
son "told me that the money had been
so voted and that he had been made one
of a committee to see that I got it."
Mr Lawson refused to give the name
of the director who had given him this

One reason why business men In this
city generally believe that the great steel
deal is nearing a consummation. of some
kind Is the announcement that J. P. Mor
gan is planning to close up everything. in
the-next ten days and take his annual
vacation -trip.
It is also said that the American Bridge
Company will in Some way enter into the
new arrangement and that an agreement
will' be arranged with the Phoenix Bridge
Company, the only one outside of. the
bridge combination, . as to prices for five
years. Trade understanding will also be
arranged, it Is rumored, with the Cam
bria, Bethlehem. Pennsylvania and Lack
awanna Steel Company in respect to
prices of ; rails. Jn addition to the
question of the companies to be In
cluded and the methods of financing,
there ls to bfc considered the problems
growing out of legislation in the various
States in which the defendant properties
are located, and every, effort will be made
by those interested to harmonize the deal
with the widely different laws of the va
rious States. According to one Wall street
bulletin, no mammoth "trust" or "billion
dollar combination" is contemplated. The
propositions as discussed Id financial cir
cles appear, to hinge around one central
company as a controlling company.
One Wall street rumor to-day was to
the effect that John W. Gates contem
plated retiring from the management of
the American Steel and Wire ; Company
within the near future. "Â«
One of the rumors growing out of the
movements of tho steel magnates was to
the effect that a sale of the Carnegie
Company was not contemplated, but that
rather a division of territory was planned
on a pooling basis, and that peace' nego
tiations between the great steel compa
nies was what was really aimed at. On
this subject there is no information avail
able save the recent- statement from ex-
Judge Gary, president of the Federal
Steel Company, who gave out a typewrit
ten statement to the effect that J. P. Mor
gan & Co. are considering plans for the
acquisition of some of the largest iron and
steel companies of this country. The
point of interest at the present time ap
pears to be whether a pool or a great steel
combination is in contemplation. Accord-
Ing to the latest Wall street story, Mr.
Carnegie is to take from the syndicate
which is to purchase his stock collateral
trust notes with a guarantee of certain
dividends not yet agreed upon. The stock,
so the rumor goes. Is to be deposited and
the dividends are to be left to accumulate
to pay for the stock. These interests buy
ing the Carnegie stocks are, it is claimed,
also, to purchase interest in certain other
companies, though it ls not clear as yet
what these companies are. It Is generally
believed, however, that as the deal pro
gresses among the number will be the
Federal Steel. Steel and Wire, National
Tube and National Steel. According to
one story, the stock of these companies
will be deposited with the three trustees
who will hold the stock in trust as a
guarantee that the terms of agreement
will ..be lived up to, certain forfeiture
clauses being provided.
NEW YORK, Feb. 1Lâ The â¢ arrival of
Henry C. Frlck in this city to-day started
the gossips in Wall street discussing fresh
steel trade negotiations and the' prospects
of bringing them to an early and satis
factory conclusion. â¢ Mr. Frlck was re
ported to have had conferences with Bev
eral persona interested In railroads, Iron
mines and steel mills, but no positive offi
cial information could be had even on this
subject. J. P. Morgan himself, when seen,
reiterated with some emphasis that he
had nothing to say, and that when he did
have anything to say he could be relied
upon to say it. '

WAR WITH BOERS
PRACTICALLY OVER
. The nominations of the many junior of- i
fleers of the army under the reorganiza

Senate at the end of the present week.
The applications are in the ratio of at
least ten to one, compared 4 with the posi
tions. The War Department has found it
It Is understood there will be a change
in the order in which the nominations
Â¦were made, which will relieve them of the
criticism that was made on account of
the high relative position the original as
signments gave certain officers.
During the afternoon' there was a hur
ried meeting of the committee, at which
a favorable report upon all the brigadier
nominations before the committee were
acted upon and at the second closed ses
sion of the Senate they were all reported.
These favorable recommendations include
not only the nominations heretofore re
ported but also the nominations of Gen
erals Wood, Grant and Bell, which had
been previously passed over, and also
those of General Fitzhugh Lee and James
H. Wilson, whose names were sent to the
Senate to-day. When the nominations
were reported Senator Pettigrew objected
to favorable consideration, and they went
over until to-morrow under the Â« Senate
rules.
The Senate held two brief executive ses
sions to-day. for the consideration of the
nominations of the offlce of brigadier gen
eral sent in by the President under the
army reorganization act. At the first ses
sion the nominations which had been fa
vorably commented upon were committed
to the Committee on Military Affairs.

they represent practically thÂ© whole of
the more responsible element of Porto
Rico's commerce and Industries. Although
the bill to which they object was passed
by a Legislature elected by the Porto

contend that its provisions- raising an an
nual Income of the S2.000.000 needed for the
Island's administration are so placed as
to make an unsupportable burden upon

LIVELY DEBATE
IN THE HOUSE
no fdea. preva:i*Â»d that in the seventeen |
rtays of Â»h#Â» session r^mairJng, the bill, a ;
fienate measure, which would have to be j
pushed bv the House to become a law, )
o<-.u!d be- disposed of. He regarded it "ab
surd" that any thought of passing 'the
measure at this session Should be enter
tain*^. He then moved that the Judiciary
Committee be discharged from, considera
tion cf the anti-trust bill passed by the
House and that the Senate proceed "to Its
consideration.
Pending that motion, "Wolcott of Colo
rado said he folt it his duty to say in
r*ply to Mr. Jor.es' statement that at this
time in the session many Senators were
â¢ bliped to absent themselves from the
Senate chamber in order to attend to lm
;ortant committee work. Their absence
did not at all indicate an indifference as
to the shipping bill.
Upon objection by Chandler, the motion
of Jnn^-s. under the rules, went over until
to-morrow, the Arkansas Senator giving
rotice that he would press It at that time
If he could do so without antagonizing the
appropriation bills.
Platt of Connecticut explained that the
Judiciary Committee for several days had
had the anti-trust bill under considera
tion and he protested that the committee
should not be discharged summarily
from its work.
During Mr. Caffery's speech the Senate
was called several times to produce a
c-jorum. Finally, at the conclusion of one
' f the calls. Frye. chairman of the Com
mittee on Commerce, said:
"The Commerce Committee has permis
sion of the Senate to si: during sessions
of the Scnaf. Jf Senators desire to have
.-â¢- river and harbor bill at this session it
may not be possible for the committee to
report it '.f it is continually interrupted by
the calls of the Sonate."
"In "order to aid the committee," sug
gested Jones facetiously, "it might be well
for the Senate to take a recess while the
committee is in session."
Caffery's speech was further Interrupted
by a brief executive .session and the pas
page of a resolution offered by Spooner
calling upon the Secretary of the Treas
ury to furnish the Senate the number and
tonnage of vessels engaged in foreign
commerce, number now engaged in the
coastwise trade that could enter the for
eign trade under the pending bill and also
the amount of subsidy each vessel would
receive under the bill. The resolution also
calls for the number of foreign built ves
sels authorized to come under American
r^pistry by the bill and the, amount of
subsidy each would receive and the num
ber of foreign ships registered as con
tracted to be built under .the provisions of
the bills.
Senators Allison. Aldrlch and Jones of
Arkansas were appointed conferees on the
revenue bill. â¢ *,.-J
Resuming, Caffery declared that the b!ll
"is a bald, bold grant of the people's
money to till the pockets of shipbuilders
and ship owners. As such it is absolutely
unconstitutional and void. It Ls robbery
Tinder the form of law. You can tax the
people for a public purpose, but you can
not give away the people's money for a
jirivate purpose."
Before Caffery concluded, the Senate at
E:!E> p. m. went into executive session and
at 6 o'clock adjourned.
nbnut the accuracy of Tillman' s state
ment.
Pettigrew said that when a member of
'â¢ne of the armor plate concerns was be
fore the Appropriations Committee, he ad
mitted that the Carnepie and Bethlehem
companies had an apretment to bid the
samÂ« fam for the armor.
TiJlman declared that the hjgli price
named in the contract for armor was rixed
as an Inducement to the Carnegie and
Bethlehem companies to make a large
contribution to the Republican campaign
fund. The bill was passed without divi
sion.
Hanna then moved to take up the ship-
Ting- bill. The motion prevailed by a vote
of S3 to 14.
Caffery of Louisiana addressed the Sen
ate in opposition to the bill, declaring It
Â¦would not promote the commerce and In
crease the for<*5|rn trade of the United
States, as Its t'.iie proclaimed, but was
really def!jrrje<1 :o furnish a donation to
certain pteamship lines. He believed that
ro new lines would spring: into existence
Â¦under the bill, as the entire subsidy would
be absorbed by the present Mines. He
Thought the bill : unconstitutional, and
dwelt at ler.gth en the large amount of
subsidy it pave to high speed Ehlps.
Caffery asserted that there was nothing
in the pending bill that would be of ad
vantage to American seamen.
Hanr.a interposed to say that one of the
objects pubserved by The bill would be the
Increased number of places afforded to
pÂ« amen upon American vessels. He point
ed out that Th* waees paid by vessels
under the American flag were Just about
t^ice as larpe as those paid under any
other flap, and under the provisions of
this bill American ship owners would be
able to ray such wages and at the same
t!me nr-n foreign competition in the car
rying trarie.
Jonr-s of Arkansas interrupted, suggest
ing th<? absence of a Quorum.
The rol! call disclosed the presence of
fifty-Fix Senators. Jones of Arkansas
thought therp must be some good r**ai?on
for the "manifest indifference" of so
large a part c{ the Republican Senators
to this bill. In his opinion the reason
for the '"mnnifeFt Indifference" was that
Illinois was passed.
The r.ava! n rproprtatlon bill vr&s then
taken up. Tillman of South Carolina had
â¢ xpected to discuss the armor plate ques
:i<-,n, which was before the Senate when
the Mil was laid aside on Saturday. He
?a!d he de-Fired to present evidence which
mold show the bad faith with which the
â¢^ampjrie nnd Bethlehem companies had
treated the Government. The companies
l;sd said positively that they were unable
to ir.ake Krupp crmorfor less than 5545 per
ton. fet they had entered into a contract
for r.rmor at a lower price. He would be

Freshmen Beaten in Interclass Base-
LOSE TO THE SOPHOMORES,
ball at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 11.â In
a game rife with errors the sophomore
team defeated the freshmen at baseball
this afternoon by a score of 11 to 6. Both
teams showed a lack of practice, 'which
became less- evident as the game pro
gressed. The second year men had the
advantage of having in their ltne-up the
varsity battery. Parker and Traeger, who
did much toward keeping the. freshmen
from reaching the Initial bag.
To-morrow the Junior-senior match will
be played and on Friday the sophomores
will meet the winners for the class cham
pionship.

CHRISTIE HAS
GOOD OPINION
OF BERKELEY
Another bloody chapter has been added
to tho Waldron-Walker tragedy. ., When
William Walker, with blood streaming
from a 'dozen wounds, staggered Into the
Coronado saloon, at tho corner of Ellis
and Powell streets, last night he had paid
a dozenfold for his assault on Mllo Wald
ron, the saloon -'man jÂ» whom he cut ana
wounded in the throat at the Palmerlee
on November- 18 of last year In a quarrel
over a woman. â¢ ,. ' â¢ -
Walker when he became sober was
heartily sorry .for his attack on Waldron.
He paid for the doctor and for a barkeep
er to work In the wounded man's place
until he recovered, and when the case
came up in court it was dismissed by
mutual consent. The matter passed ovei
and the whole thing was almost forgot
ten by the friends of both men. '
Milo> Waldrdn did not forget nor '<Â£&Â£*
however: Last evening he "?et "Walker
for the first time since their trouble.
Walker was leisurely strolling down Ellis
street about 7:30 o'clock/when Waldron
saw him from across the street and rush-
Ing up behind him stabbed him In tne
neck. Walker turned around to face nis
assailant and Waldron, with brutal venge
ance, slashed his keen b.ade across W alK
er's face, cutting the left eye %o' severely
'that It lay exposed on his cheek. Waldron
stabbed his victim several times more and
then took to his heels.
Walker presented a terrible spectacle as
with blood flowing from a half-dozen
wounds he groped hjs way Into the Coro
nado, where he was in the habit of spend
ing: his leisuro time. As soon as he was
recognized a coupe was called and the
wounded man was taken to the French
Hospital. At a late hour Walker was in
a very low condition, and the doctors hem
out little hope for h.is recoverey.
Where * Waldron went nobody seems to
know.* but the wise ones say that it will
be a bad day for him should Walker re
cover and leave the hospital. They claim
that the first thing that' he would do
would be to secure a gun and start out
to kill Milo Waldron.
The trouble between the men first com
menced over a woman by the name of
Mabel, whom Walker brought up from
Los Angeles about six months ago. The
woman was in the habit of frequenting
the Majestic saloon* in which Waldron at
that time owned an Interest. Mt 13 claimed
that Waldron became infatuated with the
woman and bad blood sprang up between
the two men, who had up to that time
been, friends. The trouble culminated
when Walker found Waldron in the wom
an's room at the Palmerlee and stabbea
him In ths neck.

By F. E. Mulholland.
While the attendance at Oakland yes
terday rhowed the ravages of tho con
flict now being waged between the rival
racing associations, it scorned to be sat
isfactory to the management of the track
across the bay. Fully 12*) people were
ur-e-scnt, the fair sex being liberally rep
resented, nnd though thÂ« betting was by
no means n>rc<\ it was good. Mr. Cald
wcJI'f starting has not pWen entire satis
faction, and at U10 conclusion of the
s=l>ort President Williams announced that
"Jake'* Holtman would replace the vet
eran on Thursday next. Holtman. who is
i*<vpnized as having no peer among the
planers of America, left Hot Springs yes
ttniay for this city. .
. In addition to the regulars, a gay
pa.thorln.ff of poc-lcty folks chatting on the
verandas of the clubhouse or strolling:
about on the lawn lent additional color to
reopening day. Among those present were

The night ' before. In glancing over tho
entries, it looked like a favorite day;
still Sea Lion was the only winning
rhoio\ Even Yellowtail, highly touted as
he was. rar. third. The track was well
harrowr-d up. which accounted for tho
slow time niadc
Ruiz had the mount on St. Rica, fav
orite for the introductory sprint, but
mad? his run too lite, and was beaten by
I>unfree. The winner rulrvi second choice
in the ring, piloted by Clem Jenkins.
Even with the poor break received,
from the way he ran Socialist had no
chance to take the second number. Bull
man had the leg up, and a 7 to 5 favorite
was unaM<Â» to land thÂ«* poldinp inside the

After the rain, the fogs and unsettled
weather of last week, the bright, warm
sunshine was welcomed at Tanforan yes
terday by a regulation crowd of race
goers.
The attendance was fairly good, the bet
ting ordinarily brisk and the card an in
teresting one.
Â«^i e w en re eular books cut in and two
new books were operated. William Shan
non, t^ie Melbourne Club, Eckert & Co.,
Harlan & Co., the Virginia Club, Jack
man, tho Lurline Club, the Yukon Club,
â¢ t. GtUnes> Joe Rose and the st - Lou's
Club handled the big money, the Tanforan
and Joe Harvey operating the Held
books. Judging from the long sheets the
books were kept' busy by a crowd that
Se ~ mcd to en JÂ°y the chances offered.
/The handicap, a mile event for "3-year
olds, was the race of the day and was
won by Joe Froy, with Tod Sloan up.
T". 18 . 18 the first winning J. Todhunter has
put to his credit since his return to Call
? ,?' * Vhen he rode up to the- Judge's
stand after the race the jockey packed a
series of smiles on his face larger than
the biggest of the big cigars he habitually
smokes. He will race regularly from, now
OI k just as in merry old England."
*Tom the start Sloan jumped out and
never lost his lead. Pupil, with Buchanan
up, was within shouting distance until
the stretch was reached and then Ad
vance Guard, Winnie O'Connor in the sad
dle, began to show evil intentions.
The "van defender" came thundering
down the stretch, but the wire wasn't far
enough away to overtake Frey, who won
by a full length. Gonfalon, the second
choice, was a trailing disappointment.
This good horse finished fifth. There were
hvÂ© horses in the race.
The third race resulted in a dead heat
between Alary's Garter and Genua. This
Garter was thought to be a cinch, but it
wasn't. At tho stretch Genua was more
than a length behind and then began a
nip and tuck driving race for the wire.
Genua gained Inch by inch as they tore
down the stretch. There were some that
thought Garter gave signs of a victory
by an abbreviated nose, but the judges
called it a dead heat. C. H. Harrison Jr.,
favorite in the betting for a short time,
was handicapped by the length of his
mayoralty name. The owners of the
Garter and Genua divided the purse.
The second race, three furlongs for two
year-olds, was captured by Rory Ough,
the favorite, in easy fashion. Minerva,
one of the outsiders, opening at 30 to 1,
got the place. Legal Maxim. O'Connor
up. was second choice, but Minerva and
Maraschino punched holes in primal legal
principles for the place and show.
Toah, a 5 to 2 favorite, won the first
race. Vantine. with Tommy Burns in the
saddle, was strong until the stretch was
hoofed. Then Edinborough, at that time
In the lead, and Vantine, a close second,
were passed by Donator, who got the
place.
Henry rode Free Lance, finishing ahead
of Rey del Bandidos and Locochee in the
fifth race, mile and an eighth selling. The
three took up their respective finishing
places at the half-mile and kept them till
the end in a driving finish.
The last race, mile selling, was a pro
cession over the back stretch with Parme
nlon leading La Borgia. Buchanan, on
the Burlingame Farm's entry, passed
Parmenion at the stretch and won out
after a driving race.

ERKELEY, Feb. 11.â Trainer
Walter Christie will commence
light work with the University
of California track men to-mor
row. He was on the campus this
, - afternoon looking at the facili
ties for training the athletes and watch
ing them at their work. His first ap
pearance on the diamond was to umpire
the Junior-sophomore baseball game at 4
o'clock. Many of the best athletes are
already known to him, as he met them
while they were East last year.
Christie Is enthusiastic over the Cali
fornia athletes and the prospect? for
Western athletes in .general.
"Plaw Is the greatest hammer-thrower
in the world to-day," said Christie "I
watched his work while he was East and
it is certainly marvelous." California sent
a good lot of men East last time, but it
must be remembered that they competed
with championship men. That accounts
for their defeats. The trip also was hard
and left them in no fit condition for
work. ,
"California is better suited for the de
velopment of athletes than the East. The
climate is better here. . With the present
men and the advantages of this climate
we: should develop some record-breakers
I do not know yet exactly what course I
shall pursue in training. My methods
must : be In harmony with the condition
of the men 'and the circumstances under
which they are working. The conditions
here are new to me and I must look
about a bit. We commence light work
to-morrow. 'The track. Is too soft and in
too poor Â¦ a condition now for very good
work. It has not been repaired for the
season's training, but will soon be in
good shape."
â¢ Christie was accompanied here by his
wife. They have taken up their residence
at 2217 Fulton street. The new trainer is
a young man. not large, but of excellent
physique. , - . Â¦ -

sran against Hugh B. Jones. Frederick; R.
King and the Market Street Railway

a wagon driven by James Norman, an
employe of Jones & King. The horses
took fright and ran into Horgan. Injuring
him badly. He brought suit to recover

defendants and the railway company
took an appeal.

request," said Tobin. "I do not at this
time desire to give any expression of
opinion, but only ask that the ordinance
be referred to the proper committee."

rection?" ventured the. Mayor, and the
sally was received with loud laughter
by the members of the board.
"I would sufjgest that it go to the Com
mittee on Outside Lands," said Stafford.
"I think the Fire Committee is the prop
er one to consider the bill," put in Braun
hart; "it will certainly be 'hot stuff.*"
The bill was finally referred to the Po
lice Committee. By its provisions betting

very vigorous to-day and commanded the
cloaest attention. The plaintiffa urged thd
court to make a precedent for such extra
ordinary ca.-es. Counsel for the defense
replied bitterly to the pl^a for Inventing
a. precedent. The most remarkable ad
dress or argument was by Gustavus Wald,
who closed anl who. as a representative
German. Insisted that he did not reprer
sent any creed or class, but the Interests
of secular government. Most of the clergy
of the city were in the courtroom.
Wald turned to them when he said that
neither he nor any member of his family
belonged to a church and that none of his
kindred for generations have belonged
to any church, and that he was opposing
the prizefight for the interest of tha
State.

When Mrs. . Josephine Smith filed her
petition for another round or two ln the
divorce with her former husband, Charles
H. Smith, cashier of the Southern Pacific
Company, she laid special stress upon the
allegations that she was ill and, that her
confidence In opposing Counsel Foshay
Walker had been misplaced.* As Charles
II. Smith is not anxious to undergo again
the ordeal he suffered with" his wife as
cross-examiner he has filed affidavits op
posing that of his wife, bearing the signa
tures of his attorney, Mr. . Walker and
former Judge William R. Daingerfleld, be
fore whom Mrs. Smith made her debut as
Portia in proprla persona.
As to the allegations that Mrs. Smith
was ill. and unable to attend court on the
day her husband was granted a decree on
the ground of extreme cruelty, Judge
Daingerfield says:
I did not observe anythlnr ln the manner,
deportment or appearance of Mrs. Smith at
any of the times she was ln court tending to
show that she . was not well, or that she was
ill or in any way suffering 1 - physically. â¢ I am
certain If there had been any such indications
I ; would have observed them, for I save her
close attention at all times. ,;.-,','
This statement, made by Judge Dalnger
fleld under oath, takes much of the dram
atic interest from Mrs. Smith's averment
that, ill and hardly able to walk she
dragged' herself through the rain on the
night i preceding her husband's victory in
search of justice. - . ,
Foshay "Walker denies that he ever told
Mrs. Smith that he would secure a con
tinuance of the case until she , recovered
her health, as she alleges,- and resents
Mrs. Smith's imputation that he would
betray his client Into complications ln
the divorce proceeding. r
Continuing â¢ in his . affidavit Walker
throws a little more light on the broad
ness of â¢ Mrs. Smith's knowledge of. law.
He says that she seemed to hold him re
sponsible for her own erroneous conduct
d her defense, as well as for the alleged
sins on the part of her husbatid. He says
the deportment of Mrs. Smith during the
whole trial was, so far as he Is capable of
forming an opinion, defiant and exultant,
particularly during her cross-examination
of her former husband and during the
reading by : her oC a large number of let
ters containing the most abusive remark
concerning Mr.; Smith. In concluding, i;e
fcays that the defendant seemed to derive
much .satisfaction from the humiliating
position in which her former husband nec
essarily found hlmself^whlle being cross
examined by his then wife for a period of
two days by a series of questions Imput
ing almost every kind of dishonorable and
odious quality to him. Â¦ . > - .

By Affidavit Foshay Walker
and Judge Daingerfi eld
Refute Her Word.
One of the first acts of the company
was to purchase a ramshackle structure
at Melrose, , Alameda County. The pur
chase price * of the land and appurten
ances appears, It is said, on the books of
the company at $20,000, but It is declared
not to be worth $2000. - - :
The by-laws of the , corporation Â¦ fix no
time '- for the meetings of the directors,
and Partridge claims: that, the time of
holding the ; meetings was withheld from
him; by reason of the majority comprised
of the Pages and Bakers refusing to noti
fy him. - During, these meetings it is al
leged that i those associated with . Par
tridge procured the Issuance of the bal
ance of the stock/President Page secur
ing one block of 99,992 shares. -
-After making his will in favor of Mr.
and Mrs. Page, Partridge parted : with
about $6000, he alleges, and would have
parted with more money had it not been
for the intervention of W. R, Ramsdell,
a mining man," residing at the Palace
Hotel. Ramsdell heard the story of young
Partridge's will, communicated with his
father and Is now prepared to back him
in a legal fight which will probably re
sult in the arrest of both Page and his
wife and George W. Baker and his son,
on charges of ' conspiracy ' and attempted
kidnaping, possibly rivaling ln interest
the celebrated Campbell-Winthrop case,
for which the latter is doing a life sen
tence." ,..'Â¦'Â¦
Besides alleging the improper conver
sions oÂ£ stocks and the purchase at ficti
tious prfees of furniture and property, the
complaint s.ets forth that the Pages and
Bakers are about to sell the remaining
shares of stock and divert, misapply and
misappropriate the proceeds therefrom.
A restraining order is asked for the pur
pose of preventing these acts. It is also
asked that the Pages and Bakers be re
moved from the directorate of the com
pany.' . Â¦ Â¦
It was while Partridge was a resident of
the Page household at 80 Central avenue,
near Haight street, that he parted with
his money and made his will.
"How I came to do it I do not know."
he said last night. "A day or two after
it was made Page came to me and asked
me to throw Baker out as executor. How
he came to know that I had made such
a will I am at a loss to understand. Page
seemed mad about the matter and then
followed a series of petty persecutions.
On Saturday, night Page was looking for
me at the Grand Hotel. He flourished a
pistol and- threatened to kill melon sight.
"Jerry Hurd took the pistol away from
him and told me of the Incident. On Sun
day morning, while I was breakfasting at
the Palace Hotel with Mr. Ramsdell,
Page, who is . a large man,- came ln and
threatened to do me all. kinds of bodily
injuries. He went out quicker than he
came in. ' Since then my footsteps have
been constantly dogged."
As a further source of trouble. Partridge,
in an endeavor to recover the money from
which be parted, has levied an attach
ment on the residence and personal prop
erty of Frank W. Page and Deputy Sher
iffs last night guarded. the premises.
DENY STATEMENTS
OF MRS. SMITH
Aside from the formal allegations of
the complainant, there . is told by young
Partridge himself a peculiar tale of al
leged hypnotic Influence, under which he
declares he was Induced to part withall
his present and prospective holdings, the
former consisting of. his 'interest in the
company named ' and the latter of his
rightful share of the estate of his father,
Joseph Partridge,, a wealthy Â«nine owner
in Mexico, at present residing in Lon
don. The father's property^ is .valued at
several million dollars. 'Â¦ â¢ â¢ ~
Young Partridge came to this coast
about two years ago with a patented de
vice for smelting ores. He cast about for
capital and met Page and wife and the
Bakers, father and son. The company
v as Incorporated with a capital of $2,000,
000, about August 23,- 1900. Partridge,
Frank W. Page, George W. Baker, Harry
L. Baker and Lillian B. Page, wife of
Frank W. Page, being the directors first
selected. Each of the incorporators sub
scribed for three shares, the balance of
the stock being held by Partridge.
While the company was. -in process of
formation, Partridge became an Inmate
of the Page household. Along about the
first of June, 1900, Partridge claims that
he was induced to make a will in favor
of Page and his wife, in which she, . as
devisee, was to be entitled to two-thirds
of his estate, present and prospective,
and her husband the remainder. George
"VV. Baker, who drew up the will, was
named as executor, and then Partridge ;
began to part with his money. Mrs.
Page, according to Partridge's state
ments, apparently exercised a subtle in
fluence over him. '
Among the first acts of the new cor
poration was that of engaging offices, at
306 Pine street. I These were fitted up in
an elaborate manner at an expense, ac
cording to the bills, of $1700. while Part
ridge and his attorneys, Theodore J. Sav
age of this city and James W. Cochrane
of San Rafael, allege that less than half
that amount would have . covered the
original cost. â¢
Following this opening expense came
a large number of transactions which
form the basis of the filed complaint.
Partridge was to be entitled to 123,000
shares of the capital stock, but only 2003
were issued to him. He, while awaiting
the transfer of the stock, transferred and
assigned to the corporation all his rights
ln the patent smelter. *
With the election of Frank W. Page as
president. George W. Baker, vice presi
dent, and Harry L. Baker, secretary and
treasurer, the organization was complete.
Partridge and Mrs. Page formed the rest
of the directorate.

MME. SARAH BERXHARDT AS . THE ' DUC DE REICHSTADT, IN J ROS
TAN'D'S-GREAT PLAY "L'AIGLON! 1 (THE EAGLET), IN WHICH SHE
APPEARED LAST NIGHT AT THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE. :
Nevertheless, the Divine Sarah's Acting Is Great,}and With n.
Coquelin She Scores a Tremendous Hit in Rostand's Rlay.
IT is Impossible to deny that Madame
Bernhardt's performance of "L'Aig
lon" is a thing to be wondered atâ
yes, to be wondered at rather than
admired. It is a tour-de-force of ex
traordinary cleverness, but it is never
anything more; it is never convincing;
"L'Alglon" is always a woman mas
querading as a man.
But why go a-masquerading? Why be
anything but a womanâ 1 thing far more
lovely in the eyes of God and man than
ever a mere man can be? Because
MadamÂ© Bemhardt has exhaustedâ or
thinks she has-all the strong roles ever
written for women, and now wishes to
beat men at their own game. That is an
ignoble ambition that must ever fail of
its desire.
The same accomplishments that made
Madame Bemhardt so great in the roles
or her proper sex. appear, though not to
perfection, in "L-Aig-ton." There is the
beautiful voice, the clean-cut elocution.
the studied variation of speed, pltâ¬h and
tone, the grace and strength ot pesture,
the alert Intelligence guiding and control
ing all faculties and devicee. But the
well-known mannerisms are there alsoâ
thÂ© four-hundred-words-a-minute deliv
ery of rapid "passages, and the shooting
out the last word as if fired from a cata
pult.
CoQuelin a* Flambeau added strength to
the cast, of course, but hardly more than
was auided by M. Desjardins (as Metter
rdch)âa well-trained actor with absolute
mastery over his art. if ever there was
one. The rest of the cast had little to do,
and did it well.
The etagÂ« setting was beautiful and ap
propriate, except in thÂ© first act, where it
was mean ar.d shabby.
As to the play itself, it seems to me that
M. Rostand has done wonders with a sub
ject ill-chosen except for rabid Buona
partists. HÂ© has written passages of real
poetic beauty, such as Flambeau's dying
â¢speeches; a charming comedy scene (that
between the old Emperor and his grand
son, which opens the third act); a strik
ingly melodramatic scene (between Met
ternich and L'Aiglon, at the end of the
third act); a really original death scene
? the whole of act VT). For these let U6
*>* thankful; but how much more thank
ful should we have been could we havÂ©
been spared much of tho rest! The story
is practically told by the end of act III;
a-fter that there can be no further sus
pense as to the fata of the Duke. The
present sixth act should logically come im
mediately after the third. The fourth act
contains nothing of interest and much
that is puerile; the fifth act is dragged
In merely for a supernatural effect that
reads better than it sounds.
The fourth anil fifth acts were generous
ly cut last night, yet the play lasted four
hours. An evening dragged out to this
length ceases to be entertaining.
I must -not forget to add that after the
curtain fell ar.fi rr>se. dead heroes and
heroines would jump up with alacrity and
all smilingly answer curtain calls. If the
play at any time came near to producing
that illusion which is the essence of dra
matic art, this foolish practice broke that
Uusion completely. Is this your common
practice In Par's, Madame Bemhardt and
M. Coquelin? In stooping to this childish
ness do you honor vour art and do you
uphold the traditions of that Maison de
Aloliere to which you once belonged?

SOCIETY GREETS BEBNHABDT.
Gives Sarah, and Coquelin a Splendid.
Reception at Grand. Opera-House.
French, other than the Ollendorff varie
ty, was at a premium at the Grand
Opera-house last evening, and the great
French stars were greeted by a large and
fashionable audience whose most notable
deficiency was a French vocabulary. I
The regular first-nighters, the same
who made up the brilliancy of the opera
season, - turned out to welcome Bern
harfit end CoquelJn. They did not have
their opera clothes on, but they wore
their next best frocks and made the
house look bright and warm and elegant.
There was not a vacant seat either in
the orchestra or dress circle. The boxes
and loges also were all occupied and the
effect of the well-filled, well-dressed
house was decidedly brilliant.
The compatriots of the stars filed into
the family circle and gallery and from
those heights enjoyed the splendid acting
and the melodious verse of Rostand's
great play. They started the applause
that broke into the middle of the acts to
approve of the noble and patriotic lines.
They laughed at the delicious wit bo
d*efuy woven into the tragic lines; but
they were only a Emails circumstance of
the tremendous applause that caused the
curtain to be raised time and time again
after each act.
Between acts the gentlemen filed into
thÂ© lobby and discussed the wonderful
caressing voice of the divine Sarah, her
youthful appearance and her Intense act
ing. Marcus Mayer went round glorious
In full dress, with a string of Bohe

ADVANCEMENT Op UNIVERSITIES.
ONE of the most gratifying features of American
life is displayed in the promptness with which
nearly every demand for higher education U
complied with. As soon as it is known that a uni
versity of the first class is in need of funds the funds
arc forthcoming. %
The latest illustration; of' that fact is furnished by
the people of Baltimore in dealing with Johns
Hopkins University. That .institution has outgrown
its present quarters in the city. Room is needed for
expansion. Only a short time has elapsed- since that
need was first announced to the public, and already
steps Have been taken to' amply supply it. citi
zens of BaltiiH^re have come forward and, offered to
donate to the university 151 acres of; iand,tdescribed
by the Baltimore American as ''being admirably situ
ated on the outskirts of the city." Thejgift.is to be
made provided'that the sum of $i,ooo,ooÂ»' be raised to
increase the university endowment. That[stipulation is
put in the offer because in. the present condition of the
university, finances the gift of land would be a burden
rather than a benefit to the institution.
It is riot to, be doubted that the required million
will be speedily forthcoming.; Johns Hopkins
will then enter upon a new era' in its history. It will
no long"er be confined to comparatively narrow quar
ters within the city, but will have a spacious campus,
ample for all the needs of university life.

were there when ' they entered, many or

tried to quiet them. Father Johann gave

was he who was causing the disturbance.
After the service the two ladles went

Johann came to them. He listened while
the lady who apoke Russian explained
their errand. Then he put out both his
hands, and drawing Mme, M 'a head to
ward him kissed her gently on the fore
head.
"When two cr three are gathered to

turning toward a holy. picture that hung
in the, corner of the room. 'he began to
mutter long prayers In a voice that was
scarcely audible.
> When he had finished ho turned around
and walked vbrusquely -away. Mme. M
touched his arm and pointed to a purÂ«e
full, of gold which she had placed before
him. He turned back a moment, seized
the purse and walked off.
He had not gone many .yards when the
ladies saw a. poor man come up to him
begging. ' Without a moment's hesitation
Father Johann drew the purse oat of his
pocket and cave it to him. Money la

A lady In Switzerland who had a sick
son heard of Father Johann and decided
that she would so to Kronstadt and ask
him to pray for the boy. Friends in St.

priest, and asked, whether he thought It
would be of any use for Mme. M to
come so far;. .
"No,"- ho replied: "let her remain in
Switzerland. God can cure her son there.
I will pray for her, and she need not
come."
But the lady was not satisfied: she came
to Kronstadt, bringing another lady with
her as â¢ interpreter. They found rooms in

McKENZlE'S CONTEMPT.
7~*HE decision given yesterday by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, adjudging
Alexander McKenzie guilty of contempt of
ordering his imprisonment therefor in the County.
Jail for one year, is one of the most striking and re
markable ever rendered in this country. The record
of the doings of Arthur H. Noyes, United States Dis
trict Judge of Alaska, was denounced as "shocking."
The decision recites some of the principal acts of
Judge Noyes in connection with the litigation before
him from the time of his arrival at Nome with Mc-
Kenzie until the arrest of the latter for disobedience
to the process of the Court of Appeals. It dwells
upon the iniquity and corruption disclosed by these
proceedings as without a parallel in the history of
jurisprudence within the United States. The defense
of McKenzie that he acted under legal advice in dis
obeying the writ is pronounced to be simulated, not
withstanding one of his attorneys testified to the
effect .that he was so advised. Another defense, that
the property was beyond his control when the writ
reached him, was found to be equally unfounded,
although supported by oath, of the same attorney.
There can now be no question about the facts which
go to make up the career of this infamous judge.
If the President allows this man Noyes to remain
longer in office he will offer an insult to every honest
Judge upon the Federal bench and* to the whole bar
of the United States. It is understood that McKenzie
and Noyes have friends in high places, including Sen
ators and at least one member of the Cabinet, but if
corruption of this character and magnitude can escape
the prompt censure ar.d action of Congress and the
President, the late ceremonies in honor of the mem-,
ory of Giief Justice Marshall should pass for a hollow
mockery. The Call may congratulate itseif that it was
one of the first to sound the alarm on account of this
condition in Alaska, and that all its statements then
made, after most careful inquiry, have been fully
recorded in the most solemn form by this decision,
which will be read with the greatest interest through
out the United States. All we then said in commenda
tion of the Federal courts of this circuit has also been
realized, and the people will regard them with in
creased favor andesteem for this merited rebuke and
punishment of corrupt practices in judicial proceed
ings. The Legislature of the State and the commer
cial bodies of this city should unite in supporting the
courts and the due administration of the law by pub
licly denouncing this r.buse of justice in Alaska, which
not only cauccd great detriment to many of our citi
7ens, but disastrously affected the general r business of
the city.
EDWARD'S TITLE.
SHORTLY after the, death of Victoria it was
stated in the dispatches from London that
Edward desires to have more prominence given
to the title, of emperor than to that of king when the
time comes for his formal coronation. Not much at
tention was given to the report at the time, for it was
regarded as nothing more than rumor. It now ap
pears, however, that the subject is likely to become
one of some importance, and when Parliament as
sembles it may be requested by the Ministry to change
the title of the sovereign.. and crown Edward as
emperor.
Whether the agitation was started by the King
does not appear, but the discussion of the subject is
going briskly on. The London Law Journal has
openly advocated the change on the ground that the
present title is not sufficiently expressive of the im
perial character of the domain over which Edward is
to rule. It says the time has clearly come when the
title of "emperor." should no longer be confined to
India, but should be made to. include the whole of the
widely extended empire. It is further maintained that
in our time the designation "king" has come to be
more and more associated with monarchs of states of
lesser importance, like Greece, or. that are in a semi
dependent condition, iike Prussia. As Great Britain
is neither a weak nation nor a dependent nation, her
monarch should bear a title which, to the modern
world, signifies' the ruler of a domain of the first class.
The question is a sentimental one, and -yet sentimenr
counts in politics. Ever since the outbreak of the war
in South Africa there has been a growing spirit ot
imperialism in the great colonies of Canada and Aus
tralia. It would be gratifying to them to have the
head of their states known as Emperor of the^whole,
British empire, rather than as King of the compara
tively narrow islands of Great. Britain and Ireland.
That fact may have some influence in determining
Parliament to change the title, and consequently it is
not improbable the world may be called upon to hail
Edward not as king, but as emperor, on the day of
his coronation.
JUSTICE FOR THE BR0VE.
OUT of Secretary Long's recent letter to Senator
Morgan, explaining .why there * has been a
â¢ "failure to recognize' the services" of Lieuten
ant Hobson, Captain Clark and others of the fleet
that fought at Santiago, there has renewal of
the old controversy between the opposing supporters'
of Sampson and of Schley. ; The renewal is to be re
gretted for many reasons. In the first place the whole
subjecthas been threshed over many times,; all 'the
facts are known, and it is not likely the contestants
will ever agree as to the conclusion to be drawn from
them. We are thus having a controversy that injures
the repute of the navy, engenders antagonism between
two officers, both of whom the country, honors, and
all for no good end. The worst of it is that while that
quarrel goes on naval officers who are not in any way
responsible for it are kept out "of their deserved
promotion.
In the. course of his letter^ the Secretary says: "I
feel keenly the lack of- any recognition : of Hpbson,
whose* feat is famous . the" world over." . - Concerning*
the case of Captain Clark;of the. Oregon,. whose flying
trip around the Horn to take part in the battle is one:
of the marvelous feats of naval War, he says: ''Captain.
Clark is two numbers .worse off now than if there had
been no war/' .;" In/othcr words, 1 the men of the Manila
fleet have been promoted and rewarded while those
of the .West ! Indian* fleet , have ; received ' nothing? r
.The..S.ecrctary.says: /'It, is more than two years now:
Mayor Phclan's confession that. he entered. into a
political conspiracy with the Examiner to divert some
of the richest gifts in his official bestowal to "selfish
jrofit-makinR schemers not only proves that -he has.
stooped to that which is discreditable, but that on
occasions he will betray. his. pals.
A whisky trust has been established irdDenver,
where it is said more liquor is drunk than in any
other American city in the Union. 1 This is one of the
few cases where the consumers may be able to cheat
the monopoly by calling upon their internal reserve.
David B. Hill of New York says that he will not
under any circumstances accept the Democratic nomi
nation for the' Presidency. -If this means anything it
means that David has. been too long a mourner to
head the procession in another political wake.
It is to be hoped_ that the legislative investigation
into the affairs of the local Police Department will bÂ«
sufficiently thorough to prove to Mayor Phelan what
everybody else knows â that white men are the vic
tims of licensed Chinese coolies in this city. .
A' measure has been introduced in the State. Legis-
Iature"to abolish' grand juries. Perhaps it would
be unfair to suggest that those who are interested in
the bill consider it to be a measure of protection.
White men, it is said, are leading Indians to battle
in Mexico. ThU* ought to be one of the cases where

FATHER JOH ANN OF KRONSTADT
Many People of the Empire Looking
upon Him as a Saint -
In the present condition of things there it is per
fectly certain that unlawful liquor-selling will cease
during the spasm of excitement, only to be resumed
again under circumstances that teach disrespect for
all law.
In the tnidst of all this hurly-burly it is probable
that common sense enough may appear to resubmit
prohibition to the voters and get from them a de
cision calmly made, and one that will be backed by
public opinion.
Perhaps if Governor Stanley could borrow Mr.
Nation's horsewhip and use it on his rebellious son
the official air of Kansas would be clearer.
Kansas would not be Kansas if this were the only
rift in the lute. The Governor of the State is opposed
to Mrs. Nation's methods. But the Governor's son,
a college student, attacks his father and intimates that
the people made a mistake in electing him Governor.
Surely this is an interesting reform movement. The
liatchet-swinger for prohibition married to a con
genial spirit who does not need to get drunk to use a
whip in enforcing matrimonial 'discipline!
So Kansas has a divided Nation. It appears that
the Nations have disagreed before. The smasher and
her husband came from that seat of universal calm,
Texas, and it is said tobe of record that when Mrs.
Nation chafed under the conjugal yoke Mr. Nation
had the habit of bringing 'her around with a horse
whip. Their neighbors are now of the opinion that
if Carrie carry her hatchet too far afield," on her re
turn to home base she will need it to defend herself
from a licking at the hands of her reformatory
husband.
Then Mr. Nation arose and roared in his wrath. It
was his first roar since these proceedings began. It
was in disapproval of Mrs. Nation's tour . abroad
while unsmashed saloons remained at home. He said
he had invested his hard-earned money in the smash
reform and had stood by his wife while she was
making the domestic rum-Â§eller seek the cyclone cel
lar, but he declined to; equip her as an invading force
to carry war into the States with which Kansas is at
peace.. â¢ â¢
But, like some of the storms that sweep across
those great prairie plains between the Missouri and
the Mississippi, Mrs. Nation's' tempest seems to have
spent itself at Des Moines, for she received notice
that her Chicago lecture was canceled, as only $12
worth of tickets had been sold.
All Western Iowa turned out ;to hail the great
Carrie, the war angel of Kansas, the bearer of glad
tidings and a hatchet. The old lady made speeches,
prayed-and extended the glad hand at every station,
and when ; she reached DesMoines business was
blocked by the. crowd and the police had to hew a
path with their clubs before the captain of the Smash
Ladies could go to, her carriage.
THE KflNSflS W0Y.
XA RS. NATION snfashed enough plate glass
/ \ and hacked enough cherry bars to get a stock
of that .notoriety* which is a step-brother to
fame, and then she accepted lecture engagements and
left Kansas to the demon rum while she went forth
to win pin money on the platform. En route to
Chicago she passed across Iowa like a conqucress.
That State has "had her kind of hysterics and has
cherished a desire, to make people sober and religious
by statute. For years the prohibition movement there
suffered from the name of its leader, Mr. Todhunter,
whose peculiar and thirst-suggesting cognomen was
wrought into ribald verse by the scoffers. '^k'k
It is reported that an attache of the American lega
tion is in possession of over $;oo,ooo in money and
valuables stolen from the house of Lu Sen, the â¢ un
fortunate Chinese nobleman who was executed by
order of the Empress Dowager because he was op
posed to the Boxer uprising against foreigners. His
family has been outraged and oppressed, and finally
robb*ed of all they had, by the very people in whose
behalf he lost his life. The missionaries will hardly
expect that family to build. many Christian churches.
White civilian looters now go almost alone through
out North China and demand money and take prop
erty from the terrified people. One of these enter
prising persons started in with no capital but a mule
cart and has robbed until he is rich. He had only tcÂ»
enter a village and announce that he was a "high, top
side English war man" and rob the town as easily as
Black Bart used to stand up a mountain stage. This
civilian stealing, however, is petty larceny compared
to the looting done by the military, under the eye of
the officers who represent the various Christian na
tions that are'lTiere to protect religion and its mis
sionaries.
woman's piercing scream broke from the muffling
depths of a cluster of houses and spent its echoes in
the empty streets." Â¦ '
All who resisted robbery were killed, and even the
Sikhs and Sepoys sickened of the mere butchery of
unarmed men while they were begging for mercy.
When another large city was entered without resist
ance by order of Earl Li the troops were fed. There was
no Chinese military force near. The inhabitants were
non-combatants and unarmed, incapable, of resistance.
The day the allied forces took possession the streets
teemed with people and the daily life aiyd business
flowed normally. The next day "shops' were closed
and the streets were deserted, except by German,
French and Italian soldiers wheeling hearts loaded
with stolen property. The city was- systematically
looted. The narrator says: ."Now and then a
The latter has been marked by the German punitive
expeditions, in which the French and British have
taken part, which have^been nothing but expeditions
for murder and brigandage. Cities have been entered
without resistance, and whose people, by orders of;Li
Huqg Chang, had received the foreign troops hos
pitably, feeding them :,nd furnishing all needed sup
plies, and such cities have been systematically looted
and every Chinese murdered who dared to resist the
breaking of his doors and theft of his property.
One of these forays visited the city of Tuliu, which'
was entered without firing a shot and found to be
already in possession of a British non-commissioned
officer and two privates. The troops looted and
burned the town.
But Von Waldersee was commander-in-chief of the
allied forces, and must do something to justify his
journey and his high ppsition. An American, Mr.
Millard, has described the situation as consisting of
three distinct phasesâ resistance, punishment and're
vengeâthe first natural, the second necessary, the
third criminal." : "I

PACIFYING CHINA.
A Third Sex.
In 1540 Harriet Martlneau found only
seven gainful occupations open to women,
and of these but four took them away
from home. In 1830 nearly 4.000,000 Ameri
can women were engaged In 380 out of 369
occupation*. At. present there are prob
ably 5,000,000 American women engaged in
about 400 gainful pursuits. European
women are still more "advanced." In ISiW
only 12 per cent of American women Were
engaged in what might be called exclu
sively bread-winning occupations, while
In Germany the percentage was 23, and
in England 27. In France 40 per cent of
the factory "hands" were women, and
outside of the factories were thousands
more of female workers.
Henry P. Flnck thinks this Invasion by
women of the bread-winning occupations
must inevitably change the character of
women unless it . soon be checked. As
they obtain the same education, engage
In the same pursuits, follow the sama
ideals, their thoughts and feelings, he be
lieves, their tastes and manners, and even
their features, must gradually approxi
mate those of men. The final result then
would be the creation of a sex antagonism
which can have but one of two effects.â

Loot in Mrs. Nation's Wake.
The Anthony Republican is at hani
with a full account of the Joint-smashing
crusade led by Mrs. Sheriff. A. terrlblo
feature of the 'work, says this paper, was
the opportunity offered and eagerly selzei
for looting. Men and boys followed tho
women from saloon to saloon and helped
themselves to many gallons of liquor and
many thousands of cis'ars. The result was
that the town became filled with drunken
men and boys. Boys could be seen spew
ing about the streets irom the unaccus
tomed use of tobacco, and a number of
them were drunk who probably had never
tasted liquor before In their lives. We
gather from the Republican's account that
the occa.Â«ion became a big town drur.k.
and it is a sad and curious commentatry
on this kind of temperance education. â

AXTSTil A1.I A SAILS FOR' TAHITI
Goes 'Out Loaded With Freight, but
With Small List of Passengers.
The Oceanic Mail Company's steamship
Australia got away for Papeete, the capl T '
tal of Tahiti, yesterday. She was a lit
tle behind time owing to some freight
coming down at the .last minute, but as
she is in first class trim Captain Lawless
thinks he can make up the delay in port
and make the islands on schedule time.
The Australia did not take away many
passengers, .but there were a number of
tourists among them, and when this new
paradise of the Pacific comes to be known
the rush there will be greater than to
Hawaii. :' Â¦* ' ' -.- Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
The Ventura Delayed.
The Oceanic Steamship, Company's mail
Jjoat Ventura will not get away for Ha
waii, Samoa, New Zealand and Australia
until Thursday. February 14, at 9. p. m.
The Knglish mails are delayed and will
not get here until about 7 p. m. on the
14th, 1 and as soon as they are aboard the
mail boat will sail. â¢ ' *
The accident on board the steamship
Ventura on January 23, in which five men
were killed and five Injured by the burst
ing of a steam pipe, was investigated yes
terday afternoon by Captains Holies and
Bulger, local United States inspectors of
Bteam vessels. The principal witnesses
were S. N. Haines, chief engineer; T. W.
Lawrence, first assistant; J. V. Ainsworth,
second assistant; and M..; McGinn, repre
senting the -builders. The 'chief engineer
and his assistants told about the break
ing of the steam pipe, which they ascribed
to imperfect. construction on the- part of
the builders. There was 165 pounds of
steam pressure at the time of the frac
ture. There was absolutely no unskillful
ness In the handling of the engine, they
said. Mr. McGinn said that he did not
believe in the theory of faulty construc
tion, but when he was pinned down to
details admitted that lie did not know
any thing about the cause of the accident.
The inspectors will render a decision
next week.
The Overdue Fleet.
The Bertha Is now out 111 days from

c*nt to reinsure their chances, : but the
gamblers will not touch one of the fleet.
On the Ardnamurchan, seventy-one days
out from Frazer River for Liverpool 70
per cent is being paid, and on the" Ilala,
ninety-two days out from Montevideo for
British Columbia. 45 per cent. . The
schooner Vine, which was almost given
up as lost, has arrived at Mollendo, Peru,
after a very long run of 125 days from
Port Bragg. - ~ -* - â¢ .
"Captain Jansen of. the schooner William
Renton was out in the -gale that Is sup
posed to have made trouble for the over
due fleet. He says that off Flattery, there
was never two hours at a time the wind
could be depended upon. Off the Colum
bia River it was still' worse, and while
on one tack with a - strong southeaster
blowing, in five minutes | it would have
changed to northwest; and the schooner
would be thrown on her beam ends.
Then It would blow a gale - from the
southwest and so worlfc. its â¢ way around

SAN JOSE. Feb. 1L-No trace has yet been
found of Ralph Beckwith, the feeble-minded
boy who m-andered away from his home near

dred persons with Sheriff Landlord and others
are out to-day looking for him.
Samuel Ostroskl's $150,000 estate, lo
cated in this city and in Chlco, must
wend Its way through a contest In the
Probate Court before the Jieirs may enjoy
their allotted portions. Ostroski died July
31, 1S97. A will, iÂ£* which he bequeathed
the bulk of his property to his -Â»wldow,
Amelia Ostroski .' was filed . and In Feb
ruary last was admitted to probate.
Yesterday afternoon Louis J. Ostroski,
Ricka Breslauer. Yettel Sllberstein. Rosa
Cohen and Sarah Wise, nephew and
nieces of the deceased, through their at
torney. Samuel M. Shortrldge. filed a con
test asking that the order admitting the
will to probate be vacated and set aside.
The contestants allege that the deceased
was of unsound mind at the time of the
execution of the will, was unduly influ
enced and that the testament was improp
erly executed. It Is claimed that in 1592 the
deceased suffered a stroke of apoplexy,
which ultimately resulted In his death,
and while still conscious his widow and
other beneficiaries unduly Influenced him
to disinherit the contestants. It Is al?o
averred that the nephew and nieces weru
denied admittance ' to their uncle's sick
room and his mind was poisoned against
them.
Unduly Influenced by His
Widow.

Kilmer & Co., Blnghamton. N. Y., for a free
sample bottle of Swamp-Root, the celebrated
specific which is having such a {Treat demand

the sample bottle of Swamp-Root will also be

Â¦To-day we see a relative, a friend or an ac
quaintance apparently well, and in a few days
we may be grieved to learn of their serious
illness or sudden death, caused by that fatal
type of kidney troubleâ Bright 1 s disease.
While scientists are puzzling their- brains to
find cut the cause, each individual can. by a
little precaution, avoid the chances of con
tracting: dreaded and dangerous kidney trouble
or eradicate it completely from their system
if already afflicted. Many precious lives might
hare been, and many more can yet be saved,
by paying attention to the kidneys.
Kidney trouble often becomes advanced Into
acute stages before the afflicted is aware of
its presence: that Is why we read of so many
Eudden deaths of prominent business ana pro
fessional men. physicians and others. They
have neglected to stop the leak in time.
At no time in the history of disease has
there been such an alarming increase In. tho

Southern Pacific in competing for tho
immigration travel to California. "Only
$30 for a ticket from Chicago to San Fran

many books that are being distributed in
all the Eastern States. A prominent offi
cial of the road stated yesterday that
they expected to handle an enormous
amount of the so-called immigration traf

It is the Intention of the Santa Fe Rail
road to strengthen its position and to
handle a larger proportion of the trans

AngelO, the present western terminus of
the Lampasas branch of that railroad.
The objective point of the survey Is Pecoa
City, about 13a miles west of San Angelo.
It is the purpose of the company to ex
tend the Lampasas branch to Pecos City.
where connection trill be made with the-
Pecos and North and Northeastern Rail

the hell holes in my own State are wiped

FINDLAY. Ohio. Feb. U.-The methods
of Mrs. Carrie Nation were adopted here
Â¦last night by three women and one man
Â¦with success. A large number of penny
in-the-slot machines had been distributed
In the city by a confectionery firm. The
machines were hung on telephone poles hi
front of every schoolhouse in the city and
aroused the bitterest condemnation of the
parents of school children. At a late hour
last night three women, accompanied by
a man, armed with hatchets utterly de
molished the machines In front of every
schoolhouse in the city. Public sentiment
appears to be with them, and some of the
more ardent Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union women of the city are now"
crying to have the saloons, which are run
notoriously open here, treated In the same
manner. . . â¢ .
TOPEKA, Ka'n., Feb. ll.-As a result of
the meeting of pltizens ofTopeka yester
day afternoon all, the; joints,. of the city
are closed to-day. ; The citizens made th?
peremptory order that , the . saloons be
closed by noon to-day, and .as .far as 15
known the order was regarded. Early this
morning Chief of Police Stahl. with some
of his officers; made the rounds of the
joints and notified the keepers as I far as
they could be found that they, would De
expected to close. They were in'each case
presented with a printed copy of Â¦ the citi
zens' ultimatum and commanded in -the in
terest of law and order to close-at:once.
Chief Stahl told the jolntists; that; there
waa an army of a thousand men, Waitinar
to march on a notice, Â« to- close
the joints of the city,, and that they ; were
of a. class that would not be freightened
out -of -performing their, duty, as they in
terpreted -it. -. Notices were slipped undÂ»r
the doors of the closed places. -
In only one. place did the officers find
any liquor sold, and this place agreed to
close at'once. " ' . , :Â¦ Â¦
To-night Topeka is practically a dry
town.so far as the lolnts are concerned.'
Some of the drugstores are said to be do
ing a thriving business,; but the condition
is much different from a; week. or even a
day ago. when there were about eight v
joints running openly, all of -which Were
equipped with the finest of fixtures. Tile
citizens' commute has made all the neces
sary arrangements for the enforcement
of its orders regarding the Joints, and will
Insist that the order be carried out to the
letter, and that every drinking place t*y
closed and the stock and fixtures removed
from the cityiby next i*riday noon.
The condition of public sentiment in
Topeka to-night is something remarkable.
There has never been anything here ap
proaching It. The vigilance committee is
ready to move on very short notice.
HOLTON, Kan., Feb. ll.-The crusade
against the jointists which was com
menced here Sunday was vigorously
continued to-day. At a mass-meeting
held in the Methodist church a commit
tee was appointed to Investigate the report
that the place owned by Mrs. Hlcks.which
was raided Saturday, was open again.
The committee discovered that the' report
was true, and as a result the temperance
workers again raided the place and com
pelled Mrs. Hicks and her son to slyn a
contract, drawn in a legal form, to the.
efitect that they would never again sell
liquor during their natural lives, arid
the eon agreed to leave Holton and remain
away for a period of ten years. Later in
the day another mass-meeting was held
to consider a proposition to destroy all the
liquor that had been seized by the Sheriff
and stored at the courthouse. A motlpn
that this be done was defeated, but after
the meeting adjourned most of those In
attendance went to tfte â¢ courthouse and
demanded the llauor. The deputy in
charge made a tame effort to protect the
property, but to no avail. The raiders
turned the llauor Into the gutter, and,
taking the bar fixtures outside, burned
them in the street, making the work of
destruction complete.
To-night the Sheriff, accompanied by a
posse, raided a Joint owned by Mrs. Haist.

dently turned out through curiosity," for

NEW YORK. Feb. 11.â Mrs. Josephine
Bell Clopton. whose troubles with her
husband, William C. Clopton, a wealthy
lawyer, have been before the divorce
courts of Dakota and this city, Is now be
ing fcued In the Supreme Court to recover
$500,000 damages for alleged slander. The
case came before Judge Fitzgerald to-day
on a motion made in behalf of Mrs. Clop
ton to file a bill of particulars or to make
her complaint more definite. . â
Mrs. Riker, who Is a* couein of Secre
tary of the Navy Long, figured in Mrs:
Clopton's divorce cult, her name j being
broug-ht into the case. She charges ; that
the statements in Mrs. Clopton'B com
plaint in her suit -for divorce were mali
cious slanders so far as she, Mrs. Rlksr,
is concerned, and she also alleges that on
November 2S last her character was at
tacked by Mrs. Clopton in the presence
of several persons. She claims $260,000
damages for each cause of action for
charges made in Mrs. Clopton's complaint
and for the statements made last No
vember. Mrs. Clopton desires to know
whether one of Mrs. Rlker's causes of
action Is based solely on the charges
made in her Complaint, because if so it is
privileged and cannot be the basis of a
course of acticn.
Mr. Clopton sued his wife for divorce
In Dakota and finally obtained a decree.
Her divorce suit here is still pending.
Judge Fitzgerald reserved his decision.

NF.W TORK Feb. 11.â There was a very
notable decline In the volume of dealings on
the Stock Exchange to-day and the most active
Ftocks were those under pressure, with the ex
ception of Union Pacific, which was bought
with persistency on a rising scale. The market
Â¦was again characterized by the wide movement
In a very large number of unimportant stocks,
which are seldom prominent* In the dealings
and which sometimes do not appear in the rec
ord of transactions for weeks at a time. In
this class some of thpbe recently brought for
ward Into prominence continued active at fur
ther advances, while others met profit taking
and turned back.
Chicago and Eastern Illinois was conspicuous
for a violent ripe of 6~>i. the preferred stock
rising 4 and rallying Evansville and Terre
Haute 2U after a decline of a point. Stocks
it. this class : were only prominent, however,
relatively Fpeaking, by contrast with their us
ual obscurity. The movement In the general
3 1st was extremely confused all day and
the greater part of the day's business In stand
ard railroad stocks was done below Saturday's
level.
London pent lower prices for the interna
tionals to start with and there was some \-ery
heavy selling of Atchison and at one time also
of Union Pacific. A strong rally In the latter
rtork and an advance in Atchison to 67 brought
the market generally to the best of the day.
Union Pacific was lifted 2 points over Sat
urday and the preferred 1*Â». Pennsylvania
was the only other active trading stock among
the standard railroads that rose as much as
a point over Saturday and In fact no railroad
*tÂ«.ck of importance fell as much as -a point
btlow Saturday at any time, thus Indicating
the general sluggishness of the market. The
specialties <Ild better. Sugar rising at one time
2 points and People's Gas 2%, the latter on
the (toed financial whowing made in the annual
r-port. Pacific Mall rose Z\i and International
Paper 2V Western Union was advanced 1%.
The eteel stocks shared In the sluggishness of
the general market and only the preferred
etocks of any companies sold as much as a
point above Saturday. They were, as a rule
however, firmly held. Speculation, having ac
cepted the reported merger as a fake, now
awaits . an authoritative announcement of
the financial terms of the deal for a. further

CHICAGO. Feb. ll.-Saturdaj-'s strenuous
and confident bears, relying on calculations of
bearish statistics with which to begin a new
profitable week, were to-day driven to cover.
The statistical reports forecasted Saturday
proved accurate, but instead of finding any
yielding market on which to secure profits,
shorts were confronted by a very stiff market,
with the opening price of the May option un
changed at 74HÂ©74\c. The market had been
fold to a standstill and the rush to cover ap
proached a utampede. which, despite more lib
eral offerings from longs on the rise, carried
May to 75% during the first hour. The chief
factor in overcoming the bcarishness of thÂ«>/
statistics was thq strength early develODed lit
the corn market, although a reported reduction
in the estimate of Argentina's exportable sur
plus, steadiness in the Liverpool market and
the moderation of Northwest receipts, were
contributory aids.
Heavy clearances and a decrease In the vis
ible were influential additions to the day's
bullish considerations, which resulted In a fur
ther advance during the afternoon' to 7">5ic.
This bulge near the end of the session Invited
realizing by loncs, under which a reaction to
"oUc took place, but the close was strong, May
%c hlshcr at 'W^i'b%e. A feature of the day's
trading was the relative weakness of July
wheat, which was persistently dumped on the
market in liberal quantities. .
Corn was active and strong from start I to
finish. Speculative Interest was keen, the vol
ume of business heavy and prices above pre
vious high records for the crop. Small receipts,
unfavorable weather and excellent cash de
mand* formed the basts of the market's
strength. May closed %<3"ftc improved from
Saturday.
There was little business transacted In -'the
oats market. May closed %c higher at 25?<iC.
Provisions were moderately active, while
prices were sustained by the reflected strength
of the grain and hog markets. The cash de
mand was good, but the pit trade was without
special feature. May Â¦ pork closed 10c higher,
lard unchanged and ribs Sc up.
The leading futures ranged as follows:/' -/.

VICTORIA, B. C. Feb. 1Lâ The British

anxiety to the underwriters, who have
within the past few days sent a number
of long cable inquiries to her consignees
here. Is safe. She came ln off Cape Beale
at noon to-day and signaled, asking to be
reported. A tug has been sent for her.
The Ilala Is nlnetv-seven days from

Sixteen days ago an Indian sealer picked
up one of her life-buoys while hunting
seals near Uclulet. This buoy was brought
down by the revenue cutter Grant, and,
as nothing had been heard of the ship, it
was feared she had been lost. The wind,
until Saturday and Sunday, had been
blowing heavily off the coast, which fact
no doubt accounted for her non-arrival
until now. Twenty per cent reinsurance
was offered on her.

ASTORIA, Or., Feb. ll.t-W. Anderson
of Vancouver. B. C, owner of the salmon
cargo of the British ship Ardnamurchan,
has given up -all hope for the vessel. . For
some weeks past salmon has come ashore
along the coast near this city, and
Anderson came over from Vancouver to
investigate. : Inquiry proved conclusively
that the ealmon came from the Ardna
murchan, and he expresses the belief that
tho vessel and her crew of twenty-three
men have gone to the bottom.
The Ardnamurchan sailed from the
Fraser River on November 23 and was off
the Columbia River when the first of the
three great gales arose. Doubtless she
was capsized and carried her helpless
crew to the bottom. The sanw gale
caused the loss of the Andrada, hope for
which has been entirely abandoned.
It now appears that another lumber
schooner has been wrecked on this coast.

GRASS VALLEY, Feb. H.-Detalls have
Just come to light of a robbery that for
boldness and daring exceeds anything re
corded here in years. A week ago a rich
strike was made in the Empire mine j A
portion of the ledge about six feet long
and four inches wire was seamed with
gold. Before having it removed, the man
agement decided to let It stand until some
of the owners of the mine could arriye
and see the bonanza in its native state
On Sundays no one works In the m'lne
but the pump man. The door barricading
the mouth of a drain tunnel was broken
open by robbers, who traveled 2000 feet to
the shaft. They then descended about
1500 feet and went into a drift 800 feet long
where the rich ledge was uncovered. They
drilled two holes, using forty of the com
pany's drills to do the work and display
ing a thorough knowledge of the mine and
the location of its tools. Then they de
liberately fired the blasts.
The pump man heard the reports, but
thought some of the men beins paid by
the company were at work. The thieves
must have taken at least 300 pounds cf
ore, and it is safe to say they took onlv
the richest, for what they left where they
had been working contained considerable
gold.
It is estimated that the value of tho
stolen ore was not less than $10,000. De
tectives are at work on the case.

TO ENCOURAGE USE
OF VOTING MACHINES
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. ll.-Senator Smith of Kern
has introduced a constitutional amend
ment designed to make optional with the
counties the use of voting machines. His
amendment Is as follows:
Sec. G. The inhibitions of the constitution
notwithstanding, the Legislature shall have
power to provide that in different parts of the
StatÂ« different methods may be employed for
receiving and registering the will of the people
as expressed at elections and may provide that
mechanical devices may be used within deslfr
tiate-1 FulxllvlBlons of the State at the â¢option
of the local authority indicated by the Legrlsla
;ure for that purpose.
The amendment is not necessary to al
low the adoption of a voting machine,
provided that the machines are put in use
all .over the State. Smith Introduced an
amendment to the constitution during the
eession of 1Kb and at the succeeding gen
eral election it was adopted. It was
found, however, that it would be almost
Impossible to adopt the machines all over
the fotate at the Fame time, and bo the
amendment has not been taken advantage
of. The constitution provides that elec
tion laws shall bo general and uniform,
and fo until Smith a new amendment has
been adopted no voting machine can be
nut in use anywhere in the State unlosl
& b Â«iP U K ln SÂ£P rwht **'. a condition which
Smith hopes his amendment will relieve
so far as voting machines are concerned".

QUAKER DOCTORS
SUDDENLY DECAMP
They Make a Clean- Up and
Disappear Prom Their
Offices.
"Leo and Francis. Quaker X>octors:
Office Closed on the Lord's Day," is thÂ«
lettering of a sign on a door leading tc
a suite of rooms In tho building at 933
Market street. That particular office Is
not only closed on "the Lord's day." but
on every other day, so far as tha
"Quaker Doctors" are concerned. J. F.
Hall, who was formerly engaged in the
undertaking business at Fresno, bought
"Dr. Leo'*" Interest In the business for
11000 on the 5th ult, and Is now left to
face tho fury of the victims of the fakers.
"Dr. Leo," whosa real name 13 Fred a
Walton, left for his old home in Boston,
Mass., a week after disposing of his In
terestln the business to Hall. Franz C.
A. Ooersa, who posed as "Dr. Francis."
remained here until a week ajro last
Thursday, and then suddenly departed
for Boston to Join Walton, leaving many
saloon-keepers to bewail the loss of liquid
refreshments furnished him on credit.
The missing "Quaker Doctors" arrived
here In the latter part of October last,
after having made a clean-up in Lead*
vllle. Colo. They opened at Central Parb
and made money. Then they visited dif
ferent sections of the city and gave open
air entertainments to attract crowds.
With the entertainment they gave their
"delighted audiences" an opportunity to
buy remedies warranted to cure any
thing but a broken leg. Offices. were next
opened at 935 Market street and patients
flocked to the "Quakers." For tha sum
of $100. half paid down as a "guarantee
cf good faith," they agreed to cure "In
curable diseases." They numbered their
victims by the hundred. Some of tha
victims received as much as a bottle ot
water with a squirt of peppermint in it.
to be used in the cure of cancer. Others
got water with a little coloring matter,
to cure them of rheumatism. Tha
"Quaker Doctors" had a good time and
a rich harvest.
When Hall bought out Walton's inter
est, "Dr. Francis" agreed to remain hera
and carry out all contracts entered into
by the firm. A week ago.' Monday last,
he failed to appear at the office. Hall
went to his room in a downtown hotel.
"Dr. Francis" excused himself by say-
Ing that he had "gone off on a drunk"
and didn't want to show up until he waa
sober. When Thursday came and the
doctor failed to appear Hall became anx
ious and went to the hotel. He then
learned that "Dr. Francis" had left on
the morning train for Boston.
Hall and the other victims have no re
dress in criminal law. as the transactions
of all of them with th.e fugitives were in
contract form and could only be tried In
civil suits.
On motion of Rowe it was also resolved
to rescind the appointments of all copy

ITS NEXT CURE
William H. A. Waldeck, who was for a
short time captain of a company in the
Seventh Volunteer Regiment of lmmunes.
raised In Kentucky during the war with
Spain, was arrested yesterday by De
tective Harry Reynolds at 405 Geary street
and was locked up in "the tanks" at the
City Prison pending developments. He
arrived here from the East about January
9 and registered at the Palace Hotel.
There he ran up a bill amounting to |19 15.
and as he was unable to liquidate It he
was notified to quit on January 16, and
his trunk was detained as security for tha
bill.
Waldeck has been wearing the uniform
of a captain of the army and representing
himself to clergymen and business men, it
is alleged, as still in the service. Com
plaints were made to Captain Seymour by
the officers at the Presidio that WaldecK
was so representing himself and asking
them for money. A firm of military out
fitters on Butter street complained that
Waldeck had got from them a captain a
cap valued at $11 and had left his old one
to be repaired. He had also ordered a set
of epaulette^, which had not been called
for. He represented to them that he was
an army officer. The Rev. Dr. Parrtsh of
the Church of the Advent, who says ha
is so poor that he has to live In the base
ment of his church, complained that Wal
deck had got $3 from him on tho repre
sentation that he was expecting money
from the East. He had called upon other
clergymen, among them the Rev. Dr.
Clampett. who gave him a letter of intro
duction to the Rev. Mr. Hitchcock of San
Rafael. It was those complaints that led
Captain Seymour to detail Detective Rey
nolds to arrest Waldeck.
Waldeck was living at 405 Geary street
under the name of G. Wilson, and it is al
leged that he got goods from merchants
under that name. Among them was the
Welsbach Company. 140 Ellis street.
Among the papers found in Waldeck s
possession was one from Colonel G. L.
Glllesple of the United States Corps of
Engineers. New Jork. dated May 24, 1898.
to the adjutant general of the army at
Washington recommending Waldeck for a
commission in the army and stating that
he had been an officer In the artillery of
the army of the Netherlands, as his father
had been before him. He had also bundles
of letters of recommendation from clergy-
Two letters written by himself, onÂ© to
J. C. Astredo, superintendent of the
Church Mission Home. 606 Folsom street,
and the other not addressed, showed that
Waldeck had contemplated suicide. In the
letter to Astredo he said that he intended
to end his own life, and asked him to get
his trunk from the Palace Hotel and send
the consents to his" wife.

AN Introduction to you from H. Schellhaaa tha
I furniture dealer. 11th and Fr__ataÂ» Oakland.DEL MONTE, Feb. 11.â Five black
swans were hatched -on the lake In the
Del Monte grounds a few days ago, and
the notable, arrivals are so far thriving
better than any of their kind hitherto
hatched in America. A curious incident
occurred in connection with the arrival of
this brood. When the eggs were laid the
rapid rising of the lake caused by the re
cent rains imperiled their safety, and the
parent swans began building the nests
higher and higher as the water rose. By
diligent work they were able to keep the
eggs above water, and the brood finally
came out without a wetting.
Five Black Swans Hatched.
The , murderer came to Redlands and

Schiffler Is a young man, about 30 years
of age. He has eighteen months In which
to complete his trip by way of the Philip
pines and home to Coeslin. Germany.
The traveler was captured by the Flat
head Indians in Montana and remained
three days in the lodge of the chief. He
reached the- Indian reservation cold and
hungry and requested food and shelter.
When the warriors were Informed that
he harl no money they passed. him by
with a sneer. He applied to the big
chief, who took him in and dressed him as
a brave and ordered him to participate in
a native dance then in progress. The
daughter of the chief was given to him
for a partner, and the young German,
dressed in the chiefs robes, was made a
butt of aboriginal ridicule.
A gayly attired young brave, who was
seeking the hand of the chief* daughter,
objected to her being given to the Ger
man. He offered some remonstrance and
was encouraged by others. Soon his an
ger became uncontrollable.
He drew a scalping knife from his belt
ana dashed furiously at the Intruder. The
old chief stepped to the front and quelled
the disturbance, preventing the death of
the traveler.
After the dance was' over the Indians
gave Schiffler to understand that the
whole proceeding -was a joke. They per
mitted him to take several snapshot pic
tures of the camp and warriors and let
, ?Â° 1 , on hl3 Journey without further
molestation.

Entrapped in a Vancouver Store, but
Succeeds in Making His
Escape.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 11.â Robert
Walker, . manager of the Royal Bank of
Canada; Police Officer John McLean, and
a . cousin named Jenkins, had a -burglar
safely locked in a store early this morn
ing, yet the robber held up the trio and
escaped. . . . .
For threo months Vancouver's residence
sections have been terrorized by a burglar
who has robbed- from one to five houses
nightly. I He Is never seen and not a cent's
worth of goods he has stolen has ever
been found. â¢ Early this morning Officer
McLean noticed that the rear window of
Pike's Shoe Warehouse, one of the larg
est in the city, was open. He saw the
burglar Inside and hastened for help.
Bank Manager Walker, and Jenkins came
back with him and rattled the front door
of the establishment while McLean wait
ed at the rear window, out of which, the
burglar would naturally" emerge. - Â«
But the burglar did not fall in with this
programme. When the front door was
rattled he quickly unlocked it and stepped
out on the main street. Covering the two
men with a revolver, he ordered them to
hold up their hands, and, in sight of the
policeman and all he ran down the street
and escaped. Â¦ . -

SAN JOSE,^-Feb. 11.â The Government

who looked forward to a first-class water
way will report the defects to California'3
representatives in Congress. The proposed
cutoff at Devil's Elbow Is the part of the
work complained of. While the intention
of the Government engineers was good,
in that it shortened the distance nearly a
mile, the cutoff is so narrow that two ves
sels will not be able to pass in it. It Is
proposed to make the bottom of this chan

Attorney Herrington, counsel for Bege
row. asked that the charges of murder
against Begerow be dismissed at the open
ing of court this morning, on the ground
that the evidence was not sufficient to ob
tain a. conviction, but the court refused
it. Â¦..-...'. - / .
:The first three trials were for the mur
der of Joseph Cech, but this one is for
the killing of August Berger. In the first
trial B. Benjamin, a juror, ran away to
Australia just the case went to
the Jury and this necessitated a new trial.
The second resulted in a= disagreement,
the Jury standing 6 to 6, and the third
went tha same way, the Jury standing jj
to 4 for acquittal.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 11.â For the fourth time
Frederick Begerow, an ex-Constable of
Alviso, faces a charge of murder in Judgo
Lorigan's department of; the Superior

had placed George Schmidt, an old man
known as "Bismarck," ' under arrest and
started to take him from the park. Cech
and Berger' interfered and. tried to take
the prisoner from the Constable. They
struck Begerow.V who drew his revolver
and shot both men.- Before firing the
fatal shots he shot oncg into the air. Be
gerow was drunk at the time. He was
roughly handled by the crowd that gath
ered and but for the prompt work of
Sheriff Langford and his deputies he prob
ably would have been lynched. The Con
stable claims he killed the men in Belf
defense, and fired only after he had
warned them to desist and they had
threatened to kill him.

him. Hamilton was not there. The wit
ness continued:
"I rubbed Day's other hand, and then
returned to the bar for brandy. Failing
to get any, I returned" to the side' of the
dying man and found Hamilton and Can
field there. I told Hamilton to slap Day's
hands and take off his shoes and rub his
feet, as his extremities were getting cold.
Neither Hamilton nor Canfleld said any
thing. <I said, 'He: is dying. 1 Hamilton
said, 'Is he?' and reached his hand over
Day's breast. We continued to rub his
feet and apply hot water. About ten min
utes afterward the doctor came in, and
five- minutes later Day died. I said, 'Let
us offer a prayer.' I kneeled down, and
so did Hamilton by my side. The prayer
was a silent one. An officer came and
stood beside Hamilton and. Canfleld: I did
not hear Hamilton say anything to the
officer. I had no knife, nor had Barbee.
Neither of us had any trouble In the room
with any one." : \ - Â¦
On cross-examination,' Bennett'- said
there were fifteen, or twenty persons in
the room at the time. There was a row
going on in another part of the apartment.
He had known ' Barbee about six weeks
and had met Day casually.
Stephen O'Malley. v/atchman at the
West Hotel, gave Important evidence. He
saw. Hamilton on top of Day, but saw no
blows struck. Indeed, it is remarkable
that not a single witness thus far saw a
blow strack by Hamilton.
O'Malley arrested Hamilton on the ad
vice of Canfleld, who was one of the pris
oner's companions, but who said to him:
"Hold that man." Hamilton said not a
word up to the time O'Malley turned him
over to Policeman Rooney, to whom the
State charges i hat he made a confession.
O'Malley identiiied a big wooden-handled
knife, with one rusty blade, as the one he
picked up near Day's body.
â¢ On cross-examination the watchman
mentioned for the first time In the case
"a mysterious stranger, a slim, tall man.
with iron-gray mustache, weighing about
150 pounds," standing near a billiard table.
This bit of evidence greatly pleased the
defense.
Dr. Henry S. Nelson, formerly Coroner,
described the cuts on the body, identified
the knife and declared, after the defense's
objections had been overruled, that the
blade of the knife could have caused the
cuts. - -'-Â¦: -- - . ~ Â¦
J. T. Gray, a boarder at the West Hotel,
gave some unexpected evidence. He had
been attracted to the billiard-room by
hearing that some one had been hurt,' and
had gone In twice. Each time Day was
lying on the floor. ,The first time there
was no knife by his body, but the second
time there was.
The sensation of the day was the calling
of Carrie Slagle as a witness. She said
she had known both Day and Hamilton
for about three months. " She admitted
having visited Hamilton in Jail, and said
she was still on friendly terms with him.
Asked if she had had a certain conver
sation with Hamilton before the tragedy,
she turned to the Judge and said:
"I understood that it is privileged."
The defense insisted that the witness
be instructed that she not testify to any
thing that might tend\to incriminate her
self. At least the State should" -^nut Its
questions In writing and submit them to
the court before they were put to the wit
ness. After a consultation between the
court and -the lawyers, the court ruled
that if the evidence tended to Incriminate
the witness she need not answer.
Mr, Penney asked if she was intimately
connected with either Day or Hamilton.
She said she was not, and was then ex
cused. '
: After recalling: -two witnesses to ; clear
up some minor points court adjourned for
the day.

the witness stand and was examined by
Judge Laird. She testified that she lived
at the Chinese mission. 916 Washington

work of the Chinese slave girls.
"What do you know of the slavery and
the traffic In the girls?" /
"Slavery exists in Chinatown. This I
know from the statements of the girls
made to me after they were rescued."
"Is it difficult to rescue these girls?"
"Most difficult. The keepers of the slave
dens have white men who act as watch
men. It is impossible for me to get to
the girls on account of the watchmen
Sometimes we get word from the unfortu
nate girls' that they want to get away
and designate a time when the watchman
is not likely to be near the house. It is
harder now than at any time to get at the
girls. There are five or six watchmen
employed and paid by the keepers of the
dens. Any time that I go into the alleys

watchmen prevent me from enterlne thp

AWFTJTi CONDITION OF
CHINESE SLAVE GIRLS
Officer Davis then said that he had heard
rumors as to police corruption of former
Chinatown squads, but he had not asked
to be relieved last year for fear his repu
tation might suffer.
Both Officers Connor and Davis testified
to taking part in the raid made last' Sat
urday night on a gambling place In Chi
natown, when ninety-five Chinese were
captured, together Â¦with the Implements
used in the fantangame.
Police Officer J. Wade gave similar tes
timony to his brother officers, and his rea
son for asking to be relieved last year
from the squad was that he had caught a
severe cold and wanted to go back to his
regular detail.
Sergeant McManus then took the stand
and was examined by Chairman Know
land. The witness testified as follows:
â¢'I have been on the police force since
1SS4. I succeeded Sergeant Mahoney In
charge of the Chinatown squad. I did not
hear of corruption in Mahoney's squad. 1
never visited the Chinese Consul General
to discuss with him alleged corruption of
the police by Chinese. 1 would certainly
remember t>uch an occurrence. I know the
gamblers called Big Jim. Buckeye and
San Jose Charlie. I read in the papers
about these men having collected a cor
ruption fund, but never heard of it else
where."
"Was an attempt ever made to bribe
you?"
"No. never."
"Did you ever hear of any attempt to
bribe members of your squad being made
by Chinese?"
"No. sir; never."
"Did you aak to be relieved from duty
in Chinatown?"
"I did."
â¢â¢why?" :;.'v
"Because the work was very hard and
I never wanted to go into Chinatown.
There has been so much talk In the papers
about bribery of the police by Chinese
that I did not want to go up there and
have my reputation at stake. I would not
do duty in Chinatown lor an Indefinite
period even for the salary' of the Chief of
Police. The public generally believe In the
stories of corruption."
"Do you know of any officer ever hav
ing been offered money by Chinege?"
"No, I do not."
"Have you any reason to suspect that a
corruption fund exists among the, Chinese
gamblers and \Mave-dealers?"
"No, I have not. I have never talked with
any member of the Police Department
about corruption in Chinat n, or with
any attorneys for the Chinee. I never
made a suggestion to my superiors as to
regulating gambling in Chinatown."
"Have you made many arrests in China
town?"
"There is not a single lottery place that
I have not raided at some time. I have
even raided private houses in the search
for the tickets. I never hesitated to make
a raid on the gambling places. I did not
wait for orders from my superiors. I was
in Chinatown in charge of the squad and
to do my duty, and I think I did It."

give before this committee."
foIJce Officer John W. Davis was asked
the same questions as asked of the pre
vious witness and Davis gave the same
kind of testimony. He had asked to be re
lieved last year from the Chinatown squad
because he had poisoned his foot and
wanted to be on duty shorter hours. The
witness was also not satisfied with the
orders of Sergeant Mahoney as to the
squad doing duty singly.
"I wanted to have another officer. with
me all the time, because the Chinese fre
quently put up jobs and I wanted to have
a witness wherever I went. It is a favor
ite trick of the Chinese to wrongly accuse
an officer."
The first witness called in the morning
was Police Officer Robert Connor, and In
reply to questions by Assemblyman Schll
lig. the witness said:
"I have been on the police force for six
years. I was a member of the Chinatown
Fquad on three occasions. I served in
1SX. 1899 and 1900. I have never talked
with my most intimate friends about cor
ruption of the police in Chinatown. I
atked to be relieved last year from the
squad because I had previously been on
Â«!uty In Chinatown and did not think it
fcir that I should be put back there. It
is not a fact that I asked to be relieved
on account of corruption in the squad. I
never saw anything in Chinatown to cause
me to fear that people would have a sus
picion that 1 was receiving money. My
only reason In asking to be relieved was
that the work was very hard and the
hours of duty very long. 1 made many
crrefcis of lottery keepers on my own ac
count. 1 never arrested any fantan play

Various Reasons Given for Not
OFFICERS DISLIKE
CHINATOWN' DETAIL
THE leirislative investigators of
the police held three long ses
sions yesterday, examined more
witnesses than on any other
day and learned less of mate
rial value to their primary pur
pose than at any other meeting-
During the morning session an effort
was made to show that different police
patrolmen, mho at various times were
members of the Chinatown squad, knew
of charges and insinuations cf fraud and
bribery and corruption, and for the Fake
of their own reputations had asked to be
relieved from duty in the district. Offi
cers Robert Connor. John W. Davis and
Arthur T. McQuaid and Sergeant Ber
nard McManus were placed on the wlt
r.Â«*5s stand, but not one of them would
afimit that he knew of corruption or had
ever had reason to suspect blackmail.
Connor declared that he was relieved
from duty in Chinatown at his own re
quest. Davis said that he did not like
Sergrar.t Mahoney's method of detailing
patrolmen slnply instead of in pairs, as
opportunity wris given for the Chinese to
$>rinp ur.founded charges, and. further,
the work of the Sfjuad was rendered in
effectual. McQuaid had nothing material
to offer, and Sergeant McManus was cm-
I'hutic in hie assertion that he knew noth
ing definite of alleged corruption. He de
clared that s'jFpIcion falls upon every
< fficer who is assigned to duty in the dis
trict, and very frequently this suspicion
is without foundation. Nothing, there
fore, of value was obtained from the wit
ness cJncers.
The committee then sought to learn
more of the local traffic in Chinese slave
girls. The subject appears to have Inter
ested the Invet=t:{rators deeply and they
are striving In every possible way to
learn as much as they may. They prom
ise even to po to the various missions and
take the testimony of slave girls who
have been rescued. Two women mieslon
arus. Mips Margaret Lake and Miss Don
aldina Cameron, were witnesses anJ
ewore that the difficulties of suppressing
the tOave traffic are becoming greater,
owing to the fact . that the . Chi
cese employ white watchmen. These
white guards will not permit the mission
aries to Ret near the slave tirls. Miss
Leke has even disguised herself in order
to get near the slave girls and attempt to
rescue them.
Chinese girls, she declared, are sold not
onl3* to lives of shame but also to do
mestic service. The police, the witness
haid, are always willing to assist in get
ting possession of slave girls, but every
time they- do assist the slave girls are in
vanalily lost. Jerome Alillard, the inter
preter, was charged with being an agent
and representative of the slave dealers,
und in his capacity as interpreter he does
not translate correctly.
Miss Cameron gave some interesting
testimony in reference to Baker alley ana
the high fencts which recently have been
erected to inclose it. The property thu^
inclosed belongs to the Sullivan estate,
and Miss Cameron declares that the bar
riers now keep her from getting near the
slave girls. By erecting these barriers
the Biave dealers protect their human
chattels. The committee declared its pur
pose to visit the missions and take fur
ther testimony on the subject.
One of the interesting witnesses of the
day . was S. S. Leong. a Chinese who
served as telephone operator in China
town until he struck for wages. He made
the startling assertion that on two occa
fcione he saw Sergeant LJrophy in fantan
gambling houses drinking Intoxicants as
the guest of the owners. While the ser
geant was so occupied, the witness said
fantan was in progress in an adjoining
room, the connecting door being open.
Thib was supposed to have taken place
at Jackson snd Dupont streets and at 7
Rots ajley. There appears to be only one
drawback to this Â¦ startling testimony.
Sergeant Brophy has never drunk an in
toxicant in his life and can prove it. %
Immigration Commissioner Hart North;
Yokota, a Japanese lodging house keeper;
Sergearit James Donovan, Sergeant Chris
tensen and Officer Thomas C. Murphy
were T.-itnesses, but testified to nothing
material.
At the conclusion of the afternoon se*
eion the committee took the testimony of
Chinese slave girls at the Methodist and
Presbyterian migsitms. and at night sev
eral police officers were examined on
points which developed nothing of lm
portance.
The Police Department also attempted the theatrical last night and patrolled every allev in China
to&n, keeping every club and gambling-house open to inspection. This, hown'er, did not stop' the coolies
from gambling. The investigation is now nearing its end, and there appears to be practically no hope
that definite proof of corruption, will be found.
Further than this no witness could swear. It was the same in reference to the evidence on gam
bling. That it exists there is no question; but that the police permit it to exist no witness has been able to
swear. The inquiry has progressed no further than this. Last night the police suspected that the Exam
iticr intended to publish a sensational article announcing that several Chinese witnesses zvho are notori
ous gamblers had been spirited away. Representatives of the newspaper and a Deputy Sheriff jive re
searching for them all day, but claimed to be unable to find them. Captain Wittman detailed an officer
last night to find the gamblers, and, to the chagrin of the amateur detectives, the coolies were at the Hall
of Justice in fifteen minutes.
FHE lcgislatiz'e investigators who are trying to discover whether the Police Department is cor
rupt in its dealings with the Chinese were treated yesterday to an elaborate explanation _of the
slave trade in Chinese girls as it exists in this city. Mvst<fff the facts presented were new only
to the committee â the people of San Francisco have known them for years. Women missionaries testi
fied that Chinese girls are bought and sold in San Francisco as so much merchandise, and that the police
arc apathetic when their assistance is asked to suppress the terrible trade. The Chinese have shown re
markable craft, and employ white mm to be the keepers and guards of their human property.
The names of the girls were not made
public, as it is feared they might come to
harm at the. hands of the slave-dealers
who formerly owned! them.
One girl stated that her parents in this
city, had sold her. to slavery when she
was 15 years old. the purchase price being
$1900. She testified that she had seen the
deposit of $300 counted out in her presence
and paid to her. parents. She told of be
ing forced' to .lead a life of shame in a 
slave den, and how she had escaped to the
mission home last October. '
v Another girl told the committee that she
had been sold in this city for the sum of
$2200. She ha4 been also forced into a life
of shame/ and white men had frequented
the den in which she had been detained.
She also had recently made her escape.
*A third girl who escaped from the slave
dealers five years ago told the committee
that she had been sold Jay her parents
in this city for $2800. She had seen the de
posit of the purchase money, amounting
to $300, counted out and paid in her pres
ence.; Â¦ _' -â¢ .' .Â¦'Â¦Â¦..-Â¦ .' .," Â¦ . Â¦-" '-Â¦Â¦- . ."-i
The ladies of the mission produced three
lfttle children who had been rescued from
the slave dens. " The ladles of the mission
had ; watched '. these , girls .' from the time
they were born, and found. that they were
sold i to : the : slave-dealers when 3, months
old for $100 and $150 each. The slave-deal

Sergeant H. H. j Christensen was j then
called to the witness stand and waa ex
amined by Chairman Knowland. The
witness stated that ha had been on the
police force for more than ten years and
had served in Chinatown for four years.
He told the same story as the previous
witness as to the dlfflcultles which beset
the police in the suppression of gambling
among the Chinese.
"It is hard to get into tho places, hard
to get the evidence and then it is hard to
convict the men we have arrested." #
The witness then entered into details of
the raid made^ last Saturday night, when
a large number of Chinese were caught.
The cases of the men arrested for playing
fantan are still in the courts.
" "Who is the attorney defending the
men?" < . â. .
"An attorney by the name ot Shorts
ridge.''
"What Is his full name?" i<v - : A.' v i-'
"I don't know: it is an attorney by tho
name of Shortrldge."
Attorney Dunneâ There is only one at
torney at the bar by the name of Short-
F cfi^irman Knowlandâ At the legal bar.
This repartee on the part of 'Mr. Know
land raised a loud laugh In the room.
Police Officer T. C. Murphy was the last
witness called at the afternoon session.
He testified that he had been an officer
for seven years and had served on the
Chinatown squads under Sergeants Ma
honey and Shea. "No one ever attempted
to bribe me, either a white man or a Chi
nese. While I was in Chinatown I helped
to raid many fantan games."
At this point Chairman Knowland an
nounced that as the supply of witnesses
was exhausted for the afternoon the com
mittee would take the opportunity of vis
iting the Chinese Mission and taking the
testimony of the slave girls rescued from
the dens of Chinatown.
At the evening session of the investiga
tion committee but little, evidence was
forthcoming of any material value. A
number of police officers testified that on
January 1 last 'they had received orders
from their superior officers that the doors
of the downstairs gambling places in Chi
natown should be kept open, but no orders
were given as to .the gambling-rooms up-
St Tho* officers testified that last Sunday
afternoon they were instructed that the
gambling places upstairs were also to he
kept open.
The officers who were called to the
stand were: J. J. â¢ Rlley. Â¦ E. Curry J.
Isaacs, J. Merchant, George Oxon, J. TV.
Scott, H. H. Hicks, E. H. Murphy E.-J.
McNamara, G. F. Barry and C. B. Kasslg.
After the police officers had testified
Chairman Knowland announced that as
there were no more witnesses in attend
ance the investigation would be adjourned
until this morning at 10 o'clocX. In an
nouncing the adjournment Chairman
Knowland said that subpenas had been
issued for five Chinese, who are the lead
ing gamblers In Chinatown, and asked
Deputy Sheriff Murphy if he had been
able to find the men. The deputy an
swered that he had not been able to do so.
though he had made diligent search for
Reporter Boyle. of the Examiner volun
teered a statement that he had accompa
nied the deputy sheriff to the addresses of
the Chinese and that it was larned that
the men. had left the cfty, b ;lng afraid to
come before the committee.
. When I Chairman Knowland adjourned
the session Captain Wittman went to Mr.
Knowland and asked for the subpenas.
"I will find these men in a little while,"
Captain Wittman said. "I don't believe
these Chinese have left town. It is all rot,
and' I will get them here If it takes every
man In my command to find them." . â¢
Iri a few minutes Sergeant Donovan,
who had been sent to Chinatown to look
for the Chinese, returned with Big Chlng
Qwong Hlng and San. Jose Charlie. The
three Chinese laughed at the idea of their
leaving town, and promised Mr. Know
land that - they would be on hand this
morning and bring witn , them Buckeye
and Wong Fook, who. are also wanted to
testify. . a
Â¦ The ease with which Sergeant Donovan
found the Chinese seems to indicate that
the young sleuth of the yellow "monarch
of the dallies" did not take the deputy
sheriff to the proper places where the Chi
nese could be found, and that Captain
.Wittman .In finding the Chinese had
spoiled another sensational "story-"
Chairman Knowland; after the adjourn
ment of . the -.committee, gave out to the
press the result of the examination of the
rescued slave girls, taken in the afternoon
at the Chinese mission.

A. Yokota. a Japanese, living at o26.Plne
street, was then examined by Mr. Schillie.
Kota said that he could speak English,
but his | examination haH not proceeded
far before he demanded an interpreter.
All that he testified to was that he kept
a â¢ lodging-house and -did . not know "any
police officers by name. Yokota will be ex
amined again, when an interpreter will
be in attendance.-
Sergeant James T. Donovan then testi
fied that ho had been on the police force
for fourteen years and had only been In
charge of the Chinatown squad for nye
months. He told the familiar story of the
difficulty of stopping gambling among
Chinese and the heavy doors, spring
locks, cellars artkl Intricate ways of escape
used by the Celestials to escape from the
police. He thought that a law allowing
doors of certain thickness in Chinatown
might aid the officers. It would help them
in- getting into the raided houses in
quicker, time. Â¦,
