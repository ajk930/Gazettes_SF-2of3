MY EXPERIENCE AS A SUPE -
BEHIND THE SCENES
WITH BERNHARDTMme. Sembrich did "so, and after that
her Polish songs were .a- regular feature
of her appearances in St. Petersburg. But
In other parts of Russia they were not so

"But. your Majesty. -I can sing Chopin
only In Polish," .she. answered. ' .Â»
"Why, sing It in Polish, of course," he
rejoined. . ..,,.,. .. , Â¦ ' .
She sang the first song in the Polish lan
guage that had been heard for many
years In St. Petersburg. She sang as an
encore once a song of Chopln's/and to her
astonishment the audience in the opera
house heard ( lt with great enthusiasm; It
was after thlÂ» -that 'she went; to the im
perial palace to sing for Alexander. II.; He
asked her to sing Fome of Chopin's songs.
"The end of it all was: that before I left
Bayreuth it was' settled that the concert
was not to be In Bismarck'B honor. That
promise was made 'positively. When -I
Â¦went to LeipÂ«lc-I was anxious to see how
the programme would be printed. Iw'as

came back that ivwas perfectly correct
that the concert was Intended as a memo

ncjunced-to sing the "Casta Diva" from
â¢''Xorma," and tho letter written from
I>eipsic to confirm the telegram contained
.the information that the b!ow movement
in*that was thought to be especially suit
ed to such a concert. V
"I had no desire to Join in any memorial
to honor. Bismarck," Mme. Sembrlch said,
"and I knew that my own people would
never forgive me If my name appeared on
the programme of the Gewandhaus'as the
: soloist of a concert given In his memory.
I immediately telegraphed fronwBayreuth,
where I was then stopping, that it- would
be out of the question for me' to appear.'
I begged them to. engage another soloist,

Polish musical people' known to this coun

Paderewskl. She is a loyal Pole, although
she does not spend much of hÂ«r time ; n

told which show* her loyalty better than
any assurances on her" part .ever could.
"It is In Russia that the purely Italian
opera is kept up in better fashion than In
any other place. The Impresario gives
yearly a season of about two months*
duration. The best of the^Italian singers
are brought there and the productions aro
the most elaborate made anywhere fn
Europe. Wagner's works have not taken
the same hold there with the public that
they have In the other European coun â¢
tries. Some of them are 'eung In Italian,
but the season is devoted chiefly to the
old classic Italian .works. When I Bay
Italian I mean of the Italian school as
well. Meyerbeer and Gounod are. of
course, popular. The enormous prices
paid In St. Petersburg and Moscow enable
the Impresarios to obtain the very beat
singers from Italy. In the smaller towns,
too, the gains to a popular singer aro very
great. But one must be known and liked.
Then there Is more wealth. for them In
Russia than In any ; other country in
Europe." . , .".
"One thing which seems strange to me
about this country." Mme. Sembrich said,
"is that the majority of people here *eetn
to know of only two opera-houses in
Europe. These 'are Covon't Garden and
Bayreuth. As the Covent Garden season
only continues for a month* or two In the
summer, I have wondered What became of
the European singers during the rest of
the time. And at Bayreuth the perform
ances are not even given every year. Only
the Wagner singers go thore as a general
rule. Yet several persons have askod me,
'Where have you beÂ«?n, madam, j for the
past ten years V I say In St. Petersburg,
which is, of course, a long distance away
from New Tork. at the Imperial Opera iiÂ»
Vienna. In Berlin and in Madrid. .Yet of
those places Americans eay nothing anl.
rarely eeem to have heanVof them. I have
not sung In London for three years. After
my long seasons on the Continent I was
usually so tired that the trip from my
home in Dresden to London never seemed
worth the while for the few performances
that the artists usually give there. The
EingerB rarely appear oftener than threo
or four times, and that is not worth a trip
from Dresden to L>ondon and back again. r
"But for years I have continued my
Etudies as a' singer. I ptill practice one
hour every day at the piano and devote
the same amount of time to singing. Th.-it
hour, however.. I divide into four. part-?,
and sing for' only fifteen minutes at a
time. That is the history < I my musical
s'udies. It Is almost Impossible to say
when they began. My fingers Tvere on tho_
piano keys long before I could stretch an
octave. My studies have not ended yet
and I cannot tell when they will. The
person who 'would continue to kerp a
place in music must always struggle to
improve. It is not enough to ke<*p up to
one's own standard. There must be con
stant effort at something hotter.
But I retired for nearly two years after
that time. I was ctiU so young that there
was plenty, of time to complete* my educa
tion in a way that should be satisfactory
to me and my facher. So I went to Dres
den and when I sang again it was in the
Royal Opera-house.
"I had to sign a paper, however, prom
ising that I would never sing in Polish
again in Vllna, and at my second concert
I left out the Chopin songs. Every year
I have gone to Vllna and every time the
Chief of Police comes to me with the
same paper to sign, and every time I
have to sign the promise that I will not
sing in Polish. I have got to know the
Governor very wejl and he calls to see me
as. soon as I get to Vllna. But he has
got into the habit of asking me what my
ttacores will be. Only last April, when I
morning the Chief of Ponce came to my
hotel. I had one more concert to give.

The right whale has been nearly exter

attention to hunting the reindeer with
their crude weapons. The animal is com

small part in the domestic economy of
the Arctic highlanders.
"'Now, for ten or twelve years past

large numbers of walrus in order to take
their skins and skeletons back home to
the museums. No attention whatever.

the main source of food for the natives

Is the general opinion among those who

After a family consultation it was decid

there under a well-known teacher named

AMONG- the most common diseases
of the skin are acne and eczema,
one of which is known to be. and
the other probably is, the result of
the presence of a miciobe on or In the
Â¦kin. This microbe Is a vegetable growth,
although a very minute one, and, like
other noxious weeds, when once it has
been planted and has begun to grow it is
often extremely difficult to dislodge It.
Every fanner^knows that it is easier to
keep a field clean by constant care than
to clear it after it has once been over
grown with weeds. It is the same with
the skin. It is easier to keep the skin In
health, and .to arrest a commencing' dis
ease than to cure a disease once it has
become firmly established.. .
If it were generally understood that the
presence of a few pimples constitutes a
true skin disease, which, if neglected, will
probably grow worse, fewer person*
would suffer frcm the disfigurement of
acne.
The skin Is much like the system in
general: if It is in good condition it will
repel the assaults of disease, but if neg
lected it becomes less resistant and soon
offers a favorable soil for the growth of
noxious germs.
The skin Is one of the so-called ex
cretory organs, and If the other organs
of similar functionsâ the kidneys and the
bowelsâdo not perform their! work prop
erly, an undue proportion of the waste
products of the body must be got rid of
through the pores of ' the skin. This
throws work upon the Integument which
It Is not accustomed to perform and If
soon becomes diseased in consequence.
The first thins neqessary to' keen the
skin well is to maintain the health of tha
body by exercise, cleanliness, fresh air
day and night, good food properly cooked,
a sufficient amount of sleep and suitabta
clothing. In addition to these general
measures the skin Itself should receive
'special attention In the way of a dally
bath, followed by vigorous rubbing with a
coarse towel or flesh brush.
Some persons have naturally clear skins
while 9thers appear to have a special
predisposition to blackhead* and pimple*.
The fortunate ones must see to it that
they do not mar what nature has given
them by an unhygienic mode of life: bet
the others need not despair, for their
tendency to eruptions may often bÂ« over
come by scrupulous care both of thÂ» body
and of the skin itself, after the manner
above Indicated, and in such other ways
as the physician may direct. â Youth's

EXCELLENT ADVICE ON CARE OP THE SKIN
The evening gown Is a Worth creation,

does. Others have style, taste, art even;
this has inspiration. There never was a

and black velvet. The chiffon ' Is fluted
and ruffled with itself, and It fluffs out
around the feet in a gray cloud mass. The
tucks are the tiniest that deft fingers can
make. They appear on waist, sleeves and
at the hips. The Parisian artist' believes
that there is no way so sure to achieve a
perfect fit over the hips. Narrow black
velvet ribbon bands circle the collar. The
â¢ame ribbon is knotted into a bow at the
bust and gathered Into a belt.
The hat for this gown Is a soft white
hind.
The sleeve is a model for the dressy
sleeve of the year. Its pleats', in groups of
threes, reach from shoulder to elbow,
there to be loosened into a short ruffle.

women to whom the black boa is more

The Truth About the Philippines.

that he would like to show him the portrait ot

plainest of whit* muslin frocks, with her hair
l.rushed back from h-r brow and a narrow
Mack ribbon tied around her throat. The
Prince Immediately asked the r.a:ne of the
original, when the you'ngr officer discovered that
by mistake he had Riven the Prince the portrait
of the Kinc of Denrflark - s second daughter.
When the mistake was explained. the Prince re
fused to return the photocraph, and a few
dars later, on seeing a miniature of the" same
lady tn the Duchess of Cambridge's drawing

The author holds that if one wishes ta
know the wild flowers really they must
visit them in their haunts, for tha more
exquisite the flower the more completely
does It lose its characteristics when sep
arated from its natural surroundings.
The fifty full-page illustrations are also
made from this point of. view, being ex
tremely beautiful photographs of flowers,
ferns, vines, etc.. taken as they grew,
by the author and by J. Horace McFar
land, the numerous marginal engravings
being also from direct photography, the
work of securing the subjects in the right
condition having taken over two years.
There are also many drawings In the text.
From the countless books npon natlrt/
flowers that hava been Issued during tha
past half dozen years it would seem
that they had been viewed from every
possible side, yet Mrs. Mabel Osgood,
Wright In her forthcoming bookâ "Tha
Flowers and Ferns in Their Haunts"
(Macmillan)â treats them from a wholly
new standpoint. The flower Is not con
sidered merely as an aggregation of
calyx, corolla, stamens and pistil that
leads to Its correct naming, or from tha
complex mechanism that calls for the aid
of Insects to insure Its fertilization, but
for its value as a part of the landscape.

"Memoir of a Naughty Girl." As tha
literary critic of the New York Press has

Townsend Brady's new novel. "When
Blades Are Out and Love's Afield"; "A
Cabinet Secret." by Guy Boothby. deals
primarily with conditions brought about
in connection with the South African war,
and Is designed to show what, under
certain, doubtless improbable, conditions,
might very well have happened, had a
secret power endeavored to harass tha
empire by taking advantage of her tem
porary difficulties; every character and in
cident Is avowedly fictional. "Sweetheart
Manette" is from the pen of Maurice
Thompson, whose "Alice of Old Vin
cennes" has recently brought his name so
promin-ntly again before the public. Mrs.
Hugh Fraser (a sister of Marion Craw
ford), whose "Splendid Por3enna" was an
important work last winter, contributes
"A Little Gray Sheep." and " General
Charles King's "In Spite of Foes" and
John Strange Winter's "The Career of a
Beauty" complete the group.

"The Toltec Savior." a historical ro
mance of ancient Mexico, by Mrs. John

Literary Notes.
E. S. Chamberlayne has a striking story
in the February Atlantic describing th*
meeting of a man with the man he might
have been. It Is called "Mr. Smedley'*
Guest."
The trans-Rocky reviewers, who really
know a coyote from a cowboy, say that
â¢Mrs. Kelly's "With Hoods of Steel" is
a ripping good story. And speaking of
"ripping," Conan Doylo once av-erred that
"the best critic Is the boy who reads a,
book and pronounces It either ripping or
no good."

Nevertheless the tales represent some
very claver work and deserve a creditable
place among Indian short stories. They
are all strong and partake of the pathetic.
There Is no marked effort at plot, but
each one is a pastel in prose. "With tho
exception of the "Vanishing City of Tam
alpais" they % dear with Indian subjects
and present excellent pictures of their
peculiar superstitions, apparently stoical
indifference and rigid adherence to tribal
laws. "The Vanishing City of Tarnalpais"
is a pretty legend concerning Mount
Tamalpals. which, while of merit. Is hard
ly up to the standard of others in the book.
The story, of "Kwelth-Ellteâ The Proud
Slave," is probably the most virile, but
is rather weakened by a prosaic ending.
It Is a story of witchcraft and Indian re
venge, with a final climax of an attempt
on the part of the tribe to bury alive the
dusky heroine. (Published by The Neely

It Is unfortunate that these stories ap

The Truth About the Philippines.
There has Just been published a refer
ence review of our island possessions , en
titled, "The Truth About the Philip
pines." by H. H. .Van Meter. Mr. Van
A yonng German officer who was a friend of
the Princo informed hll Koya! Hlzhness rnt
day ihst he wes encase.d t'> be married and
that he would like to show him the portrait ot
his l)rtdÂ»-*iect. He rave tins Prince a photo
irrarjh of a beautiful young Slrl wearing the
plainest of whit* muslin frocks, with her hair
l.rushed back from h-r brow and a narrow
Mack ribbon tied around her throat. The
Prince Immediately asked the r.a:ne of the
original, when the you'ngr officer discovered that
by mistake he had Riven the Prince the portrait
of the Kinc of Denrflark - s second daughter.
When the mistake was explained. the Prince re
fused to return the photocraph, and a few
dars later, on seeing a miniature of the" same
lady tn the Duchess of Cambridge's drawing
room, he declared there and then that he would
marry only the original of these two pictures.
The 'following is rjiven as the etiquette
of personal calls by or on the Prince:
Affr this portrayal of life at Sandrinp
ham ar.d Marlborough the author devotes
himself entirely to chapters of a per
sonal nature, such as domestic life, "the
Prince as a student, the Prince in soci
ety, the Prince's" set. the Prince as a
churchman, the Prince at play, the Prln.ce
as a. patron, the Prince on the course,
the love of his life, the Prince and his
clothes, what the Prince eats and drinks,
the^Jfrince as a Freemason, the Prince as
a Rood fellow and the Prince r.s a son.

The writer evidently possesses a very
Intimate knowledge of the affairs of his
Prince, for even the smallest details of
hours for Ctnir.s. the position at table of
different members of the family, the
Princes little hobby of playing bowls, are
set forth. It Is this knowledge which
gives the book Its peculiar value, for It
shows us England's ruler as the man and
not as the potentate. Knowing him as an
ordinary living and breathing mortal like
the rest of us will pive a better idea of
his worth as a monarch than any amount
of matter written on his appearance at
public functions wherein the true man is

Nevertheless the tales represent some
very claver work and deserve a creditable
place among Indian short stories. They
are all strong and partake of the pathetic.
There Is no marked effort at plot, but
each one is a pastel in prose. "With tho
exception of the "Vanishing City of Tam

peculiar superstitions, apparently stoical
indifference and rigid adherence to tribal
laws. "The Vanishing City of Tarnalpais"
is a pretty legend concerning Mount
Tamalpals. which, while of merit. Is hard

The story, of "Kwelth-Ellteâ The Proud

is rather weakened by a prosaic ending.

In fact, play is largely the business of
life in the Birdie Bell republic. True, the
youthful citizens have their official du

Junior republic, cares do not weigh

"I believe In play, plenty of play for chil
dren," says Dr. Stow. Horace Greeley
once said to me, when I was an officer in
the American Woman's ; Association for
the Protection of Shop Girls in New York
City, 'Let the girls earn their own living,
as I have done since I was five years old.*

a child of that age could accomplish. But
it was not the beat thing, Mr. Greeley,

should have his or her rightful inherit

years, and some time I will make a little
play spot where no thought of the stove,

shall ever enter to mar and begrime Its
brightness, Joy, lovt and beauty.' "
Dr. Btow is now 72 years of age, but she
!s as well preserved, bright and active
as a woman of 50. "I am now in the youth
of old age, 72 years young," is Dr. Stow'.s

Stow, a cousin of Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Iir.-Stow intends that the Birdie Bell
republic shall do as much for freeing chil

The Birdie Bell republic has a constitu

our own Government. The boy and girl
citizens have their tum at go\-eming an<l

Dr. Stow is a stanch believer in

political rights. The presidential plum In
the political pie !s as free to the lassies as

President of the United States on the
Woman's Suffrage ticket in 18S1.

1S37. The cornerstone in the spacious

"Capitol." was laid by Dr. Stow, and be

this BIrCIe Bell republic. And It's only a
blown-ln-the-bottle cvnlc who can listen
to venerable, motherly Dr. Stow and not
warm to her plans and Ideals. Of course,
there is a reason for her thus devoting her
life and household to children. A pathetic
reason that bares the unhealed wound In
the woman's heart, llar.y, many yean
ago. her only child, a winsome bonny
baby, just turning the corner of four
years, died in farawav Ohio. The baby
h3d been christened Frank Arthur, but
fomehow every one called him "Birdie
TJell." Even then there sprang up in the
bereft young mother's heart the hone that
Fnme day she might make it possible for
other children to gather up the broken
Fllken thread* where they fell from her
baby's fingers, and do his unfinished day's
work end play for him.
It was nearly half a century before this
hope v.-as fulfilled. Dr. Stow*s life In the
Interior was crowded with social and do
mestic duties. Even after the death cf
her husband. Joseph Wesley Stow, who

much dignity. These 'were the words that
gladdened the attentive citizens of the re

In fact, play is largely the business of
life in the Birdie Bell republic. True, the
youthful citizens have their official du
ties; but in such a model state as this
Junior republic, cares do not weigh
heavily on the "servants of the public."
"I believe In play, plenty of play for chil
dren," says Dr. Stow. Horace Greeley
once said to me, when I was an officer in
the American Woman's ; Association for
the Protection of Shop Girls in New York
City, 'Let the girls earn their own living,
as I have done since I was five years old.*
â¢Ah. Mr. Greeley.* I replied, 'the girls I
plead for are not all Greeleys; besides
they would gladly earn their bread tf
they could find something to do. I, too.
earned my living at five years of age on
the farm; learned to 6flln on the big wheel
and do all Eorts of household labor that
a child of that age could accomplish. But
it was not the beat thing, Mr. Greeley,
for either of us, believe me. A child
should have his or her rightful inherit
ance of play days, weeks, months and
years, and some time I will make a little
play spot where no thought of the stove,
wneel, loom, plow or any grinding toil
shall ever enter to mar and begrime Its
brightness, Joy, lovt and beauty.' "
Dr. Btow is now 72 years of age, but she
!s as well preserved, bright and active
as a woman of 50. "I am now in the youth
of old age, 72 years young," is Dr. Stow'.s
r-aive way of putting it. The citizens of

Stow, a cousin of Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Iir.-Stow intends that the Birdie Bell
republic shall do as much for freeing chil
dren from irksome toil as her cousin's pÂ«a
accomplished for the slaves.
The Birdie Bell republic has a constitu
tion and laws copied in miniature after
our own Government. The boy and girl
citizens have their tum at go\-eming an<l
V.cing governed. But unlike the children'*
Tf publics In New Tork the Birdie Bell citi
zens live with their parents, and thus es
cape many of the or.erous duties that fall
to the lot of the citizens of the Henry
George Junior republic
Dr. Stow is a stanch believer in
â¢woman suJfrag-e. and In the Juntcr repub
lic the girls are deprived of none cf their
political rights. The presidential plum In
the political pie !s as free to the lassies as
the lads. Dr. Stow, herself, ran for Vice
President of the United States on the
Woman's Suffrage ticket in 18S1.
.The Birdie Bell republic was founded in
1S37. The cornerstone in the spacious
frame building, which the children call the
"Capitol." was laid by Dr. Stow, and be
fore the paint on the buildimr was dry
over 190 children had *Ienified their wjll-
Irigness to become citizens. Now the polit
ical machinery of the republic Is so well
oiled that It rues without a creak, and
there Is little cf tlie strife and dissension
that rends "grown-up" republics.
It Is worth, going many a mile to see. Is
this BIrCIe Bell republic. And It's only a
blown-ln-the-bottle cvnlc who can listen
to venerable, motherly Dr. Stow and not
warm to her plans and Ideals. Of course,
there is a reason for her thus devoting her
life and household to children. A pathetic
reason that bares the unhealed wound In
the woman's heart, llar.y, many yean
ago. her only child, a winsome bonny
baby, just turning the corner of four
years, died in farawav Ohio. The baby
h3d been christened Frank Arthur, but
fomehow every one called him "Birdie
TJell." Even then there sprang up in the
bereft young mother's heart the hone that
Fnme day she might make it possible for
other children to gather up the broken
Fllken thread* where they fell from her
baby's fingers, and do his unfinished day's
work end play for him.
It was nearly half a century before this
hope v.-as fulfilled. Dr. Stow*s life In the
Interior was crowded with social and do
mestic duties. Even after the death cf
her husband. Joseph Wesley Stow, who
*Â»Â» one of the most honored and esteemed

The druggist finally announced that tha

him on with his overcoat and saw him
out on the street. He hadn't paced tho

"G-wayâ g'way from me!" Mr. Bowser
got up the strength to exclaim.
"Never, my conscience-stricken friend,

went up the street at a gallop several
people asked him where the fire was, and
a policeman jumped, out' from behind a

Two more doubts followed the first and he

When she had gone upstairs Mr. Bowser

traveling doctor and put up by his family
druggist, and, elevating the bottle, he took
a 1 hearty swig of the contents. He car

that his cold had been knocked Into tha

rupted that feeling. until he was In bed

"I hope you made no mistake about that

"How could I make a mistake?" he
asked in a dreamy way.

I did not know a single soul. Picking
up a Sunday morning paper. I saw that
Bishop Charles Mortimer Price of
the Episcopal Church was to ofll

â¢children were ta be christened. I read thÂ»
name of the Bi'hop again and againâ the
name uÂ«ed 1? not his name, thoughâ and
I was sure he must be an old friend whom
I knew thirty yoars before, when he was
just out of college and was assigned to
his flret parish. I went to the church,
heard him preach and saw him hand'e
â¢=o tenderly the little children that he was
taking the first step toward makln-
Christians of, and was sure he was my
old friend. After the services I went up
to the altar, and the janitor, or whatever
the man is that acts as teller In church,
told him a man wanted to see him. lie

"Charley," he raid "George," he put hi*
big white sleeve around me and led me
back Into his den, and ah the afternoon
we didn't do a thing but talk about old
times. One thing he paid will be used for
my text. He said: "George, I want to
know If that Dutch farmer down there
on the river ever learned the English lan
guage." I told him that the German did
learn Engllch, and eventually became rich
and a high public official, and the Bishop
seemed relieved, and I went away to my
train and left that part of the country.
But all that night, on the sleeper, I
thought of li-e Bishop that was to be ajid
the German of long ago.
I was publishing a country paper, hav
ing Jost completed learning the printer's
trade, and Price had learned hia trade
and was preaching. I had a wife, a gun
and a dog. He had a chestnut-colored
trotting horse and a buggy his father had
given him and was a bachelor. We got
acquainted over the trotting horse one.

from a hunt, and took me In to ride with
him, and his hors* trotted away down
below 2:30 until we got near town, when
It plowed down anil my friend- left oft
his appearance of sporty tendencies and
looked grave and pious, as became a
younsr minister.
Some days I would get Into my boat
with the dog and row upstream from the
town we lived In for a mile or two and
I would finally see tl^ minister at a bend
in the river waltinjr for me. Ho would
have on his long- Mack coat. buttoneÂ«l
with those small vest buttons an inch
apart from Genesi?. near Ji!s throat, to
Revelation, down near his belt, and I
would be In a hurry and think it would
take him half an heur to unbutton that
coat and get in the Loat. but as soon as
the solemn look left his faceâ the min
isterial look that he wore in townâ and
the "Charley" look, which meant an out
ing of fun. came t<- take its place he
would take hold of the collar and begin
to rip. the way a schoolboy unbuttons
his Fhoes when he is getting in swimming,
and for a second it would pound like a
distant volley of musketry "and the coat
would be unbuttoned all the way down,
and my ministerial comrade would appeal
In the moft disreputable old blue flannel
shirt that ever was. iioth-eaten and torn.

ber boots, stow the black coat away under
the forward deck, and I would row him
up the rivpr to a camp and we woui:

trees, shooting game and eatir.g such
meals.
One day we put my dog under the bug

my gun case out of sisht and Charily
drove leisurely out of town until we had
passed the last house and struck the
town. Charley shlva/lng with the cold,
and holding the dog on his legs to keep
warm. Luckily we got into town a Httla
after dark, so the minister could get into
his study without attracting too much at
tention, and the next Sunday I chained
Carlo up and went to church myself, and
there was -narley .with a brand new coat
and a choker collar, but all during hia
sermon I could only think of how he
would look In the pulpit as I saw him re
trieving my ducks, and hiding In the
v/eeds under the fence. And when I vis
ited my Charley, now a Bishop. In his
study In the Southern city, with littlo
English nlde-whiskcrs. and he took off his
coat, which was a dead ringer for the one
he wrapped around my dog, and he askej
me about our Carlo, and I told him how
an unhung villain had poisoned him years
before a tear came to his eye. and then
we took a small drink of something, be
cause the Bishop said he .felt a chill at
the thought of retrieving those ducks
from the cold river thirty years before.
"George." said ne. "your corning here
has ruined me. For a quarter of a cen

swallow of whatever it was in the glass,
and I went away laushlng, and left the
Bishop laughing, and there you are.
In a hurry, with their tails sticking up
and bellowing.
Th* old man saw the oxen running
away, and he and his wife and the girls
started on a run after them, and I got
Charley into some of his clothes, and we
hitched up the horse and started for

and he rushed Into the water, coat md

and put his paws on the minister's shoul

having a great time when I looked
.around and a German farmer, with his
wife and several grown-up girls on a lum
ber wagon, was comlntr toward i;g. I
yelled to Charley to come out and crawl
behind a barbed wire rence. which he .hist
had time to do. and then the old farmer
stopped to talk with me. the old lady
and the girls got out to help water thÂ«
oxen, and there was my minister under
the fence, shivering: his young llfe> away.
At first Carlo laid down under the fenrvÂ»

had got his coat out of the water, and
then Carlo saw that I had company, so

and went back to where Charley was hid

whole seven ducks, and that made the
girls want to go and see where Carlo had
got them, and I knew that would never do.

but the old farmer who couldn't rpeak

had been at his house and stolen some

scrape I did not know. The girls went
part way to the fence to protect their
father If he had any trouble with the
tramp, so their backs were toward me. My
gun was loaded and I got behind the oxen

looked up as though I had shot at some

THE BISHOP WHO RETREIVED
MR. BOWSER'S TRIBULATIONS.ligion is chierly concerned. The Bible, for
example, prohibits certain acts and
courses of conduct and prescribes certain
others without always giving the why and
wherefore of so doing. The reason is not
far to seek. It came to the knowledge
of one man at a given time and place
or to a few men at different places and
various timesâ whether by inspiration or
experience matters not to our present
purpose â that certain things were good for
men to do and certain other things the
reverse. Therefore, certain commands
and prohibitions for the government of
men were framed and promulgated. Some
of these dealt with the motives and prin
ciples of conduct and others with words
and acts only. The closeness of relation
that existed between the Creator and his
creatures in the most ancient ideas and
forms of Bible religion sufficiently ac-
counts for the divine sanction and ulti
mate authority assumed by those prohibi
tions and commands. In proportion as it
came to be understood or believed that
God had enacted laws of human conduct,
obedience to those laws came to be re
garded as righteousness and disobedience
as sin. In the religious sense of the term,
therefore, roughly speaking, Bin is neither
more nor less than moral perversity. "To
him that knoweth to do good and doeth
it not,' to him it is sin." is a familiar Bible
text As the proper sphere of religion is
the spiritual in man it naturally belongs
to the offices of religion to dear with the
moral Qualities of human conduct And'
now, as ever in the past, moral perversity
is intrinsically the worst quality of hu
man sin, as It is also the worst In' its

mankind. Our sins of ignorance are many

and agony which is the dally and hourly

Foul spite doing Its dirty work, base slan

are these but the natural effects of active

when it describes the heart as "deceitful
above all things and desperately wlckeu t"
If every human being always followed the
best promptings of his nature these things
would soon cease to be, the work of moral
education would be lightened as if by a
miracle and peace and harmony would
flood the world as naturally as does
morning light from the ascending sun.
Here, however, we reach a point
'Where collision with some of President
Jordan's positions In his recent Sunday
evening address on "'Education" seems in
evitable. ' I have a profound respect
for Dr. Jordan's breadth, depth and judg
ment as a thinker upon the ethical side
of social questions, and therefore I ven
ture to hope that Jordan upon Spencer
has been misreported In such expression's
as the followins: "Education means ev
â¢erythlng." "A sound body means a sound
life." "There is no such thing as vice,
for vice is but the effort to get happiness
without earning it." These short state
ments, which have the uncanny appear
ance of half-truths, are culled from The
Call's report of President Jordan's lec
ture, not for the purpose of evoking
odium theologlcum, nor with any un
friendly Intent whatsoever, but becau?-*
they seem capable of being so Interpreted
as to give to the lecture an antl-religlotn
complexion and thus to falsify Dr. Jor
dan's commonly understood attitude
toward religion. Herbert Spencer pur
posely omitted direct consideration of thÂ«
clement of religion from his chapter on
"Moral Education," but he Included In It
the following sentences, which have a
very suggestive bearing upon the relate
tasks of education and religion for the
uplifting of mankind: ""We are not." say3
Gpencer, ! "among those who believe In
Lord Palmerston's dosma that all chil
dren are born good. On the whole, the
opposite dogma, untenable aa it is, seem*
to us less wide of the truth. Nor do we
agree with those -who think that, bv skill
ful discipline, children may be made al
together what they should be. Contrari
wise, we are satisfied that though Imper
fections of nature may be diminished by
wise management, tbev cannot be re
moved by it. The notion that an ideal hu
manity might be forthwith produced bv
a perfect system of education 13 ne:i
akin to that shadowed forth In the poems
of Shelley, that would mankind give up
their old Institutions, prejudices and er
rors, all the evils in the world would at
once disappear; neither notion being ac
ceptable to such as have dispassionately
studied human affairs." '
These are wise words and they Imply
that education is not "every t-lng"; that
there is such a thing: as vice, and that
there is in human nature a root of bitter
ness which physiological culture is not
likely to eradicate. For want of knowing
better, therefore, I must perforce adhero
to the old idea that there is in man evil
â¢which education alone, however broad,
many sided and thorough, canr.ot re
move, and that sin In the form of
moral perversity is so far Innate In hu
man nature that nothing short of thÂ»
spiritual forces of religion can reach it
with an effective cure. The grand, ever*
expanding and ever-varying work of edu
cation belongs to the incidents, conditions
and environment of human life, while tho
task of religion is with the moral spring
of conduct, the spiritual pulsations of our
being. Neither can do without the other:
therefore, let not the teacher despise the
spiritual physician.
Y[^> recent years h!s Satanic majesty ha?
| always been associated !n my mini
*i with a worthy Presbyterian elder ol
iny acquaintance â a Ftern old man oi
Scottish descent r.r.d extreme Calvinlstic
proclivities. This peculiar association o!
ideas began as follows: i:ider McCloud,
a California rancher and the father-in
law of several others, was one day hold
> Jnjf forth volubly upon hip pet doctrine of
f total depravity In the presence of one of
his sms-In-law, who was the father ol
ten children. "AH chllren," paid the ol<l
man. "are born Into the world children of
the dlwle." "What!" exclaimed the son-
In-law. "do you mean to say that the
devil is the father of my ten?" "Every
wan of them, my lad," answered the old
rrandfather promptly. "No. sir." was the
ycunrer one'ti prompt retort. "You may
eny that they are the devll> grandchil
dren If you like, but I'd have you know
that I'm their father." Tableau! And the
old man had the good sense to Join heart
ily In the laugh that followed at his ow 1
expense.
Elder McCloud believed what h<Â» said.
But, Imagine, If !t were true, what new
meaning we should have to read Into
Christ's phrase, "the deiil and his an-
Rele." Imagine, further, the topsy-turvy
Interpretation we should have to Rive to
Christ's benediction upon children and to
his immortal word?. "Suffer little children

fay "the kingdom of hell" instead?
The personality of the devil is to many
jvoopie a question of r^al and present in
â¢ terest. To Luther Satan was a lively per
sonality, if that story of the ink-pot be
ar.ythlr.gr more than a fablÂ», and that
Unry has its counterpart In thousands if

of the Idea that there In iÂ«uch a being, in

his Ti-Kiks and talks and desperate doins-s
in the Book of Job. and his Waterloo in
the G epel of Matthev.-. all belong to the
old theology; which appealed to the imasr-
Inatii r: and ca.l!ed art to Its aid. More
aver, nliJ-r people now living all recall
<-h*;.i!=h memories of horror and dread
associated with bogle stories and pictures
cf a villainous figure with horns, hocfa
and a tail. To unthink all that, so to
r;o.k. or to regard it all as allegory it
r . rire a strain upon the faith of lots
Vt very religious people. Further.* the
idea of a personal devil is a great and per
y^tual convenience â like a cat around a
kitchen where some delicacy has disap
jrared, or a dish has been broken â a sort
cf universal scape-goat. Adam blamed
the woman, and Eve blamed the serpent.
Most of us deem Adam an unchivalrous
coward, but we ourselves have a snoak
1rg satisfaction In denouncing the ser
per.t; it feels so good to have some one
el^r- to blame for the wrong things that
p.rf being said and done in the world from
day to day, as well as those that have
been perpetrated in the past long history
of the world at large. Besides, to aban
don the doctrine of a personal devil Is to
be thrown upon the disagreeable alterna
tive of "Every man his own devil." whirh
Is a. distinctly less flattering sentiment
than "Every man his own God." There
fore, whatever may be said for or against
the doctrine, of a mighty and subtle spirit
ual personality as the embodiment and
propagator of evil that doctrine is apt to
be largely believed for a long time tv>
ecme. both because Bible statements seem
to favor It and because many sorts of peo
ple would rather construe those state
nvnts literally than figuratively.
But the question of the devil's person
ality is. after all. only Incidental to that
vastly larger subjectâ the existence of
evil in the world In the forms of pin and
its conserjucnccs. The good oia Methodist
lady vrho, according: to the story, was
taken to taÂ«k by her pastor for praying
fojr tin? conversion of "that pesky old
BÂ«.-"-lzobub" was less radical In her ideas
than she njppofed. Of course, her notion
was that an answer to her prayer would
piii s.n end jo sin at its very source, and
great was her surprise at being rebuked
for an ambition so laudable. But the phil
osophical limitations cf her pastor's faith
fortadc such flights of presumptuous dar-
In;j. And both the church and the world
ere to-t!ay on the pastor's side. We get it
the unknown through the known, and our
Firusrgle with evil Is Inspired by the grim
realization that the devil must be fought
end conquered In the person* of his hu
man rcpresentatix-es. Sin incarnated In
the perMonal conduct and character of
r-uiran lives Is what the world has to
meet and grapple with in Its efforts to- ',
ward progress, whether individual or unl- ,
versaL
t And what Is irin? The question looks ,

Â¥t- ' v Ricult. According to an old theo- i
I %' ...f definition Fin Is any violation of or i
vuist of conformity with the law of God. ,
''An older definition still is that of the !
Apostle John In the New Testamentâ (
tersely expressed In the revised version <
in three wordsâ "Sin Is lawlessness." The j
difficulty about such definitions is that 1
thry are philosophically inco:np.ete, while <
excellence consists In the fact that J
they provide n erood starting point for that
kind of investigation which Is Impelled
by prnotlcal Intent. If we would construe
tlie term Pin with I'teral exactness It may

then a vast proportion of the evil remain-

perfect knowledge of these matters moral
perversity would entirely disappear is a
question that cannot be answered In the
affirmative. While some forms of sin
seem to diminish others certainly seem to
increase with the spread of knowledge
and the improvement of the physical con

knowledge being for the most part a
piecemeal and lopsided affair, with moral

attention while the man could talk to
"Leg-long." This fellow had a whole
bunch of military clothes and things, but
There was a tea-party In progress, and
suddenly a soldier with a corking uniform
and big hat rushed In and began to talk.'
I think "Leg-long" had been giving him
hot air, maybe, and got him a little off,
for he began to yell "Vive!" and try to
salute. Every time he did It they called
him down, and finally threw him out. It
showed that she had been getting the sol
diers to take her part, and her guardians
didn't want to encourage any business of
that kind, because the French* were excit
able and it might lead to trouble. They
knew that "Leg-long" never could make
good as a general if trouble Btarted. They
were willing to humor her, but they
wouldn't stand any hip-hurrah business
from the soldiery. v
Then a lady read some poetry to quiet
things down. And then Bay-ran herself
came in. 1 spotted her in a second -and
clapped just as soon as any one.; She was
dressed all in black and looked very: sad
and dispirited, as if she had had . a bad
night I could see at a glance it was a
case of wheels and consumption. Â¦ The
people around humored her. just as much
us they could and saluted as if she were
a man and a great officer. One old fellow
even showed her a sample case of badges
from which she . could make . a selection,
but she wasn't much interested.'
Act 1 is rather quiet, but it serves its
purpose of putting you onto tha plot. It
is a close-in-veranda scene, with a * long
boo-le-vard running right straight back
out of sight In tha distance. Just like one
of those long country lanes with trees on
both sides and road kept well watered.

psamble better. The fourth act is the
crazy scene. It is great! \
They had a whole bunch of Punch-and-
Judy show soldiers that they put on the
table, and the soldier-man showed "Les
ions" a few. tricks about war. "Leg-long"
waxed very patriotic and landed some
heavy ones on the audience amid much
applause. She ; carries the sympathy
Inrnugh the piece right' along.
After; a while an old boy with a black
tie and light pants and a long black coat
came in. < He might have been ; a bank
president or an undertaker, or a commis
sioner for, the insane. He was. evidently
a. friend of Â¦ the family, for he talked
straight from the shoulder to the , young
lady. She swung back with some hot shot,
but he got : rather th<*" best of it in, his
closing argument. ; Just- as he, finished
with some remarks about the French na
tion being" fat-ee-gay, or something :; to
that effect: that thev were tired of tha
Napoleon craze anyway, Ko-kee-lan came
in and heard him.
Well, when Ko-kee got started he
put it all over the somber gent in> black.
Ko-kee in the play is Flambow. or tho
I spotted him at once as a man with a
?urposa and in disguise. Ha was one of
hosa soldiers who were in favor of start-
Ing a row and using "Leg-long," on ac
count of her fatner's reputation, as
dummy to make general trouble. He and
"Leg-long" got chummy right away and
commenced hatching up schemes, but
were interrupted by the arrival , of two
of her , guardians : so the man and tha
woman had to hide behind a screen while
"Leg-long" kept tha new arrivals busy.
Finally tha curtain went down with "Leg
long" and the saleslady having a nice Ut
tla heart-to-heart talk by the table under
lae red Hsht.
The next act had some rather exciting
stuff It in. It opened up quiet. enough in
a comfortable library with an old ruin on
a hill visible through the window. Some
soldiers took turns running in and out, and
then came "Leg-long" in a hot military
suit, all In white, with high gum boots
nicely polished and a couple of furniture
tassels hanging from her belt and two
etars on her chest. Just like the "Native
Sons wear on' parade day. '
'i. ue same guy who tried . to sell the
clothes was fhere, 'Â¦ this . time . in full uni
form, and I was glad to see that my guess
that he was a soldier had come true.
You wouldn't think: to look at her that
she had so much spunk. It is the old Na-

act. and it is great The uncle gets "Leg

tience, and has made up his mind to try
a strong. cure. He makes her look # in ths

the pitiable figure. Bhe cuts attired as a
man. He tells; her she raierht just as
well stop being crazy and settle down to

talk and gets the poor girl so , excitedâ
for by this time she is groaning aloudâ
that all of a 'sudden she grabs the candle
stick from h!s ; hand and smashes tha
heavy plate glass mirror all to pieces.
In the third act the uncle came in to
expostulate â it was the same stasre set
tingâand to try to get "Leg-long" to quiet
down. But he bumped right Into Flambow
keeping guard at the young lady's door
and ail dressed up as one of the old
guard of Napoleon, with an immensi
arum-major hat and a gun with & bayonet
on it. I guess "Leg-long" made him put
on the rig to carry out the idea that sha
was a second Napoleon. Flam kept the
old gent at bay with the bayonet all
right. But finally a band of music struck
up outside, and in came "Legr-long." Flam

there were two shots fired: but he evl

He is not exactly true to his trust, be

threw It Into the black boy so hard that
tha gent beat a precipitate retreat. Then
Ko-kee pulled out of his pockets a whola
lot of stuff â plates and handkerchiefs and
things with mottoes of France and tha
great Napoleon on themâ and "Leg-long"
commenced to think that she was the real
thing again. There was a band playing
encouraging tunes outside. It was a sad
case, but you couldn't help feeling pleas
ure in the enjoyment the poor young
thing got out of this momentary patriotic
burst.
In act five you could see that she had
gone from bad to worse. I think that in
the interim she must have been hitting
the Green Terrorâ you know that fright
ful French drink they call absinthe. The
scene was the plain of Wacram. I got
that from the picture outside the theater
It is nothing but a flock of sand dunes
with a shanty on the left, but- "Leg-long"
has evidently escaped and rushed out here
thinking it is a battlefield. Flambow has
followed her and when tha scene opens is
begging her to come home to her peoDle
for it will be all off with him as her par
ticular watchman if he does not get her
back before dawn. Some other retainers
rush in and do the best they can but no
Bhe will not leave. Finally a lot of police
men come in in official capacity to arrest
Flambow for not attending to his dutv
more carefully. I spotted them as officers
at once on account of their high hats ami
bullseye lanterns. A lot of people around
me made Irrelevant remarks.
"Leg-long" made it a personal matter
to thank the man who took her side, but
still she felt?rather down In the mouth
at the general sentiment.
They are there to see what tha people
think about "Leg-long" as a future gen
eral anyway. The staga has all been as
dark as grandma's pocket so far, but now
they bring In the lights and all tha mum
mers coma In to tha excellent feed which
is spread. "Leg-long" soon finds out what
they think about her, for a good many
unpleasant speeches commence to float
around and Flambow pours a glass of
booze Into his gun to put the cartridge on
the bad lest he should become so excited
that he might attempt to flre into the
crowd.
One man takes "Leg-long's" part and
talks back to another fellow. 1 was in

don't expect it you hear Flam calling

he was in the last act. I guess she made

plays the chief partâ "Leg-long." Judg
ing from the name she fails to make the
part quite historically correct. She really
i3 rather short-leggftd. But she can act
all right, so you don't notice it much.
The whole plot in a nutshell is that
"Leg-long" is the daughter, of the great
Napoleon, and she feela so bad that she
wasn't a boy that she goes a bit daffy
over It and insists upon wearing boy's
clothes and soldier's uniforms, and swell
ing It aroi.nd to try and be recognized as
a second Napoleon general. She wants to
be another Joan of Arc, as it were, but,
hasn't the physique. It is really a sad
case.
1 don't understand much French, bat
the acting is so clever that with a few
words here Â£nd there you know Just what
is going on. On the level I had to weep
once or twice. â¢ "Leg-long" Is an awfully
dear girl, you can see that through ths
lines, and it seems too bad that she has
to be spoiled by having bad such a great
father. Some of her relative* are a little
cruel with her, but most of them bear
with her in her mental affliction.
You see whenever, these shows in a for
eign tongue come to town they are care
less about printing directions qn the pro
gramme* that they give away because
they have books to sell between acts with
the whole business explained In English.
The free programmes have merely the
names of the fictitious characters with
the name of the actor opposite, but don't
give the relationship that these charac
ters bear to "Leg-long." I don't believe
in buying books at a show. It is too
much like patronizing the side shows at
a three-ring circus. As I do not know
any of the actors it was a
little hard for me to connect them with
the parts they played, especially as there
was a gooa deal of disguising done by dif
ferent ones as the play went on. Still

it left him too cramped in means to
properly feed and clothe himself, and
that he had sometimes been forced to
sacrifice his summer vacation in his
efforts to retain friendship. Had I
belonged to that young man's circl-j
of friends I would have endeavored to
put an end to that state of; affairs by
urging him to .make a firm stand
against such a tax.
' It seems that nearly every. woman
whose good .will he jdesired /to. keep
had some.pet charity or, plan to which
she devotad her time in Lent, whil<3
her friends were expected to supply
the capital. I .strongly suspect that
these projects were like some I can
remember' in which self -represented
the charity. However, with pencil and
paper, the names of friendsâmascu
line, generally â were gathered up,
and to each was sent a prettily word
ed note with two ssats for a lecture
or concert, two tickets for some enter
tainment, and a postscript stating
that the subscription would be re
garded as a personal favor. What
man could , withstand thatP What
were clothing and food and rest com
pared, with the good favor of tho
writsrP- This was the method adopted
by. a 'woman who embarked upon a
publishing enterprise and openly de
clared;th'at she expected every one of
her friends to take a year's subscrip
tion to her periodical. She had not the
slightest regard for the I person's
taste in the matter; she wanted the
money, that was all.
1 have always thought that It
would be a good thing for some of
these women to hear the remarks of
their victims. Â¦ I think their self
esteem would suffer so severely that,
for a time at least, their charity
would take some other form. We are

tell them of our little plans and ac
cept their aid if it is freely offered,
and you may be sure it will be, if
circumstances permit. A deal better
would it be for every woman to use
her own pocket money for her char
ity, making it. go as far as it will,
and making up f or its smallness by a
bit of sewing or some other good deed.
In the mad rush which we call life
Lent.is the breathing spell which
fashion allows its devotees. Â«It is the
time to repair health and good looks,
and prepare for a fresh campaign at
the summer' resorts. The mother of
a family of small children usually
utilizes Lent for the making of sum
mer wardrobes for the family, super
intending the seamstresses and dress
makers who are engaged, sometimes,
a. whole year ahead. This is a sensi
ble plan which leaves ths warm days
enjoyed in a leisurely fashion. One
girl of my acquaintance forswears
all evening engagements, and devotes
the time after 9 o'clock to sleep and
beauty repair. At the close of Lent
she blossoms out like the flowers in
the gardens and on her pretty Easter
hats, and all without a particle of
medicine aside from nature's restorer
â sleep.
Whatever the motive which actu
ates the use of Lsnt as a time of rest,
every woman ought to make the most
of it. "But rest means change" is the
usual feminine excuse, as women
plunge into new but equally exhaust
ing diversions. Yes, that is one kind
of rest, but not the best kind for ac
tive people who have denied them
selves rest for twelve months. A
whole month of absolute rest means
years of usefulness later on, remem
ber that. We may not all live to a
green old ag-e, but we certainly
ought to provide for such a contin
gency in a half-way decent manner,
at least. A green old age is infinitely
preferable to a dry-as-dust, helpless
one, which is the lot of some men and
women.

WHATEVER, our creed, I
think tlie majority of us look
forward to the lenten season
with some sort of reverence; some
sort of feeling that for a brief little
time out of the busy year we "will be
good, either to ourselves or to some
body else.
It seems as if I can look batfck to a
very f ew years ago "when only Catho
lics and Episcopalians paid any at
tention to Lent. Indeed, many pro
fessed Christians had not the faintest
idea of its beginning 1 and end, beyond
the fact that it marked the bridge be
tween bleak winter and balmy spring,
jboo.6. meant the*' shedding of old gar
ments and the donning of new
plumage, and that masculine bug
bear, the . season of housecleaning.
I wish that we might be left to
work out our own salvation in the
manner which best suits us, but
knowing that some of us need spurs
in the shape of invitations to sub
scribe to one thing or another, I try
to be reconciled to the daily begging
letters of enthusiastic workers in the
cause of charity. Perhaps they* are
the penance we need, or part of it, at
all events. It is on this very subject
I am going to sound a note of warn
ing.
As a beginning, I will state em
phatically that I believe in lenten
charity. I believe in charity at ail
seasons. I do not believe that many
of us -will sigh too heavily over the
vanishing dollars when we reflect
that they are going to gladden the
hearts of the needy. We do complain,
too loudly and bitterly, perhaps, to
be in strict accordance with a Chris
tian spirit, against being cajoled into
subscribing to private enterprises.
No friend has a right to put us to
such a test. I once heard a young
man, who enjoyed a, large degree of
popularity, complain that the lenten
season was a greater strain upon his
pocketbook than the holidays, that
SPINAL CORDâ The spinal
cord is the tail projection of the
brain, which runs through the sfrin
. al column. It is made up of the
mass of nerve fibers which run
from the brain to all parts of the
body, from the neck dozen. It is
along this path that the impulses
. travel from the brain to the limbs
Jo produce motion, and to the in
ternal and external organs to pro
mote their functions. It is also
through this path that the sensa
tions of the ski'71 and internal or
gans are transmitted to the brain.
Disease or injury of the spinal cord
is therefore liable to cause paralysis
of the organs and limbs situated be
low the level of the seat of injury
or disease.
When the brain ceases function
ing all functions of the body cease
and the individual dies. The part
of the brain which ceases function
ing last is the medulla oblongata,
which keeps up the action of the
heart long after the mind has died.
In fact, the mind dies as the mori
bund loses consciousness, but the
medulla oblongata continues to send
nerve impulses to the heart and
lungs yet sometimes for hours, and
thus keeps up the last sparks of life
during this time that zee call
"agony."*.
ZIFE is the sum total of the
general functions of the
body. It can be perfect
and enjoyable only xvhen
all the organs are properly and har
moniously working, for the func
tion of each organ is an intrinsic
part of life. As soon as one fails
life is incomplete, and the failure is
voiced or made apparent by symp
toms of impaired health.
These organic functions or vital
processes being the actual meclian
ism of life, it is indispensable that
the people should have an insight
into the principal ones, so as to real
ize their importance.
. THE BRAINâ The brain is the
organ which generates the tierve
force and nerve impulses with
which it activates and controls all
the organs of the body. The front
al region of the brain, known as
the intellect, where the mind re
sides, is the seat of all impressions
and the center of all sensations;
when its function is temporarily
abolished by a narcotic or anesthetic
sensations are no longer perceived,

The importance of the heart's
function is shown by the fact that
as soon as the nerves of this organ
are touched by a great emotion
which causes it to cease beating for
an instant the individual faints,
and if the shock is so powerful as
to prolong its arrest life ceases.

and as it beats propels it into the
arteries, and from there through all
the tissues of the body. The heart
beat is a sudden contraction of its
muscles produced by* nervous im
pulses received from the brain.
THE HEARTâ This organ
has tivo distinct, non-communica
tive compartments â the "right and
the left. Its right side aspires and
receives from the large veins the
The " perspiration of the skin,
which is a constant function, is so
important that in the event of .ex
tensive burns or scalds, with large
areas of skin destroyed, death re
sults from the loss of this function.
These various functions should
convince the reader of the necessity
of keeping the skin healthy by bath
ing and friction. When the skin
is bruised, diseased or injured it is
no longer invulnerable to disease
germs, and the part should be pro
tected with an antiseptic dressing to
avoid blood poisoning. For this
purpose, ivhen nothing else is at
hand, vaseline or lard may be used.
THE SKINâ The skin is an
organ the functions of which
are various and highly im
portant. (1) By its sweat glands
and pores it throws out, like
the kidneys, the excess of fluid and
impurities pt^sent in. the blood.
This function is essential to life,
and still more so when th'e kidneys
are oz'crtaxed or diseased. (2) It
is also through its meat glands
that the skin throzvs off the excess
of body heat, thus acting as a safe
ty valve, without which we could
not live in summer. (3) Unless
bruised, diseased or injured in any
way, the skin is germ proof, and
as such stands as a barrier to dis
ease germs, thereby protecting the
body from disease.
The nerves are like machinery
without the steam; they are capable
of great energy; they have a natu
ral power which is apt to be almost
indefinitely increased by training,
but the blood is the steam behind
that machinery.
THE NERVESâ Nerves are
the off shoots of the brain and spinal
cord, and consist of motor and sens
ory fibers. Through their victor
fibers the brain sends out impulses
to the limbs and all organs, and
thereby actuates all the functions of
the body. Through the sensory
fibers all sensations received travel
up to the brain, the center of percep
tion. When a nerve ceases func
tioning through injury or disease,
or its central origin in the brain or
spinal cord is injured or diseased,
the organ or limb to which it is dis
tributed also becomes functionless,
i. e., paralysed.
occur in Bright' s disease. It is,
however, only through tlie blood
pressure maintained by the force of,
the heart that the kidneys can per*
form their function.
THE PANCREASâ This or
gan is situated behind the stomach
pouch. It secretes the pancreatic
juice, which is* indispensable for
the digestion.
THE SPLEENâ The function
of this organ is not positively
known.
THE RED MARROWâ This
variety of marroiv exists only in
certain bones, especially the flat
bones, and it is known to manufac
ture the red blood corpuscles, that
is, the main constituent of the blood.
THE MUSCLESâ The mus
cles are our organs of locotnotiotu
They are attached to the bones by
both their ends, and are under the
strict control of the nervous system*
Upon receiving impulses from the
latter they contract and draw to
ward their ozvn side of the bones
which they are attached, thereby
producing motion. They also serve
to brace the bones in any attitude
which the individual may assume*
The muscles develop only under,
the impulsion and at the same ratio
as the motor nerves by which they
are controlled.
REMARKSâ All the functions
of the body are interdependent;
when one goes wrong others go
wrong, too. Good health is wholly
dependent upon the normal, undis
turbed functions of our organs, and
we should bear in mind the fact
that all of these functions are at the
mercy of our sensations; thai they
are disturbed, slowed or perverted
by every ill feeling, either moral or
physical, and stimulated by every
good feeling. Cheerfulness is tlie
most natural stimulant for our
functions and the best tonic for our.
health. Among the depressive sen
sations we find: The effect pro*
duccd by dramatic plays or novels,
ire, anxiety, worry, grief, jealousy,
THE KIDNEYSâ The kidneys
are the most important channels of
elimination of the fluids, impurities
of the blood and waste products of
the body. When these organs are
diseased the fluids accumulate in
the body, and zee have the condition
known as "drops 4 }')' while the im
purities and zvaste products which
are not completely eliminated cre
ate the various disturbances which
fear, fright, gloomy imagination,
disappointments, keen hope, pro
found or all-absorbing love, and
physically, pains, aches and the fa*
tigue resulting from a too assiditr*
ous brain zvork or eye strain.
Anybody may be able to observe
repeatedly that the degree of appe*
tite is proportionate to the freedom
of the mind from disturbance and
fatigue, other things being equal

tents into the upper bowel the gall
bladder also pours its bile therein,

duces about .one-half of the body
heat by its rapid circulation, pres
sure and friction in the arteries.
(The other half of the body heat is
produced by the burning up of the
oxygen by the tissues.)
THE LIVERâ The functions
of the liver^ are the following:
1 â It secretes the bile, which aids
in the digestion of the^fats, oils and
butter, and which furthermore, by
its antiseptic properties, prevents
early fermentation and decomposi
tion of the food in the boivels, thus
allowing digestion and assimilation
to be completed uninterruptedly.
When the stools of the adult are ab
normally offensive and yellowish
instead of brozvn, if is an indication
that the liver is torpid, that is, in
sufficiently active.
2 â Certain products of diges
tion, such as the albumens and
sugars, pass through the substance
of the" liver before reaching the
blood - stream. Therein they are
further chemically transformed,
and the sugars are stored up and
given off to the tissues as fuel in
proportion as needed.
2 â The liver purifies the blood
by destroying the poisons absorbed
from the bowels or produced by dis
ease. When this important organ
is torpid or diseased these poisons
reach the brain and spinal cord and
give rise to fever, headache and
backache.

THE BLOODâ The functions
of the blood are chiefly four, name
ly: (i) It carries and distributes to
all parts of the body the nourish
ment absorbed from the stomach
a)id intestines, with which all tis
sues are kept in constant repair or
rebuilt. (2) It carries and distri

TABLE HABITS IN TURKISH HOMES
BICYCLES ARE THE FAD IN SIAM.
Â«=j=Hi: King cf Siam rides an American
bicycle of the latest and most.ap
11 proved model. The wheel is a great
success there, though the first safety
bicycle was taken to Bangkok only five
years ago by an American dentist named
Carrinston. He rrade a great sensation
en his trips around the city. The natives
thought it a wonderful Invention, and
many who had the money to invest im
ports whet-Is a.r.d learned the art of rid

birycles in Kangkok alone, and all classes

The popularity of the wheel In Siam is
rrmarkab!<? eonridering the average poor
ness of the roads, though they are very
good in Bangkok. In fact, many public
tacn advocate tht wheel as a means of
stimulating the demand for better high
ways In town and country. When the
Minister of the Interior became the presi
dent of a bicycle club that numbers over
400 members he said the wheel was an in
fluence in behalf of better roads, and he
was heartily In favor of it both for this
reason and because of the enjoyable exer
cise it afforded. Many of the Princes of
Eiam belong to this club, and in the cooler
seasons of the year the club has long runs
to the remote parts of the city. Slam at
all seasons is a hot country, and the bi
cycle runs are usually held In the cool of
the night and often extend, on one street
and another, a distance of thirty or forty
miles. At that time there is no traffic and
the enthusiastic wheelmen have the thor
oughfares to themselves. The runs usu
ally wind up with a- banquet well along
toward morning. The city is well adapted
to the use of bicycles, for the streets are
level and fairly well paved in all direc
tions. Any pleasant afternoon when the
King or Queen take their favorite drive to
the new palace at Dusit Park several

A few months ago the fashionable

Hamilton King, our Consul â¢ General at
Bangkok, has sent home these remarks
made by one of the local newspapers:
"Taken simply as a parade of cyclists

they could have been expected to be

The" bicycle has gone to Siam to stay. It
is finding Its way Into the outlying cities
and 'villages, and, is bringing better means
of communication. In the wet season, of
course, there can be little enthusiasm, but
when the skies are bright the wheel Is al
ways in the public eye. The American
wheel is the favorite, and the fact that

came from this country shows that the
people know where they may procure the

as a city of restaurants and bachelors.

main Idea seems to be to keep the res

It Is & great rendezvous for the oleS
timersâ old Huntlogton and Fair often
ate here. Some of the tables used In '49

which come free with a 23-cent meal.
"When ha has about finished his cracked,
crab and any loose crackers or bread ho
can find, he rushes out after a friend he
has seen passing and rushes up against
another free crab. He says "A few free
crabs and some shrimps will fill a fellow
to more advantage than swallowing noth

Another boasts of getting a 73-cent meal
for 10 cents and treating his friend. His
friend takes a cup of coffee and gets a
10-cent check. The stew bum takes both
checks while his friend mixes with the
crowd and goes out of the door. Tha '

Till llfÂ« fle<J from us like an Idle dream;
A show of mummeiy without a meaning.
To begin with the weatherâ the night
was close and drizzling:, and al
though my gown was anything but
warm, I had to throw back my wrap
. for the enforced exercise resultant
from being pounded over cobblestones
In a rubberless wheeled vacuum was too
much, and I stepped out feeling certain
that my backbone was clicking through
the top of my head.
I handed In my card, grabbed my char
acter and with chattering teeth made for
the" dressing-room.
There I applied the simplest rules of
Christian Science to myself.
X couldn't get within yards of the mlr-

charming," and with childlike , faith in
this last "phase of my meditation, walked
out on the balcony, and leaning over,
looked down.
There it was! The Black Frost! The
blight of the San Francisco Mardi Gras!
It was all over in hideou? conventional
dress suit, looking foolish and apologetic,
for as some of it said to me later, "You
can't expect a man to be funny in his
own face."
I had been warned of it, but having seen
Mardi Gras in other cities I stoutly re
fused to believe it.
But thore it was.
I shivered and looked about me.
What better setting could one wish? A
house which seemed built for a carnival,
and decorations which rivaled anything
I had seen before. . ;""â¢.' ;^
Then an. idea came to me â Its very bril
liancy cast a warm glow over my fast
freezing senses.
I remembered reading when quite young
a story (In words of one syllable) about a
poor little chap who was almost frozen to
death. -This highly instructive tale went
on to say that when he was entirely sur
rounded by snow he became quite warm.
Now. I thought, perhaps if is the same
with .the Black Frost, so I. trotted down
stairs and selecting the most meltlng
lcoking riiecimen I said, "Why are the
men not in costume or masked?"
His looks Â«ald, "You must be from Mis

from New York."

"Jove, the directors ruled It out, you
knowâ riot Folly but masking, you know."
The dance was no better and I was
slowly congealing. I wandered "in and
out and round about" like a Dutch dolJ,
ever hoping that I might tlnd the thin?
which I felt sure must be in hiding and
would make its appearance later.
"For what are you looking?" said the
Black Frost.
"For the Spirit of the Carnival." I said.
"Well, you have, struck the wrong '-.ace;
you want to go down in % the Latin quar
ter for that. This is an up-to-date so
ciety burlesque."
So I was . not to find the" Spirit of tha
Carnival here.

she blurted out.
"By your' teeth. I'd know them In
China."
"I didn't know I was labeled like a box
of caramels," she said.
It was almost 1 o'clock and the f\sns\
for unmasking was given. Flower girls,
Japanese and Chinese ladles, Carmens.

girls floc'ked upstairs to remove their
masks.

ThÂ« engineer was a little doubtful about

down to eee with his very own eyes that
he was to be sidetracked for the time be-
at the first station of the Seventh street

Two ladles who had Just left the salt

United States who would^ have been will

But when the unhappy lady went to
Brussels to get possession of her fortune
she- was dismayed to learn that her
royal brother, who was then King, had
spent it all in the Congo Free State in
West Africa. He brutally refused to
make the loss* good or to aid her In any
way.
It was during this stermy Interview
with King Leopold that Carlotta first lost
her reason. But she was not entirely In
competent till after she had tried In vain
to get help from other sources.
From Brussels she went to Paris, where,
after, many heartbreaking delays, she
gained/an Interview with, Napoleon III.
She entreated him to at least Keep the
promise which be had made to Maximilian
to keep eight thousand French soldiers In
Mexico for six years. But the French
Emperor could neither send more troops
to Mexico, nor even refrain from with
drawing the" French soldiers which were
already there. \ N
The civil war being over In the United
States this country had time to enforce
?.he Monroe doctrine, and Lieutenant Gen
eral John M. Schofleld, U. 8. A., x was
sent to the French court "To get his legs
under Napoleon's mahogany and tell him
he must get out of Mexico." .,
.This was a mission of delicacy and ore
which required tact. Although the peopiÂ«
of France were not in favor of the inter
vention in Mexican affairs, their national
pride would not permit the Emperer to
yield to menace even from the United
States, or ailow ." French troops to be
driven from Mexico without an effort i>
ir.air.Uan them therÂ«s. "A public threat by
the American people would have precipi
tated a war betweea this country and
Franc*. But 'General Schofield was, able
to fuinil his mission without the loss of
the friendship of our former alliesâ tna
people cf France. .
Napolecn withdrew his troops and tha
death of. Maximilian ended the Imperial
Government In Mexico.
But this defeat In Mexico showed that
Nr.poleon III did not possess t!v? foresight
with which he was credited: that he was
not the great man he, had been supposed
to be: that he could err In Judgment. Jf
he had not been engaged in Mexico and in
imminent danger fit becoming involved *n
difficulties with the United States. Prince
Bismarck would probably not have struck
the decisive blow In 1S70.
After Napoleon turned a deaf ear tn
Carlotta's appeal she went to the Pope.
His power la spiritual, not temporal, and
he was unable to help her. The dark
frenzy of the maniac then cam* upon her
never to be dissipated. Her younge
brother, the Duke of Klanders. took her
back to her old home at Mlramar. near
Trieste, on the Adriatic. In thia beautiful
castle Maximilian and Carlotta had tho
blissful years of their married life until
the arrival of the -deputation from the
Mexican Assembly of Notables, who came
to offer Maximilian the throne and title
of Eirpercr of Mexico,
In. this 'quiet retreat Carlotta began to
recover, and Leopold, knowing that dis
grace would ; Inevitably follow if she
recovered, sent his wife to Miramar
to fetch Carlotta to Belgium, where IÂ»e
might see her occasionally and aggravate
tha malady. The s sight of her brother
threw her into the msst violent condition.
The Queen took Carlotta to the palaca
of Servr.erpn in Belgium, where shÂ« has

to man the lifeboats one Chinese, who
acts as overseer for the others, must re
ceive Instructions and then transmit them
to the others. This means delay and con
fusion, and would be altogether avoided
if white crews were employed.

If white men Instead of Chinese were
employed they could be relied upon also
to remain at their posts in emergencies
where life Is at stake. It Is significant
that of the thirty white officers of the
Rio de Janeiro nineteen met death at their
posts, while a majority of the Chinese es
caped from the ship. This simply means
that the Chinese looked after themselves
alone, and the white men remained to
render what aid they could.
Thousands made their way to the ocean
beach, to the heights above the , Cliff
House and to the northern wharves yes
terday to wait and watch for some sign
of the wreck. But nothing could be seen.
Now and again the heavy fog would* rise
and reveal scores of tiny craft plowing
about the ecene of the disaster, picking
up bits of shattered lumber and any arti
cle which might float to the surface. The
Police Department cent out two detec
tives to patrol the scene and to demand
of every boatman his business and an ac
count of his property. The Federal
authorities also had men upon the beach
to watch for thieves, but none were found.
One-half of the lifeboat in which Mrs.
Wlldman and others met their death was
washed up on the Marin County shore.
During the afternoon a sad memento of
the disaster was carried by the waves
tg the beach at* Harbor View. It was
a photograph of Consul General Wildman
and one of his children, the baby clasping
its father's neck. Some of Captain Ward's
papers were also found, and among them
was his license as a master. But the
waves did not give back the dead, who re
main Etill coffined in the sunken ship.

These applicants were very much relieved

MOURNS FOR
SAILOR LOVER
Miss Ltna . Jackson, Captain Ward's
Betrotlffed, Weeps Over Fate of
the (Wrecked Rio's".
... Master.
The kind attentions . r and soothing
caresses of loving friends , and sympa
thetic relatives have proven unavailing to
soften the grief of Miss -Lena Jackson,
who was betrothed to Gaptain ' Ward of
the Rio de Janeiro. Prostrated by grief
and almost on the verge of hysteria, she
lies in a darkened room at he'r home at
2113 Howard street,* constantly, bewailing
the sad fate of, her lover, .by [whom sho
hoped to be soon led -to the altar. No
one had awaited the home-coming, of the
Rio with more impatience than she. Kach
day during the latter part of the, voyage
when it was thought that the ship was
nearing this port she scanned-, the papers!
hoping to catch some intelligence of the
vesrel that carried her loved one.
Captain Â¦ Ward " and Miss Jackson had
been engaged for almost nine years. . She
first met the captain on board his own
ship, in which she returned from- a visit
to China In 1832. â¢ ;
When the tidings of the dreadful trag
edy reached her she persistently, refused
to believe them, and yesterday,"accompa
nied by her sister, she .wandered; about
the beach, hoping against hope for tidings
from the. lost one. Even last; night, when
almost every one believed the captain k to
be' among the missing, the; faithful one
still clung to the hope that he had escaped
and was still preserved for her.
ATTETRI> scene was enacted last
night on the ocean beach.
Huge bonfire* lit up the chore
and dispelled at Intervals the
black death curtain or fog
which hung over tho waters.
HerÂ© and there men moved
er.2 cued at the breakers as they roared
aafl broke upon tha beach, A night watch
tad been established to look for tha
bodies of the dead who had gcma down In
the steamship C3ty of Rio de JanÂ»ro. Tho
glocra. of thÂ« disaster which had happened
et the very entrance to the harbor and
which bad cost 123 human lives -was etll]
cpon the people of the city.
Every one, almost stunned by a catas
trophe which may happen again, as It did
before, was seeking to fix responsibility
for the terrible affair where It Justly be
,Â°. longi?. There is now practically no Ques
tion that Captain Frederick Jordan, the
pilot. Is responsible for the destruction of
the Rio de Janeiro. When he went upon
the bridge of the ship hU authority was
supreme. The lives of the crew and of
the paEsergs^s were la his hands, and
or.ly by his orders did the giant vessel
move on throuph the blackness of the
night to destruction.
K. P. Schwerin, general manager of the
Pacific Mall Steamship Company, Is try-
Ing to place the blame for the disaster
upon Captain "Ward, the master of the
Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Schwerin. Is taking
an advantage of a dead man. a "privilege
I he -is perhaps pleased to exercise, but his
crue! assault upon the master cf a ship
â¢who bravely died at his post will not re
move responsibility from Pilot Jordan.' A
pilot in every port In the civilized world
is supreme in command when he goes
up'-r. the bridge of a vessel.
TZL PIXOT HESPONKCBI.E.
Shipping: masters without exception de
clare that it would be the very height of
absurdity for conditions to be otherwise.
A p^Ict is called aboard because he Is
r.ceded. and in all emergencies his Judg
ment rules. It Is he who decides whether
. or rot a ship may enter a. harbor, and
eh.'rri^g- masters are dumfounded that
cr.y other opinion chould be maintained.
In every Instance masters gi-f- way to
pilots, an<3 not only custom but law In all
ports makes the rule universal.
This does not mean that a master of a
vessel surrenders his command to a pilot.
Tho master is supreme In everything ex
cept in thÂ»t particular in which he has
given up his cuthority. He has chosen a
erJi<5Â« an<J to that ruldo he submits In
.everything which relates to guidance. In
everything else In his conduct of tha
ship's affairs. In his authority over his
officers smd crew, he Is as he was before
he asked for a pilot.
When it Â«b claimed, therefore, that Cap
tain YTard instructed Pilot Jordan to en
ter the harbor In the fog It must be ad
mitted that Jordan. In obeying that In
struction, violated the most Important ob
ligation cf his position and must accept
A the responsibility, horrifying as It Is. of
his act. A double Investigation will be
made la reference to the disaster. The
Federal inspectors have no authority over
Pilot Jordan, but they can make an In
quiry which will leave no question as ta
his responsibility, and the State authori
ties may then act.
The Federal inspectors have already be
rsa their Inquiry, and their method indi
cates that the Investigation will be of
pome benefit. In times past the Pacific
Mall Steamship Company has tak*n care
to Interview the survivors of wrecks be
fore the officers of the law could see
them, and the result has been not Infre
quently advantageous to the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company. The Federal in
ppectors probably do not Intend that this
shall happen again, for yesterday they
had one Important witness, the surviving
oScer of the Rio de Janeiro, Graham
Coghlan. before them.
A DOUBLE XNTrESTTGATTON 1 .
To-morrow they will decide when the
regular inquiry will begin. It is expected
that much important testimony bearing
on the question of responsibility will 'be
Riven. When the Federal inspectors have
finished the State Pilot Commission
will bc^in its Investigation and
decide what to do with Pilot Jordan,
p^ This matter Is considered by the public at
larjre to be one of the most vitally Impor
tant v hich ever developed In the city.
That a ship carrying hundreds of human
lives should go down at the entrance to
the harbor is a tragic event which has ex
cited horror not only in San Francisco but
in the State and nation.
The following telegram will illustrate
Â¦what deep concern this disaster has occa

he was sweeping when the front door was
suddenly, opened and three women en
tered, one of them was armed with a re

outcry. He Bald that, despite the threat;
he began shouting for aid and the baf

an adjoining building. '. .
An investigation . made by the police
showed that the Janitor was the victim of
a Joke â¢ played by mischievous type*
writer girls employed in an attorney's of

hours to finish ; up some work and had
been to a neighboring restaurant to get
supper." One of them took a banana from
the table when she was leaving and when
they saw the Janitor at work one of them
suggested that It would be a good Joke to
frighten him. Armed, with the banana,
they entered the office and demanded of
the ; Janitor that he surrender his loose
change. "When he commenced to yell they
became frightened and ran to the office
where they are employed.

BRIEF LOCAL NEWS.
"CThe reputation of Captain "Ward Is too
well known to be affected by any charges
brought against him by the officials of
the Pacific Mall ' Company, and- it would
have been In better taste for them to
have awaited the dtcision j of the official 5
Inquiry before they started to place tho
blame for the loss of the Rio de Janeiro
on a brave man who lies many fathoms
beneath the waters of the bay."
With reference to Pilot Jordan'B state.
"I am familiar with the rules of
ping and . marine insurance and I state
positively that when a pilot boards a ship
he is supposed to be 'the 'only judge of a
proper time to tako the ship Into port.
If the captain thinks that the pilot is in
error then the captain has the right to
give orders to the pilot.
world and I think 1 am qualified to talk
as to the rules governing pilots and cap
tains. The rule all ever the world Is that
when a pilot comes aboard a ship the
pilot is in" sole command* Of the
pilot is supposed to act as a guide to
the captain, who never loses his command
of his ship. It is difficult to explain this
in proper language. AVhat I meaji is this,
when a pilot boards a ship the pilot is
supposed to give all orders and take the
vessel into . port at the time he thinks
proper. While he, the pilot, is In sole
command tho captain has the right to
Judge of the orders of the pilot and if
necessary take the command out of the
pilot's hands. That Is what I mean by
saying that the pilot is In sole command
of a ship from the time he gets aboard
and that the captain is sole commander
of his ship. The pilot is but a temporary
commander nnd If he Is making a mis
take the captain has the power to rectify
the error."
Among Insurance men the samÂ» idea
was expressed, that the pilot was respon
sible for the Rio de Janeiro from the time
he boarded the vessel on Thursday even
ing at 5 o'clock until she was wrecked,
and that Captain Ward had no reason to
countermand the orders of Pilot Jordan.
"I don't think for a single moment that
brave Captain Ward was to blame for thÂ«>
disaster," said a well-known marine in
surance manager yesterday. "And while
I did not know him 1 want to champion
the cause of a man whose lips are sealed
In death. It is easy enough for people to
say that Captain Ward was responsible
for the accident because tho ship was
brought into port during the existence of
a fog.
"Pilot Jordan has stated that he ordered
the anchor to be hoisted, and this in itself
shows that the pilot, was In command of
the vessel. If Jordan was not in charge
what right had he to order the anchor
to be hoisted? If ho was not in charge
would the "crew have obeyed his orders?
He gave those orders to the officers on
the bridge and those officers sent those
orders to the engine- room. Would those
officers have sent the orders of Pilot Jor
dan to . the engine-room if they did not
recognize '. the right of. the - pilot to give
them? , '

GREAT LOSS SUSTAINED
BY THE DEATH OF WHITE
BUT one man lives who can tell
upon whom the responsibility for
the loss of the steamship Rio de
Janeiro and her precious freight
, of lives an-1 merchandise should
rest, end that man Is Pilot Fred
erick Jordan, who was on the
bridge of the 111-faled vessel when she
struck upon Fort Point Reef yesterday
morning. With the passing of the first
poignant grief at the loss of so many in
nocent lives the question which now iÂ»
uppermost in the minds of all Is who is
to blame for the disaster.
Vice President Schwerin of the Pacific
Mail Company stated on the day of the
man whom he knows cannot answer him."
Considerable surprise was In
many" quarters yesterday that the boats
of the Rio de Janeiro were unable to get
away from the ship after she struck.
Quartermaster Lindstrom, who was on
the lookout at the time of "the disaster,
said yesterday:
"We had ten boats and twelve life rafts
and 400 to 500 life belts. On the. voyagfi
out we had five boat and fire drills and
the same number on the voyage home.
We had the last boat drill the day after
we left Honolulu for , San Francisco.
When we struck the rock every one re
sponded promptly and went to his place.
The Chinese crew behaved admirably, just
as if they were at drill. The Chinese pas
sengers were excited and caused consid
erable confusion. â¢ /
"From, the time we 'struck until the ship
went down about eight minutes elapsed,
and I think the best was done to get all
the boats out and get the passengers in
them. It took a few, minutes to get the
passengers on deck and while the work
of getting them into the boats was going
on the ship gave a lurch and went down
by the bow."
Quartermaster Lindstrom denied that he
stated soon after his rescue that Captain
Ward went below or locked himself in his
room.
"The captain simply came down from
the bridge," said Lindstrom. "and went
to his room under the bridge to get his
overcoat, as he only had his pajamas on,
and it was very cold. I was ordered by
the pilot to heave the lead," and when I
could not get bottom at twenty fathoms
and the ship started to slide off, the pilot
said to the captain: 'Get all your pas
sengers out. She will be sinking pres
ently.'" ..
The members of the State Pilot Com
mission could not be found yesterday, but
it is understood that they will hold an In
quiry Into the loss of the Rio de Janeiro
next week.
The United States local Inspectors of
hulls and boilers will hold an official in
vestigation next week. It is known that
yesterday they sent for the officers of the
Rio de Janeiro who survived and took
their statements as to the sinking of the
ship, Second Officer Coghlan being under
examination for more than three hours.
The greatest secrecy was maintained by
the Inspectors of hulls and boilers In mak
ing the examination, and it Is understood
that the object of taking the statements
is that when the official investigation is
held the inspectors will have statements
of the witnesses to guide them.
Coroner Leland yesterday impaneled a
Jury to view the eleven bodies recovered'
from the wrecked steamship.
The names of the jury are as follows:

Thejury, after viewing the bodies, was
instructed to meet at' the Coroner's office
next v Wednesday morning r at 10 o'clock,
when the inquest will be held.
CThe bodies of all the white people were
removed from the Morgue yesterday to
various undertaking establishments in the
city. The bodies of the Chinese were not
claimed until late at night. The Six Chi
nese Companies sent word to Coroner Le
land. asking that,the bodies be held until
an opportunity could be afforded to find
the relatives of the dead men. The Pacific
Mall. Company also sent. word to the Cor
oner that It wanted the bodies of the dead
Chinese in order that they might be'em
balmed and sent back to China.
Late last evening word was sent to Sur
geon O'Neill of the Rio : de: Janeiro that
the bodies would be delivered to the Mail
Company In accordance with Its request.

cf men who arc prominent in marinp in

with a number of marine insurance men

statements that when a pilot boards a

OAKLAND. Feb. 23.â Charles "E. JÂ«y
cox, who was lost in the wreck of the Rio
de Janeiro, was born and his boyhood
days were spent at Mount Eden, in Ala
meda County. When he and his brother,
Westley Jaycox, Â¦were quite young both
of their parents died, leavinjr them a large
estate. The children were left In care of
Mr. and Mrs. O. Dennis, who are now liv
ing in San Francisco .with Westley.
Charles reached his majority about a year
ago and his portion of the estate was
turned over to him. He left soon after
for Honolulu, where he had been ever
since. His brother and his foster-parents
wanted him to return to San Francisco,
and he took the ill-fated steamship Rio de
Janeiro. : \ . Â¦. Â¦
passengers of the ill-fated Rio de Janeiro
were found^ floating on the bay and were
taken to the Mail Dock. The mail sacks
were turned over to the postal authorities.
One box picked up contained the papers
of Captain -Ward, including his Masonic
and Master Mariners' certillcates.

Dispatches from the Bast, received in
San Francisco yesterday, told of the deep
grief which existed in official circles at
the news of the death of Consul General
\\ lldman and his family.
John B. Roach, president of the ship
building company which bears his name,
was interviewed at Chester, Pa., yesterday,
and when asked as to. the cause of the
rapid sinking of the Rio de Janeiro, said:
"The rapid sinking of the ship was due
to the fact that she was not built as
modern ships are-with water-tight bulk
heads dividing the vessel up Into compar
atively small compartments. At the time
the Kio was built this practice of insur
ing, the safety of vessels had not been
developed as it is to-day. The Rio was a
stanch and steady, ship, splendtly con
structed, and had proved her seaworthi
ness in a dozen typhoons, but the lack of
water-tifcht bulkheads was a fatal defect
In case the ship struck a reef."
A Chinese merchant of this city named
Ho lung Sang, of the firm of Man Lee
is. Co., 409 Dupont street, appeared be
fore the inspector of the Chinese Bureau
yesterday making Inquiries in regard to
his wife, whom he had been advised by
letter would be. a passenger on the Rio.
The unfortunate woman was the only
lady Chinese passenger on board. She
came in care of her uncle, who was the
captain's cabin boy and who made the
trip in order to care for her. From the
statements made by the boatswain and
those who met the woman there is no
doubt she was the wife of the merchant.
She is among the missing.
Miss Kate Hickey, a former resident of
Sacramento, is ( supposed to have been
one of the victims of the Rio de Janeiro
disaster. She was with Consul "Wildman
at Hongkong and was expected to ar
rive. about the 15th. No definite informa
tion has been received as to whether or
not she Â¦was on the steamship.
Philip Nussenblatt. one of the surviv< \
of the wreck, emphatically denies s I
statements derogatory to the conduct l \
Captain Ward after the accident and says
that Mrs. Wildman never got Into the
boat as others have stated.
Mr. Nussenblatt was on deck at the
time the ship sank and when he at last
rope to the surface he managed to catch
hold of a plank on which he floated until
nearly 8 o'clock, when he was reecued by
some Italian fishermen. He was severely
cut about the head by some blocks of
wood. Hi? wounds are doing well, how

day all of the artistic and otHer exhibits
are still In place and will remain until
Monday for the benefit of those coming

Martin Brady of Sail Francisco and Fred
L. Stewart of Amatlor County. They ar
rived by special train from Uklah on a

the exhibit and departed with three cheers
for Sonoma County.
.This evening's programme consisted of
some pretty selections by Professor

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Members of the Legis
lature who are well posted are keeping a
watchful eye on Assembly bill No. 806.
This measure proposes the allowance of
f 11,000 to be expended by George W.- Root,
clerk of the Supreme Court It author
izes him to fit out the offices of the clerk
of the Supreme Court with modern metal
lic filing and book cases and such other
furniture and fixtures as may be neces
sary for the proper transaction of the
business of his office. The Controller Is
directed to issue warrants payable out of
the general fund of the State treasury for
the sum of said appropriation in favor
of said clerk of the Supreme Court. It Is
provided that the act shall take effect
and be In force from and after Us pas
sage.
The State . Board of Examiners Is not
directed to superintend the proposed dis
bursement of public money. The Justices
of the Supreme Court are not required to
approve the expenditure. . The Supreme
Court Commissioners are not mentioned
as supervising agents. It is proposed by
the bill to give Root free rein to spend the
sum of $11,000.
Lawmakers who are familiar with
Root's official record will hesitate before
giving countenance to a bill authorizing
him to perform the work proposed with
out the assistance of an overseer. Those
who are familiar with his non-offlclal rec
ord, as well his official record, would not
vote away the small sum of $11 to be ex
pended under his sole direction. Â¦
The records of the Sacramento office of
the Supreme Court are piled around In a
disgraceful manner to convince the mem
bers of the Legislature that more money
should be expended to preserve the docu
ments In an orderly, methodical form.
Deligent inquiry may be ordered to ascer
tain if any â¢Â¦ money whatever la needed.
If it shall be found that metallic furniture
is required the bill can then be amended
to make some officer, other than the pres
ent clerk of the Supreme Court, respon
sible for the disbursement of the money.
There Is another Supreme Court bill
pending. It Is Assembly bill 796. author
izing the clerk to employ a stenographer,
whose salary shall be $900 annually. No
addition to the clerical force of the court
is needed. A trick was played- on the
Legislature of 1899. The clerk lobbied
through a bill permitting him to place his
deputiesâ four of themâ in the. San Fran
cisco office. At the same time: a; statu
tory provision compelled him to place two
men in the Los Angeles office.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO. Feb. 23.â Two weeks
from to-night the session of the
Legislature will close. That Is
the general opinion and Is a logi
cal one, too, for when the five pieces of
legislation now pending and of most im
portance have been passed ,up tc the Gov
ernor, there Is nothing on the file of either
House that can keep the statesmen in
Sacramento. Even with an ending on
March 8, the legislators will have held
over without a per diem, and that Is
enough to stretch the patriotism of more
than a quorum this year.
The five measures that must be put
through are: Apportionment, code revi
sion, county salaries, a primary law and
the general appropriation bill. It was be
lieved that code revision would fall by the
wayside, but if the 6peed of the past week
is kept up to the end, the revision bills
will slip through wlfh the ease of a cau
cus agreement or a Governor's pro
gramme.
The Ways and Means Committee Is far
behind with the general appropriation bill
and the excuse that it will be earlier than
at the last session can hardly be made,
for the last session ran seventeen days
over time and this one will not. The bill
has not been Introduced in the Assembly
yet and it must fight Its way through
that body before the Senate can touch It.
As soon as It comes out a copy will be
Fent to the Senate Finance Committee,
and that committee will commence work
upon it so that when it does reach the
Senate no time will be lost in putting in
any amendments deemed necessary and
not included in the changes made on tha
floor of the Assembly.
The general appropriation bill is prom
ised for early next week. _ . . . w
Apportionment should b*Â» finished by
Tuesday anyway, for 1 the Senate caucua
has practically agreed upon a course, and
as each Senator took no action without
consulting his Assemblyman. It is fair to
presume that there will b*- no material
departures in the Assembly from the de
cision of the Senate.
A primary law, a composite of all th*
' measures introduced upon that subject.

The Sheriff was Informed of the rob
bery and immediately dispatched Deputies
E. Lewis, W. Pinnell and James Cramer
to Berenda. Constable Crow of Berenda
organized a posse and went after the rob
ber. He arrested a young man who was
camped beside a buggy near the scene of
the crime. This morning the stolen arti
cles were found a Bhort distance from the
camp by Deputy Constable Vignolo. The
mask and pistol also were found. Pieces
of rubber, which exactly fitted the eye
holes in the mask, were discovered In the
buggy. The vehicle in which the young
man Is traveling Is believed to have been
stolen, as it answers the description of
one taken from a ranch near Tulare on
the 19th inst. The fellow gave his name
as Curtis and says he Is a son of William
Curtis, a farmer living between San Jose
and Santa Clara.
"Give me your money," he commanded.
"I haven't got any," answered Joyce.

"Well, give me that watch and chain.
I'll teach you to rubber at me."
And relieving the thoroughly surprised
farmer of his timepiece the fellow disap

three men were In an ante-room or the
ealoon playing cards. They, too. regarded
the proceedings as a joke, and did not
even stop their game until the masked
man had started for the door with the
contents of the money drawer.
MADERA. Feb. 23.â Joseph Joyce, a
farmer living near Berenda. a station
seven miles north of here, admits that the
joke is on him. Last night a masked man
entered the paloon of Thomas Costello, at
Berenda. and by the judicious display of
a revolver Induced Costello to deliver up
the contents of the money till. Joyce rrom
a distance viewed the proceedings through
a window. He believed a joke was being
played on Costello and he wanted to be in
on the fun. bo after watching through the
window for a minute or two he kicked
upon the door and Insisted upon being ad
mitted. The robber, who wore a mask,
had locked the door on entering the sa
loon. When Farmer Joyce, laughing
heartily at the supposed Joke on the sa
loon man, became too enthusiastic in his
efforts to gain access to the saloon the
robber, who by this time had finished de
spoiling Costello of his wealth, opened the
door and thrust tbe muzzle of his revolver
under the nose of Joyce.

A BTJB.NING DWELLING
surrounding the death of Captain Oliver
Dotson. one of the men who laid out the
city of Denver and was a. famous Black
Hills character, whose dead body was
found In his cabin in Washington Gulch,
thirty-five miles west of Helena, remains
unsolved, and the tragedy promises to de
velop one of the most remarkable- stories
of crime ever heard of in this region.
The officers, who returned to-day from
Washington Gulch, report â¢ the finding of
an alleged ' confession signed by Captain
Dotson. In which he declares that his son,
Clinton Dotson; his grandson. Oliver Hen
eon, and Ellas Perslnger, the latter from
Missouri, are innocent of the murder of
Eugene Culllnane, which occurred in Aug
ust. 1S99, and for which the younger Dot
son is now serving a nlnety-nlne-ye&r sen
tence and the otner two ten years' term*
in the penitentiary.
Dotson. in the confession, states he was
about to commit suicide and he made the
confession in the hop* of freeing Innocent
men.
The officers believe the confession to be
a clever forgery, but say they cannot
prove this until persons familiar with
Dot son's handwriting can be found. To
all appearances Dotson had committed
suicide. A rifle had been rigged up
against the wall and Dotson had appar
ently stood in front of it and pulled the
trigger with a string. He was shot
through the head. .,'
Some time ago the Warden of the peni
tentiary learned that a convict who was
released in December last had declared
that he would kill Dotson and that he
would leave on the body a confession pur
porting to exonerate the three men in Jail.
It is asserted that Clinton Dotson prom
ised to divide $15,000. which he claimed to
have buried somewhere in Wyoming, with
the convict If he would kill his father, and
secure his pardon. This convict was seen
near Washington Gulch last' Sunday and
cannot now be found. ": The â¢ alleged con
fession of Dotson implicated Edward
Cachelllm-ln 'the murder of Culllnane.
Cachellim is now County Commissioner at
Pierre. 8. -D. ,. He was a friend of the
younger Dotson . and Â¦ spent money in de
fending all , three of the convicted men.

Mr. D. F. Collins of Garnett. says: '1
commenced using the Pyramid Pile Cure
at a time when my case was bad. I
thought nothing could cure it. but before
I had used a 50-cent package I began to
feel much better, and now I can honestly
say I am entirely cured. It is the quick-
est and surest remedy I have ever tried
or beard of."
From Thomas Willson of Port Jarvis:
"Just one package of the Pyramid Plla
Cure did wonders for. me, and I lose no
opportunity of recommending such a rem-
edy."
Amos Crocker of "Worcester: "After
having gone through an unsuccessful sur-
gical operation for piles and after trying
any number of salves and ointments
without success It is no wonder that I can
find words of praise for the Pyramid Pile
Cure. One package did me more good
than all the remedies I had tried before.
It Is so simple and painless to use that I
felt ;no inconvenience whatever while
using It.".
It has been thoroughly tested by physi-
cians in every State In the Union, and the
best authorities recognize It as the safest.
surest and cheapest pile cure known.

LODI, Feb. 23.â Great anxiety is felt at
Woodbrldpe, two miles from hero, for the
safety of the bulkhead and levee built last
fall at- that place preparatory â¢ to putting
In a stone dam across the Mokelumne.
The river is up to dangerous high water
mark and on the rise. During the week
about sixty feet of the new levee began to
settle and give way before the pressure
of tho water, And' onlyrthe hard work, of
Surveyor Atheton and a gang of twenty
five men saved the big. earthen structure.'
They constructed a strong coffer dam of
brush and sacks of sand across the weak
ened portion, and by throwing off tho
strength of the current saved It from go
ing out. The hcavyt warm rain continuing
all last night will bring the Mokelumne
up to a dangerous point, owing to the
wow melting In. the Sierra*, and this
morning advices from Woodbrldge were
to the effect that It was feared the levee
would go out and the west bulkhead along
with It as soon as the flood .waters from
the mountains reached that point.
SAN DTEGO, Feb. 23.â The : conditions
are favorable for settled weather for some
time to come.' Last fogs have prevailed
for tho past few nights, but these are dis
pelled shortly after sunrise, leaving a
cloudless sky for the remainder of the
day. Under these conditions, and with an
abundance of rain that has fallen . this
season, the crops are in excellent condi
tion. The growth during the last two
weeks has been phenomenal, and as many
hundreds of acres of new land has been
planted -this season the total hay and
grain crop gives every promise at present
of being the largest in the history of San
Diego County 2 . The fruit crop also prom
ises to exceed those of all previous years.
Snow melting on the mountains Is stead
ily added to the water stored in the moun
tain reservoirs, and there Is, sufficient al

SAN JOSE, Feb. 23.â The weather here
during the past week has been a literal
alternation of sunshine and\ showers.
Since last Sunday there -has been : rain,
followed by bright Â«aim weather in every
twenty-four hours. The precipitation be
tween 12. o'clock last night and 9 o'clock
this evening was .05 of an inch; for the
week 2.36 and for tha season 17.22, against
10.S9 to'this date and 15.11' for the whole
of last season. At some points in the val
ley the rainfall has baen much greater
than in San Jose, notably at Los Gatos,
where upward of 23 inches have ' fallen.
Everywhere, however, moisture is abund
ant. In so far as it Is possible to esti
mate at this season crop prospects are
better than they have been for flve years.
FRESNO, Feb, 2J.-Such wet weather
has not been seen in Fresno in many
years, though old residents say that these
frequent alternations of short rains and
cloudy and foggy period have been
known i before. TlÂ»e rainfall up to the
present time is a fraction less than ten
Inches, two inches more than the average
for the year. Floods are reported from

past. few days have done much good in
this country. Farmers feel overjoyed and
declare that crop prospects are better now
than they have been at any time during
the past four or flve years.
STOCKTON. Feb. 2S.â This will bÂ« a
eight of anxiety for those having fortunes
e.t stake ln the crops on the reclaimed
Island and the lowlands below Stockton.
The San Joaquln and tributaries, includ
ing Old River, are rising rapidly. The
water gauge at the San Joaquin bridge
*hows the highest rise in eight yeair.
There is nearly eighteen fee* of water
there. Reports from the foothills tell of
heavy rains and melting snow, which will
reach here by to-morrow morning. â¢ Last
right's rain was heavy and is calculated
to send down a terrific volume of water.
The charnels, which were falling yester
Â£ay. are again rising at the rate of nearly
an Jnch an hour, but Stockton stands in
no danger as yet. The favorable situa
tion thus far is due to the cut-off made at
the Junction of the Stockton channel and
th<=- San Joaquln River, whereby the con
veying waters are given a straight fhoot
forward. Heretofore the San Joaquln
Ftruck the channel on an angle, stopping
thÂ« outlet, and. in cases of high water, so
corgest^.ig, the volume between the two
Island levees as to throw it up the channel
and back to Stockton. The only question
to-night is whether the river will continue
on Its good behavior.
It is reported to-day that Staten Island
was in danger of being flooded. The- wa
ter was near the top of the levee, which
tnreateened to give way at any time. The
levee is being patroled by men with
shovels.
A telephone message from Linden at 3
o'clock this afternoon said that the water
was rising very rapidly there and some
high water wa? looked for by to-night or
to-morrow, as it was raining in the hills.
A big force of men is working on the
grade between Linden and Bellota. which
is in danger of washing out and flooding
much territory 1 .
The breaks in the levees near French
Camp and on the West Side have not been
closed and water continues to pour in on
big areas of grain. A telephone message
from Grayson to-day states that the
water In the San Joaquin River at that
point is higher than it has been
in many years. Grayson is about â¢ 100
miles up the river from this citly. On the
West Side it rainod an inch and a quarter
in a few hours last night and it rained

heavily all day. The rain ln this city last
night was exceptionally heavy and per
sistent and at 9 o'clock this morning the
fall amounted to 1.02 inches, making 4.83
inches for the month thus. far and 13.46
Inches for the season to date, against 11
inches for tho corresponding period last
season. . . >
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 23.-Rain fell in
this vicinity all last night, followed by
showers to-day, including a short thun
derstorm. The rainfall for the season
is now close on seventeen inches, or near
ly four inches more than at the same date
last year. The river is well up, being
twenty-six feet nine Inches. Should it
rise another foot it probably will run
over the Yolo levees in low places, as it
has often done ln years past, and if the
San Joaquln remains high the water may
back up about the Islands down near the
mouth of the river and cause trouble.

with which .thÂ« burial of so arreat a son
of the church as Stepncn M. White must
needs be layested, aJl added to the im
pressive dignity of the occasion.
At 8 o'clock the men who had been
named to act as honorary pallbearers bÂ«
pan to arrive at the tioaa man's bom*,
â¢ihey were so many chat the house, large
as it is, could not contain them. A fsw
were irrouped in the parlors, but the iir,*
jwally extended down the lensth of the
piazza, out on the sidewalk and into the
streets. The very flower of the cltUeniy
or Los Angeles was Included ln this array
or pallbearers. Judges. Senators, editors,
merchant princes, litterateursâ the slants
of law and letters, business and politicsâ
were proud to be called upon as friendly
Â¦ervltors on this occasion.
Governor Gage was of this gathering.
As he took hU first look at, the features
of hi* comrade ln his coffln. tears were
ln bis eyes. He came aion* to the resi
dence, having traveled from San Fran
cisco-south with Mayor Phelan and the
following members of the Legislature:
Senators Ashe. Sims ana Curtin; Speaker
Pendleton of the Assembly. and Assembly
men Anderson, Melick. Scnilllg, Guflfoyle,
James, Cowan and Carter. Judge J. G.
Maguire and Hon. M. F. Tarney, lifelong
friends of Senator White, were with Gov
ernor Gaee.
These men, with a legion of their fellow
pallbearers, were grouped about the homa
of the dead man when Vicar General Har
nett stepped to the foot of the coffln and
read a prayer, and directed the transfer
of the body from the parlor to the hearse.
In the procession to tÂ£e cathedral mem
bers of the Los Ang<jies Bar Association
followed the pallbearers and then came tho
Native Sons of the citv. The Newman
Club, which had charge of the funeral,
followed, and after this club were the
family and friends in carriages. The pro
cession was many blocks ln lenirth. It
moved with stately, .solemn tread to the
cathedral, reaching the place at 10:05
o'clock.
Inside the cathedral busy hands were
at work arranging floral offerings, which
came so fast and In such profusion that
soon every nook, corner and crevice of the
altar and ratlins were in use. Among the
many brought direct to the church was
an immense broken pillar of white roses
and carnations, nearly eight feet high,
surmounted by a vrhite dove, with out- '
stretched wings. Down the pillar in im
mortelles was the inscription "Democracy
Honors. Our Steve." The Free Harbor
League sent a large broken wheel of pink
carnations with spokes of violets. From
the Los Angeles Bar Association came a
scroll of violets and smllax. The .Chinese
merchants presented their tribute ln the
shape of a large cross of white carna
tions and' violets. Ramona Parlor. Na
tive Sons of the Golden West, sent a large
anchor of ferns, smilax and white roses,
resting on a stand of smilax. The Cham
ber of Commerce sent a wreath. T. E.
Gibbon a white cross, the Terminal Rail
way, a violet anchor.
On arrival at the church Vicar General
Harnett, accompanied by two acolytes,
led through the rates, followed by the
honorary pallbearers. These were led by
Major General Harrison Gray Otis and
Senator M. Murphy of New York.
As the casket reached the door it was
placed on a catafalque and, headed by
the active pallbearers, wan drawn into
place near the altar rail. Following the
casket came the family, Mrs. White being
assisted by her son Will, the Senator's
brother and wife following. . ..
As the casket was being carried along
the aisle the choir sang a Gregorian
chant. Bishop Montgomery then cele
brated the requiem, mass. As Verdi's
music pealed forth the crowd pressed in.
Every Inch of space was utilized until
there was a solid muss of people reach

A POOR BREAKFAST.
Very Few People rat a Good Break-
"All I want for breakfast la a roll caj
a cup of eoffee." . . .
This remark Is heard not only In hotels,
restaurants ancj lunch rooms, bat It Is tna
usual breakfast order la the home circle
as well. After a twelve hours' fast it
would seem that the first nseal of the
day should be a hearty.' substantial one.
and if wÂ« all lived natural, umrtiflclal
lives. It would b# Â»o. but none cf us do,
hence breakfast is a merÂ» pretense.
Says a latter-day philosopher: "During
many years of active business life. I never
remember having eatÂ«n a gooa, substan-
tial breakfast, but suppose^ it was of Â»Â»
importance until I began to I039 appetite
for lunch and dinnrr.
"My physician tol<l me 1 waa a victim of

follow, as my business affairs would nnt
permit it. and to eat r*>liÂ»f I rÂ»sorteÂ«S to
medicines and pre3crlnt!oC3. and it was
purely aeeKJejitaJ that I hit upon onÂ© rem-
edy which aid the business. While in a
drug store one Â«j\f nlrts I noticed a number
of p>op!# buylnjr Stuart'* Dyspepsia Tab-
lets, a wide'y advertised preparation fqs;
stomach treubles. and tho force of ex-
ample was too much for me and I bougat
a fifty-cent package.
"I took a tablet or two after each meal.
and In a week my appetite picked up. I
began to feel my old ambition for work
returning and could cat a good breakfast
because I wanted it. and from that tlma
to this I take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tableta
as rejrularly as I take my meals, net be-
cause I now have Â«ny trouble with my
stomach, but because I don't want to
have.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 23.â Two volumes
of the testimony and exhibits in the
Cuban postal investigation were reported
to the Senate to-day. They consist in the
main of a mass of figures, the only new
matter of popular interest being state
ments made by ex-Director General Rath
bone and E. P. Thompson, Postmaster at
Havana, in reply to Fourth Assistant
Postmaster General Bristow's criticisms
of their conduct of affairs.
Rathbone's statement Is dated Novem
ber 20 last, and in it he takes up and re
plies to Bristow's charges seriatim.
Referring to Bristow's charge that there
was no contract as to prices in the pur
chase of postoffice furniture from the
Keyless Lock Company of Indiana, Rath
bone says that the statement is contra
dicted by Bristow's own report. He also
says there was a contract with the Hosier
Saie and Lock Company, giving this fact
as a refutation of Bristow's statement
tnat Xeely's authority was absolute In
the matter of purchase of safes, etc.
Continuing Rathbone says: "No oppor
tunity was given me to defend myself or
the service which I had created until the
second day before Bristow's departure.
The scanty time then available was de
voted by Bristow almost exclusively in
an effort to llnd some incriminating evi
dence against First Assistant Postmaster
General Perry S. Heath or myself, as the
interview shows. Xo opportunity was
given me to explain what appeared
against me or to make any showing of the
time and labor devoted by me and by my
subordinates in the building up of a
postal service from its very foundation,
nor of the obstacles that were met and
overcome by uÂ« as best we could under
the then existing conditions, but he sup
pressed documents, letters, etc.. which I
made a part of my statement."
Referring to the charges in connection
with the Neely "miscellaneous bills,"
Rathbone says: "The statement there
made Involves another case of suppres
sion, amounting to perversion of material
facts. General Bristow knew â for I told
him myself, and the officers of the assist
ant auditor of the department of posts
shows â that there were thirteen of the
"Neely bills," eight of which were ap
proved by myself as Director General,
and five of which were approved by P. H.
Bristow, chief clerk, as acting Director
General during my absence, when the
duty devolved upon him of approving bills
of this kind."
He infers, he says, from these and oth<;r
features of the Bristow report, that that
official Intended to "deliberately mislead
by a plain perversion and suppression of
facts within his own knowledge." He as
serts that P. H. Bristow (chief clerk rn
the Havana offlce) sirned warrant 70S7
for $12,000, which General Bristow charged
him (Rathbone) with slgnlnp, Another
transaction charged as a dereliction
against him, he says, chargeable to J.
\V. Irwin, a. subordinate of General Bris
tow.
Rathbone says there is r.o evidence and
that none can be secured to sustain the
allegation that he was "careless, loved
ease and refused to give attention to de
tails." On the contrary, he asserts that
he "worked hard, earnestly and long."
He savs that Auditor Laws he and not
Perry S. Heath was responsible for the
appointment of Dr. W. H. Reeves to a
place In the Cuban service. He charged
Bristow with suppressing important parts
of his (Rathbone's) testimony.
Postmaster Thompson takes ; exception
to General Bristow's statement that he
(Thompson) caused four money orders to
be i?sued to himself. He says that as a
matter of fact he purchased nine post
offlce orders, but that :n doing: so he com
mitted no crime; the shortage was made
good. Speaking of the Havana office in
a general way. Thompson says:
"The Havana. Postofflce was organized
under the most trying and difficult cir
cumstances and irregularities were bound
to occur. The origin and conduct of this
office was such that Bristow could find no
reason for a change, even in its organiza
tion or the number of employes required
to conduct It. I feel that, for a technical
mistake on my rart. I have been mo: t
outrageously treated."
Says Documents and Letters Which
He Mada Part of His Original
Statement Were Care
fully Suppressed.

bill to the consideration of the Senate
after thac measure had been sleeping for
many weeks. By a dose reading of the
proceeding; yesterday Morgan discovered
that the oleomargarine bill had lost its
position as the unfinished business of the
Senate, and with the calendar thus
cleared the Nicaragua canal bill regained
the status it held over two months ago
as the unfinished business of the Senate.
Morjran'e discovery created something of
a sensation, and this was heightened
Â¦when the presiding officer sustained his
position and laid the canalbill before the
Senate. Morgan's success was shortlived,
however, as the fortification bill was
taken up. thus displacing the canal bill,

Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
entirely of harmless antiseptics and may
be used as freely as necessary, as they
contain no cocaine, opiate or poisonous
drug of any kind.
Persons who suffer from ca.tarrh of the
head and throat are \*ery susceptible to
La. Grippe and such will find a ple&sant.
convenient and Â«afe remedy In this new
catarrh cure.
The first symptoms are those of acuto
catarrh. reyembUne a hard cold, and if
prcrrrpt treatment is applied at- this time
it ran easily be broken t;p. One of the
best remedies at this stage is Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets, sold by druggists every-
where, and if taken freely. Bay one tablet
every hour or two for two or three days,
the danger of pneumonia and serious com-
plications wfU be averted.
The Rev. L. E. Palmer. Baptist clergy-
man of Ceresco, Mich., makes a statement
of interest to all catarrh and grip suffer-
ers. He rays: "Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
have certainly been a blessing to ine. : I
have used them freely this fall and winter
and have found them a safeguard against
La Grippe and catarrhal troubles, from
â¢which I had suffered for years. I feel that
I can freely and conscientiously recom-
mend them."
The reason every one does not have the
disease at the same time is because the
persons who are enjoying perfect health
Â£re able to successfully resist and throw
off the infection, u-hile those who for any
reason are not in the best of health fall
leady victims.
No cr.e can escape the La Grippe germ.
because when an epidemic of the disease
is prevailing the air Is laden with it.
veyed Through the Atmosphere.
The Germs of IÂ»a Grippe Are Con-
IN THE AIR.

Duke, which closes the third act. I quote
from Mr. Parker's translation:
In the Theatrical World for 1S03 ths
same writer has an elaborate comparison
between Bernhardt and Dyse. in tha
course of which he says soma very un
kind things about the former. These I
shall not reprint, but shall content my
self with quotinjr what he says about her
Phedre. the only really fine and worthy
role Madame Bernbardt has played dur
ing her engagement here: "Sarah, airain.
has a more evenly beautiful voice than
Duse. It was never strong enough to
carry her to the heights of tragic passion
(?). There were always passages in her
Phedre, for example, in which she simply
ranted. But within its peculiar range it
amply merited and still merits the con
ventional epithet of 'golden.' Then sha
had and haa an incomparable art of
poetic diction. In the aforesaid Phedre.
where she does not overstrain herself. shÂ«s
speaks Racine's alexandrines with a
caressing languorous melody that is quita
indescribable and within my experience
unique. How Duse treats verse we hava
no opportunity of Judginc; but certain it
is that she has not anything like Sarah's
stistained melltfluousness of delivery.
There are sharp and almost harsh notes
In her voice, thou*gh she can. on occasion,
modulate it to the most penetrating ten
derness."
Whether Madame Bcmhardt has had a
worse effect upon M. Sardou than M. Sar
dou has upon Madame Bernhardt would
be difflcult to decide, but probably the lat
ter is true; for with all her eccentricities
and extravagances Madame Bernharclt
has a soul capable of great things â as wit
ness her Phedreâ while Sardou is merely
the cleverest stage carperter in the world,
wrfo will build you anything to order,
provided you pay him enough. Mr.
Archer (in the New Budget. June 6. lS9i>
once aptly described him ns an eminent
academicianâ most active purveyor of vic
tims to Madame Bernhardt. Kc then
added: "Here is a little tabular state
ment of the amours and homicides in
which Sardou has made himself her ac
complice. It will be noticed that in "Fe

MECHANICS' INSTITUTE ELECTION.
ALLSan Francisco has an ; interest- in -the election of .trustees of the Mechanics' Institute on 'Â¦
Tuesday; -Tm'S'is- the only city of metropolitan pretensions in America that has not a library
adequate to the needs of its people, and under existing conditions "the 'Mechanics' Institute
is the only organization to which we can- look with a reasonable expectation that such a library
will be speedily provided. > Â¦Â¦â¢â¢;'"?â¢Â¦ ; -' ; ' ''Â¦"
Until, a new spirit has been infused in the municipal administration.it is not likely the Public
Library will be provided with a suitable building and amply; supported; nor can we look to the-
Mercantile Library., with much Â¦â¢ of hope, for that: institution .for several .years past has had a hard
struggle even to keep alive; 'In the Mechanics'. Institute then; for the present at least, is centered
the hopes of the people for agopd library, and' it' dependsuipon tlie .'members of* that association
whether those I hopes\,will*'be : realized or^ disap^pointed. ; ' / V : : '
: Holding, its present position ofadvantage among the libraries of 'the city, the Mechanics'
Institute has onlyAtbrgo boldly^fdnvard ! to obtain the liberal;support of Â¦ ithev whole .people:- It- is r
human nature to follow that ; which progresses and to turn with indifference .from that 'i which hesi
tates;/ If ; thc;merrmers; of the a board- of trustees > who will provide "their- library '
and adorn, the city, with a stately and commodious building, if they, will rene\y the efforts to con- :
solidate with tlie^Mercantile and .other libraries? of^ the city on lines similar to those followed in the '
consolidation of -the great libraries in New Yprk;\if in short they build up a library that puts San
Francisco on something like equality in that respect with other large cities of the United Stages
there will be not" only a considerable increase of members, but a liberal support from* men of
wealth:; It would then soon be possible for the institution" to obtain 'the Bancroft Library* the
Sutro Library and other large collections of bdokson this coast. Once started, its own momehtum
would carry it forward. It would: grow like a snowball in motion.- Let us hope the association Will
be equal to the opportunity, and that on Tuesday none but live men will be' elected to the board
The Empire of the East was in business at Constantinople, where in 787 Constantine the
Fifth and Jiis mother, Irene, were running it. The era of the iconoclasts, the image-breakers, had
just closed, and Irene had won her final, canonization 'as a saint by permitting images of the
holy family and of other sacred persons to be put again in the Christian churches. So^no one in
that part of the worlofwhere Caesar and Cleopatra had gloried and drank deep was making coins
in their honor or to perpetuate their pagan memories.
We get the word numismatic from an old Greek root that means to distribute; "nomad-'
comes from the same root,-^and it came'to be applied to coin in the'sense of . its currency., .. :
. Mr. Chard's find is hot an important c6htribution;to numismatic science. It is simply a
corroded, old .Connecticut; 'copper cent, issued in" 1787. Â¦'. . A ; ,
: On the 20th of October, 1785, Connecticut issued a grant to Samuel Bishop, Joseph Hop
kins, James Hillhouse and John Goodrich,. authorizing them to coin coppers to an amount not ex- '
ceeding ten thousand pounds. This grant was for'five years, biit : the mint" operated onlyithree^
, years. The copper coins it made, have on the obverse a laureated, bust adornedwithfdrapery and :
â¢the legend "Auctori Connec." On the reverse is a- female figurie, seated, holding in the right hand
an olive branch and ;in the left a- staff; legend "Indeet : Lib." -The date occupies the exergue.
So this is only one of;Bishop & Cq/s old,red centSi a'coiri' that is far from rare. We are
'to furnish this information to, quiet the feeling- of envy that would swell the hearts of numisrnat
. ists like Mr. Chard' ahd w the : newspaper men who-have published- his great discoverv >' ' ' ' '
This information is instructive, if not at the same time amusing. The people who have been
at such expense to send this coin, by telegraph and put it in print should have reflected that
Caesar and the Sorceress of the Nile would not be put upon any coin of date A. D. 787. There
was no Roman empire to speak of at that time. In the year 476 one Odoacer ruled at Rome, over
what had been called the Empire of the West, but. he went but of the Emperor business and called
himself simply "King of Italy."
A TELEGRAM from Port Chester, N. Y., has, through the Chronicle, informed the western
world of the discovery of a numismatic treasure. The finder describes Jt as a copper coin,
with Caesar on one side and Cleopatra on' the other, with the words "Auctoris Connec''
keeping Caesar company, while the daughter of the Ptolemys sits near the legend ''Inde.et Lib,"
and the date 787. Mr. Chard is the finder, and. he says with confidence that it is the oldest coin
in America, having reached the venerable age of. 11 13 years.

This afternoon at the Tivo'l the Italian
residents of the city will do honor to the
memory of their great compatriot. Verdi,
la a grand memorial service. All of the
prominent Italian musicians will lend
their assistance, and the musical pro
gramme will consist entirely of Verdi's
works. The following most Interesting
programme has been prepared:
PTrcphony of "Nabueco" Verdi
"Ask for more" â that is indeed a char
acteristic of San Francisco, and some
time, an' the humor takes me, I will dis
sertate upon the encore nuisance as it
abounds in our town, with the spirit of
vhich diatribe Miss Jackson, encored to
ccath, will agree.
There is one thing: Miss Jackson is mis
taken in Imagining that we deserve the
trivial little modern numbers which ap
r<*ar on her programmes as an apparent
concession to our supposed "Western
tastes. Dear child, we take our "Ring"
solid in Ban Francisco, and ask for more!
It !s pprhar?" ur-ftratpful to speak first
ot the unsatisfactory side of a perforrn
ancc. but it now only remains to praise
fo far as Miss Jackson Is concerned. The
pirl is an undoubted genius. Her bowing
is rtelifrhtfull}- free and sure, her tone
moft flrtjcateiy beautiful, her ear accurate
ar.d her r^adir.ss of a breadth and fine
neps nothing short of marvelous in ?o
young a player. Her repose is deceptive.
nrrd thr>u?h perhaps an apparent physical
fradlity accounts for a lack of force
which occasionally makes itself felt she
is possessed of all necessary fire. Her
admirable rendering of the Bruch G mln.
concerto and an extraordinary perfonn
cr.ee of a Pasranlnl "Caprice," in which
the famous technical difficulties were sur
mounted with the utmost apparent ease.
Ftajnp her as an artist who in very
short time will find herself with the really
Treat people of her time. One can under
rtand, too, that at the end of a long and
arduous tour the young artist was not
heard at her very highest.
S^Iden Prs.it. the pianist and ac
companist of the little company, is still
a quite ypung player. He shows both
taste and temperament, but his technique
is of the rough-and-ready kind, lacking
altogether in finish, and the subtler beau
ties of tone nuance have not yet made
their appearance in Mr. Pratt's reper
toire. His= accompaniments axe discreet
and usually tactful, but his whole work
leaves an impression of insufficient study
and a rather irreverent viewpoint. Also
there are a number of not uViamusing
mar-nerisms, of the ultra-sentimental sort,
which Mr. Pratt would do well to leave
behind him. They never would be missed.

For the last few years she herself has
stood In need of help and ! sympathy,
making always a worthy fight for her
own helping; but now, . in face of this
crowning misfortune of her husband's
mortal sickness, the old artist can no
longer stand alone. Many musicians fa
miliar with the story of her life have
helped her to the best of their ability, but
more Is needed, and they have now com
bined to give a benefit performance,
which, it is hoped, will be of effective
financial service. There. is yet no pro

Jacob Mueller, to whom Mme. Fabbrl
was married after the death of Herr
Mulder, was a barytone of considerable
distinction, with a rich, cultivated voice,
and much dramatic ability. He came
with the artist to San Francisco In 1872,
and with her has been working In the
difficult field of pioneer musical endeavor
ever since. Many distinguished singers,
both European and American, owe their
success to the efforts of the Muellers,
Mme. Mueller being especially gifted as
a teacher, and many, many artists of
all kinds hold Mme. Fabbrl In gratefulest
memory for unwearying sympathy and
services at the disposal of an unfortunate
confrere at any and all times.
Her leading roles were Valentine in "Le3
Huguenots," Elisabeth In "Tannhauser,"
Leonora in "II Trovatore," Elvira in
"Ernanl," Anna in "I>on Juan." Bertha
in "IvÂ« Prophete," Alice in "Robert le
Diablo," Agathe in "Der Frelsehutz,"
Selika In "L'Afrlcalne," JLucrezla Borgia
and Recha in "La Julre"â in all of which
varied roles, lyric and dramatic, she seems
to have won an equal renown.

rrooably the greatest opportunity is now open to the counties in the Sierra foothills. They
have plenty of good and cheap land, picturesque scenery, fine climate, and great. productive
capacity. What may be made of all these advantages may be estimated by looking at Placer
County'on both sides of the railroad from' Rocklin to Colfax, or at El Dorado from Folsom to
Placerville, or at the region around Porterville, and at that bit of the' Orient dropped down like a
fairy carpet around Oroville. If every mile of the rich but rough looking land in the foothills were
equally improved the State would be immensely advanced in its material resources and popula
tion. The foothill counties should not drowse and forget their opportunity. -They should be
moved by the enterprise that thrills the valleys and do their part toward welcoming the heme
seeker and making him contented and prosperous. , S:
Those States get immigrant excursions, and the land jrrant roads have low fares for intend
ing settlers, to sell their lands, and all of these combined efforts of the people and the railroads
keep adding to the population. It is interesting to observe that there is a sort of displacement of
population by this process. The roads which carry land buyers and settlers into those States carry
land sellers and emigrants out. These have found the climate too rigorous, or they were temporary
settlers, intending only to homestead land, improve and sell it to raise a stake witlrwhich to suit
themselves better. That, class are looking to California, and California should begin to primp and
display her gifts and graces to attract and satisfy them. Our overland roads have put on an im
migrant rate that equalizes us with the South and Middle West, as far as the cost of travel enters
into the problem of getting settlers.
â¢ The railroads have touched the button and we must do the rest. The first note of warning
and call to duty comes from the State Board of Trade. That organization, is being overwhelmed
with requests for literature advertising California. The demand comes from Eastern people who
are accustomed to that method of getting the attention of migratory families. California must re
spond. The Board of Trade has literature from only a few counties and its own excellent reports
to send out. The counties should wake up, In a few months the State is going to be on view at

fote Amendments
Treaty Will Probably Lapse
Before Final Agreement
Can Be Made.
So far the United States embassy Is
without the vaguest indication of Great
Britain's reply. and Mr. Choate has not
received any summons from the Foreign
Office.- In the ordinary course of events
he will pay his weekly diplomatic visit
Tuesday, and K Is possible the answer
may be delayed .'until 1 then. ' Even that
will be speedy procedure for the Foreign
Office, as '. the. cumbersome machinery of
the Cabinet and Government offices work
much slower- as. a general rule. Unofficial
rumor persists in putting down Alaska
among, the subjects Great Britain Is de
sirous, of having se'tUed prior -to meeting
the NfcaraKuan.-c'anal demands.
It is -stated that tho Colonial Office has
been busily engaged in gathering Alaska
data within the past few weeks and this
may be taken-to some extent an confirma
tion of the. report. -However, Mr. Cham
berlain's department hAs â¢ serious doubts
as to whether the United States will con
sider Alaska and Nlodic'gua In one breath.
It may be related without a shadow of
donbt that the' Hay-Pauncefote treaty
will lapse, barYlng always the possibility
of the State Department's acceptance of
conditions that la ihe ordinary course of
eventB would take months to negotiate.
The counter- proposals are not made in
the belief that they are impossible of ac
ceptance, though; they are or rather will
be suggested, with thorough cognizance of
the fact that no satisfactory conclusion
could "be reached in the time remaining
before the Hay-P.au ncefote treaty lapses.
In the course of a conversation with a
correspondent to-day a responsible offi
cial satirically remarked that Great Brit
ain would be only too delighted to meet
the Senate's wishes if "the Senate was
equally willing to meet Great Britain**.
The mere fact that an- adequate discus
sion of the matter was impossible prior
to the lapsing of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty was 'a circumstance over which
Great Britain had no control, but which
he trusted. would not interfere with the
eventual settlement. ..-Â¦-.Â¦
LONDON. Feb. 23.â The draft of the
Cabinet's decision on the Senate's amend
ments to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty is in
process of being drav.-n up in the Foreign
Office. It is quite possible the reply to
Secretary Hay's note may be transmitted
through Lord. Paunccfote instead of
through Mr. Choate, though Lord Lans
downe has not yet indicated which medi
um he prefers.-' Diplomatic precedent
rather favors making Lord Pauncefote
the bearer of the . message. While the
exact nature of the British counter pro
posals' is still kept secret. It is safe to
pay that if- they arc considered at all by
the United States they will entirely pre
clude a conclusibn being reached before
the date when the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
lapses. .' Â¦
VAUGHAN'S STAND
ON KING'S OATH
Directs That a Communion
of Reparation Be .Cele
brated by Catholics.
The Cardinal says he broug-ht the mat
ter to the attention of a Cabinet Minister
three years ag-o, who told him the Govern
ment would not take up the subject. After
the Queen's death he wrote a letter to thu
King "couched in terms of â¢ fidelity anj
dictated alike of conscience and loyalty."
The Cardinal does not say whether he re
ceived a reply. The Cardinal commend*
the Catholic peers' protest and hopes
"this remnant of hateful fanaticism will
soon be removed."
The Cardinal's declaration says the
British Parliament, alone of all the Parli
aments of the world, declares two sacred
Catholic doctrines are "superstitious and
idolatrous." They are held sacred by 12,
000.000 of the King's subjects and beside i
the Roman church, the Greek and East
ern communities.
LONDON, Feb. 23.â Cardinal Vaughan
has issued a declaration against the antl-
Cathclic oath taken by KJnff Edward on
the occasion of his accession to the
throne and "with the hope of repairing
and canceling- the injuries thus commit
ted against the divine Majesty," he directs
that a general communion of reparation
shall be celebrated in every Catholic
church within his Jurisdiction the second
Sunday in Lent, and that in future tho
words "in reparation" shall be. prefixed
and read before the divine praises recited
after benediction.

The condition â¢ ot the peasantry In the
famine districts of southwestern Russia is
equally lamentable: but It Is worst of all
in the northern and east Volga, provinces,
where the people for two months have
been subsisting- on roots, srrasses and of

Russia's Relations With
General von Werder Instructed
to Discuss the Matter With
the Czar if Possible. >*f:
BERLIN. Feb. 23.â The two Russian
and semi-official declarations amounting
to threats of a vigorous tariff war if Ger
many, under Agrarian pressure, should
persist in levying heavy import duties up
on foreign agricultural products, have
been the chief topic of public discussion
here, both by :he Government organs and
the Agrarian inrt the anti-Agrarian pro*:*.
The Nation to-day contains a remarkable
article on the subject by Dr. Barth. the
leader of the Freisinnige party, review
ing Russia's economic relations with Ger
many and the United States and saying:
"The recent Russo- American tariff war
is of a temporary nature, since Russia is
systematically working to establish the
closest relations with the United State*,
not | only l commercial but financial, thus
assuming the position Germany has here
tofore occupied. This forms an inherent
part of Russia's policy. It is not only
M. de Witte's policy, but it is the policy
of the whole Government."
These statements, it is asserted, are
based on insidi information.
Privy Councilor Timiriaseff of the Rus
sian embassy In Berlin made statements
to a correspondent substantially agree
ing with the foregoing. He corroborated
the statement that thÂ« article which cre
ated such a sensation here emanated
from De WItte and said the commercial
treaty with Germany was concluded be
cause Germany sensibly reduced the du
ties" upon Russian cereals. If the duties
were now largely increased, including ad
ditional duties upon cattle, meats and
eggs, the whole basis of Russo-Germaxi
relations would be changed, resulting per
haps not In an actual tariff war, but In
a- treatyless era not much bÂ«tter than a
tariff war. The Kreuz Zeitunt now says
it would'.be better to pass the old Kanlts
bill, which would virtually create the em
pire's monopoly in grain, but which would
not interfere with Russia and would not
lead to a tariff war. This idea is taken
up to-day by a. number of Agrarian pa
pers.' . â¢ .
General von Werder starts to-day on a
month' 8 trip to Russia. The general saw
Emperor William thi3 week. It is learned
on reliable authority that while It Is true
General von Werder goes to Russia in re
sponse to the regular annual invitation
from the Czar, with whom" he. Is a great
favorite. Emperor William has Instructed
him to the effect that if, during his stay,
the conversation should turn that way.
General von Werder might explain the
actual state of the Anglo-German rela
tions and EmpÂ«ror William's motives for
his conduct during his recent visit to Eng
land.

Evidences are not wanting that indicate
a determination on their part to strength
en their positions, the Atchison and the
Rock Island by funning traffic connections
and the latter by constructing its exten
sion from Liberal. Kans.. to a connection
the Atchison to afford it a Pacific
Coast outlet. In line with this is the Bur
lington determination to enter Salt Lake
and a revival of the Salt Lake-Los An-
Celes proposition.
The entire difficulty In that quarter
erises from the determination of the in
dependent roads, or, rather, the roads at
present left out of the harmony of Inter

against the Southern Pacific-Union Pa

Missouri Pacific-Denver and Rio Grande

Despite all denials great vitality Is 6hown

IS IMMINENT
"Two important points should be de
manded by the powers," sttid Dr. Colt
man last evening. "Before the troops are
withdrawn from China an understanding
should be had in reference to the paying
of the indemnity claims. If these claims
are not paid in cash by the Chinese Gov
ernment they should be allowed to draw
interest until they are paid. Another im
portant thing for the protection of the
whites is that it should be definitely un
derstood that a large armed body of men
composed of soldiers from the allied
forces should remain in Peking, and
should be stationed there for the next ten
years. If white soldiers are left in Pe
king the Chinese will be afraid and will
have the proper respect for all the white
residents."
Dr. Coltman was asked if he expected
to be re-engaged by Li Hung Chang as
Ills personal surgeon. He said that he
had received no word from the great dip
lomat, but that he expected when
he returned he would be placed in the im
portant position he formerly held.
Dr. Coltman said last evening- that he
Â¦teas one of the largest claimants for In
demnity among the American residents of
Peking whose property had suffered dur
ing the recent Boxer uprising. He is very
much dissatisfied with the result of the
negotiations between the powers and the
Chinese Government. He claims that
when he made out his claim he was un
der the impression that the Chinese Gov
ernment would negotiate a loan and pay
the claims off at once. On this account
he made out the bill of his loss at $35,000.
Three houses that were his property were
leveled to the ground by the Boxers and
everything, with the exception of the
clothes en his back, was confiscated by
the rioters.
Dr. Robert Coltman Jr., former surgeon
to Li Hung Chang and professor In the
Imperial University at Peking. Is at the
California Hotel. He is on his way back
to China from Chicago, where he has been
spending a much needed vacation.

ern districts are still In the preparative
stage to a large extent, drilling In some
localities, gettlrj? up derricks and bring
ing in machinery In others, and hope
rules many investors. By the middle
of the summer many things will be dem
onstrated In the northern districts which
are still somewhat a matter for conjec
ture. Meanwhile the oil fever Is con
stantly rising.
The Nay and Gossage ranches, north of
Petaluma, nave been leased for oil. ex
ploitation.
Demand for land In what Is known as
'the Nesperian district, in Butte County,
continues. Seven oil locations have Just
been filed with the County Recorder at
Oroville.
; "An entirely new field has been i discov
ered in Los Angeles In the vicinity, of tha
old * Temple â¢ road and < Bellevue - avenue.
Since the midweek oil article in this pa
per there have. been no discoveries of oil
on a large scale In any field. The north. -
The plaintiff.' It . !Â¦ true." has been deprivÂ«d
of her oil taken and sold by the defendants.
But by the rules of : law Â¦ concerninr > the
measure of damages she is entitled to the full
Ktobs value of all the oil taken and Â¦ sold :. by
the defendants, without deduction either for
thÂ» running expenses of the pumping plant by
which. it was extracted.; the expenses or storing
and marketing the oil or of drilling the well
from which It was taken. : And in estimating
the damages above given, no allowance was
made for either of these Items, although it was
shown that the defendants have expended $4500
for drilling the well. J1M0 for deepening tha
same and about $750 for pumping and market
ing the oil, making about $C76O In all. It Is
reasonably certain that i the plaintiff â¢ herself
could not have obtained this oil . without the
expenditure of an equal sum of money. And
yet under the rules of law in relation to dam
ages ' for trespass and waste the defendant
must pay the plaintiff for all the oil they ob
tained with no offset for expenses. Â¦ They are
thus mulcted to the amount of $6000 for their
misconduct In endeavoring to obtain the plain
tiff's property for nothing, and the plaintiff la
gainer to the . extent of $20CO, which the ; re
ceives free , of . expense. : ' . *
In the case of'lsom vs. Book, at' Los
Angeles, Judge Shaw has found; that the
plaintiff is entitled to damages in the
amount of the price received for- thÂ«: oil
taken from her property and sold: by, the
defendant. This was a peculiar case.
The plaintiff set up that , her land was
leased without her receiving, any intima
tion that oil was to be taken from it. . In
the decision some statements were made
that place the case in the ranks of the
unique. . One paragraph : Is as follows; â¢?,
Petaluma has an oil company with a
capitalization of $500,000. According to
the Petaluma Argus, none of the stock
will be placed on the market, but a close
corporation will be maintained..
Machinery has been received at Chico
and drilling is to determine the Interest
ing question for the oil investors in that
locality.
There . 1Â» reported to be a natural gas
well Utf-feet deep not far from Termlnous,
the place in Ban Joaquin County where
J. W. Dougherty discovered oil. - The
Lodi Sentinel Bays that Dougherty re
ports that the oil came from a seam in
a levee. The material In the levee was
dredged out of the river: about a year
ago. -
There Is still trouble In thÂ« Kern River
district on account of the shortage of
cars. One of the largest producers makes
the statement that his company Is unablo
to fill its orders because . there are not
available cars to take the oil to the pur
chasers. The pumps are kept- running as
usual, and the result is that there is a
large accumulation of oil. Unless there
is some relief some of the companies, ac
cording to the same authority,, will have
to stop pumping for a time.
The Los Angeles Times figures out that
fully $14,000,000 in cash has been invested
In California oil lands Jn the last few
months, and that the oil industry In the
State represents a capital of $116,000,000.
A real estate boom is reported to have
struck Las Animas, Santa Barbara Coun
ty, as the result of a strike. Thirty-five
oil claims are reported to have been filed
at Las Animas recently.
Porter Bros.' large fruit packing plant
at Healdsburg Is being fitted up to use

Petaluma silk mills are also being simi

Gilroy parties recently called in Alfred
Onn of Watsonville to give an opinion con
cerning oil Indications in the vicinity of
Gilroy. E. D. Crawford says that if an
unofficial report is verified lands in the
Milne ranch will be transferred to the oil
company formed in Gilroy and drilling will
begin.
Preparations for drilling have been
made by a company on the line between
San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties.
An outfit has been purchased to put on
the old sawmill flat on the Pescadero
Creek near Pajaro. </Â¦*
The Salinas Democrat" reports that no
oil has been struck on the Naclmiento
ranch as yet, but the surface indications
are considered by a writer in that paper
to be favorable.-
The people of Wheatland have an idea
that they can utilize an artesian well bor
ing machine in drilling ror oil. according
to the Wheatland Four Corners.
Machinery and drillers have arrived at
Santa Cruz and the quest for oil in Santa
Cruz is now fairly on.
J. M. Pearson of Los Angeles is fluoted
by the Tehachapi Tomahawk as express
ing the opinion that the region about Te
hachapi will he a good oil section. The
particular lands that appear to be in favor
are In the low hills south of the town.
Only last week a San Francisco paper con
tained a glowing: account of a Loe Angeles
company which showed how over $163,000 a
year could be made from ten acres in the Lrfia
Anpeles field. The Ixis Angeles field is con
ceded to be a very good thing, but a company
just commencing business which can clear
J163.000 a year the first year, the second year
or any year would not need to go to San
Francisco to advertise itself and would very
likely not be selling Its stock at 25 cents a
ehare. Incidentally, It might be said that then;
Is a block of stock In this company In Los
Angeles which is for sale at 1 cent a share,
with no buyers in sight. The company men
tionedâor not mentionedâ bases Its figures on
the folio wine Burrositlon: On ten acres of
land forty wells can be drilled (for $800 each),
all of which will yield fifteen barrels a day
each for 365 days in the year, making a total
of 219.000 barrels for the year, which can be
readily sold at Jl a barrel, making & grand,
total vearly income of J219.00O. This looks
good on paper and is eailly figured. The fact
of the matter, however, unfortunately, is th*t
it won't "pan out." The average daily produc
tion of the wells in the Los Anceles field In
absolutely the same territory is five barrels
each. By allowing that forty wells had actu
ally been drilled, and giving to each the aver
age production of other wells in demonstrated
territory, and granting that It all can be sold
at $1 a barrel, it brings the grand total in
come for a year to $73,000, a email difference
of $H6,000.
Another company is about to begin ope
rations In the Devils Den country.
The experiences that the Los Angelnos
have been having In marketing their 'oil*
at prices far below what they formerly
considered to be a matter of course is
one point. Another Is the attention that
the Standard OH Company Is paying to
California olL It la now offering a better
price in the Kern "River district than
the Producers' Association. If this is not
an Indication that It desires to control
the output of that section and plans to
do it, then there is no indication in signt
of any value in that regard. Los Angeles
Is now bewailing because oil has been
offered there at 79 cents. If there Is high
er grade oil at a lower depth, the pro
ducers, having already their lands, may
find that the additional expense of drill
ing deeper is money well invested. All
producers will watch the Grace experi
ment. A better grade of oil would give
the prices of the Kern district lands an
other upward tendency. Ultimately the
value of any proposition is to be based
upon the per cent it will pay upon the
capital actually invested. Profit demon
strated, by the way. is all that is needed
to get Eastern capital into California oil
enterprise.
The Los Angeles Herald tells the fol
lowing oil Btory:
The Grace Oil Company, which Is oper
ating In the Kern River Held, Is still drill -
Ing- toward the center of the earth anti
the purpose Is announced to be to see
what there Is at lower levels than have
yet been reached In the district. One well
Is down 1500 feet, which Is much lower
than the majority of the wells In the
Kern River district, and it is soing still
lower. It will be recalled by the readers
of oil news that an Interview appeared in
this paper with State Mineralogist Coop
er, some months ago, In which he was
represented as expressing the opinion that
not only could there be found more pro
lific sands at lower than at higher levels,
but, also that the deeper oil would be
found to be of higher quality and there
fore more valuable as a marketing prop
osition. If he Is right, there Is ample
justification for searching for high-grade
oils.

Prof. J. Ernest Trudel. Hedleyville, Quebec, Canada, writes: "Dr. Sage's won-
derfuh course in Personal Maenetlsm and Hypnotism is the only work of its kind
containing Information that any person can readily learn and apply. It certainly
reveals the secrets of personal Influence; It develops In one a power, a forco of
character that I did not think it possible to acauire."
Dr. Abbie Heath. 71 Dover Street. Boston, Mass.. writes: "By the Information
received from the New York Institute of Science I cured a Mr. Scott of the tobacco
habit In two treatments. It Is now six months since, and he can not touch tobacco.
I have used Hypnotism several times to control the excruciating pain of cancer
and to eradicate pernicious habits In children."
M. B. Furry. No. 417 East Second Street, Wilmington, DeL. -writes: "I hypno-
tized a young man within three hours after receiving my first. Instruction. Ha
could neither sing nor dance. I made him sing three coon songs .and dance a regu-
lar buck dance â he thinking he was a stage performer."
Mr. Frank Muehl. Fairwater. Wls.. writes: "I have thoroughly tested the prac-
tical value of Personal Maenetlsm and Hypnotism as exDounded by the New
York Institute of Science, and I am agreeably surprised at the results. The infor-
mation la invaluable. I see life anew. Wonderful possibilities have be*n opened
up to me."
From the letter flies of the Institute 100 names were taken at random. Let-
ters w*>re addressed to these persons, asking them to tell freely what they thought
cf the Institute and the benefits they had derived from the Instruction. The replies
received were a revelation. All hac achieved success to a greater or less decree,

NAPA, Feb. 22.â There are prospects that Berryess*
Valley, northeast ot this city, will become one of the
preat oll-produclngr sections in California, Slnc-3
Thomaa A: Finnell. an expert of 'forty years" experi-
ence, discovered oil on the Harris place, Napa capital
has beÂ»n invested dally, and now there are ten com-
panies incorporated. It is estimated that $55,000 of
Napa county money has been put Into oil stock.
Several oil experts from San .Francisco and Bakers-
fleld have visited the Berryessa fields, and they claim
that the Nana County product Is superior to any yet
discovered in the State.
On tho Harris place the oil is seeping: out of the well
that was discovered there by Finnell at the rate of sev-
eral barrels a day. At the Knoxvllle mines there is a
flow that nets thirty-six gallons a day. Five thousand
acres of land have been located upon since the discov-
ery was made. Â¦ .
Last October a miner prospecting for sold opened up
a Email flow of oil. but did not realize the importance
of his find, and It was only after Finpel- put In a blast
and observed tho results that oil prospecting began se-
riously.
ThÂ» oil lias been analyzed by one of the best known
chemical exosrts of San Francisco. A number of com-
mercial products were prepared and a full report of
the analysis and prices of oils produced can be had by
applying to the company for their prospectus. This
oil la said to be worth from $S to $9 per barrel.

The clipper bark Santiago has made the
record rvr. of the feaeon from the Ha
waiian Is!ar.d.=. The distance between
Hilo and the lightship was covered In an
hour lees than ten days, but then for the
succeeding three days the wind blew from
al points of the compass and the captain
had to stand off shore. The bark finally
made port Friday night, thus completing
the voya.ge in thirteen days.
ThÂ« barkenttae Archer was the only ar
rival yesterday. She came from Hono
lulu and It took her twenty-flve days to
cover the 2100 miles. The Archer met
with the sajne fate as the Santiago and
Â¦was outside for four days before a favor-

Comments on the Food Question.
"I had a very curious experience with
food and its relation to the body. Some
tine ago, from unavoidable exposure to a
high wind for some time, I was attacked
seriously with neuralgia in the head.
Â¦which ultimately became chronic, and I
Buffered much, aa added to the pain I had
a Btrangre roaring: or surging: sound in my
head, which kept me awake at night, and
was of the most unpleasant character.
"It waÂ» no. in the ears, but seemed in
the very center of the head, and was ex-
tremely distressing. Occasionally I had
tflzzineFS come over me with the strange
roaring. Marines seemed to produce no
bTieflrial result. I finally concluded that
the famous brain food known as Grape-
Nuts would he the proper thing for me to
use. and I started in. using it every day.

In all probability the merchants and
other creditors having back claims
against the city will be obliged to waive
the legal interest on such claims when
tho old Indebtedness Is finally settled.
This point has been decided upon by
Auditor Wells, who said yesterday that
he would so' recommend to' the Board of
Supervisors at a conference' shortly to be
held, when action on the proposition of
redeeming the claims will be taken.
The constitutional amendment adopted
at the last election provides for the pay
ment of interest at the rate of 7 per cent
per annum on claims'of 1S93, 1894, 1895. 1896
and 1S9S. The Auditor has figured that the
city owes about $330,000, on which the in
terest at the rato named will amount to
something like $90,000. Some of the claims
which have been revived by the amend
ment have been running since 1893 and
the interest thereon will reach a tidy fig
ure. Auditor AVolls is of the opinion that
the creditors should be willing to- surren
der their rights in the matter of inte/est.
He says that most of the claims were
given up long ago by their holders, they
having in many cases written off the
amounts on their loss accounts. Now that
the face value of the claims Is within
their grasp -Wells think.-! they should be
willing to accept it without imposing an
additional burden on the city.
. To pay the principal and interest of the
claims will require about $450 .000. accord -
Ing to "Wells' figures. He estimates that
there will be $2M),000 available from the
surplus fund remaining in the city treas
ury at the end of this fiscal year. If the
interest, amounting to $100,000, Is waived
by the creditors there will be but $90,000
to be raised by the levy of a special tax
on July 1, 1001. This would necessitate a
rate of but a fraction over 2 cents on
every $100 assessed valuation, with the
total roll estimated at $410,000,000.
The Auditor is receiving many answer*
in response to his circular which he sent
to the various creditors with a request to
furnish itemized statements of their
claims in order that he may Â¦ compare
them with his books. He was much rur
prised to. receive a reply from' R. F. Os
born & Co. to the effect that the firm has
no ; claim against the city. Considering
that; the firm Is on the Auditor's books
for claims of $43 50 and $15 17. which ap
pear as not having been paid, Wells be
lieves that there are some honest people
in the world yet.- Another firm writes
that its claim is much less than noted.
â¢ while others have sent equivocal answers,
leading the Auditor to believe that they
have no knowledge of the claims other
than that furnished by the Auditor's cir
cular. Wells explains the discrepancy by
saying that some of the claims may have
been paid out of other funds and not post
ed on^ the original accounts. He thinks
that his first estimate of the city's in
debtedness may be somewhat reduced.
Auditor Will So Recommend
in Settling City's
j Indebtedness. :

of the Mutual Electric LJjjht Company,
testified that his company was supplying
arc lights to the Harbor Commissioners at
a cost of J2 per llpht a week: The other
companies charse $2 50 for the same qual
ity of light tn the downtown district. Ho
did not think that 25 cents, or even p
cents per arc light per night was too high.
He explained that while he furnished the
lights for $2 a week his lights were not ex
posed to the elements. Consequently
there were few globes broken and the car
bon points were not as quickly consumed.
The saving in carbon points and globe's
mnde it possible to sell lights at a" rate
lower than the other companlea.
The further Investigation Into the cost
of electric lighting was postponed until
the regular meeting to-morrow, when En
gineer Jones will produce his books, show
ing the cost of the plant and the profit, if
any, made in electric lighting .
Customs Collector Stratton was notified
yesterday by the Treasury Department
that It would be proper to Institute suits
against the PaciHc Mall Steamship Com
pany for damages for the escape from
the detention shed at the Mail dock of
eleven Chinese and three Japanese immi
grants who were being held by the steam
ship company pending the decision of the
Collector as to their right to land.
The notification came in the form of a
decision by Maurice D. O'Connell. Solici
tor of the Treasury Department at Wash
ington, in the case of the escape of a Chi
nese cook from the ship A. J. Fuller In
the harbor of Kahulul, Hawaii. Hon.
John C. Baird, United States Attorney
for the district of Hawaii, had rendered a
decision in that casa that the master of
the vessel was not liable to the penalty
provided by section 2 of the act of July
5, ISSi. because of his mere neglect prop
erly to guard the Chinaman. Mr. Baird
held that it would have to be showa that
there was some collusion on the part of
the master to render him liable to the
penalty of $500. The matter was taken
to the department and Mr. Balrd'a ruling
was reversed by Solicitor O'Connell
.. Â° Conne11 Quotes section 2, as fol
v^f^ 0 " V" 1^ 1 * 1 tfie master of any vessel who
shall knowingly brlnsr within the United States
on such vessel and land, or permit to be landed
any Chinese laborer from any foreign port or
place, shall be -guilty of a misdemeanor, and
on conviction thereof, shall be punched by a
One of rot more than J3C0. *
Mr. O'Connell says in his decision:
I do r.ot aerte with the District Attorney in
hlÂ« view that there murt be some "â¢lii/ma
tion - act on the r>art of the master, euch us
connivance or collusion, to render him amen
able to the statute. I think that the law. in
tends that the master of a vet&el shall t*ke
proi>er and needful i>recautions to prevent the
landing of Chinese laborers from his vessel
and that, in the case of a landing, the failure
to take *uch precautions Is *to "permit" the
laborer to be landed, within the meaning of the
Btatute. I think that the Matute reaches as
well a cane In which the landing; is the result
m the negligence of the roaster as one In whi"h
he expressly . gives his consent . to the landing
This Clitinction the statute recognizes by al
lowing the liRiXMiltion of a fine "not excelling
five hundred dollars." In the case In which
the negligence was not of a flagrant character
the court might consider a small fine surnclent
punishment.
The "detention shed" at the Mail dock
in this city is constructively the deck of
the vepsel on which the Immigrants ar
rived. They are in charge of the steam
ship company and the corporation Is re
sponsible for the production of the im
migrants whenever required by the Col
lector of the Port. The company Is not
under bonds* for the safe keeDlng of
these Chinese immigrants, and the only
law that requires the corporation to keep
safely the detained passengers Js the sec
tion Quoted. .
The United States Attoraw forbore
from filing suit against tho Pacific Mall
Steamship Company because he did not
think that the section applied to escapes
through neglecl. United States District
Attorney Coombs paid yesterday that as
roon as he had been officially notified of
Solicitor O'Connell's decision he would
present the mater to the Federal Grand
Jury. . â¢

a number, 6t tools. They also opened all
the water Â¦ faucets. A shoestore on the
corner of Greenwich street and Mont
gomery n venue was the next place visited
by the youthful depredators. They broke
in the door of the store and threw the
tools at the partition behind which the
proprietor was snoring:. He was aro # usod
bv the noise and rose to Investigate.
When he made hla appearance the boys
ran.
Their names are Arthur BIppel and Paul
Werner, and neither is more than 12 years
of age>. They broke into Helnze's plumb-
Ing shop Friday night and knocked the
knob off the safe, but did not open it.
They also sprinkled coal oil on the floor,
and evidently tried to set fire to the place,
as numerous matches were found
near the oll-sbaked boards.
The desire to make records for t"hem
selves as heroes of Â»ne kind portrayed t>y
dime novels has brought to grief two
North Beach small boys, who have, in fol
lowing the lead of the gods of their yel
low literature, been committing all sorts
of depredations In the neighborhood of

MRS. LESLIE CARTER, the fa
mous actress, will be sec^ again
in this city on Monday night, at
the Columbia. Theater-goers
have looked iorward with pleas
ant anticipation to her coming, and she
will be given a warm welcome on her
opening night, when she will appear in
David Belasco's latest masterpiece, "Za
za." a play that gives her every opportu
nity to display her wonderful ability as
an actress.
Mrs. Carter has not been here since her
production of. "The Heart of Maryland."'
Her splendid 'acting in that famous, war
drama won her a warm place in the
hearts of local resldenta. Her portrayal
of "Zaza" Is a wonderful piece of emo
tional acting and has established her rep
utation as one of the best emotional ac
tresses on the Kngllsh stage. Jealousy,
hatred, passionate love and womanlv ten
derness are exhibited in the fuM, grand
realization of an exacting part
An admirable company supports the
star, the completeness of the performance
being largely due to the fine work of such
players as Charles A. Stevenson, Marie
Bates. Mark Smith, Hugo Toland. Harold
Howard. Maud Winter. Herbert Millward.
Edgar Hart. Teresa Borta and others of
Mr. Belasco's fine organization.

The gas rate for the coming fiscal year
was practically fixed at $140 per thou
sand feet yesterday by the Supervisors.
There will not be any change from the
existing rate unless some other company
enters the rield when bids are cailea tor,
and that is altogether unlikely. .
When the Â£ui>erviporp, sitting as a com
mittee of the whole, resumed their Inves
tigation into tho matter of fixing the gas
rate Supervisor Reed stated that he be
lieved all the members were convinced
that the present rate of $140 was fair -to
the company and.. the consumer. "We
nlso know," said he, "that there has
been a raise in the price of material since
we last fixed tho rate. The'old company
also agrees to erect;, 150. cluster, lights
along 'ihird street. Market street and Vaji
Ness avenuo and light them jat a cost of
15 cents a lamp per night." â¢ *
â¢' "I do not see why Â¦these additional
lamps should be erected alo/ig those par
ticulur streets,"., remarked Supervisor
Dwyer. "My constituents who; live in the
Mission district are complaining that they
are being discriminated -against." -â¢
"It matters not to us," said E. C. Jones;
chief engineer of the San Francisco Gaa
and Electric, Company, "where the addi
tional cluster lamps are erected. We will
place them wherever we are directed by
the board." -Â¦â¢
Supervisors â¢ Boxton and Braunhart
thought that the committee "was acting
hastily In fixing, the maximum rate at
$140 per thousand feet. â¢,"! believe that
we should -look- further into the cost of
production of gas.'N said Braunhart.-"Un
limited oil fields are belne opened up In
this State," said he In conclusion, "and
much of the oil can be used In the manu
facture of illuminating gas. This oil can
be supplied much cheaper than coal."
The other Supervisors, present were of
the opinion that no harm, would' follow
the re-commendation of tho $140 rate by
the committee, and a motion to that ef
fect was carried. "We are not binding,
ourselves in any way,", said ReÂ«d. "Wa
are only recommending the maximum
rate." :
The matter of electric lighting was
next taken up, and Engineer Jones was
again called to the witness chair.
"At what rate per kilo watt hour is
your company supplying electricity to the
city?" asked Reed.
"We are furnishing power and light to
tho â¢Hall' of Justice for 5 cents per kilo
watt hour," answered Jones.
"Is it not a fact," asked Reed, "that
the Independent Electric Light Company
furnishes light for a little less than 4 cents
per 1000 watts?" . Â¦
"It may be that competition has brought
the price down."- answered tho witness.
"I now ask you." said Reed, addressing
E. J. Martin of the Harbor Light and
Power Company, "if tho company you
represent , does not furnish light and
power"at less than 5 cents per 1000 watts?"
"No. sir," replied Martin. "Our price
is about 8 cents net." 5 â¢
"Is it not true, Mr. Martin," persisted
Reed, "that you charge 12 cents where
there is no competition?"
"It is not," -answered the witness. "The
amount consumed and not competition
fixes the rate."
Reed then renewed the examination of
Jones and elicited the' information that 12
cents per kilo watt would only be. a fair
price. "We are selling light In some
places at a loss," said he, "and 12 cents
would make a fair average."
â¢ Jones was temporarily excused and A.
M. Hunt, general manager of the Inde
pendent Electric Light Company, was
called as a witness. He testified that he
believed 11 cents per kilo watt would be a
fair rate In outlying districts. . "Our high
est rate," said he, "is 9 cents, with a dis
count, and some. of our customers do not
"Use ther minimum amounts, $1 50 per
month.-I believe that 11 cents would be
equitable In outlying districts and from.
4 to 6 or 7 cents In the downtown districts.
If the city furnishes the poles we will fur-'
nish arc lights at 27^4 cents a night."

"The marvelous" success of 'Eben

â¢'5. Concerning the point that Professor
Ross gave occasion; for his: dismissal .by
remarks derogatory to Senator Stanford,
your committee finds that Professor Ross
denied all such chanres.^and In a letter
of November 16. two days after the dis
missal of Professor Ross. President Jor
dan said lni reference' to these charges:
'I never heard anything of the sort be
fore.' ,' '" . â¢ .....Â¦::
"6. There Is no. evidence to show that
in 1 the* opinion of-. the president of the uni
versity. Professor, Boss In his utterances
on the silver question, on coolie, immigra
tion or ' on municipal \ ownership, over
stepped: the limits of propriety. r On !the
contrary. President ., Jordan stated, in
May, 1900. that his; remarks on coolie Im
migration were .in . acqord with the drtf t
of public sentiment, on those subjects and
that even on. the sllvar Question he never
stepped outside of the recognized rights
of a professor.' . . '..;'Â¦
"7, There is evidence to show: (a) That
Mrs. * Stanford's | objections to Professor
Ross were due, in part at all events.'to his
former attitude on the sliver question and
to ; his utterances 5 on < coolie immigration
and on municipal ownership, and (b) that
while the 1 dissatisf action" of ; Mrs.'. Stanford
due < to his former attitude on the r silver
question antedated I his utterances .-1 on
Â¦ "4. There is no evidence to show that In
his published statement of November 11
Professor Rosa violated any. confidence
reposed in him. .On the contrary. In' a
letter of December .21. President Jordan
stated: 'I wish; after conversation with
Dr. Ros3, to withdraw anything I may
have said, Implying that he had knowingly
used confidential material, or In any other
way violated personal proprieties In raafc
nig his statement.' ; '
"3. There 13 no evidence that Professor
Ross gave cause for his dismissal beoause
of any unfaithfulness m the discharge of
his duties. On the contrary, President
Jordan stated, in a letter of May, 190!),
that 'he. has been most loyal, accepting
extra work and all, kinds of â¢ embarrass
ments a word of complaint,' and
that he was 'a wise, learned and noblij
man, one of the, most loyal and devoted
of all the band at the university."
"2. There is no evidence to show that
Professor Ross cave occasion for his dis
missal by Incompetence. On the contrary.
President Jordan stated in a letter of
May, 1900, that he (Ross) 'v/as a careful
thinker j and a patient investigator,', 'a
constant source of strength to the univer
sity,' and 'one of the best, teachers, al
ways just, moderate and fair.'
"L There is no evidence to show that.
Professor Ross gave occasion for his dis
missal by any defect In moral character.
On the contrary. President Jordan states
in his letter of Februaxv 7 to the commit
tee: 'No ground exists for any interpreta
tion of his dismissal acting on his private
character.' S '
"2. It has been asserted or suggested
that Professor Ross l^ad made statements
before his classes reflecting: upon the late
Senator Stanford: that ht had shown him
self selfish and lacking in loyalty to the
university; that he was erratic and fre
quently overstepped the bounds of acad
emic propriety in the manner of giving
expression to his opinions: that his pub
lication of November 11 was a violation of
confidence and that there are facts which,
if disclosed, would reflect upon his per
sonal character." \ .
Answering these reasons the report
says:
"1. Dissatisfaction on the part of Mrs.
Stanford with Professor Ross' expressions
of opjnion on questions of economic policy,
notably in regard to the free coinage of
silver In the campaign of 1S96, and more
recently in regard to coolie . emigration
and municipal monopolies.
"The question," Bays the report, "in re
gard to which we. have .been Cc-illed upon
to express an opinion Isf What were the
reasons which led Mrs. Stanford* to force
Piofessor Ross' resignation? 5 Two classes
of reasons' have been alleged:'
On November 5, the report goes on to
state. Professor Ross authorized tW pub
lishment In the n$wppapers of a statement
setting 1 forth the causes of his resignation
and- its acceptance, attributing, it to the
dissatisfaction felt by Mrs. Stanford with
his expressions of opinion on questions of
public policy, particularly coolie immigra
tion and municipal ownership^ On the fol
lowing day President Jcyda* wrote^ to
Professor VRossj stating ih> view" of
his published 'statement yitwai; desirable
that his connection with the university
should terminate immediately. . ' .. .
"It is customary for professors of the
Leland Stanford Jr. University to be re
appolnted early in May. Professor Ross
was, however, reappointed on June 2. On
June 5 he handed to President Jordan his
resignation, to take effect at the close of
the year 1900-01, in which he says that
he was sorry to learn from President Jor
dan that Mrs. Stanford did not approve of
him. Ross, as an economist. The resigna
tion, was not acted upon until November
5, when It was accepted by President Jor
dan, who expressed his high esteem, for
the work of Professor Ross as, a student
and teacher." .
When Professor Ross severed his con
nection with the Leland Stanford Jr. Uni
versity in November last his action and
the causes thereof were subjects of wide
comment. Professors Seligman, Farnam
and Gardner espoused the cause of Pro
fessor Ross and began an Investigation of
the matter. After correspondence with
the officers of the University and an ex
aminatlon of the case in detail the com
mittee prepared the report, which was
made public to-day. The report says:
NEW YORK. Feb. 23.â Edwin R. A.

By F. E. Mulholland.
JUST like a good politician. Book
maker Caesar Young's bay horse
Sea Lion proved himself a good
"repeater" at Oakland track yes-
terday. Only the day before he
captured the George Washington handi
cap, and with a night of refreshing sleep
came out and won the $2000 Palace Hotel
â¢handicap, beating, among others. Favo
nius, Bangor and Formero. The distance
was one mile and a furlong, and the
Burns & Waterhouse pair, Favonius and
Bangor coupled, were pronounced favor
ites In the ring. Again ridden by E.
Matthews and carrying but 96 pounds,
Sea Lion was as good as 7 to 1 at one
stage of the play. Favonius shouldered
322" pounds, and on class figured to do the
trick cleverly, still he looKtd beaten be
fore a mile had been covered. Formero
and Bathos did a stunt out in front for
seven furlongs, then gracefully made way
for better piayers. just about the time
Johnny Bullman â¢ made his move with
Favonius Matthews on Sea Lion did the
same. Favonius cracked like a' piece of
crockery falling from Mars when the test
came, and Sea Lion won by four open
lengths In 1:57^. After sulking almost
from flagfall, crafty Bangor moved along
at doubie-qulck time the final furlong,
landing the small end of the prise lor his
stable.
When the uncertainties of the weather
are taken into consideration, added to
the uncertain prospect of picking winners
tramping throivgh slop and slush, the at
tendance was good. The form chart will
readily indicate that upsets were numer
ous, for St. Rica alone saved the favorites
from a coat of whitewash. .
For an appetizer, Tristrain. a colt from
the Shulte stable, backed from 20 to 12,
left his field behind In the opening sprint.
Played before for a "killing." he never
showed, but had speed to ignite yester
day. Howell throw the throttle wide open
from the start and the outsider pulled
Into the depot four car lengths before El.
Karn and Billy Lyons. El Karn closed
a 11 to 5 favorite. r
In previous races in the mud St. Rtca
had been a disappointment, and for that
reason alone 2 to 1 was laid about the
gelding in the betting on the second event.
Now he is a confirmed web-footer, for
Dominick sent him out in the lead and In
a mild drive beat Foul Play a length.
Mounce on La Mascntta finished third.
The Burns & Watcrhouse tllly, Rosewar,
oid not cut much of a figure in the two
year-old scramble. She had a steady fol
lowing that backed her at 6 to 5 and ran
unplaced. When Zlrl. piloted by Bullman,
looked all over a winner the daughter of
Imp. Sain flattened out under the too
warm, pace set. allowing Dr. Scharff to
score at the home plate by half a length.
Louwclsea dropped into the show.
Ttansch, who rode Dunfree in the mile
selling affair, finally mustered up courage
enough to take his mount out in the lead
and won. The smart ones spread their
checks about on Rey del Bandidos, which
wornout piece of hardware refused to ex
tend himself. Dunirt-e experienced very
little tempestuous weather and outsprim
ing Morlnga downed that horse at the
wire by a length. From 2 the price against
the winner wont to 13 to 5.
Only Good Hope. Frank Bell. Tame
Irishman, Prestidigitator and Scallywag
answered roll call for the final number,
the Peralta handicap at six furlongs..
Good Hope occupied the honors of favor
itism in the betting and when leading at
the paddock was passed on the inside by
Prestidigitator and led out two lengths.
Frank Bell carried his 124 pounds as far
as he could out in front and then had to
accept third place. Little Hoar rode the
winner like a veteran and will some day
become a rider.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
By Louis Honig.
A DRIZZLING fog, a wet, sloppy,
mushy, miry, boggy, track and a
happy lot of "bookies" made Tan
foran an uncomfortable place for
the racegoers yesterday after
noon. The proverb that anything goes on
a muddy track held true yesterday. Many
things went at Tantoran, particularly th,e
favorites, which, with the exception of
two races, played star glimmering acts
in the background. Waring also went,
but In a different way. He went so fast
that all the others In the $2500 San Mateo
handicap spemed not to go at all.
Again the choices were toppled over and
stamped upon. Skip Me hopped over the
Held and landed at 10 to 1. Topmast rat
tled along in the breeze at S to 1, O'Connor
piloting both the3e winners. Periwig won
the jumps at long odds and last of all
came Bogus Bill, as good as 20 to 1.
Waring captured the San Mateo handi
cap, J-500 added, without much apparent
effort. Socn after the start Henry took
Hildreth's big purse winner through the
field to the rail and went out far In ad-
Vance of all the other mud-slingers.
Bunched together and riding on a line
splashed Imperious, Wyoming and An
disa. Autumn and Lavator far In the
wake. The race was only for the place.
Waring holding an unapproachable posi
tion all the time. Andrisa and Wyoming
began to light it out at the paddock, but
Imperious, ninety-six pounds, was not
counted on. Then came the finish and
Imperious spurted. There was nothing
to the race but Waring, then Imperious.
Wyoming and Andrisa fought for the
show, the former getting the money.
Waring went to the post at 4 to 5. but
Imperious, who got the place, was selling
as high as 50 to 1. Andrisa was the sec
ond choice in the betting.
The way Skip Me plowed through the
mud And hopped over the small lakes in
the track and beat out Invlctus, an even
money favorite, in the ilrst race, startled
the crowd. O'Connor got his horse into
the lead on the back stretch when Gaylon
Brown was passed. Then Mamie Hil
dreth and Birdie Stone moved up, but
Skip Me, 15 to 1, would not be headed.
Mamie Hildreth, IS to 1, got the place,
fighting it out with Birdie Stone.
O'Connor scored a second victory in the
second race over the mile route on
Topmast. When the prices were first
posted Topmast was quoted at 8 to 1, but
soon became 6 to 1. Alee, tho favorite,
led until the stretch. Donator, with
Burns up, was close in line. Topmast, with
furled sails, coming third. O'Connor then
threw the canvas to the breeze and, Top
mast blew in.
Periwig led all the full mile and three
quarters in the hurdle race. JO C and
Choteau had a driving race for place and
show. Veragua fell out early in the game
and The Californlan was pulled up.
The six furlongs in the fifth race was
run in a drizzling rain and was won by
Thracla. Cerro Santa was worked out
on the turn, Thornwild and The Gaffer
coming up from the stretch. O'Connor on
the favorite . rode a good race, finishing
strongly and winning easily.
The last race, a seven and a half fur
long course, showed another long 1 shot
under the wire ahead of the favorite.
Bogus Bill, who has been running better
than form, beat . Handicapper out in the
stretch. Dr.. Cave set the pace and was
done for when the, finish came. â¢ Handi

MIXED IN THEIR DATES.
"Mike" collected his $505. and moving
qiilcklv around to where the funny
"bookfe" was standing disconsolately,
said as he slid the gleaming double eagles
through his palms:
"Say. mister, I think I'll frame these
for you. You can frame the ticket your
self.". ;â¢-
"Say. why don't you. get back at that
bookmaker for 'joshing' you when you
placed your bet?"
"Begorry, I think I will," said the lucky
winner.
"Thank you kindly for the informa
tion," said the Irishman, who proceeded
forthwith to place a bet of five dollars
on Dolore. The bookie, thinking that he
had a "green" one to deal with, said, sar
castically, as he handed out the ticket
calling lor J500 to $5:
"Say, just frame that. It will make a
pretty picture."
The Irishman said not a word, but.wait
ed patiently until the race was over.
When DolorÂ© was hung up aa winner he
was the first one In line to; cash his
ticket. Hiester came next, and said to
him:
"Why, certainly," replied Hiester.
"There is only one horse 'to It,' and
that's Dolore. Put all your money on
him." â¢
"Say, me friend," said the Irishman,
"could you tell me what horse Is likely
to win this race?"
A gcod story is going the rounds, with
one of the Tanforan bookmakers and a
son of the Emerald Isle as the dramatis
pcrsonae. It was just before the race
which Dolore won at 100 to 1 on "Washing
ton's birthday. When the said son of
Erin quietly approached "Billy" Hiester
the latter was coming away from one of
the books, having deposited three dollars
on Dolore, which, with twelve others sim
ilarly placed, were destined to win for
him the sum of $1500.

With the finals of the reserve stake,
the Belle Brandon and the California
Plate events for to-day's attracTon Union
I'ark presents a strong card.
The results of yesterday's coursing,
with Judge John Grace's official scores,
follow:
The third round of the stake was run
yesterday. Aeolus beat his half-sister,
Amadee, which was the stake choice and
a favorite at 2 to 1 In the betting, tak
ing a lead of three open lengths and win
ning by a score of 8 to 3. Freeze Out,
another half-sister, had a run of more
than two and a half minutes and will
probably be withdrawn. Aeoius has per
lormed better than the remaining en
tries and the route looks easy lor him
to-day.
In the reserve stake Kid McCoy figures
to win, with Rosie Clair and Aeneas as
second choice?. â¢ t
George McE. Malcolm of Sacramento
named Sacramento Boy for the John
Grace challenge cup last year, and the
Boy won. Now Mr. Malcolm has his eye'
on the big stake to be decided to-day, and
he stands a very good chance of winning
the prize with Aeolus, a For Freedom-

MEN'S AMATEUR CONTEST.
DEL. MONTE." Feb. 23.â Rain poured
down all last night and at frequent in
tervals to-day, so that the golf course
was about in as bad condition as it could
be, the putting greens being the only part
of the links fit to play on. For some time
this morninsr it was believed to be im
possible to finish the tournaments which
Â¦were begun yesterday and the golfer?
were disgusted with the weather clerk.
The rain let up about midday, however,
and the professionals sallied forth to try
the finish of their contest. 18 holes. The
amateurs were not to be outdone, and
with grim determination and very muddy
feet battled against one another and tho
wet, slippery earth.
The Del Monte cup. first prize in the
ladies' contest, was won by Mrs. Chester
Thorne of Portland. Or., her score being
127. The cup 1 presented by the San Fran
cisco Golf Club was won by Mrs. TV. P.
Johnson of Oakland.
In the gentlemen's amateur contest, W.
P. Johnson of Oakland came off victo
rious. Second prize went to H. C. Bree
den of San Francisco and W. E. Ayers
and Dr. Morton tied for third place. C.
B. Kr.app and Charles Hubbard tied for
a special prize that was offered yesterday
for the best cross score.
The outcome of the professional contest
was not surprising to those who have
been watching the play of Smith and Bell
during their visit to this coast, and the
close finish was full of interest. Smith
won in 151 strikes for the 36 holes, cap
turing the $1'X> prize. Bell finished in l.">2
strikes and Jolinstone of San Francisco
took third r>lace with 139 strikes. Bell
made the best single round, making 9
holes in 35 strikes.
The complete score of the two days'
tournament follow, the totals being given
for the 26 holes played in each class:

Oakland Home After Suffering
Long Illness.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â Maurice J. Healy,
a pioneer citizen of Alameda County, died
last night at his home, 8a Harrison street,
after a long illness, pneumonia having
been the immediate cause. Mr. Healy
came to Alameda County twenty-sevn
years ago and has been prominently iden
tified with its Interests continuously since.
For all of the time of his residence he was
the leading tailor of the city.
Deceased was a native of Ireland, aged
68 years. He leaves a widow, Josephine
B Healy, and five children. The funeral
will be held from the late home at 8:S0
o'clock Monday morning. High mass will
be celebrated at 9 o'clock at the Churcn
of tho Immaculate Conception.
Naylor. The Question of rebates was
then Introduced and charges were made,
that pilots discriminated In favor of.
friendly shipowners, thus placing at &
tremendous disadvantage the men who
are not on good terms with them. Cap
tain Mighell, who owns thirty slhps ply
ing from this port, stated that since ha
had rebelled against excessive charges
two years ago, he had never received a
rebate. Captain Marston. also a large
â¢hlpowner, thought there were too many
pilots and that the charges were exces
sive.
Mr. Naylor recommended to the legisla
tive committee that only one Pilot Com
missioner be appointed, and he by the
Harbor Commissioners. Instead of threa
by the Governor, as at present, and that
the number of pilots be reduced from
twenty to ten or fifteen.
Mr. Craig then briefly reviewed the
abuses which he believed to exist. He
stated that the. San Francisco pilotage
system was corrupt and characterized the
pilots as â¢â¢pirates." Pilotage charges are
higher here, he stated, than In any other
port of the world. Immense harm had
been done to the city of San Francisco
and the State of California, he said, and
a radical change was highly necessary.
The representatives of the Pilot Com
missioners Intimated that Sacramento
was their stronghold and said that at a
later period they would be there with all
the books they had, which any one could
then inspect.
Assemblyman Radcllff asked. In refer
ence doubtless to the sad accident to the
Ill-fated Rio de Janeiro, whether a captain
or pilot had command of a ship entering
or leaving the port. All authorities pres
ent agreed that the captain never lost
command of his vessel.
to do to.
Messrs. Alexander and Conroy at this
point extended an invitation to all present
and to the public to examine the books
at any and all times, and disavowed any
inclination to withhold the statistics.
Mr. Naylor stated that he had mailed
a letter to each of the Pilot Commission
ers more than a week ago, requesting that
he be allowed to inspect the books, but
both Mr. Alexander and Mr. Conroy de
nied the receipt of any such communica
tion.
Hugh Craig of the Chamber of Com
merce said that he had constantly en
deavored for two years to see the books,
but could never get even an appointment
to do so.
Debate between the four gentlemen then
became so heated and personal in its na
ture that Chairman Newhall had to In
terfere.
The report of the sub-committee of the
Chamber of Commerce on pilotage was
presented. It showed, by statistics, that
up to two years ago the pilots, for eleven
years, had been working twenty-four
days every three months for a compensa
tion of about $330 per month. The best
paid ship captains leaving this port get
$250 a month. Other things hinted at
created the opinion that a San Francisco
pilot led a gilt-edged life of ease and
luxury, with only the duty of collecting
enormous pay.
Secretary Conroy stated that a pilot was
exposed to great dangers and that his
case was different from that of a sea cap
tain, that he had to board himself. An
Interesting discussion about the price of
board was Interrupted by Chairman New
hall.
Assemblyman Radcllft asked for fur

sor A- M. Wheeler, professor of history in
Yale University. In discussing the Philip

"Rome acquired foreign territory and fell;
Greece tried to become mistress of the

He further â¢ declared that the United

this. As ancient governments had tried
to get In power over other peoples, he
said, and had in the attempt ruined them

Somewhere on the high seas between
San Francisco and Tahiti Tax Collector
J. Harry Scott Is rubbing his hands in
glee and chuckling to himself,, while
Mayor Phelan is taking an Invoice of his
stock of gold bricks. The Mayor does not
quite realize, perhaps, that he has been
outmaneuvexed by the Tax Collector.
Meanwhile - eleven applicants who have
satisfactorily passed all of the require
ments of the civil service examination of
December 4 last are without positions as
deputies in the Tax Collector's office.
There were fifteen and they were all
Phelan men with ihe exception of four.
Of these latter George A. McCalvy, 43
Van Ness avenue, is as yet the only Re
publican without the fold. The others,
Ben I. Salomon, Joseph K. Jones and
James \V. McCabe. are numbered among
'the old Republican attaches of Tax Col
lector Scott's office. The remaining eleven
aspirants are the Phelan Democrats,
whom Collector Scctt has so adroitly
duped.
Scott refused at first, as will bs re
membered, to accept the men certified by
the Civil Service Commission, but after
some court proceedings and a threat of
removal from office by the Mayor agreed
to appoint them.
Together with his wife Tax Collector
Scott sailed at noon of February 11 on the
steamer Australia. At 11:40 o'clock on
that day, twenty minutes before the hour
of the steamer's departure, he notified
the Civil Service Commission that he
would accept the names of the fifteen ap
plicants who had passed the required ex
amination for deputies in his otllce. But
he did not notify the Auditor, so that
their names might be placed on the pay
rolls; and the unlucky fifteen applicants
for the offices, to which they claim to bo
rightfully entitled by reason of their
passing the civil service examination, are
whistling for their Jobs.
To the County Clerk is delegated the
power of swearing in the appointees, but
as their names were not handed to tho
Auditor by Collector Scott they cannot
be placed on the salary list.
During the absence of the Tax Collector
the curious ones are asking who Is In
charge of his office. The Mayor would
doubtless like much to know who has the
authority to sign Collector Scott's name,
so that the proper steps may be taken to
elevate the executive's partisans Into of
fice. The supposition Is that B. I. Salo
mon Is the deputy in charge of the tax of
fflce; Morris Levy, chiet deputy in tho
license office, and Oscar Curtaz, a brother
in-law of Collector Scott, acting cashier.
Four of the clerks who took tho exami
nation for deputyships accepted clerkship*
instead, though at a smaller salary. These
are James Citron. 1507 Masonic avenue;
Frederick H. Stahle, 64 Oak street: Frank
R. Smith. 22S9 Howard street, and James
B. Cowden, 2098 Green sfset.
Among the friends of the Mayor singled
out for especial favoritism are Edwin B.
Trlpp, who was formerly with Baldwin &.
Howell, and who passed the civil servlco
examination, with the rank of sixth, soon
after Police Commissioner Howell joined
the Police Commission. Another particu
lar favorite of the Mayor, who stood sec
ond In the competitive list of the deputies.
Is Oscar L. Tuttle, who was a former Au
ditor of Santa Cruz County, and who Is
said to have once .been employed In Maypr
Phelan's bank in San Jose. Both of these
aspirants are said to have been tempo
rarily promised places in Assessor Dodge's
office, or until such time as Collector Scott
returns from Tahiti, which is expected to
be about March 10.
While Collector Scott Is away the point
Is being: raised that the records as con
ducted by the old clerks are not legral,
thus suggesting; numerous complications
from that standpoint.

Judge Dunne haa granted the motion for
a new trial for Louis Parent!, the Mont
gomery-avenue tailor, who was recently
convicted on the charge of having re
ceived stolen goods trim William Thomp
son, .a teamster. When Parentl was ->n
trial, Daniel Callaghan, a friend,, ap
proached two Jurors and asked them to
deal leniently with the accused. They re
ported the matter to the court and Cal
laghan was sent to Jail for five days tor
contempt of court. . In granting the new
trial Judge Dunne said that he believed
Callaghan's actions Influenced the Jury
against the accused and hence he was en
titled to a new trial.

Tbcre % is much Interest in California at
present* over the preservation of the great
forest reserves of the State. The citizens
of the Etate are taking more Interest each
year In the National parks that have been
established by Congress and in the work
of protecting- them from depredations.
The most important of these' preserves
is the Yosemite National Park, and, that
this might be properly protected each
year, the Secretary of the Interior details
two troops of cavalry as a patrol for the
great park to protect It against fires and
against sheep men. These troops are in
charge of a senior officer of some rank,
who becomes acting superintendent of the
park. Last year Major L. H. Ruckcr of
the Sixth Cavalry was detaJled for this
duty with two troops of hia regiment, and
he established a park patrol that was the
most complete ever made in the park. He
protected the game on the preserve and
initiated several plfeees of trail and bridge
work that will be of great benefit tb trav
elers through this region. So excellent
was his work that a move is being made
to have the Federal Government again
send Major Ruckcr to the park, upon the
ground that the management of> the park
fihould be as nearly permanent as possible,
to secure the best results.

cisco. Detroit, Mich. Depository, Pacific Na-
tional Bank, Tacoma.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. U. 1901.
To the Stockholders:
It is the Intention of the management to Is-
sue from time to time, as the progress of our
mines warrant, reports on matters pertaining
to the company.
COPPER PROPERTIES.
Xlirht and day shifts arr at work extending
the 100-foot tunnel of the Tacoma mine. Very
complete houses have been built and three
months' previsions for the force at work have
been taken up. We are thus amply safeguarded
egalnet the spring and late winter snows llkely
to be encountered. The ore removed on this
work is being classified Into first and second
cUbe on the dump. On the. Blue Star one shift
of men are at work erectins buildings and do-
ing Eir-.ilar work preparatory to taking out or*
from tie Peacock Blue Vein. The trail to the
Chicago Group iv now nearly completed. Devel-
opment work on this group will not be com-
menced until about April 1st.
COAL LEASES.
After several month* of negotiations we have
succeeded in securing a 20-year leane of a very
, valuable tract of coal land. located near Fair-
fax, making, with the 160 acres previously
leased, 1SP0 acre3 thus acquired. This acqui-
sition gives us four mile?, linear, of the 12 veins
of coal fcund on the original lease. This lease
is obtained In conjunction with the Washington
Co-operative Mining Syndicate, an arrangement
greatly to our advantage. We thus are enabled
to double our available capital, en the co-opera-
tive idea, while in many cases the expense o:
operation i* halved. Work on the coal is now
being prosecuted with 30 men. and this num-
ber will be Increased as rapidly as development
will permit. Careful estimates made by our
regular engineer enable us to say that there Is
coal enough on this property to allow the min-
ing of 5000 tons per day for 100 years. This coal
Is confessedly the best cooking; and steaming
coal produced on the coast. At the present time
, the demand for It Is so great that If we were
producing at full capacity we could not supply
one-half of the present requirement of the mar-
ket. Our engineer estimates, at present prices,
the net pronts at fl.OD per ton for coal nnd SI. 50
per ton for coke. We have recently ordered 2$
Improved coke overs. Our Meamlng coal will
be on the marVet In 90 day* from date hereof.
IMPROVEMENTS.
The development on the coal property is be-
ing prosecuted with great energy. The flume
for furnishing the power for operating the saw.
mill, dynamos, light plant, etc.. Is completed
and In operation. The sawmill has been shipped
and will be In operation by March next. The
n-aron rotid. from thÂ« main workings to th*
railroad at Fairfax. I^i miles. Is now completeu.
We shall be shipping coal by May next.
DIVIDENDS.
We expect to be able to announce, August 1
prox.. a dividend payable October 1. 1901. De-
velopments to date fully warrant this announce-
ment. C. W. THOMPSON. Pr-s.
The Montezutra has the brightest prospect of
any mining company on the coast. It will
make more money for Its stockholders than any
other company. Its copper and coal properties
an- unequaled, as development daily proves.
More money is needed to push development.
That is why stock (par value SI) Is sold until
March 1st at Tc cash or Re on installments. At
this price it is a great bargain. Call cr send
for prospectus.

The Financier says: The changes in the
New York bank statement for the current week
are not so etriklns as those which have been
noted for a month or bo previous, although
the exhibit Is Important in Its revelation of
a pcÂ«slble consummation of the Important
financial operations that have, distinguished
the opening months of the current year. .The
scheme in fact covers only four days of the
Stock Exchange week, as Friday and Satur
day were observed as holidays. The known
movements of money coincide rather clcs;ly
with the totals of averages announced Satur
day, specie having exronded $1.41S,f.OO. while
legal* decreased $260,100. Thi?. accompanied by
a decrea^ of over two millions in deposits,
resulted in a gain of $1,694,125 in the surplus
reserve, bringing that item up to $14,540,675.
The falling off In deposits and In loans mark
the first decreases that have been noted this
year and are due probably to liquidation that
has" been characteristic or stock market opera
tions of latf. It cannot bs assumed, however,
that ths statement will continue to show only
unimportant fluctuations, for pending deals of
magnitude may rx.cn- A dec-idsd influence in the
near future. The i>ofcitlon of the banks, in
view of v.-Iiat has occurred lately, con only
be described aÂ« strong-. The season of heavy
remittances from tha interior, if past experi
ence is a pafe guide, is over for thi present.
The early spring months are usually marked
by a decided decrsa*^ in the cash resources
of the banKs. But for all that tlie Immediate
future, baaed 011 normal conditions, does not
indicate hlslier monay rates. /Cf course if the
banks are put to the btraln of financing heavy
trust plans predictions as to money rates must
be regarded aa theoretical, but the success of
pending scheme Â¦ will be assisted by a not
over tirm marltet and to that, extent at least,
it is safe to say. no Ktrinsency Is probable.
The loan and deposit Items of the clearing
house institutions have been enormously in
flated since early In January, but despite the
expansion of liabilities the surplus reserve is
within seven millions as high as a year ago.
this, too, in the face of an increase of one
hundred and twenty-two millions of deposits
and one hundred and Jlxty-slx millions of loans

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
WASHINGTON. Feb. 23.â Several mem
bers of the California delegation, with
Mrs. Lovell White and Mrs. A. D. Sharon,
held a conference with Mr. "Whiteside,
owner of the CaJaveras big trees, and his
counsel. ex-Senator Towne of Minnesota,
at the Capitol to-day with a view toward
reaching an understanding regarding the
price at which Whiteside would sell the
property to the Government. The entire
matter involved in the big tree bill now
proposed for enactment was discussed, but
without arranging a definite conclusion.
Another conference will be held at the
office of the Secretary of the Interior
Monday next, which it is hoped will pro
duce results favorable to the speedy con
sideration of the measure, if Speaker Hen
derson's objections to it can be overcome.
DISCUSS THE PRICE
OF BIG-TREE GROVE
WASHINGTON', B.â Severely as
Representative W. P. Hepburn of Iowa
criticized the officer* of the army he is
making a determined effort to Induce the
President to retain his son In the military
service as their a^feoclate. Yo.nB Mr.
Hepburn Is captain of volunteers in the
Signal Corps and is stationed In Puerto
Principe, Cuba.
"Whatever there is of criticism with re
g&r& to so-called upstarts." 1 said Hepburn
in the House yesterday, speaking of th*
officers of the army, "in my judgment
has its foundation, its Inception, in this
thing we call hazing at the academics.
That Is the starting point; that is where
the boy first gets his idea of superiority.
There is where he lim attempts its un
lawful and unjust exercise on other peo
ple."
Hepburn paid other harsh things about
army officers and attacked officers of the
navy. Faying he had in his pocket a list
of twenty-five naval vessels that had
either been cast away or run upon rocks
or shoals, and that the severest punish
ment imposed upon any of the command
ers of these ships was three years' eus
pension with short p*y.
Hepburn's statements are resented by
both army and navy officers. In Congres
sional circles it is recalled that Hepburn
was responsible for the action of the Mil
itary Committee in increasing the Signal
Corps, and lt is charged that this "hold
up" was for the benefit of his own son.
It is known that Hepburn, immediately
after the inclusion of the provision in th.3
army reorganization law. telegraphed his
son and took steps for securing his reten
tion in the service after the discharge of
volunteers now holding commissions.
Hepburn's attack on the military and
naval services is r*c:arded as especially
unfortunate at this time, as he is in
t harge of the revenue cutter reorganiza
tion bill, which is tÂ« be considered by the
House immediately after the appropria
tion bills are out. of the way.
It Is said that there are other members
of Congress who have venomously at
tacked the army and military academy
who are energetically trying to obtain ap
pointments for relatives.

"The California raisin situation on the Epot

favor.
"Currants are more active and larger orders
are said to bÂ« coming to local hcfliW?. but trade
is as yet of no very large proportions. Foreign
markets are reported firm. Prime evaporated
apples showed a considerable slump and at the
clo>=e there were free offerings of goods at 4 1 jc,
with no bids. Grenoble walnuts are in better
request."
"The increase of demand for prunes was the
feature in the driea fruit market lust week and
the aggregate business done was considerable,
although sales as a rule continued almost ex
clusively of small, or at least moderate-sized
lots, and at very low quotations. There was
some inquiry during the week for five and ten
car lots on about a 2o basis, but holders, so
far as could be learned, declined to consider
business p.t that level.

TTASHTNGTON'. Feb. 23.â The Senate
Committee on Relations with Cuba met
to-day to consider a proposed amendment
to the army appropriation bill providing
for the disposition of Cuban affairs. The
proposition -was prepared by the Repub
lican members of the committee and is
said to be satisfactory to most of them.
ThÂ« proposed amendment recites the so
called Teller amendment to the Spanish
Tvar resolution, and then gives ths Presi
dent authority to withdraw the troops
from Cuba when in hi9 judgment the pro
visions of the Teller amendment are real
ized.
The propositions embodied include the
following points:
That the T'nited States fhall have su
pervision of all treaties with foreign
countries made by the republic of Cuba.
That Cuba phall not undertake to pay
the debt incurred by Spain in her war
with Cuba prior to or after the interven
tion of the United States.
That Cuba shall apree either to lease or
sell to the United States such coaling and
naval stations as in the opinion of the
President of the United States may be
necessary to the protection of the inter
ests' of this country.
That the United States shall have suf
ficient supervision of the laws ot Cuba re
lating to sanitation to protect this coun
try from epidemics liable to originate
there.
It is understood that a draft of the con
stitution containing these provisions was
submitted to the President and the Secre
tary of War and that they expressed ap
pioval of them. The minority members of
the committee expressed themselves as
willing to come to an understanding on
these general line*. They insist, how
ever, upon many verbal amendments.
Another meeting: will likely be held on
Monday.
Provides That Cuba Shall Sell or
I/eaae Such Coaling Stations as
President May Deem
Necessary.
Republican Members Agree
on Amendment to the
Army Bill.

MRS. JOSEPH BECK of Dawson
City. N. \y. T.. is registered at
the Golden' West Hotel. A few
years ago Mrs. Beck was ,a
dressmaker In this city. Now
fhe has wealth running into the millions,
jn the fall of 1SS7 Mrs. Beck, then Mrs.
XoTfcU, a widow, left San Francisco to
i^ : ek fortune in. the frozen gold fields of
the far north. Her friends all told her
t!vat she was a thorough business woman,
:,nd that she was bound to make a sue
cf ss of her venture.
On arriving at Dawson City Mrs.
Nowell decided to earn a living as either
b. dressmaker or milliner, but Joseph
Keck, a mining man. was in quest of a
bookkeeper and she secured the position.
She paid such dose attention to business
that her employer decided that he had
found .a woman who would make not only
a loving wife but a splendid partner. They
Â« ame down from Nome in the fall of 1898
and were married in this city. With good
luck and judicious investments in mines
ilr. Beck to-day ie looked upon as one of
ihÂ« richest of Dawson'E citizens. He
Â«rlginally owned the Old Dominion claim,
which 'he sold at an enormous price. At
present Mr. and Mrs. Beck own claim
No. 11 on Gold Run. The latter claim has
not been worked, but they have been
offered SM.OOO for the short strip cf land.
Mrs. Be-ck paid yesterday that she leaves
<o-morrow for Dawson to see her hus-
ISnVt* h< ; r , a 2 n ' -Walter S. Novell. She \
EiLi* 1^ eX^ hs & t' White Horse and !
to *. tile metropolis of the frozen
"Â°"5'* distance of over 400 miles, in the
severest season of the year.
Â«.nt . ex P e Â«s great things from the pres
ent mine .that she and her husband own.
Jhe next claim to It worked *40.C>00 In four
days last season.
With her sudden affluence Mrs. Beck
has her every wish gratified.. Her present
trip down from Dawson was to buy a
country place for her husband and her
seir, who intend selling: out in about two
ars o* and a Â£ aln Scorning residents of
this State. Recently Mrs. Beck bought
Ri la^ e k^ 1 5f, i and - 7m acres - at RÂ«d
Bluff, which will be conducted as a Btock
r t ns^* a . lar ee number of cattle having
already been bought. On the return off
the Becks to California they will occupy j
a palatial residence that is at present in
course of construction at Red Bluff
Mrs. Beck has over S2000 worth of gold
nuggets made into necklaces and brace
lets as souvenirs f\cm the Old Dominion
claim. 1

During the past week tho long stand
ing differences between the mill owners
and mill workers have been amicably ad-
Justed and an agreement reached, which.
It Is hoped, will prevent any recurrence of
the trouble. But while, the millmen's
strike is over the teamsters are at outs
with their employers over the question ot
wages, hours and the boarding camps, and
unless the quarrel is patched up there is
liable to be a big tie-up of business, espe
cially In the building and mercantile lines.
In this city. ,
A fight is also on between Schussler
Bros, and the-' picture frame workers
lately employed at their place of business.
At the meeting of the Labor Council on
Friday night that body declared Its in
tention of levying a boycott against the
firm unless it recedes from its stand in
lecking out union hands.
I The barbers, having succeeded in gain-
Ing State legislative recognition, are mak
ing great plans for the future. Governor
Gage has conditionally promised to . ap
point J. J. Callsh and A. E. Wray of this
city as two of the Board of Examiners
and assured the union that San Fran
cisco shall be the headquarters of; the.
board.
The Hackmen's Union desires to correct
a mistake that has been published, to the
effect that It would, boycott all under
takers who would send funerals' to ceme
teries on steam or railroad cars. "What
the Hackmen's Union will try to do is to
have the members of the union patronize
hacks in preference to other means of
conveyance at the funeral of a member
or of any of his family.-
A schedule of wages drawn up by the
members, of Milkmen's Union provides
that wages shall be not less than $40 per
month with board, and $60 where no board
is provided. Twelve hours is to constitute
a day's work, and all overtime is to be
paid for at the rate of 40 cents an hour.
A communication was received from
August Iten, secretary of the Milkers'
Union of California, requesting the union
to send delegates to a convention of pro
vision trades, the purpose of which is to
organize a group of trades unions into a
sub-council, the said group being -.those
that depend largely for their success on
showcards, union labels, stamps, etc,,. ,.
It was resolved : to send a full . delega
tion and to assist the project in every
posssible way. R. Grosse, T: Tuite,: Ch.
Cantert and 'A. - R. : Andre were' elected

MAY BUCKLEY GOES
BACK. TO NEW YORK
She Plays Star Part in "The Price of
Peace,". Litt's N"ew
The theater-goers ot San Francisco will
regret to learn that they will miss the
pleasure of seeing Miss May Buckley, the
clever young actress who recently arrived
in this city from Nevr York to play a short
engagement at the Alcazar.
At the close of Miss Buckley's' season

at the Alcazar. It was arranged that
Miss Buckley should appear here in some
of her great successes, including "The
First Born" and "Hearts Are Trumps."
She arrived here the early part of the
week and was rehearsing with the com
pany for her appearance. Yesterday
Manager . Utt wired Miss Buckley that
she must return to New York at once and
rehearse for the star part In "The Price
of Peace." ,
Miss Buckley said, last evening that
though she was pleased that . Manager
Lltt had selected her for the star role she
was sorry that she had to return so soon
to New York. Miss Buckley has a host
of friends in this city and she had planned
to renew all old acquaintances. She said
that she would conn?, out at the close of
her present season and then try to ful
fill her broken engagement.

the meeting to be held on March 4 the
roll will be closed. The union is strong
and determined to carry out the principles

Sjwc'.al Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
EL PASO. Tex., Feb. 23.â A tremendous
social sensation has been raging In the
city of Chihuahua, Mexico, by reason of
the kidnaping there of a remarkably
beautiful young actress only 15 years of
age, who. had been filling an engagement
as leading lady with the "Companla In
fantil," a high class performance. The
girl. Columba Quintana, though young in
years was weil developed and possessed
of all the charms of a typical Spanish
maiden. The young men of the town were
enraptured and she played to crowded
houses.
A dispatch received from Chihuahua to
ony states that the girl mysterious
ly disappeared last Monday and all ef
forts to locrte her proved "utterly futile'
until yesterday, when It was discovered
tr.at she had been, kidnaped by a noto
rious divekeeper and was being held a
close prisoner at a house In an unfre
quented neighborhood in -the outskirts of
the city. Juana Taola, a notorious wo
man procuress, who has deliberately
sought the downfall of many Chihuahua
maidens and has succeeded In more than
one Instance, was llrst suspected by the
police of kidnaping Senorita Columba
Quintana. ahd when accused boldly ad
mitted that she knew the whereabouts of
the etrl, but refused to disclose it to the
authorities.
The procuress was arrested and after
twenty-four hours in jail agreed to direct
the oitlcers to the ; house where the girl
v:as being 'held a prisorjer on the. condi
tion that they would liberate her. This
they agreed to do because of the pressure
brought to bear by the friends of the
missing actress, who were extremely anx
ious to .rescue her before serious harm
had befallen her. The girl was finally lo
cated and rescued. She> was almost pros
t'.ated with fear when found, but had not
been harmed. Â¦ Jt was evidently the In
tention of JuanaTapia to hold the girl
until the opera company had .left the state
and the affair had blown over.
Held Captivo in an Unfrer
r ; quented Part of City of
Chihuahua.
