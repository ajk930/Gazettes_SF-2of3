There were nineteen British battleships,
eleven cruisers -and eight gunboats, not
even the full strength of the channal
squadron. Eight' naval -embassadors of
friendly . powers Â¦ were ranged along the
Portsmouth end, while gunboats ; and
steamers .with official spectators formed
the remainder of the southern line. The

Three special . trains took down the
members of the House of Lords and of

was sprinkled over, the green fields under
a glistening sun, whose rays were Bifted

half-masted Union Jacks were hung from
many buildings * In the town along the
road. A great royal standard dropped
from the staff above. the ancient tower of

The pageant was witnessed by thou
sands of persons afloat and ashore. The
Alberta entered the harbor at 4:40 p. m.,
and at once moved alongside the land

GREAT FLEET
SALUTES THE
CATAFALQUE
The light oak of the coffin shone out as
the sailors grasped thÂ© handles. \ Tho
ycrting Crown Prince of Germany could
scarcely keep his hand at the Balute for
emotion. With perfect precision the coffin
was lifted off the gun carriage on board
the royal yacht Alberta, Once more the
Grenadiers camo to the "present" as tho
King, followed by the relatives, stepped
down the gangway and regalia and robes
were replaced on the coffin.
The King was tired from the walk. The
equerries removed the. regalia, the royal
ties still standing at' salute, while behind
them the Princesses bowed, their heads,
visibly fatigued.
A second later the ,Klng and the Em
peror and their suites appeared. As the
carriage stopped before the gangway of
the Alberta loud orders rang out, a sharp
movement ran through the stalwart line
of Grenadiers, their arms were instantly
reversed up to their hats and with equal
precision came the hands of the Emperor,
King and the Duke of Connaught in state
ly salute. :. â¢ - '-S^-ii.
After leaving Osborne House the mourn
ing procession of Kings and Princes ar
rived near the pier without incident." Ths
strains of 'Chopin's funeral march gave
warning to the naval officers on the pier
that the coffin was drawing near.- 'The
surrounding quays were black .with , ex
pectant thousands. Through the court
archway came the few staff officers, then
the Highlanders, their pipes silent and all
heads bared. Eight bronzed and bearded
tars were â¢ drawn up waiting to receive
their burden. .Then came the Grenadiers,
resplendent in their busbies and . scarlet
and quickly formed a circle around the
court. The 'artillery horses were restless
from their long walk and pranced under
the gateway, drawing the gun carriage
with tho coffin.
The roadway from the gate to the pier
was lined with troops in close order; the
troops remained in position until the min
ute guns from the fleet commenced to fire.
Thousands stood bareheaded and watched
tho strange sight. . , * -

ty's household: the household of the
King, the household of the Queen, the

ants.'
Down hill the procession slowly wound
its way In the following order: Mounted
grooms: the deputy assistant adjutant
general of the Southern District: a de
tachment of the Hampshire Carbineers;
the Lieutenant-Governor of tho Isle of
Wight and staff of the Southern District;
the staff of the commander In chief at
Portsmouth; the general commanding the
Southern District: the naval commander
in chief; massed bands and drums of the
Royal Marine "Artillery and of the Royal
Marine Light Infantry, who played a fun

Queen'B gate: the'. Queen's Highlanders:
the Queen's pipers; the gun carriaga,
drawn by eight horses and preceded and
followed by her late. Majesty's equerriea

Louise (Dnchess of Argyll), Princess Beat
rice (Princess Henry ' of Battenberg), the'
Duchess of Â¦ Connaught, _the Duchess of
ing of the laet and best of them. As they
reached the Queen's gate and wailed their
closing strain, the muffled drums rolled
out with oft-recurring rhyming beats and
the bands burst forth Into the magnifi
cent strains of Chopin'a "Funeral March."
Off went every hat, every woman court
esled low, the troops leversed arms and
leaned their bowed heads, over them, still
as statues. Down hill went the sad pro
cession, through the still and silent ranks
of the people. No sound but that of the
mournful march could be heard; but that
was re-echoed far away to the spectators
on the neighboring hills and to, the ships
far out at sea.
The pipers had followed the first dirge
by the touching lament", "The Flowers of
the Forest," which represents the wither-
The mounted grooms who headed the
line wore bright scarlet. With the massed
bands were no fewer than forty muffled
drums. Among the Highlanders were
seven Queen's Foresters, following whom
pipers wailed the sad music of the. Black
Watch's dirge. The King, Emperor Wil
liam and the Duke of Connaught walke-.l
abreast, followed by the Princes. They
stepped slowly and mournfully, a sad
looking group in spite of the brilliancy of
their uniforms.
At 1:43 a. m. sailors from the Victoria
and Albert raised the precious burden an-1
bore it from the house. This duty was to
have fallen to tho Highlanders, but at the
rehearsal they were bo awkward that it
was decided that the sailors should per
form the task. Outside tho royal resi
dence Grenadier Guards were.drawn up on
a brilliant line. With a sharp click they
presented arms, for the last time, in honor
of their dead Queen. The pipers led the
procession, making the woods ring Â¦with
a weird refrain. Behind them came th6
royal family. At the gate the military
portion of theparade stood ready, a glit
tering medley of uniforms.
robed women followed the heads of the
Royal Household, In gorgeous uniforms.
The coffin was placed upon the gun-car
riage. The pipers commenced their dirge
At 1:30 p. m. the bars of the main door
of Osborne House creaked and the petty
officers of the royal yacht Victoria and
Albert then doffed their hats and entered.
King Edward came from a side entrance,
accompanied by Emperor William of Ger
many. They both Wore admiral's unl
t->rms. The Grenadiers momentarily
raised their heads and came to the salute,
which the King returned, and the men
agait. became mute figures. ' r v* ; r r
Th'er. through the glass door ' could be
seen tht cofnn coming, carried by the sail
ors who but a few moments previous had
entered, it was preceded by pipers and
was covertd with the royal robes and re
galia and accompanied on either side by
equerries. Immediately behind the King
took his place tn the right of the Emperor
of Germany. T\e King's head was bowed.
The Emperor wvs' erect, his face expres
sionless. Then followed tho royal princes.
A few seconds latet emerged Queen Alex

and dressed In tha "timplest black, their
faces entirely veiled vith crape, Several
of the party, and especially. Princess
Beatrice, were Bobbing^bitterly,

From the castle moat to the pier troops
stood with elbows touching. Behind them
were thousands of men, women and chil
dren. The road was lined with poles with
shields of black and silver upon them
bearing the royal monogram or surround
ed with flags. Stands for spectators
dotted the route. Innumerable' cameras
were posted at advantageous spots.
Hawkers were busy disposing of black
bordered memorial cards and other souve
nirs. Equerries, alds-de-camp, mounted
grooms .and messengers dashed hither and
thither, seeing that everything was. In
readiness. The guard around Osborne
House was most rigid, and besides the po
lice a long, thin line of red merged Into
the green and brown woods clustering
around the royal residences. The Queen s
Guard was drawn up in double rank be
fore the Queen's entrance, with heads
bowed over their arms, as In the death
chamber.
COWES, Feb. 1.â Cowes was astir at
dawn and quickly became alive with vis
itors. Every stand, window and roof
whence ths procession could be viewed
was rapidly filled up, while the portion
of the route open to spectators was soon
Impassable. Long before- the hour for
the funeral the hilly York avenue leading
from Osborne was a picturesque sight,

The dominant note In the whole scene
was Its grand simplicity, and. so far as hu

by some hidden power. No Incident of.
any kind occurred -to mar Its stately

Shortly before 3 o'clock white smoke
broke from the Majestic's side and a Bec
ond later a report, cracked over the har
bor and ecnoed to the hills, announcing
the starting of the Alberta from Trinity
pier. From ship to ship the salute was
passed down the line.. Each vessel of the
fleet was â¢ firing . minute guns. They all
employed their shore side batteries, so
that on the channel sides were silhouettes
of hulls, spars and iron work, before
backgrounds of dense . gray smoke. The
sound was that of a great battle. The
funeral fleet was just well under way
when it cam^ abreast J of the press boat.
Torpedo-boat destroyers^ crept ahead,
moving : ln< pairs, like silent pallbearers
marching before a hearse. They were the

Through the whole length of thÂ« chan

dashing amons them. For nearly three
hours the fleet watched for the coming of
the funeral. The officers on the bridges.
In- the most gorgeous uniforms, with all
their decorations and medals, scanned the
Cowes shore docks through their glasses.
An occasional brilliant burst of sunshine
showed tens of thousands of spectators,
subjects of the dead. Queen, assembled to
witness her last passage from Cowes to
Portsmouth.
"Queen's weather" came at noon In a
burst of sunshine and the clouds cleared
away from the channel and lingered
above the tree % tops along the crest of hills
on either side. The police boat' ushered
the merchant shipping Â¦ and crowded ex
cursion craft back , to their anchorages
under the shelter of the shore. â¢ :C"
The pathway between the ships was a
quarter of' a milÂ© avenue of clear water.
Behind the lines of the warships hovered
a few yachts- and channel steamers. Black
torpedo boats and torpedo-boat destroyers
were . skirmishing about and offices* gigs
and launches swarmed everywhere. Bugle
calls came over the water and gaudy sig
nal flags burst out and disappeared. The
British ships were also lighted with
gleams of the scarlet coats of the marine*.

such ruling would lack validity. Speaker

There was a voll call, followed by' a call
of the house, and the clerks took ten min
utes to figure out the result, whtle John
son was scurrying about trying to squeeze
out a few more affirmative votes. One
member changed from no to aye, and
Walker of Santa Clara promptly changed
from aye to no. The Speaker, Johnson
and the clerks gave up in despair, and
Pendleton announced the vote 50 to 27 and
declared the mction lost, as it had not re
ceived the necessary two-thirds majority.
Melick offered a resolution striking out
section 2 of bill 558, which makes it a
felony to write or print any reportof
Asiatic cholera or bubonic plague until
the State Board - of Health has declared
it to exist and such declaration has been
entered in its minutes.
"I may be talking against a stone wall,"
said Mellck, "In view of certain commu
nications and certain demands made upon
members here, but I hope this amendment
will be accepted. This section, strikes at
the very root of the freedom of speech
and of the press. Moreover, it will 1 be in
effective, because we cannot control pub
lications outside the State, where the real
commercial - Injury is inflicted in such
cases."
James favored the amendment. He said
the objectionable section . absoultely re
versed the rules and regulations of every
local Board of Health, making a felony
of what Is now Its duty.
Cowan made the point that a physician
was liable now to lose his license 'to prac
tice for failure to report a case of, con
tagious disease. If this bill became a law
ho would be guilty of a felony if he did.
, "This bill," Laird said, "goes much far
ther than the severest legislation we have.
San Francisco might have the plague on
every street, yet if one man warned an
other away he would be guilty of felony.
And If. thÂ© State Board of .Health should
refuse to act or to enter Kg decision m

MENTO. Feb. 1.â Assembly bills
558, 559 and 5G0, introduced by
Speaker Pendleton in pursuance of
the policy of Governor Gage to
ward the commission sent out by the
Treasury Department to investigate
health conditions, were the cause of the
most bitter fight this morning that has
yet taken place in the. Assembly during
this session. For almost three hours
Johnson, with the majority of the mem
bers behind him, fought to rush the bills
through as < urgency measures, with
James, Cowan, Brown of San Mateo and
others seeking to have the bills take the
regular course, at least to the extent of
reference to committees.
Johnson himself made the concession of
allowing the first bill, 658, to go to the
Judiciary Committee, to be reported on
Monday and made a special order for
Tuesday. This concession was made by
Johnson because he was forced to confess
to Laird that the clause in section 2 of the
bill, which makes the writing or printing
of an assertion even that Asiatic cholera
or bubonic plague "has recently existed"
a. felony, was unconstitutional.
The other billsâ 659, making it the duty
of local boards of health to report sus
pected cases of the cholera or plague to
the State Board of Health, and empow
ering the latter to. take possession of tne
body of a living or the corpse of a" de
ceased person .which has had - such dis
ease, and 560, appropriating $100,000 for the
investigation of . health affairsâ were
finally forced through to a. special order
for to-morrow morning immediately after
the reading of the journal.
The consideration of the bills, all on the
file as special x order, was deferred to .11
o'clock, as the bills were not on the mem
bers' desks. Shortly before 11 o'clock
James opened the contest by offering a
resolution authorizing the appointment r>y
the Speaker of a committee of live to in
vestigate and report to the Assembly
whether or not plague had existed in Cali
fornia. He claimed that members could
not vote Intelligently on the bills proposed
until they had 'personal knowledge of the
facts around which the controversy be
tween the Federal quarantine service and
(he local officials had raged. Schleslnger
and Cowan spoke. In favor of the resolu
tion, but on motion of Knight the resolu
tion was tabled.
Johnson offered a resolution declaring
the measures urgency bills and providing
that they fhould be given the second ana
third readings immediately. A long par
liamentary contest 1 ensued. In the course
of which Mellck and the Speaker clashed
The Speaker had ordered members to
their seats, with a very evident direction
of his command at. Mellck. Later Mellck
demanded that members who were work-
Ing among the Assemblymen in the Inter
ests of Pendleton's bills be treated in the
same manner. â¢ ,
"I do not remember," said the Speaker,
'to have addressed any ruling to you, and
your remarks are entirely Â¦ uncalled for
and irregular.',' Â¦ â¢
The Incident passed, but after the ad
journment the two men had some words
that started the rumor about the^Capitol
that they had come to blows.-
Johnson's resolution to declare the bills

"That was my opinion then." he con
cluded, "and that Is my opinion now."
Hills disclaimed any prejudice against
the California commission, and denied
that he had written one word about the
Paris Exposition, except what had been
published over his own signature, except
a recent editorial in the Record-Union, in
which he decried the effort to make the
controversy a personal one between him
and the Commissioners.
James A. Filcher, manager of the State
Board of Trade, told how the Hamburg
exhibit, which was nearly as large and
quite as good, in his opinion, as the State
exhibit at Paris, cost the State but $3350.
He reiterated -a great deal that Mills had
said.
Joseph D. Lynch of the Western
Graphic was sworn. He said he had writ
ten the editorials which had appeared in
the Graphic and had based them upon in
formation he had received from letters
Truman had written to him. He submitted
some of these letters and they were re
ceived by the committee. The principal
one contained lists or questions submitted
to Gasklll. Footeanu Runyon. These the
committee has decided, not to make public.
Â¦ Lynch was the only witness so far ex
amined who has had a good word to say
for Truman. -. .â¢â¢
Mr. Foote has been very ill with a se
vere cold. He left for his home this
afternoon. â¢ :'Â¦ 'â¢ ;.-â¢

and California a State.
Mills was then asked how the Southern
Pacific exhibit compared with that of
California, and he said there could have
been no comparison. The Southern Pa
cific's exhibit was larger and more com
plete and covered everything the State
exhibit covered and more. too. Â¦
. "We showed everything the State pro
duces," said Mr. Mills, "whether the arti
cles be produced in commercial quantities
or not. This was done not only to show
the existing conditions.. but the possibili
ties of the State." ; . * .
, Mills was asked what wa# the cost of
the Southern Pacific's exhibit, and he said
the total expense amounted to $32,000, and
in this was included $7000 f on office "Tents,
$1000 for furnishings and fittings, $4000 for'
a pavilion. $2000 for duty, $2000 for-installa
tion and $5600 for collection. The Califor
nia exhibit, he said, should not have cost
more than $10,000, ,'wlth 13600 more to in
stall it.
The questions then turned upon head
quarters, and Mills was asked what he
thought of the advisability of having
headquarters at all. He said Fuch a plan
was a good one,, for, while the exhibit
was for visitors, an office was a place to
which merchants couid be Invited and
there informed of the commercial possi
bilities of the State.
"Did you have any wine there?" asked
Treadwell. Â«
"Yes," replied Mills; "we brought 2000Â»
bottles of wine to Paris,' but from thi3 we
had to take enough for an exhibit"
"Did you serve this to visitors?" s
"Yes, we served samples of wine to deal
ers and those who showed they were fam
iliar with the sampling of wine. We pre
ferred discussing the wine as a product
rather than drinking it as a drink. 1 ' . .
"And did you make any special effort nt
entertainment?" .
"Nf| we preferred to put. the product*
of the State on exhibition, not the people
who were exhibiting them."
Then Mills was asked what he had' sold
his exhibit for and ho said what was sold
brought $3W0. it was sold to many deal
ers, not to one. He was asked what he
thought of $460 as a selling price for an
exhibit and he said that for such an ex
hibit as the commissioners m,ade $460 was
a very good price. He said, further, that
the State exhibit was poor in every de
partment except that of mining, the min
eral exhibit having been made up by the
State Mining Bureau.
Then Stewart was given an opportunity
to ask why Hills had not visited the.Cal-'
ifornia headquarters. Mills declined to
answer because he said it was a personal
matter, but when Sicwart Insisted on the
question Mills said that when the Com
missioners tried to prevent the good his
company intended to do for the State he
believed their . course was unwise, un
patriotic and contemptible and that was
why he did not so near the State head-
Special Dispatch to The Coll.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO. Feb. 1.â The inves
tigation into the affairs of the
Paris Commission opened this
afternoon with William H. Mills
on the stand. His testimony was
rosy and there was not- much that he
wiEhed to tell that he. did not get before
the committee. Among a great many
other things, he said he has seen exhibits
at the State fair in Sacramento that were
better than the exhibit of ' the v United
States at the World's Fair in Paris. 'He
declared that a collective exhibit, such
as was made, was of little value to the
State, and after saying that an exhibit
without seme one on hand to explain it
to visitors was practically withouHfcUue,
he went on to add that he never saw any
one connected with the exhibit anywhere
near it.
Mr. Mills helped out the commission by
saying he was in favor of establishing
headquarters, but when Filcher came to
the stand after Mills had been excused
and told how he had to give his card to
a colored boy before he was allowed to
enter, the headquarters question resumed
its former level. An earnest endeavor
was made by the committeemen to find
out what had engendered bitter feelings
Mills believed if the matter had been
properly handled this State could have
obtained a collective exhibit. Had the
Commissioners agreed to surrender all the
spaco allowed to California in return for
space for a collective exhibit, he thought
such a scheme might have gone through.
Treadwell wished to know if the collec
tive exhibit of the Southern Pacific was
allowed to compete fof prizes, and Mills
said it had not. Then Treadweir asked
If the California exhibit could have com
peted for prizes if a collective exhibit had
been made, and. Mills said he could not
tell, the cases not being parallelâ the
Southern Pacific was a commercial body
Mills was careful to make no charges
against the Commissioners, although he
hesitated not at all to cay their exhibit
was no eood and much j too costly. Ho
does not approve of the French Govern
ment, and said so, and told how Miglia
vacca, a wine man 'of Napa, had shown
him a blank form in which he was asked
to fill in the character of his exhibit, its
class, etc., percentage and the award he
wished it to have.
"I have relegated the whole business to
the mental vultures who revel in the car
rion of scandal," he said, and this seemed
to satisfy the committee. .
between Mills and the commission, and
Mills gave one reasonâ the row over the
exhibit of the Southern Pacificâ but when
he was pressed for more details he would
go no further.

ret tt will recommend for passage.
Sector Rowell defended his bills, es-.
tablishtng direct inheritance, naturaliza
tion an* Incorporation taxes, as against
the bills introduced by Senator Lukens
as the result of the conference between
Governor Gaga and the Alamedar County
delegation. Ssenator Smith of Kern stood
v.tth Dr. Rowell, but tha other members,
so far" as jopjnions were expressed, were
all of the opinion that if tiny aid were
to be given during thi3 session ; of the
Legislature it must be by such measures
as the Lukens bills, since they akma meet
the Governor's approval.
Senator Smith took the gfound that the
burden of higher education ought to bÂ«
borne by th*> classes able to avail them
selves of the luxury, of that education.
Those. classes vere reached by such taxes
as. those Imposed on direct Inheritance
and articles of incorporation.
Senator Leavltt said the Idea that a
biennial lobby for the university would
be made necessary If the policy of direct
appropriations were adopted was a mis
taken one. He agreed with the Governor
that experimenting with ' revenue meas
ures was not to be thought of in provid
ing for the university's support. No one
could give a reasonably accurate estimate
of what revenue the Rowell bills would
produce.
Senator Davis spoke In the same vein.
He said the inheritance tax might get a
revenue beyond the reasonable needs of
the university. On the other hand he
believed the tax on foreign corporations
would yield very little.
Both Davis and Lukens combated
Smith's Idea that a higher education was
a luxury to be enjoyed only by the well
to-do and wealthy, classes, contending
that Its advantages were enjoyed largely
by young men and women from the hum
ble walks of life and that in the uni
versities . more truly than elsewhere no
aristocracy of wealth existed.
The Finance Committee did not act
upon the State Agricultural Park bill.
Some members of the committee visited
the park to-day In company with friends
of the measure, but the bill was not con
sidered at the meeting.

SACRAMENTO. Feb. 1.â As a means of
facilitating- Its work, the Senate Finance
Jommlttee has decided to allot to various
sub-committees the task of Investigating
the needs of the State officers and insti
tutions whose Income Is supplied by the
general appropriation bill. The sub-com
mittees will work Independently, but their
conclusions will be. reviewed by the com
mittee as a whole before final action.
The general appropriation bill Is the
most Important financial measure at each
regular session of the Legislature. The
Controller's estimate for the next two
years Is $11,695,043. At Its last regular
session the Legislature appropriated Jll,
710,598 for the expenses of the State gov
ernment for the two fiscal years ending
July 1, 1901. No definite idea can yet be
gained as to the probable amount of the
general appropriation at the present ses

It would seem at first fiance that
catarrh, being a disease of the mucous
membrane, salves, sprays, etc., beinjr
applied directly to the membranes of th*
nose and throat would be the most ra-
tional treatment, but this has been proven
not to be true. . .- '
The mucous membrane Is made and re-
paired from the blood and catarrh la a
blood disease and any remedy to make at
permanent cure must act on the blootj,
and when the blood la purified from ca-%
tarrhal poison, the secretions from tBe
mucous membrane will 'become natural
and healthy.
In this climate thousands of people seem
scarcely ever free from sorna form of
catarrh; It gets better at times, but each
winter becomes) gradually deeper seated
and after a time the sufferer resigns him-
self to It as a necessary evil.
Catarrh cures are almost as numerous.

Inconvenient and ineffective s* to render
their use a nuisance nearly as annoying
as catarrh Itself; any one who has used

There are a number of excellent Internal

best and certainly the safest la a new

A leading drugrgist In Albany, apeakins

RENDER HONOR
TO LATE QUEEN
OF ENGLAND
In showy, fulldress array. The band of
each, took up a he funeral march when the
Alberta came abreast of her and the spec
tators on all the other craft took off their
hats. So, with all eyes focused on the
tiny looking purple bier, the remains of
Queen .Victoria were carried by."
Qver all the miles of waters there came
no sound save the boom of cannon and
the mournful notes of many bands.
Following the Alberta trailed along five
other yachts at regular intervals. First
was the Victoria and Albert, a royal
yacht, twice as large as the Alberta and
of similar design. She carried the royal
mourners, who, as relatives or officials,
followed the coffin. King Edward and
Emperor William were chief among them,
but from the observation boats they were
the only group not recognizable. A few
scarlet coats could be seen, with ladies in
the deepest mourning, and . on the upper
deck the Queen's Indian attendants were
distinguishable by their white turbans.
In the wake of the Victoria and Albert
Emperor William's yacht Hohenzollern
loomed up like an ocean greyhound, as
large as a : warship, painted a spotless
white. y,^.-r. 'Â¦
.' The other yachts came in single file
astern. The Osborne, larger than tho
Alberta and of the same class, came first.
Next was the Admiralty yacht Enchant
ress, smaller, and then a little ' Trintlty
House yacht. Finally came another ves
sel, a. black torpedo-boat destroyer.
Twenty "minutes after the first pair of
torpedo-boat destroyers came abreast* of
the press boat the nistorlc . parade had
passed and was dwindling smaller and
smaller toward the sunset, where tho
purple clouds and volumes of smoke made
an overpowerincly Impressive stage spec
tacle. The guns of each warship ceased
firing when the Alberta had gone by and
the ma.rines reversed arms. But they. and
all the crews remained at their stations,
while the fleet steamers from the shores,"
their decks solid masses of black, crowded
with thousands of the late. Queen's sub
jects, raised their anchors and followed
outside the line'of warships.
Gradually the din of the minute guns
lessened as the batteries of ship after ship
ceased firing, white. the funeral parade
swept around the end of the line and into
the entrance of Portsmouth harbor.
It was 5 o'clock when the echoes of the
last gun ceased. The Bun was a great
red globe sinking to the hilltops, the
clouds began to fall again on the channel
and the body of the Queen was safe in
Portsmouth harbor. ,
When the Alberta entered the harbor;
with the minute guns in the forts sound
ing, the bells of all the churches of the
city tolling, the ancient f rigato Victory,
moored there, fired a salute of muzzle
loaders. The marines manning her s.tood

Tho escorting torpedo-boat destroyers

the capitalists who acquired control of the
road for C. P. Huntington have sold their
large holdings of stock to the agents of
Vanderbilt and Harriman. No Immediate
change in the presidency of the Southern
Pacific is apprehended. It Is not' even
hinted that such a change Is in con
templation. The fact, however, presents
itself that the interests which elected Mr.
Hays to take charge of the Southern Pa
cific system no longer direct. the affairs
of the company.
Early yesterday morning, following The
Call's announcement of big deals In South
ern^ Pacific, Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. and
two prominent bankers of San Francisco
received private messages from New
York which told of large transactions in
the stock of the Southern Pacific. It was
noted also in the telegrams that Santa Fe
holdings were in demand at increased
prices. The- surprising intelligence con
tained in the early dispatches ,were sup
plemented by subsequent telegrams an
nouncing that Speyer & Co. had sold one
block of 450,000 shares of Southern Pacific
to a purchaser at Union Pacific headquar
ters. Other messages contained the defi
nite announcement that the Vanderbllt-
Harriman syndicate was the purchaser.
Later In the day Bolton, De Ruyter & Co.
received a telegram stating that James
Speyer when asked regarding the report
ed transaction replied: "We were offered
a satisfactory price for our Southern Pa
cific stock and acecpted it."
Along with the messages from Wall
street came telegrams from London to the
effect that 100,000 shares of Southern Pa
cific had just been purchased in that city.
. The simultaneous advance of Santa Fe
stock was not accounted for in San Fran
cisco until it was exuialned that Harri
man was largely Interested in the Santa
Fe, St. Paul and Northern Pacific rail
roads and had recently acquired in the
interest of his combination the ownership
of the American Steamship line from
Hamburg to New York. It appears there
fore that the Vanderbilts . and Harriman
now control both the Southern Paclflc and
Santa Fe systems, together with the
steamship line from. Hamburg to New
York, and the Pacific Mail line from San
Francisco to Hongkong. The syndicate has
not got the earth, but it has acquired a
through line from Hamburg to Hongkong,
which will give, it a great margin of ad
vantage in a contest for the carrying
trade between Europe, America and As.'a.
It Is well known to railroad men that
the Vanderbilt line from New York to San
Francisco will be the New York Central
and Lake Shore to Chicago, the Chicago
and Northwestern to Council Bluffs, the
Union Pacific to Ogden and the Central
lngton shares. It Is said they made an
offer for the entire block,, but the price
offered was unsatisfactory.
It was then, according to Wall-street
gossip, that the Harriman syndicate
stepped In, obtained an option on the
Huntington shares and named to the
Speyers the price they were willing to pay
all around.
The Southern Paclflc is said to have the
largest capitalization of any of the Amer
ican roads, its stock being capitalized at
$200,000,000. The properties concerned in
the deal directly and indirectly represent,
it is said, an investment of $500,000,000. The
Harriman syndicate is supposed to be di
vided into portions of one-eighth, E. II.
Harriman holding two of these and the
rest being distributed as follows:
J. P. Morgan and W. K. Vanderbilt, one
fourth; Rockfeller interests, one-eighth;
George Gould, one-eighth; 1 Kuhn.^Loeb &
Co., one- fourth.
The history of this transaction dates
back to shortly before the death of Collis
P. Huntington last summer. Mr. Hunt
ington, to whom overtures for the ac
quisition of his stock were made, declined
to sell. His heirs, however, were more
ready, but th'ey refused, as well as Mr.
Speyer, an offer of $45 a share, which the
syndicate made to them for the whole of
their holdings. It is understood that
they named a price somewhere around $50
a share as the only one they wmild con
sider. Such an offer was, it is said,
made, but It was not actually accepted
until to-day. H. E. Huntlngton, nephew
of the late C. P. Huntington, arrived
here to-day, but declined to talk.
James Speyer late to-night said:
"I received an offer for my holdings of
Southern Pacific stock and I have parted
with .them at the figure agreed upon."
"Will you state what the figure was, or
who was the purchaser?"
"No," said Mr. Speyer. ."That would
be contrary to my agreement with the
purchaser, who desired that both facts be
kept secret. No, I cannot state what was
the amount of ray holdings."
"Does this sale include or have anything
to do with the Huntington holdings?" .
"I am speaking altogether of my own
stock. Whatever may have been done in
regard to the Huntington holdings will
have to come from others. There is every
reason to believe, however, that some ar
rangement was made with regard to
them."

OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 1.â Edward Dick
inson, general manager of the Union Pa
cific Railway, said to-night that he had no
OIE 1 THIS C^TXIEIEItsr TO IFOIRTSIMIOTTTigC

information which would enable him to
confirm the dispatch from New York to
the effect that the Union Paclflc Company
had purchased the Speyer-Huntlngton in
terests In the Southern Pacific Railway.
â¢ "I hope it may be true," Bald Mr. Dick
inson. "Such an acquisition would be of
immeasurable value to our road. No: I
have not one word of t information on the
subject. Mr. Burt is in New York, as are
the attorneys and other officials, and
hence such a transaction would not be re-,
pprted to us here. Whoever buys the
Speyer-Huntington stock will get control
of the whole Southern Pacific system
from Ogden to Sacramento and from San
Francisco to Los Angles and New Or
leans. A continuous line from the river
to the coast has long been the dream of
the Union Pacific officials." . â¢
Another official in position to get the
best information says there has been con
siderable gossip the. last month over the
prospective purchase of the Ogden-Sacra
mento line, but he did not think that any
other part of the Southern Pacific system
would be included in the deal If made.
Everybody knows, he said, that Chairman
Harriman could make such a purchase if
he wanted to do so.
SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE GREAT
STOCK DEAL
ern Pacific of the Pacific Mall Steamsh'p
Company, with Its immense distributing
power on the Pacific Coast.
The acquisition cf tne Southern Pacific
Is merely another move In the "commun
ity of interest" pol<cy. which has already
secured such a vast hold on the railroads
of the countr.*. it means the establish
ment of an ell rail transcontinental read
governed dlrerUy by this policy. Mr.
Harrlman is president of the Chicago and
Alton road. He Is also a director In the
Union Pacific. In the Illinois Central, In
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany and In the Oregon Short Line Rail
road Company. In the Alton syndicate,
by which Harrlman obtained control of
t/iat rdf d, the Vanderbilts were generally
credited with participating to the extent
of $5,030,000 and the Gould and Rockefeller
Interests each to the same amount. It H
believed that George Gould will be Invited
Into the present syndicate If he has not
already Joined.
The Union Pacific' already has an outlet
to the Pacific Coast through Its stock con
trol of the Oregon Short Line and the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany. But these lines reach the extreme
Northwest in Washington and Oregon.
The Central Pacific branch of the South
ern Pacific, however, will give the Union
Pacific a direct routeâ almost an air lino
route â from Ggden, its present western
most terminal, to San Francisco. The
Union Pacific will now have a direct
route eastward from San Francisco to
Omaha and Kansas City.
Reports have recently been current that
negotiations are pending for the control
of the Chicago. Burlington and Quincy,
which would meet the Union Pacific at
both thnaha a^l Kansas City, and afford
a. direct route to Chicago, where traffic
will be divided among the trunk lines,
which are already being operated under
the "community of interest" plan. Such
a plan, however, is not necessary for a
direct transcontinental line, for the Chi
cago and Alton already connects with the
Union Pacific at Kansas City and pro
ceeds to Chicago, and the Illinois Central
connects at Omaha and also proceeds to
Chicago.
At Chicago connection is made with the
Baltimore and Ohio for the Atlantic sea
board and thus Is established a complete
"Harriman" transcontinental route.
It may perhaps be a coincidence, but it
certainly appears highly significant that
the announcement of the purchase of the
control of the Southern Pacific should
follow so closely on the heels of the pur
chase by Mr. Harriman of the control of
the Chicago Terminal Transfer Company
and Its connecting lines. A week ago
Mr. Hajrlman bought the Deutscher Bank
holdings of this company through Messrs.
Kuhn. Loeb & Co., who are interested
with him in the deal, and who are like
wise Interested 1 with him In the present
deal. Extensive terminals in and about
Chicago are owned by the terminal com
pany. They comprise TOO acres, with a
total of 230 miles of track. The com
pany also owns the Grand Central pas
senger station and 3500 feet of docks on
the Chicago River.
The consensus of opinion of men inter
ested in railroads and stock markets is
that the price paid for the Huntington
shares was about $50 per share. The
Speyer holdings are known to have aggre
gated about 550,000. if not COO.000, so that
with the Huntington block the new inter
ests have about 1,000.000 shares, or half of
the capital stock. Rumor has It that the
Speyers got $48 a share for their stock. It
is stated on authority, however, that the
Speyers have not sold their Southern Pa
cific bonds.
Chairman Tweed was requested to make
some statement dealing with the reported
chanere of control, but he twice declined
to say anything. With Acting Vice Presi
dent Gates of the Southern, Mr. Tweed is
an executor of the late C. P. Huntington's
will. The banking-house of Speyer & Co',
was for some years prior to Mr. Hunting
ton's death the fiscal agent of the Hunt
ington properties. The Speyers are known
to have held large amounts of Southern
Pacific stocks and bonds for their Euro
pean clients.
According to current reports they were

From a reliable source, however. It may
be stated that tha holdings of the Hunt
ington estate in the Southern Pacific have
lx-enacquirod by the same interests which
purchased the Speyer stock and that the
two block?, in connection with recent
purchases in the open market, which have
been responsible for thÂ» sharp advance in
Southern Pacific securiUe?, havo given
the purchasers a working control of the
Southern Pacific Company.
The staument that Union Pacific-Harrt
man interests predominateinthe syndicate
rni.y be made on authority. The syndicate
Is composed, in tho first place, of the
capitalists who have been behind E. H.
Harriman. including Kuin. Loeb & Co.,
Â¦who. it will be recalled, have very close
r lations with the Pennsylvania Railroad
Interests, and, second, the Rockefeller in
lerestxj represented by the National City
J.Mr.k.
There Is pood authority for 'saying that
the Huntlngton stocks were secured some
weeks ago. The amount of such holdings
Is not a matter of public knowledge.
They were bequeathed by Mr. Hunting
ton. Mrs. Huntinpton receiving two-thirds
and Henry Edward Huntlngton one-third,
p uhjoct to the condition that "such shares
should rot. in whole or In part, be dis
posed of during the life time of either.
* xcept v.-ith tho consent of both such
Jf-sateps or the survivor of them."
About one year agoâ before tbe death of
Mr. Hui:j!nÂ«tonâ what was known asÂ« the
Speyor-Huntington syndicate acquired, ac
â¢oordini? to published reports, the Crocker
holdings, par value J23,00a,000; the Stan
inrd holdings. $30,000,000, and the Hubbard
, holdings, 52,000,000.- It was also reported
at the time that the syndicate had pur
chased the Soarles holdings at $26,000,000,
but this was subsequently denied. At the '
last annual meeting of the Southern Pa
ciiic Mr. liuniir.jrton voted nine-tenths of
the stocks, â¢which included the proxies of
Spcypr & Co. and their friends.
The total authorized stock of the South
ern Pacific is $206,0iÂ».000, including $57,274.
247 exchanged in 1S33 for Central Pacific
stock?. The Southern Pacific Company
owns no stock in fee, but principally
throuph ownership of stock and partly by
lcase. it operates a great system of roads
extending from San Francisco to New Or
leans < thence by company's Fteamers u>
Xew York, etc.), and to Portland, Or., and
to Ogden, Utah, with branches.
The importance of the new deal grows
â¢when viewed in connection with the ac
quisition in Xovember last by the South-
Pacific to this city. If predictions of lead
ing railway men be verified Callforntans
will not have cause to regret the change
in management .which is to bring the Van
derbilts into closer relations wjth thei
traveling public of the Pacific Coast. Thtf
Vanderbilt system Is Justly noted for
several admirable features of railway con
trol. Passenger trains are run at the
highest speed consistent with safety. The
equipment is first-class. â¢ The conductors
and trainmen are- obliging and capable.
It is true that one of the former Vander
bilts said the "public be damned." but It
is obvious that he had in mind the public
that did not patronize his road. '
NO CHANGES
IN THE LOCAL
MANAGEMENT
It Is Believed That
President Hays Is
to Retain His
Position.
>
Local railroad officials refused to credit
the rerJort of the big deal when it first
became current early yesterday afternoon.
Later, however, as fresh dispatches con
firming ' the story were received, greater
confidence was displayed and even the
most conservative ones began to take tha
thing seriouslv. They "declared that while
such a gigantic deal seemed Improbable,
still, it was not beyond the bounds of
possibility.
Up to early last evening President
Charles M. Hays had received no official
confirmation of the story. He did not care
to express an opinion until the report hai
been verified.
, Accepting the report as official local
railroad men do not look for any remark
able change in the conditions on the Pa
cific Coaat.
"Harriman controls the Short Line and
the Oregon Navigation roads, yet both
have separate offices and managers from
the Union Pacific, and I believe that if he
controlled the Southern Pacific that fact
wouldn't make any material difference In
local representation or management," was
the- opinion expressed by one official when
asked to contemplate future possibilities.
It is a well-known, fact that the Union
Pacific has been expending vast sums of
money the past few years Improving Its
lines. Last year $3,000,000 was spent In the
work of shortening and straightening thÂ«
company's lines between Ogden and
Omaha. The work is still in progress and
will probably not be .wholly completed for
a year or more. Grades are being reduced
and curves dispensed with and already
the distance from Ogden to Omaha has
been shortened thirty miles. It is said
that a total of 57,000,000 has been set aside
by the company for this work.
All this Is taken as an indication that
the Union Pacific has been preparing the
way for a great railroad system, such as
a consolidation with the Southern Pacific
would effect.
It has always been the policy of the
Harriman syndicate to keep abreast with
the times, If not in advance. As a result
the lines under the Harriman control are
to-day second to none in the country. Im
provements are ever being made. '.'.
Harriman represents the interests of the
Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and J. Pierpont
Morgan, and it was stated at the time he
purchased a large block of stock In the
Pacific Mall that he acted for the Van
derbilts. Harriman is at present a direc
tor in the Pacific Mail.
It was stated some two months ago that
Hi E. Huntlngton contemplated disposing
of the Huntington interests in the South
ern Pacific, but the report was peremptor
ily denied by Mr. Huntington. A few days
ago Mr. Huntlngton received a very ur
gent telegram summoning him to New
York. . Although he had made plans to ac-
Purchase of the Stock Held by the Huntington, Crocker, Searles and Stanford Interests by the Great
Vanderbilt-Harriman SyndicateâThis Means" That the Buyers Have Secured the First Direct

company his family to the Eastern me
tropolis two days later, the business was
of such an important nature that an im
mediate departure ; was necessary. It is
now believed that the important business
mentioned in the telegram was in connec
tion with the sale of the Huntlngton
stock.
The Huntington interests in the South
ern Pacific, Pacific Mail and Pacific Im
provement are said to amount to some
thing like J4O.0C0.00O. ,
It was stated by a railroad official last
night that I5O.0CO shares of Southern Pa
cific stock were sold in London yesterday
at from 47 to 49^. The supposition Is that
the English shareholders, who have been
holding on to their stock for a long time,
were given a tip.' and when the stock,
reached a profitable mark the holders
promptly sold out. It is thought there
will be another big fall to-day. The Spey
ers are known to have represented large
English holdings.
T. M. Schumacher, local representative
of the Union Pacific, had received no con
firmation of the report up to a late hour
last night. "All I know is what I have
heard oh the street and have seen in the
papers," said Mr. Schumacher, "But I
would not be at all surprised if there was
something back of the report. If Harri
man has got control of the stock he is un
questionably acting for the Vanderbilt In
terests. I do not think the deal would af
fect local conditions to any great extent,
though, of course, you can't tell what
might happen."
C. L. Canfleld, local representative of
the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul lines,
who has Just returned from the East. In
speaking of the reported deal last even-
Ing said:
"If the Union Pacific has got control of
the Southern Pacific It means one of the
biggest railroad deals of the times. Har
rlman is a great financier and a shrewd
stock manipulator.' In my opinion he is
backed by J. Pierpont Morgan and the
Rockefellers. The latter have more money
than they know what to do with, and they
could not have hit upon a better invest
ment than by acquiring the Southern Pa
cific stocks.
"The Speyers have heretofore held the
controlling interest. Tiiey placed Mr.
Hays at the head of the big. Kentucky
corporation. They have also represented
large English holdings, and If It 1st true
that 150,000 Southern Pacific shares. were
sold in London to-day then I guess there
is no doubt that Harrlman is in control.
"The change, in my opinion, will not af
fect local conditions any to speak of. OÂ£
course. Mr. Hays will remain where he is,
and the only noticeable difference will be
in the closer relationship that will take
place between the two big roads. Mr.
Harriman is chairman of the board of di
rectors of the Union Pacific and la really
the head of that company. He is also
largely identified with the Illinois Central.
The Oregon Short Line and the Oregon
Railroad and Xavigatlon Company are
part of the Union Pacific, and it Is my
opinion that if the Southern Pacific has
been bought up it will continue to be run
as at present, just as are the Oregon com
panies."
If the poor people did but know how lit
tle some millionaires enjoy their wealth
there would be less envy in the world.â

between stern and bows. Then a quarter
of a mile behind, but seeming across the

royal yacht Alberta, the vessel on which
the eyes of the world may be said to have

At her stem stood a tall officer, uniformed
in dark blue, alone, as motioniesa as part
of the ehJp. The union jack was at the
foremast, the royal standard fell from
half-way up the mainmast and the naval
ensign trailed from her stern. ' The after
deck of the yacht was roofed with a
white awning and beneath the awning,
through glasses, could be seen the cata
falque of royal purple and ruby lines on
which rested the colnn. Four officers in
somber uniforms stood at the four cor

toward the ships. A few other persons
could be seen clustered on the Alberta's
deck. As the funeral yacht moved slowly
past the decks of the warships were
crowded with their crews. They were all
manned to their full complement. The
sailors in blue, with straw hats, formed a
solid mass along the decks of each ship,
standing with their arms at "attention."
A line of scarlet coats topped by snowy,
shining helmets, showed where the ma

were also manned. The officers stood out

Weary and heavy-eyed from the worries and cares' of the

would be one night of gentle, restful, refreshing sleepâsleep that
would soothe and strengthen the worn-out nervous tissues and
replenish the wasted brain cells. There is a way to get just that
kind of sleep. Will you find the way ? ,

The bench show committee of the San
Francisco Kennel Club is hard at work on
the preliminaries of the May bench show,
and many important details have already
been settled. H. D. La id law will of Heinle
as manager and J. C. Langenderfer as su
perintendent. Mr. Wcyman has been
slated for ring steward, but the appoint
ment has not yet been definitely made.
The members of the St. Bernard Club
of California are very anxious to have
Miss Whitney of New York to judge the
"saintly" breed, and to that end the In
dividual members have subscribed a guar
antee fund, that is almost large enough
already to justify the San Francisco Ken
nel Club .in assuming the balance of the
expense. Among the Judges under'con
sideration by.*he bench show committee
besides Miss Whitney are James 1 Cole of
Kansas City. James J. Lynn of Port Hu
ron, an expert on terriers of all breeds,
and Henry Jarrett, of Philadelphia, well
known as a breeder of collies and terriers.
The choice of the club will undoubtedly
fall on one or two -of these candidates,
who represent all that is best. In American
kenneldom. The greyhound men have sent
in a request to the club to allow a sepa
rate judge for the greyhounds." and have
suggested the name of John Bradshaw as
the best fitted lor the position.
W. E. Meek's mastiff champion Califor
nia Cube has sired no less than thirty
puppies within the-.past month.. of which
eleven were out of- James L. Flood's Myra

The first member of the Pacific Kennel
League -to hold a show under the new
classification will ; probably be the Seattle
Kennel Club. There can be no doubt that
the assimilation of the league's rules to
those of the American Kennel Club Is a
wise move and may do much to strength
en the league, as - exhibitors 'will Â¦ find it
eaEie'r to make their entries and will . be
better able to understand their winnings.
The change. was made on the petition of
the Seattle Kennel Club and was carried
mainly at the instance of the . secretary
of the league, Norman J. Stewart

The new creen committee .of the. San
Francisco Golf Club will soon issue a
schedule of events for men. No event is
set down for to-day on the Presidio links,
but advantage will be taken, of the fine
condition of the course to play some prac
tice games and probably some matches In
the round robin tournament.
On Â¦ Monday morning Â¦ on the '. links of
the Soji Francisco Golf Club .there will
be women's foursomes, over 18 holes,
medal play, for which the following en
tries, have been made: .. Miss Morgan and
Miss Drum, Miss Crockett and Mies Ha

Mrs. R. G. Brown and Mrs. Scott. Last
month there seemed to be Â¦ some : likeli
hood of a home-and-home match between
teams of ladies "'representing the; San
Francisco and Oakland Golf clubs, to be
conducted on the same conditions. as the
home-and-home tournaments i among .. the
men, but no definite. arrangements have
yet been made.' â¢
Last Suhday'L. O. Kellogg and Robert
Johnstone, the professional,- at the Pre
eidio links," played a foursome against H.
D. Pillsbury and J. W. Byrne, the latter
couple receiving two bisques. There was
not time to finish- an 18-hole' match: and
the game terminated at the twelfth hole
without advantage to either side. . There
is also talk of getting up a match be
tween teams of - caddies representing Â« the
San Francisco . and Â¦ Oakland . Golf clubs
The contest would be a, home-and-home
tournament, over IS holes, and each team
would probably consist Of ,â six .caddies.
Borne of the caddies, play quite | a strong
game and the match.- would arouse 1 , con

who qualified for the finals of the eecond

in that league. Their styles of game are
very dissimilar. Hodgkinson jilays a

DIVOECE GRANTED TO
â¢ MRS. RICHARD H. HUNT
Wife of a Wealthy New York Archi-
tect and Sister of Mrs. Oliver
Harrtman Jr.
! HOT SPRINGS, So. Dak., Feb. l.-A de
cree of divorce was granted to-day to
Mrs. Richard H. Hunt, wife of a wealthy
architect of New York, and sister of Mrs.
Oliver Harriman Jr.
. Such careful . precaution has been ob
served to keep It a secret that It was not
until to-day that it became known a de
cree had been granted.
Those who know - Mrs. Hunt were no
more surplsed by the news that she " had
obtained. a decree than they were by the
statement which W. K. Vanderbllt caused
to, be made. This was to the effect that
he and his friends had not come here in
the Interests of Mrs. Hunt, nor did they
know anything about the divorce proceed
ings. Mr. Vanderbllt gave it to be un
Â¦derstood he was here on a trip of Inspec
tion of his railroads and was on his way
to Bait Lake City.
â¢ In her petition Mrs. Hunt merely set
forth that she had been deserted by her
husband, although she had been faithful
as a wife. She asked for an absolute di
vorce, and left to the court's decision as
to what her husband should be required
to contribute to her support, and that of
her three children. "The separation of tho
Hunts about a year ago created a sensa
tion in society. It was soon followed by
the announcement that Mr. and Mrs. Wal
ter "VVlllson Watrous. who occupied the
house near by and who had been on the

DIAMOND ITEMS.
Â¦ SAN DIEGO. Feb. 1.â The members of
the present San Diego baseball team are
getting pretty well placed for the contest
in the northern league next summer.
Mike Donlln has affixed his name to a
contract to play with Los Angeles as
change pitcher and fielder. He was the
Ftar twirler of the northern league only
a short time since and went back to St
l>3uis ae change pitcher. He was found
fo valuable in the field and at first base
that he was not in the box for the East
ern team . much of the time during the
jia^t season.
.Bowman, â¢who. next to Devcreaux, has
thÂ« highest batting a\-erage of the team
r.i.sn goes to Los Angeles, where he was
picked up because of the fact that he Is
petting his eye on the ball In such a "way
that doubles and 'triples are more fre-
Qunfit than Fingles in his score card.
Taylor, who writes out his answers to
questions asked, is said to be huffy at
<:al Ewing for telling some of the things
which were supposed to bÂ« secrets be
tween thrm. He thinks that the manager
of the Oakland team talks too much, and
intimates that If Cal Ewlng cannot take
a. reef in his speech he will have to flni
another pitcher, contract or no contract.
Saturday and Sunday the San Diegos
and the Al Levys will meet on the local
diamond LaÂ»t Saturday the locals
batted Iburp out of the box. They would
have done the same thing with the next
pitcher, but the Levys had no third man
to use.

THE backers and followers of Tod
Sloan are disconsolate and In the
dumps again over his latest de
feat. Tod had the mount on Edna
'y * Brown, 9 to 10 favorite for the
Spinster stakes at Tanforan yesterday.
The distance was a mile and Edna looked
so much the best on paper that all, or
nearly all of the smart division, climbed
aboard. Of the other four fillies entered,
Maresa, the half-sister to Howard, ap
peared to be the contender, though
Bavassa and Bab called for some scatter
ing support. After tha start, Mounce, on
Maresa. lost no time in talcing his mount
out In the lead. At the first turn, J. Mil
ler, astride Bab, tried to squeeze his way
through between Bevassa and Mare.-u,
and down in the dust went horse and
rider. Mareea soon held a commanding
lead, with Sloan, on the first choice, tak
ing matters quietly ten lengths in the
rear. When the stretch was reached tho
leader showed small sigms of stopping and
Sloan began riding the favorite. He clung
to the rail and less than a furlong from
the stand was badly cut off by Henry, on
Bavassa. Then compelled to take up and
go around Sloan rode with desperation.
The wire was too close, the time too short,
aÂ»d though very tired, Maresa lasted long
enough to win by a length in 1:42^.
With the result over the attention of the
crowd was attracted to Bab, which still
lay stretched out on the track, appar
ently lifeless. It was only a case of
knockout, however, the filly being led
over to the stable a few minutes later
with a broken nose for the veterinary to
operate on. Miller suffered a fracture of
the collar-bone, which will keep him out
of the saddle for a couple of weeks or
more.
In all three favorites crossed the line
firstâ EdinborouEh In the opening event;
Jerid and Andrattus. Tne betting was
brisk enough, even if the fields had no
marked pretensions to class. â¢_ \ : ->.v - ~
Harry Stover had Edlnborough entered
In the first number, a live and a half fur
long sprint., and the horse was heralded
as "the coods." Backed down to 8 to 5
favoritism, Burns had the Imp. Albert
horre in front from the start, beating out
Moringa a length. Mrs. C. was bo heav
ily played that 5 to 1 was the best ob
tainable around post- time. She showed
early speed, but did not carry it very far.
Rory Ough, a half brother to Dunboy,
and quite a speedy youngster, captured
the- two-year-old dash from a big Meld.
Backed from 10 to 5, Bullman had Rory
in front soon as the barrier was released,
reaching the Judges four lengths before
Legal Maxim. Snooze ran a close third.
Campbell & Doble's Florista downed a
cheap assortment in the mile for maiden
three-year-olds. The filly had the most
speed, and after cutting out all the run
ning, lasted long enough to beat Camba
ceres a head. Golden, the 11 to 5 favorite,
with Henry in the saddle, never looked
dangerous.
Asked to turn down a. less speedier lot
of .sprinters, Jerld made a runaway race
of the fifth event. Once quoted at %
the chestnut horse's odds were backed
down at post time to 11 to 6. Nullah dis
posed of Foul Play for the place. ..
Track Notes.
Apdrattus enjoyed an easy thinjr of it
io tho first race. Closing favorite over
Bernota he won galloping. Compass, at
15 to 1, nosed out Bernota for the place.
Besides the - four-cornered sweepstake*,

quarters is down for decision.

leaders.
Mrs. C was extensively backed to win
the opening sprint. She happened to meet
Ldlnboroush. said to have been sold In
the East for $5000, and the rest is ancient
history.
Miller blamed Henry for his fall at the
flrt>t turn on Bab. In the stretch Henry
deliberately and palpably fouled Sloan on
the favorite. Only tho day before this
same rider, with the leg up on Native,
pulled in toward the rail, ruining- all
chances of Sad Sam. Henry is not allowed
pn the Oakland track for reasons best
known to the officials there. If he has se
cured the "bumping privilege" at Tau

calls for attention.

without help from Professor ilaonlne or
the court."
Mrs. Manning said she mot tha hand
some ex-pugilist and physical culture pro

wealth and as an "oil king." Mrs. Manning
was captivated and the two became bosom

around, pointed out his valuable proper
ties, accidentally showing her newspaper
clippings wherein he was called an #r oil
king." . Mrs. Manning was hypnotized,
and on October 30 thev werÂ» married

a castle built In Brlt'sh Columbia by a
German Count and deeded to her mother
by the aforesaid, Count: that this was onlv
a mere pittance In comparison with tha
wealth of her family and of what she waa
the possessor. He wa* happy because ha
had married well and his futurÂ« wa*

The battles between James Brltt and
"W. L. Bevert Jr.. light-weights, and F.
H. McConnell and W. Snailham, bantam
weights, were easily tho star events of
the programme, |
Only in one. decision did the Judges'
verdict fall ' to please, the bout between
T.> A. , Rlordan and J.' Lundy provoking
much dissatisfaction, as j Lundy was
clearly the better, fighter. 'â¢â¢ -.:
The opening bout was between. Lewis
Long, Reliance Athletic Club, and J.
Moran, Pacific Athletic Club. Moran was
hard as! nails, had Long bleeding from a
series of stiff punches, and was entitled
to the decision given him.
W.J. Leonard, Olympic Athletic Club,
and .William KrelLng, San Francisco Ath
letic Club,, hooked up in the second bout:
Leonard stood Krellng off Â¦ cleverly/Cnd
had his eye swelling. at the call _o^ time. 1
Kreling had an ugly 'punch, butcouldn't
land effectually. A series of straight left
jabs settled Krellng, and Leonard got the
verdict. I
James Howard, unattached, met D.
Danziger in the third number on the pro
gramme. Both were cautious, but Dan
ziger whipped some speedy swings over
in the first round. Howard used the Morse
code and failed to land through telegraph
ing a bunch of cumbersome leads. How
ard mixed It fiercely in the last round,
but Danziger had a shade on the earlier
rounds and was awarded the decision.
J. Lundy and T. A. Riordan. both unat
tached, opened the fourth bout in cyclone
fashion. Lundy had all the speed in the
first. He tapped the claret splggot and
had Rlordan dizzy early In the game. He
dropped his man nicely with a right swing
on the Jaw, and continued in the second
round to make Riordan's Jaw an easy tar
get. The flght was fast and the crowd
grew noisy. Rlordan liked the grueling
and got ali that was coming to him be
fore the round closed. In the third Rior
dan was pretty well pumped out, but still
had a punch left. Another round was or
dered, when tho Judges disagreed. The
verdict was out of line, and a decision
should have been rendered by the referee
under the rules. â¢
Without protest, save from the crowd,
they went at It again. The men did not
stand on the order of milling and â¢ went
the pace to the end. Riordan got the de
cision, and the crowd yelled "Its dis
approval. Lundy was clearly entitled
,to the fight before going the extra round,
and doubly so after he had punched Rlor
dun's head Into a trance. Â¦ /
Tho welter-weights came next. M. J.
Broen. Olympic Athletic Club, and W. J.
Lawlor. unattached, tried ' conclusions.
Breen had the best of a slow argument,
put his man on the carpet with a lucky
left and got thjQ decision.

was too heavy as carded among- the light

tho California heavy-weight, put out Jack
McCormick of Texas in less than two min
utes before the Colorado Athletic Associa
tion to-night. The bout wa3 scheduled for
ten rounds. Russell jabbed his right hard
to McCormick's mouth shortly after the
fight beean and. this was followed by a
series of wild swings and clinches. Kus
sell forced McCormlck Into his own corner
and swung to McCormick's head with his
right,' Tho latter doubled up and went
down and out. The blow did not seem
to have much force and McCormlck only
walled for the ten count, when he got up
and left the ring without assistance. The
spectators were disgusted.
Kid Lavelle of Butte. Mont., and a local
man named Shoemaker fought five rounds
to a draw, as did Buddy King of Denver
and Jack Donnelly of SL Louis. The sec

bearing trees than any other equal area in the world,
and these trees are either the largest in dimensions or
bear the largest cones that the earth has produced.
The cone-bearing trees of the Pacific Slope number
fourteen genera, or families, comprising seventy spe
cies or kinds of trees, and thirteen genera with forty
species are in California. Of these twenty-seven are
pines, two larches, five spruces, two hemlock spruces,
two false hemlock spruces, ten firs, two redwoods,
two American cedars, seven cypresses, nine junipers
and two yews.
Our sugar, yellow and Jeffrey pines are the largest
trees of that family; no foreign pines attain half'their
dimensions. Two of our spruces, the Douglass and
the tideland spruce of the north coast, are the largest
and most valuable of their kind in the world. Five of
our firs, the red bar%, the white bark, the Shasta, the
Grand and the Noble, are three times as large as any
Eastern or foreign firs. Nowhere on the planet are
any trees approaching in size our two redwoods.
By way of comparison, to demonstrate the richness
of our forest endowment, Professor Lemmon puts the
Ecstern continent, Europe and'Asia, alongside. That
continent is 9000 miles across, while ours is only 3000.-
But of the eighty species of pines the Eastern conti
nent has only twenty while we have sixty. Our. part
of the continent from the Rocky Mountains to the
Pacific, 1000 miles, has ' forty of the sixty American
kmds^and of these California has twenty, or, as many'
Zi. the whole Eastern continent If the distribution
were equal, and the Eastern continent had sixty and
America twenty, the Pacific Slope would be entitled
to six kinds, and California would be entitled to one
spe r icÂ£ instead of twenty.
Professor Lemmon's valuable monograph" describes
the migration of our.trees and their return to the con-'
ditions which favor their West development. His work
THIS continent had the greatest forest endow-*
ment in the world, and its richest part wai
planted in this Northwestern portion. The
natural conditions for this sumptuous growth are sup
plied by the Japan current, distributing heat and
moisture, and the trade winds from the Pacific, which
aid the effects of the warm current, practically supply
ing transportation.
Professor Lemmon, the botanist and dendrologist.
in a recent monograph upon this subject, says that
these Northwestern forests possess more kinds or

PERSONAL MENTION.
Dr. Stebbins says that he has had considerable ex
perience in this line of affairs, and he has been again
and again impressed with the almost barbaric wrong
that is perpetrated under the present law. An estate
in his care was wrested from him -through a sheer
technical construction of the existing statute, and he
was mulcted in $4000 expenses where in his own care
$400 would have sufficed. Moved by this sense of
injustice Dr. Stebbins exclaims: "We applaud, the
benefactors of society, the founders of charities,
schools and colleges; but no benefaction, charity or
school can diffuse the good that a wise and just law
confers."
A distinguished minister of the Gospel, the Rev.
Horatio Stebbins, in commending the bills now before
the Legislature, writes that he' feels "it will not be
out of place to express my earnest, unselfish hope that
the bills will become law."

legislation. The waste of small properties in this way
is to be deplored, but it can be corrected in the man
ner indicated. We allude to small estates particu
larly, because the wealthy can usually protect them
selves; but the poor are mostly at the mercy of legal
sharks.
/~* ERTAIN bills have been introduced into the
( Legislature designed to lessen the cost of- pro-.
ceedings in probate. This is a praiseworthy
purpose, and these projects ought to be considered
carefully by the legislators^ the interest of the poor
people who are necessitated to have recourse to the
courts. Many of these matters inflict hardship upon
women and children already sorely tried by the loss of
their bread-winner, and it seems cruel to add to their
agony, already acute enough, by taking from their
mouths their morsel of meat and bestowing it upon
the probate parasites. ~y>> -.-';
PROBATE REFORMS.
It is rather disquieting to observe that so far dur
ing the investigation responsibility has been passed
down the line, the Commissioners Having volubly dis
avowed responsibility, only to pass it to the secretary,
who passes it on -to a subordinate, who passes it, in an
indefinite manner, to the vouchers. This leaves no
cne to vouch for the vouchers, so that it seems now
improbable that there will be any really useful result
At Paris last year was an unofficial exhibit, in the
collection, packing, transporting and installing of
which the State Board of Trade was again concerned.
It was shown as an ensemble exhibit, all together,
and was highly approved by the Californians who saw
it. We suppose that its cost can be ascertained, and
with it and the Hamburg data some idea of the cost
of such work can be' reached for the purpose of com
parison-
The people can easily secure certain data that will
enable them to reach a conclusion as to the kind of
service rendered by the commission. The State in
stalled en exhibit at the Hamburg food show, a few
years ago, which was managed by the State Board oi
Trade. It was immediately productive of trade or
ders and resulted in the export of many hundreds of
carloads of our dried and tinned fruit, producing a
large profit for our producers and canners and driers,
and the whole cost of the exhibit was less than $6ooo.
All these things are unfortunate, but they empha
size the need of investigation of the matter. There
will be other great expositions, and California will
want to be present. A complete statement of the
facts connected with her official representation at this
one will inform and admonish the people usefully
when they seek. again to exhibit our resources
abroad. . ' â¢ -
What is needed is not a ground plan and front ele
vation of the drunks and carousals indulged in at
Faris, but a statement of account showing how much
of the people's money went for the collecting, trans
porting, installing and explanation of the State's ex
hibit. Then will appear how much of the appropria
tion went into entertainment and the enjoyment of
personal pleasures. When this purely business mat
ttr is gone into by the committee it should not be
sidetracked by personal slanders about wine
bibbing and wine-stealing, nor pleasant tales about
great winnings at cards, nor even lurid reports of per
sonal enconnters. "
We think such an attitude unjustifiable. A large
sum of money, belonging to the taxpayers of this
State, has been spent. Citizens of California, inter
ested and disinterested, who visited the exposition,
have reported, with practical unanimity, that the
State's official exhibit did not exhibit, that it was lost
in the shuffle. The Commissioners themselves have
made admissions about the awarding of medals which
destroy the awards as an expression of judgment as
to merit and excellence.
Some of the persons concerned have treated the in
vestigation as a personal insult
AS the investigation of the Paris Commission
proceeds the necessity for it seems to unfold
like a phonographic record that has been made
in a mixture of sounds coming from Bedlam, Bil
lingsgate and the old Jardin Mabille.

THIRTY PRODIGAL SONS IN STOCK.
In a little shop at Port Said an Englishman has Btarted one of the most
curious businesses in the world. He has an immense stock of colored pictures
of all sizes. Illustrating the events recorded in the Bible. The figures In these :
pictures are of all nationalities, from the pigtalled Chinee to the nesro of
Central Africa, f&ii
One subjectâ the return of the prodigal sonâ is drawn In over thirty differ
ent ways. In one picture the figures are almond-eyed Chinamen, in other
South Sea Islanders. Hindoos Samoans, Malays, Dyaks and other races in
all parts of the world.
In one picture, which is Intended to represent the miraculous draught of
fishes, the disciples are shown In a Chinese junk, which Is so loaded with fish
that it seems In great danger of being swamped. These pictures are produced
for missionaries, and are sold in enormous numbers.
It i3 difficult to make a native take any Interest In people who are of an
altogether different race, but he shows a lively interest in a drawing of a
man of his own type. The missionaries show him these pictures, his atten
tion is caught, ahd he soon learns the meaning. The Englishman who sup
plies these colored nrlnts has sold Immense numbers, and they have been car
ried to the ends of the earth. They caan be bought aj all prices, from 6 cents
a. dozen to 30 cents each, and tho sales average from 70,000 to 100,000 every

Mister Nation's Apathy.
It appears that Mrs. Helen IX Nation,
the woman who Is carrying a hatchet
from one Kansas town to another and
smashing saloon windows with it. has
been twice married. Mr. Nation Is her sec
ond love, and from trustworthy sources
we get reports to the effect that he la not
in sympathy with the lady in her present
operationsâ at least not heart, and soul.
Taking all tho facts of the case Into con
sideration, we are surprised at the gentle
man's apathy. From the Atchison Daily
Globe we learn that Mrs. Nation's first
husband was a drunkard. Our contem
porary adds that he was probably driven
to drink, but we shall not Jump at conclu
sions in that direction. He may have had
troubles that he wished to drown In the
flowing: bowl,, and then again it is possible
that he was a drunkard merely because
he found It easy to wobble from the paths
of decency. â¢ Be that as it may. we are
given to understand that Mrs. Nation is
now endeavorinp tjo have revenge for her
first husband's fallings. Because he went
down to a. drunkard's crave, .leaving her
Â¦wretched and alone, she proposes, with,
her hatchet and her finger nails, to put a
stop to the saloon business. This may bo
praiseworthy on her part. The grogshop la
an unworthy institution, and we hope the
day is not far distant when it will be onlv
a shameful memory. But is Mrs. Nation's
motive a worthy one? Is a mad desire for
vengeance to be praised, even when It
may accomplish that which shall' be of
public benefit?. We leave thl3 to bÂ« set
tled by the exponents of the higher eth
ics and the representatives of the more
advanced thought. It Is Inconceivable,
though, why Mr. Nation does not Join his
wife In her crusade. If she has bÂ«?er\
wronged by the saloon-keepers it would
seem that he has been doubly offended, by
them. If the lady's first husband had nor
been killed by strong drink Mr. Nation
might to-day be â but It is unprofitable to
speculate, -after the Irrevocable has hap
pened, upon what might have been. WÂ«
can only wonder in silence at Mr. Na

with an ax. â Chicago Times-Herald.
SULU SULTAN'S FLAG
IS MADE OF CALICO
Looks Like an Article of Underwear, but Is Full of
Meaning.*
Our people have done fairly well without a State
inspector of oils with "a suitable number" of depu
ties, and it can continue to do so. There are doubt
less many things that California needs, but more
office-holders and taxeaters are not among them.
Many other objections- to the measure might bs
pointed out, but it is unnecessary to do so. The vital
objection is that California has already too many
officials. It would be better business and better poli
tics for the Legislature to diminish the number of
State officials and commissions than to increase them.
There are many .objections to the measure. In the
first place a man capable of rightly fulfilling the duties
required would be worth more than $1500 a year. In
the second place the right of appointing a suitable
number of deputies is not a proper one to confer on
a man working at a political job for $1500 a year. In
the third place the standard fixed for illuminating oil
is too high, being in excess of that established in
Pennsylvania. . \
The inspectors are to have authority to enter the
premises* of all manufacturers or dealers in oils, for
the purpose of inspection. They are required to reject
for illuminating purposes all oils which will emit a cdm
bustible vapor at a temperature of 120 degrees Fahren
heit. They are to collect 13 cents for each barrel, cask
o- package containing not exceeding fifty-five gallons,
and at the same proportionate rate for any excess over
that quantity. The money collected by the deputies'i.5
to be turned over to the State inspector, and the
State inspector is to render '/to the Board of State
Auditors quarterly a detailed account of all receipts
and. disbursements of his office to be audited and
allowed "by them if found correct, and 'if at the end of
the year there be any surplus it shall be paid into the
State treasury."
The proper thing for the Legislature to do with the
bill is to promptly kill it.
SENATOR CURRIER has introduced a bill pro
viding for the appointment of a State inspector
.of illuminating oils manufactured from'-; petro
leum or coal oils. The inspector is to have an annual
saJary of $1500 and "such further sum as he may ac
tually and necessarily expend in traveling expenses
?nd prosecutions incurred in discharge of .his duties."
He is authorized to' appoint "a suitable number of
deputies," and each deputy inspector "shall be entitled
to a salary payable monthly, the amount of sucti sal
ary to bg determined by the number of casks, bar
rels and packages actually -inspected during the
month. * * ? provided that in no case shall such
Inspector receive more than $100 as such salary."
This State should "do all that public : authority can
do, supplementing the efforts of the Federal Govern
ment, to secure the proper harvesting of. ripe timber
and preserve the coming crop. We protect the crop
of fish' grown in the waters' of the State and the witd
game of the land. Why let the crop of trees perish
in the fire or be exterminated by careless lumbering?
Why not a close season for the forests as well as
for the fish? . : , ...-.-Â¦

is one of the. greatest value to all who are interested

The missionary effort spent abroad would be better
invested at hdme. The Chinese who said to an Amer
ican missionary, "What for you want me in your
heaven and not in ( your country?" uttered the philos
ophy of the situation. We don't want the Chinese
among us, and it will be -just as well to omit mission
ary aggressions among them.
A Foreign Minister to Peking from one of the great^
powers has said much privately about the lack of dis-
Cittion shown by the missionaries. In one case in
which large indemnity was forced out of China he
said the trouble had a trivial beginning. Some Chi
nese children, playing near the missionary compound,
threw some sticks and stones against the stockade.
One of the missionaries ran out, seized a Chinese
child, dragged it inside and locked the gate. Tha
playmates of the little prisoner ran off c-ying and told
his parents. When they came and demanded their
child the missionaries refused to release him. Then
happened what was to have been expected â the whole
town rose in a mob, tore down the compound wall,
recovered the child and wrecked the buildings, just
ar a white mob would do in this city if a white child
were kidnaped and locked in the joss house on Jack
son street. The only difference would be that hern
a dozen Chinese would be killed in as many minutes.
The Government concerned compelled China to pay
large indemnity, when justice required that the whole
missionary party be punished for the original aggres
sion.
a merchant, but of a missionary. It was the presence
of German- missionaries in the interior, by virtue of a
missionary forgery in the treaty, that gave the Kaiser
the pretext for stealing a port and part of a sci
province. Naturally theft has followed forgery.
Our correspondent puts the blame on the commer
cial classes. This is true only in one respect The
building of railroads is offensive in China,, because
it violates tombs. We are not aware that Western
merchants have ever caused any trouble. The pretext
for Germany's seizure of Kiaochau was not the act of
We do not intend any attack on the missionary
spirit or Christian faith, but we insist that it does not
become Christendom to talk so much and so long and
so loudly about the dcceitfulness of Chinese dip
lomacy and the lyincj of Li Hung Chang. If their
diplomacy is crafty, who taught them its deceptions?
If they lie in national matters, whose example do they
We think that Bishop Potter is right. The Chinese
have had a mistranslation of Christianity.
Every bit of evidence and every circumstance of the
transaction goes to support the belief that the Chinese
trusted to Christian honor in the matter, and trusted
in vain.
Our correspondent says the Chinese Commissioners
signed the treaty with that clause in," and goes so far
as to say that they knew it. There is no evidence
that they knew it. Indeed the evidence is all the other
way. Â¦Â¦ They supposed they were signing a Chinese
copy of the French text. The missionary clause did
not appear in the French copy at all. The English
newspapers in Shanghai and Hongkong affirm that
the existence of the 'forged clause was unknown to
the Chinese signato-ies. The very intelligent native
press of Japan, with an intimate knowledge of the*
facts, declares that the existence of the forged clause
was unknown until the French missionaries, accom
plices of the forger, claimed the rights it protected
and referred to it as their authority for entering the
interior. . .
The treaty had been negotiated 1 in the usual man
ner. Its terms and details had been discussed and
agreed to. The Chinese diplomats read French, the
language of diplomacy. The protocol and draft of the
treaty were in that language and were perfectly under-
Stood by the representatives of China. There was no
missionary clause in the treaty, nor had the subject
entered into any of the discussions between the Com
missioners. By consent of all parties the treaty, as
agreed upon, in the French language, was given to a
French missionary to translate into Chinese. The
scoundrel knew that he was expected to render the
French text into Chinese text. He knew the nature
of the crime he committed by interpolating a forgery
into the text. He knew that it was a crime greater
than the breach of trust and betrayal of confidence
of which he was guilty in committing it. :
r\ CORRESPONDENT has admitted the truth
l~\ of our statement that the missionary clause in
â¢ * the Franco-Chinese treaty of i860 was a forgery.
True, he objects to the use of that term, but we pre
fer it, for no other describes the ac.t as well.

Water Front Notes.
The schooner Lily left here for Ump

the heads in the storm. Her foremast
went by the board and Captain Bottger
had to run before the gale In order to
save the mainmaBt. After some maneu
vering the schooner made port again last
night and will be laid up for repairs.
The big. barge Eastside was tied up at
the seawall preparatory to discharging
a big consignment of wheat xhat had
come down the San Joaquln RivtT. When
the gale struck her she began to bump
heavily, and soon many piles 'iad been
knocked out of the State property and
about 250 tons of wheat had gone over
board from the barge. The tug- Liberty
took the Eastside, which was stove In, to
the mud flats.
Some Minor Accidents.
Jacob Englund, a deckhand on the bay
schooner Harry, lost his life during the
norther. The vessel left Mission-street
wharf about 3:30 t>. m. for Vallejo with
a cargo of coal. When off Lombard-street
wharf the norther came down and the
sudden shift of wind caused the main
boom to swing over, knocking Englund
overboard. Captain . Drysdorff at Â«once
hove to the schooner and lowered a boat.
The ferry steamer San Rafael also low
ered a boat, but although the search
was kept up for nearly half an hour no
trace of the missing man. could* be found.
Captain Drysdorff finally put about and
came back to San Francisco. Englund
was in the employ of the Piper, Aden,
Goodall Company for years,, and was a
sober, industrious man. Captain Drys
dorff says the .boom swung over so
quickly that It was impossible for Eng
lund tp get out of the way, and that his
heavy sea boots probably took him down.

Old boreas made considerable trouble

The steamship Kvichak of the Alaska
Packers' Association fleet was tied up at
the wharf, being repaired and overhauled.
She Is only a year old. but the riveting
was not done as well as it might have
been. Ever since the vessel came here
from Portland there has been trouble with
her. and when she got back here from
Karluk on November 28 last It was found
necessary to overhaul her. A week or so
ago she was r.ent to ' the Union Iron
Works, and during the last few days the
work of re-riveting was pushed steadily
ahead. Thursday night found the old riv
ets cut out of one or two of the plate3
just as the 5 o'clock whistle blew. In
stead of stopping to put In the new rivets
the men put in wooden plugs. Intending
to finish the Job In the. morning.
When the norther came up the Kvichak
began to work, and the strain caused
many of the pins to drop out.: Then the
vessel began to fill through the openings
made, and when th& watchman made hiÂ»
escape ashore her -decks were almost
awash. The steamship lies In a comfort
able position, and It will not cost more
than J1500 to pump her out and put her
back at her moorings again. She will
easily be ready to sail for Alaska next

THE "norther" that blew up Thurs
day night did considerable dam
age on the bay. It did not last
long, but while It did things
hummed. A barge tied up at the
seawall was etove in and lost about 350
tons of wheat: a coasting; schooner lost
her foremast off the heads and had to
put back for repairs; one of the bay
schooners lost a man overboard, and the
steamer Kvichak was sunk at her moor
ings. All In all, It was a disastrous blow
while It lasted, and the bitter cold which
accompanied the wind added much to tho
discomfort of people on the bay and at
sea.
Quite a fleet of vessels got away Thurs
day, and every one of them must have
been caught in the northerly squall. It
will be lucky if the only dismasted schoon
er heard from is the one that made port
again yesterday.

and. the squire took both hands and turned
the top of his head round several Inches. Then
he i adjusted \ hla â¢â¢ spectacles. "I feel in the In
most compartments of my animal spirits a
most happlfying sense or the success . and
futility of all my endeavors to sarva the peo
ple of Flat Crick dees trick in -. my weak way
and manner." This burst of eloquence was de
livered with a constrained air and an apparent
' Amid all this unusual poetic material,
all this picturesque diction, there is a vein
of real pathos. Harte was first Inspired
by Dickens and in many respects he is
like him. He selects extremes as char
acters; he puts them into an environment
strange almost to the verge of impossi
bility; he uses broad comedy and senti
ment with a lavish hand, yet he is not
oversentimental like Dickens. His abund
ant wit and true pathos combine Into" a
humor which within its narrow limits is
superior to that of the great English
caricaturist. '"' His rare critical Judgment,
which is nowhere better shown than In
his extremely ludicrous parody of Dickens
in "Condensed Novels," enabled him to
follow only what was best In his distin
guished master. '
His humor Is at Its best in a few of his
earlier short stories, like "The Luck of
Roaring Camp" and "How Santa Claus
Came to Simpson's Bar." Without their
sly wit, their skillfully handled comedy,
their deep pathos, their humor, they
would indeed fall flat. ' Of real character
study they have very little, In plot and of
broad constructive power, they are sadly
wanting. "We see phases of life, but no
complete life. We get a burning moment
In a reckless career, but an instantaneous
photograph, and that is all."
The influence of Dickens: either directly
or through the works of Harte can be
traced' in. all of the mid-century litera
ture of locality. The first conspicuous
study of local environment alter the Cali
fornia tales was Edward Eggleston's
"Hoosler Schoolmaster.", a story of the
primitive days in Southern Indiana. On
a reduced scale, it is the work which
Dickens would have done had he been
born on Hoosler territory Instead â¢ of in
the lower circle of London. Take, for
Instance, his picture of Squire â¢ Hawkins.
who has been described aa having "a wig
of that dirty, waxy color, eo common to
wigs"; a semicircular row of whiskers
"dyed Â¦ a frightful dead black"; a huge
pair of spectacles, "a. glass eye differing
in color from its natural mate, ; perpetual
ly getting out of focus by turning: in or
out." and "a set of false teeth, badly
fitted, and given to bobbing â¢ up and
down.". He has just been elected to pre
side at a spelling school and rises to
thank the company for the honor:
"Plain Language from Truthful James,"
better known as "The Heathen Chinee,"
gave its author at once an international
fame. In his later poems Harte became
still more erratic in his literary methods,
mingling exclamations, fragmentary
ejaculations, slang and curious localisms
in a monologue that at once provoked im
mediate and widespread parody. In the
poem "Jim," for example, the miner who
has been questioning an apparent
stranger about his old "pardner," Jim,
and who has been assured by him that
he Is dead, suddenly recognizes in his in
former the supposed dead man:
Well, tharâ good-byâ
No more, sirâ Iâ
Eh?

The society is finally adjourned with
remnants of the .paleozoic age, with fos
sils and skulls of mammoths.
The distinctive feature of these studies'
of peculiar environments has been their
realism, their careful fidelity to life, their
reverent ' worship of "the god of things
as they are." Nearly all of them have
been made with sympathy, and nearly
all are full not only of fun and wit but
of real humor. Such careful artists as
Bret Harte, George W. Cable, Joel Chand
ler Harris and Sarah Orne Jewett may
be ranked as humorists in the most ex
clusive sense of the word. Much of their
work will bear comparison with, the best
humorous writings of oVir literature.
Bret Harte, who in some respects was
the literary father qf the group, first at
tracted the attention of the world by his
peculiar poetry, which depicted the life
and the language of the California mines
and gulches during the days of the gold
excitement. Much of this early poecry
had }n it a vein of rollicking fun mingled
with abundant sentiment. "The Society
on the Stanislaus" is one of the best -of
the group. The aim of the society was
scientific; its early meetings were peace
able and instructive, but it came to a
sudden end in a peculiar, Callfornlan way.
Brown of Calaveras had brought "a lot
of fossil bones" and had begun to address
the meeting in a learned way when he
was Interrupted by Jones, who .
Then asked the chair for a suspension of the
rules. "~-~.
Till he could prove that these same bones was
one of his lost mules. ~ ; _
Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile and said
he was at fault: .
It seemed he had been trespassing; on Jones'
family vault.
He was a most sarcastic man, this quiet Mr.
Brown.
And on several occasions he had cleaned out
the town.
Then Abner Dean of Angel's raised a point of
order, when .
A chunk of 'old red sandstone took him in the
abdomen.
And he smiled a kind of sickly smile and curled
up on the floor
And the subsequent proceeding's interested him
no more.
-The last quarter of the nineteenth i cen
tury haB been chiefly notable on its liter
ary side for the rise and development of
what may be termed the literature of lo
cality. The father of what may be termed
American provincial characterization was
undoubtedly Royall Tyler, who. as early
as 1786, began his clever studies of the
Yankee character. In the word3 of Lu
kens, "His nasal-twanged, vociferous, ec
centric, Inquisitive and roistering down
easter was a product of the soil." Irving
made use of this element to some extent
in his "Rip Van Winkle" and similar
sketches. "Sam Slick" and "Major Jack
Downing" used It freely. Mrs. Stowe, as
early as 1S4S, made minute /studies of
phases of New England life, and Lowell
and the dialect poets .like C. G. Leland
voiced many phases of 'provincial environ
ment, but it was not until 1S68, when Bret
Harte began In the Overland Monthly his
short stories of the California mines, that
therÂ© began what might be styled a stam
pede to this province of literature.
The field has. Indeed, been a rich one.
The vast area of America, its peculiar
history, its cosmopolitan population, its
marvelous diversity of environments, havo
resulted In an abundance of peculiar so
cial groups. All of these varied regions
rave had their chroniclers and in some
cases their laureates. John Hay, now the
Secretary of State, was the first to bring
before the literary world the Indiana
"Hoosiers" In his "Pike County Ballads"
and Edward Eggleston was the first to
record In prose their unique characteris
tics: George W. Cable, in a series of
strong dramatic novels, first revealed the
Creole world of the Louisiana lowlands;
Thomas Nelson Page and Joel Chandler
Harris have made accurate pictures of
the plantation negro; Mary N. Murfreeâ
"Charles Egbert Craddock"â has explored
the wild depths of the Tennessee Sloun
tains; Hamlin Garland has etched realis
tic sketches of life on the prairie farm;
Alice Frenchâ "Octave Thanet"â has pen
etrated the canebrakes of Arkansas, and
Mary Hallock Foote has entered the wild
mining camps of Colorado and Idaho.
New England, the earliest section of the
field to be explored, has been carefully
studied in all of Its sections by a little
group of keen and sympathetic observers,
mostly women â Mrs. Stowe, Rose Terry
Cooke, Nora Perry. Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps, Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary E. Wil
kins and others.

sense of a danger that he, S<iutre Hawkins,
might fall to pieces In his weak way antl

pecially the latter) of all attempts at recon
struction. For by this time the ghastly pupil
of the left eye. which was black, was look-
Ins way round to the ieft. while thi- little blue
one on the right twinkled cheerfully toward
the front. The front teeth would drop down
so that the squire's mouth was kept nearly
closed and his words whistled through.
A later phase of the literature of local
ity has been characterized by a more care
ful realism. There has been no attempt
to confine thÂ£ story to grotesque and half
impossible exceptions, or to heighten in
any way unusual characteristics. ThÂ«Â»
novelist has made minute and lovlns
studies of actual lowly life, seeking not
exceptions but typical figures.
The most successful humorist of this
latter group has been Sarah Orne Jewett.
whose sketches of life and character as
they are to be found In the humble vil
lages along the Maine coast stand at tho
head of one department of our literature.
Every picture la studied with conscien
tious care from models that the author
loves and thoroughly kn.ow-3. They stand
out like etchings every outline distinct,
every mark of individuality clearly drawn.
The humor lies in the lifelikeness. In tha
quaint, half-fantastic views and conceit*
of those who have seen life from only ono
pitiful standpoint, in the almost spontane
ous pathos which is never far distant in
any of her tales, and in the bright.
breezy, kindly personality of the author
herself. There is an Irresistible charm in
these limpid, artless tales of homely
lives; one cannot help smiling often over
their simplicity and their rude wisdom.
Two aged men. for Instance, at the win
ter hearth entertaining each other with
the mere nothings of Idle talk, might not
seem to be a humorous topic, yet how ab
solutely true to nature can she represent
them and how our hearts warm to then*
as ihey discuss the mysteries 'ot cider
maklnsr.
"I call that pretty cider." said Martin. " 'Tia
young yet. but it has gut some weight already,
and 'tis smooth. There Â» a* sight o' difference*
between good upland fruit aud the speshy
apples that grows in wet ground. An' 1 takd
it that bar 1 ! has an influence. Some bar'13
kind' of wilt elder and some smarten it uj>
and keep it hearty. Lord: what stun! so rut
folks are wlllln" to set before ye! 'Hain't wuth
the name o' cider, nor no better than tha
renstn's of a vinegar cask."
"And then there's weather, too." agreed Air.
Jacob Dyer, "had ought to be took into con
sideration. Git your apples Just in the right
timeâ not too early to taste o' the tree, nor
too lavs to tasts o' the ground, and Ju3t la
the Â»nap o' time as to ripeness, on a good
sharp day with the .sun a-ahining; have 'era
iato the press and what comes out is elder."
One can almost hear the old cronies
smacking their lips. This minute realism,
this constant watch fulness -for touches of
nature, theae little pictures of idiosyncra
sies and petty foibies never make us roar
in high giee, seldom make us laugh aloud,
but tney never fail to awaken that siient
laughter that warms the heart and makes
us glow with peace and good wiil toward,
all mtn.
In the skillful use of pathos Miss Jewett
has been surpassed by few who have used
our language. It Is never obtrusive, it la
never even remotely sentimental, it is al
ways seemingly spontaneous. Those who
can read such a story, tor Instance, as "A
Native of Winty" and not find their eyes
wet at the end will never be touched by
mere literature, and yet there is no tieato.
scene, no pitiful story of sickness or
wrong to childhood or innocence. It is
pathetic Just as all human life is pathetic.
What a world of true pathos in a singla
sentence like this: "You never get over
bein' a child long's you have a mother to
tfo to!"
A humorist of a far different type la
Frank R. Stockton, a novelist who defies
classification, almost analysis. He stun. .a
as a kind of antithesis to the group j...<t
discussed. He is confined by no bounds
of geography. His scenes are located In
regions unexplored and indeed undreamed
of save by their creator. His characters
seem real, yet- they are like none that we
have ever known in our earthly experi
ence. He is the humorist of "negative
gravity." in his world water flows uphill,
and human beings act precisely the oppo
site of what one might expect. One is
continually facing a paradox, yet so
plausible are the tales, so logical seem
ingly are all of their parts that one la
half-inclined to believe them even against
the testimony of his better judgment.
There have been during the present era
a few who have written really humorous
poetry, notably in the field of local studies
of character. Hay's "Jim Bludso" and
"Little Breeches" have become widely
known; so have Charles Follen Adams'
"Jacob Strauss." and Sam Walter Fos3
has depicted in homely, yet taking. verse3
tho humors of the rural New England,
Yr.nkee. Will Carleton, too. with his bal
lads of farm and city life, has had a wide
popularity. The two poets, however, who
have done the best humorous work are
doubtless Eugene Field and James Whit
comb Riley. Field excelled as the delin
eator of childhood especially on, its pa
thetic side. The most of his work Is
whimsical and merely corclc, but In a few
simple lyrics he has reached the borders
of the reerion occupied by such a master
even as Thomas Hood.
James ' Whltcomb Riley. "the Hoosler
poet," has done in verse what the novel
ists of locality have done in prose. His
homely versea have the universal stamp
upon them that makes them acceptable
both to the high and the low, the Ignorant
and the educated. There Is a simple lilt
ing Â¦ movement, an artless singsong
rhythm to them that makes them at oneÂ©
ratchy and popular, yet there Is a fidelity
to nature, a tenderness and a true humor
in them that raises them at once Into the
realm of real literature. Such lyrics as
"When the Frost Is on the Punkln."
"Tho Raggedy Man," "Griggsbys Sta
tion," "Knee Deep in June." are real mas
terpieces of humor. What could be more
true and hearty than his picture of the
autumn farm?
When the frost Is en the punkln and the fod
der's In the shock.
And you hear the kyourk and gobble of tho
strutttn" turkey cock.
And the clackin' of the grulneys. and the
duckln' of the hens.
And the rooster's hallylooyer as he tip-toes
i on the fence;
O. it's then's the times a feller la a-feelln" at
his b-?ft.
With the risln' sun to greet him from a night
of peaceful rest.
As he leaves the hous*. bareheaded, and goes
out to feed the stock.
When the frost Is on the punkln and the fod
der's In the shook.
But June is Just as joyous a season for
(ge light-hearted Jloosier singer:
. -Plague! ef the' ain't sompln' In
I Work 'at kind o' goes ag'in
My convictions.' â ton? about
Here In June especially!
Under some old auple tree,
Jes* a restln' through and through,
I could get alonar without
Noth!n' else at all to do
Only Jea a wlshln" you â¢
Was a-gettln' tbeie like me
And June' was eternity.
To survey so vast* a field as the> humor
of English and American literature within
the narrow limits of sltxeen brief papers
demands of a necessity that only typical
figures be Included within the plan. Many
there have been both In England and
America who have produced real humor,
some of It doubtless equal to any that we
have mentioned, yet it has been impossi
ble to include them all. The pioneer In
any field deserves the first and best re
ward and we have endeavored to give
such their true place in the evolution of
humor, and to omit no author who in any
way prominently assisted In developing
and enriching It., .

WASHINGTON, Feb. 1.â The House to
day passed an omnibus bill carrying 191
claims for stores and supplies taken by
the Union army during the rebellion. The
claims were passed on by the Court of
Claims " and aggregated $344,480. -Practi
cally air the beneficiaries reside In the
South, j Considerable opposition, to the
bill was displayed early.' In. the day un
der the -leadership of Cannon,, the
man of thÂ© Appropriation Committee, but
it flattened out later and : the. bill finally
was passed without division.
The bill to amend the Chinese . exclu
sion act, w'lth a view to preventing the
fraudulent entry of Chinese â¢ Into the
United States, was passed, as were other
bills of -minor Importance. -- . . ,
When the House convened -to-day some
minor; business was transacted by unani
mous consent.
Southard of Ohio, chairman of the Com
mittee on Coinage, Weights and Meas
ures, asked unanimous consent' to con
sider a bill to establish a "national stand
ardizing bureau," which should have cus
tody of the standards and furnish Infor
mation to any educational Institution,
firm, corporation or individual in the
United States. â¢:
After some discussion It was agreed that
the bill should be made a continuing or
der after the disposal of the bill to pro
mote the efficiency of the revenue cutter
service.
The Benate bill to appropriate $50,000 for
the purchase or construction of a reve
nue cutter for Boston harbor was passed.
The House later entered- upon the consid
eration of private bills. '
A bill to regulate the coming of Chinese
persons into the country' created some dis
cussion. Hitt, chairman of the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs, said the bill had
been prepared by the Attorney General to
prevent the fraudulent entry of Chinese
laborers by giving the Government, as
well as the Chinamen, the right to appeal
from the decision of the United States
Commissioner. Hltt said that he him
self did not believe the Chinese exclu
sion act was a just law, because It was
passed in violation of treaty rights, but
the law was on the statute books and it
was the duty of every, citizen to obey it.
The bill was passed.
This being private bill day, Mahon of
Pennsylvania, chairman of the Commit
tee on War Claims, called up the unfin
ished business, which was a bill- for the
relief of St.- John's I/)dge of Masons of

tee will consist of several hun
dred men.
Bishop Potter, it was said, had con
sented to start the movement, his advice
in the matter of mapping out the city and

It has been believed In some quarters
that the three cruisers could, not be built
within the limit of cost named by Con
gress. However, a calculation based on
the price to be paid for ; the unsheathed
armored cruisers would lend < to : disprove
this theory. The average cost of the three
unsheathed armored cruisers of 13 400 tons
trial displacement; and 22 knots SDeed H

this rate a crulner of ; 9700 tons * dlsDlace

than the ; amount* appropriated, namelv
$2,800,000. As about $100,000 will be required
for armor out of the sum appropriated it
has be<m necessary to eliminate certain
items from the ;â¢ specifications, as in the
case of the sheathed battleships/. Cramps'

BISHOP POTTER, THE EMINENT CIVIXE OP NEW YORK CITY, WHO
HAS AGREED TO ORGANIZE A BODY OF VIGILANTES TO WATCH
THE MUNICIPAL, GOVERNMENT.
NEW -YORK, Feb. 1.â Notable contribu
tions to anti-imperialistic .literature are
articles in the February number of tho
North American Review by Mark Twain
and former President Harrison. The first,
entitled V'To the Person Sitting In Dark
ness," is a savagely ironical review of the
present policy of the leading Christian
nations being pursued in China and of the
dealings of Great Britain with the Trans
vaal arid of the United States with the
Philippines. Ringing the changes upon
the phrase "extending the blessings of
civilization to our brother who sits in
darkness" the humorist warns us that,
though this has been a good trade in the
past and baa paid well, nevertheless in
the present day "the people who sit In
darkness are getting to be too scarceâ too
scarce and too shy.. And such darknes3
as is now left Is really of but ah indiffer
ent quality and not dark enough for the
game. Most of those- people who sit in
darkness have been furnished with more
light than was good for them or profit
able for us. We have been injudicious."
In short the business is being ruined, be
cause Mr. .McKInlev and Chamberlain and
the Kaiser and the Czar and the French
have been playing the game too openly
right in sight of tho heathen. Christen
dom "has been so eager to get every stake
that appeared on the" green cloth that the
people; who git in darkness have noticed
it and have begun to show alarm.. They
have become suspicious of the blessings
of civilization. More â they have begun to
examine them. This is not well. The
blesBings of civilization are all right and
good commercial property, there could not
be a betterâ In a dim light.
"In the case of friendless and oppressed
little Cuba." continues Twain, "the Pres
ident Inveighed against annexation and
declared it would be 'criminal aggression.'
This was but following our great tradi
tions but the shot was heard around the
world. The nations of the earth gave
heed and we were so proud of our Presi
dent. But presently came the Philippine
temptation. It was strong. It was too
Btrong and he made that bad mistake, he
played the European game â Chamberlain
game. It was a pity, it was a great pity,
that error, that one -grievous error, for
it was the very place and time to play
the American game again."
Â¦ Mr. Harrison's "musings" are far Ies3
ferocious than Mr. Clemens' outcries.
Indeed, by -the side of the latter our for
mer President seems gentle and almost
timid. But look closer and you will dis-.
cover the hand of Iron under a silken
glove. -Whatever -.we may think of its
political aspect has not the. veiled sar
casm in the following sentence a distinct
ive polemical value: "We are hearing now
a great deal of the riches and strategical
advantages which have come to us with ;
the docile acceptance of divine will In' the
Philippines.". . - â¢ , *
Dropping sarcasm Mr. Harrison- points
out that on this new d,octrlne of "equiva
lents," four great powers of Europe might
combine In a colonization in this hemis- j
phere.as they did in Africa and possess i
themselves of all the Central and South
American States unless the United States
gave Its powerful aid to the latter. He i
believes that it Is uf the highest conse- i
quence to us and to those Spanish-Amer
ican nations that it should be known to
them and to the world that the United
States will continue faithfully, and un
swervingly to respect the autonomy of
those States; that v/e will "neither our
selves dismember them nor suffer them
to be dismembered by â¢ any European
power. â¢

Clay asserted that his amendment was
in good faith ar.d that it was of great im
portar.ee to provide at the present session
for the construction of the Nicaragua
canal. After some further debate on the
amendment the Senate at C:10 adjourned.
Stewart argued that the tremendous ad
vantage.Great Britain held In ocean com
merce could not bo overcome by indi
vidual effort. The only way to break the
domination of Â«he s*-as by Europe was for
the United States Government to give its
Bblpptes the same advantages as those
enjoyed by foreign shipping interests.
It v.as agreed that the Senate assemble
at ?Ao a. ro. on Monday and proceed to

restraint of trade. ' ~ '?
Cay of Georgia offered an amendment
providing- for the acquisition from Costa.
Rica and Nicaragua of a route for the
isthm'an cf-naJ. This latter amendment
developed a spirited controversy between
Clay ami Chandler. The latter declared
I tnat many of the amendments Â¦ offered
were for the purpose of embarrassing and
defeating the measure.
Berry commented on the*~?act that all
who did not {.upport this bill were set
â¢lown . as Ignorant, and said he would
have Intrusted the framing of the bill to
a oommittf-e representing agricultural and
a'.l other classes rather than to a commit
tee composed of shipbuilding experts p*r-
Eonally inturcpt^d la 5ts benefits.
Tlilman proposed an amendment and
called for Its reading. It proved to be ex
tremely long and related to common car
riers. After, ten papes had been read the
amendment ms !aid aside temporarily to
l-frmit Stewart to make a speech In favor
of the Mil. Before Stewart began Allison
moved that when the Senate adjourn it be
until 11. a., ra. to-morrow, which was
apreed to without dtssent.
Frye Interrupted to state that in a bill
of this kind expert knowledge of the
h'clicst character was absolutely neces
sary, and he h?rd!y thought the'fram'ng

for a scssion-tÂ»e?1nnins at 11 a. m. to-mor

Toward the close of the day a spirited

SANTA ANA, Feb. l.-The heaviest hail
storm in eight years visited this valley
this afternoon. Neither oranges, lemons
nor celery were seriously injured by the
storm. To-night the snow is lower ln\the
foothills than for the past ten years and
a cold wind Is blowing from the north.
PRESCOTT. Ariz., Feb. 1.â Snow com
menced falling this forenoon and contin
ued at intervals till Just before dark,
when a blinding storm set in and has in
creased in fury since. At 8 o'clock to
night the ground Is covered to a depth of
six Inches, with prospects of the storm
continuing air night. This is the first
snow this winter, and as the total rainfall
prior to this storm was only two inches,
the snow is extremely welcome.
ORANGE, Cal., Feb. 1.â One of the
hardest hailstorms ever experienced In
this vicinity occurred this afternoon. In
a few minutes the ground was white and
snowballing was indulged in. The pre
cipitation was a quarter of an Inch in less
than half an hour. , *
has been falling desultorily for the last
two days turned to hail at 2 o'clock this
afternoon and Los Angelenos were treated
to a spectacle not often witnessed here.
The stones were very large and so soft
that many people insisted that it was
snow. The shower continued about five
minutes and the ground was completely
covered during the fall. It was appar
ently the last effort of the storm, for the
skies cleared immediately afterward and
the sun snone brightly. ~ Â¦
The rainfall in the foothills has been
four times what It *has been in the city.
Mountain streams are running and the
Cuyamaca reservoir is filled to the 17-foot
mark to-night. At Morena 1000 inches of
water is running over the dam. The
shower was from the ocean and was not
predicted by the weather service. . :

SAN DIEGO, Feb. 1.â Rain' has' fallen
to-day Jn most every portion of San Diego
County.: except- on the Colorado desert;
and to-night the air Is quite chilly for
San Diego, because of the fact that the
rain of the valleys and seacoast was snow
In the Julian and Cuyamaca mountains.
The snowfall at Julian amounted to five
inches uv to 6. o'clock this evening, while
higher up In the Cuj'amaca Mountains the
fall r/as fourteen inches. At both places
the snow was still falling and at both it
had been preceded by rain. In the city
the fall v.-as only .21 of- an Inch, making
4.03 inches for the season, as against 2.35
inches to the same date last year. The
prospect is for good "crops of wheat as

Speaking before a large audience at the
Cooper Medical, College last night. Pro
fessor; William Fitch Cheney branded the
public-' school ashore -. of the 'most active
disseminators \ of .disease in children
which, exists, in this- community. -As a
remedy he eUsgested regular daily medi
cal inspection of' each pupil, by which
means every. ailing orie could be weeded
out and sent -to Â¦ a hospital or home be
fore the conjaglon had time to spread.

among them. The speaker,' while making
no direct. reflection on the San Francisco
public schools, .contrasted", them â¢ with,
those in the East, In which the- hygiene
of the scholars is an essential. feature. .
The lecture was one of the scries of bi
weekly' Lane lectures, and ".the subject
was, "How ' to ' Prevent Disease in. Chil
dren." The' speaker divided his subject
into three divisionsâ heredity, children's j
surroundings And Improper food â making
valuable suggestions for radical reform In ;
all these. . â¢ .,. 1 i
Heredity was eaid by: the lecturer to be
a fertile cause of sickness in children, and
he saw no way out of this difficulty but
the regulation of marriages. Regular
hours,, regular, food and sanitary sur
roundings are Dr. Cheney's secondary de
slrerata for. the -rearing of Â¦> healthy chil
dren, but his most -original observation,
and one which made a visible sensation,
was that no attempt should be made to
train the mind of any child under 10 years
of age. Till that age, according to the
speaker, tha juvenile mind should He fal

EASTERN MAILS
ARE NOT DELAYED
Lillie Levy, a charming little miss, tal
ented, young and a native daughter, is the
latest* recruit to the vaudeville stage. She
will make her debut at Fischer's Concert
hall next Monday- night in an original
song and dance' specialty.
a.iIss Levy is well known to San Fran
ciscans through her clever interpreta
tions of character comedy given at many
local charity entertainments.
Miss Levy affords a striking example of
determination to succeed. She has worked
hard to perfect herself In her chosen pro
fession and well deserves whatever tri
umph the future holds for her.
Manager Fischer is enthusiastic when
he speaks of his protege and prophesies a
great success for her when she makes her
debut upon the stage of bis theater. .
Judge Murasky asked Mr. Wheeler what
was to be done in the case at bar when
the contest had been ' abandoned "before
the recount was complete, nineteen-, pre
cincts "yet remaining to be recounted.
Wheeler answered, that the court' must
take the number of votes credited to each
candidate by ._ the Election Commission
from,, the uncounted " precincts, as , prima
facie evidence that Â¦ the - numbers - were
correqt and add them .to the -corrected
figures on the court record; which, he
s-aid. would give- Costello the office by
u handsome' majority. Â¦ Wheeler further
contended that the contest could not be
abandoned after having been taken up
for hearing by tho court to the exclusion
of the right of his client to demand his
right under the code. â¢ . . . . . Â¦.
Graham's counsel pointed to what they
termed "fatal defects" In the theory of
the other side and quoted a portion of
Eection 1122 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure In support of their position. This
section provides that the court must.be
governed In the trial of contests by the
lules of law and evidence governing the
determination of questions of- law or
fact. Rules of law, they say, give either
side the right :to amend their pleadings,
frequently against the objection of the
other side, and always when the other
side ' consents. Daingerfleld's counsel
made the motion for leave to amend, It
is pointed out, and Graham's counsel con
sented. Now Costello, whom they "refer
red to as an Interloper, comes into court
and asks that they fee denied the right to
adhere to the usual forms of pleading
and practice and the rules of law. If one
candidate can do this, they conclude that
all candidates could do the same, which
would .result in endless confusion.
After being- thus informed Judgre Mu
rasky took the case under advisement
and announced to counsel that they
might expect an early decision.
Mr. Wheeler also, contended that even
though they were given the right to
amend their pleadings neither Dalnger
lield's nor Costello's counsel could accu
rately estimate the number, of votes
which would have legally been allowed
Costello, "and," said Wheeler, "we 1 assert
that even though this waa done that Cos
tello would still have a' handsome ma
jority, as a faithful tally of the records
disclosed."
Costello relies upon section 23 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, which provides
that at the end of the hearing of a contest
of election the court must declare"
the person receiving the highest number
of votes elected. As Costello was not a
party to the contest between Daingerfleld
and Graham, ballots upon which he was
voted for, even though they contained a
distinguishing mark or were otherwise
invalid, were not thrown out. Many hun
dreds of ballots were thrown out against
both Daingerfleld and Graham, with the
result that at the end of the recount Cos
tello was credited with. more votes," ac
cording to the figures of the Election
Commission, than either Daingerfield or
Graham, according to the court record.
Counsel for Costello claim that Dainger
fleld's act in crediting Costello with Hie
number allowed him by the Election Gom
mission in his pleadings, and' as evidence
established the accuracy of the number of
votes credited to him ; in the pleadings,
makes it prima-facie evidence of the fact
that such legal number of votes are .now
credited to Costello. Continuing on this
line Costello holds that as the records of
the court show that both Daingerfleld and
Graham have a smaller number of legal
votes, it is now too late for either of them
to Question the legality of the number
credited to him and preclude him from
the right to the office, by amending the
pleadings and crediting him with a smaller
number of votes than the Incumbent, Gra
ham.
On the other side Judge. Graham coun
seled with Attorneys Rlordan and kande,
who didn't "follow lines of reasoning to
their ultimate conclusion." as did-Whee
ler, but argued what they called "common
sense" and Justice. Judge Murasky was
evidently now very thoroughly impressed
with either the "ultimate conclusions" or
the "common sense," for it wasn't late in
the day when he ordered the matter sub
mitted and went to his . chambers In
search of law, or in its absence for a few
"treatises on justice" by learned jurists
on conditions of fact, though hardly par
.allel and as fully tangled as those in
volved in. the case at bar.
In the absence of authorities, Supreme
Court theories or common law precedents,
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler. ex-Judge
William T. Wallace and Barclay Henley
sought yesterday by means of various
shades and degrees of* reasoning to con
vince Superior Judge Murasky that Ste
phen V. Costello now stands in the eye
of the law as the legally elected candidate
for the office of Superior Judge, in the
stead and place of either Judge William
R. Daingerfleld or. Judge Thomas F. Gra
ham. AVheeler did the arguing on, behalf
of Costello, Judge Wallace lent s'trength
to the same with .his venerable presence
and Henley looked as mad as though op
position to the motion was worthy of
naught but his contempt.

COSTELLO'S CASE
AWAITS JUDGMENT
Josephine Smith, whose initial effort as

herself a failure. Her husband's lawyer
and the court knew this before Mrs.
Smith saw fit to .make the confession, but
It Is not for the purpose- of supporting

the affidavit, but in an effort to secure
another le^al round or two with her
husband before finally abandoning him
to the ccmtentroent of a .grass widower's
life, which he now enjoy?. . Â¦
Mrs. Smith has secured an attorney and |
has moved for another trial of the action

ground of extreme : cruelty. In support
of her motion for a new trial. Mr*. Smith

' "Shortly after her relations with At- j

Here Mrs, Smith begins her attack. Con

him how long: it would take for him to;

Walker answered that it would take \
giboot twenty minutes, whereupon the j
â¢ art ordered the case continued until I

Foshay Walker. He invited her Into his

had to contend with, and concluded by
Mrs. Smith avers, that at one

Walker, she further says, told her to send
a letter to Judge Dalng-erfield telling him
that she was ill and desired a continu

Acting en this -advice she did send a let

Foreign Markets.
NEW YORK. Feb. 1.â Bradstreefs to-morrow
will say:
Business as a v whole has been of a larger
volume this week. Cold and stormy, weather
has unquestionably stimulated retail business
In boots, shoes, rubber goods and clothing, and
this has aided in lightening the stocks carried
by retailers as a result of mild weather here
tofore. More has been doing, too, in wholesale
lines on scrinsr account, and business in this
respect is classed as fair. Â¦ Reports are rela
tively best from the West and South, from
which sections advices are that the total Janu
ary, business compares well with a year ago.
The contrary is reported from leading 'Eastern
markets, however, and the aggregate done here
has not by far equaled expectations. Trade
collections as a whole are fair, the only com
plaint coming from Motions where mild
weather has Interfered, with the distribution of
heavy goods. Foundry plglron is lower at all
leading markets, but on the other hand Besse
mer Is rather firmer, while steel billets actu
ally nell for 25 cents more per ton, and there
is talk of an advance of $1 per ton. In finished
products wire and wire nails are $2 up. The
weakness in foundry grades is chargeable to
large buyers, who having satisfied their. early
wants, now are holding aloof, and to reports
that Btocks are Increasing. A sale of 1000
tons is leported closed at the concessions
noted. Export trade In crude forms Is prac
tically dead, but In finished lines a good busi
ness is still doing In railway material, ex
amples of which are shipments of locomtlvea
to France. Â»teÂ«l rails to Mexico and South
Africa and steel billets '.to England. Heavy
calls- for pipe are reported from the new oil
district In Texas. .The labor outlook has been
helped by the compromise between the valley
furnace operators and their men. -
Wheat, including flour,' shipments for the
week were 3.77S.100 bushels, against 4.83S.877
bushels last week, 2,742,937 bushels in the
corresponding week of 1900 and 6,585,413 bushels
In 189ft. From July 1 to date this season wheat
exports are 115,957,863 bushels, i against 120,119,
935 bushels last season, and 150.187.659 bushels
in 1898-99.- Â¦
Failures' In the United States for the last
week of January number 233, as against 281
last week. 171 In this week a year ago and
207 in 1899. Canadian failures for the week
number 27. as compared . with 34 last week, 31
'In this week a year ago and 26 In 1899.
CHICAGO, Feb. 1.â Wheat was dull and easy
at the opening under the Influence of easy
cables, liberal receipts and heavy Argentine
shipments. May opened ?6c lower at 76Â»i@76',ic,
with considerable pressure on the market from
both local and outside interests. Early reports
of export sales turned the market, however.
Shorts became frightened and covered, with
the result that May rallied to 76%c. On the
bulge prcflt-taklng became the order of busi
ness, but the close was steady, May US*^
higher at 76c.
Corn was quiet, with the trade mostly local
and without features. May cloasd HtPVaC
higher at 33Hc.
The trade In oats was very light- and the
market Independent, responding neither to the
early weakness nor to the late strength of
wheat and corn. May oats closed H'Ef'ic higher.
Provisions were dull, closing fairly steady.
May pork closed a shade lower; lard and ribs,
2V4c higher.

Bradstrcet's Financial Review.
NEW TORK.' Feb. 1.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will *ay:' Renewed strength
was shown In the stock market this week In
spite of the fact that the much-talked-of and
long-expected deal In' regard to the St. Paul
road proved to have been more or less a myth
and that the action of the American Steel and
Wire directors on Tuesday resulted In vir
tually suspending action as to the dividends
on the stocks and left the prospect in that
connection a mattar of doubt. Further gold
shipments to Paris were made on Thursday to
the. amount of $2.3110,000 and the continued rise
of exchange forced the conclusion that gold
will go to London, the position of the Bank of
England, as shown by Its weekly statement of
Thursday, showing that It is In need of rein
forcement for Its specie reserves. Money, how
ever, has continued to come to New York from
the interior, and Wall street. In view of last
Saturday's good bank statement and the favor
able one which In also expected to-morrow, ap
parently concluded that money will remain
easy and plentiful and that gold shipments
will do no harm, while they will improve the
position at Ixmdon and lead to a more active
interest in American stocks developing there.
DOMINION OF CANADA.
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Feb. l'.â Fluctuations In the
stock market to-day were very pronounced in a
number of cases and professional operators
were successful in reviving bullish interest
practically as they saw fit. They resorted to
palpable manipulation at times in order to ac
quire a following, and after successfully bid
ding up a leading group realized on their hold
ings and began anew In another quarter. As a
result the market displayed at one time or
another pronounced strength in every division.
To what extent, if any, the public figured In
to-day's movements remains conjectural. Re
ports of combinations of various properties con
tinued to be heard, thereby Increasing Interest
in the minor stocks, which assumed consider
able jromlnence in to-day's proceedings. Later
lu the day a report was current that Union
Pacific had secured control of the Southern Pa
cific. No official confirmation could be had of
this statement, but the fact that the market
for Union Pacific boiled for a time, with 'the
stock rising 4Vi points on transactions of 225,000
chares, was sufficient In Itself., according to the
views of the traders, as being authoritative. It
was admitted that a leading .Interest In South
ern Pacific had sold out to a syndicate, pre
sumably representing Union Pacific. This an
nouncement, coming on top of the varied reports
abcut Impending dividends, extraordinary earn
ings, trade combinations' and so on, which were
rl:e enrly in the day. threw the market into
clyinsed hands with as little hesitation as if
thej* were fractional lots. At the outset the Im
provement In prices which gradually gained
t-trength iras assisted by the higher range of
prices from London. foreign houses bought
early, but subsequently unloaded about 100,0yo
shares of Southern Pacific. That stock strength
ened somewhat after the London selling had
ceased end was practically about the only issue
which did not have a bull following. During the
general selling toward the cloee.lt sagged to
46>4. compared with 49U. the opening figure.
A factor which was Instrumental In advancing
the market to-day was the lack of any gold
engagements for to-morrow's steamer to Eu
rope. The market Tor sterling exchange was
called easier this week, demand bills selling
at 44 87%.
Ths forecast of to-morrow's bank statement
Indicates a ;nin in cash ri. S 1.500. 000, exclusive
of the probable addition to this fipure by Gov
ernment disbursements for Interests, the Sub-
Trrasury to-day having a debit balance of
$l,346,J4j at the clearing-house on this account.
The gold exports' this week of t2.334.000 wÂ«re
entirely offset by the movement of money from
the interior, the net gain of u-s account being
13,538,000. Recurring to the stock market, profit
taking became quite general In the late dealings
and material inroads were made on the highest
prices'of the day in some stocks. On the other
hand there were points of renewed strength and
the market closed, very animated and irregular.
Importar.t advances were made In many prom
inent bonds to-day and exceptional gains were
made of GVi and 7 points, respectively., in Peo
ria and Eastern incomes and Central of Georgia
first incomes. The aggregate transactions
footed Op the exceptional figure of $7,235,000.
United States 3s coupon declined Â»4 per cent
on the last call. The stock market this week
has been largely In the hands of. professional
traders of abundant resources, and while the
general demand from â¢ the outside public for
stocks has been rather languid the professionals
have been able to manipulate prices at will.
The contest thus Involved of skill and alertness
on the floor of the Stock Exchange has caused
an erratic and Irregular market and consider
able show of activity, but It la doubtful whether
there has been much actual transfer of stock
ownership.
Circumstances indicate that In more than one
case the advance in the price of a stock hod
been part of a plan to frustrate an Intended
purchase for control. It Is the belief In Wall
street that nidi plans are held in abeyance on
account of the level of prices which has been
at present attained In the stock market and
would be tenaciously followed up at a most fa
vorable opportunity, although the officially
sanctioned assertion that the fit. Paul deal was
off somewhat chilled this coandence. the
later announcement of the proposition for
transfer of control of Mobile and Ohio to the
Southern Railway revived that confidence, as 11
indicated the continued pursuit of plans of con
solidation and the transfusion of ownership o*
railroad properties by the same financier who
has been the moving spirit In the attempted
Northwestern amalgamation and in the anihra
clte field. The strength showed by -the steel
stocks in the face of the week's developments
has somewhat allayed the recent uneasliWs
over the future of the properties represented by
these 6tock*. The stat?ment Issued by the Bteel
and Wire Company was not regarded as reas
suring as to the trade conditions disclosed, and
the Iron Ajre frankly admits a' disposition to
halt in the trade. Some apprehension continues
to exist concerning the final settlement of dis
putes at Issue between the powerful combina
tions in the trade.
As to* the money market the outflow of gold
is regarded with equanimity, as It Is withdrawn
from a fairly plethoric market. The course of
the foreign exchanges during the week shows
the increaeed force of I^ondon's attraction for
BOt* con.pared with Paris. Indicating the satls
factle of Paris' larc<? claims in London The
ir.atntersnce of the Bank of England's discount
rate ai S per cent this week. In spite of the
large recuperation already effected In Its re-
ponrcet. and Its continued borrowing: from the
market In face of the market's demand upon
It for leans, shows Us purpose to attract cold
to London from New York. This policy, of
course, has In xiew the coming flotation of the
Hrltlsh war loan. Estimates as to the slie of
this loan run as higrh as {250.000.000 to 1300 000 -
000. The increase of the. 1 Sank of England's re
serves during January has been entirely from
domestic sources and It Is evidently considered
necessary, to increase the pold reserves witWn
the kingdom before attempting to float the war
loan.
liuslneFs In railroad bonds has been large and
at advanced prices.
The abundance and cheapness of money has
thrown investment funds into the bond market
United States 3s advanced U per cent and new
4s >Â» per cent over the call price of a week ago.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
billets, plates and structural materials. All
those lines show a brisk demand. Wire nails
and barbed Â¦ wire were advanced $2 per ton;
owing to heavy orders .from the West, and It
is expected that the few mills still idle will
shortly resume. Activity Â¦ in Texas oil fields
had an influence on the sales of tanks and
pipes. Wages are in a fair way to be satis
factorily adjusted | at valley furnaces. The
reduction agreed upon is less than originally
announced. Export orders decreased and the
armor plate contract may not go to an Ameri
can, althoush his terms were the best.
A sudden Increase In sales of wool at the
three chief Eastern markets to 5,412.000 pounds,
against 2,893.400 pounds in "the previous week,

unusually dull season some recovery was in

week of 1896, which was the smallest aggre

Harrison's circular says: "Durtn* thÂ» week
there have been two arrivals of coal from
Washington. 6720 tons: two from Ore
gon, 103O tons; three from British Colum
bia. 10.370 tons; total. IS. 620 tons. The arrivals
this week are somewhat less than the amount
called for. hence the stocks In yard are betas
depleted. The demand for steamer uses U
quite large, and steam coals ara being: freely
sold as fast as same arrive. The- steamer* now
plying to Australia, Honolulu and the Orient
are much larger fuel consumers than In former
years, so that the difference is markedly felt.
The winter demand for house uses Is up to
the average, although the number of g-as stovea
for cooking and house heating: is being in
creased annually. The local coat market Is
now being controlled absolutely by the coast
production, and their sway Is Â«o supreme that
It cannot be interfered with, as It was prior
to two years ago. Then Australian established
fuel values, but for the . moment Newcastle
coal has advanced three shillings, and Is un
procurable at the advance for several months
to come, as SO per cent of their output for
shipment goes to the west coast, hence Aus
tralian cargoes, to save the Importer from loss,
have to sell at full figures. New oil discoveries
are belnr reported weekly, even as contiguous
to the 'city as San Pablo: this meana low
priced fuel, when consumers will shape thera
selvee for Its use later on."

The practice of ordering the payment of

W. AV. 'Campbell to direct the expedition
to Sumatra to observe the total eclipse of
the sun in April. The sun's disk will be
wholly -obscured for tsix and a half min

the opportunities for photographing the
corona and making spectroscopic observa

This scientific undertaking has been
made possible through the generosity of
William H. Crocker of San Francisco, who
will defray all expenses.

ALAMEDA, Feb. 1.â It would be worth
$10,000 to her husband, says Madame^An
nette Harbidge-Maristany, to prove"*that
one of her former husbands, Benjamin
Freimann, is either .dead or alive, not
realizing that if he were proven alive she
would be a bigamist. The former hus
band, dead or alive, according to her
statement, is worth many thousands in
Egyptian money. Joseph Marlstany, who
is suing Madame Annette Harbidge-Maris
tany. alleges that he was deceived when
he married her, because, he claims, she
already had a husband. For these rea
sons, he further avers, all the transfers
of his property to her are illegal.
Madame Harbidge-Maristany says Mr.
Freimann left her five years ago to look
after his share in his mother's $250,000 es
tate in Egypt. She has not seen him -since
and thinks he was murdered and robbed
of $1500 by the celebrated assassin Butler
of Australia. She denies looting her pres
ent husband's estate, and insists that If it
had not been for her his property would
have all gone to sharks.

Recruits Alexander Martin of 'A Com

A Berious case is that of Recruit J. Mar
tin of G Company. Second Provisional
Battalion, who was arrested yesterday
and charged with stealing Government
property. He was seen to enter the tent
of the first sergeant of his company, and
upon the return of the latter he reported
the loss of five army revolvers, valued at
$15 each. As the sergeant is responsible
for the property he lost no time In report
ing the theft, and the Investigation that
followed led to thÂ« arrest of Martin.
The charge is such a serious one that it
was pot deemed advisable to confine the
prisoner In the tent guardhouse at the
camp, and he was sent to the brick prison
at the fort. â¢ . >

When Meyer made the contract with
the town he had the Pacific Surety Com
pany give a bond for Its fulfillment. The
Trustees have decided, to begin proceed
ings against the surety company. They
have notified the company that the town
has been without street lights since Jan
uary 14, and that the company under the
terms of the bond guarantees the comple
tion of the contract.
The lighting of the town will probably
be given to the Livermore Water and
Power Company when it shall have In
stalled an electric plant. Until that la
done the town will remain in darkness,
because there is no available source of
current supply.
It is all due to a fight between promo
ter P. Meyer and his creditors. Meyer
contracted to light the town with elec
tricity. He bought a gas engine from the
Union Gas Engine Company of San Fran
cisco for $2000. but did not code within
*Â«Â» or $S0O of paying for it.
The company wearied of long delay and
then brought a suit, attached the engine
and at last had it removed. As soon as
the engine was taken out no more elec
tricity could be generated and the streets
and the private residences that depended
on the current for illumination were
dimmed.
Livermore is in darkness. The town
electric lights have been turned off and

learning in California ar.il on the Pacific Coast.
The time bavin* been too short to raise th*
permanent endowment for these fellowships I
am authorized to tender you the amount of six

the first year's stipend and one hundred dollars
to provide such acquisitions as the Semitic Li

stated will be forthcoming from year to year,
until the requisite endowment of fifteen thou

I have the honor to Inclose herewith my check

Interesting Ceremonies in "Which
British Subjects, Join. .
MONTEREY. Feb. 1.â British subjects
resident hereabouts, the officers and men
of British merchantmen now in this port
and many of the leading citizens of Mon
terey and Pacific Grove united to-day in
paying tribute to the memory , of Eng
land's Queen." The services were held to
day because two of the vessels participat
ing are obliged to leave before the hour
appointed for the royal funeral to-mor
row. Both of the vessels â the San Diego,
Captain Blackstead, and the Umbriur,
Captain. Hahnâ have been at sea since
Christmas,- and. Â¦- not. having heard of the
Queen's death, came into port here yester
day with .flags flying mast high. The
grief of their men' upon .hearing the sad
news was touching and was striking
proof of the place the late Queen held in
the hearts of all of her subjects.
At 1:30 to-day a procession of boats from
all the 'ships" in the harbor, headed by a
purple-draped, barge containing the- Fire
Department band, started from the outer
most vessel, and, passing slowly around
all the â¢ others, drew up â¢ to the wharf,
where the funeral parade was formed:

Englishmen, officers and men from the

of Monterey and Hobart Chetwood of Pa

of the English church was read. Dr.
McGowan â¢ made a brief address, expres
sive of the mourning ''throughout- ; the
world for the great and grand woman who
had departed, and emphasizing the fact
that America, next to England, would feel
her loss. The church, Â¦was beautifully

"Sir Robert Peel in the early days of his
career as a statesman was not a friend

Duke of Cambridge were the cause of the
change in Peel's attitude, the public ut
terances of the Duke of Cambridge bring
ing, to him a realization of our value as
English citizens. When Xathaniel Roths
child was admitted to the peerage all
questions as to ,the standing of the Jew
in England were answered. Rothschild
was allowed to take his oath on a Hebrew
Bible and to eliminate the objectionable
words in the oath. Such actions stand
as a monument to English love of jus
tice."
Rabbi Nieto also addressed his congre
gation on the close 'of the Victorian era
and the Justice administered to the Jew
ish race during the life of the noble
Queen. The rabbi followed the treatment
of the Jews In England, saying: "The his
tory of our race In England during the
last sixty years is a tribute to the great
ness of Queen Victoria. Some say she was
good rather than great, but I say she was
greater than all. for she subordinated her
private desires for the good of the people
under her."

COWES. Feb. 1.â The pathos of the
thought Inspired lost nothing by a scru
tiny of the King. Mis features were
teared and bore the marks of grief. But
In all that assemblage there will ever
stand out one faceâ that of the German
Emperor. Its tanned, almost olive con
tours were turned fiercely toward the sun
and his mustache-brushed upper lip en
hanced the firmness of his chin. It was
apparent that the Emperor was under
going a mental strain, for his face
twitched nervously. "Every inch a King,"
was the manner in which the German
Emperor was referred to.
Almost behind hlM ..Majesty was young
Duke Arthur of Connaught, perfect in
figure and with a handsome face, quiver
ing mouth and nervous movements.
Hardly was there time to recognize the
individuality of these personages, includ
ing the tawny-bearded Prince Henry of
Prussia and the clean-cut face of the.
Duke of Connaught.-before the most truly
pathetic sight of the day came in view.
It was a simple lltile band, in black, for
all the world like the sisters of some re
ligious order mourning humbly for one of
their number who had passed away.
None was distinguishable from the others.
They all wore plain black dresses with
long crape veils, and they followed meek
ly and with downcast heads. Yet the fir3t
was the Queen of England, and with her
was the woman wno. if she lives, will
also hold the proud title, and behind them
walked the woman to whom every knee
in England, however noble, Is bowed in
courtesy.

WILC0X CHARGED
WITH TREASON
Policemen Thomas J. Fitzpatrick and
John McMullin. who were on duty at the
fire, are reported missing T.o-day.
NEW YORK, Feb. 1.â The extent of the
destruction wrought by the conflagration
which destroyed nearly the whole block
of buildings at Thirty-first street and
First avenue last night, and did,'accord
ing to first estimates, J1.5C0.000 of dam
age, could be better appreciated this
morning. The huge factory of the Wil
liam Wicke Company was almost level
wiih the ground. Contractor Joseph Cody^
of the building department, with a force
of 100 men. had labored at the ruins all
night, pulling down dangerous sections of
wall. Other property destroyed was the
six-story factory building, Nos. 404, 406
and 408 East Thirty-second street; the
five-story tenement at 546 and &48 First
avenue; the five-story tenement, 462 East
Thirty-first street; Jackson's Iron foundry,
extending from 402 East Thirty-first street
to the river, and a two-story brick build
ing on Thirty-nrst street occupied by the
Swift Dressed Beef Company.
The property partially destroyed In
cludes the tenements at 530 and 652 First
avenue and 522 and 524 First avenue.
About seventy families were rendered
homeless by the burning of these tene
ments.
Boekhout's lumber yard on the north
side of Thirtieth street, between First
avenue and the river, was still burning
fiercely at 7 o'clock this morning, but the
iiremen with three powerful streams from
the nreboat and two streams from engine
No. 1 were able to keep the flames from
extending at that point.
Klre Chief Croker said to-day that he
believed the fire was caused by an explo
sion of chemicals in the Wicke factory.
He T.as informed that a watchman had
gone into the vault in the cellar with a
light, and that the vault contained the ex
plosives. The Chief added that he did not
know what had become of the watchman,
or who he was. He said the explosion
that started the conflagration might have
been caused by illuminating gas getting
into the cellar from a pas main, but he
did not think this was the case.
Engine 21 was almost completely
wrecked and water tower Xo. 3 was badly
damaged. Engine ST. on its way to the
fire, collided with a car at Fourteenth
street and Third avenue. Both tho car
and the engine were damaged, and the fire
horses were so badly hurt that one of
them had to be shot. Engine 25, on its
way from the fire to Its headquarters this
morning, broke down. The Fire Depart
ment also lost several thousand feet of
hose and connections. The bitter cold
made the work of the firemen very diffi
cult.

MISSING AFTER
THE BIG FIRE
Catherine Hermann . has sued Adam
Mertz and his wife, her aunt and uncle,
for $10,000 damages, alleging that they
turned her out of doors after inducing her
to leave her home at Columbia, Pa., and
come to them to become the heiress to a
portion of their fortune. 'Â¦ TT '
The Mertz residence Is at 233. Haste
street, Berkeley. They deny the charges,
declaring that their niece voluntarily left
them three months ago without telling
them where she was going.
The girl asserts that she was forced by
ill-treatment to go away and now she is
working in a laundry instead of living like
a lady while waiting for a. fortune. â¢ --
Miss Hermann is 24 years old. She
claims that her elderly relatives wanted
a companion and made all sorts of prom
ises to her, w lch. she complains, have
not been fulfllltu. After a month of hap
piness, Miss Hermann declares, she was
forced to go tb work as a domestic to earn
enough to pay taxes on tho Mertz home.
Later, she claims, her aunt turned her
out to make her way alone in a strange
city. She asserts that it was understood
she was to be the helres3 of the aged
couple. She asks for a permanent allow
ance of $20 monthly during their lifetime
and at death the reversion of their estate
to her, or $10,000 damages In lieu.
Mr. and Mrs. Mertz are each S2 years
of age. * Mr. Mertz is .confined to his bed
with illness. Mrs. Mertz Is quite deaf
and is compelled to use an ear trumpet.
She said .to-night:
"About five months ago njy niece ar
rived here. I Three months ago she left
of her own free will and without cause.
She did nothing but read and walk around
the streets while she was here. She and
her father were trying to arrange things
so that she could get our property when
we die. I have a letter which her father
wrote to her asking her to see if we
would legally adopt her. Had she be
haved herself she could have had what
we left"

WOODLAND, Feb. l.âThe- recount; of
the votes in all the precincts' in the
Fourth Supervisorial District in the Nel
son-Vaughn' contest was completed yes
terday. When- the recount .of the
last precinct commenced Vaughn had
a -net gain of 4 votes, which guvÂ© him
a plurality of, 8 vote3. In "West Woodland
Nelson made a net gain of 10 votes, which
gave him a plurality of 2 votes. Vaughn's
attorneys: are making. an effort ,to,over
come this by â¢ an attempt to show .. that
certain voters registered In one precinct
voted , in another. The, question, involved
Is whether a voter can be disfranchised
by an error of the registering officer. The
presiding : Judge. Angellottl of ~" Marln
County, Is a Republican. Vaughn is a
Republican and Nelson a Democrat. Tho
vote as canvassed by the election officers
gave Vaughn a plurality of 4 votes. The
court rejected -276 votes â about one-fourth
of the total cast. Neither side is satisfied
with the rullngSfOf the court and it is
probable that an appeal "will be taken, no
matter who wins.

{"California lemons are fast supplanting
the foreign fruit," said he, ."and It will
not be long before the lemons of this
State will control the entire Eastern mar
ket. We have already gone so far East
ward that the foreign lemon seldom
reaches as far "V\fest as Omaha, and lt
will not be many years before they will
disappear <from St. Louis and Chicago.
This is the first year that pur fruit has
gone Into the big markets of the far East
and the better appearance of the Califor
nia product, Â¦ together with the fact that
our lemon carries a much larger per cent
of juice than' does the Imported fruit, is
going to establish, our lemons wherever
they are put. Â¦â¢Â¦'-.
"There is no longer that prejudice In
the big Eastern markets of New York
and Boston against the California product
that there was. It is the fine looking.
Juicy fruit which Is winning the country
for us. I feel certain that a few years
more will give us the full control of the
market, because of the superiority of our
goods. There is a population of practi
cally 100,000,000 to supply, and the fear of
overproduction is. foolish. â¢ We will harve
a market for all that the trees can carry."
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 1.â In :, an, interview
regarding the Eastern market, for Cali
fornia lemons R. C. . Allen, one of .the
prominent growers of this , county, said
the California product Would soon /stop
the foreign lemon from coming Into* the
American market. ; Mr. Allen has just re
turned from a six weeks', trip through the
East. Â¦ " Â¦Â¦â¢;Â¦Â¦.': .' ' 'Â¦â¢ â¢ -;V^T^

FATHER YORKE'S LECTURE
ON PEISON OF THE POPE
Advance Sale of Tickets Assures the
Presence of a Large Audi
ence.
The advance sale of tickets for the
lecture by Rev. Father Yorke on the
"Prison of the Pope" warrants the belief
that the "capacity of Metropolitan Hall
"rfin be taxed next Thursday evening-.
The desire to hear this brilliant priest
discourse on a subject with which he is
eo familiar caused hundreds to apply for
tickets of admission. The funds realized
by the lecture are to help defray the cost
of erecting a church in the parish pre
sided over by Rev. Father Brady. The
proposed new building: is to be dedicated
to St. John the Evangelist and is to be
situated on St. Mary's avenue, opposite
old SL Mary's College. A parochial resi
dence has already been erected in the
parish and It Is expected that the funds
realized through Father Vorke'a lecture
will enable the zealous priest to at least
mako a start on the sacred edifice.

There seems to be little doubt that
General lilies will retain his present rank
and the command of the army. Friends
of Major General Chaffee. who holds a
volunteer commission, are anxious that
he shall be promoted to the grade of
major general, but as there are only four
vacancies In that grade the impression
prevails that they will go to Brigadier
Generals J. F. Wade, Just ordered to
Manila, H. C. Merriam, S. B. M. Young
and Arthur MacArthur. leaving General
"William Ludlow senior brigadier general.
The President will appoint several offi
cers brigadier generals and then re
tire them, including General Theodore
Schwan, assistant adjutant general;
Colonel A. S. Daggett, Fourteenth In

ARMY CHANGES
CONTEMPLATED
India Is rich in coal, though little min
ing has as yet been done in that country.
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Education yesterday that there is noth
ing In the charter to prevent Justice of
the Peace Daniels from continuing' in
his position as teacher in *he Lincoln
Evening School. The charter , prohibits
the holding of two salaried offices under
the city government, but Lane holds that
a teacher's position being legally the sub
ject of contract and not an office, it fol
lows that a school teacher is not a sal
aried officer under the city or any officer
at all. It does not follow that a teacher
may occupy two positions which conflict
with each other as to duties or hours of
employment, but there appears to be no
such conflict between the duties of a Jus
tice of the Peace and a teacher under ex
isting regulations.
May Hold Two Positions.
SAYS THE EIGHT^-HOtTB
LAW IS BEINQ VIOLATED
Xabor Commissioner Meyer Files
Charges Against Alcatraz Com
pany With Board of Works.
Commissioner Meyer of the State Labor
Bureau filed a statement with the Board
of Public Works yesterday, in which he
alleges that the Alcatraz Asphalt Com
pany, which has the contract to repave
Grant avenue, has been working Its men
over eight hours a day in violation of the
charter and the State law. If the allega
tions are proven the company is In dan
ger of losing Its contract. â¢
According to Meyer's statement, six
men employed at the mixing plant of the
company were forced to work from -6
a. m. until 4 p. m. on January 29, and
next day were informed that they would
be paid by the hour at the rate of 20
cents. | The men remonstrated and were
tolÂ« to quit.
The adjustment of the difficulty la not
within the province of the Board of
Works, according to Secretary Park. He
says that all the board can do Is to de
clare the contract violated, as It calls for
eight hours' labor and $2 per day wages.
The only recourse the" laborers have is
to enjoin the Auditor from paying the
company's demand for the contract price.
The board received two bids for repair
ing Sacramento, Clay and Washington
streets between Montgomery and San
some with bitumen or asphalt. The Ctty
Street Improvement Company bid 55146 05
for bitumen and $5790 12 for asphalt. The
San Francisco Construction Company bid
for bitumen $7353 32 and for asphalt
Â¦$7782 70. The board will award the con
tract and select the kind of pavement next
I Monday. . Â¦;? . V
duca the study of 'Caesar* in the high
school course?" The study is now begun
in the first year, but some of the teachers
present argued in favor of beginning it
in the second year on account of the diffi
culty encountered by the pupil in certain
passages.
The second topic was "Whether it would
not be preferable to require an entrance
examination into the university than to
continue the present syBtem of accredit
ing high schools." Some teachers . con
tended that the system had outlived its
usefulness, but the majority favored its
continuation, as to do away with It would
lessen the Intellectual standing of high
schools.
After two hours had been pleasantly
passed In this manner Mrs. Kincaid, as
slated by the Misses Jeffers, served coffee
and sandwiches to the assembled guests,
and so concluded a new departure which
Is likely to be regarded with a feeling of
pleasure by every teacher in the depart
ment. The representatives of the four
high schools who were present at Mrs.
Kincaid's initial function follow:

high school principals and teachers were
the recipients of Mrs. Kincaid's hospi
tality, which will be extended semi
monthly throughout the year until all the
1051 teachers in the department will have
been similarly entertained.
Mrs. Kincaid greeted the fifty or more
guests with her usual charm of manner
and explained that she had Inaugurated
the plan to have pedagogues meet to

Besides indulging in social converse the

Dr. J. Ellis Rodley, former Mayor of
Chleo, who is now under sentence of
tweJve years' imprisonment at Ban Quen
tin.. for perjury, was made the central flg
urÂ« In a drama of real life enacted by
oflicers of the law yesterday. An effort
was made by officials of Butte County to
land Rodley behind the walls of the-peni
tentiary regardless of red tape. That the
plan failed is due to the efforts of Attor
ney George D. Collins, who recently came
Into the case.
Dr. RcxJLey was convicted In February
a. yrar ago of having given false testi
mony in the contest over the will of Al
fred Fuller, a Butte County miser, who
died leaving an estate valued at $40,000.
Mrs. Minnie Houseworth, who served him
a* a nurse during his last illness, pro
duced a will naming her as legatee. A
Jury decided the will to be a forgery, and
Dr. Rofiley. who swore that F*uller told
him a. 6hort time prior to his death that
be had left his estate to Mrs. Houseworth,
was indicted for perjury and forgery. He
was convicted of the former charge and
acquitted of forgery. Mrs. Houseworth.
who was indicted on similar charges, Is
still awaiting trial. After the Supremo
Court had denied a motion for a new trial
on the perjury charge. Dr. Rodley secured
the services of Attorney Collins. A mo
tion, was made for a rehearing, and on
Tuesday last was denied by the Supreme
Court. Attorney Collins at once applied
to the United States Supreme Court for
a writ of error, claiming that his client
had not been granted all of the rights
awarded him under the constitution. A
â¢writ of Kupersedeas was Issued from the
United States Supreme Court Wednesday
and the necessary notice of the issuance
of the writ, which stays all proceedings
pending a hearing, was served by Collins
on the proper officers.
Judge Gray of Butte County, before
â¢whom Rodley was tried, directed Sher
iff Wilson Thursday afternoon to take
his prisoner to San Quentin. Sheriff WI1
eon followed instructions and made prep
arations to hurry Rodley to the peniten
tiary. Rodley, however, learned of this
plan and through a friend managed to
eend a dispatch to Collins Thursday
night Informing him of the scheme. Rod
ley was hustled out of bed at 3 o'clock
yesterday morning and taken from the
County Jail at Oroville. An hour later
he was on board the down train for this
city en route to San Quentin. Attorney
Collins was in the meantime working to
checkmate the plans of the Butte offi
cials. He had the necessary papers drawn
up when the State Supreme Court met
yesterday morning to ask for and be
granted a writ of habeas corpus by Chief
Justice Beatty. Armed with the writ. Col
lins hurried to the Sheriff's ofnee and
tSherifT Lackmann detailed Deputy Sheriff
Murphy to accompany Collins and serve
the writ on Sheriff Wilson. Among the
first passengers â¢ ta i eaV e the ferry boat
wore Wilson and" Itodley. The former was
trying to get out through a side entrance
when Deputy Murphy served the writ of
habeas corpus on him.
"What do 1 care for those papers?" ex
claimed Wilson. -'I have been instructed
to take this prisoner to San Quentin
prison azid I .am going over with him.
You can't stop me."
"1 don't want to have any trouble," re
plied Murphy, "but 1 want you to under
stand that you will respect this writ. You
might as well come along quietly and
obey the Supreme Court's orders, no mat
ter who you gwt your orders from. If
you don't, Â» il place you under arrest."
Wilson hesitated for a moment and then
concluded to accompany Murphy to the
new City Hall. .Matters were explained
to him and at 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon he appeared before Justice Beau?
with his prisoner. He stated through a
deputy from the Attorney CJeneral's office
lhat he was not ready to proceed with the
hearing of the habeas corpus writ.
Attorney Collins consented lo any reas
onaHe continuance, providing that Rodley
In the meantime remain in the custody of
Sheriff Wilson.
Wilson promised to forego his intention
of at once taking Rodley to San Quentin,
and the casÂ« was continued until Monday.
"What am 1 going to do with my pris
oner now?" asked Sheriff Wilson after
leaving the Supreme Court.
"Keep him in your custody," answered
Collins, "and have him in court Monday."
"I suppose that I had better take him
fcark to OroviUe. then." said Wilson.
So it was that Rodlev Instead of hav
ing cupper last nifrht behind the peniten
tiary walls, as was projected. was on his
xray back to Butte County when it came

the little "bird" that always hears and
tells got hold of It, and so the story is out.
The betrothal of the happy couple is the
culmination of a long: and delightful ro
mance. Five years ago Mr. Goodall met
the lady of his choice, who was then Miss
Allie Hallenbeck. Soon after their meet
ing 1 Miss .Hallenbeck was married, but
she left her mark on the Goodall heart. A
little more than a month ago Goodall
again met the charmer of his youth. This
time 6he was free, and a rapid and ar
dent courtship gave the patient admirer
the right to place a solitaire on the third
finger of the lady's left hand.
Mrs. Hepburn, who undoubtedly has
made the best catch of the season. Is
a petite Titian beauty. A wealth of au
burn hair frames a delicate face well lit
up by a splendid pair, of dark eyes. She
is a stylish dresser and very attractive.
Harry W. Goodall is the son of the late
Captain Goodall. He has large commer
cial interests on this coast and i3 a mem
ber of the firms of Bennett & Goodall and
Piper-Aden-Goodall Company and the
Western* Commercial Company. He has.
an independent fortune that came to him
by inheritance, both from his mother and
his father. Upon the death of his father
$1,500,000 was equally divided between him,
his brother and two Bisters. r
The wedding of Mr. Goodall and Mrs.
Hepburn will be an extremely quiet af
fair, and only the Immediate relatives of
the young couple will be present.

new valentines, sentimental and comic
One of our show windows holds a large 'and tempting display of
valentines, but they are only a dipperful from the bucket in propor-
tion to the vast variety that adorn the tables in the stationery store.

they are. But you can't have much of an idea of the extent of the stock
or the good values it embraces unless you visit the store.

Our confections are made with the most particular â we misrht say
the most cranky â oversight. Our candy-man won't tolerate carelessness
any more than he would tolerate impurity in materials. He uses only
the purest sugar, the best of fruit flavors, the finest chocolate, hand-
shelled and washed almonds and other nuts â purity and care all the
, way through. â¢ :
