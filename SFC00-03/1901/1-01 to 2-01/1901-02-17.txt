the desperate young man drew nearer to
Â»ward Inevitable ruin. There were now
but two men at the table. One was a no

Alva Lugo, -and the other was Cage Horn.
Though they affected carelessness, the
two accomplished gamblers watched each

found himself with good cards he thoujrht
that the opportune moment had come for
him to retrieve his previous bad fortune
by a bold stroke. He bet at the Mexican

When she was about 16 she realized that

yond her reach. She could never earn
money enough to buy them by picking
cotton or sewing for the neighbors. Why
could she not be a female Jack Sheppard?
The thought no sooner entered her mind
than she acted upon it. Procuring a suit
of boy's clothing and a gun she slipped
out Into a lonely woods pasture by the
roadside and waited for the Fredericks

man who drove the coach, and she hal

Five- Year Mystery.
Five years passed before the mystery of
that ftape robbery was made plain to the
people of that community. Who wouid
ever have thought of such a piece of dar
ing and deviltry, on the part of a little
country girl?
After *ome weeks bad-, passed "Lane
Sinkler." as she was called In those early
days of her career, disappeared for a
Khort time. Her mother said that her
daughter had gone on a visit to an aunt la
Christl. When the little beauty
returned she was dressed, as her admirers
eaid. "to kill." Her rich relations, so re
port had it. had treated her nicely.
A banker's son w.as the iirst victim of
her seductive charms. Doubtless shÂ« at
first thought that she would be contented
with the comforts and luxuries that would
naturally come to her as the wife of this
rich young man; but the soon grew tired
of h'.rn and the parental restraint placed
on his Income. They went on a bridal trlD
to New Orleans, and she wanted to con
tinue It to Europe. When the prudent
young husband protested against making
Buch a long and costly journey sh*
feigned sickness in order to remain longer
in the Crescent City. The old banker In
Texas honored bis son's drafts until he
rot tired, and th*n oe.went over to New
Orleans to see what kept the bridal pair
Â£0 long.
Snared the Father.
His head was as white as snow. He was
a. deacon in a church and bad a wife
and several children, but he had not been
In New Orleans long before he was com
pletely in the power of the marvelouslv
beautiful young girl who had married his
eon. Infatuated bcvoid all control and
doubtless to some extent insane, he looted
h'.s own bank, and after making some ex
cuse to send his son home in great haste,
promising to follow by easy stages with
the sick girl, he fled to Europe.
Several weeks passed before the people
of Western Texas couid be made to com
prehend tha't Deacon Slocum had actually
eloped with his son's bride. The report
finally was confirmed by a reliable cattla
man, who had seen the crazy old banker
and the smiling siren together in a hotel
In Chicago, i The old women of the town
said "That Lane Sinkler is a witch." Men
who had barely escaped the witchery of
Â¦ her dreamy dark eye* were inclined to
think that she had mastered the art or
ecler.ee of hypnotism.
About six months passed before the dis
â¢ honored old banker returned to his home.
He came bareheaded, footsore and clothed
In rags. HisÂ» old wife was a good woman,
and she took him In and gave him food
and drink. He had walked a part of the
way over rough roads to get home, and
after a time it leaked out that he had
passed coal on a tramp of the ocean to
pay his passage across the Atlantic Forty
thousand dollars was no money to a girl
that wanted everything that glittered.
That was the amount the old man had
drawn from his own hank. They saw
London and Rome and Paris together.
Deserted "Papa" in Paris.
In gay Parl3 Elaine seems to have mads
acquaintances rapidly. One fine evening
che rede away from her hotel In a car
riage with a flash-looking: young man who
hardly noticed the old Texas banker. "Be
pood, papa." the said. "I may not come
hack to-night." She never did conte back.
The crazy old Texan searched for her for
many days, and when he found that the
police and the polite younp man about the
American Consulate were inclined to
laugh at him it suddenly dawned upon
him that he was far away from home and
mother, with very little money left in his
pocket*. Another man would have thrown
himself In the Seine, but the word suicide
â¢was not in the vocabulary for this Texan.
One would have thought that the girl
would have stayed away from her old
home, but she came back to Blanco
County, descending* upon her native vil
lare a sunburst of feminine charms,' made
more radiant, dazzling and irresistible by
wondrous auxiliaries of ribbons, silks and
rparkling diamonds. She built a fine
house for her mother, and like a dutiful
daughter she placed a handsome sum to
the old' lady's credit In a bank. What
bank, did you ask? Why, the same bank
she had plundered, and doubtless it was a
portion of the tame money that the in
fatuated old man had drawn from the
vault* or.ly a few months previously. A
lawyer could not have done this more
adroitly. There was no loophole in the
transaction." The money was' safe, and at
the command of the strange girl's mother.
Took Up "With a Spendthrift.
Texas was glad to see her go. and New
Orleans welcomed her once more- Her
next exploit is without a parallel in the
history of crime. A notorious : young

for several years divided his time between

he therefore formed a commission of Car
-
dlnals, to which he entrusted the adminis
tration of all the possessions of the Holy
See. At the head of this commission he
placed Cardinals Mocennl and Rampolla,
and, with their co-operation, he started
anew in the work of saving money and
investing the. surplus of the papal reve
nues in safe securities for the benefit of
his successors.
The daily expenses of the Holy Sea
amount, as shown by the statement above,
to about 53000. This includes the per
sonal expenses of the Pope, the sala
ries of the Cardinals residing in Curia,
the support of the nuncios and the lega
tions abroad, the running expenses of the
Vatican and the charities distributed
every year by the Popo in Rome and
throughout Italy. One million dollars a
year does not seem a very large expend
S. Interest accruing from previous in
vestments. This is a large item and is
principally the result of wise investments
during the reign of the present Pope, His
Immediate predecessor. Plus IX, accumu
lated during the last few years of his
reign a rum cf about $5,000,000 which he
had Invested in securities to provide for
a need that might arise In the reign of
eorne one or more of his successors.
The loss of the temporal power in 1S70.
with the consequent diminution of the
revenues of the Holy See, the uncertainty
of the amount of Peter's pence and the
enormous expenses of the Vatican Coun
cil,'during which he had to provide board
and traveling expenses for nearly every
Bishop In the world, led Plus IX to create
this contingent fund for tha possible fu
ture needs of his successors.
Unfortunately, however, the administra
tion of all these millions was then centered
In the hands of a certain per-
Eon, Monslgnor Folchi, who had
carte blanche *a regard* the se
lection of the securities and bonds
In which they 'were to be Invested. The
money was at first wisely Invested in gilt
edged securities, but several Italian poli
ticians and speculators talked Monslgnor
Folchi into selling them In order to place
the sum realized into fourth-rate Italian
enterprises. The result was that in less
than three months the whole J5.000.000 dis
appeared In the financial crash which
swallowed Crlspi and the Banco Romano.
This made Leo XIII realize tbe necessi

lees and special anniversaries. *
L Peter's pence, which consists of the
contributions sent by the faithful in all
parts of the world. This great source of
revenue was devised by the late Cardinal
Manning of London after the Pope lost
the revenues which came to him when he
enjoyed temporal pow.er. Now a special
collection is taken In every Catholic
church annually for this purpose, the
timounts being brought to Rome by each
Bishop at the time of hiÂ» visit ad llmina.
Millions are thus collected every year,
but. as has been said, the amount this
past year was greater than in any pre
vious year of Leo XIII's reign. â¢

It will be seen from the above state
ment that a handsome balance remains
In the papal treasury as a result of the
Income of the holy year. It will be seen
that the. Income of the Pope comes from
three different sources:
years and Is physically somewhat feeble;
HlÂ» apartments are on. the top floor of the
Vatican, Immediately over those occupied
by Cardinal Rampolla, which in turn are
directly over the rooms occupied by the
Pope. It is not easy for a man approach
lnr M years of age to climb up stairs, eo
when he took possession of his apart
ments In the Vatican Cardinal Mocennl
had an American elevator erected In the
court of EL Damaso and by Its means he
reaches his rooms with a minimum of ef
fort. It is the first elevator ever erected
la the Vatican, and Is used only by the"
Pope and the Cardinals. It Is to placed
that" carriages can drive direct to its en
trance.
Cardinal Mocennl is one of the most
popular Cardinals In the curia. He has
lived in Rome for many years and is In
great favor with the populace of the city.
The amount of money which he handles
for the Pope In ordinary years Is enor
mous, but in 1300, holy year, the Papal re
ceipts were Increased fully $1,500,000. and
the total tmount which passed through
Cardinal Mocennl's hands was not far
from $4,500,000. The greater part of this
enormous income is "Peter's pence." In
ordinary years this amounts to about
$1,000,000. but the greatly increased inter
est in the church In holy year was respon
f'.ble for a great Increase In the total
amount of offerings to this fund. Ap
proximately stated, the Pope's income last

lars' worth of Jewelry and other precious
articles were presented to him and shown,
to the public at an exhibition In the Vat
ican. All the magnificent church vest
ments, chalices, monstrances, pixes and
sacred vessels of silver and gold bava
feince found their way to poor churches
and convents, but the numerous articles of
Jewelry and loose gems have been dis
posed of by Monslgnor Marzolinl. tho
Pope's confidential secretary, at private
sale.
Leo XIII has certainly succeeded In sav
ing more money than Pius IX left at his
death, and It Is estimated that the close
cf the holy year the contingent fund of
the Holy See amounted to at least $30.
000,000. This Immense fortune Is care
fully protected against any claim that
might be advanced -by the family of the
Pope after his death. This is necessary,
for at the death of 'a pope It is customary
for his nearest blood relations to take pos
eesslon of all articles of value found in
his apartments. Another factor is the
Italian Government, which la said to-be
ready to lay hands upon whatever pontif
ical property it can, even as it did upon
the property of the religious orders.
In another way tbe present Pope's ex
penses are less than w?r? those of h!s
immediate predecessor. When Leo XTTt
was elected each of thÂ« Cardinals reeelve.l
a salary of $4500 annually from the Vat
ican. One of his first acts was to Issue
a decTfe providing: that only those Car
dinals who resided In C.ur!a and who did
not enjoy the revenues of a diocese wero
to draw this allowance from the Papal
treasury. Under the present admln'strn
tlon many other economical measures
have been Introduced. Ttie salaries of a
great number, of prelates .have been re
duced, the'number of 'Vatican employes
srreatly diminished, and the contributions
for schools'-'and Â¦ colleges In the pontifical
states a*nd in Rome reduced. For tht*
latter purpose Leo XIII has commanded
.tho more wealthy religious orders to fur
nish funds. â¢ It Is for this reason that
the Carthusian monks pay $200,000 a year
out of the Income which they derive from
the sale of th<Â» famous Chartreuse for
the support. of the French College of San
ta Clara In Rome, and the Benedictine:*
have been obliped to build and support
at their own expanse, the new university
of St. Anselmo in the same city.
Leo XIII has been somewhat of a dis
appointment to the Roman populace.
They look upon him as avaricious and pe
nurious, because ther were used to the
open handedness and generosity of Plu*
IX. when he still possessed the Papal
states, and tlie present Pontiff is very dif
ferent. Very little of Leo Xin> Income
Is ever expended by him upon his own
personâ In fact, his present hobby is econ
omy, and only a short time aÂ«rrÂ» he grreatly
astonished his chief gardener by ordering
that all the produce ?nd fruit raised !r:
the Immense grounds snrround!nÂ«r thÂ»Â»
pontifical ralace should be sold in fho
public market of Rome, so as to obtain
the money, necessary for their improve
ment. â¢
It Is stated on the highest "authority
'that since 15S3 Leo XIII has been abte to
invest some years as high an J3.000.000 and
that the annual amount bo placed run*
much less than $1,000,000. Most of tho
money rests In British bonds and securi
ties and the income from them already
reaches a very high figure.- Owing to tha
fluctuations of . the financial market.
American Industrial securities, although
they pay large dividends, are avoided by
thoÂ»e who have thÂ© placing of the Pope's

Oblique eyes, like tho.se <i the Chinese
and Japanese, are Â¦ ke*>!> Hcrl, tactful,
quick, artful and alert.
The drooping of the upper lid Is a sign
of strong desire" to accumulate property
of all sorts. Persons with this eye will not
only work hard to acquire money, but
also knowledge, position, power and
friends. They are often talented and are
usually fond of games of chance. ,
The eyebrows also are full of meaning.
A clear, thick, overshadowing eyebrow,
free from bushiness, Is 'always the certain
sign of., good,, sound, manly, mature-un
derstanding, though the owner of it is sel
dom very original or bold, aspiring or ad
venturous in disposition. Horizontal eye
brows, rich and clearly defined, always
denote understanding," combined with
coldness of heart and great capacity, for
framing plans. Wild eyebrows , are; never
found over the __ eyes of a mild person,
while . eyebrows waving above the >. eyes,
short and thick, signify /capacious mem
ory, flexible; Ingenuous and mild good na
ture. Arched : eyebrows , show the person
to be proud, bold, high-spirited and vain
glorious. Eyebrows with short, light hair
generally denote a timid, credulous dispo
sition, and such a person is apt to under
take more ' than he can perform. Black
and thinly covered eyebrows signify that
the individual will do^ nothing without
much consideration.
To Tead , character in the â¢ hair, texture
as well as ; color; must be observed. The
finer the hair the gentler the birth or the
higher grade of : family stock. People
with the hair as flne v as silk are of very
refined tastes, of artistic temperament,
but inclined to be moody and changeable,
They ' are apt to be happy one day and
depressed the next, but cheerful spirits
predominate. .. They are easily influenced
by those they like. / They, usually reach
success In" art, music or ' literatureâ Emer-J
son and Longfellow, for instanceâ and are
fine ; managers, because they- generally
possess 'energy and adaptability.' A'per
son of common ..extraction seldom has
very fine hair. The locks of such a per
son may be a crown of glory In | quantity
and color, j but 'â¢ never . in \ quality. \ Curly
halr.means that the n owner has inherent
grace, and poetic ease of the body. The
closer, the ends of the hair cllrig together
the more intellectuality; does the owner
possess. * Jonathan Edwards and ' Audubon
had such ha'?.
People with fine black hair are nigh
strung, while those with coarse black
hair, if they are smart, are nearly always
mean. Men or women with dark hair
are more tempestuous than those with
light hair. The dark eyes and com
plexions that go with the different shades
of dark brown and black hair denote
strong feelings. Black hair that is
coarse and lusterless. in nine cases out
ten hides a' treacherous and jealous na-
The lighter the hair the more sensitive
and touchy the owner, except In rare
cases, where the person ' enjoys perfect
health. Brown hair indicates common
sense; good i: judgment and . reason. Men
with fine, light hair are, as a rule, smart
and assertive. Men with fine brown hair
are quick, thoughtful and less apt to be
selfish than their very light or very dark
haired - brothers. .Women with pale
blonde ; hair, of -the colorless, ashy* kind,
are impulsive and. changeable;; those with
dark brown hair thereverse. -
People with very light hair and fine red
hair generally succeed; in anything they

When the eye is straight, finely arched,
clear, transparent and modest, there will
be found a frank, hopeful disposition, one
easily approached, sensitive and respon

A person with a bright eye has naturally
a large power of possible development.
The bright-eyed one may be stupid, but it
Is because of lack of development and not
of any dearth . of natural powers. The
hopeless eye Is the large, placid, oxlike
orb,.
Gray eyes with a greenish tint are indi
cative of much intellectuality. They ara
especially Indicative of Impulsive, Impres
sionable temperamentsâ a mixture of the
sanguine and bilious â which produce- -the
poetic and artistic natures. The gray eye
Is an almost universal characteristic of
men and women of great' Intellect. Shake
speare had deep gray eyes, which were re
markable for their near approach to blue.
Up to the death of the poet the original
color remained. Lord. Byron had the gray
eye of the poet. Coleridge also had gray
eyes, but, like Shakespeare and Byron,
the gray was at times, and under mental
excitement particularly, tinted with an
other color.
CHARACTER IN EYES AND HAIR
The pleasant, light blue eye . with the
honest glance, must not be confounded
with another sort of eye of a pale blue,
almost steel-colored hue, which has a con
tinually shifting sort of motion both of
the eyelids and the pupils. Such eyes are
indicative of a doubtful and selfish nature.
Very dark blue eyes with something of
the tint of the violet show great power of
affection and purity of mind, but it is re
marked of these that the possessor of
such eyes is seldom a person of much
intellectuality. It Is the universal opinion
that blue eyes are more significant of
tenderness, and of Â«. certain yielding of
purpose, than either the brown, black or
gray eyes.
The clear, light blue eyes of Americans,
with 1 a calm steadfastness in their glance,
are Indicative of a cheerful disposition, of
a serene temper and of a constant nature.
In Judging character by the eyes the
color, the brightness or dullness, and the
rhape must be considered. The colors
â¢ most common to the eyes â brown, gray,
blue, hazel and black, or what is called
blackâ are seldom found In all the purity
of the Individual color. Regarding the
black eye. like the Spaniard's, it la dis
taoce only that makes .it appear to bo
purely mack, ror the rea'son that the deep
yellow brown color in in such strong con
trast to the white of the eye that the pupil
always appears black. There are also
eyes of bo bright a hazel as to seem al
most yellow, and there are eyes that bear
but the often-reiterated remark concern-
Ing "green-eyed Jealousy." for they are,
to all appearances, positively green. They
are sometimes beautiful when shaded with
long dark eyelashes, but they are not
indicative of a good disposition, and be
long particularly to a person of Jealous
temperament.
Intensity of feeling is to be found In
the man or woman who possesses black
eyes. Aaron Burr had -such eyes. The
brown eye, when not of the yellowish
tint, but pure russet brown, shows an af
fectionate disposition, .and the darker the
brown â that is, the more they verge on to
that deepest of brown color In eyes we
are In the habit of calling blackâ the
more ardent, while It is agreed that the
affection of persons with black eyes Is
most lasting of all.

Those who intend to put this simple cold
cure in practice, and it is a remedy for
many another evil, should remember that
water ufken with meals does not count at
all. or if It does it is rather to be added
to the side of the enemy. It must be'
taken before breakfast and again just be
fore retiring, and a whole quart must be
sipped within say three-quarters of an
hour. If cold water chills one, the tem
perature may be raised a little until this
difficulty Is overcome. Some good cheap
distilled water Is best where there Is any
question of the purity of the water sup
ply.
Of course, any system of living which
builds up a well-nourished body is Inimi
cal to colds as well as other forms of dis
ease. Cold water taken In this manner
simply washes the stomach, carrying off
the Injurious acids which generate there
and which, allowed to circulate through
the blood, impoverish It. thereby weaken
ing the vitality of the person. After wash-
Ing the blood clean as It were, the next
thing is to Induce circulation. This Is
done by means of the vigorous currying,
which besides bringing tne blood to the
surface to resist external chill, also opens
the pores, allowing Impurities to escape.
Then the dally bath finishes the work.
This she dtd and the cold failed to ma

The cold water was easily managed and
soon became Indispensable, but at. first
the horse brush seemed to tear the sensi

her physician, however, the patient per
sisted, at first barely touching the bris
tles to her body. Within a few weeks
slie was not'only able to do the currying
most vigorously, but really anticipated It
with pleasure. The signs of the first win
ter cold drove her In haste to the doctor.
The great man of medicine refused to sup
ply her with drugs. He questioned her
as one would a child as to leaving her
windows open at night, as to drinking
water, regularly and taking her exercises,
upon ; a.11 of .which she passed a fair ex
amination. He said: "Then, you have
been' Indulging in holiday overeating.
Whenever - you eat a heavy rich dinner,
and let it be as seldom as possible, omit
claims to have attained immunity
by the use of pure cold water as a medi
cine and an ordinary horse brush for cur
rying as a morning and evening exercise.
Owing to a severe nervous breakdown she
was obliged to consult a New York physi
cian famous for his original and simple
methods of treatment. After laying down
the law on the subject of diet and fresh
air, he said: "You will also, go to some
big department store and purchase for 33
cents a horse brush, with which you will
give your whole body a thorough rubbing
each morning before you bathe. As soon
as. you rise you will fill a quart. pitcher
with drinkinc" water and sip It slowly
while dressing. At night do the same
thing over again, omitting, of course, the
bath."

But it is the introduction of a novel dis

however, be both graceful and attractive
in order to meet with their approval.
The new garlands and trailing vines are
a pleasing combination of these two

when Mr. Kelly was State â¢ Forester of
California she frequently accompanied
him on hdrsÂ«back journeys through the
high Sierras, traveling with no outfit
other than such as "could be tied behind

relying upo/i the compass for guidance,
and camping without shelter wherever
night overtook them and grass and water
were found.

The Century ,'p to have a serial story by
Irving Bacheller, the author of that popu

tale of 1S12. Two types of the men who
have helped . to make America are set
forth in Itâ one, a Northern Yankee,
quaint, rugged and wise; the other a man
who has the hardy traits of a. Puritan
with the romantic temperament of a cava
lier. The scene of the Ptory Is In the
neighborhood of Lake Champlaln, and the
title Is "D'ri and I." It will begin in the

Such a book is one which has Just made
it* appearance from the pen of Mrs, D.
IJlr.jri ur.'lT the title of "Two Heroes and
a Violinâ An Extravaganza." The name
rounds veilâ and after all there is a great

disouf-R the remarkable personality of the
hrrn. Tbere are really two heroes, as the
title Fuggfsts, but the one â although
truly heroic in tho literal significance of
the wordâ is by no means the center
point "f interest as compared with the
otherâ the evil, Felfish. fascinating
genius that liguros throughout the tale.
In briff Mr?. Biaei's extravaganza is a
vivid p''n picture of the intimata and pri
vate Ilff- of a great violinistâ the greatest
of his time, half genius and half maniac.
Hrr book Is divided into three partsâ
an clrmcr.t of weakness in itself. The
first few chapters are supposed to have
been written by the mother by adoption
of the violinist, a Contessa di Rimini.
The second part \?, an autobiographic ac
count of the impressions and life of the
virtuoso. The third part is a sequel from
the pen of Sard, the second hero and
manager of the violin genius. This last
part throws a doubt over the authorship
of the first p^rt by hinting that it was
merely the fiction of the diseased brain
of the violinist himself.
The r-trrngth of tlie book lies In part
two. It glvts one of the best pictures in
literature of the genius known as the
violin virtuoso. Gaclano Lucchesl is a
man far beyond his type of the present
day. He is a second Papaninl. who play*
because he is iraoelltd so to do by a
shadowy genius why tells him that In
Gaetano he will lire again and rule the
world with his music. He does nothing
except by inspiration and allows his emo
tior-F to bo rule aim that at times he
wanders half-crazed and unconscious
through the fVlds and forests, -then re
turns to his room to play the weird- com
positions which have floated through his
brain.
Gaetano as a man is thoroughly un
principled, selrt.sh. and irresponsible. His
friend Â£arci. a noble specimen, though a
cynic, directs and holds him In check
FUfficiontly to- make him the god of the
music-loving public: Inn for his moral sal
vation he la obliged to work his own way.
Naturally the handsome and gifted mu-
Fician is most attractive to the fair sex,
and all of his many interesting affairs of
the heart are marked by his extreme
beartlesroess. He iÂ« an Italian, inherit
ing in fuil the mercurial and passionate
nature of the race. He tells his story
with a!! the extravagance of expression
characteristic of thu southern clime. His
own account* of hi* first appearance In
Italy, then in Fraiice and then in Eng
land, with the varying effects of his music
on ihc three different races, are dramat
ically vivid and show the author at her
best. Here Is his derorlption of his debut
It shows so well the nervous excitement
of the genius, and, after his acceptance
by the audience as a musical marvel, the
inordinate vanity of the. manâ for it must
be remembered that this Is from the view
point of the crazy artist himselfâ that it
stands as one of the best bits of its kind:
We traveled, to Milan. ' where my first con
cert took place at the Theater La Scula, upon
the lith of Sentfrniber. isâ . As the eventful
evening apuroarhed I was consumed with an
Intense nervous excitement, â¢svfclch Increased

debut. I became wild with aueulsh over the

tain n;y cxacs*rated fancies I drank huge

but my excitement increased. Sard chlded mÂ«
upon my weakness, childishness, and, upon
reaching the theater, escorted me to a huge,
dimly lighted space with a curtain stretched
acroM one side. Upon a table in the center
of this space rested the . violin.
"Now cotne." he Â»ald, leading me toward
the curtain, "take a peep at the house."
Pointing to' an opening in the cloth he bade
me look. I did so, r&Â«PÂ«l. peeped again, then
staggered away. : . *
"I cannot!" I cried, shaking my head apa
waving my arms frantically- "I cannot pÂ« J

I stall fall. I know I shall. They will hiss.
Ah. me. I would rather die!"
Fright had worked me to a state of frenry.
Ealuccl came rushing toward us. surmising
correctly that there was something wrong. ai>
I continued to frantically slash the air with
my long arms. Sard gazed at me In dismsy.
"My dear Gaetano." he said, endeavoring
to soothe. "I believe everybody finds the first
time rather trying but had I your talent I
would 'hot feel the leant uneasiness. Tou
dare not refuse to go on. Such an action would
be your ruination. Play you must. These
people will nr.t countenance being brought
here for nothing. Shake oft this womanish
weakness: be a man. Such action* in you are
absurd. When the curtain rises and you find
yourself before this vast multitude, as you
call it. think not of your auditors; concentrate
your mind upon the music. Imagine yourself
alone in some vast wilderness; the faces con
sider as so much shrubbery: the strange,
curious eyes as so many stars."
The musicians in the orchestra began tuning
their Instruments and Sard dragged me from
the stage. Salurci dashed away and returned
holding something in a glass, which he forced
me. to Vrlnk. It was liquor of some sort, anl.
reduced me to a harmless lunatic. I began
rhÂ»dding Imbecile tears, and between my sobs
Â»Â«walled my fate ar.d begged to be let off.

despairingly. "Go; they are waiting."
I began wringing my hands and implored
then: to permit me to gaze once more upon
the audience.
"I must see them again." V gasped. "I
may then have the courage to go on."
I crept along, keeping close to the scene,
till I reached a point that commanded a fa.r
view of the bouse. Then something occurred
I have ne\-er discovered what, nor have I tried.
A terrific blow landed between my shoul
der Made*, and the nÂ»xt Instant I was upon
the stage In the full glare of the lights, and
the house was welcoming me with thunder

overtaken me. I could not raise the instru

Â¦tiffWi * mast unhappy mortal. Then, sud

huge* clouds rolled before my terrified eyes,
whose mists dampened my fevered brow and
cooled the heated brain within. A hand gently

the companion of my childhood, stood before
me. The electric power contained within this
creature, the magic of hifc touch, caused the
stagnant blood to rush like' quicksilver through
my vein*. Cowardice vanished; I seemed to
swell with confidence and self-importance. I
realized' this wan the event of my life, ' and
like a soldier stood strong and mighty to meet
the crisis.
-The clouds rolled away; the lights, the hot

thought it would burst. I staggered from the
stage, tp be received behind the scenes with
exultant cries and embraces from Sard and
Saluccl. Tea, I had made a success; the ap

He opens his story with the usual and
necessary preamble of the causes which
led up to the war and the exact relations
between the Boers and "Uitlanders which
caused the trouble. All of which Is quite
necessary to make any history complete,
but at this time bo well known to the
'average reader as to receive merely a
glance. In his descriptions of the various
engagements Dr. Doyle is at his best, for
here the pen of the novelist can have full
Bway. His pictures are virile and force
ful, and convey a better idea of a modern
battle, with its improved weapons of war,
than those of any of the more matter of
fact historians who have endeavored to
depict these scenes. Moreover, Dr. Doyle
Is himself a warrior, and having been on
Dr. Doyle realizes fully the narrow es
cape his country has had from a great
fall, and there is no effort on his part to
minimize In the least the almost fatal
mistakes which are in evidence on the
part "of the British military authorities.
He also gives the Boers full credit for
their remarkable campaign, which far sur
passed anything that the civilized world
believed they were capable of putting into
execution. On the first page he says:
"They are one of the most rugged, virile
and unconquerable races ever seen upon
the face of the earth," and furthermore
states that "Napoleon and. all his veterans
never treated us so roughly as these hard
bitten farmers, with their ancient the
ology and their inconveniently modern
rifles." : .
. Although' \the struggle between Great
Britain and the Boers is by no means at
ah end, still the "histories" of the war are
already -among the number legion. Of
course, the great battles of the war are
over, but still the tight is on. Up to date
one of the most interesting histories that
has been presented for our notice Is that
by A. Conan Doyle of "Sherlock Holmes"
fame. Dr. Doyle }3 too well known as a
novelist to waste paper in singing his
praises as a writer of fiction. He now ap
pears as a historian, and from a careful
perusal of his pages on "The Great Boer
War". we musfconcede that he is entitled
to laurels in. this line also. From the data
at hand, when his book went to press he
has given a most creditable showing. He
has conformed to fact throughout, and
yet ' his work is enlivened with the dra
matic style of the novelist, which Im
presses with double force its points on tho
mind of the reader. He writes with great
fairness, and no one can possibly take
exception to the work because its author
Is an Englishman to the core. Dr. Doyle
served under the British ilag and was
consequently In a position to know where
of he speaks. This, combined with his
literary ability, makes his book one of the
most valuable on the subject of all those
which have as yet appeared. He has a
way of impressing his pictures on the
mind of the reader that is not soon to be
forgotten.

French wars in 1765, the time of the stamp

on which . our national civil system is

lawyer and records his facts with legal
clearness, brevity and Judicial impartial

the period 1S61-95.
The first volume the author divides into
two books. The first book discusses the
new nation and the second the formation

that our national system was evolved
from colonial conditions and was in no

He narrates the history of the country
from the time of the stamp act to tho
completion of- the constitution by the

Volume two shows that while the sys
tem proposed by the Federal convention
was approved by the people, still there
was a demand for "its amendment and
that in 1804 this demand was complied
with and the first twelve amendments
were ratified. After this there was a long
period of compromises and contests which
arose under the attempt to carry out the
system. The volume concludes wi^i the
account of the last effort at compromise,
the proposed amendment of 1S61.

and educational facilities.

of Cuba: its resources, area and popula

considerable space to the military occu

OF BOOKSTHE Kahunas are casting strange

witch doctor is called. Eut the new con

Several prominent natives have recently
met with mysterious and sudden deaths.
They were ail men who openly favored
annexation. They were ell warned by the
witch dociors ihat they were doomed.
Only the other day Daniel Nr'.one. a na

"Prayed to death" by the kahunas, say

"Poisoned by Â«he kahunas," say the for

"Pooh!" say the "national native" party.
The "national" natives are those who
chafe under tt-.e new regime. They have
resorted to the kahunas as a last resort to
bring about a change. " Naturally they are
not anxious for an investigation of
Naone's death, and claim that he died
naturally.
But the island authorities are deter

and peculiar deaths. The "carpetbag

of which has at last aroused the dyed-in
the-wool conservative native, and in the
emergency he has evoked the aid of the
mysterious kahuna.
How well the kahunas have done their
work the recent death roll and the thor
pughjy intimidated natives attest. . .
The kahur.a <s a witch doctor, a juggler
cf potions, a eir.ser of incantations, a.
graybeard who mixes shivery spells, afel
low who gathers lethel herbs from graves
In the crescent of the moon, an owlish
Individual who hoo<3oos cattle and re
moves malignant influences for 15 cents.
He wouldn't rank very high In this coun
try, and it is doubtful if a hustling kahu
r.a couM make a living here even by ad
vertising. Eut in Hawaii, among the su
perstitious natives, whatever he says
"goes." The unquestioning natives Â¦ be
lieve that a kahuna through his mystic
epells can put a hoodoo on a man that
will rigorously last through seven gen
erations; eo when a kahuna tells a native
voter to vote for a certain man or with
a certain party that native voter firmly
believes he will be forever damned unless
be obeys implicitly. And that's the new
klr.d of power the enterprising kahuna is
wielding In his native land under the up
to-date kind of American politics as
played there. Is It any wonder, then, that
a roar of protest went up from the "car
retbargers" when It was noised about
that the "national natives" had called out
these kahuna reserves to meet the tricks
and ballot devices of their resourceful op
ponents.
On top of all the charges and counter
charges came the sensation over Naone's
death. Naone vras a prominent native;. he
belonged to what is called the "advanced
party." aT.d was developing suspicious
tendencies to affiliate with what the con
servative natives termed in their new po
litical linpo "rank outsiders." Those same
rank outsiders had shrewdly conceived
thut to capture a necessary part of the
Hawaiian native vote it would.be good
politics to pather a number of the most
rromireiu Hawaiian* into their fold and
pive them a certain amount o-f patronage.
They figrred that the lamblike native
voters would follow these native leaders.
Naone, it i? said, was only one ,of this
number. The native party saw this de-'
fectlon wtth resentment and apprehension.
Those who watched the contest dec'are
that the call to the kahunas was the move
mr.de by the conservatives to blcck it.
The kahunas arc among the most stanch
and loyal lovers of their native land. If
there is any Kanaka who foots the isl-/
and sul! who believes fervently and Im
plicitly In its old-time institutions and
l'fc. or any native who would d!e defend
ing Hawaii for the Hawailans, It is the
Vnhuni. This ; sn't strange when It is un
d.rstood that their very profession and
living is bound up in the superstitious awe
of the natives, for the Hawaii of Kame
harroha. And so it is that any native
leader or native party that is working or
plotting to preserve "old Hawaii" can al
ways rely on the kahunas for stanch and
ready support. "".:'-
Naone's death is a rare one to furn'sh
eliminations and recriminations between
two parties at loggerheads over such a
state of things. As far as Is known, noth
ing particular In the way of illness was
the matter with him up to the time he
was accosted on the street by a kahuna.
That was about the middle of last Decem
ber.
"Oh. ho, stubborn Naone," said th*
witch doctor, as a parting shot to th>.Â»
man who refused to desert the advanced
party. "I see a red devil sitting on your
right shoulder; he is grinning and point
ing to the moon, which means that inside
of a month you will die. Forswear tlvs
new party and stand by old Hawaii, or be
ware."
Naone had embraced Christianity and
was a man of great personal courage, but
in spite of his years and his knowledge
in his new faith, in spite of his confidence
In his new political all-es, he shivered at
the old soothsayer's warning. Pagans, so
scientists say, though other religions may
wean them from the worship of their fore
fathers, always return to the home gods
of their ancestors when in dire extremi
ties. Beneath Naone's dark skin, in spite
of modern culture and a . new religion,
flowed' his Kanaka blood and he was as
keenly alive to the sayings of a grisly
old Kahuna as was his grandfather, who
recklessly paddled naked through the
beach combers.
The evidence in the case as gathered by
the "carpet baggers" shows that he must
have been very seriously affected by thÂ»
"witch doctor's" words, for although he
was in excellent health when he heard
them, within a week he took to his bed,
complaining that he did not feel well:
that some way or other he had an Impres
sion that his right side was becoming
paralyzed. This was the side indicated by
the kahuna on which he claimed to seo
the red devil sitting-.
Naone's friends gave him some sound
practical advtce and called in a hardhead
ed old physician who wasn't afraid of tha
spells and incantations of an island full p!
kahunas. The doctor tackled his Job with
zest, for he felt it was a test case of the
modern medical profession against* th<2
oldtime _ witchcraft of the kahuna. In
three days he had Naone up and aroun'l
and in such a cheerful frame of mind that
he* laughed at the idea of such a stront,
robust man as himself ever becoming par
alyzed. Â¦ . Â¦
Naone was leaving his house for his
office next morning when on the threshold
he almost bumped into the imperturbable
kahuna, who was evidently lying In wait
for him. "Ah, stubborn Naone." said the
old sorcerer.' shaking his withered hands
at him. "Still my old eyes see the, red dev-il
sKtirig there on your shoulder; he has ta
ken another grip and he shouts: 'Naone's
days are shortening/ Within two weeks
he will be mine!' Return, oh, foolish man,
return to the party of your fathers, ero
it is too late." . |
At these words the ill-fated' man stag
gered as though struck a heavy blow. H<Â»
grasped the balustrade and steadied him
self. Then with a low groan he turned
and re-entered the house. The kahuna
followed him unchecked. What took
place within the privacy of Naone's room
no man knows, but when the kahuna left
the stricken man had possession of some
new medicine In a small vial. v This vial
was discovered under his pillow when
about half of it was taken. The trained
nurse Insistently Irore It over to the doc-
tor despite the tears and assertions of Na
one that it was the only medicine th*t
would save him. â¢
From the moment he was deprived of
the contents of the kahuna's vial Naon*
seemed to give up all hope and sank rap
idly. He bore no- evidences of any acutf
sickness; his life. seemed simply to flicker
out and he died within three weeks of tho
first warning 1 . .
The political results of Naone's death
are whaj might have been expected. ThÂ»
natives watched the case with . we. for
Naone's course In politics and his defiance
of the order of the kahuna was known
to all his countrymen. Almost before the
last breath left his distraught body tho
report was buzzed about the, native quar
ters that "the red devil has got Naone,
as the kahuna warned." And now the 3U
perstitions among the Kanaka voters are
firmly convinced that Naone's death is a
sign from the ancient gods that the only
way to escaDe the clutch' of the red devil
is to vote as the kahuna tells you.
Charges of foul play are being bandied
thick and fast over Naone's sudden de
mise. The natives possess recipes for
making vegetable poisons which -were in
days gone by administered by certain ka
hunas or their creatures to those thev
wanted out of the wiv. In the forthcom
ing Investigation of his death by the au
thorities some of his friends will try to
prove that if the kanuna did not directly
use some form of poison in the medicine
given him' he, "prayed him to death," 'a
threat much resorted to by witch doctors
when trying to influence superstitious na
tives. :
Those who are versed ' in native wayj
and beliefs declare that It doesn't make
any difference what kind of findings the
Inquest returns. According to them, the
superstitious among the natives are al
ready fully convinced that Naone wm
given to the red devil for not doinsr as
the kahuna told him. and that "settles
the votes and everything else naagtns; on
the matter. * I'v/^**^
It is the power ef the kahuna "pitted
against modern skepticism. At present
the kahuna Is certainly holding his own.
SZTflortfazal Orgies arid
VOODOO CEREMONIAL
worship, of the s^at
Â¦'yeHovf Serpent
PROFESSOB ROBERT T. HILL, the
faxnoos Government explorer, has
Just returned to Washington with
a grewsome story from Hayti,
where he had the remarkable privilege of
witnessing a voodoo ceremonialâ one of
those demoniacal orgies which on that Isl
and celebrate the worship of the Great
Yellow Serpent. This serpent, represented
at the festivals of the devil's cult by a
cannless native epedes of er.ake. is sup
posed to be an incarnation of the arch
fiend himself, possessing all knowledge,
but approachable only through bis priests
*nd priestesses â the watchers at the
shrine of Obeah, who Is otherwise known
as Jo-Ju. Mumbo-inmbo or Vuudoux, t- e
last of these names being commonly cor
rupted Into Voodoo.
"Cannibalism !s a conspicuous feature
ef these rites," said Professor HUL "It Is
tnr-esticr.a.bly a fact that large numbers
of young children are offered up annually
In Hayti as sacrifices to- the Great Yellow
Snake. Indeed, it is known that mothers
frequently dedicate their Infants at birth
to this purpose, the fatal ceremony being
postponed ordinarily until the victim has
reached the age of 2 years. Invariably the
ritual winds up with a feast, the details
of which are too horrible to be described.
Only when human prey Is not obtainable
Is a black goat, which must have a white
rpot on It, or a white cock used as a sub
stitute. The cock chosen for this^purpose
Is always one of those freak chickens
which nave their feathers growing the
wrong way.
"This cult of Vaudoux Is extremely an
dent. representing the most primitive
form of religion. It is serpent worship,
with all the Incidentals of witchcraft. Just
as it prevails in the darkest parts of Af
rica. The sodality of sorcerers, the smell-
ers out of witches, are a widespread
priesthood, whose organization and forms
of ceremonials date i-ack to a remote an
tiquity. One finds their order represented
in oÂ»r own "country by so-called voodoo
doctors, who deal in charms and 'hoodoo'
spells and have an extensive practice
among the colored people. The .'buck and
wing' dancing of our nigger minstrel and
vaudeville stage comes directly- from the
ceremonial dancing of Vaudoux, and its
'pigeon wings' and other peculiar capers
have special significance in connection
with the rites of Obeah.
"The religion of Vaudoux seÂ«ms to be
preserved en the island of . Hayti with
more of its pristine purity than anywhere
else in the- world, not even excepting' Af a
rlca. The republic cf Hayti, in fact,' is
nothing more nor less than- a piece of the
dark continent set down near our shores.
Its population, numbering, about 1,000,000
souls, is composed , of remnants of hun
dreds of savage tribes brought ; thither
during the slave dealing days to work on
the plantations. They were savages when
they arrived and they are savages still,
retaining their ancient customs and insti
tutions.
"The cult of Obeah Is a secret society.
Into which members - are initiated wita
complicated rites. Its ceremonials con-,
slst largely of dances, which are accom
panied by drums, and each particular
solemnity or ritual Is accompanied by, Its
own 'tune/if such a term may be used.
Everywhere 'through the mountains of
Hayti the traveler hears the drums con
stantly sounding, and to the Â¦ ear of a
stranger the noise would be nothing moro
than tomtomming, but to a member of tÂ»-a
organization each kind of beating has its
own" peculiar meaning. Thus, on a cere
monial ' occasion, when ] the drummers
strike the 'theme' the. participants. know
the | dance and song Which go with It.
There are- from 300 to 400 - different dances.
"The ceremonials are rituals of witch
craft and are held for the purpose of i
gaining ; various favors from the Great*
Yellow Serpent, such as the cure of sick
ness, the bringing down of evil upon ene
mies and even the causing of death to
persons .who may have given "offense to
the society or to individual members. As
the fiances progress they become more
and more furious, usually ending in, a
frenzy that overcomes all the partici
pants, who become crazy for the time be
ing, many of them, falling into a sort of
cataleptic condition. The culmination of
the wgy is the sacrifice of. a living ani
mal and the drinking of its blood, which
is passed^ around j for that purpose in . a
Jug; mixed ' with rum. . Finally, the vic
tim is boiled in a pot and eaten. * *
"The "drums used to accompany . the
dances are < an important feature of the
ceremonials. Usually they are employed
in groups; of three, each group having
its peculiar color and significance. The
red ' drums, for example; come into play
only on those more serious occasions
when the .: ritual i happens to have for its
special object the bringing down of wrath
upon a person who may have been so
unfortunate as to j excite the ill-will of
the society. This set of drums is known
as the trio of death,- red being, the color,
appropriate to death and the sacred color
of ' the Vaudoux.' When beaten they are
supposed to excite the vehement anger of
the evil spirit which is to be directed
against the Individual aimed at. .- . .
"Each voodoo ceremony is presided
over by a sorcerer-in-chief, known as the
Papeloi, who Is assisted by a witch
woman . called the Mameloi. - These per
sonages have attained their high rank In
the society, as it is understood; through
the long practice of extraordinary wick
. â¢ . - - -Â¦ - -
edness, and usually they are of hldedus
aspect, the notion being that their super
natural power varies directly with their
ugliness. Nobody dares to disobey them,
inasmuch as to do so would be to invite
the most dreadful consequences, and they
are able to devote their entire time to
evil-doing being maintained by gifts
which their, followers bestow upon them
in the nominal shape of offerings to the
devil god. Â¦ 1
"These priests and priestesses are usu
ally distinguished by a peculiar knotting
of their kinky wool.'. but, -In. Hayti - any
old man or woman of strange appearance
is apt to be suspected of being a Papelot
or.Mamelol. They undoubtedly possess
a remarkable knowledge of the medicinal
properties of plants, * especially as to poi
sons and ! febrifuges. So great Is the
faith In them as . medical practitioners
that in cases of serious illness they are
commonly called in even by persons out
side the pale of the voodoo organization,
and to-day no regular physician, no mat
ter-how capable, can make a living In
Hayti, notwithstanding the number of
dreadful diseases ! which prevail on the
island. - Â¦ , .. â¢ : *' - -
""The Â¦witch doctors of Vaudoux are
known to be poisoners, and in this capac
ity they may well be dreaded by persons

with certain extracts and decoctions of
plants which, being administered in small

poisons which work in so subtle a fash
ion that no harm Is done by them ap

No ' wonder, then, that voodoolsm ex

afraid to offend the organization. Rather
than do so, they will pay largely to have

and history records that only a few years

In its most fearful rites, bathing himself {
In blood and otherwise declaring: himself* L
a believer In Obeah.
"The nominal religion of the people ot
Hay tl Is Roman Catholic, but there are
few priests of that faith permanently resi
dent in their parishes, and during their . I
absence the churches are commonly dese
crated by the performance of voodoo rites.
A curious mingling of Christianity and Â¦
paganism In its worst form has come
about, the temples of Obeah being fre
quently adorned with pictures of the Vir
gin Mary and the saints. It Is even said
that - human sacrifices have been offered*
up on the altars of the church"- the red
drums of death being beaten In the sane- 9
rtuary. It Is â¢worth mentioning, by the
way. that the kldnapins of children for .
sacrifices Is not Infrequent In Hayti. and -
not long ago a lady missionary testified
that to her certain knowledge human flesh
was often sold In the markets of the In
terior towns. This last might seem in
credible were It not realized how well- ?
nigh universal Is cannibalism In the dark
continent, and that most cf the peonle of
Hayti are almost unmodified savages. -
"One gets a notion of the antiquity of
voodoolam from the testimony of ' Pliny, i '-
the historian; who, writing In the century"
before Christ, mentions the fact as well ;
known in his time that African slaves in
Rome and elsewhere in Italy had a re- -
llglon of their -own. which, when permit-
ted. they practiced at night with horrid
Incantations, the presence of the serpent
being considered necessary, and that there >
was a priestess who went Into a species

UNDER THE SPELL OF THE KABUNA
THE SUNDAY CALL.Follow as a rxde a mixed diet;
without allowing too great a dis
proportion in quantity between the
various classes of food. A mixed
diet slwuld have two bases, namely,
the class of the articles of food and
the amount of nutriment they con
tain; that is to say, not only the
species have to be mixed, but also
the concentrated zvith the more di
lute foods. For instance, a proper
ly mixed diet for a healthy individ
ual should contain animal food,
Bcar in mind that high liznng as
sociated zvith want of exercise is
the natural generator of gall stones,
stones in the bladder or kidneys,
gout, obesity and many cases of
Bright's disease. The late Czar
'Alexander HI wait to an untimely
death through this cause, notwith
standing his robustness.
Remember that any amount of.
food taken in excess of the body's
legitimate demand becomes a for
eign and injurious substance in
our organism, capable of produc
ing disorder or disease. Among
the latter zve find headache, bilious
ness, gall stones, jaundice, various
forms of skin disease â eczema,
hives, boils â dyspepsia, congestion
of the liver and brain, kidney
trouble, gout, obesity and rheuma
tism. The evil effects may be man
ifested either immediately, gradu
ally or later in life. Overeating,
especially if habitual, is a sin,
zchich penalty is always sure to fol-
cordingly, meals at regu
lar hours will find this organ pre
pared to receive and digest them.
Earlier tluin the regular time the
stomach is unprepared, for it has
not had its necessary rest. Later
than the regular time the oppor
tunity is lost, because tlie desire for
food disappears as if food had

We may reasonably hope that the
developments^ which the past Jias

advances in armor and armament
of vessels of zvar, may find their
counterpart in the future develop
ment and improvements of sub
marine vessels of all kinds.
Of the future of vesseU^of this
class it is not possible to speak with
entire certainty, because of the 'pos
sibility, or even probability, of im
provements in other lines, which
will directly affect the submarine
vessels. To be entirely successful
it is. necessary that a submarine
boat adapted to naval purposes
should have a high surf ace speed, a
reasonable submerged speed, per
fect control, both in the vertical and
horizontal plane, when on the sur
face or stibmerged, efficient ventila
tion of the interior, satisfactory ac
commodations for the personnel,
and a considerable field of vision
when submerged. .What has al
ready been accomplished in the sub
marine vessels at present in service
both in this country and abroad
demonstrates the entire practicabil
ity of obtaining all that is desired
in many of these features.
years most determined efforts have
been made to produce vessels cap
able of meeting the chief require
ments of such craft. There are at
the present time several types of
vessels said to be capable of success

Positively avoid a habitual diet
composed too exclusively .of one
kind of food, such as meats or cere
als; such a diet leads inevitably to
disease. Many cases of sickness,
palpitations, scurvy, skin diseases
and headache are directly due to
this improper diet.
In selecting an ordinary mixed
diet the occupation of the. individual
or family should, as far as possible,
be taken into consideration. For
instance, a person who performs
hard zvork, zvalks or rides a great
deal en horseback or bicycle, can
easily dispose of a rich or.concen
trated diet. Whereas, he who docs
little manual work, sits most of the
time, and takes little or no exercise,
consumes but little, and therefore
needs little of the concentrated
foods. An abundant diet, consist
ing chiefly of the concentrated
foods, is quite unappropriate to the
latter, and leads to gout, obesity,
gall stones and predisposes to apo
plexy.
Among the albuminous foods zve
find . that those most concentrated
are the meats, eggs, cream, cheese,
gelatin and gluten flour, while milk
and the stalks and leaves of vege
tables are dilute. It is a notc
zvorthy fact that eggs partiada?-ly,
and milk to a cei'tain degree, are
complete foods in themselves, that
is, are the most suitable single
foods, for they contain all the nour
ishing principles required for the
maintenance of life. Milk, hozv
roer, as single food is suitable only
for infants and sick patients.
The most concentrated' starchy
foods are rice, oatmeal, cornmeal,
wheat, corn, barley, sago, tapioca,
rye and arrowroot. These cereals,
zvhen made into bread, become less
concentrated, and in this form rank
zvith beans, peas, lentils and chest
nuts. Potatoes and parsnips are
the most dilute of the starchy foods.
Oatmeal should not be taken oftener
than three times a zveek.
By animal food is meant meats,
fat, poultry, game, fish, eggs, but

fat or butter is necessary in the
diet.

. (Copyright, 1900, by
IT* is said that the best behaved
children are those which exist
in the imagination of unmarried
women, theory children, so to speak.
It is needless to say that such per
fect creatures are not to be met in
every-day life.
With few exceptions, the ordinary
child's life is governed by an exceed
ingly loose rein. Children are allowed
too much indulgence, and always in
the wrong direction. There are very
many instances in which children
early learn to take advantage of ;an
indulgent parent, and in the learning
are fostered deceit and other evil pro
clivities. The child who comes to
know that petty thieving ) will be
overlooked by an appearance of con
trition is laying a splendid founda
tion for a life of crime and its inev
itable punishment, and, poor little
mite, he has nobody to warn him.
A careless bringing up is the cause
of many a failure in life. Children
who are accustomed to rule a house
hold expect to rule the world by the
same arbitrary methods when they
become men and women. Defeat they
accept as they took opposition from
their parents â with^a very bad grace."
They generally refuse to make an
other attempt with different-; meth
ods, and there you have the failure.
Should you spend time to analyze
the causes of a large proportion of the
divorce^ cases, you' would undoubtedly
find that over-indulgence in child
hood plays a very important part.
The wife has been a petted, spoiled
daughter^ and, with an exaggerated
opinion of her own importance, ex
pects her husband to assist in main
taining it. Perhaps he, too, had been
spoiled by foolish parents, and ex
pected ( more from his wife than she
was able to give. And an unthinking

better, and simplicity cannot obtain
where there is excessive fussiness. A
healthy child has few â¢ needs â food,
sleep and recreation are about all out-?
side of the necessary clothing. Food
is provided by the parents with the
clothing, nature looks after the sleep
ing part of the programme, and the
child is able to furnish its own recre
ation with a little assistance in the
niatter of toys and opportunities to
use them.
Children should early be taught
the value of regularity in meals and
slumber. There should be stated, pe
riods for both, and nothing of a
trivial nature should be allowed' to
interfere with either. Positively, a
child's health and happiness depend
on these two habfts. It is better to
arrange the meal hours so that chil
dren can be fed by themselves until
their table manners have been formed
and their presence will be a creditable
addition to the family table. . Believe
me, this Is. the easiest way in which
to teach the use of napkin, knife, fork
and spoon.
Fearlessness is a trait which chil
dren bring into the world. It is killed
out by parents and attendants who
seek to. rule children through fear. It
is a precious) gift which ought to be
fostered to maturity, for it is the best
weapon with which to fight for "suc
cess. The fearless child is' usually
the truthful, honest youngster who
grows into an honorable mamber of
society. Nobody has ever been able
to explain why the possession of a
fearless spirit keeps at bay the mean
little traits which often bring ruin in
later years. But everybody acknowl
edges the fact. :
Respect for elders is not a com
mon trait among American children.
The Turk honors his mother above
every woman in the world, -and
shows . it by remaining in her pres-
ence in a standing position and with

observes with no 'other woman. The

I would love to have a valentine for my
very own." â¢ â¢ â¢ . Just then she saw
lying In her path an envelope on which
were printed the words "Open me." With
much surprise she stooped down, and
picking it up, opened it carefully, whenâ
out Jumped a tiny man, no bigger than
her thumb, and he was all dressed in red,
and had tiny red hearts on his coat, no
bigger than the nail on her little finger.
In her surprise she almost dropped him,
but he was not to be easily shaken, so sat
pÂ«rched on her sleeve and addressed her
In the tiniest voice she had ever heard.
"So you are the little girl who wants a
valentine? Well, well, we shall see. Are
you willing to obey me?" V : ; t
"Why, I guess bo," Bald Dorothy, for
the little man had such a,, delightfully
pleasant face that she felt sure he' must
have a good heart back of It. He then
produced a teeny, weeny silver heart and
gave it to her, Baying: "Take this heart
and go home and get your supper and go
to bed, but do not say a word to any one
about It, and when your mamma is asleep
go and pass this heart three times over
her head, and then she will not awaken
until you have had a visit to St. Valen
tine's Land.
"Oh, can I really go to St. Valentine's
Land? The land where the valentines
retlly grow?" Bhe asked, and he said:
DOROTHY was a poor little girl,
whose mother worked very hard In.
order to get enough for them to
eat and to clothe the child and send
her to school. Very often they did not
have enough to eat, and Dorothy was so
poorly clad that Bhe Buffered from the
cold.
Lately she had heard her little school
mate* talking eo much about Valentine's
flay. What a lot of mystery and fun and
whispering there was. to bÂ« sure, and as
Bhe heard the children talking about all
the people to whom they were going to
eÂ«id valentines her little heart ached with
childish sorrow, and she did wish with all
her might that she, too. would get a val
entine, or, better etlll, might be able to
buy one of the bright, pretty things and
give It to her mamma. But what could
Bhe do? She could not ask her dear
mamma for money to buy one, because
she had no money to give her, and she
knew It would only bring one more Bor
row to the dear mother heart, so she
Etudled her lessons, and was as pleasant
and kind to every one as If her little
childish heart was not aching over the
thought that Valentine's day would not
mean anything to her, as it would to her
light-hearted little playmates.
Well, school was over at last. and Bhe
walked home alone, feeling cold, hungry
and unhappy. Her eyes were fixed upon
the ground, and she was just saying, "It's
JUST now there seems to be an un
usually large number of baby heirs
to millions and titles. There Is the
three-year-old Marquis of Bland
ford. Â«on of the Duchess of Maryborough,
formerly Miss Vanderbllt. who Is already
beginning to recognize that he is not like
other babies. Some day this little fellow.
If hÂ« lives, will be twice a Prince, a Duke.
a Marquis, twice an Earl and twice a
Baron. He will rule over 23,000 acres of .
land, be lord of Blenheim Palace and In
herit a good share of the Vanderbllt mil-,
lions. \
Another little) English boy who will Â£
come Into a rood thins when be prows up
Is little Charlie Lennox, who one fine day
will be Duke of Richmond with a variety
of other titles. Including: two more duke
doms, and will inherit nearly as much
land as there is In the two British coun
ties of Rutland and Middlesex. Along
with this fine propery go four magnificent
country houses In England and Scotland.
Another Infant not old enough yet to bÂ«
a playfellow of the son of little Marlbor
ough is the one-year-old Earl of Breck
nock, who now toddles about the halls of
Bayham Abbey. This little fellow will
one day be*Marquls of Camden, twice an '
Earl, a Viscount and a Baron. He will
have nearly thirty square miles of real
estate, a fine country seat in Kent and
another In Wales.
A playmate of the little heir of the Van
derbllts and the Marlboroughs is the lit
tle Viscount Weymouth. who feels him
self quite a man. and has a pony of his
own. being: 5 years old. He will one day
be Marquis of Bath and draw a revenue
from 66,000 acres of land.
Lord Por Chester, heir to the earldom of
Carnarvon, to 36.000 acres of land and four -'â
great country seats, Is only 2 years old.
and. of course, is looked upon as a mere
baby by my Lords Blandford and Wey

The future Duke of Portland is 7 years
old and is heir to an estate larger than an
English county and five splendid homes,
including the historic Welbeck Abbey.
The future Dukes of Bedford and
Sutherland are boys of 12. They will
some day share between them thirteen
peerage tltlea, nine lordly seats and con
siderably over 1.650,000 acres of land.
The Marquis of Stafford, now 3 years
old. Is heir to the largest estate in tho
United Kingdom, for the Sutherland acres
would make a compact estate 100 miles
long and more than twenty-one miles
wide. The estate contains 63.000 more
acres than the entire county of Lanca-
Among the playmates of the Marquis
of Blandford may be mentioned the Earl
of HJHsborough. who will one day be ,
Marquis of Downshire. He is 6 years old
and is three years older than his father - "
was. when he succeeded to the marquisata

ward to an estate larger than the county
of Rutland and many titles of nobility.
Of the same age as the Earl of Hills

an estate of 30,000 acres of land In
Jamaica, valuable mines in England and

girl, still dressed as a fairy and holding
out the big valentine and rare flowers to
her. She opened the valentine, and out
fell a great heap of gold moneyâ and. oh,
what smiles chased away the sadness
then. How she kissed dear little I>oro-~
thy as she told her all about It; and then
Dorothy began making wishes and tap
ping her hand with the little silver heart, ââ
until their poor little home vanished 'ami
In Its place appeared a perfect palace. Just
filled with beautiful thlngs-and all be
cause of an obedient little Ctrl and tha
good St. Valentine.
*Tes, you shall, for you are a, good and"
obedient little girl, and I never take any
other kind to that beautiful country-
Farewell until to-night."
She falrlv trod on air the rest of the
way home, singing all the way, "O I am
to happyâ so happy." When she reached
home her mamma met her at the door
with a kiss, and said: "What makes my
little girl have such a bright, happy face
to-day, and where did you get those two
big, red roses In your cheeks?" Dorothy
only laughed the more! and said", "O, I
feel happy to-day, mamma." She flew
around, helping about the work, and it
seemed to her she would never get supper
over and get to bed. But mamma was
unusually tired that night and retired
early. Little Dorothy waited until she
b&w her sleeping, and said: "Now for
the little silver heart: we will try It."
And she slipped over to mamma's bed and
did as St. Valentine had directed. Then
she hurriedly put on her clothes again,
and Just as she was all ready there stood
the little man before her, and taking her
by the hand passed a gold heart three
times over her head and she became as
email as he, and hand in hand they Jump
ed through a tiny hole in the window.
"Lady Dorothy, my carriage waits," he
Bald, and she saw the cunnlngest little
carriage, about the size of their sugar
bowi; and It was all red, and two tiny
red horses and a coachman dressed in red
and gold.
"Away to St. Valentine's land," he
called out to the coachman, and on they
flew, swifter than the wind, and it was
bo delightful to go through the air this
way that Dorothy laughed till she held
her Bides, and Jolly little St. Valentine
laughed, and even the tiny horses laughed
and the coachman heard them and he
laughed. It was all so perfectly lovely
and Dorothy was so happy. And oh! they
passed through the queerest . countries.
Some of the houses were upside down and
the people standing on their heads, and
horses and all kinds of animals walking
on their backs with their feet in the air,
and children walking on their heads and
the blue sky was underneath and the trees
on top. Dorothy said: "Why, what coun
try Is this? It makes me dizzy to look at
It" St. Valentine replied: "It is the Up
side Down country. They don't mind 1L
They have always been that way, you
know." Dorothy said: 'â¢Well, anyway, I
am glad that I live in the Rightside Up
country."
Next they passed through the land of
Giants, and oh! how tiny she did feel as
she looked away up to the people who
were as big as trees. She could not sea
their faces, they were bo far away, so
the coachman stopped the carriage and
8t. Valentine produced a very fine ladder,
and he and Dorothy placed this ladder
against one of the big giants and r raa
clear up to the top of it/ hand in hand,
and peeped right Into the giant's face and
said, "How do you doT'. The giant tried
to brush them off with his hand, and
caid in a voice like thunder, "Those ', hor
rid mosqultos are such a nuisance," and
St. Valentine fairly roared In his ear, "O
I don't know," and the giant looked f bo
funny. Dorothy laughed, arid said: "Mos
quitos! Indeed! "Well. I never thought
I should ever be called a mosquito." '" And
then they ran down the ladder again, but
thy looked In wonder to see whence It
came; and discovered that many of the
cupids who were flying through the * air
had harps and violins and other kinds of
musical instruments, and as they' played
they "would produce the most wonderful
harmonyâ more beautiful than any that
Dorothy had ever heard. It made her feel
! like dancing, and she was delighted when~
a little group of fairies, all dressed in red
gauze, wl th . silver ; and gold hearts . scat
tered all- over their 'dresses, approached
her and said, altogether: "Will you dance
'with us, fair maidenâ the dance of the
.Valentines?", Taking her rapturous smile
to mean-yes, they took her hand, and as
soon as they had touched, her she looked
down and saw that she, too, was dressed
In red gauze with gold and 'silver hearts.
And, oh, such beautiful little red Blippersi
Away they went, in the merriest' dance
that was ever danced. : No mortal child
could' ever dance that way. She must be
a â¢'really" fairy Just now; and. oh. how
perfectly lovely it was to be a Valentine
fairy. One felt as light as a feather, and
could have laughed and danced forever.
The music rose high and sweet above the
merriment, and St. Valentine danced on
in front of them, until at last they came
to the most wonderful tree â It was the tree
where the valentines grew; and the fairies
grouped In a ring around it and danced
nnci sang. Dorothy seemed to ha # ve known
the words and music always, and she
sang with the others, until' St. Valentine
waved his wand and they all stood still.
and a long silver wand was placed in 'the
eager hands of each little fairy. They
were all little girls. Just like Dorothy,
who had been so good. that St. Valentine
not until Dorothy had seen that his eyes
were like two big windows and his hair
like a field of wheat. .
She looked In at some of the shop win
dows and saw great sticks of candy, as
big as a small tree. "Oh, If I had just one
of these," she said, "It would last me all
my life." They Jumped 'Into the carriage
again, and on they sped, stopping a little
while in "Animal Land," where she. saw
something muoh . nicer than the circus
monkeys by the score playing the funniest
pranks, and elephants doing the "cake
walk," and kangaroos dancing the "skirt
dance," cats and mice sleeping sweetly
side by side and a lot of lions and lambs
having a bJg frolic In- the most friendly
way Imaginable. Birds sang and dogs
barkedr and food for all the different
kinds of animals grew on trees and
bushes, -while clear streams of water
flowed through the land. But they could
not tarry long, for they must hasten on
to the end of their Journey. â¢ â¢ â¢ The
Fcehe changed. There were miles of tho
most gorgeous flowers, with beautiful but
terflies, many-colored and as large as din
ner plates, hovering over them. The air
was filled with the rarest perfume, and
flying all around among the beautiful
â¢trees were .little cuplds, with sliver bows
and arrows. They kept shooting at every
one they saw, but it did not hurt a bit
only made one feel very happy. Finally the
coachman stopped and opened the door;
they had reached St. Valentine's Land;
aitl there was a red velvet carpet spread
out for their feet. St. Valentine passed
the heart over Dorothy's head and his
own, and they became their usual size.
All the air was full of music, and Doro-
had changed them into fairies for Just
this one night. Each one was given a
large golden basket by one of the Attend
ant cuplds, and then with the silver wand
she could. reach even .to the very top of
the big tree and point to the valentine
she liked best,, and as soon as she
touched It It would fall off and fly; right
into the basket, and as fast as It fell off
another one would grow in Its plf ce, bo
that- the tree was never emptyl This was
more fun than anything of which Doro
thy had ever dreamed, and she got enough
valentines for every person she had ever
known In all her little life, and oneâ such
a beautiful big oneâ for dear mama. . St.
Valentine Emlled In a very pleased way
when he saw the one she had selected for
mamma, and said It was the very one he
had intended for her mamma. And It hap
pened that the valentines the little girls
selected for their mammas were all Just
alike, and very fat and heavy. Finally all
the golden baskets were full, and the
children were all allowed to remain the.i
natural size, and when they- bad said
good-by all around they saw a very large
red carriage and very large red horses
waiting for them. So each one was bun
dled In, with many good wishes from St.
Valentine and with all their golden bas
kets full; for each mamma a huge bouquet
of flowers, such as they had never before
seen.
Away they whizzed, stopping nowhere
this time, but In haste to be home before
dawn. Each little girl was safely deliv
ered, and finally Dorothy reached her own
little home. She still 'had the silver heart,
and St. Valentine had told her whenever
she wished for anything to tap three times
with the heart on the palm of her left
hand, and her wish would be gratified.
So after the coachman had opened tha
door with a little golden key, she ran up
stairs and waved the heart over her
mother's head, and she awakened.
What was her surprise to see her little

KNOXa very respectable, nice little nose.
Frequently I se* a child with a one
sided, lumpy head, and I know that I
hare before me a poor little creature who
has. been robbed of his birthright, phys
ical symmetry.
Many, Infants present themselves tÂ» m
more or less admiring family on the occa
sion, of their first appearance with dis
tressingly distorted and bumpy heads.
There are physical reasons for thes* ec
centric looking little pates, and nature
will assert her authority without other
assistance In most - cases. Occasionally
the -little bead fails to acquire a proper
roundness, and then the hands of th*
mother or nurse should assist in smooth
ing away the- unnatural and disfiguring
lumps.- \
"Wnere the head Is long and narrow and
one-sided, a gentle pressure of the hands
with a movement from toe chin to th* top
of the head will often repair this distor
tion In a few weeks' time.
The pressure should be firm, never hard,
and never painful to th* Infant.
The human countenance U of very flex
ible material and Uttle children who ax*
allowed to make grimace* very *ooa
show the effect of facial lines that later
on destroy th* harmony and beauty of
the countenance. I
On* cannot begin too early to oppose
and counteract all such habits in children.
So far as the mouth is concerned the
form of this feature depends greatly upon
the care bestowed upon the teeth in baby
hood. It la never too soon to begin to
take care of a child's mouth, and it is
well, for mothers, to understand that a
baby s teeth require brushing and rinsing
and were never interded to be removed
by decay.
A child should shed its first baby teeth
at about the eighth year, and if they have
been properly cared for these little teeth
should drop out without a defective speck
on any of them.
If the early teeth are looked after they
will nerve until the Jaws are sufficiently
grown and strong to produce teeth capa
ble of doing service for a lifetime, and
these teeth will come in regular and beau
tiful, unices there is some inherited de
fect cither in the formation of the Jaw or
the failure of some of the chemical con
stituents.
. TREATMENT FOR SCALD HEAD.
Wash the little bead each night before
bedtime with a pure soap, rinse and dry
it with a soft towel, then apply the
pomade made as follows:
Resorcin. 4 grains; lanolin. 8 grains;
vaseline, 8 grains.
Let the ointment remain on all night,
wash it away in the morning. with pure
soap and repeat the application of the
unguent if necessary. Usually it suffices
to anoint the head all night only.
If the baby bÂ«; troubled with what is
called "prickly heat," perhaps you dress
him too warmly. Try loosening hla cloth
ing and also making it a trifle lighter.
Dissolve a small teaspoonful of bicar
bonate of eoda In his bath. This Is excel
lent. You might also bathe the affected
parts with diluted witch hazel, uslnra,
soft linen cloth or velvet sponge.
FROM childhood we Impose upon our
feet, making them conform to a
shape in shoes, decreed by fashion
and quite at variance with nature's

After the lotion has dried rub. the foot

dion, one ounce. Paint over the corn or
bunion every day once or twice, and after
five or six applications tha superficial
growth can be scraped off.
No. 2â Salicylic acid, one drachm; co
caine, five grains; collodion, one-half
ounce. Paint over the corn or bunion
twice a day,' and scrape., away the super
ficial growth at the end of three or four
days. Â¦
The following recipe will be found good
for the treatment of chilblains:
Camphor, one drachm; beta-naphthol.
ten grains; cocaine, five grains; diachy
lon ointment, one ounce. After bathing
the part in hot water balsam of copaiba
Is painted over the surface.
For tired and tender feet try bathing
them in hot water into which a big hand
ful of sea salt has been dissolved. ..Let the
feet remain in the water fifteen minutes.
Dry and rub the soles with a half-lemon.
The relief is most grateful.
Either one of these two formulas will be
found effective for excessive and odorous
perspiration:
No. 1â Oleate of zinc, one-half once:
powdered starch, one ounce; salicylic acid
one scruple.
No. 2â Beta-naphthol, one-half drachm;
distilled witch hazel, four ounces. AddIv
well to the skin.
The following formulas represent good
.prescriptions for the treatment of corns
and bunions:- ;
Above all things avoid short shoes. They
â¢are the causes of that obstinate and pain
ful trouble called Ingrowing toenail. The
best shoe is that which is long and broad,
with the sole projecting as much as one
eighth of an inch beyond the foot. Avoid
extremely sharp-pointed shoes. Happily
they are no longer in fashion; and the
woman who has a square foot need not
pinch her toes In order to be correct.
A soda footbath is as effective as any
other treatment for burning feet. Take a
handful of common washing soda and let
it dissolve in a large foot tub two-thirds
full of tepid water. Soak the feet in this
bath for twenty minutes. Usually It will
remove the burning sensation and give
great relief.
Iodine should never be used on the foot in
its full strength. .
Distorted gr^at toe joints are always
caused by shoes too short for the foot. To
relieve the pain and throw the Joint back
into place put a bit of thick felt between
the great and second toes. To massage
the sore joint always hold the toe In place
by separating the great and second toes.
This of itself will give relief. Never mas
sage the great toe joint by a pressure that
will bend the great toe still further to
ward the second toe.
This movement Is shown in the illustra
tion "to remove a droop in the eyelid."
The movement is made with the third fin
ger only of either hand, and la vibratory.
This is the rotary motion, as shown in
the diagram. It is reversed in the work
on the brow, but always backward on the
temples.
It has been said that a woman cannot
afford to shed many tears after she is"
five and twenty, or if she does it will be
at the expense of the beauty of her eyes,
as the lachrymal glands are relaxed by
weeping and the orbicular tissues (the
orbicularis is the circular muscle of the
eyelid) become emaciated, causing the dis
figurement known as drooping eyelids,
nothing but the most skillful manipulation
can restore the contour of those delicate
tissues.
The first picture show? the movement
for obliterating horizontal lines and fur
rows in the brow.
The skin combines within itself the pow
ers of an organ of excretion, secretion,
respiration and nutrition. After it has ab
sorbed the skin food it requires it will
accept no more for the time being, and
the operator may commence the smooth
ing-out process. All ltne<Â» should be
smoothed out: that is. they should be
treated with the thumb and forefinger in
an opposite direction to their formation.
My own masseuse says:
"In giving massage the patient's face is
first bathed in warm v.-ater and carefully
dried with a soft towel. I use a little
cream or skin food to anoint my fingers
during the treatment."
before a woman gives herself massage
she should study the plate given in this
book, showing the muscular construction
of the face and throat, and she should
recollect that the muscles must be devel
oped by the exerciseâ which is given
them in the various motions. All the im
portant facial and throat muscles are
manipulated, the operator anointing her
fingers with a tissue or skin-feeding un
guent, or skin food, which ha's usually a
basis of lanolin, because of its penetrat
ing qualities, and is gently rubbed into the
skin. It is quite wonderful to see how
gratefully the skin accepts nourishment In
this way. I am never tired of watching
and marveling at the sensibility, the re
sponsiveness and the power of its resist
ance.
needs facial massage, even $1 is far be
yond her means, and in such cases the
subject may do the work herself on her
own face and it is work and not play, let
it be understood, and fatiguing work, too,
when properly done.
The word massage is derived from the
Greek masso, to knead. It does not, as
many alleged operators appear to con
sider, mean to pinch, or punch, or bruise,
or beat the tender flesh and nerves until
the victim is as tore as a pugilist after a
prize-light.
Where the muscles are much relaxed
they are actually sensitive to the touch,
and they suffer punishment at the first
treatment -if they are properly manipu
lated.
Most women begin to show age by a re
laxed condition of the muscles of the lieck
and throat, and no woman, I am sure, has
ever sesn this first sign of advancing
years without a linking of the heart. I
do not hestitate to say that by care the
contour of the neck and throat can be
positively restored to the firmness and
beauty of youth in all cases where there
is not some wasting disease and where
the subject Is not over CO years of age.
Hollow cheeks till out In an amazing
way when this manipulation is properly
and persistently given.
The manipulation of the cheek muscles
Is a sort of clawing movement. The mus
cles must be accurately located and the'
motion light and quick. Generally speak
ing, all facial massage movements are
outward and upward. I
The operator must know how to locate
these muscles, beginning at the origin of
the trumpeter's muscle and manipulating
upward to- the predominating muscle
above the ear. finishing the work on this
muscle with the rotary movement, which
will force the circulation through- the re
laxed muscles, invigorate and rebuild the
tissues. This movement, in connection
with the manipulation of the mahler or
cheek muscles, will completely obliterate
the lines of care, but in giving these
movements special attention must be paid
to the chin, as the contour of this most
Important feature can be diminished or
abnormally enlarged by improper manip
ulation.
â¢ The proper movement for developing the
predominating muscle of the face is
shown in another Illustration. The prin
cipal muscle of the cheek, called the trum
peter's muscle, is a flat muscle which
forms, the wall of the cheek. It derives
its name from its being much used in
blowing the trumpet. But several other
muscles enter into its formation, and
these become relaxed from a disorganized
system, sluggish blood and many other
causes. The glands shrink, the fatty tis
sues emaciate and then we have sunken
cheeks.
Another illustration shows the move
ment for removing laughing wrinkles.
Laughing wrinkles are not disagreeable,
r-m they certainly make a woman look
older.
The temporal muscle is the one to be
operated upon. The muscle is fan-shaped.
Its fibers arise from the aponeurosis of
the forehead. The operator must exercise
great skill and care to locate this muscle,
giving it the proper rotary movement,
thus forcing the blood to the surface,
which will nutrify and rebuild the fatty
tjssues and restore the temple and nasal
contour.

There have, indeed, been cures of seem

If a shrunken arm may be restored to
symmetry and perfect contour, why not a
shrunken cheek? Obviously one result is
as logical as the other. The great difficul
ty is that in treating an arm or a leg we
follow our physician's advice and secure a
scientific masseur; but for some inexpli
cable reason we trust our faces, whose
delicate anatomy and muscular structure
we know next to nothing about ourselves,
to the first woman whose sign "facial
treatment" or "facial massage" meets our
eyes on the street, and who is just one
degree more ignorant than we ourselves.
No woman is competent to give benefi

studied its anatomy, knows every nerve
and muscle in Its construction, and has
practiced thÂ» giving of facial gymnastics

the professors of the Swedish school.
I suppose I am acquainted with nearly
every so-called method of giving so-called
massage in this countrv. It Is utter noa

is only one real way of properly adminis

after the school founded by the great
Ling, the originator of the system. Where
a woman can afford to employ a skillful
masseuse of course she should do so.

opened and the Old Groceryman, carry-
Ing In both hands an enormous white box
containing cut flowers he had purchased
at an unheard of price from an uptown
florist. On the box's cover was written:
"TO A CHEERFUL GIVER."

the box on the astonished clerk, "take this
to your boss with the compliments of the

Just then one of the porters ''em-
ployed in the buildingâa wizened, stoop-
ing old manâcame out of Mr. Sage's in-
ner office .where he had been sweeping.
On sight of him the Old Groeeryman
<irew back the box and rushed upon the
newcomer and hailed h!m with effusion.
"Take it!" he shouted. proudly. "Mr.
Sage, take this here box as a slight token
of my opinion of you. I calculate It3
contents will surprise you some. Careful,
there!' Don't you let it drop!"

the box and hart opened his lips to pro-

not "to let the box drop, he and the clerk
Jumped as If struck by lightning. Mem-
ories of bomb-throwing cranks rushed to
their minds, and the porter laid the mys-

it contained-thin-shelled eggs and bolted
for. the hallway, screeching for help at
the ton of his lungs.
"Well, I declare!" simpered the grati-
fled Groceryman. "If Mr. Sage ain't so
pleased that he's run off to tell his other
friends in the building!" Â¦â¢
But before the old man could think fur-

fellow, bore down upon him and pinioned
his arms behind his back.

flung the protesting victim to the floor

"Shut up!" counseled a patrolman, en
forcing his command by a prod of- his
billy. , . .
The captain was carefully opening the
box, holding It a foot under water, while)
everybody else modestly tried to hide be
hind his neighbor.
The next moment the captain rose to his
feet amid a howl of laughter and started
for the old man.
The Groceryman traveled through space
at the rate of sixty miles a second and
landed in the arms of the Bad Boy on the.
pavement outside.
"Mr. Sage Is so suspicious," explained
the Bad Boy soothingly, as his old friend
gazed at him with deep suspicion. "Since
people began dropping bombs in his office
he thinks every present Is an Infernal ma
chine. "When he learns it was only & box
"of flowers he'll no doubt write you a nice
letter of apology and Invite you around
to one of his sumptuous office luncheons.
And now hurry up, or we'll be late for
that grand annual leap from the bridge.
Chief Devery won't be likely to wait for
us, you know. So put a move on."
They passed y.p Broadway, which thor
oughfare en all holidays Is but a pathetlo
ghost of Its usual thronged, noisy, hust
ling self.
"Why. where's all the crowds to-day?"
aFked the Old Groceryman as they turned
Into City Hall Park and trod the almost
deserted plaza.
"The whole city has boarded tugs and
other river craft, or gone down to the
docks, to watch the Jump," replied the
Bad Boy. "Now. my own idea is for us
to watch the leap from aboveâ on the
bridge itself. If we go to the docks there'll
be such a crowd we can't see a thing."
They reached the New York terminus.
and, dodging the triple semicircle of cable
cars at the "loop." came out on the
bridge promenade.
It was the Oid Groceryman's first visit
to Brooklyn bridge, and he gazed admir
ingly down the upper bay toward Staten
Island and the Statue of Liberty. So lost
In admiration was he that he did not no
tice that tha Bad Boy had left his side for
a moment.
The Bad Boy approached a bridge po
liceman, and slipping $3 Into the blue
coat's hand. whispered that the Old Gro
ceryman was his uncle from the country,
who had come to New York to be cured
of suicidal mania and who had declared
his Intention that day of Jumping oft
Brooklyn bridge.
The policeman promised to keep an eye
on the unfortunate old man, and In return
for the Jo not to arrest him, but merely to
give the Old Grcceryman a good scare.
Then the Bad Boy rejoined his old friend
and together they proceeded along the
promenade, followed at a distance by tha
policeman. Â¦ .
"You say Chief Devery Is to Jump from
the central span?" queried the old man.
"Yes." returned the Bad' Boy, "and do
you see that tug away down there? "Well,
that's the one that's going to pick him
up. It's almost under the bridge already.
So he must be getting ready to Jump.
Hurry up, or we'll miss It."
"Here's the place!" shouted the old man
in high excitement, pointing down to th*
southern carriage roadway. "See that
span of horses drawing that brewer's wa

"It is a day." proceeded the Old Gro

and theft, "on which every true man.

reminiscently. "that I was fired from my
first Job on "Washington's birthday. But
I don't recolltvrt just now whether it was
done with patriotism or not. By the way.
Isn't there a question you want to ask
about "Washington's birthday?"
"Well. yes. there is." assented the old
man. "But I kind of hesitate to ask it.
because every time I ask you questions
and then act on your instructions I seem
to round up in Jail or else get mistaken,
for a harmless crazvtic"
"That's it! That's right!" grumbled the
Bad Boy. "Go ahead and blame me for
your own foolishness. I give you a.
straight answer anJ then you get it
tangled up and go to work and blame mo
for it. Answer your own questions In fu

returned to the sedulous reading of the
morning paper.
"Now don't get woozxy." pleaded the
Old Oroeeryman. "Like as not I was mis
taken. The question I wanted to ask you
this time was: 'How do New York folks
celebrate "Washington's birthday?* "
"I'll tell you." said the Bad Boy, "anl
I'll prove what I say this time, by read
ing It from the newspaper. You know if
you eee a thing in print It's bound to be
true. So when I read part of the pro
gramme for the day you'll understand
I'm telling the truth. Now listen." and
the Bad Boy read slowly and distinctly
the following, pausing now and then to re>
fresh his imagination:

ported "the" ring" had met. Then fortune
played a strange prank In the proceed
ings, which both helped and hurt her. It
chanced that a burglary was being com
mitted that same night In a residence al
most directly opposite. The servants
were awakened, gave the alarm and a
fusillade of pistol shots rang out. on the
midnight air. Of course 'all thÂ© household
era In t the neighborhood were awakened
by the racket and ran forth to learn the
cause of all the confusion. The servants

for a moment she' was the cause of.it.
She was paralyzed with fright, but only
for an Instant. The next the quick-wit
ted girl realized that the uproar was. a
golden' opportunity offered to . take ad
vantage'of the desertion' of the servants;
then she fell upon the desk containing the
Valdes deeds stolen from her father's
house. â¢
With them safe in her pocket sha made
â¢deeds were offered to her at a fancy
flrure. The arch-conspirators had figured
that she would snap at these forgeries
and use them for the purposes of winning
the suit. Of course at the proper moment
they were prepared, to step in and dra
matlcally'prove the deeds to be gross for
geries. Fortunately, Flores. got wind of
the. matter and warned Miss Banning In
time. But the trick, though It failed In
execution, produced one momentous re
sult. It revealed the' headquarters of the
plotters, and by a rare chance showed
that the bona-flde Valdes deeds were lit
the same place. But how to get them?
Jessie Banning knew that her father's
eecrets' had been sold out time and again
to the other aide, and she was afraid to
trust anybody with the . important task
of recovering the deeds. Whoever got
them for her might turn and offer to re
sell them to the other side for ready cash.
In this dilemma she decided to try and
recover them herself. There was. "only
one way. Court . processes were useless
In trying 1 to reach her enemies. She must
do as they did when they took them from
her father.. /

forgetting for the moment that the gar

by the householders, seeking the burglars
who had fled from the alarmed house
across the way. Unfortunately for her
she was observed as she dropped, lightly
from the window and a vigilant servant
fired a pistol at her. The ball graced her

the warm blood.- but felt also that even
If she was seriously hurt she must make
every endeavor to get the Valdes deeds
Into safe concealment before she was cap

darkness, followed by the shouts of tho<w
in close pursuit.
Suddenly, In her mad flight, she stum

met near the water; one carelessly threw

of delight. It was Flores' favorite air and
she had often heard him softly whistling:
it to himself in that self-same way. Â¦
"Flores. Scnor Flores," she called softly.
The shadow and the whistling suddenly
stopped. "Senor Flores," she repeated,
and the figure advanced cautiously to-'

Jessie Banning might be called a San
Francisco girl, though she was born in
Peru. Very early in life she was brought
hf-re by her mother and attended the pub
iio school, where Fhe formed many ac
quaintances. It was through her mother
that she inherited the title to the great
stretch of valuable forest lands which
were so long In dispute. Jo* Banning, her
father, was very well kncwA in the Men

region and came to this city for rest ani

and he. fel! rfrsperately In love with her.
Marriage quickly followed. He took a
wedding' trip with her to Peru to visit
her relatives and "see what kind of a
country it was. "anyway." Being a timber
exprrt. he became keenly alive to the
rrcsp'cts of that country in furnishing
fln-e woods, and when he saw the rich belt
that his wife held disputed title to he
was ready to jump Into the contest with

JEFSIT: BANNING or Ban Francisco
has Just won a great triumph In her
long contest for the rich mahogany
trip along the -west elope of the
Cordilleras in Peru. Though she lost her
father, ruthlessly shot down from am
*ush In the bitter strife, and her beloved
mother, who died from grief and despond
ency, she won a husband and a fortune.
Indeed, but for the timely and stanch as.
pittance of Georges Flores it is doubtful
whether she ever could have won against
the machinations of the rich and Influ
ential rnen who were determined to cap
ture the great mahogany tracts valued
at l.aw.OOd soles. When, disguised as a
boy, she was wounded in trying to re
cover the highly important Valdes deeds
In order to. prove her title, it was Flores
who aided her to escape the hirelings who
had her eurrounded. When the Valdes
deeds were recovered, it was Flores who
shrewdly preserved them till they were
called for by the courts, though detectives
and cutthroats were ransacking the pos
sessions of everybody connected with the
cate.' threatening the weak-hearted and
even kidnaping those that were thought
to knew the whereabouts of the deeds.
Despite all their wildest efforts, the deeds
were preserved and triumphantly present
ed to the court at the opportune moment,
and the wedding of Jr-psle Banning and
Georges Fiores dramatically closed the
loss and-excitinc coniest.

little. daughter, she fled from Peru and
again came to San Francisco to visit her
sister. But her heart rvas broken. She
pined away and in three years she died.
JesEle was kept at school here till she
graduated, then she went back to her rel

she began to hear the stories about the
strife over the tracts of valuable woods
and the reasons why her father had been

her. She spent all her spare time going
over the records and the evidence, and

LONDON,' Feb. 16.â The hopes that
the turning point of the war in
South Africa is within sight, now
Inspiring the market, are prob
ably doomed to disappointment.
The pacification of the Boers, if accom
plished, will be a slow matter, which
decisive engag-emements can affect but
little. The War Office expects from Gen
eral Kitchener no stroke such as settled
forever the hopes of the Soudan. The
heads of Great Britain's War Department
scarecly know any more than the public,
except that the- stern, laconic commander
of the troops in South Africa Is busily en
gaged In systematizing his huge forces for
an extended campaign. In him they trust
Implicitly and np amount of taciturnity
makes * their faith waver, though they
read with regret articles leading the pub
llce to believe that the Boers are likely to
be soon muffed out by one or several en
gagements. During the months General
Kitchener has had the command in South
Africa, he has been applying his energies
to prepare for events six. months hence
rather to dealing with the emergencies of
the present.

Tlih _a tilth northwest wind and a big

to carry the water of an eight-inch main

the flooding no further action can be

f up that any cf the men in shaft Xo. 6 are
B'Jll alive. The fire continues to burn
'fiercely. Xo man could approach within
UO feet of the place where the explosion
occurred at the bottom of the shaft.
Premier Dunsmuir to-day received a re

President, wh~bT3 thesole arbiter* of -this

will call the fifty-seventh Congress to

told EomÂ«5 of his Congressional callers to
day that he would in all probability call
an extra session for March 15, the same
date fixed _f or. the extra sesslon_of the
fifty-fifth Congress four years ago.

enduring: friendly relations -with, the
United States, and their constitution will
not be objectionable to this Government
But he will express his views In 'a. mea

with the legislative branch of the Govern
ment. He desires that all causes for sus
picion shall ,be, removed at the earliest
possible date and Cubans be allowed to
proceed with the organization of their
government with the least possible inter
ference from this Government.. But > he

ter'to have the constitution submitted to

The objections urged against an extra

President Is trying, however, to keep all

peace and prosperous Â¦ conditions of this
country. He is as desirous as the' cham

PITTSBURG, Feb. 16.â It#ls understood
that C: M. Schwab, president of the Car
negie Company, was really the man who
consummated the great Carnegie-Morgan
deal in which a number of matters 'came
up that threatened seriously to overturn
all negotiations, but which were removed
by the tact of the Carnegie president. It
is said that Mr. Frick will receive $22.5C0,
000 In" preferred stock, and .$22,500,000 In
common stock. In -the ' same- proportion
the capital of Â«the Carnegie Company will
Increase from $160 ,00u ,000 to '$480,000,000.

greatly from that of Mr. Donnelly. Ac

"Wo trusted Frank implicitly-," said
both Platt and Letts at the City Hall
last night. "He has been cashing these
checks for us ever since he came Into the
employ of the . company. He. played the
races once in awhile when he had a day
off; and we thought he might have gone
yesterday, to one of the tracks." -
"No," said one of the ladies who ac
companied the men to the City Hall, "I
do not think so. Frank said he knew of
better opportunities .and often spoke of
Manila. Possibly he went away on the
Sherman."' -> v : â¢
Assistant Superintendent. Donnelly tel
ephoned to his wife at 954 Geary street,
asklng-her If she had seen Frank at the
racetrack. She answered that she had
not. Donnelly said last night:
"1< rank has been in the employ of the

months of the time being spent here. He
was a man of excellent reputation. He
had about eight or nine checks, the total
of which as Tar-as I can learn amounted
to $545. We fear that after receiving the
money r he met with foul play. I, lost noth

Shortly after his installation .he was
given checks to collect. He always made
prompt return to his fellow employes, un

On motion of Allison the Senate decided
to consider until 1 o'clock unobjected bills
on the calendar. Under thau order the
following bills were passed:
Referring to the Court of Claims the
claim of William K. Woodbridge for com
pensation for use by the United States of

txceecing $147,000, but to include only
legal bonded indebtedness.
At 1 o'clock the sHip subsidy bill, as the
unfinished business, was laid before the
Senate. Spooner demanded recognition
and moved that the Senate proceed to
the consideration of what is known as the
oleomargarine bill. . The motion was
agreed toâ 45 to 3â "Senators ChUton of
Texas and Vest of Missouri casting the
only votes in the negative.
Hale of Maine, appealed to Proctor, "in
tow of almost unanimous vote" by which
the oleomargarine Mil was taken up, to
permit a vote to be taken upon the meas
ure immediately. â¢ - -.
Half a dozen Democrats were on their
feet at once. Berry, gaining recognition,
eaid: . Â¦
"I want to. ssy to the Senator from
llajne that the 'almost unanimous vote'
to take up tbe bill was not because the
Senate is* unanimously in favor of it, but
it was In order to ret ria of, set aside and
give- a black eye to the ship subsidy bill."
"Not that they love Caesar less," sug
gested Hale, smilingly, "but they love
Rome more." (.Laughter.)
Proctor of Vermont, chairman of the
Committee on Agriculture, from which the
oleomargarine bill was reported, made a
statement as to the bill. He was of the
opinion that the enactment of the bill
would put the oleomargarine business
upon a sound and hoLest basis, and In
this end the oleomargarine manufacturers
would be the better for the change.
"16 it the object of this bill." inquired
Vest of Missouri, "to Collect revenue, or
the end the oleomargarine manufacturers
ture of oleomargarine?"
"The measure shows on' its face," replied
Proctor. v that it ,is partly for the
collection of revenue* â¢ and partly for'
the protection of the honest' butter prod
uct."
"I want to know," Inquired Stewart, "if
the principal object <*f this bill is not to
raise the price of dain- butter and thus
Impose upon the common people?"
"I think." responded Proctor, "that it
will have a very slight effect in that direc
tion."
The discussion took a rather humorous
turn when Proctor and Tlllman began
comparing their respective experiences in
dairying. Proctor said he had milked 2jO
cows and had had fifty years "of dairy ex
perience.
Tillman said he used to carrv his but
ter to market every Saturday and he went
from the dairy to the Governor's chair.
The South Carolina Senator declared
that the restrictions on coloring should ap
ply to butter and oleomargarine alike, and
he causfd much amusement by the vehe
mence of his denunciation of "axle
grease" and all other decoctions, connec
tions ana contraptiona put off on the pub
lic, although he held that if a purchaser
wanted axle grease he was entitled t->
have it. â¢ ..

Jones of Arkansas offered a resolution

By a practically unanimous' vote^-only
two Senators voting In the hegatlve^the

consideration of the measure "It- was""laid.
afiide In order that the unobjected . bills.
on the calendar might be considered.
Xearly 200 bills, including 175 privatcpen
tlon bills, were passed during the day.-
'The 1 addition of 30 per cent to the duty
will, it is thought, prove practically pro
hibitory. The action taken to-day means
that the Russian will not
concern itself with a- test caste nor await
the issue of such a ease. However, there
Is an expectation that the American im
porters of Russian sugar will make the
fight on their own . interests. Some car
goes of Russian sugar are now afloat and
on the way to the United States, where
at least one is due to arrive in the next
ten days. It is not doubted that the con
signees in the United States will, rather
than pay the countervailing duty, which
would make It impossible to compete with
other sugar, make up a test case. If the
issue favors the Russian side, then the
obnoxious decree will be amended, though
it Is not decided that the' Russian Gov
ernment feels offended. The text of the
Russian order is as follows:
; An~ order of the Russian Minister of
Finance directs additional tariff of 30
per cent net imposed upon articles in
cfuded In paragraphs 150, 151, 152, 153, 161
and section 2, discrlminatfng tariff, upon
American hardware, iron, steel, boilers,
pipes, forgings. castings,, tools, gas and
water meters, dynamos, sewlqg machines;
paragraph 167 of the Russian tariff laws,
when such articles are of American manu
facture. This includes motors and ma
chinery of all -kinds .

It is realized that a grave crisis has been
reached in the trade relations of the

effect of the "Russian decree; when it be
comes operative on March 1, will be to in

These goods already enjoy two separate
reductions, "30 per cent being taken off

L.ODI, Feb. 16.â Excursion rates made
by the Eastern railway lines are having
their effect here. Yesterday five families
arrived from South Dakota to look for
homes In this neighborhood. -The party
numbered twenty persons. Â¦ Another party
numbering about a hundred has gone on
to Los Angeles. All are Germans, many
of whom speak but little English, and all
are possessed of money. They will be
driven through the surrounding country
in order that they may see Just what the
neighborhood of Lodi has to offer to
homeseekers.

and relatives. of the late arrivals. More
than a hundred have located here within
the last two years. They comprise what
Is known locallyas "the German colony.*.'
Each has his small farm, ranging from

never settled here. Their holdings bloom
and bear continually and are a marvel

GAGE VETOES ATTORNEY^
GENERAL FOBD'S BILL
State's I/eg-al Counselor Is Deprived
of an Extra Clerk for
' His Office.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 16.â Assemblymen are talk-
Ing of the Governor's veto of Assembly
bill 81, and the "horse" that is on Attorney
General Ford as a result. Tha bill was
drawn by the Attorney General, to auth
orize him to appoint an additional clerk
for his office, and the reason given for its
veto is that the Attorney General neg
lected to codifv it. . .
In the aggressiveness shown by Ford In.
his advocacy of the mining debris bill
there is a possible explanation of the veto.
Some of the legislators closest to Gov
ernor Gage opposed that measure and tho
men who fought hardest for it are not
high in his esteem. Ford's course did not
make him more popular with the adminis
tration, and some are saying that the Gov
ernor embraced the opportunity to humili
ate Ford by criticizing the form of his
bill. i
The wider significance of the veto Is,
that now the precedent is made, all meas
ures that are not -codified will â¢ be Â¦ vetoed,
unless, possibly, their Importance shall
cave. -them. The. Governor's message re
garding Assembly bill 81 concludes as fol
lows: ; â¢
"Without 'expressing any opinion upon
the advisability of increasing the present
number of clerks in the office of the Attor
ney General, I respectfully call your at
tention to the fact that the proposed act
is in the form of a. general law, but It re
lates to and should form- part of section.
475 of the Political Code of - the State,
which section provides for the number of
clerks in the office of the Attorney Gen
eral; and. therefore, according to sections
249 and 2aO of said Political Code, a duty
devolved upon tho Judiciary Committee of
property and- the Probate Court' of â¢ this
county made the order. Shields' mother
in-law bought the property, for $1400 and
afterward transferred It to the defendant,
who now holds it â¢ .-.."Â¦
'Miss Zanker asks to have .the deed set
aside on the ground' of fraud and wants
$4000 damages for its retention. As evi
dence of premeditated fraud on her
uncle's part, the plaintiff recites that a
year ago.the Superior Court of this county
set aside a lease to some land Shields had
obtained from her by fraud.

(T MENTO, Feb. 16.â The eommit-
VV v tee ' 8 substitute for Schillig's coun-
ty division bill will come before
the Assembly some time next
week, and it probably will pass, foryall
kinds of county division schemes are be
hind it and none of the opponents oX
county division seem to be taking any
Interest in the measure.
The bill is the old kinder bill. Introduced
in tne Legislature come years ago by
Senator LJnder. It was remodeled. by the
committee for Its own use,. but the salient
points of the measure have been retained.
It Is introduced by the committee as a
general law In accordance with the pro
vision of the constitution which provides
that the Legislature may pass general
laws for the division of counties.
It is provided that when a certain sec
tion of any. county wishes to make of it
self a new county. It shall first appeal
to the Governor, who shall then appoint
a Superior Judge from an adjoining coun
ty to take testimony in regard to the
advisability of separation, and to adjust*
the proportion of the debts of the old
county which shall be charged to â¢ the
new one In case separation be allowed.
Upon the showing of the Judge that the
separation is advisable, an election la
call** in the new county to be formed,
and if two-thirds of the Inhabitants of
the Intended county favor separation,
then the new county Is formed. There is
nothing in the bill which allows the par
ent county to have any say In the mat
ter of separation. Any section with 5000
population can make application to be
declared a new county, and if a favorable
report be obtained from the Judge and
the necessary number of votes be gath
ered in, the section can separate from Its
parent county and the parent county need
not be consulted.
The bill was reported as a substitute by
the Committee on Counties, but as a mat
ter of fact none of the members of the
committee except Assemblyman Brough
ton knows anything about the measure.
The chairman. Cromwell of Sonoma
knew nothing about the provisions of the
bill, and MUlce knew nothing even about
its presentation : as a committee substi

IN SOME CASES
A Single Package of the Pyramid
Pile Cure Is Sufficient to Cure..
. This' may seem a broad statement when
It iÂ» remembered that few diseases are
so obstinate to, really cure as Spiles, some
physicians going so far as to say that a
painful surgical operation Is the only per-
manent cure; but the many and remarka-
ble cures made by the Pyramid Pile Cure
in the past few years have proven that
surgical .operations, are no. longer neces-
sary, and that it Is by far the safest and
most reliable remedy yet discovered for
this common and often dangerous trouble.
j The harmless acids and healing oils con-
tained in the Pyramid Pile Cure cause the
biood vessels to contract to a natural con-
dition and the little tumors are absorbed
am' the cUre Is made without pain. Incon-
venience or detention from business.
â¢ Dr. Williams,- a prominent official sur-
geon, says: "It is .the duty of every sur-
geon to avoid an operation if possible to
cum in any* other way, and alter' many
trials. with .the Pyramid Pile;Cure. I un-
hesitatingly recommend it in preference to
an operation.'! . .....
Mr. Phil Owens of. South Omaha writes
that after- suffering Â¦ two years from : an
aggravated' case of itching -and' protrud-
ing piles he was cured by a single, 60rcent
package ' of : the Pyramid Pile Cure pur-
chased I from Â¦ a i local druggist. Â¦-Â¦ He says:
"I "fully , expected . the trouble | would re-
turn, but/am happy to say: for -the past

warmly in favor of the Pyramid Pile

W.. WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â Porto Ri
can soldiers want to go to the Philippines
to help put down the insurrection in those
islands. This fact was brought out to-day
in the -debate in the House. Steele of In
diana said a battalion of native Porto Rl
cans which was coming to Washington to
participate in the inaugural parade 'was
the equal in physique and army tactics of
any American soldiers, and its members
were anxious for duty in the Philippines
or anywhere else. The matter came up
through the vigorous protest made by La
cey of Iowa, who, said it was inhuman
and cruel to compel the attendance of
Porto Rican soldiers at the inauguration
of President McKinley, as they Were un
accustomed to our usually severe March
weather. Major Steele said he had let

-COLUMBUS, O., Feb. 16.â Governor
Nash was asked for an expression in re
gard to the prize fight between Jack Bon

He said that he had first noticed the af
fair in the newspapers this morning, hav
ing been so busy with the Cincinnati af
fair that he had not had time to give at
tention to the smaller pugilistic events.
He stated that he considered the Youngs
town contest of a character which he
did not propose to permit if he could help
it: He had ho doubt that when he took
the matter up with the Mayors of the
different cities that' an understanding
would be reached and co-operation be ar
ranged whereby all such contests would
be* suppressed.
It is the Governor's intention, as soon
as he can find the time available, to pre
pare a circular letter to the Mayors and
probably to the Sheriffs,> calling their at
tention to the decision of, the courts at
Cincinnati and asking that they assist
him in preventing in the future the hold
ing of prize fights at any point in the
State of Ohio. It is probable that the
letter will be prepared and forwarded
some time next week. .

TOPEKA, Kans.. Feb. 1G.â Mrs. Carrie
Nation Is no longer laughed at in Kan
sas. The Jokes of the first few days or
her crusade have died on the lips of tna
Jokers, and now uneasiness and alarm
possess these men. Mrs. Nation's worlc
Is spreading rapidly. j; '
A druggist spills his stock of HÂ°. uo Â« ln *Â°
the gutter in front of his store to delight
and encourage several hundred of the
prohibitionists. A saloon-keeper ac
knowledges his conversion and closes ms
place. In another part of the State liquor
sellers, warned by the angry public, pacK
their belongings and leave the town, ine
events of three weeks in the State are sig-
Mrs. E. B. Hoffman of Enterprise,
whose son is Mayor of the town. Invited
a visit. The two women stoned ; three
saloons in Enterprise and destroyed
everything in them that was of value. In
Anthony twelve women went out win
stones in their aprons and ha tel^tsln
their hands. They demolished four'
saloons, wrecking $2000 worth of propertj.
Husbands went alongv to protect them.
Three schoolgirls, daughters of raiders
accompanied them and helped in the work
of destruction. -
A Law Enforcement League for Reno
County was 'organized at Hutchinson to
enforce prohibition laws. A committee ol
"leading ladles" of the town visited the
saloon-keepers and told them if they 1 did
not close their property would be de
stroyed. . ' '
From all over the State come reports of
saloon mobbing by women., Topeka Is
"dry." No drink can be had unless at the
drugstores and druggists use greater pre
caution than ever before in selling liquor.
The Attorney General of the State has
been made to understand by force of
sentiment, and his conduct since Mrs. Na
tion came to Topeka has been in accord
with that sentiment. The Chief of Police
of Topeka and the Sheriff of Shawnee
County have become very industrious in
suppressing the liquor traffic. They have
given saloon-keepers a certain time in
which to move their Illegal property from
the city. The District Judge has issued
ten injunctions restraining saloon men
from selling liquor and property-owners
from renting their buildings to them. In
the Legislature the effect of this ".Na
tionism" is seen. This week the Senate
advanced the prohibition bills of Hurrell
of Jackson to the first place on the calen
dar. The Senate passed the most im
portant of these bills at a special meeting
âone of which, if it becomes a law, will
make the prohibition laws in Kansas
much more stringent. <
Â¦ There was a free for all fight at Beloit
this afternoon resulting from the feeling
over the closing of the Joints. The tem
perance men and women insist upon
making an inspection of the â¢ places to
see if the orders regarding closing have
been obeyed. The Mayor allowed three
or four to enter a place at a time and
sent an officer to see that no dam
age was done; The Investigating com
mittee was by d large Â¦ crowd.
Soon an alarm of fire was sounded and a
hose ~ cart dashed up and . commenced
throwing water on the crowd. Some men
attempted to cut the hose, but were pre
vented by a display of revolvers. After
some nersons had been more or less hurt,
a few arresta were made and quiet re
stored. V
Chief of Police Stahl to-day filed charges I
with the City Council ; against Police
Judge Magaw and asked for his removal
from office. The - Chief charges the
Police- Judge with collusion wltji the jolnt
ists and conspiring to prevent harmony in
the police force.
WICHITA. Kans., Feb. 16.â A dispatch
from Wellington to-night says that all the
jointists in, that city obeyed the demand
made upon them by the temperance mass
meeting early in the week by quitting
business at 6 o'clock this evening. The
town Js absolutely quiet to-day.
Sheriff Simons of this county searched
Wichita to-day for Mrs. Nation, "having
heard that she was here, with a warrant
charging her with inciting a riot during
her previous visit. Up to . 11 o'clock he
was unable to find her. 1 It was reported
that sho arrived here this morning and
that she was sequestered by her friends
to avoid being arrested.
VALENTINE, Neb., Feb 16.â A band of
women belonging . to the W. C. T. U.
visited the saloons to-day and warned the t
proprietors against maintaining gambling
devices. As local license is in force they
will â¢ rot disturb liquor . selling. Out
hatchets will be used if gambling con

KANSAS CITY. Kans., Feb. 16.â Before
daylight this morning seventy-five men.
led by the ministers of this city, went
across the Kansas River to a plac*Â»
known as ''Last Chance," a joint, and
wrecked it. The bartender, who was
found asleep, was seized hy two men and
forced to the corner of the building,
where at the point of a revolver he was
compelled to witness the destruction of
liquor and fixtures. The mob went to
work with axes, hatchets and clubs,
within a few minutes every piece of fur
niture In the place was destroyed and all
the liquor turned out. The mob did Its
work quietly, and on finishing I left for
home in an orderly manner.
â¢ The joints In this city have all been
closed for several days. The "Last
Chance" la Just . outside the city limits.
The temperance people have threatened
two drug stores unless they quit selling
liquor, and a mass meeting has been
called for to-morrow to tako decisive ac
tion. ,

A NEW DEPARTURE
Cure for Catarrh.
A New, Effectual and Convenient
Of catarrh remedies there is no end, but
of catarrh cures then} has always been a
great scarcity. There are many remedies
to relieve, but very few that. really cure.
The old practice of snufling salt water
through the^noRe- would- often relieve and
the washes, douches, powders and in-
halers in common use are very little, if
any, better than tho old fashioned salt
water douche. Â¦> ; "
The use of inhalers and the application
of sajves. washes and powders to the noso
and throat to cure catarrh is . no mora
reasonable than to rub the back to cure
kidney disease. Catarrh. Is'Just as much
a blood disease as kidney trouble or rheu-
matism, and it cannot be cured by local
treatment any more than they can be.
To cure catarrh, whether in the head
throat or stomach, an Internal antiseptic
treatment Is necessary to drive the ca-
tarrhal poison out jf the blood and sys-
tem, and the new catarrh cure is designed
on this plan and tbc remarkable success
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is because
being used Internally It drives outca-
tarrhal ' Infection 'tlirough action upon
stomach, liver and bowels.
Wm. Zimmerman of St. Joseph relates
an experience with catarrh which Is of
value to : millions ,of catarrh sufferers
everywhere. Â¦ He -says. Â¦ "I- neglected a
slight nasal catarrh until It gradually ex-
tended to my throat and bronchia] tubes
and finally ,even mv stomach and Uver
became 8 affected, l but â¢ as * I was able to
keep up and do a dny's work I let It -un
along until my hearing began to fail me
and -then I ; realized that I must get rid
of catarrh 'or 'lose my position, as I was
clerk and my hearing 'was absolute! v
; "Some -of my friends recommended an
Inhaler, another -a catarrh salve," but they
were no good in my case, nor was any.
thing' else until I heard of Stuart's Ca
tarrh I Tablets â¢ and bought a . package at
my drugstore. Â¦ They benefited me from
the start and. in, less than four months I
was completely cured of catarrh, although
I had suffered nearly all my life from It.
I "Ihey are pleasant to take and so much
more convenient to use than other catarrh
remedies. that Ifeel I cannot say enoueS

We treat absolutely nothing but genlto-urinary diseases of the male,
such -as Kidney and Bladder Diseases. Wasting Drains, Loss of Vital- Force.
Nervous and Chronic Diseases. Piles, Fistula, Rupture, Hydrocele. Varlco-
cele and all contracted diseases.
The man who devotes his whole time to ONE THING becomes an EX-
PERT in time. The physician who follows a particular SPECIALTY can do
better for his patients than the one who is trying to cover the whole field of
medicine and surgery. The time has come when the DOCTOR, in order to
compete in his profession, must confine himself to limited field.
We have jriven 20 years to the treatment of disorders peculiar to men. and
are prepared to prove that this specialty is second to none In Importance. It
there la one subject in the world which requires study, experience and skill,
this one certainly does. Healthy generative organ3 are as necessary a3 a
healthy heart, lung or brain. Unhealthy generative organs are the direct
cause of more disturbance of the affairs of this life than any other thing
that exists. This is a fact, and is too tree. Thousands of men are afflicted,
with sexual disorder which could be promptly cured. They do not under-
stand that one of the most important nerve centers In the human body pre-
sides over the generative- organs, and that excesses, early abuses, con-
tracted disorders, varicocele and kindred troubles are continually disturbing
this nerve* center, producing Ios3 of vital force, prematureness, disordered
function, chronic inflamed prostate gland, general loss of energy and Interest.
both In business and society. This Is not a subject to be passed over lightly.
IT IS IMPORTANT BEYOND DESCRIPTION. ..
The great secret in our treatment Is, first. In making a correct diagnosis;
and, second, skill In selecting the proper remedy, regulating the dose, habits,
diet, sleep, exercise, etc.â in fact, doing the right thing at the right time
explains the whole secret of our success, and also the reason why we cure
our cases after they have been through the hands of those who do not under-
stand this special line of disease.
To reason further, a very large majority of patients who apply for treat-
ment' havÂ« been led by Ignorant doctors to believe that they have a weak-
ness, whlchon examination proves to be an Inflammation of the prostate, and
have been treated with tonics, stimulants, electricity, etc., all of which make
the Inflamed prostate worse instead of curing the disease.
A weakness Is always due to some debilitated condition of the system.
while nearly'all cases of Inflamed prostate are found in comparatively
healthy, robust-looking men. whom no one would suspect of any trouble.
Judging by general appearance. The inflamed prostate Is caused by excess,
contracted ailments, dissipation, etc We can cure this prostatic trouble la
every caae and thus put the organs In normal condition.

The process of laving the new pavement
on Grant avenue has attracted much at
tention during the past week and has
elicited many words of commendation by
experts and contractors. The Board of
Public Works, composed of Colonel Men
dell. C. E. Grunsky, Marsden Marison and
Augustus Maguire. have for months been
investigating methods of paving approved
by other- cities, and were determined to
obtain for the city's streets a paving that
would stand the most severe " tests and
insure the greatest permanency. The con
sensus of opinion derived from their in
vestigation's In Eastern cities was in ef
fect that the method employed by the Al
catraz Asphalt Paving Company of this
city would more nearly till their require
ments than any other. It'was accordingly
given the contract. â¢ The paving differs
materially from any now In use In San
Francisco . and promises to fulfill every
confidence reposed in It. * '
Constructed to Last.
At a meeting of the Stablemen's Union
held on Friday night a schedule of wages,
to t*Kln on the lim of next month, was
adopted. The rate Â¦<? fixed at $2 a day;
with the Â¦ privilege of the men rooming
and boarding where they see fit.
The Hackmen's Union, after consulting
with the owners of hacks, have decided to
resort to the original price of to for driv
ing to San Mateo cemeteries. Lately $6
was the price charged.
An effort will be nUde by the Carriage
Blacksmiths' Union to shoiten the hours
of work of the members. This union is
among the mere recent organizations, but
has more than 140 members.
From the reports of unions as read
â¢weekly before the San Francisco Labor
Council through their delegates a satis
factory feeling exists between employers
and employed of all the branches of in
dustry. Among the more recently organ
ized unions are thoso of the retail clerks
and the barbers, and Judging from the
progress made- by both this city Is in a
fair way to maintain Its position of giv
ing to the employes of thesw trades
shorter hours fur work with an assurance
of no reduction In the wage scale. The
clerks' organization, with -400 members,
has behind Jt the families of the mem
bers, besides their numerous friends, who
are ready to espouse their cause In de
clining to patronize aoy storekeeper who
may persist in keeping his place of busi
ness open after fi o'clock in the evening.
This union, like that of the barbers, ha*
passed through the probationary period
and Is now a giant of strength in the
community.. The barbers are jubilant at
the good news of â¢ the passage of their
bill through both Â¦ houses of the Legisla
ture and its almost certainty of getting
the Governor's signature, with the ap
pointment of J. J. Calish of this city as
one of-the board of. examiners.
Another sign of tho popularity of the
unionized trades can be seen in the in
creased attendance of delegates at the
Labor Council. Two years ago from
twelve* to fifteen delegates were all that
could be mustered at a meeting, now therfe
are more than 150 members present at the
usual weekly meetings of the council.
Heretofore the organizing committee,
consisting of five members, was able to
dispose of the work allotted to It At
the last meeting of the council the com
mittee was Increased to twetity..
Employers Seem Generally

Conditions. .

For some weeks there has been much
friction between Â«.ne*boss teamsters an i
their men as to the hours of work and the
rate of pay. Three months ago the team
sters organized and their union I3 now
recognized by the Labor Council. A con
ference waa called for last evening at thu
Builders' Exchange, and though the
teamsters had a committee present, tne
boss teamsters had only two members of
their committee to meet the men. It was
agreed that a cdnference should be held,
however, but it resulted in nothing dettn
lte. The teamsters want the abolition of
the boarding houses' maintained by their
employers. Hours of work fixed from' 6:30
a. m. to 5:30 p. m.;and pay running, fron
(2 3 to 12 50 per day. At present tile men
are being paid from %\ to il per day anc
their board. The principal objection 01
the men Is the boarding system . main
tained by their employers and they claim
that they should be allowed to live wheio
they please and not forced to board whero
their employers designate. ; â¢ *,

The rr.er-ting at which the injunction

NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â A temporary In
junction Â¦was served to-day on the officers
of the smelting and refining company who
were present at the company's meeting in
Jersey City, restraining them from in
creasing the capital stock. The injunction
will be argued next Tuesday before Vice
Chancellor Stevens. The officers of. the
company desired to increase the capital
stock In order to take In the Guggenheim
refinery.
The complaint on which the temporary
injunction was issued alleges that the
American Smelting and Renninj^Company
had no surplus or working capital on Jan
nary 1. EMI. :>nd that instead on that
date its capital was actually and to a con
siderable extent impaired. It is also al
leged in the complaint that the Guggen

SIO.imO. and that the purchase Is proposed
to be made by an i?.=ue of new stock of
the American Smeltina and Refining Com
pany to the extent of f 10.00" .000 on a ba
*:s of 80 per cent for the preferred and
50 prr cent for th*> common stock. It is
also declared in the complaint that the
proposed purchase would establish a com

art's Tablets show that one irraln of the
active principle contained In them is suf

the most widely known of any treatment
for stomach weakness.
This success has been secured entirely
upon its merit* as a digestive pure and

Stcart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entfre-ly

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
When Sarah Bernhardt was In the c'.ty
pome : "ars ago she gave a breakfast to
Forte of her friends at the California
Hcttl. It was served about noon and
there were but three persons present be-
Fidcs herself. In the midst of the repast
a ecl! boy knocked at the door and said
that there was a man downstairs who
refused to give his card and insisted en
coming- up to see her.
-Let him come, then," was her reply.
The call boy explained that he was a
tough lookjng tramp and might be crazy.
"â¢Never mind his looks or his clothes,
he may be a. friend of mine," was the re
ply.
In a few minutes a man of about GO
or more-: entered the room. . He was very
shabbily dressed, had not shaved for a
â¢week and hla shirt front was well gar
r.'.shed with tobacco juice. The Instant
Jiernhardt saw him she gave on exclama
tion and bounded forward. She threw her
pelf upon his neck and covered his rough
face with kisses. The man was Mr. Levl,
a turner, who died recently In this city.
Many of The Call readers will remember
his short, heavy figure as he used to walk
the etreets with furs throwp over his
thoulder. looking for 'customers.
Bernhardt at once made a place at the
table and b*gan opening champagne for
her guest. She introduced him as an old
friend from Paris and explained that
when she was a child and her family
Â¦was In straits Mr. Levi Â¦ JÂ»ad cared for
them all one winter and kept them from
absolute want.
Every few moments she would jump up,
Â£iasp him about the neck and kiss him
again Rnd again. There was no acting
about these embraces. 6he was glad to bee
him ?.nd she wanted no misunderstanding
on that score. Presently she asked him
why he did not go bock to Paris and see
his relatives. He answered sadly that he
was not able.
"Oh, that Is easily remedied," she said,
end a moment later she had written out
a check for $1300 and thrown it across the
table to" him. He picked it up, and when
he saw the "amount he broke down com
pletely. With the tears streaming down
his cheeks he said:
"Sarah. I didn't come here for charity,
but Just to see you a few moments."
He handed the check back across tha
table. â¢ . â¢
"Oh, not enough? I make It bigger."
She wrote, another check for $2000 and
thrcw.it over .to him. â¢ He. looked at the
rccond check and merely said:
"Give me the other, Sarah." .
She smiled as she handed It to him.- and
then the old" man did a magnificently in
dependent thing. He slowly placed the
two checks together, tore them Into bits
and handed the fragments Â¦ back to- tbe
xnadame.
"No. 'no, Sarah; no money. Just your
gratitude; that is all I ever wanted."
Then she was at his side again, kissing
bis tears away and sobbing herself. It
vas a very pathetic scene and one not
GENEROSITY OF BERNHARDT.
easily forgotten by those who witnessed
It. She said that she would' "fix him
yet" in that peculiar -way of hers, which
always means that she intends to have
her own will. â¢ â¢-*â¢â¢Â» '..?'
Some months later I was In San Fran
cisco and met old Levl waddling along
the streets with his furs. â¢ He stopped
me and said he wanted my advice.
"I have Just got a letter from Sarah."
he paid, "and I don't knowwhat the devil
to do about It." He translated the letter
as he read it, and It went something like
this, as near as I can recall it: "You tore
up the last check I gave you, which was
very mean of you. I was very angry at
the way you treat my checks. No one
else ever did such a thing to me but you,
and you make me angry every time I
think of you and your, treatment of me,
Tou humiliate me before strangers. They
must have thought that my checks were
worthless, or you must have thought so.
I now enclose another and larger one. It
Is for twenty-five hundred dollars of your
American money and If that Is not big
enough Bend it back and I will make it
larger, but some chock of some denomina
tion you must accept and If I gave you
all the money I ever earned It would not
repay you for the time years ago In Paris
you saved me from want. I shall expect
you to come to Paris at once and be my
guest. Answer yes by cable and make us
all happy. If you do not do this you must
never call on me again, as I shall refuse
to receive you. Affectionately..
"SARAH."
"What shall I "do?" asked the old man
with tears in. his eyes. "She Is bound to
have her way. x She always was that way
as a child."
"Better send the dispatch and then cash
the check and go to Paris."
"I guess I'll have to," said the old man.
and he started for the telegraph office.

NEW YORK. Feb. 18.â Th* following

In the leisure and rest of to-day the good people* of San'Francisco should not overlook the
fact that to-morrow, the gamblers will make another effort ; to; obtain , from the Supervisors the
privilege of resuming poolselling and bookmaking at Ingleside track. Consequently one of the
duties of to-day is to resolve to attend the meeting of the board to-morrow to protest against 'the
wrong and defeat the scheme.-
It is understood that, the acts to secure this needed legislation were drawn by the attorney
of the Harbor Commissioners, and have the approval of Â¦ that body as well as the business com
munity. It would seem to be sufficient to satisfy the members of the Legislature that the Harbor
Commissioners request this legislation, and with the backing of the commercial bodies it will be
strange if any opposition is, developed to its enactment, and it will also tie interesting, in such an
event, to consider the names of the members so opposing.and their probable motives for so doins
. . â¢ . - . â¢â . , o â¢
It is conceded By all the commercial bodies of the cijy, after a careful consideration of the
subject", that the lease is. a good one, that it will save an expenditure of over $350,000 to the State
and be very beneficial to the immediate business demands of the city. They have so expressed
themselves in petitions to the Legislature for favorable action upon the bills presented by the Har
bor Commissioners, arid in an open meeting held last Friday at the office of the Commissioners,
when a committee of our representative men was appointed to visit the capital and present this
matter to the Governor and the members. of the Legislature.
. It is estimated by the chief engineer of the board that. the cost of. this seawall will exceed
$350,000, and the State will be benefited to that extent, as it would otherwise be soon
to build this wali with its own funds to meet the increasing demands of commerce along the
water front. The advantages to the railway company from this wall are that it gains additional
harbor facilities, which are greatly needed, and avoids the . interference ;with its traffic arrange
ments which must necessarily occur should the State, by a failure of the Legislature % to act, be
compelled later on. to construct this portion of the seawall in front of the leased premises in China
Basin. ' .. '
THE lease of China Basin to the San Joaquin Valley Railway Company,, which caused so
much public discussion for several months while it was-under consideration by the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners, is now before the Le'gislatureMJndcr this lease the railway com
pany takes the use of the basin for the term of fifty years under authority conferred upon the board
before it was made, and no further legislation is needed -as to that portion.. By another provision
of the same instrument the railway company undertakes to build a seawall in front of the basin, a
distance of about twenty-four hundred feet, if the Legislature ratifies that arrangement.

The musical event of the coming week

Jackson, the , violinist, and formerly a
resident of California. Miss Jackson Is
scarcely out of her teens, but has already
won j an enviable reputation for herself
as a violinist. As a child' she was sent
abroad* to. study by George M. Pullman.
Mrs. vGrover Cleveland and others, and
the wisdom of their investment has been
amply proved, according to the critics,
who have commented ' most . favorably
upon tho'work of this youngr woman. As
Miss Jackson was engaged for eight con
certs In one season by- the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra, .there 1 seems little doubt
of her ; attainments, and ; she is accom
panied ', by Josephine Klburna, a soprano
of note; arid Selden G. Pratt, pianist. Miss
Jackson will appear only in two recitals,
to-morrow. and .Wednesday affernootis, at

'As to , the famous GodowÂ»ky para
phrases on the Chopin Etudes: Aa ona
prominent musician" cays, "They look
better than they sound.". Of their tremen
dous technical difficulty and remarkable
Ingenuity there can' be no two opinions;
their muslcalncss is another question.
One curious feature about the matter is
that no one has accused their author of
impertinence, and neither Is there the
least .suspicion of Irreverence about the
paraphrases. But if Chopin had wanted
them that way he knew enough to have
written ; them . In- that fashion: and that
his was the only way was amply proved
when Godowsky played paraphrase and
etude proper on the same programme.
â¢ Other less familiar numbers given here
were - the "Variations on a â¢ Norwegian
Theme" of Grieg, the Chopin B minor
Bonata, E flat- , minor "Scherzo" of
Brahms, ballet from- "Alceste," a Salnt-
Saens arrangement of the. Gluck and a
brilliant "Contrapuntal Paraphrase" by
Godowsky himself on 'Weber's "Invita

As before said. Godowsky can play the
piano. Ho has every quality of the art

an almost undreamed-of technical capa
city, the soul of a poet and. the mathe

than his tone It Is Impossible to conceive.
Limpid, velvety, allky soft In the planls
slmos and round and rich with no threat
of harshness In the loudest fortes. It Is
deliriously- satisfying. . His technique Is
almost -laughably - fadle. a, marvel and
continual wonder. All the ordinary diffi
culties of the Instrumentâ octaves, double

In the finer difficulties. of polyphonic- tech
nique each part Is colored and weighted
with as much smoothness and beauty as
If the pianist had a. half dozen Instead of
only two small and wonderful hands. In
terpretation of course comes In here, and
Godowsky's readings are as amply satis
fying 1 as the rest of his work. If there is
a lack in his equipment it Is In a last re
serve of physical force In the climaxes,
and even that, in the tremendous render
ing of the "Wagner-LJzst â¢Tannhauser"
overture, with -which he closed his last
recital, was lost sight of. He has the
epic rather than the lyric Inspiration,
purely, poetic and without the least trace

marvelous, the minute perfection of the

and his recent visit to that city *as the
signal for an enthusiasm rarely aroused
In that stronghold of the hardened review

the critics have been dreaming? It is true
that Godowsky can play the piano, but
of other earmarks of "the greatest pian
ist of the age" he has none. He h^j not
a mannerism to his name. He neither
flings his clever hands heavenwards, nor
droops a supple wrist in Delsarte. curves

favorite Chopin movements. His hair,
too. Is absolutely unmusical. Black, snort,
curly worn even as thino and mine. It Is
hopeless from a plantstlc. standpoint.
Then, too. the player brings with him no

and. worse than all, this last discovery

For these reasons, largely, Mr. Godowsky
at hla first recital here last Tuesday was
heard only by a half houseful of musi

even fewer persons, and on the third af

MISS LEONORA JACKSON, THE
TALENTED. VIOLINIST, WHO
PLAYS TO-MORROW.
MME. SARAH BERNHARDT.
WORLD-FAMOUS FRENCH
ACTRESS.
The will of the people was validated and inscribed as quietly and dispassionately as it was
declared, and no sycophants offered lip service, nor did any mob, shortened in food or .clothing or
liberty, howl and roar at the gates.
Power had returned to the people and had by them been passed back to the v hands into which
they had committed it before, and no man in- all the republic was hindered in his career,
obstructed in his business, hampered in his benevolence, nor harmed in his fortunes by the
process. Liberty remained unbound and glorious as the sunshine that gilds her helmet. As the
simple ceremony passed it recalled no past bitterness, but only the extending line of distinguished
sons of the republic who, by thesame simple forms, have been declared chosen of the people. It
brought no repinings of dynasties overthrown, pretenders in exile, popular uprisings, passion and
violence black-handed reaching for power through blood and fire, but only memories of a succes
sion of administrations that came and went as orderly and as beneficently as the seasons.
As royalty has endured in Spain, in Holland, in England, and its ritual arid ceremony are
unchanged, .so may freedom, with its simplicity and . sincerity, its popular forms and absence
of glare and gauds, endure forever. y
At Washington the representatives of the people and the Senators who represent the States
*in this free society have met under the forms of law made by the people and in the manner thereby
prescribed have counted the votes ordered cast by the people for the office of President and: Vice
President of the republic. There was no pompous ritual, no trumpet" blasts, no military display.
While hearts may have felt the prayer "God save the republic," no voice had to cry "God save the
King. ;.'â¢â¢.: ,
So in all its varied tints and tones passes the procession of royalty, dead and living, mourn
ing and marrying and giving in marriage, while the people, feeling themselves far from much of
it, express pleasure or displeasure- according as they feel disinheritance in their own land and have
no voice in its affairs. . Â« â
Almost concurrently another scene is on the stage that concerns the government of man and
perhaps the welfare of the world in a sense that may not be ascribed to the others. *
THE world sits as an audience to (great events which affect the 1 welfare of nations and peoples.
With solemn pomp the English/; Queen and Empress' has been entombed, and with medieval
pageantry her son and successor has been proclaimed. His Parliament has been opened with
elaborate ceremony, and he will take the great oaths of coronation that guarantee the civil and re
ligious freedom of his people. . . â¢â¢ .' ?' â¢
Just across that channel that was once^ swept ..by ;Van.Tromp's broom the Queen of Holland
has taken a noble to husband, and her people, on whom government rests lightly, have .cele
brated with her in all the good feeling of one family and with a simplicity of heart that makes one
forget the royal pomp and circumstance of an occasion of such significance to the young woman
and to her country and dynasty. ;.' . * Â£;~ '
In the land of Holland's old' oppressor passes a different wedding scene, uniting two ancient
houses. But while the Spanish Princess signs her wedding settlement her country rocks and
sways in the first tempest' of revolution. I Mobs howl at the palace gates, and%make the great

varied with such amazing: ' compass of

almost insupportable. The storm of rage,
jealousy and despair lit up the fourth act

graveside.
Two hundred carriages followed the cof

AN EXTRAORDINARY SCENE
AT DESCHANEL'S WEDDING
political personages, former diplomats and
literary notabilities, were present.
There was an extraordinary scene out
e?de the church at noon, the hour fixed for
the ceremony. Thousands of invitations
had been issued and the church was not
large enough to accommodate all, so the
latest arrivals, including the principal
witnesses and all the leading guests,
found themselves In the midst of a strugl
gling throng of Paris notabilities, elbow-
Ing one another in an endeavor to obtain
an entranpe. <
M. Deschanel. his bride and their
parents were kept waiting at the church
door for ten minutes before the police
could force a' passage through the crowd
General Horace Porter, the United
States Embassador; General Andre the
Minister of War: M. Victorien Sardou M
Meline and Countess and Count Boni do
Casteilane arrived almost together Gen
eral Porter waved his Invitation and
begged to be allowed to pass. The only
response was the waving of a thousand
other cards and the general shout. "We
have cards, too." So General Porter and
other personages, including all the Cabi
net Ministers, except the Premier. M
Waldeck-Rousseau. who had not yet ar- #
rived, and their wives had to wait outside
until the Prefect of Police. M. Lepine
conducted them to a side door. '
The throng.lriside thn church absolutely
lacked decorum and had to be prevented
from seizing the front seats reserved for
President Loubet and the chief lady
guests. The spectators hustled one an
other in their efforts to secure tho best
view points and some of those present
even climbed into the pulpit i"Â«sÂ«ni

GREAT DIFFICULTIES
Â«OF SPAINJS GOVERNMENT
Since then Orange Ulster has been al
most unanimous in supporting Mr. Rus
fell in public meetings, and this probably
led to the adoption of the plank in the
'Government platform which the King's
speech really means. Another question
en which all Irish parties are, united is
the financial relation of the two countries.
According to the act of .union Ireland is
supposed to contribute a share of the im
perial taxes proportionate to her popu
lation, but- for years this has been ex
ceeded by an average of $12,500,000 a year.
When the question Â¦ comes up at this
session there is likely to be. a hot de
bate,** a "fetrong party both in" the Lords
and Commons demanding redress. â¢
' It is already officially known that the
King. Is going, to aee his sister at Cron
berg and he more than expects that he
may be summoned at any moment, while
the Queen, on the other hand, may simul
taneously go to Denmark, where her aged
luther is in failing health.
It is a very delicate matter to touch
upon and the papers have not at present
said a word upon the subject, but in well
informed circles of those around the
King it is well known that his Majesty's
state of health is anything but what it
might be.
According to a rumor which has ema
nated from a well-known friend of the
King his Majesty is suffering from a
very serious Internal complaint, which is
of a nature similar to that to which the
Duke of Kdinburgh recently succumbed
and from .which Empress Frederick is
suffering.
The great question which crops up here
at the present^ moment and which is ex
citing politicians much is the evident ap
peal for money made by the King in his
speech at the opening of Parliament.
The people have all kinds of Ideas as
to what the debts of the King amount to.
Some people say they are as high as
JI5.000.000, which would be equal to those
of George III. Parliament having paid for
him $16,900.00(1 .
. LONDON. Feb. 16.â The prominence
given to .Irish legislation in the King's
speech- is regarded as another instance
>of the policy of the present Government
to kill home rule with kindness. The de
mand for the compulsory .sale .of. tenant
farms has been the* subject of a bitter
controversy, resulting in the severance
of T. W. Russell, former member of
the Salisbury Government, from the Alln
iatry and his adherence to the National
ist party.

JOHN E. REDMOND, LEADER
OF THE3 UNITED IRISH
PARTY.
A painting supposed to be ; a genuine
Raphael of 1510 will be sold ai auction
here February 23. It is claimed that the
late Professqr Nicole discovered the paint
ing at Ijau-jsane. and that William K.
Vanderbilt offered. $800,000 for it.
The Berliner Neueste Nachrichten, Con
servative, has printed an article making
a strong argument that Germany has no
need to fear a tariff war with the United
States, oven if large agricultural duties
are Imposed, because American imports
here are two and a half times those of
Germany to the United Statps. It cites a
dispatch saying the Treasury Department
at Washington is overwhelmed with tele
grams on the subject of additional "sugar
duty, adding: "This shows that Ameri
can business interest is opposed to a pos
sible tariff war with Russia. How much
more, will \t oppose a tariff war with Ger
many."
The array of facts presented by Herr
Bebel, the Socialist leader, proving that
Bishop Anzer has been frequentfy inter
meddling In Chinese internal affairs, not
only In Shantung but outside the prov
ince, has been left undisproved in the
Reichstag.
Mass meetings called Dy 'the. Socialists
throughout Germany this .week passed
strongly worded resolutions against pro
posed prohibitive agricultural duties,
branding them as a most unjust and most
onerous burden for the working party of
the nation and dictated solely by the "bru
tal class of the empire and the lowest
Agrarian selfishness." They not only pro
test against increased duties but demand
their entire abolition.
The Dresdener Nachrichten. Conserv
ative, says: "Stnce Prince Bismarck's
fall the relations between the nation and
the Emneror were never worse."
The semi-official press since his Majes
ty's return has been doing everything to
counteract this all-pervading anti-Em-'
peror sentiment, but rather unsuccessful
ly. It is noteworthy that the strongest
opposition to Emperor William in this
connection comes from the â¢ Conserv
atives, which party usually claims loyal
ty to the monarchy as a monopoly. ; Â¦
The Munich AUgemeine Zeltung (Na
tional Liberal), inspired, announces that
Count von Bulow, Imperial Chancellory
assumes responsibility for Emperor Â¦ Wil
liam's pro-British acts and that he will
seize on an early opportunity to show the
nation that his Majesty has good and
sufficient- reasons for his conduct
The Vorwaerts (the leading Socialist
organ) sarcastically points out that- the
"younger party expresses disapproval of
Emperor William's doinga even more
freely than the Socialists whenever his
Majesty happens to differ with them."
The winter trip which ' General Werder
Is to undertake to Russia has been mis
interpreted. General Werder is not un
dertaking any diplomatic mission as re
ported. He simply goes to Russia as the
private guest of several old Russian
friends at St. Petersburg. However, It is
not officially denied that Russia, includ
ing the Czar himself, is deeply suspicious
of Emperor William's doings In Great
Britain, notwithstanding the fact that
the Russian Embassador here. Count
Saken. during several conferences with
Count von Bulow, was assured that his
Majestv's actions were simply due to his
impulsive nature and strong family feel
ing. -Â¦ .. . . Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦
There is no doubt that the German na
tion is heartily tired of the China war.
This is shown, not only. by the attitude- of
the pr*sÂ» but by the utterances In the
Reichstag and PrusPlan Diet. It. Is true
the China expenses for 1909. amounting to
153.000.000 marks, were finally voted, but
the opposing Socialist speeches were
heard by the Conservatives and Centrists
almost without reply, except In connec
tion with the missions. Baron Riehtho
fen, Secretary bf 4 Foreign Affairs, re
marked on this subject that the necessity
of affording higher and more effective
protection to the China- missionaries had
been impressed upon Dr. Miinim von
Sehwarzensteln, the German Minister at
Peking, as a point to be raised in the final
peace negotiations.
The Tageblatt ironically says: "The
harmony between England and Germany
la evidently largely overestimated, be
cause Mr. Bowles' queries were dictated
by nothing but ill will and spite."
The Lokal Anzeiger says: "'Hardly has
Parliament opened when the accustomed
spiteful anti-German hatred begins." Â¦Â¦-
The Emperor's pro-British sentiments
and actions are still unceasingly con
demned. â¢ , â¢ . ,
BERLIN. Feb. 16.â Emperor WillianVs
friendly conduct toward - Great Britain
recently and the motives which induced
it still form the favorite subject for dis
cussion here. Because of this unusual,in
terest was taken In Germany, in the
opening of the British Parliament. The
speech from the throne and the debate on
the address in reply to it were'thorough
ly disappointing: because of the absence
of any reference to closer relations.

that a.bout December 2 hls\ wife com

against him, which -Increased in severity
until January 1, when he left. He says
that his wife refused to work, and that
she said she would not soil . her : hands

She acpused him of 'being'" igornant and

sessment work, there -would be rome re-'
sultant good to the real miner. The sug
gested amendments have long been advo
cated by legitimate mining Interests.
The bill introduced by Senator Stewart
proposing changes in the United States
mining laws and resulting criticism
called out the foregoing.
The Secretary of the- Interior haa
reversed a recent ruling of the Gen
eral Land Commissioner concerning
locations of claims across claims
previously patented. The latter had
refused patent to a Gilpln County,
Colo., company on the ground that some
of its location lines were laid within or
upon other patented lode claims. The Sec
retary holds that extralateral rights are
often the most, valuable rights obtained
in a lode location, and that exterior lines
of a location are not, in themselves, prop
erty, but are mere boundaries or Instru
ments of description, and that the Junior
locator has the right, when necessary, to
place end lines on other patented claims.
John Hays Hammond. Jeff Doolittle and
others have bonded 2000 acres of land nine
miles east of Marysvllle on a continuation
of the old Smartsville channel and will
there dredge for gold.
The Marysvllle Democrat says: -
There afe many places' In the upper half of
Tuba County where gold can be had In paying
quantities by the expenditure of a small
amount of money. Thl* has been demonstrated
on many occasions In the past, particularly In
New York and Northeast townships. ThrÂ«e
years ago the editor of the Democrat was in
the vicinity of Strawberry Valley, and went
to a spot of ground on the side of a ravine
where a young man dug out a little more than
H00 In nuggets, ranging from U and }2 to $28
each. The surface worked over was not larger
than an ordinary miner's cabin, where later
he found more gold. Near where' L,. W. Clark
found a pocket of gold last Sunday at Racker
by there have been several notable and val
uable finds of the same class or similar. This
writer saw about $9000 In eold that was taken
â¢ut of a pocket of decomposed rock near Han
sonville. .some of It being in sheets not thicker
than window glass, where it was found In the
seams free of Quartz. This discovery 1 was by
R. M. Johnson, an old and respected citizen,
who still resides near Rackcrby. â¢ .
A deed has been placed on record
In the County Recorder's . office in
Tuolumne County in which tho Tu
olumnÂ© ' Consolidated Mining Com
pany transfers to the Providence
Consolidated Gold Mining Company,
for a consideration of $50,000, a long list
of mines in' east belt, about two miles
from Carters. Â¦ E. A. Wiltsee. the presi
dent of the Tuolumne Consolidated Min
ing Company, is named as one of the
stocholders, possessing 4600 shares, while
Alexander Granger figurÂ«s as the secre
tary.
Following are the properties disposed of:
Consuelo, Bullion, Good Enough, Polar
Star, Fair Play, Southern Cross, After
Thought, Providence, Belcher (sometimes
known as the Lucy), mining claims; Inde
pendent, located as a tunnel site; also a
right-of-way over the Spring Hill, Bunker
Hill and Independent mines, and a privi
lege for a pipe line, ditches and dumping
ground on the Blue Jay mine; together
with all other property, water rights and
privileges.
Eastern mining Journals believe that the
transfer of the controlling Interest in the
Southern Pacific Company to the Union
Pacific will, result in good to the coast
miners. This idea is based on the past
policy of the Union Pacific There are
certainly many grievances of which the
miners of California have complained
when dealing with the Southern Pacific
Company. Claims have been abandoned
because the owners thereof could not af
ford to pay the freights Imposed upon
them. This is an old story to Califor
nians, but may be new enough to the Un
ion Pacific management to carry to It a
hint that the conditions of the past can
be greatly improved and to the advan
tage of both the mining interest and the
transportation lines. For Instance, the
Engineering and Mining Journal, pub
lished in New York, talcing a long dis
tance view of the miners under the new
regime, says:
The Union Paclflo ' people have usually
shown a disposition to encourage the Interest!
tributary to their road. It is to bÂ« hoped
that the narrow policy of looking only to im
mediate profit and exacting the highest pos
sible ratesâ which the Southern Pacific Com
pany has persistently followed under the Hunt
lngton managementâ will be abandoned for ft
more liberal and far-sighted plan.
In this wish there will be no exceptions
among the miners of the Pacific Coast:
On all sides the opinion is held that the
year 1901 ought to be exceptional in a min
ing way in California, There will be wat
er enough in all sections. The drouth In
Southern California, which has lasted
some years, has been effectually broken
during the present winter. The miners
of the south are as happy over the out
look as are those in the northern tier of
counties. It is true that there is ao much
snow in certain places that mining has
come to a temporary standstill, but the
promise of the future is so good that there
is no tendency to grumble. It has been
really snowing $20 pieces* In the high
mountains the snowfall hajs been very
heavy and as the weather has been cold
there are excellent chances that the snow
will pack finely and will not melt until
summer, which is the ideal condition.
The heavier the snow, ao the interior pa
pers are truthfully remarking, the longer
the mills will be able to run. "Every
thing," says the Stockton Independent, "Is
humming in mining circles."- This is the
general idea all along the line.
The figures of the United States Bureau
of Statistics reveal some striking facts
concerning the value of the mining Indus
try of this country to tne world at large.
Twenty-eight per cent of the total domes
tic exports of the United States last year
originated beneath the surface of the
earth In mines, or more than one-quarter
of the entire volume.
The Mohave Miner is reasoning that the
copper belt of Arizona covers the entire
territory from the northern border to the
Gulf of California. The evidence that is
adduced to support this glittering theory
is as follows:
On the north side of the Colorado River are
several of the greatest copper mines in tha
Â¦West, and. following this are the United Verde
and Globe mines, and on the International
border are the Ajo mines. To the west of the
general trend of the copper belt are the mines
of the Bill Williams fork, which are proving
to be good deposits. The Miner predicts that
Arizona is destined to become the greatest
copper-producing: territory on earth.
In the Superior Court in Shasta County
a decision was . recently rendered by
Judge Sweeney which involved the own
ership of placer property located by the
defendants, upon which the plaintiffs sub
sequently riled a quartz location, claim
ing that discovery had been made of a
vein or lode of sufficient extent and value
to make the ground valuable for quartz
mining purposes. Suit was brougnt to
establish the title of the plaintiffs' con
tention as against the validity of the
placer location. The Judge held in favor
of the defendants, laying it down that,
although a vein did exist, development
work had been insufficient to warrant
any reasonable person in working it for
a profit as a quart* proposition. The
placer location was, therefore, confirmed.
The case had been in the court two years.
C. W. Riest of Red Bluff believes that
he has discovered the secret of saving
fine gold. A machine that be has Invent
ed will do the work, he says. He will
try some experiments on tho river north
of Red Bluff, using a steam engine for
motive power.
A correspondent of the Amador Ledger,
who signs himself "A Practical Miner,
suggests that the mines which have been
considered to be west of the mother lode,
the Peerless and the Klrkwood, may be
on the real mother lode. His reasoning
is attracting some notice) in tho papers
published in the mining counties. His
communication is as follows:
This section of country between the Jackson
Creek end the Mokelumr.e River, although in
nearly a direct line between two great gold
producers, remalnR, with the exception of a
few tunnels and prospect holes, almost virgin
ground. â¢
The formation of the ground through which
they have been Kinking, strengthened by the
fact that thrse mines are situated in a natural
openlnc between eaid producers, is certainly
evidence that they might be In the right chan
nel. Ami again, for. (he Gwln ledge to paus
east of this belt it would have to turn easterly
and cut across a section of hard country rock.
It 1r not probable that a. vein with a gouge
would do this. The natural way would be
for it to run parallel with the hard rock; then
If such was the case the Gwln lode would run
up Hlaclc Gulch and through to the Kennedy.
Should those interested in these properties
poeseKft the necessary pluck characteristic of
all thorough prospecting, they will undoubtedly
demonstrate that their judgment has not been
far from right. As to the Peerless and Klrk
wood there /can be no doubt that they are
both on the fame belt' because there is only
one slate running through this locality. Pos
sibly they are on different sides of . it, still
even though they were they would' get their
mineral from the fame source, Â¦ thereby making
them practically the same thing.
"If bills were -passed," 'says the Scien
tific and Mining Press, *'by the United
States Congress repealing the 'apex* and
'extralateral' features of mining locations
making their limits' vertical side and end
lines, making all locations conform to le
fyil subdivisions of United States surveys,

of improvements and make application for
patent within flvo years from date of lo
cation and an amendment not allowing

Many Indications of Interest in Home
Product Are Manifest and
Exploitation Goes On
Actively. \ .
The California oil fields evidently have
the confidence of the people of this State
in preference to those ot any other local
ity, although there is a movement on
foot in which- Californians are concerned
for the exploitation of oil lands in Mexico.
There are also companies ana individuals
that may seek fortunes In the 1 oil oJ
Texas. These places are so far away
that the majority of California Investors
will -undoubtedly pin their hopes of real
izing gain to California. Every week,
just as It has been for a long period, navir
companies are organized to drill in Call-
fornla.
The general controversy between the
Bcrlppera and the placer locators of min
eral lands has had ono gopd effect. Soma
companies that had uncertain titles to
lands have dropped out of the arena, leav
ing the struggle for wealth to those thut
are, literally 6peaklne. eolidly. grounded.
There is more briskness in proceeding to
actual work on all sides. If there are aot
many fortunes added 10 those already de
rived from oil it will rot be the fault of
the army of men engaged In piercing tha
soil in Quest of oil <5a.ids.
It is possible, as suesested by the En
gineering and Mining Journal, that tho
discovery of the great Texas gusher at
Beaumont, in Jefferson County, will stim
ulate tne wide exploitation of the State of
Texas, especially in the counties of Or
ange. Chambers, liberty. Hardin. Tyler.
Jasper, Newton. Angelina, San Augustine.
Sabine and Nacogdocnes. Some oil has
also been found In Nacogdoches County.
The earliest operations in Texas were in
that county. As far back as 1868 thera
were oil discoveries there. Ten years ago
there was a pipe line connecting the wells
at Oil Springs with the railroad at Nacog
doches. Oil has also recently been found
in Starr County, near the Rio Grande
River, In the southern part of the State, Â«.
little west of the Corsicana tield. The
present operations in Texas are confined,
mottly, to the counties of Navarro tin
which is the Corsicana field), also to >a
co&doches. Jefferson, which includes Beau
mont and Sour Lake, and Bexar.
Some Interest will be manifested con
cerning the statistics of the oil output of
Texas, which are supplied by the ii.engi
neerine and Mining Journal. In 1SS3 tne
totai. output of Texas was only forty
eight barrels and the output never reached
lw bairels in any one year until 1Â»95, when
the total production was 1450 barrels. Then
came a big increase. The following year.
1S97, the output amounted to 65,975 barrels.
This was multiplied ninefold in 1S98. in
round figures the total being 54(5,070 bar
rels. In 1SS9 the total was 6b9,013 barrels,
in 19'V) the figures were 956,000 barrels. In
cluding the great gusher at Beaumont and
the Corsicana field, the total for 1901 may
be 4.OU0.WO barrels and possibly more.
Many Kastern persons who visited Beau
mont went home without investing there,
They assign as reasons that land had
been Jumped to $SOJ and $1000 per acre in
that vicinity and also that no lease could
be obtained without giving one-quarter
and one-third royalties.
Berkelev has a new oil company. The
holdings consist of 160 acres on the Flood
ranch in Contra Costa County, adjoining
the Miner ranch, where two wells are
drilling.
Oil is still reported to be going to waste
in the Sunset district because of the lack
of proper tankage. The stormy weather
and bad roads have prevented the deliv
ery of tanks that have been constructed.
The Los Angeles Stock Exchange is .on
dfavoring to have an exhibition of the
petroleum of the southern fields made at
the Pan-American Exhibition at Buffalo
Tweive new locations of oil claims were
filed at Red Bluff last Saturday. Some
of the locators are interested in all the
claims then filed.
A second company has been organized
to drill for oil near Chlco and has con
tracts for the purchase of 5000 acres of
land.
The St. Helena Star reports the lease
of 320 acres of land near Knoxvllle to
prospectors for oil. The terms are one
eiphth royalty, drilling to begin within
five months.
The Standard Oil Company is drilling
three wells and deepening another on the
property recently purchased from the Pa
cific Coast OH Company at Newhall.
Mendoclno County, so says the Ukiah
Dispatch-Democrat, has invested $50,000 in
oil within the past few months, "and
every man. woman and child who has any
loose change is ready to buy oil stocks."
Fakers went Into Glen Ellen and sold
something like $30,000 worth of oil stock
and then set a day when they would* be
gin operations. They failed to appear on
time and the people have concluded they
have been robbed through a confidence
game.
The committee to find a plan for the or
ganization of an oil exchange at Hanford
has reported and the exchange may be a
reality soon.
The figures of the business of the year

at I^os Angeles, are as follows: Shares
sold 3,17S.531 1 ,Â£; value of shares sold.

Because the Union Oil Company refused

struck its stock from its list and brokers

The rains have interfered with work in
Humboldt County and in several other lo
calities to which sprinc will brins re-

The Secretary of the Interior will hoar
the contest between the scrlppers and the
mineral locators of oil lands next month.
The Colusa Herald pays four new wells
â¢will be drilled In the western part of Co
lusa County, in the Sulphur Creek vicin
ity. Two wells are being drilled in the
Sand Creek country. A part of the ma
chinery for the four new wells is at "Wil
liams. .
A tract of 4S0 acres of land has been lo
cated for oil in Potter Valley by Surveyor
McMurty and other? of Sutter County.
Work in San DleKQ County, which was
suspended on account of the rain, is about
to be resumed. " -
J. T. Flynn of this city, who has been
recently in the Indiana Held, has tha fol
lowing to say of interest: "Indiana's
product has the same h<*at producing ca
pacity as the average California oil, but
it has to compete with coal worth a dol
lar a ton. which reduce? its fuel value to
2n cents per barrel, while the California
oil comes into competition with coal at
from $C to S10 per ton. For this reason
the production of a million barrels of oil
per day in Indiana or in Texas could not
affect the value of the California product.
If the producer* in Indiana and Texas
were to deliver their product absolutely
free for shipment the railroads could not
draw it to California for its gross fu,el
value."
Texas Is Not Competitor to
Supply California With
Fuel Oil.

THE Sonoma ef the Oceanic Steam
ship Company's mall line between
here and Australasia has estab
lished a r.ew record. She made the
run from here to Sydney, X. S.
"W.. in nineteen days fifteen hours, or one
day and a half ahead of her contract time
and the same ler.gih of time ahead of the
record set by the Mar!posa on her last
voyage. The time of buth vessels includes
el! Â£toj>s.
The Sonoma met with very heavy weath
er between bwe and Honolulu, neverthe
less the irip was made In five days four
teen hours. There was considerable delay
at the Hawaiian port and the mall boat
was behind time leaving port. She ran
like a "scared deer.* say the men on the
Sirrra between Honolulu and Pago Pago,
Basso*, and when Auckland. N. Z.. was
reached the mall was eighteen hours
hhead cf time.
The run from San Francisco to Apck
lar.d. including all etops. had been made
n sixteen days fifteen hours.
T^f- run from Auckland to Sydney hs.s
been always figured on as a three day3
twelve hours run, but the Sonoma did it
:r. â¢rrf-e days or less Knd arrived at her
ce=t;r.a:ion on the 15th Inst. thlny-slx
boon ahead of her contract time.
Ccnei'ierinfc all that had to bo contended
with and the fact that the Sonoma is
practically on her maiden voyage the rec
onl is a "remarkable o:ie. When she ar
rived here from Philadelphia new circu
lating pumps had to be put in and the
-machinery overhauled. Chief. Engineer A.
I). Liu!e and Assistant Chief Church
worked lik*Â» troorers and when the Sono
ma left hf-re she was in Eplendid ehape.
From h. re to Honolulu it is about 2100
Dalles, from Honolulu to Pago Pajro about
2270 dUm. from Papo Paeo to Auckland
about ISC9, and from Auckland to Syd
r.^y about !><> miles. Leaving out of ac
rnr:r.t the fact that the Sonoma was dc
talnr-d kbout twelve hours at Honolulu.
jhÂ«t it tr.r,ic her fix hours to enter and
clÂ«*ar at I'ag') Pag-o and that she- was
nrnhaHy twdv hours or more at Auck
land, the magnificent mall boat averaged
STO knots a flay. I^eavir.ff out her hours
of dÂ«t^r.tion and .^he must hava averaged
over CM km>i!- or a continuous epeed of
about Fixteon knots- an hour. F'or a
brand new ship it Is a record to be proud
of.

Bomeifmes children become willful and
refuse nourishing food, demanding sweets,
candy, icecrÂ«?am, much to their det-
riment. It is a help rn such. cases
to have a food that Is naturally sweet and
attractive.^ A case in Phlla. will Illustrate.
The daughter of Mrs. M. E. Searles,
living at 1330 Mlfflln St., was a delicate
child from infancy and had been indulged
lh, many things. She gradually got thin-
ner and more fretful daily, refusing food
other than sweets, etc., finally contracting
wijooplng cough, which undermined her
heaTtb to such an extent that her attend-
ing physicians agreed that her cough had
dei-eloped into bronchial catarrh, and that
enly a short time would ensue before con-
Fumption would relieve her sufferings.
tn despair the'chlld's aunt was sent for,
and knowing the wonderful nutritive
value of Grape-Nuts food, she prepared
come and Induced the little one to eat it.
At the first taste she eald: "Oh, auntie,
thin is bo nice; I want some more." From
that time the child acquired an appetite
and began to improve. She was fed on
Grape-Nuts steadily until now she Is a
perfectly, healthy, strong child, attends
the Girls' Grammar School and- is a
â¢rijfht and tst pupil. j

DISTRICT ATTOBNEY
FILES HIS REPORT
Makes Comparison Between Work of
This and -Preceding Years and
-Claims Improvement.
District Attorney Byington submitted a
report. yesterday to Mayor Phelan of the
workings of his office during the last
year, the first under the new charter,
with comparisons as to former years un>
der the old system.
He says that the change In having all
prosecutions, both In the Superior and the
Police courts, together with the drawing
of all complaints and warrants, confided
to his office I has resulted not alone In a
more efficient' administration of Justice,
but In a marked financial saving to the
city and a correction' of several Â¦ abuses
which had grown 'no in the municipal
government, j There was a yearly saving
in conducting. the office of $4600, besides a
further saving, of $2100 per year, formerly
paid â¢ an expert for examining bonds. In
addition the office now not only performs
all the duties which, under the consolida
tion act, were performed by departments
costing' the city $6900 per annum more,
but In addition thereto V receives cash
bail and approves all* ball' bonds taken In
the Police courts and J renders other ser
vices not formerly imposed upon it.
During the year the sum of $232,763 in
cash bail has been received and acounted
for to the Treasurer â¢ and Auditor, ac
cording to the report. In addition 665 ball
bonds, aggregating $320,220, had been re
ceived and examined by. the warrant and
bond clerk. In no- instance had any.ball
bond been declared forfeited . which had
not been collected".. No such thing as an
uncollectable or "straw", bond had been
heard of during the year: The release of
prisoners on "ORs" had also been (en
tirely checked. Â¦ .. ; . , ..
The 1 comparison of records, of the de
partment for many years back shows that
crime in this city was less last year than
ever before, while the percentage of per
sons held to answer before the Superior
Court on- felony charges was much
greater and the administration of justice
speedier than at any other time.
He Tells'Some Inside Facts About
A TALK WITH 'MUNYON.
His Witch Hazel Soap.
It was once said.â and not long ago. eitherâ
that a new soap is placed upon the market,
every day. Kach in accorded a brief spasm ol
publicity. A peculiar' name Is probably made
popular for a few weeks and then nothing: is
ever heard of it again. "Yes." said Professor
Munyon the other day In converratlon with a
newspaper writer, "I met with considerable ob
jections when I Informed by friends and the
drug trade In general that I was about to place
a new scap in the field. I was told that the
public was never so fickle In supporting any
article as that of a soap: that one brand was
never used for any length of ' time and that
folks were always looking for novelties in this
special direction. Thii was probably one of
the reasons why there are so many soaps, but
I felt' that there was another catiifefor all this
and that was that the public had novel 1 yet
been given the roap they wanted, one that
satisfied them In every respect. 1 proposed tc
give It to them." And here the professor grew
quite earnest in his remarks. "I told these
critics that I had a soap whose basis Is -Witch
Hazel-real Witch Hazel-not .Witch Hazel in
name only, not watery Witch Hazel, but a
scientifically concentrated Witch Hazel. , I had
a Witch Hazel that had the solidity "of Jelly.
I knewUhat Witch Hazel had proved itself one
cf the best curatives yet known to Medical
Science.. But not only this, , I nad- combined
this Witch Hazel -with other- medicaments
known as skin beautiflers and emollients. Then
my friends told me, 'But that must make your
soap very expensive.' That was true. .It is ex
pensive. The- soap that I ani now putting on the
market probably costs double that of any otller
toilet soap, but I knew that I could only please
the public and hold its support by giving them
a soap that was superior to anything yet offered
them. I am willing to stake my reputation and
fortune on the _ success of Munyon' s Wltcn
Hazel Soap. In it the people -have a soap that
will soften the roughest hands, that will keep
the pores in a healthy condition,' that is abso
lutely free from all rancid fats 'and dangerous
alkalies. It is .best for- the complexion, best
for the L-calp, best for. curing all skin eruptions
and 'Will; positively cure dandruff and allay all
forms of itchine. Mothers will find it the best
eoap baby ever had. Every Ingredient In this
eoa/ is pure enough to eat: in fact my chemist
has said ;tt Is good enough to fry oysters Jn.
Now this soap Is not being placed on the mar
ket as an experiment. I have made my experi
ments for several years past. I have had the
best thought in: this country engaged In mak
ing this soap, and -It was not put -out until I
had achieved what I considered the perfection
of soap making. I leave It to the public wheth
er I have succeeded or, not. I am sure I i have."
The extended stay of President Hays
In New York creates a deep feeilng of
uncertainty among the prominent officials
of the Southern Paclflp in this city. Many
of them do not, judging. Irom their actions
and expressions, think that their positions
are by any means assured. <N
A prominent official of the company said
yesterday that the Harriman syndicate,
deal suggests economy, and that one of
the first moves along that line would be
that as many as possible of the general
officers who are now holding-high posi
tions at. the head of the operating depart
ments or freight departments will become
assistants In similar departments, and
that the present assistants will drop to
chief clerks, and so on down the list. \
Many clerks maybe" dropped'altogeth
er, but the principal sufferers will be the
minor officials, who will have to go to
make rooiji for the men ahead of 'them
who are dropped down aJpeg. Agents and
general agents at -different points, it is
claimed, will be affected for the same
ieason. ' ' . ' â¢ Â¦ t :.
The fact Is brought out tha\ the higher
local railroad officials In this city are not
viewing with any great amount of jollity
the consolidation steps that are being ta
ken, and they are very anxious, to hear
when President Hays will return. â¢
. Harriman and- the financiers that -are
his associates are not hampered with too
much sentiment, so claim the local rail
road men -who have been studying "the
dope." They admit that the conference
of Hays with the Harriman syndicate was
made or was prolonged In laying, plans
.to stop all waste and' extravagances at
all points possible. For- that reason the
railroad men argue that while one set
of officers may not handle the business of
the Northwestern,' Union and Southern
Pacific railroads, they are prepared for
the -worst. / . v
This consolidation of offices. If It should
be effected/would mean a saving of thou
sands of dollars to the stockholders
monthly and consequently bigger divi
dends.

The Secretary of the Treasury, to whom
inquiries addressed to President McKin

statement to the people of California
through the Congressional delegation ana
the Governor that an independent and
unprejudiced Investigation had .been or
dered, yet the University of California,
the State Board of Health and local phy
sicians of national eminence are not In
vited'to assist, although Dr. Kinyoun's
supporter. Dr. Kellogg. Is consulted at
f-very step. The, special commissioners
are apparently blameless, because they
have written- instructions, to confer with
the local authorities. More than that. It
appears that their report will' not be
made public until it Is approved by the
surgeon genfral. . ' . ,
From all the facts attainable the state
ment, may be made that the commission
ers according to their own admission
have not found a. single case -of plague,
'although they have been at work for
three, weeks. The official record j*-as pre
rfnted to them yesterday, showing that

PROLONGED CONFERENCE
WITH GOVERNOR GAGE
Health Affairs Are Discussed at Length by
the Special Federal Commission.
the party who authorized me to sell the
land," said Allen, when questioned about
the matter. "I was as badly deceived as
any one else. I was led to believe that
the sale would take place in New York
City, and that the Administrator. "needed
money to clear off debts on the estate.
I was assured that the deed to' the prop
erty would be ready after next Tuesday."
"Were you acting for Bohls, who claims
title to the land through the sale made
by ex-Public Administrator Drinkhouse?"
was asked.
"Were you representing Bacigalupi, who
bought through the Italian Consul?"
"I was not," replied Allen.
"Who authorized you to sell the land?'"
was next asked.
â¢'I am not at liberty to state," replied
Allen. "I cannot divulge the name of my
client," he concluded.
The peculiar feature of the affair Is that
Allen told his cub-agents that the deed
would be clear after Tuesday next. The
petition of Bacigalupi for distribution of
the estate to nlm comes up. for hearing
next Tuesday and the hearing of the mo
tion for confirmation of the sale made
by ex-Public Administrator Drinkhouse to
Bohls was originally set for the same
time. It looks very much as if Allen's
client was either Bacigalupi or Bohls, not
withstanding his denial. ...
Charles G. Lamberson of Visalia, who
originally appeared in the role of counsel
for Theodore Baclgalupi, who acquired
title to the lan-i through the Italian Con
sul, has a deeper Interest than that of at
torney. When the deed from Consul Serra
was placed on record In Kern County It
was accompanied by another deed exe
cuted by Bacigalupi distributing the prop
erty. Bacigalupi. while posing as the
buyer, now holds but a one-sixth Interest
in the land. Edward Canale. a relative
of Bacigalupl. has a one-sixth Interest and
the remaining ! two-thirds are owned by
Attorney Lamberson and ML S. Wagy,
who filed a complaint In intervention when
S. N. Griffith and W. H. McKenzle
brought suit against ex-Public Adminis
trator Drinkhouse to quiet title to the
land patented by the United States to
Cuoco. It is said that Wagy and Lamber
son were the money producers when the
estate was sold by the Italian Consul and
that Bacigalupi was only used as a figure
head.
Lamberson has engaged tlje services of
Attorneys Freeman and Bates to assist
him in making the fight to have Judge
Troutt, on Tuesday next, distribute the
Cuoco estate. to BacigalupL
"We are In the fiffht to stay," said
Lamberson yesterday, "%nd we do not
care who contests our rights to the land.
We bought it from the Italian Consul, who
holds the power of attorney from the heirs
and our title cannot be disturbed. All this
fuss and talk has been raised by a few
disappointed people who expected that the
plum was going to fall Into their laps. It
fell our way -and now they are not only
objecting, but resorting to methods that
savor of blackmail. We originally bought
the land for $S00 and thought that would
be the end of the matter. A few days
later a delegation of Italians called on u.-i
and demanded a one-fÂ«brth share In the
property. They said that unless we took
them In they would raise a row and make
it unpleasant for the Consul. They said
that they had informed the. secretary of
the Consul that thev would bid $1500 for
the land. Because we got It for $800 they
charged collusion. I :oid them that I was
willing to do what was right by them if
they would give me a sufficient guarantee
that another batch of them would not ap
pear later and demand a share. They
could not give me such guarantee and I
dropped all negotiations with them. A few
days later J heard from Consul Scr.ra. Hit
was angry and eaid that when he sold the
land for $S00 he had no' knowledge of a
higher off.er having been made to his sec
retary. I always favor peaceful measures
and not wanting to have the Consul un
necessarily' worried and bothered I told
him that when we received a clear deed
and title to the land I would pay him $SW
more. That would make the price $100
higher than, that offered "by the kickers."
"How much have you paid up to the
present time?" was asked.
"We haven't got the title clear yet," re
plied Lemberson, "so the other T800 con
tingent on peace and quiet" has not j been
paid. I don't know where It Is going to
end. I undertand that' there are some
claimants who now allege that they told
Secretary Scodellettl that they were wi!l
ing to bid as high as $3000 for the land.
I guess that they are only dreaming."
The papers attacking the validity of the
sale to Bacipalupl by Consul Serra aÂ»-e
being prepared. The court will - be asked
to set aside the deed on the ground that
It was procured from the Consul by fraud
Attorney T. J. Lyons, who represents the'
Consulate, says that he has ample proof
to show that the Consul wes deceived by

the point of buying eighty ax-res of the
so-called "desert land" In Kern County

gratulating himself on his narrow escape
from being swindled. Bacigalupi and his
attorneys pay that they never heard of
the proposed sale to Finch, and Henry
Bohls, who also lays claim to the land by
virtue of purchase from ox-Public Ad
ministrator Drinkhouse, denies all knowl
edge of the transaction. The land was
offered for pale by F. R. Allen of the firm
of Mosteller & Allen, En the Parrott build
ing. Allen refuses to give the name of
his clients, but says that he was deceived.
He did not attempt to sell the land him
self, but commissioned another firm en

chaser. The purchaser was found, but be
fore Finch parted with his money the
exposure came. â¢

would be heard from the stand for The

on the stretch, the latter finishing- ahead
of the show winner by three lengths. A
straggling line of horses, ThÂ© Lady lead-
Ing the non-winners, came In with de
jected heads and sour looks. .
There was nothing exciting to the race,
on account of the "Waring dominance.
Shout upon shout arose from the "stand

Hildreth smiled as he thought of hi3 an
nouncement, on the previous day that If
the -weather were fine he would not start
"Waring. The weather may not have been
what is usually called fine, but the track
was dry and fast, and McCueâ this was
his first ride in California this season
showed just how fast Waring could be
made to go.'
It was a genuine - holiday crowd that
flocked to Tanforan yesterday, and the
bookies were kept busy taking the mon*y
right away from it without the turn of h.
lash. -The whole thing came so easy. thÂ»
bookies really couldn't help it. Out of the
six races' but one favorite passed the wfra
for first money, and that" was unbeatable
Wyoming, who was twisted around at the
post when the start was made. But the
race .was a long- one.- and by sheer cour
age, grit and strength "Wyoming-, with;
O'Connor ud, passed under the wire â¢ a
bare neck ahead oÂ£ Owensboro.
The long-shot feast began with the first
dish- served by Ada N at S to 1. Grafter
was an odds on favorite, but there was
no real work done in the seven furlongs
event, and even Seide Â¦-. passed the * evil
named for the place. -Â»Burns rode a poor
waiting race on Grafter. â¢ Â¦'
- In the second race Pupil. With Henry up.
beat out Bucnanan 'on St. Cuthbert and
Tommy Burns on Prejudice. Pupil sold
at 12 to 1
â¢ The- 'steeplechase was one- of the best
ever given at Tanforan. Credo and L<v
thian took the last Jump together and the
race would have been a pretty onÂ© had
not Lothian stumbled, throwing Suther
land and leaving Credo an easy winner.
At the first jump Pallucus fell,- throwing
McMahon. his rider, but this meant noth
ing- to the horse, who got on his feet and
finished the full course along with Credo.
- The last race, ono mile, for three year
olds and up. was three-cornered with
Morvtanlc a 1 to 3 favorite. Florizar. the
winner, sold as high as 20 to 1. Buchanan,
clad In stars and. stripes, dropped far be
hind 1 Janice and Montanlc. who fought
their strength to tatters on â¢ the back
stretch.' so that when the 'finish came the
stars and stripes won th* day. Burns
claimed a foul, ,a bump by. Florixar In the
stretch, but It was not allowed. Thus the
day wound up -with another long shot In
the foreground.
Leads Sixteen | High Glass Starters in the San Francisco
Handicap for Ten Thousand Dollars.
The committee appointed Friday after
noon at a meeting- of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners and representative
members of the commercial-bodies of San
Francisco to further the cause of the con
struction of the seawall at China Basin
by the San \ Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway Company, met yesterday
in executive session.
A State law, passed March 26, 1895. and
amended in February, 1900, empowered the
Board of Harbor Commissioners to lease
certain lands of the State to any railroad
corporation not then having . terminal
facilities In the city, and county of San
Fraricsico. To the board was also gram
ed the power to authorize the construction
of seawalls and other improvements by
the lessees. ....
The railway company mentioned pro
posed to the Harbor Commissioners to
build a seawall along the bay 'side of its
premises. .The proposition was accepted
and the lease entered Into November 21
1900.: . , ' .
At the meeting yesterday H.D. Love
land "presented a resolution which the
State. Board of Â¦ Harbor Commissioners
wished to have adopted and which could
be taken by a committee to the Legisla
ture. Chairman Newhall immediately ap
pointed the following committee: Isaac
Upham, Wakefleld' Baker. F. W.' Van
Sicklen, Robert H. Swayne, J. R. Howell
and Horace- Davis. The committee at
once passed 'the resolution, which was to
the effect that the construction of .the sea
wall was of paramount importance to the
commercial interests j of the city and
State. .. : - ': â¢ Â¦ Â¦
A legislative committee "will be here to
day and the*above-named gentlemen will
accompany them - : on- -a'* visit tÂ«-. China
Basin. The resolution --was signed by. the
following named: George A. Newhall, A;
Sbabaro, A. Chesebrough, Louis F. ; Mont

Â¦blamed for supposed mis

track, the more critically in- .
dined censured Bullman for
* being overanxious and mak
ing his move too soon zvith
Favonius. Taking the other Â¦
side of it, Bullman, who has '
ridden Favonius in previous
H races, says the horse's feet
must have begun to burn, for
he drcclopcd an inclination
Â¦ to. stop. The pace set was by
no means a killing one, and
possibly the rider's theory is
a correct one. After all, The
Frcitcr may have been very
lucky, for had Joe Riplcy,
which in his day zvas con
sidered a high-class horse, â¢
been piloted by a stronger
and more experienced rider
the vwiiey . would have all
been his.

lights and advantages "of California.
Thousands and tens of thousand of East
ern visitors' are certain to come here
wJthin the next few months and thou-.
sands will remain In'the State. There are
many of the visitors who possess means.
There will be a stir in country lands for
a few months, unless all signs are dis
appointing and the newcomers from- the
East bid fair to be a factor in that move
ment. If they like. the country they will
build homes. ; Suburban San Francesco,
will benefit as largely as any section. The
thousands of visitors help- to call : atten-;.
tion to the fact that the hotels and lodg
ing-houses are counting upon a great
demand upon them for accommodations.
This pressure' .Â¦ has* been felt for some
time. People are building â¢' flats in all
eligible Idealities to make room for the
growing population. Eastern hotel men
are in. the city and are carrying on nego
tiations, which' are considered confidential

Owing to the many events already ar
ranged on the links at the Presidio be
tween Oakland and San Francisco, the
second half of tha home-and-home tour
nament will not bÂ« played until March 23

posted a notice at the San Francisco Golf
Club house requesting: as many players
as can do so to go <lown to Del Monto

the tournaments there, as successful as
possible. The Qualifying â¢ round . over
eighteen holes, stroke play, for the coun
cil's cup for men has been postponed from
February 23 to March 2. and the match

of that situation great.
The site -for the school fs on the famous

charming one. Forty acres of land has

T|-^y IVERSIPE, Feb. 10.â To those who
I )j are lnterested in the "welfare of
f\X - the MlsElon Indians- of; Southern
JI N A. California, the -establishment of
the new Indian -school "at'River
side is a subject 'for congratulation. All
thoughtful persons- recognize ' fully the
duty of the Government ,to protect and
pro\-lde for the* Mlsslon'Indians of South
1 ern California and to educate the Indian
children of both sexes to enable them to
become useful citizens and. honorable and
self-supporting members, .of the com-
celve Government support, t>ut that the
Government should do for these Indians
what its duty and their needs- demand
under the direct charge and control of the
Government Itself. The Indian School at
Perrls has been for some time over
crowded and can receive only a small pro
portion of the Indian boys and gjrls who
are of school age and who ought to be
provided for in Southern California. This
fact has' been recognized by Superintend
ent Harwood Hall.
Recognizing the need of greater accom-
modatlons for "these youner ; Indians, . of
ficials of that department- of the Govern
ment visited California and Inspected. the
Indian School at Perils with -a* view to its
enlargement and to broadening its field of
usefulness. It W a s recommended by these
officials that tnat school be not enlarged
or increased in"- capacity, but that a new
school be established at a more favorable
location. A thorough examination -. of
proposed sites was made under the direc
tion of Assistant Indian Commissioner A.

On account of the pudden death of his
lather Right Fielder Lelande of the visit
ing team could not come, and H. Myers,
a local player, was put into his position.
Though Myers is credited with making
two of the three runs made by the Los
Angeles team he was also charged with
two errors which were costly. Adams,
catcher for the visitors, played in excel
lent form, but twice dropped, the ball at
the plate, allowing runners to score. The
same teams will play to-morrow with
Babbitt in the box for the visitors and

STANFORD. "
FIREMAN'S FUND.
A mere hnndful of spectators watched
teams from the Fireman's Fund and the
Stanford University cavort on the dia
mond in Recreation Park yesterday
a.t ternoon. They saw the infurance apgre
pation take the- cardinal representatives
Into camp by" a score of 12 to 1. The game
was slew and uninteresting and
practically developed into' .a frae
Â»Ilver ball game â at- -a.- âratio- -of
nearly 16 -to 1. It was apparent
from the outset that Stanford could not
Â¦win from the Fireman's Fund select body
of balltopsors as they were all seasoned
players. Hid. "Helney" Hrug,played his
game the college nine would have been
ehut out without a tally. Krug' pitched
far seven innings like a man throwing
rocks against the side of a house. He'
had as much control of the sphere-as a
novice of an automobile. Kxug sailed
the ball up to the plate like a "balloon and
would laugh at the missing swinge made
at it by the Stanford batters.- -When
"Helney" essayed to let a few links out
of his "wing-" he- would keep - Hammond
reaching all over the field.
Stanford also suffered . through its
pitcher. The colk-ge boys are a band of
earnest players, but they were handi
capped yesterday. A youth named Ben
nett tried for seven innings to make an
impression, but failed. He not only lacks
*j.eed and curve?, but all the other requi
sites that make a good twirler. Bennett's
aspirations as a pitcher were considerably
dimmed in the fourth inning. The husky
insurance nine lit on his shoots and ham
mered out eight hits. The daughter was
terrible to look at and Captain Edwards
r* tired the young man to the bench. Parker
Â¦Â» eÂ«t Into the box and was' an Improve
ment. He has speed and fairly good
ccntrol of the ball and witti proper coach
ing should develop into a good man.
Traeger of football fame is willing,, but
has a habit of letting: the ball pass out
of his mit. He will improve with more
experience.
One or two circus catches, contributed
by Butler and LowenthaJ, aroused the
crowd out of its lethargy. Following Is

ThÂ«^ first home-and-home tournament
between teams of class B players of the
San Francisco and Oakland polf cUibs
took place yesterday on the links at Point
Adams. Each team consisted of eleven
men, the San Francisco players belns cap
tained by "Warren Gregory, and the Oak
landers by P. E. Bowles. The course was
somewhat heavy and the putting-greens
were slow, aÂ» Was shown by the fact that
the players frequently puUed short of tha
cup. The Oaklanders won by a score of
24 to 13, or 11 up. The jneatest â¢'killing?"
for the winners were made by P. E.
Bowles Jr., who beat Andrew Carrigan S
up, and by P. G. Gow and H. M. A. Miller,
each of whom won 5 up. In the first eight
matches San Pi anciaeo -was 4 up, but on
the last three matches Oakland scored U
upÂ»..J. H. MeÂ© of San. Francisco und J.
Ames of Oakland plaved a remarkably
close match, halving - seven out of t :vÂ»
eighteen holes, and oelng: all square at tha
seventeenth hole: Mee took the eighteenth
by a fine, long putt; and won 1 up.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 16.
While playing about a cook stove this
morning .attno ranch of his parents, one
mile from Haywards, John Cardoza, the
lS-months-old child of Mr. and Mrs. Car
doza, was burned to -death, his clothing
catching fire. â¢ The mother and father
were in a field, 'and the baby's brothers
and Bisters tried in vain to save the little
one.
They # narrowly escaped being burned
themselves as they tried to tear' off the
blazing cotton garments that enveloped
the Infant, whose screams attracted the
attention of the parents. . Before the lat
ter arrived - the child's flesh had been
burned to. a crisp and the' clothing was
nearly destroyed. Dr. Alexander of Hay
v.-ards was summoned. . The baby- was
barely alive when he arrived.
The accident occurred in the basement
of the farmhouse where the family re
sided. The i father and mother after
breakfast had gone out .to do some
chores, leaving the baby and older chil
dren. The . little one crawled up- to the
stove and managed to get a small stick
into the wood lire which was burning
briskly. As he withdrew the bit of wood,
which was ignited, sparks. scattered upon
his flimsy â¢ cotton clothing and the gar
ments were in an instant afliime. The
other children were helpless In their strug
gles to extinguish the burning dress and
underclothes because of their fright. By
the time the parents arrived there was no
hope for the infant. . ' . .
Mrs. Cardoza narrowly escaped being
burned herself. As she was tearing uie
blackened shreds of clothing off the child
sparks settled upon her dress, but she
managed to save herself from the fate
that had befallen her little son.
Coroner Mehrmann held an Inquest this
evening at Haywards.'

OAKLAND, Feb. 16.â The Muni
cipal League sounded the key
note of. its campaign at Masonic
Hall this evening when its .cany
dldates made ' the municipal
ownership of â¢ water the issue and
charged that the opposition tickets were
controlled by the Contra Costa Water
Company. The Contra Costa Water Com
pany came in .for a plentiful roasting
irom all the speakers. . '
The meeting was called to- order by
Carey Howard, president of the Muni
cipal League, who tola a. little about the
oiganization ana the lite .of the organ
ization. . He eaid that the same forces
wtie at work m the present campaign
that were at work when the league was
organized, and tnat the same reasons ex
isted now for the league as existed when
It was .born.
Walter O. Manuel, nominee of the
league for Mayor, declared flatly tor
municipal ownership of water supply,
saying:
**There are two available supplies of
water, both of which are amply suUlclent
for the needs of this city, which can be
obtained by the municipality for about
$2,uu0,000. Interest upon me bonds for this
amount would be IIOO.OO.) a year, a sink-
Ing tund for the redemption of these
bonds would mean $50,000 more, and
operating expenses would be $60,000 more,
or a total of $200,000 a year to be raised by
this plant by water rates, as against $473,-
OuO now paid by the rate payers of Oak
land to the Contra Costa -Water Com
pany upon a basis of $4,000,000 valuation,
if the Contra Costa Water Company wins
the suit now pending in the Superior
Court, we will have to pay water rates
upon double that valuation, or nearly
$1,000,000 annually for water rates. As the
city now receives less than half a million
of dollars In taxes each year, we are now
paying nearly as much water rates' as
taxes, and in the event of the company's
winning this suit would have to pay
double the water rates that we do taxes.
"The ownership of a . municipal plant
would not affect taxes, for the plant wouM
pay for itself by water rents. The candi
dates of the Municipal League ticket are
pledged to put the machinery for secur
ing a municipal water supply in operation
at once they are in office."
Judge J. Al. Haven spoke for non-partl
sanlsm in municipal affairs and said tha:
party lines should not control where the
business Interests of the city were af
fected.
W. A. Dow. candidate for City Attorney,
also* spoke in favor of non-partlEaalsm In
city affairs, and then said:
"The Contra' Costa Water Company haÂ»
absolute control of the tickets of tho two
great national parties, and do you want
that corporation to control the affairs of
your city for the next' two years'; i'ou all
know what the Contra Costa Water Com
pany has done In the years gone by when
It controlled the politics of this city. For
a few years there was competition, and
then it bought off Its rival. The first thm<
that it did waÂ» to burn the books of its
rival, and its own. The second thing that
it did was to bring a *.uit to force an ab
normal valuation after having destroyed
the best evidence of the amount of Its in
vestment â the books.
"Under the valuation that they propose
the city will have to pay nearly a million
dollars-in water rates a year. It has be
come a question of whether the city woul'l
acquire a water supply or the water sup
ply acquire the city.
M.'K. Miller, candidate for City En
gineer, said:
"You all know what the Contra' Costa
Water Company has done in this -city for
the last twenty-five years, and .from -Us
present actions it does not seem to have
mended its ways. It is keeping in politic?
In the same old way. It purchased tho
Republican City Central Committee for
gold coin, and- now it is trying to get a
ticket that will do "its bidding-. It does
not want a Mayor that will .-sign a low
water rate ordinance: It does not want
a City Attorney that will prosecute the
water rate suit: it doca not want a City
Engineer that will report favorably upon
'a municipal water supply; It does not
want a City Council that will frame a low
water rate ordinance: it does not. want -a
city officer that will not do its bidding."
Other speeches were made by A. H.
Breed. Felton Taylor; B. C. Cuvellier, A
H. Pratt, and other candidates upon the

OAKLAND. Feb. 35.â The Republi
can City Central Committ-**
opened the municipal campaigi
to-night with a meeting at Elite
Hall, which was addressed by the
party's candidates for the various city
offices.
The meeting was called to order by
Everett Brown, chairman of the Central
Committee. The gathering was enthusias
tic. Ilach of the candidates spoke of th^
need_of municipal^ ownership of water
workVand to"the~hew era of "prosperity
possible under better city administration.
.Mr. Brown made a short address in open-
Ir.g the meeting. He said in part:
"During the administration of our glori
ous rational leader, McKinley, every oth
er part of this great country has made
unprecedented progress. Oakland, a city
second to none in natural advantage*, has
stood still. Every one who knows any
tninr of the trend of municipal govern
ment la our fair city knows that a radi
cal change Is imperative. Now Is the time
for that change."
Mr. Brown introduced Judfe Z. N.
Goldsbv. who presided over the meeting.
Anyon Bantow, the> Republican candi
date for the Mayoralty, was received with
caeers. He said, in part:
"Oakland is naturally the QueÂ«n City of j
the Pacific. Nature baa eaid It and It
remains ror the ciUxens of this favored
municipality to do their part. I pledge
myself, if elected, as I expect to be. uo
co what I can. I urge upon you the
choice of progressive men to till the other
offices on the ticket. My own ambition is
to be able to look back with pride on a
record as chief magistrate of ihe city of
rny home and of all my interests."
F C Turner. Republican nominee for
City Er-gineer, said that It Is at last time
to stop petty Internal bickerings and to
make a united effort to place the city
whera its natural advantages gave it a
right to be.
"I cannot help contrasting Oakland.
with Its splendid location but backward
etate of development, with Los Angele*.
u coxnxanaity whose enterprise has made
tueh a. magnificent showing. It is- time
for us to wake up."
James A. Johnson, the party s nominee
for City Attorney, said:
â¢â¢The three leading municipal platforms
differ on nearly every question, but they
are a unit on tills, that the city has for a
lor.g time bwn afflicted with a Silurian
government, from which It Is high time
to escape.
"The Republican party has been ac
cused of uncertainty on one score â that of
municipal water supply. Now it 1Â» un
deniable that we have and have bad no
end cf trouble over the water furnished
by the Contra Costa Water Company and
the rates we have had to pay for It. In
the trial now going on in the Superior
Court it has developed that an abundant
supply of the purest water 1Â» available to
Oakland, ard I believe that the city
should bÂ« bonded to build municipal
Â¦water works. I believe that we
can reduc* our water rates one

rhould be submitted to the people. And I

"But you are waiting to hear a more

Adam Mantel, whose marital- troubles
have brought htm prominently before the
public as "the man from Mexico," con
ducted arid lost his own case In the di
vorce proceedings brought against him by
his wife before Judge Hall to-day.
The testimony given at the hearing de
picted two thrilling scenes" in the couple's
fleeting married life. Mantel said that
the circumstances In each case goaded
him to the point of madness, a statement
eagerly corroborated by Mrs. Mantel and
concurred in by the court. His Honor re
marked that in ill charity he must pro
ncunce the defendant's actions as ex
tremely eccentric, but he hesitated about
officially deciding that he was insane.
The .first scene ol the story was laid In
Frultyale, the second . In Chihuahua.
Mantel Bald that his first experience of
married bliss was so short he hadn't
time to bid his wife jrood-by and had to
run from the house of the officiating
clergyman to catch his train. He did not
seÂ«j her again for nine months. Mrs.
Mantel said that the second scene. In Chi
huahua, was as brief as 6he could
make it- ' . -.
The couple first met as the result of a
notice Inserted in a San Francisco paper
by Miss Cuthbert applying for a position
as governess. Mantel, who was located In
Mexico as a traveling agent for a brew
ery, answered the advertisement, saying
that he wanted a "young, refined lady,"
not as governess, but as his wife. Mrs.
M. C. Maxwell of Fruitvale. with whom
Miss Cuthbert was living, wrote to Mantel
that she would Introduce him to the
young lady and that they could then de
cide his proposal for themselves. From
Mantel's letter. the match was not an un
desirable one. He said he was receiving
a salary of $300 a month. He neglected
to mention the fact that this was Mexican
rr.oney.
Mantel came to Fryltvale and pressed
his suit. Before matters had reached .-Â»
definite stage he was summoned by wire
to -proceed south Immediately. Mrs. Max
well thought her ward Would be compro
mised unless the pair were married be
fore he left and so a hurried ceremony
was arranged just In time to allow the
groom to catch the steamer for the south,
The bride remained In Fruitvale, sup
ported by remittances from Mantel, for
nine months. Then he wrote that he was
ready for her to Join him In Mexico, but
stipulated that she should come alone.
" He testified that he -was petrified with
horror on receiving a telegram stating
that his wife was on her way to Chihua
hua, accompanied by her friend. Miss
Katnerlne Maxwell. When Mrs. Mantel
arrived he. reproached her for disobeying
his orders, and he admitted on the stand
that in the excitement of the moment he
was more abusive than he Intended to be.
His wife declined to stay with "him . and
left Chihuahua the next day In spite of
Mantel's orders to the Prefect of Police
to detain her. Mrs. Mantel's testimony
related that her Irate spouse created a
farewell scandal at the station, drawing
all the street loungers of Chihuahua to
the place by his loud and abusive tirade.
But her departure from the land of poco
tlempo did not release her from Mantel's
attentions. She said that on their way
home she and her friend Â¦ found . that the
officers had been notified to be on the
lookout for them at every Btop. They
had had thrust upon them the unwelcome
distinction of a place, on the blacklist of
every Chief of Police (from Chihuahua to
Fruitvale.
As his own attorney. Mantel made a plea
to the court, saying that he had been pub
licly scandalized and was a heartbroken
man. The oourt might decide against
him, but there were other ways of attain
ing his ends. This covert threat' was re
peated more openly after the court had
rendered the decree of divorce, and Man
tel was restrained by a deputy sheriff
until Mrs. Mantel had left the courtroom.
"What do you mean by what you Just
eald?" he was asked.
"Timo will tell," said the Â¦ man from
Mexico.

swindling the automatic weighing ma

could dodge it with a wire pushed in un

weighing machinery at work and lets the
needle loose. Another made lt work by
Inserting a knife blado. and another put
in a piece of lead nicely adjusted as to
size and shape. The quiet young man
eald. eoberly. "Why . put in anything?
Blow in the slot, and, jumping upon
the platform, he fastened his mouth over
the slot, and, puffing out his cheeks,
threw a email hurricane into the workg.
Sure enough the thing worked, and tho
needle registered his weight.'
"Well, I declare," paid one man.
"I'll be blowed," eald another, with a
vl*w of proprieties.
"Try it," eaid the young man; it's
easy." . *
So they all tried It, puffed and blew and
distended their cheeks until every one of
them was tired, but It didn't work. ,Â»Â¦.
"Blow harder."
They all blew until exhausted, and still
the needle never budged.

The police officers had much work pro
tecting the last immigrant arrivals from
the swarm of hotel and lodging house run
ners, and many of the strangers were
fairly bewildered by the importunities
hurled at them. . ...
The police officers and men on duty at
the ferry depot have done all In their
power to furnish the Immigrants with
whatever information they possess, but
if an "immigration bureau" were estab
lished at the depot and all immigrants mot
on arrival much good would be accom
plished.
In 1881 when the tide of immigration
to this State wan very large a bureau was
established, and much valuable informa
tion given to ths intending settlers In Cal
ifornia.
./The railroad companies which bring the
immigrants here claim that all responsi
bility ends when the Journey Is finished,
and the railroad officials are of the opin
ion that It. Is duty of the Btate or
various county officials to meet the new
comers on their arrival and see that they
are properly directed.
At the present time considerable litera
ture is being distributed in the East as to
the possibilities of California, and during
the next few months lt is expected that a
great number of immigrants will coma to
California.
In the last few days fifteen hundged im
migrants arrived in this city from-East
ern States and they have been allowed
to reach the end of their Journey with

The report from Washington that Pres
d<r.t McKinley had decided to call an extra
f-sslon of Congress was received with
deep gloom around the railroad offices and
hotels yesterday. It Is thought that the
contemplated vi*it of the President to the
Pacific Coast will now be abandoned, ow
ing to the pressure of official business,
nnd if this should prove true it means a
great law to those who have already
made extensive preparations for thÂ© re
ception cf the Presidential party.

a'.so made elah'-rate preparations to care
for the expected Influx of visitors during
thÂ» Presidential visit
The members of the Ohio Society will
also be greatly disappointed" should the
President fail to rome to CaJifornia th!a
faring. The natives of the Buckeye State
had arranged an elaborate programme for
the entertainment of President McKln
ley. Amons other features of the great
event it was decided to have the Presi
dent attend the launching of the battle-
Khip Ohio that is to take place in May.

LOCAL MARKETS.
NEW TORK. Feb. 16.â There was touch con
fusion and doubt regarding the speculative
outlook manifest In thÂ« movement of prices In
to-day's etock market and the professional
traders were obliged to change sides several
times during the cour*Â« of the short session.
The- opening strength Beeroed to'be due to Lon
don operations and gave way Immediately
Â«*ter the opening. There was manifest ap
prehension over the aliowln* to be made by
th* bank statement. The eteel stocks were re
actionary, partly over the delay In th* an
nouncement of the terms of the merger and
partly over the probability of a probing by
thÂ« Industrial commlsFlon. The internal dls
pcnslons In the smelting company were re
rponslble for the weakness of these Â«ecurities
and 'reported dissatisfaction on the part of
EnirliEh minority stockholders In Anaconda
â¢ftsj; reflected. In & decline In that stock and
In Amalgamated Copper. The mrtal stocks as
e. whole, therefore, made rather a poor show
ing. Tin Plate. National Bteel preferjred and
'*P"Â»derÂ«J Fteel preferred wÂ«n exceptions. Tin
Plate rising at one time 2H over last night
aitd closing with a net gain of l"i. The
strength .of Burlington and of Delaware and
Hudson made the feature of the market. They
led a rally after the opening weakness and
they checked the. selling induced by the bank
statement, modifying what promised to be a
weak closing into dullness and heaviness. As
a rule the list chows nÂ«*t losses ranpins: up to
over a point for many of the prominent trad
ing docks. General Electric lost Sft of its
rise. Tke bank statement proved fully as
weak as the pessimists had propbesled and un
mistakably cortFtitutes a danger signal to spec
ulators, although the rerenlty shown by the
Cntcnclal "world in face ot the showing prevents
any acute apprehension. ThÂ« speculation In
rtocks quieted down *th;s week. The pause in
the excited upward movement of stocks brought
the inevitable realizing movement and the
bearish traders took advantage of this selling
to rut out short lines, but the bears wera by
00 mean* aggressive and they seemed content
with a culÂ£k tarn on the short elde, thus
causing an early check to the declining ten
<5enov and some recoveries; There are too many
pcwFlbllltlea trtill hanging over the market of
further Important developments looking toward
additional consolidation of railroad Interests
end extension of the community of interests
aroong crcat railroad systems and capitalists
W afford n>ucb,A-anta*e ground for bear at
tacks on the market bÂ«>ond the limits of hold-
Ings by weak speculators who have not_ re
eaurces to defend their holdings or to hold
through a decline. There have not been lack-.
Ing signs that the process of absorption or
securities of minor railroads In the intercut* of
large railroad system* has been proceeding
and isolated Instances of -strength have per
sisted .n the -stock lUt all through the re
actionary tendency among: the â¢ standard rail
road Btocks and the jr-cre prominent indus
trials. It U evident that plans are working out
regarding th? Southwestern rallroada and
probably recarfllng alÂ»3 the north and t south.

'"A tmall trade is heard of in fancy unpeeled
peaches, but outside of raisins and prunes there
Is llttls of interest to report. Currant* continue
steady, but demand is not large.
"Prime evaporated apples are scarce on the
rpot. but the market is very quiet. Prime is
offered from up the State at 4%c, laid down In
New York."
"The feature last week in this market was
the speculative movement In raisins, several
local houses taking In ell the California loose
rcuscatels to be had on the spot under 6c for
S-crown goods. Th^re was also some demand
Irom the Middle West. The market on 3
crown at the close was very firm at 6@6%c, and
tales of several hundred boxes were reported
Saturday at 6c to a Jobber. Late in the week
thÂ»>re was pome Inquiry, also supposed to be
of a speculative character, for seeded raisins
on the sr>ot. and it Is not unlikely there may
be developments in this quarter of the market
*arl> this yeek. Coast seeded raisins here are
now considerably below the cost at which
roods can he Said down from California. 1m

Mess Pork, per barrel-
lines in the central traffic territory, but these
are not of such overwhelming Importance as
the numerous projects which went before and
did not serve to hold the great list of stocks.
The readiness of the speculative public to re
spond to any suggestion of a combination for
rome time past has b>en taken advantage of
by powerful speculative pools to advance prices
of certain stocks by manipulation and there
was very large profit-taking during the week
by several of these pools which made inroads
upon the prices with the lessened outside de
mand fcr stocks. The Tuesday holiday in
terrupted the continuity of the speculation and
had the Inevitable effect of Inducing some
closing of accounts. The. fact that much of
the recent speculation has been on the pre
sumption of financial plans not fully matured
causes some conservatism about further specu
lative \entures. The reports of dissension*
over the merger of the American Smelting and .
Refining Company and the Guggenheim in
terests and the resulting break in the prices
cf smelting stocks offered disagreeable pos
sibilities of difficulties arising even in the last
stages of effecting a consolidation. The colos
sal steel merger has been a varying and un
certain shadow on the market all week. . Wall
street has not wavered in the conviction that
the merger was in process of accomplishment,
but the terms have been subject to perpetual
surmise and gossip. There has been a sig
nificant interest In thÂ« future officer* and ad
ministration of this giKantlc industrial force,
arlde from the details of financial adjustment,
which ore in themselves of vast Importance,
especially In the existing course of things In
the money market. The fact that no American
tenders were received for the new British ex
chequer bond issue must be regarded as highly
significant of the extent to which American
resources cf capital are being absorbed for
domestic Investment. The figures of the coun
try's foreign trade for January add to this
significance, indicating cs they do an undlm
inlehed rate of increase of our foreign credits.
There are many indications that the return
of American securities from abroad has been
on an unprecedented scale lately, but the con
clusion cannot be escaped that an enormous
balance remains due and unpaid from the rest
of the world to this Country. That Europe
will be able to spare gold in liquidation Of her
indebtedness seems improbable, in spite of the
current ease of money abroad, which is largely
due to diminishing business activity and the
large expansion of government credits for mil
itary purposes. Experience shows that stock
exchange speculators might be subjected to
all the rigors of a monÂ»y panic before sufficient
effect would be produced on the foreign ex
changes to bring relief -and even the domestic
exchanges are trot always prompt' to respond.
These considerations probably underlie the hes
itation developed in the recent rampage:

The Spartan spirit of/the hull interest in
wheat became apparent Then, with only the
reflected strength, of corn to help it, the wheat
price waa maintained against a" collection of
bearish news. Liverpool â¢ and continental
cables were weak. May wheat opened %@%c
lower at 75*4c to 75%c and rallied with corn to
75%c during the forenoon. Following this the
market responded to the break in corn by drop
ping to 75WÂ©75-%c. The' final upturn in corn
carried wheat up to 75V4@75%c and the close
was unchanged -at 75%c.
Oats were fairly active and higher in sym
pathy w*lth corn. May closed %@%o higher at
25% c.
' Provisions were moderately active^ . The mar
ket opened, lower because of heavy hog receipts.
An 'advance /followed In response to the corn
Strength, but this merely served to cause sell
ing by local interests and the market reacted
and closed easy. May pork closed 5c "lower
and lard and ribs each %c depressed.
The leading futures ranged' as follows:
CHICAGO, Feb. 16.â The corn market con
cluded a\. bull week .with its .activity 'and
strength undlminlshed and prices on a new and
higher level.. It ' approached' the environs of
the "natural squeeze." The talk was of empty
cribs, of farmers who showed no. disposition to
soli and of the exceedingly poor showing of
new arrivals when they came under the eye
qf the inspectors. May opened %@Uc lower at
40%c *p 40Vic under -pressure from - outside in
terests. The crowd, however, was bullish al
most to a man and the market- rallied to 40%c-
On ' the advance there was ' renewed outside
buying led by St. Louis interests, but on realii
ing sales May reacted to 4OÂ»4c. Under a heavy
general demand the price shot up to 41Vic and
Boon, after %Â©â¢>Â»<} over, yesterday at 41Uc, with
the demand still clamorous, where it closed.

The New York Financier Eays: For the first
Urns in their history the clearing house banks
of New York City report deposits in excess
cf one thousand million dollars, standing at
, $1,011,329,000. There deposits are net and In
clude only actual items entering into that
definition. Â¦ The gross deposits aro in reality
much higher. The constant growth of the fig
ures since the opening of the year has been
little lees t!ian amazing. Since January 5 de
posits have expanded more than ?140,0C0.000 and
loans $110,500,000. Despite the strain on their
rower to which these Increases subjected the
banks they hold without about $20,500,000 as
much excess reserve as was reported at the
opening of the year. But the current state
ment shows practically the same operations
that have been in evidence now for several
weeks. Loans increased for the week $19,333,
600, of which amount five large banks report
the largest proportion, and deposits expanded
J16.735.100, traceable also to a few lnetltutlons.
The important feature of the statement in a
measure rests in the revelation of the diminish
ing rhlpments of money to this center from the
interior, and' the absorption â¢ of cash by the
treasury, the cause of this week's loss having
bÂ«en forecasted in this analysis last week.
How long the present operations In the loan
market will continue is uncertain, but' it needs
no superior Judgment to show -that with the
loan item growing at. an unprecedented rate,
producing a proportionate expansion of depos
its, and with actual cash decreases going on
the surplus reserv* must be seriously affected.
The decrease In this Item f or ihe week was'$7,
610,175,- which brings Ihe present surplus tn
! $12,852,450. Last year Â¦ the surplus fell from
124,000,000 on February 17 to less than $3,000,000
on March 7, and.. the leading causes are more
pronounced . now than then. . Syndicate, opera
tions are responsible for the advances shown
of late. It is interesting to note that while the
increase in the loans of fiixty-three. nahks since
January 6 have been $110,000,000, two large banks
are responsible for nearly $40,000,000 of the en
tire gain and six banks ' Identified with- the
same or similar interests have expanded their
loans nearly $70,600,000 or 64 per cent and over
of the total gains since January. This throws
a strong light on the character of the year's
expansion to date. - . .

OCEAN TRAVEL.Mr. Thomas has sent several bottles. of
the brandy to a Chemist for anaylsis, with
a . view of discovering .-whether any
;"blackstrap" was used In its manufac
ture. < -. Â¦, s. ......
After receiving Agent Thomas' report
Mr. Lynch ordered Deputy Collector L.
C. -Wlttenmyer of Martinez to Beize and
hold the distillery for the Government,
but the order was- countermanded at a
later hour by Mr. Lynch upon representa
tions made by Judge Bridgford, Mr. Mal
ter's attorney, that he would give Mr.
Lynch all the information asked for.
The matter has been continued until
Monday, when the report of the chemist
will be received together with Mr. Mal
ter's statement as to the disposition of
the "blackstrap."
The distillery is valued at $100,000.
After some further/talk on the subject
Mr. Malter called Agent Thomas aside and
said that the tanks contained wine and
about 5 per cent of sugar about to be
made Into brandy. He explained also that
the thousand barrels of "blackstrap"
that had been shipped to the distillery
.were to be used for fertilizing purposes In
the vineyard. -" %
Mr. Thomas found on the premises elev
en tanks each of 5000 gallons capacity.
When he asked .the distiller what they
contained the latter replied "only distill
ing material." Finally the revenue agent
received the information that the 'tanks
contained only raisins and water; that
they did not contain wine, and that he
had not been distilling wine on the prem
ises at all.

Mr. Merril pleaded-, that . he was ignor
ant of any such part of the receipt, but
his plea was overruled. The judgment
and order of the lower â¢court were there
fore, reversed. - . -
In accordance with a State law a com
mon carrier is responsible for the loss of
property-through the gross negligence or
willful wrong of. an owner or an em
ploye. The defense proved that the em
ploye In ; question weis guilty 0* neither
of these offenses. .
The court then held that by accepting
the receipt . which was ; given him Mr.
Merril entered Into a lawful contract that
If the trunk was lost he should receive*
only $100, the amount for which the com
pany insured its transfer.
Mr. Merril proved approximately the
value of the goods lost, and the court
granted a decision in his favor to the
amount of $350: Appeal was at once taken
and the matter went to the Supreme
Court. *
The Supreme Court rendered a fiedsiqn
yesterday which will be of Interest to
travelers. It appears that Charles Mer
rllj. on arriving in this city, gave his
trunk to a.n employe of the Pacific Trans
fer Company and accepted a receipt there
for. The trunk never, came and an Inves
tigation was Instituted, which revealed
the fact that it had been stolen. No trace
of It could be found. The company offered
to pay Mr. Merril $100, the amount for
which the trunk 1 was insured, according to
the terms of the receipt.
The offer was declined, on the ground
that the true valuation- 4 of the contents
of the trunk was greatly in excess of the
amount offered. Negotiations stopped at
once and Uie matter was carried to the
courts.' â¢

ors yesterday. In which It states 'that I It

ent time to remove all 6lgns dnd|trahs

It recommends the passage' of ant ordi
nance, which It has drafted, design*! to

parallel to the- surface of the buildings,
drum signs attached to the pillars or en
trances to buildings and pole signs which

Inches over the sidewalk. . The ordinance
will permit of the erection of clock signs
on the outer edge of sidewalks, provided
they are mounted on a single pole and
