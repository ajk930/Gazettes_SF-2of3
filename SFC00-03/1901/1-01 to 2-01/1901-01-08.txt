SENATE MAKES BIG INCREASE.
Personages and Scenes Attendant Upon the Opening of the Thirty-Fourta, Session of the Legis-
For the remainder of this week patron
age will be an absorbing object of atten
tion in legislative circlec. Both the Sen
ate and the ' Assembly have already de
cided to Increase thÂ« patronage, vr' 'ch
"certainly is ; not an- encouraging sign â¢ in
connection with the Governor's cry' for
economy.
In legislative affairs â¢ to-day the Demo
cratic minority In each house remained In
decorous, submissive sllance. The Dem
ocrats are so hopelessly out of the field,
politically, that they Â«ure seeking only to
snatch here and there a crumb of patron
age thrown to them by the Republicans.
One of these they received "to-day, when
the minority In the Assembly was per
mitted to elect a clerk and place him up
on J the pay roll. "The Democrats chose
ex- Assemblyman Crowly of San â¢ Fran
cisco, who at the last session refused to
give Mayor Fhelan of San Francisco . his
complimentary vote for the United States
Senate. This probablv will be the only
opportunity which' llie Democrats will
have to play even with the Mayor of the
metropolis.
â¢A howl of dissatisfaction and dismay
went up to-day from the bibulous spirits
of other sessions, and the curious of this
discovered ; that the "well," that historic
scene of orgies, debauches and unseemly,
revelry In the Capitol, was closed by the
'peremptory ; orders of- Secretary ; of 'State
Charles Curry. The Secretary of State de
clares most emphatically that the "weil"
will not be opened this session unless he
is commanded to open It by orders of the
Assembly,; which has Jurisdiction over it
during the session of the Legislature. The
"well" has been, the scene of some of the
most famous as well as the most Infa
mous political incidents of the State.
sideration. The "third house" is getting
ready for business, but some of Its lead
ing members will not arrive until next
week. Martin Kelly l&, of course, striv
ing to, keep his flock In line In order that
he may .reap the golden fruits of his vic
tory. Jere Burke is representing the
Southern Pacific Company, Johnny Lynch
anybody who wants to employ him and
Jake Shaen himself.
A great deal of speculation attaches,
therefore, to Pendlctor/s choices. They
were made yesterday, but to-day there
was another ehakeup ard some positions
are still in doubt. Some- are known defi
nitely from the forces which control Pen
flletcn and are published this morninj;.
Pendleton believes that he may need until
vhich will have so much to do with the
legislation of the session. The result of
the ccntest for Speaker of the Assembly
has had a most irnrx>rtant reaction upon
' the Republican members of the Senate.
The election of Pendleton was accom
plished by the Governor, by notoriously
operating Southern Pacific Influences, by
paloon politicians of San Francisco and
t we;p!r.g promises of patronage and posi
tion. The Republican Senators knew that
ail of this means that the Assembly will
ue dominated by the Governor and his
Billed forces and .that committees will be
formed as these Incongruous Influences
dictate. Republican Senators are deter
mined, therefore, that they shall not be
dominated by the chief executive and his
friends and through Lieutenant Governor
Neff they will insist upon appointing their
own committees and In a measure pre
rerve the constitutional separation of the
executive and legislative departments of
the State government. Lieutenant Gov
ernor N'eff declares that he will probably
announce the Senate committees to-xnor
row.
The appointment of Assembly commit
tee* is a much more complicated matter.
It will be purely a Question of programme
and an effort to satisfy the demands of
the various Interests involved. Gage muat
be recognized and the interests of the
Southern Pacific Company must be rs-
Fpeeted. Martin Kel!v must have what
bÂ« asks for and that "Till be something
* ssentlally detrimental to the State. Kel

and to-morrow afternoon the Gov
ernor's message, very much given to
Â¦svorfis. â¢will be read to both houses. The
Assembly was organized early this after
noon by the election of Its chief officers.
C. W. Penileton was chosen Speaker, hav
ing no Republican opponent. The friends
cf Anderson were true to their promise,
and, notwithstanding the fact that they
were released from any obligation to vote
for him, insisted upon doing: so in caucus.
In the Senate there was neither factional
r.or geographical contest. Thomas Flint
ir. was elected chairman pro tern, asd
leading patronage offices were district
ed according- to the agreement made In
caucus.
The scenes which marked the organiza
tion of both houses were remarkable In
one particularâ they were noticeably with
out enthusiasm. In the Senate chamber
a few people congregated to witness the
opening ceremonies. Politicians, lobby
ists, men and women followers of politi
cians, a sprinkling- of Sacramentans and
prospective attaches made up the crowd.
Flowers on the desks of some of the Sen
ators testified to the fact that they have
admirers, but there were no demonstra
tion, no applause; simply the rigid for
r:a2ities. which ended in the notification
to the Governor that the Senate was ready
fj r ihe business of state.
In the Assembly a large ! crowd had
ETP.thered. and if the formalities of organ
ization were not more impressive they
wf re longer. The chamber was brilliantly
adorned with tricolor bunting and na
tional flags. There were a few women In
The galleries, who listened to the speeches
of nomination. When Pendleton was
Â«lected there was a generous response of
applause and then the Interest flagged.
The Assembly as well as the Senate ad
journed until to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock, when the Governor*8 message
will be received.
Both houses have yet to perform a vital
ly important duty. The President of the
Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly
must appoint the standing committees.

One Industry Seriously Affected by
the Spread of tho Typewriter.
"During the past year," said a Nassau
street stationer, "we have sold only half
the number of steel pens we sold la 1390.
And I would not be surprised to seo the
sales of pens fall off until only a few
stationers in town carried large stocks
of them. This," I think, ia due to the ad
vent of the typewriting machine.
"In almost every business house in tha
city typewriters are in use. and In sotnÂ»
houses they have a system of keeping
books with typewriting machines. In the
County Register's office all the records
were for years kept with pen and Ink.
but now the copyists employed there aro
compelled to work typewriting machines.
Deeds are copied Into record books wltn
the aid of the typewriter, and the eor/ytet
of to-day has not the political slnecur-3
he had a few years ago. when any school
boy was competent to be a copyist in th-i
Register's office. Hundreds of boxes of
steel pens were In use there In those day*,
but now they uso only about 1 per cer*;
of the quantity formerly required.
"I would not be surprised if within th^
next few years several pen manufactur
ers save up business. Few people know
what a heap of bother and expense it 13
to make & pen. For instance, the steel
is first rolled into big sheets, and then
cut Into stripe about three Inches wide.
These strips are annealed. In other woni Â»
they are softly heated to a red heat and
permitted to cool very gradually, so tha:
the brittleness Is all removed and tho
steel is soft enough to be easily worked.
Then the strips are again rolled to tho
required thickness, or rather thinness, for
as you know the average steel pen is not
thicker than a piece of letter paper.
"The blank pen is nÂ«xt cut out of tho
flat strip and the name of tha maker
stamped upon It. Then comes the mold
ing process. The pen is put in a mold
â¢which gives It grace and strength. Th<Â»
rounding enables the pen to hold tha
requisite Ink and to distribute the Ink
gradually. That little hole which is cut
near the end of the slit- also helps t>
moke the ink run properly and regulate*
the elasticity of the pen. Up to this
time the metal Is soft and Ieadllke. To
make it brittle and springy it Is tempered
by being heated to a cherry color and
then suddenly plunged into cold water.
But It Is then too brittle for use, so the
temper of the steel must be drawn. Th*
elasticity varies with the color, and each
color is obtained by suddenly pJungins:
the pen into cold water. Then follow the
slitting, polishing, pointing and flnlsnint;.
all of which Is done by expert workmen.
"But the price of pens has fallen greatlv
of late. and. as I said before, with the ad
vent of the new century, there will prob
ably be fewer pens manufactured an-1
more typewriters put to work."â Netr

FOR DIVISION OF IDAHO.
Plan^ to Annex Northern Portion to

SPOKANE, Jan. 7.â Plans are being
formed here to secure the annexation Of
the northern part of Idaho to tho State of
Washington. State Representative H. D.
Lorltt Is planning: to bring this project
before the Legislature at: Its coming ses
sion. The purpose Is to add to this State
the entire region known " as "the Pan
handle." lying : north oC\ the forty-sixth
parallel, which is the southern boundary
of Washington, s This would Include Koc
tenal. Shoshone. Latah and Nez Pcrce and
part of Idaho County, takinpr In all of the
famous Coeur d'Alene silver-lead mining
district; as well as most of*the rich Clear
water gold fields.
.The plan Is received with, enthusiasm
here, and Northern Idaho has In the past
voted 'in favor of such annexation Â¦ by â¢ an
overwhelming majority.. It is argued that
Southern Idaho would \ now consent' be
cause of the lack of railway connection
between the two parts of the State, and
especially because of the great expense
resulting ' from ' the : mmlrfg riots in tho

MENTO, JanJ 7.â The Assembly commit
tee on rules met to-night and decided to
recommend the adoption of the standing
rules of the thirty-third session, with the
addition of two committeesâ an apportion
ment committee and a committee on the
revision of the code, the latter to co-op
erate with the Judiciary committee.
Senate lobby to-day that the proposition
to divide Santa Clara County would be
presented to the Legislature In the form
of a general bill, such as the amended
constitution authorizes. The Senators
representing the county are Inclined to
hold that the advocates of the division
will not submit the measure at this ses
sion. The Immense sums of money ex
pended to bring about the division of
Colusa County and the creation of Glenn
County are mentioned, and the argument
Is advanced that the interests seeking the
division of Santa Clara County could not
be persuaded to contribute the means
necessary to Insure the success of the
fight.
It Is proposed to ta.ke a strip from the

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 7.â Now that the ppeaker
ship fight is over, legislation is beginning
to appear among the counter currents of
the search for places. Several bills that
will be of more than ordinary interest will
be Introduced in the early part of the ses
sion, among them being an inheritance
tax measure, which will be introduced In
the Senate, probably by Rowell. It may
also be introduced simultaneously in the
Assembly. The bill Includes the salient
points of the old collateral inheritance tax
and adds to it a ta:* on direct inheritances.
The tax provided is a small one, amount-
Ing to from one-half of 1 per cent to 1 per
cent, and It Is provided in the measure
that the revenue therefrom shall g-o to
the State University. The old collateral
Inheritance tax, amounting to about 5 per
cent, was turned Into the school fund, and
under the bill to be Introduced, this pro
vision will not be Interfered with, but It
will be provided that the new direct tax
shall be used to help swell the revenue of
the State University.
Another bill which will help out th.*
State University is one providing a gradu
ated fee for corporations, both foreign
Rnd domestic, dolni business In this State.
The plan Is to grade the fee In proportion
to tho capital; provided, however, that th<Â«
fee shall not exceed $500. The present few
of $25 for articles of Incorporation goes
to tne State Library fund. -Thla-ttae bill
will not disturb, but the bill will provid*
that the Increase over the* present $23 feÂ«
shall belong to the university. -.._ ; .

A prominent dairyman says the result

Impossible for grass to grow through the
debris remaining upon thÂ«Â« fields. The
consequence Is that dairymen in the
flooded districts will have ni? grass for
their cattle. It. will be necessary for them
to replow these fields and reseed them.
This, of course, will entail a serious losd
upon dairymenâ a loss that cannot be esti

HUNDREDS OF CATTLE
PERISH IN THE STORM
VANCOUVER, B. C. Jan. 7.â Major
Bennett, senior officer In the Duke of Con
naught's Own Rifles, created a sensation
on Sunday evening In an attack he made
upon the soldiers who refused to turn out
to church parade In the thick of a blind
ing snow storm. The soldiers showed
their resentment by hissing: the major,
and to-day his attack was the talk of the
town. Only half the strength of the regi
ment had turned out, and when they re
turned â¢ to the drill hail Major Bennett
opened fire. He said that the compli
mentary remarks oZ' Colonel Worsnop
were intended only for the men who were
present.
"Those who refused to turn out to-day
are a pack of curs. The,y axe fair weath
er soldiers." the irate major continued,
"and not nt to wear the Queen's uniform.
They are a disgrace to the regiment, and
if I had my way every man who did not
turn out to-day would be discharged and
his uniform called in."
The absentees were very wroth to-day.
One non-commissioned officer, who de
clined to march throueh a -foot of snow,
said: "Xo Canadian will stand such treat
ment as Major Bennett threatens, an.l
the sooner he finds it out tho better it
will be for the Duke of Connaught's Own
Rifles."

OLD-TIME ARCHITECT
GOES TO HIS MAKER
James E. Wolfe, Designer of Many Prom
jnent; Structures Throughout This
JAMES E. WOLKE, who was one of
the oldest architects in this State,
passed away at his residence on
Post street Monday morning at the
advanced agre ,of 80 years. Al
though he was a man of marked abilities,
he was of a retiring disposition and little
known outside of his profession and the
fraternal societies of which he was a
member. . :<Â®S*Â«-2SlS9*? t !*** 5r ? s ?
Mr. Wolfe was horn at Baltimore In 1820.
After having learned to dc an architect
he came to this city In the spring of; '51.
He was acquainted with many of the pio
neers of the State and assisted in build
ing up , San Francisco. Some, of the old
buildings that serve as landmarks I in va
rious parts of the citv ; were constructed
by him. His work was not alone confined
to this city, but may be found In many
parts of the .State. He succeeded In
amassing a large fortune, but Invested
in stocks and lost a large portion of-- It.
The deceased was an officer . of both
the Druids and Knlg-nts of 'Pythias.' -..The
Architectural Review was founded by him
In 1872. His son," George H. Wolfe, Is now
editor of it. A wife, Elizabeth, and three
children. George H. . Wolfe, Mrs. N. Has
ty and Mrs. E>. V. Dodge, survive the de

TAXATION RELATIONS WITH
THE INSULAR POSSESSIONS
. CALL BUREAU, 140Â« G STREET, ;N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.âComplica
tions are again clouding the Chinese sit
uation. - A dispatch was received to-day
from Minister Conger confirming the re
poct of tho failure of the Chinese envoys
to sign the preliminary . agreement
reached by the powers. The. Indemnity
question is causing the authorities con
cern, and the agitation felt In European
channels over the Russo-Chlnese ' agree
ment regarding Manchuria has communi
cated itself to the officials here. /
Minister Conger will try to Induce the
Chinese envoys to accept promptly the
preliminary demands of the powers and
begin negotiations for a . permanent
treaty. The State Department has ad
dressed Inquiries to the powers as to the
method to be pursued to reach a" speedy
and effective disposition' of the claims for
Indemnity. I
Europe will be allowed to' deal with the
Ruaso-Chlnese . agreement, the United
States not entering, for the present at
least, into their discussion or Impugning
Russia's purpose to evacuate Manchuria.
At. the same time the authorities think It
advisable for the protection of American
interests to keep advised of Russia's <SJn
duct, although it is not watched with the
keenness that every act of Germany and
Great Britain Is scrutinized.
It is understood. that the Cabinet meet-
Ing to-morrow will consider the Chinese
question especially with relation , to In
demnity, and it" is expected that this Gov
ernment will . finally recommend that the
matter be left to The Hague court of ar
bitration. .
PEKING. Jan. 7.â The report that the
Chinese court has instructed the Chinese
peace envoys to sign the Joint note of the
powers is confirmed." The court referred
to the objection to the southern viceroys,
which are the same as tha court has.
Prince Chlng. however, . informed the
court that it was " too late and a reply
from the court is expected shortly.
Solicitor General Replies to Ex-Presiden
Harrison in the Porto Rico Cases.
Mr. Carlisle objected to the . consolida
tion of the Crassman case, involving- the
legality of duties collected on goods com
ing to the United States from Hawaii
and it accordingly was not included In the
consolidated list of five. That case and
others involving cognate questions will be
argued after'the conclusion of the consoli
dated cases, so that ltls probable the re
mainder of the week will be given ,up by
the court to.the question of the relation
of the United States to Its insular posses
sions.
The argument In the United States
Supreme Court In the Porto Rican
cases. Involving the question 1 of the
legality of duties Imposed by this coun
try on goods shipped from the United
States to Porto' Rico and from Porto Rico
to the United States, did not begin to
day, as other cases preceding had the ef
fect of postponing it until to-morrow. The
court, however, took sufficient cognizance
of the eases to decide what time should
be given to each side of the controversy
The question was raised by former Secre
tary Carlisle, who stated that five of the
cases could be consolidated. These five
are the casen of Dell ma and others versus
Collector Bid well, S. B. Downs versus Col
lector Bidwell. two cases of H. W. Dooley
versus the United States and Carlos Axm-
Btrong versus the United States. Upon
suggestion the court awarded five hours
to each side of the controversy.
Mr. Carlisle stated that these cases In
volved the double question of the power
of the United States to levy duty on goods
being shipped in both directions, the ques
tion, regarding the Imposition of -duties
on goods going into Porto Rico being en
tirely new.
In a recent address, a portion or which I
understand has been brought to the attention
of the court, a distinguished statesman and
lawyer affects to believe that, if the view of
the Government is correct Congress could,
without constitutional objection, pass a Porto
Rican act providing for a number of shocking
things. The Government has never asserted
and does not believe that Congresa has the
power of a desDot In Porto Rica The funda
mental limitations In favor of personal rights
which ere formulated in the constitution and
Its amendments, referred to- by Mr. Justice
Bradley, stand In the way of everything sug
gested which shocks the moral eenee. Con-
Kress could not pase an ex post facto law. or
oeclare an attainder, or grant any title of
nobility, or provide . for that trial or punish
ment of treason other than In the way markeii
out by the constitution, all these things be
ing prohibited by direct. and applicable pro
visions. If the first ten amendments do not
limit, by direct . application. Congresa In legis
lating for our new possessions, neither do they
operate within : the States which compose tha
Union. As this court, speaking by Chief Jus
tice Vvaite, said In United States vs. Crulk
shank et al. (92 U. S., 641. 572):
.'"The first amendment to the constitution
prohibits Congress from abridging the right of
the people to assemble and to petition the Gov
ernment for a redress of grievances."
This, like other, amendments, proposed and
adopted at the same time, was not Intended to
limit the powers of the States, but to operate
upon the National Government alone.
Protection of life, liberty and property rests
primarily with the State, as Chief Justice Ful
ler said In re Kemmler U35 U. S. 438, 448)'
"Tho constitution makes no provision for pro
tecting the citizens of the respective States In
their reNclous liberties; this is left to the
State constitutions and law."

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 7.-According to
the testimony adduced before the Con
gressional investigating committee which
Is inquiring Into the charges of hazing at
the West Point Military Academy Oscar
I* Booz at Bristol, Pa., and John E. Breth
of Altoona, Pa., had a rough time of It
during their "plebe" year at. that insti
tution. â¢
The case of John Breth of Altoona, Pa.,
who died from an ailment which it Is al
leged he received Indirectly as a result
of hazing at West Point, was taken up.
Dr. E. E. Goodman of Altoona, the Breth
family physician, said Broth's physical
condition before entering/ the military
academy was excellent. Dr. Goodman
treated him two weeks after he came
home from West Point for hemorrhages.
Last October he again treated him for
typhus pneumonia, from which he died.
Young Breth never told Dr. Goodman
anything about hazing at West Point.
All the information the doctor, had came
to him from the boy's family. Breth beÂ»
came very nervous about the time he re
turned from West Point, . and the physi
cian often wondered what could have
caused it.
It had been reported that Breth was
compelled to eat soap at West Point.
The doctor knew nothing about that, but
if the boy had eaten soap It would have
explained his physical condition on his
return home.
Bamuel J. Breth, father of Cadet Breth,
was notified that his son was dismissed
from the academy because of deficiency
in mathematics. Mr. Breth said most of
the family had received letters from the
son in regard to the hardships at West
Point. The father and mother knew that
the boy? at the academy were more or
less hazed, and Cadet Breth and his
brother Harry had an understanding be
tween them that if they had anything to
write about hardships John would write
to Harry only, so that the parents would
not worry. He said Harry and one of the
daughters visited John at the academy
In August, 1SS7, and on their return home
they said John had been severely hazed
and that he had nervous- prostration. At
West Point John told them he had been
so severely hazed that he became uncon
scious. The only one that was men
tioned as being among the hazers was a
cadet named Helder. The father learned
from the son Harry that John had been
"choo-cho<M?d." On his deathbed, the
father said, the boy went through the
"choo-choolng" motions.
Harry Breth, the brother, was called
and offered to submit copies of extracts
of letters he received from John. The
decided that it wanted the
originals, which are now at the Breth
homestead In Altoona. He was . excused
until the letters could be produced and
In order that Miss Rose M. Breth. a sis
ter, might return home and send them to
the committee her testimony was then
taken. She received a letter from her
brother while be was in West Point hos
pital, in which he said the surgeon told
him that he had a light attack of nervous
prostration from overwork. John, how
ever, told the other members of the fam
ily when they visited him at West Point
that his condition was due to hazing.
John said he was hazed three times In one
night. John wrote home that he had to
eat eight slices of bread soaked- in mo
lasses. â¢
Miss Breth said: "On his deathbed he
told me 'West Point is the cause of the
breakdown of my health.' He mentioned
the names of Bender and Young as being
'awful hazers.' "
While in the hospital, she said, John
told her that he was visited by upper
class men and told "that he had better
get out of here."
William A. Hreth, another brother of
John Breth, told substantially this story:
"When John came home he told me that
he had to do so much 'eagllng-'- that he
.often became exhausted and his mus
cles felt like leather. A caOet named
Bender made him Bit on the point of a
bayonet until he fell off. He was made
to sit on it acrain. and during this opera
tion Bender played a violin. On another
occasion, a hot July day, after a hard
day's drill, he was compelled to don a
raincoat and hold out dumb-bells. On Sat
i urday all cadets were given a certain
i amount of liberty, but Bender prevented
him from leaving camp. My brother made
a complaint about It, which resulted in
I Bender exercising him severely. He re
garded the 'feet inspection' as a joke. One
night he was dragged out of bed,- leaving
the bedclothes behind him, and was
dragged over rough stones in the company
street. On another occasion he was so
exhausted by exercising that on the next
morning- the ofllcer In charge of the drill
compelled himKo drop out of line because
! of his weakness."
E. A. Bielenberg.
Mary C. Breth, another sister of Breth,
was called and corroborated the testimony
of. the other members of the family. She
said her brother told her that one night
he was hazed t>y three separate sets of
cadets. He stood the first two. but faint
ed during the third act of hazing:. When
he regained consclousness-he saw several
men rubbing liim. They appeared to be
greatly frightened. Miss Breth also said
that her brother. In speaking of hazing,
said he Â¦ "often ate soap" and "chewed
rope ends" at West Point.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â Solicitor Gen
eral Richards,- in- behalf of the Govern
ment, to-day, filed in the United States
Supreme Court a brief in the case brought
by Ellas S. A. de Lima, Caleb B. Downes,
Henry '.W. Dooley, Carlia Armstrong and
George tV.'CrosBman against George Bid
well, Collector of the Port of New York,
or the United States directly, all involv
ing 1 questions of taxation relations be
tween the United States and our insular
possessions. The cases cover the. several
phases of the dominion -of the United
States over the Islands before and after
the ratification of the Paris treaty' of
peace and after legislation by Congress
with reference toward them.
The feature of the brief is the direct no
tico it takes of ex-President Harrison's
address at Ann Arbor and the response
made thereto .'n behalf of the administra
tion.
The Do Lima case concerns duties col
lected on sugars imported injo New York
from Porto Rico after the ratification of
the Paris treaty and before the passage
of the Porto Rican act; the Downers case
duties on oranges brought from Porto
Rico into New York after the passage of
the Porto Rican act; the Dooley cases and
the Armstrong case duties on goods im
ported from Porto Rico during military
operations and partly before and partly
after the ratification of the treaty, and
also after passage of the Porto Rican
tariff act, and the Crossman case duties
on liquors Imported from Honolulu into
New. York after the passage of the reso
lution annexing the Hawaiian Islands and
the passage of the act providing for their
government.
The reference to ex-President Harrison's
Ann Arbor address is preceded by v a state
ment of the Government's position with
reference to the extent to which the con
stitution applies to newly acquired terri
tory- The brlof denies the doctrine of ex
proprla vigore, and that all the limitations
of the constitution apply everywhere
throughout the scope of the authority of
the Government, but Bays there are limi
tations In the Â¦ constitution which apply
throughout both the States and Territo
ries, organized and unorganized.- Because
some limitations apply It does not follow
that all apply. Those which do apply
everywhere, both within and without the
United States in Its broadest sense, it
says, are those securing the blessings of
justice and liberty to all the people. Ty
ranny and oppression cannot constitution
ally exist under the sovereignty of the re
public, whose founders declared that all
men are entitled to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. This is what air.
Justice Bradley meant when he said in
Mormon church vs. United States (136 U.
S.. 1, 44): "Doubtless Congress. In legis
lating for the Territories, would be sub
ject to those fundamental limitations in
favor of personal rights which are formu
lated In the 'jonstitutlon and Its amend
ments, but these limitations would exist
rather by inference and the general spirit,
of the constitution, from which Congress
derives all Its powers, than- by any ex
press and direct application of its pro
visions."
This statement of the Government's
standing ground leads it up to the notice

Smith, who Is well connected in tha
East, arrived ihere about three months
ag-o and registered at the Grand . Hotel.
He had a large sum of money with him
and. diamonds valued at more than $2000.
In an evil moment, so he claims, he met
a racetrack habitue, . who Induced him to
place a bet on a certain horse. - The horse
tailed to ,','show," and- determined to re
coup his small losses Smith went to the
track the next day and bet all the money
he had, amounting to J1S0O on a "cinch,"
as he thought. When the race was over
the unfortunate young man found that he
had bet on the wrong horse, and finding
himself penniless he concluded to pawn
his diamonds. With the money obtained,
on the precious - stones he again visited
the track,: and 'taking" "the ; "tip" of a
"wise" tout, whom he had known in the
East, he "went . down the line," 'only to
lose all the money., he had. - - . .
Friendless and without enough money to
get a meal, Smith walked Into the Palace
Hotel and going to the bookstand stole
two volumes of Dickens'/ works while th<Â»
attention of the cTerk was temporarily dis

has stolen at least sixteen other valuable
books from the same place.
Last evening McMahon and Wren stood

WASHINGTON. Jan. 7.â The Navy E>Â©
partment has been Informed that the citi
zens of Seattle have pledged themselves
to raise a fund of $100,000 to be paid to
Moran Brothers, the local shipbuilding
concern. Â¦ to enable them to accept the
proposal of the Navy Department to build
a battleship at the figure named in thÂ«Â»
act of Congress. To comply with the de
partment's requirements the Morans must
reduce their bid $200,000, so that even with
this bonus of $100,000 the net reduction
must be $100,000.
Nothing has been heard positively from
the other bidders to whom similar pro
posals were addressed by the department,
but it Is very ir.uch doubted that they
will be able to accept. In that case a
change in plans and readvertlsement will
follow, to reduce the cost of the ships, in
volving the sacrifice of about 1500 tons dis

CHARGED TO THE WIDOW
WASHINGTON. Jan. 7.-A notable
Epeech was delivered in the Senate to-day
by Lodge of Massachusetts. Addressing
th* Senate on aji amendment to the army
bill, striking out the provision for a vet
erinary corps, he discussed briefly, and
principally In the form of a colloquy with
Senator Haoon of Georgia, the Fnillppine
question and the necessity for an amy of
liXi.000 men. In conclusion he drew a bril
liant word picture of the commercial fu
ture of the United States, declaring that
the trade conflict with Kurope, already be
g-ua, could result only in the commercial
and economical supremacy of this country
over the entire world. In this industrial
conflict he apprehended no dancer from
a material contest with any nation of the
world, but he urged the necessity for a
strong and scientifically organized army
tnd a powerful navy. In order that the
United Slates might be prepared to defend
Ite riiriits against any possible foe.
During the afternoon the Senate ratified
the committee's proposal to eliminate the
section providing for the establishment of
a veterinary Ci>rpa In the army. â¢
Senator Teller of Colorado gave notice
of a substitute he will offer, for the entire
pending measure, continuing in full force
and effect the act of March 3, 1S?9, increas
ing the size of the army for three years
from July 1. 3901.

NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â Winter training
Quarters by the seashore have no charms
for either Ruhlln or Jeffries, heavyweight
pugilists. One day's experience was suf
ficient to convince the big fellows that the
climatic conditions nesr the ocean were
rot conducive to the best possible results
for a tighter preparing for battle. In con
eequence of this decision. Ruhlln. who had
planned to remain at Bath Beach until
ten days before the fight, which Is to take
place in Cincinnati on February 15, has
changed his mind and will leave for Cov
iRSto.n, Kentucky, on Sunday.
Jeffries' experience with the seashore
wind at Loch Arbor to-day convinced htm
that a warmer climate would be more de
sirable and he will move to West Baden,
Indiana, within a few days if the cold
weather continues.
Jeffries arose at 8 o'clock In the morn- j
ing, intending to take his preliminary ex
ercise for battle. A cold, piercing wind
The test case In tha list came from
North Dakota, the title being Fred Hew
itt, plaintiff in error, ve. Emll and Fred
ericka Schultz. The land in question was
settled upon by Howitt In 1&S3, but his
proof of settlement was rejected on the
ground that the land had been withdrawn
m 1873 by the Secretary of the Interior as
within the limits of the Northern Pacific
Indemnity. Tho railroad company then
sold the land to Schultz and his wife and
they entered upon possession of it. Hew
itt Immediately began proceedings to re
cover the land and to-day's decision,
which Is final, was in his favor, reversing
the Supreme Court of Xorth Dakota. The
decision of the court supported the hoM
int of Secretary Vilas, rendered In 1S88,
which decision has since been followed by
the Interior Department.
The court stated that while It was true
that previous to that date the department
had pursued the opposite course, still the
department had consistently held to its
findings since that time. At best, there
fore, Justice Harlan said, the contention
of the railroad people was one of doubt.
Many titles have been acquired, said he.
since Mr. Vllas' opinion was rendered and
the court did not think the Secretary
should be reversed. The opinion added:
"The practice of the Land Department,
if wrong at all, cannot be said to "be so
plainly wrong as to Justify the court after
the lapse of so many years/ In adjudgins
that it had misconstrued the act of Julv
2. 1864, The order of withdrawal by the
Secretary upon which the.tlUe of the rail
road company depends being out of the
Â¦way, there was no- ground to- question the
title of plaintiffs to the land in dispute."
Justice Brewer and Shlras united In a
dissenting opinion.- The decision affects
a large number of land entries.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â In the United
States Supreme Court to-day opinions
were handed down by Justice Harlan In
several cases Involving the Question
whether It was competent for the Secre
tary of the Interior, upon receiving and
approving the map of definite location of
the Northern Pacific road In the States of
North Dakota and Washington, to make
aii order withdrawing odd numbered sec
tions of the lands within the indemnity
limits from settlement.

In the afternoon he took a spin on the
road. Speaking of his health, Jeffries
said that it was all that could be desired
and he was never really bo anxious to
train hard for a battle. He said he
weighed 230 pounds in fighting costume

of his good condition at the present time.

When the caaes of Harry B. CorbÂ«tt,
William Daly and Walter Mclnerney,
known as the "San Jose commisslorr
cases," were called In Judge Megan's
court yesterday, the remittiturs having
been received from the appellate court,
Attorney Coffey, for the prosecution,
asked that bench warrants bo" Issued for
the arrest of the defendants. Corbett said
that the only defendant absent was Daly,
who was In the country, but he guaran
teed that he would be present to-morrow
when the other cases were called. The
defendants would then pay the fines,Im
posed upon them- The Judge accepted
Corbett's word and did not Issue the
bench warrants.-. The same action was
taken in the case of George Duncan,

There is an understanding that In all
the LoWover cases embraced In the stipu
lation between Chief Sullivan and the
poolsellers all the defendants except Zick
Abraxns and his employes will plead guilty
and pay the fine of $10 rather than go to

SAM im/DRETH - started his big
colt Oolden Age in the six furlong
handicap at Oakland yesterday
and. the talent and smart ones In
.general failed to guess the burled
card. The track was muddy and In spots
inclined to be holding, and although Her
moso was asked to pick up 126 pounds,
bookmaker Cook's Bprlnter was consid
ered invincible. The ring nailed up 6 to 5
against him- and the crowd fell .heavily.'
It seems ' that . some . days back llermo*o
whs inclined to show' signs of lameness,
and after he had footed It out in front
with Frank Bell at his heels for over two
thirds of the route he wilted like a frost
bitten calla Illy. Then C?olden Age, with
Kiley on his back, strolled past the two
weary leaders, winning easily , in . 1 :18, '. a
remarkably good race. ' Not' the 112 pounds
on the winner " threw" the talent off, but ;
Kiley. Now, there are far worse riders
than Kiley, but it was generally supposed
Hildreth did not fancy nte horse, and the
price went from 6 to 2 to 4. Frank Bell
outlasted Hermoso, taking tha place.
Tha sport was . replete with surprises
and upsets from the time the curtain
went up.
Of six favorites sent to the post, Beniota'
and^Herculean were the only ones to re
turn with. tha money. Mounce rode In ex
ceptionally good form, piloting three win
ners. Â¦ ' . Â¦
Almost any one of the ten starters in
the first event, a seven furlong selling af
fair, looked to have a chance and there
was no pronounced choice. MacLaren,
with O'Connor up, probably carried the
most support, but sulking ran unplaced
Mounce, on Gusto, rode a well-* judged
race, getting to the wire a couple of
lengths before Spike ana Isaline-/' - Â¦-Â¦
Mounce followed this up by taking the
elx furlong purse run next decided with
Asian from Walter Jenlngs* stable. In
a very close finish at the wire Asian, Hav
iland and Flatterer were heads apart:
Buchanan astride Havlland came up ou
the extreme outside, and many' supposad
that horse had won. Picking finishes,
however, from an angle Is extremely de
ceptive, and the Judges undoubtedly made
no mistake. O'Connor again got away
from the jpost poorly with the favorlto,
Marechal Kiel, running unplaced.
A very pretty piece oi horsemanship
contributed largely to the success of Ber
nota, favorite for the mile and fifty yards
selling event. O'Connor waited with thÂ«
Burns. & VVaterhouse entry until well Into
the Pt retch for home, when he caught
Grafter all out, winning handily. In fact,
the last named three-year-old tired so
badly that Tony Lapping nipped the place
by a head. .
Tenny Belle, ridden by Mounce, captured
the fifth number. At odds of 4 to 1 the
filly beat her company away from the
barrier, and, never headed, disposed of
the 100 to 1 shot, E! Karn, at the end
like sawing wood. O'Connor on the 6 to 6
favorite. Dandy Jim, rode the colt like a
novice. It was supposed to be the chest
nut's going, and his showing is Inexplica
ble.
O'Connor's ride on Herculean In the
closing mile run waa In marked contrast
to the one just mentioned. He lost no
more ground than was necessary, picked
the best going and. Judging his move just
right, beat Wyoming out a head. The
winner closed a 6 to 2 favorite. SvbarU
ran a very fair third.

B. Forbes, George A. Newhall, H. H. Bell
and I. J. Truman sent their regrets at
being unable to attend and excused their
absence on various grounds.
Police Commissioner McNutt read a pa
per on the subject under discussion. He
held that the evil must be dealt with in a
moro. business-like manner than it has
been dealt with ln the past. He was op
posed to the proposition of licensing
houses of ill repute and was of the opinion
that the objectionable classes should be
kept within certain territory within the
city, but not under the shadow of
churches and schools.
The Rev. Dr. Campbell said that, the
great waves of morality periodically
sweep over great cities, but generally fall
to purify,, because those leading the re
form movement do not act with common
sense. "You cannot eradicate the social
evil by legislation," said he, "any more
than you can legislate people Into so
briety."
Secretary C. L. Moore read letters from
Eastern cities showing that the authori
ties found it wisest to tolerate the evil
under certain regulations.
I3ador Jacobs, president of the Califor
nia Canneries: C. K. Alpers and Paul A.
Veucelions, who followed, spoke in favor
of restricting the social plague spot of the
city to some place where there is but lit
tle travel after nightfall.
Rev. Dr. Henry R. Fisk said that he
was not ln favor of concentration of the
objectionable class in any portion of the
municipality. He believed that there
should be arrests and imprisonment of all
offenders against the moral laws.
The Rev. Dr. William H. Rader said

Petty Larcsny.
Two well-dressed young women giving
their names as Florence Cuslck and Anna
Scott were arrested yesterday ln Halo
Bros.' store, on Market street and charged
with stealing two toothbrushes which
were found in their possession. The
women had cone to the store, and after
making several purchases, one of them.
Jokingly, so they claim, picked up a tooth
brush from the counter and placed it in
her pocket. Not to be outdone ln what
she thought was a joke, the other also
possessed herself of a toothbrush. Special
Officer Greene saw them take the brushes
and he placed them under arrest. Amid
tears and pleadings they were forced to
accompany the officer to the City Prison,
where they were booked for petty lar
ceny. A short time afterward they were
released on $50 cash bail each. .

the Supervisors to take immediate action
on the matter of restricting the height of

that the social evil was a festering sore
on the body politic. He believed ln re

"I believe In confining the objectionable

officer in accordance with an arrangement
a detective had made with. Contractor
Hobson, who pave the money to King
shortly before his arrest. The history of
the bribery, overtures for which were
made by King, according to Hobson, Is
described by the contractor ln an Inter
view as follows:
"In June last I received a contract for
the erection of barracks at Fort Morgan,
Alabama. I began work at once, and as
eoon as the building became in course of
erection King began condemning the ma
terial used. When I went to Mobile King
etated he wanted to make JJOOO out of the
contract. King met me ln Mobile yester
day and told me he needed $1000. I in
formed an agent of the fact, and $1000 ln
marked money was placed ln the bank, l
drew the money this afternoon and by
appointment met Captain King ln my
room at the hotel. The money was paid
over to him, and he Informed me he
thought there would be no trouble. He
walked down stairs and was placed un
der arrest by a Government agent walt
lr.g for him."

With the exception of the Quay contest the most
generally interesting struggle of the winter will be
the fight in 'Illinois for the seat now occupied by
Senator Cullom. Ex-Governor Tanner, Representa
tive Cannon and Representative Hitt are aspirants for
the place," ?.nd of course Cullom desires re-election.
It is asserted that Tanner has entered the field solely
to defeat Cullom. and will throw his strength to either
The States in which there will be contests of greater
or less interest are Deiaware, Colorado, Illinois, Kan
sas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Utah. The contests
in Delaware and Pennsylvania have been before the
country for a long time. They are the outcome of
bygone deadlocks, and may be accounted as parts of
the unfinished business of the last century. That of
Addicks in Delaware is of but little interest to the
country at large, but in Pennsylvania, where Quay
is making a fight for victory or political death, the
contest attracts attention throughout the Union, for.
whatever be his faults, Quay is a leader of national
reputation and influence and many large interests are
bound up with his fortunes.
In several States the elections are foregone con
clusions. Hoar of Massachusetts, Frye of Maine,
Berry of Arkansas, McMillan of Michigan, Sewell of
New Jersey, McBride of Oregon, Elkins of West Vir
ginia and Warren of Wyoming are sure of re-election.
Two Populist Senators â Pettigrew of North Dakota
and Butler of North Carolina â will have to go, the
one giving place to a Republican, the other to a
Democrat.
In a good many States the successors to the in
cumbents whose terms will expire on March 4 have
been already elected. Wetmore of Rhode Island,
Bacon of Georgia, Morgan of Alabama and Tillman
of South Carolina have been re-elected. Bailey of
Texas is to follow Chilton, Blackburn of Kentucky is
to succeed Lindsay, Foster takes the place of Caffery
of Louisiana, Sullivan of Mississippi gives way to Mc-
Laurin, Virginia some time ago returned Senator
Martin, and Vermont has chosen a Senator for the
unexpired term of Senator Morrill.
SENATORIAL ELECTIONS
f* ALIFORNIA fortunately has no United States
( Senator to elect this winter, and therefore can
watch the struggles elsewhere without being
tormented by troubles of her own. There is to be a
larger number of Senators elected this winter than
ever before in the history of the Senate. Owing to
the death of Senators or to deadlocks several States
have two Senators to elect, and in some of them there
are already signs portentous of deadlocks to come.
That changes in journalism will come with the cen
tury is not to be doubted. Nothing remains long
unchanged in this world. Even in book publishing
the old folios of the past have given place to the handy
octavos and duodecimos' t>f our time, and the future
will see further alterations of form and style. Mr.
Harmsworth's New Year edition of the World is
something in the nature of a prediction of the course
the coming change will take, but, like all other New
Year predictions, it is but an individual's^ guess. The
journalism of the future, as of the past, will be de
termined by the slow evolution of public opinion, and
if we are ever to have tabloid journalism the time of
its coming is a long way off. .
The point aimed at by the editor was that of pro
viding a paper that can be easily read and conve
niently carried. The claim was made that by glancing
over the thirty-two pages of which the I paper was
composed the busy man could get a summary of the
news of the world in sixty seconds. Such being the
aim, it seems that Harmsworth missed his mark.
Tabloid journalism does not show the news as quickly
as the wide page of the present form of paper.
HARMSWORTH'S ideal of what a twentieth
century newspaper should be, presented in the
form of a New Year's edition of the New York
World, has reached this side of the continent. The
most striking novelty of the venture is the change in
size of the pages of the paper. Instead of the ap
proximately square sheet to which newspaper readers
are accustomed, the Harmsworth paper is but four
columns wide, while its length is quite three times the
width. To this form of paper Harmsworth has given
the name "tabloid journalism," and the name fits well,
for one looks about as queer as the other sounds.
HARMSWORTH'S IDEAL PAPER.
HORSE LATITUDE-G. T. R., Hay
wards. Cal. Horse latitude Is a name
given by sailors to a belt of calm in the
Atlantic extendlni?. usually, from about 30
to 35, north latitude, where sailing ves
sels are often delayed for days for want
of wind. Many years ago a large num
ber of . horses and mules were shipped
from the United States to the West Indies
in exchange for sugar, rum and other
products of the islands. The vessels ran
short of water for th* animals in thi3
belt and many died. ThÂ« carcasses were
thrown overboard and sailors In vessels
that passed later on, seeing the carcasses
floating, applied the terra to that latlud.

been melted up for the purpose and la

A CHANCE TO SMILR
It is the business of wise men to weigh present acts
in view of the future effect, and the members will be
-wise if they look into the faces of the* people for ap
proval and guidance.
The voters of California are independent. They re
quire good sen-ice and do not scruple to turn a
minority into a majority in order to get it The next
Legislature will elect a Senator, and it is not strain
ing a point to say that that choice will be determined
by what this Legislature does.
Let every member look ahead to the next election,
when the work of the Â«ession will go to judgment be
fore the people.
There are trained men in the Legislature. Ths
executive has had two years' contact with the whole
State and time to study its needs. All the knowledge
gained and experience acquired belong to the people,
and we will rejoice to see them made ttfe beneficiaries.
We hope that this Legislature, with its heavy Re
publican majority, will see that questions of political
patronage and merely personal politics are among the
least of its concerns, and that the people who transact
each day's business, and who toil for returns in field,
orchard, vineyard, forest, mine and mill, have business
that is the real affair to be regarded.
The session is young. Before it is much older much
work will appear that it can do in the interest of ths
State. The widely diversified industries and the g~eat
variety of production in California make the passage
and administration of law more important here than
ir>. any other State of the Union. The problems of
irrigation and the conservation of water for mining
and the fostering of sgriculture and horticulture are
touched on all sides by the law. We are yet in the
early stage of the State's development, and Legisla
tures have upon them the solemn and inspiring re
sponsibility of cutting the statutory garments of this
beautiful commonwealth so that its symmetry may not
be marred.
It is the duty of a party paper to be watchful of the
opposition and expose and rebuke its lapses and its
errors. To give effect to this policy it must deprecate
ir. its own party that which it exposes in the opposi
tion. This The Call does not hesitate to do, for it
wishes to stand for things of good report, and to use
its position honestly and fairly.
THE CALL ur^ed what it beHeved to be
proper action upon the Republicans in the
House. They have made a mistake, not because
they went counter to our views, but because they ac
cepted a leadership outside their official body anÂ«l
conferred upon Martin Kelly power without respon
sibility. To secure good government power and re
sponsibility should go together. Apparently what has
been done separates them. Kelly h^s the power and
the House and the Republican party have the respon
sibility. As we had no candidate we feel no sense of
defeat in the result. Many things are possible, and
it is possible that the session may be free from scan
dal, and when its record is written much good will
have been accomplished by it. As far as is proper in
a newspaper we will cordially co-operate to such an
end. Whatever credit is due to the legislative body,
or to any of its individual members, will be cheer
fully accorded by The Call. At the same time we
abate none of the watchfulness which a newspaper
owes to the community and a party paper to its party.
Upon possession of proof of wrong we will not hesi
tate to expose it, hit whom it may.
THE SPEflKERSHlP.
BY special arrangement with George
F. Cram of Chicago and New York,
Atlas publisher. The Call has ob
tained the exclusive right to handle
Cram's Atlas of the world. 1901 edi
tion,^ on the Pacific Coast, and la offering
the splendid work to Call subscribers for
the actual cost of 'delivery and transpor
tatlon. Every office, home and workshop
should be provided with this splendid
woik. Now Is your chance to get the best
Atlas published on the best terms ever
offered. Remember the Atlas is down to
date, contains all the 1900 census, statis
tics, etc., and will be ready for delivery
about March 1. 1901.
Xo reference work is of more import
ance In the educational departments of
life, the home, the office and the library,
than a good Atlas, carefully edited. It
should be large enough to embrace all de
tails of importance, not unwieldy, clear
in coloring, printing and lettering, and.
above all, conveying the latest Informa
tion with completeness and accuracy.
Cram's Superior Atlas of the "World is
designed to provide 'a complete atlas of
the world, containing a uniform series of
maps of all countries, on a scale that will
be valuable alike for library, educational
and practical uses. The peculiar feature
of this work Is its universal scope, cover
ing as it does, the entire known world.
The numerous diagrams and tables pre
sent a vast amount of statistical Informa
tion taken from, the very latest official
sources. This Interesting feature will ma
terially aid all who will have occasion to
refer to them, in keeping in touch with
the constant changes that are occurring
in the political, financial, commercial and
religious world.
(1 50 in cash and six months' subscrip
tion to The Dally Call will entitle you to
this splendid book of reference.
One feature of the Atlas mig-ht justly Je
styled, "An Encyclopedia of History and
Geography," as In condensed space It
gives briefly: The area, population, physi
cal features, government, religion, educa
tion, army and navy defenses, Industries,
climate, etc., of every State, Territory and
foreign country, of the world.
One hundred and seventy maps convey
a clear understanding and correct knowl
edge of every* portion of the earth's sur
face. They have been recently drawn and
newly engraved from the records of tha
topographical department at Washington
and from the charts of the Royal Geo
graphical Society of London. Specially
interesting: are the maps of New Alaska.
Africa. Cuba, Oklahoma, the Hawaiian
group, the colonies of the new Australian
commonwealth and the Islands of the
seas. In addition there are forty-six maps
and plans of the principal cities of the
world.
The Call has obtained the exclusive right of hand
ling this superb work on the Pacific Coast, and offers
it to subscribers for the cost of delivery and transpor
tation. Every one who subscribes for The Call for
six months is entitled to obtain the atlas for $1.50.
It will be ready for delivery about March 1.
Copies of the work have been submitted to leading
educational authorities and they unite in cordially
commending it. President Wheeler of the State Uni
versity says: "I consider that the opening up of such
opportunities as this work represents for the educa
tion and information of the masses of the people is a
public service." President Jordan says: "It seems to
me to be a most valuable work of reference, giving in
compact andaccessible form a mass of vital informa
tion. The work seems well brought up to date. 1
was particularly struck with the completeness of daU
in the map of China." Thomas J. Kirk, Superinten
dent of Public Instruction, says: "The name of Cram
as the publisher at once predisposed me in its favor,
and my expectations were fully met as I turned the
leaves and noticed the fine maps, comprehensive tables
of statistics and the valuable and readable reports
upon almost every conceivable subject."
The value of an atlas depends upon the man who
makes it. It is easy to draw maps carelessly, but it
is not easy to prepare one that is accurate and true
in every detail. Recognizing that truth, The Call has
arranged to obtain an atlas compiled by one of the
foremost publishers of such works in the world, and
offers to its readers the "Superior" edition of the 1901
Geographical and Historical Atlas, published by
George F. Cram. The work contains 550 pages and
includes a complete series of maps of modern geog
raphy, a chronological outline of American history^
a concise account of the political history of the United
States, an accurate compilation of statistics from the
latest United States census reports, a complete ga
zetteer of cities, towns and villages with their popu
lations by the latest census, and, finally, special maps
of Alaska, Cuba, Hawaii and the Philippines.
1 â I OR a clear, understanding of the current news
I of the world there is necessary* to every reader a
comprehensive atlas for ready reference in order
that the exact location of every point made important
in the dispatches of the day may be easily learned.
It is true The Call publishes from time to time maps
of localities in which wars are going on, or other
notable events occur, but such maps are not sufficient
for the full needs of readers. TTiey do not appear
in the paper every day, arid yet ' reference to a map is
often a matter of daily need. To supply that re
quirement of those who wish to follow the world's
news intelligently, The Call has arranged to furnish
its readers with a complete geographical and historical
atlas containing an accurate compilation of facts and
statistics brought down to the beginning of the cen
tury.

It seems that the qniet comment of the

From Nebraska comes the curious report that Sena
tor Thurston, who not -long ago announced that he'
would not be a candidate for re-election, has changed
his mind and is now making a fight for what he said
he would not accept as a gift. In Minnesota Senator
Nelson will be re-elected, but there will be a lively
contest for the vacancy caused by the death of Senator
Davis. It is also quite possible that interesting fights
niay be developed in Colorado and Montana, for in,
the latter State there are two Senators to be elected,
and the State is notorious for Senatorial sensations.

Out of the various contests there are very sure to
develop some of those prolonged deadlocks and scan
dals which have disgusted the country with our pres
ent system of electing Senators. It is quite likely,
therefore, that, we shall have this winter a new and
augmented demand for the election of Senators by
direct vote of the people.
There are indications that this republic is ready
to set the example. Our high-minded policy in China,
contrasted with the high-handed policy of others, is
a cheerful sign. On that far field spark and tinder
have been dangerously associated for months. It has
sometimes seemed sure that they would ignite a world
warfare, involving Europe and Asia in a more "san
guinary struggle than the world has seen. But,
thanks to the sense of humanity and 'equity at Wash
ington, the crisis seems to be passing, and the inter
ests of peace will be much advanced when it finally
disappears.
The Cardinal is too optimistic and kind to his own
times in one respect There is not much evidence to
support his claim that war is more humane than of
old. It is true armies care better for their wounded,
and enemies in battle are equally served in the same
hospital and by the same surgeon. But in Egypt, in
South Africa, in our cwn stormy possessions and in
China, the armies of Christian nations have charged
against them offenses against humanity that rank with
any which are recorded in history. Let the stain be
removed by return to the ways of peace.
Civilization should have better work to do than
training men to kill each other. .Perhaps in a few
years the world may advance so far that a peace con
ference may meet, deliberate and not be as barren
of results as the last
The pulpits of all the Christian sects have spoken
for peace. Cardinal Gibbons has spoken for his
church in very impressive language and has suggested
much that may well be studied by his countrymen.
His picture of a nation so devoted to order and law
that the mailed hand is unseen in its affairs, and a
l?xge army is not needed in its administration, is one
that must impress the hopeful and thoughtful Ameri
can.
Indeed the country may well begin now to encour
age the dove of peace to return and nest among us.
We are glad to read in the many sermons that have
been preached in this country on the meeting and th*
parting of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a
reappearance of the spirit of peace on earth and good
will toward men.
We have never seen any explanation, psychological
ci otherwise, of the existence of a .war spirit among
the clergy. But it is among them. It flashed up
vividly before our Civil War, North and South, and
when the struggle came Bishops put by their shep
herd's crook and took up the sword to fight
Perhaps this tendency, which seems unnatural in
women, is natural after all. Women admire strength,
courage and adventure in men, and fear that in long
maintained peace these qualities may decline and get
stale. So they are impelled by the constitution of
their sex to urge a revival in the hard school of war.
IT was discouraging before the outbreak of our war
with Spain, and also preceding the British attack
on the Transvaal, that so many clerical voices wers
raised for war and so many churches were made to
ring with excited and exciting appeals to the war
spirit In both countries it was noticed as a remark
able condition that ministers of the gospel and women
were prominent in urging war. No one has ever ac
counted for the enthusiasm for war that has been fre
quently shown by women. They cannot feel the rap
ture of the fight They cannot take part in camp and
march, and feel the shock of battle. They are liable
to lose their protectors, their sons, their .friends. The
hard consequences of war fall heavily upon them.
Yet on occasion they sre foremost in urging carnage.
It will be remembered that when President McKinley
seemed about to get for Cuba by diplomacy all thai
war finally secured the students of a young ladies'
scniinary in New York wired him that coarse and
savage telegram, "To hell with diplomacy."

XXVmâ HOW TO MEASURE SPE
CIFIC GRAVITY.
The specific gravity of any substance is
the ratio of the weight r>f any volume of
that substanco to the weight of an equal
volume of water.
By the absolute density (or simply the
density) of a substance we mean the mass
of unit volume of It: for example, the
number of pounds In a cubic foot of It.
By relative density we mean the ratio of
its density to that of some standard sub
stance, or its heaviness as compared with
the standard substance, bulk for bulk.
"When water 1* taken as the standard
substance, relative density is usually
called specific gravity; so that the spe
cific gravity of a substance means the
weight of any volume of It divided by the
weight of an equal volume of water. Ab
solute density is, of course, equal to rela
tive density multiplied by the density of
the standard substance.
The most convenient units for dealing
with densities are the cubic foot and the
ounce, because a cubic foot of water may
be taken as weighing 1000 ounces, this be
ing only about 1& ounces in excess of the
truth. Hence when we express densities
in ounces per cubic foot, the density of
water may be called 1000 and the density
of any other substance will be 1000 times
its specific gravity. If we express densi
ties in pounds rer cubic foot the multiplier
will be 624.
The density of a substance can be di
rectly determined by weighing a meas
ured volume of it. This method can be
easily applied to solids of rectangular
form, since their volume can be computed
by multiplying together their length,
breadth and thickness. It can also be ap
plied to liquids by employing a vessel of
known content. The vessel usually em
ployed for this purpose is a bottle of thin
glass, fitted with a perforated stopper, so
that it can be filled and stoppered without
leaving a space for air. The difference
between its weights when full and empty
is the weight of the liquid which fills It.
and the quotient of this by the volume
occupied (which can be found by weigh
ing the bottle, when filled with water> Is
the density of the liquid.
The volume and density of a solid body
of irregular shape, or consisting of a
quantity of small pieces, can be deter
mined by putting it into such a bottle
and weighing the water which It dis
places. The most convenient way of do
ing this is to observe (1) the weight of
the solid; (2) the weight of the bottle full
of water; (3) the weight of the bottle
when it contains the solid, together with
as much water as will fill it up. If the
third of these results be abstracted from
the sum of the first two. the remainder
will be the weight of the water displaced;
which, when expressed in grams, is tho
same as the volume of tho body ex
pressed in centimeters. The weight of
the body, divided by that of the water
displaced. Is the density of the body.
From the fact that a cubio foot of water
weighs 1000 ounces (62}i pounds) we can
find the weight of any quantity of water
If we know its volume.
Instead of measuring the actual densi
ties of substances it is more convenient
to compare the weights of equal volumes
of different substances, and for this pur
pose one particular substance is always
chosen as the standard wjth which all
others are compared.
Tho standard substance universally
adopted (except in comparing certain
gases) is water at a temperature of 3D
degrees Fahrenheit (its point of maximum
density).
Thus the weight of a cubic foot of sea
and fresh water are 1021 and 1000 ounces,
respectively, and their ratio Is equal to
1021. This ratio is called the specific grav
ity of sea water. Again, the specific grav
ity of mercury is about 13.6. This Implies
that a cubic foot of mercury weighs 13.6
Ume3 as much as a cubic foot of water.

Central.
The melodrama "Woman and Wine"
was presented at the Central Theater last
night to a well filled house. It Is full of
exciting scenes, including a duel to tho
death with knives between two women.
Marcelle Rigadout, a French adventuress,
believing that Richard Seymour, son of
Hugh Seymour, a blind artist, is heir to a
large fortune, Induces him to forsake his
father and fly with her to Paria, where
she soon tires of him. He stakes bis for
tune on his horse, but the woman bribes
the Jockey and the horse loses the race.
The adventuress gets another lover arid
his mistress kills her in a duel with
knives. Seymour, who happens to fall
asleep under the Influence of drugs at the
scene of the duel, is arrested and tried
for murder. He is convicted, but as the
Judge is about to pass sentence the mur
deress confesses in open court and the
curtain falls. Howard Hall as Richard
Seymour played with his usual force and
success, and Miss Effle Darling played
the adventuress so well that she was
hissed by the "gods." Miron Lefflngwell

In* l?v' e ti h Â£ s been strengthened
and Nell of Old Drury" is portrayed ln
?,? e Â» of , her tral *s which history recordsâ
that of a passionate and loving woman,
it is not to be wondered at that plays con
cerning Nell Gwynne should be fascinat
ing and of heart interest. The Alcazar
has a play free from crudity; historical ln
its plot, merry ln its natural comedy and
above all possessing that quality which
mingles tears and laughter and makes the
auditor realize that the stage truly "holds
the mirror up to nature." It is well worth
a trip to the Alcazar to witness the ar
tistic work of Florence Roberts and her
talented associates. On Thursday after
noon a "professional matinee" will be
given of '\Xell Gwynne."
Orpheum.
Shows may come and shows may go;
there may be lighthouses on the eea and
light houses that pain actors to see, but
the Orpheum. like a really happy man. Is
full forever and always. The management
seems to be able to hit the public under
the belt all the time. There was a big
house last night and a fine bill. Bettlna
Gerard, the celebrated opera star, made
wfii Â£ n ap P ea . rance ln vaudeville; the
}\illy Collinls in acrobatic dancing, the
llawthornes in songs, the Crosby and
Fprman Company In a sketch, the five
Ulracs, tho bosses of burlesque acrobat* â¢
Davles, the Irishman; Joe Santley, the boy
Koprano, and Shean and Warren form a
combination hard to equal.
Tivoli.
At the Tivoll "Cinderella" is in its fourth
week and its popularity does not seem to
wane In the least. The gorgeous ballet
and general brilliancy of the production
make it a feast for the eyes and the clever
people in^the cast furnish all sorts of fun
Ferris Hartxnan has a long string of new
jQkes that produce roars of laughter.
Alhambra,
"Jed Prouty" entertained a full house
at the Alhambra last evening. From the
beginning to the end the quaint New Eng
land drama went smoothly and the innate
pathos and horse-playWun were equally
successful in moving the audience.
Fischer's Concert House,
"With one exception every act on the
programme at Fischer"s Concert-house
was new last night. Oro, Bernard and
Oro were amusing in "Scenes In China
town": Xell Montgomery proved to be a
phenomenal child contralto, and the RuÂ«
pell brothers gave a clever aerial exhibi
tion. Antonio and Conchita Martinez are
graceful Spanish dancers. Mile. Atlantis
gives a pretty dance. K!d Baxter's aer'nl
juggling act is marvelous, while Marie D.
Wood, the "California Nightingale," is a3
popular as ever;
The Henschel Becitals.
The opening yesterday of the sale of
season tickets for the Ilenschel recitals,
to take place next month at Metropolitan
Temple, indicates a series of crowded
houses for these talented exponents of
song. The singers are making a farewell
tour of America and will not return here
for some years.
Olympia.
Ouhama, the Juggler, is the chief at
traction at .the Olympla this week. There
are other good numbers, however, and on
the whole, the new bill is far above the
average. Mabel Hudson made quite a hit
last nieht and the Dulcie Sisters were well
received.
1. The area of any plane rectilinear
figure such as is shown below can be
found by dividing it Into triangles as by
the dotted lines, and then finding the
area of all the triangles and adding them
.together.
"Human Hearts," presented last night
at the California Theater by a good com
pany, pretends to be nothing but a sim
ply <yet neatly) constructed melodrama,
depending for but little of Its interest on
the story. The resolution of that is easily
foreseen some time before the close of the
first act. when the tramp in hiding sees
the villain commit the murder that shall
bring him to grief. Having thus given
the audience assurance that in the fourth
act all will be we.l, the author proceeds
to elaborate a second and third act that
contain some excel ent character sketches
and some truly diverting episodes.
Prominent among the characters stands
that of the good-htarted tramp, v, ho. like
the irreat O. P. Pym in "Tommy and
Grlzelle " puffers constitutionally from an
acute disinclination to work: the sight of
a saw terrifies him and the sudden men
tion -of fried chicken causes a break
down of his nervous system. This Is a
rich and racy American type; I think the
author, Mr. Hal T.eli. has drawn it ex
cellently and I am sure it was excellently
played â not burlesqued â by Mr. E. A. Mc-
Hukh. Other good types, quickly and
pleasurably recognized, are that of the
newsboy (Miss Ketchem) and of the coun
try blacksmith (Mr. Fairbanks). With
his villain (Mr. Guard) and his vlllalness
(Miss Bennett) the author has. I think.

CHICAGO, Jan. 7.â It was evident from the
opening price In wheat that opinion as to the
future course of the market varies greatly.
Initial prices for May, which closed Saturday
at 79Vi<S79%c, ranged from 79c to 79^0. For a
time the volume of business was tremendous.
Immense buying orders, many from the outside,
were in the hands of brokers, but local longs,
with big profits In prevailing prices, were more
than willing to sell, and j from the start the
tendency was downward. The crowd appar
ently believed that Wall street influences were
at work and big commission houses were closely
watched. Soon after the opening a marked ele
ment of weakness developed from the liberal
receipts and the weakness of the Northwest
markets, but the appearance of any large buy
ing or selling orders In the hands of a prom
inent broker seemed to have more effect on the
crowd than any statistical news. May closed
at 78c, the low point of the day, with the mar
ket exhibiting considerable nervousness.
The world's shipments last week were only
5.8S2.000 bushels. The visible supply decreased
163,000 bushels.
Light receipts, poor grading returns, unset
tled weather and light country acceptances
made the market for corn independently strong
May closed >ie higher. ,
Oats were fairly active and at times the mar
ket showed real strength. . May closed >4c
higher.
Provisions were fairly active and irregular
Sharp advances were scored at the opening)
the firmness of yard prices causing good general
buying. Reactions followed quickly, pork es
pecially suffering from liquidation by the real
operators. The close was Irregular. May pork
closed lCc lower. May lard unchanged and May

it SS points over Saturday's level. During the
rest oi the day it was simply a question where
the new points of strength would develop.
With the appearance of anything like a buil
leadership in a given stock, or with the first
cigr. of manipulation lor an advance, perfect
hurCee of siiecu Inters were ready to ruEb pell-,
mel! to buy the eame stock. None of these
advances was well held, and the professional
pjof.t-taking cost them all the way from 2
to nearly 7 points. But even at that reaction
many handsome net {rains were conserved for
ihe day. The grangers were foremost In yie
miciaay advance, the three leading members of
the groupâ Burlir.gton. Rock Island and St Paul
â advancing C&6V Later in the day the an
thracite coalero. which have not hitherto move** 1
largely in sympathy with the Reading. New

Tennessee Coal showed weakness on the fail
ure of the directors to deci&re the dividend,
and :t fell an extreme CT* points, closing on'y
a fraction above that. The steel stocks were
Inclined to heaviness in eympathy, except Tin
plate, which was advanced 1\. The rubber
etwks were Inclined to weakness, but had a
pood rally. Northern Pacific moved up 4%
after its sharp openir.g decline, and People's
Gas had a midday rite of 4Vi. The list of
stocks which rose as much as 3 points and a
fraction i* a long one, and the stocks which
'.:Â¦'. not fluctuate as much as a point or over
were very few. It was evident that the rul
ing cause of the speculation was* the recent
drvMopment* in the railroad world looking
toward va*t consolidation. The acquisition of
the Pennsylvania Coal Company by the Erie
end of thÂ» Central Itailroad Company of New
Jf rfccy by the Reading is regarded In the specu
lative world z.r a prelude to further Important
developments in the anthracite carrying prop
erties. a?iÂ«i ready credence is given to almost
eny miggeetlon of a plan for railroad consoli
dation. Honey also is working easier In epltc
cf the enrrmous demands of the speculation.
The rather gloomy condition of foreign mar
ketn. Instead of having any depressing effect,
t^ems to stimulate speculative activity here
by the strong contraui of this country's pros
perity. The day's record of business was car
ried far beyond the previous high level, the
arrregate bales footing up 2.147.000 share*,
compared with 1,8X7.900 shares on last Friday
Trhirh made the record up to that time. Sales
of individual Etoek* to-day included 132,600
Aim of Sugar. Si.000 chares of Baltimore and
Ohio. 121.000 shares of Burlington, 1S9.000 ehares
of Krie. 132,000 sharr* of Northern Pacific, 137.

NEW TORK. Jan. 7.â To-day's stock market
had all the characteristics of what Is usually
called a traders' n:arket. But everything was or
a Eis^r.iic scale. Where 1J0 shares would be a
rormal ui it in an ordinary market, in to-day's
market -C"0 and even WXI share lots were
bandied about like playthings for a quick turn.
Tlit movement cf prices was en a coirespond
ir.gly gieantic scale. The turn over of profits
In tome caees on these enormous blocks cf
stocks was made within a few minutes of time,
prices having varied In the Interval perhaps
many points. The speculative character of the
n;.irket was clear!}* indicated in the inconsist
ency cf prices. Not only was nothing stable
for any considerable period, but no movement
was consistent beyond a short length of time.
LoFses were recovered, gains were loet anJ
there were Etrons rallies from reactions. All
this rr-atie the utmost excitement and confu
fcion 1a the market all day long. It was nat
ural to expect aftÂ«?r the excessive and artificial
advances cf the closing trading of last week
that Fpeculators would be In a condition of
anxiety to s>kinÂ» the cream of the profits this
ruornirig. This class wa>. in fact, on hand
in fuil force, and the eagerness with which

NEW YORK. Jan. 7.â It was a day of small
things In the market for metals to-day. Specu
lation was almost entirely lacking, but the un
dertone was steady on firm reports from abroad,
where prices advanced about Â£2 for- tin on
good demand. Closed firm at Â£120 15s 6d. The
local market for. that metal was quoted firm in

CLOSING.
The December trade returns ehow that ex
ports increased 7 per cent and the imports 10
per cent, mainly In foodstuffs and raw cotton.
The figures for the year show exports up 10
per cent. Imports 8 per cent.
Americans were quicker and sellers predom
inated. The perpetual reports of consolidations
are regarded as a mischievous development
wh.ch ' may bring about serious trouble later
on. This was a "Reading day" prominently.
An early morning "tip" to buy shares of that
company on the New Jersey Central deal was
accepted enthusiastically, and the fluctuations
were violent. Baltimore nnd.Ohlo also boomed
the dividend rumors. The general market,
however, eased off. then broke on free sales
by New York. There was a partial rally In
the 6treet. The market has now repaid the
bank ail its loans, but the latter still holds a
heavy amount of bills. Bar gold recovered to
70s 10%d.
A fair amount of business was done in the
markets here to-day, but the tone was not
satisfactory. An adverse Influence was a
series of reports exaggerating the losses In
South Africa Into the defeat and death of Gen
eral Knox.

Bangor. Me., has succeeded In breaking
the codicil to the will of his uncle. Ed
mund Hlndman, whereby he was deprived
of over J20.000.
Judge Greene decided against the con

that of undue influence, tut sustained the
contention of the nephew s attorneys that
the codicil was not legally executed, and
that the witnesses did not sign in the
presence of each. other. It also appeared
that they did not know what they were
signing.
The contest has occupied several months
and has been fought with great determin

latter made no effort at rejoinder and con

The California State Conference o?
Charities came to a successful close this
evening after a session covering four
days, during which there were ten subor
dinate sessions held ana twice as many
subjects discussed. Much good is certain
to follow the light thrown on the Inner
machinery of educational and philan
thropic works by the earnest talk of the
many interested men and women who at
tended the conference. Renewed interest
will be taken in the branches of these two
institutions which are of such vital Im
portance to the State and the mental and
physical well being and happiness will
be promoted as a result. Great confidence
is felt now that two bills" advocated l>y
the conference will pass '.he Legislature,
as the publicity given the sessions has
shown what strength there is behind
them. One of these bills Is for a State
board of control for charities and one is
for compulsory education.
The morning session to-day was given
over to the subject of "California's Care
for the Feeble-Minded." D. Edward Col
lins, as the chairman, first calleu upon
Dr. A. E. Osborne of the State Home for
the Feeble-Minded at Eldridge, Sonoma
County, to speak upon that institution.
Dr. Osborne described the early struggle
of the institution to secure a suitable
home, and how It had wandered from
place to place until It had finally landed
at its present location. But now the man
agers of ;ihe home are perfectly pleased
with it and generous support permits all
the modern improvements.
California. Dr. Osborne said, was the
first State to abolish the age limit with
Its attendant inconveniences. Nearly all
the Eastern States have .followed the ex
ample set by California. . Another Initia
tory improvement made In this State was
to provide for the care of epileptics. In-
Ftead of being denied admission to the
State's hospitals, which was formerly the
case, these afflicted persons are now re
ceived.
Dr. Osborne 18 a strong advocate of thÂ«?
"home" system of caring for patients.
This plan contemplates giving a cottago
to the patient or several Datients, over
which they are expected to exercise scru-
Fiulous care. The inmates, besides caring
or the Interior, are exoected to ra'.se
poultry and farm produce which, being
sold, makes them self-supporting. The
plan removes. the onpresslve character of
an institutional home.
Dr. Hatch. Superintendent of State
Hospitals, delivered an address upon the
history and development of the institu
tions under his supervision. He quoted
statistics to show tbat insanity Â¦ was on

Pending the hearing of his former wife's
action against him for ! battery, "Copper
King" George W. Hull has come back at
the lady with a complaint, asking that
her claim to the homestead in Berkeley
be annulled by- the court.. The complaint
cites the findings of an Arizona court to
the effect that Margaret J^ Lowell, alias
Margaret J. Hull, was guilty of polygamy
in wedding the capitalist, and that the
latter was tricked into the marriage by
her representations that she was a single
woman.
The comptaint continues that while un
der this false Impression, and regarding
the defendant as his lawful wife. Hull
filed a homestead claim of his Berkeley
residence, giving his supposed wife Joint
ownership In the property. This home
stead Hull now asks the court to annul
on the ground that it was obtained by
fraud.
In the story of the marriage given as
ground for the complaint Hull says tfoÂ£t
he took the defendant for his wife at
Phoenix, Aria., in November of 1897, the
latter assurlrig him that she was free
from all matrimonial entanglements. It
was In June of last year that the couple
came to Berkeley, where Hull bought the
property in dispute. In September of the
same year, he says, he found, that his
companion was in reality the lawful wife
of one Sylvester M. Lowell of Phoenix,
whereupon he immediately commenced
suit in Arizona to have his marriage an
nulled. A decree to that effect was issued
on the 29th of last December.
The homestead deed, however, was still
in force, and Mrs. Lowell, -as the court
has decided she should be called, contin
ued in possession of the Berkeley prem
ises. It was there that the trouble oc
curred for which she has had Hull arrest
ed for battery.
The capitalist will be arraigned on the
battery charge to-morrow at 10 o'clock In
Justice Qulnn's court. ,

for a system of parole by which dis

that they would be returned to the insti
tution if their malady reasserted itself.
Hon. \V. R. Davis presided at the first
afternoon session, when the care of or
phaned children was under discussion. Al
bert A. Elliott interpreted the laws gov
erning orphans, their parents, foster par
ents and guardians. He advocated amend
ing the statutes so that good people who
contemplate adopting children would not
be compelled to make them equal helrs
at-law with their own offspring. This
was the main reason why more children
were not adopted. Miss Katherlne n Felton
pleaded for an organized head for orphan
institutions. Rev. Father Crowley of the
Youths' Directory, who was to have made
an address, was unable to be present on
account of sickness.
The latter half of the afternoon was
taken up with a discussion of social set
tlements. Mrs. F. C. Turner presiding. Dr.
Dorothea Moore, Miss Colburn and A. W.
Palmer told of the good accomplished in
the social settlements they had been In

evening, session, whon co-operation be
tween public and private charities was
dlscusped. Mrs. Pauline Dohrmann, dele
prate from the Associated Charities of
Stockton, read a pnper givlnjr an exposi
tion of the charitable work that Is being
carried on in San Joaquin County. She
gave some complete and Interesting sta
tistics concerning the 570 people of her
county who applied for aid during the
year 1900. She emphasized the fact that
Indiscriminate alms-giving was one of the
principal causes of pauperism.
Miss Jessica Peixotto explained the plan
in vogue in Liverpool and Denver for col
lecting and distributing, through an in
corporated body, the moneys for the suc
cor of the Indiecnts of those cities.
A resolution was Introduced by Osgood
Putnam and unanimously passed in which
the State executive and the State legls
lators'are urged to enact the bill creating
a State Board of Charities and Correc
tions, with powers of supervision and re
port.
Another resolution, which was left In
the hands of the exeeutU'e committee,
urges a bill providing for the appointment
of probation officers, whose duty It shall
be to care for convicted offenders upon
whom sentence has been suspended. The
bill is designed to keep outside of prison
walls first termers and offenders for
whom there 1b hope of reform.
The election of officers for the ensuing
year resulted in the unanimous choice or
the following: : Horace A. Davis of Â¦ San
Francisco, president; O. V. Rice of Los
Angeles, vice president: A. E. Osborne of

on the upper deck aft was also wrecked.
Many times during the storm it seemed
as though the Ingalls must be lost. The
pumps got out of order and refused to
work in the afterhold. A bucket brigade
was organized and worked steadily ball-
Ing out the water. Some of the barrels
in the hold broke away from their fasten
ing, and beinqr broken spilled their con
tents and choked the bilge hold so that
the pumps cou\d not wbrk. The Ingalls
was formerly known as the Clearwater.
She was built to carry fruit from Hon
duras to New Orleans and is a very. fast
boat.
Damaged by Heavy Seas the Pumps
Become Choked and a Bucket
Brigade Is Formed.
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.-The United States
TRANSPORT INGAIXS IS
NEABLY â¢WRECKED AT SEA
If the Mouse bill is passed in the Senate and
becomes a law It is rate to expect that an
agreement can be made with Oreat Britain
as favorable at least to the United States as
that contained In the. Hay-Pauncefote treaty,
as amended after the House bill is enacted.
This explanation is not based upon any sup
posed want of power or of will In that great
empire to maintain what she considers a Just
or advantageous position, nor yet upon her
magnanimity, for that Wo do not ask, but upon
the'fact that the ean&t -when built will be of
Incalculable value ;.tffrall her North and Cen
tral American possessions, and that she can
never realize these without the
consent and assistance of the United States.
Neither can Great Britain or any combination
of powers construct and maintain a canal at
Panama without our consent. â¢
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â Senator Mor
gan to-day presented part IV of the report
of the Senate Comihittee on.Interoceanic
Canals on the project- of an Isthmian
waterway. It la chiefly Interesting In be
ing a reafflrmation that the House bill
now. pending in the Senate, providing for
the construction of the Nicaragua canal,
"furnished the true, safe and honorable
method of dealing, with the rights, power
and duties with an isthmian canal." The
report says: . Â¦ \
Each new development of facts; each ap
parent change ' of diplomatic situations; each
lapse of concessions made to our citizens by
Nicaragua during half a century; each pur
gestlon or overture for a Joint control of the
canal by other governments in connection with
the United States; each effort to lodge the
.ownership and control of ' this canal in cor
porate bodies instead cf the United States;
each obstruction that was presented, whether
openly or secretly, by competitive lines of
transportation or by speculative enterprises
chartered by States for the- purpose of prevent
ing the United States from executing its settled
policy of the exclusive ownership and control
of a canal â¢ through the isthmns of Darlen,
has the more firmly convinced your committee
that the provisions of. House bill 253S are the
Just, safe, true and honorable method of pro
viding this maritime highway for all the na
tions of the world.
It is needless that any government, corpora
tion or combination of individuals should at
tempt to divert the United States from lta
fixed policy as to the ownership and control
of such a canal and that element of discussion
Is dropped, i Neither 1p It necessary to con
sider any route for a canal besides those of
Panama and Nicaragua, the search for any
other rout9 having demonstrated that only
these routes are practicable.
The report then treats the Nicaragua
route" as the one "selected finally," stat
ing that the/ decisive vote in the Houseâ i
225 to {^-determines the location "so that
it remains only to vindicate that decision
against the pretensions of the Panama ;
route."
The report then argues In detail on the
advantages of the Nicaragua route over
any others. It sets forth what is stated
to be "conclusive proof of the fatal defect
of the Panama route," the complications
in the way of having the United States
take up the Panama route, etc. After re
ferring to evidence given by Panama
canal officials, the report continues:
The ptatement made on that hearing dis
closes the animus of these parties in seeking a
hearing before the committee and in its (Pan
ama Canal Company's) plan of obstruction In
an unmistakable way. It Is not to obtain aid
from the United States. That idea Is dis
dainfully repelled. It Is not to aid the United
States to construct, own and control a canal
at Panama.
These hearings and. reports In connection
with the letters written by Mr. Cromwell lead
to the unavoidable conclusion that the new
Panama Canal Company Is still endeavoring to
defeat a canal through Costa Rica and Nica
ragua, as It was in 1S93.
Morgan Eets forth seven headings in the
"plan to secure delay," including the com
plications on the' Hay-Pauncefote treaty.
He says:
No excuse remains for delaying the action of
Congress, either to gratify the new Panama
Canal Company or to dally with any other
power in negotiations over a measure that <n
ters deeply Into our national financial policy
and wm shape the action of our Government
and people in a great many other Important
matters that concern them. This la a great
and controlling measure of public expenditure
which Is now safely within our means and
Congress should now determine that It will
provide a law to sanction it of else that it
is not worthy of consideration and abandon It.
Says Pending House Measure Pro
vides the Safe and Honorable
Way of Dealing With . i
the Work.

on Isthmian Water

One of the first suggestions which the
new president was heard to offer was the
need of more commodious quarters for tho
railroad offices. He was surprised to find
the officials tucked away In such cramped
quarters and thought it a pity that all the
offices could not be in one building. The
Â¦separation of the departments into three
different buildings he considered poor pol
icy and not for the best interests of the
company.
There was no suggestion made, however,
in regard to a new building, but a promi

matter yesterday, said he would not be

FREDERICK POSTEL. a boss j
teamster, was arrested last even
ing: on complaint of his wife, Mrs.
Annie C. Postel, who charges him
with "adnsir.istering poison, to j
wit, illuminating gas, with intent to kill."
The Postels. together with their three
children. Willie aged 4, Ethel aged 8 and !
Fred aged 19. have been living at 8 Boyc*
ctreet. Father and mother and the two
younger children occupied one room, tbe
mother sharing her bee with the children.
According to Mrs. Postel's etory. 6he
was awakened on Thursday evening by ;
the crying of Willie, who complained that
he was ill. She took the child in her arms j
and finding that he was pale and almost
unconscious, ehe hurried with him to an
adjoining room, where she bathed his
brow and finally restored him to con
sciousness. Upon retiring with her son
to her room Mrs. Postel claims she found
her little daughter unconscious. She car- j
ried her also into the kitchen and bath- I
HAYS INTRODUCED
TO SUBORDINATES
Ing her head restored her to consciousness
and returned acatn to her room. It wa3
then, Mrs. Postel claims, she discovered
that the apartment was filled with gas,
and upon lnvestigatiou found that al
though one Jet was burning, the unllghted
burner was also turned on full force. Mrs.
Postel claims that upon making this dis
covery she charged her husband with
attempting to kill her and the family, and
that he then declared Lhat he intended to
do away with himself, and that when he
went they would co with him.
Mrs. Postel declares that her husband
has often threatened to take her life.
One year ago, she says, he attempted to
poison her by mixing poison in her food.
On the 22d of last January Mrs. Pos
tel began proceedings for divorce on the
grounds of cruelty, but upon the advice of
her relatives withdrew the charges and
a reconciliation followed.
Postel was arrested last evening shortly
after 5 o'clock at his stand at the corner
of Mission and Second streets.
"There is absolute'y no truth In the
charges lodged against me;*' said Postel.
"On Thursday evening my little son was
ill and my wife, myseif and the children,
who slept in my room, were all awake.
There was a coal oil stove burning in the
room and I declared that the smell of
the burning oil was the cause of th*
child's nausea. I turned oft tne stove and
lit the gas. In doing so another jet musr
have been accidentally- turned on. Tho
room was filled with the odor of coal oil
and that is probably why we did not smeii
the gas till fully a half hour after I lit
it. When I did smell It and found tne
jet turned on I immediately opened up all
the windows and let the air circulate
through the rooms.
"As to that poison 3tory my wife tells,
that is also untrue. At the time she re
fers to she ate some canned fruit that
made her 111."
Mrs. Postel Is a comely woman of about
40 years. After she left her Boyce-street
home she sought and found shelter with
friends at Polk and Lombard streets.
The Postcls have been married twenty
one years and have tour children, the
three named and Richard, a Jockey, now
In the East, aged 16.

of cheer failed to infuse new hope
and vigor Into the veins of many,
as is shown Try the long list of
those who would rather commit self-mur
der than live as they had been living.
Yesterday four men. tired of continuing
the struggle, ended their lives and a
young woman who made a similar at
tempt was saved by the Receiving Hos
pital surgeons.
Being; unable any lonper to endure my great
sufferingrÂ» I put an end to them. Pletro Gori
has assisted me In my tribulation. Greeting
to all. j SALVATORE DE LUCA.
After writing these words on a slip of
paper De Luca lighted a charcoal flre in
a small brazier, closed the door and the
windows of his room and lay down until
drowsiness overcame him and Â¦wafted him
into the dreamless slumber of death.
De Luca lived at 4 St. Charles place. He
was a bachelor, 50 years old. sick and de
spondent.
Heartbroken because of the death, of his
wife, George Beauchamp, a young man of
23 years, came home from the funeral on
Sunday and kept his room, plunged in si
lent sorrow. His body was found in bed
yesterday at 704 Lorkin street by his
mother. Mrs. Mahler. Both gas burners
were turned on. An Inquest will be held.
Charles F. Renner, a saw filer, 50 years
old, committed suicide yesterday morning
at his home in the rear of 4215 Twenty
third street by blowing, off the top of his
head with a Winchester repeating rifle.
Renner formerly worked as a saw flier
and machinist for the firm of Hlrschfelder
& Meaney, but was obliged to quit be
cause of sickness. Becoming despondent
and despairing of getting well, he ended
his life. He left three sons Frederick,
who lived with him. and Charles and
John, who are in Vallejo. He was a wid
ower. Â¦ , :
While exercising hl3 greyhounds on the
San Bruno road between the Five and
Six Mile houses vesterday afternoon
Michael Connell discovered the body of
a man on the Johnson & Brown ranch
a short distance from the road. A bottle
partly filled with carbolic acid told the
story of suicide. The body was taken to
the Morgue. From effects found on de
ceased It was learned that the body was
that of Herbert B. Trenear, a journeyman
baker, who until recently had been em
ployed in the shop of John Gammer at
2843 Twenty-second street. Trenear s
mother and sister, who live In San Jose,
were notified and later Mrs. Tease, the
sister, telephoned that she would send for
the body. Deceased was 25 years of age
and single. , . . . .
Tired of life and disgusted with things
In general, Blanch Martin, a young wo
man 24 years of age, swallowed a dose ot
chloroform yesterday. She was found in
her room at 905% Mission street by Officer
F F Dougherty, who summoned an am
bulance and sent her to the Receiving
Hospital. Dr. Bacigalupl soon had tn<Â«
voung woman out of danger and assigned
her to a cot In the woman's ward. Later
In the day she said she was a married
woman, but did not know where her hus
band was.
Thomas Foster and W. P. Rodgers. cat
tlemen from New Mexico, narrowly es
caped death by asphyxiation in their room
at the New Western Hotel early yester
day morning. Both men are strangers in
San Francisco, and 3hortly after their
arrival Sunday night started out to see
the town. They returned to their hotel
at a late hour and went up to their room,
requesting the night clerk before retiring
to see that they were called at 6 a. m.. aa
they were to .leave town on an early
train. To this 'fact they owe thetr ltves.
When he went to call them he noticed the
strong smell of gas coming from their
room and immediately broke in the door.
He found the men in their beds, uncon
scious and gas escaping from an open jet.
Dr Rogers was hastily summoned, as
was also the ambulance from the Receiv
ing Hospital. By the time it arrived the

Ex-Clerk in Custom House
J. D. Gibbs of the National Ath
letic Club applied to Customs Collector
Stratton yesterday to be reinstated In hi3
former position as "clerk" in the office
of the cashier of the Custom-house. Ac
companying, his request was a mass of
correspondence upon the subject of his
former standing under the civil service
rules and letters from, many officials In
dorsing Mr. Gibbs as a man of honor and
probity, i
Mr. Stratton denied the application,
and Mr. Gibbs may tajce legal steps to
ward his reinstatement on the ground
that the position from which he was dis
placed without . investigation and without
any assigned cause, as he alleges, is pro
tected by the civil service regulations.
The documents filed by Mr. Glbbs yester
day Bhow that on October 11, 1S35, Mr.
Gibbs' position was changed from that of
cashier to "clerk to act as . cashier,"
which position Is alleged to be within the
civil Bervlce. On. October 11, 1S97â just two
years later â Collector Jackson addressed
a note to Gibbs announcing that by order
of the Treasury Department his services
would be no longer required.
Mr. Glbbs produces letters to show that
Collector Jackson received from the Sec
retary of the Treasury a letter signed
"Citizen," In which the anonymous writer
called the attention of the Secretary to
the fact that- Glbbs was an officer in the
National Athletic Club, an organization
for the exhibition of prizefighting con
tests. Mr. Gibbs was requested by Col
lector Jackson to make answer to- the ac
cusation of the anonymous "knocker" and
he did so by showing that his superior
officer knew of his connection with tho
National Club and had no objection to
it, and that he had placed the club's
money in the Custom-house safe on only
one occasion, and then there was no
Government money in It. He contends
that he should have had a trial under
the civil service rules and an opportunity
to defend himself In a legal and proper
manner. - -
doctor had succ*e*".ed in getting: Foster
out of danger, but Rodgers was not so
fortunate. He wa^ taken to the hospital,
where Drs. Bunnell and Baclgalupi la
bored over him for an hour before they
succeeded In bringing him to.
Foster, In explanation, said his chum
had gone to bed, leaving him to turn off
the gas. This he did, but Rodgers was
doubtful of his ability to do the thing
right, and insisted upon getting up to
make sure, ana in doing so must have
turned it on.
Frank Lyle. an emjloye of the city.
while at work in one of the sawers at
Sixth and Howard streets yesterday â¢eras
overcome by sewer gas and rendered nn
conscious. He was pulled out by his com
panions in the nick of time. Before the
ambulance arrived he had recovered suf
ficiently to be conveyed to his home at
217 Clara street.
Walter Ikencotter, better known as
Walter Williams, the night watchman, at
the Central Theater, was found by tho
carpenter employed at the theater yes
terday morning in one of the dressing
rooms in an unconscious condition. He
was evidently overcome by gas, the smell
of which filled the place. An ambulance
was summoned and he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Badgalupl
succeeded in restoring: him to conscious
ness. The attaches of the theater think
that the watchman had gone asleep on
the lounge in the dressing-room and had
rolled off, alighting on the gas tube con
nected with a small stove, disconnecting
it- He will recover.
