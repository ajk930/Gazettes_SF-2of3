Wagner asked: "Suppose that an oath
were administered to a cadet when he re
ceives his appointment as a cadet to this
academy, the provisions of which pro
hibited fighting, do you think It would
stop thÂ« practice?"
"Young man, this dishonorable practice
you have described would not be tolerated
in any athletic club in the world. The
upper class man who is a party to the
calling out of a fourth class man for the
purpose of having him thrashed is a
coward, and the fourth class man who is
beaten Is nothing else but a hero. This
morning I received four letters from
Kansas. Massachusetts. New York and
Brooklyn, In all of which the mode of
fighting and hazing here Is called brutal
bullylsm. That Is too mild a description.
I call it brutal cowardice." Â¦: .. -.*
"Oh. bo that's the. code," said Driggs as
he shook his finger at the witness, while
he arose from his seat beside the chair,
then, turning toward the witness,' he
Ebouted: ---r-.
"Yes, sir; it is understood when a fourth
class man Is called out he la to be
whipped.'
an upper class man Is selected especially
for the purpose of administering a sound
drubbing to the fourth class man who Is
called out?"

tent myself In some civil occupation."
"You expect to become an officer very
soon, do you not?" inquired Colonel Clay
ton.
"Yes, Bir."
"Then, after you have become an officer,
would you. In violation of your oath, ac
cept or send a challenge to a duel, fistic
or otherwise?"
"If the provocation occurred In well-de
fined lines I would- not violate my oath,
but would resign and send or accept a
challenge. In the event that I could not
meet and shoot my man on sight."
Speaking of hazing, Wagner, address-
Ing the witness, said:
"Do you know that one William Me-
Kinley, now President of the United
States, when a member of Congress, said
that he would favor the abolition of the
West Point Military Academy in case
hazing could not be stopped there?"
"Yes, sir."
"And the late James G. Blaine had the
same ideas," said Drigga.
"And so also did Zachariah Taylor,"
added Judge Smith.
The witness, at 'Â¦ the request of Judge
Smith, stood up.
During the afternoon Cadet George Rus
sell of New Hampshire was asked by
Drlggs: "Do you think it Is fair play to
haze fourth class men for the purposeof
making them do things which are viola
tions of the academic rules and for which
they are liable to receive punishment by
the authorities of the Institution?".
"Well. I do not think it was unfair."
"You, who have been three years In the
academy, "say so?", said Driggs, angrily. â¢
"Yes, I think the ends Justify the
means," was the reply. â¢
"Were you ever at any soiree where a
cadet fainted?" ,- ' '
"No, slrj'but I saw Cadet Dean feigning
to faint, as he told us he .was going to fool
the upper class men. He was my class
mate, and I was rather amused at his
success." ;^Ci : '-r
"He was not 'cut' for doing this?"
"No, sir."
"Now, what Is the .difference between
a man feigning fainting to escape oxer
cU-inp and a man feigning being knocked
out in a fight?" Inquired General Dick.
The witness hesitated and then, said:
"There's a good deal of difference," but
he failed to explain It.
Cadet Edward L. Oldham of Tennessee
said Cadet Albert was called a Jew and
â¢ a "sheeny." "He was not very popular,"
[said Oldham. "I .heard, he did not show
up very well in a fight."
\ Cadet Fred L.. Dean of Texas, who when
testifying before the military court said:
"I hazed Booz just to, make him feel
'good,", was then called and' sworn.
Judge Smith asked: "How much tobasco
sauce didyou prescribe for Mr. Booz?"
"I don't .remember; but when'I.sat at
his table -I probably did give him some." .
: "Were you not the'ehief exponent of the
efficacy of this eauce In making, the i 'gun

was practically laid at your door?"
The witness said that he had done Â£0
wooden "Willies himself In an hour and a
half, and Drfggs said: "You are the most
remarkable man I ever listened to.
He handed "a list of second and third
class men to Dean and asked him to name
all of those whom he had exercised.
Dean mentioned the name of Cadet Sher
idan as the only one he could remember.
"Why Is It you remember Sheridan and
don't remember about any one else?" ask
ed Drlggs.
"I don't know, sir; I just remember,
about Sheridan."
"Is it a case of convenient memory?"
"Mo, sir."
This answer was drowned In a storra of
hisses, which began In the northeast cor
rer of the room. It ran around the room,
which was filled with women and officers.
The hissing was particularly strong
from the seats behind the committee,
where a score of officers were sitting.
Drlggs, addressing General Dick, said:
"I ask that the courtroom be cleared."
The chairman did not entertain the mo
tion, and said: s 
"The committee will adjourn at 3
o'clock."
Judge Smith said so that every one
could heard him: "I think anybody who
hisses should be ejected from the room,
no matter who he ia."
At the night session Drlggs asked tho
question In a modified form, saying , he
did not mean to impugn the cadet's honor.
This created a divcr?Ion which attracted
the attention of every one. and in the ex
citement the r.ack in which Alexander
T.as concealed was frantically driven to
thf procession which followed the hack.
txvA it was an awful march indeed for
Fred Alexander. The trip to town was
made quickly rnd there was no attempt
to create a diFturbar.ee. When Fourth
and Olive streets was reached the police
who were In the ha^k following the one
in which Alexander was concealed jumped
out and chased several ntgroes.

LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Jan.

assault Miss Eva Roth
last Saturday night, sur-
Found by the Mob.
Then the cry went up: "He Is not here!
he has escaped.- Search the courthouse.
There Is a tunnel between and he has been
me county Jail, and Just as the mob
reached the doors he was locked In the
first cell on the east Bide of the court
house.
.C?ll Door Battered Down.
All the doors of the Jail were locked,
ar.d the crowd first attempted to gain ad
mission by peaceful means. Sheriff Ever
hard refused to deliver the negro up.
Then the crowd pushed its way to the
side door, and using a battering ram the
door was forced from its hinges. Then
the crowd surged into the corridor by the
narrow doorway. A huge iron bar was
secured and the Iron door of the cell room
attacked.
This was finally bent so that It could
be forced far enough back for men to
climb over it. Several gained an entrance
in this manner. In the meantime the
crowd had pushed down the side gate of
the xtockade, and in a moment there was
a yelling pack in the jail yard.
The side door, which was made of heavy
sheet iron, was the next object of attack.
Several of the thoughtful ones of the mob
had provided tnemselves with sledge
liamniers and coldchisels, and it was the
work of only a few moments before the
hinges were cut from this and with the
help from inside it was off its hinges in
a moment.
More men pushed Inside and the Iron bar
was again called Into play and the doors
of the cellrcom broken down.
taken out that way." Then a man with
sharp eyes spied a shapeless, cringing
mass crouched down In the one corner of
the d; < cell.
An exultant cry went up: "He Is here;
we have got him. Get the keys."
Several keys were found lying around
â¢the corridors and these were passed in to
the crowd. They would not work. Then
again a sledce-hammer was called into
action and in five minutes the heavy lock
had been broken off. A fierce yell, the
yell of a beast brought to bay, issued from
the cell. Outside the tension was so t great
that big, strong men tilled the room with
hysterical laughter. Cutslde the crowd
was yelling In a manner that perhaps has
never before been heard In the city of
Leavenworth. Inside the cell rushed
those who were nearest the door.
Prisoner Dragged Forth.
The mob Issued in a moment, dragging
the fiend by the coat collar. He had been
struck on the head with a hammer, but
was still conscious. Men fought to get at
him. They struck savagely at him and
hit only his captors, who guarded him
well.
"Don't hurt him," they cried.
"We'll burn him." was the response.
Outside the stockade the crowd surged.
Alexander and his captors were surround
ed by a solid wall of human flesh. Across
Third street and up the hill into the court
house yard they dragged. him. Then they
stopped.
"Confess before we harm you," said
ther.
"I have nothing to confess," cried Alex
ander. "I am innocent. . I am dying for
Ing about and Into one . of these they
threw him. With the prisoner and a num
ber of captors the wagon started off for
the vicinity of Lawrence avenue and
Spruce street, followed on the run by tha
crowd.
At a quarter past 5 o'clock Alexander
was taken to the scene of the murder of
Pearl Forbes, at the corner of Lawrencj
avenue and Spruce street. The exact
spot where the murdered girl was foun'i
was located by the leaders of the crowd,
and thre a semicircle was formed.
Alexander was brought up in a wason
with a dozen men. The wacon was
stopped in front of the ravine and sur
rounded by the crowd, the leader who had
Alexander calling for silence.
The roar ceased, and Alexander was
shoved forward for the crowd to gaze at.
A howl went up, which was quickly
hushed as the prisoner raised his bound
hands and began to speak. Twice he
started and the crowd drowned his voice.
Knew He Would Be Killed.
"You're coins: to kill me whatever I
say." he said, "but you men are wrong.
I want to tell you right now you've got
the wronsr man. I did not do that, and
some day you men here will run up
against the man who did. I know it ain't
no use to Fay so, for you're going to kill
mo; but I did not do it."
The men standing beside him shoved
Alexander from the wagon and the roar
of the crowd drowned every other souni.
He was quickly dragged down the em
bankment to the pile of wood, with his

friends here. They know I did not do It.
If I. had been guilty I would have said so
a_t the penitentiary and wpuld have stayed
there for life.' The warden told me. Tha
policeman told me so. "Would not I have
told them if I was guilty?"
He did not know that' the town was
bent on lynching, that the minds were
made ur>. that he had committed a crima
that could only be avenged with his blood.
"You lie," they cried, and one huge fel
low, filled more with the lust for blood
than with the feeling of a human being,
struck him in the forehead with his Asz
three times. This seemed not to have the
slightest effect on the negro. "When he
talked his voice was steady. He spoke
with the resignation of a man who sees
only before him death, slow perhaps, but
certain, and was prepared to meet it in its
most awful form.
. Plsads That He Is Innocent.
When he had finished talking: a move
was made for a large cottonwood tree In
the northeast corner of the courthouse
yard. He was backed up against it and
a chain was hunted for. One could not be
found, and while they waited Alexander
was . given another chance to confess. !
"My God,.men," he cried In his agon;.',
"I have told you . that I'm Innocent. I
can't tell you any more. I didn't do it."
"He lies, burn him,'" cried the mob.
"Take him where he committed the mur

The suggestion met with instant ap

President Jordan â Dear Sir: Ever since the
dismissal of Dr. Ross, against your protest,
for expressing In the discussion of public ques
tions opinions displeasing to Mrs. Stanford, I
hax'e considered whether' I. who hold similar
opinions, could be willing to remain in the
faculty of Stanford University. Your recent
call for the resignation of a man whose ability
and independence of character I have ad
mired for twenty years, because he uttered, in
a form courteous to you and to Mrs. Stanford,
condemnation of a policy destructive of the
academic freedom 'in which you profess to be

5 TANFORD UNIVERSITY.
Jan. 16.â The excitement
which surrounded Stanford
University when the dismis
sal of Professor George E.
Howard was announced was
augmented to-day by the vol
untary resignation of two more profes
sors. To-night every one Is aroused and
all are wondering who will be the next to
pn. Where the disastrous results of the
cr.forced resignation of Dr. Howard wil!
end Is hard to say, as the distinguished
historian was one of the most widely
known and most respected professors of
the faculty.
To-day Dr. Howard's callers were \eg-
Irn. Members of the faculty came to him
to assure him of their sympathy and sup
port. Two of them have followed him out
of the faculty fold, ar.d doubtless others
Ve contemplating like action. Throng?
cf students also sought him in his modest
little home, till the drawing-room pre
sented the lively appearance of an after
noon reception such as professors often
p:ve. If Er. IIosp' frie:i<is could be num
bered as lesion. r>r. Howard's must be
enumerated a? a multitude. He hay never
been known to have an enemy, as he an
tagonizes no one. On the other hand, he
5s closer to his students than any other
man of the faculty. Every man or wo
man who has taken work under him has
measured somewhat of the depths of his
sincerity and has been drawn uncon
sciously to the man. It is little wonder,
t* .en. that the members of the faculty are
following him. whither none of them
know.
During these stirring times President
Jordan Is away. Just where he !s no one
here who knows will tell. It is reported
that he is suffering from nervous pros
tration. Anyway, It Is evident that he
Goes not care to be seen or interviewed.
Hudson's Resignation.
Professors Hudson and Little to-day
tendered their resignations. Professor
Hudson"s letter is as follows:
The loss of the two men who tendered
their resignations to-day will bo keenly
felt throughout the university, for Profes
sors Hudson and Little have long 1 been
with the university and have served it
faithfully. Their work probably will bo
discontinued for the present semester, and
the students who have registered in their
classes will be forced to seek other
courses. *
To-day Registrar Elliott posted a notice
that the time within which study cards
might be filed would be extended three
days on account of the confusion resultant
from the vacancies in- the faculty. There
are numerous rumors about the campus
that other professors are to tender their
resignations, but none of them have been
substantiated by the professors them*
selves to-nleht.
There are none who do not have un
bounded faith that President Jordan can
tide the university over the present di fa
culties and preserve its integrity. The
only action which Is possible for him is
to execute Mrs. Stanford's will and re
main steadfast to the trust which Senator
Stanford reposed in him. Should he de
sert his post at this critical hour the most
enduring calamities might befall the
young institution whose destinies his
hands were chosen to shape. The dell
cateness of his position is realized by no
one more than by Dr. Howard himself,
who expresses regret that President Jor
dan is so embarrassed.
terms with Dr. Howard and considered
him the best man that was to bo had for
the place. Putting these facts together,
the only solution consonant with Presi
dent Jordan's well known record for fair
ness and breadth of view Is that he has
heroically shouldered the whole responsi
bility himself in order to shield the bene
factress of the college. That he should
magnanimously do this Is to be expected
of the man. Anticipating the storm
which would follow, he has secluded him
self that he might bear the brunt of the
criticism in silence and solitude.
The fact that President Joidan has ab
sented himself from the university has
caused the feeling here that he person
ally is not the real cause of Dr. Howard's
dismissal. It is thought Improbable that
he would insist upon the distinguished
professor's resignation unless compelled
to do so by Mrs. Stanford. The fact that
he told Dr. Howard in conversation with
him on November 20 that he would not
Insist upon his leaving the university un

Professor Little took his A. B. from the
University of Nebraska in 1S79 and his
Ph. D. at Yale in 1SS5. He was an in
structor In mathematics and civil engin
eering in his alma mater from 1SS0 to 1SS4;
was associate professor of civil engineer
ing for the next five years, and head of
the department from 1890-y3. He resigned
his position In Nebraska to accept, a pro
fessorship in Stanford in the fall of 1393.
Professor Little was stirred to indigna
tion when Ross was dismissed: but to
day when he learned that Dr. Howard
also had gone for similar reasons, he at
once tendered his resignation.
Charles Newton Little, professor of
mathematics Is a Nebraska man, and a
lifelong friend of Professor Howard. He
has been at Stanford for the past nine
years, and has occupied the modest little
cottage adjoining Dr. Howard's. Their
long friendship was strengthened during
the "dark days'* at Stanford, when all
salaries were cut in half and paydays
were irregular at that.
Aroused to Indignation.
Waiving the question of the validity of the
reasons you put forward for your action. I
hereby accept your resignation, to take imme
diate effect. Very truly yours,
, J. C. BRANNER. Acting President.

the university inaugurated In the dismissal of
Dr. Rossâ a policy destructive of those first
principles of academic freedom upon which, as
you have repeatedly said, the university was
originally founded. Ever since the occurrence
of that Incident I have seriously doubted
whether it would be possible for me, con
sistently with my opinions, to retain my posi

row that. In this way, you have clearly shown
that It Is the intention of the university to
inhibit fair criticism of Its methods no less
than frank discussion of public affairs, no
doubt 1b left in my mind as to my course.

FOR THE TWO HOUSES
Senate Work Pertaining- to Public Morals Is
Assigned to the Corporations Committee.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO. Jan. I5.-The bill
which it Is hoped will allow the
division of Santa Clara County
was introduced In the Assembly
to-day, and it comes from the
northâ from a point just as far
iron the county it will most vitally af
fect as the men behind the scheme could
reach and find an Assemblyman. Schilllg
of Yufta City was the one who finally
jiiaeod the measure before the Legisla
ture.
The bill is entitled "An act to provide
for thÂ» formation of new counties and
"he appointment and election of officers.
ihe location of county seats thereof and
the adjustment and fulfillment of certain
rights and obligations arising between
f'Jch rjpw formed counties and the county
or counties from which they are formed."
It was introduced by Assemblyman Bur
rm of Paso P*oblos at the last regular
>-ession of the I>Â«Â»jrislature. and was known
lu Assembly bill No. 557. It was known as
f> pernicious measure as well, and it was
sidetracked before it got as far as its
Jhird reailne. Ij is known this time as
Asj-embly bill Xo. 242. and. with the ex
ception of section 11, it is exactly the same
< Id measure.
Although SehilHg introduced the meas
ore. It is but fair to bolieve him when he
r'^c'ar** he knows nothing about the bill
tn what good or harm it may conceal.
As a matter of fact, the county division
i?tp sought first through the south to find
n rnan who would present the mcaaurf,
r.nd they finally deoidpd on Brougrhton. It
was knewn that Broughton was the run
ning mate of Penileton. and it was hoped
that in Inducing him to introduce the bill
!) would bring to Its support the same in
fluences that put Pendleton Into the
Speaker's chair. Broughton. though a
new legislator, is a wise man, and he
turned the uneasy measure over to Schil
ligr. also a new man, who said he would
introduce it.
Section 11 of the old bill had been
Tossed out. and as a copy of the old bill
v. as usÂ«>d for the new one SehilHg asked
: he reason of the elimination. He was
Â¦snlci that the section might act against
ihe constitutionality of the bill, and so it
had been deemed advisable to strike It
out. The section deals with the assign
ment of the Assembly and Senatorial dis
tricts, and the real Teason for Its elimina
tion is to avoid mixing the county divi-
in the apportionment to be done this
"ffion.
The division of Santa Clara Is the last
of a series of old schemes to make new
counties out of the region including the
Sehillip'B bill was referred to the Com
mittee on Counties and County Bound
aries.
Work on the Santa Clara scheme has
already commenced in the Assembly, for
several of the members of the lower house
admit having been approached on the sub
ject. The plan has not the support of
phrewd politicians, however, for no one
knows just how the land lies and so far
there is no money in sight.
The idea Is that Henry Miller will put
up tho money, but no one knows whether
or not he will. No one has consulted the
Governor to find out whether he- favors
the measure, and no one lias interviewed
the powersâ the Southern Pacific and the
bossesâ to know if their Assembly will
pass the measure and if they 'will sup
port it in the Senate. The only feature
which evidences the advice of a politician
is the introduction of the bill. The divis
ionlsts were advised not to put in the
measure themselves and not to have any
one in the vicinity of Santa Clara do li
for them. They wore advised to go into
the country and find some man, thorough
ly honest, accommodating and new to the
business of legislation. They hunted and
finally found Schiliig.
The bill is one that allows sections of
counties to do just about as they please.
When they acquire population enough" to
fill a fair-sized city ward they may make
a county out of themselves under the pro

southern end of the Santa Clara Valley
and the first of a new crop of county
division schemes that is coming up all
over the State. The original idea was to
take portions of Merced. San Benito and
Montorey counties, where they come to
gether, and make a county out of them,
making the division or Santa Clara a
scheme to, come in with them/ Then a
plan to link the upper ends of San Benito
and Monterey was taken up. but that was
dropped, leaving only the Santa Clara
fsfhrme. The motive in all of the cases
wps tho -Fame â to get pespopsion of the
new county offices and the contracts for
county buildings and to increase the land
values near the county scats, the land
being held by the schemers.
Of the new ideas one comes from the
southern part of Santa Cruz and the
northern part of Monterey, with Watson
ville decided upon as the county scat; an
other is to divide Sonoma from cast to
west with Petaluma as the new county
s<*at;' another is to divide Santa Barbara
from north to south, with Lompoc as the
new; county peat, and another is to di
vide Alemeda from north to south, with
Haywards or San IÂ»andro as the new
county seat. All of these may come up in
a bunch.
Melick suggested that the committee
proceed to investigate the question of the
failure of the Commissioners to supply
vouchers and then report to the Assembly
for instructions.
"I believe that to be the wise course,"
said Chairman BH?s; "I am not in favor
of proceeding blindly to rii investigation
to satisfy thÂ«t-whim ,o*j%n individual." .
Acting on Â¦ Mellck's 'suggestion. Con
troller Colgan was asked to appear before
ihe committee. He complied and said that
the entire $130/WY> appropriated had"b"eeji"
drawn from tho treasury. He said the hill
making the appropriation and putting the
commission beyond the control of the
State Board of Examiners had been very
cleverly drawn, and that there had been
no parallel, to it in the legislation of this
State.
In answer to questions regarding his
reason for drawing warrants on the de
mands of the Commissioners without re
quiring vouchers, he made the same ex
planation that he gave to The Call last
nightâ that after the decision of the Su
preme Court that the act appropriating
money for an exhibit at the'Hamhurg Ex
position was constitutional, he had
drawn warrants against the treasury
without vouchers, as the commission was
in a foreign country and could not pre
sent vouchers until its return and the
closing of its accounts. He had followed
this precedent, which had the approval
of the Board of Examiners, in his deal
ings with the Paris Commissioners.
"Has there been a reasonable time .for
the Commissioners to file vouchers?"
asked Dr. Hasson.
"I do not know. I do not know when
these people got home," answered Con
troller Colgan., ... .
The Controller showed that the -Ham
burg Commission was eighteen months in
closing the accounts. .;
A deputy from Secretary of State
Curry's office was summoned and brought
documentary evidence of the I regularity
of the bonds given by the Commissioners.
"It looks to me," said Melick, "as if
they were quarreling among themselves
and want to use us as tools by forcing an
investigation before a final report is really
due. SUU, it Is just as well to go ahead
with this preliminary Investigation."
"It seems to me," Bliss said, "that an
investigation now would be premature." .

Dr. Hasson wanted to know what the
charges against the Commissioners were,
but no one took the trouble to enlighten
him.
At the morning session of the Assemblj,
Â¦Speaker Pendleton appointed Stewart of
Amador to the vacancy left by the resig
nation of Alden Anderson.' He also re;
quested the committee to ' meet at 2
o'clock in the afternoon to. take up the
Paris commission investigation in accord
ance with the suggestions /'contained -.in
the two messages of the Governor. , - . .
J. A. Bliss of Alameda was' made chair
man of the committee upon motion of Dr.
Hasson of Orange County. Speaker Pen
dleton came in soon after the meeting be
gan and Melick asked him why that par
ticular portion of the first mesmge had
been referred to this committee. Pendle
ton replied that he -did not know the rea
son for that action by the committee, that
had the Governor's message in charge,
but he believed the reference was 'proper
and that the committee had ' power. -to
make the Investigation. . â¢ Â¦
"The Impression has gone out," Melick
said, "that I am eager for this investiga
tion, but it Is a mistake. There is also a
misapprehension abroad that I- am anti
administration. 1 am not., against - our
State administration. "When I think it Is
right I am for It, and I am against it
when I believe it to be wrong. ,.. -<
"My interest in this matter arose first
from the letters from Major Ben C. Tru
man, published In the Graphic of Los An
geles. I may state also that the editor of
the Graphic wrote to me that he had
voluminous correspondence on the subject
from Major Truman- which he would be
glad to give us- If investigation should be
made."
Melick and _ Bliss... the . 'two members of
the committee who were supposed to bu
most eager for investigation, were flu;
men who molded the committee's opinion,
taking care, ; meanwhile," to. explain that
the idea that they wer 0 anti-administra
tion was a misapprehension. The out
and-out Gage mi>n on the, committee kept
very still. They probably will have' more
to say at"WÂ»* next meeting, after the pow

ff MEXTO, Jan. 13 s -TVHh- caucusing
(L . and wrangling over Assembly and
Senatorial districts, and all- the
pulling and hauling over the ques
tion of apportionment, the various dele
gations have crystallized, and now the
last of them Is ripe for organization. It
was the apportionment that started the
crystallization, but It is not likely to end
there, and unless harmony and coalition
be restored it may lead to factional lines
and consequent bitterness.
The last of the outsiders met to-day.
The south had organized. San Francisco
had organized. Alameda had organized;
and this afternoon in response to a call
sent out quietly by Duryea twenty-five of
the Assemblymen from the other coun
ties of the State met and talked it over.
The call was not sent to the San Fran
cisco men. the Alameda men or the men
from the south.
Duryea of Placer presided, but there
was no formal organization. There was
consiilfrable talk, the burden of which
was that the "centers" were getting about
what they wanted, and it was time for the
outlying country to look out for and as
sert itself. It was decided to meet again
and invite the corresponding Senators
and tht Democratic minorities to join the
meeting.
There has been a great deal said about
the luck of the south so far. and its solid
front has been the cause of a. good deal of
envy. As for San Francisco, there has
always been the suggestion of boss influ
ence over its delegations, and Alameda's
case is almost purely one of apportion
ment.
Under the present scheme of apportion
ment Alameda is entitled to three and
a half Senators and seven Assembly-
ALAMEDANS CAUCUS ON
UNIVERSITY MEASURES
men. Not being concerned In anything*
beyond political surgery, the apportion
ment bill trades the half-Senator for a,
whole Assemblyman, making four Sen
ators and six Assemblymen.
But Alameda insists that she is entitled
to four Senators and eight Assemblymenâ
!n- other words, to another full Assembly
districtâ and her delegation Is prepared to
fight on the subject. To secure these
they must be filched from the surrounding
country represented by members of the
conference to-day, and this explains why
Alameda was not bidden to the meeting.
The south in not altogether solid on the
subject of apportionment, but its differ
ence is strictly within itself. Carter of
I*â¢ Ansele*. chairman of the southern
delegation, has a scheme to ioln Ventura
to I^js Angeles to make the Seventh Con
presslonsl District, which will make a
district with more than thÂ«Â» allotted popu
lation and overwhelmingly Republican.
But that would brine the Kichth District
en far below th* population r*Â»quire<1 that
Tulare would have to be included, and
then thÂ« district would go Democratic.
In the country Senator Davis* of Ama
dor. Alpine. falaveras and Mono has a
flKht on his hanrl*. The hill would give
him El Dorado. Alpine, Amador, Caln
veras nnd Tuolumn*. taking away Mono.
but this would makp the district Demo
cratic, Davis declares, nnd he objects.
The Apportionment Committee' r>r thÂ»
Senate will meet to-morrow morning Tt
will hardly do more than organize, but
from then the fight will be on.
In the meantime, with the apportion
ment as a starter, the counties nrÂ» array
ing themselves. There is no bitternesWn
it so farâ just an intention on the parnflf
what might be termed the country coun
ties to b> considered part of the State;
but it will lead to more than that b*Â»fÂ«r">

Consideration of the army reorganiza
tion bill was resume*! informally. Teller
then offered his amendment to the section
of the bill authorizing the President to
retire an army officer under suspension
by sentence of a court-martial. He al
luded to a statement made a few days
ago by Hawley about the possibility of
war on account of the jealousy of the
European powers.
"Is not the Senator perfectly aware."
Inquired Hawley, with evident warmth,
"that I repudiated that statement?"
"I do not care whether you did or not,"
retorted Teller.
"I know you do nol." observed. Hawley.
"I have got It here and I will -read it."
said the Colorado Senator. "The Senator
spoke of something in the air, and he re
ferred to the purchase of the Danish isl
lands. The newspapers of the country
took It up and used It. There Is no dan
ger of a foreign war on account of the
Danish islands, with tne South Sea islands
thrown !n. We do not need the srrrat
army of 1CO.00O men to resist any threat
ened or supposed war from any people in
the world. I know we are not loved in
Europe," continued Teller. "Our compe
tition In trade is creating great feeling
over there, but I fail to see any nation in
the world that Is going to war with us on
account of trade."
Warren of Wyoming, a member of th<Â»
Committee on Military Affairs, challenged
the accuracy of a statement made by Tel
ler that the bill provided for a standing
army of 100,000 men. It provides, he main
tained, for a standing army of 54.009 men,
all of whom are absolutely needed accord
ing to Information laid before Congress.
The Senate then went into executive
session and at 5:50 p. m. adjourned.
Teller said he would expect a report
from the committee and if one were nol
made he would know how to. get it.
A resolution presented a few days aso
by Teller, providing for the printing as a
public document of the petition of ?i'J<>
Filipinos offered to the Senate, was laid
before the Senate.
Stewart of Nevada declared his opposi
tion to the resolution on the ground that
it was "an untruthful recital of conditions
in the Philippines."' *
The resolution was referred to the Com
mittee on the Philippines.
The amendment was to strike out of the

An amendment by Bartholdt to instruct

an inquiry into the feasibility of the es
tablishment of a system of reservoirs In
the St. Francis Basin, with a view of cut
ting down the height of the flood water
at the Junction of the Ohio and Missis
sippi rivers, was adopted.
Mondell then offered an amendment to
appropriate $50,000 for preliminary exam
ination of reservoir sites In each of the
arid and semi-arid States. The amend
ment -was lost without division.
Without completing the bill the House
at 5:05 p. m. adjourned.
Hopkins of Illinois, who was In the
chair, ruled that the amendment was in
order. The amendment was lost â 37 to 85.
Other amendments of a similar character
met a like fate.
Burton promptly raised the point that
the amendment was not germane. A long
debate followed over the point of order,
the representatives from the arid region
insisting that the River and Harbor Com
mittee had jurisdiction over the whole
subject.
Mondeh of Wyoming offered an amend
ment to appropriate loO.OOO for construct
ing reservoirs in Wyoming for the pur
pose of holding. back the tlood waters of
the Missouri Klver. The amendment also
carried an authorization for J165.000 to
complete the reservoirs. This amendment
was to bstthe entering wedge of the advo

The House then resumed consideration
of the river and harbor appropriation bill.
King of Utah criticized his democratic
colleagues for supporting immense river

The Senate resolution to appropriate

such, and to have you feel that at any time
If there are any matters In regard to which
the ' Southern Pacific. Railway can work to
mutual Interest with you In the development
of the coast and of your business Interests we
shall at all tlmett be - only too glad to give

to have met you. I thank you.
I am very Klad to be with you here to-day,
gentlemen, to meet you and to acknowledge
your cordial, kindly expressions of welcome.
Thoy are, only what California. Kan Francisco
and the . Pacific Coast generally have been
noted for. and I see, although twenty-live yearn
have passed since I was first on the Pacific
Coast, that you have not changed In that re
spect, and. In fact, II It were possible, the
reception extended strangers seems even more
cordial and more friendly than before.' Com
ing as I do a stranger In your midst It In
peculiarly welcome to me, and to-<3ay I am
not going to do more than express my appre
ciation of that welcome, and to say to you
that I expect to make my home with you. I
I believe from the platform and on the flocr
cf the Chamber there are never any speeches;
and If you are very well acquainted with our
railroad men you know there are very few of
them that are ready at all times and on all
occasions to lift up their voices. I believe
there Is but on* railroad man who has a
national Veputatlon In that respectâ at least
but on? with whom I have been very familiar.
He lives on the Atlantic coast. Since I have
been here I have been led to believe, however,
that there Is one, not distantly connected with
the Southern Pacific, that has upon occasions
and at various times been able to lift up his
voice. I am looklng-ln his direction, but 1
won't mention any names Just now.'
I nm very Kind to br tvltii you liere to-Â«lny, gentlemen: - to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WED NESD AY, JANUARY 16, 1901.
Chief Executive of the Southern Pacific Is Introduced to Merchants at the Annual
Meeting of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.
3
PRESIDENT C. M. HATS of the
Southern Pacific Company was
the guest of honor yesterday at
the fifty-first annual meeting of
the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce. At his suggestion his formal
introduction to the merchants of San
Francisco, assembled In commercial 'or
ganization, was made informal. "When
the proceedings of the d3y were finished
PreFidtnt l!ays was introduced to the
members of the chamber. A general hand
fhaklr.p ensued and by his hearty, rental
and affibie manner the new ruler of
Southern Parific destinies ingratiated
himself into tbÂ« hearts of the men who
pay freights ar.d make railroads profitable
rr^iiertlep.
Outside of the introduction of President
Hays to the commercial representatives
cf "this city the meeting was much the
fame as in the years preceding:. Papers
Â¦were readâ Â«="me of them heavy with the
on a theme dear to the progressive ele
ment present. In part he Bald:
American exports to .Afla crew from. J27.
421.881 in 1893 to J78.I3S.f76 in 1S99. Hence our
consuming Interest in Asiatic affair*. The
Asiatic demand for American products Is felt
by the manufacturers, merchant*, mechanics
and producers. The farmers and fruitgrowers
of Â»the Pacific Coast are among the largest
l>enenciarles. Europe looks askance as the
United States decreases the Asiatic demand
for European goods. Ttie fiercest struggle Â«
In Northern China and the Russian Asiat c
region. The foreign trade of China approxi
mated S330.00O.0OO m V>W. an advance of *44,
000.000 on the total of 1S3S. and double that of
1S90 Sixty-three PÂ«* r cent Â°' lne tolaI annual
trade of "China is with the British. Japan has
11 per cent the United States 10 per cent and
Russia 6 per cent. The balance is with France.*
Germany and other countries. The United
States and Germany are paining Chinese trade
at the expense of Oreat Britain.
The natural advantage In Asiatic trade is
with the l"nlted States 1 . We have what Asia
wacts I am nnt of the optimistic brotherhood
who tfrnk the four hundred millions of China
Ing on our ability to take at its flood our tide
ct prosperity. They have seen us turn out
the record warship of the world, from one of
the nnesr yards In the world: they have seen
us make the nrst patriotic response to a na
tional appeal for troops for foreign service;
they have seen us found near by two universi
ties which any city In Europe would be proud
to own; they have Been us project a second
shipbuilding plant and know that within
eighteen months we will have .added to our
already excellent docking facilities a drydock
equal to any In the world, and noting our
splendid and sweeping advance on these com
mercial, constructive and intellectual lines,
they incline to the idea that we will meet
the demand of our unprecedented opportuni
ties. It 1b our duty to Justify this idea, to
conserve our commercial power, to work with
the cohesive strength of a united community
and to ;etilously guard our prestige.
Charles Xelson, the retiring president,
who has for a successor in the chair of
the Chamber of Commerce. George A.
NewhaJl, told the commercial story of
the past year as far as San Francisco and
the Pacific Coast were concerned. He
The shipyards of Great Britain, all
â¢working: together, could turn out a biz
steamship every day In the year.

J"RT as a baseball player loses his
-attlng eye and 'a fighter his ca
nndty far standing punishment,
some horses suddenly display n.
marked tendency for a track that
form followers would not stake counter
feit money on their chances. The course
at Oakland yesterday was almost heavy
and sticky enough to pull the plates from
the feet of the equine performers. That
is why nearly everybody supposed Tx>co
chee would lose Topmast, but he failed
absolutely to do anything of the sort.
Just previous to this, however. Gusto did
a turn trit staggered the talent. Frank
Phillips" horse Sam Fullen was considered
one of the certainties of the day. closing
a 7 to 10 chance for the third event. Im
agine the surprise when Gusto, with S3
pounds and J. Rausch up. backed from 25
to 15, went out and won in a gallop. Bu
chanan, astride the favorite, got cut off
on the back stretch, finishing a handy
second over Prejudice. Weights must be
a most telling factor ln the winner's
make-up, ' for his preceding race had a
very murky look.
Had it not been that Kenilworth and
Nellie Forest both docked on .time at
scant odds, the favorites would all have
been beaten. As both Gusto and Topmast
were heavily backed, the books did not
profit to any great extent over the re
verses of the first choices.
Parmenion. owned by Frank Doss,
seems cut of luck. With Buchanan up.
he looked to have become mixed up with
his own kind ln the first number, and
was well backed at twos. Buchanan man
aged to "scramble the eggs' during the
first part, getting to the wire ln time to
be beaten a neck by Del Vista, a 7 to 1
shot. Mounce rode the winner.^
Almost any sort of a price about Kenil
worth. favorite for the five furlong dash
following looked ripe and mellow. Three
to ten was the post quotation. Turner got
the colt away to a flying start and though
defeating Grafter^but a neck had some
thing in reserve. Coburn landed El Topio.
a 100 to 1 shot, in the show. \
There was such an avalanche of coin
in the ring to be placed on Topmast to
win the mile and a quarter selling run
that the odds against Lpcochee went from
7 to 10 to 9 to 10. Fille d'Or, a 100 to 1
shot, cut out the pace and then ( When
ready Mounce with Topmast went to thÂ«
front, winning hands down. The first
nlly fl Nellle H Forest
looked a "moral" for the five and a half
furlong spin which followed and she did
score without any <?Â«ort. Loneliness a
20 to 1 outsider, took the place from El
Sonoro by a neck.
Bassinger had the mount on Necklace,
favorite for the concluding run over the
Futurity course. The black mare did not
get away from the post any too well and
had to be content with third money.
Mounce on Flamero finished an easy win
ner over La Mascotta. a 10 to^ outsider,
which made most of the running.

SENSATION IS PREDICTED.
Congressional Committee Expected to
Make a Scathing Report
WASHINGTON. Jan. 15.-The Secretary
of War Is holding the report of the Court
of Inquiry, which investigated the Booz
case, in reserve to be made public simul
taneously with that of the Congressional
Investigation Committee. The. Impression
prevails at the War Department that the
Congressional committee will sweeplngly
denounce the tactics of the cadets at the
ft /t, ry Mt a< ;? dem , y and of
the Institution by the officers in charge
This report will undoubtedly create a
sensation, and It is feared preiudice the
country against the academy. The report
?L th ,ti C ,Â° Urt Of , In <* u \ r y- w nÂ«e admitting
the existence of hazing, is not so con*
demnatory and acquits the officers Â»n
charge of any responsibility, and in fact
compliments some of them for their ef
forts to minimize the practice. , The mill
tary rer,ort will, therefore, to some ex
tent, offset that of the Congressional com
mittee, and the Secretary and War De
partment officials are anxious to make it
public about the same time the commit
tee submits its report to the House It
may be that Congress, anticipating rush
tactics, will adopt a resolution calling for
the report of- the Court of Inquiry and the
publication of the real reason causing the
War Department to withhold the report
and may cause the Secretary to direct
that it be given to press without await
ing Congress'nnn 1 notion.
In reply to Driegs, the witness said he
believed that if fighting and hazing, with
Â«^nv X^rH ! ?? of C ir \ ny f ? rms - wer e done
away with it would be all the better, and
nÂ«^< essary Ji 1 ! funny things which did
no Injury could be abolished also
CADET HAZING DENOUNCED.

About 3 o'clock the Warden notified the
Governor that he had delivered the pris
oner Into the hands of the Sheriff.' The
Governor, it is said, was highly incensed
tit the Warden's failure to obey Instruc
tions.
The Governor was anxious to send mili
tia to preserve order, but he was assured
by Leavenwcrth .men who waited on him
that it would aggravate the trouble.
Juet before the party left the peniten
tiary for the Jail the Warden requested
Â«.nd received the following; receipt for his
Ceilvery of Alexander:
Delivery of the Negro.
When the fire had died down sufficiently
to allow the crowd to approach what re
mained of Alexander there was a wild
scramble to obtain relics, bits of charred
flesh, pieces of chain, scraps of wood â
everything that could possibly serve as a
eouvenir was seized on with morbid avid
ity by the eager people.
governor Stanley was in telephone con
rultatlon with Warden Tomlinson all day
yesterday. The Governor seemed very
anxious to preserve the name of Kansas
from any mob violence. It was under
stood that yesterday morning he instruct
ed Warden Tomlinson to refuse to deliver
Alexander to the Sheriff, but to afford him
proper protection.
Prom 5 to 8 o'clock there was a steady
stream of people going to the scene of the
burning. These were persons who had
been unable to get away from their work
ln the afternoon, but were determined not
to mlsa Feeing the awful spectacle.
As noon as the crowd saw that life was
extinct it began to slowly disperse. There
were hundreds of the more morbid, how
ever, who stayed to the last.
Men kept piling on wood all the time
until about 7 o'clock, when the flames
trere allowed to die down.
Aj^ain .Alexander was asked to make a
confecsion. but the negro replied that he
had nothing to say.
AÂ« the flames leaped about him Alexan
der realized that his death was near. He
clapped his hands together and begun to
ewlng to and fro, while the crowd yelled.
In leÂ«s than five minute* he waa hanging
limp end lifeless by the chains that bound
him. '
Burned at the Stake.
Before the match was applied. John
Forbes, the father of thÂ» murdered girl,
stepped up to Alexander and paid:
"Are you guilty of murdering my daugh
ter?"
"I don't know whst you have me here
for." said the doomed man.
Forbes replied, "For killing my girl on
thin very spot."
"Mr. Forbes, if that's your name, you
have the wrong man." ,
"Burn him. burn him/." cried the crowd.
â¢â¢Gentlemen, you have got lots of time,'
isaid Alexander. "You are burning an in
nocent man. You took advantage of me:
j-ou cave me no show. Can I see my
mother?"
A man In the crowd called for the moth
er of the negTO. but she was not in the
crowd. He then said: "Will you let me
Ehake hands with all of my friends."
"You have no friends In this crowd, y^u
beast." said one of the men in charge of
the nejrro; "if you have anything to say,
do so in a hurry."
Another man then stepped up and said
to Alexander. "Make your peace with
your God, nigger, for you will surely die."
Coal oil was then applied for the second
time, and while it was being done Alex
ander called to friends of his in the crowd
Â«jid bade them good-by. He did not seem
to realize that he was to be burned at the
ftake and talked rationally until John
Forbes, the father of the murdered girl,
lighted the match.
Confronted by the Father.
Long- before the wagon containing the
doomed man arrived at the place, a crowd
lathered. Determined men as they ap
proached carried rails and boards. The
?pot chosen for the Ftake was the exact
one on which Pearl Forbes' body _ was
found on the mornlnj? of November <. It

Fe track and a hundred yards north of

The first thine done was to plant the

to the upright iron with wire. Aroun.l
the Ftak*Â» boards and wood was piled. To

The Judiciary committee of the Senate
announced to-night that a bill would be
prepared making death the penalty for
murder and also for rape in cases where
Â£Â£& K as u T d - , The bin n without a
doubt be made a law within a few days
"The death penalty must be > re
stored in Kansas and then things of
this kind will not happen. I am go
ing to do all I can to restore the
death penalty, and I think that this
awful happening will bring the legis
lators to the same opinion."
"The Sheriff is to blame, and no
body else. I could not very well send
the troops there in the face of the
repeated assurances of the Sheriff
that they were not needed and not
wanted. Of course, I would have sent
them anyway if I had known the real
facts, notwithstanding the assur
ances of the Sheriff, or I should have
ordered Warden Tomlinson to \ hold
the prisoner a short time longer. But
it is done now, and to the fair State
of Kansas belongs . the disgrace.
"The Sheriff of Leavenworth Is
either a despicable scoundrel or a
coward," said the Governor to-night.
"There was no reason in the world
that the negro should not have been
protected to the last. The whole mili
tary power of the State would have
been devoted to that effort and the
Sheriff knew it all the time.
TOPEKA, Kans.. Jan. 15.â Governor
Stanley is very indignant at the result of
the lynching at Leavenworth this after
noon, he says It will result in the resto
ration of the death penalty in Kansas, as
it should do. The Governor condemns
Sheriff Everhardy or Leavenworth In un
measured terms. He says the Sheriff
should be made to make suitable retribu
tion if such a thing would be possible. ,

Declares tfce Lynching: a Disgrace to
GOV. STANLEY INDIGNANT.
About 9 o'clock the Coroner's iury and
two police officers went and frot the re
mains, taking them to an undertaklne es
tablishment. The Coroner's Jury has been
named, but the Inquest will not be held
for a few days.
The remains were viewed by thousands
and up to the time they were taken away
cqrr'aees and vehicles were continuously
passing by the soot. Xn expressions of
regret were heard from any source.
The Sheriff was taken sick; during the
excitement at the Countv Jail and Is now
confined to his bed. Admittance to the
room is denied, and a statement from him
to-pieht is unobtainable. The Sheriff
nsked the Governor for the State militia
by telephone, and the Governor replied
that he would send the militia, but would
require a written request or a telepraph
message. This, for some reason, was not
done. There was no reauest made for
protection byUn'ted States troops from
Fort Iyeavenworth. The Sheriff upon re
oupstinp the delivery of Alexander to him
said he thoupht he would be able to nro
tect the life of the prisoner, and the War
den upon this assurance turned him over.

j*^ ORONADO BEACH, Jan. 15.-The
ft t-eeond day of the field trials
(I . opened cloudy and much cooler
than yesterday, and the second
series in the doty left unfinished
last nig-ht was b^gun at 8 a. m.
P. D. Linvllle's Maseie P and C. E.
XVorden's Doc were first caljed for, but
tin birds were found during the heat.
Bow's Son was put down with Joe Cum
reinsr'p Boy and Cuba Zep -with Lemon
Ears, but neither brace seemed able to
locate a bevy of scattered birds, which
had been flushed by the spectators. This
concluded the second series, and the first
brace calted for in the third was Linvllle's
Maggie F and J. E. Terry's Lady, the lat
ter having shown the most consistent
work of any of the dor* Â«P to this time.
The first point was made by Maggie F,
who remained stanch until her handler
errired, but broke in when the bird was
flushed. Ladv then made two points in
quick succession and was steady to wing
and shot.
Dr. Daniels and Bow's Son went down
next, followed by Count's Mark and Cuba
Zep. Peach Blossom and Northern Hunt-
Trrs were then called for, and each se
cured a point on Finglec
C. K. Wilson's English setter dog Clip
per W and the Ptookdale Kennel's pointer
iVtronella were next sent off. Clipper W,
who had been up to this time off in nose,
began to show his metal, and put up the
bc*t race of the day. He exhibited great
vigilance in handling his birds and was
stanch on his points and steady to shot
and wing. During- the last half of the
heat h!s work was faultless, and seldom
is there ?<>en in a De r bv stake as fine tin
exhibition as was given by Clipper \V.
Mapgie P and Peach Blossom were then
put down and Blossom showed err^at Im
provement in nose and point work over
her previous heats. Her speed, range and
style were never in question and her point
work in this heat brought her rapidly to
the front. Mangle also showed Improved
nose and made some stylish points. At
the conclusion of this heat Lady was
railed for and was out down with Peach
Blossom, during which Lady secured a
point and the dogs were ordered up and
the winners announced as follows:
Firstâ J. E. Terry's orange and white
Krglish Fetter bitch Lady (Count Glad
stone IV-Peach Mark). Second â W . "W.
Van Arsdale's black, white and tan Eng
lish setter bitch Peach Blossom (Count
Gladstone IV-Peach Mark). Thirdâ P. )).
Linville's white and black ticked English
setter bitch Masrpie F (Count Gladstone
IV- Lady Rodschaff).
Lady, winner of the first, was a most
consistent performer throughout the two
days' running, and Is both tÂ«-st and stylish
and a pood worker under a*.* conditions.
Peach Blossom is a little sister to La^1v
and Is much like her in style ard with
an equal amount of speed she is fully as
snappy In her points, but showed a lack
of nose In the opening heats. All three
of the Derbv winners were sired by Count
Gladstone IV.

N. W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â Great
Britain now has grievance against Ven
ezuela, as shown in a statement made
public by the State Department to-day.
"The Department of State," the circular
says, "has received a cablegram from
Caracas to the effect that the Venezuelan
authorities at Bolivia have seized two
steamers of the Orinoco Shipping I and
Trading Company for use against the rev
olutionists. It Is understood that this
company is English,* although an Ameri
can is president of it and Americans own
a good deal of stock in the company The
vessels, however, fly the English flag"

BUTTE, Mont., Jan. 15.â Announcement
of the engagement of William A. Clark
Jr., youngest son of Senator W. A. Clark,
and Miss Mabel Foster of Butte has been
made public. According to the stories of
the young man's friends the engagement
Is the climax of an Interesting bit of ro
mance.
Young Clark Is but 23 years of age and
since his graduation from the law depart
ment of the University of Virginia two
years ago he has been engaged in the
practice of law in this city as one of the
attorneys of his millionaire father. He
has not been in society much, and when It
became known that he had become en
gaged to Miss Foster there was much sur
prise and not a little speculation, as the
couple had never been seen in public to
gether. The romance was explained to
day. Last Thanksgiving day Mr. Clark
threw open the home of his father to a
public party given to the children of the
city. Among the guests were Miss Fos
ter and her parents. Young Clark met
her for the first time. The. first oppor
tunity he had he made an avowal of love
and a proposal of Â» marriage. In answer
to the younp lady's modest protests the
young man declared that he had watched
and loved her for more than a year, and
had longed for many months for the
chance to tell her so.' The young- lady
took the matter under advisement and
In time gave her answer, the result of
which is the announcement of their en
gagement.. A. brilliant reception in cele
bration of -the/ event has been given. The
match has,' it -Is said, the full approval of
the young man's father.
: The marriage will probably take place
after the lenten season and the young
people will make an extended tour of
Europe, after which they will probably
occupy Senator Clark's house, in New
York. Young Mr. Clark, although he has
about $5,000,000 in his own name, will con
tinue the practice of law. In Butte he .Is
the lawyer for the poor people, as he
never accepts a fee from those who can
not afford to pay It. Miss Foster is 18
years of age and the youngest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. John W." Foster, prominent
old-timers of Montana, of moderate cir
cumstances. ; ' She Is ,'handsome < and > ac
complished and a great favorite in society.

General Brabant while addressing a con
ference of Mayors at Cape Town said the
authorities w.ere anxious to keep the war
away from Cape Town if : possible, but
that the only . hope' of doing this lay in
tending 10,000 men to the front. He urged
that no precaution should be omitted to
prevent the enemy from" advancing far
ther south. .-,..,-
General Paget has taken his force to
Pretoria to reflt. Many of the men are
suffering from enteric fever. Three hun
dred Boers captured a small British con
vov at Bronkhurst Spruit, near Pretoria,
but made off .after liberating the prison
ers.
Indications are not wanting that the
decision of the Government to send rein
forcements has not been taken a moment
too soon. Colonel Colvllle's mobile col
umn, which has been pursuing the Boers,
has been obliged to rest at Greylingstad,
to erect a blockhouse and to cease opera
tions until reinforced by mounted troops.

The committee on site appointed by the
Alumni Association of the United States
Naval Academy has conferred with the
Municipal Art Commission as to the loca
tion of the naval arch. Neither the site
on Riverside drive nor that on the Bat
tery was definitely decided upon. Colonel
William C. Church of the Army and Navy
Journal said: "We aregoing to have an
arch, no matter what any one says."
The arch in all probability will be ex
actly like the one temporarily erected In
Madison square and Fifth avenue. The
$200,000 already collected will be turned
over to the new committee.
Murder of a Marine.
The first under-the-sea telephone, built
according to the invention of Dr. Michael
Pupin, is to be laid between Florida and
Cuba for the United States Government
by the buyer of the patent, the Bell Tel
ephone Company. Last July Dr. Pupin.
having secured his patents here and
abroad, offered his discovery to the Amer
ican Telephone and Telegraph Company.
The company Immediately bought an op
tion on the Invention, extending to Jan
uary 1, 1901. Then, under Dr. Pupln's
direction, the company equipped a line
from Bedford station, on the Harlem Rail
road, which ran partly under water, to
New Bedford,' Mass., thence to Albany
and on to Plttsbiirjr. There the wire ran
overland, the coils were placed at inter
vals of about two miles and were enclosed
In glass insulators on the poles. The test
was so satisfactory that about two weeks
before the option expired the company
paid the money and closed the contract
with Dr. Pupin.

"What we want," said the Bishop! "is
good, pure tenement houses on which the
union labels of morality have been
placed. The only piece of advice I gave
to those who came to me when the com
mittee of fifteen was appointed was that
at least two representatives of labor
should be placed on the committee, and
that the committee should recognize all
classes. We have Initiated this crusade
not for the crushing 1 out of vice; but for
the triumph of virtue."
Under the Sea Telephone. *
The Bishop then read an extract from a
newsp'aper describing the settlement of
the East Side bakers' strike, and how the
men stood outside of the strikers' head
quarters and shouted to the passersby
that the strike had been settled, and that
hereafter the people would get good, pure
and clean bread, on which union labels
had been placed.
"We may undoubtedly do' a great deal
In civic matters and make vice less In
decent, less insolent. The mere suppres
sion is not essential. Nothing has Im
pressed me more during the last three
months than the efforts of the metropolis
to make Itself a more decent city." '
"The subject for the evening is 'After
Suppressionâ What?' and I suppose I must
say something' as to title. I confess
that if I had the authority of prescribing:
the subject I should change It to read
'The Anti-Vice Crusade; Before Suppres
sion â What?' for I have grave doubts as
to the immediate suppression of vice, and
I have met many who are equally doubt
ful.

Yet it must remain among the possibilities of the

As he has relied on' the impetuous-emotions of the

/~* OLONEL BRYAN proposes to stay in focus

weekly newspaper. But he has long depended upon
the word of mouth and refuses to substitute expres
sion per plumbago from the pencil's dreadful point.
Therefore he plans further hippodroming over the
country. His first efforts will be spent upon Texas.
But there are signs that the Lone Star will not twinkle
so kindly upon him as heretofore. The Democratic
press of that State is saying that other men have a
right to be heard and heeded. The Texan press even
goes so far as to say that the people of the South arc
tired of Casabianca oratory, and that the boy who
stands on the burning deck so long with cold fee:
is not an object of sympathy or interest. In. fact, -they
don't believe the deck is burning at all, and say
Colonel Bryan was mistaken when he said it wa3.

AH of these considerations appeared in Australia.
The problem obtruded itself there upon public atten-'
tion and did not retire from view until it was effi
ciently solved. Shall we admit that we have less fa
cility of adjustment than was shown by the people of
a crown colony of Great Britain?
It seems clear, from the viewpoint of an economist,
that the people of the whole country have rights
which the stock men and politicians must respect.
They have a right to prevent the destruction of their
propertj' and the decadence of their diet.
In allotting the range to leaseholder^ it is proposed
that every land-owner and every stock-owner shall
have his share allotted and assigned to. him at a com
mon rental per acre, lo be fixed by the Secretary of
Agriculture. In addition to this, the law will protect
the right of the mineral prospector and the new agri
cultural settler, against whom the leaseholders' rights
have no sacredness. With these safeguards and the
application made optional to counties, we are con
vinced that there is no ground at all for opposition.
The meat consumers are in every State, all over th*
Union. They have certain equities that cannot be
ijfnored. They are owners in common of the public
domain on which the ranges lie. They have an in
defeasible right to say that thtir property in the
ranges shall be so preserved and used as to return
to th-m a consideration in the economy of living and
the sufficiency of their diet The ranges are a means
of production. The consumers of that product have
a superior right to the maintenance of that means in
sll its vigor.
One reason for opposition to protecting and re
newing the ranges by .Â¦> leasehold system is the unjus
tified belief of the small stock men and agricultural
settlers that the leases will be put up for sale to the
highest bidder, in which event the great stock
cvvners and corporations would outbid the other in
terested classes and monopolize to themselves the
entire range. It should not be necessary to say that
no such arrangement would ever be sanctioned by
Congress or could ever become the law.
THE STOCK INTERESTS.
A DECREASE of 60 per cent in the supply of
rar.ge cattle, concurrent with a 20 per cent in
crease in population, implies a difference of 80
f.er cent between the demand for and the supply of
beef. The rise of 40 per cent in the price of beef
within a short time may be accounted for by that dif
ference. The cheapest production of beef is on the
ranges. With the destruction of their forage and the
decrease in the stock they can carry has disappeared
the most economical element of production. .
Of course the present owners of range cattle are
getting now a high p:ofit on their stock. But when
they look through that profit to the foreshadowed de
struction of their business, they sec in it no profit at
all.
It is like securing more light by burning the candle
kt borh ends. When it is consumed there is no light
ar all.
This is a nation of meat-eaters. Not only are we
meat-eaters by reason of racial characteristics, but for
climatic reasons. Th? remarkable physical energies
of our people are related to the superior generosity
of their diet.
If we permit the most economical means of pro
ducing meat to be destroyed, we are . forcibly
abridging the diet of the people, to the abatement
of their energy, which means the enfeebling of the
national power. The problem to be solved is the
economizing of meat production. That involves
restoration of the potentiality of the ranges. As they
have been destroyed by use in common, they can
never be restored by continuing that policy. As the
price of beef rises the combat for range feed becomes
more strenuous. The rise in price and fall in th
amount of feed is infallibly reflected in the increase
in murders committed on the ranges in battles for
their possession. There was never less food, nor
higher prices, nor more murders, than during last sea
son. Nearly a score of lives have been lost and
thousands of animals have been killed in the relent
less competition. It is time for economists to con
sirfer the problem and for the stock interests to listen
to reason.
PROGRESS IN SAMOA.
WE are having so much in the way of weariness
of the flesh and vexation of spirit in the man
agement of the white man's burden in Porto
Rico and the Philippines that we have reason to be
thankful for the crumb of comfort that comes to us
from Samoa. It appears we are doing well in those
far-off islands, and by contrast with the Germans in
Apia are winning golden opinions from all sorts of
natives.
Late reports from Tutuila, after recounting certain
unpopular and seemingly unjust acts on the part of
the Germans in their islands, say that in Tutuila
under -American rule affairs are booming and prog
ress is being made in every direction. It is announced:
"The traders arc doing more than double their pre
vious business, and the natives are contented and
h?ppy. They are the envy of their cousins^ in the
neighboring islands."
' . Some details are given to illustrate the general state
ment. These are to the effect that the Government
work is progressing favorably; that the natives have
willingly agreed to sell an important front, on the
beach to the Government, and that they intend to use
the money received for the concession to build a
handsome church. It is added that work has begun
in constructing a road around Pago Pago harbp
and that as soon as that is completed further roads
will he constructed.
Such reports arc gratifying, and it is ib be hoped
the money due to the natives for the water front will
be promptly paid. It would be too bad to have the
building of that "handsome church" delayed by red
tape at Washington. We have started out well in the
island and have now the favor of the people. It will
be our own fault if the present good conditions change
to evil, and instead of a number of well-pleased na
tives we have a discontented and suspicious popula
tion to deal with. Let us hope, furthermore, that the
reported "boom" at Tutuila is not going to attract
that class of American speculators and office-holders
who, in their greed for gain, would not hesitate to
defraud not only the natives but the Government
itself. -

THE BELSHAW POOL BILL.
WHEN Supervisor McCarthy introduced his
resolution on Monday approving the Belshaw
bill for the regulation of pool-selling and book
making he undoubtedly designed it as a step toward
the reopening of Ingiesidc Park for such practices.
The step was fortunately baffled by the action of Su
pervisor Stafford, who objected to the resolution and
had it referred to the Police Committee. The resolu
tion is none the less significant of a willingness on the
part of some of the municipal authorities to set aside
the existing restrictions upon pool-selling and book
making, and consequently is a matter to which the
people of San Francisco should give immediate at-
The Belshaw bill prohibits the selling of pools or
bookmaking on any trial or contest between men.
animals or machines, or the maintaining of any place
â¢.vhere such booV'making and pool-selling is carried
on, except within the inclosure or building in which
the contests take place. That is to say, it prohibits
pool-selling and brÂ»okmaking outside of racetracks,
but permits it within the indbsures that surround the
tracks. * The bill applies equally to the selling of pools
and to the making of books upon coursing matches,
prize-fights or any other form of contest used for the
purpose of that kind of gambling.
When the bill was made public The Call obtained
legal advice as to the effect it would have upon the
municipal regulations prohibiting bookmaking and
pool-selling within inclosures as well as without. The
authorities agreed that the State law would not inter
fere with the municipal law! City Attorney Lane, one
of the authorities consulted, stated that the Belshaw
bill as presented leaves it in the power of the city to
piohibit bookmaking and pool-selling at the tracks.
The exercise of police power by the State in prohibit
ing certain practices outside of certain inclosures docs
not prevent the city in the exercise of its police pow
ers from prohibiting the same acts within those in
closures.
According to that legal construction the Belshaw
act in itself is not a menace to the city, but the- Mc-
Carthy resolution in the Board of Supervisors shows
that it may be made use of to revive at Ingleside those
evils of which San Francisco has had such disastrous
experience. Supervisor Stafford therefore deserves
the commendation of all good citizens for his action
in preventing its immediate adoption.
It is to be noted, moreover, that something of .i
change appears to have come over the minds of sev
eral of the Supervisors. There is Joseph Sadoc
Tobin, for example. He has been known as an oppo
nent of gambling, and, in fact, once introduced a reso
lution prohibiting downtown pool-selling and book
making on all sorts of contests, but on Monday he was
one of the Supervisors who expressed himself in favor
of permitting it for a "limited time."
It is true that in the discussion on the subject the
Supervisors who favored the resolution were careful
to say they favored a limited "racing period," and did
not say they favored a "gambling period." That
careful use of terms was, however, but an evasion.
There is no ordinance of the city that prohibits racing.
The ordinance which resulted in closing InglesiJe
track and virtually driving the gamblers out of the city
goes no further than to prohibit pool-selling and
hookmaking within th: inclosure. The so-called races
were but fakes. Their sole purpose was to provide a
means of gambling. When the gambling was stopped
the racing stopped. Consequently those who now
advocate a "racing period" can have no other intent
than that of permitting the kinds of gambling which
are necessary to render that sort of racing profitable
to the promoters.
Upon this showing it is clear the Belshaw bill
should be rejected by the Legislature. It is at best
an illogical and immoral measure. If bookmaking
and pool-selling be pernicious outside an inclosure,
CL-n it be any less pernicious when carried on inside
an inclosure? Is there in any fence or wall ever
erected a magic of sulricient power to render harmless
within its inclosure practices that are notoriously evil
when carried on elsewhere?
However fair the Belshaw bill may seem upon its
face, its effect woull be to confer upon Eastern
gamblers who control racetracks the privilege of poo!
sdling and bookmaking while denying that privilege
to outsiders. It would not have the direct veffect of
reopening Ingleside, but it would undoubtedly tend to
do so. That much is made evident by the McCarthy
resolution. The old evil out of which there came so
much of fraud, defalcation, theft, crime, murder and
suicide is once more threatening the city. The danger
is not to be ignored. The people should take action
C>TÂ»-^HE famous naval observatory in!
II Washington, says the Boston Post,
I dates back only to 1844, although for
il thirty years previous to this time
efforts had been made to Induce
Congress to found a national observatory.
In 1838 Lieutenant J. M. Gilllss, a young
naval officer of very superior intellect and
enterprise, began a series of observations
in an improvised observatory on Capitol
Hill. Ills work was so successful that
Congress passed a bill appropriating $25,000
for the erection of a suitable building.
Lieutenant Gilllss planned tho structure
and remained in - charge of it several
years.
Additions were made in 1847, 1848. 186S
and 1S73. The two first instruments which
we.re placed were a 4.1-lnch Troughton and
Slmms mural circle and a 5.3-inch Ertel
transit. They were extremely good in
strument's for that time, and it was con
sidered that ik, great deal of money had
.been spent. Tn 1873 a 26-inch Clark equl
torial was purchased at a cost of $46,000.
This is the third largest telescope in the
country, the two largest being the Lick,
36-lnch, and the Yerkes, 40-Inch, Instru
ments. Great telescopes of this kind are
used principally for measuring faint
double stars, satellites and in observations
for stellar paralla. The satellites of Mars
were discovered by Professor Hall with
the 26-inch equltorial at the naval obser
vatory.'
Besides the telescopes, the observatory
ov.n many chronographs, decks, chro
nometers and associate apparatus, photo
heliographs, transits, etc.. many of them
being of antiquated type. In (fact, the
During many years the observatory was
purely a naval institution and was under
the Bureau of Navigation. I-Ine officers of
the navy were detailed from time to time
to be its superintendents and Its instruc
tors were for the most part naval men.
This has been changed within very recent
times, and although the Institution Is still
under the care of the Naval Department,
and is controlled by naval officers, Its
astronomical director, professors of
mathematics and most of Its astronomers
are university men. The present super
intendent is Captain Charles H. Davis and
the first and second assistants are Lieu
tenant Commanders Charles H. Fox and
Benjamin W. Hodges. Professor Stim
son J. Brown Is astronomical director and
director of the Nautical Almanac.
storerooms of the observatory are verit

paratus. . tvS-%- -
* A very important room in the observa
tory is devoted to clocks. Here all the
chronometers for Issue to naval ves
sels are rated and tested, and an exten
sive time service is maintained. Included
in this is the daily automatic correction
of some hundreds of clocks in the Govern
ment buildings at Washington and the
dropping of time balls in New York. Bal

leans.
The present site of the observatory Is
about a mile and a half from the original
building, which was abandoned In 1S91.
It is one of the most complete and con
venient establishments of the kind In the
country, the best feature of its construc
tion being the small detached buildings
for each of its principal instruments. The
main building Is given over to the offices
and computing rooms.

STATE PRESS COMMENT
ON LEGISLATIVE DOINGS
In Course of Which Some Editors Wax

The Legislature has committees and

The State Legislature started off har
moniously by apportioning $16 per diem
oatronage to each Senator and half that
amount 5 to each Assemblyman This
amounts in the aggregate to the Insignifi
cant sum of $1024 per day. In this way a
lot of useless legislative offices are created
for the dear friends and relatives of the

Bishop's statements as to the Police Department m
New York, it could be shown here how policemen,
by bribery and threats, although their office was cre
ated for the protection of the weak and the assaileu,
have sought in their official dress to tempt innocent
maidens . from the paths of virtue â how they have
aided, instead of preventing, the violation of law at
the polls, and in various ways become the servants of
crime and foes to the law."
' That is certainly a heavy arraignment to be made
against a city that has always been pointed to as the
typical American community and the model for all
others. As it has been made by a committee of rep
resentative citizens it is to be presumed to be accurate.
It may be taken, therefore, as another illustration 1 of
the quietness with which Philadelphia manages in
some way to take the lead without having her leader
ship noted. She does an enormous business, her in
dustries are in many respects larger than those of
New York or Chicago, and yet she is never heard to
blow about her enterprise. Now she comes forth to
start the new century as the wickedest town on earth,
and the country will be more than ever puzzled to
know how she manages to do so* many things without

WICKEDNESS ON THE QUIET.
PHILADELPHIA has furnished the new century
with something in the nature of a double sur
prise. In the first place a committee of her
best citizens have in a formal document declared
her to be more wicked than New York, and in the
second place they have applied to a New York bishop
to come do\rn and move them to repentance.
That Quakers should turn to Episcopalian Bishops
for guidance, that Philadelphia should admit a need
of New York inspiration, are strange things them
selves, but the strangest part of the whole wonderful
proceeding is that so much wickedness as is reported
to be in Philadelphia should have kept itself quiet for
all these years.
Of course the country has been aware at times of
rumblings in and around Philadelphia, but has never
suspected any serious disturbance. Whenever the
rumblings have been sufficiently noisy to attract more
than a passing attention and to induce outsiders to
inquire the cause of them an investigation has gen
erally shown nothing worse than Matthew Quay
shaking the plum tree and John Wanamaker and the
rest of the "hog combine" squealing for the plums.
It now appears, however, there is and has been for
a long time serious wickedness in the quiet city. At
a recent mass-meeting called by the reform commit
tee the chairman, in introducing Bishop Potter of
New York, said: "The statement made by the com
mittee in their letter of invitation to Bishop Potter,
that the times of Tweed in New York scarcely sur
passed in corruption those of this day in this city,
seem to me to fall quite short of the truth. At no
time nor place in history does acorrupt and thieving
rinj? seem more skillfully and completely, and hope
lessly to have gained ascendency than here and now.
Not only is there a continuous and large majority in
councils, 70 per cent of whom' are supposed to be
purchasable, of men who make no concealment of
their principal purpose being to violate their solemn
i oath of office and make traffic of the great franchises
I of the city for bribes, but in corroboration of the

Steamers That Left the Sound a Week Ago Have Not Been
Heard Fromâ Vessels Bound Here From Japan
and China Almost Given Up as Lost
p-"Yl">3HE Place where news of the over-
I due fleet could be obtained is a spot
I the underwriters would like to lo-
Jt cate. Many of thÂ© coasters are
away behind and a number of the
deep-water ships are being reinsured.
Three of the vessels relieved the hearts
of their owners by putting in an appear
ance off the Heads yesterday morning.
They were the British ships Montgomery
shire, the Duchalburn from Newcastle,
Australia, and the American bark Prus
sia from Pugct Sound. The latter was
sixteen days Retting here from Port
Blakeley. while the Montgomeryshire was
seventy-three and the Duchalburn sixty
eight days coming from Australia. Cap
tain Edwards of the Montgomeryshire
must pay for a dinner on account of his
long run. When the Montgomeryshire
and Duchalburn were lying in port at
Newcastle he "bet the dinner" with Cap
tain Forbes that he would beat him five
days into San Francisco. Instead, both
vpsspIs came in together. Both vessels
made ordinary passages, while the Prus
sia had nothing but head winds and cross
seas to contend withÂ»all the way down.
STEAMERS LOOKED FOR.
Rainier and Mandalay Should Have
Made Port Several Days Ago.
The steam schooner Rainier is now out
seven days from Seattle, while the Man
dalay has not been heard from since she
left here on the 6th lnst. for Coqullle
River. The chances are that the Rainier
has been detained by the heavy weather
that has prevailed along the coast, while
the Mandalay may bo In Coquille River.
The wires are all down between here and
Oregon and it has been impossible to
either telephone or telegraph from Grays
Harbor or Coquille River. The chances
are therefore that the Mandalay is bar
bound and that the Rainier is in Clallam
Bay waiting for a chance to get out.
Sailing of the Grant.
The United States army transport Grant
will pet away for Manila to-day. Chief
Officer Kldpton of the Lawton will j?o out
a.Â« her chief officer and Captain Brugulrre
will be in command. Captain Goorge H.
Whitney and Carl F. Lehners, the local
inspectors of hulls and boilers for Alaska,
will be among thÂ«> passengers on the
transport. Their clerk, George D. Clagett.
will accompany them and on their arrival
at' Honolulu they will inspect all the ves
ppls that were formerly under the Ha
waiian flag. There may be a few con
demnations, but taking them all in all the
Hawaiian coasting fleet is as pood as any
similar class of vessels in the world.
Water Front Notes.
A milk wagon and a Valencia-street car
were In collision near the ferries at 2:25
p. m. yesterday. The car was on the East
street crossing when the wagon ran into
it. The driver was thrown under the fen
der of the car. but escaped serious injury.
The horse was badly hurt and the milk
wagon demolished.
Ten minutes later a mail wagon and a
Ha'fjht-street car was In collision at the
same spot, but nobody was hurt.
The Italian ship Cavialiere Ciampa was
on fire yesterday afternoon. The flre tug
Governor Markham went to her assist
ance and soon drowned out the flames.
The damage was small.
The revenue cutter Perry started out
yesterday on another search for the miss
ing British ship Andrada. As has already
been told in ThÂ« Call, the Andrada left
Santa Rosalia for Portland and after tak
ing aboard a pilot off the Columbia River
was driven to sea. Since then nothing has
been heard from here. The Perry has
been out searching 1 the Vancouver coast
for over ten days arfil'thla will be her sec
ond venture in search of news of the miss
ing vessel.
The steam schooner Acme was launched
at Alameda Point yesterday. She vas
built for the Biuslaw River trade. She
Is 1G2 feet long. 34 feet beam and 10 feet 6
Inches deep. Two similar vessels are to
be built for the coast trade. .

THE DUCHALBURN WON BY FIVE DATS. â¢
This Is one of-the most elaborate state
ments or attempts to define common em
ployes that has been made. The subject
is one of the greatest difficulty because
employments are so numerous and fit so
closely .together. Had Lord Abinger been
gifted with prescience or seen even go
dinjly the wonderful multiplying of em
ployments growing out of the invention
of machinery and the use of steam per
haps he would have paused or at least in
timated his Inability to deal with the
subject in a satisfactory manner. Soma
glimpse of the greatness of his failure. will
appear from the decisions that will now
be given; a still stronger proof is the leg
islation in Great Britain and many
In Illinois the Supreme Court in a re
cent decision has made another attempt
to define fellow-service: * The servants jf
the same master, to be co-employes, bo
as to exempt the master from liability on
account of injuries sustained by one re
sulting from the negligence of the other,
shall be directly co-operating with each
other In a particular business: that is.
the same line of emoloyment, or . that
their usual duties shall bring them Into
habitual association, mi that they only
exercise a mutual N influence upon each
other promotive of proper cautton. The
idea is that the relations between the
servants must be sucn that each as to the
other, by the exercise of ordinary cau
tion; can either prevent Â« or remedy the
negligent acts of the other or protect him
self against its consequences, and. of
course, where there Is no right or no op
portunity of supervision, or where then*
is no independent w:ll, and no right to
take measures* to avoUl the negligent acts
of another without disobedience to the
orders of his immediate superior, the doc
trine can have no application."
Who, then, are in the same common em
ployment? The Supreme Court of Vir
ginia answers the question In this man
ner: "The fellow-servant or co-employe
for whose negligence the company is not
liable is one who is in the same common
employment â that is, in the same shop or
place with and having no authority over
the one injuredâ and who Is no more
charged with the discretionary exercises
of powers and duties Imperatively resting
upon the works than the injured party,
but where a person is placed In charge of
the construction or repair of machinery,
the dispatching of trains, the maintenance
of ways, etc., fie is not a fellow-servant
with those under him, nor with those in a
different department of the service." In
another -case the same court remarked:
"They â¢ are co-employes, engaged in tht^
same department of service, who are
thrown together in the performance of a
common duty and having opportunity to
observe and Judge of the liability and
qualifications of each other."
Who Are Fellow-Servants in Illinois?
ginia?
It may be remarked that when this rule
was ilrst declared by Lord Ablnger In
Great Britain and by the courts in this
country no one ever dreamed that its ap
plication would be po difficult. In truth,
no other legal rule has ever given rise to
so many contradictory decisions. Are the
engineer and conductor of a train fellov.v
servants? If they are. neither can recover
of their common employer for an injury
caused by the other. If they are not fel
low-servants the rule is otherwise. In
some States they are held to be follow
servants, in some they are not.
Who Are Fellow-Sarvants In Vir-
Difficulty Ui Applying the Rule.
Keeping this rule in mind that the em
ploye is always liable for his own\negli
gence, either when he Is acting alone or
with a servant, we remark that an em
ployer is also liable to his servants in all
cases where one is injured through the
negligence of another who is not working
in the same common employment. For
example, if a carpenter in a railroad shop
were injured through the negligence of an
engineer while riding on a train that was
carrying employes engaged in making re
pairs, he would not be regarded as a fel
low-servant of the engineer and would
have a good case against the company.
Who, then, are fellow-servants, and not
entitled to recover from their employer:*
except In those cases In which the latter
themselves are negligent in not employing
competent men, suitable appliances, etc.:
and who are not fellow-servants and en
titled to look for redress to their employ
ers whenever they are injured through the
negligence of other servants? The ques
tion is divided into two parts: one relates
.to the classification of employes, the other
to their relative position of mere laborer
or superintendent. The first part will now
be considered.
Employment?
In the first o'f this series of papers It
was stated that a servant assumed the
risks of injury from other servants who
were engaged in the same common em
ployment. In other words, if a servant
was injured through the negligence of an
other servant employed in the same way
he could not turn to his employer for re
dress, but only to the servant who had
caused the Injury. A man may be compe
tent yet negligent. We also set forth that
It was the duty of the employer to pro
vide competent servants, safe tools, ma
chinery, places of work and also to give
instructions whenever the occasion re
quired. If he were neglectful in these
matters he was liable to a servant who
was injured through the negligence of an
other. Thus if an employer hired an in
competent engineer to run a train ' he
would be responsible to a conductor who
was injured through his unskillful man
agement of his engine, unless the con
ductor knew he was incompetent and con
tinued to act with him. If he did not
know, then the employer would be liable
for the consequences of employing s Â»uch a
man or of retaining him after hls'lncom
petency was found out.
On the other hand, If thÂ© engineer were
competent at the time of employing him
and through his negligence the conductor
should be injured, in many States he
would have no claim against the employ
er, for the risk of the engineer's negli
gence was assumed by him when he
agreed to conduct the train.
Possibly some reader may not Bee clear
ly the difference between the two cases.
An engineer may be competent and yet
do a negligent thing; if he does, the con
ductor assumes this risk and bears the
consequences. An engineer may be incom
petent, and If he is the conductor does
not assume the risk, and If he is injured
can look* to his employer for redress. Bays
Mr. Justice T)anforth of the New York
Court of Appeals: "It is no doubt settled
that an Employe of a railroad company
takes the natural risks of his employment,
and amofsg othors the risk of injury re
sulting from the negligence of his fellow
servants. This rule, however, has no ap
plication if the company has at the same
time disregarded Its obligation to provide
either. a suitable roadbed or engineer, cars
or other necessary appointments of the
railroad, so that the injury is not entirely
caused by the negligence of the other fel
low servant, but. in part at least, is the
result of that omission of duty. In sucti
a case the negligence of the co-servant
will not exonerate the company from the
consequences of its own default." In the
case above supposed the negligence of the
company would consist In hiring the in
competent engineer, and in- doing so the
company would be liable for the conse
quences of his conduct. SuppoBe. however,
he were competent but was given a very
imperfect engine to run. If he knew that
it was imperfect and dangerous and ac
cepted the position he would assume the
risk of it, but if the conductor was in
jured by using such an engine he could
recover from the company, because it is
its duty to furnish proper tools, appli
ances, etc. If they are not of this char
acter those who use them, knowing what
they are. assume the risk of doing so;
hut those who do not know, as the con
ductor in the case just supposed, do not
assume the risk of the defective engine,
and the company, so far as it is con
cerned, is negligent in using it and must
make their losses good. The fireman in
such a case would probably assume the
same risk as the engineer, for he would
probably know as much about the engine;
consequently if he were injured he could
get nothing; but the conductor, even
though a fellow servant, could recover
because he does not assume the risks of
negligence of the company itself, and the
known use by the company of a defective
engine is one of them.

In like manner the courts have decided
on the question of a car dispatcher and
the operatives on a train. In most States,
however, the courts hold that they are- not
fellow servants. One of the cases in which,
the court considered the question at great
length arose In Connecticut. The court
remarked that the train dispatcher was
supreme. The whole power of the corpo
ration, whose duty it was to move thÂ»
train, was delegated to him. He acted in
its name, by Its authority and In Its stead.
The engineer was bound to obey hla order.
An engineer of the company received an
order and he obeyed. He did not know the
consequence, but the company did, or
should have known. In executing thÂ»
order he was Injured. "Reason, justice
and law require that the company should
be held responsible.

There has been more difficulty over thÂ«
question of car inspectors and brakemen.
In Indiana they are not regarded as fel
low-servant>. In Pennsylvania the court
held differently. "We are clearly of opin
ion." says the court, "that a brakeman
and a car Inspector are in the sanfe- circle
of appointment; they co-operate in tha
same business, and the former knows that
the employment of the latter is one of
the incidents of their common service."
Ohio chimes In with this rule, but kicks
against the rule prevailing almost every
where that a brakeman and conductor on
the same train are fellow-servants.
Car Inspectors and Brake-men.
In Ohio a railroad track repairer waa in
jured by the negllRence of an engineer;
the injured man claimed that they werÂ©
not engaged in the same common service.
The court thought otherwise. The Court
of Appeals of New York had decided the
same question not long before in the same
manner. The reason for these decisions
wan that the departments of duty occupied
by both were alike, necessary and indls
pensahle for carrying on the primary ob
ject Of the company â namely, the speedy
nnd feafe carrying of passengers and
freight over the road..
Irr New York, Illinois and many other
States the rule first declared by the Su
preme Court of Wisconsin prevails. But
It uoes not everywhere. In the famous
case of Farwell vs. the Boston and Wor
cester Railroad, which was one of the
earliest in this country deciding the great
question that an env/toyer waa not liable
to an employe for an injury caused by
the negligence of another employe, an
engineer was Injured by the carelessness
of a switch tender. Both were held to be
fellow-employes, engaged in the same
common service, and consequently the en
gineer could recover nothing from hia em
ployer. .!..
In "Wisconsin It was first decided in 1SZ-1
that an engineer and brakeman of a train
were fellow-servants: three years after
ward the court decided they were not.
The Judges in the last case disagreed:
some of them were not members of the
court when the first case was tried, but
two of them were members, and one of
these changed his opinion. Finally the
court changed its opinion again and re
turned to its original rule.
Let us begin with the case of a con
ductor. Is he a . fellow-servant of the
brakeraan or of the trainmen with him?
This is the rule in California. Conse
quently, if one is injured by the negli-
Kence of the other, the injured man can
not look to the company i'or relief; for in
law it has not been s ?Â« .iRcnt toward him.
If an outsider were injured by his negli
gence the rule would be different: the neg
ligence of the employer would be regarded
as the negligence of the company. In one
of the California cases the court said that
"a laborer, a trackworker and a conductor
were all fellow-servants."
Is a Conductor a Fellow-Servant?
States to relieve in cart at least the diffi
culties into which the courts have fallen
in applying 1 this famous rule.

and diastase, which actually nerform the
work of digestion and give the abused
stomach a chanctf to rest and to furni3'a
the body and brain with the necessary
nutriment. Cheap cathartic medicine!*
masquerading under tue name of dyspep-
sia cures are useless for relief or cure of
Indigestion because they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia in all Its forms is simply a
failure of the stomach to dlge9? food ami
the sensible way to solve the riddle and
cure the indigestion Is to make dally usa
at meal time of a safe preparation which
is endorsed by the medical profession aaid
known to contain active dltrestlve prin-
ciples, and all this can truly bo said of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
All druggists throughout the United
States. Canada and Great Britain acll
them at the uniform price ot fifty onu
for full treatment.
As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat furnishes the most nutriment in a.
highly concentrated form and Is digested
and assimilated more quickly than vege-
tables or grains.
Dr. Julius Remusson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run down
In health and of low vitality should eat
plenty of meat. If the disestlon Is too
feeble at first it may be easily strength-
ened by the regular use of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal. Two of
these excellent tablets taken after dinner
will digest several thousand grains of
meat, eggs or other animal food In threj
or four hours, while the malt dlastaso
also contained in Stuart's Tablets causes
the perfect digestion of starchy foods, like
potatoes, bread, etc., and no matter how
weak the stomach may be. no trouble will
be experienced if a vegrular practice Is
made of using: Stuart's Dys-epsia Tablets",
because they supply tho pepsin and dias-
tase so necessary to perfect digestion, aai
any form of indigestion and stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach will
be overcome by their dally u.Â«e.
A healthy appetite and common sens*
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats Is undoubtedly the best, ia
spite of the claims made by vegetarians
and food cranks generally.

NEW YOIIK. Jan. IE.â There was a confus
ing mixture of sentiment In the stock market
to-day. The eteel stocks proved the sensation
of tlie <Jey arid their erratic fluctuations we're
convincing evidence cf the unsettled frame of
xr.lnd airing the eteel interests. There was
eoir.e early weakness in the group In spite ot
en opening rise of Z% in National Tube and
of 2 po4r.ts in Tlnplate. but the \rhcle group
became etrong later and rose en an average
between 1 and 2 points ovtr last night. For
son:* inscrutable reason the declaration of 8
per cent dividend to be distributed In quarterly
periods caused pronounced weakness in the
Eroup. Tiniilate itself drcrped back nearly 5
jioir.ts. The current sunnise as to what divi
dend TrauM be declared reached the limit at 5
-*r cent, eo that the 8 jÂ«t cent dividend was
far in excjfs of the most Fan^uine estimate.
Pome Felling to realize by insiders was to be
Â«>x.l>ecte<J. but the turprising fact was that the
buying attracted by the larse disbursement
tves quite significant and <Â»r.t!re!y Inadequate to
absorb the real I zinc.
The more moderate conjectures as to the
future lavcraiile developments In other steel
ctorks made speculators feel that their move
ment on Rood news was likely to be similarly
disapnointisig. The bears were not slow to
take advantage of this frame of mind. Their
toiling forced an extreme decline of â¬"4 In Fed
eral Steel, accompanied by a rumor that to
day'n dividend would Mmp'y be a quarterly of
VJt. per cent, omitting the expected lump divi
dend of I per cent. After the close ot the
market a 5 jx-r cent dividend was declared.
Eteel and Wire was forced down 4% and Na
tional Â£teel. Smelting, Steel Hoop, Colorado
Fuel and National Tube from 2 to 3 points.
Tlie episode is by acme regarded as reflecting
the impression produced by the utterances and
projects pi the country's leading steel mag-
Rate. â¢"Â¦Â« thÂ« same influence *Â»-aa perhaps

the following report fcr the week ending Mon
day: â¢
â¢Temperatures belcw the normal have con
tinued <iurlEÂ« the week In nearly all parts of
the State and severe frosts have occurred in
rr.nst sections. The vcail.er has been gener
ally cloudy or leggy, ar.4 rain has fallen
through >m the entire State. These conditions
sr* regarded as favorable for ail agricultural
Interests. The cold weather has checked too
rapid gfowth of grain and the premature bud
ding of deciduous Iruits. With the exception
of slight injury to citru>- fruits in portions of
Jiouthern California and to pasturage in some
localities, the eÂ«vere frosts caused no damage.
"The rain has been very beneficial, particu
larly in Fouthcrn California, \vh*re it is re
ported the- precipitation has b.een sufficient to
Insure good crors If conditions continue favor
able. In all oiher portions of the Slate there
has been an abundance of rain for present pur
poses, and warni. clear weather would be wel
comed by farmers. Plowing and seeding have
been euspende'l except en the sandy uplands
and in most j.laees the soli is too wet fur con
tinuing this work at present. A large acreage
of grain has sJready bten sown and this will
be materially increased as soon as possible.
There will also be a large acreage of sugar
beets and b*ar.s.
-"Eariy sown Frain and alfalfa are making
good prewth. with indications of heavy crops.
Pasturace is abundant in all sections. Fruit
trees are in good condition and pruning is

CHICAGO, Jan. IS.â May wheat opened %c
lower at 77%c to 77%c and under the discour
agement of weak Liverpool cables and liberal
Northwest receipts sagged to 76%c. On the
theory that a reaction was about due there
was some buying on the declines and prices
slowly climbed over the 77c mark and later,
moved thereto by a decrease of 37S.0OO bushels
In the world's visible, touched 77%((i77%c. The
heavy primary receipts and lack of outside
support caused a reaction and the close was
weak. May J ,4@"4c down at 77c.
Corn was dull but fairly steady, although the
crowd kept a close eye on wheat and ran at
small losses. Uncertainty over the weather,
which at present Is not favorable to the move
ment, had a steadying effect, although It was
reported that country holders were preparing
to rush large quantities to market, the car
supply having become more nearly adequate.
The grade of corn being received shows no
Improvement. . May closed '/ic lower at 38V4C?
There was a narrow market for oats and the
trade was bare of features â¢ in a speculative
way. although there continued to be a good
cash demand. The movement from first hands ;
continued liberal, but desirable grades were
hard to get. May closed VÂ»c lower at 24%c.
Provisions were quiet and steady. The open-
Ing was higher In sympathy with higher prices
at the yards, followed by a further bulge on
the good cash demand. Prices reacted from the
top on realizing by scalpers, but the close was
steady. May pork closed 2Vic higher, May lard

selves like veterans. Under the tutelage
of Captain Harden and Lieutenant Reth

have attained a remarkable degree of pro

SEATTLE. Jan. 15.â The United States

The Perry sailed again this afternoon to
cruise southward and resume her quest.
The Andrada Â¦was last heard of on De

the Columbia River bar, waiting for a
chance to cross in. On that day she took
aboard Captain Cordiner, the pilot- .This
was the last erer heard of the vessel, with
the exception of one story brought Into
San Kranclsco by the schooner Bertha
Dolbeer, which reported having sighted a
ship much like the Andrada.

put to sea in search of the Andrada. Cap
tain Kilgore says that the weather along
the coast is still very severe and that a

storm. The Sight and Light was towed
down last Thursday and came back and
anchored in Crescent harbor, wrhere she
was still lying Saturday. \ ,-v

Revenue Cutter Perry Reports Its
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.â Solicitor Gen
eral Richards to-day made reply to Mr.
Smith's argument in the Hawaiian insular
case, now being heard before the United
States Supreme Court. In this case, he
said, it was obviously the intention of
Congress, as soon as practicable, to treat
the territory as part of the United States
for legislative purposes, so that the rev
enue and commercial laws which apply
In the United States should operate there.
"But," he went on, "before these laws
could be put in operation in the Hawaiian
Islands it was necessary that a period of
preparation should, intervene after the
passage of the resolution of annexation.
On July 7, 1898, when the main resolution
was passed, there were no customs laws
of the* United States in operation in Ha
waii and no customs of the United States
there. The customs^ laws of the republic
of Hawaii were in force, and they were
the only laws of that character. It Is
obvious, therefore, that If the resolution
of annexation immediately abrogated the
customs . laws of the islands the terri
tory would have been left without any
customs law, open to the ships of the
world. The customs laws of the United
States could not have effective operation
because there were no agencies . there to
enforce 'them. If, then, the resolution qt
annexation threw open the ports of Ha
waii to the world at the same time, ac
cording to the contention of opposing
counsel, it threw open the portB of the
United States to ships coming, from Ha
waii. The effect of this would have been
to give an open' door through Hawaiian
ports into ours. We could not Inquire,
when goods came into the United States
from Hawaii, whether they had been
brought into* Hawaii as an entry port to
the United States."
Mr. Richards argued that this sort of
thing could not be permitted, and he ex
pressed the opinion, that if Congress had
believed that such a consequence would
ensue' the resolution of annexation would
not have passed when it: did. nor until
arrangements could have -been . made to
put in operation our customs and com
merce regulations Immediately. So far as
customs matters | are concerned evidently
the islands . were not to be deemed part
of âe United States for customs purposes

until Congress could further legislate In
the matter by a law extending the United
States customs laws and regulations to
the islands. He called attention to the
act of annexation, saying that it did not
make the Hawaiian Islands a part of the
United States, but. a part of the territory
of the United States. "It is," he said,
"obvious that territory annexed or ceded
to the United States becomes a part of
the territory of the United States, but it
does not become ' a part of the United
States in either a constitutional or legis
lative sense until Congress shall so deter
mine." . ,
In conclusion; Mr. Richards said: "In
the annexation resolution It was express
ly provided that the customs regulations
of the republic of Hawaii should continue
until Congress should extend the customs
laws of the United States to the islands.
It was not until the passage of the act
of April 30, 1900. that the islands became
a part of the United States for customs
purposes by the extension of our laws to
them." -

Yesterday afternoon John Bell and Mrs.
Sere, the latter the married sister of the
dead girl, went to the Morgue to look at
the body. Indignantly they asked If there
were no law to punish the man who by
her own admissions had driven the girl to
the acid viaL "If there is no law by
which Blum can be punished I'll attend to
him," cried John Bell. "Either he or I
will occupy a slab here before many day3
are out." With this Bell and Mrs. Sere.

Florence Bell loved not wisely, but too
well, and when she foiAd that Blum,
whom she had known for some time, was
married, the blow was a bitter one. She
had auestioned Mrs. Sere about it. and
Mrs. Sere had told her that they could
never marry while Blum's wife lived. On
Sunday night the girl went out presum
ably with Blum, and it is thought they
quarreled, as she was gloomy all the next
day. When night came she took her life,
and her brother swears to have the blood
of the man who brought her to death.

The three suits brought to test the con
stitutionality and legality of the pro
visions of the charter pertaining to civil
service were argued yesterday before the
Supreme Court, sitting in bank. At tha
conclusion of the argument the cases were
taken under advisement. It is expected
that a decision will be shortly handed
down, as the matters involved In the cases
prevent the Civil Service Commissioners
from performing all the duties of their
office. The Commissioners are at present
enjoined from holding examinations for
clerks and deputies in several depart
ments of the government. Until such time
as the Supreme Court passes on the ques
tion of the constitutionality of the pro
visions of the charter relating to thes<Â»
departments, the offices will be filled with
employes who have bten appointed by
the heads of the departments Involved.
The first case argued was that of Crow
ley vs Freud. In which Judge Hebbard
decided against the defendant, who i3
a member of thÂ« commission. The suit.
was brought by Crowley. suing as a tax
payer to restrain the Auditor and Treas
urer from paying the salaries of the Com
missioners on the ground that the corn
mission is an Illegally constituted body.
The point Involved is that certain office*
in the municipal government come under
the provisions of the county government
act and as such are not bound and re
stricted by the provisions of the charter.
City and County Attorney Lane and Gar
ret McEnerney appeared for the appel
lants and John Garber and Isaac Frohman
for Crowley. __ â
The other two suits. Cahen vs. Weils
and Bauer vs. Qulnn, attack the validity
and constitutionality of all of the pro
visions of the charter relating to civil
service P. F. Dunne, who represented
the contestants against Auditor Wells
and Commissioner Quinn argued that the
provisions of section 12 of the article re
lating to civil service were in violation of
the constitution. Â¦ . < Â¦
City Attorney Lane and Attorney Mc-
Enerney took a broader view of the cas<*
ind argued that if the section complained
of 'was invalid there was no law to show
that the whole article of the charter re
latin* to civil service must necessarily
fall They denied that the constitution
was violated either in the spirit or letter
of the law as laid down by the charter.

Sections of Charter â¢

SERVICE SUITS
FEARING the threatened venge
ance of John Bell, brother of the
girl he had wronged, Robert
Blum, who is said to be the man
whose changed demeanor toward
Florence Bell drove her to suicide, is
thought to have fled. Inquiry at his late
residence, 2S0O Greenwich street, last night
revealed the fact that, contrary to his
usual custom, he had not put in an ap
pearance there the entire day, nor up to
a late hour was there any sign of him.
In the quartermaster's department at the
Presidio, where -he was employed as
plumber, nothing had been seen of him,
and It Is thought that he has sought ref
uge In some other part of the State from
the family of Florence Bell.
That the board realized Its mistake In
rescinding one of the rules In violation of
eectlons 12 and 13 was shown some time
ago. At one of its meetings a resolution
was adopted amending section 53 by fixing
the number of days during which a teach
er must be absent before detailing a sub
stitute In her place at one day instead of
five. The board realized its error, and at
the next meeting the resolution was re
scinded. Due notice was then .given of
the proposed amendment and a new reso
lution on the subject adopted at the next
meeting.
Principal Morton of the Lowell High
School applied yesterday for a teacher in
Latin ana history. There is no teacher
at present available who can specialize
on these two subjects, and the board will
not make the assignment until a suitable
pedagogue is found.
No resolution temporarily suspending
the operation of section 90 appears on the
minutes of the board. When the advisa
bility of doing away with home study as
an experiment was first discussed by the
board the matter was left to Director Kln
caid with full power to act. This was
done at one of the secret sessions for
which the boarfcs and commissions of the
Phelan administration are dubiously
famous. The matter was never brought
up at a regular open meeting of the
board, and legal action has therefore
never been taken.
Bee. 12. Any rules adopted by the board may
be amended or repealed by the affirmative vt>t*
of three members at any meeting, provided
notice In writing of such intended amendment
or repeal has been given at a previous meet
ing.
Sec. 13. Any rule of the board may be sus
pended by an affirmative vote of three mem
bers thereof.
The only legal way in which this section
could be amended so as to exclude one
school from Its provisions would be in
the manner prescribed by sections 12 and
13 of the "Rules of Order," which eay:
To pupils of the eighth grade not more than
cne and a half hours' home study.
In temporarily prohibiting home study
among pupils of the Broadway Grammar
School the Board of Education has fla
grantly violated one of Its own rules. The
Innovation has been Introduced as an ex
periment to determine whether pupils who
have no home study will "equal or sur
pass in scholarship those who study the
prescribed time. Comparison will be made
with other classes, where home study will
continue as in the past. In order to show
that the board has acted illegally in do
ing away with home study In the Broad
way school it is only necessary to direct
attention to two sections of the rules reg
ularly adopted In July of last year. Sec
tion 90. on "Home Study" in the grammar
grades, reads as follows:
Section 90. Lessons for home study shall be
regulated as fellows:
To pupils ot the fifth, sixth and seventh
CTammar grades, not more than one hour's
Home Study for Pupils of
Broadway School Ille
gally Abolished.
BOARD VIOLATES
ITS OWN RULES
OAKLAND, Jan. 15.â Katherine
Kittleman, leading lady of the
"Old Jed Prouty" company, in
which her husband, Richard Gol
den, plays the title role, slapped
the face and pulled the hair of Miss Al
freda Healy, said to be a Montana mil
lionaire's daughter, at the Macdonough
Theater last night. The incident was un
witnessed save by the three persons
named, because it occurred in a narrow
passageway leading from the lower right
side boxes to a private entrance to the â¢
stage. The attack of the angered wife
was the culmination of her rising wrath,
which reached boiling point because ot
Richard's evident attentions to the pretty
blonde from Montana, who was occupying
one of "the stage boxes. On the opposite
side of the proscenium was Mrs. Golden,
ensconced in another box, and she watoh
ed and watched until her husband's "goo
goo" actions aroused her fury.
Deliberately walking over to the nar
row alleyway Mrs. Golden found her hus
band, in his stage make-up, in busy con
verse with the fair haired beauty. He had
taken advantage of a few moments off
the stage to call upon the box occupant,
who seemed nothing loth to receive the
flattering attentions from the actor. But
the little tete-a-tete was rudely interrupt
ed with the appearance of Mrs. Golden,
who demanded explanations. There were
some angry words from the husband, a
flouting remark from his vis-a-vis, and
then the maddened wife slapped Mlsa
Healy Bquarely upon her fair countenance.
The play was progressing, but the dis
turbance, which could be plainly heard,
though not seen, distracted, audience and
actors. Attendants of the theater, with
Manager RodolDh of the company, inter
fered: then the trio of combatants were
hustled behind the wings. As soon as the
curtain dropped on the last act the war
was resumed on the stage. Mrs. Golden
and Miss Healy met and explanations
were attempted. Manager Rodolph tried
to play peacemaker, but when the end
came the exasperated wife went back to
San Francisco and Golden ordered her'
discharged from the company. Miss
Healy disappeared, and It is reported has
gone to San Francisco to await the blow-
Ing over of the storm.
Golden professes to have been much
abused, but Mrs. Golden insists that she
had great provocation for her act that
was not in the lines of "Old Jed Prouty."
She had not been playing with the com
pany for two weeks because of illness, for
which ehe was under treatment at the
Waldeck Sanatorium, across the bay.
Mrs Golden ' explained to-day that she
had heard stories of her husband's con
duct, which came with such frequency

trunks of oftVisls or others are landed
Â¦without examination. He says that as &â¢

eays that the Customs Surveyor causes

a hand in the game yesterday by dismiss
ing two smuggling cases and scoring the
Surveyor for dÂ«scrimina.tlng between big
and little smugglers.
The cases were those of Dr. Holmes,
Furseon of the Government transport
Grant and his clerk. A. Milthrop. They
Â¦w-pre arrested for smuggling a bolt of
eilk. Dr. Holme* testified in his own case
that he was stopped on the gangway and
informed by Customs Inspector Enlow
that he would be obliged to pay duty on
th* p'.'.k. He accordingly gave it to Mil
throp. with instructions to place it In a

declined to testify against the doctor, and
efter Inspector Enlow had told about the
doctor whispering into Mllthrop's ear
when he gave him the 6ilk. and about
llilthrop trying to get off the Bteamer
wlÂ«h the silk concealed under his over
coat ' Milthrop'? case wae taken up. Mll
thro? swore that the doctor had ordered

President Wheeler has been gone Juat
a month and brings back much Important
information as to the future of the uni
versity, including plans for the first new
building under Mrs. Hearst's plans. Con
tinuing he said: "While East an Investi
gation was carried on concerning the
choice of an architect for university plane.
Mrs. Hearst is anxious to go ahead with
the erection of the mining building under
the Benard scheme. We consulted the
leading architects in Boston and New
York concerning the course which the
university might best pursue. We have
considered the desirability of securing a
Fuperviping architect, who shall have
charge and overeight of all the buildings
under the Benard plans, and who may
himself plan one or more of the individual
buildings. If one of the five successful
competitors of the Hearst competition
could be chosen such a solution of thÂ«
problem would be most acceptable to all
S'ecotiations are in progress which we
hop* will load to such an outcome.
â¢The bill for the support of mining
schools has passed the United States Sen
ate and the House Committee ana needs
onlv the action of the Committee on Rules
tn 1-x? broucht hofore the House, where it
Â¦will almost certainly pass. The committee,
however, seems to be unfavorable at
present.

"While in Washington." said Dr.
"Wheeler, "I visited the President and ex
tended an invitation to him to be present
end take part in the university com
mencement exercises. The invitation was
accepted by President McKinley, contin
gent upon the possibility of arranging the
programme of the trip. The President
expressed his hope that nothing would
deter him from attending the exercises.
Nearly the entire Cabinet will accompany
President McKiAey on his trip. The
party expects to be In San Francisco
from about the 15th to the 19th of May.
The exact programme cannot be arrangeJ
until after the inauguration ceremonies
have been completed."
BERKELEY. Jan. 15.-Presldent Ben
jamin Ide 'Wheeler arrived to-night from
tbm East, bringing with, him the Informa
tion that President McKInley will attend
i he commencement exercises at the Uni
versity of California on May 16.
Several prominent Eastern educators
have been engaged to teach at the univer
sity summer school. An announcement of
those secured will be made in two or three
days. President Wheeler, In speaking of
State affairs, said: "So far as I know at
present I shall not attend the Legislature
at Sacramento. I have not yet read Gov
ernor Gage's recommendations regarding
the university, but I believe him to have
the best interests of it and State at
heart." ' 0
'â¢There are many difficulties connected
with the business arrangements, particu
larly regarding the price for the use of
the plates and regarding the right of the
board to enter into a contract for a period
of years, say five. It is so important for
the State that something should be done
something real and practical â that the
matter should now be pushed to a con
clusion and the board given the necessary
power to see the matter through. The
whole question will be brought up at the
next meeting of the State Board of Edu
cation, which is to be called at an early
day. This much has been discovered, that
there is nothing absolutely Impossible
about the project. It will require, how
ever, for its successful outcome the hearty
co-operation of all the friends of educa
tion."
President Wheeler denies absolutely that
he was called to the presidency of Har
vard I'nlversity or that he ever expects
to be called there.
tlon to provide the â¢ichools of California
with an improved series of State text
books. The problem Is to find out what
can be done to Improve our system of
textbooks under the existing laws. A re
cent decision of Attorney General Fort
confirms the opinion of the State Board
of Education that under the existing pro
visions of the constitution the board has
the right to acquire the ifte of textbook*
now on the list of the school book pub
lishers, the" same to be printed at the
State Printing Office, and thence distrib
uted to the schools. It has been a ques
tion whether the publishers would con
sent to any such arrangement In any form
whatever. The wbol* proceeding Is a
novel one from the publishers' point of
view. After a careful consideration th<9
publishers prove to be not entirely ad
verse to attempting the experiment. They
are not. Indeed, willing to dispose of copy
rights, but they would probably be will
ing, provided proper business arrange
ments could be concluded, to do one or
two things: Firstâ To permit the use of
duplicate sets of plates on the basis of a
royaltv or; second â to furnish sheets to
be made into books at the State Printing
Office.

It is* curious to observe how hard It is
for some people to give up coffee drinking
after they have ber-ome at least half sat-
Iffled that it is th* cause of their 111
health, but It becomes an easy task to
jrive It up when ore takes Postum Food
Coffee in it* place, providing, of course,
that Postum is made according to direc-
tion?, for then It has the rich, beautiful
color and a satisfying taste, while the
rapid improvement in health clinches the
erpumpnt.
A younff lady at Cambrid geport. Mass.,
prvb: "When it was shown to me plainly
that my ill health an . excessive nervoua-
ress was largely due to the coffee habit I
realised that I must give it up. but It was
next to impossible to do so. However, I
made the trial and took Postum Food Cof-
fee, with the mental reservation of the
"privilege." as I termed It, of drinking cof-
fee once a week. V-
"Little did I dream what a true friend
Postum was declined to . :ome to me.
The old stomach trouble left, the nervous-
nesf vanished and good, natural, healthy
elrep came to my relief. In less than i :
months T felt like cjiothcr person. I was
so well and happy.
"The "reserve privilege* In regard to
using regular coffee was thrown to the
wlnde. I have not the slightest desire for
It: In fact. I very much prefer my Postum
to any coffee."

and trustees of the Pacific Bank took place
yesterday. The most Important news to
be submitted referred to the success of
the bank over Captain McDonald. Judge
Sawyer headed a ticket for directors for
the ensuing term and he was elected, his
associates being R. P. Clement, Daniel
G. Dexter, Thomas James Stanton, George
Childs. Theodore H. Hatch. J. Howard
Bernard and Charles T. Lott. With the
exception of Messrs. Sawyer, Coggswell
and Lott, this is a new board. Judge
Sawyer was elected president and attor
ney and R. P. Clement secretary. Daniel
Meyer's bank was again made the depos
itory of the bank. The monthly expenses
were pared down to $135. The attorney
will receive $100 per month Instead of $150
and the secretary will have a salary of
$25 per month.
Only one thing stands In the way of
declaring another dividend to the depos
itors of the Pacific Bank. The bank has
$75,000 In cash on hand. Judge E. D. Saw
yer, who Is at once attorney and presi
dent, said yesterday that there is a case
pending which Involves $45,000. Dr. Mc-
Donald has Judgment against the bank
for that amount, but the Supreme Court
of the State has Just reversed a judgment
in favor of Captain "Jim" McDonald for
$72,900 in a case where the issue was the
same as the one In Dr. McDonald's suit.
Consequently Judge Sawyer thinks that
there is little doubt that the $45,000 will
remain for the payment of a dividend, In
addition to Captain "Jim" McDonald's
money.
Depositors Hope to Realize

Court.

No man in tho State of California was
better or more widely known than the late
Coroner. He stood high in his profession
and had much more than a local reputa
tion as a gynecologist; in fact, he was an
acknowledged authority on obstetrics ahd
diseases of women. As a bon vlvant and
raconteur he was the life of the club
meetings and medical societies with which
he was connected. Of high character for
lntej^rity and devotion to duty, he com
manded the respect and admiration of all
who knew him, and notwithstanding his
necessarily busy and worldly life he was
a man of deep religious feeling.
He said to a friend a few weeks ago
that it had been his practice since his
early childhood to kneel at his bedside
and pray every night before retiring. A
few months ago, on the occasion of his
retiring from the chair of obstetrics and
grynecology in the medical department of
the University of California, he was pre
sented by the claBs and faculty with a
series of complimentary resolutions en
graved upon a solid silver plate. This gift
he esteemed more highly than any of his
other possessions.
Dr. Cole held several Inquests lasl Fri
day which occupied the greater part of
the day. and he appeared to be very
much fatigued and complained of pains
about the heart. He remarked to Deputy
Coroner McCormick at that time that he
would never return to the office, but as
he had made similar remarks on former
occasions no importance was attached to
his words.
It was found that one side of his face had
become partially paralyzed. This caused
an impediment in his speech which wor
ried him considerably. Since that time he
had never been a well man and often suf
fered from pains in the region of his
heart.
DR. RICHARD BEVERLY COLE,

donations made by the board during the
last year, which amounted to $231 50.
Milton S. Latham, secretary of the San

Officer Blrdsall, who was accused by a
citizen of Infringing upon his rights, was
acquitted -of the charee.
Final action was taken last eveninsr by
the Police Commissioners at their meet
ing in regard to the proposed change In
the hours x>t policemen's watches. By a
unanimous* vote of the board It was de
cided that the eight-hour watch, with an
unbroken rest, would enable the patrol
men to better perform their duties. Chief
Sullivan was Instructed to forward to the
Board of Supervisors a memorial asking
that the force be increased by 176 men in
order that the new plan may be carried
out. With the number of officers now on
duty any plan other than that now in use
would not be practicable.
Numerous applications for , liquor
licenses were received, thÂ» majority of
which were .granted. Several saloon
keepers were granted renewals, but only
on condition that they make a change in
their methods of conducting their places

The police ridicule the statements made
by the attorney and still hold that Glaze
shot down his partner deliberately and
that. the account of the shooting given by
the bellboy, O'Connor, Is true in every re
spect, being substantiated by the location
of the wounds on the dead man's body.
Photographs and diagrams of the Wind
sor Hotel kitchen were made yesterday by
Detective McMahon for use at the trial of
Glaze.
Attorney Brown declined to say what
reason Trewhella had for making threats
against Glaze.
Attorney Brown stated yesterday that
at the trial he would produce witnesses to
show that Trewhella had often threatened
the life of Glaze. He asserts that these
threats were made many times and that
on Monday morning the threats were re
peated. Fearing for his life. Glaze, when
he went downtown, took his revolver to
a store on Market street and*had It re
paired, at the same time purchasing
cartridges for It.
O'Connor, the bellboy, who witnessed
the shooting, yesterday made a detailed
statement to Captain Seymour of the oc
currence by which Trewhella met a vio
lent death.
Mrs. Trewhella, the wife of the murdered
man, arrived from Auburn last evening.
She was met at the depot by her son,
Robert Kendall. The meeting of mother
and son 'was an affecting one and the un
fortunate woman was prostrated with
grief. Her son escorted her to the Wind
sor Hotel, where she was placed In bed.
No one was allowed to see her and it was
learned that she was In a. state of physi
cal and mental collapse. Captain of De
tectives Seymour was expecting Mrs.
Trewhella at his office, but Detective Cody
telephoned in that it was impossible for
her to make the trip down.
Yesterday morning Glaze was taken into
the court of Police Judge Conlan. where
his case was called. Judge Conlan in
structed Glaze as to his rights and Assist
ant District Attorney Weller asked that
the case go over for a 'week. Attorney
Brown objected, but quickly consented
when the prosecuting officer announced
that he would go on with the case. Glaze
was remanded Into custody until next
Tuesday.
Dr. Leland yesterday performed an au
topsy on the body of Trewhella. It dis
closed that one bullet had entered the
left shoulder, four inches below the apex,
passing forward and downward to the
right, around the chest wall and lodging
in the cavity. A second bullet entered
four inches below the point of the left
shoulder blade, passing forward and to
the right and lodging in the deep muscles
of the neck. A third entered at the base
of the spine and lodged in the bony struc
ture of the backbone. Two bullets en
tered the front of Trewhella's body Jn a
radius of one and a quarter inches. One
bullet entered three-quarters of an inch to
the right of the median line and two and
a quarter inches below the nipple. It
passed directly downward to the back and
to the right, lodging in the muscles of
the small of the back. The other bullet
entered half an Inch to the left of the
median line and two and five-eighths
Inches below the nipple, passing down
ward and to the left, fracturing the
eleventh rib. The wounds caused by tho
two last mentioned bullets were powder
marked. The cause of death â¢was given
by Dr. Leland as shock and hemorrhage,
due to gunshot wounds. Trewhella's
body was removed last evening from the
Morgue to an undertaking parlor on Mis
sion street.
Attorneys and Brown have
secured the services of W. W. Foote and
the latter gentleman had a long consulta
tion with his client in the prison at the
Hall of Justice. Mrs. Glaze also called
upon her husband, but she positively re
fui-ed to discuss the case.
"I will not talk about his statement,"
said Glaze as he nervously chewed a
toothpick; "my attorney may have some
thing to say. however, for me. When
the time comes I will talk and produce my
witnesses to show that I acted in self
defense."
While Glaze and his attorneys claim
that this admission will show that the
accused man feared violence at the hajids
of Trewhella, the police assert that the
admission made by Glaze shows premedi
tation to use the pistol in the manner
which ended in Trewhella's death.
A night in prison had a visible effect on
Glaze and when he was seen yesterday by
a reporter of The Call, he trembled like a
leaf when questioned as to the statement
made by O'Connor, the bellboy, who was
an eye-witness to the shooting.
Robert E. Glaze, who killed his part
ner, William Trewhella, at the Windsor
Hotel on Monday afternoon, yesterday ad
mitted, through his attorney, I. I. Brown,
that on the morning of the tragedy he had
his revolver repaired and purchased a
number of cartridges for the weapon.

to Virginia City a few years later, but he
did not remain there long.
On his return here he engaged in the
liquor business, and later on, when Buck
ley was coming to the front as a political
leader, opened a saloon with him on Bush
street, between Montgomery and Kearny.
streets. Buckley made his headquarters
in the saloon, and when he secured con
trol of the reins of the local Democracy
the partnership thrived. With the decline
of Buckley's power as a boss came the
decline of the saloon, and it soon became
a source of loss instead of profit.
After retiring from the saloon business
Fallon secured employment as a deputy
in the new City Hall. The last steady
political position held by him was that of
deputy during the administration of Sher-
L ff Whelan. The only blood relation he
had living is Mrs. James D. Leary. the
wire of a rich and influential contractor
of Isew York City.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16, 1901.
The expectation of winning against Dr.
McDonald in the Supreme Court depends
on the failure of the Pacific Bank direc
tors, Â¦when the bank was incorporated un
der the act of 1862, to provide that a
stockholder in liquidation might recover
money deposited by him in the bank on
even terms with other depositors who
were not stockholders. Captain McDon
ald was a depositor and stockholder. Dr.
McDonald is in the same position. Cap
tain McDonald has failed to recover by
the decision of the Supreme Court. Alto
gether Captain McDonald has lost some
thing like $120,000 by judgment against
him in the Pacific Bank litigation. Just
when the Dr. McDonald case will be
reached on appeal in the Supreme Court
is uncertain. The dividend that is based
on the expectancy will be one of 5 per
cent.
