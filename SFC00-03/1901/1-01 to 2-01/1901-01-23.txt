The news was received with the greatest sorrow at Balmoral, Windsor -and ; Eton, where
Queen Victoria was regarded in a specially personal manner by the inhabitants. ..
Princess Beatrice telegraphed the tidings to former Empress Eugenie at Farnsborough.
[â¢ An incident characteristic of the Queen's solicitude for others occurred two; days ago,
when, in one of the intervals of consciousness, she summoned strength to suggest to her dressers
'who had been acting as nurses to take the opportunity of getting some fresh air. Monday she
asked that her little Pomeranian spaniel be brought*to her bedroom.
It was thought that the Queen was dying about 9 in the morning, arid carriages were
sent to Osborne Cottage and the rectory to bring all the Princes and Princesses and the Bishop
of Winchester to her bedside. It seemed then very near the end, but when things looked the
worst the Queen had one of the rallies due to her wonderful constitution, opened her eyes and rec
ognized the Prince of Wales, the Princesses and Emperor William. She asked to see one of her
faithful servants, a member of the household. He hastened to the room, but before he got there
the Queen had passed into a fitful sleep.
Four o'clock marked the beginning of the end. Again the family were summoned, and this
time the relapse was not followed by recovery.
The Prince of Wales was very much affected when the doctors at last informed him that
his mother had breathed her last. Emperor William, himself deeply affected, did his best to min
ister comfort to his sorrow-stricken uncle, whose new dignity he was the first to. acknowledge.
From all parts of the world there are still pouring into Cowes messages of condolence. They
come from crowned heads, millionaires, tradesmen and paupers, and are variously addressed to the
Prince of Wales and the King of England.
Emperor William's arrangements are not settled. His yacht will arrive here to-day (Wed
nesday), but it is believed that he will not depart until after the funeral. Several other royal per
sonages are likely to be present at the function. â¢
The record of the last days of the reign of Victoria is not easy to tell. Forseveral weeks the
Queen had been failing. On Monday week she summoned Lord Roberts and ; asked him some
very searching questions regarding, the war in South Africa. . OnTuesday she went for,a drive, but
was visibly affected. On Wednesday she suffered a paralytic stroke, accompanied by intense phy
sical weakness. It was her first illness in all her eighty-one years and she would, not admit it.
Then her condition grew so serious that, against her. wishes, the family were summoned. When
they arrived her reason had practically succumbed to paralysis and weakness. \
The events of the last days, described in the bulletins, are too fresh to neetl repetition. At
the lodge gates the watchers waited nervously.. Suddenly along the drive from the house came a
horseman who <yied "The Queen is dead" as he dashed through the crowds..
Then down the hillside rushed a myriad of messengers, passing the fateful bulletin from
one to another. Soon the surrounding country knew that a King ruled over Great Britain. The
local inhabitants walked as if in a dream through the streets of Cowes, but they , did not hesitate
4o stop to drink the health of the new monarch. :, â¢ , VV'-V. -IU
The end of this career, never equaled by any woman 'in the world's history, came in
a simply furnished room in Osborne House. This most respected of women, living or dead, lay in
a great four-posted bed and made a shrunken atom whose aged face and figure were a cruel
mockery of the fair girl who in 1837 began to rule over England.
Around her were gathered almost every descendant of her line. Well within view of her
dying eyes there hung a portrait of the Prince Consort. It was he who designed the room and
every part of the castle. In scarcely audible words the white-haired Bishop, of Winchester prayed
beside her as he had often prayed with his sovereign, for he was her, chaplain at Windsor. With
bowed heads the imperious ruler of the German empire and the man who is now King of Eng
land, the woman who has succeeded to the title of Queen, the Princes and Princesses and those of
less than royal designation, listened to the Bishop's prayer. ..
Six o'clock passed. The Bishop continued his intercession. One of the younger children
asked a question in shrill, childish treble and was immediately silenced. The women "of this royal '
family sobbed faintly and the men shuffled uneasily.
At exactly half-past 6 Sir James Reid held up his head and the people Â¦â¢ then knew that.
England had lost her Queen. The Bishop pronounced the benediction.
The Queen passed away quite peacefully. She suffered no pain. Those who '^vere now
mourning went to their rooms. A few minutes later the inevitable element, of materialism stepped
into this pathetic chapter of international history, for the court ladies went busily to work order
ing their mourning from London. .
The wheels cf the world were jarred when the announcement came, but in this palace at
Osborne everything pursued the usual course. Down in the kitchen they were cooking a huge din- .
ner for. an assemblage the like of which has, seldom been-r-knownanEnglaiid.andtlladitinerprep-*:

' The body of Queen Victoria was embalmed and probably will be taken to Windsor on Sat
urday. The coffin arrived last evening from London.

. Formal notice of the Queen's death was
communicated by Lord Pauncefote to the
President through Secretary Hay this
afternoon. It contains the simple an
nouncement of the fact of death as sent
to the Embassador by Lord Lansdowne,
the British Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs.
Lord Pauncefote had expected that the
end ctfuld not be long deferred and had
been prepared for the sad intelligence
that the Queen was no more; but It came
lo Ifim almost as a personal affliction, for
It was only a few months ago that he
was the guest of the Queen at Osborne,
When he received from her hands his ele
vation to the peerage. Aside from this
the Queen had frequently shown most
gracious consideration to the Embassador
and Lady Pauncefote. Inviting them to
Windsor and to Osborne for visits which
were something more than brief official
exchanges. On the last occasion when
Lord Pauncrfote saw the Queen she was
in excellent health, considering her years.
and her mental faculties were keen and
observant.

Secretary Hay cabled the following mes
sage to Embassador Choate at London:
President McKinley's message of con

as news of the Queen'a death was re

f-nd ha<1 h~en disposed o f and all was In

ftirs which are 'ndispensable to such
events. While the Cabinet was in session
during the noon hour the President and
hip advisors were In receipt from time to
time of all the news which came, from
Osbome House, po when the end came
later in the afternoon It found appropriate
messajrrp of condolence framed and even
orderâ¢ ready for execution looking to the
half-masting of the flags over the execu
tive departments ami the carrying out of
the usual formalities. The half-masting
of the national ensign , was an unusual
tribute to the memory of the deceased
sovereign. It Is said this has been done
rarely upon the occasion of the funeral
<if some great world's ruler, but never
before in the case of the death of a
monarch.
The actual dispatch of the messages
from the President to the new" King and
from Secretary Hay to Embassador
Ohoate was delayed only long: enough to
receive the physicians' statement an
nouncing the demise of the Queen and
th'-n thf y were pent forward at once and
copies wero given to the press. The Brit

as of full worth and the royal standard
flyinp over the embassy building was per
haps the first in Washington to sink
slowly half way down the tall staff, giv
ing notice to official Washington of the
sad event. The rapidity with which the
news spread was remarkable and within
a short half hour the members of the dip
lomatic body here began to appear at
the British embassy, bearing cards of con
dolence. Another unusual mark of the
liiph appreciation of the worth of the de
ceased Queen was the action taken by
the House of Representatives In adjourn

widespread expressions of
deepest regret, all classes and
nationalities joining In the
sympathy called forth by
' the passing of Britain's
great sovereign. The first Intima

when the American flag was placed
at half-mast on the flag pole sur

Spreckels tfuilding and the posting of the
death bulletin in the business office of Tha
Call.
Within a few minutes the word was
passed that Queen Victoria was dead and
crowds congregated around the newspa

their ensigns. At the ferry building tho
sign of mourning was displayed, and
when word was conveyed to Adjutant
General Babcock of the United States
Army, at army headquarters In the Phe
lan building, that the Queen was dead,
he ordered the flag over the building to
be lowered. On the school houses the flag
was displayed at half-mast and the vari
ous foreign consuls did not wait for offi
cial news of the death of the Queen to
show the tame mark of respect.
British Consul W. Clayton Plckersgtll
said last evening that he had not yet re
: ceived official notification of the death
;of his sovereign, but accepted the press
dispatches In lieu of official Information.
The Union Jack hung at half-mast over
the British Consulate and during the day
many persons called at the consulate to
express their regrets and sympathy. The
first to call was the German Consul, and
he was followed by other foreign repre
sentatives. All the consulates displayed
flags at half-mast and In Chinatown the
same rule was observed by the leading
business men and by Chinese Consul Gen
eral Ho Yow.

INDIANAPOLIS. Jan. 22.â When noti
fied of the Queen'a death .to-day Ben
jamin Harrison made this statement:
"No other death could have excited so
general a sorrow. There are persona In
every nationâ other than Great Britain â
whose death would more profoundly move
the people of that nation, but Queen Vic
toria's death will briny more sadness to
the hearts of more men and women than
any other. The drumbeat did not define
her dominion; the Union, Jack was not
the symbol of her large empire. More
hearts pulsated with love for her and
more knees bowed before her queenly per
sonality than before the Queen of Great
Britain. 'God Save the Queen* . hadv be
come well nigh a universal anthem.
Heredity does not stay our quest for the
real man or woman upon whose head a
crown has* fallen. 'Indeed, that has coma
to be the way of the world. . The sover
eign whose life is not clean, "noble, lyra
pa the tic: whose personal character la be
low the best thoughts of his people, is not
loved, and the powers of an. unloved King
or Queen are short, however may the law
run. Â¦ Queen Victoria's power was lat/ger
than the law. ~
"I do not* care to speculate as to. the
effect of the Queen's death upon Euro
pean politics further than to say that a
mighty influence* on the side of peace has
been lost- -The' British people will find
.It hard to adjust their mind* and hearts
Jo a juccesslon. There will be a dispo
sition to make the pause unusually long
after the first member of the proclama
tion The Queen Is Dead.' but the other
member Will follow, and *LonÂ«r Live the
King* will be spoken resolutely by Brit
ons everywhere.
â¢The new sovereign will bÂ« loyally sup
ported In his constitutional prerogatives,
and will not be denied an opportunity to
win that dominion over the hearts of his
people which they yielded to "his mother."

"In my opinion there hns been no politi
cal bond that has bound together the Brit
ish empire with more power, "if as muci:,
as the bond of personal devotion to this
beautiful character and personality. I
was much struck on my. recent trip
around the world to Observe the extent to
which this extreme personal devotion was
noticeable. People who had never seen
the Queen, had never been to England and
never had expected to be, appeared to feel
the same personal devotion as English
men themselves. The attraction and co
hesive force of this sentiment upon colo
nial life was very remarkable. It greatly
impressed me. and a s I- said, " It ; appears
to have been the strongest bond that has
held the empire together." 'Â¦'..' . â¢
Bishop Potter said that If he should at
tempt to estimate 'the character of the
Queen it would simply be upon the same
lines as he ufced In his address to students
and young men at Calvary Church Sun
day night. He then laid emphasis upon
thelnct that Victoria was like Washing
ton, because it was the nobility of her
character rather than' other conspicuous
gifts of intellect that won for her such
universal esteem. They had been the
most successful- rulers- of their respective
nations and yet neither had possessed any
such shining talents as those with whom
Napoleon dazzled the world. Bishop Pot
ter also said:

NEJV\ YORK. Jan. 22.â The first appar
ent en>ct in New York City of the cable
gram from England announcing the death

stant lowering of flaps all over the city
to half mast. , This was particularly true
with regard to the financial district, where
every business house or building had Its
bunting ready. Wall street and Its adja
cent thoroughfares Â¦were soon given silent
Intimation that one of 4 the world's most
notable personages had parsed away.
Trinity Church, at the head of Wall
street, took note of the event by the toll-
Inpr-of its b*>ll. and possibly the first offi

Gives It to Assembly in Its Entirety,
We have a problem before us. I wlgh I could
nay that I could see Just where the end would
be, or rather I will say I am grlad I do not see
it. That university Is going to grow, I know,
to be a very great institution. I do not know
but that it Is groins: to be the first instltution-
In the world as It stands looking out upon the
Pacific, with problems which that â¢ university
has got to deal with, and we have come to aslt
help of the people of the State of California. ..
That institution is going: to be the great force
reaching out its hand to the lands of the Occi
dent, to the Far Kafit. Within a generation
China will be opened up, and there will be col
leges built In every district. The first lot of
Mandarins has come to us already, asking for
Occidental ' education, at Berkeley. .Â¦Â¦.: We expect
more in this line. It is natural that they should
come ot us. These boys who came from, the
Philippines represent leading families of the
Tagalos, and ask us to educate them. This has
not come about by any artificial means. It Is
natural. It Is a privilege that-the commission
has asked â that California send Â¦ teachers to
Manila, and we have done so. . I received a let
ter from there the other day,' saying. that the
dozen teachers that arrived there: are -highly
satisfactory: Â¦ that they are so. eager -for edu
cation that they want 'to* open t great schools
there, and they expect a . great portion of the
teachers to come from California.
â¢.But Of course' t!ie State of California is. inter
ested supremely in furnishing for Its own sons
and daughters > proper . education,' Â¦ ana for up-*
folding the . publlo school 'system, ; This . insti
tution is simply a portion of the State. The
Btate does not only own it, but controls it, and
it exists for. the State and for no other purpose
than to serve the State, and it Is the State.:
This institution has grown 395 per cent in- ten
years and consequently In the last two years
we have not been able' to go on as we woulu,
on account of' the slse of our classes. : There are'
classes In elementary English of .fifty or elxty;
in elementary French and German of that num
ber; classes In history that go, into large num
bers. We have 325 students in one class in, bot
any. ;It is necessary to separate that class into
two sections, simply because there is not room
enough to allow them to be together. Â¦ Classes
in history, 100 in number, Â¦ and Â¦ no possible way
of separating that class. We' simply go on' the
best we can. but we are not' doing right; Â¦ I
know: we are not doing right by the students
you know we are not doing right. Any one
coming In and, looking at. our classes will see
boys sitting on chairs on each side of the aisles,'
and sometimes â¢ in â¢ chairs at the doors leading
Into the rooms. ., . Â« â¢
Only five yetfrs ago 67 per " cent of , the" stu

It Is not my creation nor my doing, so it
is my right to say it is absolutely so. When
I go anywhere out of thls^tate to do anything
In behalf of the. university, to ask. any -favors
for it, to get any men to come to it, then I
become aware of the great respect in which It
is held. It has a good name, and it has a
crprlit. and credit Is a large part of its capital.
Men never can tinker with Us credit. It ie upon
solid ground. . It Is a representative force in
the interests of science and literature. - :.
There is no institutionâ I do not know of
anything in the State of California that has
created as much good an It. or gained more
praise for the State, of California than the
institution at Berkeley.
Mr. Speaker and Committeemenâ It .affords
me a great opportunity and' a very great
honor to stand upon the floor of this House
of Representatives of the State of California.

an absolutely good cause. AVe have no apol
ogies to make. I am not here to go into tech
nicalities or ' to resort to diplomacy. If, my
cause needs some syrup, ask somebody else,
please, to furnish the syrup. I wish to tell
you simply a straight tale, to tell you the
needs of our. great university as. they are, and
please to excuse me from savoring the dose.
I will tell you so far as I know just what
the institution is, over which I have the honor
to preside, which is granted to be as an un
dergraduate institution the second in the land
â only old Harvard at Cambridge is ahead of
us. If. you could have been with , us last
Friday morning in the gymnasium, the only
room large- enough to cover us, and only cre
ated lately, in order that we might once, in a
while get together, where 2500 students and
professors were. It would be a lesson in words
which no speaker could picture.
President Wheeler spoko as follows:
Trie university bill will be held in abey
ance, it is understood, until President
Wheeler has had a conference with Gov
oronr Gage upon the latter's return from
Los Angeles. ' Until then no committee
action is expected upon the old bills, nor
will any new measures- be drafted and

son having detained him 'in Los Angeles,

Special Dicpatch to The Call.
CALLi HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 22.â "What Is the matter
with Ralston?" Is the unanswered ques
tion that Is going the rounds to-day. Hi*
attitude on the bill to appropriate $150,000
to go with a similar amount to be appro
priated by the Federal Government to
complete the work proposed by. the Gov
ernment engineers Is causing much com
ment from his colleagues in the Legisla
ture and many anxious telegrams from
his constituents and the members of ths
Miners'. Association. .
It is generally believed that Ralston Is
working out the will of Governor Gace,
who, preferring not to sign the bill should
it come before him and fearing to veto It.
is anxious that it be hung up in committee
or in the Legislature. Halston's attitude
is in line with this policy and directly at
variance with the' letter and spirit of the
resolutions passed at the last miners' con
vention and at the recent meeting of tho
executive committee of that body.
At the meeting: of the executive com
mittee, which was held since the Liegia
lature opened, it was resolved that every
honorable means should be used to carry
through the Legislature the miners'
measures now before it.
The most important of all these is the
appropriation bill. In anticipation of the
passage .of such a bill Congressman
Woods, after a hard fight in committed,
had Congress remove the restrictions from
the first $500,000 so as to make it immedi
ately available. When this was done
there was a sentiment among- a good
many which showed a disposition to usn
the $500,000 and by declining to approprlata
the extra $300,000 force the Federal Gov
ernment to. put up the full amount Itself
in order to save the whole, but the en
gineers have grasped the situation and
Colonel W. . H. Keuer has declared be
fore the Committee on Mining,. and open-i
ly, .that not one shovel of earth will be
turned over until the State has her full
half of the $300,000 appropriated.
It has been contended that the im
pounding plan is a. river and harbor im
provement, butithe Government engineers
look at it differently. They say the riv
ers are - changing, clearing themselves,
now; that hydraulic mining has been re
stricted, and that the impounding dams
are , solely for the benefit of the miners.
The rivers do not need . the dams, the
miners do. . There will be a meeting of tho
Committee on Mines again to-morrow,
which Lieutenant Governor Neff . the Nes
tor of theÂ»California miners, will attend. 1
There will also be several of the Senators
from the. mining districts present and aa

of their- prii-ate purses. It Is going to be
given us. We have gone along on bare ground
so long that I as president of the I university
would feel I would not be Justified In doing
anything else but appeal to the State. But
I do not say this to encourage the State to
shirk its responsibility. Â¦
â¢
first institutions of the country, and I could
not say a dollar to him, I had to talk to
him of the university's future possibilities, its
worth and what a grand chance there would
be in California. That argument counted, and
tho man stayed here, . because he believes in
the future of the university. He knows as
well as I know that- no university, was ever |
throttled, no university was ever ruined be- ]
cause of the demand for its rights. There will ;
be Borne way to make that grand Institution
what It should be. I dfr- not know who Is
going- to do It. I am not here to find a way, |
but I know there are means. We have got
our money for the years past, and we haven't
a cent more than thatâ no more than .we had
when there were 14C0 students at . the univer
sity. We are going: along in the 'same way.
I know we shall be taken care of. You Call
fornians don't want to be mean about things
of Oils kind. "We will go ahead and do the
work, and you must look out for us.
We need a -library. The position in which
the professors stand demands that they have
the best library there, more than anywhere.
We have S0.0OO volumes; Harvard has 575,000.
Stanford increased 17,000 volumes last year.
We have almost two students to Stanford's
one. We need a library building, and It will
be prepared, I trust, by private generosity be
fore long. Â¦ I' don't contemplate, anything lesa
than $2,000,000 for it We have this year 6pent
$3600 for now, books; we ought ââ¢ to . have; - ha.l
$13,000 to Bj>end,for that purpose.
We want to flttout an experimental dairy:
and nothing less' than $15,000 or |I0,000 should
be offered forvthis purpose. > >. s Â¦ Â»Â¦*Â¦ i . w
We want to carry On the university ex
tension work.- The university* at Chicago uses
$14,000 annually fdr University "extension. We
ought to have for .that purpose $10,000. We
want to start a department of irrigation. We
want' a department . In forestry. We want to
add to the equipment at the Lick Observa
tory. We ought to do something for forestry-
I believe we could start our forestry work on
a* solid basis for. J10.000. ,
Â¦ Other departments of the university need to
be quickened, strengthened and enlarged. In
the department . of -chemistry In .the last fif
teen yt-ars the number of students, haB grown
eleven fold, the number of teachers threefold.
We need more Instructors in the mechanical
and electrical engineering department. We
need another teacher- of , Spanish and more
teachers in the German department.
We want to start a school of architecture.
â¢Mrs. Hearst is going to start the building of
the new university under the Benard plans
and she expects to start it Just as soon as
the working plans can be prepared.
But let us not mix the two things. Do not
let us ask her to give the money for tho
buildings and to look out for the educational
side also. She wants to co-operate with the
State to make the university architecturally
the greatest in the United States, yes, the
greatest In Anglo-Saxondom.
We expect to enlarge our department of Ju
risprudence. We â¢ want to expand our miner
alogy and geology. departments. You believe
as I do .that every cent expended on the de
partment of mining or agriculture has come
back fivefold to the State. Every one knows
it that knows anything of the services of
these departments. â '
Â¦ If you will study the roll of the students
at Berkeley you will find one out of five the
non or daughter of a farmer; one -of -ten the
son or daughter of a laborer. Seven and one
half per cent tomo from the families of clerks
in the employ of others by the week. Tho de
mand for education we find here in California
greater than anywhere in tho country. Thts
demand shows that the people of California
are not different from what you expect them
to be when you know of the 'pioneers here
before them. They do not want their ' chil
dren to be brought up In mediocrity. .Their
daughters and sons shall have a chance with
everybody, and that â¢ institution stands there
to meet that demand of the peoplei of the
. State of California." I thank you very much.

"Well, two of the Commissioners have

Fisk of San Francisco was decidedly in
favor of an investigation, and offered a
substitute resolution which contained the
additional requirement that demand be
made upon the commission to have all Its
reports and copies of all vouchers filed
with the investigating committee within
twenty days.
Brown of San Mateo was in favor of
investigation but opposed the amendment,
claiming that there had been ample time
for the filing of vouchers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY- 23, 1901.
WHEELER, AND OTHERS AS- SÂ£EN BY A CARTOONIST.
.Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkabU
case of acute troublo and chronio
dyspepsia by the use of the new discov-
ery, Stuart's r>yspepsia. Tablets.
He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for year*
with dyspepsia. Bverythlns he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stamaclt.
He had pains like rheumatism in tho
back, shoulder blades and limbs, fullness
and distress after eating, poor appetite
and loss of flesh; the heart became af-
fected, causing palpitation and sleepless-
ness at nlfrht.
"I. gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As
an experiment. I finally bought a 60-cent
package of Stuart's Etyspepsia. Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most immediate relief was given, and af-
ter he had used four boxes he was to all
appearances fully cured.
"There was . no more acidity or soar,
watery risings, no bloating after meals,
the appetite was vigorous and he had
gained between ten and twelve pounds In
weight of soltd healthy, flesh. *:
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold In drug. stores,
yet I consider ihem a most valuable ad-
dition to any physician's line of remedies
as they are perfectly harmless and can be
given to children or invalids or In any
condition of the stomach, with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
nothing but fruit and vegetable essences,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
'Without any question they aro tha
safest, most effective cure for indigestion
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
severe." #
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are made by
the F. A. Stuart Co. of Marshall. Mich .

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â A comprehen- ;
slve plan for the irrigation of the arid
lands of the West without ultimate cost
to the Federal Government was outlined
to-day to the Committee" on Irrigation of
Arid Lands by Representative Barham-
Representative Barham retires from Con
gress at the close of the present session
and he did not ask action to-day upon
any definite measure of legislation. He
simply gave the committee the benefit of
fcls thought and study upon the princi
ples which- should govern Congress when
the policy of Irrigation Is taken up. He
declared It should be done by the Federal
Government upon a broad scale and ap
propriated for by a system of continuing
contracts, like the river and harbor im
provements. The cost of work could then
be charged from time to time to the own
ers of lands at a rate of perhaps seventy
five* cents an acre for private holders. and
$1 an acre for. the railways. The finances
of the project could be so adjusted as not
to impose sudden and excessive ' burdens
upon landholders, but provide for gradual
compensation to the Government ; for Its
expenditures upon some such plait as that
adopted -by the Â¦ Russian Government ; in
buying lands from nobles for serfs 'when
the latter were liberated In 1S61. - " :'.- Â¦-Â¦

TWO HOUSES TO
COUNT THE VOTES
It was rumored to-day that General
Miles had been Informed that he could
have the nomination j provided he agreed
to Immediatelyvretire, but thi3 report was
emphatically denied by officials in a po
sition to know. It is admitted even by
General Miles' enemies that he stands
the best chance of securing the nomina
tion and General Miles does not appear to
be alarmed over the possibility that he
will not be given it. The creatlon'of the
grade of lieutenant general does not nec
essarily renuire General Miles' appoint
ment. Nwhlle the provision regarding, the
adjutant general makes It mandatory
upon the President to nominate Corbln.
On behalf of Corbin 't is stated that Gen
eral Miles had . ample opportunity to
amend the bill: in fact, he appeared be
fore the committees of the House and
Senate and advocated Its \ passage, snsr
gestlng' no change in the provision relat
ing to lieutenant general.
Adjutant General Coibln, It 1st stated
by close personal friends, does not as
pire to be lieutenant general, but Major
General J. R. Brooke and Major General
E. S. Otis, both of whom retire before
General Miles, have. It is said, presented
their claims for the President's considera
tion.
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 22.â Major Gener
al X. A. Miles, who. as senior- officer of
his grade, holds by law the rank of lieu
tenant general, will proDably be appointed
lieutenant general of the army under the
reorganization act now pending in Con
gress, although he will have brisk oppo
sition.
Both Are Anxious to Be
V Named Lieutenant Gen
eral of the Army.
QIIS AND BROOKE
OPPOSE MILES
The dam across thu'Gila is expected not
only to supply the Indians of San Carlos
reservation, of whom there are about 4000.
but to furnish water for the irrigation
of much valuable land outside the Indian
reservation. It is considered essential to
the support of the Indians.
Tour committee believes that the Indian
schools of the country should be made as ef
ficient as possible, and that where additional
facilities are needed the Department of the
Interior shotlld be enabled to provide them.
and your committee has acted on that idea in
providing fund for that purpose.
There are several amendments affecting
Indian schools and of these the report
says :
The Question cf capitalization of the annui
ties of the Indian tribes Is a matter that has
bÂ«ea considered for some time, not only by
the committee but by the Secretary of the
Interior and the Commission of Indian Af
fairs as well. Believing; that such a departure
should be inaugurated as will definitely fix
the amount due to each tribe under the pro
visions of treaties providing for annuities,
your committee has thought It best to- capital
ize the annuities due the tribes of Indiana
designated in the bill.
"WASHINGTON. Jan. 22.â The Senate
Committee on Indian Affairs to-day made
its report on the Indian bill. The com
mittee recommends the increase of the

The Creeks threaten that after they
have cleaned out all the Interior whltÂ»3
they will visit the .various towns in the
Creek nation. d.estrov them by flre and
kill the inhabitants. They have threat
. ened to kill Chief Porter and any of the
members of the Dawes Commission that
attempt to interfera with. them. Great
fear is felt for some of the commission
who are surveying and allotting lands In
that section of the c^'-Mitry.
Laptah Mekko. *..ne insurrectionary
chief of the Snake bands, has submitted
the following ultimatum to President Mc-
Kinley -
"HICKORTTOWK. Creek Capitalâ To
President McKinley, Washingtonâ Sir: J
have already informed you of the matter
concerning the execution of the Creek
laws. I am now executing my laws as I
told you I would.
"LAPTAH MEKKO. Principal Chief."
The Creek jurisdiction has been trans
ferred to the United States courts' for
several years and the Scake chief's noti
fication to the President that he will exe
cute the old Creek laws is considered as
merely a message of defiance.
The chief of the warring Indians is i
half-breed. He has Just returned from
Washington and claims to carry with hlni
the authority of the President and Con
gress to run thÂ«Â» Daw?s commission and
all white people out of the Territorv.
He uses this argument to gain follow
ers, who apparently place great faith In
him.
General Pleasant Porter, the chief of the
Creeks. Is in Washington, and the Indian
authorities are powerless to afford any
protection. Roley Mclntosh. who wa3
formerly second chief of the tribe, has or
ganized a band of fifty friendly Indians
and whites for mutual protection. There
have . been numerous whippings and one
man was killed near Wetumka: Wor'd
reached Marshal Bennett to-day that two
other men had been killed within the past
few days.
There are four distinct bands of these
Indians who are armed. ! They claim a
membership, including? men. women and
children, of over 5000. Their leader. Crazy
Snake, was In Chocotah yesterday pur
chasing supplies. He said that 500 full
bloods were ready to flg-ht for their old
laws and customs, and were going to op
poseto the end all efforts to deprive them
of their Independence.
The towns most affected by the uprising
are Fentress, Furess, Senora. Watson
ville. Proctor, Burney, Bald Mountain.
Bad Creek and the settlements along the
Deep Fork of the Canadian River, alto
gether embracing an area of twenty-live
miles square. Information received by
Marshal Bennett Is to the effect that while
men, women and children are fleeing from
the towns located in this district, scores
are locked up and barricaded, and the
riotous Indians are confiscating all the
good horses in the settlement. So far
there has been no report of bodily harm
to the whites.
MCSCOGEE. I. T.. Jan. "2.â Advices re
ceived by United States llarshat Bennett
to-day state that 3C0 full-blood Creek In
dians, heavily armed, are scouring the
country forty miles southwest of- here,
terrorizing the whites and trying to make
the members of their own tribe observe
the old tribal laws. Marshal Bennett was
kept well informed as to the movements
of this band of Indians, which is known
as the "snake band/; but did not believe
Federal interference necessary- Informa
tion received by him to-day, however, con
vinced him. thai he could not quell the up
rising, and he immediately telegraphed
the Secretary of War for a troop of cav
alry. A troop from Fort Reno will reach
the scene wtthin tw'enty-four hours after
receiving orders.

The incident is vvo'rth investigating for the sake of
the truth of -history. It will be strange if civilizatioti
has called upon, China to put to death a man whose
deed in any civilized country would have been honored
as'a stanch devotion' to dangerous duty. v \.
If the Sun's story be true it can be readily under-
Stood why, the condemned man bore his sentence of
death with such . fortitude and gayety of heart. Â¦ ii*
he were actin-g under, orders as a". soldier arid did no
more than his duty he had the consolations of military,
discipline as well as those of patriotism and religion
to sustain him. . Moreover, he doubtless knew - that
when the Empress of China gets back to power, again
she will make his name; one of which; any Chinese
might be proud. . Â¦ ':/Â¦Â¦Â¦'
As for the soldier himself all accounts say that he
has become something, of a hero. to the Chinese. - In
describing him one report stated*. "The man who
was so soon to die was cheerful' during the period of
waiting. He laughed heartily several times'. .-He said
his name is an honored one and that he is an honest
man."

rROM the Peking correspondent of the New
York Sun there has recently come a strange
â¢ story concerning the killing of the German Min
ister in the Chinese "capital last summer. It will be
remembered the killing was described as an assassina
tion, committed by h mob, and it was everywhere
looked upon. as an outrage against not Germany only
but all civilizationâ a murderous offense for, which
Germany had* a right to demand redress even to the
extent of putting to death" all concerned in it.
* According to the story of the Sun the killing; was
not committed by a mob, nor was it an assassination.
The writer says: "The murderer was a soldier. At
the outbreak of the Boxer troubles he was stationed
in Hataman street, with orders^ to shoot any for
efgner who tried to pass. The killing of Baron von
Ketteler was done in obedience to these orders. It
is admitted by . foreigners,, including '. Dr. Mumm von
Schwartzenstein, the present German Minister," that
the man would not have been executed in a Euro
pean country."

Pupin believes that f communication . with Europe
will be "as audible and- as certain as it is now; be
tween-points fifty miles apart. â¢
Professor Pupin says it is applicable to land lines
and for the same purpose, to preserve energy, and that
in their operation it will 'effect a great saving. This
economy he estimates at $120,000 a year on each land
circuit between New York and Chicago. If this be
true,. it ' will" be seen that telephone communication
from San Francisqo to New York, '-.without relay, be
comes a certainty. On a direct line there are now
two gaps between the Pacific and Atlantic One of
these is between Reno and Ogdenand the other is
between Denver and Omaha,*; or an aggregate of
about 1300 . mil js. - \
' It is believed that* the- problem has been already
solved. It was a problem of insulation and reinforce
ment of the electric current. The invention is made
by Professor Michael Idvorski Pupin of Yonkers,
N. Y., professor of electrical engineering in Colom
bia College. His invention has' been purchased by
the Bell Telephone Company, which will proceed to
install it. ThÂ« inventor calls his device a "choke
coil," which prevents loss of energy, in the current
by conversion into heat or any other form of leakage.
Electricians now so fully ! command the situation
that they arc sure to make : it possible for the San
Francisco merchant to make his Calcutta order. not
only, verbal but vocal. He will take down Jus phone,
call Calcutta, get it as'easily as he does Oakland,. and
talk with his party on the Ganges as plainly as he
does to" a customer on .the Sacramento.
We put Calcutta as an extreme, for if we command
Europe by telephone we will command Asia also.
IT is probable that the first conspicuous achieve
ment of the twentieth century is to be the exten
sion of the telephone to an equality with the tele
graph as a means of long distance communication.
Since Bell and Gray perfected the telephone, and its
use has been adapted to constantly lengthening land
lines, electricians have looked forward to a telephone
cable to Europe as something sure to be. The
progress 'in telegraphy over long distance cables laid
in deep water has been great since the country read.
"All right, De Sauty," flashed under the Atlantic over
Cyrus W. Field's first cable. Reinforcement of the
current, enfeebled, by leakage, was the first problem
to be solved, and its solution was found in the local
circuit. Since then various facilities have been added
until' the ocean service 4s as certain as that on land,
and a San Francisco merchant can order a cargo in
Calcutta and get notice of .its delivery in less time
than he can order and receive a pair of suspenders
from a store three blocks 'from his desk. â¢
e TELEPHONE TO EUROPE.
A shrewd observer who was recently among us
and had reason to know of what he spoke told us
that we are'losing a vast trade with' Manila because
of our great lack of ships. In conjunction with this
fact we ought to take what consolation we may out
of the announcement that at Washington every obsta
cle for delay is being placed in the way of the subsidy
bill. â¢' " .
The official figures put the crop at 1500 feet pir
acre, average. Granting that the average is twice or
thrice that, an annual consumption for timber and fuel
of 208,488,997.000 feet justifies Mr. Brown's statement
that the result of another decade of active lumbering,
use for fuel and destruction by forest fires will startls
this nation. As forest fires every year destroy more
timber than is demanded for commerce- and economic
ure, the first thing to do is to put out the fires, find
who causes them and administer punishment Colo
rado complains of a loss of $10,000,000 by forest fires
last year. California lost twice as much. Our forest
candle is going fast enough without burning it at. both
ends.
He puts the annual consumption of sawed timber at
28,488,997,000 feet board measure, while the wood
consumed annually for fuel reduced to board measuj*?
is 180,000,000,000.
Mr. Brown presents reports from State foresters
?r.d officers in nearly every State in the Union to
prove his position that the United -States instead of
having 1,094,496 square miles of forest has only 570,
320 square miles. Of this he gives to New England
18,150 square miles, all required for home use; East
ern Atlantic group, 35.900 square miles, none for
export; Southern States, 130,000 square miles, for
export trade to Eastern cities; the prairie States
48.900 square miles, insufficient for local demand for
lumber; Pacific States, west of longitude 103, 212,
400 square miles, for export; the lake States, 44,970
square miles; and the central manufacturing States
80,000 square miles of forest of. very â¢ indifferent
quality.
According to Brown there are in the United States,
including all our continental territory, 2.968,700 square
miles. The plains, prairies and treeless lands cover
1.730.000 square miles, or 60 per cent of the whole,
leaving 40 per cent for forest. But the Geological
Survey reports that 37 per cent of our whole area is
still covered with forest. Mr. Brown shows that this
estimate is grossly erroneous, and has tended to, in
dispose Congress to take measures for forest preser

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
IN BRUSH WILL CASE
Of the succession of the new King to the throne
without disturbance there is therefore no doubt, but
Salisbury is not so safe. The coming campaign will
in all probability be one of the most exciting of re
cent times, and the Liberals, though without a leader
cr a platform, will undoubtedly contest almost every
scat and do their uttermost to win the right to in
augurate the administration of King Edward VII.
The British are more than satisfied with their
form of government; they are proud of it. More
over, the more intelligent among them know that the
crown is the only tie which holds the great colonies
to the empire. Australia and Canada are willing to
admit the constitutional sovereignty of a monarch
who is as much their representative as that of Eng
land, but they would not feel loyalty to a partisan
President chosen by British votes, and in whose elec
tion they had no share.
The struggle for peerages' will constitute an im
portant factor in the fight. It was noted that at the
recent election several of the wealthiest and most in
fluential members of the Commons did not offer
themselves for re-election, and it was generally b:
lieved their reason for withdrawing from politics was
that they had expectations of obtaining peerage?
with the beginning of the new year. The distribu
tion of honors at New Year, however, was far from
liberal. Not a single new peer was created and com
paratively few knighthoods were bestowed. It was
believed at the, time that the limitation put upon the
New Year's honors was due to Salisbury's opposition
to any increase in the number of peers; but the death
of the Queen makes it probable that the Prime Minis
ter was aware she could not live long, and so with
held the desired honors for the purpose of bestowing
them at the coming coronation. It would at any rate
have been good politics for him to have done so,
since in facing the constituencies for. a, new election
it is just as well for him that he still holds in his
hands rewards that so many influential men wish to
obtain.
It has been suggested -in some quarters that tht
beginning of the new reign will be marked by a re
vival of an agitation for the overthrow of the crown
and the establishment of a republic in Great Britain.
It is indeed quite likely such will be the case. Every
Presidential election in this country brings to the
front all kinds of reformers and reform candidates,
and a change in the person of the "sovereign in Britain
will doubtless ;have a similar effect. The republican
agitation there, : however, is not likely to be of much
more importance than the nomination of a candidate
on a socialist platform in the United States.
As a matter of fact the poHtical campaign has al
ready begun. Reports from London show that an
effort i$ being made to discredit the Salisbury Min
istry by spreading abroad the impression that the.wr.r.
in South Africa was begun in spite of the QueenV
wish, and that by reason of its effect upon her mind
it -hastened her death. Such tactics can hardly be
called legitimate politics, but they will have some in
fluence in determining the- votes of sentimental peo
ple, and perhaps the Conservatives may really be
weakened in the-coming contest because of them.
UNDER the British system of government" Par
liament closes with the life of the sovereign
who summone-1 it. Consequently, despite the
.fact that this Parliament was. chosen only a fevy
mdnths ago; it will now be dissolved and a new Par
liament called in the name. of. the new King. More
over, it has ever been the custom for British sover
eigns on acceding to the throne to mark the event,
by the bestowal of honors, including peerages, and
it is known the custom is not going to be violated
on this occasion. By reason of these things the pe
riod of mourning for Victoria is going to be dis
turbed by preparations for the coming political cam
paign and by intrigues for a share in the honors that
are to follow the coronation.

Stanford should have its bills and Berkeley should
have its money, and the high competition of the two
should be favored, to the end that each may do its
best for learning and letters, to the honor of Cali
fornia.
Their effect is to be for all time, for the unlimited
future, for the enfranchisement and equipment of that
university to help itself. It should not be made the
present victim of a narrow partisanship of a group of
professors who have let their temper destroy their
judgment. . - .
The Legislature should rise above any sentiment
generated in the passing confusion at Palo Alto, ami
pass the Stanford bills.
It is a truth that is beyond question that the re3l
usefulness of the State University began with the rise
of Stanford. If either decline now the other will suf
fer. It is a matter of great pride that only California
â¢ ;as within its borders two such institutions. No other
State in this Union has room, for two of equal capac
ity and usefulness. In possessing them California has
more than can be the boast of any nation in Europe.
The Stanford affair is a passing incident. Within
a year it will have receded so far as to be forgotten.
Therefore it makes no part of a reason why this Leg
islature should not proceed to vitalize the amend
ments to the constitution which the people so gen
erously indorsed.
The rumor runs that these bills will not pass be
cause of the Ross incident and- its sequences. We
hope this is not true. The troubles at Stanford have
their precedent and analogue in the political difficul
ties at Berkeley, in which several of the professors,
including one of the Le Contes, -had to resign. But
Berkeley outlived all that. Harvard has had a mem
ber of one of her faculties hanged for murder and
another rests now under' the same charge, but Har
vard wag not injured.
We repeat that California cannot afford to list her
university among the indigent and infirm, and the
Legislature has no higher duty than its proper and
prompt relief. I \
The case of Stanford University is widely differ
ent. The Stanford bills are merely to help that uni
versity to help itself.
The University Regents are appointed and serve
for long terms, and when they handle money appro
priated out of the general fund the oversight of some
agency that represents the taxpayers is not undesir
able. It is to be hoped that the appropriation, if made,
will become available" in time to relieve the pinch in
university finances, and that if some other method
be more desirable the alumni, faculty and Regents
will mak& use of the next two years in familiarizing
the people therewith, so that the next Legislature
will be prepared to adopt it.
Against this objection, however, it may be urged
that all expenditures of public money should be sub
ject to the oversight of some agency derived from
the people and representing them.
IT happens that the Legislature is. concerned with
the interests of both of our great universities.
It appears to be -certain that 'the measure for
relief of the State University drawn, by the Palace
Hotel conference* will not pass, because it does not
meet the views of the Governor. He does not oppose
adequate aid to the institution, but believes it should
be extended- in the same manner as to other State
institutions, by a regular biennial appropriation. ' The
university authorities are not as anxious about the
method employed as they are for the relief itself, so
that we assume they will find no difficulty in accom
modating their views to the Governor's position. The
system of direct appropriation brings the expendi
ture under control of the State Board of. Exam
iners, which may cause" some friction and inconve
nience in the administration of the fund.

PERSONAL MENTION.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
EDITOR CALL.: In a recent issue of your paper an extract from an
Eastern editorial was published under the title of "Scientists in Court," in
which this statement occurs: "Before one of the New York courts there Is
a contested will case pending, and every day the courtroom is thronged
with Christian Scientists whose avowed object is to influence the Judge in
rendering an opinion to their liking by the silent exercise on his mind of the
psychical powers which the Scientists believe they possess."
Any one at all familiar with Christian Science would know that the above
statement was not true. Mr." Willard S. Mattox, a prominent Christian
Scientist of New York City, replying to a similar editorial in the Buffalo
Express, said: "This false charge, that Christian Scientists are exerting
mental influence to. affect the decision of Judge Fitzgerald In the Brush will
case, is an accusation common to the hypnotists and mental malpractition
ers in their arguments against Christian Scientists. Christian Scientists
never enter another's thought uninvited, and then never except to destroy
sin or sickness. The conflict to-day is between two mental forces, the Christ
mind and the carnal mind, or hypnotism. In this instance, hypnotists are
charging .Christian Science with their own methods." '
The following from the ChristMfc Science textbook, "Science and Health
with Key to-' the Scriptures," by, Mary. Baker G. Eddy, shows that any use
of hypotlsm is contrary to the teachings of Christian Science: "We have no
authority in Christian Science, and no moral right, to attempt to influence
the thoughts of another, except it be to benefit him or we are personally re
quested to give him aid. â¢ â¢ â¢ Any hypnotic power you may exercise will
diminish your ability to become a Scientist, and vice versa. The act of heal
ings the sick through Mind alone, ot casting out error with Truth, shows your
position as a Christian." The power of Christian Science is not hypnotic,
_but is the power of God. FRANK W. GALE.

Mt"D. from the time of Its incep
tion until it becomes sticky,
fast and holding and past
classification, was always a
potent factor fn racing, and r,j
Its treacherous and deceptive allurings
has been ascribed the defeat of many a
warmly played choice. Well, it was the
Fame old story at Tanforan Park yester
day. Six well, meant and favorably dis
posed favorites were sent to the post, and
but one was returned a winner. In stat
ing this, one would be apt to think the
bookmakers retired with all the money,
but such was not the case, for the differ
ent winners â Marshal Xeil, Rey del Ban-
ClCos, Great Bend, Sublime and Hercu
leanâwere all well supported.
For a curtain-raiser. Tommy Burns, on
the 11 to 10 favorite Grafter, managed to
lore cut to Marshal Neil, the second
choice. Tommy never experienced much
luck piloting favorites, and after beat-
Ing thÂ© gate- with Grafter, permitted Buil
man. on the Marshal, to get up and win
b> over a length. Pat Dunne's filly Bon
nie Llssak made her first appearance, and,
well backed, finished third.
In all of his past races Dr. ScharCf had
shown tremendous speed, and It looked
perfectly plausible that the youngster
should be installed favorite for the two
year-old dash. Milt Henry got him away
ln the lead and won galloping from J. V
KIrby. At a longer distance the latter
might have won, but as it was he did his
best Dominlck, astride Mike Murphy,
ran third.
Rey del Bandidos, a 10 to 1 outsider, took
the mile and a sixteenth selling affair.
Stuart, who rode the big chestnut the day
before, again 6at in the saddle, beating
Mary Kinsella to the wire by two lengths.
Kaunette, from the stable of W. J. Spiers,
had first call in the pit, and If the mare
ever had any ppeed it was left in the
stable. Ulm. another heavily played one,
also failed to answer rolleall.
Milt Henry had the pleasure of piloting
about the best-backed choice of the
afternoon ln TuthllU which went to the
I>ost 8 to 5 for the six furlong jaunt,
fourth on the menu. He was outfooted
at that, znessed about on the rail, and
the money was burnt up early In the
game. Domlnick saved half a block at
the Ftretch turn with Great Bend, leading
Rollick past the judges by three lengths.
Next came a Job lot bunch of maidens
ln a fix furlong scramble. Companion
beat the gate several lengths and was
then collared and beaten out by Sublime,
a 6 to 1 shot ridden by Fauntleroy. Skip
M<Â». the favorite, ran unplaced.
Once more, in the closing mile selling
run, Tommy Burn? had the mount on a
warm favorite. Formero was pent to the
post an even money choice, but the best
Tommy could do was to finish second to
Herculean, superbly ridden by Milt
Henry. The winner's odds were pounded
d^wn" from threes to 13 to 5. Lou Rey ran
a close third.

When asked for his opinion of the Sloan
case the young English Jockey professed
Ignorance of the facts, excepting what
he had read in the newspapers. He, how
ever, wns frank enough to speak a kind
word for the American Jockey, and the
American horseman in general.
Speaking of the American riding forms
Loates said he thought they would event
ually be adopted on the English turf.
The position of the American Jockey on
the horse is everything to his "advantage,
he thought, and short stirrups formed
another improvement which the English
riders are bound to observe. Indeed,
some of them have already adopted the
short stirrup,. Including himself.
Loates is a great lover of all kinds of
sport and he may do some hunting be
fore leaving the coast.
rode for Sir Blundell Maple, and. he ha:
been re-engaged by Maple for the comini
season. Two years ago Loates met To<
Sloan in a match and beat him.
SAM LOATES, the Tod Sloan of
England, Is in town. He arrived
with his wife yesterday afternoon
and put up at the Palace. Ix>ates'
trip to this coast is purely one of
pleasure and unless he is persuad
ed to change his mind he will not do any
riding while in San Francisco. He has
been visiting friends in New York and Chi
cago, and after a stay of a week or ten
days here, he will make a short trip to
Los Angeles, returning to England in time
to ride at the Lincoln races, which begin
the latter part of March.
Loates stands at the head of the winning
list of English jockeys, and' held first
place with the riders of the world up, to
within two months prior to the closing
of the season last year,, when Reiff, the
American Jockey, earned first place. Dur
ing the entire season of 1829*1900 Loates

CARSOX, Nev., Jan. 22.â The first blow
In the lottery fight was struck to-day in
the Assembly. The lottery men Intended
to let thts matter rest until they were
properly organized, but the anti-lottery
forces took it up In an unexpected quar
ter. Assemblyman Wilson of lilko County
introduced the following resolution:
Whereas. A public rumor which has reached
the national legislative hails exists to the
eftect that the twentieth session of the Legis
lature of the State < f Nevada Intends passing
Â«n amendment to the constitution of the State
establishing a lottery In the State, whereby
the 8tate shall participate in the spoils plun
dered from the people; whereas, such rumor
is unjust to our F*opl*. injurious to the State
and &. direct reflection upon our honor and
upen the fidelity of ourselves to the pledges
taken by ut as set forth in the platforms of
all political parties in the State; whereas,
such rumor Is calculated Kreatiy to injure, the
chances of pending legislation in Congress of
special interest to the State, and is further
calculated to invite national action deprlvins
Nevada cf statehood by furnishing: a reason
therefore; whereas, the present session of Con
grees will soon be adjourned and it la neces
sary that the attitude of this Legislature on
the proposed constitutional amendment should
be brought speedily before Congress, and
whereas, we as members of the Assembly are
Hrmly opposed to the passage of any amend
ment to the constitution of this State, there
fore be it
Resolved. That a Joint committee of the
Legislature of the State of Nevada, to consist
of two members of the Senate and three from
the Assembly, be appointed to draft a
suitable memorial to Congress embodying the
views of the present session of thi* Legisla
ture upon the proposed lottery amendment.
Mr. Platt. representative of Ormsby,
moved that the resolution be laid on the
table. After an extended debate, the roll
call was demanded, which resulted in the
resolution being adopted by a vote of 35
to 3. The friends of the lottery claim that
the xiaFsage of the resolution doe? not in
any way defeat the plan. They contend
that it was merely a plan to force their
hand, but by voting "yes" with the
schemers it leaves the matter still in
doubt.
The question now before both parties is.
what action the Senate will take in the
matter. Should the resolution be turned
dewn In the session, the anti-lottery
foiccs will have lost the trick they played
for. As the resolution has been offered
without "history" or committee indoVse
nunt. it i? likely to be ignored In the Sen
ate. Neither house *has appointed com
mittees yet, and, as one lottery man
stated to-day, the resolution went off be
fore it was ready, thus losing its force.
The fact that friends of the lottery
arr.endment voted for Wilson's resolution
makes It of no value for or against the
lottery.
Friends . of the Proposed Measure,
However, Are Still Confident
and Claim the Matter Is
Not Yet Settled.

Judge Dale, In the District Court this

terday afternoon wrecked two saloons with
rocks and canes. Their bond. was placed
at $1000 each, and was Immediately given.
The women went at once to the ; W.' C. TV

was held, and it was officially decided,
upon to wreck more saloons in Wichita
at the first opportunity.
Twenty men have signed a pledge to
follow the example of Mrs. Nation/ Kvery

Because last night Mrs. Nation slapped
the Sheriff's ears when she was arrested
with her. two companions she was placed
on bread and: water to-day:
â¢Early this morning fifty men surrounded
the Jail and talked loudly about lynching.
This, it is supposed, was to frighten Mrs.
Nation and her assistants-. The mob was
ordered away by the Sheriff.'- This morn

tion of property â¢ were placed j against 5 the
three women, -but .were not sworn to by
any of the saloon men, 1 but by owners 'of
buildings which were damaged.
Mrs. Â¦ Nation's attorney^ declares they
cannot be prosecuted for wrecking even
the buildings, because there is a Taw In
Kansas which denies the owners of build

Detective Coleman and Officer McMur
ray of the Society for the Prevention 'of
Cruelty to Children were detailed on the
case, and they ascertained that Smith, the
boys, stepfather, worked as solicitor until
last Thursday for H. C. Decker, real es
tate agent. 1020 Market street. Smith was
In Decker's office Saturday In connection
with the sale of a cigar-stand at 155
Fifth street. At 783% Market street they
learned that Smith, before leaving there,
said he was to apply for a divorce from
his wife. She did not live there, so it is
supposed they have been living 1 apart for
some time. â
A man supposed to be a -native of Swe
den had been calling at the lodging-house
looking after Smith's letters, and said
that Smith was living /at 1118 Market
street. Inquiry at that number, however,
disclosed the fact that neither Smith nor
the man from Sweden was known there.
The officers. are keeping up the search
and expect to finally locate the missing
stepfather. ,*<_/.

PEKING, Ja)i. 22.â To-day the foreign'
envoys discussed the report of the Chin
ese plenipotentiaries, especially in the
matter of punishments, and exempted Tsl
Lien and Tsl-Wing as- being. less guilty
than the others.
The reply to the Chinese note will be de
livered Thursday. It will emphasize the
point that the signing of the -. agreement
will bo without value unless good faith is
shown by acts and -that it will be abso
lutely useless to expect the removal of the
troops or concessions upon the part of the
allies until China conclusively proves hor
good intentions. Russia has almost com
pleted the turning over of the railroads
to' the Germans. .
Count- von -Waldersee expects to leave
early In April. The Germans say they
will keep the railroad temporarily . as a
military necessity. The British object to
this course and the- matter will be ro

AMONG the passengers, by the
overland train yesterday morn
ing: were three small boys from
St. Joseph, Mo., each of whom
had a tag on his breast suspended
by a string around his neck. Written on
the tags were the lads' names and the
information that they were "going to C.

Arnee, aged 9 years, 5 years and 3 years
respectively. When they reached this
eide of the bay Sergeant Mahoney took
them In charge and handed them over to
Policeman O'Callaghan, with the Instruc
tion to deliver the youngsters according
to directions. O'Callaghan went to the
address named on the tags and was in
formed that Smith had left there a few
days previous and was supposed to be liv
ing at 118 Sixth street. .The officer went
there, but was told that no one of the
name of Smith" lived in the house." The
boys were taken to the City Prison and
placed in care of the matron.
They are bright, intelligent boys, and
do not seem at all awed by their present
surroundings. Harry said that his fath

Â¦;Â¦* RICHMOND, Va.. Jan. 22.â In a letter
to Luther L. Cheatwood of this city
Clarence Worner, formerly of PJchmond,
now quartermaster sergeant of Company
A, Twenty-seventh United States Volun
teers, in the Philippines, gives 'a graphic
account of the municr of one of the
United States officers. He says:
"The Ladrones are still keeping up their
trade-in various portions of the island and
only a few weeks ago City Engineer Wil
son of Manila, who was also superintend
ent of water works, was murdered by tha
Ladrones in the middle of the day and
rdbbed of about $1800 in gold. He was on
his way to oui* station to pay off the em
ployes at- the pumplrig station and had
refused a military escort.
"All the Ladrones concerned in the mur
der, eight in number, have since been
caught by Companies 13 and P. They were
tried by a military: commission and con
fessed. They will be hanged in a few
weeks.
"One of the accused caused the death
of Second Lieutenant Brewer of the
Twenty-seVenth Infantry, U. S. V., while
the latter was on his way to Manila with
one private as escort. The latter was
shot down and LieuiÂ«jnant Brewer,
against whom a Filipino had a special
grudge, was carried ott hv him and somo
companions into the mountains to a de
serted pit.
"LJemenant Brewer's hands and feet
were tied to his body and the unforunate
man was buried alive in an upright posi
tion, with only his head protruding out o*
the ground. After setting a dish of food
before him. Just near enough for him to
look at it, 'the barbarous natives left him
to die in the wilderness. Â¦
"All these facts have just come to light
and the execution of the Ladrones Â¦who
murdtred Wilson has been postponed so
that the accomplices in the Brewer 'oui*
rage may be brought lo light."
MANILA CTLAIMS DISALLOWED.
Merchants of Iloilo Not to Bs Reim

MANILA, Jan. 22.â The disallowance by
the military board of the claims of Hol
man &.Co., merchants of Iloilo, for dam
age to and destruction of property during
the period of appeasement, which findings
have been approved by General MacAr
thur, establishes a precedent against
recompensing for similar property losses
in ttie territory in which the war opera
tions were conducted. -Some claims, nota
bly that of the Manila and Dagupan Rail
road, which are now before the board,
will probablj- go to the Court of Claims
at Washington, and possibly eventually
to Congress.
The oath of allegiance has been admin
istered in a church at Vigan to over 1000

Â¦ In his farewell address to the troopers

"When everything else has failed.
Paine's celery compound has brought me
back to health."
The thousands of Instances where this
has been saidâ the scores of people In
every community who have told this sim-
ple story; the downright, hard, cold facts;
the grateful acknowledgements of men
and women who. have suffered from the
diseases that have their origin In impaired
nervous systems and sluggish. Impure
bloodâ these are what have made Paine's
celery compound far and away the one
remedy above all others that physicians
prescribe and the public Indorse.
; It Is hy l merit, and merit alone, that
Paine's celery compound has achievexi its
wonderful pre-eminence, not only In this
country, but. throughout the civilized
world. ~\ --â¢ Â¦ '. . ' .'. - '
After the unfortunate person who Is all-
Ing because the blood needs new life and
the nerves require nature's food finally
tries Paine's cplerr. compound and gets
Immediate relief, another W added to the
great multitude of people whose praise of
this remedy has made the demand for ..it
many- times larger than that of all other
remedies put together.
A person must have lost all confidence
in his fellowmen who can read the follow-
ing letter â¢ and - not- be convinced of the
great benefit Paine's celery compound has
done, is doing and will continue to do for
sick and nervous people wherever It finds
them.
When a sick man or woman finds that
he or she has taken a remedy that has
actually done for him or her all that Is
claimed for itâ It can be safely predicted
what will follow. Every acquaintance,'
sick or well, will be told about It.
General Rodriguez has written down his
experience in the hope of helping others
who may be so afflicted. The general Is
to-day connected with the civil govern-
ment of Havana. During the struggle for
Cuban independence he rose from the
ranks to the grade of brigadier general,
and in 1S96 won a decisive victory over
General Campos.
General Rodriguez was a very sick man.
He was as near nervous prostration as
one can be and live. five years' suf-
fering his first good night's sleep came
Immediately upon his taking Paine's cel-
ery compound. Hl3 letter reads:
"Dear Sirs: For five years I had not
had a good night's rest. I had a serious
case of nervous prostration, my strength
seemed to be leaving me and I felt tired

back, constipation and an Inactive liver.
I had no appetite and no ambition. I was
constantly consulting- physicians, | and It

die. Providence ?cnt me a bottle of Paine's
celery compound. and|thls erreat remedy
cured me of all the irritable symptoms
with which I was sfflicted. I can frankly
and sincerely *;ay that had It not been for
Paine's celery compound I would to-day

CONFIDENCE GAME OF
EX-CONVICT EDWABDS
Obtains Money From Leading- Hotels
on "Faks" Dispatches Ad
dressed to Himself.
Lv W. Edwards, an ex-convict, has been
working a confidence game that has land
ed him in the City Prison, and to-day he
will be booked on three charges of ob
taining money by false pretenses.
His "gTaft" was to register at a leading
hotel as an army or naval officer. After
registering he would leave the hotel and
send a messenger boy with a "fake" dLs
patch addressed to himself, on which
there was S3 50 to collect. The pueM, be
ing, as It was puppo.Â«*^d, an army officer,
was not suspected and the money would '
be handed to the messenger boy, who
would then give It to Edwards, to whose
account the sum would be charged. At
the Occidental he registered as "Lieuten
ant C. V. SnÂ»th<?"* and at the Russ House
as "Lieutenant C S. Neville."
The police were notified and Detectives
Wren and Dinan were detailed on the
case. Instructions -were left at the hotel?
to notify headquarters at once if Edward.^
should make hie appearance. Yesterday
afternoon the clerk at the California Ho
tel telephoned that a messenger boy had
called -with a dispatch for General Barnes,
with $2 50 to collect.
The boj- was detained and Detective
Hamill was sent to the hotel. He ar
ranged with the boy. Harry Soto. to signal
to him -wrhen Edwards made his appear
ance. The boy did so, and Edwards bolt
ed, but Hamill soon overtook him. Ed
wards was pent to San Quentln from Sls
kiyou County for two years for forgery
and was released but a. few weeks ago.

Marine Insurance Increased.
The underwriters will take no chances
with the Alaska fleet this spring. Last
year there were many wrecks, particular
ly around Nome, and the losses were
heavy. This year they propose to e\-en
up a little if possible. Ata meeting of
the Marine Lnderwriters' Associations
held vesterday it was decided that on all
vessels taking the "outside" passage to
Alaska the rate should be 9 per cent,
while. all vessels talcing the. "inside" pas
sage, going north ef Cornox, B. C. must
pay 15 per cent. Even at these figures
the "risk" will be only taken for six
months, so it looks very much as though
the underwriters were going Into the
gambling business themselves and were
now "posting the odds."
The Charmer's cargo and freight money
are alone Insured and she Is classed as
overdue, yet all the underwriters will pay
to reinsure her is 15 per cent, while an
equally staunch ship bound from here to
Nome or St. Michaels will be charged the
same rate before leaving port.
Steamer Hyades Libeled.
Salusto Beeche and others filed a libel

SHIPOWNERS are not to be caught
napping next season. La?t year
there were not enough vessels to
supply the demand, and this year
It looks as though some new
schooners will have to go hunting for
charters. From one end of the coast to
the other men are working night and day
to get vessels off the ways, and still the
shipbuilders cannot keep up with the
work. At the present time the Hay &
"Wright. Bendixsen and Hall yards have
work enough ahead of them to keep all
hands going for a year. ',,
At the HaH yard in Port Blakeley three
vessels are ready for launching. -while
there are four more whose keels are ready
to be laid. â¢ â¢' . 'i_
The first one that will slide down the
ways will be the barkentine James Tuft.
She is for the Mexican trade and is SOS

The second will be a four-masted schoon
er with a capacity of 1J300.000 feet of lum
ber or 1600 tons dead weight. The third
Is also a four-masted schooner, but her
capacity i3 only 850,000 feet of lumber. Her
managing owner will be George B. Dill
ings, while a sister schooner to her will
be owned by Pope & Talbot.
Besides these the Hall yards are under
contract to build one of the first five
masted schooners in the coast's history
and two four-masted schooners, one with
a capacity of 1,200.000 feet of lumber and
the other with a capacity of S00.O0O feet.
Among the others who are building ves
sels is John S. Kiraball, former president
of the John S. Kltnball Steamship Com

now being built by ReÂ«d of Coos Bay. and
he Is once more going Into the coasting

His Life Through Carelessness.

Manila via Nagasaki last Monday, and
yesterday the men -were paid off. Some
of them took care of their hard-earned
pay and some did not. Last night flve of

Harrison-street wharf they lost command
of the boat anl the tide began to carry
them down. Henry Peterson saw their
predicament and sent one of his launches
to their assistance. Unfortunately -while
jumping from the ship's boat to the launch
a man named Jansen lost his balance and
fell overboard. The undertow took him

"The Panama Company has Instructed

br F. F. Cpnnor. the local representative

acknowledgment that his company Intends
to meet the Pacific Mail rates.
This means that the irate war between

The Panama people are not at all
aiarmed over the Mall's cut rate. The

important item of time, and if the Panama
company finds it necessary to equalize Its
rates with those of the .Pacific Mall, it Is
said that !t can do so to much better ad
vantage than the Pacinc Mail
Manager Schwerin of the Pacific Mail
says that the company's Central Ameri
can agents were instructed some time ago
to rrake such rates as they deemed neces
sary to obtain th* .desired trade. Mr
Schwerin was not disposed to say whether
any limit had been placed upon the rate
cutting, or whether a still greater reduc
tion would be inaugurated should the
Panama start to cut.
"The people of San Francisco have been
howling for competition." said Mr. Schwe

There is a clash between the Western
railroads and the citrus fruit â¢ shippers
which may have a serious termination.
For several winters pas: the Southern Pa
cific and the Â£anta Fe line* have been
<a'.ted severely to task for fiitlir.fr to supply
tbe citrus fruit dealers with the desired ac
commodations:. ProStlr.e by past experi
ence both roads purchased an extra sup-
Ply cf refrigerator cars for the season of
lAi, and with the opening: of the season
the two companies had at their disposal
7V*} cars â a putneient nuraber in the opin
ion of the freight rcanapers to handle all
the fruit that could be picked in Califor
nia this season. Yet every Say complaints
sre tÂ»Mr:Â«r made by shippers, who claim
they cannot pet traffic accommodations.
Some inquiry bm been made by the
Sotithrrn Paciftc officials to determine the
cause of the blockade, and the company
2s convinced th;it the trouble lies with the
shippers and ccr.5!jrr,ees, who have been
doing all the complaining.
It s^*ras that instead of promptly un
icadiTyr the cars alter they have, reached
thfir destination the shippers have al
lowed the fruit to remain in the cars for
Â¦pecuietive purposes. The cars are held
*\ central points, thereby saving the fx
rÂ«rK=e of *tora?e and rehandlinjr. Not sat
'ffied with consuming car after car and
CBonopottZicg valuable track room, the
fhippers and consignors, it is claimed,
have pone so far as to erect stoves in the
cars for the purpose cf sweating- the fruit
to pive it color.

at Jersey City 107 car? filled with Califor
nia orar.gr-s had twen standing untouched
on a sidetrack for more than a week. On
a Chicago line ninety carÂ« were reported
waiting: under similar conditions.
"'I'ndfr such circumstances." said a rail

A very difficult class of cases to de
cide are those in which an employe 13 in
jured by* a foreman. As an employer Is
liable for his own negligence, 2ie. Is also
liable for the negligence cf any one repre
senting him. When an employe' is there
fore Injured by a foreman the employer's
liability turns on the Question. Did th?
foreman represent him or was his main
function or duty like that of the other
employes? In a case that arose in Maine
the court declared that the great weight
of -authority was to, the effect that all
who serve the same master work under
the same control, derive authority and
are paid from the same common source,
and are engaged in the same general busi
ness, though It may be in different grades
or departments of It. are fellow-servants
who take the risk of each other's negli
gence. "The fact that the negligent ser
vant, in his grade of employment. Is su
perior to the servant injured does not. In
the opinion of most of the courts, take the
casa out of the rule; they are equally fel
low-servants and 'the master .is not lia
ble." Within the meaning of this rule a
mere foreman of work is generally re
garded as a fellow-servant with those un
der his control. But if the master has
delegated to the foreman or superintend
ent the care and management of the en
tire business or a Jistinct department,
then the rule" may be different.
In the, case to which this rule was ap
plied a crew of men were engaged und?r
a' foreman" In repairing a dam for a com
pany, and one of the men wa3 injured by
the carelessness of another who acted un
der the direction and immediate observa
tion of the foreman m uoing the act which
caused the Injury. The court remarked
that the repairing of the dam was a com
mon Job* of work and that many men were
employed without essential distinction of
the crew. The foreman did not appear to
be a general manager, but merely a fore
man In a special job of wQtk.. One of th^
ordinary risks of thy employment was
that some man among them rnlerht make
a miscalculation or mistake. The act com
plained of was committed under the fore
man's eye, but und^r the Injured man\j
eye as much, as far as appears. So the
foreman was regarded as a fellow-em-
Eloye like the rest and the company was
eld to be not responsible.
Does a Foreman Bepresmt His Em-
ployerP
One cannot help thinking a second time
bf the remark of the court that some
man among. them might make a miscalcu
lation or mlstakÂ» resulting In Injury to
others. This Is very tiuc. but Is there not
a difference between a foreman and other
men? Suppose three men are at work
moving, 'for example, % heavy stove. Each
suggests a- different way of moving it;
the suggestion of one ol them is adopted
and in moving it one or all are injured. In
this case plainly the risk Is their own and
they cannot look to their employer. Sup
pose he appoints one of the three as a
foreman to move the stove and he gives
an order concerning its removal which re
sulffi In Injury to one or all of themâ
ought not. his act to be regarded a3 the
act of his employer and render him lia
ble?
Car Conductors.
Suppose a fellow-?ervant is clothed with
some special authority, as a railroad con
ductor, for example, does he thereby be
come the agent or representative of the
company, rendering It ltable for his acts
when It would not be otherwise? Thus In
the case of Wooden against a railroad In
Xew York the'eompany had a printed rule
requiring conductors of freight trains to
apply for Instructions, or' to cut off cars
If they had any doubt of making a safe
pas5age over a summit k with dangerous
grades. It. was claimed that by giving
him this authority or direction he was
changed Into a representative of the com
pany. The reason for making this claim
was that in conducting his train a train
man was injured and he knew that he
could not hold the company liable If the
conductor and himself were fellow-em
ployes; If they were not then the company
would be liable on the ground that the
conductor was its agent, its representa
tive. The court said that "a conductor of
a railroad train is frequently called upon,
in the proper exercise of its functions, to
use his judgment; but it would be absurd
to say. when exercising that judgment,
that he was necessarily transformed from
the mere servant- to the agent or repre
sentative of the master."
A superintendent or assistant superin
tendent is clearly an agent or representa
tive of his employer, and in most cases, as
we have seen, a railroad dispatcher of
trains Is also included. Nevertheless their
relationship was doubted in one Illinois
case by the counsel for a railroad com
pany. But the court said, as between the
conductor and the company, the assistant,
to whose orders the trains are all subject,
is the representative of the corporation.
His orders to the conductor of a train are
essentially the orders "of the employer.
This rule applies as well to all orders Is
sued by his assistants in his office and is
sued in his name. If those Intrusted by
him with the management of the business
of the corporation by orders issued In his
name neglect to Issue a necessary order,
that is his neglect and the negligence of
tne corporation.
The Rule in West Virginia.
In one of the more recent cases the Su
preme Court of West Virginia, -after re
viewing many decisions, remarked that
the rule to be drawn from them seemed to
be that, two servants of the same master
were not fellow servants when one acts
In a superior capacity to the other In re
gard to some Â«luty due from the master.
In such a case the master was liable for
any Injuries to the subordinate caused by
the negligence or carelessness of the supe
rior. "At one time,". the court added "to
make the master responsible he must have
instructed this superior servant with the
actual control of all his business." After
ward this view was modified, and it was
held that the superior servant represented
his master, filled his place. If he had pow
er to employ and discharge the servants
under him. "But now it sevns to be con
sidered sufficient that the Inferior se/vant
is under the control and . subject to the
orders of the superior . servant." Finally
the court sums up the present rule thuÂ«:
That only where servants are so; far
working together as to be practically co
operating and to nave opportunity to con
trol or influence the conduct of each other,
and have no superiority one over the oth
er, are they to be regarded as fellow-ser
vants.
The Bole in England and Slassa-
chusetts.
In England, and afterward In Massa
chusetts, the Legislature declared that
any person having charge of signal points
or of . an engine or train on a railroad
was a vice-principal. Mr. Justice " Holt
of the Supreme Court of West Virginia
In noting this fact remarks: "It Is signi
ficant as tending to show that both re
gard themselves as having gene astray
in holding the conductor of the railway
train to be a mere servant." This change
has been made for the reason that "It is
the duty of the master to conduct the
train in person or by an agent, mak'ng
a vlce-pnncipal of the servant | or agent
who has charge or control of the engine
or train.' ' â¢,' , ..
Again, an engineer on â¢ one train of a
railroad company who is injured by the
negligence' of the conductor of another
train of the company running in an oppo
site direction is not the fellow-servant of
the -conductor. ~.
The Bole in Illinois.
The rule of co-essodation ' as a test of
fellow service has been offered In. Illinois.
On one occasion an Injured servant was
obliged to take and record the numbers
of cars coming into a station. -This work
was in the. engine yard. and. he was in
jured by an engineer who was running a
switching engine. They .were fellow-ser
vants., "Plainly," the court says, "this
engineer and car numberer were fellow
servants. There was a mutual and neces
sary " connection - between the classes of
service they rendered." bringing them into
contact with each other In the same place
In the execution of the master's business.

which ,waÂ« the,; pursuit common to both,
and they were under common pay and
control of that master, and it is no matter
that their work was dissimilar. Neither
was the agent of the master as to the
other." j
This Is in harmony with the early rule
of Massachusetts, which was thus stated
in the case of Gilman vs. Eastern Rail
road: "In case of an injury to one ser
vant by the negligence of another. It is
immaterial whether he who causes and
he who sustains the injury are or are not
engaged in the same or similar labor, or
In positions of equal grade or authority.
If they are acting together under ona
master in carrying out a common object
they are fellow-servants." This, how
ever, as we have just seen, haa beea
changed by statute.
Application of the Buls to a Factory
Operator.
j This rule was afterward applied ta a
{ superintendent and operative in a cotton
factory. What do cur readers think the
court decided? It was held that they. too.
were' reliow-servanta. ami consequently
the operative failed to recover from the
company for an Injury caused by tha su
perintendent's negligence. The court said
it cannot affect the principle that the
duties of the superintendent may be dif
ferent, and perhaps may be considered of
I a somewhat higher character than those
of the operative: inasmuch a~Â» they -are
both the servants of the same master,
have the same employer, are engaged in
the accomplishment of the same general
object, are acting in one common service,
and derive their compensation from the
same source.
The courts of West Virginia would have
decided this question very differently, for
surely the operative "was under the con
trol and subject to the orders" of the
superintendent, and this separation be
tween them was sufficient to create the
relation of superior and subordinate; in
other words, there was no fellow-servtce
between them. What would the courts of
other States do with this question now.
for the decision was made quite fifty
years ago?. Many of them doubtless
would follow, the West Virginia rule and
hold that the cnnrjnny was liable for the.
act of its superintendent.
The Ohio Kul*.
A decision was rendered in Ohio in IS54
wnich merits fuller notice. It -was thÂ»
case of a brakeman against a railroad
company who, had been injured by the
negligence of the conductor of the same
train. An elaborate opinion was rendered.
In. which the court remarks "that the
servant takes upon himself all the ordi
nary risks incident to the business, in
cluding liability to Injury from the negll
fence of other servants employed with
im by the common principal, but ' hav
ing no control over the business, or the
servant who receives the injury, we are
quite ready to admit. In such case they
stand to each other as equals and ar
alone liable for the injuries they inflict.**
After stating this rule the court proceeds
to lneuire what relation the brakeman
stand3 to the conductor; are they fellow
eervants. co-operating to the same end.
like half a dozen masons who are cutting
a stone or a gang of carpenters who are
working together In the absence of their
chief, or does the conductor occupy a su
perior position which prevents the crea
tioa of any such Idea as that of fellow
service? The court has no difficulty In
finding an answer. They are not feiiow
servanti. This conclusion rested wholly
on the idea that the company from tin
very nature of it3 contract of service with
its employes was under obligations to
them, as well a3 they to the company.
Among them were the obligations to su
perintend* and control, with skill and care,
the running- of its trains. For this pur
pose the . conductor was .employed. **arjU
in this he directly represented the com
pany." They commission him to exercise
that power over the operation of the train
which essentially pertains to the owner,
-and In >Â«:xercfcÂ«iiwr if" he stands esseattetty
_tn its- place. This service is not coEfflen
to him.' and the handJ haVe nothing to a.>
\rith It. "His duties and theft- duties are
entirely separate and distinct, although
both are necessary to produce the result.
It is his to command and theirs to obey
and execute. No service Is common tfcnt
does not admit of a common participation,
and no servants are f el tow-servants where
one Is placed in control over the other." :.
Common Laborers.
A case has come before the Suprexa
court of Florida In wuJch the same quj*
tlon was again considered. A common ta
borer was injured by the negligence of an
engineer. Were they feilow-servants? Th*Â»
court drew a line between the engineer
and the other employes of the company.
"If one were engaged as a common labor
er tÂ» work on the roadbed or gTavel train
he could not be a fellow-servant with tho
engineer or conductor of a passenger
train, but would be a fellow-servant wltfe
all employed on the roadbed or gravel
train If his employment was In a common,
work and brought him in immediate coiv
tact with them and risk through them."
This distinction is clearlr stated by the
court. One of a gansr of men may be the
fellow-servant of the others exeunt the
foreman, and if injures by them there Is
no remedy against the company, but if
injured by the foreman he can recover
against the company because he Is not r*
fellow-servant with them, but the agcRS.
vice principal or representative of the
company. Such is the law in that JStata
and in many others. Dut not in all. Wa
have seen that there are wide departure
in the States aa with "respect to felloe
servants.: In general the Western State?
are Inclined to narrow the relationship

the tendency is to regard foremen and
other directors of men as fellow-servants
unless it is very plain that they cannot
be thus classified.
What tests shall be applied to determine
when they are fellow-servants and when
not? Various ones, as we have seen, have
been applied. In some of the States tlia
Courts say that a foreman, to constitute
him vice principal, must have controi of
the men. with power- to employ and dis
charge them, in .Â©rd-tr to make his em

NEW YORK. Jan. 22.â The influences fn the
rtock market resolved themselves to-day into
several distinct component parts, which op*i
ated in conflict a part cf the time and never
in clearly defined % concert. There was a
palpable effort on foot to open prices high. In
fact brokers in a number of stocks admitted
the receipt of orders to make first price* as
blrh ae ponslble. This Is a familiar device of
traders who have cone long of stocks during
a rise on one day to get the greatest possible
benefit from the relapee. The opening In
prices of the stocks which were most palpably
manipulated yesterday disclosed the operations
of this claes. St. Paul and Northern Pacific
were conspicuously affected in this way, tne
former open;pc up 1\ and the latter rising al
most as much and then running. off again to
near last night's level. The eame stocks came
tttt* pi-fpiii'titnrf. ataln late in the day after
tie news haci been received of Queen Vic
toria's death. This event . had been} bo defl
ritely foreseen there was little reason to ex
pect that its actual announcement would cause
any marked depression in the market, but ap
parently there was a speculative element who
feared the possibility of selling Induced by the
Queen's death. After that event was reported'
there was a pause in the activity of the mar
ket, as though awaiting its effect on prices,
and shortly atterward rooms traders set to
work to bid up prices again. They lifted St.
Taul an txireme 414 points over last night
Northern Pacinc 2^ and the Grangers, Pacifies,
trunk lines and more prominent stocks gener
ally from 1 to 2 points. The same traders were
active In Sugar all day. making the extreme
advance 21Â». On the other hand' the sensa
tional movement in Missouri Paclfia was
brought to a sudden etop after a three-point
Jump at the opening, and the Wabash stocks
also fell back. The extreme decline In Mis
souri Pacific was 714, and It closed at a nel
loss of 314. This action of the stock naturally
cauaed some Incredulity regarding the many
rumors afioat yesterday of a coming consoli
dation of the Southwestern railway systems
and of buying by a prominent capitalist for
control. The other members of the Southwest
ern group were, however, well sustained, and
th* absorption of Wabash debenture bonds con
tinued on an enormous scale and at a price
lf-vel above that of yesterday. Missouri â¢ 1 a
clflc was in urgent demand In the loan crowd
and commanded as high as 1 per cent premium
for use by the shorte. This . gave . color to the
belief which was avowed by some of the trad
ers that the buyinr rf the stock had resulted
In a corner. - leaving a very heavy short In
terest with their requirements unprovided for.
Amalgamated Copper again moved widely.
.lumping nearly 1 3 points at the opening and
then failing back 2K. The steel nocks were
comparatively neglected, but the undertone Â«u
weak in spite of the less threatening utterances
authorized by trade magnates. Federal Steel
fell away 2%. and other members of the group
from 1 to JH after small opening advance*.
The late notable rise was not well maintained,
especially !n the storks which were - bid up
Tnoet aggressively, and the closing was active
and rather eaÂ«y below the best. The level of
Trices at the dose was substantially â¢ higher
than yesterflay % The undertone of the market
during the lay* was heavy. .. ' , .

I CHICAGO, Jan. 22. â Wheat went up lc yes
terday. To-day the stuff bought the previous
session was sold and the market dropped back
to the place It occupied Saturday. The mar
ket was . largely a local one. May wheat 1
opened H<9%c lower at H%@U%c and soon
after touched 75c. The Initial depression was
based on the fact that Liverpool showed a de
cline in the face of the advance here the day
before. Northwest receipts were large and it
was- generally believed that reports of yester
day's export business had been exaggerated,
all j of which added to the . depression. Â¦ The
market struggled along for two hours between
7414c and 75c without any particular pressure
being â¢ exerted against the price.- The heavy
primary receipts and the failure of any cash
demand to put- In an appearance later caused
renewed selling and May dropped to 74VÂ»c and
closed weak, 1ST 1 He under yesterday.
Corn was quiet and easy in sympathy with
wheat. The demand was scattered. May
corn closed 3V4c â¢ lower.
Oats were weak. May closed %<QMc down

Provisions were moderately ] active, but
showed an undertone :>Â£ heaviness. The open

TUESDAY, Jan. 22â2 p. m.
Business in local stocks and bonds was quiet
on the morning session, with no change worthy
of note, and the eame conditions prevailed in
the afternoon.
On the morning session of the Oil Exchange
Monarch of Arizona and Petroleum Center were
the leading stocks at steady prices. In the
afternoon Kern advanced to $12Â®12 60.
The Central Point Consolidated Oil Company
will pay a dividend of 2c February 1.
The Fireman's Fund Insurance Company has
declared the usual, quarterly dividend of 3 per
cent, payable immediately. '.
The Oceanic Steamship Company will pay a
dividend of 60c per share on February 1.
Harrison's circular says: 'â¢Since January 1
the following coal cargoes from Australia have
been delivered here, viz.: Saint Anne. 2200
tons; Celtlcburn. 42?3 tons; Montgomeryshire.
2150 tons: Duchalburn. 3104 ton/; total. 11.737
tons. The list of chartered vessels for coal
from Newcastle and Sydney have shrunk to
twenty-three, with a carrying capacity of
about 72.000 tons. This is 54.OCO tons less than
five months ago, which is unquestioned evi
dence of the shrinkage of Colonial shipments.
Engagements for coal are becoming rare, al
though there has been a pronounced decline in
rates of freight, but -this has been more than
overcome by the . advanced price of coal, in
addition to which Is' the delay caused carriers
awaiting their turn. These obstacles com
bined make Newcastle an undesirable port for
vessels to seek business, and will compel our
local consumers to divert their orders to the
coast products. Some few of our large con
sumers would Â¦ prefer . to confine themselves to
the Australian grades if they were assured a
tegular supply, and would prefer its use even
at a higher cost to the British Columbia, but
it Is questionable* if the existing situation would
warrant their doing so. Fuel oil has become
a ; pronounced factor as a steam producer
throughout the State, and its effect will be
felt more acutely later on in the year; this
is obvious- to every one In the trade. It la be
coming an assurance that for five years at
least; the wells opened and being sunk, will
give consumers an ample â¢ supply."

At the same time there Is a demand for cash

The Buenos Ayres correspondent of the Lon

lack at moisture.
"Reports from all sections indicate that early
rown grain is In the best possible condition,
end th'iURh not making very rapid growth, is
rtrong and healthy, having been benefited by
lavoreWf ondltions thus far through the seÂ«
*cn. A large crop of wheat and barley has
lÂ»en Bown in all pa'ts of the Slate, and this
largo acreage Is being Increased as rapidly as
Â«eath<r permits. Grass is also In excellent con
dition. Pro*pe<-ts are rood Â«t the present time
for heavy crops of grain and hay In all sec
tlnnr. Plowing and reeding are In progress In
ail places where the poll hÂ«Â« dried sufficiently.
"Orchartlists and vlneyardlsts have made
considerable progress in pruning. Trees and
vines are looking well, and have also been
brmT.ted by cool m-^ather. So far as can be
ascertained, the severe frosts at the beginning
of the month have caused no material dam

Peterson, superintendent of the company,
lies In bed at his home severely burned
about the head, legs and arms, and an
Italian, whose name could not be ascer

sonsetiir-g to bÂ« marveled at. as he was
blown clear cut of the phed under which
the rank was located and was picked up

Th# steel tar.k originally contained

Peterson was hurled twenty feet, luckily
jrolng through the shed opening instead of
6j?ainÂ£t a wall. He was taken to his
home, where Dr. T. B. Roche, who was
eursrnoned. dressed his burns. Peterson

It is hard to account for the explosion,
but it Is thought that perhap3 the powder

with Rltrorlycerin and that some of thlÂ»
explosive remained In it when it was re
turned, forming a gas when mingling
with the hot tar.
NORMAL SCHOOL SITE

Under Supreme Court Decision Sn
pervisors Have No Power in the
Premises.
"When the ordinance granting the use of
the lot adjoining the Girls' High .School
to the State Normal School Trustees for
the erection of a normal school -building
comes up for final passage at next Mon
day's meeting of the board It will in all
likelihood meet with opposition on the
part of some of the members. Chief Clerk
Russell directs attention to a Superior
Court cecls!on regarding Hamilton
Square, which formerly embraced the
property proposed to be deeded away.
The court in July. 1S75. held in the. case
of Samuel McCuIloug-h vs. the Board of
Education that the resolution of the Board
of Supervisors assuming to authorize the
Board of Education to appropriate a por
tion of this square for the erection of a
schoolhouse thereon, though passed In due
form, was inoperative because the board
had no authority to grant a public square
for that purpose. It is claimed that the
deeding- away of the lot in question Is
illegal on that account.

FATAL DUEL IH AN
ABIZONA SAXOON
TUCSON". Ariz., Jan. 22.-Ex-Sheriff
Beeler of "Apache County shot and killed
Montis Slaughter and Injured Clare Peary
In a row at Sprlngerville. The ex-Sheriff
and Slaughter had been enemies for some
time and when they met a few days ago
they talked over their quarrel in a Joking
wa>v*but soon entered into a heated, argu
ment from which Slaughter retired, say
ing as he left the saloon where the men
met: '! -' . Â¦ '..Â¦ ,
"I'll be back in a few minutes and I'll
fix you."
Beeler fixed himself before Slaughter re
turned by procuring a shotgun. "When
Slaughter returned to Sam Saffley's he
came In at the doer, raised his Win
chester and fired at Beeler. but missed,
whereupon Beeler seized his shotgun and
called out to . Peary, who was , standing
near the door. "Get out of the way, Peary.
I don't want to have to kill two men"
He then fired and Slaughter, who wa*
about to fire a second shot, fell dead
and some stray shot from the charge took
effect in Peary's side; making a painful
but not'dangerous wound, although had
It not been for the shot striking his six
shooter's handle there would have been
two dead men.

Little Albert Dale Succumbs
After Nearly an Hour
of Agony.
BERKELET. Jan. 22.â Albert "William
Dale, the 5-year-oid aon of A. C. Dale oi
1323 Fifth street. Weat Berkeley. wa3
choked to death this morning: through get
ting the round top of a kerosene oil car*
stopper lodged In hJ3 windpipe. He died
after three-quarters of an hour of violent
coughing.
At M o'clock the child started down
stairs for hfs breakfast- He commenced
conghlng- and when he reached his mother
on the lower floor was in a state of con
vulsion. He was unable to sseak. Hl3
little sister said that he had swallowed
something, but In the absence of knowl
edge the mother was enable to render
any assistance. Medical aid was sum
moned, but the child was past all help.
The tin that caused the ehOd'3 death
was round and about the size of a half
dollar. It fitted perfectly. over the open
ing of the trachea and when removed by
the autopsy physician. Dr. J. B- Hoax
land, .was in. such a position as to pre
clude all afr from the luntrs.
During the convulsive movements of the
child, caused by violent coughing-, the tin
was forced ui> and down, thus admitting
a small auantity of air to the lungs. At
each Inward gasp the tin gradually
worked down, slowly smothering th*
child, until finally it fixed It3elf perfectly
over the trachea.
Dr. Hcagland performed the autopsy
this afternoon. He said : "When the child
first swallowed the tin had hÂ© been taken
by the heels and shaken .Tlgorously he
would probably have been relieved of is.
His convulsions, however, had a tendency
to draw it down closer and firmer.** "
A. C. Dale, the father of the child. Is a
cigar-maker in San Francisco. The in
<ruest will be held to-morrow evening.

Young Mrs. Allen Declares
That a Spiritual Bond
Unites Them. *
"Marriage is only a man-made affair."
argued Mrs. Allen. "The union of souls
is another consideration far removed from
the civil laws which only bind in the eye*
of the world, 'we are united by a strong
er bond. It is that of a spiritual affinity,
which means infinitely more than 1 the
marriage by man. I shall not recognize
the man who calls me. wife, for that is a
mere word which carries - nothing truly
celestial with it." s . , . .
In that strain did the -young wife try
to combat the earnest efforts of the police
officials to Induce her to part- from the
man who had Inveigled her away.- - â¢
Allen Is nearly distracted by the pecu
liar * attitude his wife has assumed. He
has nothing but pity and sorrow for her.
But he feels that the man be has accused
lured his spouse away and gained an ad
vantage over her? by a studied line of mis
representation and deceit. ~
"Reade told my wife I had mortgaged
all of our belongings and was "spending
the money recklesaly," said Allen.' "He
made all sorts of. statements about me
and by that sort of action slowly gained
his evil influence over her, sick as sns
was. She need not come back to me. All
I ask now is that ' she go to her parents
and her brothers, who will try to shield
her as much as possible."- -
Allen Is awaiting the certified copy of
his -marriage certificate "for. use in the
prosecution of Reade should attempt, be
made to deny, the legal- union, Reade was
in the Police Court- to-day .for arraign
ment, but upon request of his counsel a
continuance of a day Â¦ was granted.
Reade" s bail is fixed at 1500 cash. He has
telegraphed to his banker' at Winnipeg
for money. The prisoner refuses to make
any, explanations. Â¦- Â¦ â¢ -
To Chief cf Police Hodgkins, who has
taken a kindly interest in the case be

announced her intention to remain in
Oakland until the ' prosecution of Reade
was ended. '"'-J-H' . â¢
Such was the^ reply the husband was
given this morning when he made his sec

leave the man. he 'had imprisoned. .
"If you try to force me to return, hoxre
I shall end my life. I have the means at

unless I am unmolested."
The woman has flatly and energetically

Harry Barker, a resident of this city,

sentenced to twenty-five years' imprison
ment in the State prison at Folsom. was
ordered released from the penal institu
tion yesterday by the Supreme Court.
Barker, handcuffed and in charge of
Warden Wilkinson, was brought before
the appellate court yesterday on a writ
of habeas corpus filed by Attorney N. S.
Wire. Thf writ recited that Barker had
been convicted on November 25. 1S93. of
grand larceny and sentenced to twenty
five years' imprisonment, and that the
sentence was excessive, as the maximum
penalty for the crime of prand larceny is
fixed by the statutes of this State at ten
years. As there was no prior conviction
against the prisoner and as he had served
seven years and was allowed three years
for credits for good conduct Barker was
improperly held. The court was of this
opinion ar.d ordered his discharge.
As the manacles were taken off Barker

Missing Wife and Her Com:
panion Go to Jail at
Point Richmond.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1115 Broadway, Jan. 22.'
Upon the accusation of M. R. Hubbard
of the Truckee. Republican, C. A. Cox. a
building contractor, Â»nd Huhbard's wife
were arrested to-night at Point Richmond
by Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
and taken to Martinez to answer charges
of adultery and larceny. : The arrests form
a climax to a story of desertion and elope
ment, much of which is yet wrapped in a
cloud of mystery- vÂ« - -
The wife was Luella Hoyt. daughter- of
former State Senator Hoyt, then of Val
lejo. now a resident of Benicia. The at
tachment between Cox and. the woman,
according to Hubbard's story, sprang up
within a year and a half after the news
paper man made her his bride at Yallejo
in 1SSS. Â¦ .... ....
The charge of theft Is based upon Mrs.
Hubbard's alleged purloining of her sis
ter'* Â«vatch when she disappeared . from
Vallejo. Cox is said to have abandoned a
wife and child at that time. :
As the accusing husband's story runs,
he and his wife lived happily for a. year
or so after their marriage. Shortly after
the death of their baby daughter Mrs.
Hubbard seemed for a time to have suf
fered mental aberration through grief, but
this condition began to pass away. Hub
bard soon afterward went to Truckee and
plans were laid for his wife to follow as
soon as he was settled.
About that time, declares Hubbard. Cox
appeared at Vallejo, accompanied by a
wife, and child in a company outfit. He
pitched his caravan in a vacant lot ad
joining the â¢ Hoyt residence, where Mrs.
Hubbard was staying. Cox manufactured
chowchow. peddling It about town. ,
One day Hubbard received word from
the Hoyts that Mrs. Hubbard had sud
denly left, and Cox had also disappeared.
For twenty-one months neither the hus
band nor the family heard from the miss
ing wife. A few weeks ago the Truckee
ite was astounded to receive a letter from
his i spouse, dated Point Richmond, an
nouncing that she was ready to return to
him. In reply he addressed letters in. her
own name, but they were uncalled for-
None in Point Richmond knew that the
woman who had been Introduced, for., a
year as Mrs. C. A. Cox was the' erring
wife. Hubbard knew nothing of the truth
until, falling: to receive an answer, â¢ he
came to Point Richmond to Investigate.
Then the situation was revealed. ~
With considerable effort Hubbard re
strained himself from taking the law Into
his. own* hands, and appealed to the Dis
trict Attorney at Martinez. The warrants
were issued by Judge W. Lindsey at San
Pablo. Bail was fixed at JIOOO for Cox and
$300 for Mrs. Hubbard. Neither will talk
about the charges. Cox and his compan
ion went to Point Richmond last August
from Bakersfleld. as far as can be learned.
Hubbard has yet to learn what became of
his wife during the Interim between her
departure from Vallejo and her arrival in
Point Richmond. . ' . â¢. :f;

The Rev. Willism Bader So Advises
. Young Men in Talk on ""Uncle
Sam 1 and Common
Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦. - People." â¢
The Rev. William Rader delivered an
address last evening ai, the Turk-rstreet
Temple before a large audience, thei sub
ject of his discourse being "Uncle Sam.
or the Reign of the Common People."
The sneaker in opening his address
said: "It Is the duty of every, man to
take part in politics, because- he is one
of the people and the people represent the
government. While a popular government
may not always be a righteous one, yet
it becomes such because there is the ca
pacity for self-government In the hands
of the people. The Government of\ Uncle
Sam will always remain safe because its
foundation rests with the common people
who know how to think and act. It is
the duty of every man to have a home,
for a man without a home is a man
without a country. Every man in Amer
ica is as good as his home and no bet
ter. The home reflects the true character
of the man- and the homes of a country
are its bulwarks."
The speaker dwelt on the influence of
the New England homes, and said that
Uncle Sam would never have been able
to accomplish anything if it had not been
for his wivesâ the wpmen of America.
The "new woman" was - ridiculed by the
'speaker, and so was the "woman of fash
ion." who had no thoughts beyond those
of dress, feathers and hats, he said.
'â¢Rather than marry a woman of fash
ion." said the Rev. Mr. Rader. "a young
man would better buy a sawdust doll and
take it home."
The religious views of the community
were dwelt on by the Rev. Mr. Rader,
who nleaded for common sense . in all
thoughts and deeds. The common people
were the mainstay of the country, and
America had produced distinct types in
politic*, the army and navy, science, pro
fessions and commerce. The greatest
men of the country had come from the
common people. When the people were
roused in America the whole world knew
of it. and recently Uncle Sam had risen' in
his might and avenged a wrong by sweep-
Ing the last vestige of Spanish rule from
the western hemisphere. It would be a
great thing if Uncle Sam would again rise
in his prowess and sweep away many
wrongs which exist in the country to-day.
The rulers of thl3 country constitute
"Uncle Sam." and he is the common peo
ple. There is no place fora King of any
kind in this country, and ev^j-y . boss in
Federal, State or municipal government
should be kicked out.
The address of the Rev. Mr. Rader pro
voked hearty applause at times, and at
its close a vote of thanks was passed to
the lecturer.

BEAL ESTATE TBANSACTIONS.
VICTORIA. B. C Jan. 22.â News -was
brought by the steamer Victoria to-day
of the Io3s of the German steamer Saih
sang, on the Yangtse. Th* steamer left
Icbang for Chunking at daylight on De
cember 27. Jest above Ichang begin the
Yangtse gorges, very fine from a scenic
point of view, but dangerous to naviga
tion on account of the rocks and rapids.
The steamer was in command of Captain
Breitag and there were seven foreign pas
sengers and twenty-one missionaries re
turning to Scechuen on board. She parsed
the Ichang gorge ana the Tatung rapids
easily and arrived at noon at the entrance
of the splendid Xlcoukoang gorge, forty
five miles above Ichans- The river here
Is full of sharp rocks and turns round a
cliff. The steamer proved to be too long:
She knocked against a hidden rock and
began to sink.
The Chinese crew became frightened
and jumped Into the lifeboats, which were
capsized and many were drowned. Owing
to their desertion it was impossible to run
the steamer ashore. Chinese sampans
hastened to the assistance of the steamer
and took the passengers ashore. All the
Europeans were <aved. The . captain
stayed on board bravely to the last and
unfortunately waa among the victims of
the wreck. The Saihsan? was seen to
drift domn with her stern raised perp*n
dieularly T above the water and after an
explosion disappeared entirely, with thÂ«
captain still on her.

Sinks With Her.

GOES TO THE BOTTOM
The Sheriff secured the pledge of the
Constable that be would assist In guard-
Ing the prisoner if the irons were left off
The Sheriff consented and left his pris
oner with the Constable for a moment
while he placed the irons back In his grip.
As soon as the Sheriffs back was turned
Stiles made a dash for liberty and Sheriff
Lewis tried to recapture his man. but was
prevented by the Constable, who stepped
between the Sheriff and the fleeing Stiles.
Stiles gained the open air and got away.
Sheriff Lewis offered considerable
money for help in securing Stiles, but no
one would volunteer to assist him and he
made the search of the settlement alone,
but without avail.
TUCSON, Jan. 21â By the treachery of
a Constable Sheriff del LÂ«wis last night
lost a prisoner and o.-.e he could not afford
to -let slip from hisM&ods. It appear*
thai the people o# Cochlse County are not
satisfied with the ratber mysterious man
ner in which Billy Stiles was turned loose
after contesting that he took part In train
holdups and attempted to take the life of
George Hravin. jailer at Tombstone. But
Stile4, for turning- evidence against bis
companions, bad to be rewarded and was
turned loose and allowed to go back to
his Casa Grande home, whleb he did.
A few days ago Sheriff del LÂ«wia
passed through Tucson with a warrant
for Stiles, charging him with an attempt
to kill Jailer George Bravln. He found
Stile? In a saloon arid with the Constable
of the town went to make the arrest.
Sheriff Lewis handcuffed his man and was
about to put irons on him also when tbe
Constable made an appeal for Stiles, on
the ground that Kls wife and mother lived
in' Ca.Â«a Grande and be had many friends
there who would not like to see him leave
bound In irons.

A CRUSADE against vice, "as radi
cal in its aim as that inaugurated
in New York by- Bishop Potter,
may be stirred up in this" city
through the medium of a sermon
preached by the Rev. Frederick W. Clam
pett. D. D.. rector of Trinity Church, in
Grace Church yesterday morning at the
flfty-flrst convention of the diocese of Cal
ifornia. The sermon was a masterpiece of
forensic ability, and scintillated with epi
gram. Staining charges, couched in' no
uncertain terms, were launched against
this city. Vice was declared rampant,
and the Sabbath day. only a name. Plead
ing for the holding of home ties Inviolate,
the speaker laid the cause for much mari
tal misery and many desolated hearts at
the door of the existing law of divorce,
and called on the ministers of God within
the sacred precincts to bring all the force
of their argument * and power of their po
sition to amend legislation relative to di
vorces, the saloon, social evil and dese
cration of the Sabbath day.
Some of the pastors, he said, had
placed themselves in battle array against
vice, and to such all honor should be
given; but he declared others there were
who. wrangling over petty questions of the
schools, had fallen into the "ruts of
dogma and were remaining in the shal
low waters of ceremonialism, \%en the
voice of the master called them forth into
the deep tide of intelligent, aggressive
.work.''
The church was declared "tp have
reached a point in her history- where,
backed by centuries of experience, she
took a part and became a power in moral,
social and civic questions. "The tone
of the church bells on the Sabbath day
is smothered by unhallowed revelry of
i open saloons and gambling dens, and your
opera and theater," said the speaker.
The text of. the sermon from the gos
pel of St. Luke. v:4, was 1 "Launch out
into the deep." The sermon was in part
as follows:
Duty in New Century.
The birth of the new century in our world's
history and the beginning of the second half
centennial of our diocesan life must create in
I every - thoughtful mind the conviction - that- a
crlels has been reached. The man who goes
forth to plan and to strive for the growth of.
the kingdom can no longer be called a dreamer.
He has nineteen centuries of the kingdom's
history behind him â he has the eternal weight
of divine prophecy before him. â¢ %
It requires no great power of observation to
note the marvelous changes which are making
for the hastening of the kingdom. The Chris
tian faith must now undergo the nevere test
under euch changed conditions. In asserting
The citizens* committee appointed by

and< so sure as God lives in his church his di
vine blessing will rest on our labors in the
years to coir.e.
Hut we are reminded at this Juncture of an
other crucial element, demanding a wider area
of attack. It will be found in the growing
assertion on the part of the church over. civic,
social and moral questions. The positive
power of church life In direct Influence upon
great moral, social and ethical questions has
reached the farthest point In her history. The
burning questions of employer and employed,
of capital and labor, of the housing of the
poor artisan, of the Influence of trusts ; upon
the public Interests, of the struggle against
the terrible evils of the liquor traffic, of the
crushing of vice In our city life, of the In
fluencing of legislation in matters concerning
the nation's weal, of the Just demand for hon
est men and capable In public offices, and
above all In the protection, purification and
permanency of the home by the demand for
proper legislation touching ; marriage and di
vorce. These questions form an- arena Into
which the church has boldly entered.
Sabbath. and Home Desecrated.
The powers of evil have assailed In this com
munity the two most vital parts of the body
corporate. The home â Its sanctity. Its purity â
has become amUnomer; the Sabbath' Is dese
crated to an extent that outrivals the Godless
ness of a Continental Sunday. The tone of the
church bells on that day Is smothered by the
unbalanced revelry of open saloons and gam
bling dens, by open opera and theater. Think
of the deadly effect which these things must
exercise upon the rising young manhood of the
community. We are called upon to take up
the watchword of â¢'Vigilance" In a city that
has one licensed liquor store for. every 13.% In
habitants. The first watchword then of our
church on the borderland of the new century
Is "Church extension," aggressive and un
flagging to the glory of God. The second
watchword Is "Vigilance." as we enter upon
every moral and social question affecting the
welfare of the community.

her perfect adaptability to the needs of every
nation under heaven. The missionary spirit is
awakening the church at large with a power
like that of Penticcst and the late honors In
the Orient have been as oil poured into the
flre of her enthusiasm. '
The supreme test before the church in the
years to come will be found In the answer to
the question: In how far does the church
prove her divine orlgln-and power by the be
stowal of the abundant life? Does she supply
tne deepest needs of men everywhere. A
practical age demands a practical answer. It
conies with the ring of a strong affirmation.
What statesman would have dared to
prophesy in 1S48, when the soil on which we
dwell was ceded by Mexico, that such a start
ling series of momentuous events would come
to nass; that this city of San Francisco should
be the outgrowth of half a century; that this
sentinel of the Orient should stand amid scenes
of unrivaled beauty, as a living witness to the
most marvelqus development of any age. It
sounds more like the weird story of a dream
than the realism of historic fact. But as we
turn from this picture of material prosperity
of commerce and agriculture, of mines and arts
and sciences to the profounfler considera
tion of moral conditions, there enters the vital
question.
Our highest duty, 'bur noblest privilege will
be at this convention to uplift the standard of
our .missionary enterpriseâ to place this entire
subject of active extension on a higher planeâ
to make our personal and voluntary promise
that we will plead directly with our people.
BISHOP NICHOLS. CHAIRMAN OF THE FTFTT-FIRST ANNUAL. STATE
CONVENTION OF EPISCOPALIANS, THE CLERGYMAN WHO DE
LIVERED A STRIKING SERMON AND SOME OF THE DELEGATES.
The statement made by The Call that
a number of "Walden's books were missing
and that the absconding Jute mill clerk's
peculations could never be estimated i3
substantiated. With this revelation comes
to light another demonstration of the
crooked and lax . administration at San
Quentin in the past.
A former official of the prison had the
audacity to admit, when cornered yester
day, that he' had ordered that all the
books, of the jute miil up to the year 1896
bo destroyed. They were carried by con
victs from the jute mill to, the furnace
fin the power-house and burned by his In
structions. The admission of this act on
the part of a man. who was once superin
tendent of the Jute mirtis followed with
a fitting climax. Expert MacLaren now
says that with the destruction of these
books all efforts to estimate the amount
of Walden's robberies from the State will
prove futile.
For several days the rumor has been
current that Walden's books were gone,
but Warden Aguirre as late as Monday
afternoon absolutely denied that such a
state of affairs existed. On that very
afternoon Aguirre had convict Price, em
ployed as a fireman in the power-house,
in his private office. Price then and there
told about the books being burned.
Agulrre, who professes to wish to have
the scandal thoroughly aired, was point
edly asked at the close of the private
examination of Price If I there were any
of Walden's books missing. He emphat
ically denied that there were. It has since
transpired that Price's testimony was suf
ficient to fix the responsibility of the
crooked act upon Charles Alden, who was
employed, in the responsible position of
superintendent of the Jute mill during
Warden Hale's administration.
Armed with the information of the de
struction of Walden's books, Prison Di
rector Wllkins and Warden Aguirre paid
an early visit to the city yesterday, ar
riving here from San Rafael on the 9
o clock boat. They were Joined by Prison
Director Fitzgerald. Charles Alden was
summoned to appear before them. When
Alden had completed his testimony the
prison officials wera appalled at the bold
methods that had been used to cover up
the traces of the systematic robberies that
had been carried on.
Alden's statement smacks of originality
and nerve, to express it in a mild way.
He claims that when he was superintend
ent of the Jute mill he came to the con
clusion that there were slxty-flveÂ«bales of
sacks missing. Being paid by the State
to do a little more than indorse his war
rant, It Is Inferred that he Instituted a
search for the missing bales. His search
proved fruitless, as he could not find the
much sought after bags. Deep down,
however, in the archives of his own office
in the jute mill he found a number of
books which had been used by AValden to
keep a record of the business of the mill.
A!den became enthused with the brilliant
Idea that these books took up too much
room In his office. After a careful scru
tiny of the contents of the volumes he
discovered that a. number of the pages
were missing' and that' they could not be
of any real interest to any one. Calling
In the assistance of some convicts, he or
dered the books carried to the furnace in
the power-house. Without any consulta
tion or without waiting for orders, Alden
ordered the volumes thrown Into the
"fiery furnace." With the burning of
these books all traces of Walden's crooked
dealings went up in smoke.
This trifling Incident, as Alden treats
the matter, occurred In June of 1S99, and
yet the matter was never reported or
known to the prison officials until yester
day. Alden's statement looks Innocent on
the surface. The prison officials will not
let. this deter them from trying to learn
more as to what caused Alden to destroy
the records of Embezzler Walden before
Agulrre, the new Warden of San Quentin,
should take official hold of the prison and
have all records turned over to him for
his personal examination.
Prison Director R. M. Fitzgerald was
interviewed at his home In Oakland last
evening. He admitted the discovery of
the loss of the books. Warden Agulrre
returned to San Quentin last evening.
He claims that he was so fatigued as a
tesult of hla labors in trying to unearth
the present scandal that he was unable
to see representatives of the press.
It is believed by some people that Wal
den is in Mexico. If any credence Is to
be- given to. the word of former convicts
WaTden planned his flight there several
years ago, when he feared that an in
vestigation was going to be made Into
his accounts. That he was robbing the
State, with the assistance of confederates
not connected with the prison, was a
matter known to many of the convicts.
They remained silent, however, for Wal
den wielded a tremendous Influence in
the penitentiary. They feared that if
they told of the robberies that were
coing on and were afterward unable to
prove the charges they would be made
to feel the power, of the thieving clerk.
None of them were in a position to bring
forward the necessary evidence to pTove
that Walden' and his friends were robbing
the State. While they were satisfied that
he was not only stealing manufactured
poods from the prison; but was also
stealing waste material, they realized
that their evidence would be questioned
unless supported by outslda testimony.
A few of them were interested in the
thefts. Walden from time to time gave
them small sums of monÂ«y with which
to purchase tobacco or any articles they
desired that were not on the prison list
cf supplies. , ,. .
While they were but poorly paid for
their silence and their service, they con
cluded that it was best, to allow matters
to run as they were running, for if they
made complaint against Walden and could
not prove what they alleged, they knew
too well that their lives would be made
harder to bear. The life of the. average
convict Is not a pleasant one, even when
he is a favorite of the Jail officials, but
when he Is not in favor there are many
ways of making him feel that he would
be "better off dead than alive. To carry
on his crooked work Walden was forced
to take several of the prisoners into his
confidence. â¢ They * had to haul the'un
marked bags from the jute mill to the
landing for shipment. They knew that
the bags shipped should come through' the
warehouse. Instead of the mills, but said
nothing. One of them said yesterday:
"Walden was a pretty. decent sort of. a
fellow. He gave us a few dollars now
and then. , We weren't working of our
own free will for the State, and if Wal
den was making a- little on the side It
wasn't any of our business." Â¦
About three years . ago something
happened to disturb Walden's. peace of
mind. He feared that 'an Investigation
was going to be commenced Into the man
agement of the Jute mills and. he. made
ready to get away before the crash came.
He told one of the convicts who enjoyed
part of his confidence that he Intended
"crossing over the border" if things com
menced to get too hot for him.
"I can get along- better in Mexico." said
he, "than anywhere else. If I have, to
get out. . I speak a half dozen 'languages,
and, as you- know.' I'm no -slouch as an
accountant.: I think that I have polish
enough about me to make friends of the
officials and If necessary they will help
me avoid extradition."
"Walden's fears were groundless at that
time, for . the -threatened lnvestigration
blew, over.,.In ;a/few iweeks he was , as
self-confident as ever before and resumed
his peculations' from, the prison. : .
'.'I. am satisfied," said a convict yeater
day, "that-Walden lost no time In getting
over the line when he left San Quentin.
He had a good start. Before there was
any. suspicion that. he did not intend re
turning, he had ample time to sret to Mex-
Jco.'- Once in . Mexico hÂ« would be safe,
for the extradition laws, do not cover
crimes similar to those committed by him.
Unless -the - Mexican Government . should
surrender him. there would be no possibil
ity: of extraditinsr -him. . "Walden- studied
up this- matter three years aÂ«ro and I am
RatlsflÂ»Â»d: that^wh^n hp left Son Quentin
