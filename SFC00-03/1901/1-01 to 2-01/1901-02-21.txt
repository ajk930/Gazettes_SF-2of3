PARIS. Feb. 20.â A remarkable paper
was presented before the Academy of
Medicine to-day. Dr. Lucas Champlon
nlcre demonstrated that one of the com

or influenza. Although this theory ha<l
been advanced by the late Dr. Simon of
the Hotel DIeu, one of the chief Paris
hospitals. Dr. Lucas Champlonniero's
statements have produced a profound sen
sation. The savant called attention to
the fact that an epidemic of appendicitis
has ever followed the grip epidemic, or
that the two often co-existed. He then
demonstrated that appendicitis is but the
localization of the grip affecting tho
intestines and often the appendix Itself.

reasons the text of the communication

response did not Indicate exactly when
an answer might be expected from the
British Government or the character of
the answer, hope Is entertained that the
British Government before the expiration
of the date allowed for the exchange of
the ratification of the treaty, namely,
March 4,' will take action either directly
upon the Senate amendments themselves,
or in the direction of extending the time
limit so as to continue the pendency of
the treaty.
Senator Morgan's resolution declares
that the ratification of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty is not a condition to legisla
tion by Congress for the construction of
the NIcaraguan canal. The majority of
the committee take the ground that the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty must be ratlfle.l
by Great Britain before any legislation
looking to the construction of the canal
can be enacted by Congress.
There could have been little hope that
Great Britain would ratify the pending
treaty with the practical threat hanging
over her that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
Â¦would be abrogated.

GUILTY OF KILLING
MILLIONAIRE L. R. DAY
The sole Question now at issue is
whether Mrs. Gorsage was sane when she
committed the terrible deed. Her at
torneys will try to prove that she was
mentally irresponsible. There is no Ques
tion, they say, that she had been in the
past dozens of times placed In positions
Â¦where she could have killed her husband
and been abundantly Justified on the
ground of self-defense.
"lie is better dead than alive," said
Mrs. Gorsage. when people, aroused by the
shot, rushed into the room and found her
with the smoking weapon in her hand
contemplating the body of the man she
hac". killed, "I am not sorry that I killed
him."
It Â¦was after reading this passage. At
torney DorÂ« will contend, that Mrs. Gor
eage, fired with a sudden resolution, roEe
from her seat, went to the place where
her husband kept his revolver, took it and
going to the door of the room where he
slept, placed the muzzle of the weapon
close to hi* head and f.red.
"What follows? The good people of

passage Is on page 77 and the book lay

"If that was the sort of civilization that
was being carried Into the Philippines."
Lentz said, "It would take $5000 to pre
vent cur soldiers from deserting."
Lentz' remarks roused the House to
fever pitch. Oraham (K.) of Pennsyl
vania challenged Lenlz to .produce the
letter he had referred to. He said he
thought it- existed only In the Imagina
tion of the gentleman from Ohio. Lentz
declared that the letter could not be pro
duced without getting the boy Into trou
ble. ,v \
Mahon compared Lentz to the "copper
heads" of lSbl and severely arraigned
him for what ho declared to VÂ« his en
couragement of deserters.
The House finally passed the sundry
civil appropriation bill to-day and entered
upon consideration of the general de
ficiency â the last of the general appro
priation bills.
"It is not possible that my colleague
will insist upon his objection.' said Gros
venor. 'He made an attack upon a dead
man r.nd I desire five minutes to reply."
"I did not make an attack upon a dead
man." replied Lentz. "I made an expose
of a live man. I have the proof here if
you desire to open up the subject."
Angered by Lentz' refusal to allow him
to be heard, Grosvenor. with flushed face
and uplifted arm, declared that the gen
.tleman from Ohio (Lenta) had been guilty
of a malicious falsehood. "And he knows
It," added Grosvenor.
A few mlnute3 afterward Lentz pro
posed that Grosvenor be given fifteen
minutes and he (Lentz) ten minutes.
"Oh, I object." called out Cannon. "If
gentlemen desire to wash their dirty lin
en, they should hire a hall."
A sensational eplsoda occurred when
the paragraph providing that not over J3o
should be paid for the apprehension of a
deserter from the army was reached. This
paraKiaph was seized upon by L.entz for
n base from which to attack what lie said
was Bolm; on In the Philippines and
which so c'lsgupted cur soldiers there that
they r.eserted. He declared that reports
were coming Jiack from the PnlHpninea
to th*j effect that our soldiers were killing
prisoners, and he said that he knew of a
letter received by the father of a soldier
In tho Philippines telling how a native
had been burled alive by his captors and
then beheaded.
Later Grosvenor tried to secure an op
portunity to reply to Lentz, but Lentz ob
jected unless twenly minutes were al
lowed on a f>lcio.
"I am not jumping on a dead man," re
plied I^entz. "but on a man who is so alive
that he will ride on Pennsylvania avenue
with the President cne week from Mon
day."
Lentz, an Ohio Democrat, who in this
and the previous Congress attacked the
administration, furnished the sensation.
He used a newspaper paragraph recount-
Ing the death of a Federal Judge In New
Mexico who had been a member of the
Legislature which elected Senator Hanna
as a text for charging corruption in that
election. This called for a rebuke from
Cannon, who declared that brave men
fought the living and only ghouls rav
ished the tombs of the dead.

IN THE HOUSE
Late 'in the day a sharp controversy on
the pneumatic tube question was precipi
tated by an amendment offered by Mason,
extending that ser-ice to Chicago, and
one by Vent, extending it to St. Louis.
Hale and others severelv criticized those
promoting the system, referring to a "Job
and lobby."
When the amendment appropriating
$SOO,000 for the transportation of mall by
pneumatic tubes and repealing the law
which prohibits future contracts for pneu
matic tube service, together with the
ponding point of order against it, was
called up, Mason offered his amendment
arproprlatlng $500,000 for the maintenance
of the pneumatic tube service, in cities
where it is now in operation' and for its
establishment in Chicago, provided taat
all future contracts for the establishment
of the service be advertised publicly. Ou
a vote the amendment was held to be In
order. 5* to 16.
â¢ Hale Interposed a point of order on the
ground that a committee had not passed
upon the proposition. The Senator added
some very 'severe remarks on the "gi
gantic lobby" alleged 'to be behind this
pneumatic tube plan. At this point Wol
cott gained recognition and said:
"I have Just been handed a communica
tion of rather Imperative characterâ the
most imperative that I recall in twelve
years.*" He then read a request addressed
to him by a large number of the Senators
of the Postofflco Committee, reading:
"Please call Immediate meeting of Com
mittee on Postofflces and Post Roads to
consider Mason's pneumatic tube amend
ment." â¢
Wolcott said that with such an Impera
tive request before him he would call the
meeting. In the meantime he asked that
the subject be laid aside and the request
was granted.
In the postoffice bill discussion Butler
contrasted the cost of railway mail pay
In Europe and in this country to the dis
advantage of the United States. Depew
interrupted to pay that the wages paid by
European continental railroads was only
about one-fourth of the rate of â¢ railway
wages In this country, while the freight
rates In this country were only ; a little
more than one- fourth of what they Were
in Europe. 'â¢.'Â¦?â¢Â¦ *. . Â¦_
"Does the Senator mean," Inquired But
ler, "that the American railroads are los
ing money?" 'Â¦Â¦-'". .. , '
"I do not mean to say. they are losing
money." replied Depew. "I mean to say
that If they had anything like the rates
charged for freight in Continental Europe
they could carry the mails. free and In
addition pay a largo revenue to the Gov
ernment." Â¦ : Â¦ Â¦- ,. Â¦Â¦ â¢ ,
No railroads in the world have larger
profits than those of the United States,
asserted Butler. â ' . _,
"The capitalization of railroads in Eu
rope," responded Depew, "Is much larger
than it is here. Â¦ In Great Britain It is
about $350,000 a mile. If that capitaliza
tion be reduced to the average capitaliza
tion in the United States you will find
that the profits of â¢ the English railroads
are enormous." ,
Wolcott said as to European railroads
carylng the malls free, that Jn Great Brit
ain the cost of railroad - mail transporta
tion was little less if any than here. In
Continental Europe ', the . Government
either owned the railroads or, guaranteed
the payment of. the principal. and Interest
of their bonds and of 5 or 6 per cent divi
dends on their -stock, whether they earned
it or not. â¢ ', .

TOPEKA, Kan*.. Feb. 20.â The vlpllance
of the officers Mias all that saved "Slick"
Slater from lynching by an infuriated
mob to-nlsht. He will yet be lynched if
he can be found.
Slater attacked 17-year-old Lottie .Ger
l>erick Monday evening and was captured
by Toneka officers the next day in Car
bondale. The officers kept the fact of the
capture, cuiet and placed Slater in the
County Jail here.
This afternoon It became known that
he was here and Immediately the Santa
I> shopmen, of whom the girl's, father,
Gecrfrp Gcrl>eri<k. Is onÂ«Â». decided that he
sliouid be lynched. They nt once sent a
committee to watch thÂ» Jail, while they
quietly arrar.s>>d the details of the ex
pocted lynching. By C o'clock there was
a mob of ICr.X) men around the County Jail.
d- mandlng that th<Â» prisoner be delivered
to them. A J-Tipado of sturdy Santa Fe
bollrr-makcrs. armed with heavy sledge
hammers, stood ready to make short work
of the ja:l in case the demands were not
Kxant<vl.
Sheriff Cook told the crowd that the
prisoner had been removed and offered to
let a committee search the jail. Ten men,
hcaot'd by George Gcrberick, made a thor
ough search, but Slater could not be
found. They returned and told the mob,
but that failed to satisfy them, and twice
they started to break down the jail doors.
It developed that early in the afternoon
the Sheriff, in anticipation of trouble, or
dered a deputy to get Slater out of town.
He was ordered not to leave him In Jack
son County or take him to Leavenworth.
The deputy drove to Hoyt with Slater
and boarded a. north-bound Rock Island
train with him. It is thought here to
night that Slater is now In jail in Atchl
son.
The Santa Fe shopmen are determined
to lynch Slater when lie' Is broupht back
here for trial. They - have appointed a
large vigilance committee to be constantly
on the lookout and vow that Slater will
never leave Topeka alive. The Santa Fe
Fhopm'-n have a past record in cases of
tiiis kind. They lynched John Oliphant
twelve years ag.t for a like offense.
The County Jail, which the lynching
party visited in- search of Slater, is the
tame one in which Mrs. Nation is con
fined. MrÂ»=. Xaiion was much alarmed at
the ccurse of the evening's events, but
fear for herself did not once enter her
mind as far as outward appearances
went.
The Law Enforcement army met at
the First Christian Church to-night and
on hearing of the nrojected attack on the
jail immediately sent a message to Sheriff
Cook saying that 3-<0 from the Law En
forcement League would be on the spot
to help to protect me jail from the fury
of the mob. This evidence of loyalty on
tfie part of her follower! highly pleased
Mrs. Nation and she expressed her pleas
ure with them in unmeasured terms.
Mrs. Nation said that the action of the
law enforcement people proved that they
were just what they claim to beâ people
anxious for the enforcement of law and
who would not endure the thought of a
lynching bcincr perpetrated here in To
peka. Mrs. Nation is pleased that the
officer? managed to get Slater away from
the fury of the mob so that he can re
ceive his punishment in the manner pre
scribed by law.

Columbus Dispatch, and Charles Rook,
llttsburg Dispatch.
A very important matter, which toolc up
a good part of the afternoon, was~the
question of arranging a scheme for arbi
tration In all labor disputes. This was
brought up In a report made by the spe
cial commissioner of the association, Col
cnel Frederick Driscoll. He referred to
the action of the International Typo
graphical Union, at Its annual meeting in
Milwaukee last summer, after whlcn a
special striding committee of the Pub
lishers' Association was appointed. This
committee Included Alfred Cowlea of the
Chicago Tribune, A. J. Lowensteln of the

Cormick . of the Chicago Times-Herald.
This special standing committee held a
meeting in Chicago last November, Jointly
with the active committee! of. the Inter
national Typographical JLJnlon. At that
meeting- an agreement . was formulated
Â¦Which will require that all labor disputes
in the office of a member of the Publish
ers' Association shall be submitted to ar
bitration. The agreement provides for
local boards of arbitration from which
appeal may be taken to a national board.
It is provided, however, that the national
board shall not take evidence, except by
a^vote of a majority of: the board. Rec
ords and briefs arc to be submitted, with
either an agreed statement of facts, or a
properly, certified transcript of -evidence.
Tending the decision of appeals, ' work is
to be 'resumed and the award of the na
tional, board may cover the entire period
from the time the, issues were raised. - -
Th^ national board' is to be composed "of
the president of the International Typo
graphical Union and the commissioner of
the American Newspaper Publishers' Â¦ As
sociation, who' In case of failure to agree
In any dispute shall name a third member
of the board. Expenses are to be borne
equally by, the two organizations. ;Â«
After Mr. Driscoll. the commissioner, for
the A.'^N. P. A., -had presented his report,
James ' M. Lynch, president of the I." T.
tj., said that, so far as he knew, all the
local unions were in favor of the agree
ment, which Is now being .voted on by
them. If the agreement . Is ratified '- by
both organizations. It .will go into effect
for one year. The association did. not
vote on the agreement to-day.

"WASHINGTON. Feb. 20.â After the prv-
llmlnary opening exercises at to-day's ses
sion of the National Society of the Daugh
ters of the American Revolution, a stir
was created when Mrs. Nesbeth of Mas
sachusetts presented a resolution to the
effect that the statements recently circu
lated attacking- the board of officers of
the D. a. R.. belnjr untrpe, Ubelous and
reflecting upon the honor of the organ
ization, should receive the disapproval of
the society. After some discussion the
resolution was laid upon the table.
Mrs. Dariel Manning presented her re
port as chairman of the committee on
the Continental Hall. The report showed
that from February 10. 1900. to February
10, 1901, there has been received toward
the fund $10,790. The fund now amounts
to $62,823. Continuing, the report says:
"Again, and for the last time. I urge
you to do your part toward this memo
rial of the men who counted no sacrlflco
too great for accomplishing our independ
ence. A building should be erected that
would be one of the finest halls In the
country, for It will represent 35.000 of tha
best women of America."
Mrs. Manning appealed to the members
of the congress to contribute two dollars
each. If this Is dor*, she said. $70,000 will
be raised. Contributions to a considerabla
amount were received for the Continental
Hall. Mrs. Donald McLean urged the
building of a permanent memorial hall.
She offered a resolution recommending
that a committee bo appointed to ascer
tain the minimum cost for which a site
can be secured and report the result of
its finding on the last day of the con
gres.*. It was adopted.
The President and Mrs. McKlnley ten
dered a reception this afternoon to the
Society of the Children of the American
Revolution, which was followed by a re
ception to the delegate? to the congress
of the Daughters of the American Revo

La Grippe and catarrhal troubles froa*
which I had suffered for years. I feel t^at

The first symptoms are those of acuto
catarrh, resembling a hard cold and if
prompt treatment Is applied at this time

every hour or two for two or three davs
the danger of pneumonia and serious com-
plications will be averted.

taking up the apportionment tJ.
this evening's session the Repub
lican Senators considered the
question In caucus, and there they agreed
on a plan that seemed satisfactory to all
concerned.
The Eighth Congressional District has
been changed by the latest plan so as to
include Tulare and Kings, which takes
away from the proposed Sixth District a
Democratic majority of 600. The first dis
trict was agreed upon as including both
Butte and Mendocino counties, and the
caucus adjourned to allow some work to
be done upon the sentiments of the Santa
Clara people so as to persuade them to go
in with the Sixth District.
Santa Clara wants to be with San
Mateo and the southern half of Sam Fran
cIfco, and there must be some earnest
persuasion before an agreement putting
that county into the Sixth District can be
reached. In case Santa Clara goes Into
the Sixth, then the southern part of San
Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Cruz
will make the Fifth.
Assembly apportionment was gone Into
far enough to decide to make a single As
sembly district of Tulare and Kings.
The bill, which gave each of them one

the two are consolidated It leaves an As

WIXFIELD. Kans., Feb. 20.â Noon to
day wa3 the time set by the crusaders
for the Jolntists of Winfield to close their
places on pain of having them demol
ished. The temperance people, however,
accepted a report of Mayor Bright *and
a committee of business men. who went
through the buildings vacated by the
jointlsts, that all had quit business, and
Issued a statement that hostilities would
cease until it could be seen whether the
Mayor would keep the Joints closed. By
this act it 13 believed that serious trouble
has been avoided, at least for the time
* Large crowds gathered on the streets
to-day waiting for "something to hap
pen" and the Marshal deputized several
dozen men to keep order and prevent any
attempt at saloon smashing. The people
were dispersed without trouble and the
day passed off quietly. Two Jolntists who
engaged in Saturday's tussle were arrest
ed and held on a charge of assault with
intent to kill. The County Attorney has
demanded the assistance of the city of
ficials in enforcing the law against liquor
selling. -Mayor Albright has arousexl
much Wttor feeing by referring to the
temperance people as "religious cranks."
WICHITA. Kans., Feb. 20.â A definite
plan has been formed here in case of a
raid on the saloons In the nighttime,
which Is expected to take place at any
moment, to call out the fire department
to reinforce the inadequate police service.
For, the purpose of quelling a riot the
firemen will be permanently clothed with
the authority of policemen, with power
to deputize citizens, at next Monday
night's Council meeting, and until then
it is understood that they have tempo
rary authority to make arrests. There
are twenty-six men In the fire department
so located that some of them can reach
any saloon In town within three minutes.
"1 would prefer to try a man on this
charge rather than a woman," said Judge
Hazen. "You may call a special venire
if you wish and I think it will be neces
sary. I expect to try only this one case."
Miss Madeline Southard and Mrs. Crist.
v:ho have been with Mrs. Nation In the
County Jail, gave bonds for $300 each
and were released. One of the signers
of the bonds was Edward Wilder, treas
urer of the Atchison Railway.
Stark Is charged with participating In
the raid on Murphy's Joint Sunday morn
ln<Â». He is employed in a hardware store
here. Stark's lawyer requested that his
client's case also go over for this term.
"I see. that If the cases go over until the
next term of court it will be difficult to
get a Jury. It will be better to settle 'the
point of law now. I shall call the case
against Stark on Monday morning."
Captain J. G. Waters, one of the attor
neys for the defense, asked that the cases
all be postponed until the next terra of
court: Judge Hazen said:
"Your Dishonor. I am incapable of try
ing my case this afternoon, as 1 have been
poisoned by cigarette smoke in the Coun
ty Jail. I want to see how the other cases
are tried, anyway."
The feature of tue hearing' thl3 afier
noon was the way In which Mrs. Nation
enlivened the proceedings. The dignity
hedging the judicial bench has no more
terrors for her than the commonest Joint.
She seems to treat both joints and courts
with utter contempt. She arose several
times to address the court and each time
called him "your Dishonor." When asked
if she were ready for trial, Mrs. Nation,
who acts as her own attorney, said:
â TOPEKA. Kans.. Feb. 20.â Judge Hazen
of the District Court to-day continued the
case of Mrs. Carrie Nation, charged with
smashing Murphy's Joint, until the April
term of court. The cases against Dr. Eva
Harding. Mrs. Rose Crist. Miss Madeline
Southard, Mrs. Chad wick and C. R. Mc-
Dowell were also continued.

NEW YORK. Feb. 20.â It was ascertain
ed to -lay that the Salt Lake and Baltair
Railroad, fifteen miles long, one terminus
of which ends in a .-.and heap, was re
cently sold to United States * Senator
Kearns of Utah. He did not want tho
road, but bought it to relieve tne Mor
mon church of an Incumbrance. Recent
ly, however, the Burlington people have
been negotiating for its purchase, and it
Is believed that, if sold, the Burlinffton
road will use it as its terminal at Salt
Lake City and extend It to Los Angeles.
This is not the first time the road has
been trotted forward as a possible rival
of the great systems of the Southwest.
Some time ago It was said that Mr. Hun
tington would extend the line to a con
nection T^th the Southern Pacific, but
this was reearded as aimed at the Union
Pacific. Later it was still reported that
United States Senator Clark had deter
mined io utilize it.
A call has been issued for a special
meeting of the shareholders of the Union
Pacific Railroad in Salt Lake City on
March 23 for the purpose of considering
an increase of the cauitnl stock of the
company. A proposition will be submitted
by tne directors for the issue of $100,000.
000 of new common stock In connection
with the proposed issue of $100,000,000 of
4 per cent bonds..
The shareholders will also be asked to
finally approve this Dond Issue and ratifv
the acts of. the directory In the acquisi
tion of new properties and all financial
matters pertaining thereto. For the pur
pose of this 'meeting 1 , as well as for the
purposes of I the dividends already de
clared, the stock transfer books Â¦will close
on February 23 and reopen March 25.
The proposed increase of the capital
stock of the Union Pacific will make the
entire capitalization of the company l^s -
178,700, of which $100,000,000 is preferred
stock. A large part of the new capitali
zation will doubtless ultimately cover tno
cost of the recently acquired controlling

Yesterday the stock of the Oceanic
Steamship Company declined several
points. The cause of the depression was
an assessment of ten dollars per share,
which was levied in order to provide
means for meeting interest obligations on
the bonds of the corporation.
By -the failure of the Cramps of Phila
delphia to complete, according to agree
ment, the three new steamships. Sierra,
Ventura and Sonoma, the Oceanic Steam
ship Company was forced to incur heavy
t-xpense in the employment of other ves
sels to maintain its obligations to carry
the mall3 pursuant to contract schedule.
The company was also deprived of the
earnings of the three new ships for a pe
riod exceeding eight months. '
It is claimed by Cramp & Sons that the
delay in completing the ships was caused
by labor strikes, the pressure of work un
dertaken for the Russian Government and
also by a prolonged term of unfavorable
weather, the heat being so oppressive
that the men employed at the yards could
delays, whether justifiable or not,
deprived the Oceanic Company of the use
of the new ships at a time when they
could have been used to the profit and
advantage of the company.
CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNERS
ARE READY TO, CONTEST
Three Teams Will Compete for a
Handsoriie Trophy on Wash

Everything is in readiness for the cross
country championship race which Is to be
Inaugurated to-morrow inornlng. The
officials have been chosen, the teams are
trained to the minute and the course has
been laid out to a nicety. The race will
be run over a course In Golden Gate Park.
It will start at the Baker-street entrance
of the park at 11 o'clock and the contest
ants will finish about 300 yards from tho
start. A handsome silver trophy has been
offered and the winning team will have
the honor of holding it for one year. The
cup must be won three times before It
can become the property of the victors.
Three teams will contest for the trophy.
The Oakland High School will enter 'a
strong aggregation. Stanford University
will send up her strong runners and the
Olympic Club will put forth her best
athletes. The teams are made up as fol
lows:
Oakland Highâ Westdahl, La Vallere, Lundy,
Reffired, Clough and Sullivan (substitute).
Colors, blue shirts.
Stanford â Schokke. Chadbourne, Pafjue.
Hamilton, .Taylor and Thomas (substitute).
Colors, red shirts.
â¢Olympic Club-Smith. Stone. Garcia, Klllan,
Taylor^ and Lamont (substitute). -
In Westdahl Oakland has a strong long
distance man. He is a midget, but the
way he can cover distances Is a wonder to
all beholders. He is very likely to be in
the forefront at the finish. The Stanford
athletes have been training faithfully for
the contest and expect to take the trophy
back to Palo Alto. Smith of the Olympic
Club Is an old Stanford miler and is like
ly to prove a dangerous competitor. Stone
and Garcia are worthy to wear the local
club colors. They are fast and gritty
runners.
The committee in charge of the race is
composed oi George James, Herbert
Hauser and John Elliott. Ten men. mar
shaled by "Jack" Hob.son, will line the
course and flag all along the route. The
race officials are as follows:
neferee, \V. , Oreer* Harrison; starter, John
Elliott: timersâ George P. Wetmore, Georga
Thomas, H. Hadenfeldt, William Mackie and
I. J. Muma: scorersâ J. W. Mullen. D. Brown

smith, C. Harris and A. M. Stone; clerk of
course, C. A. Cantwell;.- assistant clerks of
course, De Witt Van Court and George El
liott. Â¦
"Nobby" Otts and Fred Bell boxed at
137 pounds. Otts knocked his man out
early in the second round.
William Kelly and "Jack" McCarthy
furnished the wind-up of the card. Mc-
Carthy is very clever and didn't have a
glove put on him in the first or second
rounds. Kelly tried to mix in the third,
but was. very wild. The fourth was full
of action. McCarthy got the decision on
points.
"Sailor" Sharkey and George Hanrahan
came on next. Hanrahan was fat, couldn't
fight a lick and the bout was declared off
after one minute of fighting.
Fred Butler and George Sullivan met
next at 165 pounds. They cut out a hot
pace and went to the mat several times
in the first round. In the second round
Sullivan accused Butler of biting him. In
a" murderous mixup Police Sergeant Tobin
climbed Into the ring and Interrupted the
round. After a delay the battle was re
pumed. Butler stood an awful grueling
and was on the floor four times In the
third. round. He bit Sullivan repeatedly.
While the. crowd yelled and both men
were struggling on the canvas the police
stopped the fight. It took ten men to re
strain Butler. Sullivan won.
"Kid" Blass and "Mike" Smith fought
In the fourth event of the evening. The
men are novices. It took five rounds to
decide. Blass got the verdict. It was a
bad decision.
George "White and "Kid" Carter. 105
pounders, went on next. It was a kinder
garten fight. "White won.
Frank Nell and George Doherty donned
the gloves next. Both boys are shifty
bantams. The first round found both very
busy, with honors easy at the end. The
second round was furious. Nell dropped
his man with a hard right swing and he
took the count before coming back. Neil
had a shade when the bell rang. Xelther
man had any advantage in the third. In
the fourth Dougherty went down under a
etiff left. Upon putting up his hands Neil
landed a terrific punch on the stomach
and won the fight. It was a rattling con
test.
fast from the gong. Chinner had nothing
but a right swing in stock, but both landed
hard and often. Amid an uproar an extra
round was ordered. Stiff work was done
and the Judges called it a draw. Ward
should have got the decision.
FOLLOWERS of boxing are looking ,
forward with deep Interest to the
coming battle between Dal Hawk
ins and George McFadden. These
famous lightweights will box
twenty rounds before the Twentieth Cen
tury Club on the evening of the 28th. They
are training faithfully for the contest and
expect to enter the ring in shape to make
a fast battle.
Hawkins Is conditioning himself at the
Fourteen-Mile House. Reports from his
quarters show the Callfornlan to be In fine
rettle. Dal Is aware that In McFadden he
has a hard game. He Is therefore leaving
nothing undone to put himself in condi
tion. The long rest he has had has done
him much good. His hands are In perfect
shape and his arm has lost none of its
strength. Dal intends to show his numer
ous friends how much he has improved
since his memorable battle with Frank
Erne. He expresses confidence in being
able to defeat McFadden. Hawkins says
he likes a rushJng fight, as it gives him
a chance to whip In some of his terrific
blows.
McFadden is training at Croll's Gar
dens, Alameda. He Is out on the road
every day and does a great deal of gym
nasium work. , 2
Manager Gleason of the club last night

Following are the entries, for the $2500

Tclamon, Canmore. Articulate, Janice,
Beau Ormond, Silurian and Argregor. '
of close finishes, a few favorites
getting the money and a decision by the
judges which provoked the .shouters
around the stand to vent their feelings
in sojne well-delivered groans and hisses.
What brought it all about was this:
Henry on Lucien Appleby and O'Con
nor on Legal Maxim had the race
between themselves from the pad
dock. Legal Maxim was slightly in
the lead, both riders whipping and
driving hard. "When the wire was
reached all spectators on the angle were
convinced that Legal Maxim had won.
varying the distance from an exaggerated
Hibernian nose to a full length. Somf
placed nt the wire thought it was a dead
heat, some that Appieby finished a neck
in advance of Legal Maxim and others
that Logal Maxim hrul won out for a cer
tainty. When the ultimate judgment was
expressed for Lucien Appleby the judges
were roundly hissed. At the best the
race vas very close and needed a dis
criminating eye to detect or decipher the
winner.
The day opened well and for the first
time in fifteen races the real favorite
found Its way under the wire ahead of
the bunch. Racetto. with O'Connor up,
passed In three lengths in the lead of
Antagone, with Burns doing the piloting.
It was the splendid riding of O'Connor
that won the race for Racetto, who was
brought up from behind Just at the proper
time.
The third race, over six furlongs for
three-year-olds, was won by Impromptu,
Henry up. When the stretch was reached
Impromptu took the\lead and the others
tacked on, Darlene getting the place and
Sebastiana the show.
Henry rode a pretty race on Vulcain in
the one mile four-ye&r-old affair. Astor
led from the start, running away from the
field until the stretch was reached, when
Vulcain came up like a shot out of a
cannon. Astor was. headed at the wire
and that was all.
Handicapper made all the others look
like feather-weights in the six furlongs
for three-year-olds, the fifth event on the
card. Seide, with J. Walsh up, and An
drattus came In fcr Â¦ place and show
money.
Lamachus and Bogus Bill fought It out
at the stretch In the last race over a
mile and seventy yards of the slimy slush.
Bogus Bill ran to win. but just before
the wire he was headed by Lamachus In
a driving finish.

THE monotony of uneventful long
shots on a slushy, sloppy, knee
deep muddy track was broken
yesterday at Tanforan by a serie3
AT TANFORAN TRACK
By F. E. MAilholland.
p^-j INHERE was no stopping the favor-
II ltos at Oakland track yesterday
I and the form player with his
) 1 "dope" book put a. well-defined
crimp in the ring. After The
Benedict, a 9 to 5 choice, was retired
by Peace, the next in demand in the
opening event. " favorites ran the string
out. quite an unusual occurence over a
muddy track. Alsura, Victoria S, * Sea
Lion, Lennep ind Horton were the horses
that made life a burden to the layers of
odds. The a'ttendance was up to *he
average and the betting brisk enough to
keep the ticket and sheet writers busy.
It was reported around in Inner circles
that "Doc" Street's Faverdale gelding.
The Benedict, had been burning up the
track in his morning workouts, and as
Dominick had the mount, the books took
the hunch and made the horse favorite.
Unfortunately for his backers. Jay
Ransch broke away in the lead wltn
Pea^e and despite the hard riding of
Dominick. Fred Foster's fretful mare
won by half a length. After running in
third position for a long way and looKing
a certainly for a piece of the money,
Haserdon lost the show to La Mascotta.
Nash Turner at last broke his long spell
of ill luck by landing the live and a half
furlong dash that followed with Alzura,
from Torn Ryan's stable. The rllly was
played down to 4 to 5 favoritism and, lead
ing throughout, beat El Sonora three
lengths. Bavaspa with Bullman in the
saddle came in for considerable support
at short odds, but sulked almost from
the start.
Felix Carr's filly Victoria S earned her
second pair of brackets in the "baby"
race. A 7 to 10 favorite Bullrnan quickly
shook off the rield and with several
pounds up her sleeve, the Daughter of
Service led out Innocencia a couple of
lengths. The latter miss was once 30 to
1 in the betting and will take some beat-
Ing next time sho starts In moderate com
rany. Mike Murphy of the noted turf
family of Murphys finished third. On all
past mud form, nobody dreamt of Mont
allade being a contender in the seven fur
long soiling affair, and when he brought
the favorite Sea TJon with Bullman up
to a desperate drive, much surprise was
expressed. As Holtman dropped his flag
Dominick rushed Montallade off in the
lead and for a time it looked as if the
Hrst choice would not get up. From the
paddock in, the outsider became attacked
with the tired feeling and Sea Lion scored
by a length. Ransch made botchy work
of it on Dunfree, losing the show to
Grand Sachem. Â¦
Rut for the excellent handling she re
ceived. Lennep would have been beaten
for the mile selling run by Scotch Plaid.
Fred Foster's mare had up 112 pounds,
and plainly demonstrated that weight
packing is not her forte. Dominick on
the choice took the lead after passing the
half and Into the strt-tch looked an easy
winner. Approaching the wire Scotch
Plaid gradually crawled up on the leader
and in a hard drive only lost the decision
by a neck. Stuart did everything but fall
off Bathos, ending up a very bad third.
For a time during the progress of the
final mile and a sixteenth selling run. the
bookmakers were jubilant. Howell astride
the favorite Horton lay so far out of it
that it seemed an utter Impossibility that
the little red horse could make it. and
El Mido was put down as the winner.
Three furlongs from the stand Howell
called on Horton. and In a furlong made
up a dozen lengths. From the eighth pole
in. Horton had control of things, winning
from El Mido as he liked. Hard ridden,
Essence ran third.

the canine for any sum, so Mr. Ramsdell
tried another tack. He appealed to Ca

Two more suits were instituted In the
Superior Court yesterday by Allen I R.
Partridge against Frank W. Page, Mrs.
Lillian Page, George W. Baker, the Vul
can Smelting Company and others. In
one complaint Partridge seeks, to cancel
certificates to 58,353 shares of the Vulcan
Smelting Company, which he alleges were
illegally issued by the defendant direc
tors of the corporation named to various
parties among whom are M. J. Burke. E.
B. Preston, J. D. Hurd and Luther Bur
bank.
Partridge alleges that the stock, which
he claims has no legal existence in law
or fact, was sold by the defendants In the
open market. He also claims that George
"\V. Baker caused a certificate of 5C0J
shares to be made out- in his name,
though no legal authority for the issuance
of the' certificate existed.
In the second suit, which Is practically
an amendment of one heretofore filed, he
claims Page and others defrauded him
out of valuable interests in certain pa
tents. â¢ He asks that the assignment by
him of such interest be set aside and the
right and possession of the same be vest
ed in him by the court.

The ancient and honorable absurdity
kno-a-n to the -world as "carrying coals
to Newcastle" has held its own these many
decades, but there is a new one which,
while not as absurd, appears to be fully
as exceptional. A week ago the proposi
tion that in time the French vigneron
would look to the transplant?- French
vines in California for. cuttings where
with to restore to France the pristine
glory of Its wines would have been con
sidered nonsensical. However, this strange
plan has been recently considered and
adopted by one of the titled and wealthy
French wine producers.
The peculiar experiment Is due to the
splendid showing made by California
wines at tho Paris Exposition of last
year. A short time ago a prominent
banker of this city received from a world
famous wine grower of Paris a letter In
whl^h he refer.-ed to what had been ac
complished in the production in California
of high class wines from vines the orig
inals of which had been Imported from
I^a. Belle. France. He further stated he
was convinced that by reason of tho
fenlality of the soil and climate of this
tate the vines "had beon resuscitated
and rejuvenated" and were possessed of
the many virtues of the mother vines
prior to their degeneration and final de
struction by phylloxera. In consequence
of this belief this French expert ordered
the banker to send him forthwith live
thousand cuttings from the mother vines
with which to test his theory.
The order was turned over to a promi
nent vlneyardist of Llvermore Valley. The
wishes of the enterprising Frenchman
were observed with the utmost care, and
the five thousand cuttings were selected
from the best varieties of vines that had
been brought from France. The delicate
twigfs were encased and sealed in airtight
paraffined paper bass, then packed in
moist sawdust and shipped to Paris by
fast express. . Tho shipment Is already on
the way. and in accordance with an
agreement the California vlneyardlsts will
In time be informed of the result of the
novel effort at rejuvenation of French
vineyards from stocks of the Golden
State.
. The oddity of the scheme will be better
understood when it Is known that hun
dreds of thousands of acres of vineyards
in France were destroyed through the In
troduction of vines from California that
Â¦were Infected with phylloxera. Who will
pav after this that California has not
achieved exalted greatness as the homo
of the vine and good wine?

If Shay's story . is true, it Is probable
that Flint, riding close behind him on the
steep hillside, was thrown off through his
horse stumbling- and struck Shay as he
pitched downward, knocking him off his
steed.
This was told by Shay a-fter he had
fully regained his senses and is the only
evidence the officers have. They have not
been able to discover the existence of any
feeling of emnity between the men and
are at a loss to account for the myste
rious affair.
The sergreant who had charge of the re-.
Uef party, and who found the body of
Flint, said he relieved the men at 7 o'clock
and they started for quarters. He 'saw
them ta'-ie the road known as the "cut
off" and did not see them again until he
Instituted a search after seeing the horses
gallop Into the stables.
Members of tho troop to which Flint
and Shay belong say the men were al
ways good friends, and the officers state
that both were good soldiers.
The only theorv advanced in . explana
tion of the mysterious affair other than
that of murder Is that the two men, who
were perpetually boasting of the relative
merits of their horses, started a race
through the wood?, during which they
were either knocked from their horses
simultaneously or were thrown through
both horsf-s famine at once.
\VhÂ«Â»n found Flint's head was almost
buried in. the sand, trees on one side of
the path were slightly barked and his
hlotine was torn In several places. His
revolver was found fully loaded In the
holster and no other weapon was In evi
dei.-.e.
Shay's revolver was also in perfect
shape and In Its usual place.
The autopsy performed by the surgeons
showed that the Boldier's death was
caused by a fractured skull, which might
havo been caused by contact with the
limb of a tree or a horse's hoof.
The wound over Shay's eye is only of
the flesh, but is very long. He made sev
eral Incoherent statements while his
wound was being dressed, but there was
nothing tangible in what he said, except
ing that he and Flint were ridlnp very
fast. He was taken from the honpltal to
the Biiar-dhouse, where he will be con
fined until evidence is Eecured to show
he had no knowledge of his comrade's
death.
Later In the day Shay requested an in
terview with Colonel Rawles and told
that officer the following story:
"Flint and I were riding pretty fast
through the woods. I was In the lead,
and suddenly I felt something: strike me
in the forehead. I know nothing of what
then happened and was In ignorance of
poor Flint's death until I was asked about
him. We were good frJends and only this
morning had been planning a trip to town
together.
Shay shed many tears while telling his
story and asked permission to view the
remains of his comrade.
Numerous stories were by this time
afloat, the possibility of a murder having
been done being the most prominent.
Shay was In such a condition that he
could elve no explanation of the affair,
and after having his wounds dressed at
the Post Hospital was placed In confine
ment, awaiting an investigation.
Continuing his search, the sergeant
found the lifeless body of Flint lying In
the sand, with numerous wounds about
the head.
Fifteen minutes after relieving Privates
Frank R. Flint and Joseph Shay of the
Sixth Cavalry from sentry duty at 7
o'clock yesterday morning Patrol Ser
geant Schonthaler found the horses ridden
by the men galloping toward the troop
stable riderless, and upon Instituting a
search found Shay emerging from the
woods with a deep wound over the eye
and In a dazed condition.

could be constructed at a minimum cost
and that when In operation should be a
good payinsr Investment.
Engineers will be shortly sent out to
survey a route for the road, which will be
of standard gnugo. Tho corporation will
be capitalized at J3.000.000. .
King stated yesterday that with this
new road built the long stage line routes
that are now in operation in Lake County
would be minimized. The stage ride to
Bcrtlett Springs would be reduced to fif
teen miles, landing passengers at that
resort six hours earlier than the trip can
new be accomplished. Highland Springs
will be reached with an eight-mile drive
Instead of the present twenty-one-mlle
drive. " Adams Springs will be only four
miles from the railroad station.
The company when formed will be
known as tho San Francisco and Clear
Lake Railroad Company. The road. start-
Ing from Vallejo, will pass through the
Napa Valley, Sage Canyon and Pope Val
ley. At the terminus of the road on
Clear Lake a line of lake steamers will Be
established. These boats will touch at
Bartlett Landing, Lakeport and Boda Bay.
A project Is on foot In this

"Its equal does not exist." he declared.
"Artistic design, faultiess execution, flaw
less material, indeed fitness in the broad
est sense of the term, mark this mag
nificent gift from a citizen to the city of
his adoption. The value of the gift is
enhanced, more really than apparently,
by an artistic opulence that will be more
thoroughly appreciated In years to come
than It is to-day. When foreign con
noisseurs, fresh from the art centers of
the old world and the great authorities
on park ornamentation shall have given
the stand the seal of European approval
our people will learn, the value of their
peerless prize."

forts being made at Sacramento to pro
vide for legislative control of the affairs
of this city. Horace Davis paid a com
pliment to the Merchants' Association and
said that Its work was far more -lasting
than the street improvements In which it
had been concerned, for it was teaching
the young the lesson of self-sacrifice for
the public good and civic duty. In
cidentally he said that he had been asked
who was the foremost citizen of San
Francisco and that he had promptly an
swered F. W. Dohrmann.

INFORMATION WANTED.
IZq ROM the State Board of Trade comes the cu
| rious report that applications from Eastern
home-seekers for information concerning various
counties in the State have frequently to be inade
quately answered by reason of the lack of county pub
lications giving the desired facts. It appears that
many counties have not supplied the board with de
scriptive pamphlets or circulars for distribution, and
consequently the home-seeker who desires to learn
something about a county before making a journey to
it is forced to turn his attention to some other section.
The fact is somewhat singular. If there be any peo
ple in the world who ought to know the value of ad
vertising it is the people of California. This State is
rcmo'te from the center of American population. It is
in climate, soil and resources distinct. from other sec
tions of the Union. It has advantages which are not
to be found elsewhere, and of which the majority of
Eastern people are wholly ignorant. Therefore to
attract settlers and capitalists seeking investments for
their money it is necessary there should be an exten
sive advertising of the resources of every section of
the State, for in no other way can the variety of re
sources and advantages be made known.
In no other respect is California more distinct from
the East than in the wide differences that exist be
tween the soil, the climate and the general conditions
of localities that are geographically near one another.
On the other side the mountains a whole State is
known as a wheat State, a corn State, a cotton State.
a fruit-growing State or a grazing State. In one the
climate is cold; in another it is warm. No such con
ditions prevail here. Within the confines of Cali
fornia one county is often radically distinct from the
county adjoining it, so that no home-seeker can profit
much by what is known as "general information."
He' must study each county separately. If he fail to
do so he may make a mistake that will cost him
dear by locating in a county where a particular in
dustry he desires to undertake may prove far less
profitable than it would be in an adjoining county.
During the, boom years that preceded the financial
panic, the industrial depression and the long drought,
there was an. abundance of literature descriptive of
California counties.. Some of the pamphlets issujed
ar that time were among the best compendiums of in
formation that could be devised. They were attractive
and interesting as well as instructive, and their cir
culation had a beneficial effect upon the whole State.
Such pamphlets should be again prepared and circu
lated. There is no county in California so well known
as' not to need further advertising, nor any so back
ward as not to be able to afford the cost of publish
ing descriptive circulars.
The railroad has offered inducements for home
seekers to visit the State. The increase of wealth
during the recent prosperous years will enable many
families to take advantage of the opportunity afforded
by the roads. Consequently, we are, likely to have
during the. whole of this year a considerable number
of persons seeking homes in Californfa. or places in
which to invest money, and the counties should be
prompt'in providing all information "the visitors may

ANTI-IRRIGATION FIGURES.
DURING the debate in the House on a bill ap
propriating the sum of $100,000 for the purpose
of investigating the water resources of the arid
districts of the country the whole subject of irriga
tion came under discussion. The salient points of the
speeches made by the men who opposed the bill are
worth noting as illustrations of the arguments which
the West will have to meet in carrying on the cam
paign of education in favor of the great enterprise.
The first of the arguments against the measure was
based upon- estimates of the probable- cost. Hill of
Connecticut in opposing the bill said that the irriga
tion of our arid lands would cost in the aggregate
$36,000,000,000, Mr. Cannon, chairman of the Com
mittee on Appropriations, said the' enterprise would
in the end cost the treasury upward of $750,000,000.
When such estimates are placed side by side their
worthlessness is at once apparent. Between $750,000.
000 and $36,000,000,000 there is an immense gap. It is
clear the men who used such arguments have never
made an estimate of the cost. They have hardly given
the subject a moment of serious thought. Had they
done so their estimates of the cost- would have been
at least within gunshot of one another.
Such an argument is valuable only because it shows
the temper with which many influential Eastern men
approach the subject of irrigation. They are so an
tagonistic to it 'they will not reason about it. They
content themselves with assertions having no valid
ity, and are evidently relying upon the prejudices and
the ignorance of the Eastern people to support them
in their opposition.
Should any refutation be required for such ex
travagant misstatements it can be found in the care
ful estimates made by experts who have studied the
subject. At the Irrigation Congress held at Chicago
last fall the estimates of experts were that there are
from 75,000,000 to 100,000,000 acres of land in the
arid regions that can be irrigated at a cost not too
great to make the enterprise profitable. Captain
Hiram Chittenden of the engineer corps that made a
survey of the region m 1897 and who is regarded as
the highest authority on the subject taken as a whole
reported to the congress that a complete system of.
reservoirs could be constructed for $143,000,000. The
highest estimate made by any competent authority is
that the average cost of irrigation would not exceed
$2 an acre. According to these estimates the total
sum required for irrigation of all the arid lands that
can be profitably irrigated would not exceed $200,000,
000. That sum, moreover, would be expended during
a long series of years, and the sale of the lands as
they were brought under irrigation would furnish the
Government with funds to carry on the work, so
that the direct cost upon the East would be small.
The second objection made to the enterprise is that
I the irrigation of the arid regions should be carried
on by States and Territories and not by the National
Government. Here, again, the objectors disclose
their ignorance of the problem. Some of the streams
from which water for irrigation will have to be ob
tained traverse two or more States, and there are
other complications that make separate State action
unadvisable. The enterprise, in fact, is national and
should be treated as. such, j
From the statements made it will be seen we have
a long task ahead of us in educating Congress on this
subject. Fortunately a good deal has been already
done. There are net 'many men who believe that ir-
Eastern poets, moved to verse by the munificent
gifts of Andrew Carnegie, are said to be in despair
because they cannot find a rhyme for his name. The
Springfield Republican â¢ says the only rhyme is
"plaguey." Evidently such a rhyme is of no use; but
how would it do for the poets to have a little rhyme
about "pulling his leggy"?
A recent explanation of the British Ministry con
cerning the purchase of steel bridges for the Uganda
railroad from American instead of British firms
brought out the fact that an American contractor of
fered to have the bridges ready for use in three
months' less time than any British bidder offered to
have the material ready for shipment from England.
It goes without saying the explanation was sufficient
to justify the Government, for at this juncture the
British have no time 10 waste in any part of Africa.

MORE BUTCHERY.
WHILE negotiations for peace, indemnity and
atonement were in progress between the For
eign Ministers t.rA China Von Waidersee wan
tcr.ly and without cause was sending out slaughter
parties to turn North China into a shambles. All
American authorities except the more bloodthirsty
of the missionaries, agree that there was no provoca
tion nor excuse for the butchery and robbery that the
German field marshal caused. Peaceful cities, filled
with friendly people, v.ere looted and burned, and
crimes were committed that will make the name of
Christian civilization a nauseating stench in the East.
With unusual patience and submissiveness China
wcr.t on in her endeavor to restore order and care for
her people, famine smitten by the overrunning of
their fields, at the same time being harried by the
butchers of Von Waidersee.
Now, while the allies are in negotiation and the
world is hoping for an end of the tragedy, it is re
ported that Von Waidersee has ordered another
great military movement, to penetrate as far as pos
sible into Western China. It is known that China has
no organized army, and in this crisis is incapable of
protecting her cities and her people. They are at the
mercy of the allies, an i the quality of that mercy may
he judged by the harrowing reports that have come
from Japanese, American and English sources of the
unprintable atrocities that were perpetrated in No
vember and December by the force under Von Wai
dersee. Cities that welcomed and fed his troops
were looted and put to the torch. We desire to im
press the facts of that distant situation upon our
readers. The code of - .var forbids the sacking of an
undefended city and the robbery and slaughter of a
non-resisting population. The career of Genghir
Khan has been used to picture the horrors- of which
Pagandom was capable and to point the contrast with
Christendom. But Gengbiz never sacked an unde
fended city. When he was at peace with the empire
of M'jhammed Shah the Governor of Otrar killed a
party of his commercial traders. Genghiz demanded
that the Governor be delivered to him for punish
ment. Instead of complying with this demand M'i
liammed beheaded one of the envoys who brought it
and sent the others back without their beards. Then
came tn-ar, and the great Khan marched on Bok
hara, "the noble city." After its defense by 400,000
soldiers failed he entered it and, mounting the steps
of the mosque, cried out to his troops, "The hay is
cut; give your horse* fodder."
History says: "They needed no second invitation
to plunder. The city was sacked and the inhabitants
cither escaped beyond the walls or were compelled
to submit to infamies worse than death. As a final
act of vengeance the town was fired."
But that was about the year 1220, nearly seven hun
dred years ago, and the looter of Bokhara was the
son of a Mongol raider born to battle with a clot
cf blood in his clenched hand. And the city resisted.
A vast army, as well equipped as his, opposed his ad
vance, and, after all, he did no worse than Von Wal
dersee and his allies at Paotingfu. and a dozen other
Chinese cities that were not defended, made no re
sistance and freely offered food and shelter to then
Christian destroyers.
Now the German commander in chief of the allies
proposes a renewal cf this military infamy. There is
nothing in the situation that requires a single soldier
to leave camp. There :s not an armed force in all the
region he intends to raid. There is not a city capable
of resistance, not a man nor woman in all that zone
able to defend propert3 r or honor.
Does the so-called civilised world comprehend the
situation? This new expedition is not to protect
nnj-body. It is not to punish any new anti-foreign
outbreak. It is not to effect any good purpose in
politics. It is simply for murder and lobbery, and
worcjc The American people are gratified that our
troops under General Chaffee are not to take part in
this cowardly and ignoble movement They a:e
pleased that our flag is not to be carried in the t'ain
of robbers and murderers whose crimes by contrast
lave made the excesses of the Boxers look like the
innocent games of a country Sunday-school.
\Ve are glad that the religious press of this coun
try is awakening to its duty. The Central Christian
Advocate, organ of the Methodist church, admits that
"even the Boxers themselves have been outdone bv
the lust, the outrages and rapine of the foreign sol
diers," and quotes an eye-witness in Peking to the
effect that "for a century to come Chinese converts
will consider robbery and vengeance* to be Christian
virtues." , â¢ . ; ..
APPALACHIAN FOREST RESERVE.
ONE of the most important forestry enterprises
contemplated by the Government is that of
establishing a great reserve in what is known
as the Appalachian belt. The bill now before Con
gress provides that the Secretary of Agriculture shall
purchase not more than 2,000,000 acres of forest in
the States of Virginia, West Virginia, North and
South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia.
The object is to place in "the hands of the Govern
ment a forest covering the watersheds of the moun
tains, out of which flow so many important streams
in the States named. It is generally understood,
however, that if the measure be adopted the main
reserve will be in the mountains of North Carolina,
which are the highest on this continent east of the
Rockies. Â¦ .
While the plan is being urged mainly by members
of Congress from the various States whose streams
would be affected by the preservation of the forest
area, it has had considerable support in the North.
It is recognized that such a reserve would afford the
Eastern side of the country a great national park
similar to Yellowstone Park. The North Carolina
mountains abound in beautiful scenery and are among
the healthiest localities in the world. They are now
so well traversed by railroads that it is said the pro
posed park would be accessible to people from as
far east as Boston, as"far'west as St. Paul and as far
south as New Orleans within twenty-four hours.
In addition to the double good of protecting the
water supply and providing a spacious pleasure
ground the great park would also serve as a means
of preserving an extensive area of hardwood forests.
It would thus serve as- a great school of forestry,
teaching by object lessons on the grandest scale, and
in that way would have a beneficial effect upon the
country at large.
Under our system of government the greater part
of the work of forest protection and promotion must,
be performed by the States. Nevertheless, the Fed
eral Government can do much in preparing the way
and demonstrating how the work should be done.
That guidance, moreover, ought to be promptly
given/- We have reached the stage in our develop
ment where forest protection will have to be under
taken on scientific principles and on a comprehensive
scale, or else the penalty will be heavy.
. Fortunately for California the nation has here pre
served extensive ranges of park. It now behooves
ths'State to follow up the good work and do some
thing for itself. The plan proposed by the Scmper
virens Club, for the preservation of the redwoods of
the Big Basin, is one that might well be taken up at
this session of the Legislature. . No such forest as
that can be found elsewhere on the globe, and its
preservation would provide near the center of popu
lation on this coast a holiday ground more wonderful
even than that which the East hopes to see estab
lished among the heights of the Great Smoky Range
in North Carolina. '
The Atlanta Constitution reports that the Bryan
Birthday Club of Chattanooga; Tenn., which it says
was organized "to celebrate annually the birthday of
the greatest Democrat since Jefferson," has re
cently had a row among its members, and accord
ingly there will be no banquet this year. The greatest
since Jefferson will have to celebrate alone.
PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.

The San Francisco Call
Proper Food, Shelter and Dress.
Yet freedom from worry alone will not
prove in itself to be the elixir of youth.
With it a careful regard for our physical
and mental well-being in every respect is
indispensable. Proper food, shelter ana
raiment must be provided, and with re
spect to all these due regard must be had
for the teachings of science as gathered
from long experience. ,
Food must be adapted to our constitu
tional peculiaritiesâ best of all, under
medical adviceâ and in drink every sacri
fice should be made In order to obtain that
rarest of all fluids, the purest kind of
water- â
We should seek our shelter in well-ven
tilated dwellings in healthful locations,
and these considerations should outweigh
tho dictates of either fashion or conveni
ence. - Â«
In raiment also we should be Independ
ent enough to follow the promptings of
common sense and not torture our bodies
into disease by the straltjacket of tight
lacing, pinching shoes, heavy headgear
and all the other monstrosities of our so
called modern civilization.
To these must be added, as of almost
equal importance, the necessity of allow
ing nature, rather than expediency, to
prescribe the hours of sleep and rest; and
under rest I include every kind of proper
recreation and diversion. And, on the
other hand again, exercises, both physical
and mental, which react upon each other,
must not be omitted from our pro
gramme. As health of body is essential
to prolonged, severe, successful mental ef
fort, so, also, and even more, in my opin
ion, there cannot be permanent perfect
physical health without the exercise of
our mental faculties. The farmer, with
the sinews of Iron, but mental sloth, as a
rule dies younger than the professional
man with constant brain activity.
Keep Clean, but Avoid Extremes-
Careful bathing and ablutions and pure
air must also receive attention, yet in
nothing are people more apt to run to ab
surd extremes than in these. The mania
for "hardening" ourselves by plunging
into ice-cold or boiling tubs of water or
subjecting ourselves to the onslaughts of
the wintry blasts or burning currents of
our eccentric Climate without regard to
our physical condition for the time being
is as illogical as it is pernicious. Clean
liness and fresh air, in ,the sense of these
extremities, kill more people than what
they would probably call reprehensible ab
stention from either.
Moderation in these things, as well as In
, everything that may be carried . to ex
tremes, should be our watchword if we
desire to prolong life at the same time
that we preserve our health. There may
be as much intemperance in exercise, the
! use of food and water and every essential
of existence as In the indulgence In stimu
lants or tobacco. There is nothing won
derful, therefore, in the examples so- often
cited that this individual or that has lived
to an extreme old a^e. although he daily
took his dram or tobacco or did this thing
or that which, in the eyes of the extrem
ists, is believed to be sure to kill. "In
: medlo tutlsslmus ibis" I would emblazon
as the motto at the very commencement
of my programmeâ "The middle course is
the safest."
Intelligent Study of Health Condi
tions.
Recently a society was Btarted In the
city of New York to study and discuss
the problems and conditions conducive to
longevity. If experience has taught that in
individual cases mere fortuitous circum
stances and observances have led to an
exceptional prolongation of life, why I
should not statistical observation In nu- !
merous cases eventually evolve principles
on which the expectation of longer life
than the traditional three score years and
ten or four score years may be predi
cated?
Such a society, in order to be success
ful, should have for its nucleus a member
ship of serious professional and scientific
men, who would be able to pursue their
investigations and discuss and compare
their results intelligently. Fads, foibles
and the cranks and dreamers who possess
them should be rigidly excluded from such
an organization or it Is* bound to be a
failure. The trouble with nearly all move
ments heretofore in that direction has
been that they have fallen into the hands
of quacks and dilettani. who Imagine that
they can discover some panacea for the
indefinite prolongation of life merely by
talking about it, without the slightest re
gard for the teachings of science or ex
perience. The problems Involved In this
question are of the most serious nature
and require the profoundest study and
consideration.-
Old Age Is Opportunity.
Undoubtedly the world has progressed,
not only in ameliorating the condition, but
in prolonging the period of what In the
ordinary acceptance of the term Is called
old age, and I have no doubt that the time
will come when the majority of men will
be at their best at 70, instead of, as Is now
so often the case, at their worst at 40;
when men and women will be not only as
old as they feel but as they look, and will
both feel and look as they should at every
period of life, even at five score or more*
when youth will not arrogate to itself the
sole right of existence, and when old age
will believe that
"Age is opportunity no less
Than youth Itself, though in another dress.
And as the evening twilight fades away.
The sky Is filled with stars. Invisible by day."

And a similar strain of sadness'and de

of all times and the minds of all men,
glorifying youth and bewailing the ad
vent of old age. So universal is this senti
ment that praise of old age would almost
seem to require, by way of preface, an
apology. If such werp needed I would
present It in the masterful essay on old

Ralph Waldo Emerson. How true his

muscular strength, organic instincts, gross

the central wisdom, which was old age
In Infancy, is young In four score years,
and, dropping off obstructions, leaves In
happy subjects a mind purified and wise.
People Are Only as Old as They Feel.
The attainment of this wisdom should
be the aim and object, and when attained
at the same time, the glory of declining
years. Nothing is more despicable than
an old person parading in the garb or
youth and. substituting wig and cosmetics
for the curls and bloom of early days.
While nqt admitting that a woman Is as
old as she looks, I firmly believe that both
men and women are only as old as they
feel. As there may be an old head on
young shoulders, so also there may be,
and should be always, a young heart un
der old shoulders. Xot years but disposi

Contrast with this what Dr. Deems,
pastor of the Church of the Strangers In

Examples Taken From the Eecent
Past.
There recently died in the city of New
York within a few days of each other
four prominent men engaged in different
pursuits and past the meridian of life,
all well known to meâ Judge J. H. Beek
man, one of the brightest and most in
dustrious members of the Supreme Court
bench of this city, aged C6; Charles C.
Beaman, a profound and brilliant law
yer, partner of Joseph M. Choate, aged
61; Oswald Ottendorfer, journalist, editor
of the greatest German newspaper in the
country ' and multi-millionaire, aged "5;
Hugo Wesendonck, prominent In business
circles, founder and president of the Ger
mania Life Insurance Company, at the
age of 84.
Of these men I -would designate Judge
Beekman as the most learned; Mr. Bea
man as the happiest, owing to his de
lightful associations and the enjoyment
of his leisure hours; Mr. Ottendorfer.
while the poorest In health, yet the most
successful, as he combined with vast
wealth great power and high honor, and
Mr. Wesendonck as the best In health
and of the most cheerful disposition.
Each one of these men was a brain
worker In the best sense of that word;
each had attained a position af affluence
which saved him from the petty annoy
ance and worry of struggling for a dally
existence; each had achieved the greatest
success In his respective calling, and
none of them appear to have been
the victim of any dire organic disease of
heredity. While, therefore, they were so
nearly on a par in the elements which
are generally supposed to tend more es
pecially to the prolongation of life, yet.
from my personal knowledge of them. I
would say that in fact the youngest of
them In years was the oldest, and the
oldest in years the youngest.
Judge Beekman. while a most pleasant
companion. Impressed me as the most In

ties, yet always appeared to be in the
most delightful mood, and In the full en

with tho youth of the octogenarian and
the age of the man just past 50. At what
period, then, with these men did old age
âold ace in the popular acceptation of
that termâ begin? Surely not with years.
At What Age Do People Become OldP
This leads me to the question, When
may a man or woman in general be con
sidered old? What Is the line of demarca
tion between middle and declining life?
Many writers have contended that this
occurs at about the age of 63, yet in the
examples which I have above given this
certainly does not hold true. Fixed lim
its in fact, both as to the commencement
of old age and as to the natural dura
tion of life itself (numerous writers fix it
at five times the period of growth. 18 to
21 or at 00 to 105 years), are. in my optn
years doea not as a. rule Indicate old age:
ion, purely theoretical, because fullness of
years does not as a rule indicate old age;
nor, on the other hand, does a life of few
er years necessarily demonstrate prema
ture demise. â¢ Â¦-
â¢ That is not to say, however, that a lire
long In years may not also be a long life
without the inroads *of the Infirmities and
annoyances* of old age, and that is the
goal which the advocates of longevity
seek to attainâ not a long life of .misery
and disease/but a long life of health and
happiness.
The Destructiveness of "Worry.
What can be done to prolong life in the

RUSSIAN SUGAR.
THE policy of the Dingley bill being to protect
domestic sugar lefining, by giving a differential
duty on refined sugar to offset the cost of re
fining, it became necessary to extend this method
to the bounty-paid beet sugar of Europe by adding to
the differential an amount equal to the bounty. This
countervailing duty was put at once upon the German
sugar, and has* now been added to the normal dif
ferential on the beet sugar of Southern Russia.
To comprehend the situation as a protective meas
ure it is only necessary to realize that the bounty
paid by the Governments of the beet sugar countries
reduces the cost of lefining to such an extent that
bountied sugar can enter this country in spite of the
normal differential. The effect of bountied sugar is
shown in England. That country does no sugar re
fining at all, but takes the bountied sugar of the Con
tinent. Although England has cane sugar lands in
abundance in her tropical colonies, her free trade pol
icy, acted upon by the sugar bounty of the Continent,
has obsoletcd her production of raw and refined
sugar.
Under the protection policy of this country the
sugar issue is exactly the same as all the other issues
involved.
The law is not made by the Secretary of the Treas
ury, but, as he has justly observed, is committed to
him for enforcement. When he ordered the counter
vailing duty put on Russian sugar the importer had
his recourse in a protest which finally reaches the
General Appraisers, 2nd from them an appeal lies 10
the Circuit Court. Until this recourse has been ex
hausted, and the process is not long, it may not be
said that Russian sug3r is excluded. If the importers
do not protest at all, it is their admission that the
Secretary has only enforced the law, and the only
further appeal is to Congress.
It is said that Russia has already retaliated by im
posing maximum duties on American machinery and
metal products.
This will affect our exports, especially to Siberia,
where American mining machinery is in demand. But
Russian commercial interests confess that American
manufactures are the cheapest and best, and to ex
clude them compels a resort to products that cost
more and are of less excellence.
European discomfort under the rapid extension of
our trade and in the face of our capacity to protect
it has shown another symptom in Austria, where our
pork products arc about to be shut out in the interest
of the home p/oducer, although his pork is neither
as cheap nor as good.
It must not be forgotten that European Govern
ments which pursue this policy of exclusion have
finally to reckon with their own consumers. These
have had a chance at American products, have found
them cheaper and better than others, and will not
long patiently pay more for inferior articles.
Germany and England expect benefit to their ex
port trade from the action of Russia. But unless they
economize production and improve the quality of
their product they will not long enjoy any benefit
from a mere!}' artificial event in commerce.

and rubble ballast. On November 2S she
sailed for Portland, but before the offlng
could be made the wind fell light and tho
Edmund began to drift. It was pitch
dark and Captain Gerdau thought his ves
sel was still well offshore when she
grounded on the beach broadside on in
side of Agenda Rock. Every effort was
mrde to get the vessel off and the cap
tain crossed the Gulf of California to
Guaymas and telegraphed to San Fran
cisco for assistance. Captain Metcalfo
went down overland and Captain McCoy
took the Luckenbach down.
When the Luckenbach reached the scene
Captain Gerdau had struck all his top
masts and gangs of natives were taking
ballast out of the vessel. As soon as that
work was accomplished a diver, who went
down on the I>uckenbach, was sent down
and he patched up the big holes in the
ship's sides, after which she was pumped
out. The wreckers went to work on the
big ship on December 22 and on January 36
she was afloat. There were dozens of
small leaks where rivets had sprung and
these had to be stopped, so it was Feb
ruary 2 before a start could be made for
S.in Diego. On arriving at the latter
place there was four feet of water' In the
hold and that had to be pumped out and
the ship patched up again. â¢
The run from Satt Diego to San Fran
cisco was made in fifty-five hours, but as
it was dark and blowing a gale. Captain
McCoy decided to remain out all night.
Captain McCoy has a very poor idea of
the Mexican way of doing business. The
Luckenbach lay about two ship's lengths
from the wharf and the tup had to make
elsrht or nine trips between the ship an<l
the Ehcre. Every time a permit to dock
had to be procured. This cost a dollar
and s. pilot always brought it out. His
fee for docking the tug was 54. When
Captain McCoy wanted to go out to the
stranded ship again he had to get another
permit and pay another $1. Then tho
p:lot would take the tug out again and
collect another $4. In this way the Mex
icans collected about ?100 from the Luck
enbach In pilotage and permits alone.
The Edmund will bo surveyed to-day
and will go on the drydock next week.
POETLAND'S DECK CAVES IN.
Additional Difficulty Must Be Over-
come Before Sunken Steamer
Can Be Raissd.
The forward deck of thÂ© half sunken
steamer South Portland caved in Tuesday
night and now everybody Is in a quandary
as to Just how the steamer will be raised.
Some weeks ago the steamer's cargo of
lime caught fire and Ehe was scuttled in
order to save the hull. In the attempt to
raise her a caisson was built around the
forward hatch and three Immense pumps
set to work to clear the hold of water.
Just when the vessel began to give signs
of coming up there was a crash and the
deck and pumps went down Into the hold.
The chances are that an attempt will bo
mf.de to raise tho steamer by means of
pontoons to-day.

p s "yp^HE German four-masted bark Ed-
I mund. that went ashore at Santa
I Rosalia last Xovember, was towed
1L into port by the Spreckels tug
Luckenbach yesterday. Captain
John Metcalfe. Lloyd's surveyor, superin
tended the work of getting the vessel off
and Captain McCoy of tho Luckenbach
gives him all the credit.
"It was a very clever piece of work,"
said Captain McCoy yesterday, "and Cap
tain Metcalfe deserves all the praise. He
gave the orders and I carried them out to
the be3t of my ability."
In return Captain Metcalfe lias nothing
but g'ood to say about the officers and
ctew of the tug. "A better or abler set
of men I have never seen at work," Is the
way he puts It. In any event, a ship
valued at $150,000. which was thought
would be a total loss, is now safe on port
and can be repaired at comparatively
f-mall expense.
The Edmund was formerly tho British
ship William Tell and was on her maiden
voyage for her new owners. She took a

building in about a year's time. Boys
and girls will probably be taught under
the same roof and the branch school for
boys that Is at present being conducted
under the auspices of the Sisters on Ev
erett street will be dispensed with. The
hew school building will cost about $100,
000.
St. Vlncejit's School was established In
this city by the Sisters of Charity in 1852,
under the charge of Sister Frances Mc-
Ennls. The llrst school was established
on a lot where the Palace Hotel now
stands. In 1873 the Sisters moved Into
their present quarters on Mission street.
The average attendance of pupils is about
430, but there have been as many as 600 in
attendance at one time.
Father Cummings, pastor of St. Pat
rick's Church, will have charge of the
erection of the new school building.

The San Francisco Oil Exchnrge opened
Its doors yesterday in the quarters long
occupied by tbe old Pacific Stock Ex
change on Montgomery street. The occa
t-ion crew a crowd. The opening proceed
ings were brief. The president of tho ex
change, A- Gerberding, delivered an ad
dress, in which he stated tho aims of the
exchange end also adverted to thÂ© condi
tions attending the oil industry of Call
lornia. O. V. Walker, the caller, was in
troduced, and alter instructing the as
eembled brokers concerning tho rules of
the exchange proceeded with the list of
stocks.
Mr. Gerberdir.g's address had several
points of interest In It. Ho said that half
a century ago the. pioneers of California
witnessed the excitement occasioned by
the discovery of gold in this State. Now
the eor.s of these pioneers behold the
cawa of the new century to be illumined
by the light of another great discovery In
Californiaâ that of petroleum. Through
it the problem, of the commercial great
::et-s of California is solved and no fur
ther Quest need bo made for coal. Call
:\>rnia had contributed to the world's cof
:ers a thousand million dollars In pre
cious metals. It was within reasonable
belief that the discovery of oil would
prove to bo cf even greater value,
Mr. Gerberding painted a picture of
what might come from the cil discovery-
"We mtiy even compete with the moun
tain streams, whose electric thrill Is now
fdt on every eide," he said. "We may
eid the miner who is still delving for gold.
WÂ© may propel our ocean steamers as we
crive our trains. We may even feed the
fires that bura In distant lands. This dis
covery means more for California than
ar.y of us can know. Add to our acknowl
edged advantages the facilities for manu
facturing and we overcome at once the
one great obstacle to our progress."
Mr. Gerberding explained the purposo
of the exchange to be to trade in the
thares of corporations formed in good
faltii end hocestiv prosecuting the work
of producing oil. The dir<-ctors asked the
co-operation of all the members in main
taining a high End honorable standard.
For the San Francisco Oil Exchange the
friendly consideration of a!l kindred
bodies was asked. The danger that Mr.
Gtrberding faw to menace the oil indus
try was that of over-capitalization. "Be
ware." he said, "lest early success lead
you astray, lost greed tempt you to error
ar.d thus destroy a great business, splen
didly b^grun. 'Whiie the value of the new
industry cannot be overestimated, it will
be safer to think cf thousands than of
millions."
The officers of the San Francisco Ex
change ere: A- Gerberding, president;
Stephen Otis, vice president; C. Ilirsh
fpid. treasurer; Gustave Pohlmar.n. Eecre
ta.ry: Henry C. McPike. attorney; O. V.
Walker, caller. The directors are A. Ger-
Lerdir.g, C Hirshfcld. P. J. Cadogan,
Walter "tt\ Gollln, Stephen Otis, Henry
C. McPike, Charles F. Kapp. E. Meyer
and W. F. Souie.
The daily sessions of the San Francisco
Kxchar.ge will ba held at 10 a. m. and at
1:20 p. m.
The people of Monterey County are con
fidect that they Â¦will be able to make a
good fhowir.g as oil producers. They be
lieve that State Mineralogist Cooper was
right when he predicted a future for
*?r<n Ardo. The drillers are busv and are
tun king headway.
The u'A City lJ*<Â»rrick thinks that the sul
phur in the Texas cil will destroy its
value as fuel oil, and says that a steam
thip could not cross the ocean in safety,
depondir.R upon Texas oil for fuel. The
explanation of this is that in spraying the
oil for use under boilers a chemical com
bination would be formed that would
closely r*Â»semble sulphuric acid, which
â¢n-otiM prove highly destructive to the
The heavy ralne interfered with the

The Los Angeles Times reports concern.
Ir.g the Los Anreles fields that although
the local petroleum market Is weaker
than It has been In several months de
velopment work continues with much ac
tivity In sal sections. Home operators
Mew the recent decline In prices as the
tasual falling off In the demand for oil at

A correspondent of the Los Anpeles
Times writes the following from Bakers
field:
An Interesting comparison has been made
between the formation on the south side of the
Kern River ar.d that en the north side. A
practical oil man has been carefully watch
ing the formations passed through while slnk-
Ir.g a well on the Eoutli Fide and has found
trait the formations correspond with those of
another treil sunk north of the river on a Cl
j-Â«Â»ct eaÂ«t BBfl vr*?i line with the south side
veil. ThÂ» Similarity tends to make those ln
f r^Ft**? !n the Fouth ride Jubilant.
I>crÂ»utj- Sheriff Dougherty was In Stock
ton recently, having with him samples of
petroleum that he took from his place at
the Junction of Mok'lumne River and Po

â¢JEW YORK. F*b. 29-Tne dread of the un
known was thÂ» depressing factor in the stock
market to-day. Preparations were evidently
bÂ»ine made for the interim or three consecutive
holidays by lightening speculative loads. The
poFSlbilltle* of the three days' Interval which
were canvassed by the rp*-culatlve. public were
by no means wholly on the side of depression.
but whatevt-r favorable developments seemed
r^'dble have been . thoroughly discounted
that tho balance is considered clearly on the
ride at lower 1 rices. The speculative world
reems to have arrived at .the conclusion that
the completion of the details of the steel merger
is not likely to l>e followed immediately by
a carr.rcim of manipulation for higher prices
in order to mnke a market for the new se
curities, lt will !>â¢ remembered that this was
what happened tv.-o year* ago when the pewly

T.ot only doing an enormous traSlc. but are
obtaining better rates, ar.d the community of

result, roads which under former conditions
had no prcrpect of a dividend are now on the

pong found offerings valued somewhat higher
than they were at the close yesterday. May

the market became quiet but firm on moder
ate Northwest receipts and the fact that

NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â Tin In the local mar
ket started in a somewhat depressed manner,
as a result of unfavorable information from
London, where prices went off about Â£1 [a to
Â£121 12s 6d for spot. Later, however, a reac
tion ret in and prices recovered the early loss
on a -cod general demand. Sales were made
at $26 SO and $26 95 for spot delivery, closing
$26 90 bid and $27 asked. Future deliveries were
weak and lower, March at 126 S5Â©26 75 and

NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's financial cableeram says:
Business was much restricted on the Stock
Exchange here to-day, and the tone was unde
cided. The only exceptions were Investment
shares, which were in good demand on the
confident expectation that the bank rate would
bo reduced.
American shares were' the weakest In the
market. There was very little spoculatlve In
terest either way, but bustnss from the start
was dull. Prices sagged until Wall street
opened. On sales from New York realizing
began here among the tired holders. Some
operators in London had a* report to-day that
J. P. Morgan is about to go off on a yachting
cruise, and they Interpreted It as meaning that
he Is unloading or has finished unloading and
that the boom Is over.
Money was light despite the expected lower-
Ing of the bank rate. Silver enjoyed a spurt
on buying for the Indian Government.

NETV YORK. Feb. 20.â To-day's cotton mar
ket was a restless, erratic affair, with bears in
control at the -opening and the close, while
friends of the staple were In possession through
out the time intervening. Disappointment in
Liverpool in response to last nlKhfs sharp up
lift here was general and under selling for
both accounts prices went off 2 to 9 points on
the call. The opening tone was given as steady,
despite the lower prices. Shorts soon took
fright, however, at the crop movement, which
fell far short of predictions.
New York Cotton Market.
The Wool sales for the week in Boston
amounted to 5.305,200 pounds domestic and 965.
000 pounds foreign, making a total of 6,270,200
pounds.
BOSTON, Feb. 20.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter to-morrow will say: The
Wool market has rather increased In activity
the past week, and a large amount of stock
has been moved. We figure the sales at over
6.000,000 pounds, included In which were some
good-sized lines of Territories, scoured and
medium fleeces. - There has teen considerable
pressure to sell, and as a result consumers
have In most Instances been able to secure
Wools at pretty low prices, especially Terri
tory Wools, which are now selling very close
to the level of values prevailing at the time
when the boom in 1S93 was started.

A decline In dairy extras was the only
change. The Butter and Egg markets were
both quoted weak on the Exchange, while
Cheese was eteady. There are no new features
to report. â¢

change were 29,800 pounds of Butter. 1028 cases

California Poultry continues to have the
field to itself, as the several car* of Eastern
en route, and which should have been here
the first of the week, have 'not yet arrived.
Prices are very firm, as will bÂ« seen. But
three cars from the East are announced for
to-day. * Â¦
Receipts of Game were light again, being
only about 50 sacks, but thÂ« demand was
light, and the shipments were not In the best

Potatoes are rather easy, but prices ehow lit
tle variation. Vegetables keep up to the high
prices under moderate receipts.
Onions continue to attract general attention,
owing to their scarcity and firmness. The
recent arrivals from. Oregon, some 160 sks,
were sold yesterday on the wharf at $3, but this
price Is not expected to hold, as there are a
number of cars on the way from Oregon and
Nevada, which are delayed by the storm, and
when they get here a decline Is looked for.
The next Australian steamer, due on the 23th,
Is also expected to bring a liberal consignment.
At the moment, however, the market is very
stiff.

The trust clause in the will of the late
Josephine L. Sanford, which was attacked
by heirs of the deceased, has been sus
tained as valid by Judge Coffey and the
estate was ordered, distributed. The ob
jectionable trust clause reads:
I give and . bequeath to Professor George
Davidson. Dr. C. N. Klllnwood and Andrew S.
Moteley,- an undivided fourth part of Rancho
Los Maganos in trust, however, to receive the
rents issues and profits thereof and apply the
net amount of the game to such extent and

dren of my nephew, John Edward M. Sanford
of Dorchester. Mass., until paid Huntlngton
Sanford ehall attain the age of 21 years, where
upon they shall convey the same to' said Mary
Sanford and Huntlngton Sanford.
It was claimed by Attorney Charles S.
Wheeler, who represents the heirs, that
the clause "To such extent and at such
time or times as in their judgment may
be proper," permits the trustees to hold
the lr.como of tho property as they willed
and hence the clause was contrary to the
statutes against cumulations. Mr. Wheel
er also contended that the trust was "one
to convey" and hence Invalid.
Judge Coffey, however, held that the
points were not well taken and sustained
the trust. . *

Reed plied Jones with questions with a
view to showing that the profits of the
San Francisco Gas Company had largely
Increased since the system of Incandescent
burners had been inaugurated. Jones,
however, said that the company had been
subjected to a great loss by reason of the
destruction of Incandescent lamps and the
high price of anthracite coal.
Reed quoted from the company's state
ment showing the value of the gas and
.electric plant to be 511,500,000 and the net
proilt $G28,117.
"According to your own figures," said
Reed, "the board has allowed you to
make about. $60,000 more than 5 per cent
on your valuation."
"I am prepared," said Jones, "to show
that ?1 50 is a fair price for gas and that
at $140 we can only hope to pay a divi
dend from increased consumption. I do
not ask you to raise the price of gas, but
I ask you not to lower it."
C. O. O. Miller, president of the Pacific
Gas Improvement Company, followed and
practically agreed with Jones regarding
the cost of producing gas.
The board adjourned. to meet Saturday
at 2 p. m. for. the resumption of the in
quiry.

The "Western New York and Pennsyl

here this morning, was stalled in a drift
higher than the engine's stack while
rushing down a huge grade south ,of this
city. It was dug- out with difficulty and
again started on its precarious journey
toward Buffalo. It probably will not get
through to-night. This road is operating
its trains with three engines and has
three plows at work on the tracks. The
worst drifts are at Summerdale, where
they reach a height of twenty feet in
spots.
On the Philadelphia & Erie a snow
plow, jumped the track at Jacksons while
endeavoring, to force its way through a
big drift! Traffic was delayed several
hours. For the first time in many years
this road has been compelled to use snow
plows. The Erie is also compelled to
operate hastily improvised snow plows,
something unheard of on the main line
west of Salamanca.

Wednesday.
Ash Wednesday has come and gone and
during the nex*. fftrty days the Catholic
and Episcopal world will be "temperate
In all things." Yesterday was a busy
day with religious people in all Christian
nations, to whom the holy season of Lent
is of particular significance. In this city
special services were held in the Epis
copal and Catholic churches to awaken re
ligious activity and prepare the members
for the sacred obligations of this observ
ance of the anniversary of the most im
portant events in the Savior's life. Extra
masses were said and the ashes were
blessed and distributed to the congrega
tion. In the evening there was the
rosary, a sermon and the benediction of
tho blessed sacrament.
At St. Mary's Cathedral masses were
said at 6 and 7 o'clock and high mass at
9 o'clock. The ashes wore blessed by His
Grace, the Most Reverend Archbishop
Rlordan. After each mass the ashes were
distributed. In the evening Father Pron
dergast preached and after the service
all who had not previously received the
ashes did so then. At St. Ignatius' the
ashes were blessed at the. 6:30 mass and dis
tributed nt every mass following. An
extra mass was held at 9 o'clock and will
be continued at St. Ignatius' throughout
Lent The rosary was at 7:30 in the even
ing, following which was a sermon by
Father Joseph Mulligan. The benediction
was then given and ashes distributed to
those who had not received them.

YOUNG DUTCHY," former pugil

been sentenced to' five years'
penal servitude in Folsom Prison
for making and uttering a ficti
tious Instrument in furtherance of the
conspiracy, fathered by John M. Chretien,
to loot the estate of the late Joseph Sulli
van Chretien's conviction closely fol
lowed the expose by The Call of the plot
to rob the Sullivan estate. Hansted,
whose connection with the swindle be
came known only after he had departed
for Cape Nome, enjoyed liberty a little
longer. He finally returned to this city,
was placed under arrest and being unablo
to furnish bonds remained In Jail.
He was placed on trial before Judge
Dunne on a charge of making and utter
ing a fictitious instrument. Chretien,
who was responsible for his plight, made
an effort on the stand to shield Han
sted, but he jumbled his statements and
finally unconsciously furnished the evi
dence upon which the conviction of Han
sted was had. After his conviction,
Hansted's counsel moved for a new trial
on his behalf. After elaborate argument
Judge Dunne took the matter under ad
visement. Yesterday he denied the mo
tion.
Hansted was ordered to stand up and
Judge Dunne, after briefly reviewing the
case, and the evidence against the crime,
sentenced him to five years in Folsom.
A stay of execution for thirty days was
granted. A suit of probable cause will be
argued before the. Supreme Court prior

! SUPREME COURT HOLDS
DOCTOR RESPONSIBLE
Patients as He Wishes Learns
Differently.
Physician Who Thinks He Can Treat
The Supreme Court handed down a de
cision yesterday affirming the Judgment
of the lower court which awarded R. J.
Lathrop 12000 in his action for damages
against Dr. P. H. Flood.
Flood, a practicing physician of this
city, was engaged by Lathrop for his
wife, Margaret, who was about to be
confined. The case was properly treated
up to the time of childbirth, and then,
because the suffering woman shrank from
the use of instruments and screamed,
the physician "became disgusted," as he
says, and ordered her to stop crying. His
command was not instantly obeyed, and
after some further surly remarks he put
on his hat and without a word regarding
his intentions left the house.
The agonized husband followed him Into
the street, begging him to return lest
his wife should die. The doctor refused,
saying that there were plenty of physi
cians in the neighborhood. Mr. Lathrop
requested that Flood recommend some
one, and was told: "Get whoever the
devlV you please."
After an interval of an hour another
physician was procured.
The court held that when a physician
has once accepted a case he must devote
the best of his skill and attention to it,
and can leave only on dismissal by his
employer or after he has given due no
tice of dissatisfaction and also - ample
opportunity to procure another physician.
Hence the verdict of the lower court is
upheld.

EDWARD J. POWER,
nf the popular young commander of
\V_^ the League of the Cross Cadets.
is lying In a very precarious con
dition at his home, 1721 Jones
street. Last Sunday the league cadets
met in St. Mary's Cathedral and renewed
their pledges of abstinence. After the
ceremony a dress parade -was held on Van
Ness avenue. While the parade was pass-
Ing In review, which required over half
an hour, Colonel Power stood dressed In
his military uniform without an over
coat, facing the bitter cold wind that
blew down the avenue.
â¢ He contracted a severe cold and Mon
day afternoon, after eating a hearty din
ner, he was taken suddenly ill at his place
of business with a profuse hemorrhage
of the stomach. An ambulance was sum
moned and the Colonel was conveyed Im
mediately to his home, where he has
since been confined. At the present time,
although he is very weak from excessive
loss of blood, no fatal result of his Illness
is anticipated.
Dr. Morrisey of the League of the
Cross, who is attending him, has advised
that he be given several weeks' rest, as
his system has been greatly weakened by
overwork, and it is surmised that this
is the cause of the hemorrhage.
Colonel Power is very popular among
the members of the League of the Cross,
whose Interests he has done so much to
promote, and it is sincerely hoped that
he will soon be able to resume his duties.

Clergyman Declares to Grand, Jury That Mayors Brother^
in-Law Should Be Prosecuted for Renting Buildings to
Slave Owners and Is Referred to Police Courts
THE indictment of Frank J. Sulli
van, brother-in-law of Mayor Phe
lan. on a charge of leasing a por
tion of the Sullivan estate in
Chinatown for Immoral pur
poses, was demanded yesterday afternoon
by Rev. Dr. A. C. Bane before the Grand
Jury.
The investigating body yesterday re
sumed its Inquiry as to â¢ gambling and
other vice In Chinatown. Only two wit
nesses were examined.
Rev. Dr. Bane, when called before the
Grand Jury, was examined as to his
knowledge of vice in Chinatown, his testi
mony being similar to that given before
the legislative investigation committee.
A dramatic scene occurred when the
minister "In forceful terms insisted that
the owners of the brothels in Chinatown
should be indicted. Dr. Bane demanded
as a citizen and a clergyman that Frank
J. Sullivan, the Mayor's brother-in-law,
should be charged with violating the Pe
nal Code in renting property in which the
slave girls were detained and Immorality
flourished.
It was suggested to Dr. Bane that Mr.
Sullivan or other owners of the property
where the dens are situated might deny
that they had any knowledge of the uses
their property was put to.
Dr. Bane answered that if Mr. Sullivan
or others made such an absurd assertion,
it would be best to send for them, and If
necessary' take them into Chinatown and
let them see with their own eyes what
was going on. Judge Dunne and Judge
Murasky Â¦were sent for in order that cer
tain legal propositions might be answered
and the decision given was that the
Grand Judy bad no power to indict Mr.
Sullivan for a misdemeanor, the renting
of property for immoral purposes not be
ing a felony.
Rev. Dr. Bane then stated that he would
secure warrants against Mr. Sullivan and
other owners of the Chinatown dens by
process in the Police Courts.
Rev. Frank K. Baker was also exam
ined by the Grand Jury and gave similar
testimony to that given before the legisla
tive committee. He was asked if he could
recognize "San Jose Charlie," the notori
ous owner of lottery places, in the pres
ence of whom a reporter whom he accom
panied through Chinatown bought a lot
tery ticket. "San Jose Charlie" had
sworn before the Grand Jury that he
never saw a lottery ticket marked In all
his life. Dr. Baker had no trouble In de
scribing the Chinese, and said he was
present when lottery tickets were sold to
the reporter in the minister's presence.
Dr. Baker took the same stand as Dr.
Bane as to the prosecution of the owners
of the Chinese dens of Infamy.
A number of witnesses, including "San
Jose Charlie," were waiting to be exam
ined when the Grand Jury adjourned un
til next Monday evening at 7 o'clock.
The Law and Order League, of which the following: gentle
men compose the committee the Rev. II. A.' Ktslc, the Rev. F\ A.
Doane, I. J. Truman, F. L. Turpln, the Rev. AV. W. White, the
Rev. \V. M. Woodward, the Rev. Dr. Beard and E. C. Gilbert
have Issued the folloirlns addreii to the publlct
The moral people of San Francisco have In the past stood solidly against
that which degrades and destroys manhood. Are we going to surrender that
which has been sained by such persistent effort without orbtest? "We are
now brought face to facÂ« with one of the most serious Issues that could pos
sibly enlist the Interests of every lover of Justice and morality.
The gambling element of our city Is making a strong effort to reopen the
Ingleslde racetrack. Shallwe permit it? The highest and best type of our
citizenship should say, -with one of the most emphatic NOES ever heard in
this city, that it will not be tolerated. â¢ â¢
The matter is to be brought up again at a meeting of the Board of Super
visors next Monday afternoon. The pressure being brought to bear by the
gambling element upon the Supervisors to reopen must be met by a loud,
Btrong protest.
Every citizen who desires to keep this place closed Is called upon to sign
the accompanvins petition and return at once to the Law and Order League,
room. 21, 723 Market street, city.

It is a profound fact that Grape-Nuts
food will furnlfh more nourishment to the
tjetem than bread or meat. Any one can
prove the truth of this statement by trial.
"I can truthfully say the result has far
exceeded my expectations. She Is now
hearty, well, and can run and play as
other rhildren do. I am trying an experi-
ment this Fummer on leaving out meat
altogether for breakfast and using Grape-
Nut* food instead. Thus far we have all
been unusually well, and my men folks
(we are farmer?) i?ay that they do not get
hungry bo Quick when they use Grape-
Nuts food as they used to when they had

There is no home .so dreary or sad, no life
so hard and blighted, no heart po sad and
lonely, that cannot be sÂ«t rleht and kept right
after a visit to this Inspired prophet of modern

ternational Union. The employers are
willing to submit the matter to arbitra
tion but will not appoint their representa
tives until after the association has been
recognized by the Labor Council.
The schedule agreed upon by the team-
Eters fixes the wages ot members of the
union as follows: Four horse teamsters,
two-horse brick wagons and two-horse
brick cart teamsters. $2 50 per day: two
horse teamsters, one-horse wagon and
cne-horse cart tramsters, $2 25 per day;
hours, from 6:30 a. m. to 5:30 p. m.; team
ster to have his horses harnessed and
hitched by 6:30, also to take care of his
team in the evening,- thus bringing the
hours of labor really from 6 a. m. to 6
The union asks for the abolition of the
camp and boarding-house system, by
means of which the wages of teamsters
are said to be materially reduced by the
contractors who keep camps or compel
their employes to board in a house named
by them. The teamsters* will fight the
trip system, by which it is claimed their
members are often compelled to work
from twelve to sixteen hours a day and
then 'receive inadequate pay; The union
intends protecting the rights of teamsters
employed in hauling sand, rock or brick,
cr those doing grading work and lorce
the employers and contractors to pay
wages commensurate with the services
rendered. While the strike has been or
dered there is no intention of .working
any hardship on the contractors. The Un
ion Is willing to waive the schedule on
new contracts entered Into prior to the
issuance of the wage schedule.
The strikers met last night and dis
cussed measures looking toward a peace
ful and satisfactory adjustment of the
trouble. The men. were greatly encour
aged by reports received from those who
are handling the strike. There has not
been any break in the ranks and the em
ployers are gradually acceding to the de
mands of the men. The situation looks

PLANS TO REDEEM
TEACHERS' CLAIMS
City Attorney Lane Declares
They Shall Be Paid by
Special Tax.
City Attorney Lane Is 'outlining a plan
by which the school teachers and all
others who have Just claims against the
city may be paid. Lane holds that the
surplus fund remaining In the city treas
ury at the end of the fiscal year cannot
be used for the purpose, as the constitu
tional amendment adopted by the people
provides for the levying of a special tax.
This will mean but four months' delay
when the tax budget will be fixed to go
into effect July 1, 1901.
Lane says that the teachers should not
be required to pay lawyers' fees for the
collection of their claims. He believes
that there will be no necessity for obtain
ing a final Judgment, as they will have
no difficulty In proving their claims.
When they are properly presented to the
Board of Supervisors and to the Auditor
they will be paid In 'full. Lane disagrees
with the Auditor regarding final Judg
ments, and contenas that when a claim
Is reduced to a judgment it can only be
paid out of the revenue of the year in
which it was incurred. He is of the opin
ion that final Judgments against the city
have lapsed. .
Lane will recommend that the surplus
fund be applied to municipal betterments,
such as new streets aJid other improve
ments. The city's debts, he insists, must
be paid according to the constitutional
amendmentâ that is, by .special levy. This
will mean that the ' estimated surplus of
$220,000 will be spent for public improve
ments, i - Â¦ Â¦ .
BOY'S BODY IS SWEPT

Benny Bridges Falls Off Culvert ac
Mouth of Islais Creek and Is

Benny Bridges, the 10-year-old son of
Benjamin Bridges, a boilermaker, resid

day afternoon In South San Francisco.
Benny, with three other young compan
ions, were out for a walk along Kentucky
street and while romping about the
mouth of Islais Creek he fell off the cul

was drawn out Into the bay by the ebb

water rushes under this culvert at the
speed of a millrace and sweeps anything
in its path far out Into the bay. Several
persons at once tegan a search for the
body but up to night time no tidings of

The scheme of representatives of the
Ppruce Package Company to destroy doc
umentary evidence which would have been
dangerous to the corporation in a suit
now pending before Judge Mura?kywa.i
the theme yesterday of widespread com
ment in the business community. The
men who ordered the destruction of the
evidence are accusing one another of the
most serious Indiscretion in permitting
Themselves to discuss the matter even to
their closest friends. Publicity in an af
fair of sis<?h moment :s likely to be ex
tremely dangerous, but the facts are out
and the gossips are wondering what the
next 5tep in the scandalous affair will be.
Superior Judge .Murasky has had tho
matter called to birf attention, but he
pays he will do nothing until his notice
is directed to the aftair by counsel in the
case. He is deeply interested and when
the assistance of ihe court is sought he
will take such actio". as the circumstances
Ffem to require. ThÂ«? whole sensational
incident will, however, be brought to the
notice of Judge Murasky nn Monday.
While the Spruce Package Company .s
not technically in contempt of the Su
perior Court for naving ordered the de
struction of the documents involved, the
insinuation remains that these papers
rr.ust have been of an incriminating na
ture or no â¢ ffort would have been made
to destroy them.
The papers not having been demanded
in court nor produced no offense against
the dignity of the court has been com
mitted. This, however, will not protect
the defendants from being asked to pre
sent the papers, to destroy which so de
termined an effort has been made. On
Monday it is expectÂ«'O that an offer will
be made to prove. that the Spruce Pack
age Company did enter into Illegal con
tracts with the three Portland mills.
This offer will invoive the production of
the contracts if they are in existence. A
demand will be mado for them if Meril
lion, the plaintiff m the case, is allowed
to offer proof that they were made. A
stubborn effort will be made to prevent
the production of such proof on the
ground that a State court cannot discuss
it. It has been contended in this case
that since an interstate issue is involved
the Fuit must be tried in a federal court.
Merllllon on the otrur hand contends that
Fince his action has been taken against
the American Box Factory and not
against the Spruce i\iekage Company the
interstate issue becomes altogether sub-
Fidiary to the State contest. .
Merillion asks simply that the Ameri
can Box Factory be prevented from con
tinuing Jn an association which is in vio
lation of I'nited States laws, lit* simply
atks permission to show that a corpora
tion organized under State laws and ope
rating within the boundarifs of the State
be prevented from 'Incoming party to a
scheme to \iolate interstate laws. Fear
ful that his offer to prove the illegal char
acter of the interstate operations of the
Spruce Package Company, the contracts
of that concern were ordered destroyed.
He will ask. therefore, the privilege of
proving the alleged violation of the Sher
man act by the Spruce Package Company.
If he is permitted to do this he will de
mand that the contracts between the
Spruce Package Company and the three
Portland corporations be produced in
court. The issue is an extremely interest
ing one and has never before been pre
sented in a Htate court.
The Sherman act provides that no cor
poration or association of men shall en
ter into a combination to prevent compe
tition ajid raise prices. It is contended
that the Spruce Package Company com
mitted this very offense by entering into
a deal with the Portland corporations not
to 6ell box lumber to any one In Califor
nia except to the Spruce Package Com
pany. This naturally gave to the local
company a monopoly of the trade.
The affair has now reached such a se
rious stage that the attorneys in the case
declined yesterday to discuss it. as the
Fuit Js in progress and every effort must
be made to avoid even the appearance of
contempt. The startling developments in
the litigation have raided several inter
esting emeries. Business men are trying
to discover who acted as the representa
tives of the Spruce Package Company
when the contracts were made with the
Portland corporations. It is understood
that two men made the deal, but who
They are Is not generally known, and
those who are interested are taking ex
cellent care not to tell.
Edmund Rostand's Masterpiece Is Splendidly Produced at
the Grand Opera-Houseâ Bernhardt Appears as Roxane
and Gives Interest to a Somewhat Insignificant Part
By L. Du Pont Syle.
SO many bottles of ink have been
exhausted and so many yards of
pencil have Been used up in writ
ing about "Cyrano de Bergerac"
that it is unnecessary, In speak
ing of last night's performance, to do
anything more than point out briefly
wherein that rendition differed from oth
ers with v/hich we nrÂ« familiar.
In the first place the production as a
Epectacle alone was good beyond expec
tation. Unless I am much mistaken the
beautiful and elaborate scenery we saw
last' night is the same as that used in
the Porte Saint Martin, where the play
was originally brought out. The second
actâ La Rotisserle &as Poetesâ is set with
peculiar care; nothing presented by the
Grau Opera Company can compare with
this for beauty and effectiveness. Good
also, though not so good, were the rep
resentation a 1' Hotel de Bourgogne (act
1) and the battle Â«-ene (act IV). The
management of the numerous mob scenes,
tho costumes and the color effects left
nothing to be desired.
As to the acting, Roxane is a weak,
insignificant part, yet Mme. Bernhardt
never allowed it to become dull or unin
teresting. I do believe sh.e will die
young, for last night she did not look
a day over twenty-five. M. Deuenbourg,
who was the very worst apology for a
Hippolyte I ever saw, made an excellent
Christian, and M. Desjardln tossed off the
part of De Guiche with an ease and
celerity that were perhaps too evidently
contemptuous. Coquelln as Cyrano was
magnificent, barring- the occasional use
of a derisively falsetto tone that seems
to me out of keeping with the part. His
death scene showed him possessed of a
really tragic power that he has devel
oped only of recent years and of whose
existence in so pronounced a comedian I
was somewhat skeptical until I saw it
demonstrated last night.
What a pity that so accomplished an
artist should not be above the petty van
ity of spoiling a tragic tableau by eager
ness to respond to curtain calls. Such
a weakness is pardonable, perhaps, in
comedy, where the only object aimed at
is amusement; but in tragedyâ never!

CLARK TALKS
OF NEW ROAD
Declares He Has No Inten
tion of Selling Out to
Harriman.
Senator W. A. Clark of Montana paid a
flyinp visit to San Francisco yesterday.
He declared positively that the recent
Harrlman syndicate deal would in no way
interfere with the construction of his pro
posed San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt
Lake Railroad.
Senator Clark claims that englneeers
are already in the field sun-eying a route
between Los Angeles and Redlands. This
force of men will continue its work the
entire way to Salt Lake. He positively
denies that he has made any overtures to
sell out to the Harriman syndicate or for
an exchange of traffic out of Salt Lake.
The Senator also denied that he had
made or contemplated any agreement,
traffic or otherwise, with the Burlington
people. It is stated by men who are in a
position to know something about railroad
combinations that Clark's road and the
Burlington are bound to come together
sooner or later. The Burlington road is
gradually working west from, its Ne
braska terminus, and will, it is expected,
eventually reach Salt Lake. From there
on to Los Angeles and the coast the nat
ural and only direct route would be over
Clark's road.
"The Harrlman syndicate deal, absorb
ing the Southern Paciflc and Union Paci
fic roads, tioes not interfere with my orig
inal plans in the least," said Senator
Clark. "Statements to the effect that I
was willing to sell out are erroneous. Men
are surveying from Los Angeles to Red
lands, and they wHl continue all the way
to Salt Lake. I am in possession of two
surveys that have already been made
from Salt Lake to Nevada," but I am not
content with these and will at the con
clusion of the engineers' work select
from the three the route which I consider
the best. I will build direct to 'Salt Lake
City." -Â±Â±2
