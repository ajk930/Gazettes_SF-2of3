Fp^clal Difpatch to The Call.
ETTREKA, FVb. 13.â George H. Springrr.
a San Francisco merchant, who has been
vainly searching this coast since la$t Max-
Tor his Infant son. who was kidnaped
by A. M. Coleman. In whose charge the
child vrzs placed, arrived here to-day.
His Quest had at last brought success, for
hÂ« had discovered his boy at Scotia, a log
ging town, thirty miles south of here. H<*
brought the child with him and will leave
for his home In San Francisco to-morrow.
When the people of Scotia heard tho
father's story of how he had followed
Coleman and his wife from San Francisco
to Oregon and back again, and when he
h&d shown Fympathlzlng women the body
cf his lltt'e one. bruised and covered with
nres from beatingrs administered by Cole
man. the citizens determined to rid their
community of Coleman. Mlllmen hastily
gathered -with the Intention of administer
ing a coat of tar and feathers. When
they reached the tent in which Coleman
â¢was living, they found that he had
*>sraj*>d, taking his wife with him. If
Coleman can be located it Is likely the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children will take the case in hand.
Coleman obtained possession of the
child in San Francisco by answering an
advertisement to the effect that the child
would be given away to any respectable
family that wouIJ rear and take proper
care of it. At that time the father was
In reduced circumstances, caused by the
long Illness of his wife, which terminated
In her death on the birth of the babe

The Colcmar.s were given possession of
the little cne on probation. Springer
wishing- to aee-ure himself that hfcÂ» rnrrn
'K-ou'd be properly treated before allowing
them to adopt him.
It was net long before Springer dis
covered that the boy was not as tenderly
cared for as he had been led to believe.
Fprfr.ger informed the Colemans that the
baby would be taken from them as soon
Â£s another home could be obtained. In
the meantime the child was to be placed
In an orphan asylum.
When the father again visited the home
rf the Colemans on May 13 he found it de-
Ferted. A ?quad of detectives was de
tailed on the case and a thorough search
made. No trace of the fugitives coulfi be
discovered. By chance, some months
later, Springer heard that the Colemans
Â¦were In Cook County, Or. He Immediately
pet out In pursuit, but on his arrival
found that they had been informed of his
coming and departed. Several times
later he learned of their whereabouts, bu;
each time arrived too late.
It was by the merest chance that Cole
man was located at Scotia. He was
Â¦working under the name cf Adams. A
paper containing the notice of the death
of Coleman's mother in Cook County. Or..

detectives were looking for as the kid

notified the Sheriff's office. Under Sherirt

Ppringer. He lost no time In coming to
Jluroboldt.
When the father reached Scotia he
found Colerr.an living in a tent Within
the tent was a square box which served
the child equally for playhouse and bed.
. This he shared at night with two large
dogs. The little boy was clad in a thin
calico dress, which could not keep out the
cold. His shrunken body was covered
â¢with bruises and running sores. The babe
had not been bathed in weeks, j
As soon as the story was heard on the
streets of Scotia milliards and woods
men formed a party to tar and feather

man learned what was on foot and with
his wife made a hasty flight. He was
pursued and when overtaken stood at bay
and threatened to shoot any one who
came near him. As no one In the, crowd
was armed, they had to abandon the pun

at Alton, six miles from Scotia. He was
in a hotel when Springer and his baby
Fon arrived from Scotia on their way to
Eureka, but wisely kept out of Elznt.

lest his business through the continued
Illness of his wife. When she died he was
left with three children, one a tiny babe.
Finding that it xras impossible for him
to provide for the proper care of the little
cne. he decided to find some family that
vould adopt it. A. M. Coleman. who took
the baby, was at one time a milkman liv

During her stay Mrs. Nation made In
effectual attempts to Interview the city
officials. She also made unsuccessful at
tempts to interview prisoner*.
She departed with the a?sertion that the
rum power In this city and other large
places In the United States was tottering
to its fall.
"Now I am goins back home for a few
weeks." she declared as she closed, "and.
as I have got through out thÂ«re and will
not be long, I will be back here again,
and if the authorities have done nothing
and are willing to do nothing we will see
what is best to be dÂ«ne. and II it la neces
sary we will go to smashing things. We
will make some souvenirs. I tell you."
The saloon-keeper replied that he was
making an honest living. This called
down a torrent of wrathful, words, and
after Informing him that* he was a "mur
derer," "devil's scullion." etc., Mrs. Na
tion departed.
To-night her meeting at "Wlllard Hall
was attended by about 300 people, nearly
all of them temperance people, who ap
plauded everything she .said. Her talk
was not long, and In closing sha declared
that she did' not want any hatchets used,
and that she believed In peaceable means
of closing saloons as far as possible.
"How do you think that he would like
to see you In this bus'nes3?" she de
manded.
Previous to calllnc at this saloon sha

prietor remarked that he was a relative
of Captain Dreyfus of the French army.
"You'd better ask vour grandson." wai

ple she found there, a motley throng, em
bracing all classes. Mrs. Nation mounted
a table and for fifteen minutes talked
with great energy, urging her hearers to
abandon both the use and sale of Hauor
and denouncing in the most unmeasured
terms all those who permitted "ts sale. As
she left the place she accosted a woman
who possessed a rich black eye.
"My. my, what a otty! "Who gave that

Mrs. Nation Did Not Accomplish
RETURNS TO TOPEKA.
This morning's attack was decided upon
at a secret meeting held In* the Baptist
church last night. The crusaders met at
the church by prearrangement this morn
ing and marched directly to the Schmidts*
place, beginning the assault without the
least warning.
The greatest excitement followed the
raid, and for a time serious trouble
seemed likely, and the Mayor called a
special meeting of the Council to plan
means of quelling the disturbance and
providing against further outbreaks. To
night he decided that all Joints must close
at once. A mass tneÂ«tlrig was held to
night and an attack on other Joints Is
expected before morning. The Jolntlst*
are defiant and bloodshed Is feared.
The Schmidts ran- to the front door and
attempted to defend their property. Rev.
Charles Lowther prevented Charles
Schmidt from entering the place by strik
ing him with an ax. The blow was a
glancing one and made * only a scalp
wound. As he fell to the ground, Henry
Schmidt made a gun play in defense of
his brother that nearly ccst him his life.
One of the crusaders, following up the
preacher's attack, had raised an ax to
strike Henry Schmidt, when a companion
wrested the weapon from his hand.
WIXFIELD. Kans.. Feb. 13.â A mob of
20O men and Â¦women raided Schmidt's sa
loon; the finest In the city, at an early
hour to-day. Some of them fired a half
dozen shots -with shotguns through the
front door, that started . a general on
slaught with rocks and guns on the win
dows and doors. Emma Denny received
a pistol ball In her face and was slightly
hurt. Although this, -was an accident tt
served to enrage the mob and the cru
saders swarmed Into the saloon. There
they found Charles and Henry Schmidt.
After driving them from the bulletins
through the rear door, the mob created
havoc right and left. Cigar cases, mir
rors and pictures Â»were smashed, and
those that could not be reached with axes
were Â»hot full of holes. The mahogany
bar was hacked to splinters, bottles were
broken and barrel ends knocked In. This
was the work of but a few minutes.

"The law in New York allows the Chief.
of Police to Issue warrants for that class
of offenders and this suggestion la made
because it would aid* the police to act

Chief had&^he power to Issue warrants it
would help them in a great way. I would
suggest this power for the Chief so that
he could act in Issuing : warrants Irre

Mr. Dunne then discussed the Penal
Code relating to lottery games and then
suggested to the committee that a law
might be passed similar to one operating
in New York City, by which the Chief of
Police would have the power to Issue war

:Mr. Dunne said that the Police Depart

and was not a party to a controversy.
He suggested that as the Penal. Code
provided for certain kinds of evidence In,
various cases, the Legislature should
pass a law which might cover the cases of
gambling by Chinese in fantan games.
"Sergeant Christensen has summed the
matter up right," said Mr. Dunne. "It Is

to get the evidence and hard to secure a

"I did." â¢ . ---
Mr. Knowlandâ You said Just now that

"Yes; it would take men of strong char

Chairman Knowland â Did you break up
gambling to any extent?
"We brought about its termination
while the squad operated. I was there
with Captain Wittman all the time, from

like Sergeant McManus, with thirty men,
could eliminate the gamblers."
"How?"
- "By constantly harassing them. The

BIGGY REMOVED
FOR BEING ZEALOUS
And so the Examiner's investigation
was brought to a close In short order.
Mr. Blggy was called to the witness
stand after the "star chamber" meeting
and the farce went on.
Judge Laird conducted the examination,
which was as follows:
"What is your name?" "William J. Blg
gy."
"Where do you reside?" "At Â£50 Va- !
lencia street."
â¢ "How long have you lived in this city?"
"I was born here."
"Have you ever held a position In the
Police Department?" "I was Chief."
"While Chief of the department did you
have any experience in Chinatown aB to
making arrests of gamblers?" "I did."
"Tell us what your experiences were?"
"On'sssumint? the duties of Acting Chief
I consulted with the various captains of
the department. The Chinese district was
under the control of Captain Wittman
and I confined myself to his confidence
as far as my operations in Chinatown
were concerned. I gave my personal su
pervision as to the selection of the men
I wanted to work with. I took the best
fifteen men in the department. I divided
them into three, squads, each squad under
the direction of a sergeant, the squads
being under the order of Captain Witt
man and myself. I familiarized myself
with the provisions of the law and then
endeavored to close up the fantan games.
In this connection I will say that at the
time there was a highbinder war in pro
gress between the Suey Sings and the Hop
Sings. I was most anxious to stop the
war. I acted also against the notorious
resort known as â¢ the Nymphla and also
against the Chinese and Japanese houses
of ill fame.
It was known on Tuesday that Mr. Big
gy was to be called before the committee
and in expectation of the testimony he
might give as to the Mayor's compact
with the Examiner by which Lieutenant
Esola was to have been made successor
of Chief Lees, a large audience filled the
courtroom where the committee has taken
testimony.
But not a word was Mr. Biggy allowed
to say which would hold, the Mayor and
the Examiner up to the scorn of the peo
ple of this city.
Before Mr. Biggy was placed on the wit
ness stand the entire legislative commlt-
Fearing an expose of Its shameful com
pact made with Mayor Phelan that the
San Francisco Police Department should
be turned over to the Examiner and one
of its pets made Chief of Police, the Ex
aminer yesterday held its lash over the
head of the legislative Investigation com
mittee and deliberately choked off the
testimony of ex-Chief of Police Blggy be
fore the committee.
Nature of Examination of ex-Chief
Biggy Is Arranged in "Star
Chamber" Session.
Attorney Joseph Coffey was then sum
moned before the committee and Informed
that his conduct in Issuing a subpena for
Charles S. Cram, the lying protege of the
Examiner, was so reprehensible that ho
must appear to-morrow at noon before
the bar of the Assembly to answer. The
committee then adjourned to meet at Sac
ramento to-morrow morning.
In secret session' It has already taken
the testimony of Chinese who swear that
they paid bribe money to Sergeant
Biophy with the understanding that Cap
tain Wittman was to receive a share.
The names of these Chinese will be given
to the police.
LEGISLATORS OBEY
EXAMINER'S BEHEST
And the investigators kept their prom
ise to the pleading newspaper. Assem
ble man Laird insisted upon questioning
Blggy when he was placed upon the stand
and all questions which would have led to
the expose of the Examiner were scrupul
ously avoided. Biggy related the story
of his brief experience as Acting Chief of
Police in Chinatown and was then in
formed that the committee had decided
not to permit him to testify upon any
other point. This announcement of the
committee that it did not want to know
the truth In a proceeding ostensibly
honest and impartial provoked a derisive
laugh in the courtroom.
This representative knew also that
Blgsy would reveal every fact In the dis
honest bargain, and he implored that
nothing which wpuld injure the Exam
iner be permitted to become part of the
testimony in the case. The Examiner was
ready to end the inquiry. It had proved
not a single charge, but it had not another
witness to offer. It was fearful of Blggy,
and behind him was the shadow of Ser-,
geant Price, who had been removed from
Chinatown. at the instigation of the Ex
aminer and for a bribe of $10,000. which a
witness said had been received by the
men who fought Price. The legislative
inquiry had become a boomerang and the
Examiner representative pleaded with all
the eloquence at his command. Â«Â¦ .
In secret session 'the legislative com
mittee took a vote and decided that it
wculd not permit Blggy to testify to any
fact which would prove the circumstance3
under which the Examiner attempted by
a corrupt compact to gain control of the
Police Department through Mayor Phe-'
Ian. Assemblymen Laird." "Webber, Schil
lig- and Wright voted thus to destroy the
whole purpose of the inqulry^and Assem
blyman Knowland voted not to do so.
The committee had sworn to make an Im
partial inquiry and in this vote a majority
of its members had deliberately, at the
command of a newspaper, noticeably
prejudiced, had decided to shut out testi
mony which would have had a vital bear-
Ing upon the whole case. This testimony
would have established the revengeful
motive of the prosecutor, which, In con
junction with the fact that no direct tes-!
tlroony of any sort, supporting the allega
tions of corruption against the police had
been introduced at the investigation,
would have had an important bearing
upon the whole issue.

poses. The representative of the Exam

committee to prevent Blggy from expos

hatched to prostitute the department.

COOKS RUN AMUCK
concern to the Examiner not to have
these facts revealed under oath. The rep
resentative of that newspaper knew that
Blggy would swear that he had received
his appointment as Police Commissioner
at the command of the managing editor
of the Examiner and with the understand
ing that his vote was to be given to the
egent of the Examiner bo that the man
aging editor of that sheet might secure
control of the Police Department and ma-
Mayor Fhelan had entered with the man

It was a matter of the deepest possible
facts of the corrupt compact into which
he represents to be held up to public scorn
and ridicule. He pleaded that Blggy bo
prevented from proving: under oath the
satisfy a revenge for lost profit. Assem
blyman Webber, who again illumined the
proceedings yesterdsy with his presence,
went so far as to make himself noticeably
a special prosecutor for the Examiner.
Under public pressure, however, the Ex
aminer decided to permit the committee
to call Biggy as a witness. But the mem
bers were given to understand that they
coujd ask the ex-Police Commissioner and
Â«x-Acting Chief of Police only certain
Questions. The Examiner was in sore
straits. Its attempt to secure control of
the Police Department for its own uses
had already been exposed. Its corrupt
connection with the dismissal of Sergeant
Price had already been more than hinted
at, and it did not dare risk the further
shame In which It would be involved by
a. true statement from Biggy.
When the investigating committee met
yesterday morning, therefore. It went Into
executive session at the request of the
Examiner to discuss the predicament of
that newspaper. All thought of further
prosecution cf the Police Department was
abandoned; the Examiner had now to pre
vent another of its scandalous acts from
being made public In an official Inquiry.
In this secret session of the legislative
commute* E. J. llvernash, representing
the Examiner, addressed, the investigators
and begged them not to permit the paper
Examiner passed through several unhappy
days in fear of a corroboration of this
condemning testimony, and yesterday It
de-legated an agent to plead with the ;om-
Tnlttee not to permit the incriminating tes
timony to be given.
William J. Bigrgy was the witness of
whom the Examiner was fearful. For
Fcveral days representatives of the guilty
newspaper prevailed upon a majority of
the legislative committee not to place
Big?ry upon the witness stand. Every
member of the committee, with the ex
ception cf Assemblyman Joseph Know
land, was ready to do what the Examiner
commanded. The investigators pledged
themselves to conduct an Impartial in
quiry, and four of them so far forgot their
dignity as to become simply the agent of
a newspaper which was attempting to
THE legislative Investigation of
the Police Department closed
yesterday In a most unusual
scene. The entire object of at
tack vras changed, and for the
first time perhaps in the his
tory of the city a newspaper
of San Francisco besreed and
pleaded for mercy from a body of official
lnvc-stipators. The Examiner, which had
been so actively malicious in its unproved
sccusatlons against the police, found lt
f-elt on th<? defensi\-e as the inquiry was
about to close, and it sent one of Its
agents to implore the Assembly commit
tee not to expose it% methods further to
the public.
Ever since Mayor Phelan was on the
Â¦witness stand the Examiner has had this
fear of exposure. It had failed utterly
to prove one of Its accusations. It had
shown that gambling: and social vice are
offensive in Chinatowji and that the slave
trade Is in existence In the district. But
these were neither new nor disputed facts.
The public knew them and the police ad
mitted them. Nothing was shown to prove
that the policy of the police was criminal
or inadequate, and as far as bribery was
concerned the public heard nothing which
possessed f ven the merit of hearsay testi
mony.
When Mayor Phelan testified he went
eo far as to criminate himself in orde.r
to show that the Examiner had used every
Influence at its command to prostitute the
Police Department to the uses of the man
eger of the Examiner. The details of a
corrupt political bargain were given, and
under oath Mayor Fhelan testified that
the Examiner persisted in denouncing him
because he did not sell the Police Depart
ment to the scheming newspaper. The
tee was closeted with Mr. Llvernash of
the Examiner In, a private room.
The Examiner's representative begged,
pleaded and threatened by turn that Mr.
Bigpy be not allowed to state under oath
what he knew of the compact made by
Mayor Phelan and the Examiner, for,
like a criminal, It fearedi the light of ex
posure.
Chairman Knowland was forced ' to put
the matter to a vote and his fellow com
mltteemen did the bidding of the Exam
iner. Judge Laird. Webber, Schlllig and
WrlKht all voted that Mr. Blggy should
not be allowed to give the evidence which
the Examiner feared.
J' H E question which was asked when the investigators from the Assembly began their inquiry
into the affairs of the police, is still unanswered. The committee has adjourned and still the
query remains: Is the Police Department of Sail Francisco corrupt in its relations to the Chinese t
'Absolutely 110 light, that is not shadowed by the doubts of per jury and self-interest, has been shed upon
the question. It has been proved that gambling, social vice and a particularly degrading form of slaveryK
exist in Chinatown, but this was knozvn to the public and admitted by the police.
More testimony has been introduced to shozv that the police were vigilant in their duty rather than
that they were net. The difficulties of suppressing crime in the Chinese district were demonstrated and
remedies in law and policy were suggested. The utter worthlessness of Chinese testimony was established
and no white man could give testimony of corruption more valuable than hearsay.
On the ether hand, the inquiry unquestionably was degraded into a special, prejudiced prosecu
tion by a revengeful newspaper, to whose commands a majority of the investigating committee bowed,
going even so far in its last session as to announce that it did not want to know the truth when the,
truth meant the exposure of the corrupt schemes by which this newspaper bargained with Mayor)
Phclan to secure control of the Police Department for its own selfish purposes.'}.
The inquiry was not, however, altogether profitless. It proved that an honest officer was' driven
cut of Chinatown by the Examiner and others and that Chinese gamblers and highbinders paid the.oppo
nents of^this officer $10,000 to secure his removal. The corrupt compact between Mayor Phelah and
the Examiner to gain control of the Police Department was admitted by the Mayor himself under oath.
These facts alone justify the existence and activity of the investigating committee.

THE EXAMINER TO BE SAVED FROM EXPOSURE
Investigating Committee Refuses to Receive Testimony of Vital Importance==Attorney Coffey
Cited for ContemptâWilliani J. Biggy Makes Sensational Expose of Phelan's Cunning Plot.
Jt T is extremely fortunate far Mayor.Phelan and his ex-partner â¢,
the Examiner, that William J. Biggj was not permitted by the
legislative investigators to tell yesterday what he knozvs of the
disgraceful compact made by the Mayor with the nezvspaper to
degrade the Police Department into a machine of corrupt self-inter
est. Mr. Biggy was seen last night and expressed his regret that
the investigating committee had been so fearful of the truth. "They
caged me in one of their rooms " he said, "secreted thentselves in an
other, and when I was placed on the witness stand declined to hear
â¢what I know to be of material bearing upon this entir inquiry.
"I wanted to prove to this committee that Mayor Phelan at~
tempted to sell the Police Department of this city to the managing edi
tor of the Examiner, and when he swore that he 'did not he com
mitted perjury. I wanted to prove to the satisfaction of the inves
tigating committee that the chief executive of 'Â¦San Francisco and the
Examiner entered into a corrupt bargain to use the police power of
the municipality as an engine for private profit and that in this
whole disgraceful, shameful affair Mayor Phelan has been a liar off
the stand and a perjurer upon it. I have no feeling against Mayor
Phelan, and in my discussion of this lamentable business I want to
be prejudiced only in/his favor; but I believe that the people of San
Francisco should have been permitted to learn, through a judicial pro
' ceeding and in statements under oath, the limit of daring to which
Mayor -Bhelqn and the Examiner went to secure control of a power
which may be made of great good or tremendous evil.
"i* wanted to tell the committee of investigation under oath
that Mayor Phelan gave the entire selection of the Police Commis
sion to A. M. Lawrence, managing editor of the Examiner, for the
sole purpose of insuring the election of Esola as Chief of Police. I
..'â¢-'â¢ A wanted to tell the investigators
1 that Mayor Phelan swore to a lie
when he declared that he would
not grant the demand of Law
rence. Mayor Phelan coerced tlie
Commissioners of Police in every
possible way to secure the election
of Esola. When he had threat
ened me past the limit of endur
ance I said to him: ' Mayor Phe
lan, if you insist upon the election
of Esola as Chief of Police the
people of San Francisco will do
everything to you except spit upon
you in the streets, and if I agree
to do as you demand of me they
will spit upon me. Every reput
able interest in the city is opposed
to this plot. It is a diabolical
scheme to milk the town.'
v ' "/ 'wanted to tell the investigat

Lack of votes Is the secret of this
change of heart More time must be had
to work upon members, to mollify them
by the insertion of amendments that, will
satisfy their whims without vitiating the
powers conferred by the bills: upon the
State Board of Health to, enter upon a
policy of nagging the Federal quarantine
officers. More time must be had to let
members become fully cognizant of. the
fact that unless they support these pet
measures their own bills will not receive
favor in the executive office. A â¢week is
the time figured upon by the partisans
of the bills as necessary to accomplish
this change of votes. Good men have al

DOG-SALMON" SOLD
\ AS HIGH-CLASS FISH
British Columbia Legislature Will
Stop Fraudulent Labeling of
Shipments.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Feb. 13.-ThÂ© Brit
ish Columbia Legislature has promised to
take actipn to put a stop to the practice
of fraudulently labeling salmon canned ln
this province. In recent shipments, espe
cially to England, large consignments of
ilsh have been fraudulently labeled to in
sure their sale at high prices.
Owing to the prolonged strike of fisher
men the canners lost heavily on the pack
of sockeyes, which are the choicest sal
mon and fetch the highest price. Suc
ceeding the sockeye run was the less de
sirable cohoe. or white salmon, and fol
lowing them came the dog-salmon. It is
claimed by members of the canners* com
bine that these dog-salmon, which are a
low class food, were. packed and sold by
unprincipled dealers to green buyers as
the more expensive and finer brand of
fish, and to carry out the bunko game
were stamped with the gorgeous red and
gold labels which it had been intended to
use on the more expensive brands. By
these -wholesale frauds the dishonest sal
mon dealers made a lot of money and
buyers paid twice as much as the article
was worth.
Tha -seventy-five big packers of British
Columbia have had no hand in this alleged
fraud, and they are now anxious that the
Pro-vinclal Legislature should pass a
stringent act compelling all canners to
truthfully label the contents of their cans.

suggestion to make the bill a special or

for to-day. Senators with bills far down

out that If the code bills were to be con

this session, and there are members of

there Is something else besides codes in
the realm of legislation.
*It was then that two suggestions were
made, one to devote night sessions to the
consideration of the code and the other
to let the codes go for this session and
consider them at an extra session. This
latter course met general favor, for by
that time the proposition had reached the
ears of the Assembly: but the Governor
was Interviewed on the subject and he
put hia foot down. The codes must be

Johnson went to leading members of the
opposition this morning and said frankly
that he was making the fight for the bills
for men higher in power. Unexpected op
position had developed, much to the dis
tress of friends of the bills, and in order
to avoid the continuance of the bitter con
test he desired time to consult with the
higher powers, whose bills these were, and
ascertain if amendments might not be in

Johnson's diplomacy was also exhibited
in recalling bill 558 from engrossment, the

A NEW DEPARTURE t
A New, Effectual and Convenient
Cure for Catarrh.
Of catarrh remedies there is no end, but
of catarrh cures there has always been a
great scarcity. There are many remedies
to relieve, but very few that really cure.
The old practice of snuffing salt water
through the nose would often relieve and
the washes, douches, powders and in-
halers in common use are very little, if
any. better than the old fashioned salt
water douche.
The use of Inhaler3 and the application
of salves, washes and powders to the nosÂ»e
and throat to cure catarrh is no mor*
reasonable than to rub the back to euro
kidney disease. Catarrh is just as much
a blood disease as kidney trouble or rheu-
matism, and it cannot be cured by local
treatment any more than they can be.
To cure catarrh, whether in the head,
throat or stomach., an internal antiseptic
treatment is necessary to drive the ca-
tarrhal poison out of the blood and sys-
tem, and the new catarrh cure is designed
on this plan and the remarkable success
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is because
being used Internally It drives out ca-
tarrhal Infection through action upon
stomach, liver and bowels.
"VVm. Zimmerman of St. Joseph, relates
an experience Â¦with catarrh which is of
value to millions of catarrh sufferers
everywhere. He says, "I neglected a
slight nasal catarrh until It gradually ex-
tended to my throat and bronchial tubes
and finally even mv stomach and liver
became affected, but as I was able to
keep up and do a day's work I let It run
along until my hearing began to fail me
and then I realized that I must get rid
of catarrh or lose my position, as I was
clerk and my hearing was absolutely
necessary.
"Some of my friends recommended an,
inhaler, another a catarrh salve, but they
were no good in my case, nor was any-
thing else until I heard of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and bought a package at
my drugstore. They benefited me from,
the start and ln less than four months I
was completely cured of catarrh, although
I had suffered nearly all my life from it.
"They are pleasant to take and so much
more convenient to use than other catarrh,
remedies that I feel I cannot say enough
In favor of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets."
A little book on c.\use and cure of ca-
tarrh will be mailed free by addressing F.
A. Stuart Co.. Marshall. Mich., and the
tablets are sold by all druggists in the

A resolution providing- for the printing
of additional copies of the' report of the
Taft Philippine Commission was agreed
to. Pettigrew, while not objecting to the
resolution, expressed the. opinion that the
American people were entitled to the facts
with respect to the Philippines. These,
he said, the Taft report did not contain.
It was a partisan report, made by a par.
tisan committee, and he urged that it was
designed to conceal the racts and convey
a false impression to the people of the
situation in the Philippines.
Foraker, chairman of the Committee on
Pacific Islands and Porto Rico, called up

in dollars, half dollars, quarters and
dimes. Against $272,000 of the amount sil
ver certificates had been Issued, the $272.

FOR THE OPEN STAKE
ON Friday, February 22; Saturday,
February 23, and Sunday, Feb
ruary 24. the second great cours
ing stake of the year will be run
at Union Coursing Park. This
will be the California. Plate event, second
only to the John Grace challenge cup.
which was run under the auspices of the
Interstate Coursing Club last October.
Originally the John Grace stake took
place in February and since the change of
dates the California Plate has been sub
stituted for. the former big February
event.
Besides a big purse prize for the winner,
a handsome piece of silver plate, beautiful
in design, with, a coursing scene engraved
upon its face. . will pass into the posses
sion of the lucky owner. In order to
secure the ownership of the plate It must
be won three times. The plate cost up
ward of $200.
Among ' those who . spoke in support of
the President's right to appoint as he had
done were Senators Cockrell and Pettus,
both Democrats, who said that as the
law conferred the discretion of selecting
officers regardless of the rule of seniority,
and. as the selections in this case ap.
peared to have been wisely made, they
could not see their way clear to cast their
votes against his nominations In this par
ticular instance.
Senator Lodge upheld the nominations
He said the criticism of a. man who had
done so much for the country as General
Wood had done at a critical time < was
preposterous.
The explanation was made on behalf of
the President that he especially desired
to reward General "Wood for his services
in Cuba and that he thought his rank
should be high In case he should be called
to discharge other high offices in the fu
ture. . .
No roll call was demanded on the con
firmation of the nominations.
The criticism, of General "Wood was con
fined to the fact that his military record
Is not extended. Senators Bate of Ten
nessee and Jones of Arkansas objected to
the nominations of Generals "Wood. Grant
and Bell on the ground that their nomi
nations constitute a breach of the rule of
seniority In the army and exceptional em
phasis was laid upon General Wood's
nomination on that account. It was held
to be unfair to other officers who had
seen long service in the field. Senator
Pettigrew contended that General Wood
was without practical experience In the
art of war and as a leader of men. He
said the general had gone into the army
as a contract surgeon and had done very
little fighting. If. he said, that sort of
favoritism was to be continued the West
Point academy might as well be abol
ished.
TVASHIXGTOX. Feb. 13.â The Senate
held two executive sessions to-day, with
the result that all the Presidential nomi
nations to the office of brigadier general
were confirmed. The nominations which
caused discussion were those of Generals
Bates, "Wood, Grant and Bell. Senator
Pettigrew criticized General Bates' nomi
nation, because that officer had nego
tiated the Sulu treaty, which treaty he
attacked sharply. Senators Teller and
Rawllns also joined In the criticism' of
the Sulu treaty. They referred especially
to Its recognition of the Institutions of
slavery and polygamy, which, they
claimed, was repugnant to the tastes of
the people of this country, as well as to
the constitution. No one, however, made
objection to General Bates' confirmation
when the time for a vote was reached.

Hammit and the woman left the saloon
after the cutting. Hammit went to his
brother's drug store at Gough and Market
streetB and had his wounded hand at
tended to. He was later arrested by De
tective Crockett on Fourth street. On the
way to the City Prison Hammit tripped
up the detective and attempted to make
his escape, but failed. He claimed that
he was drunk and did not know what he
was doing when he cut Holman. He- gave
the name of Peter Metz when registered
on the detinue book, but later acknowl
edger his true r.ame.
. Attorney Ward of the District Attor
ney's office was sent to take Holman's
ante-mortem statement, but he found it
was unnecessary, as Holman was not in
a dangerous condition. Holman came
from Los Angeles with his wife recently
and two months ago attempted to commit
suicide by swallowing a dose of laudanum
because he had lost his money by gam
bling. Hammit will be charged with as
sault to murder.
Holman was drinking at the bar, when
a woman entered and asked him to give
her a drink, w!th which request he com
plied. Hammit was also standing at the
bar and he and the woman entered into
conversation and then they wont' into a
rear room. A minute later Holman heard
her scream. He pushed, open the door
and asked what was the matter.. Hammit
told him to mind his own business and
with an oath stabbed him in the neck
with a putty knife which he grabbed from
his vest pocket.- severing an artery.
Holman grapipled with him and a des
perate struggle ensued for the possession
of the knife. Boese, the saloon-keeper,
and Fred Craig, an expressman, ran to
Holman's assistance. During the struggle
the knife was broken and Hammit cut his
left hand with It before it was forced from
him by Boese and Craig. By this time
Holman had fainted from loss of blood
and it was thought that his jugular had
been sevored. He was taken to his home
and a physician summoned who found
that an artery, but not the jugular, had
been cut.

at S37A Mission street, was cut in the neck

be rendered to-morrow noon. Sporting
writers from all over the country arrived
to-day and besieged, the quarters of the
light managers, but nobody could make
any definite statement. As soon as Judge
Hollister renders his decision these man
agers will have a conference and will lay
their plans for the future. They promise
to make a statement for the public as
soon as they can in the afternoon. â¢
It is understood that if Judge Hollister
grants the application for a permanent
Injunction the postponement will be for
some weeks, so as to allow time to carry
the case through the Circuit Court and
thence to the Supreme Court.
If Judge Hollister shall refuse an in
junction on the ground that a court of
equity has no Jurisdiction fn such cases
or any other ground the postponement is
not likely to be for more than one week,
and It may be only to the. first of next
week.
While there are reports In circulation
that Governor Nash has three or four
regiments under marching orders, it is not
believed here that any troops will reach
the city this week at least.
All concerned in bringing off the fight
insist that they will not attempt to pro
ceed if a permanent injunction is issued
against them, and the general opinion is
that such will be the finding of the court.

CULL'S RACING FORM CHART
Selde won tbk fifth race, five and a half
furlongs, in a gallop. Courtier and Dan
gerneld. the second and third -.choices;'
came within the money.' but that was all.
Wyoming, a 1-2 favorite in the one mile
event, was farand away ahead of his
field. Fondo and Osmond, at good odds,
got the place and show. _ . -
The steeplechase with Credo and J O C
scratched was a gift for Lothian. Wilson
on Periwig was thrown early in the race,
and all that was left was Lothian and
Lord Chesterfield, Mellocole not counting
and Eva. Moe losing heart, strength and
courage at the stretch.
Favorites- ruled with a high hand yes
terday the first race and the match eyent
excepted. A fair crowd, betting freely,
unloaded on the choices and the books
were punished in several instances. Vas
sal with O'Connor up won at 15-1 In the
first race over six and a half furlongs.
Saintly, the favorite, was too pious for
the Tanforan track and no money was pu
on his plate.
Sister . Jeanie. Jennings' two-year-old,
made the rest of the family appear like
rank outsiders In the three and a half
furlongs race. For a time Minerva, win
some and coy, closed in. but the Sister
was too strong and speedy. Sister Jeanie
was hlKh priced, 7-10 being the best of
fered. Maraschino punched a place in this
race.
Burns rode a clever race and the same
can be said for Sloan. Joe Frey, who at
tached the $1200 purse, proved by this mile
run that he is one of the best, if not the
best, colts now working in California. The
time was 1:42, two seconds slower than
the track record, but the going was pasty.
Articulate was a 7-10 favorite and a block
of money was bet on Joe Frey at 6-5. The
books handled plenty of coin ca the race,
many of them laying "odds against one
horse.
This race, the fourth on the card, was
over the mile route. Tommy Burns pilot
ing Joe Frey. the winner, and Tod Sloan
once more mounted on Articulate. From
post to wire both these Â¦ three-year-olds
hoofed their sticky way in as pretty a
match race as has ever bten seen itt the
Tanforan track. Little time was wasted
at the post. Burns getting away a length,
ahead of Sloan, who seemed anxious to
take the wake at the start. Burns held
the rail throughout the race, and his Judg
ment -of, pace and his careful, sure riding
was superb. Up the back stretch both
horses seemed to skim over the top rail
neck and neck. The crowd in the stand
roared flrsr for one and then for the oth
er, for it was either's race. When the
fast moving oquine.s turned into the
stretch Articulate had the advantage by
a head and it was the only time that
Joe Frey was drum majored. Then came
the finish. Frey. full of strength, game
ness and speed, darted out. Burns seemed
anxious and he looked behind him only
to find Sloan riding easily and cunningly
sure of his race. But this was bravado on
Sloan's part. He knew full well that hiÂ»
mount could not overtake Joe Frey and
he worried Tomniv Burns, who then
started to drive. Both riders lashed their
horses down the stretch and when the
wire was reached the daylight showed a
thin ribbon between Joe Frey and Ar
ticulate.

Tom Ryan's Goal Runner went to the
post favorite over Sir Hampton for the
concluding event, but failed to make it.
Passing Mis-s Rowena in the stretch. Sir
Hampton, with little to spare, stepped in
first by more than a length.
Had a stronger rider than little Brodien
been on the back of Joe Ripley it Is more
than probable Sea Lion, the 1 to 3 favor
ite for the second number, would have
been counted out. As It happened. Sea
Lion took the lead whon half the journey
was over, and ridden out only beat the
old stake horse two lencths. Sixty to one
was laid against Ripley.
Bullman followed the vrin*up by land
ing Victoria S winner of the two-year
old dash. A warm favorite, the Service
filly clipped away at the start, winning
from Pepper Sauce by four lengths. The
winner is owned by ex-Jockey Felix Carr.
Only by vigorous riding, with a dash of
luck tossed in. did Mounce get home a
head before Grand Sachem for the mile
and a sixteenth selling event. Ilullman
on Sachem with the lead allowed Mounce
through next the rail turning into the
stretch, which probably cost the Indian
named horne the race. Flamero closed a
9 to 5 favorite. "Webster finished third on
Loneliness. "
A fair-sized crowd witnessed the racing
at the track across the bay, and the bet
ting assumed much larger proportions
than on .any previous day of the week.
The downfall of rain left the track slow
and inclined to ball up under the horses'
feet. 1- rank K'ell. excellently ridden by
Hullman. defeated a collection of fast
ones for the 51000 Belmont handicap at
odds of <5 to 1. In the other events fa
vorites were four times past the judges
in front. Bullman's work was of the bril-
Uant order throughout, four of the suc
cessful horses reaching the goal with the
California lad in the saddle. Altogether
it v.as a day's sport diiflcult to surpass.
So nicely were the weights on the seven
starters for the handicap adjusted that
Bill Garrett. with 115 pounds up. was fa
vorite, at odds of 2 to 1. The heavy track
militated against the chances of Yellow
tall and True Blue, the odds against both
receding in the ring. Frank Bell's price
drifted from 2 to 6 and he furnished the
surrrise. Outbreaking his field to a pret

At 5:45 the House adjourned.
Bâ â Y the recording yesterday of two
mortgages on property belonging
to the Sutro estate, the heirs
have been forced to recognize In
directly the claims of Mrs. Clara
Kluge, who has contested the Sutro will
because Mr. Sutro disinherited hÂ«r two
children, whose father, she alleses, wa?
the dead millionaire. The two Instruments
were filed In the Recorder's ohice and the
property is mortaged for $476,930 with the
Hibernia Bank.
One of the Instruments bears the name
of the Sutro heirs and the other that of
Mrs. Clara "Kluge-Sutro." The property
involved Includes many outside block*
contiguous to Point Lobos avenue, an^
one of the best pieces of inside prooerty
Included In the mortgage list Is at tho
coner of Battery and Jackson streets.
Some time ago Mrs. Emma L. Merrltt,
as executor of the will, applied to'Judg;
CofCey for leave to mortgage certain real
property of the estate In order to liquidate
pressing Â¦ debts. The application was
granted and Mrs. Merritt applied to thj
Hibernia Bank for a loan of $500,000. Tlie
bank officials agreed to make the loan,
but Insisted that Mrs. Clara "Klusre-Su
tro," who Is contesting Â¦ the will, should
join with Mrs. Merritt and the other helra
in the execution of the mortgage. While
Mrs. Merritt does not recognlzo the
claims of Mrs. Kluge to a share of her
father's estate, she realized that the con
testant was a factor in the litigation )n
which the estate is Involved. It was
therefore necessary to see Mrs. Klug*.
who was not averse to signing the moit
gnges, as It would be an indirect recoi^nl
tlon of her claim on the estate. Ex-Jus
tlce Van R. Paterson, her attorney, met
with Reuben H. Lloyd and other counsel
for the executors, and the mortgages wero
drawn up and signed by the interested
parties.
Ex-Justice Paterson denies that any
compromise has been talked about. He
declares that Mrs. Kluge has a stron?
case and points to the fact that the Hlbe'*
nla Eank declined to take any chances
unless Mrs. Kluge's consent to figuring

SENATORS SPEAK
OF 0T1VAGAIICE
Declare Appropriations Are
Increasing Much Too
Rapidly.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â With the ex
ception of an hour and a half, consumed
in counting the electoral vote and pro
mulgating the result of the Presidential
election, the House devoted to-day to the
sundry civil appropriation bill. General
debate upon this measure was completed,
but little actual progress was made with
tho bill. Fifteen of the 134 pages of the
bill were disposed of.
The sundry civil bill was taken up when
the session opened and Bell of Colorado,
a member of the Appropriations Commit
tee, began a speech on the extravagance
of the present Congress. He said the
people had become alarmed at the rapid
growth of expenditures. So callous had
Congress become to vast increases in the
appropriations, he. said, that it was con
sidered almost disreputable to call atten
tion to the extravagance of the Govern
ment. He produced figures to show that
in a single decade the per capita cost of
carrying on the governmental machinery
had increased from $4 75 to over S10. .
â¢ Cockran of Missouri also made an, at
tack upon the recklessness of the appro
priations in this Congress. He declared
that ,the total for the next year, if reck
oned in gold, would exceed the appropria
tions of 1864, when the Federal Govern
ment had 1200 ships on the sea maintain
ing a blockade from Galveston toÂ» the
Chesapeake and 1,000,000 men on land en
gaged in the most tremendous military
enterprise in the history of the age. Later,
speaking of our policy in the Philippines
and China, Cockran said:
"Talk about progress and Christianity,
if, progress and Christianity mean-march
ing under many flags of plunderers, and
the swords of Christian soldiers, dripping
in the blood of plundered people, it is time
to quit or fling away the masquerade and
say 'Progress has turned freebooter, Chris
tianity slumbers and God is dead.' "
(Democratic applause.)
Cockran also argued that from any
standpoint the "game" in the Philippines
was not worth the cost. "We have al
ready," said he, "spent money enough
there to build the Nicaragua canal, to
construct what new* warships we need,
and we are to-day no nearer peace than
when the first gun was fired."
Richardson of Tennessee also com
mented upon the vast total of appropria
tions at this session, which, he said,
would reach JSOO.000.000. Four years ago,
when President < McKinley' s administra
tion began, the annual appropriations
were about $470,000,000. He conceded that
appropriations would Increase, but whv,
he asked; this prodigious increase of over
three hundred millions. The war had
been over two years and could not be
charged with these increases, for the In
creases were not confined to tho army and
navy appropriation bills. There was an
increase in every one of the appropriation
bills.
"Did you not vote for the river and
harbor and the appropriation bills?" he
was asked.
"What if. I did?" replied Richardson.
"I could not stand here and hold back ap
propriations, for liabilities have been
created."
Moody of Massachusetts challenged
Richardson to point out a single appro
priation in the sundry civil bill that could
be omitted. Richardson said he would
do so.
"While the gentleman Is talking about
cutting down expenses," observed Moody
"I will ask him whether he did not vote
for a soldiers' home in Tennessee?"
Richardsonâ I did. It passed unanimous
ly. I bellevo.
Moodyâ It did not. I voted against It.
Did not the gentleman also vote for the
Bowman act claims?
Richardsonâ I did.
Senator Frye said consent already had
been given to dispense with the rormal
reading of the certificate, but he thought
It mignt be necessary to read the certifi
cate of Arkansas, owing to a slight irreg
ularity. Tills showed that one or the elec-,
tors had been absent and that the Gover
nor had appointed a substitute. The cer
tificate was not challenged, however, and
the tellers proceeded to announce tho re
sult. '
A lapsus linguae by General Grosvenor,
when he announced the vote of Colorado,
created a general outburst of merriment.
Ho announced that Colorado had cast
four votes for William J. Bryan of Ne
braska for President and four for Theo
dore Roosevelt . of . J>Jew i York for Vice
President. " ' "
"Oh, oh, no, shouted Richardson, onÂ©
of the Democratic tellers, while, the mem
bers and spectators joined in the laugh
that followed. Grosvenor corrected the
error. .
. The certificates were not uniform and
the operation of opening the bulky pack
ages and seeking out the result was at
tended with many delays. When Mary
land's eight votes were announced for
McKinley and Roosevelt there was a
sliprht ripple of applause, and the same
response was made to the announcement
of Nebraska's vote. General Grosvenor
announced the vote of the President's
own State, but It created no demonstra
tion. ' . .
Upon the conclusion of the announce
ment of the vote the tellers formally as
certained the totals.
Senator Chandler announced the total
vote cast as 447, of which William Mc-
Kinley -of Ohio received for President 292
and William J. Bryan of Nebraska 155,
and of which Theodore Roosevelt of New
York received for Vice President 292 and
Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois 155. There
upon, In accordance with the statute.
Senator Frye proclaimed the state of
vote as delivered to him. He said: -'-.'
"This announcement of the state of vote
by the President of the Senate is by law
a sufficient demonstration that William
McKinley of Ohio has been elected Presi
dent and that Theodore Roosevelt has
been elected Vice President for the term
beginning March 4, 1901, and will be en
tered together with a list of the votes on
the Journals of . the House and Senate.
The count of electoral votes having been
completed and the. result declared, the
Joint meeting of the two houses is dis
solved and the Senate will now return to
Its chamber."
A tremendous outburst of applause then
swept over the galleries, the Senate filed
out x>f the . hall and * tho r ceremony Â¦ was
ended. i<*UiW*iWw l iiHii'WjwwnMtw>ii*Hf?M
This remark created general laughter.
Thereupon Senator Chandler read in eje
tenso the certificate of the vote of Ala
bama, giving 11 votes for William Jen
nings Bryan of Nebraska for President
and 11. votes for Adlal E. Stevenson of
Illinois for Vice President. When Sena
tor Caffery was about to read the certifi
cate of the State of Arkansas, Senator
Cockrell of Missouri addressed the chair:
"Can we not dispense with the reading
of these certificates," he asked, "and have
simply the result announced? I think we
can trust the tellers."
"The Senate and the House of Repre
sentatives of the United States," he an
nounced, "are In joint session pursuant to
the constitution and laws of the United
States, for opening the certificates and
counting the votes for electors for Presi
dent and Vice President of the United
States. If there Is no objection, tho for
mal portions of the certificates will be
omitted. The certificate of the State of
Alabama will be read by the tellers, who
will make a list of votes therefrom."
At 12:45 proceedings in the House were
suspended and five rows of seats upon the
right of the hall were vacated for the
members of the Senate. At one minute of
1 o'clock Colonel Ramsdell, sergeant at
arms of the Senate, appeared at the main
door opposite the Speaker's desk and an
nounced the President pro tern, and mem
bers of the Senate. The members of the
House rose to receive them, while page,
boys carrying the caskets in which the
electoral returns were deposited took them
to the clerk's desk.
Senator Frye, President pro tern, of the
Senate, ascended the rostrum and took
his place at the right of Speaker Hender
son to preside over the Joint session. Ex-
Vice President Adlal K. Stevenson pre
sided over the joint session when the
electoral vote was counted four years ago.
Immediately below Speaker Henderson
and Senator Frye at the clerk's desk were
the tellers of the two houses. Senators
Chandler of XeW Hampshire and Ca.ffery N
of Louisiana and Representatives Grosve
nor of Ohio and Richardson of Tennessee,
flanked on either hand by the secretary
of the House, Mr. Bennett, and the clerk
of the House, Mr. McDowell. Still below
them on .the floor, the other officers of
the House and Senate ranged themselves
in front of the marble rostrum.
Senator Frye rapped loudly for order
when all were seated. .
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.-The ceremony
of counting the electoral vote for Presi
dent and Vice President cast at the elec
tion last fall took place In the hall ot
the House of Representatives at 1 o'clock
to-day at a joint session of the House and
Senate. The method of counting the vote
is prescribed with great detail by the stat
utes and was followed literally to-day.
Great crowds thronged the galleries to
witness the Interesting spectacle.
The Ceremony Officially Ob

ELECTORAL VOTE
IS CANVASSED
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1901.
5
THE day was when men of prominence
hesitated to give their testimonials to
proprietary medicines for publication.
This remains true to-day of most pro-
prietary medicines. But Peruna has be-
come so justly famous, its merits are
known to so many people of high and low
stations, that no one hesitates to see his
name in print recommending Peruna.
The highest men in our nation have
given Peruna a strong Indorsement. Men
representing all classes and stations are
equally represented.
A dignified representative of the Presby-
terian church, in the person of Rev. E. G.
Smith, does not hesitate to state publicly
that he has used Peruna In his family
and found it cured when other remedies
failed. In this statement the Rev. Smith
is supported by an elder in his church.
Rev. E. G. Smith, pastor of the Presby-
terian Church of Greensboro, Ga., writes:
"Having used Peruna In my family for
some time it gives me pleasure to testify
to Us true worth My little boy 7 years of
age had been suffering for some time with
catarrh of the lower bowels. Other reme-
dies had failed, but after taking two bot-
tles of Peruna the trouble almost entirely
First Presbyterian Church of Greensboro, Ga., and Its Pastor and Elder.
disappeared. For this special malady I
consider it well nigh a specific. As a tonlo
for weak and worn out people it has few
or no equals."â Rev. E. G. Smith.
Mr. M. J. Rossman. a prominent mer-
chant of Greensboro. Ga., and an elder
In the Presbyterian Church of that place,
has used Peruna, and In a recent letter to
the Peruna Medicine Co. of Columbus,
Ohio, writes as follows:
"For a lone time I was troubled with
catarrh of the kidneys and tried many
remedies, all of which gave me no relief.
Peruna was recommended to me by sev-
eral friends, and after using a few bot-
tles I am pleased to say that the Ions
IooKed for relief was found, and I am now
enjoying better health than I have for
years, and can heartily recommend Peru-
na to all similarly afflicted. It is certainly
a grand medicine." â M. J. Rossman.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable advice
gratis.
Address Dr. Hartman, President of tha
Hartman Sanitarium. Columbus. Ohio.

Pure, Sweet,
Delicious.
This is the kind of pastry
that WHITE COTTOLENE
makesâ crusts that melt, bis-
cuits that are "wholesome and
appetizing, everything the best
and most satisfying:. If you have
nevertriedWHITE COTTO-
LENE, you don't know how
much superior a pure vegetable
product, whi : h is odorless, taste-
less and neutral, is to greasy,
impureand unheallhful heg fat.
White
Cottolene
is highly recommended by
prominent physicians every-
where, and is used by exp;rt
cooks and discriminating; house-
wives in preference to :'ll other
cooking fats. You can always
have appetizing and whole-
some food if you use Cottolene.

The Dutch are to engage In a project
as vast aa that of building a Nicargua
canal. It Is-, estimated that It will take
eight years to build the immense dykes
leading to the sea and twenty-four years
more to finish the work, and that, the to-
tal cost will be at least $80,000,000 and more
likely $100,000,000. But as a result 530,000
acres will have been reclaimed, of which
It Is expected that 600,000 acres wUl prove
admirable for agricultural purposes.â

HON. JOHN A. KASSON, Commissioner, plen
ipotentiary for the negotiation of reciprocity
treaties, has recently made an elaborate reply
to certain objections urged by the Home Market Club
against the various treaties he has arranged with
France and with certain West Indian colonies and
South American countries. The paper is the mosr
vigorous defense that has yet been masie on the part
of the Commissioner, but it still falls short of justi
fying his treaties.
The objections expressed in the resolutions of the
Home Market Club are: First, the treaties "are not
based on the true principle of reciprocity, which is the
exchange on favorable terms of dissimilar and non
competing products"; second, they "are based upon
a principle of -free trade which will introduce a dam
aging if not ruinous competition"; third, the treaties
"practically nullify a revenue law which originated, as
the constitution requires, in the House of Represen
tatives, and do not require the co-operation of that
body"; fourth, the treaties "disturb the harmony of
adjustment between industries and will introduce such
inequalities as to unfavorably affect all business."
Mr. Kasson objects to the definition given of the
"true principle of reciprocity." He says such a defini
tion is not; to be found in a dictionary nor in any
precedent o'f legislation. His statement may be true
but nevertheless the majority of the American people
will accept tlfc definition as the correct one. Cer
tainly the people who voted for the party of protec
tion to American industries never intended to fritter
that protection away by treaties that would admit
competing articles to weaken American production.
To do so would be to nullify the whole value of pro
tection. In" fact, Mr. Kasson's policy, if carried out
to its logical conclusion, would result in bringing
about vfrtual free trade, not by action of Congress,
but by diplomacy.
As an illustration of what he has accomplished for
the industries of the country Mr. Kasson cites his
treaty with France, and after pointing out that the
goods of other nations were admitted to the Fre'nch
markets on better terms than ours he says: "After
more than a year's negotiation France finally agreed
to give to us like reductions, averaging from twenty
six to forty-eight per cent of her present duties, on all
the possible exports o! the United States now duti
able save nineteen in number, only a few of these
bein? of importance to the United States. We gave
her in return reductions averaging only 6.8 per cent,
and applicable to about one-fourth of the articles in
our tariff list, reserving (without any concession upon
,lhem) all other articles, including many manufactures
and woolen goods of every kind. If tinder the treaty
Â«ve shall export to France the same percentage of her
imports of goods now subjected to a discriminating
duty wnich we export of other goods now admitted
on equal terms, our annual gain in exports will b-j
from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000."

If the State embarked in such business of course
its mortgages and securities would be non-taxable,
so that an additional burden of taxation would be
shifted upon, the shoulders of individual taxpayers.
It is hard to imagine a plan that would do more
harm than this to individuals and would produce
more maladministration, corruption and loss to the
State.
It seems that the author of the bill was quite per
sistent in trying to get it before the Legisjature and
insisted that it be introduced even though the Senator
who introduced it said he would vote against it. As
it is on file now it should go to the proper commit
tees and be made the subject of an intelligent report,
as the means of educating in right views those who
may now believe that it presents a feasible and work
able system of benefit to the State and people.
The bill probably has its origin in that ignorant
prejudice against banks which is fostered bj- dema
gogues. There are people who think that savings
banks keep all their capital locked up in their vaults,
thus taking it out of circulation and causing a money
famine. Of course the fact is that such banks con
tinually struggle to keep money out of their vaults
and in circulation at the best rate of interest that can
beiud.
The measure is unconstitutional, since there is no
provision for any such function exerrfsed by the State
Treasurer or any other officer. In effect it would be
?.- law to authorize the State to borrow money at 3
per cent and loan it again at current rates. The first
effect xould be injurious to the community of small
depositors in savings banks and the next would be
large losses in the management of such a loan -and
trust business by the State.
As deposits must be in no smaller sums than $2000
it will be seen that the bill proposes to deprive small
depositors of aft savings bank facilities.
The bill provides for a branch of the treasury to be
called the State depository, which shall receive de
posits in suras no smaller than $2000 and pay interest
on the same at the rate of 3 per cent per annum for
ttn years. The money so deposited is to be loaned by
tht State Treasurer on real estate, mortgages and
other securities.
Of course this provision would put an end to such
banks and would at the same time end one of the
greatest inducements to thrift and economy on the
;jart of wage-workers and people engaged in limited
business operations.
This is .to be effected by forbidding that savings
bc:nks shall pay depositors more than one per cent per
annum.
ONE of the most remarkable bills is that intro
duced by Senator Belshaw, by request, to
abolish savings banks and turn the State treas
try into a loan and mortgage institution.

PERSONAL MENTION.
A recent forecast of the outcome predicts that when
the first sign of civil war appears the Russians will at
once enter Austria to support the empire, as was done
when the Hungarian revolt took place. At the same
time the clamors of the German people will force
Germany to send an army into Austria to protect the
German population there. As a result the predic
tion is that Russia will retain the provinces of Gal
licia and Transylvania, while Germany will take Bo
hemia and all the western states of Austria dear
through to the Adriatic Sea, thus obtaining for the
German empire a frontage on the Mediterranean as'
well as on the Baltic. Italy would be forced to con-^
tent herself with a narrow strip to "rectify her fron
tier." Â®iS5
Such is the stupendous outcome expected.- of the
disturbances to follow the death of Francis Joseph.
It will be perceived that the Czech demonstration in
favor of Archduke Ferdinand was something more
than a spectacular performance. It was a distinct case
of playing with fire, and may proVe an important
factor in inflaming the various races to outbreaks
which will end in the dismemberment of their em
pire.
So sure arc the European statesmen that the Aus
trian empire is bound to break up within a few years
that calculations have been already made as to the
division of the spoils. The empire is made up of va
rious races, including Hungarians, Czechs, Germans,
Poles and Croats. These races are held together
solely by the authority of the Emperor. A dispute
over the succession would break the single tie that
holds the empire together. Then would come the
struggle of the Russians, Germans, Italians and Hun
garians to seize the separated provinces and annex
them. France and Great Britain would of course have
no chance to share in the plunder, for they do not bor
der on any part of the Austrian domain, but they
would undoubtedly insist upon having a voice in the
distribution. '<*";
There was a time when Hungary was the weak spot
in the Austrian empire, but that time has passed. The
Hungarian question is now a slight thing in compari
son with that of Bohemia. The population of the
latter kingdom is divided between Germans and
Czechs. The Czechs desire to obtain for Bohemia
something like the home rule that has been granted
to Hungary- The Germans oppose the desire. The
Czechs demand an official recognition of their lan
guage, and again they are met by German opposition.
Thus it will be seen that in Bohemia itself there is a
teething discontent which is kept from breaking out
into war only by the strength of the empire.
In that incident alone there is room for a wrangle
that may result in' the predicted civil war. If the
Czechs refuse to acknowledge and adopt the order of
succession to the crown agreed upon by the Reichs
rath there will be nothing left to do but to fight it
out
DISSENSIONS IN AUSTRIA.
p^A ANY times have the students of international
/ \ politics in Europe predicted that when the
present Emperor of Austria dies there will
be an immediate outbreak of civil war in the empire,
and that as a result the political map of Europe will
be reconstructed. To such predictions something of
confirmation was given by the dispatches from Vienna
announcing that when the Archduke Ferdinand's re
nunciation of the right of succession to the throne was
read in fhe Lower House of the Reichsrath the Cxech
representatives rose in a body, left the House, called
upon the Archduke ahd assured himNhe Czechs do
not recognize the right of the Reichsrath to deal
with matters affecting the succession to the throne of
Bohemia.

The seacoasts of the country, the maritime States,
have supported Government aid to the railways that
penetrated the interior and furnished transcontinental
transportation. Missouri would be without rail con
nection with the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Gulf
of Mexico were it not for the support given to the
aided roads by the maritime States. But such con
siderations have no influence upon Senator Vest,
whose rhetoric is about as useful to his country as a
gimlet is in boring an auger hole.
This suggests the contrast between him and them.
He is sure of his seat as long as he attacks and tries
to injure the business interests of every section but
his own.
His politics is of'the old, narrow, provincial, plan
tation kind that inhered in the institution of slavery,
'.vith an infusion of the modern demagogy that has
come to be the ruling spirit of his party.
He took occasion to compliment the New England
Senators on the care they take of the business inter
ests of their people, and said, truthfully, that as long
?5 they do that they are certain of their seats.
But he is a statesman who knows nothing of the
great industrial and business operations of his coun
try. His constituents think that fishing is an amuse
ment, that it means digging a can of worms, getting
credit for a bottle of whisky and a plug of tobacco
and going out to the creek for a day's fun. He plays
to that sort of an audience, and as long as he can
represent it in the Senate he doesn't care whether
another American ship is launched or not.
Those fishermen follow a most hazardous occupa
tion. If the Senator would go to Gloucester and get
the record of ten years' wreck and loss of life on the
fishing banks of the stormy and foggy North Atlantic
coast he might learn that catching cod and mackerel
is a calling somewhat more strenuous than raising;
hogs in Missouri.
The salt drawback for benefit of the fishermen i9
put forward as if jt were the only drawback provided
in the tariff. If Senator Vest will visit Kansas City,
St. Louis and other manufacturing and industrial cen
ters in his State he will find his own constituents get
ting drawbacks on tin, on glycerine, sugar, alcohol
and a number of other articles to an amount enor
mously in^excess of that given to the fishermen of
New England.
The five States whose transportation interests de
pend on the river, and whose best agriculture must
be protected against it, get in every Congress more
than the entire annual subsidy that will be paid to
the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts for the restora
tion of an American merchant marine. About twice
as much of the river appropriation is spent in Mis
souri as all Neiy England will get out of the ship
subsidy. Yet Senator Vest draws a picture, plaintive
and pitiful, of the Missouri farmer distressing himself
to pay a subsidy to greedy New England!
Talk of that kind is called statesmanship in certain
precincts in Pike-County. But Senator Vest forget,
that when his State, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi
and Louisiana ask in every river and harbor bill for
from eight to fifteen millions of dollars to be spent
within their borders in improving the navigability and
restraining the floods of the Mississippi River no
New England Senator objects or calls attention to the
fact that the river does not run into Cape Cod Bay
and is therefore unworthy of an appropriation.
Among other fault-finding he made a bitter attack
on the New England fishermen because they arc per
mitted by law to have a drawback of duty on the salt
usÂ«d in curing fish. He regarded this as a great offense
to the West, and when it was added to the fact that
New England would build ships under the proposed
law the accumulation of offenses was nearly enough to
justify Missouri in seceding from the Union.
IN his speech in opposition to a revival of American
shipping Senator Vest of Missouri" charged that
the shipping bill would benefit New England more
than it would the West or the Mississippi Valley, and
made an attack upon the New England Senators for
their support of the measure.

Opening of Parliament.
The new King of England is catering 1
manifestly to the popular taste. London
people require more court gayety. as that
brings money into the coffers of the trades
men. The King has determined that Par
liament shall be opened on February 14
with the most impressive ceremonials.
The magnificent state carriage, which has
not been used since the death of Prince
Albert, forty years ago. has been hauled
out from its hiding place for complete re
pairs. It is to be so renovated as to bÂ«
more brilliant than ever, with gold orna
mentation and plate glass and with ex
pensive frescoes on its panels. It is fur
ther understood that Queen Alexandra
will accompany the King to the Parlia
ment House, and we believe that this
is the first time in a hundred years of
such an occurrence. The Peeresses arÂ«
expected to be present and the offlcial3
and Peers in their robes of state. The
Peeresses are not allowed to wear any
Jewelry. Edward Rex knows that the
people want a grand show on every state
occasion and he is shrewd enough to
cater to that taste. In this respect Vic

The Nation Hysteria.
Has the coming woman come into thÂ«
new century Â¦with a hatchet? Has she
abandoned moral suasion and will she se
cure reforms by smashing thinsrs? These
are questrbns which must shortly be con
sidered seriously. The hysteria which so
suddenly seized Mrs. Carrie Xation ap
pears to be spreading -lowly but surely.
The source of the affliction is still in Kan
sas, but sporadic cases have manifested
themselves in widely separated localities.
The saloon, or the ."Joint." as Mrs. Na
tion prefers to call it. is not the .only ag
gravating cause of this hysteria- In Chi
cago the drug store has produced quite a
violent attack ot it. and eminently peace
able and well-disposed dealers in pills and
potions now look askance at every bevy
of women entering their stores, to dis
cover whether they are bringing prescrip
tions or hatchets. Having spread from
saloons to drug stores, the engrossing
question now is. in what other directions
this hysteria will spread before its force

KANSAS PROHIBITIONâ F. "W. A.,
City. The prohibition law of Kansas is
a constitutional provision, which is as
follows: "The manufacture and sale of
intoxicating liquor shall be forever pro
hibited in the State except for medicinal,
scientific and mechanical purposes."
There is no such offense known to the law
as "joint smashing." That is the local
name given in Kansas to the acts of Mrs
Carrie Nation and her followers because
they Joined together to smash things.
ASHES OF TOBACCOâ T. F. J., City.
The popular theory that the ashes of a
cigar or of a cigarette introduced into a
beverage, such as beer or whisky, to be
drunk by an Individual partially intoxi
cated, will produce increased Intoxication
or produce narcotism is at fault. It Is the
nicotine of tobacco that Is introduced In
the drinks to produce the effects named.
Those who wish to produce such an effect
usually dose the liquor with snuff.
The greater part of the ash of tobacco
consists of insoluble salts, principally car
bonate of -lime. The soluble consists prin
cipally of potash salts, which amounts to
from 5 to 35 per cent.
A NOTEâ C. R., Wcstside. Cal. Unless
there Is 'a stipulation to that effect the
u'ncollected Interest on a note Is not added
to the principal. In. this State it has been
decided that if by the terms of the note
interest is due and payable every six
months the payee li not entitled, under
the statutes of this State, to Interest upon
interest, if the installment of interest is
not paid as it fall.* due, unless there is
an express provision in writing to pay
such interest. The maker of a note can
not be compelled to renew a note. The
remedy is to commence an action. The
law of California on the subject of com
pound interest is as follows: "The parties
may in any contract In writing whereby
any debt is secured to be paid, agree that
if the interest on such debt is not punctu
ally paid it shall become a part of the
principal, and thereafter bear the same
rate of interest as the principal debt."

PAUL REVERE IN KANSAS.
The greaumass of protectionists will hold that the
Home Market Club is right. True reciprocity is the
exchange on favorable terms of- non-competing
products, and true protection is the protection of all
the industries of the American people.
Why should the wine, the fruit, the sugar and other
industries made subject to loss by the Kasson treaties
be called "extremely petty in themselves"? And, even
if they were petty, why are they 'not as justly entitled
to protection as the bigger industries of the country?
The Boston Transcript in commending Mr. Kas
son's defense says: '"There are a few industries, ex
tremely petty in themselves as compared with the gen
eral benefits set off against them, that are afraid they
would suffer, and in consideration of them we are to
forego the advantage of putting ourselves on a level
with the most favored nations in our trade relations
with that great country. This is not protecting home
industries. ' It is simply lugging a few of them bodily,
while others more numerous and quite as important
sweat and suffer in consequence." â¢*
posed to competition for the sake of profiting other
industries? The "true principle of protection means
equal protection to sail American' industries. It does
not mean that some shall be sacrificed to others. -

Lake Shore Tramc Manager
Talks of Recent South
ern Pacific Deal.
Captain G. F. Grammer, general traffic
manager of the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern and the Lake Brie and Western
railroads, arrived In San Francisco yes
terday and is a guest at the Palace. HÂ©
expressed himself very plainly with refer
ence to the railroad situation in Califor
nia and declared that the deal whereby
tho Harriman-Vanderbilt syndicate se
cured control of the Southern Pacific waa
bound to be of great benefit to this State.
"The VanderbTrts took hold of the roarts
I represent several years ago," he said,
"and since that time they have run on a
model plan. I do not think that the new
deal will result in any .change in the per
sonality of the staff just at present. I do
think, though, that some day there might
bÂ« a president appointed for both roads
who would represent the two companies
In New York.
"Consolidation does not mean that the
number of men employed by the railroad
companies shall be cut down. Three "ears
ago in the East there was. a consolidation
of fast freight lines, but tills did not cut
down the number of men employed.
"The general opinion in the East is that
the Harriman syndicate in buying the
Southern Pacific stock did It as a result of
a carefully considered scheme. It waa not
done hastily,, but had been planned for
perhaps a year or more. With the own
ership of the XJnion Pacific and the South
ern Pacific in .the same hands there will
be a harmonious feeling, no cutting of
rates and better times for California." '

COOPER TALKS
OF OIL SIGNS
Indications of Petroleum
Defined by the State
Mineralogist.
Predicts That Some One Who Has
Nerve and Luck Will Secure
Great Flow Near
. Stockton.
"One of the most remarkable regions In
all California," said State Mineralogist
Cooper, yesterday, "is a tract of four
square miles, about eight miles northwest
of Orland. ; Wherever the soil Is pene
trated to any depth out rushes a volume
of gas, which has Its origin in petroleum.
Sink a post hole and gas manifests itself.
Water wells continually are giving evi
dence of the presence of gasâ In fact, a
man who was digging a well struck gas at
a depth of thirty feet and was blown up
with it. much to his surprise."
The State' Mineralogist recently had
business In Tehama County, and went to
see the tract. He explored it carefully
and so fixed the general limits by the
manifestations of gas.
Mr. Cooper said that the gas certainly
did not come from decayed vegetation. It
was not a marsh gas: in other words, it
showed that somewhere there was a large
deposit of petroleum, but he would not
venture to make any prediction concern-
Ing the exact locality of the oil. It might
be near and it might be twenty miles dis
tant. A queer feature is the nature of the
flow. For awhile it manifests itself at Â¦.all
points over the entire area, wherever
there is a water well or post hole or other
excavation in the ground. Then this is
succeeded by suction, during which the
air is drawn inward. After a time this Is
reversed. At all points tfle will light. Mtr.
Cooper satisfied himself by tests that the
gas was not frona decayed vegetation.
As the prospectors for oil are watching
for gas as an Indication of petroleum, and
as they are now abroad in a majority of
the counties of thÂ« State, it will not be
amiss to repeat some of Mr. Cooper's ob
servations:
"Frequently eases," says Mr. Cooper,
"are seen to ascend from the bottom of
streams and pools of water. In the bed
of La Brea Creek, upon the Slsauoc
rancho, Santa Barbara County, gases rise
from the bottom of thÂ«a creek, for a dis
tance exceeding: one mile. Gases can be
lighted upon the surface of the water and
they burn with a luminous flame. This
occurs In many other places in California.
Carbureted hydrogen, or natural icas. is
a far greater indication of the presence of
the bitumens than is the sulphureted hy
drogen or carbonic acid gas. Consequent
ly it Js frequently important to determine
between these gases. Carbureted hyd>o
gc.n burns with a yellow, "luminous name,
whereas sulphureted hydrogen burns
with a bluish flame. A familiar example
of the color of these flames is shown in
the burning of an ordinary match. LJght
the match, and while the sulphur Is burn
ing a bluish flame is shown. When the
sulphur is consumed and the wood alone
burns a luminous^ yellow flame is shown.
Sulphureted hydrogen has a strong odor
of sulphur and when a brightened piece
of silver is held In it the silver becomes
blackened. Carbonic acid gas does not
burn."
Mr. Cooper is of the opinion that there
are rich deposits of petroleum about
Stockton. The large flaw of jras and a
knowledge of its elements convinced him
of the accuracy of this supposition. He Is
satisfied that the Stockton gas is from pe
troleum. "If some one has only the nerve
to hunt for petroleum near Stockton and
has good luck also he will probably reveal
another great California petroleum field."
The announcement that the Southern
Pacific Company will make chanpres In its
locomotives on 2000 miies of roa<i to nt
them to burn petroleum, instead of coal,
is pood news to the oil producers for two
reasons. One is that it Insures a steady
demand for a large amount of oil fuel for
an Indefinite period. The other and not
leas Import-ant is that it pives the Indorse
ment of a great corporation to the excel
lent and ample supplv of the liquid fuel.
An attempt is also being made for the in
troduction of Callforniapetroleum Into tha
Hawaiian Islands. W. S. Miller. Pacific
Coast manager of the Standard Oil Com
pany, will see what can be donÂ« in that
field. If the Hawalians take kindly to the
fuel it is proposed to run a tank steamer
to carry 35.000 barrels of oil.

Matter's Big Distillery at
Antioch Held Up by
Uncle Sam.
Federal Agents Charge That One
Thousand Barrels of Black Strap
Were Handled There Con
trary to Law.
Special Internal Revenue Agent Burt
M. Thomas discovered several days ag^t
that the fruit brandy distillery of the Cal
ifornia Distilling Company at Antioch had
received 1000 barrels of black molasses
within the last few months. Molassea 1Â»
one of the articles that fruit distilleries
are forbidden to distil, and the penalty for
using it or other prohibited substance la
confiscation of the entire distillery and
product.
Deputy McCabe was detailed to Investi
gate the" matter, and he secured proof that
the above mentioned quantity of "black
strap" had been received at the distillery
and that the greater part of it had disap
peared. An examination of the books of
the distillery was at once instituted under
the direction of Internal Revenue Collec
tor John C. Lynch, and two of the em
ployes, George Weeks and George Tomp
kins, were subpenaed to appear yesterday
to be interrogated regarding the affairs of
the distillery.
In the absence of Collector Lynch his
chief deputy, Robert Frick, conducted the
examination.
The witnesses made no objection anil
were about to begin testifying, when
George H. Matter, president of the distil
lery, appeared with two attorneys, and
protested against the witnesses being in
terrogated unless in nis presence and that
of his attorneys and a stenographer. Dep
uty Krlck ruled that he had the authority
tocxclude any persons he pleased, whera
upon Mr. Malter and the attorneys ad
vised Weeks and Tompklns to refuse to
answer any questions.
Mr. Frick thereupon swore to a com
plaint against the witnesses charging
them with contempt of court, as providni
in the revenue Jaws, but it was too late
In the day to have an attachment Issued
against the defendants, and further pro
ceedings were deferred until to-day.
Mr, Malter owns a vineyard and distil
lery, the Maltermoro, near the citv of
Fresno. The distillery at Antioch is one
of the most extensive and valuable fruit
brandy plants in, the State. Should It !>e
established that he has distllleu the "black
strap" the product, even In ti.e hands of
in^cent purchasers, is liable to seizure
ami confiscation.
In Tchama County. Some months apo tlie
Tehama County Oil Company was organ
ized, naming Red Bluff as its place of
business. Now another company has been
formed to be known as the Tehama Com
pany, with headquarters at Corning. The
last named company is composed of Sac
ramento men, who will work west of
Corning. -Â¦
The Hanford Sentinel says of the pro
posed oil exchange for that city:
There is a proposition on foot among the
oil men of the town, as well as several other
local parties, to oreanlze and conduct an- oil
exchange In Hantord. A. Rubensteln has
taken the matter in hand and has interviewed
several of the prominent business men of the
town In reTarii to the matter, and all appear
to be thoi^JKhly in favor of the proposition.
The object is to organize the local exchange
and place it- among the other exchanges in
the country, po that the oil fields of this Im
mediate section, which arc, up to the present
time, free .from the boom which has taken
hold of the Kern River district, will bÂ« made
more v/ldely known. The exchange will organ
ize with a limited membership probably forty
or fifty members, and to whom seats will be
sold that they may participate In the meetings.
Brokers will be allowed to take charge of the
buying and Felling of stocks during the dally
sessions of the exchange. The stocks of the
local companies and fields will probably be
allowed to be placed in the exchange free of
charge, but outside companies will be charged
an entrace fee. The proposition is to nt up
a room somewhere In town. . where the ex
change will hold dally sessions and by which
the Coallnsa oil fields will become better
known.
Humboldt County papers report the oil
excitement to be on in that county in sev
eral localities. Mendocino County, ac
cording to the Uklah Dispatch, Is also
stirred up. The Dispatch says that there
are good Indications of oil at Point Arena,
Mendocino City and Long Valley.
ReferrinR to the investments In oil
stocks In the interior counties the Vaca
ville Reporter says:
The purchase of oil stocks has jrone to such
an extent that It is making: a tight money
market In Vacaville. We are of the opinion
that not less than $40,000 of Vacaville money
has already been put into oil stocks. The
probabilities are that before the first six
months of this year are out Vacaville will
have put 1100.000 cash into oil stocks.
A water well on the place of W. A.
Perrin is reported by tho Bakersfleld Cali
fornian to be performing queerly. The
well is 140 feet deep, so says the Califor
nian It furnished water for domestic
purposes until this year, when it began
to emit large quantities of natural gas
and the water was made unlit for use, so
the well was abandoned. The well was
capped, but the gas continues to now.
This is about four miles west of a well
which is down 1200 feet, but In which no
oil has been struck. â¢
The January business on the Los An
geles Stock Exchange beat all previous
records by $56,000. , This is considered to
bo remarkable, because of the fact that,
beginning with January 1, the sale of un
listed stocks on the floor was forbidden.
There is quite a boom in the Newhall
district in a development way. Within a
very short period fifty new derricks have
been put up and various strikes have been
reported in the field.
The Baltimore American. has a long ar
ticle In which the prediction is made that
California will soon take the leading place
among the States of the Union in the pro
duction of petroleum.
Pipe to' carry the water for the Valley
Water 'Company up the hills into the
Coalir.ga field has been received at Coal
inga. The water company has its ma
chinerv ordered and will soon begin work.
The first water well- Is being bored, north
of Coallnza. "
Four wells have been located on the
Watson ranch in San Benito County.
There Is a seepage of oil on this ranch.
A franchise has been asked from the
Supervisors of Kern County for the erec
tion by â¢ the Sunset Electric LJght and
Power Company of poles and wires along
the county roads. The petition sets forth
that the company proposes to erect plants
for the development for the Sunset, Mc-
Kittrlck and Kern River districts of light
and power.
Drilling has begun near Chico.
Lands have been taken up on the north
side of Rod Slide Mountain, eighteen
miles northwest of Guerneville, for oil ex
ploitation. OH se>paj?es have been found
In that section for some years. A com
pany haa been organized. The Guerne
ville X-Rays says in event of oil being
struck In paying quantities about seven
miles of pipe line would connect tanks on
Coal Oil Creek with the railroad station
at Cazadero, and sixteen miles would lay
It down at. Guerneville station.
Some parties In the southern counties
are forming oil companies to take up and
exploit oil lands In Texas.
A second company of Santa Cruz In
vestors has been formed to operate on a
tract of 200 acres In Kern County.
The Olympic Athletic Club will soon put
!n two immense tanks for petroleum and
will substitute oil for coal as fuel.

Famous Method Free to All.
Dr. W. 55. Rice. 418 W. Main et., Adams, X.
T., will send free to any one who is ruptured
or knows of any person ruptured, whether a
man, woman or child, a free trial of his fa-

curing cases that defied hospitals, doctors.
trusses, electricity and all else. Merely send
your name and addres? and the free trial will
be sent without any cost to you whatever.
R. W. Yourex, a well-known commercial trav-
eler, was ruptured ten years, tried every truss
on )hÂ» market, partly made up his mind to
undergo the danger oi an operation, when by
the (?rcateÂ»t of good luck he tried the Dr. Rice
method. He Is now cured.
Mr. Yourex says: "I tried Dr. Rice's method
and It cured me. I did not lpse a day on the
road. Hundreds of merchants and friends In
Illinois. Wisconsin. Minnesota and Iowa know
the wonderful fact that this remarkable
method cured me and I certainly feel thankful
enough to tell other ruptured people how they
may profit by my experience." Mr. Yourex
lives tn Cedar Rapids. Iowa, at 222^ First
8venue.
Every ruptured person ought to send at once
and make a trial of this method that cures
without pain, danger, operation or an hour's
loss of time. Begin now and In a short time
you will never know you had been ruptured.

NEW TORK. Feb. 13.â Speculative liquida
tion w^s the order of the day on the stock
market and toward the <;lose of the day the
relling became urgent In some of the stocks
which have been highly manipulated In the
progress of the extended advance. The de
pletion of margins and the uncovering of stop-
Joes orders were evidently responsible for some
of the heavy offerings of stock which were
tumbled upon the market in growing volume
Â£Â« the decline in prices proceeded. Generally
epeaking there was a feeling in speculative
circles that "the good news was all out," to
ute a favorite Wall btreet phrase. The fact
that the day's news did not bring any an
nouncement of a new gigantic combination In
prctpect or in course st achievement probably
had much to do with this feeling. The highly
Feaeoned fare to which the Wall street palate
haj; betn accustomed leaves the speculation

s. financial consolidation running up Into the .
millions. The disinclination to look for further
Important development in the immediate fu
ture wan emph&fiized by the current reports
of contemplated winter vacation trips by sev
eral cf the capitalists who have been foremost
figures In* the treat financial projects which
have recently dazzled the speculative world.
There has been daily and even hourly ex
j.f.'tfiti'.ii that the details of the financial plan
jor effecting a merger of the steel combina
tions would be officially given to the public.
The delay in giving out this Information has
been trying to the nerves of eome of the spec
ulators long of the rteel stocks and they
tought relief to-day niore than on previous
occatfons since the projected merger deal be
came known by unloading their holdlncs. The
repeated rebuffs which the bears have received
have made them very timid and there was
not much evidence of a demand to cover short
accounts even at considerable declines. There
was undoubtedly large short Belling, however,
!'Â»-day in the belief that an extended period of
reaction had been fairly inaugurated; a belief
which has been indulged In many times before
in thÂ«> course of the recent extraordinary mar
ket. The course or affairs in the money mar
ket p&ve substantial ground for apprehension
on the part of speculator* depending on loans
for carrying: their holdings. It is evident that
the recent enormous extension of credits for
financial railroad combinations has much cur
tailed the future reso-.u-ces of the money mar
ket. The reflux of funds from circulation is
distinctly In* with tne growing activity of
business requirements Incident to the wiring
trade. The absence of American subscriptions
of any Important volume to the new British
loen exciu* comment. It Is due in part to
tire c-oier conditions of the foreign money
market, which remit at present is unattractive
to American Investor*, but there can be no
doubt that the narrowed surplus resources of
the New York market also had to do with pre
venting American bids for the loan. London
was a large speculative buyer Of stocks here
this morning, especially of Atchison and Nor
folk and Wtetern. but the heavy profit-taking
overcame the London buying and ewept nearly
everything in the market below the Monday
level. Western Cnlon and St. Louie and San

acute weakness v.-es shewn by Sugar, Missouri

CHICAGO. Feb. 13.â Following the opening
depression, v.-hlch seemed In perfect consonance
with the news nnd statistics of the day, the
wheat market behaved in arTextremely bullish
manner. Speculation students paired off the
Continental strength against Liverpool's fail
ure to resoond to advances on thN
side and laid the rest to a covering
movement. May wheat opened at 75@75 ! /bC
Commission-houses bought on a fairly liberal
scale, meanwhile selling July, which sold at
a discount of l%c under May. At the advance
local shorts came Into the market and In bid
ding for tightly held wheat sent the price up
to 75*i?J75 7 /(ic. In this rally sympathy with the
corn .market was influential, but the world's
visible showed an Increase of 1.700,000 bushels
tnd occasioned pelling from both bulls and
bears, nnder which the market reacted to
75%ii775>ic. Again inquiry was renewed only
to find t*m iittle was for sile. May was
forced sharply to 7Gc and the close was strong,
%c over Monday, at T5' 7 /iiQ76c.
Corn paid some deference to the opening
wheat easlnr-ss. May closed %c down at 33%c.
Tho market eared oiT on realizing sales.
Oats were dull and fpatureless, with the
>-trade nearly all local. May closed unchanged
at 2;.%c.
Provisions ruled dull but steady, trade being
confined to local Interests. The opening was
a shade easier because of heavy hog receipts
and lower prices at the yards, but the market
steadied later in sympathy with the grain mar
kets. May pork closed unchanged, lard 2>4c
higher, ribs unchanged.

NEW YORK. Feb, 13. -The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London cablegram says: The stock
market here showed brisk trading to-day with
a very cheerful tone. With this went the ex
pression or rather vague anticipations of some
sort of favorable announcement in the King's
speech to-morrow, but so far as I could learn
It apparently was- only a case of the wish
fathering the thought. The American demand
was much busier again. In the early hours
prices were strong, on the demand for Atchl
son and Reading issues, but a lot of selling
orders from New York fell like a wet blanket
on the market, causing a dull close. There
Is a very sharp demand for money, the bank
having complete control of the market. Call
money ranged from 4 to 7 per cent; time loans
4 per cent, whila the bank loaned largely at
5 per cent.

BOSTON, Feb. 13â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say of the wool trade to
morrow: The market has shown considerable
activity and there has been a good sized out
ward movement of the staple, which is re
flected In the record of shipments, which ag
gregate over 4,000,000 pounds, and the sales,*- so
far as can -be learned, we estimate at
over four and a half million' pounds. The
business of , the past .week has been largely
In territories, of which some good sized lines
have been moved by several houses, the esti
mated saleB of these wools being about two
million pounds. A good demand Is also noted
for fine unwashed and medium fleeces. The
tone of the market as far as prices are con
cerned, has been Irregular and unsettled, the
tendency of the whole in favor of the buyer,
although prices are no lower as a whole than
they were the first week. There is reported
to have been some weakening in the West In
certain quarters, but holders as a rule are
still nrm and are talking much higher prices
than those which rule at the seaboard. The
sales for the week In Boston amounted to
4. 2S1.8CO pounds domestic and 355.000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 4,630.800 pounds,
against a total of 3,933,400 pounds for the pre
vious week.

the State Department contain nothing to
confirm the statement emanating- from
Toronto to the effect that Secretary Hay
has /protested against tho dispatch of
Charles Lan seller from Canada to Lon
don and St. Petersburg in the prosecution
of the Canadian Â¦ search for evidence to
sustain its contention relative to the con
tested boundary line between Canada and
Alaska.
As to the further statement that the
high joint commission is still alive and
subject to reconventlon to' consider this
boundary question, it is said that this la
a question to be determined at the pleas
ure of either government, the United
States or Great Britain. The rock upon
â¢which the ' commission split is well de
fined in the diplomatic charts, and when
ever one side or the other is prepared to
consent to the removal of the obstacle
there probably would be no objection to
recalling the commission to life, in order
that any important and still open issues
between the, United States and Canada
outside of this boundary question could be
finally settled.

started is a mystery, but it is supposed to
have resulted from a defective flue. But
little furniture was saved. The loss on
the house was $12,000, with about $7000 in
surance. ::;,:â¢Â¦â¢

The building up of the credit was. ac
cording to the police theory, only a part
of the general plan Wilson had In view
for handsomely mulcting his victim, the
Alamtda Land Company. But there was
a slip in the plan. Wilson had announced
that he was a capitalist from Bisbee,
Ariz. The Land Company people decided
to make some inquiry before closing the
transaction anC wired to Bisbee. Tha re
ply came that their customer was un
known. Then they called in the police.
Edson was prompt with an identifica
tion. Davidson's record, as uncovered
since his arrest, shows that he spent a
year and a half behind the walla of San
Quentin Penitentiary because he was too
careless in handling forged checks.
Such was J. "\V. Davidson's explanation
to-day to Police Judge Smith, before
whom Davidson's examination on a
charge of swindling J. H. Edson, an oil
promoter, was held. The court could not
consider the plea as a. legitimate excuse,
however true It might have been, and the
prisoner was remanded for trial before
the Superior Court in bail of $2000.
Davidson, under the name of A. W. Wil
son, started an elaborate rtnancl.il scheme,
which promised to yield good results.
Flr3t, he induced Edson to indorse a
check for $100, upon which was paid $50
in gold and a certificate of deposit for the
remainder. With that stock in trade Wil
son -went to Alameda, where he negoti
ated the purchase of a $4500 house from
the Alameda Land Company, presenting
a $1500 check in part payment. At A.
Kist's store Davidson bought a big bill
of goods, furnishings for the new resi
dence. He paid the furniture man the $00
certificate on account.

Rastus was thinking of the oranges. "I

Heroic Colored Boy Is Maitmd While Trying to
Prevent a Runaway, but Will Recover.
Mr. Kafson regards the Secretary's ac
tion as most conciliatory and as the only
course, leading to a final settlement, and
he hopes that Russia will see It in that
light and will await the determination of
the courts. He pointed out that It is much
to the interest of Russia to secure a final
determination. The chances are equal
that the decision will be In favor of Rus
sia. It would be most unfortunate if
Russia should not consider this action in
a friendly spirit, but it Is so intended on
the part of the United States.
Russia has a regular tariff schedule but
by commercial treaties reduced rates are
granted certain countries. Although we
have no reciprocity treaty with Russia,
she has given us the benefit of the reduced
rates and the gTOwth of our exports to
? Russia has been rapid. Under such clr
umstances It would be unfortunate if at
this time Russia suspended the lower
rates and placed the higher rates against
our goods. It would, Mr. Kasson said
operate especially against American com
merce.
Reciprocity Commissioner Kasson was
asked to-day as to the current reports
that a commercial war between Russia
and the United States might be precipi
tated by the determination of this Gov
ernment to collect a sum equal to the
bounty on exports of Russian sugar. Aa
the President's plenipotentiary Mr. Kas
pon has had charge of the negotiations
with foreign governments relative to the
reciprocity treaties. The payment of a
sugar bounty by Russia has been one of
the questions arising in the course of the
negotiations. Mr. Kasson said the object
of Mr. Gago was to secure a. final ruling
on the matter, which would determine
the policy.
The one event that might change the
situation in a manner to wipe out the
issue is a decision by the United States
courts to the effect that the Russian su
gar is not bounty added, and it is stated
that every opportunity will be afforded
by the treasury officers for the speediest
possible determination of that question
through a test case upon the first Impor
tation of Russian sugar.
Inquiry at the departments named
shows that the Secretary of the Treasury
took this etep, as aet out In his letter yes
terday, with great reluctance and only
after the most patient investigation Into
the merits of the case. It was fully real
ized that the result of the decision to im
pose the differential duty would injurious
ly affect the American trade in agricul
tural implements, machinery, railway ma
terial and rolling stock and. of the other
great staples of export to Russia. But It
appeared that there was no way out of
it if the law was to be enforced, and the
Secretary was obliged to negative the
Russian contention that the Russian Gov
ernment actUiUly paid no bounty on ex
port sugar, such as would subject it to
the United States countervailing duty.
Attorney General Griggs, however, decid
ed that the Russian Government practi
cally paid a bounty on export sugar and
Secretary Gage was obliged to Instruct
the treasury officials to collect an addi
tional duty on Russian sugar amounting
to the bounty, which is calculated at a
little less than 1 cent per pound. The
Russian Government has given notice
that if the attempt is made by the United
States to lay this countervailing duty it
must respond by imposing the maximum
tariff rates upon American exports to
Russia. We are now enjoying the mini
mirm rate and in very many cases the
maximum would be absolutely prohibitive
on American exports to Russia.
It is said at the State Department that
this is the situation to-day, and that all
that can be done Is to wait for the next
move on the part of Russia.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â The State De
partment ar.d the Treaiury Department
are being deluged with telegrams from
vast business Interests protesting against
the imposition of the countervailing duty
on sugar imported from Russia. Nearly
all of the correspondents urge that such
action on the part of the United States
will prove ruinous to our export trade
with Russia, which already has attained
large proportions*, with promise of an in
crease in the future as the Siberian Rail
road and new trans-Pacific steamship
lines are opened up.

moned Sunday to a police station and
were there arrested and immediately tried
summarily by a court under the presi
dency of Carlo Zenin of the St. Peters
burg Educational District. They denied
having been engaged in the forcible ob
struction of university work, but de
manded the annullment of the penalties
against the St. Petersburg and Keiff stu
dents. They admitted they were leaders
of a peaceful strike, which would last un
til their demands were fullllled. They
â¢will probably receive the- martyrs* crown
in the form of military service. Seven
other students were summoned before the
political police and warned that they
would be arrested if they approached the
university buildings. Of the students
condemned to military service, 1S3 have
departed for various cantonments, the
farthest being Trans-Caucasia, There is

MISS LYLLYN RUGGLES is to
wed Lee Dowllng Mathias, a
young attorney of Chicago. The
engagement of the young
couple is the concluding chap
ter J of a pretty romance that opened in
London last summer. '
Miss Ruggles spent her summer abroad.
So did Mr. Mathias. It was a case of love
at first sight with the young man from
Chicago, and when Miss Ruggles returned
to America, so did the attorney from the
Windy City. Mr. Mathias spent the
Christmas week In this city, and then the
pretty chapter was written that will make
the wedding bells ring out in' Easter week.
Miss Ruggles is the daughter of A. B.
Ruggles, the vice president of the San
Francisco Stock Exchange. She is beau
tiful and accomplished. She was edu
cated in this city and has enjoyed the ad
vantages of an extended visit abroad.
Mr. Mathias, the fortunate man, is a
young and prosperous attorney and a
member of the law firm of Aldrich,
Mathiae & Phlpps of Chicago.
No date has yet been set for the wed
ding, although it is probable that It will
be celebrated during Easter week. It Is
to be a home affair and will be solemnized
at the residence of the bride's parents at
812 Post street.
The wedding of Miss Georgine Pestner
and Le Roy Bean was solemnized yester
day at noon at the residence of tho bride's
The home was beautifully decorated for
the occasion with orange boughs heavily
laden with golden fruit. In a bower of
ferns, with a bowknot of orange blos
soms overhead, the young couple stood
during the ceremony. The bride wore an
exquisite dress of white organdie over
white silk. Her attendants were gowned
alike in point d'esprlt over white silk.
Mr. and Mrs. Bean left last evening for
a bridal trip, keeping their destination a
secret. Their future home will be in Sac

"It is pitiful to see tho little one try to

mother to-day. ''She tries hard to think
what brought her to her present condi

FOR HIS BRIDE DURING EASTER WEEK.
Little Christine Turner Is Picked Up Unconscious in Alameda and
Cannot Recall How She Was Rendered Insensible.
When Christine was found her bicycle
Â¦was also found at a short distance from
her. She may have received a bad fall
from the wheel, but tho nature of the
wounds on her head indicate that some
thing besides concussion with the pave
:nent was the cause. On each Fide of the
bead there are serious abrasions, though
no fractures. One of these may have
been caused by contact with the pave
ment, but the other is undoubtedly the
result of a heavy blow. The < theory is
that the child was run Into by a. horse-
But the strange part of the child's mis
hap is that she is unable to throw any
light upon the cause, though In her lucid
moments she has conversed freely upon
all other FUbjects. Whether s*he fell
from her bicycle or was struck by a car
or a horse or a vchirj.? she cannot pay.
Phe makp? painful efforts to recollect, but
fails altogether to bring back memory.
When the ch'Ad was laid on a lounge she
regained consciousness for a moment,
just long enough to ask her mother what
had happened. Th^n phe lapsed Into a
comatose state, from which she did not
recover for twelve hours. Since Thurs
day ChriPtir:** has been in turn conscious
and unconscious. To-day ehe was much
improved and hopeful chancÂ«? are heM
out by the physician in attendance for
her ultimate recovery.
The child was picked up in an uncon
scious condition the afternoon of tho
accident by Frank Vopp. a motorman on
The San Jose-avenue branch of the elec
tric line. ShÂ«Â» was lying in th" middle of
the- avenue near the corner of <_Uk street.

of 1E30 San Jose avenue, is -unable in the
remotest way to explain an accident
which befell her last Thursday afternoon,
on That subject alone her mind is a com
r>>te blank.
A suit in equity will be filed to-day in
the Superior Court by Attorneys Dorn &
Dorn and Theodore J. Savage, in which
sensational averments are made by Allen
R. Partridge, the plaintiff against Frank
"W. Page, president and general manager
of the Vulcan Bmeltfng and Iron "Works,
who is named as defendant. The action
Is brought to set aside the assignment of
patents by Partridge to Page. Through
out the complaint run allegations of fraud
and undue influence, the latter amount
ing to the complete subjtctlon of the will
of Partridge to that of the defendant and
others. 1
In the complaint some of the allegations
which have been given currency during
the past week are recapitulated and oth
ers are added. It Is set up by Partridge
that he came to San Francisco from Mex
ico a year ago. and here became acquaint
ed with Frank W. Page, who professed
friendship for him and promised to pro
tect him and exploit patents of which
Partridge was the owner. Next tt Is al

home, where the acquaintance of Mrs.
Lillian Page, wife of Frank W. Page, was
made. Page, it is claimed, represented
that he had money to Invest, and that
he had the acquaintance of rich men
whom he could Influence to put their
money Into the promotion of the Part
ridge patents. Partridge was domiciled in
the Page home for the night and there
after wa3 persuaded to remain there per
manently. Finally, so says the complaint
in substance. Partridge was willing to do
anything that Mr. and Mrs. Page, wished
him to do. Hypnotism is not alleged, but
strong Influence over the mind of Part
ridge on the part of both Mr. and Mra.
Page is. The statement Is made that both
Mr. and Mrs. Page have claimed to bo
hypnotists.
It is also alleged that no onÂ© was al
lowed to talk to Partridge except In the
presence of Mr. and Mrs. Page, and final
ly Partridge became afraid of them and
did their will. Then, according to the al
legations. Page suggested the formation
of a corporation under the name of the
Vulcan Smelting and Iron Works. Frank
"W. Page became president and general
manager: George W. Baker, vice presi
dent. Mrs. Lillian Page director. H. L.
Baker secretary and treasurer. Partridga
was frozen out. except as a director-
Partridge was persuaded to assign one
half interest in the patents to Page. Ha
was to retain one-half interest in the pat
ents, his share to be clear and non-assess
able.
All the directors and officers In- the cor
poration were elected through the Influ
ence of Page. Â«:o the allegations run. with
the exception of Baker, who was acting
as attorney for both Partridge and Page.
Partridge deeded half of the patent to
Page without consideration. Partridge
was given 3003 shares of stock in the cor
poration, but was induced to give It all
back, placing it in a pool. Partridge was
never allowed to see his friends, so it Is
set up. He was taken to Mexico and
there he was led to contract debts and
was left in a lonely spot. Under the laws
of Mexico he could ba imprisoned for
debt.
It is also alleged that Partridge has
been refused a settlement. From all this
the charge is made of fraud, misrepresen
tation and undue Influence. The story of
the making of Partridge's will is also re
peated as told In The Call. Partridge in
that document, which was drawn by Ba
ker, bequeathed two-thirds of his proper
ty to Mra. Paga and one-third to George
W. Baker, the Â¦will also naming Georg*
"\V. Bak r -* executor. Other proceedings
are to f v >w the suit to be filed to-day.

The California Theater is hereafter to
be under the entire control of Selby C.
Oppenheimer, who has purchased the
half interest in the lease of S. II. Fried
lander. Mr. Oppenheimer, though nomi
nally known as the business manager of
the theater, has really been a partner of
Mr. Friedlander, and the acquiring of the
interest of the last named gives him full
control of the California. The retirement
of Manager Friedlander Is due to illness,
contracted while on a tour with the
Brownies, with which- he-left this city
some time ago. He is still very sick in
Denver and following the advice of his
doctor has retired from active business.
Friedlander Sells His Interest.

exander of the instrument, who has build
ed a new harmonic world for his own con

beauty. The audience of yesterday af

What is wanted of soap
for the skin is to wash it
clean and not hurt it.
Pure soap does that. This
is why we want pure soap;
and when we say pure,
we mean without alkali. (
Pears' is pure; no free
alkali. There are a thou-
sand, virtues of soap; this
one is enough. You can
trust a soap that has no
biting alkali in it.
All sorts of stores sell it, especially

GRAPE-NUTS.
PADDING SKELETONS.
One Pound of Grape-K"uts Makes
More FlÂ«?sh Than Jilany Pounds
of Ordinary Food.
It is worth while to find a food that will
put two pounds a day on the frame of an
invalid that has been reduced to a skele-
ton. A lady in Middktown, Ind., says:
"For more than fifteen years I have been
more or Jess of an invalid. The doctors
paid general debility was the trouble,
brought on by overtaxing the nervou*
Fj'Ftem and the digestive organs. Then
finally la grippe and pleurisy set in. last-
ing about ten week?, and I was reduced
to a skeleton of less than seventy pounds
in weight, notwithstanding I was being
fed on meat and ordinary food.
"My relatives were telegraphed to come
quickly if they would see me alive. At
this time I was put on Grape-Xuts food,
and found I could eat It and that it suited
my tc?;te and I began at once to gain in
strength and weight. My weight increased
about two pounds per day. I reached
about one hundred pounds, which Is
heavier than I had weighed for more than
fifteen vears.
"Friends who paw me on the street
ptarod at me as though I had risen from
the df-ad. I ehaJl always be grateful for
the food Grape-ICuts food has done for
me. I shrink from having my name pub-
lished if you should use this letter, but
am willing to write to any one concerning
these statements, if in that way I can
benefit Funvring humanity in the slight-
est." Name will be given by Postum

DISMANTLING THE WRECKED STEAMSHIP IAQtTA AT MISSION
â¢ BTREET WHARF PREPARATORY TO PUTTING HER ON THE MA
RINE WAYS FOR A COMPLETE OVERHAULING.
Only a Few Coasters Make Port Dur
ing Day.
Up to sundown last night the only ar
rivals were the steam schooner Alcatras*
from Port Los Angeles, steamship Corona
from Newport, steam schooners Sonoma
from San Pedro and Sequoia from Fort
Bragg and the schooner Newark from
Bowens Landing. J The southeast storm
signals are Hying: and a gale, may now
be raging off shore and thus keeping- the
coasting fleet back. The barometer Is
steadily falling and old sailors are ask
ing: "Will we get our share of the dis
turbance to-day?"
Masters of the ships in port did not
seem to take much stock in. the storm
signals, however, as over twenty craft of
all kinds went to sea during the day. "Let
it blow from the southeast," was the reÂ»
mark of all the skippers. "It can't blow
too hard to suit us. A southeaster will
give us a good offing and that is what
we all want."-
The steamer Sequoia that came in dur
ing the day ha* made a new record be
tween here and Fort Bragg for herself.
She made the round trip in forty-two
hours and all hands are delighted with
the performance of the vessel. Consider
ing that two cargoes were handled, it was
a very smart piece of work.

ABBIVALS AND DEPASTURES.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
fleet is well in evidence these
days. The Sonoma is now nearlng
Sydney, N. S. W., having made a
record run as far as Auckland,
N. Z. She beat the Nippon Maru by six
hours, was eighteen hours ahead of her
contract time at Auckland- and her own
ers expect her to deliver the English malls
at Sydney a day ahead of time.
The Ventura, sails to-night with more
than 260 passengers all told, and every
ounce of cargo she can pack. Captain
Howard, .superintendent of the Oceanic
dock, has shown his executive ability in
getting more than 4060 tons of freight into
the vessel in" two days and at the>eame
time seeing that all the necessary repairs
and alterations were made. *.
The Sierra is at the Oceanic wharf being
overhauled - and will 'sail for Australasia
on March 6 while the Zealandia sailed for
Port Los Angeles yesterday afternoon.
The latter vessel is to take 800 Porto Rl
cans to the Hawaiian Islands. The Marl
posa Is expected back from. Honolulu soon
and the Australia is on her. way to Ta
hiti. In a few weeks the Sierra will be In
first-class shape and then the company's,

assist the people of San Francisco to set
a through line* of steamers from this port
to Manila. Ever since the eighth day of
December last the merchants who 'are In*
eluded. In the membership of the San
Francisco Board of Trade have been
waiting to get from the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company some assurance con
cerning the intentions of the steamship
management in reference to putting on
steamers from San Francisco to Manila,
or, as an alternative, making a connec
tion at Hongkong, bo that the wares and
products sent forward from this city and
State for consumption in the Philippines
might be forwarded to the islands with
out delay and with certainty of arriving 1 .
The facts have been published in The
Call concerning the failure of the mer
chants to get any such assurance as they
desire. The publication has attracted
the attention of the management of the
Oregon and Oriental Steamship Company
at Portland, Or. The Portland company
now comes forward with an offer to have
vessels now under charter stop at thia
port and then go to Manila direct and re
turn directly to San Francisco.
"We are going to put on two steamers,
the Monmouthshire and the Carmarthen
shire, In February," writes the manager
of the Portland steamship line. "We havo
five steamers on the line to Hongkong,
but three would do."
This afternoon at 2 o'clock the com
mittees elected by the several commercial
bodies of the city* to consider what can be
done to secure a direct Una to Manila will
meet at the rooms of the San Francisco
Board of Trade. The committees are as
follows: Horace Davis; William Babcock
and H. C. Somers of the Produce Ex
change; R. J. Chapman. W. E. Mlghell
and A- Chesebrough. Chamber of Com
merce; A. C. Rulofson. A. Sbarboro and
Edward Everett, Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association: Hugh Rothschild. C.
S. Benedict. Foster P. Cole, Andrew M.
r>avls and Frank J. Symmes. Merchants'
Association. They will discuss the situa
tion fully and may reach the point of
making some recommendation to the
bodies they represent.
Li. Huttenbaeh, a merchant of London,
England, and the Straits Settlements,
arrived In the city yesterday from Singa
pore en route to Europe. He is very anx
ious to meet the merchants of San Fran
cisco and Inform them of the splendid in
ducements that are offered for commercial
trading between the merchants of thi*
port and Singapore.
Mr. Huttenbach claims that he Is thd
pioneer merchant of California roods in
Singapore, as he bought a short while ago
a large consignment of machinery In San
Francisco and a large shipment of canned
goods, which he sold at a good profit In
the Straits Settlements.
"What we want badly," he said yester>
day. "is a direct line of steamers between
Singapore and San Francisco. At present
we have to get our goods via Hongkong
and by loading and reloading, of course,
we lose a lot of money. Singapore is tho
base of supply for the islands of Suma
tra and Borneo. We also supply Slam and
to a great extent the Philippines. . We are
the gateway of the Orient, and there ara
splendid facilities for an exchange of com
merce between Singapore and San Fran
cisco.
"I like Americans and their way of do-
Ing business, although the only big deal I
ever had wjth this Government was at tha
time of the Spanish war. At that time the
American troops arrived in the Philip
pines without any light clothing. I re
ceived the contract and furnished all the
khaki uniforms that were first" delivered
at Manila. I made them In Singapore and
the contract ran Into over H0O.00O.
"The population of Singapore is over
10O.COO. but there are very few whites there.
The Chinese In that Dart of the'x&rld are
very industrious and save their money.".

An attempt to rob a saloon at the corner
of Laguna and Grove streets about 11:30
last night was frustrated by the bravery
of the proprietor, who, when commanded
to "throw up his hands," rose from his
chair and grappled with the intruder,
notwithstanding that the demand was
backed up by a revolver, j After a short
struggle the proprietor wrested the pistol
from the hands, of the would-be robber,
and then shot him In the leg.
The plucky saloon-keeper Is Adam Ver
cevich, of the firm of Church & Verce
vich. His story of the affair is as follows:
"I was sitting In a chair behind the bar
waiting for the time to close, when sud
denly a man. entered, pulled a handker
chief that was around his neck up so as
tp cover part of his face, and presenting
a revolver ordered me to throw up my
hands. Instead of doing so I Jumped up
and grappled with him, and after a strug
gle, .during which the pistol went off, I
succeeded in getting the weapon. The
fellow, upon seeing that I was master of
the situation, started for. the door, and I
then fired at him, wounding- him. In the
leg."
After being shot the robber ran out the
rear of the saloon. Jumped over several
fences and entered an outhouse In the
rear of a building on Grove street, where
he was caught by Policemen John Owens
and B. F. Sawyer. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where his ? wound,
which was a slight one, was dressed.
The burglar gave his name as George
Green, and said he had just' arrived from
Helena, Mont., an hour or so before 'the
attempted robbery. He said he walked
up Market street from the ferry as far
as Larkln. then to Grove and out Grove
to Laguna. He saw â¢ Vercevich sitting
alone In his saloon, and being hungry and
broke thought he would take a chance to
get a few dollars.

two before we opened the bids I received
a telephone message asking me 'to delay
opening them for a day or two longer, as
another bid would come in. I waited, and
during thojnterim Bacigalupi bought the
property from the Italian Consul for $800,
not $1600, as hjs attorney states. He prom
ised, however, to pay $800 more if he got
the title without any trouble. I now sus
pect that the telephone message came
from some representative of Bacigalupi
in order to get more time to close their
.bargain. I made return of the sale on
January 31. and next Tuesday was set
for, hearing the petition for a confirmation
of the sale. The day following I discov
ered that the papers had not been verified
by Mr. Drinkhouse, and I asked permis
sion to amend. It was granted."
"Why did you have the date of hearing
changed to the 11th?" was asked.
"I wished to have the sale to Bohls con
firmed betore Bacigalupi could get his
deed on record and thus save the \ heirs
$1200. AlMhat he paid was $800 and the
balance was contingent. I was . acting
solely to get as much as I could for the
heirs. There is no truth in the statement
that I withheld the amended papers.' I
filed them the day I received them. The
reason why the Inventory was not filed
earlier was that we have always made it
a practice to wait until property is about
to be sold, so that we might know what
It is approximately worth. I Intend ap
pearing before Judge Troutt to-morrow
and ask him to appoint three, experts to
go to Kern and â¢ ascertain what the land
is worth. I will also ask to have. the sale
readvertlsed in all, the daily papers In or
der that the heirs may receive what is
their right. It is true that Bacigalupi has
: flled his deed to the land, but he has not
got the property yet. I want the ( matter

tributed to him by virtue of his purchase
from the Italian Consul.* His petition was
set for hearing on Tuesday last, but Ruef

know who had the papers or where they

sale. On the afternoon of
the 11th the matter was called to the at

proceedings. When- our petition came up

) "What is the value of the 160 acres
bought by 'Bacigalupi, for $1600?" was
, asked. '
"I don't know," replied Lamberson. "It
may be worth $3, or it may Â¦ be worth a
half million I dollars. Some -'land J in the
neighborhood has sold as- high as $300 an
acre."
Attorney Ruef indignantly denied ever
having promised the Italian Consul that
he would notsell the land.. "He spoke to
me about the matter," said -Ruef, "and I
told him that it would be best to have the
property distributed to. the heirs, as the
hlg-hest offer made for it up to that time
was. $60., This/offer was made In May of
last year. Neither myself nor.Mr. Drink
house had any.. intention of .selling the
property, as we considered i that It â¢ would
not bring enough 1 , to. pay: the "expenses of
sale. Along in .August or | September an
other man came to me and offered $400 for
the property. , He said that he owned the
adjoining section ; and , wanted - to . run a
pipe line thrpugh it to get water. A
month later I had another visitor with a
pipe line story and an offer of $1000 for the
land. It was then that Mr. Drinkhouse
and myself decided to advertise the prop
erty, for gale. "We advertised by permis
sion of court and received seven bids. TJie
highest one was ; that of Bohls. ; A day, or
worth two hundred times that amount "ana
the relatives of Cuoco would. never, havo
been a bit the wiser. It would have been
a "neat turn" in defrauding the heirs of
the dead.
There are always two sides to a story
and the usual recriminations. -In the
Cuoco story both sides deal ' largely in
lnuendoes. They view the doings of each
other through prejudiced eyes,. and all
they can see Is sharp practice.
"The Italian Consul." said Attorney
Lamberson yesterday, "caled on Mr. Ruef.
after receiving the power of attorney from
the heirs cf Cuoco and requested him not
to have the land sold because there was
sufficient mon-y on hand to pay ull the
debts cf the estate. He promised the Con
sul to have the land distributed to the
heirs. This was prior to November 27,
1900, when he hied the inventory, which
should have been filed within three
months after the Issuance of letters of
administration to Mr. Drinkhouse. Not
withstanding h's promise, Ruef on the day
he filed the Inventory and- appraisement
petitioned for an order to sell the real
proDerty of the estate. The petition was
granted on December 28. as there was.no
opposition. The notice of the intended
eale was published in an obscure Kern
County paper. It called for bids for the'
land. Thece bids were to be opened after
January 25. 130L When they were opened
Henry Bohls. a friend of Drinkhouse, was
the highest bidder. His bid was for $2000
and on January 31 Ruef made return of
sale to the court. The time for, hearing
the motion for confirmation of, sale was
eet for next Tuesday, the 19th inst., before
Judge Troutt. The day following: Ruef
had the order ret aside by Judre Troutt,
stating that the papers filed the day be
fore were defective and he wished to file
en amended notice of sale. At his re
quest the date for hearing the matter of
confirmation of sale was then set for last
Monday. The papers changing the "date
for confirmation of the sale were not filed
In the County Clerk's office until arfter
Judge Troutt confirmed the sale to Bohls
on Monday last. We know this to be the
fact, for we have been watching the pro
ceedings in the estate very closely, since
January 25, when Bacigalupi bought the
property for H600 from the Italian Consul.
The Consul having power of attorney for
the heirs had the right to sell the estate
without giving notice beforehand to the

Their actions were suspicious and he men

He drove up Washington street and naa

While the man who- stopped the horse

Another scandal has developed In the

Fted. better known In pugilstic circles as
"Professor Younp Dutchy." Is in the

the present csase a deliberate attempt has
been made to defraud the bdrs of Gio
vanni Cunco of. their Just rights. They
live in far away Italy and there was but
little chance of them ever learning of the
value of the estate. As tbyÂ» maiter now
stands, there are two elalmaKts, by rigrht
of purchase-, for the real property of the
decedent and both claimants allege that
they have ' # th-e ls.w on their si&e." The
property was sold for a mere trifle com
pared with what It Is said to be actually
worth. It is true that forgery was not
resorted, to. as In the Sullivan case, but
there has been trickery and sharp prac
tice,
Giovanni Cuoco was born In Italy.
"When he came to the United States he
adopted the name of John Cook, that be
ing- the English translation of his family
name. From that time on he was known
as John Cook and under that name he en
listed In the navy- After three yars' ser
vire under the flair of Uncie Sam he was
honorably discharged. He decided to
make California his home and on the ad
vice of friends he located in Kern County,
wherÂ« he took up 103 acres of land In
what is now known as the MeKittrlck dis
trict. In due course of time he received
a patent to the land and soon afterward
he came to this city. He died here in Oc
tober. 1*99. He did not leave a will and
the estate passed into the hands of John
A. Drinkhoupe. -ulio was then Public Ad
ministrator. The Public Administrator
did not file an inventory of the estate un
til November 27, 15Â», while the law re
quires that it be filed within three months
after the issuance of the testamentary
paper?. The inventory showed the estate
to consist of $220 in cash and the land in
Kern County -was appraised at $1000. In
the meantime the Italian Consul learned
that Cuoco had three brothers and nine
r.cphews and nieces living in Italy. They
were the heirs to the estate and they for
warded to Consul Serra a i>ower of at
torney to act for them. Up to that point
everything was satisfactory and regular
on its face. Since then the Consul has
sold the estate to Theodore Bacigalupl for
SSfiO, -with a promise of $SO0 more when the
title to the land is perfected, while ex-
Public Administrator Drinkhouse has ac- i
crpted the $2>Â») bid of Henry Bohls, a per

price for the property is anywhere near )
its value. Rich oil wells have been struck I
on adjacent property and land clcse to j
that owned by the estate has sold at from
52000 to $3000 an acre. Bacigalupi has al
ready filed his deed in Bakersfield and the
tale to Bohi?. alihough once confirmed, j
has been set aside. Judjje Troutt will bo
iisked to review all of the proceedings In
the hope that the heirs of Cuoco may not
be completely deprived of their rights.
