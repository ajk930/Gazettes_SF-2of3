Then a dull evening dragged into night and, the uneasy sleepers, : around whose royal home
the wind howled piteously, got what rest thev could in the intervals of a vigil which the {whole
world was keeping: in company with them. : ;
After luncheon at the castle the Prince of Wales, Emperor William and the Duke of Con
naught strolled around the- grounds and visited the Sailors' Home. The Bishop ' of Winchester,
who has been at Osborne since Saturday, visited the rector of Whippinghainv Meanwhile "most of
the ladies at Osborne House snatched a few hours of sleep.
Never has Emperor William arrived at any place in England with so little eclat. No sa
lutes were fired, no cheers were given. The men of the guardship Australia silently manned her
sides. The crowd was equally undemonstrative, the people contenting themselves with baring
their heads. It was a greeting given to the grandson of a dying woman more than to the ruler of
a great ally.
The news of the death, when it occurs, is likely to be publicly announced in London before
it is announced here. According to present arrangements the first telegram is to be sent to the
Lord Mayor of London. There is an enormous-telegraphic staff in Cowes, and additional facilities,
were installed yesterday at Osborne. . V-k:
Already the villagers are bewailing the Jate that is likely to befall Cowes, for it is known
that the Prince of Wales probably will never make Osborne House a place of residence.
There is an entire absence of local excitement. The town has settled down in patience
and sadness to await the inevitable. ; ; â¢''. ,
The Queen's rally astonished no one more than her physicians, and when at 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon they heard her ask for chicken broth their amazement almost equaled their de~
light. Privately, however, they build no false hopes upon these fading signs of what has been one
of the strongest constitutions with which woman ever was endowed. Despite the favorable after
noon the doctors dreaded greatly the period between 6 o'clock and midnight. 'When that ' was
passed they seemed hopeful that she would live at least through another day, though their memory
of the previous night's relapse kept their anxiety at high tension - v
The desperate remedies employed on Monday to enable Her Majesty to live until her.eldest
son's arrival will not be used again to the same extent, for. the doctors are fearful that the remedy
might be almost worse than the disease. They trust to prolong her life by moderate application of
stimulants combined with as much nourishment as can be assimilated. Such expedients as were
employed on Sunday evening and Monday morning are not considered justifiable.
To obtain this result they resorted 'to the frequent use of brandy and champagne. These
stimulants, used to an extent which only the greatest emergency justified, worked their process,
and when the Prince of Wales and Emperor William* entered the castle grounds, at 11:30 a. m.,
they found the Queen a trifle better than they had expected. Â¦

COWES. Isle of Wight, Jan. 22, 1 a. nC â Another day in the 'Victorian era, now so rap
idly drawing to a close, passed without any great change in the condition of Queen Vic
toria. The slight improvement so frequently, mentioned in the official bulletins merely
indicated a postponement of the inevitable. ,The end may be a matter of days or only
hours, but the members of the royal family who are now dragging out a weary visit at
Osborne House know that the death of the Queen is merely a question of a short time.
The most noticeable feature of- yesterday, was the satisfactory portion the Queen spent in
consciousness, which she regained early in the afternoon and still retained at 10 p. m. At that
hour she had not seen Emperor William, local rumors to the contrary notwithstanding. Royalty
at Osborne thus had a chance to recuperate from the terrible ordeal undergone during the early
hours of Monday. The members of the royal family were called to a room adjoining the Queen's
bedchamber no less than four times yesterday morning and were kept in momentary expectation of
being summoned to witness the end up to half-past 5. Her Majesty's physicians then had only a
vestige of hope that they would be able to keep the Queen's feeble life in existence until the Prince

Queen uttered a few feeble words. The
Emperor had come from Germany t#
bring the farewell of his mother and hiir.
relf to the dying sovereign, but he could
not fi>eak It. She was able to recognize
her grandson, who, with sad eyes, greeted
her.
The dying monarch, grandmother to the
great ruler who sto-jd beside her couch,
Fmiled faintly upon "Willful Willie, 1 as
Fhe called him as a boy. He has always
been her favorite grandson and the scene
was touching when he stood mute and
grief stricken beside her bed.
The meeting was brief, as the Queen's
physicians were desirous that she should
not be disturbed. The Queen spoke a few
words to her grani&on. and soon after
Us departure she fell into a refreshing
sleep in .tbe arms of the Princess., of
Wales.
During the afternoon the .Duchess of
Saxe-Coburg. who has been at the bed
side of tbe Queen without cessatiorr ever
since her Illness began, went on" a long
walk, accompanied only by a couple of
dogs. She took the main road to Cowes
and came back, noticed only by a few
persons, who bowed respectfully and sad
ly at the sight of her sorrowful coun
tenance and deep mourning.
As the shades of night closed in the
gToup of eilent people around the lodge
pate diminished, leaving only those whose
duty as journalists kept them in ceaseless
vigilance. The hours of darkness have
been leng indeed, occasionally broken by
messages from those at the bedside, who,
realizing the world's anxiety for news,
have communicated frequent reports. But
during this night they have been all the
same. "No change, no change"," they
have said. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦"â¢ .'Â¦Â¦.'Â¦
Thus, as another day begins to dawn,
we wonder whether it will be the last for
the dear Queen. Many members of the
royal family are utterly worn out by,
watching and are sleeping at this hour.
The Kaiser and Prince remained up long
after midnight, but finally retired, to be
called at the slightest sign of a change. "
At the bedside, never leaving, is Prin
cess Henry of Battenberg, better known
as the Queen's favorite daughter. Prin
cess Beatrice. Her eyes have scarcely
known eleep for many nights, but she
sticks to her place with loving duty and
unflinching courage".

X^ars 'since there was. even" a nominal re-'
publican party In this country. It was
snuffed outs.by the outburst of sympathy
occasioned by the Illness of ; the Prince" of
Wales. Since that time there has been
practically no \ t republican agitation in
any. part of the'empire. The colonies are
republican already, but at home the trend
of events has- been In the .direction of Im
perialism.
But in the troublous times which are
awaiting .us we may count with, certainty
upon the revival of a republican propa
ganda, which will become serious only
when financial and military I disasters
thicken around, the throne. Abroad the
disappearance of the Queen will add per
ceptibly to the 'feeling of political unrest

monarchy than It has been for the last
thlrjy years. The influence of the Queen
was immense, and wherever her Cabinet
divided it was almost supreme. : The
sovereign Queen, although somewhat
limited in the range of her ideas, held
with the utmost tenacity to the principles
upon which she be'ieved the emplrs
should be governed. She was also per
sonally known to almost even' reigning
sovereign, and with some of tho most im
portant ehe lone had been in dose Â¦ per
sonal correspondence. Hence she became
permanent Prime Minister of the em
pire. . .
The political effect of the assumption
by the Queen of the title of Kalsaf-1-Hind,
or Empress of India, and the assertion of
her supremacy has been very marked as
far as regards the native rulers and peo
ple of India t>roper, but has made but

EMPEROR VISITS THE QUEEN
OL'EEN VICTORIA was pro
claimed Empress of India on
January 1. 1S77. It Is said
that this step was taken not
only for political reasons
connected with the adminis
tration of the Government of
that country but also to set
tie certain annoying and disagreeable
questions of precedence that had arisen
at thp court â¢with the coming to England
of Princess Manfe Alexandrovna, the
daughter of the Czar Nicholas II, as the
wife of the Queen's second son. Prince Al
fred. Duke of Kdinburgrh.
Their marriage took place In St. Peters
burg on January 23. 1874. and soon after
tha arrival of the royal couple in Eng
land the Princess Marie gave evidence of
a disposition to claim precedence, as the
daughter of an Emperor, over the Prince
of Wales, her husband's eldest brother,
Â¦who Â¦was bat the son of a Queen, and, it
is said, even over the Queen herself.
However th!s may be. the whole ques
tion was fettled emphatically when Queen
Victoria was proclaimed Empress of In
dia. This was done under an act of Par
liament called the royal titles act. passed
in 1S76, and on January 1 following, at a
durbar held in Delhi, India, the act was
proclaimed before a vast assemblage
of Governors, Lieutenant Governors,
heads of Government, native rulers, chiefs
and nobles, such as had not been gathered
tog-ether before in modern times.
Queen Victoria had long been regarded
by a great part of the inhabitants of In
dia as a descendant of the great Mogul,
and therefore unl\-ersal suzerain by right
of succession. * The great mutiny of 1Po7
had proved the deathblow to the East In

The Novosti says; "England Is discon

plainly If Queen Victoria dies. Her suc
cessor will probably entertain different
views on many questions. He Is credited
with strong French sympathies. Tha
power of an English sovereign is greater

national policies."
"With her will depart Britannia's good
genius."
ST. PETERSBURG, Jant** 21.â In tha "
comment of all circles not influential on
Queen Victoria's Illness the personal
note dominates the political. The Czar'3
subjects freely admit that her Majesty
has been one of the principal bulwarks
of peace. The Rossla and the Novostl
alone touch the political chord. The Ros
sla says: r ;*Â¦-:
"England's prestige is largely due to
the Queen. To spare Queen Victoria

ther trace of him could be found. A few
days afterward, however, the same man
fired again at her Majesty and was
promptly arrested. HÂ« proved to be a
half-witted young man named Francis.
A month later a man named Bean took
aim with hla pistol at the Queen, but th*
weapon missed fire.
These successive attempts on her llfÂ«
much affected the young sovereign, all
the more that they were entirely unpro
voked, and aroused great excitement and
indignation among her subjects.
In 1SJ3 an Irish bricklayer named Ham
ilton fired a shot at the Queen, but the
pistol was loaded with powder only. Ha
either only wished to frighten her or for
got to put in the ball.
In 1S50 Robert Pate, an ex-lieutenant of
hussars, for some fancied grievance
against her attacked the Queen with a
cane, but was seized before he had time
to strike a second blow and was nearly
torn to pieces by the crowd.
In 1872 a boy thrust a petition for the re
lief of some Fenian prisoners before tha
Queen with one hand while with the othÂ«*r
he presented a pistol. He was seized ana
disarmed before he could flre.
On March 22. 18S2. another demented
man. one Roderick McClean, fired a shot
at the Queen as she was passing from
the train to her carriage at the Windsor
station. The shot very narrowly mlased;
her. McClaln was seized and tried for
high treason, as were all the others, but
It only required a short time In the court
room to demonstrate his hopeless insan
ity.
After that incident, however, more pre
caution has been taken to forestall any
attempt on the part of cranks or crim
inals to hurt or frighten her Majesty.

times by crack-brained desperadoes.
The first attempt on her life was made
on June 10. 1840, when" a youth. named Ox

Queen. as her husband was driving her

LONDON, Jan. 21.â The dispatches re

in Trabold's Hotelat One Hundred and
Twenty-second street and Amsterdam ave
nue on Sunday night the police express
the opinion they hava a murder case sim
ilar In some respects to that of Jennie
Bosschleter, the Pateracn factory girl.
At present, however, there is no
proof of murder against the girl's
lover. The Coroner's physician made
an autopsy on the girl's body to
night and while unwilling after
ward to state positively the cause of
death until an analysis of the contents of
the stomach was made., he was inclined
to believe she died of chloral poisoning.
The police theory <sÂ» that the drug was
administered to her by the man for im
moral purposes, and frightened by the re
sult he took what was left of the poison
himself, meaning to commit suicide.
There Is nothing, however, to show It
was not a case of a double attempt at sui
cide which only the man has survived.
The girl has been identified, and the
name of the man found in the room
with her body, mumbling and cry
ing like a lunatic Is known. She
was Margaret Travis, 19 years old,
an employe of St. Luke's Protest
ant Episcopal Home at One Hun
dred and Fourteenth street and Broad
way, and the man with whom she wen*
to the hotel was Clarence X. Davis, an
ironworker, who has followed his trade
in a number of cities in this State since
he arrived here about three years ago.
On Saturday night the couple started
out for a walk, saying to a sister of Miss
Travis' that they would be back in a
half-hour. It was 11 o'clock when the
couple appeared at Trabold's HoteL Tra
bold, the proprietor, who was in the of
fice when the couple came in, said they
did not seem to have been drinking. Davis
registered a> "A. L. Smith and wife,
Troy. N. T." The room they were shown
to was a small one, with scarcely more
than enough room for a double bed in it.
After they got to the room they called
for a waiter and ordered two glasses of
sherry.
Toward midnight on Sunday Ttabold
made up his mind something was wrong
as the couple had been without anything
to eat all day, and he called in Policeman
Fox. The door was forced open. The
men found the Travis girl lying on the
bed. She was fully dressed, save for her
hat- Davis was crouching on the floor
behind- the door, holding the girl's hat
In one hand, staring wildly at the body
on the bed and mumbling like a crazy
man. All efforts to get any explanation
of her death from him were futile.
The policeman called an ambulance
The surgeon declared the girl had been
dead for several hours. Davis, he said
was In a bad way, and evidently had
taken some drug. The girl might have
been drugged or she mig-ht have died of
heart disease. Her body was sent to the
police station. Davis, raving like a mad
man, was taken to the J. Hood Wright
Hospital. :Jil>IMWIUt8>

CONTRACT LABOR
LAW VIOLATED
TbÂ© Chamber, by a vote of 2S8 to 22$,
directed that the Premler'B speech be
Â»ost*4. throughout thÂ« country.
M. Waldeck-Roussean replied that the
bill would be a test point aa to wbetner
civil power or religious authority wa* to
have supremacy. The Government, he
added, asked the Chamber to continue the
confidence accorded it during the past
eighteen months by voting this portion of
its programme. If they (the Ministers)
had not thought the House would do so,
they would no longer assume responsi
bility for the task they had accepted.
The Premier denied that the church In
any way was threatened, declaring that
the Government simply desired by the bill
to assure peace and the regular develop
ment of the institutions of the country.
"It it bÂ« true, aa the opponent* of the
bill assert." said M. Waldeek-Rousseau;
"that the congregations are indispensable
to the develooment of the church, why
did not the concordat re-establish them?
On the contrary. It does not speak of
them, but only of the secular clergy. Not
a single corjjrejration exists to aid the
priests of poor parishes, whereas a num
ber of the latter arÂ» under the tyranny
of the irregular priesthood. The congre
gations have not onlv drained the money
of the country, but they have drained itÂ«
conscience, and the parish priests now
only receive the confessions of common
people. The Catholic clergy have noth
ing to fear from thi* bilL The only per
sons it will hurt are Ihe irregular clergy."
M. Waldeck-Bcusseau showed that con
gregations in all times and countries, had
been oblijed to submit to rigorous au
thority. He said that it was necessary for
the civil power to take back from the
cor.grr rations the privilege of teaching
the children, because the congregations
had ever b*en eeeklns from the com
ner.cement of the century to bring about
a counter revolution.
"Never have they been more dangerous
than they are now," he exclaimed. "They
are tryinr to gain control of universal
suffrage, and to that end they are cre
ating a. new electoral congregation: but
we are tired of this slavery and demand
emancipation. We have to choose be
tween the corjrreratiors , and fidelity to
the republic, we neard much talk about
an 'open republic' I ask nothing* better,
but it must be open fiÂ»r the people to ea
ter and to letre."
Count de Mun reproached M. Waldeck-
Rousseau for having declared that the
milliard of property in France belonging
to the religious congregations was an eco
nomic peril, and declared the statement
haji been made la order to revive the an
cient dread of monastic wealth and serf
dom, which had long since disappeared.
Moreover, be said, this sum was grossly
exaggerated In order to create a greater
impression. He warned the Government
that its policy was imprudent and ill ad
vised. M. 'Valdeck-Rousseau, the Count
added, might not Intend to carry out his
designs to the end of his anti-clerical pas
sion. Possibly he only intended to ap
pease his collectivist friends, but the lat
ter might eventually set him aside and
carry out the work themselves.
Count de Mun concludrd with declaring
the object of the Government rras to take
teaching oat of the hands of the congre
gations.
"You have be^un a religious war." he
said, turning to the Government benches,
"and this will weigh heavily on you. As
to us, we shall continue to combat you
and hoDÂ« to find in this chamber a suf
ficient number of friends and lovers of
liberty to aid us."
The Rightists and Centrists gave Count
de Mun a great ovation on the conclusion
of his remarks.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2Lâ The
Senr.te In executive session to
day confirmed the nomination
of James S. Harlan to be At

The final vote was reached after a discus
sion of more than two hours' duration,
and when announced stood 42 to 21 In
favor of confirmation. All the Republi
cans cast their votes In the affirmative
and two or three Democrats voted with
them.
The session was characterized by a spir
ited colloquy betrreen Senators Chandler
and Hawley. in which bitter personal
language was used. The controversy be
tween them grew out of a letter written
by Senator Chandler In 1*77. and which
was? rpad by Senator Pettigrew. concern
ing the controversy over the Hayes and
Tilden election, in which reference was
made to the part taken by Senator Haw

time.

bers of the committee, giving Mr. Harlan
the appointment of Associate Judge and
offering Mr. Hawley the place of director
of the Paris Exposition, which the latter
had declined. Chandler said, because of
the inadequacy of the salary.
When this point In the article was
reached Hawley interrupted In somewhat
excited manner to denounce the statement
as false, which he did in very emphatic
and plain language. Chandler replied in
like manner, saying that the article had
been prepared by him twenty-three years
ago, that it had never before been contra
dicted and that he did not repudiate it.
He added that the whole subject was an
cient history and announced his intention
to vote for Mr. Karlan's confirmation.
Senators Spooner. Mason and Lindsay
made brief speeches. Mason spoke of Mr.
Harlan's qualifications as a lawyer, and
paid that he did not think any the less of
Justice Harlan because of his attachment
for his family. Spooner said there ap
peared to be no opposition except that of
Senator Pett.'grew. Referring to Senator
Spoonpr's remarks. Pettigrew quoted ex
tracts from editorials in a number of
newspapers In reprobation of Harlan's
nomination. He said he had no purpose
to delay a vote, and when he concludes
the ballot was taken.
JAMES S. HABLAN, THE SON OF ASSOCIATE SUPREME JUSTICE
HARLAN. AND WHOSE NOMINATION AS ATTORNEY GENERAL
FOR PORTO RICO HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.
HUTCHINSON, Kans., Jan. a.â Mrs.
Carrie Nation, the Wichita saloon wreck
er, lecturing last night to an audience
that filled the largest church in Hutchin
son, said:
"You'll hear from me again before long
and it won't be from a lecture platform
either. God intends that I* keep up what
I have already begun in Wichita, and I'll
do it- .Wichita isn't the only town Â«n
Kansas that has rocks and brickbats."
This sentiment was applauded and Mrs.
Nation continued:
"I will gladly give up my life, if need
be. while destroying these awful places."
Mr. Nation, who accompanied his wife,
said he would immediately begin inlt
against Sedgwlck County for false impris
onment- He stated that while his wife
was in Jail the authorities offered to let
her go If she would agree not to sue for
damages. - Â¦ Â¦ . -

At 10 o'clock to-night Mrs. Wilhoit was
arrested at her home without making any
resistance and taken to the County Jail,
where sbe also was placed In a cell In the
steel rotary next to that of Mrs. Nation.
When Mrs. Wilhoit was ushered into the
steel cage. Mrs. Nation cried "Hallelu
jah!" and began to pray.
Half an hour later Mrs. Evans was ar
rested at her home, but owing to the con
dition of her wounded arm ehe was given
the Jailer's comfortable room. She was
quietly brought into the Jail to avoid
arousing the prayerful passions of Mrs.
Nation. Mrs. Muntz could not be Tound
when the officers called at her homw.
It Is said that a comDlalnt of insanity
will be lodged against Mrs. Nation In the
morning-, and that If that falls the men
holding insurance on the plate glass doors
and windows will prosecute her.
The constant stream of curious people
going through the wrecked saloon shovra
no abatement. Society is no exception,
and it is estimated that 1000 women have
seen the Inside of a saloon for the first
time Jn their lives..
Business men of the city are very much
aroused, and had Mrs. Nation been a man
this afternoon it is not too much to say
that the Coroner instead of the Sheriff
would have her in charge now. Notwith
standing her sex. a few hotheads talked
of ducking her in the river.
Mrs. Nation was assisted by Mrs. Juliaa
Evans, Mrs. Lucy Wllhoit and Mrs.
Lydia Muntz, all of the local W. C. T. L\
organization. With hatchets concealed
under their cloaks they entered the salooi
of James Burns on Douglass avenue and
did not leave a complete piece of glass or
a. working slot machine In the place. All
show cases, both for liquors and cigars,
as well as the plate-glass windows and
doors, were broken to pieces. With light
ning speed they ran to John Herrig's sa
loon and had everything in the front of
the* room. Including the plate-glass win
dows, broken when he appeared with a
revolver, placed it at Mrs. Nation's head
and said that he would blow out her
brains if she did not desist. She yielded
before the pointed revolver and with her
companions ran to the Carey Hotel, where
she made her initial attack on the Wich
ita saloons, three weeks ago. There three
policemen met her and she struck at De
tective Sutter with a poker. The officers
then overpowered Mrs. Nation and her
friends and took them to the City Prison.
Chief of Police Cubbon discharged* the
prisoners after they reached the Jail.
They, made him a promise not to wreck
any more saloons before noon to-morrow.
After leaving the city building Mrs. Na
tion began a street lecture to the immense
crowd that had surrounded the city
building, saying that she expected to be
gin saloon-wrecking again at noon to
morrow, when her truce with the Chief of
Police expires. Shaking her fist at the
crowd, she said:
"Men of Wichita, this is the right arm
of God and. is destined to wreck every
saloon in your city."
The women procured a wagon and rode
through the streets in it, singing "Nearer,
-xy God. to Thee" and kindred hymns
They halted in front of the saloons they
had smashed and held prayer meetings.
The damage done by the three wome \
is estimated at between 51000 and 12000.
The affair created great excitement and
it is estimated that 5000 persons, both men
and women, viewed the wreckage.
Mrs. Nation caused a new sensation to
right by slapping Sheriff Simmons on the
face, taking hold of his ears arÂ»d giving
him a rough handling generally. Mra. Na
tion was at the Union depot in the act of
buying a ticket to a neighboring town
when the Sheriff pulled at her eleeve.
saving: "You are my prisoner, madam."
Mrs. Nation turned her face about, and
seeing Sheriff Simmons gave hfm a violent
slap across the face. She followed this
up by taking hold of his ears with her
two hands and wringing them viciously.
The Union depot was full of women, who
began screaming, and tremendous excite
ment occurred as the Sheriff, who is a
very smallman. struggled with, his pow
erful antagonist. A policeman came to
his rescue, and with the aid of some by
standers they succeeded in picking up the
woman In their arms and placing her in
a cab, which was driven rapidly to the
County Jail. She Insisted on being placed
in the private room for women, but Sher
iff Simmons was in no humor to provide
her with luxuries, and put her in a cell
in the steel rotary, where she began to
pray and sing hymns.

::' Colonel. Heuer of the United States en
gineer corps appeared before the commit
tee in response to an invitation by Rals
toh, who desired to get' information as to
the intentions of .the Federal Government.
Colonel Heuer said work could proceed
with the $500,000 now available provided
the State would pay for; one-half _of the
real estate" purchased for sites. He said
that 90 per cent of the work must be done
by contract, and that .It could be done
much cheaper if the entire $800,000 of the
estimated cost were available from the
.beginning. V >.: .â¢ :.::V ;*
Colonel Heuer said that the $500,000
would not be sufficient to complete the im
pounding basin, and that if after it had
been expended either the United States or
California should fail to appropriate its
share for the completion of the work the
other's share would not be available, and
the entire $500,000 expended i would : be lost,
as well as the benefits to be given by the
system. :
Â¦In reply to questions Colonel Heuer ex
pressed complete confidence in the pro
posed system. : He ' said he believed that
within two or I three years i hydraullcklngr
would be able to proceed without any re
straint whatever. . He was not sure that
local â¢ barriers to hold back the debris
eould;bÂ«-dispensedvwltlr entirely, though
auch was the opinion of the Debris Com-
mission. He did not regard the Impound
ing basin and dams, however, as in any
sense experimental.
Colonel Heuer repeatedly said on being
questioned concerning the Federal policy
that the engineers were not in favor of
expending any money on the proposed
construction works unless the entire nec
essary appropriation were assured.

Assembly Committee on Municipal

Favorably.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO Jan. 21.â The Broughton bill,
regulating the sale of franchises, has been
so amended In committee that it is prob
able all concerned will rush it through,
for all seem satisfied. The amendments
which were Bent up from the south have
been grafted upon the bill, and in its ,
amended form the Assembly Committee
on Municipal Corporations has decided to
report it favorably to the Assembly.
The committee met for the consideration
of the bill this afternoon, and when th*
measure was brought up Broughton start- \
ed to submit amendments. First, in sec- ,
tion 1. he amended the bill so as to include
easpipe lines for heat as well as power.
and also to exempt all steam railroad
fines from the provisions of the act. Tne
bin in its original form exempted ah
steam railroads doing an Interstate busi
ness The mission of Ferdinand K Rule,
treasurer ot the Salt Lake road, who was
up here last Friday, was to amend thi*
section so as to include steam railroads
intending to do an interstate business,
which lT the condition of the Salt Lake
road- but the amendment made to-day
goes even further than that.
In the second section, where the original
bill leaves the Question of advertising v,
franchise to the discretion of the govern
ing body of a municipality, the bill was
amended so as to add to this discretionary
power the restriction that, when the ap
plication for a franchise is accompanied
by the petition of the owners of tbxee
fourths of the Â¦ real property along the
frontage of the franchise applied for, then
the governing body of the municipality
must advertise it.
Â¦ Regarding the provision fixing 2 per cent
of the gross earnings' as the minimum to
be charged by municipalities, and leaving
.the maximum indefinite, an amendment
was adopted making a definite rate of 2
per cent of the gross receipts payable to
.the municipality.
A new section was added to the bill
which provides that work must be com
menced by a successful bidder within four
months, or he shall forfeit his franchise;
and it must be completed within three
years, or again he shall forfeit all, unless
in either case the time has been extended
for good reasons.
Another new section added provides that
nothing in the act shall be construed as
repealing or amending acts for the con
struction of bicycle or automobile paths,
or providing for the granting of fran
chises by municipalities to railroads or
street railways extending beyond their
limits to public parks.
The traction company of Los Angeles
sent up a bill which Included all .the
amendments and accepted provisions of
the Broughton bill, with this addition:
It provides that when an application for a
franchise is accompanied by a petition
signed by the owners of three-fourths of
the property fronting on the proposed
franchise, then the governing body of any
municipality shall grant the franchise
asked* but the amendment requiring ad
vertisement, under the same circum
stances, seemed to be satisfactory, and it
is not probable that the traction com
pany's measure will be introduced. There
was some talk of urging it as a committee
substitute, but this idea was abandoned.
James of Los Angeles was anxious to
have action by the committee on the bill
postponed, but it was decided that if there
had been any serious objections to the bill
even as amended there had' been ulenty
of time for the Los Angeles delegation to
arrive; so a vote was taken, and, as
amended, it was decided to recommend
the bill for passage.
The companion bill In the Senate has
not yet been considered in committee, nor
would be foolish for tha friends of the
university to insist on the fixed incoma
plan, for by such a stand any legislative
aid during this session would be sacri
ficed.
President Wheeler reiterated that tha
end. in financial aid commensurate with
the university's needs, was what he and
those he represented sought, and that
they were content to leave the choice of
method to tha Legislature. There seems
no longer the slightest doubt that tha
Rowell bills will be allowed to die in com
mittee, probably without any action what
ever being: taken on them, and that new
bills will be introduced, drafted along tha
lines indicated by Governor Gage. As a
result of President Wheeler's visit it is
probable that the bill for a direct appro
priation will fix the amount at $C.V>.'Â«Â»)
instead of $200,000, as suggested by Gov
ernor Gage.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 2Lâ The Navy
Department has cut from the specifica
tions for the rÂ«w battle-ships items ag
gregating In value about JSO.OOO. It also
has considerably reduced the fund re
served for superintendents, inspection

Â¦was able to offer to the lowest bidders,
the Newport News and Bath corpora

Estimates of Appropriations.
WASHINGTON, Jan. ZL â Secretary
Gage to-day submitted to the House
deficiency estimates of appropriation*
for the .various departments to comolere
the service up to June 30. 1901. amounting
to $U.286,052. and $3.*41,9S5 for the postal
service, payable from the postal revenues.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â No business of
special importance was transacted by the
Senate to-day In Open session. An execu
tive session of more than two hours" du
ration was held and sixty pages of the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill were completed before ad
journment.
An act to confer in trust to the city of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, the pueblo of
Albuquerque grant was passed.
Turner of Washington offered a resolu
tion requesting the President to transmit
to the Senate. If n#t incompatible with
public Interest, information of what steps
have been taken by the State. Department
to protect the rights of R. E. Brown, a
citizen of the United States, in the matter
of his claim against the South African
Republic, together with copies of all cor
respondence and papers relating thereto.
The resolution waa adopted.
In presenting the resolution Turner
made a statement regarding the case.
Brown, the Senator said, was an Ameri
can engineer, who went to South Africa
eight years ago. He located a large num
ber of gold mining claims in Witfontein,
adopting American methods in his work.
He waa deprived of the claims by order
of the South African authorities, and In
stituted suit against them for $1,850,000.
The case was decided by the South Af
rican court in Brown's favor, his conten
tion being upheld upon every point, not
withstanding the order of President Kru
ger withdrawing the claims held by Mr.
Brown from location. The Judgment of
the court so incensed President Kruger
and the Volksraad that the judges were
removed summarily from office. Subse
quently the new court dismissed the case
of Mr. Brown, and he was invited to in
stitute a new suit. Realizing that the
court was packed against him, he decided
to appeal to his own Government for jus
tice and with a view to securing his
rights as defined by the highest court of
the Transvaal Republic.
Turner said the claims of Mr. Brown
now were worth $5,000,000 or $8,000,000. In
view of the governmental changes that
had taken place in the Transvaal Turner
said the purpose of his resolution was
to press upon Great Britain the merit of
the claim of Mr. Brown and to ascertain
what steps had been taken by this Gov
ernment in regard to it since Great Brit
ain had assumed the responsibilities of
sovereign over that country.
The Senate at 1 p. m.. on motion of
Foraker, went Into executive session, and
on resuming open session the legislative
appropriation bill was taken up.
Gallinger of New Hampshire said that
on last Friday, during the discussion of
the amendment to the army reorganiza
tion bill, intended to prohibit the sale of
liquor in the Philippines, he had made a
statement that liquor licenses had been
Issued to saloons in Manila by an army
officer whose residence was in California â
meaning General Harrison Gray Otis. HÂ«
then read a telegram from General Otl9
saying .that he had never granted and
never had the power to grant such license.
Gallinger expressed regret that he had
been led into the error he had made.
"Does that telegram tell." inquired
Cockrell of Missouri, "who did issue the
licenses?"
"It does not," replied Galllnger. .
On 'motion of Allison, chairman of thÂ«
Committee on Appropriations, the Senate
then proceeded to the consideration of the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill. When, in the.readinar of the
bill, the "paraarraph â¢was reached appro
priating. 510,000 to keep open the Library
of Congress from 2 until m p. m. on each
Sunday. Gallinper said he desired to enter
his protest against the opening of the li
brary on Sunday. Confess, it seemed to
him. had dealt very generously with the
library and the people of the pistrict of
Columbia, and the latter ought to be sat
isfied that the library was open thirteen
hours each weekday. v
Allison replied that the proposed amend
ment had been recommended by two conv
mlttees of the Senate and by the Libra
rian of Congress. Personally, he could see
no better way for persons sojourning- In
Washington or for residents here to spend
a few hours on Sunday than in the Li
brary of Congress. The amendment was
asrreed to without division. The Senate
then adjourned.

WASHINGTON,- Jan. 21.â The House to
day, after devoting some time to District
of Columbia business, passed a number
of bills under suspension of the rules. A
bill to give citizens of-forelgn countries
the right .to sue in the Court of Claims
for indemnity for alleged injuries which
had been recommended by the State De
partment was disastrously beaten.
Thr. poatoflice appropriation bill was re
ported.
The Senate amendments to the army re
organization bill were disagreed. to and
the House agreed to a conference. Hull
of Iowa, Brownlow of Tennessee and Hay
of Virginia were appointed conferees. â¢
The House then proceeded with district
business. After some debate the vote was
taken and the bill was passedâ 137 to 57.
After the disposal Of the district busi
ness. White of North Carolina was recog
nized to move the passage, under a sus
pension of the rules, of a bill to provide
a home for aged and infirm colored peo
ple. The bill provides that the money for
the construction and maintenance ci the
home shall consist of the fund now (n the
treasury due the estates of deceased col-
ored soldiers.' The fund amounts to $230,

to be erected in the District of Columbia
on ground now in the possession of a col

pose.-
Ray of New York, chairman â¢ of the
Committee on Judiciary, moved - the pas
sage, under suspension of the rules,. of a
bill to permit subjects of a- foreign coun
try claiming indemnity for Injuries re
ceived in this country, to bring suit in the
Court of Claims. The bill, by its terms,
applies only to pert- 3ns not citizens of the
United States, and . provides that the
United States can * set up as a Â¦ defense
against such claims that the claimants
have resided in the United States con
tinuously for one year. Ray explained
that the State Department had been over
run with claims of foreign . citizens for
indemnity and the proposed legislation
was strongly recommended by that de
partment. ' Â¦ j
Hltt of Illinois said the bill had* been
prepared by former Secretary of State

said,' had resulted in the presentation and
payment of extravagant claims.
De Armond of Missouri, on behalf of a

opposed the bill, which, he said, proposed
to give to foreign citizens privileges not
accorded to our own citizens, t The reci

These bills are similar and seek to add
harbors to the caees- where, the right of
eminent domain may be appealed to; and
In applying It the framers of the measure
had in view the harbor of Belvedere, dot
ted with arks and houseboats and yachts
and bordered with picturesque residences.
But it was pointed out that often these
same residences needed regulating, and
whenever any attempt has been 'made to
regulate them the attempt has been met
with the answer that the owners of the
property along the beach had allowed the
offending ark to anchor wnere It lay: and
so. what was the town going to do about
it? So the town is anxious to have the
right to condemn the beach property as
tide lands abounding a harbor, and so
solve the cuestion.
It was claimed that the arks frequently
anchor where what can be considered the
fairway Is located and that they helped
to fill up the channel by throwing over
board rubbish. It was explained that in
five or 6ix .tides an oilcan would raise a
two-foot lump of mud in the channelâ and
the channel is very shallow at best The
town courts the presence of the arks, but
wishes the control of them. , The land
sought is owned mostly by the Coleman

Association. Engraved Indelibly on their
memory is the recent reception at the
hands of Vice President J. C. Stubbs and
Traffic Manager William Sproule when
the members of the committee asked for
a consideration of the freight rate dis
crimination against Los Angeles to San
Joacuin points. No eatisfaction was given
the committee, and the members were
rives to understand that the Southern Pa
cific -would make no changes in the rate
Â¦chedule, which now gives San Francisco
Jobbers the preference over Los Angeles
to all common p/lnta.
Wliat has happened E'.r.ce Is a matter or
record. The Los Angeles Traffic Associa
tion appealed to the only power which
could help it In the matterâ the State
Railroad Commission. That body is gen
er&Ilr supposed to be friendly to the
Southern Pacific Company, and its ded
eica Is not awaited with any great degree
of confidence by the Los Angeles Jobbers.
But times have changed in the Southern
Pacific world. The reception accorded vis
itor* at the general oSees in the old days
la eaid to have given Tray to an air of
fenuine warmth since President Hays' in
cumbency.
Emboldened bv these stories from San
Francisco, the Traffic Association wrote
Mr. Hays a courteous letter, requesting:
>iiwi to confer with it on the matter o:
rate discrimination, and he^ livine up to
tha title he earned on the Grand Trunkâ
"the Little Gentleman"â wrote a no less
'courteous reply, in which he grants thÂ»
request. President Hxys may not have
the power to adjust the matter to tlie
entire satisfaction of Los Angeles, for. as
he said in his Interview while in this city.
â¢â¢I will endeavor to treat all districts
without discrimination, but." he added
with a smile, "there is oftentimes quite a
difference of opinion on what constitutes
/â¢â¢Â¦rr'n-inatlon."

congratulation that in one opinion at least we. can be
heartily in accord with' our English friends.
So:ne complaint is -made, and -we respect those
whe make it and. share their, motive; that the bill
requires; only one-fourth of, the crews ;of subsidized
ships to be American citizens. We "stand ready, if^the
bill become. law, to " hail \ the appearance' under t it of
American ships with a sliding scale amendment which
When the Jaw diverts that vast sum from alien to
American ship-owners its ultimate distribution will
be to the same classes in this country. Economists
have long observed that Americans have lost their sea
faring tendency. Even in our navy native American
sailors are perhaps in the minority." If the law to re
store shipping absolutely required that our merchant
marine shall employ only American sailors the policy
wculd be blocked ''at the beginning '.because "of 'the
dearth of American sailors'. Every good citizen looks
forward to the time' when American ships wiili be
manned by seamen who are American citizens. ?.But
we must first have the ships. This explami why the
pending measure is primarily devoted to getting/ the
ships. The American seaman, has on his- side' the
overwhelming â¢ American feeling, 1 which is the : final
cause of. the proposed legislation,^ and [will* protect
h:s interests as stoutly as it will those of American
thip-builders. , v , ;
The $160,000,000 paid last year to foreign ship
owners for. carrying American freight to its market
went to the profits of those ship-owners and to the
wages of foreign sailors and ship-builders, marine
underwriters and architects. -
IN such constructive legislation as, is required^to re-
Store American shipping it js. not reasonable to
expect that perfection can be_ reached at once!
The purpose .of the law may not -be all accomplished
at once. But \i should not be forgotten that it ia
easier to amend a law when a part of the statutes

This morning's dispatches report hiyi ill
at San Antonio; Tex. I
It is well that the cattle men have gone by them
selves, to let the country know that the conclusions
of the convention on these subjects are not those of
the entire . livestock interest, but of the sheep men
alone. The cattle, horse and swine interests require
the preservation of the forests, the maintenance of
moisture and the extension of irrigation, and therein
?.re in line with enlightened public sentimentand the
best conclusions of economic science.
Another demand was made by the aggressive sheep
men. This was to the effect that forest reserves be
confined to the actual large timber. The Black Mesa,
in Arizona, is covered by a dense chaparral, which pre
vents evaporation and preserves moisture, and for
these purposes has been made a forest reserve. There
are other regions like it in Arizona and New Mexico.
If these covered localities are open to sheep they are
gradually stripped of their cover by fire, which pro
duces open space for grass during one or two sea
sons, when the land becomes so dry that all growth
ceases. If this process be practiced the aridity of the
plains below is increased, the streams are alternately
torrential and dry, the deep springs cease to flow and
the country is permanently injured.
The cattle men, in view of the situation, refused to
be an\- longer submerged in the National Association
controlled by the nomads, and therefore formed and
organized the American Cattle-growers' Association,
which will meet in Denver in March- Their temper
as to the forest reserves was shown in their executive
committee, which proposed to take immediate steps
to prevent the grazing of the reserves. In this they will
have the i-ympathy and support of the irrigators and
ali classes and organizations which desire to preserve
the forests and conserve the waters of the arid region.
It is apparent from the reports that the nomadic
sheep men who own iittle or no land but wander with
their flocks over hundreds of miles of range prac
tically dominated the convention, and not only fought
to prevent preservation of the public range by lease
hold control, but also, in view of the rapid exhaustion
of that range by sheep, demanded that its loss be sup
plemented by opening to them the reserves.
AX unpleasant impression has been caused bj' the
demand of the convention of the National
Livestock Association that the forest reserva
tions be thrown open to grazing by stock. This im
pression is all the more unpleasant because the de
mand means that the reserves be opened to sheep
alone. Cattle will not graze where sheep are or have
been. In effect the sheep have already driven the cat
tle off the grass and sage ranges of the plains. The
cattle men have but little command of the open
range and are much confined to the use of land which
they own. They are opposed to grazing the forest
reserves because it means destruction of their water
sources. It is fair to say that this objection is com
mon also to the sheep men who own land and con
fine their flocks to their holdings.
SHEEP IN FOREST RESERVES.
Of course the pension is small. It is but $50 a
month, and the country is rich. As in the case of so
many pensions of an almost similar nature, it appears
mean and stingy to oppose it. None the less the fact
remains that a line should be drawn somewhere in
the pension policyof the Government, while it seems
to be the intention of Congress to draw no line at
all but to leave the field open for claims of all kinds.
Unless public opinion force a check upon 'the ten
dency now so marked we shall eventually have a
civil pension list that will be something of a national
scandal. '* -
No one in the United States can have any personal
antagonism to the proposed pensioner. He is doubt
less a worthy man who is now old and infirm and re
quires support in his old age. Conceding all that the^
objection remains^hat the people of the United
States have not yet adopted a policy of providing life
pensions for the aged. Mr. Davis had as fair a chance
to save a competence for his declining years as most
other men in this country. The distinguished son
had ample opportunities during his life to provide
for his father just as other sons do. It is therefore
an unfair thing, to tax the mass of the American peo
ple to provide a pension of that kind.
It is to that extent, however, the Senate has just
gone in passing a bill providing a life pension for
Horatio N. Davis, whose sole title to support from
the Government is that, he is the father of the late
Senator Davis of Minnesota.
ANOTHER PENSION PRECEDENT.
WHEN Congress provided, a pension for Con
gressman Boutelle of Maine by placing him or.
the retired list of the navy there was consid
eral disapproval on the part of the public. It was felt
that the action established a bad precedent in pen
sion legislation, and that out of it might eventually
grow a custom of providing pensions for all rioted
Congressmen on retiring from' active life. At that
time it was never suspected there might be a still fur
ther extension of the pension courtesies of the two
houses, and that we should see life pensions provided
for men who had no other claim than that of being
a relative of a Congressman.
That is the right view to take of the subject, and
if the New York Yacht Club take any other it will
be' less American and less sportsmanlike than Sir
Thomas Lipton. In a contest of this kind the motto
should be, "Let the best yacht win." All comers
should have a fair chance.
, These are purely international races. The English peo
ple do not care what English designer wins so long as
England wins, and so I Judge it to be with the American
people. The yacht which defends the cup does so on be
half of the whole seventy-five millions of people and not
on behalf of the individual owner or designer. "What we
all want Is genuine, true and sportsmanlike contests.
I am sending over the best yacht England can produce,
and I want to meet the best yacht America can produce.
In this connection it is worth noting that Sir
Thomas Lipton is reported, when asked what he 1
thought of the subjec:, to have stated that he would
not like to take the cup back to Great Britain with
the knowledge he had not won it from the best
American yacht. He went on to 'say:
Which of the two views is technically correct may
be a debatable question, but there can be little differ
ence of opinion concerning the two points involved in
it: First, that the New York Yacht Club should at
once decide the question and give notice so as to save
expense to men who are now building yachts in the
expectation of being permitted to compete; second,
that the cup ought to be' defended by the best yacht
America can produce. AH American yachtsmen
should ha\;e a fair chance to win the honor of de
fending it. . -v
; As the challenged body, the New. York Tacht Club
may be in a position to say, If desired, that the defense
of ..the .trophy lies solely in its hands, the honors to be
confined to its own members. On the other hand. It has
been shown that the club holds the cup as temporary
trustee under the terms . originally expressed by its
donors, that it should remain "as a perpetual challenge
cup for friendly competition between foreign countries."
It has been argued that the words "between foreign
countries" suggest that each competing country should
be represented in the best possible way, and that a lim
ited defense which should not exhaust the whole of the
country's inventive talent was thus forbidden.
Lately the affair has been complicated by the
appearance of another set of yacht builders who de
sire the honor of defending the cup against Lipton.
The New York Tribune presents the two sides cf
the question in this form:
the: cup and the club.
SOME time ago we directed attention to a con-_
troversy^in the"^ East over the question whether â¢
any person- outside "of the New York Yacht
Club has a right to^enter a yacht as a. competitor for
the honor of defending the America's cup against the
challenger, Sir Thomas Lipton. .The question arose
from the fact that Mr. Lawson of Boston is building
a yacht for that purpose, and it has been suggested
that should his yacht win he^ will hold the cup an i
take it to Boston. To that the New YorkYach:
Club objected and the issue has been a matter of
controversy ever since.

Value of College Sports.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler's en
thusiasm over college athletics Is fully
Justified by the facts. It Is undoubtedly
true that "athletics have done a very
great deal for our college men." that they
do supplement mental culture with a
necessary physical culture, and that It
Is the element of sport and competition
that gives them their value. No amount
of merely perfunctory exercise would fur
nish an adequate substitute.â Chicago

Knighted Americans.
"Sir" Hiram Maxim sounds strangely.
Sir Hiram's efficient machine runs, used
In South Africa, won him his knighthood.
Some surprise has been expressed by
Americans In London that ho should ac
cept a title, fof he has always been a fer
vent and spretd-eagle type of patriot and
declared frequently that the "United
States was good enough for him." Queen
Victoria, during her reign, has knighted
three Americans. The first was Curtis
Miranda Laropson, a native of Vermont,
who was made a baronet In 1S66 in token
of his services in connection with the lay

German Pensions.
We may get some notion of the great
liberality of our military pension legisla
tion by comparison of it with the propo
sition of the law which the German Impe-Â»
rial Government refused to sanction. Re
ce/itly in the Reich3tag a resolution to
amend the pension law so that every sol
dier of the wars of '64. . '63 and '70, by
which the German empire as it exists was
made possible, who is an invalid and un
able to support himself, would receive an
nually 120 marks (28 56). was debated. Rep
resentatives of all parties were favorable,
and censured the Government for its
neglect to provide pensions for the impov
erished men whose service had made the
nation secure and splendid. The sum pro
posed seems to us a mere pittance, but,
meager as it is. It is unlikely to be grant

Tesla, the Proxniser.
Wizard Nikola Tesla is the great prom
lser In the science of astronomy. He is an
earnest and conscientious student, but his
weakness lies In the constant prophesy
ing of marvels that never materialize.
Just now he is convinced that he is about
to hold animated converse with the inhab
itants of Mars, and his admirers, who are
patient, are willing to give him every
chance to prove the correctness of his the
ories. Scientists of repute, to put it frank
ly, would have more faith In Mr. Tesla if
he accomplished more and talked a little
less. We should be Interested, for exam
ple. In knowing what M. Camllle Flam
marion, than whom a more wondrous as
trologer does not exist and who unites a
profound scientific knowledge with a most
exquisite and beautiful imagination,

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
We are making great and costljr strides in the build
ing of a mighty navy." No people has had a" navy
without- deep water commerce. , A glance at nav.il
statistics shows that the navies of nations are in pro
portion to their merchant marine. Carthage aroused
the fear and cupidity of Rome by putting a navy be
hind her merchant marine. The \Hanseatic League
supported its merchant ships with warships. In pur
suance.of the same law England has the greatest ex
isting merchant marine and the, greatest navy. Now
it will be a! folly and "a farce to spend hundreds of
millions in creating a great navy\ to sail around- the
world nowhere' saluting the American flag on a mer
chant, ship. " The two go together,: and the people
will soon tire of supporting a great navy unless they
have a proportionately great merchant marine.
As for the .general policy; of restoring American
shipping, the bill now before Congress proposes the
only logical course. The people . protection
as. the fairly , well settled policy of the country. - As
long as it is the- policy: there is no other way oi
sending to the world the ; surplus it â¢ produces in
American . ships. . â¢ .
increases the proportion of American sailors required
in the" crews. We want to restore the sea-going char
acter of the . American ? people which has strangely
lapsed. .;â¢' This"; country has more miles of sea and lake
coast and more of navigable rivers than any other
country in the world. Its people should find profit
able employment on river, lake and ocean. Partial
prosperity is no prosperity at all. Prosperity must
be general to be beneficial to a country. We want
no. plan that will. confine prosperity to classes. .In
this matter ship-builder, sailor "and ship-owner must
share and share alike, each in proportion to his con
tribution of brain and muscle.
As men everywhere have watched her ebbing life
they have felt that touch of nature which is in us all
at the spectacle of a family, sons and daughters,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, in sorrow and
grief. As the glory of the world fades to her vision
it is not royalty that is passing â it is a mother, a
widow, dying. All the pomp and circumstance of
state, the insignia of royalty, the stamp of princely
dignity and display, are seen in their impermanencc
as but the mask and trappings of life's passing fashion,
and the sympathy and sorrow, the sentiment and tears,
are given in tribute to that character which she held
and honored in* common with : every good mother
who has felt the thrill of her first baby's kiss and has
shared with this mother, Queen and Empress all the
joys and sorrows that paint life's page with the chang
ing sunshine and shadows.
The world hailed and knew her as the Mother
Queen. Those who have read her published diary
have found in it no literary form to be praised, no
originality to be flattered, but they have respected the
mother spirit that makes its charm. \ .
She has been the one moral influence respected
by EuYopean royalty. Much criticized often for her
ideal of a vestal court, for her stern and inflexible
morality, yet in these respects she has stood for the
pure home everywhere, and high and humble all over
the globe have felt the high influence of her upright
example. Her" sons and daughters, after all but men
and women, have loved or feared the strength of her
morality, and while none can claim that the men of
her house have not deserved her displeasure, they
never ceased to dread it. The excesses of George IV,
in the court of her grandfather, have not been appar-
In part this has its origin in the respect of .the
world for womanhood. This was shown by the re
sentment of Irishmen when she was lampooned last
year by the Paris : press. -Though they were the
hereditary enemies of her dynasty and her nation,
the Irish heart remembered that she was a woman,
and its hot blod leaped in retaliation of the Gallic
insult. That England had a Queen instead of a King
has served that nation in many a crisis. The Chartist
agitation, the corn law riots, the home rule crisis and
the pinch and stress of war and tumult have all been
limited and bounded by respect for the clean skirts of
the woman who held the scepter. ;-..,,
But not before in more than a century has the
passing^of one stirred the sympathy of widely separ
ated peoples to an equal degree.
sentiment to the dead.
THE whole world is profoundly impressed dur T
ing the closing hours of the life of Victoria,' the
Queen and Empress. During her reigri Kings,
Czars and Emperors have passed away. Princes and
Presidents have fallen before the assassin. Nation*
have mourned their rulers, and far people have paused
for a moment in life's hard march to pay the tribute of

REPAIRS to vessels Injured In tho
recent southeaster are now
nearly completed, and some of
the ships and schooners are
' again ready for sea. The British
â¢hlr Flintshire Is remasted and will
sail for England again to-morrow. Her
yards and rigging are modeled after the
"Yankee" pattern, and If Is to be hopeu
that she will have better luck on her next
venture.
The Flintshire left here lost December
for Europe. Pilot Scott took her out and
when he was oft the Farallones It came
on to blow a hurricane. For a time It
looked as though the pilot was going to
be carried to Europe, but off l'ort Harford
the oil steamer George Loomis was sight
ed and the pilot put aboard her. Then
Captain Jones set his course for England.
Another storm came up. however, and a
eudden squall dismasted the ship. She
came back to Ban Francisco under a jury
rip and for the last month has been In the
hands of the riggers. The hull has been
liiapt-cted by Lloyd's representatives and
pronounced perfectly sound.
The remainder of the foreign fleet does
not appear to have fared as well as the
Flintshire. The Wraihaown, now out 113
days from Yokohama for Portland, is un
ir.surable. Even 93 per cent falls to tempt
the reinsurance gamblers. The Andrada,
from Santa Rosalia for Portland, which
showed up off. the Columbia River and
took a pilot aboard a montu ago, is now
being reinsured at a rate of 90 per cent.
The Bertha 1b now out ninety days from
Welhalwel for Astoria, and 85 per cent Is
being paid on her. The Otto Glldermelster
Is out sixty-eight days from Yokohama
for the Columbia River, and 85 per cent
Is being paid on her chances. The Castle
Rock Is eighty-eight days out from Hong
kong for Victoria, B. C. and the Cape
Wrath eighty days from Callao for Asto
ria. On both of them 85 per cent is beln;?
paid. The Cape Wrath was reported off
the Columbia River over a week ago, but
ehe disappeared, and the reinsurance on
her is again quoted.
The underwriters fear that all these ves
sels were caught in the great southeaster
and either driven out to sea or on borne
unfriendly shore.

multiply the length and breadth and
thickness togetherâ that Is, 6x6x4, which
gives us 144. The student will note then
that a foot of lumber is 144 cubic inches
of lumber, no matter what shape tha
wood may be.
In the following: exercises only flat sur
faces are considered. All the boards may
be taken as only one inch thick.
1. How many feet of lumber In an Inch
board 10 feet long by 8 Inches wide?
A foot of lumber Is a solid containing
144 cubic Inches. A piece of board a foot
square and an inch thick Is said to be a
board foot. If cut into four equal pieces
and these are placed on top of each other
so as to make a black 6 Inches square and
4 Inches thick It is still a board foot. To
find the solid contents of such a block we

Franclaco Bay. Published by official au
thority of the Superintendent.
NOTEâ The high and low waters occur at the
city front (Mission-street wharf) about twenty
flve minutes later than at Fort Point; the
height of tide Is the same at both places.
Ncte â The buyer In Portland must pay more
than the face value of the draft. This would
indicate that the Portland banks are- issuing
more drafts on New York than tho New York
banks are issuing on Portland. When the dif
ference is nettled It is settled In actual cash,
and to send cash across the continent costs
money; hence the premium on the draft.
Noteâ To make the proper entries here It is
necessary to find the present worth of these
notes The bill receivable is worth $335 and
the bill payable is trorth S19S0. (1) Credit the
Him account with J1CC0 and charge to bills re
ceivable; charge the firm account with Si and
credit intereFt or discount. (2) Charge the
Itrm account with $2C0O and credit bills pay
able; credit the firm account with 120 and
charge to interest or discount. To show the
actual gain or loss on interost and discount
iu any particular period the present worth of
notes must be considered both at commencing
and closing. .
XXXIII.â HOW TO FIGURE EX
CHANGE.
The system by which merchants In dis
tant places discharge their debts to each
other without the transmission of actual
money Is called exchange. A draft or bill
of exchange is an order written by ons
person or bank, directing a second person
or bank to pay a specified sum to a third
person. Bills of exchange are negotiable
or non-negotiable upon the same condi
tions and are usually subject to the same
indorsements as promissory notes. The
face or par of a bill of exchange is the
sum expressed therein;. It Is the original
obligation, exclusive of Interest, premium,
discount, etc. Exchange on England la
usually quoted by glying the value of Â£1
in dollars and cents.
The arithmetic of exchange is very sim
ilar to any other arithmetic Involving the
principles of percentage. Try the follow
ing examples: Â¦
1. What is the cost In Portland, Ore.,
of a draft on New York for $2500 at *4
per cent premium?
7. When opening a set of books Jan
uary 1, 11*01, you Hnd among the resources
a note for S1000 made In 1S00 due. Febru
ary 1, and among the liabilities you find
a note for $2000 made In 1900 and due
March 1. Consider money worth 6 per
cent and make the proper entries of these
two Items.
Noteâ In the first place you cannot males a
r-trfect balance sheet. The sides will not bal
ciice. This omission of this account will not
affect your losses or gains aa shown by your
broks. Of course if you forget the account
forever the loss must appear. The omission
will reduce your resources $3oO.
G. â¢ In making up your balance sheet you
forget entirely an account in your favor
of WOO. Will this affect (1) your state
ment of losses and gains; (2) your state
ment of resources and liabilities?
Noteâ Cash is credited with $2C0 and A. s
personal account In the firm ledger Is charged
Â¦with $200. This will show that A owes the
business $300.
5. Your firm issues a check to pay a
note of $200, which A, one of the partners
of the firm, owes. What entries?
Note â The 11000 appears on the credit side of
bills payable. Enter $1000 on the charge side
and credit B. The*old note is now paid and
an account of $10CO is created In B's favor.
Credit this account (B's) with Interest $10
and charge to the interest account, which
shows that you have lost $10 on interest. You
row pay this account of 41010 which is due B.
Cssh Is credited with $100 and bills payable
with $610 and both Items are charged to B.
4. You owe B J1000 on a notÂ© due to
day. You pay him cash $400 and give him
a new note for $610, tho $10 being added
for -interest. What entries?
Noteâ Charge $10 in your cash account and
credit your interest account with the same
amount.
S. Tour bank has given you credit In
your bankbook with an item of S10 al
lowed as Interest on your account. What
entries?
I.'oteâ Wnen the sal* is made merchandise is
credited and Brown Is charged in the ledger
with J100. When the bill Is paid we enter $100
on the charge side of the cash book and credit
Brown with the same amount. This closes up
Brown's account. "We enter $3 on the credit
side of the cash book and charge discount
with the same amount.
(Concluding Lesson).
1- Bought goods Invoiced at J763.W ariÂ«t
paid for same by check. Paid my note
due to-day by certified check.
Noteâ A certified check Is a check certified as
rood by the bank. If you wish to use your
check to pay a note due at some other fcanlc
than your own, or in buying real estate or
stock* or bonds, you may find it necessary to
get the check certified. This Is done by an
of fleer of the bank, 'who write* or stamp*
across the face of the check the words "Cer
tified" or "Good when property Indorsed" and
signs his name. Tho amount will immediately
be deducted from your account, and the bank,
l;y guaranteeing payment, becomes wholly re
sponsible for the genuineness of the check.
Ii you should get a check certified and then
rot use it deposit it in your bank; otherwise
your account will be short the amount tor
which it la drawn,
2. Brown bought merchandise Invoiced
at $100 on thirty days' credit A week
later he pays the bill In cash and we al
low him our cash discount of 2 per cent.

THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
A CALL CARICATURIST TAKES "PENCIL SHOTS" WHILE. ENERGETIC MEN WITH HANDBALL MITTS TRY
TO ANNIHILATE A LITTLE BALL IN AN ENDEAVOR TO WIN FAME AND TROPHIES AT THE OLYMPIC
CLUB TOURNAMENT.
"W. Kennedy, Jack Gleason. Tom Ken
nedy and Robert Bowman were dropped
out, each having lost two games.
Â£sÂ«r|Â«^ HERE was enthusiasm among the
Â¦ devotees of handball at the Olym-
I pic, Club last night. The tourna
11 ment now on at the well-known
Post-street athletic institution is
drawing to a close and the games are
growing more exciting-.
George James and Henry Russ contested
last evening and played the best "rubber"
so far seen in the tournament. James
won the first game by a score of 21 to 3.
Rubs possesses weak eyes, and the shad
ows thrown on the court played havoc
with them. In the second game he picked
up and played brilliant ball. He made
many circus "takes" of James' backwa'l
toss, and when serving stood close to the
left wall and sent out a low ball that went
past James with the speed of a bullet.
Russ made it game and game by a score
of 21 to 16. The third and deciding game
aroused enthusiasm among the spectators.
James' strength and condition began to
coupled with Phil Newman's speedy serve,
led to his defeat. Newman won both
games. Score: 21â11, 21â13. "Bobby"
Bowman bowed In defeat to A. Duffy.
Score: 21â16. 21â16.
The semi-finals will be played to-mor
row night.- Butz plays Newman, and
Duffy will play Russ. The winners will be
pitted against Cartwright and James in
me finals on Friday evening.
The following table shows the standing
of the players in the tournament:
tell. He solved Russ' difficult "toss" and
sent the little ball back at all angles.
There were long rallies and clever returns.
Russ led by two points, but when he
reached thirteen James spurted and made
it "up sticks." James continued his
strong playinpr and, after the hardest kind
of work, won by a score of 21 to 16. At
the end of the close struggle their club
mates rose up and yelled approval.
James McElroy. the gamekeeper, wiped
his brow and settled down to keep tab on
the play of the henvy swlpers, Kred Butz
and "Bill" Cartwright. The game re
solvrd itpelf down to this: the man with
the hardest "toss" won. Cartwrlght not
only had a deceptive drive, Dut he pos
sessed a good left "mitt," and won two
straight games. Butz's toss was no less
difficult to return, but Cartwrlght was
equal to the occasion. Both games were
full of vim and interesting-. Score: Cart
wright. 21, 21; Butz. 14, 11.

as at present. In that event we can then
release our embargo on p.ool selling. I
do not think it fair that racing should be
allowed in adjoining counties and be for
bidden here."
"The Police Committee," concluded
Tobin, "believes that the oply fair solu
tion to all interested parties is the re
striction of racing to a limited period."
"The adoption of this resolution," said
McCarthy, "would place us in a peculiar
position. It will certainly make this
board look ridiculous if it should ask the
Legislature to encourage horse racing for
thirty days when under our own ordi
nances we do not encourage It for thirty
minutes. I am not in favor of petitioning
the Legislature to do something we do not
ourselves countenance."
Provided, however, that nothing in
such general laws shall prevent the
passage by any city or county of laws
or ordinances preventing the selling
of pools at all times.
In explaining^ the purport of the reso
lution Tobln gave it as his opinion that
the only way to put a stop to the in
discriminate selling of pools was the pass
age of a general law restricting the period
during which racing may be held. He
contended that racing as at present car
ried on in contiguous counties is a great
drain on the resources of this community
nnd the long season encouraged gambling
and increased the moral depravity of the
city.

this State during one year.
Resolved, That the clerk of this board fur

lution to the President of the Senate, the
Speaker of the Assembly and the chairman
of the San Francisco delegation, requesting in
behalf of this board that they give the mat

When^Tpbin had concluded and the
Mayor had come to Dwyer's assistance
by informing him that the object of the
act was to shut down excessive periods of
racing in San Mateo and Oakland. Dwyer
said a few words In his own behalf
_ 'I am only an ordinary painter," said
Dwyer, "and I am without the legal learn
ing of the gentleman who has seen fit to
criticise my action. I think, however tha*
common courtesy and decency, which the
position on this board entitles one Super
visor to expect from another, should have
prompted him to jrive me at least a civil
reply, for I spoke in good faith."

some one desjred to know the purport of
the amendment Comte thundered forth*
"It will show that under the charter 'of
this city we are able to exercise the sov
ereignty of self-government; that we will
restrict for ourselves, and upon our own
responsibility, anything that we Consider
harmful.
The resolution was then adopted by the
following vote: Â¦

Comte D'Ancona,, Fontana. Jennings, Reed!
Stafford. Tobin and Wilson. Â«Â«*Â«.
Noesâ Connor. Dwyer and McCarthy.

I would as soon vote to open Ingleslde as
to vote for this resolution, for it practi
cally means the same thing. If such an
act is passed you will have racing In Sau
sallto, which will give you four months'
racing instead of ninety days'. I do not
propose to deed away my power to the
members of the Legislature, for the pass
age of this resolution will be a virtual
surrender of our prerogatives."
At this point Dwyer asked leave to put
a question to Tobin.
Resolved, That it Is the â¢entiment of this
board that horse racing and pool selling within
the enclosure of a race track should not be
permitted to take place for a longer period
than thirty dayÂ» In any one county within this
State during the. period of one year.
Resolved, That thÂ« Legislature of the State
of California now In session be most respect
fully and earnestly requested to pass an act
limiting- such horse racing and pool selling to a.
Close upon the defeat of the foregoing
resolution came the adoption of another
one to memorialize the Legislature to
pass an act limiting horse racing to thirty
days in one year in each city and county.
The resolution, however, did not pass un
til an amendment Introduced by Comte
was attached thereto wnlch will practical
ly render nugatory any general law legal
izing horse racing, a3 it reserves to each
city and county the right to prohibit pool
selling at all times. The force of the
amendment is apparent, sinco it is well
known that horse racing without pool
selling is unprofitable.
The resolutions in full, including
Comte's amendment, follow:
The board acquiesced In the recom
mendation of the Police Committee that
the resolution be indefinitely postponed
without any discussion. Chairman Tobin
explained that it was feared by the com
mittee that the general law legalizing pool
selling would conflict with the local
ordinance now on the municipal statute
book prohibiting the selling of pools in
this city and county. After McCarthy
had explained that he had introduced the
resolution at the request of several citi
zens of Sausallto Lhe measure was rele
gated to oblivion without further com
ment.
The Board of Supervisors by a unani
mous vote yesterday placed its seal of
disapproval on McCarthy's resolution pro
viding for the approval by the board of
the Belshaw act now before the Legis
lature, which is designed to prohibit the
selling of pools and bookmaklng on any
kind of contest, except .within the race
track inclosure or building or fair ground
where the contest lakes place.
Request Legislature to Limit Horse Racing to Thirty Days, but
Reserve Right to Prohibit Gambling Thereon.

"The truth of the matter Is the action
of the council of administration is both
without precedent and entirely unten
able." paid George C. Cook, who acted as
spokesman for the Denver delegation.
"The different State departments will
probably take up this matter and decide
'whether they will still adhere to their
unanimous action at Chicago In favor of
Denver for the encampment September
next."
"The procuring of the one-cent-a-mlle*
rate for Denver has been accomplished
much earlier than ever before, and in
territory where the rate has never before
been made. The Denver committee feels
it has fully complied with the regula
tions of the national encampment at Chi
cago and is entitled to the meeting this
year, and It Is well advised that the
sentiment of the Grand Army throughout
the country Is favorable to Denver.
"The national encampment of the G.
A. R. at Chicago last year voted unani
mously to hold the encampment in Den
ver this year provided the railroads lead
ing thereto granted a rate of one cent
a mile. The Denver committee filed to
day with the commander-ln-chief and the
executive committee the notice by Chair
man McLeod of the Western Passenger
association, promulgating the one-cent
per-mile rate on the shortest mileage of
all thf> principal railroads leading to Den
ver from St. Louis, Chicago, St. Paul and
all Missouri River points. This, rate has
been promulgated for the Denver G. A.
R. encampment by railroads and connect
ing lines covering more than 50,000 miles
of lines leading to Denver.
The meeting of the council held to-day
was the result of the failure of Denver
to satisfy the council at its December
meeting of the city's ability to meet the
requirements of a one-cent-per-mile rail
road rate. Cleveland, Pittsburg and Den
ver sent delegations to to-day's meeting
to plead for the sending of the encamp
ment to their cities. The Cleveland dele
gation offered the written pledge of the
chairman of the Central Passenger Asso
ciation for a rate of one cent per mile to
the encampment; promised to raise the
necessary money to meet the expenses of
the encampment, offered free quarters in
100 schoolhouses for the old soldiers,
agreed to arrange the line of march to
suit, and produced written pledges. The
delegation representing Plttsburg, too,
pledged a one-cent rate, hotel accommo
dations, subscriptions and met the other
requirements of the encampment. Den
ver's applicants for encampment honors
produced letters from Chairman McLeod
of the Western Passenger Association,
promising the one-cent rate on six rail
roads. In addition, they made the neces*
sary promises as to accommodations and
entertainment. The written pledge of
Chairman McLeod, they claimed, met all
the requirements of the resolutions re
gardlng rates adopted In Chicago at the
thirty-fourth annual encampment. Half:
an hour's discussion resulted In the selec
tion of Cleveland, the vote being 1 five for
Cleveland, two for Denver and one for
Pittsburg. The Denver committee at once
held a secret meeting.
That they were disappointed and angry
over the outcome of their efforts to se
cure the encampment for Denver waa
plainly expressed. At the end of a half
hour's deliberation the following state
ment was prepared:
As a result of this action representa
tives of Denver Indicated that they in
tended to. take up the matter with the
various State departments and would also
hold an encampment the second week of
September.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 21. â Cleveland was to
day selected by the Council of Adminis
tration of the Grand Army of the Re
public for the next annual encampment,
to be held the week of September 9, 1S01.
"It is certain that if they do have an
encampment it will not be the national
encampment of the G. A. R.," was the
manner In which one dismissed tha sub
ject.
It Is said that Individual members of
the council were unwilling to di3cus<Â» tha
"manifesto." as they termed the docu
ment issued by Denver. They declared
the Denver people were mistaken when
they thought they had the promise of the
Pennsylvania and Xew York departments
to. so to Denver, and were certain that
none of the departments would refuse to
attend the encampment at Cleveland.
Commander in Chief Rassteur was
handed a copy of the statement Issued by
the Denver committee. Before reading It
he called the committee together, ex
plained that the statement was in exist
ence, and then read It.
The contents of the document produced
some little feeling of momentary charac
ter, which resulted In the council consid
ering the question behind closed doora
Ten minutes later the following was given
out by Commander Rassieur. speaking for
end with the sanction of the council*
"I have Just read what you inform ma
emanates from the comrades representing
Denver. It Is hard to believe that such a
statement emanates from a good Grand
Army comrade. Assuming that It does I
desire simply to state that the executive
committee, with the light before it and
after having given Denver two hearings
and weighing everything presented by it
decided that the next encampment of the
Grand Army should be held at Cleveland
Ohio. September 9. 190L At that encamp-'
ment this committee will report the facts
which led them to the action taken and
every Grand Army comrade will doubtless
heartily approve of that action. We have
endeavored to do what is best for tha
Grand Army and in compliance with the
ection of the thirty-fourth national en
campment, notwithstanding the statement
made which. It la said, emanates from tha
Denver comrades."
The work of endeavoring to win over
the various departments east of the
Mississippi River will be commenced at
once, so the Denver committee stated to
night.
#r We have, as stated In that document. Â«e
cured the one-cent rate on all trunk lines
from the Mississippi River points. That
includes all the lines from Chicago, St.
Louis and St. Paul, something that has
been sought for on other occasions and
never been secured. We did not. it is
true, secure a written pledge from a num
ber of minor lines running into the city,
but when one considers that we have thu
Chicago and Alton, the Burlington, the
W abash, Missouri Pacific, Union Pacific.
Rock Island, the Santa Fe and the St.
Louis and San Francisco, you can read
ily see that we have all the lines that
would carry any passengers from th<?
East. The other lines will be bound to
fall In line, and with the Influence we
could bring to bear when it was seen that
the encampment was coming- to Denver
there would not have been the slightest
doubt of success in that line. The fact
that the other requirements were met en
tirely to the satisfaction of the council
shows that on the railroad matter alone
hung any excuse for our failure. These
rates will be allowed to stand, however,
and the committee says there will be an
encampment In Denver this fall. The
Pennsylvania department as well as that
of Xew York has stated that It Intends
coming to Denver and so have other
States. The matter has not ended with
to-day's decision, for It wrlll be taken up
by the committee with the State depart
ments at once."

REDWOOD Cli X". Jan. -21.â The agita
tion against unlimited horse-racing In the
county of San Mateo,. which was begun
and continued persistently by the best cit
izens of the county, reached a conclusion
to-day' in the adoption of a restrictive or
dinance by the Board of Supervisors. By
authority of this ordinance horse-racing
in the county of San Mateo must be lim
ited, on and after February 5, 1901, to a
period of thirty-five days In each year.
The ordinance states specifically that
there is no purpose to harm legitimate
sport, which is conducive to the breeding
of good horses and not unhealthful to the
community at large. The ordinance does
aim, however, at gambling, which Is pro
ductive of many evils. The new law of
th'e county adopted to-day prohibits any
person, firm, partnership, association or
corporation, operating within or â¢without
an inclosure, to give, permit or conduct
horse races for a purse, stake, prize, re
ward or premium for a period longer than
thirty-five days. Â¦Â»
The law also prohibits any person, firm,
partnership, association or corporation
from allowing any one else to do what It
cannot do under the law. The penalties
for violation of the ordinance are a con
viction of misdemeanor, a fine of not more
than $500. Imprisonment for six months, or
both fine and Imprisonment. The ordin
ance will become operative fifteen days
after its adoption, or on February o. 1901.
For the purposes of the ordinance the
year shall be considered to begin on the
day when the new law shall take effect.
The new law Is In full as follows:
. ORDINANCE NO. 168.
Relative to horse races, horse race meetings
and contests of Bpeed or endurance between
horses for any purse-, ctake, prize, reward or
premium, and limiting the time during which
the same may take place.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Supervisors Restrict the Game to Thir
ty-Five Days in a Year.
Whereas. Horse racing properly conducted
during a limited period of time each year en
courages the breeding of fast horses, and the
breeding thereof 13 of material benefit to the
State; and
Whereas. Unlimited bnrse racing merely en
genders the love of gambling, which results In
crimes and evils of many kinds:
Xoxr, therefore. The Board of Supervisors of
the county of San Mateo dr> ordain as follows:
Section 1â It shall be unlawful for any per
son, firm, partnership, association, corporation
or Individual, at any place within the county
of San Mateo. State of California, either within
or Â¦without the lnclosure of a race track, park
or grounds, to hold or give or permit or con

for any purse, stake, prize, rewari or premium
for any period of time longer than thlrty-flvÂ»
(Â£5) dayÂ» in or during any year, la the county
cf San Mateo. State of California.
Section 2 â It shall be unlawful for any pep
son, firm, Individual, corporation or associa
tion owning or operating or conducting or la
control of any race track, park or inelosure
within the limits of the county of San Mateo.
State of California, whereon races hare been
held during any year for the time permitted
by this ordinance, to thereafter during Â»uch
year permit or suffer or allow any other per

to hold, conduct. mant;e, carry on or take
pctrt In any horse race or any contest of speed
or endurance or race between horses for any
purse, itake, prize, reward or premium within
said race track, park or lnclosure.
Section aâ Any person, firm, association, cor
poration or Individual violating any of the pr->
visions of this ordinance shall be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars, or Imprisonment
In the County Jail of ths county of San Mateo,
State of California, not exceeding six months,
or by both such fine and imprisonment.
Section 4â All ordinances and parts of ordi
nances in conflict with any of the provisions
of this ordinance are hereby repealed.
Section S â The year above mentioned shall
commence annually on the date whereon this
ordinance takes effect.
Section 8â This ordinance shall take effect

"â ~ iMANILA. Jan. 21.-The act establishing
the Department of Public Instruction was
unanimously passed by the Philippine
Commission to-day, after a debate.be
tween Commissioner Mosc f ff , a " d rpl f"^
Taft over the section permitting religious
instruction In schoolhousea.
The Commissioners were In favor of the
section originally but Commissioner
>i nsM became convinced lt^as not wise
concerning the separation of churcn ana
BUte K the "questionable provision" were
InaSed. The 'commissioner elÂ»ngtertÂ«d
FChwls unless religious instruction were
Ss?w^s Inadvisable when one of the par.
ties was predisposed against a compro-
m judKe Taft offered a substitute permit
ting teaching thrice weekly by priests and
ministers to pupils whose parents desired
that their children receive such instruc
tion and prescribing the dismissal of
teachers who attempt to nfluence pupils
religiously and the suspension of the privi
leges of priests and ministers whose teach
ings create disloyalty or disorder.
Concerning the alleged disobedience of
the administration's Instructions, Ju&ze
Taft said the question would be whether
such use of school buildings would involve
a tax on the peonle. He cited the facts
that the school buildings in use were being
used for political and religious purposes,
notwithstanding the opposing attitude pf
the Federal party leaders. The Judge said
he did not believe a majority of the party
or of the people were opposed to it. He
believed the opposition was caused chiefly
by fear of ecclesiastical control. The
Judge did not believe the hierarchy of
the church would approve of the radical
propositions of the Central Catholics. If
experience proved the wisdom of repeal
ing the section it would at least be after
the Government had shown that it is
neither Protestant nor pro-Cattolic.
Commissioner Ide voted with Commis
sioner Moses asralnst Judge Taft. on the
substitute, explaining that he questioned
whether the substitute would accomplish
the purpose sought.
After the adoption of Commissioner
Moses* amendment the bill was unani
mously passed.

Superintendent Jones and Resident En
gineer Robinson made a careful investi
gation to determine the cause of the acci
dent. The track was found in good con
dition; the tie was plated and the rail not
worn. The gauge was all right. In the
opinion of the superintendent the derail
ment undoubtedly was due to a defect In
the car first leaving the tracks. .The car
belonged to- the Cudahy Company.
The tunnel was cleared at 6 o'clock to
nleht, when the three belated passenger
trains were allowed to go through.
The train, which was" east bound, was
going at moderate speed when the fourth
car from the engine left the rails. The
remainder of the train followed It. The
engine was stopped as soon as possible
and word was sent to Truckee for a
wrecking crew. It arrived at daybreak.
Tho-work of clearing the track was slow,
owing to the limited amount of working
space In the tunnel.

shareholders, was organized, but ere this
body had begun its work there was a
proposition to absorb the Central by the
Southern Pacific.
"The total number of English shares In
the Central Pacific was 377.000. The prop

to do. I believe we have a good case and
I do not propose to let the matter drop

Chloroform is not the proper thing to

Such is the opinion of Autopsy Surgeon

chloroform administered by Dr. J. H.
Healy at the College of Physicians and

Dr. Bacigalupl said that McGoniglo was
In a bad way. Not only was his heart
weak but he had cirrhosis of the liver and
diseased kidneys. The chloroform was
what killed him.
The Jury returned a verdict that Mc-
Gonlgle died of heart disease, the con

ANNUAL MEETING
an acrltation against the conduct of the
company in press. The London Times and
the leading financial papers of England
took it up and scored the American road
most severely. In October. 1S94, Hunting
ton was forced to act.
"The Speyers got together four promi
nent stock exchange men. They were F.
G. Banbury. Lord Alden Compton, J. B.
Ackroyd and Daniel Manks. Then the
Speyers wrote a note to me, asking me to
become a member of the committee. I
accepted with the understanding that Jo
seph Price and the late Mr. Peevas should
also be made members. The committee
held several meetings, but suddenly 1
found myself quite alone in the move for
a thorough Investigation of the Central
Pacific Company's affairs.
"In 1897 I succeeded in getting another
Investigating committee appointed. It
was headed by C. S. Fairchlld of. New

JURY CENSURES
THE DOCTORS
IF all that "Walter Morshead has to
eay about the Southern Pacific Com
pany's alleged trickery and crooked
ness is true there will be some sensa
tional exposures ere the English
stockholder Is through airing his griev
ances against the big corporation. As an
nounced in yesterday's Call, Morshead
has come to San Francisco to projss an
old complaint against the companyâ a
complaint which its author considers well
founded, but one which he ha-Â« heretofore
had preat difficulty In bringing to an Issue
for the reason that, as Morshead claims,
the men whom he had Interested would
Invariably and without any apparent rea
son suddenly chance their minds and drop
all Interest In the proceedings. The griev
ances of Morshead and his English friends
may be summed up in a single point,
namely, that a railroad corporation has
no legal right to absorb the stock of an
other railroad when such transaction is to
the great detriment of the stockholders
of the road absorbed.
That the Southern Pacifie has violated
the above rule, absorbing the Central Pa
cific, Morshead says he will show when
the case comes to trial. He intends to
show further that not only was the ab
sorption of the Central Pacific by the
Southern Pacific effected to the detriment
of the Central Pacific stockholders, but
that the deal was carried on In an illegral
manner, and he further alleges that the
English stockholders were induced to
place their shares upon the market
through misrepresentation and by other
devious methods.
The English syndicate which Morshead
represents has retained local counsel and
it is proposed to push thÂ£ case -without
further delay. The two bills now pending
before Judge Morrow will be strength
ened by supplementary bills which are
being prepared, and which will be filed
Immediately upon the return of Morshead
from Portland, where he goes to-day 'on
matters pertaining to the case.
Just why Morshead should make use of
the recent sale of $10,000,000 of Southern
Pacific bonds as a basis for his renewed
complaint officials of the company are at
a loss to explain. "It's a hook upon
which untruthful scandals may be hung,"
is the way one Southern Pacific official
summed up the case yesterday. Then he
added:
"That $10,000,000 issue has been over
subscribed long ago, yet Morshead comes
forward with a circular warning: the pub
lic not to subscribe. To me the circular
reads like an embellished innuendo. If
Morshead owned any stock of the Central
Pacific he had every opportunity to get
the same as the other shareholders. Eacl"
stockholder was given his choice of ac
cepting so much per share for the Central
Pacific stock or taking a corresponding
number of shares In the Southern Pacific
Company.
"I fall to see where there was anything
crooked about that proposition. There
were several English stockholders who al
ways opposed the majority when tha Cen
tral Pacific was In existence. They used
to glory in being in the 'waspish* minor
ity. I am of the opinion that it Is the
same crowd who are now trying to stir up
a breeze and make out a case."
President Hays read The Call article
with considerable Interest.
"It is ail Greek to me," he remarked,
"no I would not attempt to speak on the
matter until I am better informed. It
seems to me. though, as if the reference
to the recent Issue of $10,000,000 was *ot
Â«>lgn to Mr. Morshead's grievance. Per
haps he may have good cause for action,
but of course as to that I am not now pre
pared to state."
Morshead claims that the English
shareholders in the Central Pacific were
never properly treated.
"Bogus 2 per cent dividends were given
them." he says, "by the late Collis P.
Huntington. In 1S94 we had an alteration
lease thrown at our heads. I then led
Walter Morshead Says That Bogus Dividends Were Issued

The taint of decaying particles
of food is absolute poison.
All manner of extravagant expressions are possible when
a woman's nerves are overwrought.
The spasm at the top of the wind pipe or bronchial tubes,
"ball rising in the throat/' violent beating of the heart,
laughing and crying by turns, muscular spasms (throwing
the arms about), frightened by the most insignificant occur-
rencesâ are all symptoms of a hysterical condition and se-
rious derangement of the female organs.
Any female complaint may produce hysterics, which
must be regarded as a symptom onlj. The cause, however,
yields quickly to Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, which acts at once upon the organ afflicted and the
nerve centers, dispelling effectually all those distressing
symptoms.
Mrs. Lewis Says: "I Feel Like a New Person*
Physically and flentally."
" Dear Mbs. Pinkham : â I wish to speak a good word for Lydia XL
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. For years I had ovarian trouble
and suffered everything from nervousness, severe headache, and pain in
back and abdomen. I had consulted different physicians, but decided to
try your medicine, and I soon found it waa giving me much relief. I con-
tinued its use and now am feeling like a new person, physically and mentally,
and am glad to add one more testimonial to the value of your remedy.*â
Mrs. M. H. Lewis, 210S Valentine Ave., Tremont, New York, N. Y.
Writing to Mrs. Pinkham is the quickest and surest way
to get the right advice about all female troubles. Her ad-
dress is Lynn, Mass. She advises women free. Following
is an instance :
Mrs. Haven's First Letter to Mrs. Pinkham.
" Dear Mbs. Pbtkbax :â I would like your advice in regard to my
troubles. I suffer every month at time of menstruation, and flow so much
and for so long that I become very weak, also get very dizzy. â¢ I am troubled
with a discharge before and after menses, have pains in ovaries so bad some-
times that I can hardly get around, have sore feeling in lower part of bowels,
pain in back, bearing-down feeling, a desire to pass urine frequently, with,
pains in passing it ; have leucorrhcea, headache, fainting spells, and some-
times have hysteria. My blood is not in good condition. Hoping to hear
from you, I am," Mbs. Emu. Haves, 2508 South Ave., Council Blufb, Iowa.
(June 3, 1899.)
Mrs. Haven's Second Letter.
" Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â I wish to express my gratitude for what your
medicine has done for me. I suffered for four years with womb trouble.
Every month I flowed very badly. I got so bad that I could hardly do my
work. Was obliged to sit or lie down the most of the time. I doctored for
a long time, but obtained no relief. I began using your remedies â Lvdia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, Blood Purifier, Sanative Wash
and Liver Pillsâ and now feel like a new woman." â MfiS. :^*^y* Havxx,

NEW TORK. Jan. 21.â The complete recov
ery of the stock market from the rather alarm-
Ing weakness ehown during the early hours of
the trading this morning was an astoundlne
demonstration of recuperative force. The
i;'~j'.;::Te liquidation at the opening was ao
violent aa to give an appearance of eeml
deir.oraMsation In the market, and the selling
was evidently forced by the wiping out of
margin' and tha uncovering cf stop-loss orders.
Yet before thÂ« day closed, the general level
of prices had risen above Saturday, and the
lart hour thewed an urgent and confident buy-
Ing movement on the floor. The early weak
ness was the lcglc&l sequence of the course of
the market laÂ«t week, and the general ap
prehension that a further reaction was in
evitable. In a market in Which extensive long
accounts exist this means that brokers, in
order to protect themselves, call for additional
Â«<ecurlt>' from their customers for the exten
Â»â¢.- n of margins. This discloses many persons
who are unwilling or unable to supply further
margins end who order the sale of their hold
ings, either to take what prcflts are left or
to save looses. The professional bear operators
are able to Judge pretty shrewdly of the prob
able volume of Â«ueh orders. This purely tech
r.lcal influence In the market was reinforced
this morning by the feeling of depression,
common to all the security markets of the
world, over the approaching death of Queen
Victoria. The death of the Queen is not likely
to have a direct Influence on values of securi
ties! either here or abroad, but capital, always
apprehensive over a change in the order of
things, expressed itself by the selling of se?
curlties. In the opening break in prices such
declines were witnessed as 3^4 in St. Paul,

cipal active etocks all through the list. The
flirt element in the rally was the unwieldy
Fhort interest, which stood eagerly waiting to
take profits by buying stocks at the decline.
There was an influential section of the market
also which refused to yield to the depression.
UiFsourt Pacific gave Â»-ay only M and was lm
mdlaxely marked up to a level substantially
above Saturday and held there throughout the
4ay. In the late dealings It rose to 90r4.

and the Wabash Issues shared quite fully in
the strength of Missouri Pacific. Wabash
common rose t%. the preferred 4U. and the
debentures 4^4. The character of the buying
In other parts of the 11m gave the traders
ground for the supposition that a renewed ab
sorption of stocks was roing on by the power
ful backing and financial interests which were
buyera of important stocks before the many
recent rumors of vast consolidation rained
currency. This cawed a fright among the
shorts, and in attempting to get back stocks

CHICAGO, Jan. tLâ May Wheat opened %Q
He to a shade higher at 73*iÂ©74>ic, Liverpool
was the influence, showing an advance in tha
faca of the decline here Saturday, but so much
long Wheat was for sale the first sales were
at widely varying figures, and a moment later
the market touched 74%c. The situation, how
ever, was bullish. World's shipments were
only 6,228,000 bushels, compared with 8,369,000
bushels the week previous. Antwerp reported
the breaking out of the bubonic plague in Ar
gentina and was tald to have bought heavily
of Wheat at Ean Francisco. There was a bet
ter demand (or Flour, and this Imparted
strength to the cash Wheat market. Before- the
opening tt was asserted that fifteen loads had
been taken for export, at prices better than
Saturday's figures. Buying by sold-out bulls
and covering by shorts began at the tap of tha
gong and continued in a moderately active way
to the end, the market advancing with only
fractional checks occasioned by profit-taking.
A decrease of 649,000 bushels helped to sustain
the advance, but the main support came from
the strength of cash Wheat. The amount taken
by exporters was constantly added to until at
the close tha seaboard was claiming 141 loads.
Exports from Western and Northwestern points
aggregated nearly 1,000.000 bushels. May Wheat
during the forenoon rallied to 76Hc. A reaction
to 74\@74Tto then took place, but this was fol
lowed by a further rally to 7&}*c, and the close
was strong. May dosing l@lHo higher.
Corn vrn& moderately active, 'but the range
was narrow. The market early followed Wheat
closely, but the pace later became too fast, and
the market settled back almost entirely on an
Independent basis. The news was hardly as
favorable for the coarser grains as for Wheat.
Cables were easy, receipts graded better and
the 'visible supply Increased 1.111,000 bushels.
Ehorta were tbe best buyers early, and the
trade, except in a few outside deals, was In
local hands all day. Receivers did most of the
selling. March closed firm at He higher.
Oats were moderately active. The market felt
the Wheat strength, but during the afternoon
eased off on selling credited to cn influential
operator. May closed unchanged.
The tendency in the Provision market was
easier. Hog receipts were under the estimate
but prices at the yards, nevertheless, were
weak, and this was reflected by a decline In
Provisions at the opening. Buying by a prom
inent speculator caused a rally later, but it was
not supported, and tha close was easy May
Port- closed 12%c lower. May Lard 2Â«,c downl
and May Ribs 6c depressed. *

WHEATâ Liverpool, Paris and New York
were firmer, and Chicago opened strogner on
better foreign advices, but with renewed liqui
dation at the advance. The market, however,
was thought to be considerably oversold, and
there was persistent selling for some unknown
account. New York, Chicago, Kansas City and
St. Louis all reported a good report demand,
with something like 800,000 bushels taken at
the three latter places, and there was a good
European demand for Flour at St. Louis,
something that has not happened for some
weeks. Liverpool wired that there was" very
littlo Argentine, Russian or Indian Wheat of
fering, and that American was the cheapest.
The American visible supply decreased 643,000
bushels, where an increase had been expected,
and reported plague in the Argentine further
stimulated the market. The world's shipments
for the week were 99,000 Quarters Russian,
79,000 Argentine and 62,000 Australian. It was
reported from Liverpool that the Argentine crop
would be about 2.8S1.0OO tons, of which 2,000,000
would be exported to Rio de Janeiro.

It Is stated authoritatively that the divi

The army corps sent to South . Africa
went to pieces immediately after tt landed,

NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â The City Vigi
lance League held a mass meeting In the
interests of a" better city government to
night in the Metropolitan Temple. Dr.
Parkhurst is the honorary president of
the league. The meeting was the begin
ning of a series for the same purpose to
be field in churches, synagogues, schools,
society rooms, etc. The idea is'to arouse
the religious population for the next
Mayoralty campaign. Wheeler H. Peck
harii, who was thÂ«a principal speaker of
the evening, said In part:
"What haa happened in this city to
make men think* We have a great city.
Through it runs the. proud Fifth avenue,
fined on either Bide with palaces and
splendor. And, if from that point one
will stretch out one's hand on either side,
only at arm's length almost, it would rest
upon' the most horrible and degrading
human miaery. This is due to a great
extent to bad city government for years
past. â
"Just think of it! At "the head of the
party* and at present having the city's
destiny in his hands is a man who never
did anything to bring public notice to
himself, but got tried once for murder.
"Croker denes us to show that he ever
made a' dishonest dollar. I say that If
a lawyer of average ability could put
Croker under cross-examination he .would
be forced to answer. I defy Croker to
show when he ever made an honest dol
lar." Â¦ '
Mr. Peckham said there were many of
the wealthiest and strongest men march-
Ing columns strong to pay tribute to
those '- la power, either to get possession
of things to which they have no right
or else 'to escape blackmail from under
lings. He said it/ was an easy matter
for great corporated Interests - to pay
large sums to the "'boss", in order to get
permission to extort far larger sums from
the public. He said relief never need be
expected so long as these corporations
are allowed to carry on their business as
they please. .

doctor hopes to be able to- ascertain the
exact variety of the fungi that poisoned
the family.
The Morris family has been In consid

One of the little boys has occupied much

some quarters It was thought that the
poisoning of the family might have been
occasioned by other means than mush

and could not prove a satisfactory alibi.
The verdict of the Coroner's Jury charges

tive that can be assigned for the crime is
that Blaukschain was avenging a wrong
to his squaw, whose son was killed years

In 1870 he began his series of inventions
with a eelf-adjustir.g telegraph relay, and
two years later he established a manufac

He perfected the typewriting telegraph,
the telegraph repeater, the telegraphic
switch and annunciator, and other de

MIfs Hinchman then made her way te
her home and told the story of the attack
to her mother and brothers. She was
badly frightened and her narrative was
incoherent, but she eucceeded In telling
them that she recognized the man who
attacked her as George N. Tyler. The
brothers went to the Tyler residence,
after getting others, to assist them, for
the purpose of chastising him, but there
was no response to the knocks and rings
at the doors. Yesterday, however, they
accosted Tyler on the street and gave
him a tongue lashing. * According to Miss
Hinchman his only excuse is that he had
been sick and did not know what he was
doing.
"My daughter baa not recovered from
the fright even now," said Miss Hlnch
man's mother to-night, "and she is almost
a nervous wreck. It was a good thing
for her that the light was thrown on her
face, else she might have been choked
to death. Tyler had been looking for his
wife for several days and there is no tell
ing what he might have done. Of course,
he eaid it -was a mistake and all that, but
I don't s*Â»e what difference that makes.

any way. There Is nothing we can do to
punish him. but I wish we could."

"You'd better run, you co-ward."
Ecreamed Miss Hinchman after the man
as he made off in the darkness.
Tyler, who runs a nursery, has been
having bitter quarrels with his wife late
ly. He has several times threatened to
take her life and last Tuesday his threats
became so realistic that Mrs. Tyler fled
to the house of Mrs. Harry Lippman, cor
ner of Lincoln avenue and Everettistreet.
Tyler watched the house every day\ln the
hope that he might get an interview with
her. Saturday afternoon -he forced his
way Into the Lippman residence and
slashed some of his wife's clothing with
a knife. It was some time before the
women In the house succeeded in pacify
ing the Infuriated man. lie Insisted that
his wife go with him, but she afterward
succeeded In making her escape.

across the street from that of the Llpp

tacked by a man, who jumped out of the
gloom that pervades the neighborhood,
he grabbed her by the throat and choked
her with all his strength, his grasp.tight
ening with every struggle of the young
woman to release herself.
"Now I've got you; now I've got you,"
he kept crying.
While they were struggling Miss Hinch
xnan's face was thrown backward so that
the light from an electric lamp on the
corner shone full upon it. Tyler at once

Judre Ellsworth settled the long wran

The Question of the Jurisdiction of the
Alameda County court In the case was
the main point at Issue. Attorney W. H.
Chapman, representing "Baron" Baro
tea.u of Alameda, who has petitioned for
letters of guardianship In San Francisco,
contended that since her ladyship had
left the homo provided for her by W. B.
Greenbauxn, her former guardian in Oak
land, and had gone to San Francisco to
reside, she was under the jurisdiction of
the San Francisco courts. He therefore
argued that the citation cf the Oakland
court served upon Lady Yarde-Builer in
accordance with Greenbauni's petition
that &. guardiitn be appointed, was illegal,
mzid that asy procedure of the Alameda
County court in the case would be in
valid.

A NEW GUARDIAN
Charles M. Reade and Mrs. William Allen Are the Runaways,
and the Husband Finds Them in Oakland.
Â©- AKLAND, Jan. H.â The treach
ery of a friend, the faithlessness
'of a young wife and the stern
pursuit of an embittered husband
w were- revealed '., to-day with "the
arrest of Charles M- Reade, a wholesale
liquor merchant' of Granfell, Northwest
Territory, who ! eloped three Â¦ weeks ago
with Mrs. William Allen, wife of an in
surance man of that town, who located
the guilty couple here this morning
through" the efforts of Detectives Kyte
and Hamerton.:.
It was the old story of a confiding hus
band and the blind infatuation of an er
ring-wife, who, boldly declared her love
for the man who invaded the little home
and stole away his friend"s spouse.
"I am your wife in the sight of man,
but I am Charlie's in the sight of God."
was the runaway wife" s declaration when
her husband and the detectives confronted
her at the' rooms, corner of Tenth and
Jefferson streets, and took Reade into
custody upon an accusation of adultery
sworn to by Allen.*
"Good-by, dearest," was ReadÂ»'s" salute
as he was marched away between the po
licemen.
"I could have killed that man on the
spot," exclaimed the betrayed husband,
"but the presence of the detectives saved
him. I have traveled thousands of miles
and have spent- hundreds of dollars to
nnd this couple, for I believe this wretch
should suffer punishment. For my wife,
well, unless she will go home to her aged
parents she will have their lives on her
soul, for this has nearly killed them."
Young Allen and Mrs. Alien, then Lucy 1
McGara, the daughter, of Mr. and Mrs. P.
McGara of Reglna, Assinibola, N. W. T.*,
were married two and a half years ago.
Allen took his wife to Granlell, a few
miles west on the Canadian < Pacific Rail
road, and there built and furnished a
pretty home. A 'year ago he became ac
quainted with Reade, who was conduct
ing a prosperous business. ! Reade was
shortly introduced into the home. Allen's
business took him away from the town
and Reade became a frequent caller dur
ing the young man's absence.
A month ago Mrs. Allen started for a
holiday visit with her parents at Reglna.
At least that was'the Btory she told her
husband. Simultaneously Reade sold his
business and went to .Winnipeg, Manitoba.
A few days later ' Allen s eyes were
opened. His discoveries led him at once
to go to tne-Regina home.- From there
he went Immediately to Winnipeg. The
police authorities were notified, and it was
a matter of only a few days before the
missing wife- and Reade were traced.
They had purchased tickets for this city
and the police here were notified. Allen
came post haste. JTwo days ago the pair
were discovered, but their place of resi
dence was not uncovered until this morn
ing. They had been occupying rooms aÂ»
"Mrt and Mrs. Reade."
Allen is 28 years of age and h!s wife is
four years younger. She is not at all pre
possessing, and according to her husbana
had only recently recovered from a severe
illness. Reade is 32 years old.
"There is not a single extenuating cir
cumstance," said Allen when heconsented
to talk about the affair. "My wife's broth
er, P. McGara Jr., who is a prominent
man of Regina, is using every effort to
induce Lucy to go back home. I do not
care what becomes of myself. All I ask of
her Is that Bhe return to her broken
hearted mother and father. I tried to
turn her mind to them, but It seems as if

Former Bookkeeper at San Quentin
Penitentiary Tells How the Ab
sconding Clerk- Carried On
His Thieving Work.
While the experts who are at work or.
the books and records of the San Quen
tin prison have only gone back as far as
1897 and have nothing to report other than
the Levy transaction. The Call is In a
position to Inform the public that as
early as 18S5 Walden, the. absconding
clerk, although then wearing the garb of
a convict, was, with the assistance of a
clique outside the prison walls, engaged
in a profitable scheme of robbery.- That
he was able to carry on his crooked work
without detection is proof positive that
there was a laxity of supervision in the
management of the affairs of that I State
penal Institution. Not only- were bales of
bags stolen and sold to confederates in
this city, but the waste Jute material waa
used as a source of profit to those who
were on the inside of the robbery scheme.
In 1885, the late Paul Shirley was Warden.
Joseph Ellis, who recently died, was clerk
of the Board of Prison Directors and also
confidential clerk of the Warden. . Cap
tain Charles Aull had charge of the
prison yard, but over them all, If rumor
is true, Walden was master. He secured
their confidence and as clerk in . the
Warden's office took charge of the gen
eral management of the business relating
to the Jute mill. '."Â¦Â¦.
While in the penitentiary he by modest
demeanor and attention to the clerical
duties required of him. won the confidence
of the otticers and his word was law. If
an order came for a shipment of bags the
Warden turned it over to him to attend
to. If any material was needed for the
mills he was intrusted with the business.
In this way he became thoroughly fam
iliar with the management 'of aifairs. So
great was the trust placed in him that not
a paper or document passed through tho
prison office without going through his
hands. It was through the influence oi
the officials whose confidence he was be
traying that in 1887 he waa pardoned, He
was then placed on tho payroll of the
prison at a monthly salary of $100, and at
the time of his flight was enjoying a sal
ary of JHO'a month. He waa so suave in
manner that during: succeuslve adminis
trations he was able to retain his place.
At one time an attempt was made to
have him removed, but it failed because
of the backing of the directors and prison
officials, who believed that he was hon
est and straightforward. When the ob
jection was made that the crime- which
brought him behind the penitentiary walls
showed that he. waa. a man utterly un
worthy of confidence or trust, the officials
who had been blinded by his oily ways
answered that notwithstanding the fact
he had greatly erred they believed him
sincere in his protestations of penitence
for his crinÂ»e. . i2n joying. the conndence of
the officials above him, it was' an easy
matter for him to rob the penitentiary
and the State.
A former bookkeeper who was employed
In the jute mill- in San Quentin in li86 ex
pressed himself yesterday as being greatly
surprised that Walden should have been
able to carry on his peculations for over
fifteen years and then escape before his
crooked work was discovered.
"But, come to think of It," said he, "no
one who is acquainted with the way in
which the business of the Jute mill was
conducted when I was there need be sur
prised. I was in the jute mill for seven
years. My duties consisted of seeing that
the convicts who are assigned for work
there reported every morning. If any of
them failed to show up'I notified the
Warden's office and-the reasons for their
absence were given. One of them might
be sick, another might have been excused
to meet some visitor or friend, or another
might have been assigned by the "Warden
for some other duty. In addition to keep
ing a roll call I .had nothing else to do
but make reports to Walden. If an order
came from the Interior to the Warden for
a certain number of bags "Walden always
was directed to see that the order was
tilled. It was generally supposed that all
orders were filled from the warehouse,
but such- was not the case. The public
may be surprised that it was possible for
Walden to ship 50,000 sacks to Levy and to
receive the money for the same and not
be detected. It is not surprising to me,
however, for I had not been, in the Jute
mill more than a few months when I dis
covered that the State was being robbed."
"Will you explain how It- was possible
to steal and ship these bales without tne
robbery being detected?" - x
â¢ "I will," said the ex-bookkeeper. ."It
waa a rule, but a rule that was not ob
served, that at the close of each day's
work the bags manufactured should be
bent to the warehouse. Sometimes they
would not be removed from the mill for
two or three days. There was always
some excuse for the delay. The convicts
whose duty It was to > remove them were
oft on some other work, or the -warehouse
clerk was away from his post. If the bags
piled up and complaint was made to Wal
den he would shrug his shoulders and say:
'We will get them out after a while.' It
was In : one way through this failure to
daily remove the bags that Walden was
able to carry on his crooked work. That
was the foundation stone of the robbery.
To understand the second step it will be
necessary for "me to tell you how the
warehouse was managed. As I said be
fore, It was believed that the bags were
dally removed from the Jutemlll, but they
were not. Then they had a peculiar sys
tem of checking In the warehouse; to say
the least of It. At the end of the year
there were always quite a number of
bales of bags left over and unsold. I These
left-over bags were the capital of Walden
and his accomplices. "With the beginning
of the year the warehouse clerk would
commence anew to number the bales as
he received them fromthe jutemlll. Had
the clerk of the warehouse been attentive
he must have necessarily: found out that
he was. not receiving the proper amount
of manufactured goods when there would
as sometimes, be a lapse of two or three
days between receipts from the Jutemlll
Walden generally managed to keep in the
Jutemlll a sufficient number of bales to
correspond with the hold-over stock from
the previous year. Â¦ -
- "To better exemplify his crooked busi
ness way. I will give a supposititious case.
We will say that at the -end of the year
there were fifty bales left over. A week
later 250 bales had been manufactured and
numbered. That would leave 300 bales in
the warehouse. The clerk of the ware
house dally made report as to the num
ber of bales he had received and marked
durinsr that period. _ You now see that if
any Question was ever -made about the
stock, on hand, the new marking would
be 250 bales and fifty left over. The goods
manufactured this lapse between
shipments to the warehouse were In the
Jute mill. "Walden had there his capital
stock, for the. books in the Warden's of
fice would only show the number of. bales
the ' warehouse clerk had : received and
marked. ' When an . order came In from
one of his -confederates Walden, Instead
of going to the warehouse and having the
order filled from there; would come u> mo
and say: !We are lna hurry to getSt)!*
stuff off and- we cannot wait for the cleric
at the "warehouse.-* Throw... ten or twenty
bales on. the trucks and send them down
to the landing.'.;
"Of these goods no record can ever be
found- in the. prison books, . for .. the vary
simple reason -that .the records' are made
up from the reports of the warehouse
clerk, t He could not report goods on hand
that he did not receive. If any one ques
tioned the correctness 1 of the numben of
bales in the warehouse they would simply
find that- according to ; the books there
should be 300 bales. . They we're In the
warehouse. The fifty left over from the
year before and the 250 manufactured ac
cording to this supposititious case."

they stand at present the bonds are not worth the

that the bond must be executed to the city and\ county

CARSON, New, Jan. 2L-The twentieth
session of the Nevada Legislature opened
at noon to-day. "Van Duzer, "who ia a
pronounced anti-lottery man, waq, select
ed of the House'. Though the
lottery people stated before the caucus
meeting that they would take no hand in
the fight the anti-lottery men felt Jubi
lant over the success of Van Duzer. Both
sides regard the fight as 'a close one.
William Sharon, Congressman New
lands' political associate, in an interview
stated that he had assumed tho same po-,
sitlon as has Mr. Newlands In his publish
ed Interviews, and that he would use hfs
best efforts to defeat the lottery amend
ment both In the Legislature and before
the people. It is not thought that any
action on the measure will take place be
fore next week. >
House by the Nevada *
Van Duzer Is Selected Speaker of the
ANTI-LOTTERY MEN"
DRAW FIRST BI.OOD
Governor Brady refuses to discuss the
matter further than to say that he has
not recommended the transfer of Judge
Noyes.
TV hereas, well-known and respected cit
izens returning 1 from Nome unanimously
condemn the conduct of the court at
xsome, and Judge Noyea* reputation in
Southeastern Alaska is of the worst, and
his services would be of no value to this
people, and productive of great harm,
therefore we protest against the trans
fer."
The Chamber adopted resolutions ad
dressed to the United States Attorney
General, in the course of which the fol
lowing appears:
Press dispatches from Washington,
which have asserted that Governor Brady
recommended the transfer, have made the
people of Southeastern Alaska very un
easy. The Bar Association ot Juneau has
taken up the cudgel to prevent the coiv
templated change, and at a recent meet-
Ing of the Juneau Chamber of Commerce
a speech was made by President McEbers,
in which Judge Noyes was arraigned In
severe terms. The president said that he
was not talking from what he had read in
newspapers, but from personal interviews
with Nome miners.
SEATTLE, Jan. 21.-Ther Chamber oi
Commerce of Juneau has adopted resolu
tion? condemning', in unmeasured terma
the alleged methods of Jud^e Noyea ol
Nome- and protesting against the transf ei
of Judge Noyea to Southeastern Alaska,
The - contemplated change would deprtv*
Juneau of Judge Brown. If changes mu3t
be made Juneau people prefer that Judge
Wickersham be transferred to Nome,
leaving Judge Brown where he is. J

â¢ DRAWING TO A CLOSE
Warburton's side of the story Is that
out of friendship for Reilly's dead father
he tried to reform John and make a man
of him; that he; has done hundreds of fa
vors-for the Reilly family; that Matt
Reilly, owed* him borrowed
money; that he beat John Reilly because
he had < lied about â¢Â¦. him . and â¢ started Â¦ the
scandalous story;* that Matt supported
his brother, and that both on many occa
sions threatened to kill '.him.. .With calm
ness and confidence the accused awaits
his. trial. .-'Â¦Â¦â¢.-. â¢â¢Â¦; .:>.Â¦-
bruising his side.. Reilly. struggled to his
feet after his assailant had departed and
In â¢ the . blindness of his | rage he told the
bystanders a story, that shocked as quick
.ly.as It spread through the community.
He sought the> services of a night watch
man tc see him to the family home, 'as he
said â¢ Warburton would . try. to kill him.
Here is where * Matthew/ Reilly took the
part that resulted ! In his . death. It â¢ Is
stated that after the assault' Matt went
to Warburton and told him to-leave John
alone, and not speak to 'him; -that- he 'was
going to put him ; to work in '. his shop
when he cams back, -he having left town
for a few days to let things be forgotten.
Last Saturday afternoon "Warburton
met John - Reilly on . Fourth ' street and
started to address him. Reilly ran Into
a laundry,- and : when he emerged later
Warburton Â¦ again â¢ addressed Â« him. John
said, "I don't want to "talk to you. I've
been told to say nothing to you."
.'-When seen, at 'the jail Warburton says
that at that meeting, John threatened to
kill him. The .'prosecution have â¢ several
witnesses who will swear that Warburton
exhibited -his pistol after the meeting and
said. "Reilly will: get -this." It will be
the' theory of the . prosecution that Matt
Ilellly. when. he. was -shot, .was about to
ask Warburton to leave his brother alone.
William J. Kirkwood, a telegraph oper
ator, was found dead yesterday afternoon
in his room at 607 Eddy street. Kirkwood
was recently I released from the Insane
asylum j at - Stockton and on his: arrival
in this city went to, a former residence
and applied for a room. - Because of his
previous attempt to : commit suicide arid
other strange acts he was refused. On
Wednesday last he hired the room in
which he died. ' ; -' : \
Sunday evening he- asked" the proprie
tor of the house not to wake him until -3
o clock the following ; day, as he had
considerable writing to do and would not
retire until late: . When the landlord
knocked at Klrkwood's door and received
no response /he entered through a Bide
window and found the , man dead. Cir
cumstances indicate -that Kirkwood com
mitted suicide. On a table .was an enve
lope containing $8 addressed to i Mrs.' E.
J. Moore of 1422 Larkin street.. Consider
able poison was also found in his' trunk.
The body was taken to the Morgue, where
Dr. Bacipalupi , gave i as < his opinion that

something to make the audience forget
its troubles. Tom Hickey will thrill in

best for charity.
The number of which most is expected,
however, is "A Pair of Lunatics," a farce
with screaming situations and full of

until about seven weeks ago. Here the
stories conflict. Some eay that Matthew
got a promise from his brother John that
he would leave the villa.
One evening, about that time, .Warbur

Back of Saturday night's killing is an
old stftry and a strange , one. ' old,* be
cause for months, whether; true or un
true, it has. floated about. this city on the
waves of gossip, and strange because it
tells of great depravity.
The killing of Matt_ Reilly . Saturday
night forms one of the concluding chap
ters and the end of the trial of his slayer
will form the last.
SAN' RAFAEL, Jan. 21.â The funeral of
Matthew Reilly, who was shot Saturday
night by W. F. Warburton. will take place
to-morrow afternoon from his home in
this city. Extensive preparations have
been made and it will probably be one of
the largest funerals ever seen here. The
military company under Captain Cheda
will attend In force. The deceased was
for many years a member of the com
pany.
The inquest was held by Coroner Eden
this morning and the jury, after listening
to the evidence of several eye-witnesses,
returned a -verdict finding that deceased
came to his' death from a gunshot wound
inflicted by Warburton. The latter was
afterward served with a warrant in -the
County. Jail charging him i with \ murder.

and asked to speak to him for a minute.
Warburton refused and told him- to -go
away. Reilly was insistent and repeated
his request, at the same " time stepping

In the City Prison is a ' woman who, the
police claim, is an adept burglar. Her
name, so she says, is Mrs. Ross. She was
arrested last night by Detectives Ryan

found a trunk filled with stolen property,
awaiting shipment to come other city.
For several weeks the woman has oper

amounting to several hundred dollars.
Her scheme was to select a house which
she thought was easy to enter, take up a
position on the I other side of the street
and await a. favorable opportunity to en
ter, with the aid of a skeleton key. A
few days ago- she was surprised while
ransacking a house in the 'Western Addi

she was selling:, she announced that she
was a book agent, and after profusely
apologizing she left the house. She had
been gone only a few minutes, when the

A monster dredger has been shipped
from the RLsdon Iron Works to the Ber
rim Gold Dredging Company at Aehantl,
South Africa- This shipment is of great
significance. The dredger weighs more
than 100 tons. The cost of shipping will
be $3VK>. although the machine's total
value is said to be only $20,000.
Six months ag-o the company sent an
engineer here to buy a dredger. The Ris
don Iron Works was given the order and
the dredger has been shipped.
A unique feature of this dredger is the
fact that it can be taken to pieces and
pzek^d on muieback to its destination. It
mupt also traverse two miles of sea on
t-urf boats before it can be set ashore.

.0 dramatization that attempts to
w f cover the time covered by a
R m long novel can be anything
Â¥\ I but a succession of scenes, the
I \l connection between which must
I Vj be supplied by the knowledge
I \ or the imagination of the audl-
M ence. Jf a representation of
p this kind gives pleasure, It Is
a success and there is no more
to be said, except that this is
not a play in th* true sense of the word.
A true play tells its story with unity,
with logic, with propriety of character
motivation. Pinefo's "The Gay Lord"
Is a true play; Dumas" "Diane de "Lys"
is a true play; Mr. Langdon Mitchell's
"Becky Sharp" Is not a true playâ but
It contains some Interesting scenes.
Among these interesting scenes one can
hardly count the first act, which Is saved
from utter flatness only by the excellent
acting of Miss Mary Barker as Miss
Crawley, and of Mr. Ferguson as Sir Pitt.
The second act, at the Duchess of Rich
mond's bail. Brussells, is a brilliant if
somewhat confused panorama of the
events of Waterloo eve, across which flits
the erratic figure o# Becky Sharp. The
play proper hardly begins until the third
act, which shows Rawdon Crawley hard
pressed for debt, Becky trying to cajole
money out of every man she meets and
Lord Steyne making love to her. This
act is awkwardly cut into two scenes,
the second of which represents the fam
ous supper of Becky and Lord Steyne
with Rawdon's unexpected return and the
rout of the Marquis. The fourth act
gives us Becky down on her luck in a
shabby German lodging house, her rescue
by Sir Pitt and Lady Jane, with Intima
tion of her liaison with Joseph Sedley.
It Is in this last act, which is pure com
edy, that Mrs. Fiske appears at her best.
Her high, sharp, metallic voice and her
brisk personality fit her far better for
light than for serious work. In comedy,
too, her native sense of humor gets full
opportunity, and her highly artificial art
appears least artificial. She still labors
under the delusion that you can get real
istic effects by turning your back on half
the audience and speaking Into the wings,
and that a speed of two hundred and fifty
words a minute is necessary - to anima
tion. Strange that so clever and accom
plished an artiste should refuse to ac
cept two of the most elementary conven
tions that are absolutely necessary for
the art of the theater!
The play Is beautifully staged and the
support adequate. Mr. Gillmore as Raw
don Crawley started weak and finished
strong. Admirably done, also, were the
sketches â they could be little more â of
Amelia by Miss McGllvray, of Dobbin by
Mr. Conneirs and of George Osborne by
Mr. Gerson.
"Vanity Fair" can never be on the
stage what It is in the book â never, that
is, until we get a dramatist of genius
equal to Thackeray's as a novelist. But
Mrs. Fiske's version Is a courageous and
Intelligent attempt to accomplish the im
possible and as such is well worth seeing.

considerable smoothness. One missed,
however, to a certain extent, the firm grip

yet the game sympathy between leader
and led as was manifest between HJrsch
feld and the orchestra, but there Is no
necessity for the lagging tempos that
were In evidence last evening, and no
excuse for the "drowning out" of tha
soloists. The balance of things will, no
doubt, arrange Itself whhin a day or
two, and meantime there Is much to
praise.
The only Ferris divides honors with
Edward Webb in the comedy interest of
"The Fencing Master," and honors were
easy, between them but that Webb as
Galeazzo Vlscortl. Duke of Milan, has the
better part. It Is a Frank Daniels sort
of creation, and, If my chronology be
right, "The Ameer" has a scene lifted
bodily from this De Koven & Smith
opera, the brigand scene with the Ameer
being Identical with the Duke of Milan's
little affair with the Italian bravos.

THE SAN AbKAJNUlSuO CALL, TUESDAY; JA2SUAKY aii, ly^i.
The show at the Orpheum this week Is
unquestionably one of the best ever pro
duced at this popular house. With three
exceptions ; all . the features are new and
most of them, have the merit of being
above the, usual standard of excellence.
Last night the house was crowded, not
withstanding,'the rain, and the large aud
ience was delighted with' the programme.
Sam Lockhart's' baby elephants continue
to be the stellar attraction and deserved
ly bo. The Montmartrois trio of operatic
vocalists met with a storm of applause
after their first number, which was in
tensified after their second appearance
in the soldiers' i chorus from "Faust."
They were recalled four times, and even
then the audience was not satisfied.
Swigette and Clarke, in their sketch in
troducing their imitations of "Sis" Hop
kins, are clever and they established
themselves as favorites. The Schu
mann's Quartet made its initial bow on
the coast and met with a flattering re
ception. Miss Adams, who plays the 'cel
lo, iÂ« a finished artist. Hacker and Les
ter, comedy acrobatic cyclists, and "War
ren and Blanchard. in a sketch, "My
Valet," complete the new attractions.
Eugene CRourke and Miss Rose Bra
ham, in the sketch "Parlor A." have es-
Orpheum.
ThÂ« . sweet, poetic themÂ© of Plnero's
"Sweet Lavender" was artistically . pre
sented at the Alcazar Theater last even
ing, and while thÂ« play was not quite por
trayed with that subtle delicacy which the
author intended, the members of the "com
pany scored a success. "Sweet Lavender"
Is as delicate as the perfume of Its name
sake and requires the most careful treat
ment. No fault, can be found with the
handling of tho play as seen in the per
formance by the - Alcazar company , last
night. Every member of the cast seemed
to grasp intelligently the author's idea
of the character enacted, and; secured
from the audience the greatest of tributes
â alternate tears and laughter. Who could
not help loving dear Dick Phenyl, the
broken-down barrister, whose clothes are
shiny but whose heart is as true as steel?
And what a charming picture of woman
hood is : Lavender! Pinero truly held the
mirror up to nature when he evolved the
play, and it is due the Alcazar company
to say that no better performance of
"Sweet Lavender" has ever been seen in
this city. Clarence Montaine, Howard
Scott and Lucius Henderson realized the
ideas of the roles they presented, and
Juliet -Crosby and Llla Convere returned
to the Alcazar stage to add more laurels
to their collection. Miss Crosby has im
proved rapidly In the few short. years of
her career, and her bantering love scenes
last night were artistic to a degree. MIbs
Convere aa. the heroine. was the ideal or
the role, never overacting but . always
natural and self-possessed. The smaller
roles were well played and the staging of
the play reflects credit on the manage
ment. "Sweet Lavender" Is well worth a
second visit and should easily remain In
the bill for some time.
