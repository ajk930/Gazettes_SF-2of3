Five or six years ago one of the Raders
loaned a friend $170 and took as security
a mortgage on sixteen acres of barren
land In the present Kern River oil dis
trict. He tried to sell it several times,
but no one would buy the property, and
out of prim determination he paid tho
taxes and held on, trusting In the irriga

now the sixteen acres ero worth a for

HALIFAX. N. S., Feb. 24.-Xews of the
death of Major A. C. Howard, better
known as "Gatling Gun" Howard, caused
a sensation here, where he has been well
known. His connection with the Cana
dian forces dates back to the Rial rebel
lion. In 1SP5, when he was in cUarge of a
gatling gun sent out with tho forces to
the Northwest. Howard lived at Browns
ville, sixty miles from Ottawa, and left
home last year with the second contin

in the South African campaign. Later he
organized a corps of 100 Canadian scouts
and was leading them when he met his
death.

"General Dewet, after unsuccessfully
attempting to cross the Brak at Klip

At dawn Colonel Plumer left Welgever
don. twenty-two miles west of the Boer
camp, and moved northeasterly. At
Zurugat he attacked the enemy, taking
forty prisoners. Tho pursuit was contin
ued during the afternoon, the Boers mov
ing toward Hopetown. Toward evening
the leading troop sighted the enemy, who
had laagered beyond range. Colonel Owen,
charged the spot where the Boer artillery
was supposed to be and captured the
whole of It. ThÂ» enemy fled, leaving their
horses ready saddled and their cooking
pots full. According to the latest reports
only 400 Boers recrossed to the north side
of the river. The Orangre Is greatly swol

LONDON. Feb. 24.â The Vienna corre-
There have been many conferences to
day, but the whole question as to whether
there should be an extra session or not
hangs to-night on the intention of the
Democrats to permit such amendment to
the army bill as may be presented being
brought to a vote. If they filibuster they
can throw the whole matter over beyond
March 4, and an extra session will bo
inevitable.
Some very pretty tactics may develop
this week If the Democratic members
should prove stiff-necked. The army ap
propriation bill, to which it Is proposed to
attach the declaration on Cuban rela
tions, now has precedence in the Senate
over other appropriation bills. The river
and harbor bill is still far in the back
ground. Fully 90 per cent of the Dem
ocratic Senators are deeply Interested in
this bill. It contains many Items of the
greatest possible Interest In their com
mittees, and it may be used as a club
during the closing hours of the session to
bring about an agreement to reach a vote
on tho Cuban proposition.
Senator Jones said emphatically that he
would not favor any dictation by the
United States to Cuba. He declined to
commit himself on any specific proposi
tion until it should be advanced In the
Senate. â¢
"I should like to vote." said he, "once
more in favor of Senator Teller's resolu
tion of April 1, 1898. in which we declared
Cuba to be free and Independent and dis
claimed any intention of interfering with
her sovereignty."
Senator Jones' reply was not of a na
ture encouraging to those who were seek
ing to avoid an extra session.
"Are you In. favor of Congress voting
at this session on a resolution or amend
ment to the army bill denning the status
of Cuba so far as It relates to the United
States?"
The Democratic party still remains an
unknown quantity. A large majority of
Republican Senators are pledged to the
programme of meeting the President's
views on the Cuban question in an amend
ment to the army appropriation bill. The
most ultra opponents of any policy that
permitted the United States. to have any
hand in Cuban affairsâ Senators Teller
and Money-^have In a measure been won
over to the plan of avoiding an extra ses
sion. Before this plan can be carried out
Senator Jones of Arkansas and his asso
ciates must be brought into the fold. It
was explained to-day that Senator Jones
might be willing to consent to this ar
rangement and permit the amendment to
come to a vote without filibustering, or
he might occupy the position before the
country of assuming responsibility for
compelling the President to call a long
and expensive extra pesslon of Congress.
Senator Jones was asked this question
to-day:
If Congress meets this question, the
President is willing to take the respon
sibility of conducting- negotiations with
Cuba without calling an extra session.. He
has told the Senators" this and that'ex
plains the remarkable, activity among
Democratic and Republican Senators alike
In seeking to reach an agreement so that
they may return, home and attend to
their private affairs.
CALLi HEADQUARTERS, 1408 G
STREET N. W.. WASHINGTON, Feb.
24.â In the Cuban situation two important
news developments to-day were:
That the President is willing to forego
calling an extra session in case Congress
is able to agree upon a declaration of our
future relations with Cuba to meet his
views.
That the condition In the Democratic
party Is such that the question whether
there shall be such declaration by Con
gress rests now upon the few \ leading
Democrats of the Senate, notable among
whom is Senator James K. Jones of Ar
kansas, chairman of the Democratic Na
tional Committee.
There has been considerable doubt as
to whether President McKinley would,
under any circumstances, be willing to
assume the responsibility of passing on
the Cuban constitution and relations with
Cuba unless the constitution had first
been sent to Congress. The President has
at last consented, in response to over
tures from almost the entire Republican
representation in the Senate, to take
charge of the constitution when it is sent
here, . provided Congress shall declare
whether in Its opinion the United States
should have a right to intervene in Cuba;
to have a voice in the islands" foreign
affairs; to pass upon the question of the
creation of an enormous bonded debt; to
supervise sanitary. and commercial Inter
course and to have coaling stations.

by an occasional rush to the water's
edge, where frantic grabs we:?e made for
any object that floated within reach with
the hope of securing a memento of the
disaster. The possessor of the smallest
piece of wood that bore the least possible
resemblance to any portion of a vessel's
structure, on exhibiting his prize, was Im
mediately surrounded by a crowd.
An occasional tear and sometimes an
audible Bob told why some of the on
lookers stood there, sazlng upon the wa
ters that had robbed them of loved ones.
Curiosity, doubtless prompted the rest. At
the lookout station John Hyslop,' marina
reporter' for the Merchants' - Exchange,
scanned " the beach with his 'Â¦ powerful
glass in search of possible victims and
wreckage. Earlier in the day Captain
Varney and his crew of the South-Side
Life-saving Station patroled the vicinity
at Bakers Beach, journeying to the limits
of the life-saving station at Fort Point
and acting In conjunction with the latter
crew.
In the afternoon there was a heavy surf
running In from the sea and the breakers
were rolling furiously over the Potato
Patch on the Marln shore. This should
serve to cast the wreckage and the bodies
of possible victims within the limits of
the bay. Outside the breakers roared dis
mally enough, and a great many of tho
thousands who crowded the heights wan
dered down the beach below the CllfC
House to search for relics along the
sands. Not le3S than 20,000 to 30.000 people
visited the beach and heights during the
afternoon.
The bay was dotted with craft of every
description, hut the choppy^state of
the sea rendered the condition of those
occupying them anything but a pleasant
one. but the desire to know of anything
new concerning the wreck was greater
than their fear of a ducking or the chilly
wlnd, and they remained until late in the
afternoon.
The sands of Baker's beach afforded a
resting place and greater opportunity for
sight-seeing, and to this spot the largest
crowd thronged. . Here also were, the
souvenir hunters gathered in large num
bers, though their chances of securing a
piece of the vessel to adorn their parlor
mantels were considerably lessened by
the breakers which the strong southeast
wind drove high up on the beach. : ; ;
The police patrol Is still on duty along
the ocean front, but their vigilance has
not met with any reward. The only thins
of real Importance to appear during the
entire day was a skylight and a portion
of the ship's cabin, which came to tha

Purser Thomas Smith of the Alameda,
Â¦who arrived in port yesterday, says that
eight or nine passengers on that steamer
came within an ace of taking passage on
the City of Rio de Janeiro at Honolulu.
The Alameda left the day after the Rio,
and the passengers delayed taking pass
age for this city, because of the fine
weather -which prevailed in the islands. It
had been raining for a month or more,
and the weather cleared up a day or two
before the Rio sailed. The fine weather
continued, and so the passengers, put off
their homecoming until the next day.
When the Alameda reached port the pilot
who was taken on board reported the
news of .the disaster. The passenger's felt
so grateful at what they regarded as a
lucky deliverance that a testimonial was
drawn up .to Captain Herrlman. signed by
every one of the seventy passengers on
board. _.' :

Although* a careful patrol was kept
along the beach and bay yesterday not a
single body was recovered. A small
amount of woodwork from the deck struc
tures of the Rio do Janeiro was found
floating by some fishermen near the
Heads.
The terrible disaster which cost so many
lives was made the subject of a cruel
hoax. A beer bottle was picked up in the
afternoon at Bakers Beach, and inside
was a piece of parafflne paper on which
was written In faint pencil lines the fol
lowing:
It Is expected that to-day tho Pacific
Mall Company will have an attempt made
by divers to reach the wreck, In order to
recover the bodies which must be lmprli
oned In it.
Those whom an error of Judgment- had
robbed of kith and kin had the satisfac

where their beloved dead lay sepulchered
in the tangled mass of a steamship's
wreckage.
It was almost sunset when Captain-Hat
eon and his life-saving crew had their at
tention drawn to masses of lumber com
ing to the surface of the water. The life
saving boat hovered in tho vicinity, and
other pieces of wreckage from time to
time floated upward. There was but little
current at the time, and Captain Hatson

their way to the ccean beach to gaze
upon the placid waters beneath which the
bodies of many victims of Friday's disas
ter still lay, the cr?ws of the life-saving
stations were at work, hoping to mark
the spot where the. Rio de Janeiro took
her last plunge and hurled 121 precious
lives Into eternity.
Fatality decided that the men whose
mission Is to save life should yesâ¢rday be
locators of the dead. Up and down the
waters in the vicinity of Fort Point the
life-saving crews rowed, and during the
day they were watched by many thou

SALEM, Or., Feb. 24.â John' H.
f 4 Mitchell was elected United States
\ Senator at 12:30 this morning to
' succeed Senator George W. Mc-
Bride, whose term expires on
March 4 next. His election was accom
plished by a combination of thirty-five
Republicans with eleven Democrats, mak
ing forty-six votes, a majority of the
Legislature.
The result was reached on the twenty
fifth ballot of the <lay and the fifty-third
of the session. At noon Saturday the
joint assembly met and took one ballot
for Senator and then adjourned until 8 p.
m., when balloting was resumed. Both
houses had decided to adjourn sine die at
midnight Saturday, and the prospect of
an exciting close brought thousands of
people to the Capitol.
The voting proceeded without material
change for twenty ballots. Just as the
assembly was about to take the twenty
lirst l;al!ot State Senator Brov,nell arose
ami presented the name of John H. Mitch
el!, which was received with tremendous
applause. The twenty-first ballot gave
H. \V. Corbett oG. J. H. Mitchell 35 and A.
S. Bennett <D.) 19. Three more ballots
were taken, with but few changes.
The hands of the clock had already
pointed to midnight and the clerks were
engaged In checking up the roll call for
the twenty-fifth ballot. There was great
excitement and loud calls of the name of
Mitchell from the lobby. The first de
serter from the Corbett "ranks was H<?m
enway of Lane. On the previous roll call
Mitchell had had 34 votes and Corbett 3G.
When his name was reached Hemenway,
in the last roll call, without explanation*,
responded John H. Mitchell. The call pro
ceeded to the end and Mitchell nnd Cor
bett were then exactly tied, having 35
votes each. Then McQueene of Lane
arose and with a brief speech changed to
Mitchell, nutting him in the lead. Nine
others changed to Mitchell, giving him 45
votes, within one of the goal. There was
a brief wait, and then the nams of "Mat
toon" of Douglass, repeated with great
House has failed to act, however, and the
prospects are that the measure will fall.
A number of other measures of more or
less importance have received a certain
degree of consideration, but will not pass
at this Fession. They include the Joint
resolution proposing a constitutional
amendment for the election of United
States Senators by the direct vote of the
people, which was passed in the House
but has remained unacted upon in the
Senate, and bills to establish .the Depart
ment of Commerce and Industry, to en
dow State schools of mining with a por
tion of the proceeds of public land sales,
authorizing the President to appoint a
commission to study the commercial and
Industrial conditions of China' and Japan
and to regulate trusts and other organi
zations In restraint of trade. â¢ ;
Besides the anti-trust bill, passed by
the House and not acted upon by the
Senate, a resolution proposing a constitu
tional amendment giving Congress more
ample power to deal with trusts was de
feated In the House. Another measure
defeated was that defining the power of
injunction and limiting the authority of
the Federal courts to issue this process. .
Trouble With the Trebles.
Much of the time of the Senate has
been occupied 5n important treaties con
sidered behind closed doors. This Includ
ed the Hay-Pauncefote treaty neutraliz
ing the Nicaragua canal; treaties with
Great Britain and Germany dissolving the
tripartite agreement on Samoa and divid
ing the islands; commercial reciprocity
treaties with France. Germany, the Ar
gentine republic. Nicaragua and witn
Great Britain respecting the various Brit
ish colonies of the West Indies.
The contest over the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty was vigorously conducted through
both sessions. After a sharp contest at
this session the treaty was amended so as
to permit the United States to adopt
such measures of military protection of
the canal as the interests of this Govern
ment may require. In this amended form
thfe treaty was returned to Great Britain.
The final action of that Government will
liaveto be made known before the pres
ent Congress expires if the treaty Is to be
effective.
The various reciprocity treaties have
not received the attention at the hands of
the Senate that was desired fcy those who
negotiated them and by the numerous for
eign Governments Interested. They com
prise all the treaties made under the reci
procity section of the Dingley tariff act.
and the inaction of the Senate on these
treaties appears to terminate the pro
tracted negotiations which have been car
ried on. by foreign Governments on the
subject of reciprocity by treaty.
Another treaty ratified by the Senate is
that purchasing of Spain for $100,000 sev
eral small islands north of the Philippine
group which were omitted from the ac
quisition of the treaty of Paris. The pay
ment to Spain' has been provided for In
the deficiency appropriation bill of the
present session.

that the committee is without power to

He then made the declaration that those
who framed the mischief by law were the
greatest enemies of mankind.

hall, and a-crowd of the Douglass County

to him excitedly. He 'seemed to be suc
cessfullv withstanding them, and soon
there arose cries of "deadlock," "ad

ed and changed his vote to Mitchell. This
was all that was needed, and the crowd
knew It. Pandemonium reigned for many
seconds and the chair made little effort
to check it. The clerks then completed
the roll and passed it up to President Ful
ton, who announced that Mr. Corbett had
"received 2fl votes, Mr. Mitchell 46 and Mr.
Bennett IS." The crowd went wild again,
fairly jumping up and down In their joy.
Mr. Mitchell had been in. the lobby all
evening watching the progress of the vot
ing. He was hurried forward through
the jostling crowd and escorted to the
platform, where he stood for a minute un
til order w.Â£s restored. Addressing the
vast audience he said:
"It would be Impossible for me at this
time to offer words in which to properly
express the gratitude that is swelling up
in my heart for the great distinction
Hhown me by your rendered votes. The
elevation to a seat in the United States
Senate Is a great distinction, the greatest
that can be conferred upon a citizen, but
when for a period of thirty years or less
than that tho same State, speaking
through four Legislatures, selects the
same man to that otllce he Is made the
recipient of a. debt that never can be paid
by mere words.
'There is only one way to recompense
you and tho State of Oregon, and that Is
faithful, earnest and efficient attendance
to the duties to which you have assigned
me. This I will endeavor to do.
"To all who cast a vote for me, Repub
licans, Democrats nnd Populists, my heart
goes out In deep gratitude. As to you
who voted for another, let me assure you
thnt I make no distinctions against you
I will represent all the people, all of Ore
gon, to the best of my ability."
Mr. Mitchell has served three full terms
in the United States Senate from Oregon

WASHINGTON. Feb. 24.â The record of
the Fifty-sixth Congress is now practi
cally completed and although a few Im
portant measures are Â»iil' In the balance.
It 1Â« ossible to take a sui vey of the wile
rar.ge of legislation com-.ldered and en
acted. It has been an eventful Congres3
!ri- many respects. Inheriting as It did
much of the work of reconstruction ar.d
*>xpÂ«nse made necessary by the events of
the war with Spain.
Chief. among these questions has been
the attitude of the Government toward
cur new insular possestio.ns. 'While 'this
Ciuestiori fs.stlll open to fome extent, yet
the present Congress has passed upen one
of its moet .important phases by enactinp
a law for a" complete form of government
for Porto Rico. The status of the Philip
pines has been an unfailing source of.de
late In both branches of Congress, but
with little tangible result. Cuban legisla
tion has been In abeyance pending- the
action of the constitutional convention of
Cuba in framing the constitution of tho
island. i'.y;
Hawaii's Governmental Change.
Another Important achievement In insu
lar legislation was that of enacting a Ian
giving Hawaii a complete form of ierrf
1'irial government with an insular Legis
lature and Judiciary, a Governor chosen
from Hawaii and a I>oleBrate in the HonM
cf Representatives. A Porto Rican Com
missioner also has bcrn accredited to
Washington.
Aside from these acts this Congress has
passed a financial law establishing a pe~
mar.ent pold reserve if about $150,000,000,
lixlnp the ratio between gold and silver
end reorganizing the"^bonding and the
liankinp system of the Treasury: re-irBnn
lzinie- the I'nited States army on a basis
of l"0.000 men; reapportioninK the repre
sentation In Coneress on the basis of t h <?
twelfth census; giving free homes on t'-.e
Indian lands; providing for Government
participation in the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition In 1903. as well as many Other
measures of wide peneral Importance.
But the Conpxess Iraws to a close with
some of the most important measures be
fore it still in doubt and quite likely to
expire without final action, it eluding Hie
Nicarapuan canal bill, the shipping fuIi
fldy bill, the Pacific cable and the oleo
marparine Mil. The fale of some of the^e
measures is very much in doubt, but at
this late dny in the session the chances
are oecidedly against them.
Appropriations Run High.
Th<> appropriations of tne present Coit

Â«RgTepatine for the two sessions approv

Laws Affecting Finance.
The financial lffcjslation Â°f the Con
prÂ«^:Â» had be^n of unusual importance
Â©nd lias "placed on the statute books the
law establishing the pold standard, pro
viding for the redemption and reissue of
the Interest-bearing bonded obligations of
the United State*, establishing a perma
nent gold reserve of $lo0,0 ( Â» .(Â«>>. regulating
rational hanks and making numerous pro
visions respecting circulation and the tax
en circulation.
The revenue legislation has been con
fined to an effort to reduce the taxation
imposed when the war with Spain-began.
A bill passed by the House reduced rev
enue about $4'i,000.00o. the chief reductions
being on boer and in the removal of the
i-tamp taxes on bank checks, telegrams,
commercial papers, life insurance poli
cies, proprietary medicine* and many
other articles. In tho Senate an entirely
new substitute was passed. This, how
ever, retained the main features of the
House bill, but materially changed the
rates throughout, adding reductions on
tobacco in various forms and restoring
the tax on bank checks. This revenue re
duction measure is still in controversy
between the two houses.
The twelfth census disclosed various in
creases in the States, and a bill providing
for a new basis of represcnraii in was en
acted. The total representation is fixed
at SS6 members, or twenty-nine more than
la the present Houee.
Military "Academy Stir.
Hazing at West Point has received at
tention at the present eepslon, with the
prospects that strong restrictive legisla
tion will be enacted. The Senate adopted
anti-hazing provisions In the military
academy appropriation bill. This has
Â£rouaÂ«?<l a counter movement, however,
taiA it will remain for the lawt days of the
tension' to determine Just what restric
tions on'h&zlnir are to be Imposed.
Aside from legislation the two houses
have peon several animated personal con
troversies. CnarppH of treason were made
against Delegate Wilcox of Hawaii, but
op ln<julry by the House committee the
Delegate was upheld in the right to his
teat on the ground that the charges re
ferred to action prior to the Hawaiian
territorial act. .
Kjieham H. Roberts of Utah was ex
pelled from the* House after an exciting
contest. Senator Quay of Pennsylvania
â¢was refused. a sent In the Senate on tho
appointment of Governor Btone. Sensa
tional charges against Senator Clark of
Montana were investigated by a Senate
committee, and the exciting mining riots
in the- Ovur d'Alene district of Idaho
were investigated. The Senate also ap
pointed a Cuban Inquiring committee, but
little has been accomplished In that line.
Measures .That May Die.
Four o^fthe most important measures
before the present Congress, namely, the
Nicarejruft canal bill, the shipping subsidy
biU, the Pacific cable bill and the oleo
margarine bill, have occupied much time
and have aroused great public attention.
The canal bill -was passed hi the Housa
of Representatives and authorized ex
penditures of SMO.Ono.OOO. with a present
appropriation of $10,000,000. The measure
Â¦was favorably reported to the Senate, but
owing to the complications arising over
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty the Senate
has not considered the bill, and it is like
ly to be one r of the measures to die with
the Congress.
. The ehlp eubFidy bill has been a sub
ject of active controversy, which in the
fieftate has been very bitter. The House
haÂ« taken no action on the bill, pending
the contest In the Senate, so that accord-
Ing to present Indications the bill will not
have a parliamentary status as having
paReed Â«>ither branch of Congress. ' â¢
The Pacific cable bill paused the Senate
at the first session and hae been pending
Jn the House since. It provides for a ca-
Ij1Â«. to Hawaii and tile Philippines under
Government management. ' The bill as
reported to the .Houee was favorable to
prjvate construction of the cable. The

FOR FINAL CONTESTS
Time Haa Now Practically Gone by
for the Passage of New Legis

WASHINGTON. Feb. 24.â The last week
of this Congress In the House will be
mainly occupied with conference reports
on the appropriation bills and the other
numerous measures now' being fought
over by the managers of the two houses.
The last of the general appropriation bills
Â¦went to the Senate on Thursday, and the
House had Its decks pretty well- cleared
for the final contests with the Senate.
Borne of these struggles will â¢ probably
be exceedingly fierce, buf when it comes
down to actual work the House can dis
pose of business under Its Â¦ rules with
much greater celerity than the Senate.
The last six days of- the session are sus
pension days, and It is always : possible
to bring the House to a vote on any prop
osition under a motion to suspend the
rules, which provide for only twenty min
utes' debate upon a side. The time has
practically gone by for the passage of
new bills, although an attempt doubtless
will be made to secure action on the bills
to promote the efficiency of the revenue
cutter service and to create a standardiz
ing bureau. Beyond these apd a few
small bills of local importance no effort
will be made to put through any bills. It
probably will be necessary to hold night
sessions during the latter part of the
week, and both houses, will set next Sun
day to continue the legislative day of Sat

man's attempt to wreck the Revere
House saloon oh Saturday morning Is still
the talk of the town, and his action Is be
ing discussed very freely by the citizens
of Xapa. Some people indorse his course
and say that he should have done a bet
ter Job than he didâ that he should have
used a hatchet, as Carrie Nation has
done. Others do not uphold the course
pursued by him in putting down the
liquor traffic In Napa,
Under Sheriff Daly and Constable Se

Farman, and took him to the Sheriff's
office ,' there to await the arrival of some
of his friends. The doctor would not ac
cept bnil, and said he would go to jail,
which he did last night, and will stay
there until his case comes up for trial,
unless he changes his mind about being
released on ball.
His friends endeavored Saturday iafter
noon to induce him, to receive ball and go
to his home, but this the doctor refused.
Mr. Farman admits that he premeditated
his act and knew It was wrong In the
sight of the law, but he claims that he
wants to test the constitutionality of the
law in licensing saloons, which are de
bauching boys and men-and wrecking the
homes of families, and that his act was
the only way to brine him Into court. He
said that he hoped his action would have

Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. 1405 O
STREET, N. AV., WASHINGTON*, Feb.
24iâ Important developments are expect
ed In the Venezuela asphalt controversy
within the next few days. Sir. Quinlah
of the Warner-Qulnlan Company has. ar
rived in Trinidad on his way to the scene
of the disturbance, and Is supposed to be
making preparations to take possession
of the company's claim by force, if pecea
sary, while the agents of the New York
and Bermudez Company in Guanaco ' are
reported to be arming for resistance and
building forts around the asphalt lake*.
It Â¦ is understood that while the Ber
mudez Company feels It would be Justified
In forcibly resisting the intrusion of In
dividual or outside companies upon the
tracts which it asserts are its own, it will
not forcibly oppose the Venezuelan troops
sent by President Castro.
General Castro lately issued a decree in
favor of the Warner-Quintan side of -the
controversy, and it was reported that he
intended to follow up the decree with
troops, but at last accounts from Vene
zuela he had not done so, and it is quite
possible he will not, .as he will soon have
an election on his hands, and perhaps an
other revolution.
However that may be, this Venezuelan
difficulty bids fair to develop into a ques
tion of grave political and international
Importance In the near future. So far as
the asphalt dispute Is concerned, the Im
portant point, in a national and interna
tional sense, Is that the controversy is
not between two rival American com
panies, but rather between an American
company and the Venezuelan Govern
ment, or the present Venezuelan Presi
dent, who Is practically the Venezuelan
Government, as he exercises dictatorial
powers.
It Is pointed out that the importance of
the asphalt\case Is greatly enhanced by
the fact tha\ the American Interests in
volved have been created and afforded
protection by the Venezuelan laws and
courts themselves. The legitimacy of
the status quo cannot be questioned from
the point of view of the officials who have
considered the case, and this protection
has been rendered of no avail by the
arbitrary action of the dictatorial ruler.

HONOLULU, Feb. 17.â The Board of
Health of the Territory has appointed a
committee to draft a bill, which it will
ask the Legislature to pass, . preventing
the landing on Hawaiian soil of any per
son afflicted with a contagious or infec
tious disease who is considered a menace
to the public health. This Includes con
sumptives. ,
The bill proposed by the Board of
Health Is a very drastic measure. A rough
draft submitted by Attorney General
Dole, a member of the board, provides
that all persons concerned in bringing
here a person affected by a contagious or
infectious disease may be fined and im
prisoned, including masters and owners of
vessels and friends or relatives who may
encourage the undeslred immigrants to
come. The invalids not wanted are to be
deported. *";.Â¦_
Some of the. features ofuie bill were
suggested by the case of the leper Pratt,
who came from San Francisco, and whom
the authorities found themselves power
less to send on any vessel if the. captain
objected. The China and the City of Pe
king refused to take him, but he was sent
on another vessel.

Board of Health Will Ask
for the Passage of a
â¢ Drastic Law.
Woodworth succeeds Frank L. Coombs,
Congressman-elect from California,
Much surprise was expressed In legal
circles in th's city yesterday over the ap
pointment of D. E. McKinlay as Assist
ant United States District Attorney, as It
was not supposed that he was a candi
date for the office, although his name
had been mentioned among those who as
pired to the position. Judson C. Brusle,
the attorney, i-olitieian and playwright,
was an avowed candidate for the post of
Assistant United States District Attorney.
It was generally understood that E. J.
Banning would be reappointed to the of
fice he has filled for the last two years.
Mr. Banning Is a Californian and is 30
years old. He was educated at St. Ig
natius College and graduated from that
institution. He studied law in the of
fice of Henley & Costello and at the Hast
ings I^aw College, from which he grad
uated.
HAWAII FEARS
CONSUMPTIVES
After being admitted to the bar, Mr.
Banning practiced law with Henley &
Costello for some years and then started
into business for hirtiself. â¢ In November,
1S38, when Judge Foote was United States
District Attorney, Mr. Banning and Mar
shall B. Woodworth were appointed as
sistants in the office, to succeed Bert
Schlesinger and Samuel Knight. When
Frank Coombs succeeded Judge Foote,
Messrs. Banning and Woodworth con
tinued as assistants to the United States
District Attorney.
Mr. Banning is popular with Federal
officials and the members of the legal
profession, and Judge de Haven of the
United States District Court has many
times complimented him on the able man
ner In which he has conducted Important
cases for the Government. His reap
pointment Is sure to be greeted with sat
isfaction.
â¢Duncan E. McKinlay, who will become
an assistant in the office of the United
States District Attorney, Is well known
in Sonoma County and In this city. He
formerly lived in Santa Rosa and was
a painter for many years before he
studied law. He practiced law in Santa
Kosa and four j'ears ago came to San
Krancisco. Air. McKinlay has been heard
all over the State as a political speaker,
and In 1S96 stumped the State for the
Republican party. In that year he was
placed on the electoral ticket by the Re
publican State Central Committee to fill
the vacancy caused by the resignation of
Colonel Crocker. Mr. McKinlay Is about
45 years ojd and Is a forceful speaker.

Mary, twins, aged 6, and George, aged 4.
When Marshal Hagerman heard Mrs.
Wurzer's cries he went to the mouth of
the well and asked "What's the matter?"
"I threw the children down the well,
and 1 am here, too," faintly responded
Mrs. Wurzer, in German. ,
"When did you throw them In?" asked
he.
â¢'La.Â«t night," was the reply.
The Marshal called for heip and neigh
bors soon gathered. Mr. Hanna, one of
these, was towered by a rope, lie placed
the rope about the woman and she was
haulcd-out. Then Mr. Hanna felt in tne
water for the children.
"I've found one," he cried. The re
mains were fastened to the rope and
pulled* out. One by one the other Uve
bodies were removed and laid side by
side on the bed. All were fully dressed,
even to their hats. In the pocket of one
boy was found an apple. A cut on one
boy"s lace and a black and blue spot
under the eye of a girl are the only marks
of violence! Marks on Mrs. Wurzer's
neck indicate that she had attempted
suicide by hanging, probably prior to
murdering her family.
Tho weil is thirty feet deep, and at its
top a wooden curbing narrows the en
trance to about twenty inches square.
Hence she must have used great force. 'to
squeeze the larger children through the
hole. It Is believed she must have
drugged them, as she is a slight, delicate
woman and the children were strong and
sturdy.
To The Call representative Mrs. Wurzer
talked rambllngiy. First she said she
killed the children because she thought
death preferable to poverty. Again she
declared she had read of Chinese atroci
ties and thought the Chinese would at
tack her household and slay her children.
She determined to cheat them of their
victims, and to drown herself. "I threw
four, in," she said again, "then one of
them jumped in .when 1 asked her to and
Rosa came of her own accord."
Three years ago her husband died,
leaving the family destitute. The county
has furnished $15 per month for their sup
port for some time. She" had been de
spondent for some time, but none of the
neighbors suspected such a terrible out
come I'eople from the country for miles
around are here, and the crime in all its
ghastly, details is the pole topic of con
versation. Ths 'woman will be taken to
the County Jail at Colfax to-morrow If
her physical condition permits. Two citi
zens report having seen Mrs. Wurzer on
the strret at 7 o'clock In the evening,
while one man is positive he *aw her at
8:30, and these facts lend color to the
theory that she had drugged th6 children
and was waiting for the little ones to
become helpless before thrusting them
down the well to death. She admitted to
the Marshal that. she had tried to kill
herself, but was unable. In the cramped
quarters to accomplish her purpose. It
was evident she had either stood or re
clined on the bodies of her dead children
all night and half the next day until ex
hausted nature called for relief and she
hailed the Marshal.
Mrs. Wurzer is about 35 years of age,
of dark complexion, black eyes and
weighs about 125 pounds, .being of medium
height. She is of a prepossessing appear
ance, and never before gave evidences
Of Insanity. The family lived in their own
home, insubstantial brick house of four
rooms. the death of the father
three yearo ago friends In the . country
have been most kind and have brought
donations of food and clothing. Mrs.
Wurzer never wanted for anything neces
sary to decent existence. Bhe was an in
dustrious woman of good education, par
ticularly In music. She endeavored to eke
out an existence In adOition to the little
appropriation given by Â¦ the county by
taking music scholars. When times
were good she gave lessons on the
guitar. She also played the piano. The
children attended school regularly. They
were present Friday afternoon and par
ticipated in the Washington's birthday
exercises.
Principal Savage of the public schoof
says the children were bright in their
lessons; were always fair In their de
portment, and their mother kept them
dressed I neatly. There was no lncum
brance on their home. The family seems
to tfave had no relatives In America, as
Mrs. Wurzer Is not known to have
spoken of 4ny relatives nearer than Ger
many.

both flies full to ovcrflowlne of
bills and every one predicting that
even the big measuree cannot be got
through in time the Assembly adjourn"
for three days and the Senate for two and
a half â cause, an excess of patriotism, and
a disinclination to work. The Assembly
adjourned from Thursday night to Sr.tur
day morning, and having done that its
members proceeded to get leayes of ab
sence until Monday morning, which had
the effect of relieving them of the neces
sity for showing up and at the same time
saving for them, the much-prized per diem.
The Senate â¢ celebrated Washington'B
birthday by the conslOeration of a special
fete of constitutional amendments, but
even that could not nold the members of
the upper ho.use longrer than noon. It is
a long time since a Legislature has had at
this time in the session so few important
bills that it cannot draw a quorum on a
Saturday.
In the Senate there are about 600 bills
and in the Assembly 820. but in the whole
i bunch there Is not business enough to
i keep the session running a week did the
j members not shy at work and take to
I killing time. A whole day was wasted in
playing at censure, with Wittman, Wren
and Coffey as the excuse. Were there so
much earnestness and eloauence devoted
to code revision at least one of the coda
bills would have been 5n tho hands of the
Governor before now, but if any oise
should suggest that a day be devoted to
the consideration of code revision, some
member with a bill to prevent smoke from
rising would declare that his measure
wa* being buried and the day would be
[ spent in wrangling Instead.
The censure of the three men from the
' city was about as spectacular a farce as
I has been put on in the legislative hall?.
The objects of censure were described as
cringing and crestfallen and apologetic.
They were nothing of the kind. They knew
from the start that the worst that could
bo done was the passage of a vote of
censure, and when has this Assembly
I shown that its censure was worth brush
! ing off. Members on the floor were asked
j to vote for a resolution of censure, and so
"Chinatown has Â¦ never been no stirred
up as it Is now since Mr., Knowland and
his committee came down there to Inves
tigate. These bills introduced* by him
will aid greatly in ridding the State of
this blot upon Its fair name, and I ap
peal to tho Legislature to give us such
laws."
"My blood was stirred at that Investi
gation when the Mayor and tho Chief of
Police said they looked upon this form of
vice as a necessary evil. It was
a blasphemy on deceny. First these noble
men, guardians of the law, plead ignor
ance, and then when cornered they say
this vico is a necessary evil.
"The Chief of Police of San Francisco
said before the legislative committee that
the Chinese slave girls could come and
go as they please. He lied when he said
it. and he knew that he lied. His eyes
are so covered by the scales of heathen
dom that he can see no evil in China
town.
"A form of slavery more terrible and
grewsome than negro slavery Is present
In fair California. It exists within the
shadow of the Hall of Justice, while
men, Judges and to some extent the
Police Department of San Francisco have
been conniving at it.

He had an overcoat on his arm when
he lumped, but this he had thrown away,
and in answer to the calls of the men
on tho train he shouted that ha was
floating on his back and he begired them
to get a boat. He was whirled on past
the river steamer Modoc that Is lying
at the foot of K street, and her watch
man heard the man calliner for help as
the current bore him on. That was the
last seen or heard of him. Boats were
put out. but by the time tho first one was
afloat Bunper was far down the river.
Bunner was formerly employed in the
office of Hyde & Benson, Ran Fran
cisco, but for some time he has had an
office of his own on the corner of Leides
dorff and California streets. He is a
KTeat friend of Martin Kelly and is well
known .amonrr politicians, and he is alsr>
connected with mining interests through
property he owns in Tuolumne County.
He Is 44 years old and unmarried.
Bunner left his seat with his compan
ions, and. Calling the porter, he told him
to open the doors of the vestibule. The
porter warned him that the train was
on the bridge, but Bunner said he knew
the bridge well and he was going to get
out. Then the porter opened the .door.
Bunner went down the fteps of the car
and jumped off in the darkness, and then
thÂ« threo who had followed him heard
the splash as he disappeared in the river.
Dovoto was about to jump. too. a3 the
splash came, and he was only saved by
Jack Crowley. who caught him by the
coat as he swung forward.
Tho- water is higher than it has been
in years. It is but a few feet from the
bridge to its surface, anÂ«i it is rushing
along, until it bolls over the piers of the
bridge. Bunner was not hurt, but by
the time he came to the surface, he had
been carried below the bridge and his
friends could see him trying to swim.
Bunner was In the Pullman car Adana
with a party consisting of T. D. Rlordan,
Jack Crowley and James A. Devoto
They waited twenty or twenty-five min
utes for tne train to move, and then
Bunner said there was a footway along
the track and he was going 1 to get out
and reach the Sacramento side by that
means. There 13 really no footway on
the lower bridge. Above the track runs
the wagon way and beside that is the
footwa!k, but down where the track Is
there Is nothing but the rall3 and the
open ties.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2l.-Whlle the 10
o'clock train from the city was stalled on
the bridge to-night John C. Eunner, a
San Francisco man and one well known
in business and political circles, stepped
from the car. platform and dropped into
the river. He was caught in the fierce
current and was carried along, calling for
help and answering the shouts of his
friends still on the train. The moon was
shining on the river and he could be
seen struggling in the muddy waters un
til finally he dntted out of sight and his
voice was heard no more*. There is but
little hope that he has escaped death.
The 6 o'clock overland from San Fran
cisco carried a number of legislators and
politicians returning to the capital, and
with them was Bunner. The train reached
the bridge on time, but after the engine
had crossed it was derailed by a loose
1 iog just off the bridge on the Sacra
mento side and the train came to a
standstill with all tne cars still on the
bridge.

U iih his logbook before him this after- i

story of his fearful experience at sea.
"We had gone to Japan with a cargo of ;
petroleum trom New York. ar.d. having
completed cur discharge and taken ballast !
lor a tru> to Portland to load wheat, we
âfled down the harbor of Yokohama on. i
the 15th of lasi Â¦ November. The weather;
had betn squally, but we were hardly pre- j
pared for what struck us three cays lattr. |
when we ran into the wildest storm of a ;
hurricane. We had plenty of wind before
then, and were running under shortened !
tail, with the lower topsails cJued up '
close. Nevertheless the wind took out :
seme of our canvass ana the compass j
lamp was put out. The steersman was '
ordered to hold to the course, but he let. i
the ship fall off until the sails backed and j
tore out, one after ar.othtr. The storm j
was followed by the most terrible sea I i
have ever experienced and the ship ia- i
bored fearfully.
"On the ISta the storm abated and we j
ber.t our sails anj rnado some progress, j
but on the morning of the 27th, in latitude ;
42 north, and US east, another storm i
struck the vessel with hurricane roree.

. ins -c-eek *vas better, but it did not last. I
In. <;â¢ north, 174 wef>t, on the 5th of De- !
cembei "we were struck by a very heavy i

ship leaking, exceedingly heavy weather, j

O'clock the wind changed to the west- I
Â¦otttawest*. ar.d we jay quiet for a time, I
tut at 7 o'clock there was another change
to the pouth-southeast and we got the
worst there was in the box. Tne seas
increased, the wind Hew stronger than I
ever end the ship rolled more heavily.
At 3Â° o'clock the main upper topsail went '
and the ship hauled over until the water !
was up over the sidvs and as far on the
deck as the. sides of the hatches, while*
the lewrr boats in the forecastle were
filled. The fore and the maingalla-nt
masts broke and the maintopsail yards !
went by the board. The foremast brok.? 'â¢
half way ~up and the maintopmast broke
ehort at ihe top.
"The foretopmast came down and hung Â¦
by the yards, pounding against the eldes â¢.
of the ship arsd on the deck. It was !
hours before we could get rid of it. and it (
is a great wonder that some of the men I
were not carried owi board. .The main- I

Thi main .parts went over the side with- !
out stoppir.E and the mizzen yards came j
down on top of the cabin and came near !
beating it to kindling vood. The mizzen, i
yard hung Jn it* socket and could neither
be stayed up nor cast overboard. When
its stays rroke they lifted another qf the
lioats overboard, and the last boat went
two days later, wl>en the mizzenmasf

"The fury of the storm lasted several

it woutd be almost impossible to reach
Portland with the small amount of sail
we could spread and we kept well to the
pr-uth, hoping to make San Francisco.
About Christmas time we were met by
fevere winds from the east, which drove
us back, and with our light sails we made
little or no progress for elg-hteen days.
We still hoped to make San Francisco
and tried to keep a course about 150 mile.*

B. E. Jacobs, officiating rabbi at San

eight years ago.

This statement struck deep to Mr. Drv
foos' heart because he was devoted to
his wife and their home had been a very
happy one. The husband and dying wife
were heart to heart when she lapsed into
unconsciousness, from which she passed
to death.
The second one had passed entirely
through Mrs. Dryfoos' body, inflicting a
mortal wound.
The physicians revived the wounded
woman, and Dr. Carroll said:
"Why did you shoot yourself?" /
"My husband docs not love me," she
replied.
In the wall of the room opposite one
mirror was one bullet and in the wall
opposite another mirror was another bul
let.

foos took a carriage and was driven
home. Mrs. Dryfoos was found lying on
the floor in a semi-conscious condition,
and bleeding from a large wound just be
low the heart. Her husband's large 45
caliber Elx-shooter lay near her with two
cartridges exploded.
Mrs. Dryfoos Immediately went to her
room, after telling- her husband not to
come "home. Soon two loud reports were
heard, one following the other with a
short Interval intervening. The servants
were greatly alarmed, and immediately
called up Mr. Dryfoos by telephone.
"Come home as quick as you can." was
the message. "Something terrible has
happened. There has been a loud explo
sion in Mrs. Dryfoos' room and I fear
she has shot herself."
Mrs. Dryfoos laid her hand on his j
shoulder, and calling him by his first I
name, said, "No. no: you have always ,
b*Â»en a g-ood and kind friend, but go." \
As Dr. Bories went out of the door he |
was impressed with the idea that Mrs.;
Dryfoos was not in her right mind. At !
3:45 o'clock Mrs. Dryfoos culled up her }
husband by telephone. "You need not :
come home to dinner. I will not be here," I
she said.
"Have I done anything to offend you |
that you should speak like that?" said the i
doctor. I
Mr. Dryfoos spoke comforting words I
and went to the store. This was a little i
after 3 o'ciock. Mrs. Dryfoos telephoned
to rome cf her friends, saying that she j
was going: on a lens Journey, and that she
would like to see them. Some she simply j
asked to call. Among the latter number ;
was Dr. Emil Bories, the family physi- <
clan. When Dr. Borles arrived at tha
house Mrs. Dryfocs said she was going I
away and wanted to say good by. Dr. i
Bcrlff supposed that Mrs. Dryfoos was [
ill when phe telephoned, end remarked
that he thought he would be going.
"Well, there is the door," 6aJd Mrs. Dry
foos.
"You invariably are busy when I want
you to go out with me," replied Mrs. Dry-
IOOE.
"I would bo gladly," replied Mr. Dry- j
fos8, "if possible, but I have several mat
ters to look after at the store, and have
made an appointment with a man on a

SENATOR HOAR'S SERMON.
SENATOR HOAR'S address before the General
.Court of Massachusetts on Lincoln's birthday
appears to have been a sermon 011 the depravi
ties of the time, closing with an expression of san
guine faith in the final redemption of the country
from all the evils that threaten it. He referred not to
political evils only, but to those in th'e business world
and in social life, and presented a picture so somber
that had he not given utterance to a wholesome op
timism in the end he would have been in danger of
being denounced as a calamity howler.
The vigor of the address may bc estimated from
some of the salient passages. Speaking of corruption
in politics he said: "The whipping-post, the brand
ing on the forehead, the cropping of the ears, the
scourging at the cart's tail, are light punishments for
the rich man who would, debauch a State v whether
it be an old State with an honorable history ' or a
young and pure* State in the beginning of its his
tory." Referring to crimes against society and the
infrequency of punishment, he said: "To-day crimes
against human life and against female chastity are
committed with impunity by men of the purest Puri
tan blood, in rural communities, and they go unde
tected and unpunished." â¢ ". - â¢
Passing to a consideration of the growth of dis
honesty and of excessive speculation in the business
world; he went on to say: "The spirit of gambling
which prevails everywhere, not only among the prac
ticed gamblers on the stock exchange, but through
brokers is carried on by widows with their little for
tunes, tempts the trustee and the treasurer and the
bank officer with his humble salary, so that embez
zlement, in many cases followed by no disgrace or
public censure, is growing and increasing fearfully
throughout Massachusetts."
In addition to these crimes of a private nature
the Senator found much to condemn in the action of
the nation toward the negro and the Filipino. Talking
of the various problems of race that confront us he
said: " I believe the solution of this difficulty is to b c
found in the golden rule and in the great Declaration
which is but the application of the golden rule to the
conduct of. states. If the white man will take
these for his guides when he deals with the negro and
the Indian, if America will take these for her rule cf
action in dealing with weak foreign nations, the diffi
culties that beset us will disappear. . If We do not, as
sure as Qod livcth, however the weaker races may suf
fer, the penalty will fall upon 113."
After so much of warning the Senator added: ; "I
have an abiding conviction that all these clouds which
hover over us will disappear." Such faith is gratify
ing, but it will be of no avail unless the people take
to heart the Wesson of the growing evils and strive
to put an end to them. No man in the nation is bet
ter fitted to .speak on such subjects than Senator
STATE DIVISION QUESTIONS.
QUESTIONS affecting the division of States
rarely become practical issues in American
politics. In the early days of the republic an
issue of the kind was brought up by the struggle of the
people of Maine to separate from Massachusetts, arid
during the war Virginia was divided and the State of
West Virginia created. Since then there have been no
changes. It was long thought that the people of
Texas would seek, to obtain more power in the Senate
by dividing their immense territory into several com
monwealths, but a State patriotism has held them
together. In California there -has been much talk
from time to time of State division, but nothing has
ever come of it. Here, as in Texas, there is a local
pride in the magnitude of the State, and few except
politicians would be willing to destroy the unity of
California for the sake of getting two additional mem
bers of the United States Senate.
From unexpected sources there have come two
movements for the divisions of States which have
gone far enough to amount to something like issues
of practical politics,, and it is not improbable they
may come before Congress in the near future. One of
these is the transfer of a large portion of West Florida
to Alabama. The people, not only of the section in
question but of both States, appear to be favorable" to
the plan. State conferences have been held, and it i3
likely an agreement for the separation will soon be
reached and submitted to Congress for ratification.
The other movement under consideration is that of
dividing Kentucky so as to give the people of the
mountains a State government of their own. The
inhabitants of the two sections of the State have never
lived in harmony. When the rich blue-grass section
followed Henry Clay and the Whig party the moun
taineers were Democrats, but when the blue-grass
country became Democratic the mountains became
Republican. The intense partisan differences betwes.i
the two sections disturb -the State government and
materially interfere with the administration, of justice.
So the project for division finds a good deal of sup
port. .
It is recalled that at the time Kentucky was admit
ted to the Union it was expected a separation of the
State would eventually take place. In fact, there was
an agitation for it at the time the Territory was ad
mitted to statehood, ?nd it was then suggested that
the mountain district' be known as Transylvania.
Something of the difference of development
has occurred between the people of Eastern and West
ern North Carolina, of. Eastern and Western Tennes
see, and before the war there was 'an '.almost, equal
division between the mountaineers 'of North Georgia
anditheslaveholders.Jn the central and southern por
tions of;the State. Those old differences appear to
have been healed everywhere except in Kentucky. The
Florida case is almost certain to be soon brought be
fore the country, and when it arises the force of ex
ample may encourage the Kentucky agitators to make
a move for separation there.
MARKED EXPANSION IN BUSINESS.
THE weekly commercial reports last week showed
a continued healthy condition of trade. While
severe weather retarded the movement of mer
chandise in some sections of the North and West, the
country as a -.vhole reported greater activity than dur
ing the corresponding week in 1000. This is corrob
orated by the bank cicarings, which increased 60 per
cent, even- city of importance exhibiting a gain, some
of them noteworthy. The gain at New York was 72.fi
per cent, at Boston 31.2, at Chicago 28.1, at Philadel
phia 63.3, at St. Louis .63.1, at Pittsburg 81, at San
F rancisco 62, and so on down a long list of twenty of
the largest cities in the United States. No better
record than this could be desired. The country's
tiilures were 219, against 168 for the same week last
year.
This large increase in business is not due to any
particular booni, ' but seems, to be well distributed
among the different staples. The- continued cold
weather east of the Rockies has been of great benefit
to jobbers and retailers carding large stocks, and
they have been enabled to reduce them materially.
Then the dry goods trade is reported in much better
condition, and boots and shoes are selling well all
over the country, The particularly good demand for
lumber and other building material leads to the ex
pectation that building operations during the. cominjr
spring viill be extensive. The iron and steel industry
is trill very sctiye. as tho.wa by the large clearings at
Pittsburg, and further advances are reported in some
descriptions. In many respects this trade is better
off than at any' time since the depression of a year
ago. The export trade, however, is slack, and foreign
iron and steel are reported easing off in price. Coffee
end tea are selling better. Wool is in a peculiar con
dition, for while the volume of sales is steadily increas
ing prices are '.veakening, and the demand for woolen
jroods is not what it ought to be. The sales seem to
be for [speculative account, based on the feeling that
prices have nearly reached bottom, though this U
merely trade opinion arid may or may not prove cor
rect. " Neither is the cotton industry in any better
shape. In spite of the recent reduction in prints there
is no activity, and many mills are restricting opera
tions, while a number announce that they will close
down on the 1st of March. The' Northwestern rail
road?, on the contrary, report a very heavy movement
of general merchandise and farming implements over
their lines.
Wall street has lagged somewhat during the past
few days, principally owing to the uncertainty regard
ing the final details of the mammoth steel combina
tion, and the tendency has been to short the market.
There has been a marked withdrawal of the public
from purchasing, and once more, the professionals
have the market pretty much to themselves. A good
feature of the situation, however, is the reduction of
the discount rate of the Bank of England" from 414
per cent to 4 per cent, showing an easier money mar
ket in London. Thus, taking the country as a whole,
if speculation in Wall street and the unsatisfactory
condition of the cotton and woolen trades be excepted,
it -viill : be seen 'that .American business is looking
exceptionally w-dl .at present]
On tins cofest there is Httfe new to report. General
trade in California is aJ good as at any time during the

kindred subjects. . ,
From 1S71 to 1S74 tie planned and con
structed the famous Sny Carte levee In
the Illinois bottoma above St. Louis. The
remarkable influence of this work upon
the channel of the river attracted the at
tention of many famous engineers. Among
these was James li. Eads, and from the
time of his meeting with Mr. Corthell an
ardent friendship begun, which terminat
ed only with the former's death. Mr.
Cort hell's next great work was the con
struction of the Chicago and Alton bridge
across the Mississippi at Louisiana. Mo.
Here again he -achieved celebrity, for the
span of his bridce. 444 feet, was then the
largest In the world and the structure as
a" whole was recognized as marking an
advance in railway bridge building. Lace
in 1S74. in company with Mr. Eads. he vis
ited the delta of the Mississippi for the
purpose of preparing a report outllnln?
for the national Government the advisa
bility and feasibility of constructing Jet
ties. The Volume which Mr. CorthcH
wrote on this subject Is recognized the
world overas a standard authority. "When
the contract in the South Pass was award
ed to Mr. Eads he placed Mr. Corthell in
charge of the engineering and construc
tion work. It was the success of this fa
mous undertaking which produced a cnan
nel of thirty feet deDtn at the month of
the Mississippi and made New Orleans a
great sÂ«anort.
Then with his frlen'd Eads he began the
famous surveys of the mouth of the Coat
zacoalcos river and of the Pacific Coast
harbors, which 'offered feasible termlr.l
for the proposed interoceanlc ship rail
way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
Interested in Many Great Work3.
For some years Mr. Corthell was main
ly Interested !n building great railroad
bridges In the United States, chief of
which are the mighty structure across
the Ohio River at Cairo and the Mer
chants' bridge across the. Mississippi Riv
er at- St. Loui*. The former, which is the
property of the Illinois Central Railroad.
!.â¢Â» not only the longest sloel bridge In the
world, but Is regarded ns? the most per
fect example of railroad l.rldge builc'lng.
In 1SS9 he conducted the examination?
and surveys of the moulh and harbor of
the Parmco Utver at Tamplco. Mexico,
and his reports to tho Mexican Govern
ment were so lucid and practical that he
was commissioned to Improve the harbor
Â¦with two parnl'el Jetties. His plans for
this vast undertaking wrre forrnulaled
only after ha bad vls!t<"l and surveyed
twenty-Six European harbors in search of
suRpestior.s. ThfÂ» complete triumph of hla
Â¦work was evident six months after its
installation at Tampico. when the chan
nel tor ships entering the -harbor had
deepened from eipht to twenty-six feet
over the tea bur. In 13?0 he examined the
water route between Quebec ai.'l the
American lake title-. In 1F91 he spent six
months in the leading universities and
technical schools of Europe studying their
methods with u view to establishing a
school of c ngin.e^rlnjr In the University or
Chicago. In 1S32. while in charge of the
National Railroad cf Tehuantepec. Mex
ico, he returned to Chlcajro to found the
engineering congress, which proved one
of the successful features of the "World's
Columbian Exposition and laid the basis
of an International society of engineers
and architects. He spÂ«nt 1S97 and 1S9S in
Europe studying harbor works, railroad
terminals, port facilities, mountain rail
roads, ship cancls and plans for the pro

gate of the United States Government to
the seventh International congress at nav

OUT of the hubbub of the Chinese imbroglio
there comes an: unexpected sound. Rising
high and loud over the wailirlgs of the, Chinese
amid their ruined home3 and looted palaces and
stores there is suddenly heard the roar of a lion's
voice. Sir Robert Hart, Chief of the Chinese Im
perial Customs, but none the less a British subject,
has risen in wrath to declare that the allies have looted
his property, and to demand immediate and ample
redress. " '. â¢""â¢
It appears from the statement of Sir Robert that
when the powers. began to" -seize property for the pur
pose of increasing the size'of the legation grounds in
Peking they were not at all careful of whose town lots
they took. The officers in charge of the duty of pre
paring rooms for the mansions, offices and gardens
of the various legations considered that they had a
right .to seize whatever they wished and, with a dis
criminating eye, they took the best â and they took a
whole lot of it. In doing so, Sir Robert says, they
took some property belonging to him.
If the statement of the irate Chief of the Imperial
Customs be true the affair will be regretted, by the
powers as an extremely unfortunate incident. It is
conceded ..that while it is right to loot a Chinaman it
is not right to loot a Christian. Moreover, Sir Robert
is not the kind of man who sits down and waits for
somebody to come along and loot him with impunity.
He is a kicker and a fighter. His demand for redress
is going to continue roaring through the camps an.-l
the courts of the allies until he gets justice.
When, however, the allies undertake to grant him
the redress he asks it will be necessary to set up some
sort of tribt'nal to assess damages. When the tribunal
begins its hearings what is to prevent a Chinaman or
two from appearing before it with a claim for dam
ages done by looters?- If redress is to be granted to
one, why not to another?
The new development in the Chinese situation made
public by Sir Robert's deman'd, while unexpected, is
not unnatural. When men in large masses once begin
to loot they soon lose good judgment. In the hurry to
seize spoil it is not always remembered that the looter
before looting should carefully inquire who owns the
property. Consequently it was inevitable that, in the
general frolic of grabbing, a good many Christian
residents and merchants in China should suffer a little.
When the grand pacification has been duly performed
and all is over there will doubtless appear at the
Chinese legations of all the great powers a stream
of good but sorry Christians, alleging that their prop
erty was made a part of the spoils of war along with
that of the heathen, and asking for damages.
To all good Christians who have been despoiled by
the allies the mishap that occurred in the looting of
Sir Robert Hart will appear as something like a
special providence. Men of little rank, wealth or influ
ence; if left to themselves, could hardly have gained a
hearing. ' Their chances of obtaining redress would
therefore have been small. Their prospects of redress
have therefore been greatly brightened by the unfortu
nate slip of the powers in looting Sir Robert. That
victim of a mistake is sufficiently powerful to compel
a hearing. For many a year past the British people
have been proud to the extent of a national vanity
over the fact that their Government protects its citi
zens in all parts of the globe. In the face of that
pride the British Ministry will be forced to make a
show at least of demanding redress for the wrong
done to this eminent representative of its citizens
in China, and out of the proceedings that will follow
there may come something of justice not only for him
but for many other sufferers. Consequently, as this
is a contrary world, the looting of the wrong man
may prove the means of righting a good -many
wrongs.
LOOTED THE WRONG MAN.
REPORTS from Washington announce that a
majority of the Senate Committee on Relations
with Cuba have agreed upon a policy of dealing
with the island which it is believed will prove satis
factory to the Senate and the administration. : The
outline of the plan given in the dispatches include?
these propositions:
That the United States ehall have supervision of all
treaties with foreign tountries made by the republic of
Cuba.
That Cuba shall not undertake to pay the debt In
curred by Spain In her war with Cuba prior t#or after
the intervention of the United States.
That Cuba shall agree either to lease or sell to the
United States such coaling and naval stations as In the
opinion of the President of the United States may be
necessary to the protection of the Interests of this
country.
That the United States shall have sufficient super
vision of the laws of Cuba relating to sanitation to pro
tect this country from epidemics liable to originate
there.
It will be perceived that while propositions of that
kind spell "protectorate"' they mean "sovereignty."
A country that cannot make a treaty without the con
sent of another power, that cannot determine for itself
what debts -it shall pay or leave unpaid, that is com
pelled to lease to another power whatever points of
its territory that other power may desire for naval or
coaling stations, and that has not control over its' own
domestic sanitation laws, is not a free country. The
constitution of Cuba may proclaim it an independent
nation, but if the United States asserts those powers
over it no nation in the world will recognize its inde
pendence.
Cuba is so close to our shores and holds such an
important strategic position in relation to the North
Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean
Sea that the United States must necessarily take a
keen interest in the island- and in all that affects the>
political condition of its people. It was upon those
grounds we justly interfered to put an end to Spanish
misrule in the island, and upon the same grounds we
must always be ready to prevent any foreign aggres
sion upon the island or any such anarchy as has be
fallen the people of Santo Domingo.
When all those things have been conceded there
remain grave objections to the plan of settlement
proposed by the Senate committee. Ample experi
ence has proven that "protectorates" are fruitful
sources of wars. The United States, in combination
with Great Britain and Germany, tried that form of
supervising the affairs of Samoa, and the complica
tions that arose even in a group of islands so far of!
and so comparatively unimportant came near to caus
ing war between the allies. In the end they resulted
in a partition of the islands between. the United States
and Germany, and that partition was in violation of
the most solemn treaties made by the three powers
with the Samoans.
Great- Britain tried the experiment of a protectorate
over the Transvaal on lines very much like those pro
posed for us to exercise over Cuba. In both cases the
protecting power claimed the right of supervising
and, if deemed best, forbidding any treaty between ths
protected country and a foreign nation. The result is
war. Great Britain, made another experiment in the
way of a protectorate in Egypt. The result there was
war, the occupation of the whole Egyptian territory
by British troops, the invasion of the Soudan, and
now the whole Nile region is virtually a portion of
the British empire.
History does not. always repeat itself. The failures
of the protectorates in Samoa, South Africa and
Egypt do not necessarily imply a failure of any pro
tectorate we may establish over Cuba, but they are
full of warning.
The defect that is inherent in the very nature of a
protectorate is that it places absolute sovereignty no
where and thus leads to confusion. On points where
the Cubans desire complete independence our super
vision will fret them. On points where we desire*
control their independence will fret us. In the end
there are sure to be misconceptions, friction and
strife. Of course, by following always the dictates of
justice and applying its principles with political saga
city and. high statesmanship we may carry a protec
torate over Cuba without bad results; but if we do we
will have achieved something never before achieved
either by ourselves or any other nation on. the globe
since the dawn of history.
THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA.
Hoar. He has come down to us from' the
times of the Givil War,- when politics was a matter of
moral conviction. He represents more nearly, pei
haps, than any other living statesman the spirit of
Lincoln, and consequently while we may rejoice in the
optimism of hi3 closing words we should not over
look the solemnity of the warning itself.

ence no difficulty in completing its pro

Kiel employed 50.000 men. besides which,
there were several other yards. The fact
is that Krupp's yard three months ago
employed less than 3500 men, and that the.
combined working capacity of all the
shipyards for naval work does not exceed
W.OCiO workmen. Furthermore, as tho
German naval programme involves a to

(This Eerie*, which Is under the direction of
president Andrew N. Draper of the Universi
ty of Illinois, will close with "A Study of
America's Opportunity," by Senator George
F. Hoar of ' Massachusetts.)
.There is not an engineer engaged In
studying or combating the obstacles
which" nature offers to man In all parts of
the world who does not know and esteem
the name and achievements of Elmer
Lawrence Cortholl.. Beginning in poverty
and frail health he long since won a fore
most place among the world's engineers,
and yet there are few living great men
who are less known by the contemporary
publlc. He is not rich In money, but the
reason lies midway between his lofty per
sonal- character and the noble quality of
his works. â¢
"The achievement of my profession, the
success of science as I understand it, is
more to me than money. In a certain
sense I am satisfied to work for the glory
of a great profession- and what little re
flected glory there may be for me." This
wns his answer to a friend who urged
him to ask greater fees for his wofk and
advice. The habit of his mind, the
nervous energy of his body and his en
thusiasm have enabled him to accomplish
an amount of work that would have ex
hausted or destroyed stronger men, and
it was the combination of these qualities
that founded and built up his success.
For thirty years it has been his habit to
keep a notebook under his pillow, so that,
waking In the night under stress of some
now thought, he could jot it down. He
said to an associate one day: "I believe
I'll have my stenographer sleep in the
daytime and sit up all night. I have ray
best thoughts in the nlgnt and I'm too
busy to dictate during the day."
Some Characteristic Incidents.
His daughter was a student at Welles
ley College, when her sight began to fall
and she was compelled to leave. Mr.
Corthell, grieving over her affliction, yet
saw in it a chance to help some one and
with her aid selected a poor, ambitious
girl whom he sent to fill the place at col
lege made vacant by the departure of his
own child. The number of aspiring, un
friended young surveyors and engineers
whom he helped to start In the profession
of which he was master will never be
known, but it is said that more railroad
contractors, surveyors and rising masters
of bridge construction owe their success
to Elmer L. Corthell than to any other
single Influence. His son, Howard L.
Corthell, now with the Illinois Central
Railroad Company, following his father's
profession. Is onÂ© his youngest proteges.
It Is a singular coincidence that his .son,
.then a student at Brown Universityâ his
father's alma materâ enlisted as a private
in the First Rhode Island Infantry for
service in the late Spanish war, even as
the elder Corthell had left the same col
lege thirty-five years before to serve with
the Rhode Island Artillery in the Civil
War.
A few years ago a malignant disease
attacked Mr. Corthell. He went to
Switzerland to consult an eminent special
ist, and in the presence of an interested
gallery of surgeons and one of his own
friends was informed that the only way
to save his life was to remove one of his
eyes.
"All right, doctor," quietly replied the
patient: "I am ready whenever you are."
A student of Immense courage, one
whose business since boyhood has denied
him for much of the time the delights of
his home, a man of rare gentleness, he
has yet successfully lived at variance with
all his weaker, natural traits. Forever
plotting and fighting against the hostility
of seas, rivers and mountains, exiled by
foreign commissions that kept him for
months at a time in strange lands, he has
lived a life of self-denial that is not ex
pressed in his good-humored face and
cheerful smile.
Although he has spent so much time in
places where fteh and wild animals
abound, it is said by his friends that he
never owned or used a fishlne-rod or u
fowllng-plece, never wantonly killed a
creature of forest or stream. Horseback
riding is his favorite recreation.
In April, 1900. he was married at Berne,
Switzerland, to Miss Marie Kuchler of
that city, going thence to Buenos Ayres
In South America, where he expects to
remain till the end of 1901. To survey ana
control the fierce currents of the Rio de
la Plata, if Mr. Corthell adheres to hi*
present resolve, will be the final engin
eering work of his remarkable career, for
he promises his friends to return to vNew
York within a year and settle down at
last to his home, his books and the writ
ings which the scientific world expects as
his legacy to future students.
The Struggle for an Education.
He was born at South Ablngdon, Mass.,
midway between Bunker Hill and Ply
mouth Rock, on September 30, 1840. His
earliest American ancestor was Robert,
Corthell, a native ojf Scotland, who set
tled at Hingham. Mass., In the early days
of New England. His father was James
Lawrence Corthell, the son of a revolu
tionary soldier. Elmer was a bookworm
at 9 years and so absorbed was he in
study that his father's favorite method
of punishing him was to take away his
books and compel him -to play or sit idle
An early fondness for constructing 1 com
plicated mechanical toys Indicated the
bent of his talents. While going to the
little district school of South Abingdoi
he helped support his family and earned
money to pay for his clothing. By hard
work and pinching economy he was able
to enter and maintain himself at Phillips
Academy. In 1859 he entered Brown Uni
versity, where for two years he studied
and paid his way by coaching youngar

CHIHUAHUA, Mexico, Feb. 24.â Grant
Gillette, the once millionaire cattle king
of Kansas, has shaken the dust of Mex
ico off his feet and has returned to the
United States. Gillette came here from
Kansas City two years ago, an exile
frpm the United States because of un
paid accounts in the Kansas City stock
markets. It is said that he "worked"
the dealers and banks there for nearly
$1,000,000 and came here before the ex
tradition treatv went into effect. After
coming to Mexico Gillette engaged in
different lines of .business, but failed in
every undertaking. From a millionaire
he fell to a man of ordinary circum-
Btandes and later to one'of almost pov
erty.- Mrs. Gillette, who has been run
ning a millinery store here for more than
a year, made some money, but dissatis
faction with life here made her long to
return to her former home. Last week
she sold her establishment and with her
little- boy .returned to Kansas.
Gillette accepted a position with a firm
here after failing in the hay business,
but after his wife left he said he could
stand It no longer and would return
home himself.' He boarded a southbound
train a few days ago, saying he was go
ing to Torreon. It has just been learned,
however, mat he did not gf.t off at Tor
reon, but went to Syracuse, where- ne
purchased a steamer ticket for New
York. From New York he will return
to Kansas am settle his affajrs. Gillette
said' to friends before- he left that his
wife had agreed- to sell all of her prop
erty in Kansas and with that money he
would pay 50 cents on the dollar of - his
Indebtedness.
Gillette's disappearance nearly two
years apo created a tremendous sen
ration when the amount of his defalca
tions became known.- He had been one
of the most 'successful cattle raisers arid
speculators in the. -West and in palmy"
days had spent money lavishly and lived
l!ke a prince. After the crash it was
estimated that he took $100,000 with him
when he fled. For a time his disappear
ance was complete, but after a month or
fo he turned up here and bought a hotel.
Thia venture failed and he went from
bad to worse until his wife finally Joined
him. in exile, and, to sonnort the* family,
opened a fashionable- millinery establish
ment in -Chihuahua, which she conducted
until last week.- Gillette and his wife
were, quite popular with the American
colony in Chihuahua.
While . here- the -exile led a sober life
and devoted most of his time to his fam
ilv. He often threatened to return to
Kansas City and expose numerous frauii
unlent transactions' of which he was ac
cused.- He said other persons who J had
never been suspected had made a scape
goat out of him to conceal frauds perpe
.trated' by themselves.

Unless Lieutenant of Marines Richard
M. Cutts spends a considerable portion of
his salary in the purchase of obesity pills
and Indulges in exercise of the sort rec
ommended to those who, are greater in
breadth than in length he will prove a
source of much difficulty to the design
ers and builders of Uncle .Sam's mighty
vessels of war.
Lieutenant Cutts possesses proportions
that may be likened unto those of a cer
tain military hero, but unlike the latter
has still the elasticity of youth. When he
received orders to report on board the
battleship Wisconsin he expanded con
siderably, and it is Just possible that on
account of this expansion- his troubles
arose.
Over the door of a stateroom on the
Immense vessel was a neat brass plate
Informing those aboard that space on the
other side of the door was to be devoted
to the marine officer, but when the pon
derous form of the lieutenant appeared
on the gangway, his fellow officers looked
aghast Carefully- scanning the brass
door plates as he marched down- the pas
sageway, Cutts stopped when he reached
the slgrn that informed him that he had
reached his quarters.
This being the first Â¦ vessel to which
Lieutenant Cutts had been ordered, he
became visibly affected upon viewing the
quarters that were to be all his. But the
lieutenant was not to have the pleasure
and satisfaction of occupying the room
Just then. An Ignorant draughtsman, in
arranging the entrance, figured on a man
of ordinary build, and in consequence
Cutts. who is much more than ordinary
found it impossible to enter his room.
Straight ahead, sideways, backwards, it
was the same: The door was not large
enough to allow the marine officer en
trance to his "castle." . Â¦
Ar hasty consultation was held, with a
result that the ship's carpenter was given
whispered instructions. The Bound of
hainmcr and saw wielded by muscular
tatooed arms was soon to be heard com
ing from the' direction of the marine offi
cer's room, and a glimpse of Lieutenant
Cutts could be had sUting in the captain's
cabin, surrounded by dress suit and sword
cases, and with a look of anxiety on his
face. He was on pins and needles .for
many hours, but allowed a grin of satis
faction to creep over his countenance
when the carpenter's .mato announced
"It Is big enough now. sir."

"dropped Into poetry," declaring that the
matchless Oelrichs calves, encased in
black silk stockings, were 4 a poem." Lota

they lacked the poetic young woman's

Alice Hager went ono steD farther than
her "black" companions by braving the
vise committee In the gorgeous get-up of
Kate Hardcastle in "She Stoops to Con
quer." Miss Hager's maid accompanied
her to the ball, helped her doff the mag
nificent pink brocaded Hardcastle drers
and fit herself out as "Aunty." It was
the most marvelous lightning change
scene that I ever expect to witness. It
was all done In five minutes and the best
of It all was that the other ladles In the
dressing-room did not know what was
happening. They looked in wonder when
they saw "Aunt Jemima" corns from be
hind the. screen, behind which the vision
in pink had Just disappeared.
The minute they all got on the floor
they started the fun ar.d the mystery. Not
a soul divined who they were and by dof
fing their make-up and homely gowns Just
before the hour of unmasking and appear
ing at supper in gorgeous raiment they
kept everybody a-guessing.
Maybe the bunch of Aunt Jemimas
didn't have a fine time at the Mardi Gra-s!
They were Alice Hager. Ethel Haprer,
Mollle Thomas, Carrie Taylor. Theresa
Morgan, Ella Morganâ I have forgotten
the names of the other girlsâ and they
looked like the real Southern thing"? in
their brown hollands, bright Kerchiefs and
fantastic head dress. All the small girls
of the Jolly septet had wondrous kinky
wlgrs on, with the hair done up In mult!
tudinous little tight braids, all tied with
brilliant bits of ribbons. They had their
gowns buttoned down the back and lookei
just the sauciest wenches. As for the big
girls, they had caps â snowy muslin affairs
â over their pretty coiffures, and looked so
genuine that with Just the least bit of im
agination you could smell hoe cakes as
they passed.
Ar.d it Is to Mrs. Henry Scott thct we
owe it all. It was a hard flcht to make
and it met with many adverse criticisms,
but the lady persisted bravely to the end.
Just as she did when It vai a question of
who might enjoy 'the hospitality of the
Burllngame club room?. Two noble vic
tories! I think a title of distinction
should be conferred upon the lady. Mlgh'
I suggest: Mr?. Henrv T. Scott, "most
worthy censor of morals."
Naturally there have been heaps of peo
ple who have declared that the spirit of
the- carnival was miasine at our bal'.
Wei!, that is all a matt-sr of how one
looks at these things. But there is no one
who can say the girls should have re
mained "to home." They were all there,
debutantes included, and there was noÂ»
even one chaperon who, on Ash Wednes
day, felt she had reason to reproach her
correct self for lack of proper Judgment.
1 BELIEVE that we are. all of us. a
most ungrateful lot. We have had our
MardI Gras, enjoyed it and have neg
lected to thank the lady who made It
the decent success that it was. I re
fer, of course, to Mrs. Henry T. Scott. She
is the lady who insisted on the dictum
that raen should not wear masks.

Yesterday afternoon the Italian colony
in Ban Francisco gathered together at
the Tivoli Opera-house to do honor to the
memory of the great , Italian maestro,
Verdi. The hall where the favorite and
beloved operas of the master have been
bo familiarly heard for twenty-one years
was filled to its utmost limit by the com
patriots and lovers of this greatest of
Italian composers. The. decorations were
lavish and effective. Draped with black
and garlanded with green, shields bearing
the titles of Verdi's most Important
works were hung round the galleries.
From the center of the stage was hung
a portrait of the "grand old man of
Italy," on the left a picture of the mod
est cottage where he was born and to the
right another of the "Home for Aged Mu
sicians," whtah Milan owes to the splen
did generosity of the composer.
The service opened with an impressive
rendering of the "Nabucco Symphony;"
under the direction of Giulio Minettl, by
a large orchestral force, after which
Mayor Phelan delivered the English
eulogy of the dead composer. He said in
part:
It has been suggested that this is an occa
sion of deepest sadness, of unrelieved gloom;
but may we not consider it as the triumph of
genius over death, the victory of that which
1b Immortal? Verdi was. of the master minds
of the century, its greatest Italian composerâ
perhaps its greatest world composer. His Is
music and melody to live with, "not too bright
and good for human nature's daily food."
He haw sounded the gamut of all human emo
tions. Here, In a clime and country closely
resembling the skies and seas of his native
land, where the blood of the Latin has al
ready aroused a love of music only second to
that of sunny Italy itself, wo have an es
pecial, right to grieve and rejoice at tho
death and triumphs of the great Italian.
But it Is a world loss, as his music has
been tho delight of all civlllied nations. From
St. Petersburg to San Francisco, the grief
and Joy are shared â the allegiance of love to
the benign rule of genius acknowledged, and
we must thank the Italian citizens that here
we have been thus intimately' permitted to
Join in the tribute to their great countryman.
As a man, an a citizen, he was of no lest
measure than as a musician. His artistic ca
reer was a steady progress until his death at
86, in the tenlth of his fame, and his life
work a contribution of highest worth to the
brilliant roll of artistic achievement given to
the world by the genius of his country.
The Mayor was loudly cheered through
out by the enthusiastic worshipers pres
ent.
The Italian oration was delivered by
Chevalier J. Calegarls, who voiced the
Italian sentiment . of the occasion in
graceful fashion. The following were the
remaining musical numbers:

"The Village Parson," a religious and
dramatic play, is holding the boards at
the California and should do a good
weeks business. A clever company has
teen gathered together by Manager
the brunt of the dramatic
work falllr.g to E. Laurence Lee as the
Rev. Tom CJodley. Through the machina
tions of two brothers â Gordon, Imperson
ated by William Webb, and Charles de
Boise â Godley feels called upon to turn
his wife and baby from their nappy home,
and on that the trouble hinges. Miss
Anna Viola. Risher as the wife displays
good acting ability and also shows her
self to bÂ© the possessor of a fine voice,
which was heard to advantage in "The
Holy City," sung behind "the scenes.
Josie McMahon plays Myrtle Godley, the
blind child, with extreme nicety,
and the fun of the piece was contributed
by Mrs. George W. Barnum, whose Ger
man comedy was very clever in the part
of Gretchen Van Crans. Scott Lawrence
as Andy Thom helped out very accept
ably In the humorous situations.
6unday matinee* will be discontinued
at this house, as only the best attractions
will be presented.

Howard Hall produced his drama. "A
Husband's Honor." last night at Moros
oo's Theater. It is based on the old story
of an ur.faithf.ul wife, her detection and
subsequent punishment. In the third act.
a scene presenting a gambling pavilion
near Monte Carlo affords Adgie an op
portunity of performing with her lions.
While Aclpie is in the cage the betrayer
of the wife gains possession of a note in
tended for the discarded husband. Hall,
who plays the part of the husband, de
mands that It be surrendered to him. The
note is tossed into the cage during a
pcufn> ar.d Hall gains pt-sse?sion of It by
r.a.Â«=h.rg into the cage. This feature of
the play aroused the enthusiasm of â¢ the
gallery gods. The honors of the perform
ance were divided between Adgie, Hall.

ment. 6-2, 4-6. 8-6. Rosenberg was tired
out after his hard match with Smith, and
with the heavy handicap against him he
was unable to win the final match. Kuehn
played a remarkably steady game
throughout. The first set was won by
Kuehn rather easily, the score being 6-2.
In the second ret Rosenberg took a brace
and won, 6-4, but the effort was too great,
und after a fierce struggle the last set
finally fell to Kuehn, 8-6. Each of the
players in the finals received a handsome
silver stein for his efforts. This is the
first time a handicap tournament has
been won by a fifth class man.

D. Bodle became gay In the ninth Inn
ing of the game played yesterday at
Recreation Grounds between the Koenigs
and the Xobles. The score was 7-6 In favor
of the Koenigs, there were two men tomb-
Etoned. and Jagger was on his way to
second for a steal.' Eager threw the ban
to Bodle. 1 who covered the bag. but Bodle
lost himself In fanciful stunts and grand
stand baseball, Jagger reaching the bag
and the game being prolonged for many
extra lnnines. The gamowas finally won
in the thirteenth by the Koenigs.
From the ninth to the thirteenth neither
side scored, but In this Inning Keoghan
reached first on Walters' error, second on
Perrine"a out, and scored on Collins' clean
two-bagger to left.
Altogether the game was a close and
fast one. The pitching of Perrine and
Shea was of fine quality, and their sup
port was excellent, but a few errors be
ing made. Tyson batted the ball over
the right-field fence in the ninth for a
home run. Score:.

proved to be Charles Kuehn, fifth
class man. .
The semi-final match between Al Rosen
berg and Grant Smith brought out the
finest tennis of the tournament. By mu
tual agreement the match was made the
best three sets in five, instead of .two out
of three. Rosenberg won by the complete
score of 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 and 7-5. Had the
match been two sets out of three Smith
would have been the winner, as the score
shows. Smith won the ' first set easily
â¬-2. The second set fell to Rosenberg by
the score of 6-3. Then Smlttt braced up
and won the third set, 6-3. With two sets
to his credit it looked aa if Smith would
win the match, but 'Rosenberg, who is
noted for his staying powers, won tha
next set, 6-2. In the last set Smith had a
lead of 3-1; but was too tired to win out.
and after some ] fast and brilliant rallies
Rosenberg won the last set by the score
of 7-5.
The final match, between Charles Kuehn
and Ar Rosenberg, was two sets out of

JAMES TAKES FIRST
GAME FBOM CAETWBIGHT
Clever Handball Flayers Contest in
the Courts of the Olympic
Club. . .
George James has a slight lead over
William Cartwrlght for the sliver trophy
offered by Messrs. Melrose and Ramsdell
to go to the winner of a series of hand
ball games between these two experts.
James yesterday "defeated Cartwright in
their Initial game, and If he wins on
Wednesday evening the cup will be his
property.
Quite a large ' number of clubmen
watched the match game yesterday.
Cartwrlght had won the handball tourna
ment held a few weeks ago. and James
succeeded in winning second place. An ex
citing game was expected, and the spec
tators were not disappointed. James. won
the first rubber by a score of 21â 7. James
"killed" at every opportunity and sent a
hot serve to his opponent. In the second
game Cartwright picked up. He sent out
a difficult toss and had 17 points to James'
7 before much time had elapsed. James
then steadied down and played an up-hill
gamo and soon overhauled his opponent.
.When the score was up-sticks the crowd
grew enthusiastic. Cartwrlght made an
other before being put out, and then his
rival went In and by a low Berve won the
match. Score 21â18.

Pqys3 HOUGH the horse may not go,
HI the horseless vehicle is here to
I steam, puff and sputter. At least
It that Is the verdict of all who took
part yesterday In the successful
run of the "automobilious" in the Golden
Gate Park. Before 10 a. m. people began
to gather at the -rendezvous, the corner
of Golden Gate and V&n Ness avenues,
curious to see tha , self-propelled car
riages in line.
The most remarkable vehicles of all
were two motorcycles, that went whirl-
Ing up and down the avenue, looking de
cidedly cumbrous and making a good deal
of noise, but being well controlled by
their riders. It was nearly 11 before a
start was made, and by that time about
fifteen automobiles, chlenv of the steam
propelled variety, were on hand. The
Al Hampton, single-handed, defeated
Russ and Biitz yesterday In the regula
tion court, and then repeated the trick by
defeating Butz and Gleason. Little Hamp
ton played his usually splendid game.
In the second class the contest is also
narrowing down to the finals. To-night
Louis Levy (scratch) will play George
Blrdsall (40): Jerry Johnson (scratch) will
play Melroso (scratch), and McLeod
(scratch) will play Lester Hammersmith
(40):
Bogan (40) won from Bartlett (scratch)
by a score of 40â38. This was the best
game of the afternoon. Bogan played a
brilliant game and outplayed his op
ponent. Bartlett's lack of condition and
the handicap was too much for him. Tqm
Magee was to have played Al Hoffmann,
but failed to materialize. His absence
was a disappointment to the crowd, as an
Interesting game was looked for. There
are now three men left In the first class.
Bogan, Hoffmann and Powers will con
test for honors. v .i
vehicles proceeded In single file along
Golden Gate avenue out to the panhandle,
Â¦where a halt was' made. From the pan
handle some of the chauffeurs returned
to Van Ness avenue, proceeding thence
to Fort Mason, Lombard street, and
along the boulevard to the Presidio, where
they were rejoined, at the parade ground
by their companions who had gone down
McAllister street, up Central avenue and
Into the military reservation. The auto
mobiles then went flown to Fort Point,
up again and along on Presidio Heights.
One vehicle met witn an accident and
was unable to proceed, and some of the
others found It necessary to stop for
Slight adjustments of the machinery.
From the military reservation the chauf
feurs made their w.-iy by various routes
to their starting points.
During the run a ffew horses gazed with
pome alarm at the strange vehicles which
threaten to displace them and showed

Card of Good Coursing the
Result of Finals at
Union Park.
Palo Alto, Olita and Freeze Out Ars
Returned "Winner's in Their Ke
spective Events â Glory for
Rosseter's Kennels.
Yesterday was a gala day at Union
Coursing Park and the enthusiasts that
crowded the ring were given a top notch
card of sport in return for their -patron
age. If the courses had been run to order
it is doubtful that a better exhibition
could have been had than that put up by
the lot of class performers which fur
nished the excitement in the finals of
the three stakes.
The California plate event was won by
Eugene Geary's celebrated head liner
Palo Alto, whose work throughout was of
that standard quality which has forced
him to the front as a courser of high
merit. M. Dunlea's Erin, the runner-up,
reached his place by creditable work.
Luxor and his k'ennel mate Beacon were
put out by Floodgate, whose winnings
hurt, to pome extent, the calculations of
the backers of the Curtis Kennel. Flood
gate got the turn on Luxor in the second
round and followed it out for the kill with
a clean score. Luxor was a 2 to 1 fa
vorite.
Nethercott's dog had the foot over Bea
con, and with the score 4 to 4 dashed In
for the kill and got tne flag, making an
other success on the short end at odds of
3 to 1.
In the reserve stake OHta took first
honors. Moonbright, the runner-up, was
a surprise, and his clever work in reach
ing second place was an expensive story
to form players. Three favorites, Aeneas
at 3 to 1, Hound About at 2 to 1 and Sir
i^wrence at 5 to 3 found him a stumbling
block, and while no credit should be de
tracted from OHta, she would have
changed prizes with Moonbright were it
not lor his wildness in the final.
Freeze. (Jut showed herself a wonder
beyond the most sanguine expectation.
Her hard course of Saturday was her un
doing, it was thought, but she came back
strong and outworked Aeolus after he had
scored the first live points. Aeolus was a
3 to 1 favorite. Then against Merrlwa ehe
went to the game like a seasoned cam
paigner, led him three lengths and was
never In danger. The verdict is that the
sapling is an early comer.
The result of the three stakes must cer
tainly be pleasant to J. H. Hosseter, Palo
Alto and his litter brother Erin, the get
of the great sire Emin Pasha, of Ros
seter's kennels, running one, two in the
plate stake, Olita taking lirst honors in
the reserve event and Freeze Out. the
daughter of For Freedom, Rosseter's
English importation, annexing the fash
ionable Belle Brandon challenge cup stake
is indeed a bunch of honors which fall
seldom to the lot of a leashman ill one
day. '

servations of thi? most Intertstlng object. At
7 p. m. It was fully half a magnitude fainter
than Capella, a decline of a whole magnitude
since noon. Its brightness has continued to
decrease throughout the evening.
â¢ It9 accurate position, as observed by Profes
sor Tucker, Is right ascension 3 hours 24 min
utes 28 seconds and declination 43 degrees 33
minutes and 34 -seconds.
On examining our star charts and catalogues
we find that no star as bright aÂ« the tenth
magnitude has heretoMre occupied^ this posi
tion, so * that this brilliant object occupies a
position that was previously vacant.
The cause of this sudden outburst cannot
now ba stated. It may be due to a collision
between two dark bodies or to Internal dis
turbances In one dark body or to other and
unknown causes. , ,. â¢
Tho star has been observed with the Mills
spectroscope. Its spectrum is peculiar In that
It contains no trace of either bright or dark
lines In the blue and violet. Its light appears
to be strictly continuous, though a few ex
tremely broad bands exist. This is very un-;
usual in the case of a new star.
. Additional observations for various purposes
have been secured with the other Instruments
of the observatory, but their results will not
bo known for many weeks. . â¢
Some twenty new stars have been discovered
and recorded since the Christian Â¦ era. The
present one Is the brightest since thoee found
by Tycho, Brshe and Kepler about the year
1600. There, are perhaps no celestial objects
which are of greater interest to astronomers
than these new stars. Their study Is . very
Important in that they throw light on ques
tions concerning the origin of the stars and
their relations to one another.
This new star can be seen by all in the

Conn., to "try hla act on the dog. He
chose for hla debut a comparatively short
monologue. This he had apparently
learned verbatim, and there was every
indication that he had studied long and
hard to master the most authoritative
pronunciations of some of the unusual
words which were Included In his effort.
It was chiefly stories of himself, from
the time he met Sullivan to Carson City.
To-night Corbett was remarkably free
from nervousness. Indeed, he seemed to
enjoy the situation, and the few guyln<
remarks that were hurled at him from tne
gallery he treated either good naturedly
or with disdain.

TINGUISHES A BLAZE IN THE CLOTHING OF HIS EIGHT-YEAR
OLD SISTER WHILE SHE LAY ASLEEP BEFORE A STOVE.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 24.-The body of a
woman whoso identity is shroud
ed In mystery lies on a slab In tho
Branch Morgue. Not a vestlse of
a clew which might help to di
vulge her name or family was found
among her effects. The woman died yes
terday afternoon at the hospital conduct
ed by Dr. Emile Funcke- Wagner, at 1418
Eighth street, shortly after the birth of
her child.
According to' Dr. Funcke-Wagner"s
.statement the unfortunate woman came
to the hospital on February 15. She gave
the name of Alice McKensy and her ad
dress as East Oakland, though the direc
tory does not contain the name of such a
person. ..'..In the course of her residence
at Dr. Funcke- Wagner's ine woman said
that she had been deceived bv some man
whose name she did not mention. She.
had no visitors.
Dr. C. M. Selfridge was summoned from
Oakland yesterday afternoon to attend the
woman. He did not arrive, however, until
she had been dead an hour. The new-born
child was also dead. Mother and babe
were then removed to the Morgue, the
physician refusing to sign the death cer
tificate until after an investigation.
Nothing of value was found among the
woman's effects. Her belongings cor-slstej
principally of a lot of feminine trinkets,
and Included a powder-box, a rosary .cos
metics, spectacles, chewing gum and a
pamphlet. ' The pamphlet had Drlnted on
the cover "Holy Way of the Cross." and
was issued by the Calvarlan Society of
San Francisco. Between its leaves was
found a card containing the name "Mi<;.
G. G. Laws," written with a pen anJ
without any address. .
The clothing was of the very cheapest.
the best piece belnp n ' .cKet of blue che
viot. There was a sr-ial! cape of black
fur. Another jacket "was fawn color with
a blue lining'. A pair of tan crlovea were
badly worn. The olain. brown felt hit
was encircled with a scarf oi light-blue
silk. ,
The underclothlntr was made r>t cotton
flannel. The stocklngrs were black an-J
there was only the one pair. On cne of
these stockings is the only semblance of
a mark that could be used as a clew. It
is a "D" or "O" stitch-id in red at the top
A minute examination of the clothinjr
failed to show any laundry or other mark*
other than the one oh the stocking. The
dead woman evidently took every precau
tion to hide her identity. While she waj
able to do so nt the hospital she washed
whatever thinss she needed herself. There,
are holes In parts of the clothing: whie*i
indicate that she cut out all marks thnt
may have been put in by the laundries.
It was not because tho woman lacked
money' that she did the washing herself,
as Dr. Funoke-Wafnier sÂ»ays that she pa-d
her right alor? for her board and lodg
lntr and attendance.
The woman was about GO yearn of aere.
She was tall, beinsr five feet four Inches in
height. The features are sham and angu
lar and the skin shows the rssult of th*
too constant use of cosmetlcn. The hatr
is of a rich auburn color and there is a
wealth of it. The hands are daiptv and
slender and grlve no evidence tha.t they
were accustomed to hard work. It In be
lieved that the woman .was a dressmaker.
An autopsy was performed hy Dr. C. L.
Tisdale this evening. He found that death
had resulted from natural causes. Thi*
time for holding the ino/uest has net yet
been set.
Mrs. George G. Laws formerly lived at
72 Pond street, this city, but moved from
that address last January.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 24.â
Preslndent David Starr Jordan was in
terviewed this- evening concerning the re
port of the Eastern economists as to th*
merits of the dismissal of Professor Rom
from Stanford University last November.
He said:
"The statement of Messrs. Sellsrman.
Farnam and Gardner Is not. ta might bÂ«
Inferred from the ne-wspapers, the report
of an authorized committee of the Ameri
can Economic Association. If we are cor
rectly informed, this body declined to ap
point a committee of investigation. ThesÂ«
three gentlemen form a self-constituted
committee, or represent only a minority
of this association.
â¢The facts at their disposal were none
other than tho3e already made public By
Professor Ross and his friends, and the
attitude they hold in regard to these mat
ters is evidently that of partisans. It
may be regretted that they did nst see nt
to publish the letters which they obtained
from the president and the committee at

It will be necessary for you to assume my

sued another decree., which 13. satisfac
tory to the .Ministers, ordering that there
bo posted throughout the empire notices
of suspension of civil service examina

tions now remaining for settlement are
those relating to indemnities and the
withdrawal of the military. Full credit
must be given to Field Marshal Count
von "Waldersee for bringing about the "
present promising condition of affairs.
No matter how distasteful his methods
have been to people who do not approve
of the mailed fist policy it is that policy
that has sent the Chinese Government to
its knees and brought about compliahce
with the demands of the powers as pre
sented through the Ministers.
It is presumed that the suicides ana
executions ordered in the edict of the
Dowager Empress occurred to-day. Hsu

are prisoners in the hands of the Japan

to be long drawn out. Judging from re
cent developments your correspondent is
warranted in stating there is ittle like
lihood of the total demand coming within
$800,000,000 i which Sir Robert Hart, di
rector of . imperial maritime customs,
savs China can pay. Almost without ex
ception It has been the policy of differ
ent foreign i governments to pile up ex
penses. "Spare nothing. China will have
to pay." is one of the commonest expres
sions heard here.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Feb. 24.â Sam
Moy Mayor of Chicago's Chinatown, who
came here recently to iron out difficulties
existing between the local Chinese fac
tions has found the task beyond his di
plomacy and has called in City Attorney
Frank Gordon as arbitrator. Botn fac
tions have agreed to abide by the decision
of Mr. Gordon, and the final hearing is
scheduled for to-morrow. An agreement
has been reached touching certain phases I
of the situation. Dr. Wong Song, against
whom one faction has been warring, Is to
leave Kansas City. That Is agreed upon
by both factions. Fantan games are to
I be taxed and lottery games will pay
; tribute for the support or the 1 Chinese
! Masonic Society. The problem yet to be
! solved involves the method of collection.
Twenty-five cents Is to be collected from i
the winner of each game of fantan. and;
1CP cents is the contribution levied for each
lottery drawing. But the contention
comes in the selection of the person who
is to receive and handlo the money for
the societyâ who Is to be the go-between
between the gamblers and the officers of
the society. This is the question Mr. Gor-.
don Is to solve to-morrow, and its solu
tion promises to be attended by many
difficulties. Heretofore the Chinese have
fought one another through the police
courts, causing endless 'wrangle. The
' police are wining to Â¦ let the Chinese
alone if the Chinese cease to bother them.

SAYS CONGER IS RECALLED.
Peking Correspondent Declares Min
ister Is Not on Leave.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â The Journal has
this from Peking: It i? Wrnad from re
liable sources that Minister Conger has
been recalled and Is not leaving his post
on a three months' furlough, as reported
from Washington and given out here.
Tho Journal's Washington special says:
While It has been officially announced
that Minister Conger Is coming home os
tensibly on a three months' furlough, it
is understood that the leave is no doubt
practically a resignation, growing out of
differences between the Minister and the
Government, and that Mr. Conger will
not return to China. This has not been
confirmed officially.

ed for In life Is pointed out: he enables you to

HOTEL ABRIVALS.
WINDSOR, Feb. 24.â The body of an
unknown man was found hanging to a
tree near the Yates ranch this morning.
Tho Coroner was summoned and an In
quest held, but the Identity of the man
could not be established. He was about
30 years of age, 5 feet 7 inches in height,
dark brown hair and wore a sandy mus
tache. His laundry mark was D-55-M.
and a repair mark on his watch is R 497,
Line 19.
Suicide of Unknown Man.
The child was hardly 3 years old, and it
is regarded as impossible that it could
have wandered very far before the search
was instigated. Some think that the little
fellow has fallen a victim to some lynx, a
large specie of wildcat, which abound on
the point.
This morning Andrew Locatl - of this
city, with a friend and his little son, drove
out to the Follls ranch, which is rented
by Andrew Mllano. After lunch the 7
year-old Mllano girl, accompanied by lit
tle Peter, went up on the hill back of the
house. According to the girl's story, when
Bhe started for home Peter refused to ac
company her, and started up the hill. She
ran to the hou3e and gave the alarm. In
less than ten minutes the father and a
half-dozen friends were on the spot where
the child vas last seen. X)re whole coun
try was searched, but n^a trace of lhÂ«
child rewarded the efforts of the search
ers. All the creeks in the vicinity have
been dragped .ind the ravines and gullies
have been explored, but with no results.

They Escape Before the Arrival of the
Police arid Cannot Be After
ward Identified.
Several drunken rowdies disturbed . an
open air meeting of the Salvation Army
yesterday afternoon and made good their
escape before the arrival of the police.
The Salvation Army people were holding
their usual Sabbath services on Seventh
street, below Market, when the hoodlums
appeared on the scene. The latter com
menced hooting and yelling at the speak
ers. No attention was paid to them ' at
first. They then started In to jostle tha
listeners and one of the army members
politely requested them to refrain. He
was rewarded for his . efforts by a blow
from one of the rowdies that felled him
to the ground. The spectators were about
to interfere when one of the disturbers,
who was standing near the corner, called
out that a policeman was in sight. The
hoodlums did not wait for a second warn
ing. They broke through the crowd and
ran down, Seventh street to seek refuge
In a. saloon. .
When Policeman Tillman. who was on
duty on Market street/ and whose ap
proach caused the hoodlums to run away,
arrived the disturbers ; had . all disap
peared. Unfortunately none ' of the peo
ple present were able to identify the
rowdies, so no arrests were made.
HOODIiTJMS DISTURB
SALVATIONIST MEETING
Park Policeman Manuel de la Guerra
stopped a thrilling runaway In Golden
Gate Park yesterday. At about 4 o'clock
in the afternoon, when the roadways and
footpaths were crowded with vehicles and
pedestrians, a spirited horse attached to a
light rubber-tired rig dashed up the main
driveway in the direction of the panhandle
road. Policeman de la Guerra saw the
runaway and, waiting until the animal
was almost abreas: of him, put spurs to
his horse and dashed in pursuit. The
horse had run a distance of about eitrht
to ten blocks when the plucky officer
seized him by the bridle and stopped hlrn
on the panhandle road, midway between
Baker and Lyon stref ts.
The occupants of the vehicle were J
Keene, 1614 Webster street, and a lady
They were very badly frightened but es
caped injury.
About an hour previously Park Police
man S. M. Thomson stopped a runaway on
the boulevard near the Seal Rock House
The animal, which was owned and driven
by A. I* Reed, 303 California street ran
into the park, where Officer Thomson
caught the reins and brought the rie to a
standstill.
The warm sunshine and the clear blue
sky and Invigorating atmosphere filled the
benches in front of the park music stand
yesterday, but the ground underneath was
muddy and- wet from the' recent rains
Nevertheless the crowds sat and listened
to the music until the last number on tho
programme was Â¦ ll.nlshed. It has been
some weeks since me Park has seen so
many equipages, while the footpaths were
crowded throughout the afternoon .
At the Chutes the crowti was not so
large as it has generally been on- Sunday
afternoons for. the reason that the ma
jority of the day's pleasure seekers were
bound for the scene of the Rio de Janeiro
disaster. \The principal attractions in the
theater were the Hawaiian quartet the
Kobers. trapeze performers, and 'little
Irene Kober, the clever contortionist In
the zoo Wallace, the lion, was seen for
the first time in a great new cage. The
zoo family was also increased last week
by the arrival of a diminutive fawn of
the South American variety, standins
but eighteen Inches. in height.
PARK POLICEMEN" STOP
TWO EXCITING RUNAWAYS
PREPARE TO FILE
BISSINGER WILLS
Rumors of Contests Denied
by Parties Who Are Most
Interested,
During the coming week the wills of
Adolph Bissinger and his wife, who were
killed about a week ago in a railroad ac
cident near Mil! Citv. Xev . will bo file!
for probate. Attorney Gerstle, connected
with the firm of Chlckerlng & Gregory,
has the matter in charce.
Considerable care has been exercised in
securing Information as to which of the
two died first, Bissinger or his wife. II
is usually assumed that the female, beln;;
the weaker person, is the first to succumb
to injuries in such cases
Bisslnger was twice married. His first
wife was a Greenbaum. and his second aa
Oppenheimer. Bv the former he had three
children, and by the latter one. Elsie ia
the oldest daughter. She was with her
father and stepmother at the time of the
accident. It is claimed that to her is
willed the bulk of the fortune, which, it
Is estimated, will nearly reach six figures.
Newton Bissinger of Portland, Or., Is an
Interesting figure in the matter. He is a
son of a half or steobrother of the de
ceased. Rumor has it that Adolph Bia
pinger disinherited him, or rather cut him
off from any portion of his devised estate.
Then Bissinger took, it is said, a pen
dipped in red ink and drew a line througn
this clause. He du'.y Initialed it, so as to
emphasize his change of mind.
Attorney Naphtalycf Naphtaly.Frelden
rlch & Ackerman, who are said to be the
legal advisers of some of the heirs, denies
that there is any probability of a contest
In the matter. Mr. Gcrstle does not looK
for any legal complications In the settle
ment of the estate.

The lake is now about 300 to 400 feet
long and 150 to 200 feet wide. In some
f laces it is ,more than twenty feet deep,

club has been agitating the drainage
question several small children have died
of fever and diphtheria. * Mr. Rutherford,
who ia bereft of his child by yesterday's
tragedy, Is a member of the firm of
Thumler & Rutherford, at 538 California
street.
Soon after tho dinner hour the father
and mother started In search of the miss
ing child. Failing to rind her they went
downtown to notify the police other dis
appearance. While thev were away A. A.
Somerville and F. C. Reynolds, neighbors,
dragged the waters and recovered th-3
body. When the parents returned home
at 10 o'clock they were crief-strlcken to
find the tiny corpse in the house.
Three years ago the Sunset Improve
ment Club, composed of sixty or more in
fluential citizens of the Sunset district
made a determined effort to have the
water drained from the stagnant pool
which had for months been filling up with
the surface water from the Almshouse on
the hill above and from a broken sewer
on Tenth avenue. Provisions were made
by Mayor Phelan that the matter should
be attended to only to adroitly sidetrack
the main issue with suggestions for a free
library in the park. A month ago Engi
neer Grunsky, Chairman Curtis and two
other members of the street committee
of the Board of Supervisors visited the
neighborhood and promised that the
water should be drained away, though
pleading: scarcity of city funds. Mean
while the lake has increased in size and
depth, breeding further disease and un
sanitary conditions in the neighborhood.
At the dinner hour last night Mr. and
Mrs. Rutherford sent the little one cut to
call her 14-year-old Dro'her, Chesley, who
was playing on the opposite bank. Th*
brother responded and started for tha
house, but did not notice that the little
one had, in the meantime, fallen into the
water. ,
Because of tho almost criminal negli
gence of the Mayor and the Board of Su
pervisors little Dorothy Rutherford, a wee
tot of six years, met an untimely death
late yesterday afternoon. Tha little one
toppled over a nteep embankment into a
stagnant lake, bounded by H and J streets
and Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues,
and was drowned. Three hours later tha
body was dragged from the waters and
carried to the home of tho parents, Mr.
and Mrs. James A. Rutherford. 1254

Officer George Gruenwald. detailed Sat
urday night to the scene, was stoned from
the top of the hill. He fired two shots
from his revolver at his assailants scat
tering them quickly.
For some time past the heavy rains have
loosened the rocks that wall one side t*t
Battery street, rendering traffic on the
thoroughfare dangerous. On several oc
casions lareo bowlders have fallen from
their places, narrowly missing pedestrian.-*
and cars. When a section of the danger
ous bluff was ordered removed the resi
dents on the top of the hill believed that
such action would render the foundations

urday afternoon the boys went to a dairv
at 72S Greenwich street and forced open
two doors. There was only a boy In the
place, and he got frightened and ran out.
Werner and Hippel overtook him and
robbed him of 3'i cents. The detectives
are under the Impression that they are
gui.ty of other offenses. They were both
found at their homes Saturday night by
the detectives. Werner's parents live at
2112 Mason street, and Binnel/s at 809Â«4
Montgomery avenue. Werner has an elder
brother now doing time for burglary.
The two boys had not been arrested be
fore, and they do not in the least appre
ciate the fact that they have done anv
thing wrong. They thought it was all
fun They &j that Willie Johnson, a
boy IS years of age. who lives near Sec

to defeat this proposed ordinance to attend that meeting

of Ingleside. I call upon every lover of morality and good
government to sign it."
"I call upon the District Attorney or some other friend
of morality to stop our city officers from violating our
city laws by injunction.
"Why hns a Supervisor any more right to violate a
city ordinance than a more humble citizen?
"We have a law on our city statute books that for
bids poolselling and bookmaking. The people at the last
election by a large majority voted not to allow poolsell
ing and bookmaking In this city. Now the Mayor and
members of the Board of Supervisors, elected by the peo
ple, are said 'to favor the reopening of Ingleside race
track in this city? when they know that it cannot and will
not run without poolselling and bookmaking, though it
be limited to the track.
asking that the ordinance be not passed. In part I>r.
Bane said:
A LARGE congregation listened to a forceful
sermon last night by Rev. A. C. Bane at the
California-street MethodistEpiscopal Church
directed against the proposed revival of
horse-racing at Ingleside and the slave traf
fic existing in Chinatown. Thirteen Chinese
girls in charge of ladies from the Presby
terian Mission occupied seats on the platform behind the
pulpit and sang several hymns during the services.
Miss Cameron of the Chinese Mission was expected to
make an address on the slave trade, but she was sum
moned Saturday to Fresno to rescue a slave girl. Mrs.
L. A. Kelly, one of the most earnest Christian workers
in Chinatown, gave an interesting account of her work
there and the difficulties the missionaries and ladies en
counter In their efforts to stop the miserable conditions
obtaining among the Asiatics.
Rev. Dr. Bane declared the city officials could control
the situation if they cared to, and exhorted every one of
his hearers to sign a petition after the services protesting
against the reopening of Ingleside. Nearly every member
of the congregation signed the appeal to the Supervisors
THE TTVO SMALL, BOYS WHO COMMIT BURGLARY AND ROBBERY
AND ATTEMPT ARSON AND LAUGH WHEN IMPRISONED AS IF IT
WERE ALL VERY FUNNY.
"That the voters of San Francisco by a large majority decided against permitting the selling of
pools and gambling in the city and county.
"That said action of the people is binding upon the Board of Supervisors until the subject is
again submitted to the popular vote.
"That the proposed ordinance is in effect a violation of the charter, in that it will be, if adopt
ed, contrary to the will of the people, expressed under charter provisions.
"That if the mandate of the citizens expressed through methods established by charter is to be
disobeyed by officials elected under the charter, then one of the valued and important popular functions
of the charter will be destroyed." ;
"JOSEPH BRITTON. P. H. McCARTHY. JEROME R. ANDERSON.
"HENHY N. CLEMENT. ALFRED CRIDGE. 'Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ EDWAltD R. TAYLOR.
"A. COMPTE JR. . A. W. THOMPSON. JAMES BUTLER."
The following petition signed by the Freeholders â the citizens who framed the charter under
-which the municipal government is now run, is probably the strongest testimonial against the evil that
could be obtained:
"To the Honorable the Mayor and Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Fran
cisco, State of California: ,'
"Gentlemen: Your petitioners respectfully ask your honorable body not to pass the proposed ordi
nance designed for the reopening of Ingleside racetrack and for the re-e stablishment of legalized gamb
ling in San Francisco, and in this behalf your petitioners submit: .. .
"That the establishment of a gambling resort in this city and county will be of incalculable in
jury to the morals of this community.
"That the subject of gambling and poolselling was submitted to the people of this city and county
at the last elsction, under the provisions of the charter governing the submission of questions to voters.
Wben^this immense petition is filed to-day by the Law and Order League, it will not be merely
received and placed on file. A committee from that organization will be present to appeal, if necessary,
to the Supervisors not to violate their pledges by voting to throw the city wide open to the gamblers.
Ministers who are not members of this organization will also be in attendance to show by their presence
that they are oppossd to the reopening of the track.
The Law and Order League is an organization composed- of the leading ministers and citizens of
this city. The efforts of the members have been put forth in a battlo for morality. They are striving
to have slavery in Chinatown abolished, and have also taken concerted action against that terrible evil
â racetrack gambling. When the gambling element tried to sway the minds of the Supervisors by fil
ing a petition alleged to have been signed by three thousand people, who favored the reopening of In
gleside track, the Law and Order League decided to offset the influence such a petition might have with
the board by circulating a petition to prevent race-track gambling.
That the better element of San Francisco is opposed to the reopening 1 of the Ingleside racetrack
was evidenced yesterday, when, in nearly every church the members of the congregations affixed their
namss to the petitions circulated by the Law and Order Leag^ue. These petitions, signed by many
thousand citizens, will bs filed with the Board of Supervisors to-day. It is believed the members of the
board will carefully consider the important question before voting to license gambling within the city
and county.
