or time of nearest, approach, to the, sun,
occurred December; 1, at a distance only
2 per cent emalier than the ; earth's dis
tance from the sun. The plane of Its orbit
makes an angle of - 31 degrees v with \ the

EL PASO, Tex., Dec. 21.â The recent
discovery of .several large diamonds in
the foothills near Capltan. Otero County,
New Mexico, has created Intense excite
ment in this city among mining men, and
prospectors are flecking to that locality.
The first discovery of four diamonds was
made hy the merest accident. J. J. Blow,
general manager of the LInderman Coal
Company, noticed the stones in an anthill
on the. surface of the ground, where they
had been deposited by. the large red in
sects. He was convinced that the gems
were diamonds, and took them to a local
Jeweler for examination. The Jeweler de
clared that the stones were of the first
water and were.very Valuable, rivaling in
beauty those from the South African
fields.
' Blow Investigated further at the spot
where he found the jewels, and at-a depth
of twelve feet uncovered a bed of pre
cious stones, collecting twenty frorii the
sand. The nevre of the discovery, created
the greatest excitement in the small vil
lage of Capitan, causing many miners to
quit their positions, to prospect for dia
monds, and when the report reached El
Paso it immediately .started" a rush 'of,
prospectors to the. Capitan district. The
diamonds have been forwarded to New,

Town; and. In spite . of optimism
"of the London press, the Govern
ment announcement at Capa Town shows
how seriously the invaslcn is regarded

the British public is the loss of a big

draws attention to what might prove a
serious danger, namely, the possibility of
another outbreak of enteric fever among
the soldiers worn down by the hardships
and privations of aprolonged and excit

It Is now ascertained that the Boers
who trekked westward from Vryburg and

TRAPPED BY BOGUS TELEGRAM.
Boer Strategy Caused the Undoing of
General Colville.
LONDON. Dec. a.â Since his arrival in
London, Major General Sir Henry Col
ville has received information tending to
show that Lieutenant Colonel Spragge
actually received a forged telegram, pur
porting- to be signed by General Colville,
dated LIndley, May 23, saying:
"I am badly In want of mounted troops.
Come here at once."
The above telegram was sent off three
days before General Colville reached
Lindley and was the cause of Lieutenant
Colonel Spragge hastening there.
One of the principal charges against
General Colville Is that, after appealing
to the Yeomanry for help, he abandoned
them to their fate.
"I never heard of this telegram." saya
General Colville, "until now. But it ex

gered by the rise of the Avon, which is
now ten feet above the normal state.
Immense tracts of land In several coun
ties have been transformed into Inland
seas, the Inhabitants seeking refuge In
the upper rooms of their dwellings. Many
.villages are altogether Isolated, and some
fbwns of considerable " size are without
gas, owing to the works being flooded.
More Failures Follow.
The fears of further failures in connec
tion with the collapse of the London and
Globe Finance Corpdration (Limited) were
but partly realized to-day, and the whole
tone of the Stock Exchange steadied In
consequence. The failures of Thomas W.
Egan. G. W. Barber and Fitzgerald &
Co., Jobbers in the West Australian mar
ket, were announced, but they had little
effect. Americans were marked up from
one-half to four points, and the rapidity
with which all the offerings were taken
up for JCew Tork had a good effect In
steadying other departments. There was
even a better feeling In West Australians.
Lake Views f hewed a recovery, but Lon
don and Globo waa offered and further
declined 2 shillings 6 pence. British Co
lumbia* were steady. Lerol No. 2 was one
point higher.
The London and Globe Finance Corpora
tion sent a circular to its shareholders to
day calling for a meeting for January 9
for the purpose of passing a resolution
to wind up the company. The circular
pays the capital of the company Is locked
up in securities on which at present It Is
Impossible to realize, and the corporation
therefore, by reason of its liabilities. Is
unable to carry on Its business.
Major Cuignet Tried.
A special from Paris saya a military
hoard of Inquiry, presided over by Gen
eral Noellat, commanding the sixth divi
sion of the Third Army Corps, began at
Fort Montvalrlen to-day an investigation
into the charges against Major Cuignet.
The indictment charges him with writing
directly to the Premier, M. Waldeck-
RouBseau. and to the Minister of War,
General Andre, Instead of through his im
mediate superior officer, and with pub-
Uphljig these letters and with refusing to
reply to General Andre's Interrogatory.
ThÂ« witnesses included the following
Ministers of War: De Gallifet, Zurlinden,
Cavaigmac and Kranz. and Generals Ro
fet. De Boisdeffre and Gonse and Deputy
>aFcp.. . Â¦ .
The Inquiry was concluded this after
noon, but the decision- of the board was
not divulged. It Is understood, however,
that a decision was arrived at on the
question as to whether Major Cuignet's
offense justified his being dismissed from
the army. ,

A Weimar special says: ThÂ© condition
of the Grand Duke of Saxe- Weimar, who
is suffering from influenza complicated
with inflammation of the lungs, is very
serious. The action of his heart is weak

worst Is feared. Â¦
The Czar Has Recovered.
Â¦ A St. Petersburg special says: The Czar
has completely recovered his . health and
Is able to- take long walks and drives
daily. Â¦ One of his Majesty's physicians
has conveyed to the Dowager Czarina fa
vorable reports of the Czar's health.

OMAHA. Dec. 31.-At a specially
called meeting of the City Council
that body this afternoon adopted
a concurrent resolution offering: a
reward of $25,000 for the arrest
and conviction of the persons who abduct
ed Kdward Cudahy Jr. on the night of
December IS. For the arrest and convic
tion of one the resolution provides a re
ward of $5000; for two $15,000 will be paid,
and the whole amount is offered for the
three principals
The members of the Council did not de
liberate long and the vote by which the
resolution was passed was unanimous.
The Council also asked Mr. Cudahy to
withdraw his offer of a reward of an
equal amount for the capture of the crim
inals. The object of the city's offer is
largely to relieve Mr. Cudahy and his
family of the fear 'of reprisals from the
bandits and to remove from the police

RODNEY TELLS
HIS TROUBLES
A GREAT BUSINESS YEAR.
The New York Life Insurance Com-
pany's Wonderful Showing.
NEW YORK', Dpc. 31. â The closing- day
of the year indicates great prosperity In
every business direction. The large mer
cantile houses, the various banking In
stitutions and the trades generally are
quite enthusiastic with the records made.
The Fire Insurance business has not
resulted In great profits for stockholders
owing to the poor rates obtained, but the
regular, or old line life insurance com
panies, on the other hand, will make a
splendid showing. The leader In the busi
ness obtained and In force will undoubted
ly be the New York Life, as President
McCall has Issued a statement that the
new applications to his company In 1900
will exceed three hundred and twenty mil
lions of dollars, or more than a million
n day for every working day in the year.
The company's new paid for business In
1900, excluding- risks rejected, etc., is $230,
000,000. The total paid for Insur
ance In force is $1,200,000,000, a gain of
JUO.OOO.OOO over the previous year. It is
believed in financial circles that many
of the foreign governments will be ap
plicants for largw loans in this market
early- in the new year, and the orders
from Europe generally for steel rails, en
gines, agricultural implements and ma
chinery of all kinds, are in excess of all
previous years.
RYLEY'S NEW PLAY ;. â¢ .

ROCHESTER, Dec. , 31.â Wagrenhal &
Kemper Inaugurated their managrement of
Henry Miller at the, Lyceum Theater to
night, presenting Madeleine Lucette Ry
ley's new play, "Richard Savage."
The title role firives Mr. Miller one of
the greatest opportunities of Â¦ his career.
The play scored an emphatic success.
The author, who had come direct from
London to seÂ«Â» the performance, was pres
ent. The play was superbly Btnsrpd ati'l
costumed. The '.company '-includes Mrs.

ATLANTA, Ga, Dec. 31.â A private dW
: patch received , In. Atlanta -to-day, "from
i New York saya that Kdward G. Goffman,
i the alleged : absconding secretary and
treasurer of the South .Agricultural
"Works and ... manager .'of the Atlanta
Handle Company, committed suicide in
New t York last nigi: ( . Those i companies
.were- financed largely by Milwaukee. men
and Â¦ the president of the : company, .Â¦ S.
'Landauer. killed himself In Atlanta about
six months, ago.
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.-An official state
ment of the objects of the new combina
tion of traveling theatrical managers has
just been made. The name of tne organi
zation will be "The Association of Travel
ing Managers." In general the object is
mutual protection. Papers of incorpora
tion were executed and filed at Albany to
day. Nearly 150 traveling attractions are
already represented in the membership.
Offices will be established at once and
general and assistant managers will b<;
appointed.
One of the chief objects of the associa
tion is to secure better terms from rail
road companies. The managers believe
that transportation rates are at present
excessive.
Another Important object Is the estab
lishment of a system of attorneys and
bondsmen throughout the country.
Unreliable actors will be tabooed by the
association. If violation of contracts ami
gross misconduct upon the part of any
actor are proven no member of the as
sociation will be permitted to give him
further employment. In a measure the
general manager will supplant the the
atrical agents, for lists of available per
formers will be kept. Tne members of
the association expect in this manner to
expedite the matter of engaging talent
If this is carried out, it means loss of
business to the agent and saving of com
missions to the actors.
The Century of Wonder.
The Rev. Minor' J. Savage, preaching
lasj night in the Church of the Messiah
on "The Century of Wonder," eaid in
part: .
"There are no classes In this country,
and the aÂ«ltatlon that is going: on as to
the condition of the laborer, instead of be
ing a discouraging sign, is altogether a
hopeful one. It Is said that the rich are
growing richer and the poor poorer. ThU
is simply not true. There are more rlcn
people in this country to-day than ever
before, but there are not more people poor
according to the population. There never
was a time, let me say In a general way,
when wages were so high as they are to
day â when the common people could earn
so much and so easily. -
Dr. Savage referred to the advancement
of woman's position during: the closing
century, and said that as soon as all the
women of this country desired the right
of suffrage they would receive it. He also
spoke of the present reform movement In
this city, hoping for its success but depre
cating the exploiting of.information about
vice.
Order of the Holy Cross.
It is announced that the community o'
celibate priests, known as the Order oZ
the Holy Crosa, formerly resident In this
city, but for a number of years estab
lished In Westminster, Md., will soon re
move from its present home and re-estao
lish Itself within the hmlts of the Epis
copal diocese of New York, although net
within the corporate bounds of the city.
The life of the members of the order ha3
not been' altogether happy In their pres
ent surroundings;: for' Bishop Parot, Â¦ the
Bishop of Maryland, has disapproved of
their ritualistic practices, and. inhibited
them from performing priestly f unctlor.a
within his jurisdiction. * The Rev. Jamea
O. 8. Huntlngon. the father superior, who
Is a son of Bishop Huntingdon, announces
that a plat "of land for the new monastery
has also been purchased at -West Park,
, on the bank of the Hudson River, about
seventy-five miles from New York.

and detectives the restraint they have felt
in trailing the bandits on account of the
very trying position in which Cudahy has
been placed. The action of the Council,
is generally commended by the citizens.
Mayor Mooiv.s, speaking of the matter
to-day said: "Bullets or no bullets, I in
tend to offer a reward for the arrest of
the Cudahy kidnapers. That last letter
from the kidnapers puts such a serious
coloring on the case that it Is not right
to expect Mr. Cudahy to continue his offer
of I25.CKX) for the arrest and the convic
tion of the men who stole his boy."
Notwithstanding the anxiety of Mavor
Moorcs to relieve E. A. Cudahy of the
"burden" of offering a reward of $23,000
for the airest and conviction of the kid
napers and the offering of another reward
of $2o.000 based on the Mayor's "personal
guaranty" to ntise it by popular subscrip
tion. Mr. Cudahy declines to be relieved
of the burden, and announces that his re
ward will stand.

j The Secretary o/ War has communicat
ed to Congress a cablegram from tha
Philippine Commission indicating a grave
i crisis In the monetary affairs of the archi
j pelago. The message was communicated
to Congress in connection with a mass of
I memoranda bearing on the problem which
is now to be solved, as to the coinage of
nomc kind of silver to take the place of
the Mexican dollar In the Philippines. The
commission has cabled that the stock of
silver in the Islands is rapidly diminish
ing, and they urge that they require an
answer to the message sent September 7,
patting out the necessity for prompt ac-Â»
tlon and asking what remedy shall be ap- s
plied. It has been found impossible, ap-'
parently, to continue the ratio of 2 to 1,
established and maintained arbitrarily,
and the Mexican money is being drained
away rapidly toward India, making it dif
! flcult for the disbursing officers to trans
act business.

Emmington was awaiting trial for an
attempt to murder State Prison Guard
Samuel Randolph, whom he shot at Point
San Quentin last month. While confined
In the penitentiary he conceived a hatred
of Randolph, and after his discharge he
returned to the Point and waited for Ran
dolph to come from the prison for his
mall. He attacked Randolph and fired
upon him. inilicting a severe flesh wound.
The desperate man took to the hills and
eluded his pursuers until midnight, when
he was captured by Sheriff Taylor on the
ridge back of this city.
Emmlngton's escape to-day was due to
a violation of Sheriff Taylors Injunctions
to his deputies never to allow the man
out of the steel tank without a guard be
ing present to -watch him. This afternoon
E B.-Martlnelll called to see Emmington.
and Deputy Sheriff Lucas let him out of
the tank. When Martlnelli departed the
prisoner asked for and was allowed to
take a bath. When Lucas returned at
supper time Emmington hid behind the
door and escaped. Sheriff Taylor went
to San Francisco In the afternoon and did
not: learn of the escape until his return,
about one hour afterward.
Several posses are searching: for the Â«
convict. It Is reported that he was seen
going toward Point San Pedro. His cap
ture Is almost certain, as his face has a
large scar, which will easily lead to his
detection. Â¦ _ -

Over 300 head of pure bred -and high
grade cattle have been entered for the
exhibition. This stock is from Missouri,
Illinois, Kansas, Colorado, Iowa, Nebras
ka and Utah. Most of it will be offered
for sale at the close of the show and it
will therefore attract considerable atten
tion from the breeders of this and ad-
Joining States.
The mall of the national association as
well as the general committee in this city
Is daily burdened with letters containing
the same information. All of them ask:
"Will the Southern breeders be at your
meeting" If they are coming up, we will
be there to talk business and make con
tracts for this year."
J. M. Boardman, ore of the leading cat
tlemen of Montana. In a recent conver
sation said: "Our State has not over 43
per cent of the cattle on the range that
ft should have. The percentage has been
growing less for two or three years past,
and our grasses are going to waste be
cause of lack of stock to" eat it. We have
held oft buying because we thought South
ern prices too high, but as present Indi
cations are that they will be maintained
for some years to come, I believe the
feeling to stock up again Is becoming gen
eral among- our people. If we cannot
make contracts for steers at Salt Lake In
January we will be compelled to go to
New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma and
Texas and pick them up as we can."
The demand for steers this year will
be greater than heretofore for several rea
son?. The Asiatic orders at the Pacific
Coast markets during the last twelve
months have been so 'great that the terri
tory usually depended upon to supply
them has been completely denuded of all
desirable cattle, and. the railroads to-day
are called upon to carry stork to these
Western markets from Wyoming. Mon
tana, Utah and even Western Colorado
In numbers heretofore unheard of. The
demands made upon the northern and
western terri^rv by the Eastern mar
ket* have beeiT equally as pressing, with
the result, as one Montana man expressed
it. that "there are no cattle in our coun
try."
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah. Dec. 31.â
Heretofore the annual convention of the
National Livestock Association has been
the occasion of a vast amount of trading
between the range men of the North and
the breeders from the Southern States.
Salt Lake City, during the week begin
ning January 14, promises to break all
previous records as a market for young
Southern steers, and it will be no great
surprise if contracts for spring delivery
amounting to $2,500,000 will be signed up
during the seyen days the stockmen are
here.

Special Dispatch to Tfce Call
VANCOUVER, Dec. 3Lâ The Harrison,
Hot Springs mail nage was held up at
1:30 o'clock this aiternoon by three
masked highwaymen. The state was
passing througti a belt of woods five miles
from Affassiz Static n. on the line of the
Canadian Pacific Railway, about sixty
miles from Vancouver, when a tall man
holding' a rifle sten>ed from the bushes
aad seized the horses' bridles. At the
cunt moment two other men presented a
rifle from either side, covering the driver
and the nine passer gerb within the coach.
The latter were rr-ostly travelers from
i Vancouver and coast cities going into
Harrison, a village of 500 people and fa
mous baths. One of the passengers was
a woman.
All held up their nanfis and they were
then requested to climb out and line up
for examination. One of the robbera
searched their p^cketb. obtaining money
and valuables worth $500 or $6C0.
A consignment of Government timber
dues of t'Md was supposed to be on the
coach, but It had in r eallty been shipped
by another route. Five mail pouches
were cut open and their contents exam
ined. A Dominion express package, which
contained several thousands' worth of pa
per but little actual ca*h, was taken. The
robbers then allowed the men to resume
their places and ordered the driver to
hurry forward.
The woman, who evidently was poor,
had only 65 cents, and the tallest robber
cave the money back to her, saying that
he could not take so small an amount for
New Year's. Ke took a $5 piece that he
had just extracted from another man's
pocket and handed It to her.
This Is the second time in a year and a
iialf that this stagro has been held up in
the same spot. On the last occasion a
comparatively small haul was made by
a lone highwayman. The provincial po
lice are making every effort to locate the
robbers.

"I have used â¢ Swamp-Root for years
â¢whenever I was troubled with my kld-
neys, with constipation, or whenever I
felt the need of something to tone and
trace me up. This has given me such re-
lief that I do not find it necessary to take
medicine regularly now, as an occasional
dose of Swamp-Root keeps me In shape
for my workâ that of head cutter In the
Clothing Company of Rath & Jean. I am
pleased to give a testimonial for your
splendid medicine, and I cannot say
enough for what it has done for me. I
gratefully recommend It to any one need-
Ing a thoroughly reliable remedy." Yours

YOD SHOULD NOT
NEGLECT YOUR KIDNEYS
Because at All Times They Have the Most
Important Work to Do.
Weak Kidneys Caused by Overwork, by Lifting or a Strain.
To Prove what Swamp-Root, the Great Kidney Remedy, Will Do
for YOU, Every Reader of "The Call" May Have a Sample
Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for much sickness
and suffering, therefore, when through neglect or other causes,
kidney trouble is permitted to continue* fatal results are sure
to follow.
It used to be considered that only urinary and bladder troubles
were to be traced to the kidneys* but now modern science proves
that nearly all diseases have their beginning in the disorder of
these most important organs.
Your other organs may need attention â but your kidneys most,
because they do most and need attention first.
If you arc sick or "feel badly," begin taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root* the great kidney* liver and bladder remedy* because
as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all the other organs
to health. A trial will convince any one.

from pirate raids In Klaochau, Manchu

was the presentation by club members of
a parody on "The Only Way." which was
entitled '"rtie Other Way." The members
Â«nd their guests assembled in the ball- j
loom, one end of which was fitted up as
a stage. The musical burlesque was cred
itably presented nnd did great credit to
all who took part in It. If the club
should ever decide to send tho "com
pany" on the road It would be sure to at
tract crowded houses. For two hours the
tuirllence laughed heartily at the Jokes,
songs, dances and situations, and "The
Other Way" was voted by all a complete
success.
Those who took part In It were: Milton

man, D. Elsenbaeh, J- Triest. The bur
leFque was written and staged by local
professionals nnd the handling of the
r 'mob scene" was as realistic as th<Â» one
shown by Henry Miller.
After the presentation of the burlesque
the members and their friends sat down
to an elaborate banquet In the supper
room. As the, clock struck the hour of
midnight, telling of the end of the nine
teenth century and the birth of the twen
tieth century, all the guests rose to their
feet and In bumpers of wine drank to the
new era. A beautiful Illusion was dis
closed to view on a small staare set In a
corner of the supper-room. Master Nor
man Phillips, drrssed as Father Time,
was seen on a bicycle riding toward a
r-cst marked 1900. As the clock sounded
the last stroke of midnight the scene was
changer! to a country road, on which , a
young girl In an automobile was starting
out for thejtwentieth century post.
A ball followed the supper. Professor
Rosner of the Orpheum supplied the
dance music, that for the burlesque being
furnished by. Professor Leo Brook.
The ladles who are prominently identi

WATCH MEETING
ebrating in their own peculiar, original
way the departure of one century and the
admit of another. When darkness came
people hastened from all parts 'of the city
to Market street. Armed with horns,
lattles, trumpets, noise-provoking Instru
ments in all their variety, men, women
and children left their homes and flocked
to the main thoroughfares of the city.
On Market Btreet, in one great, swaying,
noisy, gooJ- humored mass of hu
manity, they met. Some were in mas
queradp. in grotesque, odd costumes. In
the fantastic livery which told that for
one night Â«t leaÂ«t they intended to forget
the Eeriou.T.esy of life and treat it as a
farce.
Boys, bubbling with fun. marched the
street?, yelling, shouting, cheering, beat
ing improvised tomtoms, blowing horns,
swinging ratties, exploding bombs and
wishing to every one in their path a hap
py New Year. Girls, flushed with excite
ment, exhilarated by the myriad, happy.
Jolly faces that greeted them, elb.owed
their way along the streets, pre-empted
the wagon waye. gave noisy greeting to
friend and Ptrangerand accepted in laujÂ»h
i:iK good nature the ear-splitting replies
to their caiutations.
fitald men of affairs passed -along the
streets blowing horns with all the se
riousness of an affair of state. Gray
haired women played the pranks of their
grandchildren and laughingly received the
showers of flour which followed their
greetings, noisy, startling and indiscrim
inate. San Francisco had forgotten its
classes and castes, and in one homoge
neous whole was taking a night off.
And at midnightâ at the moment when
one century and its thoughts passed into
history, and another with its hopes was
bornâ pandemonium reigned. From the
ships in the harbor, from the factories
and the Bhops, came the deep-toned blasts
of whistles. Bells were clanging and' there
waÂ« the roar and rumble and bewildering
confusion of countless sounds. With one
impulse the crowds in the streets stopped,
greetings and good-wishes were exchanged
and for a moment at least there were no
distinctions of class or position In San
Frarocisco.
While thousands of merry-makers, mas
queraders, boys, girls, men and women,
thronged the streets other thousands
crowded the sanctuaries and meeting
houses of the city. In churches devotees
saw the old century go and the new one
come. With prayer, invocation and sa
cred music the night was passed. Socie
ties, clubs and associations kept the
watch of the night and in re r velry and
good fellowship and good cheer celebrated
a night exceptional in Its Bentlment. Per
haps in the history of San Francisco no
other celebration possessed bo much of
unique Interest as did this, in which tht,
people of the city gave. good speed to a
departing century and welcome to the
coming.

a watch meeting In the Shiels building
last night at which there were a large
number of young people who sought ref
uge from the nolae of horns on the street.
There was an impromptu programme of
music, song and dancing. A great deal
of merriment was created by the young
men asking ladies aa they entered the hall
to walk up to the secretary's desk to reg
ister and then making them pass under a
bough of mistletoe and demanding the
penalty. The affair was managed by Miss
Ella Crawford, Miss Laura Cantus, Miss
Minnie Sproul, C. T. Qulrey. C. Johnson
and H. Mqnig of California Council, and
Mrs. \Y. E. L# Dieu, Miss E. Moore and
Miss G. Diemer of Martha Washington
Council. At midnight there was a wishing
of happy New Year and the blowing of
horns that equaled the noise of the street.
Ix>yal Rebekah Lodge also had a watch
meeting In Odd Fellows* Hall. At first
it was decided to have a quiet meeting,
but the young people did not think a
Quaker meeting was in keeping with the
enthusiasm of the close of the year, so
they started a dance and kept It up till
midnight.

Pocahontas, Improved Order of Red Men,
.also joined In the festivities by having a
lancing party to celebrate the departure
/if the old and to welcome the new year.
The hall was crowded to Us utmost and

VALLEJO, Dec. 31.â Perry Fitts, who is
alleged to have blown open^the pafe of a
lumber company in Santa Rosa on Christ
mas night, was captured at Benicia'yes
terday by Constable Hyde at the direction
of Chief of Police Stanford of Vallejo.
Chief Stanford received a telephone mes
sage from Santa Rosa Saturday night
stating that one of the men implicated in
the safe-cracking had left. Santa Rosa for
this section. Stanford instituted a search
and ascertained that the fellow had been
seen In the vicirjity of South Vallejo on
Saturday morning with two companions.
Presuming the trio had gone to Benicia
Stanford telephoned a description of Fitts
to Constable Hyfle of that place and later
received word that the three men were
held by that officer. ; ,
Chief Stanford drove to Benlola: yester
day and found that one of the men. was
Fitts. This morning Constable Plerman
of Santa Rosa accompanied Chief Stan
ford to Benicia, where they took Fitts in
charge and: brought him to Vallejo:
FIttsis a small, smooth-faced man. He
does not seem much concerned about his
capture and took things In a matter-of
fact* sort of way. In company with Con
stable Plerman he left Â¦ for . Santa Â¦â¢ Rosa
this a/tcrnoon. One of his alleged con
federates, a man named iMooney,' Is al
ready held In custody, there. ..
The sum which the. cracked safe con
tained was something like. $6,' the lumber
company using it only for the safe stor
age of books. Aside from a small. amount
of change no money was ever left in the
safe.
Constable Hyde of Benicia
Take3 Perry Fitts Into
Custody.
SUPPOSED SAFE
BOBBER CAUGHT
WICHITA, Kans., Dec. 31.â The County
Jail was quarantined, for smallpox to-day.
The prohibitionists allege that the quar
antine was put on by pressure of saloon
interests as an extra punishment to Mrs.
Nation, the saloon smasher, who is con
fined there.
Mrs. Nation, in the course of an appeal
to women everywhere to aid in the cru
sade against saloons, says:
"I can stay in Jail and eat my bread
and gravy in a tin pan and with a spoon.
I can stay here and be quarantined from
seeing any friends. 'I. can sleep on a' bed
without a pillow and take the fare of the
poor criminals and feel this a small sacrU
flee. Can you not do something? Â«.
"Take your consecrated rocks, , hatchets,
brickbats and . everything that comes
handy and you can clean this curse out.
Don't wait for the ballot. . * .

THE blor.ae-r.airal plunger, cnaney
Ellison, said au revoir to the old
year at Oakland track yesterday
With a tinge of regTet in it all.
He plucked an ice cool S3Q90 from
the ring over the spread-eagle win of the
third event by his: good two-year-old Bard
cf Avon, and when Specific snickered In
first for the mile | and a furlong run
cleaned vp a IJke amount. That is money
enough to make one like any climate or
year, so with hiS podtets bulging out with
twenties Charley said he would see what
sort of metal the new century was com
posed of to-day.< The win of Specific made
it unpleasant, though, for Sam Hildreth,
who does not seem to be playing- in the
best of luck. Hildreth's Bangor. with
Bultoan and 111 pounds up. closed a 6 to 5
favorite. -In .the East the blinkered horse
was ccnsldered an Inconsistent perform
er and in yesterday's race gave a pleas-
Ing but expensive exhibition of temper.
Â¦While running In fourth position on the
back stretch Bu-llman said his mount was
bumped by Topmast, after which Bangor
fell completely out of the race, being
eased up at the finish. In front from
flagfall. Specific, ridden by Mounce, won
galloping from Campus and Topmast. At
the conclusion of the afternoon's sport
the fudges announced that the Hildreth
F.tabfe stood tuspended. pending a further
investigation of the race.
A large crowd attended the reopening
of the track over the bay. The favorites
did rot behave nicely at all. Gibraltar
at 9 to 10 and Rollick, a very meek choice,
to be pure did manage to win. but the
downfall of four cither well-backed ones
was a hard blow to the talent.
Just because she belonged to Burns
& Wattrhouse. ' perhaps. everbody
warted a ticket on Dolly Weithoff to take
tee first event, a six furlong selling dash.
I>olly. with O Connor in the saddle, al
ways occupied a prominent position
among the leaders, still could not deliver
the merchandise. Clem Jenkins dropped
along toward the last with Vohlcer, a 6 to
1 shot, rocking the favorite to sleep quite
handily. Matt Ilogan, a 15 to 1 shot,. ran
a close third.
The ten starters Jn the scramble over
the Futurity course for two-year-olds fur
nished a tiptop guessing affair. Dandy
Jim. . after his win at Tanforao, looked
best, but had an inferior rider up. and
was almost lost sight of in the ring as
well as in the race. Dominick and 100
pounds on Rollick looked tempting, the
odds falling down from 6 to 4. As usual
Dominick was first away, and cutting out
a fast clip was never headed, beating
Grafter a couple of lengths. Not far back
Flatterer, with J. Daly up, finished third.
It is definitely settled that Bard of Avon
can climb over a route. Those who back
ed Silurian and Havlland in the seven
furlong run, third to be decided, will bet
on it now. With H pounds and .J. Daly
pitched up on his back the Bard Just tin
canned along in advance of his company
from start to finish. Dominick rode Hav
lland hard to down the 100 to 1 chance.
Imp Broadbrim, piloted by Eddie Jones.
J. Walsh on Pat Dunne's Silurian, the
mild 2 to 1 choice, got away from the post
badly, never being a factor.
Hildreth's Gibraltar looked to outclass
the other starters in the fourth number
ar.d was sent Into Mr. Caidwell's bands,
a 9 to 10 favorite. Bullman beat the
bunch away from the barrier, but took him
back allowing Amasa to make the pace.
It carne very near being a dangerous ex
periment, for Gibraltar c had to be hard
ridden the last furlong to beat Socialist,
a 20 to 1 outsider, ridden" by Eddie Jones.
Tiburon and Alice Dougherty were both
disappointments.
Dominick scored his second 1 win of thÂ«>
day with Wyoming irr the final mile sell-
Ing run. Six and 7 to 1 could be had about
the I'-rown entry, which made an end to
end thing of it. The winner was allowed
to Ftoal too much of a lead, for when
BuJlman on Horton c and Mounce astride
lh* first choice. Flush of Gold, made their
moves it was too late. The favorite lost
the place to Horton by less than a length.
Great Programme To-Day.
The feature of the great card this after-

For some time past there has been much opposition
in New York to the project for a deep waterway
from the lakes to the ocean on account of the loss
of business the construction of such a canal might
entail. The operation of the new vessels will show
whether the fears of New Yorkers in thai respect
are well founded. As four of them.are to be 1 engaged
in the trade and as each of them -lias a -capacity of
7000 tons, it will be seen they <will be ablcf to very
thoroughly test Chicago's fitness to compete with
New York as an importing city; and the results may
materially hasten the construction of the c proposed
deep-water canal by demonstrating the benefits direct
communication from the lakes'to the sea will.be to
the people of the Mississippi Valley. â¢ '
' The new boats will be freighters only, but will
probably have the effect of cutting down to a con
siderable extent the .trade New York has carried on
in the way of handling Chicago's traffic with'the Old
World. As grain and other freight shipjied by the"
newly launched vessel and others like it will not have
to'break bulk or be transshipped, there will be a large
saving as compared to the presentmode of shipping,
and New York will have to offer counterbalancing
advantages or lose the trade. â¢ â¢ â¢
/"""â¢HICAGO managed to launch before the
( close of the nineteenth century a ship designed
to make the voyage from the lakes across the
ccean to Europe. It is a step toward the accomplish
ment of an object upon which Chicago enterprise
has iong been bent. So eager have they been to
place their city into direct communication with th?
ocean in some way that most Chicagoans would have
felt a good deal of regret had the century closed with
out showing something done in the way of its ac
complishment.

. There are other dark spots. Recent reports to
the War. Department are to the effect that attempts
to supplant Mexican silver- in the islands with Ameri
can money have been futile, that the alien contract
labor law of the United States could not be enforced
there without injuring large agricultural interests,* and
that .various- efforts to establish civil administration
under American supervision have failed.
The .brighter side of the problem isi.presented in a
recent letter from Colonel Parker, who is in com
mand of a province in Southeastern Luzon, with a
population of about 50,000. The letter, written* to "a
friend, was published in the .Outlook." The writer
says: "Things are gradually progressing here. We
have- Mayors and police "in ; all the. towns of the
province, and also schools. I'detail a soldier to teach
EngKsh in each school- and the children are making
great progress. On- account Â°of the confusion' of dia
kctsj BIcol, Visayan, llolan and Tagal,Â°th<; text books
have, always been Spanish. I trust that the commis
sion will not allow this system to be perpetuated." -I
*propose"rhat in the fchools of this district the chil
dren shall learn geography, history an ji arithmetic fn
â¢ English,' as they desire toÂ° do."
The notable -point in the statement is -the an
nouncement that the children jdesire to learn in Eng
lish/ Their: willingness implies an-almost equal will
ingness .on the part of the.parehts, for if the children
were taught at home to hate Americans, or to be op
posed to American ways, they would show the result
of that teaching by sullenness and by antagonism to
everything American introduced into their lessons.
â¢ As an illustration of the. temper "of the people
toward American instruction, Colonel Parker says:
In one of the fcchools I have established here the*
children, uruffht two hours daily by a eoldler,- orally, (for
1 have, ho booics^have , learned In six -weeks; over 500
English words, and^ can even Â¦.sustain, a short conversa
tlon^thelr.accent being clear and distinct. Nowadays, as
I ride about my. province J am saluted nt every. door by
"little childish, voices piping up. "Good morning, colonel."
[l stop and speak wifjj tfcfcn in English. They answer
USMnHnBHMllBfli ' * ' Â¦ ' Â¦'Â¦ " '
The dark side of the situation is fairly well under
stood. Aguinaldo shows no signs of either making'
an unconditional surrender or of accepting any con
ciliatory tactics on our part. His followers, though
weak' in & military sense, are. still so numerous as.
to require us to maintain an army of 60,000 tnen in
the islands to keep the prestige of authority. As for
making a well ordered peace and keeping "it un
disturbed, that appears for the present to be an im
possibility. \
OJsE of the questions which will engage the
attention of all patripts in pondering upon
the problems which confront the country at
the beginning of the new century is that of our
dealings with the Philippines. There is much of
gloom upon the prospects there, but evidence is not
lacking of a coming light that will clear the skies. If
affairs be' not well now, there is, promise at least they
will improve from this time on!
LIGHT IN THE PHILIPPINES.
That, then, is the result of trying to run. an ideal
newspaper according to the notions of men who
know nothing about newspapers or the newspaper
public. Men are not as bad nor are Christians as
weak as Dr. Parker reports them. There is much
of virtue and of intelligence in the world, as all true
newspaper men know. The trouble with Parker is
that he tried to reach that intelligence and appealed to
that virtue in the wrong way. The moral of the les
son is' that if the ideal newspaper is to be developed in
this century it will be developed under the direction
and according to the ideals of newspaper men.
His remarks revealed that he was disappointed by
the failure of his anti-gambling cruFPfle in that paper.
He said he almost feared it was impossible' for a daily
paper to live without gambling. Christians were dead
or it would not be so. A theoretical Christian laid aside
hi;? Bible and hymnbook to follow the betting newsl A
Christian c of this type barred the greatest reformation
the world would ever see, namely In the region of Jour
nalism. Continuing, Mr. Parker said: "The letters I re
ceived from nominal Christians during my editorship dis
gusted me. Christians are becoming invalids, and the
church is a hospital. Nurses are wanted. â¢ Manliness is
dead."
In the absence of Â«ny o production from Dr. Park
hurst, we shall have to set against the paper which.
Harmsworth will present the experience of Rev.
Dr. Parker of the City Temple, London, who for
a week had charge of the London Sun and conducted
it according to his notion. 'Parker was not satisfied
with the result of his efforts and concluded that the
public and not the press is to blame for whatever
may be deserving of blame in the modern newspaper.
A' dispatch giving a report of his allusion to the
subject in his Christmas sermon says: âÂ¦ 0 . .
r~" OMETHING of regret may be felt that Dr.
Parkhurst did not have .an opportunity to
*â ' bring out this morning his ideal newspaper,
so that it might be seen in contrast with that which
Alfred Harmsworth, editor and proprietor of the
London Mail, is to get out for the New York World.
The ideal paper of the zealous moral' reformer and
the ideal paper of the practical editor appearing on
the same day would furnish an interesting and pos
sibly an instructive object lesson for editors.and re
formers alike. Â» *

ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
There ought to be common sense 'enough in the
country to stop the. destruction and begin the process
of rehabilitation. Australia has done this and so has
Texas. Must the United States confess that it has
not their wisdom, and permit the flocks and herds
to disappear with what they feed on, and the price
01 meat to rise until its consumption is limited 'to
the few who can afford it? The Salt Lake Gty con
vention will discuss this subject California should
Ve repfesented there. We believe the Governor has
the appointment of delegates and the State Agricul
tural Society is entitled to representation, as are the
\arious livestock organizations and the railroads. The
State has a vital interest in the subject. # Not only ou'
domestic meat supply is in peril, but a possible ex
port trade of great proportions. The stock ranger,
Jhe consumer and the transportation companies have
a common interest in the matter and should work
together. Who will see that the State is represented?
* r 'HE annual meeting of the National Livestock
I Association occurs at Salt Lake City on= the
* 14th inst. This is the most* important gather
ing of stockmen in the history of that industry. It
may make /or the permanence of the interest it rep
resents, and it may make for its destruction. Thi
rrost portentous economic fact at the close of the
century in this country is the decadence in our meat
supply and the startling advance in price to the con
sumer. These things are brought about by the de
struction of pasture on the domain, used
for stock ranging. That pasture is natunJly one of
the great sources of national wealth. When destroyed
the nation has lost cue of its potentialities, and the
public treasury has had no return. â¢
THE STOCK CONVENTION.
BARELY fifteen years have elapsed
since the automatic coin-In-the-slot
machine first appeared in public
places to supply customers with ci
garettes, matches, .chocolates,
sweetmeats, stationery, etc., while in its
latest phase this contrivance â in conjunc
tion with a lighted street lampâ has been
made available for the automatic purvey
ance of hot -water and hot drinks. Surely
it may be thought this extremely utilita
rian invention can only have been due
to the ingenuity of the present generation;
and it is, therefore, startling to learn that
tile automatic machine is one of the old
est projects in everyday use, since It was
known a century before Christ, being the
invention of that great mathematician.
Hero, of Alexandria, who flourished B. C.
117-81.
The explanation of the mechanism in
side the vase was very simple; the vessel
contains another holding the wine, ami
near to the latter is placed a vertical rod
about which turns a well-balanced beam.
When the coin is dropped through the
slot it falls on one end of this- horizontal
beam, which, being depressed, opens a
valve suspended from a chain at the other
end, and the wine commences to flow out
through a pipe.
Hero, according to Good "Words, invent
ed what he termed a "sacrificial vessel
which flows only when money is Intro
ducod." and a full description of this ap
paratus i3 contained in his famous treat
ise on pneumatics, reissued by Â¦Thovenot
royal librarian to I-ouis XIV of France
in the year 1C02. "If into certain saeriflcia
vessels a coin of 5 drachmas be thrown
water or wine shall flow out and sur
round them," so runs the postulate.
The views thus presented "must be given serious
consideration. American society is confronted by a
serious evil, one with which we have had. little ex
perience; and consequently one whose most effective
punishment is unknown to us. The one thing certain
is that something should be done at once. Already
there have come reports of other attempts' at kidnap
ing, the criminals being doubtless incited thereto by
the success obtained in the Omaha case. Nor can
it be questioned that the danger is great. \ If a boy
of 15 can be abducted frbm a public highway in a
well-settled .district and carried off with impunity in
one locality, the same thing can be done elsewhere.
By some means the law should deal out to.it a stern
justice that will deter criminals from attempting it.
Kidnaping differs from other crimes usually pun
ished with death, fn that the perpetrator, after the com
mission of the act. has it in his own power to inflict still
greater injury If the exigencies of his escape from cap
ture require it. The prevailing theory in the Cnarlie
Ross case Is that the little boy was put to death when
It became evident to his captors that his existence in
the flesh embarrassed their chances of evading detection.
If such a result could followâ and If it didn't follow in
the Ross case it might in* some other â when the child
was of tender years (.four years old), and when the pun
ishment was only a term in the penitentiary, what might
not be done by unscrupulous brigands with. a boy of
fifteenâ young Cudahy's age^if detection meant a sen
tence to the gallows? It is Just possible that punishment
may be made so extreme as to defeat its own ends.
There is the further danger that, instead of acting as a
deterrent of crime, the death penalty may, as it does so
often in murder cases, act as a deterrent to conviction
on anything but the strongest form of direct evidence.
It was not to be expected that all should take
the same view of the question. There are many
voices in opposition to the 'death penalty for such
an offense. It is argued by- the Baltimore American,
for example, that the imposition of an extreme pen
alty might produce more evil than good. It says:
The Call has pointed out that under our existing
statutes no adequate punishment is provided for the
crime of abductfon Â»vith the intent of extorting ran
som, and has tentatively, suggested a death penalty
for the offense. A similar view has been taken else
where; and it is reported that in Illinois a strong
movement has been started to procure legislation to
that effect. By reason of that movement the issue
has taken a definite shape in the East, and is. being
extensively discussed there. Â»
PENALTY FOR KIDNAPING.
V/t R. CUDAHV of Omaha is reported to have
/ \ received an anonymous letter warning him
, .. that if he persist in his'efforts to capture the
criminals who kidnaped his son and extorted a ran
som of $25,000 for his release, the "job will be fin
ished with a bullet." The threat of murder is thus
added to the original offense, and another incentive
is given to the immediate adoption of legislation
tending to the suppression of that form of crime.

The century that is now aged less than a day
conies in with all the possibilities that are in agencies
yet untried, though known. From the last one it
takes liquid air; the conservation of solar heat; the
harnessing of the power of the tides. It knows all
about the conservation of force and the transmission
of energy, but must upply that knowledge to forces
not 3 f et utilized. If it solve these problems it m^r
obsolete the steam engine, and antiquate all the de
vices for power that have revolutionized economic
production since 1800.
The centuries have met, saluted and parted. The
old one is history. The new one is hope.
The English language during the last century so
enriched its vocabulary. an^ was so fertilized by the
humus of speech long dead, that the plain people
have to-day a larger vocabulary than students and
scholars could command a hundred years ago. There
fore all vho speak this language think" more than
they did then. Language is but a transportation facil
ity for thought, and with increase in facility comes
enlargement of that which uses it.
Philologists know that the adolescence of races
is marked by the growth of the language they speak.
Rome grew while the I*tin tongue grew. As long
as it assimilated from other languages, absorbed them
end added to its vocabulary and its vigor, the race
that used it grew. And then they died together, not
in a day, nor a century, but they died.
One great fact stands out in the century's record,
and that is the controlling influence of the races'which
speak the English language.
We may fairly take to ourselves the credit .of the
century's great progress in the science of govern':
ment. Our example made men everywhere ea:'gcr to
have a voice in their political destiny, to influence
the measure of taxation they should endure, and con
trol the purpose for which their substance is spent.
The luxuries of a hundred years ago, limited to
the few, ire now 'the comforts freely enjoyed by all.
Since the forehead of man rose above his ears there
lias not been as general diffusion of learning as that
century sa^v. With learning has gone hand in hand
a greater recognition of popular rights. At the cen
tury's beginning the right of the people to some voice
in their government was recognized, practically, only
in this country* and our Government was an experi
ment only thirteen years old. Xow every great
Government except Russia has a parliament through
which the popular will is impressed upon its policies.
The century came in with travel and transporta
tion carried on by horses and cattle and sail ships.
When it went out men traveled and goods were car
ried in fast trains, capable of making a mile a min
ute, and in great steamships that nearly repeat on
the sea the speed of movement on the land.
The nineteenth century was nearly a score of years
old before gas was used for lighting. But it reached
its end in a blaze of electric light, and the watcher*
and the revelers who celebrated its close rode home
in cars lighted and moved by the same agency.
Last night two centuries met at midnight, one to
cease, the other to begin. Since< life, was conscious
of time, countless centuries have met at one point
and second of time, but never has one rolled up iti
scroll as filled with the record of man's progress and
deeds accomplished -.s the nineteenth, and none has
received from its predecessor such a heritage and
held out such exalted promise as the twentieth, oi
our era. The century that ceased so recently that its
pulses are not yet still was peculiarly one devoted to
the application of all the knowledge that man had at
tained before, and to the addition of wisdom and
learning to the heritage of things known, which
it inherited a, hundred years ago. The world we live
in now is so different from that of 1800 that we could
not endure the conditions of that far time.
That cne day is the one that begin as the hand

The indicated horsepower of an engine
is the true measure of the work done
within the cylinder and can be accurately
calculated. The things necessary to be
known in order to make the calculations
(a) The diameter of thÂ« cylinder In
"(b) The length of the stroke .In feet,
(c) The average pressure of the steam
on the piston during the full length of the
stroke. ,
â¢ (d) The number of revolutions per
minute.
To calculate the horsepower or an en
gine proceed as follows:
1. Find the area of the piston. . . - â¢
2. Find the pressure in pounds on the
piston by multiplying the Â«wrea by the
pressure per square inch. . >Â£*
3. Find the space In feet traveled by the
piston per minute by multiplying 1 the
length of stroke in feet by. twice the revo
lutions per minute.
4. Find the units of work done by the
engine per minute by multiplying the an
swer to No.- 2 by.the answer to No. 3.
6. Find the horsepower by dividing the
gross â¢ number . of units .'of work (some
times called foot pounds) by 33,000.

If one were to arrange In order of merit
the three most popular war dramas of
this decade, "Secret Service" vrould un
doubtedly stand first, '. "Shenandoah"
would come in a fair third and "The
Heart of Maryland a bad second.
This last mentioned ' play was mads
much loss by its own merits than by the
refusal of a Chicago millionaire to pay for
Mrs. Ix^slie Carter's tuition In the dra
matic school of.Mr. David Bolasco. Every
one remembers how, on the witness stand,
that distinguished adapter swore he had
drag:gr>d Mrs. Carter around the room by
the hair in order to make her a great
actress, and hundreds of thousands of
people were anxious to see whether the
results of this process were all that Mr.
Relasco claimed for them. Hence "The
Heart of Maryland." with its overheard
conversation?, etc.. antiquated asides, its
banalities, brutalities and bestialities.
Yet, in spite of these defects and in
spite of: Mrs. Carter, iiie play must havo
pome merits or It could hardly have held
the stage as long as it has. These merits
are a somewhat ingenious plot and a skill
ful use of those mechanical stage device?
that are impressive only when their
sources are unknown. Combine thas?
with pood acting and you have a product
that may charm the collars out of many
pockets. But let us not pretend that any
other object is aimed at or hit.

The splendid Christmas programme at
the Orpheum does duty as a new century
greeting, with the addition pf the beauti

hit, which they term a musical concep

Pattern Plate." The Hawthorne sisters in
this selfsame sketch were seen here be
fore, but age has not withered nor cus
tom staled the beautiful conceit. The blo
graph has a series of splendid new views,
which helps to swell the finest vaudeville
show ever offered at the Orpheum.
The war drama is in all its glory at the
Alhambra, where ''Shenandoah" is
filling the body of the house and packing
the galleries. General Sheridan is nightly
ridlng to glory amid the rattle of rlflps
and supposititious boom of muzzle-loading
cannon. Cavalry dash over the Shen
andoah Valley roads; men. begrimed and
gorr, valorously battle and work up a
climatic effect that compels repeated cur
tain calls from a screaming gallery. There
are a few tears also in it and love stories
that are well told by the stage people.
The staging is good and the acting effec
tive. The play will run all the week,
with special matinees to-day and on Sat
urday. .- '

that of the preceding evening was given,
and given with all the trrace and eclat for
which the band is so famed. The menu
was heavier than SuncViy's. including tho
Chopin "Marche Funcbre," orchestrated
by the conductorâ and. by the way, con
taining a rather trivial interpolated trip
let accompaniment in the beautiful trio.
Grieg's "Anitra's Danre" was given with
exquisite finish and shading. The "Sylvia
Pizzicato" was a dainty piece of work
manship, and Ihe Meyer-Helmund waltz,
"The Mountain Spirit," was played. with
a lace-like delicacy and fineness than
which nothing in its own line could be
more delightful. The "Carmen" arrange
ment, arousing a host cÂ£ memories of the
fascinating gipsy's interpreters of the sea
son, was enthusiastically encored for it-*
clever rendering, and Strauss' "Morning
Journal" waltz, an "Evening Song" of
Reineoke'K, and a Strauss galop ended
the' programme. The same infectious
swing, nicety of phrasing, brilliant attack
and perfect ensemble that distinguished
the first night's performance was again
happily in evidence.
California.
The theater last night was like an ice
box. The management owes it to the pub
lic to introduce heating apparatus at
once. L.. DUPONT SYLE.
Theater Js creditable, as is also much of
the acting. Mr." Lefflngwell makes .a cap
ital villainâ so capital that he Is received
nightly with hisses that very properly
amuse him immensely. Miss Darling is
a good emotional actress, judicious in not
tearing the passion co tatters. Mr. Hail
is called upon by the author to represent
The Ideal Manâ always a difficult
thing for anybody with>a sense of humor.
How to be an Angel in Uniform and a
Human Beingâ this is the problem Mr.
Hall is required to solve: he does it with
a combination of manliness and sweetness
that holps to renew one's faith in pour,
fallen human nature. A man who can
forgive David Belasco for writing that
part can forgive anybody anything. Mr.
Charles Arthur (Lieutenant Telfair) i3
a new name to me; he has a pleasant,
manly way with him and bids fair to
develop into an excellent actor.
The most simple and quickest way to

Exercises for Practice.
XotÂ«â In thÂ« follo^ine exercise the date of
the note is given first, then the time as stated
on the facÂ« of the note, then the, date upon
which the note is discounted: it Is required to
find the number of days for which discount Is
to be reckoned. Consider February as having
twenty-eight days.
1. March 20: 3 months: March 20.
2. April 4: 3 months: April 18. = â
S. May 23: 2 .months; May 23.
4. June 15; 4 months; July 3.
5. January 10; 3 months;*February 20.
(5. September :i: 60 days; September 26.
7. October 4: 90 days: October 6.
8. May 20; 90 days: June 25.
9. June 30: 60 days: June 30.
10. August 31; 90 days; October 2.
- Having learned how to find the time, we
proceed to find the discount in precisely
the same manner as we find the interest.
The discount is really the Interest on the
face of the note for the time the banker
has to wait.
Note the following illustration:
A note for $12f<0 Is dated August 3 at
three months and is discounted September
5 at 6 per cent. Find the amount of the
discount.
Due November 3.
September 5 to November 3=a3 days.
Counting both days=60 days.
Discounted for sixty days.
We are required then to find" the inter
est on $1200 for sixty days at 6 per cent.
This you have already learned how to do.
The answer is $12. -i,-
Exercises for Practice.
Notes are not always discounted upon
the day they are made. It is to .the Ad
vantage of the holder to discount only
whpn he ne^ds money, and. besides, many
of the bank's discount only upon certain
days of tho week. The time considered Is
always the time from the day of discount
to the day of maturity.
[ 2. Note dated July 10 at sixty days: dis
counted July 18. Find the time for which
discount is reckoned. 'fei.-vi
This note will be due September 8..
July IS to September 8=52 days.
Counting both days=33 days.
Discount will be reckoned for fifty-three
days.
In the first note the even months are
considered in getting the day of maturity;
in the second note the exact days are con
sidered. The first reads months;, the sec
ond reads days. If days of grace are to bo
considered add three additional days.
1. Note dated May 3 at three months;
discounted June 5. Find the time for
which discount is reckoned.
This note will be due August 3.
June 5 to August S=53 days.
Counting both days=60 days.
Discount will be reckoned for sixty days.
Note the following Illustrations:
The student must remember in taking
up thiij lesson that methods of discounting
differ considerably in different cities and
among different banking institutions.
Bankers and note brokers buy notes at a
discount from their face value. This dis
count is really the interest which they
charge for the use of the money which
the>-, lend, for, as a matter of fact, the
money Is lent and the note is held as se
curity. The rate of discount depends upon
the tightness or abundance of money in
the market, as well as upon the financial
standing- of the persons whose names ap
pear as maker* or Indorsers. Â«
The following general rule for reckoning
time will serve the purpose of thi* lesson.
The student will remember, however, that
this rule is not uniformly adopted by
banking institutions.
In reckoning the time count from the
day of discount to tho day of maturity
and include both days.

ThÂ« Giant Powder Co.. Cbn.. has declared
dividend Xo. 23 of 75 cents per shaÂ£9.
Copper has done nothing startling, variations
remaining within the range of three-quarters
of a cent. Opening at 16V6c, : there were salea
as low aa 16V*c, Â¦ and the close was at the top
at 17c Trade haÂ« been active and - domectle
production pushed. One authority places the
Tin bounded upward from 25Vic at the opening
to 35c in July, and then gradually lost all the
gain. But during the last week there was a
recovery to-27V4c. Â¦ ' Â¦Â¦
Manufactured articles have moved along
similar llnea. Quotations of Iron and steel
products at the beginning of the year were lit
tle below, the level prevailing thirteen years
ago. and the fall was almost uninterrupted un
til October, when the average was but G3.68 per
cent of that prevailing January 1. 1SS7.
It & difficult to Belect one branch of this
Industry cb being pushed harder than another.'
Railway supplies of all kinds have, sold very
freely and the market is flooded with urgent
orders for freight cars. Structural material,
particularly for brldgen and ships, has been In
much better demand than eupply. Steel rails
were reduced from lRst year's price of $35 to
I2Â«. but it was an open secret that the former
figure had only been nominal. for. months prior
to the official change of September. | Contracts
for 1,200,000 tons deliverable during' 1301 have
been placed at $26, and numerous export orders
also suggest the probability: that the list win
be maintained. Â¦.'.&3$& l Â£<t : QSH'*mF!<gcÂ£
Business conditions were satisfactory, how
ever, and demand expanded while exports of
finished products grew heavy when prices
reached a level that made competition possible
with brand producers. In two months ending
December 1 furnace stocks of piglron decreased
118,315 tons, and the tone was bo much Im
proved that many Idle furnaces resumed.
Conditions of iron and steel during 1900 were
much, more 6ound than In the preceding year,'
when speculation wasjrife and prices inflated
far beyond the bounds of reason! Statistics
of the weekly capacity of furnaces In blast show
that the highest point on record was -reached
February 1, while there was little diminution
during the next few months. But with the
collapse of speculation during the spring and
realization of the fact that operations had been
overdone there came a steady. reduction in out
put. Frcm 296 furnaces in blast on February
1 there followed a^continual shutting down
until but twenty-one were In operation on No
vember 1 and the weekly production decreased
82,710 tons. Even at this rapid rate of de
clining output stocks accumulated with start
ling rapidity, and on October 1 the top was
reached at C'0,631 tons. : V' :

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
Stock Exchange with the buying power of the
market maintained, as is evident from the vol
ume of the day's business. In a number of
important etocks the net changes for the day
are impressive. The full strength of the mar
ket was not maintained to the close and prices
showed a tendency to slip back during the
latter part of the day, in spite of the sustain
ing force of extraordinary strength In a few
stocks, fiut the closing day of the year and
the century was nevertheless signalized by the
highest prices for the year or for all past
time In not a few stocks. The most conspicu
ous of these was Pennsylvania, which opened
with an upward rush under a congestion of
buying orders which called for no less than
10.00U shares to be immediately purchased at
the opening. This carried the price up to
149Â«i. The price got back to the high point
at^iin after the opening rush, but did not
hold and closed nearly a point lower. St. Paul
crept up perilously near to Pennsylvania's
level, selling at one time only % below thÂ«
great trunk line stock. The absorption of
Northern Pacific was very heavy, the pried
rising at the opening 3% over Saturday under
a competing rush of orders to buy at the mar
ket. Later In the day thf-re was a recru
descence of strength in the Erie stocks under
the influence of the semi-official announce
ment of the terms of the bond Issue for financ
ing the purchase of the Pennsylvania Coal
Company. The first preferred stock was rush
ed up to 634. which was 5Vi over Saturday.
The prices of all three of the stocks mentioned
were high above all previous records. The
same was true of other stocks in the railroad
list, but the general movement otherwise was
to a large extent In sympathy with the move
ment in this group. This specialized strength
also served as a sustaining force for a vary
larce amount of profit-taking as has constant
ly been the case recently. After the manner in
which London's weakness was Ignored on
Saturday the apprehensions of trouble there
to-day were not looked to for much effect here.
But the unexpectedly favorable aspect of af
fairs there did serve as a fill-up to the market
and London buying here was a factor of
strength, although there was sufficient selling
for that account in other stocks to leave the
buying on balance only small. The strength
of the sterling exchange market In face of
London buying here was very significant. Com
mercial bills of exchange against both cotton
and grain are reported rather scarce, and it Is
asserted that there is some demand for ex
change for remittance of annual obligations to
London. But that special demand for sterling
fa probably to be explained by the lending of
New York money in London. The exigencies
of the London market and the abundance of
funds in New York in spite of all the extra
ordinary demand, point to such a process. The
year closed with a 6 per cent call lain rate.
r.nly momentarily maintained. It ran off after
ward to 3 r*r cent and lower. This was partly
due to the fact that many loans last Friday
were made to carry over until Wednesday.
There was some diminution from the buying
in bonds and prices declined In some portions
of the list, while advancing at others. To
tal sa]*>5. J4.375.000.
The notable r-lapse In the prices of Govern
ment bor.ds Is a significant reminder that the
price premium commanded by the process of
refunding Into the new 2s is no longer payable
by the Government, the refunding operations
ceasing to-dav.

NEW YORK. Dec. 25.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram, says:
The markets here were all disorganized again
to-day on account of the West Australian
mining failures and the consequences of- them.
There were three more failures to-day and
others are virtually certain to come at the
next settlement, since the bulk of the trouble
occurred after this settlement had all been
arranged. The American department was the
chief feature all day. It was buoyant from the
start to the finish, mainly on over-night ad
vices from America and large buying orders
which New York sent early In the morning.
The English public is slill standing aloof re
garding the market as being In the hands of
manipulators Â¦who may pull out the pegs at
any moment. Berlin was a buyer of Penn
sylvania shares. Gold tc the amount of Â£40.000
was taken for Paris and Â£3O.C0O for India.
Money was In strong dtmnnd for the Â«-nd of
the year, but rates were unaltered. Hills went
to 4Vi on a. rumor that the Bank of England
was refusing at less than 5 for terms longer
than January 15.

Lead, fell from $4 70 at the start to $3 75 and
recovered to $4 37. where It haa been maintained
by the smelting companies for many months.
The 'year 1900 opened with;, favorable condi
tions prevailing In nearly every branch of the
dry goods trafle. The home trade was go6d
for. the first three months, and then fell away
until 'by June the market had lapsed tnto pro
nounced dullness, and from a steady upward
courre In prices began gradually to decline
again. The arrest of buying was remarkable.
The cloBinu year of the century was a re
markablo one for farmers and planters, notwith
standing the. fact that some sections harvested
smaller crops than preceding years. While
the South produced less cbtton than' In two
previous -record-breaking Beasons, prices' were
the hlshest.ln ten years.: ami the net profits
made on plantations were enormous. Spring
wheat States lost much grain, but Kansas and
other larce winter wheat growers made bit?
crops, nnd the average price was hleh. In
fact cereals were all abnormally advanced.
But there occurred an actual loss In exports
so that Russian parts were able to procure much
for. foreign trade that had belonged to American
producers. â¢. â¢

Police Court Notes.
Beginning' of the Baby
Century.
It is easy to dato-a marriage from Jan
uary 1. 1801, which is porhaps the reason
why bo many licenses were taken : out
yesterday and why no many clergymen
will be busy to-day. It is a great thing
to turn over a new leaf, settle dpwn,
swear to be good and sober and pet a wife
all In the same day, but thore are twenty
seven men in this city who are willing to
go the length.
They all appeared before Cupid Dan
forth yesterday and pot their licenses and
to-day they win all Jw married. It Is epi
demic, for San Francisco is not the only
place so affected. It augurs well for th-i
city and State, however, and for the new
century, too. To be ushered In with
marriage rites to spare Is a privilege- not
accorded to every year, and 1901, being
the really first of its kind, is doubly hon
ored.

SEATTLE. Dec. 31.â S. X. Baird. treas

way, was held up in Everett last evening
by two masked high.wu.ymen. Balrd was
relieved of $25 In cash end a large wallet,
containing mail and official documents be
longing to the railroad company, which
the robbers evidently thought was ple
thoric with money.
The holdup occurred within four blocks
of the PoPtofHee, in the business part of
town, at 8 o'clock in the. evening. While
the streets were not crowded, there wen>
many pedestrians abroad. The robbers
were disturbed in their work by the ap
proach of 'several perrons, leaving Baird
in possession of his diamond ring and
gold watch.
The highwaymen were two undersized
men and were seen by several persons,
but,- as they were armed, no one had
pluck enough to give chase. It Is thought
the robbers believed Ba!rd to have a large
amount of cash on his person for the pay
ment of company salaries at the first of
the month. After taking the money and
wallet, they returned a bunch of keys at
Balrd's request and then* made off In the

Beautiful Costumes Were the Order
of the Evening and the
Revelers Had No
Masquerade Ball at Pavilion
Draws Crowds From
the Streets.
DANCE AS THE
CENTURY WANES
For a third time within six months thÂ«
guests of the Hotel Bertling, at 736 Bush
street, have had occasion to hurriedly
pack their baggage and make a hasty exit
from the caravansary en account of fire.
Shortly before noon yesterday a blaze that
broke out in the north wing of the hotel
threatened a serious conflagration tn the
block and caused a hasty scramble among:
the occupants of the place.
When the fire was discovered the flames
had almost enveloped the roof of the por
tion of the structure known as the ser
vants' quarters. An alarm wa3 sounded
from box 133, and there was a wild scram
ble among the guests, who soueht a place
of safety.
The fire department quickly responded
to the alarm and the work of fighting the
fire began. The firemen, after a hard bat
tle, prevented the nre from spreading to
the lower stories, and thus a%erted a dan
gerous blaze. The pruest3 continued re
moving their belongings until it was an
nounced that the fire was out.
According to fire reports the Hotel Bert
ling has been visited by the element of
destruction throe times within the last
elx months. On the two previou3 occasions
not much damage was done.
The fire yesterday will cost the. proprie
tors of tho hotel $2^00. ThÂ« roof of the
north wing was badly gutted and a num
ber of rooms were damaged by water.
Flames Are Quickly Extinguished
and Frightened Patrons of the
Hostelry Return to Their
Rooms.
Guests of tha Bertlicg Hur
riedly Pack Their
Btlougings.

The United States transport Grant came,
in from Manila via Hongkong and Naga
saki yesterday. There were four deaths
during the trip and in consequence it was
after 8 p. m. before Dr. Kinyoun released
her.
Those who died during the run were:
December 6. Henry Cioncio, a member of
the band of the Forty-seventh Infantry:
December 15, Carl Miller, Company K,
Thirteenth Infantry; December 24. Henry
P. Miller, corporal Company _Â¦', Twenty
ninth Infantry, and December 26. John
McCall, chief cook of the transport.
Besides these remains the Grant brought
over 121 civilians, among whom are three
press correspondents, seventy-nine dis
charged men and forty-five prisoners. Tha
remains of 398 soldiers, besides thoseof the
ones who djed on the trip, were also
aboard. Th* transport came to an an
chorage oft Folsom-street wharf late last
evening and will probably dock to-day.
She was thirty days from Manila, twenty
five days thirteen hours from Hongkong
and eighteen days eight hours from Naga
saki, .v ",;
THE overdue fleet Is still arriving
and last night there was outside.
bound In, a fleet that has' been
plvlng- the owners some anxiety.
Strange to say, all the vessels had
remained under shelter until the storm
was over and all made remarkably quick
trips down the coast.
The Levt G. Burgess 1 came down from
Tacoma in five days, the W. F, Jewett i:t
two days from the Columbia River, tho
Antelope in three days from. Coqullle
River, the Roy Somers In six, days from
Port Hadlock, the Del Norte in three days
from Coquille River and the Westport in
thirty-six hours. '
Some of the incoming fleet report a
schooner bottom lip off the t Humboldt bar.
The captain of the Sacramento reported
the disaster yesterday and said he
thought it was the scnooner Conflanza
This was proved to be Impossible, how
ever, as the Conflanza did not leave the
Coquille River for San Francisco until
December 28, whereas the ' wreck was
sighted on December 23.
Shipping men have crave fears, how
ever, for the schooner Joseph and Henry,
which left here December 13 for the Co
nuillo River. She was in ballast and when
last seen was making heavy weather of.
It. She carried a complement of five ail
toldâ Captain Rasmussen, Mate Hansen
and three of a crew.
If the Joseph and Henry has gone, all
hands went down with her.
There is absolutely nothing however,
on which to base tha supposition that the
derelict Is the Joseph and Henry. She
left here on December 13 for Coquille Rlv
er.and while she was undoubtedly caught
in the gale, still she may have been driven
off shore and may be still safe.
On December 22 one of the Oregon tug-3
sighted a wreck, bottom up, seventy-flvo
miles west by north of Umpqua light.
On December 23, in almost the same.po
sition,- the schooner Sacramento passed
the same derelict and the captain so re
ported. On his description of the vessel"?
hull seafaring men base their opinion as
to the name of the craft and that is ail
that goes to prove that the derelict was
the Joseph and Henry. .

Livingston Brother's, 123 Post street. It

to semi-annually clear their store of all

room for the succeeding season. At this
time, in anticipation of the early arrival

store. It is the business policy of Living
ston Bros, to carry over no goods from
one season to another, or to permit any
article to become In the slightest way
shopworn. While the advertising of this
sale will be very comprehensive, yet it
will not by any means include all the.: bar

Livingston Bros., though a comparatively
young firm, has . shown- a remarkable
growth. Reliable merchandise, courteous

peared before Judge Conlan yesterday on
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
By consent -the case was continued till
Saturday.
Shortly before 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing "Billy" Abbott arid Crowey were
walking along Stockton street -an^ at
O'Farrell street met Joe Narvaez. Abbott
had a grudge against Narvaez and
promptly began to abuse him. Words led
to Wows and Narvaez went down 'With
Abbott on top of him.
Special Officer Murphy appeared upon
the scene 'and 'tried to pull Abbott off
Narvaez. James C. Stewart went to the
ofticer's assistance. Crowey interfered
Â¦and Stewart â¢ struck him. " Whereupon
Crowey pulled a revolver out of his pock
et ahd fired at Stewart:
The shot was heard by Policemen Fen
nell and Sullivan and Crowey was ar
rested *nd booked at. the City Prison on
a charge- of assault 'with a deadly weap
on. Abbott was also arrested on a charge
of disturbing the peace.
Abbctt was promptly bailed out, and
when he left the prison he met Policeman
Attrtdge on Merchant street. He called
Attrtdge a vulgar name and attacked
him with both hands and feet. There
was a mix-up and when it was over Ab
bott and Attridge each had a black eye.
Attritfge arrested Abbott on charges of
battery and disturbing the peace.
Yesterday Abbott's cases were called in
Judge Fritz's court and continued till
Thursday. The case of Crowey, alias Gar
ner, was called In Judge Conlan's court
and continued till Saturday. -
Crowey has been in trouble before. A
number of: years ago he shot and killed
a man in Napa, but after a long trial he
was acquitted. His parents were wealthy
and he is said to be/ the owner of real
estate in â¢ Napa. Instead of living there
he has preferred to spend most of his
time in the tenderloin in this city.

ON THE WARPATH
The- convention which appointed the
Martin Kelly County Committee was com
posed of delegates who were chosen at 'a
free and easy primary. Ballot boxes were
stuffed and smashed," fraud was recog
nized and violence commended. - Kelly in
person took charge of the convention and
directed its policy. He is now endeavoring
to organize a bunch of Assemblymen fpr
the purpose of doing business at the Leg
islature. So far he has not made much
headway in rounding up the Republican
members of the city delegation, although
the fact is known that the solid support
of the delegation has been promised. The
goods, however, have not been delivered.
It happens that there are several able and
Independent young men in the ranks of
the Republican Assemblymen-elect who
will not take orders from Boss Kelly or
any other boss. They are shrewd enough
to perceive that a primary election law
will put all the bosses out of business and
give the political power of the future to
the voters.
To-morrow night, at Shiels Hall, there
will be a meeting of the Republican Coun
ty Committee appointed under the au
spices of Martin Kelly's B'nai B'rith Hajl
Convention. The old Republican County
Committee of which Aifred Bouvier is
chairman does not appear to recognize the
right of Martin Kelly's committee to take
charge of tho local affairs of the party,
hence a fight is foreshadowed'.
The anti-boss Republicans of ihe city
have not much conlidence ln either com
mittee: In fact, the impression is general
that the Legislature will adopt a primary
election law, which. will permit the Repub
lican citizens to create the next conven
tion and gain control of the local govern
ing body of the party. The rival County
Committees may fight for supremacy
until the next primary election is held.
Bepublicans Care Little for Rivalry,
as They Expect Primary Law.

visit the national capital on a mission of
this character. No aoubt the President
will be glad to see Mr. Shortridge and de
lighted to receive the beautiful ballot box.
It goes without saying that Senators
Perkins and Bard will extend to the
gifted orator and trusted messenger the
glad hand of friendship. It is true that
Mr. Shortridge aspires to public service
in the United States Senate, standing
ready to relieve Senator Perkins of official
responsibility, but this aspiration will not
dull the edge of cordiality when the Sen
ators and the aspirant meet;. .
Californians are pleased to recall an in
cident which occurred at Sacramento four
years ago, when Perkins and Shortridge
were candidates before the Legislature
for the honor of serving in the United
States Senate. In that contest the orator
-was vanquished, but he did not sulk or
threaten to be revenged. On. the contrary,

Two daring hold-ups that recently oc
curred on North Beach have caused much
activity In police circles, and a number of
officers spent considerable time yesterday
In an attempt to run the perpetrators to
earth.
Early Sunday morning two men who
had been drinking in a saloon at Green
street and Montgomery avenue were fol
lowed by a gang of footpads and one of
them was robbed of $40, while the other
man was beaten into insensibility. Yester
day morning shortly after 6 o'clock a Chi
nese laundryman was badly beaten and
robbed of his money on Filbert street, 1
between Stockton and Dupont. The police
are of the opinion that the same crooks
committed both crimes.
The lirst hold-up occurred shortly be
fore 1 o'clock in the morning. James G.
Wright and James Flnnegan, two labor
ers residing at the Adelaide House, on
Howard street, were drinking In a saloon,
and when they took their departure ob
served that they were being followed by
about twelve men. At the corner of Mont
gomery avenue and Green street the gang
attacked them and a lively fight ensued.
Sandbags or heavy clubs were used, and
after a few blows Flnnegan fell insensible
to the ground. The mob then proceeded
to rifle the unconscious man's pockets,
but got nothing except a few article's of
small value. '.
The footpads, disappointed in their at
tempt to rob Finnegan, then turned upon
Wright. They knocked him down and
took $40 from him and then made their es
cape.

was held up ond robbed shortly after 6
o'clock yesterday morning. The affair oc-'
curred on Filbert street. The laundryman
was walking on tho pidewalk when ho was
attacked by a mob. The members of :the
gang searched his pockets and took' all
the money he had. =
Both cases were reported, to the police
and detectives were at once set on the
trail of the offenders. A description of the
footpads "was rrad to the patrolmen -and
the fatter were instructed to keep a sharp
lookout for the'par'ties wanted. ;Â¦

â¢fa-.^ tTDOLPH, Count Festetics de Tol
il jM na> must f ace tn e uncertainties
l^' of the new century alone. A de-
JJ^nV cree of absolute divorce was
granted his wife Eila. Countess
Festetics de Tolna, by Judge Bahrs yes
terday morning. If married life was
pleasant to Count Festetics he may bury
his happiness with the ashes of his yacht
Tolna on the far away Malabar coast, for
he owes what woe the divorce "court has
brought him to the erstwhile existence of
that little vessel. Every ground and cause
of action urged by Countess' Festetics has
been sustained as true by the court, while
the brand of untruth has been stamped
on the pages of Count Festetics' deposi
tion, wherein he assailed the honor of his
wife in defense of his own.
Months ago the ashes of the Tolna were
swept up by the sea. The pig that lent Its
odorous presence to the unhappy environ
ment of the Countess aboard the yacht
has long been dead, and the cockroaches
that infested the cabin were lost with the
ship. The Malay crew that frowned dark
on the deck and auded to the Countess'
terror are scattered far, and now the
Count has lost his Countess. The last
chapter of the cruise of the; Tolna. has
been written and the last link of associa
tion has passed from the life of the Aus
trian nobleman. He may take, an appeal
to the Supreme Court, it is true, but out
of the mass of testimony introduced in
support of and against the action for di
vorce Judge Bahrs has taken the salient
parts, and the weight of evidence is
against the defendantâ Count Festetics.
Tolna Their Only Home.
After reviewing the facts of the court
ship and marriage of Count Festetics and
Ella Haggin and going over the log of the
Tolna. as quoted in detail in Countess
x estetics* complaint. Judge Bahrs says:
Count Festetics never at any time since his
marriage oiTered the Countess a home or place
of abode other than the yacht Toina. During
the long cruise of the yacht Countess Festetics
underwent many hardships, suffered privations
and perils and was at long intervals without
the companionship of any woman. This life
frequently undermined her health. Speaking
of Countess Festetics' life on the yacht, Mrs.
Ross Thomson, a witness called for the plain-
â¢ "I became acquainted with the Countess and
Count in the summer of 1S96. They came there
in their yacht, and just before they came in
they met with a terrific storm, in which the
yacht nearly foundered. It was a terrific ty
phoon. The yacht arrived there in a very dis
abled condition, her main mast being gone. It
was a very small yacht and the cabin where
the Countess lived was a tiny place, quite
unfit. I should say. for a lady to live in.
Yacht W*s Very Dirty.
"It was very dirty and a pig was running
around the deck. There were a great many
cockroaches all over the place. It. was crowded
and generally had a very untidy appearance.
I have never known a lady before or since to
live In that manner, and It waa the subject of
general remark at that place. The crew was a
mixed lot, mostly natives. There were some
South Sea Islanders brought up from the
islands. They were not a lot I should want a
lady to be left with. I saw no American or
English sailors. The Count was ofen away
from the ship at night. The Countess' health
was not good and she had a very bad cough,
which she waB unable to get rid of for almost
a year. I got quite worried about it. I have
repeatedly heard her express the desire for a
home on shore. She stayed on shore when
she was invited to stay at people's houses.
Aside from their stay on the yacht
the Count was very brusque to the
Countess, very impol'.te. very surly, disagree
able and very neglectful. He paid her no at
tention whatsoever. This want of attention
manifested Itself in absolute Indifference and
neglect. The Count never approached the
Countess. He never went near unless she
GANG OF TOUGHS
ROBS THREE MEN
The outcome of tho court-martial of
Captain Nippert, N. G. C, for having
made a false parade Â»eport in connection
with the turnout of the First Infantry
Regiment on the 9th of last September has
been the formulating of charges against
Colonel Thomas F. O'Neil, commanding
the regiment. They arc preferred by Ma
jor Margo, brigade inspector. The
charges, which for several days have be^in
in the possession of Major D. S. Dorn.
judge advocate of the Second Brigade, ara
based upon a report and the testimony
given at the court-martial of Captain Nip
pert. They set forth that the colonel, who
at the. time was lieutenant colonel, com
manding the regiment, signed a reporc
certifying that Captain Nippert, com
manding Company F, paraded forty-four
men, when, in fact, as it was shown a;
the court-martial, Nippert did not parada
his company at all and that at the time
the accused signed the regimental report
he was aware of that lact.
The charges have not yet been transmit
ted to General Warrleld, commanding tho
Second Brigade, but as soon, as they aro
a court-martial will bo ordered and tho
accused will have to lace the charges.
It was stated that the presentation of
the chargps would be postponed until af
ter the commander in chief, had passed
upon the NIppert case, but General War
field stated last night that charges will
be preferred irrespective of any action
that may be taken in the NIppert case.
The . charge against Colonel O'Neil is
for a violation of section 8 of the articles
of warÂ» which reads:
Every officer who knowingly makes a 'false
return to the Department of War or to any of
hib superior officers authorized to- call for such
returns- of the state of. the regiment, troop or
company or garrition under his command, or of
the arms, ammunition, .'clothing or other store*
thereunto belonging, shall, on conviction there
of before a cou.rt-martlal, be cashiered.
The making of a false return as Inter
preted, by Lieutenant Colonel George B.
Davis, assistant .judge advocate of the
United States army, is, as follows:
It is .no matter in what the falsehood may
ccnslGt, whether in the number or quality, of
troops of which they purport to be a true ac
count. Whether the deficiency I arose from a
fixed or occasional cause, as from the tempo-,
rary absence, of men, it is the duty of every
.officer -to return things as they are. The of*
fense will be complete if the returns are not
true with the knowledge of those interested in,
making them in any one particular represented.
All military acts and operations must be under
taken on a confidence in such returns, and any
deceit discovered in them, as It might affect
any military plan, is visited with a punishment
severe and terrible.
Co-lonel Davis also holds that an officer
cannot plead . ignorance, for in so doing
it would be admitting a violation of an
other section of the articles of war.
Colonel O'Neil does not at thfs time de
sire to express himself, in relation to ths
matter as he has not been served with a
copy of the charges. â¢' . '

called him. She might have been an absolute
stranger to him so far as his actions wont.
When shq spoke to him he answered, that was
all." .
Countess' Health Impaired.
â¢ In her complaint Countess Festetics stated
that In the month of April, 18S9, the defendant
declared his Intention to sail to Colombo. Cey
lon and other places in the Indian O:ean, thence
to the cast coast of Africa. He requested the
Countess to prepare for the voyage.- Prior to
the month of Acril, 1399, the health of the
Countess had been greatly Impaired by her life
upon the yacht and the constant dangers at
tending the eame, and at this time she again
besought the Count to abandon the yacht and
their mode of Jiving thereon and secure some
place on land' convenient and satisfactory to
hlmeelf, which he could have done at no greater
expense. than that of maintaining a yacht. Tho
contemplated voyage to Colombo and. other lo
calities was fraught with great and i unusual
dangers and privations and was entirely beyond
the strength of the Countess; as she informed
the Count at the time he announced his Inten
tion, but he refused to comply with her re
quest or to change his plan. The Countess
there told the Count that it was impossible lor
her to live any longer upon the yacht. These
allegations I find are sustained by the evidence
in the case, many of them being supported ay
the Count fcimseff. * .. . ' -
Count's Charges Are False.
As to Count Festetics' allegations re
garding Countess Festetics' "big flirta
tion" with one Remington of the British
ship Immortalite, the court says:
I can state that in my opinion this affair with
Remington appears to me to be a Btudied effort
on the part of the Count to maliciously magnify
a very natural occurrence inu> some act of im
propriety On the part of the Countess. Even
the Count's version of the affair makes It savor
more of uncalled for Jealousy than a transgres
sion on the part of the Countess. After giving
his version of the Remington affair, the Count
proceeds and says:
'â¢When my wife came down below I told her
I had had quite enoiich of this sort of flirta
tion, having already seen her engage in similar
flirtations at Samoa and Yokohama, and that I
had had enough of this sort. of thins, and told
her, 'You would better pack up and go back
to your people.' She said, 'All right.' and tak
lnjr her hat went to the telegraph office."
Further testifying, the Count in reply to the
Countess' request to live on land, said: "If
your people give me the amount they promised
me as you know before our marriage, that is. a
million francs, then 1 can give up the yacht
ing- and live on shore."
It appears, therefore, that the Count up lo
the 20th day of April, 1899, never offered the
Countess any hoime or ether place of abode
other than the yacht. Â¦ His testimony Justifies
the conclusion that he did not Intend to do so
in the future, and It is not claimed by him
that he ever did offer the Countess any home
on land since the date mentioned.
Conclusions of the Court.
The court lias no hesitation In concluding that
the yacht and the mode of living thereon was
grossly unnt for the Countess as a home and
place of abode, and that she could not live as
he elected to live without great risk to and im
pairment of her health, and without being sub
jected to extraordinary dangers and privations.
On April 20, 1839, the Count sailed away on
his yacht for Colombo and left Countess Fes
tetics at Singapore without money or means
of subsistence other than that which had been
transmitted to her by her parents. Since April
20, 1839, the defendant has failed to furnish
Countees P'estetlcs with means of livelihood and
she is hence wholly dependent upon her parents
for her maintenance and support.
From Countess' Festitics letters to her hus
band and mother U appears that she never had
any Intention of deserting the Count, as they
were couched in terms of endearment and af
fection, and hint at some future prospect of
reunion, but Count Festitics' letters became
cold and formal. He did not offer Countess
Festetics a home. He did not send her any
purport: in short, his actions Justified the be
lief that he had grown indifferent to her. and
her suit for divorce was but the logical result.
I have no hesitation in stating that the fore
poing state of facts, which find ample support
In tho evidence, entitle Countess Festetlca to a
divorce from Count Festetics upon all the
grounds alleged in the complaint, and It is so
ordered.

I Then occur irregularities, suppressed or painful menstru-
I ation, weakness, indigestion, leucorrhoea, general debility,
6 and nervous prostration.
I They are beset with such symptoms as dizziness, faint-
I ness, lassitude, excitability, irritability, nervousness, sleep-
I lessness, melancholy, " all-gone " and ** want- to-be-left-alone "
| feelings, blues, and hopelessness. Â©
I In such cases there is one tried and true remedy. Lydia
I E. Finkham's Vegetable Compound at once removes
I such troubles. The following letters prove this. They also
I prove the value of Mrs. Pinkham's advice.
i " Dear Mrs. PnrcHAif :â I take pleasure in writing you a few lines
I thanking yon for your advice. I did just as you told me in taking your
H medicine, and owe my life to you. You are lilte a mother to your sex. I
I was awfully sick, â¢was all run down and felt sick all over. I looked like a
| person brought out of the grave. My face was as white as the driven snow.
E I was always tired after doing a little work and would have to sit down.
I I was troubled terribly with headaches and my appetite was not g-ood ; Â¦
I also, troubled with shortness of breath something 1 awful for about a month.
I I could not go up one flight of stairs without being tired and having to 'Â¦
1 stop to f*et my breath. I was feeling just as miserable as could be. I took
I two bottles of Lydia E. Plnkham's Vegetable Compound
I and cannot express my thanks to vou for what 3*our medicine has done for
I me. 1 * â MISS M. F., 35 Devon St., 6rove Hall, Roxbury, Boston, Mass. j j

I *' DeIs Mes. Ptxkham :â I write this letter for you to publish for the
1 benefit of poor, suffering women. Lydia E. Pinkhatn's Vegetable
Â¦ Compound has done me a gTeat deal of good. I have taken three
I bottles and feel like a new woman. When I begtin the use of your medi-
I cine I was hardly able to be up ; could not do half a day's work. I ached
I from head to foot, was almost crazy, had those bearing-down pains, and
I stomach was out of order. Now aU of these troubles have left me and I
I can work every day in the week and not feel tired." â MRS. JENNIE
