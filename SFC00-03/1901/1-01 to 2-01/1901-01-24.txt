by a captata> escort of the Horse Guarde.
The procedure was exactly as on levee
By the time the King arrived a great
[ gathering of Privy "councilors in levee

taken up position* in the thronerocm-

dom according: to its Iaw3 and customs,
and hear him assume the title of King
Howard VII of Great Eritain and Ireland
and Emperor of India. The ceremony
Â¦was interesting and according to prece

latter the Duke of Devonshire. Lord Pres
ident cf the Council, formally comunl-
C2ted the death of Queen Victoria ar.d the
Euccession to the throne of her son. the
Prince of Wales. The Uoyal Dukes, with
certain Lordi? of the Council, were then
directed to repair to the King's presence
f> ewja'.r.t him with the terms of the
ord President's statement.'
Mingling with the loyal Dukes and
,,reat personages of the kingdom were a
I few men in plain clothee to represent the
' fact that the Â§gjÂ»eral public have a nomi
nal right to be present- The King won*
& field marshal's uniform and the ribbon
of the Order of the Garter. As he began j
his epeech hiÂ» voice was painfully broken
with emotion, but he recovered as he
went on.
Shortly afterward his Majesty entered
the room to which the councilors were
assembled and addressed them In a brief
epeech. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Salis
bury) then administered the oath to the
King. Afterward the carious members of
the Council, commencing with Lords in
Council, took the oath of allegiance and
then passed in tarn before his Majesty as
et a levee, excepting that each paused
and kissed the King's hand before passing
out of the chamber. This brought lhÂ»
ceremony to a close*
By 2:30 p. m.. when his Majesty returned
Maryborough Hot^e, the crowd In the
T^ighborhood was of immense proportions.
TV? King's prior Journey was accom
plished in almost complete silence, but on
tkis occasion he "was lustily cheered all

with mourning bands on their arms. An
enuerry was seated beside him. The King i
wss. of course, dressed in the deepest and j
most simple mourning, and carefully j
mJsed his hat in acknowledgment of the Â¦
eilent uncovering of heads, which was j
raore lmprÂ»**ive than the most enthusias- j
tie cheers. The King looked tlre-1 and '
\-ery Â«ad. but very well. Following him ,
came the Duke of Tork, the Duke of Con- i
naught and others. Both the King and i
the Duke of York looked pathetically up j
at Buckingham Palace as they passed, and j
acknowledged the salute of the guard of ]
honor drawn up inside the palace grounds. J
The troops there and elsewhere showed no
signs cf mourning, except that the bands
were not present, btt all the officers had

m. â At 11 o'clock this morning: the mem
bers of the royal family will gather
around the body of the late Queen, which
lies in a simple coffin, the chapelle ar
dente. festooned with red and white hang
ings. The Bishop of Winchester, standing
before an altar removed for the occasion
from the private chapel, will read a por
tion of the service for the dead.
The coffin rests on a specially erected
platform draped' with royal purple, the
feet lying: to the east. The head faces
the simple altar. Over the features is a
thin veil.
For a ffcw hours before this service the
public will be admitted to the room and
allowed to view the remains of the sov
ereign who for so long 1 ruled over them.
The body will rest there until Sunday,
and It is probable that no removal will
occur for ten days.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns that the cause of the
Queen's death as officially given was
"senile decay."
The doctors have adopted this expres
sion as most suitable and. truthful. They
attribute the paralysis which attacked
her as secondary to the general -weakness
of her condition, nor Is It considered ad
visable, for reasons of state, to' Intimate
that her Intellect was dimmed 'Â¦Â¦ by that
particular form of disease.
Details of the dying hours were not ob
tainable until last evening. It appears
that the Queen was moved on Sunday
from her big bed into a small cot especial
ly built with spring?, which was .Bur

the doctors to reach the patient easily on

VANCOUVER, B. C. Jan. 23.-Two hun
dred and fifty miners who have been on,
strike for four months in. the Alexandria
mines on Vancouver Island axe in
straitened circumstances. Some of them
are actually threatened with starvation.
According to a letter sent to-day by the
secretary of the miners' union to the Clty
Council of Xanaimo and to coast newspa
pers, there are families which are in want
of daily necessities. Special arrangements
haVe been necessary to supply them with,
the food they have required from day to
day. A fund is being raised in Nanalmo
and the assistance already given will re
lieve immediate wants.
The idle miners compose the entire pop
ulation of South Wellington. On account
of a dispute in wages last September the>
men threatened to strike and at the sama
time the management of the Dunsxnuir
Colliery Company posted a notice to the
effect that tAe closing of the mines had
been In contemplation for some time and
ordered all men to leave their work at
once.

MENTO, Jan. 23.â The Senate has
passed the joint resolution intro
duced by Cutter, asking that Dr.;
J. J. Kinyoun be : removed from
the quarantine service of thia coast, and
in passing It treats the quarantine
officer to a roasting that for . a time
has driven away rain and fog and has
raised the. mercury in thermometers in
this, section generally. An attempt 'was
made to cause a delay with motions and
counter motions, but the Senate .'.; Boon
sifted the proceeding down to the - main
question, and sent the resolution -through
by a vote of 20 to 9. The resolution is as
follows: ; -
Vhofe matter to the Health Committee.
Bhortridge spoke of a stand in mpport of
the attitude of the Governor, who,'- he
said,: was practically on trial in the mat
ter. Rowell said that while he was not
prepared to pass upon Klnyoun's Judg
ment in the matter of , plague, the fact re
mained that Kinyoun's actions had been
hasty, unreasonable and overbearing and'
while the resolution asking Kinyoun's re
moval was not exactly to his liking, stilL
he would vote for it.
Cutter declared that the substance of
the whole proposition was not a question
of the- plague, but was contained in the
fact .that, â¢ in -his baffled rage -over the
action of the United States court in rais
ing the "quarantine on Chinatown in San

STATE SENATE DEMANDS
DR. KINYOUN'S REMOVAL
The Governor Is squarely opposed to
the inheritance tax. He calls it taxing a
man for dying. He reasons that a man
who has accumulated a fortune to leave
to his children or other heirs has paid
all of the taxes on the property during
the years of its accumulation, and that
â¢subsequent tax on the inheritance Is
double taxation, grievous and oppressive.
"1 venture the opinion, therefore, in the
light of the past history of the university,
that standing taxes for its support are
not as productive of benefit to that
splendid crown of the common schools as
appropriations passed by each Legis
lature according to its increased or di
minished necessities."
Responding to inquiries yesterday the
Governor spoke frreiy of university af
fairs, expressing his admiration for the
institution at Berkeley. He said distinct
ly that he was not demanding the re
peal of the perpetual tax. On the con
tiary he was In lavor of supplying the
university with the money required for
its support. If more money were needed
than ih<Â» perpetual tax afforded, it should
be provided by direct appropriation. /In
his message, however. hÂ« made this sug
gestion to the Legislature:
The term of Daniel E. Hayes as a mem
ber of the State Board of Prison Directors
expired last January. Until recently it
was supposed that he would be reap
pointed for a term of ten years, or at
hast serve until the close of the present
State administration; but late develop
ments retarding the management of San
â¢Juentin Prison cause a surmise that Gov
ernor Gage will soon announce the numa
of a new Director.
Politicians are slightly disturbed by a
rumor -that the Governor will make no
appointment until the Legislature ad
journs. They maintain that the appoint
ment should be made before the end of
the legislative session, so that confirm
ation by the Senate could give clear title
to the office for a term of four years. It
is readily admitted that the appointee of
the Governor would take his seat in the
board and hold office until the Legisla
ture of 1903 convened, but it is said that
he might not hold lodger. The point is
raised that a Democratic Governor might
be chosen in the mean time and that he
could recall the nomination made by the
f>resent Governor and send to the Senate
or confirmation the name of another per
son. The politicians hold that danger of
a Democratic administration of State af
fairs is remote, yet titty insist that no
chances should be taken. -V,-. â¢
Governor Gape arrived In this city from
Ijos Angeles yesterday forenoon and left
for Sacramento at 6 p. m. He was busy
at the Palace Hotel until nearly train
lime. It was understood that affairs con
cerning San Quentin Prison and the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners engaged
his attention. Several well known appli
cants for the honor and emoluments of
service on the corritalsslon were in the
court of the Palace. Major P. J. Har
ney'fi four-year term as Commissioner
will expire on March 19 next and appli
cants to pucceed him are legion.
"It is to be hoped that our Sena
tors and Representatives in Congress
may induce the United States Gov
ernment to make up this shortage
without further demands upon the
State; but should this be- found im
possible, and should the national
Government insist that the original
plan obligated the State to pay half
of the expense of the completed work,
then, in view of the great benefit to
be derived, rather than see the work
fail or remain incomplete after the
expenditure of $500,000 thereon, of
which sum the State has already ap
propriated Â§250,000, it would be
well perhaps to make an appropria
tion for the payment of half of such
balance."
Dispatches from Sacramento represent
that Assemblyman Ralston "of-- Calaveras
is holding up the appropriation. It was
surmised that he received a hint from the
Governor that an appropriation of $150,000
was undesirable. As the Governor In his
message practically recommends the al
lowance, the representatives of the min
ing interests In California arc wondering
from what source Ralston is obtaining his
inspiration to light the appropriation.
Governor Gagre has not taken a ftand
in opposition to the measure appropriat
ing $150,000 to complete the work project
ed for the protection of mining and agri
cultural interests. In his message to the
Legislature he said:
â¢â¢You will observe that, in order to final
ly complete the. work undertaken, either
the State alone or the nation and State
will be required to furnish $300,000.
Friends and supporters of the State
University are not alarmed ! or uneasy
concerning the Governor's attitude
toward the institution. It is called to
mind that the Governor appointed to the
Board of Regents such eminent men as
Stephen M. White, WÂ« II. L. Barnes,
George C. Pardee and A. W. Foster. The
incident Is also recalled that the Gov
ernor actively favored the election of
Benjamin lde Wheeler to the /presidency
of the university. ;c";:
Mellck, v Carter and Savage made
speeches in favor of the measure, and
throughout the debate it was evident that
Southern California was lined up solidly
for it. The San Francisco delegation
voted against it almost to a man.
The committee on contested elections
made its report of the contest of Lacy
versus Franklin in the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict and recommended that Franklin be
declared regularly seated. A resolution
to .that effect, offered by the committee,
was adopted.
â¢ A resolution offered by Henry of San
Francisco directing the sergeant-at-arms
to exclude "Long John" "Wilkins from tha
Assembly chamber was promptly shelved.
Henry said in its defense that he and
every other member of the house was be

MENTO. Jan. 23â The bills ap

for impounding debris fared well
fit the bands of committees to-day, for
the Assembly bill was favorably consid
ered by the Assembly Committee on
Mines, when it was feared there was dan
ger* of it being turned down, and the Sen
ate bill of similar import was similarly
dealt with by the Senate Finance Com
minee. Doth will be recommended for
passage in the separate houses to-morrow.
In view of an antag-onlem to the bill

Fornething of a row, and there were some
words over the measure, but in the end
there was no dissenting voice when a vote
v.-as taken on a motion that the bill be
reported back with the recommendation
that it pass. It wa? a viva voce
vote, however, and Ray. Duryea and Rals
ton, the three who spoko against the bill,
did not vote either tray.
Lieutenant Governor JCeff was present,
bvA when the bill came up for consider
ation he was asked to address the com
mittee. He was- deeply interested in the
measure, he said, and he did not under
ttifnd the antagonism to it, in view of
the pledges made to Congressman Woods
and the representations he' had made in
Congress.
Ray of Coulterville, a Democrat, was
the first to speak against the bill. He
said the general opinion was that the bill
was a mining measure pure and simple.
but he had always be^n sure it was a
compromise measure. He referred also to
a threat he had heard to the effect that
the valley men would not allow the ear
ning on of hydraulic mining:, even be
hind the barriers proposed, and he wished
to know how much better off the miners
would be then.
Irish subsequently disposed of this con- fl
tfntion ny saying that with the dams ,hyÂ«
draulic mining would not Injure the farm
ers, and therefore they could have no.
cause upon which to enjoin the miners.
Ray also declared that Colonel Heuer of
"Now as to this $150,000, I'll vote for it
because I think it is a benefit to the riv
ers and harbors of California, but I
don't think it will .benefit the miners one

and promises made and the assurance on
the part of Colonel Heuer that no work
woufd be done until the whole appropri
ation was in sight. They denied that
the dams were for the benefit of the
rivers, for the rivers were getting along
very well without them, and they main
tained that thia plan was the only- means
found, after years of Investigation of
the- question, that would allow the hy
draulic miners to work without damage
to the country below them.
Ralston and Ray declared more than
once that Colonel Heuer. had made con
tradictory statements,, but Irish silenced
comment of that kind by stating that
Colonel Heuer : had courted questions
after his address to the committee, and
It looked as if he "had purposely been al
lowed to go unquestioned in order that
his statements migrht â¢ be brought up in
his absence, when he could not set them
right.
A vote was then taken on the propo
sition to recommend that it do pass, and
it was carried.
the Debris Commission had said that $o00,
000 was more than he could use in a long
time, and Governor NeflT Interrupted to
call attention to Heuer's statement that
nor one dollar would be used until the
SSOO.000 was in sight
Duryea was also in doubt as to the
propriety of voting for the appropriation
before It was needed, despite the fact that
the bill makes it payable two years from
now. He maintained the bill . was a
river and harbor improvement measure,
and could not be considered a miner's
measure.
Ralston spoke in the same strain, the
burden of his words being that the $150, ~
000 should not be appropriated until . the
$500,00$ or part -of it had been expended.
In conclusion he paid:

Republican Assembly Caucus
Adds to the Attache List.

Special Dispatch tÂ« The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 23.â The hunger for
patronage is .not yet appeased.
Disregarding the strong adverse
sentiment created by former re
peated additions to the list of attaches,
a Republican caucus .this afternoon de
cided' to give "five more men positions
where they will be able, in the words of
Grove L. Johnson, "to render valuable
service to the State." .
The caucus was not a harmonious one
by any means, and the place-hunting
Â¦ schemes were carried through against the
judgment of a large number of the mem
bers, malnly^by virtue of the strength
of lungs of the San Francisco crowd, as
sisted .by the favors of Joe Kelley, chair
man of the caucus, and the parliamentary
skill of Johnson. ;.-. '
Jacob Steppacher is to be put on the
salary roll as a" reapportionment clerk.
In -reality he is to be a clerk to the San
Francisco delegation, mainly to look out
for its. reapportionment Interests. When
the proposition was first made in the cau
cus It was voted down, but Johnson intro
duced another resolution to the same ef
fect, and when It came to vote the San
Francisco delegation shouted louder than
before : and the resolution was declared
adopted, 'Steppacher will get $5 a day.
He would have been called a committee
clerk, but that would have fixed his sal
ary at $4.
Thomas Delahanty. a member of the Re
publican County Central Committee of
San Francisco, will be made clerk of the
Committee on Engrossment and enroll
ment. . Franklin, Martin Kelly's man from
the Twenty-eighth District and chairman
of the committee, asked for the appoint
ment, frankly stating that Delahanty had
been hanging around him ever since he
had been in Sacramento, and that he had
to feed him and was getting tired of it
Hourigan, author of telephone bills, also
said that he had been helping to feed I>el
ahanty and wouldn't star.u for It any
longer. ' This argument was convincing,"
and, although It was pointed out that tha
committee already had a clerk, Franklin's
resolution was adopted.
The first question that came up in cau
cus was a proposal to place two tempo
rary appointees of Sergeant-at-Arms
Banks on the regular pay roll. Banks
Â¦was sent tor and said that the extra men
were needed, especially in view of tha
extra railing that is to be put hi for
the "members' â¢ lobby." Some one said
it was specifically understood that extra
attaches 'were not to be detnanded on
account of the new lobby, but no one ven
tured an explanation.
Then "Major" William Geary was
named as a tile clerk, although two men
have been successively appointed to that
position and each in turn transferred to
other positions not statutory.
After Jake Steppacher had been taken
care of and Franklin had put forth -his
unique but successful plea for a special
clerk, the caucus adjourned and Marti a
Kelly, who was waiting outside In tha
corridor, was joined immediately by
Franklin in high glee.
Kelley -will be under the necessity of
offering the resolution to-morrow placing
these additional attaches on the pay roll,
and will have to face a minority already
indignant at repeated raids of this sort
on the treasury and also a large number
of Republicans who feel outraged by this
latest and boldest bit of treasury looting.
It will not be a pleasant position for tha
caucus chairman and the resolution will
not be adopted -without a fight.
Among the men who protested in cau
cus, but who will have to be Bllent In tha
face of Democratic criticism, are Rad
cliff. Brown of San Mateo. Webber.
Knowland and Macbeth.

ADVEETISEMENTSr
HAVE YOU ANY OF THESE
Symptoms of a Very Common
â¢ Trouble P.
There Is no disease so common In the
United States as catarrh because it ap-
pears ln so many forms and attacks so
many different organs.
It is a common mistake to suppose that
catarrh is confined to the nose and throat.
Any inflammation of the mucous mem-
brane wherever located accompanied by
abnormal secretions is catarrh." Catarrh
of stomach or bladder, or intestines is
r.early as common as nasal catarrh and
much more serioue, although- it Is true
that stomach catarrh and catarrh of oth-
er internal organs is the result of neg-
lected nasal catarrh.
A new remedy -has recently appeared
which so far as tested seems to be re-
markably effective ln promptly curing ca-
tarrh, wherever located. The preparation
is sold by druggists generally under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and in addi-
tion to being very palatable and conveni-
ent, possesses extraordinary merit, ln
many cafes giving immediate relief from
the coughing, hawking and constant
clearing of the throat and head, those
symptoms with which evervone Is famil-
iar who has ever suffered from colds in
the head and throat. ... * Â¦..'Â¦Â¦
Â¦ Catarrh IS* simply a , continuation of
these symptoms -until the trouble becomes
chronic and grows gradually worse from
year to year. . vâÂ»
6tuart's Catarrh Tablets are composed
of Hydrastln. Eucalyptol. Gualacol and
Elmllar antiseptics and catarrh â¢ specifics,
from which -it will be seen that so secret
Is made of the Ingredients and also that
no mineral poisons are used, as is the
case with many well-known catarrh med-
icines. - >..,
For catarrh of the nose, throat, bron-
chial tubes, for catarrh of stomach. In-
testines or bladder no preparation is so
eafe and gives such rapid and permanent
results as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50c for full
Flzed package. You can use them with
assurance thaxyou will not contract the
cocaine or morphine habit as the results
from this catarrh cure are apparent from
tbe first day's use. *.

Laxative Bromo-Qutnlne removes the cause.*At a meeting of British and American
residents of San Francisco last evening
In the offices of Dr. D'Evelyn, plans were
considered for funeral services in memory
of the late Queen Victoria. The meeting

sympathy caused by the death of the be
loved Queen of England.
Mr. Harrison outlined the plan of the
funeral service which will be held In the
Mechanics' Pavilion on the same date as
that on which the funeral service will be
\eld in England. Consul Pickersglil ex
pressed thanks for the spontaneous dis
play of sympathy shown In San Francisco
when the news of the Queen's death was
made known. The presidents of the vari
ous societies Indorsed the plan outlined
by President Harrison and the various
resolutions presented were carried unani
mously.
Mechanics* Pavilion was tendered by
the trustees at a nominal rate. The ser
vice will consist of religious and> musical
exercises. Rev. Dr. Clampett. Rev. Dr.
Hemphill and Rev. Dr. Gardner were ap

tions to the city and State officials, army

the little feliow asked his father for a

go she committed the crime. While the,
father was at the barn hitching up the

the house and with a 3S-callbâ¬r revolver
shot him, the ball entering at the rlgh*

one-fourth of an inch deep. When asked
for the details of the hazing, she refused

of "Victoria, the noble woman and wise

dolence to her bereaved subjects. A pre
amble of 500 words highly eulogizing the

Great Britain's Itepresentative at
Washington Receives Messages
of Condolence From Many
Sources.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 23.â The British
Embassy Is shrouded in gloom to-day and
the heavy hangings of black within and
without the stately old mansion give
tribute to the memory of the departed
Queen. The Eritish flag hangs at half
mast above the porte cochere fronting the
building. Around the royal arms which
top the portico hang heavy masses of
black, and from the large columns are
draped long bands of crape. All the cur
tains of the embassy are drawn and the
entire place presents an aspect of silence
and mourning.
Lord Pauncefote remains In retirement
with his family and staff most of the
time, only occasionally seeing some dis
tinguished caller who comes to pay a
tribute of respect and condolence. These
cosdeiences have come In "the " most
abundant form and testify to the - wide
spread feeling which the death of the
Queen has awakened in all classes. They
come In the form of notes, telegraphic
messages and cards, running into the
hundreds, besides the many personal calls
which the officials of the Government and
of the diplomatic corps have paid. The
sentiment of this Government w-as the
first to express Itself In the calls of the
entire membership of President McKin
ley's cabinet. Including Secretaries Hay,
; Gage. Lorg. Wilson, Hitchcock, Attorney
General Griggs and Postmaster General
Smith and the leaving of cards from Sec
; retary Root, who is confined to his home.
The British officials throughout the coun
; try also have taken occasion to send their
expressions of grief.
The official announcement of the Gov
ernment as to the procedure to be fol
lowed has not come. For the time being
there is little to do but testify In silence
to the affliction which has come upon the
British nation, and then to take up the
business under the new sovereign. Lord
Pauncefote and his family attend St.
John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette
Square, fronting the White House, which
will be the place of commemorative ex
ercises if any are directed from London.
The rector of the church. Rev. Dr.
Mackay-Smith, called on the Embassador
to tender the use of the church for this
purpose, but in- the unsettled condition of
the arrangements no final reply could be
given. There had been some doubt
among the British officials here whether
Parliament would be Immediately as
sembled, but . the announcements from
London appear to make this certain. Lord
Pauncefote is a member of the House of
Lords, but It Is hardly expected It will
be necessary for him to go to London to
attend the session under the new sover
eign and to receive the new credentials of
Embassador from King Edward VIL

Ratification of the Spanish Treaty,
However, Makes Am erica's
Title Clear.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.â Official corre
spondence between the Duke de Arcos,
Spanish Minister in "Washington, and the
Madrid Government relative to the sale
of Sibutu and Cagayan, Sola Islands, to
the United States, shows that Great Brit
ain Intimated to the State Department
that she had certain rights to Sibutu
which she might press for consideration.
Any such rights, according to adniinia
tratio^ officials, will disappear with the
formal proclamation of the treaty rati
fied yesterday by the Senate, which will
soon occur. The treaty cedes the Islands
absolutely to this Government, giving a
clear title, and If the British Government
has any complaint u> make she must sub
mit It to the Madrid Government. The
correspondence also shows that Secretary
Hay made a strong effort to purchase the
Islands for $30,000. but In view of the In
terest of Great Britain in the matter It
was deemed expedient to pay the Spanish
price of $100,000.

The fire started at S.-05 o'clock p. m. In
the premises of M. Ssute & Sons, whole
sale clothiers, at Lemoine and St. Peter
streets. The streets In the locality were
deserted at the time and the fire apparent
ly had good headway before the first
alarm was sent In. The firemen found the
i building, a three-story stone structure, a
mass of flames. The flames soon leaped
across St. Peter street, which Is very
narrow at this point, and attacked the big
five-story stone building occupied by H
[ A. Nelson & Sons Company, dealers in
; fancy goods. Here it spread as rapidly
[ as it had In the Saxe building. In almost
Â¦ an Instant It seemed as if the entire build
i ing was a roaring furnace.
The warehouse of Beanlmore & Co., the '
l tanners, adjoining Nelson's to the south, f
: was next attacked and from there the i
i flames comunicated to the establishment
} of Silverman, Bolton & Co.. wholesale
' hatters and furriers. Here another In
| flammable stock added to the fierceness of
I the fiames.
In the meantime the Barnes had con-
I tinued down St. Peter street on the side
of which the fire started to St. Paul
street, licking up th* premises of J. Bour
deau & Co.. Jobbers In hats and caps. St.
Peter street for an entire block was a
mass of, flames on either side. During
MONTREAL. Jan. 2-J-One of the most
destructive fires from which this city has
ever suffered began at S o'clock last night
and. notwithstanding the efforts of the en
tire fire department, che progress of the
flames was not checked until 1 o'clock
this morning. By that time It had de
stroyed property valued at between $2,500,
000 and $3,000,030 and was still burning,
though the appearance was that the fire
men had at last *rot it under control.
Included in the property burned is the
splendid Beard of Trade building? which
cost $500,000 and housed more than a hun
dred tenants, and a half dozen large busi
ness houses ar.i two .scores of small con
cercs. Outside of the Board of Trad
buildir.g there was not a modern struc
ture anior.j those burned.
The narrow streets. antlQuated build
ings and the innammable nature of the
stocks they contained made a combination
which the" department was powerless to
overcome. Moreover, the cold weather
gre&tiv hampered the firemen.
The Sre practically burned until it came
to open space, which gave the firemen an
opportunity for effective worlc For a time
it looked as if the flames would spread
alcng Commissioner street to the Urand
cÂ£ce building, in the course of erection
there. Crowds of people jammed the nar
row streets and the police could not con
trol them. Women fainted and their
clothes were torn, a few women bein?
slightly injured In rushes for safety. Fol
lowing are the estimates of the principal
losses:

this time a great fight was being made
to 8ave the big Board of Trade building,
erected ei^ht years ago at a cost of JSOO.-
C00 and adjoining the Xelaon building on
the north. For a long time the efforts of
the brigade were successful, a plentiful
supply of water keeping the exposed por
tions cooL But the flames had extended
all along the north side of St. Paul street.
going west from Sliverman, Bolton &
Co.'s, licking up half a dozen concerns In
Ita way. until It reached the big wholesale
fur establishment of James Coristine &
Co. This building extended all the. way
from St. Paul street to the Board of Trade
building and the flames appeared to go
through it like a tinder box.
When the rear wall of this building- was
reached It was seen that the Board of
Trade would have to go too. Solid sheets
of Same sprang out and up and seized
hold of the big building In a dozen dif
ferent places, driving the firemen back.
The newer and more modern structure
burned more ?lowly than those which al
ready had fallen prey to the flames, but
the firemen could not stay the march of
the devouring .element.
From the north s!de of St. Paul
street the flames leaped across the street
and destroyed the premises of Thomas
L>avidson & Co.. the dry goods establish
ment of H. Levy and half a dozen other
smaller concerns.
On Lemoine street the extensive whole
sale grocery store of Laporte, Martin &
Co. took fire. After the firemen had aban
doned all hope of saving the Board of
Trade building they concentrated their
efforts mainly on this building, for the
spread of the flames In this district would
have meant the loss of the entire whole
sale dry goods section. At 12:30 it looked
as If the building might be saved.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â Consideration
of the shipping bill was resumed this af
ternoon in the Senate. At the Instance of
Frye of Maine., who relinquished the f*>iÂ»\t
temporarily to take charge of the meas
ure on the fioor. it was made the unfinish
ed business of tfce Senate, thus restoring
It to it3 privileged position.
Vest of 'Missouri took the fioor Imme
diately and made a brilliant, forceful and
nteresting speech that occupied nearly
three hours. He advocated free ships and
vigorously attacked the navigation laws
of the United States, holding that they
were responsible for the decauencs of the
merchant marine of America. He was
accorded close attention by hid colleagues
on both sides of the chamber.
Early in the session Hawiina (D.) of Utah
precipitated a lively colloquy by charging
that a deal had been entered into between
the Republican members of the Utah Leg
islature and certain railroad interejts and
the oincials of the Mormon church to se
cure the election of Thomas Kearns to
the Senate from that State. He aroused
Hale of ilaine and Changer of New

STRONGLY FAVORS
SUBSIDY BILL
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â The House to
day passed the District of Columbia ap
propriation bill and entered upon consid
eration of the naval -appropriation bill.
Several provisions of the bill were defeat
ed on points of order, including that to
give warrant officers the commutation for
quarters allowed second lieutenants of the
marine corps. A point of order was sus
tained against an amendment to Increase
the number of chaplains in the navy from
twenty-four to thirty-four.
Alter the passage of the District of Co
lumbia appropriation bill the Senate res
olution for the celebration cf John Mar
shall cay, February -4, was adopted.
The House then took up the na.vai ap
propriation bill. Foss of Illinois, chair
man of the Naval Committee, explained
its salient features. Ke said that the
American navy Â¦was larger than the Ger
man navy and was keeping a. little ahead
of It. Grosvenor cf Ohio said he consid
ered this remark unfortunate. and capable
of misconstruction. America, he said,
was friendly with Germany, and there
was no reason why tnat ; country should
be singled out for the purpose of compar
ison. Foss disclaimed any idea thkt the
Government was directing its energies to
ward keeping ahead of Germany. He had
simply stated a fact. He believed in a
strong and efficient navy, not so large as
England's, but of moderate size, built on
conservative lines and capable of uphold
ing the honor of the country and the flag.
Richardson of Tennessee, the minority
leader, called attention to the fact that
the bill "carries an Increase of ?12.0U),000
In time of profound peace."
"This bill carries Jj,Cm),C%'0 for carrying
on work previously authorized," Inter
posed Dayton of West Virginia, "and $3.
tuO.toO for rehabilitation of the naval acad
emy." ~
* J rhat may be," answered Richardson,
"bet last year the bill carried 513,00O,0&)
more than the bill for the previous year.
Last year the size of the bill was apolo
gized for. What I desire to emphasize Is
that year by year there come these great
increases for the navy. The present bill
Is J20.ttO.OOii larger than the bill of two
years ago."
After completing five pages of the stx
ty-elffht of the bill the House at 5:10 ad
journed. .Â¦ -A

An overworked nervous system ia always an exhausted 'nerv.
otis system, rhe body is robbed of -its vital forces, the nutritive
organs suffer for lack of control The supply of blood and the
action of the heart are seriously disturbed. Sick headaches, dull
pains in back of neck and down the spine, dizziness ringing in the
ears, dimness of vision, twitching of eye lids and eye muscles and
a general tired feeling tell of the failing strength. There is nerr-
o^isness, irritability, wakefulness, loss of memory, brain fag and
depression of spirits. A remedy for nervous -debility should begin
at the foundation of the trouble; and, by checking the unnatural
waste of nerve-force and stimulating the digestive organs, build
cp the vitality and resistive strength of the whole system.

B- â EST of all the English riders.
Sammy L.oates, was a keen ob
server of racing at Tanforan
__ Park yesterday as conducted in
this far western country. A
cautious chap Is this jockey from the
other side, speaking in quarter sections,
as if his innermost thoughts were re
tained for airing at some distant time.
On the ground also was Lester Relff, who
crossed the pond and led all of the riders,
English and American alike, by his bril
liant work in the saddle. Upon his re
turn home Loates will probably have a
good joke to relate about Reiff. for, i;i
an evil moment. Lester agreed to accept
the mount on Slap Dash in the final six
and a half furlong sprint. The American
rider received an ovation as he Issueu
from the paddock on the back of "Boots
Durnell's gelding. At the start Rasp, a
100 to 1 shot, swerved, and Relrt was
compelled to take up his mount to a
standstill. By this time the bunch had
slipped away, and Slap Dash was target
bearer. Mounce on Maresa went on and
won from Phil Archibald, a 15 to 1 shot.
Nash Turner had the leg up on Edna
Brown, a 7 to 10 favorite for the race,
finishing unplaced.
The track was still In a very muddy
state, and first choices at the San
Mateo County track took but two
purses. The card- was far better than the
average, attracting a large crowd.
Ordnung, the trained horse from tha
Schorr stable, defeated a fast band of
sprinters for the Coney Island handicap,
at six furlongs. Carrying 115 pounds, and
extensively played at 4Â£ to. 1. the chest
nut gelding made a show of the com'
pany? winning galloping from Scotch
Plaid and Rolling Boer.
The races run by Ordnung haye slmplj
been disgusting and disgraceful, and on
anv foreign race course would have con-
SlgUd ? his owner to exile and oblivion
On Saturday, at Oakland, Ordnung ran
like a common car hor B e in the race won
by BUI Garrett. If the Indiscretions of
a wealthy owner are to be overlooked by
officials the country over, because this
turfman may make liberal nominations to
many stakes, then poor owners should not
ho rnked over the coals for indifferent
Slrfo a rrnan C O e 9 er of cheap selling platers It
Vould be interesting reading to many to
know with what disease Ordnung wasaf
flicted when beaten last meeting a Tan
foran by Jerld and Prestidigitator. On
that occasion the gelding's odds opened
at 3 to 2 and went to 2, with Toramj
Burns in the eaddle. Jerld from the time
the entries were Issued was tou ed as a
"good thing" and was hea 7 iIj -%i ; ?-nwi
10 to 1. Neither does the ride of this same
rider Burns, astride Formero on Tues
day, reflect rnuch credit when it is known
th-it several large commissions were
Saced on Herculean through the messen
ger service. Many races have been^run
during the present season that have worn
a very rotten look, and It .behooves the
officials of both tracks to keep a watchful
Tom^Xpse at the "dope" book. It
looked as If Duckoy held his field safe In
the opening event; still 6 to 1 was laid
about the gelding. With Coburn up., he
won hands down from Tenny Belle, while
the favorite. Isaline, ran unplaced.
Pat Dunne started Nansen In the mile
selling affair for maidens. Fortunately
for -the -horse's friends, who accepted 7 to
10 about him. he was much the best. Get
ting a poor start, Henry sent the favorite
around his field and the last part was
eased up almost, to lead . out George
Dewey and Sam Howard. â,âÂ»â

Bergen for the downfall of The Lady In

Jenkins in the saddle, was simply a bet

The lonirest tunnel" In California â and
there are some pretty long ones â and one
of the largest tunnels in America is now
in rourse of construction by the Southern
Pacific Company. Although the work has
been going on for several months the im
mensity of the undertaking has never be
fore been brought to the attention of ths
public nor has there been anything more
than a casual reference made to the costly
piece of workmanshlo.
The tunnel is being dug In the Chats
worth Park cut-off and when completed
will be a part of the new coast division
between this city and Los Angeles. Th<}
cut-off is really between the towns of
Montalvo and Chatswcrth Park. The San
ta Susana range occuoles a vast field o:
spare between these two points and it is
'his great rai:ge that the tun
nel is to pa??.
The total longrth of ihe underground pas
fage will be 7100 feet, <r nearly a mife and
a half. The tunnel next largest to this
is at San Fernando, the latter being ti370
feet long. The building of this tunnel will
involve the expenditure of more than
$271,0110. The work was started last fa.l
&nd a large force of laborers is now be
ing employed both day and nlpht with a
view to completing t'lP structure this
ioar.

HONG AH WING, a Chinaman,
was a5sassir.at<*d about noon
yesterday in the kitchen on the
top floor of 26 Sullivan alley.
The Instrument used was a
knife with a Made nine and a quarter
inches lone\ which was found covered
with blood beside the dying man. George
Duffield. a collector In Chinatown, was
the first to hear of the murder. He was
r.n the corner of Jackson street and Sulli
van alley about 5 minutes past 12 o'clock,
when a Chinaman told him that a man
had rwen cut on the top floor of 26 Sulli
van alley. Duffield told the Chinaman to
roUfy the police and hurried to the place.
He found the man, whom he recognized
ap Hone Ah Wing, stretched out on the
floor. He discovered a wound In his left
*;de and tried to get him to talk, but
failed.
Policemen Connolly and McNamaxa
were on their way to Chinatown from the
Central police station when they were no
tified of the stabbing. They went to Sulli
van alley and at once telephoned for the
patrol wagon. The wounded man was
Â»-*nt to the Receiving: Hospital, but died
Wfore he could be placed on the operat
ing table. His body was then removed to
ihe Morgue, where It was foun<i that bÂ«-
Fiilos the fatal wound on the left side
there wtre two slight wounds on the left
shoulder.
T)ip murdered man and Chen Hoot K.ee,
fruit dealer. 716 Jackson street, had a fight
Tur-sday nicht in the fruit store. When
Policemen Barry and Fanner reached the
store Chen had Hong across a table and
bad a knife in his hand ready to plunge
it Into him. He was disarmed and both
(hen's friends held an indignation meet
ing in his fruit store Tuesday night and a
delegation was appointed to go to the Hall
of Justice yesterday morning and lay the
facts before the Judge. Attorney Mack
was engaged to defend Chen, and when
the caw was called in Judge Mogan's
court Mack made an explanation and the
Judge agreed to release Chen on $150 cash
bail, which was at once forthcoming.
Chen was released at ten minutes to 12
o'clock, and as the ftabbing happened a
few minutes later he was arrested at his
Ftore by Policemen Connolly and McNa
mara and locked up In the tanks" pend
ing further investigation. He denied that
he knew anything about the stabbing and
said he went direct from the Hall of Jus
tice *o his store.
Detective Ed Gibson was detailed on the
case, and after making an Investigation
he was inclined to believe that Hong had
been decoyed to the top floor of 26 Sulli
van alley and assassinated by some of
Chen's friends, although Chen had ample
time to commit the deed after being re
leased. Both of the men belonged to the
Sam Tup organization. Hong had been
fed and provided with a room for some
time by Chen, who quarreled with him
a few days ago for going home at too late
hours and refused to keen him any longer.
This "was the cause of the fight Tuesday
night. Hong had been married to an
Alaska Indian and has a son about 12
years of ape. to whose support he had not
contributed for j'ears.
were taken to the City Prison, where
Hong preferred a charge of assault to
murder against Chen and he was booked
on that charge. Chen protested and de
clared that Hong was the assailant, and
he showed two fingers on his left hand
out to the bone, which cut, he said, was
caused by his forcibly taking the knife
from Hong;.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
Cough. Cough.
Ni^ht and day, until the strength is
entirely exhausted, and that dreaded
word Â« Consumption" begins to be whis-
pered among; friends. That's a common
story, familiar to the people of erery
town and village. /
There's another story which ought to
be as widely known as the story of dis-
ease, and that is the story of the cures
effected by the use of Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery. Bronchitis, asthma,
obstinate, deep-seated coughs, bleeding
of the lungs, and other forms of disease
which affect the respiratory organs, are
permanently cured by the use of " Golden
Medical Discovery."
"Only for Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery I think I would be in my grave to-day,"
writes Mr. Moses Miles, of HilHard, Ulnta Co..
Wyoming-. "I had asthma so bad I could not
sleep at nisrtit and was compelled to gire up
wort. It aflfected my lungs so that I coughed'
all the time, .both night and day. My fnends
all thought I had consumption. My wife in-
sisted on my trying Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery â wrlich I did. I have taken four
bottles and am now a well man, weighing 185
pounds, thanks to Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery."

Palmer when - that < ship was in collision
with the Empress of Japan seven weeks

contention Just now between the rival

of Japan, but he has so far refused to
cross the international boundary line and
have any sort of conference with the
American owners of the Palmer. .
After Muller Jumped aboard the Em

to Japan. He. made several affidavits and
informed United States Consul Dudley to
day, that he had seen and reported tho

the collision. At Hongkong Muller is said
to have wished to return, while the offi

off. ' Muller then affected the bluff that
statements heMiad sworn to were untrue
and that he would como back to the in

after much wrangling, Muller was brought
back. He hag made a claim through Con

Aged Couple Tell a Pitiful
Story in Court at
San Jose. -
The land was bought by all, each con
tributing a pro rata of the sum. It was
agreed that the land should be held and
used for the benefit of all. . In 'further
ance of the purposes two companies â the
Sacramento Land and Development Con** â¢
pany and the Sacramento Oil Company
were organized and forty acres of land
were conveyed to the Sacramento Oil
Company and the remaining one-twen
tieth to the Sacramento Oil and Develop
ment Company. It is alleged that the
partners held all the stockâ 9000 sharesâ
of the Sacramento Oil and Development
Company and 36,000 shares out of the 50,000
in the Sacramento Oil Company, the re
maining 14,000 in the latter being held by
the company for sale in order to develop
the property. Carmichael was selected at
Clark's request as manager and secretary
and had supervision of the work of boring
for oil. â¢

Sesnon and Carmichael concealed from
Clark all knowledge of the true situation,

The complaint alleges that Clark, Ses
non and Samuel in the summer of 1S99
entered into an arrangement to purchase
oil lands, and shortly thereafter tound lt>0
acres In Kern County belonging to the
Berry Oil and Development Company
which could be purchased for $2400. ' An
agreement was mode to purchase the- land
at that price and Clark paid $500 on ac
count. It was then determined to take
in other persons. Accordingly Carmich
ael, Wright, Knowles, Gillis and Porter
associated themselves with Clark, Sesnon
and Samuel.
A suit making allegations identical with
those of Clark was also filed this after
noon by A. P. Booth, business partner of
Clark. Judge Hughes at once issued tem
porary restraining orders as prayed for
and directed the defendants to appear in
his court .February b and show cause why
the order should not be made permanent.
J. B. Wright, one of the defendants, is
superintendent of the Sacramento division
of the Southern Pacific; J. L. Gillis, an
other defendant, is State Librarian; D.
W. Carmichael, another defendant, was
formerly Treasurer of Sacramento and Is
a leading Democratic politician; W. T.
Sesnon, another defendant, was formerly
County Clerk of San Francisco, and at
present is secretary of the Railroad Com
missioners; B. F. Porter, another defend
ant, is the father-in-law of Sesnoo, and a
wealthy resident of Santa Cruz 'County,
while W. E. Knowles and A. J. Samuel
are oil-land dealers at Bakersfield.

White said he would advance the money
needed by Shirley and he did not care
whether it was ever . paid back or not.
The only thing he asked was that Shirley
make a- trust deed of his property to him
to show his gratitude. This Shirley agreed
to do, but after the instrument had been
made he learned that he had given White
an absolute deed instead of a trust deed.
After this White sent Shirley 51 and for
ty shares of the Red Rock 'Mining Com
pany, which -he claimed were worth *40 -
000. Shirley found the stock was worth
less, and when he accused White the lat

On October 31, 1900, the Sacramento Land
and Development Company conveyed '.to
Knowles seventeen acres and a fraction
of the 120 "acres and at the same Â¦ time
deeded to 'Wright, Gillis and Carmichael
fifty-two acres and to Samuel the same
number conveyed to Knowles. ClarK
charges that such deeds' were -given- in
consideration of the surrender to the com
pany by â¢ the grantees o"f the stock that
they held and that the deeds were made
to hinder and obstruct- him in the'recov
ery of his stock. Finally plaintifCideclarea
that since he gave. up his stock to Car
michael and Sesnon the Â¦ Sacramento Oil
Company, which owns the forty acres
where oil was struck, had taken â¢ out at
least 60,000 barrels of oil; that .such land
is now producing and will continue to
produce large quantities of oil; that de
fendants had on hand several thousand
barrels and- that they .will dispose of It
unless the court intervenes. Clark and
Booth ask that they be fully reinstated
as ; stockholders, afhrming their willing
ness to pay back the money given thÂ»>m
by the seven defendants, and they also
ask that the court restrain the defendants
from disposing' of the stock in such a
way was to shut them out of their. rights.
On January 13, 1900, Carmichael and Ses
non brought to Clark and Booth $3554 45.
representing that the land had been sold
for $100 per acre and that the money thus
paid Clark and Booth was their shareâ
two-ninthsâ of the purchase price. -*
Â¦ Clark further charges that the sale was
a mere pretense and a fraud; that no sale
had ever been contemplated;, that none of
the parties. had intended to sen. or desired
to do so and that no negotiations were
ever pending for a sale. Plaintiff alleges
that the forty acres of land belonging to
the Sacramento Oil Company upon which
oil had been struck were then' worth $200,
000, and the remaining 120 acres belonging
to the Sacramento Land and Development
Company were worth $480,000. Clark
further alleges that after he delivered his
stock to Carmichael and Sesnon It was
divided among the seven defendants and
that the money paid to him was furnished
by them.
Clark alleages that on January 10, 1900,
three days after the discovery of oil, Car
michael and Sesnon, knowing that oil had
been struck, and Wright; Gillis and other
defendants, also having notice of the" dis
covery, went to Clark and A. P. Booth
and represented that a purchaser had
been found for the land for $100 per acre,
and that a sale had better be made at
once, for there was no prospect of dis
covering oil, and all parties had agreed
to sell for that figure, and were In fact
about to do so.
Thereupon, plaintiff says, he indorsed
his certificates of stock and delivered the
same to Carmichael, but plaintiff states
that the representations made to him
were false and were made for the purpose
of defrauding him; that all the defendants
knew that the land was valuable and all
acted together in the effort to obtain for
themselves the stock of Clark and Booth.
time, the complaint avers, Carmichael had
reported to Clark: that the land was of
but little value, and did not contain oil,
and that there was no hope of finding any,
but that because of the discovery of oil
In Kern County a few months before, and
in consequence of the demand thus cre
ated for land, it might be possible for the
parties to sell the land at $100 per acre,
and that a sale ought to be made at thai
price, as no greater could be obtained.

TOPBICA. Kans., Jan. 23.â A. Capital
special from Enterprise, â¢ Kans., says:-
Mrs. Carrie Nation, wiso gained notoriety
by debtroylng saloon fixtures -in Wichita,
began her crusade in Enterprise to-day by
demolishing one saloon and delivering a
street lecture. Sh6 arrived on the early
morningv Santa' Fe train" from Wichita and '
went at once to the home of C. Bi Holt- j
man, the well-known Populist leader. Mr. i
HofEman was away, '"out his wife was at
home and a temperance meeting was held
at the house at 2 o'clock, attended by a.
dozen or more women.
After-^crfecclng plans Mrs. : Nation se
cured a hatchet ajid started for the busi
ness parti of town, accompanied by Mr3.
Hoffman.' Mrs. L.. A. Case, a leadine \V.
C. T. u. worker, ami another woman,
who was veiled. '
Mrs. Nation went to Schilling's place,
which was locked, and attacked the glar.3
doors. She smashed the, glass out of the
frames and stepped into the deserted
saloon, leaving the others outside. Sha
smashed the big mirror, chopped gashes
In the bar and broke 'all the glasses and
bottles on the shelves. Then she went to
the refrigerator a*nd commenced taking
out cases of beer. She handled them
easily and, lifting th<*m high in the air,
dropped them on the fioor, deftly crack
ing each bottle left solid after the fall.
The floor was soon covered with 'a mix
ture of drinkables. 1 '. Â¦-' But she kept up the
work until . Marshal/ VV. R. Benham en
tered and, raiting her by the sleeve, told
her she must get out.
"What are you," she. demanded, "but a
murderer and perjurer In protecting this
unholy traffic? Either let me alone or take
off your star.'*
But she followed him out and, calling
her companions, proceeded to give the
Marshal a blistering arraignment in the
presence of the crowd. She then started
for the other saloon, but It was well barri
caded and offered no "plate glass for her
to attack.
The Marshal refused to allow her to
chop down the doors and she finally went
home with her companions. She said sh*
had only begun her, work and expected
to clean out many rpore places. It is re
ported she will move ori Abilene to-mor
row and the Abilene saloon-keepers are
preparing for her coming. . <
About 8:30 o'clock, as Mrs. Nation was
lecturing on the streets, Mrs. Schilling;
the wife of the saloon-keeper, whose place
of business was demolished, approached
her. '
"I've got you now," she said, and struck
Mrs. Nation twice in the face. A slight
gash was cut over the eye and it bled pro
fusely, i Mrs. -Nation went to a neighbor
ing house and had her eye bandaged and
continued her lecture on the street. The
crowd was too noisy and she soon ad
journed to a church near by, where she
made a long: address. (
TOPBKA, Kans., Jan. 23.â Mrs. T. M.
Hutchlnson. State president of the
Woman's Christian .Temperance Union,
says that the organization is not in favor
of the tactics employed by Mrs. Nation
in her warfare against the saloons. She
says: . - _ . ' â¢ .
"Loyalty to Mrs. Nation demands that
we procure for her a fair trial, but we do
not favor her methods. - All our interest
In her raJd Is to find out whether the
property of the saloon-keepers can be
protected under the law. It is the general
opinion that no such a thing as . justice
can be obtained in Wichita courts on the
temperance question.".

_It is hardly necessaiy -to say the women were
pleased. A carriage t ide is not to , be had every day
by every woman, in Kansas. They thought the custpm
was a necessary part of voting and were very glad that
suffrage had. come to them. When the' next election;
came along they dressed themselves for a drive: and
waited ''for the carriage to , come. , It came. Sines
then at each succeeding election the Kansas candidate
has known .'that â¢ he'* must* provide > carriages for- the
dames or be snowed under, j ; carriages 'cost
something. The Kansas politicians began bleeding
at every pore. They came; to the conclusion that
something must be done. ; Hence^ the bill to put -an
end ' to womanhood suffrage. It is a measure^ in : the
interests of economy, .retrenchment and reform.
TZZJ ROM Kansas comes the report that a bill has
I been introduced into the Legislature designed
"' to deprive the women of the commonwealth of
the right of suffrage. The experience of the State
with '.woman's fashion of voting has not been long,
but it is said to have been amply sufficient to satisfy
the men:: The voters have rid the State of Populism,
and now they, wish to get back to straight, old
fashioned politics, where the privilege of
votes and whooping it up for candidates belongs ex
clusively to men.
Several grievances are urged against the Kansas
woman as a voter, but the one which appears most
serious is that. of. the cost which ,her planner of doing
politics imposes upon candidates. It appears that the
first campaign in which women took part was one of
unusual excitement even for Kansas. ; There was, a
big demand for votes in every district. Consequently
the party managers on both sides determined to
make a bid for, the votes of. the women by treating
them with distinguished gallantry. In almost every

The first census, in 1790, located the center of popu
lation about thirty miles east of Baltimore. In 1800
it was eighteen miles west of Baltimore. By 1810
ir had moved thirty-six miles farther westward, with
a slight deflection south, and was forty miles north
west of Washington City. In 1820 the center was
fifty miles farther west, with .a still stronger deflection
southward, and was sixteen miles north of Wood
stock, Va. In 1830 the center had moved thirty-niue
miles southwest arid was at MoorefTeld, Ya., now West
Virginia. In 1840 immigration to the Mississippi
Valley pulled the point fifty miles farther west and
reduced the southern curve; 1850 found it fifty miles
advanced westerly, with the southern curve .restored,
and located it at Parkersburg, Va., now also in West.
Virginia. In i860 the center had crossed Mason and
Dixon's line, and, advancing westward eighty-one
miles, was within twenty miles of Chillicothe, Ohio.
In 1870 the advance had been forty-two miles, with
a strong deflectidn northwesterly, to a point forty
; eight miles northeast of Cincinnati. In 1880 it. had
I advanced west fifty-eight miles, with a slight south
ern deflection, and in 1890 it was'still in Ohio ; with
a turn north again, and had advanced forty-eight
miles. Â» Â¦-.
The center has moved westwardly since 1790 a dis
tance of 505 miles, with slight deflections north and
south.
" Columbifs, Ind., near the present center, is a large
and important manufacturing city, surrounded by; a
rich farming country and near enough the natural
gas belt to use gas for manufacturing fuel. There is ;
located the largest tannery in the world, which draws
on California for its t>upply of oak tan bark.
BY the superior organization of the Census
Bureau the population statistics are available
for analysis much earlier than heretofore. Bj
the census 'of 1890 the center of population was a
little west of Columbus, Ohio. By the census of 1900
this center has moved westward and is near the town
of Columbus, in Bartholomew County, Indiana.
The coincidence in the name of the two centers is
rot without interest. The name of the Genoese dis
coverer of this new world is perpetuated by towns
in Missouri and Iowa, and it will hot be strange if the
moving center of population in its march westward
is found ten years hence to be near one of them.
Th|E CENTER OF POPULATION
Some of the newer land States are acting more
wisely, admonished by the sore experience of their
ciders. Colorado" has a large area of land granted in
lieu of the school sections included in Indian and
reservations, and is leasing it for grazing pur
poses. The leasehold control increases its value by
preserving its moisture, and if the sources of water
trpply are not destroyed by grazing sheep in the
forest reservations tlvs land will by and by produce
more for the support of the schools than all the rest
of school sections which have been sold.
It can now only be regretted that the expansion and
the needs of the institution were not foreseen and
its infancy supported by the leasing of its lands. Â»
If the eighty-two sections of land had been leased
and held in university ownership, to be sold when
their value reached its most favorable point, the an
nual income from that source alone would now" be
$524,800. The proceeds of the land scrip and the
State fund, added to this, would have made the insti
tution independent of taxation.
The Political Code recites that the endowment of
the university is the proceeds of the sale of seventy
two sections of land granted to the State for a semin
ary of learning; the proceeds of ten sections of land
granted the State for public buildings', the income
derived from the 'investment of the proceeds of the
s-ale of the lands, or the scrip therefor, or any part
thereof, granted to this State for the benefit of agri
culture and the mechanic arts; the income of the
fi'nd set apart by an "act for the endowment of the
University of California."
It appears from the university report that the in
come from all these sources is only $135,000, while
the needs of the institution require now at least $510,
000 annually. It will be seen that the endowment
intended' to suffice for^ its permanent support falls
short $375,000 per annum, and that sum must be sup
plied by some form of taxation.
In every case, however, the school sections have
been sold at only a slight advance on the Government
price, and the fund produced has proved so inadequate
that burdensome taxation is resorted to for the sup
port of the schools. Had the public land States re
sorted to leasing the school sections the revenue
would have supported the schools in their develop
mental period, and when the lands were made valuable
by the presence of a dense population their sale woull
have produced sufficient capital to maintain the
schools without taxat^pn. 'By the unwise policy cf
immediate sale this increment of value has been the
profit of individuals, and the schools would all close
if they were to depend upon the income of an endow
ment which was intended to suffice for their entire an 1
I ermanent support. The matter is of present interest
ii; view of the plight 01 our State University. It had
a public land endowment of eighty-two sections.
This latter provision is credited to Mr. Jefferson,
and it was obviously intended that the school lands
should be so managed as to support common school
education without resorting to taxation.
THE proposition of the cattle men to lease such
parts of the public domain as are more valuable
for grazing than any other purpose brings up
the question of the waste of the landed endowment
of schools and universities in the public land States.
The landed endowment of education began in the or
dinance of 1787, by which Virginia ceded her North
west Territory to the Union on condition that slave
holding should not be permitted thereon, and that
land should be set aside for the permanent suppor:
of free, common school education.

STATE PRESS COMMENT

THE CARTOONIST ONJHB ST. PAUL. PIONEER PRESS MUST HAVE
BEEN (JUNNING FOR THE REAL. 'THING WHEN HE GOT THIS ZE
, ROICAL SPECIMEN.
It is to be borne in mind tjiat at this juncture we
can never advertise California too much nor too often.
Our State, is still undeveloped. We need a large**
population and a greater variety ,of industries.
Furthermore we need more commerce. Out of th*
two expositions of the year we may gain something
of all those things, and it is worth while" to make a
united effort to do so.
The exposition at Charleston, which is to follow
that at Buffalo, is of not so great importance to us,
but still it will be worth our while to take part in it.
The object of that enterprise is to promote trade with
the West Indies, a matter with which we have com
paratively little concern. The South;. however, is a
rapidly advancing section of the Union. The people
there are increasing in wealth and ought to become
targe consumers of California fruits and wines. . More
over it is a section which just at^this time is doing
its uttermost to attract settlers from the North. Ar
rangements have been made to grant special induce
ments .to people from the Northern States to .visit
Charleston during the exposition and see the South.
Should California have there a notably strong dis
play- of her products and' her resources, we migh:
be able to direct to this State a considerable number
of the Northern visitors who otherwise would decide
upon making homes in the South without giving a
thought to California.
It is well known that we do. not obtain anything
like as large a proportion of the commerce of South
America 'as we should. It was one? of the aims of
the far-reaching statesmanship of'Janies G. Blaine to
establish reciprocal trade between : ourselves and the
continent to the south" of us, and in that way not only
provide a material benefit for all, concerned but bring
about closer political affiliation, so that our influence
might be helpful in improving South American con
ditions and thus" preparing the way for enlarged in
dustries'and an enlarged market among the South
American peoples for our. products. The vicissitudes
of politics prevented him from carrying out his great
plans during his life; but inthis respect his work lives
after him, and the Buffalo Exposition is going to Be
aii important" step toward accomplishing what he
desired. , Â»/"
It is now certain the Buffalo enterprise is to ; be an
exposition of the industries of all the Americas â South
ern and Central, as well as Northern. It is to afford
the peoples*of the three grand divisions of this hemi
sphere an opportunity for studying the needs of one
another and the extent to which those needs can he
supplied by an interchange of products.

WHILE the work of preparing a display of the
industries and Uie resources of California at the
Pan- American" Exposition at Buffalo is in good
hands, the efforts of those in charge^ should tfe cor
dially promoted and assisted. . The interests of the
whole StJte, are to be advanced by a proper demon
stration-of their value in competition witiuBther
American States, and consequently all citizens should,
in proportion to their ability; contribute toward the
success of what is being' done. to make that demon
stration.
Our whole Indian policy is a tangle and labyrinth
of wrong and injustice, and it is too much to expert
that it will ever be made straight; but the country
should pause before it proceeds to the slaughter of
the five civilized tribes for the offense of insisting
upon the rights they retained A by treaty.
- As this- country has paid Indians for their lands,
the sums paid have been carried in the Federal treas :
ury as trust funds. These trust funds now amount to
$33*315,955 09. Once at least these funds were raided
and robbed by public officers, and we are not "aware
that the Government as trustee ever made the loss
good. '
The Indian Commissioner reports that Indian
ownership of these funds is harmful to the tribe j
and proposes that they be gradually exhausted by
devoting them to the education of the Indians! This,
we believe, would be a distinct violation of the treaty
rights of the Igdians. They sold their lands for that
money, and'it is theirs. To dispose of itjvithout con
sulting their wishes, under pretense of giving to then;
an education which is of no value to them/ is to vio
late their rights.
It would seem that the laws and courts of this coun
try should afford ample support to the treaty rights
of these Indians, and that it should not be necessary
to add another chapter to the history of our century
of dishonor in dealing with the red men. '
Behind it all is a political movement in the interest
ct the Territory of Oklahoma. That Territory is quite
arid, and its resources are believed to be incapable of
supporting a State government -The Oklahoma plan
is to eject the Indians from the Indian Territory, by
nagging them into armed resistance, and then seize
their territory, annex it ,to Oklahoma and admit the
whole as a State. The Indians, who are educated and
intelligent, are perfectly, aware of this conspiracy
against their rights and seem about to make the mis
take of armed resistance, which is just what their ene
mies desire them to. do.
THE Indians of Indian Territory, are showing
uneasiness, and, under Chief "Mekko, are taking
an attitude hostile to the whites. The five civil
ized tribes in the Territory, the Creeks, Cherokee*.
Choctaws, Chickasaws and Seminoles, have for some
time complained, and with a color of justification,
that the Government does not observe its treaties
with them. They have made overtures for an. arrange
ment with Mexico whereby they might acquire lands
in that republic and settle, to live, as they say, "under
a Government that keeys its word.".
These tribes formerly derived large revenues from
leasing their lands for tattle grazing. This has iieen
prohibited by the Government and the prohibition is
regarded as a violation of their rights. The Territory
is a fertile section, well covered with forest, and was
given the five tribes in lieuof their lands east of the
Mississippi River. At the time this exchange of lands,
was made it was intended that the Indians should be
ai. independent in the occupation and control of their
land as were .the"\vhite3 on the lands they exchanged.
Not only was this the intention, but it is .claimed as
an express part of the treaty. But the Indian Com
missioner at Washington assumes the right to dis
approve of the grazing leases and to deprive the In
dians of the resulting revenue.

Cigarette Habit Declining.
Trade reports indicate a decline In. the
cigarette habit. In four years the an
nual output in the United States is said
to have fallen off nearly one-fourth. It
is probable that other elements enter into
this decreased manufacture besides a di
minished consumption. For example, many
confirmed smokers roll their own cigar
ettes. Nevertheless the general state
ment accords with observation. The cig
arette is not so conspicuous an offense as
it was a few years ago. This is a healthy
sign. Certain diseases pass over the com
munity from time to time, certain vices,
habits, fashions, or whatever they may
be called, thÂ«t do a great deal of moral
*ind physical harm. The epidemic will
rage for a few years and then abate, j The
vice is not eradicated but it ceases to. be
threatening. Cigarette smoking, as it pre
vailed in the later years of the past cen

MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY AND LAY DELEGATES OF THE EPISCO
PAL CHURCH OF THE DIOCESE OF CALIFORNIA WHO TOOK PART
IX CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS YESTERDAY.
~. a - :CLEROTMAN dramatically tVlW
y\ " Ing of his poverty and a layman
J=*=\ advising the clerygmen how to
A iX carry out part of their duties were
the Important and rather startling
features of yesterday's work of the con
vention of the Episcopal Diocese of Cali
fornia at Grace Church.
The wearer of the minister's garb who
told of his humble surroundings was Rev.
Herbert P,arrish of the Church of the Ad
vent and the layman who undertook to
advise the clergymen -how to perform part
of their duties was Major W. B. Hooper
of the Occidental Hotel, who Is a lay dele
gate to the convention.
Both the confession of poverty and the
advice to the clergy were called 'forth
by the discussion which followed the re
port of the Diocesan Board of Missions
and the appeal for $S00O to carry on the
work of the board. The v report was pre
sented at the morning session of*ihe con
vention, and while certain parishes re
ceived praise for the past year's records,
all were called upon to contribute an
equal share to the money needed for mis
sion work for the coming year.
Rev. Herbert Parrish caused a sensa
tion by declaring that it would be impos
sible for his parish to furnish its quota
of the money needed.
"It is hard enough for me to keep my
church open," he said, "and as for bear
ing- our quota of the sum needed by the
mission board, it will be impossible. Â¦- %
live in a cellar beneath my church and I
do not know but any day I may have to
go forth to beg my daily bread."
These startling words, spoken in the
magnificent edltice of Grace -Church, in
the presence of men representing some of
the richest congregations in the State,
created a sensation. Sympathy for -the
young clergyman v.-as freely ex
pressed on all sides, the Rev. Air. Wilson,
secretary Â°' tn e convention, leaving his
seat at the chancel rail and putting his
arms affectionately around the heck of
the Rev. Mr. Parrish. Bishop Nichols
thanked the Rev. Mr. Parrish for his re
marks and paid that there was no need to
rattle the bones of a skeleton.
Major Hooper, In discussing the repTort
of the board of missions, eaid that he had
a tender spot in his heart for the work of
the board. Continuing, Major Hooper
said:
"The results achieved by the board are
creditable to all concerned. We all re
member the opposition to the creation of
the office of archdeacon and the incum
bent. The Master has surely aided in the
good work, but. la that work to stop?
You clergymen must educate the people
in this regard. Your tactics must ' be
changed. Don't depend too much on
preaching to raise funds. The mental
diet requires change. None of us can
carry our means away with us. High and
low, rich and poor are laid low by. the
Master. If you clergymen will approach
the laity in the right way you will have
no difficulty in raising the required funds
for mission work. I am not delivering a
! sermon. I am only giving you a layman's
advice." * . . "
â¢ Rev. E: I>- PAiTons of San Mateo *poke
of the jealousies existing, among the
clergy as being detrimental to mission
work. The clergyman, . he said, thinks
more of the name of his church than he
does of the eouls around him awaiting
salvation. The board of missions is ham-,
pered by narrow-mindedness and limited
In Its scope by the boundary of the par
ish. Every clergyman, he added, must
work not for his parish alone but for the
entire church, and all petty jealousy must
cease.
Rev. : Burr M. Wecden of San Jose
quoted figures to show that the rich par
ishes of the diocese were not bearing their
share of the expense of the board of mis
sions. Nearly *^>X> had been paid in taxes
on church property in the diocese and
$5617 contributed to the board of missions.
Thirteen parishes had paid of this amount
$2900 in taxes and had only contributed
$2151 to the mission, board. The board
asked for $8000 and he hoped that ten rec
tors would pledge themselves to bear a
full share of the assessment. He would
pledge himself that his parish would -pay
Us full- quota of the, money required by
the board of missions.
Rev. F. W/ Clampfctt followed In the
same strain as the previous speaker and
said ' that wealthy parishes Â¦" should pay
more than their quota of the money re
quired. The poor parishes could not be
expected to carry on their mission work
without the aid of tha. wealthy parishes.*
He pledged his church to subscribe' )1000
toward: the $8000 and if one parVÂ»hcould
do this the others In the diocese shoul-1
be able to raise more than the required
sum.
An enthusiastic scene followed the
pledges made by Rev. Mr. Weeden and
Rev.: Mr. Clampett. From all parts of the
church clergymen arose and , pledged
themselves to raise .- the - money required.
The clergymen and^parlshes which prom
ised to raise the $$000 were J. T. Bryan of
Oakland; Stockton parish; Trinity Church,
Oakland; St. Matthew's Church. San Ma
teo: Grace Church, San Francisco: -St.
Stephen's Church. San Francisco; Trinity
Church, Menlo Park."-
The business transacted yesterday i waÂ»
as' follows: Presentation and reception of
certificates of lay delegates: report of the
registrar., of. the diocese: report of Â» tha
committee on incorporated parishes and
organized missions; report of the commit
tee on Christian education. with a recom
mendation that' it be spread as much as
possible in schools and colleges; report of
the committee on church charities; report
of the . committee on the ' Btate of the
church. .
A. N. Drown : was reappolnted as chan
cellor of -the diocese -and Â¦Â¦ St. Â¦ John's
Church,; San Francisco, was selected as
the place for holding the next convention.
The salary of- the archdeacon was raised
from $1500 to $1800 per year. The deans Â«.f
the various congregations reported on the
conditions of: their- districts, the dean of
San Joaquin stating -that the dissolution
of .his district must occur through want
of funds, unless" it was merged into lhrÂ»

Kent is one of Shakespeare's noblest
men, the true picture of the hero as serv
ant.
One more name may fittingly close this
catalogue of Shakespeare's heroes, that
of a character in many ways the most
wonderful of them alL For In Prospero
Shakespeare has not only given us a pic
ture cf tha hero as philosopher and poet,
he has thereby unconsciously given us a
portrait of himself as he was at the close
of hU life. "Conscious superiority un
tinged-by arrogance, genial acorn for th-a
mean and bade, mercifulness into whlc'i
contempt entered very largely, serenity
excluding passionate affection while ad
mitting tenderness, intellect overtopping
morality. -but in no way blighting or per
verting itâ such," says Dr. Garnett, "are
the mental features of him in whose de
velopment the man of the world kept pace
with the poet, and who now shone as
the consummate perfection of both." And
these features as the dullest eye can see
are the Iineament3 of the baclshed prince,
the tender father and the great magician
whom we call Prospero. It Is not certain
that "Tfce Temnest" is the last in date
of Shakespeare's plays, but certainly it is
In spirit the most fitting conclusion to his
work, the best representative of that Ia3t
period which Dowden has so aptly bap
tized "On the Heights." From what a
mountain top of calm and lofty wisdom,
at last attained after hard toll, bitter sor
row and painful experience or the base
ness of mankind does Prospero look down
upon the world. He Is lord of the ele
ments; Ariel, the delicate spirit, and Cali
ban, the fiend-born monster, are alike bis
servants. Hia arts have made him mas
ter of men's fates: in his hand are tha
lives of the enemies who have wronged,
betrayed and robbed him. But tha only
use he makes of his power is to open their
eyes to their faults and move their heart*
to repentance. Forgiveness, reconcilia
tion, atonement, these are the words that
breathe through the harmonies of Shake
speare's latest work like the solemn mu
sle that stole alons: the airs of the en
chanted island. Over the wretchedness of
the men of sin, over the youthful inno
cence of Ferdinand and Miranda the gTeat
figure of Prospero towers like some kindly
anclent god. Yet he Is not unhuman. He.
knows the littleness of man and foresees
the comlnff end. When his work of re
conciliation 13 performed he breaks his
magic staff and drown* his book. All ni*
arts laid aside, he mingles once more with
the world of men, to rule his dukedom
wlselier than before, to see his daughter s
children springing up about his knee* ana
to brood, not in bitterness nor melancholy,
but with the grave wonder of true philos
ophers upon approaching death. *or
Prospero knows that
"-he cloud-capped towers, the gor%*yaa palaces.
The solemn temples, the great globe us*lf.
Yta, alt which It Inherit, shall dissolve.
And like the unsubstantial pageant faded
Wave net a rack" behind. We are surh iituff
A* dreams are made of, and our litfi* M:e
IÂ» rounded with a sleep.
There isjnothing real In this world, such,
seem to be Shakespeare's last words to
us, but love and forgiveness and a calm
expectance of the end.
It is a very Ions way from Theseus un
coupling bis hounds in the fairy-haunted
groves near Athens, or Falconbridge scat
tering his rough jests and plying his
ready hand, to this ripened and serene
philosopher. It indicates perhaps the dis
tance that Shakespeare had traveled from
his early admiration of the- men of action
to his final recognition of the worlds
worth. Yet bis ideals are by no mean*
Incongruous; there are certain cardinal
virtues common to almost all his heroea.
Perhaps the most striking of these Is that
Quality which gave to the poet bis nick
name of "gentle Will." Gentleness. In its
varied forma, of courtesy toward Infe
riors and equals, and of reverence toward
superiors. Is a virtue that Shakespeare
is never tired of extolling. He devotes a
whole drama to proving that the lack of
this virtue may ruin an otherwise noble
aoul. Closely akin to this quality is a
tenderness of heart, quick to respond to
an appeal for pity. Shakespeare himself
had so deep a sense of the sadness of hu
man life that he could not even Imagine
a hero devoid of this tender grace. These
qualities are - re-Â«nf orced and strength
ened in Shakespeare's heroes by the ac
tive virtues of resolution and
decision in thought and act. Shakespeare
saw nothing noble la the mere man of
eentiment, however acute or refined. HÂ»
preferred Falconbridge to Jacques. Ac
tion rather than feeling Is after all the
aim of life, and the great poet, with all
his sensitiveness and depth of emotion,
was enough of a practical man to realize
the qualities that make action possible.
The very foundation of these 13 self-con
trol â a man must master himself before
he can act on others, and in Hamlet's
praise of Horatio.
! A man that Fortune's. buffets and rewards
Hath ta'cn with equal thunlrt.
We bear the poet himself speaking his
mind on the one thing needful. Witn the
Blngle exception of Othello, all Shakes
peare's heroes are the masters of their
fate, the captains of their souls, and the
lack of self-control on Othello's part. or.
rather the loss of It under the Infernal
machinations of the deml-devil. Iago. Is.
as has been shown, responsible for the
most piteous tragedy in all Shakespeare'*
plays. Yet this self-control never passes
Into selfishness. That Is a quality re
served for the most villainous of Bhake*
peare's charactersâ Richard. Iago and
lachim~. It is well worth remark that
every hero In Shakespeare who Is domi
nated by one great aim in life sets as
his goal an object outside himselfâ Henry
V. his country's glory: Brutus, the salva
tion of the republic: Kent, the preserva
tion of his King. Finally, since of all
vices Shakespeare hated deceit most bit
terly, his t heroes are all true. Shakes
peare had little sympathy with tha
Ulysses character, the man full of wiles,
ready at need. Simplicity, sincerity, gen
uineness of thought and speech, fidelity to
a person or loyalty to as Ideal, mark all
the characters that Shakespeare deems
heroic
It is time to bring this study to a close.
A volume might easily bÂ« written on the
types of heroic character in Shakespeare's
plays and their significance as a revela
tion of the poet's mind. An almost equal
ly fertile field would be Shakespeare's
omissionsâ the .fanatic, tha martyr, tha
popular leader, the conqueror, the seeker
after truth. These omissions In their turn
testify to Shakespeare's limitationsâ *
subject left practically untouched by his
hosts of. commentators. But even In this
brief study enough has been said to show
what manner of men our greatest poet
admired, and as a consequence what man
ner of man he himself In reality was. \

HOME STUDY CIRCLE
FOR CALL READERS
A Shakespeare Evening for the Consid
eration of the Character
of Brutus.
Copyright, 1901, by Seymour Eaton.
XXV. .
(Concluded.)
Benedick, It may be said, was not put to
( the final test of heroism. But the next In
the number of Shakespeare's _ heroes Is
tried In the fiercest ; fire and proves pure
gold. It has become the fashion with
commentators nowadays to call Shakes
peare's Brutus an unpractical idealist, to
describe . him Â¦ as the man of books 'forced
by necessity into the world of action and
failing In that world; the twin-brother of
Hamlet. But this is by no means Shakes
peare's conception . of his character.
Brutus has, indeed, certain traits in com
mon with Hamlet; but he^ has one great
and distinguishing: difference, the capacity
for" reasoned and deliberate, action. He
falls, it Is true, in the task he~has under-.
taken/; 1 the restoration of republican
Rome?* Hamlet, it Is equally true, succeeds
In his. the avenging of his father's death!
But if we- look to the inner man, what -a
difference between Hamlet, ruined by the
conflicting elements of his -own nature,
and Brutus, glorified even in the hour of
his death by his unwavering .devotion to
the ideals typified In his life. The play
of "Julius Caesar" opens the great cycle
of Shakespeare's tragedies, and. in " this
period Shakespeare deals not so much
with the question of worldly success or
failure as with the inner struggle of the
soul toward victory' or defeat. And
Brutus alone of all the 'great characters
of these tragedies, Halmet, Macbeth,
Othello and the rest, comes off supreme
victor. In every point wherein his char
: acter is tested Brutus rises exalted from
the trial. He is the darling of the great
usurperâ for In the study of the play we
must regard Caesar as Shakespeare and
his age regarded himâ and a splendid
career was opened to him under Caesar's
protection. But it has no temptation for
him:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Roma
Under these hard conditions, as this time
Is like to lay upon us.
He loves Caesar, but his personal af
fection cannot for a moment stand In the
way of the common weaL The question
that agitates his mind, dispels his slum
bers, and disturbs the serenity of j h!3
temper. Is whether Caesar's death la nec
essary to the state. And when this Is
once decided, he proceeds calmly* and
steadily to action with a loftiness of tem
per that turns a murder to a sacrifice.
Brutus Is blamed for hl3 refusal to kill
Antony along with Caesar, and it is easy
to blame him after the event. But the
grounds on which Cassius urged the death
of Antony, his love for Caesar and his
power to harm the conspirators, were
from the standpoint of unselfish morality
whence Brutus viewed them weak and
even blameworthy. It Is true that he
underestimated the capacity of Antony:
men of the Brutus type are apt to despise
the gay. pleasure-loving man of genius.
But even had Brutus foreseen the dan
ger. It Is. hardly likely that he would have
acted otherwise. He loved honor more
than he feared death, and his honor was
concerned in making the slaying of Caesar
a solemn sacrifice to the republic and not
the signal for a general massacre. It
was against the- spirit of Caesar that he
fought, and had It been possible to crush
this spirit without shedding any blood, he
would have rejoiced.
Again after the death of Caesar, when
the civil wars break out and Brutus flnd3
himself at the head of an army, he is ex
posed to what is perhaps the strongest
temptation that can 'assail a man of
action, the seeming necessity of yielding
to the consequences of his own acts, and
of grasping at any means that will lead
him to his goal. It. is this necessity that
drives Macbeth step by step through a
sea of blcod. But Brutus still remains
master of himselfâ he will not stoop to
wring their hard-earned coins from
wretched peasantry or sell his office** for
gold. He punishes injustice and bribery*
even in his own ranks, and almost breaks
with his one ally because the latter is Ies3
scrupulous of ways and means than he.
Unpractical the. critics call this, too, but
even in -this life Brutus has his reward.
It is no little thing that a Roman of the
period of the civil wars should be abie to
say as his day is closing:
' Mr heart doth Joy, that yet In all my life
j I found no man but he was true to me.
It Is the common failing of such men as
Brutus, of the puritan as of the stoic, to
-be cold, reserved and self-aufflclent.
"faultily faultless." But Shakespeare -was
too warm-blooded himself to draw any
.such Icy figure of perfection. Brutus 13
human to the red ripe" of the heart, cour
teous, tender, loving. His kindliness ex
tends even to his ! slaves, over whom he
watches like a father. At the very height
of his quarrel with Cassius an appeal to
his old affection stops him in his Just re
proaches. And his relation with his wife
is the most beautiful to be found even in
Shakespjeare. Well may Anthony say of
this noblest Roman: â¢
His life was gentle: and the elements
Bo mixed in htm that nature might stand up
And say to all the world ."This was a man."
And after Brutus there is but one heroic
figure among all the - protagonists of
Shakespeare's great tragedies, but he is
the "noblest man of man's making," the
splendid soldier and pessimistic lover,
Othello. IJke the other great characters
of this tragic period, his soul is caught In
the storm of fin and driven to hopeless
ruin, i But unlike the others his eyes are
opened at the last,* he sees his fault and
the agony of his repentance forces from
him the most brokenhearted cry that ever
passed the lips of man. If one could
write an " epilogue to Othello after '^the
manner of the last act of Faust, what
other place in It could be assigned - this
"noble sinner than one among those to
whom much was forgiven because ' they
loved much? -One sees him drawn upward
to the heights by the hand of Desdemoca,
better loved and less than ever
Gretchen was by Faust. â¢
The chief feature in the character of
Othello Is his elemental simplicity. He is
so direct, so straightforward and sincere
himself that he cannot even imagine de
ceit or dishonor in his surroundings.. Bar
barian as he is by birth, he Is at heart a
very perfect, gentle knightâ brave, cour
teous,-loving, gifted with a simple but
overmastering eloquence, and cherishing
a ' spotless Ideal of honor. He Is not as
is too often supposed of a Jealous nature.
There is always something base and de
grading in this passion, and one hai bat
to compare Otbello with Shakespeare's
true Â¦ portrait of the -jealous king in "the
"Winter's Tale"; to gee how far the Moor
is ; exalted above .its meanness. . Even in
his darkest hour.lt Is not so" much jeal
ousy that feeds upon his heart and drives
him to madness and murder, as the sense
of. injured honor. .. The conflict that rages
in his soul : i Is \between passionate ', yet
reverent devotion; and a sense of utter
shame brought upon him by the ruin of
his . spotless ideals , of wedded love and
womanly, purity. In the bitterness of the
strife his self-command so hardly won
and so 'long maintained breaks down, and
the fierce barbaric temper that has once
or ; twice already shown Its . head breaks
loose, and . like the ; simoon of . his native
desert sweeps him on to the catastrophe
And over that catastrophe what other
words can be uttered than the hero's own"
"Oh.'.the pity of it," the pity, of it!"
One ; minor figure there < is in â¢ the trage
dies : whose â¢ nobleness â¢ and constancy de
mand, his Inclusion in the roll of Shake
speare's heroes, the faithful Kent of King
tear. 1 : "Even Ruskln in his sentence of ex
clusion against Shakespeare's men admits
that -Kent is -"entirely ' noble . at heart "
though : he : adds a ; condemnatory j clause
that> -'he Is too rough Â¦ and unpolished to
be of use -at the. critical time and sinks
into the office of a servant Tmly."- Wheth
er .in * the? extreme of folly; that drives
Lear on to part -bis 'kingdom, among his
daughters <â¢ a smoother-spoken ; councilor
than Kent would have prevailed with hinv
we may * well . doubt.' Certain It is that
his blunt frankness and fearless good
counsel to the overbearing and self-willed
king do him all honor. Since free speech
is forbids at court he accepts the sentence
of banishment gladly: but when evil days
draw nigh and the ; summer friends begin
to; fall away from the i old king Kent re
turns in dissruise to be bU . one * faithful

a train of very annoying, and some-

Those dreadful hot flashes, sending
I the blood surging to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint
j feeling that follows, sometimes with
chills, as if tha heart were going
stop for good, are symptoms of a dan-^
gerous, nervous trouble. Those hot
flashes are just so many calls from
nature for help. The neries are cyy-

erful speculators with ample resources, the
transaction* were 'on a large scale and the
price movement was much wider than In an
wiinary room traders' market, byt^Xhe method
of operations and thÂ« net results were much
the same. A scrutiny of the net changes for
the day will show that except in a few stocks
they are small and pretty well mixed be
tween crains and losses. Tet at one time the
whole list was at a level well o\-er yester
day's final price. The realizing movement in
tbe last hour was sufficient to wipe out al
most ail of tbe earlier advances and only the
final alight rally saved the list from a larger
showing of net losses than ls actually the
case. Buylnir by room shorts to cover wa6
largely responsible for the final rally. The
concentrated nature of the buying and the
Identity of the brokers by whom It was done,
especially in the stocks which were picked out
tor the trrea. test show of strength, were war
rant for the conviction that the speculative
leadership wan in tlw hands of the coterie
which made a demonstrative change from the
boar to the bull side cf the market during the
course of Monday's trading. The selling dur
ing the last half hour was also of a very
concentratrd character, but was by different
brokers from Shose who executed the early
lruylng orders. The deduction that large
speculative pront-taklnÂ«c was being made ls
not a ftranjte nne. The consistent weakness
of Missouri Pacific, which fell at one time 84
points b*low yesterday's high level, left little
room for credence in the rumors of a big
Southwestern railroad consolidation and gavo
color to Uie report that a large short Interest
in the rtock had settled by private agree
ment. There was a distinct shifting of spec
ulative interest from the railroads to the in
dustrials and It was the evidences of re_lli
lng in the railroad list under cover of the new
strength In the Industrials that caused the
break in the market. Such early gains as 2'i
in St. Paul. 2V In Brooklyn Transit. 2% in
Baltimore and Ohio, 2% In People's Gas, and
ethers nearly as substantial, were complete
ly wiped out In the late reaction. The de
rline from the highest reached 3% in St. Paul.
S'g in nrookl>-n Transit. 2H tn Delaware and
Hudson, l'-4 In Baltimore and Ohio and Man
hattan, and from 1 to 2 points In a laxge
number of active stocks. The steel stocks re
â¢<-t*_ from the bert in sympathy but hardened
wain In the late dealings. -The leaders rose
to the best at the close on heavy absorption.
3-Vderal Steel rose 3"$. Pressed Steel Car rose
en extreme Â«*4 while the annji.il meeting was
!n M-Mlcn and the preferred 3H- All the
mart Important members in the group gained
from 1 to 3 points. There waÂ» no nrvt to ac
oount for the rise and the fact that the dis
turbances which threaten the steel trade might
bÂ»> settled by the few Individuals who control
the resources In that trade at present natur
ally makes them available' for speculative
manipulation. Th* volume of the gold exports
fnr to-morrow, which rose to $3.S5n,O00, had
rather a chilling eCect on the late specula- j
tton. In spite of the continued large flow of
money to this center.
Money continues very easy In all depart
ments of the market.
With the exception cf the reaction in Wa
hÂ«sh bonds, the msrket for bonds was gen
erally firm. .Total sales. $4,800,000. United 3s
advanced l ; on the last call.

DENVER. Jan. 23. â Queen Bess, a little
fox terrier, has not neglected her oppor
tunities to study surgical operations. Bess
became an attache of the police surgeon
when, about a year ago. she staggered
into, the City Hall to die. She had been
poisoned. Dr. Miller saved her life with
a stomach pump. She is the especial pro
tege of Driver McClanathan. and two
weeks ago while running with the ambu
lance one of the horses stepped on her
left hind foot. The calk of the shoe near
ly cut the foot off.
The- police surgeon sewed up the cut
and bandaged It. Be*Â« limped about, but
was not satisfied. A week ago Driver Mc-
Clanathan found that she had torn off the
bandages and was busy biting off the in
lured member. Her teeth crushed the
bone and at length the foot dropped to
the floor. Bess stopped the bleeding with
her tongue. In a few days the wound
healed, and now BM3 is as sound as ever.
The amputation of the foot Is as clean as
if done with a surgeon's knife.

DENVER. Colo., Jan. *3.â The choir
girls of St. Mark's Episcopal Church went
on a strike Monday and succeeded In
coaxing the men* to Join them. A sub
stitute choir was hastily made up of girls
from Wolfe Hall, the Episcopal school In
Denver.
The chief cause of the strike is the re
moval of Organist Dingley Brown, now in
Kalamazoo. Mich. Rector Houghton of
SU Mark's says that Mr. Brown was re
moved to make place for a precentor who
could play the organ and assist the rector
in his church work too. The other reason
is a report that the rector said privately
that he wanted a "real choir"â thai those
engaged were "weil enough to flll In,"
but that he would like to have some ling
ers. *
A week ago the choir girls removed
their vestments from the church and last
Sunday morning the men did the same,
the twenty-one members of the choir
pledging themselves never to sing In St.
Mark's again. One of the strikers Is a
niece of the rector.

which was sent to the Blonde Islands,
eastward to Ltd Tung, to suppress the
pirates whose depredations upon native
craft were becoming serious, has succeed
ed In destroying the offending piratical
junk*.
In connection with this matter Vice Ad
miral Alieff. the Russian commander has
written to Vice Admiral Seymour, in com
mand of the English naval forces, claim
ing that inasmuch as the islands are In
Russian territory the British action was
unwarranted. He expressed a hope that
Vice Admiral Seymour would view the
matter in the same light. Vice Admiral
8eymour replied to the effect' that though
he. knew that Port Arthur and Tallenwan
were in Russian territory he did not
know that this was _ the case regarding
these inlands and that be was therefore
unable to coincide with Vice Admiral
AliefTs views and that he could only re
fer the question to his Government. Vice
Admiral Seymour thinks that the Russian
pretensions to . islands miles from Port
Arthur ought not to be allowed. If ad
mitted it iÂ» the opinion of the British
naval commander it would almost nat
urally follow that Russia would claim the
NIa Tao group, lying, much nearer and
extending across tha gulf of Pechill. thus
giving Russia complete control of the
navigation of the gulf. - .

have been excluded from the public
school, his son had been excluded from
college and he and his family shunned
by all. Indignation Is high and if other
cases of smallpox break out they will be
charged to him and violence is feared.
The secretary of the Wisconsin Board

APPLETON. TVIs.. Jan. 23.â Appleton is
wiid with indignation and fear over the
action of a hitherto reputable physician,
who, with deliberate Intention, exposed to
smallpox contagion scores of people In
this city and Green Bay.
The physielatt is Dr. M. J. RodermurM.
an eye and ear specialist, who has long
enjoyed local notoriety through his denial
of the germ theory of disease and the
contagiousness of any disease whatso
ever. He has just published a book in
support of his theory-
Last week a case of smallpox was dis
covered here. Rodermund seized upon
this case as a chance to prove his theor
ies. Upon his own confession he went to
the Quarantined house, rubbed hfs hands
over the postules on the patient until they
broke. then smeared virus over hi? nands,
face and clothes. He then went home to
his family, ate supper, and later went to
the Business Men's Club, where he played
cards until a late hour, taking pains to
rub against and put his hands on as many
people as possible. This was on Monday
afternoon and evening. Tuesday, with
out having washed or fumieated himself.
he went to Green Bay. where he met
many patients and others.
News of this wholesale exposure did not
leak out until to-day upon his return from
Green Bay. A meeting of the City Board
of Health was called, but they found
there is a doubt of the legal organization
of the beard. The best legal advise tells
them they have no legal remedy against
Rodermund.

There Is a criminal named William Reno
now in jail, where he has been at various
times for the greater part of twenty-two
years. The theory of Mr. Unger Is that
Hall and Reno got Into a row and Reno
struck Hall. Physicians say that cancer
of the breast may be caused by a Wow.
Dr. Hamilton Williams, who performed
the autopsy on Hall and found death due
to cancer of the breast. Raid there were
no marks of violence on the body of 'the
woman.
Mr. Unger said that at about the time
named Hall entered his oclce in the com
pany of William Reno and was arrested
on the charge of offering "straw bail."
Hall was intoxicated. Mr. Unger says
Hall was sent to prison by Recorder Goff.
A week later Hall was liberated at the In
stance of Goff. who found that the charge
was unfounded.
Mr. Unger sent the letter to the office of
the Coroner and District Attorney Phll
bln was Informed. He said that he would
await the result of the inquest before
taking: action.
This action, if taken, will be the result
of a letter found a day or two ago by
Henry W. Unger, formerly an Assistant
District Attorney, among some old docu
ments, and which Mr. Unger thinks was
sent to him at the District Attorney's Of
fice in the latter part of November. 1S3S.
In the letter, which expressed gratitude
to Mr. Unger. Hail said: "I have been
most cruelly disabled for life by that
wicked villain William Reno, who drug
ged and sandbagged me after robbing me
of what money I had about me and
brought me into your office to make a
show of me. I have never recovered.
Every week of my life I have severe
bleeding attacks, which render me almost
useless."

"It is the judgment of this court that
you be taken to the State penitentiary at
Folsom and be there imprisoned for the
term of forty-flre years."
In these words Judge Greene this morn-
Ing brought to a close the quiet trial re
sulting in the conviction of "Buck Eaton" |
of a crime for which burning at the stake
has of late been In vogue in some commu
nities. The prisoner, whose light came li ]
"William Eden, clutched at the table be- I
fore which he stood as he heard the ap
palling sentence Imposed by the court,
then turned and staggered to where his
a The S assault for which Eden has received ;
practically a life term was committed in
West Oakland last spring. MUs Martha
McGraw, the victim, was returning from
church SI a late hour when she was at
tacked by threÂ« men. all of whom she rec
ognized. The next day the police arrested
two young men named Cronln and Keat
ing on warrants sworn to by Miss Mc
'Graw. Eden, against whom a complaint
was also lodged, made his escape and
was not arrested for several weeks. He
was traced to Butte. Mont, and taken
into custody by the offlcers there.
Keating was tried first, but the Jury dis
agreed. Eden's trial followed and
Cronin's case is now before the court.
Before delivering sentence Judge Greene
solemnly charged the prisoner to mend his
ways.
â¢The crime of which you have been
convicted," he eaid. "Is a peculiarly hein
ous one and Justly regarded with the
greatest abhorrence among all civilized
peoples. The sentence which I shall im
pose will no doubt be regarded as too
lenient by many on that account- I have
considered the case In its different
aspects to the best of my ability and have
endeavored to act wisely. The sentence
designedly leaves you the opportunity to
reform after its termination and to fulSll
in a measure your duty to yourself and
to your fellow men." Then followed tne
sentence.
Eden will be able, if he receives full
credit for good behavior, to reduce his
term to a month less than twenty-seven
years.
Just after the prisoner had been taken
from the court it was discovered that
there was a slight error In the proceed
ings. Judge Greene ordered Eden brought
back, had the sentence stricken otit and
then rectified the mistake and reimposed
sentence. -.
NO SCIENCE IS SHOWN

Police Stop Some Bouts at Bay City
Athletic Club to Avert a Pos

Science was thrown to the winds last
night at the "amateur" boxing exhibition
given by the Bay City Athletic Club. The
contestants slugged each other Into insen
sibility and the large crowd that filled
the gymnasium was satisfied. A number
of the men who were scheduled to take
part were barr*>d because they were
known to b^ professional fighters. The
balance of the card was made up of box
ers who have fought for "trophies" dur
ing the past year and are looked upon as
bona-fide amateurs.

was entitled to a decision over "Young"

Wild Story Along the Water Frqnt That a Man Had Been
Shahghaieid on the " Wind Jammer" Gayhead.
The Draymen's Association has a kick
coming over, the condition -of Howard
street wharf No. 3." The floor of the struc
ture is bltuminized, and the teamsters say
it is very . slippery. Through ' Williams,
Dimond & Co. .they asked that the wharf
be sanded. â¢ The board decided that.it had
nothing to do with the matter and refused
to entertain the proposition.
'. The Union Iron W otks submitted a blue
print of > proposed dredging around the
place : where the launching of the Ohio
will take place. The matter was referred
to the chief engineer and there will be
plenty of water in the* basin when Presi
dent McKlnley views the launching of the
big battleship. â¢ - ~
The proposed building of a new wharf
inger's office on Broadway wharf was re
ferred to the chief engineer.
The Merchants' Transportation Com
pany was given a temporary berth at the
foot of Washington' street for their steam
ship City of Dawson. The vessel wae
built for the Yukon trade, but was later
sold to pay expenses. She is now going
to run opposition between here and Sac
ramento. * â¢ â¢ - ~-> : Â¦â¢".-'
The contract : for building three sheds
between slips 4 and kon the front was let
to Hannah Bros, for $4849.
Robert Wakefleld offered to remove
Fishermen's wharf and the ferry slips at
Lombard street for the lumber and ma
terial he might save. The Commissioners
gave, him- the contract with the proviso
that all submerged piles must be removed
ana a depth of 30 feet at low water pro
vided at all wharves where vessels dock.
Her Days Are Numbered.
The barkentlne "W. H. Dimond will prob
ably never be seen In Ban Francisco Bay
again. She takes a general cargo from
here to Honolulu and on her arrival there
will be dismantled and turned into a coal
hulk and used to -supply the steamships
of the Oceanic Steamship Company and
will probably end her days in Hawaiian
waters. I Captain Houdlette, now master
of the fine new steamship Sierra, was for
merly in command of the Dimond, while
Captain Drew, now of the Andrew "Welch,
serwsd seven years in her. The Dimond
is' a good carrier and has always.made

HARBOR COMMISSIONERS MEET.
Many. Matters of - Importance Are
. Passed TJpon by the Board.
ONE of the first of Â»the whalers to
get away was the bark Gayhead.
She was towed to sea" yesterday
- by. the tug Redmond and from
here .will . go to the Â¦ Southern
Seas. Formerly a vessel clearing on such
an ; expedition' would give her destination
as ;Guam. That was In ' the Â¦ days ; when
Guam meant nowhere. Now It Is an Isl
and under the American ftag, and whalers
clear for a cruise in the Okhotsk Sea, via
Honolulu. ; â¢
, There was some trouble on the Gayhead
before she got to sea.; One of the sailors
was taken aboard drunk and immediately
a cry went. along the front that he had,
been shanghaied. The fact of the matter
was that the man secured a few dollars
yesterday and got. drunk. His boarding
master -. rounded him up in a Barbary
Coast saloon, took him to the front in a
wagon and put him aboard his ship.
The Gayhead : leads the , fleet of wind
jammers, . but in a few weeks from Â¦ now
the - steamships will be headed for the
Arctic and once more the chase after the
leviathan of the deep will begin. Vessels
that go to the Okhotsk are principally
after sperm oil, while vessels that go to
the Arctic are after bone.

State Prison Directors are anxiously

who is going over what few books are left
at San Quentin Prison. The books kept
from 1896 up to the time that .Walden, the
absconding clerk of the Jute mills, sud
denly disappeared are the subject, of ex
amination as are also the books of the
late Clerk 'Ellis. .The expert has been
instructed by the Directors to look
"over, the accounts of the. commissary "de
partment. . ' " . > : ! .
."I do not expect that any more dis
crepancies [ will be found," said Director
Fitzgerald yesterday. ''I believe that the
only trace of crooked .work that willbe
found is -the theft >of "the sixty-flve bales
of Jute by Walden. was an ex
ceedingly;'clever accountant and undoubt

there is but' little hope of any other, pecu

stroyed any of >the .books/: the description

â¢but we do" know that thework of the ex

But, ' as ;i said j before,^ I am ; satisfied from

now I could fix the date of my writing to
Hale. I know that it was Just prior to
his leaving San Quentin."
The local police have sent out Inquiries
concerning Walden, but as yet they have
not been able to get any trace of him.
The fact that he went away from the
prison on the pica. 'of taking a. vacation
gave him a good start and he made the
best of it. He dropped completely out of
sight, and being well supplied with funds,
found but little to retard him in bis flight.
The strongest chance of his being caught
is through some former convict.. He was
for so many years in the jute mill, both
as a convict and a free man, that he is
well known to all of the convicts and one
of them may identify him In some far out
of the way nlace.

that when he discovered that he had been

Deaf Mute Searches the Face of the Globe for the Man He Believes Injured Him and
Finds Him in the Old People's Home in Sin Franc
THIS morning: Dr. William H.
Newell, an aped. Infirm, white
haired physician, who is now an
inmate of the Old People's
Home at PinÂ© and Pierce
streets, will be charged with
fraud and felony embezzlement,
and the Superior Court will be asked to
place him under arrest until he pays
Â¦what his accuser claims was stolen from
him. The story which has led to this re
markable climax in the life of an old man
is a Ftrarse one.
Eleven years ago Dr. Newell was a
practicing; physician of prominence In
Jersey City. One afternoon he received
a patient, a young fellow, dark-skinned,
black-eyed, alert. The patient wanted
advice; the physician pave it. A relation
of complete confidence was established,
and the two men 1 became something more
than physician and patient to each
other. Dr. Newell so far possessed the
confidence of his young patient that he
advised him how to invest the money
which he possessed. And as a result of
that investment the patient claims now
that he was robbed.
Searches All Over the World.
Dr. Newell left Jersey City and traveled
to the "West- His patient, who is now
instituting his. sensational suit, is Frank
D. Sheldon, a student in the College of
Pharmacy of the University of California
and a clerk in the drug store of Garrett
& Tagsert in Oakland. Mr. Sheldon is a
deaf mute who has the power, occasional
ly possessed by men laboring under a dis
Â«dvcntape !-uch as his, to speak not flu- ,
erily nor volubly, but plainly enough to
be understood. He says he has traveled
around the world searching for the man (
Â¦who, he claims, robbed him. He has vis
ited every large city In the United States.
He has gone to Europe.' He has traveled
to Australia, and everywhere he has i
searched for the man who Invested his
money and pave to him no returns. In
Â«very great city he visited Sheldon sought
for the man who had taken his money.
But he did not find Dr. Newell.
Accidentally Meets Newell.
Fir.ally he came to San Francisco. His ;
money vras exhausted and he was forced
to prepare himself for a livelihood. He ,
Â«r.terod the College of Pharmacy of the
I'nivcrsity of California as a student and
dismissed, as far as he could, his experi
Â«nce wrltb Dr. Newell. He had received
from the aged physician several letters,
pent in care, from various places, to Jer
Â¦jey City. â¢ These letters purported to come
from Mexico, but it is significant that Dr.
Newell was In San Francisco when they
Â¦were sent from Mexico. Mr. Sheldon re
ceived these letters and thought nothing
more of them. He took a precaution,
however, to preserve them and in them
selves they tell a rather interesting story.
One afternoon Sheldon stepped from a
Haight-street car at Market and Kearny
Ftreets and in his haste jostled into Dr.
Newc-11, the xnaa for whom he had
eearched for nearly ten years. Dr. Newell
did not know him and Sheldon insists that
he did not want to. The result of that
meeting is the suit which will be insti
tuted this rcorning-.
Complaint Alleges Criminal Acts.
The complaint, in which Sheldon makes
his serious allegations against the aged
physician, is remarkable in several ways.
Due to Operation Performed by Him.
Â¦"'Â¦>,Â¦-.,
It asks of \ the Superior Court that Dr.
Newell beg adjudged guilty of having
feloniously embezzled and fraudulently
converted to his own use and benefit $3000
belonging to Prank D. Sheldon. It also
asks that Dr. Newell be adjudged guilty
of fraud and that an order of arrest be
immediately issued against him by the
Superior Court. The complaint In full Is
as follows:
Frank D. Sheldon, plaintiff, vs. Â¦William H.
Newell, defendant.
Now comes plaintiff and complains of said
defendant and for cause of action alleges:
That on or about the 5th day of September,
1S31. in the State of New Jersey, said defend
ant, William H. Newell, while acting as the
agent of said plaintiff, received of and from
plaintiff the sum of three thousand dollars
<$SOO0) In United States gold coin, the prop
erty cf said plaintiff, in trust for said plain
tiff.
That Immediately thereafter, to wit on the
6th day of September. 1591, . said defendant.
"William H. Newell, acting under the lnstruc
tlcns of said plaintiff and In accordance with
Fiid .trust and acting as the agent of plaintiff.

($2000) In purchasing fifty shares of ' capital
Block of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Com
pany, a corporation In the city and State of

Agrees to Hold Stock as Agent.
That Immediately thereafter and on or* about
