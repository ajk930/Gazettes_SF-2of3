in confinement, and the Eame time has
elapsed since Miss Mary Hoffman of San

authorities nor the Bellevue Hospital
authorities when asked for information
by The Call correspondent to-night could
give tho slightest clew as to their where
abouts beyond what has appeared in the
telegraphic dispatches from Montreal,
Canada. The Call correspondent at Mon
treal by means of a picture printed in the
Herald identified Mr. Johnson as a party
who engaged passage for Europe en the
Tunisian, but the landlady at whoso
house Rev. Mr. Johnson's female com
panion lived for a few days was not so
sure of the identity of the lady.

Hoffman left the hospital in order to
avoid being a witness in connection 'with
the brutal treatment of patients there a
new piece of information is published
here. Mrs. 'Edward Hughes of this city,
but formerly of Phtsbiirg. Pa., made a
statement to-day to the effect that her
husband, who died in St. Luke's Hospi

cause of injuries received In Bellevue
Hospital. She says she saw him In a
straitjacket and made to trot up and
down a corridor In the Bellevue Insane
Pavilion while an attendant flogged him
with a long strap tipped with metal.
Later it was found that seven of his ribs
had been fractured..-

the present organization of his part/, so
as to take the lead In a new movement.

There are rumors that the Supreme
Court is divided on the question now be

does not follow the flap: into new terri

whether well founded or not, have per
suaded Harrison to take the, course he has
in the matter.
The ex-President has. however,, many
friends In Washington who indignantly
deny the right of the administration to
find fault with him because he Is exer
cising his right as an American citizen
to discuss a grave constitutional ques
tion in which every one is interested.
This defense of the ex-President does not
satisfy the adminfstration people that he
has not some ulterior pwrposÂ© in devoting
so much attention to this question at thia
particular time. Harrison is booming the
lysue, and should the Supreme Court de
cide against the Government's conten
tion it will in Washington be regarded
as a victory for thÂ© ex-President as well
as a 'defeat for President McKlnley.

OMAHA, Jan. 2.â Another letter, printed
with a lead pencil, was received by E. A.
Cudahy this afternoon, demanding the
withdrawal of the reward offered for the
kidnapers. The fact that the address
was printed In similar style to the former
one save rise to the suspicion before It
was opened that it was from the same
source, but Mr. Cudahy stated to-night
that it was a rank Imitation and said he
did not attach the slightest significance to
it.. It was mailed in the postofflce about
3:30 o'clock in the afternoon. He showed
the letter to a reporter, and said it was
evidently patterned after the fac Â¦ simile
of the former letter that had been printed.
He stated that it was of the same class
as several others that had been received
from various points, except that it had
been printed. He pointed out that there
was a marked dissimilarity between it
and the one received from the kidnapers,"
both In the phape of the letters and the
general wording of it, as well as in the
spelling. Apparently every word that
was possible of misspelling was mis
spelled. The letter demanded the with
drawal of the Cudahy offer of and
of the city's offer as well under penalty
not only, of trouble for the children, but
the' destruction of the entire "Cudahy
family." The epistle closed with an in
junction to "heed this warning:."
Â¦ Bdward A.-Cudahy Jr. failed to-day to
identify J. J. ! Crowe as one of the men
who - kidnaped' nirtf.^ Cudahy -appeared at
the City Jail and confronted Crowe In
the Bertllllon room. After looking at the
suspect five minutes or more young
Cudahy remarked: "I never saw that man
before. He is not the one who stood
guard over me. and if he had anything
at all to do vrlth the kidnaping, I did not
see him." Crowe was then released.
Secret Service Agent "Wltten to-day
stated positively that he saw Pat Crowe
in St. Joseph, Mo., the Friday after the
kidnaping. He does not think he was
one of the kidnapers.
A'Chadron (Nebr.) special says: It was
reported this afternoon that the officers
who were reported to have captured Pat
Crowe, the alleged abductor of young Ed
ward Cudahy at Omaha, while endeavor
ing to make good his escape across the
Pine Ridge country yesterday, were
thrown off their guard by Crowe's friends
and sympathizers, many of whom live
near the agency. Crowe's friends are
said to be spiriting him away to the
"Hole-In-the-Wall" country in 'Wyoming,
where he is to Join an old-time friend and

RUSSIA MAKES
HEAVY DEMANDS
Salient Points of Proposed
Agreement With
China.
LONDON, Jan. 3Â»â The Peking corre
spondent of the Daily Mail, wiring Janu
ary 1, says: Russia by conciliation is try
ing to secure special advantages, and
there Is a strong belief that she will re
ceive American support. It is hinted that
Russia inspired unfounded charges of
barbarity aguinst the German troops, her
motive being to sow dissension between
Great Britain and Germany. / '
Id a dispatch to the Times from Peking
dated December 31 Dr. Morrison gives the
text of the Rueso-ChSnese agreement for
the Russian protection of the Manchurian
province of Fen ting. Russia, he says,
consents that China . shall resume the
civil government on the following condi
tions: Â¦
Firstâ The Tartar general, Tseng, un
dertakes to protect and pacify the prov
ince and to assist in the construction of
the railroad.
Secondâ He must treat kindly, feed and
lodge Russians engaged in the military
occupation and in the protection of the
railroad.
Thirdâ He must disarm and disband the
Chinese soldiers, delivering to the Rus
sians all ammunition in tuch arsenals as
the Russians have not yet occupied.
Fourthâ All forts and defenses in the
province not occupied by the Russians
and all powder magazines not required
by them must be dismantled in the pres
ence cf Russian officials.
' Fifthâ Nleuchwang â¢ and ! other places
now in Russian occupation shall be re
stored to the Chinese civil administration
when Russia is satisfied that the pacifica
tion of the. province is complete.
Sixthâ The Chinese shall maintain law
and order by local police under a Tartar
grant-
Seventhâ A Russian political resident,
with general powers of control, shall be
stationed at Mukden, to whom the Tartar
General Tseng must give all information
respecting any important measures.
Eighthâ In the event of the local police
being insufficient for any emergency Gen
eral Tseng will notify the Russian resi
dent and invite Russia to send reinforce
ments. Â¦'â¢Â¦'â¢'â¢;
Ninthâ The Russian text shall be- the
standard.
Â¦ "The functions g-lven the- Russian resi
dent," says Dr. Morrjson, "are similar to
thOEp.of the Russian residents in Bok
hara" or those of the British residents in
the native States' of India.
"Tho agreement will necessarily be fol
lowed by similar agreements with refer
ence to two other provinces. Then Man
churia will bo de facto a Russian pro
tectorate, Russia by a pre-existing ar
rangement having already the right to
maintain all troops necessary for the pro
tection of the railway."
Commenting upon the information'
transmitted by Dr. Morrison, the Times
says: The problem raised is very serious.
The agreement Is utterly Irreconcilable
with Russia's professed attitude toward
China and the assurances she has volun
teered, to the powers. In fact, the situa
tion contemplated by -. the Anglo-German
agreement seems definitely to confront us.
GREAT NORTHERN
BUYS COAL BEDS
Pays Five Million Dollars
for Eastern Washington
. â¢ Â¦-'â¢ â¢"'Â¦" Mines.
SPOKANE, Jan. 2.â The Great North
ern has secured a monopoly of the vast
British Columbia coal fields near the
Crowsnest Pass. To-day 'at St. Paul.
Mr. Hill arranged to purchase the prop
erty of the Crowsnest '. Pass Coal Com
pany, for a price, approximately $5,000,000.
The details of the transfer were arranged
after several days' conference with Presi
dent Cox of Toronto and other heavy
stockholders of the Crowsnest Company.
The property includes 276,000 acres
of land.
Extensive development has been done on
these properties, which are now shipping
1500 tons daily. The coal Is of. fine quality
and tests on the Great Northern show it
is excellent for locomotives.
The Great. Northern has purchased from
the Canadian Government 10.000 acres of
coal lands ten miles south of the Crows
nest fields.
Following these purchases, the an
nouncement is made of the intention of
the Great Northern to build a railroad to
the property. The road will start at
Great Falls. Mont., run northwesterly
across the main line near Blackfoot and
thence to a connection with the Canadian
Pacific near Livingston.
In the past few weeks the Great North
ern has had surveyors In the field seeking
a feasible route. This, it is said, they
have found. It is understood here that
the construction of the road will bo com
menced at the earliest possible date this
spring. The proposed road will not only
shorten the distance between the Crows
nest coke ovens and the Great Falls
smelter but will open a country rich in
timber resources.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASHLAND. Or.. Jan. 2.â The worst
snowstorm since the winter of 18S9-90
throughout Southern Oregon and North
ern California began last night and has
continued during the past twenty-four
hours. Telegraph and telephone com
munication has been paralzyed north
and south during the day, and to-night
the wires are down eouth of Dunsmulr.
The Southern Pacific has experienced
great difficulty, in keeping its track clear
between Ashland and Dunsmulr.
The snowplows have been working con
tinuously since 7 o'clock a. m. in the Sls
klyous, where the snow Is seven feet deep
on the level and fourteen feet. In the cuts
and drifts, and the rotary plow Is now
working north from Dunsmuir. All pas
senger trains have been able to get
through five and six hours behind sched
ule time, but all freight trains are an
nulled. The railroad officials have been
vigorously combating the storm and
despite its severity believe they will suc
ceed in getting all passenger trains
through without any serious delay.
The storm center appears to have been
on the south side of the Sisklyous, ex
tending as far as tho canyon of the Sac
ramento, with much drifting of the snow
on the south side of the mountains, while
on the Oregon side it is wet and does not
drift.
The following Is the snowfall at the
principal points In the track of the storm:
Ashland, 12 inches; Jacksonville, 13
Inches; Treka, 4& feet; Sisson. 5 feet;
Dunsmulr, 5 feet; Slskiyou. 7 feet. Indi
cations are that the backbone of -the
storm is broken.
In northern points of the Rogue River
Valley it is growing warmer and raining
late to-night.

fears that the continued cold weather
might damage the new citrus crop are

The frost last night was general
throughout this section, but in no in

all trees as having safely passed through
the. ordeal. Highlands, Pomona, Glen

and Lamanda all escaped. Ontario, how
ever, reports that lemons may have suf
fered slightly, while at Pomona the frost
last night and early this morning was ex
ceptionally severe. Azusa reported seven
sixteenths of an inch of ice, but the fruit
crop Is toO far advanced to be seriously
affected.

ARGUING STATUS
OF PORTO RICO
ment to the Constl- â¢;
y tution.
WASHINGTON'. Jan. 2.^-The first briefs
to be filed In the cases Involving the rela
tion of the United States 4 to its insular
possessions, which are to be argued in the.
Supreme Court next week, were submitted
to-day. There are- eight of the cases and
briefs were filed in the cases of Carlos
Armstrong and of Samuel B. Downes. In
both cases the briefs, represent the par
ties opposing tlie contentions, of the Gov
ernment, .y* -
. Armstrong Is a British subject .doing
business In Ponce. P. R., and he sues to
recover tariff duties collected on goods
imported into Porto Rico from New York,
Philadelphia and Baltimore. The Court
of Claims decided against him and he ap
peals from that decision. The brief in
this- case was tiled bv John C. Chancy
on behalf of Mr. Armstrong.
The plea is made in the brief that the
collection of duties wa.<. in the circum
stances, a -violation of the constituion of
the United States, as by the terms of the
Paris treaty the island of Porto Rico be
came a portion of the United States. The
brief lays down the following propositions
as the basis of the appellant's contend
tions:
The constitution. of the United States reaches
over every portion of the national domain,
whether in thÂ» form of St!Â»tes. Territories or
districts, because the constitution provides for
Territories as well as States. The cession
made by Spain in the treaty of Paris pro
duced an r.tsoluto change of title and sover
eignty in Porto Rico.
The President of the United States is an
executive officer. He has no right to exercise
legislative functions. The imposition by
executive order of customs duties on com
merce between the island of Porto Rico and
ether parts of the United States after the
treaty of reace .nnil the exchan.ee of ratifica
tions is unauthorized and void and the collec
tion of such ran ifs is without warrant of law.
A government without limitations was never
Intended by 1 the founders of the nation. They
sought to establish and did â¢ establish a con
stitutional republic, which furnishes a written
guarantee of protection to all of its inhabi
tants. The Men that in one portion of thÂ«
country the executive and legislative authority
is subject to retitrlctlons and limitations and
that In another portion It- ir; without any re
striction or limitationâ that in one part a re
publican government rxlsu* and in another, part
an unlimited despotism, is repugnant to the
theory Â¦ upon' which the Government was
founded. Everv inhabitant is entitled to the
protection afforded by the bill of rights.
A large portion of the brief is devoted
to the refutation of the doctrine laid down
by the Attorney General In the Goetee
case, recently argued, by him in the Su
preme Court to the effect that the Gov
ernment of the United States should have
an unlimited hand in control of territory
outside of the States. Replying to this
declaration, Mr. Chaney says:
Mr. McKinley is'th* President of the United
Statesâ the President of Its territory and its
people. He Is not the President of other ter
ritory or people and he is the despot of no peo
ple and no territory. He was never elected or
commissioned i the despot of anybody or any
thing Â¦
The Congress Is the Congress of the United
States â the Congress of the territory and the
people of the United States. It is not the
Congress of any other territory or people. It
is omnipotent nowhere on the face of the earth.
It was created by the people of the United
States under a constitution specifically pointing
out Its powers and .duties. It exists by vir
tue of that constitution, as does also theÂ«Prebl
dentlal office. .. â¢. . '.' 'â¢.;Â¦
It Is omnipotent 'nowhere. The only-omni
potent thing this side- of- heaven is the consti
tution formulated (by the\fathers out of times
which proved the necessity of providing against
despotism in the Presidential office and Against
the omnipotence of men representing the peo
ple of the United States.'.- â¢
OnÂ« wouli (Mi'li to hear the arguments ad
vanced . by the Government that there are no
restrictions or limitations of any sort upon
Congress or the President, so far as the Terri
tories are concerned, They may give to
Alaska absolute -monarchy: they may give
to the Hawaiian Islands a. republic: they may
give to Porto Rico such a government aa Wey
ler- would provide. They may give to the
Philippines a form 'of government after the
plan of Turkey and China. They may estab
lish a republic in one part and a monarchy In
another, i They may deny to the unfortunate
inhabitants of these Islands all the recognized
rights and privileges which characterize the
coies of civilized nations. In short, they may
restore all the relica of barbarism and there
is no power on earth to stop or control them.
It Is no answer to this to say that the Con
gress is too enlightened and the President too
merciful to commit such acts of tyranny and
oppression. That does not change the ques
tion. We contend that no such right exists;
that Congress in its government of Territories
Is itself subject to constitutional limitations
and that the peopl" of those Territories or
colonies are protected by these limitations and
that they may themselves appeal to that in
strument for protection.
The brief In the Downes case was filed
by F. R. Coudert Jr. In this case excep
tion is taken to the imposition of dutie*
on goods imported into the United States
from Porto Rico.
Mr. Coudert, quoting the decision of the
Supreme Court in the. Cherokee Nation
case asks: "If the Paris treaty did not
make Porto Rico a part of the United
States, how could the Congress of the
United States be vested with the right to
legislate for it and to determine the civil
rights and political status of its native In
habitants." ;-vi.-;-
to his own question, Mr.
Coudert said: "Tho Congress of the
United States is not vested by the consti
tution and cannot, therefore, be invested
by treaty with the power to legislate for
a foreign country." * *
Mr. Coudert also suggests the possibility
of an amendment to the constitution, say-
Ing: "Nor need there be any concern
with reference to expediency. If the
people of the United States deem It ex
pedient that the additional powers exer
cised by their temporary agents should
be approved and should be continued to
their successors, the people can so ordain.
The constitution has provided an easy
method for their so ordaining. It has not
established the Supreme Court for that
purpose. A constitutional, amendment,
if demanded by the people, can be pre
sented in Congress and ratified by the
Legislatures in less time than It -will take
this court to unravel and determine. â¢ the
momentous questions involved in this
case. If a revolution In' our method of
government and in the principles
for which this Government stands
Is to bo made. It should be made
by the power which Is at the base of all
governmentâ the peopleâ for /whose bene
fit the Government is made. It certainly
should not be done by a court intended
to be a conservator of all our institutions
and not the voice of the people to change
the form and character of those institu
tions." i,,::/ : '
Coudert Sug-gests an Easy Remedy
by the Adoption of an Amend-
Court.

OMAHA; Nebr., Jan. 2.â A special
from Lincoln says: At a meet
.Ifig of the executive committee
of the board of university re
gents to-day the enpagement of
Dr. Edward A. Ross.' lately dropped from
the list of professors of the Leland Stan
ford' University, was completed. P.oss, It
will be remembered, claimed his dismissal
from Stanford was due to his Bryanite
views of trusts, railroads and free silver
being distasteful to Mrs. Stanford, the
patron of the institution, while the. official
explanation was that his lectures trenched
too "closely on a vicious assault on the or
igin of the Stanford fortune reflecting on
the memory of. Mrs. Stanford's late hus
band. Ross was also mentioned frequent
ly in connection with an editorial position
on Bryan's new paper.
The way was paved for his engagement
In- Nebraska University by Chancellor
Andrews at last month's regents'
meeting, where, at his urgency, it
was referred to the executive com
mittee in violation of the univer
sity rules requiring an indorsement

Injunction of secrecy was given at the
time. To-day the fusion members of the
executive committee completed the ar
rangement. Professor Rcss to begin work

ways and means for lifting the stagna

directors will meet to-morrow morning, it
is believed some notion will then be taken,
possibly the allowance of a discount to the

ferentials to European exporters. .. v This,
some growers claim, will do away with
the antagonism of the Eastern menand
cause a buying of N prunes.

The surest and safest treatment for any
form of Catarrh Is an Internal remedy
which acts specifically upon the b'ood and
mucous membranes. Such a remedy la
the new preparation sold everywhere by
druggists as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, a
medicine in pleasant tablet form.
These tablets contain in highly concen-
trated form well known germ antiseptics
like sanguinarla, gualacol, Red Gum and
Bimirar curative elements, and no one who
suffers from any form of catarrh and
has experienced the inefficiency and In-
convenience of powders, sprays and inhal-
ers will ever go back to such antiquated
remedies after once trying so pleasant a
treatment as Stuart's Catatrh Tablets,
and one which gives so much relief In bo
short a time.
Druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
at fifty cents for full elzed package, and
their dally use will effectually cure this
troublesome and dangerous disease.
The danger from. catarrh Is that It is a
short road to consumption, to chronic
stomach catarrh' and to catarrh of liver
and kidneys.
Most cases of deafness axe caused from
stoppage of the eustachlan tube as a re-
sult of catarrh.

in. a game of cards. A Â¦ discussion arose
as.tto the winner of the stakes -and the
proprietor put the pair, out of the place.
They went up the street, continuing their
altercation. When they reached the cor
ner of Jefferson and Sixth streets Officer
Ilankel saw Brush make a rush at Gio
vanni. T l|p latter tore a picket from the
feno<? ana struck his assailant on the
head and Brush fell. The offlcer hurried
to the spot and Giovanni ran back to the

hldlnir place, but' he was found, and -ar
rested. Â¦ Brush â¢ was taken 'to the Jenner
Sanitarium,. where he died at 4:30 o'clock
this afternoon. Â¦
The Coroner's Inquest over the body of
Brush, who was Â¦ of Indian and Mexican
descent, "â¢ was held this evening. The Jury
charged Giovanni wlth.his death.
The "following are the /officers elected:
Chairman. Augustus L." Tllden: 'first vice
chairman, Morris L,. Ascher: second vice chair
man, Edward M. Buckley; secretary, A. B.
Mahoney; treasurer. Max Goldberg.
All of these were elected without oppo
sition except Mahoney. John F. Mc-
Glynn was also nominated for secretary
On roll-call the vote stood 47 for Mahoney
to 21 for McGlynn.
.P. A. Bergerot, chairman of the last
convention, called the meeting to order
end John F. McGlynn was made tempo
rary secretary. Wergerot paid:
"There has been some doubt expressed
as to the legality of this committee, as
the amendment to section 1186 of the Po
litical Code provides * that county com
mittees ace to be chosen biennially. I
have secured legal advice from unbiased
attorneys and their opinion Is that In any
case the amendment, can apply only to
counties where elections are held biennial
ly, and not to those, like San Francisco,
that hold annual elections. â¢ Further, the
amendment is undoubtedly unconstitu
tional, as the General Assembly has no
power to control by legislation the or
ganization of voluntary bodies."
"Bergerot was nominated for permanent
chairman by H. G. \V. -Dinkelsplel, but
he declined on the ground that honors
should be distributed. He said also:
"As simply a member of . this commit
tee I can maintain greater independence
than I can as its chairman." 1
Bergerot concluded Â¦ by nominating Au
gustus L. Tllden for chairman. Nomina
tions were promptly closed and the secre
tary cast the ballot for Tllden. .
The other officers were elected with dis
patch most pleasing to Kelly. On motion
of P. A. Bergerot - the chair was instructed
to appoint a*'. committee on by-laws, to
consist of five members. .
Some said that a sergeant-at-arms
ought to be selected.. Max Goldberg ob
jected, asserting that all the members
of the committee were gentlemen who
knew how to. conduct themselves with
decorum. Two minutes later one of Gold
berg's gentlemanly fellow members -was
calling- a man who dared express his
opinion a liar and slugging him in truo

KELLY'S WELL PREVAILED.
New Republican Committee Organ
izes by Electing- His Can
didates.
The Republican County Committee
chosen by authority of the Kelly-Criiu
mins County Convention met last night
at Shiels Hall and effected . permanent
organization. The Kelly programme
went through without a hitch, the only
delay being caused by a lack of a ma
jority of the committee until nearly 9
o'clock.
OneÂ© the meeting was called to order,
Martin Kelly, who was personally en
gineering the organization, saw to it that
business was hurried along so that he
might be free to devote all of his atten
tion to the caucus of the San- Francisco
legislative delegation, at the Palace
Hotel, in the interests of Pendleton's tight
for the Speakersljlp.
The one-man ivho- # protested against
Kelly's slate and. questioned the Republi
canism of one of the officers-elect wa3
called a liar and knocked down for his
pains. L. A. Rea of the Forty-fourth As
sembly District arose after the election of
officers was completed ajid said:
"Gentlemen, If you men are good Re
publicans I am not ar.d ought not to be
here. You have elected as first vice chair
man a man who Is not a Republican. It
Is a shame for this committee to choosa
him. for the office. He Is no more a Re
publican than Christopher, Buckley."
E. J. Morris of the Forty-second Assem
bly District, a faitHful henchman of:Kel
ly's, sprang up from his chair in front of
Rea, shouted. "You're a liar," and struck
Rea a blow on the chin that sent him in
a heap on the floor, back against the wali.
Those sitting near Interfered to prevent
further hostilities and the â¢committee at
once adjourned.
The first vice chairman elected was Mor
ris L. Ascher, but Rea meant to refer to
"Eddie" Buckley, elected as second vice
chairman. ;%- ; i r ~i';\
valuable lessons and I tell you now that
he consulted me in all of his important
political movements."
Boss Kelly was- told that neither Hig
gins nor Buckley had ever won a victory
surpassing the achievements of Pendlfe
â¢ton s indorsement ar.il the organization of
the County Committee, and was again
asked to tell the public how the battles
"The County Committee," \sald Boss
Kelly, "was organized practically when
the resolution creating it was adopted by
the convention. The tight was won in the
organization of the convention. The rest
was plain sailing."
The reporter then asked: ".Can you
trust in the I^egiolature the Assembly
men who accepted your orders to-night
to indorse Mr. PenÂ«ll<?ton for Speaker?"
"I see no reason why I cannot trust
therg in the legislature. Yes, I believe
Penuleton will be elected Speaker. I have
known him for some time and am familiar
with his career In the Legislature. He
Â¦will pick up votes outside of San Fran
cisco. Some of the boys in Los Angeles
who formerly lived here are making his
light in the south. The Llewellyn boys
who lived here in the city and worked in
the Â¦ factory are for him. The country
members will not desert the combination
of IMS Angeles and San Francisco.. It Is
my observation that interior members of
the Legislature await city action and then
combine with the forces showing the
greatest strength. They prefer the crea
tion of a nucleus."
In regard to the ability of his lieuten
ants several inquiries were addressed to
the boss:
"What sort of an understudy is John
C. Lynch?" was asked.
Boss Kelly replied: "He Is bright and
active and promises to get on very well."
"What of Jere Burke s qualifications?"
was the next question.
The boss replied: "Burke Is not as able
as Lynch, but he Is shrewd and cunning.
These qualities make him useful in poli
tics."
In the course of the Interview Boss
Kelly remarked: "In this contest for the
Speakershlp Herrln had no part. I man
aged the fight in my own way and he
made no suggestions whatever."

eral chief figures of the political push

mittee was cor.Wnued until, as was stated
at the meeting, f "the. city authorities give
tubstajitial -evidence, that pledges of re
iorm would be carried out."
Major Hurii.es agreed to do all in his
power to slop the carrilval 6t crime in

ditions beyond the appointment of ten

claimed to be doing everything possible

lation. It was pointed out, however, that

Hi? hands were badly lacerated and his
body bruised.. Etark was 75 years old.
OSS MARTIN KELLY is in the
saddle, riding roughshod over all
opposition. Higgins and Buckley
in their palmiest days of power
never received greater adulation
than was bestowed on Kelly last
night by the admiring push of San Fran
cisco.
â¢ Boss Kelly won the signal victories last
night. He organized the new County
Committee to suit himself, placing in thÂ«
chair a trusted henchman, and filling the
position of secretary with a man who will
call the roll when the boss gives the or
der. The. new secretary's fidelity to the
boss was tested in the B"nai B'rith Hall
convention.
His second achievement last night was
the rounding up of the Republican As
eembly delegates of San Francisco to in
dorse C. W. Pendleton for the speaker
ghlp. Some time was consumed In get
ting his forces consolidated at the Palace
Hotel, as a detached squad was hotly en
gaged in Shlels Hall in executing the
boss' programme of County Committee
organization. Ultimately this thirteen,
an unlucky number, assembled in the
room of the Republican State Committee
and proceeded to business. According to
the programme entrusted to "Colonel"
Brady, who boasts that he did not gain
his title by fighting for his country', the
bunch organized by electing Arthur G.
Flsk chairman and W. J. Gullfoyle sec
retary.
There must have been some hitches in
the movement to indorse Pendleton, as
Kelly waited for more than an hour in
the court of the Palace Hotel to hear the
result of the conference. He did not en
tertain, however, the slightest doubt as
to the outcome, but was somewhat sur
prised at the delay. In the waiting throng
were Boss Kelly's lieutenants, John C.

cordiaL The boss maintained his position
in the center of the stage and Pendleton
went- forward to pay his respects to the

presently Assemblyman Butler, thrilled
by the spectacle, saw future victories and

the premature announcement and gazed
at John C Lynch and Jere Burke. In the

opportunity for an interview with Kelly,
and going forward said to the bcÂ«s:
"As all hats are taken off to you to
night in honor of your victory, tell me
how you accomplished the result."
"That would be a long story," remark
ed the boss, "but In a general way it can
be said that I succeeded because I knew
the' men to trust. I have lived in San
Francisco for many, many years. I am
reminded that Colonel Burns once sa'd
to me that his chief discouragement in
politics was the failure of men to keep
their sacred pledges. He asked me how
It happened that I was not deceived in

6imple. I said to him, 'Colonel Burns,
you are a strang-er, comparatively. In
San Francisco. I have lived here . many
years and grown up with- the people. I
do not give my confidence to a man un

â¢ Â«
BOSTON, Jan. 2.â "With but three Inches
to spare Kaser, the German, crossed, the
finish line In the lead in the last mile of
the day of racing at Park Garden Square.
Bobby Walthour, the Southerner, was his
closest competitor, and the last man In
the front lot was not ten yards In the
rear. The distance at the end of the day
was Â£82 miles 4 laps.
The day brought one retirement, that of
Gouffo Hz, which was expected last night.
His leg will be In splints for a week or
two. There were no bad falls during the
day, and the riders seemed to be, in good
condition. Little Joe Downey's' showing
has been surprising. Fischer also did
heroic work. Few gpHls and easy g-olng
made a quiet day.
The thirtieth hour scores at the finish
of the third day were as follows: Kaser
Walthour, McLean, McEachern, Stlnson,
Downey and Fischer, each 582.4; Babcock

The morning session was called to order
at, 8 o'clock, the first hour being devoted
to the missionary lecture by George W.
Ije'avltt, traveling secretary of the Stu
dent Volunteer movement of. North
America, and the second to the two Bible
study classes conducted by E. T. Colton
of New York and C. V. Ilibbard of Chi
cago. A notable feature of these classes
Is the. marked interest shown by the stu
dents and the large number of attend
ants at each. This morning: Mr. Colton's
subject was "Personal Work," and that
of Mr. Hibbard was the absolute fearless
ness that Is necessary in Christian life.
At 10 o'clock the conference assembled
for the morning platform address, which
was delivered by President S. B. McCor
mick of Coe College, Cedar Rapids. Iowa.
Before the speaker was introduced, how
over, the conference passed unanimously
a resolution of sympathy to II. Â¦ W. Rose,
formerly international college secretary of
the Young Men's Christian Association,
who has conducted the two pre.cedlng Pa
cific Coast Students' conferences at this
place, and who now, Is dangerqusly ill of
typhoid fever la New York.
The topic of Or. McCormlck's discourse
was "The King and His Kingdom," and
the speaker opened with the statement
that it seemed a peculiarly fitting thing
and a thine that augurs well for the com
ing of the kingdom in the twentieth cen
tury that the tlrst days of the new cen
tury are being spent by so large a body
of Pacific Coast college men in learning
how best to serve their God.
A notable event to-day was the arrival
of John R. Mott of New York, general
secretary of the World's Christian Stu
dent Federation, and the reception that
was accorded him. Practically the entire
conference met him at the train and
after greeting -him with three rousing
cheers the students laid hold of the car
riage, into which he was conducted, and
from which the horses had been taken,
and dragged It all the way up town to
El Carmelo Hotel. Mr. Mott addressed
the conference at its evening session.

a "killinV' on the gelding when he won

run loose. Er.os managed to beat the big
bunch away from, the post, and. never
competed to hang out any distress .sig

I>uckoy. The favorite. Kingstelle, met
â¢with aJl sorts of bad racfng luck, finally
finishlngr a close third.
The cold and threatening weather
seemed to have no effect on the attend
ence, which was quite up to the average.
The books enjoyed an Inning, as four well
. backed choices met defeat-
After running -up a string of four
rtraJght victories Bill Garrett was finally
compelled to taiie Ills hat oft to Gold Or.
The latter horÂ£e. ridden by Jenkins,
surprised everybody by staying a mils
and in a drive getting the verdict by
a nose In l^O 1 *. In the bettins Garrett
Â¦was held a 1 to 2 chance, while the pricÂ«
kxainet Cold Of went frcm : to 7 to 2.

Less than a furlong from the wire Jen

thÂ»Â» decision. â¢ â¢.
" Much disappointment was expressed by
the admirers of Janice over the result of
the San Pablo handicap at one mile one
hundred yards.. Mouuce, who had the
.mount, was baiilv cut off and pocketed
on two distinct occasions, finally getting
through in time to be beaten two lengths
by the S to 5 favorite Flush of Gold, pi
loted by O'Cennor. Don LÂ«uis, a 25 to 1
shot, was landed in third ; place by Bu

Johnny Schorr discovered a soft spot In
the second event, a five and a half fur
long sprint, for Joe Frey. Six to five was
laid against the -colt, -and J. Miller got
him over the line an easy winner fro-m
Maresa, a S> to 1 outsider. El FoneÂ«, the
brother to Scarborough, raii an exceed
ingly good race; finishing third; well up.
In the -sprint which followed J. Miller
continued his good work by gftttijne to
the wire ahead of an ordinary field on
Bab, also from the Schorr stable. . Bob
gTrith's colt Marshal Neil had been heav
ily backed, to take this number, but

In the run through the stretch Bab

CARSON CITY,, -Nev.. Jan. 2.â Dan
Stuart, the promoter of the Corbett-Fitz-
Blmmons flght, arrived in this city yester
day. f In an interview he said that he was
hero' to arrange another flght. Stuart
claims ;. that . the .high license, law .of, Ne
vada prevents fakes such as are common
in Eastern cities. One point upQn.. which
Stuart was taciturn was the names of the
lighters he is to bring together. He said:
V'lt would not be policy for me to give
too many names at this time, for I am not
the only man in the field who would like
to bring some of the big' ones together,,
but Jeffries, barring some unforeseen ac
cident, will certainly make 'a trip
to Carson and I will furnish him with an
opponent that will be worthy of him and
one that will make a contest and will
bring a few people here to see them,"
"Will it be Fitzsimmons?"
Mr. Stuart's only reply was the re
mark that should Ruhlln make a good
showing against Jeffries a match between
Jeffries and. Fitzsimmons., would be a
hummer. Stuart would like to bring off
the fight the latter part of May or tho
first of June, preferably about the 25th of
the former month.

made himself the best liked. of any rider
who ever visited the other side. Last
season on the English turf he accepted
553 mounts, lost 410 and won 143. The crack
English rider. Sam Loales, was second

amassed a competency during the time
he has been in the saddle. . /".

a salary of $15,000, and will report to his
new employers, on April 5 next.
,â¢ For some time negotiations were pend
ing, and It was not until Monday that the"
arrangements were fully completed by
telegraph. Bullman's excellent work in
the saddle last season called forth much
praise from the critics and several big
stables made him tempting: offers. Th*>
firm of Burns & Waterhouse will prob
ably get first call on the crack rider, until
his departure for the East.
It was while riding- for Ed Purser and
"William Murry that Bullman's ability be
gan to attract attention. He went East
with the Cambridge stable horses, and
his resolute style or finishing soon earned
for hjm many friends. In the Croker-
McCarren stable are such well-known per

Colonel Padden and others. With these
Lieutenant Colonel George French Will

News of Another Serious
Revolution in Vene-
SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO. Jan. 2.â
Passengers who have arrived here on the
"D" line steamer Philadelphia from
La Guay-ra, December CO. says a serious
revolution has broken out in the Mara
caibo district cf Venezuela. They add
that the government troops have defeated
the rebels and arrested twenty of the
leaders. ; Another rising is reported to
have occurred In the vicinity of the Orin
oco.
The United States auxiliary cruiser
Scorpion left here yesterday to join- the
Hartford at La Guayra.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2. â Minister
Loomls at Caracas has advised the State
Department that the impending trouble
over the conflicting asphalt concessions
has been averted for the present.
There are no details in the Minister's
dispatch but it is gathered that he has in
duced the Venezuelan authorities to sus
pend arbitrary action looking toward the
ejectment of some of the concessionaries
until there can be had a calm, Judicial de
termination of the claims.
It is probable that the gunboat Hart
ford at La Guayra has been a potent In
fluence In bringing about the present stay
of proceedings.
Insurance Men Think She May Be
Derelict Seen Off Vancouver.
The overdue British ship Andrada is
causing great uneasiness in shipping and
insurance circles. She sailed from Santa
Rosalia in ballast for Portland 52 days
ago. On the 10th of December she was
oSt the Columbia River bar and Pilot Cor
dlner was placed aboard. It came on to
blow and the- big ship was driven nortii.
She had not been heard from since and
fears are expressed that the vessel re
ported bottom up off Vancouver Island is
the Andrada. It la just five years ago
since- 1>" Uritish ship Cadzow Forest took
a pilot a'uoard off the Columbia River and
â¢was driven to sea and has never been
heard froin since. A. dispatch from As
toria: says the revenue cutter Perry has
gone out to look for the missing ship,
but the chances are that if ; the expected
sputhwester comÂ£s up the Perry will have
to run back for shelter.
'The Andrada is well known in this port
and Captain Adams- has a host of friends
FEARS FOB, THE ANDRADA.
REPORTS of disasters along the
coast during'the recent hurricane
are still coming in, and now the
storm signals are flying for an
other southwester. Vessels in
distress are making port and another
schooner bottom up has been sighted off
the poast.
On December 23 a schooner bottom up
was. seen by the crew of the Sacramento
about forty-five miles off the UmpQua
River; on December 27 a ship bottom up
was sighted off Vancouver Island by the
Chilean bark Terhuco, and now a third
derelict, also .bottom up, has beÂ«i sighted
.forty-flve miles west by southwest off
Cape Mendocino.
The schooner W. F. Jewett arrived from
Astoria yesterday after a very quick run
of four days. Captain Johnson reports
tnat. on December 31, when thirty-five
miles west by southwest of Cape Mendo
cino he sighted a ve?sel bottom up. She
was about 130 feet long on the kÂ«*el and
stood up about 10 feet out of the water.
The wreck, supposed to be the. schooner
Joseph and Henry, sighted by the captain
of the Sacramento on December 23. was
about forty-five miles off Yaquina. so the
two wrecks werp only about 240 miles
apart. From this some people reason that
as there was an interval of eight days
between the two reports there may be
only one derelict. The prevailing winds
and the current would drive both of theni
north. Â¦ however, so that theory may be
all wrong. Further reports from incom
ing ships vill folve the mystery.

Alameda Still Further Delayed.
The mail steamer Alameda will not get
away for ' Honolulu, Pago Pago, Auck
land and Sydney until 8 p. m. to-day. She
was scheduled to sail Wednesday, but
owing to the non-arrival of the English
mail her departure was postponed until
2 p. m. to-day. The malls are still fur
ther delayed and another postponement is
necessary.
The German bark- Sainte Anna has ar
rived from Newcastle. Australia, after
meeting with very lively weather ninety
miles southwest of the Farallones. Cap
tain Bernier reports that he had a very
pleasant run across the Pacific until he
reached the coast of California. Then it
began to blow. A week ago, in a hcavv
northwest gale, the ship was thrown on
her beam ends. The forward house and
the skylights in the cabin were stove in.
part of the rail was carried away, tho
cabin was flooded and forecastle gutted,
several sails were blown away and two
of the starboard boards were carried
?way and much damage was done about
the deck. When the gale subsided Cap
tain Bernier laid his course for San Fran
cisco once more, arriving yesterday.
Sainte Anna In a Gale.
. The schooner R. .\V. Bartlett from New
Whatcom arrived at -San Pedro a few
days Ego after a very hard run of twenty
six days. In a letter to his owners Cap
tain Nelson says it was the hardest time
he had ever had; After- passing Flattery
they had heavy weather for two weeks
and during that time weathered two hur
ricanes. The barometer went down to
twenty-nine and for three days the
schooner was under a reefed mlzzen sail.
A foresail was put on the spanker, but
in an hour it blew out of the bolt ropes.
Then a drag was made of old lines and
fenders and put over the stern. Oil bags
were put over the sides and that helped
matters. All the fish and tar oil In the
vessel was used and a portion of the lin
seed oil also. The forecastle, galley,
donkey room and cabin were flooded and
the men had to ball out with buckets. For
â¢sixteen hours the top of the deck load
was in the water. The Bartlett will dis
charge at San Pedro and then come to
San Francisco.
Bartlett Was in Trouble.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mall
steamer Australia arrived from Tahiti
yesterday. She was a day behind t'me,
owing to strong: h*nd winds and a heavy
sea. Everything was. quiet at Papeete
when the mail boat left. The following
first and secowd class passengers came up
on her In addition to eleven In the steer
age:
G. T. Wright, C. E. Benjamin. J, Niebuhr.
J. Lamb I>cty. A. T. ilapp*lye. Â«. W. Andrus.
Captain Grclot. M. Mrataut, T. M. Stevenson.
Dr. Nelson of the Alameda has played
in hard luck ever since the mail hoat
reached port and now he says ho does not
care how f-oon t!ie steamship pets away.
The evening after the Alameda arrived
"Doc" went out to make a few social
calls with his wife. Whether he pulled
his purse out with his handkerchief or
whether he was robbed he cannot tell,
but when he reached home the purse was
gone and with it H20 in gold and green
backs. Yesterday he'. sent one of the
shin's boys after his laundry. The boy
came back and told him the laundry was
burned an hour before. All the doc
tor's white suits, shirts, collars and
cuffs, underwear and socks went up In
smoke ami last evening he was hunting
up a fresh supply in order to Ret to sea
to-night. Dr. Nelson thinks this Is about
enough hard luck for one trip and he la
anxious for the sailing hour to come.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.â The general ex- j
pectation among: Senators la that the ttrat j
few days of the time of the Senate after j
reconvening to-morrow will be devoted Â¦
to the consideration of the army reor- I
ganizatlon bill, but there is some dlsposi- i
tlon to make an arrangement for a divi
sion of time that will permit of the con
tinued presentation of the ship subsidy
bill during a part of >*ach day. i
When the committee on order of busi- I
ness representing the Republican side of !
the .Senate made the subsidy bill the regu- j
lar order' of business at the beginning o*
the present session there was an under- I
standing mat when the army bill should |
be presented for consideration me other ;
measures should be la.nl aside temporarily j
if considered necessary in order to secure j
the prompt passage of the army bill. |
There Is apparently a disposition on the I
part of some Senators partially to dlsre- â¢
gard thls~ agreement and the friends of
the subsidy Dill, moat of whom are also I
supporters of tne army bill, are tr^'ln*? i
to. secure an understanding- for confine- '
ment of ..the discuoSiu:: oi the aim. . utsl j
to the morning hour of the Senate's dally i
proceedings, giving the time each day i
after 2 o'clock to vhe subsidy bill. ' j
A meeting of the Committee on Military !
Affairs has been callÂ«d for to-morrow,
when the matter, of procedure probably
will be discussed and a decision reached
as to whether the committee shall ask
tor all the time of the Senate until Its j
bill Is disposed of or ior only part of It. j
Some members of the committee are dis- i
posed to divide time with me subsidy bill Â¦
for the present, but all Senators, regard- i
less of politics, consider the army bill ;
of pressing importance because of tlie i
fact that the time for which the volunteer
BOldlera In the Philippines were enlisted
has almost expired. Hence It is probable- I
that some arrangement will be reached
guarding against any Â»>iotracted delay on |
the military measure. While eompara
lively few of the opposition Senators will
vote for Ihe till, non? >t them appear will- j
ing to make any objection to Its early
consideration.
There has been a general surmise that
Senator Cockrell would offer a substitute
for the army bill, but he states to-day
I that he had no such intention, at the
same' time expressing his conviction that '
! the bill should be -oressed to early, dis
position because of the condition in the
Philippines. Cockrell expressed the opin
ion that the army bill would not be dis
cussed at great length unless there should
be at the tame time an attempt to carry
the subsidy bill almiÂ« with it. In that
event he thought it might be dlinVuli to
get the army bill through promptly. Tlw
opposition Senators generally will con
tent themselves- with an explanation of
fheir views on the army bill and will maku
no opposition to Its becoming a law.
There are still several speeches to be
made on the subsidy bill, but apparently
none of the promised bpeeches have been
prepared, so that Senator Hawley may
be able to go on uninterruptedly for some
time with the army bill, regardless of any
arrangements concerning the subsidy bill.
The House will probably dispose of tht
reapportionment bill this week, although
Chairman Burton of the River and Har
bor Committee is inclined to contest the
I right of way of the Census Committee.
! The reapportionment bill, carrying out as
J It does a constitutional reaulrement, is
a matter of higher privilege than an ap
propriation bill and if Chairman Hopklr.s
insists, it probably will be given priority.
Hopkins, however, mav yield if he flnJs
that any large proportion of the members
will not return from their holiday vaca
tion In time to vote upon the measure this
week. A determined <ight will be made
against his bill by members from States
which would lose representation under it
and Hopkins desires a full house v.-hen
the vote is taken. He is confident that
his measure will carry with a full attend
ance. In any event neither Hop':ins nor
Burton de3ires to proceed to-morrow, so
lhat the session to-morrow probably will
be brief and unimportant. On Friday
either the river and harbor bill .or the
reapportionment bill will be taken up.
If it should be the latter the expectation
Is that Us consideration will be completed
on Saturday. If the former, the length
of time to be consumed is problematical.

MISS FRANCES M. ANDERSON,
corresponding secretary of the
Higher Educational League,
writes from the "Astoria," Wash-
ington, D. C, the following:
"About two months ago I was iaksn
vsry ill with la grippe and was ob-
l.ged fopo to bed. Hock three bo!-
iles of Pzruna with very beneficial
results, and was able to leavs my bed
in a week and regained my usual
strength vzry soon.
"I hava nothing but praise for Fe-
runa and recommend it to those simi-
larly efflicied whenever I can." â
Francos M. Anderson.
La grippe is, strictly speaking, epidemic
catarrhâ that Is to say, a variety of acute
catarrh which is so contagious and runs
a course more or less definite, the same
as scarlet fever, whooping-cough, etc.
During the acute stages of 1 la grippe It
is not a very fatal disease, but the condi-
tion in which it leaves the system has
caused the dcatlÂ»-^f-a countless number.
Indeed, nearly every person who has
had la grippe within the last three years
finds himself more or less deranged by the
pernicious effects of this disease. The
majority of those who have escaped death
flnd life scarcely worth living.
If this vast multitude of people could
only know with what certainty and
promptness Peruna would relieve them
of all the bad effects which la grippe- has
brought upon them, what an untold
amount of suffering would be averted!
Thousands have already heard h6w
quickly this remedy will cure In these*
ca^es and have been saved; but tens off
thousands have not yet h6ard, and con-
tinue to suffer on. dropping into the grave
one by one.. Â¦â¢
Peruna cures catarrh In all stages and
varieties, whether acute cr chronic, and
is therefore the most effective remedy
ever devised for removing al! the derange-
ments which follow la grinr*.
Samuel M. Y.ork writes from Union
Grove. Ala., the following 1 letter:
Dear Sirâ "La?t week I was taken with
la grippe and catarrhal deafness. I wrote
you for advico ar.d followed your direc-
tions. After taking: two bottles of Pera-
na I found myself well of la grippe, and
my hearinsr was fu!!y restored. My health
is better than it has been in five years.*
"My wife improved in health very much
after taking Peruna."â Samuel M. York.
Miss Caroline J. Kahl. Otisco, Ind..
â¢writes as follows:
"Three years I had la grippe and
pulmonary trouble. I was vsry sick.
I had hemorrhages of the lungs
nearly every day for a year, and
tkrze bottles of your Peruna cured
me. The doctor said I had consump-
tion. I am now in better health than
I have bsen fcr many years. '."Â¦*..
"I highly recommend Peruna to all my
neighbors and friends. Peruna Is my fa-'
vcrite medicine. I shall always have Pe-
runa In the house."â Misa Caroline J:
Kahl. :

One of the enterprising New York weeklies has
announced to 'the public that it will do adman's read
ing for him and furnish- him information on every
tcpic of the time thoroughly digested; and the offer
will be attractive to persons who do. not like to read,
but we advise all persons who wish to keep posted to
take a daily newspaper aad do their own reading.
LONDON authorities have estimated that the
contributions and bequests for charitable
purposes in the United Kingdom during
the closing year of the century would amount to
about $20,000,000. That sum is larger than the aver
age.of annual contributions for such purposes, owing
partly to several large bequests, but mainly to the de
mands for charity made by the war in South Africa
and the famine in India. x
How much has been given by will or otherwise for
charity in this country has not so far as we know been
computed with anything like accuracy. It would
doubtless fall far short of the amount devoted to that
purpose in Great Britain, for, fortunately, we have a
population so generally prosperous it is very rare
that any large charitable donations are called for.
The altruism of Americans flows in many directions
other than that of charity. It shows itself mainly in
contributions for education in one form or another,
and founds or endows libraries, art galleries, museums
c f science, colleges and universities.
The Chicago Tribune, which keeps a list of large
contributions of the kind, reports that the total con
tributions for charity and education in one form v or
another during the year in this country amount to
about $60,000,000. It is to be borne in mind that sum
is made up only of contributions of $1000 or more,
and does not include all that Americans have given for
such purposes. Furthermore, the sum is about $20,
000,000 less than that which was donated for similar
purposes last year.
According to a summary of the figures given by
'the Tribune, almost exactly half of the donations of
the current year have been made to educational insti
tutions, and half of the $30,000,000 has been received
by thirty-six of the larger colleges and universities.

A FAMILY OF STATESMEN.
WHEN Lord Salisbury met Parliament in special
6ession after the reorganization of his Cabinet
following the general election, it will be re
membered that Rosebery congratulated him on hav
ing so many statesmen in his family. The sarcasm of
the remark was not lost upon the British public, and
there has been ever since a running fire of criticism
and condemnation upon the Prime' Minister for
putting so many members of his family into his -Min
istry.
In one of these criticisms a member of Parlia
ment stated that the Cecil family is now drawing up
ward of Â£17,000 a year "from a. generous but un
consenting cotintry." The accuracy of the statement
was challenged, and to justify it the London Chronicle
published the following list of offices held and salaries
drawn by the Premier and his kinsmen: l
Lord Salisbury (Lord Privy Seal)... Â£2000
A. J. Balfour (nephew) (First Lord of the Treasury) 5000
Lord Selbome (son-in-law) (First Lord of the Ad
miralty) ' 4553
Gerald Balf our (nephew) (President of the Board
of Trade)..... 2000
Lord Cranborne (son) (Under Secretary for For
eign Affairs) .... 'â I J500
The Chronicle adds: "These- figures, it will be
seen, total iiSflSO, the amount we gave roughly in our
leading article of * yesterday. In order, therefore, to
arriyc at the Â£17,000 of Mr. Bartley, it would be neces
sary to, include the sum received by Lord William
Cecil as rector of Bishop's St. Etheldreda, Hatfield,
which, according to the clergy list, is Â£1432 gross and
Â£975 net. It is only fair to point out, however, thai
the patron of the living is the Marquis of Salisbu-y
himself."
It is to be noted that while the grant of so many
positions in the. Ministry to' members of, the family
of the Prime Minister has aroused criticism and com
ment in Great Britain, there has been nothing that
shows any outburst of public indignation. The'peo
ple appear to have become accustomed to -support
aristocratic families and princes, and to look upon
Salisbury's action as a novelty more than anything
elseâ but what a ' howl about , "nepotism" would go
up in this country should a President of the United
States' place so many of his kinfolks in high office
at big salaries.

THE SHIPPING BILL
QN reassembling: after the holiday recess it is
exacted that Congress will give- active atten
' tion to the trill, for encouragement of Ameri
can ships a:i4.'5iiij>-buildir.g.
/ It is evident that powerful influences are at work
ggair.st the measure, and that they are all the more to
be Teared' because their opposition is indirect. The
Merchants' Association of New York is in con
troversy with the Senate Committee on .Commerce
over the" bilL Professing to favor some such general
measure, the association antagonizes the feature of the
till giving admission to American register, and half
Eubsidj, to foreign built steamers. This controversy
drew a letter "from Senator Frye, chairman of the
Senate Committee on Commerce, in which he ex
plainedthat that feature of the bill is for the purpose
of immediately .establishing an American trans-
Atlar.tic line. The owners of such foreign built ton
nage are by the bill required to build as much Ameri
can as they -own of foreign built tonnage, compelling
the duplication o{ their passenger and freight facili
ties. This is denounced by. the-; association as class
legislation. In the correspondence is revealed inad
vertently what may be the- ulterior view of the asso
ciation. Its representative, Mf. Duval, in his com
munication to Senator Frye, says that, "For strictly
commercial purposes, however, the benefit of Ameri
can tonnage tinder the American flag is distinctly
sentimental.* \VÂ« do not. agree with that view, and
Â¦we think the New York Merchants' Association is in
error. ;It is no more a sentimental matter' than any
other measure designed for the protection of Ameri
<zzi interests- and the conservation of the energies of
our people for their own benefit Instead of being
sentimental it is intensely practical. . An American
company already owning foreign built steamers, if
compelled to duplicate itstonnage by American buil:
ships in .order to receive any. benefit from the law,
is certainly in, a better position to proceed to the em
ployment of American ship-builders and the use of
American material than would the case of a new and
inexperienced company to be.. organized and enter a
field where it has no existing activities nor past exV
perience.- The purpose -61 that -feature is to encour
age the enterprise of our countrymen already engaged
in ocean .carrying and to get immediate results.
We fear that the denunciation of. the idea of Ameri
,can freight under .the Americas flag- as merely senti
mental means that among -the merchants of New
"York there is- but little desire to change from depen
dence., on' foreign to the- independence that will be
.stimulated by the building of American ships.- We
fear this ,in spite of the concurrent profession of the
association that it favors the* general proposition.
The president of the .association, Mr. William F.
King, in. a reply to Senator Frye's letter, says: "We
do not believe, however, that a subsidy bill is so neces
sary as to warrant the granting <jf power to a few to
oppress commerce, and we 'dp not believe that any
legislation "is so important or urgent as to sustain a
charge of class legislation and all the 'adverse senti
ment tsrh-ich that will evoke."
Does it not appear that Mr. King understands the
tactical value of calling a thing by a bad name for the
purpose of enlisting prejudice to oppose it?
His letter would- b- a' stronger appeal to reason if
he had explained how commerce can be oppressed
By compelling an American company to duplicate its
tonnage by American construction, thus doubling the
facilities of commerce, before that company can touch
or enjoy a dollar of subsidy. â¢
He makes the statement and omrts its proof, be
cause it cannot be proved.

QUEEN WILHELMINA'S DUKE
IS A NOTABLE LADY KILLER
Ldttlo Queen Wilhelmlna's selection of a husband Is the least handsome of
the brothers Mecklenburg-Schwerln, saj ; s a correspondent of the Baltimore
American. .
Gossips whisper that the Duke was taken by surprise and yet It was not
the first time. In spite of being a good deal of a detrimental, that he has*
been admired by royal ladles. Everybody knows, says the exchansre. that
when pretty Princess Helena of Russia suddenly broke her engagement with
Max of Baden it was because she hoped to persuade her parents to let her
marry the stout blonde young duckling: whom tVilhelmlna has. selected; and
the youngest daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh has loved the Duke In vain.
In short, Helnrlch of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Is a good deal of a lady killer,
and he knows it. Fat and plain of face and, for a royal person, distinctly
poverty stricken, he has a fascination for womankind, the sort of fascina
tion that there Is no use trying to explain, because it is not perceptible to
any but the persons fascinated. V,
One of the men who possessed this faculty to a most surprising degree
was Napoleon Bonaparte's rival in the affections of Marie Louise, the in
famous and all-powerful Neipperg. He was an ugly creature, with small abil
ities, and yet smaller fortune, and he had broken many hearts about the
Austrian court before Marie Louise saw and tell furiously In love with him.
With everything to lose and nothing to gain by her encouragement of the
man, she left no stone unturned until she was able to make' herself Xelp
perg's -wife. In the eyes of the world it was a terrible degradation for the
widow of the French Emperor to become the wife of an Austrian Count, but
she cared not a whit what the world said, as was the case with the women
who ran after tbe ugly spendthrift Wilkes and the mad Due de Richelieu.
Wllkes was famous in his day all over England, not only as Lord Mayor
and Chamberlain and a very loud talking patriot but as the ugliest man of
his time and the most admired by the women. He flouted and ill treated all
of them, with the exception of his daughter, but it had -not the desired ef
fect of cooling their affections. As to the Due de Richelieu, though men could
not tolerate him, when he was shut Up in the Bastllf* crowds of women, old
and young, rich' and poor, used to collect every day at the hour when he took
his exercise on the parapets and adore him from a distance, and deplore the
incarceration of so. charming a person. Â¦!â¢;Â¦ -â¢"Â»;
Theodore Hook^ras another ugly man who was Irresistible to the softer
sex, for it is proven clearly that when a man Is agreeable to women they
care'nofMnjthe least what his personal appearance may be. Liszt proved
this; when an* old man, with a hard, ugly face, women begged permission
to kiss his ugly hands and raved and sentimentalized over him as though
he was Adonis' self. Dozens of school girls and Countesses who worshiped at
his shrine cared not a pin for his music, nor understood a note of It, but were
keenly alive to the charm of his personality, which no woman, so far as we
know, was ever able or willing to withstand.

THE NATURAL GAS SUPPLY.
ONE of the industrial advantages enjoyed by
certain portions of the United States during
the latter part v of the last century will probably
pass quickly away in the new. The natural gas supply,
which was at one time supposed to be almost inex
haustible, is vanishing, and unless what remains be
carefully conserved some districts now enjoying- the
advantage of that form of fuel and light will be speed
ily deprived of it.;
Data compiled by the United States Geological
Survey show that during the year 1899 the amount
of natural gas utilized in different parts of' the coun
try was about 108,000,000,000 cubic feet, estimated to
have a fuel value equal to something more than 4,000,
000 tons of coal. It is 6tated that to maintain such a
rate of consumption for more than a year or two
longer will involve opening new fields of supply and
shifting, enlarging and extending thousands of miles
of pipe.
Out of the diminution of the supply there has come
a nice little wrangle between the officers of the In
dianapolis Gas Company and the gas consumers of
the city. In a recent report to the stockholders it
was announced that the directors would have to de
fer action upon the question of dividends. The re
port went on to say the company has' been selling
natural gas in Indianapolis by contract without meter
measurements, being of the belief that the supply was
unlimited; the result has been a great deal of waste
in the use of gas, and "notwithstanding the fact that
\ye have expended large sums of money in new wells,
pump stations and additional pipe lines in the field,
for the purpose of bringing a greater volume of gas
to the city, it has. been found impossible to furnish
a satisfactory service so long as the present wasteful
use of gas is continued."
Had the officers res)ed their case at that point there
would probably have been no protest from the peo
ple further than was required to oppose an introduc
tion of the meter system. The report, however, went
on 'to accuse the citizens 6f something worse than
wasting gas. It was said: "In spite of existing pro
hibitory statutes a large percentage of our customers
have unlawfully increased their supply by the prac
tice known locally as 'boring out' their mixers.
Every effort has been made by your managers to stop
this unlawful wastage, but although the bes^t legal tal
ent has been employed, supported by indisputable
proofs, it has been found utterly 'impossible to secure
a conviction, because of the fact that this illegal prac
tice has been 60 generally indulged in. These vio
lators of the law are not confined to the poor or
vjcious, but include city and county buildings, city
officials, lawyers, churches, ministers of the gospel,
physicians, architects and some of the most prominent
residents and business houses in the city of Indian
apolis." ,
That "charge of an offense which virtually amounts
to stealing has been vigorously denounced as a whole
sale libel upon the citizens. Whether it be true or
false cannot be decided at this distance. It will be
noted the statement itself admits the impossibility of
convicting anybody of the offense. It appears, there
fore, that the cause of all the trouble is the decreasing
supply of the gas. With the diminution in the source
of supply there is a corresponding diminution in the
pressure and the flow. Consequently consumers have
to resort to various devices to obtain as much gas as
they did when their contracts were made.
The only interest outsiders have in the controversy
fs the evidence it affords of the decline in natural gas
supply. "Communities which have had advantages
over others by reason of that form of cheap and con
venient fuel will now have to compete in manufactur
ing without that advantage. As a consequence there
may be a considerable shifting of manufacturing plants
within the next few years, and the natural gas towns
and -cities may lose some of their most important in
dustries. â¢ ; "*â¢ ,l.-,r

The Methodist twentieth century thank offering has
enriched educational institutions by $3,142,532. Li
braries have received about $6,560,000, mostly for new
buildings. Of this sum Andrew Carnegie has given
$4,195,000 within the year. Charities have received
$13,390,176, which is a little more than in 1899.
Churches and church enterprises have received $8,799,
605, which is $6,000,000 more than the year before.
It willbe seen the old century has set .the. new a
good example in the way of liberality and charity in
America and Great Britain; norvcan it be doubted
that a showing equally creditable would be made for
other civilized nations were the * extent of their con
tributions known. These virtues are manifest where
ever the higher forms of humanity exist, and, fortu
nately, the manifestations are increasing with the
years.
THE State institutions of California are adminis
tered by directors and trustees, who. serve with
out pay. In the case of most of them provision
Is made for payment of their actual expenses when on
duty. Every public institution, from the university
to the Home for the Feeble-minded, is managed, ad
ministered and controlled by citizens who give to the
public, free of cost, their time and such attention as
they can bestow. This implies an admirable public
spirit on their part, for which they deserve the good
will of the people. There are occasional failures of
excellence in management, and there have been rare
instances of carelessness and perhaps corruption â
cases in which an unsalaried director or trustee has
been willing to profit him6elf out of his office. But
these- lapses have been so infrequent as not to supply
any argument against the general system. .As com
pared with the well salaried Harbor Commission, the
unsalaried boards of State institutions stand in con
spicuous and honorable contrast. This seems to prove
that the payment of salaries is no safeguard against
improper use of official opportunity. We do not in
tend that this illustration shall- apply specifically to the
existing Harbor Commission, which seems to be
equal to the best of its predecessors, but to the many
scandals that have stained that part of the public ad
ministration in the past.
For years a proposition has been in the air for the
creation of a State Board of Charities and Correc
tions. An act creating such a board was passed hy
the last Legislature and sustained a pocket veto by
the Governor.
The subject has since been agitated, and the propo
sition is expected to take shape at the meeting: of the
State Association of Charities and Corrections to be
held in Oakland next Friday.
As far as the plan has crystallized it calls for a bi
partisan bod}-, unsalaried, but with a paid secretary,
who will naturally become the executive officer of the
board and will really do the business assigned to it.
This board will neither appoint officers and employes
of the State institutions, nor* purchase their supplies,
but will have a visitorial and supervisory function. It
will have oversight of the directors and' trustees of
the institutions, enforce a common system of keeping
books and accounts, and will recommend to the Leg
islature the appropriation actually required for the
institutions under its jurisdiction. Every one who has
experience in the management of punitive, eleemosy
inary and correction work will see that a board with
such functions can be of genuine service.
Two things must be kept in sight in the operation
of -every public institution. One is its work in the
line of the purpose for which it exists, and the other
is the business economy of its administration. On
every local board of trustees and directors there
should be some member, or members, whose knowl
edge and sympathies are with the purpose of the in
stitution which they manage. On the Board of Re
gents of the University should be members who cher
ish, from experience, a proper ideal of university
work. The Normal schools are benefited by the pres
ence of trustees who know about the teaching of
teachers, who know that not every scholar can teach,
and that the ability to impart knowledge does not
necessarily go with its possession. On every direc
tcry for the insane should be some who are in touch
with the latest conclusions of science in the treatment
of mental alienation. The State schools for incorri
gible juveniles should be very carefully officered;
their directories should be men and women wise in
the ways of salvation to good citizenship of the
young, who have been too early perverted by neglect
and bad training. Now all men of experience know
that such individuals may be far less expert in busi
ness than in the humane specialties which equip them
for properly administering an institution in line with
its purpose. For that reason the merely business
oversight may often be usefully given to such a
board as is proposed. But such a board should have
nothing to do with patronage or purchases. Its duty
should be the enforcement of business economies
upon the local trustees and directors. To give it
patronage_and the purchase of supplies would surely
lead to corruption, and as surely to the injury of the
institutions, and to their diversion from their 'pur
pose.
Impinged upon this proposition is another that may
well be considered. The auditing and allowance of
the bills of the State institutions are now done by the
Board of Examiners, consisting of the Governor and
other State officers. The duty is imposed upon them
by statute. The constitution defines the duties of
these officers, and those of the Board of Examiners
are not among them. With the multiplication of State
institutions the business of the board has^risen until
it nearly submerges th.e ex-officio members who com
pose it. It is proposed to make the new Board of
Charities and Corrections a Board of Audit of these
thousands of accounts, relieving the Governor and
other officers of a duty that is a burden when added
to their constitutional functions. In that shape we
are not prepared to deny that there is merit in the
plan for this addition to the machinery of the State.
But if it take the shape of a purchasing and patron
age agency, only evil will result from it.

"No room for hundreds."
"There were admirers of Vienna waltz
music sitting en the sieps. and that there

Such, culled from the New Yo/k Herald,
was the tale of the Strauss* nights in
The play was a distinct triumph
for the clever actress who assumed the
leading role, and Borne opportunities were
given to the members of the company to
present carefully studied characters.
The name of .the adapter of the inci
dents in the life of Nell Gwynne was npt
given In the programme, but it is learned
that Miss Charlotte Thompson Is the au
thor' MUs Thompson has delved into
English history and. while her play is
not a great one, it shows many Incidents
during the time that England was under
the sway of the "Merry Monarch.'" The
first act introduces Nell Gv.-ynne as the
poor orange girl of "Old Drury." who is
beloved by Jack Churchill, the dashing
soldier who founded the house of Marl
borough. ,The love interest, which is
vital to a play of the kind, presented last
evening, was cut f#iort In the first act.
"Nell Gwynne" is shown as a true
hearted Irish girl, willing to help her old
friends, but the character as drawn by
Miss Thompson Is not the Noll Gwynne
whom Charles the Second idolized. The
banter of the court and the stage Is well
portrayed, but the scene in which Nell
Gwynne "holds up" the royal coach In or
der to give Churchill a chance to distin
guish himself is weak and trivial. The.
five acts simply display the transition of
the poor -orange girl to the prominent
actress nnd court favorite and the play
ends with the eulogium on Nell's good
qualities pronounced by the King.
Miss Roberts was a merry, daBhing and
good-hearted Nell and he.r scenes, in
which she dons male attire, were artistic
ally played. The great charm of Miss
Roberts is that Bhe never ovemcts.Â»'How
ard Scott did not have as great oppor
tunity as Charles, but enacted the role
with finesse. Lucius Henderson made a
manly Churchill and Clarence Montalne.
Carlyle Moore, George Webster and
Frank Bacon were distinguished in^ the
male members of the cast. Miss Kitty
Belmere had but little to do as Mistress
Hughes, an actress, but did that little
well. Lorena Attwood, Marie Howe and
Polly Stockwell also played effectively the
roles entrusted to them. The costumes
and scenic effects were by far the best
ever Been at the Alcazar. The long waits
between the acts were enlivened by the
pleasing music of the orchestra.

The Hoffmans went to Skaguay four
years ag-o, the wife practically supporting
the husband the greater part of the time.
Lately she left him and went to live in a
Skaguay boarding house. Hoffman tried
to get her to return, without avail. On
the n orning of the tragedy the woman
went to the cottage where her husband
was living to feed the chickens, she be
lieving him absent. He happened to be
at home, and after watching her feed the
chickens he opened lire on her with a

Captain Healy got letters with the partic

mation to any one. The new strike is
thought to bo near Tanana. A whole
sale stampede <s probable.'!
When tlÂ«e two minors who discovered
the rich digghiRS unearthed the golden
gTavel thc-y were short of provisions and
Dnahlo to remain aÂ». thfir discovery. They
spent nne day thf-re, nnd washed out more
than $TjOO In coarse gold. Then they start
ed fo~ the coast, going to Valdes for pro
visions, on procuring which they returned
to their find. They reported at Valdes
that a groat stampede had occurred from
the other portions of the Tanana to Snake
C reek before ihey loft. It was doubtless
from one of the stampeders that the news
was received up the Yukon and tele
graphed to the coast before the arrival
there of the discoverers of the mines.
Constable J. J. Hamilton of the North
west Mounted Polico, who arrived by the
Amur from Dawson, reports that before
ne left there Constables Gardner and
Linkleader returned to the Dawson bar
racks from the finds in the Stewart River
district. The constable says that they
were enthusiastic in regard to the rich
ness of the find3 there. Mr. Matherson,
who has a Btoro at Clear Creek, also re
turned and from him, too, the constable
learned of the richness of the diggings.
The policemen and storekeeper said that
there were not move than fifty men in
the Clear Creek country when they left
there, about half of whom were prospect
ing and the others hunting. NÂ»t - more
than six or eight claims were being
â¢worked. It Is very iiard to get provisions
in and the hunters were finding a big
sale for their game.
VICTORIA. Jan. 2.â The steamer Amur,
which reached here to-day from Alaska,
brings news that the richest discovery
made in the North since the Klondike has
.lust been made in the American Yukon
and it will be to the new diggirtgs, which
are nenr th? Tanana, that the great stam
pede of the coming year will take place
over the Copper River trail. The
gravels found In this new creek, which
Â¦hn<= been named Snake Creek, are said to
give an average of $14 to the pan.
The nrwi? comes from two sources, from
Values and from Dawson. At the former
place it was learned from two Americans,
who had been prospecting in the Tanana
country and were on their way out to the
coast for the winter, bound from the
Tanana to Valdes when they made their
rich find. From Dawsor. the news is
eiven In the following dispatch, which
was wired by the Dawson correspondent
of tli? Skaguay Alaskan on December 20:
"The greatest strike since the discovery
of the Klondike set the world mad is re
ports from the American Yukon. The
news was brought by mail carriers, who
fay the diggings average $14 to the pan.
The particulars are meaner, but the news
has created great excitement which pre
vails the Â¦whole length of the Yukon River.
The most famous of all the pl&yhouses
with which Shakespeare was connected
was the Globe on the Bankslde. It was
buiit In 15*39 by Richard and Cuthbcrt Bur
bage. sons of old James, and themselves
actors and theater-owners. Their lease
of the ground on which the theater was
built expired in 1597, and, though allowed
to continue playing there, they became in
volved in a lawsuit with its owner. The
city authorities, too, -were pressing hard
upon them, and finally they took a des
perate sup, tore down the theater, trans
ported its materials across the Thames,
and there in an open space amid a grove
of trees they constructed the playnouse
that was to remain forever associated
with Shakespeare's name. It stood upon
a circular substructure of brick or stone,
through which two doors opened, one to
the yard where the common herd went
at a penny apiece to see and Judge their
penny's worth, and the other to the tir
ing room of the actors, through which not
only they but the noble patrons of the
drama, the poets and their friends ob
tained admission to the stage Itself.
The stage, a rectangular wooden struc
ture, supported on strong posts, projected
well forward into the circular yard, so
that the actors were seen, not from the
front only as to-day, but from every side.
Behind the stage and a little above it waa
a recess, or alcove, which could be shut
off with a curtain, and which served at
need as a second stage, a study, a bed
room or a tent. Here the couch of Des
demona or of Juliet was placed, here the
actors in "Hamlet" performed the play
which brought hi? guiit home to Claudia*,
and here on occasion a King's throne
would be placed while his vassals grouped
about him on the steps below. Over the
alcove projected a balcony, which in its
turn played many partsâ Juliet's window,
the wall of a besieged, city or the deck of
a storm-tossed ehip. The stage itself was
partly roofed over- with a structure tech
nically known as the heavens, which was
draped with blue hangings for comedy,
with black when tragedy was to be per
formed. The yard was open to the sky,
and it speaks volumes for the rapt inter
est of the Elizabethans in the drama that
they wrre content to stand here in hun
dreds for hours at a lime, exposed to ail
the inclemency of a London winter.
Around the yard ran tralleries with seats,
to which that part of the audience which
disliked equally the nOise and Jostling of
the yard and the expense and publicity
of the stage withdrew. These gal
leries were covered with a roof of thatch â
a circumstance which in the end proved
the destruction of the Globe. Upon the
roof was a little hut 4rom which a herald
emerged to proclaim by three blasts of a
trumpet that flÂ» play was about to begin.'
Over all rose a flagstaff, from which cm
play days floated a banner with the sign
of the theater. Hercules bearing the globe.
The performances began early in the af
ternoon, at 3 o'clock, or even earlier, and
lasted some two or three hours. It Is es
timated that the Globe might contain
when packed to the uttermost some two
thousand spectators.
In this theater Shakespeare s greatest
plays were first produced. We know that
"I>ear." "Othello," and "Macbeth," "Trol
lus and Cressida," "Pericles" and "The
Winter's Tale" were brought out at the
Globe, and it is a fair inference that his
most charming comedy, "As You Like It."
and his* greatest tragedy, "Hamlet," with
the three Roman playn. may also be In
cluded in this list. All these were written
in that astonishing decade of Shake
speare's life from 1600 to 1610, when his
company made the Globe their usual play-
Ing house. After that date they performed
alternately at Blackfriars and at the
Globe until the destruction of the latter
by fire in 1613. This accident also Is con-
The Globe.

at the conflagration. Two yeara previous- .
ly he had withdrawn to Stratford-on-Avon>
and settled down as a quiet burgher, llv- .
ing on the handsome property that hl3
profits as an actor end playwright had- â¢
enabled him to acquire. In a. dee<l of salo
bearing the date of 1613 he is Â«UÂ»?!cribed
as of Stratford-on-Avon, gentleman. He .
*ttll continued to furnish his company
with plays, but his best work was done.
W> note in his later dramas a CRreless- .
ness of construction and a frank disregard
of probabilities which contrast strongly
with the superbworkmanship of "Othello"
and "Lear. And we seem to detect a
certain loss of Interest in Shakespeare's
Increasing habit during- these later years
of collaborating with an Inferior drama
tist In this way it seems evident that
"Tlmon." "Pericles" and the "Two Noble
Kinsmen." all works of this period were
composed. "King Henry VIII". itself was
only In part the work of Shakespeare.
The Audience.
It seems fitting to close this study with
a brief note on the audiences before â
'which Shakespeare's plays were per
formed. Nearly every writer on the Eliz
abethan drama has spoken of the noisy
mob that filled the yard, eating; drinking 1 .
shouting for the clown, at times even
pelting the actors with apple cores and
other more offensive mlsalleq. Certainly
the mob seems a disturbing element, and
hardly less eo the fashionable gentlemen
seated on the stage itself, who smoked
lon^: pipes, spread out their fine cloaks
to dazzle the public, chatted familiarly
with the actors between their parts and
set themselves up for critics who could
make or break an author. Jotting down
the be9t lines of hla play in their note
books, growling "vile" and "filthy" at
passages which displeased them, or even
leaving the stage in the mid3tor the per
formance to mark the utterness of their
disgust. Yet with all its faults the Eliza
bethan audience w^is an instrument for
the dramatist to play upon, such as had
not existed since all Athens gathered to
gether to watch a solemn trilogy of
AeschylU3 or a boisterous farce of Aris
tophanes. It was extraordinarily sensi
tive, receptive, responsive. All classes, '.
from the outcasts of the street to the
peers about the throne, met there togeth
er In pursuit of a common pleasure. No .
Kulf In matters of esthetic appreciation
existed then, such as now sends one audi
ence to the grand opera and another to
the vaudeville. Shakespeare had the na
tion at his disposal. And in Shakespeare's
day. in spite of .the growing strength of .
Puritanism, the nation was still Merry
England. The people loved their old
sports and games, the mumming and the
morris dance, the swordplay and wrest
ling. They were not cruel, but they de
lighted in fierce action and the flow of
blood as seen in the baiting of bulls and
bears. They were full to the brim of that
spirit of adventure which found expres
sion in the battles, voyages and explora
tions "of Raleigh, Drake and Froblsher;
and they had an almost barbaric passion
for splendid spectacles, gorgeous raiment .
and costly Jewels. Yet they had at the
same time higher and finer tastes. They
were passionately fond of music, which
played a part In their lives such as we
can hardly conceive to-day. They delight
ffl in the exercise of wit. even, when wit
made a plaything of language itself. And
they were a l.atlon of poets â the whole
land, free from the chains of the past,
sung together in the Joy of the new life.
No such outburst of poetry 13 known to
literature as that which took place in the
later years of Elizabeth's reign. And all
these sports, desires and passions met to
gether In the romantic drama. Here was
the food the people soughtâ rough horse
play of the clowns fierce swordplay of
the heroes, jigs and dances, songs and
music, action and adventure, splendid
pageant and gorgeous costumes, and over
all and enshrining all the matchless
poe'try of Shakespeare. What did it mat
ter to his hearers that the stage was bare.

"I do not feel very well, I am so
tired all the time. I do not know what
is the matter with me."
You hear these wcrds every day ; as
often as you meet your friends just 60
often are these words repeated. More
than likely you speak the same signifi-
cant words rourself. and no doubt you
do feel far fVorn well most of the time.
Mrs. Ella Rice, of Chelsea, Wis.,
whose portrait we publish, writes that
she suffered for two years with bear-
ing-down pains, headache, backache,
and had all kinds of miserable feeling-B,
all of which was caused by falling and
inflammation of the womb, 'and after
doctoring with physicians and numer-
ous medicines she was entirely cured by
Mr*. Ella Rick
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound.
If you are troubled with pains,
fainting spells, depression of spirits!
reluctance to go anywhere, headache,
backache, and always tired, pleaae re-
member that there is an absolute
remedy which will relieve you of your
Buffering as it did Mrs. Rice. Proof
is monumental that Lydia E. Pink-
haxnV Vegetable Compound is the
greatest medicine for suffering women.
No other medicine has made the cures
that it has*, and no other woman has
helped so many women by direct advice
as has Mrs. Pinkham ; her experience
is greater than that of any living per-

NEW YORK. Jan- 2.â To-day's stock mar
ket opened with an upward rush of prices and
closed with something very like a slump and
with the lift ln a very ragged condition ln the
matter" of net changes.' The professional bear
traders, who had matched the market for days
to detect the expected turning point toward
reaction, fell . upon the market to-day with
vigor. But the professional bear operators have
mader many mistakes ln the last few weeks
and opinion Is sreatly divided to-night as to
whether thefr time has come. Certainly the
market ' to-day Bhowcd an astonishingly large
demand for etocks and ln the early dealings
the supply -was sufficiently limited to cause a
volatile upward epurt of prices ln a number
of stocks. The general level of the market
was In fact lifted so considerably as to offer
very â¢ attractive profits even on a day's turn
and & coral durable volume of the selling was
undoubtedly due to the profit-taking. The rea.1-
Szlnjr was .well absorbed. If regarded from the
standpoint' of buyers of stocks on Monday, but
relapse* from the high prices to-day, at which
there was a considerable volume of purchases,
makes a. disappointing result fÂ»r those who
trot ln at the high level. The market must
al5o be considered In connection with the pos
itive elements of weakness which developed.
ThÂ« violent break. ln Sugar was docldedly dis
turbing and had more effect lhan similar
rtreaJcs have had ln the Immediate past. This
e'tock. waji pushed up IVi thlÂ« mornhig on the
published rejiorts that the proposed advance
in. the price of package coffee was the fore
runner of a rottk-mcnl of the sugar trade war.
-which has been a puzzle to Wall street for
many months. This- corfortlng assurance for
holders of tujrw certificates received a rude
chock from the announcement which quickly
followed of a cut ln the price of granulated
sugar by the American Company, which was
followed by the other companies, bringing the
pric*Â» by all to the tame basis. As the Amer
ican Company hajt been holding its price abovo
that of the other companlf-e, the bringing of
price* to the same basis is'allegpd to be equiv
alent to a â¢ettlempnt. But this did not avail

on that market was strong. The initial selling
met with a demand more than adequate to take

there was investment buying on a large scale

an advance of 6d ln flour at Liverpool and by a

the yards and the fact that there were no
deliveries on January contracts. There was
little outside support, however, and selling by
peckers caused a reaction. The close was only
fairly Ftendy. May pork and lard a shade down
and ribs unchanged.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The Chicago market was excited
and irregular, with a large general trade, al
most purely speculative. The feeling was nerv
ous and some millions of bushels changeM
hards. There was large short covering by St.
Louis, but the Northwest sold freely, presum
ably against Minneapolis purchases. All com
mispion houeps had plenty of orders. Every
body expects a reaction. New York opened at
S2V4c. advanced to 84c and fell back to S2"jc.
The f?an Francisco call market opened higher,
but fell back, as will be eeen. Shipping quota
tions? were acain advanced.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were moderate in volume of
business and Irregular to-day, but Americans
were blazing, being rampant all day. London
professionals bought wildly in spite of heavy
profit-taking In Northern Pacifies, which was
counterbalanced by froe general buying from
Berlin. The best opinion here now deprecates
the boom, pointing out as evidence of pura
manipulation that ths Pacific roads have risen
K dally for some time, whereas Canadian Pa
cific, which benefits equally from trade condi
tions, is unmoved. Pails spurted Tintos one
point on the rise ln metal. Call money was
easy on the turn of the year. The market re
paid the bank virtually all Its borrowings. The
copper fortnightly statistics were stationary.
The year's figures f-how supplies of 2SO.OO0 tons,
of which 161,000 tons were American, against
22S.000 tons last year, of which 113.000 tons were
American.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Jan. 2. â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market the past week has been quiet. As this
period is one of stock taking, balancing of ac
counts, etc., very little business was expected.
While the demand has been -generally quiet
and the volume of sales small there is a con
fident feeling in the trade and the belief pre
vails that a better business is to develop after
the new year gets fairly under way. There
has been no disposition to' force wool on the
part of holders, who are content to wait until
the heavyweight eeasoii opens. Advices from
abroad Indicate continued firm markets an.l
holders in the West are unwilling to make any
concessions in prices. The demand during the
past week has run to both fine and medium
stock, mostly territories and scoured wools and
the purchasing has been largely by the me
dium-sized mills, the largest consumers not yet
being a factor In the market. The sales for
the week in Boston amounted to 1.324,000 pounds
domestic and 125,000 pounds foreign, making a
totnl of 1,449.000 pouuds. against a total of
2,503,700 pounds for thu previous week, and a
total of 2,t05,600 pounds for the corresponding
week last year.
New York Metal Market
NEW YORK. Jan. 2.â Speculatlvely the mar
ket for metals was a small one. Sales of small

at London for tin to Â£121 lCs. but was very
quiet. The local market for that metal was
also nominally lower under a lack of support,
ruling duir all day and closed dull at $26 75Â®
27 25. Copper was inactive and unchanged,
closing at $17 fcr lake nnd $16 62H for casting.
Exports of copper for December aggregated
10,771 tons, making a total -for the year of
131.988 tons. Lead was dull and unchanged at
$4 37^. Spelter wad unchanged at $4 12Â»/2@
4 17Â»J. Domestic iron markets show no im
portant features, ruling dull and nominally
unchanged.

FOUR-TEAR-OLD COLORED GIRL "WHO HAS BEEN TAUGHT BY DIS

OF VICES.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 2.â The persistency of
Mrs. Justin Rice, a street preacher, has
landed her In Jail three times within
twenty-four hours and she still threatens
to pursue her calling. Mrs- Rice and her
husband, a cowboy evangelist, have been
holding forth in this city for the past few
days. Yesterday afternoon she was ar
rested twice for blockading the streets
and released each lima on $10Â«bail.
Before Justice Cobb this morning sha
and her husband promised" to leave the
city If the cases were dismissed. This"
was done. Mrs. Rice then went out and
held another meeting. She was again ar
rested and friends put up $3) ball. A Jury
trial was demanded and the trial set for
January 7. She declares she will teat th9
ordinance prohibiting such meetings.

possession of whisky. S.he drinks the
fiery liquid with the satisfaction of a con
firmed toper. Mrs. Freeman states that
Irene one day drank a quart of the liquid
and showed no ill effects from it.
Mrs. Freeman saw that It was her duty
to have the child properly cared for, and
yesterday she brought her to the office
of the society. She stated the case to
Secretary White and Officer McMurray.
and used as they are to cases of deprav
ity they were greatly shocked. The child
bore out all the good colored woman said
of her. She shocked her questioners with.
a string of vile epithets. She said she
liked to "moke a pipe" and was able to
describe her sensations. :
The child is a degenerate, and her con
dition is due to the heanlessnesa of her
parents. They had forsaken the little
one and left her in surroundings unfit
even for a mature .person. 'While living
with the Jackson woman the child im
bibed all the corruption that only associa
tion with dissipated people could bring
about.
Mrs. Freeman waa loth to part with her
charge. She brought Irene to the Humane
Society's office for the purpose of leaving
her in care of the officers. After taking
an affectionate adieu of the baby she de
parted. Five minutes later she returned
and with tears in her eyes asked Secre
tary White whether ehe could take the
little one home with her. Permission waa
granted and the "mammy" departed In a
happy mood. She notified the officers,
however, that when they found a home
for Irene they could call for the child.
' Secretary white, and Officer McMurray
have set about investigating the sad case.
Arrests will probably follow, and tjie per
sons guilty of teaching tha child to use
drugs and whisky will bÂ© severely pun
ished. Â¦-?Â¦*;

LEGAL FIGHT FOR
PROPERTY LEFT BY
DON LUIS ARGUELLO
Children of the Old Spaniard will
Press Their Suit to Obtain a
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 2.â There will be a fight
over the estate left by Don Luis Antonio
Arguello, a prominent figure in the early
history of the State, who died at Santa
Clara several years ago. After he had
raised a large family of children the old
don took unto himself a second wife, one
much younger than himself. He evident
ly expected his children to mako trouble,
for before his death he gave away most
of his property, which was valued at sev
eral hundred thousand dollars. The
widow, Edelfrlda C. de Arguello, was
given a goodly share and all of his chil
dren were remembered except Carlos,, a
son. Carlos Arguello sued hla brother,
James, for a division of a valuable busi
ness block in this city, alleging that
James Arguello had been given the prop
erty only in trust to be divided betwen the
two at the father's death. Three different
suits were tiled by Carlos* but not prose
cuted, and James was finally given judg
ment.
About a year ago suit was commenced
by Albert R. Arguello, Mrs. Rita A.
Barron a/id Mamie Kinney, children of
Don Luis Argueljo. for the revocation
of the will of their father, which was ad
mitted to probate on December 30, 1S9S.
Since that time nothing has been done and
it was supposed that the suit might be
dropped. Now the contestants have ob
tained an order directed to the respond
ents to show cause on January 11 why the
probate of the will should not be re
voked. The citation was directed to
Edelfrida C. de Arguello, Clara Parks,
James S. Arguello, Carlos Arguello, Mar
garet Fischer and Louisa George.
An attempt will be made to prove that
undue Influence was exercised over Don
Luis Arguello and It Is said the deeds to
the widow and children may be attacked.

Other complaints were also received
concerning the bold operations' of the

companions at all hazards. Yesterday
Hammill caused an advertisement to be

The Stone woman lost no time fn going
to the house and as she started to enter
Hammill placed her under arrest. Hiding

IJuzzello of 416 Golden Gate avenue in the
same manner.
Shortly after Customs Collector Strat
ton assumed the duties of his office he
received an order from the Commissioner
of Immigration to exclude attorneys from
the Chinese Bureau during the hearings
of applications for the admission of Chi
nese to this country- Mr. Stratton's pre
decessor had allowed attorneys this privi
lege, and consequently the attorneys loud
ly protested against the recent order. At
their request Collector Stratum forwarded
to Washington a letter in which were
embodied the reasons advanced by the
lawyers, why they should not be excluded
from the examinations.
A reply to the letter was received yes
terday from Commissioner Powderly, in
which reply the Commissioner says:
"The right of an attorney to appear In
behalf of his client before any court in
order to protect said cllfint's right to
property or to liberty Is undeniable. It
does not appear to the bureau, however,
that the examination of an alien China
man who Pf-eks admission to this coun
try Is. In any sense, a trial, and for that
reason it does not appear necessary for
the defense of his right that counsel
should be admitted, who would undoubt
edly resort to all the obstructive meas
ures known to the profession in order to
secure for such client admission to this
country, whether the latter were entitled
to it or not.
"It seems to the bureau that the condi
tions under which 6uch examinations are
made do not admit of the presence and
interference of attorneys. There is al
ways the recourse of an appfeal by t'he
rejected Chinaman to the department in
this matter, and it would seem that the
intervention of counsel learned in the law
might be construed as essential to the
protection of the rights of such excluded
Chinese. Any irregularity or disregard of
the evidence adduced in favor of the Chi
nese applicant for admission whose ap
plication has been rejected by the Col
lector can by counsel be transmitted to
the department with such comments
thereon as he may Â»ee fit to make or such
arguments either as regards the evidence
or the law upon which tne Collector's de
cision was based as he may wish to pre

Physicians Declare Death
Was Not Due to
OAKLAND. Jan. 2.-There was a mur
der committpri off Point Richmond when
Captain A, Stendel of the sloop Lulu lost
hie life.
This was proved this evening at
Berkeley when an autopsy was held upon
the body that was found at Bath Beach
after Mrs. Stendel bad identified it aa the
body of her husband..
The autopsy physicians will not say as
to the form of death, but they do say that
he met his death before the body come
Into the water, and that drowning was
not the cause.
So the theory of Sheriff VealÂ© of Contra
Costa County that there had been a mur
der committed that dark night off Point
Ricnmond when tho cries for help were
heard by the watchman on the Point
Richmond wharf has been proved correct
by the doctors who used their science and
their skill upon the body that floated
ashore at Berkeley. The nnal and com
plete report of the autopsy physicians will
be given to the Coroner's jury, which will
Friday night hold an inquest and fix the
blamo for the death.
This conclusion reached by the physi
cians to-nleht only intensifies the mys
tery that surrounds the case, for in the
pockets of the corpse $s5 10 was found,
thus doing away witli the theory of mur
der for the sake of robbery.
Was it a quarrel, and if bo, with whom
and over what difference? This 1b the
question that faces the officers of Contra
(Joeta and Alameda counties now. and
they have but little to work upon in or
der to solve the mystery.
Mra. Stendel came to Berkeley this
morning with her brother and posltively
identined the body. She viewed the wave
bettered remains of her husband, and al
though the face was disfigured beyond
recognition she declared the general fea
tures to be those of Stendel. She gave a
minute description of the purse found on
thG man, a black leather affair, with
Email outside pockets, which she says sha
pave to her husband a few weeks ago.
The clothes he wore were Identified: but
the strongest proof that the body found
was that of the missing Stendel was the
plate of false teeth which he wore and
which his wife described minutely and
Identified completely.
The autopsy was performed by Dr. J. S.
Eastman, assisted by Dr. Thomas Mc-
Cleave, both of Berkeley, and Dr. John
Morrison of Martinez. The lungs showed
no trace of water, this fact eliminating?
all possibility of drowning.
"Stendel had ceased to breathe before
his body reached the water," said . Dr.
Eastman. "He was not drowned. We
feel that the case must be investigated
more thoroughly before we can give out
the exact cause of death. It presents
some points which need careful considera
tion." .
As soon as the result of the autopsy
physicians was given to the Coroner he
notified Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa
County, in whose jurisdiction the murder
occurred. Sheriff Veale announced that
he would come down early to-morrow and
would confer with the authorities of this
county as to the search for the murderer.
An effort will be made to trace Stendel
from the time he left San Francisco and
find out who he was with. Sheriff VealÂ©
Is still of the opinion that the man In the
green boat knows all about the crime. -
Coroner Mehrmann has set the inquest
for Friday night at Berkeley. Thi3 late
date is necessary because it will take
some time to gather the '-witnesses
from Point Richmond and. brinp them to
Berkeley, where the Inquest will be held.
Stendel s body will be burled in Moun
tain View Cemetery to-morrow. The
funeral services will be held at 2 o'clock
from the undertaking parlors of Brown &
Strelghtif in Berkeley..

TAHITI ENJOYING
LIVELY TIMES
Consul J. Lamb Doty Ar
rivts on Australia and
Is Enthusiastic.
J. Lamb Doty, Consul of the United
States In Tahiti, arrived yesterday on the
Australia and Is stopping at the Occi
dental Hotel. When seen last night he
was enthusiastic over the prospects of the
Island now there was regular connection
with San Francisco by a line of steamers.
Doty has been a resident of Tahiti
for the last twelve years. He has this
to say about the islands:
"Business will now boom in Tahiti for
several reasons. The merchants down
there will be able to order goods in San
Francisco and receive them in thirty days,
while in thft past all these goods had. to
be brought in sailing packets. We shall
be able to ship up fruit to San "Francisco
which will be a new industry for us. W e
made the attempt to send fruit about ten
years ago by the packets but it was a
failure It Is very evident .what a big
thing this fruit industry will be for us
when you know that when the Australia
arrived in port to-day she brought the
largest consignment of fruit ever brought
to this city. Most of It consisted of pine
apples. â¢Â¦ Â¦'Â¦"â¢
"The natives down In Tahiti are en
lightened. This Is due to the splendid
educational opportunities offered them by
the French Government, which owns the
Islands. They are all a happy, prosperous
people. I am sure that with this line of
steamships all tourists from the East
and the West will visit Tahiti.
"We hope to build a bicycle track
around the island from Papeete that will
be 120 miles long. When it is completed
It can be safely said that it will be a
100-mile ride In paradise. For anybody
who is fond of studying native life Tahiti
Is the place to visit. It Is the most beau
tiful epot on the globe."

and Mrs. McKlnley gave a dinner in honor
of the Cabinet members and their ladies.
The table was in the. shape of a double

CRITICIZES HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW
Tacoma Man Files a Unique
Divorcd Suit.
Cross Complaint in
&DÂ«cial DiiDatch to The Call
TACOMA, Jan. 2.â Judge Carroll to-day
denied the motion of Mrs. W. H. Bran
scheid to have stricken from her hus
band's cross complaint for divorce some
incisive and uncomplimentary remarks
regarding her mother, Mrs. Eliza F. King,
a wealthy San Francisco woman.
The defendant's cross complaint, to
which objection was made by Mrs. Bran
scheid, is one of the most novel docu
ments on record In the court. It abounds
in keen and sarcastic paragraphs and the
conventional legal verbiage is discarded
to make the allusion to his wite's mother,
Mrs. Eliza King, the more cutting. . Mrs.
Branscheid, he says, is under the com
plete domination of her mother.
"Herself a widow and divorcee, having
very wrongful, peculiar, improper and
extraordinary notions of and concerning
marital relations, husbands, wives, do
mestic economy, the bearing of children,
the use of intoxicants, narcotics and other
drugs; morals, religion, pecuniary obliga
tions and the male sex In general."
That is how he describes the mother-in
law. She is, he says, possessed of $50,
000 or $60,000 In her own right and besides
has expectancies of large wealth by rea
son of being the daughter of Robert - R.
Thompson of San Francisco, who Is said
to be worth several million dollars.
It Is through fear that she will be dis
inherited by her mother, he alleges, that
hisÂ« wife has been Induced to bring her
suit for divorce. Branscheid complains
further that several weeks ago. his
mother-in-law called with an' express
wagon at the . place where he Is rooming,
during his absence at the store, and' de
manded his furniture, but his landlady re
fused to give It up and notified him. He
immediately, went home, taking a police
man along, and ordered her to leave the
premises under threat of arrest. : Bran
echeid Is a hardware dealer here.
A BOLD daylight burglar came to
grief yesterday afternoon while
plying his vocation on Montgom
ery 'avenue, through the pluck
and persistence of Mrs. L. Bo
daire, who fought him until her strength
was exhausted, supplemented by the
sprinting abilities of Special Officer Wll
iiam Thompson and Patrolmen John
Duane and Robert Silver.
Shortly before 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon Mrs. Bodaire, whose husband con
ducts a dyeing establishment at 321 Mont
gomery avenue, went upstairs to her
room. When she opened the door she was
surprised to see a man searching a trunk,
his pockets loaded with stolen property.
Mrs. Bodaire rushed at the intruder and
seized him. The man fought with her
for some time and finally wrenched him
self free and escaped from the room.
Rushing down the stairs, the burglar tried
a door leading to the sidewalk and rind
ing It locked smashed a glass light and
made his exit.
As the burglar climbed into the street
he explained to pedestrians that a mad
dog was in the house and he walked leis
urely away, but Mrs. Bodaire arrived on
the scene and shouted to several people
to stop the man, as he was a thler
When the crook saw the woman he
flashed down the street and ran into a
saloon on Broadway and out through a
rear entrance. On â¢ Dupont street he
mounted a milk wagon and gathering up
the reins drove hastily away. The three
offlcers succeeded in overhauling him and
platelng him under arrest.
At the City Prison the man gave the
name of Joseph Brooks, which. the police
telleve to be an alias. lie had two re
volvers fully loaded in his pockets anil
a quantity of stolen property of small
value. . t

UNITY LODGE'S SURPRISE
TO A PYTHIAN COLONEL
Novel Method of Making Presenta
tion of Token of Appreciation
for Services Rendered.
At the last held meeting of the Knights
of Pythias in Pythian Castle twelve
pa&es were given the rank of esquire
after having passed a good examination
in the page rank. Immediately after that
rank had been conferred, to the surprise
of the many present who were not in the
secret, the newly created esquires, at the
request of the master at arms, took seats
in chairs that had previously been ar
ranged in the form of a semi-circle or
crescent, after which Past Chancelor
Frank 8. Kelley introduced something not
in the ritual, and that was an explanation
of the Oriental significance of the cres-
At the close of his remarks Mr. KelUy
stated that the symbol he had explained
was not complete without a star, and
requested that the new esquires name
some one to personate the star. With one
accord they exclaimed "Richmond," and
Colcnel Albert Richmond was invited to
a seat facing the crescent. Then the past
chancelor in an eloquent address told of
the work that Colonel Richmond had done
for the Knights of Pythias generally and
Unity Lodge in particular, after which
he requested the colonel to rise in his
seat and "about face" and remove the
cover from a table that had been placed
at his back while he was being spoken
to. Thinking himself the victim of a
practical joke he hesitated, but finally
did as he was bid, and there was present
ed to his view a cut-glass salad bowl with
gold spoon and fork, which he was in-
Formed was a token of appreciation from
the lodge to him, and that the holiday
season had been selected as the proper
time to make the presentation.
The colonel in a modest speech returned
thanks and pledged himself to use all
honorable means in the future as in the
past to spread the light of Pythianlsm.
The meeting closed with good wishes for
the new year and the extending of the
glad hand.

Ideas on Advertising.
In an attractively prepared booklet en
titled "Morse's Agate Rule" the Lyman
D Morse Advertising Agency .of New-
York is circulating clever ideas on adver
tising for the benefit of advertisers gen
erally and Incidentally for the good of
the publishers. In what is considered so
prosy a field one would naturally expect
a drv-as-dust volume, but the compilers
have made instead a very interesting col
lection of good things and even ventured
into 'verse, of which the following Is a
sample, and apropos:

when the Tax Collector demands bonds
from the deputies the reasonableness of
the bond exacted will, be considered.
While the charter provides that he may
require a bond to lndeixmify him against

POLICE RAIDING
LOTTERY GAMES
Fan-tan, pie gow, lottery and other
games which are barred by the statutes
were In full blast In Chinatown last
night.
The faces of the fat and sleek pro
prietors of the many gambling cluba
were wreathed In smiles as they watched
the stream of patrons flowing. In and
out while uniformed , police officers
patrolled the streets of the Chinese'quar
ter and made no attempt to Interfere.
Yesterday afternoon Captain Wlttman
learned that the proprietors of several
lottery games had broken their contract
not to allow whites to visit their places,
and after a consultation with Chief Sul
livan it was decided to raid the games.
Accompanied by a formidable squad and
loaded down with heavy sledges. "Wlttman
marched into Chinatown. The first game
raided was a lottery joint at 711 Com
mercial street. The huge iron door was
battered down, but only the keeper waa
found in the place. He was at oncÂ«
taken to police headquarters, together
with a number of marked lottery tickets,
which were found in an apparently un
used trunk. Other games at 727 Sacra
mento street, 815 Dupont, 1100 Stockton
and 39 Washington alley, were also raid
ed and the keepers placed under arrest.
At the City Prison they were charged
with conducting lottery games.
Chief Sullivan is determined to stop
the practice of white men being allowed
to visit the lottery and other games In
Chinatown.
"Under no consideration shall white
people be admitted to the Chinese
games," he said yesterday. "Heretofore
they have played at the same table with
the Chinese gamblers, but I intend to put
a stop to It. As soon as I learn that
whites are allowed in any of these places
I will immediately send a squad of my
men to the offending proprietor of the
game. The Chinese may gamble amqng
themselves, but under no consideration
will I allow the white tempters of Dame
Fortune to participate In the game."
From another source it Â¦was learned
that the agreement between the Chinese
gamblers and the police Is that the whites
are to be barred from the games, and any
violation means that the Chinaman
breaking this part of the compact is to
be summarily punished.
In accordance with the scheme to li
cense gambling among the Chinese Cap
tain "Wittman yesterday swore out a
batch of warrants for the arrest of the
proprietors of the games. They will be
served to-day. The defendants will at
once be taken Into the Police Court,
where they will enter a plea of guilty.
Just what fine will be imposed the heads
of the department refused to say. but It
is understood that it will be fixed at ?I00
for each game. This will be done at the
beginning of every month and the money
turned into the city treasury.
They Allowed Whites to Visit Their
Games in Violation of Their
Agreement With Chief
Sullivan.

Failing to Live Up to
