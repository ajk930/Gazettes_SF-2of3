CHILE'S PROPOSITION TO PARTITION
BOLIVIA AMONG FIVE GOVERNMENTS
LONDON, Jan. 19.â Alarming ru
mors were circulated yesterday to
the effect that Queen Victoria is
Berloufly ill and that her family
has been summoned to Oaborne.
The Prince of Wales is now at Marlbor
cugh HouFe, where no news has been
received indicating that her Majesty is
furiously ill. The Duke of York went to
Sandringham this afternoon. His visit to
Australia has been postponed.
Sir Franci? I.akir.g, surgeon to her
Majesty, has been called in to consult
with Sir Francis Reid, her Majesty's resi
dent physician.
The following official announcement re
garding the Queen's health was made
last night:
"The Queen, during the paÂ«t year, has
had a great strain upon her powers,
which has rather told upon her nervous
system. It has therefore been thought
advisable by her Majesty's physicians
that her Majesty should be kept per
fectly quiet In the house and should ab-
Ftain from transacting business."
Although it is fully understood that
ihere is no cause for alarm beyond what
would naturally be felt at the indisposi
tion of any one of the ape of the Queen,
the official announcement issued^ last
<>venir.p has caused a shock to the coun
try, the effect of which it would be dif
ficult to exaggerate. Her Majesty's ab
f^olut* 1 freedom from illness during the
1c ripest reign in English history has led
her people to regard her almost as more
than mortal, and the mere novelty of
having to face the possibility of a regency
f-.ione suffices to creat unnecessary appre
hension.
It is necessary to go back to a date prior
to ISM for a similar situation. Since that
tim" there has never been an interruption
of the smooth working of the constitu
tional machine. No one. not even the
Prince of Wales, can act for the Queen
vi.hout the authority of Parliament, and,
as no stops have been taken to summon
Parliament, it may be taken for granted
that her Majesty's physicians have only
ndopted measures of precaution and that
? h? is still able to *isn any absolutely im
perative documents, though relieved of the

Corletfs bill provides that, on the death
of, a husband, the community property
shall go to the wife without administra
tion, as it now eoes to the husband on the
death of a wife. Senator Sims started tha
debate by suggesting, ihat, as the bill had
been Introduced by request and was an old
bill weir known to the other, legislators,
he believed the proper course would be to
deny: it third reading Â«nd kill it at once.
Smith ' of ; Kern ; spoke in favor of the
measure as one giving the wife legal
rights with ' the husband regarding com
munity property;, as the theory of the lav/
contemplated. He said the bill would be
defeated, as the lawvers of the Senate
were against it, but he believed it' was a
good measure and he vrould vote for it \
This brought Davis; to: his feet with an
explanation of what the Judiciary Com
mittee bad about the bill and
a word or two in favor of lawyers, who
he said, would always be found fightlncr
for the purity, and justice of the law.
â¢Smith answered with the statement that
lawyers did - less for â¢ society than any
other class and he believed that others not
lawyers were quite as competent to judsra
of the- value, of Jaws. Devlin also spoke
against the- measure. Â¦--..-.-. -

from the First and put Into the Second,
the apportionment has made but little
progress.
Senator Davis objects to having his dis

MEN'TO. Jan. 18.â Speaker Pendleton
found himself in the minority to-day, al
though he had the support of Grove L.
Johnson. Alden Anderson. Dunlap and
even the leadens of the Democratic minor
ity. Against his expressed wish the As
sembly adjourned at 11:80 o'clock until
11 o'clock Monday, and it would have
made It longer If it could have done so
without losing- pay.
The question came up on a motion of
Schlesingpr of San Francisco to adjourn
till 11 o'clock Monday. Johnson at once
arose to oppose the motion. He said:
â¢â¢We are now at the end of the second
week of the Bersion, and the chief work
accomplished has been that of placing a
long list of attaches In positions where
they can render valuable services to the
State. I hope this motion will be voted
dflwn and that we will stay here and get
down to work en the bills which are now
back from the printer."
Schlesinger said that It was all very
well for Johnson, who lived here, to talk
in that strain, but members from San
Francisco and Â«lsewhere desired to ad
journ and get home to their families.
Guilfoyle said they did not want leaves
of absence â troy did not want the Assem
bly to be In session during their absence.
Melick offered an amendment providing
for a simple adjournment, which -would
have meant a session to-morrow mornirvr
at 9:30 but It was voted down. The result
was received with noisy hand-clapping
over In the San Francisco section, where
Houripan, Evatt. Bro^ra. Henry, Brady.
Franklin. McLaughlln. Collins. Butler.
Guilfojie and Brown form a galaxy that

Webber offered an amendment making
the hour for convening on Monday 12:30

Dunlap suavely said that he favored the
amendment, as it would save the State
the salaries of- the entire Assembly for
thr<*Â« days, flnce If the adjournment were
to be uniil later than noon Mondayâ a
three davs' adjournmentâ pay would not

Cutter made a spirited explanation. In

electrician for the Senate was needed and
would involve no Increase of the payrool,
because "Wicks would simply receive the
pay that had been drawn by a page wha
was to take the place now held by -Wicks

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 13.â Senator Ashe Intro
duced a bill to-day adding Incurable In
sanity to the grounds for divorce already
mentioned In the statutes. In a separata
bill he provides that to constitute a causa
for divorce the insanity must have con
tinued for at least two years aftsr tha
party has been adjudged Insane and tha
plaintiff seeking divorce upon that
ground must prove to tho satisfaction off
the court that the insanity is incurable.
Section 1. \Every franchise or privilege to
erect or lay telegraph or telephone wires, to
construct or operate street railroads upon any
public street or highway, to lay gas pipes
for the purpose of carrying gas for power,
to erect poles or wires for transmitting elec
tric power along; or upon any public street or
highway, or to exercise any other privilege
whatever hereafter proposed to be granted by
boards of supervisors, boards of trustees, or
common councils, or other governing or legis
lative bodies of any city and county, city or
town within this Btate, except steam rail
roads, telegraph or telephone lines doing an
'ntersUte business, and renewals of franchises
for plera, chutes or wharves, shall be granted
upon the conditions In this act provided, and
not otherwise.
The sentiment of Los Angeles is strong
ly against the bill, because it Is believed
that in Los Angeles Its effects will be felt.
That, under conditions as they exist down
there, the bill favors the Southern Pacific
and the Santa Fe as against any line that
may wish to start within the county, or
as against such a system as the Salt Lake
system, there can be no doubt. It is the
hope of the delegation to arrive from the
south that It may so amend the bill as
to make its provisions equitable for all
companies, new and old, large and small.
In its present shape It is the general opin
ion it favors interstate companies as
against local companies so largely that
the local companies would have practi
cally no chance under its provisions.
The railroad franchise Is the one most
discussed in relation to the bill, but the
railroad franchise is only, one of those
which come under Its provisions. It places
no restriction upon what an extension
shall be, and whether or not it must be of
the- same character as the main system,
and there is nothing in the bill to prevent
the Southern Pacific, with thousands of
miles of track, runing an electric "exten
sion" through a few valuable blocks In
San Francisco and paying a percentage
on gross receipts proportionate to the to
tal earnings In the same relation as the
few blocks to the thousands of miles of
track. Under that provision the payment
upon such a franchise as the Third-street
line in San Francisco would be but a drop
In a reservoir.
The first section of the bill, describing
what it Intends to effect, is as follows:
It Is claimed, further, that under the
act a franchise may be held by the con
struction of but a part of the Â¦ road for
which the franchise was granted and it Is
claimed still further that section 8, which
provides that nothing shall be inserted in
the franchise which will restrict free and
open competition, will have an effect op
posite to that Intended. It is said that
to establish transfer systems Is often the
principal reason for an application for a
franchise, and under this provision It
would be impossible to make a transfer
privilege contingent upon the granting of
the franchise.
Another feature of the bill which is
considered a bad one is that which allows
any one to bid against the highest bidder
after the sealed bids have been opened.
Under this provision' a bid can be raised
without limit. Low bids can be tent in
to catch the franchise should none be
high, and these low bids would not pre
vent the low bidders from coming in again
and bidding against the high one. -
It further requires that within twenty
four hours the full amount of his bid
must be deposited by the successful bid
der, and If he does not put up the amount
the franchise shall be granted to the
next highest bid. Under this clause it is
possible for the man who ran the bids up
to escape from his high bid and let the
amount down through the bids of his
friends until Just before It comes to- the
opposing bidders and then take the fran
chise.

LARDNER'S DEMURRER
The bill. In section 2. provides that any
applicant for a franchise shall file with
the governing body of the municipality
en application, and then the governing
body may or may not advertise the same
for pale. It Is claimed that this provision
should be changed to compel the govern
ing body of a municipality to advertise
sn application for a franchise when a |
reasonable proportion of the people it is
Intended to affect shall petition the gov
ernipg body to make such advertisement, j
In section 3 the bill provides that the |
successful bidder must pay to the municl- |
pality "at least 2 per cent of the gross
annual receipts," leaving the definite per
centage to be paid a matter for the gov
erning 1kx5>- of the municipality to deter
mine. Under this general provision, it is
claimed, a road may be forced to pay a
percentage far above what it should cr
could, in order that it might bo forced
from the fifld to make way for some more
favored company.
In s-ectlon 4 the term "gross receipts,"
ai applied to a branch or extension. Is
0<=fir.ed as "one-half of the proportion of
total gross receipts of said system
which the mileage of such extension bears
to the total mileage of the whole system."
"To show how such a provision will
â¢work," eaid Mr. Rule this evening. "I
nted only refer to the street railway sit
uation In Los Angeles. The Los Angeles
Street Railway Company has forty miles
or more of track; the Traction Company
has ten or more. Under this provision
if each company applied for a franchise
to build a mile of track the Los Angeles
road would have to pay on but one-half
of one-fortieth, or one-eightieth, and the
Tractlcn Company would have to pay on
onee-half of one-tenth, or one-twentieth.
Or. if each built ten miles of road, the
Traction Company would have to pay on
one-half of its gross earnings and the
Los Angeles Company would have to pay
on only one-eighth. This Is a provision
that clearly favors an old and established
company and works against the extension 1
of a new and small one."
The objections Mr. Rule urges against
the measure are from the standpoint of
the Bait Lake road, which has already
tbrcrbed the Terminal Railway and is
making- ready to run a line from Los An
peles to Salt Lake. His first objection Is
that the bill leaves free access to any
rocd doing an Interstate business, leaving
out any provision for a road which has
a bona fide Intention to do an interstate

tion was not fipon its passage, but upon

were agreed to by a vote of 43 to 23. While

but In general ihe commit lee was sus
tained and the measure, with the excep
tion of the elimination ot the canteen
clause, is not widely different from ttiat
reported to the fcenate.
determined effort was made to-day to
amend the bill so as to provide against
the sale ot llQuor in tlie Philippines aiul
to prohibit the importation ot any xlni
of intoxicants into the Islands, but it was
defeated. ,
A notable speech was delivered durins
the day by Hale of Maine, who. while op
posing the Increase in the strength of the
array, stated cogently his reasons for sup
porting the bill. Every effort to prevent
the increase in the strength of the army
was defeated by a decisive majority.
As the bill originated in. the Senate it
will go directly to the conference com
mittee appointed by the two branches of
Congress.
Hale of Maine, in a brief but forceful
and earnest speed), enumerated some of
the reasons why he should vote for the
pending bill, lie thought the only ques
tion involved in the discussion was wheth
er the proposed army was needed- He
wished all the advocates of the bill had
been as frank in their utterances as Sew
ell of New Jersey, who had admitted that
probably TO.OpO men would be needed in
the Philippines for several years. Hale
ra!d he would be glad if the form of ne
gotiation with the Filipinos could have
been adopted as a means of settling: the
pending conflict, but Senators did not ap
prove of it. Ho believed, too, it would
; be better to attach a temporary force to
the present standing army, but the Senate
would not hear to that. He pointed out
that unless this bill Â¦was passed theie
would be in the Philippines after July 1
next, only about 20.000 American soldiers.
Pressed by the Filipino forces they would
be 'â¢hemmed in Manila" and would be
'â¢luckj- if they were not driven Into the
sea." He added:
"No man, no party, could stand upon
such a condition. Therefore I am con
strained, a? much as I am opposed to it,
to support this measure."
Hale declared that a standing army of
SQ.000 provided every soldier needed by
this country in time of neace. but he
â¢would vote for the pending bill because
"without it an almost immeasurable
disaster and tragedy might befall tho
army in the Philippines."
Spooler declared the prohibition amend
ment offered by Gallinger was essentially
mischievous. Stewart and Foraker op
posed the prohibition amendment
Perkins of California offered an amend
ment, which was agreed to, providing for
the payment of J2O0 to each soldier now
in the Philippines whose term will ex
pire before July 1 next and who will re
enlist for three years.
Spooner suggested an amendment leav
ing the fixing of the oa.y of native troops
to the discretion of the Secretary of War.
It was agreed to. â¢
McComas suggested several amend
ments, which -were agreed to. They strike
out the age limit for volunteer officers to
be examined for the grades of captains
and first or second lieutenants and to in
clude in those eligible for such examina
tion volunteer officers 'who served prior to
1S3S..
Gallinger then offered a new section to
the bill providing tha*. all licenses for the
sale of liauor in the Philippines hereto
fore granted be revoked and that none
hereafter be granted and that the impor
tation of beer, wine and distilled spirits
into the islands be prohibited. The amend
ment was rejected â 23 to 43.
An amendment offered by Lodge fixing
the allowances for c'f thing and rations
of the native Porto Rican soldier was
adopted.
Bacon proposed an amendment striking
out of the bill the oaragraphs authoriz
ing the President to increase the number
of men in any company of infantry, any
troop of cavalry, any battery of artillery
to the maximum. Rejectedâ 22 to 43.
Many amendments changing the bill in
minor particulars were offered, but as a
rule they were rejected without division.
The measure havine orginated in the
Senate, the question .hen was upon agree
ing to the bill as amended. The motion
to agree was adoptedâ 43 to 23â the de
tailed vote being as follows:

DECORATIONS
FOR AMERICANS
WASHINGTON, Jan. IS.â The Republi
can Senators decided to-day not to set a
day, at least for the present, for taking
up the Nicaragua canal bill. The decision
was reached after an hour and a half
spent in caucus and was unanimous. The
caucus was called largely because of Sen
ator Morgan's importunities in behalf of
the bill and an effort was made to effect
a satisfactory solution of the problem.
There was a general exchange of views
and many speeches weie made, but after
ajl had been said the Senators concluded
that so long as Great Britain's attitu;le
toward the amendments to the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty is undefined it would
not be wise or expedient to agitate the
question of the construction of the pro
posed canal.
Senator Allison, chaJiman of the cau
cus, was authorized to make this state
ment to Senator Morgan and other friend i
of the canal bill and -to the public in gen
eral. In giving it out he laid stress upon
the fact- that this conclusion was .'"for
the present." He also stated that the
question of what attention should be
given to the ship subsidy bill and to the
appropriation bills waa not discussed and
that "the matter Is in the hands of the
Senate."
The decision of the caucus was em
bodied in a resolution pi evented by Sena
tor Lodge. wTio stated that the conclu
sion 'as thus set forth was the result of
the best deliberations cf the Committee
on Order of Business. He expressed hi*
own firm conviction that at least for tha
present it would be out of place to press
the canal question while the treaty is
still a subject of negotiations and Eng
land's attitude is not completely defined.
Notwithstanding the fcrmal decision to
leave the canal question in abeyance for
the time being several Senators gave no
tice that in case there should be a mo
tion to take up the canal bill they would
not be bound by the resolution adopted
but would vote for a motion to consider.
In this expression of independence Sena
tor Piatt of New York was the leader.
He said he considered the proposed canal
of prime importance and would not re
frain from voting to take it up whenever
a motion to that effect was made. Sena
tors Simon, Foster and Bard followed
with similar declarations.
No decision was reached upon other
questions because no formal action was
considered necessary. There was, how
ever, considerable discussion of other
questions. Among these were the ship
subsidy bill, the war revenue reduction
bill, the confirmation of Mr. Harlan as
Attorney General of Porto Rico, the rati
fication of the treatv with Spain for the
acquisition of some of the Philippine
Islands, not included in the original Paris
treaty and the appropriation bills.
â¢ Senator Hanna expressed' his desire to
have the ship subsidy bill passed upon
during the present session and said that
with the army bill out of the way he
should ask that the decision arrived at
early in the session to press the ship
subsidy would be adht-red to. \
Hanna was reminded of the necessity oT
giving first attention to the appropriation
bills and he said that he fully understood
that and he only meant to ask that the
subsidy bill should receive attention when
the appropriation bills were not up for
consideration.
There was general assent to this propo
sition, but it was suggested that there
were other subjects which should be
passed upon before- adjournment, but
which it was believed would require a
great deal of time. Senator Aldrlch ex
plained in this connection the necessity
of getting the war revenue reduction bill
through during the session, and he stated
that he hoped to be able to report it from
the Committee ,on Finance during the
early part of next week. Aldrich also
said that he hoped to secure a unanimous
agreement from the committee, and that
if successful he hoped the Senate would
not require a great deal of time. To get
the bill through promptly it was neces
sary there should be no effort to amend
it by putting on tariff amendments. To
attempt anything in that line would, he
said, opeivup the entire tariff question,
and the only safe course was to leave
the b.Â»l as It now was, an internal reve
nue measure only.. There was general as
sent to this proposition, and assurances
were given that the caucus would sustain
him in that position.
Senator Foraker stated that he would
again seek to get up the Harlan nomina
tion at the first opportunity, and he asked
that Republican Senators remain in suf
ficient numbers to guarantee a quorum
because of Senator Pettigrew's notice
that he should require a- roll call on the
vote to confirm. The importance of get
ting the Spanish treaty through was pre
sented by Senator Lodge, who said that
the ratification of the treaty was neces
sary to clean up our dealings with Spain.
Senator Proctor also asked time for con
sideration of the oleomargarine bill. Sen
ator Hale replied to this request that the
bill had not yet been reported from Sen
ator Proctor's committee. To this the
Vermont Senator replied the committee
would be prepared to report next week.
Hanna Urges- That the Ship Sub
sidy Bill Be Finally Passed

Session.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
CHANGE OF CLIMATE
Not Necessary in Order to Cure
Catarrh.
The popular Idea that the only cure for
chronic catarrh is a change of climate is a
mistake, because catarrh is found in all
cl'.rr.ates in all ructions of the country,
and even if a change of climate should
benefit for a time, the catarrh will cer-
tainly return.
Catsrrh may be readily cured In any cli-
rnatp, but the only way to do It is to de-
stroy or remove from the system the ca-
tarrhal germs which cause all the mis-
chief.
The treatment by inhalers, sprays, pow-.
<*.r-rs and washes has been proven almost
i.'i-'-Iefs in making a permanent cure, as
they do not reach the seat of disease,
â¢which is In the blood and can be reached
only by an internal remedy, which acts
throusrh the stomach upon the blood and
eymLexa pcntrally.
A new discovery which is meeting with !
remarkable success in curing catarrh ot
th" hf-ad. throat and bronchial tubes, and
e!?o oetarrh of the stomach, is sold by
drugpij=ts under name of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets. /
These tablets, which are pleasant and
harrnlp<=.Â« to take, owe thoir efficiency to
the active medicinal principles of Blood
Root. Red Gum and a new specific called
tiuaiacol. which, topothor with valuable
ar.tiFf-plics, are corabinrd In convenient
palatable tablet form and as valuable for
children as for adults.
Mr. A. B. Fernbank of Columbus. Ohio
pay?: I Fuffered eo many winters from
Catarrh that I took it as a matter of
course, and that, nothing would cure it
except a change of climate, which my
business affairs would not permit me to
take.
My noetrils were almost always clogged 1
Â¦up. I had to breathe through the mouth
causing an Inflamed, irritated throat. The
thought of eating breakfast often nause-
eted me, and the catarrh gradually get-
tin*r Into my stomach took away my ap-
petite and digestion.
My druggist advised me to try a 50-cent
box of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because
he Brtii he had 6O many customers who
had beer* cured of Catarrh by the use of
these tablets that he felt he could honest-
ly recommend them. I took his advice
and ub*<5 several boxes, with results that
surprised and delighted me.
I always keep a box of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets in the house, and the whole fam-
.ily use them freely on the first appearance
of a cough or cold in the head.
With our children we think there Is
nothing no safe and reliable as Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets to ward off croup and
colds, and with older people I have known
of cases where the hearing had been se-
riously impaired by chronic catarrh cured
entirely by this new remedy.

HAD, EA.DLEB ft CO., Distributers. Bin fnseUet.AT the enfl of this month the Pa
cific Athletic Association will hold
one of its old-time championship
boxing tournaments for all
classes. In former days these
glove contests drew out bunches of young
aspirants and the sport furnished was
surprisingly gocd. For several years'am
ateur boxing has. retrograded, but It
seems now to be in a fair way to return
to its former nourishing state.
The great feeding ground of boxers, the
Olympic Club, is alive with the men of
mits. Day and night De Witt Van Coun.
who Is handling the Olympians, and Al
Lean, who is training them, are kept busy
with a score of these young ring perfcS'rni
ers, who work not for a monetary con
sideration, but for fistic glory and a
medal. The Olympic Club will be repre
sented In the tournament by the greater
number of boxers, although the Reliance.
Alameda and outride clubs will have quite
a few of their own men in the llststo con-
test against the local clubmen. The entry
list of boxers will be so long this year that
three days will be consumed in the work-
Ing of the tournament. .
'Of all the Olympic entries W. J. Leon
ard Is rated as the. cleverest and fastest.
He is essentially a boxer, as his perform
ances in the tournament of 1S99. when he
won the Oelrichs belt, demonstrated.,
Weighing 125 pounds, he was in the same
class as J. L. Scholes. the-. American
champion, and they, met last year in the
Olympic tournament. Scholes took first
and Leonard second prize in this class.
H. W. Finke. 145 pounds, came out of
the tournament of 1900. with more than
glowing honors. He defeated Dukelow,
the American champion, and by doing so
won the distinction of being the only Call
fornian who outdistanced any of the visit
ors.
Then there will be Jimmie Britt. more of
a fighter than a boxer, but a clever man
at that. He will be In the 133-pound class.
Frank McConnell, the 115-pound cham
pion, will be there with his fists, and Dan
Danzlger. a bantam a year ago, will be
in the 125-pound class for this tourna
ment. Denny Carroll has lost no time in
training, and every ounce of his 135 pounds
will be felt. Joe Doyle is the representa
tive in the 145-pound class.
Seventy-three applications have been re
ceived for' entering privileges, two of
which have been 'rejected on account of
professionalism and one on account of
weak physical condition. All contestants
must report at the club the night before
the tournament begfns.- January 30, and
submit to an examination by Dr. Dean,
the club physician. Leader John Ham
mersmith announces that the contests will
commence at 8 p. m. sharp, and that from
fourteen to sixteen fights will be run off
each nipht of the tournament.
After this tournament the Olympic Club
will arrange for another, with the East
ern champions as the feature.

HUNT CLUB AT
TANFORAN PARK
This afternoon the first match of the
third annual series of home-and-hofne
tournaments between teams of the San
Francisco and the Oakland golf clubs will
be played on the Point Adams links. After
the dry weather of the last few days the
course, except In a few low lying spots,
should be in good condition. The teams
this year consist of only six men each, in
stead of eight, as heretofore. Captain L.
O. Kellogg of the San Francisco Golf Club
and acting Captain P. -E. Bowles of the
Oakland Golf Club exchanged lists of
teams yesterday. Up to the last moment
no fewer than three of the San Francisco
representatives were doubtful, but the
team will be mafie up from the following:
John Lawson, S. L. Abbot Jr.. J. W
Byrne, L. O. Kellogg, II. B. Goodwin R
H. Gaylord B. D. Adamson, H. D. Pills
bury and H. C. Golcher. The Oakland
representatives will be Ernest R. Folger.
W. P. Johnson, C. P. Hubbard, R. M
Fitzgerald. F. S. Stratton and T. >R
Hutchlnson. The smaller number of the
team is somewhat in favor of the Oak
landers, who have not so many strong
players as the San Francisco Club, if
Lawson and Goodwin are not able to play
the Oakland team, playing on its own
course, should be able to give the city
representatives a close rub. The. game
will be over eighteen holes, match play.
The second half of the match will 'be
played on the Presidio links next Satur
day, the scores made on both days being
reckoned together. The club whose team
wins the match will be entitled to the
possession of the sliver trophy till' the
second tournament, which will be played
on April 6 and 13.

FOR FIGHT
The Artel and Pioneer Rowing Club
houses both suffered injuries during the
recent southeasterly storm, a wooden
house being blown off Long wharf Into the
bay and driven by, the wind and waves
against the piles supporting the boat
houses. The underpinning of the Pioneer
boathouse has long been defective, and
small sums are frequently^ needed for re
pairs. The South End Rowing Club lost
the apron from. which boats are launched.
The tenure of . their boathouse by the
Squth Ends is insecure, and all three club3
are desirous to secure a location where
they may be certain of freedom from dis
turbance. The rowing men will use their
influence with the Legislature to get a
Bite' suitable for the erection of boat
houses and hope that they may be success
ful. As It is, the' Pioneer and Ariel boat
houses are old and inadequate to the re
quirements of the clubs, and the South
Ends are in constant danger of : having
their house and handball court cut in two
by the extension of Third street, for which
many of the property holders in that quar
ter are clamoring.
The Ariel Rowing Club recently appoint
ed William T. Howe and F. J. M. Kelly a
committee to confer with committees of
the South End and Pioneer Rowing clubs
with regard to the possibility of securing
new and suitable locations.

The final match for the Council's cup
for women of the San Francisco Golf Club
was won easily by Mrs. R. G. Brown,
whose opponent, Miss Hager, did not
make so good a contest as was. expected.
It was thought that Miss Hager. who
drives a long Dall and plays quite strongly
at times, would press Mrs. Brown pretty
closely, but the match was practically
won on the first round, and ended at the
thirteenth hole with seven up for the win
ner. Mrs. Brown was In great form, Miss
Hager taking only two holes out of the
thirteen. The competition was less inter
esting than it would have been had not
some of the strongest players been ab
sent, notably Miss Maud Mulllns, Miss M.

second, third and fourth in the ladles'

accommodate the crowd. Some changes
will be made in the arrangements for
spectators before the season opens. The
last heavy windstorm lifted a portion of
the roof and took it to parts unknown.
This at least insures a new roof, one
which will not sing with every gust of
wind that strikes the grounds. The
shingles of the grand stand roof last sea
son rattled in terrifying fashion whenever
fretted by the western zephyrs.

the departure of Stockton was the reason
for a four days' schedule. The trips to

much time that the visiting team wlll.be

The California Baseball League held
several meetings during the past two
weeks, organizing for the coming season,
which will begin a few days before the
April showers and end when the winter
rains set in.
The most radical of all the changes over
last season is in the number of games
scheduled.- Instead of baseball twice a
week we will have four daya of itâThurs
day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Never
before has this been tried by t^a base
ball magnates of California, Three days
were tried at Halght street In the ecstatic
times of the national game, and the crowd
of shouters did not slight the grand stand
or bleachers at the midweek match. But
four days is an experiment the success
or non-success of which is to be seen after
the new plan Is put in operation.

THIS YEAR
It was one of the stormy kind
and resulted In the transaction of a great
deal of business.
The trainers came in for a big portion
of the committee's time and some sweep
ing changes will be forced upon this class.
The committee has been making a most
thorough investigation, and what it dis
covered was no less than appalling. They
found that by the use of certain rub
downs and stimulants dogs have been
practically doped. This accounts for the
many upsets and surprising defeats of fa
vorites. To prevent all this a new law
has been passed.
Hereafter the use of all stimulants will
be barred, except beef tea. As a rub
witchhazel will be the only medicinal ar
ticle allowed. If any other rub or stimu
lant other than beef tea and witchhazel
is found In the kennel or on the person
of any licensed trainer he will be Immedi
ately ruled off for life. This Is a drastic
measure, but It was deemed necessary by
the California coursing committee to keep
the sport clean.
The case of Stevens against Edmonds
came up before the committee, and the
evidence was of a conflicting nature, Ed
monds making several contradictory state
ments. Resolutions were passed that the

The contestants will start in five groups,

FOUR-MILE
RACE FOR
ATHLETES
THE Supervisors have had their say
and they have lixed the laws for
the holding of boxing contests.
One professional fight a month
will be the fistic course for San
Francisco. Accredited athletic clubs may
hold contests once every month, and there
the tUht promoters and purveyors must
stop, for so the law declareth. At present
two professional clubs are in the tield â
the National Sporting and the Twentieth
Century. The latter has the date for
February and proposes the bringing of
Sharkey* and McCoy together on the 2Sth
day of that month. What the March fight
will be is not yet known.
The Twentieth Century Club is experi
encing the test throes of fight labor.
Through Jim Kennedy McCoy and
Sharkey have been matched tor a twenty
round go. Much advent comment and
caustic criticism has been heaped upon
the heads of the directors of this new club
for matching McCoy and Sharkey, upon
whom the cloak ot fistic fraud has fallen
at one time or another in' their ring
career*. The club, composed of a number
of reputable young business men, feels
that it can force the two wieldtrs of fists
to fight on the square. This may prove
an herculean task, but the ntw ciub will.
nevertheless, try it. The following letter
will show how the Twentieth Cenrury
Â«*lub intends to work in order to secure
honest fighting on the part of the prin
cipals: ,
January 18, 1301.
To thÂ» Sporting Editor of The Call-Dear Sir:
The matching of Kid McCoy and Thomas
Fhaikey to meet in a boxing contest under the
auspices of the Twentieth (Century Athletic
dub on February Â£*> has been tubjected to
t-ome criticism, the charge being made that
the men will not compete with the earnest
ness tliat is desired In a boxing content, and it
has even been tmegeeted that they are Incap
able of furnishing an Interesting exhibition.
To all cf these thir.rs the directors of the
club have given the utmost consideration.
The articles of agreement call for the men
to supply "â¢ contest to the satisfaction of the
board of directors. To accomplish the lntend
mertiÂ« of the articles a large eum of money
vtill be exacted from the contestants.! which will

Thip money will bÂ» paid to a Charitable ln
t-titution and the men will receive absolutely
nothing. Furthermore, the directors will pay
daily visit* to the training quarter* and will
do everything in their power to insure a con
tent that will satisfy the most ardent devotee
of thÂ« sport.

Before tha Legislature met It was
thought that the California Game Pro
tective Association had taken on new life,
but there seems little reason to fear that
the legislators now assembled will further
tinker with the game laws as they stand.
Some changes may be instituted, but It is
not likely that they will prove of a radical
nature.
Duck shooters are reaping their re
wards on the marshes, though to hear
them tell their shooting tales nothing but
ill luck waits upon them. The reason of
this is found in tha meeting of the Legis
lature, which is a bogey in the eye of
every sportsman who goes out for wild

McGovern, rather his manager, has been
giving local promoters several kinds of
nu-ntal lashings. The National Sporting
Club, the Twentieth Century Club and
even one or two individual operators have
telegrams in their pockets denoting some
vague sort of promise that binds Terry in
just as Vague sort of way. Manager Har
ris may certainly have his pick of clubs
and mf>n for his little whirlwind. Jim
Kennedy, who is the professional match
maker of the Twentieth Century Club, has
wired that McGovern is secured for a late
April date. The match of all matches
would be McGovern and Erne at 133
pounds. McGovern has grown heavier
during- the last six months and should
concede this weight to Erne.
Tommy Ryan has been heard from
again. Xow that the only fat purses are
to be found In San Francisco, the shifty
middle-weight is anxious to try out this
city. He offers to post any old kind of
forfeit to be on the spot when the time
comes and fight as no man ever fought
before. What he desires particularly is a
match with the winner of the Root-Byers
match.
So it looks as if McCoy and Sharkey
were matched again, this time to fight in
San Francisco. As preliminaries the
Twentieth Century Club will look for such
men as Kid McFadden and a suitable con
testantâRufe Turner, Young Peter Jack
son and one or two others on the list.
As to the statement made that the club has
engaged an Kastem referee, we desire to state
most emphatically that the best local man will
tof secure.! to act in that capacity. This ref
eree will be Instructed by the directors to de

of the Twentieth Century Athletic Club that
ihe principals of this fight have not trained
faithfully and honestly, or that some fraud
has b*en concocted by them or their managers,
the directors of this club will, even at the
eleventh hour, declare the match off.
This is not the first time these men have
met. Two years since they came together
before the LÂ»-nox Club, and the sporting writ
ers i>f the country at that time stated that
the contest was one of the most evenly waged
and exoitinff of any heavy-weight event that
had taken place. This should most certainly
refute the suggestion that the men are not
capable of furnishing an interesting exhibition.

WOODWARD'S Pavilion was
packed to the gallery win
dows last night with a crowd
of eager, flght-thirsty. shout
ing enthusiasts, who did not
shout In vain. They saw a fierce and
furious twenty-round bout between Otto
Cribb of Australia and Charles Thurston
of Saa Francisco that ended In a draw.
After that they saw a nine-round fistic
affair, more scientific but less tumultuous,
that ended in a complete victory for
"Jack" Root and a knockout for George
Byers of Boston.
It in safe to say that no such fight as
that of Cribb and Thurston was ever seen
in this city before. For fierce onslaughts,
terrific batterings, unquestioned and phy
sically heroic gameness Thurston has no
equal In the business. And Cribb proved
his mettle by accepting no small meed of
punishment. In the sixteenth round, when
the sailing was fair and the fight looked
Cribb all over, Thurston crossed his right
full smack upon the Australian's jaw.
The Antipodean went down, but not out,
as was first thought. Many anotherâ and
hardy fighters at thatâ would have cov
eted the ring floor for ten seconds on
such a punch, but not Cribb. He got up
dazed end bewildered, fought his round
out under the most fearful odds and came
back for the next round strong enough
to hold on. At the end of the twentieth
round Cribb was lighting stronger than
his sturdy opponent. Referee "Jack"
Welch called it a draw. The decision was
eminently satisfactory to all.
From the Btart to the finish the fight
was a flstic whirlwind. "This can't last
five rounds," was heard all over the build
ing at the end of the second three-minute
spasm. It lasted five and five more and
five after that before anything like a ces
sation of the pugilistic storm showed on
the horizon. Then came the eventful six
teenth, when the first brake was put on.
Two rounds of comparatively subdued
fighting followed, and then they lashed
at one another again. How long they
would have continued Is conjectural, the
limit of human endurance seeming: to
have no place in the forecast of a fight
between Cribb and Thurston.
Thurston and Cribb furnished a twenty-
course dinner of heavy dishes, any one of
which would have satisfied the average
ring-goer. Were it not for the sixteenth
round Cribb would have proved himself
the winner. Once in a while Cribb would
be knocked down, not by telling blows. but
when he was off his balance. In the thir
teenth round Cribb clearly showed a su
periority in hitting ability and ring com
portment. After that Thurston was on'
the defensive, though strong, active and
eager when the two men mixed. So the
flght went until the sixteenth.
This furnished enough heart excitement
for the crowd to last a month. â¢ By a
swift and sure right cross Thurston
caught his antagonist on the proper spot.
Cribb went down and then scrambled to
his feet when eight second had been called
on him. Then he showed how a fighter
could save himself by ducking and clinch
lngt Five times he went down on the
floor, but managed to stay the round and
the fight. The seventeenth and eight
eenth rounds found Cribb a bit weak, but
in the nineteenth and twentieth he was
the aggressor and the stronger of the
pair.
While the fight was not of the scientific
order, it was supercharged with exciting
situations. Cribb was waiting all the time
to shoot his right on Thurston's chin.
He never connected Just as he planned,
but Thurston did. The fight was a wild,
roaring hurricane, with never a stop. The
crowd was on edge, expecting any. time
to see a wind-up of hostilities. With all
the beating Thurston received all there
was to show for it was a cut on- the left
cheek, received in the eighteenth round.
The last fightâ Root and Byersâ was
not first last night. The fierce precursor
left the flght thirst and hunger of the
audience satisfied. The tame, more scien
tific fighting of Root as he whipped his
left into Byers' face and his right Into his
stomach, and the half-hearted attaches of
the colored man failed to stir. a crowd
that was sated to tho full. Root started
out at the beginning with cautious left
leads, landing full but not- heavily on
Byers' face. For two rounds Root did all
the leading, but an occasional counter by
his opponent forced him to take matters
easy. In the third round Root was after
his man all the time, but Byers never lost
his balance and seemed ready to shoot in
a stiff left or right whenever the opening
came. In the fourth round Root was
more aggressive, boring into Byers per
sistently, yet cautiously. At the end of
SAN FRANCISCO
CLUB BIDS
this round both men returned to their cor
ners none the worse for wear.
The fifth was more exciting. After some
light and ineffectual work Root 5 landed
heavily with; his right' on. Byers' midriff.
The colored man" winced and -backed to
ward the ropes on the other, side -of the
ring. Then Root swung left and right at
Byers' head.wrhis was, done. quickly and
seemingly -. without** full r steam. v. ; Byers
dropped on his haunches -and : remained
there amid the" cries of "Fake! Fake!
Fake!" on the part of the spectators. But
Byers did not .wait the necessary ten sec
onds. He got. up, but was soon knocked
down again, -and the same cries came
from the' spectators. Byers stayed the
round out.< fighting at its close.
In the sixth round Root kept boring into
Byers incessantly, using a stiff / straight
left with good execution. Byers seemed
rattled, trying to save himself at every
occasion. Â¦
The seventh was one of a sinking and
rising characterâ for Byers. Five times
he was knocked down, waiting each time
for the ninth second before rising. Every
time Root shot his left or right into
Byers' body Byers would almost double
up and topple ever. '
Coming up in gay fashion,for the eighth
Byers was soon put on the floor, but this
round lasted its limit. In the ninth the
end came, when after a succession of left
and right Jolts en the head Root put the
Bostonian flat on the boards, and this
time the referee had a chance to count ten
seconds before Byers recovered. Some of
the crowd cried "fake" again, others "cold
feet," while others applauded. Byers was
badly, beaten about the head, with a
nasty cut over Ihe left eye. Root was un
scathed. . The Chicagban fought a clean,
clever, scientific fight, and, if Byers was
at his best last night, outclassed his op
ponent so completely as to admit of no
question of his superiority. Jack Welch
refereed both the big events.
The curtain-raiser was a five-round eo
between George Currin and Jack Woods
Currin was touted the winner but Woods
proved a surprise. After five rounds of
earnest fighting, with some fairly clever
work interspersed, both men were on their
feet and Referee' Joe King shook his finger
at Wood as the winner. The decision was
satisfactory to the crowd. In the second
round Wood, after a stiff left and right,

The diminutive piece of racing material
Maggie Davis ' was returned a winner
again at Oakland yesterday. Only the
day before she disposed of quite a select
array of. selling platers, and with 99
pounds In the saddle, and but six furlongs
to reel off, ruled a 7 to 5 chance for tha
Our Climate handicap. Dominick got
Maggie . away in the lead and although
Joe Frey at one time looked dangerous
she won smiling In l:13Â»i, a remarkably
good performance. Wooster Boy, with his
120 pounds assignment, appeared all at
sea. 1 and Theory, | with a like impost,
never saw any service on tho firing line.
By Judicious handling, Mounce finished
third on Willie Sink's Isaline, which ran
a very clever race.
The track, while good, was still slow,
but by this afternoon ought to be again
in fast condition. The pleasant weather
attracted a large attendance and the bet
ting was about the liveliest of the week.
Three favorites, a second choice and two
outsidersâ Dr. Boyle and Moonbrightâ
had their numbers displayed as winners.
Mr. Caldwell. did have a high old time
with the nine' ragged looking selling plat
ers which started in the opening five and
a half furlong sprinU Not. until twenty
flve minutes had been consumed was a
start accomplished, putting the crowd In
anything but- good humor. In a driving
finish at the wire, E. Matthews, on the
7 to 1 shot. Dr. Boyle, was given a nose
decision over Little Mlnch Jr. Burdock,
probably the best backed horse in the
race, did not begin running until the last
furlong, then taking the show.
Buchanan by a neat piece of saddle
work, captured the three-year-old purse
with Moonbright, a filly owned by Johnny
Weber and 12 to 1 in the betting. Mounce,
with Scallywag, at one time threatened
to make a runaway affair of it. but his
horse began tiring at the paddock. Moon
bright then went on, winning all out by
a length. A hard drive ensued for the
place, Coburn, astride St. Rica, getting it
trora the favorite, Tony Lepping, by a
-Of the five contenders for the third
number St. Cuthbert looked best and was
made a 7- to 10 favorite. At that price
Dr .Rowell's horse was well backed and
when asked disposed of Mocorito In im
pressive fashion. Saintly ran a close
Sam - Hildreth's Owensboro found the
track, much more to his liking than on
Wednesday, for ihe mile selling run
proved a gift for him. Prestidigitator en
joyed the honors of favoritism and for
six furlongs appeared to Â£ ave * S^
chance. Then he blew up. finishing last.
Owensboro, with Dominick up. was never
headed from flagfail, downing Wyoming
with considerable to spare. Â¦ _
- Nearly all of the big bettors spread their
coin about on Dangerous Maid to win the
final six furlong run, the mare going to
the post a 7 to 5 choice. Breaking from
seventh position Coburn quickly had the
favorite in front and she came home a.
shifty winner from McGyle and Socialist.

-.. No, there is nothing- intentional In this â
nothing human. But we have quite an
other impression if we regard the globÂ«
of Mars and especially if we examine with
care all the details of the Martian maps.
The geographical network of the canals is
so regular, so remarkably designedâ for
these immense straight lines start visibly
from regions where water is concentrated
and finish at fixed points of distribution â
that the more we examine them the les*
we find them natural and the less we can
resist. the idea that these lines represent a
hydrographic system, judiciously con
ceived for the fertilization of a globe very
advanced in its evolution and on which
water has become a rare and precious
vital element.
On the other hand, everybody knows
that the planet Mars turns on its axis in
a little more than twenty-four hours (24
hours 37 min. 22.65 sec.) from west to
east, and when we observe It the spots
on the surface move from right to left.
The planet will reach opposition to the
sun on February 22 next, and then, being
perfectly round, completely lit up by the
sun, It will not have, any phase. At pres
ent the phase, which is somewhat strong
ly marked, is on the left hand. It marks
the terminator, the meridian at the set
ting of the sun. . â¢
The various countries of Mars pass un
der our eyes, moving from right to left
and from the day. toward the night. Of
the globe of Mars to which I have referred
the cloudy belt extends from the three
hundred and fifteenth to the three hun
dred and fiftieth meridian: that is to say,
nearly three hours of rotation. There is,
therefore, nothing surprising in the fact
that on December 8 last, the date of the
dispatch, an observer may have seen for
more than an hour the clouds lit up by
the setting sun.
Mr. Lowell has already published two
enormous volumes filled with documents
on the numerous and Important observa
tions made at his observatory. In these
we find no less than 487 observations of
the terminator (made in 1SM-1899), of
which the greater part show Irregularities
and prominences and the luminous pro
jections which are in question at present,
and 175 made in 1896- 1S97. The astronomeis
of Flagstaff., Messrs. Lowell, Douglas and
Pickering, are also of opinion that the34
luminous points simply represent cloud?
lit 'up by the sun. It is not In this that
we find signs that the planet Is Inhabited
by an Intelligent race more or less resem
bling our. own and even, as we will see,
more intelligent .than ourselves..
If our neighbors in the sky were mak
ing signals to us we would ask why they
chose the hour of the setting sun and a
meridian so obliaue to our view. Would
it not be suggested bv nature herself to
choose daylight and solar reflectors? If
we desired to reply to them we ought on
the contrary to choose the middle of the
night, as Mars gravitates round the sun
In an orbit outside that of the earth, and
when the two planet3 are closest together
it presents to us its hemlsDhere lit up by
the sun, while our olanet presents Us

nCAMILLE FLAMMARION, in an
article recently published in the
Paris Temps, comments on the re
cent projections of light observed
I on the planet Mars at the observ
Â¦ , atory at Flagstaff, Ariz. _.
These luminous projections, says M.
Flammarion, f^re nothing new.' The same
announcement* has been made nearly ev
ery two years for the last fifteen years,
and each time the false Interpretations
made of them have been refuted. But
the public memory is short, and then not
everybody reads astronomical works even
of the most popular kind. What, then, are
these luminous projections?
The planet Mars, .like the terrestrial
globe, is lit by the Bun, which naturally
illuminates only one-half at a time. The
line of separation of the hemisphere thus
lit up from the hemisphere in darkness
(the line termed the "terminator") forms
the limit of the phase, as one can see with
the naked eye in the case of the moon.
Well, it is there, always there, that we
observe these luminous points â that is 'to
say, on the meridian of the rising or the
setting of the sun, and to explain these
Irregularities, these white prominences,
two simple and natural hypotheses pre
sent themselves.
Very high mountains might throw their
summits into the dark hemisphere, as we
see constantly on the moon, and as hap
pens on the earth in the case of isolated
mountains. Clouds still higher than the
mountains and more isolated might offer
the same aspect. Now, if we take a globe
of Mars and examine the region on which
the last projections reported by Mr. Doug
las were seen, we ' find that it was be
tween the three hundred and eighteenth
and three hundred and thirtieth meridian
and on the seventh southern parallel of
latitude. Clouds are very rare in the at
mosphere of Mars, a world that enjoys
great privileges in regard to the almost
permanent clearness of its sky. However,
on examining this globe, you will remark
a white spot (the only one on it) near this
point. ...
The little Icarian Sea forms the left of
the western part of the great long shaped
gulf from the east to the west named
Sinus Sabeus. and if I have indicated
there and there only on the whole planet
a long white mark, it is because I have
often remarked white spots forming a
contrast with the dark tone of the sea
and with the yellow tone of the continent
itself. Other observers have , remarked
this like myself. They cannot be due to
clouds, but to fogs which, when lit up
from above by the sun. are perfectly
white or else to white frost. But this
probability is in favor of fogs, the con
' figuration of the \ ground suggesting the
existence of two chains of mountains sep
arated by a large valley corresponding to
MAP OF MARS, SHOWING THE CANALS. THE BLACK SPOT ON THE
WHITE PORTION, REPRESENTING LAND, IS WHERE THE LUMIN
OUS SIGNALS SEEMED TO COME FROM. .' Â¦ . ';.' ; A

If Sydney Smith were alive to-day ha
would realize that In the lost eighty years
of the century Just closed considerable
progress had been made In this country
more perhaps than in any country in thÂ«
civilized world. It was only in 1820 that
in one of his savage attacks on our peo
ple In the Edlnburg Review he sneeringly
asked:
"In the four cruarters of the globe who.
reads an American book? Or eroes to an

PERSONAL MENTION
WrHENEVER a Western man suggests the ex
penditure of a few millions of Government
money for the irrigation of the arid regions
of the country the East complains of "an alarminij
tendency to loot the treasury," but when it is a ques
tion of supplying more waterways for any part of
the East, then those same people begin to talk loudly
of the duty of the Government "to promote internal
improvements." . -
There are enough canal or deep water projects
urged upon Congress by the East to entail a govern
mental expenditure large enough to Irrigate every
acre of arid land in the West, plant it with roses and
chrysanthemums and build a villa on it with a red
stable in the background.
The country is already familiar with the proposal to
convert the Chicago drainage canal into a ship canal i
which will enable sea-going vessels to pass from Lake
Michigan to the Mississippi and the Gulf. The fur
ther project of constructing a deep water canal from
the lakes to the ocean at New York is also well
known. Those two enterprises alone would cost more
than twice as much as has ever been estimated as
requisite to irrigate all the arid West that is capable
of irrigation. In addition to them there are other
big schemes. Philadelphia wishes the Delaware
River opened so as to make a thirty foot channel to
the sea, but that is a small and modest wish, not
widely different from^ Boston's desire for a forty foot
waterway in her harbor at a cost of only $10,000,000.
A more costly project is that- of constructing an
inland waterway from' Beaufort, N. C, to Boston, on
the one hand, and to the lakes on the other. The
plan is to have the canal start at Norfolk, Va., and
run southward through the Dismal Swamp canal to
Albemarle Sound, thence through Scuppernong-
River to Pimlico Sound, and thence to Beaufort
through the Neuse and Newport canal. Northward
from Norfolk the waterway is to be opened through
Chesapeake Bay, and thence by canal to the
I Delaware River. After that -there is something like
clear sailing for the scheme, for, as a New York ad
vocate of the enterprise says: /'The. Delaware River
is navigable by all craft to Philadelphia, and for ves
sels of considerable size to Bordentown. From. the
fetter city there is canal navigation to the Raritan, at
New Brunswick, and thence, of course, there is a fine
inland waterway to New York. From this city there
I is a cross-country waterway by the Hudson River
land Erie canal to the whole system of Great Lakes
I and the St. Lawrence River. There is also the way
up the coast, by Long Island Sound to " Buzzard?
Bay, and thence, by the construction of a short canal
to Cape Cod Bay and Boston." â¢â¢ -..,<Â¦Â¦ . :
There are some other projects. TheTnew South has
â¢ a yearning for canals. One scheme proposes a canal
I across Florida so as to shorten the route from Gulf
EASTERN WATERWAY PROJECTS.
Of course in repom of that kind. there is always
more or less exaggeration. That much is understood.
It is to be borne in mind, however, that the progress
toward centralization of railroad interests has been
so rapid of late that the exaggerations of one diy
have been understatements on the next: Between the
railroad companies and the express companies there
is now close alliance. In the end itimay please the
magnates of the roads to swallow their allies,' as well
as the coal mines arid the; steer plants.
In addition to the report of those schemes from
New York there come3 another from -Chicago to the
effect -that' Morgan and Hill have been "negotiating
for the purpose of getting control of the express traf
fic- It is stated to be the intention of the combine
to conduct the express business as a regular part of
railroad operation. The report adds: "While noth
ing regarding the plans is obtainable, it is
claimed to.be the intention of the railroad officials to
refuse to renew contracts with the, companies where
the remaining life of the contracts is not long and to
make outright purchases of franchises where the con
tracts still have long lives before them. The ex
press companies have contracts ranging all the way
from" five to twenty years, and at the expiration > 6(
their legal agreements they. are. at the mercy of. the
railroad companies."-
The great railroad deal arranged by J. Pierpont
Morgan and James J. Hill appears to be reaching
after everything that can in any important way^affect
railroads. They have not only discussed the combi
nation of some of, tHje greatest trunk lines of the con
tinent into one system, but they have approached the
Carnegie Company for the purpose of controlling the
steel manufacturing industry so as to command th*
price of rails and other materials of that kind, and.
moreover, they will virtually dominate the coal in
dustry of nearly the whole country north of the Poto
\nzc and east of the Mississippi.
ONLY a short time ago the country was cheered
by reports f rom New ( York that there had
come a reaction against the movement for the
consolidation of great interests under a single man
agement. The statistics showed that while in 1899
the aggregate capitalization of industrial combines
reached the enormous sum of $2,500,000,000, the ag
gregate capitalization of such enterprises last year was
but $945,000,000. So marked a decline as that justi
fied expectation that the worst of the trust scare was
over, but later developments threaten to revive it.
I11 fact, if all reports be true, we are now about to
witness a combination that will come very near being
as big a thing of the kind as can ever be achieved un
less we reach absolute state socialism.
A FAR - REACHING TRUST.
Upon Californians of this generation is imposed
the duty of saving these trees from destruction. It
is a duty whose fulfillment cannot be postponed. Rap
idly are the redwoods falling before the march of
civilization that is ruthless of beauty. If anything of
the srrand old glories of California is to be saved
for the delight of the present and the wonder of the
future the work of salvation must begin now 4 .
The preservation of these great trees is a matter in
which all Californians ought to take an interest. They
constitute one of the chiefest glories of the State.
They are the stately adornments by which nature has
marked out this land as more favored than all else
in the world. Were even a few of them in any part
of Europe they would have been in ancient days the
chief objects of Druidic veneration and through all
ages since the subjects of royal care. They would
be renowned in song and story, and the four corners
of the world would long ere this have rung with the
Lme of their majesty snd their beauty.
It will be noted the Hll does not specify any par
ticular tract of land. The commission is to be free to
search the State over and select such tract as in the
judgment of the Commissioners will be best fitted to
j reserve a forest of the giant redwoods. The Semper
virens Club has, however, prepared a written and il
lustrated argument in favor of the Big Basin. It con
tains photographs of scenes within that forest show
ing not only views of the general landscape but pic
tures of several of the largest, oldest and most mag
nificent trees. The photographs reveal the beauty of
the place and the hugeness of the giants of the wood.
In themselves they constitute a valid justification for
the appeal the club has made.
The bill provides for the creation of a commission to
be composed of the Governor of the State, the presi
dent of the University of California, the president of
Stanford University, and two other Commissioner*
to be appointed by the Governor. The commission
is to select a tract of land within the State upon
vhich are growing trees known as Sequoia semper
virens, and which is most suitable for a park whose
j.urpose is to preserve a body of those trees from
destruction. It is provided that the land shall not
exceed $500,000 in cost, and that the sum of $250,000
shall be immediately appropriated to be used by the
commission solely for the purchase of land for the
proposed nark.
THE Sempervirens Club has presented to the
Legislature a bill designed for the purpose of
saving from destruction "a forest of the oldest
end largest trees on earth." The forest stands in
what is known as the "Big Basin" of the Santa Cruz
Mountains, and is well situated to serve as a wood
land for the study and cultivation of forestry by the
students of the two great universities of the State,
and also as a grand holiday park and recreation
ground for all who desire a summer outing under
ideal conditions. The effort made by the Semper
virens Club to save the forest is therefore worthy the
co-operation of the public of the whole State.

It is not easy to determine what should be done to
remedy the evil, but it is worth noting the United
States Government recently compelled railroad cor
porations to adopt the improvement of automatic
couplings, and 'it would seem, therefore, that intelli
gent governmental supervision and regulation might
compel telegraph and telephone companies to accept
improvements which are calculated to be of service
to the public. It is well understood that while great
combinations in control of the public utilities and
industries of the country are productive of much good,
they also bring many evils in their train, and among
those evils is that of, checking the improvements
which men of scientific attainments and mechanical
skill are now capable of devising for the advancement
of civilization.
The statement occurs in an interview with Edison
recently, published in the Western Electrician. He is
quoted as having said: "There is no incentive to-day
to any one to devote time or money' in attempting to
increase the rapidity of telegraphic communication in
this country. As you very well know, telegraphy in
the United States is in the hands of financiers', and
any business man will understand me when I say that
it is only too .evident that the present policy of the
great companies is to 'let wellenough alone.' "
This statement contains the clear' imputation that
the big telegraph corporations, being no longer urged
by- the rivalry of competing companies to make im
provements in their lines and increase the facilities
for telegraphic communication, are deliberately hold*
ing-back improvements because they do not wish to
go to the expense, of altering their plants.
If that be true of telegraph companies, and Edison
is in a position to know the truth, it must be equally
true of the corporations that control telephone com
panies. It is quite probable that if there were any
thing like competing telephone lines available to spur
one another on to improvement there would be a
much better system of telephoning in use by thi3
time. Science and invention are, in fact, held back
by corporate interests, and the new century begins the
work of rivaling the nineteenth in progress with that
handicap upon its efforts.
BY reason of his many extraordinary statements
Tesla has managed for some time past to oc
cupy a much larger space in the columns of
sensational journals than any other experimenter in
this country along lines of electrical development.
His recent suggestion of the possibility of communi
cating with Mars is a specimen of the means by which
he makes his bids for fame, or rather for notoriety.
In comparison with such declarations Edison has
been quiet, and yet he has m?de an assertion which
has far more claim upon the attention of intelligent
men than anything Tesla has said or done in five
years.
HOLDING BACK IMPROVEMENT.
MISMANAGEMENT (KT SflN QUENTIN.
The issue confronts the Legislature. It cannot be
ignored and it must not be evaded. An investigation
must take place. It can hardly be necessary to ad-1
that when made the investigation should be thorough.
It should not be confined to the circumstances con
cerning this particular case; it should bring to light
the whole system of prison management and make
clear the practices by which that system is carried out
iiÂ« daily operation. Reorganization, as Mr. Wilkins
says, is a necessity, but before it is undertaken it
should be made known wherein the present manage
ment is defective and who are to blame for the de
fects either of method or of practice.
Upon that showing Prison Director Wilkins is cer
'tainly justified in declaring: "A thorough reorgani
zation of the present prison methods is a necessity."
To what extent the State has suffered by the de
falcations of Walden and the neglect of duty on the
part of his superiors is not yet known. In comment
ing upon that phase of the question Prison Director
Wilkins stated in ah interview: "The loss to the
State by Walden's defalcations may reach as high as
$50,000, although as yet we know of only $2750. From
our expert's report and the investigation of detectives
I believe the stealing has been going on for a number
of years â in fact, almost since Walden took his place.
The man Levy admitted to me this morning- that he
had had other dealings with Walden., than those
we have discovered, and I think it likely that yet other
receivers of stolen goods will be found."
Passing from the particular case which has been
brought to light to a general view of the subject Mr.
Wilkins went on to say: "If Walden did any stealing
previous to September 9 of last year Clerk Joseph
Ellis, of the Prison Board must have been aware of
his defalcations, and the thefts probably extend over
a period of years. We believe they did. Certainly
Walden must have had confederates at the prison. The
business management of this institution has been lax
and disgraceful. In every administration affairs have
been loosely conducted, artd the present one of Mar
tin Aguirre is no exception to the rule. Since Sep
tember 9 we have had no clerk of the Prison Board,
and no attempt has been made to see if sacks were
delivered. Before that date the sacks were dumper!
on a wharf in San Francisco and whoever called for
them took them away. The clerk of the board was
supposed to find out if the sacks were delivered, and
if while that official was holding office any thefts were
made he must have been an accomplice."
No valid reason can be given to justify the appoint
ment of Walden to a position of such trust, nor, in
deed, can it be even so much as excused. The office
should have been assigned to some man of knowa
honesty who has a family to support and who, being
a good citizen, merits the position. Instead of be
stowing the place -upon a worthy man the prison
authorities conferred it upon an ex-convict, gave him
a large freedom of action in the conduct of the busi
ness of the office and then left him without that super
vision which shoald have been exercised over even
the most honest man who might have been employed
ir. the place.
Upon the very face of the facts there is evidence
of bad judgment* to say the least. An ex-convict em
ployed in a capacity of great responsibility and trust
lias apparently been permitted to have an a.most free
hand in control of the sale of sacks from the prison
mill. His previous bad character, though well known
to the Warden and to all in authority, was seemingly
no warning to them of his weakness and no sugges
tion that they should put around him the watchfulness
needed not only to protect the property of the State
*but to prevent him from feeling the temptations that
would lead him to add other frauds and crimes to
those of which he had been already convicted.
BY the publication of the facts concerning the
fraud practiced by C. J. Walden in the sale of
sacks stolen from the jute mill at San Quentin
The Call has exposed something more than the dis
honesty of that cx-clcrk " and ex-convict. It has
brought to light the carelessness or worse of the
prison authorities and exposed a condition of affairs
that renders investigation imperative.
ports to Atlantic ports. Another project is to have
an inland waterway from Savannah, Ga., to* Wilming
ton, N. C, and so on; to connect with the northern
waterway. In short, anything that promises^ a water
way by which to empty the United States treasury
along the Atlantic coast or down the Mississippi-Val
ley is regarded as a legitimate work of the Govern
ment. In the meantime the West is exhorted to pay
taxes and to abstain from; looting the treasury. "~

The schooner Czarina, owned by the

Point. Yesterday news reached San
Francisco that on December 6 she was
driven high and dry on the beach in
Pavlof harbor, Sannak Island. There is
$15,000 insurance on the hull and the un
derwriters say she will, be got off. The
captain and crew attempted to dig a canal
through which to float the schooner to
sea, but failed in the attempt. A tug will
be sent north to try and tow the stranded
vessel off.
Men who know the spot on which the
Czarina is stra/ided say she will never
come off. According to them she is on a
rocky shore and her keel is gone
and she is otherwise much damaged. The
Czarina was built for th.j codnshing busi
ness and has been engaged in it for years.
The schooner Anna is owned by the
Alaska Codfish Company and she left San
l"rancisco for Sand Point on November 22.
Since then she has never been spoken.
On December 22 a mail left most of the
Alaskan ports, but Sand Point advices
said she had not arrived there. Still,
driven by stress of weather, the captain
may have put into some port of refuge
and all may yet be well.

Czarina Reported Wrecked and the
p:-tT^HE British steamer Condor, which
I irrived here from Iquique with a
H cargo of nitrate a few days ago,
*J_l had . a very narrow escape from
coming to a dead stop at sea.
When she finally made port there was not
enough coal in the bunkers to make
steam in the donkey boiler and in conse
quence a scow laden with "black dra
monds" â¢ had- to be. put alongside before
the steamer could move from her anchor
age. It took some time to get steam up
in the "donkey" boiler. and then when the
anchor, was raised. a tug had to take the
tramp to the Oakland long wharf. Had
there been any coal left the Condor would
have gone to Port Costa direct and saved
the owners of the nitrate ' considerable
money.
There is little or no coal to be procured
at the nitrate ports and when the Condor
was ready to sail for San Francisco the
captain found that he could not get, fuel
for love or money. The steamer was
twenty-five days -coming up and lust
escaped the hurricane that has done so
much damage along the coast. Had she
run into it the chances are her coal would
have been burned up and she would have
been a helpless derelict.

view with Jefferson Davis, "and start out thÂ«
Baldinsvill Mounted Hosb Cavalry! I'm capt
ing of that corpse, I am, and J. Davis, be
ware! Jefferson D., I now leave you! Fare
well, my gay Saler Boy! Good-by. my bold
buccaneer! Plrut of the deep blua sea, adoo.
adoo."
He delighted In sly hits at the over-ro
mantlc, at the artificiality of stage diction
and at fine writing generally.
It will be seen that one element of the
humor of Artemus Ward liea in his un
usual coinages of words. Some of his ef
forts are really surprising:
"Let us glide," I said, "In the mazy dance."
and we Klode.
Alexander the Great was punklns, but Napo
leon was punklnses.
I said, "Why these weeps?"
Again they asked me to marry them, and
again I declined. When they cried. "O cruel
man! this is too much â oh, too much!" I told
them it was on account of the muchness that
I declined.
Of all the odd things that he saw, the
Mormons delighted him most. He never
tired of dwelling on their peculiarities:
Their religion is singular, but their wives are
plural. â .
I regret to say that efforts were made to
make a Mormon of me while I was In Utah.
It was leap year when I was there, and
seventeen young widowsâ the wives of a de
ceased Mormon (he died by request)â offered
me their hearts and hands. I called upon them
one day, and taking their soft white hands In
mineâ which made eighteen hands altogetherâ
I found them in tear3. and I said, "Why la
this thus? What is the reason of this thus
ness?" -.Â¦'Â¦
They hove a sighâ seventeen sighs of differ
ent size. They said, "Oh, soon thou wilt be
gonested away 1 ."
I told them that when I got ready to leave a
place I usually wentested. They said: "Doth
not like us?"
I said, "I doth, I doth!" I also said. "I
hope your Intentions are honorable, as I am a
lone child, and my parents are far. far away!"
They then said: "Wilt not marry us?"
I said. "Oh, no; it cannot was."
The key to Ward's drollery lay in his
peculiar personality. To him the world
was inverted: he saw everything in a
strange, topsy-turvy way. Things that
most people consider beautiful or sublime
or faultless or holy awoke in him an in
voluntary mirth, and the total unpre
paredneas of the mind for his remarks
and observations made them doubly
laughable. The incongruous always at
tracted him; he delighted in picturesque
personalities and communities; the Mor
mons, the Shakers, the free- lovers,
"wimln's rites asscciashuns," the Indians
âindeed, his books furnish a complete list
of the incongruous and unique elements
in the American life and society of his
day.
Often he grew confidential and admitted
his hearers into the secret failings and
private history of his panorama, then sud
denly he would ask to be excused while
he ran up the moon over an evening
scene. An impatient JerKlng and shaking
would then be heard behind tho scenes,
after which the showman would come
forth and blandly ask the audience to
please excuse the moon for that evening,
as it was not In working order; in fact,
he would confide that the crying need of
his show was a good "moonist." After
describing the death of a certain charac
ter In his lecture on the Mormons, he
would suddenly pause and ask that soft,
sad music might be played on the piano.
Charles Farrar ! Browne, "Artemus
Ward," was a native of Waterford, Me.,
born about 1834. Thrown early upon his
own resources, he became a typesetter
and drifted from â¢ office to office until in
1850 he finally reached Boston, where for
three years he set type for the comic
Journal, Mrs. Partington's Carpet Bag.
This apprenticeship -under Shlllaber
doubtless turned' his mind to humor as a
profession, but It was not until 1S57 or 1S5S.
while in Ohio, whither he had drifted,
that he adopted the nom de plume "A.
Ward" and began seriously to contribute
humorous matter to the papers and to de
liver comic lectures. In 1S60 he was In
vited to New York to become editor of
the new humorous weekly. Vanity Fair,
but the venture wa3 unsuccessful. Two
years later he mado a tour through the
extreme West in Bearch of humorous ma
terial, and upon his return he started in
1Â£66 u:>on a lecture tour of England. In
the midst of a brilliant success in Lon
don he died of consumption March 6, 1867.
The essence of "Artemus Ward's" hu
3nor lay first of all in the droll personality
of the man. Much of his "quaint humor,"
says Hawels, who heard him in London,
"could only live at all in that subtle at
mo.sphere which Artemus Ward's presence
created, and In which alone he was ablo
to operate." He was the originator of
what may be called the American manner
of delivering humor. He would set forth
his most telling Jokes with perfect com
posure, 'with an expression almost of sad
ness on his face, and then would look up
with seeming surprise when the audience
burst into, a roar. His methods as a lec
turer were always unexpected. At one
time he was ten minutes late and the
audience grew impatient. At length he
appeared and began to dust the furniture
of the stage. All supposed that he was a
mere assistant, and grew more impatient,
until at length he turned about with the
remark, "Now that everything is all
ready, I will begin." "I can see him now,"
says one who heard him lecture, "as hÂ«*
came on the narrow platform in front of
his inferior panorama and stole a glance
at the densely packed room and then at
his panorama. â¢ â¢ â¢ On first entering he
would seem profoundly unconscious that
anything was expected of him, but after
locking at the audience, then at his own
clothes, and then apologetically at his
panorama, he began to explain its mer
its."
From the great throng of newspaper
comedians who have so filled the latter
half of the century with their fleeting
merriment two have arisen to the secure
heights of literary Immortalityâ the one
through an indescribable drollery which
was nothing short of genius, the other
through a painstaking fidelity to nature
and a broad humanity that lifts many of
his pages far above the realm of the mere
joke book.
the gTeat spirit of literary comedy, with
its well known peculiarities, that swept
over America during the '50s and 'tSOs of
the nineteenth century. But "Mark.
Twain" is far more truly a humorist than
was his earlier rival. Browne was a lit
erary comedian, the prince of literary
comedians to be sure, but only at rare
times was he a true humorist. Much of
"Mark Twain" is mere farce; scattered
through his earlier books axe page after
page of horse play and broad wit and pure
drollery, yet under it all there is a basis
of minute observation of nature, and of
truth to the fundamentals of human life.
In much of his later work there Is a vein
of the truest pathos. Were all the merely
comic parts stricken from his writing he
would still rank as a great humorist.
Few men in a generation have seen so
wide an area of life as "Mark Twain."
Born in a frontier town on the Missis
sippi, he passed his boyhood amid an en
vironment and a society which, to say the
least, was peculiar to America. As a wan
dering printer during a most interesting
epoch he saw through a wide area a pic
turesque phase of our national life. Later
as a pilot on the Mississippi, then as a
Confederate soldier, and still later as a
traveler and Journalist In the wildest por
tions of the Westâ In Virginia City and in
the gold fields of Californiaâ he certainly
saw phases of life that are unique. In
later years he has traveled over most of
the globe and has resided for years at a
time In foreign cities. This cosmopolitan
training has made him the humorit not
of a small locality but of all America. He
is the most purely American type that has
thus far been produced, and he is the most
extensively -read. At the present day ho
is the most widely known of all Ameri
cans, and wherever he is known It is first
of all as a humorist. Ills books are read
in every language, and wherever they are
read they excite mirth, which proves that
his humor is of the universal type, an at
tribute of humor conferred only on a few
of the supreme masters.
In many ways it has been a positive loss
to the world that "Mark Twain" first be
came known as a great Joker. Nothing
that he writes is taken seriously. His
audience Is on a broad grin before he says
a word. He has complained that his most
serious work has time and again been
taken as comic, and all the effect upon
which he had counted therefore lost. As
a matter of fact, large areas of his works
were written in dead earnest; yet fate has
decreed that do what he may his truth
will read as lf it were a lie. and vice versa.
He has a rich vein of poetry in his na
ture; some of his descriptions of land
scapes are as good as anything of the
kind that we have in the language, and he
Is also a careful depicter of character and
of human nature. Tom Sawyer. Huckle
berry Finn and Pudd'nhead "Wilson are
drawn with Intense realism, both as to
themselves and their backgrounds.
He was not so much of a wit as Browne.
He does not flash and scintillate. His
humor is often like an atmosphere that
pervades a work. He is harder to quoteâ
indeed, the law may be positively stated
that the more genuine the humorist the
harder he is to quote. His humor comes
first of all from his minute powers ot
observation. He is wide awake and he
sees everything; no absurdity escapes
him. no sham, i.o Insincerity, no grotesque
incongruity. He ridicules the tourist who
is doing Europe in four weeks and who la
full of push and exclamation. He refuses
to show emotion at the tomb of Columbus,
but he weeps at the grave of Adam. "In
nocents Abroad" is a. book oftravels re
versed. It is Europe stripped of Its halo
and seen through the eyes of a keen, prac
tical, matter-of-fact Yankee, without rev-
Of "Mark Twain's" exaggeration and Ir
reverence little need be said. It is only a
minor phase of hts humor, yet It Is always
telling.
ThÂ« stage driver said the Apaches used to
annoy him all the time when he was on the
southern overland, and that he came as near
as anything to starving 1 to death in the midst
of abundance, because they kept him so leaky
with bullet holes that he couldn't hold his
vittlea. - . -.
Salt Lake City was healthyâ an extremely
healthy city. They declared there was only
one physician In the place .and he was ar
rested every week regularly and held to an
swer under the vagrant act for having "no
visible means of support."
The well-known description of the coyote
In "Roughlns It" is a mixture of exag
geration and of really accurate descrip
tion. Despite its caricature it is one of the
best pictures of this peculiarly American
creature in literature.
Thereis a naivo innocence about his
humor that is peculiarly his own device.
He gives such an air of plausibility to
even his wildest tales that it often takes
a real effort to disbelieve them. The read
er who has followed the author innocent
ly and unsuspectingly suddenly finds him
self brought up with a sudden turn
against a wild absurdity and then realizes
all at once that the author has been skill
fully leading him to this very point. The
surprise and the sudden incongruity cre
ate laughter.
The author relates an experience where
he nearly perished with hunger. He tells
how he was driven to eat his boots, then
comes the sudden remark, "The holes
tasted best."
For years my pet aversion had been the
cuckoo clock; now here I was, at last, right
In the creature's home; so whererer I went
that distressing "hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo!"
was always In my ears. For a nervous man
this was a fine state of things. Some sounds
are hatefuller than others, but no sound Is
quite so inane and silly and aggravating as
the "hoo-hoo" of a cuckoo clock. I think. I
bought one and am carrying it home to a.
certâ In person's, for I have always said that
if the opportunity ever happened I would do
that man an ill turn. What I meant was
that I would break one of his legs, or some
thing of that sort; but in Lucerne I Instantly
saw that I could Impair his mind. That would
be more lasting and more satisfactory every
way, so I bought the cuckoo clock; and If I
ever gat home with it "he Is my meat." as
they say in the mines. I thought of another
candidate â a book reviewer. whom I could
name If I wanted toâ but after thinking it
over I didn't buy him a clock. I couldn't In
jure his mind.
There Is. too, a peculiar drollery about
his way of expressing himselJ that re
minds us of Artemus Ward:
Take it all around, there Is quite a good
deal of Information in the book. I regret this
very much, but really It could not be helpedâ
Information appears to stew out of me nat
urally, like the precious ottar of roses out of
thÂ« otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me
that I would give worlds if I 'could retain my
facts: but It cannot be. The more I calk up
the sources and the tighter I get the more I
leak wisdom.
The Mormon bible is chloroform In print.
Of his shrewd common sense and epi
grammatic wls<?.om the extracts from
Pudd'nhead 'Wilson's calendar axe the
best examples. His pathos and his refined
sentiment breathe from every page of
"Joan of Arc" are freely and sprinkled
through all of his later books.
"Mark Twain" Is more than a mere
Jesterâ he Is a philosopher, a literary
artist, a minute realist, a keen observer
of life, a satirist, a reformerâ a humorist
In the highest sÂ»Â»nse. He "Is universally
recognized as the first of living humor
ists: but lf the fashion of humor changes,
as change it may, he will remain for other
qualities â certain primordial qualities,
such as are expressed in his work on the
Mississippi â a force to be reckoned with
In the literature of this country."

tary.
Associated Charities Elect Officers.
President Jordan was at his office earlv
this morning, evidently in the best of
health and spirits.; He feels that his
statement made last night covers all that
W jKf- t0 *Jf Ba i d ?? the sub Ject, so would
add nothing further to-day.
We sincerely deplore the forces which have
resulted In your resignation, and we further
take this opportunity of expressing to you our
admiration for the dignified attitude which you
and those of the faculty who resigned -with
you have maintained throughout the present
crisis.
To Dr. George E. Howard: We. the under
signed students of Stanford University unaual
lfledly indorse the position you have main
tained with regard to the questions of deep im
portance which havp recently arisen in the uni
versity.
We cannot, however, express our rerret at
losing you from our faculty. Tour Influence
has been felt not only by those of us who have
known you personally, but it has permeated the
whole being of the university. Upon the stu
dents the effect of contact with you has been
that of the Ideal teacher. The place you have
occupied in the life of the university cannot
be refilled.
The second resolution is for those who
believe that the first one is not strong
enough and who wish to go upon record
as sympathizing with Dr. Howard It is
as follows:
To Dr. George Elliott Howard: Fearing- the
action of the Associated Students in affirming
their faith In President Jordan may be misun
derstood by you, we, as of those who supported
Â¦uch action, wish to offer you an explanation.
You will readily realize that we have been
confronted by an extremely delicate situation
On the one hand we have had to consider our
duty to the university,. and on the other the
rlghti, convictions and unquestioned sincerity
of those membera of the faculty most con
cerned, and the debt we owe them for what
they have Riven us of themselves during. our
association with them. In reaching our final
decision simply to declare the confidence we
feel In Dr. Jordan, it has seemed best to us
to leave out of consideration altogether the
merits of the controversies which have arisen
We have followed what has appeared the only
course fairly open tÂ« us as students and bene
ficiaries. Â«
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 1S.-
After the rousing student body meeting
sustaining Dr. Jordan and the magnificent
reception given him last night on his re
turn affairs at the university have once
more resumed their normal condition
The great majority of the students feel
that their action of yesterday "closes the
incident," so far as the students are con
cerned. However, several resolutions are
being circulated by those who feel that
the action yesterday failed to take Into
account the feelings of Dr. Howard and
desire to assure him of their good will
There are two l set3 of resolutions being
circulated, but the second one is in the
hands of the men who sympathize most
strongly with Dr. Howard and wish to
go on record as favoring him. The fol
lowing of the latter class Is especially
small, as the general sentiment among the
students is to let the matter rest where
yesterday's resolution left it. They argue
that anything in the way of resolutions
circulated among the students is In u
manner public agitation, which the stu
dents should be the last to foster. The
first of the resolutions now being circu
lated is as follows:
Special Dispatch to The Call
Two Resolutions Being Cir
culated Among Stan
ford Students.
EXPRESS ESTEEM
FOR DR. HOWARD
As for the Pacific Charter Company
carrying out its plans," Mr. Bennett con
tinued I can say nothing. Everything
Is In the air at present, and we are sim
ply waiting developments. Our company
may be succesful and it may not be "
Arthur B. Tarpey. another of the incor
porators. declined to say anything in con
nection with the corporation or Its plans
He contented .himself with the promise
that out of the first bunch of coolies
brought from China he will save a Chi
nese cook for The Call. His father. M. F
Tarpey, could not be seen.
It would take a hundred years," said
Mr. Bennett yesterday, "to import that
many Chinese, and, besides, we are not
interested in that matter anyway. While
the Mexican Government has placed the
Chinese upon as favorable a footing as
any other nation, our company is con
cerned In something else. We did expect
to bring over a few Chinese, but not near
the number published in The Call.
"Far down on the south coast, near the
Isthmus of Tehauntepec, are admirable
fishing grounds, and a healthy climate fa
vorable to Chinese, But our main purpose
Is to engage in transportation from Eu
rope to the Mexican coast, across the
Isthmus of Tehauntepec and from there
to Asia. Traffic would come both ways
and would be very profitable, particu
larly before the construction .of the
Mcarague canal. The Isthmus of Tehaun
tepec Is only 240 miles, and a railroad la
now being built there. As for our offers
to local Chinese, we only wanted to let
them In on a good thing/' And Mr. Ben
nett smiled so blandly that there was
not the slightest doubt that he meant
what he said.
You should appoint a committee to or
ganize a company at once, for we must
make haste and not allow such a valuable
matter to remain standing.
"It Is not necessary that the persona
who become the incorporators should re
main the permanent officers of the com
pany but when you have a stockholders'
meeting you can elect what officers you
desire and the incorporators will only
serve the purpose of Incorporating. You
should become Incorporated at once. Then
the stock con be subscribed and after
subscriptions of stock are made a stock
holders meeting can be called and per
manent officers efected."
Company Gives Away Good Things.
These are the plans of the Pa'ciflc Char
ter Company as far as they relate to the
Chinese merchants and fishing bosses of
San Francisco. But John E. Bennett,
one of the leading promoters of the cor
poration and the friend of Ho Yow, says
that the Pacific Charter Company is con
cerned primarily neither with the Chinese
merchants of San Francisco nor the im
portation of one million coolies into Mex
ico.
cession you are getting for nothing, be
cause the $25,000 which you will pay for
5000 shares of the Pacific Charter Com
pany's stock Is only about one-fifth of
what the stock will be worth within the
next two years.
"It is plain to see that this project
means a fortune for every one connected
t}} 1 lt- lt is safe to SHy that your stock
will become worth manv times its face
value for the earnings will be very large.
;t js the best opportunity ever offered the
Chinese people on the American conti
nent.
The Coroner's office was not long In de
c?<1;ng that the daughter should be al
lowed to have her wish, notwithstanding
that the hrothcr claimed priority because
he wa? oMrr.
"I am too proud." she said, "to consent
to having my poor father buried by char
ity fo long hp I have the means to defray
thÂ» funeral expenses."
Tears stood in Miss Kahn'* eyes as she
asked the Coroner's deputies to allow her
to take her father's remains away with
her.
IFis eon Henry and his daughter Louise
eppeared at the Coroner's office yester
day, both claiming the body for inter
ment. Ijouise faid that ehe had made ar
rar.pcmpnts with Porter & White to give
her father a decent burial, but that her
brother Her.rv had gone to the firm of
Cahn. Nickel^berg & Co.. where her
father had been employed, to collect
money with which to pay the burial ex
jer.Â«ps rnd had engaged Valente & Ma
rini as the undertakers. She had pleaded
Â¦with hÂ«r brother, ehe raid, not to allow
th^ir father to b* buried by charity, and
phe had made all arrangements to have
him buried otherwise. Her brother in-
FiMed that his programme should be car
ried out and tried to impress upon her
mind the fact that he was older than
the. and that his wishes in the matter
should have preference.
The melancholy spectacle of a brother
end s'.ster engaged in controversy as to
the disposition of their dead father's body
Â¦was witrseFsed in the Coroner's office yes
terday afternoon. The dead man was
Henry Kahn. who died suddenly of apo
plexy last Thursday and whose body wad
tskf-n to the Morgue. "

PLEAD FOR BODY
OF THEIR FATHER
In the second place, the man who caused
the circular to be translated into Chinese
and prepared for distribution among Chi
r.f** merchants Is John E. Bennett, the
personal attorney of Ho Yow. Chinese
Consul General at this port. Ho Yow has
jriven us frequent and highly commenda
ble Indications that he is a pretty good
promoter himself, but every one con
cerned in this affair declares positively
that Ho Tow is not in the slightest de
tree interested or concerned.
It is i-asy to understand, therefore, that
a circular such as the Pacific Charter
Company has had translated into Chinese
would naturally appeal to Chinese mer
chants and might induce them to take
Ftock in the enterprise. It is significant
of course that the Pacific Charter Com
pany has made so determined an effort to
induce local Chinese to buy stock in the
corporation with the promise that it pre
cents the greatest opportunity on the
American continent f^r Chinese to become
rich. It Is interesting to see with what
FfMiritude the promoters of the Pacific
Charter Company seek to secure riches
for local Chinese mercnams.
Ho Yow and Chinese Merchants.
'i i.rre are several phases of this circu
lar and several incidents in connection
Â¦vriih its preparation which are of more
than passing Interest. In the first place,
local Chinese merchants have always
prove i tliTnpelves to be very quick to
accept an opportunity to make easy
mnney. They are not altogether scrupu
lous in regard to the manner in which
thÂ«=y malie it and they are notorious
Fmupplers. So oagfr are they to make
m^ney that on many occasions they have
h*en hoodwinked by schemers more clever
tV.an themselves.
The promoters of the enterprise admit
that they have done nothing as yet to
ward its practical realization. No steam-
Fh'.p s have been ordered, much less built
or hired. The Pacific Charter Company
has no warehouses, canneries or freight
dppotP in Mexico and the prospective 1,
Â«KÂ».(*Â» coolies are Mill safe on the Asiatic
shore. The only definite thing which has
born done is to print the remarkable Chi
nese circular, with iti glowing pictures of
rnormoue. quickly won wealth, for dis
tribution among the local Chinese mer
chants.
Business men. politicians, speculators
and promoters generally grinned knowing
ly yesterday when they read of the gor
geously painted, ambitious scheme of M.
F. Tarpey. John E. Bennett and a few of
their friends to build steamships, erect
tanneries. establish warehouses , and
transplant 1.000,000 coolies to the western
shore of Mexico. The incorporation of
the Pacific Charter Company with its pa
per capitalization of $12,500,000. an account
of which was published exclusively yes
terday in The Call, was the first public
knowledge of the affair.
Private McDonald, clerk of Company A
Eighteenth Infantry, has disappeared
with $220 Intrusted to his care by dis
charged soldiers. The police have been
notU.ed.
OnÂ«- hundred and thirty-five men are trÂ»
bÂ« turned over to the newly organ zed
provisional battalion from the casual
camp.
Scigeant Henderson's duties have been
of cuch a nature that all the provisions
used in the casual camp passed through
his hands. The custom in the care of
any surplus has been to return the pro
visions to the grocers, crediting the
amount realized by such return to the va
rious company funds. This, it Is claimed,
Henderson has not done, but has appro
rriateo the money to his personal use.
Lieutenant Winans, lately assigned to
coiMiiand of a company of casuals, de
tected a teamster leaving the camp with
a icaJ of canned goods Tuesday night
afttr retreat. He ordered the goods re
turned and summoned Sergeant Hender
son. As a result of the conference the
commissary was ordered confined to hu
tent. Some time during the night he left
h!a quarters and has not been seen since.
Henderson has held the position of act
lug commissary sergeant for almost two
yeaib and has made for himself during
that time an enviable reputation aj a good
Eoldiet and competent clerk. He is con
nected with several well-known families
In this city and has a host of friends in
civil life. To what amount Henderson is
ir.dÂ«bted to the different funds is not
known. His books show no traces of any
crooked transactions. If the assertions
ma&c by his officers are true, a sentence
of ten years' confinement awaits him in
case of his capture.
Captain John H. Peshine has relieved
Ce plain Hardin of the command of the
First Provisional Battalion.
Fourteen bodies were buried yesterday
In the National Cemetery. There are still
remaining in the Presidio Morgue nnra
thai 500 bodies, awaiting interment or
shipment to relatives.
Acting Commissary Sergeant Egbert
French Henderson, one of the most pop
ular non-commissioned officers at the Pre
fcldio. has disappeared, and his description
has been sent to the police of the bay
cr unties for the purpose of causing his
arrest-
Bailey was approached by a comrade
early yesterday morning and asked to
care for a revolver which was handed to
him, together with a handful of cart
ridges. Bailey took the gun and ammuni
tion. Informing the owner that he wouia
store it in his grip. Instead of doing so,
he walked to one side, inserted a cart
ridge and turning the pistol on himself
puijed the trigger. The bullet entered
about an Inch and a half below the heart
and will probably prove fataJ. He now
occupies a cot in the Post Hospital.
Bailey arrived at the Presidio on Janu
ary 16. with a number of other recruits,
from Indianapolis, where he enlisted Jan
uary 4. His comrades say that he evi
dently missed the comforts of home life,
us since his arrival at the casual camp
he appeared morose and discontented. His
descriptive list shows that his occupation
before entering the army was that of
cierk; that he was in perfect health, and
was known to possess a good character.
TUÂ« name of his nearest relative was
given as Mrs. Mary Bailey, living in In
dianapolis.
Clarence \v\ Bailey, a young recruit,
made a determined and probably success
ful attempt to end his life at the Pre
sidio yesterday by shooting himself
through the body â¢with a revolver. Bailey
Is a "rookie" of less than a month's mili
tary experience, but that brief period In
the ranks was evidently sufficient to dis
gust him with the "trade" of soldiering
and with continued existence on this
earth.

"This concession which the Pacific Char

things %re completed and ready for run

A Million for Chinese Subscribers.
"The holder of each six shares of
your stock will then have J175 worth of
stock, for which he Till have paid $3).
Of this stock, which he will have, six
shares will be your company's stock and
one share will be Pacific Charter Com
pany stock. He will also be entitled to
employment in your company, for thero
will be a large number of employes need
ed in your business. The jobs should 08
given to members of the company. The
man who subscribes for the largest num
ber of shares should receive the best po
eltlon with the largest salary and bo on
down to the small shareholders.
"When the steamships are ready to start
running you will proceed to levy an as
sessment upon the 30,000 shares of your
stock of $4 per share. The 10,000 shares
given to the Pacific Charter Company la
not to be assessed. This $4 per share as
sessment will bring you, with the $5000 you
have. $125,000. That will be ample money
tor you to start business with.
"The first year one steamship will be
put on, and after that new steamships will
be put on as rapidly as the business in
creases to call for them.
"Five dollars out of every six of this
money la to be paid to the Pacific Charter
Company, and for this sum the Pacific
Charter Company will Issue to the sub
scriber of every six shares of your stock
one share of its stock until 5000 shares of
the Pacific Charter Company stock is sub
scribed. When the full 30,000 shares of
your stock is subscribed the Pacific Char-Â«
ter Ccmpany will have 25.000 and your
company will have 5000. In this condition,
the matter Â¦will remain until Messrs. Tar
pey and Bennett go to Mexico, finish clos
ing up the matter there and attend to get
ting the steamships ready and start them
running.
Organizing; & Chinese Feeder.
"In order to put these propositions into
operation we propose as follows:
"That you select a committee from
among yourselves, who will organize a
companv for you; that this company will
have a stock of $1,000,000, divided into
40,000 shares, at $25 per share; that of this
stock 10,000 shares will be given to the
Pacific Charter Company. The 30,000
shares remaining to the company shall be
cold as follows: One dollar cash on each
share taken.
That part of the Chinese circular which
deals with these affairs is given in full
translation as follows:
The circular printed In Chinese and ad
dressed to the Chinese merchants and
fishing bosses of San Francisco Is one of
the most highly entertaining documents
which has appeared recently In this city.
In exchange for the advantages which the
Pacific Charter Company promises to give
to the merchants certain Important de
mands are made, such as the organization
of a Chinese corporation with a capital
Ftcck of one million dollars and the sub
scription of great blocks of stock in the
Pacific Charter Company. This Chinese
corporation is to be simply a tail to the
Pacific Charter Company and its merchant
members are to become high salaried of
ficers.

Only a truly great and effective remedy
could continue, aa Paine's celery com-
pound has done, to hold Its unrivaled
place in the estimation of the ablest phy-
sicians and of the thousands of busy men
and women whose only means of Judging
Is from the actual results In their own
home or among their friends. No remedy
was ever so highly recommended, because
none ever accomplished so much.
It makes people well. It Is the one true
specific recognized and" prescribed to-day
by eminent practitioners for diseases aris-
ing from a debilitated nervous system.
Professor Phelps gave to his profession a
positive cure for sleeplessness, wasting
strength, dyspepsia, biliousness, liver
complaint, neuralgia, rheumatism, all
nervous diseases and kidney troubles. For
all such complaints Paine's celery com-
pound has succeeded again and again
where- everything else has failed.
It Is as harmless as lt Is good, and it
was the universal advice of the medical
profession that the compound be placed
where the general public could secure it.
and thousands of people have year after
year proven the wisdom of this good ad-
vice. '
responding gain In weight and srood, spirits
follow the use of Paine's celery compound.
Paine's celery compound is the most re-
markable medical achievement of the last
fifty years.
His unusual talent soon brought him
reputation and prominence. First he was
elected to the professorship of anatomy
and surgery In the Vermont University.
Next he was appointed lecturer on ma-
teria medlca and medical botany In Dart-
mouth College. The next year he was
choeen professor of the chair then va-
cated by Professor Robby, and occupied
the chair, the most important one In the
country, at the time when he first formu-
lated his most remarkable prescription.
To-day Paine's celery compound stands
without an equal for feeding exhausted
nerves and building up the strength of
the body. It cures radically and perma-
nently. The nervous prostration and gen-
eral debility from which thousands of wo-
men suffer so long that It finally gets to
be a second nature with themâ all this
suffering and despondency can be very
soon removed by properly feeding the-
nerves and replacing the unhealthy blood
by a fresher, more highly vitalized fluid.
A healthy Increase in appetite and a cor-
Professor Phelps was born in Connecti-
cut, and graduated from the military
school at Norwich, Vt. He studied medi-
cine with Professor Nathan Smith of New
Haven. Conn., and graduated in medicine
at Yale.
The story of the lifework of this great
physician has been often told, and is fa-
miliar to most readers.
The aged and infirm found in it new and
lasting strength. Thousands of women
and men, tired out, run down, despondent.
When a great public demand arose for
this remedy from one end of the country
to another, at once, as in every such case, a
lot ot cheap fellows began to try to Impose
upon people one and another trade medi-
cine, sometimes harmful, always worth-
less, claiming for them the unexampled
properties of Paine's celery compound.
Naturally, none of them ever succeeded.
None of them ever will.
Paine's celery compound made people
well !
No sooner was it announced that a posi-
tive cure for nervous ailments, an unfail-
ing blood purifier, had been discovered by
Professor Phelps of Dartmouth, and phy-
slcians everywhere welcomed Paine's cel-
ery compound as the most-to-be-desired
discovery of a time when modern ways
of working and living had begun to mul-
tiply diseases that arise from Impaired
nerves and impure blood-
When the greatest of modern physicians,
after years of practice and close, scientific
study, gave to the science of medicine the
most wonderful remedy of the present
day, a. host of imitators sprung up.
And the foolish fellows with their silly
nostrums, starting up here' and there ev-
ery year, discovered as often as. they tried
it that, when a person's health is at stake,
he or she will not be imposed upon.
Paine's celery compound was In greater
demand last year than the year before;
the demand this spring is greater than
for all the so-called spring remedies com-
bined. People Insist upon having the ona
remedy that does them good, makes them
strong, repairs their shattered strength.
They call for Paine's celery compound!
From thousands of grateful persons un-
solicited testimonials â¢ began to pour in
from those whom Paine's celery com-
pound had benefited. The wealthy and
the poor, the famous and the compara-
tively unknown, sent to the proprietors
of the remedy, to the newspapers, to their
physicians, to their friends, the glad news
that here at last they had found a remedy
that made them themselves again!
sick, suffering with insomnia, rheuma-
tism, diseases of the kidneys, regained
their health, and strength, and buoyancy
by the well-ad visea use of Paine's celery
compound. As a great leader and writer
In Boston publicly declared one day,
Paine's celery compound had proven itself
to be as much better than all the ordi-
nary ' nervines, sarsaparillaa and trade
preparations as the diamond is brighter
than ordinary glass.

After Years of Study and Application, This Greatest of All Remedies
Was Given to Mankind by the Ablest of Modern Physiciansâ
The Host of Worthless Imitators That Followed It.Srr.ator Wolfe ha? introduced a bill at
Farramrnto known as Senate bill No. 137
in Â»rteclare corporations, companies, asso
r'-.-tionf and individuals selling or plac-
Ing debentures, bonds or certificates of
Itn ectment in the State of California to
be investment companies, and placing
Each corporations, companies, associations
and individuals under thÂ» pupervision of
I State Bank Oommippionc rs. The In-
FUr&noe Commissioner and the Building
and Loan Commissioners of the State re
cently signed a joint report declaring, in
M^ist.-uice, that the debenture companies,
as they are commonly known, are practi
cally lotteries. A copy of thi? report was
ycui to Attorney General Ford, who has
f-iree notifiM the several companies of
this sort doing business In California to
ar.pwer by the 2'<th fnst. why he should
not proceed against them to restrain them
fmm doing business in this State. Among
the men interested in debenture compa
nies here are General R. H. Warfleld.
General S. W. Backus, Surveyor General
Gleaves, 1. J. Truman and his sons, ilr.
Gifting, Dr. Bardue and Henry N.
Clement.
Â¦U'hile matters have been coming to a
focus in California the National Govern
ment has also be^n interesting itself in
t.he debenture companies. After a care
ful consideration of the several plans
upon which the companies are proceeding
tie Postoffice Department has sent out
notice that after a reasonable time, which
is allowed that the companies may amend
thfcS;- plans, they will not be permitted to
use the United States mails for the trans
action of business unless their methods
are revised.
In view of the known facts that State
Assistant Attorney General Harrison J.
Barrett of the United States gave hi*
opinion this caption: "Opinion addressed
to the Postmaster General as to the use
of the mails in the promotion of certain
so-called bond Investment schemes." The
opinion occupies more than 100 pages ut
printed matter, In which are analyses of
many schemes. In the conclusion are the
following words: . . .
"I can say that all these schemes as
now framed are in the nature of lotteries
or similar schemes and are based upon
erroneous calculations and blunders from
which the public, which will suffer and be
defrauded, should be protected: and the
promoters of these companies will be
much better off if they are stopped now
and compelled to put their enterprises on
a sound basis before the inevitable co!
lapse comes. The attention of companies
promoting schemes like those herein out
lined should be called to this opinion and,
for the reasons heretofore stated, be given
a reasonable opportunity to abandon the
pame or to make such changes as will
eliminate all objectionable features bo
fore further action is taken by this de
partment in the direction of depriving
them of the, use of the malls."
The department has adopted the course
suggested by %hÂ« Asuistant Attorney Gen
eral of the United States. In the mean
time Senator Wolfe, at Sacramento, is
trying to intrench the debenture com
panies In California,
"I have not said anything about this
matter," said Mr. Bricker. "but as you
have the facts I do not see that it will
do any harm to say what has happened.
The Postofflce Department took measures
to secure literature from all the debenture
companies In all parts of the United
States. Acting under instructions I sent
on the literature of the several companies
here. Some of the California companies
have been notified by the department that
unless they modify their plans they will
be refused admittance to the mails. The
department is not inclined to act harshly
and has not set any fixed time for closing
the malls to them, the idea evidently be
ing to give the companies time to change
their plans to meet the views of the de
partment. It has been found that there
are different conditions under which men
Investing their money similarly may get
returns from the companies. This the de
partment understands to be the essential
characteristic of a lottery enterprise; The
department has also come to the con
clusion that certain of these schemes can
not be financed to a conclusion in such
manner as to protect all investors and
that eventually the liabilities will be so
great that the companies will not be able
to get enough new business to keep them-
Eelves afloat."
"I have looked ever Wolfe's proposed
law. If these are investment companies
the provisions that he proposes do not
give any security to policy holders or in
vestors. I understand that there are more
companies in the course of organization.
They are frauds of the worst description."
Postofflce Inspector L. H. Bricker con
firmed the statements of Mr. Clunie con
cerning the attitude of the Postofflce De
partment toward the debenture com
panies. ' .
"Yes," continued Commissioner Clu
nie, "1 am surprised that any one in the
California Legislature should attempt to
validate such schemrs as the debenture
companies embody, in view of the findings
of the Postal Department and the action
of the Building and Loan Commissioners
and the Insurance Commissioner of this
State. This seems to me to be the place
to shut tnem out. It will be remembered
that the last session of the Legislature
put through a measure similar to the
one now proposed by Senator Wolfe, but
Governor Gage did not sign it. That bill
also provided for placing the debenture
companies under the jurisdiction of the
Bank Commissioners. Now, the constitu
tion of the State of California forbids the
State Legislature authorizing the exist
ence of lotteries. The Penal Code, in sec
tion 325, provides for forfeiture to the
State of funds of lottery companies. I
am waiting for the Attorney General of
this State to take action against the com
panies now in existence.
"It is a fraud." said the Commission or,
"and you can quote me as saying so. The
companies doing business in latiunma
have been carefully investigated. The
Building and Loan Commissioners Bat
with me in all cases. We found them to
he all frauds, and we sent a report to
Attorney General Ford and requested him
to take action against them. They are
lotteries. Since we made that report
the Assistant Attorney General of the
United States, Harrison J. Barrett, has
rendered an opinion to the Postofflce De
partment in which he finds the same facts
concerning debenture companies, and the
department, as a consequence, is prepar
ing- to shut them out of the mails. The
Assistant Attorney General of the United
States had the opinion of David Parks
Fackler, the great actuary, to sustain him
in his interpretation of the plans of the
companies as set forth in their literature.

nies' methods* to be objectionable. Insur

PROTECTION FOR LOTTERIES
The reasons why men do not generally
attend church were discussed last night
at the Church of St. John the Evangelist
by the Right Rev. William Ford Nichols
and Rev. Dr. Clampett. The openlryj- lec
ture was delivered by Dr. Clampett, who
said that the indifference of men to God
was the curse of the age. "I think it safe
to say," said he, "that not* 10 per cent of
our men attend services on the Sabbath.
I further think that not 25 per cent of tne
students of either Stanford University or
the University of California devote any
time to the study of religion. Religion, I
am sorry to say, is the last thought of
the great majority of men," Speaking of
the reasons why men do not attend church
Dr. Clampett said that in a great meas
ure the ministers of the gospel were to
blame.
Bishop Nichols Indorsed the utterances
of Dr. Clampett and furtlfer spoke of the
indifference of young men to matters re
lating to religion.
"On the way here to-night," said he, "I
boarded . a^street car that was crowded
with men on their way to the prizefight.
All ..that I could hear around me was
talk of knockout blows and bets on the
outcome . of the - fight. Nothing was
further . from ; the minds of these
men than God and the teachings of his
church. You ask; why they were going
to the light? Just' to be entertained.
There was an attraction :for them there.
If the sermons of f the clergy were made
more Interesting and better music were
rendered in our churches men would find
more entertainment in them, and the -at
tendance would be Increased." â¢ ,
k In conclusion Bishop ' Nichols exhorted
his hearers to interest themselves among
their . friends and endeavor -to < get them
to accompany them to church.

IS CTJBSE OF THE AGE
Preaching from the pulpit of the Tem
ple Emanu-El last night, Rabbi Voorsan
ger placed before his hearers in vigorous
words his theory of the causes of the con
flict existing from earliest times between
religion and science. From the century
which ha3 passed the preacher drew a
picture of promise for that to come, and
declared that the pessimists who claim
that the present ape has not profited from
the lessons of centuries gone by are
croakers of charges which cannot be sus
tained.
In speaking of educational advantages,
which are one of the fruits of the expe
rience of former centuries, Dr. Voorsan
ger raised his hands above his head and
in a dramatic manner cried: "Alas and
alas, that it should be so; to the same
extent that a nation alienates Itself from
religious enthusiasm to that extent does
the percentage of educated and thinking
persons Increase."
In the character of the scholar, Adam
Warner, drawn by Lytton Jn the "Last of
the Barons." Dr. Voorsanger found a
type of the scientific reformer, as opposed
to the dogmatic ecclesiastic delineated Â±Â»y
the dissipated friar in the same novel.
Continuing, he said:
"They are the two opposites. Popular
superstition against knowledge. Sir Ed
ward Bulwer Lytton has put into the
mouths of his characters the sentiments
which may characterize the difference be
tween the rude age of the period chosen
for the novel and of that which has im
mediately preceded us. We must learn a
little better to distinguish and appreciate
the difference between, those days and our
own. The croaking charge that we have
not profited by the lessons of those days
cannot for a moment be sustained. The
latest structure Is the best, because It
typifies and embodies all previous expe
rience.
"Alas and alas, that it should be so; to
the same extent that a nation alienates
itself from religious enthusiasm to that
extent does the percentage of educated
and thinking persons increase.
"The centuries gone before have not
been wasted. They have produced more
truth in one century than in all the'eeven
teen preceding, and more power to apply
these truths than ever before existed, but
which will increase with the volume of
the years."
Rabbi Jacob Nleto addressed a large
congregation at the Temple Sherlth Israel
last night on the outlook for the new cen
tury. JHe 8i>oke of the pains taken to
delve into the meaning of the Bible, and
declared that the modern religious move
ment tended toward the formation of a
universal religion of t the spirit which
should have as its first duty the abolish
ment of warfare. He said in part:
"Without the heloa furnished by the
commentators, explorers and translators,
it would be Impossible for any one to take
up intelligently the study of Bible litera
ture.
"I. believe that the religions of the world
as they developed from polytheistic to
monotheistic basal principles, in like man
ner are still tending upward and onward
to one great universal religion which will
link all the people of the earth together.
Changes are going on on all Bides. This
leveling down and piling up means that
some day we are to stand side by side
on one religious platform, the first fruit
of the union to be the abolition of blood
shed, the rendering of war . but a dark
memory of ages that have long since
rolled away." Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-.Â¦

NEW CENTURY'S
GREAT PROMISE
it in for me and are trying to make mo
out a guilty man."
Prison Director Fitzgerald ! said iasÂ»t
evening that there was nothing new in
the case. He claimed that immediate ac
tion would be taken against Levy for buy
ing stolen State property. He said that
the matter would be fully laid before the
Attorney General for his advice. Fitzger
ald also claims that he wants Levy to ex
plain the sale of the 15,000 sacks that took
place in 1S9S. Bookkeeper Wadham also
camo in for a scoring.
"If Wadham had attended to his busi
ness," said Fitzgerald, "this thing could
not possibly have happened. Wadham
appeared at our last quarterly meeting
and reported that everything in the books
was O. K. He certainly could not have
been attending to his business in the light
of recent developments. / >v,.,'
"Walden has not been heard from. :No
trace of him can be found. No active
steps have been made to catch him, but
we would very much like to get hold of
him Just at present."
A visit to the offices of Miller & Lux yes
terday established the fact that Walden
had not imposed on that firm by trying to
sell them stolen sacks. John J. Dillon,
the buyer for the firm, stated that he had
only seen Walden once in his life. On that
occasion the former clerk of the jute mill
called at the office of the firm on Califor
nia street. Dillon' explained that all the
business done with San Quentin in con
nection with the purchase of sacks was
done by mail.
Prison Director Wilkins was also seen
last evening at his residence In San Ra
fael. He claims there will be some new
developments shortly and that with a
thorough investigation the true state of
affairs will soon be known. He is also
certain that Walden practiced a sys
tematic course of stealing for several
years. He is anxiously awaiting the re
sult of the experts' Investigation at the
prison and he says that should there be
any more peculations discovered they will
not be made public until the persons who
bought the stolen property have been lo
cated and the goods Identified.
Former Clerk Said to Have Sold 15,000 Saeks in 1898.
Levy Suspected of Being Purchaser and His Books
Will Be Examinedâ Embezzler's Accounts Disappear
Reaches Man's Allotted Three Score Years
and Ten â Prominent in Trade on
This Coast for Fifty Years.
It now. appears that when C. J. Walden.
the embezzling clerk of the jute mill at
San Quentin Prison, so mysteriously dis
appeared he either hid, destroyed or took
his books away with him. This statement
was made yesterday by a guard at the
prison, who rpfu^od to allow, his name to
bo used. The Prison Directors, conse
quently will be badly handicapped in their
efforts to discover the exact amount of
the missing man's peculations?, and the
only way they will be able to learn def
nitely will be to take account of stock.
That San Quentin Prison was systemat
ically robbed by Walden for several years
there can be no doubt. It is claimed that
ex-Governor Budd when in office recom
mended mat Walden be removed, but in
fluence was brought to bear, and though
he was under suspicion he was allowed
to retain his position.
Joseph Levy, the junk dealer, who ad
mits having bought the 50,000 sacks from
Walden, was to have had another inter
view with Prison Director Fitzgerald yes
terday in Captain Seymour's office in the
Hall of Justice. The worry and strain
of the past two days proved too much
for the old man, however, and he sent his
regrets at not being able to be present
Fitzgerald is suspicious that Levy has
been doing business with Walden for sev
eral years, and yesterday, acting under
orders from the Prison Director, Book
Expert Mcl^aren went to Levy's place of
business to examine his accounts with
reference to a sale of 15,000 sacks that
took place in October of 1898. Levy was at
his home, and McLaren was unable to ob
tain the desired Information in regard to
this sale. What the investigation con
cerning this third sale, which was only
learned of yesterday may develop is hard
to surmise. That the suspicions of the
Directors have been further excited by
the discovery of this transaction is shown
JOSEPH FREDERICKS,
A PIONEER MERCHANT,
PA55ES AWAY QUIETLY
by the actions of McLaren. He claimed
yesterday that he was not allowed to
make any statements to the press, but
intimated that when he was through with
Levy's books It would be good time spent
to call in at Director Fitzgerald's office
and read his report. -
Luman Wadham, the bookkeeping: ex
pert of San Quentin, who makes regular
trips to the prison to expert the booKi of
the institution, is likely to encounter a
tropical interview when he next meets
Prison Director Fitzperald. Wadhara's
head is almost certain to fall in the basket
at the next meeting of the board. Fitz
gerald said yesterday that Wadham to a
certain extent was responsible for the
robbery of the sacks. At the last quar
terly meeting of the Prison Directors
Wadham was present and reported that
he had gone over all the books and found
them correct in every detail. Fitzgerald
says that Wadham could not have done
his work conscientiously or he would have
detected the peculations.
The Prison Directors are at last aroused
to the fact that the present scandal is lia
fcle to increase until it assumes gigantic
proportions. A force of expert bookkeep
ers is still employed at the prison, and
Walden's work with the remaining books
will be gone over year by year. In this
city also the matter will be probed to the
bottom. Yesterday afternoon Captain of
Detectives Seymour and Prison Director
Fitzgerald had a long consultation. What
the nature of the conference was Captain
Seymour refused to state, but it is sur
mised that detectives are scouring the
water front and the warehouses of sack
dealers to ascertain if there are still more
bales of sacks which have been purchased
from Walden In this city.
Joseph Levy was seen last evening at
hie residence, 1445 McAllister street. He
spoke freely of his dealings with Walden
and apparently desired to keep nothing
back.
"I do not remember ever buying 15,000
sacks off Walden in the year of 1898. Of
course I might have done so and when I
get down to my store I will look the mat
ter up. These Prison Directors have got

am so weak at my stomach, and have indigestion terribly, and

" There is a weight in the lower part of my bowels, bearing
down all the time, with pains in my groins and thighs â I
can't sleep, walk, or sit, and blue â oh goodness ! I am simply

This is a most vivid description of a woman suffering with
nervous prostration, caused by inflammation or some other
diseased condition of the womb.
No woman should allow herself to reach such a perfection
of misery when there is no need of it. Read about Miss
Williamson's case and how she was. cured.

THE STOCK MARKET.
For the first time since election there has
b*Â«n a reaction In the stock market. The
movement has been attended by a decrease
of activity in the Stock Exchange and -the
public Interest In speculation has materially
decreased. The money market. It may be noted,
though showing no particular change In rates,
had a tendency to become easier, as funds are
flowing to New York on a very large scale
and further heavy accumulations In the banks
will, it is expected, be seen between the pres
ent time and early spring. The money mar
ket has shown- almost complete indifference
to the shipment of Jl.600,000 gold to Paris, the
fieling being that the loss of from J10,000,000
to J16,000.000 gold would, under the present cir
cumstances. Involve no change -In the ease of
meney In the New York market. So far as
railroad properties are concerned the Increases
In earnings are keeping up and further favor
able developments are looked for, i In spite of
the fact that, according to all appearances,
the street was greatly misled by the antici
pations of a deal Involving a change In the
control of St. Paul and its lease to the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific. Expectations
of the Immediate return of the dividends - on
Erie first preferred have also been negatived
9r.d there has also been a decrease of the con
fidence regarding the Immediate effects of the
new development in the coal road situation on
the earnings of dividends of the Reading Com
pany. For this reason a good deal of specu-'
Istlve selling by. disappointed holders has oc
curred in the Reading and Erie Issues, as well
an in St. Paul and the Pacific stocks, the de
cline In these securities carrying down the.
general list with it. At the same time it Is
generally admitted that the market has be
come* rather extended, a great many securl-'
ties being held on weak margins, thereby ren
dering a liquidation of such stocks Inevitable.
Certain large speculators are credited . with,
having taken a, bearish position and there has
undoubtedly been a good deal of short Â¦: sell
ing. The large banking Â¦ and other Interests
Identified with railroad properties . have not
licen sellers to any extent, but they have not,
except In a fev Instances, shown much in
clination to protect their properties in . the
face of renewed disposition of the public . to
lio.uldate. TheÂ» downward movement failed In
force as the week progressed, although It may
hÂ» raid that th< street as a whole is not in
clined to consider that the bull market Is over
1 or to look on the current demonstrations as
I more than a temporary reaction.
NEW YORK. Jan. 18.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
NEW YORK, Jan. li.â The market waÂ» sub
jected to an energetic shaking down to-day
which caused a notable decline in prices.
Prices, however, had been practically well ad
vanced before the decline set in and there
were notable recoveries at the end. The net
changes, therefore, do not by any means give
a just idea, of the character of the market.
The fall in prices was in moet cases a per
penClcuiar one from the high to the low level,
which gave It the appearance of great violence.
The bulling -which caused it had all the ap
pearance of great urgency and was in very
heavy volume, large blocks coming out on the
decline. It should not escape notice, however,
that there were important stocks In the list
which offered good resistance to the prevailing
weakness and which rallied well from the de
cline. The tone of the steel stocks was much
tetter than yesterday. .They were vigorously
supported, especially Federal Steel, and there
v. :.- a good demand Irom the short interest.
Important members of the group show small
net gal^s on the day. There were points of
strength as well in the railroad list. Missouri
Pacific. Southern Pacific and Union Pacific
were well absorbed during the day and Balti
more and Ohio showed no further sign of yes
terday's extreme weakness. Eug&r manifested
etreagth and closed at the beBt, at a net gala
cf nearly 2 points, but it was a noticeable
fact that the early advance In prices was
Â¦omewhat laboriously achieved. The determined
effort to support tÂ£e market, which was man
ifested at tie opening, necessitated the ac
cepianoe of some very heavy offerings before
the weakness was overcome. When the move
ment of prices was once, turned upward it
eeeriied to have the effect of checking epecu
l&tive liquidation and the volume of dealings
wan r&ther email on the upward course, but
it proved an easy task for the bears to undo
the work of the bulls when they commenced to
offer prices down. The severest sufferers on
the decline were the New York public utilities,
grangers, the ooalers and, later In the day.
Northern Pacific. Bt. Paul's extreme decline
wan over 4 points and Northern Paclflo suf
}ered to the extent of 3^. Consolidated Oas
and Delaware and Hudaon were forced down
nearly 5 points, Lackaw&nna 3%. Tin Plate
preferred. Steel Hoop common and preferred
and Colorado Fuel 1 to t%, the local tractions
from 2% to 3H. the grangers 2 to S. Erie first
preferred 3, aad a large number of the prin
cipal active etocks from 1 to 2 points. The
activity of the market declined as the rise
progressed and there was no evidence of any
tot! ve renewal of a demand for stocks. The
dosing vu wavering and at the best only In
a few cases. The forecast of the bank state
xnest bad an Influence in driving the bears to
cover with the prediction of an Increase of
nearly 110,000,000 In the cash resources. In
eplte ot the payment to the sub-treamiry of
the gold withdrawn from the assay offlce for
export the week's eub- treasury operations has
yielded to the banks the sum of J3.743.000. On
the Interior movement by express the banks
are estimated to have gained considerably over
$5,000,000. The week's liquidation on the Stock
Exchange points to the probability also of a
loan contraction. Sterling exchange advanced
again to-day and the expectation Is general
that a furtbÂ«r gold shipment will go out next

There was heavy selling at Chicago, and it
was believed to be for account of the Wall
street longs. Counselman & Day, Keene's
brokers, sold considerable, some said as high
as 600,000 bushels. It was also eald that Ar
mour was selling, but he openly bought May.
At any rate, somebody was giving the crowd
all It could I take without unduly forcing the
market. This selling .was done on the hard
spots, while the Northwest bought freely ou
the breaks. The Argentine was again
reported bullish, and one large buyer took
1.000,000 bushels on an Antwerp cable sayln^
that the River Platte surplus for export would
not be over 46,000,000 bushels. The Argentine
I shipments for the week were 648.000 bushels,
against 781,000 last week and 633,000 for the

NEW YORK, Jan. IS.â Monty on call steadj
Failures for the week .were 325 in the United
States against 242 last year, and 43 in Canada
against 40 last year.
Steadiness Is the chief characteristic of the
Iron and steel Industry. The past week has
broughtÂ»,jio new developments and prices are
unchanged. There Is a notable lack of new
contracts covering large operations, but many
small orders are placed and mills are well oc
cupied on old business that in most cases will
take ma-ithn to complete. On this account
there Is no urgency about securing orders.
Work Is bo vigorously prosecuted at the fur
naces that demand for fuel increases and coke
production in the Connellsville region expands.
Coal also moves more freely at Plttsburg.
There is still some uncertainty regarding tha
proposed tube and sheet , plants, and action by
the Carnegie Company is awaited with Interest.
Another moderate increase occurred In sales
of wool at the three chief Eastern markets,
raising the total for three weeks to 10,3S2,300
pounds. There ls-Btlll a heavy loss compared
with preceding years. Manufacturers' stocks
are generally considered low. Nevertheless
they buy only for Immediate needs and con
tinue to take mainly the cheaper grades. Re
sults at the London auction sales were more
satisfactory than anticipated, buyers compet
ing vigorously for the offerings, which were
quite as heavy as expected. . Prices were from
6 to 7% per cent better than the previous sale.
The raw material for the other leading textile
Industry has been in less satisfactory position,
owing to depression in the yarn market, which
caused the association to recommend reduction
in the output by a half. Large estimates of
the cotton crop also assisted the decline.
In most directions" the condition of general
business has Improved slightly this j week.
Prices of staple commodities are steady, as are
most manufactured goods. Orders to manufac
turers are sustained in volume, and that pro
nounced easy \ money in the interior is still
stimulating business Is shown by bank ex
changes at leading cities outside of New York
for the week 14.2 per cent larger than in 1900
and 17.8 per cent above 1899. At New York the
record is a gain of 77.3 per cent over 1900 and
S7.3 per cent over 1899. Retail trade has not
declined as much as usual since the holidays.
Textiles " show more life. â¢ â¢

NEW YORK. Jan. 18.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were idle and depressed to
day on a rumor that the Queen's health, is
very bad, suggesting a possibility of a gen
eral election and the reopening of the Trans
vaal question. These apprehensions seemed
far fetched, as was talk of an eaxly new war
loan. â¢
Americans were heavy early and hardened
on good buying orders of Southern Pacifies,
but reacted on the New York opening, closing
dull. The bask lost Â£40,000 gold to Roumanla.

Wheat, including flour, shipments < for the

bushels last week, 3,061 000 bushels in the cor
responding week -of 1900 and 5.19S.671 bushels

exports were 107,362.905 bushels, against 113,-
S13.S01 bushels last season and 139,234,719 bush
els in 1S9S-99.
and an advance of nearly one-third is reported
in window â¢ glass. Lumber appears to have
been active at the West and wholesalers have
done - more at the East, < but the export trade
lags in this line, as In others.
-The. textile situation is not altogether, clear.
Cotton has weakened on Increased stocks at
the South. Wool Is in slack demand and man
ufacturers buy only to coveri orders. The shoe
trade Is In good shape so far as spring order*
are concerned, and leather is firm. â¢
It has been a week of ebbing strength In the
cereals. Argentine reports display an India
rubber consistency,-, and this week has been
devoted to stretching estimates of the export,
surplus from that country. Northwest wheat
receipts have also been heavy, and the so
called Wall street interest has been reported
to have been liquidating. Flour Is dull, but
the decline of 10 to 20 cents per barrel has
tended to help export business.,
WJU", or rathir rumors of war, have been
the chief subject of discussion in the Iron and
steel trade this week, and to some extent have
exerted a depressing effect on sentiment. New
demand at this . time, however, is never very
large, and conditions as a whole are healthy
and even promising. The labor outlook In iron
does not promise as well. The announcement
of the bessemer producers that they will re
duce wages 25 per cent has been met on tho
part of the men by a demand for a 10 per
cent increase. Â¦Â¦:Â¦ " . â¢ I

tons. The deliveries this week have been about
equivalent to the quantity consumed, so that
the stocks yarded will remain generally undis
turbed. The call for steam coals teema to
have enlarged the !ast few days, and may lead
to a reduction of the amount on hand, beforo
the end of the month. The strikes simulta
neously of the mines at the Gallup and Pleas
ant Valley collieries will probably force the
Southern Pacific Company and Santa Fe Com
pany to enter the market here as fuel pur
chasers, as they were drawing freely from,
the above sources last year. Coal freights
from the North are softening somewhat, and
vessels are more numerous. The last reports
from Australia show a weakening of freight
ratÂ«=. but coal Is almost unprocurable, and
local values have advanced at Newcastle so
that th* delivery cost here will preclude ship
ments for the present. Almost all the car
goes of Australian now en route were sold
months ago, and but few names are being add
ed to the loading list. Fuel oil for future de
livery id not being so generously offered, al
though new wells are being started almost
daily. Consumers in a cumber of cases art

will not permit me to relate to you the good
that the association has done for San Fran

tures of California In the - Mechanics" Pavil

duce In California better products and manu-
I aoture better goods than in any part of the
world.
President Sbarboro then dwelt upon the
question of adulterated foods and the ef
forts of the association to remedy the evil.
Both the State and Federal governments
were pledged to pass bills to enforce the

gether, but It would be\hard to tell which
one would get up with ihe other inside of
him. Passing from a jocund vein to a
serious one Mr. Platt complimented Presi
dent Hays and lauded the work of tho
Southern Pacific road. A tribute was paid
by Mr. Platt to the late C. P. Huntington,
and his associates, who had carried an
enormous burden to a ripe old age. In
closing Mr. Platt created a hearty laugh
by saying: "111 fares the land where com
merce accumulates and lawyers decay."
Percy T. Morgan replied to the ( toast of
"The Viticultural Industry of California*
and James H. Barrv spoke on "Capital
and Labor."
The last toast was "The Press," uo
which General W. H. L. Barnes replied.
General Barnes dwelt upon the great
work accomplished by the press and said
that all development in human knowledge
was for the benefit of the press In spread-
Ing enlightenment. It was a blessed hour
for the world when Guttenburg discovered
movable type. The reader of a news
paper did not realize tho enormous under
taking represented in a dally paper. The
capacity of the press vas" beyond compar
ison and the gentlemen who dwelt in high
places according to Mayor Phelan were
often abused. It would be a time of glad
ness when the weapon of libel would fall
and Justice should reign in the office of
every newspaper. It was a matter of
great satisfaction that the press had
spoken well of President Hays, who had
evidently brought about the dawn of the
millennium.

At the close of the address of President
Hays the guests rose and Joined In the re
frain. "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow."
Irving, M. Scott was then called upon to
soeak on . the subject of "The Manufac
turing Interests of the State..'
Mr. scott dwelt upon the remarkable
development of California and what^ had
been achieved In every direction in forty
years. The ship-building industry â¢ had
flourished - and Is now reaching for the
championship of the world. The time Is
surely coming when the Pacific Ocean will

â¢W H.y- Mills responded to the toast,
"The Producers of California." He quoted
figures to show the remarkable develop
ment in the various Industries. The peo
ple of California had - great difficulties Â¦ to
contend ' with In the way of con
ditions and want, of - labor. They had
surmounted these problems and had made
the land flourish. California will reach
the highest development ever; reached by
a country 7 in the history of : the world.
There .is but one- America and, but one
California and: with 'the help' of . God the
prosperity >' the r State 'now 'enjoys will
continue In dignity, and peace. -
This gathering to-night Is a good omen. We
ought to come together more frequently. We
should understand each other. It would be
better If we all went out to the Band hills and
buried our hammers and hatchets. Wo must
on theso occasions commend ourselves, for
other* will not do so. In fifty years we have
progressed from the stage of slow development
to that of great enterprise. Our people an1
our products have attained eminence abroad.
We have nothing to apologize for in welcom
ing our guests to San Francisco, not even our
charter. Our honored guest, Â¦ President Hays,
has come herÂ© to find business and to care for
It. Merchants should welcome him and all
friction should be set aside. - He has come
here to serve the Interests of the community
with which his road does business. The State
cannot progress without - the railroad or the
railroad without the State. We are beginning
a new era, for the interests of the railroad
are those of the. State. In the. name of* San
Francisco I welcome you, Mr. Hays.
The Introduction of President Hays of
the Southern Pacific by Â¦ President Sbar
boro evoked applause which lasted fully
three minutes. With the return of silence
President Hays said:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: If California
needed any indorsement that It was a good
place to live in. I have found it here to-night.
This great gathering Is In honor of your pros.
perlty. I am glad to claim San Kruntlsco as
my future home and am delighted to be with
you to-night. Frequent meetings of this kind
are good for all Â¦ who take part In them. X
pledge myself and - the staff of the railroad
to attend all the banquets we possibly can.
I have been asked to speak on the functions
of the raHroad. That is a big task and my
remarks will bo brief. Whatever the lawyers
may say as to the functions of a railroad, the
public always decides that question. From a
railroad standpoint the function of a railroad
Is to serve the public in the best manner pos
sible consistent with Its duty: to its stockhold
ers. AÂ« ' far as the . company I represent- Is
concerned, that will always be Its policy. Our
lrtereetn are allied to yours. Wo cannot quar
rel, without hurting each other. We will do
all in our power to assist you In developing
the resources of your wonderful State. The
beacon which shall guide us will be California,
the Pacific Coast and San Francisco, â¢ and we
will so tell the whole world.' There arÂ» many
nays In which a railroad can assist a com
munity. Our road may not have pursued this
policy always. It may have been actuated by
selfleh motives sometimes. An association such
as ' youra Is one > In which the \ railroad must
have Â«very faith and sympathy. Tour, inter
ests and ours are clossly woven together. WÂ«
will help you develop,' jour Interests and. you
will help us to develop ours. Gentlemen, I
thank you for your attention.
Mayor Phelan, In responding to the
toast, said that San FYancisco was proud
of the' association, which was the result
of a century Â«f civilization. . He often
wondered why people flocked to San Fran
cisco, for not long ago it was an obscure
city on the edge of the continent. Re
cently Eastern papers had stated that San
Francisco had been destroyed by a storm,
and In Its obituary notice had said that
the city possessed a few good buildings.
No mention had. been made of tho superb
system of. street railroads or the many
gas and electric works in existence. Noth
ing had been- said of the great City Hall,
with its towering dome, the highest in the
land. Not even a reference had been made
to the new charter or the new president
of the Southern Pacific road, all of which
were parts of San *Tanclsco's greatness.
Continuing, the Mayor said:
Sbarboro then read a congratulatory tele
gram which had been sent to President
McKinley in which the association looked
forward with pleasure to welcoming the
nation's chief executive to California.
President Sbarboro then dwelt upon the
fact that at the previous banquets many
distinguished persons had been present as
guests of honor, and that on the present
occasion the association had the pleasure
of welcoming the new president of the
Southern Pacilic Railroad and others
equally distinguished. Loud cheers fol
lowed the mention of th'e name of the rail
road president. President Sbarboro then
called upon Mayor Phelan to address the
gathering and proposed the toast of "Wel
come to Our Guests From San Francisco."
The Civil Service Commission yesterday
tried the case of J. F. Lajianey, an eligible
food inspector, against whom charges
were filed by the Health Board. The
names of Lahaney. Daniel Reardon and
O. S. Mlsh have been certified for ap
pointment as food inspector, but neither
of them is acceptable to the board, which
desires to appoint J. T. Silvera, who is
next on the eligible list. If Lahaney is
excluded from the list Silvera's appoint
ment will be made pos3!ble. The board al
leges that Lahaney was once a food in
spector and was dismissed for filing false
reports. Health Officer O'Brien, Chief San
itary Inspector Chalmers, Dr. Hassler
and Dr. Buckley, members of the Health
Board, testified to that effect. ! C. W
Gould. J. Tracy and M. J. Cunningham
were also placed on the witness stand,
but no evidence was adduced *hat Laha
ney had maliciously falsified the report.
The commission therefore declined to take
Lahaney from the eligible list.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
appointed Henry Farauharson from the
civil service eligible list to be clerk In tha
Bureau of Streets. Farquharson succeeds
M. K. Cummings, who failed to pass high
enough in the examination to be certified
for one of the eight clerkships. Cum
mings. however, was retained aa an office
assistant and this was resrarded an an
evasion of the civil service by the Civil
Service Commission, which directed the
board to make the necessary requisition
for the vacant clerkship, which resulted
in Cummings' resignation.

would fight any man of his size and

General Dick exhibited a good deal of
forbearance, but finally gave up his ques

For the first time during thÂ» Investi

day Superior Judge N. H. Conklin â¢ disa
greed with Judge Trask of Los Angeles
in his Interpretation of that section of the
State -law providing that members of
county Boards of Education are entitled
to a compensation of $3 per diem while in
session. Judge Trask held that the sec
tion of the law was unconstitutional, but
Judge Conklin sustained its validity. The
issue came before Judge Conklin on a
mandamus action brought by Mrs. Vlolet
ta Campbell, a member of the San Diego
County Board of Education, to compel the
Auditor to draw a warrant for $50 in her
favor for services rendered, at the rate of
$5 per day.
In finding for plaintiff In this action
Judge Conklin based his decision upon
the fact that the Legislature had author
ized the existence of county Boards of
Education, had provided for the manner
of election of members to constitute such
boards and had also provided the compen
sation to be paid for the services of mem
bers while in session. The same duties
were required of all members of county
Boards of Education throughout the'
State, and therefore the provision of the
law that each member shall be paid $5 per
day while in session did not come under
the ban of class legislation.
The compensation, in the opinion of
Judge Conklin, was a reasonable one.
There had been no question raised that
the services had not been fully performed,
and in his Judgment the ruling of the
court should be In accordance with Jus
tice.

He managed to Crawl about on the floor
of the little house a little, but was unable
to get at any of the staples that he had
so carefully stored away for his use dur
ing the long rainy months of winter.
For four days the old man lay in this
condition, making futile efforts to reach
something that would sustain life. When
Mr. Fowler, a neighbor, found him he was
on the floor near the door of the cabin
and almost dead. He told Fowler some
of his struggles during the four days that
he had tried to reach his stores of
food, and he asked Fowler to get word to
LIvermore asking some of hi3 old hunting
companions to reach him before death
came. It was too late to do anything that
would save his life. Fowler ministered to
a few of his wants, making him as com
fortable as possible, and then left to send
a message to Livermore. Arthur Fiedler,
the County Treasurer of Alameda County,
who received the message, and a large
party of other friends of the old man Im
mediately responded, but he was dead
when they arrived.
A coffin was taken up yesterday,- and
"Uncle" Ralph ,was buried on his own
hillside ranch.
When the party arrived at "Uncle"
Ralph's cabin they found that the old man
had actually starved to death with food
all about him. By his side was a little
diary that told of the early part of his
starvation. He had just managed to
keep this faint and almost illegible record
of his sufferings and that was all.
The old man was stricken with paralysis
while in his cabin. His mind was evi
dently unimpaired, but the use of his
limbs was entirely gone. He was com
pletely helpless, and though there was
plenty to eat on the shelves of his little
home he was unable to reach anything.
He had laid in his winter supply of food,
and there was enough to last him until
summer, but it was all out of his reach.
"Uncle" Kalph lived entirely alone. In
summer he was frequently visited by
hunters, but in winter the old man spent
weeks at a time without a caller. His
nearest neighbor was four miles away,
and visits lor mere sociability were few.
This is the information brought back by
those who went to the Ittle mountain
cabin to see that their old friend of many
hunting trips was given a civilized burial.

Deputy Marshal Grant Johnson has
brought the news that the disaffected
Creek Indians, know as the "Snake
band," are up in arms and raiding tho
country, Winchesters In hand, whipping
and maltreating peaceful Indians. John
son ran across a band of fifty, headed by
John Creek, yesterday, near Proctor.
They were armed to the teeth and were
arresting some Creeks 6f this part of the
country, whom they took to Hickoiy
Grouna, their headquarters."Hnd whipped.
These people. It Is said on good author
ity, have killed one man who resisted ar
rest. The Marshal says the country west
of here is in an uproar, that several bands
of disaffected Indians, numbering about
fifty each, are out and are claiming to be
the legally constituted authority In the
nation. They have elected an independent
chief council and other officers, and the
Peaceful people have applied to the United
tates authorities for protection.
These Indians are all full-blooded. Ig
norant and stubborn. They are the anti
treaty party, and say they will make no
treaty and will not allow any Creek coun
cil to ratify one. Soldiers may be neces
sary to put them down, and there Is
widespread alarm here as to what they
will do next. ,. - ;

PALT LAKE. Utah. Jan. 1Â«.-The four
r-.-.y se^lon of the National Livestock
Convention closed at 4 o'clock this after
noon. Chicago was selected as the place
for holding the next convention, the dale
to be fixed b>- the executive committee.
The first order of business, being the
election of the place for the r.ext con
vention, brought out the full delegation,
and the hall was well filled when Presi
dent Springer called the convention to or
k^evcral resolutions were acted upon at
<Ki- opening, one being a resolution that
forest reservts be limited to actual tim
ber lands.
Considerable time was consumed in
caiilr.p and correcting the membership
roll. The regular order of business 'was
then taken up.
Mr. Gavin cf New Mexico made a strong
speech In favor of Chicago, and F. E.
s-'ardburn eet forth the advantages of
Omaha as the next meeting-place.
After several seconding speeches a
roiicall was ordered. At the close of the
ca'.l it was apparent that Chicago was
far in the lead, and ex-Senator Carey of
Wyoming moved that the selection of Chi
<agx>.be made unanimous, and there wai
r. '. a dissenting voice.
At the afternoon session a resolution
was passed asking the Federal Govern
ment to discover some remedy fop- vege
table poison! r.g.

They next bored the front door. They
succeeded in breaking the lock, but the
padlock, placed; as a precautionary meas
ure higher up and .which, was '. not visible
from the street, baffled them. They then
smashed one of the panes of glass In the
transom and climbed Into the saloon. One
of them must have" cut himself in getting
through the broken' transom, for the side
wall" Is stained with blood. Whether he
was cut while getting in or by a piece of
the safe when It was blown open Is a mat
ter of conjecture. :â¢. 'Â¦ /
The safe Is located at the end Â¦ of the
bar, just behind/ the lunch counter. The
cracksmen first wrenched the knob off
the safe door and then applied giant pow
der. A heavy charge must have ' been
used, for. people living a block from the

GRAND JURY ASKS
GINTY QUESTIONS
Chief Deputy Assessor's
Card System Is a Flat
Failure.
The Grand Jury held a brief session yes
terday afternoon, and at its conclusion
the committee on Assessor, Recorder and
Treasurer, consisting of \V. E. . Lutz
(chairman), J. Platshek and J. Elliott,
proceeded to the Assessor's office on \ a
visit of inspection. Here an investigation
was at once commenced of the expensive
"card system" Introduced in the office by
Chief Deputy â¢ Assessor Glnty. The sys
tem cost $1800. and consists of an elaborate
filing cabinet and 70,000 cards, the money
for which was appropriated by the Board
of Supervisors.' The cards are used to
record the descriptions of pieces of prop
erty, together with the names of the own
ers. They. were to.be filed in alphabet
ical order, and transcriptions were to have
been made from them to the assessment
books.
Glnty was kept busy explaining to the
Grand Jury committee the - reason why
the expensive apparatus has so far proved
a dismal failure. -Heretofore the assess
ment books have been directly, compiled
from the block maps. ; Time and labor are
saved in this way, but CJinty evolved ' a
plan to write up the books from the cards,
which increased the expense of preparing
the assessment roll and was abandoned
after Its impracticability waa ascertained.
The names of the owners of property
keep changing dally and these changes are
recorded. The same is true of mortgages,
releases, deeds and other Instruments, and
! the card system would not work. After
the clerks had put in all their. spare. time
in the day and often late Into the night
changing the names on the cards it was
found necessary to go back to the old
plan of transcribing from the block maps.
Considerable time and money have conse
quently been wasted in an attempt to in
troduce a new scheme which is a flat
failure.
Ginty believes that his card system will
work like a charm next year, as -he in
tends to begin operations on it earlier.
He so Informed the committee, which will
report the result- of its Investigation at
the next session of the Grand Jury.

police headquarters and the same advice
was given to the complainants. The ad
vice was to provide the doors with heavy
padlocks and staples to keep the burglars
out.
The news of the attempted burglaries
reached the ears of P. Christensen and
F. Sharpe. proprietors of the St. Law
rence Cafe at 417 Post street. They. In
vested in a heavy padlock and placed It
on the inside of the door, about three feet
above the regular lock. Christensen
closed up the saloon at 2 o'clock yester
day morning and, acordlng to the stories
told by neighbors, who are not watch
men, he had not been gone more than half j
an hour when the safe was blown open.
The cracksmen first tried to force open
the side door used by Christensen when
he was going home. A dozen marks of
the "Jimmy" axÂ© plainly noticeable around
the jamb.
The unusual spectacle of an old woman,
apparently dying, being carried into a
courtroom on a stretcher . was witnessed
at the Hall of Justice yesterday after
noon. She was Mrs. Bridget Degnan, who
is nearly 80 years of age.
She had " a legacy of several hundred
dollars bequeathed .to. her some months
ago, and while on a visit to Mrs. Annie
Burger, her married daughter, who lives
at 512 Fourth street, she became 111 and
was confined to her' bed for two months.
Both her mental and physical condition
were weak, and her son, Thomas P. Deg
nan. wanted her removed to St. Mary's
Hospital, where she would have proper
care and attention, pending her final re
moval to the Old People's Home.
Mrs. Burger refused to allow her to be
removed from her home, and the son ap
plied for and obtained from Judge Troutt
on January 3 letters of guardianship on
person and estate. Mrs. Burger still
refused 'to allow her to be taken from
her house, and the son applied for a writ
of habeas corpus and the case was as
signed to Judge- La wlor's court. Dr. The
odore Rethers was appointed by the court
to examine Mrs. Degnan and report as to
her condition. He reported that she
should be removed immediately to St.
Mary's or some other hospital.
Two Deputy Sheriffs went with the writ
to the Burger residence yesterday after
noon with an ambulance, and against the
protests of Mrs. Burger and her family
Mrs. Degnan was lifted from her bed,
placed on a stretcher and driven to the
Hall of Justice. She was carried upstairs
to the third floor, but as Judge La wlor
was hearing the Huntlngton murder trial
she was carried into Judge Cook's court
room. -Dr. Leland. who. was watching the
Huntington trial, was asked by the Judge
to examine Mrs. Degnan. and he reported
that she should be removed to a hospital
at once, otherwise she might expire in
the courtroom. The. Judge adjourned
court for a few minutes and at once or
dered Mrs.- Degnan sent to St. Mary s
Hospital. The argument on the writ-was
set for this morning at 10 o'clock. The
Judge later announced from the bench
that the order for Mrs. Degnan's removal
to the. hospital would not Prejudice the

to oomplain. They think it strange that
threÂ« attempts and one successful
burglary ehould be committed within a
week on Post street, between Grant ave
nue and Mason etreet.
The police never heard of any of thesa
crimes until the victims reported the facts
H the Hall of Justice. The district in
fested is patrolledâ or at least Is supposed
to be patrolled â by special policemen. In
addition to members of the reg
lax force. That makes the mat
ter more strange. Up to date the
burglars have not been able to arouse any
of the watchmen. When they blew open
the safe In the St. Lawrence Cafe they
made a noise sufficient to wake up people
living a block distant. The policeman on
thÂ« beat did not hear it. nor did the
watchman employed In the buildings ad-
Joining the saloon. It remained for one
of the proprietors of the cafe to discover
that his saXe had been wrecked and that
the burglars had carried off between $400
and $500 In coin and about $200 worth of j
Jewelry to pay them for their night's
work.
The burglars commenced operations on
Post street las: Saturday night, selecting
the jewelry Ftore of Lundberg & Lee, at
222 Post street, for their first venture.
They drilled three holes over the lock on
the front door and attempted to break it,
but failed. Had they succeeded in forcing
the lock they would have still been on the
outside, for there is a snap lock higher up
on the door that can only be reached from
the inside. Taking it for granted that
the attempted burglary would be reported,
but that the police would follow the. old
adage that lightning never strikes twice In
the same place, the burglars returned to
work in the same neighborhood the fol
lowing night.
They selected "The ABahi," at 224 Post
street, expecting, at least, to be rewarded
with silks, curios and art goods If the safe
resisted their efforts. They succeeded in
getting the lock out of working order.
Finding that they were wasting too much
time and fearing that by some mischance
a policeman or watchman might happen
along, they withdrew for refreshments.
When they resumed workjja few hours
later they made an attack on the "Orien
tal Variety Bazaar," at 126 Post street.

A Coroner's jury, after hearing the tes
timony presented yesterday at the inquest
on the remains of William TrewheLa,
who was shot at the Windsor Hotel last
Monday afternoon,by hâ partner. Robert
E. Glaze, broughtin a verdict that Trew
hella " came to : his death by gunshot
wounds inflicted by Glaze, and further
charged Glaze .with the crime of murder, j
The accused man after consultation with
his attorneys decided not to be present at 1
the inquest. Justice of the Peace Daniels
conducted the, investigation. Coroner Le
land, who takes office this morning, being
a witness, having performed the autopsy
on Trewhella's body. Assistant District
Attorney Weller appeared for 'the police
department,' and Glaze was represented
by . Attorneys I. I. Brown and W. W.
Foote. The Jury consisted of W. A.
Swlnerton, Fred Shaw,* Abe Haas, S.
Steinberg, John Rogers, A., Lux, C. P.
Richardson, William Smith. J. C. Berend
son. "William O. Leaxy and A. M. Blade.
The first witness called was John H."
O'Connor, bellboy at the Windsor Hotel,
and he repeated the statements he had
already made to the police. O'Connor told
how he. had gone down to the kitchen of
the hotel to secure some limes for the
bar. and there mWt Trewhella. After a
joking . conversation with Trewhella the
hotel man started to leave the kitchen to
go to the storeroom, accompanied by the
witness. , :
"As we were going down the three steps
leading from the kitchen," said O'Connor,
"I heard a ahot and saw Glaze standing a
few feet away with a pistol In his hand.
A second shot was fired by Glaze, and
Mr. Trewhella sank to the floor. I was so
scared that I do not remember how many
shots were fired. I tried to lift Trewhella
up, but could not do so, as he was a very
heavy man. Glaze by this time had gone
around by another door and came up be
hind me and "said, 'If any one asks you
who shot this man you say that he shot
himself.' Glaze then walked across the
court to the hotel office and I followed
him. I saw him give his pistol to Albert
Shelley, the day clerk', and throw a num
ber of cartridges on the floor. Then the
police and a lot of people came Into the
notel."
Attorney Foote put a number of ques
tions to the witness, but failed to shake
his testimony. Assistant LÂ»istrict Attor
ney Weller in asking that the line of ques
tioning : should not be allowed made a
slight error by sayin" "the defendant has
already answered the question.'' This slip
brought a hearty laugh from Attorney
Foote, who was rebuked by a juror, who
sharply said: "This is no matter for
hilarity." Attorney Foote subsided when
he learned that the speaker was one of
the' jury. Â¦".
Hippsley Justain. salesman for H. S.
Skinner & Co., 416 Market street, dealers
In arms and ammunition, then took the
witness stand. He testified that last Mon
day about;! p.' m. Glaze, whom he knew,
came into the store and asked to. have a
revolver cleaned. The witness cleaned It
and also fired the weapon in the store
basement to see if it worked properly.
Glaze bought a box of cartridges. The
witness was handed the weapon used by
Glaze and recognized it as the one he had
cleaned on Monday.
Albeit Shelley, clerk at the Windsor
Hotel and stepson of Glaze, wasjthe next
witness. He testified that on' Monday
morning at 8:15 he was on duty in the
hotel office. Trewhella came to him and
asked him .what cash was on hand. "I
showed Trewhella the cash book," contin
ued Shelley, "and Trewhella after looking
at it said, 'I will clear this crowd out."
At 1 p. m. I saw Trewhella go back from
the ofllce to the kitchen, and shortly after
Glaze went in the same direction. I did
not see the shooting. I heard shots flred
and ran back to the open court In the
middle of the hotel. Glaze walked past
me into the hotel and O'Connor was be
hind him. I followed Glaze, and he gave
me his pistol and threw some Â¦ cartridges
on the ... floor. When I saw Trewhella
after I heard the shots fired he was half
reclining on the steps of the kitchen. I
heard four shots fired. I recognize the
pistol as the one Glaze gave to me and
which I handed to the police." Â» '
Attorney , , Footeâ From the position
where- O'Connor was when you saw him
and the spot where Trewhella -was reclin
ing could O'Connor have seen' the shots
fired?
Witnessâ No, he could not have seen
them fired.
Assistant District Attorney Wellerâ Tou
only heard the shots fired and arrived on
the spot after the shooting.
Witnessâ Yes, that is so."
Â¦.Attorney Weller â That is all I want to
know.
Police Officer N. J. Barry testified that
he was on duty at the corner of Eddy and
Market streets last Monday afternoon
when Olaze came up to him. "He told me
that he had taken two shots at a man in
the Windsor," said the officer, "and I
thought at first that he meant that he had
punched a man. Then he said the man
was badly wounded and 1 I realized what
he- meant. Glaze was very cool, but a
man with, him was excited. I took Glaze
over to the hotel. He did not want to go
inside, .'but I took him in. I. saw, that
Trewhella j was badly wounded and tele
phoned for an ambulance. 1 received a
pistol and cartridges from Albert Shelley
arid then- 1 took Glaze to the City Hall; I
did not handcuff Glaze, and we went out
on the'ear. Glaze jumped on the car as
It slowed up at the crossing."
Alfred Jaggi. 907 Market street, testified
that- on Monday afternoon last he heard
the. sound of firing and looked out of his
window. He saw Glaze in the inner court
of the Windsor Hotel. He was coming
out of the kitchen and was ejecting
cartridges from a revolver which he had
in his hand. "Witness . also saw. Glaze re
loading the revolver as he walked to the
hotel office." He heanl four or five shots
fired in rapid succession.
Edward McCormick; druggist at 812
O'Farrell street, testified that he arrived
at* the "Windsor. Hotel about 2 p. m. last
Monday. He was asked to get a doctor
and telephoned for one. He found Trew
hella reclining on the steps of the kitchen
Trewhella's head and shoulders were on
the steps. He saw that Trewhella was
alive and asked some one to help him to
lay him down on the floor. "Witness, cut
