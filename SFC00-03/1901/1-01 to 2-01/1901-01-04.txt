It is 6aid, for the purpose of prolonging

Accompanied by one or two officers he

towered over the tiny commander In chief,
making him appear smaller than ever, al
most overweighted by the Immense
plumes of- his field marshal's hat.

The War Office, the West End clubs and
the public buildings were illuminated this '
evening. The thoroughfares are unusu

evident, but there was little Â©f the dis
order and drunkenness of the previous
war celebration. ; i
All the royal ladies- were In half-mourn
ing ?.nd most of the guests in neutral or
somber tints, very few appearing In
bright shades. Five tables were beauti
ful with gold plate and flower decorations. â¢
At the high table, in the center Lord Rob
erts, looking fatigued but triumphant, sat
between the Princes3 of Wales and thÂ«
Princess Victoria of Wales. The Prince
of Wales sat between Lady Roberts and
the Duchess of Argyll. At the same table
sat the Duchess of York, the Duke of
Connaught. the Duke of Cambridge, Lord
Salisbury. Lord Wolseley and Lord Sel

Duk? of York, Included Mr. and Mrs.
Chamberlalnl
There were only two toastsâ one to the
Queon and the other to Lord Roberts. The
Prince of Wales, proposing the health of
the field marshal, said:
"It Is my pleasure, in behalf of the
Princess and all of the members of the
royal family and In the Queen's name, to
welcome Lord Roberts home from the dis
tant country where he has I commanded
our gallant army In very difficult and try-
Ing circumstances. I am glad to think
the war is now approaching a, conclu

the great success he has achieved and
upon seeing him safely back. In the name
of all present I wish to express our de
light at finding Lord Roberts accompanied
ty his wife and two daughters, especially
the one whose health recently caused so
much anxiety."
After felicitating Lord Roberts npon the'
reception accorded him by the citizens
and the soldiers the Prince went on to
say:
"It was such a reception as was ex
tended to all Englishmen who do their
duty. His Lordship and I have known
each other eo long that it fills my heart
with Joy to see the gallant soldier homo
again. None could offer him heartier con- â¢
gratulatlons than those who, in behalf of
the assembled company, it Is my privilege
to extend to him proposing his good
health." -:
The speech of the Prince was frequently'
interrupted with cries of "Hear, hear."
and the whole company arose to honor,
the toast. Lord Roberts, replying-, said in
part:
"My heart Is full of Joy at the unex
pected and magnificent honor with which
her Majesty the Queen has been gra
[ clouBly pleased to reward my endeavors "
in South Africa and at the splendid wel'- â¢
come the public of England has given me.
"The only drawback to my happiness Is.'
that circumstances In South Africa have
prevented more of my comrades from be
ing with us, the comrades to whose valor
and military skill I owe any success that
may have been achieved lri South Africa.
I much wished that some of the repre

accompanied me here. the. colonies which
have given their bravest and their best to !

REPORT OF FIGHTING IN
DISTURBED CAPE COLONY
After congratulations had been ex
changed Lord Roberts walked with the
Prince of Wales, the Duke of York and
the. adjutant general. Sir Evelyn Wood,
and reviewed the guard of honor. The
veteran field marshal, who appeared to bo
in perfect health, with pink cheeks, bore
himself jauntily and with evident enjoy
ment. He walked down each rank, salut
ing with his left hand, as his right hand
is still in a sling as a result of his fall
from his horse in South Africa, speaking
to the sergeants and occasionally picking
out a private for a few words, recalling
previous service together.
After the Inspection Lord -Roberts had
a few -minutes' conversation with his old
comrades before he went out into the sta
tion inclosure to meet London's multi
tudes.
The Prince of Wales, with Lady Rob
erts, left the railroad station in a royal
carriage drawn by six horses and escorted
by Life Guards, preceding Lord Roberts
to Buckingham Palace. The returning
field marshal was then presented with an
address from the municipality of Pad
dlngton. After Lord Roberts had replied
the procession was formed, the headquar
ters staff In six carriages following Im
mediately behind the field marshal, who
occupied a state carriage, escorted by In
dian cavalry.
The Secretary of State for War, Wil
liam St. John Broderick, and the Secre
tary of State for Foreign Affairs, the
Marquis of Lansdowne, were seated In an
other carriage. A detachment of cavalry
brought up the rear.
The party proceeded to Buckingham
Palace by way of Hyde Park and Picca
dilly. Deafening cheers greeted the field
marshal and new commander In chief of
the forces along the route. Clubland was
ablaze with color and the greatest enthu
siasm prevailed. The ladles admitted to
the clubhouses thronged the windows and
balconies. The hotels and other buildings
were all lavishly bedecked and wero
crowded from top to bottom with cheering
spectators.
The roar of welcome rolled on Increas
ingly until the veteran commander en
tered the gates of the palace. A few dis
tinguished people were waiting wearily
within the somber quadrangle, in which
the gaslamps vainly tried to disperse the
foggy gloom. The Foot Guards on duty,
wearing their overcoats, were drawn up
within, while without some 50,000 persons
were packed together In an effort to get
a view of the hero of , the hour.
The royal party arrived a half-hour be^
fore Lord Roberts,, who was- driven Into
the quadrangle amid a salvo of cheering
from the crowds and a dignified waving
of handkerchiefs on the part of the bare
headed nobility.

to points of vantage along the
route to De followed by Lord
Roberts from Paddlngton Station
to Buckingham Palace during
the eirly hours of the morning, but the
numbers In no way compared with those
that Gathered at the demonstration In
honor of the return of the City Volunteers
from South Africa. Fears of the riotous
behavior and disasters on that occasion
deterred many persona from Joining In
the public welcome. Warned "by the oc
currences at the time of the volunteers 1
return, the authorities to-day furnished
barriers to prevent crushing, and 13,000
regular troops In addition to thousands of
police lined the route,- blocked the side
streets and were concentrated In the wide
spaces to puard against dangerous rushes.
Lord Roberts reached Paddington Sta
tion only twenty minutes behind ' the
schedule time. As he descended from his
saloon carriage to the platform of the
elaborately decorated railroad station he
was greeted by the Prince of Wales, the
Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess
of York, the Duke of Connaught and the
Duke of Cambridge. The members of the
royal, family shook hands heartily with
the flÂ«-ld marshal, while the bands played
the national airs. The Princess of Wales
engaged Lord Roberts in a conversation
of some length.
The scene was altogether brilliant
Everywhere were masses of bunting,
troops, ladles in bright costumes, Cabinet
Ministers and staff officers.
The people on the stand opposite the
carpeted platform- could see little but
cocked hats and ladies' bonnets. The

ANDERSON'S friends are commencing to arrive InSan Francisco from all parts of the State, and as they come his
strength grows. His friends still say his election is assured, and they have figures to prove their contention.
They say they have absolutely thirty Assemblymen; they are willing to concede to Pendleton twenty-two. In ad
dition to these that are certain one way or. the other there are seven more Republicans, none of whom have yet
expressed a choice. Their friends say Anderson will have a majority of the seven anyway, and perhaps all.
.i,ven allowing that Anderson should get none of the' seven who so far have remained neutral, he would still have a
Dare majority In caucus, and; with the men they are sure they will get from the non-committal ones Anderson's friends

Senate Committee on Military Affairs
Willing That He Should Â¦Be-,"'- 1 /
tire as Major General. .
WASHIXOTOX, Jan. 3.â The Senate
Committee on Military Affairs to-day
agreed to accept the amendment susÂ£e.Â»t
ed by Senator Daniel to the army reor
ganization bill for the retirement of Gen
eral Fltzhugh Lee and General James H.
Wilson as brigadier generals, and also
agreed to an amendment for thÂ» retire
ment of General Shafter as a. major gen
eral.
cusslon were A. Ruef, R. P. Troy, T. Carl
Spelling, A. B. Truman, Thomas B. Cur
ran, Samuel Braunhart and Charles
Glldea.
Opposition was developed to the fea
ture of the measure drafted by A. Ruef
by which the party test is applied by the
filing at the general election of a declara
tion of Intention as to party affiliation.
Some of those present objected to the ap
plication of a test so long before the pri
maries. Ruef explained that the purpose
was to draw party lines before campaign
situations should develop which would
cause members of one party to desire to
vote in the other's primary.
T. Carl Spellipg wanted the committee
simply to refer, all the bills which had
been submitted to it to the Elections
Committee of the Legislature, but It was
finally decided to make another attempt
to agree upon one measure, to be reported
to the Legislature with the conference
committee's Indorsement.
pp^ip^HB indorsement of C. W. Pendle
[ ton for . Speaker by Boss Martin
1 1 Kelly's bunch of San Francisco
1L Assemblymen causes rejoicing in
â¢ > - Democratic circles, but creates a
profound sense ot- apprehension among
Republicans who stand for good govern
ment and clean Â¦'politics. Yesterday
friends of Pendleton sought to ex
plain away the ugly- fact that Boss
.Kelly in person attended to the pro
'gramme of Indorsement and became the
central figure of congratulations in the
Grand Hotel bar after the Indorsement.
It may enlighten the representatives
frcm the interior counties to know that
Kelly firmly asserted his rights as a boss
and compelled the Indorsed candidate and
the Assemblymen who/ gave the Indorse
ment to openly acknowledge the power
of the boss machine. â¢~KelljÂ£ never" .'moved
a step forward to extend the'-hand of boss
fellowship. He compelled all .-of. the ap-;
plauding bunch and the Los Angeles can- '
didate for Speaker to march to the front
and center and properly salute thÂ© organ
izer and leader of the Pendleton forces.
Assemblymen Fisk. Tread well. Knight
and Macbeth did pose as purists in poli
tics. Perhaps they formerly belonged to
the guild of Phelan-worshiping Republi
cans. Those San Francisco Assemblymen
did not appear to be shocked at the spec
tacle of Martin Kelly receiving the hom
age of Candidate Pendleton. They know
ingly took Boss Martin ICelly's pro
gramme from. "Colonel" Martin Brady
and openly accepted the thanks of the
boss for their obedience to his orders.
Later on they saw their candidate pay his
respects to the boss who knifed and de
feated M. M. Estee, the Republican nomi
nee for Governor, and betrayed Horace
Davis, the Republican nominee for Mayor.
"When the Republican Assemblymen rep
resenting the agricultural and raining dis
tricts of the State are in the Republican
caucus at Sacramento the San Franciscp
"nucleus" which Boss Kelly created, they
should call i to mind some of the facts of
the campaign. | It is to be hoped that the
San Francisco delegates wDl be seen in a
bunch. Singly and detached they do not
amount' to much, but bunched they pre
sent as fine a bouquet of statesmen as
the metropolis ever sent to Sacramento.
Boss Kelly -did not pluck these flowers
without assistance. John C; Lynch and
Jere Burke help'ed him in the garden. In
quisitive Assemblymen from the Interior
should- apply to Senator Nelson .of San
Francisco and Senator Belshaw of Contra
Costa and Marin legarding ,the services
vihich Burke and Lynch rendered the Re
publican party in the recent campaign.
Let them ask these Senators if Lynch and
Burke did not diligently work for the elec
tion of a Democrat to represent Senator
Nelson's district and a Democrat to rep
resent Senator Belshaw's district.
It would be well to inquire why Sena
tor Cutter, secretary of the Republican
State Committee, is so anxious that the
Assembly should not choose for its
Speaker the president of the California
League of Republican Clubs. It is not j
considered good form for a Senator to
make himself conspicuous in the organi
zation of the Assembly and it is certainly
out of place for the secretary of the Re
publican 8tate organization to mix in a
contest between Republicans for . the
Speakership. Senator^jCutter admits that
he Is working for Pendleton and that he
has requested that the chairmanship . of
the Committee on Itoads and Highways
be given â¢ to Assemblyman Merrftt. If
Senator Cutter were half as -wise as he
would have the Legislature believe he
.would consult Martin Kelly and not
. "Corney" Pendleton In rega.rd to-chair
manships of Assembly committees. Bops
Kelly has'every reason to know- that the
best committees of the Assembly have
been promised to the San Francisco As
pemblymen who met at the Palace Hotel
and Indorsed Pendleton.
There is hardly a doubt that the "com
bine" of the Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco City delegations to organize the As
sembly was created through shameful
promise* of 'patronage. Many more prom-

Mr. Chamberlain's statement In Parlia
ment. lx-r<3 Kitchener contended, clearly
showed i hat there was no wish to oppress
the burghers. On the contrary, the Brit

*n',isnter.ed povernment. in which the
turghers would have a prominent share,
5nsur:::g the richts of property and the
f.ncier.t laws and customs of the burghers.
Lord Kitchener urged that it was use
less to continue the present inhuman
struggle, pointing out that the powers
lad refused Mr. Kruger's requests for
intervention The burghers, he said had
fought a eood fight, but they had been
overpowered, and there was no dishonor
in the leaders recognizing the fact. He
reminded the committee that there were

of former Governor. Plngrree and the inau
gural message of Governor Bliss.-
Mr. Plcgree prefaced his message with
some extemporaneous remarks, in which
he attacked the courts. Legislature and
press.' He also- urged the Legislature tÂ»
appropriate sufficient money to amply pay
the expenses of the Governor, gayingr It
had cost him $450,000 during his four years'
term. The reading of the message, which
consisted of ninety-five printed pages,
took almost. four hours.
After mentioning thÂ« failure of, the Sen-
Ate to pass the railroad taxation bill, the
fqrmer Governor said:
If the people wish this great problem to be
ratisfactorily tettled they must center their
efforts on the election of a Senate which shall
b<* lew subject to the seductive arguments of
the railroads and other wealthy and powerful
interests and more responsive to the wishes of
the people. â> .
The message urged the Legislature to
adopt a resolution requesting* Congrees to
call a convention for the purpose- of pro
posing an amendment to the constitution
to provide for the election of United
Stales Senators by popular vote. The
message says: .. :â¢Â¦
The cases of Hanr.a in Ohio, Clark In Mon
tana and our own discouraging and disgraceful
experience* furnish the moat powerful and con
vincing argument in behalf of popular elec
tions. It la a matter of common knowledge
that the office is sought by wealthy men, not
to much for the alleged honor as for the op
portunity which it offers for financial protlt
and commercial advantage)*, not only through
stock speculation, but in other and less legiti
mate ways. Intead of being the bulwark of our
Government, as the framers of the consti
tion Intended it, the Senate is now locked upon
with fear and distrust by the people of the
country.
Municipal ownership of public utilities
was advocated.
Discussing the . pardons and paroles
which, have been granted to prisoners dur
ing his term pf office, the former Governor
said: .
The people of the State would bÂ« astonished
if they could know how loose and careless, and
almost criminal, have been the methods â¢ cf
courts and prosecutors in criminal cases. It
has become a trite saying In our State, among
thoee familiar with the circumstances, that
our public prosecutor^ should be named "public

cf the fact that they take an oath of ofSc* to
protect the Innocent from punishment as much
as to bring the criminal to Justice, and to pro

authorized, the statement .to-day that he
Is arranging to pull off a light In this city
between the 25th of May and the 10th of
June for .the championship of the world
He will also give a purse for a fight be
tween Terry McGovern and a man he will
produce at the ringside on the day of bat
tle. McGovern has been considered In
vincible in his class, crawling up from
bantam-weight to lightweight and down
ing all opposition, but Stuart thinks lie
has found a man of his class .who can
take his measure, and If not give Mc-
Govern the greatest battle of his life
The signs point to the big battle as one
between Fitzsimmons and Jeffries, but
Stuart is very guarded in his statements
and as. a great mass of Bo-called Inter
views have gone out he desires to apeak
authoritatively and deliberately in the
matter. The news came by wire from
Chicago yesterday that Fitz and Jeff had
been matched to fight In Carson In May
When asked if this was "by the cards"
Stuart said the news was not a -surprise
to him. "There will be a flght in this citv
under my management next summer, and
It will be a world's championship battle "

Special Dispatch to The. Call.
PACIFIC GROVK, Jan. 3. â The most
prominent figure in to-day's session of the
Pacific Coast Students' Conference was
John R. Mott, general secretary, of. the
World's Student Christian Federation.
Mr. Mott arrived last night and from the
first moment of his presence at the con
ference his powerful personality Im
pressed Itself upon students and leaders
alike. This morning Mr. Mott addressed
the members of the missionary institute
department He also took part In every
exercise.
The platform address, this morning was
open to the public and a' Iar&re audience
was in attendance. E. T. Colton, inter
national college secretary of the Young
Men's Christian Association and chair
man of this convention, presided, and
some excellent music was rendered by the
conference quartet.
Rev. Dr. H. C. Mlnton. president of the
Presbyterian Theological Seminary of San
Anselmo, delivered the first address at
the public session, hSe theme being "The
Authority and Inspiration of the Holy
Scriptures." The question of to-day, said
Dr. Mlnton, is not so much what does
the* Bible say as have we a Bible and is
it authoritative. Then, with clear, logi
cal arguments, he proceeded to solve prob
ably the most difficult as well as one of
the mos\ Important fundamental ques
tions of the Christian religion. The dis
course was rather technical, for the
speaker lost slKht of the (general audience
and talked straight to the trained minds
of the college men, to whom he came to
speak, but It was full of Interest to all
who heard it.
At the close of the public session. John
R. Mott addressed the, students on tho
splendid results of the past decade of
work among college men. Henry J. Mc-
Coy, general secretary of the San Fran
cisco Young Men's Christian Association,
and Dr. Minton addressed the' Life Work
Conference.
The convention held open house In the
museum lecture-room to-night, and a
function such as only a lot of students
could have carrled t out was enjoyed.

Bishop Nlnde was well known on the
Pacific Coast, having served as superin
tendent of the work of his church in Cali
fornia, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
He was born in Cortland.N. Y.. in 1S32, and
was the son of an Episcopalian preach
er. His education was obtained In Wes
leyan University, from which institution
he wns graduated In 1S55. In the follow
ing year he Joined the Black River confer
ence, where he sprved several Important
churches. In ISfil he was transferred to
Cincinnati and was appointed pastor of
Trinity Church. In 1S70 he became a mem
ber of- the Detroit conference and pastor" of
Central Church, Detroit, the leading
charge In that city. In 1873 he waÂ« elected
to the chair of practical theology Mn Gar

His election to the episcopacy took place

Special C^pateh to The Call.
SAN JÂ»3E, Jan. 3.â A number of promi
nent citizens of the southern end of Santa
Clara County are advocating a division of
the eounty and the creating of a new
county with Gilroy as the county seat. It
is said a determined effort will be made
to secure the passage of such a bill at
the coming session of the Legislature.
This matter of forming a new county has
come up annually for some years and its
advocates now believe there is a chance
of it being carried. Henry Miller, the
cattle king, has cherished euch a hope
for years. His home is near Gilroy and
he has large Interests there. For some
time Miller and other cattle and dairy,
men around Gilroy have been possessed
of the idea that they are not getting fair
treatment from the Board of Supervisors
of this county, because of a law passed
compelling the examination and testing
ot milch cows to see if they Â¦were afflicted
with tuberculosis. Miller successfully re
sisted the attempts of Veterinary Spencer
two years ago when the latter attempted
to kill six of his cows that were afflicted
with tuberculosis, and his action resulted
in the ollice being abolished at that time.
Apsemblyman Ell Wright, who left for
Sacramento to-day, stated he had been
informed the people of the southern end
of the county would ask the Legislature
to create a new county. He said he was
not advised, however, as to the details.
There Is an especially rich country
around Gilroy. Las Animas has been
suggested as the name of the new county,
with, Gilroy as the seat of government,
it is said Miller has offered to give the
nites for what county buildings would be
I needed.
Should such a bill be introduced a warm
fiKht would be made against it by the bal
ancf of the county.
ll is eald the division haa progressed so
far that a prominent San Francisco at
torney is drawing up a bill looking to
such an end that will be presented to the
Legislature. The division line will be run
ea*<t and west, just south of Coyote, some
fourteen miles from here. It Is also pro
posed to annex a strip of San Benito
County, which adjoins Santa. Clara. San
Benitoites approached on the matter are
paid to favor the move. The area of the
proposed new county is estimated at 450
to 550 square miles, with a population of
about 5000. The total assessed valuation
of the territory In round numbers is
â¢*S,000,OGO.
With Gilroy as Its Seat.
ETROIT, Jan. 3.â Bishop W. X.
Nlnfle, aged CS years, of the
Methodist Episcopal church, was
_ found dead in bed at his home
here to-day. It is thovight the
cause of death was heart trouble. He at
tended a funeral yesterday and caught a
cold.
Deceased had been a Bishop of the
Methodi5t Episcopal church since 1SS4. He
was at one time a missionary In India. He
leuves a wife, three eons and one daugh
ter.
Yesterday the presiding ciders of Michi
pan held a conference and decided to sell
the episcopal residence here, now occu
pied by Bishop Nind*Â»'s family, because
the churches if Michigan outside of De
troit and other cities had failed to con
tribute sufficient funds to maintain it.

this morning. The Union Hotel. Murphy's
Hotel, five saloons, two butcher shops, a
general merchandiso store, three fruit
stands, three restaurants and a furniture

total loss is estimated at $50,<XÂ». The in

The alarm was sounded at 1:45 a. m. The
f.ames were first observed in an Italian
fruit store In the rear of J. L. Griffin's
Seaside market. In the dry wood of the
fragile buildings the fire gained rapid
headway. Sweeping along Front and
Fifth streets, the entire block was soon
In a blaze.
Citizens turned out and tried as best
they could to <o:;Sn<Â» the conflagration to
the block, and as there was little wind
their efforts proved effective. The flames
attacked the Union Hotel and that of J.
Murphy, both email structures near the
wafer front. These soon succumbed, and
the lire spread to the adjacent restaurants
and saloons, low structures, that served
to intensify the force of the flames.
The Esperanza saloon and that of Mur

from suffocation by turning another

prevented the loss of all the municipal

were stored.

l.OS ANGELES, Jan. 3.â Coroner Hol
land -was notified this morning of the
finding of the headless corpse of a man
near the summit of Mount Lowe, and will
go up to-morrow morning- to make an In
vestigation. T^he man had evidently been
dead for several months, as the corpse
was practically; a skeleton, though fully
dressed. No trace of the skull was found
in the vicinity of the body, and this looks
as though there might be some mystery
back of the affair, as it Is not believed
that wild beasts would have carried off
the head alone and left the rest of the
body undisturbed.
The grewsome llnd was made by some
truf-sts of the hotel while they were ex
plorlnp the mountain on the east side,
from a> quarter to half a mile beyond the
hotel. It was lying in the bushes, and the
discovery was made by the 4 merest acci
dent. Â¦ ' , ,
The clothing of the PkPleton would seem
to indicate that the deceased was a man
in reasonably good circumstances, being
of fair material and well made. The cufl
buttons were in the, cuffs and $1 42 in
money whs found In the pockets. A gold
watch anil chain' wore also found on the
corpse, all of which would indicate that,
in matter what else was the motive, It
was not robbery.
Not a slip of paper or anything else was
found by which the identity of the corpse
could be established.
At the Echo Mountain House no ad
ditional facts could be ascertained. So far
as known no one was missing from the
hotel, and no explanation could be given.
It was at first thought that the corpse
might be that of one of the men who was
engaged in. fighting the mountain fires
several months ago, who .had been over
come and fell down in the brush and died.
Hut as against this theory it was pointed
out that It was highly improbable for the
reason that the skull was missing. This
fact was also urged against the suicide
theory, or the possibility of the unfortun
ate man having wandered away in the
mountains nnd lost his way.
. Hy some It is urged that the head being
missing' Is almost positive proof that a
crime has been committed; that the man
was probably lured into the bushes and
murdered, and the head severed to pre
vent identification; The fact that nothing
was taken disproves the robber theory
and leaves revenge the only motive for
the crime, if one was committed.

OLEOMARGARINE
BILL UNDER FIRE
Defeat.
National Livestock Associa
tion Working ior Its
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â The Senate
Committee on Agriculture t^-day resumed
its hearing on the oleomargarine bill. Hon.
William M. Springer, representing the
National Livestock Association, was the
flrst person heard. He said the associa
tion for which he appeared represented
a combined capital of $600,000,000 and that
it holds annual conventions. He read a
memorial from the association in opposi
tion to the oleomargarine bill as an effort
to build up ond Interest at the expense of
another. He quoted figures to show that
whereas the milk cows of the country are
valued at $514,000,000. the other cattle foot
up an aggregate of $689,000,000 in value.
He said that the opinion of stock raisers
is unanimous that the passage of the
pending bill would mean the destruction
of the oleomargarine Industry and â¢ that
there was little effort on the part of the
promoters of the bill to conceal this pur
pose. Â¦â¢-'
Two gentlemen present, named respec
tively Adams and Knight, interrupted
Judge Springer while he was quoting
from reports of the House to say that
they had been entirely misrepresented by
those reports. Mr. Knight said that a
letter had been printed in the-Congres
sional Record which purported to have
been written by. him,\ which was an abso
lute falsehood. â¢
Mr. Springer was also interrupted by
Governor Hoard of Wisconsin, who re
iterated his charge of attempted bribery
of merchants by oleomargarine manufac-
U Resumlng. Mr. Springer charged thÂ«
friends of the bill with Interfering in poli
tics and he quoted a letter from Mr.
Knight, who is secretary of the National
Dairy Union, with headquarters at Chi
cago, directed to a constituent of Con
gressman .Wadsworth, saying that his re
election, unless by;a greatly reduced ma
pority, would be a "triumph of the stock
yards and oleomargarine frauds." '
Mr. Knight, who was present, said that
Mr. Wadnworth's majority had been re
duced 2000. :
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.â The radical
element among the House Republicans,
who favor cutting down the representa
tion from the Southern States in which
franchise is abridged, suffered defeat to
day because a number of their colleagues
refused to act with them. The Issue was
precipitated quite unexpectedly. The
leaders had decreed that the reapportion
ment bill should be taken up to-day, but
before It could be taken up Olmstead of
Pennsylvania offered as a matter of priv
ilege a resolution reciting the alleged
abridgment of the suffrage in Louisiana.
Mississippi, South Carolna and Xorth
Caroliua and directing the Committee on
Census to investigate and report the facts
to the House in order that a constitu
tional basis of representation could be
established for those States.
The resolution created a sensation. It
was a surprise even to several of the Re
publican leaders. The le-adcrs on the Dem
ocratic side sought in vain to head off
the rc-solutlcr. with points of order, but
the Speaker ruled against them. They be
gan a filibuster, avowing that they would
nght every proposition looking to the re
duction of representation from the South
ern States to the bitter end. Several of
the P.epublicans were secretly In sym
pathy with them, and their indifference
to the fate of the Olmstead resolution in
the end gave the opposition the victory
of to-day. Many of them quietly paired
with absent Democrats, leaving their ab
sent colleagues unpaired. As a result
when the question of consideration was
raised against the resolution it was de
feated, Â£1â S3. 1
The vote was a strict party one. Two
Republicansâ Landis of Indiana and Mann
of Illinoisâ answered present, but did not
vote. The story of the defeat is found
in the absentees on both sides who were
unpaired. Thirty-two Republicans were
cbsent and unpaired, against sixteen of
the opposition. Those absent and un
paired were:
Republicansâ Boutelle of Maine. Bro
sius. Brown. Burkett. Calderhead. Clark
of New Hampshire, Dahle, Samuel Dav
enport, Dick, Fowler. Gardiner of New
Jersey. Hawley. Hoffecker, Ivnox, Lori
mer. Loudenslager. McCleary. Metcalf,
Miller, Mondell. Morgan. Needham, Otlen
Parker, Prince, Russell. Showalter,
Smith of Illinois, Sprague, Stevens,

Bradley of New York, Brewer. Caldwell
Catchir.gs. Gaston. Gayle, Glenn. Levy,
May, Meeklnson, Shepard, Stallings, Wil
son of South Carolina and Zeigler. Silver
Republicanâ Wilson of Idaho.
The situation with reference to the re
apportionment bill is greatly complicated
as a result of the Injection of the Olra
stead resolution. Chairman Hopkins
however, is confident^of victory for his
bill. He thinks the Olmstead resolution
may pass in a full House and investig*
tion may be made, but that the matter
will end there. Irrespective of the fate
of the resolution, however, he will press
the reapportior.ment bill and thinks it
Jill pass on Monday. If possible he will
Â£lsplace private bill day to-morrow with
nis measure.

To Bo Arrested on a Charge
of Smuggling a Bolt
Dr. Holmes, surpeon on board the United
States transport Grant, will meet with a
lively adventure when he returns from
Detroit, whither he has gone on a twelve
days' vacation, if Assistant United States
Attorney Banning keeps his word. Mr.
Banning ' announced yesterday that he
would: prefer a charge of smuggling
against the doctor on his return and would
have him arrested for that offense.
The trouble for the doctor grows out of
the arrest' last Wednesday of Ar Mllthorp.
Dr. Holtms' assistant. Dr. Holmes had
a bolt cf silk th&t he wanted to get ashore
without paying the duty,* and the package
having been stopped by Inspector Enlow,
the doctor sent it on board again and re
quested Mllthorp to smuggle it ashore.
Mllthorp â¢ concealed the : package en his
person and was arrested as he came down
the gangplank. Ho. explained that he was
only obeying tho orders of Dr. Holmes,
his superior officer, as was his duty, and
that If Dr. Holmes had commanded him
to strip *Â¦ and walk down the gangplank
with the roll of silk strapped to his abdo
men he would linve obeyed. Mllthorp was

Chicago is deep in the discussion of the municipal

upon to enforce their rights, and in that case the
United States will have to determine whether or no
it will support Cuba or leave her alone to deal with
the powers as best she can. It is of course well under
stood no considerable number of the American people
would be willing to see Cuba coerced by a European
alliance, and consequently it is argued we are likely
to be involved in difficulties that will in a. measure
force us to something very much like the annexation
of the island. At least we may have to establish a
protectorate, and with that will be established cer
tain internationaLresponsibilities we cannot shirk.
Another authority surmises from the vague reports
given out that the claims refer in part at least to the
so-called '"Cuban debt" contracted by Spain for the
government of the island. That debt was guaranteed
by Spain at the time the money was obtained, but at
the treaty of Paris an effort was made by the Spanish
Commissioners to get the United States to assume thÂ«
debt, or to guarantee that Cuba should assume it.-
As neither/ of those obligations Avas accepted by our
Commissioners, we of course cannot be held to as
sist the claimants in any way to recover what they
believe to be due them.
The supposition that the claims are of that char
acter is strengthened to some extent by a recent state
ment of the Spanish Finance Minister, to the effect
that while the Cuban debt question was not settled by
the treaty, of Paris, and while Spain has neither af
firmed nor denied that the debt went with the island
and is due by Cuba, yet the duty is imposed upon
Spain of /"negotiating, when the opportunity, comes,
with a view that these burdens should ultimately b
laid, as justice demands, on,the resources of the cSeded
territory, which Spain, in the legitimate exercise of
her sovereignty, mortgaged for the payment of the
same."
If the etairrji presented to our Government turn
out to be no more than those of holders of Cuban
debt bonds iswed by the Spanish Government, ths
DUR Government is said to have received in
quiries from subjects of Britain, Germany
, ; /and France concerning certain claims against
Cuba, and, while the nature of them has not been
fully disclosed by the State Department, it is believed
in some quarters they may amount to a serious issue.
It does not appear that thus far the Government of
either France,Â»>Britain or Germany has interfered in
the matter. It is merely a question on the part of
individuals whether or no our Government will exert
its influence to indue* Cuba to pay the claims, or
whether the United States will itself be responsible
In one presentation of the case it is argued that
if Cuba, as an independent state, refuses to deal justly
with the claimants, their Governments will be called
CLAIMS AGfllNST CUB0.
WAR'S capricious fortune was strikingly illus
trated by the fact that on Wednesday the dis
" patches from London announced first that
Field Marshal Roberts had been welcomed by the
Queen with all the honors due to a successful general
in a great war; and, second, that the foe, so far from
being vanquished, has taken the aggressive and is
now actually threatening the British capital in South
Africa. Roberts thus obtains glory and an earldom
for a triumph which has not yet been accomplished,
and Kitchener is struggling in far-off South Africa
to justify the reward received by another.
Some time ago a dispatch from London announced
that Roberts would be received with greater honors
than had been shown to Marlborough or Welling
ton. That of course .was an exaggeration. There is
considerable difference between the earldom and the
moderate fortune conferred on Roberts and the duke
doms and splendid estates granted to the victorious
commanders at Klenheim and Waterloo. Nor, with
the embarrassments of the \\;ar still fretting their
minds, is it at all likely that either the Government
or the people feel much like receiving Roberts with
a genuine enthusiasm. They have welcomed him, of
course, for the people have been glad to ''hail I their
only general who achieved victory in South Africa,
and the Ministry is well pleased to have him at home
to take charge of the army and relieve the War De
partment of further responsibility; but, after all, that
kind of a welcome does not rank in the same clas3
with the tumultuous outbursts that greet a hero who
returns from a victory" which has ended a war and
established peace.
In contrast with the fortune of Roberts, Kitchener
has had hardly anything but misfortune in South
Africa. In no single instance has he attained any
brilliant or notable success. He is left to the dreary
task of pursuing the swift traveling Boers and of
wreaking vengeance here and there by burning farm
houses. His efforts thus far have been futile. The
burning of homesteads has had no other effect than
that of making the people more bitter than ever
against the empire, and his attempts to head off Dewct
have resulted in the capture by the Boers of troop
after troop of his scattered forces.
In the meantime the British taxpayer is doubtless
thinking less of either Roberts. or Kitchener than, of
the increasing taxes the war has entailed. When the
struggle began Parliament in a burst of enthusiasm
voted $50,000,000 to defray the cost of it. . That sum
was soon expended, and up to the time of the disso
lution of the late Parliament more than $346,000,000
had been added to it. A large portion of the expenses
will be paid out of current revenues and war taxes,
but .more than $220,000,000 is to be raised by loans.;
The v financial experts of the country are discussing
how to provide additional taxes to supply the re
quired revenue, and to taxpayers generally that dis
cussion; is more interesting, than the reports of skir
mishes'and petty fights in; South Africa. Kitchener,
therefore, has very little opportunity to win gloÂ«y.
It appears he has been left in more senses than one.
ROBERTS AND KITCHENER.
Every American should be proud of the just part
our- Government has had in bringing about this re

view was made to dominate the situation.
Unless a breach of the peace come from that source
the world may expect a successful conclusion of the

justice, unstained by icvenge, all concerned can af

With peace and restoration of government there,
the negotiations for a final settlement can go on at
leisure. Meantime the more militant missionaries
need watching. They inzy attempt to return to the
Mk3dle Kingdom, where their rights rest upon for
eery, and when there to stir up more trouble in the
interest of their policy, which is the^ division of
China. This should not be permitted, and the repre
sentatives of the Governments should insist that re
ligion and diplomacy be kept apart until the terrible
issues already raised" by zeal that had no discretion
shall be settled.
In other words, acceptance of the protocol brings
reace to China, the thing most to be desired by her
and by the reasonable world outside.
protocol, but such it is, and no doubt was intended
to be by the United States. Its prompt acceptance
will put an end to th; raids for murder and robbery
in which Count Walderset has been pleased to in
culge, and will stop further outbreaks of the Chinese
themselves by reviving the power of their own Gov
ernment to govern.
TO a believer in justice to all men and all na
tions there is something amusing in the funk
of the European powers over Chinas calm ac
ceptance of the preliminary note. Perhaps the other
actions did not consider that note as equivalent to a
CHINESE DIPLOMACY.

-Jta line with the . proposed card, tha compass, rose on the chart should be
marked from 0' at north continuously to the right to 30Â°, omitting the present sys
tem of points. The sailing directions should give courses and bearings in degrees.
and not In points. The azimuth tables would require enly a change in the rules'
given at the bottom of the page, as follows:
When the latitude and declination are of the same or contrary name:
In north latitude the azimuth is the tabulated value when the time is a. m.
In north latitude the azimuth Is 360* minus the tabulated value when the time
is p. m.
In south latitude the azimuth is ISO 9 minus the tabulated value when the time
is a. m.
In south latitude the azimuth is 180Â° plus the tabulated value when the tlmÂ©
is p. m.
It is believed that the proposed markings of the compass card would result
in greater accuracy in navigation in its relation to the compass. Courses would
bp laid In degrees and more, accurately noted, as the approximate course of S"W
by W. }i*"W. "a little westerly," for example, would be replaced by the exact
course of 240 s . Chances of error in the application of the deviation to compass
courses would bÂ« lessened. Conversion of points into degrees and the reverse
would be eliminated from the problem. Boxing the compass would be a matter of
a few minutes' Instruction to the layman of average Intelligence. Sailing direc
tions would be simplified. All work in relation to the compass would ba facil
itated.

An experimental power rarba?* crema
tory Is to be built In Chicago. TfcÂ© Idea
in mind is to ascertain whether tha heat
developed by burning thÂ« city's garbaga
can be utilized to make an adequate re
turn upon the capital invested. This plan
Is In operation In several European clttÂ«d
of smaller size.
THE United States Hydrographic Office has decided that a simplified com-*
pass Is a necessity of the new century. It considers the "points" superflu
ous and suggests a much simpler contrivance, which it claims will give
better results. In order to. obtain the opinion of shipmasters the world
over It has Issued a circular accompanied by a dlagTam of the neÂ«r com- Â«
pass and a copy 0/ teach has been furnished or will be furnished to every ' ship
captain in United States ports. Every captain -will be aaked to forward his
opinion on the proposed change, and if the majority are favorable to It, then
Uncle Sam will adopt the new compass for use on all American vessels.
The proposed card Is illustrated In the accompanying drawing to ecale. and
corresponds in dimensions with the present United States % : navy standard 7Vi-inch
compass card. \
The circumference of the card Is divided Into the usual 360 degrees and
marked continuously to the right, from 0' at north to SO 3 at east, ISO' at south,
270Â° at west, and 3C0Â» at north. V -"^:,
The card Is subdivided as follows:
(a) Into divisions of 10 degrees, accentuated by hea.vy lines on;the graduated
rim, and by suitable geometric figures on the card, each 10-degree division of the
card being indicated in figures by Its appropriate number from 0* or north.
(b) Each lO-degree division of the card is further subdivided into half and
quarter divisions and appropriately marked.
(c) Every fifth-degree line of the graduated circle between the 10-degree di
visions Is marked In figures, Indicating Its appropriate number from 0* or north.
(d) The cardinal and intercardlnal directions are emphasized on' the card In
geometric figrures.
The present card contains points and degrees. The conversion of onÂ© Into tha
other is a natural result of the presence of both, but Is not a necessity, as
would speedily be recognized were the points omitted. Accuracy requires expres
sion in degrees for courses, bearings and compass errors, and not In points, the
uso of which is but a dupUcation of work.
A comparison of a few leading features of the present system with that pro
posed Is given below:
BY the decision of the Supreme Court on Friday
in the case of the Societe Italiana di Mutua.
i Beneficenza against the city and county of San
Francisco, the ordinance of 1897 prohibiting the
burial of the dead in the City or Golden Gate Ceme
tery was upheld, and it appears the. way; is now cleai
for closing all cemeteries within the city limits and
thus bringing about a reform which has long been
needed. (
In the particular case before the court the ordi
nance was upheld on a double count. The lots in the
City Cemetery occupied, by the society had been
granted to it by a former Board of Supervisors, and
the court, in upholding the ordinance prohibiting
further burials there, declared first that the Supervisory
had no right to grant land in the cemetery to a pri
vate corporation, as. the tract in question had been
turned over to them by an act of Congress; and,
secondly, that the Supervisory have the right to pass
any ordinance for the good of the community. It is
the second point of the decision which is of most im
portance to the city, for it'appears to sustain the right
and authority of the Supervisors to close all ceme
teries within the city limits whenever the good of the
community can be served by such action.
The question of closing the cemeteries has been
leng before the public, and all who are interested in
it are familiar with the arguments on both sides. It
is therefore not necessary to go over the subject
again. Suffice it to say that those who desire to bring
about the prevention of further burials within the
city limits have no intention to desecrate the graves
of the dead or in any way to offend the tendcrest
respect of the living for the resting-places of their
loved ones. The plan for preventing further burials
is nothing more than the following of a precedent
which has been adopted by every civilized city in the
world where intramural cemeteries exist. The old
order of things has been changed partly because the
increase of population has rendered it necessary, and
partly because modern science has disclosed the fact
that the burial of the dead within a crowded city in-
At the time the cemeteries in this city were estab
lished they- were remote from the habitations of the
people. It was not then foreseen that in a few years
the growth of population and the extension of street
car lines would soon expand the residence districts
far beyond those comparatively remote localities.
What was unexpected by the pioneers has happened.
The cemeteries are now surrounded by homes, and
they block the expansion of the city in districts that
are among the most desirable for residence purposes.
Sooner or later they will have to be closed against
further burials, and the sooner the reform comes the
better it will be.

It is announced; without a blush, that Kelly forced
his delegation to action as a forestalling move, and
to influence the country members, who, he says, "pre
fer the creation of a nucleus." He was engaged in
nucleus making, then, for the benefit of the country
members. He thinks they will "not desert the com
bination of Los Angeles and San Francisco."
Looking to the welfare of the State and the good
repute of the Republican party, we warn the country
members against any combination that is formed. by
Kelly. He is a man with no politics and no con
ception of principles. When he can make a better
bargain for spoils with a Democratic candidate he be
trays the Republican party and defeats it if he can.
His treacheries of this kind are recent â so recent that
his henchmen yet display their "duds" secured by
salaries won in the enjoyment of Democratic patron
age. Let the country members reflect, for a moment,
upon what would have happened had it been an
nounced last October that Boss Kelly would "create
a nucleus" and make "a combination" that would
make him the owner of the Speaker of the House!
Every man in the State knows that not a Republican
representative could have been elected in San Fran
cisco or Los Angeles. The people of the two coun
ties do not elect members for any such purpose. They
don't want a Speaker tagged and labeled, "I am the
chattel property of Martin Kelly."
While Kelly was occupied in creating a nucleus
t one member objected. He knew that he and his col
leagues were elected for a public purpose and not for
the private use of Boss Kelly. He was promptly
called a liar and knocked down by one of Kelly's men.
After that no one ventured to object. Such an ap
peal to reason was irresistible, and the member who
provoked it went forth for lotions and court plaster,
to repair the damages sustained from one of Kelly's
arguments.
We are curious to know what such gentlemen as
McKinlay, Horace Davis, William R. Davis and Re
! publicans of their kind all over the State think of
Martin Kelly's nucleus. They are the kind of men
! put forward in campaigns to advocate the principles
: of the party and to conjure in its name, as represent
| ing its quality and the character of citizenship that
| prefers it. Suppose, again, that in the last campaign
! they had been silent, and Martin Kelly, John C
| Lynch, E. M. Buckley, Jere Burke and Eddie Con
i roy had been sent out on the stump to uphold Re
publicanism! Does any one believe there would have
been a two-third Republican majority in the Legisla
ture?
Why should not the men whose character com
mends the party to the voters be considered leading
' Republicans after the election? Why should their
j influence cease as soon as the votes are counted, and
i Martin Kelly step out as the dictator of the party, the
I beneficiary of its victor)' and the owner in fee of its
House of Representatives? The country members
j hope that this is not the last Republican victory in
| California. They want a future for themselves and
their party. They don't want its epitaph to be:
Died of Martin
Kelly's Nucleus.
CITY politics has always been considered in this
country a hard formation, but it is doubtful
whether it ever showed harder. than in Kelly's
bossing of the job in San Francisco.
If the delegation from this city, of its own mind,
judgment and- will, chose to take the somewhat un
usual step of unanimously supporting a canflidate for
Speaker of the House, the comment would run as an
objection to forestalling the action of the caucuÂ§*Â«f all
the members of that bod}-. But when the delegation
coes not act of its own mind, will and judgment, but
meets merely to indorse Boss Kelly's selection for
Speaker, the action has in it more serious features. It
means simply that Kelly desires to own the Speaker,
the committees and the machinery of the House. To
say that the people whose votes made the immense
Republican majority in this city cast those votes to
enable Boss Kelly to own a Speaker and control the
House would be to utter fantastic, nonsense." The
.members of the Uou5.e hold a trust for the people,
and are not the tools end trustees of Kelly. If they
act as his agents they betray the people. .^1 â¢

holiday. The memory of man runneth not
back to the time when that day was first
observed as a holiday, nor is there any

that day being held sacred to Janus Bl

Judpe "William R. Dainperfleld gained
fifty-four votes yesterday in his contest
to the election, which brings his net gain
to date up to 221 votes. In addition to
his large gain, those who are conducting
Judge Daingerneld's side of the contest
believe they have discovered direct evi
dence of fraud In the Fourteenth Precinct
of the Thirty-third District.
During the recounting of ballots in that
precinct yesterday seventeen votes cast
for Judge Daingerfleld were thrown out
on the ground that the stub numbers were
not detached from the ballots, four votes
cast for him were thrown out on the
ground .|hat five long-term Judge.? had
been voted for and one vote was thrown
out that was cast for him on the ground
that it'bore a distinguishing mark. This
makes twenty-two votes cast for Judge
Dalngerfield. At the end of the recount
he was credited with having received
twenty-six legal votes. Adding those
tlyown out to those allowed as legal by
the court, the number of ballots actually
cast for him is forty-eight. With no
votes thrown out the oincial figures of the
Election Commission credit him with only
thirty-eight votes, a discrepancy against
him of ten votes.
On the other hand, Graham lost twenty
votes that contained the number stub,
seven votes by reason of five long-term
Judges having been voted for, on the bal
lots and one vote by reason of its bearing
a distinguishing mark. Thus his total
loss was twenty-eight votes, which, added
to the number credited to him after the
recount, thirty-two, makes but sixty votes
cast for him, while the official figures
credit him with having received sixty
four votes in this precinct, a discrepancy
in his favor of four votes. The total
number of votes thus fraudulently, it is
alleged, counted in Oraham's favor is
fourteen. Further investigation of the
discrepancy in the figures will be made
to-day.
Altogether thirty-seven votes were
thrown out as illegal by reason of the
number stub remaining on the baJIot. It
is hinted that these numbers were de
signedly permitted to remain on the bal
lots by tha election officer whose duty it
was to tear them off and that the fact
will play an important part in the Assem
bly contest between Strand and Butler.
Judge Daingerfleld's gain of 221 votes
has been made in ninety-three precincts.
He is still behind 155 votes, but 210 pre
cincts remain to be counted. Several
persons are now keeping snap tallies and
the close of the Daingerfield-Graham con
test may see the inauguration of many
others.

FAVOR IMPROVEMENTS
With change of rulers and policy came
change of fortune. Within twelve years
the greater part of the gains In America
that had come to Great Britain by the
settlement of 1763 were lost by the turn
of war and. diplomacy. To Great Britain
the treaty of 17S3 was almost as disastrous
as that of 1763 had been glorious. The
gains won by the statesmanship of Pitt
and the sacrifice and valor of Wolfe In
the seven years' war were sacrificed by
the folly and stupidity of a stubborn kin?.
The taxing policy of George III and Gren
ville and the punitive and coercive meas
ures by which they sought to enforce It
alienated the affections of loyal colonists,
and by the declaration of Independence
Great Britain lost her colonies in America,
for whose safety and progress she had
made such strenuous efforts. France, see
ing an opportunity to recover her Ameri
can possessions or to embarrass and re
tard the progress and prosperity of Brit
ain In America, made common cause with
the colonies, and In ber famous alliance
with us in 1778 she brought on tha fourth
war over America between these two
great . rival nations. Spain was still an
ally of France. Although Spain did not
come Into formal alliance with us, as we
earnestly besought her to do by Jay'8
mission to Madrid in 1779, yet she made a
common enemy of - Great Britain by an
independent war, in the hope of secur
ing Gibraltar (held by Great Britain since
the treaty of Utrecht, 1713) and of increas
ing her American possessions. George
III had permitted a betrayal of the Brit
ish alliance with Frederick the Great, the
rising King of Prussia, in 17G1, and now
from 1779 to 1782, without any ally in the
world and with divided councils at honn
England was facing a combination of
powers calculated to accomplish her ut
ter undoing. It is, then, to the boundary
settlements of 17S3, following the ward
connected with our revolution, that we
como as the next landmark in our study.
We can but briefly outline the negotia
tions and results of the settlement. -
After Great Britain acquired Canada
from France in 1763 she soon attempted by
the Quebec act of 1774 to extend the
boundary of Quebec southward to the
Ohio River. This extension of a province
under tho Catholic religion both offended
the religious feeling of New England and
Interfered with the prospect of national
expansion westward. The Quebec act was
an offense to the American colonies, and,
passed at a time when Parliament seemed
bent upon the repression and coercion of
the colonies, it was one of the causes of
the American revolution. The consum
mation of its purpose was prevented by
the outbreak of the revolution and the
expedition of George Rogers Clark, who
obtained practical military possession of
the Northwest at Kaskaskla and Vin
cennes. \It was partly this military pos
session, won in 1778-i\ that enabled the
diplomacy of Jay and Franklin and
Adams to win for the young republic a
boundary on the Mississippi.
It seems quite strange that when our
diplomats came to negotiate for our
boundary settlement in 1782 they had to
meet the secret opposition of their friends
while they received liberal, if not unex
pected, concessions from their enemies.
Spain was confessedly looking out* for
herself. But in the war with Great Brit
ain France was our ally, and it had been
agreed * that neither France nor America
should make a final treaty without the
consent of the other. By a fatuous policy
Congress had given our commissioners in
structions not to enter lnt\ negotiations
with England without imparting to the
French Cabinet privy knowledge of their
proceedingsâ instructions which would
fcave proved fatal to our Interests if they
had been observed, and which had prob
ably been obtained through French in
fluence. France and Spain In the nego
tiations of 17S2 were both using secret in
fluence against us in seeking to limit our
western boundaries at the Alleghanies.
while Great Britain readily came to a
boundary agreement that led Vergennes
to say that Britain had "bought rather
than made a treaty." If our commission
ers, largely through Jay's insistence, had
not proceeded in disregard of their in
structions (by which they were bound to
take France into iheir confidence) we
might have been forced to agree to a
boundary quite different from the one ob
tained..
Jay w;as sent to Spain in 1779 for the
purpose ' of obtaining money, an alliance
and a port of deposit on 'the lower Mis
sissippi, lie obtained precious little
money, and neither' an alliance nor the
right to navigate the Mississippi. After
vexatious delays he was transferred to
Paris to aid Franklin and Adams In final
negotiations for peace. During these ne
gotiations Jay entered into conference
with Count d'Aranda, who represented
Spain at the court of Paris. Of one of
these conferences Jay says:
Opening Mitchell's large map of North Amer
ica he (D'Aranda) asked me what wÂ£re our
boundaries. I told him from the head of the
Mississippi to 31 degrees north, thence east by
the line between Georgia and Florida. D'Ar
anda objected. He claimed that the western
country had never belonged to the colonies, and
that by the Spanish conquest of West Florida
and certain posts on the Mississippi and the
Illinois It became vested In Spain; and if
Spanish right of conquest did not extend over
all that country It was still possessed by free
and Independent nations of Indians, whose
landn we could not consider with any pro
priety as belonging to us. D'Aranda then traced
with red ink on the map a line which he pro
poned should form our western boundary. This
ran from a lake near tha confines of Georgia,
but east of the Flint River, to the confluence
of the- Kanawha with the Ohio, thence round
the western shores of Lakes Erie and Huron
and thence round Lake Michigan to Lake Su
perior.
This line was supported by the French
influence. Jay disclaimed such plenipoten
tiary power as would enable him to cede
away the territory of his country, and,
with Franklin and AdaÂ»ns, constantly in
sisted upon the Mississippi as our western
boundary. RaynevaJ. *he secretary to
Vergennes, the French Minister, com
â¢ bated our claims and -he finally proposed,
on behalf of the French Cabinet, what he
called a "conciliatory line." Quoting the
British proclamation of 1763 (by which
England erected tho provinces of East
and West Florida) Vergennes' communi
cation said:
This declares in a precise and positive man
ner that the lands in question are situated be
tween the Mississippi and the ancient English
establishments. It is therefore clearly evi
dent that the court of London Itself, when It
was as yet sovereign of the thirteen colonies,
did not consider these lands as forming part
of said colonies. 1
The "conciliatory line." then proposed
by France, was a tortuous one running
north from the- gulf to the mouth of the
Cumberland. On the east of this line
there should be Indian possessions under
the protection â¢ of , America, and on ,the
west of the line Indian possessions under
the protection of Spain. And Spain should
have the exclusive navigation of the Mis*

The differences between Spain and tha
United States over the navigation of the
Mississippi and the boundary of Florida
may best be studied in connection with
our acquisition of Louisiana and Florida-
While the cession of Louisiana by Franca
to the United States in lSi'3 was not tha
result of a war between these two powers,
it was the result of a war situation in
Kurope. By a secret treaty in 1S00 Na
poleon had forced from Spain the retro
cession of Louisiana. This accession of
French power at the mouth of the Mla-
Fissippi was startling to America. Napo
leon believed, that Jefferson -would make
good his proposal to marry America to
the English nation and navy and that
France in the Kuropean war just immi
nent could not hold ita new American col
ony. He was therefore willing to strength
en America at the expense of England.
France had received Louisiana, "with the
same boundaries that it now has in the
hands of Spain, and that it had when
F"rance possessed it." This language was
ambiguous ; its two clauses are contradic
tory. Napoleon told Talleyrand that if
there were not an uncertainty as to the
limits of Louisiana it would be well to
make one. The uncertainty contained in
the ambiguous treaty clauses above be
came the basis of our claim to West Flor
ida. Louisiana "as France possessed it,"
before 1763, included a part of West Flor
ida; but Louisiana as it then was "in tho
handa of Spain" did not. Our poorly
founded claim to West Florida reopened
our disputes with Spain, which were not
again settled till we had acquired both,
the Florida- 1 ? In 1810.
We conclude this article- with a brief
summary of these disputes and their set
tlement.
After the general peace of 17SC the Span
ish court still persisted In It3 policy of
excluding the Americans from the navi
gation of the Mississippi. The fine river
which tho Western settlers daily saw
flowing before their doors they held to
be the natural highway that God had
made for them as their rightful outlet
to the sea. To have to transport their
productsâ flour, wheat, timber, tobacco â
otherwise through forest and wilderness,
or to use the great river only by thÂ©
sufferance of Spanish officials and a cor
poral's guard of Spanish soldiers was be
yond endurance. Spain also refused to
recognize the thirty-first parallel as tha
south boundary of the United State3 be
tween the Mississippi and the Appalachl
cola. She maintained that the Floridaa
ceded to her by Great Britain in 17S3 wera
the Floridas as they had been governed
by British officials from 17S3 to 17S3. By
the noted proclamation of 1763 England
divided the Floridas by the line- of the
Appalachicola. West Florida was made
up of a part of Louisiana (between ths
Pearl and the Mississippi) received from
France; and the north" boundary of Flor
ida was fixed at the thirty-first parallel.
But in the English commissions to tha
governors of West Florida the boundaries
of that province were pushed farther
north to the parallel 32Â° 30" on a line from
the mouth of the Yazoo to the Appalachi
cola. When we entered into the pro
visional treaty with Great Britain In 1S72
fixing our south bojmdary at 21Â°, no treaty
had yet been concluded between Great
Britain and Spain. So a separate and
secret article was inserted in this treaty
which provided that if the Floridas should
be restored to Great Britain (Spain had
won military possession of Pensacola. Mo
bile and Natchez during tho "war), tha
south boundary of the i:nltÂ«*d States be
tween the Mississippi and the Chatta
hoochee (called the Appalachtcola after
its junction with the Flint) %nould be the
parallel of 22Â° 30\
Therefore, after Britain had ceded th*
Floridas to Spain without a statement of
boundaries; after the Spanish Cabinet had
learned of out secret agreement to the
boundary of 32 degrees SO minutes as be
tween us and England. Gardoqui. the
Spanish Minister, insisted that the Eng
lish-American agreement to 31 degrees as
against Spain could not affect the rights
of Spain, then in possession by right of
conquest; that these territories were fai
the possession of neither England nor of
the United States when they assumed to
dispose of them, and that Florida should
extend as far north as when under Eng
lish control. We were not "a little em
barrassed by the difficulty. But wo did
not grant away our claims; though we
did not secure from Spain a recognition of
a port cf deposit at the mouth of the Mis
sissippi until our treaty with her In 17D5.
When Spain re-ceded Louisiana to
France In 1S0O she did not. of course, re
cede West Florida, which she had ob
tained from England and not -from
France. On the impertinent plea tha't
France once .possessed a part of West
Florida we based our claim to that region.
We finally took military possession, and
Spain was not in a position to oust us.
Spain did not recognize our title to West
Florida until she was forced to sell East
Florida in 1813. The Seminole war brought
on in 1817-1S by the constant "use of East
Flprlda as a base of smuggling expedi
tions against the United States ar.d of
lawless raids of Indians, and as a refuge
for fugitive slaves and outlaws, lpd "Old

SPRING VALLEY
MAKES PROTEST
San Francisco merchants are wondering
how Surgeon J. H. White will proceed to
investigate . the acts of Dr. Kinyoun as
United States quarantine officer at this
port. Surgeon White is an assistant of
the surgeon general of the United States.
He came to this city having in his pos
session â¢ the correspondence that has
passed between the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce and the Treasury De
partment, based on complaints made by
the merchants and shipping men against
Dr. Kinyoun. No doubt is entertained
here that Surgeon White came to San
Francisco by. reason of the presentation
of facts by the Chamber of Commerce.
Nevertheless, although two days have
elapsed since he arrived here the secre
tary of the Chamber. Mr. Scott, acting
under instructions to visit Surgeon White,
has not been able to meet him.
l^ast evening George A. Newhall. vice
president and acting president of the
Chamber, said that Mr. Scott, as secre
tary, had left his card at the hotel where
Surgeon White Is stopping. That act
would notify Dr. White that the Chamber
desired -to communicate with him, Mr.
Newhall said, and If Surgeon White did
not acknowledge receiving- this the Cham
ber would probably stand on Its dignity
and not try again to communicate with
hira.
Surgeon White was interviewed last
evening- and declared that he had not seen
any of those who have complained of Dr.
Kinyoun, and that If they wanted to see
him they must come to him, for he would
not hunt them up.
On the face of things, accordingly, there
appeared last evening to be a possibility
that the Chamber of Commerce will not
have the opportunity to present the facts
in its possession concerning Dr. Kinyoun's
acts. All over town there was a suspicion
that Surgeon White was preparing to
"whitewash" Dr. Kinyoun. The two were
together the most of and yes
terday. They found time to visit Attor
ney Banning, who is preparing a defense
for the quarantine officer to a petition for
an injunction by Chinese merchants. But
up to the hour of closing the secretary's
office of the Chamber of Commerce last
evening no acknowledgment had conio
from Surgeon White of the courtesy paid
by the Chamber in calling upon him.
The San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce includes in its membership the most
prominent men in commerce, finance and
manufacturing in this city. The trustees
who asked the Secretary of the Treasury
to instruct the quarantine officer "to per
form the duties of his office with such
tact and judgment as will enable travelers
to enter this port without being exposed
to insult, needless delay, hardship and
anxiety" are: Charles Nelson. George A.
Newhall, H. F. Allen, Wakefleld Baker,
E. R. Dimond. A. B. Field, H. F. Fort
mann, William Haas, C. D. Haven, W.
H. Marston, George W. McNear Jr., Wil
liam E. Mighell, H. Rosenfeld. A. G.
Towne and Charles M. Yates, rII repre
sentative business men of San Francisco.
Their action had sufficient weight with
the Government to cause Surgeon White
to be eent here, under the supposition that
a real investigation would take place.
Vice President George A. Newhall said
last evening: "The Chamber of Commerce
Is prepared to supply to Dr. White all the
facts bearing on our charge* if he wishes
them. I have instructed Mr. Scott, our
secretary, to 8i range for a special meet-
Ing of our trustees if Dr. White desires
to confer with us. If that meeting comes

Argument Before Fire
Committee. .
Fire Chief Sullivan appeared before the
Supervisors' Fire Committee yesterday
and spoke in favor of the proposed ordi
nance regulating the construction of au
tomatic sprinkler equipments for build
ing and manufacturing plants. H/fe said
the sprinklers were of great benefit in
checking the progress of fires and put
ting them out. Chief Engineer Schussler
of the Spring Valley Water Works,pro
tested in a communication against com
pelling tho company to lay six-Inch ser
vice pipes from its mains to supply the
sprinkler apparatus. He- argued that it
would be unsafe to do so, as the pipes
might be unavailable by reason of a
break in the main pipe or if the water
should be shut off to repair the main. The
company, he said, would approve the plan
only if large storage tanks should be the
direct means of supplying water for auto
matic sprinklers. lie said the company
had not required a tank for the sprinkler
system in the Emporium building because
the Parrott estate had granted In return
a very valuable right of way for a pipe
line in San Mateo, which money could not
buy.
Attorneys Gould and Forbes had a
wordy tilt over the fact that Schussler
had sent a communication Instead of ap
pearing In person. Forbes said Schussler
was too busy to attend the meeting,
whereupon Gould retorted that Schussler
was not too busy to take a three months'
trip to Europe.
"So are we all busy men," said Chair
man Curtis. "Let Mr. Schussler be noti
fied to attend the next meeting, when
some action on the ordinance will be
taken."
The Street Committee reported In favor
of establishing the width of the sidewalks
on Alabama street, from Potrero avenue
to Carolina street, at twelve feet.

Surgeon J. L. White arrived at the Oc
cidental Hotel on Tuesday last and since
that time has kept himself in seclusion,
giving orders that no one was to see him.
Dr. Ktnyoun has been constantly in com
pany with Surgeon â¢ White and has en
deavored to prevent any Interested parties
to the controversy from seeing the sur
geon.
When Surgeon White and Dr. Kinyoun
returned yesterday evening to the Occi
dental Hotel the Matter answered a query
as to the whereabouts of Surgeon White
by saying that he could be found at the
Marine Hospital, four nilles away from
the hotel. As a matter of fact Surgeon
"White had a few seconds before been
seated with Kinyoun In the hotel lobby
and the surgeon had simply stepped to
the hotel desk to make an Inquiry.
Surgeon White denied when asked that
he had been sent out here to Investigate
Kinyoun. When told that Assistant Sec
retary Spaulding of the treasury had
spoken of an investigation to be conduct
ed by White the latter reluctantly admit
ted that he was in San Francisco for that
purpose. Â¦ â¢ Â¦â¢:

"but know nothing of my being instructed
to specially investigate Dr. Kinyoun's
conduct. If, of course, there has been any
friction between Dr. Kinyoun and the
business community of San Francisco I
suppose that in the line of my duties I
would make an investigation."
Surgeon White was asked if It was not
a fact that he had in his possession all
the correspondence which had -passed be
tween the Chamber of Commerce of this
city and the Treasury Department as to
the conduct of Kinyoun.
"Well, yes, I have that correspondence,"
he finally admitted.
Surgeon White was asked If it was not
likely that tho Treasury Department
would "whitewash" Kinyoun.
"Neither the heads of the department
nor myself prejudge any case," answered
Surgeon White, "and I decline to express
any opinion as to the merits of the case.
I have not seen any of these people who
have complained against Dr. Kinyoun and
do not propose to hunt them up. If, they
want to see me they must come to me."
Surgeon White was not averse to dis
cussing the characteristics of bubonic
plague and stated that he had the great
est faith in Dr. Kinyoun's judgment. He
dwelt on the fact that the quarantine offi
cer had studied bubonic plague in Paris.
"If Dr. Kinyoun diagnosed a case as
plague," said Surgeon White, "I should
have faith in what he reported. Kinyoun
is one of the greatest bacteriologists in
the world. Why should he want to do
anything to hurt the interests of San
Francisco or act in spite, as has been
claimed?"
Although Surgeon White had a few
minutes before declined to express him
self as to the merits of the controversy
he was not averse to lauding Dr. Kin
youn.
In spite of the wild wind and rain storm
last night, a large house greeted the Yaie
Banjo and Glee Clubs at their concert ut
Metropolitan Temple, and signified its
enthusiasm by encoring the whole pro
gramme. Tho hall was charmingly dec
orated with palms and the national em
blems and, with the chiffons and ermines
of societyâ which was out in full force
made a very pretty picture. The pro
gramme opened with aii impromptu Yale
yell from the back of tho house by thÂ«
Harvard and Princeton men amone Iho
audience, to which the Yale students
smilingly responded, after which exchange
of college courtesies The banjo club gavo
the opening march. Tne programme in
cluded the usual Yale songs, a number of
the popular coon songs of the day, a sen
timental ballad or so. and some effective
Instrumental numbers by the banjo and
mandolin clubs. The glee club, which
numbers twenty-four members, gave its
songs with much spirit and dash, and wa<
accorded a hearty welcome by the many
New Haven, as well as California folk in
the audience. Mr. tjchneeloch. president
of the club, Mr. Spaulding, Mr. Sheehan
Mr. Read, Mr. Welch and Mr. Tyler were
among the soloists.
The second and final concert by the col
lege boys will be given this afternoon at
2 o'clock, at the Grand Opera-house.
The Yale boys were given a warm re
ception at the Palace Hotel after their
concert last evening. The party which
assembled to greet the wearers of the
blue was one of the largest and most
select of the season. Many of San Fran
cisco's most prominent society people
were there.
From 10 o'clock until- 1 this morning
dancing was enjoytd. Through an over
sight no music was provided and until an
orchestra could be procured several mem-'
bers of the banjo club volunteered to
play, thereby avoiding an unpleasant in
terruption In the festivities.
The patronesses were Mrs. Henry F.
Allen, . Mrs. Gordon Blanding, Mrs. Wil

Donald T. Campbell. Mrs. MJiiliam H.

WHITE IS IGNORING
KINYOUN'S ACCUSERS
CRUDE RUBBER
RETAINS VALUE
Threatened Reduction by the
Trust Is Not Tit
The United States Rubber Company,
the concern which controls two million
and a half dollars' worth of the stock of
the recently organized crude rubber trust,
formed to .control cru/le rubber figures
throughout the world, failed yesterday to
send the jobbers of this city notice of the
reduction In price of that article,' despite
the fact that a short time ago It distrib
uted notices to the jobbers warning them
of tho projected cut. The inference which
the latter draw from this is that the
threatened reduction has not been made
because of the accession of the small
ilrms to the demands of the combine.
Many jobbers, however, received yester
day sealed envelopes from the combine
presumably containing the* schedule of
prices which will prevail under, the new
combine's direction. The receipt of these
communications was followed almost Im
mediately by a telegram emanating from
the same source asKing the early return
of the former with the seals unbroken,
which many Jobbers consider an equiva
lent to a declaration that nothing more
is to be done in the matter until April 1,
when the company's contracts witn the
jobbers expire. Supporting testimony to
this theory is the fact that when the
trust was organized the Jobbers had on
hand large quantities of goods bought
under the terms of contracts entered into
before the formation of the trust. By de
ferring the reduction of prices until the
expiration of the present contracts the
combine escapes the necessity of paying
the jobbers the original contract price
for such goods as they may. have bought
under the terms of that contract; -a ne
cessity which would Indubitably Â¦ involve
a large expense to the combine.- \-
I. Cthn of Cahn, Nlckelsburg & Co. said
yesterday In reference to the matter: Â¦
"The cause of this sudden move on the
part of the combine is a mystery to me.
In accordance with a circular received
some little time ago from the combine. I
was prepared to receive to-day some noti
fication as to what the new . scale of
prices was to be. The message I received
from them, which I suppose contained
their Instructions, was speedily followed
by another demanding the return of the
first. I think it likely that they may wish
to wait until the present contracts with
the jobbers expire, thereby avoiding the
necessity of paying the jobbers the dif
ference between the reduction and what
they had paid for their stock under those
contracts. -
R. II. Pease, president of the Goodyear
Rubber Company, the Pacific Coast agent
for the United States Rubber Company's
goods, denied that his principals had sent
out any, notice to the jobbers. He says
that no action will be taken by the com
bine until to-day. â¢

FIFTY TONS OF CANDY
Have Been Sent to Our Soldiers in the
Philippine Islands by the Gov-
Flfty tons of candy have been sent to
the soldiers in the Philippine Islands by
the commissary department of the army
during the last three months and large
amounts to the soldiers In Cuba and Porto
Rico.
This is done upon advice of the medical
officers of the army, because it is a phy-
siological fact that a moderate consump-
tion of confectionery promotes health and
satisfies a natural craving of the stomach.
Candy was never furnished to the
United States army ! before, although it
has been commonly used -as a ration by
the French and â¢ British troops In the
tropics.
This explodes another pld-faahloned
theory that sweets were Injurious to the
digestive organs, while a moderate use of
sweets Is actually beneficial.
Very few things are injurious and the
food cranks who advocate the use of a
few grains and vegetables and decry the
use of sweets and meats are in error, as
a wholesome variety of meat and vege-
table food is absolutely; necessary for the
maintenance of tha highest condition of
health. .
The best rule to follow is to eat what
the appetite craves, and If there Is any
discomfort or trouble In. digesting" meat
and sweets the difficulty can be readily,
overcome by the regular use after, meals
of some safe digestive composed of pep-
sin and diastase which will assist \hc
stomach by increasing the flow of gastric
Juice and furnish the -natural peptone
lacking in weak Etomachs.
The best preparation of this kind is
probably Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
which may be found at all drug stores. -
Years of use have demonstrated the
value and effectiveness of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets'in all cases of . impaired
digestion.

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW TORK, Jan. 3.â The long-expected
etcna of liquidation broke over the stock mar
ket to-day and swept prices In a torrent of
eellir.g on a downward course, which was not
effectually checked even at the close of the
market. There were wide breaks by that time
and the precipitate celling ga\e the market
the appearance of a no m. -demoralization.
speculators who were long of stocks showed
many of the symptoms of panic in their scram
ble to save the profit which the prolonged rise
had created for them on paper. The market
was so topheavy hy reason of. the vast num
ber of accounts on narrow margins 'which in
fested it that the fall In prices gained mo
mentum as it proeres&ed. The widening out
of margins with the decrease in the face value
of stocks forced them to 6ale to prevent losses
by the broken". Whether any of the liquida
tion beyond this was forced would be difficult
to eay. The money market maintained a calm
eurface all day, the call lean rate ruling at
t% per cent or below that. There was a con
tinued shifting of loans, however. Incident to
it- enormous financial transactions involved In
the yearly settlement and the disturbance of
loans thus caused added to the unsettled feel
ing in the stock market. " The clearings to
day were I5S0.122.00C. which, with the single
exception of yesterday, is the largest total on
record. Many cauees are assigned to account
lor thÂ« violent break, but the real root of
the trouble was fhat faith in the level of prices
began to be Impaired and a conviction was
borne In upon speculators that the large de
mand for stocks which they have expected to
continue during January has been pretty large
ly discounted. Of the causes contributory to
the flump most importance must be attached
to the advance In the Bank of England's dis
count rat*, which rose from 4 to 5 per cent.
Cabled reports from Ixwidon described gloomy
forebodings over the future, and the result
was a eharp Jump in sterling exchange rates
in New Tork and growth of a belief that the
New York money market will be called upon
for gold to relieve the strained condition of
the foreign money markets. The heavy liqui
dation in Sugar had a very unsettling effect
en sentiment, in which lt was commonly at
tributed to a veil-known steel magnate, who
has made hiÂ« mark heretofore on the bear

in the rubber stocks on the reduction In the

CHICAGO. Jan. 8.â Wheat had an irregular,
nervous day. Under the depressing Influence of
unresponsive Liverpool cables, 'Â¦ May opened %c
lower to unchanged at 76%Â©77%o. On buying
caused by light Northwest receipts a rally to
77*dic followed. The bulge moved to action the
desire for profits and a slump to 76% c was the
result. On this decline stop-loss orders came
out and there was even some short selling. The
corn strength then became an Influence and on
covering May recovered to 77?4c. Again sales
to secure profits became the order of the day
and as the recent broad demand was lacking
prices responded readily to the pressure. May
declined to "CVic and closed weak. %c under
yesterday at 76%c. There was scarcely any
cash business, prices being out of line.
Corn was moderately active. The market
opened easier on the good weather, but turned
strong on a good cash demand. The close was
firm, with May He higher at 37e.
Oats were fairly active and generally strong,
although there was some easiness at the start
on bull selling. May closed V t c higher at 24%c.
Provisions opened easy, but turned strong on
a good cash demand, particularly for pork and
ribs. Shorts and outside Interests were well
represented in the buying. Prices eased from
the top on profit taking, but the c'.ose. was
firm. May pork closed 22*)4Â®25c higher, lard
2HS5c up and ribs 10c Improved.

WHEATâ Although Liverpool and Parts fu
tures were both higher, the reaction at Chicago
expected on Wednesday was marked. "While
there, was no pronounced decline, either there
or at New Tork, the feeling was easier. At
the opening at Chicago there were large hold
ings for strong and aggressive parties, and it
was believed that the general speculative sen
timent was working into grain. Later on.
however, traders, in the absence of outside
buying orders, began to sell, and the market
declined. St. Louis also did some selling. The
foreigners likewise sold, but the Minneapolis
millers bought all they could get hold of. Con
siderable Wheat was dumped on stop orders.
The market was not without bullish features,
however. The Cincinnati Price Current said
that the Wheat supply Is now from 25,000,000
to 35,000,000 bushels less than a year ago, but
that the surplus Is larger than ever exported
during the - closing half of the season. One
large. Minneapolis company, operating 135
houses along the Great Northern Railroad, took
in only 3500 bushels yesterday, though the
roads are In perfect Â¦ condition for market
ing. A lot of 150.000 bushels was reported taken
for export.
. The San Francisco market was weaker again,
both on and off call, with decreased trading.

Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says: "The
â¢prospects for the cctnlng year, as vlswed under
the infiuence of Deceit ber's record, are most
excellent, and there Is no reason to believe
that tie coming twelve months will be one
whit less prosperous than were 'hose of thÂ«
year Just closing.
"The same old trouble relative tÂ«. :he secur
ing of suitable and available vessels for the
transportation cf the lumber manufactured at
the r^any coast pine and redwood mills is still
attracting attention lrcm the millmen them
selves, and !t Is to be hoped that the next six
months will see several new Eteam schooners
enter upen the coast route. ThÂ« mills need ad
ditions to the present fleet for two reasons,
main and Important in two conditions; first,
thsi.t the manufactured lumber would then bÂ«
f?ulÂ»Jecl to no possible delay In ehl&ment, and
ttie second, that the addition of the new craft
would tend to reduce the present prevailing
tiph rates. Tho next three months will find
r.ew vessels here la this port, plying between
the northern and southern ports, for several
are being constructed U*th In the Western and
Eastern States. This feature of delay and
high rates eliminated, the lumber business of
this city and vicinity will assume an entirely
new aspect and greater encouragement will be
offered to outside lnteretts to enter this field
cf lumber activities."

Every Respect.
France's new prison at Fresnes, some
eight miles, from Paris, is the largest la
the world. It takes the place of three
old prisons. Is situated tn a healthy dis
trict and covers, with itÂ»* main buildings,
flower gardens and villa residence of of
ficials, over half a square mile.
The prison, unlike our penitentiaries. Is
not built on the star plan, but consists of
five rectangular blocks, one of which Is
the infirmary. The plan Is the cellular,
and the number of cells reaches the hugr*
total of 1SC4. ' As. however, accommoda
tion Is provided on the "association" sys
tem for 400 privileged prisoners, the total
criminal capacity of the Fresnes prison is
2224. As a sanitarium for the criminal
Fresnes is unique. As his or her present
home lt boasts the proud record of belns
only half full of crime, or at least punish
ment by imprisonment for crime, Is dim
inishing in France.
The system at FYesnes 13 Interesttaiyâ
possibly lt is worthy of imitation. Tho
authorities believe in fresh air and sun
shine, those sworn tots, of tfc.e microbe
and friends of health. Hence, as already
stated, the prison Is a model sanitarium.
Otherwise the criminal Is gently educated.
He works at some trade and can purchase,
from the proceeds of his work extra food
and personal requirements â with the ex
ception of tobacco. "When the prisoners
go to worship, which is not compulsory,
or to "school," which Is, they wear hood3
so as to prevent mutual recognition on re
lease. In some of the workshops this
rule does not obtain. The reason for this
apparent Inconsistency is not clear.
Even the officials receive instructions on
such subjects a3 the prevention of crime*
and prison discipline, and as a result of
this the excellent idea of the whole prison
is admirably carried out. A final feature
of Fresnes is the severe simplicity of its
architecture compared with the baronial
style of many of our prisons. â London

Â¦ The, local , situation, following this informa

chiefly to supplying immediate requirements.

the case of The Sanitary Reduction Works
vs. The California Reduction Company
On behalf of the defendant appeared Gar
ret McEnerney; and Attorneys Learning
and Harding. Attorneys Percy Mitchell
and Tilden appeared for the plaintiff. Tha
argument will be resumed this morning.
About a year ago the plaintiff was
granted a fifty-year franchise to burn all
garbage collected in San Francisco and
to collect 20 cents per cubic yard for th->
service. It being the most valuable feature
of the franchise that the grantee was to
have an absolute monopoly of the busi
ness of disposing of garbage. The defend
ant collected garbage and had it trans
ported on barges to S^ji Mateo County
where it was disposed of. The plaintiff
thereupon asked for an injunction alleg
ing that the defendant was Infringing un
lawfully upon its franchise. -
Testimony was taken in the case'several
months ago by Unite-1 States Court Com
missioner Heacock, and the matter was
argued yesterday upon the transcript of
that proceeding. Mr. McEnerney occupied
the whole of the afternoon In contending
that the franchise is as illegal and tha*
the injunction prayed for should not bo
granted.

Varney W. Oaskill, secretary of the
California commission which had charge
of this State's exhibit at the Paris expo
sition, returned home Tuesday with his
wife and Is at the Occidental. Mr. Gas
kill speaks very highly of this State's
showing at the exposition. He says that
out of 400 exhibits made by California,
f<5 per cent were awarded prizes, which is
an exceptional record, especially since all
â¢wines having foreign names were ex
cluded from the competition. As is well
known, some of California's best wine
products have French names. â¢
Mr. Oaskill says that California got
more free advertising from the fair than
almost any other State or county repre
sented. The commission personally un
dertook the work of sending out books in
Krench. German and English, descriptive
of the varied industries in the state. He
tides the books maps showing the agricul
tural, hori^ultural, climatic and mining
interests of the State were sent to every
board of trade, chamber of commerce,
educational Institution and hotel in Eu
rope. The State received its highest
medals for its display of agricultural,
horticultural, forestry, mining and iishery
interests. These medals will be displayed
In one. of the local mercantile houses the
coming week.
Mr. Gaskill says that the exposition was
a success and that the majority of the
American people who visited it were Â¦well
satisfied with what they saw and learned.
The exposition showed conclusively that
the United States is away ahead of other
countries in nearly every branch of in
dustry.

St. Luke's Hospital was plunged into
darkness last night, due to the breaking
outside the bulletins of the electric light
wires by the wind. The nurses and doc
tors hunted for oil lampj and candles, and
with a few gas jets the temporary gloom
of the hospital wards was dissolved.
During the height of the storm last
night a large part of the high fence sur
rounding the vacant lot next to the Stan
yan-street police station was blown, to
the ground. Fortunalely no one was
passing at the time.
The old City and County Hospital
building stood the test of the storm's
fury for the second time this season. A
big tree that had kept sunlight and fresh
air from the building went Dy the roots,
much to the Joy of all connected with the
hospital. It was one of the largest in the
group of trees within the lnclosure. The
city will save some money in fuel, as the
fallen tree will be cut up for kindling
wood. The old fence stood Its ground
and defied the worst blow of the season.
The cars of the San Francisco and San
Mateo Electric Railway were tied up for
some hours last night. The current rave
out early in the evening and traffic on
the entire system came to an immediatÂ»
standstill. The cause was supposed to be
broken wires somewhere on the system.
T.p to a late hour the break had not
been located.
Charles Banner and h!a wife, residing
at 919 Davis street, had a narrow escape
from serious Injury during the storm last
night. The couplo had retired for the
night when suddenly a heavy rust of
wind struck the building, shaking It to
the foundations. A heavy chimney was
toppled over and crashed through the
roof and ceiling Into tho bedroom of
Banner and his wife. Although the fall

they fortunately escaped with a few

agreed upon, thus making Auguln furnl'h
iÂ».iil to the extent of $150. Blufnenborg $150
s.rxl Clapp $123. .After they had put up
tLe necessary ball they were released.
li is understood they will majse no at
tempt to tight the cases, but will allow
ihpir bail to go by default.
Chief Sullivan intends to sÂ«e that all
the. owners of immoral houses are forced

as the Chinese gamblers.
â¢ "In my opinion they should be made to
swell the city funds just like the Chinese
;>re doing," the Chief remarked shortly
nfter the three men had been arrested.
'They are eatigfied with the arrangement
end pÂ«*em to think that it is the proper

happy In the choice she had made. An
hour after the marriage a dispatch came
to the pretty bride announcing that she
was no longer considered to be a member
of the Mackinnon family. Further, she
was informed that her clothing had been
shipped to an express office.
Mr. and Mrs. de I^ancey returned home
to-day. The groom met his father-in-law,
but there was nothing more than a re
newal by Mackinnon of his decision
against- the young people.
De Lancey Is a son of John de Lancey,
a well-to-do merchant of this city, resid
ing at 724 Twenty-first street, and has
been for several years a clerk Jn the law
offices of Crowell & Leach. He is about
the same age as his bride. The young
man begins his wedded life with the bene
dictions of his parents, who have assured
him of their approval of his course.
He is to reside at Sacramento during
the Legislature's session, where he will
hold a position. Of his marriage he said:
"All I desire to say is that Mr. Mackin
non refuses to recognize his daughter or
myself. We are of age and fully under
stand what we have done."
Mr. Mackinnon said to-night: "The mat
ter of my daughter's marriage to Mr. de
Lancey I consider a personal affair and
I do not care to discuss it. If Mr. de
Laneey says I refused to give my consent
to the marriage. I have only to say that
he ought to know."
N0 NECESSITY FOR
IMPROVEMENT
Colonel Heuer.
Adverse Report in San Joa
quin Canal Matter by
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N
W.; WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.-General Wil
son, chief of engineers, to-day sent; to
Congress the reports of Lieutenant Col
onel Heuer upon the preliminary examin
ation and survey, with a view to the im
provement of the San Joaquin River and
the waterways connecting the stream
with the strait of Carquinez from the
town of Antioch to Suisun Point.
Colonel Heuer finds the existing depths
in the bay ample for the commerce now
using the waterway and likely to use It
lor several years to come, and declares
the proposed improvement, in his opinion
unnecessary.
The report of Colonel Heuer upnn the im
provement of Oakland harbor, also sent
to Congress, contains the following esti
mates of the cost of the project: Canal
wide and 20 feet deep, from San
r : rancisco Bay to Fallon street. Oakland,
thence 3U0 feet wide and 17 deep to tidal
basin, thence 300 by 12 around the tidal
basin $W6.293; 500 by 25 from San Fran
cisco Bay to Fallon street, thence m ud
and around the tidal basin. |1,6S7,818: 500
by 25 from San Francisco Bay to Chest
nut street. thence 300 by 25 on
tallon street, thence 300 by 17
feet to tidal basin, thence 300 by 12 feet
around tidal basin, $08,203.
Each of the foregoing Hems includes the
estimate for an extension south of Jettv
5jO feet west, J53.9Q0. %
The young man, learning of the oppo
sition, announced his willingnes to with
draw. Ho asr.eed to forget for three
years that he had ever known Miss Mac
kinnon. Then if the old sentiment had
not changed he should wed the girl of his
choice. That proposition was not ac
ceptable to Mackinnon, who continued in
his attempt to exact a promise from the
girl that she would cast off De Lancey
for all time. She would not consent to
the proposition.
The climax was reached New Year's
eve. With the near advent of the new
century Mackinnon again and for the last
time renewed his demand, coupled with
the threat that he would cast out his ob
durate child if she should persist in her
attitude toward her admirer.
There was a scene at home, a meeting
with her sweetheart and a. final decision
to act at once. Arrangements for the
wedding that night were quickly made.
De Lancey laid the situation before his
parents and they stood by the young
man. Friends In San Francisco of" Miss
Mackinnon were enlisted, and the wed
ding party, composed of the bride and her
lover. Ansell Jones and Clinton de Lan
cey and Rev. Paul M. Spencer, assistant
pastor of the First MethodiFt Church ot'
this city, went across the bay. At mid
night to a second the ceremony was cele
hrated. Isabeile Mackinnon was a wife
and a disowned daughter, but she was

WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â Georr* B.
Roberts, the Director of the Mint, to-day
made public his preliminary estimate of
the production of gold and silver In. the
United States during the calendar year
1900. The aggregate of gold is given aa
3,837,218 fine ounces, valued at J79.S22.2S1,
and ot silver 69,630,543 fine ounces, which,
at the approximate average price of 61
cents for the year, makes the value $36,
362.431.
During the calendar year 1899 the gold
production was $71,063,400 and thÂ« silver
production 64,781,500 fine ounces. ' The
Nome gold and silver production for 1900
was given as $5,100,000 and that 'of the
Klondike, which Includes both the Amer
ican and Canadian fields, $22,287,656. The
product of the Canadian mines Is -not in
cluded in the figures given, but aa the
gold and silver comes to the American
mints, the value Is given separately.
' The following In the production by
States and Territories in gold value and
in silver fine ounces: '
Director of the Mint Gives
Estimates of the Pro
duction.

List Both in Gold and Silver,

GOLD OUTPUT
OF PAST YEAR
who performed the autopsy on the re
mains of Captain Stendell of the sloop
Lulu, admitted to-day that the evidence
of murder was only speculative. Marks of
blows were found on the skull, but the
body was so badly decomposed that no
decided opinion could be given.
. Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County,
who Is Investigating the case, thinks that
Stendell was 'lead before falling Into the
water. The Sheriff said yesterday: "I am
of the opinion that the Lulu's skipper was
murdered by companion pirates with
whom he had quarreled over plunder. Ac
cording to my theory, he was prowling
about under the wharves; at Point Rich
mond In the email, boat that la missing.
and was thrown from that and not from
the deck of the sloop. I have been mak
ing Inquiries along the water front of
Oakland arid San Francisco, and. have
found traces of Stendell. Three days be
fore he disappeared "at Point Richmond
he crossed from San Francisco to Oak Â¦
land and tied up at Broadway wharf. He
was accompanied by another sloop, and
evidently the owners quarreled over plun
der, for a 300-foot hawser was found on
the wharf next morning cut to pieces.
Stendell then went to Point Richmond
and anchored off the Santa Fe slip, near
another sloop, ort which were two men.
The night after their arrival Watchman
O'Brien heard cries, evidently coming
from under the freight wharf.
"My theory Is this: Stendell and the two
men from the other vessel rowed under
the freight wharf In search of plunder,
and while there quarreled, and Stendell
was struck on the head and thrown in the
bay. His skiff Â¦was found floating about
the next day. Stendell was a powerful
swimmer and could easily have saved
himself unless stunned before striking the
water."
The funeral of the dead skipper was
held this afternoon from undertaking par
lors In Berkeley.

A Cargo for Mexico.
The storm did considerable damage to
the wires of the railroad companies.
Trouble began to be experienced at about
4 o'clock yesterday afternpon, and there
were a number of stations which could
not be reached at all by telegraph the
balance of the afternoon.
Threatening weather was reported on all
the divisions early in the day. The ther
mometer in this city at 7 o'clock yester
day morning was 68, with the wind blow
ing in a southwesterly direction. At Sac
ramento at the same time the thermom
eter was 4H and the wind was in the south
east. It rained all day at Chlco. and at
Red Bluff 1.91 Inches fell during the day.
Many lines were reported snowed under.
The Oregon express, due at 8:45 a. m., and
No. 11, due at 7:45 last evening, were re
ported snowbound.
RAILROAD LINES
SUFFER DAMAGE
The Mission district afforded a good
opening for the effect of the wind while
it lasted. Telephone and electric wires
were twisted about each other to such a
degree that almost all of the telephone
lines were put out of business. During
the period in which these unpleasant com
binations were being made several slight
shocks were felt by persons who were at
the phones ready for business. The con
tact of electric lines crossing those of the
telephone silenced the phones completely
and In a good many instances deprived
stores and residences of their electric
light.
Advertising fences, as usual, went by
the wholesale from the ground upward,
only to land In a confused heap either on
the 6idewalks or into vacant lots. Zinc
and tin chimney tops were sent wind
ward In requiem to their last resting
places, sending cold shivers down the
backs of pedestrians who happened to be
In close proximity to their flight and land
ing places. .
Fortunately there were no personal In
juries reported at any of the hospitals
through the acts of the storm.
"HELLO" GIRLS
ARE SILENT
The steam schooner Mandalay had a
narrow escape at Hathaways wharf yes
terday. Owing to a strike .among the
men Wednesday she was not fully dis
charged and was lying alongside await
ing a chance to get away. A heavy swell
soon began to roll in and the captain or
dered steam up. In the . meantime the
waves forced the floor plankings out of
one of the warehouses and â¢ the Manda
lay began to chafe.- Finally she was got
away only to collide with the Steuart
street wharf. The Impact made â¢ the
structure tremble. Later. Chief Engineer
Holmes and Assistant Chief Ryan visited
the wharf and ' ordered every one off It.
The gates were then . closed and a notice
reading, "No admittance, . wharf I danger
ous," was posted on each gate.
â¢ The*Mandalay finally sought shelter in
Oakland Creek. ,
. Should the gale continue all - the city's
Improvements on the front will go. Â¦ At
noon yesterday twenty feet of the filling
in, done at the foot of Main street, had
.been-washed away and breaks were be
ginning in other places.
s The schooner S. T. Alexander and the
MANDALAY HAS
NARROW ESCAPE
The schooner j Occidental left Eureka
nineteen days ago and during all of that
time the- crew has never been away from
the pumps. She is now at San Pedro, but
the men have to keep pumping night and
day for fear she should sink at her moor
ings. In his report Captain RoBich says
that twice the schooner, nearly foundered,
owing to the break-down of tha pumps.
Soon after, leaving Â¦ Eureka the gala
came down on them and the Occidental
was at once In 'trouble. She began- to
leak, and then one of the pumps broke
down. An attempt was made to return
to Eureka, but It failed, so the schooner
had to run before It. On the fourth day
out the Occidental had four feet of: water
in her hold. From that on. things went
from bad to worse until San Pedro, was
reached. Captain Rosich . says S he ] will
have to beach the schooner in order to
find the leak before he can. get back to
San Francisco.
SCHOONER IS
NEARLY LOST
Captain Freeman took the big whale
back Titania to sea and is still aboard
her. She went out Wednesday afternoon
and hove to for a oilot-boat to come
alongside when off the lightship. No
small boat could live in the sea that was
running, so the Titania was put on her
course and Captain Freeman Is now well
on his way to Puget Sound. He will
come home overland and will probably
be on duty again next Monday.
The collier Czarina was to have sailed
for Seattle yesterday, but a breaking bar
and falling barometer caused Captain Sea
man to postpone his departure until to
day.
The mail steamer Alameda got away for
the colonies last night after the storm
had partially abated.
PILOT FRFEMAN
CARRIED TO SEA
The gale seems to be raging not only on
the. southern coast but all along the line
as far as Flattery.' The Gipsy reports a
gale blowing at Santa Cruz and the
schooner J. Eppinger went ashore at Fort
Ross and became a total loss.
The .Eppinger left here December 30, and
having a fair wind made a good run.
There Is no harbor at Fort Roes so the
vessels have to make fast to moorings and
the lumber and bark is sent out to them
in chutes. Wednesday afternoon the gale
came up, but it was an utter impossi
bility for the captain of the Eppinger to
beat out to sea. When the wind began
to whistle all the inhabitants of Fort Ros3
gathered on the beach and watched the
gallant little ex-sealer battle with tha
elements.- Soon the seas were breaking
all over the Eppinger, and when a rocket
from the shore carried a line aboard tho
captain and crew decided to abandon tha
vessel. A hawser was made fast to the
mainmast and then the other end was
sent ashore. When it had been made fast
the men left the vessel one after another.
Captain Jensen being the last to take to
the rope. At 8 p. m. tho Eppinger parted
her mooring lines one after the other ana
half an hour later she was a total wreck.
There ia a email wharf at Fort Ross,
but the lumber vessels never use It.
Neither will any other small craft from
this on until it is rebuilt. The wreckage
from the Eppinger completely demolished
it. The storm still continues up the coast
and the waves are rolling In mountain;*
high at Fort Ross. Old-timers report by
telephone that it is the worst storm ever
knpwn In that locality.
GOES ASHORE
AT FORT ROSS
&-â¢-oHERE was a scurry for cover yes-
I terday along the water fronU
I Shipmasters joined their vessels
11 in a hurry and many a perilous
voyage had the boatman to make
in order to get the captains aboard. All
steamers and wind-jammers along the
southerly part* of the front got out extra
mooring lines and some of them procured
bales of hay to act as fenders.
Wednesday it blew even harder than it
did yesterday, but then the barometer
stood at S0.14 while yesterday it was down
to 29.W and still falling. Again there
came a dispatch from i'ort Harford say
ing a terrific southeaster was raging
there and traveling northward. This all
tended to make the snlpmasters careful
and every one of them took extra precau
tions to protect their ships.
At 6 p. m. the barometer was 29.83 ana
still falling.
The steamship Alameda sailed yesterday for
Sydney and way ports with a general cargo

grreat that a general wreck might fol
low. The owners of the two vessels are
furious, as they want to use their vessels
at once.
The collier Willamette was to have
docked at Beale street yesterday, but the
British ship Austrasla held the fort. The
captain of the latter vessel would gladly
have gone into the stream, but the tug
boats would not take him until the gale
is over. ' â¢ '

STORM BREAKS
UPON OAKLAND
YREKA, Jan. 3.â Harry Smith, one of
the most favorably known young men in
this, place, perished from exhaustion and
exposure In the Humbug Mountains last
night within sight of his . home. He and
his father work at the Spangler mine,
twelve miles distant, and when the storm
eet in he started for home to look after
the property. His mother was alone, his
only brother having left a few days since
for San Francisco on *ils bridal trip.
Young Smith was a strong and powerfully
built man, but the snow piling up deeper
and deeper exhausted his vitality during
the many hours he struggled In his efforts
to reach his mother and home. The Red
Men's lodge, of which he was a member,
sent out four men on > horseback to at
tempt to recover the body and bring it
Into town.
PERISHES IN
SIGHT OF HOME
YREKA, Jan. 3.â The snowstorm of the
last forty-eight hours has passed all pre
vious records, seventy-two Inches having
fallen since Tuesday evening and It ia
still snowing furiously. Buildings are fall
ing in under the tremendous weight and
every person in town that is able to
handle a shovel. Including many profes
sional men and merchants, is working
night and day cleaning -snow from house
tops, and the demand for shovelers has
been so great that $2 aa hour Is being
paid.
North and south bound trains, engines
and snowplows are snowed In at different
places in the county on the line of the
railroad.
The Fort Jones and Etna stage has been
since yesterday morning trying to come a
distance of eighteen miles and it Is feared
that It is helpless In the Scott Valley
Mountains. - To-morrow the stage com
pany intends driving twenty-five head of
horses across the ' mountain in the at
tempt to open the road.
Two engines hauling a single car left
here for Montague yesterday and have
been unable to return. <
Two hundred and twenty-five excursion
ists from this county and as many more
from Southern Oregon and other points
are in San Francisco unable to return on
account of the blockade.
TONS OF SNOW
BLOCK ROADS
ASHLAICD, Or., Jan. 3.â The unprece
dented snowstorm which began January 1
has been raging all day throughout the
Slsklyou Mountains, Northern California
and the canyon of the Sacramento with
unabated fury. At Ashland and the lower
levels It has been raining, with snow at
intervals. The railroad situation on the
Southern Pacific Is not as hopeful as It
appeared last night, and a blockade exists
at Castella, seven miles below Dunsmulr,
on the Sacramento division. Two local
passenger trains. No. 12 and the Oregon
express. No. 16, are south of that point,
unable to get through. South-bound pas
senger trains Nos. 15 and 11, which left
Ashland yesterday, have run as far as
Dunsmulr, where they are held. No. 15,
which left Ashland at noon hauled by
eight engines, had only proceeded as far
as Slskiyou, seventeen miles, up to 10
o'clock to-night. No. 11, due here at mid
night, will be held at Ashland. Manager
Koehler, Superintendent Fields and Resi
dent Engineer Grohndall of the Southern
Pacific are at Dunsmulr.
No freight trains are sent south of Ash
land. At 10 o'clock to-night the snow lies
all over Northern California and the Sls
klyous from one to two feet deeper than
the previous record breaking year of 1889
90. There Is eleven feet of snow on the
level at the railway crossing of the Siskl
yous, six feet at Yreka, six feet at Sisson
and nine feet at Dunsmuir. The wind la
blowing hard and the snow drifting badly
on the south side of the Slskiyous, while
it is wet and heavy on the north side.
TRAFFIC TIED
UP IN OREGON
RENO, Jan. S. â Reno was visited last
night and to-day by one of the most se
vere windstorms ever experienced In this
vicinity. The wind attained a velocity of
something over sixty miles per hour and
the destruction of property will reach
into the thousands. Parry's livery stable,
one of the largest brick buildings in the
town was badly wrecked. Four persons
barely escaped with their lives, two of
them being quite badly hurt by falling
brick and timbers. The Central Pacific
roundhouse was almost totally wrecked.
Dozens of large chimneys and smoke
stacks were toppled over. Telephone
wires and poles in all parts of the city
are down and business is virtually at a
standstill awaiting the cessation of the
storm. Fire alarms are of frequent oc
currence, but fortunately none of the
fires have as yet gained any headway.
Considerable damage was done to the
building of the State University. Plate
glass was smashed in some of the large
residences throughout the city. The storm
Is general throughout this section and as
far east as Western Utah.
A report htts just reached here that the
Nevada. California and Oregon narrow
gauge passenger train, due here this even
ing at o p. in., has been blown from, the
track, fifty miles north of Reno, and sev
eral passengers hurt, one of whom.
Miss Dodge of Susanville. Is badly in
jured and will probably die. A wrecking
force has gone to the scene of the disas
ter.
The Virginia and Truckee passenger
train, bound'for Reno from Virginia City,
had a narrow escape from being wrecked
about twenty miles south of here. The
train, while going at full speed, was sud
denly brought to a full stop by the force
of the wind as the train was rounding a
curve and one of the trucks on the., bag
gage car left the rails Just as the train
came to a halt.
Rain is pouring down and no prospect
of cessation.
TRAIN IS BLOWN
FROM THE TRACK
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 3.â A terrific
' windstorm Is raging here to
night. Tin roofs have been car
ried away, fences and signs blown
down and much minor damage
done.
It Is reported that the steamer San Ra
fael, while docking at Sausallto. was car
ried broadside on against the piles. The
passengers at once became panic-stricken
and the efforts of cooler heads to pacify
them were futile. Screaming women and
children climbed over the side of the ves
sel and sprang to the wharf. Wires are
all down and full details of the accident
are lacking.
Two chimneys on the "Wllkins building
In this city were blown down and crashed
through the roof, wrecking the upper floor
of the building.
A rumor Is current here that a large
gum tree fell across a broad gauge freight
train, wrecking it. Owing to interrupted
telegraphic and telephonic communica
tion It Is impossible to verify the story.
A number of yachts and arks are an
chored in the bay.' All have suffered se
verely, and It Is feared that some will go
down. The full extent of the damage
cannot be estimated.
"The wind is southeast and Is blowing
about forty miles an hour. The storm
is quite general over the coast, and will
prcbably move slightly southward. South
ern California will probably get a little
rain. At 6 o'clock this morning It was
raining at Fresno. There has been a very
heavy rainfall In the upper part of the
Sacramento Valley.
'"At Red Bluff during the last twenty
four hours there has been a rainfall of
2.44 of an inch. The river at that town is
rapidly rising. At 5 o'clock to-night the
16-foot mark had been reached. The dan
ger line is twenty-five feet. That the
river is rising rapidly is apparent from
the fact that it has risen 12 feet in the
last twenty-four hours. There is a good
deal of wind with the storm in the moun
tains. At Carson and Wlnnemucca it is
blowing f2 miles an hour.
"San Francisco will have more rain to
morrow. The wind has been blowing over
the Mills building at the rate of 3S miles
cji hour. I expect it will decrease ic velo
city before morning."
"Weather Observer Alexander G. McAdle,
in discussing the condition of the weather
last night, made the following official
the derrick, loose planks, live wires and
everything movable was hurled across the
track or down into the basement of the
building. Linemen were summoned and a
force of men was sent out by the Market
Street Railway Company to clear the
track. Until the wires were cut they could
do little, as the tangled mass of wires ly
ing acros the track, moved by the wind,
emitted warning flashes and â¢ made quite
an electrical display. On top of this,
while a crowd was gazing at the debris
covered street, the bi" advertising fence
adjoining the building at 14 McAllister
street blew down, narrowly missing one
of the cars on the south track. This
fence, which is a menace to people walk
ing along McAllister street. wa9 originally
twenty-five feet high, but as it haa blown
down at almost every gale of wind prop
erty owners in the vicinity have objected
to it remaining at that height. They will
probably take means to prevent its being
rebuilt.
An old fence in the rear of 351 McAl
lister street and fronting on Ash avenue,
the property of Joseph Wores, early went
down on the street, blocking traffic. The
supports were pulled completely out of
the ground.
ENTIRE STATE
STORM SWEPT
of fruit. With ample rain the trees will
be In excellent condition for the spring
blossoming, which now will not come un
til there has been moisture to supply the
trees and vines. During the gale this
morning the anemometer on the High
School building. was wrecked.
The bay wa3 foamy and so rough that
the creek boat Newark was withdrawn
from regular service. The steamer had a
very hard trip to San Francisco at 8
o'clock this morning.
The freight boat Mount Eden started
from Oakland about the same hour, but
was turned back because of rough water.
TWO VESSELS
IN COLLISION
Shortly after 8 o'clock and while thÂ»
wind was blowing its hardest the Ameri
can bark Theobald and the British bark
Invermark crashed together In the stream
below Harrison-street wharf. Distress
signals were fired from one of the vessels
and a few moments later the tug's Re
lief, Monarch and Reliance were engaged
In separating the ships. In lesa than aa
hourboth had been towed to a safe an
chorage and extra mud hooks werÂ© put
out to insure aralnst drifting about in
me storm.
The Invermark lost her Jlbbooci and
?^ Tt rJ^ her bowsprit In the collision, and
tne Theobald suffered to the extent Of a
sprung mainmast. The Theobald Is a
wooden vessel and has a full load of lum
ber. The Invermark Is of Iron and Is
loaded with wheat for Europe.
The extent of the Theobald's damage
cannot be estimated until her carro haa
been unloaded. When the tugs left her
she had a bad list to starboard and there
is a chance that she might be badly dam
aged below the water line.
FERRY BOATS
ARE STOPPED
Passengers on the 8:30 o'clock narrow
gauge boat to Oakland last nl*ht were
given a ride across the bay and then,
brought back to this oldÂ© to await the
pleasure of the gale. When the steamer
reached Alameda mole thÂ© wind was
shifting in all directions and making such,
a choppy sea at the slip that tha captain
put about and headed for San Francisco,
deeming It unsafe to attempt a landing
at the other side. The passengers were
transferred to the broad-gauge boat.
The Stockton River boats were detained
for some little time waiting for the rale
to moderate. Most of the passengers
were more than anxious to avoid crossing
the upper bay during the blow Â°M tha
detention caused few protests.
BATTLESHIP
GOES ADRIFT
Reports were current last niÂ»ht that
the big: battleship "Wisconsin drifted from
her moorings at the Union Iron Works
and was Been off Hunters Point In dan
ger of being driven ashore. Captain
Sllovich of the tug Relief say* he taw
the big fighting machine oft Hunters
Point Jbut apparently In no serious dan
ger, when the storm waned the diffi
culty of holding the ship steady was
not great, and she had doobtlesa found
secure anchorage.
For the second time since Its construo
tion was begun the building of thÂ« Cal
laghan Estate Company at thÂ» Junction
of Market and McAllister streets has
been damaged by storm. During a. pre
vious high wind some of the stores werÂ©
blown from the walls. Last nlgnt about
& o'clock a gust of wind more severe than
others caused the derrick on the uncom
pleted fourth story of the building to vio
lently sway. The guy ropes were attached
to a number of poles in the vicinity, one
cf which was at the Jones and McAllister
streets end of the building. This, bearing
a large number of live wires, was broken
End hurled across the street. Two women
Â¦were passing at the moment and Frank
Ralph, night watchman of the Hibernia
Bank, was standing in front of the main
entrance of the bank.
"Just as the women passed," said Ralph,
"an iron bolt in the crosspole that fell
across the Etreet struck the mackintosh of
ore of them. There was a flash of light
and a blaze, and then I grabbed the gar
ment off her. The other woman, who was
a few feet ahead of her, was carrying an
umbrella. The wire struck some portion
of the framework and bright flashes were
visible. She screamed dropped her um
brella and ran before I had a chance to
go to her assistance."
Following the fall of the first pole other
ropes parted, and pieces of the rigging of
A heavy cornice wn.s blown from the top
of a four-story buiidlng on the north
west corner of Kearny and Sacramento
streets and crashed down upon the pave
ment. The falling debris narrowly. missed
killing several pedestrians. As the tim
bers descended they caused a number of
electnc lignt and telegraph wires to snap
and the police were obliged to warn pe
destrians ot the presence of live wires
for several hours following. The electric
Ught company was i;otifle3. but failed to
eer.d a lineman to repair the damage.
At Powell and Sacramento streets two
large trees were blown over and lay
across the street. The cars were blocked
Ja consequence for several houre. A.
lerge sign fell at Post and Powell streets
and fences at Sacramento and Jones
street* were blown down and the wreck
age interrupted traftlc In the street
While Captaan Comstock of the under
writers" Fire Patroi was returning from
an alarm for a small blaze at Butter and
Jones streets his buggy was capsized by
the force of the wind and he was thrown
into the street. The fireman was not in
jured and the buggy was not damaged to
any great extent.
A rumor was circulated, which caused
some commotion, that the wind had badly
wrecked the Cliff House. It was found,
however, that only a few windows haa
been broken in the west side of the struc
ture. Near the life-saving station a num
ber of fences went to the ground.
Six large wine casks that stood on a
sidewalk near Montgomery avenue and
1'allejo etrett rolled into the street and
traveled some distance before they were
stopped. One of them crashed through a
large plate-glass window In a drugstore
near Pacific street.

Sail Francisco for the second time this winter yesterday felt the full fury of the Storm King. Early in the morning the wind blew with steady force, increasing in volume each hour. In the afternoon the rain descended
in volumes and during the evening the city and bay were swept by a miniature tornado. Considerable damage was done to property, but fortunately no loss of life was" reported. On the bay and ocean the water was churned into
high waves. Early precautions by shipping men prevented serious injury to vessels. During the evening fences, signs, trees and electric light wires and poles were leveled to the ground. A house in the Mission collapsed, and by
the fall of a derrick from the building in course of erection at McAllister and Market streets the cable cars on the former street were blocked for many hours. At midnight the Storm decreased.
