This last statement of the witness
caused a sensation in the room.
Secretary Kane of Society for Preven-
tion of Vice Gives Important
Testimony.
Secretary Frank Kane of the Society
for the Prevention of Vice was then
called upon to testify. He stated that he
had been engaged in the rescue work of
slave girls for the past seven years. He
testified that he had made many arrests
and rescues in that time. ' .
"I had no difficulty to get In the broth
els. I showed my star and the doors were
opened. I have always found that the
white watchmen of the brothels would
give the alarm when I approached. I
know a man named'Flnn. tie looks after
the brothels. 1 always see him when I
go' to rescue a girl. When I, have gone
with the ladlea of the mission to rescue
some of the slave "girls Finn has run
ahead off us and given them the alarm;
When we would get in the houses the
girls would not be there."
(Finn is the man who testified that in
ten years' experience in Chinatown as a
special; watchman he did not- know of a
house of ill fame in the ; quarter. Finn
was placed on the witness â¢ stand at the
request of Attorney Dunne, representing
the Folice Department.) Â« "-
Continuing, Secretary Kane said: "I
saw Flnnlast night on Dupont street He
said to me that there were lots of.whlto
slaves- (or me to : rescue. ' and wanted to
know why- 1 was after: the Chinese slave,
girls. < He said." 'I . suppose ?Â¦ there is lots
of money in it for you.' I retorted by
saying to him thathe made lots of money
out of the Chinese slave girls he, watched.
He: made . no answer 'â¢ to ' that.- When: I
went into Barrett, alley : last ; night ;Flnn
followed me and gave the alarm in. Chi

them all closed." , ' â¢â¢ - : Â¦ ' ' -.--.Â«*: :
"Have you heard of a' fund for securing
innnunltv from arrest- for the houso3 of
ill fame'" " .. #?r ,--..-,
"The Chinese told me they paid for pro-'
vious witnesses as being one of the com
mittee appointed by the gamblera to ralso
a fund for the corruption of the police.)
"Do you mean to say that you have
never been in a club in Chinatown?"
"Never."
"Be careful what you say. Will you
swear you have never been In one of these
clubs?" -. . â¢Â¦-'Â¦-
"I will."
"Have you ever seen a game of fantap
played?"
"No, I have never seen the game."
"Will you swear that?"
"The trend of my life is not in that di
rection. I am not religious, but I attend
to my own business."
The palpable perjury of the witness was
apparent when he further stated that he
had- not been in a lottery place in China
town or seen Chinese lottery played. Hi*
reputation /is that he Is one of the princi
pal owners of the lottery games played In
Chinatown.
"Do you know that you will get Into
trouble if you commit perjury?"
"Yes."
"You will swear that In all your life you
have never seen a game of fantan or lot
tery played?"
"1 will state so positively."
The witness stated that he did not know
Watchman Finn or any of the police by
name.
"There are so many police it is difficult
to learn their names. I have heard of Ser
geant Brophy, but I don't know him. The
Chinese say that Brophy was very actlvo
In breaking up the gambling and lottery
dens."
The Chinese known as "Buck-eye" was
then called to the stand and his evidence
was as worthless as that of San Jose
Charlie. Buck-eye also has the reputation
of being a principal in conducting fantan
and lottery games in Chinatown, but he
would admit nothing. He stated that he
knew of the existence of the "clubs," but
that he seldom went to them. * -
"If I go there it is because I can speak
English and the members of the clubs
want me to act as Interpreter for them so
that they can speak to the gas men.
plumbers and painters who do work for
the clubs."
"Do you know of Chinese raising
money?" .'-' '. .-Â¦
"What money and what for"?
"Do you know of money being raised
for securing immunity?"
"No, certainly not..'
"Did you collect any money for that
purpose?"
"I collected money three years ago for
the purpose of defending some men ar
rested on the charge of gambling."
"How much?"
"About $300." ' Â¦ j
"Was that money collected for any
ether purpose?"
"To whom was that money paid?"
"To Joe Coffey and Colonel Smith.
The witness then repeated the familiar
story of the many doors which exist in
' the gambling places, although he deslg
r ated them as "clubs." W hen asked why
the lookout did not open the doors when
the police desired to enter tha clubrooms
the witness in an Impudent manner said:
"I don't know. I don't sit alongside the
men to find out what they do."
Attorney Joseph Coffey then took the
v.-ltnes9 chair and in reply to questions
by Judge Laird said that he had acted
for the Chinese for many years, but Had
never acted as attorney for the Chief of
Police. "I was never offered money by
white men or Chinese to 'secure for the
Chinese gamblers or lottery men im
munity from arrest. In tho past two
>ears I have only appeared in three Chi
nese cases. I have represented Chinese
gamblers In the courts at tho request of
San Jose Charlie, Buck-Eye. Chan Chung
and Wong Fook. I never conferred with
the police on behalf of the men I have
mentioned.
"Have you jever played fantan or pl
gow?"
"Yes, I learned the games some years
ngo in order that I might intelligently
defend Chinese charged with playing
these games."
"Did the Chinese offer you $4S00 if you
â¢ could secure the* reopening of the down
btairs 'clubs'?"
'"No, never."
"Was any offer ever made to you?
"A Chinese called at my office recent
ly and told me that I could make that

Police Sergeant Helms was then called
and testified that he had made raids on
houses of ill-fame in which Japanese girls
were kept. He denied the statement made
bv Secretary Kane of the Society for the
Prevention of Vice that he. the witness,
had refused to raid a certain house be
cause he was afraid to do bo.
"The interpreter for Kane told me ef
the house on Dupont street and said it
was a house of Ill-fame. I told him that
I had no evidence against It and even it

.no Instructions to do so. "It was In a

"Who told you that?"
"Must I give the name."
"We would like to have it."
"To give the name of the Chinese who
told me that would mean his murder."'
Secretary Kane then saldr "My opinion
Is that the slaves are protected by the
police. They, the girls and their owner*
are lnfornuii qf all things that occur In
the courts. If a warrant is issued the
Chinese know of it at once. If a raid is
planned It Is the same thing. The police
are not zeaious. They always fln:i fault
with tha ago of the girl we want to se
cure. Thev always say she is over, agu
and should not be taken out of the

white watchmen of the slave dens, and
they should not be allowed to exist.".
"Are they very friendly?"
"Very friendly." , . â¢
"Have you any proof outside of what
you have stated?"
"Nothing positive."
Secretary Kane was then excused, but
he stated to the committee that he de
sired to make a statement. He was given
permission to do so and created a sensa
tion by saying: "
â¢"The committee has not .touched at all
on the question of Japanese slavery
which exists in this city. For two years
I have tried to break up the traffic in
Japanese " girls. Many of them are
minors. \ During the crusade made by
Sergeant .Helms against the Japanese
houses of ill fame the house at 512 Dupont
street was not molested. This house, was
the worst of all. Sergeant Helms told
me that he was afraid to touch It. Some
time later, when I was prosecuting the
case of Yakota, who was charged with
the importation of a girl for Immoral pur
poses, lny interpreter was arrested and
charged- with blackmail. The police put
up a Job to have him arrested and
charged with blackmail. It is. strange
that 512 Dupont street was overlooked in
the crusade by Sergeant Helms and other
places were raided. I know that Captain
Wittman went to that house to hide and
put up a job on me, and I' am sorry he
is not here to hear what I say."
Captain Wittman, who was In the court
room, said, "I am here and listening, Sec

"Because . he was > very strict and they
wanted him out of Chinatown."
"Did you do anything In the matter?"
"DoeB not the dealer of the fantan game

The witness gave no answer. When the
question was repeated the witness said:
"How can I tellâ I never saw the game
played."
The witness refused to state If he .had
Been a hopper in his clubrooms - which
led down to the sewer. He had seen
buckets of water in the rooms, but did
not know what they were used for. (The
evidence of the police shows that the hop
pers are used for destroying: the evidence
In the fantan games, and the water is for
the purpose of washing the materials
into the sewer.) â¢
The witness pleaded ignorance of any
knowledge of money being paid- for the
privilege of running. the gambling games.
"Who is there to pay money to, and
who would not take money if it was of
fered to him?"
"Did you ever pay any money to any
one in order to be allowed to run a fan
tan game?"
"I never paid money for that to any

The witness then stated that there were
many gambling places in Chinatownâpos
sibly more than a hundred,
"How many lottery places?"
"Thirty to forty."
"How many fantan places?"
"About seventy."

"When the members of the club hold a

The witness was then askod as to th9
nature of the tables in the dubs he owned
and he gave a number of evasive answers.
He finally stated that tho tables were
square ones and were- covered with white
and black cloth. The witness would' not
admit that the clubrooms had a tablo
with a set of drawers in which money
was kept. He admitted that he had a safe

-^ \ v HE NEVER SAW FANTAN
Childlike and Bland He Answers in
After being plied with a series "of ques
tions the witness admitted that- his dubs
had three or four doors, which were made
of thick oak and were protected with
spring locks of the best make:- He also
stated that the Â¦ glass doors were covered
with wire netting to ' '.'prevent the glass
being broken." He then was compelled
"Certainly not.".
The witness then explained that he had
hoard that the gambling places had been
compelled to move from the ground floor
to the floor above, but he did not know
the reason why this, was done. He had
been sick at the time and his partners
had told him of the moving: of the clubs
he. the witness.' was Interested In. When
asked as to the use his clubs were put to
ar.d the furniture In them the witness
gave a series of diplomatic answers which
threw little light on the Investigation. He
told of costly furniture. Idols and engrav
ings on the walls, ebony chairs and tables,
but evaded the line of questions put to
him. When asked to what use the tables
were put the witness answered by saying
the tables were used . to place meals on.
When pressed for an answer the witness
admitted that 'the tables were used; for
dominoes, poker and perhaps fantan.
"Did you ever see fantan played In your
club?"
Chan Chung testified, through Or. Gard
ner, the interpreter, that he lived at 602
Jackson street and had lived in this city
for twenty-six years. He stated that he
was a merchant and owned the lease of
the Chinese Theater and had a partner's
interest in various clubs.
In reply to questions by Chairman
Knowland Chan . Chung said;* "I have
never played fantan. These clubs are for
social purposes. My friends meet thero
and talk. I have never seen fantan played
in my clubs or In any other clubs. I do

in Ross alley, near Jackson street."
"Are these clubs gambling places?" '
"Oh, no."
"Are you" Interested in any Chinese
houses of 111 fame?"
Chan Chung is an individual of greasy
and massive proportions, and even the
committee of investigation was forced to
laugh at the testimony of the Chinese.
If Chan Chung's evidence is to bo "be
lieved, Chinatown is as clean as the
Augean stables after Hercules finished his
work.
The first witness called was Chan
Chung, whom previous testimony had
placed in the category of gamblers who
had raised money to bribe the police.

tion of the legislative committee was pro
ductive of important testimony, and the
crowded courtroom listened with rapt at
tention to the proceedings.

CHINESE DENY
GAMBLING EXISTS
Frank Kane, secretary of the Pacific
Coast Society for the Suppression of Vice,
was also a witness and made serious alle
gations against Chief Sullivan, Captain
Wittman and other officers in connection
with Japanese offenders. Chief Sullivan
attempted to' reply In kind, but was pre
vented at a critical moment. The whole
inquiry had lost the dignity of an impar
tial investigation and had degenerated
into the nastiness of petty retaliation. -
when he sees It. One of the others, Chun
Chung by name, was an artist in perjury.
Diplomatic, suave, bland, consciously con
temptuous, he afforded a diversion that
would have been amusing if it had not
been serious. He was cleverer and wittier
than his questioners and left the stand
easily the master of the situation. He
announced that the Chinese collected a
fund of $10,000 with which to secure the re
moval of Sergeant Price from Chinatown.
When asked who received the money he
declared significantly that any one curious
enough to inquire might refer to the rec
ords, learn who were the opponents of
Price and be assured that the men who
received the money .were not far away.
The record Is so fresh in the public mind
that it is hardly necessary to tell who
were the opponents of Sergeant- Price.
This episode was practically a climax lo
a disagreeable day. For hours the com
mittee listened to perjury of the most
shameless, offensive character, while the
courtroom was convulsed in laughter,
l-'our notorious Chinese gamblers were on
the witness stand and only one of them
would admit that he knows a fantan game
This was the statement Cram related to
the police on Monday night. Then he was
permitted to go no one knows where, but
he svrore that for several days he had
been looking for the Examiner agent to
pet his money. He returned to the Hall
of Justice yesterday morning and was de
tained there until he went upon the wit
ness stand. Then, fn great agitation, he
swore that he had deliberately and ma
liciously lied to the police. In disgust the
committee dismissed hjm from the court
room, and Examiner agents in triumph
ushered him away. The whole affair had
simply been an exhibition of cheap sharp
practice, in which the Examiner had
proved itself in. that particular field more
cunning than the police.
He had usurped one of the most im
portant powers of the committee, and
took a reprimand with a composure which
might have been expected. It then devel
oped that on Monday night Cram had
made a statement to Chief of Police Sulli
van, Captain Wittman, Detective Wren
and Attorney Coffey and had declared
that the fantan game was simply a chea.i
tr.ck inspired and carried out by the Ex
aminer to impose upon Assemblyman
Wright. The Examiner had paid Cram
to arrangÂ« the game, secure a crowd of
Chinese loafers to pose as players and to
Impress Wright v.-ith the wickedness of
it all. For thi3 Cram was to receive $400
from the Examiner and "Wright was to
fce permitted to win the few dollars he
took away.
An excited, trembling, stammering, con
fused young feliow was led into the court
room and in a few minutes was hustled to
the witness stand. He said his name was
Charles S. Cram, and that on the nig.it
before he had been Aibpenaed to attend
the session of the committee. The Assem
blymen were dumfounded. They had issued
no subpena and naturally wanted to know
who had done to. Captafn AVittman was
accused and was quick to deny the'accu
pation. Attorney Coffey then admitted
that he had assumed the responsibility.
In matter-of-fact contempt of the opin
ions of the committee, he declared that e
had Â¦written on a Eubpena issued to him
the name of Cram.
The promise was net kept and yesterday
Joseph Dunne, who seems to have a fac
ulty of doing the wrong thing at the
right time, asked for the white mystery.
The Examiner representative said he
could not find him. whereupon Dunne
melodramatically announced that he
would produce the missing wonder within
three minute?. ' He did so and that pro
duced the sensation.
THE promised sensation in the
legislative Inquiry ir.to the af
fairs' of the Police Depart
ment has been give'n to the .
public, und while it was de
veloped from a distinctively
minor episode in the investi
gation it has served to reveal the motive
of the -whole affair and to expose the limit
to which the special prosecutor In the case
trill go to win a point. The Investigation
has <>serieratcd simply into a viciously
â¢vindictive attack upon the Police Depart
ment by the Examiner, which has not
f crupled to resort to questionable methods
to throw discredit upon its adversary.
The lncldcrlt out of which the sensation
was evolved was a simple pse. A fe\y
nights ago Assemblyman Wright, guided
by an Examiner lgent, was led into
Chinatown, introduced to a mysterious
â¢white man and initiated into a far.tan
gamp at *<">Â« rÂ»upcnt street. Assemblyman
Wright was duly proud of h'.s achieve
ment, noticeably boastful of a winning of
a few dollar? and painfully pelf-conscious
of the notoriety th^t was his. The Ex
aminer was joyful and the police sus
picious. Representatives of the depart
ment demanded the nan\e of the mysteri
ous white man who 2ed the Assemblyman
to the gamhling hause. Tho Examiner
agent would not give the name, but prom-'
lf-ed more. He said that he would produce
the unknown in court that day.

"Did you ever hear of a fund belns

"No, never.
At this Â« olnt of the investigation consid

nounce Â«* T Â»t made by Assemblyman Wright
that he d* 1 nt know the name of the

he. the As!Â»Â«.nblyman. was taken by Re

be made to do so now.
Reporter Boyle â I have searched for this
man in vain and cannot find htm.
Attorney Dunneâ If we produce this

Ser*geant Brophy left the courtroom and
returned In a few minutes with a sllm
looklng younsr man. who was put forward
by Attorney Dunne as the party referred
to as having introduced Assemblyman
Wright and Reporter Boyle into a Chinese
fantan game.
Every one in the courtroom looked for a
sensation, and the general opinion wa3
that a "Job by the Examiner" had been
foiled by the police. The young man took
the witness stand and was examined by
Chairman Knowland. He gave his name
as Charles Cram, and trembled visibly aa
he demanded an attorney before answer
ing any questions.
Â¦ "I was subpenaed last night." Cram
said, "and I won't answer any questions
until I know what my rights are. I want
to be protected."
Mr. Knowlandâ Who subpenaed you? I
issued no subpena.
Witness â I had a subpena read to me by
Detective Wren.
Mr. Knowlandâ I want an explanation
of this. Who has dared to issue a sub
pena for this committee without my con
sent?
At this point Attorney Coffey addressed
the committee and said: "I want to make
an explanation. "I was subpenaed last
night while I was in the Chief's office.
This man Cram was there, and I knew
that he was wanted before this commit
tee. As no subpena had been issued for
him I suggested, as a matter of precau
tion, that his name be inserted in the sub
pena for me and that it be read to him."
This statement caused a loud dissent
In the courtroom.
Chairman Knowlandâ I think. Mr. Cof
fey. that' your conduct Is most reprehen
sible in interfering with the privileges of
this committee. You had no right to do
such a thing. This witness was not
subpenaed by me.
Witness Cram herÂ© stated that the sub
pena was read to him in the presence of
Captain Wittman. Chief Sullivan, At
torney Coffey and Detective Wren.
Mr. Knowlandâ Did you sanction this.
Captain- Wittman? Did you sanction such
a proceeding as the insertion of this
man's name in a subpena Issued by this
committee for another party?
Captain Wittmanâ I did no wrong In
the matter. His name was inserted In
the subpena in the same way as is dona
In the courts. .
Judge Lairdâ I wish to say that when a
subpena is Issued it is legal for any one to
insert names other than the one original
ly written In.
This statement ended the excitement
which threatened at one time to end In
the arrest of some party by order of tho
committee.
Cram was then examined and his state
ment made to the police on Monday night,
which was in the hands of Mr. Know
lahd. was entirely repudiated by the wit
ness.
To the amazement of every one in the
courtroom Cram said: "I want to say
that the statement I made last night to
the police is false. The police took me
into the Chiefs office. . I knew I was a
witness for the Examiner. They had mo
In a hole. What could I do? The police
got at me and I was so scared that I did
anything to get away from them. They
did not threaten me, but kept on telling
me to tell the truth. Â»I saw the way the
police wanted a statement and I gave it
to them.. They put me In the sweatbox
and I did not tell them the truth. I lied
to them. Yes, I lied to them. I did not
known what to do. Coffey took down my
statement. He said he could prove that
I had been promised money by the Ex
aminer. I was in a hole and wanted to
get out and so I lied to them. I had been
looking for Boyle last night. I told Boyle
last week that if I Axed it so he and the
man of the committee could get -in a
fantan gamethat I would have to get out
of town." Â¦ ' . .
Cram made a rambling statement, and
to experienced eyes it was evident that
he was an "opium fiend" such as can be
found in Chinatown.

ner auestioned Cram as to the- words
which had been spoken when they first

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, .^WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY //13, . 1901.
THE legislative inquiry iuto the affairs of the PolicÂ© Depart
ment deg-snerated yesterday into a shameful farce. The in
vestlgators were made the objects of the laughing scorn of
a crowded courtroom for hours. Chinese witnesses were on
the stand and in practically open contempt of their questioners
committed palpable perjury. A white -witness swore to tell the
truth and a moment after confessed that he was a deliberate, con
scienceless liar, who a few hours before had lied to tha police. An
attorney appeared before the investigating commission and with
insulting assurance announced that he had trifled with the pro-
Cesses of the committee and had issued a subpena in their name.
Witnesses blackguarded on? another and when the day was over
only one important issue had been removed from the realm of con
troversy. :}-.-.'Â¦
Until yesterday it was a question of honest dispute whether
the inquiry is an impartial, unprejudiced, investigation of .the Po
lice Department by a committee from th- State Assembly or a
bitter, vindictive prosecution of the Police Department by the Ex
aminer. The proceedings yesterday demonstrated that the whole af
fair is an assault upon the Police Department inspired and directed
by the Examiner, which shares -with the police a position not to bÂ«
envied. . . Â¦"
"No."

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found

I said: "All right." * He took, me to a room,
and they followed, me. Â¦ Boyle suggested to
Wright ' to buy a ticket, which Wright did.
On a previous occasion that evening Boyle

minutes. Boyle won : at the Rams and pave

He played about twenty minutes. He won.
They let him win at the start. Boyle did not

make arrangements for him (Boyle) to get

I went to SOS Dupont street. I saw one of the
Chinamen that runs the club, and asked him
to fix up a game and I would bring up two
men to play who had lots of money. He said
he did not want to do It at first, but I talked
him into it. I told him one of the men was
an Examiner man named Boyle, and told him
I did not know who the other man was. I
said he would get well paid 'for the job. I'd
fix it; It would be all right. If we got ar

money to ball us out. I told him one of the

to have us balled out. The Chinaman said:

MENTO. Feb. 12.â The $150,000 miners' ap

cannot bring It back. It has been fought
persistently all through Its course In both
houses, the idea being that at all hazards
it should be kept from going to the Gov
ernor and compelling him to sign or veto.
The Governor has posed as the friend
of the measure from the start, and his
friends in both houses have been laboring
hard to defeat it, so that the Governor
would still have the credit of being Its
friend without adding its amount to the
expenditures of his administration.
The action of the Assembly Committee
on Mines yesterday stirred the friends
of the measure in the Senate to action,
and some very pretty parliamentary
work was done. It was Ralston's Inten

ate bill, should bo returned to the As

The bills, Xcs. K>S and *>J\ were a special
crdcr, but No. ZoS was under consideration
till 5:20 o'clock this afternoon without the
amendments proposed by the solicitous
Judiciary Committee being reached. Con
sideration of the measures will proceed
to-morrow under the head of unfinished
business. The contest against them will
1/e continued then, and after they have
jiassed to third reading The real struggle
v.-ill coir.e. The friends of the bills showed
a. strength of thirty-two votes to-day.
They claim the forty-or.e necessary to
ihial passage, but the suspicion of bluff
attaches to euch assertions. The fact re
mains that the Speaker's ruling was all ,
that saved them at least once to-day.
Thf- opponents of the measure forced
the haÂ»:d of the Governor's friends by
falling attention rcjjeatediy to the attempt
n;ade in the bills to encroach upon tho i
province of the Federal Â«iuarantine. The j
r< Â¦; iics ma-le to their arguments were]
worthy of ante-bellum days. State's |
rights were resurrected for the occasion.
When the Governor's bills, drafted for
him by Dr. Matthews of the Ptate Board
of Health and introduced for him, by
Speaker Pendieton. were first Fprutig on
*.hÂ«Â» Legislature, the. sole argument fcr
thÂ»Â»m was based on protection of San
i'rancis'-o's commercial interests".
Now that the business men have said
in- no uncertain tone that they do not
want a State quarantine trying to check
mate Federal quarantine, the argument
has been shifted to a new base. To-day
Johnson pleaded with tears In his eyes
for the protection of the health of the
renple of Oiliforr.la pprainst a plague that
doÂ»s not exist, even should it take the
last dollar in the treasury. He begged the
members from the interior to stand their

be. An<'. he asserted that the merchants
of San Francisco were aJways wrong, any
way, for "they pet their learning from

P.auer and Knight threw sops to their
consciences by the argument that the

Judiciary Committee. Collins of San
Francisco stood out against the measures
throughout the day in spite of appeals and
imprecations. He says his duty Is to his
C-.riFtltuems. not to the bosses.
Reebor of Sacramento bears the distlnc-
tlon of being the only Democrat who stood
in with the administration Republicans.
The contest opened with a motion by
Schleslnger that consideration of the
amendments offered by the Judiciary
Committee be postponed till to-morrow.
A battle royal followed. After-considera
ble debate the roll was called on Schles
inger's motion, and the vote was 34 to 24.
There was a call of the absentees and
then a call of the House. Twenty .were
absent, nine of them unexcused/ Ser
geants at arms scurried about and
brought In five In a bunch, then Hourl
gan by himself and finally Henry.
Hourigan was baited by members as he
stood at the bar of the Assembly. He
said he had been sick, but finally he be
came enraged at a request by Dunlap
that he speak up and give his excuse so
it could be heard. He shouted:
"I've beeen on a Junketing trip, that's
why. Youse don't think I'm afraid of
}ou, do youse? I defy the world."
Hourigan shook- his fist threateningly
at the world, and the Assembly excused
his- tardiness.
Johnson asked in dulcet tones for a
new rollcall, to avoid confusion .from
changes. Schleslnger and Sutro objected.
Sutro said Schlesinger's motion was al
ready carried. Speaker Pendleton took
umbrage at the statement, saying it was
a personal reflection on his rulings. An
derson of Solann said the rulings had
been fair and Sutro had not meant to
question them. Sutro said he had only
meant to give It as his opinion trom
keeping tab on the roll that the motion
Lad prevailed.
The speaker was molllfled, Schleslnger.
fell into Johnson's trap and withdrew his
objection, and the new rollcall was had.
Schlesinger's motion was lost this time
by 37 noes against 31 ayes.
Melick -forestalled the committee
amendments by offering one to strike out
all of section 2, which makes it a felony
to publish by writing or printing that
Asiatic cholera or bubonic plagues exists
until the State Board of Health has de
cided that the disease does exist and has
tntered It upon its records.
Brown of San Mateo, Schleslnger, Mel
ick. Foster and P>liz spoke In favor of
the amendment, Fisk and Carter oppos
ing it.
At 3.30 in the afternoon session, after
the Senate special file had been disposed
of. the debate was resumed.
James. Sutro. Sheridan. Chandler,
Brown of San MatPO and Radcllff made
pleas for llbÂ«Â»rtv of speech and of the
press. Radcliff and Melick served notice
that they as editors, would stand on their
constitutional rights if the bills were
passed and publish the truth. If public in
terests demanded It. Johnson made an
effective plea for the bill as It stood.
The amendment finally came to a vote
somewhat after 5 o'clock, and the result
was 30 ayes to 22 noes. Sutro, Meltck.
Dunlap Feliz and others were on their
feet demanding a call of the house before
Pendleton had a chance to announce the
result. Johnson tried to coach the Speak
er to assert that he had announced the
result. Pendleton admitted that he had
not but proceeded to do so, and then de
clared the demand for the call of the
house was made too late.
"But I was on rr>y feet demanding the
call of the house before you announced
the result." protested Sutro, angrily.
"Yes, Mr. Sutro, but I did not recog
nize you." was the candid admission of
the Speaker.
On roll call on a motion to adjourn Su
tro refused to vote. He said:
"I refuse to vote because I have Just
boen refused recognition by the Speaker
when I was entitled to it."
Those who had heard Pendleton's earlier
outburst at a lancted reflection on the
Justness of his rulings ejepected an erup
tion, with fire and smoke and molten lava,
but none came. Except for the Speaker's
Intervention to prevent a call of the
house, which he hed so recently allowed
on demand of Ms side of the fight, the
amendment would probably have . pre-
vailed, as the absentees were mostly op
ponents of the bill.
The contest will go on to-morrow. Nu
merous amendments will be offered and
action on the committee amendments will
be delayed. Delegations from the San
Francisco commercial bodies are expected
up to explain how well satisfied they are
with the amended blllsl In a word,- the
programme measures that seemed on the
point of being passed with flashlight alac
rity have become the subject of the bit
terest contest of the session.
While it has had a course not always
plain and smooth, still the bill appropriat
ing $100,000 to protect the State from va
grant bacilli had met no setback until it
struck the Senate Finance Committee" to
day. It emerged from a hot executive
session after being beaten on a vote to
recommend that it do pass.
The vote was a close one and was taken
only after arguments pro and con had
befogged the Intellects of all the members
and they all went back to their original
ideas. There were thirteen members of
the committee present when it was
moved that tho bill be favorably recom
mended. Wolfe, Leavitt, Hoey, Byrnes.
Nutt, Tyrrell of Nevada and I^alrd voted
"aye" and Flint. Belshaw, Rowell, Luch
slnger, Greenwell and ' Smith of Kern
voted "no." It was 7 to 6 for the bill,
but before the vote was finished Sims
came in and by voting "no" tied the vote
and guve the bill its first defeat. Devlin
was absent. Had he been there he would
have voted for the bill and secured a fa
vorable report.
Successful In heading off a favorable re
port, the enemies of the measure then at
tempted to put through a motion to re
port tho bill back unfavorably, but this
motion was lost, for some of the com
mittee reasoned that the report of the
present commission investigating the sub
ject might make some appropriation nec
essary and therefore they did hot wish to
bo placed in a- position of antagonism.
The seven "ayes" were good Tor seven
"noes" on any adverse proposition, so the
motion was lost. And then a motion to
refer the bill back without recommenda

will go on the file. And all the time
Devlin was upstairs at another committee
meeting.
Speaker Pendleton claims to-night that
the committee amendments were adopted
and he has ordered Assembly bill 558 en
grossed and to third reading. The oppo
sition regards this action as most arbi
trary and asserts that the bills are still
on the second reading file, regardless of
what juggling may have taken place. It
Is certainly true that after the all-day
debate â¢ on Melick's . amendment the
Speaker made no query as to whether
there were more amendments to be of
fered and no announcement ordering the
bill to engrossment and third reading.
The opposition will contend that what
ever the fate of tha committee amend
ments the consideration of the bill is un
finished business and 'amendments are
still in order.
â¢ Assembly bill 559, on special order this
morning, was not considered at all. If
the Speaker's action is upheld by the
Assembly In the morning, there. will be
no further consideration of bill 558 until It
comes up for final passage, some days in
the future. If it take the regular order, or
possibly Thursday. If It be made a special
order. The journal Is straight, according
to the Speaker's ruling. It shows that
bill 5&S has gone to engrossment' and
third reading, but those who were watch
ing for Just such an order heard none,
and half a dozen more Assemblymen
who had amendments to the bill and
were waiting for the call for more
amendments and the announcement. "If
there be no further amendments, the bill
will go to engrossment and third read
ing," in order to submit their amend
ments, heard no such announcement.
They' arc all of the opinion that the bill
Is still an inoompleted second reading and
cn file for further consideration to-mor

DAL HAWKIXS. tho California
lightweight boxer, has taken a
big contract on his hands In
agreeing to try for the scalp of
George McFadden, the Eastern
fighter, who arrived In this city last Mon
day. The ring devotees of this city have
great respect for Hawkins' left, but they
say that McFadden will block It with as
much ease as -.lid Frank Erne in the mem
orable battle fought In this city -some
years ago. Again, it is said that Hawkins
has not the strength and hitting powers
that he was once known to possess, and
It Is also said that he will need all these
and something more when he tackles such
a rugged fighter as McFadden.
HawkinV friends are more optimistic in
their views. They claim that Dal Is as
good as of yore and that he will make the
Easterner, "beware of him. Hawkins is
training at the Fourteen-mile House and
Is rapidly rounding into form. He has
taken excellent care of himself and la con
fident that he can take McFadden s meas
ure
McFadden did not waste a minute in se
curing training quarters He went to
Croll's Gardens, in Alaroeda. and before
the sun had reached its meridian was lim
bering up his muscles at the various ma
chines in tho gymnasium. The visiting
lightweight If a husky-looking fellow. De
termination is written on his face and his
countenance has been well seasoned by
jabs uppercuts and swings. He is not the
handsomest fellow in the ring, but he is
an ugly customer to tackle.
McFadden wi]l battle with Hawkins be
fore the Twentieth Century Club on the
evening of the 2Sth. They will fight in the

CINCINNATI. Feb. 12.â War was de
clared here to-day by the owners of six
tracks against the Xcw Western Jockey
Club. The six members or tho Western
Jockey Club, who were not allotted dates
when the new jockey club was recently
cj-panized in Chicago, met an<J reorganized
thei old- American Turf Congress, perfect
ing their plans for tho circuit durinp the
oorrinp Eoason and aHottlnir the dates.
The contest now will be for recognition
by the Eastern Jockey Club. The reor
ganized American Turf Congress feels
confident that I>!raont and others in New
York will recognize it as against a West
ern jockoy club. As there are eight mem
bers In the latter, ns comrared with six
members In the former, there was some
rj-jcEtian cs to the power of the minority.
but legal advisers held the action of the
Â«irbt members in Chicago to be illegal
iin<2 the proceedings here to-day to be In
accordance with law. aJI of the b!x
jockey clubs r-'irticSpatinp to-day in the
reorganization of the American Turf Con
gress were represented In person or by
counsel. Resolutions were adopted as fol
lows:
Whereas. The American Turf Congress was
organized Xovember, 1SS3. and has continued In
existence since that time, and on January 1,
JS01, consisted of the following members: New
Louisville Jockey Club of Louisville, the Lato
nia Jockey Club of Covington. the St. Louis
Jockey Club of St. Louis, the Tennessee Breed

Jockey Club of Chicago, the Harlem Jockey
Club cf Chicago, the Highland Park Club of
Detroit, the Western Turf Association of San
Francisco; and
Whereas, Every provision and regulation of
the constitution, by-laws or rules of the said
American Turf Congress Is for the single pur
pose of the maintenance of the declared object
cf that organization, which is the Improvement
of the breed and the development of horses
through promotion of the Interest of the Araeri
lcan racing turf, the prevention, detection and
punishment of fraud thereon and the adoption
of regulations and rules to be known as the
American racing rules for the uniform govern
ment of racins; and
Wfcereas. The administration of the affairs
of the American Turf Congress to that end has
not b*en questioned and may not be truthfully
questioned; and
Whereas. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
eight persons, to-wit: Lawrence- "Voung, George
G. Perkins, R. Fitzgerald, M. Nathanson, C
II. Bush, Robert Aull, S. R. Montgomery and
Â¦\\. K. Schulte haw lately met in Chicago and
undertaken to organize themselves into what
they call the "Western Jockey Club" with the
avowed purpose of superseding Â¦ the American
Turf Congress and governing racing in the
West. and. with the dissimilation .that usually
characterizes unworthy action, pretended to
If acting as Individuals and not as representa
tives of the jockey clubs or associations of
which they are the leading members, though
but for that connection their pretensions
would tiut subject them to ridicule: and
Whereas. The undersigrfed members of the
American Turf Congress, confident that the
I'ublic must tee that the only purpose of their
ffllow members, the Xew Louisville Jockey
Club, the Latonla Jockey Club, the St. Louis
Jockev Club, the New Memphis Jockey Club,
the New Louisiana Jockey C'lab, the Chicago
Jeckey Club, the Washington Park Club and
the Harlem Jockey Club, through the individ
uals named above, is to oust them from par
ticipation in the regulation of racing in the
We*t, and having failed to find, cause for
expelling them from the American Turf Con
press and having without courage to them
s<-1vps withdrawn from the said congress and
f.pht for supremacy in the open; and notwith
standing that they have full control of the
offices of the congress and a two-thirds vote
in the organization, not daring , to pass any
rule or regulation they can live under which
the undersigned will not, they are given to the
unworthy and despicable method above recited
tr attempt the exclusion of the undesigned
from participating in regulations in the West;
therefore, be it
Â¦ Resolved; By the undersigned, as representa
tives of the following members of the Ameri
can Turf Congress: The Queen City Club of
Newport. Ky. ; the Tennessee Breeders' Asso

it now has; and, further
Resolved. That we call upon the press and

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
The last'race of. the day, was'a splendid
victorv for Tommy .Burns on 'Artllla, the
second choice, Â¦; Brownie Anderson, *wlth
Henry up, was Artilla'snemesis from the
time the bunch .was broken until the finish
of. the one mile course. Ajtllla was game
and the. Brownie could not overtake her.
Edgardo, Winnie O'Connor in the saddle,
won the mile and a sixteenth. The tip
went round the ring that Edgardo would
make a funeral- of the other four starters.
The opening price was 8 to 1,- but the best
that could be obtained when â¢ the >â¢ horses
were at the post was 4 to 1; Owensboro,
ridden by â¢ Henry, sold the ; favorite, but
was at no: time within striking .distance.
Handieapper,; the second. choice, sent- glad
thrills down the backs of his supporters
until. the bunch" turned into the stretch.
Then Kdgardo moved up and passed under
the -wire a safe distance ahead of Handi
eapper, who was fighting it out with
Owensboro for Â¦ the place. ... -
Tommy Burns steered Ravelling through
safe in the -fourth race, leaving Berendos,
a. 30 to 1 shot, the place and Tola the ?how
money. There was a heavy plav on Rav
ei.ing, which resulted in a backing down
from 3 to 1 to 7 to 5. The bunch of nine
got off well, Bcrendos moving up at the
tlrst station and holding the lead! until
the stretch, when Burns whipped up a
bit and passed him with Ravelling. The
course was five and a half furlongs.
The second race, a six furlong event,
was easy for Antagone, owned bv Caruth
ors & Shields. Burns had the leg and he
took a flying leap away from the bunch
at the start. Antagone was never headed.
Maclaren,^ the favorite, and Formatu?
made a driving finish, the former barely
saving the place. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
The first race, over a seven furlongs
course, was won by Barrack, 7 to 10/ Until
tho stretch was reached Barrack was be
hind a strong gate, but broko through
at this point, winning from Racetto by a
single-jointed nose. The tip was out that
Greatland would do something brilliant
and the odd^ came down from 30 to 10.
Greatland passed tinder the wire a length
tnhind Racetto. . . .
The event of the day, the five-eighths
of a mile race for a WOO purse, was run
close to the Tanforan' record time. Sam
HSldreth's Waring, the 1 to 4 favorite,
piloted over the live-eighths route by Hen
ry, came home in this race with all the
honors and the money. O'Connor on Ken
llworth, the second choice, did some rough
riding 1 on the last turn, but Waring was
coming up tao fast to be headed otf, and
finished two full lengths ahead of O'Con
nor's mount. Tommy Burns, on Specific,
got the show. Rio de Altar, Miss Made
line and Redwald walked .in behind,
rtedwald and Rio were on their worst be
havior at the post, making the start a
long and painful one. Dwyer finally got
them all off together, however. . Tod
Sloan was to- pilot The Lady, but she
was not started. - .
A slight diminution In the crowd was
noticeable at Tanforan yesterday, but the
belting was brisk. , The same eleven
hooks with the two field operators were
in evidence and all doing a fair business.
The track was fast and the weather fine.
in the majority of races rode eas
ily one, two, three. Burns was mounted
on three winners, Henry on two, and
O'Connor on one. But a single race
movad away, from the Â¦ favorites or sec
ond chok-os, and that was, the fifth,
which Edgardo won handily. . At the
opening Louis & -Obermeyer's entry sold
os high as 8 to 1. but there was plenty of
money in the ring and when the horses
vent to the post the best obtainable price
was' 4 to 1.
fp-rp^OMMY BURNS, with Henry and
I O'Connor, carried off the. saddle

AT TANFORAN TRACK
Â¦ The feature at Tanforan to-day will be
the argument between Articulate and
Canmore over a mile for a purse of
now. . ...
Some time ago Charley Boots lost Ed

ing won the fifth event yesterday t!ie
Elmwood farm owner boosted the winner
$300. but did not get the horse back. |
Track Notes.
Bookmaker Fred Cook's handy gelding
The Bobby downed game little Morinel
in the mile and a quarter run. The chest
nut gelding closed a 7 to 10 choice, and
after leading most of the way won ; by
threo open lengths .in 1 :OSVi- Essence,
with Ransch up, finished a close third.
Back again in the stable of his original
owners. Hughes & Elliott. Dandy Jim cel
ebrated the occasion by boating out St.
Rica in the mile selling affair, starting fa
vorite. Bullman cut out the running with
St. Rica, but his mount eould not stand
the pressure, losing the decision by half
a length. JAct Prince leceived some back
ing at oads of 4>i to 1 and then ran last.
Bullman got home first astride Horton
In the final seven furlong number. Mounce
did not sot away from the post any too
well with Torslna, tho favorite, finishing
over a length back of Horton at the close.
Pat Morrissey had all of his old-time
speed, failing to last the route, however.
Thirteen answered roll call in the six
furlong sprint following. Marcato, the
Burns & Waterhouse entry, undoubtedly
possessed the most class, but the suppo
sition was that Ransch couldn't handle
the big fellow. The smart money then

A .DISPLAY OF THE TEETHgTessman at large instead of a , reappor
tlonment of the State into eight districts,
said Mr. "Woods. "This Congressman
should be the dean of the delegation rep
resenting the entire territory of Califor
nia. Of necessity there are antagonistic
interests existing between the Congres
sional districts. The placing of these In
terests in the hands of a Congressman at
large would unionize the work.
"If California wants to maintain influ
ence) in Congress she will have to dÂ» as
other States do. by seeding her Repre
sentatives back from terra to term."
CONGRESSMAN S. D. "WOODS
OF THE SECOND DISTRICT.
WHO IS NOW HERE.
to^w^HE Hon. S. D. "Woods, Represen-
II tative of the Second Congressional
1 District of California, arrived from
Jl - "Washington, D. C, on the over
land train late Monday evening
and is stopping at the Grand.
The main" reason for Congressman
"Woods' return to California Is to endeavor
to make all commercial bodies in the State
send at once hearty Invitations to the
Congressional Committee on Rivers and
Harbors to pay a visit to California at the
close of the present session. Mr. "Woods
is working hard 5 toward this end, and
stated yesterday that the members of the
committee had all signified their consent
to pay a visit to California should they
receive an assu/ance that the. commercial
bodies of the State .were anxious for them
to do so.
"It would be of great benefit to Cali
fornia," said Congressman "Woods yester
day, "lf the committee made a visit, to
this State. The trouble In Congress Is the
want of knowledge of the need and neces
sities of California. . Congress must be
taught that the central point of the em
pire is the Pacific Coast, now that the
Philippines and the Hawaiian Islands are
American territory.
"In presenting arguments for the neces
sity of an appropriation for improvements
of rivers and harbors the committee needs
an object lesson. I talked the matter over
with members of the Rivers and Harbors
Committee. Including the chairman, the
Hon. T. E. Burton, and found they -were
all willing to come to California during
the present eprlng. I want to see the in
vitations extended before the adjournment
of Congress, which takes place March 3."
Sacramento has already sent an invita
tion to the committee; so has San Diego.
The Hon. R. J. Waters from the Sixth
District is now in. Los Angeles and Is tak
ing steps to see that an Invitation Is sent
from that city.
.To-day Congressman "Woods will wait
upon the San Francisco and the Oakland
Â¦Chambers of Commerce and In detail ex
plain to both bodies the great value It
will be to California to entertain the com
mittee out here.
"It would-be a wise move for Califor
nia to provide for the election of a Con-

Mr. Kingsbury was nominated by Eliza
beth Porter, decedent's niece. The Public
Administrator . opposed the appointment
of Kingsbury on the ground that Mrs.
Porter, who came here from Virginia
shortly before her uncle's death, was not
a resident of this State and hence was not
vested with power to nominate an admin
istrator. Mrs. Porter testified, however,
that she Intended living here permanently
and had rented apartments. Judge Cof
fey held this/showing to be sufficient and
Kingsbury was appointed, i Judge Coffey's

MINNEAPOLIS. Feb. 12.â The prosecu
tion in the Hamilton murder case rested
tpnlay after introducing the sensational
testimony of Officer Thomas J. Rooney,
who testified that Hamilton said to him
when he was arre3ted: :
"I . will go with you. I am prepared to
take the consequences. IJet the law take
its course. 1 killed him, but I did it in
self-defense: This trouble Is all on ac
count of a girl." . . â¢
Hamilton listened to the statement with
a perfectly impassive face. Rooney's evi
dence related to the conversation with
Hamilton on the way from the West
Hotel to the police station.
Every effort is being made to have A.
M. Barbee, the, St. Louis traveling man,
brought here to testify. His evidence is
said to be of the highest importance to
the defense. Hamilton, It la said, will
take the stand and give his version of
the fight that ended in Day's death.
After court adjourned there was an im
pulsive movement toward Hamiltonâ men
vieing with women to shake his hand and
utter the hope that he would be able to
prove his innocence.- Â¦ ' ' .

MURDER DUE
TO A WOMAN
of That Unmusical Instrument,
the Piano.
Godowsky has come and Godowsky has
conquered! When the pianist camo out
on the platform yesterday afternoon at
Sherman-Clay Hall the audience found it
difficult, indeed, to realize that the small,
modest, eminently unassuming gentleman
quietly bowing his greeting to them was
the distinguished artist in whose praise
whole symphonies have been written by
the foremost critics of the old and the
new worlds. But his identity was
established as soon as he touched the
keys, and $hat. too, in despite of a lame
little finger from which the pianist was
suffering. 9
Godowsky is only to be described in the
superlative. Through him and the few
other elect of the earth like him that most
essentially unmusical Instrument that he
has chosen as his means of expression
justifies its existence. The pfano is trans
lated, sublimated, transformed into a
thing of beauty, a Joy for ever. Any
thing more exquisitely beautiful than
Godowsky's tone it is impossible to con
ceive. The soft depth of it, the round,
golden, velvety richness of it. This is, in
deed, where the peculiar marvel of his
technique comes In. As to the mere me
chanics of his trade, no one we have yet
heard here can approach him. "With, all
the poetry of Paderewski, he has twice
the facility; with the commanding virtu
osity of. Rosenthal. he has all the tech
nique of beauty Â¦which the latter lacks.

XETT YORK, Feb. 12.â The Commer
cial Advertiser says to-day: "In acquiring
control of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, the Harriman syndicate also
obtained control of the Morgan Steam
ship Lino and the Pacific Mail Steamship
Line. It did not. however, secure any
control over the Mexican International
Railway nor of any of the property of- the
Pacific Improvement Company.
"The Mexican International Company,
which has about TOO miles of complete
road. i3 the only non-subsidized road in
Mexico. This railroad was built practi
cally' under the supervision of Collis P.
Huntington and it now belongs to the old
Pacific Improvement Company, the stock
of which is owned by the Huntington.
Mark Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker
estates. It is generally regarded as
the Mexican division of the Southern Pa
cific system, but actually the Southern
Pacific agreement has no control over the
Mexican International Company.
"It is likely that when the Pacific Im
provement Company winds up its affairs,
which will be done as soon as practicable,
the railroad and mining properties owned
by this comoany will be sold. Whether
or not the Southern Pacific Company will
acquire the Mexican road remains to bo
' prevails that after awhile the
Central Pacific lines will be taken out of
the Southern Pacific system and made a
nart of the Union Pacific system. The
Central Pacific, which extends from Ok
den to San Francisco, a distance of 1354
miles Is essential to the Union Pacific's
transcontinental system and its separa
tion from the Southern Pacific would
still leave the latter a complete trans
continental system. Although both of
these great systems are now under the
control of the same group of capitalists,
it Is safe to say that each corporation
will retain distinct traffic interests."

I am Inclined to believe in the old adage
that "An ounce of prevention Is worth
more than a pound of cure." so when
there has been prevailing sickness in the
community, such as grippe, malaria, fev-
ers, etc., I take the compound, and thus
far have had none of these ailments, al-
though they have been prevalent all
around me. so that I have, great faith in
Paine's Celery Compound as a preventive.
I have recommended the compound to
very many of my friends, and I have the
Eatisfaction of knowing- that it has done
them very much good.
I was cashier of the bank in South
County for twenty-nine years, and for
the last fifteen years was secretary and
treasurer of the new savings bank, in

I was suffering from a number of old
chronic complaints. Among the rest 1
had complete nervous prostration, from
which I suffered for six years. In June,
1891. I commenced the use of'Paine's Cel-

tles I fpund that ihe old complaints be-
gan to ease up, which encouraged me to
keep on with the compound. I soon got
over all those troubles that had clung to
me for bo long, and got out and was more
like myself. Since then I have taken a

An improved appetite, sound digestion,
uninterrupted sleep and an energetic ner-
vous . condition invariably follow the use
of Paine's Celery Compound.
The heavy, alarming pain In the bach,
and loins disappears; the growing pale-
ness, nervousness and loss of flesh ts
stopped, and a bright, buoyant feeling
gradually takes the place of that unend-
ing sense of tire and nervous depression.
Its remarkable power over disease lies
in Its active replacing: of worn-out parts
by new, healthy ones, and Its healing and
purifying action among the most minute
tissues of the body.
Kothlng In the past has ever ap-
proached It In power of building up
weakened nerve tissues and giving
strength to the tired body. In severe
Cases of persistent headaches, dyspepsia,
neuralgia and sleeplessness, due to nerv-
ous feebleness. Paine's Celery Compound
has a record of rapid and lasting: cures
that embraces every city and town In
the wide sweep of the United States.
For recruiting the strength and spent
energies of men and women advanced In
years there can bo no substitute for
Paine's Celery Compound. It is thÂ« one
preparation considered worthy the name
of a true nerve food and blood remedy by
physicians throughout the country. It la
prescribed by them in every State in the
Union to tone up the system, regrulate the
nerves and restore health and strength.

a number of eld chronic complaints, Mr.
Potter was induced by relatives to use
Paine's Celery Compound for the first
time. The effect was immediately bene-
ficial. The uninterrupted good health that
he has since enjoyed dates from that
time. Mr. Potter's grateful letter to the
proprietors of Paine's Celery Compound
Is based on long personal experience and
a!so a full knowledge of what it has done
for very many of his friends to whom he

edy that made him well. Mr. Potter's let-
ter Is given In its entirety:

DURING the recent campaign nothing bothered
Colonel Bryan more than questions about the
disfranchisement of negroes in North Caro
lina. He faced every way in answering to avoid a col
lision with his^ Southern supporters. The constitution
I of that State was changed so as to disfranchise all
illiterates who are not descended from men qualified ro
vote in 1865. This leaves the ballot with ignorant
whites but takes it* from ignorant negroes. After it
was adopted the disfranchises, of North Carolina
found themselves in a peculiar position. The amend
ment was sure to be carried to the courts and as sure
to reach the Supreme Court of the State. That bodv
consisted of three Republicans (Faircloth, Furches
and Douglass), and a Democrat (Clark) and a Popu
list (Montgomery). As the Republicans have the ma
jority of the bench they must be driven off it be
fore the disfranchising amendment can reach them, as
they .would surely decide that it deprives the negro of
the ballot on account of the servitude of his ances
tors, which is forbidden by the Federal constitution.
Therefore these Republican Judges must be expelled*
Â¦ from the bench by impeachment. But there must be
! some excuse for such a proceeding; a case must be
made against them that will enable the partisan Legis
lature to keep a straight face and pretend that it is
acting in the public interest. The pretext for im
peachment is of interest in itself and for the use pro
posed to be made of it. Four years ago the fusionists
I in North Carolina elected Theophilus White State
j Fish Commissioner. Two years ago the Democrats
dropped fusion and carriecTthe State single-handed.
Then they wanted all the offices and proceeded to
; oust White in the middle of his term. But the case
was taken to the Supreme Court, which decided thar
he could not be deprived of his office until the expira
tion of his term. The Democrats, determined that if
one of them could not draw the salary no. one should,
thereupon passed a law forbidding the payment .of
White's salary. The matter again went to the Su
preme Court and the three Republican Judges issued
a mandamus ordering the Auditor to issue a warrant
for White's salary and the Treasurer to pay it out of
the shellfish fund. For this judicial act they are to
be impeached. The case against them is very appro-
FOL1TICAL IMPEACHMENT.
Â¦ The public, would of course be gratified, to have
taxes reduced in any way the reductions were made,
but the present outlook does not promise that full
satisfaction expected when the bill was first taken
under consideration. The Senate appears to be re
solved that the revised bill shall contain no provision
requiring express and telegraph companies to. pay
their share of the tax without shifting it upon the peo
ple, and the House can hardly force it to surrender the
point. The 4th of March is near at hand, and the
Representatives are more eager than the Senators to
pass the bill. Consequently the Senators have the ad
vantage, and they will doubtless make full use of it!
It is therefore almost certain that the bill' to be
agreed upon will be rr.uch more like the Senate" meas
ure than that framed by the House, and with that the
public must be content at present.
The objectors having been voted do^n, the bill is
not to be suspended â at least it is not suspended at
that point. It happens, however, that the life of this
Congress is now very short. There will be required
prompt work on the part of the conference to get. the
.houses into agreement in time for the passage of the
measure before the end comes, and it may yet be held
up in committee.
Such a decisive majority in favor of a conference
may be taken as a proof that the House is desirous
"of passing the bill at this session and is not unwilling
to agree upon a compromise. Richardson "of Ten
nessee expressed what is probably the opinion of a 1
majority of both parties when in opposing the consti
tutional objection he said: "The people ask relief from
the burden of excessive taxation, and Congress has
undertaken to provid: it. Now just as the relief is
about to be realized a fine drawn constitutional par
liamentary issue is raised. If the objection prevails
the friends of high taxation would rejoice, for by a
technicality they would have suspended the reduction
bill in' midair between the two houses."
AS was expected, the House has refused to. agree
to the alterations made by the Senate in the
war revenue bill and has asked for a confer
ence. There was, in fact, on the part of some of the
members a desire to reject the Senate bill summarily
as an unconstitutional measure. The^House has the
sole right of originating revenue measures. It framed
the bill providing for a reduction of the war taxes.
The Senate eliminated almost every line of the
original measure except the title and tly enacting
clause, and framed what is virtually a new bill.' Con
sequently the House had some show of right to reject
it on the score of a violation of the constitution. For
tunately, however, only a small fraction of the mem
bers present were in favor of fighting it on that
ground, and after a sharp debate a motion asking the
Senate for a conference was carried by a vote of 233
to 38.
WAR REVENUE REDUCTIONS.
The Call is not a chsmpion of the Police Commis
sioners, the Chief of Police or any other person whose
reputation is at stake in the im-estigation. It is, how
ever, the champion of fair dealing and justice. The
committee has r.o legal r.or moral right to permit
any man's reputation to be sworn away an hearsay evi
dence or the statements of unknown persons. If the
names of the Chinese informants cannot be made pub
lic without exposing them to peril of death, the
names should be given at least to the Police Commis
sioners, so that the accused may know how to re
fute it if it be refutable. V '- <
It is well known that after service in Chinatown
Sergeant Price of the police foree was broken upon
testimony given in secret by men with whom he was
not confronted and whose names he never knew, and
evidence was given yesterday that a big sum of money
was raised in Chinatown to have him removed because
he suppressed highbinders. That evidence should be
a warning to the committee. Already there are evi
dences cropping out that there is something of per
secution back of the investigation. The committee is
not suspected of being a party to the persecution, but
it must be careful to give the accused all the rights
to which strict justice entitles them. It should per
mit no man's reputation to be assailed by a hidden
witness.
The Chinese are not devoid of cunning. The mo
ment a police officer offends them by a strict perform
ance of his duty, or in any other way, they are prompt
to set about circulating stories to his discredit. That
fact is so well known that many of the most faithful
officers of the force avoid as far as possible doing duty
in Chinatown. It is easy for a yellow rascal to start
a lie, and the public mind prone to suspect evil is often
onlj- too ready to lend a credulous ear.
It is very well known in California that Chinese
testimony is not absolutely reliable under the best
of circumstances. It .is not always easy to get the
exact -truth from a Chinaman even when he is sub
jected to cross-examination in open court. What
reliance, then, can be placed upon charges made by
them in dark corners end under the seal of confidence?
The argument that the publication of the names of
the informants would place them in peril of their lives
is strong, but is not sufficient to excuse the publica
tion of their testimony without their names. If such
practices were admitted as a rule no man's reputation
would be safe against the slander of some cowardly
liar who would tell a story in confidence to an accus
ing official and then plead- that he be not confronted
with the accused Jest lie be placed in peril.
It can hardly be necessary to point out 'to the com
mittee that such testimonj- as that is valueless, and the
admission of it is opposed to all American precedent
and to all principles cf justice. An accused person
has a right to know the names o'f his accusers and to
be confronted by them. That right is thoroughly un
derstood by the public, and if it be not accorded to
all accused persons in this investigation public sym-
I>atli3' will rightly be on the side of the accused, and
the committee itself will be censured and condemned.
Such being the case it will be well for the commit
tee to beware of making any false step or mistake in
conducting the examination. There is danger that
such a step has been n:ade. The committee has per
mitted certain witnesses to testify that they were told
by Chinamen that bribes had been offered to the po
lice and at the same time have permitted the wit
nesses to withhold the names of the Chinamen who
pave the information.
RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED.
WITH general satisfaction the people of San
Francisco welcomed the arrival of the Legisla
tive committee appointed to investigate ths
charges made against the police authorities of the city
in connection with their dealings with gambling and
other vices in Chinatown. The satisfaction was due
to the belief that the examination would be impartial,
thorough and fair. Anything therefore that suggests
I-'trsecution, or gives ground for a suspicion that the
desire of the committee is not so much to reveal the
whole truth as to make a case against the police, will
difgust the public and weaken the effect of any report
the committee mav make.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
For the people of California the chance afforded at
Buffalo to find a profitable market for their goods is
an excellent one.. The task of providing an exhibi
tion of the industries of the State is in good hands,
and with a fair amount of co-operation on the part of
producers, manufacturers and merchants the exhibi
tion ought to attract to California not only a consid
erable number of home-seekers and capitalists seeking
investment, but also a much greater share of South
American trade than we have yet obtained..
Many reasons have been offered in explanation of
the rapid increase of German trade with South Amer
ica and the comparative stagnation oftmr own. It is
said the Germans have better Consuls, have more
thorough banking relations with those countries, and
have the further advantage of a merchant marine sup
ported.by the Government. Each of those reasons
undoubtedly counts for something, in the problem;
but all of them combined would not account for the
whole of it. It is indisputable that we have never
made a really resolute effort to get the Central and
South American trade. If now the Buffalo Exposi
tion leads to more comprehensive attempts in that
direction it can hardly fail to bring to the Unit:d
States much of the business that is now given to our
European competitors.
If that view be the correct one the Buffalo Exhi
bition may prove more beneficial than if its purposes
were the same as that of the great expositions at
Philadelphia and at Chicago. There is something
radically wrong in our trade relations with the coun
tries to the south of us. The great bulk of their im
ports are drawn from Europe, notwithstanding the
fact that the United States is much better -fitted to
supply their needs economically than is any country
of the 01c* World. Accordingly it is time for an ear
nest effort to be made to obtain our rightful share of
the trade.
Thus the Philadelphia .Public Ledger recently said:
"The Centennial Exhibition was less a Dazaar than a
great museum of the products of human activity. Sorau
exhibitors entered it in order to advertise and extend
their business, but there were many others who dis
regarded commercial interests and exhibited for the
honor of the nation. The Buffalo Exhibition will be
more in the nature of a bazaar, a commercial enter
prise for the promotion of trade! No one will be ex
pected to send exhibits to if unless he sees in it a
promise of some return for his investment, and it is
because the Pan- American Exhibition offers some
what exceptional opportunities to bring the products
of our mills and factories before the people of the
most populous States in the Union that Philadelphia
manufacturers ought to consider its value as an ad
vertising medium."
| â I ROM the tone of discussions in the East con-
I cerning the Buffalo Exposition it appears the
enterprise is" regarded in that section not so much
as a means of making a grand spectacular display of
the products of American. industry for the entertain
ment and enlightenment of the public as a commer
cial venture designed to promote immediate trade
among the countries of < this hemisphere/

We repeat that the country is not indulging in a
cheerful mood over the Cuban prospect. The an
nouncement that the treaty of Paris absolves us in
part from the obligation assumed to Cuba in the reso
lution declaring war against Spain is not well re
ceived. Nothing in the treaty of Paris compels us to
violate our^ promise unless we choose to so construe
it If any such clause appears in that treaty it is our
fault that it is there, for Spain was powerless to make
us consent to anything we did not wish. To fall back
upon such a technicality will not satisfy the country's
sense of honor.
The example is ancient, but may well be followed
by this country. The complications that will other
wise appear are most painful, and we, will be. in the
position of increasing our responsibilities and losing
our self-respect.
The country would rejoice if Congress, before it ad
journs, would indicate its views of the Cuban con
stitution and authorize the President to accept that
instrument upon conformity thereto and withdraw our
troops upon the organization of a government.
Therefore it was decreed that the Roman garrisons
should be withdrawn as speedily as possible and the
people be left free- to govern themselves.
But all this was before the Caesars, when Rome it
self was free.
Among the bright spots in the history of Rome
prior to her abandonment to a policy of causeless con
quest is her conduct under circumstances that sug
gest our relations with Cuba.
After Paulus Emilius had delivered Macedonia and
Illyria from the greed and tyranny of Perseus the
Roman Senate gave liberty to the people of those
countries "in order," as the decree recited, "that all
nations might know that the purpose of the Roman
arms was not to subject free people, but to deliver
such as were enslaved, so that the one under the pro
tection of the Roman name might always retain their
liberty, and the other, who were under the rule of
kings, might be treated with more lenity and justice
by them through consideration for the Romans, or
that whenever war should arise between' those kings
and the Roman people the nations might know that
the issue of those wars would be victory for the
Romans and liberty for them;"
Within the last few days there have been signs of
division among Republicans in Congress upon the ex
ternal policy of the Government The issues that
have come from the Spanish war are by no means
settled, nor is there unanimity of agreement, in the
party concerning them. It is not well to add a
wrong Cuban policy to the accumulating difficulties
and anxieties of the situation. We should make our
exit from Cuba as speedily and as gracefully as pos
sible consistent with the continued maintenance of
order there.
Certain ill advised utterances of Senator Beveridge
of Indiana in favor of holding on to Cuba regardless
of our promise are now recalled, and there is a general
feeling of disquiet at the outlook. It is said in some
quarters that there will be members of Congress who
will insist that the Cuban constitution shall contain
a gratitude clause, in express terms thanking the
United States for intervening in behalf of the island
against Spain. This is fantastic. If such a position
is taken it will subject the Republican party to a fo-m
of which will be found hard to answer or
explain. If Cuba, of her own motion, chose to ex
press gratitude to us, while one might question the
taste of putting it into the fundamental law, there
would be no valid objection to it. Even such an ex
pression, however, can neither make nor blot out his
tory, which will deal impartially with our motives and
our methods in the Spanish war, Cuba would bet
ter leave gratitude to us in the hearts of her people
and keep it out of the constitution. From our side
there is no defense possible of the position that we
would take in denying to Cuba the independence we
promised until she thanks us, constitutionally, for giv
ing it to her. Such an act would be the hissing and
byword of history. Thanks enforced in that way
would be without sincerity and without merit, and
such action would stamp Cuba with spaniel-like
cringing and present this country in an attitude for
which no apology can be made.
IT seems certain that the Cuban constitution cannot
be ready for submission to Congress in time for
action at this session. This is to be greatly re
gretted. It will mean our continued military occu
pancy and goyernment of the island for another year.
This will give strength to the suspicion that we do not
mean to keep faith. â¢â¢'"'"
It is believed that a party exists in Cuba that has
an understanding with annexationists in this country
and has been influential in delaying the work of the
constitutional convention in order to prolong Ameri
can occupancy and increase the chances of making it
permanent.

She laid the facts of her case as abova

took her place on the stand and told ths
story of his home life with the first Mrs.
Stierlen.

He was forced to admit his fine in the
Federal Court for writing the indecent
letters referred to.
Attention was next turned to his bank
account. He stated that speculation in
oil had reduced his bank account to $3000.
He was- told to bring his bank account
and books into court this .morning, when
the hearing of the case will be concluded.
Everybody says how strange it is that
the Pattosien Company don't see any dull
times in business. Nothing strange about
it We do the business all the time, and
that is all there }s to it. The real secret
is our low rent gives us a chance to

Strange, Strange, Strange!
The agreement was signed, she says,
and remembering the oft-told story of the
laxity of Dakota divorce laws, her hus
band went th^re and after a few weeks'
litigation secured hia decree. He forth
with returned to this city and married a
Miss Rosa Scott. The former Mrs. Stier
len waited until after Stlerlen'.s second
marriage had been solemnized. "It Is al
leged, and then went to Dakota and ln
' stituted proceedings to set aside the de-
I cree granted her husband. She produced
j the agreement and the final decree of the
Dakota Supreme Court adjudging that the
divorce had been procured by Stierlen
through collusion with Mrs. Stierlen, and
the decree was set aside.
In tlje meantime more trouble was brew
ing ftfr Stierlen. Prior to his second mar
riage Alfred Isson, a brother of his first
wife, sent his wife to this- city from Mex
ico to visit his sister, Mrs. Stierlen. She
j remained some time and finally departed
for home on the ill-fated Collma. Before
Stierlen learned that Mrs. Isson was
among the victims of that terrible disas
ter he mailed her several letters that were
subsequently the basis for the indictment
of the writer. The letters fell Into Isson'3
hands and he started to this city to make
things warm for Stierlen.
Arriving here, he was restrained from
doing violence to Stierlen, but caused his
arrest on a charge of sending Improper
letters through the mails. Stierlen plead
ed guilty to the charge In the United
States courts. A fine of Â£W was imposed
for this offense. Not hatisfled with hav
ing cost Stierlen J500 in payment of the
fine, together with attorney's fees and
sundry other expenses, Isson filed a suit
against Stierlen for- heavy damages for
alienation of his wife's affections.
The case was tried before Judge Sander
son, but as it was proved that Mrs.- Isson
was on her way back to her . husband
when she met her death, the court're
fused to accept the plaintiff's theory that
her affections 'had been alienated. Hence
he gave judgment for the defendant. The
letters, which were introduced in evidence,
were I curiosities which the court did not
believe should be permitted to again leave
the Jurisdiction of the court. He conse
quently ordered them impounded and they
are now lying in some dusty recess of
the public vaults. During the hearing of
this case the former Mrs. Stierlen was de
vising ways and means to give Stierlen
a little more trouble before abandoning
him to his happiness with his second wife.
Sha camo to this city and Instituted pro
ceedings for maintenance and support, de
manding $200 a month permanent alimony.
The case has dragged through the courts
for some time and is now on hearing be
fore Judge Hebbard. The rulings and ex
pressions of the court indicate that he Is
not in full sympathy with the decree of
the Dakota Supreme Court setting aside
the* divorce decree. Argument on the.is
sues Involved was not a sufficient basis,
however, for the court to file an opposing
opinion, that the final judj Â«nt of the
California Supreme- Court h ht be ob
tained. Judge Hebbard he Â» ordered
that the facts of the case be .aid before
the* court by way of testimony and docu
mentary evidence.
Mrs. Stierlen was called to the stand at
the opening of the session yesterday
morning.' She testified = that she received
J50U0 in cash and two pieces of property
valued at ?6p00, one bringing in an income
Mrs. Stierlen was on the stand yester
day morning In Judge Hebbard's court
filling out the details of her remarkable
story of the manner in which her hus
band obtained a divorce from her in the
North Dakota courts and how she subse
quently set the decree aside on the ground
of collusion and by so doing made a biga
mist out of her husband, who had mar
ried again. The case had its inception in
this city several years ago. Stierlen tired
of his wife and, according to her storyt
entered Into a collusive agreement with
her, by the terms of which she agreed to
relinquish all claim on his person and
estate without opposition for a considera
tion of $11,000.
George Stierlen, a contractor and builder
of this city and Los Angeles, is in a
"scrape." He has been In others. This
time Judge Hebbard has been called upon
to decide whether the North Dakota Su
preme Court was right when it technically
adjudged him a bigamistâ whether the
first Mrs. Stierlen still has the right to
his support and protection, financial at
least, or whether that is the sole right
of her successor in Siierlen's affections.
After the King is robed, with the Duke
of Devonshire (Lord President of the
Council) carrying the Imperial crown, the
Procession will advance to the House of
Peers, the cap of maintenance being borne
before the King on the right hand of the
alight from tho state carriage and the
procession will move to the robing-room

and officers of the household, flanked by

Privy Seal, the Lord High Chancellor, the
Black Rod, the Garter King-of-Arma, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamber
lain, the sword of. state, carried by the
Marquis of Londonderry; the King and

"No regal diadem rested on the brow
of Abraham Lincoln, no regal robes en
veloped him," said Mr. Shortridge. "We
should be thankful that such a. man was
born In this land, when we consider, had
his hand not been at the helm of the ship
of state when the crisis came, what might
have happened to our now glorious coun
try. Let us do our part in perpetuating
his memory. Let us resolve that this
Union shall be one of undivided States, no
more Mason and Dlxon's line, no bloody
chasm, and that the lields once red with
fratricidal 'carnage will* continue to be
decked with flowers growing under one
constitution and one flag."

opened by the children of the Everett

Little beginnings often lead to great; jresults. The tallest oak
was once a tiny acorn. Many serious diseases have their inceptior
in little ills. Headache, nervousness, indigestion, lost appetite
irritability, worry, anxiety, overwork and lack of sleap seem lit
tie ills but they wear out the nervous strength and destroy thY
vitality of the whole system. A little medicine, if it is the righ;
kind, will do wonders in overcoming: these disorders
" 1 paid no attention to the headaches, nervoua-
ness ancf inability to sleep, but kept right on working
until I wks fiat on my back. I was alct for weeks with
nervous prostration and my doctors did all they could for
me but without avail. Whan I began taking Dr. Miles'
Nervine I gained rapidly until I was well. 1 * *

DENVER, Feb. 12.â The announcement
was mado here to-day for the first time
by Signor Domenlcino Rusbo and Slgnor

husband and wife. As man and wife they
laugh and sing over the footlights as Don
Jose and Carmen. They i were quietly
married In San Francisco five months ago
and now they are singing "Carmen" to
gether here, and Don Jose kisses Carmen
when he pleases, regardless of the lines.
The courtship, they say, lasted four
years. Until last summer Collamarini
was cool toward the tenor and turned her
head and stamped her foot In anger when
he became too persistent. lie followed
her everywhere. They were engaged by
thÂ« Lambardi Italian Opera Company and
traveled through South America and
Mexico. : She finally left the company
hoping to lose him. but he followed her.
She returned to the company, so did
Russo; she ran. so did Russo; she insisted
Russo persisted, po they were married *
To prove that his love has not- been
cooled by marriage, Russo Is madly jeal
ous. When Collamarlni received a bou
quet from an admirer In Victoria, B. C
the dispatches say the tenor struck her
as they were .in the elevator on the way
to their room at a hotel.

McKenzie Must Pay Costs of Trial.
Alexander McKenzIe. ex-receiver of
Nome mines, and now undergoing Im
prisonment for contemm. had more
trouble plle<l upon his head yesterday In
the she*** of an order issued by tho
United "States Circuit Court of Appeals
directing him to pay all the costs of tha
contempt proceedings In the cases of
John I. Tornanses vs. Mousing et al. and
William A. KJellman vs. Henry Rogers.
The order Is based on the faqt that Me-
Kenzie made no settlement with parties
concerned in these cases. The costs
amount to about $1000.
Do the, Russian Government regulations have
euch a bearing upon the facts of the cate as
to bring Russian sugar within the intent of
the said law as disclosed by its terms? While
the question of Its initiative lies with the
administration of the Treasury Department,
the question is of a judicial rather than of
k.n administrative character, and Its import
ance demands determination by a judicial
Uibunal. The Board of General Appraisers
constitutes such a tribunal, and from Its de
cictons appeal may be taken to the. United
States ct#rts. .
As an admlnlsUative officer It Is my duty
to determine questions of doubt in favor of
the Government, the more so that if I err In
that direction the error can be readily cor
rected by a competent tribunal upon protest
and appeal by those adversely affected, while
if by any action the Interests of the Govern
ment are Injuriously affected there is no rem
fn the present case there seems to be no
other proper course than the one you are here
by Instructed to pursue. - It ought to bring the
whole question promptly before a body con
stituted to hear and determine disputed ques
tions of fact and of law. â â¢
ThÂ« Jurisdiction of the Board of General
Appraisers to determine similar questions has
now been sustained by the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, in the case of the
United States vs. the Hills Brothers Company,
decided on February 8, 1901 (unpublished), and
if appeal be taken from my ruling to that
body it will be your duty to facilitate in every
v.ay a prompt and final adjudication of such
appeal. Â¦.Â¦-..Â¦ .
Russia, on the other hand, protests with
great vigor that by no. act of hers Is any
bounty or grant paid or bestowed on the ex
portation of sugar. It Is .represented that
Russian sugar Is sold for export at prices
considerably below the cost of production and
this phenomenon appears to be in some de
giee due to the regulation of the sugar in
dustry of that country by the Russian Gov
ernment.
In the present case the facts are involved
and the conclusions to be drawn from them
are correnporidlngly difficult. At the confer
ence of delegates on the question of sugar
bounties, held in Brussels in June, 1898, the
Belgian and Austrian delegates contended that
the Russian .Government regulations resulted
in an 'ndirect bounty on sugar exported equal
to the difference between the price (exclusive
of excise tax) of sugar sold in that country
for home consumption and the price of cugar
eold for export.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â The Secretary
of the Treasury has imposed a counter
vailing duty of 64 kopecks, or about 32
cents, per pood (a little over thirty-six
pounds) on all refined sugars Imported
into the United States from Russia. Fol
lowing Is the order, addressed to O. L.
Spaulding, assistant secretary in charge
of customs:
You will Instruct collectors and other of
ficers of the customs that in pursuance of tho
provisions of section 5 of the act of July 24,
UÂ»7 the amount of the bounty or rrant paid
or bestowed by Russia on -the export of sugar
is hereby declared to be 64 kopecks per pood
of refined sugar and that an additional duty
equivalent to such amount must be assessed
and collected under said section 5 of the act
of July 24. 1897. .
After Quoting the act the letter pro
ceeds:

It Is now Incumbent upon A. E: Lovett
to resign from the Sari Francisco Fly
Castlng Club. By a vote of 42 to 2 he was
last night found to be an undesirable
member of the organization, and his resig
nation must follow.
Such was the result of the Investiga
tion into the charges made against Lovett
by Walter D. Mansfield, president of the
club. The executive committee had pre
viously decided that Mr. Lovett was In
disfavor, and the meeting held last even
ing in the California Hotel was for the
purpose of voting- on the findings of the
committee. The meetlns was a torrid
one. Several times during the three
hours' session the lie was passed and the
voices of tho members were heard- in
waim debate.
The specific chargos against Lovett
were that he had tamuered with Mr.
Mansfield's .paraphernalia during the.
journey from this city to Chicago, where
Mr. Mansfield was entered to compete In
the championship tournament. Mr. Lov
ett was further charged with unsports
manlike conduct, and he came to ;he
meeting last night ready, he declared, to
disprove the charges. He- was defended
by Merton C." Allen, whose eloquence was
all in vain. The committee had investi
gated the charges veFy thoroughly.
Shortly before midnight a ballot was
taken and the vote stood 42 In favor of the
findings and 2 against them.
Lovett Declared Undisir
able Member by the Fly-
Casting Club.

Jefferson D. Pierce of Washington. D.
C, chief organizer of the American Fed
eration of Labor, met with the Building:
Trades Council of this city to-night tnd
"delivered an exhaustive address upon thÂ«
Importance to labor organisations of a
central and united front. '. : âÂ¦Â¦.".'
In an interview Organizer Pierce said:
"The American Federation of Labor has
been so busy among the great Industrial
centers of the Bast during the last ten
years that the Pacific Coast and the West
ern States have not been given that at
tention which the rapidly increasing in
terests of labor demand.
"The purpose of my tour is to tanr*Â» If
I can upon the men who toil the necessity
of a strong central and representative or
ganization among them. I want to con
vince unorganized labor of the need of or
ganization, and I want to assist In the
v-ork of cementing the labor organiza
tions as they stand.
"Let me say that the feest evidence of
the strength that can be gained from or
ganization.is manifest in the great com
binations of capital. Ten years ago a mil
lion-dollar trust was looked upon as a.
, monstrosity. To-day we have a billton
dollar combination, and what the futnro
has in store for us who can say?
"Capital sees the advantage of combina
tion and leaves nothing undone to ac
complish that end. Tell me, why should
not labor?
"Right here In Oakland I am Informed
that labor is well organized, but we want
to Improve all along the line. The Amer
ican Federation of Labor hopes to place
labor unionism !n its true light before tha
American people. The settlement of labor
differences, not by strikes, but by arbitra
tion along legitimate and sound lines, is
our object. We believe that organization
on this line can be of benefit to the work
ingman. no matter what hl3 trade or his
employment."
Organizer Pierce was given a hearty re
ception this evening by the council. Dar
ing the week he will meet the various
trades ' unions and other labor organiza
tions. On Friday evening there will be a
meeting of the Alameda County Federated
Trades. The labor leaders herÂ© are anx

Captain Robert Simeon, une of the larg
est land owners in Aiameda County, and
a. very prominent resident, died to-day
rather suddenly, though his general
health has bern failing for some time.
He had reached the advanced age of S3
yean, and while he had been tailing
eradualiy for nearly six months the
actual iiiness that resulted in his death
was of les.s than an hour's duration.
Death occurred at his? magnificent home
iii the hills back of Mills College.
Captain Slmson was born In Oumfries,
Scotland, in l^3S. He came to this coun
trj during hii youth and entered Colum
bia College in New York, from which he
graduated and then took a course In the
4 ale OoIU-pe law school, from which he
secured a degree in law. He practiced
In New Ycrk lor some little time, and
then entered the United States Hrmy, se
curing :rt the Mexican War from actual
merit his rank of captain. At the close
ol this war. which secured for the l*nit<*d
ftates nearly all of its possessions on the
1'acUic Ocean, Captain Slmson decided to
come to California. Having helped con
quer this territory he decided to help fet
tje it. and in 1S43 he arrived In San Iran
cipco by a somewhat different route than
that usually taken by the argonauts. He
came overland from Mexico.
Naturally Captain Simson rlunged Into
the prevailing excitement of mining for
cold and made money. He then began
the practice of his profession in fc?an
Francisco, and found ample fortune in
mining law. He was a. c Â«oclated with C
Temp'.e Emmm and M. W. Chittenden at
different times. In 1S6Â« he retired, and
shortly afterward came to Alameda
County and purchased a tract of land
containing several hundred acres in the
hills back of Mill? College. He has lived
there with bis family ever since, making
of his mountain acres a magnificent
country home. He has served for many
jears as a trustee rf Mills College.
Only a few months ago Captain Sim
eon dlpposed of his home :md its broad
ec-res to the Realty Syndicate. This prop
erty was considered a? a possible park
rite for the city of Oakland, but Captain
Simson derided' that he could not afford
to wait until Oakland should make up
its mind to tuy a park and sold to the
rvndicate.
Captain Simpon leaves a wife and two
children. One. a ton. has been mining
in South Africa, but returned home some
time ago because of his father's failing
health. The daughter is the wife of Col
onel Redding, from whom the town of
Reddlne was named. The funeral will

It is very seriously doubted in Chinese

will apree to commit suicide. The army
worships him. He has absolute control of

It is understood that the Chinese pleni
potentiaries In their reply to the court
said the foreign envoys could not object
strongly to an accomplished fact, but
that they would probably insist upon the
rcntenoe of execution being published
throughout the empire, and possibly upon
the heads of those condemned being ex

Fred D. Crane and Fifteen-Year-Old Bessie Wood Leave Oakland
Together and Firs. Crane and Her Two Children Are in Want.
Upon their arrival here they were sent
there by Mrs. Schuyler. Mrs. F. Wet
more, from whom the little family rented
the place, dlscoveredthat they were with
out means, and put herself to much in?
convenience to make the place as com
fortable as possible. The husband was
out of employment and temporary work
was given him by Mrs. Wetmore's rela
tives! He earned enough to keep the fam
ily In food. His rent was due and- the
Wetmores did not press him for it, hop
ing that the husband would soon be In
easier circumstances.
Mrs. Crane had lived in Oakland for
several years before her marriage to' the
young Englishman at Grays, in March,
1S97. She was living with her younger sis
ter on a ranch belonging to their mother
at the time of the marriage. Crane came
there and the acquaintance ended in thi
union.
It was determined a short time ago to
send the younger sister back to California
for her health. According to the state
ments which Mrs. Crane made to the Wet
mores, there was a suspicion that Crane
had formed an attachment for his buxom
young sister-in-law because he at once de
cided that he would come to California.
That led to the migration of all the
family.
Crane had little or no money when he
departed. So far as the wife ascertained,
he had nothing but the few dollars he
raised by secretly selling a sewing ma
chine that was among their few posses
sions.
rf***: AKLAND, Feb. 12.â The story of
nf \\ a young wife's cruel abandon-
II II ment by a husband who eloped
with her 15-year-old sister was
related to-day to Chief of Police
Hodgkins by Mrs. Harriet M. Crane, who,
with her runaway spouse, Fred D. Crane,
the eloping sister, Miss Bessie Wood, and
the Crane's two babies, arrived here a
month ago from Grays, Idaho.
The desertion and elopement have left
the distracted woman destitute with one
of her children, a boy of three years, suf
fering, from pneumonia. The other child
is a girl one year old.
Chief Hodgkins has taken personal
charge of the case, which, he declares,
appeals to him as one of the saddest that
has ever been brought to his attention.
Mrs. Crane has been compelled to seek
shelter at the home of a sister, Mrs. C.
A. Schuyler, residing at 1562 Market street.
The shock has been so severe that, her
relatives fear she will break down under
the strain. â¢
The accused husband, who i3 24 years
old. and his gtfrl companion disappeared
simultaneously Sunday morning'. , That
they ran away together has been satis
factorily settled bo far as the wife is con
cerned. In her report to the police Mrs.
Crane said that early Sunday morning
her husband said he would go out for a
walk. An hour later the sister' went out,
making the same remark. Since then
nothing has been seen of either Crane or
the fflrl.
The Cranes had been living in . a little
cottage at the rear of 565 Eleventh street.

The Humboldt Steamship Company's
Humboldt will come out of retirement to
morrow. She will at once go into com

The rush of freight for the Ventura has
been something enormous during the last
twenty-four hours. Monday night a string
of laden wagons extended from the ferry
to Pacific Etreet, and yesterday evening
the line still extended from Washington
to Pacific In a. double row. The Ventura
will get away to-morrow night at 9

The old schooner Lily L, that for a
couple of winters served as an ark for
Donald Ross at Sausalito. is burled under
fourteen feet of Ice near Cape Xome, and
she may go to pieces In the spring. The
Lily L was formerly a sealer, but latterly
has been on a trading cruise to the Sibe
rian coast. Making Cape Nome she was
carried down by the tide and struck on
the stem of the tug Discovery. She sank,
and before any attempt could be made to
raise her the cold wave came and she waa
frozen in. . . , : .-^

The Mohican will take aboard about 250
apprentices here, and when everything Is
ready will start on a cruise to the South

San Diego, Magdalena Bay and Honolulu.
On her return to San Francisco she will
go north, calling at all the Puget Sound
ports and stopping on the Columbia River
on her way home. Most of the voyaging}
will be done under sail, but the Mohican
has steam power that la calculated to
drive her at the rate of nine knots an
hour. '
â¢ The United States training ship Mohican
Is down from Mare Island, and while to
all appearances she Is the same old-timer,
nevertheless there is not an old timber
left In her, and the sloop-of-war Is now
as good as the day she was launched.
Bark-rigged and presenting an appear

famous ships of the old days, she is one
of the most picturesque vessels in the bay.

MOHICAN IS GOOD AS NEW.
Just as day Â¦was breaking the deserters
were sighted. Their boat was under sail,
but when -they saw the other boat coming
they at 'once got out the oars and pulled
with their utmost strength. Captain
Munro caught ihem as they were making
a landing, but told them to keep on mov
ing, as all he wanted was his boat and the
ship's compass. Yesterday "the men
reached San Francisco, footsore and
weary- They are without money, and
some of them would be glad to bo back
on the Borealls again. "
About ten minutes after the men had
got away. Captain Munro came on deck
and walked aft to see how the schooner
was heading. When he found the com
pass gone and then, missed one of the
boats' be knew what was the matter and
called " all remaining hands. With three
hunters and a boat steerer he got into an
other boat and started in pursuit, after
telling the mate to-head the schooner In
shore. /
The British sealing schooner Borealls
has had a good season off the coast, but
still the men did not like the vessel, and
they were willing to forfeit ihelr "lay" If
they could only get ashore. Five of them
bribed the night watchman, and one night
last week -while the* schooner was off Fort
Ross they stole on* of the ship's boats
and the ship's compass and started for the
shore.
They Run Away With Schooner's Boat and
Compass, but Are Overtaken as They Are
Beaching Craft Near Fort Ross.

I>r. Kodley's Case Argued.
Argument in the case of Dr. J. Ellis
Rodley. ex-Mayor of Chico, convicted In
the Superior Court of perjury, was heard
before Chief Justice Beatty' of the Su
preme Court yesterday and the case was
taken under advisement.
Officer Deely Loses Star.
The Police Commissioners met last night
and as a result of their deliberations a
number of licenses were granted, one of
ficer lost his star and another was fined
$100. Officer Deely was the unlucky one,
his star being taken from him on account
of previous complaints and a final charge
of reporting- off late and being intoxicated.
Officer Patrick Butler lost his month's sal
ary through his failure to report an at
tempted burglary.
A remarkable case' of asphyxiation oc
curred in a residence at 529 Stevenson
street, near Sixth, yesterday. In which a
boarder, William Millark. suffered death
and- another boarder named John Dresch
was so overcome that at a late hour last
night his" life was despaired of; The fam
ily of William Ervin, consisting of his
wife, two sons and a daughter, were also
overcome, but were removed in time to
prevent fatal consequences.
The strange part of the affair is that
in the house there are no gas fixtures,
the presence of the deadly vapor being
due to a leak' in the gas main in the
street, through which tne gas escaped
and entered tne house through the 'sewer
pipe,' in whlcn there was also a leak.
Another strange feature is the fact that
those who suffered mostly from the In
halation of the monoxide roomed on the
feecond floor, llils is accounted for by the
fact that the gas rose to the floor above
the entrance ot the sewer pipe and gath
ered there.
When the presence of the fluid was first
discovered tne matter was reported, but
no attention was paid' to the complaint.
The family, tearing no serious conse
quences, paid no further attention to the
matter and retired to rest at the usual
time. Shortly afterward Mrs. Ervln be
came very ill and had to be carried out
Into the open air before she recovered.
Erv'ln, though scarcely able to stand,
summoned his, eldest son, William Ervln,
and both went to Investigate the cause of
groans coming from other rooms.
After breaking: open the doors they
found Millark and I I>resch unconscious.
The police were immediately notified and
the two unfortunate men were .removed
to the Receiving Hospital, where every
thing 'possible was done to resuscitate
them.
Mlllark died last night at 8:3(S but at a
late hour the efforts to restore Dresch
had met with little success.
Mlllark was about 19 years of age, and
was employed by Strode '& "Westerfeld.

PRINCE CARNIVAL
FORMS HIS COURT
Charlis \ Dickman Perfeots
Plans for the Mardi
Gras Ball.
In spite of the mask prohibition at the
bal masque at Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art next Tuesday evening. Bohemia is
promising itself a pretty good time. Bo
hemia's Interest* are In the competent
hands of one of their number, and no less
a personage than Prince Carnival, other
wise known as Charles M. DIckman, art
ist. Mr. Dickman' has planned a hlghly
origlnal and what promises to be a most
successful opening ceremony for ye gay
carnival. Though the gentleman is by
no, means forward, he has not the least
intention of having his first parliamen
tary effort lost in the confusion which
has invariably greeted the opening
speeches of the former Princes of Carni
val at these artistic festivals; therefore
will sweet harmony be programmed to
assist. A chorus of twelve good members
of Bohemia will proclaim the approach of
royalty to the Carnival. The herald, not
yet appointed, will chant his customary
command of silence to the revelers, and
the King himself will wield a good bari
tone in his maiden throne speech. The
musical arrangements are in the capable
charge of WrfHace A. Sabln. F. C. O., and
It is expected this feature will add much
to the beauty and gayety of the affair.
Prince Carnival will be clad in the us
ual courtly fashion, with more than the
usual color about the costume. A mag
nificent mantle, white silk tights, and
what Mr. Dickman describes as a blue
silk "corsage," will be its chief features.
One McKlnnon, with no other discover
able cognomen than "Blnky," will serve
ns jester for the evening, and'a favorite
Bohemian, with a serviceable baritone, is
mentioned as the probable ' herald. The
decorations are , to -ibe 'as novel as the
opening ceremony,;, and are coming on
apace. For the. first time In bal masque
annals of. the Institute, floral and other
vegetable decorations will . be in the
ascendant. Some brilliant lighting effects
on the opening. pageant are planned, and
the halls- am now- a particolored and
hopeless mass of red. and yellow bunt
ing. Chinese, lanterns, electric wires, be
lated landscapes, carnival beraldry. and
all the other gallant prophecies â¢ of the
gay. good time coming for Tuesday even-'

The ladies of the San Francisco Protes
tant Orphan Asylum Society held their
annual business meeting in the guild room
of Trinity Episcopal Church yesterday
afternoon. The meeting was called to or
der by the president of the society, Mrs.
William Alvord, after which occurred the
reading ofthe reports of the secretary and
the treasurer and the election of officers
for the ensuing year.
The secretary'. Mrs. Frederick MacCrel
lish, gave in her report a brief history of
the work of the society since Its Inception,
exactly llfty years ago, together with the
statistics for the last year. The charity
had a very small beginning, in humble
surroundings, with only, a few destitute
children, but since 1S54, when State aid
was first given and when the asylum was
moved to Its present site, the growth of
means has been steady and the work
most successful.
In the* history of the society 3516 home
less orphans have been cared for, andj
with few exceptions, have proved In after
life the. benefits of their early training.
During the last year 259 children have
been received into the asylum, of whom
there remain 165. Improvements are be
ing made constantly and everything pos
sible is being done for the mental and
physical welfare of the Inmates.
A touching tribute was paid to the mem
ories of Alrs.C. V. Glllesple of the society
and Albert Shaw of the trustees, who have
passed away dvrlng the year. Mrs. Gil
lespie was one of. the founders and char
ter members, and throughout her life was
always constant and faithful in her de
votion to the cause. . The society sus
tained an irreparable loss In her death
The report of Mrs. Kirkham Wright,
the secretary, showed that $34.087 04 had
been spent during the year on the various
features of the work, leaving a balance
on hand over the income of $758 62.
The reports were accepted unanimously,
and the wish was expressed that the pub
lic visit the asylum and observe .the
methods of work. .The meeting then pro
ceeded to the election of officers for the
ensuing year, which resulted as follows:
President, Mrs. William Alvord: first vice
president, Mrs. William Ashburner; sec
ond vice president, Mrs. C. O. Gerberding*

ORPHAN ASYLUM
LADIES MEET
Lcs Angeles Has No Redress.
The Railroad Commissioners, at the reg
vlar monthly meeting yesterday, read the
opinion of Attorney General Tirey L,. Ford
in referer.ee to the protest of the I/is
Anprfles Traffic Association against the
Southern Pacific Oornr>any.
The complaint was filed the latter part
of last year and the Las Angeles Traffic
Af-Fcciation then argued that the distance
from Visalia to I>os Ang-eW and from VI
t t'.'.r. to San r"raneisco were the sam.e,
but the freight rate from Visalia to Ijos
In Attorney General Ford's written
opinion the complaint is insufficient and
advises that no action should be taken by
the R,allroad Commissioners.
The hearing of thÂ« case in reference to
the abandonment of the track by the
Santa. F*e between In^lewood Junction and
Santa Monica was laid over until April 9.
Angeles was 27 cents per hundred pounds
while to San Francisco the rate was only
6*5 cents. The complainants alleged that
there was discrimination shown.
A warrant was Issued yesterday by
Judg^ Cabajiiss on the complaint of Man,
Sadler & Co.. wholesale grocers, for the
arrest of E. Strauss, one of their outside
salesmen, on a charge of felony embezzle
ment. He is accused of collecting $427 7*

Horace Cl. Platt. thÂ»- well-knovrn attor

t?r> next president of the Pacific Improve

The position is at present held by
Georpe Crocker, but the latter has given
".;p his refejdrncf In 1Mb city and now lives
in Xew York. Plait is the coast repre

hence believed that the directors will
make- Platt president of the company.
The salary of the president is SIO.OCO a

Mr. Platt stated last ovonlns that he
Y.r.i not been notified of the appointment,
but that he was iÂ«<Â» representative of
General Iltibbsrd on thÂ«Â» roast. Should ft
be tendered him. no said, he would cer
tainly accept the presidency.
RIVAL claimants and opposing lit
igants occupied adjoining: apart
ments In the offices of the Vulcan
Smelting and Kenning Company
yesterday. Young Partridge and
Attorney CochranÂ© secured an entrance
to the offices at 306 Pine street early- in
the day. They occupied one room, while
Frank W. Page, his wife Lillian, who is
alleged to have exerted sufficient hypnotic
or other influence over Partridge to se
cure the making of a will In favor of her
self and husband, and Secretary Harry
L. Baker occupied another apartment.
Partridge and Attorney Cochrane went
over such books as they could obtain and
claimed at the close of the day's work to
have secured Indisputable evidence of
fraud, as set forth in their complaint.
"The transfers of stock to third parties
Is one of the most peculiar features In the
case," said Attorney Savage of counsel
last night. "Our developments to-day
were of a startling character, but we are
not prepared to make our discoveries pub
lic as yet. We have learned enough for
us to say that a series of criminal actions
will follow."
Neither Page nor his wife would make
a statement. Both were uneasy In their
demeanor. Secretary and Treasurer Ba
ker was likewise uncommunicative.

The stabling of William Walker on
Ellis street, near Powell, Monday night
is surrounded by mystery. Mllo Waldron.
formor proprietor of the Majestic saloon,
Â¦was arrested yesterday morning:, it being
supposed that he committed the crime,
and was charged with an assault with
intent to commit murder. He was sub
sequently released on furnishing J200 cash
ball as Walker la not as seriously wound
td as was lirst reported.
Wnldro:i says that he was in hi5 home

\\'a!krr refuses to divuipe the name of his
ossa!la:it. There thÂ« matter rests.
The police authorities are not making
any attempt to unravel the mystery. It
Is more than probable that th* charge
will ho dismissed, for when Walker was
arrested last November for cutting Wal
<iron there was nu prosecution. The
friends of Walker say, however, that
when he is abl*> to leave the hospital he
will Either kill Waldron or get killed iiim
*">lf.
Notwithstanding the fact that Walker

f . *VP in December, 1S39. I was taken
'liR a *Â»ck wltn Black Typhoid Fever.
fTJ; y the roost vlTUlent type known to
lÂ£2 Jl. medical science. I had hemor-
JtdÂ»Â» rhas^s. both nasal and lnteatl-

Â»#/rS.VjVj|A Woo. the eminent Chines* phy-
sician was called, and with onj dose of his
tea Â»toppÂ«4 the flow ct blood, thereby savins
my life, a* I had- been given up by my .white
physician, as well as by all my friends. Was
unconscious four weeks, but by Dr. Wons Woo*s
wonderful skill he saved my life trom this most
fatal of all fevers. Although I was confined to
my bed three months, was able to resume my
vocation In Â«lx months from the time I went to
bed. and now I weigh 203 pounds, more than I
had ever attained previously. I would cheerfully
recommend Dr. "Won* Woo to any one In need
of a first-class physician for any cause whatso-
