makers, according t6 history, were two
.old crones In the Swiss" Mountains. They
gathered and brewed herbs for a precari

they â¢Â¦ found thaU brewed wormwood was
good for fevers. They gathered the leaves
and flowering tops mixed, them with va
rious other aromatic plants, and pounded
the mass! , Th* bruised particles were af
terward'covered with alcohol and soaked
for eight day3. A green llqUor was- then
distilled/ to- which, a' certain percentage
of anise Feed .oil was, addod. These old
women sold the absinthe, roughly brewed,
to their customers strickpn with' fever.

dazed absinthe victim and politely an

and with thair assistance a caiiows wu
erected on the chandelier.
Meanwhile the band had disappeared
As soon as the executioner announced
that the callows was ready, the music
was again heard approaching In the dis

a funeral march. It marched, in solemn! v,
followed by two pigmy prisoners heavily

up vigorously, "See, tho Conriuerins Hero

Alfred D. Musset, the famous poet, was
another victim of ;h^" fe!l destroyer. Reg
ularly, night afier ni&nt, he went to the
cafe and consumed .Â¦lass after s.ass of
the green liquor, whica he frequently sai-l
was dragging him to in early deaih. Fin

green terror and was often picked up un

Am^lif may he Been r at T her dally plunge,
l^a^fng a fashion that others try to copy

is a swimmer par excellence. If she had
happened to be born in another phase of
life Fhe -would have turned out a prize
diver to r-<? exhibitor. As it is. she swims
for pleasure, not for profit, and an ad
miring crowd always gathers on the
beach when she appears on the porch of
the royal bathhouse. Dozens of field
glasgpg are leveled, at her. for everybody
has heard of the way she swims on her
Fide and the way she floats and the way

"She moves !n water like a cat on dry
land," a traveler says. "She glides and
slides, and you can't. tell exactly how she
movfc?, but she goes surprisingly fast.
"And graceful! There Isn't a fish in the
seven seas that looks more at his case,
out for a stroll In the water. She looks
back and laushs at the court ladles" who
grasp behind her. trying to keep up."
The royal palace at Cascaes, Felix
Trigucro says, is a summer residence on
a large scale. Around it and as near as
Its -royal dignity permits are other sum
mer homes of Portugal's swelldom. For
then there are bathhouses along the
beach. . For the royal family a bathhouse
has bfen built about half a mile out in
the water, and the royal bathers are
rowÂ«d back and forth between It and the
beach. Â¦ ,
Tliis bathhouse is a little island all by
Its-elf. It stands high upon a foundation
of piles, and is a brightly colored dot on
the big, blue water. The Queen likes
cheerful colors, and she is said to have
ordered the painting of the bathhouse.
Year after year the Queen spends her
ummers at Cascaes, and every summer
day sees her in the water. Her swim
ming is only one of her many accomplish
ments to the world. It does not surprise
her people much, for they expect her to
do something clever. She has always
been doing clever things ever since Don
Carlos brought her home with him to the
Lisbon palace. She capped the climax,
however, when she paved Catalao's life.
It was on a day when she had hesitated
a little about going- to the bathhouse.
"It .looks threatening above," 8 he said,
thinking out loud, as she stood by the
â¢window. An ugly colored cloud had
sneaked in front of the sun and made the
sky look dreary. ~
"It appears to be much too threatening
for your Majesty to trust herself out
of doors." put in a lady of the court, one
Â«;ho is always poking in her oar like a
fussy grandmother. That settled it.
"No risk whatever," sa!d the Queen.
"I shall go. Suppose I do get wet. what
rf It? Won't I dry? To be sure I will.
FuppoFe the waves are heavy? What
cf that? All the more fun swimming.* I
shall be able to keep my head, above the
vater. never fear. And all the ladies will
try to keep up,' and they will bo slapped
In the face by the rough waves and they
â¢will have to go back to the bathhouse.
Won't you. ladles?" she cried tauntingly,
and 'off she -went with a laugh and gave
her maid orders to make her ready.
The maid was Immensely pleased,
though she had to look like a 'sphinx."*
Ebe liked her tall, bright-eyed Queen, and
what she especially llk^d was her spirit
At social functions she is, thÂ« life of the
company. In her hbm"; lifp Bhn is a ruler
without need of title. IhtMftr" sports Â«h9

her. " * . "'Â¦ - ' - .';â¢'.;
By the time tho: royal rowboat; pushed
away from shore theugjy little cloud had
slipped 'away from the ; sun and the
weather looked more' hopeful. The fussy
court lady- was '.dit-appolh ted because. .it
looked as if she '. would have- no : chance

Jose Catalao wae thefinan,who rowed
her out to the bathing place.' lie always
is the man. He has been employed us
the Queen's boatman. for a long. time, for
lie is trustworthy and the Quefen is loyal
to any servant who is loynl- tr) her. ' So
while Catalao is a good and willing boat-
inan.hr knows that np. man can take his
place. He was pretty sure of this before,
much surer now since the; famous rescue.
Jose has. a family living, in 'Caseaes.
They are poor, but what they, have from
his income is sure. -'During the -season
when royalty shines * in the Ushnn pal
ace Jose picks up all ; sort3 of jobs about*
town and his wife takes in washing some
times. The whole family are - so Â¦ pÂ» oud -
ot having Jose work for the Queen that
once'hiiJ wife refused a high-priced wash
ing . from one of her neighbors ; because
the neighbor's husband merely owned a
boathouse on the beachâ one which roy
alty did not patronize, although the boat
man's income was three times as large
as Jose's.
Before Jose. pushed off on the day of
the. accident 'he remarked i that there
would' be a rough sea 'soon.' â¢
"The cloud has passed," *aid the Queen.
"Yes, H'our Majesty; but: the^ water
grows dark and there are flecks, of 'foam
on the waves." : . .
"Are you afraid, Jose?" questioned the
Queen ln.her most withering .inflection./'
But Jose knew his sovereign too well. to
be withered. He ywas only.dclighted'at
the implication j that sho was not afraid.
He tried to'aecept the reproof with -/ a
properly humble bow, but a twinkle of en-
joyment would Bteal into his eyes,' despite
his efforts, and the dimple next: to the
corner of his ! mouth would show. - . Some

both laughed together. -~\

The Queen was in glorious spirits.' She
liked the way the boat '--J rocked : and the
boatman pulled.- " - When shft got on her
bathing suit she, ran laughing 'out upon
the veranda and called to all who darcd'to
_ follow her. Tho ladies- dipped squeamish
ly into the.w.aves. . Some struck out, but
all gave up after a few strokes.
Never had Amelie --swum so daringly.
She was more Iove.lv. in the water than
ever before. ' She' frolicked* like a dolphin,
laughed in. the-facje' qfÂ»*cvery wave that
grew, bold and kefit sufficient .breath to

So for a splendid 'half; hour she played

'-'It's getting, cold,*' 'she cried at last,
feeling a sudden chill of incoming water.
-' She swam relucta'ntfy backto the hou.<e.
Catalao was anxiously, watching sky and
water.
"J6se is still fearful," she said with a
taunting little shrug as she passed into
her apartments.
When - she came out she was dressed
warmly, even heavily.; Sliehadan extra
wrap about her shoulders;. for the air had

HAD FUN WITH
A GRIZZLY
THE best bear hunt that 1 have ever
participated in took place In the
northern nart of Sisklyou County.
Thfre verÂ«? two grizzlies that caused
the farmers a treat deal of trouble and
succeeded in petting away with the be?t
beef in the whole country. After many
unsuccessful attempts to kill them ths
valley put its heads together and made a
jilan tu catch Messrs. Grizzly.
One of them was killed by a half-breei
and the other took many of us on a Ion-?
chase. We selected a place that was fre
quented by hi-? royal highness and put a
trap under the water In such a fashion
that It could not be seen. To one end
of it we fastened a tre* about twenty
feet long, and a good heavy one at that.
Immediately over the whole affair v.-e
placed a tempting p!ece of meat, and then
wont home well pleased with our day'.s
v.ork.
The next morning bright and rarly v:c
were all out well armed and with every
available dos in the territory. When wo
reached the place where wp h:n;l placed

friend had been there before us. Trap.
bait and bear were all gone, but a heavy
cut showed us his :euie.
We thought he couldn't possibly go
over a few miles, but we found out to our
sorrow that few thiriRs will stop a griz
zly when he has made up his mind to take
a trip.
On and on we wont, until we reached a
place where two fallen trees attracted our
attention. From appearances we knew
that the bear tried to get between them,

W. L. PRATHER
TELLS QUITE A
GOOD ONE.
- t? HAVE heard dozens of good bear
stories that discount mine all to pieces.
][ but I will tell you what I consider my
most exciting experience.
It happened about sÂ»x years ago. when
I was hunting . in the northern part of
this State. One day I took a young dog
out, thinking that I would see if he could
do anything. We loitered along through
the woods and as there didn't seem to be
ar.y game about I decided to go home.
Just about that t!nic the dog commenced
to bay and started tor a small tree only
a few yards away. I couldn't see a thing,
ond after calling him several times gava
him a good thrashing for being so per
sistent. But it didn't seem to take tha
idea out of his heaJ and he kept jumping
around like a crazy creature.
I wondered if thi-re was anything up
there and commenced to poke a piece oC
mistletoe. A queer noise rewarded ma
and I found a cub hidden m the branches.
It Jook but a few minutes to finish him.
and Iras ttlclng ray time, when I heard
a noise behind me th^t caused mo to turn
about in a Hurry.
The old bear was coming at a furious
rate. It was too late for me to aim at
her. so I went around the tree In a ruah
with the bear In close pursuit and the
dog after the beax. We made a rapl.l
trio. I have often laugued at the pictura
we must have- presented. Round an-1
round we flew until tha dirt went In all
directions and I was sa dizzy that I could

HENRY E. HIGHTON HAD A RATHER
DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE ONCE.
T? N fifty years I have met with but few
dramatic experiences in the woods. I
ii have listened to many bear stories in
front of camp fires, but most of thorn
easily surpassed any dangers or embar
rappmerits I have ever encountered.
I remember but one incident in my hunt
ing that is worth recalling, and that is
trifiirg compared to the reminiscences of
others. About thirty-two years ago I was
after deer at a point nearly sixty miles
nnrthwcFt from Lakeport. I carried a
Spencer rifle, which held seven cartridges
when the macarine was full.
My companion was an old Rooky Moun
tain tra;jj>er of unquestionable courage
and experience. About sundown. I skirted
the he*6 of a canyon $illÂ«';d with email
trees and brush, near the top of a ridge.
1 had but one cartridge left In my gun.
Suddenly, at a distance of about forty
yard?, a grizzly emerged from the brush
and confronted me.
It was in the month of June and the
bear v.as very lean. and. in places, the
hair was rubbed off from his hide. He
weighed then. I should Judge, about 600
iwur.ds, but if Jt had been October cr No
vpmber, after the mast had fallen, his
weight would have been probably double.
When I first saw him he was feeing mr-,
and without time to reflect I fired my last
cartridge at him and struck him In the
mus-iles of the breast. He bawled and
xnaae straight for me. ' .*â¢"Â£Â¦Â¦
My*comnanion, who had a good muzzle
leader, ran away, and from that day to
this I have never seen him. My opinion
is that he was stampeded, as I have seen
cattle and buffaloes stampeded on tho
plains, and that when he reached the
camp he was so ashamed of his desertion
that he did not like to meet me. At any
rate, when I got there he was gone an<l
had taken his horse and h!s blankets whh
him.
To return to the bear. Of course, I had
to stand my ground, although, if the op
portunity had been given me. I could have
made fa.st time.
Fortunately, in the hip pocket of my
hunting trousers I had a Colt's navy re
volver, and when he was within eight or
ten feet of me 1 Hred directly inhis face
without really taking aim. The ball hap
pened to strike him in the left eye an 1
penetrated his brain. He dropped almost
at my feet and I cut off his claws and
tail and left with gratitude in my heart
for so lucky an escape.
This is the only bear story I know.

days, medicinal pprings. sanitariums for
the Â»Â«fnicted. tig trees that rival those of

From Los Angeles to Saugus. for the
present, the trains of the coast line will
follow the beaten track. When the great
tunnels in the Chatsworth Park cut-off
are finished the old line will be left at
Burbank, only a few miles north of Los
Angeles. From Saugus to San Buena
ventura there Is little to interest the
Fightseer. but from that point on as far
as Ellwood there is a succession of lemon
groves In the highest state of cultiva
tion. Dotted here and there in the end
less field cf green and yellow are little
villages and towns, all of modern build,
the red roofs of the cottages adding color
and life to the beauty of the landscape.
Kllwood has been the northern terminus
of the coast line for a number of year*.
From that point to Surf,' distant flfty-3.x
and two-tenths miles by rail, It was be
lieved impossible to build a road. Frown-
Ing mountains came jliruptly down to the
sea. affording practically no facilities for
grading a roadbed, and ten years ago it
was not even dreamed possible that a
continuous line wouid ever traverse tlw
rugged slopes and deep ravines and can
yons which have new been conquered. It
was the dream of Colhs P. i.untlngton's
life to fee this read /'put through, bir.
death claimed him bef.Jre his scheme was
realized. From Santa Barbara, one of the
oldest and prettiest little cities on th.)
Pacific Coast, to Point Conception the
coast line runs almost due wesÂ». It would
seem that at some former period the foot
hills which elsewhere give gradual ap
proach to the coast ranrt" had here been
swallowed up by the Eea. Towering
mountains rise directly from the' boiling
surf and to precipitous arc their sid<?Â«t
at places that engineering skJU has been
taxed to Its utmost to find a foothold for
the road. . - >.
A series of immense ileel viaducts, how
ever, have biidged the canyons between
the mountains; tunnels and deep cuts, in
volving enormous expenditure of money
and labor, have solved the problem aud
this fifty-six miles of roadbed now com
pleted is perhaps the most costly -bit of
railroad on the Pacific Coast, not except
ing the famed Tehachapi. miltage being
equal. The road from Santa Barbara to
Ellvood. although originally constructed
(several years ago. has boen rebuilt, the
curves straightened and ihe grades equal

From Cement*>rla to Gavlota th<Â»re is a

Through trains will be running early In
February. The daylight run will cover
the distance from San Francisco to Santa
Barbara.' and the running time to Los
Angeles for regular trains will be four
teen - hoars. Material changes will ba
made in through train arrangements, al
though the officials have not determined
at this date just 'what these changes will
be.- In â¢ all - probability - the overland to
and -from New Orleans will nse the new
line, and in addition there will be express
train service and local trains between San
Francisco and Los Angeles. The new
road means much to the eommercfa!
world, as it opens up a new territory for
through business, ami' will enable produc
ers In Santa Clara. Monterey, San Luis
Obispo and. Santa. Barbara counties to
more , promptly market i their commodities
as well as to . compete with their more*
favored; brethren In the San Joaquln and
Sacramento valleys, who have -been on
trunk lines of railroads forbears;. â -
At Felton. Boulder. Ben Lomond. Glen
wood and other stations on. this line, sum
mer resort hotels abound and everv at
traction that magnificent mountain resorts
can offer are at the tourist's disposal.
The de3ceiit from the mountains toward
the Santa Clara Valley is gradual and th4
scenery is grand. When the valley is
reached tr-c traveler enters a succession
of gardens, prune groves, apricot orchards
and vineyards reaching almost to. the
hills that surround San Francisco. It is
California's garden spot with something
new, something grand, something attrac
tive to see at every turn.
Between San Jose and San Francisco the
road la well known. No changes have yet
been made, but the tunnel.-* now being
driven through the hills at South San
Francisco, when completed, will shorten,
the line somewhat and straighten it not
a little. :
The line front Santa Cruz to San JosÂ»Â«
Is claimed by many to be the most pictur
esque piece of road controlled bv the
Southern Pacific. The Santa Cruz Moun
tains are abrupt and rugged and afford
a panorama â¢ of mountain scer.ery un
equaled on the* coast. At Ble Tree Sta
tion, only a few miles from Santa Cruz,
some of thÂ« largest of California's bis
trees are to b* found and at various points
of the Santa. Cruz line forests Â«f giant red
woods are passed through. Some of these
latter are from twelve to fifteen feet In
dinmetrr, BsBHHtt
bridges and viaducts all Indicate that the"
new road is built not only for heavy
travel, but for speed as well.
An hour's run north, from San Luis
Oblspo and Paso Robles la reached. Hero
has been erected a magnificent sanitarium
and hotel at a cost of nearly a quarter
of a million dollars, uhere are medicinal
springs to the number of a score or more,
whose waters are said to cure many of
the Ills of mankind. At Santa Ysabel.
three miles away, there are other springs
of similar character, but the place la still
undeveloped. A few miles farther on la
tÂ»e little hamlet of San Miguel, with It3
old mission, still In excellent preservation
and used as a place of worship to this day.
Beginning here and extending as far north,
as King City there are numerous oil fields
under process of development, and the dis
trict promises to become a factor In the
oil world at .no far distant day. Thence
northward the tourist is whirled throushi
the great sugar beet fields of California.
AH the way to Salinas the land is rich
and level and devoted almost entirely to
beets and craln. Â¦ The largest beet sugar
plant In the world Is located near Sal'ias.
The industry Is gaining In volume every
year and the acreage to be seeded to beets
this year Is fully one-third larger than has
heretofore been applied to that purpose.
From Castroville. a few miles abovÂ»
Salinas, tourists will be taken direct to
Monterey and Hotel del Monte, one of the
finest summer and winter- resorts In the
world. Hotel del Monte has been so much
written about that It Is comparatively
well known, but Pacific Grove, which lies
near it on the point and which Is the
Chautauqua of the West, will become
much more favorably known now that it
Is on a direct through line of travel. The
bay of Monterey !a a fisherman's para
dise, and from the fact that In it are
found almost every variety of fish In the
Pacifc Is known as Nature's aquarium.
On the northern : point of the bay Is the*
little cityfs of Santa Cruz, resembling a.
New England town of five thousand. It
abounds In place* of Interest to visitors.
cut Immediately after leaving the biff
l>ii<ir,t., j>.u v,i.er. a' curve .s roundeu.
away off across miles of moving water,
the sun shining upon Its whitened walls,
is seen the Point Conception lighthouse.
Apparently It stands upon a peninsula
that juts far cut into the sea. but this is
caused by me fact that the train makes
an abrupt turn iiist,at this point, winding
around the mountain side. Near Agua
Callente the mountain range seems to di
vide, and a canyon of great width and
depth is spanned by another of those tre
mendous viaducts. 'With no support visi
ble from the Interior of the car, the tour
ist is whirled across this abyss, a hundred
feet in the air, with nothing in view be
low but a narrow strip of sand and the
rearing surf of the Pacific. To describe
this .succession of mountains, cuts, fills
and viaducts would be redundant. No
one can remember them all in a single
trip, nor a half-dozen for that matter.
They are all intt-reftlng and each one
fhows sorao new beauty of sea or mpun
tain to chain the attention of the pas
senger. Jt may be of interest to note,
however, that on; of the largest railway
fills in thÂ» world is found on this line. It
is near Cajo. ThÂ» length of the fill Is
nbout lfOO fe^t. height 74 feet and It re
quired 275.C00 cubic yards of earth and
rock to build it. Another fill at Gold Tree
station contains 24S.C00 cubic yards. An
other item of no small account is the
bridge that crosses the Santa Maria Riv
er. It is composed of seven spans and is
12*50 feet long. To. complete the 56.2 miles
cf new road in the sixteen months that
have been required to build It an average
. forre of 3000 horses and a corresponding
number of men have* been constantly em
ployed. ; ' . .
" At -Surf, where, the new track joins the
old. one of the finest marine views in the
world is to be seen. All the currents of
the sea appear, bent upon coming ashore
at this point, and it is said to be impos
sible.for any living thing to swim in the
turbulent waters. Surf is at present an
enterprising: town of :. three or four in
habitants^ in addition to the railway lm
ployes'stationed there. â¢ The most im
portant'Individual is a white bull dog,
and his owner is next in public esteem.
The. buildings of the Southern Pacific
Company â¢ are substantial : and . commodi
ous, but -aside .from these, two or three
shacks and a saloon .comprise the .town.
As soon as the regular, traffic of the road
Is under way.' however. Surf promises to
become' a -place of "some- importance as
th^re Is, some good- farming country just
"to the north of It.. The- new Government
lighthouse at Point Arguello is visible
from this place. '
".The 'immediate coast line is followed
toward the north from Â»Surf to Â¦within a
few miles of San Luis * ooisp'u. The same
magnificent land and marine. views. obtain
nearly â¢ all the way, but- when the valley
south of San. Luis.Obispo is .entered the
sea -Is left ~ and the tourist Ms afforded an
entire change. San Luis Obfspo is one of

"I find myself growing very curious
about this remarkable young lady," said
Lorrimer to. himself. " 'Not sick/ Grey
says, 'but fanciful; not yet recovered from
the shock of Ned Glover's death, though
bho finds the change Is doing; her good.'
A woman' in ten thousand, ; evidently.
Writes a capital letter,* well-educated, and
has quite a pretty way of turning a sen
tence; a fine bold hand, too! Poor Ned, to
arrive, with wealth and beauty and every
. thing a man can desire, and be wrecked
in port! It makes one's heart bleed. Won
der how much the young lady is, like her
cousin? Grey Bays she is very like him. An
odd thing for Grey to say, when he hasn't
- an"atom of vanity; and Zella Brunnen Is a
beauty! Well, ; if she's as good a fellow,
using the' term In its best sense, as he Is,
.why, heaven -has been bountiful to what
they call 'the' great and glorious West.' "
"Herewith I send you two letters and
cables for Miss Brunnen," he eaid, dic
tating to his clerk a note to Philip Grey,
"and a cable for yourself. Will you kind
ly, forward the former to your cousin.
Miss Zella Brunnen, and say how much
I desire to see her. If she does not feel
disposed to come up to town I will wait
upon her at Bournemouth or Eastbourne,
or anywhere else she may appoint. Ques
tions must presently arise of importance
in connection with her property in Platts
Valley and Prudents Gulch, and Miss
Brunnen's still more important Inherit
ance under the late Hiram Dexter's will
â questions which we (Miss Brunnen,
yourself and myself) should discuss to
gether. I am not now writing for the
firm, but simply between ourselves; and
I therefore add that. If Miss Brunnen
would caro to have some friends of mine
at Eastbourne call upon her, I shall be
delighted to try and make the city by the
sea more cheerful than it can be .with, a3
you tell me, only one visitor, and that a
medical man. Also, let' mo say how
pleased T shall be if you will dine with
me at -the. club to-night, to meet one or
two . fellows, whose acquaintance may be
agreeable to you." '
/"Transcribe that at once, and let me
have it."
"Yes, sir," said the clerk, and left the
room.
Mr.. Richard- Lorrlmer took his seat be
fore a heavy mall and flashed his eye
glass at It with a sprightliness quite in
keeping with the exhilarating morning. A
shorthand clerk sat opposite to him. Mr.
Lorrimer thrust a small silver. paperknlfe
Into the envelopes, and almost simultan
eously Bcemed to dictate his replies. As
he rattled on he laid aside several letters
and telegrams addressed to the care of
the firm. These were for Mis3 Zella Brun
nen. After dealing with the pile of cor
respondence he turned them over curious
ly and looked at their, postmarks. They
were all from Chicago, letters and cables.
One Â¦ of them was addressed "Philip
Grey." There was no reason why that
should strike him as odd, but it did.
They were all very early birds at Bed
ford row, lawyers and sparrows; and the
Eprlng adjacent trees came out as. green
and chirpy as if they were country born
and bred. 1 .
"ALL ABOARD!"
It was a busy night with Zella. Until
quite late she was at packing find unpack
ing, writing letters and looking at time
tables and tasking questions. She was
evidently bent upon flight.
Â¦ Zella, full of her schemes for the fu
ture, made her way into the Strand, and
thence to her hotel. She ordered her bill.
Then she went to her room. She began
to overhaul her trunks. She paid her bill
but she did not give up her rooms. She
would speak with the manager, she said.
Then she went out. and made many pur
chases. \ Hitherto she had not been able
to make up her mind what kind of pres
ents she would take home, for Bridget
and the ; Parkside people; for the Man
ageress Of the Athletic Club, for the two
professors, for Mr. Storey, for Joe Will
iams, for her partner Dankes, for Cap
tain Dan, for Dave, and for Mickey, who
had "Hoorroohed after poor *Ned and
wished him luck. â¢ â¢ â¢ She found -that
she would require a large sum of money
the next day from Lorrimer. The account
of Philip Grey was getting low at tho
National Provincial Bank. Drexel, Mor
gan & Co. had cashed Zella's latest draft
But Philip, it is hardly necessary to say,
could sign Zella's name for any amount.
Lorrlnier had intimated that, apart from
the deposit Philip Grey had made on her
behalf and the securities in his hands.
Miss Brunnen's name was goocP for .'any
amount that her cousin might Â¦' require.
Zella had kept up the reality of her own
position and personality by . correspon
dence .with' great care and skill. She
had | even gone down to Eastbourne once
to mail two letters thence | to Straker,
Love and Lorrimer: but. as Philip. .she
generally received Instructions by letter
direct, and as Philip she had sent Zella's
letters to her "dear cousin Phil" on to
Lorrlmer. One day Lorrimer asked her
what Miss __Brunnen would be likely to do
with the great wealth which been be
queathed her. As Philip she had replied
that really neither of them cared much
about money; it was quite possible that
Zella would hand the disposition of it over
to him (Philip), but of course he should
consult her in everything, and he should
not be at all surprised that she would de
vote a great deal of it to some' national
purpose. Taking this magnanimous view
of SJiss Brunnen's dealing with her great
fortune, Philip Grey had gone up tremen
dously Mn Lorrlmer's good opinion. In
deed, Lorrlmer had quite bored his Eisier
and one or two friends with his constant
references, to the young American; no
wonder America was the nation it was
when It could boast of such sons as Philip
Grey, who combined In his character all
the reverence that culture should have
for art and literature and antiquities of
the Old World with all that was : high
minded and progressive and young and
hopeful and ambitious in the New!'
"I should thinK so, you young. hass!"
he exclaimed, as he gathered himself and
his. load together.
tlons hot .. from the press; for Zella had
turned into one of the side streets
toward the Strand.
Zeila little knew what an Impression she
had made on Lorrimer. "What a hand
some youngster!" he had said to himself,
as he walked. from his office in the after
noon, for app of tf-a at his club and to
order dinner, and then to his chambers
in Whitehall Court. "If Miss Zella Briin
ncn is anything like Philip Grey she is all
poor Ned described her. And clever, too
by Jove! For a minute It seemed as If
I was cross-examining him in court; but
the rest of the time 1- felt as If he were
cross-examining me! Hang me,. If I ever
remember being so impressed with a
young fellow! -And he has Just a bit of
music in his American accent that one
notices In a cultivated Scotchman's soup

was fairly musical. Well-dressed, too!
They say America Isn't great in tailoring,
but Poole couldn't have made a better
frockcoat, nor old Sandeman better fitting
breeches. Well.' -wo .-shall see if he im
proves on acquaintance."
Zella, having no idea that she had
mad* a good impression on Ned's dearest
friend, did not look ; forward to meeting
him again with any , great expectations
of relief from the gloom that was settling
down upon her, notwithstanding thÂ«
glory of the London * streets ., and tho
pageantry of the park. Perhaps the very
brightness of the strange city.H blossom
ing into its annual season of fashion and
furbelows, of gayeties and social -.func
tions, of balls and parties, of plays and

But, oh, she was very lonely! The one
reed that she had looked to lean upon in
I/omlon broke at the first touch. If only
Ned's friend, Lorrimer, had said even a
few sympathetic nothings to her. It was
true he had unbent at last; it was true
she was going to dine with him; it was
true he had expressed an intention to be
kind to hor and show her some. hospital
ity; but, oh, she was pad and lonely! It
had even been a relief to sppak with the
coachman. She wondered if it had not
been better to have come as herself, Zellu
Brunnen. In that position she would as
suredly have 'commanded at least the
gentler attentions of Richard Lorrimer.
How disappointed bhe was in him! Not
in his appearance. He was not what
might be called handso'me; but he had
fine eyes, his manners were reflned, he
was evidently a gentleman.
DICK LORRIMER AND HIS GUEST.
CHAPTER XLIII.
"Her Majesty don't care for Buckln'em
Palace, but London loves her Just the
same."
Then Wellington on his horse and the
four typical warriors at the base of the
equestrian figure, recalling memories of
her father's oft-repeated saying, "Almost
the only people we ever fought were your
English mother's countrymen, and In
whom Prussia never had braver or truer
allies; a great people, the English." â¢ â¢ â¢
Oh, that he, or her mother or- Ned, or
some dear friend, were with her â even Mr.
Storey or Glencoe or Bridgetâ that she'
might have some one to "speak to, some
one with whom she might relieve, in
words, â¢ the . deep emotions of her heart.
Sho seemed so lonely amidst tho great
and brilliant crowd. She had never imag
ined anything so imposing as Hyde
Park, with Its procession of carriages,
three or four abreast, and Its splendid ar
ray of horses, its superb toilets, its
handsome women, its gallant men and Its
multitude of gayly attired people on the
Fidcwalks, the brilliant array of sun
shades and parasols, backed by orna
mental trees in the first freshness of
spring leaves, and here and there great
patches of crocuses ana tulips. A new
world to Zella. â¢ â¢ â¢ Presently, in obe
dience to an official hand, the autocrat of
the streets, there was a gradual suspen
sion of movement, a passage way was
made, a number of outriders cantered by;
then every hat was raised, and it seemed
to Zella as If every lady rose to her feet.
A carriage, drawn by four white horses
ridden by postillions, came along. An
elderly lady was bowing right and left,
with a young demoiselle hy her side and
on the opposite seat an officer In a bright
uniform. The elderly* lady was bowing
right and left, a pleasant smile lighting
up a benevolent face; It was her Majesty
the Queen of England, with the Princess
Beatrice and the Duke of Connaught.
Zella at once guessed it was the Queen,
and as her Majesty left the park she
heard the great burst of cheering that
greeted her at Hyde Park Corner and fol
lowed her on her way to Buckingham
palace, where, the coachman told her. the
Queen was to stay the night. "A great
event for London," he said.
In Pall Mall Zella met a squadron of
cavalry, marching to the strains of their
fine mounted band. Some special function
was being celebrated, she thought. Other
flags were flying from the club houses.
Her coachman had to pull up near St.
James Palace. More troops came swing
ing round into Pall Mall, from the Park.
The eight of the worn old historic pile,
the inspiring strains of the military band,
followed presently by the wild swirl of
the bagpipes and the tramp of a company
of Gordon Highlanders overcame her; she
had to mop her face with her handker
chief. â¢ â¢ â¢ Her carriage now threaded
its way along St. James street: and It
seemed to her that the entire region was
peopled with ghosts of past days, ghosts
of buildings, ghosts of great events, ghosts
of famous people, ghosts of her mother's
ancestors, the dead, patient little woman
she Just remembered, with her sweet
English voice; the ghosts of Glover's for
bears, and the realities, too, of the Lon
don he was to reveal to her. Then round
Into Piccadilly, with scores of equipages,
beautiful women In gorgeous attire, pow
dered footmen, smart victorias, family
chariots with armorially decorated pan
els, and on the pavement a well-dressed,
throng of pedestrians. On one hand tho
Green Park, on the other a row of pal
aces.
And she was there, punctually; and with
considerably revised opinions of both Lor
rlmer and London from those he and the
great city had at first inspired. During
the day she had found her way to West
minster and the Thames embankment, to
Oliver Goldsmith's grave In the Temple,
to St. Paul's completing her experiences
in an open barouche, provided by the ho
tel, along the Mall and Piccadilly to the
Park. April was verging Into May. It
was nearing the height of the London
season. The sun shone warm on the gray
streets. Every other shop seemed to be
a goldsmith's, or to flash with silver,
when It was not bright with flowers or
gay with costly fabrics and pictures.
Here and there tho Stars and Stripes
flaunted high up against the blue sky,
making her heart beat the quicker. Oh,
If Ned Glover could have been by her
Fide! Sometimes she thought he was.
Once she was sure she heard his voice. It
was like a joyous whisper of content that
she should at last have seen his beautiful
London, from which Fleet street had ban
ished him, but to which he had meant to
return a conqueror, hand In hand Â¦with the
loveliest woman in the world.
"I will be there," said Zella.
"Not at all; the kindness will be on your
side. The .Sheridan is close to Covent
Garden? But every cabman knows It.
Where nre you staying, may I ask?"
"At the Grand Hotel." said Zella.
"Only a walk to the Sheridan. Then,
I Ehall expect you?"
will dine with me to-niÂ«rht. Now. don't
Eay you are otherwise engaged. I have
so much to say to you and you must have
plenty to say to me. E.ght o'clock at the
Sheridan Club, eh?"
"Oh. thank you," said Zella, "yon are
very kind."
players, of picture exhibitions, of royal
levees, and the time for debutantes and
society, weddings and aristocratic high-
Jinks, had got upon her nerve3. She had
never before felt so solitary. The lake of
Chicago, miles and miles* away from
shore, the woods of Platts Valley, silent
as the grave, had never once seemed lone
ly; nor had the great prairie over which
she had. roamed, beyond Chicago's
furthest outposts; nor the vast wastes
she remembered, when a girl, on the
skirts of the frontier, made* a solitude to
her so profound as London, with all Its
hum of voices, the thunder of its streets
and the multitudes of its people.
"We don't treat strangers as hospitably
In our clubs. as you do in America," said
Lorrimer, when they had adjourned to
the 6moking-room of the Sheridan. "You
give us the run of your entire house; we
set apart , special rooms for you â 'strang
ers' rooms' Â¦ we call themâ and we treat
you as strangers. It Is a' survival of an
old custom of clubs, like a bit of the Brit
ish constitution; it seems ; to work fairly
well, Â¦ however. We are a ; conservative
people and an exclusive."
"I don't know much of club life," said
Zella; "your rooms seem, to me to be
very charming; I have never seen any
so crowded with pictures; and, I may
say, without, I hope, offense, ' that the
dinner was excellent, the fish remarkable,
the poufflet perfect. I am not sure that
It Is what you call the right thing for a
guest to comment on his entertainment."
"Oh! yes, quite the correct thing, I as
sure you," said Lorrlmer, Â¦with a laugh.
"And now what will you take with your
coffee? Benedictine, chartreuse,-kum
mel?"
"A little benedlctlne, thank you," said
Zella, taking out her cigarette case.
"Won't you smoke a. cigar?"
"No, thank you. I am not a great
smoker, and I generally carry my own
mild cigarettes."
"Well, as you please. May I Join "you?
A cigarette is a. good preliminary to a
cigar."
.Zella passed Â¦ her case, and Lorrimer
commended tli3 flavor of the tobacco*
"Few strangers dining to-night," he
said. " and they all appear to be going
to the operaâ a Pattl night. We might
have gone, but I thought we would have
a quiet chat. And we are in the way of
it; evidently got the emoking room to our
selves. I hope Miss Brunnen Is better?"
"Yes, thank you. She seems to feel
lonely; I suppose one does in a strange
city, where one has no friends."
"But she shall make friends. My sister
shall call upon her. My sister's a 'rare
gossip; knows everybody worth knowing;
a regular gadabout, but as good a crea
ture as ever lived. Single, like myself;
but the liveliest old / maid Imaginable.
Could have married a dozen times; Is only
forty now, and looks ' twenty. I am sure
Miss Brunnen will like her; and you, too.
Oh! we'lj soon surround both of you with
friends."
Zella was amazed at the change In Lor
rimerâ"Dick," as .one or two clubmen
called him, men who were entertaining
strangers.' He was full of high spirits;
natural, unstrained; and his laugh was
fairly catching. With Lorrlmer's exuber
ance Zella'? spirits rose, and she detected,
fcr the first time, something of the brogue
he' had himself spoken of In his speech,
lie was an Irishman, who knew nothing
of Ireland; had nfcver set foot In It since
he left It as a lad, and, was never sus
pectod of his nationality. He was not
ashamed of it; but be was at heart a Lon
doner, by Instinct and habits a very Cock
ney: knew I^ondon Inside out, and could
quote you almost avery poetic tribute the
Muses had ever paid to it.
"You are not a marrying family, then?"
said Zella; so like a. woman to take hold
of this casually dropped word about mar
riage.
"My youngest sister Is married, and I
have a brother living happily in that
pleasant state. As for myself, well, I
have never seen my fate. You haven't a
sister, eh?"
"No. Why?"
"Life is full of surprises. I shouldn't
have wondered that, if you had a sister,
she might have influenced my destiny,"
and he laughed heartily at the notion.
"That confirmed old bachelor, Richard
Lorrimcr," he said, "to Miss Emily or
Elmlra. or Jane, or whatever it might be.
Grey, at St. George's, Hanover Square;
no cards! Sounds interesting, eh?"
"Then I may conclude you do not dis
approve ( of Philip Grey? And I thought
you hated me this morning." --.Â¦ *r'
"Was I so horribly brutal? They tell
me I am low, In business; positively low,
don't you know!" And he fixed his eye
glass at Zella; not defiantly, but with a
kind of apologetic meekness.
"You have made up for It since, Mr.
Lorrlmer. And I am much indebted to
you; for I was very, lonely and depressed
when I came here to dinner."
"Were you, now? And it was my fault.
I must really try and # correct that Infernal
professional habit of mine."
Ho dropped his glass, almost indignant
ly, and turned to light a cigar.
"Oh! no; you are not to blame In tha
least. I felt lonely, that is all; 1 ] and â -"
"Oh! by-the way," he said t suddenly,
"that comes of separating one's self so
entirely from business when one leaves

Downing street, the official residence of
the great' Minister, was easy to find,
though 'It did 'not convey to Zella's mind

carried it off well enough. No one ever
for a moment suspected her.. If her mas

"More show than use. I guess," said
Williams. "Gives a feller time to think;

"Don't eeem to want his old pane of
glass to lead by," remarked* Storey, In a
whisper.
He stood poring over the paper, intense
ly engrossed, for nearly half an hour.
His face was a study. Both Williams and
Storey turned from the window to watch
It.
He directed Lorrlmer's attention to a
heavily headlined half-page of the paper,
and Lorrimer read^ "THE ROMANCE

"Mr. Storey Is not given to fits of this
kind, I assure you," said Williams, "and
my profession Is almost as serious as
your own; so you may conclude there Is
a Joke lying around somewhere," said
Williams.
"Forgive our seeming rudeness, Mr.
Lorrlmer. Don't get mad, sir." said Stor*
cy, sitting* down and fairly shaking with
laughter.
"Really, gentlemen," he said, "If there
is a Joke going I may be glad to partici

"Really! Is he, indeed?" said Storey,
unable to control his laughter. "Her

He turned his beaming face to the de

"I have seen letters from her; and her
cousin. Mr. Philip Grey, is In daily com

"Excuse me," said Storey, "If I seem to
be too curious, but how do you know she
is at Eastbourne?"
"And Mr. Storey never had a . more

would eay that I and my wife, Mrs.
Storey, have a deep and affectionate re

"Part of which I know, sir: and all of
which interests me," said Lorriraer.
"And where is Miss Brunnen, may I
ask?" said Storey.
"At Eastbourne, I believe," Lorrlmer re
plied.
"At Eastbourne, eh? And when, ilr,
dld'you see her last?"
"I have not seen her at alL"
"Not seen her!" exclaimed Storey and
Williams together.
They were a remarkable pair, as the
reader well knows. Storey and Williams:
Story, long, bony, angular, but with a
fine head and a strong, frank face; Wil
liams, dapper, smart, alert and "dressy"
â"decidedly dressy"â as Story had com
mented, when they met. accidentally at
the Langham, Storey just arrived from
Chicago and Williams from Vienna. Dur
ing hia absence he had been appointed to
Washington, and Storey had been,
furthermore, glad to learn that the case
wnich had called him away from America
had come to a satisfactory conclusion,
giving Williams both kudos and money.
They had very surprising stories to tell
each other, and they were now about to
very much astonish the popular Junior
partner of Straker, Love and Lorrimer.
"Often heard of you, from my dear
frienu, Glover," said Williams. "Seems
like a message' from the dead to present
his card to you and his few words of In
troduction." i \
"Indeed, it does." said Lorrlmer. "Ha
mentioned you to me In one of the very
few letters I received from him."
"He had no better friend that Mr.
Storey," said Williams.
Lorrimer put out his hand and wel
comed his visitors with unusual geniality,
though he staggered Storey for a moment
with a critical survey through his mon
ocle.
"I am Storey," said, the Chicago Jour
nalist, "and this Is my friend, Mr. Wil
liams, the head of the Secret Service De
partment of Washington, recently ap
pointed from Chicago." .
"Good morning, gentlemen." eald LorTl
mer, going forward to meet them, with
more of the manner of "Dick" than of
Richard Lorrimer. "1 am glad to aeo

to conceal his surprise.

with much ceremony, the American detec

He had left his chair, and walked about

envelope, which he directed and sealed.

to his clerk, "and wait for an answer."
As the clerk left the room the liveried
porter, who seemed to have caught the
lively spirit of the morning, entered with
an elastic step and head erect to an
nounce. 'Two gentlemen, without an ap
pointment, but must see you, they say; ail
the way from Chicago for that purpose-
Mr. Amos V. Storey and Mr. Joseph Will
iams, and Mr. Williams has an Introduc
tion to you from the late Mr. Edwin Glo
ver."
For the moment Lorrlmer was quite ob
livious of the presence of Storey and
Williams. They had been too much taken
aback by the appearance of Zella, and
the perfectly calm and gracious way in
which sho had received them â "like a
queen In her own right," aa Storey re
marked afterwardâ that they "gave thÂ«
London lawyer the floor." as Williams ob
served. And Ix>rrimer made the best of
his opportunity.
"Whatever your feelings may be. Miss
Zella, In regard to that rash, and per

"Bo merciful, as you are powerful â¢*
said Storey.
"And when do we return home?" asked
Zella.
"Whenever you please." Storey replied
"With you and Mr. Williams, as my Â«sl
cort?"
"Why. certainly." said .Williams.
"I have Important business In America *â¢
said Lorrimer. "Won't you permit me to
be one of the company?"
"Oh. yes. certainly; by all means." Zella
replied. "What do you say. Mr. Storey?"
"Whatever you say,' my child."
"Then all go away, and pack. I am dy

once more, and longing to begin the
transformation of Platts Valley and Blind
Man's Drift."
THE END."
As they entered a handsome and stately
lady came forward to receive them.
There was nothing of the Amazon In her
appearance. As In her beautiful face, so
In her dress, there was a note of serious
ness. Her (town -was of white crepÂ« da
chine; a trailing gown, that at the sama
time set rather clo3e to her graceful
figure. It was white, with a white fichu.
edged with black velvet ribbon. At her
walstbelt she wore a bouquet of violets,
and around her neck a black band with a
diamond pendant. Her wealth of hair was
tied up In a knot, hlsh upon her head.
The general effect of her appearance was
that of a young lady of distinction, whose
beauty needed jio artificial aids. Storey,
for a moment, hardly knew the hand-mmj
young woman of Parkslde, and Lorrlmer
and the other visitors were each equally
amazed.
Taking them all Into one welcoming.
but surprised survey, Zella exclaimed, her
face wreathed In smiles, "Why, Mr.
Storey! And Mr. Williams! Well, this la
delightful. I am real glad to see you!
She took both their hands ar.d shook;
them heartily.
They said nothing:: but looked around
at Lorrimer.
"Mr. Lorrlmer. I guess I don't know
whether to be glad to see you or not,"
she said. "I fear you will never forgive
me; Indeed. I can hardly forgive myself."
"Miss Zella Brunnen." said Lorrlmer.
"there's nothing In the wide world I could
r.ot forgive you! You well nigh made a
willing slave of me aa Philip Grey; but
as Zella Brunnen! Well, there. I don't
know what to say to you!"
"Only say you don't despise me, Jlr.
Lorrimer." said Zella, putting out her
hand, her lip trembling as she spoke.
"Despise you!" he exclaimed, pressing
his lips to her hand. "I admire you be
yond all womenâ X love you."
as good-looking as himself and as pleas
ant and companionable, the fact might
possibly have a 'serious Influence on my
destiny."
"My dear sir," said Storey. "thÂ« girl
.couldn't help bÂ«ing lovely, whatever char
acter she might assume. If MI33 Brunnen
is In Eastbourne, whera is Mr. Philip
Grey?"
"At tho Grand Hotel," said Lorrlmer.
"I have only just sent some letters and
cables, to himâ erâ I mean, to her. Mv
dear sirs, both of you. I beg you won't
talk about this; I mean, so far aa I am
concerned; I shall be the laughing-stock
of the town."
"That goes. Mr. Lorrimer. And I don't
know as It would be good for Zella *o
have It known In Chicago she carried h^r
masquerade further than her splendid act
of love and vengeance."
"I assure you. gentlemen, she â erâ ha
has been most circumspect, delicate and
discreet"
"Why, of coarse," said Storey. "Not a
better girl lives, not a more reflnedâ for
an Amazon; eh. JoeT*
"That's so; but, as you say, an Amazon
after all. And I speak from practical
knowledge."
"Come along. Mr. Lorrimer. What do
you Bay? Will you Join us? I propose to
ro â¢traiffhtway to the Grand Hotel."
"Do you think we ought to go without
letting Mr. Grey â erÂ»â I mean, the lady â
know of our Intention to call?"
â¢Why, certainly! Do you think we
should find her otherwise?"
"ICo, sir; no warning- "TC> are her
friends, and I have the dignity of belns
one of her trustees. Can't we call a cab?"'
A cab was called, and straightway, aa
Mr. Storey had proposed, they went to
the Grand.
"Mr. Philip Grey." *ald Lorrlmer at the
desk. "Is he in?"
"Mr. Philip. Grey left the hotel late last
night." said tho clerk.
"Left!" exclaimed Storey. "Where for?"
"Eastbourne. Beg pardon, but la one of
you gentlemen named Mr. Joseph Wil
liams?"
"Yes. Why?" William* replied.
"You telegraphed here from Paris?"
"Yes. sir: and Mr. Grey was at the desk
talking to the clerk when your measago
came, and he said he knew you and that
you would probably call upon him: and
that If you did so. whether he was In or
out, you should bÂ« shown to his slttlns
room."
"Then he has not given up his rooma?"
"No; hÂ» has been expecting his cousin
to occupy them. But please to bo up.
Boy!"
"Yes. sir."
"Show these gentlemen to Mr. Grey's
room." ". â¢;',
And away they went to the elevator.
less jubilant than before, but more pu*

"The blrd'a flown." tiald. Storey;- "all*
through you, you dude! Why couldn't
you have wired to every other hotel ex
cept the Grand?"
"I have stayed here several times.**
"Confound you!" saia Storey.
The boy knocked at the door.
"Come!" said a voice from within.
The boy opened the door and stood
aside. \ The three visitors, each pushing
with a certain timidity to give the other
first place, stepped In.

face. "You received my cousin's letter
from New York?"
"AccrcdltU.jr you. as her representative;

"Have you, may I ask, received any
telegrams from Chicago?"
This was a speculative shot of Zell&'s
en the strength of several cables that
wore docketed among Lorrimen's bundle
of papers.
"Vos," he said, turning 1 over the mes-
Hpes which Zella had noticed, and ex
amining them by the aid of his glass.
"One from Storey, Dally Mail, -one from
Bridget O'Hagan, one from Hlldyards.

any messages or letters to her to your

"In town, is she?"
"Ye?: In London."
"Came over with you?"
"She couldn't come â¢without me."
"Indeed'." said Lorrlmer, contemplating
Tier, glass In eye. with a puzzled expres
sion. "Then t=he was actually on board
the rmhria when Dexter, the millionaire,
committed suicide?"
"Here is the passenger list."
Lorrimcr took the paper from her and
examined it as if it might have been a
document in evidence that he would pres
ently hand up to the bench.
"Don't eea the name of Philip Grey," he
paid: which for a moment flurried Zella,
who began to think he suspected her.
"Here is a corrected list," she said,
handing him the second roll of passen
gers.
"Greyâ and no Brunnen. But why these
trilling details, Mr. Grey?" ' <:.
"Just what I was asking myself," Zella
rer>'ip<l.
"Keg pardon," said Lorrlmer, as If ad
dressing the other Fide. "I suppose I

"At present she is not quite well; rather
dif.-mpointcd with London, I think "
"Nias.ira has disappointed some travel

"So I am told," paid Zella. with a touch
of asperity in her manner. "My cousin
may po to Eastbourne or Bournemouth

charge will be good for her."
"She is well advised no doubt And
now, what can I do for you. Mr. Grey?
Or for MIps Brunnen between now and
the day when she honors me with a call?"
Zellr. felt It was time to establish tho
Vona-fldes of Philip Grey in such a way as
to entirely win the lawyer's confidence. .

breast pocket a bundle of papers, "has

"Miss Brunnen has the very highest

"We Fhall strive to Justify her good

pafe. leaving his table desk and passing
round to the side of the room where sh*
was Kitting. "And I think that brines
our bufiness interview to an end."
"I think so," said Zolla, a cold chill at
her heart as she rose to take her leave.
"Don't po for a minute, please." said
Lorrimor in another tonÂ« of voice and
with a genial manner that surprised her.
"In the first place let us shake hands " "
She put out her hand in a perfunctory
kind of manner. He pressed it cordially

MEN WITH GREEN. HAIR.
epÂ» rroRVlSG to Professor L. LÂ«?win
// \\ of Berlin, a distinguished German
i! f iÂ«?ntist, th*Â» hair of pome copper
workers is almost certain to tarn
preen pooner or later. The professor has
been studying the subject for the last few
years, and he tells the result of his inves
tigations in the current .number of tho
Deu!5rhe Medlr'-.liLil* WOCllCHBChnfL
"For renriy 250 years." he says, "pci
entlsts have known that the hair of per-
sons employed In coppÂ«r works Is apt to
become greenâ a eurlous fact and one
which Is especially Interesting from a bio
logical point of view. The general belief,
however, that the hair becomes green
after a few days' work in summer Ic er
roneous. Workmen perspire freely during
the summer, and the dust from the cop
per naturally clings to their skin and
tend* to give their hÂ«lr a greenish hue.
This j,;ccn, however, can be easily washed
off.
"The true green does not appear In the
hair of workmen until they have been
pome years at thÂ» business, and neither
by wrshing- nor by the. use of chemlculs
can they ever wholly rid themselves of it.
I have exe mined over 300 workmen, and
yet I find that only eight of them had any
trace of green in their hair. I examined
one men. a brass polisher, .who had been
twenty-seven years in the factory, and I
found his hair of .1 natural color. On the
other hand. I found another polisher who
had a green Lcard. ISvon animals' hair
becomes green under jÂ«uÂ«*h condlt'ons Th's
was clearly proved to me by the d-scolored
hair of a goat which used to frequent a
certain copper factory and which used to
drink daily without any evil reaulrs the
water in which the copper was washed.
"In the case of workmen the hair of the
head and beard changes color 'more often
than that of the eyebrows, and. as a rule,
the beard changes first. On men with
white or fair hair the change can be no
ticed more readily than on those, with
dark hair. Another peculiar fact Is' that
after some yenrB the green may disappear
from th* ba'.r, prftvlded the workman Is
no longer employed at fhis trade. I knew
one old man whd*e hair, which was very
gTeen while ho was working at copper,
became snow white soon after he ceased
to work. On the ether hand, a story Is
told of a workman whose hair, which waa
whit* while he was at work, became green
within five months after he had stopped
working. "~
"In the cases which 1 studied the green
was spread evenly over the whole halt,
which is curioua In view of the fact that
two other scientists who have been study
ing this subject discovered more green at
the roots of the hair than any where ~e'!Â»*.
The color Itself, I found, varied from. the
lightest grÂ«Â«u to tho very darkest green."
THE PRICE OP SPIDERS.
*jn? DEALER in natural history specl
/L\ mens who has a little shoo in the
Jl East End of London has discovered
that there is a market for spiders.
ThÂ» spiders are sold by the hundred, thy
prices ranging from 2z fid to 3s. and the
buyers are small firms of wine merchants.
These merchants stock, their cellars with
new. freshly labeled Â»vlne, sprinkle duÂ«>t

weave their webs from cork to cork.
The cobwebs natural'v lead the custom

The insects are collected from all parts,
and some of the large ones of the garden

weave a particularly strong, thick web.
When received these spiders are placeii

The cook had opened her mouth to say
that she thought her wage* ought to be
raised 52 pÂ»r month, when there was a
low rumbling, a trembling of the who's
ranjre, and next instant the covers flew
up to the ceiling, the doora banged open
and a burst of flame filled the kitchen.
Mrs. Bowser from the room above heard
a howl from the cat. a scream from tha
cook and a yell from Mr. Bowser, and she
knew what had happened. She couldn't
go down for the smoke, but as she opened
the front door the trio came flying out of
the basement to roll in the snow In tha
front yard.
It wasn't much of a fire. ThÂ© seven or

set everything and flooded water all over
the floors soon had it out. and in the
course of a quarter of an hour the open
doors and windows had freed the hou3Â«

with red eyes ar.d slnsed hair, and Mrs.
Bowser finally faced him and asked:
"Well. sir. any further experiments this

"Wo-wo- woman!" he gasped as he lifted

IMPORTANT CHANGES

forbade those around her to eay that she
was ill. The Queen Victorian tradition
and etiquette decreed that she is never ill
and so with dogged determination she
fought off the ravages that worry over
the Boer war, the deaths in her own fam
ily and her Increasing years have brought
upon her. But against the ruthless hand
of nature even the Imperial resolve of the
ruler of the great empire . proved f uttla
and with a pitiful realization of the inev
itable she shut herself off from her en
tourage. For two nights she dined alona
and never stirred from the apartments
she occupied at Osborne.
Humblyâ for this woman ruled her court
with no uncertain handâ her court officials
implored her to seek medical advice.
These messages she steadfastly Ignored,
and though to-night her condition is ad
mitted to be most serious there are in at
tendance only E>rs. . Powell and Reid.
Doubtless the Princo of Wales will to
morrow secure additional medical talent.
Her Majesty I lies helpless and almost
speechless in her bed in Osborne House,
surrounded by every comfort Fruit,
flowers, ice and all the accessories of
modern medicine are at hand. Osborne
House is buried amid a , gloomy park of
flr%; The wind comes up from the chan
nel and surges through the trees like ' a
Engllsh without the august presence o*
one who has endeared herself to her peo
ple'in a peculiar manner and to a degree
unattainable by the sovereign of any
other land."
The Sunday Special says: "Under the
circumstances the nation may mourn for
the sovereign they have lost; but surely
the sovereign is as happy in her death as"
In life, nor has there ever been a ruler
more worthy of the epitaph Sir Henry
Lawrence wished to be his. the nobest a
man or woman can desire, 'She tried to do
her duty.' "
Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper says: "His
tory will proclaim, in the words of the
poet, 'She wrought her people lasting,
good.' There can be.no gainsaying the
fact that the people in return love the
Queen as no sovereign was ever loved be
fore." ,
.. The Observer says: "ThÂ« temoprary
deprivation of her Majesty's guidance and
counsel in the present circumstances must
be a serious blow to the Govercjient. It
is well known that she has personally ex
ercised a profound Influence on the policy
of the country, both internal and external.
If her health should, unhappily, necessi
tate a temporary reltnquishment of the
cares and exhausting routine of the state,
we may console ourselves that she has
marked out the path of duty which her
representative will only- have to follow to
achieve assured specess."
_ ONDON. Jan. 20,-9 a. m.â The
H official bulletins . regarding the
I , Queen, posted at the Mansion
I House and Marlborough House
Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦^ on Saturdny, were read with ev-
ident. anxiety and discussed by
the large crowds constantly surrounding
them until a late hour of the night. At
the clubs the last\bulletln, saying there
was â a "slight' improvement," , was re
ceived with" some incredulity, as more
than one private telegram: was shown ex
pressing Â»the-, most unfavorable view - of
the progress of her Majesty's illness^
-. Among; the 'Â¦ominous . news of ,, the .pre
vious evening was the statement that the
Rev. Thomas < Davidson , %; D.;D., Bishop of
Winchester, 1 had been summoned and â¢ had
reached Osborne late last night.
':, Some'of the newspapers issued editions
as Â¦ late as 11 o'clock; 'and these i were ; eag
erly bought. They contained nothing, how
ever, to satisfy] the' pained '-. interest. The
Duke, of /, York'., was" .at ' York; House
late 'In' the evening, when it was an
nounced that-*he was not going to Osborne
until, to-day.'
Â¦ Besides : giving columns filled with the
latest" scraps ' of. * information., concerning
her^ Majesty's â¢ condition^: the ; movements
of members Â¦ of^ the royal i family, and per
sons connected "3 with ; the > court,' all ' this
xnornlnsr's' newspapers reflect -the fears of
the nation of a fatal termination of the
illness which has so unexpectedly stricken
down the aged monarch. They dwell at
length upon the deep love and. reverence
which the people cherish for the sovereign
who so long has guided the ship of state.
, The Sunday Times says: "The news
from Osborne House in the last few hours
has sent a thrill of anxiety not only
throughout these realms but wherever
the electric wires have flashed the intelli
gence. . There will be keen .suspense and
anxiety among her subjects until it i3

of her. ; "Whatever ,may be the feeling on

The Sunday Sun says: "There never was

were essentially democratic. For a little

and that was nil. All hope from that quar

was no longer the storm center of Europe.
The republic was only a republic in name.
It r was controlled, by men who detested
every Idea that had made republicanism
the ideal of our youth.. The glamour wa$
gone. Judged by the supreme test of
wager of nnttle. the ideas of our modern
democrats had been found woefully want
ing. The institution of/kingship was vin
dicated in full day not as a belated suv
vivalor an antiquarian curiosity but as a
supremely capable-institution as helpful
to the modern man as to his progenitor
in the days of Charlemagne.
The Prince did not die, but .we all wrote
obituary notices at great length, and had
leading articles in type headed "Death of
the Prince of Wales." Then night after
night we went down and waited till the
last bulletin came to hand before writing:
another leader. And I verily believe that
the suspense, prolonged for nearly a whole
week, with the Intense realizing sense of
all that was involved in the struggle for
life' that- went on in the sickbed at Sand
ringham, finally extinguished the last
smoldering embers of republicanism In
England. The typhoid fever did more for
the monarchy than the monarchy had
done for itself, and when the solemn
thanksgiving wm held in St. Paul's for
the Prince's recovery, tha cation gave
thanks not merely for the Prince restored
to health but for the deliverance, of tha
British monarchy from the danger which
had apparently menaced its security.
It was shortly after the recovery of the
Prince of Wales, that. I -.first saw the.
Queen. The moment was one when I was
suffering the full force of the cruel disil
lusion that overwhelmed all ardent Radi
cals after the general election of 1S74. It
is difficult to-day to recall the implicit
faith with which, after the establishment
of household suffrage and tha election of
the Radical Parliament of 1369. it waa*fle
lievt-d that the nation had entered upon an
Then it was that the opportune illness
of the Prince of Wales gave the final blow
to the house of cards which the republi
cans had been so assiduously building. It
sounds very brutal to say it, but there
were many who, when, the disease first
seemed likely to be Â» fatal, were by no
means disposed to regret a demise which
would deliver the. nation from a ruler
whom they believed unworthy to be the
sovereign of a Christian land. I wellire
member in those days a stalwart Radical
coming into the editorial sanctum of the
Northern Echo and saying. "What are
you going to say in your obituary leader?"
I said I had not made up my mind. Tho
Â¦Prince^was not dead yet. "Well." said
my visitor, "take my advice and just print
a column blank or with asterisks. Then
in the center print this, 'De mortuls nil
nl?l bonunu' " So saying my Radical
friend went his way.
Just about this' time the finishing stroke
was given to the last lingering remnant
of the old guard of republicans. In the
interviews and articles which In thosa
days used to appear In the press dlscuss-
Jng the probable date for the' overthrow
of the monarchy It was openly eaid that
while the Queen lived nothing would be
done. "But mark my words, sir," the re
publican apostles, would declare, "that
young- man will never ascend the throne.
It will never be permitted." The reports
about the Prince were relied upon as the
trump cards of the party of the revolu
tion. "We will not have this man to
reign over us," was an expression heard
in many places usually free from the con
tagion of republican bias.
The intrinsic absurdities of the Dllke
campaign contributed to swell the force
of the opposing current. It became evi
dent that the events of the previous year
had taught their lesson. There waa no
republican ralb 1 * in the provinces. The

there ran through the school when.it wag
announced that the marriage of the
Prince of Wales to the Princess Alexan
dra was to be kept as a public holiday, In
which the school was to share. A whole
holiday at Silcoates in mid-term was a
rare, almost unprecedented event, a boon
from the gods not to be credited easily or
spoken of lightly. Not only were there to
be no lessons all day, not even prepara
tion at night, but the boys were to go to
town to see the procession, to admire the
decorations, and possiblyâ although this
was hardly to be hoped forâ to see the il
luminations. I think we mads more fuss
in anticipation over the 'Prince's wedding
than ten years after I made about my
own. The Sea King's daughter from over
the sea was the universal heroine. Her
beauty, her simplicity, her goodness all
helped to idealize her to an extent some

Not even the marvelous spectacle of the

all her children knelt â in thanksgiving'

The next day in my calenda'r was the
first wedding in the royal family. I was
then a boy of ten or eleven. We kept up
a kind of make-believe that we did not
care about such trivialities, but as a mat
ter of fact we carefully cherished a col
ored print of the Princess Royal, and
worked ourselves up into quite a state of
excitement over her future. We did not
like the look of the Prince of Prussia as
he appeared in the prints. He did not
seem good enough for her. And my
father, who was ever much exercised in.
his dear old heart about German neology,
shook his head gravely over the marriage.
Mother did not like it either, and I think
we should have all been devoutly glad if It

It is necessary To make this explanation
to render conceivable the curious, little
feeling of resentment which is the very

ONE cf the most graphic re
views of thÂ© principal inci
dent* in the reign of Queen
Victoria appeared In the
March <1WT> number of the
Review of Reviews. It waa
by William T. Stead, a
well-known English jour
nalist. After a general Introduction he
proceeded as follows:
How and when and where it was that I
first conceived any deflnite idea of the
Queen as a visualized entity actually ex
isting in material shape on the surface of
this' planet I do not remember. But I can
remember very well the first picture . of
tho Queen that ever attracted my atten
tion. It is the portrait by which she is
best known to millions, the only picture
of their sovereign indeed which many of
them have ever -seen. It is the Queen's
head on the penny postage stamp. The
old unperforated red 6tamp was com
monly called In our home a Queen's
Head. I remfmber being told when I
:-.sked if the Queen was like that that she
was not so good looking. For there was
to idealizing of royalty in our home. Chil
dren nowadays, thank? to photography
and illustrated journalism, are familiar
â¢with the features cf the Queen. Hut in
those days it was otherwise.
In St. Petersburg in every Government
office and police station you are confront
ed with the painted or printed picture of
the Czar, who pilently looks down upon
you from the wall as if \o emphasize the
fact that everything Is done by his auto
cratic authority. The Queen's portrait
confronted us nowhere. Only on the nost
sje stamp did we pee the semblance of
Â¦the Queen's head. And how many mil
lions I wonder to this very hour, all our
modern appliances notwithstanding, have
never seen any ether portrait of her Ma
jesty but that on a-postage stamp? An
other image, however, must not be omit
ted. The conception produced by the
jvptag-e stamp was modified by the effigy
â¢rn the penny. They were gr^at big cart
wheels of copper in those days, bearing
in high relief the uncrowned head of her
Majesty. The difference between the two
Â¦omewbat puzzled the youthful mind,
which was thus early introduced to dif
fering authorities.
Thus equipped, with due foundation of
nursery rhyme and Bible stories and
lamiliarized by postage stamp and penny
jjiece with the Queen's image. I embarked
upon the next stape in the voyage of lite
âthat critical section wherein the vast
I'nknown world of the printed page optns
its marvels to the eye, and the child
learns to read. Reading soon became a
delight, and in reading history my ideas
of queens began to expand.

change that has taken place in the last

masses toward the crown.
It may at least be said for monarchy,
as it has been said for the stageâ it has
given woman an opportunity and a ca

government as yet devised by man. save

But elsewhere! To this hour I cannot
recall without pain the memory of that
overwhelming disappointment. The re
turn of Mr. Disraeli to power at the head
of a Conservative majority shattered
everything at one fell blow. It seemed as
if the underpinning of the world had given
way as if the sun had reversed its course
through the sky. Where then was cur
falth in the people? What had become of
our fond confidence In the democracy.
What could be thought of the sovereign
electorate which had elected such a man
as Disraeli to rule over them? Sick an.l
sad at heart I was pondering these ques

Atlantic the monstrous peculation of
Tammany obscured the fair ideal of th*
men of the Mayflower. At home, what
could be thought of a democracy that
made tha Barabbas choice of Disraeli?
But I was very far from caring much for
tha monarchy, and any nascent uncon
scious faith I might have had in its pos
sibilities of usefulness was rudely tried by
the policy of Disraeli. The alteration of
the royal title began It. and the sickening
orgie of Jingoism ended it. The detesta
' tion which Lord Beaconsfleld inspired in
tha Gladstonians In those days was like
nothing else In our time. The early Rad
icals hated Castlereagh as much; they
could not hate him more. To our thinking
Disraeli had tarnished tha crown, dis
graced the country, betrayed the cause of
humanity in the East, embarked on wan
ton wars. and. to crown all. had made tha
very name of imperialism to stink in tho
nostrils of all sane and sober Englishmen.
And through that discreditable chapter of
British history the Quaen was paraded as
tho special friend of tha evil Minister.
Whence sprang "Verax" pamphlets and
newspaper articles innumerable, to which,
mayhap. I In my small way contributed
my full share.
But the blight passed. Lord Beacons
field fell to rise no more, and the evil
taint of hia administration lingered but
for a short space around the throne.
Within a few months of the formation of
the Gladstona administration I was lr.
London, and what followed, can ba told /
in a few sentences. The nearer I came
to the center and heart of the. adminis
tration, the more closely I was able to sea
tha actual workings of the executive gov
ernment, the more I learned to appreciate
the inestimable advantage of having in the
very Innermost sanctuary of tha empire
a human being, head of a family which
will not pass with an adverse election,
with whom in all the graver affairs of
state Ministers must take counsel befora
they act. I realized more clearly than
ever before how the security, the con
tinuity and thÂ© prosperity of Britain de
pended much less upon tha politicians and
much more upon tha permanent^ the per
manent family above and the permanent
services below. When I went abroad and"
especially when 1 visited the great repub
lic of my earlier ideals I realized as I had
never done before the^enormous advantage .
of having the national unity and our im
perial greatness embodied in a person who
is carefully trained for that position from

WASHINGTON. Jan. 19.â The naval ap
propriation bill was reported to the House
to-day with an elaborate statement of its
plans by Chairman Fosa of the Naval
Committee. The bill carries $77,016,635, the
largest amount ever reported to the House
from the Committee on Naval Affaire.
This Is $11,865,718 above the bill of last
year and $10,229,395 below the estimates
submitted by the Navy Department.
Concerning the new ships for the navy
the report saj-s:
"For the purpose of further Increasing
the naval strength of the United States
the committee recommends that the
President be authorized to have built by
contract two unsheathed sea-gclng bat
tleships, carrying the heaviest armor
and the most powerful ordnance for ves
sels of their class, upon a trial displace
ment of about 14,000 tons each, to havo
the highest practicable speed and great
est radius V of action, and to cost, ex
clusive of armor and armament, not ex
ceeding $3,850,000 each, and two unsheathed
armor cruisers, carrying tho heaviest
armor' and most powerful ordnance for
vessels of their class, upon a, trial dis
placement of about 14,000 tons each, and
to have the highest practicable speed
and greatest radius of action, and to cost,
exclusive of armor and armament, not
I excec-Ging $4,0W,<A p y. Tne maximum cost of
1 the vessels herein authorized, exclusive
of armor and armament, will be $15,700,-
The bill provides that not more than
one battlesnlp or armored cruiser shall
bo built in one yard or. by one party, and
the usual provision is made that at least
one and not more than two, of the bat
tleships and armored cruisers shall bÂ«
built on the Pacific Coast.
Of the appropriations for the various
branches of the service the principal
item is $25,400,000 for the increase of the
navy. The pay of the navy is increased
;2.4W,3S7 over the appropriations for the
same objoct last year, and ia accounted
for bv the authority granted to. the de
partment to eniist 5000 additional 3eamen
and llfty warrant machinists to meet tho
necessity of properly manning- the new
ehlps soon to be added to the navy.
; To meet the emergency of the' lack of
officers for the new ships the bill provides
that the two cadet ' classes now at sea,
which have completed their four \ years'
course at ; the naval academy, shall be
commissioned. This will provide for. the

The committee recommends this year an

of the naval academy. In List year's bill
$350,000 was appropriated, prior to that
time $1,220,000. making a total appropria
tion of $1,570,000 prior to the present bill.
The report says In part as to the armor:
"Your committee also provides, under
the Increase of the navy, an appropriation
of $4,000,000 for armor and armament for
ships now under construction. It will be>
remembered that Congress wisely solved
the perplexing question of providing ar
mor'plate for our ships last year by the
enactment of a provision giving the Sec
retary of the Navy full power to buy ar
mor at such price as in his Judgment
might seem reasonable and Just, or to
build an armor .plate factory, toward
which $4,000,000 was appropriated. It
ought to be a matter of guneral congratu
lation that the armor plate question has
been settled through the skill, firmness
and excellent Judgment of the Secretary
of the Navy In carrying out the evident
purposes of Coneresa."
The citizens became enraged at the lo
cation of the building- within the city lim
its, and Friday night an attempt was
made to burn tho structure, but It was
saved by the prompt action of tho flra
department. To-night a crowd of men
gathered near the building, overpowered

building burn to the ground and then cit*

duly delivered up, England's demands
were complied with and there was no war.
This Incident, record of which was per
mitted In Sir Theodore Martin's "Life of
the Prince Consort," Is but one, although
the most important, of many such time
ly Interventions. Such a record, com
pared with the multitude of the unrecord
ed Instances of beneficent royal interven
tion, Is but as the summit of the Iceberg
which shows above the water compared
with the Immense mass that floats below.
Of this the nation is somewhat d'-Â»ily con
scious, ar.d our people at home and over
the sea go about their daily labor In the
comfortable assurance that In addition to
all the visible and tangible apparatus on
Â¦which they can count for the purpose
of preserving the peace of the realm and
the defense of its rights and interests,
they can also confidently rely upon the
unceasing vigilance and incomparable ex
perience of an Invisible . helper, who,
though her action Is unseen, hovers like
a guardian anRel over the peace of the
nations that call her Queen.
Among these consequences there would
probably have to be reckoned the estab
lishment of the Confederate republic
with slavery as Its chief cornerstone and
the introduction of the standing army
system of Europe into the American hem
isphere. There would also have been a
bitter and deadly blood feud between
England and tho Northern States. From
all these evils the world was saved by
the direct personal intervention of her
Majesty. The hectoring dispatch which
Lord Palmerston had prepared to forward
to the American Government would, in
the then strained condition of interna
tional relations, have been resented as an
Intolerable affront. War would have fol
lowed directly or in a very short interval.
Fortunately for the race and for the mon
archy, the granddaughter of George III
was able and ready to arrest the threat
ened mischief. Instead of approving the
dispatch it was returned to the bellicose
Palmcrston with the advice of her Maj
esty that it should be modified. The royal
counselor was in a position from which
she could speak with more influence than
any other person resident In the realm.
Lord Palmerston took back his dispatch,
struck out the passages Â¦which would have
provoked war and forwarded the emascu
lated version to Washington. The result,
as we all know, was a brilliant Justifica
tion of the wisdom of her Majesty's 'di
plomacy. The Confederate delegates were
lions of other common folk, to believe in
the monarchy, without saying at least a
passing word about the one well-known
occasion on which the Queen intervened
to save the English-speaking race from
the. Infinite disaster of a fratricidal war.
But for her prompt and decisive action
due, no doubt, primarily to the Initiative
of the Prince Consortâ the seizure of the
Confederate envoys from the British ship

Secession, would have Involved us In war

ultimate consequences of which we can

Graphic Story of an Eye- Witness to Rapidly Succeeding
Affairs of Momentous Interest to the World.
Nor can it be said that the Influence of
the Queen has only been Indirect or that
Fhe" has not again and again Interfered to
divert state policy from perilous paths
end to secure her empire's peace. Of that
I shall have more to say in subsequent
articles. But I cannot conclude this rapid
and fragmentary survey of the reasons
â¢which have led me. in common with mil-
Victoria Intervenes.
In many other ways the monarchy, es
pecially in the reign of the present sov
erciern. has contributed to the stability of
the realm and to the peace and content
ment of the people. Pre-eminent above
all other qualities which her Majesty has
displayed Is the supreme divine grace
of sympathy. The Queen. having
Buffered much, has sympathized the
more. Every gToat national disas
ter has evoked her warm-hearted
cuecor. If her Prime Minister has
been the head, her Majesty has ever
been the heart of the realm. It Â¦was some
what touching!}' remarked tho other day
that from her earliest childhood the
Queen had hardly ever been out of mourn
lr.g. Her life Indeed has been passed in
the shadow of the tomb, which has
opened to receive in slow succession al
most all her contemporaries and not a
few of her own children and children's
children. But still from the unfailing
depths of her womanly sympathy she
draws consolation for the bereaved and
rorr.fcrt for the Forrowine. Thus the
prcu<3f>?t empire the world has over seen
fhas Installed as Its sovereign the incar
rate genius of womanly compass-ion.
BB7 right even to stand 1 as candidate for
supreme office. And from my point of
view th!a alone, other things being equal,
â¢would turn the balance in favor of the
Crown.
But other things are not equal. The
balance of advantage in such an empire
as ours in favor of the monarchy is un
mlstakable. Every year the proportion of
English speaking folk outside these lsl
an<5s Increases. And with every such In
crease the political or Imperial value of
the royal family rises. For the tie which
unites our world-scattered common
â¢weaJihs is not primarily political, neither
Is It krpt up by politics. It is a tlÂ« in
Its nature domestic. It Is the English
epeak'.r.g family rather than an empire.
And the nexus !s the royal family rather
than the House of Commons. Every col
cry has Its ctvn legislative assembly.
None of th<?m has a queen and royal fam
ily. The Crown. likÂ»Â» Westminster Abbey,
Is one of th<Â» heirlooms of the whole race,
r.-hlch canr.ot be distributed. It must be
localized, and the mother country keeps
bcth. But If either the Crown or the Ab
bey diiappfared the sense of loss would
be felt as keenly In Winnipeg. In New
ZeaJar.d. !n Cape Colony and in Queens
land. To the eyes of the English speak
ing men who have made their homes at
the antipodes English politicians have not
the ln-.portance that they^ have at home.
Colonists have their own 'politicians, ar.d
es far away as England Is. the differences
between our politicians, even when seen
through the opera glass of the press tele
prams, are apt to eecra too infinitesimal
to be noticed. They xr.'.ght as well get up
sweepstakes about a race of mites acro?s
a. cheese. But high above all political
people there rises ever before the eyes of
every English-speaking man, whether re
publican or colonial or native to these
islands, the majestic fabric of the heredi
tary monarchy. It rises above the vast
democratic eteppe as the round tower of
Windsor ehows high over the Berkshire
plain. Its promlnente Is an element In Its
favor that is too often forgotten. Men
xr.ay come and men may go, Cabinets
emerge like fcamtells in the wave and
disappear, but the Queen is always there.
And when we have to do with many mil
lions, 5cattered over many continents, it
1b impossible to make any Impression on
the general mir.d by the fleeting phantoms
of evanescent ministries. To borrow an
illustration from photography, their ex
posure 1e not long enough. The plate is
r.ot Â£Â«:s;tlve enough for rapid photogra
phy. But the immobility, the massive
grandeur and the fierce light that beats
t round the throne, all facilitate the pro
duction cf a clear, xvpll-deiined image on
the mind cf our kin beyond the sea. Fa
miliarity is cf the essence of home. And
our progeny would feel themselves strang
ers in a. stranpe land if they were to re
turn to the old country, which they call
their motherland, only to f.nd. in place of
the Queen upon the throne. Mr. Chamber

Dr. Julius Remusson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run down
in health and of low vitality should eat
plenty of meat. If the direstlon is too
feeble at first It may be easily strength-
ened by the regular use of Stuart's Dys- !
pepsla Tablets after each meal. Two of
these excellent tablets taken after dinner
Â¦will digest several thousand grains of
meat, eggs or other animal food in thrc\j
or four hours, while the molt diastase
also contained in Stuart's Tablets causes
the perfect digestion of starchy foods, like
potatoes, bread, etc., and no matter how
weak the stomach may be, no trouble will
be experienced if a vtgular: practice is
made of using Stuart's Dye eps^a Tablets
because, thpy supply the pepsin and dias-
tase eo necessary to perfect digestion, an.l
any form of indigestion and stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach will
be overcome by thalr dally use. Â¦
That large class of people who come un-
der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
cat plenty of meat and insure its com-
plete digestion by the systematic use of
a safe, harmless dlgi stive medicine like
Htuart's Dyspepsia Â¦ Tablets, composed of
the natural digestive principles, neptcnes
and diastase, which actually perform the
work of digestion and give the abused
stomach a -chance to rest "and to furnish
the body - and ; brain with the necessary
nutriment. ; Cheap cathartic medicines
masquerading under tne name of dyspep-
sia cures are useless for relief or cure of
indigestion because they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of food
Dyspepsia in all its forms is simply a
failure of the stomach to digest food ami
the sensible way to solve the riddle and
cure the indigestion "!s:to make dally use
at meal time' of a safe preparation which
is endorsed by the medical prc.'ession and"
known to contain active digestive prin-
ciples, and all this can truly, be said 'of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
All druggists throuRtaout the United
States, Canada and. Great Britain sell
them at the uniform price of fifty cenls
for full treatment. .
â¢ As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat - furnishes the most nutriment in a
highly concentrated form and is digested
and assimilated ; more quickly than vege-
tables or trralns.
A healthy appetite and common sense
aro excellent guides to follow in matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and- meats 13 undoubtedly the best, In
spite of the claims made by vegetarians
and food cranks generally.

FOE REGULATION OF
GAS- AND WATER RATES
Competition Against New
Companies.
James' Bill "Will Prevent Cutthroat
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MEIs'TO, Jan. 19.â Assemblyman Frank
James of Los Angeles has introduced As
sembly bill 353. which is designed to pre
vent discrimination among the consumers
of gas, water or electric light. The meas
ure is in the nature of a grant of addl.
tional authority to the City Council or
governing body of a city extending Its
power from the simple fixing of the maxi
mum rate to the prevention of lowering
that rate in favor of certain consumers
unless the reduction is made general.
The bill stipulates that uniform rates
must prevail where the cost of the ser
vice in furnishing water, gas or electric
light ls the same. A reasonable differ
ence in the rate is permissible where in
accessibility or other conditions increase
the cost of service.
The granting of rebates is forbidden
and the author of the bill hopes to perfect
it to the degree that discrimination by
such methods can be prevented. He will
probably add two Important sections to
the measure before ft comes from the
Committee on Municipal Corporations.
One will make the power on regulation
extend to the furnishing 01 electric pow
er. The other will provide, within rea
sonable limits, that a rate once estab
lished must be maintained by a water,
gas or electric company, the object being
to prevent recourse to destructive compe
tition against a new company bv a well
established one that seeks to drive Its
rival out of business.
SAN QUENTIN APPATRS
MAY BE HTvTESTIQATED
Senator Belshaw Will Suggest a Visit
by the Committee on
Prisons.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â Before the end of next
week some steps toward legislative In
vestigation of conditions existing at San
Quentln, as disclosed ln the disappearance
of Walden, the Jute mill clerk, will be
taken.' Senator Belshaw, chairman of the
committee on prisons,' will suggest a trip
of the committee to the prison to look
into Its affairs, and after this inspection
action on an Investigation probably will
be taken.
"I cannot say what I shall do ln the
matter," said Senator Belshaw, "but in
any case I shall wait until after the com
mittee has visited the prison."
Since the decision of United States Cir
cuit Judge Morrow that the bonds of the
Modesto Irrigation District were legal the
feeling is that the irrigation system should
be completed as soon as possible. The sys
tem is partially completed. Eight hun
dred thousand dollars has been expended,
and It is estimated that $300,000 will com
plete the entire system and irrigate 80 000
acres of land.
MODESTO, Jan. 19.â Mandamus pro
ceedings were brought in the Superior
Court to-day to compel the directors of
the Modesto Irrigation District to call an
election for officers of the district. The
statutes set February 6 as the day for the
election, but the directors failed to order
one, acting under the recent ruling of Su
perior Judge Prewett of Placer County,
who enjoined them from performing the
duties of their office. Superior Judge Lor
igan of Santa Clara County presided to
day and decided that a writ of mandate
should be Issued compelling tho directors
to call such election. The board of direc
tors at present consists of four members,
only one of whom favored calling the elec
tion.
FIsk has another, doing away with the
compulsory year of single blessedness
after divorce. This may bring lobbies
from San Francisco and Reno with dif
ferent objects ln view. Carter has a bill
extending the statute of limitations on
unwritten contracts from two to four
years and on -written contracts from four
to eight years, and Bliss has a measure
which makes every male inhabitant, ex
cept Indians, Mongolians and the phys
ically and mentally Incapacitated, Instead
of every citizen, with the same excep
tions, liable for military duty In defense
of the State.

fons selling anything to them and raising
the crime of violating this law from a
ml6demeanor to a felony.
January to the first Monday in April, and
(by Devlin) to the second Monday in
March. The proposed change is received
with much favor among the legislators
and the people of the capital, and there
Is reason to believe that it will at least
be submitted to the voters. The prev
alence of sickness, colds, grip and violent
and incipient pneumonia among the leg
islators Is the principal reason for sug
gesting the change.
. Senator Devlin points out many advant
ages of the proposed change. He said to
day: "The first of the year is devoted to
settling up affairs and neither legislators
nor those interested in legislation can
conveniently Rive up as much time as a
legislative session demands. Then, again,
there should be ample time between the
election of new members of the Legis
lature and the convening of that body for
the lawmakers to study the public needs
and to familiarize themselves with the
merits and defects of proposed legislation.
The Governor and other ' State officers
take office on January 1. A lapse of two
months would enable a new Governor to
investigate the needs of State institutions
and bo to be in a position to advise the
Legislature of desired legislation.
"The comfort and health of members
of the Legislature are an important con
sideration. This Is the worst season of
the year in Sacramento, and for almost
the entire session members are compelled
to expose themselves day and night, for
regular meetings and committee meet
ings, to the rain, cold -winds and fogs.
They go from heated committee rooms
late at night into cold air saturated with
these penetrating land fogs, and colds and
more serious aliments are prevalent.
Many cases of illness and occasional
deaths result and these would be almost
entirely avoided if the session began two
months later.
"If the session were to begin about the
second Monday in March the season of
heavy rains and disagreeable fogs would
be past and yet the sixty days of the ses-
Blon would be ended before the heat of
the summer becomes oppressive."
Members of both houses, attaches of the
two branches and citizens from all parts
of the State who have suffered from the
fogs and raw weather of this season of
the year in Sacramento greet the pro
posed change with decided favor. Sen
ator Devlin and Assemblyman Knowland
believe thoroughly In Its desirability and
â¢will strongly .urge the acceptance of the
amendment. ' . -;.;.,Â¦

Melick's Bill Would Put an End to

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â By a bill Introduced in
the Assembly by Mclick an attempt is
made to suppress truancy on thÂ« part of
Bchool pupils and to provide some means
by which truants mav be kept under the
eye of the Bchool authorities when to give
them full liberty wouid but multiply op
portunities for them to repeat their of

Melick's bill provides an "attendance of- j
fleer" In each county whose business it
will be to investigate all cases of truancy,
to arrest the offender and have him sent
to a "parental school." where he will l>e
kept until the end of the school year.
An "habitual truant" Is defined as a
pupil who has played truant more than
twice In a year, or who, after having been
arrested once, is absent two days or tardy
on three days during the remainder of the
year without a lawful excuse. . A lawful i
excuse includes sickness or physical in- !
capacity, distance to the school. . which";
must be over two miles, and a necessity
for the labor of the. child for the-support
of the family. A habitual truant Is liablv

ENJODTS ERECTION OP
OIL DERRICKS ON BEACH
Itecision Rendered by Judge Bay
Against a Company at Sum
merland.
SANTA BARBARA. Jan. 19.â Judgft
Day to-day rendered his decision ln the
Superior Court in the case of the San
Francisco Savings Union vs. the R. O. Q.
Petroleum and Minlncr Company of Sum
merland. The decision is for the plain
tiff and is of wide reaching importance to
owners of uplands upon the ocean beach
of California. It enables littoral or ripari
an owners on the beach to keep the water
front free from nuisances created in the
nature of oil derricks, platforms, wharves
and other structures built by locators on
lands of the State below high water
mark.
The suit was brought to enjoin the erec
tion of platforms and wharves. Judire
Day sustains the injunction and render*
judgment for plaintiff on the ground that
anything obstructing the owners of ripari
an rights from the freo use of navigable
waters and the beach is a nuisance.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 19.â "When Broughton"s
franchise bill comes up before the Assem
bly committee next Tuesday its consider
ation will be. postponed for some days to
allow the Los Angeles delegation, which
will lead the opposition to the measure,
to arrive with proposed amendments. This
was the purpose of Ferd K. Rule's visit
here last evening, and having secured a
promise of postponement he left for San
Francisco this" morning by an early train.
It was not Mr. Rule's original intention
to come to Sacramento. He was bound
from Ik)s Angeles to San Francisco, but
when the gravity of the situation became
apparent to the companies he represents
they telegraphed him to proceed to Sac
ramento without delay.
The delegation from Los Angeles will be
up some time in the latter part of next
week. They have been furnished copies
of the bill and have been busy picking out
its defects and arranging amendments
that will make its provisions just and
equitable.
The southern delegation to the Legisla
ture is in a state of uncertainty regarding
just what course to take, as so far the
opponents of the bill have done nothing
more than to. condemn the bill and ask
for delay until they can get here. It was
believed that there was opposition to the
bill itself, and it amounted to practically
that at first, but it has been authorita
tively stated that there is no opposition
to a franchise biiv; and that the most the
delegations to arrive will do Is* to object to
its provisions and submit amendments to
them. When these amendments have all
gone in It is not probabie that there will
be much of the original bill left, for out
of the ten sections it will be sought to
amend seven in vital particulars. Of the
other three one relates to forfeiture sales,
one to punishments for violating 1 the pro
vlsionB of the act and the third repeals
acts in conflict with itself. Whenever the
bill refers to franchises, however, it fur
nishes a field for a luxuriant crop of
amendments, that promise to leave little
but the section numbers.

HUMAN FOLLY!
THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF WIDESPREAD, DESTRUCTIVE
EFFECTS THAT DAILY DRIVE VICTIMS
To Seek Cure of Varicocele, Stricture, Nervo-
Sexual Debility, Blood Poison and
Various Genito-Urinary Diseases.
THE PEER OF 20TH CENTURY SPECIALISTS,
The fruits of human folly, growing out of specific offenses agralnst nature and
of contagious Blood Poison, are conspicuously manifest ln an assembly of mal-
adies which rob man of health and manhood of power.
He whose feeble will ln youth afforded no protection to developing: manhood
or permitted the acquirement of Blood Poison, later ln life dl3covera himself ta
be the victim of one or more of the vitality-sapping Infirmities so prevalent ln
In this train of evils are Varicocele, Stricture, Nervo-Sexual Debility, Prostatlc
Disease Periodical or Contracted Vital Dralnagre. the Paralysis of Specific Blood
Poison and a number of sympathetic or or reflex nervous maladies.
Untold thousands of men. dismayed by the failure of insufficient treatment to
afford them escape from their partictilar affliction, have become resigned to their
apparent fate and a vast army of others ln the early grasp of decline would give
almost anything on earth in their possession to know where they may obtain
curÂ©
The acknowledged leader in the ranks of true Specialism of the twentieth cen-
tury Is F. L. Sweany, M. D.. who fnr more than a score of years has Â«mece<jÂ« fully
combated the various forms of NERVOUS. CHRONIC ami SPECIFIC DISEASE*
Legions of men constantly carry intheir hearts unspeakable pratltnfle to him
for b!s masterful cure of their special -WEAKNESSES and DISEASES and for the
complete restoration of their health and Natural Powers.

Longest Established Most Successful and
Reliable Specialist in Diseases off Men.
My exhaustive study of man ln health and in dlseaae ha* enabled me to evorre
my own methods of conquering disease and my profound devotion to the Specialty
of "Dlsenses Peculiar to Men" haa siven me the mastery of Special and Spedfle
male maladies.
WADIPDPCI 1 I cure to stay cured by a painless, rapid, safe and reliable method
VnnluUuLLuof my own origination, by the use of which I spare thÂ» Varicocele
patient the risks and suffering incident to the old-time. wtde-opÂ«n operation with
the knife. The varicose or diseased and dilated veins are contracted and
strengthened, their elasticity ls restored and normal circulation and nutrition of
important orpans become re-established. Thus Varicocele is cured and recovery
of health and power Immediately follows.
CTDIHTIIIC 1 cure by the use of special curative remedies, which qnlcXly d!s-
â¢ ?! ni * I Uflf. solve all unnatural and hardened stricture bands and cause their
absorption and removal, thus leaving the Urethra or Urinary Channel free for the
passage of urine and the secretions of the reproductive organs.
This treatment for Stricture ls a revelation In specialism. Those who> take ad-
vantage of this perfect means of cure are enabled to avoid the terrible suffering
caused by harsh. Bteel-sound treatment and cutting procedures, which to often en-
tall conditions worse than the original malady.
MCÂ£\/n QCYIIAI nCCjIl ITY ls a combined term which signifies a decline
lit- VU-onAUAL UCUlU \ I of force ln the greneral system and also a loss of
certain special functions and powers.
No matter what the cause, it ls always necessary in such cases to correct the
defects by supplying elements of power. This is the keynote of success ln thÂ»
treatment of Nervous and Seminal Debility. Premature Decline. Lost Power ana
other weaknesses included under the broad and sweeping term of Nervo-Sexual
Debility. The cure of these Infirmities singly or collectively Implies the restora-
tion of tone ln every organ of the body and the renewal ot the nerve impulse or
force which governs and controls all organs.
I solved this problem years ago by research alonir the line or animal chem-
istry, and my discovery was that of means by which I revitalize the powers of the
male organism so aa to cure any form or stage of Debility.
CDCPICIP Dl finn DniCniU ls cured by me without saturating the human
Or'ulr III DUHJU rUlcUH system with poisonous and destructive minerals,
which are so difficult for nature to remove from the tissues when once they have
been administered. My treatment for Blood Poison does not molest normal,
healthy tissues, but It has the wonderful property of antagonizing, destroying and
expelling blood poisons and blood taints.
SrQnnUA CUEIIM^TIQM and **Â»Â« countless skin diseases which are> due
nUrULfli " n L Um r) Mo ITl to blood poison yield to the Influence of my
treatment. The curative remedies which I use are purely botanical, possess won-
derful alterative, tonic and antl-toxlc properties and may be taken without Inter-
ruption until every drop of blood and every atom of tissue 1 ln the body is rendered
normal and pure.
COMPLICATING, ASSOCIATE AND REFLEX DISEASES.
Attending the principal affliction to be cured ls often some additional condition
or disease, which asyravates and favors the progress of the main malady.
I possess such skill that I am enabled to cure every disease which may have
associated Itself with or been caused by the original Infirmity or disease. 1 never
dismiss a case until cured in every particular to stay cured. This ia one secret
of my never falling to cure any man who applies to rne for treatment.
If the case be Varicocele. Stricture. Nervo-Sexual Decline or Prostatle Dis-
ease, and is complicated by Rupture, Hydrocele. Hemorrhoids (Piles), or other
rectal or pelvic diseases of any character. I always cure such additional malady
also, go that the cure may be perfect and permanent!
Reflex effects of all pelvic complaints are destructive to the tone of the vl'al
nerves, and often induce mental and nervous maladies, such as NEURASTHENIA
or NERVOUS EXHAUSTION", INSOMNIA and MELANCHOLY, sometimes AC-
TUAL INSANITY. . - w â â -^
No other human ills areso potent ln the dethronement of manhood as Vari-
cocele, Stricture, Prostatic Disease and other destructive maladies of the Oenlto-
Urinary system. -'â¢ Â¦ "-' ...
I understand the true nature of the causes and effects of these physical evil*,
and I have the requisite skill to restore all men victimized by their own folly or
by the innocent inheritance of blood taint. . â¢ -

Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-

It cures through the stomach diseases

CAtil. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA-
MENTO, Jan. 19.â Benjamin Ide "WTieeler,
president of tho State University, will ar-
rive here next Monday. He has been in-
vited to meet the Alameda delegation. In
accepting the Invitation ot the delegates
he said:
"I am ready and anxious to meet any
person, any body of persons, any commit-
tee or the whole Legislature, to frankly
discuss university affairs."
In connection with university topics, tha
fact ls mentioned that neither the Gov-
ernor nor the Controller has received a
financial report of the Institution for the
1 year 1900. The Controller ln his biennial
report for the two years ended June 80.
1900, fdves figures showing the revenue de-
rived by the university from the one cent
tax authorized in 1887 and the additional
one cent tax authorized in 1S97. Receipt*
for the fiftieth fiscal year amounted to
$219.058 41; for the fifty-first fiscal year,
I236.3SD 39. Apart from this tax the uni-
versity gets the interest on H.959.U4 (H,
that sum being the amount in the con-
solidated perpetual endowment fund. Tnls
fund consists of the following.
Bonds $Â«95.000 00
Mortpaffes S31.821 93

Total $1,959.114 04
In 1SS0 it was discovered that the State
Controller had U3ed $73,750 which belongs!
to the State University. By an act of the
Legislature of March 4. 1SS1. the 3tat-s
was authorized to pay the university <i
per cent interest on this sum until such
time as the principal should be paid. That
interest Is now being orawn on under the
title of "diverted funds."
The Controller in his last report directs
attention to tho fact that the money in
the consolidated perpetual nndowment
fund is controlled exclusively by the
Board of Regents, although into this fund
is paid the interest on bonds held in trust
by the State Treasurer for the benefit of
the university.

HOUSE CONSIDERS
THE POSTAL BILL
The delay in the publication of the en
cyclical on "Christian Democracy," which
caused a great deal of comment, was thus
explained yesterday by Cardinal Agllardi,
who has been assisting his Holiness in its
preparation: - -
"At the last Vatican reception I asked
the Pope when he expected to be able to
give the encyclical to the world. He re
plied he had considei'ed it necessary to
Introduce several further modifications in
order to, make it clearer and to leave no
room for conflicting interpretations. We,
await," added his Holiness, "a favorable
moment for publication. Affairs in the
French Chamber keep us very â¢ preoccu
pied. We must have a little patience*.".
Cardinal ARliardi's personal -opinion is
that the encyclical will not : be published
until -the . question now at issue between
the Vatican and the French Government
and Chamber of Peputies is settled.
The Pope spoke an hour and a half.
After the reception each Cardinal as he
left was observed to have a folded paper
sealed heavily with the papal arms. These
mysterious proceedings, which naturally
aroused the deepest interest, are consum
ing Kcnve with curiosity, ln the hope of
throwing some llcht on the matter a call
was' made on Cardinal Macchi, who Is
usually the most affable and accessible
of the Prince" 3 Church, but bis Eminence
absolutely declined to say a word on the
subject. The private secretary of one of
tho members of the sacred college, while
not professing to speak with authority,
expressed the opinion that the document
contained the Pope's political testament â
that is to say, set forth his views as to
his successor and the policy of the church
in matters in the immediate future. The
document will not be opened until after
Leo XIIl's death.
The report current ln Vatican circles Is
to the effect that the Pope, on handing
the paper to each Cardinal, merely re
marked that the seal would be Droken at
his demise, which he had no reason to
suppose would be delayed beyond this
year, and that, in view of the gravity of
the outlook for the church, it will be pre
pared for a conclave. Messengers left
Rome Tuesday wi-h documents for foreign
Cardinals throughout Christendom.
ROME, Jan. 19.â Exceptional Importance
was attached by the Vatican to the recep
tion last Tuesday by the Pope, unusual
precautions being taken to maintain so-,
crecy as to the proceedings. Two days
previous Cardinal Rampolla, Papal Secre
tary of State, sent a note to all the Car
dinals urging on them the necessity of at
tending, as the Pope was desirous of mak
ing- a communication of exceptional grav
ity. Consequently none of the twenty-five
Cardinals who were then in Rome was
absent, even Monslgnor Oreglla, Paxocchi
and Ledochowskl, all of whom have been
on the sick list for some time, managing
to be present. Only the Cardinals and hia
Holiness were present.- Even the trusted
officers of the papal household, who or
dinarily are present on these occasions,
were excluded Tuesday.

MANILA. Jan. 19.â The section of the
municipal code relating to the qualifica
tions, of electors was much discussed to
day before the Philippine Commission,
The bill requires voters to own real estate
to the value of 600 peso*, or to pay taxes
to the amount of SO pesos and upward,
and be males of upward of 28 years of
age, who speak, read and write English
or Spanish. All are required to swear al
legiance to the United States.
Judge Taft, president of the commission,
promised to amend the bill so as to In
clude men paying 20 pesos taxes.
Buencamlna and other Federal party
leaders object to the feature empowering
the provincial governors to determine the
legality of the elections of the local of
ficers.
The effect of the section covering the
taxation of church properties will be to
largely put the assessment ln country dis
tricts on persons to whom friars have
nominally transferred the largre tracts of
land which they formerly claimed to own.
The friars left all the country districts
during the disturbed periods. Large hold
ings of land and business property la
Manila are owned directly by the church,
and as a similar provision for the taxation
of church properties will be Included ln a
separate bill for the civil government of
Manila, that question will then be more
directly at issue.
Lieutenant Morrison was a native of
Iowa and was graduated ln the military
academy in June, 1896. He was assigned
to the Third Cavalry and served with that
regiment ln the campaign ag-atn*t Santi
ago. In February. 1900, a few months after
he had reached the grade of first lieuten
ant, he was transferred to the Fourth
Cavalry and served with that regiment ln
the Philippine Islands up to the time of
his death.

PARIS, Jan. 19.â A tragic Incident oc
curred at the College of France this af
ternoon. A young Russian girl student,
Vera Gelo, tried to assassinate an aged
professor. Senator Emllft Deschanel. fath
er of the president of the Chamber of
Deputies. The professor had Just con
cluded a lecture on French literature
when Vera Gelo, who was one of the au
dience, pointed a revolver at him. Her
friend, another Russian student, noticing?
the movement, sacrificed herself by Inter
vening and received a bullet In the chest.
She fell at Professor Deschanel's feet,
bleeding profusely. Vera Gelo was ar
rested. It appears she is mentally de
ranged. She said Professor Deschanel
had slandered her and added, ln heart
broken tones: "I have wounded my
friend."

prostration been so conservatively treated
in the newspapers as here, where It Is of
the most vital Importance^ The papers,
like her subjects, hesitate to speak plainly
of the fears oppressing them regarding
the Queen. The headlines of moat of the
afternoon papers to-day were confined to
non-committal words in big type, like
"Her Majesty's Condition," but the. news
venders were doing tremendous business
with every edition. It was a gloomy day
for London. The anxiety on every face
from the East End workman to the fre
auenters of the St. James Club comported
with the drizzling rain. London's com
ment on yesterday's official statement was
that it might mean little or much. The
bulletin of to-day forced the conviction
on the nubile mind that it meant much.
The officials told the newspaper corre
spondents that they hoped for the best,
but their manner showed they feared the
worst. Withal, the intelligence ( dld not
surprise people. The unanimous e-omment
was that they feared it. While thvÂ» Queen
was wonderfully strong physically for her
age, the cares and sorrows not only of
the war but arising from the death of
her grandson In South Africa and of her
favorite lady In waiting. Lady Churchill,
at Christmas, affected her vitally, and the
empire awaited the news from Osborne
with the keenest suspense, in memory of
the Queen's subjects.
The Xlcaragua treaty was never rated
in the public mind here as an issue of
overwhelming importance. It was com
pletely forgotten before the supreme
topic. But to-day's developments confirm
the forecasts, and the Cabinet Is likely to
hold the question under consideration dur
ing several meetings. In the meantime
the chief desire of Englishmen appears to
be for an amicable settlement.
Petition Withdrawn.
LONDON. Jan. 19.â The petition re

Ing up of the affairs of the London and

BERLIN , Jan. 19.â The Prussian bi
centenary celebrations drove out for a
time, almost completely, public Interest
for anything else. The Socialist and
part of the ultra-Radical press made an
attempt to show that the fetes were pure
ly dynastic, but this Is not- true. The-!
liagein;? and decorating throughout fier- j
Un, even In the poorest laborers' houses, j
and the general Illuminating last even- '
ing proved the contrary, as also did the !
Immense crowds thronging the streets (
until midnight. Among the fla^s the i
German tri-color predominated largely, i
the Prussian white and black being &een j
only occasionally. The Kreuz Keltung\ !
which Is narrowly .Prussian, deplores '
this, saying-: "In a similar fete in Sax- i
ony or Bavaria the Saxon or Bavarian
flags would appear in the majority."
About the Emperor's address of Thurs- i
day to the officers, an official who was
present says that his Majestv empha
sized that during the 200 years of their ex- !
Istence the Prussian Kings had often j
been forced to draw the sword to be
come what they are to-day. The Prus- I
sian officers' corps, he added, had a large
Â¦ban in this Ion? combat for Prussia's
I greatness and power, but now, when Ger- 1
, many and Prussia's main tasks are the '
maintenance of peace, it has become the
principal duty for the Prussian officers' !
corps to develop the army in all which ;
braces the body and soul. The army, he !
continued, was also the best school for i
monarchic sentiment and a strict fulfill- !
ment of duty. j
Part of the press to-day criticizes Em
peror William's rescripts to the navy and
army, the Socialistic Vorwaerts point
ing out that, in spita of hia Majesty's
claim that the army is the best support
of the state, there was a time when the
army and state miserably foundered.
Anent the navy rescripts the Vor
waerts says: "Since the Emperor now
openly acknowledges he wants to make
the navv as formidable a weapon as the
army, the Emperor must have another,
further-reaching-, programme for navy
expansion."
It became known to-day that Emperor
William yesterday afternoon, while driv
ing, ran into a heavy cart, injuring a lad,
Herman Linde, who was driving-. Al
though the fault lay with the driver of
the cart, his Majesty sent him a hand
some present.
From an unexceptionable source it Is
learned that Germany, neither in the past
nor In the future, has Interposed or will
offer any obstacle to Russia's claim on
Manchuria. Count von Bulow has given
the Russian Embassador repeated assur
ances since ths beginning of the Chines*
troubles, and quite recently again, that
Manchuria lies out of Germany's lnter
commerclal sphere and that it Is no way
touched on by the Anglo-German agree
ment.
The project of a net of cables to cover
the world Is being diligently pursued by
Germany and is most actively furthered
by the Emperor, who made some signifi
cant utterances on the subject to Privy
Postal Counselor Streiker recently. The
latest shape of the project so' far as the Far
East Is concerned is as follows: Germany
and the Netherlands are Jointly to lay a
cable which will go through the Dutch
Indies, touching at the Natunas Islands,
Billotln, Palemburg, Batavia, Macassar,
German New Guinea and the Carolines,
with a central point at Shanghai, then
branching from Klaochau easterly ft Ja^
pan and America. The Dutch Government
will lay the cable through its own colo
nies and Germany will do the rest. The
financing of this project is about consti
tuted.
In principle the plan of General von
Podbielskl, the Imperial Postmaster Gen
eral, for gradually raising the annual ap
propriations to a maximum of 6,000.000
marks in 1902 has been approved by Em
peror William, but If private companies
with a estate subvention will undertake
the work the Postmaster General will not
object
Another misunderstanding has arisen
with Bavaria. Prince Alphonse. nephew
of the Prince Regent, who attended the
funeral of the Grand Duke of Saxe-
Weimar, who died January 5, claims he
was snubbed by the Emperor's represent
atives. General von "Willlch and Prince
Regent Albrecht, etiquette and questions
of precedence being involved. On return
ing to Bavaria. Prince Alphonse resigned
command of the First Bavarian Cavalry
Brigade, with the approval of the Prince
Regent, who conferred on him a higher
but inactive rank and also bestowed on
him the highest decoration.
Foreign Office officials here know noth
ing of the alleged telegram from Em
peror Kwang Bu to the Embassadors re
garding the occupation of the Taku forts,
but they say the Chinese Commissioners
ha\-e written to the Embassadors ex
pressing certain wishes, which will be dis-
CUSBed during the peace negotiations.
The Foreign Office discredits the state
ment that fresh German troops are '.bout
to be sent to China for the relief of sick 1
wounded and returned soldiers. Only slip- '
plies for the troops will be sent hereafter.
No plans exist for the withdrawal of the
German troops or the return of Field Mar- i
shal Count von Waldersee. ' Â¦ |
Germany has no plans In this connection
apart from the powers, and will. not take
independent action. How long the Ger
man troops will remain In China depend*
upon the Chinese themselves. ;
Project for a Net of Cables
to Cover the World Is
Diligently Pursued.

It is therefore, with 'minds freed from any fears of political disturbance that the British
people will read the bulletins of the sick room,. and in their sorrow for the'failing Queen they will
have the sympathy of the rest of the civilized world: BBS !
VICTORIA, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress of India, has been for so long
a time identified with British sovereignty that men of this generation will find it difficult to
think of any one else in that position. To the popular imagination she has been for many
years something like an abstraction, a, part of the government rather than a mortal woman. She
% has been for so long a time in virtual retirement so far as social functions are concerned that her
name is associated mainly with grand ceremonials, and few Jiave ever taken the trouble to fore
cast what changes would be likely to occur when in the course of nature she closes a reign the
longest in the, annals of British history and goes to rest with her predecessors in the tomb.
The bulletins that are now being issued from Osborne have changed her relations to her
kingdom and to the world. The public sees her now a feeble old woman near to death's door,
and the sympathy that goes out to her will be that which is instinctive to the human heart, and
which in its tender pulsations knows no difference between royalty and democracy.
Should the death of the Queen occur it would make little difference to international pol
itics, or even to her own nation, for the time has long gone by when British politics and for
eign policies were to any considerable extent dependent upon the personality of the sovereign.
The chief political effect of her death would be the dissolution of Parliament and the election of a
new one. It is not likely, however, that the result of the election would materially, alter the Gov
ernment, for Salisbury has so recently been given a new lease of; power it is not likely he would
be defeated in the new contest.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
The country will be glad that Mr. Quay returns to the Senate by action of the Legislature
of Pennsylvania, and not on the Governors appointment. He lost something in public interest
when he attempted to return to his seat over the ruins of Senatorial precedent and constitutional
provision. But, like Clark, he fairly won out in his State, and natural politics required his regu
lar return. In these elections the Republicans lose Carter in Montana and Shoup in Idaho. Turn
ing to Colorado, Wolcott goes down before the Populist Patterson, so that three seats go to the
opposition.' The balance will be restored and more by Republicans elected in South Dakota, Ne
braska, Kansas and Utah.
A very interesting side light to Clark's victory is the defeat of Senator Chandler of New
Hampshire. During last winter's investigation' of Clark's first election Chandler, for the Commit
tee on Privileges and Elections, pursued him with an energy which soon degenerated into per
sonal rancor. To such an extent was this carried that members of the. committee, though op
posed to seating Clark, were equally opposed to Chandler's conduct and methods. He has long
been at feud with his colleague, Dr. Gallinger, and it is very probable that New Hampshire is re
lieved that he is retired to exploit his growing irascibility of temper in private life '
Clark of Montana is a man whom the country Is likely to respect more upon further
acquaintance. He is really a man of qualities and accomplishments. Granted that he took Mon
tana politics as he found it and by no means made it more vestal, yet he has won at the polls bv his
own force, and the country will think better of him that he thanks Bryan for nothing except
a covert opposition. This was manifested through the president of the National Association of
Bryan Clubs, who in the midst of the campaign expelled Mr. Clark from the position of treasurer
of that organization and elected to the place his great rival, Marcus Daly. This was intended to
weaken Clark in Montana, but it had the opposite effect. /
The natural choice of Idaho would have been Governor Steunenberg. Indeed, it may be
said that, so far, no public man has appeared in the intermountain region who isÂ«his peer in char
acter, courage and ability. But Bran considers no interest but his own, and has dictated the re
turn to the Senate of Dubois, who served there before without impression upon that body or the
THE election of the members of the next Senate so far is largely the happening of the
expected. Quay, Clark and Dubois were so securely slated before the November electfon
that their choice is simply a ratification. The selection of Dubois has features that make
it not creditable to Idaho. It was dictated by Colonel Bryan last summer. The Silver Republi
can element of that State made pilgrimage to- Bryan in Chicago, and made his indorsement of
Dubois the price of supporting him for President. Towne had just been crowded out of the Vice
Presidential race and something had to be done to conciliate the Silver Republicans; so Idaho
was traded as boys swap jackknives, and Mr. Bryan issued his rescript electing Dubois.
THE SENATORS-ELECT.
The time has gone by when the subject can be dismissed by criticism of the communities in
which- these things occur. Indeed, one is led to confess that burning at the stake is liable to ap

In the more cheerful view it must be admitted that a large part of the blacks have not only
not parted with the civilizing effect of slavery, but have grown and gone forward into the better
civilization of liberty. With such members of the race as Booker T. Washington and Thomas For
tune, as an example of its capacity, the country should not sit, down in despair of advancing the
whole negro body to a point at which it will have none in its ranks capable of the horror which
leads white men to the horror of retaliation.
It cannot be denied that a portion of the negro population is becoming less civilized than
when in slavery. A portion of our black people are retrograding. They are exhibiting the same
atavism that appeared in Hayti and San Domingo and among the maroons of Jamaica.
Colorado in fact and Kansas virtually abolished the death penalty a few years ago, and
the Governors. of the two States assign that as the cause of these awful lynchings, and say that if
the death penalty were restored they would not occur, and the people would be willing for the law
to take its course. We do not regard this conclusion as sound. Negroes have been burned in
Texas, Alabama and other States where the death penalty is in force, and there is no assurance that
it would be different' in Kansas and Colorado. The commission of the crime for which lynching
is the popularly accepted punishment is an outbreak of the brutal among the negroes. When a
radical remedy is sought it must be sought among them. Lynching, no matter under what re
lentless and horrible circumstances, is no remedy, as is* proved by the constant recurrence of the
crime notwithstanding the certainty and severity of its punishment. We see no reliable remedy
except the elevation and advancement of the whole body of negroes.
No more unpleasant subject has ever been forced upon public attention than these lynch
ings. The incidents are revolting and horrible, from the commission of the crime to its awful ex
piation. Nearly a dozen burnings at- the stake have now occurred, and it promises in such cases
to substitute all other forms of lynching for the offense it is intended to punish.
THE Colorado horror has been matched by the burning- to death of a negro in Kansas at
Leavenworth. The compunction shown by the cremators in Kansas was less than that of
their predecessors in Colorado. In the latter case the negro confessed his crime. The
Leavenworth negro was identified as having attempted an assault, but the scene of his offense was
in the vicinity where, a white woman was found atrociously murdered two months ago. He stoutly
denied to the last his guilt of the murder. But he was taken to the spot where the murdered girl
was found and then bound with wire to an iron stake, he was soaked in kerosene, the father 'of the
murdered girl applied the torch and in a few minutes he was dead.
THE KANSAS LYNCHING.
Between dramatic writers who in many
respects differ so widely as Dryden and
Dumas fils there is In one respect a cu
rlous likenessâ that their robust critical
sense often leads. them to put into the
prefaces to their plays better material
than they put into the playe themselves.
I was forcibly reminded of this the other
day when looking over the new and de
finitive edition of Dumas' works, recently
published by Cs'.mann Lev?-. In the re
vised preface to "Le Demi-Monde" Dumas
!s writing about the attempt of M. Leon
Fancher to Improve the morals of the
Ftage by offering a prize of 5000 francs for
a play "of euch a nature that it shall sup
ply instruction to the laboring classes by
the propagation of healthy ideas and the
spectacle cf g-ood examples." "This," says
Dumas, "was perfectly absurd. To draw
up a programme of this kind one needs to
be as ignorant of art matters as was M.
Fancier. "What kind of an art work Is
that, 'represented with success at Paris'
or elsewhere, which shall be 'of such a
nature that it shall supply instruction to
the laboring classes by the propagation of
healthy Ideas and the spectacle of good
examples'? Is art, especially theatric art,
charged with purifying the morals of the
laborirg classes? Does not art address
Itself especially to the Intelligence, the
feeling, the Judgment of the educated and
the refined? Show me a masterpiece, rec
ognized as such, which could obtain M.
Far.cher's prize. Shall It be Tartufe,'
'Kamiet.' 'LeMariage de Figaro.' "Phedre,"
'Athalie,' 'Le Misanthrope,' 'Polyeucte'?
Are they of a nature to -supply Informa
tion to the laboring- classes by the propa
gation of healthy Ideas? Will these
classes understand these masterpieces?
I suggest to the Tlvoli management a
Gilbert and Sullivan revival, the operas
to be given in chronological order. That
Â¦would be a blessed relief after De Kovei
and Smith.
The more you hear Sullivan's music,
the better It wears. No other composer.
French or German, has ever turned out
more good work in light opera than has
he. The comparison between Sullivan
end Mozart, suggested bv Vernon Black
burn, Is certainly net far-fetched and the
eulogy pronounced upon his work by Sir
<j<"orge Grove will appeal, I am sure, to
many as absolutely true: "Form and

rhythm and melody clothe everything he
Touches: the music shows not only sympa

M. Isaacs has a sympathetic and
well written article on the late
Sir Arthur Sullivan, That tal

The Paris Figaro recently published a
list of the members of the Comedle Fran
caise, from which we learn that the so
cletaires now number twenty-six, seven
teen of whom are gentlemen and nine
ladles. The penslounaires number thirty
â twelve gentVemen and eighteen ladies.
This makes the total of the company
fifty-sixâ all thoroughly trained and com
petent actors, no one of whom is required
to play more than three or four times a
Â¦week and each one of whom has, there
fore, timo to breathe, to eat, to sleep, to
read and even to think! Can you^ imagine
such an existence, you my friends of the
profession in America, who have to play
nine times a weekâ sometimes twelveâ In
addition to rehearsing three or four hours
every day? Is it credible by you that
such an actorial paradise can exist, not
only in the wild Imaginings of poets, not
only In the dreams of the happy dead,
but aJso on this poor old worn-out earth
of ours? Whether you can imagine or be
lieve it or not it does exist in Paris and
it could just as easily exist in the United
States. It exists In Paris because a large
majority of the French people are willing
to tax themselves that the drama may be
supported in a manner dignified and
worthy as a fine art; it does not exist in
the United States because of the many
rich men who last year gave away a total
of $00,000,000 not one cared enough about
the drama to give it 6 cents.
Madeline Lucette H-yley. authoress of
this and many other good plays, has res
urrected from history the romantic story
of Savage's alleged inhuman mother, who
persecuted her illegitimate son. Like Dr.
Johnson, the biographer of Savage, she
has accepted as true the remarkable story
the vagabond poet delighted to relate, of
that strange mother, a "wretch who had.
without scruple, proclaimed herself an
adultress, and who had first endeavored
to starve her son, then to transport him,
and afterward to hong him." as Dr. John
son says. Although history mid Boswell
discredit this story and pronounce Savage
a vagabond impostor, winning sympathy
and aid by this extravagant yarn, it
makes a 'very striking background for a
costume parlor melodrama of that period.
Mrs. Ryley has taken the most favorable
view of the poet, and presents him as a
character sympathetic, lovable, admira
ble â in fact, a perfect dashing hero ready
to avenge his wrongs with a flashing
sword, make love like a gallant cavalier
to the girl of his choice and die like a
martyr in the end.
The following- account of Henry Mil
ler's new play, "Richard Savage," is from
the Washington Post:
Will they come to see them when repre
sented? And can such masterpieces be
turned out for 5000 francs? Five thousand
francs! Why not some bread tickets or a
perpetual registration at the charity of
fice for the poet and his family? â¢ â¢ â¢ If
you wish to establish money prizes for lit
erature, establish prizes worthy of the
artist and of yourselves, which shall not
be like the prizes you give to Jockeys.
Give two, three, five hundred thousand
francs, not to the most moral work, but
to the most beautifulâ that which Is abso
lutely beautiful being never immoral;
know that oneÂ© for all. The first condi
tion of genius Is sincerity, and that which
is sincere Is always chaste. The emotion
caused by the painting of a true passion,
Â¦whatever be the order of that passion,
from the moment that It Is expressed in
beautiful language, translated into beau
tiful movement. Is worth more than all
the ready-made tirades you demand from
us at cost price, like scaled proposals for
municipal works; and this emotion will
make man moral In far different fashion,
forcing him to iook Â¦within himself, bring
ing to the surface his mysterious, hidden
thoughts and stirring up the depths of
human nature. * â¢ â¢ "Tls your duty,
leaders of society, 'tis your duty, all who
make public profession and place your
pelves above others, to enlighten the la
boring classes, to give them good exam
ples and to Instruct thorn so that they
shall prefer our harmless works to that
dangers of the tavern, the slums and all
the bad places you authorize. Purify tho
morals of others and your own at the
same time; then we painters of morals
will paint pure morals. Aristophanes is

ES Nordau Is comfortably dis
tant, though not yet decently
dead, one may venture to
give again a discreet, small
wave to the red rag of a "leit
motiv" without fear* of being
compelled to Â»make vicarious
argumentative atonement for the virtues
of Wagner In this direction. It Is only a
very small wave, however, but It oc
curred to me the other day that had Wag
ner chosen to give expression to Mile.
Dolores' "characteristic theme" he would
simply have anticipated a few merry
measures of the "Laughing Song" she
sings so well, for the singer of sorrowful
name herself seems laughter Incarnate.
I found her the other day. after a long
recital, entertaining with an admirable
good humor the usual behind-the-scenes
crowd of worshipers. For my part. I was
there for a chat with the singer about
herself and the recent musical happening
In the East, but a person with the autog
raph habit had precedence of me and my
small concerns.
"Where shall I write?" Inquired Tre
belll. smiling at the autograph hunter In
her infectious fashion.
"Here, If you will." said the delighted
autogTapher, unfolding an ambiguous af
fair In linen about the size of a large ta
blecloth, and scrawled all over with dis
tinguished names embroidered In silk.
"Here Is Nordlca and Schumann-Helnk
and Strauss â no. not there â here with
Maurice Grau," the autographer directed.
And the prima donna, with no more ado
than the smallest of small girls, knelt
down In her pretty finery before a travel-
Ing trunk, smoothed out the creased linen
and wroteâ not "Dolores" but her own and
mother's name. "Antoinette TrebelU."
There Is the same charming simplicity
about everything she does. She sings be
cause she loves to sing, In the same frank,
simple, whole-hearted fashion. And she
looks that way. A sonsle. bonnle face,
with the clearest blue eyes Imaginable,
the merriest smile, and round cheeks ut
terly innocent of "make-up." she im
presses one with a delightful sense of
health and wholesomeness. After the
autograph incident she turned to me, and
I began hurriedlyâ having forgotten my
errand:
"Well, mademoiselle. I had a. thousand
things to askâ"
"Ask them," she laughed.
"Do you stay long 1 here this time, to
beÂ«rin with?" .
"We go to Ix)s Angeles on Sunday, but
return here to give some recitals in Feb
ruary," said the singer. "Then we go to
Australia, my third visit, and then on a
delightful trip to India. Sumatra and all
sorts of place?. I do not come here for
three years more after that. I think, or
you will be tired of me. and I do not want
that, for San Francisco Is a charming 1
city."
"You come now from the East, made
moiselle?"
"Yes. and I have Just heard Jean de
Reszke again on his reappearance In New
York. Ah! there is an artist!"
"It Is not true, then, about his voice
failing?"
"Bah! no!" and for the first time a lit
tle frown appeared on Dolores' face. "He
is wonderful." and she clasped her hands
with a frank enthusiasm. "It was
'Lohengrin,' Nordlca was In the cast.
Schumann-Heink was In the east.
Edouard de Reszke was In the cast, but
when Jean came on the stager-nobody
was there but him. It Is not the voice,
so much, but art; all art. Wonderful!"
"You are generous, mademoiselle: but
let us hear what Jean de Reszke has to
say about you."
"Ah! he does not know, probably, that
there is any I," laughed Dolores.
"We had all the Grau people out here,"
I proudly Informed the singer.
"Yes, that was splendid." she said.
"Nordlca, you must like herâ with her ex
cellent art, -though not so perfect voice?
Wagner Is cruel to the singers, but it is
beautiful music. Then Schumann-Helnk,
that splendid temperament, and Melbaâ
ah:â that is the perfect voice."
"Some found her cold here," I ventured,
"not that I am of them."
"Well, no one can be perfect. Not any
one is perfect. But so clear, so pure a
voice as Melba's, one must thank God for
It," the singer replied simply.
"We have wondered sometimes,
mademoiselle, that you, yourself, did not
go on the stage?"
"Ah.-no!" she replied. "The concert
room is better. It is true. I was edu
cated for the stage, but you know how
It isâ one may be a saint on the stage, but?
nobody will believe it Generally, that is.
And I am freer this way. I sing the
songs I please, go where I choose and no
one says me nay."
"You sins so many charming old Eng
lish songs, mademoiselle, and speak Kngr
llsh so well; also French, also Italian:
which are you?"
"My mother was . French, my father
Italian, and I learned English in Eng
land," laughed the â¢artist. "My new
name. Doloresâ you know, I charged my
name because people Imagined I was my
own mother!â was that of my grand
mother." 'Â¦
And then, before leave-taking. Mile.
Trebelll told me that she takes with her
to Australia as accompanist and solo
pianist, a talented young Callfornlan,
Robert Clarence Newell. Mr. Newell is a
pupil of that eccentric Bostonlan. Alvah
Glover Salmon, who came out here in
search of health some years ago. He has
been occupied in playing and teaching the
piano in Oakland, also presiding over the
choir and organ of St. Paul's Church
there and conducting the Orpheus Glee
Club.
Mile, TrebelH Is in excellent voice this
time. Her already exceptionally large
repertoire has been enlarged and she is
singing with all that admirable freedom,
certainty, purity of method and sympathy
which has always distinguished her work.
From Tschalkowsky to Purcell, from
Handel to Chaminade, from Verdi to
Grieg, singer seems equally at home
and any of her recitals is an admirable
object lesson for the singer. Mr. Newell's
accompaniments are characterized by a
nice discretion and restraint and his solo
work, while evincing yet some lack of

Heggerty Makes a Mistake.
Charles H. Myer. a druggist of New
York, on a visit to this city, appeared be
fore Judge Cabanips yesterday on a
charge of attempting to commit grand
larceny. Myer was at the fistic exhibi
tion at Woodward's Pavilion Friday night
and during the excitement occasioned by
a possible knockout in the Root-Byers
controversy, he, among others, rose from
their seats to leave. Robert D. Heg
gerty, saloon-keeper, 105 Sansome street,
was among the number, and he . claimed
that some one attempted to extract his
diamond pin. He pointed out Myer to
Policeman Scully and Myer was arrested.
Heggerty refused to prosecute the case
yesterday, as he confessed he was mis
taken, and the Judge dismissed the case.
The greatest interest in California oil
fields continues to be centered in Kern
River, while the other districts have
prominence according to their demon
strated productiveness. The Standard Oil
Company is, seemingly, as much con
cerned in that section as any one can be.
A local writer reports that at least 100
men are laying pipe for the great con
cern in the Kern River district, and that
the company "Is moving heaven and earth
to criss-cross the district with pipe lines."
Thc Standard Oil has already secured
many rights of way, and owners continue
to sign. To what extent the owner parts
with his own right to lay pipe on his
property appears to be debatable. At
least there is considerable talk at Bakers
field on that point. While the Kern dis
tricts have the center of the stage the
claim is advanced for the Summerland
district that it is one. of the most favor
able points for oil operators, principally
because of the small expense entailed in
handling the business. The truth is that
good things can be justly said of all the
producing districts.
The experiment has been successfully
tried in the Kern River district of using
drive pipe. A company failed twice in at
tempts to drill with casing.
Local interest in oil developments is
manifested by the second oil exchange to
be established and also by the rumor that
two new journals devoted to "the oil in
dustry will come into existence.
The Los Angeles oil men are in trouble
concerning a city license on the local oil
wells. Wht-n the tax was new Us pur
pose was to provide for the payment of an
oil Inspector. The collections during .the
term of Inspector Monlux amounted to
$14,270. while the expense of maintaining
the office was only about half that sum
leaving $T000 net to the city. There is
some talk of going to law to have the tax
removed.
The filings on oil land in Carriso Creek
district, In San Diego County, now amount
to nearly 100,000 acres. The claims are
somewhat scattered.
Stocks of oil in Kern County are in
creasing, notwithstanding that many cars
have been brought in from Eastern lines.
Thirty carloads per day go out from the
Kern River field.; At McKittrick several
companies are overloaded > with surplus
oil and tankage is lacking. The double
capacity tank cars that the Southern Pa
cific Company will soon have in use are
expected. to materially help in getting the
product of Kern County to market. These
double capacity cars will carry 13,000 gal
lons each. The- lenpth of the cars will be
.forty feet on the floor, the tanks being
two feet shorter.

County, Arizona, is about to be* exploited

LINCOLN LEAGUE MAKES
READY TO CELEBRATE
School Children Are Invited to Honor
. the Memory of the Great x
Emancipator.
The executive board of the Lincoln
League met yesterday afternoon in Judge
Cooney's office and'listened to pleasing re
ports concerning the proposed participa
tion of the school children of California
in the approaching Lincoln day observ
ances. Judge Cooney, "William Burgess,
Dr. Fred Baird and \V. F. Howe reported
that they had waited upon Mrs. Kincald,
president of the Board of Education, and
aleo on Superintendent Webster, and that
they had been assured that an effort
would be made to further the plans of
the league. A circular will be issued to
school principals during the present week
in reference to the matter. A letter was
read that had been received from Lieu
tenant Governor Neff. dated at Sacra
mento. In part the letter is as follows:
"I am Informed that the feeling here is
quite general in favor of your proposi
tion, and I believe that a -general move
by the superintendents of the schools all
over the State will make the celebration
of Lincoln day a success. I have con
versed with a number of members of the
Legislature and they all heartily indorse
the move that is being made in that direc
tion and promise to. aid all that they can
to further the enterprise."
President Stone reported that arrange
ments are making for details of veterans
from Lincoln, George H. Thomas, Meade
and Cass posts to visit schools on Lin
coln day. This example will be followed
very generally by the Grand Army posts
throughout the State. It was also re
ported that several artists have volun
teered to take part in the evening exer
cises at Metropolitan Hall, and there will
be choruses by the 'children of the Ever
ett and Burnett schools. Eight thousand
copies of a circular have been printed for
State Superintendent Kirk to be sent to
every school in the State.

dent and trustees. The report was
unanimously accepted and was ordered

bills now before the Legislature in the
Interests of the State University. Reso

BATTLES HARD FOR
HER CHILD'S LIFE
Mother Is Compelled to
Beat a Ferocious Dog
Into Insensibility.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Jan. 19.
Mrs. J. J. Manning had a desperate bat
tle this morning to save her child from a
vicious dog which had attacked the little
one with all the ferocity of a wild beast.
The child, a little boy 4 years of ag-e,
was playing with hiB mother in the yard
of their home at 818 Brush street when the
attack occurred. The dog, which is kept
chained on account of its ugly temper,
was feeding at the time, and. annoyed by
the child's running near his kennel, made
a savage rush at the little fellow. The
heavy chain by which the brute, was
fastened snapped and he sprang at the
child's throat.
Mrs. Manning screamed at the dog and
eelzed a stick 10 frighten him away, but
he paid no attention to her. The little
boy, as the beast rushed upon him,
fought blindly with hie naked hands, but,
of course, could do nothing. He was
j knocked down and frlghtfuly mangled
! about the fa^e. neck and hands. The fren
zied mother kept beating the dog about
the head with her utmost strength, but
not until she had almost stunned the
brute was she abie to drive him from his
victim. Then she caught up the child
and hurried to the Rcct-iving Hospital.
Steward Borchert cleansed the wounds
to prevent blood poisoning. In dressing
them it was found necessary to take sev
eral stitchep, especially in the right cheek.
The dog is a large, powerful animal and
has attacked several persons previously
to Its almost fniectpsful attempt on the
life of its young master.
The child's parents have heretofore val
ued the animal because it so effectually
protected the premises from thieves.
The physicians do not expect serious re
mits fn r~* the child's wounds. - Tl*Â« -*Â»r

CHANGE OF CLIMATE
Mot Necessary in Order to Cure
Catarrh..
The popular Idea that the only care for
chronic catarrh Is a change of climate is a
tainly return,
mistake, because catarrh is found in all
climates in all : actions of the country,
ar.d even if a change of climate should
benef.t for a time, the catarrh will cer-
Catarrh may be r^adilj cured in any cli-
mate, but the only way to do it is to (!e-
Ftroy or remove from the system the ca-
tarrhal gerzsa which cause all the mla-
chitt.
The trtatment by inhalers, sprays, pow-
ders end washee has been proven almost
tÂ«-iÂ«-sf In making a permanent cure as
they do rot reach the seat of disease,
which is in the blood end can be reached
only by an Internal remedy, which acts
through thÂ«Â» stomach upon tie blood and
eastern generally.
A new discovery which Is neetln* with
remarkable success in curing catarrh of
the head, throat and bronchial tube* and
also catarrh of the etomach is Â«old by
crag-gists under name ot Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets.
These tablet*, which are pleasant and
harmlesj to take, owe their efficiency to
the active medicinal principles of Blood
Root. Red Gum and a new specific called
Gualacol. which, together with valuable
antiseptics, are combined In convenient
palatable tablet form and as valuable for
children as for adults.
Mr. A. R. Fernbank of Columbus, Ohio
pa ye: I suffered so many winters frcm
Catarrh that I took it as a matter of
course and that nothing would cure it
â¢ xcept a thanre of climate, which my
lusir.esB affairs would not permit me to
lake.
My noFtrllB were almost always cloejred
up. I had to breathe througrh the mouth
â¢ eufcir.p an inflamed. Irritated throat. The
thought of eating breakfast often nause-
ate me. and the catarrh gradually gc-t-
ttr.c into my stomach took away my ap-
I ftlte anÂ«S d!gre*tlon.
My <irus^isr advised me to try a 53-cent
t ox of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because
h* thml ':Â¦<Â¦ had eo many customers who
had bÂ«r<rrs cured of Catarrh by the use of
th*-s* tab>ts that he felt he could honest-
ly recommend them. I took his advice
and used several boxes, with results that
surprised and delighted tr.e.
I always keep a box of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets in the house, and the whoie fam-
ily use th^m freeiy on the first appearance
of a cough or cold in the h^ad.
With our children we think there is
nothine; so cafe arid re liable as Stuart's
/Catarrh Tablets to ward off croup and
A colds; and with older people I have known
Jsi'i cases where the hearing had been se-
riouj.lv impaired Ly chronic catarrh cured
â¢ntireiy by this new remedy.

LIVERMORE, Jan. 19.â Great indigna
tion Is manifested among citizens of Liv
ermore because of the haste of Revenue
Officer William G. Hawkett in his seizure
of the late Wendell Jordan's brewery
while the family of the dead brewer was
prostrated and helpless from the terrible
j affliction. Friends of Jordan do not hesi
tate to declare that the official's act was,
under the circumstances, cold-blooded, to
say the least. Hawkett haa offered no
public explanation of his conduct.
It Is understood that the Federal offi
cials have released the brewery and that
arrangements have Deen made to contiue
the business which Jordan conducted for
twenty-six years undisturbed by officious
revenue Inspectors or any one else.
The townspeople testified their Bym
pathy and respect to-day by attending 1 tho
funeral of the dead brewer In large num
bers. From all portions of Livermore Val
ley came scores of Jordan's friends and
there was hardly standing room at Ma
sonic Hall, where the services were con
ducted. The funersJ was In charge of
Masonic Lodge No. 218, but many mem
bers of the Odd Fellows, Sons of Hermann
and American Lepion of Honor also paid
their fraternal tributes. The floral dis
play was or.e of the most beautiful ever
made In this valley.
Every place of business In the town was
eloped to-day. Services were conducted
by Rev. Arthur Hicks at the Jordan resi
dence. The Masonic ritual was observed
at the public exercises. The pall-bearers
were John Aylward, Professor Cornell.
I>r. Savage, Theodore Corner, Frederick
Mallcy and Benjamin Barker. The body
will be sent to San Francisco for crema
tion.
An inciuest was held to-day before Jus
tice J. H. Taylor, a verdict of accidental
death being rendered by the jury.

CLEMENT TO TALK
FROM THE PULPIT
A policeman named Lynch, whose beat
lies on Mission street, was another of Mc-
Allister's victims. Suit was actually com
menced acalnst him, but a nonsuit re
sulted. An ex-Supervisor is said to havo
also listened too confidingly to McAllis
ter, and only the bill collecting agency
knows how many others.
Moritz sees a whole lot of reasons whv
he should not pay it. He says he wishes
he had his life insured, as then he would
drown or otherwise remove himself and
send his wife to Europe on the proceeds.
Mr. H. F. W. Moritz, cityâ Dear Sir: In the
matter of the note of H. L.. McAllister. $5 87
and Interest, we beg: leave to advise you that
unless you call at our office and make some
satisfactory arrangements concerning the pay
ment of this obligation, either in weekly or
monthly Installments, we shall positively sue
you. We understand you are amply able to
pay your obligations and we see no reason why
you should not pay this.
Yesterday came a letter to Moritz from
a local bill collector. This is how it read:
His interest, however, in Moritz's con
tinuance in the mortal coil must .-have
languished with his departure, for though
it was for many days a vexed question
with Herr and Frau Moritz as to whether
or no the night cook of the Branch should
carry a price on his' head. McAllister
never came back to see what thev were
going to do about it.
A guileless appearing: insurance agent of
Ingratiating address put in an appearance
at the Branch Cafe on Fifth street some
time aeo. His name was McAllister, H.
I* McAllister, representing the New York
Mutual Life Insurance, Company, he said
to the young lady behind the cash regis
ter, who announced the fact to a waiter,
who told It to another waiter, who told
it to the dishwasher, who in an ill-starred
moment confided the fact to H. F. W.
Moritz, the nig-ht cook. Moritz, feeling
his occupation a hazardous one, had for
some time been hesitating on the brink
of a plunte into life Insurance and
thought he saw his chance to make a
dicker In the matter of taking out a pol
icy. McAllister proved accommodating,
but Moritz hesitated and finally, being a
wise man, decided to talk Â»it over with
his wife before doing anything rash. To
this McAllister was perfectly agreeable,
but in case he might forget Moritz In the
whirl of business cares he would ask the
favor of his autograph.
Moritz saw nothing Irregular in this,
and so Â¦wrote his name on a piece of paper
McAllister handed to him. Then McAllis
ter, all smiles and bows, departed, say
ing he would come back to hear whether
Moritz and his better half had arrived at
a decision.
Once more has the 'clever confidence op
erator found a harvest in this city. The
number of his victims is not known, but
they may be many. His method of shear-
Ing the sheep he had selected was like all

Rock Park may be dynamited in the hope

Park Commissioners are considering the
question. There i3.no money available
for boring purposes, and many believe dy

A number of sticks of dynamite will ba
sunk. in. the : well, attached to an electric
wire for exploding it, and the well filled
with water, to act as a resistance to the
upward force of the dynamite.
The gas evidently comes into the well
through a fissure in the ground, and an
explosion would undoubtedly open the
aperture and let in a bigger flow. An ex
plosion would raise the water in the well

the well will be made the. event of a gen

from Vernon, B. C, says: Lee English, 20
years old, shot Thomas Carson, his
brother-in-law, three times through the
body, killing him instantly and fatally
wounding William Carson, who was In
Thomas' company. The affair took place
on the street and was the outcome of the
charges of Ill-treatment of Mra. Carson,
English's sister, by her husband. Young
English bought a revolver several days
ago, saying- that he feared Carson would
kill him. It is said that Carson struck
English with a club before the shooting
began. The deceased had a club firmly
clasped in his hands -when picked up and
with this weapon he Is supposed to have
inflicted a wound which appears upon

BAN JOSE. Jan. 19.â There are an un
usually large Influx of robins this year,
and they are playing havoc with the olive
orchards. In the vicinity of El Quito olive
farm, In the southwestern foothills, there
are thousands of the birds, and -" men
armed with shotguns are employed to kill
them. E. E. Qoodrlch, the owner of the
place, estimates he has lost one-fourth of.
his crop, the financial loss being: "about
$6000. The Masson orchard of seven acres
adjoining, which a few weeks ago gave
promise of a large crop, has been entirely
stripped of its fruit. At the Goodrich
place a number of armed guards are
maintained to keep the birds on the flight,
and a general invitation has been extend
ed to the hunters of this city to join in
the sport. It 13 said nearly 3000 of tho
birds were killed there last Sunday.
The idea that has prevailed for years
that the robin was a benefit to the fruit
growers and the orchards is being rap
idly dlfpelled. The robiaÂ»ls a migratory
bird and appears in this valley at this
time of the year only, at which season
he does great harm to the olives. It ls
further declared that the birds are de-
Btroyin? the ladybirds ' and ladybugti
which were imported to war on fruit
peets.
The Grange and Farmers' Club recently
passed resolutions favoring the protection
of the robin, and this has aroused the .ire
of the olive-growers. An opposite view
was taken by the Fish and Game Protec
tive Association last night, and it appoint
ed a committee to wait upon the Farm
ers' Club and the grange and urge them
to rescind their action. Horticultural
Commissioner Ehrhorn also declares the
robin destructive and deprecates its pro
tection. Olive-growers declare that with
protection the robin in a few years would
become a serious pest.

Is hardly a ' dollar coming to Butte as
dividends from the Butte copper mines to
original holders of shares. This is claimed
to be "appalling" because not less than
$100,000,000 have been paid in dividends by
these mines during the last fifteen years.
The remedy proposed for the apathy
which has deprived Montana mining prop
erties of local support is a mining ex
change. There are but two or three stock
brokers In Butte. The accusation' ls made
by the Montana paper that "there ls not
sufficient Interest . taken in Butte among
those able to- carry out such a project to
organize a mining exchange. This is not
only the condition of affairs to-day, but
never in the history, of Butte. have they
been different. What a woeful condition
of affairs in the greatest mining camp on
earth, where the pay roll amounts to fully
$20,000,000 a 'year, ; - and its mines earn an
nually many "times that amount. On the
other hand, observe what Is' fast Â¦building
up a rival to Butte. In Cripple Creek
over M cents of every dollar produced dur
ing last" year from Its mines belong to
the people of the Immediate vicinity. The
lethargy existing In Butte among its mon
eyed men and influential citizens is appall
ing in this regard." .

a few flays Pneumonia follows.
The main trouble ls centered In the

are more ominous of evil In proportion to
the age of the patient. Past 50 years of
age Pneumonia is a very fatal malady;
The" man who gets thoroughly chilled
after exposure to Inclement weather must

outcome, especially if high temperature,

Monday morning upon the body of Flor
ence Bell, the young girl who killed her
eelf â¢with ' carbolic acid last Wednesday
because she discovered that her sweet
heart. Robert Blum, was a married man.
Mrs. Kate Sere, a sister of tho dead girl,
called at the ' Coroner's office yesterday
morning and left with Chief Deputy Mc-
Cormick an anonymous letter which John
Bell, her -brother, had received. It was
printed with pen and ink and misspelled.
The following is a corrected copy:
CITY, Jan.* 18. Â¦ 1901.
As I knew what your feeling must be about
your sister's death and as there is no way
to get even by the law, and as I have a bone
to pick with Blum myself, I shall, it this finds
you, do my best to help- you along. Here Is
my: Idea: He has a part of a saloon at Car
ters, a small city up toward the mountains.
Take train '. at Stockton.- I shall see by the
papers what you will do. I am pretty sure
that you will find him there, and I shall find
out later for sure if he is there, and see If you
want him very badly. You will surely find
him there.
It is believed by Bell's friends that the
letter is a decoy, sent to entice him into
the mountains, where he might be foully
dealt with.

Coroner Leland will h,old an inquest
formal note to the Venezuelan Govern
ment, and certainly nothing In the nature
of an ultimatum. The Secretary of State
Baid that Minister Loomis' instructions so
far have been telegraphic and have- direct
ed him to protest to the Venezuelan
authorities against any disturbance of
American rights and property. Further
than this the State Department has not
sent forward any definite instructions as
to the next step to be taken If the Min

tory compliance.

night that this Government has not
authorized Minister Loomis to present a
ACTION TJNATJTHOHIZED.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 19.â Officers
of the United States gunboat Scorpion
say that the situation is grave. Minister
Loomis in consequence of instructions
from Washington has made four protests
against the Government decree annulling
the concession of the New York and "Ber
mudez Asphalt Company. The protests
were based on the fact that Venezuela
acted without the approval of the Su
preme Court.
Minister Loomis has made an imperative
demand, practically an ultimatum, that
the Venezuelan Government would not
dispossess the New York and Bermudez
Company before the authorities in Wash
ington could investigate the case. It was
urged by Mr. Loomis that the New' Tork
and Bermudez Company should be per
mitted by Venezuela to remain in posses
sion of the asphalt property until the con
troversy has been settled In court. Vene
zuela has defied the United States and has
Riven apparently no consideration to the
demands from Washington.
Dispatches to-day from Guanaco indi
cate that troubles are imminent. Guer
rilla bands are threatening to destroy the
asphalt refining plant. The political band
which is harassing the New York and
Bermudez Company offers to restore the
asphalt properties and to give full protec
tion upon the payment of $400,000.
There is no trouble in Caracas and busi
ness conditions are excellent.

.again In .Washington at 10 o'clock Monday
morning. -" Â¦ - Â¦-. Â¦" " :
Cadets Bettison, Mahaffey, Gray and
Atkins, the presidents and representatives
of the four classes, were called before the
committee and addressed by General Dick,
who thanked them for their action in
abolishing hazing at the academy and
said that Congress would recognize and
adopt what they had done. -
He also thanked Colonel Mills â¢ for the
kindness and courtesy shown the commit
tee since it had come here. He also said
the committee would go back to Congress
with the kindest feelings and best wishes
for the academy and all connected with it.
This voluntary act of the corps has so Im
pressed the committee that it ha* every
reason to believe that in spirit and in letter
It will be carried out by those cadets who
are now" at the military academy. This action
of the men is greatly commended by the com
mittee and will be read by the country with
feelings of merited approbation.
WEST POINT, Jan. 19.â To the Superin
tendent of the United States Military Academy:
Having become cognizant of the manner in
which the system of hazing, as practiced at
the military academy, Is regarded by the peo
ple of the United States we, the cadets of
the United States Military Academy, while
maintaining that we have pursued our system
from the best motives, yet realizing that the
deliberate Judgment of the people should In
a countiy like ours be above other considera
tions, do reaffirm our former action abolish
ing the practice of exercising fourth class men
and do further agree to discontinue hazing and
compelling: fourth class men to eat anything
against their desire and the practice of "calling
out" fourth class men by claas action I and
that we will not devise similar practices to
replace those abandoned.'
After reading tho communication Gen
eral Dick said: Â¦â¢,:?, Â¦Â¦.-'^ â¢Â»â¢ Â¦ -;. ..;/ :.-. .^.j
As soon as Colonel Hein concluded his
testimony Colonel Mills, superintendent of
the academy, handed the following docu
ment, signed by the president of each of
the classes, to Colonel Dick, chairman of
the committee:
Lieutenant Colonel Otto Hein, com
mandant of cadets, was the next witness.
General Dick told him that the commit
tee had decided to adopt his testimony as
reported in the records of the military
court of inquiry and that he could amplify
it in any way he desired. The witness
said he was surprised at the number of
fights which had occurred in the last
three years, according to evidence ad
duced at the sessions of the committee.
It was a revelation to him and he added
that the cadets evaded all the watchful
ness of the tactful officers which vigor
ously tried to discover such breaches of
the rules and regulations.
General Dick asked Burnet If he had
anything further to add to his testimony
and the witness replied:
I would like to say that Congress and the
people do not understand West Point.
In response to your own suggestion that
Congress and the people do not seem to under
stand West Point, said General Dick, let me
gar to ycu that cadets at West Point seem,
until recently, to have failed to understand the
people. Congress, not wishing to be hasty in
the matter, sent this committee here to in
quire as to the exact condition of things and
to inquire into all these many charges that
were laid at the door of West Point. This
committee has been diligent in Its Inquiry now
for close- on to three weeks. We have had to
make this Investigation a searching one, with
out fear or favor, and certainly without preju
dice against, the institution. We are all proud
of it, and the American people have a great
Interest in It. One hundred years Have testi
fied to Its worth and to its value to the coun
try- It has produced great men and it will
continue to do so unless Its purpose in per
verted. It seldom comes to any set of men
to have such an opportunity as that which
presents itself at Â¦ this time to the cadets at
West Point to render this institution and the
country so great a service by resolving now
and here that no charges as serious as these
shall, if they can help It, ever be laid at West
Point's doors again.
Yes, sir. I believe that Is so.
Will you tell tie If yoa desired to help a
fourth claaa man. why it would not be better
to ebollsh all social distinction * between the.
classes and by thus associating- with the fourth
class impress on its members the sense of
honor and the moral principles which actuate
the corps?
As army officers can teach their men, main
taining this distinction between them, so the
upper classes can better Instruct the fourth
class by maintaining the first class distinc
tion.
Did the Savior believe that he could better
impress hln moral code upon the people by
associating with publicans and sinners than
ho could by keeping himself at a distance from
them?

that Cadet Prentice, upon whose word he
(the witness) had relied when he wrote
of the alleged incident to Rev. Mr. Allison,
had edmltted on the witness stand that
he was mistaken.
Judge Smith, during his examination of
Burnet, said:
him a patent oil burner for $250. which
was found to be valueless. Mitchell ap
plied to Judge Lawlor to be released on
bonds, but the Judjte decided that he could
not Interfere, and Mitchell was locked up
In the City . Prison. Constable Douglass
will take him to Visalia to-day.
From Naples Mr. Aden goes to his old
home in Germany and will then return
to San Francisco by way of New York.
Mr.- Aden will be away several months.
More than a hundred of his friends were
down to see him off.
During his Journeyings Mr. Aden will

said Dr. Allison had scored the cadets
without being in possession of the full
facts of Booz's life at the academy. The
witness stated that Booz had told official
and private falsehoods. One falsehood
was the filing of an incorrect statement in
answer to a report charging him with not
observing the rules at a change of sentry
posts. The witness considered Booz's ac
tions in his fight with Keller as discred
itable to him. He held that Booz should
have stayed in the fight until he was
knocked senseless. The witness also ex
pressed the opinion that it was discredit
able in Booz to read a novel held inside
the covers of a Bible. The witness was
surprised when Chairman Dick told him
WEST POINT, N. Y., Jan. 19.â The Con
gressional investigation of the West
Point Military Academy has borne fruit
rather unexpectedly. To-night when the
Congressmen were hurrying their in
quiries to a termination the cadets of all
four classes held a meeting in Grant Hall
and unanimously decided to abolish hai
ing of every form, as well as the practice
of "calling out" fourth class men. This
Is exactly what General Dick and the
other members of the Congressional com
mittee have beerOtrying to Impress upon
the cadets who have testified before
them as the only course open to them if
they desired to see the fair name of the
United States Military Academy unsullied
and above reproach. The communication
was addressed to Superintendent A. L..
Mills, who returned from Washington
only this afternoon, and he quickly
brought it to General Dick. The commit
teemen are delighted at the action of the
cadet?, and General Dick In a few words
said they would all go back to the House
of Representatives hoping that in spirit
and letter the agreement would be kept
by the cadets who made it voluntarily.
The first witness examined this morn
ing was Cadet Paul D. Bunker of Massa
chusetts, who is a member of the present
third class. Last night some of the plebes
told the committee that Bunker had
braced them and given them tobasco
sauce during: the encampment last sum
mer. Cadet Dillon said he was compelled
by Bunker to swallow from a half to a
teaspoonful of the sauce, given him in a
camp spoon, which la about the size of a
dessert spoon.
Bunker acknowledged having braced
some of the plebes, but denied ever hav
ing given more than fifteen drops of sauce
to any one, and when Judge Smith con
fronted him with Dillon's testimony the
witness said he did not recollect ever hav
ing given such a large quantity to Dillon
or to any other plebe. . , â.
Bunker, who said he weighs about 200
pounds and measures five feet eleven and
a quarter inches, only remembered having
hazed two men who .were his equal m
nhvsique. The other plebes whom he hazed
were small men. He had never engaged
in fights, either as principal or assistant.
His hazing repertoire was rather limited,
as he had confined himself to bracing,
making men sing out their wash lists to
popular airs, ride broomsticks, stand on
their heads and charge sparrows witn
fixed bayonets. . .
radet Charles Burnet. appointed from
Illinois, president of the Cadet Branch of
the Young Men's Christian Association,
at Chairman Dick's request, read the cor
respondence, heretofore published, be
tween himself and Dr. Allfson of Bristol,
Pa. When the witness concluded Gen
eral Dick handed to him and asked him
to read several letters written by Booz
to members of his family during the time
he was attending the academy. In them
Booz said that the other cadets were
tyrants, brutes and bullies and said they
were doing their best to kill him. He
told of his fight, in a letter written the
day after it occurred, and said that he
had to give up after being winded. He
asked permission to resign, saying there
was no honor in his staying at West Point
any longer and that the Military Academy
was no place for parents to send a boy.
Then the chairman requested the wit
neeg to read from the military regula
tions the sections which prohibit fighting,
hazing, etc., and the oath which a cadet
takes on entering the academy. When
this reading was finished. Chairman Dick,
saying to the witness that he had been
mentioned to the committee as one of the
principal hazers in the academy, handed
him a list of the corps of cadets with
the request that he point out the names
of those who are noted for their hazing
proclivities. The witness replied that,
having in mind the time when hazing was
in vogue, he might have to name every
one in the upper classes. I>urlngthe past
year, however, ail vigorous" forms of haz
ing have become obsolete.
Referring to Rev. Dr. Allison's letter,
Chairman Dick asked the witness if he
knew of the word "Bible" having been
used sarcastically In reference to former
Cadet Booz.
"No, sir," replied the witness. "I
never heard him called 'Bibles' and if he
was It would have been done thoughtless
lv by some cadet."
"If any cadet were subjected to ridicule
or any "inconvenience on account of his
religion, could he escape or avoid it?"
"It would come to the ears of the heads
of the Y. M. C. A. sooner or later and the
president of his class would be notified.
This would result in the president taking
measures to stop any further molesta
tions." â¢
The witness was then taken to task for
statements in his letter to Dr. Allison. He

Not for the monthly troubles alone
are Mrs. Pinkham's medicines and ad-
vice r,f so much value, nor is it only
those that made women old before their
time. All those female disorders that
r.re so prevalent among our sex add
Just po much to our age, and should be
cured. The dragging-down pains from
which women puffer so much, head-
aches, backaches, and the various un-
natural discharges, are all direct causes
of the old ape that creeps upon women
only too quickly. These things can all
be cured by the use of Mrs. Pinkham's
medicine, and I hope every reader of
this paper who suffers in this way will
take my advice and secure for herself
that youth that is the greatest charm
of women. HELEN MARVIN.
There is no one living who knows
more about these matters than Mrs.
Pinkham. and I would like every
Tinman who wishes to retain her youth-
ful beauty to write to her. Mrs. Pink-
ham will know just what is best to
do. Her m*Â»dicinp has taken the care-
worn look from many a woman's face,
end has relieved the sufferer from pains
that made her look ten j-ears older
than slip was.
When the monthly illness arrives,
there should be no pain. This to most
women, who are used to considering
these pains as their inheritance from
Mother Eve, will come as a surprise.
But it is certain that this event should
come upon us as easily as the dawn
ifid just as regularly, if women would
find in it a mear.s of beauty. When it
does not so arrive. It is a sign of trou-
ble, and should be attended to at once.
It Is absolutely necessary that a -wo-
man should be regular, if she would be
>outhful. Having three weeks elapse
at one time, and six at another. Is
bound to result in mischief, and the
woman who lets this condition con-
tinue is sure to grow old before her
time. Flooding- is equally dang-erous *o
the youthful appearance of women, and
El.ould be stopped.
Hut most important of all in a wo-
man's efforts to keep young must be
considered her monthly illness. This is
Nature's definite provision for secur-
ing to our sex perpetual youth. Tet,
unless the various organs of our sex
v.ork naturally, without pain or hind-
rance of any kind, the desired result
will not be accomplished, and a woman
will crow old rather than young.
Never worry. Worry never improved
matters, and if you stop to think a
minute, you can almost always count
up more blessings than troubles. Be-
sides, worn.- usually unfits a woman for
prond. rational thinking, and therefore
nften hinders instead of helps. Many
\von:<=n find themselves unable to stop
worrying; This is directly traceable to
nervousness, and is an illness that
Fhould be cured. It causes a woman to
grow old, and thin, and irritable. If
you worry and cannot stop it. take Ly-
dia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
That wjll make your nerves strong, and
you \\i!l find yourself growing 1 young
un<ier the treatment.
Esthe immediately upon rising in the
morning, and take a hard rubdown aft-
erward. This won't take more than
five or ten minutes. Then put on a
Ic.nse pown through which the air can
pass freely, and work around in that
for an hour or two. This air bath will
take years from a woman's face.
Kxercise every day in the open air.
Take a Fhort, brisk walk. If you can-
not find time, let one room go unswept,
or prepare a more simple meal. A
charming, rosy woman is always more
pleasing to a man when he reaches
home than the most immaculate house
or th<Â» most elaborate of dinners.
In the first place, a woman should
rever overwork herself. True, many of
us have too much to do. But when you
find your strength privini? out. sit down.
If you are very tired, lie down, with
the hips hijrher than the shoulders, for
jvihaps five minutes. Don't fuss over
your work. No matter how much you
have to do, do it quietly. The great-
est amount of fussinj? never got the
work dime more quickly, and it cer-
tainly has Riven Time an opportunity
to put his hand upon many a woman's
fare.
Not at all. Men may grow old, if
they wish. "With them it Is strength
and wisdom rather than youth that Is
attractive. For women Xature has
made definite provision, that they may
keep youthful.
Tet, I hear a number of women ex-
claim, how cam I keep from growing
o!d? Isn't It the fate of all that we
should prow old?
Our sex should follow the example
set by Holmes, vrho spoke of himself
as being so many years young, not old.
A -woman rhould never grow old, need
never grow old. Experience may put
lines of wisdom upon her face, but they
will enhance its beauty. The wither-
ing hand of ape, which would disfigure
these lines and take glow of youth from
the flesh, should never appear.

The Letter Carriers' Mutual Aid Asso

niversary entertainment and ball Satur
day evening, January 26, In Native Sons'
Hall. As all the entertainments of this
society In previous years have been most
successful and enjoyable, a delightful
time Is anticipated. The committees on
arrangements have already beeen appoint
ed and are diligently at work. The pro
gramme ls as follows:
missing. When the directors appointed
the expert to look over Walden's
books and accounts I gave them
the keys to the safe In which
all the prison records are kept. I fur
ther told them that if at any- time there
was anything needed to assist them In
their Investigation to call on me and I
would give them every help In my power.
At present they are the custodians of the
books of the prison. They have not as
yet called upon m^ to fuijiish anything
that is not within their reach."
"How far back have they cone in their
investigation and examination of Wai
den's accounts?"
Working on Books of 1897.
"I do not know," replied Ajrulrre, "but
In passing through the office to-day I no
ticed that they were working on, or, at
least, had before them, the books of 1897."
"Had the experts discovered anything
wrong In the accounts would they have
made a report to you?"
EPISCOPALIANS OF THE DIOCESE OF CALIFORNIA
TO MEET HERE IN ANNUAL CONVENTION TUESDAY
THE San Quentin Jute mill I
scandal as It progresses I
daily, assumes more gigantic
proportions. There seems to
fce tut little doubt that the
beginning of Walden's pecu
lations dates back to a pe
riod lopjr before the time he
Prst occupied the position of a free man at
tXM penitentiary* There are rumors that j
-Â¦< em to point tSthe fact that there was j
a systematic scheme of robbery of the
State, and that the missing clerk had
ronfederates both Inside and outside the
walls of the jaiL There is a persistent
assertion on the part of those interested
that they have no knowledge of any
nTonpdo:r.g on the part of Walden, other
than that of the Levy transaction.
It Is rumored on apparently good au- !
thnrity that the investigation now in j
fi-oerress will result in showing- but a small ;
portion of the crooked work. It is said ,
mat certain books that should now be in i
the office of the warden are missing. Â¦
Whether they disappeared prior to the j
abrupt departure of Walden or afterward j
Ls a matter of conjecture. Warden Aguirre j
K.ivs that if any books or accounts are !
missing he knows nothing of the matter. '
He even goes so far as to deny- that he J
has ever beard of anything being missing
from the records of his office.
"It is Just tills way," said he yesterday. )
I know nothing concerning the admlnis- i
I ation of the affairs of the prison prior j
9 rr.y coming- here as warden in July. 1S39.
I accepted In faith with the duties of
>ffice"the books, records and property
Luraed over to me by my predecessor."
â¢ on at that time have an inventory j
Â¦f the sacks in the prison ware*- I
house?" was ask<vl of the Warden
"I did," he repltea.
Discrepancy of One Eale.
"W ss thr-T'- any discrepancy between j
the numebr of sacks on hand and the ,
number that there should have been in
the warehouse, according to the figures in
the stockbook?"
"There was one bale missing."
"Was the missing bale ever found?"
"No."
"How, then, was It that the expert ac
countant of the board was able to render
periodically a true balance sheet? â¢ Must
there not have been a discrepancy that
should have at that time been followed
up and investigated?"
"I made inquiries about the matter and
learned that the missing bale had disap
peared years ago. It had been carried
over on the books from one administra
tion-to another, and I accepted it as part
of the emoluments of the office. You
must understand that the Warden Is in
a great measure dependent on the reports
of the experts appointed by the Prison
Commissioners. They are supposed to un
derstand their business. After they look
over the books and accounts of the prison
it Js not part of the duty of the Warden to
check these up and see that the report
made Is correct. The Commissioners re
ceive the reports of the expert, pass upon
them and then the Warden can no longer
be held responsible for anything that may
have goqe wrong in the financial manage
ment of the prison. I am under $120,000
bonds, and if for one moment I suspected
that any of the employes under me were
pruilty of wrongdoing I would Immedi
ately suspend them or discharge them in
ordfr to protect the sureties on my bond."
"Is It not a fact. Warden, that you either
know personally or have been informed
that certain books and records are miss
inp from your office?"
"No."
"Have you not heard a rumor to the
effect that certain books belonging to the
office have been either stolen or de
stroyed?"
"No," replied the Warden, "I have no
knowledge of any books or records being

"No, I cannot;" said MacLaren. "I am
working for the Directors. If you want
any information go to them. This is a
caso of bread and butter to me. I am not
talking to any reporters. If it was my
own brother I would not tell him any
thing./ You may be rightly Informed as
to the 15,000 sacks proposition, but you
cannot verify It by me."
"Are any books or records missing from
the office ?" was asked. \ .

sold to Levy 15,000 sacks, which he
claimed were the property of a man
named Browning, who had authorized him
to sell them?"
ing prison affairs had not the books and
records been before him.
"There is nothing to be told by me," said
he, "for I am in the employ of the di
rectors. Any information to be given out
will come from them."
Expert McLaren, when seen a few min
utes later, looked wise and undoubtedly
would have denied that he was investigat-
"No," answered Aguirre. "When they
have finished their examination they will
report to the directors. If the directors
then see fit to make known the result of
the investigation the public will, through
the columns of the newspapers, know the
condition of affairs. The report. If given
out, will be read at a public meeting. As
I told you before, I know nothing of the
prison records other than since the time
I assumed the duties of Warden. There
might be some books or records missing,
because I never had an inventory made of
the records in the ofllce. I have surren
dered to the experts the keys of the safe
in which the books are kept. They have
not informed me that anything Is missing
nor called my attention to any discrepan
cies. You might see Expert MacLaren.
If anything wrong has been discovered
outside of what you aaeady know he will
be able to tell you."
ASSOCIATION OF PROMINENT DOCTORS IS FORMED

bought from Warden Hale 50.000 sacks at
the then market price of 4% cents, the
total being 12230. For this merchandise
he gave a check payable to Warden Hale.
On the same day Levy drew a check for
$660 in favor of C. J. Walden and bought
15,000 sacks at 13 cents a hundred less than
he was paying Hale. The latter sale was
made, the cash paid and the deal closed
apparently before even Levy received the
sacks. The receipted bill for the 15,000
sacks Is dated October 15â a. day after the
check was drawn.
Levy, as usual, was profuse yesterday
In excuses to the police as to how he came
to buy the 15.000 sacks far below the mar
ket price. The Junk dealer claims that
Walden told him the same old story â "that
a J. R. Browning was overstocked with
sacks and that he could dispose of them
at a low figure."
"Where Walden has gone- to is a mystery.
The general belief is that he is hidden
somewhere in or near the city and that
he has been Joined in his seclusion by his
wife and his two children. A friend of
his stated yesterday that he was sure the
man was not far away and that he was
in constant communication with friends
in the city.
Walden's wife's maiden name was Lun
berg. and she has several brothers and
sisters in this city. Arthur L. Lunbers
of the firm of Lunberg & Lee. Jewelers at
232 Post street, is a brother-in-law of the
absconder. When asked where Mrs. Wal
den was he stated that she was "across
the bay."
Prison Director Wilklns was In the city
yesterday working hard on the Walden
case. He had no news to furnish. He is
very much annoyed at a purported Inter
view that recently appeared in a morning 1
paper. WHkins emphatically states that
he was misquoted from beginning to end
in the article and that he and Warden
Agulrre have had no misunderstanding,
and that he never spoke of the "Warden
or his administration in the manner al
leged in the article.
The facts brought out by Captain Sey
mour are these: On October 14, 1893, Levy
The story that was published In The Call
recently stating that Levy had purchased
15,003 sacks from Walden in October of
1898 was proven absolutely true yesterday.
Levy was Interviewed at his residence the
night before and declared that he had
bought sacks from Walden but twice, both
these purchases being In the fail of last
year. Yesterday he was ordered to ap
pear before Captain Seymour and explain
about the sale of 15,000 sacks in the month
of October, 1898.
Joseph Levy, the junk dealer of Clay
street, is getting deeper and deeper into
the scandal. In the eyes of the police
and the prison directors he is a guilty
man. He is believed by them to be a
confederate of Walden who secured all
the stolen plunder that he could lay his
hands upon.
Levy Held Guilty by Police.
Notwithstanding the reticence of those
who should be acquainted with the
inside history of the scandal caused by
the disappearance of Walden, it is gen
erally known that it Is but the matter of
a few days until the proof will be forth
coming that there has been a systematic
robbing of the prison. "While it is true
that some of the people who are by Dame
Rumor connected with the peculations of
Walden are dead, there is an Intent upon
the part of those who ; are forcing the
present investigation to probe to the bot
tom of the matter. When the truth is
known it will be a surprise to many peo
ple to learn that within the clique weie
citizens whose honesty has never been
doubted by them.
"You have not heard as yet that I have
asked the Warden for any books, have
you?" counter-queried j MacLaren as he
grabbed up his hat and ran out of the of
fice to catch the late train to San Fran
cisco.

Tanforan racecourse never presented a

yesterday afternoon, the occasion being
the regular meet of the San Mateo

advantage than at any other time in

all who had the. good fortune to be pres

The course lay over the undulating land
between Tanforan and the ocean. The
fences were taken as found, no attempt
being made to lower the top rail. The
run occupied nearly three hours, Includ

and men recovered quickly from their ex

There was a noticeable Improvement In
the hunting etiquette of the field bver that
shown at thÂ»Â» meet held at Ingleslde last
year. This may have been caused by the
absence of ladies, both at the meet and In
uie field, and the consequent lack of op
portunity to play to thÂ« gallery. Certain
it, is there was no riding down of hounds,
as on former occasions, and the hunt ser
vants. Jerry Keating, the huntsman, and
Richards, the whlpper-ln, were not Inter
fered with in the performance of their
duties.
Â»The only smart turnout at the meet was
the pony four-in-hand tooled by the mas
ter of the hunt. Richard Graham, the In
imitable ringmaster at all the fashionable

SAN DIEGO TAKES FALL
OUT OF TOP NOTCHEES
Some Exciting Baseball Played by
Teams in the Southern
League.
SAN* DIEGO, Jan. 19.â The San Diego
baseball team took a fall out of the lead
ers to-day in the race for the Southern
League pennant by a score of 7 t,o 2. The
locals presented a lineup and battery
order which was strong in every par
ticular. All of the players are known in
San Francisco except Works and Klauber
who are local men.
Taylor, who has been signed by Cal
K wing to play with' Oakland next sum
mer/ was in the box foe San Diego, and
though ho was touched up for bIx hits
l.o seemed to have, the visitors at his
mercy all of the time. When strike-outs
were needed. they were forthcoming. Most
of the time that the ball waa met it was
for a fly ball or an infield 'hit. which
meant an out each time.
The particular feature of the game' was
the poor playing of King, who had the
sulks or the grip or some other malady.
He had five chances and missed two of
them. To-morrow Charley Doyle will de
liver the goods for San Diego and Bell
vllle will pitch for San Bernardino. The

OAKLAND GOLFERS WIN.
In the flrst half of the home-and-home
tournament between teams of six men
and holed out. making the hole In 2, or
one less than bogey. The other incident
befell J. ,V\\ Byrne and F. 8. Stratton,
who -were all square at the sevpnteenth
hole. Stratton, one stroke to the good,
putted for the eighteenth hole, his ball
coming to rest an inch short of the cup.
Then Byrne putted, earroming -oft Strat
ton's ball into the hole. Stratton's ball,
however, fell over into the cup, thus giv
ing the Oaklander the hole and the match.
The San Francisco team was weakened
by the absence of John Lawson, H. B.
Goodwin and II. C. Golcher. E. J. Mc-
Cutchen also found himself unable to
play, and R. G. Brown played in his stead.
Next Saturday the Oakland team will
visit the Presidio links, where the city
players will probably be ready with a
stronger team. The full details are given
in the table:

Point Adams links a series of interesting
matches terminated in favor of the OaJc

resentatives only two scored against
their opponents, B. D. Adamson beatinK
K. R. Folger 5 up and R. Gilman Brown
defeating- T. Jl. Hutchinson 2 up. The
pain of Adamson was offset by W. P.
Johnson of the Oakland team, who scored
6 up against S. L. Abbot Jr. R. G.
Brown's pain of 2 up was counterbal
anced by F. S. Stratton, who scored 1 up
against J. "\V. Byrne, and C. P. Hubbard,
who beat L. O. Kellopg: 1 up. R. M. Fitz
perald's good pcore of 4 up against H. D.
Plllsbury thus became the turning-point
of the contest. After the first two couples
had handed in their scores neither team
had scored any advantage. When the.
third pair came In Oakland was 1 up, and
at the conclusion of the fourth match In
creased Its lead to 5 up. C. P. Hubbard
raised the total Jn favor of Oakland to 6
up, but R. G. Brown reduced it to 4 up.
The course was in excellent condition

WITH the Lissak handicap
down for decision and the
possibilities of witnessing a
battle royal between the
crack three-year-olds Rolling
Boer and Articulate in another event a
very large crowd viewed the racing at
Oakland yesterday. The handicap fur
nished a splendid contest,' resulting in a
victory for Charley Ellison's Specific, rid
den by- Domlnlck, but Articulate reward
ed the hopes of his iollowers by finishing
last of a field of five.
The track was not fast and favorites
displayed very poor form, bat two purae.3
going to short-priced horses. Grand Sa
chem, the Montana wizard, ran away
from his field in the San Leandro selling
handicap at odds of 15 to 1 and honest,
plodding Bill Garrett made all fifteen
thousand dollar horses look alike in th-s
Articulate-Rolling: Boer race.
In the speculating on the Lissak handi
cap, which was worth $1200 to the winner,
Sam Hildreth's pair. Vuieain. with 112 up,
and Golden Age carrying 107, ruled pro
nounced favorites, coupled. The Lady,
with Marty Bergen in the saddle, had
many friends and the game little mare
played in the toughest sort of racing luck.
A nice start was made by Mr. CaldweU
after a slight delay, Golden Age being
first away. According to instructions
Dominick. on Specific, made a play for
the lead, but found a stubborn contender
in Vulcain, ridden by Bullman. In fact,
ft was a two-horse race for the last six
furlongs, with Specific outgamlng Vul
cain finally and winning by a nose. The
J^ady had many har<i knocks from the
head of the stretch in, but landed her 113
pounds In the &how, a head before Preju
dice. The wlnninr was as good as 6 to
1 in the betting and Dominick is entitled
to much praise for his splendid handling
of tho Ellison entry.
Not until the last event on the pro
gramme did Articulate and Rolling Boer
meet. The distance was seven furlongs
and the brown colt was asked to concede
ten pounds to the Boer and larger chunkj
to Bill Garrett, Grafter and Ordnung. in
the betting it was 2 to 1, and your pick
hetween the Boer; and Articulate, while
as good as 3 could be had about Bill Gar
rett. By many it was predicted that Ar
ticulate would fall and he did. Dominick.
on Bill Garrett, failed away in the lead
with his 98 pounds and though Coburn,
with Itolling Boer, always had a lottery
chance. Garrett won quite easily in 1:26> + .
Grafter finished third, behind Rolling
Boer, then followed Cvdnung and Articu
late.
According to the "dope" and all other
signs, 'Grand Sachem most assuredly Hke3
a light Impost. In the selling handicap
Rertfern had the leg up on the gelding
and won from start to finish. Lena was
dangerously close at the wire, losing by
half a length only, with the 6 to 5 choice.
Opponent, at her heels.
Dorene, the fast two-year-old filly by
Torso, from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable, captured the opening kindergarten
number. Buchanan beat the other riders
away and In a furious drive, got the ver
dict from Sol Lichtenstein, the favorite,
by half a length. Dr. Scharff showed an
amazing turn of speed as usual, taking
the show.
Friday's race seemed to have done Dan
Honlp's mare Theory a world of good, for
she cleverly outfooted the other starters
in the six-furlong sprint which followed.
Closing a Flight favorite over Goal
Runner, Theory took the lead from Dever
eaux at will, beating Socialist at the wire
by two lengths in 1:13'Â£. Tiburon finished
ahead of Goal Runner for third place.
Unquestionably In better condition than
the balance of the starters in the mile
selling affair. Donator, with Mnunce up,
scored a' very clean-cut V'in. The brown
gelding was backed from 4 to 2. and a"fter
waiting on Campus and Pat Morrlssey
to the stretch, Mounce made ,his move
and with several points to spare led
Torsida out a length at the wire. Campus,
notwithstanding that he showed signs of
soreness, ran a fair third.
5AN MATEO COUNTY HUNT ATTRACTS
A BRILLIANT FIELD OF HORSEMEN
... -
Articulate Upsets Calculations by Finishing
Last, Bill Garrett Winning Easily,
"Kid" McCoy will not be allowed to"
fight in San Francisco, at least during- the
regime of the present Board of Super
visors. The Supervisors' Tollce Commit
tee decided yesterday not to revoke the
permit heretofore granted; to the newly
organized Twentieth Century Athletic
Club, but only on condition that the club
will withdraw McCoy as one of the prin
cipals in the proposed contest with Shar
key to be given under Its auspices next
month. The managers of the club were
cited to appear and show cause why their
license for a light in February should not
be revoked.
In stating the objection of the commit
tee against McCoy being brought to this
city to box, Chairman Tobin said the com
mittee did not wish to discourage legiti
mate boxing, but objected seriously to al
lowing pugilists of McCoy's' reputation to
fight in San Francisco.
"Personally," said Tobin, "I am opposed
to all boxing contests in the manner they
imve recently been conducted, and unless
they are squarely held I would abolish
them altogether."
Herbert Choynskl, attorney for the club,
represented that McCoy Is a clever boxer
and that there was no evidence before the
committee that McCoy is a "faker," ex
cept the unsupported testimony of his
wife and that of Corbett's better half.
John Gleason. president of the club, quot
ed a well known sporting authority to
prove that McCoy had acted squarely in
his contest with qorbett.
"We will promise that not the slightest
suspicion will attach to the McCoy-Shar
key contest," said Mr. -Gleason. "If any
develops we will donate the purse to some
charity. The contest will be a skillful ex
hibition by two clever boxers." . â¢ -
"We gave you your permit." said Super
visor Reed, "with the understanding that
we would tolerate no "fake" contests un
der your management. We do not con
sider McCoy a proper person to bo signed
by an up-to-date athletic club/ and we re
fuse to be a party to bringing him out."
Supervisor Stafford agreed with his as
sociates in their stand. The committee
finally agTeed to allow a license to be Is
sued by the Tax Collector only after
Gleason had given the positive assurance
of the club directors that they will cease
negotiations with McCoy and at no time
permit him to engage In any contest un
der their auspices.

Final Chapters.
And last of allâ and bloodiestâ the Boer
â¢war. The English commander-In-chlef
has proclaimed that It was over, but the
daily skirmishes und the growing addi
tions to the list of more than 20,000 British
d*^a.d on the South African veldt speak
otherwise.
Each and all of these conflicts neces
sarily caused the British Queen the keen
est anxiety, and as she resects upon them
and upon the condition of Europe, always
on the verge of a general war, she must
have remembered that many of the mon
archs who were responsible for a good
deal of this dreadful bloodshed have long
since rendered their account to the King
of Kings, and that, in the presence of that
grim leveler. I>ea.th, they were no more
than the least of their subjects.
Since Victoria ascended the throne three

The next day the meeting of her first

Tne Coronation.
Queen Victoria was crowned with great
pomp at Westminster Abbey on June 28.
3-^S. Twenty months hiter fhe was mar
ried to hrr c<n:?!n. Prince Albort of Saxe-
Comirg-Gotha. ;
It was wholly a love match. She had
loved him for years before he had the
felicity cf leading- her to the altar. He
reciprocated her affection with equal ar
dor, but he could not prepese to her. TF12
gulf between their positions could not be
bridged by him. He was but an obscure
end ponni'.^ss German princeling, and
there were royal and wealthy suitors for
her hand without number. There was no
alternative; the Queen herself got over
the difficulty and proposed to Albert. She
<]Jd it In the graceful and modest manner
that was only to be expected of such a
maiden.
It was at r state ball. The young
couple had wandered from the throng of
dancers to a more secluded spot, when
Victoria, taking a rose from a little bou
quet that nestled on her breast, coyly
handed it to her partner. The young
Prince ecstatically cut open his tunic and
placed the flower next his heart. On the
following day it was known that they
were engaged.
After the ball she wrote to the Prince's
friend and mentor. Baron Stockmar:
"Albert has completely won my heart,
and all was settled between us this morn
ing. I feel certain he will make me happy.
I wish I could feel as certain of making
Mm happy." -
Victoria did everything in her power to
promote the well-being of her own peo
ple. She never ceased to keep herself
thoroughly posted on the social,
economical and political conditions of the
other nations of the world and more than
once her great influence and power was
exerted to maintain peace. During our
own Civil War she prevented her Gov
ernment from interfering in favor of the
South, and In 1S73, as has recently been
shown by the exposure of German state
secrets, she protested with the greatest
energy to Emperor William I against
Bismarck's scheme for the final conquest
and division of France. Tho "Man of
Blood and Iron" never forgave her for
thwarting his plans.
If any further proof Is needed that she
was always thoroughly conversant with
what was being done at the Foreign Of
fice. It is to be found In the manner in
which. In IS30. she put the brake upon
Lord Palmerston, then Foreign Secretary.
Palmerson had been taking things too
much into his own hands ar.d practically
lgrored the Premier, Lord John Russell.
The Queen had warned him. but he kept
on his Â¦way, and then she â¢"ut her foot
down.
Puts Her Foot Down.
On August 15. 1830, she wrote the fol
lowing:
"The Queen thinks It Is right. In order
to prevent any mistake for the future, to
explain what It Is she expects from tha
Foreign Secretary.
"She requires, first, that he will dis

Tlie Victorian Era.
Then the Victorian era Is associated
with names that are household words
wherever EnKl'sh is spoken, that have
maintained the superiority of our litera
ture, that we ela!m equally with the
English people and they with us; for
these masters of noble therught and
pathos and humor to whom" we owe so
much, who have so often lifted us above
the trials and worries and struggles of
our feverish existence, who appeal to our
better nature and inspire us with lofty
ideals, arc the appurtenance of our com
mon race, of our common tongue.
Be they llvinq: or be they dead, they are
friends we have always with us, who have
never failed us and never will. How fa
miliar their names sound as we run over
those that occur to us. English and Amer
ican, haphazard, pelJmell, just as they
surge Into our mind â Dickens, Thackeray,
Longfellow. Tennyson, Nathaniel Haw
thorne, Thomas Moore, Wordsworth (al
though the two latter perhaps properly
belong to George IV's reign, their best
Â¦work having been accomplished before
Victoria's time), Washington Irving. The
odore Hook, Lever, George Eliot, Bulwer
(Lord Lytton). Swinburne, Emerson, Bry
ant. Whlttier. Thomas Carlyle. Browning.
Captain Marryat. Southey. Channlng,
James Russell Lowell. Macaulay. George
Meredith. Hood. Alnsworth, Oliver Wen
dell Holmes, Reade et a!.â a' brilliant list,
of which any race might and would be
proud.
The civil war between Spain and Portu
gal was In progress when Victoria ascend
ed the throne. This was succeeded by the
opium war between England and China;
the disaster (followed by war)* in Afghan
istan, when out of 16,000 men, women and
children who set out In midwinter from
Cabul only one survivor reached Jellaha
bad in safety, all the others having suc
cumbed either to the hardships of the ter
rible journey or the bullets of the treach
erous Afghans; the French conquest of
Algeria: the revolutionary outburst in IMS
that shook the monarchical system of Eu
rope to Its foundations: Napolean Ill's
coup d'etat; the Crimean war; the terri
ble Indian mutiny; the Anglo-French war
with China; the war between France and
Austria; the great American civil strife;
the wars between Prussia and Austria;
France and Mexico, Brazil and Paraguay,
France and Germany, Russia and Turkey.
Chile and Peru, France and China and
China and Japan, not to speak of the re
bellion In Canada and other minor cam
paigns in Asia and Africa, all more or less
savage and sanguinary, but too numerous
to mention.
the bluest of blue blood; not even to the
changing of a button on the uniform of
the Prince of Wales, her son, and heir to
her throne. Her experience of Orientals
and their ceremonious customs paved her
from Â»ven making the slightest lapsus in
her dealings with them.
During Li Hung Chang's tour through
Europe he was received with courteous
empressement by the other rulers whose
courts he vts'ted. Each and all made the
gross mistake o* shaking hands with him
â¢and treating him almost as an equal.
When the Viceroy was ushered Into Vic
toria's presence chamber she remained
seated, wrapped In the imperial dignity
that has awed mightier men than he. The
intelligent Celestial grasped his position
at once. He groveled to the British Em
press-Queen as he would have groveled
to his maBter, or the Dowager Empress,
; and when the interview was over and he
had bowed himself out backward, he,
deeply impressed, remarked to his en
tourage: "Her Malesty is the only real
monarch of them all."
But, eway from the exigencies of her
court, Queen Victoria was "just a
woman." a simple, benevolent old lady,
who knitted stockings for the children of
her tenants at Balmoral, and took tea and
gossiped familiarly with their mothers, in
teresting herself in their Joys and troubles
and always welcomed for the sunshine
her presence brought Into their homes.
The Empress of India.
In 1876 the addition of Empress 6f In
dia was made to her titles by Disraeli,
who was rewarded with the title of Eari
of Beaconsfleld.
And now having dealt with the person
ality of the sovereign, let us briefly sur
vey the economical and social changes
that ha\*e been effected since her acces
sion, and the cataclysms and upheavals
that have diverted tlie course of the na
tions and transformed the map of the
world.
To begin with, in 1837 the population of
London was only a milHon and a half.
Now the number of persons within tin
metropolitan and city police districts Is
over elx millions. The people, now as
free as we "are, and enjeying as fully the
blessings of self-government, had no vote.
Flogging at the cartwheel was still in
order for both sexes: hanging was the
penalty for the most trivial offenses: men
were Imprisoned for debt; flogging was
in force In the army and navy; women
and children slaved for fifteen hours a
day In the mines; steam was In its in
fancy'; what Is now regarded as the most
ordinary and Indispensable adjuncts to
our comfort and civilization were un
known. . . . .

CHRONOLOGICAL RECORD
OF THE QUEEN'S REIGN
ARMY AT MATTILA
IS IN GOOD CONDITION
MacArthur Makes Prompt and Satis
factory Beply to General Cor
bin's Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â In view of the
debate In the Senate over the alleged
drunkenness and licentiousness in the
Philippines and lack of definite Informa
tion as to tha condition of affairs In the
respects mentioned Adjutant General Cor
bin, on the 16th lnst., cabled General Mac-
Arthur at Manila as follows:
Telegraph the condition of the army in Ma
nila and elsewhere In tho Philippines with ref
erence to drunkenness and use of Intoxicating
liquors. Are disorderly houses licensed pro
tected or in any way encouraged by the mili
tary authorities? CORB1N.
General MacArthur replied as follows:
MANILA, Jan. 17.â Adjutant General, Wash
ington: With reference to your telegram of
the 16th, drunkenness In this army ]g no more
noticeable here than in garrisons In the United
States; considering the whole rorce as a
unit probably very . much less, in Manila
'drunken men are very noticeable. The effect
of one drunkard in a public place creates the
Impression among citizens of extensive disor
ders throughout the whole force, which Is not
llio case." The army Is in splendid condition
and a high state of efficiency, doing the hard
est kind of service in a most faithful and ln
rrirlng manner. Disorderly/houses are not li
censed protected or encouraged.
MACARTHUR.
Strike Is Ended.
FLORENCE,' Colo., Jan. 19.â The strike
of the millmen of Florence was settled
to-day. President: Garman of the State
Federation of Labor, who has been here In
conference with both sides, announced to
night that the mill managers had signed
an agreement granting the main demands
of the men. including the eight-hour day
and the union wage scale./ The mills will
resume work at once. ..The agreement Is
for one year.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The report
from Havana that the Cuban constitution
may be completed In time to be consid
ered at this session of Congress has led
to discussion in Washington circles as to
the procedure likely to be adopted on a
document of this character. It is expect
ed that the constitution will be forwarded
to the President and by him submitted
to Congress, probably with recommenda
tions. In the House the understanding
prevails that any action on tho subject
would be framed by the InBUlar Commit
tee, but it is not clear what action. If
any, la called for relative to the constitu
tion of what is held to be foreign terri
tory, except as It contains provisions re
garding the United States. Chairman
Cooper of the Insular Committee says It
would not be for Congress to pass upon
or ratify the constitution, as it la for the
Cubans to do this for themselves. He
thinks It probable, however, that a de
claratory resolution could be framed, ex
pressing the views of Congress as to the
sufficiency of the constitution In insuring
a stable and pacific government for Cuba,
and perhaps laying down the general plan
of turning over the island affairs to the
Cubans as soon as their constitutional
system is put into practice.
In this, however, the purpose would not
be so much to pass on the constitution
as to see that the United States pledges
of a pacific government were carried out.
In case the constitution provides for an
American protectorate, or gives other pro
visions relating to the United States, spe
cial action might be required bevond the
mere resolution approving the system pro
posed.
Chairman Knox of the Committee on
Territories expressed the belief that there
is not the slightest chance of advancing
the constitution bo that it can be con
sidered at this session of Congress, and
he expects a Fabian policy by which the
Cubans will slowly perfect their system,
and the United States will gradually de
termine upon the ultimate relations which
are to exist between this country and
Cuba.
May Be Presented for Con
sideration at This
Session. *
the- truth will be annonunced to the na
tion. The extreme weakness of her Maj
esty and the loss of her faculties ap
pear to be at present the chief causes
of anxiety. Stimulants are being freely
administered.
In the opinion of those best qualified to
Judge, the Queen's present serious con
dition was precipitated by intense worry
over the losses and hardships suffered by
the British troops In South Africa. Fre
quently she has remarked to the court
attaches that another war would kill
her. ,
In this connection Reuter's Telegram
Company learns that she was most se
riously 11! while at Balmoral In the au
tumn. No word of this became public,
but it appears that she was then, almost
dying, though that rigorous etiquette
which she imposes alike upon her family
and attendants prevented her condition
even being spoken of as dangerous. The
present stroke Is a sequel to that which
occurred at Balmoral. If she survives it
she will not only be the longest-lived
monarch in England's history, but also
possessed of the most marvelous consti
tution of which woman- was ever en
dowed. Locally It i3 taken to be a coin
cidence that Sunday is the anniversary
of the death of Prince Henry of Batten
berg, for whom special memorial ser
vices are always held.
The arrival of the Prince oft Wales at
Osborne this evening, accompanied by
Home Secretary Ritchie, and the arrival
of the Princess of "Wales at 10 o'clock
to-night, occasioned no scenes of any kind.
They embarked upon the royal yacht Al
berta, and went up the little river sepa
rating Cowes from Osborne. Entering
royal carriages they were, driven through
the half gale which prevailed straight- to
the royal residence.
Mr. Ritchie, It Is understood, was es
pecially summoned to supervise the de
tails of the handing over to the Prince
of Wales the necessary authority to
transact state business.
Though no announcement of this trans
fer appears to be constitutionally neces
sary, or likely to be made, the tiny town
of Cowes, and, across the Medina 'River
separating them, East Cowes, are both
filling up with correspondents from all
parts of the world, and rents have risen
to fabulous prices.
Fearful sorrow, not unmixed with ex
pectation. Is written broadly upon every
face. That official secrecy which stops
all callers at the lodge gates does not
serve to mitigate the peneral dread that
pervades the Islands. Located almost as
Key West Is to the United States, they
hold in their 'bosom the most precious
and revered personality that a nation ever
worshiped, and It is the general Impres
sion that forty-eight hours will bring the
crisis of that feeble life upon which so
many International threads hang. The
country women paused In their Saturday
night shopping tours to pray that the
hand from death might be stayed from
falling on the big house over the Medina
River, but their prayers find little echo
in hope, for those who have seen the
Queen down here say she was only a
Fhadow of death. Yet the policeman ree
fers all callers to the bulletins and says
to all mechanically, "Slight Improve
ment." The dread word "paralysis" Is
carefully kept from the nation.

Hope Hanch Improvements.
SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 19.âThe story
Is revived here to the effect that the Pa
cific Improvement Company, owner of
Hope ranch and five thousand acres at the
headwaters of four principal streams out
of the Santa Ynez Mountains, is about lt>
improve Hope ranch. This tract com
prises two thousand acres four miles weat
of town. The company has spent $30,000
in developing water, having run a tunnel
In San Rooue Canyon six miles from the
ranch, which furnishes an unlimited sup
ply. This Is to connect with a reservoir
on the ranch, from which point all of
Santa Barbara and Goleta valleys can
be irrigated. Hope ranch is to be broken
up Into tracts of suitable size and sold on
the provision that extensive improvements
be made. It will form a suburb rivaling
El Montecito.

Buchanan, who is charged in a warrant
with having assaulted the girl. The

ney, former Mayor B. A. Noonan of St.

death warrant."

here next Monday, when it Is expected
that those of the Shotwell and of the
White factions who were engaged in the
troubles at Corbln this week will be in
dicted. After the arrest last night at Cor
bln of Paris Shotwell, Willis Cochran
John Bryant and Clay Kincaid, the last
two colored and all belonging to the Shot
well faction, It has been quiet here to-day
The Jailer heard voices during the nlgbt
and he thinks they were the voices of
friends of the Shotwells, who had come
over from Corbln to lynch White but
they found the Jail strongly guarded and
every preparation to receive a tnob. Each
faction is still accusing the other of pre
paring for violence, and there are some
who apprehend collisions when court con
venes next Monday. Although the troops
have been withdrawn the Sheriff has a
large force of deputies, and it is generally
believed that he is able to maintain peace
Meantime most of the disturbing elements
have been transferred from Corbin to the
Jail In this city.
The first to weigh in was Mike Coburn.
His wardrobe would beggar description
and must nearly have him. Black was
not de rigueur on the floor of Odd Fellows'
Hall, which lent a pleasant air of origi
nality to the proceeding. Light spring
suiting with something red In the color
scheme found favor. The sable coat of
Billy Shields was starter, with Abe
Levy. Jerome Basslty, Dave Harris. Joe
Cahill, Sandy McXaughton, Nat Boas,
Tom Burns, Tom Johnson, Jack Travis,
Billy Williams and Gene Heagerty as
assistants.
THE Jockeys and their friends got
away In a bunch at their annual
ball held at Odd Fellows' Hall
last night The only ones who
were left af the post were those "turned
down" on Invitations. They were many
and noisy over their disappointment. The
ball was the liveliest social function of
its kind ever held In this city and
It could not Â¦well help being racy.
There were Jockeys of every color, weight
and degree, and the ladles were there In
like number, and gowns that made the
arc lights woozy. There were no bad
actors and everybody got away well, al
though the running was pretty tame un
til they reached the half. Then the pace
began to crawl up. The orchestra played
Junk-time or any old time. It was all
one to the dancers. They were setting
such a gait that no collection of union
carded fiddlers could hope to keep In
the fleld. There were thirty dances on
the programme and after the last an
"etc."
The following well-known sportinp men
acted as Judges to count the votes cast
for the cup to be presented the favorite
Jockey: William (Kid) Nelson. George
Wller, William Lyons, J. Ladarre and
Edward Greaney.
Tod Sloan had to shoot clay pigeons to
day, otherwise he might have come to
show them how the thing Is done across

convention was "caviare to the general,"
entered for the "Spieler's stakes.
Jockeys were ever dear to the feminine
heart and last night proved no exception.
Eddie Jones, ; Skeets Martin, Mounce,
Clem Jenking, Joe Piggott, Tommy Burns
and Johnny Bullman had "the ladles
copped," as the man who sells overnight
entries remarked. He and- his colleagues
were classed as selling platers by the
haut ton. and consequently were spiteful

BA2CTA ROSA. Jan. 19.â The two-year
old fon of Mr. and Mrs. William Oeorgia.
:\iio reside on a. small place near the
<"ounty Farm, got hoM of a can of concen
t rated lye to-day and attempted to eat it.
Physicians wore Immediately summoned
snd although the child Is horrfbly burned
rlMiut the mouth It probably will recover.
Mrs. Warburton. the mother of the man
â¢who did the killine:, Â¦when informed of the
affair aTrp^arcd culte calm. She said that
f=r.e had expected pomethir.g of th<Â» kind.
Her per. this morning; had told her that
he would do some killir.G- before to-night.
Fh<? also Fald that the dead man called at
the villa this morning for his brother
Jack's clothes and thct Eh<* had warned
him to look out for her son, as he had
threatened to do him harm. She seemed
to believe that her eon was insane. She
hlro fciatod that it would have been much
tetter if he had killed himself and saved
others thÂ» sorrow his act entailed. As
time parses w'th no word a.fi to the cap
ture of the hunted man the belief here is
that he will take his life ard that his
body will be found in the rooming some
vrh*-r<? on the outskirts of the town.
r>Â«Â»Mn* runs high here to-night. Groups
of txelted men throng the corners and
Threats fill the air. Sheriff Taylor and his
deputies are blocking every avenue of
escape and if Warburton does not sur
render he will soon be captured.
It 1* said that Warburten was seen to
exhibit a pistol !n town to-night, making
the remark. 'Somebody will get this." So
much shooting talk has taken place over
the affair during the last month that lit
tle attention was paid to the ramark at
the time.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. JJ.â W. B. Warbur
toa to-nljht ahot and killed Matthew
Reilly at Billy Shannon's resort at Wut
End In this city. Warburtoa Is the pro
prietor of the Cyprets Villa and his vlo-
Uni was a young and popular blacksmith,
Â¦who crew up In this community. The
cause of the trouble can only be guessed
at. The etory as told by the eyewitnesses,
Thomas Kecgh and William Shannon,
ehow that Warburton was In the saloon
drinking. Reilly came In and spoke to
every one. Beelns Wartourton he said:
"Say. Warburton. I'd like to Â«ee you."
Warburton replied. "I don't want any
thing to do with you." Reilly then ad
vanced as thoug-h to remonstrate when
Warburton drew a pistol from the waist
band of his trousers and fired. The bullet
t ntered the elde of Reilly's head and he
:eil lifeless to the floor. Warburton then
cocked his revolver and backed out of
the place btA disappeared In the dark
r.ess. The ehootlng took place at about
U o'clock. Shortly afterward Sheriff Tay
lor arrived on the *cene and posted men
to watch for the missing man.
There is a long story, and as rumor
fays, a strange one back of the present
t hooting. About three weeks ago War
burton made a vidcus assault upon John
Reillr. a brother of the deceased. He
knocked him down and kicked him across
:).e sidewalk. It was thought at the time
that he Intended lo kill him. Previous
to the assault It is said that he had fol
lowed young Reilly all over town. Fear
for his life. It Is btlleved, caused John
Reilly to leave this city. It Is presumed
that Matt Reilly wanted to speak about
the affair to Warburton to-night and that
this led to the shooting.
Wartmrton is a man weighing about 220
pounds and Is quite an athlete. It is said
that he has lived at Santa Rosa. Sacra
ir.er.to and San Francisco, where he wan
once a member of the Olympic Club. He
has a mother living In this city. Reilly,
the deceased, -was one of the most popu
lar young men In this city. He leaves a
wife and two Email children. He was In
dustrious and peaceable and was In busi
ness for himself en Third street In this
city.

SATURDAY. Jan. 19â11 a. m.
; CHICAGO, Jan. 19.â Under close scrutiny a
steadier tone could be detected In the market
for wheat to-itey. Not that demand has im
proved, but the liquidation of long stuff dur
ing the day has the appearance of tall-end
holdings being thrown overboard to clear the
decks. May wheat opened H6Hc higher, at
74iiS74Hc and touched 74%c, the trade being
impressed by the firmness of cables, compared
I with weakness on this Bide yesterday. The
j bulge met slack support and a decline to 73%c
ensued. Heavy receipts, too, aided in depress
; Ing prices, but a very moderate amount of
! buying at the bottom near the end of the ses
sion caused a rally to 74Vi@74'/;c, and the close
was steady at Â»ic lower, at 74 l^c.
While corn was a very narrow market. moÂ«t
j ly within local confines and somewhat inclined
to hearken to the voice of the declining mar-
I ket. the tone was firm. Long stuff was firmly
i held.
May cloeed a shade higher.
Business In the oats market was very quiet.
Slay closed unchanged at 25*tiC. '
Provisions were quiet. The openintr was
firm, on light bog receipts and firm prices at
the stock yards. Hogs were weaker later and
they had an effect on provisions. May pork
closed 12>.^c lower, lard Be lower and May ribs
7%c lower.

1 and Texas and Pacific were also Btrong at ad
var.ceÂ» of 3V4 for Missouri Pacific; Wabash pre
ferred 2VÂ» and Texas Pacific 2H- The violent
break in Anaconda and Amalgamated Copper
had th<Â» first unsettling Influence on the mar
ket. The weakness was attributed to London
selling on account of the dull conditions In
the copper rtlarket. Anaconda broke 3Â«4 and
Amalgamated Copper 4^4. Both stocks rallied
in sympathy with the general utrength of the
market. In the final break declines resulted
In Brooklyn Transit of 5 points. Metropolitan,
4; Manhattan, 3^; St. Paul preferred, 4; Mis
souri Pacific, 3^; Steel and Wire, Z%; Federal
Steel. Erie first and Sugar, 2'4; Northern Pa
cific, 2H: Rock Island, 2^4, and a large number
of active stocks from 1 to 2 points. In the face
of the stock market liquidation, the enormous
Increase In the loan account of the banks of
152,841.000 waB a disagreeable shock to specu
lative sentiment and served to offset the cash
gain of nearly $14,000,000. There has been lar^e
placing of loans abroad during the week, but
special operations must be looked to explain
the loan Item. The payment on account of the
Pennsylvania Coal Company purchase and
larse borrowings by one of the great railroad
companies to carry purchases of stocks of other
railroads made last year are supposed to ac
count for some part of the increase.
The etock market during the week has shown
a state cf nervous apprehension among specu
lators of long stocks on a margin and a marked
failing off In the general demand for stock
which afforded a sure market for so prolonged
a period of extraordinary activity In trading.
The conviction had steadily gained force that
the prices reached by many stocks were in
flated and that the demand which lifted them
to that point was purely speculative.
The Belling has been largely forced by the
declines which the bear element has caused by
manipulation, thereby uncovering stop-loss or
ders and dislodging long Blocks. The bear tac
tics have been resisted by powerful speculative
interests which hav* been supporting orders in
the market. The bear element itself has been
so eager to anticipate the culmination of the
rise that they have kept the short account in
the market very large. This in Itself is a
powerful sustaining factor and represents a
practical discounting of the threatened liquida
tion. As a consequence there are large buying
i orders to take profits for short account at even
slight declines. The bear leadership has not
been bold or aggressive up to this time. The
influences have served to offset to a degree the
underlying weakness of the market. Various
developments during the week have demon
strated that speculators have misplaced their
confidence in many rumors that have been
afloat. Expected dividends have not been forth
coming; much herawd consolidations have
been disclaimed. The leading Incidents of this
class have been. the assertions by President
Hill of the Great Northern that he never
owned a share of Ft. Paul stock in his life:
the denial by an official of tha Metropolitan
street railway cf the reported lease of the Man
hattan: the lack of expected provision by the
Federal Steel directors for the quarterly dividend
on t^ie common stock during the coming year
and subsequent rumors of a bond issue and a
suspension of dividends In the future, and the
failure of the Erie directors to take any ac
tion on a dividend. There were so many other
unconfirmed predictions that speculative con
fidence was very much undermined. The com
mencement of gold exports had little effect on
the market.
Without doubt the most potent Influence on
speculation has been the disquieting evidence
of hostile conditions amonis the pr*at iron and
steel combinations. Mr. Carnegie's epigram,
"Iron Is either a kins or a pauper," directs at
tention to the periods of extreme depression to
which the Iron Industry has been subject in
thÂ« past and causes anxiety for the future of
the highly capitalized steel industrials, divi
dends on which are dependent upon a highly
prosperous condition of the industry. It Is evi
dent, also, that the division of business among
the great eteei corporations Is a subject of
friction and threatens competition and reprisals
that would demoralize profits in the Industry-
The announcement of a projected tube mill
by the Carnegie Interests at Conneaut, Ohio,
has beÂ«m supplemented by rumors of further
incursions Into the field of the various depart
ments. The admipslon by the Federal Steel
authorities of a contemplated bond issue I* ac
cepted as a note of preparation for a conflict.
From the speculative point it Is a matter of
notoriety In Wall street that there, are ani
mosities among the steel interests which are
ranged refpectlvely on the bull and the biar
sides of the market. The etock market has
felt the sympathetic effect of the violent fluc
tuations in the steel stocks, but the uneasiness
over the Iron an1 Fteel trade outlook has been
evpn more rffertive on speculatlce sentiment.
Bonds have moved in sympathy -with stocks.

NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â The weekly statement
of averages of tha Associated Banks shows:
Loans, $830,873,400; Increase. - $22,841,000. De
posits, $921,781,200; Increase, $36,451,000. Circu

$230.446.^00;' Increase. $9.112.S50. Surplus reserve,
$27.2i>6,6'>0; Increase, $4,S5S,ooO.
The Financier says:
The statement of the New Yorkclearlng-hous-e
banks for the week ended January 19 is the
most remarkable in several respects ever is-
Fiied. Not only were the. fluctuations Mn loans
and deposits the heaviest on record, but the
aggregate totals of these items are also the
highest known in the history of the. New York
barks. Significant as these figures are. how
ever, of the great volume, of business passing
through the banks, tlip result 1 ? as revealed In
the standing of the Institutions are even more
worthy of note. In the face- of an advance
in nft deposits amounting to $36,431,000, which
required an additional cash reserve of more
than nine million dollar*, the banks have been
sble to add $4.S5?,5. r i0 to their exceRS reserve,
the cash grnin having been almost fourteen
millions. The cash expansion reflects rather
correctly the gains the banks have made in
their dealings with the Interior and the sub-
Treasury, and the Item would have been higher
had it not been for the exports of specie earlier
in the week. The loan increase was $22,841,000,
and was brought about for the most part by
the financing of the Jersey Central and Penn
sylvania coal deals, both operations of unusual
magnitude. The pains in the leading items
were confined principally to half a dozen large
banks. Owing to the fact that the cash ex
pansion was not disturbed among the banks In
proportion to their increase In other Items, the
reserve percentages have undergone wide
fluctuations as compared with the usual
changes. The Btatement, despite tha record
brecklng figures, really indicates continued easy
money if tho accumulation of Idle cash In the
banks is taken as a criterion. The total specie
and letrals held by the clearing-houae now
amount In round numbers to $257,750,000. It Is
not surprising that Europe turns to this ac
cumulation as the representative of a store
of national wealth upon which drafts may be
made to meet emergencies. In passing it may
be said that the increase alone in the de
poFlts of the Sew York banks last week
anr.ounta to more than the aggregate deposits
of all the banks in quite a number of reserve
cities throughout . the United States.
To-day's bank statement showed record fluc
tuations In loans and deposits as compared
with the changes of any previous week of
clearing-house history. Bank officers were
puzzled by the $22,841,000 fraln In loans during
a period of considerable stock market liquida
tion and couM not -account for the showing
except by the fact that It indicated prepara
tions to finance some sort of a private rallroa.l
deal. In this connection It was -pointed out
that one Wall street bank to-day and yester
day had a credit balance at the clearing-house
aggregating Â£14,000,000. The Btatement also
showed a gain of $13,971,300 In cash holdings,
with an Increase of $4,853,550 In surplus bank

According to the report from the East In
the first column the cut In Prunes has nst re
sulted in any Improvement in tha demand,
which is still very slack. It is the experience
of veterans In trade, and It has almost become
ar. axiom in certain lines, that when any com
modity gets dirt cheap It does no good to still
further cheapen It, for no increase in the de
mand is evex-notlced. while the cut reduces the
proceeds to the producer Just so much more.
Experience Is the great teacher In trade, as
well as in other thinrs.

changes and added the Pacific Brand to the

The Board of Trade is still waiting for
an answer to a communication addressed
to the Pacific Mall Steamship Company
in reference to the establishment of direct
steamship connection between San F"ran
cisco and Manila. Henry Payot of Payot
& Uphaxn, who has just returned from
the Orient, having completed his third
tour around the world, brings valuable In
formation about transportation lines and
conditions relating tc the Philippine Isl
ands trade. He has talked with the ac
tive movers in the Board of Trade for a
through line and they are more convinced
than before that the through line is an
urgency. So said several members of the
board yesterday.
Mr. Payot said: "The only direct Amer
ican line running to Manila when I was
there was from New York. The vessels
from New York are carrying immense
careoes. The Japanese are running great
steamers from Yokohama to Manila.
They go full of Japanese goods. The
British India Steamship Company, run
ning to Singapore, Calcutta and Rangoon,
also goes to Manila. From Hongkong
there are two lines to Manila, and the
vessels of both lines go full every trip.
The North German Lloyds, which has
purchased many large steamshipB that
have been flying the British flag, will also
do business at Manila. There Is also a
French line. From Hongkong it is a jour
ney of only two days to Manila. Through
Fteamers to Manila would help to give
San Francisco the great trade that is
almost within its reach.
MANILA'S TRADE
PAYOT'S THEME
The Board of Supervisors, sitting as a
committee of the whole, yesterday after
noon resumed the investigation as to the
value of the property of the Spring Valley
"Water Company for the purpose of fixing
the water rates for the coming fiscal year
and also for tho proposed acquisition of
the water system by the city.
In the 'absence of Mayor Phelan, Super
visor Connor presided, the Super visors
present being Braunhart, Dwyer, Curtis,
Wilson. Jennings, McCarty. Boxton,
D'Ancona and Reed. Commissioners Men
dell, Manson and Maguire of the Board
of Public Works and City Engineer
Grunsky were also present.
Chief Engineer Schussler of the Spring
Valley Water Company was the only wit
ness examined at the meeting. The wit
ness stated that he had prepared a state
ment, as requested at the previous meet
ing, showing the value of the system of
the company he represented, but that the
statement was not complete. He asked
leave to read it. Supervisor Reed, who
conducted the examination, was opposed
to this, maintaining that the witness
should first answer the question as to the
total value of the water system, and that
any statement the engineer had prepared
should be filed with the board so that the
members might study it. A long argu
ment ensued between Reed and Schussler,
and as the engineer of the water company
could not give a definite answer as to the
value of the plant it was decided that he
be ! requested to finish the itemized state
ment and file it with the board at "the
next meeting.
Supervisor Reed then asked Engineer
Schussler to give a reason why in the city
of New York water was collected at a cost
of $29 per million gallons and sold to the
consumers for 55S, while in the city of San
Francisco the consumers were obliged to
pay $211 per million gallons. Engineer
Schussler entered into an elaborate state
ment, giving the cost of labor and mate
rial and varied climatic conditions as the
reason for the increased, cost of water to
the San Francisco consumer.
Various questions propounded by Super
visor Reed were characterized by En
gineer Schussler as being hpotheticaland
incorrect, and considerable time was spent
without eliciting any information from^the
witness.
Engineer Schussler then stated that the
Spring Valley Ccmpany should be allowed
to enjoy the profits of the increased value
of its property. /
He denied that the company had aban
doned the Point Lobos water system,
which it had acquired some years ago by
purchase. It was not being used at pres
ent but would be used In the near future.
Supervisor Reed then asked the witness
if it would not be a fair proposition for
the Supervisors to fix a water rate which
would pay the water company 5 per cent
on the total amount of money It had In
vested, plus the cost of operating and
taxes. To this question Engineer Schuss
ler answered in the negative.
The witness insisted that the company
should receive a profit from the increased
value of its lands, and that any property
it might use in the future but which It
was not using at present should be figured
on in arriving- at the value of the water
system. He denied that the Point Lobos
Creek water was contaminated by the
cemeteries or that the water taken from
Sunol Creek was not pure. If the city of
San Francisco could secure a water sys
tem sufficient for all purposes for $20,000,
000 he would not accept that figure as the
value of the Spring Valley plant, even if
his company had not Invested that
amount of money. The present daily
average capacity of the Spring Valley
Company was 20,000,000 gallons, and the
witness was requested to present figures
at the next meeting to snow what the
cost would be to increase the supply to
50,000,000 gallons.
When asked if the Spring Valley Com
pany had ever received less than 5 per
cent on Its total Investment Engineer
Schussler said he knew nothing 1 about the
receipts, and referred the Supervisors to
the cashier of the company. Supervisor
Reed and the witness had a long argu
ment as to the manner of fixing the valu
ation of the Spring Valley system, the
Supervisor scoring a point by stating that
the company had purchased its lands at a
low rate for water supply and that the
company could not sell an inch of the
ground for real estate purposes. The Su
preme Court had decided that In the pur
chase of a water system. by a city from a
company the basis of valuation must be
the amount of money actually expended,
and not the value placed upon the land
and plant by the water company.
Supervisor Reed Introduced a resolution
that the Board of Public Works be re
quested to furnish' a definite statement as
to the rates paid for water by banks, sta
bles, etc., under the fluctuating schedule
provided In the water ordinance, and re
port to the board as to whether a definite
rate cbuld not be fixed for this class of
consumers. Under the water ordinance
the water company has the right to
charge from 90 cents to $6. The investiga
tion will be resumed next Monday.
Engineer Schussler Says That Sys
tem Is Worth Far More Than
the Sum Expended
Upon It.
