21.â Notwithstanding the refusal of the
Senate to take action upon the French
reciprocity treaty the Paris Government
is willing to give the United States an
other opportunity to accept the Instru
ment and thus avert a hostile tariff com
bination of European States against this
country. Hopes of ratification of the
commercial treaty, by the Senate at this
session have been abandoned both by the
President and the . French Government,
and consideration has been given to the
advisability of extending the time set for
ratification. , The limit of time for the
ratification of the treaty" under the ex
tension negotiated a year ago is placed at
March 17. , .
The treaty has been before the Senate
for two sessions, and that body has had
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 21.â Early
this morning the famous Harvard pump
was blown up by vandals, and all Har
vard mourns Us loss. At 2 o'clock an ex
plosion took place, although it was not
powerful enough to awaken the occupants
of the dormitories, which are within a
few yards of the pump. Harvard gradu
ates of seventy years ago have tender
recollections of this pump, and the under
graduates of to-day look on It with simi
lar feelings. It was a necessary part of
the college, for it was one of the few
places in Cambridge where. a man could
get a drink of cool, pure water. It Is said
the pump willnot be replaced and the
well' will' be filled up. The present pump
was put in place in 1S32 and has remained
there ever since, Â¦ doing its work faith
fully.' The head of a bomb has been found,
proving beyond doubt 'that it was a case
of premeditated vandalism.

WASHINGTON*. Feb. a.â Three Umr.Â«
in as many days has the President toM
his callers that he believes an extra ses
sion Inevitable. Even stronger statements
by his friends were made to-day. Mr.
McKlnley Is reiterating his determination
so frequently that many persons are re
garding it as absolutely certain to oc
cur.
The President went further than ever
to-day by Indicating his intention to cail
an extra session to meet about two weeks
after his inauguration. This Is taken to
mean that it will be some time in th<t
week beginning March ISâ probably
March 20 or March 2L The President still
desires an extra session primarily on
Cuba. Fresh information he has been re
ceiving from Cuba conveys rtie good new*
that the Cubans are manifesting a more
liberal policy toward the United States
Government.
i This. In the President's opinion, does
nbt obviate the necessity for an extra ses
sion. "While many of the Cuban leaders
admit the right of this country to In
tervene in certain problems connected
with their government, the Cuban consti
tutional convention has not attached to
the constitution any paragraph defining
the relations which shall exist between
this republic and the one formed In
Cuba.
ample time in which to consider Its pro
visions. The President does not Intend to
extend the time of ratification unless
there is prospect of action, as he Is un
willing to place this Government in the
humiliating position of being unable to
carry out engagements solemnly entered
into by the executive and which cannot :
be put into force because the legislative
branch willfully declines to act. At the
same time the President is . keeping an
anxious eye on the economic situation In
Europe.
It Is absolutely necessary for the for
eign commerce of the United States, ac
cording to. administration officials, that
the French treaty should be ratified, and
a desperate effort will be made to bring
this about before the session ends, even
though the French Government Is willing
to extend the time of ratification, j

Feb. 21.â Mrs. Lovell White, pres
ident of the California Club, and
within range of our Instruments.
"Secretary Wilson Is fully alive to the
great benefits that would accrue from the
practical working of a wireless system
of transmitting messages. Therefore, act-
Ing under his direction, I began the work
about one year ago. I hope to be able
to report to the Secretary before the 1st
of April that our. experts have really
transmitted messages five hundred miles
on water. Â«
"Mr. Knight Is In error in saying- we
have transmitted messages five hundred
miles. We have only reached a distance
of between- sixty and seventy miles on
land, but we have stated that we believed
that we had an efficiency that would op
erate for five hundred mlles^ on water.
"Mr. Knight speaks of the synchroniza
tion of messages. I have to say for his
benefit that, notwithstanding erroneous
claims made by . others, no one has yet
accomplished this feat. I believe It is
possible to do so, and we have experi
ments under way that I believe will ulti
mately accomplish ' this much-sought ob
ject; but. when you consider that. In at
tuning electrical apparatus, you are deal-
Ing with vibrations of more than a billion
per second, it will.be apparent that great
refinement of mechanism Is necessary. I
can assure you we will take advantage of
anything that can be turned to the Inter
ests of the Pacific Coast."
i All of the members of the California
delegation -have .shown Mrs. -"White and
Mrs. Sharon every aid and Â¦ courtesy In
their endeavor to secuie legislative action
on the bill and whatever the outcome at
this session the project has acquired a
standing before Congress which. In cas<j
of failure, will place :t in a better posi

next session. The effort of the visiting
delegates of the' California Club will havo
borne good fruit If even this shall be ac
complished. It is 3ti!l hoped that the

Mr. Whlteside. owner of the Big Tree

Congress Soeaker Henderson will consult
: further .with the delecatlon and with .the
representatives of the California Club and
give his final decision In the matter.
The faculty has taken no action, be
cause the affair was merely a class con
test. President Graves says that he was
surprised that the upper classmen had
done things so undignified, but that noth

measures. The fight would be. a different
matter. The principals, however, expect

Robertson felt that he had not received
fair treatment at the hands of the juniors,
so this morning he Invited Paul Harper
to settle the question in a personal en
counter. Harper accepted. The meeting
was arranged for this afternoon, but ow
ing to publicity it was postponed. The two
declare that they will fight in secret
within the week. Bare fists will be the
weapons. Robertson says that after he
meets Harper he is willing to go down the
line with the Junior class, one by one.
Meanwhile the Juniors proceeded to the
girls' dormitory and locked up the senior
co-eds in their rooms. Miss May Thomp
son proposed to Miss Hubert and Miss
Prosch the daring plan of escaping; by a
rope made by knotting' sheets together.
Ty-ing her rope to the bedstead. Miss
Thompson climbed out the' third-story
window and started down. When about
.three-quarters the way to the ground her
strength failed and she fell, striking a
stone abuttment and suffering painful but
not dangerous injuries. Miss Thompson
gave the alarm to the young men. who
immediately xeleased their classmates.
They proceeded ,to the dormitory and
freed the girl seniors. The trunk was
then taken into the university building
and the banquet held about midnight.
Guy Robertson fought like a tiger. In
the struggle he was struck by one of the
crowd, and he made It a personal matter
with Paul Harper. The two were sepa
rated and Robertson was thrown down,
his legs were tied and his wrists fastened
with handcuffs. He was laid' on the grass
for safekeeping, but later managed to get
his legs .free and run to a. neighbor's
house, where the handcuffs were removed
with a cold chisel.
The seniors had obtained permission to
hold a meeting: in the president's room
and pjan for class day. As usual, there
were to be refreshments, â¢ and, as usual,
the Juniors determined to share the good
things. By secret service work the Juniors
learned that an adjacent grocery had the
pies, cakes and other eatables. Several of
the class went to the grocery and asked
for the goods. Believing them to.be se
niors, the clerk unsuspectingly turned
over the boxes. Later In the afternoon
the seniors learned of their loss.'; They
began to do a little detective work. At
about dusk Guy Robertson discovered
that the stolen sweets were In Howard
Cosgrove's trunk at the Sigma Nuffrater
nlty house. While the occupants were at
dinner Robertson, who Is a member of the
fraternity, admitted two other seniors,
who carried off the trunk, not knowing
that besides the eatables it contained Cos
grove's clothes and about $100 In cash.
The Juniors soon found that they were
outwitted. They placed a guard around
the main building": atHhe . univer^rfy.'ysSf
that, tho trunk conld-ifot be taken In. "â¢ It
was left under guard in the trees near by.
Then the Juniors decided to make the se
niors" meeting impossible. As each senior
appeared he was set upon by a crowd of
Juniors, overpowered and bound. Clarence
McDonald. Carl Reeves and the Rev. Mr.
Vail' were overcome by force, though the
minister won Â¦ the hearty respect of his
foes by leaving his marks on several of
their faces.
All this resulted from the Juniors' at
tempt to prevent a senior banquet. An
other chapter Is to be added when Guy
Robertson and Paul Harper meet In the
squared circle and settle their argument
with nature's weapons.

The court of honor along Pennsylvania

plan of the committee In carrying the
court of honor into the White Hou3O
grounds, right up to the front door of the
President's house.
The accommodations for the entertain
ment of distinguished visitors on the In
acgrural stand at the Capitol will be bet
ter and greater than on any similar occa
sion. The seating space extends over the
entire east front of the Capitol building
from the Senate wing to the House wing,
with capacity for more than 3000 persons.
Under ordinary circumstances the pres
ence of Senator Hanna in the came car
riage with President McKlnley would not
attract more than passing: notice, for it
is according to a long line of precedents
that two members of the Senate Commit
tee shall ride to the Capitol with the Pres
ident-elect on Inauguration day. and Sen
ator Hanna heads this committee.
To put it playfully, if there Is ra!n tha

Will Concur in Amendment Making

It Operative From First Day
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.-Senate bill 133. which
means the revised Code of Civil Proced
ure, passed the Senate to-day and went to
the Assembly. It has a string 1 to it, how
ever, for it was agreed in the Senate that
an amendment in the Assembly making
the- bill Operative from the first day of
the present session would be concurred
in. The Idea of this was that all those
amendments to the code passed In the
form of bills during the present session
would be nullified by the provisions of the
code bill unless Â¦when It were passed It
should be made retroactive so as to ante
date any of these amendments by special
bilj.
Cutter wanted the bill to go into effect
on January 1, 1503, hlj> idea being that if
there were any reallv*be.d features, in the
bill they would have but a few days to do
harm, for the session of the Legislature
would then be convening, and with two
years*, to study it Cutter thought the
legislators? could then amend it properly
and without delay. Senate bill 140, revis
ing the Civil Code, will be the- next, of the
code bills taken up. It will be put through
the same course as its predecessor. -'After
a few more amendments the Assembly
this evening passed Assembly bill 626 re
vising the Code cf Civil Procedure, to en
grossment and their reading.
â¢ Assembly bill 6S3, revising the Civil
Code, was made a special order for Mon

MERCED. Feb. 21. â Bob McFarland.
who has been known for years to bo a
desperate character, to-night shot and in
stantly killed James H. Tucker, keeper of
a notorious house in the Tenderloin dis
trict. The trouble had been brewing for
some time, as the murderer had been con
sorting with the dead man's former wife.
Tucker 'was a short time ago divorced
from his wife. Since the divorce there
has been trouble about the settlement of
the property. â . .
To-day their differences had a hearing
in court, and this evening they met in one
of the rooms of the Alameda House,
where they renewed their former quarrel.
Tucker striking the woman and throwing
he? into the street. Just about this time
McFarland made his appearance, and both
men began firing at each other. Several
shots were exchanged. Tucker was nit
twice. One bullet lodged in the temple,
causing instant death. Immediately alter
the aftalr McFarland started for town
and surrendered to the police.
Tucker when a young man Killed a
hunter with whom he was working be
cause he abused him.
McFarland's career has been an event
ful one. About fifteen years ago while
visiting the Tenderloin with a friend he
encountered a number of Portuguese, and
in the fight 'he and his companion
wounded tnree and killed one. He was
lodged In Jail, and escaped from It by dig
ging his way out, but was recaptured.
He afterward went to the southern part
of the State and shot another man. Clear
ing himself from that, he went to Mexico,
where he killed another man and was sen
tenced to be hanged, but was afterward
reprieved. .*:.-Â¦Â¦ - - â¢*Â¦ : - .Â¦; Â¦':Â¦Â¦'Â¦-*
After killing Tucker he surrendered and
was placed in the County Jail. When seen
to-night he claimed that the murdered
man was lying in wait to kill him and
that after seeing -the pistol In his hand
he drew his revolver and fired five times.
The only marks he has of the affair are
powder marks on the wrist, showing that
the battle must have been at short range.

That during the administration of Patrick

tource of this finding being the sworn testi
mony or .said Crowley before this committee)
said Crowley was offered a bribe 6f $6000 by
the keepers of brothels in said Chinatown for

State's anti-brothel laws, and that said.Crow
ley promptly brought the matter to the at
tention of the Police Commission of said city.
That during the administration of said
William P. Sullivan Jr. as Chief of Police of
sbld city the Chinese agent of one of the
principal Chinese gamblers of said Chinatown
sent to San Jose tor the Santa Clara business
rt-r resentatlve of said James D. Phelan; that
said business representative thereupon visited
Stn Francisco and conferred with said Chinese
agent; that said Chinese nijent, during, said
conference, offered said business representative
of said Phelan a bribe of $200 per month and
cfl'ered to pay a large sum every month to a
i>erson' to be subsequently agreed upon, the
stated purpose oÂ£ both bribes to be a degree
of Immunity from police raids of gambling re-
Eorts in said Chinatown; that eaid business
representative of said Phelan forthwith brought
the felonious proposal to the attention of said
Pbelan; that said Phelan was Informed of
the name of the bribe offerer and tfie charac
ter of the proposal, but the testimony of said
Phelan does not disclose that he endeavored
to bring the offender or his principal to jus
tice.
! " That .within the- last two months
keepers of Chinese' Rambling resorts

with prohibited eambllns -was no't
feared, intimations being thrown,
oat that an . understanding existed
between -the police and the- law
breakers whereby lnwbrenkinj; 1

, That while no direct evidence Is before your
committee showing the passage of bribe money
to the said Police Department evidence was
adduced pointing to the collection of a China
town corruption fund, and until there shall
te a strong and decisive effort to enforce the
laws of ' California in said Chinatown your
committee must feel that there are con
vincing grounds for believing that money does
pass, though the evidence is not sufficiently
clear to justify your committee In attempting
lo fay to whom.
- That there has been no attempt
whatever on the part of nntd Police
Department . to enforce the provis
ion m of Hcction :!<>:> of the Penal
Code, which make it a niindemeanor
(or any pernon to keep any minor
of ; either Â«cx In nnjr house of illâ

of section 31ft of the Penal Code,
tvlilck iiinUr it a misdemeanor for
an>~ ' person or persons to let any
npertment or tenement knowing-,
that It In to be used for degrading
pnrpones.
It is also found that there has been an utter
disregard. of -and no attempt -whatever -to-en
force the provisions of Eection 328 of the Fenal
Code, which make it a misdemeanor for any
Krson to let or permit any building or vessel,
or any portion thereof, knowing that it is to be
used for lottery purposes, and also that said
I ollce Department has willfully failed to en
fcrce the provisions of section 331. of the Penal
Code, which make it a misdemeanor -to know
ingly permit any of the games mentioned In
section 330 of said code to be played,, con
ducted or dealt in any house owned or rented
ty the accused in whole or In part. Â¦
'That, in view 'of all the evidence adduced,
your committee believes and Â« concludes that
the task of suppressing the slave traffic- in
this State will be made less difficult if those
changes be made Â¦ in the laws >which are pro
posed in the bills now before the Legislature
and known as Assembly bill No. 768 and As
sembly bill No. 769. Therefore your comtnit
tPe . strongly recommends the passage of said
bills. Â¦ â¢--.-, ..â¢;'...
But it is the belief and conclusion of your
committee that the laws of this State are ade
cunte in the matter of the suppression of lot
teries and Kambllrtff in said Chinatown: and In
tliis. regard attention Is Invlfed to'the code
provisions hereinbefore' referred to" and also
to the circumstance that the laws of Califor
nia contain other' valuable provisions which,
with- vigorous effort on the part of said Po
lice Department- and .the District Attorm-y of
said San Francisco, â¢ . would quickly free the
commonwealth of the conditions. In said Chlna
tewn now .dUgracUiR.lt. , Those other provis
ipns may be summarized as follows: .
.1. It" Is well -''-settled at law that brothels
and gambling-houses ( (especially gambling-
N-usesi In which games, prohibited by law- are
played) are public nuisances.
2. Under "the act of February 7, 1874 (Stat.
1ST4,' p. 84),, houses of .ill fame; are declared to
be public nuisances and; common repute is
made competent, evidence, of. the character of
the hous?s. ' ' f' v ;z~''-
2. Under the act "authorizing and directing
district attorneys to bring suits to abate pub
\Vi nuisances (Stat. .1899. -p. 103); the District
Attorney of San . Francisco may, and when
directed by the Board of Supervisors must,

ond chapter V of the Code of Civil Procedure,
cud especially â¢ section t?03 thereof.)
Wherefore, your committee' recommends:
That the Mayor, the Police: Commission and
the Chief of Police of said city and county of
San Francisco , proceed forthwith to enforce
the laws' of .the State of California in said
Chinatown, "v- Â¦'.'Â¦ . . Â¦. . .
That the District . 'Attorney ' ' of said

Ue no discrimination" against these sub
ordinates. â¢ If they were in' contempt, Sul
livan and Wittman were equally so.
:.. . Investigation a Farce. c ' Â»
Webber argued that the contempt con
sisted in the change of. date in the sub
poena. Macbeth argued that rto contempt
had been committed, the subpoena hav
ing been nullified by its service on Coffey.
Feliz said- the investigatlonwas a farce
from the beginning, not actuated by sin
cere motives. Instead of censure, the de
fendants deserved to 'be' patted on the
back. Carter said the defendants had
confessed to the act in contempt of the
authority of the Assembly. However, if
one were guilty they were all guilty, from
the Chief of Police down. Dunlap argued
for careful consideration and said that the
fraudulent use of the subpoena, was an
act in contempt of the Assembly.
Laird, a member of the committee, said
the proceeding of the Chief in the Cram
case had convinced him that the police
had tried to unfairly influence the com
mittee by giving the Impression that
Boyle, acting in the interests of a news
paper, was not trying to find witnesses
whose testimony was needed. He believed
the defendants ought to be reprimanded.
It was a concocted plan to throw dis
credit on all the evidence that had been
offered.
Kisk spoke In favor of the Knowland
resolution, and Johnson made a long ar
gument in the same line. He said his
tory was being made and that the As
sembly ought not to remit its authority
or permit detraction from Its dignity.
Brown of San Mateo and Cowan made
pleas that equal justice should be meted
to the four defendants.: The previous
question finally stopped debate. On the
completion of the roll call the vote stood
2y ayes to 30 noes, but the call of the ab
sentees produced two more affirmative
votes, and the Speaker declared the reso
lution of censure adopted.
Equal Justice for All.
Webber, a member of the Investigation
committee, moved that proceedings
against Captain Wittman and Chief of
Police Sullivan be dismissed. Schlesinger
and Guilfoyle spoke vehemently against
such action, in view of the censure that
had been visited upon the subordinates.
The motion was lost. Brown of San Ma
teo moved that Captain Wittman be In
cluded in the reprimand, and that the
case of Chief Suiilvan be continued one
week. Mattos moved as a substitute that
Captain Wittman be dismissed. In the
midst of the debate that these motions
provoked Wittman made his statement,
acknowledging his responsibility for the
issuance of the subpena.
"After the manly statement by Captain
Wittman," Schlesinger said, "I am in fa
vor of his dismissal. Such action will be
a complete -vindication of Wren and Cof
fey." Â¦ -
Others thought that Wittman's state
ment should be rewarded by immediate
dismissal. Johnscn took the opposite view
an<J. insinuated plainly, that Wittman's
stand was taken rather late to be consid
ered manly. Flsk said bluntly that If
Wittman and Sullivan were not guilty the
subordinates were not, and If Wittman
were dismissed he would move to rescind
the motion by which â¢ Wren and Coffey
were censured. On roll call Mattos' bud
s'titute motion received 22 votes to *2S>
ngainst it. A call of the absentees pro-'
duced 2 noes and a call of the House, with
some changes, left the vote at 28 ayes and
S5 noes, and the motion was declared lost.
Brown's motion was then carried by a
vote of 27 to 22.
At .the evening session Flsk moved that
censure of the three defendants be indefi
nitely postponed. The motion prevailed,
and the defendants were allowed to go on
their own recognizance.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
CAT,!., HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. I- en. 21.â The Assembly devoted
a part of its morning session and all of Its
.afternoon session to the determination of
v. hethc-r or not its dignity had been placed \
la contempt by the" action of Chief of Po
lice Sullivan, Captain Wittman, Detective I
Wren and Joseph V. Coffey in the matter
of the Cram subpena. In' the afternoon;
the Assembly decided to direct the gpeak
*r to censure Wittman, Wren arid Coffey,.
postponing: the decision In Sullivan's case:
until he should be able to appear before
them. At night the Assembly partially
relented and postponed indefinitely the.
administration of the reprimand, letting
the defendauts go on their own recogniz- j
cnee.
The discussion throughout the day was
fraught with interesting features, and the
crowd of spectators that thronged the j
lobby and gaileiy vras amply entertained, j
The programme broke down, and every
new motion or substitute or amendment
produced kaleidoscopic changes, that
were entirely perplexing to those who
were trying to get a line on the probable
result of it all.'
In the early part of the afternoon ses
sion It became evident that the powers
t'.^at be had decided that the subordinates,
AVren and Cofley, were to be made scape
goats.
Apparently they had come to a realiza
tion of a weakness in their case and
tea red that an amendment to censure all
would result in the escape of all, and a
failure to secure a vindication of those
who had asserted that an offense against
the Assembly's dignity had been commit
ted. The case was threshed over in a
<iozen speeches, some contending that Sul
jivan and Wittman were innocent of any
offense. A strong minority, among them
most of the San Francisco contingent,
held that if the little fellows were In con
t< zr.pl their superiors, who were present
when the offense was committed, were
equally guilty.
Cheap Play for Favor.
Captain Witunan sat between Wren and
Coney at the bar of the Assembly and
lizard all the animadversions upon his
Mibordinates, and said not a word nor
asked the privilege to say a word until
the Assembly had adjudged them guilty
<t contempt and voted censure upon
them. Then, when he was placed in the
vortex of criticism, he made a cheap play
for favcr by stating, after receiving spe
cial permission, that he was present when
tiie subpena was Issued and that it would
not be the part of a man to de,ny respon
sibility. If any one was guilty of cen
s-ure, "he said, he was ready to take his
j;anishment.
%he bait was alluring. A burst of
tkeers attested the belief of many that
Wittman had done the manly thing. But
Johnson. Fisk and others felt that Witt
rr.an had kept silence too long, and in
ttcad of aisimsjinsr the proceedings
r.painst the captain â the motion under
considerationâcensure was voted upon
him by a larger majority than that by
which Wren and Coffey were condemned.
Captain Wittman. Detective Wren and
Attorney Coffey were called before the
bar of the Assembly shortly after 12 .
â¢/clock. A statement from President New
hall of the Board of Police Commissioners
jt!itl froca Dr. John Gallwey established
the fact of the illness of Chief of - Police ,
{Sullivan.
Wittman Asks Justice.
Wittman and Wren waived the right to
the services of an attorney, and Witt
man was asked if he had any statement
to make. He spoke at some length and j
made an excellent impression upon the
1Â» gisliitors and evidently pained the sym
pa.tfcy of the spectators why crowded the
lobby. His manner was most respectful,
but was by no means lamblike, and he
look occasion to insinuate very plainly
that the journal that stood sponsor for
l!ie Investigation was willing to let It pro
<â¢Â«Â¦ e<I to a certain point and no further;
that it possible witnesses were likely to
Â£i\*p testimony inimical to its cause it was I
. announced that they could not be pro
ducea before the committee; and that the
Investigation Which had been welcomed
by himself and his superiors in the hope
that it would be complete and impartial
had stopped short of completeness and
Justice.
Once a happy reply of Wittman's
aroused the laughter of Assemblymen and
spectators. Carter essayed the role of in
tjuisitor nnd asked concerning the asser
tion that Witness Cram was put through
the â¢â¢.sweating process" in the office of
th? Chief of Police.
"Cram underwent no more of a sweat
ing process," replied Wittman, "than I
am undergolpx now."-
Welcomed Investigation. !
Whtman's preliminary statement was
c:- follows:
"If th<?r2 was any contempt committed
in the matter of the service of the sub
poena on Cram, it was not intended. Our
only intention was to aid the Investigating
committee. I appeal to the members of
that committee if it is not true that the
Police Department lent it every aid within
its power. We welcomed the investigation
and boped that it would be conducted
fairly and impartially, . and we offered
every facility we hatl to enable the com

LONDON. Fob. 21.â John Redmond In
the' House of Commons to-day moved an"
amendment favoring a system of compui
sory sale of lands, in Ireland. The. only
permanent, solution of the Irish land
question, he said, was the immediate cre
ntion of an occupying proprietary. The
amendment was secondert.by 'Thomas \V.
Russell, Llberal-Union ! st, who asked:
' "What Is it not worth to end this land
question forever? From this day forward
Parliament had a' new Ireland to deal
with." *
Although a, Unionist, he said, he-in
tended to support this demand of the Na
tionalists: ;
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman said he
thought the fact that f>5 per cent of the
Irish members advocated purchase' was
the strongest argument in its favor
Mr. Russell then moved the . closure
which was carried by a vote of 251 to 13''

He v.as one of the delegates at large from
this State to the National Democratic
Convention at Kansas City in July last,
and vras one of the most forceful person

in seconding the nomination of Bryan was
an exhibit of his ability as an orator and
a statesman and the loyalty and energy
With which he followed his "words by his
action*; From July to the time of the
elect i. i in November he gave In full
measure his best counsels and work to
the success of his ticket, and when the
Democratic banners went down in defeat
he accepted the situation without murmur
and returned to his desk to await the next
call.
Mr. White held durfng his life a number
of appointive offices, the most Important
of which were trustee of the State Nor
mal School at Los Angelos. to which h*.
was appointed in 18S7 and served till 1S!U
and Recent of the State University, to
which he was appointed by Governor
Gage in JSM for a term expiring in 1901.
Mr. White was married eighteen years
ago to Miss Hortense SactHste of Los An

of whom is about 16 years old. are left to
mourn his loss. Mr father died ten years

*o Important a place in the affalri of this
commonwealth, therefor* be It
"ff? lved - Th Â»t Â«n the death of Stephen M.
Whit* our State has lost a man whose every
act in private and public life was governed by
a desire to aid the State which was honored by
his birth and whose career as a public man
was free from blot or blemish or scandal or
taint of corruption, and who in his private
life displayed those amiable qualities which
attached men to him as with hooks of . steel,
reircrdlers of their political faith, and whom as
a citizen it was the pride and pleasure of all
to know and claim as a friend, and who has
by t&e success which attended his efforts in
1 traded general attention by hi? tact and
ability as a presiding officer.
In 1SS6 he was again chosen as chairman
of the State convention which nominated
Governor Bartlett. and was subsequently
the successful aspirant for the State Set;
atorship of the Thirty-eighth District.
In the State convention of 1SS8 White
was chairman of the committee on reso
lutions and was elected as a delegate xo
the National Democratic Convention at
St. Ixniis." At that gathering he became
at once a figure of national importance,
being chosen temporary chairman of the
convention and conducting its proceed
ings during a large portion of its session
with consummate ability and fairness.'
Durins: 1&<* and ISM Mr. White was Lieu
tenant Governor ex-oflicio. In 1E.V7 Gover
nor Bartlett. the Democratic Governor,
died ar.d R. W. Waterman. Republican
Lieutenant Governor, became Governor,
and Mr. White, as president of the State
Senate, succeeded to the office of Lieuten
ant Governor.
Mr. White In 1S90 made the question of
section of United States Senators by di
rect vote of the people a leading one. He
was at the time the announced candidate
for the offict? himself, and his speech be
fore the State convention at San Jose
upon the subject of Senatorial indorse
ment attracted widespread and favorable
comment.
He vigorously advocated the Democratic
ticket and argued forcibly against the
election of men to the Senate by corrupt
methods.
He received allof the votes of the Dem
ocratic minority of the Legislature, but
was defeated, only, however, to be
marked for renomlnation three years
later.
In the Presidential campaign of 1S92
Mr. White was active in the interests of
his party and engapred in a series of de
bates upon the tariff issue with Hon. M.
M. F.stee, now United States Judge in
Hawaii, who championed the Republican
side of the question. '
The Legislature which convened In ISM
consisted of 59 Democrats. 51 Repub
licans, 5 Democratic and Peoples,
2 Peoples and Republican. 1 Popu
list. 1 Non-Partlsan and 1 Inde
pendent. In the Joint Senatorial conven
tion of the two houses Mr. White was
elected on the first ballot, receiving 61
votesâ those of all the Democratic mem
bers, one Non-Partisan vote and one Pop
ulist vote. He took his seat March 4, lSltf.
and frcm that time until the expiration of
his term. In 1S99. kept the members of th-^
national body mindful of the s fact that
California could send men d brains and
statesmanship to .represent 'her at Wash
ington.
Upon the expiration of his term as Sen
ator Mr. White returned to Los Angeles,
where he was received by the citizens
with one of the grandest ovations ever
tendered there' to a retiring public ser
vant. He at once resumed the practice
of his profession, but was frequently
called upon to do service in one capacity
or another for his people and his party.
He made some notable addresses In 1893
on the political condition of the country.
At the legislative session In the early part
or the year he was complimented by the
Democratic minority with the nomination
therenf to be defrayed by popular sub
scription, the voluntary offering of a
grateful people.
"As a mark of respect to the memory
rif this emlnont and faithful public ser
vant I request that the City Hall be closed
on Saturday. Fobruaiy 23, the day of his
obsequies, and that the City llall flag be

Stephen Mallory White was born 'n
Ean Francisco, January 19. 1S53. He w-is
the son of Mr. and Mrs. William F.
"White, argonauts from New York. H>.
was related on his father's side to GeraM
OrifSn and the celebrated orator. W
Uourke Coclcran. and on his mother's side
to the well-known Mallory family.
The parents came arouna Cape Horn
from New Terk to San Francisco in 1S49
His father Â«*ng;agred In the .merchandise
business with much success until Sep
tember. 1K3, when, having sustained xe
vere losses by reason of the great fires
devastated the metropolis In ton
spring and Â»uinmer of that year, he
moved with his family to the Pajaro Val
ley, Santa Clara County,, where he re
dded for the next twenty-five years.
There young Stephen White passed the
*arly period of his life. His earlier edu
cation was acquired by home instruction
and then at the public and private schools
of the neighborhood. He wa:iwell ad
vanced at the age of 15, and was sent,
Â¦with his older brother. Edward, to St.
Ignatius College. San Francisco, and
then to Santa Clara College, at Santa
Clara, Cal. lie was graduated from the
latter Institution with honors in 1S71.
when but five months over 18 years oi-i.
and he at once began the study of law.
for which he evinced much aptitude and
which hÂ« had long before chosen as his
profession.
The youngr man studied first with
Judge A. W. Blair, and then finished hir.
legal training in Santa Cruz under the
guidance first of Judge Hagan and after
ward under C. B. Younger. After two
years and a half of close application, and
just after h<Â» had attained his majority,
he was admited to the bar of the Su
preme Court. April. 1S74. In November
of the same year he commenced practic
ing In Los Angeles, where he thereafter
made his residence.
From the first White was successful,
and his r.ame soon began to be a familiar
one In court circles in the southern end
of the State. He was engaged in many
prominent case?, and his speech in ore
of these, in which the rlefendant was a
mÂ«ii of large wealth and well known all
over the country, gave him something oC
a national refutation.
In 1S75 Mr. White made his debut as a
candidate for office, though he had al
ways been active in the political affairs
of his city and county. He was nomi
nated for District Attorney of Los An
geles County on an independent ticket
and. although defeated, had the honor of
running for ahead of his ticket.
This evidence of his ability and popu
larity put his nam? and service in de
mand from that time forward whenever
a political fight was on hand.
In 1S76 he was assigned a prominent
part with important duties in the can
vaj*s of the State for Tllden, and likewise
In 1S7*.
In 1879 he took no part in State poll
tics, presumably on account of the fact
that his father was a candidate for Gov
ernor on the Workingman's ticket, and he
had little faith In the prospect of that
organization accomplishing any of ths
purposes for which it was formed.
In 18S0 he was a delegate from his coun
ty to the Democratic State Convention nt
Oakland, and took a very active part In
Its proceedings. At the San Jose con
vention In 1SS2 he nominated Georgo
btoncman for Governor, and In the cam

Since the return of Mrs.- Atherton the
Grosvenor family (the Duke's name is
Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor) hag
been engaged in an attempt to prevent
the case getting into the courts. The
Countess of Grosvenor. the Duke's moth
er, invited Mrs. Atherton to her house.
This move silenced the gossips for some
time. Then came the report of the ser
vice of a citation on the Duke of West
minster the day of his marriage, which
was disproved by the fact that the suit
was not then filed.
The Duke of Westminster, then Lord
Belprave. and the brother of a well
known South African millionaire, whose
r.ame has also been mentioned with that
of Mrs. Athprton. were at the same camp.
For a long time Major Atherton remained
in ignorance of the camp gossip, but
finally of his brother officers notified
him of the facts in the case. Mrs. Ather

has filed a suit for divorce
apainst his wife, Mary Louise Atherton,
naming- the Duke of Westminster as co

been expected. Within the past thirty-six
hours a lawyer who is looked upon as the
leader of the divorce court bar has been
retained In behalf of the petitioner. The
case cannot be aired in court, at any rate
for some months and possibly not before
autumn, and the friends of the Just-mar
ried Duke may not succeed In compromis

But as Major Atherton is reported to
have already refused a check for Â£40.009

to have sustained, the task ahead of

ST. PAUL, Feb. 21.â Something of a sen
ration was created here to-day when tt
became known that Patrick Hussey, a
well known local charncter, and John Â£.
Lynp. a highly respected contractor o"
Minneapolis, had been taken into custody
on a warrant charging them with being
implicated in the abduction of young
Cudahy at Omaha. The warrant was
sworn out by John M. fiaum, who said he
was a detective from Omaha, but who. It
late.r developed, was a local "amateur
sleuth."
It appears that Baum. working on al
leged "clews." had developed what seemed
to him a gigantic conspiracy, which in
cluded a number of men and women, and
he told the County Attorney such a plau
slb'e story that that official issued the
warrants. Both men have been released
and the police officials consider the affair
a huge joke.

OMAHA, Feb. 21.â The courtroom was
crowded when James Callahan, the al
leged kidnaper of Edward Cudahy Jr.,
was arraigned for a hearing before Judge
Vinsonhaler in the County Court this
morning. Three complaintsâ grand lar
ceny, robbery and false imprisonmentâ
were read to him by the County Attorney,
to all of which he pleaded not guilty. The
court asked Callahan If he had engaged
counsel, to which he replied that he had
had no opportunity to do so, and the
hearing was continued until Monday at 10
a, m.. at which time, Callahan said, he
would be ready for trial. Ills ball was
fixed at $2500 on each count, which he
could not furnish.
Mrs. George F. "Wittus to-day positively
identified Callahan as the man she saw
repeatedly in the neighborhood of the

IN DIVORCE SCANDAL
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, ; FEBRUARY 'J2, 1901.

No event in the political career of Senator White per
haps had greater significance than his action in the Dem
ocratic convention at San Jose in the latter part of Au
pust, 1S90. White sought indorsement at the polls, at the
gubernatorial election to follow, of his candidacy for
United States Senator. He was ooinbated by a portion
of the Democratic press, and the party was nearly rent
with internal dissensions.
It was on the morning of August 20 that the commit
tee on permanent organization and order of business re
ported. All thÂ«Â» delegates were in fever of excitement.
The sixteenth section of the committee's report, as pre
sented by Chairman Fopper, read:
"Sixteenthâ Indorsement of a United States Senator to
be elected at the next State flection."
Delegate Ashe moved to amend the report by striking
out this section.
"I second the motion to adopt the minority report."
said White from his seat on the floor among the Los An
geles delegation. Fcr a moment every member of the
convention seemed struck dumb. A few of the brighter
minds saw the drift of his motion, yelled "Platform" and
White in response to the demand, which Increased in vol
ume every moment, Flood near the chairman. He reiter
ated his second to the motion and said:
"Recognizing that this great convention is assembled
for the general good of the public, and that it is gravely
charged with the responsibility for the welfare of the
Democratic party and the people at large, despite the as
sertion of my enemies and malice of those whose business
seems to be that of common slander, I have resolved this
day to sacrifice my highest aspirations in the Interest of
harmony and for the good of the party.
"I have been denounced, as you ore' aware. In many
ways during the continuance of my candidacy. Only this
morning I have been described as bearing a torch to fire
- the temple of Democratic unity. I need not say to those
who know me how false a charge this is. I would not-for
any cause act in any way that would lose to the Demo
cratic party a single vote, and since It seems there are
some who threaten the party because of the proposal to
indorse me I will give way. .
"It has been charge('that I have come into this can
vass from a spirit of disloyalty to my friends and wl'h
the intention of weakening the candidacy of a man who
has always boen my friend. This is false. I have nÂ°ver
been disloyal to the party, nor have I ever been dislovil
to any claims of friendship. Heaven has manv bright
things for the human heart which adorn life, but* there is
not among them all any jewel which shines brighter than
loyalty to friendship. It Is In this belief that I live It is
in this that I act in all my doings with my fellow beings."

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
By Louis Honig.
THE smooth sailing of first and
second choices was suddenly
changed yesterday afternoon
when Rio Chlco, 60 to 1, with
Buchanan up, won the mile race,
the fourth on the card. Rio was "the one
far away and unquestioned rank outsider
âthat is, before the race. Phoenician, a
7 to 5 favorite, and Imperious, second
choice at 13 to 5, finished at the "tail end
of th.5 programme, but that's the sad
story. This is the Joke: Rio took the
lead with the rest of the field closing in.
They all tried to catch him, but Walken-
Fhaw was the single flier that had a
chance. Up the back stretch and down
Into the stretch Rio came on In the lead,
Walkenshaw closing up the gap and Pres
tome coming into the play. In a hard,
driving finish the three raced their necks
off from the paddock to the wire. Rio
won by a head and it looked as if Walken
ehaw had made the place, but the Judges'
discriminating eyes settled upon Prestome
for the second honor, and Walkenshaw
for the Bhow. Walkenshaw sold- at 9 to 1,
Prestome at 10 to 1.
Rio Chico was played by a few habitual
leng-shot exploiters. Gus Abercrombie
made a winning of $2500 on the race, and
Mr. Zlnkand took away about $1000 Just
because Rio nosed out under the wire.
Bogus Bill gave the lie to his name in
the first race and redeemed the poor work
of the Jockey who rode him on the preced
ing day. Quoted at 2\i to 1 against the
favorite. Sweet William. Bogus Bill with
Murphy up won an easy five and a half
furlongs. Santa Lucia at 3 to 1 led up to
the stretch, but was then passed by
Bogus Bill. Sweet William came In for
the place.
j Montanlc captured the $100 purse from
such company as Wyoming, Gonfalon and
Rio de Altar. Wyoming was the favorite
at ev.cn money, Montanic being posted at
8 to 5. Wyoming's -start was as -poor as
Montanic's was good. Buchanan on Mon
tanic took tho bandmaster's position and
did the leading all the heavy way. ; At
the far turn Wyoming began to go up,
and O'Connor drove hard to catch the
loader. The advantage was too much to
be' overcome a*id ' Montanlc I took first
money, Wyoming several lengths of
bright daylight in the wake.
There was nothing to the third race.

the fcnly hoofers -that counted. Mamie

strong fihlsh. â¢ ,*". r" :
Ieallne won the fifth race handily. This
race was over the six furlong route and
was nothing but Isaline. Invictus got the
place and Mocorito the show.

stretch was reached Mac Gyle look a de

and holding, resulting in the downfall of
five favorites. Young Morello, ridden by
little Brodien, proved the star long-shot
performer, capturing the opening event
at odds of 40 ta 1. fairly well backed.
In the fifth number, a seven-furlong sell
ing affair, spectators were treated .to an
electrifying finish. Dandy Jim, Rollick
and Quiz II finishing heads on the wire
in the order mentioned.* As the stretch
turn was rounded the trio hooked up, and
at different stages llrst one; then another
looked the winner. Xash Turner had the
mount on Dandy Jim and was seen at his
best. He earned the verdict. Rollick, rid
den by Johnny Kullman, closed the post
favorite, while Mounco piloted Quiz. El
Topio, from the stable of Doble & Co., set
the pace to the bond for home, where he
st-nt in his regrets and retired.
Everything pointed to Companion as
possessing the most speed of the eight
starters in the Introductory scramble, and
with Dominick in the driver's seat the
filly closed a slight favorite over Hilary.
Trlstrain made quite a bluff of it out in
front for a time, with the first choice In
hot pursuit. Below the paddock gate
Companion showed signs of distress, and
Young Morello passing her, won almost
easily. Away none too well, Hilary fin
ished third.
Never at his best when the going was
inclined to be sticky or holding, Pat Mor
rtesey nevertheless opened up favorite for
the six furlong- run, next decided, and
later receded to twos. The smart ones
confined their betting operations to Good
Hope, and though Caesar Young's mare
made a very fair showing the 106 pounds
on her back was more than she could
handle, and Duckoy, ridden by the colored
lad. BasPinger. led past the wire by two
lengths. Morrissey ran third.
Bullman tossed the leg over Glenden
nfng. a fast son of St. Carlo, in the two
year-old dash, and the voungster won all
the way. He was played down to favor
itism and had something left at the fin
ish. Pepper Sauce took the place, a
length in advance of Maraschino.
Bookmaker Fred Cook's horse. The
Monk, looked, best on paper of the start
ers for the mile and seventy yard purse,
but his warming up gallop did not impress
bettors favorably and he cut no figure in
the race. Soon after the start Bullman
on I'arda assumed the front position, and
leading the entire route the old mare.fin
ished four lengths in advance of Ostler
Joe at the wire. Kiekumbob lost the show
to Homage.
Last on the card, a five and a half fur
long run. fell to The Buffoon, quoted in
the Tx>oks at odds of 8 and 10 to 1. The
outsider took to the going as a duck to
water, and handled to excellent advan
tage by Ransch downed Un Cadeau four
lengths. Katie Gibbons, the favorite, ran
a close uo third.

There -was a large attendance at tfta
handball tournament In the Olympic Club
court last evening. The crowd yelled for
the players, coached them, laughed at
their vain efforts to land on the boundins
ball and made merry generally at the ex
pense of the athletes, who are striving ta
win glory In the scientific Irish, game. Th^j
players puffed and perspired, smote thÂ«3
atmosphere with vicious swings and cut
enough capers to bring Joy to a dyspeptic.
George Birdsall. the club's heavyweight
overhand swiper, had trained faithfully for
his initial game, but Tom Mulvey. his op
ponent, defaulted. It developed that Mul
vey became a benedict the preceding day
ancl was oft on his honeymoon. Birdsall
accepted his victory with a gladaoma
smile and floated airily away Jerry
Johnson made Stanley Fay look like threa
dimes. The score at the close of tha
slaughter was: Johnson 61. Fay 19.
Then came John Cunningham, ana
Charles Melrose. Cunningham was in tha
pink of condition, having trained under
the watchful eyÂ» of Al Lean. His train
ing stood him in good stead, as Mr. Mel
rose made him skip and jump sideways In
the court.- Melrose won by a score of 51
to 32.
W. McLeod and Garnett Ferguson put
up the hottest gamÂ© of the night. Fergu
son, despite his handicap, was unable to
win from his far cleverer opponent Tha
score was 51 to 33. Lester Hammersmith
and Archie Taylor, better known as tha
"old man." then put In an appearance.
Lester played rings around his aged rival
and when time was called he had 40 ta

On Sunday afternoon the following

On Monday evening George Birdsall and

a great deal of rivalry between them and,
the contest will be an exciting one. Levy
has beaten Birdsall in practice, but tha

Fruit Association Directors
Given Authority to Bor
row Money.
?
Special Dispatch \o The CalL
SAN JOSE, Feb. 21.â The biff pnino
combine will borrow $200,000. cr such, part
thereof as needed, for advertising 1 pur.
poses, establish agencies in the larÂ»e
Eastern cities, put scores of salesmen Jn
the field and put pretty young lady dem
onstrators In stores to serve prunes to th3
public in various forms in order to creata
a greater consumption of California's
dried fruit product.
Authority to do this was granted tha
directors of the California Cured Fruit
Association by practically a unanimous
vote of the members of tha association
to-dayâ 21S4 for to 219 asainst. What 19
believed to have been, a crisis la affairs
of the Prune Growers' Organization is
now passed, and it is thought the great
crop of prunes on hand will now be dis
posed of.
The called meeting of the Cured Fruit
Association to-day had attractetd the at
tention of the prune men in all parts of
the State, and those outside the county
had sent in their ballots by mail. Two
thousand of these had been received.
When the meeting was called to order
about 800 growers were present, probably
fifty of these from outside thÂ» county
Acting President H. \V. Meek of Ala
meda County presided, Alfnsd Barstow
secretary. Most all the directors wera
present. Mr. Meek read the call for tha
meeting, and stated the objects of tho
amendments. *
The previous meetings of the fruit
growers held had practically decided tha
action of to-day's meeting. Santa Clara
Valley members had almost unanimously
favored granting the directors the power
asked for to expend money In advertising
and pushing the sale of prunes. The mail
ballots were all sealed, and some littla
fear was felt as to their contents.
W. W. Dunne was the first speaker.
While he did not sanction the whole policy
of the officials of the association hÂ© urged

JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 20. -The Boers
IT was learned yesterday that before
President Hays of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad left for the East he
received a delegation of the Poke
gama Sugar Pine Lumber Company
of Klamathon, Cal., and gave that body
every assurance of his support In the com
pany's effort to build a road from Kla
rnathon to the Klamath Lakes.
Work on this road has been commenced.
It will extend from the north side of the
Klamath River, commencing at Kla
mathon, fourteen miles in an easterly di
rection into a dense forest. The road will
be in the heart of a splendid timber dis
trict in which the stockholders have In
sight more than 900,000,000 feet of lumber.
It is the intention of the new railroad
company to push its road direct to the
Klamath Laxes, own its steamers on
this bod;- of water and In this way ship
logs to its lumber mills at Klamathon at
a minimum cost.
The company also intends later on ex
tending the road Into the Lost River coun
try in the State of Oregon, which, though
rich in timber and pasture lands, at pres
ent is not penetrated by any railroad.
With the completion of the railroad into
these timber lands the Pokegama
Sugar Pine Lumber Company will be
greatly benefited. At present its. only
means of transporting logs from its mills
is by rolling them Into the Klamath River

If he be removed from office his pay shal

"I have made search for other ordinances
extending the power of the board to punish, but
have found none such. And It sÂ»ems to me that
the only fair conclusion that can be drawn Is
that it was the purpose of Â¦ the State Legisla
ture and of the Board of Supervisors to so limit
the powers of the Police Commissioners that an
accused officer should either be acquitted, sus
pended or removed. The power to degrade waa
not expressly given, and if there is any author
ity for implvlngr such power I have not found
it. In my opinion, the former Board of Police
Commissioners dldwiot have the power to im
pose the penalty of dlsratement upon any of
ficer."
"The court concurs in the foregoing
opinion," continues Judge Hebbard. "Un
doubtedly the board has power to punish
a police officer for cause, but It has no
power to fine, suspend, remove or disrate
him without charges preferred, without
trial and without cause. Let the writ is
sue." Â¦ '- Â¦ â¢
- The effort to secure the removal of
Lieutenant Price from charge of the
Chinatown squad was commenced in the
early, part of IStf. Price during the latter
part of- 1Â»98 and the early part of the fol
lowing year had been very successful In
closing up the Chinese gambling places.
So frequent and so effectual were his
raids that the gamblers and lottery men
decided that some means should be taken
for common delense.
A meeting was called early in January
of that year at a lottory place on Com
mercial street, near Dupont. which was
attended by leading Chinamen. It was de
cided to ask the keepers of the houses of
ill-fame and opium joints to unite in the
movement. This was agreeable, and the
effort to get rid of Price was commenced.
None of the Chinese concerned ever ac
cused Price of receiving any of the de
fense or corruption fund. The words of
the spokesman at the meeting were sub
stantially as follows:
"Price too hard on us. He keep ua mov
ing all the time. Cost too much money.
Esola all right; he smash door or so
catch few men, pay small fine; come back
next day and run game all the same.
Some time give officer few dollars. Ail
right, no bother. We like pet Esola back."
Only one witness was ever called before
the Police Commissioners to testify for or
against Price, although a written report
was made by a stool-pigeon In the emplov
of the police. So slight was the showing
made against the officer charged that In
stead of dismissing him a reduction In
rank was the only penalty Inflicted, the
board being equally divided on the propo
sition. Gunst and Tooln voted for Price's
dismissal, while Alvord and Lees voted
against it. In order to prevent a dead
lock the latter consented to the reduction
In rank.

a success. Frequently the logs accumu
late and cause a jam. Logs also drift to
the sides of the bank and eventually land
high and dry. With the new road the
logs will be easily loaded on flatcare and
hauled to the mills.
A prominent Southern Pacific Railroad
official stated yesterday that he deemed
the commencement of work on this road
the first steps toward a substantial rail->
road.
"This road when completed as far as
the Klamath Lakes will be valuable prop
erty," he said. "After reaching the lakes
connections can be very easily made with

WILLIAM PRICE has won his
fight for reinstatement to the
office of lieutenant of police.
A writ of mandate was issued
yesterday morning by Judge
J. C. B. Hebbard peremptorily command-
Ing the Board of Police Commissioners to
revoke the order of its predecessor, issued
April 19, 1S?3. disrating Lieutenant Price
and conferring upon him the title of ser
geant of police with its corresponding re
duction of power and salary. The board
Is also directed to reinstate Price to his
former rank of lieutenant of police.
Lieutenant Price, who was denied the
right to defend himself before the board,
opened his fight for reinstatement Im
mediately after the decision of the board
disrating him was announced. The hear
ing of the charges against him recalled
the days of the Inquisition, and justice
was denied him. Though apparently will
ing to reinstate Price, the present board
doubted Its power and suggested that he
take his case to the courts for adjudica
tion. He followed the suggestion and has
won his fight.
Judge Hebbard, after reviewing the law
governing the Police Commission and fix
ing Its power, says:
Price wis appointed patrolman on May 21,
3S7S: in September. 1SS3, he was promote*] ser
fc^ant: in May, 1S5', he was promoted .lieuten
ant. In whl'.-h position he served until April 19,

lice Commissioners, disrated, or reduced to the
inferior rank cf sergeant.
On July 12. 1S33. he wan retired on sergeant's
pension. On June 25. 1900. he was recalled to
active duty, and since then has been Â»erving
under the title of sergeant of police. Peti
tioner now asks the court to Issue its writ
of mandate directed to the defendants, the

them to set aside the order of April 19, 1S39.

state him to h'.s rank of lieutenant of police.
1'rior to the action of the former board disrat
ing petitioner he had no notice of any charges
being preferred against him. nor was he al

Lieutenant Price was not acquitted by the.
board, ncr was he found guilty and suspended
or removed from the force, but he was arbi
trarily disrated, reduced from the rank of lieu
tenant to the. rank of eensreajit: and. despite his
continual protest and frequent request to the
board for reinstatement, since that time he has

PORT ELIZABETH, Feb. 21.â The fol
lowing proclamation has been Issued by
President Steyn and General Dewet:
Be It known to all men the war which has
been forced on the Transvaal republics by the
British Government still rages over South
Africa; that all the customs oÂ£ civilized war
fare and also the conventions of Geneva and
The Hague are not observed by the enemy,
who have not scrupled, contrary to the Ge
neva convention, to capture doctors and am
bulances and deport them in order to prevent
our wounded . from getting medical assistance;
that they have seized ambulance material
appertaining thereto; that they have not hesi
tated to have recourse to primitive rules of
warfare, contrary to the solemn agreement of
The Hague, to arrest neutrals and deport
them and to send out marauding bands to
plunder, burn and damage burghers' private
property; that they have armed Kaffirs and
natives and used them against us in the war:
that they have been continually capturing
women and children and old and sickly men
and that there have been many deaths among
the women because the so-called Christian
enemy had no consideration for women on a
sick bed or those whose state of health should
have protected them against rough treatment.
Honorable women and tender children have |
not only been treated roughly, but have been
Insulted by soldiers, by order of their ofll
cers. Moreover, old mothers and women have
been raped, even wives and children, and the
property of prisoners of war, even of killed
burghers, has not been respected. In many
Instances the mother and father have been
taken, the houses left unprotected and all
have been left to their fate, an easy prey to
ravages.
The world has been untruthfully Informed by
the enemy that they have been obliged to carry
out this destruction because the burghers blow
up the railroad lines, cut the wires and mis
* use the white (Ins. Nearly all the houses in
the republics have been destroyed, whether in
the neighborhood of the railroad or not. The
alleged misuse of the white flag 1b simply a
continuance of the everlasting calumny against
which the Afrikander has had to strive since
the time. God brought him in contact with the
Englishman. Robbing his opponent of goods
only does not eatlpfy him; he is not satisfied
until he has robbed him of his good name also.
They state to the world that tha republic*
are conquered and that only here and there
small plundering bands are continuing the
strife In an Irresponsible manner. This Is an
untruth. The republics are not conquered. The
war Is not finished. The burgher forces of the
two republics are still led by responsible lead
ers, as from the commencement of the war,
under the supervision of the Governments of
both republics. The fact of Lord Roberts* and
Ix>rd Kitchener's choosing the term "maraud
ers" in designating the burghers does not make
them such.
When was the war over? Perhaps after the
battles in which Irregulars captured the enemy
and totally vanquished them.
The burghers would be less than men If thry
allowed the enemy to go unpunished after Ill
treating their wives and destroying their houses
from sheer lust of destruction. Therefore a
portion of the burghers resent It. Cape Colony
will not only wnge war but will be In a pposl
tlon to take reprisals, as It has already dent".
In the case of ambulances, therefore, we warn
the officers of his Majesty's troops that unless
they cease the destruction of the property of
the republics we shall wreak vengeance by
destroying the property of his Majesty's sub- '
Jects who are unkindly disposed. But. In order
to avoid being misunderstood, we hereby openly
declare that their wives and children will al
ways be unmolested, in spite of anything done
to ours by his Majesty's troops. We request
nothing from our brothers in the colony, but
call on them,, as. well an on the civilized world,
to assist. In behalf of our joint civilization and
Christianity, in putting an end to the barbarous
manner of the enemy's warfare.
Our prayer will always be that God. our
Father, will not desert us In this unrighteous
strife. 'â¢ STEYN AND DEWET.

WHEN Cloverdale opens her annual citrus fair
we know springtime is at hand. We know,
furthermore, that all through the winter sea
son, which in the East is marked by snow and ice, the
flowers have been blooming in our valleys and the
orange trees have been ripening their golden fruit.
We are made aware the time has come for festivals'
and rejoicing, and for profiting by the generosity of
our sun and soil. ~*- ,
It goes without saying that the Cloverdale fair of
this year is better, than ever before. Such things al
ways improve as the managers acquire more skill in
directing them and the support given by the public
increases. Thus the Cloverdale exhibit grows in size
and in importance, and, moreover, is in each succeed
ing year displayed with greater artistic taste.
The season' is propitious, for the abundant rain3
give promise of a golden summer. All parts of Cali
fornia are bright in the prospects of prosperity! It is
probable we shall have record-breaking crops of all
kinds this year and that our one trouble will be that
of finding a profitable market for them.
The improved facilities of transportation have
brought the tropics close to the great markets of the
civilized world. The New York papers note that
strawberries and early fruits have been offered for
sale in that city for nearly a month past. The fruits
have been brought from Southern Florida, from the
Bahamas, from the West Indies and even from Cen
tral America. California, of course, has also been a
contributor to the market, and thus the supply has
been so ample that nearlj' all classes can afford them
As the New York Tribune recently said: "In the ice
bound weeks of the year the people generally, even
those of modest means, have been able to buy many

THE REINSTATEMENT OF PRICE.
BY Judge Hebbard's decision that the Police
Commission had no authority to disrate Police
- Ofncer Price justice, though long delayed, has
at last been dose. In his decision the Judge said:
"Undoubtedly the board has authority to punish 3
police ofncer, but it has no power to fine, suspend,
remove or disrate him without charges preferred,
without trial and without cause."
The decision will be received by the public with
general gratification. The manner in which the Com
missioners treated Price constituted something in the
nature of a cross outrage. As Judge Ilebbard has
said: "Prior to the action of the former board dis
rating him Price had no notice of any charges having
been preferred against him, nor was he allowed any
hearing before the board. He was not acquitted by
that board nor was he found guilty and suspended or
removed from the force, but he was arbitrarily dis
rated â reduced from the rank of lieutenant â and, de
spite his continued protest and frequent request to
the board for reinstatement, since that time he has
been refused the relief he now seeks."
The action of the Police Commissioners in dis
rating Price in the manner described by Judge Heb
bard was bad in itself, but the scandal was deepened
and darkened by the testimony given in the recent
legislative investigation by Chan Chung, to the effect
that while Price was serving in Chinatown the sum
of $10,000 was raised by the highbinders for the pur
pose cf having him removed because he was active
in breaking up gambling dens. When* Chung was
asked who received the money he said: "I won't say
a word about it. If you look up the records and see
who tried to hurt Sergeant Price you will not make
any mistake. You will not be far from the men who
Cot the money."
Such is the record of the case. Judge Hebbard's
decision does justice so far as it lay in the power of
the court to do it, but a full justice will not be satis
fied until the conspirators, who wronged Price and
took a reward from the highbinders are disclosed, con.
victed and punished.

RACING flND GAMBLING.
*Tp HE track gamblers take advantage of the con
| fusion in the public mind and continually speak
* of grxmbling and racing as if they were one and
inseparable. But this is not so. Every racetrack in
California can be open to-day, and horses can try
speed, and people can go and bet on their judgment
of the speed and bottom of the animals, and no one
will interfere.
If the tracks were managed in that way no harm
would be done. A man who wished to bet on a horse
would have to hunt in the crowd for some one to take
him up, and there would be but few bets, and they
â¢would be made by men who could afford the pleasure
of backing their judgment, even at the risk of loss.
But that racing is not to the taste and does not
serve the purpose of the track gamblers who make
books and sell pools.
The crowd would pay at the gate, not for the privi
lege of gambling on the inside, but for the pleasure
of the sport ar.d the social association it affords. Such
racing stimulates the love of horses, the enterprise oi
breeders, and gives the public pleasure, without rob
bing anybody, or causing confidential clerks to de
spoil their employers, sons to disgrace their fathers
and husbands to degrade their wives.
Under their system of gambling the loss of money
is rcade easy. Bets Â«:re not made and taken openly
to back an honest judgment or an enthusiastic fancy.
If they were, not one in a thousand of the losers would
ever risk a cent. In bet, the track would have no in
terest for them at all. They care nothing about
l:or?es except as a means of gambling, and in a ma
jority of cases the means of losing their own money
or that they have stolen from some one else.
When Mayor Phelan speaks of a season of racing
to furnish dissipation for the people he does not mean
racing at all. That can be at any season or all sea
sons. What he means is an open season for racetrack
gambling, which cannot be at all unless his Super
visors say so. That form of gambling is worse than
faro and the percentage games which are forbidden
everywhere and at all seasons by the law of the State.
To talk sbout an open season for it is preposterous.
Whenever it is in action crime is increased. Employers
lofe money, men lose their honor, the community
loses reputation, not by racing, not by legitimate bet
ting, but by this most pernicious of all forms of gam
bling.
It is that which the pulpit denounces â not the run
ning, trotting or pacing of horses.
Why are certain Supervisors and the Mayor so per
sistent in their efforts to permit that special fo-m of
gambling and means of destruction and cause of
crime? Their constant renewal of the issue is most
surprising. They have been elected to be in a certain
sense the defenders of the character, honor and moral
ity of the community, as far as these can be helped
by official action and oversight. Yet they furtively
watch to catch public vigilance napping in order to
give freedom to this vice.
The people are getting tired of it, and will be re
lieved when the present government goes out of
power and they have a chance to replace it with one
which they will not have to sit up nights to watch.
7"" HE Philippine Commission has made a report
which does not come up to the expectations of
people who have been longer in the islands than
the commission and by reason of military service and
opportunity for observation have a fairly full knowl
edge of the situation.
The myth around which the commission builds it*
conclusions is the assumed friendship of a majority of
the people. There is no assurance that any respectable
minority of the natives are friendly to American rule.
There are reasons for this in the very administration
of affairs there. Mr. John Bass of the New York
Herald says: "Taxes are higher in Manila than un
der Spanish rule, and the inhabitants bitterly com
plain. Living expenses have doubled." A member
of {he Thirtieth Regiment, in a letter printed in the
Chicago Record, says: "The niggers are getting gay
and would not pay their taxes, so at the point of the
gun we made them shut up shop, and not open to sell
a thing to natives or soldiers. They made a big kick,
but it did them no good. We've got lots of ammu
nition, and our orders are to kill every one of them
at sight, men, women or children. We take no pris
oners. It is too much trouble to guard them."
It is no wonder that after much experience General
MacArthur says: "When I first started in against
these rebels I believed that Aguinaldo's troops rep
resented only a faction; I did not like to believe
that the whole populationâ the native population, that
is â was opposed to us and our offers of good gov
ernment. But, after having come this far, after hav
ing occupied many towns and cities in succession and
having been brought much in contact with both in
surrectos and amigos, I have been reluctantly com
pelled to believe that the Filipino masses are loyal and
devoted to Aguinaldo."
The commission in its report commends the tem
perance of the natives and casts a curious sidelight
on our presence among them. It says: "The selling
of native wines to soldiers of the United States is
strictly prohibited, because the soldiers are inclined
to indulge in those injurious beverages to" excess,
with disastrous results. The Filipino uses them mod
erately, if at all. Fortunately he docs not to any ex
tent frequent the American saloon. With a view to
preventing his being attracted there the playing of
musical instruments or the operation of any gambling
device, phonograph, slot machi.ne, billiard or pool
table, or other form of amusement in'saloons, bars or
drinking places is prohibited."
We take it for granted that no member of the com
mission saw the grim humor of this. But it is there.
The idea that the natives, for the sake of their morals,
must be protected from contact with the people who
are introducing good government and a higher civili
zation among them is simply exquisite. The com
mission should be more sober in the discharge of its
duties. It was not sent out there to contribute to thj
gayety of nations.
Mr. Williams, a very conscientious American cor
respondent, writes that he is appalled by the "profan
ity, obscenity,,licentiousness and drunkenness which
abound in the contact of the troops with the na
tives," and he recommends that hereafter no man be
enlisted for that service who cannot give testimonials
of good moral character!
Against this background ofgrewsome wit and hu
mor the commission throws out a feeler of Ameri
can public sentiment in a tentative proppsition that
"it would avoid some very troublesome agrarian dis
turbances between the Spanish friars and their ten
ants if the insular government could buy the ha
ciendas of the friars and sell them out to the present
tenants." Â»
Here is the entering wedge of a proposition that,
haviiig paid twenty millions for the islands to the
civil Government of Spain, we shall buy them again,
for a sum probably twice as large, of the ecclesiastical
corporations which own all the land.
The reference to the "insular government" is mis
leading. There is no such government. There is es
tablished there a temporary rule of order, but there
h no government. To begin paying money for all the
land in the islands, without examination of the titles,
is repugnant to American common sense. The com
mission puts stress upon title by prescriptive right.
But prescriptive right does not fuse into title when
the adverse party is held under duress. This was prac
tically the case in the islands.
It is the great cause of the strife there. The peo
ple were held in bondage while their lands were taken
from them, and Americans will hesitate about paying
for a title which represents no investment, that never
cost its holders a penny. It is better to leave things
as they arc than attempt such a solution.

have been obtained for the tables of the rich in the
winter months a quarter of a century ago."
With such competition it is of course important for
us to obtain better and cheaper means of getting our
produce to the market. We must also learn how to
pack our fruit in the most attractive manner, so that
it will command the best price. Those needs will be
a stimulus toward co-operation and toward the ad
vancement of the fruit industry. In the near x future
we shall have to <juit shipping so much raw fruit and
begin to manufacture the product of our orchards
into the finest of jellies and fruit conserves. That will
bring about a diversified fruit industry and in the end
prove much more profitable for us than the present
system.
With such products as are now displayed at the
Cloverdale fair there is no reason why Californian
fruit-growers should be dismayed by any competition,
and it is to be borne in mind the display there repre
sents but one of the citrus-growing sections of the
State. It would be gratifying if the fame of this fair
could be spread over ihe whole country in order that
Eastern people might know more of the manifold ad
vantages of California. For that reason the fair. merits
a generous support not only from the people of So
noma and the surrounding counties but from thoÂ«c
of all parts of the State. It has now been established
as one of the annual festivals and industrial exhibitions
of California, and is maintained upon a scale that de
serves a liberal patronage.

It will be interesting to learn the vle-w

forcible seizure of the Tientsin salt heaps
by the two Consuls representing: those

Is stated, to the Chinese merchants of lY.m

Tientsin by the allied troops the French
and Russian Consuls raised their respec
tive flags over the property, and now re
fuse to' deliver it back to the rightful
owners save upon payment of three-quar
ters of Its market value, which amount*
to demanding a "ransom" of $5,000,000.

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
THE DE0TH OF SENATOR WHITE.
THE death of a man who has. been the people's
free choice for a high preferment is always an
event in a free society that fixes, for more than
a moment, the attention of men upon the frail and
fleeting nature of this life and its honors and ac
tivities.
Where any high estate well won is won by merit
only there is always in the winner's life material for
study and for example. As this is true of the average
public man, it is impressively true of our late Senator
White, who is dead untimely in the first month of his
forty-ninth year.
He was a native of San Francisco, and was reared
on a farm in Santa Cruz County, where he underwent
all of those hardy experiences that go to make a man.
His family in Ireland was of the landed gentry, and
he came fairly by the persistence with which he
wrought upon the" soil for his start in life. In his
blood there was a literary strain, and among his kin
was one of the leading pastoral writers of Ireland.
In his father's house frugality was a necessity, and
so the future Senator and leader of men felt all of
the fireside sacrifice that went into his education, and
it is recorded of him that while in college and read
ing for the bar he eschewed not only dissipation, but
even social relaxation and amusement. When he
needed rest and recuperation from absorbing study he
found it back on the farm at the old tasks, less a tax
on his family than a helper.
By the happily joined force of his vigorous physical
and mental constitution he had finished his profes
sional studies and was admitted to the bar at the age
of twenty-one.
That was in 1874. The California of that year is no
more. Then Los Angeles was an old but undeveloped
region, and the 3'oung lawyer, with a vision that com
prehended the future, selected that city as the field # in
which to begin his professional career. His success
was immediate. So rapidly did he win his way that
had Southern California not felt the thrill of enter
prise and been moved to cast behind her the slow
ways of old, to develop equally with his growing
energies and expanding genius, he would have been
compelled to seek another field. But he remained
through the years, and in the midst of that rising ex
pression of prosperity and adventure which gave to
his increasing powers a steadily widening field.
The people appreciated him as a leading factor in a
development that became the marvel of the country-
Their favor was shown in public preferment. From
four years in the office of District Attorney he passed
to four years in the State Senate, half of that time
serving as Lieutenant Governor. After a return of
three years' duration to private life he was elected
Senator of the United States.
It was the most conspicuous personal victor}' in the
history of California politics. The strongest political
influences and the wealth of his party were against
him. But, making the high and memorable declara
tion, "I intend to make it possible for a poor man to
aspire to the Senatorship on his merits alone," he
overcame the forces laised up against him, and on
his fortieth birthday was elected Senator.
In his speech accepting the office at the hands of
the joint convention of the Legislature he declared
that in the early days of his strife and trials, long be
fore he reached man's estate, he had determined to
equip himself for the duties of a Senator, expecting
some time to achieve that station. What that meant
the State and the nation soon knew.
Many American worthies have been Senators.
Some, have closed their career in that chamber and
some have gone further and higher. But none ever
entered it with a more thorough preparation for its
duties, nor a more exalted conception of them. Dur
ing his term he was subjected to every form of test
and sustained himself in all with conspicuous honor to
his State. In the discussion of economics, of public anl
international law, of national policy and ideals, he de
veloped no limitations. Hailed by his partisans as
chief, his opponents were scarcely less enthusiastic in
their acknowledgment of his rare powers.
But at last the b'irden grew greater than the
strength that sustained it. His exacting and con
scientious attention to every detail of his position, and
the necessities of his law practice, which were al
ways upon him, proved too much, and at the end of
his term, his strength was impaired beyond recovery.
The charm and power of his mind were in their prime,
but his physical strength had passed it, and no
regimen could bring back the declining vigor.
The impression he leaves upon his native State is
permanent. In Congress he was contemporary with
his two cousins, Hon. W. Bourke Cockran of New
York and Senator Mallory of Florida. It is not often
that three as brilliant men, holding the same degree of
kinship, are found in concurrent service. But, with
out injustice to his brilliant kin, it may be fairly
claimed that the Californian was the greatest of the
three. His oratory had those graces which arise in
the quality of imagination, and was of enchanting
form. As a lawyer he was a master of statement, and
a master, too, of the great principles of that science,
and so was not a slave to precedents and cases. He
made precedents for others.
The State may well .mourn her dead. The greatest
of her sons has gone away in his youth, and the place
he leaves none may fill.
Pantaloons of a Century Ago.
While stockings were a largely visible
portion of dress they were often of silk,
and objects of care and pride. "With the
short pantaloons striped yarn stockings
of the French mode were worn. The new
trousers went through many mutations of
cut and shape-r-sometimes closely fitted
and called tights, sometimes baggy. Then
thoy were funnel-shaped at the ankle,
then tight at the ankle only. They were
plaited at the waist and side into an
absurd fullness, and even ' had tucks
around the bottom. An old chronicler
tells of his first dre.Â«s pantaloons: "The
pantaloons, over which I wore boots, were
of, non-elastic corduroy. It would be un
just to the tailor to say that they fitted
like my skin, for they sat a great deal
closer. "When I took thorn off my legs
wore like fluted pillars grooved with the
cords of the pantaloons*.!' The coat worn
with these fluting machines had long,
narrow tails which were twice as long as
the waist portion. The collar was a huge
roll reaching to the ears. There were
two rows each of nineteen brilliant but
tons. The coat was named "Jean de
Bry," for a French statesman. Morning
and evening coats were shaped exactly
alike till 1830, when a frock coat was
evolved. Overcoats had fur collars, full
skirts and very tight bodies. In 1832
many men wore a picturesque Polish
cloak with double cape.
The change from knee breeches *to trou
sers met stern opposition, and In full dress
assemblies in polite society knee breeches
were worn for some years after trousers
were everywhere seen on the streets. To
enforce this regulation the somewhat
startling notice was placed upon the en
trance to an assembly hall: "Gentlemen
will not be permitted to dance without
breeches." In 1S14 the Duke of Wellington
presented himself at the door of the ball
room at Almack's, and his entrance was
barred by an official, who said: "Your
Grace cannot be admitted in trousers "
The Duke being thus attired quietly left
the building.
A few ojd fellows in America, chiefly old
Federalists, clung long to the ancient
style of dress. President Madison wore
knee breeches and buckles and powdered
his hair and cue till his death, in 1S36.
Some solid men of Boston wore them till
that date. Governor Eustis among the
number. Dr. Robbinn and Governor Ter
ry of Hartford did also. President Monroe
was known as "The Last Cocked Hat."
Invention of "Righis" and "Lefts."
The year 1S0O saw the invention and in
troduction of rights and lefts in shoes by
In these pictures of life a century ago I
shall speak of various domestic phases of
every-day society, not giving all the
minute details of that existence nor ana
lyzing the influences that caused social
conditions, but simply telling of matters
just as they really were and were seen by
folk of that day in their constant round
of life. At the head of the household was
the goodman, and before he can speak to
us or ere we can learn aught about his
thoughts or modes of life in the natural
course of events we note his clothes. Let
us not underrate their influence on his
life. Carlyle says: "Man's earthly Inter
ests are all hooked and buttoned together
and held up by clothes."
They plainly indicate historical tfends
and events. The dress of an American cit
izen in January, 1S01, was an Anglicized
copy of the garb, of a French citizen. The
opening acts of the French revolution had
been celebrated with sympathetic interest
in many American cities as well as In
Paris. An open-air feast of a roasted ox
held in Boston in January needed both
the great bonfire and ample hogsheads of
punch to "cast a pleasing luster o'er the
festive scene." A "frenzy," to use Presi
dent Jefferson's favorite expression, set
in for the French. The American patriots
who took part in the outdoor feast called
themselves Citizen This or That. Mar
riages were announced in American nev\ 3
papers between Citizen Brown and te | a
Smith. Americans had their , heads
dressed by tho French barber La v Igne a
la Brutus," or "a la Titus," which was an
ugly cropped shock, "like a frightened
owl," looking rude enough after B r ?at
stately wigs and hair in powder and rib
bon. Another style of haircutting seen on
young American pates was "en orellles oe
chien," such aa was worn by General
Bonaparte at the time of the Italian cam
paign; the hair "banged" at the eyebrows
straight across and left long at the sides
to cover the ears. All men were smooth
shaven.
Revolution in Men's Garments.
In every detail of men's dress were radi
cal changes in the year 1801, perhaps the
most marked and sudden transitions
men's dress had ever known. In this
transition the greatest Item of alteration
was from breeches to trousers. As early
as 1785 the leaving off of knee buckles and
lengthening of kneo breeches was the
advance note of this change. ine
breeches were buttoned below the knee or
tied with strings and soon were called
pantaloons. Hessian boots met the pan
taloons at the calf, and soon long trous
ers were In "Immense taste" and the un
manly shoestring" was In vogue to the
dismay of the buckle makers. By 1801
the satin and velvet coats of Washing
ton's court; the cocked hats and silk
stockings and knee buckles had gone with
tho knee breeches and given place to
pinched coats, great neckerchiefs and
clumsy beaver hats. In 1S01 young
dandles of the democratic party dis
played their Jeffersonlan simplicity by
going in their own cropped hair, without
wigs or pigtails. *
Jefferson made himself specially obnox
ious to conservative folks by giving up
shoe buckles. He "dressed in his suit of
customary black, with shoes that laced
tight round the ankle and closed with a
neat leathern string.".

Men also wore surtouts and roquelaures
and great capes, as we learn from the ad
vertisements of lost articles. The scarlet
cape, such as Samuel Adams took to
Washington, was out of date.
Garments for Students and Children.
A variation of dress was seen in Boston
in the uniform of the Harvard students,
which had frogs and cords of black on an
ordinary coat. This uniform was adopted
to "spot" the undergraduates at the the
ater, which they were forbidden to at
tend, or anywhere else where they snouia
not be. They nad to wear the coat sum
mer and winter. Commencement then was
in August. A plaid cloak was the favored
overcoat. In their rooms the undergrad
i:ates wore loose jackets and gowns or
gayly figured calico or baize. Merchants
and even professional men wore In their
offices and counting rooms loose wadaeu
dressing gowns, known as night gowns or
banians. In the eighteenth century these
were of magnificent stuffs and brocades,
and many of Copley's Bitters are painted
ir: them.
For many centuries the dress of young
boys T%as precisely like that of their fath
ers. As soon as they put off the petticoats
of tho infant they wore truly manly gar
ments. These gave a quaint and serious
look to all old-time portraits of children.
The teachings of Rousseau brought about
a distinctive boys' garb in France, and it
is said that Marie Antoinette was one of
the first to dress her son, the little dau
phin, in round jacket and trousers, in
stead of the formal knee breeches and
brocaded coat and .waistcoat little boys
had hitherto worn. Old portraits and the

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Wheat Vessels in Demand.
All wheat and barley found In the ware
houses on March 1 will be taxed, and in
consequence there has been a scurry
among the grain dealers to get their
wares afloat before that date. The un
loading of chartered vessels has been
rushed and every available carrier in port
has been pressed into service. The last
one taken was ihe big British ship Dltton.
She is 2699 tons net and will caxry about
D000 tons of grain. The charterer had to
advance the rates in order to pet her, and
SSs 9d was paid for the vessel.
The Edmund, that went ashore at Santa
Rosalia and which Is now in port, has
played In hard luck. She was chartered
at 47s 6d to lead wheat at Portland, but
in consequence of her mishap the charter
has been canceled.
Water Front Notes.
One of the Bryant and Brqnnan street
cars was wrecked at the corner of East
and Folsom streets yesterday. A wagon,
laden with grain was rounding the corner
when one of the wheels caught in the car
track and threw the wagon over against
the car. Every pane of glass in the car
was broken, the step was torn away and
the body of the car damaged. The wagon
ras not hurt.
The transport Sherman went to the
I'nion Iron Works yesterday. She is to
have new decks put in and the deck
houses remodeled. It will take about three
months to do the work. . '
There was a small fire at 210*4 Spear
Ftreet yesterday. Grace & Co. have a lot
of saltpeter piled up in their warehouse
and behind it there was a pile of sacks.
The sacks caught fire, but the blaze was
put out before much damage was done.
The steam schooner Brunswick and the
steamship Xome City left Eureka to
gether last Wednesday morning. The
former is bound for San Pedro and the
latter for San Diego. Beth had passen
gers for San Francisco and put in here
to land them. The Brunswick beat her
rival bv an hour, making the run In twen
ty-four hours. She docked at Powell
street, landed her passengers and was on
her way out again when the Nome City
was coming in. The latter vessel lost no
time, however, and the Brunswick's
smoke could still be seen when the Nome
City was in chase. San iedro is ninety
miles farther south than San Diego, but
the captain of the Brunswick says he will
make port about the same hour as the
Nome City.
Â»
Will Search for the Missing Ship.
The revenue cutter HcCulloch is coaled
and ready to sail this morning in search
of the German ship Otto Gildermeister.
Captain Coulson says, however, that if it
is thick and hazy outside he will not go
to eea, as it would be like searching for
a needle in a bundle of hay to try to find
the Gildermpister in a fog. The general
opinion among shipping men is that the
captain of the Gildermeister stood off
shore ivlien the gale came up three days
ago, and that he is now working his way
back to San Francisco.
HAVING A TEST OF SPEED.
T|â~^ XC1TEMENT was created on the
ni^ big battleship Wisconsin about 9
o'clock Wednesday night. The
.Aâ =-^ Wisconsin is moored to a buoy
about half a mile from the Union
Iron Works and it is expected that she
will go into commission within a day or
two. Shortly after the lights went out
the sentry heard two cries of distress
from tne water. He notified the officer
of the deck and in a few minutes a boat
was lowered and manned. Tho cries came
from three men in the water, and it was
not long before two of them were picked
up. The rescued men turned out to be
deserters from the Wisconsin. They said
that in company with a "landsman"
named J. Anderson they had slipped over
the side and started to swim for the shore.
When a hundred yards away from .the
ship their courage gave out and as the
water was extremely cold and they were
afraid of cramps they yelled for help.
Anderson disappeared and his companions
seem to think he is drowned. The olflcers
of the ship do not share this belief, how
ever, and every shore party has instruc
tions to keep a keen lookout for the de
serter.
Deserters From Battleship Find Water of the Bay Too Cold
to Be Endured, and Fearing Death by Drowning Yell
Loudly for Help, Which Comes From Man-of-War
BELIEVE SHAY
IS INNOCENT
Officers Think That Limb
Knocked Him and Flint
From Their Horses.
Board of Officers Will Investigate
the Mysterious Affair â Hun
dreds of Recruits to
Arrive.
Everything points toward the release in
a very short time of Joseph Shay of. the
Sixth Cavalry, who is confined in the Pre
sidio guardhouse until the mysterious
death of his comrade, Frank Flint, is in
vestigated. Thus far tho officers have
been unable to discover any cause for tho
rumors of foul play, other than the fact
that Shay says he cannot tell how Flint's
death was caused.
The cavalrymen who have served with
Shay and Flint have no hesitancy in say-
Ing that the Idea of foul play is prepos
teious, on the ground that the friendship
existing between the men was of too
strong a nature. They, as expert horse
men, also say that for a man to be swept
or knocked from the back of a horse by
limbs of trees is not uncommon, particu
larly when the hourses are being ridden
at high speed. They believe a limb caused
the fall of Shay and Flint.
Major Rucker and Lieutenant Eltinge
have about concluded their investigations
and have decided that the death of the
unfortunate cavalryman was due to an
accident. A board of officers, however,
will be appointed, which will further in
vestigate the mysterious affair, and until
this board reports' Shay will be kept In
confinement.
The latter still sticks to his story of
not being able to give any explanation of
the strange affair. He is still badly
shaken up and talks incoherently at times,
but it Is believed that he Is telling the
truth.
The First Battalion of the Tenth In
fantry is expected here Sunday. It left
Newport News, Virginia, February 17.
Hundreds of recruits will arrive at- the
Presidl.o within the next few days. Word
T\as received yesterday that 7S0 had left
points in New York and Ohio for this
coast. They will be assigned to the Third
Provisional Battalion of infantry and the
First Provisional Squadron of cavalry.
When these two organizations are com
pleted the department will organize an
other battalion of. Infantry.
YUBA COUNTY WOMAN
KILLED BY OPERATION
T>r. Ernst A. Bohra Reports a Fatal
Case Which Will Be Investi
gated by the Coroner.
Dr. Ernst A. Bohm of SM Golden GatÂ©
avenue reported to Coroner Leland yester
day that Mary Ann Sevey, an unmarried
woman 23 years old, had died at 1312
Golden Gate avenue. According to the
story told by the doctor and Mrs. M. Weg
ner, the nurse in the case, Miss Sevey,
came from Yuba County to Mrs. Wegner's
house at 1312 Golden Gate avenue on Feb
ruary 9, and on February IS Dr. Bohm
was called In. An hour later he sent for
Dr. F. W. Harris of 933 Market street for
consultation. Dr. Eohm ! remained with
the sick woman until 3:35 yesterday morn-
Ing, at which hour the woman died.
An autopsy by Morgue Surgeon Luigi D.
Baclgalupl showed that death had been
caused by septic peritonitis following an
unlawful operation. Coroner Leland will
hold an Inquest and Will endeavor to
ascertain the identity of the guilty physi
cian.
When Robert E. Glaze shot down his
partner, William Trcv. hel'.a. In the kitchen
d the Windsor Hotel, it was said that a
shortage In his accounts existed and hlj
desire to keep the fact from hi3 partner
furnished a motive for his crime. This
theory has been proven erroneous.
A report was filed yesterday In Judge
Kerrigan's court by J. J. McCarthy, who
was appointed to expert the books and ac
counts of the co-partnership between
Glaze and Trewhella. "With the exception
of a few trivial clerical errors the books
were found to be correct ar.d contained no
evidence cf a ehort&ga cr manipulation
â¢n the part ct Glaxe to cover any of his
traneaetioss while conducting the busi
ness of the hotel.
McCarthy was appointed by Judge Ker
rigan to expert the hotel books at the re
quest of counsel la the action lnstltute-1
by Glaze and his wife against Trewhella's
trlflow and other interested parties for an
accounting of the affairs of the'buslness.
Jils report on the books and accounts
covens the period from April 25. 1900. when
Glaze and Trewhella took charge of the
hotel, to January 16 last, upon which date
the action for an accounting was insti
tuted.
McCarthy finds that 6lr.ee assuming the
toiaaagement of the hotel Glaze has drawn
1725 60 and Trewhella $19175. At the time
they entered Into the co-partnership they
exemited a chattel mortgage on the fur-
TilÂ»hlarÂ» of the hotel for $3000. upon which
J1000 has been paid, and thev also paid off
a claim for 5315 93 made bv J. M. Janes. A
full account of receipts and disbursements
was kept by Glaze and outside the fact
that during the period of the co-partner
ship he drew a few hundred dollars more
from the business than did Trewhella
there Is nothing to show that financial
troubles caused the killing of the last
jiaiaed.
This Disproves Correctness of State
cent That Financial Troubles-
Caused Killing of William
Trewhella.

ered an address last night before the San
Ffanclsco section of the Council of Jewish
Women on the matter of caring for do
pendent children. She strongly favors the
Michigan system of placing the waifs and
orphans with families, instead of sending
them to publlcMnstltutions supported by
State aid. During tho past year 5523 de
pendent children were cared for in Cali

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â Bradstreefs on Feb
ruary -23 will say: Trade as a whole has
shown further expansion this week, despit4
severe weather tending to check trade at some
Northern and Western markets In the face of
very unsatisfactory conditions In the cotton
manufacturing trade, brought about by dull
ness . in cotton goeds nt . first â¢ hands. The po
sition of retailers with large stocks has been
really improved by the continued cold weather.
Foremost among the lines noting Improvement
this week is the dry-goods : trade. The boot
and shoe industry has likewise continued In
satisfactory shape,- and some varieties of leath
er reflect recent activity in advances at East
ern markets. Iron and steel In the crude
forms have been very strong at. Central and
Eastern markets and considerable advances are
reported In piglron and steel .billets. Heavy
sales are reported â¢ from Plttsbury, Birming
ham and other markets. Bessemer plglron at
PittsburgMs now selling at $14 75.' the highest
price for months, while a premium of $1 50 a
ton is exacted on Immediate deliveries of steel
billets, although the official quotation of $19 73
still maintains. Finished products are reported
In good demand. Merchantable bars were : ad
vanced $2 a ton late last week, and 1.35c Is now
the minimum price for these goods. Structural
material Is reported active. In some respects
In fact the state of this trade as a whole is
the strongest since before the collapse last
spring. Export trade Is slack, foreign iron
and steel e.re steadily going lower, and the
fear of discriminating duties against American
Iron and steel is evident, although the first
manifestation, that ' In â¢ the case . of Russia, In
volves n. small amount of business. '
The. strength of building materials of all
kinds, particularly of white and â¢ yellow pine
and builders' hardware, -has. been notable, and
from many cities come the. report that a large
amount of building will â¢Â¦ be done " the coming
spring. Coffee, strengthened on better con
sumptive demand. .Tea has met with : better
sale, as the prospects for any Immediate
change In the present tariff by Congress be
comes less probable. Tin Is higher, in' sym
pathy with speculative activity abroad.
The cereals show little definite movement,
taking the week ; as a , whole, except . in flour,
.which Is 10 to 20 cents a barrel f higher. I Wheat
Is fractionally higher and corn unchanged.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for five days,
aggregate 4.424.302 bushels, against 4.814.S7S
bushels last week. > .. 'Â¦Â¦.
From July 1; to date this season wheat ex-
There was a very heavy business on ths

eugar gTOup were eastÂ«r. Makaweli sellint- off

In thÂ« afternoon tha sugar stocks were weak,

March 23.
The oil stocks were quiet on both exchanges
on the mornlns session. Hanford declined to
$107- and Occidental of West Virginia to 64c.
while Gold Dollar was higher at 50Â»-.
In the afternoon Hanford was still lower at

Not only did the activity of the stock mar
ket fall off this week, but reactionary tend
encies asserted themselves In the movement of
prices. Speculation was more professional than
had been the case In the preceding fortnight
and the traders, under the lead of some heavy
cperaltons, showed a willingness to act on the
short side. While the street received some
little knowledge of the form which the pending
amalgamation of steel manufacturing inter
efts is to take and was assured that the ne
gotiations are progressing smoothly, it was
nevertheless unsettled by the absence of defi
nite announcement In that connection and by
the Intimation that the financiers who had
the matter In charge were disposed to curtail
any chance for inflation In the capitalization
oÂ£ the expected tSOO.OOO.OOO steel company. At
the beginning of the week the steel stocks
were all very strong on the prospect that Mr.
Morgan would soon bring the negotiations to
a successful conclusion. The preferred stocks
of the steel industrial organizations were re
sponding with particular readiness to these
Influences when it was brought t<> the notice
r.f the street that however well the preferred
sl'ares of these organizations would be treated
trere- was a desire on the part of the managers
to make the terms regarding the exchange of
the old stocks for the new ones on a basis
which should have a regard for actual value
end earning capacity. This was interpreted
as meaning that a mistake made in the for
mation of many of the Industrials, in refer
ence to the creation of common stocks repre
senting a capitalization of possible profits,
â¢would be rectified as far as possible 'n thÂ»
organization of the new combination. This
augured ill as the treatment of the common
sleeks of the steel industrials, which were
at once sold and declined. while in somÂ»
ckses the preferred shares of the sams com
panies advanced further or held their previous
gains. The delay and the unsettling effects of
the above situation had, however, an adverse
influence on the temper of the market at
lnige. The railroad list had already given
evidence of being overbought and the absence
o." nny, further announcement of deals and
combinations deprived it of fresh support.
Money market conditions also contributed to
ward creating a reactionary feeling In specu
lative circles.

May Me higher at 76%Â®76%c. Liverpool and
Antwerp both lending encouragement In tho
shape of advances equal to the bulge here yes
terday. Reports of a brighter export outlook
were not substantiated, however, and this was
a factor In the closing decline. At the opening
offerings were light, and It took no great
amount of buying to send the market' from
76Hc. which it touched early, to 76Hc. Long
Wheat came out freely, and the market dropped
to 7S9ic. Covering because of the' holiday to
morrow caused a reaction to 75<gr76Hc. but re
newed pressure forced the market back to 75Hc.
and the close was easy with May USHc lower
at 75%c. - - .
There was a fairly active trade In Corn, and
the market for that cereal ruled strong. May
closed HiSiic higher at 40%Â®40%c.
Oats were steady and" fairly active. May
closed a ehade higher at 25?fcÂ®26Â«4c.
Provisions opened firm because of strength In
the Hog market and in sympathy with Wheat

NEW TOB.K. Feb. 21.â The sharp up-turn In
the steel stocks which gained force rapidly
toward the close of th? market was the only
thing that redeemed the market from unin
teresting dullness to-day. National Steel and
Tin Plate showed the most pronounced strength
in this recovery, the former rising OH over
last night and the latter 4 1 ,; from the early
low point. The .outstanding short interest,
which had prown quire large In the stocks of
the steel companies, had a large part In this
quick rally. The reoort that the so-called
Moore properties of the steel group were stand
ing out for a large 3hare In the securities In
the new company was an Influence In the rise,
the supposition of the speculators being that
they were likely to sret what they claimed.
But the other f.teel stocks were not much be
hind In the movement. Federal Steel rallying
3'i from the low price. Pteel and Wire 2% and
Tennessee Coal 3. Wh-ther the movements ac
curately forecast any actual development in
the steel merger combl-iatlons can only be told
when the results are given to the public. De
tails were closely regarded urf to the time of
the closing of the marUot. but It is the general
supposition that reorganization of the steel
company so far as it Is to have official an
nouncement will be given out before trading
is resumed on Monday. Actual information on
these details Is so vasrue that the shorts in
the steel stocks were overcome with timidity
and hastened to close their contracts before
the coming three holidays. The tame influ
ence was at work in ether parts of the list.
The early weakness of the market began to
change to recovery when support was manifest
In the steel stocks. The weakness was quite
acute fit one time, the steel stocks leading
the decline as they did the recovery. Many
of the prominent railroad stocks were down
between 1 and 2 points*, the grangers, Pacifies,
Southwesterns and some of the coalers being
conspicuous. BurllnKtor>. Kansas and Texas
preferred. Erie second preferred and Rock Isl
and were notably weak. These stocks were
all conspicuous In the rally also. A number
of the most important railroad stocks were
lifted a point above ?ast night. The continued
driving the shorts to cover, as It was expected
that there mlsht be a flurry in money in
cidental to the demand to carry over until
next Monday. The banks report gains of cash
from the interior sines last Friday and their
accounts with the sub-treasury about balance.

THK REVIEW FOR THE WEEK.
Prices of stocks have worked downward dur
ing the past week and speculative sentiment
has taken on a conservative tone. The dis
position has been general to lessen speculative
burdens as a precaution against any unfavor
able development in the situation. The con
tinued heavy inroad.-- making upon the money
market resources by the financial operations
incident to the recent railroad consolidations
and the fear that th-; financing of the steel
merger would strain the available resources of
the money market have been the underlying
causes of the reactionary tendency of prices.
The decision to close il-e Stock Exchange from
Thursday afternoon until Monday morning
added to the inclination of operators to close
up accounts, as the possibility of accident
during a prolonged interval in the trading Is
always taken account of. Only the less In
fluential element among the professional oper
ators have shown an apposition to the prevail
ing tendency of the market, and their oc
casional efforts to turn prices upward have not
met with success. The most potent Interests
In the financial world have made It clear that
they favored a quiet <?tock market for the
present. This they could accomplish not only
by discontinuing their recent heavy buying of
securities, but by meeting any attempt to ad
vance prices by free offerings. The decline has
not been precipitate ai any time and the bears
have not been bold or aggressive. Probably
this Is also In accord with the desires of the
large financial Interests who arc concerned' in j
perfecting the glgancic steel merger, as they I
have been In the most important recent rail
road consolidations. A demoralized stock mar
ket would Interfere: with i>ending financial pro
jects as much as unbridled speculation for
the rise. â¢ There are many signs to show that
the community of interest Idea has not lost
Its fascination for the speculative public. It
is highly probable that any new developments
In thWt field would attract a renewal of the
upwan movement of prices, but in the absence
of actual developments the opportunity for
consideration and appraisal of results achieved
by the recent combinations have somewhat j
chastening influences 3i\ the excess of specu
lation. Not a few of the rumors of railroad
combinations which have been started in the
ra^t for manipulative t.urpcsjs have been dis
credited by authoritative Â«cto\val*. thus help
ing on the week's reaction. The possibility
that thÂ» labor dispute would be reopened In I
the anthracite region v.-hen the present agree
ment expired In April was a factor. Signs of
pub'.ic disapproval of the groat centralization
of financial control which Is being accom
plished and the fear that it may lead to legis
lative interference has been . taken account of.
Home ,>f the bonds all'ected by the railroad
combinations have be._-ii heavily atSJrbed at
times, but the railroad bond market haa gen
erally been reactionary in sympathy with
stocks.

"Of course a turnlns point must sooner or
later arrive: -rvlien the s-tracture of speculative
value* must be subje'tr-d to normal tests. To
sn important extent thiis boom has taken for
granted the optimistic claims of the friends
and rromoters of the great consolidation move
ment. However much rocy be fairly conetvled
combinations can it tv- considered likely that
Wall street will give Us final Indorsement to
a scale rf values one-third above the former
rormal level? Is. ther<* any solid probability
that this clars of securities will retain a very
much advanced range .jf prices in the face of
a duplication of the volume of their paper
issues without any increase In their true cap
ital? It cannot be denied that, for the most
part, the pencir.s boom is a speculation based
upon nr> experimentâ an experiment which.
Rtnong r 'tn p r things, aims to accom
plish through water what hitherf) has been
procurable only throufli gold."
"It Is not to be denied that a situation so
calculated to excite th* optimistic spirit of
rpeoulation has never before existed In Wall
street: indeed, -we may not alone say Wall
street, far a like furor has dominated Lon
don in rpite of the many bearish factors that
are now rtralnir.g that center. From the
wholly fxtiaordinary Â«Ute of affairs presented
bj the nÂ»w condition* In politics, trade. In
dustry and finance we could expect from spec
ulation no other result than that which now
appears in a rise r,f cne-third in the market
value of nearly all corporate investments.
SCOT can we be Pure that this great enhance
ment of prices has v.-t reached its culmina
tion. Certain it is. lu.trever. that the point
has not yet been reacted at which the "bear*
has even ventured on a tentative test of the
Inherent mensth Of thÂ« market. The pessi
mists are lying low until a higher state of
tension in prices has S*-<Â»n reached, or are even
lendinjr their help as l.uyers to precipitate the
Ireaklng point ; for it If- again** their interest
that the public sh^uM become educated into
familiarity with this n*w srale of values.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The predominant sentiment s^ems to be that
the current remarkable run cf industrial de
velopment is forcing on the country an era of
ccncer.tratirn cf mammoth capitals, destined to
tdmlnlntw our largest material Interests. Men
of sjie^ulative l^nt <lo not wait to consider
con<5itior.5; to ther.i it is sufficient that a
movement of Fuch tireadth and prominence
en'l backed by the f?rcmost financiers and
capitalists of the country affords material for
a speculation of unprecedented breadth, activ
ity and expectancy. They vÂ«erceive that, from
Â¦th* extT.t of these operations, they must re-
Qufre time for their consummation and see at
least a possibility that ihe consolidation mov#
riifnt may ran on to lengths not at present
aefir.Itrly forpspf-n. Thus the general conclusion
is reached that a special basis Is established
for a fairly reasonable speculative probability
that the rrefnt boom will he kept up fcr
s^rne coTifl'lerabie timÂ«. â¢with a possibility of
even material ly higher prices for many stocks
than have >Pt bpÂ«n reached. Plainly th'.s is

GRAND HOTEI*
PEKING. Feb. 21.â Prince Ching and LÂ«
Hung Chang have received telegraphic in
structions from the court to notify the
Ministers of the powers that an edict has
been issued regarding the punishments of
Chinese officials confirmatory of the de
mands made by the Ministers as fol
lows:
General Tung Fuh Slang to be degraded
and deprived of his rank.
Prince Tuan and ,Duke Lan to be dis
graced and exiled.
Prince Chuang Ying- Nlen and Chao Shu
Chiao to commit suicide.
Hsu Chen Yu, Yu Hsien and Kl Hain
to be beheaded.
This? is not exactly what the Ministers
demanded, but it Is considered advisable
to agree to it, as the demand lor lives has
been agreed to, except in the case of Gen
eral Tung Fuh Slang, whom the court fs
powerless to moleet. There is a private
understanding that his life will be claimed
when It is possible.
The European and Chinese secretaries
of legations and others who have lived in
China for years consider that China has
gained a victory, as the only man ' the
court has to behead is Yu Hsien. Tho
other two are In the hands of the Jap
anese and could be beheaded when their
execution was wanted. Suicide is no dis
grace whatever in the eyes of the Chi
nese.
No one believes General Slang will ever

CLARK'S ROAD
IS A CERTAINTY
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â This was an
other field day In the House. Two dis
tinct sensations occurred. Early In the
day. during the consideration of an
amendment to the deficiency appropria
tion bill to prevent hazing at the Naval
Academy, Hepburn of Iowa used exceed
ingly strong language while Inveighing
against the practice of hazing, charging
by indirection that the habits of tyranny'
and oppression formed by the officers of
the army and navy at their academies
were responsible for the refusal of sailors
to enlist In the navy and for the large
number of desertions from the army.
Moreover, he alleged that the oKcers
stood by each other when In trouble. say-
Ing that the commanders of twenty-five
vessels of the navy lost since the civil
war had with one exception escaped with
slight punishment.
Cannon of Illinois and Dayton of West
Virginia warmly defended the navy.
The iÂ«t!r caused by Hepburn's speech.
however, was mild compared with the
row which was kicked up over some Items
In the bill for extra compensation for em
ployes of the House. Dln3more of Arkan
sas exposed the fact that one of the em
ployes of the House while occupying one
position \ras drawing salary for another,
and that the difference between the sala
ries was to bp made up In one of the
items in the bill.
This led to a general ventilation of the
domestic affairs of the House, during
which Bailey of Texas declared that the
situation was a scandal upon the integ
rity of the House. He charged that there
were employes of the House who ware
dividing their salaries with others -who
performed no work, and challenged any
one on the other side to deny hla allega
tions. Then he offered a resolution for
the appointment of an investigating com
mittee, which was referred to the Com
mittee on Rule?.
The general deficiency appropriation
bill, the last cf the appropriation bill*.
-was passed.
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts offered an
omendment to appropriate Km for the en
tertainment of President Kruger upon tha
occasion of his visit to this country. Can
non at once made a potnt of order agalns*
it. and Lawrence of Massachusetts, in the
chair, sustained him.
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts critlcJxed
the Government for not preventing the
shipment of horses, mules and supplies
from our ports for the use of the British
army in South Africa. He charged that
the Secretary of State was in league with
the British, and contended that the treaty
of Washington, made between Great Brit
ain and the United States in 1871, was
being violated. His remarks drew from
Hitt. chairman of the Committee on For
eign Affairs, a statement that both the
united States and Great Britain had va
riously construed the treaty of 1571 and
International law as affecting sending of
supplies and arms to belligerents accord
ing to the purpose to be served. By the
ancient doctrine of the American peoplÂ«
a3 to the rights of neutrals to trade, our
people, he said, are free to sell horses, to
sell flour, to sell even arms at their risk.
They may be intercepted, but that is the
doctrine of natfbns.

Â¦ ye^ ORONA, Feb. 21.â Jess Sanders.
n an employe of the Corona De
(l . velopment Company at Temescal,
had a miraculous escape from
instant death last night.
" Sanders and Monte Wilson were digging
at the bo;tom of shaft No. 5, the dirt be
ing hoisted to the surface in a large
bucket operated by ropes, pulleys and a
horse. The bucket being filled, the usual
signal was given and as It began to rise
Sanders thoughtlessly seized one of the
moving ropes with his right hand in an
effort to steady the load. His fingers were
at once drawn Into the pulley blocks, and
he was slowly carried upward with the
bucket of earth. His fellow, worker
shouted "Whoa!" to the horse a number
of times, and when the unfortunate man
had been carried half way up to the
mouth of the shaft the horse stopped for
a few seconds, and then started again.
Just as man and bucket reached the
surface the horse stopped once, more, but
Sandera was unable to extricate himself,
and the animal again moved on and the
unfortunate man was carried upward a
distance of fifteen feet to the top of the
derrick. Just before the pulley blocks met
he made- an effort to free hi3 right hand
by pulling on the opposite rope. The ef
fort was successful, but the left hand was
immediately caught. The unfortunate
man in his agony wrenched his hand loose
and fell like a stone a distance of twenty
nve feet to the bottom of the shaft.
When lifted out he wa3 still conscious,
though bleeding profusely from a cut on
the chin, which extended around to the

Â¦ ' jMAMMOTH ORE VEIN
SEVENTY MILES I*ONQ
Great Mineral Belt Discovered on the
Northern Half of Colvilla
Reservation.
TACOMA, Fsb. 21.â A mammoth vein of
ore seventy miles In length has been
found In Stevens County, on the north
half of the Colvllle_Indlan reservation. It
is claimed to be a true fissure vein, with
Innumerable chutes of rich ore coming to
the surface at frequent Intervals. In some
places this mineral belt reaches a width
of several miles. Several mines are now
being developed on the ore zone, includ
ing the Deer Trail mine at the south and
the Mateline at the north end. It was un
known until recently that one continuous
vein connected these properties. A rush
for good locations along the vein is on.
Mine Sells for a Million.
TACOMA, Feb. 21.â M. E. Downs, who
owns a majority of the stock in the
Ethel gold mine, near Index, on the
Great Northern Railway, is reported from
New York to have sold the mine to New
York men for Jl.000,000. The deal is re
garded as the. most important mining
transaction in years in the Noruiwest.

JUDGE COFFEY SETTLES
W. D. FABEEN'S ACCOTJTIT
Exscutor of Fowler Estate Says Ha
Will Adjust All Claim*
Against TTCTn
"W. D. Farren. executor of the will of
thÂ© late D. D. Fowler, was before Judge
Coffey yesterday to explain the cause of
his absence from this city and his eva
sion of the court's order to account for
the property placed In his keeping. Far
ren was apparently in a repentant mood,
but he said little. He produced his final
account as executor of the Fowler estate,
in which he charged himself with $3000.
He stated that he has securities in bank,
and -with what money he could command
all claims of the estate against him
would be adjusted.
Decedent's heirs and devisees expressed
themselves as satisfied with the arrange
ments Farren had made to turn over the
estate and counsel did the same. Judge
Coffey, however, refused to let the matter
stand thus. Addressing Farren he said
he felt he had violated the confidence of
the court: In fact, had treated It most
contemptuously. In view of the stand the
heirs and attorneys had taken, however,
the matter would be permitted to rest,
the account would be settled and plans
for. the future management of the estate
adopted. The order settling the account
was made, and Farren. accompanied by
his attorney, left the building.
WANTS A GUARDIAN
FOR HIS FATHER
James B. Chase Is Stricken
With Paralysis and His
Son Petitions
Has Been Engaged in Business of
. Ship Ballasting More Than 25
Years â Value of Property
Unknown.
The business career of James B. Chas*.
senior member of the ship ballasting firm
at 17 Steuart street, has ended. In a pe
tition filed yesterday by his son. Harry
F. Chase, for letters of guardianship upon
his father's person and estate, It la se:
forth that on February 12 last he. whs
stricken with paralysU and since that
time has been physically helpless and
mentally weak.
The petitiontr states that, though his
father shows no signs of immediate col
lapse. It is not probable that he will ever
recover. His business Is such, the peti
tioner continues, that It Is necessary that
a guardian be appointed to care for his
person and estate. As Harry F. Chase ha*
been associated with his father In tha
ship ballasting business for some time ho
makes known to the court that he Is a fit
and proper person to care for his father's
interests. The petition will bo heard In
the Probate Court this week.
James B. Chase has been engaged as a
ship ballastman and stevedore In. this city
for more than twenty-five years. In thi*
line of business he> was perhaps the be?t
known man on the coast and has don*
business with ship owners the world over.
Though an elderly man he married hlÂ«
second wife about a year ago-, she bein^
many years his Junior. Besides his son,
who la Interested with him In tha business
of ballasting ships, he has other children
by his .first wife, who^ reached manhood
and womanhood before his second mar
riage.
FRONT, take Mr. Phelan to his
room. No. ITS. Here, take the
keys of the city with you.- Don't
you know the number, hey? I'll
report you to â¢ the Civil Service
Commission." qnd then the fire Kong or
fnme other bell around the City Hall
colloquially called the Hotel Phelan, or
the Hotel de Vil'.e. rang out 1-2-6. That is
the number of Mayor Phelan's room now
In the ancient pile that Is being reno
ratefl.
ThÂ«Â»r<* are others who are wondering
what may be the number of their rooms.
Heretofore if a stranper could not find the
Fupposeflly encyelopediac policeman on
duty In the Hall he vrould a?k for the
Afs^sfot's office, or the Treasurer's of
fVe. or any old*>3ice that he wanted. .It
would be, "take this corridor, turn to left
or right, or go up a flight of stairs, and
f nd the place that you are looking for."
If you did not find It it was your own
fault.
Now all is changed. Bellboys will con
duct city officials to their respective of
fices. If Assessor Dodge wants to dodge
the poll tax collector all he will have to
do is to dorigre the entrance to room 116
and co around to 130. This 1? the number
of hi? private npartmert In the suite ap
portioned .to him. Auditor Wplls has al
most af= many numbers on his doors. If
you want a warrant, go to room 301. but if
you want to fop the Auditor personally
try on*> of the other numbers.
Based on the plan obtaining in larpe of
fioe buildlnps it has been decided to
number the offices in the City Hall. The
first or main floor rur.s from 101 up to the
finish of the century. And thus it goe? to
the top of the dome, but the model statue
that crowns It has eo far only been as
signed to the sky parlor.
When It came to numbering the Super
visors' chamber a great difficulty was
met. How to crowd eighteen guests in a
chamber originally designed for twelve
was a problem hard to solve. It was
finally decided that they were transients
and the overplus micht be accommodated
at Ingleside. Mayor Phelan says he does
not favnr this plan.
Anothpr objection arose about the
School Board boarding-house. School Di
rector WVbst^r has a stairway leading
from the Hoard of Education rooms to his
private apartments, which are en suite
and shared with deputies, on the upper
floor. Xow. thrse rooms are contiguous
to the entrance to Director Casserly's
polo parlors. .Mow to reconcile an armed
conflict is the wish of Superintendent of
Buildings Barnett. who will have to in
stall the proposed callbell system.
Other difficulties confront those who are
attempting to introduce this new-fangled
idf-a. The City Hall is one of the munici
pal relics, but It has never been moved
since the blR earthquake. Now, there Is
Recorder Godchaux. He Is between two
floors, and cannot tell what the number
of his office may be. He placed an order
for an engraved card plate, but had to
cancel it ponding the decision of the num
bering expert.
Down on the ground floor, the numbers
have not been as yet assigned, appor
tioned or allotted. It has been suggested
to start at the iron door of the City Hall
station which once bore the legend "City
Prison" and number that "naughty
naught." This however, seemed too sug
gestive, and until the basement Is cleared
out there will be no tags Issued for the
doors.
Special rules are now being drafted for
the proper conduct of the building.
Section 1S61 cf the Code of Civil Pro
cedure Is to be amended, and section 2 of
chapter 1 of article IV of the new charter
is to be substituted instead. This provides
that objectionable guests may be removed
at the option of the grand potentate that
runs the main office, or room 1-2-6.
The other rules which are now being
formulated will be in substance as fol
lows:
Guests are expected to occupy their
rooms for at least two years. The mu
nicipality will supply light, water and at
tendance, but in the event of any breach
of decorum the rooms must be sum
marily vacated.
Turn off the gas before leaving your
rooms. This means that lights may be
left burning where not essentially needed.
Do not drive tacks In the floor or nail
political signs on the walls. For adver
tising space apply to th? Board of Works.
Officeholders who quit before their term
of service expires will be charged full
rates.
On leaving your office bolt all doors and
leave your valuables with the proprietor.
Complaints about service should be
made at once.
Tags will be attached to all keys, and
holders thereof are expected to display
them In a conspicuous manner, so tnat
visitors seeking guests may readily ascer
tain the name and number of all incum
bents.
Other rules will be formulated from
time to time as the exigencies of the ser
vice demand.
There will be some nice printed rules
posted on the newly whitewashed walls as
soon as the-- numbering scheme Is com
pleted.
Community room?, for the benefit of
members of the Board of Supervisors and
}-5oard of Education, will be provided on
the second floor. Wardrobes for polo and
golf outfits will likewise be placed in con
venient locations. The numbers to be as
signed these rooms have not as yet been
definitely determined.

Mrs. Mary Jones, who conducts the Lee

Jones Is many years tho Junior of the lady

was disclosed yesterdav, when Mrs. Jones
asked that the case be reopened. In her

suit for divorce upon the promise of her
husband to treat her with kindness and
consideration. She condoned his oast of

A deficit In the police relief and pen
sion fund has been uncovered by Treas
urer Brooks, and as a. result some
of the eighty-five pensioners now on th^
list may be deprived of their pensions for
a temporary period at least. While the
deficit in the fund for the auarter endlnc
December SI amounts to about $2000 this
sum will be Increased during the two en
sulr.g quarters until It reaches a total of
at least $7000 and It mar reach a much
hlgrher flgrure. The Police Commission has
been notified of this etrl<rus state of af
fairs and the attention of the Board of
Supervisors will be calied thereto In order
that some means ma-.- be taken to pro
vide for the deflclt.
The fact that thero Is a deficit In the
fund Is due to the Insufficient provision
made by the charter for itstbeneflt. The
charter provides that the fund shall be
made up from the receipts received from
dog licenses, sale of unclaimed property,
fines imposed In the Police Court for vio
lations of certain ordinances, fines for
carrying concealed v^apons and other
sources. Each policeman must in addi
tion contribute 12 from hla monthly sal
ary. It is a fact that these sources are
Insufficient to meet the demands of the
pensions and consequently the deficit Is
growing all the time. Treasurer Brooks
cays there has been an alarming decrease
In Police Court fines, which has lessened
the fund considerably. In order to pay
pensions of the last cruarter. amounting
to $13.93S 73. it was necesrary for the treas
urer to borrow J2iXW from the general fund.
This procedure Is not countenanced by the
charter, which forbids Â»he borrowing from
other funds, but It was dore as a matter
of expediency.
In order to meet this condition th;
Treasurer has given notice that the de
mands of the present Quarter must bs
registered in the order of their presenta
tion, en March 31, 1WL TMs will be done
iiÂ» Boon as the money coming in from the
sources mentioned has been exhausted.
This means that the Treasurer will be un
able to pay about $4000 < n that date, as the
$2000 borrowed last quarter from tho gen
eral fund must be renaid. It is believe 1
that the income for the fund will sensibly
decrease from now on and the pensions
will have a natural increase. The Police
Commission will of ncces?iti* not be ah!<Â»
to pension any more policemen until tha
financial tangle is unraveled. The onlv
way in whl^h the estimated -deficit of t'lKil
on July 1. 1901. can be wiped out is for the
Supervisors to levy a K&eclal tax for thi
n*xt fiscal year. Efforts may alco* bÂ«
made to increase the ;evfnup. so that a
deficit raay be avoided next year.

POLICE PENSIONS
ARE IN DANGER
Attorney Kimball of the Federated Mis
sion Improvement Clubs appeared before
the Supervisors' Street Committee yester
day in opposition to the proposed fran
chise to be granted the Bay and Coast
Railway Company to enter the city at
Twenty-fourth and Illinois streets. Kim
ball said that ;f the road is to be run as
an independent line through the Mission
steps should be taken to condemn it as a
nuisance. Vigorous objection would also
be made If the company had any inten
tion of selling the privilege to the South
ern Pacific Company, he said.
"We are endeavoring now and have
been for years to effect the removal of the
Southern Pacific Company's tracks, and
we do not care to be burdened with an
other road," said Kimball. "The terms of
the ordinance granting the franchise are
not satisfactory to us. and more stringent
conditions should be imposed on the com
pany." _
Max Popper suggested that if the road
Is to be constructed it should be required
to cross streets by underground or over
head methods, and he asked that such a
condition be inserted in the ordinance.
Attorney Baggett. representing the rail
way company, stated that if the objec
tions held it would practically exclude the
building of competing railway lines. He
deprecated the insinuation that the pro
posed road was In collusion with the
Southern Pacific and would ultimately
sell out to that corporation.
"We have consented to the most oner
ous conditions to build this road." said
Baggett. "We have agreed to expend $25.
000 in construction before' next June. We
are willing to build bridges, but we can
not promise to build an underground sys
tem. I will simply say. that if any fur
thr-r delay .Is encountered the proposition
will be abandoned by the Interests I rep
resent."
The committee will meet next Monday
to consider the matter further.
Secretary Painter of the Xorth Central
Improvr-mcnt Association informed the
committee that a bill had been introduced

SOME OPPOSITION
TO COAST ROAD
Auditor Wells Is greatly Incensed at the
effort made by the Board of Trade to in
terfere in the proposed movement on foot
to pay off the city's indebtedness. Wells
received a circular yesterday signed by
F. W. Eaton, the surviving member of
the committee representing what Is desig
nated as the "associated creditors of the
city and county of San Francisco," In
which the creditors are requested to file
their claims with the secretary of the
Board of Trade for purposes of collec
tion. Attached to the circular is the fol
lowing agreement to be signed by auch
creditors;
And .we do hereby severally agree that- not
to exceed 25 per cent of the amounts of our
respective claims so collected shall be retained
by II. L. Smith to compensate and fully sat
isfy all of the expenses Incurred by the com
mittee appointed at a meeting of the merchant
creditors held August 17. 181)6.
The circular says that as the constitu
tional provision limits the entire payment
to $500,000, and the Auditor reports the
claims to bo $600,000, it will be necessary
to authorize the. waiving of interest and
to assign the sum of $lu0,000 in order to
meet the expenses.
"I cannot see how the Board of Trade
has anything to do with this affair,", said
Auditor Wells. . "I shall certainly resent
Its interference in a matter which con
cerns only the Board of Supervisors and
the Auditor. These claims are on record
in my office, and all that is necessary in
order to receive payment on them is to
make a proper presentation of them. I
certainly discountenance the paying of
any commission for their collection, as I
have already expressed myself regarding
teachers' claims. The Board of Trade will
not help matters '. in any way, and it
might Just as well abandon all Idea of so
doing. It is in error when it states that
the claims amount to more than $600,000.
My figures, recently published, place the
aggregate Indebtedness at between $300,
000 and $400,000.
-.'Regarding teachers' claims, I hold that
they cannot be paid in their present shape
out of the surplus fund. An agreement*
must be had with the Board of Supervi
sors, which will permit them to be put In
Judgment. The city may then waive an
appeal and the surplus fund be used for
the purpose indicated.
"Regarding City Attorney Lane's opin
ion that the surplus fund can only be used
for municipal betterment, I take the stand
that no better use can be made of thÂ«s
surplus fund of this year than to pay tha
clty'3 Indebtedness. If the debt Is to be
paid at all there is no way in which it
would be felt less by the taxpayers. . Un
less the .present surplus fund is so used
no part of the old Indebtedness of the city
will be paid during the term of the pres
ent city officials. It is right that this
money should be so : expended, and such
action would be approved by the people.
To withhold payment longer now that we
have the money is disgraceful.".-
Says It Has No Right to
Meddle in Collection
of Claims.
AUDITOR ASSAILS
BOARD OF TRADE
JUDGE KERRIGAN has Bet aside
the default entered against Jose
phine Hayden In the action for di
vorce Instituted by Edwin Hay
den, manager of the Hayden
Packing Company, and the brief freedom
enjoyed by the plaintiff under the decree
is at an end. Mrs. Hayden asserts that !
the decree of divorce was procured by
her husband through fraud; that while
ho was quietly proceeding against her In
the courts they were living together, and.
she thought, happily. Under the order
made by Judge Kerrigan she is granted
the right to file answer to Hayden s com
plaint. Join the Issues and present her de
fense
The litigants were married In this city
in 18S9. For several years they lived con
tentedly together, but one night there was
a quarrel. Mrs. Hayden, who is now re
siding In a rooming house at Stockton
street and Broadway, alleges that her .
husband packed her trunks, Jostled them
out of their home, 1527 California street,
and ordered them taken to a lodging
house onÂ»Turk and Taylor streets, where
ho Informed her she would henceforth
make her residence. There was nothing
for her to do but to obey.
Not long after this Incident Hayden
filed suit for divorce. He charged her
with having Improper relations with
Charles D. Cole. Being Ignorant of the
fact that the divorce suit was being
pressed by her husband, she says he
came to see her. She explained that she
was practically penniless, they adjusted
their differences, she claims, and again re
sumed the relations of husband and wife.
While still llrlng together she claims* ho
entered a default against her In his suit
for divorce, produced testimony in sup
port of his charges against her and se
cured his decree. Then, she says, he
abandoned her, left her penniless, and her
trunks are now held by the boarding
house keeper to secure the payment of
her bill. â¢
After telling her story In court yester
day Judge Kerrigan ordered the decree
vacated and set aside the default. He
then heard testimony on her application
for alimony in the sum of $100 a month,
costs of action and counsel fees. She tes
tified that from his interest in the Hay
den Packing Company he received a
monthly Income of $300. . Hayden took
the stand and denied her allegations. He
said he only had sufficient money for his
own immediate needs and could not pay
the sum demanded by Mrs.' Hayden. The
court will hear further testimony next
Friday.
Mrs. Hayden is the plaintiff's second

adjournment to the banauet hall, where

Stanford Parlor No. 78, the elite parlor
of the Native Sons of the Golden We3t.
gave Its fifteenth anniversary ball in the
main hall of the Native Sons' building,
last nlsht, and It proved to be the best
of the many social functions that this
parlor has given. Ths decorations, by A.
F. Schleicher, one of the members, were
the most unique ever seen In the hall. Tl.e
mural effects and those on the gallery and
the stage were Chineseâ thi-t is, banners.
Hags and draperies artistically arranged,
while in the center hung a dream of deco
rative art illumined by seventy electric
lights. The arrangement, novel In a ball
room, was most enchanting and won the
commendations of all who were in the
room. The members of the several con
mlttees, in lieu of the ordinary badges,
wore long silken tassels of different col
ors, according to the commivtve on which
they served. And to carry the Oriental
idea still further the orchestra played as
an introductory to the grand march a se
lection from the Chinese opera of "Chan
Tow" that was composed for the Dowager
Empress of China. '
Owing to the unavoidable absence of |
William D. Hynes, floor director, the
grand march was led by Bruce Cornwall,
his assistant, and Miss Florence Scatena.
Every one who was In the march was at- |
tired in full evening dress, many of the
gowns worn by the ladies b'eing the Â£-cme
of modiste's designs. - |

A: POOR: BREAKFAST.
Very Few People Eat a Good Break-

'."All I want for breakfast Is 'a roll and
a cup of coffee." â¢ â¢
This remark Is heard not only In hotels,
restaurants and lunch rooms, but it Is the
usual breakfast order. In the home circle
as well. After- a twelve hours' fast It
would seem that the first meal of the
day should be a hearty, substantial one.
and If we all 'lived natural, unartiflclal
lives, it would be so, but none of us do
hence breakfast is a mere pretense.
Says a latter-day philosopher: "During
many years of active business life, I never
remember having eaten a good, substan-
tial breakfast, but supposed it was of no
Importance until I bc-gan to loss appetite
for lunch and dinner. Â¦Â¦<Â¦:>
"My physician told me I was a victim of
nervous dyspepsia and must take rest and
recreation, as no medicine would reach
the.trouble, but -'this advice I could not
follow, as my business affairs would not
permit It; and to gH relief I resorted to
medicines and prescriptions, and It was
purely accidental that I hit upon one rem-
edy which did the business. While in a
drug store one eveninsr I noticed a number
of people buying Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets, a widely advertised preparation for
stomach troubles, and the force of ex-
ample was too much for me and I bought
a fifty-cent, package.
"I took atabletor two after each meal,
and In a week my appetite picked up, I
began to: feel my old ambition for work
returning and could cat a good breakfast
because I wanted it. and from that time
to this I take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
as regularly as. I take my meals, not be-
causo I now have any trouble with my
stomach, but because I don't want to
have.
Â¦ -"A -fifty-cent box of Stuart's Tablets
will last me a month and keep my diges-
tion In good order, and I know of no bet-
ter investment a business man can make."
