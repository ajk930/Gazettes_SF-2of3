The brief report of the fate of three
members of the pÂ°?.ce committee who
were sont to see General Dewet excites
the deepest indiEnatinn on all sides. One
or two papers express a hope that Lord
Kitchener has been misled by false re
ports, but it is felt generally that he
would not report the matter to the War
Office without undoubted evidence.
The Daily Mall heads the report with
the word "Murder." and declaims against
any further attempt to coax the enemy
into submission. â¢
"Dcwet has placed himself outside the
pale of humanity." says the Daily Mail,
"and not proclamations, but large rein
forcements, must be our watchword."
The Morning Post says: "This marks
the point where the guerrilla phase ends

All the papers appeal strongly to the

conciliation is quite useless.

surrender.
Details of the attacks upon Kaalfontein
and Zmirfontein stations show that there
were only small garrisons of about 120
men at each station. The British had ex

withstand the attacks until the Boers,
having ascertained that reinforcements
were coming to the garrisons, retired. At
Zuurfontein a party of Boers in khaki

It seemed they had been preparing to take
a bath and that in some way or other
they had allowed the magnificent bath
reservoir to overflow.
Rev. Mr. Johnson then told an officer
that he was not infatuated with the sleep

wanted was a comfortable doubl* bed. and
he asked if this could not be arranged. A
bed for two was rigged up by bringing 1
In settees and cushions from unoccupied
staterooms and with these they con
structed what the sailors called " a four
legjjed bedstead."
One Sunday was passed at sea. Rev.
Mr. Johnson took a prominent seat In the
congregation while religious observance
was held.
Regarded as Actors.
The Tunisian's officers say that the
theory generally accepted on board re
garding the bride and groom was that
they were actors, recently married, who
were "blowing In" a large part of their

of the officers spoke to me particularly
of Miss Hoffman's handsome arms, which,
except for thin, muslin-like material, he
raid, were generally bare close up. to her
shoulders. She would, when the bugle
sounded for dinner, sometimes come out
of the stateroom ahead of Mr. Johnson
attired in ultra-fashionable evening dress.
I fotmd no one on the Tunisian who
r had received from them any hint of what
i their movements would be after reaching
iLoverpool. or what the future 'had in
store for them. The steward found the
couple good passengers to wait upon. One
of them told me that they were exceed

ever was asked for had to be done ex

Line steamer Tunisian arrived here from
Liverpool ai 4 p. m. The Call's represen
tative met her officers at the dock, the re
sult of his Interview with them establish
ing beyond doubt the fact that two of the
Tunisian's passengers on her last outward
bound trip were Rev. James Le Baron
John?on of New York and Miss Mary
Hoffman, the beautiful San Francisco
girl.
â¢ The fact that/they journeyed under the
names of L. F. Montgomery of Louis
ville. Ky.. and Mrs. Montgomery, did not
at all detract from their enjoyment of
the trip, for Captain Vipont, who com
manded the steamer, nor any of his offi
cers or passengers -new that it was an
eloping couple. They were known famil
iarly and spoken of as the "bride and
groom."
There are only two bridal suites of
rooms on the' Tunisian and Rev. Mr. John
son and Miss Hoffman had. one of them.
They paid for the luxury of occupying this
bridal suite the sum of JSOO.
Captain Vipont and the purser were or
dered by Johnson to fit up the bridal
suite in any way required by distinguished
passengers. These orders were carried
out to the letter and the whole resources
of the Tunisian v.rre at the disposal of
gay Mr. anrf Mrs. Montgomery.
No Doubt as to Identity.
It is certain that "Mr. and Mrs. L- F.
Montgomery of Louisville] Ky.." were
Rev. James lse Baron Johnson and Miss
Mary Hoffman. Half a dozen of the
sh-p's officers who had been in constant
contact w'.th them declared, without the
slightest hesitation and with the utmost
confidence when shown the photographs
published in The'Call:
"Oh, yes. that's the bride. and groom,
Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, who occupied
the bridal suite on the saloon deck.' 1
The . train that brought Johnson and
"the-"bride\* to Halifax arrived, here about
10 o'clock in the forenoon and the ateamer
sailed at once. Their baggage was ad
dressed "L. F. Montgomery, Halifax."
The steamer's name, for some reason, was
not included In the address on the. trunks.
This caused Johnson a lot of trouble, for
the baggage was pitched off at the pas
singer station and was not carried down
by the train to the steamer's side. He
was afraid It was lost. A hue and cry,
were raised and special messengers were
sent back to hunt it up. They found it
all right, however, and a. full hour before
the Tunisian sailed it was safely on board
and so were the bride and groom. They
did no sightseeing about town, but at
once betook themselves to their state
rooms.

TACOMA, Jan. 13.â News reached Taco^
ma to-day that two masked men held lip
the saloon of Joseph Ryes at Wflkeson
and robbed the barkeeper and seven men
who were drinking there shortly after
midnight Saturday night. ..They ".secured
1120, besides an assortment of .gold
watches, rings and ' other small Jewelry.
The Job was executed so quickly and
neatly that the participants scarcely re
alized what had happened until their cash
had vanished together with the highway
men.
It was evident that the robbers were old
hands at the business. Though wearing
masks and brandishing revolvers they en
tered the saloon unconcernedly and gavÂ«Â»
their orders quietly. Two of the men at
the bar started to yell when the robbers
entered, but quickly desisted when both
robbers turned their guns upward and be
gan perforating the ceiling. The bartender
and seven .customers .were then told to
line up In a row and hold up their hands
They complied without a protes..' Ths
robbers consisted of the proverbial long
and short man. . The lonjr man Â¦>â¢ took
hie position at one *nd of the row, keep
ing his gun leveled at the heads of th<j
victims. The short man proceeded to
open the till, from which $120 was taken.
He helped himself to a drink of "whisky
and then went around and searched the
bartender and customers. '. : .
Watches and rings and about US In cash
were taken. The safe behind the bar con
tained several hundred dollars, but it was
locked and no attempt was made to open
it.: By this time ten minutes had been
consumed and the robbers looked toward
the door as If expecting newcomers. They
swiftly took their departure and one of
the spectators was 3till holding up his
hands when two men entered a few.mln
utes later. H > iM* t l!T?V*^

gard to the scandal connected .with the
awarding of medals at the Paris Exposi
tion and the charges that Varney W.
Gaskill, secretary of the California Com
mission to the World's Fair, had at
tempted to charge local exhibitors ex
orbitant prices for medals awarded.
"The letters which were published In
the Herald," said Secretary Wiggins,
â¢were written by Gaskill to George Wil
liams and Frank Schumacher, but they
were not intended for publication. They
were turned over to me and I sent them
north, bo that a thorough investigation
could be made.
â¢â¢While It would appear that Gaskill de
sired to charge $20 for medals which the
Fair Commissioners offered for less than
a fourth of that amount, still appear
ances may be wrong and Gaskill's quota
tions correct. It is a hard matter to fol
low up, as quotations are still coming
from Paris. The only thing we can do
now is to wait.
"The reason the Chamber of Commerce
is taking up the matter is that that body
was, In many instances, responsible for
the exhibits made, in that it induced thj
exhibitors to send displays to Paris. When
Mr. Williams received the letter from
Gaskill it made him angry and he came
to me. I told him and the other ex
hibitors who had won prizes to wait, as
quotations were still being received and
that medals would be cheap in Paris be
fore long. Then I sent the letters to Sac
ramento In order that a thorough Investi
gation might be made."

Anderson, in his letter, declining to serve
on the Committee on Commissions and
Public Expenditures, neglected to address
the communication "To his Excellency
the most exalted and honorable Speaker

MENTO. Jan. 13.-W. H. Mills came up
frcm San Francisco on the 4 o'clock train
this afternoon. He denies that his pres
ence in Sacramento is due in any degree
to the proposed Investigation of the con
duct of California's Paris Exposition
Commission, and asserts that he has no
interest whatever in the investiBation.
He said to-night:
"The value to be derived from an in
quiry into this matter by the Assembly
committee will consist wholly in teach
ing the State how to make exhibits of its
products and resources. What concerns
the State is not the personal conduct of
the Commissioners during their stay in
Paris. How the money appropriated from
the State treasury was spent and what
results were accomplished are the proper
subjects of investigation. So far as tiie
scandals that have been floating about
relative to the conduct of the Commis
sioners are concerned, they are not worth
bothering about, and if the investigation
is to become a flea-hunt, it is not- worth
undertaking, and it will come to noth
ing.
â¢Personally. I know nothing of this
scandal, but I have my ideas of the
proper way to exhibit a States products,
i-nd any legislative conclusion that may
be reached will not change those Ideas.
I am neither prosecutor nor defendant in
this investigation, ajid am utterly indif
ferent as to whether it is made or not."
Mr. Mills was accompanied from San
Francisco by General N. P. Chipman.
Both are members of the State Board of

These two bodies will hold separate meet

ence at Granger s Hall. The Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce will give the visi
tors representing the three bodies a re
ception at the Sutter Club to-morrow
night.
r i"he conference to-morrow will be part
ly devoted to the consideration of pro
posed legislation, notably the measures
proposed by the California Water and
forestry Association, but more particu
larly two propositions made to these in
terior associations by the State Board of
Trade. One is that agents from the two
organizations be kept at the State Board
of Trade rooms in San Francisco, and
the other is that they exert themselves
net only to send adequate exhibits to the
Buffalo Exposition but also to send rep
resentatives there to give intelligent ex
planation of our resources to all inquirers
"As to the first proposition," Mr. Mills
eaid to-night, "with the completion of the
Coast line Eastern tourists who enter the
State by the Southern lines will come
to San Francisco by that route without
passing through the great interior val
ieys. The best place to reach them will
be in San Francisco, and we have invited
thÂ«>se two important associations to keep
agents at the State Board of Trade rooms
for that purpose. Our exhibit there dis
plays quite fully the products of both
valleys, and we can turn over to them all
inquiries from tourists and prospective
settlers which have relation to their lo
calities."
The other proposition, concerning the
Buffalo Exposition, was made by General
Chipman. He said of it:
"We have found that an exhibit does
not talk for itself. There must be pres
ent intelligent men who know the State's
resources and are able to talk about them.
They must be at hand to talk to inquiring
visitors about conditions and life in Cali
fornia, else the exhibits fail In their pur
pose.
"Besides these two valley association*.

NOVEL PLAN TO SAVE
STRANDED LIGHTSHIP
Vessel to Be Moved Overland Like a
House and Launched
on the Columbia
River.
EpeelaJ Di*x>Â«.tch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Jan. 13.â The floating of the
ftranded Columbia River lightship is one
of the mopt unique marine undertakings
ever attempted on the Pacific Coast. The
stranded vessel Is to be moved, like a
house, over the southwestern extremity
cf Washington and placed in Baker's Bay
in the Columbia opposite this city. The
contract for the Â¦work will shortly be let.
The lightship broke loose from her
moorings off the mouth of the river over
thirteen months ago during a heavy gale
and went ashore on the beach near the
North Head lighthouse. Repeated efforts
have been made to float her by the sea
ward route, but all have failed signally,
and the contractors who undertook the
work lost considerable money.
When the liEhtEhip firet went ashore
Contractor Lcbeck of this city visited the
scene of the wreck, and, after thoroughly
examining the vessel's position, expressed
the belief that she could never be floated
to seaward, but that the only practicable
plan was to move her over the peninsula
and place her In the Columbia. The cost
of this work would have been greater than
that of tfce eeaward route, and the light
house board refused to consider Mr.
Lebeck's suggestion. All other attempts
having failed, however, the board has de
cided to adopt tbe overland plan, and bids
â¢will be called for as soon ax permission is
obtained from the War Department to

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 13.â The apportionment bill
promises a lively fight. Cutter, who In
troduced It. has turned the conflict over
to the different delegation' with full per
mission to "scrap," and then coma Into
the committee with: the results, of the
battle. These will bÂ» the smaller dis
tricts. In the Congressional districts the
Interests of the party and the wishes of
the different counties may conflict and re
sult In the creation of a district, the Sixth,
almost certainly Democratic. The original
plan was to make the Fifth District out of
the lower part of San Francisco. San Ma
teo and Santa Cruz, throwing Santa Clara
Into the Sixth District. This would maka
the Sixth District composed of San Joa-
Quln. Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Mono, Mari
poea, Madera, Merced, Fresno. San Ben
lto, Monterey, Kings, Tulare and Inyo,
which would be Democratic, and Santa
Clara, whose certain Republican majority
would be sufficient to turn the scale and
make the Sixth District Republican. But
Santa Clara has signified a desire to re
main in the Fifth District, leaving Santa
Cruz to the Sixth, and she has votea
enough to make her desire a strong one.
If Santa Clara insists on remaining in the
Fifth District, she probably will be al
lowed to stay there. Â¦
Over in San Joaquu> there Is another
knotty problem. The lumber and mining
Interests have been put in the First Dis
trict as far as possible, giving the district
Del Norte, SiskiyoÂ«, Modoc, Humboldt,
Trinity, Shasta, Lassen. Mendoclno. Teha
ma, Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, EX
Dorado, Amador, Calaveras Â«">i Alpine.
This would leave Sam D. Woods of San
Joaquin. the present representative of tha
mining Industry, In an agrioulttfral dis
trict, and would leava a clear field for J.
N. Gillette of Humboldt, reputed to be.
after a seat In Congress. The mining
counties want to keep Woods, and they
are clamoring for San Joaquin to be taken
into tha First District.
Contra Costa wants to drop AJaraeda

Weary of cheering and snap-shotting
him, the Continental admirers of Mr. Kru
ger have been examining his hands with
a view to obtaining fresh food for adora
tion, says the London Mall. The Paris
Vie Illustree publishes a photograph of
Mr. Kruger's hands, as Â¦well as the profes
sional opinion of a famous Parisian chiro
mancer thereon. The left thumb is miss
ing, a gun accident depriving Oom Paul of
; that useful member early in life.
Mme. de Thebes, the chiromancer, after
a lengthy examination of the photograph,
sent In the following comments:
"These two hands resemble each other
very little, and prove that the theories of
the ancient peoples were right when they
said that the left hand was the hand of
fate, the right hand the hand of will.
"Kruger's left hand is almostNthe hand
of an animal. The nails are broad and
i Indicate action and force. The forennger
Is longer than the others, showing a ter
rible authority without reasoning, a desire
for command, everything by brute force,
a primitive hand if ever there was one.
"As to his intellectual culture, he has
turned , toward the soil, for he Is a coun
tryman before everything. He loves the
soil; he loves his country and understands
'nothing else. His nature, which has re
mained upright and loyalâ the primitive
form of the left hand indicates that to us
âonly thinks of keeping Its independence
and In defending his country he defends
himself.
"Now look at his right hand. What a
change! How this man is well informed!
How this square hand Indicates reflection!
The forefinger, which represents intuition
and inspiration, is as long as the middle
finger; intuition which exercises control,
which analyzes before acting, which con
i celves clearly and justly, and which goes
forward with the fixity of fate. Note
these two fingers of equal length, which
is very rare. It is predestination.
"And these two fingers are close to
gether and Indicate the man with whom
we have to deal. He-goes against fatali
ty. He commands it, he resists It, he bat
tles with it. and he overcomes it. for the
long thumb, which almost reaches the
first phalange .of the forefinger, shows a
will of iron.. The left hand indicates that
he docs not feel physical suffering. The
right hand shows that moral suffering
does not. affect him.
"These nngers/ which , are longer than
the palm, are those of an Idealist, hence
his love for the Bible. This man, who has
little Intellectual. culture, has found there
an outlet, for bis mysticismâ it finds Its
outlet In chanting and reading the
Psalms. I haft not. unfortunately, the
lines written in these two hands, but I
can affirm that they are not of clay; they
are. of brass."

from them follow:
"I replied: 'Say nothing of my relig

be sought in my life. If that has been
honest and dutiful to society, the religion
which has regulated it cannot be a bad

"It is a singular anxiety that some peo

Would the world be more beautiful . were
all our faces alike? were our tempers, our
talents, our tastes, our forms, our wishes,
aversions and pursuits cast exactly In the

Mrs. Kennedy slept to-day until 3
o'clock in the afternoon. When she was
taken to her cell last night she became
nervous and the jail officials called a phy
sician to attend her. It was her first ex
perience behind iron bars, the first days
having been passed in the police matron's
room, and when left alone In her cell she
realized for the first time apparently the
enormity of the charge against her.- It
was feared for a time that she was going
to be seriously ill, but the physician suc
ceeded in quieting her nerves, after which
she slept soundly. She ate a hearty meal
this afternoon and seemed greatly re

When married to Kennedy a month ago,
the woman gave the name of Lulu Prince.
She had formerly kept company with Pat
ten. Patten lives at Westport. N. Y.

tim of a conspiracy.

pitcher of the Kansas City Baseball Club.
Dr. Cross said the woman made this
statement the first time she came to his
office.

to some sensational testimony. Later,
the prisoner, before a Justice of the
Peace, made a formal plea of not guilty
and was remanded to jail for her pre

Wednesday next.

on the part of the Republican majority.
This means there will be no election on
the first ballot. . The failure to hold a
caucus Is on account of the inability, of
many Senators, to. agree on rules govern

Senators are to be elected complicates
matters, and Republican leaders fear the

it that a deal is on by which
Arden, the handsome home of
Madame Modjeska, and its appur

property of an Eastern millionaire. This
report is given further color" by the fact
that Modjeska is said to have given out
to her intimate friends here her intention
of spending six months in Europe at the
conclusion of the theatrical season, which
by some Is Interpreted to mean that the
famous actress may fulfill her long cher
ished desire and return to the land of her
near the mouth of which a concrete dam
twenty-eight feet high has been built. The
length of the dam from bank to bank is
eighty feet and its foundation is solid
rock, an excavation of eight feet having
been made for that purpose.
A topographical map of the entire prop
erty has also been prepared and forward
ed to the famous actress in New York.
This gives color to the story that the
property is about to change hands.
Madame Modjeska has always expressed
a desire to return to the scenes of her
early life in Poland, and the disposal of
her property here probably marks the first
step toward the accomplishment of tails
plan.

HONOLULU. H. T.. Jan. 5.â The meet
.ing of the first Territorial Legislature
early in February again brings political
issues to the front. In spite of the fact that
the Republican and Democratic parties
together spent over $00,000 on the late
election in Honolulu and the island of
Oahu, they are virtually without repre
sentation in the Legislature. Although
the Republican party alone spent over
$35,000 of the above amount it was beaten
through afPalliance with the missionary
faction, which resulted In a large portion
of the Republican and all of the native
vote being cast for the Independent ticket.
Allied with a strong element of the Re
publican party, the Independents are now
well organized and will go into the com
ing legislative tight under skillful and
trustworthy leaders. The various fac
j tions of the Independent or "Home Rule"
party, as they call themselves, have al
ready consolidated and have agreed In
caucus that any Representative or Sena
tor who betrays the party policy by vot
ing against it will at once have the seat
declared .vacant. The Home Rulers have
sufficient votes in both branches to carry
out this threat. This position is taken,
the leaders assert, to hold the native mem
bers together against the liberal use of
money to be made by the defeated par
1 ties. The anti-home rule light, it is
charged, will receive the backing of the
Planters' Association, the old mlsslonary
party-and the sugar faction of the Re
publican party.
Holding a majority in both branches of
the Legislature, the Home Rule party
will at the outset introduce a new election
law and a bill embracing radical changes
in the system of taxation, which the lead
ers assert will not only hold the natives
together solidly in the future, but will
draw largely the support of the mechani
cal and labor elements. The new election
law, which will be early introduced, will
be a modification of the Australian ballot
system and will make it impossible for
the planters or other political factions to
control the nominating conventions. In
fact, it is said, the new law will abrogate
nominations by political conventions. The
new tax system is understood to be" of
such a nature that it will equalize taxa
tion, will insure the prosperity of the
middle and laboring classes, and will in
crease the revenue without being a bur
den, as at present,- upon the poor man a.
The Home Rule party will also insist
upon a well organized plan of municipal
government. At this point the great fight
of the first Territorial Legislature will
take place against the allied forces of the
two defeated parties, the sugar planters
and the present local government. In
other words, President McKinley's ap
pointees, backed by their friends, will be
found in the front of the battle against
the voters of the Territory and their elect
ed representatives.

BUTTE. Mont.. Jan. 13.â "Swiftwater
Bill," who is also known by his right
name of William Gates, has Just added
another incident to the many that have
gone to make up the fame and notoriety
of the successful Klondike goldseeker.
One of his ox-wives, Gussie Lamore, in
hysterics says he has eloped with her
young sister Belle, alter she had been led
to expect that he would take her back to
his heart again. Swiftwater recently re
turned from Alaska with new stories of
success and wjth plenty of money. He
was on liis way to Europe, he said, to in
terest Ei -Hsh capital in a new mining
.scheme he had evolved, and had stopped
in i>"tte to visit his ex-wife and her sis
ter, who also came back from the Klon
dike not long ago. He was here several
days and astonished even some of the old
?I>enders of Butte by the way he scat
tered his money. He and Gussie were to
gether constantly and he began to think
s-o well of her again that he made her a.
present of a hall interest in several rich
mining claims in Alaska.
Her friends were given to understand
that she and Swiftwater were about to
become reunited and indeed everything
looked that way until last night, when
Swiftwater left for the Kast and pretty
little Belle Lamore disappeared at the
same time.
This morning Gussie discovered that
Belle and Swiftwater went together and
tickets had been purchased for Xew York.
While she was tearing her hair over the
discovery, a friend brought her a message
froni her sister telling her that she and
Swiftwater were going to get married as
soon as they reached New York, and that
they would go together to Europe. Gussie
felt so badly about it that she could not
appear to-nig-ht at the local variety thea
ter at which she and her sister ha'd been
playing, but she sent a telegram to her
othsr sister, Grace, at San Francisco,
the second ex-wife of Swiftwater, to tell
her about the calamity and Swift water" X
evident intention to marrv and divorce
the entire Lamore family.
Belle, who is but 18 years of age. has al
ways taken Swiftwater's part in the fam
ily troubles and has often declared that
he was not treated right 1 by his other La
moro, wives.

Senate Will Dispose of the
Measure During This

Lengthy Discussion Probable Over
Daniel's Amendment for the
Appointment of Volun
teers as Officers.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.â A programme
of miscellaneous matters will occupy the
attention of the House during the com
ing week. The river and i-arbor bill,
which was debated for three days last
week, will consume one and possibly two
days. Although the bill was criticized
severely during the debate last week, it
is in no danger of failure. Most of tho
attacks came from members who weru
disappointed in what the bill grants for
their localities and the actual opponent*
of the measure will be overwhelmed wher
the final vote is reached. The Dls.rict of
Columbia Committee, which under thj
rules would be entltlad to to-morrow, wiU
demand a day later in the week if they
give way to the river and harbor bill to
morrow. After the latter bill is disposed
of the bill to revise and codify. the postal
laws will be taken up under a special or
der. It will be followed by the District
of Columbia appropriation blU and tha
latter in turn by the postofflce appropri
ation bill if there is any remaining time.
Miscellaneous Questions Will Occupy
V: : - th.Â© Tints.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â The army re
organization bill will continue to engage
the attention of the Senate at least dur
ing the first days of the present ween.
The opinion is quite generally expressed
among Senators that the bill will be acted
upon by the middle of the week and even
the critics of the measure Join in this
dict ion. Many phases of the question in
volved in the army bill remain to be coa
gldered and the general understanding i*
that there will be a general discus
sion before the bill can, be disposed of.
The speech of Senator Platt of Connecti
cut on Friday last in defense of the bill
on general principles will call for replies,
and there are also special features which
will require more or less attention.
Among tnese is Senator Daniel's amend
ment concerning the appointment of
volunteers as officers in the regular army;
the question of the disposition of officers
who have held staff positions and the pro
vision for the enlistment of Filipinos in
the American army. The disposal of all
these questions undoubtedly will nil the
first two or three days of the week.
Senator Allison intends to call up the
legislative and Judicial appropriation
bills when the army bill is acted upon, but
whether this and other appropriation bills
to follow it shall occupy the exclusive at
tention of the Senate so long as they are
on. the calendar is a question which has
not yet been determined. The present
Indications are, however., that the appro
priation bills will be considered in ad
vance of all other measures whenever
they are before the Senate.
When there are no appropriation bills,
the ship subsidy bill will be discussed.
There are still numerous speeches to be
made on this measure and already there
is talk of night sessions for its consider
ation when it is taken uo.
There is little in the legislative bill to
arouse discussion, but there is a poss'
billty that Senators hostile to the sub
sidy bill may use the appropriation bill
for the purpose of delay.
Next Saturday will be devoted to eulo
gies in memory of the late Senator Gear.

3PRIMARY ELECTION BILLS.
PROSPECTS for the enactment of a satisfactory
primary election law at this session of the Leg
islature are repotted from Sacramento to b?
bright and promising. Many of the ablest and best
men in each house are giving close attention to the
subject. Several bills dealing with the issue have
been introduced, and as it is announced that others
are to follow there will be no lack of methods and pro
visions to choose from when the time comes to blend
the best of them into one bill and enact it.
From a multitude of counsel in legislative bodies
there is not always wisdom. It not infrequently hap
pens that the more the counselors the more the wrang
ling, and that the outcome is a compromise measure;
which, being neither flesh, fowl nor good red herring,
Is virtually valueless. In this case, however, such a
result is not likely to occur. The issue is one which
involves no partisan or factional advantage. The law
when adopted will apply equally to both parties.' The
only class of men who can have any desire to defeat
the measure or distort it are the corrupt bosses and
their following. It ought to be easy, however, to
guard against their machinations, and since so many
of the most reputable and public-spirited men in the
Legislature are earnestly at 'work in the task of de
vising a good bill it iÂ» reasonable to expect. they will
succeed.
It is, to be borne in mind, moreover, that the present
Legislature has the opportunity of profiting by the
mistakes made in previous; primary laws. The de
cisions of the Supreme Court on former acts serve to
show what is to be avoided in the bill. For, the rest
the things to be remembered are that the bill should
be as simple as possible; that it should fully protect
the rights of all citizens, and provide a system by
which nominations for office may be made by the
people and not by the bosses and their tools. .

One line of trade, however, is lagging badly. There
is no call whatever for dried fruit, owing to the great
abundance of fresh tropical fruits on the Atlantic sea
board and the large fruit crops all over the world
Prunes are in a bad way, and those who are in charge
of the crop are devising all sorts of means to get rid
of the surplus before another crop comes in. But
with the exception of dried fruits the farm products
of the State are generally in satisfactory condition, and

In San Francisco the conditions remain as before

for the deficiency in the rainfall, which is pronounced.
The crops are looking well all over the State, if we
except some districts in the south, where heavy frosts
have done some damage to citrus fruits and summer
vegetables. The oil industry is still attracting general
attention and the daily transactions on the Oil Ex
change are remarkably large, and as a rule at rising
prices.
The best trade reports continue to come from the
West and South. The general staples stand about as
they have done for some weeks. Wool shows rather
more steadiness and. a fair demand is reported for
boots and clothing, and structural iron and
steel. There have been few price changes of la.te,
side from advances in sugar and coal oil, and a weak
ening off in provisions at the Western packing points.
None of these changes show any general change in
the condition of trade, one way or the other. A feel
ing of confidence continues to pervade the country,
and therj are no signs of any disturbance.
General business, as shown by the weekly bank
clearings, is very good. These clearings last week
frr.Mied 41.4 per cent over the same week last year, and
no city of importance, except Milwaukee, sTiowed a
loss. The gain at New York was 56.5 per cent, largely
due to activity in Wall street and the disbursement of
the January dividends, which set -millions of dollars
into general circulation. The other large cities also
showed substantial gains. The week's failures were
324. against 274 last year.
WALL street was the center and mainspring of :
commercial activity last week. It reached out
into the wheat and cotton markets and by i
large purchases stimulated both for some days, but a
reaction followed and toward the close both staples
quieted down. Wheat lasted longer than cotton, and
even after the reaction- was supposed to have set in
heavy purchases by Armour and Wall-street operators

Wall street has gained enormously in power during
the past year or two. Formerly it was merely the
center of "stock gambling; then it became more solid
and was the nucleus of the financial operations of the
country; now it is the overshadowing pivot on which
the great bulk of American business turns. Still
more, it has become a haven of refuge for those Euro
pean bourses which are hard up for funds. During
the past year it has loaned money to England, France,
Germany. Russia, Sweden and Mexico. Indeed, it
has become so bound up with these countries in a
financial way that financiers like Henry Clews are
beginning to question whether this European expan
sion has not been overdone. Time alone will teiL
At present everything seems to be flourishing in the
street. Stocks have lately been very active, and the
demand for first-class bonds for investment shows no
abatement This activity has been stimulated by the
prowing ease of the money market, due more or less
to the return of funds from the interior. At the same
time the London market has been growing stringent
and has been leaning upon Wall street more or .less
for assistance. We may have to ship gold there to
ease that situation, and have a certain quantity which
can be spared for that purpose without unduly harden
ing our own market. Financiers, however, are apt to
look askance at exports of. gold, even when it is. bor
rowed from us.

Liquia fuel as a substitute. for coal Is
apparently not looked upon with favor in
the British and United States navies, and
an unfavorable report has been made by
our naval engineers against using petro
leum on the torpedo-boats. Yet this
liquid fuel is used with success In a num
ber of merchant steamers and on naval
vessels of France, Germany "and Russia,
The French flagship oh tho China station
uses It . almost exclusively, and the Ger
man battleship Brandenburg and cruiser
Fuerst Bismarck are likewise using
liquid fuel. Several Russian battleships
have furnaces to burn either coal or
petroleum, the grates oi which can be
changed for either purpose in three hours.
The price of Cardiff coal at Singapore is
at the present time about $14 a ton, while
liquid fuel Is only $6 per ton, with a rela
tive steam-raising power of 23 to 30 in fa
vor of the latter. It is not alone that
liquid fuel is cheaper and better for
steaming purposes, but its use dispenses
with the large fireman force, which lat-
I ter item saves a large expense and re
lieves the boiler room of its terror when

Since the storm the News estimates that something
like $2,000,000 has been expended in repairing and
restoring buildings. It sa'ys $400,000 was appropriated
to aid destitute people who had formerly owned
homes in repairing the damage to their houses or in
building new ones. More than a thousand cottages
have been erected through that assistance, and the
housing problem is therefore pretty nearly solved.
A complete study of the losses caused by the storm
shows that the damage amounted to about $17,058,275.
The largest losses were in residences and in househo'd
effects. These are placed at something more than
$8,400,000. The next heaviest loss was in the property
of the United States, Government, the damage to
which is estimated at $3,155,000. The relief contribu
tions in money are ?aid to have aggregated the sum
of $1,200,000, and in addition there were received co">

MOCK SENSATIONAL TRIAL
FOR CENTURY CLUB
We direct attention to the bill as a matter of inter
est to Californians. We are .'not aware what forces,
if any, are back of it. , The fact'that it; was introduced
by a Representative fromlowa, instead of one from
California* leads to the conclusion that it-has no sup
port in this State. It serves to show, therefore, that
Eastern pcoplehave become^ interested in the preser
vation of the big trees, and that in itself is gratifying.
Before many years are passed the United 'States will
have to take up the question of preserving not only
the big trees of this State but the {forests generally,
and consequently. every new evidence of a willingness
on the part of members of- Congress to co-operate in
legislation to that end is a matter of satisfaction.
The bill is of course designed to protect the' big
trees by making to cut them down or
cut them .up. ;>The commercial ; use of the Sequoia
Gigantea is to be' stooped in the same way that State
banks of issue were stopped by the application of
excessive taxation. r . iyk'^',
due to a pure and disinterested zeal in the good cause
of saving the big trees. .' s - â¢'â¢"'Â¦. '^Vf^
The method he has adopted in making the fight for
the trees is curious. JHe has introduced into Congress
a bill providing: "That from and after the passage>f
this act there shall be levied and collected a tax upon
the manufactured products of the wood of the Sequoia
Gigantea, of big trees/as follows: When such trees arc
cut down there shall be. levied and collected a tax
at the rate of $2 per thousand feet, board measure, to
be scaled as soon as any tree- is felled and cut into
logs; and when one of said logs is cut into lumber or
manufactured in any form there shall be levied and
collected a further tax of $10 per thousand feet, board
measure." â¢
It is far better for a community to have its lands
cultivated in small farms than in big ranches. It is
better to have one hundred families on forty acres
each than to have one family on 4000 acres. That
being so it is hardly likely the progressive elements
of the people in the southern part of Santa Clara will
favor a scheme that will place them in a county whose
administration will be dominated by the owners of big
rrnches. It will be better for them to pay their frac
tion of the taxes needed to maintain the present
county than to enter upon a new one made up mainly
of uncultivated ranch lands or grazing lands, and
whose revenues will consequently have to be derived
mainly by taxation upon the comparatively small
amount of land that is being thoroughly cultivated.
1=3 ROM' the reports published in The Call yester
[ day of the force back of the movement to create
\ft a new county out of a large portion of Santa
Clara and a part of San Benito, it will be seen we are
likely to have to face a contest of no little magnitude.
Experience. in the county division fights in the past
serves as a basis upon which to estimate the character
likely to be assumed by the present one, and conse
quently we may expect many forms of political in
ttijrue-and jobbery.
Upon the surface of things there- is n6 justification
for the movement. Santa Clara County is not too
l?rge either in territory or in population for a. single
administrative control. " The county seat is easily ac
cessible from every district; and there is -nothing in the
topography of the country to give any particular part
of it an interest distinct from the rest. It is true the
southern part of the county is at present mainly com
posed of large ranches and occupied by dairymen of
cattle-breeders, while the northern part is subdivided
h-to small holdings and cultivated as orchards or
vineyards. Such differences, however, are not going
to continue long. The movement of the fruit. and
vine industry southward in the county is going on all
the time. Already in the southern portion the big
Morgan Hill ranch has been subdivided and sold in
tiacts, most of which vary from five to forty acres.
These lands have been planted as orchards, and it is
rot to be doubted that other large ranches in that
section will be eventually treated in the same way.

The freshness of woman's complexion
does not depend upon its thickness, al-

deep.The new officers of Redwood Circle of
the Women of "Woodcraft were installed
last Tuesday night In- Union Square Hall
by Past Guardian Neighbor Mrs. A. I>.
Stenart, assisted by the captain of the
guard. The very pretty ceremony was
followed by the presentation by the circle
through Dr. McLane of- a handsome gold
badge to the retiring guardian neighbor,
Mrs. M. Wilder, who during her term of
office made a very efficient officer. \Then
followed the presentation of a silver and
glass cake dish to the installing officer by
the clerk, Mrs. Jennie A. Clark. A colla
tion and an hour of speeches and song:
followed the ceremonies of the evening.
The <new guardian neighbor, Mrs.
Schwelnhard, has /with her an active
corps of officers, and it is expected that
under her administration the ; circle will

It Is definitely known In banking circles
that both Germany and Great Britain
have the issuance of heavy loans in con
templation. Which will be the first an
nounced, however, cannot be learned. It
is doubtful if satisfactory arrangements
can be made to finance any considerable
portion of these loans here. At least the
arrangements that can be made. It is re
ported, are not as favorable as -those
made when the Â£10,000,000 British ex
chequer loan and the 80,000,000 marks Im
perial German treasury loan were orga
nized. The German Government, it Is un
derstood, has sounded American financiers
through their Berlin correspondents on
the prospect of placing a portion of the
contemplated loan here, but has found
that conditions were not highly favorable.
The German loan could be placed In that
country on better terms than here.
NEW TORK, Jan. 13.â The announce
ment was made In Wall street Saturday
of the authorization by the kingdom of
Saxony of a new 3 per cent loan for 80,000,
000 marks, equivalent to about $20,000,000.
It Is expected that subscriptions -toward
this loan will" be received in this city in
much the same manner as In the case of
the Bavarian loan, offered last week. It
is the opinion of foreign bankers that the
Imperial German Government has decided
to withhold its own national loan, stated
to be for 600,000,000 marks, or $140,000,000,
until the various States of the Govern
ment have made their negotiations. In
quick succession have been offered loans
of the free city of Hamburg, the kingdom
of Bavaria and now the kingdom of Sax
ony.

MRS. ANNIE M. MILLICAN, an
aged Invalid, who resides on
Taylor street, opposite the Bella
Vista Hotel, In a boarding-house
conducted by Mrs. Darling, was
rescued yesterday at 3 a. m. through
the bravery of Hugh Williamson from the
terrible fate of being slowly cremated in
her own bed. The rescue was effected
none too soon, for In a few moments
longer the unfortunate woman would
have been beyond the- . need of human
assistance. She was already on the verge
of collapse. The flames had reached and
scorched one slde\of her body in a fright
ful manner. ThÂ« room was filled with
suffocating smoke and the bedclothes
were a mass of flames. The danger in
curred while attempting the rescue and
the daring manner In which It was accom
plished stamps Williamson as a truÂ» hero.
The unfortunate 'woman, who was a con
firmed Invalid and unable to assist her
self, had a candle burning In her room
during the night In some unknown
manner the candle came in contact with
the bedclothes and Ignited them. Mrs.
Milliean was either too weak or too ter
ror-strlcken to make an outcry, but rolled
away from the flames as far as possible
and watched them burning" their way
toward her. When they finally reached
her she uttered deep groans, which con
tinued for fully a quarter of an hour be
fore they attracted the attention of the
landlady, who got up to Investigate their
cause. Her screams when she discovered
the fire aroused Williamson. Without a

""We students of and believers in
Theosophy," said Charlea W. Leadbeater
of England, concluding a lecture on "The
Unseen World," delivered at Odd Fel
lows' Hall last night, "find that there !Â«<
no heaven far away beyond the stars, nor
Is there any vague, Indescribable hell.
When man passes away from earth he re
mains the same man in the unseen. world
that surrounds us. So far from being the
end, death Is but a step 'from one stage
of existence Into another, leaving man
more fully alive than when' he was
weighed, down by a physical body, lie
remains the same man when relieved of
the physical body as you do when -you
take off your overcoat. The same great
laws that govern the world we see and
arÂ» part of, also govern the world we ; do
not see. We find this to be a definite fact,
from research and Investigation. We pre
sent our views and knowledge in a differ
ent way from the various religions; When
you press the religious teacher too far
and ask for an explanation on some per
plexing point, he tells you to believe It
for it is the teaching of the Bible. But
l_eosophy Is based on the teachings of
the Oriental sages and â¢ what they have
taught has been proved and reproved
again and again. We know that the teach
lnrs of these sages are true, for we have
demonstrated for ' ourselves their truth.
You may think us dreamers or halluci
nated, but the least that vou can do If
you are just Is to admit, that we are try
ing to be scientific in our work.
"Cause and effect in the higher plane
of the unseen world axe the same as In
the world we now inhabit. Everything
that comes to man is a resultâ not as a
reward or a punishment. It comes to him
not by outside adjudication but by natural
law. " The result is of his own 'doing. He
makes his own hell or heaven of life. Hell
Is a blasphemous idea as . generally
preached. The only hell there Is. Is made
by man himself. He makes, bo to speak,
his bed In life and he will have to lie in
it In the unseen world. By his higher and
nobler aspirations he makes a heaven for
himeelf. Life in the higher world Is much
longer and more Important than that here
below. All that we ask of you is to study
the teachings of theosophy. Study and
Investigate, and you will find life easier
to bear and death easier to face."
Professor Leadbeater, in opening his lec
ture, said that the unseen world is per
fectly credible and natural and that It fits
into the world we know and see Â©very
day. That we all do not see it, as do tbÂ»
theosophists, he said, la due to the fact
that the latent powers and faculties with
in us have not been developed. Tha Im
pressions we receive are vibrations, but
many million vibrations escape us. WTien
the latent power Is developed we receive
more vibrations and we respond to them,
thus belne: ablo to see many things that
are now closed to our eyes.
'The various religions," said he, "teach
us that the unseen world does exist. Thjy
speak of a heaven far away, but as they
teach It, that heaven seems vague and un
real to the scientific man and ha puts it
aside. Mesmeric and telepathic experi
ments all prove that there are forces
working that are unknown to science.
These forces come from the unseen world
that Is about us. That there are things
within range of our siKht but we arÂ« un
able to see them has often been shown, by
the camera. The sensitive plate has often
received impressions of objects that were
not visible to the eye. They were close
enough to us. however, to leave the lm
presslon on the plate."

"I finally learned bow to make Postum
bo well by letting it boil long enough that
it tasted as good as fine Java coffee, and
from that time on I have never had any
desire to go back to coffee. I am now
well, and there Is no question but that
my recovery Is due entirely to the Jeav-
lng off of coffee and using Postum Food
Coffee- .__.
"I began to recover very quickly, but
like lots of coffee and tobacco slaves, I
thought I would like to try the coffee
arain, so I started in on it and the old
trouble came on. I stopped again and
â¢went to Postum and began to Improve in
health. I did this foolish thing three dif-
ferent times, and each time that I would
go back to coffee I would run down In
health and was threatened with the same
old troubles. .
"A friend told me my trouble was cof-
fee; I didn't believe It. but for some rea-
son I concluded to stop drinking coffee
and try the Postum Food Coffee that had
been 6O highly recommended. I was
greatly astonished to find that In a few
days I had no more of the nervous spells
at breakfast and began to eat food of
most any and every kind.
"I wouM frequently have to run to the
door for breath, feeMr.g: as though I would
faint away. I pot co I could scarcely sit
up to eat tty little breakfast. So it went
on until I ran into nervous prostration
completely. Nothing would stay on' my
stomach. I called In physicians, who told
mÂ« I must travel, and gave but little en-
couragement of getting well.
"I knew the coffee was hurting- me, but
I did not seem to be able to take anything
else. Just the minute I took a swallow of
coffee my nerves would be^in to tingle,
a weak, faint sensation would run all
over my body, my wrists burning and
aching, the back of my neck hurting 1 , un-
til it finally got so bad that I would have
to hold my head on my hand while drink-
ing my cup of coffee.
Mrs. J. W. Grant of Deep-water, Mo.,
Â¦writes Interestingly of her experience
v.ith coffee. "AJter using coffee a num-
ber of years and gradually falling in
health. I got eo I cotild eat but very little
breakfast at ' any time and many days
could not eat at all. I would drink a cup
of coffee and try to eat a little bread.
There are rreat nnmbers of hlgWy or-
ranirea people upon whom coffee acts as
a dearly defined poison. In somo ex-
treme cases tha poisonous effects will
show Tn from three to five mlnutee, In
other cases a long time Is requlrr d, and In
eome cases the body can stand the effects
for years, but the effects are very uure,
and n-any times result In a fixed condi-
tion of organic disease that la difficult or
Impossible to be rid of.

The last series was between Buta and
Rosenfeld. Rosenfeld Is a young and
sturdy player, but was out of the going
with Butz. who is noted for his heavy
strength and "ball-soaking" ability. The
were sadly disappointed, as both Bowman
and Newman were all out of physical
strength and endurance.
Walsh and Duffy were the next two
players to enter the court. Duffy won
both games easily. Walsh scored 10 in the
first and 12 in the second. James had an
easy victory over Crable. The former won
both games. Cra.ble scoring 6 and 10
points, respectively. Cartwright beat
Kennedy two straight. In the first game
Kennedy w.-><< Â«savpd from a goose-eeg de
feat by scoring a single point. He showed
improvement m the second game, how
ever, and scored 9. It was clearly demon
strated that Kennedy was no match for
Cartwright.

latter ajso had the advantage over Rosen
feld by being a hard server. With few ex
ceptions was Rosenfeld able to return the
ball. Butz is a trifle overweight, and un
less able .to get In bettor condition toward
th8 close of the series he certainly will
not be inside the money, so say the wise
ones. The spectators in the gallery per
petrated a Joph on Butz during the last
game. One by one they silently left the
gallery, and when Butz looked upward to
receive his well earned applause he gazed
on empty benches.

Of all the matches the first, that be

most applause and proved the most ex
citing to the gallery. Newman won the
first game by a score of 21 to 15. The sec
ond was won by Bowman â 21 to 16. In the
last game Bowman was exhausted, and
the best he could do was to make five
points. Judging from the play the two
men put up in the early part of the con
test the spectators expected to see a de
termined struggle in the final, but they
in the gallery and on the courts
to see the games for the championship of
the second class.

would have been stopped at Columbus
if it had not been declared illegal in the
Cincinnati courts. The only qupstion here
now about the fight among the agitators
is as to the time when the Saengerfest

LIVERMORE, Jan. 13.â The application

If I were writing- a series of twenty pa
pers I might go on to refer to hundreds
more of allusions In Shakespeare to mat
ters connected with home life, school life,
frames, sports, holidays and festivals,
folk-lore and superstitions, and so on; but
the few random illustrations I have given
may serve to show the student to what a
field of research and entertainment tha
drafnatist thus Invites him. and he mav
bo led to explore It at leisure for himself.
W. J. KORFE.
Cambridge, Mass.
In "The Taming of tho Shrew.," Gnimio
says to the hungry Kate, "What say you
to a piece of beef and mustard?" ana In
the "Midsummer NlKht's Dream," Bot
tom says to Mustardseed. "I know your
patience well: that same cowardly, giant
like ox-beef hath devoured many a gen
tleman of your house." This association
of mustard with roast beef persists to
day. It is curious that It has disappeared
in this country, though we still use mus
tard with corned beef. In traveling on
the continent the Question has sometimes
been raised at the dinner table whether
a person sitting near by was English or
American. If he takes mustard with tho
roast beef -we have no further doubt as
to his nationality. . Tho association of
capers with boiled mutton also dates back
to the days of Shakespeare. In "Twelfth
Night," Sir Andrew says, "Faith, I can
cut a caper"; and Tobey replies, "And I
can cut the mutton to't." So with roast
goose and apple sauce. In "Romeo and
Juliet,'* Mercutlo says to Romeo, "Thy
wit is a very bitter sweeting: it is a most
sharp sance 1 "; and his friend retorts. "And
it is well served in to a sweet goose." Tho
"sweeting" is one of several varieties of
apple mentioned by' Shakespeare, and
some of them are known to-day In War
wickshire by the same names.
Beef and beer were typical of English
life then as now. The food of the com
mon peoole was better In tome respects
than It is at present, and better than It
was In continental countries. Travelers
who visited England often commented
upon this; just as tha Frenchmen in.
Shakespeare's plays refer to thÂ© "great
meals of beef of the English soldiers.
who "eat like wolves and fight like
devils," as the Constable says In "Henry
V." Aye." replies Orleans, "but these
Rnjdlsh are shrewdly out of beef." "Then
shall we find to-morrow," says the Con
stable, "they have only stomachs to eat
and none to fight."
That is, swear like a lady and not llko
the wife of a London tradesman. Tha
time here Is that of Henry IV, but the
manners, as In all the historical plays, are
those of the dramatist's own day.
We "need not be surprised that ladies
could indulge In profanity when Queen
Bess had set the example, but it Is never
theless amusing that Shakespeare makes
Hotspur ridicule his wife for her mild at
tempts In that line. When ho says.
"Come. Kate. I'll have your song, too."
and she answers, "Not mine. In good
sooth," Hotspur exclaims:
"Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you
swear like a com9t maker's wife 'Not
you. In good sooth,' and 'As true as I live,'
and 'As God shall mend me,' and 'As sure
as day,'
And givest such sarcenet surety far thy oaths.
As If thou never walk'st further than Fln3bury.
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art.
A good, mouth-ninn* oath, and leavÂ» "la
sooth"
And such protest of pepper- gingerbread
To velvet-guards ana Sunday-citizens.
Apropos of women", their manners in
that good old 'time were sometimes not
what would now be regarded as ladylike.
In the "Midsummer Night's Dream,"
when Helena and Hermia are quarreling
and the former has called the latter "Pup
pet." Hermia, who la short of stature, re
plies:
Puppet T Why so? AyÂ«, that way goes the
same.
How low am I, thoa painted maypole? Speak:
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach Into thine eyes.
And In "2 Henry VI" the Duchess of
Gloucester, when Queen Margaret boxes
her ears, mixes a touch of slang with a
similar threat:
Could I come near your beauty with, my nails
I'd set my ten commandments In your face!
There is a suggestion of the same sort
of feminine pugnacity in "The Two Gen
tlemen of Verona." where the gentle Julia
addresses the picture of Sylvia, which
that lady has sent to Proteus, thus:
I'll cse thee kindly for thy mistress* sake.
That used me so; or else, by Jove, I vow.
I should have scratched cut your unseeing eyes.
To jnake my master out of love with thee. _
been a proverbial expression: "Black men
arÂ« pearls in beauteous ladles' eyes." This
does not refer to negroes, though in a cer
tain book of Shakespeare quotations It is
put under that head in the classification.
Men might be swarthy and yet comely:
but not so with women. The favorite
type of feminine beauty was the blonde;
brunettes were not in favor. As Shakes
peare says In the one hundred ami twen
ty-seventh sonnet. "In the old age black
was not counted fair." lie says "the old
ege" because he is addressing "the dark
lady" of that group of poems, and he goes
on with an elaborate plea for her claim to
beauty in spite of her complexion. Later,
In a different mood, he calls her "a woman
color'd 111." So, in "Love's Labor'n Lost."
BIren, who has fallen In love with the
dark Rosaline, defends her against hl3
fellow lords, who sneer at her pretensions
to beauty, and declares that "no face is
fair that Is not full so black." Earlier in
the play, when he is chiding himself after
the manner of Benedick for treachery to
bachelorhood, he describes the lady as â
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow
And two pltchtalls stuck In her face for eye*.
AH the references to black eyes In the
plays are in a similar vein.

Space would fail me even to give with
out comment a list of Shakespeare's many
references to male and female apparel
which throw much light, on the fashions
of the time. I may, nowever, call the at
tention of feminine readers and students
to a scene (111., 4) In "Much Ado About
Nothing," in which Margaret and HÂ«ro
are discussing the wedding trousseau of
the latter. It is too long to quote and there
are things in it which the critics cannot
agree in explaining. One touch shows that
human nature, or woman nature, was the
same Â¦ then as now. Margaret refers to
"the Duchess of Milan's gown that they
praise so," and Hero replies, 'Oh. that ex
ceeds, they say." The costume of a lady
of rank and fashion was matter of gos
sip In that day. It would appear. Margaret
adds:" "By my troth, its but a night
gown in respect of vours. â¢ â¢ â¢ For a
quaint, graceful anil excellent fashion
yours is worth ten on *t.V It should be)
understood that "nlsthtgown" here, as
elsewhere in Shakespeare, means a dregs-
Ing gown or robe de chambre. Night
gowns In the modern sense had not then
come Into. use. " r
The aping of foreign fashions was com
mon then, especially with men who had
traveled, and Shakespeare has more than
one hit at the affectationâ as. to give a
single instance, in Portia's description of
the Englishman among her suitors: "How
oddly he is suited! I think he bought his
doublet in Italy, his round hose In France,
his bonnet In Germany and his behavior
1 1 1 1 j mill i ii "iHwtn/Mifi ntuBntaw it* ji-ai
When Julia. In a passage quoted above,
calls herself "black" Lit should be under
stood that she meant only sunburned or
somewhat dark' in complexion. In the
same play " we have what seems to - have
In "Troilus and Cresslda" the heroine
speaks of "my mask to defend my beau
ty": and the same practice is alluded to
in "Cymbellne" and "The Winter's Tale."
Black masks were worn by ladles at the
theater. In "Measure Tor Measure" Ange
lo has an eye to the audience In saying:
As these black masks
Proclaim an enshleld beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could dlsplay'd;
and so does Romeo when he says:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladiea' brwwa
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair.
And the disguised Julia, In Th* Two
Gentlemen of Verona." tells how "at Pen
tecost" in a play on the classical story
of Theseus and Ariadne, she took "the
woman's part." She soeaks as a boy, and
this reminds us of sundry allusions In the
plays to the fact that in Shakespeare's
day female parts were still played by
boys or young men. In the epilogue to
"As You Like It" the youth who, after
personating Rosalind, appears in his true
masculine character, could say, "If I
were a woman I would kiss as many of
you as had beards that pleased me": but
when Modieska recited this epilogue It
was a mistake, as I told her vnen I met
her afterward, and later sha made a
slight change in the passage 10 avoid the
inconsistency- .^...
Cleopatra, anticipating the possibility of
being carried captive to Rome, says: Â¦

Quince tells Flute that he ' can play
Thisbe "in a mask": and not to dwell
longer on Shakespeare's countless refer
ences to theatrical matters, on which a
-volume might be written, tho au-geation
of Quince reminds us that ladies In th^
days of Elizabeth wore masks to protect
their complexion. Julia, as a page, when
describing her. real self to Sylvia, says
("Two Gentlemen of Verona"):
When she did think my master lored her well.
She In my Judgment, was as fair as you.
But elnce she did neglect her looklnt;-Â«;lasÂ«
And threw her sun-expellltiK mask away.
The air*hath starved the rrmea in her cheeka.
And plncheil the lily-tincture of her face,
And now she is become as black as I. ,
The .historians of the Elizabethan age
tell us little about the everyday life of
the time and we find slight information
on the subject in contemporaneous writers
except the dramatists, Shakespeare in
particular. He was familiar with life In
both country and city and " among all
classes from peasant to noble, and, in a
measure, even to royalty itself. About
half of his life, including the first twenty
years or more and the last five or six,
was passed In Stratford, and the rest in
London, where he became a favorite in
literary and polite circles, was patronized
by -the nobility, and received many marks
of favor from Elizabeth and James.
His works abound in allusions to every
phase of life, whether in nature or in
man, which 'passed before his eyes or
came to his knowledge. Naturally he was
keenly interested in his own art, , which
in his boyhood was entering upon a new
and Important stage In its development.
It was not until 1580, when he was 14 years
of age, that the old religious plays at
Coventry were finally suppressed, and he
may have been an eyewitness of the lat
ent of them. He must have heard about
them if he did not see them, for he has
not a few allusions to them in his plays.
He knew how King Herod used to blus
ter and rag-e on the boards of the theaters
on wheels which were drawn about the
streets of Coventry "for the better ad
vantage of the spectators," as the ver
acious Dugdale relates: and the royal
bully recurred -to his memory when he
made Hamlet say of similar extravagance
in later times, "It out-Herods Herod,"
and when Mistress Page, after reading
Falstaft's boast that, like a true knight,
he will fight for her love, exclaims,
"What a Herod of Jewry is this!" The
buffoon, or Vice of the ancient moralities,
is recalled In the clown's song in "Twelfth
Night": â¢
, I am cone, sir.
And anon, sir,
I'll be with you again.
In a. trice.
Like to tha old Vice.
Ton need to sustain;
Who, with dagger of lath,
In hii rase and his wrath.
Cries Ah. ha! to the derrtlt
Like a mad lad. â¢
Pare thy nails, dad!
Adieu, woodman drivel.
So Shallow is compared to a "Vice's
dagger" in "2 Henry IV," and the char
acter is also referred to in "1 Henry Iv,
"Richard HI" and "Hamlet." The "lost
souls," who, dressed in black or black
and yellow, figured In scenes of the last
Judgment, appear In "Henry V." where
the flea on Bardolph's rubicund nose Is
compared to "A black soul burning In
hell fire."
The historical pageants, not based on
biblical subjects, that were familiar to tha
food people of Coventry a century before
hakespeare was born were also known to
him when, in his first wholly original play;
"Love's Labor's Xiost." he Introduced the
burlesque of "The Nine Worthies." The
original text of the drama on the same
popular theme, which had been performed
at Coventry before Henry VI. In 1435. is
still extant and portions of Shakespeare's
travesty seem almost like a parody of it.
Whether. the dramatist actually saw any
of the Coventry moralities or not, he must
often have witnessed the theatrical per
formances associated with the rural fes
tivities of Whitsuntide. Perdita. in "The
Winter's Tale," when distributing her
flowers at the shepherds' feast, says:
Methinks I play as I havÂ« seen them do
In Whitsim pastorals.

Though the delegates to the Republican
and Democratic conventions have been
elected it will be two weeks before these
conventions are held. During this inter
val there will be plenty of time for the
delegates to discuss possibilities and can
didates.
The executive committee of the Munici
pal League held a meeting last night and
there was a great deal of discussion over
future movements of the organization.
There is an element In the league that id
trying to prevent the Republican Commit
tee of Twenty-one from swallowing the
league and there are some members of the
league who are in favor of the committee
of twenty-one. While* Ihe Republicans and
Democrats had no contests in their ranks
the Municipal League seems to be the
storm center of all political activity..
The executive committee finally decided
to refer all matters to the full league meet
ing, which takes place to-morrow evening,
when the date of the primaries and the
convention will be determined upon and
the official list of delegates announced.
This meeting is bound to be exciting be
cause of the two elements that are seek
ing for control.
Many names have been mentioned for
different nominations, but there are few
declared candidates for any particular of
fflce. â¢ :Â¦-..Â» â¢.-Â». .
The only recent declaration that has
been made is that of Councilman B. C.
Cuvellier, " who wants to be re-elected.
Mr. Cuvellier had declared himself as an

ination from the Third Ward, but to-day
he said that hÂ« would be a condidate for
Councilman at large. George i-itzgerald
is likely to be the nominee of the commit
tee of twenty-eight and Mr. Cuvellier will
take his chances at large in preference to
a fight with Fitzgerald.
For Mayor the names of the following
have been mentioned in connection with
the nomination of the committee of twen

years of age, plain of features, bearing
marks of illness upon her drawn and
pinched countenance. She was decently
but plainly clad.
John McConahy, of 622*Â£ Grove street,
San Francisco, called at the Receiving
Hospital this evening and identified the
woman as his wife. He said that she had
had a suicidal tendency for some time.
She left her home this morning and had

ley as the steamer was entering
the Blip at 9:30 o'clock this morning' at

of committing suicide. Just before the
despondent woman sank from sight she
Bcreamed, attracting the attention of
deckhands on the ferryboat Piedmont, ly
ing In the inside slip.. A boat was quickly
lowered and the rescuers reached the
drowning woman just in time to save her
from the death she courted.
The woman was unco'nscious when the
deckhands carried her into the depot. She
was wrapped In blankets and put aboard
the Alameda local train and taken to First
Ftreet and Broadway. Prom there-Police
man Andrews and Detective Shorey hast
ened with her to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Stratton and Assistant James Page
after an hour's effort succeeded in restor
ing the woman to consciousness, though
the doctors thought she had suffered a
severe congestion of the lungs and that
her condition was serious.
As soon as the woman had revived, ef
forts were made by the hospital staff to
l^arn her identity and the cause for the
deed. To all inquiries the patient was
evasive. At the outset she said her name
was Mar>* Dixon. that she was the wife
of a carpenter residing on Grove street,
San Francisco. Subsequently .she declared
that Dixon was an assumed name used to
throw any inquirers off the track.
"It would kill my husband and child If
they knew what I have done," she burst
out suddenly, and then as suddenly re
lapsed into sphinxllke silence.
The only evidence that would lead to
the solution of the mystery was in a postal
card, found in her clothing. The dimmed
and blurred superscription read so far as
could be deciphered, "Mr. John McConahy,

the reverse side was the following::

Early Closing Cards Received.
The early closing movement by which
the retail clerks have succeeded In induc
ing the storekeepers to comply with the
popular demand for the closing of all
stores at 6 o'clock, has gained an addi
tional impetus by the reception In this
city of union store cards from the Retail
Clerks' Association In Denver. The dis
tribution of these cards will be taken in
hand by the local union in this city and
placed in the store windows of such stores
as conform to the rule of closing at 6
o'clock in the evening.
No cards will be placed in windows of
storekeepers who have declined to accede
to the early closing movement. The clerks
have thirty committees at work agitating
their cause before trades unions and fra
ternal societies. By this and other meth
ods they expect to educate the public to
purchase durins the daytime.

"A Stranger in a Strange Land."

a reminiscence of "The Man from Mex

"A Stranger iii a Strange City "a- Queer Patchwork.
Last Week of "Nell Gwynne" at Meazar.
Professor Jordan, in opening his address,
dwelt upon the manner of university edu
cation as it existed in England thirty
years ago. At that time, Latin, Greek
and mathematics were thought to be the
essentials of a university training and
when Spencer wrote -a learned essay on
the true worth of education It startled the
schoolmen of the day, for there were but
few teachers. The ideas of Spencer set
men to thinking,- and from that time
many'benencial changes had been effect
ed. The English universities were gov
erned by tradition, and to have a uni
versity training was a class distinction.
There was a certain distinction about
a woman who was "well dressed," al
though her apparel might not be costly,
the speaker said. So it was with a man
who had secured the title of A. B. in
Kngland. It gave him a defined standing.
Men studied certain things at Oxford and
Cumbridge because it was a tradition to
do so. It was once said that there were
two classes at the English universities;
the men and the scholars. The men Â¦were
not- scholars andx the scholars were not
men. Huxley and Tyndall were self-made
men, for they were not graduates of the
colleges of England. Self-made men
might achieve gTeater things if they had
the advantages of college education, and
English literature and science had suf
fered on account of the class distinction
shutting out men who afterward had won
fame.
Professor Jordan then explained the es
say of Spencer in which the writer denned
the branches of valuable education and
took up each of the Spencerian heads
separately.
In continuing. Professor Jordan said:
Spencer says that college education has a
value in life. Some knowledge has value and
some has not, while some information has no
value whatever! People spend too much of
tlieir time In securing definitions. To memor
iae the results of investigation is not worth as
much as making an investigation for yourself.
Spencer speaks of five lines of educational
value in life. The first Is the scientific knowl
edge dfalinj? with success in life. A success
ful life means an abundant life, and no life
can be successful without an abundance of
Kalth and morality. A sound body means a
scund life; unsound morals mean an unsound
body. ; The I human body is a. mere machine,
therefore the study or physiology is valuable.
Tc learn the mere structural parts of the hu
man machinery is not enough; we must learn
how to run the machine.
For instance, you may study the nervous
system, but knowledge will teach you how
beneficial temperance Is for that system. There
Ik no such thing as vice, for vice is but the
effort to get happiness without earning it.
The second and third lines laid down by
Spencer are those of education. This will teach
one his relative part In the world. Every man
should know a skilled trade, for there are hard
times ahead for the unskilled man. Andrew
Carnegie once told me that he owed his suc
cess in business to the fact that he secured the
services of the most skillful chemists, who en
abled him to manufacture steel on scientific
principles. Education means everything, and
the most Important thing to do is to educate
the children. Fit them for their work in life.
How glorious It would be if the present genera
tion would quit politics and money making and
devote Itself to the education of the children.
The world would Jump one hundred, aye one
thousand' years ahead. We would be rid of
the saloons, vice and crime, fourth cate
gory of Spencer's essay is. that of man's rela
tion to society. Social and political duties are
most Important ones and should never be neg
lected. - Democracy Is an educational growth.
When men are capable and eelf-thlnkingr It
rhows that they have advanced in education.
It has been said that the mob makes the king.
This is true also, for if no mob existed it
would not need a king.
I come now to the fifth category of Spencer,
which consists of the Joys of life. These joys
are ' art, poetry, music, literature and love of
nature. These are the bright flowers on the
tree of education. There are many means of.
securing a higher education and enjoying the
beauties of this fifth category. Education con
sists of real knowledge of ourselves and the
real knowledge of things in nature. A great
deal of good Is accomplished in spending a few
years at the universities, but to simply learn
Latin and Greek Is not real education. Thirty
years | ago. the colleges of America were as
narrow as those of England were. They did
not teach real knowledge. In the last twenty
years however, a great change has taken
place Colleges of agriculture and mechanical
arts sprung up all over the country and one
of the greatest advantages enjoyed by Cali
fornia Is due to the joining of the State Uni
versity and the mechanical college. Each class
of students and teachers has been benefited.
As Aggaslz once said. "A thorough education
consists In the thorough knowledge of some
thing " " This thorough knowledge of some
thing forms the backbone of real education.
The value of teaching was of vital Importance.
Emerson said. "It all lies with whom your
teacher Is." -It is far better to study one thing
with a good professor than to study many
things with a. poor one. A good teacher Is
bound to leave his mark. That is why univer
sities are always eager to gather together
great teachers. President Eliot of Harvard
has done more for â¢ education in this respect
than any other man In America. His aim has
always been to make college men and not col
lege students. He believed In the work- of
constructive individualism, i In England the
aim of the universities Is to make men Â¦gen
tlemen," well bred in every respect. Germany's
ideas are to do the work of the college In a
thorough manner, leaving the well breeding out
of the question. I have known professors in
Germany who have had the manners of bears.
The colleges In America are . doing the work
done In English and Gorman universities; they
are producing gentlemen, scholars and men of
force. In the old days, the colleges only ad
mitted a certain class of men, there was but
one door and It was a narrow one. To-day in
America we have many doors to our colleges
and they are of wide dimensions. â¢ They let In
Â¦ all men who want to study all kinds of things.
Our colleges are brave, broad and free.
In closing* his masterly address, Pro
fessor Jordan explained the workings in
the German universities of "lehrfrelheit"
and 'iernfreiheit"; the freedom of the stu
dent to select any class of study., he de
sired and the equal liberty of the profes
sor to teach without being bound down
by any set of rules or authorities. ; o
"This," said Professor Jordan, 'is true
of every American college to-day."
At the close of the regular service, con
ducted by the Rev. Bradford Leavitt, the
speaker of the evening was introduced by
the pastor.
The vast edifice was crowded to the
doors and the representative congrega
tion listened to the words of the academic
teacher with profound interest.
An address on "Education" Â¦was deliv
ered, last -evening: at the First Unitarian
Church, Geary and Franklin streets, by-
Professor . David Starr Jordan of ' Stan
ford University, the address being one of
the series to be delivered on the subject
of "The Future of Our City and State."
