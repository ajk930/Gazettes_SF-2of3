WITH THE FILIPINO INSURGENTS
The- news of this incorporation, which
s was accompanied by the news that it was
the filing of the papers of the steel trust
Itself, leached Wall street about the open
ing, of :the market and added to . the ex
citement . which followed upon the an
nouncement in this morning's papers, that
the' mammoth concern was soon to take'
corporate entity.
The incorporators were William J. Cur
tis, of the law firm of Sullivan & Crom
well; Charles MacVeagh, of the law firm
of Stetson, Jennings & Russell, and
Charles C. Cluff, general Eastern agent
of the Illinois Steel Company, one of the
companies owned by the Federal Steel
Company, which is to go into the new
trust. Each of these Incorporators is the
owner of five shares of preferred stock
and five shares of common stock.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â In the office of
the Secretary of State in Trenton, N.J.,
incorporation papers of the new blllion
dollar steel trust; which is J. P. Mor
gan's greatest achievementâ the United
States Steel Corporationâ were filed this
morning. The capital was placed at the
nominal sum. of $3000. and will be In
creased, as stated to-day, to $400,000,000 of
common and $400,000,000 of preferred stock,
besides which there will be a $400,000,000
5 per cent bond issue. The capital so far
consists of fifteen shares of 7 per cent
cumulative stock and fifteen shares of
common stock, each of the par value of
$ioo. iSi'i *;v^
thirds. This agreement has not been rati
fied.
Foreign Minister Delcasse, replying to
ex-Minister Guerln in the Senate to-day,
said that the bondholders had been de
prived of their rights in an arbitrary man
ner and contrary to every precedent. Por
tugal's attitude, which it is difficult to un
derstand, has created an unpleasant im
pression in Germany, Great Britain, Bel
gium and France.
The French Government, M. Delcasse
added, had protested, and Portugal had
replied that she regretted the situation,
but the condition of her treasury, which
was under temporary difficulties, made It
her duty not to ratify the interest agree-
ment at present. It was hoped that the
country's finances^ would soon Improve
and that the negotiations could be re
opened.
M. Delcasse finally declared that the
Government would never allow the inter
ests of the bondholders again to be en
croached upon. He intended to compel
Portugal to repeal her measures of spolia
tion. Nobody in Lisbon was Ignorant of
the fact that the French had means to
mrke themselves heard, and he would not
hesitate to use these means if It became
necessary.
The Senate adopted a resolution declar
ing that it relied upon the Government to
safeguard French capital in Portugal.
KEW TORK. Feb. -23.â A Eun special
from Perls says: Considerable alarm and
Indignation havÂ« been created In France
by the failure of Portugal to comply with
hÂ«r agreement reepeqting the payment of
Interest oa her foreign debt, which
amounts to 1,00,000,000 francs. Of this
amount the French Investors hold S0O.0O0.
009 francs, nominally representing 600,000,000
francs paid up. A majority of the holders
are email capitalists.
In 'lSSZ Portugal suddenly reduced the
Interest by two-thirds. The French Gov
err.raent energetically protested, and the
regbtlations resulted in Portugal promis
ing gradually to raise the interest to two-
The objects for which the corporation Is
formed . are to manufacture iron, steel,
manganese, coke, copper, lumber and
other materials, and all or any articles
consisting or partly consisting of iron,
steel, copper, wood or other materials, and
all or any productsMhereof. To acquire,
own, lease, occupy, use or develop any
lands containing coal or iron, manganese,
stone or ores or. oil. or any wood lands or
other lands for any purpose ol the com
pany. To mine or otherwise extract or re
move coal. ores, stone and other materials
and timber from any lands owned, ac
quired; leased or occupied by the company,
or from any other lands. To buy and to
otherwise deal in traffic in iron, steel,
manganese, copper, stone, ores. coal. coke,
wood,; lumber and other materials, and
any of the ! products thereof j and . any ar
ticle consisting or partly consisting

The articles of incorporation set forth
that the location of the principal offices in
the State of New Jersey Is at 51 Newark
street, Hoboken. The name of the agent
there, upon whom . process against the
corporation may be served, Is the Hudson
Trust Company.
There was a wild scramble to buy when
the^ market opened. The day's transac
tion's In steel stocks were notable not only
for extent, but for the way in which
prices varied. The fact that the payment
in the new trust stock is very different
from payment in cash did not take long
to draw, on margin traders, and fluctua
tions were rapid under the conflicting con
victions which pervaded the street as to
the real future values of the securities.

ated. He added that the Russian Govern
ment gives verbal assurances that the
agreement was of a temporary and pro

Lord George Hamilton, the Indian Sac

the looting at Peking, replied that the

to loot. Stringent measures had been
taken. Certain articles of value which
had been left in the Summer Palace after

session of the British, and they would be
restored to the Cldnese when peace was

to the horrible deed rushed to where the
body lay.
The woman was beyond human aid. She
lay huddled in a white heapâ her brains
dashed outâ a mass of bruised and broken
flesh and bones. It was the pitiful and ter
rible ending of a life wasted in the ten
derloin.
The woman was well known in the
red-light district. Her name among
the habitues of tire- saloons of the town
was Fannie Stewart, and her companions
called her "Chick." \ She - was 'formerly
the proprietress of a resort on Mason

dent which resulted in the loss of one
of her limbs.
Not long ago she was arrested on a
charge of robbery, the complainant being

dashed out on the pavement and the bones
of her body crushed.
At the hour named a hackman stand

at^ the third story of the hotel. At a
window there he saw a sight that seemed
to freeze his blood. A young woman, in
her nightclothes, was climbing out of tho
window. She deliberately crawled over
.the sill and hung there for a moment In
midair.
The hackman at last found his power
of speech and calling to several belated
pedestrians urged them to run up to the
floor of the hotel, where the room of the
young woman was located and save her
from the terrible d*ath she was seeking.
The ; horrified spectators dashed Into

frantically imploring the woman to "hold

whether a State law is sufficient to per
mit an alien to inherit property in cases
In which the alien Is a resident of a coun
try with which there Is no treaty covering
the question. The court, however, did not
enter upon the discussion of this conten
tion, but dismissed the case with the re
mark that the petition was frivolous, be
t cause evidently filed for delay. The case

Diamondville Coal Mine in

. a Terrible Disaster.
KEMMERER, Wyo., Feb. 25.
â A disastrous fire in the
Diamondville coal mine No.
1 late this evening was attended
with serious loss of life and great
destruction of property. There
were some fifty miners and fifteen
horses entombed. One miracu
lous escape was made by John
Anderson, who was working near
the mouth of the level. When he
realized the mine was on fire he
with some difficulty reached the
main lead and by throwing a
heavy overcoat over his head and
shoulders he pushed his way
through the flames and reached
the main lead completely ex
hausted and terribly burned. He
will recover. He was taken out
by friends.
All efforts to succor those far
ther back have failed, as the
flames drove the rescuers back.
That all have perished is with
out question." The scenes around
the mine were heartrending.
Mothers, wives and sweethearts
wept and tore their hair, in terri
ble agony,and aJJ;' efforts to calm
them proved of no avail. : V
The loss of property will reach
an enormous figure and as the of
ficials Â»are very reticent, the
amount and names of those im
prisoned are unobtainable at a
late hour. The cause of the fire
is at present unknown. The mine
has been plugged at the sixth
level, about two miles from the
mouth.

W., -WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â Forsaken
by, his attorney, Robert Burton Rodney,
retired paymaster of the navy, appeared
in his own behalf to-day before Justice
Hagner to show cause why he should not
be committed to Jail for' contempt of
court in refusing to pay his wife alimony.
His explanation of the reason of delay
and his plea for leniency seemed to irri
tate Justice Hagner, who overruled his
answer and issued an order for him to
pay by March 1, or falling to do so to be
confined in the District Jail until he com
piled with the order of. court-
Before closing the case Paymaster Rod
ney, who is over 50 years of age, wasÂ»
given some sound advice by Justice Hag
ner. He told him that no one had com
pelled him to marry his wife, and now
that he had done so he must support her.
Paymaster Rodney's plea for more time
was that he had to pay interest on a
note on the 1st of March, and that it was
a debt of honor.
"What do. you call this?" asked Justice
Hagner. "Isn't alimony a debt of honor?"
Mrs. Rodney was not in court. Her
husband is still searching for her nnd has
not yet given up hope of finding her.

STAGE PLUNGES
INTO THE YUKON
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â The House to
day Jettisoned., the authorization for. two
battleships and two cruisers which was In
the. naval appropriation bill as it passed
that body. The Senate had requested the
proposition, and against the appeals of
the House conferees" the House to-day
voted by, a big majority, to agree to the
Senate amendment striking - out i the
authorizations. Chairman Cannon of the
Appropriations : â¢ Committee ' contributed
largely to this result by a vigorous speech
In favor of the Senate amendment. A
partial conference report on the naval ap
propriation bill was agreed to, and the
bill went back to conference. The House
also agreed to the conference report on
the bill to create a commission of five to
adjudicate the claims of United States cit
izens against Spain assumed by the
United States under the treaty of Paris.
The House entered upon the last week
of the session with a full attendance of
members on the floor and throngs of spec
tators In the galleries. Dayton of West
Virginia called up the conference report
upon the naval appropriation bill.
It was only a partial report, agreeing
to about two-thirds of the Items in dis
pute between the two houses. The con
ference report was adopted.
Rixey of Virginia then moved that the
House recede and concur in the Senate
amendment striking out the provision for
two battleships and two cruisers.
Pending action upon this motion the-
Senate amendments were nonconcured
In. It was arranged that there should be
an hour of debate on each side upon the
Rlxey motion. Dayton vigorously opposed
It. He contended that to strike out the
authorization for new ships would check
the building up of the navy and open up
a long controversy over the various types
of ships*, armor plate, etc.
Rixey argued that the Senate's proposi
tion was eminently fair. It simply pro
posed to postpone the building of new
shlRs until the next session of CongTess
and that In the meantime Congress could
be informed upon the questions as to
whether ships should be sheathed or not.
as to the thickness of armor and kindred
subjects. He said the shipyards tnrough
out the country were already fuii of work
on warships.
Dayton answered that he had in his
pocket a telegram from the great ship
yards in Rixey's own' State saying they
could build four more Bhlps, while a dis
patch from the Union Iron "Works stated
they could build Beveral more vessels.
After some further debate by Hopkins
of Illinois, Vandiver of Missouri. Kitchen
of North Carolina. King of Utah and
Drlggs of New York in favor of the mo
tion, and Mudd of Maryland, Brown of
Ohio. Adams of /Pennsylvania, Wheeler
of Kentucky. Cummings of New York,
who came on the floor on- crutches to
speak, and Watson of Indiana against it.
Cannon .closed the debate in support of
the motion. He Bald the real question was
whether, from the standpoint of the treas
ury, of the public defense and of sound
business principles, It was not time to call
a halt for a year in the authorization of
new ships. There were In the navy, he
paid. 254 warships and fifty-six auxiliary
vessels. There was still to be paid upon
ships building and authorized $65,000,000.
When our navy was completed, he said,
America would have the greatest navy in
the world save that of England. England
was no menace, because Canada, with
2000 miles of territory on our northern
border, was a hostage against war with
Great Britain. (Applause.)
The Rlxey motion was carriedâ 158 to 88.
The bill was then sent back to conference.
. Haugen of Iowa called up the confer
ence report upon the bill to create a com
mission of five members to adjudicate the
claims of United States citizens against
Spain assumed by the United States un
der the terms of the treaty of Paris, and
it was agreed to, 134 to 84. notwithstand

that the House had twice voted that
these claims should be adjudicated by the

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â A decision
was rendered to-day in the United States
Supreme Court in. the cases of Fred Lee
Rice, Frank Rutledge and Thomas Jones,
holding that they were subject to extra
dition to Canada, The case has attracted
considerable discussion, because it raised
an international question. The three men
were arrested in Chicago as fugitives from
Justice for otTehses committed in Ontario,
Canada, and upon an effort being made
to extradite them they sought to secure
a writ of habeas corpus from the District
Court of the United States of the North
ern District of Illinois, on the ground that
the United States Commissioners who
heard their cases had received them upon
information and that this proceeding was
not justifiable in an extradition case. The
court held against the petitioners on the
ground that while one count of the com
plaint was upon information and belief
only, the other three were made upon the
knowledge of a Canadian officer, and
these were competent to Justify extradi
tion.
Justice Brown, who delivered the opin
ion of the court, said: "We do not wish
to be understood as holding that in ex
tradition proceedings the complaint must
be sworn to by persons having actual
knowledge of the offense charged. This
would defeat the whole object of the
treaty, as we are bound to assume that
no foreign government possesses greater
power than our own to order its citizens
to go to another country to institute legal
proceedings. -'If the office of the foreign
government has no personal knowledge of
the facts he mav with entire propriety
make the complaint upon information and
belief, stating the sources of his informa
tion and the grounds of his belief and
annexing to the complaint a properly filed
copy df any indictment or equivalent pro
ceeding which may have been found in
the foreicn court of a copy of the depo
sitions of witnesses having actual knowl
edge of the facts."
The opinion of the Illinois District Court
was affirmed.

RIVERSIDE, Feb. 25.â The River
side Board of Education has
adopted plans for the new high
school building for which $40,000
was recently voted, and the
plans indicate a structure of a unique and
dlrtlnctlve type of architecture. The de
s'f.;n is a decidedly original one and is a
striking attempt to utilise the mission
style in a public building of this char
acter.
The plan generally consists of a central
octagonal assembly room eighty by eighty
feet, around which a corridor extends,
eight feet wide. Around this assembly
room are grouped three class rooms on
each of tho corners, or twelve in all.
twenty-four by thirty-two feet each. On
the main or north front is the principal
entrance or porch, and m. corridor fourteen
feet wide leads to the interior. On either
side are located the offices -of principal,
Superintendent and Trustees.
NO MORE NEW
SHIPS THIS YEAR
Breaking each side of the building-, are
large porches or arcades for the. pupils'
entrances; also a wide corridor from
which open the cloak rooms.
On- the south front is located the li
brary, thirty by fifty feet, which is twen
ty-four feet high, affording room for,fu
ture galleries. ' : t
The central features of each front are
two stories high, and are finished as lab
oratories and lecture rooms. From the
side porches are liberal entrances: to the
basement, which is ten feet high und
fitted with lavatories, wheel rooms, lunch
rooms and a kindergarten school room.
The assembly room is forty feet high and
finished with a paneled wood ceiling and
lighted from the roof, assuring the very
beat results both for light and ventilation.
The class rooms are fourteen feet high.
oo radical a design naturally invites
radical criticism, and it is not easy at first
to decide on its merits, but it is believed
that in every respect the building will
be found worthy of high praise.

ho statute prohibiting the intermarriage
of- Chinese and Caucasians. Being mar

According to the story told to Mr. Co-
Vern. they have been in love with each
ether a long time. When Mrs. Hull's hus-
Var.d clod i.n San Francisco a number of
.yt-ars a.go she had a call to preach the
<3oepcl to the heathen. She went into
Chinatown, where she met Chan Hon Fan.

cjueuoltfs and was a regularly, ordained
I'.iniFter of the Methodist Episcopal
'church. After trying- to get a license in
San Francisco, they decided Colorado
would afford them the relief sought. On
arriving here yesterday, they went first
io Sir.g Lee. a California-street laundry
ir.an. whom Chan Hon Fan had known
in San Francisco, and then to Dr. R. F.
Lrmond, a well-known physician, whom
they tr.et laÂ«t summer while they were
taking the children of their mission on
an excursion around the bay. Sing Lee

v.ith thc ; County Clerk and with the Rev.
Mf. Cobern, and there was no difficulty
in petting: a marriape license or a minister
to perform the ceremony.
T he couple djsappeared immediately aft
er bvlr.g married. Fan is about 25 years
old and his bride about 30.
â¢ Chan Han Fan is a Methodist minister
well known on the Pacific Coast through
his missionary labors among his owh
Â¦c-j-jutrympn. He came from China with
his parents while very young and has
lived in the West for more than thirty
>ears. He was one of the converts of the
celebrated Dr. Gibson, and at the age of
In rears was known as "the boy street
jreather."
The work of Rev. Chan Hon Fan has
been very successful and he has been
largely instrumental in bringing thousand*
of Chinese to Christianity. For the last
two yiars he has been preaching in Los

a Chinese mandarins daughter, who died

HONOLULU, Feb. 19.â At the meeting
of the Honolulu Ministerial Association
yesterday morning it was resolved to ap
ply to-morrow morning to Judge Hum
phreys, presiding in the Circuit Court of
the First Circuit, for a writ of injunction
against i the Joshiwara at Iwllei in the
Honolulu suburbs. This ia the place
where, since the plague fires destroyed
Chinatown and its institutions last year,
the Japanese abandoned women have
bten corralled, under police supervision
ind Board of Health inspection.
There are from one to twb hundred of
the Japanese and a dozer, or so of French
women in what the agitators against such
apparently legal sanction of the social
evil denominate "the slave pen." The
agitation has been maintained with mow
or less vigor intermittently ever since the
corral has been established. The Rev. \V.
K. Azbitl. formerly a missionary to Japun
from the Christian denomination, and
Professor Theodore rUchards, formerly
principal of Kamehameha School, havÂ«;
Deen the leaders in this emulation of
Parkhurst. LaUerly the Honolulu Pro
tective league was organized and re
vealed, as one of its objects, a campaign
agak.st the alleged slavery feature of me
establishment. This Lody, however, has
thus far done nothing. Within the past
tew weeks the whole aufstion has been
stirred up afresh by Misses Jessie Acker
man and Ada L. Murcutt, the widely
known traveling apostlis of the W. C. T.
U. They have visited the plac^; under es
cort of the High Sheriff, and upon the
Ftrength of their Â«nvcstlrations have
Mrathingly denounced tne authorities, both
from the public platform and through the
press, for not only tolerating but protect
ing the institution. It is doubtless owing
to the vigorous action of these visitors
that the Ministerial Association Is about
to appeal to the law for the suppression
of the JoÂ«hiwara. The preachers are plan
ning to take the authorities as well as the
public by surprise.
The Republican has been since its start
aiding the movement for the suppression
of lwilei, and as Judce Humphreys has
been the controlling owner of that paper
since before he went -Jixm the bench the
movers count upon at least a favorable
ear to th*lr petition to-morrow.
The first Legislature cf the Territory of
Hawaii is to open to-morrow. Governor
Dole's speech is, of course, being guarded
as strictly against premature publication
as the President's message to Con^res 1 ?.
His estimates are ready to lay before the
Legislature. It is not expected that these
will display any strenuous policy of econ
omy and retrenchment. W ith the excep
tion of the postal and customs services,
now in Federal hands, and for the first
time not having to be provided for out of
local resources, there will be just as large
an army of office-holders as ever, perhaps
Indeed even larger. When it is remem
bered that these excepted services had for
many years vielded a handsome surplus,
the Territorial burden of administration is
greater than before. There will be a shav
ing down of salaries of the four offices
corresponding to the former ministerial
ones, so as to make them bear due pro
portion to the reduced compensation of
officers now paid from the Federal treas
ury. This will be a cut in each case merely
from $6000 to $4500 a year.
â¢There will be three crand divisions of
matter for deliberation in the session.
Without regard to order of Importance
they are: The estimates or the appro
priation bills; taxation or providing of
, sufficient revenue to meet new conditions;
i municipal institutions or the provision oi
I independent town and city government:
i compensation for wrongs and misfortunes
deemed responsibilities of governments
; hitherto, such as those arising from in
surrection and pestilence; the temperance
question.
Taking these subjects In the order hero
given, the appropriations will certainly
form a lively issue. The Home Rulers aro
in the saddle and they may be depends
upon to lose no opportunity of making
the fact patent to the world. They repre
sent the old cry of "Hawaii for the Ha
wailans." Happy may the office-holder,
appointed by favor of those whom the Ha
walians blame for shutting them out of
lot or part in the government of tht'r
i own country for the past eleht years.
! count himself whose salary is not sun
! Jected to the pruning-knife or has not a
rider attached making the salary condi
tioned on some one else leeelving it. Then,
when it comes to logrolling for appropria
tions for different sections, the legislator
of Hawaii, white as well as foreign, will
belie his past if he do not help to mako
ducks and drakes of the most carefully
prepared estimates.

THE "SLAVE PEN"
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. â The Senate
Committee on Relations with Cuba has
agreed "to an amendment to the army
appropriation bill regarding Cuba. The
entire committee is in agreement, and
there will be no minority report, and no
opposition is expected from the Demo
crats In the Senate.' It Is the general im
pression that the agreement to-day makes
an extra session of Congress unnecessary.

cut, chairman of the Committee on Rela
tions with Cuba, reported the amendment
agreed: upon by the committee to be at
tached to the army appropriation bill.

tially as follows:
"Firstâ That the Government of Cuba
Bhall never enter into any treaty or other
compact with any foreign power or
powers which will imnair or tend to im

wise, lodgment in or control over any
poftion of said island.
"Secondâ That said Government shall
not assume or contract any public debt,
to pay the interest upon which and to
make reasonable sinking fund provision
for the ultimate discharge of which the
ordinary revenues of the islands, after de
fraying the current expenses of govern
ment, shall be inadequate.
"Thirdâ That the Government of Cuba
consents that the United States may ex
ercise the right to intervene for the
preservation of Cuban independence, the

to be mutually agreed upon, for the sani
tation of the cities of the island, to the
end that a recurrence of epidemics and
Infectious diseases may be prevented,
thereby assuring protection to the people
and commerce of Cuba, as well as to the
commerce of the Southern ports of the
United States and the people residing
therein.
,"6. ,That the Isle of Pines shall be omit
ted from the proposed constitutional
boundaries of Cuba, the title thereto being
left to future adjustment by treaty. . -
"7. That to enable the United States to
maintain the Independence of Cuba and
to protect the people thereof, as well/as
for its own defense, the Government of
Cuba will sell or lease to the United
States lands necessary for coaling or
naval stations at certain specified points,
to be agreed upon with the President of
the United States.
"3. That by way of further assurance,
the Government of Cuba will embody the
foregoing provisions in a permanent
treaty with the United States."
The amendment was referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs.
It can be stated on high authority that
the Cuban amendment to the army ap
propriation bill Is satisfactory to the
President, and thai Its adoption by Con
gress will avoid the necessity for an ex
tra session.

A House bill 'amending the act provid
ing a civil government for Porto Rico and
to increase the salary of the commissioner
of education of the island was called up
by Foraker. The Senate committee re*
ported a substitute for the House bill.
Foraker presented an amendment pro

the benefit of the island instead of being
paid first into the treasury of the United

While making eome Inquiries about the
bill Pettigrew declared that the United

By Pettusâ "That every person in whom

Morgan denounced the action of the Re
publican majority in bringing to the Sen
ate at this time in the session proposi
tions of so far reaching a character as
those relating to the Philippines and
Cuba. It was, he said, a most important
and dangerous movement, and as he and
a large body of men on hia side of the
chamber believed, in direct conflict -with
the constitution. The action of the ma
jority, ho declared. "i9 a despotism In leg
islation never paralleled in the history of
this country."
Without completing his speech, Mr. Mor
gan yielded at 5:S0, in order that the Sen

"When the Senate resumed its session at
8 o'clock the galleries were crowded and
there was a fairly good attendance of Sen

apportionment has taken another
reversal of form and Mendoclno
has once more been tossed from
one district into another. This time the
proposed Second District gets It, and
there it probably will stay for the next
ten years. The change was not made
without a two hours' wrangle over the
question In caucus this afternoon. Frank
L. Coombs came into town last night,
declaring he had dropped in only. to look
at things, but with his pockets stuffed
full of telegrams from persons wanting
to have Mendocino taken from the First
District and put with the Second. Sup
plementing these, telegrams kept arriv
ing all day from the Superior Judge and
the county officers and many more of
the prominent people i of the redwoods,
all demanding that the county be em
braced in the Second District. When the
caucus was called these telegrams had

ber and when the question came up the
county of Mendoclno was shifted.
Selvagre made a hard fight to hold the
county in the First, and he was backed
by Laird and Lardner. Davis also took
a hand and said it would be a good
thing* to have Mendoclno In the First
District.
Caldwell agreed to have Inyo Joined
to San Bernardino to form a Senatorial
r'I?trlct. so an impending fight there was
averted.
When the bill came before the Senate
It was amended in accordance with the
caucus agreement and then It was laid
over until to-morrow night, when the
San Francisco delegation will be able to
Kive the line between the Fourth and
Fifth districts. The bill will be through

there will be no material objection to it.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â Brown of San Mateo
introduced in the Assembly this morning
a bill which voices the public opinion that
in future Senatorial elections more atten
tion should be paid to the will of the peo
ple and less to the wishes of the bosses.
The bill seeks to bring about this condi
tion in sr>ite of the impossibility of elec
tion by direct vote.
Brown's measure directs the Governor
to issue a proclamation thirty days before
the general election of 1992, directing the
?-tutors to express their preference for
United States Senator. The bill provides
in detail for a place upon the ballot for
the expression of such preference and for
the tabulation of the returns and the
preparation by the Secretary of State of
an abstract of the returns.
The author contemplates the nomina
tion. In case the bill becomes a law, of
candidates for United States Senator by
the State conventions. Such nomination
and subsequent expression of publln opin
ion at the polls would act, it Is believed,
as a moral -obligation upon the Legisla
ture and would prevent deadlocks In
which the will of the people is Jg-aored.
MENTO, Feb. 25.â A special rule, intro
duced by Dunlap of the Committee on
Rules, was adopted by the Assembly to
day. By It the Committee on Rules Is
directed to prepare a special urgency file
consisting of bills to be selected in the
following manner: Each member shall
present to the committee any particular
bill which he desires taken up out c* i
order. When this list is made up the com- I
mitt*** nhall cause the nam-T of all m<-m
bers to be placed in a hat and drawn from
it by chance in the presence of the As
sembly, and a special file cf bills will be
made up in the order in which the names
are drawn. The objection of seven mem
bers at any time will stop the considera
tion of a bill on the special file. Debate
upon a bill on th.is special file shall be
limited to five minutes, to be divided be
tween those favoring and those opposing
the measure.
A similar file was provided for In the
Senate on motion of Leavitt, but It will be
made up by roll call Instead of by com
mittee. The roll will be called to-morrow
morning.' and each Senator will then
name one bill; which he may have put on
the file. It will be considered each morn

until the recess, at 12:30.

these efforts proved fruitless. Coroner
McMullen said to-night that he had ad
vised the use of grappling irons to drag
the river, and the friends of the unfor
tunate man were talking of offering a
reward as an inducement for fishermen
to recover the body.
The Coroner said that Mr. Bunner's
body no doubt was In the mud at the
bottom of the river, although the cur
rent may have carried it a considerable
distance down stream, and that it would
not be surprising that the body should
become buried in the debris which fills

MENTO, Feb. 25.â "Colonel" Martin Bra
dy, the man of many Junkets, the tender
loin statesman, who has received more
money In mileage- during this session than
any other of the class of greedy legis
lators whose chief service has been to de
vise plans whereby the State treasury
couia be further looted by means of Jun
keting trips, succeeded this morning In
getting through by irregular method res
olutions which give him 513 more than he
could claim even under the statute. The
6ame form of petty larceny Is planned by
others, and legislators whose consciences
have become seared by the rank frauds
that have been perpetrated in the way of
Junktts? can seo no cause for indignation
In Brady's grab.
'The Ellis street statesman went last
Friday to TJklah with a vÂ«*rt of the Com
mittee on , Commissions, and Public Ex
penditure. ' Bliss, Ilasson and Stewart of
Amador accompanied him. The trip itself
was only one more of the indefensible
junkets the expense of which this com
mittee has saddled upon the State, until
now it is looked upon as needing Investi
gation Itself fully as badly as the Paris
Commission, whose inquisitor It was.
Brady returned to San Krancisco and
met there his Committee on Commerce
and Navigation. I-ast evening he returned
to Sacramento, and this morning Jils
name was included In both resolutions
for mileage, ile receives $41 mileage for
the Ukiah trip and $13 for the San Fran
cisco trip. As the $41 covers the distance
actually traveled by Brady ithe J13 claim
was plainly an Illegal one.
Because of the claim's illegality, pre
sumably. Bliss, McWade and others of
Brady's friends Insisted that the resolu
tions should be acted*upon at once, though
the regular procedure is to refer the
claim to the Committee on Mileage, and
the resolutions were accordingly adopted.
The Committee on Mileage would approve
any claim, and reference to it was to be
feared only because some one else might
enter a protest. Bliss has become too
good a programmer to let his colleague,
Brady, be placed in danger, of losing
good, hard coin, and so the resolutions
went through. Assuming that Brady paid
his railroad fare, he is about %*0 "to the
good" for two days of doing nothing, in
addition to his salary as Assemblyman.
If ho did not find It necessary to pay fare
he cleaned up $59 in the two days.

While the tacutty felt compelled by a prompt

At a mass meeting of students this af

draw up several sets of resolutions. One
will asK that the lighters and their sec

the action of the faculty. It was decided

The two went to the priest. Here all
was not smooth sailing. The priest re

whether It was lawful for a father to
marry his adopted dauRhter. The Ty

to appeal to the court to set aside the
adoption. The petition was filed to-day.
It contains the following:
"The paternal and filial affection exist

the death of Annie Tynan, ripened Into
mutual conjugal affection, and It has be

that they be restored to the status they
occupied prior to the adoption."

ening the inmates of the house. She then
visited the residence. of Mr. Koester. All
had retired but Mrs. Koester, who was
sitting at a table writing a letter. Upon
hearing a knock at the door Mrs. Koester
asked who was there. The reply came:
"PJease let me In. I want to tell you
something."
Mrs. Koester than unlocked the door.
The insane visitor, clad only in her night
dress, seized her with both hands. Mrs.
Koester screamed and ran to the room
where her husband was asleep. He sprang
from bed, caught the crazy intruder and
called his brother,, who was asleep up
stairs. Together they led the poor wo
man back to her home.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 25.â The semi
official Financial Messenger, In the course
of an article denying that sugar exports
enjoy an open or a secret premium from
the Russian treasury, points out that the
charter of the sugar regime of Russia,
which fixes the selling price for the home
market at a regularly reduced rate from
year to year, is intended to protect the
Russian consumer against the encourage
ment of exportation at his expense, arid
that If secret export premiums exist at all
they are due to the growing power of
trusts and syndicates in getting various
branches of production In their power,
with no other aim than to maintain nigh
prices abroad at the expense of the home
m The e Journal de St. Petersburg says:
"Will not a dangerous precedent be cre
ated by the desire to prove at any price
that alleged secret premiums are con
cealed by the Russian. sugar regime? If
Russia employed the same logic she
would with even great justification, be
driven to Impose counter duties upon
cast iron, .steel, copper and other Ameri
can products to which the principles now
being established could be applied with
equal justification. .
"Russia would also be perfectly Justified
In applying this new procedure not only
against the United States, but also
against Western Europe, inasmuch as
this singular Idea of; the concealment of.
premiums originated in no way with the
United States. It was first proclaimed by
Europe at the Brussels conference In 1898;
and It is only such an idea, for which Eu
rope is responsible, that Russia has to
thank for an Iniquitous act on the part of
the friendly United States.
"It must, above all, not be forgotten
that this ts a slippery path, and that. If
It be pursued further, we, too. shall In
evitably proceed, without even awaiting
the expiration of commercial treaties, to
similar measures, not only with regard to
America, but also with regard to Europe
in the case of -such products as are con
trolled by/ syndicates or other orjyanlza
tlons and sold cheaper abroad than at
home.". Â¦ Â¦ -
These articles, which appear In the offi
cial organs of the Ministry . of Finance,
undoubtedly represent the views- of thÂ»
Russian Government in the application of
the theory of concealed export premiums
to trust-made products. -'Both papers slg-
Compensatory Duty May Rest

can Products.

QEORGE BIRDSALL, the heavy
weight, lost five pounds of his
superfluous flesh in a handball
game at the Olympic Club last
night. Birdcall ran up and down
the court with the speed of an an
telope and smashed the ball with all
his force, but despite his exertions he fe'l
a victim to defeat. His opponent, Louis
Levy, a youth who parts his hair In the
middle and wears a bandage around his
calf, did the trick. Levy was as nervous
as a boy declaiming his firs', piece at
school, but in his calm moments managed
to score enough points to offset the handi
cap that Blrdsall enjoyed. The game was
the moat spirited of the night. Both play
ers fought for every point and when . the
contest was concluded they were willing
to bo carried out on a shutter.
Blrdsall did not play his usual game un
til near the end of the contest. His su
perior strength then began to assert itself
and he gradually lessened the lead that

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART
TANTOBAN PAHK- Monday. Feb. 25,
The fourth race for a $300 purse was
captured by Montanic, Tommy Burns do
ing the steering. The other entries were
Ada N. Barrack and Rolling Boer. Mon
tanic airshipped at the start, the other
three trailing. Up the t>ack stretch Mon
tanic Dew, with Rolling Boer a bad sec
ond. When the stretch was reached,
Montanic was still far up In the van and
Rolling Boer and Barrack began fighting
it out for the place, the latter passing
under the wire for second money. The
race was all Montanic's. Rolling Boer
was second choice at the opening, but
closed the favorite In the betting.
The last race over seven furlongs was
won by High Hoe, Tommy Burns up.
Burns took the lead at the start and held
It throughout the race. Vohlcer got the
place and Sybaris the show. Alas in this
race tried to play the acrobat and stole a
piece of the gate, which she carried for
the full course dangling from the saddle.
lsaline with O'Connor in the saddle won
the first race sleeping. When the gate
was sprung Winnie cacried Isaline well to
the front and the rest tacked on, Toah,
the favorite, decorating the wake. At no
time was Isaline In danger. Toah began
to work up place by place and at th'i wire
passed In anead of Nellie -.Forest for the
place.
Legal Maxim, O'Connor acting as pilot
over the three furlongs in. the maiden
two-year-oldÂ«, won Â¦ the second race.
Charlie Thorpe, mounted on Snooze, took
the lead until the paddock was reached,
but was then passed by Maxim. Yrsula
came up well at the -finish and all three
money getters were driving 'hard under
the wire without any daylight showing.
Then . came the third and last winning
for Winnie O'Connor. Again he was
mounted on the premier choice, this time
Brownie Anderson being the ' money get
ter. Walkenshaw opened at 2 to 1, the
same price being slated on Anderson, but
the latter was heavily played and was
backed down to 8 to 5. The start was
not a good one, Prestome,
and Royal Prize getting away far in
front. When the race was well under
way Brownie Anderson sifted out of the
bunch and O'Connor took matters easy.
Hoyal Prize, who sold at 5 to 1 for show,
came up strongly from the paddock on
and almost beat out Walkenshaw for the
place. The route was a long one, one
mile and seventy yards.
Winnie O'Connor again distinguished
himself. He rode four races, rolling home
three winners, all of them among tne first
choices.' The day belonged to the favo
rites, although* the Invictus upset gave it
a streak of long-shot color.
A DOUBLE sensation occurred in
one race at Tanforan yesterday.
First there was a dead heat and
then a disqualification of the
favorite. Beau Ormonde, leaving
Invictus, 30 to 1, the winner. When In
victus and Beau. Ormonde passed under
the wire on a dead line i:i the fifth race a
shout went up from the stand, for it was
a sensational finish and not a hair's
breadth separated the winners of the joint
first and second places. But something
happened just before the finish that threw
Beau Ormonde but of the race when the
judges gave their post mortem. Invictus
led all the way, but from the stretch
Beau Ormonde came on like. a whirlwind
right between Darlene and Cougar. Nash
Turner, who had the leg on the favorite,
could not keep Beau Ormonde from
bumping both Cougar and Darlene when
the last driving spurt was made. The
boys were called Into the stand and
agreed as to the foul, so the Beau was
put out of It, Cougar thus getting the
place and Darlene the show. The price,
25 tÂ».l, on Invictus, was a false one.

On March 1 the Thornton stake at four
miles, to be decided at Oakland next
month, will be reopened for a period of
fifteen days, to permit of additional en
tries beinjj made. â¢

Backed from S to 3 Gusto ran away from
Small Jack In the final sprint, winning
cleverly by two lengths. Ilowell on.Satlu

Nothing warmer than Norford was de
veloped during the afternoon's proceed
ings. The Doble & Co. entry was backed
down from threes to -even money in the
betting in the mile nntl a Sixteenth sell
ing affair, and In a long, hard drive lost
the decision to Marca.to by a neck. The
winner, well ridden by Henry Shields,
opened an S to 5 choice, receding to 11
to 5.
Gil Summers' dropped his Imp. Star
Ruby-Tyranny two-vcar-old in the '"baby"
event for a good thing and the youngster
returned with the merchandise. Backed
from twos down to S to 5 he fought it out
with Montoya from the jump, winning by
a length. The latter had his odds played
down from 30 to 7 and only for an in
clination to run out would have won.
Pat Morrissey, another 1 to 2 chance,
made quite as bad a mess of the second
event. Â¦ Never partial to a heavy or stlcky
track Pat led his company to the turn
for hmne and then began preparations for
a rest. Henry Shields urged him along,
and thofcfih responding somewhat he
finished third. J. Alexander, by an ap
plication of perseverance and muscle,
landed tho 12 to 1 .shot Cue llrst, a head
in front <â¢Â£ Maydine.
.. no great amount of surprise.
Daniel and Tyranus were the favorites
successful In landing purses, while Pat
Morrlssey and Hermoso* let their friends
down with an expensive thud. The at
tendance was large and the ten book3
laying odds were kent bu?f .
Roiled down to a three-horse race the
fifth number was put down as a certainty
for Bookmaker Cook's Hermoso. The
big chestnut sprinter led Jerid and Bound
lee Into the stretch three lengths and then
under Dominick's weak riding died away.
Jerid' strided into the leading position and
won easing up. Boundlee, apparently not
at his best, ran a poor third.

. I.OS ANGELES, Feb. 23.â Dr. Ordway, a
retired Eastern physician, Is mourning the
loss of $3000 In consequence of his too
ready investment In the financial schemes
of others. ' About a week ago E>r. Ord
way met a young promoter who volun
teered to show him the city and suburbs
and to give him any inside information
about realty and investments that he
wanted. One particularly bright outlook
was In the building of some Income-pay
ing houses in Los Angeles, which, if a
man could put in about $3090, would al
most yield him enough to live on in peace
for the rest of his days.
This was just what the doctor was look
ing for, so the young promoter appointed
a meeting for the doctor and his friend,
who was an architect and who was doing
the final work on the plans In his work
room. Dr. Ordway kept his appointment
and the young promoter took him to the
architect s workroom. After some techni
cal discussion about floors, gables and
hallways and when a general outline of
the financial plan had been given, the
doctor expressed his desire to invest and
asked the young- promoter-, to take him up
to the tank, the architect in the mean
time making an appointment with the
doctor for the purpose of signing the
papers and paying the money, which ap
pointment was faithfully carried out by
all parties.
Twenty-four hours later the doctor
came to the conclusion that he had been
bunkoed and reported the matter to the
police. , . 'Â¦'.â¢.Â¦'-; â¢

affirming the Judgment of the United
States Circuit Court of Montana in the
case of Harriet S. Holton, executrix of
Harriet Wood, deceased, vs. Andrew J.
Davis Jr. and the First National Bank
of Butte, Montana, and others. The suit
was brought to recover possession of 950
shares of stock of the bank, valued In the
neighborhood of $2,000,000.
In rendering the decision the Court of
Appeals said that the wholesale charges
of dishonesty and conduct unbecoming at
torneys in accepting fees on both fides
were hardly worthy of any reply.
Forbls & Forbis. Dixon & Klrkpatrick.
of counsel for Andrew J. Davis Jr., were
charged virtually with unprofessional con
duct and accused of accepting fees both
from John A. Davis and Andrew Davis.
"The agreement made by counsel and
an additional agreement signed "John A
Davis,* " said the court, "of themselves
acquit these counsel from any blame,
wrongdoing or Improper conduct in the
premises. The charges against Toole,
Claybcrg & McConnell, of counsel for the
estate, are really unfounded and have no
support from any evidence contained in
this voluminous record."

corner was left unsearched for something
to shoot. Small shot kept flying close to
Derby. Unger and Bushnell. Finally when
Bushnell's hat had been fhot off and his
pocket flask had been broken by a charge
of No. 9, he said he guessed he had Cole
man skinned to death and called his men
off.
The fight came when the score was
made up. Bushnell's side had seventy
mudhen heads and they were ruled out
with the statement that the whole bird
should have been brought in. Some al
leged frogs he had were declared to be
toads. One of Coleman's snakes was
thrown out on the ground that It had
been dead too long. He was also denied
scoring on Bushnell's wounds because
that gentleman was still alive.
No decision was reached and the fight
was transferred to this city. Each of the
captains is running hourly to Hosmer
with new claims and new points, but up
to date it looks as if Bushnell was a loser.

STOCKS FOR GRAPES
AS LARGE AS PLUMS
Secretary Filcher Receives Them and
Cutting^ of Phenomenal French
Raspberry Bushes.
Secretary Filcher of the State Board
of Trade yesterday received from Paris
stocks of raspberry bushes and grape
vines which will, he hopes, give to Cali
fornia the glory of producing greater
grapes and raspberries than have ever
yet grown on Its favored soil. The cut
tings 'came in good condition from
France, with perhaps tne exception of
one raspberry snoot. They were all hand
ed over to K. S." Maslln, who has a State
reputation for expert skill 1n making any
thing take root that will grow. Last
night Mr. Maslln took the cuttings to
Alameda and planted them, and the first
step toward stocking California with
these varieties was thus taken.
The grapes are known in France as the
Pare de Versailles. The berries are as
large as small plums, as Mr. Filcher de
scribes them. The grape and raspberry
cuttings were all sent by J. M. Bulssori,
who Is the secretary of the French asso
ciation for producing fruit by the forcing
process, under glass. Mr. Filcher made
his acquaintance in France and secured a
promise that he would assist in making
desired experiments in California. The
raspberries are as superior to the ordin
ary raspberries Jn size and appearance as
the forced grapes are superior to the
open air varieties. The place where these
fruits were seen by Mr. Filcher to be
thriving was on the 50,000-acre tract of
Baron Rothschild, on which is the town
of Fehrerer.
FAR northward and headed toward
the aurora borealls, their wings
pushing wind with every bit of
energy possessed by them, are
about all the ducks and geese,
snipe and other fowl capable of rapid
flight that up to a late hour Saturday
night occupied feeding space on the Sul
sun marshes. The frantic birds are only
Intent on one thingâ getting to any region,
even though it be wrapped in ice, where
man Is not. They are spurred on by the
remembrance of a nightmare resembling
a belated Fourth of July celebration that
caused them to drop their celery roots
and sardines and quit their happy home.
Out on the marshes now are but a few
crippled' mudhens that are Just beginning
to crawl into the open again and wonder
whether the powder works really blew up
or If it was only a rumor. Here in San
Francisco Fred H. Bushnell and John B.
Coleman, members of the Field and Tule
Club, which has its preserve at Cordelia,
are striving each to show that the other
Is the one who should pay for a dinner for
twenty-three members and guests of the
club, which is to take place at a French
rotlsserle next Saturday night.
. These troubles on the part of birds and
men are the result of some Saturday
night and Sunday happenings that form
the wildest and weirdest chapter In the
history of the Sutsun marshes, or on the
logbook of the Field and Tule Club.
Last week it was decided to have a big
day's sport at the preserve on Sunday
by forming two teams to hunt against
each other. The teams were made up,
with Fred Bushnell and John B. Coleman,
captains, as follows:
" Bushaells â A. F. Hopke. Thomas Hasklns,
H. 1*. Miller, J. Homer Frltch. N. Gray, An
drew Jackson, J. J. Winner, Frank V. Bell,
L. Titus and W. T. Hobson.
Colemansâ Georgre Jackson. A. M. Shields,
Edwin Cramer. John S. Lawscn, W. Bay,
George Belbe6helmer. M. E. Unger, Dr. Derby,
L. W. Harpham and Charley Hall.
Harry Hosmer, J. J. Wlrtner and J. B.
Coleman went up Saturday to prepare for
the big hunt and Bushnell and the others
went up on the night train with great ex-
pectations as to the birds they would
slaughter.
When the train bearing the sportsmen
reached the station Saturday night
Charley Hall, as prearranged, fired four
shots to notify the three men at the pre
serve. Five minutes afterward the
heavens were filled with the feathery fire
sprays of motor bombs, spluttering rock
ets, Roman candles and red fire. Fire
crackers In bunches and barrels, and
bombs big enough to tear a hole In a
Spanish cruiser were set off. It seemed
on the marshes that night as if China
New Year were working overtime.
Among the tules there was a squawking
and screeching that almost vied with the
noise at the clubhouse, and with a great
whirring and flapping the feathered crea
tures began cutting through â¢ space in
bands and bunches, hoping they couffl
reach Alaska or Siberia before {he sky
fell in.
Only the mudhens remained. They did
not count themselves worth escaping.
When Bushnell and the others arrived
he said he did not 6ee much use In hunt
ing after the spectacular reception that
had been handed out. Hosmer reminded
him that the contest Â¦was for a dinner and
that Bushnell would have to buy It If he
refused to play.
"The captain of the losing team has to
settle for the dinner," said Hosmer, and
Bushnell and Coleman opened their eyes.
"I have prepared a list of. points; here
it is," and he read the following:
Teal, widgeon, sprig, canvasbacks, mallards
EngHÂ»h snipe, spoonbills, geese and coots 1;
bitterns, 2; larks, owls and M. E. Unger 5
hawks, shags, diver and terrapin, 10; Bh'ell
drakes and Derby, 15; snakes, rats, mudhens
and Harry Miller, 25: coons (any old color) and
frogs, 50; swans, pelicans and minx, 10O: Fred
Bushnell, 160.
"There Is the list, gentlemen, and I
will not read again. For everything not
on the list brought in 300 points will be
taken off.
Hosmer had spoken and none made pro-
That hunt when Sunday broke into the
time schedule was one of the hardest
6^ u ? u Â£ ver Performed by members of the
club. There were | only mudhens and
E^Pl.f"? 1168 and tro * s left Â« and they were
all filled with fright. The mudhens flew
as high as geese and the frogs could leap
across a lagoon. There was scarcely a
let-up in the fusillade of firearms and no

The dependence of local merchants upon
Asiatic Importations of rice will soon
cease If the anticipations of the capital
ists of this city, who have Invested hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in building
and stocking the huge Hinz Rico Milling
Company at Beaumont, Jefferson County.
Texas, are realized. Not only will Califor
nia, which, in conseqeunce of the large
foreign contingent among i its population.
Is the greatest consumer In the United
States, be entirely independent of every
rice producing country in the world, but
will also be enabled to produce rice
cheaper even than the cheapest coolie la
bor can raise it anywhere. It is confi
dently stated that with the California ma
chinery. Invented and manufactured in
San Francisco, better rice at less cost con
be raised In the wide and fertile fields of
Louisiana and Texas than anywhere else
upon the face of the earth.
For six months Mr. Hinz, the well
known miller, has been engaged In the
erection of an immense rice mill at Beau
mont, the machinery of which was built
In this city. The capacity of the mill Is
1200 barrels of clean rice per day. The
machinery Includes engines and shafting,
hullers, separators, scourers, pollshtrs
and packers, doing the work of a thou
sand coolies and producing from, the
husk a much larger percentage of "whole"
rice than can possibly be realized by the
hand work of the most skillful laborer.
Mr. llinz returned from Beaumont lat-t
night and reported the mill In complete
operation and the pronoects for the com
ing 1 year all that could be desired." The
following linns are represented In the di
rectorate of the company: M. J. Bran

and 3,000,000 acres are embraced In their
area. The fields are almost level and are
flooded by intersecting streams by an
elaborate system of ;irlgatlon. The aver

per acre and the yield. If the whole acre
age was planted, would be about 2.500,000.
0i)0 pounds, or four times the entire con
sumption of the United States.
Harvesting of rice is very similar to
that of wheat. The husk is threshed from
the stalk and carried tiÂ» the mill and there
prepared for market. Beaumont, wher?
the latest field of the far-reachinj? enter
prise of San Francisco merchants Is lo
cated, is near the scene of that Kroat oil
gusher which broke from the ground
about six weeks ago and has astonished
the world by Its power and magnitude.

Woman's greatest gift is the power to inspire admiration,
respect, and love. There is a beauty in health which is more
attractive to men than mere regularity of features.
The snap and spirit which health gives to the eye, the
movement, and the speech are full of magnetism.
Sickly women can't understand this.
They only know that they are miserable, and their efforts
to be attractive are languid and weak.
Woman's influence in the world is limited by her strength,
and the strength of health is real strength.
It brings with it beauty and grace and loveliness of dis-
position.
To bo a successful wife, to retain the love and admiration
of her husband, should be a woman's constant study. If she
would be all she may, she must guard well against the signs
of ill health.
Regular and painless menstruation is absolutely necessary.
Tho help which Lydia E. Pinkhum's Vegetable
Compound gives to women who are attacked by any dis-
order of the feminine organism is real, permanent help. It
cures all weaknesses of the organs and makes it possible for
women. to retain their health and beauty to mature years.

MECHANICS' INSTITUTE ELECTION.
BEFORE the members of the Mechanics' Insti
tute there is now an opportunity to establish
a library "of the first rank and to lay. its founda
tions so deeply, broadly and firmly that for all time
to come it will stand as a monument to their sagacity
and public spirit. The election to be held to-day
affords them a means of taking advantage of that
opportunity. If progressive men be placed on the
board of trustees all will be well.- If men of hesitating
character or of narrow views be chosen the opportu
nity now so promising may be lost never to return.
The Call has no particular candidate or ticket of
candidates to support or to oppose. The members
of the association are all persons of intelligence and
are doubtless acquainted with the characters of the
various* candidates. They can determine for them
selves which candidates are most likely to build up
the library and which, if elected, would be inclined
to a policy of stagnation. All The Call has to say
concerning the issue is that every member of the
association should vote, and in making up his
ticket should bear in mind that San Francisco needs
a great library; that when such a library has been
established it will be liberally supported, and finally,
that the Mechanics' Institute is now in a position to
furnish that library.
The institute is in possession of large resources of
which adequate use has not yet been made. There
is need of a better, larger and more commanding
building, and with the wealth possessed by the insti
tution it would not be difficult for competent and
energetic trustees to provide a means for the speedy
construction of the desired edifice. Once erected, the
building in itself would be an attraction to the multi
tude. The increased convenience would result in- an
immediate increase of membership, and that in turn
would bring about a keener public interest in the
institution and its work, so that in a time compara
tively short the library would have entered upon a
new era in its history and become one of the notable
institutions of America.
In the history of every organization there comes a
time when the personal influence of the men in control
of its affairs becomes a matter of vast importance.
These periods occur whenever an old order of things
has reached its full development and there remains
the choice of stagnation or a new departure. The
men who founded the library and erected its present
building did a great and important work for the city
at that time. With the passage of the years, however,
there have been growth and progress in all directions.
The city is larger, its body of students and scholars
has increased, and the demands for library facilities
have augmented. The members of the association at
this time who desire to uphold and to follow the
example of the founders must,, like them, be pro
gressive. They must study the situation before them,
note with care the opportunity that is afforded for
performing a great work and then go ahead with
confidence and courage.
San Francisco expects much of the Mechanics' In
stitute. The whole community is concerned in the
election to-day. The opportunity for obtaining a
great library is most excellent. The public therefore
relies upon the members of the association to go to
the polls resolved to elect progressive men.
riage. Games and field sports of all kinds
are encouragedâ boxing, football, racing,
rowing, etc. Tattooing is universal among
boys; not to be tattooed is a mark of
cowardice or weakness. Music, dancing,
artistic handicrafts ar.d the love of flow
ers are all greatly in vogue. In a native
house the two most conspicuous objects
are the cradle and a flower stand. These
give, indications of the national character.
The schools are numerous and excellent,
and as a result the Burmese are a well
educated people. It is extremely rare to
find a man who ennnot read and write. In
1S9S-9 a sum of Â£96.CÂ£2 ($484,760) was spent
by the Government for educational pur
poses.
The Government is composed of a lieu
tenant governor, a legislative council "for
making laws and regulations," consisting
of nine members, four being 1 natives, and
a secretariat of five members. In Lower
Burma there is a chief court of Justice
with four judges, and in Upper Burma a
judicial commissioner.
Tranquil Under Good Government.
In ancient times the Burmese used to
say they had five enemiesâ fire, water,
robbers, rulers anrl ill-wishers. British-
Indian rule, however, secures life and
property and the fulfilling of contracts.
It has given new value to native enter
prise and thrift. The spirit of Independ
ence is greatly on the Increase; and this
is fostered by the fact that the Govern
ment is careful to preserve the native
official machinery.
With reaped to the Shan states, the
lieutenant governor in his last report says
they "are tranquil and prosperous." Da
coity Is on the decline everywhere; In
deed, In Upper Burma It is absolutely un
known. The most troublesome class Is
the- "ti," or gamblers: these still Infest the
country districts, and by tricks with cards
and dice defraud the simple-minded farm
ers of their savings.
The principal commercial Industries are
connected with rice and timber. Indigen
ous manufacturers produce little more
than what is used on the spot. The
characteristic of Burmese work Is vigor
.and novelty of design, rather than high
finish. While there is abundance of water
ways there is urgent need for better and
more extended land communication. To
meet this railways are In course of con
struction in all directions.
The amounts received and expended In
the province of Burma during the year
ended December 31. 18;>9. were as follows:
Receipts, Â£4,659.360; expenditures, Â£2,975,
281. Hence Burma is reckoned a rich pro
vince, and its excess cf revenue Is a use
ful and welcome item In the Indian im
perial exchequer.
110 degrees Fahrenheit at Swebo and at
the_Ruby mines 54 degrees Fahrenheit,
in December the shade temperature varies
from 86 degrees to 38 degrees Fahrenheit.
The Resources of Burma.
Lower Burma possesses extraordinary
fertility. It is subject, however, to floods
caused by the overflowing of the mighty
Irrawadl and its tributaries. Rice is the
principal cropâ six-sevenths of the laii-l
Is devoted to its culture. Tobacco, cotton
and the sugarcane also thrive. The
Burmese are content with one crop a year,
and so the manure Is simply the previous
year's stubble, which is burned and mixed
with the soil. Upper Burma, which is
somewhat arid, suitors severely from
drought. It is a fine upland rolling coun
try, with immense tracts of forest, yield-
Ing vast supplies of teak and other valu
able timber. The chief crops are rlo.
maize, "rve, wheat, suearcane, cotton, to
bacco, tea and indigo.
The province of Burma Is remarkably
rich in mineral wealth. Gold, silver, cop
per, lead, tin, coal. Iron, jade and precious
stonesâ especially rubles and sapphires
are all found In more or less abundance.
The ruby mines, which are a fruitful
source of revenue to the Government, aro
situated at Mugok. seventy miles north of
Mandalay, the capital of Upper Burma.
These perns are separated from the gravel
and sand in- the same way as gold. The
value of the annual export amounts to
seven lakhs of rupees. There are also
large deposits of magnetic oxide which
have as yet been untouched. Wells for
the- production of petroleum have long ex
isted. Of livestock, cattle are the most
numerous, and a considerable trade Is car
ried on In hides.
History of the Province.
The early history of Burma is. of course,
lost in antiquity. The original Burmese
tribes are conjectured to have pushed
their way south from the mountains of
Tibet, and to have subdued and incor
porated the aborigines. In the year 1000
B. C. Burma was a powerful empire, quite
able to resist the Incursions of the Chi
nese and of the other neighboring nations.
Mapnlfleent ruins and relics remains to
attest the splendor of that earhy period
Since the Christian era Portugal, Holland
and France have in turn held parts of
the Burmese peninsula. The first British
settlement was in > 1G16, when factories
were erected at the mouth of the Irra
wadi. The first British mission from In
dia was in 1795, when valuable concessions
were obtained from the native rulers.
Complete British possession of the prov
ince of Burma, however, has been ob
tained at the cost of three v.arsâ 1S24, 1S52
BY a vote ominously large the Supervisors have
passed to print the resolution providing for the
reopening of gambling at Ingleside racetrack.
To that extent the menace of revival of the old evil
which in the. past blighted so many homes in' the city
has been brought nearer to the people. The situation
is grave, but there is r.o reason why any good citizen
should abandon the fight for morality. From "passage
to pnr.t" to- the final passage of an ordinance is a far
cry, and it can hardly be doubted that when the final
test comes several at least of the Supervisors who
voted for passing to print will then vote on the side of
the people. -.â¢ ... Â¦:' â¢ â¢ Â¦ . -
There is not a single valid excuse for the passage cf
such, an ordinance. Jt is not needed for the purpose
of permitting legitimate racing in San Francisco, for
there is now no law of the city and county forbidding
that kind of racing. The only thing to be attained by
the ordinance is the permission of gambling. It is
therefore a plain proposition of whether or not men
elected to office to guard the welfare of the. city will
be faithful to their duties or give to gamblers a legal
right to attract to the" city all kinds of blacklegs to
prey upon the community.
It has been argued in-some quarters that, since pool
telling and bookmaking are permitted elsewhere, we
Ehould permit similar practices here. A sufficient an
ewer to that was made by one of the pastors of the
city in the statement: "Because one man chokes his
wife is no reason why I should choke mine." If other
cities and counties are willing to expose their youth
to the temptations of gamblers and their vicious fol
lowing of toughs and touts, .there is all the more
reason why San Francisco should set a better example.
We cannot afford to follow the vices of other commu
nities. We have enough, of our own as it is.
.While no valid argument can be advanced in support
of the ordinance, there are many weighty ones against
It. In the first place, the question: has been submitted
to the people in the manner prescribed in the charter,
End by them the proposal to legalize gambling was
voted down. The Board of Supervisors is bound by
every obligation that rests! upon public officials to
respect the decision thus given and to uphold it. To
do otherwise would be not' only to declare the people
have no right to regulate their own affairs, but would
be to nullify one of. the most important provisions of
the charter which every member of the board has
solemnly pledged himself to support.'
The question was submitted to the people, and the
vote of the people was against the gamblers. If the

PASSED TO PRINT.
MORGAN ON TREATIES
SENATOR MORGAN, has resumed his usual
nagging and indirect tactics toward the admin
istration in regard to the Nicaraguan canal and
the treaties necessary as precedent to its construction
by this Government. ' . .
Bearing in mind that the canal must be constructed
by the United States, within the jurisdiction of two
other sovereignties,, and that at our instance the
Cjayton-Bulwer treaty was negotiated with Great
Britain, thus bringing a third sovereignty into the
circle, it will be seen that only by. treaty and inter
rational agreement between the four sovereignties
concerned can any progress be made.
In order to clear the way for work the President
and Secretary Hay substituted the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty for the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and then ar
ranged in line therewith protocols for canal treaties
with Nicaragua and,,Costa Rica. ,
. These wise and. well-tim'edr arrangements of the
President removedall international obstacles and put
the four sovereignties concerned in line. ; The canal
has never been as near to accomplishment as when
Congress met last December. If the Hay- Pauncefote
treaty had been ratified the treaties with the two Cen
tral American states would have followed according
to the protocols. and everything would be ready now
for work. But the Senate, moved partly by jingoism
and partly by the enemies of the canal, proceeded to
butcher the Hay-Pauncefote treaty and warp it out
of all resemblance to the purpose it was intended to
save. This made its return to Great Britain neces
sary and made any action on the canal at this session
impossible.
Now comes Morgan, proposing that Congress shall
do something to force the treaties contemplated by
the protocols with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and
this in the face of the fact known to him that the thiee
treaties were interdependent and composed a com
plete and symmetrical treaty system, harmonizing
every international interest concerned.
In urging this policy of folly Senator Morgan said:
"We are bound to agree with Costa Rica and Nicara
gua as to the terms on which canal privileges will
be extended to the United States, if this subject is
to be settled by agreement. It is clear that the Pres
ident, in making these agreements in the name of the
United States, defiantly disregarded any claim of riglu
that Great Britain could assert to the effect that her
consent was necessary to such action on his part as
President."
Nothing could be more dishonest or dishonorable
than that statement. Nor could anything be more
misleading. Morgan knows, as does the country,
that, in the interest of economy of time and in loyalty
to the canal, the President negotiated the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty to open the way for the protocols
with Costa Rica and Nicaragua. His action was
equally characterized by good sense and international
propriety. Morgan knows that to proceed on the
protocols with the Hay-Pauncefote treaty beaten is
to, in effect, denounce and abrogate the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty and impeach our national* good faith
before the world.
Morgan knows that his criticism is not only a false
hood as to the fact butus demagogic in purpose and
fatal to the canal in effect.
That. project is, unfortunately, caught and crushed
between the demagogy and dishonesty which are the
odium of American politics.

cost the Indian Government Â£3.000.000 was
the dethronement of the despotic Kinp
Theebaw and the final annexation of tr.o
whole province to the empire of India.
The question of annexation was hotly dis
cussed in Groat Eritaln, and It was said
that it would never pay. An estimate
was made, after the second war, which
showed that Â»n the first five years there
would be a heavy burden upon Great Brit
ain and India. As a fact, however, a few
years after the pacification and opening
out of the country the annual surplus

Burma is the easternmost province of
the empire of India. It is bounded by
China. Slam and the sea: to the west ate
Assam and Bengal. It is remarkable, geo
graphically, for noble mountain ranges
and splendid navigable rivers. It pos

Upper Burma and the Shan states. Tho
delta country of Lower Burma is flat, but
farther inland the country is hilly, and
the scenery In Upper Burma is almost
English in verdure and repose. The Shan
states are the moat mountainous. Th j
area of Lower and Upper Burma Is some

Famine in India Hot Ended.
According to reports from India up to
the last of January, there is still a very
dark outlook on the India famine ques
tion. In Upper and Central India the- ag
ricultural prospects are most decidedly fa
vorable, but in some of the other districts,
especially Bombay, the monsoons ceased
early In September, and owing to the ab
sence of rain serious distress in expected
between now and August. This will call
for a large expenditure for relief meas
ures, as well as causing a decided loss ot
revenue. Prices for grain continue high
in the affected localities, but when the
upper India harvest Is secured It is ex
pected that they will drop nearer to their
normal level. No less than 223.000 persona
are now in receipt of relief, and it is hoped
that this number will not, for the present
at least, show any marked increase. â Bos

the completion of the survey. The reduc

HE suggestion of The Call has been adopted by
Tthe administration and Congress. Our readers
will remember that we advised that an extra
session be avoided and the Cuban incident closed, by
Congress empowering the President to accept the Cu
ban constitution and withdraw the troops. Acting on
this line, the Senate Committee on Cuban Affairs pro
poses an amendment to the army appropriation bill,
reciting the resolution that declared war against Spain
and providing that when a Cuban constitution is re
ported to the President he is to accept it.
This acceptance, however, has limitations. The con
stitution must give the United States supervision of
foreign treaties made by the new republic. It must
repudiate the Spanish debt incurred by that kingdom
in its endeavor to suppress the Cuban revolution/which
was funded on the revenues of the island. Cuba must
agree to lease or sell to the United States naval or
coaling stations such as the President shall accept is
adequate for the protection of our interests in those
waters. The United States shall also have such an
interest in the sanitation of the cities of the island as
may be useful in protecting our own Gulf and Atlantic
ports from contagion with yellow fever or other epi
demic.
It is gratifying to know that a draft of the Cuban
constitution containing these exact provisions is al
ready made and has been submitted to the President
and Secretary of War. As we have stated the objec
tions to some of these conditions, it is only fair to
discuss them from the standpoint of those who affirm
them, with a view of giving the arguments on both
sides.
The first requirement is exactly copied from our
own agreement with France in the treaty of 1778. In
that agreement we made France our suzerain in in
ternational matters, and she sustained that relation to
us until we violated the treaty by making an independ
ent commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1793.
As our forefathers endured that condition for fifteen
years, until they felt strong enough to violate a prom
ise made to France in payment of her aid in gaining
independence, Cuba may not stand out in a matter
of the same kind. A successful revolution wipes out
all such obligations as the Spanish debt based on
Cuban revenue. Such a debt carries with it the obli
gation of Spain to retain control of Cuba and her
revenues. Failing in that, the matter takes the same
legal phase as arises in the relation of principal and
surety on individual debt. The principal is held good
for the debt, and must be exhausted before recourse
is had upon the surety. It is necessary, however, that
Cuba should have the protection of the United States
in regard to this debt. It is held in France, arid a
Icrge block of it is said to belong to the treasury of
the Vatican. Under such circumstances Cuba would
hardly be able, single-handed, to resist the encroach
ment necessary to its collection.
The relation established by the two foregoing pro
visions makes it absolutely necessary, for the sake
of Cuba, that we have coaling and station facilities
for our navy. This will save her the expense of a
navy and put us in a position to always make good our
guarantee of her independence.
This arrangement for submitting the constitution to
the President will avoid an extra session and at the
same time make unnecessary our continued occupa
tion of Cuba until the next Congress meets. Both of
these are desirable.
CUBAN INCIDENT CLOSED
THE HIGH COURT OF NATIONS.
AMONG the things which have been accom
plished in this young and tender century the
organization oi the "Permanent Court of Ar
bitration," provided for by the famous peace confer
ence at The Hague, rhould not be overlooked. Re
ports from Europe announce that the great court has
been fully organized, has a competent array of secre
taries, clerks and functionaries of all sorts, and is
ready to do business.
Fifteen of the great powers of the earth are repre
sented in the court. Among them are the United
States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain
and Sweden and Norway. The representatives of the
nations are men of the highest ability. Those of the
United States are Chief Justice Fuller, ex-President
Benjamin . Harrison, Attorney General Griggs and
Judge George Gray. Great Britain's representation
is headed by Lord Pauncefote; that of Germany by
the president of the Imperial High Court of the Em
pire; Austria also is represented by the Chief Justice
of its highest court, while in the Russian members of
the court are the Minister of Justice and the Procur
ator of the Holy Synod. Other nations are repre
sented by dignitaries of equal eminence and fitness for
the place, and we are told that the clerks and secre
taries are also men of learning and dignity.
A court of that kind is quite able to do big busi
ness and do it properly if any should ever happen to
come that way. Nor is there any lack of business
that might go before it. The Chinese imbroglio alone
is sufficient to afford the court an opportunity to make
a record. Unfortunately China cannot be given a
hearing, .nor can the South African republics. The
object of the court is to arbitrate between nations,
and the South African* republics, are not counted as
nations, while, China, being a land of heathens who
have no skill in modern arms, can be dealt with by
the powers without troubling the court.
Â¦ For the present, then, the "Permanent Court of
Arbitration" is hardly anything more than a name.
It is not even so much as a spectacle, for its members
are at home attending to business, and it may be a
long time before it ever puts itself on exhibition with
a full bench. Despite its seeming futility, however,
the court may yet prove of value to the world and to
the cause of peace. It is, at any rate, a reminder of
a certain aspiration for the honest adjustment of in
ternational disputes and controversies, and may de
velop into something worthy of the august title it
has assumed.

David Belasco's great war drama. "The

house at the Cenkral Theater last even

last evening illustrated that military pro

ever. The cast, which Is a large one,
was well selected. The scenery and effects
were perfect in every detail- and the play
went with a vim and snap that showed
that special care had been taken in the
rehearsals. Miss Lorena Atwo'od, the new
leading lady at> the Central Theater, was
well received. She assumed the character
of Kate Kennion. Miss At wood has a
splendid stage appearance and a well
modulated voice. In the barrack-room
scene In the second act she was especially
strong. Clifford Dempsey, in the leading
role of Lieutenant Hawkesworth, is
good. He portrayed the much-abused and
Innocent cavalry officer with a polish and
manly grace that made a most favorable
Impression. The rest^of the cast is good.

heaven and earth than have been dreamed
of In the Belasco psychology.
After all Is said, the play leaves a bad
taste in your mouth and makes you look
at life with a Jaundiced eye. I suppose
this Is due to the impression of the. de
testable first actâ which almost needs
purification by policeâ and to the generally
low tone at which most of the character 5
are pitched.
In the low comedy scenes of the play
Mrs. Carter acts with a realism worthy
cf Zola at his worst. Oddly enough, this
does not prevent her being really pathetic
where pathos is required; where the high
est tragic power is called for her art does
not ring quite true, being overstrained
and forced. Yet her Intelligence, her
mobility and her elocution are ao far
above the average that one must be
thankful for this opportunity of seeing
her. even at $2 a seat.

did not have all the appreciating to them
selves, for the gallery gave the singer the
glad hand, and when she concluded with
the risque ballad concerning the bold sol
dier and the pretty 'maid who sobHingly,
but alas, vainly, asked him to marry her.
It was as good as an earthquake to hear
tho gallery come down. Of the new peo
ple the Brothers Bard shine foremost In
the way of acrobatic excellence and orig
inality. John Le Hay follows with a very
comical turn at ventriloquism. Tho che
valier, A. L. Guille, ihe little French tenor
who sings "The Palms'" and "La Donna
e Mobile" so well, was welcomed bade
with encores. The sketch is that rare
short story told by Richard Harding
Davis entitled "The Littlest Girl." and
Robert Hllliard and Harry St. Marno do
an effecting bit of acting. . The holdovers,
the Kelcey Sisters, the Dumonds, Al and
Mamie Anderson and the American Blu
graph, round out a first-class entertain
ment. < .
Tivoli.
The prediction made last week that
"The Wizard of the Nile" was good for
more than one week at the Tlvoll has
been fully verified. Last night the sec-
ond -week of that Jolly comic opera began
before a large audience that laughed
through It all. The cast is one of the
beat ever seen or heard In the opera.
Ferris Hartmnn, Alf Wheelan, Maud Wil
liams, Annie' Myers. Bernice Holmes and
Arthur Boyce repeated their successes In
great shape. The whole performance went
off with a vim. The voices of the princi
pals and of the chorus were in good trim.
The local hits and fags had lost nothing
of their charm for the auditors. The stag
ing was all that could be asked for. "The
Wizard" would easily run another weejc,
but the management will put on "Tho
Wedding Day" after the present week.
There will be a performance of "The Wiz
ard" every evening this week and tho cus
tomary Saturday matinee.
Alcazar.
"What happened to "Jones" might have
happened to any one else, but the way
in which the company at the Alcazar
portrays the adventures of that uncertain
individual is a cause of much merriment
for those who have the pleasure of wit
nessing the performance. From the rise
to the fall of the curtain the risible waves
fluctuate through the auditorium until it
becomes necessary to let down the curtain
to preserve the equanimity of the audi
ence. "What Happened to Jones" is a
comedy pure and simple. No plot has it
of course, but Just u combination of hu
morous episodes that make men and wo
men forget they ever had any trouble. It
is an interesting tit-bit of human interest
Alhambra.
Black and white face talent divide the
honors of Al G. Field's minstrels at the
Alhamhra. The blackface comedians fur
nish the fun and the whiteface perform
ers, tha vocal end of the programme, and
together they make up one of the finest
minstrel shows seen here for some time.
The programme is , excellently >' varied
There are sentimental songs, coon songs
of course, and Jokes, some of which are'
absolutely new. The sketch "One Day at
the White House" is replete with mirth
and fun and alone is more than worth the
modest Alhambra price of admission.
Fischer's.
A distinct novelty, was offered at Fisch
er's Concert House last night when
FleC-htl's Tyrolean troupe appeared for
the first time In thia city. The members
of the organization are true types of the
Tyrol and their songs and dances are In
imitable. Antonio and Conchita Martinez
gave some pretty - Mexican dances and
Richard and Margaret Leoni presented" a
wonderful aerial performance. Gertrude
Amsell and Ruth Kelta sang some new
songs and the musical act of Rosco and
Sims was warmly applauded.'
California.
"The Village Parson" was thoroughly
enjoyed by a large audience at the Cali
fornia last night. It went much moro
Bmoothly than on the opening night and
all the principal characters were warmly
applauded. "The Holy City," sung by
Miss Anna Viola Risher behind the scenes,
was a fine effort and was well received. -

The ordinance granting the Bay and
Coast Railroad a franchise to enter the
city at Twenty-fourth and Illinois street-*
was passed to print by the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday. Curtis explained that
the bill was amended In committee to
meet the objections of tha Federated-Mis
sion Improvement Club. A condition had
been Imposed requiring the company to
depress its tracks should it ever become a
public necessity by building a tunnel un
der Ocean View. McCarthy moved as an
amendment that the company be required
to substitute electricity for steam within
the city limits on s!x months' notice, but
the amendment was lost. Attorney Bag
gett, for the company, stated that such a
plan would not be practicable. The Mayor
desired to Jknow If the company would
perform ?25,000 worth of construction
work before the final passage of the ordi
nance at the end of ninety days. Baggett
said that the ordinance had been before
tho board for a year and the "ninety-day
provision" obtained from the time the bill
was first Introduced. HotaHng directed
attention to the charter provision, which
required a railroad to have fifty miles of
road already built bÂ«fore being permitted
to connect at the water front. Reed read
the pledge of the Democratic Supervisors
not to permit any railway company to
operate tracks through any densely popu
lated district.
"We also pledged ouselves to remove
the Southern Pacific tracks," said Reed,
"and we have condemned them as a pub
lic nuisance by ordinance and here we are
about to give a little road, whose backers
are unknown, a similar privilege." -
Curtis said the committee had voted to
gTant the franchise only on the agreement
of the company to expend |25,0<J0 before
next June. The Southern Pacific runs
through the populous Mission district,
while the line of the Bay Coast road
would be along: a marshy land. The vote
on the ordinance was. Ayesâ Booth, Box

Connor, Curtis, D'Ancona, Dwyer. Fon

Thirty-six ciays in each year. Action was

to voice their -earnest opposition to a

First Act of the Belasco Play Is Hopelessly Bad, but
the Others Are Decidedly Better.
THE first act of "Zaza" 1b hope
lessly bad. It passes my compre
hension to understand how de
cent -women and Intelligent men
can find anything Interesting In
this vulgar picture of life behind the
scenes In a third-rate vaudeville theater.
True, thia la a "Bllce of life" and a
"bleeding" one â¢ with a vengeance, but
civilized men do not live on. raw meat
and rotten potatoes, and this Is the food
on which we are fed In this first act.
The second act Is a vast improvement
on the first. We see the poor, degraded
Zaza. the gutter-girl who has not fallen
from any high state, but who was simply
born to vice as most women are to vir
tueâwe see her softened and even a lit
tle purified by a man whom she thlnk3
honest and good. Her rage when she be
gins to suspect that he Is deceiving her
Is natural and proper; her determination
to get at thÂ£ truth by the most direct
means is admirable and courageous. The
third act â where Zaza questions her lov
er's child and learns from the little girl's
lips that he is married, has been much
condemned by Borne moralists; I must
confess myself quite unable to see any
thing objectionable in It; on the contrary,
it seems to me the best thing In the play.
Zaza's conduct In concealing the hus
band's treachery from his wife Is thor
oughly noble, and quite beyond the ca
pacity of many women whose virtue, as
the poet has said, is more in their mouths
than in their bosoms. The comedy of tne
fourth act Is so ordinary that it requires
all Mrs. Carter's skill to carry It off suc
cessfully; In the hands of most actresses
It would fall quite flat. Not so the tragic
climax of this act, which Is excellently
conceived and thoroughly well worked
cut so far as the part of Zaza Is con
cerned. The break with the lover being
Inevitable, it could scarcely have been
made more logically and more skillfully.
As to the resolution which Mr. Belasco
has given the play (act v). that seems to
me well enough, except that it weakens
what little regard we may have had for
Bernard and makes harder for us the al
ready hard task of believing In the in
tensity of Zaza's passion for a man far
more dishonest than herself. If she grows
better, he grows steadily worse: yet It
Is his Influence that Is supposed to elevate
her. I fear there are more things In

WEDDERSTRAND'S CASE.â The petition of
Charles Wedderstrand for a writ of Injunction
to restrain the California Jockey Club and the
San Francisco Jockey Club from preventing
him from riding for various owners was on
anrument before Judre Sloss yesterday. The
petitioner's counsel -contended that the sus
pension of the Jockey was without cause or
riRht, but upon behalf of the defendants It
was asserted that the action of the board of
stewards must be sustained If It cannot be
shown that it was prejudice against thÂ« pe
titioner, which. It Is averred, was not the caÂ«e.
Judge Sloss has taken the matter under ad
visement.

NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business on the markets here was Impeded to
day by the approach of to-morrow's settle
ment. The news of Colonel Plumer's victory
over General Dewet served to strengthen Kaf
firs to-day but failed to stimulate them into
much activity, and had little effect on the
other departments.
Americans advanced quickly in the early
dealings on the favorable bank statement pub
lished in New York last Saturday, but al
though New York at first accepted higher
prices, in the subsequent transactions the in
fluence of New York was adverse. Union Pacifies
especially weakening. In" the street, however,
there was a recovery all around, influenced
by the receipts of better quotations from Lon
don. There is no present symptom of a cheap
ening of money rates, as heavy calls are due
after the coming settlement.

lied, but broke immediately to 40%c. At the

death by means of the bites they inflict
<>ri human being*. The doctor also said
that epidemics which caused the death of
ro many. Irrespective age, were due to
tha strength of the microbe causing tho
dlp-^ase. which was much greater than
that of the rnlcrobe or germ which de
rdoped the diseases familiar to cvery-day

MANILA, Feb. 2o.-Rev. Father Me-
Klnnon, who was formerly private secre
tary to Mgr. Chapelle, and who is now
pastor of the Ermita Catholic Church, in
formed a correspondent to-day that there
were more than 800 native priests in the
Philippines opposed to the Federal party,
and that these would refuse to adminis
ter the sacrament to Federalists, because
they believed the Federal party, to be
merely a cloak for Protestant attempts to
weaken the power of the church of Rome.
He referred to the Federal party as
"Resting on an insecure foundation and
destined to crumble soon," and asserted
that the Methodist and Presbyterian mis
sionaries were using unfair means to in
duce Filipinos to leave the Catholic faith.
He assailed the character of Senor Buen
camino and other evangelical leaders, and
contended that only by securing the co
operation and good will of the padres
Â«*ould the Americans make permanent
progress in the Philippines.
Senor Tavera, president of the Federal
party, when the views of Father McKln
non were brought to his attention, replied:
j "So much the better, as it will bring the
matter to an issue."
When asked whether the members of
the party would not leave it if they
learned that membership involved their
church standing, Senor Tavera replied:
"They probably would if that were true,
but I believe only a small portion of the
priests would exclude people from their
church privileges for such a reason. We
Filipinos did not make an issue of separa
tion of church and state. This was de
creed by the United States conjtitutlon.
Nothing else is tolerated under American
sovereignty. Whether Federalists approve
cr not, they cannot bo loyalists and yet
oppose that doctrine.
"If the Catholic authorities are not will
ing to accept it, they are not patriotic.
The Federal party may disintegrate after
civil government is generally established
in the Philippines, but the principles of
peace under American sovereignty will
not disintegrate."
Senor Tavera asserted that the Feder
alists who had relatives and friends
among the prominent insurgent leaders
were endeavoring by correspondence to in
duce them to surrender, although thus far
without result.
Some employers of native labor allege
that the natives are gathered by the Fed
eralists wholesale, without any explana
tion of the principles to which they ure
subscribing. Ordinarily the natives are
easily led by their accustomed leader, but
the movement for peace with the United
States has authority and great moment,
and it is now generally understood and
approved by the natives. .. : l â¢;.â¢
Chaplain Fitzgerald administered the
oath of aJlegiance to 200 Ilocanoa at a
church in Vigan on February 22. and a
parish priest at Santa Catalina adminis
tered a similar oath to 70â¬ natives on Feb

district In which the indictment was
found. The defendants are, accordingly,
held to await a warrant of removal to be

No similar proceedings before a United

enormous amount of evidence.

Brown of the United States District Court

The defendants were indicted in Georgia
December 8, 1899, in connection with the
conspiracy charges against Captain Ober

States Jn the matter of harbor and river
improvements on the Atlantic seaboard.
Ten days later proceedings for the de
fendants' removal , were instituted here
before Commissioner Shields. The hearing
lasted for six weeks, during which the
Government Introduced oo evidence. Then
the defendants were held for removal, and
application was made to Judgo Brown for
a warrant of removal. This application
was refused, the refusal causing consider
able surprise. Judge Brown held that the
indictment* was an ex parte document,
and that its mere existence was- not suf

therefore sent the case back to Commis

HAS JURISDICTION
SAVES INDIAN BOY FBOM
TORTURE . BY TRIBESMEN
Captain Cantwell of the Nunivak
Breaks Up ft Pow-Wow and
Protects a Youth.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 25.â A strange
story of superstition and curious customs
of the Northwest Yukon Indians is
brought from the north by the steamer
Amur. Captain Cantwell of the United
States revenue steamer Nunlvak, while
at Nulate early this winter, came upon a
crowd of Nulate Indians holding a pow
wow near that village, and he went over
to the "Illahee" more out of curiosity
than anything else, but on arriving found
that he was Just in time to save an In
dian boy from an awful fate..
The toy while out In the woods with a
companion had accidentally shot and
killed him, and when he came into the
village of his tribe and reported what he
had Â«lone the Shameen or head man of the
tribe was called and ho ordered the boy
seized. The pow-wow was then called,'
and when Captain Cantwell arrived on
the scene it had been -decided that the
only way to make things even for the
death of the boy was to give the boy who
killed him over to the parents of the one
killed, or else to take his life. The boy
had been led into the center of the crowd
by the father of the dead child, and there
was much confusion. It being immediately
after the decision of the Shameen.
It was at this stage that Captain Cant
well arrived, and as there was no one else
present to prevent murder he did so, and
stepping forward to where the boy 'was
held he informed the Shameen and the
rest of the Indiana present that the
United States Government would not al
low such acts to be committed, that if the
boy was guilty he would be punished by
law, and the Government would do the
punishing. If any one else dared to harm
the boy, he said, the Government would
catch him and hang him if it took -years
to do it. The boy was given over to the
protection of the captain, and the Sha
meen was so thoroughly frightened that
he has disappeared.

OAKLAND, Feb. 25.-The City

heated arsrument the deeds were' left un

of the company's property.
The session was supposed to start the
investigation preliminary to the fixing of
water rates for the coming fiscal year.
Mr. Moore, representing the corporation,
opened by announcing that Engineer A,
L. Adams, the water comnany's adminis
trative head, was in Alameda wrestling
with the Town Trustees, but -was within
'call. No one called for Adams, and
Moore, in reply to questions, declared he
was not an expert and could not answer
the demand for information. At last he
produced a batch of 100 deeds, and started

In the midst of the wrangle Engineer

appear in a critical condition. I didn't
expect to be called before you to-night, so

Meese put a motion that the water com

JOINT-SMASHER
BADLY INJURED
Shots Are Exchanged Dar
ing a Raid on a Topeka
Wholesale Houst.
â > Â»
Physician and a Clergyman Ajs
Placed Under Anest and
Charged "With Complicity
in the Affair.
TOPEKA, Feb. 23.-J. W. Adams lies at
a hospital hovering between life and
death. He was shot during a raid last
night on a North Topeka wholesale liquor
house. At midnight a crowd of citizens,
heavily armed with revolvers, sledge ham
mers. " crowbars and a battering ram,
broke Into the wholesale llauor house of
"Cash" Curtis, on West Curtia street, be
tween Kansas avenue and Jackson street,
and smashed the beer casks found there.
Three policemen drove the crowd back.
Both the policemen and the citizens fired
their revolvers, and J. W. Adams, a car
penter, was shot twice in the breast. He
was taken In a hack to Riverside Hospi
tal, where he lies In a precarious condi
tion.
Dr. M. R. Mitchell and Rev. F. W. Em
erson were arrested. 'Rev. Mr. Emerson
was taken to the police station, where hÂ©
was booked under the charge of resisting
an officer. His left hand was cut and
bleeding. He was allowed to go upon his
own recognizance. Dr. Mitchell took the
injured maji to the hospital in a hack.
and was allowed to stay and administer
to him without giving bond.
The three officers. Patrolmen Downey
and Boyles and Private Watchman Con
nors, claim that Adams was shot by his
own crowd while he was retreating f roia
the place where the liquors were smashed,
but Adams says that he was shot by a
policeman. Officer Downey says he did
not arrive at the scene of the trouble until
It was- about over. Officer Boyles. who
carries a Coifs 44-caliber. claims that the
two shots he fired were in the air, and
that he did not aim at any one. Dr.
Mitchell and Dr. Charles W. Hammond,
who cared for Adams at the hospital, say
that he was shot with a 32 or 38 caliber
revolver.
The crowd which did the smashing met
on West Curtis street, about two blocks
from the joint. The estimates of the num
ber vary from thirty to sixty. At a few
moments past 12 o'clock the crowd moved
east on Curtis street to Jackson. The
wholesale liquor house la a small frame
building at the rear of the Curtis home,
which faces on Curtis street. The crowd
turned south on Jackson street and
crossed the rear of the lots between the
street and the liquor house. Half a dozen
men seized the log and used it as a bat
tering ram. The door gave way and the
crowd rushed in. At the first rush the
lantern which the crowd carried was ex
tinguished, and the work was done in the
dark.
Three men stood on the Inside and
passed the cases and kegs of beer to men
in the doorwiy, who threw them Into the
yard to be smashed. The crowd used
heavy sledges, axes, mason's hammer*
and crowbars. The owners of the beer
made no resistance. Patrolman Boyle?
and Watchman Connors were called from
the Union Pacific depot two blocks away,
and were the first officers there. Tney en
tered the yard from Curtis street and
drove the crowd back. Before the officer*
arrived thirty cases and two kegs of beer
had been smashed, and the debris wa<i
spattered over the yard. When the offi
cers arrived the crowd fell back to a ditch
near Jackson street, where the leaders
succeeded in rallying the forces. While
the crowd was being driven back twenty
or thirty shots were fired. When the
crowd retreated to Jackson street the of
ficers were near the building and Adams
was between the officers and the crowd.
When, he was shot he fell by a pile of
wood. When the crowd found that one of
their number had been wounded the other
members quickly dispersed.
LEAVEN WORTH. Kans.. Feb. 25,-ThÂ©
inquest over the killing of Mrs. Rosa Hud
son in the Joint raid at Millwood last Mon
day was held to-day and the Coroner'3
Jury returned a verdict to the effect that
she came to her death from a gunshot
wound at the hands of persons unknown
to the jurors. No attempt was made to
Investigate those who comprised the raid
ing mob or who did any of the shooting
In the joint. John Hudson, the husband;,
Michael Lockner. the brother of the mur
dered woman: Matthew Goens and Dr.
W. K. Adams were the only witnesses put
on the stand, and they were asked only
questions that show that Mrs. Hudaon
is dead and that she was killed by a gun
shot. The jury was out only a few min
utes in reaching a verdict. The prelimi
nary' trial will come up Friday, when a
full examination will be made..
John O. Doane was called upon yester
day in Judge Murasky's court to produce
certain books and documents which, it is
believed by counsel representing the
p':iintiff In the .action instituted by R. P.
MÂ«rlllion against Thomas E. Ryan, J. "W.
Bartholomew and Henry Euler, directors
of the American Box Factory, will throw
light on the purposes for which the Spruce
Package Company was formed. ,
The intangibility. of the Spruce Package
Company is at this time the strongest
argument in its favor. Being neither
company, corporation nor co-partnership,
but iui association organized to control
the box trade of the coast, in violation of
the anti-trust laws of the United States,
the jurisdiction of the State courts over
its members and affairs is questionable.
An attempt to destroy the evidence tend
itij? to prove the unlawful purposes for
which the Spruce Package Company was
formed is alleged to have been made. The
rosult of the call upon Mr. Doane to pro
duce certain, documents and records of
business transactions will hence be await
ed with interest, especially in view of the
fact that Mr. Doane stated that he did not
now have the documents and records in
his possession. He couid not promise to
produce them, but w<fuld try. The fact
that the Spruce Package Company exists
by secret compact left the court without
jurisdiction to order the production of th?
documents, but, as the court stated, if
during the hearing- it develops that certain
documents exist and are being unlaw
fully withheld to the prejudice of the
plaintiff, it will order their production
ajid their custodian must then show cause
why they are still withheld.
When the case was called yesterday At
torney J. li. Roir.stein. who represents thw
defendants, addressed the court and said
that his attention had been called to the
publication of an attempt to destroy -im
portant records bearing on the nature of
the Spruce Package Company. Mr. Rein
stein said he made haste to deny to the
court that he had any knowledge of an
attempt to destroy records.
"And," paid he, "if I was aware that
any one associated with my side of the
case, either as litigant or counsel, was en
paped in any such attempt I would deem
it my duty to withdraw."
Attorney Kaergett of counsel for the
plaintiff explained that he had accused no
one of having made an attempt to destroy
evidence in the case. â¢
At this juncture, however, his associate.
Attorney Barry, entered the court, called
Mr. Doane to the stand and made the de
mand for the records and books of the
Spruce Package Company, two letter
press books known to be in existence be
ing especially required.
Mr. Doane's answer that he did not have
the books in his possession but would try
and produce them left counsel and court
without further remedy. A continuance
was then taken until this morning and It
is with considerable Interest that plain
tiff and his counsel, await the return of
the witness to court this morning.
John O. Doane Says They Are N"ot
in His Possession, but He
Will Try and Bring
Them.
Lawyer Barry Makes De
mand in Court for Their
Production.

probable that "San Jose Charlie," owner

vestigate the alleged charges of crooked-,
ness made against the police, that he waa
never present when a lottery ticket. was
marked. He admitted, however, that- he
was the owner of certain stores in tne

cies. He gave the same testimony before
the Grand Jury.
O. M. Boyle Jr. and his brother. J. M.

that they purchased lottery tickets ln the

peated the story he told the Legislative

APTAI.V HERBERT WINSLOW
/f of the naval transport Solace has
naval vessels as against customs
officers, and in accordance with
his position on that mooted issue he led
the customs Inspectors and the Federal
quarantine officer n merry race frcm the
Golden Gate to Mare Island last Sunday.
On Captain Winslow's previous trip
from Manila to this port customs inspect
ors sei7.ee] a lsrge quantity of smuggled
goods that had betn concealed on board
by officers and men alike. The duties on
these goods amounted to ?2000. Naturally
enough, when the Solace was about to
arrive a*?aln the Federal wuthoritlep were
on the alert. The Solace arrived on Sun
day, but instead of proceeding to the
quarantine grounds to pass the customary
inspection and to Jandthe mall Captain
Wlnslow steamed in through, the Golden
Gate and then proceeded direct to the
navy yard at Mare Island.
The Federal authorities were surprised,
and Quarantine Officer Dr. Kinyoun was
astounded at the daring of the sea officer
in putting his authority at naught. The
quarantine boot Sternberg. with the doc
tor and the customs Inspectors on board,
steamed after the Solace. When' they
reached Mare Island Captain Wlnslow
declared that be would not permit any
customs Inspector to board the vessel

unless he. the captain, were specially or
dered to do so by the Secretary of the
Treasury.
"You can stand on the wharf and watch
the vessel," said the captain, "but you
can't come on board."
Dr. Kinyoun returned on Sunday even
ing with the mail bags that the Soiaco
should have delivered to Station D, at the
ferry landing. Immediately after her ar
rival in port. The customs inspectors re
mained at Mare Island to 'watch for
smuggled goods, and made a written re
port to Surveyor Spear, who In turn re
ported to Customs Collector Stratton. Mr.
Stratton yesterday morning, immediately
upon the receipt of the report of the Sur
veyor, wired a statement of the affair to
the Secretary of the Treasury and agked
for instructions. A reply is expected to
day.
Captain Winslow sent a letter to the
Collector declaring that he would not al
low any dutiable goods to go out of the
ship, that he -would seize all goods that
might be found or attempted to be smug
glad ashore, that he would search his own
ship with his own officers and men, but
that he would not permit a search to be
made by customs officials unless he re
ceived an order from the Secretary of. the
Treasury.
VALLEJO. Feb. 25.â Before noon the
Solace ran alongside the dock here, and
shortly afterward some crockery, choice
vases and other bric-a-brac were taken
ashore by their owners. These did not
escape the watchful eyes oS tha Inspect
ors, and as a result the articles werÂ«
promptly confiscated.
At noon to-day, when Inspectors Lund
quest and Latham came over to tha
Bernard House to dinner, Inspectors
Broderick and Adams were left on duty
at the shia's side.
The commander, before leaving Manila
and Honolulu, gave his men to understand
that no smuggling would be tolerated,
but the Inspectors fear that some of toÂ®
men have disobeyed this order.
Under the law the commander of a man
of-war is recognized as an officer ot tho
customs service, and, therefore, bound to
prevent smuggling. Consequently his Bhip
is exempt from visits of customs officers.
Commander -Wlnslow holds that ttio
Solace Is entitled to such exemption, under
this clause, and that 13 where ho differs
from the customs inspectors.
WASHINGTON*. Feb. 25.â Regarding thÂ«
report that Captain Wlnslow or -the trans
port Solace refused to allow customs In
spectors on board to search, for smuggled
goods. Assistant Secretary Spai<-ing said
to-night that the Treasury Department
could make no statement ln the matter,
as It had no official knowledge of It and
knew nothing of the conditions and cir
cumstances. He said, however, ln a gen-
eral way, that customs Inspectors had a
perfect right to board transports ln search
of dutiable goods. If any misunderstand
ing existed ln the present instance ha
thought it would be straightened out by
the Collector of Customs at San Fran
cisco, without bringing it to the attention
of tha department. ;"., , Â¦'"..,

Beyond the watch maintained by the
customs officers and the life-saving crews
yesterday, no other steps were taken to
recover any bodies which might have
come to the surface.
A trunk with the name "F. Peters" on
It was found floating on the bay during
the afternoon by thÂ«* police patrol. It had
been rifled of its contents.
Two mail sacks from the Rio de Janeiro
were recovered yesterday, one at Salinas
and one af Baker's Beach. Both sacks
contained newspapers from Honolulu.
The only man on the bridpe of the Rio
dc Janeiro who was conversant with the
recent freshets in the rivers and the in
crease of the strength of the ebb tide
last Friday morning was Pilot Frederick
Jordan.
Captain Ward of the Rio de Janeiro cer
tainly . knew nothing as to the recent
heavy rains ln California, consequently he
could make no calculations as to the rate
of speed the ship should maintain to over
come the resistance of the strong ebb
tide.
Maritime calculations show that a cur
rent of six knots would swerve a ship
traveling at the same rate of speed out
of her course.
Pilot Jordan has stated that the Rio
started at half speed and then explained
"half speed" as meaning six knots an
hÂ«ur.
Ordinarily the ebb tld-3 in the bay runs
at the rate of three knots an hour. Ow
ing to the recent heavy rains and the
swollen state of the rivers the ebb tide
has doubled its strength and on the morn
ir.g of last Friday the current was run
ning at six knots an hour.
An important point in connection with
the wreck of the Rio de Janeiro is dis
closed by the reports of the hydrographic
department.
"I am not going to say any more ln re
gard to the wreck," said the pilot, "until
the proper time comes."
A minute laU-r two officials of the com
pany approached Jordan and started a
conversation, -ind- then the pilot refused
to answer further questions.
When asked by a Call representative to
give a further account of the wreck Pilot
Jordan seemed willing to comply with the
request.
Pilot Frederick Jordan left his home
yesterday in response to a requtst made
by some of the Pacific Mall officials and
had a consultation at the Mail dock with
the gentlemen.
"The life-saving men ought to have
known of the Rio coming in. and if guns
had been fire<l it wouli have helped the
pilot and captain of Â«he ship to learn
sometMng as to their course."
"If the crew of the Fort Point station
had. been vigilant they would have had
thÂ«Mr lifeboat at the scene of the wreck in
lÂ«Â»ss than ten minutes. They .were only
three-quarters of a mile east of the spot
where the Rio rtruck, and the strong ebb
tide, running -it six knots an hour, would
have quickly carried the lifeboat up to the
wreck. Possibly fifty or more lives might
have been saved.

by the sound ol her whistle, and when it

On and after April 1 the price for trans
porting hops from all Pacific Coast points
to Eastern marketa will be raised. Some
time ago an emergency rate was made of
$1 W per hundred pounds from the Pacific
Coast to all Eastern cities on account of
the prevalent low prices of the product.
Since then hops have raised in price and
the old rate of $2 per hundred pounds
will be established. This return to the
old rare has been, adopted by all rail
roads doing Pacific Coast business.

given out are as follows:

A railway link of vast Importance and
great value to the Southern Pacific Com
pany has been torn from its system
through the operation of an opinion hand
ed down by Superior Judge Seawell yester
day. .Judge Seawell in his opinion .holds
that the Southern Pacific Company has no
valid title to either estate or franchise
upon .the property upon which its rails
are laid upon Harrison street between
Seventeenth and Twenty-second streets,
and that Its assumption of right of way
across this section of the city Is based
solely upon the suffrance of the people.
Hence the Southern Pacific Company is
denied an injunction to restrain the Board
of Public Works from tearing up the rails
between the streets mentioned, and the
residents of the Mission have won their
first skirmish in the battle to force the
Southern Pacific Company to follow the
bay shore route Into the city.
An ordinance was passed by the Board
of Supervisors directing the Southern Pa
cific Company to abandon its tracks on
Harrison street between Seventeenth and
Twenty-second streets, and to have the
rails removed before July 1, 1901. The or
dinance adjudged the rails upon the line
mentioned a public nuisance, and in event
of the failure of the Southern Pacific
Company to comply with its provisions
the Board of Public Works was directed
to proceed and clear the rails away. The
Southern Pacific Company, shortly after
the enactment of ,the ordinance, filed an
action to restrain the municipal officials
from proceeding to obey the mandates of
the ordinance. This action waa elabor
ately argued before Judge Sea7/ell and
submitted for decision.
The Southern Pacific Company set up
various objections to the ordinance. It
contended that It was illegal because it
arbitrarily declared the tracks to be a
nuisance; that the track was built
through the city in 18C0, prior to the dedi
cation of the property to public use, and
her.ee the corporation's claim to franchise
right. If not to estate in the property, was
upheld.
Though the first contention of/the rail
road company is upheld by Judge Seawell,
who declares that the mere declaration of
the Board of Supervisors adjudging the
track a nuisance does not through opera
tion of law make it so, he proceeds to
sustain the action of the municipal au
thorities upon the theory that the South
ern Pacific Company holds no valid title
to estate or franchise to the disputed ter
ritory. Upon .this point Judge Seawell
says :
While the acts of rÂ«*cosmltlon and acquiesc
ence referred to by the plalntlft in support of
Its claim to right of use of the property In
question may be deemed the equivalent of a
license to maintain the railroad, the license
complained of may also be considered the revo
cation of that license. If the plaintiff had
continued Its ratlroad upon the public street*
on the faith of a license permitting It to do
so. such license would not be removable at
the pleasure of the board after plaintiff had
made expensive improvements upon the faith
thereof. But such license, as Is to be In
ferred from the conduct of the municipal au
thorities, was not given until after the road
was constructed and equipped, arid I do not
eee any reason why the Board of Supervisors
has not the power to make it at Its pleasure.
There is no allegation In the. complaint that
the plalntlft has not some other right of way
over which it may connect its road on Town
send street with that In San Mateo County.
For the present I shall consider only plain
tiff's right to maintain Its railroad across the
streets Just mentioned. Anything which un
lawfully obstruct* the full paÂ«aÂ«e or use in
the customary manner of any t>treet or high
way Is a nuisance per se.
. No la:>se of time can legalize a public nui
sance amount Iiik to an actual obstruction of
public riiht.
If any of the authorities cited by plaintiff's
counsel can be cemstrued as holdins that the
public can be estopped, except In cases where
the party, claiming the benettt of the estopped
has been misled by some affirmative act of
the public authorities, I am not disposed to
follow them.
Even If the defendants are net authorised by
any valid ordinance to remove the plaintiff's
tracks which unlawfully obstruct a public
Btreet, the plaintiff Is not in a position to de
mand the equitable remedy of injunction. A
court of equity will not lend it3 aid to the con
tinuance of an unlawful act. As to the por
tion cf plaintiff's railroad which is between the
charter line of l&ol and the southern boundary
line of the city and county, the complainant
alleges that the land and right of way upon
which said partition wan constructed were pur
chared bv the San Francisco and San Joaquln
Railroad Company at a time when the same
was private property and long lx>fore any pub
lic streets or highways had neÂ«n laid out.
used or dedicated as or declared to be such
public streets. That allegation is not denied
by any affidavit or answer on the part of de
fendants, and muet, for the purpose of the
motion, be taken as true.
The demurrer to complaint will, however, be
overruled and plaintiffs motion for an injunc
tion will be granted, except as to such propor
tions of Its railroad as are upon Seventeenth.
Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth and Twen
ty-flm etreeto, as to which the motion will be
denied.
An appeal to the Supreme Court will
be taken forthwith by the Southern Pa
cific Company. Unless* such actloh is
taken, which will act as a stay, the Board
of Public Works may. if it sees fit, re
move the tracks within the territory out
side the Injunction issued by the court â
that is, the tracks upon Seventeenth.
Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth and
Twenty-first streets and up to Twonty
second street. The rest of the road south
to the county line is protected by the in
junction, but the opinion does not touch
upon the validity of the plaintiff's title
to the land involved, even though the
protection of the court is given.
In His Opinion Right of Way in Mis
sion District -is Based Solely
Upon SufiE ranee of
People*
Denies Southern Pacific an
Injunction to Prevent'
Removal of Rails.
