jj- ONDON. Jan. SO.â The Queen's
if funeral procession In London, as
'â¢\ indicated by the War Office
Â¦' * l " t *^ orders Issued this evening, will be
a porgeous military pageant. De
tachments of forty regiments, with an
almost equal number of distinctive uni
forms embracing all arms of the service.
will make a constantly changing picture.
The uniforms of all the great armies of
the world will appear, for in addition to
the brilliant entourages of the visiting
kings and princely envoys there will be
the military attaches of the embassies
and legations.
All the field marshals of the army able
to endure the fatigue will ride with their
staffs. The naval corps will also take
part In the procession, which will be two
miles long.
The War Office directs that Beethoven's
and Chopin's funeral marches only fhall
be played. From the time the coffin
reaches London to its departure puns will
slowly boom in Hyde Park.
Londoners are just awakening to the
full proportions of the obsequies and the
result of days of mourning which, to
numerous tradesmen and others means
absolute closure, and is causing conster
nation. Suddenly to stop every industry
in the United Kingdom and to turn the
maswF Into the streets with millions hop
ing- to concentrate all along the two miles
of the procession is an undertaking which
has begun to be fully appreciated by the
police, but the public of London is dis
mayed to find that all the great markets,
Covent Garden. Smithfield and others,
where the food of the metropolis is sup
plied, are to be absolutely closed at the
*>nd of the week. The railways of the
Tnlted Kingdom will reduce their ar
rar.rementa to the Sunday schedules.
Ttestaurants and bars will be shut, and
the crowds will have to wander in the
streets. London Is a world In Itself, living
from hand to mouth, and the closing of
the accustomed avenues for the supply
and distribution of food, drink and amuse
ment from Friday to Monday* means a
loss and inconvenience that no American
city could appreciate.
Th* newspapers protest against the lack
of arranpempnU for the press in London
and Windsor. Householders along the

thousands of every rank from flocking to

COUNT VON WALDERSEE'S
PLANS FOR EVACUATION
ANTHONY, Kans., Jan. SO.â Mrs. Nation
was outdone, here to-dav when a band of
W. C. T.'U. women, headed by Mrs. Sher
iff of Danville, Kans., completely
wrecked the fixtures of four "joints,"
smashing plate-glass windows and mir
rors and turning gallon after gallon of
liquor Into the streets. The women, who
were of the best families in Anthony,
were accompanied by their husbands, sons
or brothers, who assured protection. No
arrests were made, and the band will. It
Is said, start out to-morrow morning on a
tour of destruction through Harper Coun
ty, which is prolific m saloons.
Mrs. â¢ Sheriff, who led to-day's raid, la
under bond to appear nt Danville in April
to answer a charge cf saloon-wrecking
placed against her six weeks ago. ,Mrs.
Sheriff came to Anthony late yesterday
arid worked all night, procuring hatchets
and other implements of destruction, and
It was 2 o'clock this morning before she
had perfected plans for the raid. The
women began their attack shortly after
daybreak, taking the saloon-keepers and
the town officials by surprise.
| Among the brigade were two or three
schoolgirls under age, N who did some of
the 'most effective smashing. A greater
part of the havoc was finished before the
police or Mayor were aware of what was
going on. The actual damage to personal
property, aside from the liquor destroyed,
is placed by the saloon-keepers at $2000.
. For a'tlme the whole town was In an
uproar, and it was feared that personal
violence would result. The first place at
tacked was situated in the rear of a drug
stote, which was forcibly entered from the
rear. It contained costly bar fixtures
and a valuable cash register. "Within a
few minutes the women had smashed
everything in sight, but In their hurry to
finish this job and go to other places they
overlooked the bulk of the liquor stored
away.
Half a block down the street the sec
ond scene of Joint-smashing was enactei.
They found this saloon locked, but axes
were applied and the whole glass front
was smashed In. Here their work was
more complete. The .building, a great
plateglass mirror and everything in sight
was reduced to the maximum of the Mr*.
Nation Idea. The proprietor was smashed
on the head with a. beer bottle and his
â¢blood 'railed with tlie flow of liquor? over
the floor.
In quick succession two other, places a
short distance down the street were sub
jected to similar treatment, the fixtures
smashed and all the liquor turned into the
gutter.'
The women then prayed within sight of
the wreckage they had spread. One wo
man, in an appeal to the Almighty, asked
that he guide them to other dens of In
iquity and direct their footsteps to rum
cursed towns in. Kansas. This prayer was
Interpreted to mean that the Anthon-,'
women would extend their crusade and
word was hurriedly tent over the tele
phone wires to adjacent towns by local
saloon sympathizers who wished to warn
their fellow jointists. No arrests were
made.
As a seauel to the raid a number of
young men and two or three small boys
became drunk. During the excitement
they had followed the crusaders into the
saloons and secured a quantity of whisky,
wine and beer.
The young men of Parkdale, a suburb
of Topeka. have organized what they call
a "Hatchet Club." They favor Mrs. Na
tion and her mode of closing saloons.

TOPEKA. Kans.. Jan. 30.â Mrs. Carrie
Nation to-day organized a band of forty
six women to follow her leadership and
assist In wiping out joints. The band was
formed at a mass meeting of women
called by Mrs. Nation and presided over
by her at the Presbyterian church. Every
seat was occupied. Mrs. A. F. Dumenll
was elected local president and Mrs. Wil
liam Usher secretary. These women will
take charge of the work in Topeka dur
ing Mrs. Nation's absence. The others
agree to follow the crusader wherever
she. may lead and to do her biding at a
moment's notice. Mrs. Nation announced
that they would go ahead regardless of
the W. C. T. U. They would, she said,
give warning before resorting to violence.
Remarkable enthusiasm was displayed at
the meeting and Mrs. Nation was cheered
to the echo.
Robert F. McCulloch. County Attorney
of Harper County, was In Topeka to-day
and appeared surprised at the report of
the joint smashing at Anthony.
"I have not been able to close the Joints
in Harper or Anthony because the city
authorities favqr them," said he. "They
told me it was none of my business and
I have not made a detective of myself."
, Mr. McCulloch appeared to be pleased at
the course things have taken at his home.
. Chief of Police Stahl announced to-night
that when Mrs. Nation raided a joint
here he would arrest her so as to make
a test case. He wants to|ascertaln If a
saloon-keeper has any rights under the
law and if saloon property can be pro
tected.
TO START COUNTER CRUSADE.
Question of Prohibition Again to Be
Passed to the Legislature.
WICHITA, Kans.. Jan. 30.â At a private
meeting of business men held here to
night a. suggestion was made that may
solve the problem of how to meet the cru
sade started by Mrs. Nation. The sug
gestion is to open a counter crusade
against the prohibitory law and immedi
ately ask the /Legislature now in session
to resubmit.the prohibitory amendment to
a. vote of ; the 'people. .This, it is thought,
would open up the question of saloons or
no saloons in Kansas for legitimate dis
cussion outside ' of hatchets and stove
shakers.' "Wichita business men think the
time has been made ripe by the action of
Mrs. Nation and the Anthony crusaders
for the Legislature to take action on the
question of resubmisslon, which all Leg
islatures have dodged for twenty years.
Representative Lullng and Senator Tapp
will each receive a resubmisslon resolu
tion from Wichita to-morrow.

LORD ROSEBERY'S EULOGY.
Says Victoria- Was the Chief of
European Sovereigns.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â Lord Rosebery pre
sided at a special meeting to-day of
Royal Scottish Corporation, called in Lon
don to pass resolutions expressing sorrow
at the death of Queen Victoria and con
gratulations on the accession of King Ed
ward VII. There was a. large attendance.
Nearly all the Scottish Lords were pres
ent.
Lord Rosebery, remarking .. that Â¦- he
would pass lightly over the congratula
tory part of the programme, said his Ma
jesty's speech at the Privy Council meet
ing sufficiently indicated the laws by
which he Intended his reign should, be
governed, thus promising to make his rule
no less Illustrious than that of his parent.
Lord Rosebery then dwelt In eloquent
terms en the life and death of Queen' Vic
toria, saying that In the whole history of
mankind no dtath had touched such a
large number of persons. There \ was
scarcely an intelligent individual in the
civilized world but was profoundly moved.
He wondered If her subjects yet realized
how much they had lost, and what an
enormous weight the Queen had in the
councils of the world. It was not bril
liancy or genius which could supply the
advantages she gave Great Britain, but
her fund of knowledge, which was un
equaled by any constitutional historian.
It was no disparagement of other kjngs
to say she was the chief of European
sovereigns and her influence in the coun
cils of nations was always used for
peace, freedom and good government.
Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal sec
onded the resolutions.

MENTO. Jan. 30.â The second
reading of Assembly bill 190, ex
empting portions of the property
of Stanford University from tax
ation, precipitated a lively tilt In the As
sembly. After a heated debate an amend
ment offered by Guilfoyle, striking out
the lines providing for exemption from
taxation of bonds held by the university.
was defeated by a vote of 27 ayes and Â«
noes, and .by a vote of 47 to 13 the bill was
passed to the third reading.
Guilfoyle offered the amendment In ac
cordance with the wishes cf the Feder
ated Mission Improvement Clubs of San
Francisco. Wright of Santa Clarx, wha
introduced the bill, opposed the amend
ment. He said the people had adopted theÂ»
Stanford University constitutional amend
ment by a much . larger vote than was
given any other amendment; that the uni
versity authorities were asking much less
than they were warranted In asking un
der that amendment, and that the As
sembly would only be carrying out the
will of the people respecting a great edu
cational Institution If it should vote down
Guilfoyle'9 amendment.
Sutro said the object of the bill was to
enable 'the university to make profitable
Investments in local bonds. The adoption
of the amendment would simply force tha
investment of some millions of dollars In
foreign bonds, the State losing the advan
tages- of the employment here of that
much capital.
Cowan favored the amendment, assert
ing that the State had been liberal in
Its treatment of Stanford Kniverslty and
the treatment had not been returned- in
kind. He favored the exemption of the
university's real estate now, with a delay
of two years before its bonds should ba
exempted also.
"The University of California," said
Brown of San Mateo. "is supported by
the people of the State for the Bame pur
poses for which Stanford is supported by
private munificence. We are asked to ap
proximate sums fkggtega.tlns nearly $250,
000 in addition to the regular income of
the State University. The people, de
manding liberal treatment of the one.
have a!so expressed their wish for liber
ality toward the other In the manner ex
pressed in this bill. By votUtg down this
amendment you will be acting for the best
Interests of the cause of education and
at the same time carrying out the will
of the people."
Bauer, Walker and Wright spoke In op
position to the amendment Schleslnger
added his voice to the opposition to the
exemption of bonds. The vote indicates
that the. bill will pass^ by a large ma

explain. . .
' He explained that he sold the exhibits,
not at public auction, but after he had ob
tained offers from three or four firms."
The offer of $460 was the largest and he
accepted that. It was all he could get
for an exhibit that, in one way or an
other, had cost the State $116,000.
Attorney General Tlrev L. Ford wai
brought into the case at thla point, to tell
what advice he had Riven the commis
sioners about the limits of the phrase
"traveling expenses." Gasklll had said
upon the stand that Ford had given it as
his opinion that traveling expenses in
cluded hotel bills, and Ford partially cor
roborated this by 3aylng that' he and
Foote agreed practically upon this Inter
pretation: but he said he had given no
definite opinion. He was asked if he wou>d
advise the committee, and he -said he
would be glad to, but he asked that they
communicate with him In writing and
allow him to file a written opinion, as thj
law directs.
Then Emlay returned to the stand to
tell of the medals. He said ho had writ
ten to exhibitors at his own suggestion,
and that he had taken sole charge of the
medals. He said Oore's schedule of $3 60
for a silver medal. 50 cents for a bronze
one, and $12 for a gold one referred to the
medals to be Issued by the Government.
These, he said, would not be issued for a
long time, but In the meantime a man
named Lathaun Aine of 50 Avenue Bos
quet. Paris, had obtained from the French
Government the right to issue imitations
of the official medals, and it was*these he
had purchased. He showed a printed price
list which listed these medals as follows:
Silver-plated. $15; bronze. $10; heavy gilt.
$20. Emlay was asked why he had charged
$20 for bronze, $25 for sliver and $30 for
gold, and he said it was because he had
procured a medal of Detter quality thaa
that scheduled. He showed a receipt
which read:
7 grand prlxs, at $35 $243
28 gold medals, at $30 ;.... S4O
9 silver medals, at $25 223
4 bronze medals, at $20 joo
Total $!.Â«->
No one on the committee seemed to no
tice the discrepancy of the last Item
four bronze medals at $20 each, making a
total of ?100. f
There was a note at the bottom of the
receipt saying the medals had been deliv
ered on Emlay's signature and without
certificates. Emlay was questioned close
ly about . the whole transaction, but he
would go no further than to say that he
had paid the amount the receipts showed
nnd that,: while he knew nothing of the
value of the medals themselves, he was
sure they had cost him all he had asked
for them.
The investigation will continue to-mor
row.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 30.â But for a row
with Foote, and his subsequent ar
rest by a sergeant at arms, the
Investigation of the Paris Com
mission to-day would have been-unleav
ened by Interest and dry as a column of
figures. It is true Varney Gasklll was
on the stand, but beyond being quick and
plausible in his explanation, his testi
mony had only the effect of passing on
to Emlay what had been passed on to
him, and when the committee adjourned
for the night Emlay was still attempting
to pass into thin air the charges and
statements that had come far enough
down the line to reach him. His efforts
met but' Indifferent success.
The row with Foote came up over a
question propounded by Melick regarding
the award to the Alaska Packers' Asso
ciation. The association had been given
a silver medal, and. apropos, of an at
tempt on the part of the commission to
raise this to a gold medal, Melick asked
Gasklll, who was on the stand, if either
he or Mr. Foote had any stock in the
company.- Foote was sitting in the cen
ter of the hall, and he spoke up at once:
"Yes, I have fifty shares, and I am
going to keep them," he said, and then,
despite the pounding of the chairman's
gavel, he went on: "I know that clipping
you are reading from and I say the state
ments made in it are lies."
But the committee had its experience
the day before, and was not* to be talked
at
"I move that the sergeant at arms take
charge of Mr. Foote," said Melick.
"I second the motion," said Treadwell,
and Bliss, with evident reluctance, put the
motion. Melick end Treadwell voted
"aye," and there were no noes. Then
there was a pause.
"I want .to know what has become of
my motion," demanded Melick.
"I called for votes and no one voted,"
said Bliss.
"Call the roll, then." suggested Melick,
and the roll was called, with the result
that Bliss alone voted "no."
There was another nause. and the pro
cedure being a new one, nobody seemed
willing to suggest anything until Melick
asked that the sergeant at arms be in
structed to inform Mr. Foote of the order
of the committee. The sergeant at arms
stepped gingerly forward and did not

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MEXTO, Jan. 30.â Belshaw's measure,
known as the anti-poolroom bill, was
passed upon unfavorably by the Senate
Committee on Corporations to-night. After
a long consideration of the bill, whh ar
guments by its advocates, the committee
went into executive Besslon and very
promptly decided to report the bill with
the recommendation that it do not pass.
The vote stood 7. to 1, Senator Selvage
alone voting in the affirmative. Simpson,
Flint, Muenter, Onnal. Leavitt, Currier,
Cutter and, Ashe voted against a favora
ble recommendation. Lukens, Bettman,
Welch and Nutt were absent.
L. S. Beedy and W. G. Morrow . were
present, representing the Bausallto Mu
nicipal Improvement Club. They pre
sented arguments In favor of Belshaw's
bill. Their complaint was that the pool
room men were able to colonize a suffi
cient number of men in the community
to be able to defeat the will of the bona
fide residents. In Â¦ consequence the State
would b,e justified in interfering by means
of the legislation embodied in the Belshaw
b*H. Â¦ .
Senator Belshaw, the author of the Sen
ate bill, and Atherton. who introduced thÂ«
bill in the Assembly, were both present
and defended the measure.
Senators Leavitt and Ashe took promi
nent parts in opposition to the bill. They
contended that, however desirable antl
poolroom legislation might be, it, ought to
emanate only from the local legislative
body, leavitt said- that while . undoubt
edly a large number of admirable people
in Sausalito were opposed to the pool
rooms, evidently a majority of the peoplo
were not. â¢â If . they wero they coultf ahut
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Regarding the official price list Vwhich
Melick showed yesterday. Gasklll said, he
had never seen anything like it before.
He knew of no 6uch list In Paris and the
first one he ever saw was. that which
Melick showed. .'... .' ..-.'., â¢
The receipt given for wine to the South
ern California . Wine Association, which
Melick showed yesterday, was cited by
Gasklll as the only receipt of its kind he
was compelled to give. Part of this wine,
he said, was exhibited and the remainder
was given to the judges. That portion
which was exhibited was sold and the
company, Gasklll .said, would be paid
when the accounts were made up. There
Is now in- the commissioners' safe. $460 â
receipts for the sale of fittings and ex
hibits, which. will be paid to exhibitors.
When -he was -questioned about his trips
out of Paris Gaskiil feaid:
"When I went to Paria first I arranged
for the furnishing and fitting of the
rooms; The man who had the work in
charge said it would take three weeks,
and I thought It would be a good oppor
tunity, to â¢ see the south of France, so
with my wife and Mr. Dargie 1 took a
trip from February 2t> to March 10. This
was at the advice of and with the consent
of Mr. Truman, who .was the only com
missioner in Paris at the time. He said
he would look out for my work while I
â¢was away, aqd, as the rooms were closed,
there was no work for Mr. Dargie. The
expense of the trip 1 bore out of my. own
pocket."
Melick then asked how Gasklll got his
appointment and Gasklll answered that
he supposed it was by the favor of the
commissioners. Â¦ >
"I tried to get the position through
friends," Gaskill admitted.
"What powers did they give you?"
asked Melick. , Â¦'
"They gave me power to collect this ex
hibit, and see it properly installed."
"Was there any resolution on the sub
ject?" . -i \
"No, isir." " ! .
"When did- they- give you a chance to
get hold of this money?!'
â¢Gasklll objected to the expression,
"chance to get hold of this money,", and
went on to explain that he never handled
any money except In Paris, when he was
given 5000 francs at a time, and these he
deposited at once. All his business, he
said, was transacted by checks. His own
expenses "before he went to Paris, he ex
plained, were paid by. himself and at tMe
end of the month his bills were approved
by the commission and he was reim
bursed.
In reference to- the selling of the ex
hibit, Gaskill said he. told Loeb, one of
the attaches, to do the best he cduld with
it, and he finally found a man who would
take the whole thing for $460. There was
much inquiry about' the wine exhibit and
where It all went to. but Gasklll was hazy
on the subject.
"Then you don't know If It was drank
up?" said Melick, with a reckless disre
gard of grammar; and not to be .outdone
ln grammatical license Gaskill positively
replied: ;â¢-Â»...
"Yes; I do know for a certainty that It
was not drank up." .
The case of the Sacramento River Pack
ing Company A and the Alaska Packers'
Association, the one that caused Foote
to be thrown into custody, was peculiar.
The River Company had written to Sen
ator Belshaw, who turned the letter over
to the committee, that It had heard from
Paris that it had been given a gold medal.
Then it heard it was on.y a medal Of sil
ver and then It dropped to one of bronze.
Then the company heard that the Alaska
Association had been given' first a' silver
medal, then a re-examination, and then
a gold medal. After Melick's question
about stock, ard the Foote suppression,
Gaskill denied that he ever had a share In
the company and then explained how the
medals were changed. It was a large com
pany, he said, and a California company,
and he thought if it were possible to ob
tain a re-examination of its exhibit it
would be given a gold medal. The re-ex
amlnatlon was obtained and the gold
medal was forthcoming, much to the cha
grin of the River Company, which de
clares its bronze medal salmon is selling
for $1 50 a case, where the Association sal
mon brings but $1 10. - Â¦ t
'tWas any such effort made in behalf of
the Sacramento River Company?" asked
Melick, and It developed that there was
none. ..â¢.â¢:â¢'; ,
- Gasklll was then questioned on his ef
forts while in Paris to obtain the Amer
ican agency of some French 1 wines. He
did negotiate with a French champagne
firm until it got out a label with Gasklll's
name emblazoned upon it, but the nego
tiations fell through. Then Gasklll sought
the agency of an ale, but unsuccessfully,
and finally he obtained the agency of a
Scotch whisky. .-*-Â¦/
L. A. Emlay followed Gaskill. He
came to the stand loaded with the sins
that had been passed on down from Run
yon to Foote, from Foote to Gasklll and
from Gaskill to Emlay, and in his hour's
examination he did not do much toward
passing them further.
Emlay was first questioned about" his
letter offering to "care" for exhibits, and
he admitted that he hart""bverstepped. his
limits and had been "called down" for it.
Ho explained that none of the agencies
which he wished Â¦ to . establish for ex
hibitors was to come into effect until
after the exposition, and the committee
neglected to ask'him-why one of his con
tracts, which, he said, was like all the
others, stated, that It should last only
while the exposition wasJn progress. .
The Davidson . specimen, which was
know just what to do. " He hesitated a
moment and. Foote eved him a moment.
Then the humor of the thing burst upon
the prisoner and he laugheu long and
loud, as did everybody in" the room but
the commltteemen. Before the laughter
had subsided Foote and â the sergeant at
arms were shaking hands.
"I'm in custody, am I?!' demanded Foot?
of his captor, and the" 'crowd laughed
again.
This thoroughly exasperated Mehck,
who moved that should Foote annoy again
the sergeant at arms should. forthwith re
move him from the room. In the mean
time Foote had quieted down, and when
the motion was put and carried he re
marked that it was better to flee tempta
tion, so he invited the sergeant -U arms
out for a drink. This did not end matters,
however, for when the adjournment was
taken Porter Ashe advised the sergeant
at arms to learn Just where he stood, and
under Ashe's suggestion he addressed the
committee, saying that he was responsible
for Foote's board and lodging and his ac
tions, and he wished the committee to as
sume responsibility. The committee saw
the force of the situation and ordered
Foote discharged 'from custody.' "
Varney Gasklll, secretary of the com
mission, was called to the stand at 2
o'clock. He told of his appointment and
of his origin*] salary and then of the
raise to $300. which, he showeu by his
minutes, was made on motion of Truman,
seconded by Foote. Yesterday Foote said
he did not know of the raise until afteÂ»*
the other commissioners had agreed upon
it. Gaskill admitted having worked to
get the position- of -secretary, but denied
that he had lobbied for the bill, xie said,
when reminded that he was a constant at
tendant at the Legislature by which the
Paris Commission act was passed, that ha
was lobbying for the election oi Burns to
the Senate.
Then Treadwell questioned the witness
about the medals and Gaskill said that
when he wrote the first letters regarding
medala he did not know what the French
Government was charging for them and
he made no price. He wrote 135 or 150 of
these, and then, having been given the
prices of medals "by Kmlay he included
them in a second series of letters. He
did not know where Emlay got the price,
because he. thought the matter was in
Emlay's charge. The prices quoted were:
For a grand prix. $00; a gold medal, $25;
a silver medal, $20, and a bronze medal,
$15. When they were made double $5 was
added to each.
Gaskill received hi response to these
letters about sixty checks and these he
indorsed and turned over to Emlay. He
knew that Emlay purchased the medals,
but he had no official knowledge of the
fact. The letters quoting the prices were
shown to the commissioners.

Another new section provided by thÂ«
bill reads as follows:
Any person or any officer cr member of any
association, board, committee or corporation,
who publishes by any writing or printing, that
Asiatic cholera or the bubonjc plaerue exists,
or has recently existed within this State, un

of u. felcr.y.
The third new section provides that
uppn the verification of the State Board
of Health of any case of Asiatic cholera
or of bubonic plagrue within the State its
secretary must, when directed by such
board, enter upon its minutes its deter
mination that such cholera or plague
exists and must forward a copy of such
determination, certified by him. to each
of the local boards of health and to the
Board of Health of each State in the
United States and also to the United
Treasury Department at Washington.
Any secretary of such State Board of
Health of this State who falls to comply
with any of the provisions of this sec
tion is grulltjf of a misdemeanor. â¢
In a second bill an appropriation of
tlOO.OOO is provided, to be expended by the
Btate Board of Health, under the direc
tion of the Governor, for the prevention
of the introduction of Asiatic cholera, bu
bonic plague*, smallpox or other conta
g-ious or infectious disease within this
State, and for their suppression in cai-e
of their origin or introduction. It is pro
vided that the claims for expenditures
shall be audited by the Board of Examin
ers", except when, in the opinion, of the
Governor, an emergency arises Â¦which de
mands or necessitates the Immediate use
of the money, and in that case it is pro<
vided that the Controller must draw his
warrant in the name of the Governor,
without auditing-, for sums not exceeding
iUM at any time the Governor may direct.
The vouchers for sums so drawn must
afteward be filed with the Controller,
showing the manner and the purposes for
Â¦which such sums have been cxiÂ»nii<>H.
a tnira diu proviaes tms new section
to be added to the Political Code:
It it the duty of even' local Board of Health
and of each of the members thereof, and of
every Coroner, and other public officer know-
Ing, or having reason to believe, that any case
cf Asiatic cholera or of bubonic plague exit-ts
cr has recently existed within the city, city
and county, town, township or county of* which
he it an officer, or of which FU"h local Board of
Health is an official body, to at once report
euch car* to the State Board of Health, which
may thereupon take such measures as it may
deem necessary to ascertain whether such cape
of cholera or plarue exists, or has so existed,
and to prevent the further rpread of such con
tagion, and to that end, such State Board may
if It deems proper take possession and control
cf the body of any living or the-corps^'of any
deceased person which is or has been afflicted
â¢with either of such diseases, and may direct
and take such means as It may deem expe
dient to arrest the further spread of such dis
ease or diseases.
In both houses this latter bill was re
ferred to the Health Committees and In
the Assembly preparations for its im
mediate cohFlderation were made. Type
written copies were presented to each
member, and then the committee shut it
self up In executive session with Pendle
ton. In a short time it was announced
that the bill would be favorably recom
mended to the Assembly to-morrow morn
ing. N'o time had been lost.
The bill has two objects: to center in
the Governor ana the State Board of
Health most of the power that now be
longs to the local boards, and to re
establish the State quarantine service in
San Francisco, that has been supplanted
by the Federal authorities.
The effect on local Boards of Health
will be to practically y.ij>e them out of
existence in any case of emergency, or to
make them no more than sanitary police
to assist the State board. Whenever they
find anything they must report it and
ptep aside, leaving the State board in
charge.
The fight between the FcderU and the
fitate quarantine services has been coins
on for some years. Taking advantage of
some laxity in the State 'service, the Fed
eral Government tock charge iinder the
law which allows the Federal Government
to establish a quarantine wherever and
whenever a State ceases to maintain an
efficient service. It is some years since
the Federal authorities took charge, bu*
ever since they have held their place In
defiance of all efforts to dislodge them
The effect of the bill will be to put the
Etate service once more into operation

It "Would Appear That I.ocal Berne-
dies Would Be Best for Cure
of Catarrh.
. ' It would seem at Arst g-lance that
catarrh, being a disease of the mucous
membrane, salves, sprays, etc., being
applied directly to the membranes of the
nose and throat would be . the most ra-
tional treatment, but this has been proven
not to be true.
The mucous membrane Is made and re-
paired from ihe bfood and catarrh la a
blood disease and any remedy to make a
permanent cure must act on the blood,
and when the blood Is purified from ca-
tarrhal poison, the secretions from tf.e
mucous membrane will become j natural
and healthy.
. In this climate thousands of people seem
scarcely ever free from some form of
catarrh: It gets better at times, but each
winter becomes gradually deeper seated
and after a time the sufferer resigns him-
self to it as a necessary Â¦evil.
' Catarrh cures are almost as numerous
as catarrh sufferers, but are nearly all so
inconvenient and Ineffective aa to render
their use a nuisance .nearly as annoying
as catarrh itself; any one who has used
douches, sprays and powders will bear
witness to their inconvenience and failure
to really cure.
There are fa number of excellent internal
remedies for catarrh, but probably the
best and certainly the safest Is a new
remedy, composed of eucalyptol, hydras-
tls, sangulnarla and other valuable ca-
tarrh specifics. â¢ (
This remedy Is In tablet form, pleasant
to the taste and sold by druKKiats under
the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and
any one suffering from catarrh may use
these tablets with absolute assurance that
they contain no cocaine, opiate nor any
poisonous mineral whatever.
A leading druggist In Albany, speaking
of catarrh cures, says: "I have sold va-
rious catarrh cures for years, but have
never sold any which Rave nuch ireneral
satisfaction as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
They contain in a pleasant, concentrated
form all the best and latest catarrh reme-
dies, and catarrh sufferers who have used
douches, sprays and salves have been
astonished at the quick relief and perma-
nent results obtained -after a week a usa
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets. All drug-
gists sell full sized packages for BO centa.

SAN JOSE, Jan. 30.â The fight now be
ing .waged over the estate of the late
Adam Sweigert developed the fact to
day that the deceased once had himself
examined by a number of doctors to as
certain his own mental condition. In this
suit Caroline Schmoll and other heirs are
suing Jonathan Sweigcrt, a son and
executor of the estate, to have him return
to the estate more than $100,000 which, it
Is alleged, he has appropriated to his own
use.
Thomas Magee, a real estate man .of
San Francisco, was on the stand for the
defense. He said that, pending the sale
by Adam Sweigert of a piece of Kearny
street property, W. T. Sweigert, one of
the contestants, had visited' him and said
the sale must not proceed, as the old
gentleman was' crazy. Magee repeated
this to Adam Sweigert. and the latter
was highly Indignant. He then called in
a number of doctors to make an exam-,
ination of his mental condition and they
pronounced Adam Sweigert mentally
competent, W Â¦

the issues raised is that Adam Sweigert

the men in the association who, he said,
were, in tho interest of a great Irriga

force of the association by diverting its
purposes from a complete transfer of the
water power of the .State to a feeble

panies. If tho purpose of the association,
he said, was- to improve the Irrigation

On Friday he went down town to buy
tickets to Great Falls, Mont. Later in
the day he was at the station and ad

there met a stranger. ' He telephoned to
his wife that he had met a man he once
knew in Los Angeles and was going to
Tacoma with him. saying that he would
be back that evening or the next morning.
On Sunday Mrs. Orr had friends in Ta
coma look for him, but he had not been
seen there. His goods are still at the
station. None of the ticket agents re
members having seen him.
While in San Francisco Orr was em
ployed by the Shasta Water Company.
He previously had been employed on a
street railway In Los Angeles. He had
paved considerable money and with his
wife concluded to come to Seattle for a
short vacation. He was promised work
in Great Falls and intended to go there
in a few days.
The search for the- missing: man has
been taken up by the police of Seattle
and Tacoma, but nothing has been
learned as to the identity of the stranger

He carried when last seen a valuable
watch and a heavy linked gold chain. -

pioneer storekeeper at the old mining
camp of Todds Valley, twenty miles above

over' the head with a pistol, bound hand
and foot, robbed and thrown into a cellar
by two strangers. Although Quirolo had
considerable money, the robbers were able
to find only $10.
Last evening at dusk Deputies Coon and
Dependener ran across the ' robbers in the
forest near Butcher ranch and pistol shots
were exchanged. One of the men was
found this morning in the canyon by
Supervisor McAunlch and Sheriff Keena.
He had been wounded in the leg by the
deputies during the fight.
The prisoner gives his name as Linton
and his confederate's as Marshall. Both
have many aliases and are ex-convicts.

HAVANA, Jan. 30.â Charles F. W. Xee

Finance of the Cuban Postoffice Depart

X. Y., in May last, charged with embez
zling $36,000 of the department's funds, has
arrived here on the steamship Mexico
from Xew York. Captain Lucien Young,
captain of the port, took charge of the
prisoner and delivered him to the keeper

NZELY CONFIDENT
i' OF HIS ACQUITTAL
HAVANA, Cuba. Jan. 30.â The present
temper of the Cuban people is against tha
United ', States protectorate, but this
should not be taken as conclusive of tlieir
final judgment.
The feeling is partly due to the belief
that American officials are obstructing
the work of the convention In order to
prevent it from adopting a constitution In
time for action by- Congress. This has
created an anti-American feeling, espe
cially in towns which are the centers of
political agitation, and has spurred the
delegates with their work.
The hostility has -been- deepened by the
assertion, of American capitalists and
military officers that the United States
would pigeonhole the constitution for u
year and then reject It. .
The result has been to give full control
to the Radicals. â¢ who have drafted and
will soon adopt a constitution wÂ»uch has
no suggestion of a protectorate.
Most of the delegates violently resented
to-day intimations that Washington ex
pected a protectorate, but their real sen
timents may be disclosed later when the
relations of Cuba with the United States
are formulated. Some of tnem. in pri
vate sessions of the convention, when the
first draft of the constitution was dis
cussed, favored leaving out an" provision
for an army and navy and the inclusion
of specific arrangements with the Unitcl
States for a military reservation and
naval stations as well as an exclusive
commercial treaty, but they yielded to the
pressure of Radical ooinions. If senti
ment develops for a protectorate It wt'.l
come from the joint action of the business
community and the country people. Un
til recently commercial classes have re
fused to believe that the United States in
tended to carry out the joint resolution
passed by Congress. They are confused
and disturbed^ but when they see steps
actually takenNthey will combine to in
fluence members of the convention to
reach some understanding with the Amer
ican Government. That moment haa be
gun. The country people have been dis
trustful of annexation and suspicious of
the American policy, but are not unfriend
ly and they do not seem to- want the
TInited States authority entirely with
drawn.

CUBANS OPPOSE
A PROTECTORATE
A Washington dispatch says the saline
bill is with the Secretary of the Interior.
He will soon report it back to the Presi
dent with his approval or disapproval.
The President had ten days In which
to sign It and. unless he did so it would
then become a. law. On the other hand,
just as soon as he signed it the bill be
came the law. The rival factions at Sal
ton are ready to locate claims the very
minute the word is received that the bill
has either been signed or has become a
law. by lapse of time. The parties most
at interest are on the ground and when
the word does come .that the signature
haB been affixed, to the bill a college foot
ball rush will be tape In comparison with
the manner in which the two, gangs of
men in the employ of the New Liverpool
and Standard salt companies will grab
the land.
The injunction obtained from the River
side court to restrain the representatives
from entering upon certain lands now
claimed by the New Liverpool Company
turns out to affect but a small portion of
the lands which have heretofore been
used and occupied by the latter company
for mining and purifying salt. Hence, it
may be that some of the mines of the
company may fa^ll to the lot of the rival
salt companies or .the employes of the
company itself may make a strike.
At any rate, the eagerly awaited mes
sage from "Washington means a hot time
in the town of Salton for a few hours
after its receipt. It will take but a few
minutes to place the location monuments,
so many men are now on the ground, and
each has .been thoroughly drilled in his
particular work. Four men could put the
corner monuments'in less than five, min
utes after the message arrives and then
the claims are good for all time, so long
as the assessment work is done each year.
If the rival gangs of men get to fighting
the lives of some of them may be lost.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 30.â The time limit
on the Blsning of the saline land bill is
nearly up. Congress passed a bill ten
days agx> opening the salt lands on the
Colorado Desert to settlers and the rush
for the lands began a day or two after
the bill was passed. 'Since Its passage
by Congress nothing more has been heard
from the bill.

GLASGOW, Jan. 20. â In the framework
of the America's cup challenger, already
set up, are indications of some striking
departures from conventional designing.
The most noticeable of these is that the
bulk of the yacht is thrown extraordin
arily far forward. The timbers at pres
ent in position suggest the framework of
the old bluff-bowed type of yacht more
than the modern racing yacht. This will
be modified when the frames to carry for
ward the overhangs are In position. But
it is certain the greatest beam will be for
ward of the mast. Every precaution is
3till taken to prevent information about
the cup challenger getting abroad.

were drawn by lot. The first match
played was between Mrs. Haslett and C.

The former team won the first set by the'
close score of $â H. â¢ Their opponents
braced up and won the next two sets han
dily, 6 â 4, 6 â 1. This was the only match
of the day that required the full thr*c
sets to be played. One more match was
playod In the preliminary round by teams
composed of Mies R. Sherwood an-1
Gcorpe F. Whitney and Mrs. Kincald
and N. Hodgklnson. Mrs. Kincald played
a strong, aggressive game and was ably
assisted by her hard-hitting partner, but
they were slightly outclassed by tho
champion and his fair partner, who won
in straight sets, the score being &^4, 9â7,
In the first round Miss McCartney and
Smith proved too strong for their oppo
nents. Miss II Sherwood and Lucius Al

6â3. The next match, between Miss
Emma Hunter and R. â¢ N. Whitney and
Miss R. Sherwood and George Whitney,
was the match of the day and brought
forth much applause from the spectators.
The former team was considered the
strongest In the tournament, but after
two close and hotly contested sets Miss
Sherwood and her partner came out win
ners. The last game of this match was
particularly close and exciting, the score
going from deuce to vantage and back to
deuce many times before the champion

contest. Miss R. Sherwood played A re-

MIXED DOUBLES ON
CALIFORNIA COURTS
FROM the time the curtain arose |
until it Cell first choices in the j
betting stalked through their j
parts at Tanforan Park yester- '
day fn very catching style. The \
bookies chalked up liberal quotations i
against each of the six favorites, the tal- j
ent accepted the price and all six prom- j
enadea past the judges in front of their |
fields. It was an exceedingly unprofitable j
day for the ring, and some retirements j
from, among its ranks are looked for to- j
day.
To start off with, the Burns & Watfr
house entry. Gold Or. was sent to the
pott a H to 10 favorite for the introductory
eeven furlong run. -There was consider
able bumping and jostling at the start,
and with Gonfalon away in the lead by ;
three or four length* it looked dubious"' :
for the choice. At the paddock Henry j
crew his whip on Gonfalon, which was 1
not relished, for he faltered. Jenkins then |
hustled the favorite along and got the
verdict by a neck. Specific ran lust, te- :

Henry had the leg up, and at odds of 3 to
X the brown bone won under restraint
from Ftart to finish. Showing consider
able improvement, Ov.ensboro finished
two lengths before Hdgardo for the place.
Topmast sulked all the way.
Then came the clever win of Lothian in
tho steeplechase, over two miles. With
141 pounds and Sutherland in the saddle,
"Boots" Durnfll'.-i jumper ruled favorite
8t odds of 7 to 10. Fortunately for the
hackers of the first choice. Texarkana
chopped one of his fore tendons two-jumps
before the last, enabling Lothian to. get
up and score by a couple of lengths. But
for this accident the result might have
bffn different. Auriffera ranthird.

By far the rosiest win of the day was
that of Moonbright. in the six furlong

chance, the filly made nearly all the run

The work of Rival's Answer wass sen
sational. Her first course with Game
Boy, the wonder of two weeks ago, was
her hardest trial. Mosquito was put out
by a score of 18-0; lone. 8-0, and Free
Banner, 10-0. The deciding course was be
tween Rival's Answer and Black Flush.
Both dogs were tired and Rival's Answer
had to combat superior experience, but
nevertheless won out, score. 30-8.
The Iceman proved, a star sapling. In
the first round Prompto wan frozen by a
score of 13-0, and In the second round An
dromeda went to her kennels with chills
that chattered, a 48-3 score. Then Hap
hazard suffered from the cold wave.

and who gives promise of being a great
dog. was withdrawn before meeting Ice
man in the fourth round. This .left Ice
man and his sister. For Liberty, to divide
the money. . .
There were few upsets for the talent
yesterday, the favorites gathering in the
coin. Following are the results:
It was "For Freedom" day in every
sense of the word, for the get of that In
comparable courser carried off the hon
ors in both stakes. Rival's Answer, a
For Freedom puppy from the kennels of
J. H. Rosseter, won the puppy stake In
splendid style, while first money in the
sapling. stake was divided by Iceman and
For Liberty, both For Freedom stock,
from the kennels of Sterl & Knowles.
Among the last six dogs in each stake
were three of For Freedom's get. an un
precedented honor for a coursing sire.
"The best sapling and puppy, stakes
ever run In America," was Judge Grace's
verdict at the close of the coursing con
tests at Union Park yesterday afternoon.
Two stakes, the sapling, twenty-three
entries, and the puppy, forty-eight
entries, were run without a hitch, but one
undecided and one unsighted course being
marked on the programme. The young
sters behaved like veterans and their
work was warmly applauded.

D. Danziger, O. C, and D. J. Byrnes,
The officials were: J. B. Smith, referee;
Milton Hayes and W. M. Cartwrlght,
judges: F. R. Butz, timer, and R. Mc-
Glbbon. announcer.
THE curtain was raised last night
at the Olympic Club on the ama
teur boxing tournament for the
championship of the Pacific Const.
Feather-weights and light-weights
occupied the fistic stageâ sixteen of the
former and eight of^the latter.
During the early part of the evening
the tournament dragged, but after the
feather-weight boxers had been allowed
their say and the light-weights had come
within the calcium, some ginger and spice
was scattered on the glove feast. About
the time the thirsty were leaving their
seats for liquid refreshment W. L. Bevert
of the West Oakland Club and D. A. Car
roll, one of the Olympic . prize- boxers,
stepped into the ring for a tilt at heads.
Carroll, to the surprise of all, was carried
to his corner in less than a minute df
fighting. This was the formal introduc
tion of knockouts. James Britt treated
C. Garcia to a -similar dose of medicine
at the wind-up of the programme, and
the crowd, which comfortably filled the
gymnasium, was put in better spirits.
Britt and Bevert will make whirlwinds
and cyclones if they come together, as
they are very like to do, before tho wind
up of the light-weight class.
proved a tragedy to himself. In the third
round .Referee Smith gave the fight to
Leonard.
James Howard and . Frank . McDonald,
both unattached, Â¦were next inside tho
ropes. McDonald earn?d tho decision be
fore the end of the third round, but How
ard's strong <flnlsh Inlluenced the judges
to call for another. Howard won out.
Lewis Long of the Keliance Athletic
Club then mrt J. ShaokeUon. unattached.
Long was given the decision.
The first lightweight fight was the event
of the evening. D. A. Carroll. Olympic
Club favorite, fell to the boards in just
forty-rive seconds of -fighting, when XV.
L. Bevert Jr. of the West Oakland Ath
letic Club got fit him. Bovert is an active,
strong, clever fighter and will give the
best of the liehtweights a good run.
J. A. Rock of the Olympic Club received
the decision over J. Flynn of the. West
Oakland Club.
J. A. Raggert, unattached, and D. Mur
phy of the Olympic Club tried the stray
ing cyclone act. Murphy went down and
out Just before the first round ended.
James Brltt. Olympic Club, and C. Gar
cia of tho Pacific Athletic Club were the
last of the lightweights on last night's
bill. Britt was there with both hands.
In less than i round Garcia turned nib
toes toward the skylight and whacked his
head on the boards under the ropes. A
left and right did the trickâ rather a stiff
left and right at that.
The tournament will be continued this
evening:
FOR FREEDOM PUPPIES RUN IN RECORD
FORM IN THE TWO STAKES AT UNION PARK
unattached, set the fistic whirl a-goliiK.
For three rounds they fought so evenly
that ' the Judges tasked for another
spell of lighting. The fourth round,
which, under the amateur rules. Is lopped
oft a minute, haÂ«J pretty much of the color
of Danzlger. So the judges thought, and
the> Olympic Club man was pronounced
the winner.
After the curtain-raiser, J. Moran of tho
Pacific Athletic Club and D. J: Byrnes,
unattached, furnished three acts of com
edy. Byrnes suffered from atage fright
at first and later from many head knocks.
Moran was an easy winner.
The third contest was between James
Donohue and T. A. RIordan. both Unat
tached. Donohue started out; as If ha
thought his , first name was Tern*, but
somewhere In the second or third round
he proved untrue oven to his thoughts.
RIordan: was proclaimed the winner after
an extra round was called for.
Then cam o F. H. Simpson of the West
Oakland Athletic Club and J.- Lundle, un
attached.;, Simpson wag strong at the out
set; but finished on the floor at the end of
the third round. Lundie scored the vic
tory. *
â¢William Kreling of the San Franclso
Athletic Club and H. \Wasa. unattached,
were next on tho programme. An extr.i
round was necessary before the judgcj
llxed upon Kreling as the winner. .
The most grotesque bout of the even
lng,was between W. J. Leonard. Olympic
Club, and W. Troy of nowhere. Troy
fancied he was a fistic comedian, but he

unanimously adopted:
" Whereas, Experience has demonstrated at
this port. as. well as at other seaports in the

tion of superior authority constantly arise, thus
Tetardlng the docking of vessels and causing
much annoyance and embarrassment to the
masters and owners thereof, unnecessary delay
to consignees and ' great discomfort to pas
sengers; and . . ,\
Whereas. The Federal Government maintains
a quarantine service at the port of San Fran
cisco and claims that its authority in the prem
ises is paramount to thnt of the Stateâ In which
contention it has been upheld by: the Federal
and State courts; therefore, be It
Resolved. That the passage of Assembly bill
No. 294 wlll^not be productive of any. benefit
to the State of California or the port of San
Francisco, but will prove a great detriment to
the commercial and shipping Interests of said
port and add to the burdens thereofâ already
claimed to be excessive; and belt further
Resolved. That > the Senators and Assembly
men from the city and; county, of San Fran
cisco be and they are hereby; requeated to use
their best endeavors to prevent said bill from

Buencamino and Other Filipinos Axe
â¢ Considering- the Organization
of an Evangelical
Â» Church. -
MANILA, Jan. SO.â Dr. Krugrer. the Ger
man Consul General here, has cabled to
the Berlin Government asking that the
Berlin Embassador at Washington be in
structed to diplomatically urge the pas
sage of the Spooner bill.
Two mining corporations organized in
Germany are anxious to begin operations
in the Philippines, but cannot do 00 un
til the status of mining: claims is estab
lished by a permanent government.
Similar action will probably be taken by
the British Consul.
Buencamino and some of the other
Filipino leaders ln Mapila have about de
cided to become Protestants and are Con
sidering, the . organization of an Evangeli
cal church. In an interview to-day Buen
camino said that he had learned that the
Pope had decided to. restore the friars
to their former position In the Philip
pines. Buencamino added that the Fili
pinos could not submit to that and the
effect would be that they .will shortly
leave the Catholic. church ln great num
bers. No public meeting' has been held,
but- the leaders- of -the movement will
meet .privately to-night to discuss the
question with Rev. James B. Rodgera, a
missionary of the Presbyterian board,
who advises the * establishment of an
Evangelical church.
The principals of thÂ© project are Buen
camino, Dr. Rosarlo, Tavare and Flores.
All of these men are members of the
executive committee of the Federal party.
But Chief Justice Arello and General
Torres, the remaining members of that
committee, adhere strictly to the Catholic
church and have declared thÂ© movement
toward Presbyterianism does not emanate
from the party organization.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â Neither the
State Department nor the German Em
bassy so far has received any communica
tion from the German Government urg
ing the enactment of the Spooner Philip
pine resolution, as Indicated in the last
Manila advices. But the Government
here is fully acquainted .with the earnest
desire of foreign capitalists, not only Ger
man, but British, to begin immediately
the Investment of large sums of money in
the development of the Philippines' as
soon as that can be done safely. The
Philippine Commission, through Judge
Taft, has reported that its inability to
confer any sort of a permanent franchise
has paralyzed the development of the
archipelago. The reported pressure from
German financial interests was fully ex
pected.

Before comir.g to Illinois William Henry
Campbell learned the whereabout* of Dr.
Wright and the child, and says he went
to the expense of sending by telegraph a
lengthy warrant for the arrest of Dr.
W right at Clinton, but that the Sheriff
Of De Witt County refused to serve the
Â¦warrant because it did not bear the offi
cial seal of the court of California. A
writ of habeas corpus was left here late

"Dr. W right may have heard of its being
Issued here and may have left the State

\VlllI3m Henry Campbell, the father of
the little heiress, was appointed guardian
of the child after taking the case through
the courts of California. In thÂ© mean
time Dr. Wright and his aged wife had
sold their property ln California and fled
from the State in order that they might
retain the custody of the little one. Wil
liam Henry Campbell, the father, arrived
ln Springfield to-day and filed papers ln
the Circuit Court asking for a writ of
habeas corpus. In the papers it is set
up that William Henry Campbell Is the
father of Fannie Marie Campbell, ar.d
that he Is also her legally appointed
g-uardian; that the child's mother died
when the girl was two yeafs old, after
which she lived with her maternal grand
parents, and that on December 4, 1900, the
father applied to the Superior Court of
California for letters of guardianship. It
is also alleged that Dr. Wright, in whose
custody the child was at the time, re
sisted the issuance of such letters and
secured a continuance for two weeks.
and that two days before the time set

took ihe child from the Jurisdiction of the

LAWYER LOWENTHAL RAISES A LUMP ON HEAD
OF ATTORNEY SHADBURNE WITH A HICK0RY CANE
IN RETURN FOR A STINGING SLAP ON THE FACE
A BLUE and shining lump on the
left temple of Attorney George
D. Shadburne Is living evidence
of the fact that there was trou
ble in Judge Sloss* department
of the Superior Court yesterday morning,
A marred spot on the varnish of Lawyer
H. H. I>owenthars cane is another link
in the chain of evidence to establish the
fact that a combat occurred, while the
record of the court, containing the Judge's
words of reprimand and warning, will
make denials of the fact subjects for
laughter.
The row, fast and dangerous, ln which
Shadburne and Lowenthal were the prin
cipals, occurred in Judge Sloss' court
shortly before the noon adjournment.
That Shadburne did n.ot suffer a fractured
skull was due alone to Lowenthal's In
firmities and. though his blow was sure.
Its weicht was but enough t6 raise a
"hen's egg" on the skull of his adversary.
Lowenthal's only injury was to his dig
city. Shadburne raked a package of pa
pers across his face, which, owing to the
fact that he Is a victim of locomotor
ataxia. throw him off his balance. His
cane landing on Shadburne's skull followed
in an instant. The clerk and bailiff rushed
to separate the contestants, and a minute
later Shadburne was pressing his hand
kerchief to his bruise, while Lowenthal
continued the examination of a witness
on the stand.
The action by which E. H. Ashton seeks
to recover Judgment against Henry Var
ney and other? on n promissory noie was
on hearing. The plaintiff contends that
the defendant owes him several hundred
dollars, while the-defendant claims that
h<Â» has wiped out his indebtedness to Ash
ton by deeding him several pieces of prop
erty. Shadburne, who represents the de
fendant, had called upon Lowenthal to
produce certain deeds, which he believed
would establish the truth of his conten
tion.
When the case was called for hearing
Shadburne called for the deeds. Lowen
thal presented three instruments of con
veyance, but Shadburne was not satisfied.
"The deed I want is that conveying
property from my client to yours," he
said, "and although you promised to bring
it to court you have failed to keep your
word."
"I have not deceived you, answered
Lowenthal. "I told you I would bring
you all the deeds I had, and I have done
so."
"You know you are not telling the
truth," angrily responded Shadburne.
"You said you would bring me the deed
and you have failed to keep your prom
ise."
" "If you say I promised to bring you any
certain deed you are telling a falsehood,"
arswered Lowenthal.
Shadburne did not answer, but taking a
roll of papers he raked them across
Lowenthal's face. Lowenthal fell back
against the desk, grasped hi? cane and,
as Shadburne prepared to follow up his
advantage, brought the heavy hickory
down on his adversary's skull.
Before Shadburne could regain control
of his muscles to advance to the attack
Clerk Morris and Bailiff McKenna had
stepped between.
Attorney Shadburne's son was in court
ana without waiting for instructions from
his father rushed home to tell his mother
Counsel in Promissory Note Case Engage in a Row Over a Miss
ing Deed and It Takes the United Efforts of the Officers of
the Court to Restrain the Wife and Son of the Vanquished

DEMOCRATS PLAN
JOINT CONFERENCE
It also develops that no on* wants an
extra session, and that one will be avoid
ed if there is any possible way of doing
fo. It is even said that the Spooner bill
will be passed ln order to avoid such ses
sion after the 4th of March. Republican
leaders say that they believe an extra
pession can be avoided. They say also
that the Democrats must decide whether
they will take the responsibility of de
feating the subsidy bill, and If It Is
demonstrated that they are willing to
take that responsibility then other neces
sary legislation will be pressed rapidly
to avoid an extra session.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. SO.â A conference
of Democrats and their associates of the
Populist and Silver Republican faith will
be held to-morrow as a result of the
declaration yesterday by Fry* that he in
tended to push the consideration of the
Bhip Eubsldy bill to the exclusion of all
other business except by vote of the Sen
ate. This conference will determine the
fate of the bill. If the opponents of the
measure decide lo continue a stiff fight
and debate the measure at great length, it
will meet defeat at this Eepslon. with the
short time remaining to pass the appro
priation bills. The conference also will
take into consideration the question
whether the minority will desire to take
the responsibility of defeating a party
measure of the majority. Some of the op
ponents of the bill on the Democratic side
feel that if the Republicans are deter
mined to pas* the bill the minority should
not go further than to state their objec
tions fully and vote rigaln?t it and to let
the Republicans take the responsibility
which is thelrB.

School Land Law Causes
Much Uneasiness in
Texas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 30.â The discovery
that thÂ© State public free school land act
of 1SS3, which is still in force, reserves to
the State all of Its oils and minerals dis
covered on lands belonging to the school
fund sold on or after the date of the pas
sage of that law, created a stir among the
many oil prospectors who have leases on
oil lands in Bast Texas and other parts
of the State that formerly belonged to the
public school fund and were sold since
1883. An effort will be made to secure
thÂ© passage by the Legislature of a law
validating the titles to these lands and to
repeal the provisions which give this un
developed wealth to the State. An In
vestigation of the title of the tract of
land on which, the great Lucas gusher is
situated shows that it never belonged to
the school fund and that It Is a part of
an old Spanish grant which was patented
in 1835.
Another oil company, with a capital of
II. 000.000,' filed Its charter In the Secre
tary of State's office here to-day. It is
named the American Oil Company and its
principal office Is located in Beaumont.
its purpose Is to lease lands, prospect for
and construct and operate oil pipe lines
and reservoirs. The incorporators are

The corporation. In connection with
other large Independent companies that
have been organized to conduct oil
operations in the State, will oppose the ef
forts oC the Standard Oil Company to gain
a footing in the new oil fields. It was
learned to-day, however, that the oil well
in the Beaumont district was â¢'bought in"
yesterday and -Is the Standard Oil Com
pany's property. This new strike was
made near Taylors Bayou, eighteen- miles
south of the Lucas gusher, on land leased
by J. A. Paulhamu*. a representative of
the Standard Oil Company. The flow is
said to exceed 100 barrels per day and the
quality of the oil is of a much higher
grade than. the Lucas well. The oil was
struck at a depth of about 1100 feet.

HOW TO HELP THEM.
Life to the most favored is not
always full of sunshine, but to the
everag-e American girl or woman who
is obliged to work for her living, and,
perhaps to help others at home, life is
often a heavy drag in consequence of
illness.
Women who work, especially those
who are constantly on their feet, are
peculiarly liable to the development
of organic troubles, and should par-
ticularly heed the first manifestations,
6ueh as backache, pains in the lower
limbs and lower part of the stomach,
irregular and painful monthly periods,
faintness, weakness, loss of appetite

FASHION HINTS FROM PARIS.
The claim will be the more irritating to the Euro
pean powers by reason of the fact that it is amply sup
ported by the testimony of American, British and
Japanese spectators who watched the progress of the
allied armies. Indeed it would appear that before a
court of arbitration it would be easy for Ching to
prove that most of the "punitive expeditions" senc
out to teach the Chinese to behave themselves were
little more than forays for booty. The powers, in fact,
have looted China for ten times the amount that then,
citizens lost at the hands of the Boxers, and if a fair
balance were to be struck Europe would have to pay
damages to China instead of receiving damages from
her. j .
The "outrage" ii\ Ching's action lies not in the na
ture of his claim, but in the fact that he made it at
all. .If it were to be admitted for examination it could
be proven, but it cannot be admitted. The â¢ very -'pre'r
In presenting his claim Prince Ching is reported .to
have stated: "Chinese merchants and private citizens
assert that valuables have been looted amounting to
immense sums, and it would not be fair to fail, to take
these' largely into consideration when the question of
indemnities is discussed. Tientsin, Peking and all the
cities and towns between have been .absolutely
stripped, while priceless treasures belonging to pri
vate individuals have been, confiscated, irrespective of
all ideas of modern warfare."
r^ IVILIZATION will learn with a shudder that
( Prince Ching, after agreeing to the demands
of the powers that China shall pay indemnity
for injury done to Europeans and Americans residing
in China at the time of the Boxer outbreak, has now
p*ut forward the claim that the powers should pay in
demnity to China for injury done by their armies to
innocent Chinese. It is-good for Princo Ching that
Kaiser William is at this time too busy swapping
uniforms artd decorations with King Edward to give
heed to what Ching is doing, for otherwise there
would be emitted from the great war lord a roar that
would make a Chinese gong sound like the squeak
of a penny whistle.
ANOTHER CHINESE OUTRAGE.
CLEAN RACING.
THE remarkable meeting called by the Mayer
with the intention of getting backing for h : s
proposition to give the people of this city thirty
days' dissipation, with incidental pocket-picking, pro
duced a startling protest against his peculiar propo
sition.
There were present advocates of an open season,
but they did not venture to offer an3* apology for the
crimes caused by track gambling.
There were pleas for clean racing. That is-the only
kind of racing that decent men want, and it can be had
only by knocking loose the grip of the gamblers on
the tracks, which to them are simply the means of
illicit gains, won unfairly from the credulous people
who gamble against a sure thing. This same fight
has been made in the East and South, where racing
ceased to be a sport and an incentive to good horse
breeding, and degenerated to the base use of gam
blers. Genuine horsemen deplore such debasement
and are as ready as any members of the community
to aid in its extirpation. Such men even go to the
extent of declaring that if racing cannot be clean,
cannot be free from such use, it would better stop al
together, until the gamblers are compelled to divert
their schemes to other channels.
The Mayor's meeting was not what he expected.
The gamblers did not have it all their own way. It
memorialized the Legislature to permit racing and
bookmaking for thirty days in each county, reserv
ing to any county the right to prohibit both, and then
it adopted another memorial to the Legislature, em
ploying the language of the Mayor himself, in his
annual message, against public gambling and depict
irg and deploring its evils.
The report of the meeting says that the Mayor
joined in the laugh that went around when he was
quoted against himself. He may laugh, but there are
others who do not join in his merriment. They are
men in stripes in the penitentiary, women and chil
dren bearing the sorrow and suffering. of their dis
grace, and employers who have been robbed by em
ployes, corrupted and grown criminal by the seduc
tions of track gambling. There was no laugh from
honest tradesmen whose bills have been defaulted by
customers that wasted their money on the track, and
the good citizens who suffer in their material inter
ests through the evil repute brought upon the city
by just such a season of dissipation and pocket
picking as the Mayor advocates. * He is the last man
who should be merry when confronted by his own
high sounding denunciation of a crime that he now
favors.
What has changed him? Why docs he now favor
what he denounced last year? Is it becoming in the
chief officer of a city to openly advocate or secretly
favor pocket-picking? What is to become of the
reputation of San Francisco if the morals of the city
are to be left in such guardianship?
It should be a matter of the deepest congratulation
to the people of San Francisco that in an emergency
of such serious moment as a revival of the curse of
track gambling the clergymen of the city were as one
in an overwhelming advocacy of what was manifestly
a matter of public policyâ the defeat of gamblers and
thieves.
As a political gymnast who is able to be on all sides
of a thing at once his Honor the Mayor is winning
a most extraordinary reputation out of the efforts of
gamblers to have their trade revived at Ingleside.
But perhaps his Highness would prefer to consider
himself a political contortionist who can turn himself
cut.
A mysterious woman has been imposing of late
upon conductors of the Market Street Railway. If
she had only used her wiles upon the company we
mig-ht be willing to accept her as an agent of retri
butive justice.

LOGICâ W. H. L., Vallejo. Cal. The
Rtudy of logic is a part of the curriculum
of the modern universities and colleges.
It may be that the laws regulating the sale of liquor
in Kansas are not rightly enforced. It may be that
great evils result from the negligence of the officials.
It .may be that Mrs. Natioir.is working in a good
cause and that her zeal is one born of a high motivi.
Nevertheless, she has reached the danger point in her
crusade, and it is time to stop. The men and women
who are most earnest in the cause of temperance
would do well to calm the Kansas crusader. She has
gone far enough for notoriety, and. too far for safety.
The reports of the affray told us that during the
time it was raging most fiercely there arose from the
mob gathered around the cry, "Kill her! Kill her!"
Of cqurse the cry was one of excitement merely. It
did not mean anything of murderous vindictiveness,
but it nevertheless has an ominous sound. Of late,
years the American people in many States, and some
of them among the best ordered in the Union, have
shown a mad tendency to commit the most out
rageous offenses under sudden impulses , of violence.
It is clear from these experiences that one ofthc dan
gers against which we must guard most carefully is
that of a hysterical mob. When in the midst of a
street affray the cry goes up to kill, it is time to call
a halt. .
, It happens, however, there is a serious side to the
affair. Lawlessness. begets- lawlessness, and violence
is sooner or later confronted Ky violence. The Ameri
can man, even if he be a saloon-keeper, will "not fight
back against a woman, even if she be a window
Smasher, but there are women who are quite wiHing
to take the part of the saloon-keepers and fight back.
Already Mrs. Nation has had a touch of their quality.
It was but a short time ago that in assailing a saloon
she was herself assailed by a woman and horse
whipped. Men stood around and watched the women
fight it out. That was not funny.
All that is humorous enough for a comic opera, and
in our free and easy fondness for fun we are apt to
treat the thing as a joke and to urge on the frolic with
the cry, "Go it, Carrie!" .
The situation has its humorous and its serious side.
What can be more funny at the dawn of this twentieth
century' than the uprising of respectable men and
women in an American State to go about breaking
saloon windows and singing: Â» - '
Alexander's body is a-burning In the fire,
Alexander's bedy is a-burning In the fire,
Alexander's body is a-burnlng: in the flre.
As we go marching on. *
Mrs. Carrie Nation is destroying rum saloons,
Mrs. Carrie Nation Is destroying rum saloons,
Mrs. Carrie Nation is destroying- rum saloons.
As we go marching on.
The crusade of Mrs. Nation has been something
extraordinary even in Kansas. Having become en
raged against saloons t . W ehita she proceeded to
smash them with brickbat*, stones, clubs,, axes and
any other weapon that came handy. She was put
iirto jail, but she made the jail a glorified seat of
martyrdom. No sooner was she free than she re
sumed her war, carrying it at last to the capital of
the State, where, followed by a crowd of all sorts of
people, she assailed the Governor, the Attorney Gen
eral, the Sheriff and nearly every other official she
could get at. In the course of her progress she has
formed a considerable following of zealous support
ers and is now a woman of no mean power in the
land. She has been offered a gold medal by the Kan
sas Temperance Union, and in Boston the New Eng
land Prohibitionists have been commending .her
course and exalting her to the highest Massachusetts
honors.
WHAT does it profit Kansas to have Mrs. Lease
retire from politics and "Mrs. Carrie Nation
take the warpath? ;That- is a question of.in
terest to more people than the Kansans. Mrs. Lease
was an agitator along lawful lines. ; Mrs. Nation is a
smasher of saloons along the lines of violence and
lawlessness. There is the change from fanaticism to
hysterics, from demagogy to anarchy. We could well
afford to welcome â¢ Mrs. " Lease^in any part of the
country. Even those who did not agree with her were
generally willing to listen to her.. With Mrs. Nation
it is different. 'There are few communities that would
be glad to have her for 'a week's visit. The popular
sentiment is that if Kansas likes her Kansas should
keep her.

: Editor Call: I have read with great In
terest your editorial In to-day's Issue, en
titled -"Bishop Potter's View." I am
heartily In agreement with you in believ
ing that. Western injustice toward China
is the cause of much of the recent trouble
In that country, and that honorable men
everywhere should unite In demanding
that this Injustice should cease. It Is
not the whole cause of it. "'With a differ
ent ruler, and with better advl3ers than
the Jklanchus, there would probably have
been a very diffrrent story. No j such
scenes would have been witnessed as took
place In the Governor's Yamen in Shansi.
The Governor himself would not have or
dered the butchery In his own official resi
dence of forty-five helpless an! 'nnocen:
men, wonfen and children and claimed
thereafter, as he did in his report to the
Kmpress Dowager, a reward of 400 taels
apiece for the murders.
Though I agree with much In the article
referred to, I regret that it is weakened
by some inaccuracy and an apparent de
sire to put the blame where it does not
belong-^-on the shoulders of missionaries.
You say that ."the final cause of â¢ causes
that joined In producing the trouble" wa3
what you call "the forgery interpolated
ir the treaty of 1S6J by a Christian mis
sionary.": Now, sir, in referring to a_sub
ject in which many of the best men and
women in this country are profoundly in
terested a great newspaper ought to be
accurate. 'â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦....' ...
I'or?ery is not the' proper name for the
transaction referred to. After the
France-Chinese treaty of I860 wad drawn
ujÂ«. but before it was signed, a. F.ench
priest, acting as interpreter for tho
French Minister, inserted in the Ch'neso
copy of the treaty the clause permitting
French missionaries to reside and own
property in the Interior and the Chinese
Ministers signed the treaty with that
clause before them and without a word of
protest. I do not attempt to justify the
Frenchman for vjhat he did, but the Chi
nese knew of it \nd annexed their sig
natures knowing lV that the clause was
there. This Is a very different thing from
your general statement, which would lead
a reader unacquainted with the facts to
suppose that it was a case ; of -forgery
after the treaty, was signed. After some
time all the other treaty powers claimed
the same privileges under the favored na
tion clause.
But, however you describe the act, it is
not easy to see how it could be the final
cause of causes that joined 411 producing
the trouble. There were wars with China
and riots in China before, that treaty was
ever thought ofâ wars and riots with
which Christian missions had no'more to
do than the precession of the equinoxes.
Coming to recent events, what connection
had Germany's taking of Kiaochau, Rus
sia's of Port Arthur. England's of Wei
haiwei and France's of Kwangchau
Bay with the so-called forgery? What
connection had the epening of mines, the
building of railways, the industrial ex
ploitation of the country resulting from
the Japanese war to do with it? How is
the Chinese reform movement, the head
(The Call, while inviting communications on
current topics, docs not hold itself respon
â¢ slble .for the^vlewa of the writers.)
of which was the Emperor himself, and
to which the Empres3 Dowager and her
party were so bitterly opposed, related to
It? And yet almost every foreign resident
of China acquainted with affairs knows
that these were the chief causes leading
to the outbreak..
Let us be fair to the" ' missionaries of all
tho churches and especially to those of
our own country. I have lived many years
In China and I do not hesitate to say
that on the whole they are far and away
the best representatives of American
thought and life that China .knows. They
are the best friends that China has.
They are the chief benefactors of her
people. As one of trie oldest foreign resi
dents In the empire has recently said,
"The poor are taught In their schools, the
sick are healed in their hospitals and the
helpless are helped by' them ! In many
ways." They have done more for
the education of the Chinese In modern
things, in science and the knowledge nec
essary in our own days than the central
Government and all the provincial gov
ernments in China put together. They
have translated nearly all the modern
books she has, have built and ministered In
nearly all the -hospitals and are the heads
of nearly all her colleges, even those un
der go\-ernmental control. Multitudes of
the best men In China know these things
and acknowledge them. I knew personal
ly many who do. I have been In chargo
of the largest Christian college In China
for several years and have received many
handsome subscriptions from Chinese
gentlemen for the college work. Four
years ago I built a large dormitory, every
dollar of the cost of which was paid by
Chinese officials, merchants and literati.
The college grounds and the main build-
Ing thereon were the gift of several Chi
nese, and the leading men in the city,
the provincial capital of Fokien, have
been its steady friends.
It may be interesting to know that Wu
Ting Fang, or, to give him his Cantonese
name, Ng Choi, owes his education to a
Christian school In Hongkong. Fcr some
years he was a , scholar at St. Paul's
School, where everything was done for
him. free of charge, except clothe him.
He was baptized and wa* an earnest pro
fessor of Christianity, going out frequent
ly with his teachers to preach and enlarg
ing with great force on the teachings of
the latter's sermons. He has changed
his faith since then, but it is no exaggera
tion to say that China owes the ablest
Foreign Minister she has to that Chris
tian college in Hongkong.
Do not accuse me of boasting when I
say that but for the work of the Christian
churches in China the Chinese people
everywhere would have a sorry opinion of
foreigners to-day. Our countrymen in
the missions in the empire are among the
best representatives we have there, and
for our own sake, as well as that of the
Chinese, we ought to support them in
their work and that, too. whether we be
lieve in their religious propaganda or not.
We ought to sustain them as educators,
physicians, representatives of the best
spirit of the West.
This is a long letter to inflict on you and
I shall be all the more obliged on that
account if you publish it. I write it
from a real sense of Justice to a body of
men, of the great majority of whom
Americans have good reason to be proud

It is interesting to compare the first of
ficial utterances of Victor Emmanuel III
with those of Edward VII. for the com
parison sheds a certain illumination on
the character of each and on the condi
tion of the countries over which they
have assumed sway. Each of these mon
archs in his proclamation sounded what
was admittedly a sincere note of filial
grief. Victor referring to "this good and
virtuous King." Edward to "my beloved
mother, the Queen." The spirit of tho
Italian, however, was that of a sovereign
looking forward to nia own reisn and in
voking the great memories of his housi
to win the loyalty of his subjects, whllo
the spirit of the Englishman Is rather
that of a sovereign who recognizes in tha
shadow of a personal loss a mandate to
maintain the standards and traditions
which death has Intrusted to his guard

UTTERANCE
IN VARIETY
The case is a simple one. The powers have sent to
China certain high oncers of state charged with the
duty of compelling China under threat of partition to
pay an indemnity whose, amount is to be fixed by the
powers, and in addition thereto to chop' off the head?
of certain men by way of proving how much" more
humane Christianity is then barbarism. Instead of
accepting.the ncgotiationson those simple terms and
doing proper kow-tow to the solemn representatives
of imperial majesties, Prince Ching avts as if he
deemed the "whole shooting match" to be nothing
more than a common court of arbitration called to
gether for the purpose of doing justice. If that be not
an outrage, what is it?
sentation of it is something in. the character of a con
tempt of court. Does Prince Ching supposelthat the
European diplomats-have gone to China for -the pur
pose of assessing damagesjagaihst the sovereigns who
pay them? Does he deem that with impunity he can
"monkey" with the august grand masters of -imperial
diplomacy?
No more telling disproof of the Inter Ocean's
charge can be made than by these public records of
the transactions of his office.
So, instead of hoarding the money of the people,
within a few months he set free, by anticipatory pay
ments of interest and by reduction of principal on the
national debt, the large sum of $54,535,413 86.
As to the hoarding of money, the Secretary says:
"As the resources of the treasury became greater
than its immediate needs, a series of measures were
adopted for restoring the surplus to the uses of busi
ness. After September 18, 1899, interest due October
1 was paid in advance of maturity to the amount of
$3,208,027. From October 10 in like manner antici
pation was made of $9.16,038 61 due November 1, ajid.
of $3,398,504 50 due January 1. An offer made on
October 10 to prepay all interest accruing to July 1,
1900, at a rebate of two-tenths of one per cent i>er
month, was accepted to the amount of $2,229,191 35.
On November 15 a proposal was made to purchase
$25,000,000 of the 4 and 5 per cent bonds due in 1904
and 1007 at a fixed price. This" was responded to by
offers of $19,300,050 of principal, upon which the pre
mium was $2,373,502 40. Notice was given May 18,
1900, for the pavment of $25,364,500 outstanding 2
per cent bonds, redeemable at option of the Govern
ment, and by November 1 all of them but $2,225,000
were retired."
In his last report he says: "We shall build, even in
this year of great activity in our shipyards, less than
one-tenth the shipping for foreign trade to be built
by our principal competitor. We do not carry 3 per
cent of the world's sea borne traffic. A bill for the
promotion of American commerce and for the cre
ation of an American merchant marine in foreign
trade which shall be worthy of the nation now awaits
the action of both branches of Congress. It con
forms in general outline to recommendations upon
the subject in the reports for 1898 and 1899. .Early
consideration of the measure is recommended."
In his last report these recommendations continue.
He asks that ihe important treasury office of weights
and measures be put upon a proper basis, ranking
with the bureaus maintained by all the leading
tions. This he regards as necessary to preserve the
correct standards, which the Government requires in
the collection of duties and excises, and to the gen
eral business public, every transaction being based
upon a standard weight or measure. He points out
that the manufacturers of standard weights and meas
ures will be greatly served by the operations of such
a bureau. Germany has trebled her export of such
standard appliances in the last ten years, due en
tirely tq the accuracy secured by the official bureau.
England, admonished by this, has established a simi
lar bureau. In his report for 1899 he sard: "Our
national greatness cannot be fully rounded cut while
we are so dependent as at present upon foreign ship
ping for our intercourse with the rest of mankind.
At 'this time political and commercial considerations
demand of us a larger measure of strength and inde
pendence on the seas than ever in our history, yet
never before have wo been relatively so weak in trans
oceanic navigation."
No prouder legend can be written above the record
of a public financier. He has wrought -without ceas
ir.g to have the Republican party redeem its pledges
to the business interests of the country, and we are
not aware of the least departure made by him from the
policy which has twice carried the nation for the party
of financial reform. As for policies, he' has recom
mended and personally urged the most important
financial policies that have engaged the attention of
the. Government since the Civil War. *
On the history of his administration of our finances
might well be written, "He found his country a
debtor and transformed her into a creditor.".
He has faithfully and with rare intelligence sup
ported financial reform by legislation, and his admin
istration of the treasury has been so successful that
he has the honor of being the first Secretary who has
seen Government 2 per cents at a premium and the
country occupy the easy position of a creditor nation.
We think it is a statement that has no foundation.
When did the Republican National Committee com
pare views on that subject and find itself unanimous
for such a change? The reason given is as far from
the truth as is the reputed sentiment of the commit
tee. Mr. Gage is not hoarding money in the treas
ury, and has no power to hoard it. He has no author
ity that is not derived from the law, and wherein the
law needlessly congests money in the treasury he has
recommended its amendment.
A WASHINGTON dispatch to the Chicago
Inter Ocean says: "The Republican National
Committee would vote, almost unanimously, to
get rid of Gage and bave a Republican Secretary of
the Treasury in his place broadminded enough to map
out policies rather than be simply a banker trying to
hoard the people's money and keep it out of circula
tion that would relieve them of unnecessary taxation."

TO ARRIVE,
A canvasser for a Chicago house known
} )y the name of C. J. Mackie Is very much
in demand on the front.' He made the
rounds last month and represented him
Â«=elf as the agent oi the Dundee Rubber
Corporation of Chicago. He sold rubber
mackintoshes and overcoats at prices
varying from $5 SO to $10. On each order
h* got a deposit, the balance to be "cash
on delivery *' Dr. Frank Robinson is out
$2 50. Dr. Starr a similar sum, Dr. Putnam
put up *5 and Henry Peterson fj. There
are a dozen other victims, but ail of them
received a circular yesterday stating that
Mr Mackle when last heard from was in
Kanta Cruz and heading for -Los Angeles.
None of the money collected had been for
warded to the corporation, and as . Mr.
Mackle was away' behind in his accounts
the firm refused to fill the orders unless
the money for the goods was forwarded.
AM the doctors hold . a receipt signed
"Dundee Rubber Corporation, per C. J.
Mackle agent," and the concern admits
that Mackie as such had a right to take"
orders. Relying upon their receipts the

An opinion was handed down yesterday
by United States District Judge de Ha
ven in the suits of the owners, master and
crew of the steam schooner Farallone
against the "steamer Alice Blanchard to
recover salvage for services rendered the
steamer Blanchard on November 17, 189o.
The Alice Blanchard, with passengers and
freight, was found in distress fourteen
miles north of -Port Orford and four or
five miles off shore.
In his decision Judge de Haven said that
in the light of the general rule declared
in the authorities quoted the court would
not en the facts shown in the present case
be justified in holding that the libelants
are entitled to' a very large award. The
service upon which the claim for salvage
compensation is based was rendered with
little if any, risk, continued the court, to
the salvors or to the vessel employed by
them in such service. In the opinion of
the court the testimony did not show that
the Alice BJanchard was at any time in
serious danger or that it could not have
made Port Orford in safety without as
judgment was given the libelants for
$1000 with interestâ three-fourths to the
owners and one-fourtrr to the master and
crew.
Otniers of the Alice Blanchard Must
Pay That Sum to the
Farallone.
ONE of the busiest wharves on the
front at the present time is Mis
sion Xo. 2. Three steamers are
being fitted out there and on each
a gang of men Is working night
and day. Right up against the bulkhead
Is the new steamer Acme. She Is being
completed for the coast trade, and Beadle
Bros, say she will be the finest vessel of
her kind afloat.
A little ahead of the Acme Is the new
steel tug Leslie Baldwin. She. is srteel
throughout and her machinery is oT the
latest modern type. She is for the firm
of Alexander & Baldwin, and goes from
here to Kahului, H. I., where she will
serve as a tender and towboat for-4he
company's fleet. .The new tug is a smart
looking craft and as good as money and
brains can make her. v \
The Chico Is lying at the most easterly
end of the wharf. She was formerly the
old Alice Blanchard and has had a varied
career. Once she was a smart little
coaster and made money for her owners.
Then she was remodeled. Placed on the
ways she was cut in two and fifty feet
added to h^r amidshlp. Since the alter
ation she has not been a success. Her
venture into the Mexican trade was a
failure and on the run to Eureka she was
not a success. Now she is being over
hauled after six months of retirement and
got ready for the Coos Bay trade. Under
the name of Chico the boat may become
a money-maker, but as the Alice Blanch
ard she never made a fortune for her
owners. â¢ ! .:.: --;-^

It was rough sport then, as now, as
many passages in the writers of the time
show: but these generally refer to It a3
played by menâ shepherds, plowmen and
others-^rather than boys. James I pro
hibited it at court as "meeter for laming
than making able the users thereof." It
had been forbidden by an edict of Ed
ward HI, almost three centuries earlier,
in 1349. but only because it was thought
to interfere with the popular interest In
archery.
Other games of ball were in vogue; like
tennis, to 1 which and its technicalities â
"set," "racket," etcâ there are many ref
erences in the plays; and bandy-ball,
which was like hockey, or a rude form of
golf, according to some authorities. Juliet,
when impatiently waiting for the return
of the nurse with a message from, Romeo,
says:
Had she affections, and warm, youthful blood.
She'd be as swift In motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her ta my sweet love.
And his to me.
Tire modern verb "bandy" had Its origin
in this old game; Just as "muss" comes
from a sport which was merely a scram
ble for small coins or other things throwa
down to be got by those who could seize
them first. In "Antony and Cleopatra"
the hero says: &&0S
Authority melts from me; of late, when I
Â¦ cried, "ho 1 .""
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start
forth.
And cry. "Your will?"
Not to dwell upon the scores of other
harmless boyish sport3 mentioned by
Shakespeare, 1 may refer to one or two
examples of a different kind, marked by
brutality or cruelty. -Falstaff. after the
cudgeling he got through the strategy of
the merry wives, says: "Since I plucked
geese, played truant and whipped top, I
knew not what 'twas to be beaten till
XXVII.
It is evident that Shakespeare was fa
miliar with schoolgirl work and ways ; but
the education of his own daughters was
apparently very limited. Neither of them
could write, and this was true of the
great majority of women of the middle
class at that time. In the case of Shakes
peare's daughters it did not interfere with
their getting husbands who were better
educated. Susannah married Dr. John
Hall, who was a physician of considerable
eminence in his profession and a good
Latin 'scholar withal. His manuscript
Latin medical case book was translated
into English and published in 1657. \ When
James Cooke, a surgeon, was Invited to
New Place to examine the books which
the doctor had left behind him, Mrs. Hall
told him that the manuscript was the
work of "one that professed physic with"
her husband. COoke, who was acquainted
with Dr. Hall's handwriting, told her that
the manuscript was his, but she denied it.
It Is clear that she did not know her hus
band's writing, though It is said to have
been "of an uniform and somewhat pe
culiar description, not readily to be mis
taken for any of the ordinary styles of
writing then in use." Yet, according to
the inscription on her gravestone, she was
a woman of more than average "wit" or
intellect:
Witty above her sexe. but that's not all.
Wise to salvation was good Mlstris Hall;
Something of Shakespeare .was in that, but
this

Thomas Quiney, who married Judith,
the poet's youngest daughter, was an ac
complished penman, as specimens of his

lately." The young barbarians of the*
poefs day thought it rare fun to pull the
feathers from a live goose. In "2 Henry
IV," when the Chief Justice says to Fal
staff. "Commend me to my cousin West
moreland," the fat old sinner mutters:
"If I do, fillip me with a three-man
beetle." He alluded to another cruel
sport that was common among Warwick
shire boys. A toad was put on one end
of a short board, placed across a small
log, and the other end was then struck
with a bat. throwing the creature high in
the air. This was called "filliping" the
toad. A "three-man beetle" was a heavy
rammer, with three handles and wielded
by three men in driving piles. Such a
beetle would be required for filliping a
weight like Falstaff.
"We need not wonder at these amuse
ments of the English boys when their
elders were fond of bear-baiting, bull
baltin?. cock-fighting, cock-throwing and
the like. To all thes*e wo find many refer
ences in Shakespeare; and they were pop
ular with all classes from sovereign to
peasant. Queen Elizabeth and her sister,
Mary, were both fond of bear-baiting-,
which was one of the "princely pleasures'*
provided by Leicester for the entertain
ment of the Queen at Kenllworth In 1375.
when thirteen great bears were worrlei
by bandogs. She loved the drama, but
in 1391. by a royal edict, forbade plays to
be performed on Thursday because bÂ«a.-
baitins? and similar spoita were usual on
that day. The clergy were as fond of
these diversions as their parishioners were
and a writer of 1572 says they would some
times "hurry the service over in a shame
ful manner." in order not to miss the spec
tacle. It Is recorded that in a Cheshire
town in 1501, when tho bear kept for bait-
Ing had died, "the corporation gave orders
to sell their Bible in order to purchase an
other." The modern inhabitants of the
town deny this, but it may be true.
Cock-fighting, to whfch Shakespeare al
ludes In "Antony and Cleopatra. "Ham
let" and "The Taming of the Shrew," -was
popular In England from the beginning
of the twelfth century at least, when It
was an amusement of schoolboys and
their Blasters on Shrove Tuesday, as ir
continued to be until the sixteenth cen
tury or later, and in Scotland down to tfc.<Â»
rrllddle of the eighteenth.
Cock-throwing, in which the bird was
tied to a stake and sticks thrown at It
until It was killed, is said to havs been
peculiar to England, and dates back to the
fourteenth century. It was regularly
practiced on Shrove Tuesday, and was not
uncommon a hundred years ago. Tha
cock was reckoned a "devil's messenger."
from his crowing after Peter's denial of
h;a Master, and clergymen made this an
excuse for their enjoyment In the sport.
Shakespeare nowhere refers to this vul
gar orejudice against the cock. but. In a
beautiful passage In "Hamlet," connects
the "bird of dawning" with the "hallowed
and gracious" associations of Christmas.
The small boy even now Is apt to be a
savage, and Shakespeare when a boy may
have been no better than' the average
Stratford urchin, but in his .plays an*l
poems he shows himself aa far m advanca
of his age in his love of animals and sym
pathy with their pain and suffering as ho
does In the broad humanity of his deline
ations of his fellow-men. He could feel
pity even for an insect that was trodden
upon. In .'-'Measure for Measure" Isabella
says to her brother:
The sense of death is most trt apprehension:
And the poor beetle that we tread upon.
In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great
As when a giant dies.
In "As Ton Like It** the banished duke
In the forest of Arden laments the neces
sity Of killing deer for food. In the samÂ«
play Touchstone, the philosophic fool,
gives a sly rap at people who find amuse
ment in brutal srarnea. When Le> Beau
tells - Rosalind and Cella that thpv hav*
"lost much fine sport" In not being pres
ent at the "good wrestling," where three*
young men have been so maimed that
they are likely to die. Touchstone asks:
"But what is the sport, monsieur, that th*
ladies have lost?" Le Beau replies: "Why,
this that I speak of." "Thus men may
grow wiser every day!" says Touchstone.
'â¢It Is the first time that ever I hear-1
breaking of ' ribs was sport for ladies!"
And yet the fine ladles of Shakespeare'^
day and Queen Bess herself delighted in
air manner of brutal sport involving 1 pain
and death to men and animals.

Noteâ A paper on Shakespeare's sonnets
by Professor Mims will be published on
Monday next.
private teachers we have abundant Infor
mation in Elizabethan literature, and
Shakespeare illustrates it dramatically In
"The Taming of the Shrew." In the first
scene Baptista says to the snitors for the
hand of his younger daughter Bianca:
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, and poetry.
Schoolmasters, will I keep within my house.
Fit to instruct her youth. If you. Hortenslo â
Or Signlor Oremio, youâ know any such.
Prefer them hither: for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in (food bringing- up.
Later Lucentio plots to get access to
the girl in the disguise of a teacher of
languages and Hortenslo gets Petruchlo
to introduce him
Disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music to instruct Biancaâ
that thus he may "have leave and leisure
to make love to her." I cannot take space
to quote from the amusing scene that fol
lows, in which lessons In Latin and in
music are given to Bianca by the rival
suitors. The reader, if not familiar with
it. will enjoy looking it up for himself.
School discipline for the boys was se
vere enough in those days. There was
no sparing of the rod. Peacham tells of
one pedagogue who used to whip his boys
of a cold morning "for no other purpose
than to get himself a heat." In an inter
lude of the time a boy who does not want
to be sent to school tells how his com
panions suffer there:
Their tÂ»nder bodies both night and day
Are whipped and scourged and beat like a
stone,
That from top to toe the skin is away.
Shakespeare has allusions to the -whip
ping of schoolboys in "Much Ado." "The
Shrew," "Lear" and elsewhere; and the
single instance in which he refers to the
birch is in connection with such discip
line, though parental rather than peda
gogical. It is in "Measure for Measure,""
where the Duke, speaking of a law which
for years has not been enforced, says:
Now, as fond fathers.
Havinc bound up the threatening twlgrs of
Only U> stick it In their children's sight.
For terror, not to use/ in time the rod '
Becomes more mock"d than fear/d. so our- de-
crees, ! *WW I
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead*
Shakespeare knew better than to draw
this illustration from school life.
We find various types of the Eliza
bethan schoolmaster in the plays. Some
times they combined the quack and the
conjurer with the pedagogue, like Pinch
in "The Comedy of Errors":
Alone with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced
â¢ villain.
A mere anatomy, a mountebank.
A threadbare Jug^ter and a fortune teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed. sharp-lÂ»okln* wretch.
A llvinsr dead man. This pernicious slave.
Forsooth, tookon him aÂ» a conjurer,. â¢ Â» .
And Razing In mine eyes, feeling my pulse.
And with no face, as 'twere, cutfacin* me.
Cries out, I was possessed.
Holof ernes, in "Love's Labor's Lost,"
though pedantic, Is a scholar, with a
genuine enthusiasm for study and teach
ing. The delineation, with something of
comic exaggeration of his foibles, Ik thor
oughly good-natured, and the same is true
of Sir Hugh Evans in "The Merry
Wives," who, like the poet's own masters
in the Stratford- School, was a clergyman.
That these -Stratford masters were men
of good scholarship and ability is evident
from the fact that they rapidly gained
promotion in the church.
If the boys had a hard time in school,
â¢with the stern discipline and the long
confinementâ about _ten hours a day, as
a, ruleâ they did not lack for diversion and
recreation out of doors and at home.
Many of the children's games . to which
Shakespeare refers -are familiar to the
little people now. especially in the rural
districts. Hide and seek is probably the
play that Hamlet had in mind when he
exclaimed, "Hide fox, and after." The
Prince also alludes to "blind man's buff"
under the old name of "hoodman blind."
It was also called "the hoodwink play,"
and the present name Is found in books
of the time as Vblindmanbuf." In the
grave-digging scene Hamlet asks: "Did
these bones cost no more the breeding
butito.play at loggats with them?" In
this game small logs of wood, somewhat
like "Indian clubs," were thrown at a
stake.- Bones were sometimes used, and
this probably suggested Hamlet's refer
ence. When I was at Amherst College,
fifty years ago, we had the same exercise
under, the name of "loggerheads," but I
have not seen it or heard of it anywhere
else. The game was for a time prohibited
by a statute of Henry VIII. Leap-frog
is mentioned in : "Henry V" and football
in "Lear" and in the "Comedy of Errors,"

It is a wonderful soap
that takes hold quick and
does no harm.
No harm ! It leaves the
skin soft like a-baby's; no
ff~!i in it, nothing but
soap. The harm is done by
alkali. .Still more harm is
done by not washingl So,
bad soap is better than
none.
What is bad soap? Ini- /
perfectly_made ; -the fat'

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. Jan. 30.â To-day's market was
inadÂ«> up cf movements in special stocks, evi
dently under the operations of speculative
cliques, who brought manipulation freely to
bear to aid the movements. An overwhelming
proportion of the total business was concen
trated in lwe than a dozen stocks, St. Paul,
Fteel and Wir* and Southern Pacific continuing
very prominent, but were supplemented by
large dealings in Rock Island and ?ome of
th* Southern stock*. The flirt live minutes
oC tiadlni? were eufflcier.t to demonstrate that
â¢wry powerful support was in the market. The
heavy offerings of St. Paul were freely bought
and it* decline wan checked at l.V>. The same
whf true in Northern Pacific and in the steel
stocks. Th* official color given to denials this
morning of the #o-caiied St. Paul deal and
the explicit assertion* that it was off brought
a large speculative sMling of the stock and the
Ftaterr.ent on behalf of the Steel and Wire
directors given out aft-r the clos* of the mar
ket yesterday was a weakening- Influence in the
eteel group. When the determined and effect
ive support at t^-* two threatening points
T*-a* observed the tone of the speculation was
etrengthenod and the prompt advance In Rock
Ifland and of various other stocka later In
the day served to sumain price* in the general
lirt. Selling to realize was going on actively
under cover of the strength in active mocks
end the market wu highly Irregular during
the T.-hole day. Under the Influence of the nm
upward Fpurt in Rock Island, which rose an
extreme 3'^. there were genera! recoveries. St.
Paul and other |eadlnÂ» stocks rising above last
r.'.Kht. The fact that the buying of Rock Isl
end was by brokers Identified with the sup
port in Steel and Wire arouces some distrust
of the movement and t'.ie subsequent aduncen
in special stocks were Â»if>t notably responded
to in the general list. St. Paul sold off later
to I*? 1 ! and rwÂ»d with a net loss of a point.
Southern Pacific suffered from heavy reallilng
en the Ftatement of December net earning*
showing the extraordinary increase of JS52.139
over December of the year before. Mobile and
Ohii continued to advance, rising 6Si on top
of yesterday's gain of h\j. No authentic in
formation Â«'ouid be secured during trading
hours as to the source of this buying, but It
was made the occasion by speculators for ad
vancing the Ftocks of various railroads which
might be tenefited by securing the control, in
cluding Southern Railway. Louisville, Chicago
and Alton and KanÂ«< City Southern. The
control ef the road 'is at present vested In
the bondholder* throujn a voting trust and it
it Â«ald that no controlling Interest in the stock
Js held by any one jiarty. Late in the day
the stee] stocks were marked up . vigorously
after resisting decline alt day. The rise in
Steel and Wire from the lowest reached 3H
In the preferred 2\i and in Federal Steel 2V t !
There were gains of lrom 1 to ivj by some
other members of the group. The engagement
of gold to-day for to-morrow's steamer make
a total ef I2,2iO.OOO. which. Is considerably less
than the prc-llminary t-stimate. But- sterling
exchange hero advanced further to-day than
It did In I'ari'S. and it is evident that a gold
movement from here to London is Imminent
Borrower* in London resorted to the Bank of
England to-day. s<hown:g that the efforts of
that institution to control the open market
nrf meeting with success. With A prospect
of gold belr,g thus drawn from New York it
eecms hardly probable that the bank rate will
be reduced to-morrow. .
Prices of bonds were well sustained to-day
rr. a good absorption. Total eaies, {3,9^.000.
United State* bonds were all unchanged.

CHICAGO, Jan. SO.â The wheat market was
a professional one throughout the session and
their trade was of a scalping order, content
â¢with Fmail deals and corresponding profits or
losses.- May opened He lower at ~G% to
76^c under the influence of Indifferent Liver
pool cables, the deep fall of snow and the de
lcyed announcement of Australian shipments
segregating 544,000 bushels last week. The
market declined early to 75}Â»c. where it held
Eteady for a time while a few small buying
orders were filled. The liberal receipts and
rmall world's shipments later caused further
selling pressure and May dropped to 75%c:
Shorts covered on the decline and the market
it-acted to 76Â»jc and closed ',2@ f ,ic down at 76Â®
7^e.
The feature In the corn ' trade was the al
most total absence of outside business. The
opening was easier on cables, a liberal country
movement and the excellent -weather. The
wheat weakness also told against the price.
There was scarcely any of the usual bull sup
port, while commission houses liad selling: or
ders from th<? start. May closed He lower. Â»
Oats were fairly active within a narrow
range. May closed a shade lower at 25^c.
Provisions were dull. Liberal hog receipts
rnd lower prices at the yards caused selling
at. the opening. Later covering bv shorts
caused a partial recovery and the close waÂ»
fairly steady. May pork closed 7>^c lower, May
lard "He down and May ribs 5Â©7V4c depressed.

The American department was active once
more. London was buying quietly of American
shares at the New York opening, but cabled
fcflllr.fr orders caused a setback. After that
this department was dull up to the close. The
chief demand for American stocks was in
Southern Railway. This buying was stimu
lated by the report that the Mobile and Ohio
and Southern Pacific *ecuritie3 were being
sought In a fight for control.
Money was a little stiffer to-day.

London Wool Sales.
BOSTON, Jan. SO.â The American Wool * and
Cotton ; Reporter will 'say 'to-morrow: '
The wool^market has been more active the
past -week , and a ; somewhat improved feeling
is noted in the' trade." Quite a number of? mills
have been represented In the market and some
fair sized lines of -wool have been taken. The
amount of business done ; considerably I exceeds
that of.the previous, week and we should esti
mate the volume of sales at about 3,oOO,000
pounds. 'These consist largely of Territories,
scoured, Oregons, medium fleeces, and de
laine wools. Some manufacturers express
themselves as satisfied with the â¢ orders
which t they have taken on overcoat
ings. Others' are still running; 'on
duplicate lightweights. While prices are upon
the whole in favor of the buyer. -there has not
been sufficient recession as yet to justify a
general lowering of quotations. In fact, in
some lines a pretty firm feeling prevails. This
is especially noticeable in quarter-blood fleeces
and delaine wools, as well as on scoured wools,
and eome sales have been made at full quota
tions. Sales for the week in Boston amounted
to 3,176.000 pounds domestic and 2S0.OOO pounds
foreign, making a total of 3,456.0tiO pounds,
against a total of 1.285.000 pounds for the pre
vious week, and a total of 4,514,000 pounds for
the corresponding week last year. The sales
since January 1 amount to 9,615,000 pounds,
against 17,163.600 pounds for the corresponding
time last year.

The Duke and Duchess of Manchester
and Lord\ Lambert left yesterday for
Monterey, where they will remain until
ihe first of , nex't week. The Duke has
been enjoying himself here and says he
regrets to leave. He has paid a couple
of visits to the Olympic Club, where he
had several rounds with the punching bag,
winding up with a plunge In the big tank.
It is not yet known whether
Eugene Zimmerman, father " of the
Duchess, will join the party at Del
Monte. Published reports are to the ef
fect that Papa Zimmerman had left Cin
cinnati for San Francisco, but. the Duke
has received no verification of them. Mr.
Zimmerman wired that he would start for
this city immedrately, after -receiving a
telegram from, the "Duke 'announcing the
Duchess" Illness, but the reassuring raes
sagen sent him a few hours later were
considered sufficient to induce Mr. Zlm

BRIEF LOCAL NEWS.
In the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday J. C. Campbell an
nounced to Judges Gilbert. Morrow and
Ross that the Chipps and Requa cases,
represented by himself and W. H. Metscn,
had been settled in accordance with an
agreement between them and Attorneys
Gunn and Kellogg at the time of the first
argument in the case. The agreement
was that if the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals should hold that It had
jurisdiction in the Cape Nome mining
cases Messrs. Gunn and KeUogg would
turn over the property to the clients of
Messrs. Campbell and Metson in accord
ance with the writ of supersedeas, which
forms the basis for the present contempt
proceedings. The question of jurisdiction
having been determined, the property was
duly turned over, he added. Mr. Camp
bell, therefore, declared that he was will
ing to withdraw all the proceedings or to
submit them to the court on the testimony
taken in the Comtols, Kjellman and
Rogers cases. *
Judge Ross replied that it was a matter
entirely with the court as to the disposi
tion of cases of contempt, and that so far
as he was concerned the suggestion of
counsel as to dismissal would not be en
tertained. An adjournment was thereupon
had until Monday morning at 11 o'clock. .

calculations covered the minutest details
of the work. " â¢Â¦
The witness said th.-Â»t he had examined
the entire system of the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company and had computed the cost
of the various parts <Â»f " the plant. ThÂ»
total value of the system, allowing the
standard rate of deterioration, he gave as
$2,9^0,537. This closely approximates th*Â»
results obtained independently by the oth
er experts already examined. Professor
Marx estimated the value at $2,f>74 701 and
Engineer Moore put it at J2.9S8. C29.
â¢ Engineer Riffle's testimony was unique
in that it was the first given so far In the
trial to which no exceptions were taken
by counsel. The estimates were palpably
liberal, and In each case 25 per cent was
added for contingencies, in all cases he
allowed for the use of Portland cement

most of the earlier >\->rk was done wit'i

TRAINERS.
One of the Ruffians Brutally Twists Both Wrists of the Lady and
Forces Her to Release Her Hold of the Animal, Which Is
Carried Away Despite the Vehement Protests of Its Guardian
the lady was compelled to relinquish her
hold on her four-footed pet.
Mrs. Green 13 a pretty English woman,
and her home might be described as an
asylum for dumb anlmata, for she has
cats, parrots, doss. etc.. m number. These
animals are cared for with the greatest
kindness by Mrs. Green, for she is enthu
siastic oh the subject o? gentleness to
dumb creatures. A week ago her husband
asked her If she would take charge of a
young hound that was In need of & friend,
and Mrs. Green installed the animal la
the basement of her homÂ«. To prevent
the hound from running away, it was
chained up. Yesterday morning Mrs.
Green released the animal and allowed It
to sit by her side on the front porch of
her residence. Adjoining Mrs. Green's
home is a larga vacant lot. which i*
fenced in and on which Mr. Green has an
option. A stray dos attracted the atten
tion of Mrs. Green's hound and the ani
mal ran into the vacant lot. At that mo
ment the hated pound wagon, with its
satellites, drove up Clement street and
the poundmen jumped from their wagon
and cast their nets around Mrs. Green'3
hound and Its companion. The plucky
English woman at once sallied forth and
went to the rescue of her charge, which
was yelping loudly. She threw herself on
the net and clasped the do?, while she
informed the poundmen that they were
trespassing on private property. They did
not heed her warning, but insisted that
she give up the dog. "You are a pack of
cowards." she said, "and you would not
dare act this way if a man were here.
You shall not take my dog. He Is on our
own ground and you have no right to be
here at all."
The altercation between Mrs. Green and
the poundmen attracted a number of her
female neighbors, and these ladles all b*ar
witness to the brutal treatment accorded
to Mrs. Green by the dog catchers. One
of the ruffians, whose name could not be
learned, but who wore a bad^e, "So. 4."
seized the lady by the wrists and twisted
them until the pain forced her to release
her hold on the dog. Wltti an oath and
a brutal lau^h. the men carried the dojr
to their wagon, while friends conducted
JFrs. Green to her home. "When she was
sufficiently recovered she proceeded down
town to her husband's office. 405 Mont
gomery street, and told him of the out
rageous conduct of the poundmen toward
her.
Mr. Green at once went to the Hall of
Justice and swore out a warrant for as
sault and battery against the poundmen.
who were designated as "John Doe" and
"Richard Roe." The warrants were given
to the police for service. Both Mr. and
Mrs. Green are determined to do all in
their power to punish the dog catchers
for their brutal conduct. When seen last
evening. Mrs. Green exhibited a number
of bruises on her arms and wrists, the
result of the rough handling she had re
ceived.

millionaire. j
In all the catalogue Includes the eight j
thoroughbred stallions. 107 brood mares j
and seventy-six race horses in training. !
1 he first animal to.be offered was the)
famous stallion Hamburg. . When the ;
stallion was brought into the ring the btd- j
ding commenced ' at 125,000. It was im- â¢
mediately raised by cne bid to $40,000. then H
to J41.000 and next-'to $15,000. Here the j
figure stood for a moment and then ad- I
vanced by easy stages to 35S.000 and final- y
ly to JGO.COO. For that sum the horse at 'Â¦
last was sold to William C. Whitney, be- j
ing bid in by John F. Madden, who j
formerly sold Hamburg to Mr. Daly. The j
principal opposing bidder was J. B. Hag- j
gin, the California horseman, owner of j
the famous stud at Roncho del Paso.
Hamburg, a son of Hanover and Lady i
Reel, was foaled In 1895 and was pur- '
chased by Mr. Daly from John Madden ',
at the reported prire of $41,000. As a two- j
year-old he. won twelve out of sixteen j
starts, was second three times and third i
once. The next season he lost the Bel- J
mOnt stakes to Bowling Broke by a close
margin, but Immediately after began a
phenomenal series of successes, during
which he won the First Special at Graves
end, the Swift and Realization at Sheeps
head Bay and the Brighton cup at Brigh
ton Beach. He was retired as a three
year-old and placed in the stud.

Grape-Nuts Turned Into Big Build-

The duties cif an architect are bo multi-
tudinous, looking after the thousand and
one details required in the construction of
large buildings, that many of them cuffer
from the constant mental application and
require the best of food to keep up their
wrrk. The chief 'draughtsman in the
rffice of R. T. Newberry. architect, at
:r.T New York Life Building-. Chicago, by
name. Henry C. Hengels, says:
"After nine months' constant applica-
tion in the preparation of the necessary
plar.s and details for the large hotel
kr.own as the Post Tavern and the Post
Building, at Battle Creek, as well as sev-
eral other large institutions, I found my-
self in a very debilitated and dyspeptic
condition and unfit for work.
"Instead of medical treatment I used
Crape-Nuts food In place of the usual
breakfast cereals. The first few days
gave great encouragement, and after a
week's use. quite an appreciable improve-
ment manifested Itself. Since then, daily
Cfe has entirely restored the digestive
functions to their natural healthy condi-
tion, and I have gained about one pound
p<"T week. I am now entirely well and
etrong again and am able to apply my-
felf to work with more than usual vigor.
I consider Crape-Nute a most valuable
food for all brain workers. The help
this food has given me is incalculable."

BEAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
NICE, Jan. 30.â The bullfight which was
to have taken place here, last Sunday was
postponed until to-day. The seats were
all taken. The majority of those ln at
tendance were Frenchmen, who became
very much excited as the fight progressed.
Many seats were occupied by English
visitors wearing mourning- garb, who
watched the proceedings with phlegmatic
curiosity.
Six bulls were let, into the arena. One
of them knocked a man down, but the
toreadors prevented the animal from gor
ing him.- %,
The cleverest toreador was a youth of
15 years, who displayed marvelous agility
in dodging.- The bulls frequently tried to
leap the barrier, and this caused wild ex
citement. One horse was brought Into
the arena, but the bull's horns were then
covered with rubber cushions. The bulls
were the only sufferer/. Throughout the
performance darts- were stuck Into their
necks, and one of them was viciously
stabbed with a lance, but was not killed.
The exhibition was allowed by the Mayor
only on condition that the animals should
not be killed or maimed.

an enthusiastic convention called to
order here to-day by feidney Clarke of
Oklahoma City, chairman of the State
hood Executive Committee. Every county
in both Territories was well represented.
The convention was called to order at
2 o'clock . in the afternoon by Sidney
Clarke. O. R. Fegan welcomed the dele
gates and Hon. F. E. Gillette of Canadian
County responded. Ex-Senator L. E.
Havens was elected temporary chairman
and in addressing the delegates made an
eloquent plea tor statehood that aroused
lively interest.
The temporary organization was made
permanent. The, two hundred or -more
delegates here are unanimous for state
hood at the "earliest minute possible. The
majority of them are for single statehood
for Oklahoma, although the minority, who
favor both Territories being -included in
one State, are aggressive enough to make
their claims have weight.

MILAN, Jan. 30.â The funeral of Â¦Verdi
took place to-day, all the authorities
following 1 the bier. . The ceremony .was
most simple but most Impressive,', owing
to the silent homage of the populace, who
were . present at the service in immense
numbers. - " -
The,.remains of Verdi Â¦were borne- from
his residence and placed in a' modest
funeral car, which, followed by a few in
timate friends, proceeded to the Church
of St. Francis, the facade of which bore
the inscription. "Peace, to the Soul- of
Gluseppl Verdi." â. . .
The religious ceremony lasted only five
minutes. Then a procession was formed,
headed by priests, and with firemen,
marching 1 beside the car, which was fol
lowed by friends of the deceased, the local
authorities and leading: citizens bare
headed. A great crowd lined the route
and people even climbed the trees to get a
glimpse of the cortege. Several houses
were draped in maurning. , . .
On the arrival of the body at the ceme
tery the crowd was so large that two
squadrons of carbineers were unable to
keep open a space around the graveside.
The remains of the composer were in
terred without ceremony and I there were
no speeches. - .... ...

SIMPLE SERVICE OVEB
THE BO DY OF VEBDI
There was also considerable discussion
of the irrigation of the arid lands in con
nection with the paragraph providing for
an investigation, of that subject. The bill
was aassed. :
The "friends of the farmer" were much
in evidence during the day, and against
an aggressive opposition, led by Mahon
of Pennsylvania, voted into the bill an
additional appropriation of $50,000 for
"farmers* bulletins."
Upon this showing the House adopted
the amendment, whereupon King retal
iated by offering an amendment provid
ing that none of the money should go to
any of the colleges In any State whose
instructors or trustees have engaged in
lynching or been guilty of fornication. He
afterward modified it so as to apply only
to the Agricultural College of Indiana. It
was overwhelmingly defeated.
Subsequently, when the bill was report
ed to the House, the Landis amendment
was stricken out by a vote of 69 to 19.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â The anti-po
lygamy crusade which resulted in driving
Roberts of Utah out of the House of Rep
resentatives at the last session had an
echo In the 'House to-day during the con
sideration of the agricultural bill. When
the section making appropriation for the
agricultural colleges of the several States
was reached, Landis of Indiana offered an
amendment ' providing ' that no money
should be paid to the college In Utah un
til . the Secretary of the Treasury was
satisfied that no trustee or teacher in the
institution practiced polygamy. The
amendment came as a complete surprise.
King, who succeeded Roberts, tried in
vain to head it off with a point of order
and then inveighed against it as simply
an aftermath of the Roberts crusade. He
Insisted that polygamy was a thing of
the past. Landis replied by alleging that
two of the professors of. the Utah Agri
cultural College were polygamists. and
that one of the trustees had seven wives
and thirty-nine children.

cultural College Has Seven

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â The shipping
bill was kept it; the front in the Senate
throughout â¢ to-day. â¢ No appreciable
progress was made, most of the time be
ing occupied' by Turley of Tennessee and
Jones* of Arkansas in speeches opposing
the bill, and severely arraigning its al
leged favoritism. â¢
'Earlier in the day an unsuccessful effort
was made to secure agreement to the
conference report ; on the army reorgani
zation bill. â¢
At*2 o'clock the shipping bill was laid
before the Senate as. the unfinished busi
ness, but as the army conference report
was Btilli proceeding Aldrich' asked that
the shipping bill be laid aside temporarily.
Pettigrew. promptly objected. This cre
ated a -parliamentary blockade which
compelled either the subsidy bill or the
army bill to give way. . . ,â¢;""
Hawley, in charge of the army bill, con
cluded to yield, and gave notice that he
would ; call up, that measure the. first thing
to-morrow". ' = ;
'. Consideration of the subsidy bill being
resumed, Aldrich- gave notice of ; two
amendments, one providing that appli
cants for subsidy ehall contract to build
a new vessel within the United States
within three years and a second providing
that the utmost limit of subsidy shall be
fifteen years instead of twenty years, as
provided in the bill. ' Â¦-â¢
Turley of Tennessee spoke against tne
bill, pointing out the large expenditures
involved. He declared that already the
shipping Interests had unusual privileges
under the tariff, the postal bounty laws,
and in many other ways.
: Turley compared the cost of ship-bund
ing in various countries. This brought
out a statement from . Vest that ships
could be built for less in the United States
,than in 'any other country. As proof of
this, he said, Japan had' advertised for
the lowest and best bid on a cruiser and
the American bidders had taken the con
tract, underbidding the British ship
builders by 20 per cent. Later, when Rus
sia called for like bids, the American
builders again underbid the foreigners.
Only two weeks ago, Vest said, the
Cramps had secured a contract for build
ing a cruiser for Turkey as against all
other competitors. â â¢
Turley spoke for two hours and was fol
lowed by- Jones of Arkansas in opposition
Â¦to the measure. Jones said the bill pro
posed to take millions out of the public
treasury and give it as a free gift to cer
tain favored r 'subsidy beggars." One of
,the worst features of the measure, he
said, was that the vast sums to be paid
as^subsldies-to a few wealthy concerns
were wrung from the laboring people and
the poor./ â¢ Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ - Â¦ "
Jones said the bill should be entitled "a
bill to enable a select coterie of ship-own
ers to loot the United States Treasury."
He argued that commercial development
and extension must come from our natu
ral, advantages and enterprise and not
fpÂ«m the legislative stimulus of subsidies.
Jones spoke for two hours and then Ber
ry of Arkansas called for the formal read
ing of the bill. This brought on a con
troversy as to the present form of the
bill.
Frye declared that Democratic Senators
were delivering New York Reform Club
speeches against the measure, apparently
believing it was the Hanna bill of two
years ago, whereas it had been entirely
changed t and bore little resemblance to
that measure. â¢â¢ C-- Â¦..'.".â¢'. " -
Morgan said he thought. very few Sen
ators Know what was in the bill. He had
been "fox hunting" trying to . locate
amendments and learn what was in the
bill, but had been unable to do so.
Jones of Arkansas also spoke of the
kaleidoscopic changes and the Inability of
the people to keep track of it.
As a matter of information the detailed
reading of the bill was agreed to.
After the formal reading of .the bill it
was temporarily laid aside. / i

hatchery and fish station in,Idaho.

GATHER AROUND
BANQUET BOARD
Frequent' complaints ' of " similar at
tempted snatchlngs of articles of jewelry
have been made to the police for some
time past, particularly at the time of day
when the cars are crowded. Jones, how
ever, has been clever enough to .avoid
capture until he met Bennett. *
Although but about 25 years of age.
Jones is regarded* by the police as a dan
gerous man to be at large. He was re
moved to the Southern police station and
later to the Hall of Justice. The two
men he tried to rob will, prefer .charges
of attempted robbery against him this
morning. Both Bennett and Lange are
positive In their identification of the man.
Among those attracted to the sceflfc was
Hermann N. Lange, secretary of the
Inglenook Vineyard Company, residing at
151 Valencia street. He recognized Jones
as the young man who on Friday night
last made an attempt to snatch a pin
from his scarf while he was riding home
ward on the same car line and about the
same hour. /
Bennett was on his way home from
work and was about to get on a car when
a young man approached him. threw an
overcoat against his face and grabbed at
a diamond stud in Bennett's necktie.
Quick as a flash Bennett's right arm shot
out. It caught Jones squarely on the
jaw and landed him on the sidewalk. The
crowd, attracted by the scuffle aided
Bennett in retaining the custody of his
prisoner.
W. H. Bennett of 2022 California street
with a lusty blow of his strong right arm
placed a young: man named Frank L.
Jones out of the diamond snatching busi
ness yesterday afternoon at the corner of
Third and Townsend streets and held his
prisoner captive until Police Officers

THIS MORNING
Hall's wife visited him late last night
at the City Prison, whore he will be heid

quest. She said that she was at the home
of her sister at tho corner of Valencia
and Twenty-second streets when she
heard of the shootlnsr.
I just took the names of me brothers
in-law."
The dead burglar Is about 22 or 23 years
of age, of slender build and clean shaven.
He has bushy red hair. A front tooth Is
missing on the right side of the upper
jaw. A search of his clothing brought to
light nine neckties, two knives, a picklock
for spring locks, a package of tobacco, a
purse containing 25 cents and a memoran
dum book on which was written, "I am
coming from home. J. J. McCormlck,"
and the address, "J. C. Douglass, South
Main, S. D."
The bullet that ended his career entered
on the left side of the head back of ths
ear and ranged into the brain, producing
instant death.
"The sale of these pieces of property,"
said one of Mrs. Harrison's attorneys yes
terday, "is not to be understood as mean
ing that she Intends dlspoaing of all her
interests In the State. She still holds an
undivided one-third interest in the hom<Â»
property and also in an unimproved lot
on the corner of Sutter street and -Van
Ness avenue. Her other interests are In
the Crocker Estate Company. The only
reason she disposed of the interest sh<3
had in the properties sold was that she
did not care. to assume her share of the
cost of improvements. The improvement's
on thÂ« Powell-street land will cost fully
$1,000,000, and the Mission-street improve
ments will cost between $300,000 and-$400.
000. It is her intention to retain her inter
est in the Crocker Estate Company and
also In the other two pieces of property
not involved In the sale. The report that
she intends disposing of all her Interests
In California is without foundation. *
The sale was made by Mrs. Harrison
through her attorneys. Messrs. Morrison
& Cope. Since her marriage she has been
a resident of New York city and is now
having built there a residence that will,
when completed, cost fully a half-million
dollars. The guardians of the estates of
her brother and sister, who are .minors,
decided some time ago to Improve -tho
property on Powell and Geary streets and
also the Mission and First street property.
They also contemplate the improvement
of the property at the corner of Bush and
Battery streets. Mrs. Harrison did not
feel Inclined to share the cost of these
Improvements and announced her willing
ness to sell her Interest in the properties
involved. The guardians of the minor chil
dren deemed it best to buy her interest
and on the 23d inst. the sale was consum
mated.
Mrs. Mary Burton Harrison, eldest
daughter of the late Colonel Fred
Crocker, recently sold her undivided one
third interest in three pieces of realty in
this city to her brother, Charles Temple -
ton Crocker, and her sister, Jennie A.
Crocker. The principal piece of property
involved in the sale is the site of the old
Calvary Presbyterian Church, northwest
corner of Powell and Geary streets. Tho
next most valuable piece is situated- en
the corner of Mission and First streets.
The third piece is on the corner of Bush

Mrs. Harrison for her 'nterest In the three
pieces of property was $232,562 52.

Woods gave his age as 18 years and his
occupation as that of a teamster. Th-a
prison records show, however, that on
January 6. 1899, he was sent to the House
of Correction to serve sixty days for petty
larceny. He then traveled under the
name of Fred Keefer and was 20 years
old. In March of the following year he
was arrested under the name of Fred Wil
son, for burglary. The charge was re

guilty he was sent to jail for six months.
He claims that his true name Is WIlsou

SCEXE OF THE SHOOTING OF A BURGLAR. WHO. WHILE ATTEMPT
ING TO ESCAPE, MET DEATH BY A BULLET FIRED FROM REVOL
VER TAKEN FROM HIS CONFEDERATE.
Edward H. Hall, a Barber, on Returning to His Room Finds Two
Cracksmen at Work and After Disarming One of Them
Sends a Bullet Through the Other, Killing H m as He Runs
EDWARD II. HALL, a barber, sur
prised two burglars while they
were rifling his room in the lodg
ing-house at 122 Taylor street last
night and after a desperate strug
gle shot and killed one of them. The con
federate of the dead cracksman cave his
name as George Woods. He was identified
at the City Prison as a criminal v.ho. un
der the r.ames of Fred Keefer and Wilson,
graduated from the House of Correction
and County Jail. Woods tried to us* n
revolver on Hall. Hall closed in on him.
wrested the weapon from his grasp and
with it shot the second burglar as ho
came running out of the room. Woods
escaped from the lodging-houM after the
shooting. He was caught on Eddy street
in front of the B'nai Brith Hall by R. J.
Corcoran, who lives at 1Â£3 Cedar avenue.
The story of the killing as told by HaU
was corroborated In every detail by
Woods, who only appeared reticent when
asked to give the name of his dead con
federate. He claims that the decease!
was a Ftrar.ger to him. and that they first
met Tuesday night m a saloon on Market
street, opposite Powell. The police feel
confident that the dead man was no nov
ice in the burglary line.
Hall is employed in a barber shop at
375 Fifth street, ana after Quitting work
last r.ight went directly to his room on
Taylor street. Ho and his wife occupy
room 12. on the second floor of the house.
The room is near the head of the stair
way leading from the street.
"It must have been pretty close to 9
o'clock." said Hall, when telling the story
of his encounter to Captain Seymour and
a group of reporters, "when I got home.
When I reached the room door I found It
closed and locked. I rapped on it, ex
pecting to have it opened by my wife.
To my surprise the prisoner. Woods,
opened it. When I eaw him I knew that
there was something wrong. The room
has been robbed twice before and I felt
certain that I had accidentally dropped
in on top of the burglars. 'What are you
doing here?' I asked. 'The lady has gone
*>ut and won't be back for half an hour.'
replied Woods, in an easy, self-possessed
tone. I grabbed him by the collar of tha
coat and dragged him into the hallway,
intending to ring the landlady's bell to
summon assistance. Woods reached into
his coat pocket and drawing a revolver
placed the muzzle of It against my
stomach. He kept pulling at the trigger,
but fortunately lor me it would not work
at that time. I realized that if I did not
soon overpower him my life was lost. I
pot a better grip on his throat and with
an effort threw him to the floor. I fell
on top of him and we renewed the strug
gle for the weapon. All this time he was
calling out. 'Kid. Kid. help me.' Just as
I wrenched the revolver out of his hand
the second burglar dashed out of my
room. He came toward me on the run.
and fearing that he was armed I raised
the revolver I had taken from Woods and
fired. The second man staggered back a
few feet and then went crashing head
long down the stairs leading to the street.
As soon as I released my hold on Woods
he sprang to his feet and darted for the
stairs. I followed n:m. He jumped over
the body of his dead confederate at the
bottom of the stairway and turned up
Taylor street.
"The report of the pistol attracted the
attention of some citizens who were pass
ing the house and they gave chase to
Woods. I afterward learned that one of
them caught him in front of B'nal Brlth
Hall. When I Ftaot. I feared that my life
was in danper."
