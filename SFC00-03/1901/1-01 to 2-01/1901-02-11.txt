that the joints of th? city must po at

the time when the clean*! ng of the city
must be made coir.r'er- If it is not done
by that time an arm> of a thousand men
â¢will Immediately m"V<> upon the joints
and remove them by forcp.
The meeting this afternoon was remnrk-
Eble in every respect. It waf called by a
committee cf the Law Enforcement
league and was attended by nearly all
the prominent business men of the city.
Conservative men, who have heretofore
advocated moderation. Insist that the
People of Topeka fhall take the law in
their own hand?. An ultimatum was
passed commanding the officers of the
city 'and county to perform their duty re
garding tBe clours: of the Joints.
The property owners on whose premises
the Joints are kept were warned that they
had better sbate the nuisances at once
or the people of Topeka would not be re
fpor.sible for the damage that might en-'
tjp to the buildings.
The jointists were warned in the follow
ing vigorous terms that Topeka. did not
desire their presence any longer:
"To tho?e illegally engaged in this illicit
business, we have to Fay that the long
fontrox^rsy of the public with you must
rome to an end. You have openly and
persistently defied our laws: you have
made yourselves the agents of even great
er criminals outside of the State who
have supported you in your unlawful traf
fic; you have introduced the most corrupt
ing and demoralizing factors and infiu
pnrrs into oi:r local pojities. and for years
you have scorned all appeals and warn
ji-cs that have been presented to you by
The virtu"- loving portion of the commun
ity. lOw we Ife"l that tnetime lias come

You must stop this lawless business at
once. We hereby notify you that we must
l,ave satisfactory evidence that all your
illicit poods shall have been removed and
shipped from the city before 12 o'clock
noon Friday. February 15..l-*pon the strict
observance of this demand we shall in-
Fist, and if it shall be disregarded we will
take whatever measures are necessary for
its risrid enforcement.
â¢"If a long outraged public shall be com
pelled to resort to the fundamental rig-ht
of self-vindication against criminals and
their abc-ttcrf, the grave consequences to
evildoers, which may result from such
a return, must rest with the defiers and
mjllif.ers of our laws and the obstructors
f f our governmental machinery. The
jolntists, the men who rent property to
jointists and the men who have violated
their oaths in tolerating crime, these are
the disturbers of the peace, and not the
wronged public, which as sovereign, has
both the right and the duty to see that
its will and judgment shall be respected."
Thfre were a number of addresses, in
T.hieh Mrs. Nation came in for her full
share.
Chief of Police Stahl made an address.
He paid the law could be enforced if the
entire police of the city would work in
unison with him.
Twelve hundred men signed their names
to cards pledging themselves to be ready

which has been recruited to stamp out
the joints by the time the limit set by
the ultimatum expires.

DENOUNCE SMASHER'S METHOD.
Mrs. Nation.
Women of Denver Who Differ From
DENVER, Feb. 10.â Colorado women be
lieve in the advancement of their sex and
exercise the right of suffrage, but de
nounce Mrs. Carrie Nation's methods of
teir.rerance reform. Of twenty leading
Denver women inter\*iewed, not one of
them favored saloon smashing. Here arc
some opinions:
Mrs. James B. Orman, wife of the Gov
ernor of Colorado: "From the little I have
thought of the matter, her methods, seem
somewhat extreme and ill considered. I
can hardly bring myself to believe that
much good ran eomo of such violence. I
f hould be glad to pr-e a high license on the
liquor traffic, if not a prohibitory law in
Colorado. It is a question in my mind
whether the prohibitory law brings
the jrrcatcst good to the greatest num
ber."
Mrs. T. M. Patterson, wife of the United
States Senator-elect: "I think there is just
about as' much reason in the methods of
Mrs. Nation as In lynching. Both are the
rrsult of revolution against a strictly pro
hibitive law and both, though intrinsical
ly bad. ar<> In one way almost Justifiable
by the circumstances. I am devoted to
the temperance cause, but such methods
as Mrs. Nation's seem to me to be some
what, extreme."
Mrs. Jam<Â»s P. Whitmore, president of
the Women's Club: "I suspect that no one
takeÂ« Mr*. Nation very seriouajy, and I
arn quite sure that she -will not accomplish
much good by hor performances. I am In
terested In the temperance cause, but I
consider her methods are rather more sen-
sational than rational, and I hardly think
she will do much to. advance it."
GOVERNOR'S SON IS CANDID.
Condemns Father's Inaction and
Commends Mrs. Nation's
Course.
"WICHITA, .Kins., Feb. 10.â In yester
day's "issue of the Orange, the official
paper of Baker University. Harry Stanley,
son of Governor Stanley and editor of the
Orange, strongly condemns his father's
Inaction In prohibitory matters, and as
strongly commends the course of Mrs.
Nation. He says in part:
'â¢When a Joint has been allowed to con
tinue in open violation of law, as the Sen
ate in Topeka has done, almost under the
very eyes of those who have sworn to en
force the laws and uphold the constitution
of the State, then the people welcome any
one with moral courage to do what State
and local officers, in direct violation of
their oaths of office, failed to do."
"lyong live Mrs. Nation," says the
Orange.
Commenting upon ihe editorial young
Stanley said:
"I had my father In mind when I wrote
this, and am sorry that he had to be
roasted, but think he oupht to have the
moral rourape to do his duty. I am not
In favor of allowing laws to be violated,
even if It will make vote "

v.-eek she will not meet with a pleasant
reception from her husband if be remains
in his present state of mind. To-day he
gave out an interview In which he severe
ly criticized his*wjfe for touring the East.
"She should remain in Kansas, where
she can do some good." he said. "I don't
approve of her going all over the East and
making a show of herself, as people there
only want to make fun of her.. I think
Fhe is showing to the world that she is
losing her nerve, instead of telling them
how she did things'out here. People have
read in the papers how she smashed sa
loon?. If she starts to raise any row In
Chicago and other Tvns I hope they will
put her In jail and make her suffer for it.
I took her part and spent several hundred
hard-earned dollars while she was fight

In this connection it is well to note that

do so again if ehe fails to please him.

Major Crewe'a Column Has Lively
Battle With the Boers.
EAST LONDON, Cape Colony. Feb. 10.â
Details have been received here of severe
fighting at Tabaksberg Mountain, forty
miles east of the railway, about midway
between Smalldeel and Bloemfontein. Ma
jor Crewe, with a composite column trav
eling south-west, sighted the mountain on
the morning of January 31. Ho heard
heavy firing, and knowing that Colonel
Pitcher's column was on the other side
of the mountain he concluded that this
officer was In action. Consequently he
hurried forward, only to meet the Boers
streaming down and evidently retiring
from Colonel Pitcher's lyddite shells. Im
mediately Major Crewe brought three flf
teen-pounders and a pompom to bear on
the Boers, who. however, were found to
be so numerous, that It was Impossible to
head them off. Orders, were given to re
turn to camp, about two miles from the
mountain. The column re'sted until 4
o'clock in the afternoon, when the march
was resumed southwest.
Major Crewe was Just touching the
southern point of the mountain when a
terrific rifle fire opened from a large force
of Boers in ambuscade on the mountain.
The light soon became general.. the Boers
attacking the British on both flanks and
the rear. The British pompom Jammed
and became useless. Major Crewe
grasped the situation and by ti brilliant
move got the convoy Into a safe position.
Between 7 and S In the evening the Boers
charged the position and turned both
flanks. The British ammunition became
exhausted and Major Crewe was oblisred
to retire and abandon the pompom after
the advance party had endeavored to save
It and had sustained severe losses.
A rear-guard action was fought by Ma
jor Crewe into the camp where the wagons

night. A round of shots in the seventh

poured rapidly Into tho drift. The pumps,
which lift 1800 gallons a minute, were
powerless against the flow.
Klght men in the drift ran for their
Jives and gave the haste call for the cage
which was sent down the shaft at full
speed.
The water was roaring through the drift
and plunging down the shaft. At the next

they climbed up. The pumpmen's top
boots were full of water, so fast had the
flood risen, and. hanging by bands to the

MADRID, Feb. 11.â The banquet given
at the palace last evening by the Queen
Regent in honor of Prince Charles of
Bourbon,- who will wed the Princess of
the Asturias, and of his parents, the
Count and Countess of Caser^a, was an
extremely brilliant affair. On the right
ot the Regent sat the Count of Caserta,
the Infanta Maria Teresa, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Marquis Agullar de

ister of Marine, Vice Admiral Ramos
Izqulerdo. On her left sat Prince Charles
of Bourbon, the Princess of the Astu
rias, the President of the Chamber of

The Regent's mother. Archduchess Eliza
beth, sat opposite her, with distinguished
guest3 ; on each side. The Regent's
brother, Archduke Eusene, arrived at
neon and will attend the court ball to
morrow. Â¦ '
It is estimated that some forty of the
Cabinet Ministers will be present at the
wedding. It Is now probable that the
bride and bridegroom will not appear in
the streets, but that the function, will be
carried out entirely within the palace
walls. â¢
Six hundred students have sent an ad
dress to the Minister of Public'Instruc

with the son of one who caused the na

of the event. â¢ _

V V . follow in *he footsteps of Wil
.-Ham WTaldorf Â» Astor and be
come a British subject? That Is the ques
tion that Is buzzing about in the circle of
the Four Hundred of the staid old Quaker
City. Gossip says that the glamour of the
court of St. James Is to the banker what
the flame is to the moth, and that he Is
fluttering about In the light that beats
upon a throne in quest of recognition as the
friend of a King and enrollment In the list
of those favored of the nobility. To these
reports the" banker and his family have
entered tierce denial. At> the same time
he has never denied that he took pleasure
In spending' a great deal of time In the
capitals of Europe, especially London. Mr.
and . Mrs. Drexel were always in attend
ance at the receptions : of Queen Victoria,
at such times when they were in London.
They were treated with distinction by Ed
ward when he 'was Prince of Wales. He
was several times a guest of the Drexels
at their London residence. Â¦
There will be places of social distinction
i for several Americans In- the court of
King Edward. Queen Victoria was much
given to receiving American families at
the Windsor and Osborne House drawing
room receptions, but she never came Into
such intimate acquaintance with any of
the republic's men and women as has
King Edward VII and his Queen, Alex
andra.- Â¦
. The social prestige of Mrs. Paget. who
was Miss Stevens, was admitted in the
reign of Victoria, and â¢ already the news
has come that the Duchess of Marlbor
ough, who was Consuelo Vanderbllt, Is
to be officially one of the new Queen's la
dies. Both of these women have become
British subjects.
Two other Americans who hold a high
place in the esteem of his Majesty are
Mr. and Mrs. Anthony J. Drexel of Phil
adelphia. Mr. and Mrs. Drexel spend
many months every year abroad, and
their children are being educated at Eng
lish schools. In taking up their abode In
London Mr. and Mrs. Drexel did not dis
guise the fact that they were ambitious
to get Into society, and in this they had
the friendship and influence of Mrs. Paget.
The result has been that they have been
every where ' received, and that when the
period of mourning has passed from the
court of St. James, Mr. and Mrs. Drexel
will be prominent guests at royal func
tions. . .::â¢,-. w

The place of amusement it plans to visit
first is the Tivoli; for is it not a place of
amusement frequently attended by minors
and is not liquor sold there? After the
legislators have seen enough to be able
to report intelligently, so far as the Tivoli
is concerned, they will go to the Orpheum,
and after the last picture of the blograph
has sputtered itself out at that "place of

By the time the Olympia has been proper

that will be taken under the pretense of

The committee does not contemplate any

members are taking much credit to them
selves for their forbearance in going only
to San Francisco, when by the resolution
they might go to any part of California,
however remote and however little bear
ing its conditions might have on the bills
in question. Their self-restraint is prob
ably due to a conviction that the Ways

MOST EXTBAORDINARY
JUNKET ON REC0B.D
y^=^7 ALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
(( Z MENTO. Feb. 10.â It is not often
IL j that twice in a week the country
members hii.ve a chance to see San
Francisco squirming on the legis
lative griddle. The oiennlal pastime is
generally confined to once in- a session,
but on Tuesday tast and again on Friday
the toasting fork, was driven through the
city's wifih.>ox.e, and it was held up, wrig
gling, for the edification of the State. The
occasion was the consideration of the
health bills that have emanated from the
office of the Governor.
On Tuesday night a delegation from San
Francisco appeared before the ) health
committees of the Senate and Assembly.-
Those who spoke were listened to and
questioned, and from the manner of the
legislators one would have been willing
to deny that the course of the bills was
a foregone conclusion, and that the city
delegation might Just as well have re
mained at home. The 5100.000 appropria
tion bill, designed to ampliry the funda
at the Governor's disposal* had already
passed the Assembly with an ease pecu
liar to measures which cinch the city, and
the day after the city delegation had
made its plea the bill was taken up by
the Senate Committe on Health and with
in two minutes a decision to report It fa
vorably, with the additional recommenda
tion that it be referred to the Finance
Committee, had been reached. Two. of
those who voted for it, Bettman and Nel
son, are of the city delegation.
Practically the feame delegation appeared
on Friday night before the Judiciary Com
mittee of the Assembly to protest against
two more bills of the same series. There
are some San Francisco men on the .com
mittee, but they all belong to the same
influence that is behind the bills, and
there is no guarantee that the Assembly
committee will not follow the lead of the
Senate committee. ...
City Assemblymen Are' Silent.
It is the proper thing, of course, to ">
pear before a 4egislative committee . ..d
protest against objectionable legislation,
but in the city's case the delegation might
Just as well have stayed away. When
the Legislature can draw blood from the
State's metropolis it Is a time for rejoic
ing, but when it can do that and at the
same time win a smile from the Governor
it is good cause for a general Jubilee.
Tfcat is what is happening now. and
through it all, out of the eighteen Assem
blymen and the nine Senators from San
Francisco there ia not one to raise his
voice in support of the visiting delega
tions.
The three measures of the Governor
have been thrown into the Legislature
like a gauntlet into the lists. Gage believes
he has the men to pass them, and he is
going to make the attempt. He has forty
two votes in the Assembly and the claim
is made that twenty-four more wait in
the Senate, with a possible thirty to guard
against absentees, junkets and weak
knees. The bills 'are filled with those
generalities that bring them within the
words of the Constitution, but carry noth
ing of its spirit.
In 1SS3 JoO.OOO was appropriated by the
State to keep vagrant bacilli of cholera,
then knocking at the door of New York,
from crossing the State line. From then
until last year $13,000 was spent In vari
ous ways, and then the annual expendi
ture jumped from $2100 to $9000. There is
still $28,000 of the $50,000 left, and the nat
ural demand for the reason this should
bo increased to $12S,000 is still unanswered.
That $100,000 bill will meet a warm re
ception in the Senate, but unless there Is
a general snapping of bonds and breaking
of shackles it will pass, and if ink holds
out it will be signed.
Before the Assembly Judiciary Commit
tee on Friday night, doctors were plied
with legal questions, and lawyers were
required to discuss' anatomy. Each gen
tleman who spoke was personally thanked
by the chairman with the mock sincerity
of a parent addressing a child. The
speakers said they wished to take up as
little time as possible, and they were
told that they committee's time was all
theirs, but with an inflection suggesting
that it was expected most of It would be
returned in good condition and unused.
The country members not under *the
gubernatorial spell, believe it is a good
thing for the State to look after the city's
health, and they lay aside their appre
hension over the possible passage of the
meadow lark bill long enough to hit the
city with the legal club which fortune has
placed In their hands.
Fight Over Franchise Bill.
To-morrow the Broughton franchise bill,
now in the Senate, will come out of com
mittee, the report depending upon the
vote, of Ashe. The Committee on Munici
pal Corporations is composed of Taylor
(chairman). Shortridge, Caldwell, Smith
of Los Angeles. Devlin, Tyrrell of San
Francisco and Ashe. As the committee
Is lined up now it is three to three. Short
ridge, Devnn and Tyrrell on one side, and
Smith, Caldwell and Taylor on the other,
with Ashe yet to vote. When the bill was
taken up last week, Ashe was away and
there was an attempt to take a vote Upon
it, or upon the amendments offered, which
make thq real question to be solved. The
two amendments under discussion knock
out the clause allowing bidders to bid
against the highest sealed bid after it
has been opened, and provide for the
granting of franchises upon petition of
owners of a certain percentage of the
property fronting on the proposed way,
without advertising or inviting competi
tion.
The proponents of the amendments
seem not to be active in their support, and
their expectations are not. the most rose
ate.- They. arrived late and found senti
ment crystallized. The. bill, had'; been
thrashed out in the Assembly;*:and'bolh
the amendments now proposed were al
lowed to be passed by. There was no
fight made for them, and the Impression
then given was that neither was consid
ered of first importance. What caused
the revulsion of feeling when ' the bill
reached the Senate Is a matter for specu
lation, answered by people from the south
with the explanation that the traction
company, believing It had control of the
City Council of Los Angeles, thought-it
could get what it wanted anyway, bill or
no bill, and, meeting unexpected failure
in that direction, hurried to Sacramento:
to have the bill amended with provisions
favorable to Itself. Should either of the
proposed amendments be adopted' by the
Senate, there is no doubt that the" bill'
will be hung up In the Assembly; and,'
In the absence of Joint "rules, this will
kill it. The traction people eay . they
don't care; that : they -would rather see
the bill dead than" passed without the
amendments. While that may be true,;
so far as the company is concerned, It
does not apply to the. Senate. It Is under-;
stood that several of the Senators who
are in favor of the amendments will vote
for the bill anyway, even should â¢ ' the
amendments fail, and in that case there
is little doubt of its passage.
Apportionment Problems.
'Apportionment, the enly other piece, of
legislation that is attracting more than
passing interest. Is turning on the three
Assemblymen from Sacramento. Not that
any of the surrounding counties care par
ticularly how many Assemblymen comÂ©
fro- cramento, but they figure it is
be ake Sacramento fight, and there
by the danger to themselves. ;
I 'ved by many that Sacramento
has he victim of its friends, and
that -..<_ of the Assemblymen has been
taken from it in order to raise a row.
Then, In the general confusion, it may bV
that the whole or a good part of the ap
portionment scheme may fall through.
The scheme to take an Assemblyman from 1
Sacramento came from the apiJortlonment
committee and was dropped. into Cutter's
bill as a committee amendment. Had the
rule regarding unlimited free conferences
been adoDted the bill might have been
hung up between the two houses In free
conference committee after free confer
ence committee, but under existing cir
cumstances that Is imoosslble. : i
The session Is half over, and bo far there
has not been one important piece of legis
lation. Both houses have refused to work
on Saturdays, and both have endangered
their quorums until authors of important
measures prefer to let them go to the foot
of the fl!e rather than stand a vote that
must be practically unanimous. Itihas
been the greatest Legislature for Junket-J
that has been seen In a long time,- and tho
effect of It all will be to cause a rush
toward the close.
The code bills have not been touched in
either house. The committees have re-
It was in August, 1SS3, that Mrs. May
brick, who came of a good Alabama fam
ily, was found guilty of poisoning her
husband by means of arsenic. It was
shown that Mr. Maybrick had been in the
habit of taking arsenic for threee or four
years -previous to his death, and physi
cians pronounced his death as due rather
to Inflammation of the stomach than
poisoning. Mrs. Maybrick's purchase of
arsenicated fly-paper was explained on
the ground that she used arsenic in the
preparation of face washes.
Shortly after the conclusion of the
trial, which resulted in Mrs. Maybrick
being condemned to death, a sentence af *-
terward commuted to imprisonment fJr
life, Mr. Justice Stephens, who, far from
preserving the impartiality required of
an English Judge, had practically taken
up the charge for the prosecution in Hi*
charge, went insane, and it has been ar
gued that his conduct of the trial betray
ed evidence of failing Intellect.
Should the royal prerogative of pardon
now be exercised in Mrs. Maybrick's fa
vor, as indicated by the foregoing dis
patch, it will not be so much a
recognition of a miscarriage of Jus
tice as a recognition of the ef
forts which have been made in Mrs. May
brick's behalf by the United States Gov
ernment. It is generally understood that
President McKinley and Mr. Hay.
throueh Embassador .Choate. have asked
the English Government for the pardon
and release of Mrs. Maybrick without ref
erence to the question of her- guilt or
Innocence as an act of international
comity. .- . ;-.
Since the discovery last year of a
posthumous letter from Lord Russell of
jvillowen to Mrs. Maybrick. written in
18U5, and showing conclusively that that
eminent lawyer was convinced that his
client ought never to have been convict
ed, partisans of the prisoner of Ayles
bury have been spurred to fresh efTorta
in her behalf, and their hopes have

MRS. MAYBRICK
TO BE RELEASED
The Edmund is of 2314 tons re -ster. next
to the largest sailing vessel listed as on
the way to the Pacific Coast. When she
was purchased by her present owners ah- 1
tost 675,000 marks, or about $162 000.
The ehio will take on water and stores
here, and the tup a fresh supply of water
and stores as well as coal. Caotain Mc-
Coy expects to make San Francisco in
three or four days after leaving here.
Captain McCoy and his crew are of the
opinion that had the vessel bee.i left
much longer on the beach the sea would
have piled a dike of rocks and sand
around her which could not have been re
moved. The crew worked nierht and day
from the time the tug reached the ship
until phe was floated.
On the 16th of January the Edmund wa3
floated and a. diver was sent down to get
her hull into shape. He had two holes to
repair and innumerable plugs to drive into
the rivet holes, until finally the incoming
water could be kept down with one pump.
Ballast was taken on to tne amount of
3500 tons, and on the 2d she started north
In tow of the tug. On the trip up strong
head winds were encountered, and there
was not a mile of the way that the haw
ser was not under strain.
When the tuc arrived the ship was full
of water. The powerful pumps which the
iup had taken down were rigped and the
w;iter was pumped out. so that the bal
last could be removed. During the time
the ballast was being removed there were
several days when it was found toecesarv
to permit the water to run back into the
hull, so that the ship might not be racked,
to pieces by the wind and waves. Thus
the vessel had to be pumped out nine dif
ferent times.
The Edmund, which formerly was the
British ship William Tell, built t.t Lelth,
Fcotland, had come to Santa Rosalia with
.VM tons of coke. After discharging- her
oargo of coke the sh:D took on ballast
and started for Portland, Oreeon. The
wind was liglu and the currents strong,
and the result was that the vessel landed
up against the bar at the south of the
harbor, where she stuck hard and fast.

WHEAT SHORTAGE IN

Mills May Have to Close Until ths
Harvesting of thÂ« New
Crop.
TACOMA. Feb. 10.â Reports from East
ern Washington grain districts show that
the warehouses there now contain the
smallest amount of wheat they have ever
held at thl3 season. Last fall they con
tained the entire crop of 19C0, besides con
siderable grain left over from the previous
two years. Ninety per cent of this total
has now been shipped.
Millers of interior towns have not fully
realized that a shortage existed unti> the
last few days. It is apparent that many
of them must close their mills before tho
new crop is harvested. Wheat is now
bringing 1 40 cents a bushel, with but few
sales. A rush to sell Is expected before
March 1, as the farmers will have to pay
taxes on all wheat then held.

The authorities say the shoes of two of
the men under arrest fit exactly the tracks

They carried ,the safe a distance of
about two blocks and then loaded it into
a wagon which toad been left there in
waiting. The wagon was driven about a
mile and a half out into the country and
there the safe was forced open and the
contents abstracted. 'The men there aban
doned the safe and went their way on a
new track. . It was not difficult to trace
them, however,- and this morning three ar
rests were made, v .
Thero was great excitement and no time
was lost in spreading the alarm. City
Marshal Ferrall hastily assembled a
posse. Snow lay deep on the ground and
it did not take long to discover the tracks
of two persons who â¢ evidently had been
carrying some heavy object directly from
the truck as it stood on tho depot plat

The express safe, with other articles, was
placed on a truck on the depot platform
and then Sturtevant and the baggageman
went to the other end of the platform to
get another truckload. When Sturtevant
returned he noticed that the arlcles on tho
truck were disarranged and a glance
showed that the iron box was gone.
While the robbery undoubtedly was de
liberately planned, as the horse and wag
on were in waiting at a convenient spot,
it is not believed that the men. knew they
were making so rich a haul. They had
no means of knowing the contents of the
safe, only that it was used in carrying
valuables.

DTTKE OF MANCHESTEB
OBJECTS TO NICKNAMES
Says His Wife Does Not Call Him
Gracey or Billy and Announces
Real Name.
DENVER, Feb. 10.â "I wish people
would stop calling me nicknames." said
the Duke of Manchester to-night. "My
wife does not call me Gracey, or Billy
either. My friends call me 'Kim,' which
is short for Kimbolton Castle, one of my
places, a sort of nickname. My Christian
names are Williams-Angus Drogo, and
Montague Is the family name. That story
about *ny wife calling me 'Gracey' conies
from the days when I was a reporter on
a New York paper. The New York re
porters showed remarkable inventive tal
ent in getting up nicknames for me. They
called me 'Your Grace" and 'Gracey,'
'your Royal Highness,' 'your Joblots.'
'Duke Billy,' 'Monty,' 'my Lord,' 'your
Highness,' 'Mr. Montagu.' 'his Jags,'
'Manch.' 'your Serene Highness,' and
about a dozen other names of the same
sort. I was on the pay roll as Manches
ter. I wish people would call me that."
The subject of names was brought up by
a question put to Eugene Zimmerman, the
Duke's millionaire father-in-law. When
asked last night what the Duke's first
name was, Mr. Zimmerman scratched his
head, looked puzzled and said "Damflno.
I'll ask him to-morrow."

of one week. The doctor is quoted as fol
lows: â¢..;,: -v*
"My treatment consists of Introducing
into the system a chemical or combination
of chemicals. This combination thorough
ly saturates the system and by reason of
its irresistible power, destroys the bacilli
without Injuring the tissue cells. It Is
administered in three ways, through the
mouth, hypodermically and In vapor form.
When the vapor Is used, the patient In
hales from three to fifteen minutes while
seated In a specially equipped steel cabi
net. Personally. I prefer the vapor, aa
It goes deep Into the lungs and reaches
the diseased parts. To effect a cure re
quires all the- way from twelve to sixteen
weeks of treatment, according to the re
sistance of the disease and the recuperat
ing physical condition of the patient."

NEW TORK, Feb. 10.â William A. Eddy,
at Bayonne, N. J M to-day completed In a
measure his tests of the reflecting power
of mirror sunflashes as compared with
eunlit and cloud-shaded snow. As a resu Â¦
of to-day's experiments Mr. Eddy foun
that mirror sunflashes were about fourteen
times as bright as cloud-shaded snow and
eight times as bright as sunlit snow. Pre
vious experiments showed that sunlit
snow was only about twice as bright as
snow shadowed- by clouds of ordinary
density. Mr. Eddy considers these experi
ments important in that they bear upon
the visibility of army signals from snow
capped mountain peaks.
The test of the relative lighting powers
was made by taking a sixteen candle
powec oil lamp held close to a sheet of
paper, the center of which had been made
semi-transparent by oil. The test was to
see how near or far the lamp had to be
held to the paper before its yellow glare
was effaced by the white glare caused by
the sunlit snow outside.
Mr. Eddy thinks from these experiments
that it Is highly probable that the light
flash said to have been seen from Mars at
Flagstaff. Ariz., could have resulted from
the sudden lighting up with sunrays of
snow which had been previously cloud
shadowed.
He calculated that, supposing the Mar
tians to be using mirrors to reflect the
light. It would be a stupendous undertak
ing to effect the result described. It
would require mirrors, he calculated, cov
ering more. than 100 square miles to po
duce the shaft of light.

Close Contest.
The brilliant sky and calm atmosphere
yesterday attracted many golfers out to
the Presidio links. Owing to the recent
.heavy rains the course and putting greens
were somewhat slow, bo that there was
but little roll to the ball. The most Inter

professional, representing the Oakland
Golf Club. It was the first half of a

holes. The first thirty-six holes* were
played yesterday, eighteen in the morning
and eighteen In the afternoon. After a
close strupKle the San Francisco men won,
two up. The lemaining thirty-six holes
will be played next Sunday on the Point
Adams links. The professionals hardly
did themselves justice, appearing to be
somewhat nervous.
Several practice matches were " played
during the day. C. F. Mullins beat J. S.
Severance two up; H. C. Golcher beat C.
E. Oliver four up on thirty-six holes; L.
O. Kellogg beat Hugh Tevis one up on

the Queen" to the same Invocation, on be
half of the King, was written by no one
knows exactly whom, although It Is cred
ited to a certain Dr. John Bullâappropri
ate nameâ who lived in the early part of
the eighteenth century. Its first printed
form, of date 1742, commences:
God save our Lord the King!
Long live our noble King',
God save the King!
But a few years later it appeared as:
â¢ God save Great George, our King!
Long live our noble King!
God save the King!
According to the New York Tribune, the
poet Longfellow wrote a new stanza,
which. Indeed, reads prettily:-
Ixird, let war's tempests cease,'
Fold the whole world in peace
Under Thy Wings.
Make all the nations one.
All hearts beneath the sun.
Till Thou Shalt reign alone.
Great King ot Kings'
This verse, however, did not stick.
Neither did Dean Hole's amendment,
which was to supplant the words "con
found their politics, frustrate their knav
ish tricks," which was framed thus: g
Keep : us from plague and dearth,
Turn thou our woes to mirth,
And over nil the earth
Let there be peace! ,,
The people are too much attached to the
old form.. The New .York Tribune asks
why not revive the "God -Save the King"
that was used when Edward VI came to
the throne. \ That version begins In this
way: - Â¦ -
King Edward, Kins Edward, :
God save King Edward,
King Edward the Sixth!
But It is difficult to see how these words
could be forced to fit the tune. â Toronto

Justice McClellan of the Alabama Su
preme Court was shot in the right should
er at his house this morning by either
Jesse D. Beale or- his son, Phelan Beale,
of this city. The wound is a serious one.
It Is alleged that the Beales wenf'to the
house of Judge McClellan to find John
McQueen of Birmingham, assistant solic
itor of Jefferson County, whom, the elder
Beale charged with abducting- his daugh
ter Caroline.
It is alleged Miss Beale had not been at
home all night, and they had been in
formed that McQueen had been riding
about in a hack with her. Judge McClel
lan attempted to prevent the Beales from
going through Ills house in their hunt for
McQueen. This they resented, and one of
them, believed to be the father, shot Me-
Clellan with a pistol.
The Beales xÂ«'irsued their hunt, and be
lieving they had located McQueen in a
closet; which was locked, fired about a
dozen shots through the door. McQueen
was in the closet, but was in a narrow
place to the sldo of the door and Â¦was not
struck by any of the balls. The Beales
were arrested find held without bail.
Later the fact was developed that Mc-
Queen and Miss Beale had gone to the
residence of Probate Judge Gaston after
midnight to secure a license to marry but
the Judge declined to issue a license un
der the circumstances. As soon as the
facts became known the Beales were
reconciled to- the match and the young
people were married. .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL- BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â Now that
the report of the Congressional committee
which investigated hazing at West Point
has been made public, 1 Secretary Root
expected to give to the press this week
the report of the military court of in
quiry which conducted a similar investi
gation.
The report of the Congressional com
mittee is much more scathing in its con
demnation of practices which prevailed
at the military academy than is that of
the military court. The latter stat-es ex
plicitly that the death of Cadets Booz
and Brett was not due to ill treatment
sustained at the academy. The Con
gressional committee failed to definitely
establish this point, though jt stated that
"we cannot affirmatively find that their
death was caused by this treatment."
The report of the military court found
that hazing existed at the academy, but
It specifically stated that it was less bru
tal than the practice observed at civil
educational institutions. The board se
verely condemned hazing, and recom
mended more stringent disciplinary meas
ures. No action was taken by the War
Department against any of the cadets for
the reason that In many cases the stat
ute of limitations applied, and in others
cadets involved gave testimony with the
understanding that they should not be
punished. Department officials and army
officers are confident that the voluntary
agreement made by the cadets to abandon
hazing will stop it more effectually than
the enforcement of any regulations or
laws.

has come from the Cuban Constitutional
Convention, directly or Indirectly, to
broad hints thrown out by the administra
tion that the constitution must recognize
the right of the United States to intervene
In Cuba's forelsn affairs.
Prominent residents of Cuba who accom
panied the Cuban commercial commmlttee
to this city have informed the Senators
that they do not expect the convention Vi
make their constitution satlsfacory to the
United States. The President woes not re
gard matters as clearing up and he is
still seriously calling the attention of
members of Congress to the necessity for
an extra session.
An important matter bearing upon the
right of the United States to insist upon
this recognition of guardianship from
Cuba was pointed out to-day. It has been
asserted that Congress In the resolution
approved on April 21," 1S08, precluded the
possibility of interfering with or hamper
ing the sovereignty of the republic of
Cuba. It Is held that this resolution Is
superseded by the treatv of 1 Paris. In
which the United States bound itself to do
this very thing.

"WASHINGTON', Feb. 10.â If considera
tion of thÂ« naval appropriation, bill Is
completed during Monday, as is Euppcsed
It will be. the ship subsidy bill wlU be
railed up by Senator Frye and that bill
will continue to receive the attention of
the Senate during the remainder of the
day. Senaf Â»r Caffery will take the floor
when the bill Is taken up and Is expected
to make a lengthy argument- Senator
Procter ha? given notice that as chairman
of the Committee on Agriculture he will
ra.!l \ip the agricultural bill on Tuesday.
There w!jl be. no effort to prevent the dis
placement of the subsidy bill oy the ap
propriation. The Committee on Appro
rriatlor.s hopes to be able to report the
fortifications appropriation bill by the
time the agricultural bill shall he dis
posed of and the army appropriation bill
;s expected to be reported later In the
we^k.
The plan is to have all appropriation
Wlls acted on as promptly as possible
efter they are reported, but when there
â¢ re r.o bills of that "cnaracter before the
Senate the subsidy bill will continue to
have the right of way. The Indications
ure that there will be no further imme
diate attempt to hold right sessions. The
' pponents of the subsidy bill declare that
in case of a renewal of the night meetings
the friends of the bill will be compelled
-to keep constantly !n the chamber a quo
rum of their own.
While they made frequent demands for
a call of the Senate during the evening
sessions of last week, they always them
selves replied to their names when called.
It is now understood to be their purpose
rot to do this in case of further efforts
to bring the bill to a vote: by carrying
the Senate meetings into the night.
Much interest is felt in the effort which
Is to be made to secure legislation in con
nection with the army appropriation bill
in regard to the Philippines and Cuba. It
has always been supposed that any at
tempt in either diiection would open up
the entire colonial policy of the adminis
tration and lead to interminable debate,
but there l.Â« now unquestionably quite "a
general acquiescence in the effort to be
made for Philippine and Cuban legisla
tion.
A majority at least of the Democrats
prem willing that a vote should be reached
on both these provisions. Indeed, it is
understood to be the position of Senator
Jones of Arkansas and of his immediate
supporters in opposition to the subsidy bill
that there will be no obstacle to getting
Â« vote upon any bill before the Senate
except the ship bill, and possibly the oleo
margarine bill.
In all probability, however, the Cuban
and Philippine questions will be discussed
p.t considerable length and even though
there may be no desire to defeat them
they may be used to hold off the subsidy
bill.
The Committee on the Philippines will
hold a meeting Monday and it is expected
will agree promptly upon a favorable re
port upon the Philippine amendment, but
the Question will probably not be taken
up in the Senate until the army appropria
tion bill shall be reported. "The Cuban
Committee will meet later in the week.
The revenue reduction bill will come be
fore the House to-morrow with ?ome pros
pert of an animated discussion. The Ways |
and Means Committee has already deter
mined on a recommendation for a disa
creement to the Senate amendments to
The bill and the conference with the Sen
ate will be asked. But this determination
has aroused considerable feeling among
the majority members of the committee,
ar.d this may find expression when Chair
man Payne presents the report and moves
for a conference. Following this matter
the diplomatic and consular appropriation
hill will claim attention, the general dis
cussion of foreign questions, particularly
the Philippines, being still open. The army
appropriation bill and the sundry civil
bill also â¢will receive consideration during
this week. Among the measures of gen
eral legislation likely to come up is the
important bill for Government aid and
participation in the Louisiana purchase
exposition to be hold at St. Louis. Chair
man Tawney, having the subject in
Â«-hanre. has received assurances from the
Speaker of early recognition and expects
to take up the bill during the first part
of the week. The bill retiring- officers of
revenue cutter service and establishing a
standardizing bureau continues to be spe
rial orders when appropriations bills do
net have the right of way. Legislation
regarding West Point hazing may come
up at ar.v time, although it Is likely to be
dealt with in conference in connection
with the Military Academy appropriation
bill.

Miss Leeton says she was taking her
dinner in a restaurant, when a friend
of Senator Sullivan called her outside,
ostensibly tp give her a letter. She says
the Senator was waiting, and asked her
to walk up the street with him. She did
so, and after they had talked for some

face three times.

Kress expects to have his vessel ready for trial in
the spring, and. Count Zeppelin also intends to. make
another attempt at that season. -Flying ship trials are
therefore likely td be among the' amusements of the
arid'perhaps something may be achieved
of practical value' to the world.
From Vienna comes the report that there are grc?.t
expectations in that cily of a flying ship devised by
Wilhelm Kress, whose work has been promoted by
liberal contributions from the Emperor and many 01
the nobility. His vessel is to be sustained by wing?
composed of silk and extended by steel ribs. The ma
chine is to be raised and moved by two propellers
similar to a ship's screws. These while propelling the
vessel will make the wings or sails face the air. With
these latter, or part df them, directed upward, a power
will come into action which will first support the
weight of the. boat and then, raise it in the air as it
grows stronger. The screws are to be set in' motion
by a benzine motor of .'twenty-horstpower, and-of
such exceeding lightness as has never been â¢ before
.constructed. It is believed that it will not weigh more
than from eight to ten kilograms per horsepower, and
it will be. made of aluminum. . Â¦ . .
It will be remembered that in the annual report of
the United States; Board of Ordnance an'd Fortifica
tion, made public just before the holidays, there was a
reference to .tests made with the flying machine of
Professor Lang-ley of the Smithsonian Institution. It
appears, therefore, that enough has been accomplished
by Langley ,to make it worth while for the.Govern
ment to give, attention to the possible'use of his in
vention a$'a?vveapon .of war. According to a recent
description Langley's latest machine is built of alumi
num, twcuty-five-feet long, six feet wide and eight feet
deep. It is operated. by a. twenty-horsepower liquid-air
engine, weighing only'fbrty-sevcn pounds. On cither
side of the ship are sails or wings, twenty- four feet in
width, supposed to represent the form of an albatross'
wing. Slightly abaft midships are paddle-wheels, five
feet six inches in diameter, capable of making two
thousand revolutions a minute., , â¢ -.
SINCE Count Zeppelin's recent experiments with
the great airship, he has constructed at Lake
Constance comparatively little attention; .has
been given in the news. of the' day concerning progress
made in the direction of solving' the problems of aerial
navigation. TJic work is going steadily forward, how
ever, and it is even probable that other experimenters
may attaiu success before Zeppelin gets his ship 'into
shape for practical use. . ' . ' . , '

We have no doubt that to diplomatists, to those
learned in the lore of the College of Heralds; and to
others whose minds are susceptible to the influence
of titles, the proclamation will be a matter of impor
tance. It is doubtful,'howeyer, whether the care dis:
played in selecting the title under which Edward
claims rule <5vcr the Transvaal will strike the Boers
any more impressively than it strikes . the average
American. To accept Edward as "Supreme-Lord. of
and over the Transvaal" would be to surrender every
vestige of the kind of independence the Boers are
fighting lor. They desire no part or parcel with either
the empire or its royalty, and although high diplo
matic authorities assure them .that the proclamation
means they arc to be a "separate constituent of the
empire" and a "distinct political entity in the aggre-
kingdoms, states, .colonies, >etc., ( which awe

In fact, Edward's chance of getting into power over
â¢the slender wire of a diplomatic phrase is slight. The
'attempt to do so recalls the fact that when he visited.
America in the days of his youth a tight rope per

him to make his entry into the United States in spec

In this connection it is worth noting there is an
other and much more sensible 'scheme under consid

The London Chronicle recently put forth .a sugges

South Africa to negotiate with the .Boers-, and isaid:
"The famous French Canadian is loyal; above sus

when Edward was proclaimed by Lord Kit
chener at Pretoria, not as King, nor as Em
peror, but as "Supreme Lord of and over the Trans
vaal," the title given was designed as an assurance to
the Boers that the Transvaal is not to be annexed as
a crown colony subject to tne King and the Parlia
ment of Great Britain, but is to be a self-governing
state under the lordship of the King.
DIPLOMACY IN ' THE TRANSVAAL
The season continues propitious. The rainfall could
not have been better distributed, and periodical frosts
have kept the buds :n check and given the growing
grain stronger roots. Everywhere the prospects arc
reported excellent. With the usual spring rains from
row on we ought to harvest" good crops of every
tl'ire.
Beyond this advance in wine the commercial situa
tion here was tame enough. There were the usual
iluctuations in produce and groceries, and the appear
ance of a little nibbling demand for prunes led to the
faint hope that it might be the beginning of the spring
call for this fruit. The cattle and sheep market fell
off a little, as the quotations have lately been too high
for the public purse.
Our local markets exhibited no features calling for
extended mention. The price of wine was again ad
vanced, the rise being 2]4 cents per gallon for the
raw wine. This makes the quotation 2-,Vi . cents,
which is about double what wine brought four or
five years ago. The local wine men sav that the ad
vance is permanent, owing to depleted stocks, a grow
ing demand for our wine and- the ravages of the
phylloxera, which are cutting down the vineyard, aicu
Â»>f- the State. They further. say that; grapes will
Kond property again for several vintages to come.
Ergo, every farmer will probably rush into grapcÂ«,
and in a few years the old story will be repeated.'
There is nothing new in Wall street worthy of
note. The market continued active, and both profes
sionals and the public dealt freely, while London did
considerable buying.
Reports from the different sections of the country,
however, are encouraging, especial!}- from the two
s-cctions just mentioned and the Northwest. A better
demand for spring goods is reported, and even winter
goods, such as boots ;md shoes andclothing, are sell
ing very well. The leather market is also looking up,
and hides are steadier in sympathy. Lumber is quieter.
Cotton and wool and their fabrics are reported quier
end not materially changed. The iron and steel trader
remain as for some weeks, featureless, but generally
on a steady basis. The grain markets have ruled un
:-crtied during the week, a^d wheat has declined under
a bearish , situation in the argentine. These points
about cover the main features of business throughout
the country during the past week.
TRADE all over the country is characterized by
midwinter dullness. True, the bank clearings
show a gain, over last year of 26.1 per cent, but
this does not necessarilj r imply that business is livelj'.
In fact, except on the Pacific Coast and in the Gulf
State?, where there is neither sno.v nor ice to interfere
with trade, there is always a lull during the months
of January and February, and this year is no ex
ception.
THE MIDWINTER LUlL.
QUEEN VICTORIA'S FULL NAME
TV. A. R., City. A history of the late Queen
Victoria has the following about her
name: -
There w/19 some little trouble obout finding
a name for the baby. The father wished to
call her Elizabeth, thinking that from its glo
rious traditions that would prove a name to
please the people should she occupy thÂ« throne.
But the prince resent, who was godfather, to-
Rether with the Emperor of. Russia, (rave only
tho name of Alexandrina to the clergy. Tho
father pleaded that another name be added
and propwfd that of the regent's .own name,
Oeorgina. but the regent jiald that that name
could not come in the second place and as the
Emperor's must take precedence. If the baby
had to have another name plve her her moth
er's", so the -princess came to be called Alex
andrina Victoria, and in infancy she wan
known a'a Princess Drina, a name she dropped
after ' her accession.
~ The â¢ family name of the late Queen, if
it can properly be said she had one. was
Guelph of Welf. Upon this point the fol
lowlnp from the Whitehall Review throw-3
some light:
.. At dinner the other n'.eht a celebrated hls
, torian was present and I put a question to
him which I know has. puzzled a great many
people at different time*: "What is the iur
name. of tho royal family?" ."Ouelph of
course." That- Is the usual answer, and It was
the historian's. I ventured to sutrsest that al
though' the members of .the royal family arc
Giielphs. by ' descent. Her . Majesty's marriage
with Prince. Albert of Saxe-Cohurjr must have
had the effect which the â¢ marriage* of a lady
has In all other cases, and that the surname
, of tho present house must be the Prince Con
; sort's. But what Is the surname of the Prince
' Consort's family? Simple, but staggering
; Wettin. Every ono smiled at the horrible
Idea of the Guelphs being reduced to Wet
, tins. The point . was referred to Theodore
, Martin. "Tou are quite right" said the grace
ful WoKrapher of the. Prince Consort. "Wet
,!tln is. the family namÂ« of the house of Sax
ony, to whom the dominion of -Saxony pawed
.in 1420... The, King of Saxony and thÂ«. minor
princes ' ire, therefore, all Wettins. or Ger
man 'We-tUner."
Royal families droV their family names
nnd cannot in reality be said to have an v
They are known only by their titles. In
that case the -late Quern's full name was
Alexandria Victoria, but if we take It
in the "rdlnary sense, her; full. name was
Alexandrina \ictorla Guelph .Wettln.

ROTATION OF THE MOONâ L. M. S..
Oakland, Cal. The reason the inhabitants
of the earth have never seen but one side
of the moon .is because that; luminary
makes a revolution on her axis in the
same time that she revolves around the
earth, and so always presents the same
face to us. The reason for this peculiar
ity, astronomers say. is the ellptical form
of the moon itself. It is not probable that
the moon originally started on her axial
rotation with precisely the same velocity
with which she moved around the earth,
but it is thought that the two motions
were originally not very, far apart, and
Jhe fact that the attraction of the earth
slightly elongated the lunar globe served
to draw the axial rotation in a period of
time toward the" orbital movement around
the eartR. Now, therefore, they so nearly
correspond that if the orbital movement
varies the other will ' undoubtedly vary
â¢with it. and thus the exact correspond
ence will bo indefinitely kept up.
DOGDAYS-I,. M. S.. Oakland. Ca!. The
name dogdays is applied to that time of
the year, when Sirus â known as the dofi
star, because It is in the constellation of
Canis Majorâ the brightest fixed star in
the northern hemisphere, rises for several
successive weeks at nearly the same time
as does the sun. The ancients regarded
the conjunctlpn of the rising of this star
with the rising of the sun as the cause for
the great heat at that period of the year,
which is some time during the. months of
July and August. As, however, this con
junction of the sun and star does not oc
cur at the same time in all latitudes, and
is not constant in the same region for a
long period, there has been much varia
tion in calendars respecting the time of
the dogdays. Furthermore this rising be
came later and later in all latitudes, owing
to precession. The beginning of these days
has been variously fixed . by almanac
makers from July 3 to 26. and their, close
from Aueust 11 to September 7.

So the bright views of last fall are rapidly dissolving.
Fortunately the welfare of the country is not wholly
dependent upon Congressional action. We can wait
for the canal, the merchant marine bill, the reduction
of taxes and big appropriations. There will be, oi
course, disappointments, but the people, will take
courage. A new Congress has been elected, and in thy
knowledge of that fact hope can renew her youth and
expectation once more take on a sanguine hue.
._ Finally, there is the rrver and harbor biil, from which
so many constituencies; expected great things. It is the
richest "bill of the kind on 'recordâ veritable plum
pudding. The House 7 put into, it appropriations
enough to make a total of about $69,000,000, and the
Senate raised the amount to nearly $80,000,000. In its
present shape it appears ; t<> be too. rich for/ the admin
istration. There is a rumor that if sent to the Presi
denth he would veto it. Senate committee is, at
work taking out some of the plums and reducing the
suet. Perhaps they will get it into digestible.condi
tion, but the chances are slim. '.*-" ' >
Next in order is the- bill for the' reduction oi
war revenues. The 1 eduction was promised* in th4
Republican platform. It was recommended by tho
Secretary of the Treasury and by thePresident. \ The
House promptly adopted: the: bill providing for if:.
The Senate took thebilUand struck out nearly every
line of it,- sending back.'to 'the*;Hoiise- a virtually new
measure. Now the origination- of revenue bills is a
prerogative of the House, and it.is believed the mem
bers of that body will resent the action of the. Senate
in destroying the House biil and making a new one.
So there is 'every prospect of a deadlock on that issue,
and tax reduction will probably be among the things
for w.hich we shall have to wait.'
There were sanguine expectations of the passage of
the shipping bill for the. upbuilding of the American
merchant, marine, but. there has been" displayed such!
an antagonism toward ; the,,'mcasure it is -.'extremelyj
doubtful if it can be carried in the few weeks that re-j

SOCIETY: WHO GAVE AWAY THE ENGAGEMENT SECRET?
With these instances so fresh in our home history it
is not surprising that similar conditions have caused
their appearance in the midst of the turmoil and ten
sity of a tropical war, carried on at the antipodes.
The problem in Manila is what to. do with the plan
ners and beneficiaries of the scheme. That will largely
depend upon the decision of the Supreme Court upon
the issues now before it in the Porto Rico and Philip
pine cases. If the decision be that the islands are
under the constitution then military arrest and .trial
of civilians must cease. They are amenable to the
civil law only. It is doubtful too if they can. be ar
raigned on the grave charge of treason. Congress
has never declared war against the Filipinos. In the
constitutional sense there is no war in the islands and;
therefore,, no public enemies. The army is there on
police duty only. The situation has its counterpart in
our Indian uprisings. The frontier traders always
have communicated with the Indians, and traffic with
them has been but little interrupted by hostilities.
When Sitting Bull's band left the Sioux reservation
they were unarmed. When Custer met them -on the
Little Rosebud they were equipped with Winchesters,
navy revolvers and knives! His carelessness in their
pursuit was due to the belief that they were without
arms. Between the time of their escape from tha
reservation and the massacre of Custer's force their
arms were sold to them by *a trader who afterward
became a United States Senator.
During our Civil War this Manila method had its
counterpart along the military frontier. The North
ern trader wanted cotton, and the Southern trader
wanted quinine and saltpeter/. In spite of all military
vigilance the two classes managed to get together,
and cotton found its way behind the Union lines and
what the South needed in exchange crossed the Con
federate lines. In that time; the papers were full of
charges that high military officers were concerned in
this illicit traffic, and in a percentage of cases this was
no doubt true. War is a demoralizing agency. Its
tendency to destroy the conscience and debauch the
principles of men increases in the ratio of. the distance
of its theater from the home center and the base of
civil oversight and public opinion.
By means of this system the produce of the interior
enters commerce and its value goes back. in exchange.
Kven arms and ammunition are sent to the hostile
camps. The active agents in this scheme are Ameri
cans who appear to have Spanish partners, and the
profitable business is operated under passes and per
mits issued unwittingly by the United States military
authorities. It is not a subject for special wonder
that this condition prevails in the islands. They are a
long distance away. The seat of final authority is so
far away that it is reached with difficulty, and such
local administration as the islands have at our hands
seems to be based upon cither hatred or contempt of
the native people. .
Chicago and New York
It is alleged that this system of communication Is
so perfect that through it the ordinary commercial and
financial operations are performed. Cargoes and in
voices of merchandise are transmitted, and the bills
of exchange follow the bill of lading with about the
same certainty as if the transaction , were, between
THE chronic afflictions of the -Philippine situation

"What do you think of our highballs?"
was the first question a yellow journalist
put to him yesterday.
"Highball." repeated Coquelln: "what is
a highball?" And then when it was ex
plained to the actor that a highball was
a drink of whisky and soda served in a
long glass he put his hand upon hl3 heart
and solemnly assured tne interviewer, in
classic French, that "never In his life,
upon his honor, had he tasted a. highball."
Then the yellow journalist graciously told
him he spoke "French very well and very
distinctly." and the actor, still with his
hand on his heart, explained that acting
was an art. and the first requisite of his
art was to speak distinctly.
Coquelln spent his first Sunday in town
qu.etly. He went around to the theater
and then returned home and passed the
day in reading.
'Madam Bernhart went out for a drive
in the afternoon. Before she got started
Madam Bernhardt is confident that
Americans do not know their Shakes
peare, and declares that- Is the reason
they would have none of her "Hamlet."
Monsieur' Coquelln also has his opinions
on Americans In regard to Shakespeare.
"When It comes to Shakespeare." says
the great French actor, "you Americans
are more royal than the King," more Eng
lish than the English. Shakespeare is sa
cred to you. You have your pronounced
ideas as to how a role should be treated,
and you not only will not tolerate a dif
ferent conception, but will not comÂ© to
Bee one." ' Â¦
When Coquelln. speaks of Rostand and.
of "Cyrano" he grows eloquent. His face
lights up and his voice takes on a tender
Â°"It Is the greatest play that ever was
written," said- Coquelln. "I never weary
of It The more I play it the more I love
It. I look upon "Cyrano" as the greatest
moral lesson the stage teaches. It teaches
a lesson on nobility of soul, courage and
the beauty of sacrifice."
Sarah Bernhardt can soeak a little Eng
lish but ehe declines to, for, she says,
"English will spoil my. accent, and when
I return to Paris they will say I have. an
American accent.','
did say that she did not consider the Pal
ace "anything to speak of much, and
that really It was ridiculous that they
would not let her have her dogs with her.
"I do not believe that San Francisco
hotel managers are well bred. ", she said.
â¢â¢j.ne first thingr a well bred pe*rson does Is
to be gracious to strangers. I do not call
it gracious to tell me that I may not have
my dogs with me. I am naturally timid
and am In the habit of havlntc a doe In
my room at night.
"What do you think of a hotel." said
Madam Sar^h. "that takes your doss from
you and does not even have a vase In
which you may arrange your flowers? But
then. I believe, this Is a strange town. I
bring my < own coachman with me. and
when I hire a carriage they will not per
mit him to drive. 'No,' says the carriage
company: 'your man cannot drive; our
man -must.' However," went on Madam
Sarah, "I shall have all that remedied to
morrow. 1 1 shall send word to the car
jiage company to this effect: 'If I smash
your carriage I shall pay for it: if I kill
one of your horses I* shall see that you
are duly recompensed.' "
When madam had finished her chapter
of woes she turned to her art.
"I have no I preference for any of the
parts that I play. I love -them all. If I
did not I would not play them. L'Alglon
Is one o{ the most fatiguing roles I play.
It is the longest I have ever played. To
play it I had my hair cut short. To wear
a wig through such a long, trying part
was too much of a strain. My hair is so
thick and curly that . you cannot tell
whether it Is long or short"
incidentally the Divine Sarah Declares That San Francisco Hotel Managers Are "Not Gen
tlemen" Because She May Not Have Her Dogs in Her Rooms.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 10.â George Dur

the land Jumpers prove as determined a3

Los Angeles four men accustomed to the
handling of firearms in any emergency,
and these men will proceed to-morrow
afternoon to Salton, there to hold the
fort against all comers. If it be found
these men are not enough others will be
engaged and the disputed salt fields will
be held at all hazards.
Hostilities may not break out at once.
Unless the land jumpers are cowed by
the Durbrow display of force. they un
doubtedly will- call for similar assistance,
and in that e\-ent there may be a minia

Plumber Frtirmuth Admits That He
Told a Serious Lie About .
His Competitor. /â¢; y
Charles Freirmuth, a plumber residing
at 1S79 Union street, appeared in a bad
light Saturday at the Inquest upor; the
body of Richard Schwartz, who died last
Tuesday night of a fractured skull. He
was obliged, when placed on the witness
stand, to admit that he had slandered
George P. Haub, a rival plumber at 1879
Union street.
Shortly after the death of Schwartz had
been reported to the police, Friermuth
circulated a story that he could produce
several witnesses to show that Haub had
struck Schwartz In the latter* s butcher
shop .at 19S7 Union street: that Schwartz
walked a block with blood streaming from
his head, and that he, Friermuth, knew
two men who had tracked the blood stajns
from Schwartz's shop to the place where
he fell unconscious. Detective Thomas
Gibson Interviewed Friermuth and wa.s
told the same story, but when he was
pressed for the names of his witnesses
Friermuth declined any further Informa
tion. On the stand yesterday Friermuth
admitted that there was no truth in the
story. Mr. Haub was not near the local
ity at the time and his frjends say that he
secured a eontract a short time ago that
Friermuth was bidding upon.
The testimony showed that Schwartz
fell in an apoplectic fit and struck the
back of his head heavily upon an iron
cesspool cover.

she had a lensthy interview with the car

ing, and In less than a half hour
the divine Sarah had changed her
hotel, developed a. grievance and decided
that San Francisco hotel managers were
not jfentlemen. And all this because of
two fox terriers cf no particular pedigree.
"You can't have thoso dogs In your
room, madame," said the manager of ihe
California Hotel. "It Is against the rnles

The divine Sarah said nary a â¢word. She
just rrabbed those dogs. Gathered up
her Fklrts and ordered her retinue to fol
low her to the Palace.
At the Palace it was the same story.
"No dogs allowed" is what they told the
ETeat actress, who, seeing there was
nothing else to be done, bowed to the
Inevitable and let her dogs be relegated
to the baggage-room. *
Marcus Mayer first told the story.
"It was terribly cad." said he. "There
were tears In Mme. Sarah's eyes. But
she is a philosopher, so she said nothing
and submitted. "
Mayer's voice trembled and there Is no
telllcp what might have happened If at
that moment he had not thought of the
dogs.

odds of fifteen, which proved to be a very
fair handicap. In the first set Cornell
had a lead of Z-4 and was within a point
of winning several times, but his morn
steady opponent, after some fast rallies,
took the set 7-5. Rosenberg seemed to
gain confidence in the second set. and af
ter having a lead of 5-2. finally won 6-4.-

younger opponent. The complete score

the first class winner, and Paul Jones,
the fourth class winner, was a surprise
to everybody, as Jones with a handicap
of thirty won in straight sets 6-3. 6-4.

this match, while Whitney was somewhat
off in his game;
The final rour.d ferousrht cut the best
tennis of the day. In this round Jones,
with odds of half thirty, was pitted
against Rosenberg, who won the match
through his superior head work and won
derful steadiness. Trie score in favor of
Rosenberg was 6-4. 4-6. 7-5. 6-4.

lets amount. Considerable money has also

Is between the promoters and the two tel
egraph companies. The former wanted
\zM for the telegraph privileges of Saen
gerfest Hall. The Western Union and the
Postal companies offered but $250 each, or
a total of JoOO. nnd rerted a buildlnir
across the street from Saengerfest Hall
for their offices. The leased wires of the
Associated Press and the leased wires of
the newspapers will be looped into the
hall, as they will not be affected by the
controversy. It Is believed, however, that
the matter will be compromised.
The contests cf next Friday night wore
to be preceded on Sunday hy an athlet'c
and musical entertainment In the remod
eled Saengerfest Hall. -'This took plnce
this afternoon, and it was a great suc
cess in attendance and otherwise. The
big hall was found to be in excellent con
dition.
The feature of the day was the speech
delivered by George F. Dieterle, one of
the leading members of the Saengerfest
Athlptic Association, who took occasion
to compliment Mayor Fleischmann for
his stand In favor of the Jeffrles-Ruhlln
contest. The audience rose en masse aiÂ»-l
gave threÂ« cheers for the Mayor, and the
demonstration continued for some time.
Uuhlin was Introduced, and received nn
ovaton. "Jeffries old not appear.
Meantime there Is much anxiety over
the decision of Judge Holllster and tho
action of Governor Nash. It will be known
within n day or two whether Judge Hol
listor grams a permanent injunction
against the contest on the ground of a
public nuisance, but the promoters do not
know what tho Governor may do or when
he will do it. Even after the fight begins
they do not know at what moment the
State forces may Interfere, ns three regi
ments of mllltln are said to be now under
marching orders.
They will know, however, on the day of
tho contest whether the troops, are here
or whether they are on the wny so as to
get hero In tttro to stop the contest.
While the Mayor with his permit prom
ised a force of police to maintain order, it
Is known that the police will not protecv
tho. event to t're extent of offering any
resistance to the mii.tln. There has been
much talk about the probability of a col
lision between ihe police nnd the militia,
but It la authoritatively announced that
there is not the remotest danger of any
thing of that nature occurring.
There hns been considerable talk about
postponing the contest. If Judge Hollls
ter allows tho injunction on Tuesday the
defendants will nt once appeal to the Cir
cuit Court, nnd If they lose In that Inter
mediate court they will carry the case to
the Supremo Court, which does not sit
again until February 19. If this course is
pursued the contest may be postponed
from one to two weeks. The promoters
do not want to postpone the date any
longer than possible. Tho expenses of the
training quarters are very heavy, and
CINCINNATI. Fob. 10. -Not withstand*
Ing th* court proceedings ami the attitude
of tlio Governor, this has boon u busy day
with the sporting men In Cincinnati. All
outward signs look like the eve of a groat
coming evÂ«nt with them. Manager Mad
don and Gus Tiuhlin wore busy with vis
itors Â«t tho Country Club early in the
day. Manager Hrndy, Kd Cook and oth
ers assisted Jeffries nnd Delanoy In en
tertatnlns at tliolr training quarters.
Many more called than could be admitted
at both places.
Tom Bharkey nnd Spider Kelly are hap
py over tholr prospects, ns they claim
Bharkey is to haxa the next chance, no
matter whether JcfTrlos or Kiihlin wins.
Bharkey will challenge the winner at tho
ringsM*\
All tho visiting and local sports are ex
pressing tholr opinions as to tho chances
of tho two big men. These opinions gen
erally pick Jeffries . as the winner, al
though all concede that Ruhlin Is In the
bettor condition. Some say that Huhlin
has beon nvortralncd.
Hoth will go 'hrouKh thÂ«Mr regular prac
tice Monday. They will slacken thÂ«Mr ex
erciso Tutsday and Ft 111 more on Wednes
day, doing little on Thursday. Tlu>y rest
all day Friday. As tho preliminary hout
between t" hilds and Martin for ten rounds
Is not to be railed until 3 p. m. Friday, It
may bo late when Joflfries and Huhlin en
ter the ring for their twenty rounds. '

The Gdldcn Gates and the Koenigs came
together yesterday afternoon on the Rec
reation grounds after three postponements
on account of wet weaiher. The former
team carried off the .fruits of victory, the
score being 6 to 5.
Perrine was rather an easy mark for
the batsmen of the "Straits." Hits were
bunched tri three innings with a result
that, enough men crosses the. rubber to
keep a steady lead. 'Only in the ninth was
the game in danger for the Golden Gates.
Then the Koenlgs scored three men and
approached tying distance.
The sensation of tho day Was the three
base hit of Brockhoff. This happened in
tho eighth. Brockhoft was so eager to
skate the bags that when he reached the
third station he fell in a dead falnti It
was some minutes before he revived, but.
contrary to the advice and expostulations
of his team mates. BrockhofT went Into
the field in the next inning. The score:

afternoon at Pythian Castle. .The meeting
was addressed by the following named
from other unions: Q.Barnaby, Barbers:
H. " Gallagher, Shoeworkers; N.Â« Blum
Cigarmakers, and A: E. Roe of the Re
tail Clerks, all of whom" promised sym
pathy and support. Delegates were chosen
to represent the union before other labo"
organizations. Tho question of early
closing ! was deferred. /.The main. purpose
of, the meeting, was to formulate a plan
against the ; Japanese, . who are . making
serious encroachments in this trade, but
nothing definite was decided upon. -
Menace of Japanese Cheap Labor.
The ladles who compose the board of
directors- and officers of . that deserving:
charity, tho Little Sisters* Infant Shel
ter, have arranged, for a rummage sale
to be 'held on the 14th. 15th .and 16th lnsts.,
at the corner' of Seventh and Minna
streets. The board has already i secured
some contributions for. this sale, but It
solicits the aid of the general public In
the way of donations Â¦ of discarded gar
ments, underwear,- shoes, boots, hats,
gloves, kitchen utensils, furniture, pro
visions and in fact anything and every
thing that will be- salable. ;
This will benefit both the Institution,
which now has a large number of little

CAR KILLS HIM
WHILE AT WORK
Track Repairer Is Horribly
fj Mangled on Folsom
Street.
Dominick Lertnon, a track repairer, was
knocked down and horribly mangled yes
terday morning by an electric car of the
Folsom-street line. He was alive but un
conscious when extricated from under the
wheels'and died soon after his removal to
the Receiving Hospital.
The railroad company has had a force
of men at work- for some time past re
pairing the bituminous pavement between
the tracks. The bitumen has bee"n cut in
many places by heavy trucks and a gen
eral overhauling of the roadbed was start
ed. Lennon. with another workman, was
engaged in making repairs on the track
near Ninth street yesterday morning,
when car number 1096, in charge of Motor
man Thady Begley, approached them at a
rapid rate of speed. Begley rang the bell
to signal tho men to get oft the
track. They stepped to one side and Beg
ley turned on tho current.
When the car was within a few feet of
the men Lennon must have become bewil
dered, for he stepped in between the rails.
It was too late to stop the car and the next
instant it struck Lennon with terrific
force. Ho fell across the track and hts
body was shoved ahead a considerable dis
tance before it dlsappered under the
dummy.
A crowd of horrified citizens who wit
nessed the accident hurried to assist in
getting the unfortunate man from under
the wheels. The body was Jammed in un
der the uutrimy and it was found neces
sary to lift the car off the track to reach
Lennon. He was still alive and was hur
ried in an ambulance to the hospital.
There it was found that his spine was
broken and that in addition he had re
ceived other injuries about the head and
body, sufficient 'in themselves to caus>3
death. Everything possible was done to
alleviate his sufferings before death came
to his relief.
Lennon was married and lived with his
wife and one daughter at 1 Cortland ave
nue, off Mission street.
Motorman Begley was arrested immedi
ately after the accident by Policeman
Conlon and booked at the City Prison oh
a charge of battery. He was released on
$20 ball and when subsequently he learned
of Lennon's death he surrendered himself
to answer to a charge of manslaughter,
being again released on furnishing 55Q
cash bail.
Begley says that he saw the men work
ing on the track and rang the bell to warn
them. "They got off the track." said he.
"and the car proceeded ahead. "When it
was almost abreast of Lennon he stepped
in front of it and I was powerless to save
him."
ST. PATBICK'S DAY WILL
BE FITTINGLY OBSERVED
Typical Irish Play, Concert, Oration
' and Po-sm Will Be
Features.
The St. Patrick's day celebration com-
mittee met yesterday afternoon at Knights
of Red Branch Hall. The meeting was
called to order- by President John O'Gara.
and after. the reading of the minutes of
the last meeting and communications sug
gestive ' of a programme for the Ob
servance of the anniversary the ; meeting
was thrown open , for â¢. discussion.' March
18 was selected as the day of celebration,
the anniversary falling on Sunday. -
A great deal of debate occurred In re
gard to the various features of the pro
gramme. It was decided that the Central
Theater should be engaged for the after
noon and- "Colleen -Bawn 'or some other
typical Irish play- presented. Immediate
ly after the play there will be an oratiou,
reading of a poenvand other literary ex
erclses. Mechanics' 'Pavilion will be hired
for the evening, where the programme
will be stereopticon views of Ireland, vo
cal music and a band concert. â¢
After considerable discussion It was
voted Â«not to hold a ball identified with
the observance of the day. A resolution
that:all available influence be used to se
cure a general closing on 'the day : ap
pointed was adopted. â -Various other per
tient matters were considered,, but it
was finally decided to leave- remaining de
tails to the committees, and the meeting
was then adjourned.'jggjgg .. Â¦.Â¦ .--.'
The wound which the hospital surgeons
mistook for a bullet wound was caused by
the girl striking her head against the end
of a protruding stair carpet rail.
"Oh, she threatened to, smash my face
and walk all over me." replied the girl,
"and when I came to I just felt as if she
had carried out her threat. - I suppose I
was a little crazy, too, so I just told the
doctors and policemen Rosle shot me. Oh.
what a headache I have!" she. concluded
as she drew the bed clothing up over her
head and refused to further discuss the
matter. <Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦â¢:Â¦ â¢
"I went with my slater to a dressmak
er's Saturday night," said the Mahoney
girl yesterday afternoon, "and from there
we went to the home of a friend on Hayes
street, near Gough. There I drank a large
glass of beer.' I am subject to fainting
spells and whenever I touch liquor I be
come dreadfully sick. When I left my
friend's home I was feeling ill. I thought
a glass of whisky might relieve me. I
went into a grocery and took two whis
kies. No, the whisky didn't do meany
good. I don't know just how I got into
the house. I fell and the next thing I
know I was here in the. hospital."
"But why did .you charge Rosie Bucns
with having shot you?" was asked:
When a thorough investigation proved
that Miss Burns had not been out of her
mother's honie after 10 o'clock Saturday
night, she was formally charged with as
sault to murder and released on $20 ball.
The charge will be dismissed to-day and
her accuser will go back to the Levy
home.
â¢ No one could be found who had heard
a pistol shot in front of the Levy resi
dence at 12:30 o'clock- yesterday morning,
but Levy and his wife were awakened by
hearing some one falling: on the stair
way. Levy hurriedly dressed and found
the girl lying in a pool of blood at the
foot of the stairs. The front door was
closed and it was while she was attempt
ing to navigate upstairs to her room that
Maggie lost her balance and fell. The am
bulance was summoned and while on the
way to the hospital the Idea struck Mar
garet to excuse herself by charging Rosle
Burns with shooting* her.
Up to within a year the girls were close
friends. They had a trivial quarrel and
womanlike ran to their respective friends
to tell their stories. The stories lost
nothing while being repeated and the
breach of friendship was widened. Al
though living within a few doors of each
other and meeting almost daily, they have
not spoken for more than six months. The
injured girl denies that she maliciously
told the story of the shooting In order to
revenge herself upon her former friend.
The only reason she assigns for making
the charge that resulted in Rosie Burns
being iield in custody, is t.hat she "must
have been crazy at. the tinJe."
. Margaret Is better known in tho society
circles in which she travels as Madge
Smith, for the reason, as she confided to
one of her girl friends, "Maggie Mahoney
sounds too Irish." She was taken to the
hospital for treatment of a wound on the
back of her head. There she told the sur
geons and reporters that Rosie Burns,
a domestic employed at 1307 Golden Gate
avenue, had shot her. On the strength
of tho yarn Miss Burns was taken from
bed in her mother's home at 1321 Eddy
street and after being "identified" by the
injured woman was held pending a fur
ther investigation.
One large glass of steam beer and two
glasses of whisky taken to "keep the beer
down" are responsible for the wild tale
of attempted assassination told at the Re
ceiving Hospital early yesterday morning
by Margaret Mahoney, a domestic, em
ployed in the home of L. Levy at 1303
Golden Gate avenue.
Maggie Mahoney's Story of
Having Been Shot Is a
Fabrication.

THREE LIVES LOST
IN BOSTON FIRE
The Assembly Committee on Commerce
and Navigation made an Inspection of the
San Francisco water front yesterday, the
members passing a pleasant day in look
ing wisely at the various objects called
to their attention by the harbor officials
who accompanied them and asking ip/*y
question?. The trip was made on C the
State tug Governor Markham. Oi\he
committee there were aboard the boat
McNeil of Humboldt, Kelly of Alameda,
Kadcliff of Monterey and Brown, Collins
and McLaughlin of San Francisco. Other
members of the Legislature, including
Chairman Knowland of the Police Inves
tigating Committee and Speaker Pendle
ton, were aboard. General Thomas J:
Clunie, the members of the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners, Secretary Eng
lish of the board, Chief Wharfinger Hen
derson and a number of ladies also en
joyed the trip and the beautiful day.
Captain Petzinger had his vessel deco
rated with signal flags spelling "China
Basin." The start was made from Mis
sion-street wharf and a run made to the
new fishermen's wharf, which was care
fully gazed at.
The committee was very favorably im
pressed with the -advantages of China
Basin, which was next visited.
Down along the line, or rather to the
Union Iron Works and Hunters Point
the Markham sped. All the members of
the Harbor Commission impressed upon
the members of the Legislature present
the fresh needs of San Francisco harbor.
The legislators seemed to enjoy the treat,
and at the request of "Spieler" Pepdleton
the boat was sent, to Goat Island in order
that the legislators might inspect the
United States naval training station. It
was a little off the beat, but the inspec
tion of the Pensacola wound up the day:
When the trip was concluded, the legis
lators from the interior expressed their
wonder at the size of San Francisco Bay.

could for the city. China Basin as land

CHINESE GAMING SUPPRESSED.
Last night the Police Department suc
ceeded in suppressing gambling In China
town, notwithstanding the statement that
this could not be accomplished. ; A hand
ful of officers, armed with axes, drove
terror into the hearts of gambling men,
and after a few doors had been hammered
down all the clubs were soon vacated and
the players dispersed. The streets of the
Mongolian quarter were thronged as a
result.
When the raids commenced early in the
afternoon and the order was given that
the doors of each club must remain open
for the police. . consternation prevailed,
among the keepers. At first the gamblers
resisted, but the patrolmen's axes were
brought into play and the Chinese found
that the order was one which would be
enforced. I-ast night before 10 o'clock
there was scarcely a club occupied. The
players had fled and the fantan and pi
gow paraphernalia stored away. The
doors were open and the police came and
went at will. Such a condition as this
has not existed before for some time.

The body of Mrs. Mary M. Seely, who
was murdered by her husband. Frank M.
Seely, was shipped to-day to her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Drummond. at Clover
dale, near Portland, Or. Mrs. D. B. Ladd.
a sister of the dead woman, accompanied
the remains. In accordance with instruc
tions from the Order of Railway Conduc
tors at Portland, of which Seely was a
member. Coroner Mehrmann has had the
husband's body- prepared for shipment.
No definite directions concerning the dis
position of the body have as yet been
received. It is presumed that it will be
6ent*to Portland, which is the home of
the suicide's parents.
The child Helen, who was made an or
phan by her father's tragic act, remains
now under the care of Mrs. Seely's rela
tives and friends in this city. There has
been nothing done with relation to her
future. It is said that her father was
insured in several beneficiary organiza
tions. That being 60, the little girl will
be provided for, as she is the joint heir
with her two stepbroth'â s, children of
Seely by a former marriage.
Mrs. Seely's relatives are not informed
concerning the value of her interest in
the Donnelly estate, of which her hus
band made mention in his letter to her
of February 4, the message which was
written to deceive her concerning his visit
to San Francisco which ended in the
Franklin-street murder and suicide. W.
H. Drummond. Mrs. Seely's brother, with
whom she resided here, Is undecided
about the care of the child Helen. It is
not unlikely she will be sent to the old
folks at Cloverdale. Â»
Drummond has abandoned tha fiat
where the shooting occurred.
"I could not live in that house, he de
clared, "with the horror of this awful
crime about it. All of my well-laid plans
have been upset. Sister and I had ar
ranged to furnish the place and to have
a home there for us all, with a chance to

since she came here last August, and
when we got this flat we decided to set

"She gave up herllfe for her child, and
it was a sacrifice that -she was willing

Accompanits Remains
â¢ to Portland.
1. "N'o man can escape from hla early
inpreÂ£sion.Â«, and it is fortunate that
Shakespeare lived his early life in the
beauty and simplicity of Stratford. In
nearly every play of his, he goes back
to It in thought as he finally went back
to it not as one weary of life, but asÂ» one
who had worked in order to enjoy life."
First evening.
Quote short passages from three or four
of Shakespeare's plays in which the poet
evidently draws upon his early memories
of rural English scenes for his descrip
tions. (
2. "What Homer's poems â¢were to the :
Greeks Shakespeare's plays .were to the !
Elizabethans and will be to all English
men." Second evening.
Explain and Illustrate this statement.
Quote passages from Shakespeare's plays
(as for example from "King John") which
have inspired Englishmen to be proud of
and love their country.
3. "Shakespeare frequently has several
more or. less fully developed ' actions or
stories in the same play, especially in hla
comedies." Third evening.
Mention the storiesâ in cases where
there are several stories. â to be found in, Â¦
say, three of Shakespeare's plays (includ
ing one tragedy). Detail somewhat par
ticularly what may be called the second
principal story in "The Merchant of
Venice."
4. "Lear, Hamlet, Othello. Ophelia, Cor
delia, are far more to the world than 1*
they had gone peacefully to the end of
their days." Fourth evening.
Explain this statement. Why should It
be so? What other characters alone of
Shakespeare can be placed with those
mentioned here? Why so.
5. " 'The wooing of Lady Anne by Rich
ard,' Professor â¢Furnivall says, 'has stir
red me in reading it aloud almost as
much as anything in Shakespeare." " Sev
enth evening.
Can you agree with this statement of
Professor Furnivall's? Give reasons ,for
your answer. Characterize in your awn
words and according to your own opin
ions the part played by Anne in the play
of "Richard III."
6. "Shakespeare of all men was the
least bookish." Eighth evening.
What evidence have we of this? What
was the quality of Shakespeare's knowl
edge? How for the most part was it
contained? Mention one or two other
great writers who were not bookish. Men
tion one or two who In your opinion were
bookish. â¢
7. "There were several facts which al
most forced Shakespeare to dislike and
antagonize the Puritans and to admire
and favor the â¢ crown and the nobility."
Ninth evening. â¢
Mention some of the facts referred to
here. What reasons have we for believ
ing that the statement in the quotation
is true? What was Shakespeare's att!
tude toward what is called in the text
"everybody's suffrage"? Is Shakespeare
to be censured for this attitude?
8 "No one can hope to understand
BODY OF SLAIN
WIFE SENT HOME
Noteâ Only eight questions are â¢ to be
answered in all, but these may be any
eight.
14. "The historians of the Elizabethan
age left us little about the everyday life
of the time, and we find slight Informa
tion on the subject in contemporaneous
writers txcept the dramatists. Shakes
peare in particular." Twenty-third even
ing.
Mention a half-dozen points of manners
or customs peculiar to the Elizabethan
age of which we get Information through
Shakespeare. Quote Shakespeare's very
words illustrative of each point mentioned
if you can.
15 " 'Shakespeare has no heroes.* says
the great apostle of the beautiful (Rus
kin); 'he has only heroines.' " Twenty
fifth evening.
What measure of truth Is there In thjs
statement? Justify it as far as you are
ableâ that is to say. from Ruskin's"stand
point. To what extent is the statement
not true? Substantiate your answer under
this head by references to thejfspeclflc
qualities of some of those characters in
Shakespeare's plays which we I usually
speak of as heroes.
What justifications are there in the text
for this statement? If the statement be
true, why is it that Henry V as a char
acter on the acted stage is leas Interest
ing and impressive than Hamlet or
Othello?
12. "If you compare 'Twelfth NIghf
with 'The Comedy of Errors' and 'The
Two Gentlemen of Verona,' you will find
a great similarity In the situations and
incidents; at times, too. in. the charac
ters." Twenty-first evening.
Specify briefly the similarities referred
to here. . Why Is it,- then, that "Twelfth
Xight" is a far more popular play,
whether to s=ee acted or to read, than
these two other plays? Wherein, for ex
ample lies the peculiar fascination of
"Twelfth Night" that makes it as popu
lar almost as "As You Like It?"
13. "The most famous of all the play
houses with which Shakespeare was con
nected was the Globe." Twenty-second
evening.
Describe generally the construction,
character, etc.. of Elizabethan play
houses. What was Shakespeare's special
connection with the Globe?
11. "Henry V as a master "of life Is In
finitely beyond either Hamlet or Othello."
Twentieth evening.
What reason is there for this state
ment? Is the misgiving justifiable? If
so. why is it that the play is not only
readable but likable and productive of
moral wholesomeness?
10. "Most readers approach the 'Antony
and Cleopatra." with some misgiving."
Seventeenth evening.
Give a synopsis of Dr. Rolfe's account
(as detailed In the text) of the composi
tion of "Henry VIII" and of the way the
facts concerning this composition wero
surmised and established.
9. " 'Henry VIII' is another play which
is Shakepeare's only in part." Sixteenth
evening.
Shakespeare who does not read carefully
every scene, every line in a play."
Twelfth evening.
Justify this statement. "Why. then. Is
Shakespeare so much "cut dowYi"" in mod
ern representations of his play? upon thÂ«
stage? As regards complexity of story,
wealth of incident and numerousness of
characters, how do Shakespeare's plays
compare with the classic plays of the an
cient drama?

A forceful sermon was . preached last
night at the First Methodist Episcopal

HONOLULU, Feb. ' 2.â According to the
report of J. C. Taylor, a mining engineer,
there la good prospect that the lands of
the American Sugar Company, an aban
doned plantation on the Island of Molokai.
may yet bo good sugar producing proper
ty, l^ack of water, compelled the giving
up of the plantation, which is the only
recorded failure of the kind in Hawaii.
Taylor says that a system of underground
tunnels and drifts will supply the land
in question. Hia plan will probably be
tried on Molokai and In some other places
where water is scarce.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The chambers of commerce and the
manufacturers' societies of Rhein coun
tries have adopted a resolution in favor
of higher protection against foreign hard
ware, especially American. The resolu
tion emphasizes the fact that American
pigiron is 50 per cent cheaper than Ger
man.
'.The London exchange being so near the
gold -point, the market fears gold ex
ports.
The Berliner Tageblatt sees in the steel
combination "a sharpening of American
competition; with German industry which
ca'nnot be overestimated."
The general firmness of the market Is
variously explained. The Vossische Zel
tung sees the chief cause inUhe two great
financial operations involving the Union
Pacific Railroad and the steel combina
tion. "America," it says? "has gradually
seized th-j -leadership of the world's finan
cial affairs, and Europe has grown accus
tomed to receiving its chief impulses from
the business movement beyond tho At
lantic." ... , . ,- .
Americans still lead the market, and
continue to- show remarkable strength,
the advance for the week ranging from 2
to 8 points. In this rise the leading shares
were Union Pacific, Wabash, Denver and
Rio Grande and Santa Fe. Yesterday, in
spite' of Berlin and London realizations,
the American section dosed firm, Wabash
being from 2% to 5 points higher; Denver

The weather has been boisterous for the
last threÂ« days, and the vessels in Apia
harbor have had a rough time of it.
At the United States naval station at
Tutuila many improvements are being
made. A new building for public offices
is being erected, the coal shed is being
completed, and It is expected to have it
ready for the reception of coal to. be
brought from New Zealand by the steam
er Abarenda. Many other improvements
of lesser nnlure are being carried out.
Lieutenant Commander Dorn is making a
careful and extensive study of native life
and manners. ,
The German Government is making a
good start In the educational line and is
already making preparations for larpe
schools. Governor Self Is about to proceed
to New Zealand for the benefit of his
health. He will be accompanied by Dr.
Funk, who has been in Samoa for the
past eighteen years without a change.
In response to the wish of tne Tutuila
natives an order has been promulgated by
lieutenant Commander Dorn, U. S. N.,
commanding the. station, to the native
governors, at the desire of Governor B.-
F. Tilley, who is still in New Zealand, ap
praising the taxes to be paid in Tutulla at
the sum of $7300 in produce. The Govern
ment intends to handle the sale of the
produce In the interests of the Samoans.
"Commodore" Weaver arrived by the
last mail from San Francisco- . He claims
to represent a British company. The
validity of the leases of large blocks of
land obtained by Weaver from natives
several years ago is challenged by the
German authorities, and he will have a
struggle for their -'possession. Weaver
says ne will make large improvements in
German Samoa, including a l uch needed
ice plant.
The German Government has ordered
the payment of taxes by the natives of
German Samoa, amounting to $1 per male
head. ' â¢
' D. S. Parker has sold somelurge areas
of the landof "Wellman. Neylan & Hobbs
of San- Francisco outside of Apia. The
prices were not high, but, were the. best
obtainable in the. present state of affairs.
Governor Self, has Issued a proclamation
calling in all guns held by Samoans In the
German division of the Islands. It was
well known that' many natives of both
parties did not surrender their arms when
called upon 'â¢ by the High Commission.
Governor Self offered to pay High Com
mission rates, thus withdrawing the pen
alty imposed by the commission for. non
surrender. Already some 400 guns have
been brought in, and. more are to arrive
in Apia from the country.
Great preparations are "being made for
the celebration of\ Emperor William's
birthday in Apia on January 27. : It . is
stated that during the three days' festivi
ties a general license will be granted
every one to do as he likes.
The .Tutulla people came In for a fair
share of that proportion allotted to the
Malietoa chiefs?, and a deputation was ap
pointed in Tutuila to proceed io Apia and
receive the Tutuila share. " The deputation
went to German Samoa under the author
ity ofUeutenant Commander E. J. Dorn.
U. S. N., who also supervised the division
among the people entitled to" receive the
money brought back by the deputation.
The -whole of the Tutuila money was paid
out with satisfatclon to the natives.

The police believe that the mother of
the infants, finding that she was too poor
to bury her children, .deposited them in
this place. The neighborhood was greatly
wrought up over the peculiar find, and the
gossips were busy discussing the affair
from their doorsteps. They were, however
loth or unable to enlighten the officers. '
Dr. Bacigalupi. autopsy physician for
the Coroner, examined the twins and pro
nounced them to have been stillborn.
M/s. Ketchum Informed the officers that
she found the bundle at 11 o'clock. Out of
curiosity she- took it into the yard and
upon opening it found the dead infants.
Believing that a breath of Ufa mijrht be
in the bodies, she hurriedly called Dr
McDonald, a physician, who is staying
at the house, and when he examined the
twins he pronounced them dead.
Detectives Dlnan and Wren were de
tailed on the case and made a thorough
investigation. They were, however, un
able to locate the person who left the
bundle. ' ;
Mrs. Mary Ketchum. who lives in the
upper flat, found th& bodies. They were
wrapped in an oM black . apron.
She took the parcel Into the yard,
and upon examining it was- greatly
shocked. She notified ; Jeremiah Murphy
and his wife and Murphy informed Of
ficers M.'J. Hemenez and Fontana. They
in turn notified the Morgue, and Deputies
Smith and Brown took charge of the re
mains.
The bodies of two female babies, evi
dently twins, were found yesterdaymorn
in the rear of 44S Natoma street. The
police were notified, and they questioned
the Inmates of the houses adjacent, but
were unable to discover the mother of the
dead infants.

POLICE INQUIRY
TO BE RESUMED
The second and last week of "Xell
SOUSA and his band were accorded
an ovation last evening at their
first concert at the Alhambra The
ater. J The house was not so crowd
ed as it might have been, but every
number on the programme was encored
again and again.
It is the same Sousa who returns to us
after his brilliant triumphs in Europe,
with the same old Sousa-lsms, Delsartean
graces, and easlly-lmitable mannerisms
that form the stock turn of every second
specialty company that strikes the town.
It Is the same band, too, with its color
ful, satisfying, full-blooded quality, and
inimitable swing and go, the same band
that has wrested from European band
authorities a quite unique admiration.
The programme contained many new
numbers. Chief In interest among them
was the "Capricio Italian" of Tschai
kowsky, which was admirably .given by
the band. A "scene and" ensemble" of
Giordano's also proved a most attractive
number, and a new Strauss "Czardas,"
"Ritter Pasman" and "Ball Scenes" of
Czibulka were enjoyably heard. But it
is In the Sousa marches that the peculiar
quality of the band is tasted, and in some
ragtime eccentricities that last year set
all Paris trying to waltz with one foot
while busily engaged in two-stepping with
the other.
"El Oapltan." "The Man Behind the
Gun." "Stars and Stripes," one old favor
ite after another, appeared in response to
the clamorous encores, and were again
encored on their appearance.
With the band this time comes the, as
usual, Indifferently good singerâ not that
it much matters, as It is the band one
goes to hear. Miss Blanche Duffleld has
a good voice of quite exceptional range
and excellent quality, but her method is
â¢distinctly amateurish. She sang a new
Sousa song. "Maid of the Meadow," and
was well received, and encored. Miss
Bertha Bucklin is the other soloist, and
Miss Bucklin plays the violin in quite
clever fashion. She has a" loose, facile
wrist, a clear technique, a larger tone
than the acoustics of the Alhambra Thea
ter permit of making apparent, and gave
the Rlc-s "Adagio" and "Moto Perpe
tuum" In quite musical fashion. Arthur
Pryor, the "Paganlni of the trombone"
as "the Belgians style him. was brilliant
and musical as ever in his solo, "The
Patriot." and its double encores.
A surprise of the evening was the pre
sentation to the conductor of a California
"bear flag," by an admiring company of
Westerners, who had witnessed a similar
presentation In Cologne during Sousa's
visit there. The ceremony was simple in
the extreme. One of the party, who re
mains "incog" by request, came upon the
platform after the rendering of Sousa's
new march. "Hail xo the Spirit of Liber
ty." and in a few words presented the
flagâ a rich white silk affair, red-edged
and lettered, and with the California bear
beautifullv embroidered in golden brown
upon it "From your friends Jn California.
as a token of the esteem in which you
are held in the Golden State." Sousa re
plied in a few well-chosen words, and
after saying that now he must serve "un
der two flags instead of one." started thÂ«
band with the "Star Spangled Banner,"
to which the audience arose.
The next concert will be given on Wed
nesday afternoon.
* â¢ â¢
For her last week's programme at the
California Theater Mr5. Fiske will give
during the first three evenings "Tess of
the D'Urbervilles." in which she has
created so favorable an impression, and
"Becky Sharp" will be given on Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday evenings, also
Saturday matinee. The two dramatic
features of the week are. of course, the
Fiske and Bernhardt engagements, and
the opportunity to compare the work of
the former, who has been freely styled
"the lereatest American actress," with
that of the srreat French woman, -will be
peculiarly interesting. Public opinion
seems to be about equally divided as to
the attractions of Mrs. Fiske's two play?,
the characters being so widely divergent
ss hardly to be comparable. "Tess" and
"Becky" have each their champions, and
whichever I? seen, the work is that of un
doubted genius. Mrs. Fiske will be fol
lowed by "The Waif* of New York."

"He wrote a play that he wanted us to
produce, but we declined . to handle his
production, becansn we remembered that
his 'Soldier of thn Empire' and his adapta-<
tion of the 'Corslcan Brothers' did not set
the town on fire nor did they fill the cof
fers of the box office to overflowing. In
his new play, called 'A Husband's Honor.'
his chief scene is a lion's den. I believe
the leading man rushes into the cage and
rescues some one. The only trained beasts
in this vicinity are possessed by Adtrfe
and we declined to engage the lady and
her pet?, because they were no longer a
sensation In this city. Hall sent me a let
ter that was more of a threat than an ap
peal. He notified me that he would resign
if his play was not produced during the
week of the 11th, and I informed him that
we could get along without him and hl3
play. Mr. Hall concludes his engagement
with the Central Theater thtÂ« evening."
"Hall was not adapted to the plays pro
duced at the Alcazar," said the manager,
"and when we opened the Central we
transferred him to thnt house and gave
him a chance to try his talents in melo
drama. He was doing- fairly well and
might have continued in the company bui
for his conduct.
The trouble between Hall and the man
agement is principally due to the actor.
He tried to have Belasco" & Thall stage
his latest production, entitled "A Hus
band's Honor," but the flrat-named mem
ber of the firm, havins? in mind the lack
of money-making qualities of Hall's pre
.vlous efforts, declined. Hall might have
overcome their scruples had he not been
rash in making threats. He notified the
management that if his play was not
staged he would depart from the Central
Theater. He labored under the belief that
he was an indispensable member of the
company. This belief was rudely shat
tered when his resignation was accepted.
Manager Eelasco expressed no regret at
losing Hall.
Howard Hall, 'leading man. playwright
and matinee idol, will no longer tread the
boards at'.the Central Theater. Lost even-
Ing he made his last bow to an audience
from the stage of Belasco & Tha.Â» s new
playhouse. He is now on the "Rialto,"
awaiting an engagement from a rival
management. Hall will never again be
seen at the Alcazar or Central theaters.

have placed the ban of their disapproval
upon him.
