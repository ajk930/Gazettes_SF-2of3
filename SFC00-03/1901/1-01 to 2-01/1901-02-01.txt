City Detective of Pawtucket Says
That Efe Has Evidencs Tending
to Implicate Pat Quinn.
PAWTUCKET, R. I.. Jan. 3Lâ It is the
opinion of the police of this city that Pat
rick Quinn. better known as "Dick"
Qulnn. is the murderer of May L. Fos
burgh of Pittsfleld. Mass. John F. Haber
lln. city detective, said to-day:
"Last summer I saw the hat left in the
FoEburgh residence by the burglars who
killed the girl. I recognized it as similar
to the hat worn by Dick Qulnn. He Is a
thoroughly bad man, just, such a criminal
as would kill a defenseless girl. I made
a search and found that Qulnn had been
in'Pawtucket August IS. I could not find
that he had left the town, and for the
time I dropped the matter. Lately I took
It up again. Now'l know that Quinn left
Pawtucket August IS. and I have also
learned that he went northward and that
he was in the vicinity of Pittsfleld August
19. Later ho started* for the West, and he
Is now, I believe, somewhere on the Pa
cific Coast. My opinion is he is the mur
derer of Miss FoBburgh. If he is caught
though, this mystery perhaps can be en
tirely cleared up."-

made to cover the stands with purple

Stands are being erected ciose to St.

hide the palace from the Malls. Even on
the outbuildings of the palace, on the bal
cony whence King Edward's accession
was proclaimed and in the gardens of
Marlborough House similar provisions for
spectators are being made. Carpenters
and Joiners are everywhere building
stands and shoring, up balconies.
The same condition of things prevails
in Piccadilly. Seating accommodations
are being prepared in every possible nook,
from Devonshire House to the balcony of
Apsley. Lampposts and obstructions m
the middle of the roadways are being re

In Hyde Park, of course, neither decora

only an occasional glimpse of a purple
draped balcony in Park Lane is obtain
able. In the Tdgeware road, and thence
to Paddlngton, are the liveliest scenes of
all. The entire population of the district
and suburbs seem to have congregated
in search of accommodations and traf

which gives it the appearance of a busy
market. Hardly a'hou&e but is being let

for seats on uncomfortable stands and on
the smallest balconies.

with stands erected in the gardens as4
people eagerly pay Â£3 or Â£4 for seats on

was expected that Schley would remain
on that station until near the time of his

The South Atlantic squadron at first
consisted of three vessels, but one of
these was transferred to the Philippines,

PLANS OF THE EARL MARSHAL
At Osborne this evening all is quiet.
During the day the royal personages
walked about the grounds and passed the
hours in much the same way as they had
done for a week or more. Two solitary
policemen guarded the lodge gates. Down
the road to the Sound carpenters are dis
turbing the quiet hedgerows by the hasty
erection of stands, and in Cowes and East
Cowes there is the same noise. But win

greater expectancy is, the announcement
that Queen Alexandra and the Princesses
of the royal blood will walk down the
muddy road and through the narrow
streets to the .water's edge. This part of
the programme thus' far holds good, al
though should rain be . falling when the
procession starts from Osborne House the
royal ladles will scarcely persist in their
determination.
It Â¦will probably be nearly 4 o'clock to
morrow afternoon when the Alberta, with
the royal coffin, leaves Cowes. ' She will
steam into the single line and' then enter
the passage ' formed by the leviathans.
This evening she lies at Trinity pier. Her
quarterdeck is covered, with awnings, un
der which the men have been working
throughout the day in making the final
preparations. The awning was necessary
because rain fell until a late hour, cold
and dreary weather prevailing.
Apart from these peaceful rows and
rows of (winkling port ilghts,., separated

Three days ago, it is said. Savage again
maltreated the woman and her son re
newed his threats. It Is stated that Sav
age aaving become aware of Davenport's
menaces attempted to bluff him this even-
Ing Into yielding up his revolver, but the
bluff failed.
The wound In the former Councilman's
hand will cause him to keep the member
In a sling for some time. After the states
man from the Eighth Ward was locked
up, deputations of brother statesmen, who
had learned of his mishap, called at the
station to offer expressions of sympathy
and to counsel absolute' silence. From
less secretive Individuals the alleged cause
of the shooting was learned. The New
Arlington lodging-house, whose clientele
consists mostly of nondescript females and
their male friends, was conducted by May
Davenport. Her love for Tom Savag^
began to cool over two months ago when
another favored suitor appeared. Two
months ago Savage gave the landlady a
beating on account of her fickleness, and
at that time young Davenport announced
his intention of killing Savage if he struck
his mother again.
Patrolman Hubbard found, young Dav
enport In the Bullard block, where he was
looking for a doctor to dress his wounds.
The young man showed signs of having
been drinking. He said at the central
station that he had a permit to carry a
pistol and that the permit had been pro
cured for him by Savage within a month.
None of the men or women In the lodg
ing-houso would give any information, as
they .uad been cautioned to be careful and
keep their mouths shut. A revolver with
a piece of the cloth of Savage's coat was
found on the floor. The revolvers used In
the duel had been secreted before the ar
rival of the police.
In response to a telephone message sent
to the police station. Patrolman Shand
and Hubbard went to the scene of the
shooting. They met Savage at the foot
of the stairs. He refused to tell the
cause of the shooting and denied that he
had done any of the pistol practice him
self.
Tho former Councilman fired a bullet
which pierced the left hand of Davenport
without, however, breaking any bones. It
grazed the skin of Davenport's abdomen.
Although several other shots were flred,
two by Davenport and three by Savage,
no further damage was done. The wound
ed men broke away from each other and
pranced around in the corridor, which
soon became besplattered. with blo~d. .
Davenport replied, "I'll give it to you as
good as I am able," and producing his
own revolver flred at Savage. The bullet
plowed through Savage's hand, shattered
several of the bones, and entering his
clothing, creased the skin of his abdomen.
Savage refused very positively to give
his version of the fight. Davenport was
not quite so mysterious about the matter,
but he was equally careful not to tell
about the original cause of the shooting.
The young man stated that he "was seated
in room 20 of the Arlington when Savage
came in and took a seat on the other side
of the table. They quarreled over a sub
ject which neither cared to divulge, and
Savage, according to Davenport, sudden
ly drew a revolver and said to the young
can: "You give me that gun of yours."-
Both men were wounded, their Injuries
being very similar In character. After
their wounds were dressed both â¢were ar
rested and locked up In the City Jail on
charges of assault to murder.

NEW ORLEANS. Jan. 31.â Passengers
from Port Llraon, Costa Rica, report com
plications between Costa Rica and Nica
ragua growing out of the Invasion of the
former republic by an armed force of
Nlcaraguans. Tho two republics were on
very hostile terms only a few months ago
owing to the dispute over boundaries and
both gathered almost their entire military
force en the frontier to prepare for war.
Actual hostilities were prevented by 'the
interference of United States Minister
Merry.
Since then the countries have been 0:1
peaceful terms, but President Zelaya of
Nicaragua complained that Costa Rica
was harboring 1 a number of Nicaraguan
rebels. Plotting and conspiring among
the refugees in Costa Rica was General
Mena,
A fe,w days ago a force of Nicaraguan
soldiers, acting under instructions from
Zelaya, crossed tha boundary line, cap
tured La Cruz and marched General Mena
and the Costa Rican commandant into
Nlcarsguan territory. A force of 500 Costa
Rlcan soldiers was immediately ordered in
pursuit of the kidnapers.. They arrived
at the scene of tho kidnaping too late,
however, for General Mena and the com
mandant of La Cruz h,ad been safely car
ried to Managua and were imprisoned
there.

On roll call a number of members re
frained from voting and afterward voted
"aye" and a few changed from "no" to

"no" to "aye", and gave notice of a mo

Fisk closed the argument wrth a speech
full of emphatic assertions of the Legis
lature's duty to inquire into the alleged
alliance between the San Francisco Police
Department and the gamblers and tne
prevalence of other forms of vice under
the protection of the law.
Speaker Pendleton ruled Fellz's motion
out of order, but upon protests by John
son, Dunlap and Melick he confessed his
error and put Feliz's motion to vote,
promptly declaring It lost and ruling that
the demand thnt was heard for a roll call
was upon the motion to adopt the resolu
tion and not upon Feliz's motion. Melick
protested against the shutting off of de
bate, and Pendleton finally consented to
withhold the roll call until members
should be heard.
. Fisk said that the misconduct of the po
lice had .been notorious and there ought
not to be any delay. Savage of Los An
geles said that when the laws of the State
were being flagrantly violated there must
be not a moment's delay, "much less a

-"I have- been familiar with â¢ Investiga
tions by the Assembly, for some years,"
Feliz continued, "anrl it is true that at the
bottom of every one of them has been
nothing more nor less than a political
scheme. In every case there have been
outside Influences'- and the purpose has
been to make or- destroy the political fu
ture of some man."

matter, and moved that the resolution^be
made a special order for. to-morrow morn

Feliz said he believed San Francisco to
bft fully capable of dealing with this prob
lem without calling for the aid of the Leg
islature In a matter outside of the latter's
province.
"I have no desire," said Fisk. "to do Re
publican politics in this matter. Therefore
I ask, if thia resolution be adopted/that
neither myself yor any other member
from San Francisco be appointed on tho
dommlttee. but that country members en

Â£ MENTO. Jan. 31.â The Assembly
B k took upon itself this morning the
X^7 task of fiitpmiitir.tr to purge tho
San Francisco Police Department.
After an acrimonious debate a resolution
offered by Fisk was adopted authorizing
the Speaker to appoint a committee of
five to investigate the charges that a
compact exists whereby police protection
is extended to Chinese and other gam
bling games in San Francisco.
Speaker Pendleton has selected as mem
bers of the committee the following
named: Knowland of Alameda (.chair
man), Webber of Napa, Schillig of Yuba
and Sutter, Wright of Santa Clara and
L.aird of Kern.
The resolution. met with severe denun
ciation as embodying a partisan scheme
aimed at the wrecking of political hopes,
and several members of the majority, no
tably Brown of San Mateo. Dunlap and
Mclick, pleaded for delay, asking that at
least one day be given for Assemblymen
to familiarize themselves with the import
of the resolution. Several members of the
minority also bitterly opposed investiga
tion but the motion to 'adopt was crowd
ed through wlt'i vindictive haste, and the
vote upon it stood, ayes 46, noes 22. The
resolution is as follows: ,-,
Wherras. direct charges hav<? been madÂ»
that various forms of Chinese and other gam
bling games, forbidden by the laws of this
State are being conducted and carried on
openly In the city and county of San Fran-
Whereas, It has been charged that the Police
Department of said city and : county has for
some time declared Us Inability to suppress
eald gambling games; and
Whereas, It Is also charged that the Bald
Police Department of San Francisco. In view
of its acknowledged Inability to close said
games and punish such offenders, has entered
Into a compact or agreement with said per
sons operating and conducting said gambling
games, to allow said gambling Â¦ games to run
openly and without molestation, and In direct
violation of tho laws and statutes in force in
this State; and
Whereas, such charges have . been given wide
publicity In the press, and should therefore
be Investigated, to the end that, if found to
be true, the Legislature should enact such
necessary legislation as will enable tho Police
Department of the city 'and : county of San
Francisco to suppress such ; gambling games;
or should It be found that the present laws
of the State are sufficient to enable the said
Police Department to bring about' the suppres
sion of said gambling games and the convic
tion nnd punishment of the guilty parties, then
to recommend such legislative action as will
require and compel the said Police Department
and officlalb in control' In said city and county
to at once suppress such gambling games and
punish the offenders against the laws "of the

garding State health regulation,
introduced In the Legislature at
the behest of the Governor, were
given a new lmpetU3 by a message he
sent to both houses to-day, which throws
light on the reasons which prompted the
measures. His message told of a commis
sion ; secretly appointed which has been
sent to this coast and Is laboring secretly
on the problem which the State thought
had been fought out and solved.
An effort waa made to call the blll3 out
of the committee to which.they had been
referred so that action could be taken im

impossible action was postponed, but it
will be delayed no longer than it takes to

presented a report out of order recom

of J. Keenan. He denied that his business
here had any connection with the meas

he was visiting relatives. To-day he re-

EXECUT1VK DEPARTMENT.
FTATE OF CALIFORNIA.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 31. 1301.
To the Atssmbly of thÂ» State of California:
I have the honor to represent to your hon
orable body that upon Sunday, the twentj
sevrnth <1ay ot this month. I received infor
nwtion that the United States Treasury De
partment had sent to this State Â«t commission
o"eâ¢nertÂ» to make an ex parte Investigation
?nto the condition ot the public health of our
.State, and that some U the dlstmÂ«u!shed mem
bers of t-ald commission were already In the
rltv of San Francisco.
HpallzlnK the gravity of an Investigation con
ductedin 5Â«-reV. without any opportunity on
fhe part of the State authorities to Â«Â«"nlne
into the work a* It 1* intended to be con
r-ucted by the said commission appointed by
fhe United States Treasury department. I
flamed It of the most Immediate importance
fo innulre of the President the reasons and
Duroo^o of this secret i-ommlsslon. and on the
Â»Sth^ ir^tant I transmitted the following tele
eram o the President of the United States:
â¢T have "been Informed that the Treasury
Department has sent a commission of experts
SSS rnSS^nVingX
J. J. Klnyoun to the surgeon general of the
Marine Hospital Service.
"I hope that In this matter of vital Interest
to the people' Of California there Is no Inten
tional discourtesy on th* part of the oSlcer
directed by the Treasury Department to super
vise this investlzation.
"In this matter, which concerns deeply the
welfare of this Stato, I respectfully request
that co-cperatlon with Uie State authorities by
Huch experts should be advised. In order that
the State may select eminent home bacteriolo
gists nnd physicians as well as. If deemed
necessary, bacteriologists and physicians from
other Â£iates and countries, to eimatno the
same suspected eases, so aa to arrive at a
correct and Impartial conclusion.
"I dislike much now to call your attention
to this matter, but thÂ« Irreparable Injury here
tofore tiorfe to this State by unfair and ex
pane examinations itairants this, appeal."
Yesterday oTternoon 1 received from the hon
orable the Secretary of the Treasury tHe fol
lowing telegraphic reply:
" "Reply Ing to your telegram of January -X
niMre.-.-Â«vil to thÂ«* President, the commission
appointed by this department embraces ex
perts who by reason of technical knowledge
ar.d'persDnal experience with the disease make
it the hljhsst possibles authority. They ar<Â»
from great Institutions of learning entirely
disconnected 'with any department ot the Gov
ernment, and ire chosen from different sec
tions of the country, wholly on account ot
their attainment?, and have been directed to
call upon you for the purpose of pa>ing their
respects and acquainting you with their work.
In no sense therefore is any discourtesy in
tended, and the department deÂ»ir<rÂ« the com
mission to make tli?se investigations In Its
own way. unhampered by detailed instruction*
from the Marine Hospital Service or any other
Influence. It Is expected to ascertain the facts.
and the department does not feel It should
hamper the commission in its method of in
vestigating and getting at the facts. It will
be independent of Dr. Klnyoun or any pre
vious reports. Its conclusions ure to be basej
on Ha own observations ar.d will be made
known to this department r'.one and promyU/
forwarded to you by the Department."
From thls> answer cf the Honorable the SÂ«^
retary of the Treasurx It la apparent that
State co-operatlcn Is refused, and that the In
vestigation of the commission will be con
ducted wholly uptfn such lines as will exclude
any possible opportunity en the part of tha
State to either verify or refute any position
which may now or hereafter be taken by thÂ«
said commission or the United States Marina
Hospital service.
Under these circumstances the State Is ncv
forced to rely upon an Investigation pursued
by a commission which It has neither Invited
to Its territory nor In the selection of whose
personnel It has had any voice.
The previous Inaccurate reports respecting
the existence of bubonic plague In this State,
which has resulted In the injury to the repu
tation for health of this State as well as in
Injury to Its citizens, industries and commerce,
have been the consequence of a system of ex
parte Investigation, without opportunity of
State examination or supsrvl3lon.
The repetition of such Investigations upon
secret lines, without public scrutiny under
State authority as have been heretofore pur
sued will Imperil the welfare of every citizen
and inhabitant of the State and will bring dis
tress to the farmer, orcaardlst. horticultur
ist, manufacturer, tradesman, merchant, as
well as to all our marine and land transporta
tion companies.
The meanest criminal under the constitution
of the United States cannot be dented the right
of being confronted by his accusers, listening
to their testimony and subjecting them to crcss
examinatton. and shall It be contended that tha
great State cf California shall be unjustly de
nied a similar privilege In th* opportunity of
facing those who. impugning the public health
as the result of & secret and one-sided examina
tion, might choose to cast an Irremovable
blemish upon the State's lanltary condition,
on which the personal rights and property of
her citizens In a large measure depend?
The State belns denied a hearing I con
scientiously believe, therefore, that - legislation
la Immediately and urgently needed toy which
our State may assume that general and on
restrained control over the subject of the public
health within its borders which Â»o vitally con
cerns her, and which Is her Inalienable right
by virtue of her sovereignty.
Impelled by the sense of raWe duty. In view
of this exceedingly grave situation, I rely upon
the discretion of your honorably body to tak^
such appropriate action in the premises as may
be deemed advisable. IIKNRT T. GAGE.

were not confined yesterday trs
Sacramento.
A new witness, and a Vitally Important
one, has appeared In this city and
before the investigation is over he will
give his testimony at the Capitol. This
witness Is Andrew Dennis, the colored
porter â¢who served the California Oom
misFion at its headcuarters in Paris dur
ing the ?tay of those Interesting officers,
at the French capital'.
Drr.r.is had an opportunity of seeing
everything which transpired at the head
quarters, and the story h<> tells of the
netiens of the Commissioners and their
friends la one of shocking immorality,
drunken revelry, pnmbling among men
end women, neglect of duty, misappro
priation of exhibits and other derelictions
Â¦which reflect anything but credit upon
the commission. This porter describes the
fight between Commissioner Foote and
Commissioner Truman. He relates the
duties 'hat the Commissioners forced him
to perform for their private benefit.
He tells of a gambling pariy in which
one of the Commissioners lost 2500 francs
to a woman and was forced to go to the
bank the following morning to secure
funds. He relates the incidents
which accompanied the visits of
disreputable women to the head
quarters, and he recites a tale
Â¦which is perhaps more shockingly sensa
tional than any which has yet been. told
of the commission and its affairs.
Young Dennis begins his recital by
telling of incidents which immediately
precsded the celebration of July 4, 1903, by
the California Commission.
"Sousa had promised to attend our cele
bration," t=aid Dennis last night, "and
preat preparations had been made for the
affair. Commissioner Truman had told
the other Commissioners that he Â¦ would
attend and then he told me that he would
r.ot, as he did net like the character of
the people who had been invited.. I knew
then that something was wrong among
the Commissioners, but Truman Was not
the only guiltless one in the crowd.
"He used to send me out every day with
from three â¢ bottles cf wine to a case to
take to his home in Paris or to his friends
and he never even paid for the express
age on them. I used to take this wine
frcra the stock belonging to the-commis
sion. While we were there Truman
moved his residence and I had to do the
moving. I dipcovered that he had stocked,
his place with canned goods, fruit o?
every description and -wines which came
from the store of the California exhibit.
"One day he took me downstairs to the
cafe and asked me If Foote and Gaskill
were talking about him. He told me
that neither Foote nor Gaskill were any
prÂ»od. and that he was getting tired of the
â¢whole affair. When the wine was taken
cway Gaskill would always demand that I
Â£*>t vouchers for that which Truman took.
but I never got any vouchers for what
the others sent away, and they sent a
treat, deal. Emlay took away a great
deal of wine, and Truman told me that
Kmla>l was selling it to the various ho
tel*. Xo inventory whatever was taken
cf the stock at the California headquar
ter?, and any amount of stuff could be
taken out and was taken out while we
were there.
"One day Loeb, th<> French interpreter
who was employed by Secretary Gaskill,
came to me. very early <n the morning
and asked me for the keys of the wine
cellar. I pave them to him and thrn got
up to ?<e what he was doing. I discov
ered that he look away several cases of
Â¦wine in a hack. Loeb was cmploved by
QaskttJ at a sa'.ary of $03 a month.* which
v.as raised to $M a month. When we
reached Paris he bought a quantity of ob
ecru-> French pictures which he tried to
Â«e!Â» to visitors who rameXo the California
headquarters. Complaint was made by
two California:-.* and an investigation was
made, but nothing further was done.
"As for the wines given to the Juries,
no more than twelve bottles were supplied
to thÂ«m, and I got those for the Jurors.
The Commissioners were very seldom at
thÂ«Â» headquarters, and Assistant Secretary
Dargie and I were the only people there
to welcome visitors, who would very fre
qupntly ask who was running the place
end wh^re the Commissioners wore. The
Commissioner?, as a matter of fact, were
at Henry's, an American bar on the Rue
des Capuchins, playing poker and doml
riocs with Americans all day long. They
were very seldom at the headquarters,
and Dargie and myself were left there
Â«lonÂ»Â».
"One night I went to headquarters and
fotind Commissioner Truman sitting In a
chair grossly and helplessly drunk.- He
had been nauseated in-; was in a very
unpresentable condition. I went away and
In the morning when I returned I found
Commissioner Truman Iving asleep on a
bear rug on the floor. He went over to
Henry's, the American bar, and got credit
for four bottles of wine which Commis
sioner Foote paid for
"In September came the fight between
Commissioner Foote and Commissioner
Truman.. I knew the fight was coming be
cause I heard some one tell Mr. Footo
that unless he punched Mr.-Truman in the
3aw things would be disagreeable for him.
The day of the fight Commissioner Foote
wai In the headquarters when Commis
nioncr Truman entered. ' Truman went In
to the Inner- room and- a minute later I
beard curses and a striking blow. There
were loud. words and scuffling and I and
air. Darde rushed Into the room.
"Mr. Foote Â¦was getting. 'the worst" of
It, as he was. very gToggy 'that day, and
Just as I entered Mr. Truman had an Ink
well In his hand and was about to throw
It at the head of lir. Foote. I Jumped
at Mr. Truman to hold him and Mr. Foote
chouted: 'That's right, Andrew, hold him*
the fellow won't give me a
square deal and will kill me.* I held Mr.
Truman and turned him over to Mr"
Dargie. I then escorted Mr. Foote down
stairs to the street, where a hack was
waiting, and where Mr. Foote met a lady
friend. They drove away together Mr
Foote and Mr. Truman did not speak to
each other for a week after that.
"Poker parties were very frequent at
the headquarters, and Commissioners
Koote and Runyon and Secretary Gaskill
tnd several of their lady friends took part
in them. Sometimes the ladles won and
sometimes they didn't. It depended alto
gether on who they were. Some of them
could play better than others, and, of
course, they won. In one party a lady
won 2500 francs from Commissioner Foote.
and be was forced to go to' the bank the
next morning lo get some money. But
that lady was a pretty good poker player;
she came from Honolulu.
"Once In a while ladles would come up
to see Commlsisoner Foote when they
were Jn distress. I loaned one cf them 53
francs myself, but Commissioner Focte
paid It back. The lady was an actre3Â»
who .used to play at Morosco's. ; She Is in
Paris yet, I think, because there Is no
sloners were not .frequently sober, but 1
suppose they were having a good time
and it was none of my business. This i
think Includes In a general way, without
entering Into a variety of details, what
I know of what happened in the Califor
nia headquarters at the Paris Exposition."

TRUMAN SCORES FOOTE.
Beplies to the Colonel in Extremely
Harsh. Words.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.âThe Investigation of the
Parts Commission took on a more roseate
hue this afternoon, for most of the time
was spent in investigating the. alcoholic
capacity of the Commissioners and their
willingness and ability to carry away
Wine from the storeroom at the head
quarters. In the general mix-up Truman
suffered most. There was not a good
word said for him during the afternoon,
and there were plenty that were bad.
Robert Itcss. son of United States Judge
Ross, v.-ho was one of Gaskill's.assist
ants, was the most interesting witness of
the session. Ho was called to tell what
he knew of the doings of the- commission
during his month ot service.
Regarding the number of visitors at the
heauquarters Kofs said 'JUO a day wouj<
be a large estimate, and of these more
than hair were Americans.' Tney were
shown the exhibits' and through tne
rooms, and were given wine if they
wished it. '
"Did you ever see anything Improper
around these headquarters':'' askeu Mel-
Jek. "Ye* r I have ' seen* Air. Truman
orunk several times," was the answer.
â¢Did you ever see Mr. Gaskill undet
the influence of liquor.'" "So, I never
saw Air. Gaskill drunk."
â¢'Did you ever see Foote drunk?" "No,
not in tne headquarters."
"Ever see him drinking elsewhere".'"
"Yes; I have seen Air. Foote when he
had been drinking. I have seen him take
six cocktails in an afternoon, if that is
wnat you mean."
"Did you ever see any carousals in the
headquarters in which there were
Â¦women?" "So, I never did;"
"Why did you leave the employ of the
commission?" "I was asked to resign by
the secretary, who said the board had or
dertd it. 1 refused to( resign until charge*
were preferred against mo. and 1 think it
was Mr. Gaskill who said the maps I
was working on were not coming oat rap
idly enough. I explained this. 1 They said
1 had opened\wine without authority and
1 denied this.' They said, too, I was in
toxicated, and this, toor, I denied, for it
was not true. Nest day I got a note
from the commission asking lor my res
ignation."
Four months later, Ross said, Truman
called him Into his room and in the pres
ence, of Marais, who was called In as a
witness, told Ross that as his dismissal
had not been* entered on the minutes the
commission was willing to treat the in
tervening time as a vacation and would
take him back and give him his salary for
that time. Ro?s refused the offer.
Th%n the witness offered this letter in
evidence as showing Truman's version of
the affair and also the feeling that ex
isted in the commission last September.
PAHIS. Sept. 26. 1900.
My Dear Friend: Your son returned here
to-day, and as Foote is in Spain and Gaskill
In lÂ»ndon I called the boy into my i*om in
the presence of a witness, not to listen to
him. Imt to myself (and, by the way. I did
Â£>!! thev-a'.klnm, and 1 told him (your boy) the
vlr>!e s-tory of his damnable treatment by
FtpcteâVhlcta I had said trÂ» Foo.'e before he
v<nt tj Madrid âand his inhuman treatment
fcv the ww-llvfd, dirty. Infamous dog' Gaskill,
n.\l sÂ»a>i lo him that the commission would
ncf ac-ewt his resignation. As the dirty dog
c.-i-Mll ,8 away and cannot control the wpak
n-inAo.1. weak-Stne^d Foote if he comes back
ti'-mprrow, and the latter will return from
Ki'iyfr to-morrow. I think, and as I have gen
rrslly been ipnored by Foote and Hunyon in
rr.oj-t matter?, 1 shall now insist upon not
recognizing your son's reslpnetion forced by
the infamous Oaskill and v*><? cowardly W.
W. Foote and tell b!m to draw his salary for
four months and consider that he \As been
9 member of the commission all the time, and
that nothing has happened. 1 have told Rob
bie that he need not pay anything against
Toote to any human being (except his lather
and mother), and that he should tell no person
what I have done. (It would take a dozen
pages to tell you of the infamy of Secretary
i;.â¢!!â¢ kill, who controls Foote.) All this I have
said to" Foote. I knew his father, and I hated
to say fo. but I told Foote to his race that
ho was untrue, unfair, unworthy and con
trolled by Oaskill. I said even more. But
vour son shall be rifchted to-morrow or when
Foote returne or there- will be a dreadful
scene. But, my diear friend, while Foote ccmes
from a fine Southern family, he is a liar, a
traducer and a coward. Yours very truly.
BEN C. TRUMAN.
Binee writing you the foregoing Uobhle has
paid to me that Foot" and Oaskill have paid
t-> him that they tried to save him, but "old
Truman insisted en kicking him out."
Was there anything so damnable? Why I
frught putting him out all the way through.
Feote applied all the epithets known to your
bob and ordered him with oaths not to smoke,
etc. and Gaskill set him to work in the
kitchen with a negro and a French cook in
order to humiliate him and get rid of him.
Well, your son is and has been an attache of
cur commission all the time or there will ba
a hell of a scene to-morrow. TRUMAN.
Rofs had much more to say of Truman
and Foote and how each of them would
come to him privately and after swearing
roundly at the other, would suggest that
he go and repeat the remarks. "They
wore not men enough to talk to each
other." said Ross, "fo they used to come
and tell me."
Emlay also told of Truman's convivial
habits, going into great detail.
"I was coming home on the night of
July 7 last," he said, "and on going Into
the" headquarters I saw Truman there. He
was very drunk and was looking pale and
sick. 1 tried to revive him and worked
over him for four hours. Then he felt
better and I left him. I saw him again at
6 o'clock the next morning. He was look
ing very bad, dirty and sick. His face
had not been washed and he was looking
very disreputable."
"Was that the only time you ever saw
Truman drunk?" continued Mellck.
"No." said Emlay. "I saw him drunk
one day, it was the day Mr. Runyon was
leaving, down at the depot. He had a
bottle of wine under each arm and said
he wanted to give Mr. Runyon a good
send-off. He was attracting a great deal
of attention and was making quite a
Ecene."
Mellck asked many questions regarding
the receipt which Emlay had been given
when he paid the money for medals to
Aine, and he called Emlay's attention to
the Item. "Four bronze medals at ?20
each. $100." Emlay declared he knew of
no such discrepancy when he paid the
amount, nor did he know of the discrep
ancy, he said, until Melick showed the
receipt to him. He was asked what there
was about the bill which showed that It
had been paid and he pointed to a rubber
stamp mark'- at the ; bottom. Ho
said that In France all bills were
receipted In that way. He said he
paid the full amount showing on the re
ceipt, and he did not know nor did he
rind out later that it was $20 too. much.
Later A. Ekman, who was In charge of
the mining exhibit, was shown the re
ceipt and he said he would not have ac
cepted It In that form as a receipted bill
Ekman was called to the stand to ex
plain the damage done to the Davidson
quartz specimen, which he did by saying
some of the points were chipped off by
poor packing. He added nothing to the
scandals, except to describe a drunken
waiter who attacked him and whom he
hit with his fist.
This evening Judge Henshaw and Erall
JCusbaumer came up from Oakland and
until late -to-nieht they were closeted
with Foote and Runyon and the Governor
In Foote's rooms In the capital Hotel. \v
H. Mills may be called to testify to-mor
row, and Joseph Lynch Â¦will also be on
hand. The turn of affairs this afternoon
which brought the Inquiry into the per
sonal conduct of the Commissioners is
likely to assure the opposition which
Foote promised in the first place Jf per
sonal conduct should become one of the
subjects Inquired into.

Stomach troubles are so common and In

Armed parties of Creeks have been In

was at Little Axe's ranch, a few miles

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â The Demo
cratic Senators and their co-workera In
the Senate who are opposed to the ship
subsidy bill did not hold a formal con
ference to-day to decide upon & course
to be pursued . with reference to that
measure, as had been announced they
would do. The explanation was made
that it had been discovered that the op
position was so determined as to render
a special meeting unnecessary*. While
there was no caucus, however, there waa
a general exchange of views of the mi
nority Senators, which enabled the lead
ers to form a quite definite opinion at the
close of the day of the position of the op
position as a whole. The decision
reached Is to continue the debate upon
the bill at the present, with the hope of
being able to keep It going until it will
become necessary for the Republican ma
jority to take up; the appropriation- bills
and other measures which should pass be
fore the 4th of March. They say that they
have speeches assured for eiKht or ten
days, and there ape'probably other Seno
tors who will prepare speeches within
that 'time. Among those who will talk
are Senators Daniel, Caffery, Berry,
Kenny, Allen. Money, Lindsay, Butler
and Pettlgrew. Senators Clay and Tur
ner also will make : speeches in addition
to those they have already delivered on
this question. It Is expected that Sena
tor Caffery will talk at least two days.
The opposition also count upon speeches
Irom the Republican side of the cham
ber, Senators Allison, Perkins, Spooner
and McCumber being Included In the list
of probable speaker?.
The' canvass of the situation has con
vinced the Democratic leaders that there
are half a dozen or more Republican.Sen
ators v.'ho would like to see the bill de
feated even in its amended form, but they
do not expect to cast their votes against
the bill if it should come to a vote. On
the other hand, they count upon the loss
of some of their own membership in sup
port of the bill.
The Democrats contend that they do
not want to filibuster against the bill, but
say they will insist upon Its thorough dis
cussion before consenting: to vote upon It.
They take the position that If there is
to be an extra session of Congress it will
be better for them to have the subsidy
matter among the questions to be con
sidered by It. and say they are willing to
take, the responsibility of the defeat by
legitimate means of this proposed legis
lation.

it seems clear to me that the practice
or treating transportation over the bor.d-
Kld*d roads as if it cost the Government
nothing oupht not to be continued. On

Mr. Gape replied that he considered the
oebt of the Contra! Pacific well secured
f.nd he paw no reason why the War De

for freight, etc.. to lines in competition
with that road. The Central Paciflc now

street on the north, flfty-four In all.
The explosions this afternoon tock place
in the "shaving: tower" and wrecked the
tower and demolished the roof of the
'Â¦njrine house. The force of the explosion,
which was probably due to gas. was tre
mendous. The disintegrated brick work
fell on the engine house, crushing It. and
the concussion of the explosion cracked
the bis- smokestack â 100 feet highâ that
towered over the engine, room.
Nearly S00 persons were at work In the

tower adjacent to the boiler-room in
Â¦which the explosion in the afternoon took
place. The remains of the tower fell into
the boiler-room and on top of adjacent
rooms. In which were stored chemicals
for seasoning wood, thua causing a. sec

Walking Belegate of Building Trades
Council Threatens a Strike Order
" Against Contractor Hartman.
An edict by Harry Saunders, walking
delegate of the Building Trades Council,
threatened to impede work being done by
the paperhangers employed by George
Hartman on a building at 10 California
street yesterday. Hartman and nineteen
of his employes were busy completing the
job when Saunders arrived on the scene
and demanded that the contractor forth
with' discharge Richard Euchaurk and
George Frank . Suerwein, both members
of San Francisco Union No. 136 of the
Painters, Decorators and Paperhangers.
Saunders declared that his order would
have to be complied with by 1 o'clock or
he would order out the men at work who
belong to the Building Trades Council.
The two men whose employment by,
Hartman waa responsible for the contro
versy are Germans, and their union Is un
officially called the German union. It re
cently got a State 'charter, and its mem-
Bers have worked on numerous jobs In
peace with the rival organization until the
trouble arose yesterday, Hartman stated
that he had nothing to do with any differ
ences between the two organizations and
paid all. of his men the union- rate of $3 50
per day. He said, however, that if the
Building Trades' delegate insisted on the
discharge of the objectionable workmen
he would lay them off under protest. At
4 o'clock Sunders had not appeared at the
building to order the strike, and the work
was completed last night. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 3l.-More wreck
agre, other than that , reported yesterday,
has been found at the north end of Van
couver Island. It Includes a boat, part
of tne deckhouse of a sailing vessel, a
quantity of gingerbread work, some I of
which is painted blue, some Tarnished and
with brass fittings, evidently part of the
interior fittings of some craft; the chest
of a seaman and the front of the chest
of another sailor, which was of mahog
any and brass bound: some new barrels
with galvanized hoops, a lapstreak boat
two rudders and the mast of a whaleboat!
. Thestf things, together with sawn lum
ber and rough boards, said to be sufficient
to make cargoes for two ships, have been
found by Indians at Winter Â¦Harbor thS
entrance to Quatsino. In. the sailor's
box which came ashore waa needle and
thread and some paper with writing- D re
sumably a. letter. Unfortunately the In
dians were unable to dry this stuff suf
ficiently, to preserve the writing, or this
might have proved from what vessel the
wreckage came. There was nothing on
any of the wreckage to Identify It
.w U A s believed by many that it is from
.the Andrada, although other than the
piece of teak found with' the name of this
vessel cut In it nothing has been found to
prove this, and the authenticity of the
name on the teak board does not seem to
be clearly established, for a telegram re
ceived from. Lighthouse Keeper Daykin
says that the name seems to have been
cut with a knife. The salmon found adds
to the fears for the. Ardnamurchan. La
bels found at Astoria have been received
by the Vancouver packing company, and
they assert that these labels were part of
the -cargo of the Ardnamurchan.

them. While Wednesday's cn-
gagemer.t at Tanforan was all in
favor of ihÂ» talent. tue*bookrnak
rrÂ» came back t-tronply reinforced yester
day and in some heavy eklrmishlng tho
speculative brigade retired with revere
loatn The fripld weather caused nearly
all of the summer suitings to be called in,
and Â¦even! of the jockeys rode as if frost
bitten. With the t>xcept ion of Handicap
per. a 7 to 5 favorite, and Favonlus. a sec
ond' choice, outsiders grabbed all the loot.
One of feveral tirange happenings was
that of making Montanjc. carrying 111
pounds, favorite over Favonius for the
seven furlong run. The latter horse had
only II" In the saddle, but as he had not
been out in public for quite a time was
*uppo*e<i to be "short." and 2 lo 1 was
Jald about him. Aftor causing Dick
I>wyer no end of anxiety by his behavior
at the post, Monianic linally broke away
with the others, left foot nrst. Not the
least dlf-ccnceru-d. Buchanan soon had
him in front under a choking pull and
perched directly behind his mount's ears.
Once in steht of the wire Favonius col
lared the favorite, and he gTowled as the
l>cne was taken from him. Later on True
Blue, aroused from a lethargy of some
standing, came very strong, compelling
Henry to fhuke up Favonius again to win
by over a length in 1:26. Thus perished
one good thing; and there were others.
Not unlike the thoroughly enraptured
and impatient novel reader, several chap
ters might be temporarily skipped in or
der to reach the concluding' one, wherein
Native ligured fuch a factor. Sam Hil
<lreth's horsM? hau â¢ been entered and
eeratehed once before, and in the closing
event was heralded as the real thing,
opening at even money. Then, stories of
his lameness became circulated, and as
the horses we:it to the post Dollie Weit
hoft> odds fell from 3 to 2 and the price
against Native went to the same figure.
Sad Bam for a time showc-d in the lead
until Native swerved in, closing him out.
With the latter horse groggy, Torslna
picked up th<Â» running and looked a win
ner, when O'Connor came with a rush "on
Good Hope, a 25 to 1 snot, winning by a
head. rX>Ule Weithoff met with poor rac
ing luck, finishing lourth.
Alzura. a lu and 12 to 1 shot, beat a
bunch of cheap onts in the opening sprint,
well ridden by Nash Turner. The mare
lÂ«Â»d from th<Â» klckoff. reaching home three
lengths ahead of Kavallng. Fondo, the
favorite, received a poor send-off, never
being prominent.
Although the distance looked a trifle
short, Handicapper apparently had the
class over hi? company in the third race,
a seven furlong run. Seven to five was
the ptneral ring price, and O'Connor
brought the gelding In first, a neck in ad
vance of Mbmallade.' Bothered on the
back stretch. The Singer ran an excellent
race, taking the show.
What a motley gathering of cheap rac
ing material was dished up in the

By good saddle work Johnny Woods man
aged to get to the v.ire Hrsi with Charles
Is* Bel, a 10 to 1 *hot. which downed Fidel
Youlin a neck. Necklace, the favorite,

far.
Scotch Plaid disappointed a big follow
ing by running unplaced in the mile and
seventy yards "selling affair. The Burns
Â£ Watrrhouse horse closed an even
money chance, and at no stage of the
running looked a winner. Astor, with
Tommy Burns In the saddle, led to the

POOL SELLERS
ARE ARRESTED
Sacramento Police Begin a
Crusade Against
Offenders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 31.-Warrantp
Â¦were sworn out to-day for the arrest of
lour poolsellers. Charles Lusk, Mike Mul
len. Henry Meyers and Fred Rohrer. Al
though there is a etrict ordinance against
poolrooms In this city and although the
claim has been made that the law was be
ing obeyed, the fact has long been known
that it _was constantly being violated
and that the sale of. pools to regular cus
tomers was going on to an extent almost
equal to the business transacted before
prohibitory measures were enacted. The
present coup appears to have been con
temporaneous with the Grand Jury In
vestigation growing out of charges in the
BeÂ« as to the r-xtent of the poolroom
business. Chief of Police Sullivan in a
statement to-night declares that he has
been attempting to gather evidence
against the poolsellers for a long time
and that the arrests are the culmination
of these efforts.
The parties arrested to-day are, with
the exception of Mullen, merely the man
aging .attendants of the three poolroom
concerns, whose owners are Daroux,
Cavanausrh & Rot-s. Mike Mullen and
Edward Kripp. It appears that the pool
rooms secured their Information from
headquarters In Washington, Yolo
County, directly across the river from
Sacramento, these headquarters securing
their returns by direct wire from Tan
foran Park.- It has been estimated that
a business of $1000 per day has been going
on in this city at a time when the clergy
men Â»nd church-going element who parti
cipated in the memorable anti-poolroom
crusade fondly believed that the evil had
been effectually stamped out of exist
ence.

Winnie O'Connor on Good Hope Beats a Field of FastOnes
at Odds of 25 to 1â Ring Does Better.
Three bantams, six welter, three mid
dle and two heavy-weight contests made
up tne, fistic card at the Olympic Club
last evening. A little more of action and
incident was scattered through the pro
gramme than on the opening night, and
the crowd warmed up to the bouts in
good old fashion.
The very last fight on the programme
proved the sensation of the evening. It
was between A. J. Gallagher of the San
Francisco Club and Al Duffy of the
South Knders. Gallagher is something
new in the way of prize-fight physique.
He is so fat that his flesh hangs all over
his belt, and he wobbles with every
movement. At the same time he waa
easily the cleverest boxer at the show
last evening, and his punching was hard
enough to double his opponent, Al Duffy,
in knots. In the second round Gallagher
landed very heavily on Duffy's jaw. The
latter went to the floor and out. Galla
gher looks like the winner in his class.
J. Fields, a strudy bantam of the Olym
pic Club, in the first round of the first
tight landed a stiff heart punch with his
right on.J. McKalley. McKalley's face
became twisted and he dropped to the
floor. Referee' Smith stopped the tight,
giving thv decision to Fields. The crowd
applauded the decision.
F. H. McConnell, O. C, and J. C. Dolan,
W. O. A. C, bantams, fought three rounds
in give-and-take fashion. McConnell was
the aggressor throughout, but found a
man oi good, sterling mettle In Dolan.
The decision went to the Olympic Club
man.
Willie Snailham, whom Alec Greggalns
seconded and whom he has dubbed
"Thurston the Second," finished Al Craw
ford in the second round. In wild, un
measured fashion Snailham threw his
arms and fists at Crawford for one and a
halt rounds, when the referee stopped the
light, proclaiming Snailham the winner.
Then came the welters. In the second
round of the tight between M. J. Breen,
O. C, and N. McKean, unattached, the
referee stopped the battle because he
thought Breen was outpointing his oppo
nent without a break. The action of the
referee was not thoroughly satisfactory
to the crowd, which was anxious to see
the fight continued to Its natural end.
H. W. Finke, O. C, and amateur cham
pion of the United States, used the best
part of a round to put plucky R. Donald
son, unattached, out of business. Donald
son was knocked down twice by Flnke's
strong right, and then his seconds threw
up the sponge.
W. Brock of the Reliance Club and
James Pallas of the South End Rowing
Club went the three rounds. Pallas Is of
the Sharkey type and he used his human
sledge-hammers on Brock from start to
finish, getting the decision.
Then William Gooby, Pacific Athletic
Club, and J. Doyle, O. C., flashed three
rounds of llstlc afrce. Gooby threw him
self in the way of Doyle's long left, spun
around when hit and tried glove gymnas
tics, to the great amusement of the house.
Doyle was an easy winner.
T. Stone and Gus Baraco followed. Stone
came all the way from the Reliance Club
and Baraco was home talent. When they
had gone three rounds the judges called
for a fourth, after which Baraco was pro
nounced the winner. The Reliance men
present hissed the decision roundly;
M. J. Lawlor. Unattached, and T. Wolff
of the Ariel Club put up what was the
most earnest and hardest tight of the
evening. For three rounds they drove
left and right into one another with un
remitting vigor. An extra round was
called and AVolff's aggressive work won
him the decision.
F. Wegener, Olympic Club, and H. Ken
ny, unattached, were next in the ring.
Wegener fought In his old careless stylÂ«.*
In the second round he found Kenny's
chin with his right and Kenny measured
his own distance on the floor.
J. Mijlott of the San Francisco Athletic
Club and George Cluff of the Pacific Ath
letic Club mixed matters for half a round,
when Cluff went down and out.
H. Foley of the Ariel Rowing Club and
F. Â¦ Bayly of the Olympics went three
rounds of torrid fisticuffing. Bayly was
at his taller antagonist continuously, re
ceiving the decision.
George Maclntyre of the Pacific Ath
letic Club and Thomas Lynch of the South
End Rowing Club met in the first of the
heavyweight fights. This fight was tinc
tured with blood, both men bleeding' pro
fusely from deep gashes on the head.
Lynch got the decision.
A. J. Gallegher. "San Francisco Athletic
Club, fat and heavy, then met Al Duffy
of the South End Rowing Club in the con
cluding bout. Gallegher's victory sent the
crowd home In a happy moot!.
The programme for this evening will be
carried through the semi-finals In the
featherweight, bantam, middle and welter
weight classes. Left in the bantam class
are Fields. Snallham and McConnell. In
the featherweight class are Danzigcr, Rl
ordan, Moran. Lundie. Kreling-. Leonard,
Howard and Long:. In the welterweight
class are Pellas, Finke, Doyle, Breen, Bar

class are Bayley, Millett and Wegener.

CARSON. Jan. 31.â Senator Flantgan
Introduced a bill in the Senate to-day re
pealing the prizefight law. This law was
originally passed in 1S97 to allow- tha
Fitzsimmons-Corbett fight to take place
in this city. In spite of the fact that
prizefighting has been legalized in this
State since that time, there has not been
a fight within the State during the four
years. It. is thought that thÂ« measure
will bring out a hot argument, as many
of the members in both houses consider
that the bill as It stands comes nearer
expelling prizefighting from Nevada
than it would should the law bÂ« re
pealed.

Is somewhat of a "terror" himself while In
the ring. In discussing 1 the Australian
lightweight yesterday. Cribb grew en
thusiastic and In his excitement dropped
a string of "h's" that would have tripped
up an ordinary conversationist. .
" 'Egarty," he said, "is a foÂ»ghter
harfter me own 'art. *E can 'it as 'ard as
a bloomin' 'eavywelght. If 'e meets JIc-
Govern, I'll bet 'e will make Mm think
there is a foighter in front of 'ixn."
Before the Sonoma sailed last we* for
the Antipodes. George Harding, manager
of "Soldier" Phil Green and Otto Cribb.
talked with the steward, and they agreed
to brins Hegarty over on the return trip.
Hegarty is looked upon as tha cleverest
exponent of the art of fisticuffs in the
Colonies, lie has foupht more than a hun
dred battles during hla seven years' rtns;
experience and be it said to his credit he
has never been knocked out or had a de
cision against him. Hegarty has met
lightweights and middleweights in his
career and has laid hla opponents low
witu his flats. He has the cleverness of
Griffo and the hitting power of a man
nearly twice his weight. He is only
2J years of age and is suid to be a world
beater.
Other Australian pugilists and sporting
men join Cr;hb in praising Heparty. They
say that ho is worthy to battle with Mc-
Govern and if he were to meet the Ameri
can in this city the international contest
would prove a tremendous drawing card.
The fact that Tom James Is bringing
Hegarty to this country Is an evidence
that the pugilist id a K<>od man. James
has the distinction of having brought
Fitzslmmons, Jim Hall, Griffo, Murphy.

NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Jan. SI.â A bill
introduced In the State Legislature to-day
giving the Newport News Shipbuilding
and Drydock Company the power to sell
Its big plant here at any time to any cor
poration created something of a sensation.
It is not unlikely that this bill is one of
the results of the recent conference In
Richmond, at which, acordlng to reports,
a combination of large American ship
yards was agreed upon.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â The information
that the Newport News Shipbuilding and
Drydock Company has applied to the Vir
ginia Legislature for authority to sell its
plant to another corporation was regarded
in this city this evening as an Indication
that satisfactory progress had been made
in the direction of combining the ship
building plants of this country by the pro
moters of that enterprise.
â¢Charles R. Flint has been making ef
forts in that direction for some time. Up
to the present time no definite announce
ment has been made of the name or cap
italization of the company. Persons inter
ested however, have stated that it was
not conceived In opposition. to the Cramp
Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia,
which however, will be the principal com
petitor, and the amount of stock has been
placed at $60,000,000.
A meeting of persons interested in the
scheme was held at Richmond, Va., a few

ST. PATRICK'S
ALLIANCE MEETS
MRS, EMMET BURKE AKD â¢ _
HER HUSBAND ABBIVE
Honolulu Heiress Becomes the Wife
of a Texas Section Foreman's
Son.
Mr. and Mrs. Emmet Burke of Paris,
Texas, are at the Occidental. They are
enjoying their wedding trip. Mrs. Burke
was formerly Miss Mamie Smith, an
heiress of Honolulu. The husband is a
son of a Texas and Pacific Railway sec
tion foreman. A short time before the
couple's marriage it was currently report
ed here that the young woman had prom,
ised her hand in marriage to a prominent
San Francisco attorney, who has been her
legal adviser.
The news of Miss Smith's marriage to
Burke has naturally created some little
comment here. She was not disposed to
epeak about the affair at the hotel last
evening, declaring that her marriage was
none of the public's affair and that she
didn't propose to be disturbed by her gos
siping acquaintances. The couple are to
embark for Honolulu. on the next steam
ship. They will make their home there.
London, Conn.; the Bath Iron Works of
Bath. Me., and the Morris Shipbuilding
Company of Camden. N. J.
The scheme owes its origin to thÂ© ship
subsidy bill. As stated by one of the pro
moters, the Intention is to divide the ship
building work among the different con
cerns interested, so that instead of, as at
present, one yard being- engaged In build
ing war vessels of two or three different
types and also merchant vessels, each
plant will confine Itself to one class of
work.
An Important meeting of the members
of the Produce Exchange was held yes
terday afternoon for the purpose of tak
ing some action In the proposed forma
tion In this city of a great commercial or
ganization that has been under serious
consideration by many of the leading
business men of San Francisco for several
weeks. The scheme involves the dis
solution of the Produce Exchange and
of the Merchants' Exchange and the for
mation of an entirely new commercial
body of greater scope to Include in its
membership the present members of the
two organizations named and all kindred
organizations in the city. The new com
mercial exchange will be formed on the
same broad lines as the great commercial
bodies of New York. Chicago, Hamburg,
Germany, and other business centers .of
the world.
It is proposed that the new organization
shall have a home of Its own fully in
keeping with its importance and the meet
ing of the Produce Kxchange yesterday
was partly for the purpose of discussing
the steps necessary to secure an adequate
flite for the new structure and to take ac
tive measures for carrying on the pre
liminary work. The idea of the majority
of those Interested In the movement has
been from the start to secure the property
of the Merchants' Exchange on California
street on which to erect a new modern
eight-story building fully adapted to tho
needs to which It will be put and there is
every indication that this' plan will be
carried to a successful consummation.
At yesterday's meeting, which waa execu
tive. It was announced by William Bab
cock, who presided, that nearly four thou
sand business men are taking an active
interest in the formation of the new
orgrmization which will embrace all the
various mercantile Interests of the city,
now represented in independent bodies.
No opposition to the project has thus far
been developed, and as It is clearly some
thing that will be of vast benefit to the
entire commercial community, none is ex
pected to materialize.
At the opening of the meeting Secretary
T. C. Friedlandor- announced that the
object of tho meeting was to take steps
to secure an extension of the option on
tho Merchants' Exchange building from
the association owning it. The Produce
Kxchange owns a controlling interest in
the stock of the Merchants' Exchange
Association and it is proposed that the
now exchange shall purchase the prop
erty for J300.000. The representatives of
the Merchants' Exchange were willing
yesterday to extend tho option for ninety
days and the members of the Produce Ex
change decided to accept the offer.
The new exchange will probably be
called "the San Francisco Merchants' Ex
change" or "the Pacific Exchange of San
Francisco." Its mission would be to pro
mote uniformity In the customs and
usages of merchants; to Inculcate prin
ciples of justice and equity in trade; to
facilitate the speedy adjustment of busi
ness disputes: to acquire and disseminate
valuable commercial and economic in
formation and generally to secure to its
members the benefits of co-operation In
the furtherance of their legitimate pur
suits. The new exchange will taJte In
as members all those engaged in shipping;
the handling of grain, hay and produce;
the coal and lumber trades, railroads. In
surance, banks, real estate agencies, stock
and bond brokers, oil dealers, handlers of
dairy produce and in fact all branches of
Nearly 400 names have been subscribed
for membership In the proposed exchange
and as a seat In the new organization Is
flxed at $500, this will give a capital of
$200,000. Certain business men, whose de
sire la to see San Francisco In the front
rank, have signified their intention to
make up any deficiency in the $300,000 re
quired to purchase the present Merchants'
Exchange building. , These public-spirited
men are willing to loan the money re
quired by the new exchange and will not
ask any Interest on tho amount they will
furnish until July. 1903. If at that time
the required capital has not been sub
scribed by members then tho men who
have furnished the balance of the capital
are to receive 4 per cent bonds for the
money they have furnished.
The prime movers In the proposed ex
change are enthusiastic and confident
that San Francisco will eoon have an or
ganized body of Us varied business In
terests which will wield a power In the
country and secure for San Francisco
the many things It needs. The new build
ins which the exchange will erect will
have a general meeting hall and board
rooms' for the many Interests It will bring
under one roof. The Chamber of Com
merce will also find accommodation In tho
building. There will be "pits" for the
stock brokers, grain and oil -dealers and
the other floors will be devoted to offices.-

no good -purpose, but neither of whom, he
thinks, was Shannon. Hall was awakened
early in the morning by hearing some one
moving about the room.. He sat up in bed
and saw two men, 'neither of whom, he
said yesterday, was "Wilson or his pal,
opening a bureau drawer. He demanded
their business, and one of them said, "We
want to see Jim." Hall told them they
were in the wrong room. As they went
to the door he said he saw the glint of
something which looked like a revolver in
the hand of the shorter man and thought'
It the better part of valor not to follow
them. Hall says one of them might have

NO COMPETITIVE
TEMPLAR DRILL
Feature to Be Abandoned in
Conclave of Grand Com-
Grand Commander Miller; Disap
proves of the Plan â Prepara
tions for an Imposing Af
fair Next April.
Hiram T. Graves, recorder of California
Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar, is
in. receipt of a communication from Grand
Commander Frederick M. Miller in which
the latter states that ho is not in favor of
the proposed competitive drill and the of
fering of prizes in connection with the
entertaining of the Grand Commandery at
its forty-third annual conclave, to be held
in tnis city in April, 1901.
Upon the recommendation of a commit
tee consisting of Sir Knights William Ed
wards, Robert B. Moore and E, 8. Bean
of Golden Gate Commandery No. 16 and
fairs Henry 11. Ream, A. A. Batkin and
K. P. Hunbut of California Commandery
lc was resolved in regular assembly that
the consent of the grand commander be
asked for the drill to be engaged in by all
Â¦commanderies of the jurisdiction outside
of this city. It was also resolved that four
prizes be offered for the competitive drill,
and that the silver vasr. now in the asy-r
lum of California Commandery be given
as the first prize. It was thought that
this would be the foundation for a drill
corps in every commandery.
Un^er date of December 28, 1900, Grand
Commander Miller wrote as follows:
I bet to acknowledge the receipt of your
favor of tho 26th lnst. requesting an Intima
tion of my .views on the proposition of the
drill corns of California Commandery No. 1
and Golden Gate Commandery No. 16 offering
four prizes to be drilled for by the command
eries outside of the city of San Francisco, said
drill to take place during the next annual con
clave of the Grand Commandery next April.
Believing it to be your desire to make the
next conclave one of great interest surpassing
those of the past, and, also believing that thii
Idea will be the means of creating new en
thusiasm in these commanderies and result in
much-needed improvement in their tacti
cal work, I desire to say that I am in favor
of It. I am heartily in accord with any
proposition that will result In greater pro
ficiency and that will stimulate the dormant
energy that exists in some of our command
eries. And who knows but what this may be
the foundation for a drill corps in every com
mandery? I will grant the desired permission
when same Is officially made by your 6everal
commanderies, provided the programme Is ar
ransed so it will not interfere with tho work
of the erand body.
Subsequently the grand commander
wrote: â¢
After an investigation I am convinced that a
competitive drill and the offering of prizes
would not be wise, and I thought that after a
talk with your officers they might conclude to
withdraw the request made to me for permis
sion. I would much prefer they did bo, and
now offer the opportunity for so doing.
Up to the present time no one knows
what caused : the grand commander to
change his mind, as he has not assigned
his reason, and the officers of the local
commanderies have not heard from him
on that point. It Is probable, however,
that the request for the competitive drill
will be withdrawn.
Recorder "William T. Fonda announces
that Golden Gate Commandery has Be
curcd the Mechanics' Pavilion for Satur
day evening, April 20, for the purpose of
entertaining the Grand Commandery.
California Commandery has engaged Odd
Fellows' Hall for the three days of the
annual conclave, and invitations will be
sent to all the commanderies of the State
as well as to the officers and past com
manders to partake of Its hospitality. The
affair will conclude with a ball, display
drill and a grand banquet.
The eminent commander has appointed
as members of the executive' committee
to take the whole matter In charge Sir

â¢A Russian traveler who was recently in our midst
says that we must do something to stimulate and in
crease our trade with Siberia. ' If we do it is safe to
say that we will show no particular inclination to
make our social relations closer. Our Siberian
friends have made in China altogether too spectacu
lar a record in war. .
Gold, it is said, has been discovered in the neighbor

The fact that San Francisco merchants and manu

PERSONAL MENTION.
PEDRO SANCHO.â An Oak!and corre
spondent takes issue with this department
In regard to an answer about pedro san
cho. The answer given was on the judg
ment of a number of old-time and con
tinuous sancho players, who declared that
whether nine or five counts first in a gamÂ»
depends upon the understanding had be
tween players in the tame and that in
San Francisco the general rule is to count
as the answer stated. In Oakland there
may be a different rule. The latest edi
tion of Hoyle says: "In pedro sancho thÂ«
five and nine of trumps count their pin
value, bo that eighteen points can be and
are made in one deal: one each for high
low, jack and game and fourteen for the
nine and five of trumps. These two trump
cards have no special rank. Tha ten
would win the nine and the six will take
the five."
ROYAL. CASINOâ H., City. I- royal ca
sino the three court cards, 0 king:, queen
and jack, have a pip value and may be
used in combining or building. In the or
dinary game they can be used only in
pairs. The, jack is worth eleven, the
queen twelve . and the kinc thirteen, so
that a nine arid two can be taken with a
jack, or a six and four and three with a
klngr. In the same manner a aueei! will
win a jack and ace or a kinc will win a
jack and deuce. This department has not
been able to discover any rule by which
the ace counts fourteen.
HER FAMILY NAMEâ R. K., Wood
land, Cal. Royal families drop their fam
ily names and cannot in reality be Â«ald
to have any. The late Queen Victoria
belonged to the Hanover family and her
name, if she can be said to have any
aside from her title, was Guelph. Princes
of the royal blood are christened and mar
ried by their titles only, and their family
names become, by Intermarriage, extinct.

Cal. If in a double game of pedro A and
B, partners, have twelve to go and C ani
D, their opponents, have two to go, A and

A CHA1TCE TO gTVrTT.T*
It now remains to be seen what the Mayor will do.
If he desires to support the gamblers he must come
out openly atid make the fight with them for the re
opening of Ingleside. He can no longer hope to get
the Legislature to pull the chestnuts out of the fire
for him. He has openly broken many a pledge made
during his campaign, and perhaps he may yet be bold
enough to break those he made so often during the
first fight against the gamblers. Should he do so, the
public will know exactly how to meet him. If he have
not the courage to make that sojt of a fight he will
have tÂ» abandon the cause. It is evident the Legisla
ture will not help him. '
The action of the Senate 'committee exposes the
futility of Mayor Phelan's attempt to dodge the issue
raised by the effort to provide for reopening of Ingle
side track with its gambling accompaniments. He
sought to shift the responsibility from himself to the
State Legislature. Had the Belshaw bill been ap
proved and enacted, there would have been a speedy
way found for reopening higleside, and the Mayor
would have given his sanction under the pretense of
compliance with the State law. In that way, while
helping the track gamblers, he would have made a
show of some sort of fidelity to his pledges, and might
possibfy have deceived a considerable number of
credulous people. As the. matter stands he has made
his dodge in vain. The Senate has refused to act as
a buffer for him. The issue returns to this city, and
the Mayor must declare himself on one side or the
other.
The objections to the bill were based upon the
valid ground that legislation of that kind ought to be |
left to local legislative bodies, that each community \
should have the right to determine for itself whether I
or no it would permit racing with pool-selling and
bookmaking or other gambling privileges within Us
limits. There can be no question of the soundness of
that view. San Francjsco has disposed of the whole
subject in accord with the will of an overwhelming
majority of her people, and other counties where track
gambling of any kind has proven to be a curse to the.
community can readily follow the example.
AS was reported in The Call yesterday, the Bel- i
Shaw, anti-poolroom bill was on Wednesday I
almost unanimously condemned by the Senate !
Committee on Corporations, to which it had been re
ferred. After a long and full consideration of the
measure the committee decided by a vote of seven to
one to report it with a recommendation that it do not

PHELAN'S FUTILE DODGE.
"In this day of almost universal extradition treaties," said an old Federal
official to a New Orleans Times-Democrat reporter, "it is next to Impossible
for a fugitive from justice to find a spot beyond the reach of a warrant.
But only a few years ago there were plenty of places of refuge, and the officers
us=ed to have some peculiar experieices In trying to decoy shy blrda'over the
danger line. One of the funniest things of that kind that ever happened took
place at Niagara Falls, when Canada was still a haven for embezzlers. A
white line across the middle of the old suspension bridge was supposed to in
dicate the boundary between the two countries, and the bank looters who
had taken up their residence on the other side seemed moved by some Irre
sistible fascination to stroll -frequently in that direction. They would come
as near as possible to the fatal mark, and more than one foolhardy Individ-,
ual has been yanked across by detectives who -were lurking on the other
side. However, to get to my story, one of the runaway colony at the tlma
I have in mind was a man named Patterson, who had been president of a big
bank somewhere in the Northwest "and who had finally decamped with all
â¢the visible assets. The victims of the defalcation were unusually sore. and.
instead of letting the case drop as hopeless when the fugitive reached Cana
dian soil, they quietly raised a purse for expense money, hired a couple of
the best detectives they could find and told them to bring Patterson back by
hook or crook, if it took them ten years to do it. The detectives put their
hf>ads together and a month or bo later they suddenly turned up on the
Canadian side in the role of two runaway cashiers. Their idea, of course, was
to get acquainted with their man, win his confidence and then watch for a
chance to kidnap him across. The first part of the programme was not espe
cially difficult, â¢ and the three were soon on excellent terms. The detectives
told Patterson a cock and bull story about their supposed , embezzlements, to
which he responded with some confidences of ids own, and their Intimacy
grew with pleasing rapidity. Like most of the other exiles, the trio frequent
ly strolled down to the bridge and peered wistfully toward home over the
white line. Of course the detectives didn't dare to rush their man across when
there was anybody in sight to Inform against them for kidnaping, but one
night they proposed a stroll to the river, wnen as luck would have it the
bridge was completely deserted. They sauntered up the footway and sat
down on a ledge at the side, quite near the line. -The sleuths glanced around
stealthily, saw that the coast was clear, and closed in suddenly from each
side. 'The jig'a up, Patterson!' said one of them, seizing- him by his lapels;
'we're sorry to do it, old man, but we'll have to take you across!' 'In that
case you'll have to take the bridge, too,' he replied calmly, and pointed to
his left wrist. It was handcuffed to one of the big steel suspension strands.
'I did mat little trick as we sat down,' he continued, 'and took the precau
tion to drop the key in the river. The fact is, boys, I've been on to you for
several weeks, and 1 couldn't resist the temptation of giving you a little sur->
prise before I let you go. I've been carrying these handcuffs for just such an
emergency every time we took a walk.' 'Thunderation!' groaned one of the
officers; 'run for a file!' 'It would take you an hour to file those links,' said
Patterson blandly, 'and a watchman passes every twenty minutes. You'd
better run for cover.' The sleuths 'looked at each other, swore fluently and"
disappeared on the American side. The man who told me the story," added
the old officer, "insists that Patterson then extracted a duplicate key from
his vest pocket, unlocked the cuffs and strolled home, whistling 'Annie
Laurie.' "

Cr^ieriTAL FREIGHT RATES.
r\ N Associated Press dispatch of yesterday from
/ \ Kew York reports that considerable interest
is being shown in that city over the publication
in The Call of the injustice done to San Francisco by
the transcontinental reads in making freight rates to
the Orient which discriminate against this city in fi
vor of New York, St. Louis and Chicago. The dis
patch went on 10 say: "Vice President Hawley of
the Southern Pacific Company when questioned to
day denied that any discrimination against San Fran
cisco was being practiced br that road. The matter
of naming lower through rate;; in connection with the
ocean steamship lines was, he said, an old one, anu
there had been no new developments to bring the
subject into special' prominence." "
After such a statement from the vice president of
the Southern Pacific road there is nothing for The
Call to do but to repeat its original charge with the
evidence to support it. The '"new development" which
brought the subject into special prominence at this
time and led to the statements of The Call was the
issuing by the transportation companies of a docu
ment known as schedule F to supersede schedule E.
When first issued the effect of the new schedule was
not clearly understood here, but it was understood in
the East, and exporters from New York, Chicago and
St. Louis were prompt to take advantage of it. The
railroads themselves, in fact, began drumming up
trade from the Eastern cities to the Orient, and, as
The Call pointed out at the time, Eastern goods
"have been taken in such quantities that when the
Peking was in port before its last trip to the Orient
San Francisco people were notified that no freight
from San Francisco shippers would be received for'
that trip."
It happened that at the time large orders from the
Orient had been received in this city, and the goods
were awaiting shipment, but owing to the discrimina
tions in favor of Eastern goods the San Francisco
merchants were compelled to disappoint their
oriental customer?.
The new schedule went into effect December 1.
I9oo. v It applies to freights to Yokohama, Kobe, Nag
asaki, Shanghai and Hongkong. It gives on canned
Roods a rate of 90 cents to the Orient from all East
ern points, while the rate on the same goods from the
Ea?t tn San Francisco rs $1, and the rate from thi?
city to the Orient is 40 cents, making the total rate
for San Francisco shipments $1 40 against the 90 cent
1 ate given to the Eastern exporters. Other articles
of export are rated in similar proportions, so that the
schedule, is, in fact, destructive to the commercial in
terests of San Francisco, whether it was so intendei
â¢ It is to be noted that the New Yorkers themselves
do not support Vice President Hawley in his conten
tion that "there has been no new development to
bring the subject into special prominence." The very
dispatch that reported his denial reported also that
New York merchants are complaining that the same
schedule is a discrimination against their trade in the
interests of Chicago, and. furthermore, it confirmed
the statements of The Call by adding: â¢ "A careful
comparison (of the rates of the schedule) shows that
on many commodities the rates from New York to
the Orient are not only much less than the combined
rates from New York to San Francisco and from San
Francisco to th"e Orient, but that they are actually be
low the rates from New York and Chicago to San
Francisco."
President Hays of the Southern Pacific Company,
in responding to the welcome given him by the mem
bers of the, Chamber of Commerce in tKis city, stated
that he would at all times gladty confer with our mer
chants and manufacturers' concerting transportation
problems, and that as far as he could do so
injury to his employers, the stockholders of the road,
he would cordially co-operate with'our merchants and
manufacturers' in advancing the interests of the coast.
The time has come for the merchants and manufac
turers to take him at his word. The existing sched
ule of oriental rates is destructive to the commercial
industries .of the city, and rcsolnte and combined ef
forts should be. made by our people to obtain imme
diate redress
MORE MEN FOr* KITCHENER.
WHILE the people of the Britijh capital are pre
paring for the funeral of the late Queen, and
are considering how best to get the period 'oi
national mourning over before spring so as not to in
terfere with the social festivities of that season and
the sale of colored goods, Lord Kitchener is working
nway in South Africa at the dreary and difficult task
of catching the mobile Boers and putting an end to
the war in time for him to go home and have a share
in the grand ceremonies at the coronation of the
King.
To that end'he is demanding more men and more
horses. The war is one of marches rather than of
battles. The Boer generals manage to score victory
after victory over scattered British dctachment3
simply because they can travel faster than the Brit
ish. To meet the conditions of the problem before
him Kitchener has been for some time past forming
a large force of mounted infantry, and it is not likely
he will undertake any aggressive action until he has
that force thoroughly organized and drilled in the
peculiar tactics the struggle demands.
The war correspondent of the London Times re
cently described the situation by saying: "The truth
is that we have not nearly enough troops out in
South Africa. This may appear a most startling state
ment, but I am convinced it is a true one. When we
marched up to Pretoria we had then only just a suffi
ciency of troops v to guard what we had taken. Since
then we have acquired nearly 800 more miles of rail
way and several more towns. Think for a moment
what the British army has to do in South Africa, and
it will be readily conceded that I am not far from the
truth when I say that we have to furnish from the
ranks of the British army political organizations for
the temporary government of the two new colonies,
municipal police for Pretoria, Johannesburg and
Bloemfontein, a large portion of the staff necessary
for working over 1000 miles of railway, garrisons for
Lbout thirty towns and villages, guards for about forty
bridges, and a long line of defense for the railway, of
which nearly 1800 miles has to be either patrolled or
strongly held. Not a single man thus employed is
available for active operations against the enemy. To
add to these burdens already borne by the army the
Orange River drifts have been held and the line of
fortified posts between Thabanchu and Ladybrand."
Dewet has made a fight that deserves success, but,
unfortunately for him, he is opposed by an empire
of almost exhaust) ess resources. The tactics he has
pursued' cannot win against a foe that is able and
willing to pay the cost. As fast as British gold can
purchase them horses will be bought and forwarded
tc Kitchener, nor will there be lacking the men to
make use of them.
The British general is a man who moves slowly. It
took him two years to move down upon the Souda-.
to attack the Mahdi. He constructed a railroad as he
marched, and did not strike until all things were in
readiness. He has evidently adopted the same poliry
in dealing with Dewet. It is not now a question of
railroads, but one of forming an army of mountei
men. As rapidly as possible that army is being

There is but one thing more to be said. The inves- j
tigation must be comprehensive. It should include :
the whole subject of the relations of the police authori. j
ties toward the gamblers of the city. There is no i
reason why the examination should be confined to j
Chinatown. Let the investigation be thorough. Â¦
tive. The citizens of San Francisco will welcome the :
committee appointed to perform the work. If the i
police authorities be not guilty, it is but right they \
should be freed from the'eharges made against them. !
If any of them be guilty steps should be taken to have j
him brought to answer for the offense.
It is clearly a duty of the State as well as of the j
city authorities to investigate charges of offenses such i
as these, and since in this instance an investigation by !
the municipal government is not to be expected, the i
duty of the*Xegislature to make one becomes impera- j
Under ftie terms of that statute the police authori
ties, if they have permitted gambling to be carried on
upon the payment of money, have been guilty of a '
felony, whether any of the sums so received have been j
converted to their own use or not. Â¦ !
â The charges have been made specifically and openly.
It has been stated that there will be no lack of testi
mony,. to prove that there exists a "corrupt bargain"
between "the Police Department and the criminals
of Chinatown"; that it will be possible to show
"even more than moral proof that of the $2000 a week
collected for the protection of gambling in China
town a large part finds its way into the pockets of
people not unconnected with the Police Department."
Charges of such a definite and specific nature, made
publicly, are not to be ignored. It is a matter that
concerns the Legislature, for if the charges be true a
State law has been violated. Section 337 of the Penal
Code says: "Every State, county, city, city and
county, town or township officer, or other person,
who shall ask for, receive collect any money or
other valuable consideration, either for his own or
the public use, for and'with the understanding that he
will aid, exempt or otherwise assist any person from
arrest or conviction for a violation of section 330 of
the Penal Code (prohibiting gambling games), or who
shall issue, deliver or cause to be given or delivered
to any person or persons any license, permit or other
privilege, giving or pretending to give any authority
or right to any person or persons to carry on, conduct,
open or cause to be opened, any game or games which
are forbidden or prohibited by section 330 * * "*
is guilty of a felony."
BY the action of the Legislature in appointing a
committee to investigate charges made againsl
the police authorities of this city in relation to
their dealings with the" proprietors of gambling houses
and other violators of the law an opportunity will be
afforded the people of learning the truth concerning
matters of grave importance to the public. For that
reason there will be general gratification with the ap â¢
pointment of the committee, and the gratification will
be increased if the committee prosecutes its work
with thoroughness and impartiality.
A NEEDED. INVESTIGATION.
The Death Penalty.
The lawmakers must deal with condi
tions as they areâ not with conditions
that might exist in an ideal word. I Tnero
are crimes which the public conscience
declares- merit punishment by death, and
when punishment by death is not pro
vided by law it will be inflicted outside
the law and with disorders which reflect
discredit upon the law. The mature opin
ion of the News Is that the death penalty
should be restored in this State, the fixing
of the punishmentâ whether death or Im
prisonment â belnÂ« left in the. hands of the
jury- No jury will take the responsibility
of naming the death penalty unless the
crime is of a nature which outrages every
instinct of humanity.â L>enver News.

ests that their government shall not decline to the
turbulence and instability of Hayti, where President
Simon Sam's relations with a French milliner nearly
precipitated a domestic revolution and a foreign war,
or of San Domingo, where assassination is employed
to effect a change in the administration.
Xor is it desirable that commercially the island
shall fall to the low plane of Jamaica. <&
Cuba under proper tutelage may, by and by, ex
hibit a condition of progress and prosperity that will
make her the leader, by example, to guide Hayti and
San Domingo to a better way than they have follower!
since they received their misused independence. It i*
even possible that some of the nations of Central and
South America may in the future go to Cuba, study
her way and be wiser Governments than they are now.
. The United States should go "as far as our plighted
word permits in starting Cuba toward a position of
such importance to herself and her neighbors.
THE reported proposition of the Cabinet to
exercise the powers of limitation upon Cuba in
three particulars is* not of a nature to rouse any
apprehension that our pledges will not be kept.
It is proposed, -in the first place, to undertake that
Cuba shall not become embroiled in such a foreign
war as might involve her conquest by a European
power, in violation of the Monroe doctrine. This will
mean the continual tender of our good offices to ar
mnge by diplomacy any burning issue that may arise
between the new republic and any of the great powers
of Europe. As, under fhe Monroe doctrine, we would
have the righ$ to intervene at the close of such a war.
providd it .closed, as would probably be the case, to
the disadvantage of Cuba, to prevent the assertion
by right of conquest to. sovereignty of her soil, much
trouble may be avoided by reserving the right to inter
vene before such a war with such a probable outcome
is undertaken by the peppery island. This limitation
of the war power will conduce to the welfare of the
people, since it will turn their energies away from
arms to the arts of peace, and will employ them in
developing the economic resources of the island and
in the education and elevation of the people.
The next limitation proposed is that in the making
of commercial treaties the United States shall not be
ignored nor demoted for the benefit of other nations.
France 'made such an arrangement with us in 1778 as
the price of her alliance in our Revolution against
Great Britain. It is true that we violated the French
obligation as soon as we were strong enough to do.
so, and Cuba may do the same with us if she get
strong enough. That contingency, however, does not
make it any less prudent to have such a plain agree
ment now, leaving the future to take care of itself as
to the permanence of the understanding.
The third limitation i-s upon the volume of the for
eign debt Cuba may contract. It will be seen that the
three limitations are interdependent, and all bear upon
issues out of which war and its complications may
come." A foreign debt may easily be the means of
forcing a favorable and exclusive commercial treaty,
and such an exclusive treaty may be the proximate
cause of a foreign war. Therefore the three proposi
tions all merge in one, and its purpose is to preserve
the peace and therefore induce the prosperity of the
island republic
While our interest is hardly secondary to the, Cu
bans' in such a result, yet they need such a policy

foreign affairs. %

Board of Trade Directors Prepare to
Bj commend That It Shall
Be Abolished.
Collection day In San 'Francisco 'will
again be on trial before the annual meet
ing of the San Francisco Board of Trade
next Monday. The board of directors will
recommend that the members of the
board, so far as they are concerned, shall
dispense with further observance of this
day. The assembled 'merchants will de
cide whether or not they have further
use for the day.
A. A. Watkins, president of the Board
of Trade, favors dolnp away" with collec
tion day. Sanford Bennett, who has
drawn a resolution to give up collection
day, also is opposed to continuing the old
practice. He said last evening that he
had been requested to draw up^a resolu
tion and he had done -so. There was no
substitute proposed for , collection day'.
All that there was to the movement was
to give San Francisco the same general
business system as Eastern cities. The
present collection day is the "steamer

TO SAIL.
Toward the southeast countless Island-?,
great and small; succeed each other for
thousands of miles in Indescribable confu
sion. I Geographers contend as to where
the Asiatic insular system end3 and the
Australian system begins. Toward the
direct south In the Indian Ocean the isl
ands are few In number and generally
small. Ceylon looms as an exception op
posite the mainland ff India. But the-
Mediterranean plants Cyprus in the anglo
formed by its Immense gulf, between Sy
ria and Asia Minor, i;r.d the Aegean Sea
is a maze of Islands, which resemble step
ping stones across an enormous brook.
From the creation as far as natural
causes icould-determlne. it was fixed that
the future history of Asia should be
wrought out and its main influence exert
ed in the direction of the southwest and
west. When its superfluous population
should be ready to .swarm they wouM
find the Paclflo Ocean too broad and thÂ«
lands beyond too indefinite for them to
plunge toward the unknown. The natural
law of emigration would prevent th-Ir
pushing southward ovtr the countless J_l
ands of the southeast toward the equator.
An 1 individual, for the sake of, some reil
or Imagined profit, mav remove far to the
south or north. But a horae or multitude
of men set in motion without a definite
and well-known end almost Invariably
proceeds toward the cast or west. The
law of femigration is ihat tendency which
Impels the emigrant to follow parallel*
of latitude, or, expressed with greater
accuracy, Isothermal lines. An onrushini;
mass of humanity, when 'changing ltd
habitatldn under the spell of same
dominant impulse, s by instinct In
cliried to avoid a oMmate much
warmer or. colder- than that to
which it is accustomed. This " inclina
tion operated still more strongly in primi
tive times, when maa had made litt'e
progress in resisting the forces of nature
and was still the subject of climatic con
ditions. Nevertheless, .though modlfled.
It-stiU exists. and has its share In impel
ling the waves of emigration directly
The farther we journey westward, the
richer ; the â¢ opportunities for intercourse
and communication which the shores pre
sent. At last We reach Asia Minor, but
tressed at its base against the Armenian
plateau, and except for that base an
island surrounded by European seas. Be
cause of Its geographic position it seems
stretching out to proffer all that Asia carl
produce and to accept all that the we3t
can bestow.
It's general outline is far less broken
than that of Europe, while less uniform
than that of Africa/ For every 52S
square miles of territory it has but onÂ©
mile of. coa^t line. This proportion Is
much more like that of Africa than of
Europe. But the broad rivers, seldom
obstructed by sand bars at their mouths
or By falls and rapids in the lower portion
of their course in some degree counter
balance this" disadvantage. Yet on the
other hand, the great northern streams,
the Obi, the .Yeriesei and the Lena, which
on the map look so favorable to naviga
tion, in How-Ing northward pass from a
warmer to a colder latitude and are
blocked by Ice a large portion of the year.
The greatest monotony of surface and
contour will be -found In the extreme
north. That, however, concerns us very
little. On the edge of those dreary Si
berian marshes, which the polar summer
is hardly long enough to thaw, it is doubt
ful if man ever will succeed in overcom
ing the obstacles which glacial nature
throws In his way. As we proceed down
the eastern coast the diversity of outline
increases. South of the forty-first paral
lel we encounter the peninsulas of Korea
and Slam-Annam. Along the coast are
splendid and capacious harbors, many of
which human skill has as yet done little
to improve. On the south we meet the
peninsulas of the Deccan or India and of
Arabia; almost continental in their im*
mensity. The shores are forced to recede
far inland by the Bay of Bengal, the
Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
On the north it Is bounded by the 1'olar
Sea. Its farthest point is the Taimur
Peninsula, half way between the Arttlc
clncle and the pole. Only one explorer
has been able to circumnavigate this
Crozen promontory. The Swede Nordens
klold in the famous vessel Vega' rounded
it in 1*78. On the south It is bounded by
the Indian Ocean. Toward the southeast
It sends off its long, attenuated peninsula
of Malacca, which terminates in Cape
RoUmania, about ninety miles from the
equator. On the west It is bounded by a
continuous chafn of straits and seas, all
tributary to the Pacific. * Nowhere does
what may be strictly called the Pacific
Oceaiv touch the shores of continental
Asia. From Kamchatka to Borneo a reef
of islands, of which the Japanese islands
and the Philippines are the most impor
tant, interposes and shuts off that ocean
from its western and inland waters. The
sinuous line, which hems Asia on the
west, has been the line of its influence
and of its real contact with the world.
Europe, the Mediterranean with its
branches and the Black Sea furnish its
western boundaries.
Asia is the most venerable of the con
tinents. Its name suggests associations
and calls forth emotions such as the men
tion of no other continent can inspire.
According to common tradition and the
most credible deductions of science it wa3
the cradle of the human race. From this
ancestral home by various pathways in
prehistoric times the different races of the
human family marched to populate the
other divisions of the globe.
It' was the cradle of civilization. Here
man first emerged from barbarism. The
earliest and most primitive civilization,
of which we have any account, was its
product. Hence as from a fountain that
civilization was diffused to those other
countries which it was to emulate and
stimulate, while retaining for centuries
something of its original type.
It was the cradle of government ana
law. In it were seated the oldest and
most powerful empires. Egypt is the only
country which In antiquity, in develop
ment of the arts of life and in political at
tainments could vie with those Oriental
monarchies. But Egypt was itself more
modern. Moreover, Egypt was always
Asiatic rather than African. Always it
turned its back upon the continent of
which geographically it was the north
eastern part and all its interests and con
nections were linked with the East.
Asia was the cradle of religion. Every
great religion which has endured and re
tained its millions of adherents through
the centuries had its rise there. Nor is
this true merely of the fnlths whose ori
gin is lost In legend and mythology. It is
equally true of those more vigorous and
more tenacious, like Christianity and Jsl
lam, which have appeared long after the
dawn of authentic history.
So, at the very, mention of â¢ Asia is
evoked the consciousness of an unap
proachable pra-emlnence. The birthplace
of mankind, of civilization, of govern
ment and law and of religion. In compar
iso'n what'could the other continents cre
ate and bequeath?
These priceless bequests were to be re
ceived, applied and carried further by Eu
rope. By her they were In "turn to be be
stowod upon the Americas, Australia and
Africa. Even in the strange evolution of
time they were by her to be brought back
to Asia, their source. And yet, when we
seek the beginnings of what Is imperisha
ble and most precious in human achieve
ment, Asia is the mother of us all. .
Asia far surpasses the other continents
in size. It includes more than two-sev
enths, almost one-third, of the land sur
face of the globe. Its area of 15,000,000
square mile's- Is four times larger than
that of Europe, nearly equal to that of
Europe and Africa and exceeds that of
North and Sotith America. Upon the. map
of the eastern hemisphere it impresses not
only with the idea of vastness, but of
positional superiority. It seems to thrust
'Europe but from It toward the west
as its broadest . and most gi
gantic cape, and to suspend Af
rica from it as "its most gigantic penin
sula. Both are attached to it as depend
encies, while it exists independent of
them. On the northeast, along the line of
the Arctic circle, it projects a narrow
arm to within less than forty miles' dis
tance of the western extremity of Alaska.

ing of difficulties, with the decision in
favor of the least.
When the habitats of mankind became
overpacked with human beings one of two
courses was sure to be pursued. The in
habitants might srugglshly adapt them
selves to new conditions and remain In
the same spot, enduring; the Increasing
discomforts which arose from want of
room, or the entire population, or only
the more vigorous and energetic In their
number, might desert their accustomed
haunts a*d wander forth In search of
some more generous and less -exhausted
region. So they would set out on an un
certain march, perhaps at last to estab
lish enduring kingdoms, perhaps to perish
and leave their bones along the stray. Re
mote Asiatic history affords many exam
plea of both courses, of the slothful lin
gering on in the midst of diminishing
plenty and of the starting forth to ulti
mate power or to graves In the wilder
ness.
Sometimes the supplies of both water
and food were exhausted. Then no choice
was left the survivors but to depart. This
has been the case more than once with
the people of Central Asia. As the pas
ture: grounds withered the famished no
mads and thelr"""perishln?r herds were
forced to fly. Ravenous and merciless as
wolves, they hurled themselves upon
whatever group of men was nearest, not
impelled so much by lust for booty as
lashed on by devouring: hunger. How far
this motive has been at the base of the
Hunnlc and Mongolian Invasion it Is even
yet impossible to say.
But we must turn our eyes farther bacte
than to the histories or still more shad
owy days when prolific Asia was to rouse
her superfluous children and send them
forth from their first habitation. The
trend of the rivers determines the physi
cal conditions of primitive man and shapes
the manner of early history. The rivers
are themselves the offspring of the moun
tains, which from a myriad sources afford
their, supply and indicate the channels
wherein they are to flow. ' In her moun
tain system is discovered the key of what
Asia has been from the beginning: unttl
now. On those oky-plercing ranges, plied
loftier than the peaks of any other con
tinent, the story of Asia- is written. They
have> shaped the character and decided
the career of the human beings who have
clung along their sides and clustered at
their base. By their obedient agents, the
rivers, which they have tossed throu^i
the ravines and down their flanks, they
have produced the broad alluvial plains,
whereon mankind in hoary antiquity first
passed from brutish ignorance to Incipi
ent civilization. They and their minor
chains through the ages have marked in
every direction the boundaries of long
established dominions. The mountains of
Europe and America have .likewise had
their share in the shaping of human des
tiny. But their part has been, small and
insignificant in comparison with the part
which the mountains of the vastest ana
most venerable of the continents have ex
erted. Herodotus declared of Egypt, "It
Is the gift of the Nile." Asia is the gift
of her mountains. It Is for us to investi
gate her awe-inspiring mountain system.

The Andrada, now out eighty days from
Santa- Rosalia, and the Otto Gilder

at 90 per cent. The Bertha, 100 days out
from Weihaiwei, is selling at 85 per cent,
and the Cape Wrath, nlnenty days from
Callao, at 75 per cent. A few risks have
been taken on the latter vessel.
Discouraging reports from along the
coast have caused the Ardnamurchan and
the Machrihanish to be added to the over
due- fleet. The former fleet, left the
Frazer River on November 26 and the lat

of the same brand of goods haye been
found on the Oregon- beach. "In any
event the underwriters do not like the
looks of â¢ things and are paying the
gamblers 45 per cent to reinsure. The
cargoes of the Arnamurchan and the
Machrihanish alone are valued at $500,000,
while the Bix overdues, without their

There Was Not a Cigar in Acapulco
When Steamer Sydney Arrived
There.
There* was a disgusted lot of officers and
men on the Mail Company's City of Syd
ney yesterday. Hardly a man aboard had
a cigar to smoke, let alone one to offer to
a friend. When the steamship reached
Acapulco It was the Intention of all
hands to lay in a supply, but when they
got there all the fragrant weeds were
gone. The battleship Iowa and the cruiser
Philadelphia had been there and the mer
chants ot Acapulco said the officers and
men of the warships had laid in a supply
of 250,000 cigars?, thus cleaning out all the
supply on hand. The men on the Sydney
say the merchants of Acapulco would
willingly have purchased cigars from

CLOSING
The failure of the bank to reduce the bank
rate )iÂ»rl no effect whatever. The American
department was cheerful at the opening, trad
ing grew more and more brisk, and after a
session which was active throughout, closed at
the liveliest, with prices at the best. The
lead came from New York, whence there
were many buying orders, especially In the
Union Pacific shares. These Ehares and the
Southern Pacifies were in great demand on the
consummation of the Mobile and Ohio deal.
Money continued stiff. Call loans were made
at 4H-
Business on the Stcck Exchange was pretty
good to-day. The tone was more satisfac
tory since the settlement has been concluded
without any fresh outbreak of the troubles
from the West Australians. It is hoped now
that this is all over.

Bootblack Stands Escape Tax.
Because the Board of Public Works,
the Tax Collector and the Police Depart
ment will not agree as to the responsibil
ity of enforcing tho ordinance Imposing: a
license on bootblack stands maintained
upon the public- sidewalks, this city is
losing a considerable sum* of money. ThÂ«
ordinance was passed by the Supervisors
last August, yet since that time licenses
have been collected on but eighteen stands
at the rate of Yi per chair, amounting to
$177. It is conceded tnat. there axe at least
fifty* stands that havd escaped paying li
censes owing to the neglect of some one
of the departments named.' In a letter
written to the Mayor a while ago the
Board of Public Works acknowledged
that many stands were operating without
permits.

CONDITIONS IMPOSED IN
PROPOSED FRANCHISE
James F. J. Archibald, the war corre
spondent, told an audience last nlsrht at
Sherman & Clay Hall pf his experiences
with the Boer and British armies In the
Transvaal campaign. Mr. Archibald
inakes no pretensions to forensic excel
lence, and. In lact. took occasion- to in
form his auditors by means of the pror
gramme that "being no orator, he did not
covet a pesition on the lecture platform,"
but withal his talk was both entertaining
and lnstructlva. The lecture was artis
tically Illustrated by stereoptlcon views
that presented every phase of the conflict,
from its first battles to the recent descent
by the Boers on Cape Colony.
Mr. Archibald's sympathies are appar
ently with the burghers, although his de
scriptions of. the English campaign were
lueld and fair. The lecturer dwelt at
length an the sturdy stubbornness of the
Boer generals and troops, but declared
that the lack of discipline In -their ranks
would long ago have resulted in the an
nihilation of any other civilized army.
He explained that the chief difficulty, en
countered by the English was in main
taining their lines of communication, and
also declared that the reports of the Boer
army having fired on the Red Cross hos
pital corps were in every Instance due to
mistakes and an Inability to distinguish
at a distance *he corps flag.

evening.

LECTURE ON THE BOER WAR
BY JAIKES F. J. ARCHIBALD
Fresh From the .'Scene of Hostilities
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County,
who has the case In charge, is in Sacra
mento. McGulre. an important witness
from Point Richmond, where Stendel's
body was found, waB not present .
"We, the Jury, do find that the name of
the deceased was Herman A. Stendel and
that he came to his death about -Decem
ber 20, 1900. and that death was caused
by rupture of the coronal vessels in the
brain produced from some source un
known to the Jury."
â¢ Dr. Eastman is still very ill and Coroner
Mehrmann took his deposition this morn
ing. Â¦ He testified that the rupture of the
arteries In the top of the brain had
created a blood clot sufficient to cause
death. The bruises on the head were not
heavy enough to warrant being called
ante-mortem and whether the ruptured
arteries were caused by a sudden rush
of blood to* .the head or a blow, the
autopsy physician was unable to state.
There was no evidence of drowning.
BERKELEY, Jan. 31.â The completion
of the inquest in the Herman Stendel case
leaves the cause of death still a mystery.
After hearing the deposition of Dr. J. S.
Eastman, the autopsy physician, this
evening the Jury rendered the following
verdict:
Inquest Fails to Solve Mys
tery of Herman Stendel's
Demise.
CRUSE OF DEATH
STILL UNDECIDED
TOPEKA, Kans., Jan. 31.â Mrs. Carrie
Nation, the Jolflt smasher, armed with a
brand new hatchet, started on a crusada
against the Topeka Joints at 8:30 thU
morning. v She called on five of the best
known places. The Apex, the finest saloon
In the city, was first visited, but no dam
age was done. She was put out of the
place. She said she did not want to b-a
destructive, but merely wanted to lecture.
However, should violence be shown on
their part, she said she Intended getting
In her work.
A crowd of several hundred people fol
lowed her down tho street, most of whom
were sympathizers. The police tried to ar
rest her. but the crowd interfered and
prevented it. Mr?. Nation says the Lord's
mission to her. "Clear all Joints In To
peka out before leaving." will be fulfilled,
and if the authorities do not suppress tho
joints she will s'mash them, using rocks
and hatchet.
Mrs. Nation wore an old gray shawl and
carried an ordinary handbag. When shÂ«
appeared at the different Joints the own
ers stood back of the -barricaded doors
â¢and awaited an attack. She begged them
to let her In that she might talk to them,
promising not to harm anything. But
they were afraid of her and would not
open the doors. Nothing daunted she
talked at then}, after this fashion:
"I'm sorry for you. boys. You look so
much ashamed of yourselves. I am not
mad at you. boys. I am not hating you
a bit. -even when I come around with my
hatchet. I am treating you just as I
should treat one of my own boys If I
found him with something that would do
him harm.
"But. boys, you must not stay In this
business any longer. I give you fair
warning. Just you close up and get out
of this business. You are hannini* your
selves and other boys and I won't le.t you
do that. If you don't get out of this,
boys. I'll be around In a few days and
just break up your wicked little shops for
you."
Incredible as It may appear, the saloon
men were strongly moved by the talk Mrs.
Nation gave them. She meant what shÂ»
said â they understood that. They knew
she was not resentful and did not despise
them just as they understood how re
solved she was to make them close their
joints.
Mrs. Nation made a short talk to a clasa
at Washbum College this morning, speak
ing to the boys about cigarettes and
cigars. In the chapel of the colleire a min
ister was speaking. Mrs. Nation regarded
him for a moment, then leaned over to a
man near her and said:
"Won't you ask that man on thÂ« stage
to let me speak to these boys about nva
minutes? He's giving them too much
chaff. I want to give them a few' grains
of wheat."
But she was not permitted to talk.

SMASHER'S TOUR
WITH A HATCHET
This depredation, he said, was uni
versally conceded to approximate 2 .per
cent annually on the original cost.
In spite of Judge Hayne's objections
McCutchen carried the. witness through a
maze of problems in law and equity with
the alleged purpose of testing the basis
of his computations.
"Would your estimate hold good If a
water company were doing business at a
loss?" he asked.
"My figures deal with value only,"
answered the witness. "What income a
company should have is ajegal question."
"Well, now, supposing tnat *you were a
Juror "
"Your Honor, this thing has gone far
enough," objected Havne. "We have put
this witness on as an expert engineer; he
has testified to certain calculations: he
isn't a lawyer, he isn't a Judge, he Isn't
a juror. This examination is simply for
the purpose of confusing the witness, and
provoking him Into admissions, which he
does not understand, against his will."
The court held that the questions of
Mr. McCutchen went to the expert's com
petency to testify and during the remaind
er of the hearing Riffle was called upon to
decide various intricate legal problems
offhand. He finally threw himself upon
the mercy of the court, pleading, as
an excuse for answering no further, that
he made no pretense of being qualified to
testify as an expert in law and equity.
"I thought we'd get iiim if we kept at
It long enough," chuckled McCutcHen. i
"Well, now. you- haven't got anything
nor anybody," retorted Hayne. You seem
to think that the court is dependent upon
this witness for his law, but that is hard
ly the case."
The cross-examination will proceed to
morrow mornins.
Mr. Riffle said that he regarded the
present value of the Contra Costa plant
as determined by tho cost of reproduc
tion less depreciation.
' The water company's attorneys were
unable to develop anv errors in the esti
mates themselves and turned their atten
tion to the theory the witness entertained
on the valuation of water plants in gen
eral.
To-day's hearing of the water rate case
was taken up with the cross-examination
of Engineer A. S. Riffle, whose figures on
the value of the Contia Costa Company's
system were submitted yesterday.

No sooner had the excited female voice

The patrol wagon was hurried down to
Sixth and Market streets as fast as the

capture the bold man who dared to op

This was not enough, and Detectives
Kyte and Hammerton were shipped down

In the political .arena piits on the ap

was that- some of the members were

ticket which is broached by certain inter

a movement their onlv chance to win.
This Idea was strengthened, too, because
nearly the 'entire membership of- the par

cide of James Elwell, formerly conduc
tor on the California Northwestern Rail
way on the local run between San. Rafael
and San Francisco. Elweli said when he
left he would never come back until he
had made his stake, and his suicide proves
that he had given up all hope of acquir

home two months ago. . He endeavored to
induce Elwell to accompany him, but to
no avail. "I'll go out of here with a sack
or in a sack," was his terso way of allud

outlook became bleaker as the weather
grew colder, and. finally he ended his- life
with a bullet from his revolver. His

Attempt to Raise the Sum
of $l6,OOO.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 31.â Ten thousand dol
lars is the amount to be collected to be
used In the reception of President Mc-
Kinley in May, and next week commit
tees will begin a systematic canvass for
subscriptions. This was decided upon at
a meeting of the general committee last
evening.' It is believed no difficulty will
be experienced in raising the money. The
amount will be used solely for decora
tions and reception. All the flowers that
will be needed are now being . planted,
and there will be no lack of these and no
expense for them.
From all parts of the county offers of
help are being received, and the whole
courity is taking an interest in the floral
fete. Each locality will prepare a mag
nificent floral float.
It Is proposed to make the reception the
finest accorded the President anywhere
on his trip. If he can be persuaded to re
main over night there will be a banquet
and ball, which for gorgeousness and
beauty has never been equaled on the
coast. The carnival of roses will be held
for three days. Besides a great floral
parade there will probably be all kinds
of amusements. The orchards and flower
gardens of the Santa Clara Valley will be
in their greatest bloom at the time, and
this vicinity will be as a glimpse of the
realm of Flora to the President and his
party.

to be a s=hip on fire. Th<Â» Barcelona head- ]
c<3 toward the Ifeht and on approaching j
nearer ttra h-jge flares were seen from a j
vessel In â¢Ustress. Parsing close by the :
craft Captain Bohn with his night glass i
rcade vat that she was dismasted and j
WAtcflageeO and the people on the wreck i
were waving and gesticulating; violently.
At time? hoarse shouts could be heard.
and- finally cries of "Help, we are sink- ]

n.pn sea was running it wa. c decided to
make me attempt to rescue the ship
wrecked crew. ' First Officer A. Uvonl
R.n<l a boat crew of five seamen managed
to lower a Mfcboat and Â«vt eafely away I
from ihe fide of the steamer. After an j
exceedingly hard pul! the boat was- sue- |

wreck end after a severe struggle all of
the men, fifteen In number, were taken

The Cuba loft Ship Island with a full
<-arÂ£o of tlirber. bound for Bristol, Eng
land. She mÂ»Â»t a succession of g-ales with
very rough seas and the resultant pound

was ktpt constantly at the pumps, but in
rpiie of their exertions the water gained
ur.til the hold was half full of water.
On January 15 a terrific pale arose from
the southeast which blew with hurricane.

l-.oaia end*. After efforts to right her had
failed the marts were cut away and the |
peal In falling smashed all the boats. I
'â¢.'he pumps were kept going, but the seas
washed completely over the craft, keep-
Jr.p- the crew immersed In water. In this
condition the vessel lay throughout the

eral steamers passed by, one very close

HELP WANTEDâ FEMALE.SAN JOSE, JanI 31.â A general" advance
in . the prices of wines | has been made by
the local dealers. Sweet wines have gt>ne
up from 9 to 12 cents per > ; gallon and
clarets and white wines have advanced 5
to 8 cents per gallon. ' The wholesalers say,
the sole cause of the advance is the rav
ages of phylloxera, which has made such
inroads : on â¢ the Â¦ vineyards of .this valley.
It is Baid that nearly -75 per cent of the
old vines have , succumbed. The drought
of the past few years has spread the phyl
loxera : in this valley, i and if is estimated
the product, which has been as high as
6,000,000 gallons, has dropped to 1,000,000.
Price of Wines Advanced.
The programme will include all the cus
tomary Grand Army ceremonies, to
gether with daily sessions of the depart
ment delegates (Department of California

honor and other â¢ specially prepared and
elaborate features. It Is the intention
of the committee arid the citizens gener
ally-to make the celebration the most
notable of its kind ever held on the Pa
cific Coast. â¢
PACIFIC GROVE, Jan. 31.â Active
preparations are now fully under way for
the great Grand Army of the^Republic
celebration at this place In May next.
A 'meeting of the executive committee
having the celebrationjn charge was held
in the office of Chairman Eardly last
night and a great deal of business rela
tive to the financial side of affairs was
transacted. It Ja understood that the
Monterey County Board of Supervisors
will makoan appropriation toward meet
ing the. heavy expense. â¢ .
Owing to the fact that President Mc-
Kinley, who is to be present, has as yet
been unable to definitely fix the dates for
his visit to the Pacific. Coast, the dates
for the ftceleb ration here can only be set
tled approximately, but it is believed It

SAN JOSE, Jan. 31.â An attempt 'was
made to blow up and burn the clubhouse
of the Kip Sing Tong on Taylor street,
between Fourth and Fifth, this morning.
A loud explosion preceded the blaze,
v/hlch was set in a wooden building ad-
Joining, and when the firemen arrived on
the f=cene thev found the Hip Sing fra
ternity guarding their house with rifles
and revolvers. At first tho Chinese tried
to' stop the firemen from entering the
building to extinguish the flames, but
when shown badges they gave way. The
Celestials believed a faction with which
they are waring had set the. fire and In
tended to roast them alive or shoot them
as they emerged from the building. The
building destroyed was owned by Z. Spl
nola, whose loss will be $500. A wine
dealer, A. Massina, who occupied tho
place, loses about $1000. The Chinese club
house was but slightly damaged.
ATTEMPT TO DESTROY -
CHINESE CLT7BHOTTSE
A host of other amendments were ruled
out. After completing fourteen of the
twenty-four pages of the bill the House
at 5:20 p. m. adjourned. .
Lentz of Ohio offered a series of amend
ments for the graduation of the salaries
of clerks In charge of stations and sub
stations. They were defeated.
The fortifications bill was passed and
the postofflce appropriation bill taken up.
Loud explained the measure, which lie.
said .carried S122,7S2,GÂ«8, being $1,515,333
more than the estimates and f9.124.150
more than the appropriation for the cur
rent year. By amendment the appropria
tion for salaries of postmasters was In
creased from $19,000,000 to $20,000,000. j
Lanham was loudly applauded and con
gratulated by the Democrats when he con
cluded.
The talk of shelving Mr. Bryan, he said,
was premature. He had fallen with his
back to the field and his face to the foe.
He was a splendid American citizen and
a Democrat. It was improbable that he
would ever again aspire to the nomina
tion, but it was too early to discuss the
candidates of the future. The party had
split upon the silver question. Lanham
pointed out that no matter how firm the
silver Democrats stood to their faith, .un
der present conditions the hope of bimet
allism would be long delayed. If it should
turn out that the silver question should
not be a dlstutblng question in the next
convention, what obstacle was there to a
complete reunion? If those who had de
parted should not to absorb, but
to reassociate themselves -with Democ
racy, said Lanham, why should they not
be received? But they must come pro
pared to subscribe to the cardinal doc
trine of the partyâ acquiesce in the will
of the majority.
Lanham was given a very attentive
hearing by his political colleagues. He
reviewed the lines of cleavage within the
party with a view to ascertaining wheth
er there was not a common ground upon
which the various elements in the party
could be reunited for a future purpose. He
offered his suggestions, he paid. In a pa
ciflc spirit, to ascertain whether the gulf
between the elements was impassable.
The gold Democrats, he said, who bore
none of the scars of battle, now, with
unbridled audacity, did not propose to re
turn like the prodigal son in humility, but
came demanding as a condition of their
return that they should head the proces
sion. They offered very freely their'un
solicited service. The talk of the reor
ganization of the Democratic party, he
said, was puerile and unkind. The talk of
changing the name of the party was dis
tasteful to the rank and file. The Demo
cratic party had suffered defeat many
times, but It would survive so long as
free institutions did.
Many amendments were offered to the
postoffice appropriation bill in the interest
of various items of postofflce employes,
but they all went down before points of
order raised by Loud, the chairman of
the Postoflice Committee, who was in
charge of the bill.
"WASHINGTON", Jan. 31.â The House to
day passed the fortifications appropriation
bill and made fair progress
with the postoffice appropriation
bill. .-During the general debate upon the
former bill Lanham of Texas delivered a
notable speech upon the future of the
Democratic party, in which he made a
strong plea for the necessity of a united
Democracy and counseled the burial of
thf hatchet and the welcoming back of
those who in the last two Presidential
campaigns have declined to support the
nominees of the party.
The existing laws relating to the tax on
bills of exchange is amended so as to
read as follows:
Bills of exchange (foreign) or letters of credit
(including ordera by telegraph or otherwise
fof the payment of money, issued by express
or other companies, or any person or persons)
drawn in but payable out. of the United States

three or more, according to the oustom of
merchants and bankers, shall pay for a sum
not exceeding 1 $100 two cents, and for. each $100
or fractional part thereof in excess of $100
two cents;- if drawn in sets of two or more,
for every bill of each set, where thÂ« sum
made payable shall- not exceed $100 or the
equivalent thereof, In any foreign currency
<n which said bill may i>e expressed accord-
Ing to the standard of value fixed by the
United States, one cent; and for each $100 or
fractional part thereof In excess of 1100, onÂ«
cent.

ence report of the bill was agreed to.

hdd agreed to the report.

the Senate constantly to-day, even the
shipping . bill - giving way. Opposition to
the bill continued to' be vigorously ex
pressed, Teller â¢ making an extended
speech. in criticism of the War Depart
ment and of the measure in general. An
opposition developed on the Republican

freedom which the conferees had taken
in introducing new provisions. On the

bill. . "

FIVE YEARS FOR
GIVING "DROPS"
The Assembly Committee on Commerco
and Navigation enjoyed a rather pleasant
Junketing trip to. this city yesterday and
returned- on the evening train to Sacra
mento. The committee came here for thÂ«
ostensible purpose of viewing the pro
posed site for a free public market but 5n
reality the majority of .them cared more
for the mileage they were earning than
for the performance of legislative duties.
The trip was not as pleasant as it might
have been, for it was cold and windy on
the water front when ihe members, mar
shaled by Colonel Martin Brady, chair
man of the committee, reached' Bast
street. To their credit be it said, how
ever, they spent nearly an hour . on
the city front looking exceedingly wisa
while mentally figuring out I what their
mileage would amount to. That thÂ« bill
introduced by Assemblyman Radcliff, pro
viding that after thÂ«s first day of next
July the blocks and fractional blocks of
State property bounded bv Pacific, Davis
and East streets, shall be part of tha
free public market established by an act
approved March 29, 1S37. will be reported
adversely upon by the committee, is al
most an assured fact. The majority of
the members evldentlv had their minds
made up to vote asalnst the bill before
leaving Sacramento, but, "as an evidence
of good faith" and in order to earn mile
age, they visited the oite.
Assemblyman Radciiff. who introduce!
the measure, accompanied the committee
and on his invitation Colonel Edward F.
Adams, a fruit grower of Watsonvllle.
who has made a study of the needs for a
free public market, was also present.
Adams first took the . committeemen to
Jackson and Washington street wharves
and explained to them now fruit and other
perishable products were unloaded there
by -the river steamers. â¢ A' considerable
portion of the products is sold at ths
wharves and the remainder is carted off
t'o commission houses, suffering great
damage while In transit to them. "With
a free public market on the site pro
posed," said he, "all *rult and vegetable*
shipped here could be 3afely stored with
out damage. If the shipments were not
sold at once, the goods would be protect
ed and saved from (he damage resulting
from too much handling."
The legislative solons did not see mat
ters In that light. The majority of them
thought the facilities afforded at presen:
were entirely sufficient.
"I think that there is a better site by
the grain sheds at the northern end of
East street." remarked Assemblyman
Brown, "and if you will follow me I think
I can convince you of that fact."
â¢"What Is the use of walking: there,"
ejaculated Chairman Brady. "We ain't
supposed to go chasing 'round. All we've
got to do is to look at the site proposed
In the bill."
Â«.Â»r?M. ess that 's s o." remarked Brown.
Might- as well eo ud town."
The commltteemen went into executive
session for a few minutes and decided to
walk around the boundaries of the site
proposed in Radcllff's bill. After the trip
they separated and went "up town,"- firs*
agreeing to meet on the evening train fo 1 "
Sacramento.
Does Not Meet With Favor
in Ejes of Solons of the
Assembly...
PUBLIC MARKET
SITE IS DOOMED
The motive for the shooting was the
fact that the highbinders believed that
Lum Yow, who is a Christianized Chinese,
gave information to the mission people as
to where slave girls were kept in China
town and a reward of $1000 was offered
to any highbinder who killed him. Lum
Yow was married to a slave girl, Youn
How, who was rescued by the Presbyte
rian Mission people from a life of shame.
This was another serious offense against
him in the eyes of the highbinders. Lum
Yow*s wife was taken to the hospital by
Miss Cameron to see him, and was later
taken to the mission, as it was feared an
attempt would be made to kidnap her.-
Lum Yow had $96 in his pockets when
searched at the hospital. He requested
Miss Cameron if he should die to send
his wife back to China, so that she might
not fall into the hands of the high
binders.
This city is again favored in that the
officers necessary to carry out "mustering
out instructions" must be thoroughly fa
miliar with the work, and the plan "of
sending the men to their homes for dis
charge would require too many officials,
whereas, If the entire twenty-five regi
ments are mustered out here one board
of officials could perform all the work.
Out at the Presidio camps are being
rapidly prepared for the reception of the
Thirty-seventh Regiment, <lue to arrive
here about Februarys. Accompanying
these . volunteer* is Colonel Jocelyn. who
has had a great Ccal of experience Jn the
work of mustering out men. having had
charge of the discharge of the volunteers
on the conclusion of the Spanish war
The revleW of artfllery. infantry an d
cavalry at the Presidio .yesterday morn
ing was a brilliant spectacle. Colonel
P.awles expressed himself as greatly de
lighted with the ofilcers and men who
took part.
It requires three weeks' time to muster
out the 12CÂ»0 men comprising a regiment,
and the chipping of tentage And the nec
essary camp outfits from here to the
mustering out point would prove a matter
of considerable cost.
It Is now almost an assured fact that
the volunteer soldiers . will be mustered
out In this city, instead of being sent to
points throughout the country where, the
regiments were organized. For the last
few weeks the War Department officials
have been making careful estimates of
the cost of transporting the volunteers
to the points nearest their home's and that
of giving them their discharges here, and
have about decided it is advisable to mus
ter out in San Francisco. An item of
considerable Importance in the expense
Js the erection of camps for the men.
If they axe mustered out in the States
Â¦where the regiments were organized the
entire regimental outfit will have to be
shipped to the point selected, where, as
soon as the men are discharged, it will
be necessary to hire a large force of men
to pack the tentage, arms, ammunition
and camp utensils for shipment to this
city, where they: are needed for the boI
<ilers to be sent to the Islands to replace
the volunteers. .

Lum Yow was a cook in a private fam- |
lly near his residence. He had been to
Fish alley buying fish and provisions,
which he placed in a basket. He was car
rying the basket on his back up Clay
street when Quon Ah - You and Quon
Quock Wah, members of the See Yup
Society, fired from behind at him. Quon
Ah You fired the first shot, which took
effect, but Quon Quock Wah's bullet
missed its mark. The two highbinders
disappeared in Spofford alley. LUm Yow
walked along Stockton street till he
near Stockton, shortly after 3 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. He was shot in the
back, the bullet entering under the left
shoulder blade, coming out in front about
half an inch above and to the left of the
heart and passing through the left lung.
Powder niarks on the back of his blouse
ehowed that the assassins were close to
him when the shot was fired.
Will Again Play Funny Role Which Holds
a Record as a Laugh-Maker.
OMEDIAN AL.F C. WHEELAN,
//^ the original "Hoot Mon," is speed
(l ing toward this city from New
York, having been telegraphed for
by the management of the Tivoli,
and the favorite actor will shortly make
his reappearance at the theater on Eddy
street.
"Hoot Mon" Wheelan has been In Lon
don since he left San Francisco, having
gone to that city with a company play
ing a number of Hoyt's comedies. When
Wheelan played Hoot Mon in "The Idol's
Eye" at. the Tivoli last year the whole
city was convulsed with laughter. Time
and time again did people go to see the
funny caricature of the Scotchman as pre
sented by Wheelan. with the result that
"The Idol's Eye" ran for ten weeks to
crowded houses. The play has made a
fortune for its owners, and much of its
success was due to Wheelan's comicali
ties. "Hoot mon" and "Every one hold
on" - are familiar sayings all over the
United States. The role of Hoot Mon as
played by Wheelan was not written by
the authors of "The Idol's Eye," but was
a conception of Wheelan's. When the
comic opera was written the role assigned
to Wheelan was that of a Scotch dude,
in evening dress. Wheelan was averse to
playing the role, and Frank Daniels, who
was to- produce the play, would allow of
no change. Th3 authors, however, sided
with Wheelan, and on the first night of
"The Idol's Eye" a joke was played on
Daniels. -When Wheelan was to appear
instead of being clad in evening. dress he
was attired in rags. kilt, fllly-bag and
cap Daniels was so dumfounded that he
had an attack of stage fright and was at
a loss for his lines. "Hoot mon," said
Wheelan, in broad Scotch dialect, and
Daniels, who was fumbling with the skirt
of his costume, undid the hooks and let
the garment fall to the ground. The audi
ence and the company were convulsed
ORIGINAL "HOOT MON" WHEELAN
IS COMING BACK TO THE TIV0LI
ton street, a collector and solicitor for the
"industrial department" of the Pacific Mu
tual LJfe Insurance Company of Califor
nia, with offices at 405 Montgomery street,
wandered into that place about 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon looking as if he and
a buzzsaw had commingled. Later, ac
companied b\ a special agent of the com
pany named Ward, he went to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where he was treated
for all kinds of lacerations of the head
and scalp. He claimed that ho had been
assaulted with a pistol In the hands of
August Pope, an engineer, who lives at 5
Congress street, on the summit of Birena
Vista Hill.
Some time ago Mrs. Popo took out a
policy of insurance on the lives of her
husband and children, without the for
mality of an examination. Pope objected
to the terms of the policy and asked his
wife to order It canceled. She demurred
and a casus belli was established in the
household. From this point family dif
ferences grew until they were magnified
to an alarming degree.
Armbuster went to the house about 2:30
o'clock yesterday afternoon to collect the
pittance coming to the company. Mrs.
Pope told him that she would be unable to
pay until the following collection day.
While they were talking Pope came home
and met his wife and the collector talking
at the door.
The flat occupied by the Popes is at the
top of the hill, with a short flight of steps
leading to it. Mrs. Pope was at the head
of these stairs and Armbuster was at the
hedge surrounding the place, a few feet
away. They were talKing as pleasantly
as could be when she exclaimed:
"There comes my husband."
Pope by this time had sized up the sit
uation, drawn his pistol and attempted
to use it on Armbuster. The trigger
failed to work, but the butt end did on
Armbuster's head, and he came out of
tue affray looking very much the worse
for wear.
Mrs. Pope ran to the house of her
mother, Mrs. Durner, about one hundred
yards away, where her oldest daughter
was at play, and left her husband and
two younger children, Klla, aged less
than two years, and Norman, aged Jive
years, to their father's care. He picked
them up, hatless and coatless, and dis
appeared almost as quickly as the
mother. He went -with the children pre
sumably to the residence of his mother,
Mrs. Heider of Alameda, Armbuster,
with his head swarthed in bandages and
a confused idea of his surroundings at the
Receiving Hospital, said, after promptings
by his friend. "Ward, that he did not
"know how it happened."
"I was standing by the flagpole in front
of the house talking to Mrs. Pope." he
said, "when the husband came along,
pulled out a gun and tried to shoot me.
Tlje trigger failed to work and then he
clubbed me with the pistol. I got it good
hard and plenty, went to my office and
was treated by the local physicians and
then came out to the Receiving Hospital.
I have not the least idea why this assault
was made on me."
Mrs. Pope when seen at the residence
of her mother was at first disinclined to
say anything about the occurrence. Jeal
ousy on the husband's part and the desire
to avoid paying on the insurance policy
she alleges were the chief causes leading
to the afternoon's affray.
"Norman and 1511a," she says, "werÂ»
playing in the sand across the street when
my husband came up the road. Mr. Arm
buster was standing In front of the house
near the flagpole, and I was standing on
the landing on top of the three or four
steps leading to the house. Suddenly my
husband pulled out his pistol and pointed
it at the collector, but It would not work.
Then he hit the old man over the head
with it. I ran to my mother's house,
j where my oldest daughtes was staying for
the afternoon. Then my husband grabbed
the two younger children and disappeared.
I believe he went to his mother's place in
Alameda."
Mrs. Pope, coached by her brothers and
other relatives, was decidedly disinclined
to make any statement. Finally, however,
she admitted that herself and husband
had many differences, and that the Pacific
Mutual Life Insurance Company collector,
who had been a weekly visitor for the last
eight months, had much to do with the
anger of the husband. Pope has been out
of work for the last few days, has been
ugly and morose, but according to his
friends has no just grounds for suspect
ing Armbuster of anything wrong.
Detective Dillon, who was detailed on
the case, endeavored last night to locate
Pope, but was unable to find him. When
arrested he will be charged with assault
to murder, and the mystery of Buena
Vista Heights will be solved either in the
police or divorce courts.
